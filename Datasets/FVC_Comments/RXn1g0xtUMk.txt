<b>Legendary Animal located</b>
as an australian this is surreal, you&#39;ve some friendly gators there, here, you never feel comfortable with a croc being out of an enclosure, if there&#39;s gonna be a nearby croc,you don&#39;t open business there, you open it where the croc won&#39;t be, there&#39;s NO friendly crossing of paths
Breathing heavy like it’s right next him 😒
Rest In Peace Dave 🙏

It honestly looks like godzilla walking or a dinosaur 🦕 walking , specially when it does the high walk 🚶‍♂️
Now that&#39;s a gator. It&#39;s easily between 14 and 17 feet.
A dinosaur

That is the biggest freaking alligator i have ever seen in my life 🤖🦾

Walking with dinosaurs
I hope Dave knew that gators can, in fact, run and quite quickly, when they feel like it.
For a minute I thought it was real
All you need to do is take this video and then add in Jurassic Park music in the background

OMG that looks positively like a dinosaur!! Is this real or some computer generated fake??
I&#39;ve never seen such a gigantic alligator. Is that an alligator or a Crocodile 🐊. And that big guy is in Florida ?!!😮
Guess Godzilla left his clubs home

and everyone else downplays it and let 14 footers be the record.  that&#39;s a freaking dinosaur
Incredible, what a monster! I feel like I&#39;m watching Jurassic Park. Such an amazing sight, to be on a golf course looking at one of the largest alligators in the world, or possibly the largest gator. Looks like he&#39;s just out for a leisurely stroll to a different pond.
Прям динозавр, хоть бы мяса подкинули или вкусняшку какую. 😂
An Alligator can run very fast.  This is not a pet, but a man eating hunters prize.  Not too long ago, a woman walking her dog was killed by one of these.  She lived next to the Golf Course.
holy hell, i think that&#39;s the closest to a real life dinosaur anyone would ever get to see
Yeah Dave... Get inside it for perspective!😂
Is That Gator For Reals?
Jesus!  That thing is as big as a dinosaur.  A small dinosaur.   I&#39;d laugh if that &#39;gator made a break for Dave.  He wouldn&#39;t have a chance.
&quot;Don&#39;t mind me, just taking a walk&quot;
The Deinosuchus does not exist<br>Deinosuchus:

Dave, try to get a picture from inside it&#39;s stomach.
ain&#39;t no way bruh
Two impressive things in this video :<br>-The gator<br>-The most impressive talking helicopter impression I’ve ever seen
Never listen to a camera man who has everything to gain with the shot but nothing to lose they never die.
“mom can we watch jurassic park”<br>jurassic park at home:
Gators miss their golf playing bodies and days. Relax, if they wanted to eat you, they’d be right up your ass chasing you down the course
Sure its not an American or Nile Crocodile?
I’d shoot that thing. It shouldn’t exist
Honestly these guys were lucky that alligator was chillin. They must have been packing some serious freakin heat in their golf bags to be acting so cavalier about it because that alligator is freakin huge. If that alligator wanted them for dinner it would have lt. You wouldn&#39;t be able to out run it with it that close. Not one that big. I don&#39;t think they understood how fast a full grown alligator is. In and out of the water.
Dave get to it for perspective! Folks whaaaaaat ?😭
I tthought it was a dibasaur
Слабонервным просьба не смотреть 👀

SCP-682 is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin. It appears to be extremely intelligent and was observed to engage in complex communication with SCP-079 during their limited time of exposure. SCP-682 appears to have a hatred of all life, which has been expressed in several interviews during containment.<br><br>SCP-682 has always been observed to have extremely high strength, speed, and reflexes, though exact levels vary with its form. SCP-682&#39;s physical body grows and changes very quickly, growing or decreasing in size as it consumes or sheds material. SCP-682 gains energy from anything it ingests, organic or inorganic. SCP-682&#39;s regenerative capabilities and resilience are staggering, and SCP-682 has been seen moving and speaking with its body 87% destroyed.
Holy hell that’s a dinosaur

I wonder if gator is Trump golf course security hey madcow Rachel Maddow maybe gator will think your on his lunch menu hopping
Rise of the beasts speech spoiler lads!
That’s a dinosaur.
Its not a problem when humans play golf, when i do it however its a major problem
It&#39;s a strange feeling like watching a giant monster movie, but it&#39;s real-life and the giant monster exists in reality.
These animals are quite common in this region, which coincidentally is swampy. Some say they appear in the summer, so if you live in a Florida mansion, you might be surprised to see an alligator lounging in your pool or strolling through your grass.
That&#39;s the lanLORD of the golf course.
They&#39;re gonna need a bigger lake.
Bro just another day in Florida
Looks like an animatronic from Jurassic Park.

Good thing it&#39;s a Gator. Had that been a Croc, the appropriate response would have been, &quot;Kill the frak out of it right now.&quot;
a real life dinosaur!
Gator: wow what a beautiful Nature, i am so happy to walk and see these beautiful view.
Yeah Dave,get next to it!!🙄🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Im sick and tired of seeing things like<br>Hollywood CGs<br>Who said this is it
very deadly very terrible reminds me of the movie Jurassic Park
Is this guy talking into a fan ?
Imagine if it starts galloping
It probably been alive for a long long time
Lacost
As big as this one is, I&#39;ve seen one that was even bigger (and by a significant amount too).  A lot of people underestimate how huge American Alligators can grow.  It&#39;s rare to see them, but they are out there.
&quot;get next to it for perspective&quot; lmaoooo
He was just taking a walk across the golf course
Well the gator wasn&#39;t bothering anyone obviously
Backstory…. Dave had been a bit of an asshole earlier in the day. (The Farside come to life)

I think its at least 13 feet in lenth
Damn, I hit the ball right against the edge of the water, again!
So this came up as I was looking the difference between alligators and crocodiles, and according to my newfound surface level knowledge this is a crocodile : huge size, thick end of the tail, tan head and visible lower fourth teeth. An I wrong?
how long (in feet) is that alligator?

If there are any kids on that golf course I pray that their parents have enough foresight to keep a tight grip on their hands. With all of these shows these days depicting dinosaurs as our friends they might be inclined to go running up to it to pet it!
It&#39;s like a glimpse into Jurassic Park
fucking dinosaur is that croc still alive??.
That thing definitely was on its way to fight kong
ay is dat the red dead 2 alligator???

&quot;Dave, put your head inside gator&#39;s mouth for perspective&quot;
Dave, put your head inside gator&#39;s mouth for perspective
It&#39;s a dragon without wings
When Colombus reached the Coast of Florida, this Alligator was already there
Can you believe that 70 Million years ago, alligators used to be twice that size? Imagine seeing a 10 to 12 meter long croc such as Deinosuchus walking through a field. It really would have been a sight to behold.
It&#39;s a monster, no doubt, but somethings off with modern cell phone perspectives that tinkers with the distance/size gestalt.
That’s a good boy right there.
🎶You can&#39;t tell by the way I use my walk I&#39;m a woman&#39;s man🎶

Dino Gator. Probably fake.
Here I thought my cell phone was glitching.
Yeah... That&#39;s why we live in South Beach 😄😄<br>I have yet to see a giant alligator like that walk down Lincoln Road...<br>The rest of Florida is beautiful but there are too many encounters like these...<br>My wife is originally from Tampa and she once found an alligator standing up against the door of her apartment in a condo...
Alligator just wants to play some golf.
Holy macaroni!
This is why when my sister said &quot;come to Florida, it&#39;ll be fun&quot;, and suddenly &quot;No&quot; became an entire sentence for me.
The land that time forgot....
The Gator is taking a Stoll in his back yard.
It just ate a golfer.
Doesn&#39;t even look real
That ain’t no gator,that’s a dinosaur
Alien sees this, I would love to see it&#39;s reaction.
Basterebbe cambiare il campo da golf e lasciare i coccodrilli vivere in pace
Narrator to Dave: some of you may die, but it&#39;s a sacrifice I am willing to make.
Wow, the alligator was so big that it somehow added a helicopter effect to the cameraman’s voice. Incredible.
What do they eat? How could it hide for so long?
&quot;Get next to it for perceptive 😅&quot; <br>Yea, right 😂😂😂
Jaka fajna jaszczurka  !
Gator was just chilling have a nice walk and enjoying the lovely golf course. It may pop over to Dave for a lovely snack.
whats wrong with audio
C&#39;mon man,  you got golf clubs - go beat it to death!
Go infront of his mouth do a selfie 🤳. It will be cool.
That&#39;s the Del Lago from the Resident Evil 4 game!!
うあああ　巨大なワニがゴルフ場を練り歩いてる
it ate all the skinny golfers?  only the old fat ones left??
I think the gator was trying to figure out how far it was from one hole to the next.
Yeah, I would definitely let Sherman play through.  😀
Holy fuck
In the old JAWS movie,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         &quot;Foreground my ass&quot; is what Chief Brodie told Hooper when he asked him,                                                                                                     &quot;Could you go to the end of the pulpit please?

Like you know how pot roast smells if you leave it in the fridge or the crock pot to long.....so yeah, like a corpse&#39;s rotten anus just the worst shit you could imagine...on the green...just right there to left of the sand trap by hole 6. ⛳<br> A crock pot of sewage level rotted shiite. <br>Man I couldn&#39;t even imagine.

Average golf course in Florida:

Look closely you gullible assholes. Too many uniform and repetitive movements. Plus lighting does not match the scenery and the alligator is comically large. Grow some brains.

Cameraman shaking so much out of fear that even his voice is vibrating

The fact that the camera is so far away, yet the alagator is still this big, would of made me get away from this location ASAP, just in case this thing came with friends, and they&#39;re just lagging behind.

Wow , it&#39;s so big !!!!!
Fun fact... Alligators never stop growing, the only way most of them die is through poaching, starvation or physical damage. The only time gators die of old age is in captivity.

Glad I don’t live there those people who go there are crazy it’s either they remove those giant alligators or don’t go there at all they will kill you alive the only reason nobody got killed is cause they are slow they can’t run very fast and catch us
Why is everyone so shocked that he told Dave to get close to it? What were you expecting? Since when do robots have emotions?

It&#39;s real?
Good to see an alligator appreciate a game like golf
There’s no way this is real. It looks fake as hell. It’s walking way too consistent to be real.
Lol everyone came here for the giant gator but got actually shocked with the &quot;Dave, get next to it for perspective&quot;; what a true friend

Nowadays swag is common in Animal kingdom
So this is what my life has come to haan. Just laying around watching a gator walk at 1mph.
That wasn&#39;t a gator that was a T-Rex walking on all fours.
Just a crocodile the size of a dinosaur crawling across a golf course.....no problem!

Don&#39;t be panic man!<br>I need vitamin D. 😂
Must be nice to be able to waste hundreds of dollars a week on something as dumb as this. The rest of America has to work their asses off, always one check away from tossed out of house and home and these schmucks throw money away on a long walk they could take for free at their local park. Jokes on them. 🤣
What&#39;s with the choppy ass audio?
I would not want a enemy if i have Dave&#39;s friend
If my friend asked me to get closer he would get my perspective alright.

Dynasaurs now a days barely go out for shopping.

Is it normal for these types of living dinosaurs to walk by as if nothing had happened? or is it the golf &quot;park&quot; mascot?

He want to learn Golf... That&#39;s the Main reason....
There is no God except Allah, prophet Muhammad is the messenger of Allah ❤️🌸<br>Jesus (Peace be upon him) never said that he is God, the Quran says:<br><br>And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, “O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, ‘Take me and my mother as deities besidesAllah ?&#39;” He will say, “Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen. 117. I said not to them except what You commanded me – to worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness. 118. If You should punish them – indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them – indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. (Holy Quran 5:116-118) .
Just what the hell does that gator eat near a golf course to get that big?!
He is very huge
This is the closest we&#39;ve got to a dinosaur.
The draconians wanted to enslave humans feeding off their pain/negative energy n created the reptilians a bit larger than this, killed the dinosaurs to replace them and reign over mankind. I myself had one in my house trying to attack me but I saw many coming off the water in a Tsunami video and weirdly nobody else saw but one person saw 1. They get denser under very painful happenings such as war, floods, where there&#39;s death n destruction. They&#39;re humanoid so longer paws than this. Literally I know them and I&#39;m mindblown most ppl don&#39;t see what&#39;s in front of their eyes. It&#39;s tough to see human kind living poorly because who knows the truth gets ignored and they continue being ruled by these bad guys :(
Just another normal day in Florida
Dave&#39;s friend just wanted to win the game of golf.
The real Land owner is inspecting his property..

Put a saddle on that and go for a wild ride.
