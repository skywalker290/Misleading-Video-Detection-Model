$100 the camera dude was friends with the smasher…they seen the car coming down the road and started filming…who the fuck films a line of people when Lamborghini drives by?  I might be wrong but probably not haha
If you almost hit someone, accidents happen. But if you roll through a stop sign and honk as if the kid is at fault, you deserve to have your window smashed up. He has a very expensive car so he has the money to get it fixed. People like this like to show off.
Now I’m really mad
I hate that kid who break that mclaren
I want a tint meter on that car pronto 😂😂
Si c&#39;est comme en France, la ligne blanche du stop doit être marqué
Y&#39;avait un stop juste avant.
Lets be honest,it dont matter if the dude with the car was right,yall will still be hatin.
Idk why but to me he looks like Mike wolfe
nice cars never stop at stop signs
Insurance will pay for it hopefully
That kid got in trouble
Camera man was filming signage 🤣🤣
That was the most delayed Worldstar ever😂
Well he didn&#39;t stop like he was suppose to so that&#39;s on driver. U run a stop sign n got the nerve to honk
Continue continue
Continue
Bro kid got his ass beaten
NOT DA MP4
Well he didn’t stop at the stop sign
You had one job
Didn’t he blow that stop sign tho….
I hope this kid pays the full amount for repair.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9NLzlSaU4Qk">https://youtube.com/shorts/9NLzlSaU4Qk?si=btNjMQo0sygvpFlB</a><br><br>Luckily this was recorded by somebody who actually knows how to film something.
He can afford a really nice car but doesnt even get the idea of Zebra/Pedestrian crossings. If you honk at somebody uaing the crossing yeah it&#39;s gonna piss them off.
Smash and run
Bet he got the kicking of his life
Dude ran the stop sign, f him.
Most overrated car brand ever
Id be driveing after the kid not just sitting there looking at it
Oooooooooooo😅
L bozos that’s what you get for showing off to the poor telling people to get off your streets even though you don’t own them 😂😂
we gonna talk about the stop sign ?
deserved
Even if the driver was wrong, it’s illegal to destroy someone’s property. If the skateboarder thinks he was in the right, why start running.
Damn that stop sign looking real nice unblocked by any branches or tall bushes.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kid 1: 0 Lamborghini
This is exactly what you should do before you drive off tell the person who’s clearly recording you that you’re on your way to murder a teenager
That’s a true friend- willing to chase down a kid for you
HAHAHA well if ur dick wasnt so small you wouldnt need some neon sports car now would you? buy something cheaper mr big daddy
The other kid got knock I seen it
So were all ok that he ran a stop sign and almost hit the skater
any update?
Stop sign: Karma is a BITCH...
I believe that’s justified h**ecide! Just saying
Skate jerk boy should have walked the CROSS WALK and should fight instead of hit n run. Young stupid jerk.
ja
shouldn&#39;t have beeped at em
Kids gonna die tonight
I&#39;m sorry to say this. But attention seekers deserve this
If I was in there I would steal the car and sell it
What in the actual f have I just witnessed<br>Someone broke his windshield and run for no reason, the camera man missed everything, and that guy just left his friend? Wtf
Yes yes yes
The kid after that:🤕
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7yt-VPYtOA">0:00</a>
He probably almost ran him over
카메라 렌즈는 그의 눈
What took his ass so long to close the door and drive after them???
Whoop his ass
Yeah the colour was awful
This is why nobody can have nice things
Did the car miss the stop sign and the kid was on the crosswalk?
Driver needs to learn how to stop at stop signs. 😂
For anyone who didn&#39;t know, this was staged, the car already had a small crack on the windshield and it had to be fully replaced. So they did this as a joke, dude that started chasing the other guy wasn&#39;t in on it and actually started chasing the dude for real if I remember correctly.
was the window already cracked/chipped and instead of being repaired they had the brilliant idea of staging this then getting window fixed that needed it anyways?
Yeah well he&#39;s dead tonight
That kid is now on the missing persons list
dude tried to run after the kid u aint catchin him 😂😂 learn what a crosswalk is and u wouldn&#39;t get ur shit caved in
$20000
Sounds like the skater learned a lesson the hard way.
Crap colour 😂
That kid would be laying in a pool of his own blood
Never saw so many lawyers in a comment section before
Was bro that jealous
Good kid what do you expect when you nearly run him over
Bro turned into the flash
How are people saying this is fake? I don&#39;t really see it
Well, did he catch him?
Giving skateboarders a bad name I don’t like that however, the guys seemed like a jack ass honking at the kid on the skateboard in his 200,000 dollar Mclaren… skaters don’t play that shit bru you found out the hard way… btw you ain’t catching him we run from cops and property owners on the regular… lmao
250k car? Nah they go for 125k
If anyone wants to know the update. Kid and his family got sued for A$500,000 and had to pay it. The kid is actually in jail, you can look him up under Sydney’s prison list . His name is (you thought this was real)
Bro Andrew f**king Tate came out that car
🤣🤣🤣🤣
That’s a McLaren 12c there’s no way it costs 250k
Well deserved you don’t run a stop sign idiot
At that time, you follow the devil to his house, ring the bell and calmly explain what happened to the person in charge of the rogue
Car literally ran the stop sign 😂
The car didn’t stop at the stop sign and almost hit dude on the skateboard.
R.I.P to that car and the guy
bro really left him
Would of beat that kids ass like a red headed step child lmao
Cameraman had one job
Kid was crossing, guy honked, screw that guy, screw your car too lol
I&#39;m surprised nobody stole that car
This video surfaced about 5 years ago and it shows the skater hitting the lambo idk why this one is cut off
Bystander: “Sorry Bud” <br><br>Me: Pulls out Glock 9<br><br>Bystander: WOAH! BRO!<br><br>Me: Don’t ever say “Sorry Bud.”<br><br>Me: That makes me think you apart of it.
This stakeboard kid is a legend for this
That kid slipped on a  banana pill and his mom paid $200 000 for the boy&#39;s broken teeth and $7 dollars for the wind shield 😬
i would just get in the car and overrev it and runs away but thats just me.
Dude needs a severe beating
&quot;Mors Mutual, how can we help?&quot;
I hope.he get caught and get hus ass kicked do bad
Camera guy was totally involved and this looked planned
Learn how to fucking drive then 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Welp l guess that&#39;s what you call automatic reflex in life-threatening situations he is so far past that stop sign it wasn&#39;t even funny
Why do these videos never catch the good shit
The camera man fucking sucks, had he angled the camera slightly to the right we could have seen the moment of impact. Absolute fruit cake
F*<b>***</b> a*<b>***</b>
People that own cars like that, have access to assassination money.
Don’t worry, they can’t afford this anyway
Stupid kid..stupid parent.
I don’t give a fuck if it’s me or someone else. You honk at me or someone else while running a stop sign, I will ding your shit. If you then wanna step outa your car, I will rock your shit.
There would be slow singing and flower singing if that was my car. People needs to learn to respect people&#39;s property.
You had 1 job
The kid did right, you can&#39;t honk your horn at someone in the cross walk. Kudos to the kid
That kid is a big nerd
L camera man, bro missed the actual impact
yeahhh FUCK THAT EXPENSIVE CARS
“Sorry bud” 🤡
this is actually fake yes
Runs stop sign and almost hits pedestrian. Nah I&#39;d say he earned it.
That kind of money damn thing should be able to fall 1000 feet and not get a scratch on it. Let alone be damaged by a skateboard.
Camera man had one fucking job 🤦🏽‍♂️
Deserved, prick driver deserves prick treatment
VRO THAT COST 25-50K
Nice
Bro. The windshield was aiready broken
This bad kid never get good luck
I love how I heard “world star” at the end
W skater fool got a nice car thinks he owns the street not stopping
Fck skaters
Who cares windshields are probably the cheapest thing on a super car to replace. If he wanted to really fuck his day up hed aim for where 3 body panels touch and try and damage all 3
Skaters always running away.
If I caught somebody damaging my car they would be paying for it not only financially but physically too.
That kid did good job lol
lol why that Lamborghini car stopped that&#39;s why kid attack
Worldstar. Lol
Dude totally ran through a stop sign.
This douchebag ran a stop sign and almost hit the person on the skateboard.
&quot;Get out my ride side*<br><b>broke</b><br>THAT COST ME 10000$ BITCH<br>YOU WILL PAY ME MONEY!!!
“Sorry bud” HIS ENTIRE WINDSCREEN JUST GOT SMASHED
I like skating but i didnt get into It that much because of the toxic community like this
Flexing gone wrong 😆
And then that guy sold the kid in black market to repair the windshield
Hate how people pussy off after doing shit like that like dude don’t be a pussy stay and stand your ground
That kids subway surfers talent
When two a**holes collide.  Nobody to cheer for here.
The worst thing is that the co-pilot caught the boy and forced him to pay a repair of 5k dollars
My gut prob went to los santos customs
Good news: the kid brutally died when he is skateboarding a truck running off him
He can afford a replacement
Bruhhh aint no way he getting off easy
Why tf would his ass do that? Hating ass people I swear
Entitles fucker didn&#39;t stop at the stop sign
Camera work is trash
Well he did roll through the stop sight and crosswalk and had the nerve to honk at him.  Still not cool.
Shoulda stopped at the stop sign dickhead
It’s fake
Maybe he well never dtop in the crosswalk again
Good shit😉👌
I hope that kid gi get a life
bro honked at a pedestrian crossing first, what did he think would happen
THAT&#39;S COMING OUT OF YOUR ACCOUT SKATEBOARD KID! 😠
It’s literally just a windshield prolly some dumb expensive glass cuz it’s foreign no way it’s more then 2k$ tho
I Just can Imagine That the dude who got out of the car fighted him
Kids these days have no respect oh my god. What a stupid child , that&#39;s gonna cost thousands to patch up!
The dipshit driving the (stupidly expensive) car ran the stop sign, presumably almost hitting the skateboarder and got what he deserved. Maybe he should have spent that money on glasses to see the stop sign better.
You&#39;re rude teenager why do you ruin the rich man MP4 12C
Other side of the building killing that poor kid😂
I mean the lambo should have stopped at the stop sign if he would&#39;ve he wouldn&#39;t have almost hit the skateboarder and none of this would have happened
All I see is a bunch of people getting mad at the McLaren driver, probably because he&#39;s successful. The skater broke a 250000 dollar cars WINDSHIELD the fact that your standing up for makings no goddamn sense to me.
“jake was never seen again”
“World star”
I love how he recorded before it happend
I love how he left him
Failed to stop and the kid was in the crosswalk
Should have stopped at the stop sign 🤷🏼‍♀️
We all know that the guy who threw the rock is a jealous piece of shit
I hope he had a dashcam😩😩😭😭🥺🥺
I hope that skater kid is all right
Not the kids fault the guy never stopped at the stop sign
I was walking across the street crosswalk light on and a dude in a super nice car, way better looking then this one  just drove through the crosswalk I had to take a step back so I kicked a huge dent in his car and I&#39;ll do it again haha
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Should’ve stolen the car
Don&#39;t run a stop sign lol lesson learned
Hey look another dick in a expensive car not stopping at stop signs
This was staged… The guy that uploaded it already admitted it was staged. The windshield was already broken and it was due to be changed and they thought they could have a little fun by staging the whole thing
I wouldn’t drive an exotic car with a guy next to me.
Cost to raise child to cost middle-class family $286,000 in 2022 (excluding college )<br><br>Super car Windshield Replacement Cost $1600 to $6000 respectively.<br><br>failing to stop at a stop sign is $238 plus any other costs and fees.Jan 15, 2020 <br><br>Anger Management The 6-week course is $175, and the 16-week course is $275
Well maybe he shoulda stopped at that big ole stop sign and that skater wouldn’t be angry you almost pulled out in front of him
whenever you see this kind of long que will you get into the end of the que without knowing nothing what is this que for?
Thoroughly embarrassed
Btw your cars orange that tells me a lot about your manhood lol I’m sorry I just get the sense that guy is a cocky prick and had it coming.
You can hear the car slam it’s breaks because he went through the stop sign and almost hit the kid. So the kid was like F you dork and made him into a laughing stock.
Yo imagine how bad that kid got messed up. He kinda deserved it tho
The kid died
Maybe next time dont run the stopsign
He ran the stop sign fuck it.
I mean if I saw something going down, I would probably forget my name and just look on. So don’t blame the camera guy for missing the moment
Legend has it that that kid is still being chased by that man.
It would be beautiful if the crowd had joined in on the demolition of the overpriced entitlement badge.
How awesome would it have been if someone drove off with his car xD insurance won’t cover that!!
That’s what the rich guy gets because there’s a dumb ass stop sign he didn’t stop he kept on going
Hilarious
When cars dont stop at stop signs.... accidents happen!
This video are staged
But wait didn’t the guy run the stop sign and almost hit him ?I’ll be mad that you almost hit me but I’m not going to go damage your vehicle
He shouldve stopped at the stop sign the skater is a pedestrian he has right of way juss cuz u got a nice car u cant just disobey the traffic laws! That was a lil extreme but shid dont be a douchebag us skaters cant skate in the sidewalk anyway so we gotta ride in the street so fuck lamoguy also the cameraman sucks
Ohh
He passed the stop sign and the walk line so yeah f*** it get what you deserve Mr Lamborghini man
Hahahahaha 100% deserved hope the guy that ran after him got smacked with the skateboard as hard as the windshield did
Deserved. The car drove up and stopped past the stop sign. He failed to stop correctly and put pedestrians walking through the crosswalk in danger.
Bro ran a stop sign and had the audacity to honk the horn like he was the idiot?
the lambo should of stopped at the stop sign and not have honked. But smashing the glass was kinda stupid
cameraman was obvious video taping girls... just sayin.
As a usual pedestrian I don’t feel sorry for the car at all
achievement unlocked: assert dominance
For the PPL who are curious it&#39;s all staged
All I know is, there’s a stop sign that didn’t get obeyed. Camera dude there like he forgot he had a camera but... the stop sign my guy
Mf ran a stop sign wtf
idc if i get charged but i’d definitely leave that kid with a bloody swollen face
Stupid kid is gonna pay for that window
If I was the driver i would have broken that kids bones
Clearly ran a stop sign.
Maybe the lambo almost hit the guy or the guy got in front on purpose either way to smash it
He deserves that fo sho he should have stoped at the line he dosent have a right away, expensive car dosent equal able to break road laws 🤷‍♂️
Time to commit war crime
Rip his car 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The car was definitely in the wrong. Didn’t stop at the cross walk line Probably almost hit the skateboarder that’s why he broke his windshield. And the guy holding him like he was wrong I would’ve done the same thing
How about stop at the damn stop line instead of pulling up and parking on top of the crosswalk then continue to honk at dude as if he did something wrong when he was already crossing. 🎈
I mean he passed a stop sign into the crosswalk
Jokes aside , the smashing sound was perfect 👌
RUN BROTHER, RUN!!
They didn’t even stop at the sign lmao
Mad respect 4 the kid
Hello that is horrible
Don’t run stop signs then.
“World star”
If you vote for me I will make it law to shot skateboarders and bikers especially the ones who think they own the road on site, their family will also be publicly executed for raising drug addicts.
how you pull up in a mcclaren runnin the stop sign blow ur horn cuz you almost hit the pedestrian in which the stop sign is there to PREVENT. then when the pedestrian gets mad and retaleates ur now upset?
Camera man: that’s a nice sunset I think I should keep filming it
Holy shit reading these comments makes me lose all faith in humanity. We are doomed.
&quot;I got a crack in my windshield in a normal way....better lie and turn it into content&quot;
Don&#39;t no if it the drive farght or the kid farght
Should have hit the hood as hard as he could, way more expensive to fix
😂
He did drive into the pedestrian lane. as a skater I&#39;ve almost been killed multiple times from Jack arses not stopping before the lines, but the broken windshield was uncalled for. In the US skaters are legally considered pedestrians . So think twice before trying to run them off side walks or drive into them
Dude finna GET IT when he gets caught by the guy chasing 😂
Amazing camera work
And that’s why you stop at stop signs.
So the guy ran the stop sign and must’ve almost hit the skater or something
the guy who said world star at the end 💀
If you don’t believe me I can run like the wind blows and that day I was running🏃 Run Forest Run!!!!
Did you guys catch the kid
The car is around 100k
Did he just say “now we gotta go kill him” 😭😂
Why’s nobody talking about how the driver didn’t stop at the “STOP SIGN” and clearly almost this the kid skateboarding. That dude should be lucky he didn’t get his head smash with the trucks on the skateboard.
The idiot ran a stop sign
When you ack your friend to record and this is what you get
So we aren&#39;t going to talk about how the car almost hit the dude just the fact that he retaliated. Be a better f*<b>***</b> driver and people wouldn&#39;t act like that
We do a little bit of trolling
Are we not gonna talk about how super car dude deserved it
Skate culture disownes this bitxh
The caught the kid later that day hiding in a septic tank <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjUgz5FHR90">https://youtu.be/LjUgz5FHR90</a>
Lol everyone starting a war about this when the driver and the person filming in 2016 confirmed this was all staged for fun lmao
This is why skateboarders get a bad name in some places
Well man ran over the stop so cant blame the kid to get mad over it
That car hit that kid..
Emotional damage
They can afford the repair don&#39;t worry
Pulls up and all cool points went right out the window
Kid:break rich boi car glass<br>Everyone:stop talking about the kid film the glass for tictok
Mclaren owner Should&#39;ve yelled &quot;500 bucks to whoever catches that jackass!!&quot; and he would be caught in like fruit fly time
nice
Um….
The guy shouldn&#39;t have honked at him I would have done the same thing that kid on the skateboard have respect for pedestrians also the guy didn&#39;t even stop at the stop sign
Shouldn’t have ran the stop sign
Listen to all these ass kissers. Those scumbags deserved more than a busted windshield.
I wonder if the skater got his ass beat
Son of a bitch better be glad that wasn’t my car Bc I would’ve jumped have jumped up and shot him up but at least I would’ve been smart enough stopped at that stop sign but then again LA is the most upbringing city in America and is notorious for breaking the traffic laws and other serious laws
Skateboard kid these days are really coward. There is another video where a guy got struck from behind by a skateboarding kid and the kid run away. Bunch of little piece of trash ruining other people lives
The driver just ignored the stops sign.
The driver hit a pedestrian and wonders why he smashed his windshield. Fucking prick.
Maybe the car should have stopped ✋ 🤔  clearly a stop sign
Bet he won’t honk again 😂
Sorry for what? He&#39;s the dip shit who nearly ran the kid over on a crossing
I love how the other guy just drove away :,)
Stupid camera man was recording the road😪
Don’t lie, that’s every skaters dream
That’s why you make a full stop at a stop sign bro
The driver felt like crying 😂😂
Why you running bro. Wanna act tough then run away. Lmao
SHEEEEEEEEEESH!!!!!!
Well that just happened..
I was the car up the street and seen it all sad day for us 🚗
Wtf
Thats a lot of damage
That kid is a bad kid man
I&#39;m pretty sure that 12C-MP4s costs 70-100K
Don&#39;t worry about that stop sign. He got what he deserved lmao
Ouch that hurts!!
Camera man👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯
next on record well my guy...
Who’s the guy inside the car ?
Car didn’t stop at stop sign and almost hit a pedestrian that was a minor . Kid was in the write by protecting him self no?
Wonder if the guy chasing the kid ever caught up to him?
He deserves it anyway
Didn’t the skater try crossing the road and the bloke in the car just kept driving nearly hitting him or some shit?
Nice Camara
Not a McClaren, any other car would’ve cool
Rich dont make u run faster m8
killua becomes real
I mean as a skater when a dude with a douchebag profile car pulls up after not stopping at stop sign and a crosswalk id prob smash it as well!
Skaters rly think they own the road and are the shit
Eat the rich
Beat his —-
Gotta love these tiktok edits. You can never see anything going on but you&#39;ll still give it 312k likes 😂
Why did he smash it wtf has probably jealous
Well stop when you’re suppose to stop douchefuckingnozzle. Hand clap for the kid on the skateboard!
Legend says he is still chasing that kid
Love to see it
I hate that kid
That&#39;s.....thaaaattss......😮
Cocksuckers need a McLaren to get women.
beat ... the .... sh*t .... out .... of ..... that ..... kid .... idgaf about parents after this kinda thing
She&#39;s a runner she&#39;s a track star
Kids nowadays
Why tf would that kid even do that??
The car had a stop but didn’t stop? 🤥
Five seconds later you hear rapid gunfire
Looks like he ran a stop sign and deserved a broken windshield, good work sk8 gang.
Good for that kid pedestrians have the right-of-way anyways.
Man, that kid would be dead if that was my car
dude thats a mclaren mp4 12c
And skaters wonder where the BAD reputation comes from, <br>List of charges, vandalism, fleeing the scene of an accident. Attempt manslaughter throwing or hitting a car windshield with intent to inflict bodily harm, <br>Stupid skater could get 10-15 years for his IGNORAMUS ACTIONS
Oh, I’m sure he can afford to have it fixed. 🤷‍♀️ It’s called insurance. 👌
Lesson: dont be a douchebag with ur fancy car
Another kidney gone 😂😂😂😂
Fatherless homes….
I love the part where you actually see the kid hitting the glass..........ohh........well that is not there
The kid is clearly the main character of something, we will hear about him in some years
The driver didn’t pay attention to:<br>1- Stop sign 🛑 <br>2- Crosswalk
Holly crap
I bet that&#39;s again just one of those kids who thinks that that&#39;d be funny for the by-passers
U suck at filming jk
Legend says he is running til this day
Nah fuck this dude, kid shoulda posted up and truck fucked the dumbass who got out. Just cause you drive some overpriced piece of shit doesn’t meant you’re entitled to more of the road or to blow past stop signs into a crosswalk.
I hope the kid got caught.
maybe stop at the stop sign
That is NOT that much
maybe obey a stop sign and crosswalk and don&#39;t honk at pedestrians like an entitled pos and that wouldn&#39;t have happened :)
Haha thats wht you get dickhead
This is why we film horizontally
If you can afford a lambo then why is replacing a windshield such a big issue
Here is the good one https://youtube.com/shorts/GEki9SWckuo?feature=share
Good. The kid was reminding him theres a fucking stop sign.
250k mate you can get on for less than 100k 150k max for prestige condition
Yo that kid is dead💀
Driver: Let me get mad and indignant at the person I should have stopped for, and honk, because it&#39;s his fault I run stop signs.<br><br>I disagree with the kids reaction and the outcome, but have zero empathy about the windshield damage.
That car aint that much rn, try like 60
The chaser is in good shape, hope sk8tr boy doesn&#39;t get beat up too bad as the driver will catch him on the other side of the block....
I would have made it very hard for the parents. Made sure that he got the same amount of ass whippings for the price of the window.
250 gran? In the UK you can get MP4’s for peanuts!
Le stop il le fait quand ????
I hope they beet the kid
I like how people supporting the kid for smashing the windscreen because he didn&#39;t stop at a stop sign. Apparently its okay to break stuff if u dont follow rules.
Poser kid?
Just because u drive a quarter mill car dosnt mean u can drive over sombody at a crossing fair play kid
Never understood why someone would spend that much money on a car. When a car is nothing but a liability. Also you become a even bigger target for theives and vandals. 🤷🏾‍♂️
That’s honestly what he gets people think they can just disobey traffic laws and signs without consequences just cause they have a flashy car and the crowd is totally brain dead for thinking the guy in the car was in the right imagine that kid got ran over by him what then is the crowd still gonna agree with the flashy car don’t thinks so
RUN FORREST, RUUUNNNNN!!!!!
Idk if its an accident or on porpuse
Well the driver clearly doesn&#39;t know how crosswalks work.
Kid is going around on a skateboard, and dude is getting driven in an Audi R8 (I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s an Audi). I don&#39;t think Usain Bolt is going to catch him
Fake or not, the guy in the car definitely deserved that because he didn&#39;t even stop behind the stop sign, LIKE YOU&#39;RE SUPPOSED TOO. He stopped IN FRONT of the stop sign, so very well deserved :D
He got his shit smashed because he thinks he&#39;s too rich for stop signs.
Why do people do stuff like that
Poor supercar owner hope he replaced the windshield with another one.
HOW TO lean NPC out of the Car
Oh that&#39;s so bad feel bad for the Guy 😭😭
Finally honking for no reason gets karma
good job kid
The car ran a stop sign The kid had every right to enter the crossword there was no need for him to hunk
😂😂🤣🤣
Sucked in
Camera man really liked recording that stop sign
That guy is like dafaq
Why tf are people even liking this.... it&#39;s such a fucking  asshole. Like dude come on don&#39;t fucking destroy someone else his/her stuff without a freaking reason. Thats not nice
Won&#39;t be hard to get him normally you skate around where you live in small ten like this
Good thing to see an asshole driving a fucking polluting car getting his windshield smashed
I dont know why everyone is mad at the skateboard guy, this is the best revenge ever. Expensive car guy thinks that hes so cool that he can just ignore all road regulations, almost hits a guy, and then gets served a fat plate of justice
F
That fucker i hope they catch him and put him in jail and make him pay for repair.
I liked the part where I saw a guy smashing a windshield
Douche driver
Well now he&#39;s gonna pay for that windshield with all of his money and stuff.
Mclaren 12c
Yra but he didnt stop at stop sign
The one dude that said worldstar at the end lmfao
Kid got lucky they didn’t chase him with the car
Good on the kid, car should stopped at the stop sign.  Teach the rich prick who thinks he&#39;s above the law
Bro he left his freind
Ignored Stop sign, got windshield smashed, continued to  drive with high speed in the city...<br><br>Deserved..? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Is it done on purpose or is it an accident
Reasons why i hate children
If this happens in Egypt, everyone on the street will chase after him
What I think happened.<br>The car was driving down the road, kid rides out into the middle on his skateboard without looking. Car has to slam his brakes, dumbass kid somehow takes it like it wasn&#39;t his own fault he just rode out into the middle without looking for cars, and puts his board thru the window.
Idc it was satisfying watching a rich douche get his little toy broken.
Hell yeah , fuck the rich!
If the car was mine i would be so pissed
This is fake it’s proven by a big YouTuber
I love watching rich people&#39;s belongings get f&#39;ed up. Great vid 👍
Well,  if you run a crossing and nearly hit the pedestrian you deserve evething that&#39;s coming to you. Well done that guy.
Just a young punk
The rich asshole in the car prolly deserved it, not because he has an expensive car or money but because most rich people are assholes
The car had a fall
🤯🤯
why?😭
world star…
Quick question how did you know this was gonna happen?<br><b>The Rock has raised an eyebrow</b> 🤨
That Driver of McLaren MP4 be like: Oops wrong neighborhood , Adios xD
I love how the driver just leaves the guy chasing the skateboarder going to the opposite direction
That skateboard is going to be shoved somewhere after that. What a little shithead.
IM SORRY BUT WHEN HE FILMED THE DRIVER FR A SPLIT SEC IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS DEAD 😂😂😂😂🤣
Camera man sucks
The random guy to say sorry would piss me off lol
Kill
He ran a stop sign and almost hit that kid.
Dude started chasing the boy faster than the kid took to hit the window after the car stopped… feels like a non justifiable hit and run. Especially after the kid bolted full speed after hitting the window. Just pure stupidity
Loved the part when the driver totally ignored the stop sign.  &quot;Sorry bud&quot; 😁😁
that’s too bas
It is 100k max
Exactly why I’m not a E boy Emo skater try hard gang boy
I hope he catched the kid.
He didn’t even stop at the stop sign 🛑
I would have catched that kid and took all his cloths including his skateboard and would&#39;ve knocked him out too lol
Ran the stop sign
Mmmm the kids is makes big mistake mclaren is piece of art soo why he broke the front windshield
The guy ran a stop sign, probably almost hit the kid
That kid got speed damn
Beautiful car...
He’ll be ok. Probably the first hardship he’s ever faced.
307k likes... Clearly shows, that society loves to see the successful fall..
this is why you never buy not cheap car
The kid and the driver are both in the wrong.
What happens when you about run somebody over because you can’t stop at a stop sign properly
I think that man who driving the car may hit him so he takes revenge 😅😂
But why he did this
Satisfaction right there.
Shouldn’t run stop signs and cross walks.
I would’ve ended that kids life 🤦🏽‍♂️
Honestly well done those stupid retarded bastards think that if they drive expensive cars they are allowed to not stop at stops...
That&#39;s not a 250k car bud😂
Dear American friends  those white strips means pedestrian line  you are obligated to stop till the line is cleared so the kid reaction was right it is called self defense I give the same reaction couple years ago in Atlanta Airport the guy almost run me over with Audi q7 I broke his left headlight with a kick my American friend told me watch out for cars in USA cause most of the Americans don&#39;t know the traffic laws and getting driver license in ATL cost $25 anybody can get it less then a 25 minutes
Bruh I hop that kid pays
This kid is the reason why there are washable and untoxic markers
F his mclaren. Tbey all sound like douches.
bruh im pretty sure thats not 250k, thats more like 130-180k
I love the silent &quot;World star&quot; in the background
The guy deserved it. He wasn&#39;t paying attention and probably almost hit the kid and then honked at him like that was kid was in the wrong meanwhile the driver didn&#39;t even see the STOP SIGN! One of the person from the crowd clearly says &quot;because the guy didn&#39;t stop&quot;. <br><br>Just because you have an expensive car doesn&#39;t mean you are entitled to everyone&#39;s respect. You have to first give the respect and obey the laws in order to get respect back.
Any update on what happened to the kid?
Bruh the guy didn&#39;t stop at the stop line but that smack wasn&#39;t called for maybe he could of reported him and the dude paid sum but damn too far
Maybe he should have stopped at the stop sign. No sympathy for that prick. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Why would you do that. Just pure jealousy
I feel bad to his car got smash in the windshield
Do you stop douchebag. And dont horn at people.
zebra crossing?
It’s a McLaren…
Kkkkkk amazing sk8
Don&#39;t blame the kid at all...I would have did the same...but I wouldn&#39;t have ran...it&#39;s go time
Seems the windshield was defective anyways. It must have made the stop sign invisible, props to the kid for helping the guy notice.
I want a part 2
skateboard kid’s prob dead by now
The mclaren is not worth $250k.. it’s worth $87-100k for a 12c
Kids are so stupid. They are the future of America and that is really sad. They don&#39;t know how to respect their elders.
Lambo driver deserves his glass smashed ... From the sounds of it he rolled threw the stop sign as the kid was crossing the cross walk ... almost hitting said kid and had the nerves to honk at the kid for being in the way ... When Infact mr.lambo was in the way ..
Fuck this fucking video lmao, what was he even looking at 😔
Its a fake and staged video
Don&#39;t be a douchebag
Well he didn&#39;t stop at the line and drove into the crosswalk.... sooooooo yea IMO he deserved it
Plot twist : that kid was a gang member and his buddy holding the cam  just stole that car
That must be karen&#39;s child..
Kid got beat up 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣👌
POV: he left his buddy pursuiting the kid who broke the car&#39;s windshield
It seems that a lot of people don’t understand that a lot of cops and judges take the pedestrians side in situations like these
And that&#39;s why you need a bulletproof windshield
Imagine if it was a F1 instead of 12c ;-;
He can afford it
Good fuck those pos them spoiled people with daddy&#39;s money
did the kid ever get caught?
Scripted bs. Nothing more nothing less
I mean it is a pedestrian crossing/stop sign the car had to give way to him however it doesn&#39;t give the kid the right to smash a windscreen and would have been better if he just confronted him
Finally,a close up video
Godspeed, kid.
Poors angry
Mechanic: What&#39;s wrong with her now?
Wasn’t this already proven to be faked years ago?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I used to beat up skaters in high school
Fuck that wack ass shitty sports car
Hahahah!  Good.  What a POS. Rolling through a stop sign then honking at someone in the cross walk. Fuk these rich entitled pricks
Sorry bud 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 now gtfooh lmao
The driver of the car deserves it to me. He roles past the stop sign and blocks the walk way. Probably came close to hitting the kid. I&#39;m happy the kid did what he did. Need more if this
Freaking teenagers amirite
周围没一个人帮忙 丑国
why running to chase the guy should use the car to block him
stupid jealous people always so mean with these supercars, these guys worked hard for it (most of them)
Serves him right.. for not stopping at a stop sign .. super car doesn’t give you privilege.
Woooooorld star
Smh 😭
Cowardly punk needs a big cup of whoop-ass !
That dude probably didn’t stop to let the kid on the board cross because he’s a fucking tool. If so it’s instant karma
that&#39;s why you shouldn&#39;t flex Infront kids
Zebra crossing, should have stopped fk face
That kid is dead
That kid is gonna get his stakeboard shoved right him lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7yt-VPYtOA&amp;t=1">0:01</a>
It’s an MP 12, it’s like the new gen 1 R8, prices vary from 80k-120k.
This is what we do when you want to lure someone to a location and then execute/mug them
That’s a real skater
The real cameraman will run and chase the guy so we can have maximum entertainment
Like, why!
Oh well the Guy almost hit him because he blew the stop sign... I don&#39;t blame the kid. He could be dead. Or crippled for life.
That&#39;s what he gets for not stopping behind the pedestrian lane. He didn&#39;t even make a  full stop. Look at the stop sign. He just kept going.
The filming is truly stellar
Who parks on a crosswalk?
Staged
This is proof that many people don&#39;t understand the value of money.
Legend has it that kid is still running today<br>Honestly dude deserved a broken windshield though, went right through a stop sign. Play stupid games win stupid prizes<br>It&#39;s like people constantly forget that cars are two ton killing machines.
I hope that kid did jail time
The kid had the right of way the driver didn’t also drove PAST the stop sign not at it
Ha
everyone in this video must be retarded.
Honestly deserved it didn&#39;t stop at the stop sign and honked his horn like he wasn&#39;t in the wrong.
That driver got what he deserved, he ran the stop sign and then honks at the kid in the crosswalk he almost ran over.
Deserved
Good for the kid. Fucker ran the stop sign.
He didn&#39;t stop at the stop sign. Don&#39;t drive like an A-hole .
He ran the fucking stop. Fuck him. He feels privileged and entitled
Kid did not think that thru. Ik its just glass but I feel like he cannot afford a windscreen to a Mclaren
This video is so repetitive. Isn&#39;t there anything new to film?
Broooo it was a rental
To be fair though, he didn&#39;t do his stop... Consequences..
McLaren 12c
The guy in the vehicle didn’t even stop at the stop sign so he definitely deserved it.
Maybe the car should have stopped at the stop sign.
Carglass répare, carglass remplace
Well done Gonzo you fooled alot of us. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQHkO1XY_g">https://youtu.be/0iQHkO1XY_g</a>
The amount of jealous people on the comment section defending the douche skater is making me lose my hope in humanity
Lol white kids acting like black kids what a turn if events
Skateboard Chad vs virgin lambo
The question that won&#39;t be silenced: Where are the boy and the guy who was chasing him? 🤔
&quot;Hey do you know how to hold a camera?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lol no&quot;<br><br>&quot;Great you&#39;re hired.&quot;
All nonchalant at the end “worldstar”
I hope that kid learned his lesson
Rumor has it that they’re both still running.
Its fake, channel 9 Denver CO did a story on it. Yall should YouTube it. Its actually a good segment
This has to be fake because the camera man did not show us the car&#39;s windshield being smashed.
Looked like the driver was going to ignore the stop and hit the kid
RIP
Nooooo, not the McLarry
Its the Mclarens fault with the boy. The Mclaren didn&#39;t stop at the stop sign, and should have made sure there&#39;s no pedestrians. The boy had no right to smash the window. And he was skating on a crossing. Your not allowed to ride a bike, board, etc on a crossing
GET WELL SOON 🥺🥺🥺
Oooooooo 😁
Am I the only one who actually saw what happened there? The car ran the stop sign, the kid was in the crosswalk and almost got hit. He reacted by busting the windshield. That guy giving chase better have some protection on him. That skateboard is known to bust out windows, heads won’t be a problem.
Justice served rich people and their cars they are not privileged civilians have the right away not snotty rich bitches
Justice served rich people and their cars they are not privileged civilians have the right away not snotty rich bitches
Nice work, BOY.
That&#39;s why everybody hates dumb kids
Fair play to the lad. The driver Blatantly wasn’t stopping at the stop sign was he… I’d of done the same 🤣🤣
The kids should not have done that, but it looks like he was about to run a stop sign
This has been found as staged. Cameras caught skateboarders waiting at the side and stuff.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQHkO1XY_g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQHkO1XY_g</a><br><br><br>Carlo P Gonzalez, now &quot;Lambo Carlo&quot;.
Dumbass jealous kid gets a felony charge and ruins his life to act tough
legends say-that guy is still chasing that kid
Every here saying  the guy in the lambo is at fault, well the kids a little shit for smashing a windshield, so guess they are both dickheads
His parents retirement fund 💀
Cool thing called insurance
That’s what you get
Do you think the passenger caught up with the kid? I sure hope so
This kid should be put 10 years in prison.
Looks to me like the car just rolled through a stop sign and almost hit the kid.....kid was justified and I hope he got away
This is kinda funny you deserve it
The windshield is probably worth more than that whole kid has made in his life.
Good cuz he didn&#39;t stop for the sign. Think he got a expensive fancy car and avoid stop sign. Smash more
jajajaja well deserved, next time don’t run the stop🤣🤣 I would’ve done the same to that POS in his shitty car💀
you can hear a douchbag yelling in the background
Everyone in this video is awful
Ngl, I hope that kid got away
Douche bag in expensive car get window busted for running a stop sign and then honking at kid he almost ran over.
Last day ever for that kid.
you expect the windshield of a house worth car to be at least skateboard proof...
Y tho?
NOT BECAUSE HE IS A KID. THE DRIVER DIDN&#39;T HIT HIM BECAUSE HE IS A KID HE TO DO WHAT HE WANT
the driver meanwhile like &quot;could you at least shut the door when you leave smh&quot;
Now for what? Fucking skaters
Dont ask anymore why most ppl hate skateboarder
Even if this was staged, THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE VIDEO!
The definition of &quot;kids these days&quot;
Lol awww poor rich people. Lmao your mp4-12c was cool in 2014..
Lambo driver too privledged to stop at a stop sign and faced justice.
Broke btiches are always jealous ..
In russia this is the fastest way to die
you think he’ll use his skateboard to escape
Ain&#39;t a 250,000 one ...but i did run her bicycle over... nothing happened 🥱
I bet that kid was killed
Fake
Gutted...<br>But if only the guy had loads of cash to replace the..oh wait
DashcAm
Maybe it’s cause I drive all day everyday and I’m used to being cautious, but that guy should have stopped behind the crosswalk. Probably scared the kid and he took it out as anger on the windshield.<br>Either way both were wrong, kid was maybe a tad more wrong 🤷‍♂️
Lamborghini fault. Never stopped for the stop sign 🛑
Legend has it the kid is still running
Once upon a time, a blue cap guy was having his way to office when he saw a orange gta car on crossway. Then he clicked a pic to register a complaint against Carl Johnson.
I mean he is driving an expensive car, what is $1000 to get the windshield replaced
250 is a stretch 😂😂
Yea yo. Order of operations. He blew the sign, almost hit the kid, still honked his horn like it was the kid&#39;s fault, kid fucked his windshield. Good on the kid.
The kid chanted &quot;tax the rich&quot; before smashing the window, idk.
Don&#39;t run stop signs you entitled douche canoe fuck that pos Honda
Skateboarder was probably crossing the crosswalk while the car casually rolled through the stop sign.
Well there goes 10 grand
If someone did that to me id fucking kill them
Wow this camera guy is so good
This is staged
Is the kid alive?
Brat
Plot twist: The camera man was impressed by that BMW x5 parked nearby, not by the mclaren*
This skateboarder is the biggest jealous piece of sht i have ever seen
Next time he should stop, I would&#39;ve done the same
That&#39;ll cost a few skateboards
Kid lapped Forest Gump 3 times!! Lmao!
That guy had a stop sign and ran it and almost hit a kid is what really happened
It&#39;s crazy how cheap these go for second hand these days, at least here in Europe you can get one for 99k€
He a runner he a track star
I’m honestly glad. Dude blew over into the pedestrian section when you could clearly hear the skateboarder crossing. Then he had the audacity to honk at him after probably almost hitting him? Windshields get free replacements anyway. Lives don’t.
It was obviously fake the guy jumped out the car and the driver left him.. faaaaaake YouTube
Don&#39;t be a assclown simple as that buddy almost hit someone and was cutting other cars off
Would have been a different situation if it was a black guy in the car tho😆
Good, what a shit looking car
Wait did he just ditch his buddy?!
Skateboards are considered non-pedestrians in court. You’re not a “pedestrian” if you’re on a skateboard, YOU have to give right of way to other pedestrians. So him skating the crosswalk without looking would be treated the same as someone on a motorized cycle or bicycle doing this.
Offices I saw Everything
Holy shit!
Give me 250k ill buy you 2 of them.
Hopefully they caught the kid and sold his kidney successfully 🙌
Rich kid trouble 😂
Good lad
Nice car totally run the stop sign.
I mean tbf the douchebag didn’t even stop at the stop sign.
Kids are cancer
Those cars are waste of money      55 Chevy big block.    Much cooler
The kid should be punished by going to jail
If someone did that to my car, they going to shit themselves.
&quot;welcome to the hood.&quot;
The kid knew he fuc*** up
This is the most bullshit video I&#39;ve seen so far lol
Camera guy is high
Hopefully the kid got away
The skater wasn&#39;t at those lines..he was in the middle of the <a href="http://street.you/">street.you</a> can see where the car stopped.and skater popped out of no where..you can hear his skate too..I know how they drive those assholes, like they own the roads and can drive  in the middle of the roads
nice camera skills m8
And that was the last time that mid was seen alive
Dude that guy needs to go to frickin jail for busting an MP4-12C
Behind the scenes :<br>https://youtube.com/shorts/GEki9SWckuo?feature=share
100% deserve that you don’t pull up on the crosswalk and honk at people because you own a nice car...
Cars fault was in crosswalk
Nah, fuck that shit, I&#39;d have burnt rubber flipping around and chasing that bitch with the car. Hit my car, my cars gonna fuckin hit your ass back.
Kid is my hero!
Of course a broke ass bum on a skateboard will fuck up someone’s valuable property!! They don’t know the meaning of value! They’re broke!
Stupid driver. Dont honk at someone crossing at a crosswalk.
I mean.. at least he got the windshield and not the hood
Guys when some stupid assfuck breaks your insanely expensive windshield, trust me, you get unlimited stamina to hunt that bitch down, as long as it takes xD
He did roll past the stop line.
For a those saying the Skater shouldn&#39;t have reacted that way... You try getting nearly run down and see if you act logically or emotionally 😂
Why have the camera on if you miss the most important part 🤦🏽‍♂️
Jdm kid detected
It actually drives me fucking nuts when people see something like this happen to someone’s car and laugh. The shit isn’t funny it sucks.
Stop sign n he was gonna run it so it deserved to get hit
I love how this comment section is acting like they’ve never rolled through a stop sign in there life lol. And then they defending the lil prick that smashed his windshield!? I hope they get every penny out of that kid
Turns out that this video isn’t real
Don&#39;t roll through stop signs like an asshat
I hope he finds him and beats the living shit out of im
Based on the sound alone and lack of actual footage of the event, it could be possible that this was a failed shooting attempt by the bloke inside the lambo. He forgot he had bullet proof glass and the kid ran when he saw he was under attack.
That kid deserves everything he gets when he&#39;s caught
you get what you pay for🤣
that kid is GONNA PAY
That&#39;s not 250 looks like a early 2010 model mclaren&#39;s don&#39;t hold their value like other brands
Someone said &quot;Worldstar&quot;!
Fuck that child <br>Bet he was a hater who fucking hates others being successful
Kid: I think its easy to grow money lets smash it <br><br>Didnt even know its easy<br><br>Chaser: Your dead kid you are dead get blood
Skate Power : good Job 😁
McLaren MP4 12C
This must be the same camera man behind all the ufo sightings
All skateboarder need to get their ass kicked.
Me if u can afford to waste a quarter mill on a car u can afford to fix the windshield.
Drop the phone and drive away
The car didn’t stop at the stop sign
This is so much bad... I hate that Skate board guy...🤬
To be fair the guy completely blew the stop sign.
The car owner is in the wrong as from the timing of sounds and the literal fact the car STOPPED ON THE CROSSWALK.
I like how the people behind said &#39;yo the man got killed&#39;🤣
I&#39;m pretty sure the kid is dead
Well hopefully the kid didn’t beat up the dude that chase him with the skateboard 🤣
Get right away ..😡👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
The dude didn&#39;t stop, you can see on the left corner a stop sign, there&#39;s walking markers, the dude passes the stop sign, almost runs over someone and then has the nerve to honk, while also driving an expensive car? The dude had douchery dripping from him and the skater dude dried it up for him real quick. I&#39;m on the skaters side.
Oh he’s mad
He should have stopped at the stop sign instant karma if you ask me.
It wasn’t the skateboard that cracked the windshield, it was karma.
Kids parents are gonna pissed as fuck when they hear about that
I imagine that kid is on a milk carton and 6ft under somewhere
Running the stop sign is really bad. The pedestrian has the right of way. I can see why the boy is pissed. Just do a stop, and go, you won’t offend people that way, in your cocky car. <br>Not saying window smashing is the right way to respond too.
Since when is a mp4c 250k
i hope that kid future got ruined
He ran a stop sign and almost hit a pedestrian. He deserves worse.
Dude had it coming.  Should have yielded to the kid on a skate board.  Almost hit him.
If you google the incident you&#39;ll find the video was staged if you couldn&#39;t already tell
He ran the stop sign. Fuck em
Probably rental
Yeah so I assume if the camera guy was pointing the correct direction, the car was not yielding to the pedestrian who legally had the right of way on the crosswalk. Car beeped, car got damaged.
Yeah but did anyone listen to the two girls in the background?
I can’t imagine what will happen to that kid if the guy caught him
What about this guy not stopping at the stop sign? Driver deserved it..
Oh snap that’s next to Little Man Ice Cream in Denver
That kid is gonna get killed when he gets caught.
If the kid had pocket sand, he could have blinded the man chasing him  and gotten away Scott free
I&#39;m not going to feel bad for someone who has a car like this
I love the part where this all really happened
So you all saying this was just a set up ?
I Hope he gets the Kid
Nice.
You have that fast car but decide to get out and run
Rip to that kid when his parents find out and have to pay for him
Okay...and???
Car glass repare Car Glass remplace !
Dash cam
Atta boy
mans gonna get sued out of his life savings
youre supposed to turn off the engine
Hahahahaha. Buy another one Richer.
deserved.
Deserved it. Shouldn&#39;t of honked at him. Its called being nice.
This is the exact guy who records school fights.
Broad white strip at the stop sign is where your supposed to stop, he didn&#39;t! Pedestrians have the right of way at a crosswalk, his horn honking Indignation cost him a windshield! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justsayin">#Justsayin</a>
If that were my piece of shit kid he&#39;d be getting the belt
Rip that mp4-12c
Completely ignored STOP sign...almost hit the skateboarder....expensive mistake😬
He deserved it. <br>Went  through  stop sign, didn&#39;t  give way to pedestrian
Kinda awesome 😂
Fuck that asshole. He ran the stop sign. Fuck YouTube
Lmfao 👏👏👏
Bruh why&#39;d my man&#39;s do that to the 12c
Car is not 250k😛
should’ve stopped at the stop sign... dumbass
Hey shoulda stopped at the stop sign u fuck!
Run a stop sign get what you deserve
That&#39;s what you get when you run a stop sign and trying to hit people like an idiot I would have done the same thing if I was on my skateboarding Somebody almost hit me doesn&#39;t matter what type of car the rules of the road are there for reasons to keep people safe you want to be stupid pay the consequences I praise the kid for smashing the stupid guys windshield
The kid with the skateboard fr could’ve just gotten shot by the driver/owner of the car
Should have stopped at the stop sign
Why some cant have nice things like the scar boarder. However he thought the hank was rude so he his windshield is my guess
Umm, he did run the stop sign.... Hope he learned a lesson.
Entitled car owner doesn’t even stop at the stop sign and almost hit the kid.
It is staged. There&#39;s 3 angles of this. Who is across the street; filming a street corner? In that angle; the camera is recording before before the Lqmbo is even qt the intersection. It&#39;s all too clean; too perfect..
I would have a body
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s more messed up,<br>The kid smashing the window, or this guys filming skills.
i woulda dipped off too lmfaoooo
Dude ran the stop sign
Don’t honk at random people
THE CAR DIDNT STOP AT STOP SIGN. ITS WHY SKATEBOARDER IS MAD.
I wonder if they got the kid haha
Well car should have stopped at white line first! Well deserved especially after guy in car says the other guy is going to killing him!!! Lols that&#39;s a crud joke or idk but sounds like child words~
I would never stop chasing that kid
Staged
Lol good
I hope the kid got away, those car guys can be such douchebags
Bro if you skate you know there&#39;s people who won&#39;t stop at a big ass stop sign and will just keep driving by I have seen dudes get smacked because of people like this not saying smashing the window was cool however I get it.
So much of this screams set up, maybe the crowd didn&#39;t know but ...
Dam that kid F&#39;d up, but if I was him at that point I woulda prolly truck slapped the foo chasing me, ditched the board, and changed on the quickness!!!
More like 150k
I heard the worldstar at the end
i hate all this skater kids thinking they are cool 😒
I&#39;m guessing when the prick in the car didn&#39;t stop at the stop sign almost hit the kid and honked at the dude as it&#39;s his fault so the dude smashed his window. So I&#39;m not sorry for the driver.
This is what happens when kids are jealous .
Lmao I love that kid
lmao that felt good to watch
Unless I don&#39;t know how stop signs are supposed to work, I gotta say, I might have to side with the kid on this one
Lol the guy at the end who yells &quot;World Star&quot; 🤣
You would be a great school fight recorder
Legends say that the man is still chasing the bou
the driver should have stopped at stop sign before white lines. At least the kid hit the windshield and not the fender.
This was staged. This isn&#39;t a new video
Man If this was real
Guy deserved to have his windshield smashed. The dude clearly ran the stop sign.  It&#39;s not like it was for no reason.
Kid was wrong for what he did but at that age I&#39;d probably do the same thing if some dumb ass almost hit me because he didnt stop at a STOP sign.
F to pay respects
I hope they never caught that kid 😅 balls of steel. Those 2 probably deserved it. That kid wouldnt have done anything if there was nothing
Reminds me of the time I smashed my phone screen
That one guy at the end “WORLDSTAR”😂😂😂
It is crazy to me that the kid doesnt throw away his scateboard to run faster : 0
“Look at that cool Subaru dude“ – the cameraman, probably
He ran a stop sign .... almost hit him ?
Mcclaren 650s 3.8 liter-turbocharged m838t v8 engine
Man should have stopped lol
Ha ha
That’s what happens when you don’t do your stops. Drive like an asshole, get treated like one.
Anyone knows what happened to the kid?
This was staged.
In all fairness that driver went way father than the line was to stop. Maybe he almost hit the guy on the skateboard. They do have tempers. They&#39;re like motorcycle riders with mirrors lol all jokes dont hate... but seriously
hope the kid got away lol
He was rolling through the stop sign without stopping
That kid is fucked. That man is going to chase him till the little shit runs back home. Then his parents are going to find out what happened then get damages bill...then they get the metal belts out.
If that were a woman he could not have retaliate because there&#39;s no reason to hit a woman. Lol
The vids fake
Peals off in such a way as to assure you feel no sympathy
feel bad for the owner, but the driver didn&#39;t stop where he was supposed to and pulled into the cross walk where the skater should have right of way.
Idk why anyone would be pissed. Insurance covers that
He has money to buy another 🤷‍♂️
Fuck these dudes. Go kid!
Lol!!!🤣
Love this
Well, that kid is dead.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7yt-VPYtOA&amp;t=1">00:01</a>
Parents are gonna be paying for a while haha.
I’m in my super car, I’LL CHASE YOU ON MY FEET!!
And now his parents must sell their car.
Bruh I feel so pissed watching the video. The car better be okay.
Worldstar
Dude even the supercar dude made a mistake. You dont need to punch the fucking windshield dude. Did you know how much it cost to fix it? Fucking kids these days.
I hope he caught that piece of $hit.
I would&#39;ve fucked him up when I caught him
If this camera guy earns his living off of his camera he&#39;d be starving to death for sure. He don&#39;t even show us the moment where the kid actually smash the car instead he&#39;s pointing his camera all over the place like rain drops at absolutely nothing in particular infact all we get to witness is the audio useless lot much like a radio. Btw the car cost more than a quarter million
Fuckk that guy 😡😡😠
Yo so I know how this looks. We not all like that
Guy ran the stop sign and probably almost hit the kid. I say he deserved it.
This is why a skate its better to an ultra luxe sports car...<br><br>Bart Simpson<br>Gemma Teller <br>This kid
Good on the kid.
Why?
Everybody looking the accident...<br>Me: thinking why the crowd is there in line😂
Legends say that they&#39;re still chasing!
Honestly the McLaren driver deserved that one. The way he pulled up to that stop sign makes me wish his dad pulled out
Good kid, fuck rich people lmao
A prick gets what prick deserves sometimes
Bruh it ain’t 250k
his 250k car cannot chase any little kid
The guy didnt stop at the stop sign, arrogant
Let&#39;s goooo skater kid. Hope he made the clean getaway.
Ain&#39;t no windshield worth someone&#39;s life. Don&#39;t say that kind of shit.
Karmas a bitch
Easy replacement if you can afford one you can afford crashes
If I pay $250k, my doors self close
He shouldve dented the fender. Probably would’ve taught the driver that money doesn’t automatically buy respect especially when rolling through a STOP sign. Entitled bastards
At the end: “worldsta—“
That old Mclaren ain’t 250k
Seeing this puts a big smile on my face. Fuck that prick in the car, he can afford another windshield 2000x
Maybe stop at stop signs?🤷🏻‍♂️ idk
If he would&#39;ve got shot people would be like he did nothing wrong
Guess luckily it wasn’t the body or paint. Windshield expensive. Body work uh fortune
I mean the guy ran a stop sign and probably almost hit the kid on the board
The kid got some balls.
Ladies and gentlemen…. This is fake.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQHkO1XY_g">https://youtu.be/0iQHkO1XY_g</a>
The kid and the driver are both a POS.
If I was crossing the street and that car &quot;beep&quot; on me I will smash the windshield whit this both guys faces. XD
Its a rental!!!! 😱😱😱😱
Ran the stop sign and probably almost hit the kid 😂
Weak as camera skills
Guy filming is an idiot might as well just delete the video
Maybe he should learn how to stop at a stop sign, I’ve seen the full video and he almost runs into the kid while he’s crossing the crosswalk
Nice camera work.
Good for that kid, screw those uptight materialistic twats. Break more of those windows kid, you’re a legend.
This is staged by the way
I respect the move
I mean he blew threw a stop sign and almost hit the skateboarder. And yall know how skateboarders are
That kid would “trip” on a knife going straight into his neck
Runs the stop sign. Almost hits a pedestrian on skateboard. Blows horn at skateboarder. Doing all this in an obnoxiously coloured hyper car. I wonder what could happen...
Link to news channel video that this is faked 🤦‍♂️ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQHkO1XY_g">https://youtu.be/0iQHkO1XY_g</a>
This video is supposedly faked. Look it up on YouTube lol 😂
That’s what he gets he didn’t come to a complete stop when a pedestrian is in the crosswalk
I get that he was mad and embarrassed, but he seriously didn&#39;t stick around to get the video footage from people for insurance reasons?!
Dude dude that’s stop at the 🛑
I woulda helped with the foot chase and helped beating that dudes ass!! Smfh
Skaters have and will always be pieces of shit
Looks like he ignored the crosswalk and stop sign. Douchebag’s lucky he walked away with a broken windshield, not a manslaughter charge.
Damn
who cares he can fix it that was great beeped at the wrong kid right there prob almost ran em over tryin be cool for the people lol idk fuck it its orange anyways
Well that wasn&#39;t very nice. And Where&#39;s that f#<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23king">#king</a> camera pointed?
No wonder skaters got so much hate
Reminds me of that movie The Rock. “Dude, you just f—-ed up your Ferrari!”
There should be a mandatory follow-up to this video. Did the kid get away? We need to know!
Totally deserves it stop at the sign dumbass
That’s what he gets for running the stop sign and almost killing the skateboarder. Trust me, you’d want the kid to hit that windshield with the skateboard rather than you hitting the skateboarder with the windshield after running that stop sign. Count your blessing and let it go.
Fake as fuck
Totally fake
Amateur
Good on him 😇
I have no sympathy for the driver after he ignored the stop sign and then honked his horn and anger at the kid who had the right of way. Dude was a douche and deserved it.  If I&#39;ve been there in the audience watching I would have laughed my ass off.  Rarely is instant karma quite so satisfying.
Isn’t that the whole point of vanity? To be destroyed and teach people a lesson?
I don&#39;t get why people do this?
Legend says he&#39;s still running
He deserved that shit.
Bad cameraman like where are ya aiming the camera at my boi😂
Meh, He can afford it
Don&#39;t run stop signs asshole
And that skater is dead to every skater don’t even try it
This video is literally <b>*YEARS*</b> old.
I&#39;ve seen this video where you see everything. This is the DB standing next to the other guy.
Sarap barilin eh 😄
“Sorry bud…” OH YEAH THAT FIXES EVERYTHING
That was a rental car. Hes good if he bought the insurance
That guy didn’t stop at the stop sign and beeped at the dude coming across the street like it’s his fault
Car driver passed right through the stop sign. 🛑🤦
Maybe he’ll stop next time.
i mean he did jus roll thru the stop sign
damn thats tuff
That kid is dead lmao
there is a better vid of this.<br>the driver was distracted and did not stop, guy on the board had to jump off to not get hit buy the car, boarder smashed the windscreen coz the driver hooted at him lik it was his fault.  i would have also smashed it except i would&#39;nt run.
But is the board okay?
Of course a white guy yells out world star
Prolly better this happened cause usually the guy gets out acting tuff and the kid kids him in the head with the skateboard actually gives the guy brain damage and then gets hard time, lil slap on the wrist and if that guy has that kinda money for the car I’m sure his insurance policy is gonna give him the money and make his payments go up a bit and just give the kid community time
Nah guy had it coming to him. Don’t try to run people over and you won’t piss people off.
Thems crosswalks, not give way to car walks
Fuck yeah fuck that foreign piece of shit car
The just because you have a nice car doesn&#39;t give you drive while pedestrians are crossing rights
Lambo did run the sign into the crosswalk, possibly almost hitting the skater then acting like it was the skaters fault? Just conjecture as the cameraman doesn&#39;t know that you have to point in the direction of the action.
Plot Twist:<br>The kid is actually faster than the car and the two guys combined
maybe that rich prick should watch where he’s going and stop at the stop sign with a pedestrian crossing. good on you, skateboard kid. you’re a true hero.
Just looked this up and apparently it was a spoof. The windshield was already fucked and it was due to be replaced the next day. I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s true that it&#39;s a lie.
He deserved it for not stopping at the stop sign. 🗣KARMA!
That kid should never be heard from again.
For all you guys out there assuming it&#39;s real, no it&#39;s not, it&#39;s a fake staged one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQHkO1XY_g">https://youtu.be/0iQHkO1XY_g</a>
That’s what he gets for not stopping at the stop sign
The other white person world star smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
I&#39;m rich so this is nothing like hating on the rich, but there was a Stop sigh, but it does not give the kid permission to smash somebody&#39;s car...
Yep fuck his car
guy on car:oh im so popular😏<br>skateboard kid:nope (and then breaks window)<br>guy on car:oh ur done
Modern problems require modern solutions
Bruh a windshield is a windshield
Key still in the car
Sorry? Fuck him.  That&#39;s what the jackass gets for running the stop sign.
See it as a good thing the camera wasn&#39;t in the right spot. You can&#39;t see the kids face making it harder to identify him.  Besides,  if that dude can afford that car,  he can pay for a new windshield. If anything,  it&#39;s the cheapest part of that car.
That smashing sound just made my day :)
For those of you who have joined us right now ,I&#39;m here to explain: <br>GOOD <i>_</i> ING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN; <br>SO THIS LAME ASS CAR OWNER DISOBEYED THE STOP SIGN N RAN INTO THAT KID ,INSTEAD OF GETTING OUT N CHECKING HIM HE HONKED ,SHOWING HIS LEVEL OF DOUCHBAGNESS ,LITTLE DID HE KNEW KID HAD ANGER ISSUES ,N YOU CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT ,WE DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE KID ,BUT THE CAMERA MAN GOT FIRED. <br>[BBC OUTRO]
no need for such expensive cars its just a form of transport
This my friends is social justice, how dare he drive a Lamborghini when there are hungry people around him?
Hilarious.
why he doing ?
So...he just left his friend behind?
Stop signs aren&#39;t a suggestion, they&#39;re for you to stop BEFORE the crosswalk. I&#39;m glad the kid hit his windshield hard enough to bust it. Lambo douche got his just desserts. Go ask daddy for more money I&#39;m sure he&#39;d love to hear why
This was filmed outside Little Man Ice Cream in Denver Colorado. Recognized that area.
My boy got the wheels
Lmao good
When you flex how rich you are to people
Driving a high performance car does not exempt you from following the rules of the road. Well deserved, fuckin douche.
Stop sign 🛑 prick.
Stop at the stop sign and yield at a crosswalk. I have no sympathy for the car owner.
It is because the lambo ahole went through a stop sign
Oh sh<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23t">#t</a> my gosh
As always, the camera man missed the event
the guy chased him down and did what? Beat him up or sum
The car ran that stop sign, so... Yeah.  Props to the kid.
Rich prick got served instant justice for blowing that stop sign. I love it.
This in Portland?
Well that kid probably got beat to death or is going to jail, what an idiot, I used to skate to and was a little punk but this son well you just tossed your life in the toilet.
He looks like a douche bag anyways....I&#39;m sure he has the money to repair the car.
Hahah
The amount of people here defending the driver is insane...
Completely ignored the stop sign and almost hit the kid, and then your Bundy ass mate chases the kid down like he&#39;s gonna fucking beat up a child. Typical supercar owners
Don&#39;t run stop signs on busy streets, you won&#39;t have a problem
He ran the stop sign so good for him..
If it was my car, doesn&#39;t matter whagain. It was, I would chase after the POS and break the punks arm and leg and make sure he can never do something like that again. Can&#39;t stand skate boarders in the first place...bunch of punks
I’d just pull out the problem solver
Than the idiot drives fast after I guess to get the shattered glass all nicely distributed in the interior.....
He should have went for the hood or door that would have costed them more money
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
He ran a stop sign, what did he expect?
I mean they drove right through the stop sign then honked at the kid who had the right of way. Total toolbags
The real sin was the cameraman and his inability to just film
Who ever recorded this needs to be arrested💯
Feels like some kinda douche bag carma. F*ck that car, and the douche bags driving it.
Oh he dead.
Its a cool fucking car
Nah fuck that driver. Nearly hit the skateboarder. Guess stop signs with white borders are really optional. Homie didn&#39;t need to break the windshield, but if a Lambo driver ignored a sign as I went for a trick, nearly hitting me and honking as if it&#39;s my fault, I&#39;d be pissed beyond belief. Learn to drive
Was this a bit he just left his friend
Some kid smashed my cars windshield so I smashed his skull.
Next time maybe he&#39;ll stop at the stop sign and not almost run over that kid on a board...
Did the driver skip the stop sign and almost run over the guy on the skateboard???
Jesus Christ loves you and wants to give you salvation. He wants us to participate in the most beautiful symphony of love in history.<br>As the Triune God and Son of God, he abandoned his post and became a man (but did not lose his divinity). He came down from heaven to deliver us from curses, sin, evil and condemnation.<br>Jesus received the punishment we deserve from our Heavenly Father. Our sins must be punished and Jesus came to pay the price. So we don&#39;t have to pay for ourselves.<br>And after that noble sacrifice, he rose again to his honor.<br>God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, so that we may all believe in him and not lose him, but have eternal life.<br>If you believe in Jesus Christ and believe in His Word and His sacrifice, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit will open the door and give you eternal life. Only by faith in Jesus Christ and his sacrifice, not by works so that no one can be proud<br><br>Glory to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, God bless you.
Worldstar at the end 😂😂 smh
Karma. That&#39;s what you get for running a stop sign and honking at a pedestrian.
Invejoso é foda
To be fair the guy didn’t stop at the stop sign and almost hit the kids it was his fault
Street justice, I love it.
To be fair he didn’t stop at the stop sign and seems like the kid was crossing…
I would Have SNAPPED !!!!! DISRESPECTFULLY
Sorry bud as if it&#39;s going to make it all better lmao
Kkkkkkkk kkkkkk se fudeu
Let’s go kid they deserved that
If you have that car I’m sure you have money to get the windshield fixed so I don’t feel bad lol
No sakteboard was harmed in this video 😂😂
WHAT THE HECKS MAN WHO WOULD FREAKIN DO THAT they was probably jealous or did so STUPID dare like obviously they did this for attention🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
This is old. And this was staged
Totally deserved guy ran a stop sign and nearly hit someone
Fuck that stupid car.
