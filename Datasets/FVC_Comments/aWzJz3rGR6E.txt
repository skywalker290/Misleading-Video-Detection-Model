They fell for a loony toons trick!
Either if this man fails and going to be remembering as stupid or being successfully escapes and being a genius. <br>Turns out he got the latter results 😂
I&#39;ve never wated more to believe on something lmao, but seems like it&#39;s edited
Sneak increased to 100
It was probably because it was too dark. We know how hard it is to differentiate a clothing rack and a shadow demon when it comes to dark rooms.

XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I hope this guy was eventually caught and went to trial, just so they would be forced to show this clip to a judge and jury
Only possible in the USA xD
This could’ve ended very badly if the dude was armed. They walk in completely oblivious and don’t do a complete search, smh
That swat team is cartoon level stupid!<br>They all should be fired!

In their defense, the room was pitch black and clearly they weren&#39;t shining their flashlights around.

🤣NO FUCKING WAY!
This shows how stupid cops are.

Only with charlie chaplin music.
&quot;I can&#39;t believe that actually worked!&quot;
I now understand why police are afraid to go in for active shooter/school shootings. It ain’t the shooter that’s gonna kill you, it’s gonna be your buddy who didn’t clear his corner
my iron valorant teammates can check corners better than these guys 💀
Bro ain’t no way😭

One of the oldest videos but still one of the best
All of them are fat....
to the people that think this is real, look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWzJz3rGR6E&amp;t=11">0:11</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWzJz3rGR6E&amp;t=13">0:13</a> and pay very close attention to the top left of the sign. It literally shifts out of place for a few frames because the freeze mask wasn&#39;t 100% perfectly overlaid. lol. there are a few other errors, but that&#39;s the easiest one to spot. (that and the desc says its fake)
Idk man it might be real, but ive been raided two times once at a friends an one by FBI at my house an both times by the time i 100% realized what was happening , even thoe there screaming &#39;&#39;FBI search warrant !!! ** Loud AF ** an that Shocked WTF is going on moment passed 😱😧😱, they had every room clear , all the lights in the house on everyone zip tied face down , an where Destroying the house  <b>*well they called it &quot;searching&quot;*</b> 🙄 An they always come deep AF like 30 of em , He had way to much time to react an  then start look for a spot to hide  ⌚🤨 ⌚
Where’s the sound?
bro played metal gear irl
Reminds me of Metal Gear.
Plot twist: they realised he was there and managed to wait for him to leave
stealth in video games:
Plot twist: They actually make him think that they are gone and waiting outside...
All those years later were is he doing  this year now 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
If you guys want to know what happened afterwards he got caught he started to make noise and they open the door and spot him if he had waited just a little bit longer his wanted level would have went down and he would have been a free man
Yeah, it actually is fake. This was a police search for the Boston marathon bomber after the terrorist attack and this guy just editet himself in.
This video reminds me of that kid who put on a bucket on his head as a disguise during a neighborhood shooting 😂
This has always been my favorite clip of homie getting away from the puercos ....
Stealth 100
How did no one see his legs?
then he farts
now that’s out of the box thinking on his part
hiding in a house doesn&#39;t work:<br><br>pretending to be an inanimate object success👍
To people who think they were just dumb, they weren’t actually dumb it was actually just swat training
Freeze !
I wonder how stupid every officer involed felt after seeing the video 😂😂
this man successfully hid from the skinwalkers
Is &quot;Yakkety sax&quot; melody copyrighted?
Sheesh the fact that when they doubled back, the guy up front checked the left side and not the right so they all just followed along. If he would have looked right i feel like they would have saw him. I can only imagine how hard his chest was POUNDING lol
This guy invented the big brain
Definetly 4 star  wanted level  and  he got away... Gta for reals
Sneak 100%
What&#39;s that noise? <br>❗<br>⁉️<br>I&#39;m seeing things...<br>Patrol! Nothing to report
After this that guy walked into the police station willingly just so the cops didn&#39;t have to live this moment for the rest of their lives.
Needs Benny Hill music.
So polite, he even closed the door
ROFL i cant  belive none of the swat seen the fucknig sandels and feet on the way out ROFL
I would be shaking like crazy I can’t stay steady when I am scared
Gdniu
Well they called in the wrong special forces
Now put pumped up kick on this
These idiots need training
Did he get away?
This video is montage, i saw the original video without him hiding, he just found this place and make second video and put it on first one
When the first guy to enter the site didn’t check his corner in Valorant:
Yep that&#39;s how a roze skin players would play in warzone.
Sneak level 100
Obvious fake, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWzJz3rGR6E&amp;t=13">0:13</a> if you look closely on the guy you can see that there&#39;s a cut in video editing when the door open.
Mans playing prop hunt irl😂
That the second cop was checked right to the corner the man hiding but he couldn&#39;t see him lol
The only problem with using this method, now Nobody will ever be able to do it again because of this video.
Gotten lol
BRUH
Stelth +100
Tbh those those are some big ass dudes on the swat team. I wouldnt wanna get caught either.
i don&#39;t know rick...
Police helicopter: every one have a visual.<br>Police helicopter #2: this is eagle four we no have visual on the suspect,over.
The vests say transit police, why would transit police be busting down a door for drugs? Probably fake.
no way

That&#39;s not swat
In a action movie, the guy would of took them out. And exit thru the from <a href="http://door.lol/">door.lol</a>

Is this real? I’ve heard it’s SWAT training but I have no idea how THIS is able to train soldiers
Now the question is....is this fake or real??? <b>eats burrito</b>
Check the 2nd policeman that comes into the room, useless.
Moe like special FARRRCE !
Actually it&#39;s completely dark in there that&#39;s why the did not see him.they light their flashlights if you noticed.
Probably fake because they checked every spot except for that corner.
Nooice.
Extreme hide and seek be like
when you playing hide and seek and dunno where to hide😂
You are actually a boss if you know behind what&#39;s he&#39;s hiden.
I Wanna k ow the context so bad.
I think I have a theory on the backstory behind all this:<br><br>Clue #1: The SWAT team&#39;s uniforms were labelled as &quot;TRANSIT POLICE&quot;. With these, we can safely assume these men act as security in areas like train stations or airports... or that some idiot threw a red shirt in with the rest of the washing and now they&#39;re just borrowing off others for the time being.<br><br>Clue #2: The room itself appears to be set aside for storage of documents based on the shape of the containers. There&#39;s also a small window letting in some light on the right side of the room. Given airports tend to avoid such architectural choices due to their greater people capacity and popularity, we can narrow down the list of possible locations to just a train station. There&#39;s also piping on the left side of the ceiling which airports don&#39;t seem to have, but I&#39;m not 100% sure about this.<br><br>Clue #3: The suspect&#39;s attire consists of jeans, a sweater and a cap. These articles of clothing are usually worn to conceal one&#39;s body features and blend in with large crowds of people, decreasing the enemy&#39;s visibility of the player by 75% (with an extra decrease of 25% if you conceal your torso with a large object while also not moving). So we can assume this man isn&#39;t a common thief who wasn&#39;t willing to cough up seven bucks at the magazine store, he was trying to sneak past security!<br><br>Conclusion: This man is clearly a fugitive on the run. He probably grew that beard in prison before he broke out so that he wouldn&#39;t match his mugshot should they send out an amber alert. As for the crime, who can say? Armed Robbery? Murder? ...Mass Jay-walking?
What did this guy do to have a whole ass SWAT team after him?
WHAT DID HE DO THO
Those cops are the actual Genome Soldiers from Metal Gear Solid
If this is real. They all could have been dead lol the fact that no one checked that immediate left corner where he was hiding makes me cringe😂
Does anyone know where a full clip of this is?
@jomboy break this down
If you look into the description, you can find out, that this is fake

That&#39;s not how you clear a room
Super fake sadly, poorly edited
sorry to bust your balls but...<br><br><br><br><br>&quot;After this guy&#39;s home was searched by real SWAT team officers, he created a video using the footage he recorded during their search. He superimposed footage of himself pretending to hide from the officers with the original video. He made the video look like he was able to outsmart the officers and get away&quot;<br><br><br>source: <a href="https://www.jukinmedia.com/licensing/view/976334">https://www.jukinmedia.com/licensing/view/976334</a>
It&#39;s staged. You&#39;d think they look in his direction and suspect the legs.
That’s one way of avoiding the swat team
Yeah, this is big brain time.
It&#39;s fake.  It&#39;s supposedly an &quot;edit&quot;.  But I do not understand.  An &quot;edit&quot; is where you cut something out, or insert something in between.  The room is there.  The cops are there.  And the guy is there.  And the guy is there at the same time the cops are there.  Is Snopes claiming that more than an &quot;edit&quot; is involved?  Like some masking?  The only reference point I can find is whatever that is swinging at the top center/right&quot;.  When the cops leave, there is an obvious cut there.  But nothing is in the room before or after the cut.  What&#39;s the deal?

This has got to be fake because swat isn’t that dumb right?
I was gonna say where the fuck did these guys get their CQB training and then as multiple people pointed out, none of the flashlights went beyond a point on the ground, and you can also clearly see when they unfreeze the frame where the guy is standing. Oh well atleast they fooled a few people with this video, but whats even funnier is how desperately asshurt anti-police people are trying to prove that this video is real. lol
