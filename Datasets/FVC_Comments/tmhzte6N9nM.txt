ohh god they don&#39;t have shelter it means the forest area was decreased so this will happen
Its a baby.
What a beautiful hippo
nice video
Read the Fucking Title its NOT india
Not everyday you&#39;ll see a tiger cutting traffic
This happens bcoz we cut forest. &amp; also we kill animals for money. We need to save them. But careless villagers cut jungles &amp; waha rehene jate hai or aagar animals waha aaye to maar dete hai matlab animals ke ghar me animals nahi rehe sakte how sad
I love my india 
poor motorcyclists
The kings walk.... lol
Who let the tigers out {rawr,rawr,rawr,raaaaawr }
hope that tiger is safe.
omg
how this happen
So sick in many levels
edit
It&#39;s still not an adult tiger, completely lost on a busy road. Just imagine if a human baby of 2 years is lost on a busy highway in a completely different civilization whose rules it doesn&#39;t understand, and running here and there, completely frightened. <br>This shows that some people get dumber as they get richer (with easy money flowing).
