ok so.....what the hell is going on here.....is this outside the bataclan?  and where are those gunshots from?...and why is there no ems there?? this video is mainly disturbing and frustrating
fuck islam
We will never forget.
and salah is still alive in prison on vacation , cool justice huh?.......... no comment , get death penalty back on track france show no mercy
AK47 works very well !
Just so you know there were 5 French soldiers nearby (Opération Vigipirate at the time I think, since renamed Opération Sentinelle) but they received from their superiors orders NOT to attack the terrorists. The officers feared &quot;un surraccident&quot; in French... I let you translate that with Google. Yep, very clever French military officers and the governor of Paris thinking that it was too dangerous to send the squad in the Bataclan albeit there already were dozens of dead civilians...<br><br>The two guys you see entering the Bataclan at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XnGKJAarhA&amp;t=123">02:03</a> are 2 brave police officers with just a handgun, deciding to try and stop the terrorists on their own (they had asked for the soldiers to help them, but the sergeant of the team had answered that he had orders not to go in... The policemen managed to kill 1 or 2 of the terrorists and forced the last 2 to stop the killing and retreat into a small room, stopping the massacre.<br><br>By the way, I am a former French soldier, so I am not criticizing out of nowhere. Just imagine how many lives would have been saved if the officers and politics had been more courageous, and not fearing for their career if one military bullet hit a civilian by accident.

Why does everything always happens in Paris that&#39;s sad to see the lost. This scary to see in real life Tbh.  😥
a 1minute de la video c&#39;est le vigile putain
Has world war 3 started or is it just a mid life of a country crisis. France would you like a biscuit in this time of crisis
truly upsetting even after 2 years..sooo awful
You can&#39;t save someone who has bled out like that, it&#39;s so fast. If there&#39;s no pulse to speak of it&#39;s not like in the movies, and sometimes people make terrible noises as they&#39;re bleeding to death. You have to triage the people still making noises and breathing, try and stem the bleeding. When you do that then they have a chance, but with an ak-47 it&#39;s not just one hole. It&#39;s a lot of holes and hydrostatic shock. Shots to shoulders and legs hit arteries all the time.
Groetjes uitApeldoorn van mij persoonlijk !!!
in iraq and syria, people die like this every day, and you dont say a thing...when something like this happens in europe or america the whole world cries, I don&#39;t support ISIL, I think too they must be destroyed, but you are hipocrites
this is horror and hell on earth.i think the camera guy is under a shock.he dont know what he do.whats with the man/women on the floor on the exit from bataclan where the pregnant women was? so many peoples are running out but no ones helps. on video i can see this person is alive. i hope she/he is ok now
Why did you not help them
This is why migrants must be out of Europe.

And now we know the French government suppressed the torture that happened at the Bataclan.  Eyes gouged out, testicles cut off and shoved in victims mouths, women stabbed in their vaginas, stomachs cut open.  They did the same thing a few weeks ago in Bangladesh to people who couldn&#39;t recite verses from their demonic book the Koran.
Some brave mother fuckers shooting innocent people that are unarmed.
please I beg whoever released this, disable these comments. utter scum of the earth.
stampage thats what you see  people are hurt becouse of panic not terrorism prank is prank
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XnGKJAarhA&amp;t=123">2:03</a> ish was the a cop or Terrorist? you can tell he is holding a gun and aiming, why would this person be so. close to them?
M-U-S-L-I-M-S destroy your country and will destroy eaurop, its fact! and its alredy happaning....
salah rat est en cage
Pray 4 Paris, Pray 4 the Parents.
he in red shirt is in shock and have a loved one inside, thats why he is standing there and starts crying, :( so terrible sad
pas mal le français, je suis vraiment désolé pour ce qui est arrivé à Paris😭😭
ISIS is going to pay the consequences! I hope they keep getting killed by assassinations.
don&#39;t invite any refuguess from any muslim country...
These attacks disgust me,but you know what else does? How the cameraman and other people around are just standing and watching people die in front of them,without making any attempt to help at all.Just because you are not police,military,paramedics or whatever doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t help out a fellow citizen.
I can&#39;t even watch this its so hard!!!  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
WTF IS THE VIBRATOR IN THE BACKROUND
Blame Israel cus they are controlling Isis, isis=Israel secrecy intelligent service, ppl these days.
THIS IS SO SAD
🇫🇷God bless those unfortunate souls, may they rest in peace, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pray">#pray</a> for Paris 🇫🇷
.03 the lady is faced down and bangs the floor (isnt she injured, why hasnt she been put in the recovery position) then the man in the off white shirt against the wall blood soaked if he&#39;s loosing blood he aint going to be sitting upright?
This FOOL is filming people bleeding to death instead of helping and giving these people the last bit of dignity they have left without it being spread all over the internet feeding into the terrorism.
Why whoever you were did you not go to the guy sobbing..injured and crying..you record him..but you do not help..i could not film this..i would have been doing all i could to help and comfort..
Le monde pleure par la france et les syriens qui pleure
If we don&#39;t make a move quick . They will....
Maybe I&#39;m just too stupid to understand why but how come the attacks on Bataclan started at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XnGKJAarhA&amp;t=1300">21:40</a> and special forces didn&#39;t run into the building before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XnGKJAarhA&amp;t=20">00:20</a>? Two freaking hours in which dozens people more died? What did those soldiers do for more than two hours? I understand that they have to get a broad picture of the situation and try to prevent more victims but... seriously: more than 2 hours?
I&#39;m disgusted by religious freaks. If you are a Muslim, shame on you. I know you probably don&#39;t support this, but I still  think that by being a member of this cult, you are implicated in the proliferation of dangerous ideas.
fukn sad..I hate terrorism. .I hope thy rott in hell fr this.bastards
this video made me cry...very sad. and to people criticizing  whats going on, im sure a lot of these people are in shock
NATO do your yob already
How is it no one is comforting the dying and injured?  I understand this is a volatile situation, maybe I don&#39;t understand how critical the surroundings are but everywhere this camera man pans is a dying and suffering person. Crying and moaning. Their last moments of life. Yet no one is comforting these individuals. How is that? It is unbearable to watch.
This false flag is so poorly done still the sheep believes all the vomit that cames from TV.
So, if these terrorists are inside the Bataclan and if they immediately began shooting people, when did people run out the side exits as shown in the other video? In this video, and others, the view down the side street shows it completely deserted.
👋✊🏿👏
Pray for paris
Go look for John Doe&#39;s contributions if you want amazing &quot;insights&quot;<br><br>Cleverly structured phrases which will convince you of his knowledge of world events and ability to bring  to your attention all those fine details which would otherwise be lost in the confusion. (joke)
WTF! So many drunk people lying on the ground!
All the funeral services - didn&#39;t get documented. CNN and BBC films of the crying relatives never aired - were never made, it was such a lost opportunity to make more headlines and gather support but no one could work out who actually died. In a war they are paraded around with flags over their coffins. But this is not a war - just an excuse for a war. (But more died this weekend in USA from alcohol, than died this YEAR in France from mysterious shots from dead people - not really worth a headline is it?)<br>Can you smell a rat?
wtf is going on?!??!!!!!<br>Why are there vibrations??! why is that guy on top of that dead girl??! need I say again wtf??!!!

where are all the knob head human rights activists shouting about closing CIA black site prisions and not torturing terrorists now???
Muslim religion is the main enemy of france
I&#39;m Muslim and I don&#39;t like the french, not because of religion or ideals but on my experiences with French people both online and in the real world. feel free to hate as it&#39;s your opinion but just know that this is mine.
It doesn&#39;t matter about &quot;good&quot;muslims, it doesn&#39;t matter about &quot;moderates&quot;.....the fact remains that islam has some serious issues and problems like no other or not on the same scale. There has been plenty, countless, of islamic terror groups past and present. There are also imams and islamic political ideological groups who call for an end to western culture and democracy.....that doesn&#39;t exist with other religions and immigrant groups.
From :38 to the end, the place seems oddly quiet and uninhabited, Except for a couple of allegedly injured persons that we can&#39;t see because of the dark, the place seems, pardon the expression, dead. Early in the video the good views looking down Passage Saint-Pierre Amelot show it to be completely vacant and a civilian in red shirt stands there and moves around unconcerned. When will the patrons come running out the side doors and acrobats start hanging from windows? What is the source of these allegedly injured people we see on the sidewalk in front the corner business, a wood flooring or floor tile store I believe? Were they shot in the theatre and ran out and down the street?
and malaysyan boing aswell .
now charle ebdo can drawing funny and happy caricature about bataclan with sexual and humour charactistic as joke ,the same as they draw about russian boing .
+MrTunes said: &quot;You are a fucking moron, that probably supports mass immigration so would rather this did not happen rather than be the result if it, which it is. , anyone with a tiny brain can see the event took place other that fucking idiots who desperately seek for and even make shit up. There have been many witness accounts all making sense. Us here in the west have decency, we respect peoples feelings and we do not hold dead bodies up to the camera like the do in the middle east. We respect...&quot;<br><br>But this disrespectful comment contradicts itself - clearly. Sadly there are no calm quiet arguments (other than asking for respect) SUPPORTING the official version, nor any evidence of survivors running screaming (like they were going to die) from the venue. Sorry but the three films made available anonymously 1. the hanging woman, 2. the music scene cut off in the hall just at the point where an attack could be seen and 3. The scene which begins with a guy sitting beside his dying girlfriend and looks more like he has been waiting for a hamburger than experienced death all around, all three &quot;real scenes&quot; are for ME, just not enough &quot;Proof&quot; that this event was real. Sorry for being disrespectful but I have not seen a single howling victim, a single dead terrorist, nor anyone seriously running for their life. I have seen people half-heartedly running up the side alley, changing their mind and going back past the doors from where death was streaming out, and the cops were waiting until the filming was over to go in and only special commandos who were later filmed by &quot;just some guy&quot; who managed to cut his video where it would show even more, but did show enough for us all to ask &quot;why was he wandering around when the whole place was sealed off by the Paris police authorities?&quot; I think that we are due some answers instead of this ranting about respect, when the question here is of NATIONAL and INTERNATIONAL significance. That is my own opinion and I have seen nothing but insults and &quot;B&quot; roll in response. Are there no news people left who AREN&#39;T living in fear for their jobs?<br><br>THIS is the place to show your minds since although Youtube is owned by the &quot;western powers&quot; they still HAVE to let a little of our voices arrive here or we will seek other websites to voice our opinions. It could very well change soon and then perhaps there will be not a single doubter - just people who agree 100%  with the brave new world. <br><br>You said &quot;idiots who seek for and even make shit up&quot;. I didn&#39;t say anything untrue. But I did indicate things which arouse doubt and your response, like the other paid or bloodthirsty commentors all on the official story side,  is cursing and swearing like savages. Just take a look at what you are writing - MrTunes.<br><br>Incidently I have looked twice through this whole list of comments and have not been able to find your comment anywhere to be able to answer to  - youtube sent me a mail to indicate that you had commented but as it is not to be found (due to the lack of a &quot;comment name&quot; search facility by youtube) I took the effort of writing your comment (letter for letter) again including all the spelling mistakes and punctuation errors.
That&#39;s just sad
everyone ask why they stay there and why they don&#39;t leave, probably because they have friends there, they are waiting someone? maybe?
why is he brushing his teeth?
Omg   that&#39;s  brakes  my  heart
Why aren&#39;t you helping or assisting or comforting instead of filmiing????!!!!!!!!
😭😭
Thats just eating away at me seeing those people laying there like that, especially the young Women. breaks my heart. fuck.
Good acting.  First of all, only a true scumbag would actually record footage of dead bodies.  Secondly, youtube doesn&#39;t allow this kind of content, if it were real.  You can cry all you want, sheep people, you do the same when you watch sad movies.  They play with your emotions and use you to pass bills that further enslave you.  Full-grown adults, being played like friggen violins...Gullible as ever.  How about those bombs made out of a soda can and a piece of string?  Still believe in those?  This is the sad part, for me anyways.
I am a muslim..this broke my heart to see people of paris hurt like this..they are innocent people.
The most disturbing vid I have ever seen.  This is in Europe.... it&#39;s heartbreaking.
So many people don&#39;t seem to realize that when something extreme like this happens 99.99% of people get in total panic mode. You won&#39;t think rationally when you panic and see people dying all around you, so don&#39;t judge these people.
now that isis is breaking balls all over middle east... petrol price is very low... arab companies are losing power and they are more weak as far as politic weight. someone must be satisfied... dont you think so?...
This was so sad to watch! Ive been praying for Paris all week. My heart goes out to the victims and to their families! I&#39;m glad most of these ISIS TWATS got their comeuppance on Wednesday when the raid took place! R.I.P to the 130 people that died!
My husband and I love France, love the beautiful city Paris! We made in Paris our little honeymoon! Rest in peace for all the poor people ;_;....that makes me so sad ...
In this video, we witness the true 2015 Tour de France.
Excuse me if I sound rude, but have you people who bash on the filmer tried to understand the person didn&#39;t help?<br><br>Personally, he fullfills a pretty important role documenting the aftermath of this tragedy. In comparison to me, someone who kind of lost the feeling to be compassionate about people I don&#39;t know (I have my reasons), doing this makes me assume he at least cares. People often don&#39;t understand me for looking the other way non-chalantly when there&#39;s death involved either, but after I actually start explaining why, most of them understand. <br><br>I feel like this guy may know about himself that he isn&#39;t that good in comforting/helping people, and instead does the best he can to do at least something. At the very least, he may have a motive. It&#39;s just that we don&#39;t know about it.
what&#39;s to say they was even real bodies? Just curious
awful those poor people..hope the scum rot in hell
How can the police let people film freely in an ongoing crime scene? even worse, how can the police neglect having someone on their back?
May the victims and there family&#39;s and everyone find peace of mind.
We need more compassion, stop recording and comfort some of those people.
Terrible, i would say a lot of B50 bombers en blow Syrië totally down!!
en lugar de grabar te ubieras puesto a ayudar pendejo
Some conspiracy guys calling it hoax.
This make me so mad. I cant believe people are capable of doing horrible things like these. I know how crazy world can be but i still get shock everytime something like this happens. Those lifeless bodies... Nobody deserve to die like that. I dont hate muslims because i hve a lot of friends who are muslims and theyre the most peace loving people you&#39;ll ever know.  RIP to all the victims of this nonsense killing.
If there was ever a reason for eradicating this filth from the earth then this is it They have been taking the piss for far too long and those bunch of numptys at the UN need to be removed as they are as much use as a chocolate fireguard. Let us send everything we have even nuclear bombs and remove this shit stain from our world
extremely sad.  :-(
This is heart wrenching!
GET THE FK PUT QUICK!!! But not now your doing a video I want to see
Seeing this dead woman lying on the ground in the entrance is heart breaking.
Some videos just shouldn&#39;t be on you tube
¿ tiene lógica que ISIS se enfrente a los 5 de la ONU y gane ? ; como en las Malvinas donde militares argentinos ayudaron con su ataque al avance del nuevo orden mundial , aquí también los de ISIS han ayudado al establecimiento del nuevo orden mundial liderado por los 5 países ( Inglaterra , Francia , Estados Unidos , Rusia , China ) sirvientes de los elegidos de Jehová , todo parece indicar una nueva modalidad del 11 s
Why are there very few people helping the wounded?
Well the real criminals are the ones who created those monsters.  Now the monsters are unleashed.  Who is selling them weapons? Who is educating them? Who gave them this power? <br>I am sure we all know the answers. <br>I don&#39;t believe that the USA OR FRANCE OR BRITAIN or other EU members could not stop them!! <br>USA had permission from congress to invade Iraq because Saddam was a criminal, how come they cannot get a permission to invade Raqqa and destroy ISIS? why did Israel treated wounded ISIS fighters in Israel? So many questions!! So many lies! When they invaded Iraq they stole all the gold and treasures, same for Libya, now they did the same in Syria.  <br>Iraq was beautiful, so was Libya and Syria.  Now they are all ruins filled with monsters.  I pray for all the innocent children and people from all religions (Christians and Muslims) who died in vain.  RIP🙏
FAKE!!! This is all to bring in the New World Order! WAKE THE FUCK UP NOW!
Cut at :30.
NO es justo de que la jente pague tan feo sus errores
I&#39;m sorry for all this!!!!
j&#39;habite vers paris <br>nous les francais on a pas l&#39;habitude de voir des arme,des mort,des coup feux c&#39;est horrible
this makes me so sad :(
D+.<br>Poorly staged.<br>Not enough blood. Groaning not at all convincing. Police presence not at all realistic.
This is horrendous and my heart breaks for all the victims, their families, and the survivors-left to deal with this trauma the rest of their lives; for all of humanity. I hope we bomb the shit out of those animals and show no mercy for them. This video truly felt like I was there and I can only imagine the horror.
U.S. has to wait another year before we can fuck these clowns up. As an american this pisses me off. My sympathies for the french. If it wasn&#39;t for our dovish, head in the sand president, we&#39;d tearing that ISIS shit up right now. Say what you want about us americans but we know how to kill bad guys. Nazis, al queda, Viet Cong, North Vietnamese Army,imperial japanese army all can attest to that.
Man just hearing that guy cry is making tear up so bad and I&#39;m a guy 😥😢I just hope they catch and kill those bastards
RUSSIA GO!
Shocking to relive that moment like this
daesh+pkk=129 mort
The year 2015: Kalashnikovs and smartphones.
like these scenes are the daily scenes  in Syria and Iraq and Afghanistan  and more horrible  by the bombs of America and France Russia England etc.<br>a minute of silence for the victims in Syria and Iraq and Afghanistan  .
man they should question this guy filming this shit kind of nonchalant like he had something to do with it fucking lame
This was the only video - that felt like I was there . Chilling !! -- The guys inside lock and loaded was pretty freaky ! I don&#39;t think I would of been walking around trying to get a video - Those guys could of turned around and shot at the person with the camera !!
francia y eeuu comenzaron, pues se han vengado
Worst... concert... ever!
all isis nothing but assholes... fuck...
Brings me so much pain and sadness seeing the dead people on the ground. Who went out to have a good time. not even thinking or believing that it would be their last moment in life.<br>Without even grasp the situation or the moment before getting killed. This is terrible and disgusting, an inhumane, raw and brutal act of animalistic diabolism.
Some basic first aid could have gone a long way here. Possibly saved some lives. Interesting that so many people were just standing around while some were clearly crawling and moaning etc.
Is graphic documentary but the person who filmed with his phone use it vertically, this is a big mistake, for filming phone must me horizontally only.
If Donald trump gets in office imagine what the U.S is going to do to Isis
This is extremely sad to watch the innocent people crying in intense pain. I cant stop imagining what if I or my close ones were the victims or even had to witness this. <br>lets hope these isis fuckers and other terrorist groups are destroyed for good. Hope France and Russia does all it takes to finish them. Hope they show that Europe is powerful and one shouldn&#39;t mess with it. <br>long live France and Europe.
wow I like how he sees if he can help anybody.   no difference from the boston firecracker.  i say staged event

Right in the undefined middle of a shootout this person walking around with a mobile phone,  filming the dead as there is nothing better to do.
as a muslim, I feel the pain and hurt caused by this, please dont blame all Muslims, ISIS hurts Muslims the most, even though this has nothing to do the vast majority of muslims, I want to still apologize for those who seek to place hatred in the minds of all good people.. we feel and share your pain, shock and loss.. peace out...
Religions are made by men. You still believe in everything a fairytale book says?<br>My religion let me develop what my prophet says. No heaven selling, no hell threat. No need to worship, just doing good is enough. Thats why my religion wasnt that popular, because men love a fairytale. Not just love, but they need it. But nowadays, human make it too far. They fought each other just because of a fairytale books.
Pretty cool people could whip out there eye phones and video the carnage rather than save innocent lives
Right Jazzy, that&#39;s why it was a 2hr response and 89 in the building killed

It needs English subtitles.
Que terrible , mis mas sentidas condolencias a los familiares, desde México un fuerte abrazo
&quot;Religious fundamentalist scum&quot;. There is no possible excuse for such insane barbarism in the name of some whacked out deified fantasy of martyrdom, and virgins. This will lead to more, retaliation, death, and destruction, that has already begun. We are now forced to endure the vile insipid speculations of corporate fascist media whores blowing things out of proportion, making wild accusations, and speculation on anti terror strategy which they have no clue about, as with most things. Syria hasn&#39;t changed a bit in the last few years except on the surface. This insanity has been a constant undercurrent festering for decades, under the (Assad &quot;regimes&quot;) the insane moronic arrogant invasion of Iraq, merely opened Pandoras box, as everyone with a brain knew it would, but they were ignored, Because Bush, and Darth Vader knew better?<br> <br>The endless parade of self serving back stabbing, money grubbing pundits, and military advisers, who will say anything to make a story, for their handlers, to make a buck. Truly despicable, and disgusting. The proper course, is exactly what the Obama administration has been pursuing, ( shoot, and scoot ). When you can send regional players like the Kurds, to take ground initiative, you do it.  A  U.S. ground war at this time would play right into the hands of the ;lunatic fringe ISIL PIGS. Stick with the plan.This is a special operations, proxy war, and for now it should stay that way. When the enemy is most vulnerable, then you hit them with the heavy hand when the advantage is in your favor, and not before. <br><br>Remember the idiots that started this filthy mess, the (NEOCON right wing morons), that slapped the hornets nest, and left all those tanks, and armored vehicles, and armored Humvees, and heavy machine guns, and rockets, and hundreds of billions of American taxpayer dollars for ISIL to make use off, as if anyone with a brain couldn&#39;t figure that one out. They got in over their heads, and they &quot;bailed&quot; leaving the mess for Obama to sort out. Luckily his cooler head has prevailed or it would be an even bigger (Neocon) mess Bush Cheney Rumsfeld, and the right wing morns are the direct cause of this insanity. They ignored the sound advice of all the smartest people in the room, then they lied, and went in anyway. Welcome to the results of right wing stupidity. The moron right wing lunatics, and boneheaded blow bags make a stinking mess out of every thing they ever touch.
are the people of France - Paris think or believe the gouverment and police did there work good and kick help?? There sercret survice where kept a eye of couple of radical IS people from 2010 and the let them travel in a rental car from belguim to france. 😱

This is repugnant. There are no words....
will anyone translate the yelling at the beginning and the mid portion where the filmer is whispering to others?
This is devastating
c&#39;est affreux !!
oh sorry i am with you paris they are not human....<br>isis,taliban.rss,vhs all are haters <br>they have hate virus in their brain or blood <br>fucking religious people...
Das ist so verdammt traurig...mir fehlen die Worte ...Herr Jesus behüte uns vor solch einem schrecken. Amen!!
Most amazing video so far!
Tout se paie et ils doivent payer trés cher pour ça.Ca ne ramènera personne,mais il le faut.Svp les politiques ,laissez tomber vos rigidités et agissez en bonne intelligence.Faites fi de vos étiquettes,on en a rien à foutre.Un seul objectif,ces pourritures d&#39;islamistes à démolir même si ça doit prendre des mois.On ne veut plus revoir ça dans nos rues.
correction not Paris anymore, its Al-Paris.
We all click this video because we are curious... I really kind of want to know what they all say as bad as that sounds.. But actions speak louder than words and this is brutal
The time has come for a Second Crusade....
Read the Koran People, wake up before it&#39;s too late
Pickthall Quran <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XnGKJAarhA&amp;t=519">8:39</a> And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is all for Allah. But if they cease, then lo! Allah is Seer of what they do.
Event of 1500 people sold out and no police presence,.... ?
Fuck ISIS. They do not represent Islam.<br><br>True Muslims hate them just as much as the rest of us, make no mistake.<br><br>I hope the attackers got to meet their god when they died, and I hope Allah condemned them to an eternity of pain in hell.
Je suis musulman, et je suis énormément touché par cette barbarie, Grande pensée pour les familles des victimes, et paix aux âmes des innocents qui ont perdu leurs vies, ces terroristes qui ont fait ce carnage n&#39;ont ni religion, ni conscience, et n&#39;ont rien avoir avec l&#39;islam, je rappelle que parmi les victimes il y a des arabes des noirs des blancs des musulmans des chrétiens des juifs des bouddhistes des athées, la preuve que ces terroristes leurs but c&#39;est de semer la terreur, et ils sont que des minables assassins, soyons unis et solidaire pour vaincre l’obscurantisme sans faire d&#39;amalgame. Reposez en paix tous les victimes vous êtes dans nos cœurs.
The Syrian army has been fighting these animals for 4 years. The world should support the syrian army against ISIS.
А нас а что ?
this is Just when terrorists  are still inside shooting people
الحادث الأرهابى الذى حدث فى باريس الجمعة 15 / 11 / 2015
Poland is with you France !
how is this on youtube?<br>there is dead people literally everywhere.<br>God damn
Why you stand just? Why you didnt help this people who blooding??
Islam has no place in a civilized democratic society. It&#39;s teaching are primitive and incompatible with western civilization. Just look at the world. It is a scourge to the earth. Speak up before it&#39;s too late. It&#39;s not racist or islamophobia to want to live in a free nation established on Christian values and anyone that says so is bigoted against you. When they get the majority you can guarantee they will force sharia law upon you. That is what they are taught.
Can someone translate?
Unfortunately, this is a momentary stir in connection with these attacks, and the west did not reach any lessons from this. Do you have a laundry done in the brains that think the greatest threat imaginary wave of nationalism not see what really happens and affects you. Your leaders will not worry about you, but that does not woken Islamophobic attacks.
Nuke Raqqa.
At the beginning I want to write that very sorry for the French what happened and do not wish anyone ... but I also want to say that I&#39;m not going to identify with them, because I do not want to be a ram led to the slaughter. Too much multiculturalism. We Poles do not give ourselves to introduce many Islamists as you. National unity is the way to defend our history, culture and livelihoods
My heart shattered hearing that man cry for his dead girlfriend. Peace and Prayers to Paris.
OMG  😮

Замечательные карикатуры рисовали в Европе, когда упал самолет российской авиакомпании! А какие креативные футболки появились! Может теперь нам, русским, тоже нарисовать парочку, посвященных этим терактам? Скажите, господа толерантные европецы, что вы думаете об этом?
this video is rly heartbreaking :c
This is like something out of a movie. They condition us to be numb to it, but this is real frightening . My god .
It&#39;s heartbreaking to hear the vibrating phone.  You just know that whoever is calling won&#39;t get an answer.
Fuck the Russia
shit
NO ONE DIED!!! This was training exercise!
War....what is it good for?.....
FUCK this shit and FUCK everything about it
SMH
who would stand filming and not help nor flee while people shot and DYING?!<br>DRILL, but 10/31 224 killed wasnt
Death is unnecessary.
So like where are all the police? Just civilians walking around bodies with phones.
BFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF sin palabras...
Es muy triste :-(
