Duck high !
I think that gargantuan explosion that destroys that fucking goddamn Walt Disney World will be so very much worser than the Tianjin explosion because it&#39;s gone. You&#39;re gone, Disney!
Seeing the room lit so brightly from the explosion....holy god. Standing near windows is a bad idea.
holy shit...it&#39;s so far but in the same so close because of the size of the explosion..this is terrifying
This footage was only around some 800 feet away from the epicentre of the explosion.
Are u guys ok lol
He says &quot;Oh! My God 😱&quot; <br>&quot;Oh! Shit&quot; and the little thud sound you hear immediately after he says that is his constipation 💩 freeing itself and falling into the toilet bowl. Recording the effect of a blocked toilet in the distance which led to the apocolyptic explosion of sewerage pipes 😃😂

This is Hilarious.

We wasn’t able to run on the first explosion but at the second he ran but the shockwave was more powerful that the windows broke

He is smart to duck for cover from the second explosions shockwave
This guy might be the smartest person I&#39;ve ever seen who reacted to this explosion<br>Telling everyone this is serious, getting away from window, going in the bathroom where it&#39;s usually deep inside the building and strudy thanks to water pipes.<br>The only thing he did wrong was filming the explosion.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=46">0:46</a> no jump scare can top this horrific sound of real explosion!
China said 147 killed in this one. They tend to miss numbers of 0 at the end of their statistics...just like their covid-19 data.
solo espero que este bien
Looks like Michael bay is making another movie
The heat of the explosion is dangerous but the shockwave it causes is 10x more dangerous.

The most insane video I think I&#39;ll ever see in my life

Beirut was apparently more powerful than this, which is crazy because this looks just massive.

Shit i thought stone cold steve austin was coming out after the glass shatter 😂
He was so far away tho, just crazy
i had this on full vol and headphones when the 3rd explosion hit. no joke, that fucking woke me UP UP
That&#39;s God&#39;s punishment for them.
Good thing he was well aware, or that glass would&#39;ve added him to the casualties&#39; list.

Imagine the explosion 100x more powerful.
Jeez it looked like he was miles away!
hoooly...wow o.O
I remember this day
You know when shit is real when Chinese people start cursing in English
<b>Esa explosion tiene muchos detalles fuera de lo normal... Esa onda expansiva y sus efectos... Cuanta gente salio volando? Incluso autos y demas... Se ve claramente el doble Blast Sonico que despide la primera explosion y la segunda definitiva mente fue tan destructiva  que la propia realidad fisica no pudo contenerla y trono de un solo toque con un solo sonido para despues estallar en silencio debido a la gran fuerza expansiva</b>
holy fucking shit!
Jeeez man you and your family survived the most craziest I&#39;ve ever seen
Cocks gun at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=27">0:27</a><br><br>YOU WON’T KILL ME YOU STUPID EXPLOSION.
The explosion occured at the port of Tianjin in a <b>container storage station</b> . Around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=1370">22:50</a>h a fire broke out inside an <b>overheated container of dry nitrocellulose</b> in one of the port&#39;s warehouse. Firefighters were <b>not</b> informed about the presence of over <b>40 hazardous chemicals</b> stored nearby, while they had to fight 10m high flames on an area of 70m^2. The used <b>water started to react</b> with calcium carbide, which produced <b>acetylene</b> (highly inflamable) and thereby propelled the fire&#39;s spread. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=1416">23:36</a>h <b>700 tonnes of sodium cyanide</b> (toxic acid) exploded in reaction to the fire. This blast had an energetically equivalent of <b>2.9 tonnes of TNT</b> (based on seismic data). Just 30s after this first explosion, <b>800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate</b> exploded together with <b>500 tonnes of potassium nitrate</b> , resulting in an explosion with an equivalent force of <b>21.9 tonnes of TNT</b> . 173 people encountered death that night, while 797 were injured.
Holy fucking Jesus
Omg ☹ that is horrifying, my heart hurts to think of all the fear and loss of life
Restos fragmentos humanos, eran al principio. Que sad. Saludos!

is it just me or does the 2nd explosion sound like + respect from gta san andreas?
woke the baby
I&#39;d be running fuck filming it RUNNNNN
He should STAY PRETTY, BUT PRETTY FAR AWAY FROM WINDOWS, BUT INSTEAD, HE IS FILMING INSTEAD OF GETTING SHELTER?

Hory shet
Bad mistake closing the window.

Chinese people are so lol
“Oh shit!”  Made me laugh...  sorry but was kinda funny.  Hope he’s okay
:44 Translation: Holy fucking shit
Does he died
It exploded because you were vertically filming.
the thumbnail looks like that building near the explosion is collapsed. pause @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=42">0:42</a>
The 2nd blast is crazy
The tumbnail looks like the top of the building broke off.But it was just a piece on the window.
how many people did actually die? you cant tell me that didnt hit anybody in nearby buildings... scenes like these you guys have only seen in movies. everybody would shit his pants! i feel very bad for the people around this place.
This is a window repairman&#39;s worst nightmare
God bless you anon
Looks like hell
I&#39;m amused he said &quot;this is now very serious&quot; and the explosion right then goes &quot;oh ya? try this!&quot; (second boom).
Why is no one else commenting about how he pulls a gun out?
That&#39;s a really good reaction time, just a fraction of a second late and you&#39;d be having glass sharts down your eyeballs
this is only just a big factory explosion and it was pretty devastating, now imagine how devastating one of today&#39;s nukes would be like, loud explosion on impact and then silence for a few seconds followed by a massive deadly aftershock that nobody will survive
That silent echo noise after the explosion at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=43">0:43</a> is so scary.
second drop was fire
Damn his window was vibrating on first one. I hope he took his family to a room with no glass after that
If i saw an explosion like that i would be hiding under the bed lmao
Ok that was the real blast effect, this was fucking scary man, thanks to the guy who uploaded this...
ITS GOJIRA!!!!!!
I feel so sorry :(
The real question here is why do chinese all say &quot;oh my god!&quot;.
I visited this city in 2001. Didn’t see much of it but what I saw was cool.  RIP to all the dear people and I hope their families are moving on.
Gotta love shockwaves. The most destructive parts of an explosion. :/

I only heard about this two years after the fact and I keep a close eye on the news.  Just goes to show how China&#39;s news about tragic events like this is &#39;objectively good for its people.&#39;
I left my stove on. - Did I miss something?
What happened after the second explosion??
We need to do the USA like that. I mean, it&#39;s just a joke to em anyway. Jokes are funny.

Omg if they make a movie about true story that would be sad😰😰
Come back to this video after watching the footage of the US military dropping the &quot;mother of all bombs&quot; on ISIS. This explosion dwarfed the MOAB, period.
It&#39;s sort of amazing how even native Chinese speakers are like &quot;OH MY GOD!&quot;  I thought that was pretty neat.
That is not a broken window it looks like some one just bombed the place he was living in.
Was that a terrorist attack or a normal accident
it&#39;s lit
look on the right side there&#39;s a teddy bear on the window
jesus christ
the fail of a nuclear bomb on china
It&#39;s so dangerous to stand next to a window when there are explosions outside. Yes I know i&#39;m captain obvious, reminding you that a piece of glass flying at 100 mph can cut your head off.
The videos of the Tianjin explosions are like the closest thing we&#39;ll ever get to see to a nuke going off in a city, without war being declared.
damn😱
Tactical Nuke!!!! INCOMING!!!!!
tom lah
Me if I was there... No NOT THE BAKERY.. MY DUCKIN HOUSE!!!!!
we dont care about the window lol
He was just under a kilometer away from the explosion, too.
That explosion looks almost nuclear...
scared the English out of him
This is so wrong and disgusting - why do they allow explosives to be contained in a storage facility situated so close to residential buildings?!?! That&#39;s awful :&#39;( those poor souls didn&#39;t stand a chance and that baby&#39;s cry chilled me to the core :&#39;( Didmt 5000+ people perish instantly? So sad :&#39;(
What the heck caused this to even happen?
holy shit dude (Stan Marsh voice)
Hoo! That looked nasty!
His reaction was good. Most people would have been to awed by the explosion that they would probably have their face ripped apart by the flying glass
It was just Saitama&#39;s Serious Punch.

I live the way it says broke window lmao
It&#39;s so crazy that the first two explosions occurred within 30 seconds of each other but the second explosion was far larger and involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes ammonium nitrate.... So lucky your colleague survived with his precious child. All those pets and wildlife and those who lost their lives will remain in my thoughts... Even though this was a year ago.
Imagine how fucking scary a full blown World War 3 would be.
that 2nd one was a close call, he knew he had to run for it fast
What did xplode there?

Your friend&#39;s colleague is lucky to be alive

When i saw the explosions, i was like : Holy molly that was cool ! But then i went to the comment section and then you guys made me emotional fu guys ;-;
Next time you’re filming disasters, hold the camera horizontally people!<br>The YouTube community thanks you for your understanding.
this is terrible and very sad for those who suffered this explosion.  but jesus christ, if you&#39;re going to step up and be the camera man, be a goddamn sport and stop shaking the fucking camera.
.... you hear him run away after the second explosion. this is mad!
Why the fuck did this not get more coverage?!?! I watch ABC, Fox, CNN, BBC, and Al Jazeera daily.  I must have been out of commission because holy shit, this is fucking so sad.  Anyone have a more realistic guess on the death toll? No way it&#39;s as small as they say..

He said to &#39;get away&#39; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=43">0:43</a> before the explosion aftermath broke the windows and, like, I wouldn&#39;t have thought to run away from the windows for some reason.

IS THIS EVEN BIGGER THAN A NUKE?!

What &quot;Oh my god&quot; means in Chinese?
I can&#39;t believe why there are many people leaving so many retarded comments below. ..
Am I the only one who laughed at the sound he made when saw the bigger explosion happen? &quot;jzu-GAI!&quot;
This is a human tragedy. Best wishes to those that survived.
I can&#39;t wait til we go to war with these people.

I would love to use found footage (with all the credits to people who filmed) I think this video has a really important value and I&#39;d love to make it part of my documentary, trying to do a little gift for all victims and also to inform part of the world who still ignore it.
OMG! <br>Oh shit!<br>OMG! <br>This is serious! <br>Get away!<br>End.

老外: oh my god,oh my god~  oh shit！让开！
Its a good thing that guy started running the second he saw the second explosion go off. If he was there for a few more seconds filming, i&#39;m guessing he would have taken glass shards to his face.
ww3 is coming
My reaction was exactly what the guy shouted!<br>Holy fuck!
I&#39;m glad he wasn&#39;t one of the 181.  This is so damn tragic.
AND..... ISIS claims responsibility
GOD IS COMING WW3
And this isn&#39;t the judgment day yet.. scary!
He was smart to move out of the way. Props to him. It amazes me that some people think its safe to stare, unaware of the massive blast wave about to hit.<br><br>Trust me, catching those extra few seconds isn&#39;t worth having all the skin ripped of your face.
Ju hai!
RIP : ( my heart goes out to everybody there.
ok ok im feel very bad for all those who have died and who are injured. But i have to be honest the way he said &quot;oh my god&quot; and &quot;oh shit&quot; had me rolling on the floor i was dead
My country&#39;s media sucks. No news about this at all.
this is some crazy shit to experience
I wish I was there :)

armagedon
R.I.P. all peoples died!!!
炸畜生囉。
does any one else notice that the two explosions are roughly 30 seconds apart and show a violent upwards thrust of a large amount of debris. I have looked up other &quot;chemical explosions&quot; and this looks like nothing I have found. Most of all, it seems very peculiar how militarized the zone has become. I say this in regards to other catastrophes the country has suffered. This seems like it was an attack in my opinion. What persuades me to this theory is the level of military presence immediately after the event; not so much the amount of military but the unusual behavior from them. Supposedly, (and this is but merely a view with the present evidence I have been able to find), the military is showing a priority more towards quarantining and security of the area affected rather than being organized to provide aid and assistance to the civilians affected. I am not in any way able to verify the evidence I base my assumptions upon,(due to the ridiculous amount of secrecy that the government of China is accomplishing). By the government of China&#39;s actions and  behaviour only furthers my confidence towards the suspicion I hold. I urge others to investigate this tragedy further; not to further my opinion but to conjure a better understanding to what has taken place. This scrutiny will precipitate a truth; regardless if it agrees with my opinion or not.

MI MAS SENTIDO PESAME A LO CAIDO EN TIANJIN
Looks like this gonna be the second &quot;Chernobyl&quot;.
Look at those houses close to the explosion they get fully obliterated
Fucking hell. How far away was that explosion, a mile? More?
This is only the beginning for WW3... WW3 at its gates and is a matter of small timing now.. September 2015 going forward is full of surprises........ 
This is so unreal! It looks like what you see in a movie
OMFG WTF HAPPENED???
Well thank god he said &quot;Che ju chen&quot; at the end, thought it would just end in silence.
Damn, my mixtape finally reached China
ي راقل وشو ذا اللي انفجر؟
From China Daily (com cn): TIANJIN - The death toll from the Tianjin warehouse explosions rose to 158 on Monday with 15 people still missing two weeks after the blasts, according to rescue authorities.<br><br>The dead include 94 firefighters, 11 policemen and 53 civilians. The missing include 10 firefighters and five civilians.<br><br>Two blasts ripped through a warehouse in Tianjin Port where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored, including around 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide, at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=690">11:30</a> p.m. on Aug. 12.<br><br>More than 300 primary and middle schools in the Binhai New Area, where the port is located, opened for the new semester on Monday as scheduled, local authorities said.<br><br>On Sunday, no excessive levels of pollutants were found in the air outside the exclusion zone, but high levels of cyanide were detected from water samples from inside the exclusion zone, with the worst about 20 times the level officially regarded as safe.
are you ok :0
TheFineBros anybody?
I feel so bad for them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=42">0:42</a> = shit your pants time...

Brave man, I heard him shout &quot;get away!&quot; with chinese language to (probably) the kid..

ALLAHU AKBAR
And people still think the 2 explosions in china were an accident. <br>Google Rod of God and come up to speed.<br>China cyber attacked USA now USA used Rod of God as a warning. WW3 is here folks, store non perishable foods NOW.
you know it would be funny if somebody called this video fake
He knew right when to get away from the window
This is most likely caused by Japan&#39;s terrorism.
HOLY FUCK!.. what kind of plant exploded?
Horizontal, not vertical!
All these people only caring how the video was recorded on his phone, fucking people died but the quality matters more than their lives.
Better than Fallout 4 trailer. So when will this game come out?
United States will pay , Chinese are gona fuck us up ten times as bad . <b>packs bags and leaves usa</b>
When this disaster I&#39;m hurt, because there are a lot of people died. I am most angry is that the video inside the woman actually laughing.
this is insane...<br>So unreal.
GET DA WATAH NYIGGUH
oh... maybe 4 people die&quot;
Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams! video is propaganda put out by the government to make us racist and fund their war to make money off oil!!!
Hare Krishna! This material world is just sufferings!!! Get out of it!!! never come back again!
HOLY SHIET THAT WAS SO BIG!<br><br><br>No...<br><br><br><br><br>Don&#39;t say-<br><br><br><br><br><br>THATSWHATSHESAID oh, goddamit Dan!
If you&#39;re in America ey, make sure you do your research on Babylon because this might be you

I can hear Michael Bay fapping from here.
&quot;oh my god.&quot;... &quot;oh my god.&quot;.. &quot;oh shit!&quot;😯😯😦😦😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲<br>I wonder why he spoke English ?..perhaps previews international audience?<br>anyway ,tragic and awesome at the same time. I do hope the dude and his family are ok.
That is the craziest thing I&#39;ve seen! Well in youtube... But hopefully them people are OK!
China No animal protection ... so we dont care!<br><br>lol
All these other people kept standing in front of there windows not even flinching and not realizing their window would break all they&#39;ll have glass al over their ass but either way this dude was smart
The shockwave was very very strong to break the window :o
The Chinese economy takes a blow by recession then a blow physically with the worlds 10th busiest sea port having a massive crater blown in it.
If you was the filmer , you&#39;re very resistant to survive from this
de todos los videos de la explosion que he visto , este es del mas inteligente que no espero la onda de la segunda explosion... vio el resplandor y se tiro para atras....
Hory Shet!!!!!
If this video is taken in China then why is this man speaking english?
Omg !
يالله ارحم عبادك يالله <br>الله يجيرنا يارب
Vertical video =/
I feel bad for the people in China having to go through a huge accident, that&#39;s really scary.
america i pray you did not do it
i would be shitting bricks
$2000
Great reaction. He didn&#39;t wait for a second and dodged the shockwave.
that... was brutal....
I&#39;m assuming it to be less tragic from the fact that the incident happened at night.  if if the explosion had happened during the day with workers on site, the death toll would probably be way worse.  RIP to all those that lost their lives from the incident.
The warehouse was storing combustible chemicals over 70x the national safety limit.   I find it extremely disgusting that corrupted businessmen in China disregard safety of human lives for fulfillment of a fat stomach.  This is no different than murder, and these people need to be punished for their lack of responsibilities.  As a global supplier, China needs to get their shit together to overcome their lack ofcompetency.  If not, external unions need to seriously take appropriate actions.
I was supposed to go travelling china from 5th through 14 next month, got to cancel it because of this damnit.
I can&#39;t believe they are getting a good laugh out of over a hundred people dying in an explosion. I didn&#39;t hear people laughing at the videos of 9/11.
BIG BANG ATTACK
putin il a eu chaud le gas toute ces fenetres on peter mais l imeuble aurai pu etre souffler avec
Damn Cuh!!!
The smartest guy on YouTube.   Fuck it take cover hahaha
向牺牲的烈士致敬，我们中国人根本不会在意你们这些foreign idot的胡言乱语。
wow que miedo !!
&quot; Oh my gaaaa, chincuwanchinchi &quot;
Hope this family is okay so far, it seems they have a baby in the room? The words &quot;pray for Tianjin&quot; is sounded nice on SNS, in other hand it sounds too flippant &#39;cause we, SNS users, are watching it in a safe place.. but can&#39;t help praying for their recovery seriously, those heavy losses..!<br>Wish Chinese Gov sort this problem out faithfully --without cheating people in China and outside China as well... and this too: wish news media keep broadcasting about Tianjin, the media tend to be temporary and transient.<br>爆発から一週間過ぎた今日、いま一度、亡くなられた方々へ哀悼の意を。*祈*
there is no way only 114 people where killed and 95 missing. A place like that may have attracted thousands of dayworkers from all over Asia who need to be close to the facilities who are not even &quot;official&quot; I mean, this is the main seaport for stuff going and leaving the capital of China Beijing, isn&#39;t it?
oh my gah!
Odd that the Chinese guy&#39;s first exclamations were in English.
オーマイガッ!
it was me, i finally mastered the Katon Gōkakyū no Jutsu
Man this was devastating...rip to all the victims
Too hot. Hot damn.
what does suk hai mean.... take cover?
<b>BIRIBINHA ATÔMICA</b>
Fuck. After the first explosion, the baby cries out. Got real.
shokking shit
This just in the terrorist behind the attack was.none other than isis&#39; own kul aiid maan after hearing the code word, and I quote &quot;oh no&quot;
SUM TING WONG!!!
oh shit !
Amazing footage but I really hope that little child is okay.
My phone can zoom in while playing thus video, that 5 story building right next to the 1st big explosion just disappeared into dust and fire...crazy shit!! I&#39;m surprised a couple of of those taller apartments didn&#39;t fall over after that bigger second blast. I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t. Sorry to see all that in Tainjin. Hope you all get it together!!
只想知道更多的事实
This explosion was 21tonnes of TNT, to think that there are bombs out there that have 50000+ tonnes of tnt is mind boggling
And yet people say always so casually that we should nuke china.<br>Hope this makes you think before you speak. Everyone&#39;s life is precious
that 1st explosion is bad but holy shit that 2nd explosion is insane
damn
Quite witty response at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=43">0:43</a>. Saying &quot;zou kai&quot; means &quot;move away&quot;.
My friend Inpector Clusoe imform me this shit done by Muslim man...i believe at Hiroshima and Nagasaki  incident muslim are mastermind...
Hey let&#39;s blame Islam for this!
&#39;broken window&#39;<br>There was more broken than just your window.
the cia is finally attacking, Russia and China must be ready for war with usa
اهم شي طلّع المسدس ههههه
&quot;just wanna ppl know this disaster happened in Tianjian.&quot;<br>&quot;For those emails that i received from BBC, CNN or any other media, please do not repost this footage on your end.&quot;<br><br>Very contradicting.<br>First you want to let this video be shown so people know what happend...<br>And then you block certain parties from posting/using it.<br><br>Your not planning on comercializing it, else you wouldnt post it to a youtube account with just 1 video.<br><br>Why cant they have it and show it on tv?<br>So the whole world can see this video.<br>That was the intention right? Te let the people witness this?<br>Why?<br>I dont understand...
That is so crazy scary. Obviously not a safe place to live. Pray for the victims.
&quot;51 deads&quot;; can anyone be this dumb to possibly believe in this figure? censorship and whitesheep-headed medias makes jack a jelly boy.
I can&#39;t wait for the fallout when people inevitably discover that the Chinese &quot;government&quot; downplayed the death toll like they do with everything. <br><br>没有共产党才能有新中国！
A baby cry at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=27">0:27</a>. That break my heart.

Poor kid.. what a scare!..
I bet he pooped a little in the second blast.
It was Godzilla, they tried to kill him!!! Seriously though, stay safe.
this is horrible, hope everything ends soon.

holy fucking shit o.O
All these people that are commenting &quot;why did he record vertically&quot; or saying any other negative shit about chinese or the man recording the video must be brain dead, seriously. How cruel must you be to joke or tell bad things to the people there or this guy who recorded this. Grow some brains, trolls. I would like to see you in this kind of situation. I don&#39;t think you would think how to record the video better, you would pray for mercy if something would happen like this anywhere near you.
When you hear his voice at the end: relief. I pray for all those who were affected.
ho santo dios espero esten bn :&#39;(
At least someone had the intelligence to jump away and protect himself and the kid instead of trying to get an internethit by keeping to film a dangerous explosion.
INSANE footage. By far the clearest, you can see the shockwave travelling towards him. My god, I can&#39;t believe an accident like this could be so destructive. How on earth was that amount of highly explosive material in such a high quantity together? Wasn&#39;t the fire raging for some time nearby? No evacuations? what the hell is going on
what the f**k...

More than 1500 people died until now.
We have just discovered that 114 people are reported dead now. Also 58 in serious condition. We might see more than 200 dead when this is over.
Is isis there?
Shit got real
I&#39;m so glad that your friend&#39;s colleague is okay. Stay safe.
Wish you and your family best recovery from this traumatic and horrific experience. Good to know you and your family are okay. Condolences to the families of the missing, dead and firefighters who put their lives on the line.
Holy Shit! I hope you are okay! Even watching that Im freaking out!
ALLAHU AKBAR!!!!
:O
Holy shit this is terrifying
Wow! Let us pray for Tianjin, China
Omg !! I can&#39;t even imagine how much fear you&#39;s have felt in that moment I hope everyone is okay !!
Thousands died...
Ik this is a tragic moment  but who decided it was a good idea to store a poisonous and combustible substance in a city like this.
My humblest condolences to the families and citizens of Tianjin :(
Looks worse than meltdown in Chernobyl

Esse vídeo eu não tinha visto ainda. É realmente impressionante a explosão ainda mais de perto do lugar do desastre. É maior que a explosão da bomba atômica de Hiroshima que foi equivalente a 15 toneladas de dinamite mas essa segunda explosão foi equivalente a 21 toneladas de dinamite...
guess what, they sent firemen to that place before the biggest 2 explosion, what happened to the firemen? offically says unknown, but every person with a normal IQ knows what happened to them, the whole team wiped.
el 9/11 quedo como nda ante esto
99% of the people commenting here think they are born comedians. They all have lost their sense of reality and affection. Once your own life is affected, you will all pay for your lack of compassion because you will not notice it until you are looking death in the face. And there will be no savegame to start over. The people that where killed are GONE. They had family and friends that are grieving, and all you do is joke about it. If any of you still have a spec of shame, start feeling it.
wow!!!
Dios mío, esto fue horriblemente impresionante lo siento por los niños ojalá hayan tenido tiempo de retirarse de las ventanas porque la onda expansiva fue mortal.<br>E.P.D. la gente que murió.
So it looks like a smaller detonation set off the first big explosion, then came the second huge explosion. So there are 3 explosions, not 2.
Was that a gummy bear on screen?
Thank god he was smart enough to duck after that second blast!
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=31">00:31</a> I thought that was a gummy bear.
Quick thinking there... Considering the size of the first explosion, and, the amount of glass that shattered, he knew there were seconds until the shock of the second blast obliterated his windows.
WOW!!! Thanks for sharing. I thought this was going to be another of those whiny idiot videos, many killed but my poor window broke. I&#39;m super happy this family is ok with only broken glass cuts and baby is ok. Sadly nothing will change to prevent a repeat as long as us rich yet stingy ignorant $$$ countries demand cheaper yet better goods but refuse to help pay to make it safer for any and all worldwide workers. Prayers to all killed and missing and to the families who will never know and never see their family members again, both workers and firefighters.
oh my god this explosion its realy extremly
Ya top that Michael Bay !!!! Glad that the guy filming seems to be ok at the end.
What is the reason for disliking this video? You clicked on this video to see an explosion. Huge explosion ensues. Delivered as described. 👍
That is a majestic explosion!
awesome!!!
Wow this was a good shot.. Translation anyone?
and you had to record it vertically.
das ist heftig
according to local chinese people this disaster has been kill at least 2000 people or more but the chinese government denied it said only 115 people are death this is nonsense at all base on city has 15million people living
I&#39;m happy you and your family got out.
It just like in the movies
the DG warehouse is very close to resident area.
What was the reason of the exlossion?
You can see a lot of buildins get a strong hit on the first explosion... then... the second one was even bigger. And the goverment says 50 deaths? BULLSHIT!!
&quot;Allahu Akbar&quot;
omg
Like movie,. Very intense! 
SAY NO TO VERTICAL VIDEOS!
YAAAAWWWWNNNN!!!...BOOOOORRRIIIIIIIING!!!
the shockwave is.. omg
omg
Holy fucking shit. Damn :OOOO
It&#39;s got to be the largest peace time explosion in History. I don&#39;t think even Ripple Rock compares to this.
it was a 24 tonnen of TNT explosion! MASSIVE!
Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkk....!!!
Looks like he was smart enough to realize the window was going to smash when the 2nd explosion went off.
According official website, as of 8/15, 112 dead, 95 still missing.
Allahu akhbaaaaaaar!<br>Bumm!!!
Remember Bhopal gas tragedy,  The government should evacuate all residents immediately.
Freaking Chinese, goodbye Communist China, and more to come, the Judgement Day is the beginning.
омг! ЛОЖИСЬ!
It seem more powerful than air strike in Syria..
This man is rather sharp to be able to infer the potential of the impending shock wave from visually witnessing the explosion, then proceeding to warn and protect his family within a split second during such a soul gripping situation.
Wow. Scary shit. Props to the (presumably) other guy in the room for reacting instantly and telling the camera person go &quot;get away&quot; right as they saw the second explosion.
Damn, they all just <b><i>HAVE TO RECORD EVERYTHING VERTICALLY!!!!</i></b>
Look like a damn ammo dump went off,but resect to the guy took good footage
omg the shockwave! dont get close to the window! thats dangerous! omg! why the explosion look like a nucleaar!!!
omg are u all ok? I heard the child start cryin then I hope u all safe
I heard they arrested a suspicious worker early morning.  In my opinion, it is probably to do with unpaid workers got really upset and light it ups with the explosion materials.  Chinese films has the history in holding up their hard earnings salary up to 6 months or more.  I could be wrong; however history does repeat itself.
This happened before in nevada it was called pepcon.
OMG WTF
Shamfur disprayyy!!!
It&#39;s really a shame people died, but my fucking god I love shock waves, I would pay to experience that (considering no one harmed)
This is so tragic yet highly entertaining. We&#39;re truly blessed and fortunate to be watching this on YouTube in the safety of our homes.
According to my math by the delays in sound this video was recorded about a half mile away.
I just can&#39;t believe this is real! Such a dramatic explosion, I hope everyone there is ok!
Woah. this guy had the right reflexes.  Not being in front of the windows when a huge explosion like that happen.<br>However, I feel bad for the people who were living too close of this thing.
is it me or dude he just backflip
holy fuck! hell broke loose :O
that dashcam shockwave video is also incredible, RIP to all the brave souls fighting this fire.
OMG this is so chilling and very very sad....My pray to all victims on this tragedy, May God will always be with you all. Amen
jesus fuck you can see the fireball right outside his window.
O que era aquilo no vidro da janela? metal derretido ?
THATS FUCKING AWESOME AND SCARY AF!
Thank god he wasn&#39;t stupid enough to just stand there and film it. Hope they&#39;re alright.
Quick thinker!
He yelled at his kid to &quot;get away!!&quot; after he saw the 2nd explosion. His quick reaction have save himself and his little one.
Godzilla: China edition
So remember kids, when you see a huge explosion&#39;s shockwave, stay away from windows

Holy Crap
what does he say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=42">00:42</a>/43/44 ??? tzukaï?!!
the world war 3
glad to hear the little one and everyone else is okay - thank you for posting and sharing this situation with the world.
P-A-U-R-O-S-O
:/
there is less then 3 minutes between onset of explosion and you actually hear it, so this apartment is less than 1 kilometer from the explosion site. Thanks God they are still alive, don&#39;t understand why residence is built so close to dangerous site
would be a million times better if your phone was recording sideways.
Did the firefighters really try to kill the fire with water ? I am speechless ... oil + water = BIGGER Effect.
Not quite nuclear size , but still massive. When dealing with a nuclear weapon, we are talking about explosions that measure mathematically to thousands of tons of TNT (kilotons) or millions of tons (megatons). <br><br> This explosion is estimated to have been equal to roughly 21 tons of TNT. Just 21. Imagine a weapon with a payload of over 1 million tons of TNT. Now, imagine that a cold war ICBM with a hydrogen bomb warhead that has a payload of about 25 megatons, which is equal to 25 million tons of TNT. <br><br> Those nukes have over 1,000,000 times more power to release than this explosion in Tianjin.
Goddamn this is awesome.
Chris Redfield, get out of china.
This is really traumatic, but is the cause still unknown? shouldn&#39;t they research the cause so they can prevent it from happening again? anyway I hope this man and his family is safe and R.I.P to everyone who lost their lives out there!
Gotdamn, God bless the firefighters who died that day. I hope that the guy recording the video is alright as well. To anybody in China right now, my heart goes out to you and the survivors of the explosion.
O.M.F.G.!!!!! O_O
Rapid industrial expansion is never a good thing.
我草 ! 0.0
Wow.
Glad you&#39;re ok Jo!
It&#39;s disgusting how the uploader has ads turned on for this video.
And I tought opening the window is an obvious thing to do when things like this are happening.
holy fuck, at the beginning I thought that first explosion was the massive one. o.O
Biggest, most horrifying blast I&#39;ve seen since 9 /11. Looked almost like a nuclear blast!
fuck
Here it is, the Chinese take this event seriously, thery were scared they loved their land. But  There&#39;s one footage of this event from American guy, he and his friends laughed all the way thu the explosions. Damn i hate those americans.
Holy! I hope everyone is okay in that apartment! When Chinese people start cursing in English...you know it&#39;s bad!
Acojonante
maaaaan WTF!!!! O_O!!!!!!!!
This was a Dragon Ball Z fight.
this guy is really close compared to other people that filmed the explosion ... this is scary
Hey guys why not have a guess about the death numbers. I mean the one reported by media and one real. We have something more to lament besides the catastrophe.
holy shit
Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this disaster. Thank you for the up-close video; it really humanizes the damages - in a very small way of course. So happy the baby is okay.
wow
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=43">0:43</a><br>thank god this guy knew EXACTLY what he was doing.<br>see that flash, get the hell down and cover your head
damn this is scary what an expolsion that downtown has to be ruins !!!!
non de dieu !
wtf china
I wish The best for alle These people ....
It&#39;s Oh my Ga and not oh my God!
Un-fucking-believable.<br><br>Question, why the hell is this warehouse located near residences? Is it part of the &#39;fuck the people&#39; movement?
thank god he had the good sense to move away from the window. you can hear him telling his family to move away.
Shieeet best explosion Ive ever seen dang this looks like Rambo invaded china well anyway my condolences to the dead
This actually looks like the top of a huge ( millions of gallons US )  LNG storage tank when it first ignites, not a tanker ship etc, it appears that somehow the liquid nitrogen that is used to keep the tank cooled was faulty , or someone made a terrible mistake, but ti does look like a storage tank explosion. Both instances. Inside job, maybe !
I was like &quot;but it didn&#39;t break the glass&quot; and then, BOOOOOM
We&#39;re praying for you here in the U.S.! So glad that the gentleman and child are OK. I can&#39;t imagine how terrifying that moment must have been.
For a comparison: The Chelyabinsk meteor from 2013 exploded at a height of 30 km with the force of 500 kilotonnes of TNT (that&#39;s 38 Hiroshima bombs) shattering windows all over the rural area below. So this wasn&#39;t even that big....
Oh my God......God bless you!!<br>From Brazil!

chinese version of &#39;the loof the loof is on file&quot; XD....
My love goes out to the Chinese people. They do not deserve this. Probably the scarriest footage I&#39;ve seen since another calamity that happened to another oriental people. Please recover. The world needs you.
I&#39;m so sad, i feel like crying right now. Please God help them.
Those Fallout 4 announcements are really gettin out of hand
Potássio + água = explosão!
HOLY SHIT!!!
By counting from the flashlight of the blast to the noise of the shockwave, it passes 3 seconds. He is about 2km from the point.
more than 100 death
&#39;Oh my god&#39; and &#39;shit&#39; seem like universal quotes.
It is recommended to make crossed X on windows with wide transparent  scotch tape to eliminate damage and injuries from shock waves, if you see potential danger. It is about 30 sec per window to be prepared.<br>At the same time send children into bathtub with water bottles - to survive building damage.<br>Unfortunately, now, during conventional war, we in Ukraine know that type of disaster. Peace to all.
With that explosion and the densitiy of population living around I highly doubt that the deaths are in the tens-hundreds. I&#39;m thinking more in the thousands.<br>P.S. Why does he speak English? Maybe he already had the intention to upload it on youtube...
Hope the family is alright, and please evacuate instead of filming...
撮影者の方無事でしたか？
Holy crap.
That After Shock is what most people dont no its coming. I think the first explosion kinda gave him a clue. I wonder if its safer leaving the windows open
too close to enjoy show :(
This guy was smart enough to consider the shockwave
This person prefers filming the misfortune instead of his child to safety ?!<br>The should be put in jail!
This is the only guy I&#39;ve seen that responded appropriately so far. Most others sat and watched until the shockwave sent them flying twenty feet back.
He told his children In Chinese faster get away to toliet
only in china
I hope you and your family and friends are well.<br>私は貴方と貴方のご家族とご友人達が無事なことを願っています。
Damn. I know there&#39;s some feud going on between China and my country, but they didn&#39;t deserve this.<br><br>Stay strong, China. You&#39;ll get through this.
shouldnt he be getting away from the window and protecting his baby after the 1st blast? Why does he continue to video? Why he keeps talking to himself when nobody is there besides his baby? He wants video popularity? He got it.
i just know it. can somebody tell me, how could this happen??
I love the fact you cuss in English then return to speaking in your native tong.
the second explosion is the one that hurt most.
shit, imagine what it was like being in the tower blocks in front of his!
This is the fault of the United States.  YESSSS
He was smart to get away from the windows when he saw the explosion.
D: So glad he moved away from the window in time. Rip to all the people found dead. Honestly don&#39;t see why people need to do things like this. If only the world could just get along. ;-;
wtf
i&#39;d shit myself. good to hear everyone was all right.
That was fuckin apocalyptic, fuck!
0：25  did the dude pull his gun out? lol
awesome
Oh your GOD!
ппц бомбануло
unbelievable!
Wow, this is crazy!
Holy fucking SHIT
Fuck it looks like a movie
biggest tragedy I see here is you recording vertical.
Clever dude called out and stayed away from the window immediately after the explosion, just before the pressure wave reached, saving himself and the people around him from injure due to the glasses.
OH MY GOH
This is high time now that we should take care of our mother nature and see this horrific, tragic event as precursor of the abolishment and elimination of Nuclear weapons.
truly awesome firepower
gangnam style china going out in a big bang
Taiwanese accent
衝撃波ヤバ杉内
Oh shitttt.... Are chu okai? o.o
oh my god the window bloudy smashed into pieces
insanity. i can only imagine this guy&#39;s fear as he watched it, and everyone else who had to go through this.<br>this is truly a tragedy.
R.I.P to the people killed in this tragic event. Thought with the family that posted this! I have children, one as young as 8 days old. I couldnt imagine the fear i would have for them in your situation on this night. God bless.
Holy fuck.
And that&#39;s what happens when you let some wastelander use an fat man
light travels faster then sound
Will my shiping from china will get delay?
&quot;please do not repost this footage on your end&quot; way to make money from this disaster huh? but then those medias are also making money off of this.. damn humans
Also, I really hope you and your family (as well as many others) are okay Jocelyn 💛
This 1st Explosion = 3 tonnes TNT equivalent<br>This 2nd = 21 tonnes<br>Hiroshima Atomic Bomb = 15,000 tonnes<br>Nagasaki Atomic Bomb = 20,000 tonnes<br>Tsar Bomba Atomic Bomb = 50.000.000 tonnes<br>Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 &#39;s largest fragment impact on Jupiter = 6.000.000.000.000 tonnes<br>Gamma-ray bursts = 2×10^30(2 x 10 with thirty 0 behind) tonnes
That is unbelievable. Poor souls.
That was scary. I&#39;m glad he jumped away from the window, that would of been a bloody mess.
I hope he&#39;s fine
&quot;中國的會爆炸！&quot;
OMG
I heard a kid cry in the background?
this is ridiculous
im glad this guy is fine, geez... my heart goes out to all the people there.
Dam, i remember telling those guys to take their smoke breaks out side the firecracker factory.
Michael Bay went too far this time.......
9.11 = badass!!!
I&#39;m glad the baby is OK, and that he didn&#39;t get hurt very bad.
I find it hard to believe only 50 died.... I betcha it&#39;s in the hundreds if not thousands. I pray that I&#39;m wrong....
holy shit..
ふぁーｗｗｗｗ
I think I would&#39;ve passed out after hearing the windows being smashed down, this is fucking crazy.
oh my ga... wth is happening to china??
やばすぎ
I noticed one thing.  It seems to be the shock wave.  The first two, separate by about 2 seconds, hit the window without breaking it.  And then he ducked, and I am so glad he saw the big one and anticipated to duck under to avoid glasses shattered into him.  In fact, shock wave can break bones and kill.   I am glad he saw it, if the explosion happened during his duck and he got his head up and the wave came, what would happen?   What is the safest practice if you were him?
stay safe man
Can anyone translate what the native was speaking?
Sounds like a lock and load at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=26">0:26</a>. So frightening. The sound is insane. I hope he made it out alive with his child. 
Jocelyn; its impossible not to notice all of those buildings that are much closer than this one.  Is it just me, or is China really not being upfront with how bad this disaster is?  Because it literally looks to me like its taking out a few city blocks instantly.
Population control at its best :0
Jocelyn Wei. Is this your video? I hope your family is safe.
My heart cries for all those who lost Loved-Ones. What a sad and most frightening thing.... I can imagine many may even have thought that the World was coming to an end.... No words... Be safe, be well.... you and your family, loved ones, friends....
god bless all foreigner in tianjin :(
Good luck out there...
this guy knew the last one was going to be big with the window shattering. he got away from that fast
sé que pocos entenderán esto pero mis mas sentido pésame a todos los que perdieron familiares en ese accidente espero pronto todo se recupere para todos
Michael Bay
holy fuck...
Hey buddy, I hope you and the child in the video are okay! Good luck.
only 80 dead people my ass.... China is downplaying the casualties.
miierda! que locura, pobre la gente que estaba cerca
Right before the window explodes, the father very clearly commands, &quot;Move away [from the window]&quot;--very prescient; his instinct and immediate reaction probably saved the life of his family standing next to him.
are they ok and his child??? this brought tears
this will be on natgeo&#39;s Seconds from Disaster, now really, i&#39;m srry for all these people
this will be on natgeo&#39;s Seconds from Disaster, now really, i&#39;m srry for all these people
Jeeeee-sssuuuusss
This is probably the biggest and most violent accidental explosion I&#39;ve ever seen captured on video. You could have seen the explosion from space! <a href="http://image.slidesharecdn.com/tianjinexplosion812-150813163137-lva1-app6891/95/tianjin-explosion-812-4-638.jpg?cb=1439520140">http://image.slidesharecdn.com/tianjinexplosion812-150813163137-lva1-app6891/95/tianjin-explosion-812-4-638.jpg?cb=1439520140</a>
ALAAAAHU AKHBAR!!!
I just hear him go on omg then he ducked and the window shattered the wind blows in and I went OMG OMG OMG
Tragic. My condolences to those who lost their lives and everyone who was impacted.
Oh…
uh... is China ok
Rejoice! 50 dog abusers are no more. The poor quality of just about everything constructed in China will see more of them perish. Fantastic!
快点回复我们吧 are you ok?
wow what movies is this, it looks so real! you know it wasn&#39;t directed by michael bay
holy fuck..
The projectile that hit the window was going faster than the speed of sound.
hope this guy and his family got out alive. you could hear his kid in the background. can&#39;t imagine how scary this must be.
:&#39;&#39;&#39;((((((((((
Unbelievable.... why would you shoot this vertical?
Holy shit that&#39;s horrifying
Excellent reflexes/reaction to move away from the window as soon as he saw the big explosion, he really didn&#39;t have much time to take cover. Probably 1km away.<br><br>Thing about explosions like this is that we don&#39;t know they&#39;re about to happen, we just see &quot;Oh that&#39;s a big fire, oh that&#39;s an explosion,&quot; without knowing how bad it&#39;s about to become.<br><br>I fear for the lives of the people residing so close to the explosion.
damn, hope he and the family are OK...
pray for them all all the ones I  front of the devastating  blast
I&#39;m happy he knew to duck and cover from the shockwave... What a horrible thing to happen!
Holy FUCK
Don&#39;t worry according to state run cctv all the toxic chemicals from the explosion will not affect Beijing, they&#39;ll just float away into the Yellow Sea were theres totally not a peninsula I repeat no peninsula <br>But seriously heart goes out to all victims
that would have been scary as shit to be the guy recording. hope he&#39;s alright
That is just scary! RIP to all those who died.
It&#39;s one thing to see it from far away, but this is just devastating just to watch so close up. Wow!
thank god for his quick reaction
wwwttffff!!!
OH SHIT WTF
Bet noone in China saw this video. welcome to internet censorship. They just called this a new shopping mall under construction... nothing to see here everyone.. all is well.
Wow! Are you and your baby fine?
So scary! :(
Michael bay logic
Michael bay logic
Why did it sound like he was loading a shotgun at around the 26-second mark?
Hope they were okay. :(
The cunts at BBC did it, it was an inside job of isis from the obama administration
LO LEE FUK!
Heads up move after the second explosion.
OMG._.
Respect to everyone who spent their lives saving people...
But in other breaking news Kylie Jenner bought a bunny rabbit and named it Bruce!!!
Y de repente un comentario en español aparece.
Talking about China, I don&#39;t like them for Xinjiang, but in that case, let share the pains with them. I hope we can&#39;t see more thing like this again.
<b>allahu akbar 10/10 allahu akbar</b>
I was like- &quot;Oh look, theres a fire!&quot; And then I was like- &quot;Oh.&quot;
Awesome power! Glad they&#39;re ok.
Does anyone knows how many people died or injured?
NOT THE WINDOW!!!!!! SAY IT AINT SO!!!
all the time im thinking get the fuck away from the window!!! Im glad theyre ok.
omg poor people , this world is fucked up bro damn poor guys
Michael Bay approves this
holy shit....... sounds very painful.... praying for all those people who was trying to stop the fire...
holy fuck he made such a good call running away from the window in the end, it was fucking shattered
Firefighters :(
whoa... what episode of DBZ is this?? no but on all seriousness this is unacceptable. I feel bad for those who are injured or those who have list people because of this negligence.
the last word he said is &quot;go to the bathroom&quot;
when stupid people don&#39;t do their job:
when stupid people don&#39;t do their job:
I can&#39;t understand why people shoot video in the portrait position. It&#39;s epidemic.
That looks really scary. At first it just looked like a fire in faraway place then the following explosion really unexpected, that was scary. I&#39;m glad he and his baby were okay.
its like a nuclear war..
He said it was terrible now and let his families away form the window to the restroom after the last explosion…
DAAAAAAAAMMN
More soul searching for China, again...
At least this guy was smart to get out of the way when he saw the bigger explosion. Some people would still be recording and only react once the shockwave hit them.
You don&#39;t have to tell us his name, just tell us when he recovers completely. I&#39;d like to know that this man survived completely.
Jesus christ, Im glad hes allright...some of the footage of this explosion is insane....The fuck happened?
20 tons of tnt explosion <br>now imagine an atomic bomb
Distance from explosion: aprox 1,029 metres. If you want to know, just multiply the seconds of delaying between flash and explosion sound by 343,2 (metres per second. That is the speed of sound).
At first I thought... That window&#39;s not broken.  But then...  Big Exprosion!
The ones I&#39;ve seen for the second explosion is sort of like how thunder and lightning is in the sense that you saw it come a light first and then a few seconds after you heard that terrifying sound, thoughts to those involved and hopefully those who were affected can get their lives re built.
Glad your friend is ok. This is terrible. :(
damn!  That looked terrifying at :46 when you see the blinds being blown by the fiery wind!
that shock wave came way too late
Wonder if the window would have broken if he didn&#39;t close it?<br><br>Or does that not matter in this case?
ach du scheise...........
I think he is prob a English teacher or or have lots of people speaking English in his workplace or watched a lot of English movie, I don&#39;t see that&#39;s a surprising thing that he spoke English here.... And no matter what he said, he was just terrified. I Could only image wtf happened.
Hope you and your family are ok. Were you injured?
Saskatoon
Ахуеть!!
i think when all these horrible things happen accidentally. terrorist starts tap dancing out of happiness
Stay safe, jesus fuck I&#39;d be surprised if the death toll is lower than 3 digits.
God ? What god ?
tianjin explosion broken window
Joseph Joestar.
I feel really sorry for those people, but the power of such an explosion is just damn impressive.
wow scary, two explosions? and the second broke the galss... wow
This is absolutely terrifying.
Could have been a much better video if he rotated his phone to the proper orientation first.
are you alright?
Dose he cock a gun at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=25">0:25</a>
no :c
Translation:<br><br>&quot;OMG OH SHIT OMG , GET AWAY ! GET AWAY!  &quot;<br><br>(children crying)<br><br>OMG this is serious , WALK AWAY ! <br><br>(blast wave busted the window)<br><br>GO TO THE BATHROOM !<br><br>I hope this man and his family are safe.
OH MAI GOD<br>OH SHID
Jesus fuck this is terrifying.
looks like action movie imho
What exploded there??
What the heck is that plant using that much sodium cyanide for?
Lets start a Tianjin  Foundation..... ´´Tianjin....The Gift That  Just Keeps on Giving ´´
best footage by far, excellent for disaster response teams to study to understand the scope and scale of some of the accidents that can happen in port cities.
Thanks for the footage. It&#39;s fascinating. Hope the guy recovers from his glass injuries.
omgggg
R.I.P
If the japanese had cameraphone when the nukes exploded. I think it would look like this. Scary..
BOOM~
автор попадёт в АД за вертикальную съёмку
I hope they don&#39;t keep their nuclear arsenal around heavy populated areas
holy shit this has to be video of the year
damn....
Stop USA
WTF
transcript:<br><br>Oh my god... oh shit - oh my god - <br><br>Stand aside! Stand aside! Oh my god. Oh my god.<br><br>[baby cries in the distance]<br><br>This time it&#39;s serious. Run!<br><br>[windows shattering]<br><br>To the bathroom!
a chinese guy saying &quot;oh my god..&quot; etc
Judgement Day
Don&#39;t know what the bigger tragedy is here. The explosion or people still not knowing how to hold their camera phones. -.-
holy shit thats intense! i feel for all the people, its really tragic =(
Hiroshima was 750 times more powerful just to put the atom bomb in perspective.. kina
OMG !  I fear for this family :(
Can&#39;t imagine wtf was going through this dudes mind.... hope you&#39;re all ok!
scared shit out of me.
thank you for sharing this with us.
Godzilla?
I&#39;m under the impression that you reacted quickly after the 2nd explosion, just in time to avoid the broken glasses
That&#39;s what u get for pearl harbor
Funny how he is Chinese but yells Oh My God
Oh wow this video, this guy had a clear view... that&#39;s terrifying, especially that second explosion.
Hope no one got hurt at you :S
whoa. I was not expecting english
what kind of explosive did that? it was some ammonium perclorate ? TNT?
That was like a mini atomic bomb. holy shit.
Omy straight out of a movie
AMERICA, I didn&#39;t know that you were dropping ATOM BOMBS on innocent civilians again!
holy shit
Holy shit, I thought the first explosion in this video was the second big one I saw in the other videos. I&#39;m glad the guy filming was smart enough to get away from the windows before the sonic wave got there.
Is a gas station or factory or what?
At the end of the video he said “head to the washroom”. I guess they should be fine but many others are not so lucky. Hope everything is gonna be  fine.
everything explodes in china
HO MY GOD ~
I hope the man who took the video and his family are ok.
Chinese businessmen don&#39;t care about safety
don&#39;t worry, only few people die according to official report
ha, that&#39;s the shockwave following after good thing the cameraman realize it.
This was the first video where I&#39;ve seen people actually get away from the fucking window. <br><br>10/10 for this mans common sense.
It&#39;s amazing to see the responses in the comments section. People have become so morbid and disconnected with the feelings and experiences of fellow humans... to the point where the main aspect of the video is completely disregarded, and the fucking idiots find unrelated things to talk about in an effort to gain some attention for being stupid and uncaring... Its not cool, and your day of horror will come, and you not will find dumb shit to talk about on that day.
Smart and fast guy, he saved himself from a rain of shattered glass.
I nearly shit myself watching that.  I can only imagine the people in the area.
So ein Feuerball, Jungee
cooool
I hope you were safe! God bless your family
&quot;Oh shit&quot; and &quot;Oh my god&quot; are universal apparently LOL
((((((；ﾟДﾟ))))))ｶﾞｸｶﾞｸﾌﾞﾙﾌﾞﾙ
r u ok ? god bless you naka .
Damn man.. That is terrible. Hope they got out ok =/
Jesus, i hope you fine man... Bless
There were two explosions? Damn.
holy shit, its like in a warzone
what&#39;s he saying right about the end of the video?
This is just terrifying ... +Jocelyn Wei , if You are also the author, and not only the uploader. I&#39;m glad You made it far enough to upload the vid. It means You made it out alive. Hope the kid is fine to.
An explosion is no excuse for filming shit vertically.
Oh my gah!
WTF!!!!
This is a horrible tragedy! I hope baby is ok!?
Quick reflexes
That was a good, quick reaction. You may have just saved your life. Wishing all our brothers and sisters in China well.
pray for tienjin
The way the dad tells his kid to &quot;go to the bathroom&quot; in the last few seconds of footage sounded exactly like my parents when they were scolding me as a kid. It was probably some order to take cover, but out of context, it was rather comical
That was awesome !!!!
oh my god. oh shit. <br><br>lol
This has inspired Michael Bay for his next film.
What a epic reaction from this guy , he saw explosion ... ddnt drop to the ground but belted it towards his baby. By the looks of that window .. he saved its life.
Holy shit. For a split second you can see the room he was just in just self destructing. Thank god he got out alive
Seems like something out of the Cloverfield movie
Xinhua News said the first explosion was equivalent to 3 tons of TNT, and the second, 21 tons (the one that shattered the window).
God thanks that light is faster than sound and the horrible wave. So they still had the chance to go in a save position.
If this happened to me, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do. Very relieved to hear the man speak at the end of the video. I hope he and the child are safe.<br><br>This explosion is terrifying.
Nightmarish
oh mah gah
Thats really sad man.. i hope you are all okay
That is why kids you do not have 22 tons of explosive in a goddamn city.
I think the last line in this video is the father telling his family to go hide in the bathroom. Makes sense as that is usually the most sturdy part of the house.
jesus. I hope he&#39;s ok. I heard a baby in the background too.
Why Chinese man yelling &quot;Oh My God!&quot;? <br>The God for Chinese is &quot;money&quot; so is that mean &quot;Oh My Money!&quot;?
G-d be with them.
Вот какого Хуя Мина стоять и ждать, когда тебя убьет осколками стекла?
Shit was so fucked up he was speaking English.
Smart guy.
Holy shit... ;(
impressive video<br>Oo
:&#39;( i hope this family will be ok,, and i hear his baby cry :&#39;( <br>and for all the people there be strong,, god will help you,, and we are can pray for you.
holy shit
HOLY SHIT!! WTF WAS THAT?!<br>My prayers to the people of Tianjin
Hope you&#39;re alright bro.
Omg! Wow!!!!
This video has been sponsored by Taco Bell.
Holy shit looks like it&#39;s taken straight from a apocalypse/war movie
Fucking rip
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=32">0:32</a> glass looks like a gummy bear
God bless their souls
OMGGG SO HARD :OOO
great reaction
Oh damn... Poor guys
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=42">0:42</a><br><br>&quot;GET AWAY!&quot;
I hope you&#39;re okay!!!
Made in China.
COOL!
Omg, my wishes go out to you and everyone else who was caught in that blast! So tragic and heartbreaking. Please stay safe!
dis nigga knew when to take cover
21 tons of glass breaker
Unregulated factory, poor wages, less security = accidents
God Bless.
Hope you and your family are ok Jocelyn. That was terrifying.
Hi Jocelyn. Glad to hear your friend is ok. I&#39;m a french journalist (I work for a news website called Francetv info). Is there any way I could contact your friend to ask him a few questions ? You can contact me here or at louis.boy[at]<a href="http://francetv.fr">francetv.fr</a>. Thanks a lot in advance.
if possible, could send me a message or call me at anytime 186-2293-0972 really looking forward to your reply.
Hi, this is Archie from the Reuters China, May I ask you a question that did you friend shoot this video? could he or she provide this video for Reuters? I am looking forward to your reply.
Professional tip. Do not stand near windows when any explosion errupts, the shockwave is always coming. Also, cover your ears and keep you mouth open, this was a tatic used by soilders to avoid bursting their ear drums.
That&#39;s super scary
Explosions 101 DON&#39;T STAND NEAR THE WINDOW
whoa dude
glad to hear him speak at the end of the video, wow
This is insane! Please stay safe.
I hope everyone is ok.<br>That&#39;s tragic, very horryfying.
Jesus! I hope your buddy is alright, man. I&#39;m glad that he was really intelligent and ducked away from the windows when he saw that second blast. Any word on whether or not he and his family are going to be alright?
wow, that&#39;s absolutely terrifying
I would get the fuck out of there. Chemicals in the air are reactive to water and can cause more explosions. Apparently there&#39;s a rain forecast too ...
Holy shit. You sound like you are alright. I hope you are alright.
That&#39;s horrifying.
Holy fuck, that&#39;s why you don&#39;t transport explosives near cities.
This is beautiful
Hope your family is fine!<br>Really good reaction on immediately  taking cover after you visually noticed the second explosion!
What the fuck. I thought the first one was already the bigger one... But holy shit, that was a joke compared to the second. This is just tragic.
holy shit with headphones...
So weird that I just watched Fearless and now the city from the movie is all over the news.
Hope you and your family are ok
Holy shit!
smart move running from the window after the second one
I really hope him and his family are alright. That is terrifying straight to the bone.
OH MA GOD fuck that, hope you are safe
Damn...
Shiiiiiet ! :O
Bricks would be shat.
really glad this guy and his family are okay
That was really good reaction. If was just 5 seconds late he would has glass embedded in his face.
Truly horrific. I&#39;m staying updated on the explosion through reddit and this is just the scariest video yet.
Man, hearing that kids cry slightly in the background...the &quot;teddy bears&quot;[?] in the window.  As a father it just hits me.<br><br>I really hope there were not a lot of deaths, or horrible injuries...though it seems so far that has not been the case.  I hope good will and fortune find them after this.
I hope your friend is okay. This looks absolutely terrifying.
Any idea on the cause yet?
Damn! It&#39;s one thing to watch on YT, but it&#39;s a whole different thing to see it right in front of you like that. Hope he&#39;s okay.
Best footage I&#39;ve seen so far <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7FXeaahRsg&amp;t=265">4:25</a>AM UTC
All those poor people... D,:
