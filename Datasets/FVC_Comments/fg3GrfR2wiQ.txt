And<br>NO GOOD COP CAN EVER BE A BAD COP AND WERE THE Bstrds For Asking for TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY !
Why is it people can&#39;t film for crap
Have fun in prison for the next 20 years.
omg how is this not murder
I wish that he could have killed all of them
DONT RUN FROM THE FUCKING COPS!!!!! stupid asses
Not going to try and revive him? Why not use pepper spray or taser
Not looking back hands not reaching. I don‚Äôt see the threat
Murder.
Didn&#39;t know broken taillight was a capital crime punishable by death.
<b><i>Search: BREAKING: Cop Sentenced to 20 Years Because a Good Samaritan Filmed Him Murder a Man</i></b><br><br><br>Because a vigilant citizen took out their phone and filmed the police, killer cop, Michael Slager will spend the next 20 years in prison for murdering Walter Scott. By Matt Agorist -  December 7, 2017
The guy that filmed this a real hero. Thanks.
How does someome who just got shot 10 times put there hands behind there back, i fuckin hate this cop right here, hes telling him to put his hands behind his back...how?????? You fuckin idiot hes dead
This is clear murder, if tables was turn and you murdered a cop like that you would get the death penality no questions ask, this cop today only got 20 years for this murder,  he shouldve gotten life of the chair period!!!!!
This is America! This is freedom! not the totalitarian Kremlen! Liberals...see this video!
why the fuck doz  he need to shoot a full clip why not just 2 shots or even just shoot him in the lag  why in the chest
How are cops trained to deal with somebody fleeing on foot? Obviously a stupid decision by Walter Scott, should not have cost him his life, but how could this cop ever assume deadly force was the answer here?
Just coming across this! Eight (8 for christsakes) deliberately aimed shots into the back, at a guy who couldn&#39;t possibly have been any kind of threat to him before or even when the shots were fired!! <br>I&#39;m also amazed that a jury couldn&#39;t agree on a verdict in his first murder trial! Despite this video, plus his out-and-out lies in his report, a stupidly dumb jury couldn&#39;t find him guilty! Something really smells around this case, and the smell is emanating from this officer and his partner-in-crime (who also lied in HIS report!!) This has cost the State $6+ million in damages so far, yet, the murderer remains un-convicted!! Truly unbelievable!!
How did this go from him being traffic stopped to them being in a park..why the hell was he running away and how did this get out of the car? Did he jump out after he was stopped. Why was this man fleeing? I look on the wiki. All it talks about is the guy is a coast guard and was studying. Nothing about him having outstanding warrents and shit like that. The internet is clearly avading the truth.
He should not have run. Simple.
Asshole cops. They keep getting away with so much.  Then they wonder why society hates them.
Cool
he ran. scuffled with cop and grabbed tazer and threw it. i would have been scared too. cop acted appropriately.
Mistrial.  Holy fucking hell.
So what if he gets away, you win some and lose some. Guess the cop didn&#39;t feel like running that day! But, you¬†don&#39;t have to be a badass to shoot a man in the back, where I come from they call that being a coward. You just have to be arrogant enough to think he&#39;s got no business running to start with and add a heaping scoop of a psycho cop on top and you have Walter Scott dead on the ground. The scary thing is up until a couple of years ago this is the kind of incident that would have landed this cop a big metal and citation.
no tazer? ?? just kill a man for running? you had his car! WTF
Murder is Murder<br>And That <br>was Murder!!!!!
Nice and clean.
pew pew pew!
Fuck this bullshit he guilty and needs to be convicted.
Clear case of 5 year rookie simply over reacted to late and fucked up big time. He probably wished he called out sick that day. But the root of the whole scenario is the colored guy didn&#39;t follow basic instruction especially after serving our country what was he thinking.......
Where&#39;s the blood?  A bullet hole in the t shirt maybe?  Anything?
Do what the cop asks. Then be on your way. Inconvenienced or not.
Should people run from the cops? No. Does that warrant death? No. From a psychological standpoint people naturally have a &quot;fight or flight&quot; response to fear. He was scared so he ran away. Was he completely innocent? I&#39;m sure he wasn&#39;t or he wouldn&#39;t have had such a reaction. Does that mean some guy with a badge and suit and gun gets to play judge and jury and executer all in one? No. Scott was murdered. Slater got off on mistrial by 1 juror. He will be convicted next trial. I believe that.
unloads multiple shots into your back then tells your dead corpse to put its hand behind its back. Holy shit where to begin.
I have a few glocks myself. That officer unloaded like I do when I want to waste my bullets. Then hurries back to pick up and plant the taser. May you burn in hell piggie!
1. Slow to 0.25x speed<br>2. Make sure quality is at least 480p<br>3. Go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=91">1:31</a> and watch Slager&#39;s right hand
I sencerly doubt that a cop, who shoots a guy in the back, would seriously LET THE WITNESS TO THE MURDER, who is literally only about 30 feet away in clear view of the cop, get away before calling another cop. I also seriously doubt that neither of those two cops didn&#39;t fucking see the guy filming them in broad day light while the worked with a dead body. There is no way this is entirely real. Plus, even if you were thirty feet away, a gun shot would not sound like a couple of <b>pops</b>, the mic on his phone would&#39;ve cut out during the shots. Plus, the dude filming is a terrible camera man. The cop and the victim both leave the frame numerous times during the video. Saying that he plants his tazer there with the body without a clear view of the action is just total crap. The guy also doesn&#39;t start filming until after the guy starts to run. There was definitely more going on than a black dude running from a cop and getting shot in the back.
what was dropped on the ground at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=17">0:17</a> ? Anything of importance to the situation? If that wasn&#39;t a gun or a knife, this cops gun didn&#39;t even have a reason to be out.
They are going to let this cop go!  CNN just reported 15 mins ago that the jury cannot reach a consensus on the shooting and Slager&#39;s guilt.
u can clearly hear the taser going off. cop had burn marks on shirt. prob thought suspect still had weapon. i say not guilty. if scott cooperates this never happens. since when did the criminals get to be victims.
Disliking this video just makes it harder to find, people are retarded.
wow, how can this be?
see him drop the taser by the dead guy&#39;s side??? framed?  cop is a murderer.
He really had no reason to shoot him..Honestly he was probably too lazy to chase him but wanted him so bad he shoot him..I think that&#39;s most logical.
I&#39;ve just watched this video for the first time cause I&#39;ve just read that the officer testified that he feared for his life as the suspect charged at him with a taser ..... after seeing this I hope he gets life.P.S. I&#39;m¬†not an American
they need to hang that fucking cop by his nuts.
This murderer will stand before his creator and answer for this.<br>This was murder.
I saw this video once before, but here I am watching it again after apparently in the news they are in the process of selecting jurors. Okay, Michael Slager can catch all the charges they throw at him, including the $750,000 fine and the life sentence. Why would you shoot a man running away from you? In the show COPS, they never show any of those guys shooting the presumed criminals who run away. Shady logic, I know, but think about it...all those episodes with car chases, foot chases, and the like, I can&#39;t say I have seen one episode where a cop shot a guy in the back while running away. That was just a dirty move...
This happend on remount rd by auto parts i was at la tapatia when i heard gunshots
that was so cold. look at how he shot down a human who was running for his life. how could you claim you were scared from a man who was clearly running away from you?
I&#39;m from Charleston and this really disturbs me. PLEASE EVERYONE STOP THE VIOLENCE!  NO MORE KILLING AND SPARE THE UNJUST. NO ONE DESERVES TO BE SHOT AND KILLED IN COLD BLOOD. THINK OF YOURS BEFORE YOU PULL THE TRIGGER. SHOW SOME COMPASSION FOR LIFE AND THOSE YOU LOVE. PLEASE! WE&#39;RE DIEING BY THE NUMBERS! RIP WALTER SCOTT

FUCK THE POLICE
i hope that cop rots , absouletly disgusting man , that man dies y becuz he ran AWAY from u , my prayers r with his family üò≠üò†üòßüëè
Lmao the cop report said he feared for his life because the victim charged at him when we all clearly see he was running away from the cop lol... im telling yall without this footage the.cop would have got away.. keep a camera always
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=23">0:23</a> it was at this moment the cop knew he fucked up..(he looked straight at the camera)
The guy is running from you, and how is he treat.   Even if so shoot him once in the bottom of the leg.    Mr. Slager did not know he was being filmed.   I think he knew exactly what he was doing, he is far to calm and composed and he sims high with his gun, he would have known this could hit key organs ie. heart, lungs.
Mr. Slager is a psychopathic he showed no emotion at all zero.    There are many professional, caring, good officers I bleive most are... but there are some whom however somehow get past police screening Slager  is one such person.   I pray the judge finds him guilty.    RIP Walter Scott the poor soul ran because he was scared, Slager gives me the creeps there is something very disturbing about him.
Film the police!
evil
when they say freeze in SC they mean it white or black they will shoot u in the back when u get that tigle in the back u better stop drop and roll
surprised he didn&#39;t attempt to shoot the guy recording.<br>hell, i&#39;m surprised police aren&#39;t massacring innocents.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23protectandserve">#protectandserve</a>
It appears that this is one cop who deserves to be executed.
Terrible, why didn&#39;t he chase him? Also, how do you fear for your life, when the person is running AWAY from you?
I don&#39;t like everything the BlackLivesMatter Movement does but this shit right here justifies the creation of the group. I don&#39;t care how many good cops there are, they cannot bitch about anti cop feeling when this is going on. But they endorse a guy like Trump. Instead of tackling the problem that some of them are psychopaths, they want to pretend they are under attack. Please. It&#39;s the black community &amp; other minorities who are under attack.
wooooooow what in the actual fuck did I just see.
THIS IS MURDER. And this cop is at home awaiting trial. Unbelievable country we live in. If you&#39;re a cop reading this you are a¬†sociopath. 99% of you are socio&#39;s.
Walter needed a strapless, hands free camera of his own that day.
We have just witnessed a mans life extinguished for what?
how often does this happen where there is no video and the officer walks?<br><br>(not to say that they won&#39;t find some mumbo jumbo excuse to let him walk in the end anyways)
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7........8.
Loved seeing that robbing animal go down. Shoulda taken him in alive, burned him, castratd him, waterboarded him, and slowly beheaded him with a dull knife. Then put his beheaded head on the news so black people learn to follow the rules.
that cop needs to go in 25 to life
Ok two qesitens one why do cops always shoot the black people? and two why do cops never shoot the white people? If you have the answer please tell me in the replince!
I want everyboy to listen this rap music from N.W.A &quot;FUCK THA POLICE&quot;
Never resist arrest, just dont
Power hungry cop got mad because the man grabbed his taser out of his hand and removed the policeman&#39;s power over him, so he decided to execute him for it.
I support Law Enforcement, however this Guy, I don&#39;t. Shoots a guy running away from him in back.....smh.....poor decision on his part. You just can&#39;t do that.
FUCKING MURDERER!
Hey assholes not all cops are like this,use your heads you ignorant peasants
Ok, two things. Why do they always shoot to kill? A bullet in the thigh would stop almost anyone. Also, what&#39;s this thing with cuffing obviously dead people?
LOL People can&#39;t tell this is fake? How stupid are people Jesus Christ. This is just propaganda!!
Scoot was a former policeman he should have known not to run but he didn&#39;t expect the cop to shoot him, that just sucks
I just don&#39;t understand I guess he should not have shot the guy and he should have been thrown in jail but why are all these people hatin on cops
as slow as he was running you&#39;re telling me a trained officer couldn&#39;t catch that dude?
I have to say it, (homeland security kiss my ass) we need to start shooting back in situations like this. I don&#39;t give a Fuck that the government is reading this, if a cop unjustly shoots a man in front of me I will do everything in my power to<br>&quot;stop&quot; them. <br>&quot;an eye for an eye&quot;
Don&#39;t blame cops, that guy fought the cop and ran away there is no one to blame but the guy who got shot, the cop was doing his job.
Notice how no one protested this? But they protested that piece of filth Ferguson thug?
Shooting a man because is running away... I suppose you are fat enough to feel imposible to run or give any step. That seems to feel that you probably should be fired from the police force. For taking care of the public safety you should be fit and reach this goals like every other human is ordered for. <br><br>Instead of that the only thing you know to do is to shot an defenseless human?? And you shot to him 8 times??? INCREDIBLE<br><br><br>American people is fucking sick.
The most important YouTube footage ever shown. Thank you YouTube.
fucking scumbag cop needs to die. or get raped in prison.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=120">2:00</a> he picks up his taser after he conveniently placed there after running at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=60">1:00</a> to go get it. all it takes is 60 seconds for a cop to set things up
dude... dudeeeee
<b>Gets shot multiple times in the back while running away</b><br><b>&quot;Hands behind your back!&quot; You&#39;re such a threat!</b>
why handcuff him at this point, he&#39;s dead  if not dying
His family just reached a $.6.5 settlement with the North Charleston County. Is that&#39;s the price of life?
Yeah, he just murdered a man.
BLACK LIVES DONT MATTER!!!
It&#39;s real in sc
Man good thing that guy with the phone cam got the angle right at the very second he did. otherwise this cop would have gone free for sure.
Corn dogs for the pickings
why was he handcuffed after being shot like 6 times?
shouldn&#39;t be running from the cops... good shooting though
gotta give it to the black guy he could sure dance when he was getting shot.
Were is the smoke and recoil of the gun
looks fake as fuck to me
Fake
This cameraman should be ashamed of his horrendous camerawork.
Why did he run away in the first place
What have we learned today kids? If you abide the law and don&#39;t resist arrest then you don&#39;t end up in a grave, I bet that so called angel Michael Brown pulled off the same crap
Not to belittle the obvious horror, but if he had held the phone vertically the video would not have shown the whole scene. <br>HOLD IT HORIZONTAL
why are people even putting themselves in such a position to be killed by a corrupt police officer? breaking the law, resisting arrest, attacking police officers, talk about stupid people to even put themselves in such a vulnerable situation
do cops not chase and tackle people anymore? They just shoot them now?
they took down the bryce williams shooting but keep this up? what does this mean youtube?
I agree, but until the mentality changes inside of the police department I&#39;m afraid we will always have incidents like this. This is a very deep rooted issue with these kind of officers. Believe it or not this is what their departments seek after... only when things like this happen and it hits public the police command acts as if they know nothing. From the recruiting process through the rest of these racist police officers careers they are taught and trained to look at at African Americans as their lives don&#39;t matter. Until we addressed one of the biggest problems in America which is racism, departments will continue to breed  and traing police officers like this on our tax dollars. All I have to say, just think God for cell phones!
Jimmy, I first take objection with your first statement, &quot;if your a cop&quot;. Sir, I&#39;ve been on the job for over 23 years from Ohio to Florida. I&#39;ve ¬†been a certified police officer in three different states. That would be Ohio, Georgia, and Florida and I can tell you in 23 years that&#39;s not a true statement. That if someone gets shot with a 40 caliber it would knock him off his feet. I&#39;ve seen suspects to officers get shot and not always does a 40 caliber or any caliber have a dramatic effect as to knock someone off their feet, that‚Äôs hollywood. But my friend I will tell you what has a dramatic effect is that I know that there&#39;s a dead citizen laying on the ground that was not armed and that was not fighting the officer or try to hurt the Officer or anyone at the time of the shooting. The dramatic effect was that this officer murdered this young man for simply running away. Where is the CPR that should have been performed after the shooting that were trained in the Academy. There were no other immediate threats around. ¬†Why didn&#39;t the officers administer CPR to this gentleman. You can suggest it‚Äôs a trick video or the color of the shirt seems different but what you can‚Äôt say is a trick is that that guy is DEAD, and DEAD is FOREVER! However, I will tell you this my friend this is one of two things racism, stupidity or even probably worse both‚Ä¶ either way this former idiot is where he is suppose to be, in JAIL! This video is sickening every time I see it, and in no way represents law enforcement in today&#39;s society.
Cops are publicly executing citizens and the ones that are always preaching less government try to justify it.
Walk It Off Mann..
Thank you Obama Bitch and Bush for this crazy cops
i like cops and im related to one the reason they shoot is because of all this kill the police shit i mean if someone said to you kill you and your family because you brother killed someone wouldnt that make you scared.
He died instantly? Where was he shot i don&#39;t see any bullet holes in his shirt. I didnt see any bullet hit him.
Why would you run away from a cop?
FAKE people. It&#39;s fucking FAKE.....
Imagine if it had been a white Harvard professor who ran away from the cop...do you think the cop would&#39;ve shot him? No. Cops see poor blacks as expendable and they figure they don&#39;t have very many legal resources.
Some cops arnt like this, but some are stupid and dont know how to handle situations...they panic
The guys had a tazer pointed it at the cop the guy turned around threw it and ran the cop shot him becuase he was a threat the cop picked up the tazer put it next to the body which is  foul evidence 
Still completely unbelievable to see this even though I see it all the time on the news. I truly don&#39;t believe this will stop ,but only get more frequent. Too bad it wasn&#39;t the camera man that got shot I do believe the guy that lost his life would have had the balls to film the evidence a little bit better
Good cop or bad cop ? I still dont like cops
I&#39;ve always thought that this incident didn&#39;t make sense. ¬†This video is odd...
I just don&#39;t understand why innocent people keep trying to run away from the police.
I hope you go to hell
8 shots. I only hope he lived.  Poor kid. 
Such an Ashole why are cops feel like they are god 
You get a perfect view of his back at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=23">0:23</a> as he hits the floor, a perfect view of a clean shirt that looks like it just came out of the dryer. Where&#39;s the blood at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=161">2:41</a> when the officer lifts up his shirt. How do you get shot 5 times, 4 times in the back area and there&#39;s no blood? How does he record this without the police officer saying anything to him while he&#39;s standing right there? Since when does a police officer stay shut while they are being recorded especially in a situation like this and on top of that the guy recording him was black. The cop &#39;&#39;supposedly&#39;&#39; just shot a guy in the back so what makes you think that he&#39;s thinking about your rights while you are recording this right in his face? Get the F out of here

This is so fake. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Wich ashole voted this Video positive this guy is dead do you think thats cool<br>
Every time I see this, I keep thinking about the South park episode with Uncle Jim Bob. &quot;It&#39;s coming right for us!!&quot;
This shit is too fake
I am a self employeed, educated, tactful mother of 1 son who excels and is supported in every worthy goal he aspires to. He is on elementary and has been harrassed, so have I. No record, law abiding I am. I&#39;ve been cuffed and placed in the bk of a squad car after the car I was a passenger in flipped over 5x, ran off road by a drunk driver. B.S.
Wow!  That&#39;s so sad. This man was running away.  Eight shots are you kidding me? And am i the only one who noticed the cops partner was black?  And not only was he black but he seemed to be perfectly fine with what his partner did and didn&#39;t try to perform any form of cpr to the victim. I honestly think sometimes this isn&#39;t so much a race thing as it is a police brutality thing. Some of these cops have these power trips.  They think they are God. Probably bullies in high school who amounted to nothing and  are now pissed at the world.  Who knows. Glad he is charged with murder Cuz that&#39;s exactly what this was
That guy should have stayed in his car. He caused his own death. But 8 shots? Yeah something needs to be done about that officer. But still Scott caused this. I&#39;m black and I have Zero sympathy for his stupidity.
Enjoy your time in prison and eventually hell. For your sake, hopefully sooner rather than later.
Soooooooooo FAKE!!!!
Damn this cop shot this lowlife, from the back this cop is a coward. 
Can you smell that?
The real issue is pussys become cops
zzzzz... fake... agenda. out
Do not let media fools you with so many conjectures like hate crime, church of God, Loving people are dying, fight between black and white, gun control law, and so many other conjectures. Yet, find only one church that they are worshipping God Alone. There is none! Black churches are worshipping a name does not even exists. Look at Bible in Aramaic language, there is no name Jesus in there. Yet, all of these so called churches are worshiping a fake name and crucifying that name every day. The consequences are black people being killed by police and no power can do anything about it. Look at the Bible belt area who are worshipping a fake man and the consequences are those tornadoes and twisters every year, but they do not get their lesson. This world belongs to the Almighty God the only Creator. He created nature and His Angles brings those tornadoes down although He gives us many years of respite in order stop idolizing those prophets. If you do not follow His house rules, you are going to get hit by His disasters. But, He is a loving God and gives us 40 years respite. Therefore, whoever dies before the age of 40 will make it to His Heaven, while the rest are suffering. That was how the Almighty Creator took away Dr. Martin Luther king before the age of 41 in order to save him from falling in to the unforgivable sin of &quot;Idol Worship&quot;. Because, the Almighty was aware of Dr. King&#39;s innermost soul. Do not let media rape your heart and soul. Look for the untouched message of the Almighty God. The message they should give you is &quot;Worship God Alone, stop idolizing the dead saints and prophets if you want to save yourselves.&quot; Otherwise, wait for more none stop disasters.
If you&#39;re a cop you know people can be shot in the body once and then¬†pull a gun on you, Next thing you know...bam you&#39;re dead. This cop did his job, it might look questionable but if you know the job description this is it. Good job officer, you make the world a safer place; I thank you.
The police can be corrupt as hell in all parts of the world.
I hope everyone take turns fucking him in the prison showers and his partner should be bend over right the fuck next to him in prison too, for lying for this scumbag.
I wish I was that officer! I&#39;d aim for his knees lol
American cops are so fucking trigger happy. Why isn&#39;t serious combat training required?
He coulda use his tazer gun I hope they give death row to this cop racist shit 
Thats why all cops kills innocent people why can&#39;t they leave us alone... hate them soo much foreal 
I was reading this today, &quot;Scarlett Wilson, solicitor for the Ninth Judicial Circuit, told a news conference that the video alone wasn&#39;t enough evidence for the grand jury indictment.<br><br>Footage leads to murder charges, rekindles debate about the right to record.<br>&quot;Just because you have video in this case, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the be-all and end-all,&quot; she said.&quot;<br><br>What a stupid bitch! It&#39;s a major part though. We have police car cams, cop body cams, surveillance cameras all around us in society?
What are they doing trying to plant drugs or a weapon on him? He better get life for this. The cops in the U.S. are out of control.
i hate cops, most of them are sadistic
You were a brave man to take this video. Especially before the second policeman arrived. ¬†If it were not for you taking and then releasing this video, I doubt if the former officer would have been indicted.
Hands behind your back?  He&#39;s dead man he can&#39;t hear you.  I thought he was going to shoot the camera man. 
heres a genius thought:<br><br>when a police officer is trying to arrest you, dont struggle, dont reach for his taser, and for the love of god dont run!<br><br>i know guys, im fucking brilliant. try it next time, its a sure way to not get shot like this man.<br><br><br>that being said my heart goes out to him in his family, may he rest in peace
Pig was just changed with murder
In america officers first kill you then tells you to put your hand behind your back hahahahaahha its like a comedy movie or something its so fucking retarded i can get a gun and shoot black men too why are they called police<br>
Wheres the blood? And why are they happy to &#39;plant&#39; a gun on a suspect in front of someone very clearly filming them? Also this isn&#39;t camera phone quality, so was someone just strolling by with a video recorder? Even the behaviour doesn&#39;t seem natural. I&#39;m pretty sure i wouldn&#39;t keep as cool as this guy if I saw someone get shot 8 times, the camera keep relatively still, and he stays pretty silent. Another very strange video.
I&#39;ve actually realized there has been so many innocent deaths in america caused by police by shooting unarmed people especially black the black people shooting is the majority and police are the big threat in america and need to calm down and the government is just worse!
Wow
Wow
I&#39;m so mad after watching this. I can understand the riots.
Fuck the police man! We dont need cops! The thugs can control the government just fine.

A LOT OF THE COPS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN SC STILL GO BY THAT GOOD OLE BOY MENTALITY CODE. I GUESS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD JUST BE ANOTHER ROUTINE COVER UP. JUST MEKS ME WONDER HOW MANY MUST OF BEEN DONE AND NOT CAUGHT ON CAMERA.
wow he wasn&#39;t even running that fast...fuck
I am not usually on the side of the criminal because he obviously did something wrong , but he was slowly wrong away.... taze him , tackle him , anything. If you are extremely scared and think he has a weapon which he obviously didn&#39;t, then shoot him once in the foot or something. not 50 times in the back wth
These guys aren&#39;t even paying attention to the fact that they&#39;re being filmed. People like this cop have been watching too many movies.
Don&#39;t really want to live in a country where a cop can kill an unarmed man by unloading a magazine into him as he runs away.
And why is that sound from a  cop car computer on this man phone.... This ain&#39;t right
I remember seeing on TV that he planted a taser, I ain&#39;t see it in this video..... It was only one video footage, this shit don&#39;t add up
Why was he running in the first place???
Dude ate 7 bullets before he collapsed tho. Crazy
this is pure, ignorant bullshit. that cop deserves to rot in hell for that stupid shit. 
That&#39;s bill Paxton&#39;s brother! Twister for life 
You are full of it Rick.
Check out the message in a rough stylee<br>The real criminals are the C O P
The thing I find weirdest about this is the cops don&#39;t even acknowledge they are being filmed.<br><br>Usually they yell at everyone around them.
Stupid ass cop
Now that&#39;s a damn shame! ! Now why did him shoot him?
its getting fn crazy, the cops should all be polygraphed to see if they are racist. This shit needs to stop.
I like how everybody is talking about the cops killing a guy but not talk about the who recorded and not try to help at all
Michael Thomas Slager is a hero!!!!!!!!! Stop being racist against him just because he&#39;s white.
It&#39;s fake!!! being shot at that range with a .45 would drop his ass fast. Furthermore theirs¬† no blood on the victim what so ever that round would make his back into Swiss cheese.
yeah fuck the black guy trying to fight over the gun that had nothing to do with any of it.. if he would have succeeded in taking it away the cop would be dead..
What&#39;s gotten into to this world...smh
Love to see cops in jail when they get butt fucked for the first time
I wonder if it is ever possible to get away with killing a cop in self defense probably not
thank got this guy&#39;s in jail and on his way to prison
it really does look very fishy . its like someone said action and youre right he got shot 8 times and it looked like he was unnaffected. very strange indeed. all of these false flag operations going on makes me wonder. The media has definitely been trying to fuel racial tensions.
Thank god for cell phones
America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between.<br>It is also the only country where you handcuff a dead body !<br>It is the only country where you call a false flag a terror attack and where you fabricate¬† real terrorism in others countries and you call that a &quot;revolution&quot;<br>This is also the only country which will wipe out an entire¬† country supposedly to bring &quot;democracy&quot; while all their politicians are puppets of NWO and cousins of cousins : Bush, Cheney, Obama, Rodham. *<br>America has been at war 222 out of 239 years. And only count open war, no mention of proxies wars and CIA wars ...<br>And you think you are blessed by God for doing such horrors all over the world ?
cop should be executed the same way he killed unarmed man
Is this a fakse flag?<br>Do to others as you&#39;ll love to have done for your self
That real
Is this fake? It looks like it is
Monster Cop here should get life in prison with no chance of parole. First degree murder like this caught on video really should get the death penalty, no question about it, but we all know that will never happen, I doubt he even gets 20yrs.
I&#39;m one to respect the position of a cop, But i don&#39;t trust anyone that has a weapon. That badge means shit when the person wearing it pull a gun on you. He had no right to shoot a man in the back.
Cop: DON&#39;T RUN, I AM YOUR FRIEND!
it&#39;s a hoax.
OK, I see where the person that shot the video is now claiming copyright ownership and will be enforcing it. It is suspected that he will be asking up to $10,000 licensing fee.
That was awesome! Lol
some guys dont want nothing to do with cops,<br>some cops however disagree.. what will he say in court.<br>cant be what he said over the radio.
You know whats really weird about this video.. the way the cam spins for 10 secs at the beginning.. then the cam focuses in, and action! the guy starts running, and then gets shot at. it just looks weird. But maybe not.
His no ordinary cop his the judge, jury,&amp; executioner, his merciless, ruthless,  cold hearted he&#39;ll shoot you on your back if you try to run from..THE PUNISHER 
look at it this way when you are in prison and you make a run for the fence what do they do white or black they shoot you
This is horrible... I wish I didn&#39;t see it or the young dude with the camera. Unload a clip? Cop is indeed a criminal. 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fuck">#fuck</a> 12 
Shoots guy 8 times... &quot;Put your hands behind your back now&quot;
Looks like the new kid is about to get assgaped in general population.
Murder, planting evidence, this fuckin&#39; guy is textbook cop material!!!
Usually I&#39;d defend a cop, but this is absolutely wrong. Don&#39;t say they need better training because they can&#39;t make a training for every single cop to where the police are oblivious that the situation is fake. But that gives him no right to kill a man that was running at less than a mile per hour, fuck this cop for putting bad looks on police 
I live in South Carolina....... I better watch my back (no pun intended)
see how people want this to be racial by posting that it&#39;s a black man who got shot?

People think this is REAL?! LOL
Nothing will happen to the cop.  There are 1000&#39;s of videos online showing cops killing persons that are running away or like in NYC sitting down getting a hair cut or being choked to death as they say I can&#39;t take in air.  The upper middle class up to the rich and wealthiest people, need poor and lower class people to be cops to keep the rest of us from demanding justice and equality , to keep us from hurting, killing, revolting against the upper middle classes and wealthy. That is why cops make so much money, have crazy benefits with very little to no education.  But most important cops have a different set of laws that govern their actions and the courts and prosecutor look the other way when cops commit crimes even kill, steal, rape, sell drugs... At worst cops and all law enforcement persons are allow to resign, so they can become cops in another town and keep their fat pensions and life time health insurance and tax breaks and law breaking get out of jail cards badge and gun.  Even the law suits are paid by us the tax payers, cops never pay for their criminal behavior.   And it no longer about being white, black or brown, it&#39;s about being poor, working poor, lower class, lower middle class.  Against the cops that protect that upper classes.
is this what police is now, all the time i hear more and more stories of trigger happy officers who shoot black people for no fucking reason, and why is it only in amarica i hear theese things?? Get ur shit together Amarica, ure the best fucking country evar, stop looking like sheit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=18">0:18</a> the black man throws a gun at the officer, realizing he can&#39;t possibly shoot the officer because he forgot to buy bullets for his gun he stole. The gun lands at the officer&#39;s feet and skids past him about 4-6 feet. The black man then tries to run away after assaulting the hero officer. The officer&#39;s life was in danger too because the criminal already had a gun and could have had another gun or weapon on him still. The officer is a hero. And I&#39;d know because I&#39;d be the first to call out unjust police, but the facts are in and this criminal thug was in the wrong and violent. He just raped a woman and murdered her prior to this confrontation as well =/
I feel policemen are getting a bad rap. Some of these crack head, pimping, armed robbing, good for nothing criminals¬† are a menace to society.
why did the guy run from the cop?
Obama brought me here. anyone else!
Good on the guy who actually recorded it, he&#39;s pretty brave... Who knows what a sick cop like that would do next... I don&#39;t know if I would&#39;ve had the balls to keep getting up closer... Watta go camera dude
This is why I celebrate every time a cop gets shot and killed. You all think they are here to serve and protect, when they really don&#39;t give a crap about you. Police are there to investigate and charge people after the fact, sometimes they get lucky, which is what you see plastered all over the tv, some &quot;heroes&quot;,
Why can&#39;t they just say unarmed man?...
This cop just needs¬†to be locked up and the key thrown away!¬† This makes me so sick, I wish I wasn&#39;t human!¬† To hunt someone down like some rabid animal, I&#39;m just lost for words!
Yooooo 9 shoots tha fk. 3 more he would of empty it. I am stunned, i mean the man turn around, unarmed. Pretty sure the cop didn&#39;t feel running geee let me clock him down with 8 shoot no wait one more, 9, to make sure. Then tazed???? Tha heck man!!!!!. Trying to revive him with electric shocks as a defibrillator. 
That&#39;s a POS officer 
Wow okay this is the worst ive seen by far...god help us all.
dickhead dope cop is standing there like, what happened, what do i do now.
the video guy is lucky the copes didn&#39;t shoot¬† him and take his phone
America develop a lot mind blowing technologies, lots of scientiest, ¬†but not a webshooters is invented for capturing suspected criminals, and use real guns instead, let alone stun guns
Did the guy die
Is this really trained officer , because the safest place is infront of his gun<br>while he is shooting , 8 shots , really ?!
&quot; Try being a BLACK person all your life then you&#39;ll see this could happen any day in your life , a simple traffic stop could result in death yeah you&#39;re laughing now but you won&#39;t think it&#39;s so funny when your ass is in the crosshairs &quot;
<b>TRUTH</b> A COP WILL NOT ARREST ANOTHER COP OR STOP A BEATING OR MURDER. IT DOESNT  HAPPEN EVER. THEY ARE ALL BAD. THE JOB ATTRACTS THE BAD OR ONLY THE BAD GET HIRED<br>
ALL POLICE WHO KILL AND LIE AND TAMPER WITH A CRIME SCENE  DESERVE TO BE SHOT! THATS MY 2 CENTS
how come every time some one is there to film something like this, they shake the camera around like they have parkinson&#39;s disease?
i like how he says &quot;put your hands behind your back&quot; after he shot him in the back
Finally got the smoking gun evidence, literally, fucking disgusting!
Its not about Race.. Cops in general are out of control... STOP THE MILITARIZATION OF THE U.S. POLICE

I LAUGH SO HARD AND DO A HAPPY DANCE WHEN I TURN ON THE NEWS AND A COP DIES.......66% OF THEM ARE CROCKED RACIST ALCOHOLIC DRUG ADDICTS THAT WILL SHOOT YOU IN A HEARTBEAT AND LIE TO COVER IT UP......ITS ALL OVER YOUTUBE POLICE BRUTIALTY..........FUCK THE POLICE MAY YOU ALL BURN IN HELL..... AFTER GETTING SHOT IN BACK OF THE HEAD BY A METH HEAD......PIGS MAKE ME SICK.
Ugh. Just...Ugh. Cops are monsters, is all I have to say. They frame and kill innocent people. Imagine how many other people have been killed and framed without being caught on camera.
Fucking bitch planted taser on him.
The only defense is to pop a pig like George Hitcho in Pa.¬† Hitcho may be on death row but at least he put a fascist pig in the ground first.
This nigga really ran back for the taser to frame the dead guy but could&#39;ve easily picked it up and tased him when he was running 1 mph smh
oh my god.
Ethnic cleansing works. This summer you see more emphasis places on executing Black male children between the ages of 6 and 14. With the elimination of that age group, the larger Black community will vanish within a generation. African American families letting very small children outdoors to play should know, the Police will murder them at the first opportunity.
This is terrible that a person had to die over a routine traffic stop.
Thats what all this law enforcement agencies are hiring with all this Analytical and formality psychopaths, murderers and sick M***therF***ers abusers because they gun and badge.

Y in the history of the world would someone do such a horrible thing to a man u dont know or admire its just sad and i hope that man gets justice 
look i know what the cop did was wrong. People also keep saying he planted evidence but the truth is he just tampered with evidence. I cant say what the cop did was right but think, he ran, not once, but twice( he ran from his car in another video). they were both wrong and neither would have happened if they both did the right thing.
AGAINST FUCKING COPS USED YOUR GLOCK G 27
Kendrick Lamar - Blacker the Berry. Hypocrite.
Social engineering. 
Sad
This is incredibly dad and unexcusable. How in the hell do u shoot someone for running away??? My god the man was 50 and running slow. So sad the man lost his life and that cop clearly has no care for human life. Smh
Couldn&#39;t he just run after him? He was pretty darn close and slow. If that cop hadnt been out of shape and his backup even MORE out of shape maybe they would&#39;ve caught him. (Instead of that lazy gun aiming that should&#39;ve only touched his legs)
I have watched this video like.... about 50 times now... According to the actual reports... this man was shot 3 times in the back once in the ¬†butt and once in the ear. Ok...... the report also says.. this cop used a FORTY FIVE caliber gun. one shot.. in your back from a 45 from THAT distance would almost certainly knock you on your ASS. Not to mention tear a big ass hole in you. But.... 5 hits??? I mean... I just cant see any blood....Maybe Im wrong.. maybe im not looking at this video right.... but.. I dont see any blood.. even when the other cop pulls the guys shirt up.... I mean.. ¬†3 hits in his back from a 45 from that distance.. I would think his shirt would have to be SOAKED in blood.....
I masturbated to this.....
This is how it is in Mexico. USA is becoming like mexico now. Here the police are part of the cartel.
I think anonymous or somebody should start finding out where all these officers who do this fucked up shit live at and posting to the internet so the officers have to either keep moving or are no longer safe at their residences. If the people work together we can easily end this madness through the simple use of information.
Where&#39;s the blood? He was shot 5 times?
did look like he was trying to grab something off the cop but a shot to the leg woulda been enough. Off loading a whole clip is just redic. The world needs less violence and its all in our state of mind! Laws of attraction are very real. Negative breeds negative and positive breeds positive! Pretty simple laws.
Didn&#39;t the officer see the person filming? ¬†He or she seems to&#39;ve been standing in direct view.
Dirty Harry¬†wasn&#39;t this dirty!
Was anybody hanging from that noose? No comparison to this shit.
Too much Power was given to Law inforcement agencies after 9 / 11 ... But  I got a feeling that¬† some of this is going change here pretty soon , because the public is tired of these shootings¬† &amp; invasion of basic rights at Inland border stops....Que . no people
He forgot to sprinkle cocaine over the body before he cuffed him.
Question: ¬†What are officers suppose to do when a suspect is running away? ¬†In this day and age, what <i>is</i> the proper protocol?
 This so messed up!! Really put your hands behind your back...I&#39;m all about justice but I don&#39;t see a threat when thick dude is running away
Damnn dats crazy why?? That cop should do life in prison first dd<br>Degree murder
The cop was dead wrong in this shooting, for sure. Bad decisions all the way. Charged with murder, right call. But one should never compare all shootings the same, till all the facts are in, lynch ¬†mob mentality is wrong. And bad media hype is wrong. That being said we all need to make better decisions in life. Love as Jesus does, and remember God is watching over all of us and are hearts. So the decisions we make are up to us and we will be judged ¬†in what do, in the end. So have a good heart and soul.
fucking pigs... I wanna see a video where police get the shit kicked out of them by some kids they&#39;re harassing or something.... I&#39;d favourite that shit
Hey, please don&#39;t pay attention to these racist trolls on the web, they don&#39;t even deserve a reaction, lol,...we know this shit was dead wrong.
LMAO
Cops should patrol in pairs 1 black 1 white. Black cops for black people white cops for white people. That way race can never be an issue. 
I feel sorry for both families. This act will add fuel to an already out of control fire. Let&#39;s hope there will be justice for both parties in the near future.
I&#39;d first like to say that I am a white male, a teenager for that matter. I watched this video and i wept for him and his family. This country is so ass backwards it makes me want to throw up. We are a white supremacist country face it or not. This country will fall all because of a skin color. If we do not rise up and end racism, it will be the end of life as we know it in America. Every single white person I know is slightly racist, crossing the street when they see a black person coming. This country makes me sick. There was a man who was formally racist and he made a video saying why we white people are racist. ITS BECAUSE WERE SCARED. We&#39;re scared that black people will rise up and take away the benefits that we gave ourselves when we started enslaving you guys. White people are in my opinion PUSSIES. Anyone white person who disagrees with me deserves to be rid from this country, it is obviously better without racist little shits like yourselves. Fuck America, white people made it go to shit. I&#39;m moving to Canada or the U.K cause this land mass is run by fucking retards who employ retards to keep it safe.
i don&#39;t care that the officer&#39;s white, the felon black, armed unarmed doesn&#39;t matter. but for an officer to load 8 shots into a man who&#39;s fleeing with his back to him is not the right choice of action here
I live in North Carolina and the cop was charged for murdered and probaly be sent to prison for life and most likely killed by a black man that is on death row and has nothing to live for. Justice was served! Yes, im white, but this was just wrong this is what causes problems for blacks and whites.
Fake please worst act yet
Can this idiot hold a camera straight?
He looked over his shoulder then walked 
If u run from the cops regardless of race u should be shoot. PERIOD. 
Cops war on us: https://youtu.be/U9NHBkjFJT8
This man didn&#39;t deserve to die. However, before we know it Liberals will be handing out¬† medals to people who resist cops. Had this guy not run he would be alive,
This is SO fucked up! You end a mans life because he ran from you!!????? Cops are so fucking stupid. Fuck them all. Put a bullet in this murderers head
Funny every time and I&#39;m black 
Gotta like the way the donut eating cop throws the cuffs on a dead guy, what a loser.
Seems fake,  To turn the races against each other.  Don&#39;t be fooled,  we all bleed the same blood at the end of the day.  
Dude, this had nothing to do with race. The guy in the video assaulted the officer and tried to take his taser he then ran and resisted arrest. The guy in the video said abuse, really. If anyone was abused it was the officer, he was the one getting attacked. He doesn&#39;t deserve time in prison. Also he died from gunshot wounds not a heart attack, stop going on about the CPR stuff.
Shot how many times?¬† and no blood.¬†¬† I call HOAX and shame on the ones who did such a lousy job to try to get us to believe it.¬† Race bating again.<br>No blood on shirt, or on officers gloves that is handling the &quot;body&quot;.¬† Wake up people.
He had no right to shoot that man no right at all 
disgusting
Sadly theres probably a proud white man happy about this scenario. 
Ok first of all the guy should have never struggled with the officer trying to take his tazer which you can clearly see happen the take off running after a struggle like that your going to get shot 100% of the time and your an idiot to think other wise. Funny the autopsy report doesn&#39;t show if this man was completely shit faced drunk or high on some type of drug cause who the hell in there right mind would do that and risk getting shot and killed? So in my opinion the cop did what he had to do the man attacked and ran he wasn&#39;t sure what weapons he may have or try to harm him again so he took action to subdue him. And when it comes down to going home to your family at night and seeing your loved ones or dying at the hands of a criminal I would do whatever it takes to protect my lives and those of the innocent which that day that man was not. 
He got pulled ova his light on his car ye he might of been a criminal but innocent until proven guilty and that&#39;s wot I say he shoulda hand cuffed him straight away anyway he didn&#39;t ave to shoot him he want running fast either he could of easily caught him he shot him on purpose in my eyes hope he rots in jail!!!
Rot in Hell, cop.
Jim lahey that&#39;s so bad ur out of order and sick u need to get a life poor man got shot for running away hope that officer never gets out oh by the way I&#39;m white!!!!
INNOCENT people don&#39;t RUN.¬†<br><br>No license.<br>No insurance.<br>Four kids and over seven grand in arrears.<br>Juicy rap sheet.<br>Runs<br>Wrestles with cop.<br>Runs again.<br>Shot dead.<br><br>I&#39;m NOT seeing a problem here.<br><br>WHO the fuck is stupid enough to keep defending the DREGS of SOCIETY?¬†<br>stupid much
Why white people gotta do this shit all the time?
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=33">0:33</a> you can see that the tree has a fence inside of it. Crazy how a tree can grow with a fence inside of it.
Horrible!!!! Rip!!!!
He didnt even run away.  He just jogged away calmy. Coo could easily run and tackle him or call for back up and follow him but no. Trigger happy cop. Plus did it really need 8 shots? 
Sick bastard shot him cos the colour of his skin and racial stereotype and what have you. good thing it was caught on camera, now his badge isnt gona save his ignorant ass. but still he prolly got a few jail free cards cos his white and a civil servant.
That fucking cop is coward he shot a man in the back that&#39;s worst cop ever he can&#39;t restrain a man he was a unarmed man .He makes the uniform look bad it&#39;s wrong I&#39;m very sad because that wasn&#39;t needed you can get someone with out a bullet or call ahead of you can&#39;t get someone there was a cop ahead of him I wear a uniform I&#39;m not very proud of it write know that was a young life he took I was very sad when I sew it lots of tears.
Horrible scene Damn shot in the back so many times .... Traffic stop...unarmed colored man <br>Thankful someone had a camera phone to capture the very horrible crime by a police officer<br>He should be put in regular population 
Terrible. ..
Assassino.
Indignante, quitar una vida, a sangre fr√≠a, por la espalda, que dios este contigo. Del poli..., que ley caiga sobre ti
America is ¬†the most dangerous place for a black man to live in right now.
Eta, @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=20">0:20</a>, you can see the perp grab at the 5&#39;oclock position on his waistband. Obviously, it was nothing. But at the time I&#39;m going to assume the officer thought he was going for a weapon. Add the fact that he ran in the first place and he then assaulted the officer. He&#39;ll get off unfortunately.
You&#39;re all a bunch of fucking morons. No one can truly know what happened before the officer pulled his trigger because the footage doesn&#39;t show us.<br><br>Not every incident involving a black person is a &#39;hate crime&#39;, so start to look at the facts of situations and not the colour of those involved for sympathy, it&#39;s pathetic.<br><br>The media conglomerates only add to the title &quot;Shoots Black Man&quot; because they know it will gain publicity and enrage the black masses. This way the black people see white people as oppressive, and white people see black people as criminals. It&#39;s all forced hegemonic ideologies that are set out by the media to create controversy and publicity, to get to the final stage of increasing profit.<br><br>The sad thing is that the media institutions get away with this, because all of you lack the common sense to think for yourself and get spoon fed a bunch of stereotypical bullshit. You&#39;re all puppets. Stop fighting each other over pointless race war and start to look at the real issues.
I&#39;m sorry but now I got to study this video. It has fake written all over it. If you got shot 8 times, there should be a lot of blood, that&#39;s common sense. But there wasn&#39;t any trace of blood on his clothes and none that&#39;s even show that he was shot or any holes in shirt to  even show that he was shot. I&#39;m not falling for this, this is fake and the way he fell down at the last bullet didn&#39;t make any sense. I say at least when he got shot the third time he should of fell. 
If you look at it closely when the man is running, before the cop fires the first shot, he puts his hand in front of him near his waist band. I bet you the cop thought he was pulling a weapon out as he was running and decided to use lethal force. The cop did not have the viewing angle that the camera man had.
Why did he put the hand cuffs on him?
Cold blooded murder
it just amazes me wen I watch these videos and read people comments on how they try to justify that this man was guilty and deserved what he got...but then I watch videos on how a cop kills someones aggressive dog and every comment is how much they want to kill this cop and beat his ass...but its ok to shot someone eight times...wtf.. I need to move to a different world 
Yes this cop make a mistake and he deserves a punishment. I don&#39;t know if he did this because he hates black people or just because he has no idea what he&#39;s doing. This does not mean that all cops are dirty. Police Officers are protectors within the state and most offices take that role honorably. Keep in mind that 93% of African Americans that are murdered are murdered by other African Americans 
From CBS:¬†Slager has been fired from the police and charged with murder. END OF THE STORY!!!!<br>Therefore the comments &quot;black VS white cops, white cops will always get away&quot;or &quot;it&#39;s not a murder&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s legal&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s staged&quot; and all the racist comments have been very useless. Somewhat justice does exist in the USA.<br>Now the next white cop will think twice before shooting at someone who doesn&#39;t represent an immediate danger, either he/she&#39;s white, black, yellow or green.
So lets see evading arrest resisting arrest and then disarming a police officer¬†<br><br>wait wait I know he didn&#39;t do nothing
Why are we having so many problems with black people and the law maybe they should go educate themselves I don&#39;t see Mexicans or asians getting in trouble like this all the time no wonder people hate blacks.
whats the purpose of handcuffing unarmed person who has been shot 8 or more times???
Cricket police
How can people put such horrible comments about this innocent man ur all sick if that was someone in ur family u would want justice too but because it&#39;s not ur families u don&#39;t care out of order to all u heartless people out there!!!!
That officer deserves all he gets he took a innocent mans life ova a taillight on his car glad it got recorded cos the officer would of got away with it otherwise he&#39;s a disgusting human being if u ask me life for a life that&#39;s wot I say feel sorry for that poor mans family!!! 
It does look a bit fake to me,but I&#39;m not stupid enough to think it IS.This was a cold blooded murder no doubt and the apologists on here should be ashamed...&#39;he assaulted the officer &#39; ffs ,well the &#39;officer&#39; seemed perfectly ok to me,not exactly struggling for his life is he.
Moral of the story......pay child support.
Fuck you all and the cops.. The guy turned his back. No reason to kill him
The cop lost his job and is being tryd for murder yes this happened it&#39;s about time a cop is being held accountable for his actions 
Hang that cop
Bruh they fukkn sat there and never turned him off his face..
Shoot a man tell him to put his hands behind his back then keep searching him. That&#39;s some useless pigs right there. Can&#39;t wait to see how he makes out in jail little goof troop. Anytime I see a cop doing anhtbjng I pull out my phone and film it. Never know when they are going to MUDER another civilian 
You could make a music video of police shooting unarmed guys in 2015
fuck me that was straight up murder. and one lazy cop
Police brutality<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KATI0VJmSGs">https://youtu.be/KATI0VJmSGs</a>
Garbage ass pigs!

I hate white cops one cop pulled out his gun on me because i had little shock gun in my pocket when i was just 9 yrs old
That&#39;s clearly murder no way out of that. Sorry for the family. Prayers go out <br>
Fucking bullshit
Number of people who would be outraged if this felon piece of shit who was shot would have been White.........0. ¬†Minutes of television coverage this would have received if the fleeing criminal who was shot was White....0.
This policeman absolutely needs to go to jail. If he somehow gets off I will join Reverend Al in a march- and I hate that race baiter.
Hey who ever filmed this. Watch your back you are a target now. 
It is getting ridiculous. I believe he had the guys name and info available so why not just go to his home with fellow cops and pick him up? If he had to stop him a shot in the ass would have been sufficient. No need to shoot him in the back several times and then cuff him while he was dying. I could have done a better job than that without any training. Well you sure showed him sir.
They were both wrong in this situation. The man should not have run from the cop in the first place and none of this would have happened. However for the cop to pull his gun and shoot him in the back 8 times is anything but justified.
R.I.P. Walter.
He is spending the rest of his life behind bars it was on the news 2 days ago 
call Rev. Al quick!
You real good on cars...... but..... who knows how to fix my 2007 stupid ford f150 to manual transmission? 
Welcome to the police state, everyone.
&quot;Just sprinkle some crack on him and lets get outta here.&quot;
Wen will this shit ever stop we need to start bussing back
No way was that justified.¬† The cop fucked up as bad he possibly could and now he gets to live with his mistake, but his VICTIM doesn&#39;t have that luxury.¬†¬†¬† Throw the cop into general population and let the other inmates do waht they&#39;re going to do.¬† Save the state the time, trouble, and money it takes to put on a show trial.¬†¬†¬† I am very pro-law enforcement,¬†¬† as long as it&#39;s GOOD law enforcement.¬†¬†¬† This was a murder, caught on camera.¬†¬†¬† Nothing less.
What amazed me is that, he shot the guy. Didn&#39;t feel for a pulse or render aid. Instead he walks back to pickup the taser, walk back and try to plant it. This cop acted as if he didn&#39;t care, didn&#39;t show no compassion for a dying man. It appeared the cop no longer saw this guy as a human being but as a piece of trash. ¬†What type of person kills, plant evidence and then falsify report. Not all cops, many cops are just like him. This one just got caught.
youre a SLACKER...SLAGER!!!how many times do you think he herd that?
look at him! he couldnt wait to open fire! i think if he was alone he might have shot the guy taking the video too! and planted weapons on evry body!
I&#39;m pretty sure the whole point of bringing race into every incident is so the media/govt will keep whites and blacks fighting and at each other&#39;s throats. Because this has absolutely nothing to do with race at all. And as long as we keep thinking its racially motivated nothing will change and we will be slowly killed off. It happens to everyone but obviously the highlight is when white police kill blacks and they grab highlight and the race train begins. It shouldn&#39;t be like that. It should be about one individual(not s human in my eyes) taking another mans life for no reason. THAT should be the issue. Not who&#39;s white and who&#39;s black. 
This was the most egregious thing I&#39;ve ever seen by a law enforcement officer.¬†¬† Totally unwarranted and unnecessary.¬†¬†¬† That being said:¬†¬† The Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Brown shooting was justified 1000%.¬†¬† These are night and day different scenarios.¬†¬† I&#39;m glad Mr. Scott&#39;s family has made the choice to keep Al Sharpton away.¬†¬† This cop is a murderer, no doubt.¬† And he will get his.
Mr. Scott dropped something at the Mr. Slagers foot. Mr. Slager after shooting Mr. Scott in the back and killing him went back to retrieve the weapon. He seems to have dropped by accident close to the body as another officer was investigating the body. He quickly picked it back up and holstered it. I don&#39;t know about the rest of you but I believe an officer can shoot a fleeing suspect if he feels the suspect is a danger to others in the area. Which to me he was. It sucks that he had to get shot and killed on camera but he caused that on himself.
I am ussaully not the one to judge cops when this kind of stuff happens but this seems sketchy
Bummer,,,they arrested the cop,<br>I wish they would have waited a few days before arresting the cop.<br>I wanted to get a free big screen tv in the riots!
this is why not every idiot can be a cop or get a gun in germany !
i like this:)
yea that white girl loves his dead bbc
Don&#39;t know why he ran. :/
If it was a black cop who shot a white man, no one would care. If the black guy shot the white cop, no one would care. But when a white cop shoots a black man (who was trying to run away) people freak out 
I&#39;m black and I don&#39;t pull the race card quickly? :/ racist exists everywhere and within everyone.
To me it seems as if this cop was trying to set himself up as a hero only he was videotaped.
What the hell is the cop thinking!! Don&#39;t shoot an unarmed mad fuck
I can see everything, but the most cruel part for me is when he goes and handcuffs the man and not help him live. Just inhuman...how oh how on earth do you handcuff a dying man???
We have existed for over 300,000 how many of those years did we need cops. 
White cop shoots black man- Yeah these news stations know how to be biased dont they.
Murder.... That&#39;s what this was... straight murder.... ¬† That cop was in NO danger from this man running away, he just got tased and was probably disoriented from it... ¬† People will argue the guy shouldn&#39;t have ran BUT he wasn&#39;t a threat regardless... ¬†This was murder
If it wasn&#39;t for this video, that cop would have got an award.
Well, at least the illegal alien with a trailer full of anchor babies got the footage...
Does anyone else see him for one either reach for the officers gun or stun gun? And two reach in his waist band...? 
No need for a long trial, we &#39;ve all seen the evidence, eight shots on target is nothing less than intent to kill. Guilty of murder plus a whole stream of lesser offences relating to the conduct of a police officer.¬† 25 years at least.
omg he got shot hella times
he shot BBC
We see a lot of cops chasing criminals on foot , but we don&#39;t see they shoot at the criminals when chasing them , ...a horrible mistake by the cop , or may be anger was boiling in him so much that really he wanted to kill the fleeing guy
Watch this video very closely many times. Do you see any blood? Do you see any body reactions from getting hit with 9 millimeter rounds? Go watch a ballistic video of what a nine millimeter round does to a watermelon. Now tell me this person was hit with a9 millimeter round and kept running. the second you are shot with a9 millimeter round you would spin around hit the ground and be flailing about with blood everywhere. At least a little bit of blood I&#39;m sure. This video looks set up. The way the guy was running away from the cop seemed lackadaisical and almost like he wanted to stay within the camera&#39;s view. The cop looks at the camera as if to say did you get it? Then the cop starts yelling some nonsense about put your hands behind your back and the suspect does it! Tell me a person who just got shot multiple times is going to put his hands behind his back calmly. there are so many things wrong with this video. More problems than the moon landings.
Yo that&#39;s fuk in crazy man how he shot dat man
you see why fascist pigs are trying to pass laws outlawing you to video cops?
What a shame that&#39;s why cops have a bad rep...  There is that small percentage that are pieces of shit.  And black white or pink Noone deserves to go out like that... Best wishes to the family <br>
just another fat lazy racist cop...¬† and they finally charged one of them with murder?¬† wow.
listen kids you want to live longer dont do stupid shit like running away from cops. the cop is wrong for this but if he had just talked to the officer and not flee from his car none of this would have happened. again when you get pulled over dont panic. stay calm and let the police do thier job. if you got drugs in the car then fuck it you screwed. My condolences to the fam though.
Dumb ass cop
WTF trying to copy N.Y.P.D
I hope this asshole spends the rest of his life in prison. There is a serious fucking problem in this country.
people don&#39;t know how to record üòëüòëüòëüòëüòëüòë
This is so disturbing! The united states is moving closer than ever to being a police state. Marshal law ...etc we need to pray for our men and women in law inforcement, also our military. Shalom
See this is what happens when you give people tons of power and authority over others and a gun <br><br>These are the people meant to be protecting you, Glad to be British where I don&#39;t have to worry about this shit
You dont shoot someone in the back well they are running away(police training 101)! This trigger happy officer clearly killed this man In cold blood, for nothing more then a slight indignation of havin his lil teaser knocked from his hand. Even if the perp took the teaser and ran(he didnt he took it from the cops hand and threw it on the ground as clearly seen in the video) it still does not justify 8 shots in the back. This cop is a coward and obviously a psychopath. He may as well take a plea bargain, if the prosecution even offers. This video played to jury, any jury will definitely end with a death penalty convection for the cop.
That cop is fucking retarded. Not necessarily for shooting the guy (although actually yes) but mostly for the fact that he thinks the guy is still alive or would try to resist after multiple bullets fired at him.
Makes me sick to my stomach. 
The cop is a murderer.  I don&#39;t care what color you are Murder is murder.  I hope this cop gets life in prison. 
Hate to say it but this is another example of had he just done what he was told originally he&#39;d be alive today.¬† He should have stayed in his car and never made a run for it.¬† I wish all cops had gopro style cameras on at all times to record events like this to show what really happened, this man didn&#39;t need to die.¬†This cop made terrible choices that day.
All lives matter not just black or white. All lives. This is saddening but everyone points the race finger.
I feel sick <br>Sickening <br>Beyond words so painful<br>And a pathetic loss of life <br>Words can&#39;t describe the absolute anger helplessness and frustration <br>And even worse knowing it&#39;s not the first or the last time we are go if to bare witness to this travesty 
The cop obviously caught up to Scott after he initially ran from the car. He must have been hit with the taser, which slowed him down. He then proceeded to swat the taser away from the cop and ran again. The cop handled this really bad.
Clearly the cop feared for his life due to the man attempting to circle the globe and attack him from behind.
These fucking cops need to stop shooting people with all that shot he fired that man was gone even if help was on the way they need to stop using their gun like they are hunting deers that&#39;s just fucked up now that cop is on the other side of the law for his stupid fucking move he made shooting that man wrongfully some people are scared they run but you don&#39;t need to shoot at him so many times one bullet to his leg or something but not like he&#39;s an animal that&#39;s fucking wrong 
That was murdering.
Rip. Brother <br>I hope u r in a better place now
mmm thats sad
that&#39;s not ok men!
If the skin colour of these 2 men were switched there wouldn&#39;t b as many ppl screaming over this. White cop shoots back guy= racism and police brutality. Black cop shoots white guy= reasonable force. Human equality at its finest.
This is disturbing - I&#39;m going to shoot, burn and kill cops next week remembering this dick! All in Grand Theft Auto 5 of course.
Thank God this was caught on camera, otherwise, the cop may have gotten away with it.
 <br>I can no longer take this kind of hatred against my own. I made a song to demonstrate how i feel. Please click on my channel and view it. Thanks. Ôªø
That cop is a Caward that&#39;s good is doing life
I&#39;m sorry someone got shot, white or black. I can&#39;t figure why the man would run from the officer.¬† The officer didn&#39;t have reason to shoot from what I could see, No robbery, no rape, no murder in progress, so I would assume just dumping the guy with your side arm was uncalled for. I do believe that Obama and the liberal media is pushing black cases to the front page to suggest we need a national police force to better the system. God if that wouldn&#39;t be a mistake! You watch where it goes from here, They will use this to take more of our rights away and further their all powerful government..
Put that Cop on the Electric Chair! Fuck this guy, he doesn&#39;t deserve to live
It is clear that this man did not deserve to be shot. The cop was so matter of fact and that is scary. I&#39;m pro law enforcement but this is not that. 
Look at the follow up video of the camera in the cop&#39;s car. The guy jumped from his car and ran. Cop is innocent, that fool shouldn&#39;t have ran. There was a warrant for his arrest, he should have just cooperated from the beginning.
Does anybody remember March 3, 1991? That was the day Rodney King who was Un Armed was beaten by 4 Los Angeles police officers &amp; were¬†acquitted of all charges even though the incident was videotaped. Here we are 24 years later with the Walter Scott case with video evidence again and some think it&#39;s still ok for police to beat up &amp; kill un armed black men.
Its like the black police <br>spawned out of no where. O.o
I know this disgraceful cop is saying &quot; these doggone cellphones...I would&#39;ve gotten away like we have been for years&quot; video - more credible witness
I can&#39;t believe what I just seen. It makes me sad....murder!-
wow just what america needed anther police shooting, and the boiling pot boils a little more. it will boil over one day and then what anther civil war. im sorry for anther mother to lose anther son.
It happens alot! Think of all the times this has happened and there was no one there to record it, there has been a belief in policing vs. the black community that all blackmen or at least of of them are of the criminal element, especially in south Carolina. Even in Chicago I was constantly pulled over and illegally search because I drove a BMW! 99% of time these were white officers!
I heard on CNN a video expert said when the video fist plays while its all sideways the he believes they where on the ground wrestling. But the cop new he didn&#39;t take the taser cause after arresting a dead man he ran over picked it up then dropped it in front of the black cop.
Assaulting an officer, gold star, bringing the fleeing felon rule into effect? dead criminal. Its not &#39;moral&#39; its no &#39;right&#39; but it is legal.
I am honestly surprised that the cop didn&#39;t grab the guy with the camera and smash his camera, and then shot him, beat him up, or tase him at the very least. I need to pray or something because this is making me so angry at the Police Incorporated status of this country.
Slow down the video speed to 0.25 and try to look at the very beginning (and when I say very beginning, I mean the VERY BEGINNING). I can barely make out what I&#39;m seeing, but was Mr. Scott on the ground?
What was being said first, and why did he run? Though I`m sure its not, this seems staged, maybe because the video only catches the shooting. I think its¬†a case of though Im not armed, Im resisting arrest. &quot;IF&quot;, ¬†that was the case, I think cops should be able to shoot. We cant have a society where if a cop is going to arrest you, ¬†you can decline as long as your unarmed, its not debatable.¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†If not, and¬†he was complying in every manner, ¬†¬†this cop should be hung from one of those trees instead of some expensive investigation and trial....
Can&#39;t even explain the anger I feel over this,.. Piece of shit human being.. I&#39;d beat the living fucking shit out of him.

I feel safer around gang bangers than these racist pigs, such a shame.
You&#39;re forgetting the black guy tried to take the officers taser. Threatening his life. Black community need to get right and stop being stupid. Cops will kill you 
Wow. That cop is a piece of shit and should face the harshest punishment possible. RIP Walter Scott. My heart goes out to his loved ones and friends.
Who says ISIS is not here in the US yet. RIGHT THERE! ISIS style
I got pulled over recently for doing 83 in a 75 and the first thing I did was put my hands up. When he came to my door I calmly said to him, &quot;I will do whatever you want, please don&#39;t shoot me.&quot;¬†<br>He asked said &quot;What is this a hostage situation?&quot;¬†<br>My response was &quot;No at least I&#39;m a bargaining chip in that situation.&quot;<br>He started getting nervous and asked me to step out of the car, I did so with my hands up moving very slowly. He asked if he could search the car, I agreed. He found nothing in the car. Frustrated he asked me once again, &quot;Why are you so nervous?&quot; I said to him, &quot;All I wan&#39;t to do is make it out of this alive.&quot; He told me to wait in my car. I ended up getting a 200 dollar ticket, with a ride height violation as well.
Wow, I like how this first responder administers first aid......NOT!
Good grouping....
I was listening to Micheal Savage Thursday and a cop called in. The cop said that this cops stance is exactly the stance they take while at the SHOOTING RANGE! And the fact he shot him in the back 8 times, hit him 4 times and then has the nerve to cuff him as he takes his last breath and then proceeds to plant the taser next to the man to make it look like he took his tazer. I&#39;m a white man and this cop should be executed, no questions!
That&#39;s mest up he knew what he did was wrong too late, rest in peace hopefully law do apply to this man usually white people do get away with shit like this.... Is fuck up but true 
Why would this stupid fucking  idiot run? Maybe he was contributing to the danger in that area. You don&#39;t run when a cop stops you, not only does it aggravate the ARMED COP, but it also goes to show you indeed might have something to hide. 
NEITHER of them bothered to even turn his face out of the dirt. Disgraceful!
I don&#39;t know if anyone else was paying attention to the taser falling on the ground after the victim tried to take it from the cop. In the cops eyes the victim took his taser and he didn&#39;t know if he had it or not since he was running away and was not able to see if the victim had the taser on him or not. Ever heard of tunnel vision? That&#39;s probably what happened and the cop never saw the taser hit the floor which you clearly see in the video. He did mess up by moving the taser to where the victim was handcuffed. Plain and simple why would you try to take a taser from a cop? If the cop was tased he would have been left at the mercy of the attacker unable to move or keep control of his own gun for as long as the taser was deployed on him. Im not taking sides but watch the video and try to see what the cop also sees. I guess its hard unless youre in this type of field.
Why would he tase him so close if he wasnt in a struggle. Cop definately deserves punishment, why not go for the knee cap at least. This should be the moment they make vest cams run all shift, nationwide.
why didnt he cooperate with the cop.would he have been shot?think alittle people
This is exactly the kind of thing that is going to help impose a military police system. Which is exactly what the government wants. There has to be law and order. This man was¬†committing a felony by fleeing¬†the officer. Not to mention what other crimes he may have been under arrest for. Its another Rodney King. The bleeding hearts are all the racists who want to stir up their agendas. That man deserved every bullet!
in 2015, can you honestly blame a black person from running from the police?
wow nice camera work soon everyone is going to have a cam on there heads and cars
And now... we wait...
üëπüëπüëπüëπvampire killer bitch copüë∫üë∫üë∫üëΩ
Where¬†are Giuliani, Rush Limbaugh Glen Beck and Fox news? How are they going to justify this one?
Maybe it was a hit, a few years back there was 2 NYPD detectives who moonlighted for a Brooklyn mob boss.¬† Who better then a cop to whack someone!!!!
Truly unbelievable and infuriating.
No Blood???
Wow what a POS shot him the back. I&#39;m not making this about race, this has nothing to do with that. People who try to turn  an incident like this into an excuse to justify a long history of crime can eat shit and die. One thing most of us can agree on is FUCK the police who think they can treat people however they deem fit. They need to be shot in the back.
That guy&#39;s probation officer hasn&#39;t even been born yet....
Damn do officers ever get non lethal takedown trainning??
WTF is wrong with people.  How do you shoot someone in the back, yell at them for you to handcuff them, and then just sit there like nothing bad is going on.  It&#39;s f***ING disgusting.  And I can only hope one day he feels the pain he caused.
How could anybody think this was staged! This bitch ass cop shot for no reason. The tazor gun was appropriate but to kill a man that post no threat is unman kind.  fuck that cop. Pussy ass.  Solitary confinement. 
Murder !!
So now after the dash cam has surfaced, if the cop was able to get out of the payroll car and run the fleeing guy down once, why couldn&#39;t he do it again when the guy was right in front of him? Obviously this cop was sick of this guy making him work more than he felt he should have to, so instead of chasing him again he shot him multiple times in the back because paperwork is easier. 
It&#39;s strange to see comments about this video either being fake OR about the cop being exonerated (or getting away with it in any other form). <br><br>A quick google search will show you that this video is indeed real AND this video led to the officer not only being fired, but also being brought up on charges of murder. 
See the cops body position at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=185">3:05</a> ?<br><br>He&#39;ll be seeing a LOT more of it....:wink:
POS cop, I hope he spends the rest of his life behind bars.That way he will have to worry about his own life, for the rest of his days, never knowing when his attackers are coming, but all the while knowing his number will soon be up.Its cops like him, that give the good ones a bad image.
The BIG question is WHY did the victim RUN?? ¬†Probably a convicted felon who didn&#39;t want to go back to prison.
One question how come the sirens in the background ain&#39;t getting closer, through the filming they seem to be in the same distance?
You know what to see something like this is extremely disturbing... An what is sad is that people seriously are trying to find a way to justify what clearly everyone who sees this footage for what it is MURDER.. Yes cops are here to serve an protect but there are quite a few cops who hide behind their badge an act above the law... He made a choice an his choice was the wrong way in handling this situation. There was no immediate danger geared towards the cop.. An I don&#39;t give a flying fuck if this man was white pink purple or blue there are  statistical facts an studies that have been done in the pass that shows officers handle suspects in a different way when it comes to race... So for those who are tired of hearing that guess what until U can walk in a persons shoes who are already born with a stigma behind them because of their race then I need you to kindly SHUT THE FUCK UP... You sound very ignorant and uneducated.. If U choose to live in denial U have that right... But I live in the real world an no matter what U say or think idgaf if we got a black president or not racism is something that will always be in this country so deal with it.. Now does this situation possibly has something to do with racism maybe maybe not... But I will say this that officer clearly was aware that he fucked up and he was trying to cover his ass. An being that he radioed that his life was in danger an the man tried to grab his taser an then U see him kindly go back an pick up the taser an clearly see him planting it beside the man.. He figured it would be more believable because of the stigma that is attached to black men an their interactions with police.. But what fucked his story up was this footage he wasn&#39;t expecting for this video to be released which debunked every thing he said as to how the series of events took place... SO PLEASE USE UR COMMEN SENSE BEFORE EXPRESSING YOUR OPINION
I fucking hate cops like this or almost any fucking cops
Somebody&#39;s got to weed out these psychopath killers before they get into the police.<br>I hope he gets the death penalty. This is the only thing that will cause these killer cops to think twice.<br>Everybody&#39;s got cameras, now. It&#39;s no longer only the cop&#39;s word against &quot;the perp,&quot; and the cops are often caught planting false evidence on the victim, as in this video.<br>Power to the people!
This piece of shit cop deserves what&#39;s coming to him, and I hope he never sees daylight again. But, I&#39;m not going to talk shit about all cops because of this one murdering fuck!
Im not on either side just facts and my unbiased thoughts.<br><br>Facts:<br>Ok lets start from the top. It started when the police officer pulled over the car in a parking lot, he approached the car, officer slager and walter scot conversed like a normal traffic stop, mr scott said he didnt have insurance, the officer returned to the car and shortly after he returns to his car scott runs away.<br><br>They ran approximately 250yards before the fatal shooting, during the chase a witness says they turned around and had a somewhat of a &quot;tussle&quot;, they continued running and eventually they were both on the ground fighting, during the fight the cop apparently was in control.<br><br>The witness who saw the two men fighting on the ground started to record the shooting, scott runs away, a black object flings behind the two men, the officer pulls his weapons, waits a second or two, than fires 7 consecutive shots, scott was stagering, than the 8th shot was fired and scott fell to the ground, the officer walks to his dying or dead body, handcuffs him, jogs back to where the fight took place, picked up the apparent  dark object, jogged backed to Scott&#39;s corps, and nonshalontly drops the black object near his corps, by than another officer was on scene, he investigates Scott&#39;s corps, than walked away from the cameras view, after that officer slager checks scotts corps and the video ends.<br><br>During the chase and shooting officer slager was talking to dispatch, backup was on its way, after the shooting officer slager said to dispatch, &quot;shots fired! Suspect down, he grabbed my pistol.&quot; <br> <br>Thoughts: <br>Well first of all i just want to say walter scott had no reason to run away from the officer. He would still be alive if he didnt run. However the cop shouldn&#39;t have shot him when he was running and obviously not a threat. He knew he committed murder and tried to cover it up. Now i understand that he was probably scared after the fight but he still should have known not to fire. <br><br>Know here is the big question. Is it race related? I would say yes. All across the US there is a race problem with the Justice Department. I should say ex officer slager was racist because he had prior violent encounters with african americans. But most of the officers that are considered racist arnt what you think. There not good ol&#39; boys who are out to kill african americans, they are more afraid of african americans. They may find routine stops with african americans more threatening. It isnt because they are bad people. It&#39;s because for many years there has been racism all over the us and in the media. We need to have tests on cops bases on racism. We need this to recreate trust between cops and minorities and the us as a whole. If this keeps happening, we could possibly have a failed state when we dont trust the police. We need better cops, more training on how to treat cops, and most importantly establish a mutral trust between police and citizens. <br><br>Now i am not saying cops are bad, or all cops are racist, but the moronity that are has caused a huge divide in the Justice System, and if this continues will cause a failed state.<br><br>I am also aware that this dramatic change will take decades to come, but to make a change we need to put it in the spotlight now if we want to start the long journey into a better society. 
0.38 seconds. Did the police officer just say put your hand behind your back. You ¬†shot him 8 times fucking dumb ass. Officer should get death penalty.
I bet cops have a in-house competition to see how many brown people they killed by ¬†the end of the year. Winner gets gift certificate of favorite donut shop
Ah I&#39;ve had too many Doughnuts today, can&#39;t be bothered to run. Where&#39;s my gun. BAM BAM POP POP BAM. Places taser next to body.
Truly unfortunate¬†to see¬†this man get shot.¬† The video displays an act which was likely unjustifiable on the officers part unless the assailant had a gun himself.¬†¬†¬†One thing I would like to point out (a general comment)... I don&#39;t understand the people¬†who think it is okay to run from the police, assault officers, resist arrest or think it is a good time to pull a bag of chips, wallet or cell phone out of their pocket when they have a gun pointed in their direction.¬† Perhaps a lot of the shootings that have happened in the past¬†could have been prevented if people would: &#39;stop&#39; and &#39;put their hands up&#39; (and keep them there)¬†when instructed to do so.¬† If an officer tells you to do something... DO IT!!!¬† If there is something that you don&#39;t agree with, you can always contest it later.¬†¬†Is it worth risking your life over?¬† Let us not forget that this guy broke the law and was running from the cops... not some innocent guy¬†walking around¬†on a leisurely stroll in the park.¬†¬†That being said, it doesn&#39;t justify the cops actions.¬† Seems like right place, right time for the guy who took the video.¬† Agree with the comment below, &#39;one brave man to keep recording&#39;.¬† Good work!¬† Hope in this case that justice is served.
<br>I&#39;m white but damn....I&#39;m honestly speechless after watching this
Cops like this guy need to be rounded up and locked away. 
America 
The devastating part of this is without this video it would have been business as usual for the Cop. People shouldn&#39;t have to fear the police. I can&#39;t breath!
Rember kids, Its always racist in Carolina.
The problem is simple!! Police officers are given weapons meant to kill!!, Well with our modern technology police should be armed with high tec weapons only!! firearms that record while shooting and why in the world would a police officers side arm be equipped with bullets meant to kill? non lethal bullets should be used, Even if he needs to shoot multiple times a non lethal rubber bullet would stop anybody so a arrest could be made!!
What&#39;s scary is how many times this has happened and not been caught on tape
Doesn&#39;t anyone find it odd that the sounds of the gunshots don&#39;t connect.....    I mean.   If you&#39;ve ever shot ANYTHING...... A hit is a wop.....    Pistol.... Silenced.... Rifle.... Doesn&#39;t matter.....  Aside from a shotgun......   And he would&#39;ve screamed.....   
As slow as he was running he could of tackled the guy and just put him in cuffs. Guess his dumb ass figured bullets would catch him faster
Until the states can hire police officers that know their job and arent bullshit piles of crap. I won&#39;t have any respect for ANY police officer until shit like this stops. 
That cop is a piece of shit.
This is murder in the 1st degree with special circumstances because he is a trained Police officer who should know better, the camera guy is a hero........give him life !!!!
ya just¬† a¬† broken light¬† y¬† did he runn away then
That&#39;s sad
what the cop did is rong but I wonder though the HERO VIDEO¬† GUY<br>The second video offers no evidence of the officer&#39;s claim, although there are gaps between the two clips.gaps¬† huh makes u wonder
So much evidence against this guy he is gonna fry. I bet if he was waring a body cam he wouldnt have shot, planted evidence, or even make the fake dispatch call after he shot him. 
Does anyone think that the people that run from the police are scared?  If you watch the news you should be very afraid.
I can&#39;t believe This!!!!! What the hell are American police officers trained to do ?¬† ¬†What a coward officer ! shoot a man like a dog!!!!!! what a shame !!!!!!!<br>Thank God for the video!!!!
Cops like this, give all the good cops a bad name. He murdered this man in cold blood.
Cant understand why the Cops didn&#39;t look at the witness taking this video!!! They seem oblivious! Witness had to be close in proximity and they don&#39;t seem to notice! Odd to me.
Why didn&#39;t this fool steady his camera at the beginning?
Is that SC police dept using .40 cal or 9mm?¬† Only asking cuz after the first 5 shots he is still running.¬† Does NOT bode well for their choice of¬†caliber.
This is definitive proof that certain cops do in fact shoot unarmed black men in the back &amp; afterwards stage the scene in there favor for the investigation. HOWEVER!!!<br><br>We are a decade in where smart phones with cameras seem to be everywhere. If there are racist cops rampaging everywhere shooting black men unjustly where is all the video footage?
I mean besides the fact that Thomas is a fuck.¬† But as I&#39;m watching this video and Scott is running away, why shoot him?¬† My 9 year old nephew runs faster than that... Thomas could have jogged to catch him...¬† Thomas&#39; actions are just sickening to me...
My dad has been a cop for nearly 30 years and his assessment based on the video is once the suspect breaks free, unarmed, and is no longer an imminent threat to the officer, no shots should be fired. The time to shoot would have been the moment the suspect grabbed the taser.¬†The officer¬†knows who the suspect is and can always pick¬†him up¬†later with a warrant.
I hope this cop burns in jail
Hey ricky notz are you as much trash as the trailer park boy your named after you piece of shit. Too bad that wasnt you
OMG! I respect police officers but to shoot an unarmed man in the back?
The brothers out at Kirkland are HOPING that this white cop comes to their prison.
We&#39;ve seen a lot of these videos recently, and some other incidents may be justifiable, but this is a bad one. A 50 yr old unarmed guy running away ? Whatever his reason was,  He shouldn&#39;t be getting shot, there was no threat to anyone else and from the footage, there was nothing to suggest he was going to be a threat to the public.  the cop in this incident is not fit to be a police officer
Cops are cowards.they hide behind there guns,not there badge.
Even though this was recorded in malice and he clearly tried to only film the shooting.. you can see the cop and suspect struggling with the taser and the taser fly from the struggle. If the cop did not see the taser fly behind him you can&#39;t prove that there was no threat. Thank god for case law. That good cop will be found innocent. FucK anyone who disagrees. 
After shooting the poor guy. He casually walks over to him with out a care in the world, saying put your hands behind your back etc etc. This guy is going to get the book thrown  at him. 
I did not understand your comment , what are you trying to say?
A cop shoots a unarmed person in the back,and he is trained .YouTube should have another category  for videos like this.its not entertainment  when that man&#39;s life was taken from him for no reason.
This is why I never get upset when a cop gets shot.
I seem to recall a time when shooting a man in the back was considered a cheap shot and an act of cowardice.
Entertainment. 
YouTube should be sued,for listing this as intertainment.
i say take this cop and throw him in with the black brothers in a maximum security prison.
I would just like to say sorry for the death of the black man that had been shot by the police ,I may self live in England  uk and shooting of black and white people are on the way down ,the only way to stop shooting of innocent black and white people is to have a good gun control ,USA  needs to have a no gun law and to disarm the police  ,then may be innocent people Black and White need not die ,God Bless you.
P O S cops like this make the good cops look bad, makes every cop look bad.
Murdering ¬†bastard. No wonder some of us laugh when they are taken out.<br>I think its great that he will be frightened every day for the rest of his life.
Killed him and handcuffed him. Sickening. 
I bet no one seen blk cop take out rag or something and handed it too white cop to whip something off look closely as black cop walks up
not one time cop or cops look at this camera guy ??? not ones they glance at him? not once they say stay back ??? wtf
Before Obama was President I would have thought the video was authentic and the officer should be arrested ASAP for outrageously shooting an unarmed man in the back. ¬†But now, after all the lies and scandals and corruption, I don&#39;t know what to believe. ¬†Maybe just like in Fast and Furious this incident was staged so that Obama could escalate his race war. ¬†Or maybe this incident will be a number one story for days in order to deflect public attention away from all the other Obama scandals and lies; who knows. With Obama as President up is down and down is up. ¬†I can tell you that I am not the only one that feels this way.¬†
¬†Hopefully this ex-cop will not get off on some technicality. He had better stay behind bars for the rest of his natural life, or get the death penalty.
then says put your hands behind your back ! like you just shot at him 8 times .. the man is dead .. smh when will this stop . im so scared for the black men in this society. many are saying this has nothing to do with race but cops vs us .. all i can say is fuck the police ! black ,white , hispanic , i just dont like them and what they are standing for. should be protecting us instead of ¬†shooting us dead ¬†and taking all our money!
I found it odd that who ever was filming this didn&#39;t attempt to hold the camera up until after the victim pulled away &amp; try to run.¬† Clearly the victim had a brief tussle w/ the officer &amp; if the victim went for the stun gun what makes you think he wouldn&#39;t have went for the officers gun?¬† Having said all of that, the cop was completely out of line for shooting¬†the victim¬†as many times as he did.¬† I mean, something&#39;s not right w/ all of this...¬†
Hope that pig rots in hell !
And still handcuffs him, smh that&#39;s why there&#39;s so many pig killers 
I want a public execution in the streets for this pig.
MURDER!!..and I&#39;m a white American male by the way!!!
That&#39;s just terrible
N
I think the guy recording the video should of hid the recording. Let that department spin whatever lie they were going to tell and then release it and take them all down.
Idk if I agree with this video or not, Smoking pot has NOTHING to do with Gay Marriage,this is just Isis recruiting for Communism again. Hopefully once Bush is out of the White house we will find Obamas birth certificate. Katrina
the circumstances of this video goes against the actual news reports of what video they have. the victim was in his car and then ran. not in a park.
The cop is going to hell on earth and in the the after life
The people who are agreeing with Ricky Notz Jr, are Ricky Notz Jr. This guy is just being silly.
Why can&#39;t people just NOT resist arrest? If you don&#39;t resist arrest and they find out you did nothing wrong, then you&#39;re free to go! Is it that fucking complicated?
Racism from either side is retarded.¬† It&#39;s always case by case scenario.¬† In this case the cop deserves the death penalty.¬†
What the HELL is wrong with &quot;Whites&quot; &amp;¬† &quot;Blacks&quot;? Seriously? I am asking this question! I thought &quot;WE&quot; were ALL Americans? What side is the racism on now? WHY do we still have ANY of it? HOLY SHIT people we are fighting for our rights, freedoms and what ever your fight is TOGETHER in life these days YET WE (both White &amp; Black) still can&#39;t find common ground with one another. I am SICK TO DEATH of it all. FRY that cop, Take care of the slain mans family and lets get a grip on LIFE TOGETHER once and for all!!! If this keeps up I am defecting to my own little country where everyone is equal. My 2 cents......
This man family deserve justice for what that scumbag did <br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23blackpower">#blackpower</a>‚úäüèø
This was clearly murder,<br>This cop deserves the death penalty.<br>Greetings from Germany
Wow 
I fuckin hate cops so much 
Black cop just stood there?
I wonder what would happen if this was never filmed... I think i know...
I hope¬†he get&#39;s¬†what he deserves¬†for killing a man. No excuse for shooting a suspect in the back because he&#39;s¬†running away from you (unless you know this is a killer and he will kill again if he gets free - which wasn&#39;t the case). Great that someone filmed this so they have good evidence in court. I can see the cop running back to pick up the tazer and places it next to the victim. There&#39;s a difference in¬†letting a guy get away¬†because of a broken tail light on his car¬†or if they knew this guy was¬†a person who¬†was armed and dangerous, and have already killed or molested someone. If they stopped him for a broken tail light, then they knew who he was cause they had his license plate. He wasn&#39;t dangerous, so why not just arrest him the¬†next¬†day on his address?¬†This guy was not a person who deserved to die for what he did.¬†Too many trigger happy cops.<br>I bet the cops have gone through a lot of shit, so many are probably struggling mentaly. Dangerous to have them on the streets with guns then in my opinion. Maybe they should follow up on how the cops are doing mentally every once in a while¬†after they&#39;ve¬†seen a lot of ugly stuff? Or is that to expensive. More expensive than innocent lives? Anyway - can&#39;t shoot a guy in the back who&#39;s clearly¬†not a menace to society. I wonder why he didn&#39;t just run after the suspect. That&#39;s what he should have done. Can&#39;t be a cop if you shoot instead of chase (an unarmed man).
Surprised the green shirt was not turned into a red shirt with so many fired shots.
This cop is so fucking retarded, u shoot a unarmed person 9 damn times then proceeds to handcuff a dead person like rly,!! U gotta be that dumb to do such a thing. Damn police officers. Finally someone gets caught and does not get away with it like every other fucking death by cops
If the jury finds this cop not guilty, I won&#39;t be surprised if a big riot takes place.
Crap, I better fix my tail light.
Oops. Cop didn&#39;t realize there was a camera on him. That one didn&#39;t fly this time. Good luck getting buttfucked in jail.
Cops are lazy, they rather shoot than to chase.
I understand the &quot;murder&quot; charge... But where&#39;s the &quot;tampering with evidence&quot; charge? They always pile up charges on normal crimes... So why not this one?
Only a democrat would believe this video is real...
&quot;Put your hands behind your back&quot; nothing pisses me off more than seeing a cop trying to handcuff a dead body or someones who has been shot.......like where do you think he is going with 8 bullet holes? ~Richard Parker
Another bullshit video to fuck cops in America thst is so fucking fake 
I love how most videos aim to divide the population more. Is there really a need to label it &quot;white officer shoots black man&quot;. Why can&#39;t it be &quot;police officer shoots unarmed man&quot;?.. I know there&#39;s racism out there but the media always tries to pull the race card. ANYWAY, I&#39;m glad this asshole is behind bars.
Looks like something fell from the cops waist? Or the victim grabbed something from the cops waist then threw it?  Looks to me like he was struggling with the cop....Grabbed something off his waist...noticed the cop grabbing his gun...tossed what he had grabbed and ran for his life.  If it was a tazer the cop was justified to pull his gun... but not fire it. But he could of felt like the guy had it still and was running enough distance to turn and fire the tazer.  If that cop was hit by that alleged stolen tazer he would of been over taken.  Still 8 shots fired??? Wtf 
Open season on black men no justice no peace
MURDER. COPS LOVE TO KILL PEOPLE AND DOGS.
I can not adequately express my contempt for this utter bastard. He deserves to be put in &#39;general population&#39; - in uniform.
This cop did very wrong and will be jailed for a long time but lets not paint Scott out as the saint Travon Martin was depicted as. Do you see a car in the video, no because Scott was running to avoid arrest and the cop had to use the taser to control him. Why was saint scott running.¬†He would be alive today if he did not run to avoid arrest.¬†
Stop breaking the law...
I really wish they would have gotten the whole thing on video. It really doesn&#39;t tell the whole story. Too many details weren&#39;t in this. My trust in video taking bystanders has been broken down due to so many half recordings telling half truths. Granted, the cop did make up a false story and all, but why was the guy really running?
Something about this seems very fake/staged. <br><br>NOT SAYING IT IS but it definitely feels that way. 
Did Scott really take his stun gun? I mean have they scanned any fingerprints on it?
IM SURPRISE THE COP DIDNT THREATEN to arrest the one taking the video for &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; u know how they do. cops, most crooked people on earth! and least the criminals dont front to &quot;serve and protect&quot;
this cop should get the &quot;firing sqaud&quot; after they sentence him to DIE!!! REAlnesss!!!
lazy donut eating fat fuck piece of shit cop. just fucking tackle him and arrest him.
If this is real, this police officer should never get a job anywere again.
That poor guy on the ground was a human being. He was someone&#39;s brother, son, father, uncle. Cops are the most horrible people you could meet. I don&#39;t want to hear anything about this guy doesn&#39;t represent the majority of the police officers. They all stick together to protect one of their own. They all suck!¬†
Cops like these didn&#39;t even give a warning! Just because the suspect was running, you attempt shoot him around 10 times?! Cops like these react so crazily just because of the skin color of suspects like these! Every Time I pass a cop car, I feel paranoid not served and protected! 
Is a lot Certificate Police Officers out there, not a Global Warriors&#39; like Mr. Scott¬†served in the military some of those cops they think they have better training than military soldiers and they above the Law is lot¬†dirty and crooked¬†cops out there the only time Americans need a Police officer is to fill out insurance paper work, if they off duty they like¬†another civilian person is they forgot about that¬†why they have a second job as a security in the civilian side working for some¬†business, they not 24/7 like the military. Crooks!¬†¬†

The young man submitted the video after he read the initial police report which was one big lie...&quot;All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to stand by and do nothing...&quot; and this kid did SOMETHING!
Cops gone wild! 
Kind of hard for the United States to lecture other countries in the world on human rights abuses when this is going on in their own backyard. ¬†Appalling!!
put your hands behind your back dead guy!!!!!
I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it but I feel like their is something really odd about this video. 
If I was there I would have treated that cop like a criminal. I&#39;m CCW I would have protected human life. I would have told the officer to drop the gun if he would have turned towards me I would have shot him.
I shudder to think what will happen if this cop is found innocent...
Isn&#39;t this the EXACT situation that the tazer was made for? ¬†The guy is wearing light clothing and not running very fast
Son of a bitch
Terrible tragedy. But I wonder why the man ran even after being tazed?¬† Makes no sense.
the black cop did it
Me too if you got shot 8 times there would be blood everywhere not a single drop of blood is seen in this vid, and what in the hell was the guy filming in the start of the vid the fence and trees com on man I could stage it better than that...............
Murica! &quot;To Serve And Protect&quot; what a joke. This is just disgusting!!! ¬†I hope that murdering fuck ends up in nasty ass prison as Bubba&#39;s bitch...
fuck the police!
This some bs a white cop shoots unarmed man bitch ass racist cop. He was running what he was mad he couldn&#39;t catch him
I&#39;m not making any kind of excuses for either side. What the cop did was wrong however I stand by what I&#39;ve said who runs from the police over a broken tail light you see how dumb that sounds? That doesn&#39;t even make sense. That&#39;s why I say there has to be something more going on here. I&#39;ve never seen anyone even have to get out of the car over something like that. Either they will give you a warning or a ticket so there has to be a reason for that man begin out of his car in the first place. I&#39;ll say it again I&#39;m not taking up for the police on this but I truly believe there more to this then what the media is reporting. Whoever recorded this don&#39;t quit your day job because you can&#39;t even keep the camera still. With all these video&#39;s they are all the same it always starts in the middle NEVER from beginning to end...
WTF? Why does this Public Servant Handcuff a Dead Civilian he just Executed? I hope everyone in jail got a good look at this guys face. He does not deserve a moments peace, EVER! He will hopefully spend the rest of his life in Solitary Confinement with himself.
what is the object on the ground that was dropped at the officer&#39;s feet that he later picked up and dropped by the man that was shot ? Was that a gun ?
DUMB COPS!!!¬† Apparently, they don&#39;t keep up with the news (Ferguson, etc).¬† Why would you shoot an unarmed man after all that has transpired lately?¬† Without a doubt, all officers should be REQUIRED to wear cameras to combat this.¬† Our local police have started using cameras.<br>BTW: Has this dude ever shot a video before...TERRIBLE!¬† Hold the phone still.
A f....ng coward!!! cold blooded... it seems the way he acts like he&#39;s done it before.<br>good cop, bad cop.... oh well to protect and to serve, Right!!!!
Man I&#39;m glad this camera guy was there and that this fuckin pig got fired.
THIS IS WHY CRIME SCENE PHOTOS OR VIDEO NEED TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC NICOLE HOCKLEY AND BILL SHERLACH! BECAUSE SOMETIMES, AS IN PAT TILLMAN&#39;S STORY OR JESSICA LYNCH&#39;S STORY OR IN SOUTH CAROLINA, HIGH LEVEL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL LIE TO US ! GET IT NOW ?<br><br>¬†<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ</a>
Do I like it for sharing this video, or do I dislike it for hating USA Police?
BLACK COPS ARE ORDERLIES
Can anyone else see the taser cord trailing behind him just as he runs away. Look closely and you can see that 1 end is following him as he runs away and the other end is attached to the officers hand at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=18">0:18</a> . Looks to me like he was already tased before the filming started. Either way, this officer is totally in the wrong. He should have gave chase not shoot him in the back.
Here we go again!!
WOW!
we are living in the 21st ¬†century and look at this man how he has been killed so can you imagine the indians of america how they have been killed this cop should be killed¬†
If the guy actually grabbed the taser I would understand him getting shot but he clearly just slapped it away. .. shame the officer did this but again another stupid move by a criminal. .ur already in trouble so don&#39;t piss off the guy with the gun cause yeah he may have a job where he&#39;s supposed to be a bigger man than that but he&#39;s also human and can make a horrible decision on impulse
Thank god this criminal is off the streets!
Cop one criminal zero!
Arguments that are irrelevant to this case:<br>*The cop firing 8 rounds.<br>*The¬†killer being a cop.<br>*The cop being white.<br>*The victim being black.<br>*Handcuffing the man once shot.<br><br>FACTS that are relevant:<br>*The cop SHOT an unarmed human.<br>*The cop SHOT a¬†human in the BACK.<br>*The cop SHOT a¬†human who was running away.<br><br>Occupation, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, color, creed are all irrelevant when confronted with the FACTS.<br><br>Now, anyone of those FACTS alone...wouldn&#39;t make someone a murderer....as there are circumstances where shooting an UNARMED man wouldn&#39;t be murder, shooting someone in the back isn&#39;t murder, and shooting someone who is running away isn&#39;t murder. Yet, combine those FACTS...together, it is.
That officer is a horrible shot
Unless there is something in the police training manual that says &quot;it&#39;s okay to shoot an unnamed individual who has his back turned to you&quot;.....it&#39;s murder<br>Black, White, Latino, etc...doesn&#39;t matter. He illegally killed someone and got caught, what&#39;s the big debate about? 
VisualiveTV.. ¬†do you have the copy rights to this video?
3¬†Points - 1st - Once sentenced the cop should be mixed in with the general prison population so he can try his Judge Dredd act without a gun.<br>2nd - A federal law requiring cameras on all cops should be passed.¬† It won&#39;t solve the problem entirely but might save some lives and prevent some abuse.<br>3rd - Don&#39;t run from a cop or give him/her any slight reason to act like an animal.¬† You may be innocent and 100 percent in the right but they hold the power of life or death over you.¬† Most won&#39;t act like this coward cop but why chance it.¬†
This clearly could have been a tackle or a TASER. I only stand up for my fellow white cops if they&#39;re right- not trigger-happy killers.
Anyone who thinks this is in ANY WAY &quot;justifiable&quot; or even a even a little bit explainable, I hope one of their close family members get shot in the ass 8 times in their way to fix their broken tailgate by local cop. Then I&#39;ll comment on that video and I&#39;ll explain how justifiable the cop&#39;s action was.
This fckn cop fatally shot him,  than he is like you are now under arrest bitch,  motha fckn cop,  I hope he gets fucked in jail,  when violent inmates find out about this,,  
&quot;Put your hands behind your back now!&quot; He shouts at the lifeless corpse...
So... I know that there are cases where a cop has to shoot someone to protect themself... but in the back? As he&#39;s running away?  Can someone explain why it would even take 8 shots to bring someone down?  Unless you&#39;re TRYING to shoot to kill... and isn&#39;t a cop supposed to try to avoid that of at all possible?  Like... aiming for a leg or shoulder?  I&#39;m not trying to be a smartass... I really want someone to explain this. MY logic isn&#39;t always actually logical. Lmao
Whats odd about this video is that the two police office don&#39;t even acknowledge the guy recording, even though he is standing¬† just about next to them.¬†
Fuck him
I just shot you several times &amp; you&#39;re unresponsive but ima check your pulse... Gtfo
The police in the US are out of control.
How many more black men have died just like this without video Trayvon Martin Michael Brown and many more America we<br> need to wake up that could have been my brother and my sister and my mother on my father I pray to the most High God that he gets just what he is desert plus more bad bad choices they need to go check all his back file how many more people he could have killed
Based on my understanding of the justified use of lethal force for human beings, this was not justified. I understand we are only seeing part of what happened. A taser was deployed prior to the video and we can only speculate as to what happened up to that point. I see the guy jogging, at best, away. The officer appears to pull out his firearm and shoot the individual in the back as he is running away. My understanding is that the only time shooting someone in the back is okay is when you, as a person of reasonable mindset, determine that they are an imminent threat (deadly or of serious bodily harm) to yourself or the general public. My conclusion, based on what I have seen in this video, is that this was an unjustified shooting and a wrongful death. As more evidence is discovered that may change, but I think this video speaks the truth.
The slogan &#39;Black Lives Matter&#39; is only a propaganda to divide the races.  The same Gay vs Nongay and Pro Abortion vs Anti Abortion separates people.  Another popular one is men vs women.  Keeping people busy from the truth.  The owners of this country has a calculated interest in a divided country.  The real owners control our money supply.  I&#39;m talking about the Rockefellers and Rothschilds.  The whole so and so matters is selective.  How about a black man sitting in prison because he shot a gas station attendant?  Even if he turns his life around while in prison, his life will never matter.  It should, but no one thinks like that.  What happens when one a black man gets shot by other black men?  That&#39;s not quite as important in the media.  That&#39;s the way it is.  It is all selective.  
Well, one thing is for sure, he doesn&#39;t have to worry about going to jail because he won&#39;t take care of his children!
The only question that I have is, what is with this kid that he ¬†can&#39;t hold a camera straight and take a good video....gheez
Love how people claim a video of a white cop shooting a black guy is staged....now, what would be the reason for staging a video like this, exactly?
Unintended Consequences occur.....when resisting arrest..<br><br>Pre-traumatic stress syndrome...the left proclaims Global Warming creates..if THAT is &quot;so&quot;...then does it stand to reason that a police officer with Pre-traumatic STRESS a dynamic that ONLY OBEYING the LAW precludes from the unintended consequence of a police office afflicted with such?<br><br>I will be talking about it today....4/9/2015 Thursday...2-4pm est,,,a THINK show...not simply a TALK show.....<br><br><a href="http://presumptivephilospher.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-presumptive-philosopher-show-prep.html">http://presumptivephilospher.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-presumptive-philosopher-show-prep.html</a>
Walter don&#39;t drop that soap BITCH !!!!
WOW...then he don&#39;t even check on him...the other cop does! That is really sad!
I grew in North Charleston. I&#39;ts one of the most dangerous cities in the country. The police are a big reason why. Fuck the police.
Uits sad to seevthe cop shootvthat unarmed man like that, ok he was running away, well the cop could have just chased him on foot and pushed him down, didnt look like the man was running that fast or else the cop could have just fired a warning shot in the air or something and could have just fires at the mans leg instead of shooting him 8 times in the chest and killing him? U cant just shoot a man like that. 
Wouldn&#39;t have happened had Walter not run in the first place. If you choose to struggle/run from cops, you risk the consequences which are often deadly. Cop will get his due in court. Walter would be alive today had he not been a dead-beat dad because then he&#39;d have no reason to fight with the cop and run like a bitch. 
I&#39;ve been saying for years that this country was turning into Nazi Germany, the only difference was that they were not shooting people down in the streets like the Nazis did. ¬†Well guess what? ¬†The USA HAS become Nazi Germany. ¬†I can&#39;t wait to hear this cops reason for shooting this man down in cold blood.
What a shitty world we live in for a pussy as cop to shoot a man 8 times while running away Fucking coward 
That&#39;s y.  We don&#39;t trust u fucking cops!! God said they shall not kill!!! U will pay for ur sin here and with God !!  
Where&#39;s the pawn shop and Advanced Auto they were supposed to be close to?  It looks like a park area.  Definitely looks to be staged.
So when the other cop lifts the shirt how come the white shirt isn&#39;t full of blood I don&#39;t see none if he was hit that many times both shirts should be coverd in blood just sayin 
Disgusting display, animal. Very brave man holding that camera.
Can I get a 2 piece and a small KOOL AId 
This is a shame, this shouldn&#39;t even be an issue. In my opinion its not a black or white, or any other color issue. Cops just use to much force, end of story for me.
This is like GTA logic right now....
This is why all of us cops get a bad name.¬† I hate to see what would have happened if there was no video of the shooting, well thank God there was.¬† This cop needs to spend the rest of his pathetic life in prison.
FAKE!! You seriously telling me that they would have stood there letting the guy record everything? NO!!!
I like to defend cops, but this was wrong. This is the kind of cop that gives everyone else a bad name within the profession.
what the hell is wrong whis us police?shame,sahme
if there was no video they would never believe..<br>because the man was black?<br>Fuck this pig A.C.A.B 1.3.1.2 All cops are bastards!
There was the same vid of Wilson killing brown the vid was removed from Facebook .if Wilson got off so will these guys .the cops partner is an accomplice in the crime .and his partner should have arrested him if he wasn&#39;t but you know how that goes these guys are gangsters not cops .they uphold the rule in acts as law when they swear to defend the constitution and lie !
Fuck you !! ¬†from Morocco¬†to the racist policeman¬†
publicly paid assassins in uniform,,, but seriously thoe can anyone imagine the aint this a bitch factor that came over him once he saw the guy with the camera recording
I wonder if a citizen can use deadly force to defend another citizens life in a case like this....
Okay, I&#39;ll write it once again, Close Down the Police Departments. Citizens only need ELECTED Sheriffs and their sworn deputies, who will respect the rule of law and uphold the citizen&#39;s Constitutional Rights, and who are subject to recall or firing by the voting electorate of citizens.¬† City Police Departments are filled with criminally minded thugs, rapists, thieves, abusers, and killers.
A disgusting abuse of power and then lies, it makes me sick, how many more people are gonna die before this crap ends
if this guys was white and the cop was black no big deal shit happens all the time to white people and nobody cares!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FUCK DA POLICE!!!
COPS ACT LIKE ISIS-----ISIL<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_U1oFcCAZo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_U1oFcCAZo</a>
Eight shots were fired as the guy is running away so clearly the cop&#39;s life was in danger and to add insult to injury let&#39;s cuff him as he lays there lifeless. I&#39;m surprised the person that recorded this is still alive
These things have been happening to black people for the longest time.<br><br>It&#39;s high time this stops now. Racist cops watch out.
Should of paid his child support fucken loser...
Incredible !!! Ist succed in civilized word.
I wouldn&#39;t gave him CPR either...
1. if not under a real threat, how can you kill a human being, when you are supposed to protect civilians?<br>2. After you killed, how on earth you are not capable of treating a dead body, that is dead because of you, with its due dignity. Where is the DIGNITY. there is none. The respect you show for others, it is the same you show to yourself. I hope your heart will come to this understanding. I hope life will give you back what you caused.<br>3. A black president does not evidently stop racism.¬†<br>4. Hatred shouldn&#39;t be payed back with more hatred, but with LOVE.<br>5. America is fighting globally not to fight back existing threats, rather to maintain its hands on material benefits. America you saved our ass on the II WW, but I really would like you to stop going other places and kill innocents. Please stop.<br>6. No one is entitled to take away a life.
Dumdass why run...just listen and do what you told..
IM SO AGAINST THE PEOPLE SAYING COPS ARE UNJUST FOR KILLING ALL THE AFRICAN AMERICANS LIKE ITS A HUGE ISSUE WHEN WHITE PEOPLE ARE GETTING SHOT JUST AS MUCH BY THEM SAYING THAT!¬†¬† THIS IS COLD BLOOD MURDER
&#39;&#39;bravo&#39;&#39; u shot the most wantend criminal and u did it now go to prison for life time and dont forget the wedding dress beacŒ±use there is the true justice SAME OF U 100% CRIME
If found guilty, hope he gets the chair. 
do you know why they cant publicized this hero camera man? because, those Mafia cops will kill him too.<br>Slager should carry a death penalty or the public will go for the worst. 
Can I ask what happen to a non threatening shot like to the leg huh did the guy try not cause any harm to the officer
Wait, he was handcuffed too. ¬†After being fired upon.
Wonder what Charles Barkley think about this video
That cop is a murderer,plain and simple.
He could have tackled him then hancuffed him not shoot him too death for God sakes.üòä
Why in Gods name are we shooting peopleüò¢
He lived through that i assumeüòä
Godbless those peopleüòä
How do you fear for your life when someone is running away from you..  This was hard to watch.  This cop needs some serious prison time.
I hope he gets raped in prison.. It&#39;s what he gets for being a coward, shooting an unarmed man in the back and murdering him. Tired of these cops hiding behind their badge and getting paid vacation and slap on the wrist.<br><br>No one drafted them, they chose this job, if they can&#39;t do their job right, then they need to go get another job and stop abusing their power, and let good cops do their job...
An office of the law, or a normal citizen for that matter, can shoot a fleeing felon (in the front, or back, or side or anywhere) if that felon is deemed to pose a risk to the public. ¬†What did this guy do? ¬†Why was he fighting the cop and fleeing merely for being stopped for a broken tail light. ¬†His car is nowhere in sight, so he obviously ran prior to this video being shot. ¬†<br><br>Although a cop shouldn&#39;t shoot someone in the back who is not a threat to the public, here is some practical advice to keep yourself alive. ¬†Don&#39;t fight the cop.
It seems that he was resiting the tazing after attempting to escape, then the cop became irrationally racist-angry over the tazing fail that desided to finish him on the run.
Tits on youtube? NO!!<br>Black guy getting shot 8 times, yeah ok thats fine<br><br> -youtube logic
First, I want to state that I&#39;m not defending the cop.<br><br>I saw a frame by frame analysis of this video. ¬†In the beginning of the video, both the cop and Mr. Brown (God rest his soul) ¬†are on the ground wrestling, struggling. ¬†This is difficult to see at normal speed and the video is sideways and blurry at that point. ¬†Then Mr. Brown gets up, breaks free and runs. ¬†<br><br>Let me be clear, Mr. Brown should not have been shot....in the back....which is not only legally wrong....it&#39;s an act of cowardice to shoot a man in the back. ¬†However, what I find as a common thread with officers of the law is this. ¬†If you challenge them physically, verbally, or in any way challenge them and their authority, such as by wrestling with them, they become dangerous. ¬†They may shoot you. ¬†<br><br>Why did this guy fight the cop?
You can&#39;t get away with murder nomatter what you kill someone and you demand a death body to put his hands behind murder penalty 
8 rounds to the back...better cuff him too
Bad shoot, and the officer admits it by retrieving the taser and placing it¬†next to the body. He knew he fucked up.
I&#39;m glad that someone had a camera and started recording that shit or other wise that punk ass cop would&#39;ve been making up some bullshit ass excuse like the rest of them other dirty pigs... Shit a cop&#39;s worst fear is a video camera 
Can&#39;t see any legit reason for this shooting. ¬†This cop will be prosecuted. ¬†You will not see us defending his actions. In fact I&#39;m a cop and this makes me sick. ¬†To all the cop haters- take these incidents case by case. ¬†Don&#39;t stereotype us please. Hundreds of thousands of police contacts occurred today. ¬†You wont see those on the news because everything went smooth.
Ok, obviously this officer over reacted and exercised extremely poor judgement. But why are people leaving out the other half of the conversation? The man tried to wrestle away the officer&#39;s taser gun, you can see it fall to the floor as the man turns his back to the cop as the cop reaches for his actual gun. So if the guy tries to wrestle away a weapon from a police officer, what should the cop do? Yes, in an ideal world he should&#39;ve shot him in the leg, or pursued him and wrestled him to the ground, but this wasnt a random act of violence by a police officer towards an innocent civilian. If you dont want to roll the dice and deal with a police officer&#39;s reaction provoked by you wrestling away a weapon or resisting arrest, dont do dumb shit in the first place.
if you cant run after him and need to shoot him, you shouldn&#39;t have a badge. you have to pass PT test to be a cop right? so how about fucking using it you pigs?
Well, in my view it was a self-defense. Who knows if he suddenly turned around and shot the officer with his hidden gun or something? Most of all, don&#39;t break the law and run away from police officers in the first place. No officer would even touch your hair if you didn&#39;t break the law.
These kinda punks give USA a bad name. No wonder why we are hated on by most nations. Vengeance is mine says the LORD!. Consider yourselves lucky, if we decided to unite and fight back. The system would not have a chance. We people out number them big time. We have to suffer just like Jesus, so don&#39;t trip. GOD BLESS AMERICA!..üò§üòØ
Send that fuck to prison put him on the main yard and let him get his
please just suspend all white cops without pay or with pay doesnt matter and we wont have this problem anymore
Hmm the reason he never put his hands behind his back Is because he is dead!!!!! Fucking hate police scum bags and yet there&#39;s people on here who agree with his actions why because his black?? if he was white you would be singing another tune. This cop is now facing 30years to life and rumours of the death sentence for 1st degree murder and this fucking prick below me saying it&#39;s staged open your fucking eyes pal life&#39;s not a movie 
Jesus help them
Suspect shouldn&#39;t have resisted, HOWEVER there is no excuse for the officer shooting him 8 times in the back as he ran from him! The officer has been fired and arrested. He will likely spend the rest of his life in prison. Let&#39;s leave the black / white thing out of this. This is simply a cop executing a man as he flees. The last thing we need is Al and Jesse, riots and looting. Let the system do it&#39;s job and lock this cop up for life. Just a shame that somebody had to die... Just to be clear, I respect the Police but not a bad one like this guy. The tension between regular folks and the police is getting worse and worse.¬†
Were the first rounds blanks? Orrrrr? Were you using those things on top the gun that they refer to as sights? Is the running man God and took 8 rounds before going down? I need filled in on how it takes 8 rounds to take down a target moving .03mph away from you from 10 yards..
White guy tell the truth<br><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=418823201629005&amp;set=vb.100005039869392&amp;type=1">https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=418823201629005&amp;set=vb.100005039869392&amp;type=1</a>
Soo sad, where is this nation heading? God have merci!
White Racist pro police supporters are going to run out of excuses for defending these racist white cops. Before cell phones cops would lie and create some BS story to murder unarmed black men, but now with everybody carrying a cell phone with a camera and video recorder? Forget about it! Their days of immunity from murder are in the past.
It is not getting worse, cops have been killing for years, it is now on video for the entire world to see.
You don&#39;t know what happen preceding this incident, not saying its justify&#39;d, just would need the entire encounter before I nor any1 should make a judgement. So knock off the jumping to conclusion crucifying¬†the¬†&quot;shooter&quot;¬†like everytime this shit happens!!! Each time from Zimmerman-Brown-LaCross boys-to cigerrette man ect.... They all were¬†justify&#39;d when finally all the¬†facts were out!¬†Let all the facts come in you bufoons gee. Don&#39;t get me wrong, if the policeman was or ever is in the wrong, HELL yeah, hangem you ask me, till then hold your horses &amp; let the facts come out, simple as that.
This cop is a bad example of a cop. He deserves to be shot just like he did this unarmed man. He is a poor excuse as a cop &amp; a human being. 
Isn&#39;t it sort of ILLEGAL to run from the police?
Big ups to the camera man!!! You deserve a reward for this!!
I see 2 MEN that¬†BOTH made bad decisions.<br><br>Both Men were wrong for their actions in this video, unfortunately it cost both men there lives in 1 form or another(prison).<br>¬†End of Story<br><br>not racism.
STOP RESISTING!! What a joke, I don&#39;t give a damn what any of you say. This guy was an IDIOT. Don&#39;t resist and Live. So quit showing these videos that miss what really happened and only show the end result of what happens when you fight with an officer of the law. SERIOUSLY,¬† all of you shut the F up until you can show me videos of cops shooting Black men that were not resisting. none of you know what happened b4 this video started. Either way, YOU DO NOT RESIST A COP. DUH. FYI, There will be no peace until you can learn NOT to resist an officer of the law, until then, I Support the men and women that protect everyone regardless of color. Fight with an officer and deal with the consequences or shut the F up!¬† If your done wrong by a cop, you take them to court with your video without resisting. so tired of this race baiting b.s.¬† It&#39;s not a coincidence these videos keep only showing the end of fights. what a joke, not everyone is dumb enough to fall for this garbage
Why do we have to assume it&#39;s because he was black...  Why can&#39;t it be he&#39;s just a horrible cop...  
This is unreal, this cop gives every cop in the land a bad name. Shoots a man fleeing.... what a coward. I hope this cop gets the electric chair.
Never apply such stupidity to the general.<br> Not all cops go for this nonscence
This is a disgrace. I am white, and sometimes I get tired of black people bitching about the cops, etc... but when you see something like this, its extremely disturbing. Wtf...
Here is what bothers me the most: let&#39;s pretend there was no film, OK? ¬†The so called &quot;forensics&quot; could EASILY show the bullets hit him in the BACK, and EASILY show it was NOT point blank, so no way could you say it was in a struggle or some such. ¬†In other words--forget the film, the forensics could prove what happened, but do you think for one damn minute those &quot;forensic results&quot; would have brought about the arrest of this officer? ¬†I truly like to believe it would, and I can&#39;t prove otherwise, but police officers, everywhere, I am sorry to say we the people are starting to have our doubts.
At first I heard the guy grabbed his tazer. That would have been a different story. But looks like he just smacked it away then ran. Looks like you race baiters finally found your dirty cop. Congrats!
Thanks God we have smartphones and ass holes like this shit face will have problems doing their dirty job from now on.
How racist could you possibly be to only show the end of this video. Unedited my A--! I&#39;m not stupid. Stop starting a race war. Get jobs and support your families and quit resisting the law. Stop using drugs, quit making excuses. So tired of this. Yea, your grandparents may have dealt with real racism but 99% of you today(u know who u r) have only dealt with name calling. It&#39;s 2015. Get your stuff together and quit asking for handouts
It is possible that the fugitive pulled a muscle in his lower back and fell and hit his head, and then died from a heart attack from the intensity of running, and that none of the bullet wounds were serious.  And just as likely, the cop is a time-traveller sent back to correct a time anomoly.
I told myself not to scroll down and read the comments. My mistake. The cop shot an innocent person. That cop is now charged with murder....and it seems almost without zero hesitation. Is there anything else to say about this?¬†Or do we need Starbucks to come¬†and chime in on it? There&#39;s nothing left but¬†for the family to mourn. I do feel sorry this man&#39;s family and hope they find some kind of peace in the near future.
He went to high school to become dunb idiot ass. Yes, you on uniform. Your girls hate you. You a dumb ass tunnel that makes real law enforcement look stupid

Man what a stupid cop if I was him i would not have ran after him  just put a warrant out on him and call it a day. He shot at him like he was a terroist
Can&#39;t wait for the war to start. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lockedandloaded">#lockedandloaded</a>
More fuel for the fire just had to be a white cop shooting a black man in the back all this is going to turn into is more politics b*<b>****</b> it&#39;s not going to be about the family it&#39;s not going to be about the cop it&#39;s going to be about people using the situation to get what they want that&#39;s all it boils down to and you can post all your hate replies it won&#39;t matter it&#39;s not going to change anything
Something doesn&#39;t look right with that video the guy isn&#39;t even really running and doesn&#39;t react to any of the shots as if he was actually fatally hit.
Welcome to America, Home of Racism!!!!!
Wow according to the video he had no weapon. He tried to flee but a police officer can only use force if the person reaches for a weapon like a gun or knife and steps toward the officer. The police officer committed murder. According to the police radio he told them he was reaching for his tazer? He was then cought throwing his racer down near the body after the fact. Does sc have the death penalty? If so say goodbye to this officer.
The bullet holes are right next to the purple grapefruit in the easter bunnys ass.¬† This is so fucking sad, and these idiots are to be our future?
You can clearly see him drop the evidence right next to his suspect to close the distance of reasonable doubt of the suspect being a threat to him which weird also was the other officer watch him do it does he not become an accessory I forgot they watch out for each other
<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/walter-scott-shooting/michael-slager-n337691">http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/walter-scott-shooting/michael-slager-n337691</a>¬†More information on cop.
The Black guy ran soo slow.....
Why the fuck would u run from the cops. That kid was hiding something cause an innocent person wouldn&#39;t run from the cops unless they r hiding something. Smh 
God damn bullshit....that&#39;s why I hate fucking cops rite there. That guy was not a threat to him. A life taken for no damn reason.  My heart goes out to his family
yes, government employees should were cameras. Then they should hire people to review the film and mail people speeding tickets in mass. Really all kinds of infractions could be dealt with by simply, REVIEWING the FILM. Good thing us poor black and white folks are PERFECT and NEVER do anything wrong or NEVER pressed for time to SURVIVE. Cameras on Cops should work GREAT!!!!
I wonder why the other cop didn&#39;t question why the cop¬†dropped his taser next to the victim.
Soooo since the officer was too fat to run, he shoots him 8 times?
The sad truth now revealed is that there are thousands of thugs wearing police uniforms in the US. ¬†The uniform might as well be a Halloween costume. ¬†Let&#39;s see:¬†<br><br>Choke-holds and summary executions for guys who are gasping for air and pleading because they can&#39;t breathe (suspected of selling loose cigarettes).<br>Shooting motorist ordered to get their ID because they reach for their ID (suspected of seat-belt violation).<br>Plus this BS (and countless others) of shooting (in the back) dead an unarmed non-threatening fleeing citizen; (stopped for allegedly driving with a broken taillight). This also has the added Fuhrman -like flavor of planting evidence to further this particular officer/deviant&#39;s cause. ¬† (Fuhrman has admitted to doing this and much more - do you think that he is unique?)<br><br>Just think: When NYC cop Justin A. Volpe shoved a plunger up Abner Louima&#39;s rectum damaging his insides and then sticking the plunger in Louima&#39;s mouth - what was the process that got him to feeling confident enough to even think about doing something so deviant. ¬†The inference is that however small his indiscretions (witnessed by his partners) were to begin with: they certainly escalated - because cops generally don&#39;t turn cops in; and the checks and balances are a joke at best - or they don&#39;t even exist.<br><br>Our police are not heroes simply because they get a job in law enforcement. ¬†But some of the new guys probably want to be. ¬†The culture however will break them like rusty nails if they even dare to speak out against what they know is happening. ¬†<br><br>This criminality is based on more than racism and classism - though it is heavily rooted in them. ¬†It is also based on arrogance and gangdom; on the &quot;I feared for my safety‚Äù go-to whitewash which is the song that cops are trained to sing early on - and which civilian juries tend to swallow hook, line and sinker...or they themselves carry racist and &quot;classist&quot; baggage. ¬†<br>The countdown has begun. ¬†Who will the next unarmed civilian killed by cops be? Someone you know?
Not only is he going to shoot him, but handcuff? Wtf?!
Make peace prevailüòä
We are going to have a race war on our hands pretty soon if we don&#39;t get this under control.
I wish people in the media would stop making this a race issue. 9/10 it is not despite opposite races involved. It is about psychotic cops who should have never been cops in the first place being completely irrational or reckless. This cop needs to be tried for murder. End of story. If the cop cannot chase down a person running that slow, they should not be on the street...period.
Fuck the police 
If you pause it you can see the taser trails going from the guy running towards the cops hands. Im pretty sure he had the taser in one hand and the gun in the other. I&#39;m just trying to figure out what flies away from the cop when you first see them.
Wow, i know that if it was&#39;nt for this recording the Facts of this Murder would have been distorted. ¬†This cop needs to Get Life in Prison!
How do you turn a pussy into a dick, you give them a badge. Coward is going to be someone&#39;s bitch in prison. (Hopefully a big black guys) 
I agree this is bad, but does it really matter if he&#39;s black or not?
The guy is dead with 8 bullets in his back, face down, the cop takes 10 seconds to walk to him and  screams put your hands behind your back like he&#39;s resisting. Lol. 
If it wasn&#39;t for the video... that&#39;s what was said for Eric garner... look what happened. But one things for sure. If for some unknown reason the verdict is innocent, than America will go down in flames that night. 
At exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=91">1:31</a> he throws the taser on the ground. This cop was obviously trying to cover up his shooting!
Not only was this cop a murderer, the other cop was an accomplice and a coward as well. The accomplice must also be charged for murder.
to all of you commenters who say you are cops and say this cop gives good cops a bad name. FUCK YOU there are absolutely NO good cops. heres why, if you see one of your own do something illegal or against department policies do you ever call out and report your own? but you want me to snitch on my buddies for whatever reason and if i dont snitch then we all go to jail. but you let your own get away with this and help them cover it up, or remain silent. one cop here in baltimore exposed his own colleagues and they would leave dead rats on his car and porch. and he has been blackballed by all of his comrades. you cops are sick and are the most violent gang in america. and the judges, prosecutors, and politicians are the gang leaders, you cops are the gang foot soldiers. 28 years on this earth and the only time i called 911 was for fires and medical emergency. fuck cops
That fu**ing lazy cop couldn&#39;t chase that guy down.... instead he had to shoot his slow ass 8 times.... your life is over cop!¬†
Who is policing the po-lice man come on murder with a license. Don&#39;t worry pig they can get to you in lock down. 
This looks staged everyone is way too calm. the reactions after and before the shots of the people are very suspicious. If this did happen its terrible. BUT PEOPLE DONT BELIEVe EVERYTHING YOU SEE OR HEAR IN THE NEWS PLEASE!! Understand that everytime something happens that their is always some agenda they want pushed through is that not enough to understand that a government would stage a scene like this to create &quot;CIVIAL UNREST&quot;. Is this hard to believe that our own government would stage this. All i&#39;m saying please think things through before you react and let people like Al Sharpton stir things up again.
it is very important to film the police!
In the Durty South they (WASPS Germanics) been shooting minorities, Catholics and the poor since the beginning of the union, and covering it all up

God bless this mans soul on his way to heaven. Good watch this man on his trip and keep him save.<br>Now let&#39;s get one thing straight the man who stood here and video taped this THE FUCKIN REAL NIGGA OG. I MEAN LIKE HE HAD THE GUTS TO KEEP ON GOING AND POST IT AND HE CAUGHT HOW THE POLICE ARE ON VIDEO ITS OVER. NOW IM SORRY THAT THIS POOR BLACK MALE HAD TO BE USED AS A EXAMPLE TO SHOW HOW MUCH A HUMAN CAN BE SO EVIL BUT I THE ONLY BRIGHT THING TO THIS STORY IS FUCKIN JUSTICE IS GONNA BE announced.üíØüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
Whats the point of being a cop if u love black people? Honestly
screw the pigs in blue they think they can kill any body because the have a badge. there are so many cases were cops kill innocent people I say fuck them assholes in blue.
How is he going to put his hands behind his back if you just cowardly shot the guy in the back running away all honors to the person who filmed this thanks for exposing another dirty cop
And cops wonder why their hated.....fuck that pig.....hope he gets what&#39;s coming to him.....
i hope that pig squeals every single day in prison while he is getting ass fuck in the shower . fuck that pig glad hes going to jail hope he pays for what he did .
So what fell out of the suspects hand or the cops hand right at the start of the video? Was it the cops taser? Was it the suspects gun? I need more details to form an opinion, because if they were fighting with a gun that got dropped and then the guy ran away that changes everything, if it was the cops taser then thats murder. 
There you go.  something you can call police brutality now. This is murder
Why do you put cuffs on a dead guy unless all 8 shots missed? Really?
Stupid cop. You deserve to go to prison.
Whoever recorded this probably saw what happened from the very beginning, should get a reward for recording it. Very brave as the cop could have turned the gun on him also.
I have been a cop for 23 years and I have never seen anything like this! This type of cop makes it hard for the good ones. This  discrace of a cop needs to spend the rest of his life in jail. This is not the job, and citizens  I apologize for this idiot!!!! 
Without this video tape ,they would have taken this cop&#39;s word as law ! They wouldn&#39;t have even admitted that what really happened was even possible ! His boss would have defended him until the end !!!!!Grand jury would have cleared this murderer of any and all charges and they would have called the protester out ,as players of the race card !There is no defense against the video but the real proof is in the puttin ! Even fox news couldn&#39;t twist this into their usual types of lies ! There is a 100% chance that the jury ,in this case, will be all white! This cop go&#39;s free or gets meaningless ;punishment !!!!!!!! Time served ????????
I&#39;m very sad for all parties involved here...I hope they will be ok. I looked at this video and I saw a struggle with the officer and the assailant take place. I saw a taser wire that was probably visible to the officer making him think this man grabbed his weapon and took off. To me, a taser might as well be a deadly weapon because it can incapacitate you and the assailant can commandeer another more lethal weapon while you are in a state of vulnerability from the taser. So when this guy runs away, I think the cop is justified in shooting him. If the officer changed his story, that&#39;s not very surprising. He probably doesn&#39;t want to go to jail the for rest of his life for doing his job. I am shocked from what I&#39;ve seen in this video that this officer is in jail, let alone facing murder charges.
I live in charleston a few miles from where this happened, its disgusting what our police are doing and if this video was not made public the man would of probably got away with murder.

Deuteronomy,66:You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life. 67In the morning you will say, ‚ÄúIf only it were evening!‚Äù and in the evening, ‚ÄúIf only it were morning!‚Äù‚Äîbecause of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see
There has been a pattern of white cop/black guy shootings since Ferguson. This seems intentional to drum up the coming race war that they are trying to create. Therefore, I think some of these shootings are fake. I am starting to suspect foul play on this one. First, the guy was supposedly pulled over for a traffic violation. I see no cars around whatsoever. Second, the camera guy is completely ignored by the cops. Cops always try to get you to go away and/or confiscate your camera. They never ignore people video taping them. Lastly, and most importantly, when the two cops are inspecting him, there is absolutely no blood on him at all. The white undershirt would easily show it, but not a drop. There appears to be a hole in the right shoulder, supposedly from a bullet (could have been put there ahead of time). At that spot, surely there would be a lot of blood, yet none at all. Since when do people get shot and don&#39;t bleed? The media is also playing up the race card big time, which is another tip off of a possible hoax. There&#39;s many other tell-tale signs, but if you don&#39;t know the games that the elite play, then you wouldn&#39;t understand.
Yep. You killed him. No need to check for a pulse buddy! If you were really concerned perhaps you would&#39;ve checked for that pulse prior to handcuffing a guy you just pumped 8 rounds into! Just saying&#39;. Have fun in prison with the brothers! 
They need to hire cops in north Charleston according to IQ instead of background
I don&#39;t even know what to say to this bullshit
Dudes already dead and they still put hand cuffs for him... So what did the guy even do??
Let&#39;s see how tough that pig is when he arrives in prison, I am sure he will be put in protective custody. 
I hope this &quot;COLD HEART&quot; gets it nice and slooooow if he even makes it to prison! Even with this video, it&#39;s very likely that he walks. Sad state of humanity that we are living in.
this is not human kind but pure evil
So he runs back to get the tazer and drops it near the Mr. Scott&#39;s body. Messing up the evidence to say that the poor guy had the tazer with him. What a low life trash.¬†
If these cops continue their &#39;rampage,&#39; I&#39;m willing to bet that we&#39;re going to end up having a dictator in power.
I still don&#39;t understand the mentality of blacks who think it&#39;s a good idea to tussle with a white police officer. That&#39;s like going to a wildlife reserve and feeding the bears. I mean, is one of your brethren showing up dead on the news at least once a week not enough to dissuade you? What exactly is the desired outcome? Even if your eventual death by bullets is a result of unnecessary police brutality, the best you can hope for is that somebody like this captures the murder on video. In other words, it&#39;s a lose/lose situation. Better to sit there, shut the hell up, and only speak when spoken to.<br><br>Of course, I&#39;m sure somebody will chime in here and accuse me of siding with the police, in the same way that someone suggesting that a woman not go home with a man she barely knows and drink copious amounts of alcohol is accused of promoting rape culture.
Don&#39;t run
This is sickening to watch. Whats more disgusting is reading all the comments actually trying to justify this killing. This is why i hate everyone. 
as a white man but more so as a human being, i am utterly sickened and shocked by this video. This cop is clearly a sociopath and it terrifies me that this type of cop exists in our world...somehow they need to be weeded out before anymore senseless murder happens. cops who are angry by how they are treated in society take a looks at this video.
Scary to think that there is cops out there that do crazy things like this. That could be you, me or our kids
i&#39;m ex-military and a very &quot;rule of law&quot; type of guy, that right there was murder, plain and simple.
7 shots!? Wtf if the cop wasn&#39;t such a lazy pig Inge could have chased him 
So between 20-21 seconds what is the black guy throwing on the ground, because that&#39;s what the cop picked up and dropped by him use you damn eyes people, the guy throws something from his right hand, you can see it laying in the grass
At the 17 second mark it looked like the man took off the taser and dropped it.
Babylon ya muda skunt 
His cell mate will think hes pretty
Murder
I&#39;m pretty sure this happens a lot, cop kills then tells a his version. The only reason other fellow cops are turning their back on him is because of this video. Its not what you know its what you can prove, which is why riding with a friend or someone can be your witness. With the body cameras I bet they&#39;ll be less killings like these by pigs who don&#39;t want to run after and take down a slow old subject.
THUMBS UP for the brave man that video taped this RACIST PIG WHO SHOT AN INNOCENT MAN IN THE BACK! <br>üëçüëçüëèüëèüòä
Officers, I feel are just getting bolder and bolder by the day. They saw Zimmerman get off, along with the Ferguson deal, and they feel they can abuse, slaughter, and intimidate young African American men without any form of consequences.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=63">1:03</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=69">1:09</a>, the officer runs back to pick up something black from where they were standing. Between <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=90">1:30</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=92">1:32</a> the officer throws the black object down next to the dead man.
Why not give police machine guns. What if a group of kids are trying to run away? They need enough bullets to hose em all down.
Ok ladies and gentleman, yes this is murder, and yes, he had no right to shoot the man 8 times, but, did you see the wires? Did you see the tazer wires stuck in the cops arms? That means his tazer was not able to be used, but it does not justify shooting a man down like that, if i were him, one foot shot or leg shot should have been enough, not 8 shots in the back, its pointless killing.<br><br>This is a neutral statement, so don&#39;t give me crap, I am trying to see what you guys think about this.
–¥–∞... –µ–±–∞–Ω—É—Ç—ã–µ —É –≤–∞—Å –º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã....
This is absolutely horrible. My prayers go out to this poor mans family. This cop will fry for what he has done. There is no way in hell this cop feared for his life. The poor man was running away from him. This is truly disgusting. This is america for you. Cops can pretty much do whatever they want. I hope this officer gets what he deserves. And I want to thank the man who recorded this video because without you, this would just be another cover up shooting.
Black or white that is irrelevant, the fact is that he resisted arrest and tried to escape. People seem drunk as understanding the reality, is a rational dementia epidemic.
This is simple. ¬†If Mr. Scott had not fled and obeyed simple orders from an officer (regardless of race) he was being questioned by, Mr. Scott would be alive right now. ¬†But i do not feel Mr. Slager was fighting for his life either, i mean heck pursue and catch him a block away. ¬† I agree with Mr. Notz Jr. i am not agreeing this was staged, but i have never seen a man being shot at fleeing the cops move so slow, nor a trained officer miss a target 7 time from less than 35 feet.
he should get the death penalty,,but first put him in general population,,in prison
It is a wonder he didn&#39;t shoot the person with the camera.
¬†People should crowd fund the man who filmed this. He should get a substantial reward for standing his ground.
That killing is Shameful and DISGUSTING!!!! ¬†I&#39;m just sick about this. ¬†The man who did the recording... ¬†Thank you for being there at the right time, and having the COURAGE to keep recording!! ¬†I was so scared for you and my Heart goes out to the Scott Family!!
Typical liar cop saying this poor guy tried to grab his weapon or some other piece of police murder gear thus giving him justification to kill another human being by cowardly shooting him in the back. ¬†THANK GOD someone had the guts to video this disgusting act of cowardice so that the world can see what happens when the police believe they can operate with complete impunity. ¬†Just imagine if we had a video of absolutely every police shooting and then compared the video evidence against the officers account of the facts. ¬†I guarantee that there would be many more cops on trial for murder. ¬†Also, please don&#39;t believe the bullshit statements by the police departments that this guy is just one bad apple in the bunch, most if not all of of these scumbag cops would have acted in the same way. Because, when no one is watching they get away with it by sticking together and lying about the facts in their report of what actually happened.
One way to stay alive is to avoid cops in the first place. You know the risk, it&#39;s no secret, so don&#39;t give them a reason, don&#39;t do anything stupid that will eventually lead to an encounter with police. We see these stories more, and more, and they usually involve some kind of criminal activity. It&#39;s almost like the black man has white cops paranoid, and scared for their lives. I don&#39;t believe they&#39;re all racists, although some would. This one just doesn&#39;t make much sense.
Fat f***ing peace of s**t to lazy to chase the guy down? I keep putting myself into his shoes trying to run for my life as a trusted authority pulls a gun and aims for¬†the back of my head.¬†he had¬†no right to shoot him. this video makes me wonder about all the pervious shootings of black men that I pushed off as &quot;police doing there job&quot;.<br><br><br>This video makes me sick and pissed off. I was in the MILITARY¬†and I have¬†harsher rules¬†on when I can use &quot;deadly force&quot;. what if the guy defended himself and killed the police officer? would he be prosecuted as a cop killer for defending himself for his right to live? what can you do when a cop pull&#39;s a gun without provocation? trust him?<br><br><br>they say they the cops tried to resuscitate him. when was that? after he cuffed a dyeing man, then took a stroll¬†to find his soon to be planted evidence?¬†this s**t should piss you off whether you&#39;re white or black.
Come to Scotland,if you run from the Police they are actually fit enough and manly enough to chase you and wrestle you to the ground.Not shoot you in the back.
There is absolutely no reason why this young/unarmed man should have been shot five times in the back. It makes me sick. ¬†Get over it, people - ¬†there is one race and that is the human race and we are all children of the same God. If there is one good reason for execution of a bastard to teach others a lesson is summary execution of this corrupt policeman in public without spending millions of dollars in fabricating phony defense for him in months to come. When shall we, humans, become human-beings worthy of appellation, &quot;made in the image of God&quot;?
:50 Did he say put your hands behind your back? Are you fuckin kidding me? The true &quot;hero&quot; (should be the cop) who is doing the job is the man recording, you done your duty as a citizen, 100x better than the cop. Your name may slowly fade away, but your action will live on.
Let&#39;s be honest. I am white and I know that he was shot because he was black. Salty white people be like &quot;it&#39;s not because he&#39;s black&quot; but this is because he&#39;s black. Fucking Feds 
To all the people saying all cops are terrible, horrible pigs: this is just one incident and you can&#39;t blame a group for something that an individual did. The guy is disobeying the law and trying to steal the cops tazer, so I don&#39;t sympathize with his stupidity for getting shot. There&#39;s no need for lashing out at the people who keep these types of people from ruining our society; would you rather there be no cops putting their life on the line everyday so that criminals can do more than they already do? <br>
maybe the cop thought the bullets were bouncing off the guy? i mean he kept running until finally stopping like nothing was hurting him..either that or the cop watched Judge Dredd one too many times.. boy am i glad i bleached my skin white and was rich.. any responses?
Black community stereotyping all white cops. Black community saying white cops stereotyping them. Stop a cop from being a cop and he could not be successful at anything. They have no skills, only arrogance. Regardless of colors, all cops need more training and monitoring, instead of turning losers loose with a shield and loaded gun. Lack of training, poor character and probably going to have mental problems. Good job telling this guy he was hired.
videoing a murder is very dangerous because the perpetrator could have murdered any witness at the scene as well.
the clan has taken their white sheets off and put on police uniforms and business suits,
how many blacks are going to keep shopping at the stores of non blacks? ,,you want to shut them down with no violence STOP BUYING FROM THEIR SHOPS ¬†BLACK PEOPLE,,AND SUPPORT AND BUILD YOUR OWN.how many times have you all heard this ???
Thats fuck up thats y they have teaser whats the meaning to have taser and go to school to be a cop and they cant do their job right
This nigga has got to work on his recording skills.¬†<br><br>Also it didn&#39;t even show what the guy was doing to the cop before he got shot. Was he on drugs? PCP? Was he acting violent? He could have gone off and hurt/killed some innocent person.
The whole incident before the shooting should be investigated before judging the cop
What a horrible way to die. He died face down with handcuffs on. No cpr no ambulance called. Nothing. That fucker needs to be in prison for this.
Both cops should be in jail the other one lied to cover up the murder. They are obligated to render CPR as cops in which they both lied in their reports and said they did. So anything the shooter says happened before the footage is not reliable testimony because he&#39;s already been caught lying and bringing the taser over to where the body fell.
Shot in the back 5 times?<br>No bullet impacts?<br>No blood?<br>Clear view @ mark <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=160">2:40</a>
It&#39;s probably silly to ask, but:<br><br>How did the bystander take such an up close video of the scene and the police officer not once doing anything about it? What was he concealed in?
There was no blood. If you get shot that many times you bleed a lot. I&#39;m calling bullshit.
He should have stopped when he was told to.¬† He&#39;d be alive if he did.¬† Bad decision!
self defence obviously
are they trying to start a race war to justify killing blacks on a mass scale?<br>think seriously about these things black people
There&#39;s a nice corner of hell waiting on this cop. ¬†Wow. ¬†8 shots? ¬†What a vagina this cop is. ¬†Not like the dude running had Usain Bolt speed. ¬†Just another cop playing Judge, Jury and EXECUTIONER. ¬†The best way to get off is to have only one half of a story. ¬†Good job filming.¬†
Props to the guy recording this video. And I say this because Im reading stuff on the internet and its saying that the cop feared for his life and you mean to tell me him pulling out his gun was the best option bull fuckin shit. Doesn&#39;t make sense and another thing why did he have to shoot him so many times he even shot this poor unarmed man as he went down. I can&#39;t believe this this wasn&#39;t no pursuit. I hope he serves time because if not this is gonna be insane we just dealt with a Riot last year don&#39;t need to deal with another one this year put his ass behind bars.
As a British viewer and UK resident, I don&#39;t feel I can comment on how¬†fair (or otherwise) the American justice system is... or of course on what went on immediately prior to this footage. All I DO know is that I appear to have just witnessed a cold-blooded execution of one human being by another. Regardless of what any defence lawyer(s) may imaginatively come up with, the facts are¬†that the man in green was running away from the officer, and that EIGHT shots were fired, all seemingly aimed at the man&#39;s back. The world is watching America, and it can only¬†wait to see if¬†justice will be served. I just hope the local community does NOT do anything newsworthy in retaliation, as¬†this would only serve as a dilution of¬†this seemingly horrendous crime, and ultimately dilute any justice which Mr Scott&#39;s family and loved ones may be entitled to. Rioters are ALWAYS their own worst enemies!
Tennessee v. Garner (1985), the Supreme Court of the United States held that under the Fourth Amendment, when a law enforcement officer is pursuing a fleeing suspect, he or she may not use deadly force to prevent escape unless the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.
I&#39;m a white male, this guy should not have ran, but he was murdered by that cop. No excuse for this killing. 
I want to know if the black guy had a criminal record prior to this event. IF SO, the cop did society a favor. IF NOT, the cop deserves life.
A cowardly cop. He should fry for this, nothing but execution for this murderous twat!<br>
I serve each day with the knowledge that my conduct is being recorded. Because God is always watching me.
Wow. Suspect wasn&#39;t even running fast. And he cuffed him and didn&#39;t even try to help after he gunned him down. This guy is done for.
to the dumbasses who think this is fake I will explain. cops use hallow points for ammo. when the bullet enters the body it bounces all around inside. there is not a exit point from the bullet¬† there is blood you just cant see it in the video. the guy was dead before he hit the ground. very sad cop was in the wrong. in the heat of the moment you do stupid shit. its obvious this cop needed more training. the guy was¬†very slow run after him tackle him. back up was right around the corner.
that video is not even full so you cant really tell but when it started you can see that something hit the ground probably electric gun or what ever maybe he really tryed to took that from him but still he didnt had to kill the guy maybe just shoot in the air so he can stop or something
Looks like the black cop is guilty too
RIP WALTER SCOTT.
That cop is sooo going to be a salad tossing expert in the future...
COP DECIDED TO BE JUDGE AND JURY.<br>DIDN&#39;T SEEM TOO UPSET TAKING A &quot;DEAD MAN&#39;S&quot; PULSE.<br>I SAW THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR TOO MANY TIMES AGAINST<br>AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC MEN.<br>&quot;ASHAMED TO BE WHITE&quot;¬† EX-POLICE OFFICER.
POLICE SATATE OF AMERICA :-( TYRANT STATES OF AMERICA<br> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23barackobama">#BarackObama</a>  SUCK¬¥SSSS  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23newworldorder">#NewWorldOrder</a>  IS HERE :-(
If you look closely you can see the taser string and the taser thrown down....still should not have shot him but you don&#39;t know exactly what happened before he started running because a taser was definitely thrown and shot before the shooting....watch at 18 seconds
THIS WAS ORCHISTRATED... <br>SORRY BUT THE PLAN IS TO LET HIM GO NON GUILTY... Im telling u.. They have a bigger plan afoot  
Surprised the pigs didn&#39;t shoot the camera guy as a cover up
The cop should be jailed, but what has color got to do with it, if it was a black cop killing a white man would it be the same. Must everything be a black issue.
We have to protect us from those who sworn to protect us.....
I&#39;m really curious how they ended up there since it was a &quot;traffic stop&quot; ......and what the conversation was like to get Scott to run away from the officer like that..
this guy is gonna get his ass OPENED in prison
the man did not stop to the order of the police preferred to die¬†
WTF THIS POLICEMAN ?
Wtf? Why no shoot only in the leg? FUK USA 
for you cop lovers and black haters. the guy has served in the military. he went and served his country only to be gunned down over a broke tail light.
you watch the cops will trump up charges on the guy that filmed this murder.
Actually he runs back and picks up the tazer and takes it to the mans body 
On behalf of the white community I would like to say sorry.
Murder , notice as the cop walks behind the tree he picks up the tazer and drops it beside the man . look close you will see it . shame is they will protect the cop in prison for the rest of his life . he deserves general population or death 
Looks like to me guy was reaching into his waistband so the cop had to make a life or death decision. Looks like a good shoot to me
This is not a white or black thing this just a¬†psychopath thing. Jail is all he will have.¬†
So he can turn and run for his taser after he shot him, but he couldn&#39;t chase after him even after he had reportedly chased him to that point? WOW!! Looked like they were standing there having a conversation, where&#39;s the scuffle?
 This is why i hate the fucking police
It&#39;s crazy that everyone has a camera these days. ¬†It makes you wonder just how many cops got away with murder.
the lesson learned ,Follow the rules. ¬†don&#39;t give Police officers the slightest chance of contacting you.
I don&#39;t know wtf is happening to this world man.
I don&#39;t give ah @#$@ what it looks like Ricky Notz Jr, this bitch azz cop is now charged with murder! How ya like dem apples cop lover!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23smdh">#SMDH</a>
J&#39;esp√®re que ce sale porc se fera violer par tous d√©tenus en prison!<br>Mais bon de toute fa√ßon il n&#39;ira jamais en prison car il sera acquitt√© par un jury √† majorit√© blanche!<br>√âtat fasciste.
This is not staged. I live with my parents sister and grandparents in South Carolina and experienced it but from a far distance. What really happened was that man was trying to take the cops tazer to taze the cop but didn&#39;t know how to use it so dropped it and ran away. Then the cop started to shoot him with 8 bullets and hand cuffed him then put the tazer he dropped at his feet. Therefor it is not fake. 
Why he run?
the guy had backup coming from where the man was going...why shoot? You don&#39;t shoot a man in the back.. that is cowardly cop. The Brown shooting was easier to understand as he doubled back like he did at the gas station.. this guy was clearly running.. convict murder 1.
He is going to be buggered so much in those showers.
Cops murder people in the states for a broken tail light??? Im staying up here in the great white north!
I know good cops exist and its a stressful job.but in the world we are living in today with terrible  news after terrible news of all aspects of life this just makes this worst then it already is with this cop.you can spin it anyway you want even if the guy was a criminal ,but this was just straight execution  style.and he even had the nerves to arrest the guy after all those shots at the upper torso towards the heart and lungs.
I dont believe the man was trying to &quot;reach for the tazer.&quot;  If you play it and replay it, the tazer hits the ground with a force of having been slapped down, and the man&#39;s arm is in a downward motion.  
This dude was running in slow motion he was better off walking away
The tazzer was being either deployed or in dry stun mode  because you can hear it. I don&#39;t know if that means anything but listen real good at the beginning you can hear it.
I mean dont blame the cop he was probably too lazy to chase the guy so he unloaded a full clip into the guy just like treyvon no big deal
all cops should be videotaped at all times, the eighth shot was just for good measure i guess
If you&#39;re too lazy to chase a 50 year old fat man at least shoot him in his legs. Geez. Thank heavens for video. Whoever recorded needs to watch his back though.
this has to STOP!!!
Black people don&#39;t belong in America it&#39;s time for us all to return home to the richest continent on the planet. Mother Africa has enough resources for all of us to become richer than ever. Just gotta find away to kick the Europeans out.
Would like to have seen what happened before the video started. 
The video should be renamed to &quot;How to get gang raped in prison&quot;.
This cop just shot this guy who was running away in the back 8 times. The guy didn&#39;t seem to have a weapon, and he took of AWAY from the police officer. What the cop did made no sense. He needs to lose his badge.
Fact !....without this video, the cop would have walked free.<br>Because the footage came to light the authorities had no choice than to arrest the cop. No video ...No arrest !!
Darwin in action... that brother was much too slow to survive in the wild!
<br>That cop is so toast it&#39;s not even funny they should all just taser him at once on max power this is why nobody trusts the police didn&#39;t even try to control the subject and tackle him or anything. If I was the family&#39;s attorney if push for the death penalty if possible and sue that department into destitution. Pre med murder with extreme prejudice. Shoot off 8 rounds hit him with 5 in the back waltz up to him plants his gun/taser beside the suspect and hand cuffs him. Ur dog meat pal can&#39;t wait til u meet the winners u put inside the jungle.  Ex-cop in on Monday, Omar&#39;s bitch on tuesday
Police are no longer concern about being filmed they know the worst thing that can happen to them is being laid off on a paid vacation by our city taxes, and again impunity will be served.
That&#39;s 100% murder! I hope they fry that cop toasty black.  Whoever videotaped that I am so glad they did. Cops have got to start being accountable for their actions and they&#39;re not. I&#39;m white and I can see that. Cops treat my minority&#39;s  like shit!
People are wondering why he was running so slow? He was a 50 year old man not a sprinter.
That is cold blooded murder. Case closed.
He tryd to take the taser in the first seconds if hhe could he would have taken the gun to shoot the cop. Another criminal dead.
All I can say is this is getting way outa hand real quick. fucking crazy shit getting ready to happen.............be ready. Men have their limits......BTW, I&#39;m a¬†white man that would stand by the black mans side to end this BS!.
yes the shooting was bad i agree n yes it does look very set up , but a couple key things to ponder...whats on the ground by the cops feet? .. why do ppl run away from cops when they have a gun drawn? . common sense would tell the guy not to run but yea,some do not have it i guess idk
Did not yell to stop, did not say he was going to shoot. Did not tempt to give chase. Deadly force is authorized if the officer feels their life or someone else&#39;s is in danger. The situation was deescalating very fast. There was no danger to the officer when he shot. <br>How far is a known 50 year old man going to run in a park when you can hear back up coming before the shots were fired.<br>Murder charge for this cop for sure.  
this is real terrorism
What makes me really mad about this is that immediately after the shooting the cop hurries back to retrieve the taser so he can dumb it next to the body. ¬† He then lies about it.
Don&#39;t think u need handcuffs if he&#39;s dead!<br><br>Jman
Forget race - the cops a dick and committed murder. Not that in anyway it was deserved, but the guy shouldnt be grabbing the cops taser and running away......only bad things can happen. All round sad story and terirble waste of two lives.
Sooner or later everyone gonna start killing cops and its gonna be fine with us its fine with me
He&#39;s dead Jim......now¬†Walter is¬†going that that¬†special place in the movie Pulp Fiction.....
That cop just been waiting all day to fire his weapon every cop knows they have tasers this is so fucked up in so many ways.
I see a man shooting another man, who introduced race into it? Doesn&#39;t matter the color, it was wrong period. I guess we have to make it a bigger deal BECAUSE it was a black man and a white officer, not because it was just a man period? Is that what we are supposed to do these days?
Asshole racist cop after 8times shooting still trying  to handcups.poor black man 
Horrible that this guy got killed but seriously........DID HE REALLY THINK HE WAS GONNA GET AWAY!!!??? LMAO
Looks staged to me too. 
Dumbshit cop deserves to rot for life. But still begs the question...<br><br>Why. Would. You. Run??
I just watched the video last night. The cop shot the man, looked over at the guy who was videotaping the incident. Then told the man that he just shot. &quot;Put your hands behind your back!&quot;.  They don&#39;t want the nation in a uproar. 
This cop was actually charged for murder
Oh shit.............oh shit...............................oh shit 
Oh shit.............oh shit...............................oh shit 
my prayers and thoughts to his family,that was an execution and i really think he would have shot no matter the color of the victim, we need to rid ourselves of this type of officer. i think the majority of officers are decent, but these are the ones that make it hard on the good ones . no tolerance for this-none! ¬†again ¬† to his family ¬†god bless you,be strong and you are in our prayers
trigger happy. Damn murican cops are stupid as fuck. the only solution they have is to shoot people. that dude ran so slow, even my 6-years old kid can catch up with him. in Europe, cops only use firearms where there&#39;s no choice, but this that cop seem like he had a choice but use to shoot him instead.
It looks like the guy took his taser in the beginning of the video. Still doesn&#39;t justify the cop shooting him in the back though.
This is so upsetting!!!!!!
He went and picked up the taser and put it down to the side of¬†the victim¬†kind of behind the other cop that showed up and then picked it up again at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=120">2:00</a> min mark. I feel for the poor guy that got shot. This is straight up murder.
Unedited?¬† Really?¬† The vid starts with the guy running away ... what a coincidence that during the alleged struggle the video showed the ground.¬†<br>¬† But in the end, it still looks like an unjustified use of deadly force.¬† The guy wasn&#39;t running so much as a slow jog.¬† Not much of a threat at that point.
weird that he didn&#39;t verbally react to the shooting while it happened. And he held the camera very straight and didn&#39;t flinch or even slightly withdraw from the gunfire. Might not mean anything but it is interesting.
If you&#39;re wondering why the camera man felt safe enough to approach the officer it&#39;s because... the officer was out of ammo.
THIS IS SICK. Not only did that police officer shoot down an unarmed man but then neither of the officers at the scene made ANY effort to save that man&#39;s life. <br>What did they do?<br>Handcuffed &amp; searched him. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. It is part of police training to know first aid &amp; neither of those &quot;officers of the law&quot; made any effort to put their training into practice or indeed do what is humane, what is right. Shame on both of them. I hope the officer who indiscriminately shot him is found guilty &amp; my condolences go out to Mr Scott&#39;s family. 
Here&#39;s solid evidence of a near future death penalty case captured on film.<br><br>¬† ¬† A young fit cop decided to shoot some 9 TIMES an older slow jogging man in the back ?? ¬† ¬† This is very much like pre meditated brutal murder = death penalty case.¬†<br><br>¬† ¬† Filming ¬†Police ¬†Is ¬†Essential¬†<br><br>1 question: ¬† Was the guy who got murdered here the scum of the earth lowlife repeated criminal ? ¬† ¬†Or was he just a human being who ran ?
there is absolutely nothing this cop can say to get himself out of this shit, that is cold blooded murder, plain and simple.¬†
Hand this coward over to the ISIS
For once a video that really leaves no doubt at all - like the Rodney King video. That man is a disgrace to his badge and the entire force! Murder - plain and simple.
If you watch closely in the beginning when the guy begins to run away from the cop, slow down the speed to .25 and you&#39;ll see what looks like a small struggle then what looks like the shape of a gun being tossed from the guy who was shot. ¬†To me it looked like a gun, and since we never get to see what happens from start to finish and it&#39;s always shaky footage, I can only speculate, but I think that while the cop was inspecting him, he found a gun, or the suspect tried to pull it, dropped it and tried running.
Isn&#39;t this a common occurrence in America? Supposedly a first world &quot;super power&quot; country. Call me ignorant but I hate America due to the love for their constitution and the complacency towards firearms.

Nothing in life is all black or all white (no pun intended) you have your bad cops,but not all are bad. You have your bad whites-not all are bad, bad blacks-not all are etc.....this here is a bad¬†or seriously deranged cop. The legal system will handle him. But, if black community (being right on this) loses it and starts up with the burning and disruption and bringing hell on everyone then THEY LOSE WHATEVER POINT THEY RIGHTFULLY HAVE IN THIS.¬†Grieve, peacefully protest in all solemnness and we will stand with you to make changes AND THUGS NEED TO STOP BEING THUGS TOO BTW.
Its too obvious that the officer wanted to kill him. The man is running slower than a turtle and then the officer takes like 10 minutes to aim down his sight to finally shoot at him until the man goes down, while keep in mind, the man only ran about 10 feet. I&#39;ve seen the show Cops, they chase after them. Are Cops really this lazy and trigger happy that a gun is their first option? It would&#39;ve been interesting to see how this story would have twisted if nobody filmed it. 
To: DogwithoutBone ¬†So standard procedure equals yellow-bellied coward robots.
Im a supporter of the police that &quot;Protect &amp; Serve&quot; the community. It&#39;s an admirable job and I know I wouldn&#39;t want to do it. However, this was a murder ! Had this incident not been recorded you can bet that the cop who killed this guy would have claimed self defense and the other cop would have backed his story up. This is why the public does not trust law enforcement .
wow! pretty obvious the cop wasn`t just trying to stop the guy. what`s up with shooting an unarmed fleeing guy anyway!? and what the fuck is the deal with cops handcuffing someone after they`ve riddled them with bullets? the dude wasn`t even armed!! I hope this cop gets convicted and gets locked up forever
Fuck the police they do everybody wrong even if u white they got that badge and think they something and can do what they want and lie on people I hope they do give this cop death penalty or get a room with bubba.
FUCK THE POLICE!!!
America is in spiritual, economic, and moral decay. I say this very clearly and shout the alarm. The worst is coming. The sins of this nation have reached heaven. The Lord God is judging this nation. We are in the 2 Timothy 3 and 2 Peter 3 generation. I am saying this as a police officer myself. I am a servant of Christ and I love others as He has loved me. I am a husband, a father, and a¬†law enforcement peacemaker. This is very disturbing to say the least. I truly feel for this mans family. You can say fear and adrenaline, whatever, make every excuse, this is unjustified. Lord have mercy on this nation. Get ready folks, get your souls, families, and houses in order. I say this as a watchman on the wall and as a peace maker. We are headed for final biblical and prophetic times unlike ever in human history. Turn to Gods Son now! Yeshua Messiah Jesus the Christ, He is coming back really soon as the Lion of Judah with justice and as a warrior. Revelation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg3GrfR2wiQ&amp;t=1156">19:16</a> The Rider on the White Horse<br>‚Ä¶15From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty. 16And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, &quot;KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.&quot;
the cop in the oscar grant shooting did 2 years in prison for killing an unarmed handcuffed man. the cops who beat kelly thomas to death ¬†walked away ¬†for that murder.these cops are all fucking cowards.all you cop lovers think it will not happen to you or your family are fucking assholes
You need to know the context before you flip out. That&#39;s called sensationalism. We have no idea what happened before the camera came upon the scene. He could have assaulted the officer (looks like there were weapons involved, stuff is all over the ground). Its whether or not you feel an officer should be able to shoot a fleeing suspect. Might I ask you, what if it was a skinhead? Usually these situations only get sensationalized when they involve black people it seems...
The guy videoing this needs to learn to hold still, the camera is all over the place.
Tennesse vs Garner 1985
Shot at 8 times, hit 5 times... then to be cuffed... and no cpr... the bastard just stands over him, while he lays dying... tragic... simply tragic.¬†
If i was a cop ,,id turn my badge in and find me another job ,,,,,the crimals get to run and the cops go to prison ,,,,,PISS ON THAT JOB &lt;&lt;&lt;
And to top it all off, no attempt to provide aftercare to a man who has just been shot up to 8 times. Doesn&#39;t look good...
I hope this cop gets the death penalty by firing squad ..live by the gun die by the gun 
oooo he&#39;s in trouuuublleeeee
So fucking sad...
Here&#39;s Bill Scott ......son murdered by cops!!<br><a href="http://williambscott.com">http://williambscott.com</a>
Wow! ¬†Unbelievable! ¬†I have no idea what this Cop was thinking. ¬†You would think with all the shootings lately that the Police would make sure it was a clear cut case before shooting someone.
Wow...WTF...Cold Hearted...Lazy...Sad...
What happened to wounding a suspect?these cops are out of control they shoot to kill 
think of all the times this has happened Not on tape - of all people.
i saw a cop fearing for his life = whats the big deal ??
don¬¥t run so you don¬¥t get shot. it is just that easy
While he deserves to go to jail, I like how nobody realizes the black male tried to taze the officer.  You can tell by it sticking out but whatever, I guess that everybody wants to hate cops for one stupid human mistake.
I&#39;m glad you got that shit on video! That was fucked up!
Disgraceful 
Freaking yellow bellied bully coward cop. And his stupid colleague, needs to frisk a¬†<br>dead guy. Shit stupid. Notice the coward telling the dead guy to put his hands behind his back. When is somebody in a position of authority over these nazis going to act?

I&#39;m too angry to write a sensible comment <br>Sorry for my extreamly bad english i&#39;m from finland
Damn man,it ¬†all looks so fake.Why did this guy run.I would never run from the cops.This mug was hiding something and you can see like a split second of a struggle right before he ran.And that thing that the cop dropped beside the man on the ground could belong to him.Right when he started running you can see something on the ground in front of them so maybe it belonged to the runner and dropped it in the struggle.I don&#39;t think that a cop would plant something in front of somebody with a cam,come on people quit trying to start shit.If he wouldn&#39;t of ran HE WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY.Its terrible what happened here.I do not believe this was a issue of black and white.Whats going to happen in this country is that NO ONE will want to be a cop and there is going to be such a shortage of them in the future because of shit like this that our stupid government like we have now is going to let the military police the people of this country and thats the communist way.Thats where we are going in this country.
This cop should be executed for murder. He is a trigger happy guy and probably a bigot. The suspect is running away and unarmed that means he should never use his gun.
¬†I have swatted mosquitos with more respect than he showed for that man&#39;s life. ¬†This is a textbook example of &quot;indefensible&quot;. ¬†Even an all white jury wouldn&#39;t do him any good.
Undoubtedly shooting and killing a suspect whilst running away is cowardly, even if you were in a brawl and your opponent is running away or is on the floor you don&#39;t finish him off. What went through the officers mind - race insinuated, felt the need to fire a couple of rounds...??? Justice will prevail.<br>This is a much lager problem however that has been around for years, maybe not so much in relation to the incident at hand. People living in fear, more so in troubled or in predominantly impoverished neighbourhoods, where gun crimes are very high.<br>Psychopaths deciding to mass kill. Homicides being broadcasted daily by the news. What better solution than having the need to arm yourself. We come back to the much debated topic again of how much power the gun industry has, especially in the U.S. Please don&#39;t come back with there are tighter gun controls already in place, having a gun is necessary or its part of the American gun culture. Absolute bull... Just compare yourself with other developed countries. Abolish guns period that would eradicate a large chunk of the problem, however that is not going happen with the gun lobby being so powerful and politicians being used like puppets. Money talks unfortunately...<br>This will go on and on, where the minority race will continue to kill each other.

Aweful!!! I cant believe that I saw this :( what the hell gave this policeman the idea to shoot him. And if that is not bad enough, 8 shots? FOR WHAT?!!¬† OMG!!!<br>My¬†thoughts go to the family of that man who was killed. I find this really hard to watch...
Fucked up listen the only reason They didnt try to cover this shit up was cause they got busted on video red handed. LOOK AT THE COP PUT SOMETHING DOWN ON THE GROUND BY HIS BODY LOOKS LIKE HE TRYIN TO PLANT SOMETHING BY HIS BODY. And then he realizes the camera guy and PICKS IT UP. WHAT HAPPENED IF THE CAMERA GUY WASNT THERE?  HE WOULD LEFT THE TASER ON THE GROUND SO HE CAN MAKE UP A BULLSHIT STORY.  I dont believe nothin these cops gotta say now about ANY unarmed shooting. 
Move along folks. There is nothing to see. Just another normal day a [Criminal On Patrol] <b>COP</b> doing its job.

Wow, that murdering bastard is as cool as a cucumber. He is not concerned at all, the other officer was more worried about the victim than that asshole that murdered him. U can see it, he was not shaken or anything. Every PIG will have his day, believe that shit. 
I don&#39;t live in the United States as i&#39;m Irish but this seems to happen a lot in your country where if you are African American you are more likely to be shot or in this case murdered in cold blood by a racist thug in a uniform.<br>This so called Cop knows he is in trouble as he then drops something maybe his gun next to the poor guy as he lay dying on the ground<br>This scumbag cop should just wear a Ku Klux Klan Uniform as he is no better than those racist filth<br>Saddest part is that if the brave guy had not filmed what happened this piece of shit cop would be on the street today<br>Prayers and condolences to the poor guys family from Ireland
Even in the old west it was considered cowardice to shot a man in the back. Hats off to the guy who captured this video who displayed a lot of courage considering he may have been the only witness. Likewise to the police force that quickly arrested this lazy, (too lazy to chase the man) cold blooded, coward murderer!!!
Fry that fuck 
We are living in a world now where the police need to be policed. ¬†That cop flat out lied in his report and would have gotten away with it too if not for the person recording this blatant lawless act. ¬†
But I keep hearing comments from everywhere like we&#39;re overreacting...like we don&#39;t get gunned down for No reason...like we&#39;re &quot;playing the race card&quot;...this sh*t breaks my heart.
So that&#39;s the United States of America, the Land of Opportunity, the Land of freedom and democracy the self announced best country in the world...
What ¬†a piece of nazi shit
This was an execution pure and simple, it deserves the death penalty and nothing less.
