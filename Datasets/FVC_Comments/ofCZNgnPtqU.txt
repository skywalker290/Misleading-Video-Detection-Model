Actual live video footage of heaven.
It is called &quot;the do not enter zone.&quot; Invitation only!!
If a barbie fan was surrounded by Oppenheimer fans
She is part of the pack
The pack moves with her, she&#39;s always at the center of the group.
Safest child on the face of the planet!

Lovely. Girl playing in a meadow with her loyal companions this is what heaven would feel like. Just being free and experiencing joy.
It&#39;s very impressive that they&#39;re tactically protecting that girl like a soldier🥰
You cant do this with Pitbulls
A glimpse of heaven here on earth
I don&#39;t understand why a German shepherd would be any more dangerous than any other dog. When that little girl, whom the pack already knew, let them out, she was probably in the safest place on earth. Had any other animal, like a bear, turned up and tried to attack the girl, they would probably have laid down their lives and defended her to their last breath.<br><br>When I was eight years old, my father brought me along to his friend, who ran a dog kennel that was breeding German shepherds, when I suddenly found myself standing on the steps to the front door porch when he apparently let out all the dogs at feeding time, and I was overtaken by seventeen German shepherds that tried to squeeze past me to get in the front door. Unless I had dressed up as a rabbit and began to dart and run around aimlessly, I was perfectly safe.<br>Not all dogs are nice; I know that, but overall, they usually get more aggressive the smaller the breed.<br><br>I fought a dog the same size as a German shepherd once, and as it attacked, I pushed my hand down his throat as I flipped him over and slammed him violently against the floor. Then I held him pinned down for a while to let him know what I thought of him. As soon as I let him loose, he tried to suck up to me and started acting like a fool in total lack of anything that would bear any resemblance to having any pride or self-esteem.<br><br>When serving in the air force, one of the German shepherds was dangerous, and he had bitten a whole bunch of servicemen. I would never have dared to try to fight that dog, so I brought my submachine gun when it was time to brush the dog, and I wouldn&#39;t have hesitated to shoot him either, and I think he understood that because he never gave me any trouble.<br><br>I love German shepherds because I can see how they feel, their mood, what they think in their eyes and facial expressions, and how they move. But when I meet a Doberman, I don&#39;t know what to think. A Doberman would beat a German shepherd every day in poker; I have no doubts about that.<br><br>I&#39;m from Sweden.
Revelation “The lion will lay down with lamb…and the child will lead them”
When you keep taming wolves you come across
She is one of the puppies. Pack will protect her
German Shepherds are SO protective of children. I speak from experience...
When you are better protected than fort knox😂
Never unattended. <br><br>.
Damn that girl is protected
Yeah, and no animal in those woods can do anything to her. Gotta love it.
100 % yes.
Girl comes home crying from school. <br><br>Dogs: Give me names.
Some people  misunderstand  a German  Shepherd  , is like a idiot  around children  they absolutely  adore them ❤  fact.l had 2 with 4 young children
How cute - ( ?) Too cute ..!
Heaven on earth. The world would be a better place if everyone had a shepherd
This could be the sweetest thing I&#39;ve ever seen....
Well, they kind of know her...
I&#39;m trying to figure WHO is having more fun.
ok💜👍👍👍👍
Can make a doggy baseball team . You can tell they love to play catch.
Absolutely amazing.  Takes the term raised by wolves to another level. The dogs look so protective and happy at the same time .all of them seem very thrilled to be there . Shes is also the leader of the pack.
Over thousands of comments saying she is the most safest girl in the world but i disagree that is the most dangerous little girl in the world
Brings back memories of my beautiful Sonya that was my best friend for 12 years.

Ignore this comment as this is a personsl msg<br><br>Good night, handsome 🌙🌸 i love u so much 🧡
What she&#39;s doing now?
I dare anyone try to hurt her .
Heaven,pure heavèn.
Some idiot breaks in<br>GSDs “meat’s back on the menu boys”
You will never see &quot;Litle girl 5 years playing with 14 Pitbulls&quot;
No way, it only wants one to turn and the pack would rip her to pieces. Dogs are a pack animal jut as wolves are.
That little girl could not be safer
Best breed of the world I own three on my channel to watch ❤
He is basically being protected by a domesticated wolf pack.
I hear those dogs have a heart of joy but i watch a man got eaten alive by one of these dogs
My Dream ❤
That’s what heaven looks like right there.
5% of all fatal dog attacks are from German Shepherds, and this girl has enough of them surrounding her that she was very likely to get killed by one of them. Also why was she ripping out flowers?
This is now the video I&#39;ll be thinking about whenever anyone asks me &quot;Where do you want to see yourself in 5 years&quot;. <br>This seems as good as anything, watching my daughter play in a meadow on my farm, with <b>some</b> of my dogs.
I think the sole danger here is something threatening her and she&#39;s dogpiled by every dog trying to defend her, the sole risk they pose.
Belle Âme à cette Enfant
Why in good hell do you have a literal pack of German Shepherds?
I believe every child needs to have an experience like this at least once in a life
If there&#39;s gonna be an image for happiness in dictionary, I want this to be.
shepards wonderfull dogs a little bit overprotective but 100% loyal when kept and tained right. In untrained hands this dogbread becomes really dangerous.
If this isn&#39;t what heaven looks like I&#39;m not going
going to the dogs?
lol... she could be near a heard of lions and nothing would reach her.
Didnt realize until another comment pointed it out but one of them is always guarding and looking out. You can see them kinda tag in and out of the &#39;play area&#39;. Adorable
One of my friends&#39; family had this dog and when my friend was very young, the dog knew it couldnt get much affection in as a result and it became jealous that he was getting the attention whilst the dog not as much. Might be certain breeds but german shepards seem to ooze loyalty and discipline
Тупая тварь цветы ломает..
dogs just wanna have fun
aah! ein gutes deutsches Mädel
That is a lot of undercoat to brush.
I wish I was her
this is how heaven looks like
She&#39;s a teenager now. I wonder if she has this as a memory...
Go near that little girl, I dare you. I double dog dare you.
Bunch of 5 year olds playing together 😊
beautiful dynamic ... lovely girl, and such powerful majestic but playful gentle beasts..
Over protection
This is what heaven looks like.
I would feel so sorry for the poor sucker who wants to mess with the little girl
This is typical dog socialization. Among children and other dogs.
You have a protective inner circle and outer circle
Each one of these pups will lay down their lives for her. 😇
This is what life is all about 😊
I would feel so safe if I was her
its like a dream
id feel bad for any rabid animals to chase her
Basically a big pack if wolves😂
What blessed day ❤❤❤❤❤

That girl is absolutely untouchable
U can see the bear in the treeline at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofCZNgnPtqU&amp;t=32">0:32</a> checking out the situation and booking it back into the forest within a second.
If this were Dark Souls, she&#39;d probably be the scariest boss in the entire series......
10€ to the dude who tries to attack her😂
Me: Who can hate this?<br>Dogs except the ones in this video: ....
Any update If any of the pups are still around 10 years later?

Imagine the dog food bill 🤯<br>Definitely worth it !
An angel, and her guardian angels.
Blessed Be He. CRcW
Today they arrest you for that
This is so wholesome. We should show this to aliens to misrepresent humanity and show that we ain&#39;t that bad.
She has a lot of really good friends. Cute video.
Starting a new character in &quot;New Game ++ &quot;
Ridiculous. Looks good but it doesn’t take much for a pack of dogs to turn nasty. No child should be left with even one dog.
Re create this ❤
Am envious, that is the happiest girl in the world
I&#39;ve NEVER seen so many beautiful Shepards at one time!!  Watching that little girl&#39;s unfettered joy made my day:)
Oh to be a little girl playing with 14 german Sheperds
Good luck to her first date
If these dogs were pitbulls they&#39;d jump out of the screen to maul we the viewers to death after eating the little girl.
I swear to god the title sounds so suss
Why was thiis suggested to me when its 10 years old? I gotta admit though, its really cute.
she was the 1 who defeated the soviet union
Well you know that she isnt getting kidnapped. Shes in good paws
14 German shepherds with diarrhea
Pit bull named cupcake gotta run.
a pack of own kind, still adores that one that&#39;s different, loads to learn from a dog.
I could watch this for an hour 😊
pretty special to see this!! thanks for uploading otherwise i missed this moment!! greetings
Oh ☺️😍 thank you for offering a real beautiful simple life to these beautiful souls 🙏💚
16m views 😊😊
German Spepherds are awesome dogs to grew up with! :)
pack❤
This is super cool. That little girl is very safe right at that moment.
Oh how I wish I was with that many dogos
Wow lots of dogs! So wonderful 😊
WOW!!!!
German Shepherds are such an amazing breed, and she is the happiest, most adorable girl! 🥰 Everyone should experience such joy. 🥹 These dogs are also having the time of their lives. Throwing grass and stalks and twigs up in the air is the best thing ever for 15 lives who all have such a deep bond. ❤
What does multiple german shepards worth if they could not even protect the little girl from ticks?
宇宙人がこれ見たら、地球人の子供はモンスター操る能力持ってるのかってビビりそう😂
i feel bad for any predator that is unlucky enough to find their way into this situation
I&#39;d love a sequel, however with 14 pitbulls instead
Never forget what they took from you…
So beautiful.
Ummm...no. I don&#39;t know about this.
This looks like reckless activity, the parents should know better, those dogs could attack in a second.
What’s black and brown all over with a white spot in the middle?<br><br><br><br><br><br>A episode of Blacked
This is really wholesome and something I really need today. My best friend who I&#39;ve since I was 3, a french brittany spaniel named Titus, died peacefully today. He was 15 and he would&#39;ve been 16 in August.<br>RIP Titus Polo, I love you, old boy, thank you for always protecting me and being there for me. May you forever run the fields and hunt lots of birds.
i would love to see someone try and get to her XD. My german just turned 10 months. Tiberius says hello!
Yes of course, the little girl is &quot;alone&quot;.
This is my dream, I love German Shepards. She is so lucky, I would be in Heaven &lt;3
This is Awesome👍 I think I spotted a few G. Shepard puppies in there as well😁
Quanto mi piacerebbe essere lì con lei!😂😂😂😂❤<br>❤❤😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Can you please adopt me? I would love to live and work on your little slice of heaven. I am disciplined and work hard. I’m an expert lumberjack. Thank you for the consideration. I have a YouTube channel.
And if for some reason they ran out of food they would lay down and die before hurting the child.
Alexa, show me a video of heaven, please
The definition of “wholesome”
Why?
Man, some of those dogs are probably dead… it sucks to know,<br>Very wholesome though. ❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
I want to know about this girl and her dogs..... WE NEED AN UPDATE FFS
Jesus bless you ❤ I love people who teach their children to love dogs ❤🐕🐕🐕
If those dogs were pitbulls she&#39;d of been dead
it&#39;s a nice video, but i can&#39;t help but imagine the state of this comment section if those were pitbulls 💀
all dog R.I.P
That’s the pack alpha right there alright, and clearly a loved one at that.
Dissenting view:  This is scary.  One unlucky moment is all it takes.<br><br>No one should imagine that the circumstances and results depicted here can necessarily be replicated elsewhere.
Try this with other breeds of dogs that will not be named...
i bet a PDF file looiking at the woods
Think, we domesticated dogs so that this is a wholesome heartwarming moment could happen, and not the most vicious and gorey video imagineable.
Finally a beautiful wholesome video, thanks for recommending me this 10 years later.
Do the German shepherds know each other apart? Do they realize they all look alike? Do they get each other mixed up? Do they realize they are all German shepherds?
Leader of the pack.
ill fear for anyone trying to break into that house
this is so me when I was a kid lol
I love how she authentically matches their energy😩❤️
Now let a child play with 14 pitbulls
Imagine, when she gets older, she will have an army of trained german shepards guarding her... i will name them the paw patrol 😂
The ones that are closest to her are so cute with their jumps!
No coyotes in this area😂😂😂😂
These german shepherds are nicer and non thinkers compared to humans that just want to see the world burn and nothing else. Just compare humans in packs vs Dogs in packs
Looks like a field of friends to me
Need to sign of of those dogs up, good vertical.
Behold, THE CANINE QUEEN<br><br>Optional boss in the Fields of Fang, lowest HP of any boss in the game but her minions&#39; attack power is extremely high and their speed is even higher. Well-timed dodges and parries are the key to winning this difficult battle.<br><br>Upon being defeated, the Queen will drop a magical artifact called the Shepherd Summoner that can summon canine minions to aid you in battle.
1 day later, the house is crawling with ticks
If she’s in Germany would we only call them shepherds?
She tried throwing a stick or ball but it was too hectic with 14 dogs. Now she throws grass so everyone has a chance to catch some.
i challenge anyone to try to kidnap this girl
Come on kidnappers do something, I dare you, fact I double dog dare you, you know what I 14 dog dare you.
I won&#39;t have balls to play with even 1 lol
Some dogs are okay, I guess……lol
She&#39;s literally living my dream...🤩♥️🩷
now do little girl 5 years playing with 14 pitbulls
To be honest. This is really scary.
This is so simple yet so precious. Future generations will look back at this video and admire the joy this little girl had with these dogs just the way we are now! 😊
that&#39;s just scary ..... I was attacked by a German shepherd before
Ya no hay nada k proteger.😢
I don&#39;t know about you all, but this seems like a piece of heaven and a dream come true!
Couldn&#39;t be dumber
this might be the most wholesome video of all time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofCZNgnPtqU&amp;t=24">0:24</a> that dog got talent....
Just as awesome as it was 10 years ago!
That home stank
I don&#39;t think even a father with a belt or an asian mother with a slipper could raise an arm against her...
Nope. Can’t convince me nothing can go wrong. Sorry
This is what heaven looks like😇
The girl&#39;s joyful &quot;wohoos&quot; and the dogs&#39; plaufulness and being so protective on her is just absolute happyness.
That girl would be 15 now! Bet she still loves dogs.
In an alternate universe that little girl is just some guy who lost the bet and now must fight 14 german shepards in an open field with one of those starter kits.
Oh damn, german shepherds with a straight back!! You don’t see that very often
this video makes me wish that I have pets.
I challenge anyone to answer honestly and tell me a smile did not come to your face @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofCZNgnPtqU&amp;t=22">0:22</a> the first time you watched this video
I had two shepherds when I was a kid, and I plan on getting one when I&#39;m an old lady for protection someday. Until then though I got weenies! XD
This is the most wholesome thing I&#39;ve seen all day. ❤️
Germany Shepard 😐
I wonder if she still loves dogs this much today. She&#39;d be about 15/16 years old now.
Thats so cute
Imagine all those shepherds sitting in the corner without making any sound and that young girl playing be herself and a kidnapper tries to kidnap her not know there were german shepherds as her body guards and suddenly 14 german shepherds running towards him barking aggressively 💀
теперь понятно Кто в поле стал ходить<br>И пшеницу шевелить.
Couldn&#39;t be safer
Thats cute, now imagine the 14 pitbulls
This video feels surreal. Like a dream I never had
Safest girl in the world. Just try and get close to her, go on, I dare you.
Bro i only see white dot and 14 black dots around the white dot
It’s pretty hard to entertain FOURTEEN German shepherds, but she did it!  Her game was perfect: just run around and have fun while she yells and throws grass in the air.  I noticed that the dogs did two things they love: run around excitedly, and protect the little human at the same time.  I don’t think it was a coincidence that the dogs formed a protective circle around her.
this was my dream but with rottwailers ❤
They protec 😅
If these were pitbulls she wouldnt hsve lasted 30 seconds
OMG, you&#39;d wish every girl could grow up like that.<br>I wonder how she looks back on that now, 10 years later.
Me before reading:&quot; aaaaw😊&quot;<br>Me after reading 10 years ago:&quot; where is German Shepard pack....are they safe? Are they alright? 😢&quot;
if there&#39;s a herd of german shephards.. which one is doing the shepharding??
That is Z+ security right there
My two boys live in the house. We don&#39;t have a burglar alarm<br>Imagine breaking into their house and 14 of these guys are like &quot;sup?&quot;
Looks AI generated except its 10 years old so can&#39;t be.
mans best K-9 squad
This video made my day 😊 so cute
security max
Looks like footage from the paradise 😳
Raised by wolfs..
Mine is currently laying between my legs on my bed… asleep! This girl is a very lucky little girl to have so much love around her!
that is the cutest thing i have seen in my entire life
If they where pitbulls she would’ve been everywhere on that field.
That&#39;s my childhood dream..<br>𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗗𝗢𝗚𝗦.
Looks like heaven
Parents are lucky none of the dogs was hungry
The dogs have an inner circle with the girl in the middle surrounded by dogs a couple of dogs outside the circle scouting and dogs in the middle constantly checking around it’s a natural response to protect the child in the middle like elephants
This is the whitest thing ive ever seen
That&#39;s either a lot of poop to clean up or a lot of poop to avoid whenever you take a step.
How sweet😊 what are their names?
So cute and wholesome how they protect her.
That girl has the best guardian angels one can imagine! ☺
Minecraft players when the tame the max amount of dogs in one world.
I love the grass-jumping dog.
Meanwhile, in the retarded states:<br>Little boy 6 years shoots teacher. ( No, really it actually happened, Google it. )
THAT’S SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>I’d be in heaven if that were me. I love dogs.  I prefer them over most people.
It could be very dangerous as dogs if anything happens , if one gets crazy and bites, can turn into a very aggressive pack... and kill.
Whoever messes with this little girl is a very dead person
This is prob what entering heaven looks like
That little girl clearly loves theo&#39;s dogs but they love her
I noticed about half of those are puppies, i remember when mine was a puppy, they are the cutest things in the world!
seems to me everybody is filled with the joys of life......especially the one on two legs.............
Replace those with pitbulls, that would be a different story
Nature. Dogs. Simplicity.<br><br>That is happiness.
Looks like heaven to me!
&quot;Where do you see yourself in five years?&quot;<br>This 😂❤
If it was 14 pitbulls shed be dead
Well...I don&#39;t think I could afford to feed 14 GS....
so many gsd lol
copy paste
1 German Shepherd= A lot of broken vacuum cleaners, a lot of opera singing, lots of weird noises and even stranger facial expressions….now multiply that by 14 lol.
How cute it is. And also she is so protected just like Princess w/ 14 knights around 😂.
Z+++++++....... Security 😁
when u breed all the wolfs in minecraft
Kid got her own personal Impawssible mission force
Safest kid on planet even more safe Bryan mills daughter
Tiger in the bush: ok, some other day then 😒
I think the author of the video managed to catch pure, unadulterated literal joy on film, here, haha.  Honestly, though, what could be more heartwarming than empathizing with a small child, out in a big magical field (but watched over by a parent so they feel safe) playing with 14 big puppies who absolutely love them because they&#39;re casting out big handfuls of food.  That&#39;s just gotta be a super-happy moment and memory for that kid :).
I think there are fifteen
I want to be there
I ,couldn&#39;t play with one German shepherd.i was walking on sidewalk.Big dog jump over his fence.i was a teenager .
I’m glad the video cut off before the dogs started tearing her apart
That is cool as ice....
❤❤
Wow, that must be nice - even the vicious dogs are friendly and happy in Norway. I wouldn&#39;t know: I&#39;m from the USA.
You just know.
its likr my 6 zigzagoons to pickup rare candies
I pity the fool, man or beast, who tries to fuck around with this one.
One bad dude takes a single step towards her and he&#39;s ground hamburger meat.
I hope those ugly muts ate her, I mean that is why you left her with rabid dogs
German girls and German shepherds
A ten+ year update video in this same style would be awesome
Sounds like shrimpnerd 😅😂😂
better protected than the president,  and more fun to be around
This is awesome, man ❤
Clickbait
Looks like a moment from drama-family movie
Their instinct to protect her  as they consider part of their pack,pure and simple. Whoever tries to think of harming her,god help them,cause then you will find out how dangerous  14 sheperds truely can be. There is a reason why they are most law enforcement agencies number 1 choice of canine &quot;officer&quot; with good reason. I raised 2 sheperds and there is not a day goes by I still miss them.
Try and step 1 meter next to that and you finna go streight back to the Apollo 1 incident 💀
She&#39;s definitely safe!
Man, that one Shepard was like, &quot;My only job in life to catch every object this human throws.&quot;
imagine someone tried to harm that girl bahahah they wouldent live long
gamen ooveer when she stops...u62z0000&amp;7ugouotodown34t55555555u66ritiypoup%
Imagine a bear is done doing it&#39;s business in the woods, and approaches the girl. Every one of those dogs would be standing in the middle.
This video is 10 years old, all those dogs are probably dead now. Have a nice day.
Go! Bwah!
this must be heaven on earth
That&#39;s probably the most protected property lol
Never forget what they took from you
If anything tried to hurt that gir even a grizzly I bet those German shepherds would tear it apart in an instant
Diese Situation ist so gefährlich! Da könnte man das Kind auch mit einer geladenen Glock  spielen lassen. 😮
The happiest girl on the world. ❤
This is way better than that “Little girl torn to shreds by 14 pittbulls” vid.
Well no burglar will be breaking into that home
Official: My favorite video of all times!
She&#39;s having the time of her life lol. It&#39;s nice to see kids having fun in nature with animals.
Pitbull
What a lucky child.
I cant believe it they all look the exact same
Look at that girl destroy that lovely field. 😥 Jk
Prayers to kidnapper who will attempt to take her
They are really guarding her. Just lovely.
Doggos like hooman pups.
Henry was our sable German Shepherd 130lb wonder dog,  lived to be 13 . Loved to swim and retrieve trees :-) we miss him
Just young pups
The dogs know that she&#39;s the offspring of the alpha male. Who&#39;s videoing. They know their place. It&#39;s what good training teaches them.<br>Back in Zanzibar, where I was born a long, long time ago, we used to have an German Shepherd called Prince. There wasn&#39;t anything I couldn&#39;t do to that dog. he was that devoted and protective of me. Sadly, when the Zanzibar revolution happened, we had to be evacuated and had to leave him behind.
Shepherd of the shepherds.
No stranger are ever dare to touch her
The epitome of happiness right there!
German Shepherd heaven!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofCZNgnPtqU&amp;t=20">0:20</a> What a jump
This is heaven. If I could trade my life with hers...
Good luck to any thief trying to break in to their home. Better come with a body bag for them to put you in
No one dares to try to harm her !!❤
Omg this is my dream she’s living out for me 💜💜😂
I remember when I started dating my mom told me to bring the boy home and if the dog didn&#39;t like him toss him to the curb. Could you imagine bringing him home to that? He&#39;d either run for his life or be so busy petting them all you&#39;d never leave the house.
This girl found a spawn of German Shepherds
Place look so peaceful.
Nayuta?!
Gee wizz ma...do ya maybe think that if that kid did something accidently...to say one of the puppies...the pack might have decided she was a threat and attack her, leading to severe injury of death!
Puppy mill for German Shepards?!
Anybody tries to harm that little furl, they are going to have one confusing attack sequence.
Is this what heaven looks like
Awesome video
Real-life Princess Mononoke
Ain&#39;t NOBODY gonna mess with this little girl!!!  This is so wholesome.
I dunno if its the same dog doing the HOP every time she throws something in the air, but that&#39;s so cute.
I pity the poor person who would dare approach her.
friend pushes her over <br>14 german shepards <br>💀🔴💦
How do you protect your child from coyotes and strangers.......
They are not hungry
I wish if there’s ever really a heaven, it is like this. <br><br>Where all the goodest boys and all kids who lost their boys abruptly can be together again in the Avalon of love.

Me and my Minecraft dog
I could do that for the rest of my life.
The only correct solution to child care in a rural environments.
The best type of dog
Alternate title: 5 year old with an army of German Shepherds absolutely terrorizes a field of flowers... Trees in the distance fear they will be next.
Well protected no one coming to her i see thank god xx
Thats whitepilling.
As a fellow German Shepherd I can assure you that any stranger who dares to mess up with that kid would be eaten alive. Trust me, try it ❤<br>GSD sometimes jump in front of bullets and knives to protect their owners. And this is a whole army, and she is the owner&#39;s child. If provoked, that pack right there is more dangerous than an entire battalion.
That&#39;s the safest little girl on the planet. Black Knight Security team. None shall pass
Some of the canines are puppies. One thing is sure, nothing is coming for this kid or the puppies, not even a grisly bear would try.
That’s one well-protected little girl!
Pity the 1st person who try’s to talk to her 😊
Some of those dogs are still alive. They may even be multiplying. Her dog army will consume all.
I don&#39;t see any German Sheperds. <br>I see a small child with her group of body guards/ babysitters.
With some good camera shot and dramatic song, it&#39;s gonna be a Disney movie scene.
She&#39;s was playing with those dogs for 5 years. I hope she has rested well enough since
... Unless it&#39;s a German Shepherd, it&#39;s just a dog.
I wonder how many animals close by they have killed, including other people&#39;s pets ? They&#39;re dogs, it&#39;s a dog pack.  They&#39;re only cute if you&#39;re a part of the pack.
Better the the Presidential Secret Service!
Kind of weird to think about the fact that the girl is now 15 and quite a few of those dogs are probably dead.
I&#39;m sure people with pit bulls will think it safe to let their child play with them too.
I love the one who comes running in at about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofCZNgnPtqU&amp;t=30">0:30</a>.<br><br>&quot;Guys!  I found a stick!  Hey guys! STICK! Who wants to play with stick?  Hey!  Hey!  Hey, guys!  I found a stick!  You all wish you had stick!  But it&#39;s my stick!  Ha ha!  Stick!&quot;
A child has never been safer..
Pov: you are a masculine man with a strong family and a daughter who you wanna protect
Part 2. Girl gets mauled by 14 German Shepards. Coming soon to a youtube channel near you.
16 years ago ...damn
Blessings from 🇦🇺
Even clinton could not touch her.
What a BEAUTIFUL video. That’s heaven 🥹🙏
U can leave her out all night I dare a rapist or kidnapper to walk up they want walk back
God bless
she couldn’t be any safer.
Not a good idea.
They don’t even want to eat the grass, they’re just doing it to make her happy
Good thing it wasn&#39;t 14 Pit Bulls, or they wouldve torn her to shreds
Check for ticks all that long grass. It’s April in MN but found 1 on my dig already.
Watching the kid pull up grass in a funny video: 😄😊<br>Watching the kid pull up grass in a documentary about grass: 😠😰
She&#39;s the most safest girl on the planet😊😊
This reminds me of a dream I never had.
I tell you what. If anyone even looked  cross eyed at that little girl, those dogs would rip them   to shreds.
In the presence of much more trustworthy creatures than humans.
That&#39;s a lot of fun for one girl to be having!
If this is heaven, and I think it is........send me now.
A German shepherd saved my life when I was 4. This is HEAVEN!!
iNnoCeNT liTTle ChIlD ViCioUsLY AtTaCkeD bY MaRauDinG PaCk oF WiLd DoGS.. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>What PETA would say.
Absolutely beautiful.
There needs to be a sheep off to the side that keeps all the dogs in line
It’s a beautiful sight….but wondering if all those pups are her family or I would be worried a bit?
Very intelligent German Shepherds and not so intelligent gayest crack cocaine Donald Trump.
You know for a fact that if she disappeared into the wilderness with even half of those dogs then she&#39;s fine :)
Nice to see her pack :)<br>This Kid is 1400% safe for every thret!<br><br>Best from Germany
I once had 4 large (75lb plus) female Dobermans when in lived in the US and my young daughter would spend hours in their company playing just like this without a care or fear in the world.
What kind of Shepherds????
oh to be a child playing with German Sheperds in a field of wildflowers
My Sheba used to jump up and catch grass. Just like that......been 30 years now...😔 Bless you for posting this .
Full time job hauling all that kibble home, goodness.
What are the odds that she stepped on a brown grenade?😂💩
That is the safest child on the planet!
Yea I don’t trust dogs this much to ever allow my daughter around that many dogs
I&#39;m 37 and 1/2 and this memory will stay with her forever just like my German shepherds memory stays with me, she refused to go outside every night before she said good night would scratch and paw the door all night if she didn&#39;t get let in, most loyal dog I&#39;ve ever had, RIP Nicky
One of them is Austrian
I loved every dog I had, can&#39;t imagine to have 14 awesome friends instead of one
Oh awesome, she is part of the pack, they accept her. I tried to join my runaway dog &quot;Troubles&quot; when I was her age. He joined a pack of wild dogs in the mountains where I used to live. I approached the pack to join one day, but Troubles had to give me a bite to show me he broke ties with humans. I could see he was under pressure from the big dogs to do this. I understood it all later. lol
She seems so happy 😊
life could be a dream!      da da di dum di dum .....
This was 10 years ago.  I’m guessing the girl grew up safely and wouldn’t surprise me if she now owns a GSD or two!
The GS is the most perfect dog in the world. I could only dream about having 14 at once. But if I could, I would in a heartbeat. Put my black GS to sleep in January and I still miss her dreadfully.
2, maybe 4 seconds in the entire video where there wasn&#39;t one of them quickly scanning the tree line for movement even during play.<br>Situational awareness, this breed is one of the best. Even during fun &amp; games, there&#39;s still that instinct kicking in.
This is what I envision the other side of the rainbow bridge looking like.
Meanwhile across the field: &quot;some kid and her dogs keep on ripping up and throwing all my flowers&quot;
This video captures what are arguably the greatest marvels of Earth.
Love to see this....a sick pedophile freak wouldn&#39;t get within 20 feet of that little girl before those dog&#39;s would eat him for lunch...there is unfortunately the risk of those beautiful dogs becoming sick however,...so I always keep Mr. Ruger handy and a rope can also be very useful
I have now seen everything
I can totally see their instincts go &quot;destroy her, bite her, eat her&quot; but less than a milisecond later you see their training kick in and instead play
Aww 🥰
Paradise
When &quot;V&quot; is stuck while &quot;Ctrl+C&quot; ~ &quot;Ctrl+V&quot;
That&#39;s enough shepherd to kill a entire ecosystem in this forest obviously only if you&#39;d let them and if they were wild but what i&#39;m trying to say is that this pack could most definitely survive anywhere on earth i&#39;d even lean myself so far out the window and claim that they could possibly even survive in the Savannah in Africa battling with Hyenas and Lions truly amazing dogs and very strong in a group that big
where there hoomans there food!
Little white devil
There&#39;s jus not enough throwing hands for that many fetching mouths!
I hope she did not grow up to be a Karen.
She is Alpha
PURE JOY
Aww they&#39;re jumping up for her.
that field must be full of dog shite, wonderful. 😐
That’s one way to protect a child, an army of doggo’s wrapped around a child’s innocence.<br>I fear for those who’d try to harm a hair on her head, the repercussions would be the equivalent of a Raptor pack hunting you down.
There are people who don&#39;t like dogs. Can you believe that?
&quot;Sir, 75 large bags of dog food? Are you trying to tell me you&#39;re being kidnapped..?&quot;<br><br>😬
This is what I imagine the Rainbow Bridge to be.  Endless days of carefree playing in a field with our beloved furbabies.
That&#39;s what I want to grant to my future children
Great dogs.. Absolutely great
Thanks youtube
3 more years till breeding time
Once upon a time, in a village nestled within an enchanted forest, there lived a little girl named Elara. At first glance, Elara seemed like any other child her age, with her innocent face and big brown eyes. But she had a secret that only she and her parents knew: Elara was not just a little girl, but a monster too.<br><br>The enchanted forest was a magical place filled with wondrous creatures and unimaginable beauty. However, it was also the home of the dreaded crunchy wolves, terrifying beasts that would prey upon the inhabitants of the village. No one knew where they had come from, but the villagers lived in constant fear of their attacks.<br><br>One day, as the sun began to set, the village was abuzz with the news that the last of the crunchy wolves had been vanquished. The villagers gathered in the center of town, excitedly chattering about their newfound safety. A brave man named Jasper had defeated the final crunchy wolf, and he proudly shared his tale with everyone.<br><br>&quot;There are no more crunchy wolves in the forest,&quot; he announced, a triumphant smile spreading across his face. The villagers erupted into cheers, grateful for their newfound peace.<br><br>Little Elara, who had been listening intently, could not help but feel a sense of melancholy. As a monster herself, she had always felt a kinship with the misunderstood creatures. While she never condoned their violent actions, she understood that they, too, were products of their environment.<br><br>That night, Elara&#39;s parents could sense her sorrow. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, sweetheart?&quot; her mother asked, wrapping her arms around her daughter.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s just... I feel sad for the crunchy wolves,&quot; Elara whispered, her voice cracking. &quot;They were monsters, like me. They didn&#39;t choose to be that way.&quot;<br><br>Her father hugged her tightly. &quot;Elara, you must remember that you are not like the crunchy wolves. You have a good heart, and you use your monstrous abilities for good, not harm.&quot;<br><br>As the days went by, the village returned to a life of peace and happiness. Yet, Elara could not shake the feeling that she needed to do something to honor the memory of the crunchy wolves. One day, while exploring the enchanted forest, she stumbled upon a hidden cave. Her curiosity piqued, she decided to enter.<br><br>Inside the dimly lit cave, Elara discovered a group of small, frightened creatures huddled together. They were baby crunchy wolves, orphaned by the recent battles. Her heart went out to them, and she knew what she had to do.<br><br>Elara decided to adopt the baby wolves and raise them as her own. She taught them to be kind and gentle, using their monstrous abilities to protect the village and the enchanted forest. In time, the little girl and her newfound family formed a unique bond, as they all learned to embrace their dual nature.<br><br>Through her love and guidance, Elara transformed the once-dreaded crunchy wolves into noble guardians of the village. And in doing so, she not only found her own purpose but also showed the villagers that monsters could be forces of good, too.<br><br>From then on, whenever the villagers spoke of the girl who had tamed the crunchy wolves, they did so with admiration and gratitude. For they knew that within her monstrous heart, there lay a spirit of kindness and compassion that had made their world a safer and more harmonious place.
Mr presidents daughter
The hills are alive
In only a split second…
The way all children should be , having fun with friends and not a care in the world .
So this is what heaven looks like
Heaven on earth 🌈 🌍
Damn, I wish I had this army when I was a kid 😅
Such a horribly idiotic idea. One of the most violent dog breeds on the planet. There&#39;s a reason cops use them.
She is the Queen.
She must be part of the kennel owner&#39;s family, feeding and petting the dogs every day. A cousin of mine used to have a GS when he was a boy, and the dog was friendly to him only but dangerous to everyone else, including the cousin&#39;s brother or their parents.
They check in with mom from time to time.
Thank God they are well fed!
Crazy that I didnt hear a single bark out of 14 dogs.
They make great babysitters. That girl is better protected than a U.S. president.
I remember when I was a toddler I was always surrounded by our 4 Dobermans that my father gifted each of his Children and one to my mother in my baby pictures those dogs were always there now i have a silly lil cat lol miss them
14 protectors!  Love to see!
Satan himself wouldn&#39;t be able to touch her right now.
The absolute best protection little blondie can ever have
She is obviously the Alpha of the pack.
That day she was the German shepherd
the blks and liberals hate this.
Best life ever for all parties present!
So that&#39;s what happiness is...
Me with my dogs in minecraft:
That&#39;s pure beauty right there.
Destroyer of lands !
The bill for tick treatment must be criminal.
Oh what I wouldn&#39;t give to be a child playing with German Shepherds in a big meadow.
So many cute puppies!
the meaning of life.
That&#39;s closest to heaven..
Happy dogs. Happy girl. Nice to see.
Pure heaven ❤
Safer than most Presidents.
the dogs ate well that day
Probably one of the most heartwarming videos I’ve ever seen.
Still dangerous. Even if they are friendly, they may get too excited. My dog loved me and nearly poked my eye out trying to play
Poor doggy with the stick got confused if he got the rules wrong
When I die,  I was to be reincarnated as a little blonde girl in a pink outfit Alpha surrounded by German Shepards.
that was the last time she was seen<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>she got adopted by them
So happy, they’re jumping for joy! And grass! Dang near looks like German Shepherds and the German Black Forest!
Imagine her playing with 14 pit bulls....
Groomers on suicide watch
The two GSD at the front in the beginning stay together the whole video and Dog # 2 repeatedly circles Dog # 1 without leaving Dog # 1. Are they a mating pair or what? So beautiful and loyal.
10 years ago... This is history... Nowaday kids have their face stuck into their phone/console/computer/tablet/.... Quite sad...
Litle
And if there&#39;s aggression between even just two of the dogs and then redirected aggression to the child?
these are dogssssss
❤
Who got tired first? The child or the puppy? 😂😂
Child endangerment. Parents should be arrested
This is too gorgeous and she is well protected,  I can assure you❤❤❤❤
Beautiful dogs! Their master is precious too.😅
When I die I hope this is what heaven looks like.
Still probably my favorite video ever.
😻🌻🙏❤️
Where was this filmed? Heaven?
She have the most wonderful memories in her entire life.
360° security maintained at all times. No-one those dogs don’t trust is getting within 10 metres of that little girl.
Absolutely nothing to see here.
She couldn&#39;t be any safer with Seal Team 6.
Thats a ton of dog turd land mines
That is the safest little girl in the world.
💘🥂🧸
I wish i was married so that when my wife ask what i want on birthday, i how this. Life goals.
Many parent,’s life goals.
Oh, heck no.  If those dogs would of snapped she&#39;d be dead
US president: I have the best protection detail in the world!<br>5yo girl: hold my sippy-cup.
no wild animal is coming near this girl
The most wholesome video ever.
For a $1,000,000 try to grab that little girl.
Me ek YouTube su📽
I don’t think any person animal or alien would try to fool with this little one !
What a wolfpack!
K9 Scorestreak in a nutshell.
X13
I dare someone to try and kidnap the little girl😂😂
I can die happy now that I have seen this many GSD&#39;s in one place
I love this girls parents. This is how life is to be lived. She is getting an amazing experience. I would never live in a city, ever.
Is this what heaven looks like?
GS are the best dog breed ever......this little girl is in Fort Knox over there. Safe.
When I die and pass on from this earth, I pray this is what I wake up to. Being a little boy, playing with all the dogs that have passed before me.
most protected girl on the planet at the moment
If you never had one, you&#39;ll just not &quot;get it.&quot; My Princess was almost 17 when I just had to put her down. I made a casket for her. Nailed screwed and glued. Caulked. Sealed tight. It took 2 of my friends and I to lower her into the ground. And that was in the dead of winter when it took me hours to melt through the frost. I made a promise that before I died I would honor her by trying to get another. Not a replacement for sure, but maybe just maybe a legacy. We have a Yorkie now and he&#39;s nuts and great. I&#39;d love to pair him up with a German Shepherd puppy. Now THAT would be funny.
Amazing......
<b>Core memory unlocked</b>
I would say that that is dangerous if I did not know German Shepards.
They are the most beautiful dogs in the world.
Maxi protection la 😁
Strange
Who&#39;s dog&#39;s are they?  Very interesting!
That girl is a Stark lol
Thanos gonna think 14 times before he can even think of touching that girl.
This is still Heart warming to watch,  Love How a Few jump  Up &amp; catch the Grass Shes throwing. Any one wants to Do Her Harm  Will have Over a Dozen Snarling teeth waiting For Them.
.
🙀
That&#39;s alot of dog poop to scoop up on a daily basis.
Her protectors .
Imagine a lone wolf prowling up to her. The germans would have gone from play to protect/attack mode.
Gjb
looks to me like she is their Alpha. 🥰
Lovely, so happy Pernille found her passion. 🙏
La petite fille fait partie de la meute 🐶
Incredibly wholesome to watch to bring a smile apon thy face, beautiful memory for that child to look back on..🥰
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofCZNgnPtqU&amp;t=24">0:24</a> that is treasure trove dog. I never seen that jump shepherd could jump high.

Having been bitten as a child by a German shepherd that turned nasty for absolutely no reason this makes me very nervous and mine was not the only story I heard about this breed turning on a sixpence for no reason.
This is what the Jews hate
Brave girl
I pity anyone that messes with that little girl!
我的妈也！
Why can&#39;t I join them? I barely eat! 👏😍😆
I miss childhood. 🥰🥰🥰
where did the dogs come from?
Todos son felices amados y bendecidos
German Shepherds are proof God wants us to be happy.
Now that&#39;s what childhood should look like!
you need some dogfrisbee and balls
🤣😅
Guardian 👍
I wish I always had one but don&#39;t have the money to buy one
Beautiful dogs.Beautiful place.
Are they alive today 😐😐 😢
O que a menina está jogando para o alto ?<br>Muito legal. <br>Amei.<br>Obrigado e abraços aqui do Amâncio de Piracicaba São Paulo Brasil
실수로라도 저 아이 건드렸다간<br>즉시매우빠른속도로 뼈도못추릴만큼 저세상갈거같다<br>너무든든한 댕댕이들
Sweet
All those pups just having a blast with their best buddy.
The most consistently-wonderful dog in the world. 🔥👊
🙏a blessing 🙏😇
ชั่งเป็นธรรมชาติที่น่ารักกกกค่ะ  👍👍👍👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐❤❤❤❤
RARELY SEEN SUCH VIDEO...<br>GOD BLESS HER....
U
no one said German Shepard&#39;s are dangerous , you must have been thinking about pit bulls  they are dangerous to anything that&#39;s alive. and all of them need killing .
😊
Fantastisk!  Slik skal det være!
My Dad would have loved this...he had 5 GSDs simultaneously growing up.
Om looking at this on Aug. 1, 2022 which would make her 14 years old. Wish this could be updated. Beautiful. Wonderful loyal pets.
I&#39;ve known alot of nice shepherds but it creeps me out after my brother was mauled by one at age 10. He barely survived it but I know any ind of dog could have done it
Fantástico  saúde
Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
No; she&#39;s teasing them!Stupid girl n selfish!
That’s great. That warms the heart.
That would be very scary if they not trained.
Experts predict it would take 8 grown German shepherds to Kill an adult male lion , this family threw in 6 extra for protection.
The dogs appear to be having as much fun as the little girl is having.
And anyone with bad intentions approaches this girl and is mauled beyond recognition. They seem to be very protective of her.
VERY   VERY   VERY  LUCKY GIRL🍀🍀🍀
Please teach her to be respectful to Mother Earth. No ripping out flowers She&#39;s had enough pillaging and disrespect from your kind.
What a beautiful scene. Glad this wasnt one of those videos where it goes horribly wrong.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofCZNgnPtqU&amp;t=22">0:22</a> ... that dog jumps....
That is just precious 🖤🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🖤 I would love to be there with the little girl 💚👼🏼💚
She is the Alpha 👸🏼🙌🏽😎
All dogs are different. I have been training since 1959.
Maybe it&#39;s just me but the caption seems to imply that it is somehow dangerous for a little girl to play with a pack of shepards... To me it seems that the caption suggests that this romp in the field with a little girl is unusual?? <br><br>Well, as there is no doubt that those dogs know her, and even if they didn&#39;t know her, the chance of her being in any danger is actually extremely small unless one of those dogs was not socialized and tending to pose a threat to anyone for any reason. So, she is probably as safe from any intrusion or outside danger as she could ever be (in her life).  If those dogs got the slightest wiff of anything that could pose any kind of trouble to that little girl, they&#39;d be on it like white on rice and most likely intimidate anyone or anything that they did not trust. Shepards are rambunctious clowns and they&#39;re like little kids until they have reason to go on alert... Then, look out stranger, you will be surrounded and rendered scared shitless.
Qué hermosa manada de Pastor Alemán y la custodia que tienen para esa bonita pequeña .
A pack of wuffs.
This is a beautiful post, it shows how animals dogs in particular respect humans. And they have fun at the same time. Thank you for this post. Today is July 27th 2022. A dog is a man&#39;s best friend. Treat them with love and respect, and they will do the same to you.
Beauty and the beasts!  How wonderful 😇
Lucky little girl. They’re all having fun.
Этож как надо любить псов, чтобы так их радовать. Умница и красавица и очень хорошая женщина.
I wouldn&#39;t let my child do that unless I was armed with a gun and standing within10ft.
This is the most dangerous thing to do for a child .. irresponsible parents those dogs can attack her at any time
Muito amor 💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘<br>Nota 1000mil pra você irmão
Dogs will be dogs
German Shepherd is most noble dog
WoW 15 of them never see that manny so cute and that gril like come Play 😂
She is so lucky to have so many dogs around her.  Keeping so many dogs will cost a lot of money.🤩
<b>Grass is the new ball folks..</b>
Ну, судя по хвостам и экстерьеру, то это скорее восточно-европейская овчарка, а не немец в чистом виде. У немцев и хвост трубой вниз, никаких тебе колец, и круп посажен ниже. А так видео отменное, позитив и милота!!!
Kidnapper: hehehehehehehe<br>14 German Shepherds: <b>Dare approach her, we will bite your balls off.</b>
Those dogs must be very brave

There is no chance for a 🐻 to attack
Son would have been better
NEW SUB
That means she is well protected and loved
Made me laugh!!!<br>Dogs are catching every stalk.<br>Happy good video.
In about 15 years or so they turn into Waahman!!😢😥
So full of life!
I want to join the pack toooo ❤️
I love these dogs. Their natural instincts on full display is glorious.
Safest little girl in the world
I&#39;d say she pretty safe out there.
Cant disrespect the boss
It&#39;s all fun and games till you find out this is just another level in the backrooms
I luv German Shepherds! I had two that I cared for.  They are now in Rainbow Bridge—- I miss all my family pets.
So sweet when just throwing up grass got the dogs jumping up to play and frolic. Love in simplicity. Who&#39;d have thought. 🌹
<b>German Shepherds</b> ......great dogs!!!👍
Nice to see, but not totally without risk.
❤️❤️💪
Ее родители самые безголовые и безответственные  дебилы. И все ради этого видео и лайков?
dogs: let&#39;s keep the statusquo, the world will be ours!
Oooo how sweet 😢
Well she doesn’t have to worry about anything!
Lol this is my dream but with golden retriever. Lucky lol 😂
the little girl&#39;s evil parents should be arrested and that little girl be put in custody for putting her in harmsway!!
Little
I didn&#39;t understand for the beginning what is going on. So many dogs. I&#39;ve never seen such number of dogs in the same place. I thought they throw her onto the ground. But this is very funny. Dozen funny dogs and one little girl. Very funny.
Okay, but by the way it&#39;s spelled &quot; little&quot;.
Most protected little princess on the planet, they all adore her and you can tell. Such sweet babies &lt;3
This IS THE LIFE! 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Heaven
Dogs feel more than what we think! They will kill for her.
I wonder how many are still alive.
how?
I&#39;ll pay anyone 100.000 dollars go touch this child go I der u go let&#39;s see what the Shepards do to u i bet there&#39;s no comeing back I guess
Wow she has alot of bodyguards.
What a cute video
No creature on earth would dare come near that little girl.  German Shepards are extremely protective of thier owners.
I needed that this morning.
I wanna see video when the first boy comes calling! Lol 😂
Herding Shepards
Cuteness overload.
They jump up to catch the grass. Pure joy.
The best all around FAMILY dog breed as far as I&#39;m concerned 💯❣
Thanks for sharing this much love
I want one of them!!
This whole scene looking like a fairy tale
this would be the BESTEST DAY EVER! What a lucky lil girl to be able to grow up with such BEAUTIFUL critters. I got my first rescue GSD 8 years ago now. He&#39;s never far from my side, and NEVER fails to remind me just how beautiful each and every day is. There WILL be more GSDs in my life!
aha  fun time 🤗
Thé Queen of shepherds <br>They love her<br>And would  risk their own life for her<br>She’s well protected
German Shepherds are one of my favorite breeds! They highly intelligent and can reason for themselves and they look so Wolfie! Awesome video’s! Thanks for the upload!
Now that&#39;s what HEAVEN looks like, she so lucky
Собачий рай!
The best thing I&#39;ve seen ever thank you
🥰❤️🥰
Oh German shepherd DOGS.
Best breed hands down!
This is too cute! I dont know who is having more fun, the little girl giggling as she throws grass or the pack who jump for joy when they try to catch the grass. Such a darling video! So adorable!
The best protection right there
How delightful ❤️. I live in a place where human adults get scared even if a dog wags his tail and they teach their kids to be afraid as well in turn end up hating the lovely  Doggles
Wonder and beautiful 😍
This is like something straight out of heaven. Just so much purity and love
🥰
And to act like nothing could go wrong is assanine. Maniacle
Innocent, unadulterated freedom. Enjoy it while it lasts.
This is where i pray to end up every sunday
Picture me rolling in school with 14 Bodyguards <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23savage">#savage</a>
That thing written 6 years ago? Agree. Shepard of German Shepards.
So Smart Girl!
If the requirement to enter heaven was being surrounded by a bunch of german shepherds while you are there, i would be fine with that.
Innocence beautiful
stupid behavior.... but what shall I say?.... she is just 5
Im fed up with those endless &quot;safe girl&quot; comments. time to leave comment section.
remember what they took from you.
I want her life
She’s the most safest person on the planet no worries
She&#39;s untouchable
one of the best videos ive ever seen.  looks like it came right out of a movie.  beautiful and pure.
Safest Kid Ever. Even a BEAR would think twice.
That’s probably the most well protected little girl on the planet.
I&#39;m not religious but if there&#39;s a heaven this is probably what it looks like.
That&#39;s one safe,protected little girl. Unless a hungry grizzly or bigfoot is nearby, those dogs got her back
Most  dogs are better than most people
In 13 years, she will be playing heavily, with 14 or more African or Jamaican “shepherds”
Nothing in the world better than this video right here. Time to replay.
I always have odd thoughts like this. If this girl and her dogs could go back in a time machine about 6 or 7 thousand years, our current religions would be based on her.
Only 1 out of 14 German Shepherds survived the exhaustion.
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Love it ... We probably would have been all better off we were raised by German shepherds, I know I would have, the shepherds probably think that she&#39;s an alpha male
So this is how u get 10mil views
&quot;German Shepards are dangerous to kids&quot; <br>Huh? ,...where was this information give to you?
Beautiful
Just glad the title is not &quot;14 German Shepherds Plays With Little Girl&quot;
Safest kid on the planet
She&#39;s Queen of the FAFO Club...
that little girl&#39;s protected better than the president right now
Why ?! That scares me . When dogs are in a pack they can suddenly turn against you .
This is the best representation of protective condoms
Nice moment !
Lunch!
She has the best protectors around
Girl: throwing gras and stuff in the air<br>Pooches: &quot;Bite that down, bite that down!&quot;
Is this heaven?
Felicidad😊
I have Anatolian Shepherds and Jack Russells… Heavenly!!!
She is the alpha
All fun and games until bolto runs back into the house with a bone wrapped in pink... not a bright idea.
Reminds me of Me
what a buzz for that girl
SHE IS THE MOST PROTECTED GIRL IN THE PLANET 🌎 AT THAT MOMENT!
So this is what it looks like when you decide to keep the litter
It was beautiful example of childhood innocence.. This kind<br> of scene can only be scripted<br> in most instances.,.My compliments. You seemed to<br> capture the moment.. However,<br> next time try getting a bit closer.<br> A Medium Long Shot would be<br> more effective...     B.Buccina
Girls doesn&#39;t realize she&#39;s at the happiest she will ever be in her life. The older she gets the more she will wish she could go back to these days
Remember what they took from you, return to tradition
Beautiful!! Awwww 🥰
she has a straight up wolf pack
14 best friends she has🙃💚😏
She’s the head of the pack.
German shepherds are fiercely loyal and protective of children. No one better mess with that girl. My cousin was a K9 officer. His shepherd would take down the toughest criminal. But when he got home, it was play time. He loved his girls and no one better mess with them.
Since the video had been uploaded 9 years ago, she must be 14 years now. And she must have a bunch of great old memories with these 14 GSD
Lucky child!
Safest girl in the world
Che meraviglia 😘
if there was just more of this there would be world peace
👍👌👏 All having a lot of fun (except the flowers). 😁😁
stupid parent
Safest little girl in the world 🇬🇧✌️😂
I pity the poor fool that tries to kidnap that little girl.
If you’ve ever wondered who the “safest person in the world” is, at the moment it’s that little girl.🤩
At that moment: Safest human on planet Earth‼️
this girl has some serious back up i had a shepard when young these dogs protect
She&#39;s keeping them entertained, too!
That girls safer then the president..
patrolling duties during the week, fun times with family on the weekends
I witnessed a child playing with his families four Rottweilers, all were well trained obedient dogs but on this day for some unknown reason one of the dogs decided to attack the child. Unfortunately the thee other dogs joined in attacking the boy.<br>All four dogs were destroyed the same day, no second chances.
Thanks for posting this. It makes me smile.
Adorable. But I guess after paying for all the dog food you can&#39;t afford a couple balls to play with????
safest little girl in the woods.  isnt a bear out there that would touch her for $1,000,000
That&#39;s probably the safest kid in the world!
Pretty cool …
They are so cute and you know well protected she is right now 😊
What fun.
She will soon be the leader of the pack.
Not something you see everyday.
At the end of this sequence, the German Shepherds eat the child !
Wolf princess
I&#39;m really jealous haha
Best dogs ever..
Over here, the farmer would have turned up on a quad bike and told her that she and the dogs needed to stick to the public footpath and threatened legal action if she didn&#39;t.
Oh ya it’s all fun and games till the dogs get hungry
Charm.
You Just dont whant to go there , it&#39;s a relax Moment
GSDs are so smart, and want to please with all their hearts, they jumped high into the air in case she was trying to signal them to do that by throwing the grass. 💖
I love my female German Shepherd Nova....she is the best.
It&#39;s as if the grass were gold coins, oh to be young, happy and free!
СКОЛЬКО   САБАК   УЖАС   КАКОЙТО     ВСЕ  ОВЧАРКИ
How could this clip get 14 608 333 views?
Heaven
I wish that this was all that life was. Entire existence is just childhood in a field with a pack of dogs. Sounds awesome.
She is more guarded than the president.
So much serotonin 🥺❤️❤️
Господи,как я завидую этому ребенку,для меня это картинка из райской жизни.
i had 8 dogs when i was a kid, i would throw there favorite ball in the air catch it and run 🏃‍♂️ it was a frightening experience.
Cool, but why so many? Ha. 😄
Youtube: Hey! You wanna see a little girl in a field of flowers playing with 14 German Shepherds?<br><br>Me: Well, I dont really....<br><br>Youtube: You want to see a little girl in a field of flowers playing with 14 German Shepherds.<br><br>Me: I wanna see a little girl in a field of flowers playing with 14 German Shepherds.
Z+ security
That’s the beauty of innocence the girl and the dogs just want to play. My Malinois will play with anything, love love love
😍
Heavenly ❤️
Safest child in the world.
Secret service vibes
A long life memory for this young woman
A glimpse of heaven.
The safest girl on the planet.  LOL
Immer wieder schön wie der Mensch mit den Tieren eine Partnerschaft eingehen kann, ohne Misstrauen.
imagine someone approaching her with ill intent, i already feel bad for the poor bastardo
Delightful!! Thanks!
If anyone tried to snatch that kid right then, they&#39;d have to ID the perp from piles of dog crap.
👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍😂😂😂😂
Please post more videos of these beautiful dogs….
And climate change isnt real because of a snowball
She could officially become lunch for the pack.  Parents aren&#39;t the sharpest knives in the drawer.
Watching this and humming “heaven must be like this…”
How on Earth do you keep all of them occupied?
The one filming her is seen by the dogs as pack leader.  If the girl is alone with them, no telling what could happen.
Is she still alive in 2022 ?
I can not effort to buy even a singl dog.
Ghislane has no chance in recruiting this one as a &quot;model&quot;.
❤️❤️❤️‼️®™️☑️☑️
This is  how we were before. Absolutely heavenly.
GERMAN SHEPHERDS, safest DOG , any day, any time, REPEAT MOST INTELLIGENT, PROTECTIVE, and  safe.<br>Other breeds need to come with clean criminal RECORDS to prove.<br>RAFI Maine USA
German Shepards are the best breed with Doberman Pinschers a close second....
Niet echt bij zichzelf.
9yrs ago... Update? Hope the now teenager (?) GS&#39;s are still alive &amp; well.
My favorite part is where the dog starts running :)
Good lord.  Imagine if she had a tennis ball.
Animal pack and killer instinct in dogs. 1.4 million people in the States were involved in dog attack  incidents annually and 800k needed medical attention,  involving 14 fatalities.
Beautiful 💯🐕🐶
I dare anyone to talk loud approaching lil&#39; miss!!!<br>It isn&#39;t going to happen. She&#39;s as safe as if she&#39;d be in heaven. <br>Trust and believe.
Wow they are so well behaved around her!
If anybody try &amp; harm her, they will be consumed. lol
That is great to see . Today is july 8 2022. Greetings from Belgium.
They will never attack her
Adorable.
That child knows no fear. :)))
The girl was never found again
❤
Big deal, not video worthy per se
Ain&#39;t nothing happening to that kid!
Life is beautiful ❤️
Anyone with a GS has good stories to tell.
que hermoso
Welcome to the safest place on Earth 🌎
So many Germans...
How many stories have we read about children being mauled and killed by dogs who the owners thought were friendly?  Shame on her parents putting her in such danger.
Haha lol
Spelled little wrong in the title lol
That is one lucky girls. Heaven forbid if anyone they don&#39;t know comes into the picture!
It shows you don&#39;t have to die to go to heaven.
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
You never play with an animal, it plays with you….!
That’s a super pack ..a pack of wolves but well fed and well trained ..
I&#39;m not to sure I would let my child be around that many animals it seems to me it would take just one of them to set them all off 🤔then who&#39;s gonna stop them from hurting her
14 thats a dozen to attack any aggressor and 2 more to still stand guard lol
Is she still the boss and are they all still alive
which one is Jacob?
Is it fucked up I kinda want to see some one try to harm her while all those dogs are around
Желающиемпоиграть предлагают свои игрушки - палочки.
Their all having the best fun! 👱‍♀️🐾💖🐕
Small children should always be monitored when around dogs. These dogs may all know this child, but still, an adult is hopefully supervising.
That&#39;s a REALLY nice field.  Lots of room to play in.
German shepherds one of the most intelligent and obedient dogs, extremely loyal and have great intuition towards good people and great intuition towards bad people
No child should be left alone with so many dogs. I don&#39;t care how &#39;friendly&#39; those dogs seem. It&#39;s irresponsible in the extreme. And all this to garner views. No child should be left alone with any dog, never mind a group of them.
If this is not how heaven looks like i don&#39;t wanna go.🤷
Cette petite choupette est merveilleuse 😊 et les chiens sont vraiment les meilleurs amis de l’Homme.
Это самое милое видео на ютубе<br>Дружелюбные немецкие овчарки играют с маленькой девочкой
Extraordinarily dangerous. If one dog bit her, the rest would tear her to shreds before an adult could get to her. Packs of dogs are highly unpredictable.
I would hate to be the big bad wolf coming to eat that little red riding hood
If Hitler had kids ha
That reminds me the story Beauty and the beast
Best YouTube video I&#39;ve ever seen.
Beautiful place.
Beautiful and heartwarming.  But thinking about dog years and the post date, I hope they are still happy and healthy.<br><br>Bless them all.<br><br>Skoal<br>JF
Lovely, lovely...
Safest kid in the world!
Ok, I seriously need to make it my main goal to be this care free for the rest of my life.
This is beautiful. Like a pack of wolfs protecting
Even The Bigfoot or Slender man will not even have the Balls to come near that Girl...
Looks like some pretty country. And bear country.
This is unshepherd of
1st time in my life I envy someone!
Dogs are so much smarter than people! So so true!
I pity any methhead mongoloid who is dumb enough to lay a hand on that young&#39;un! They would have to DNA the dog&#39;s poop to identify the loser! German Shepherd is a VERY protective breed; especially with children!
Talk about safe in your space…wow
The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice&#39; den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. Isaiah 11:6-9
Beautiful picture 👍👍
Take your shoes off before you come in the house dear!! Remember we have 14 German Shepherds
If she were to start running in one direction the dogs would form up in a cute escort.
Que hermosa vida...
ALSATIONS
God help anyone or anything with bad intent for that little girl.
Спасибо !!!
Shes a German Shepard whisperer...the German girl..
The two things I love the most and prefer to be around more than anyone or anything else.... CHILDREN AND ANIMALS! They have no falseness in them and they give love unconditionally... I really cant stand being around so-called adults I wish I could live like this little girl and these dogs, in a field where we could run and laugh and play without fear of a sick society buggering it up. <br><br>That is a heartwarming short video!!!
Don&#39;t know if they have her as their actual pack leader, but looks like they love her energy, and some even leap for her tossed flowers.
Feel sorry for tha idiot who tries to steal that little girl. Lol
She needs to have a ball or several balls to throw so she can play &quot;fetch&quot; with them. Why her parents didn&#39;t provide her with one is puzzling.
It is clear, that these dogs are good familiar with this little child, otherwise thex wouldnt all are ready to play with her.
Exceedingly dangerous to leave a child with these dogs. They are very dangerous to children. They are so dangerous that in some countries, you are not eligible for health insurance if you keep German Shepherds
вот это волчары
Qué imágenes más preciosas 😍😍😍
Amazing روعة
She&#39;s the Pack Leader👱‍♀️👌
That is PARADISE 🌈
heaven looks like this
Makes me want to buy 15 German Shepherds for my little girl!  O_o
If she knows all the dog commandos, she IS not only the best protected girl, she is also somebody to be afraid of if she had a bad day, trust me this pack will be deadly if the the right commandos are addressed, I am German, greetings from Berlin Germany 🇩🇪
Most of those dogs are excellent quality specimens.
Would never let my children play with a pack of mutts like that.
This is why I want my own rescue shelter. For this happiness every day.
The video is more German than the German itself nowdays
No one is going to hurt that little girl, happy!
Eh, she&#39;s part of the pack, a member of the family and nothing will get anywhere near her.  Anyone that thinks she&#39;s in danger, go try save her.  She&#39;s safer than a full grown man with a gun.
&quot; That&#39;s Adorable 💯 👌 ❤ &quot;...
The safest kid out there
Beautiful black saddles! They are all so well socialized and they adore having the fair haired maiden throwing sticks up into the air and letting out that joyous squeal of DELIGHT! Truly a Hallmark moment!<br>✝️🙏🏼💫❤⚘😘<br>🐶👱‍♀️🐶👱‍♀️🐶👱‍♀️🐶👱‍♀️🐶👱‍♀️
YEEEESSS<br>THIS IS ALL FROLICKY AND WUNDABA UUUUUNTIL <br>IT S TIME TO CLEAN UP ALL THE <br>SHHHHIIIEEEET
Puppypalooza!
The safest little girl in the world
Full protection 🙏 😌
That&#39;s is a lot of dog shite to deal with let alone food..unless they eat raw chicken they raise
It’s a real dog 😍😍😍😍
Very safe little girl.
Thank you Truely cute..now if life could be so Free 💜❤️💜
Wait for Me..play sweet angel plus fur babies.
I would feel very worried if this was My daughter.???
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😃
She is the leader of the pack now.
Wonderful video
That’s one little girl who won’t be messed with at the bus stop.
Innocent,unaware  girl.
now, imagine her around a pack of shitbulls
I might actually pity the fool that trys to attack the little girl, (might).  Those dogs would literally tear them apart!
I imagine Heaven looks a lot like this
:)))
Lets pause and appreciate how this video quality ages like fine wine 🍷 9yrs ago when it was uploaded
Is that a ferral child raised by wolves?
How come there are so many GS, is she lives in dog breeding farm ?
Großartig!!!
Wir hatten 10 Bordercollies und ein 2 jähriges Mädchen mittendrin. Die haben sogar den Schnuller geteilt
Сколько овчарок,супер видео👍👍👍👍👍👍
This has to be one of the cutest videos ever
14, Damn, Ya&#39;ll had puppies and couldn&#39;t bring yourselves to put them up for adoption? Cool!
Obviously, she&#39;s the pack leader.
If that isn&#39;t the cutest thing I don&#39;t know what is! ❤️🐾🐕👍 That&#39;s my idea of heaven!❤️🐾🐕👏
The only other person stronger than her is someone with 15 German Shepards.
Imagine someone trying to grab that little girl.they would die a very painful death.
Amo demais eu tinha uma faz 3 dias que ela morreu  😭😭
And if she where in Germany, she would be a German, German, German Shepard……..👍😉
Great to watch, great dogs….but in a way, a pack that could not be stopped if one snapped !  Sorry, but not my granddaughters, even if my dogs, and I love dogs.
Great video.  Thanks for posting.
This little girl has 14 big fur brothers and sisters to play with.  Good times!  The security enforcement detail is a nice bonus.
<a href="http://cool.now/">Cool.Now</a> try doing this with pit bulls.
Bring a smile to my face 🙂
Love this video
快樂的童年-<del>羨慕-</del>
thank you for making this video
Beata lei!♥️♥️♥️♥️
Lucky little girl ❤🐾💕
14 exuberant puppers and not one tries to knock her over or jump up on her.  Genius.
Might be the safest little girl in the world...if mom &amp; dad have guns to back-up all those teeth. As much as I love my GSDs, there&#39;s always some evil human with a gun to contend with.
Guys what will happen if someone tries to rob his house at night without knowing all these dogs are free roaming.<br><br>What will happen
Now if somebody attacks her what will happen to the attacker.?????
The German Sheppards and their pet human girl.
If they are her parent&#39;s dogs and they were raised properly, she is PERFECTLY safe!  The problems always arise from unfamiliar dogs and/or poorly trained ones.
Beautiful. If that was 14 shitbulls, the kid would have been mauled within 10 seconds
Most protected child on earth try getting near her agressevly
Dog whisperer
Tips &amp; Tricks: German Shepherds Protect Her Baby
I hope she knows she&#39;s untouchable..
Heaven,pure heaven.
HEAVEN ON EARTH!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️this is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She is so protected.  No one would dare try anything with her.  Dog chow time.
The parents of this child should be locked up for child neglect.
Hey you canine fools. Two more children mauled and maimed for life by dogs today in the UK .<br>The maimed bit is IF they survive.<br>And you clowns still think it&#39;s Soo cute to have dogs and small children mixing in close quarters. 😢😢
And another child mauled to death yesterday..... But but dogs are so safe 😡😡😡😡
Yuwhoo
I love it
1 hour version pls
There just the german shepherd dogs you wanna see the rottys and cats she&#39;s got
Real life disney princess
Imagine a pack wolves just came out of the woods and start a war
This video is beautiful 💕🇦🇺☕️
The best YouTube video ever.
Fully secured girl
She’s gonna be a dark souls boss when she gets older
Prince Andrew&#39;s greatest disappointment!
German Shepherds are gentle with children and very protective ❤️.  If my girl hears a little person crying when we&#39;re walking in a shopping center or some other busy public space, she comes to an abrupt halt, looks around, and won&#39;t move until she spots the unhappy one.  We stand there as long as she needs to -- when she&#39;s ready, we move on.
When you find out you’re having a girl:
When my daughter tells me a guy was following her on the way home from school:
the first thing you see when you join ur bestie&#39;s Minecraft server
There is no beast invented by god  to touch this angel.dogs are incredibly alert. Just watch them
are the small ones from the same litter
I cannot imagine 14 Rottweilers surrounding the girl. That would have been a different video all together
Just curious is this a German shepherd farm ?

Just Beautiful 😀
Oww amazing pure German shepherds with amazing back coat nice body shape <br>And very happy to be around playing with the little princess 😊
I dare any wolf to come near her!!
um wtf is disney land.....LMFAO
I have had several german Shepards, all of them great dogs, smart and very protective to the kids. <br>I can,t have any now, but i would like to have one, they are the men&#39;s best friend.
Hey is that.. a heaven on earth?
The BEST breed, once you have one, you will never have another breed - or you will have at least one shepherd. Had 2 before, have 2 now, they are my heart. 💖  That&#39;s a lucky girl. That&#39;s my idea of heaven.
Wonder how she feels about this now she&#39;s 13
So when can I meet your dad when you get past my 14 bros.
the safest little girl in the world.
When I read the title I was like.... What? I clicked and sure enough... Holy cow imagine if they where grate Danes
When the dad doesn&#39;t want his daughter to date until he thinks she&#39;s ready 😅

The 15th dog is the fiercest of them all- Chihuahua
GSD make great family pets, all-rounder dogs for so any training service tasks too.
A man broke into a house one night, his goal was to take something small and valuable. While he was searching through the stuff he heard a small voice &quot;Jesus is watching you.&quot; He stopped for a moment and said to himself &quot;This must be a voice from my old sunday school.&quot; So he continued searching, about 5 minutes later he heard the voice again &quot;Jesus is watching you.&quot; He turned his flashlight to the direction and he saw a parrot. He said to the parrot &quot;What is your name?&quot; The parrot replied &quot;Moses&quot; The robber then said &quot;What kind of silly people would name there parrot Moses?&quot; The parrot looked up and said &quot;The same people who named the German shepherd jesus!&quot;
She’s just flipping out it’s ok leave her alone, get back, get back….
