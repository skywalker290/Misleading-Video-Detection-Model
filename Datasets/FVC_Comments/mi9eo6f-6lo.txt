Buggy wuggy
i know an exterminator thats perfect for this type of spider. his name starts with a g, and ends with an odzilla
i remember when i was little i watched this and thought it was real so for 7 years of my life i thought there was giant spider men roaming the earth
It&#39;s fake
Is alien only exist in Russia like WHAT THE <b>**</b>
These comments will kill me before the spider XDDD<br>((Is it really a spider tho..? He only has 4 legs...
okay<br><br><br><br><br>who let their dog outside

Oh that? That&#39;s just Matarael.
fake a spider has 8 legs this is just Ivans pet
Check out billschannel. It&#39;s debunked as fake
Wow! It looks... <br>So........<br><br>REAL!
Watch this video on mute, and at the same time play the Spiderman theme song
Lol people keep saying it&#39;s fake but let&#39;s look at the stuff we know about this black spider creature:<br>1. There&#39;s multiple pieces of footage with this thing. Not necessarily 100% proof of it&#39;s existence, but I&#39;m just throwing it out there. <br>2. I see people&#39;re claiming that since all the sightings are only in Russia, it&#39;s fake. Wrong. If anything, it only raises the validity of the sightings. Are you gonna see this thing if it lives exclusively in Russia? NO. Unless you live there of course. <br>3. There&#39;s more high quality footage of this thing than this YouTube video. As a matter of fact, this video itself is just lowered in quality. Just raw footage.
I want one of these as a pet. Do you know how cool it would be to have one of these as a pet and ride its back while it climbs walls? That would be AWESOME!
not sure if its fake or not but still looks freaky.
seems to be missing four of its legs, and realism.
4-5 of the frames were completely still and no human could hold a camera that well so that was two vids and also CrystalTheMinecraft GamerGirl is correct. 100,000,000% FAKE

its fake.
this looks like cloverfield monster.Â  does anyone know where this was. evidence may be in the building faÃ§ade.
FAKEEEEE
It&#39;s not real... And if it would be real,let&#39;s think for a minute, the apartament window&#39;s size is like 1-2 meters long. The spider was like 2-3 times of a window size.That means it&#39;s body is like 6-8 meters long. It has 4 giant legs to move. Moving his legs he uses tons of energy. To get that energy for climbing he has to eat more than a African Elephant. His stomach has to be like 2 meters wide and 2 meters long. To fill his stomach, he needs more than 100 litres of water and food. Where da fuk he will get that much food and water?
Was this shot underwater or something? What on earth is causing the color and distortions?! Get out of your apartment, it&#39;s flooding!
If it was real,guys from the apartments would see the creature,and they would call the police.
Do not believe this shit for anything! If you look you can see the camera stays still for 3 full frames! It was animated! Nobody I know can hold a phone perfectly still for 3 seconds so how the fuck is he doing it? See what I mean?! FAKE!!!!
Fake

Ya, I was in one of those apartments but apparently I wasn&#39;t screaming or running away cause I was too MLG.
that is some good editing
This is fake because the camera isn&#39;t moving and the creature is pixelating a little
I went on google for help with homework... How did I get to watching this???
They forgot to edit people running out the building and screaming
So real

People are saying its fake. Good job kiddies you spotted the obvious. But take it with a pinch of salt there always that one chance that it&#39;s real
