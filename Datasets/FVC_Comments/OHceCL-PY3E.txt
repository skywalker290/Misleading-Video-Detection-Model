Also if you are just sitting there not paying attention then suddenly see a snake coming you don&#39;t always watch how they are moving you see snake and think oh shit run or grab. As soon as she grabbed it you can tell she realized it was fake
If you guys took time out of your day to look it up they pranked her but she didn&#39;t know. Her brother and sister were hoping she&#39;d run but where they live they used to catch snakes all the time. Yes he was pranking her but she didn&#39;t know it and she grabbed it right up thinking it was real
The cobra looking dead
Good try I see someone you sing a fishing Rod and cobras can’t move straight good try
Cobra looks fake
Everyone is saying that it’s fake but I’m thinking of what happened after she threw Cobra
The people who thought this was real has no brain <br><br>1. Snakes dont slither in straight lines<br><br>2. Theres a shadow of a man with a fishing rod<br><br>3. Snakes dont frickin flop on the ground and bounce like wth
FAKE FAKE FAKE
A cobra NEVER moves in a straight line, they always move like some kind of worm lol and you can clearly see the man holding a fishing rod
It&#39;s FAKE THE SHADOW WAS SO OBVIOUS
Be honest you didn’t find that it is fake you watched inside edition!
U see the shadow and they never go in straight lines
Its easy to see that its fake somehow<br>The other people think, oh wow she brave, well they didnt see the thing over there, if you dumb well Ok...

There’s a shadow of a man holding a fishing pole. And plus cobras aren’t that color. She is in Africa I can tell and cobras are in India. And cobras don’t move in a strait line. And when she threw that cobra the cobra tumbled on its back and didn’t move
FAKE

When she threw it, it was not moving its like DEAD<br><br>6.they don&#39;t keep their  head up when there about to attack<br><br>7. And she looked back so mabye she saw the rod<br><br>Damn 7 y&#39;all bad at faking stuff

U guys need a different angle
Ya this is so real you TOTALLY can&#39;t see the fishing rod
It’s fake as hell, for sure if it was a real cobra she won’t be able to catch it.
That is fake because I saw a shadow of a guy reeling in a fishing rod
Look in the shadow on the right bottom and there’s proof because inside edition made a video about this which is FAKE. Thanks for reading
this is fake in the right corner you can see someone using a fishing rod to bring it in AND a cobra doesnt move in a straight line it moves in a s form
Wow did people actually believe this?
Fake
Fake
You can see the reel in the background, and snakes don’t move in a straight line, they curve in a figure eight shape. This is faker then Kim Kardashian’s ass.
What language are they speaking?
There’s a fishing rod as you can see in the shadow
1. Someone behind her is holding a fishing rod 2. Science has never found a cobra close to its colors 3. A cobra doesn’t go straight it’s moves in a S path 5. A snake wouldn’t flop around when it dead like that or after it’s thrown it will still be able to slither around/ to you 6. This is just a hoax
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHceCL-PY3E&amp;t=2">0:02</a> look at that shadow of a fishing rod, hmm......
Yu not good
Cobras move like an S shape not strait and who is that shadow of a guy looks like he have a fishing rod this is fake watch Inside Edition WTF

Fake
You can see the dude is using a fishing rod to pull in the snake
WOW THIS SO FAKE!!
So fake even faker than ben franklin as president
This is fake
FAKEFAKE!<br>Watch Inside edition sweetheart.
Guys everyone knows it’s fake but it’s still cool to look at. The snakes pattern isn’t like a cobras (underneath pattern.) There is a shadow and it shows you the fishing rod. When she tosses the “snake” on the ground it doesn’t move and it just flops onto the ground like dead weight. Also the way it’s moving isn’t a way a King Cobra would move. As you can tell even a little kid can tell the difference. But it’s meant for enjoyment, so, ENJOY it! 😁
You can tell it&#39;s fake because if you look at the shadow it shows the man with a fishing hook
I don’t understand why people hate on this video so much. It’s an obvious prank they tried to pull on the young woman and they’re not trying to fool viewers into thinking it was a live cobra attacking. I think the video is amusing and lighthearted. I don’t understand what the male voice says but it obviously sounds like he’s having fun. Thank you for sharing this video.
Fake!
how can anyone think this is real
That is so fake
Idk y everyone is saying its fake, when the lady grabbed the snake, she killed it by snapping its neck. So when she threw it it landed like that. and the dude with the fishing rod was legit just fishing with a long ass wire. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ so yall r dumb...
Yes , this is fake , but it is actually a prank for the girl..
Fake
FAKE BECAUSE THE SHADOW SHOWS ARMS WITH FISHER ROD
How on earth do u think no one is going to realise the shadow of someone pull the &quot;cobra&quot; by a fishing rod

Bottom right corner fishing rod
<b>Look at the bottom of the screen at the beginning. You can see someone reeling something in, the ‘snake’. That’s how we know it’s fake.</b>

Its fake. Look at the shadow on the bottom. FISHING POLE
Look at the shadow!!
My own personal snake is trying to get to her.
Mood tbh
There a guy with a fishing hook in the shadow, those type of snakes are now capable of that speed, there nowhere near close to that color, and you threw it like it was dead

You could see in the shadow a guy behind her using your fishingrod to reel in the snake. It also looks dead and makes the farm and goes on its back when she throws it. Call brothers don’t go straight. They make an “S” formation. They also can’t go that fast.
Fake
It couldn’t be more obvious that its fake like clearly you can see the shadow of a man using an fishing line attached to “the snake”
cobra moves in a S shape  idiot and u can see the fishing rod shadow
Fake. You can see someone’s shadow pulling a fishing rod.

Stuper fake
Fake you can tell their is a wire attached  to the snake and the guy rearing it in and a cobra does not move in a straight line it moves in a s figure and their is no cobra that similar color
Fake as fuck
Fishing rod there and a snake can&#39;t just fall on it&#39;s back and stand still
The snake was fake but she was real... I guess.
Arriba la miss de inglés

U can see the fishing rod
It all makes sense, there is a shadow of a man that is reeling in the fake snake with the fishing rod
Cobra never moved in a straight line
fake
This is so fake that watched this vid like 2 years ago like😂😂😂
i see a person with a fishing rod put your speed a slow 5 and look at the lower right!!
Fake AF as Inside Edition says you can see a guy pulling the &quot;Snake&quot; in on a fishing 🎣 hook
So fake it&#39;s laughable, since when did snakes move in a straight line?
fake or not, you can bet your butt that i&#39;m still terrified of snakes 😂
FAKE!  Cobras move in an &quot;s&quot; shape and no snake is that color. There is a shadow of a man reeling something in. And, when she throws the snake back, it looks dead. Snakes don&#39;t die from things like that<br>THIS VIDEO IS FAKER THAN NIKI MINAJ&#39;S BUTT
Fake
Two brothers were trying to scare their sister but it failed. They all used to catch snakes at that river when they were kids so she was used to them. The story&#39;s on the Daily Mirror. Funny as hell, tho.
its fake you can see the shadow with a fishing rod pulling the fake cobra
Video so fake CNN just contacted the uploader so they can feature it on headline news
Fake there is a fishing rod I. The boot right and he&#39;s using it for the snake
Really bitch?
that is fake you can see a shadow rolling. the snake the cam cought it
This is FAKE
Fake so fake
hi
Oh sheesh, so fake.  Fooled me the first time I saw it, though.
Look at the shadow. It looks like a guy is reeling in the snake with a fishing rod. Doesn&#39;t it? I&#39;m not saying this video is fake but it seems suspicious.
Theres a guy with a fishing rod attached to the snake.... and snakes dont go in a straight line!.... And The snake looked like it was dead!!  Its Fake!! EXPOSED
There&#39;s a guy pulling a fake snake with a fishing pole and also king cobras don&#39;t move on a straight line
Fake they were moving it with the fishing rod 🎣
uber fake
fake than wwe
So Fake It&#39;s funny
Fake
You can see the fishing rod in the shadow honey😊😉
ahhahahahhahaa
1. Dogs reactions and the other people reactions <br>2. Coloration of the Cobra<br>3. You can see the shadow to the fishing rod<br>4. Cobras can&#39;t move that fast and can&#39;t move in a straight line
fake af
You can thank Michael Jones from Achievement Hunter for showing me this short video.
There is a fishing rod reeling in the snake and cobras don&#39;t have the abilitie to go straight so it is claimed to be FALSE 🐍👈❌
Dis fake ou jy kan sien een van die manne daar agter het n vistok en daai slang lyk dood so dit is nie eers waar nie en n slang gaan nie net reguit nie dit maak n soorte  S terwyl hy syl so hierdie video is nie waar nie mense sou dit glo as dieman agter se skaduwee nie daar was nie.
You see the person holding a fishing rod lmao..
Anyone else see a fishing pole
Fake. I saw a man using a reel. Also, it looked dead after throw.
What they didnt show was the snake coming to her house that night with a silenced pistol
Meh it was funnier when Geoff watched it.
I heard about this, but after seeing it, it&#39;s so clearly a fake snake.
I saw this on Achievement Hunter. It&#39;s a shame that it&#39;s fake.
Oh, it&#39;s fake. I thought for half a sec it was real.
Achievement Hunter sent me here
Came here from an Achievement Hunter video
Fake or not, Geoff Ramsey shit his pants at this
Does anyone NOT see the shadow of the guy reeling this thing in?
at least hide the fishing rod so that we cant see it because we saw the shadows
fake!!!!!!!!!!
cobras don&#39;t open their hood while slithering. They only open their hood after they rear up to strike.
FAKE
who else is from bills channel
What a crazy place to live! :-)
Why are all these comments arguing that it&#39;s fake? Did you think for a second it was real?
The snake is moving in a straight line😒
super fake.  real snakes do not move like that to begin with.  the dogs not getting excited give clue that they are used to this fake snake.  also snakes do not attack just like that unless they feel theathened.
Fake af
fake stop doing this u can see ur shadow holding a fishing rod if ur going to do this again u need a better plan don&#39;t u
he used a fishing rod and reeled in a toy snake fakeeee
this video is fake because u can see a man&#39;s shadow on the bottom right corner with a fishing rod wheeling in the cobra
fake cuz that was not a slither that went in a straight line
this is fake if you look at the bottom right corner a guy uses a fishing rod to reel in the fake snake you can see the shadow of the line and the rod
This video is fake as fucking shit.
This is so fake look at the shadow at the bottom right corner he has a rod that is obviously tied to the &#39;snake&#39;
your using a fishing rod so fake!!!!!!!
You where fishing it out this video is lame😒
FAKE !
so fake
First of all that snake 🐍 was going 20 miles per hour on grass plus the shadow shows the<br>Man reeling in the snake and its true and the dog 🐶 would of freaked out from the umm &quot;snake&quot; plus <br>It has a rubber texture
1. Fishing rod being reeled in, in the bottom right shadow<br>2. Cobras never move in a straight line <br>3. Cobras can go that fast<br> I got those all from a video I&#39;m not smart
fake
thus is fake  no way someone can do that
SO FAKKKKKKKE
so fak it funny
THIS IS SO FAKE 👎💩😣
I wonder what happened after
lol i just came here to say its fake! cobra&#39;s dont charge like that hood out like this toy
Man if your trying to fool someone at least get your shadow out of the video and don&#39;t make the snake THAT fast
SO FAKE ITS FUNNY SO SOSO FAKE!

Fake
Fake
obviously it&#39;s fake omg that&#39;s not the point. her friends were trying to scare her with a toy snake / fishing rod thing and the way she reacted was not what they were expecting lol, if most people saw a cobra barreling towards them they&#39;d just scream and flail like an octopus.
1: Cobras slither in a zig zag motion, in the video it wasn&#39;t<br>2: there are no cobra species with that color in the video<br>3: when the girl catches the cobra and throws it, it looked dead like a toy<br>4: in the bottom right corner there&#39;s a shadow of a fishing pole<br>5:SO FAKE IT&#39;S FUNNY!!!
At first i thought it was real, then i saw a fishing rod and the snake sounds wooden.
Oh yea! It is fake.
The guy has a fishing pole it&#39;s fake
i see a man reeling a fishing rod
It is not a real snake. It is a fake snake and we can see that it is attached to a fishing line. It is being reeled in by the one with the fishing rod whose shadow we can see on the right bottom of the screen.
Unepic! I don&#39;t even know this, but.. that snack looks so............. :(
FAKE
kek
you can see he has a fishing pole in the shadow

Fake
Fake
Who thinks this is real? Look at the silhouette of the man. He is holding an object that looks similar to a fishing rod. He connected a string to the snake and pulled it along the grass. The first thing I noticed is the way the snake behaved. Why would a snake become hostile when the people have not harmed it. A snake would never do that.
Its fake
Brave
NOP
This is fake 💋

Guys it&#39;s real..he was fishing and the snake happened to come at the same time. Plus when she grabs it look how it doesn&#39;t even move like most snakes would. She is a legend, she controlled the snake. Seriously i mean it&#39;s totally real guys. Legend says that one day a woman will be sent to earth to prove that we shall not fear the cobra. She fought the evil with her hands and threw it away to demonstrate the south african &quot;gulu man hunu el chapo guzman polo gotto&quot; method of controlling the evil. Also, yes i&#39;m a troll and if you actually read through all of this bull and believed it...You deserve a medal son! Have a great 2018 €verybody and remeber to stay unhealthy.

Yeah, the girl totally did not see him with the fishing rod at the start, and she totally wasn&#39;t &quot;in&quot; on the whole thing given her whole bodylanguage during the vid, not to mention absolutely zero reaction to noticing the cobra racing toward her. A premeditated stunt.
You can see the guy with a fishing rod and the cobra fake
Wow
strong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
so fail
LENA HÄR KOMMER SLANG, SLALOM
She says like:<br>There you go bitch!
what are is this so i know i have to stay away from it?
Hahah so fukin fake..<br>just look at her boyfriends shadow with the casting rod.. xD
Fake
you can even see the fishingrod they are using to make it move, you see the shadow at the botom of the video
โหดว่ะ
Hahaha...ay wonder how many people got fooled by this xD
when looking at the movement of the snakes body one can clearly see that the snake is in fact face and us pulled by something. A real snake propelles itself forward with sideways movements which the snake in the video clearly doesn&#39;t. Nevere the less a good video with a great reaction from the girl. Nice orang mate.
fake bullshit.
Fake snake
Fake! À Guy is holding à fishingrood that u Can see in the Grass!
