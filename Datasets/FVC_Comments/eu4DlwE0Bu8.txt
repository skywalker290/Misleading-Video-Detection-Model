Tragic way to be dying in vain if such.<br>Young ppl celebrating; drinking, partying, wmn with sk*mpy clothes etc..<br>Enjoying life too much that they forgot abt death that can come anytime &amp; anywhere..<br>Sad but trueâ€¦.
So does the person over this get blamed too like Travis ?
Yâ€™all had one good thing and fucked it up.
Lol dumbfucks
Lmao wtf these people got going on. Talk about a stampede of morons on drugs.<br>Edit: watch the video all the way through. It gets better by the second
Pathetic
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=35">0:35</a> the sucuriy guard getting eaten by zombies
This is the saddest and most funniest
man im just looking for sound effects wtf is this
they are escaping because that music is puke
but. what hapened there to panic?
Exit only more like only exit
Send in the nukes
People are fucking stupid
Wait I donâ€™t get whatâ€™s happening
Why did they Paniced?
Worst music ever created
i was in one of these before at a 6ix9ine concert and bayside downtown miami 4th of july stampede its the scariest thing ever if your stuck in there
Music kept blasting the entire time lmaooo chaos!!!!
I love it, I love when looking people panic and screaming bechause they just thinking about Themselves and don&#39;t care about other people
My cluster-phobia is quaking right now
WHY ARE YOU FILMING!?!? GO FUCKING HELP PULL A BROTHER OUT!!!!<br>Honestly the first clip really bothers me, don&#39;t stand filming like a moron, go fucking help! Damn idk if the channel owner is the one that&#39;s filiming, but whoever filmed i want you to know i loathe your very existence
Crazy party
Is this why EDC isnt allowed bsck in CA ?
Everyone is so stupid, donâ€™t climb on top of each other while there is already a pile of people
lmao, the music HAHAHAHA
If you&#39;re into this brain dead type of music, you need your head examined.
Security aint helping just making shit worse
And this is why I always leave a little before end time at big festivals... not trying to get caught in a stampede.
Lmao i was at $uicideboy$ concert it was so packed i was getting crushed i look to the side of me and theres some girl crying screaming she cant breathe and everyone was just stepping on here that scared the fuck outta me so i starded to climb on poeple trying to go to the back ..lmao now that i look back at it its kinda funny but hope that random girl made it out
They&#39;ve come a long way
Dam what happened
These people are human waste, I wish they all would&#39;ve died, the species wouldn&#39;t suffer.<br>The greatest way out of a human crush is to carry a gun. Point it in the air and squeeze twice, the &quot;POP, POP&quot; will generate a hole around you.
Song @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=415">6:55</a>?
Is this the LA Coliseum or the US Mexico border ?
Horrible way to die, ribs crushed and lungs punctured, with screaming all around you.
The correct name for this is &quot;crowd crush&quot; or &quot;crowd turbulence&quot;, not &quot;stampede&quot; which is a name for what animals do when panicked.
The way this place was set up on the main stage was the main cause of all this
Being crushed to death? Make sure you scream as loud as you can to make sure you suffocate faster and allow quieter patrons to use your body as a stepping stone.
Those cops and security are terrible and are responsible for the deaths of some of them.
<b>Children screams</b><br>I like that
I work for a Dutch production company and we would like to use a short clip from your documentary if possible. I would like to get in contact with you about the licensing of your video. You can contact me at jelmer.meinderts@<a href="http://nopicturesplease.nl/">nopicturesplease.nl</a>
Why are people so inpatient and start stuff like this
I was there and this was amazing we showed the police who was in control
Stupid liberals.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=109">1:49</a> Involuntary death stare
people standing there, grab hands ya fuck face and stop recording
O.      M.       G.......you can hear and feel the terror...horrifyingðŸ˜®
When the walking dead starts
I was waoting for that cheap fence to break and fall, with all their asses just climbing on it like its a brick wall...Oh it can hold all of us on it&quot; no bitch it cannot
When those fucking idiots were getting crushed I was squealing with laughter all that fear and pain... Delicious!!
I was there and it was absolute mayhem. There was almost a stampede in one of the tunnels at TAO the year before that. Actually feared for my life.
I was in a similar situation 3 years ago on new year .... and after that I avoide crowded place.
Grab those white girls assess. Let&#39;s get crazy.
This looks so stupid and childish. I have no desire to be apart of this. I sure wouldnâ€™t burn good money on it.
Seems like i go to EDC Los Angeles and Dallas Someone has To Fucking Die Old Fucked Up Times Man.
people are like cows . stupid
Fkn badass
Bad, bad crowd control.
what even happened to make everyone panic and stampede like that
Wow electronic music used to really suck back then
The dude who pulled the cops leg lmfao epic.
So scary I went to this I was on the bleachers though I didnâ€™t know this happened I knew dumb ass people  jumped fences though. This is horrible omg.
Cop: what does over capasiblity mean to you<br>Me:
I got an anxiety attack just watching this
nothing learned from Duisburg
Lots of groping on girls
People are too fucking crazy
Sickest mosh pit I&#39;ve seen.
Shut the fuck you in LA not Germany
LA is such a shit hole
Beautifully organised public event.<br>Not.
Huh, same day as the love parade tragedy.
White people
The screaming female should be taught to keep all that air inside her lungs. Where it will do her body more good.
Shit america best europe
LA is an Open Septic Tank that needs to be flushed....
quite the well orginized event
human crush
I was there
No offense. this is GOLD haha!!
Can&#39;t they just use barbed wire on fences and a double entrance gate where only one gate can be opened at any one time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=84">1:24</a> hahahah wtf is this a horror movie?
just think if they actually listened instead of trying to trample over each other this would of never happened
Watching this got my blood boiling... especially the one that pushed the cop.. wow no respect at all what so ever
I&#39;m just honestly confused what&#39;s happening
the funny thing about this is that this isn&#39;t what got edc kicked out of LA
Reminded me of a tragedy in my hometown Minsk, Belarus. When there was a beer festival and the rain with large hail started pouring and people charged into a metro station, as a result 54 people died in that stampede
Hahahaha
Nah that shit is scary people get smothered to death. It&#39;s almost happened to me a couple times, this is what it&#39;s like. You literally cannot move people are so compressed and &quot;Squished together&quot; You can breath and everybody else is trying to breath so the air gets hot and thin. You start to panic and struggle your way out but you can&#39;t. Youre at the mercy of the mass. When that happened to me there were people all around me screaming &quot;I can&#39;t breath!&quot; &quot;Help me!&quot; and the one I remember most clearly was some young girl Stuck on top of me screamed &quot;Oh my god I&#39;m going to die&quot; that moment was one of the most terrifying because I could not breath because I was being crushed by a layer of people and when i did catch a breath i was just inhaling the breath of somebody else, it was hot and gross. I thought I was going to pass out but the people were getting helped up,  the surrounding crowd picked the people up off of me and then helped me up.  I don&#39;t think anybody was harmed but it&#39;s a real adrenaline rush!
that&#39;s why they decided to stop EDC Los Angeles
the badder states
This is exactly why raves should&#39;ve stayed underground like they were in the 90s. They were smaller and this shit didn&#39;t happen. Too many stupid underage people high on drugs in one place is a recipe for disaster. similar happened at ultra in Miami a few years ago And nearly killed a security guard. After that they put in 15 foot fences surrounded by concrete barriers use the NASCAR races and double fenced it all. Like they should&#39;ve done the first place when police warned them that their fencing was not adequate. with crowds this big people who throws events really need to think things out better when it comes to safety
the cops were like back the fuck up while the people were like fuck off ya dumb ass BITCH
Wow are we having fun yet - fucking douche bags lol
Perfect for zombies
California Sucks !!!  Mexicans ruined  California !
Its the morons at the rear who think they have to push against the ones in front of them. These idiots create the pressure.
Amazing. The guy who pulled the cop&#39;s leg is a hero. People looking out for each other, this is how it needs to be.
I wonder if they the people in the video ever go back and watch this. Lol
Somebody cut the music off until everything is brought under control
I can&#39;t figure the fence jumping.  Are the sneaking into the event without tickets, or running away from something.
Now, THAT&#39;s a mosh pit.
LOLOL As the happy house music is playing...  WHEEEEE YAAAAYYYY HAHAHAHAHA
reading these comments make me cringe
What a bunch of fucking morons.  That&#39;s California for you.  Bunch of dumb ass liberals.
Bunch of stupid people.
First being of video How even did that happen? Wtf
people-plug lol
The fuck happen to that bloody chick
Geez, these security guards should have yelled to the crowd to move back. I see them only bending down trying to pull the crushed people out. The crushing stops when the crowd moves back. WTF?
why are people jumping fences for?
Why are people mad at the fence-hoppers? Can someone explain?
Not Plur at all thank god it&#39;s in Las Vegas now
anyone know how this shit started ?
Does anybody actually KNOW anybody in this? Someone who got trampled? Particularly the girl with blood all over her face? Thank you!
animals like this dont appreciate edm. <br>the music in yhe back is poppin though
Lol
I feel so bad for the security working at this event that year :( usually security is super nice, keep people safe, and give free waters at edm events.. I hope that girl bleeding ended up okay
The LA colosseum looks way to small for edc and apparently was. I&#39;m sure more and more people go every year though. It would have been nice to experience edc in la, I used to think, until I saw this video. It sucks people have to act this way..  Can someone tell me why  people are jumping the fence ?
Someone needs to give the guy at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=368">6:08</a> a fucking medal! He seriously saved that guy from being arrested
awful organisation and general lack of a duty of care to anyone by those whom are trying to organise it. chaos
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=102">1:42</a> Was he dead?
thats really is sad.
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN EXACTLY?
lmao
I used to go to EDC when it was out here but wasn&#39;t at this one... I think what&#39;s sad is that some ppl will see stuff like this first on the news etc... and think it&#39;s just ppl trampling one another. I&#39;ve been going to raves big and small since 2008 and never had anything like this happen. They&#39;ve all been pleasant positive experiences. Then again I never tried to sneak into areas I shouldn&#39;t be in or rush somewhere or push to the front. I like to hang back in the area&#39;s with space to dance. I think if this was the norm so many ppl wouldn&#39;t go. you&#39;re bound to have some sort of issues with so many ppl... someone is always gonna misbehave I guess <b>shrug</b>
Dam that sucks I feel for those people died in the rave.
If you ever find yourself in a similar situation as this one, look for an alternative exit and don&#39;t panic.
this people kill raves
How did this happen?
PLUR everyone!! <br><br>Fucking dumbasses...
Fucking trash
This is why music festivals are being banned
The first part of this video shows what people don&#39;t understand about these &quot;stampedes.&quot;  It&#39;s not like an animal stampede, with people just aggressively running down and trampling people; they all just get stuck, usually at some kind of pinch point like these narrow stairs.  Think of it like a pileup on the freeway.  Somebody falls or too many people side by side get wedged in the opening, the people much further back don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened and just keep moving, and the people in front of them get pushed into the stuck people, so the clusterfuck just keeps getting denser and denser.  Meanwhile, people start panicking, trying to escape (because they&#39;re literally suffocating), and that makes it worse.  <br><br>And still, even seeing it happen right here on camera, people say all the usual hateful shit - &quot;Fucking idiots, I hope they all died&quot; and all that bullshit, when you can see it has nothing to do with people being stupid or rude, any more than a giant car pileup does.  It&#39;s a failure of crowd control, and the blame is 100% on the people who designed the venue and organized the event.
People are morons.
However, more common causes are when the crowd are trying to get toward something as in the former examples, because the crowd is so big that those in the back continue pushing forward not knowing that those in the front are being crushed.
wait what happened what did the drugged kids do?
the best part was watching all of them suffer
The screaming security guy makes a capital mistake with his screaming!<br>Never scream to avoid any panic! Speak loud but not aggressive!
Security and officers, are, like in all those stampedes or crowd crushes, worst than useless, beating and arrest people for trying to escape, shame on those bullshit disorganized basterds.
Rule of large numbers.
Damn, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t witness one of this at Edc this year. They need a bigger place now it was so amazingly crowded, Saturday night especially. 
Omg :**(
The show must go on
Just seeing the lady at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=89">1:29</a> made me so furious. IM GLAD EDC IS OUT OF THE FUCKING SHIT HOLE CITY. SOME DUMBASS ASS IGNORANT PEOPLE IN LA 
And this is why they made it 18 and older. There&#39;s also no more EDC in California. 
LOL
And I won&#39;t forget my sister that died and this party R.I.P I hope you and God&#39;s glory and for all my brothers and sisters out there miss you guys and I love you guys
This is one of the reasons why I stopped supporting this kind of behavior people are so stupid and cheap if you don&#39;t have a job if you don&#39;t have money cannot go to a party you broke ass if you come in peace with love you&#39;re welcome I stop party in 2001 I was tired of being the paramedic the police support what support idiots money hungry mother fucking promoters
Wie Dum die Leute sin so Doof kann man doch nicht sein echt selber Schuld wenn es da Verletzte und weil es ja so Sau Dumme Leute gibt ,auch leider Tote gibt . Das ist MaÃŸlos Traurig wie sich Personen Verhalten ,unterste Schublade
Yo these girls look like skanks like really
Only Idiots OD at raves smoke or take your own shit and drink a lot of water mascotsÂ 
Holy shit. Why are the guys the only ones getting taken by the police. I feel bad for the cops that had to work there that day.
should have shot the people who pushed and caused this stampede. Just station some army soldiers and let them carry out the same protocols as if under martial law.
this is why it is 18+ and cali lost their edcÂ 
Omg this is like world war z but worse
This is not a real rave, back in the days, we never acted like this, even though most of us were only like 14 or 15 years old.
what is the song at the beginning???
Oh look a fat tard not helping and keeping people from helping. 
Packaged meat
I like how they say people who go to raves are chill and calm and nice but they freaking kill each other yeah there peaceful
Your so dumb so you blame all these people stupidity on Christian 
what the fuck? you aare all stupid?<br>why dont you just call superman or spiderman?<br>afterall they are also live in america.. so it is possible they will be there in a matter of minutes..<br>STUPID PEOPLE
they almost died for some shitty music
Wow these people are careless. Makes me glad to have never gone to any of these types of parties...Â 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=86">1:26</a> omg that poor girl got messed up!! 
HAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
not much of a stampede if nobody died.
This is why I stop going out to certain events. When it gets overcrowded, your either watching a fight, hearing gun shots or as you can see in a stampede. You just can&#39;t fun when idiots get out of control.
They are hitting cops yet are afraid to break a gate down???
XD XD XD XD XD XD
Just make the fences electric. Problem solved.
Animales
ONLY HELP THE SINGLE CHICKS!!
Only losers are the ones with bad luck like that lol, poor girl
THAT&#39;S WHY NOO MORE EDC L.A.!!! PLACE LOOKS TO SMALL D:
chaos at it&#39;s finest....
Still wanna do drugs? Â 
I&#39;m so disgusted with these people.
Why are they so slow getting over the fence? Put on some cloths that aren&#39;t so fucking tight your going dancing. XD
all those kids shooda kicked the living shit outta the security goons !
iÂ remember this, was crazy as fuck, the problem was the sercurity where not letting people in or out to the main field which in return started this, i was edc 2006 - now so ive seen quite a bit. none the less it was aÂ inability of poor planing to the main field, another problem was that there where no bathrooms on the main field which also caused problems
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=290">4:50</a> CALVIN WOOO
lol security is being to nice they jump the fence 86 there ass Â out of the event. no wounder la lost edcÂ 
Disgusted!
WTF?
I know this is an old internet term but... lol
This is why the American Dance Music Scene in so looked down on. These aren&#39;t ravers! These are idiots trying to cheat the system! Pay for the ticket if you want and you wouldn&#39;t have a problem. Makes me sad that I&#39;m part of this generation of morons. Smh
Anyone know the first song @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=60">1:00</a>
I fart at a party and everybody runs. Go figure
hahahaha, lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=367">6:07</a> my hero
Was that Snookie @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu4DlwE0Bu8&amp;t=83">1:23</a>?
still don&#39;t know why did they panic ??? americans hahahha
That&#39;s what all you stupid rave fucks get and I bet they&#39;re still spending $300 for the next one. Check yourselves children! Check into rehab!
Bloody beetroot :)
and they say PLUR is still alive....
I apologize for the rude comments but the girl should&#39;ve have known not to do that and so she paid the consequences for it she shouldn&#39;t have went 
so are these people not allowed to dance?
What happened to Peace Love Unity Respect... Plur? .-. Thats what raves are all about.
Fuck you how do you even know those are Mexicans?
People in Cali have no brains
OK, well, that looks great. I&#39;ll pay money to be exposed to injury or death by panic, while other people bounce around and wave their hands in the air.
Fuckin crazy shhiit
I live in oc california.
i hope they didnt take x before this happened. fuuuck

what a cluster fuck
And this is the reason why they ban raves in LA. 
I&#39;m not even there and its bringing my blood pressure up O.O ehhh

What the fuck made them panic
4:34 DAMN! What are the chances that, that one black kid had to be the one to get caught LOOOOL!!! Poor guy.
Good for you..and for the people that want to take drugs have their own personal decisions to make, so good for them also. Who gives a shit. 
Stupid California rave ! That&#39;s why I live in Lithuania :D
1:22 oh god put it, out of its misery
Just throw a match in there and ease their suffering. 
Cthulu came thats what caused panic
What happened to cause the panic?
Now what if there&#39;s a fire or some shit, how they ass gone get out with all them damn crowded people out there
when there are this many people at a function wouldn&#39;t it be an effective lifesaver to have a bull horn?
Many people have been crushed to death and I think that security would be issued something that could be loud enough to reach much further back into a crowd that them just yelling...yelling like everyone else is which is why no one is paying attention.several rows back and just pushing harder to get people moving not realizing the danger.


i love raves and i dont need drugs to feel good. im there to enjoy the music. Music is MY DRUG
Cause California is pretty much all Mexican. 
Well, I guess we know now what the inspiration behind World War Z is
All the raver girls I know from Cali are latino for some reason. Anyone know why there are so many latino female ravers in Cali????
nvm. I know why. 
Why were they Panicing?
p.s good thing lil wayne saved the day.

looks crazy, got no clue what the fuck everyones doing and why everyone jumping the fence and shit but whatever looks dope/retarded at same time
Yeah, I was talking about the gangbangers and starfuckers, in and near LA.
WALK DOWN THE FUCKING STAIRS INSTEAD OF HOPPING THE FENCE WHY ARE YOU EVEN DOING THIS
Well I&#39;m never going to EDC now
Wow its all wrong now. its about peace love unity and respect ...what happend?
dumb asses
Seriously, ive seen this kind of thing at rap concerts, people fighting each other to get to the floor, this is lame. every event ive been too its so chill you can just ask to move up if you want, noone is fighting. this is sad.
Stupid Californians..........
Don&#39;t blame every teen, not all of us are retarded like these guys. :/
haaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!
Rave&#39;s should all be 21 and over..problem solved. 
Who said they didn&#39;t have tickets? It&#39;s just a banch of kids from the sitted area  that decided (stupidly) to jump their way closer the stage.
Wrong in so many levels.
... And this is why EDC moved to Las Vegas.
wtf thats fucking pathetic i dont understand why they were in the stadium if they didnt even have tickets. fucking spectators always ruining everything!! its called getting a job and purchasing tickets fucking animals!!
I was just saying that today before I saw this video.....there not humans, there sheeple. This isn&#39;t a rave. Idk what to call it, no plur, no respect, no positive vibes. 
going this crazy for something is stupid....this aint a rave...kids trying to party
steve aoki ftw

WHERE THE FUCK IS P.L.U.R
This is how people die in nutclub fires like the one that just happened in Brazil. Everyone crushes up to the front and then everyone gets stuck and nobody can move to exit the building. 
Man these people are stupid af.
You have to be 18 to go to EDC...
What do you expect in California? Stupid fucker
i&#39;ve lost my faith in humanity... what a dumass and stupid world i live in.. i&#39;m ashamed of those &quot;humans&quot;.
always some dipshit raver ruining the whole thing... then again dont want to panic and run with idiots, end up getting trampled to death. another year electric daisy or nocurnal wonderland someone scream &#39;anthrax&#39; and you can imagine the nightmare quarantine that followed.
america is full of shit haha
But it pisses me off all the same that they were acting like that lol However I am proud of dude who helped bro out with that cop...
Were not all like this. Ive never seen this at an East Coast festival.... This is kinda why I dont see edc as fun....
this is how you get fun events like this shut down, by doin stupid shit
that no rave
over-population......
So fucking true.
Well yeah, about 95% of the people that go to EDC are just rolling hipsters and never been to a real rave before.
maybe, but I guess im fucked up too
Dude I am 14 but I cant wait to go to this in like 5 years because my birthday is in November so I will be 18 I have to wait another year to get in
What the fuck happened to P.L.U.R? Raves are about music and having fun, not this fence jumping stampede shit.
wat a mess!
Is it just me or did anyone else get a kick out of the police wrestling those dumb shits to the floor?
 P.S And its likely these same kids that say &quot;fuck the police&quot;. there is a reason they are authorized to use force.

obese guy telling ppl to back up meanwhile hooligans behind his back kicking the people wtf! idiot ...
Fuk 
yea I was so Der la bittches
This is not a rave period. These are not ravers period. Most are just hipsters trying to be something they are not.
BUNCH OF IDIOTS. They ruined the fun. only hispanics do this type of shit, im hispanic myself and ashamed of their stupidity. cant party and have fun? then stay home or at your damn house parties. smh! 
Only 1 Person But That Was From Drugs .-.
How many people die at edc each year I&#39;m 10 and I don&#39;t think those guards should be strangling those people :/
She died and you call her a dumb bitch for that? Kinda fucked up, didn&#39;t know people as festivals were really apathetic and assholes.
no the girl who died OD&#39;d, and she was hispanic was brown hair. i think this girl was white with black hair
one person died. not in this. she OD&#39;d. dumb bitch ruined EDC for so many people, she was underage and not even supposed to be there
Some of those people died. Wtf do you think
...
They have Daft Punk, Madeon, Justice, Avicci, Armin Van Burren. These are some of the biggest DJ&#39;s in the world and they started it. And you&#39;re gonna say they dont have good djs? Oh God.
Is the girl at 0:24 the one who died?
Only at soccer games right?!  Euro trash.

this isnt a rave its fuckin chaos u dummys are why this shit will die...goddamn this pisses me off
they deserve it for raving.....raving is fucking stupid
why the fuck is everyone stampeding?! how terrible. i had to stop the video like five seconds in because i couldnt even watch it or hear the people screaming. what is wrong with people?! raves are supposed to be about patience and love and respect and the MUSIC!!! not drugs or getting on the main floor to get closer or being a douchebag and shoving your way past a bunch of young kids. those kinds of people dont belong at these events.
This is fucking ridiculous. What Dumbasses!
Stay in the bleachers people :)
in the description i thought it said 15th annual Disney Carnival i was about to be liek wat the fuck
;( why was that sexy teen bleeding from her face and I can hear when love takes over or clocks at the end of the video
ha

crazy fuckers .... guard rails completely fckn useless
There is a difference between ravers and raGers. These are ragers. These wouldn&#39;t happen at a rave.
Wtf come to England will show u what ravin is all about haha these ain&#39;t ravers
fuck what are you doing?do you have a video at that time?go and help they are dying...FUCKKK
music at 2:33 please
i hope that all the people in this video know that they are ALL idiots for not listening. why cant fuckin people just listen to the rules. theyre the reason why edc might get banned..dumb shits
stupid idiots. if they stayed where they were instead of acting like a bunch of fucking animals this wouldn&#39;t have happened. twats
Bunch if fuckin idiots that dont know how to party, this never happens in europe!!
2:17 song?
many stupid sluts.
I&#39;m so proud to be a human
@Croationbabee  WHAT THE FUCK IS WITH THESE COPS.  thats security the under paid and take too much bull shit from stupid people who cant read a damn sign, IT SAYS EXIT ONLY. DAMN KIDS KILL IT FOR EVERYONE!

nice background music

LADIES, LADIES, LADIES, MAKE SOME NOISE!!!!

its all because of this almost everyone started to hate the rave scene, whatever happen to PLURR oh ya it died when this shit happened, and cant rlly blame the lawmakers cause look at this video it just has hell writing all over it, if they had more further info on why the girl died its her fault for popping shitty rolls at a young age

LOL 6:09 that dude pulled the security guard away xD
0_0 i have no words....
0_0
man this shit is fucking hilarious. im soo high, i cant wait to try and jump the fence for lollapalooza :]

People need to learn to take much better care of themselves. 
I know that they probably do, but they also need to learn to exercise that better judgement, especially in a place like that.
half those ppl are SO NEW TO THE SCENE 

@DeeSee25 right? I wanna know what they had to say about this...
well all i got to say is my 3day experience in edc las vegas this year was nothing like this... no wonder why its not in LA no more... i mean look at this its really sad to see =/ 
What the fuck is the point in going to a rave that big? No room to dance, no room to breathe. That is scary &amp; absolutely asking for trouble...
in all of my raving i cant even believe this shit this is what gives the whole scene a bad name incidents like this i wanna cry watching this i hear screaming and its not of people having fun and partying its the sound of people legitimately scared to death so disrespectful.
Hello #UN#, how are you doing?  I like dthe page and wanted to say hi.
U dont hear about this in EDC advertisements! lol.
thats why if i go to rave im gonna be da dj
not in da crowd where im gonna get killed

man. this is whats wrong with the whole rave scene these days. everybody gets all fucked up and just gets outta control. nobody cares about anybody else. and just acts like assholes. raves were some of the funnest nights of my life. i never had to witness or go through anything like that. its too bad.
I give mad props to da foo who kicked the cop.
Wth your problem dude you should have been helping them instead of videoing!
This new generation of ravers are a bunch of dumb ass irresponsible little kids! I raved back in the early 2000&#39;s. 2000-2006 and never did incidents like this ever occur! Its this laced ecstasy that makes them all crazy and stupid! It&#39;s not pure MDMA like it was back in the good old dayz!
Does anyone know the name of the song starting at 2:19? I&#39;ve been working my ass off to try to find it... Let me know if you know it!
i dont understand why that security guard doesn&#39;t help, he&#39;s more interested in checking thir tickets.
so why was every  one panicing and jamed in the beginning. i dont rave so i have no idea whats going on
