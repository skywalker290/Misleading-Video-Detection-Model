Wow
This videos are 10000% Fake. I can explain in details if you want.
My homeless man just slept right there for 3 years
Thank you.<br>What I think? Anyone gifted as an artist can forge a painting to appear old, and slip in something modern, including UFO&#39;s.<br>The rest are down to editing. The ability to do that is decades old.<br>I expect it brings a laugh to those involved though. The sort of thing I might do for a chuckle.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvN1ZQzGUqM&amp;t=214">3:34</a> even a sperm cell would know thats fake
I&#39;ve seen this original photograph on wikipedia.  He supposed to be a messenger boy with a folded letter and envelope in his hand. <br>I don&#39;t know how people see an iPhone. <br>It would be something if it was, I personally prefer an iPhone over Samsung Galaxy.
Theory, fake and  ?
If i had money and knew this 4 years ago, id have found that station and waited for 2019 01 30.
2020 coronavirus 💔😭💔😭💔😭
I’m repeated to Pieter De Hooch
Wait anyone notice that there was a homeless man in the corner of the walls you can see a head move when they end the video so this I&#39;d fake
Wow they had to put it in black and white to make look like it was reall wow
Just look at effects
It change from 2016 to 2019 wath will happend this year why did it pick this year
Nothing... is impossible!

silicone transportation..
Lol its fake dont belive him . Its <b>PHOTOSHOP</b>
its hair brush
Lies.
The object in the painting could be anything , just because it may look like a smartphone i guarantee it isn&#39;t. The rest are all cgi and pishy editting. Get a grip.
there are such things as photoshop
It&#39;s a comb!
Oh my goodness!😒Stop being so melodramatic! These people aren&#39;t Time Travellers AND all of these have been faked. The knowledge of Time travel is only in the hands of 7 people from the FTP! By the way, when you time travel, it&#39;s not like this! GEEZ! People
Its a letter
Well as this painting is called &quot;Young woman with a letter and a messenger in an interior&quot; I&#39;m going to assume that is a letter in his hand and not an iPhone 😉
i wanna do it Dang can i get my break 😡😡😡😡😡😡

Nice Paint
Totally bogus. That&#39;s a Blackberry!!!!!!
this is the fucking fack video i will explain you <br>1) We cant seen that iphone clearly so we cont fix that is iphone i think it is any gift box it may fack.<br>2) With my basic Knowledge no cctv cam will fix below 8 feet in open area or outer area it is fack.<br>3)  If the person travel from feature to present in side of the shop then why he did&#39;t open door while coming out, <br>      if he travel out side then how his image catcher in side the shop while going back to the feature, that time also did&#39;t open the door.<br><br>my theory is time travel is not possibly
wo iska kya use karte uus samey network or charging point kha tha
Its a brush shes brushing her hair. Damn Tim Cook is to stupid to work for Apple....
that is just one of 4 ways to jump (TELEPORTATION)
lol I&#39;ve never thought that Keemstar videos could be 300 years old
So...why do people post things they know are fake and make up stories? There are some legitimately cool and fascinating things going on with people and in nature that are hard to explain, but we got yo-yo&#39;s like whoever made this video cluttering the facts with nonsense...and why?<br><br>The 2nd video just looks like youtube darling PeanutButterGamer in one of his many videos. In fact, I would almost bet a paycheck that is who it is.
guys look carefully it&#39;s a mirror fouls
Its a child&#39;s Chap-book. It was used as a spelling and writing aid and it was made of horn or bone.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvN1ZQzGUqM&amp;t=90">1:30</a> FAKE
Time Travelling is certainly probihited. Time Travel is a crime prophecy.
The painting is real, but that&#39;s a book.
it&#39;s Def not an iPhone. ..I can see the screen isn&#39;t cracked!!
fuck off
porn is more realistic than this
hahaha fake
Not a phone - he&#39;s saying, &quot;Honey, can you fix my favorite belt? The strap is coming loose right here.&quot;
koşunca inandım bence feyk değil
Ha ha hassiktir.
yav he he
and adobe after effects discovered.!!!
Whoever does believe these kind of video and photo editings are pure stupid. That&#39;s why we can&#39;t move on and stuck in the past.
fake and gay
lololololololol im a guy from yesterday and thanks of my bed machine i just timetraveled today
im coming from future ww3 in 2019 believe me...
It&#39;s a hair brush... An apple iBrush.
I am the guy that time travelling by jumping in the park. God dammit you saw me?
darbeyi haber veren de zaman ötesinden gelen bir ulak. paralel evrende darbe gerçekleşti çünkü. evet,paralel
hııı<br> bak şimdi ben yazarken birden yok olu.........................
Time Travel is one of GOD POWER in Heaven :)
Must...troll...have to...resist...ok I can&#39;t. This is all crap. It&#39;s blatantly obvious. Painting is &#39;man handing letter to woman&#39; and the &#39;cctv&#39; footage looks as fake as a high school AV project done the day it was due. Case closed.
A video full of some very clever editing.
Why is it all ways an iPhone  not a HTC or Samsung,  every (so called) piece of photographic evidence   with a mobile all ways an iPhone.  Is apple trying to sell phones to the conspiracy community through these vids?
who you goner call? ghost busters yep
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
guys the the one after the first isent real
we can&#39;t time travel now it&#39;s 2016... Why the heck would they have a contemporary iPhone? by the time if ever time travel is possible 2016 will be ancient fuckin tards...
HAIR BRUSH
i believe it is possible
If i had a time machine, I&#39;d to next sat and get lottery numbers.😂😂😂😂😂
No the security camera looks like it&#39;s waist high off the ground to low to be real.
Idiots! it&quot;s not a phone, it&quot;s a letter! The painting is called &quot;Man Handing a Letter to a Woman&quot;.
I&#39;m sure if you asked an art historian they would tell you what De Hooch was satirising or insulting his subjects with by having the girl hold something-artists used codes to say their aristocratic subject was vain/an idiot/had STD and so on to say what they thought and keep their fees and heads
shouldn&#39;t think there were that many radio mast around then for him to make a call
so who you can a call yes you got it answers on a post card please
I think see was time traveller<br>I have doubt how they draw like thet
Person on the left ?
i think is a remote for a plasma tv
The pinting meybe show something, that we dont now what is it odhers stuf is yust krep from USA people making fun. And some of you iwen belive in this shit
I really hope that none of you really believed this one because first off that could&#39;ve been anything but NOT a electronical device could have been a small book or something else BUT NOT A ELECTRONICAL DEVICE.!!!
yes exactly what you said..also she is playing pokemon go trying to catch that dum pikachu...
the third one seems editing... i dont think a time traveller will end up in public thru some machine thats already their
Lol that time travel video was fake :D
It&#39;s not an iPhone, it&#39;s a letter. The name of the painting is &quot;Man hands letter to woman in hall&quot;. It&#39;s at the the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. But check out another Pieter De Hooch painting, &quot;Barmaid takes selfie&quot; -- <a href="http://image.invaluable.com/housePhotos/sothebys/92/111592/H0046-L03780671.jpg">http://image.invaluable.com/housePhotos/sothebys/92/111592/H0046-L03780671.jpg</a>
If you look at the entire picture you will see that the lady has a little dog on her lap and a bigger dog is in the middle of the room, looking at his master (the guy with the so called i-phone) and trying to sneek away. If you ask me the man simply holds a brush to brush his dog (who doesn&#39;t like that very much), but he holds it with the brush hairs to the back, so you only get to see the narrow back of the brush, which indeed looks a bit like an i-phone.
The first one is a hairbrush!
Hair brush.
the first one is a book
In case you guys were confused, he meant the guy on the right, not the guy on the left.
it&#39;s not a cell phone, No Service Exist back the, but it could be a small book she is handing to the lady to read. a lot of books were also made pocket book style.
while i agree that it is probably fake consider this - anyone able to time travel may also be using a device that operates differently than what we are used to. So although it looks like a cell phone it maybe something else that runs independent of carriers or electricity...also it may not be time travel in the sense of 1990 versus 1890 but maybe it is dimensional travel...
it was iphone 4 or 5?
Yes, I notice on the video of the man walking thru the wall...that&#39;s not a wall...that&#39;s a double glass door...notice the closed sign on the door, I also notice in the center...is a door pull
hah, but a smartphone would have been useless, with no electrcity and no infrastructure so Cell Phone signals.  so this Paintig ist just a fake!
the cctv footage is far too clear for my liking
if you&#39;re afraid that people may see you t traveling you should look around not just only behind you..................................... common sense please....
edited pictures hays the gradient of the picture with cp was obviously changed
I think that if time travel is possible the Government will figure out how to do it and make a lot of mistakes in the process. We will then have to pay a lot more taxes so that they can figure out what they did wrong and fix all the mistakes they made disrupting history. Then they will charge us more taxes so that they can try it again.... I love my Country by C&#39;mon - Who invented taxes???
I have an S7 Edge in black and that looks VERY similar to the design of my phone.
This is a card right? I&#39;d never hold a phone like that but I might hold a card like that
At 0.37 the script says! THE MAN IN THE PICTURE IS HOLDING?  Next your say hes Eddie Izzard time traveling, though if it was Eddie hes not wearing his pink berry.
A Japanese fellow who originally spotted this painting was traumatised because it was not a Nokia purchased from his company!  Just shows you how the truth affects people differently.   But the question that should be asked is what net work was he using.
HOLLY SHIT..lol FIRST VIDEO IS A PAINTING DONE IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, NO FROM THE 1600 HUNDREDS. THE OTHER 2 ARE OBVIOUSLY CG..<br>IF YOU WALK BACKWARD YOU CAN GO BACK IN TIME....lol
Everyone are cgi projects.  Openly cgi by their creators.
So where will an iphone find it&#39;s &quot;network&quot; to function at all during the past?<br>It&#39;s pathetic how people can actually believe any of this without actually using their brain and thinking &quot;how would the phone work&quot; if the infrastructure to make it work doesn&#39;t exit yet.<br><b>face palm</b>
I don&#39;t know what it is in the painting but it doesn&#39;t exactly look like an iPhone. The guys in the rest of the video are just actors in some fake homemade films with effects.
don&#39;t forget the eygeptian hieroglyphics with the future flying cars it them
I think the girl in the picture is holding a hair brush ....
why on earth would the time stamping change from 2016 to 2019 it makes no sense and was done to imply supposed time travel,also the first one on the &quot;rural&quot; road looks fake as fuck,the i phone thing looks cool though.
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Interieur_-_Pieter_de_Hooch.png">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Interieur_-_Pieter_de_Hooch.png</a>
HE MIGHT HAVE AN IPHONE BUT IS THERE AN APPLE STORE TO GET A CHARGER FOR <br>THAT IPHONE....  ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvN1ZQzGUqM&amp;t=185">3:05</a> the hobo has seen some shit
I would do anything to be able to time travel a few times, just for fun, exploring and the experience,,, oh if I was allowed maybe a small fortune ( lottery £1.000000 ) will do <br>Also go see my dad back in 1981 before he dies at the age of 34
The second security camera is much more credible but come on, why would anyone do this anyway and why would they need the special effects if not to hide the fact that he doesn&#39;t actually walk through the doors. Surely if you could walk through solid objects why would you bother using the door at all?
A rural security camera just pointing at a path and some trees, yeah right. Also why on earth would you start to run if you knew you could just disappear at will, wouldn&#39;t you just disappear? Many have claimed that this footage is genuine, okay so name one of these many people? Anyone can just many people said this and conspiracy theorists say that but can you prove they actually said these things and if the answer is no then you have nothing but hearsay.<br><br>IT IS A HOAX<br><br>PROOF - evidence or argument establishing a fact or the truth of a statement.<br>HEARSAY - information received from other people which cannot be substantiated; rumour.
Who are these so called conspiracy theorists who claim things?
stupiest bullshit on youtube
it&#39;s a comb
couldn&#39;t you get a hight quality image of the painting?<br>also, that is a very uncomfortable way to hold an iPhone...<br>I wonder if she (it&#39;s a woman holding it, not a man) was looking for connection...
Guys you don&#39;t know about time travel but I do..
the cell phone is just a comb. looks like the person sitting is waiting to be groomed. perhaps by a servant.
if real time traveller was there than we can also know about time travel soon
its not an iphone but a Galaxy note 7 edge
So the iPhone from the future will have a time travel app....awesome!!!
where she reloaded the battery?
where was the antenna ?
Who she calls to?
The guy walking through the wall has been spotted many times.
Second video could easily have been faked.
FIRST of all, it&#39;s the person on the RIGHT, not the left. Secondly, It&#39;s a WOMAN, NOT a man, holding the device! C&#39;Mon man! Please!
The CCTV camera black and white part made me laugh my ass off, nice work guys. Maybe pay for the vegas pro upgrade pack next time
who holds their phone like that!!! it&#39;s like he wants it to fall. hard to believe...
stupid: a mobile phone cannot work without cellular network...
Soooooo fake... XD YOU ALL BELIEVE THIS?!?!? THE &quot;TIME TRAVELING MAN&quot; IS THE MAKER OF THE VID HIMSELF CAPTURING HIM RUNNING AND EDITING HIMSELF TIME TRAVELING XDDD
person on the right
Its a iPhone 7s with whatsapp
if she is holding an I phone in the year 1670 who is she talking to??
Is it not possible the girl in the picture cold be examining a bar of lead? I could possibly imagine the Netherlands being somewhat of a mining community, so therefor it is probable.
this is bullshit!!!
I don&#39;t knw guys... this looks like a Samsung or a Gameboy
man runs and disappears, the best one, they just forgot one thing to do, who walks in park during no leafs on trees with short sleeves. and its usa which most likely thats winter, not even fall. almost perfect video. sorry.
i believe the second one was settup bc as u can see there seems to be a string hanging from one tree to another so when he passes it they would then know to fade him out
What about the space-time continuum... If time travel was real the effects would be terrible. All a hoax.........
The time stamp on a camera is manually set not automatic, so it would not shift during a clip
No time travel without the Time Lords permission    ha ha
Everything true in this video except the music &gt;&gt;<br>^_*
i don&#39;t believe it
it could be a iPhone or something idk. but how would he charge the thing? what if he had used a charger in. lemon and charged it that way?
First thing is that the time travel is a crime.... And this video just wanted to show us that the time travel is possible.... But nobody can make a time machine..... So its steel mysterious.....
To travel forward in time you move faster,, so to travel back in time you have to reach speeds of minus the speed of light
time travel we build time machine - capsule cop.
is the orginal-pic to see? perhaps in any museum? from this pixeled pic here does say nothing
Oh fock that is where my phone went. srry guys had a buggy time warp app. Wanted to warp my shit into diamonds but the fucking app swallowed it into another time era. I am gona sue the shit of apple for this. I want my diamonds!
Weird how all these are straight in front of a camera.... All bullshit lol
second one is that u can use sony vegas to edit it
fake
looks like a hairbrush to me
I know there are too many people that believe they know something about time travel so they try to create the illusion of evidence to make other believe what they believe. Sorry for them and for all who believe these videos are real. Time travel is real, but never is executed doing any fast movement. Even any slow movement at all. Past, Present and Future happens simultaneously. We are part of the less ones on the universe (we the EarthLink’s) that believe there are different states on a straight line of what we believe is time but that’s not true. Everything is recorded on the matters mind of the One. So Past, Present and Future info is available all the time to anyone who knows how make the matter bring its info. Future is already establish, that’s a sad shame because is awful know that whatever you do, include changing decision and actions believing its let you change the incoming events is already planned to happen in that way and nobody could (at least during his time here inside matter) even make a tiny deviation on events. Good, Bad and even Sad and Happiness are ways to describe our level of acceptance of life events but when you know the inevitability of events you became a less reactive person on a leveled state of existence. Remember, there is only one dynamic state of time, Present, the rest is just information to control the way we perceive the present. Some can &quot;travel&quot; true time but is impossible to interact with events on it. Ask to the NSA, they know some things about it. But they won’t tell you. Is a terrific tactical advance, they believe, because they had traveled to &quot;pass&quot; but don’t have already a way to travel to the &quot;future&quot;. Even if they believe they can one day, the reality is that phisical matters only bring them present info to push thing to happen in the way it’s supposed to happen. The third video has nothing to do with time travel but, if real, (I doubt it) could be with the suspension for some seconds of the natural laws of matter interaction. The solid state of matter is an illusion created by some rules that are very difficult to evade but not impossible. The secrets? Sorry, in this present moment I had no idea how to do it.  But there are affinities and resistances to let some part of matter being trespassed or being impenetrable by other manifestation like light pass true clear water or crystals but not true other materials. Or radiations true some materials but no other denser like lead. Magnetism true noble metals but not iron, vibration depending solidity, conduction of heat, electricity,  you named. There is an established elemental order to let that happens, but with some luck (Knowledge) you can bend the laws of physics for shot time but you can’t break it. Don’t waste your time trying to find time travel ways; anyway matter will never let you take any advantages over the already stablished future. Imagine how many millionaires will exist if that could be possible. Even that is already established. That’s why some play lottery all their life and never gain anything and others just by a casualty do it and became millionaires.
Nope time travel is not real , okay if its real how do you travel through time by just walking all of this footage you have shown is not real
People think everything is FAKE! Except Fox News and   CNN ironically..
loue the music
The person in the painting is more likely to be holding a little prayer book. You can see the lace around it. Depending upon which flavor of Christianity one practiced, it was customary to carry books of bible verses and prayer books and cover them with fabric and lace.
O jovem que correr e desaparece esta vestido com roupas atuais...então porque a imagem a preto e branco?...significa que é uma montagem!;)
The supposed iPhone in the painting is likely a card the subject is reading that he was probably given by the artist to look &#39;engaging&#39; to the viewer. Cook convinced himself it was an iPhone. People see what they want to see, even if it is completely preposterous.
In those times, people had to have guidance, hence small prayer books and step books, omg are people that stupid
Idiots, it&#39;s a small prayer book
the girl in the painting was the daughter of Francesco &amp; Mona Lisa, btw puppy is cute :p
Aside from the huge &#39;time travel&#39; leap --There would be a slight problem with having a cellphone or smartphone 350 yrs. ago - no towers, no networks, no infrastructure.  It would be a glorified game platform, and you&#39;d have no way to charge it once the battery ran down.
The first painting is entitled &quot;Man giving letter to woman&quot; it&#39;s not a letter but an iphone, right.    .The new fad of showing people disappearing into light or walking through walls in a flash of light started in the 1950s but has made a comeback do to it&#39;s ease in which it is done. This video is a total fail do to old debunked footage. Do research first.
look at another and of person who is holding iphone ! is it made of iron ? it maybe true
I like the music. : )
it&#39;s a tarot card
My brother is a Dr of time travel and he say&#39;s it is a trance time portal that is doing this and his team has sent people far back in time to 100 AD to 8976 AD and even 2077 so it can be done right now as he himself has gone to 2077 and it looks real good for the UK as it is in it&#39;s golden years as there is no money at all it is all free for all so time travel is real today
its a memory card game, popular during those times
3rd video 90% true<br>1st video 50%<br>2nd video.. 0 % F*CK
Guys we all know that time travel isn&#39;t real you know that it envolves the TIME!! nobody knows how to get the use of time ppl say if earth move on the opposite direction it will take us back time and some says aliens gave us time machines and whatever actually myself i don&#39;t believe in aliens because god only knows what exist in those random planets and universes but i believe in demons because they can appear in random planets taken on footage or something like that
why would he run? he could also go an just right in time disappear#
&quot;Oh the battery is almost dying. Guess I&#39;d better cha....... FUCKKK!&quot;
what bothers me is you guys keep repeating the same scene over and over damn
for me..time travelers enjoying their time traveling different places as far as they can..tsk tsk tsk..they are sooooooo lucky enough to experience that..hahaha
it is not I phone, it is Samsung S352

I am one of the guys in the video. I&#39;m in the year 2030 right now and it&#39;s hella different. Time travel is real guys no joke
The person that goes through the wall, look at the homeless guy he&#39;s like naw there&#39;s nothing just a guy going threw a wall then continues to try to sleep. Maybe he&#39;s high
You said person to the left ITS THE RIGHT
Is he playing Tetris haha
How can it be a phone when you need satellite in space plus phone masks to transmit the signel please come on stop the bull shit now 
Its not iPhone. Its a Samsung s6 edge ..really come on now. I&#39;m sure its not what it looks like were is the real painting held 
yes it is time travel
This is agonizingly idiotic.
How would the phone work without wifi or data during that time there wasn&#39;t electricity
If that&#39;s a real iphone then i should be on facebook searching for his account because everyones got facebook and if we went into the future to get an iphone im sure he has facebook lol
Seeing that the title of the Pieter De Hooch painting is, &quot;Man Handing a Letter to a Woman in the Entrance Hall of a House&quot;, my guess is that it is a letter in his hand and not a smartphone. Google a clear image of the painting and you can clearly see it for yourself. The other clips have been debunked several times.
Could Be a comb its not clear what it is, enjoyed this ideo thanks for sharing.
It does flicker to 2019. Maybe in the future we can time travel who knows maybe he has powers you never know
Gimme three fakes!
This video shows proof that when one is bored at work, they&#39;ll watch anything then comment.  Like I just did.
More dislikes needed.
Fake
Let me make some things clear : First a painting by Pieter De Hooch makes an iPhone in his painting. Then a person normally walks and the CCTV is recording him and he just vanishes with some effects all around. Then this homeless dude witnesses a &#39;&#39;time traveller&#39;&#39; teleport into the shop? And the time changes? Okay The 3rd one is the fakest out of all of these.... The witness is still outside, same garbage and the same car! Okay... Why would a person record another person walking normally and just teleporting? I mean 500,000 human beings take walks at random places and he had to record it without knowing this would happen? Basically its editing as he wouldn&#39;t record that person for no bloody reason....... People these days.... EDIT : It&#39;s not a CCTV. I put it onto photoshop and I checked the quality it can&#39;t be also there is no date no time. Also if it is real why did he look behind and run? You couldn&#39;t even see the shadow of him.... I zoomed it in there is no shadow...  Also IT CAN&#39;T BE AN iPhone! Hooch was really creative and he just made something like that!
i think everyone can paint like Pieter De Hooch painting lol...and 1 more,is that a man or a women??the 1 that holding the IPHONE 6 thingi...only illuminate can do the time travel <del>_</del>,that the 2nd is travelling to hell _ he had just traveled to the wrong way...if there&#39;s any that u can pillowcare with my opinion just reply below because i&#39;m still a spittingkid xD
Maybe it&#39;s not an iPhone. It could be a white Samsung Galaxy S7.
2019-2016 = 3<br>Half Life 3 confirmed
That girl was holding a drawn picture, 2nd and last one special effect that can be done via Maya. How you think movies were made? No such thing as time travel. The chances are better to have sex with 100 girls at once than going back in time.
I can explain how this is fake that &quot;flash of light &quot;  is too bright 😒👎🏼😡
There&#39;s one thing I don&#39;t understand about all of these time travel allegations: how can someone be using a cell phone when there are no cell phone antennas or Internet in those times?
Of course he would &quot;hope&quot; it&#39;s an iphone.
no-one believe in it but I believe it&#39;s real 😀😮😮😮
Nooooo this side of YouTube. Help me
that&#39;s a book or diary.
2016-2019
click-bait bullshit
1670 and he gots a better phone than me 😂😂😂
Bullshit a mobile back then would not work how the fuck would u pick up a signal
LOL you know its an envelope right?  A caveman picture of a square rock looks like an iphone too.
i love that Age of Empires Music...
so is there a possibility that well i just thought of this long time ago but my classmates started teasing me but is it true that all the scientist made a secret land or field by combining they&#39;re knowledge but if it is true they should have been trained and most of all they should have known the place have cctv and cameras right and just what if they have a leader or master cause i always thought that time travelling do exist in my childhood days but i think theyre time travelling and teleporting to save the world cause our is only using 10% of human brain but look what it have us going into global warming and how we gonna save it so i only think they are from a land hidden in times to save our world
That&#39;s not iphone. lol
that i pod xD
the shitty cgi though i cant even
lol 2016  to 2019 its impressive that the guy lying down didnt move for 3 years rofl
there is no such thing as time travel, on the other hand there is adobe premiere pro.
It&#39;s a hair brush is everyone in here a dumbass
look like nokia to me
all is technology trick
time travel my ass the last one lol travel between 2016 to 2019 to get a snack not to help anybody
yes
i think so
The first one may be a small book
I would bet that these are just regular old cards.
The 2nd one is FAKE!!!!!
why show it so many times i wish i had that time back
It has to be a cell phone, I don&#39;t care if the title of painting is &quot;Man Handing a Letter to a Woman in the Entrance Hall of a House&quot;.
ok i looked this up on the Web under more of de hooch paintings and yes this one is real
I believe anything is possible.  Thanks you for sharing your videos. God bless you.
This is a deck of playing cards.
Other than the fact that we have no CCTV cameras in the rural United States, this is a good video.
The young man walking through the door of a Convenience Store would use this technology for a frozen burrito? LOL I&#39;m on my way to Fort Knox!
I truly wish time travel is possible as I believe we could fix a lot of our mistakes. I know about the space-time continuum like in Back to the Future and other movies LOL
maybe one of these people we see are watching this video...
That&#39;s an iPod not iphone ffs
hilarious ,
Sorry...not clear enough to tell WHAT it is...
The first one irl it could be just a piece of paper!
I think it looks like samsung galaxy s3 with the dandelion wallpaper!
What about iPhone charger in 1670 ? Huh ?
Its not an iPhone  its impossible, Its a Nintendo gameboy  :)
It&#39;s fake time travel
It could be a prayer book. In fact, that&#39;s probably what it really was.
in the second vedio if year change to 2019 then why didn&#39;t the time change????? its  a trick
It&#39;s fake I saw carefully
People from the future beyond experiment university playing around learning history very carefully. banned Time Travel machine.
The second one wasn&#39;t time travel it was just teleporting
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvN1ZQzGUqM&amp;t=140">2:20</a> tricky editing? Looks like something made in windows movie maker lol
Why the Fuck does it always have to be a shit I phone......And did men wear dresses then?
every body is being brainwashed but me
Could be an android
I think these videos are made by editing <br>because if it could be real<br> then scientist must have done research on it
@Joviels Kickstarter! \o/
SPEED FORCE ^_^
what is the point of having an iPhone in the 17th century? No network! Who you gonna call? ...However the body language of the guy does indicate that he can&#39;t get a signal...so it must be an iPhone!
I&#39;m telling you this people are very smart they always wear hoodie during time travelling, hiding their face
I believe in time travel
It&#39;s chocolate bar
I say the painting is possibly a smartphone, as for the first video I say it is possibly a ghost disappearing into the woods or towards the afterlife, the second video I say is a hoax
A more mature approach to a video would be to give explanations of what the thing being held is. Perhaps you could call the museum and find out what they tell people it is.<br><br>But know, that would make for a far less stupid video.
don&#39;t believe that&#39;s a phone but there is concrete proof of alien technologies with the Egyptian pyramids plus hieroglyphs of helicopters and flying saucers in many prehistoric caves and paintings.. my point is, it&#39;s definitely feasible there are many different aliens out there but the phone thing is open to interpretation of countless assholes
has anyone ever wondered why the space jumpers, jumpers or time travelers always wear hoodies? 0.o
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvN1ZQzGUqM&amp;t=87">1:27</a> Actually this is called After Effects
First of all, the &quot;time traveler&quot; is nothing more then edited video and it wasn&#39;t even that good.  First, he didn&#39;t just through a wormhole, he started to fade away before the light even flashed.  My guess is that they used Flashes and Muzzles from Adobe After Effects but even I could have made something that looked more realistic than this!!
So instead of holograms, screens in their eyes, micro-projection, or the myriad of other possible future technologies we will all adopt (in the next generation most likely) the people of future use clunky old mobile phones? Or are you suggesting we have time travel NOW?
It&#39;s a woman, not a man, and she is holding a comb.
how would you get service
looks pretty convincing!
lol idiot believers
the kid that did time travel looked behind him to see if anyone was going to see him and then he traveled. that&#39;s my theory
videos are clearly fake
The second one is as fake as dutchtuber&#39;s video&#39;s
no one can go back in time
its fake
It is a hair brush numbskulls
I meant over 168,000 miles per second.
All are proof of Jack Shit!
In order to time travel you have to go faster than the speed of light. The speed of light goes over 280,000 miles per second. That is impossible to do. The only person we know who ACTUALLY can time travel is GOD. He has the ability to time travel cause he is the light.
I&#39;ve just checked an image of the original painting, it is a folded letter that he&#39;s holding in his hand, theory debunked! - scanned image of original here - <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Interieur_-_Pieter_de_Hooch.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Interieur_-_Pieter_de_Hooch.png</a>
Regarding to the painting it looks to me like a hair brush
no iphone ,old hair brush.
He says: &quot;No network! We have to wait a few hundred years! &quot;
Looks more like an iPod
If it&#39;s not an iPhone, it&#39;s not an iPhone.
Why a time traveller goes to 1670 with an iphone? At that time there were no cell phone towers...<br>Oh may be to take a selfie... :)
IPhone not!
I has time travel spell
that guy going to store <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvN1ZQzGUqM&amp;t=179">2:59</a> is weird. I don&#39;t know how they made the clock jump to 2019 tho?? That thing in her hand looks like a voice recorder u know like they do EVP sessions. ;-) Time travel can be done but not with technology as we know it. It&#39;s a spiritual trip.
It is not looking like iPhone, is looking like some good mobile smart phone. But anyway is a brush...
Playing a fake clip of a man running isnt gonna make me believe that is real and it wasnt edited to the max
i think he is reading something to the person in the chair
Microsoft Zune of 1 mb.
Brush they showed that video 20 times
To check the last one wait till 2019 and look at the same camera at the same date and time. and see what happens.
man in the second video is real life &#39;Flash&#39; from dc comics<br>in the third one i really think it time travel. but one thing if the date is changing why ist the time
that dude runnung ???? it took me 15 min to do that same fakery on me pc
I might agree with Noah about that being a brush in her hand.
looks like a card to me
when I thing is time travel was in future how sciencetist do it the time machine.
if it is reall there is chance to check the man who went into shop and steel the ice cream on jan.30.2016 has date changed we can check in same date on 2019.. and conclude abt time travellers.........
The kid running fake af
wouldn&#39;t it have been quicker for the artist to borrow the iPhone and  take the pic with that than to take all that time painting it. would have saved a hell of a lot of time
If Time Travel is real. Maybe it could solve the problem of the many to find a new medicine for the incurable illness. Having this phenomena is powerful but in some other way my leads to mass destruction if falls to wrong hands. Must use this in good and for innovation. Maybe they can give us info about the mysteries about our lost ancestors? Why they left with no evidence??
as fake as any celebrities tits.
see what you like earth people, I see a women read a small book. The front cover is up but hard to see as it looks very thin. Guess no time travel but a opened mind to see what you like to see.
i have to say, definitely maybe its possible...perhaps...
fake. the pic with the cell. he was calling who?. if you have a  prepaid phone not even works if you are not close to an antenna server.  in that time no antennas. no service. no power for the antennas. no power  to charge the phone. even if he is only watching you tube.

It was cool the way that dude looked behind him then took off. It didn&#39;t take long for him to reach 88 mph
I think she has a brush in her hand for the hair to brush it
I am tired of saying &quot;fake&quot;??????
man,,, always the camera shakes when need to capture the real thing .... if it was real.  why would the camera shake ????😉😉
remember this day 2019 -01-30  if i am wong there most be some king of invention come up for time machine
Paint brush
the one with the guy walking through the door is obviously fake, note how when the camera feed distorts when the guy &quot;walks through the door&quot; the MONOCHROME camera shows red and blue. which isn&#39;t possible, like i said, the camera only shows shades of green.
time travel can&#39;t exist ! if someone somehow invent it in the future , at some point he would go back in time to tell us about it !  due to the fact that never happend , its save to say that nobody will ever invent it , not now , not in the future !!!
Uh, I guess; that one of apple&#39;s workers traveled to the past and brought their smartphone with them. Apple must check their own documents for the man&#39;s face too lol
so they had mobile cell masts and wi fi to allow her to use this i phone?????
So, umm... what was the person accomplishing with that iPhone in 1670?  They wouldn&#39;t be able to look anything up.  They might be able to look at their photos, I guess.  At any rate, if anyone was to travel back even 150 years, let alone 350, they wouldn&#39;t be able to communicate, even though they would be technically speaking the same language.  Word connotations, idiom, and syntax all evolve over time.  Think about how difficult it is to understand Shakespeare, which was written more or less in the common vernacular of the day.  Even if one caught on to other people&#39;s meanings they would not be able to make themselves understood without figuring out how to alter their speech patterns and sentence structure, how to speak without using modern phrases and colloquialisms, and without drastically widening and improving their vocabulary.  The CCTV footage is the result of some extremely simple editing.
Okay First of All Why would A security camera TIME FLICKER if a time travel is travelling WHATS THE LOGIC ?? Time affects Technology that is basically a counter??? Doesn&#39;t make SENSE
No body holds a smartphone that way pressing the thumb on the display.  Mr. Cook, being the CEO of apple could not spread his imagination beyond iPhone.  It could be an ordinary leather pouch.  With far fetched imagination you  cam even say it is something that is going to be invented in the future after some 400 or 500 years. There is no limit to senseless  imagination.
So in what year do iPhones come with a handle on the bottom? Look how he&#39;s holding it. smh.....
You ask what I think. I think I wasted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvN1ZQzGUqM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> minutes of my TIME Sans TRAVELling
This is stupid it&#39;s a blackberry
When he turns his head, he looks towards the camera to make sure he&#39;s in shot. defo fake.
teleportation is also possible, maybe time travel.. maybe once you teleport time and space doesnt matter who knows?
its simply a messenger giving a letter to a lady in a vestibule, the entrance hall of a house, located in Amsterdam.
1. It looks like a boost mobile phone or a remote controller for an invention. <br>2. It looks like an Angel going to heaven.<br>3. It looks like an objects teleporter.
She is handing her a letter in an envelope.
Even if the video of the guy disappearing was real, why would it imply time travel? He could just be teleporting or vaporising or turning invisible...
That thing has no icons and no led screen!? Apple likes to say they invented the &#39;square&#39; shapes, but objects in that shape has been around as long as humans have been around.Those videos are fake though.
in 2019 we don&#39;t need doors to get in and out , just walk through it , priceless !
Holding a brush you idiots.
Faker than Donald Trumps campaign , i mean  tupé.  Lmfao
we&#39;re all time travelers,in reality
Sorry this the newest Huawei not an iphone!
if its a touch screen than she is holding it wrong .i.e thumb on screen, even for taking pic nobody holds mobile that way... :P
Good.... Adobe Visual......
So I guess the cellphone towers are in another picture?
They probably got better phone service back then...can you hear me now?
that wasn&#39;t I phone. It may be a card.
for me? it&#39;s not a iphone.. it&#39;s a nokia phone with keypad
it is  a card.
Maybe its a ancient civilization or tim cook is extraterrestrial or something. I still don&#39;t believe this.
pick up your phone. you don&#39;t hold it like that. now pick up a piece of paper....
That &quot;iPhone&quot; in the painting is connected to something
what a waste of time!
It&#39;s a bar of chocolate stupid!
Posibliy An Slip Of Paper WIth Writing On It... U Can&#39;t Belive Everything U See. So Try And Question The Unthinkable!
fake as my lady&#39;s tits
What if its an Android in the painting?
DUMB
you fuking kidding me ? its lumia 950xl
if the one at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvN1ZQzGUqM&amp;t=210">3:30</a> is real then wouldnt of the homeless guy near the thrash disappear and reappear?
i heard that the second video of the man walking through the locked door was actually a time traveller who came to 2016 from 2019 just to steal an ice cream cone because the security in 2019 is better than it is in 2016 and it may cause him a lot of trouble to steal an ice cream in 2019 O-o
Time traveler
I am half cos it looks like a phone but also if you go on google images type in Peiter de hooch 1670 look at the photo screenshot then zoom in it kinda looks like a stack of dollars or money notes but then again i could be wrong as i do believe in time travel myself
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvN1ZQzGUqM&amp;t=44">0:44</a> maybe its a peace of paper
It&#39;s very hard to accept that time traveller is real. <br>The reason is ...how can a human that not exist in nowatime , already travel in the future time.
the same supernatural powers
that doesn&#39;t make any sense why would you bring a phone if there&#39;s no wifi (no joke in serious)
Instead of discussing the &quot;phone&#39;s&quot; brand and model (I know you were just being sarcastic, but even so), have you stopped for a minute to think what the hell would someone do with a cell phone in 1670? There are so many things wrong with that &quot;picture&quot; that I&#39;m not even going to bother numbering them, so absurd and ridiculous they are.
fake
Hand mirror.
I am sad thinking that I had just watched that. Props for the creators of the vids but COM ON! Anyone truly believe this tripe??
As fake as a Thousand dollar bill.
How fuckin stupid do they think people are to believe this shit? A 3-year old wouldn&#39;t fall for this macaroni salad amateur movie tricks, fake paintings, etc.
Looks like a Samsung galaxy s7 edge black Pearl to me
If you know ANYTHING about the De Hooch paining, you`ll know that it`s probably a hair brush. duh!
it&#39;s all fake, but mabey the picture is real but we don&#39;t know, we are going on a guy&#39;s opinion.
I think it is some kind of a hair brush
may be he is playing clash of clans
it might be true if a person from another dimension have this tech they can cross the dimension

lol fake as yuk
Or a silver handle brush 😏
It&#39;s just a notepad.
ok time travel, but from an era with iPhone 4s or 5? - If you have time travel, you&#39;ll be able to deploy other devices , trust me!
2016 and 2019 huuuuuummmmm.... I got it 2016+2019=4035-3966=69  illuminati???
The last guy destorted the time everytime he was on the cctv  amazing but is it real ??
edit
because every little slab is and iPhone... idiots! Tim Cook is a crook and iPhone users are mindless sheep.
I don&#39;t know what Mr Cook knows about time travel but Einstein had some interesting things to say on the subject. Einstein discovered that the speed of light was the key to turning back time. The closer you get to the speed of light the slower time passes and when you exceed the speed of light time begins to travel backwards. So in theory time travel is a definite possibility and many of today&#39;s top scientists believe that time travel has already been invented in the future and that it&#39;s more than likely that we are and have always been visited by people from the future. But the obvious question is if that&#39;s so then where are these guys?...The answer to that question is bad news for anyone who dreams about jumping from one point in history to another and interacting with the people along the way. It has long been known that every single thing, living or otherwise , in every possible universe has it&#39;s own unique rate of vibration. The effect of this is that time travelers from the future would actually be coming from a different universe than ours and because of this their rate of vibration would be completely different than ours. Scientists believe that if these time travelers arrived in our universe they would find themselves in a strange dreamlike world where they could see us but they could not touch us or communicate with us in any way. In fact they could not be able to even  pick up a match as they would not be able to adjust their rate of vibration to enable them to make solid contact with the objects in our universe. This rate of vibration is now generally accepted to be one of the basic laws of quantum mechanics and it functions as a vital safety measure to prevent one universe from physically affecting another. So if we were ever to time travel we would need a spaceship which was fast enough not only to exceed the speed of light but to surpass it by a huge degree. A ship like this must be many years in the future, where it undoubtedly exists already. Who hasn&#39;t dreamed about going back in time and meeting long dead family and friends and maybe witnessing histories great events, but if we could never touch them, talk to them or interact with anyone or anything it would surely become boring after a while...but it&#39;s a beautiful fantasy.
<a href="http://www.myartprints.co.uk/kunst/pieter_de_hooch/the_messenger.jpg">http://www.myartprints.co.uk/kunst/pieter_de_hooch/the_messenger.jpg</a><br>look at that picture of Pieter De Hooch - the messenger<br>looks like some men walking and looks into hes iphone
I can reproduce the kid time traveling on the street and walking through he glass door in just a few clicks. BOGUS.
Fucking time travellers! just won&#39;t proof the truth!!!
There is no such as time travel !
I wonder what editing software was used .
Hey you gave me your card
Haha
Show creepy
u can see the guy time travelling thing is kinda fake because if u look at it really carefully u can see tht just befor he vanished the frames stop moving and then come back again
Its a hair brush!
omggg the flash lol bruhhhh clearly the man is Barry Allen or Wally west lol
its like a mirror
it just happens that the guy walks past a non-rotating cctv camera and catches the teleportation in center screen. also, it looks like it&#39;s a sparsely populated area. nice try.
video #2 &amp; #3 could be the same guy
she&#39;s taking a picture of the girl in the chair
I came across a Creepy video and the # of comments said 666 it&#39;s was creepy I felt a chilling shiver down my spine
i wish i was like them
Nope. Not an iPhone. That is editing!
the person on the left is holding a cat...the person on the right is not holding an iphone....that a sumsung galaxy....get your phones correct
FAKE!!!!#FAKE!+
that&#39;s a razor but still that&#39;s time travel
Amazing :D
nice video but i think this is only a hand sized mirror c:
WAIT THATS MY BROTHER HE IS THAT GUY ON THE SECOND VIDEO
When we present fake news to public we often say word &quot;Unknown&quot; like unknown street, unknown location, unknown village etc, so the information cannot be tracked, because there are alots of people who research before believing any info.<br><br>We also produced black and white to fill editing mistakes.
I fink The Guy that walkt fru The stor. Is Guy whit super powers.😄
its a small book, you can see the cover of it tilted towards the painter&#39;s perspective
👎🏽
this is not time travel..<br><br>we can see clearly in the paint that aliens gave tecnology for the humans
whait what if it was flash
These vids really make u wonder if it&#39;s possible, it&#39;s quite scarey x
I&#39;m glad time travel doesn&#39;t exist, (if it doesn&#39;t exist) cause I wouldn&#39;t want to fix my mistakes, and that&#39;s only because we learn from our mistakes and sometimes, something good will come out of it! It can also sometimes bring others together! Also, that&#39;s why God gave us a life, to learn from our mistakes, so that in the next life, we can do better!
That is a letter that he is handing to the woman in the chair, not an iPhone.
love the vid,  u should make more
fake
the runing man the blue light hand the man who helped cycle oldman in traffic light in china and the man go into the shop without open the door could be same person same man what do you think
Whoa! Well I guess time travelers are real!
