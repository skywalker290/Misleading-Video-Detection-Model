Why this islamist terrorists hate nightclubs?did nightclubs do something wrong to them? ü§î
Why are there muslims especially saudis among the casualties? In a night club? Arent muslims supposed not to be in such places ?
Guys my wife died there pray for here
DID GOD GIVE BRAIN TO YOU ? I GUESS HE DIDN&#39;T. BECAUSE YOU ARE DUMB ENOUGH TO DON&#39;T SEE THE PEOPLE WERE KILLED WERE ALSO MUSLIM !!! LIKE THE OTHER ATTACKS IN ISTANBUL EVEN IN SAUDI ARABIA IN MADINA IN RAMADAN ?!!
It was propaganda attacker was a professional soldier who killed most of the people with headshot. That picture of the attacker was just a decoy. &quot;He accidently&quot; dropped his phone and there was a selfie from him wow. And there was a guy from america who just lay on the ground and showed him self like he is injured after that they asked him how many people were there and he said &quot;crazy people&quot; ment the attackers they were more than one people. And the guy who said that was a jewish american soldier they found out after he leaved the turkey. Most of the people who died was arabic and kids from rich people from arabic countries. Btw that was a famous disco in istanbul on a night like this there must be atleast 20 security people but non of them are to see there. It was a very good plan owner of the disco is one of the bad guys ;)
20 saudis between injured and killed, and the rest are mostly  gulf countries.<br>Terrorism kills everybody.
r.i.p. to the victims of reina from greece
how many have to die before you blame islam for what it is?
I swear New Year&#39;s Eve I was chatting with someone at the bar of a Dallas club about gratitude and the reality that individuals may not make it out of Nightclubs OMG and then this...condolences to the families of the deceased!!!

lets nuke these fucks.. enough is enough
All religions force people to hate one another
could someone explain to me why islam is such a evil religion??
They still have to pay the price for the first genocide of the century.
The people attacking are not Muslim. The people being attacked are not Muslim. I don&#39;t think it can be put much simpler than this.
Tryptophan is a hell of a drug!
Mo Muslims mo problems
Allah Akbar
More peace coming from islam
just another day
Why is this trending?
time to step away from the nightclub scene is not safe anymore
it&#39;s Constantinople and yes I know it needs cleansed.
May Turkey find some, any resolution in 2017
Considering this is just turkey I&#39;d say 2017 has been alright
2016 didn&#39;t go down with out a fight...
The people of Turkey have been attacked several times in the past year alone ,have a bit of compassion for them ,rip to all the victims
Numerous people killed and injured for nothing yet all some people can do is abuse other people ,maybe some of you are fake christians then
The religion of peace back at it again !! ALLAH SNACKBAR !! <b>PEW</b> <b>PEW</b> <b>PEW</b> thats religion for ya folks. Following an ancient book, people cant think for themselves.... R.I.P all the people who lost their life to the true face of religion.
This is what was wrong with 2016 i think i might just donate to a gofund me account that means something after watching this if intrested im leaving a link (<a href="http://www.gofundme.com/those-who-give-should-receive">http://www.gofundme.com/those-who-give-should-receive</a>)
That damn religion of peace is at it again
What country is this?
Damn Islam! Back at it again with another act of peace!
How many times do the racist xenophobic idiots have to start the same argument again, you know that it&#39;s not the whole religion, you just want to be pricks!
dam Nick ex done messed up Russia new years to what 2017
I bet it was one of those radical Mormons I wouldn&#39;t be surprised they&#39;re known for this kinda stuff!
I swear this is why I don&#39;t go in nightclubs becuz it stupid as shit
Stop calling them terrorist. They are Islamic people who are promoting peace with killing. They are apart of your Religon and they are your people. These are people of the same Religon of yours, help them!
While not all muslims our bad, and should be treated with respect, not all muslims are good either. We should condemn the bad ones and support the good ones (especially the victims). Islamaphobia is not the answer, but neither is ignoring the fact that Islam is one of the factors motivating these terrible people.
What a way to Start 2017‚ú®<br>i guess this yr could be almost as bad as 2016
So peaceful
Turkey is reverting back to what destroyed the ottomans
A statement distributed by ISIS said the attack was carried out by a &quot;heroic soldier of the caliphate&quot; who attacked the nightclub &quot;where Christians were celebrating their pagan feast.&quot;<br>It said the man fired an automatic rifle and also detonated hand grenades in &quot;revenge for Allah&#39;&#39;s religion and in response to the orders&quot; of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.<br>The group described Turkey as &quot;the servant of the cross&quot; and also suggested it was in retaliation for Turkish military offensives against ISIS in Syria and Iraq.<br>&quot;We let infidel Turkey know that the blood of Muslims that is being shed by its airstrikes and artillery shelling will turn into fire on its territories,&quot; the statement said.<br>The nightclub was frequented by foreigners, alcohol drinkers, and women wearing dresses cut-off at mid-thigh. ISIS does not consider such people true Muslims.The nightclub was considered a place of decadence. Places of decadence are frequent targets of ISIS.
Those who make this attack are the terrorist organizations fed by America and Europe. Nobody will divide our country. Target 2023
Nobody can divide our country. Surely turkish will dominate the whole world.
ah the religion of peace
Isis seriously isn&#39;t going to give up on killing innocent people and since the new year&#39;s Eve started out in a shocking way, I have a bad feeling if it happens to us in a random place.
British <br>Broadcasting <br>Company
WELCOME TO THE NEW ISLAMIC REPUBLƒ∞C OF TURKEY
So I guess this is what Turkey were returned with after supporting terrorist groups.   You kill a guy?  Our repayment is kill yours.   (And people say America has gun fetish.  LOL)
RIP...
Avoid Istanbul, avoid Turkey<br>Visit Spain, Italy, France, Germany, The Netherlands - the real Europe
fcking internet trolls everywhere
another in a long line of western world government psy ops. swallow it up sheeple, swallow that shit up.
USA mk √ßocuklari ISID&#39;i destekliyen picler
Oh strangers, westerners, We thought you were always smart but we do not have a gram of brain. How do you give them the name of Islam. Isid boss is america. How can you not see killer america everywhere? We live in Islam, we know it is not Islam. This is the new world order that this america and amerikan want
Aaaz
Turkey is too a islamic terrorist nation just like pakistan.....both are the breeds of fuckin dog who they call alla.....time for the world to unite and end this maniac idea of islam from the face of the earth for humanity......
nothing more American then Santa claws and mass shootings LMFAO XD I GUESS THEY WANTED TO BE AMERICAN
This attack could be carried out and planned by Russian intelligence for 2 major reasons. Number 1, The Russian ambassador has been assassinated in Turkey a few days ago. Also, this attack was very flawlessly planned and executed and the assailants were able to escape without leaving a trace behind which is not what ISIS or Al_Qaida affiliates normally do. So, I think people need to open their brains a little bit and think carefully before they point fingers or make assumptions.
Maybe Turkey should be brought into the EU. It seems Europe needs some more pain before they come to their senses and do their own form of Brexit.
I hope Trump will fight against those terrorism !!!!! RIP to those victims
<b>&quot;We&#39;ll react terrorism with love and compassion ... nationalist are the real threat.&quot;</b><br>Angela Merkel.
akmed at it again. he should be on the guinness book of records for the most terror attacks caused the last 16 years.
islam just giving damage to us we must quit believe islam
don&#39;t worry people, good side is recruiting, we will eliminate the evil side
United States is playing again with Turkey :)
Death toll for 2017 from terrorist attacks is now 39. Don&#39;t worry folks this number will surely double, triple and quadrupole over the next year.
the ISIS stands for &#39;&#39; Independent Satanic Ideas State &#39;&#39;
Defund The UN
unfortunately ,every year  such kind of several terrors are occuring in Turkey.
So sad.....

Happy New Year!!!! From the religion of peace.
This time Santa&#39;s is Criminal they killed the Human being, take care of every Seasons for Santa&#39;s act now.
I knew New Years was the best time for them to attack
False flag
I saw the video the gun men did not look like they were wearing Santa suits.
Islam rings in the new year... with gunshots!
Only the awaken ones really know the deal..... America/England have been dropping bombs on middle east countries for years....... Why are america and england attacking countries who ARE NOT ATTACKING THEM???...... IN the mean time false flag events are made to install fear into the public so the public also think that Islam is to blame......... How about you sheep switch off your T.v and stop watching the bullshit media that feeds your brains bullshit....... You sheep are sad as fuk.... You literally live by what your T.v tells you......... Haaaaaa..........
Oh its just Islamophobia, nothing to see here.
orospu cocuklari bunlarin hepsi they are shit
Ronda Rousey lost a fight and now this. what next no kitty videos?
Islam in a nutshell. Expect to see more of this in Germany thanks to Merkel&#39;s policies.
I blame Australia
the sheer love of religion, be a far more peaceful world without its nonsense
USA=ISID
One of them was dressed as Santa? This doesn&#39;t sound like the usual Islamic terrorism at all. Anyone else get this impression?
Turkey deserves this attack.
in ur stupid coments i see hate ...but now we just need the word love!!! RIP TO ALL WHO DIED IN THIS ATTACK ..their parents are passing through hard times üò≠üò≠üò≠! 13 persons from my country lebanon they are young and beautiful they are arabs and they are victims!! so stop saying arabs are killing bcz most of the victims are arabs <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stopthehate">#stopthehate</a>
Very bed  happened
Religion of peace spreading Christmas joy again.
That&#39;s the way of true Islam.
next will be night club in france prepare
so many change of events , and the theories are still coming
Fake News, Erdogan false flag op!
Well that&#39;s not a good way to start the new year.
Turkey became the scene of constant violence after that Erdogan decided to change sides from backing ISIS in a US-Arab-EU alliance, into a Russian-Iranian new alliance.
it&#39;s funny really , you can say they are terrorists from Saudi,  Africa,  Yemen etc etc . but mention Islam. ....&quot;that&#39;s racist&quot;
Ban all nightclubs Clubs and celebrating new years is haram my brothers
Those darn Zoroastrians
The elite have succeded in creating an enemy for the next genocide. O how easy it is to control the masses!!
Omg üò± i was in that district with my family and we have celebrated without knowing it and i do receive this news now on my YouTube account <br>What a worldüò™
And they will damn deserve every bit of it !!! &gt;&gt; is-lame says = YOU&#39;RE VERY WELCOME !!!
Wonder if the attacker believed in islam and done this for allah , would be so surprised if that was the case ......
cowards - whoever hides behind a weapon
Way to start off the year.
We cant go a month without someone trying or successfully massacring innocent people.
sad
Say it with me - &quot;Islamic attack, Muslims attacked people in a nightclub&quot;, you can do it, I believe in you.
The buddhists are at it again
