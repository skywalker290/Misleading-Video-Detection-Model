Very professional
Wow ,🤎💯

If it was real that guy would have to be the dumbest guy on earth to stand that close hopping you to catch a foul ball with his teeth
Why did i get this reccomended
I wanna believe this is real
This should be called the blister machine
fake
The ball hits the exact same part on the net
I can barely hit where I want it to
He died of Ligma that’s why he hasn’t posted in almost 11 years -fake to
I wish my pitch back threw the ball half way to me
Hullo!
lmao fake 🤣
He’s trying to get more outs course shortstops are allways the best
Must be some tips of edit
Faaaaake
Those were some good routine plays for the shortstop
It’s cool but fake
This stuff is edited
Wow that’s unreal bro
The bat is probably dead by now
Ground outs to the ss lol okay
Fake
10/10 editing dude

I can’t believe I actually used to think this was real
Wow!
John 16:21<br>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
The eye coordination and speed is just perfect
fake news
Any baseball player knows that there is no way in hell he could have the stamina to hit it that quick and accurate that fast
fake fake fake fake fake I HATE FAKE VIDEOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pretty nice editing
Although someone might see my comment first I said it as a reply too but someone prove to me it’s fake there’s a comment saying it’s fake<br>Now I can tell: cuz there’s no way u hit the ball to short every time
u hit it like 14 times I counted the pitch didn’t count but if it did 16
This was good editing 10 years ago
I like the vid
Great video work.
Great video work.
Shortstop loves him
That is so fake
Nice editing 👍 Next time, maybe don’t make every hit the EXACT same sound
common man to make it 0.01% more believable u gotta make the bat have different hit sounds man
i was born on dtrdtrdthddtrdutrdrdrdrdudrd 73
I love how the bat made the same exact noise good editing though no troll
If this was real that would be crazy
Rly good editing for 10 years ago
I remember when I actually thought this was real
When u have practice but ur crush there:
That guy is insane!
This would be perfect to break in a composite bat if it was real
Soooo fake

Dude perfect
Notice how he’s standing on home plate
Fake
That is definitely fake
fake 2011 kind of stuff
fakest thing i’ve ever seen
Imagine that was real😂😂😂😂
Dang
I call crap
Don&#39;t love heading out to the field, on a sunny day. Just to practice lining out to shortstop
You can tell that that is fake
Is that fake or real
Ya right whe I saw the ball get hit to short, bouncing off the net, IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT on the net. Nice try trying to fool us.
Fake
I know this fake but that’s insane
WHAT DA FAWK
It’s fale
Bruh that editing was crazy
So amazing its almost as good as if someone edited it
Yeah
“Like there definitely is a shadow under the ball.”
Bull
That&#39;s a great drill for getting frustrated because you rolled over to short 50 times in 50 ab&#39;s
how

Forgot the ball shadows. Toss up vs re entry. Looks alright tho
wtf so fake
like you know it&#39;s fake, but it&#39;s still hella impressive
Why this felt longer than 54 seconds lol
THIS IS CGI
👍🏿
Isn&#39;t it amazing what editing can do these days, but beware you may be claimed to have been somewhere you never been  just by a click of a few buttons just like that baseball.
He coulda killed that little feller standing on the first base line.
Only question is, how do you stop?
🤯
Uuuuhhhh...Im not buying those nets/cages sorry. Cant fool this old doggie-dee dog
Came from 10 years ago website huhhh?
How do they edit it perfectly?
Meanwhile I can’t even hit the ball
Fake...you can tell by the ball shadow.
Fake
fake news
fake
Yo I gotta get that bat that makes the same noise every time
Talk about editing skills
Looks fake but cool.
Fake the ball hits the same spot ever time
no shadow
Hahaha so fake
CG....??😨
哈
Good batting!
The balls bounce was wired
How could he do these like maybe 80 mph fastballs and their were TWO baseball coming at him
😮😮😮
He’s also hitting it to the exact same spot on the bounce pad every single time. And the reactions are just crigne. I know im annoying for actually looking at this for more than a minute but idc
Def not fake. It looks so weird how the ball travels between the pads it just doesn’t look right
ill buy this for $200,0000 if its real
Just stare at the guy watching on the side the whole time he should have won an Emmy
That is so fake tho
Cap
this is so fake
Very dope
Awesome man😹😹😹
The horrible acting gives it away
John 3:16-21.
Fake the ball disappeared after he quit
It’s sad that it’s fake lol
Omg
cap
Sheesh that’s ultimate
this reeks of old early 2010s edited video. but good editing
10 years ago and it popped up in my recommended
If it was real what were you practicing
Impressive
It&#39;s in reverse
Bro the camera shake looks fake af
i feel bad for the idiots who thought this was real
How did he even do that
That was litgitness
“Yea wow that’s crazy no way oh man oh no way that was caaazy”
I miss the good old days when this was gold
Am I the only one that notices it’s fake
Cap
Sheeeeeeeee
This is real, look it up
Bro why are y’all saying it’s fake the nets move it’s timed perfect it’s real
Honestly his was so fake
This reminds me of those old fantasy football commercials
I remember watching this when I was a kid. 7 years later and it brought it back
No way
2021 gang ——&gt;
I gotta give you props for editing.
Wtf
How he do that
Working on roll overs to shortstop or what
Fake
FAKE!!!!!
Hello this has to be fake
Not sure if it is fake because the ball hits in a slightly different spot on the 3rd base net every hit
I know this is fake but do you think we could do this in real life
fake
Guys this is not real it’s 100% video shopped if that’s a thing
no way that is real
those angles are sooo off lmao
but ur working on hitting ground balls to short stop
Bro I don’t think that was editing
Insane editing but good video
Fake
Some people still believe it’s real and it’s funny
Don’t you guys just love how fake it is😂
Why is this on my recommended 9 years later
Wow the video was posted 10 years ago
I know it&#39;s fake but I wish I was that accurate with my hits
That’s so fake
So fakebut cool
He’s signed to the Marlins now
The editing is more impressive than the hitting
Fake
That&#39;s trick filming like the movies producers do it, nice try and acting though. The ball hit the net in the same exact spot every single time, absolutely impossible.😉
Good editing for 9 years ago. Also nice practice for hitting a line out to short
Real or fake?
That fake
Sooooooo fake
It is fake, their is a vid covering it
There is no possible way this is real
This is fake
Fake
I could never
SO FAKE look at his bat and the ball they never touch
Thoughs edits were u can see the ball edit are crazy
It’s fake he is swinging and he’s missing
Only if it were real
Is that fake or not
In the majors or on his way
So fake
No way!
Gayyy
Great video! Super talented.
And those are all outs.  How unamazing man.  Horrible job.  Keep up the bad work
Quality is amazing and the BP was amazing
HOWW DUDE THIS IS COOL
Nothing makes me more excited than pretending to be good at something.
Hes practicing aim, accuracy, and consistency
This is fake this guy is just good in editing
You can see it’s edited Bc it’s hitting the same spot on the net at the exact same speed
Gotta love the editing on this.
All the shots always hitting the same spot again and again 😆
Wow so real
The ball was a paid actor
HOW THE HECK
Ball hit same spot every time good edits other than that
How do you hit that consistent to the same spot over and over I don&#39;t get it.
FAKE AS FUCKKK
That was cool
Holy Crap
This is terrible practice. No coach would ever recommend this. You are teaching yourself to rush your swings and will only create bad habits/groundouts to short 😂.
This is edited
Yeah he’s whiffing every time but the ball is going
The guy screaming that was crazy is soo sus
9 years ago and best camera
<b>Conservation of energy has left the chat</b>
Fake as hell lol
Nice try photoshop
2020 we all know it’s fake
Noooo wayyyyyy
In 2011 we all thought it was real
This is real I want you guys to know that it’s really real
This is fake
Who else got this in there recommending after 9 years
Would have been a lot cooler if it was real
Nice balance at the plate, fake like the Bruce Lee nunchucks video
9 years ago
I was so sad when I figured out this was fake
Dude said “unreal” yeah, we know lol
Where tf the baseballs coming from
When I was 8 I was convinced this was real
gotta love how the balls don&#39;t lose any momentum at all, are they doing this in outer space?
his batting aim is so good
IST FAKEEE!!!
Omg. So Crazy
So how exactly is this guy not in the Dude perfect squad
2020 anyone
Is anyone gonna consider the fact that this could be fake?
Your on a soft ball Feild buddy
Ultimate editing practice
It is fake
INSANE
Anyone here 2020?
Fake
This video is fake, i can tell cause the ball lands in the same spot each time plus it looks a lot like cgi, which is what they were using to make this video!
Dis some good editing
WHAAAAAAT HOW!?!?!?!?!?!?
the edits are really good but not convincing enough
I legit feel bad for anybody who thinks this is real. You’re all clearly terrible batters with even worse eyesight. Anybody with a slight understanding of physics can figure out this is an incredibly well edited, bullshit video within 10 seconds.
el video es mas falso que tu novia se nota que todo esta echo a computadora y si no me crees entonces como explicas que una pelota de beisbol puede con tanta fuerza no tirar esas especie de redes no se caen si se nota que con tan solo un empujon se caen
july 2020?
Who came here from Captain Diss- I mean Mr Flare video 😂
gotta love some good 2011 edits
I want this to be an actual video <br>So sad this is a fake

What are the chances that a guys can hit a ball into the same part of the trampoline thing for more than 10 times. Also, he added and extra ball so he was hitting two balls into the exact same spot of all of the trampolines to get “the ultimate batting practice.” This is most likely fake
IT is fake
Perfect quality and looks fake
Great editing but u good of done better like it hit the exact same spot the whole time. Nice try tho
Why do they all hit the same spot though
Whoever was holding the camera was ignoring as hell cuz he chews gum too loud
Fake!! At the end they would have gotten hit by the ball
It’s fake and the ball is hitting the same place
So fake
Yezzer

“Unreal”
Even if this is real, how is swinging without a load gonna help you in a game. All he&#39;s doing is throwing the bat at the ball because it&#39;s so quick.
My only critique is they forgot to add a shadow for the balls...nice job though, very cool video.
This is so fake
Fake

No hate but this is fake the ball is in the same place every time nice vid
Wow that’s so crazy because when you hit it hits the exact same spot every time 👏

So fake, good editing, wondering when the balls will land, and the acting is terrible
The reason why it is fake because when he hits the ball it makes the same sound every time

It’s fake because the net that he hits the ball to gets hit in the same place every time and yes I’ve known for a long time this was fake
This is obviously fake
Proof that it’s fake the ball hits in the same spot
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8SK0rk5jdE&amp;t=46">0:46</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8SK0rk5jdE&amp;t=48">0:48</a> the balls go in the air and then disappear so it concludes that it is totally real
Fake cuz the balls always hitting at the same spot
Fake or not, it’s still cool!
That dude is a legend cool video
This is not real
Where did the balls go at the end

This is real, are you guys dumb. Look at how fast he&#39;s swinging that bat.. he&#39;s been trying to do this for months.
