good concept but bad acting
Fake
So this man swan in the water with a shark and then took a picture with a tornado and now he’s witness a selfie stick fight?
Gay acting gay english gay everyone, YT now more gay

If you can’t swim don’t start fights on boats 🤷‍♂️
Welcome to 2015(T_T)
The guy who went overboard looks like he weighs 320 pounds and the Japanese dude looks like he weighs 150 pounds 😂😂😂😂😂
一本　!!　🤣
gta 6 looks good right now
Faaaaaaaaake<br>These rich kids got everything in the world ... and yet they still need to fake excitement... <br>😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 what a bunch of losers
Fake
Okay second comment but this video is so under rated. Definitely deserves to be well over a million views by now! <br>I&#39;m even inspired to memorize this like a monologue 😂
If the fight was real this is 10 x funnier
3 stereotypes at once. Americans just running around like they rule the world, japanese kicking asses and brits behaving like everyone around them is just npcs
Wtf kinda GTA V fight is this 💀💀
Hii momma😂
Make more vlogs dude😢
Even if fake that&#39;s a good lift and throw !
This is so fake.
If you believe this is real, please get some help
English: Oi mate watch it...<br><br>Spanish: Oye tio cuidado...<br><br>Japanese: Sumimasen, kidzukimasendeshita<br><br>English (USA): Get the f*ck out of my way<br><br>Spanish (Mexico): Quitese a la v*rga compa<br><br><br>What? Y&#39;all thought there was only one with lack of manners?<br>As a matter of fact it happens to everyone, we all get easily pissed off sometimes and start a shitshow like this one that ends in karma for us.
what
fake or not, still a great video
Lol very well choreographed
Fake but funny.
damn he threw a bigger guy
It&#39;s some really good edits cause it&#39;s fake
🤣🤣
The Japanese guy won the battle, but not the war.  He couldn&#39;t swim, but the American wasn&#39;t finished yet.  The only way to win would be to drown him too...<br><br><b>Dives in after him</b>
Hahahaha funyyy
Lol why is this particular one age restricted? Didn’t know “boffer” was such a foul word 🤪
Bro, this austrilians are very funny

<b>Flashback WW2</b>
Aaaw... look at them play fighting. So cute. 😒
This is so stupid. Why would you hire actors to record stuff like this?
Judo :)))
Sigh people can’t even distinguish how this video is such a skit.
Non asian vs asian epic<br>What if Russian vs japan
Japanese people always fight. It&#39;s a natural phenomenon.
Japanese dude is a fucking legend. That american was acting like a f**ktart Go cool off buddy🤣🤣🤣he should have thrown that stupid screamin chick overboard too hahaha

Usa and Japan
The girl in the background crying is funny
I don’t even know what this accent is

fake
Is he a pom, a pom who&#39;s trying to sound Australian, or vise versa?<br> The whole thing is unconvincing from the start.
The asian guy was believable but the black hat guy was over-dramatic , gave it away

Anyone went through the comments to see people saying &quot;who came here because of Is It Real?&quot;
SO FAKE
That was so fake. First of all, the girl is exclaiming that he can&#39;t swim. But then if you watch the guy in the water, he&#39;s perfectly fine, just floating through the water. This was some of the fakest shit I&#39;ve ever seen.
so fake,with terrible acting.
FAKE

What&#39;s wrong with that guy? Someone accidentally hits him and he starts shouting like if this was world war II. Really, are more people like this in there? Because all of them deserve to be thrown into the water with sharks. Good Job Japan.

Well Boffa, you missed it.
Lol He overreacted.😂
Staged. But if you didnt do that man over board thing at the end you might have fooled us
The fact that the woman is screaming in the background &quot;He can&#39;t swim, he can&#39;t swim!&quot; when he is quite easily swimming out of the shot proves to me this is totally fake.
SO FAKE BOFFA
This made it on Right This Minute.
Needs more selfie stick fighting, otherwise it&#39;s just a staged dunking.
fake and staged...
Will movies made in selfie stick view, be worse than shaky cam view movies? That time travel movie could have been great if it wasnt for the shaky cam.
So fake, but still kind of funny.
how come you guys didn&#39;t add in a shark like last time.
inb4 this goes viral 
Fake and gay
Asian brutality.
xd
wow same *****
this is what really needs to happen, enough of the selfie stick craze, bring back angry old men with canes, maybe that could be your next video &quot;selfie stick hipsters VS angry old farts with canes&quot; and they all die at the end, fingers crossed
Australians are annoying af
hah
Do you guys reckon there&#39;s sharks in that water? 
Wow I&#39;m very early
