I wonder if he knows Red XIII...

Deep fake
I hope one day i have a cat just like jack.
Its ok i still like cats just thr way they are😊
The Kiffness needs to make a song about with this clip!!
The skinwalker posing as my cat be like:
I don’t believe the cat is making the noise, I think he is silent &amp; the guy is doing the noises.
The Barry White of cats imitating Joey Lawrence… Whoa!
This is clearly a joke...
Omg I love him! 😍 what a unique voice lol
From meowing to mewing

Autobots ROLL OUT
How real is this though?. It&#39;s that really the cat 🐈.

&quot;Gotham relies on me&quot; ass voice
It sounds like woah and wow that&#39;s crazy that a cat meows in a deep tone
&quot;His voice is a bit deeper than most cats...&quot;<br>&quot;Bow&quot;<br>&quot;Yes sir, sorry sir&quot;
Clearly fake as fuck soon as I heard it. It&#39;s obviously the guy doing it. Naturally everyone is gullible with their sheep brains believing everything. I&#39;d place money on this that it&#39;s fake I&#39;m so confident. It&#39;s not even remotely similar to a cats vocal range or tone even if it was deep. Straight up sounds like the guy in the video.
Cat sounds like valorant players when they hear a female voice
How awesome! Like hes saying wow, woah, yo....so many ways to use his meow for talming cat videos!
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MILDLY DEEP I CANT💀💀🤣
Guy: this is jack<br>Jack:wow.... How... Uhh

There is no way thats not a man it sounds so much like a dude
He is a sweetheart❤ and one of a kind
Damn i wish this was real so bad🤣
It sounds like the scene in the grinch when he starts up his sleigh 😂
A buddy of mine works for the USPS as a driver and as he was dropping off mail he heard a cat with a meow like this. He thought it was a guy imitating a cat.
😂😂😂😂

If Corpse was a cat:
This is fake
Fake.  <i>Some cats do suffer laryngeal paralysis, but a deep meow is not a known symptom of the disease. Dr. Jessica Vogelsang, a California-based veterinarian with expertise in small animals, told us: &quot;While certain medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism or masses can alter a cat&#39;s meow, I&#39;ve yet to see a cat who developed a deep and humanlike meow like this. Any change in a cat&#39;s meow is a good reason to visit the vet because the meow shouldn&#39;t change over time!&quot;</i>
*papa n mama doing their thing at bed<br><br>jack : &quot;wow.&quot;

CORPSE HUSBAND?
YouTube keeps reminding me to watch your video every now and then. How is your kitty now? ❤
Bro be mewing instead of meowing
=( why are the meows muted? Is it just me? The audio plays for the guy&#39;s voice but cuts before every meow. It&#39;s not my speakers
corpse husband cat???
whoa. whoa. whoa.
He’s black, has a deep voice and now we just gotta make him tall and force him to play basketball
It took me 10 seconds before realizing the dude wasn&#39;t the one wow&#39;ing
Jack rlly said &quot;MAOW&quot;
DOES ANYONE ELSE HEAR HOMER SIMPSON???
The swingers on jack are impressive for a cat.

Why does bro sound like most of my male classmates after they vape….
So many people think this real, easy views/money for this guy lol
&quot;Voice is a little deeper than most cats&quot;. <br><br>Nah man. That cat could voice Kratos.
Say Hi!!!!<br>NOOOOOO!!!

Imagine how deep his purring sounds! Lol
Jack is a cutie patootie
gigacat
That cat hit puberty lmao
&quot;woah&quot;

Years of catnip abuse to get that deep gravelly smokers cat voice 😅
Corpse better have this cat
Bros balls are in the underground
aint no way he %100 trapped a russian man inside of a cat
I suspect this jerk is using sulfur hexafluoride to deepen the cat’s voice
I think the thing isn&#39;t how deep it is, but how human it sounds. It sounds like it was edited, but it isn&#39;t.
This cat&#39;s voice is way lower than mine...
That’s lower than most human males
Get him on the MIC 😂😂😂
BOW
Bro thinks he&#39;s the main character of an action movie 💀.
“Say hi!”<br><b>”æú”</b>
You need a subwoofer to hear this thing.
That looks so much like my cats sister
This cat identifies as a cow
Man’s testosterone maxing
Average Russian cat:
this just broke my entire wall，how do we pronounce this meow？
Sounds like cow
I believe Jack is asking for chinese communist leader Mao Zedong to return. Jack is based.
LOL😅
That’s a black cat 🐈‍⬛
Me not being able to tell if that is actually the cat meow or if it&#39;s just edited in
I still have a hard time believing this is real, not just a voice over...
Owner: &quot;Can you say hi?&quot;<br>Jack: &quot;nO&quot;
100% a valorant player.
He’s perfect for morgen freeman
at first I thought this was edited 💀💀💀😭😭😭😭
No way. Lol.

HUSK!?!?!?!?!?
THATS CORPSE
Should have named him felix 😅
&quot;woah... Wow.... Woah... Aow... Oo..... WOW.&quot; -jack
I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s real...
“His voice is a little deeper than most cats’”<br>No shit 💀
I guess he isn&#39;t neutered 😂
