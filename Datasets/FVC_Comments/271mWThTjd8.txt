I still remember right when it happened <br>Was sitting at the college in the commons on my laptop with the tv on with the news going, on mute <br>Saw it breaking into the story so I went over and turned up the volume<br>Crazy stuff
I was faking sick so I didn&#39;t have to go to school this day. the first terror attack I ever got to actually experience myself.
You were there?
If you&#39;re going to record a disaster, at least be a good camera man..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=271mWThTjd8&amp;t=62">1:02</a> dang that is to close
Did you submit your video to the police to help with their investigation?
The lead up took just long enough for me to forget about the explosion. Terrifying.
The first bomb went off right when the guy in the wheelchair left the shot
Came here because of the movie...
There were 2 bombs at the finish line

Look at all these dickheads in the comments.
That&#39;s so sad. : (
I got accepted to the college Tsarnaev attended in Dartmouth Massachusetts. He was the most notable alumni according to Google. I&#39;m not going there.
My friend Ryan, his dad was in the marathon

I don&#39;t understand, why did Martin die? After all he did hold up a sign for a school project that says &quot;no more hurting people, peace and love&quot;. I hate some peopleðŸ˜§
The DETONATOR,Of The TRUCK BOMB,Is In &#39;PLAIN SIGHT&#39; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just saw myself in this video. I was there. Horrifying to relive.
at the 1 minute mark there are 2 muscleheads in white shirts rollingÂ <br>something or some1 to the bomb scene. these people are like the<br>badguys from a batmanÂ movie lol for realz. will some1 plz tell me what<br>they are doing? truthers b too smart :)
So sad ðŸ˜Ÿ
As I was watching this I started to focus on the announcer talking. As I was listening with my headphones I heard and huge bang. It literally made me jump. This is horrible.
D: no mames!! que pedoo me espanto la bombda pareciÃ³ o como que fue un verdadero un screamer
and she helps ur school no really she does she is super nice
ikr and thats why a women drouhot something didnt get first place and this year 2 place
I think you should disable the likes
watching this gets me pumped up, so epic
This is truly horrifying.  I was at the other end, the starting line, and didn&#39;t see the horror firsthand.  Thank you for posting this, it is important people know what was done.
Dats just disturbing forbthe marathon runners
Holy crap that was loud
Yep, my ears aren&#39;t working anymore. I jumped so much I almost woke up my fiancee.
rip headphones users
well deserved.
I couldn&#39;t see a thing
The seconds explosion must have been even scarier for the people, because they couldn&#39;t know whether there were more bombs. I would not have known where to go. Just horrible! Â 
Technomann44 that isn&#39;t nice. You would have done the same thing if u were this person. You wouldn&#39;t be trying to tape this u would be trying to get to a safe place.
wow your a crappy cameraman stand still if you wish to be apart of history 
I can see my blond haired daughter near the top of the grandstand as the flag clears the view and the bomb goes off. Second slater, she had broken he back and two arms.
She is about 1/3 of the way from the left.
tears 
This makes me feel the terror, panic and fear. Just hearing the screams, the crying... It&#39;s chilling. Tragic. :-/
astvac  im

holy shit, I think I saw the terrorists on 1:27
i went through every frame, this video must be like 20fm/s ... why are the guys(1:27) with the hoodie and goggles so calm? and watch out at 1:08( framewise) ,another guy in a hoodie sitting on the floor isn&#39;t moving at all , with his back on the wall ...  Rat Smells !
Wooooooooooooooooooooo loved it
Rip headset users
@SkynyrdLynyrdYaw are you actually a idiot? Don&#39;t you think that a huge event like that would have something called Bomb Squad there. There would&#39;ve been multiples stations around the course for paramedics, police, fire service &amp; specialist sectors.
Right at 1:01 on the very far left hand side of the screen, you will see a light similar to a laser beam flash right in front of the three wheel wheelchair and then the sound supposedly of the  pyrotechnics going off. One thing that exposes this as an hoax is only 30 seconds after the supposed explosion you&#39;ll hear sirens going off. There is no possible way to react in 30 seconds without it having been staged.
One of the girls at 1:16 has tight jeans on and a cut-off t-shirt and no number.
With all the security there, why are there so many unauthorized runners on the track?   At 1:16 we see at least one, probably 2 girls wearing no racing bib #.   Also, just before the first blast, we see 2 fat dudes pushing a baby stroller with a kid in it, all 3 have no bib either.
I hope everyone is ok that is a scary thing.
Real mature Tsarnevs, real mature
And I thought I was close to the bomb... I was at the Lenox across the street. I was almost in the blast because, not even ten minutes before my sister and I were trying to find a way to Sugar Heaven right next to where it happened. I&#39;m shaking right now. Hope everyone is okay.
how you gunna troll someones raw footage with what nearly every main stream entity is reporting and call it a lefty elephant
@michoeljk what the fuck does marijuana have anything to do with this?
For our sake, let&#39;s hope you never have to find out.
Omg, jumped of my bed with that loud BOOM.
No fuckn Waaaay this was a pressure cooker
@1:27 white hoodie and dark sunglasses hes very calm and doesnt run away he just stands there. he work for the CIA and he is in on this.
bomb blows at @1:00
0:34 announcer says last years marathon conditions were &quot;killing&quot;, pretty ironic
0:55
The runner in the orange shirt was my first warning on what was about to happen next.
*beep boop* my logic circus dictate that you are acting in an illogical manner. 
Fight or Flight would have weeded out some certain people today just as our ancestors went through...There&#39;s always a GEUBER in the crowd.
I would try to escape of course but I would&#39;ve kept my cool, I wouldn&#39;t be flailing my arms around screaming like a little bitch.
The terrorists proved that Americans are cowards.  At the very least I wouldn&#39;t have let them prove me one.
there all soo ugly as hell compared to robin meade!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How is it a sick joke, when the bomb never went off yet?  Unless he knew something was going to happen.
the guy says.. the &quot;conditions where killing&quot;.. wtf!?! what a sick joke
Hey ling chen...Quit spamming...wrong section.
Oh, Oh Mai, you are totally amazing. Did you watch this frame by frame. By the time 2:00 mark came up, I was totally nauseous. Didn&#39;t catch the woman pulling a nail out of her chest, but did catch someone wearing jeans with what looked like a nail sticking out of their butt. Nice catch!
I had my sound up too high and this scared the shit outta me. Cant begin to fathom the mindset if I were there.

Who liked this
that isnt true.
I dont unterstand why the people like this... 
:&#39;(
 STRAIGHT TO Alcatraz !!
You poor thing :(
At 1:27 the people in hoods that&#39;s not them,there was two people that did that one is died and the another one was caught
This is sad
All these people were super close to the bomb! I noticed the flags were in alphabetical order. The bomb went off right behind the Russian flag(Coincidence? I think not!). All these people were behind the USA flag.
There was a man and his gf was running the race and when she crossed the finish line he was gonna propose the a bomb went off and he found her dead. I feel like crying and may
Y would people do that.
Wow even if it is a terrible thing.  If history happens when u have a camera in your hand turn it off if your not gonna keep recording . People like this shouldn&#39;t carry cameras.
Ever notice how the left wants all the feeble minds?
also notice how those guys dont look surprised or shocked and arent even leaving and are a safe distance away but not to far away that he cant see
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ ÙƒØ¨Ø±
That is sad
holy shirrrrrrrr! 
Great camera work.
hell fuck all those people who did this!!

I was horrified by the brutal spectacle.
Listen to the announcer wth he talking bout the conditions being killing, weird huh
Those are the ones that I too thought looked way too calm. Point them out to the feds.
So sad :(
The video is acting suspicious as it will not rewind and pause like it would when first posted.

its not them the FBI released surveillance video of the suspests 
the man Art 1:27 look not really scared
@1:27, first 2 guys in light hooded sweatshirts and sunglasses ..then another directly by them in a cap and sunglasses...don&#39;t appear particularly phased by chaos unfolding around them.  ...captured 24 frames @1:27..very odd
Alaska
Damn you were so close to the blast
If you pause it at 2:00 just right, you can see a woman pulling a nail out of her chest. D:
I&#39;m doing it right now with the right and left arrow keys.  Is it just a Mac or Safari thing?
Gosh I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t there. Due to a phobia of loud noises I would have just stood there in shock and not gotten out of the way of any possible incoming danger.
1:28 theres a guy with sunglases a hat and a brown jacket. Too calm to be in that situation.
You have to be very fast at 1.26 on the pause button to get BOTH guys in the hoodies and sunglasses to show up. Jump the pause button here!

Wow, check out the TWO dudes both in grey hoodies and shades at 1.26-1.27.  appear together close up of faces.  Its a short image that is vivid. They show little emotion and are appear to try to be stealthy with the sunglasses and hoodies.
This is nothing against you because this is a good video, but this particular video made me want to throw up... just by what happened after the boom anyway! 

You did the right thing sending this to the authorities... it will help them find the sick bastards that did this! 
Why is it so pixelated
The 0:23 mark seems to line up with this picture I saw on reddit. If you search bostontimeseries and then choose race photos and the picture labeled 2:49 you can see what I am talking about. Youtube won&#39;t let me link to it. Nicholas, are you must be the guy holding the camera in the magenta hoodie then?
The ones catching my attention are on 1:26-1:27, an apparently very calm hooded trio wearing sunglasses. It might just be paranoia, but they seem too calm to be in the middle of confusion
This is the best footage of the explosion, it really makes you feel like you are there with the minute or so of normalcy before.
Youtube should have controls for slow-mo, frame/forward-back, and while we&#39;re at it double speed and skip/forward-back
Interesting - either it&#39;s just some homeless guy whose inebriation has slowed his reaction time - or perhaps it&#39;s somebody &quot;waiting&quot; for the next bomb to go off... 
video &#39;liked&#39; for utilising youtube for the sharing of news &amp; current events.
I just watched the video and jumped out of my chair when I heard the explosion.  
I hope like hell one day you have to face one of the victims of this and tell them to their face that this was staged.
So the explosion was to your right?  Looks like you ran toward it.  Is that correct?

I was going to post the question, &quot;are you stupid?&quot;, but no need too, being your stupidity and ignorance is very blatant. The guy had a bomb blow up near him and people were running for their lives and also aiding the injured. Video documentation of such an even is not necessarily on everyone&#39;s mind, but rather survivability and helping your fellow man\woman in need. #Derp
Crazy! You were so close =/ wow!
study the video frame by frame you can see people just standing there not giving a fuck as if nothing happened... holy shit if i was there i would run for my life!!
Are you serious ? That&#39;s not fictional , he is not superman and he ran for his life ( I think) . 
Why wouldn&#39;t you try to film what&#39;s going on? Why would you drop your camera to your side and let it bounce around?
My opinion is that you are as dumb as a bag of hammers.
FBI would&#39;ve already took all the videos off every site in my opinion.
The investigators need to talk to him.
&amp; edw. .... Excuse me but did you say that Bush kept it over there?    Hmmmm.... I thought 9/11 happened in New York
He was very clearly running, either towards where it happened to get a better grasp on the situation, or fleeing for his life. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to stick around and film for very long, either. This is a horrific event and you&#39;d run for your life as well.
Any particular reason you started wildly swinging the phone in various directions, rather than focusing on victims?  
why is that guy at 1:07 whit the hood just casually siting there like if nothing is happening 
If you go frame by frame look at around the 1:06-1:07 mark. There&#39;s a guy sitting there in a jacket, face covered.
I noticed him as well, is it just me or is he just standing there?  Looks like he&#39;s wearing a gray hoodie and dark sunglasses.  Can&#39;t really tell if he&#39;s walking away or just standing around.  Then again, he could be in shock.
Very Frightening video. Made my heart race. Glad you are ok being so close to the explosion.

What does the dude next to you say at 1:35? Does he say &quot;Obama&quot;?
Who the fuck is screaming??

Extremely disturbing and upsetting.  
that scared me and i knew what was coming would have hated to be there 
Explosion at 1:01.

R.I.P eardrums of earbud wearers. (turn your volume down!) 
He&#39;s probably just in shock and froze. I have no idea how I&#39;d react in his situation if I&#39;m honest.
The two guys in hoodies.. look like father &amp; son.... I mean the guy next to them is wearing sunglasses &amp; they probably all were just like what the hell is going on &amp; in shock... I think the coward/s would have either taken off right before the bomb went off so it wouldn&#39;t kill them or would be running away with the rest... so he/they are not noticed.
Yeah I noticed him to just chillin&#39;
Just hear that they&#39;re encouraging everyone who has any footage to send it in. Looks like you have done that. I hope your footage will help catch whoever did this.
Stop it

Thank god you aren&#39;t a cop
There are 2 guys one in white hoodie anothing in just a ball cap both with sunglasses both no emotion.
I completely agree. The first time through I thought that dude looked suspicious. When I stopped it on him he seemed way to calm and collected, he was just watching the madness. A split second later the video also showed a guy to his right doing the same, just sitting there. Also with the camera shake, did I see two guys in white or just the one.
I stop it at the same spot to The guy in the white hoodie does not look nervous at all! Im sure the PD stop on the same spot though.
So where was the explosion in relation to where the camera man was standing? 

good god that was loud! are you ears ok?
some people shut totally down in shock... with all the chaos, they might have just been looking around to see what to do... where to go... I often wear a hoodie &amp; sunglasses... 
hope nobody judges me to be a terrorist... 
I think they are regular people--I went through it frame by frame, and there is a clear view of them both. Look like father and son.
Anyone see those two guys at 1:27 mark? It goes by quick but if you stop it right you&#39;ll see them. They&#39;re just standing there and both have white hoodies and sunglasses on. Maybe it&#39;s nothing but it did catch my eye! 
Great advice. I have sent it to Boston PD, FBI, and AP. 
i was there too i was so scared i ran with my mom and dad after the bomb went off
