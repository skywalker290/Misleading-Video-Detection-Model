Fake news
Fucking warzone !   In  TURKEY  ! ? ? ?
Good move ordogan now the army is full loyalty to you
never seen so many human rats in one place
As an Anti-Erdoƒüan communist, i oppose the coup because it was done by the CIA to make sure that turkey wouldn&#39;t stray too far from its influence.
Be advised ac130 deployed
What would happen if there&#39;s a coup in Russia üòÇüòÇ
this is why in AMERICA WE HAVE GUNS ASWELL TO PROTECT OURSELFS TO BE SLAUGHTERED BY THE GOVERMENT!.
It&#39;s simple thing in a Islamic country
what a joke lmao
Fake coup by dictator erdogan
When does the second coup come .
Soldier is a dog
As a Turkish American, i can only say that, this was a controlled Coup , It was all pre planned with minimal casualties , so erdogan  can declares state of emergency and throw in jail whomever ever talked against him or may talk against him, <br><br>today. he is in one power. he has all department under his control. and taking  turkey to dictatorship.  i&#39;m sad to see it. but turks should wake up and realize this coup was done by him , to gain control fully.
Fuck America, fuck Europe, Fuck Isra√´l. Long live Russia, long live Turkey, long live China, long live Iran. Let&#39;s get the party started. Let&#39;s dance
This is what western &#39;&#39;democracy&#39;&#39; brings when other countries dont bend down..
Its all staged guys , at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RHdbRw6ZRE&amp;t=49">0:49</a> you can see stage manager sitting in chair , i bet whole special effects and camera crew is behind him...
this shit is fucked up
I as a Pakistani can&#39;t stop my tears. Our brothers had to see this all. You&#39;re BRAVEST Islamic nation. We are proud of you. You gave me the courage to lay before a tank if west tried to invade my country.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RHdbRw6ZRE&amp;t=114">1:54</a> what is this?
what a shame coup was not succesful... people don&#39;t know what is good for them
what is a car bomb good for  in an ongoing coup?
What game is this
Those two dude at the bottom of the screen on the second blast. Dude. They got a story to tell.
&quot;Turkey is of the Turks&quot;, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, 1919.
&quot;CCTV footage compilation&quot;!  Baaaaahaaaa!
god blessed the brave heart of turkey. that was some scary shit right there
Whats this on sky at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RHdbRw6ZRE&amp;t=98">1:38</a> ?
stupid comments from stupid haters the fucking traitors shoot on police forces and on civilians too bcz they stopped their poorly plans of ur and their masters of the failed coup
I am not interested in politics, although times in Europe and in the World are strange, bloody and turbulent. What is the goal of killing usual civilians instead of removing leaders of the country? Is Turkey going to islamization or to modern country direction? Why and how can destroy their own country - ppl and materia things, cars, buildings etc.? I can&#39;t understand it.
brave move by civilians against army
Don&#39;t worry Erdogan is in charge and now wer  dealing with all the pussies of those cowards.
this is the worst  Planned coup by CIA
varo≈ülar istediƒüiniz kadar g√∂t√ºn√ºz√º yƒ±rtƒ±n Erdogan is here, siktirin gidin ≈üimdi aq ameleler :)
BENDING DEMOCRACY HITLER-STYLE
That ending graphics&#39; sound gets me every time. Damn you RT!
The second tank seemed careful not to hit any civilians while the girst one jst drove over them. 
Staged
so sad the era of kemalism is completely done either it was a staged hoax or not.
fuk u amerika,fuk u europa,fuk u israel
drop a nuke already god
minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RHdbRw6ZRE&amp;t=66">1:06</a> bomb lands straight on that guys forehead
Theirs been a massive explosion that has rocked and shaken the buildings and the crowd is still gathering, one wonders if their actually making a stunt movie or if our Turks just seem very peculiar.
when was the last time a coup targeted the civilians? They supposed to seized the key governmental buildings which they failed miserably as if Erdogan security forces knew what&#39;s coming!
the first bombs are loyalists strikes
I wonder whose car that was ? Ex wife of pilot or  dummy target?
let them start a flu to kill hundreds and thousands of civilians in Turkey so then they will be able to take over turkey or they could just make a zombie apocalypse whichever one you want to do but I still hope the military of turkey wins
Fuck of all secularists here! Viva! Long live Erdogan!!!!!!
Roasting Turkey with Erdogan spices and stuffing will be a good dinner to ponder if you are hungry.

Erdogan and his &quot;Democracy&quot; . Fckin pigmey
people on the streets unarmed are military targets... I don&#39;t think so this is more like a body count mission to blame the &quot;rebels&quot;.  Retarded dictator president simply giving an excuse to genocide the opposition. The next home for ISIL turkey and they&#39;ll have nuclear arms to attack Russia and Europe too.. the the UN will mop up and look the NWO UN rules the world.
Seems like a good opportunity for some political opposition slamming...
Guys climb on tank. Last clip man is yelling at something... Tank flies by with a bunch of guys on the back. LoL <br><br>Nice story wrap up.
Why were they attacking civilians? It further proves that this coup was fake, there weren&#39;t any military personnel but parked cars and civilians.
Buy so many foreign weapons to attack themselves
Grand Theft Auto in real life.
Who stands in front of a fucking tank? How stupid can one be?
The turkish people dont understand that they fucked up their own country, these people were their last hope
Where the hell where they shooting at?!
Civil War !!! Civil War !! Civil War!!!
what Bollox this was orchestrated by Erdogan himself to crush all of his opposition . you&#39;ve got to be a Moron to think the military were so badly organised and gave up so quickly . If it was genuine those reported F16&#39;s that had their missiles trained on his plane would have blown the Cunt out of the sky
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN bombing his own people; of course: (The unknown interesting true story is that while the PURGE by Erdogan was underway TWO US F-16 fighter jets locked onto Erdogan`s Presidential plane: The RUSSIANS knew this assassination would take place so they SHUT DOWN electronically the entire Turkish//US military including INCIRLIK NATO airbase and sent in 40 Russian fighter jets that LOCKED onto the TWO F-16`s; so the assassination ordered by Obama//CIA was called off: President Putin SAVED ERDOGAN¬¥S life:)
The coordination of this coup was ignominious.
Airstrikes or Carbombs?
I don&#39;t understand, what were the targets of bombing?
Give &#39;em hell Mr Erdogan!
This is disappointing Alex. I didnt really agree with u on the supporting of Trump, but i considered u to be a better person, because u didnt resort to violence. Although u were &quot;forced&quot; to fight, I think you probably shouldnt have.
I dont think they were planning on winning. <br>I think most likely, they wanted to show Erdowan for the real person he is. <br>And now hes arresting everyone, and severely censoring free Speech. <br>Hes going full on Dictator mode.
fuck it kill em all
Those tanks are Leopard 1&#39;s - how did the stinking Turks get hold of German tanks ?
it was all plan by the fuckin president so that he can continue his support for IS
Rest in peace <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RHdbRw6ZRE&amp;t=68">1:08</a>
Hope theres a 2nd coup, but maybe more succesful
interseting everyone thinks erdogan staged this. I think maybe those he thought were his friends actually are not. ü§î that letter to Russia about the su24 being shot down. Wonder whats happend to the pilot who shot it dwn part of the coup no doubt üòí
Those blasts looked like from a Star Wars movie!  A big ray and boom!!  It was kind of cool looking.  Makes me think this could happen here.
Looks Fake
Exactly why it&#39;s a stupid idea to try and block a tanks path.
oh shit that was to dam close !!!!! :o
God bless turks and Turkey finally it&#39;s over

turkey is cool i wished i was turkish..

Did I just see a man get blown to pieces? :(
Russia should invade Turkey and take out the tyrant Erdoghead and bring freedom and peace and democracy and secularism back to that country.
when this happend?
Those poor people
come on this is bullshit <br>what kind of coup the military shots to parked cars , and avoid civilian casualties ? only a fake coup does that
Next battlefield game should be in turkey, so much material  lol
I&#39;m confused with what&#39;s going on in turkey.. Like what is it turkey Government vs who or what..
Looks like civilians cruising around in a Tank at about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RHdbRw6ZRE&amp;t=160">2:40</a>? Damn Joyriders, like GTA. Apparently a bunch of the Military thought they were only performing exercises / drills?
Wooow cool stuff üòé
are they using some sort of Lazer around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RHdbRw6ZRE&amp;t=110">1:50</a> mark??
You mean the fake coup that Erdogan staged? Yeah...whatever
