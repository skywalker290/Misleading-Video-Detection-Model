This is nyc. We keep our heads down and mind our business. Like everyone should do

Nobody help welcome to modern world..
Employee at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9kfJUQnawU&amp;t=38">0:38</a> better have been fired. Person who recorded and uploaded this better be unable to walk and speak. Otherwise, just as bad or worse.

Hello, I am a reporter at the Press Association, a UK news agency. Would you mind emailing me at catherine.wyatt@pressassociation.com - I would like to ask you a few questions about this vid! Thanks :)
Description needs to be changed: Woman&#39;s head is stuck between train doors and train riders just stare without care while I, also without care, record her plight to post on social media.
gotta love new york...not
skip to 0.37 for the best part<br>lmao
I can&#39;t see how people fall in the gap but this is classic
I hope they are ok now. 🙏👍
