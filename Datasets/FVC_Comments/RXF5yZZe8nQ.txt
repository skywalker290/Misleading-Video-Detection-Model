I work with the company that does those evacuation slides.  Good to see it saved people.
Damn that&#39;s crazy
People made sure to get their carry on luggage from the overhead compartment before they got off, and they didn&#39;t know if the plane was going to blow up or not. If it did, their families would have wanted to sue the airlines for not getting the passengers off the plane fast enough
This is an old video from two years ago....look up Chicago plane fire
