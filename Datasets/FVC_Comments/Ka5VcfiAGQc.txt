Click bait‚Ä¶you win this round. Thanks for nothing.
People need to stop creating false narratives that animals like bears, orcas, pandas, hippos, walruses are cute.  These animals are at or near the top of their food chain.  They dont go hunting and looking for their food.  They let their prey come to them.  They are animals and their life is dependant on their natural survival instincts, hunger, and threat detections.  If you are one or all of these things, you risk getting killed ar any given time.

It&#39;s a joke that we try to control these majestic beasts and very sad that we try to do it.
SCAM FRAUD
fuckyouand your clickbait bullshit , are you THAT desperate ?
Not to seem bloodthirsty, but where&#39;s the whale killing the trainer int eh video?  And ever moreso- what a horrible choice of music.

Unser Sch√∂pfer hat uns menschen und so wunderbare Tiere erschaffen . aber sicher nicht daf√ºr das menschen sich das recht  herausnehmen diese tiere einzusperren und zu Qu√§len. üò¢
‚ÄúBased on my personal experience with whales and dolphins in the wild and my observations of these magnificent animals in captivity, I believe there is no justification for allowing them to be used as performers in theme park shows and that breeding them in captivity to sustain a captive population solely for entertainment and profit is unacceptable. The concept of watching cetaceans perform tricks in theme parks is anti educational and is inhumane. These are animals that live in family pods for their whole lives with life spans similar to our own. Capturing whales and dolphins for entertainment and profit forces them to live in artificial families, in spaces that are insufficient, and rewards them with food for doing tricks they do not do in the wild.<br><br>Today, we have the interactive film and video technology to show cetaceans in the wild to audiences around the world. For the amount of money a family spends to go to an animal park, they can have an on the water experience seeing whales in their natural environment. It is long past due for us as a thinking and caring human species to adopt and require practices that respect whales and respect their right to live in their natural wild environment.<br><br>Anywhere on the planet we are connected to the ocean. We have the opportunity to do what needs to be done to protect our life support system and improve the quality of life not just of the marine environment ‚Äì of the marine mammals -- but for ourselves. This is the choice we have. If we protect the ocean, we protect ourselves.&quot; <br><br>~ Jean-Michel Cousteau<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s about as much educational benefit studying dolphins [and whales] in captivity as there would be studying mankind by only observing prisoners held in solitary.&quot; <br><br>~ Jacques Cousteau<br><br>&quot;Whales and dolphins, like chimpanzees, are highly intelligent and intensely social creatures, forming close emotional bonds between family and group members. I have watched them leap in the freedom of the ocean and feel deeply saddened and angered to see them in cruel captivity, swimming endlessly and hopelessly around their sterile concrete prisons. As David Kirby so eloquently documents in this timely work, whale and dolphin captivity only benefits the captors.

Stop going to these shows u idiots<br>Stop torturing innocent animals
Shame never did that. LOL
The song is making this so much sadder
And to think they still do these shows
Been noticing a lot of false titles on you tube lately, here watch this video that has absolutely nothing on it.

Lying
Clickbait piece of shit
SHIT...MUSIC TO KILL BY   PATHETIC
This is the incident that ended the Pelican as an Orca trainer program.
She abuse the animal that orca don&#39;t deserve this!
Nothing happened!
Clickbait. don&#39;t bother watching
every day that an orca kills a human is a good day and we are closer to doing justice to these amazing creatures for having stolen them from the sea
Dam
That title is so misleading. No trainer killed. Just another boring animal abuse show at Sea World. Very disappointing.

damn 13 year
This video sucks, no one dies in it. üëé
Wait, I saw a whole video and as far as I know, it was not the trainer, but a pelican! The bird sat down on the water, while one of the orcas succesfully ambushed it and roamed around the pool with it&#39;s corpse in it&#39;s mouth. The guts also belong to the pelican, as you might guess.
I‚Äôm on shamos side
Nobody even gets attacked in this
The whale is traumatized every day of their life in a &quot;bathroom sized area&quot; where they live and they have to perform these stupid tricks which is not normal for a whale in order to be fed.  You people who go see these &quot;shows&quot; are part of their abuse. Stop going and they&#39;ll shut them down and then the whales and dolphins can live in their natural habitat.  DON&#39;T YOU CARE?
People may see this as, ‚Äúinnocent trainer gets attacked by killer whale.‚Äù Well, I see this as, ‚ÄúInnocent killer whale attacks a killer human.‚Äù Because SeaWorld killed 40 orcas, and continue to do this to these animals. Free the orcas already!
Not even the real attack that killed trainer. This attack was at Florida and He lived, Thank God!!
Damn.....Thats one minute and a half im never getting back in life
Song says YOU ARE MY FRIEND
Orcas were never meant to be kept in captivity especially if they are old and too big to be caught in the first place
all i saw was someone swimming ._.
You idiot
Imagine making money off clickbait/lies and YouTube is okay with it. But when conservatives speak out about corruption, they get banned and silenced.
Report fake video then blacklist
Stupid people they ruined ewrything on this Planet orcas DONT belong to Swimmingpool ü§¢
Clickbait piece of shit
Wtf???
* hello guyssss*
Im confuse
There are just two orcas that were confirmed to kill humans, both in captivity, named Tilikum (3 ‚ò†Ô∏è) and Keto (1 ‚ò†Ô∏è)
Spending time....
Good job shamu. You do what all animals do. Kill what endangers you. Your sufferings opened our eyes. We will never forget you.
Yes sir yes sir yes sir yes sir yes sir this is what I needed
well done killer whale
R.I.P
Don&#39;t blame orcas, sharks they get tiny food, horrible loud music in there ear and forced to do stupid tricks medieval whether born in captivity or taken stolen from sea, taken stolen from mum some were as a baby and then you force a traumatic lonely creature to please you and because of greed and no kindness <br>Control freaks, these creatures are intelligent and aware you are taking advantage of them and they know what you have done, the shows are ancient <br>( release to sanctuary)yo are disrespecting them without self awareness that they belong in the sea, they are not your family,  there family is in the sea, they are not yours
Dumb video.  Dumb music

This video was cut, and the killer whale doesn&#39;t kill a trainer it kills a live pelican. The full video is up on YouTube and you&#39;ll be able to see that what he was doing is taking out the remains of the pelican because the whles didn&#39;t eat it all, and just left parts of the pelican in the water

Is shamu still alive
this is close to ear rape

This was a good 1 min waste of my time I could have been playing with my cat oh btw I went to sea world if anyone cares
The Orcas did not kill anyone it was a pelican. Also, this happened I believe in 2006. Although, in 2010 they did get another pelican.
Too scary

This is the most dumbest shit video I&#39;ve ever seen this shit isn&#39;t even about shamu killing the fucking trainer get a job and get your fuckin vids straight you dam lunitic
Click bait!!!!!!!!
Fake
Everyone. A Trainer did Die though. They didn&#39;t get it on Camera. because all of the Trained Whales are Trained by Touch and Sense, Shamu didn&#39;t know that Hair Sense. One of the Trainers didn&#39;t have their hair up and Shamu thought Hair was a Threat so he Ate his Trainer
I&#39;ve seen the real video it just killed a bird
me either
thats shamu way of say fuck you
everybody go look at shamu kills pelican
the placement of this song in video is awesome... this song is meant to be whale... it&#39;s not love song! MICHAEL JACKSON is the one who wrote this song to save whale from hunting.
Fuck Sea world. End it.Legally end sea world.
he/she is just wanting views his lying
The trainer didn&#39;t die......stop lying.
we have been trolled
This is not a video of trainer being killed. This is video of when shamu attacked and ate a bird that was sitting on the water during a show.
This is from another video of a killer whale eating a pelican at the show!

Awwwww Michael!!!!!
<br>
How the ruck was he killed
The whale only killed a pelican in this video
This was the song from Free Willy
Animal ha gayyy
All documents of the killings on video were destroyed. They even had one video of where tilikum lunged at a trainer and the canera guy was ordered to destroy the tape. Even tho no one. Got killed and he even edited it out they still said the tape was unusuable. Sea world gets rid of the vide evidence before it can be seen.
That&#39;s a pelican the whales killed cause I watched the video
you piece of shit,dont upload shit if you dont have the real footage
there&#39;s no likes and dislikes this was from 2010!
This is when Shamu killed the Pelican, ¬†not the trainer. People and the trainers would freaking out more if he did kill the trainer
I say the same as many others. There was never in this video that Shamu killed its trainer. Maybe he did it, but not in this video.
Is this real?
Shut down sea world
He DIDINT kill him idiot 
He doesn&#39;t die idiot
Its a pelican and Tom the trainer is getting the rest of the Pelican they tore apart..
This is when they killed a pelican .
Is there any real vids of shamu killing his trainer cause im pist
Stupid fuck head go to hell your a complete piece of shit 
completely contrived video
Shamu didnt kill annyone
Shamu as well as other captive orcas HAVE killed their trainers in the past. This is because ORCAS DO NOT BELONG IN CAPTIVITY. THEY ARE PREDATORS AND YOU ARE TAKING AWAY THEIR ABILITY TO HUNT!
Just because it says &quot;killer whale&quot; it doesn&#39;t mean it kills humans it&#39;s a lie this video and all of the videos about killing the trainer is fake so flag this video
its not fake but seriously THEY ARE (KILLER) WHALE. YOU DONT GO SWIMMING W THEM! 
Nothing happened
Sucked in i say and its their own fuckin fault! I wish more shit like this happens!!! Then the so called experts here are saying the animal could&#39;ve been agitated blah blah fucking blah! Get that fuckwit and put him in a box for all his life to do tricks for a bunch of fuckwits everyday and see how he goes! Fuckin idiots!
If you want to watch the real video&#39;s, watch Blackfish (2013) The trainer that was feeding the Whale does actually get eaten.
me too
Life is too short to have our time wasted by stupid people
Same here. Sick and tired of misleading titles that are nothing more then a waste of my precious time...
yea well i to but apperantly youtube doesnt care about its clients

dafaq is ur prob\


flagged for spam
Actually,the guy trainer in this video is taking a dead bird out of the pool,the whale killed the bird,not the trainer.That happened to someone different so if your going to do this,at least get the right trainer in the video.
Stupid Video and also the Idiot who made this Video. 
fu#kthis video
1 They BELONG in the SEA

Itsafucking pelican u moron
lmfao so true
no one died stupid vid

It&#39;s sir. You don&#39;t know much if you think they just live in that &quot;tiny&quot; glass box all their lives. They&#39;re able to move to different areas within the park, depending what aquarium they&#39;re from. You also ignored my point completely. They&#39;ll DIE if they are released into the wild. I&#39;m done trying to make my point again. There&#39;s not even any point in arguing with you anymore.
Reported and you should do the same - click the flag below the number of views
you can report it .. and I highly recommend it :) .

Report this video for a misleading title.
Report for misleading, the caption is intentionally wrong
shhhh.... its trying to communicate
Ugh that&#39;s clearly just extra food for the whales or else why is no one panicking
these handlers clearly care about these  amazing creatures.But thats where they get it wrong.Killer whales are intelligent sea predators that  should be treated  with due respect and should be free from captivity.
serves them right these beautiful creatures belong in the sea not a fish bowl for humane entertainment 
you can flag it &quot;Report&quot; for being &quot;Spam or misleading&quot;

I just did.
It was a pelican.  One of the orcas took a pelican floating in  their pool down,
it came up in pieces. This occurred in San Diego just days before the human fatality
in Florida.
Takes an idiot to know one! &quot;Raised&quot; imprisioned against their Will &quot;have Happy lives&quot; living in a see through tiny box? Animals are not abused &amp; these prisions &quot;educates us on what not to do in order to survive these situations&quot; You IGNORANT MORON how many humans spend most of their time out in the Ocean! They survive in their habitat but removed for decades of course they&#39;ll forget the basics point is LEAVE THEM ALONE FREEDOM oh My Grammar? How about FUCK YOU for your assumptions Regards Miss
Sir, or should I say &quot;idiot&quot; . . . If these animals were released into the natural habitat, they&#39;d most likely die due to not having survival skills. They were raised to have happy lives and entertain (and humans don&#39;t treat these animals like shit just for money . . . they treat and respect them as if they were their own child). Also, it&#39;s human nature and curiosity to see these types of videos . . . It educates us on what not to do in order to survive these situations.
Also... Grammar, please.
Rubbish, I want my 1.32 mins back!!

@barshkin I doubt your in a position to talk. Because the fact that you could point that out, meant that you infact... Watched it!
This is Normkangaroo&#39;s video, which was posted back in March of 2008.

To everyone: The killer whales killed and ate a pelican.
@barshkin 

Whats also funny is that you clicked on this video yourself..... WHAT A HYPOCRITE!!!!
...
some people must be stupid. If theres the word killer in it then it will kill.
The title should be whale gang bang
@barshkin well you watched it didnt you ?

What&#39;s Up With The Music?
@barshkin i dont give a shit about your reason for the title. i just hate fucking liars. fuck you

R.I.P MJ and Dawn Brancheau
@barshkin Nothing, it&#39;s natural morbid fascination.
i remember i watched this whole thing five times to see the trainer die and i was 4 i was like FWUCK THWIS SHWIT BWITCH
This video is NOT from when Tilikum attacked the trainer, it is from another Sea World performance when one of the whales attacked a pelican. And furthermore, you cannot blame a whale for attacking a human, it is being an animal of it&#39;s own nature. It&#39;s instinct is that a human is getting in it&#39;s tank, invading it&#39;s space and posing a threat, and it needs to defend itself. That is what the  trainer&#39;s family and friends have continued to say, and insisted that she would have said, since her death
what a load of whale shit
shamu killed a pelican that landed on the water. there is another video on here that is like 9 mins long that shows the Orca grab the pilcan and 2 or 3 other whales take it under, drown it, then bring it back up and rip it to shreds 
who got killed noone

what i find funny is how more than 4.5 million people have viewed something with a title like this......WHATS WRONG WITH US, WORLD????
shit video

This is a video segment from a longer video shot by Normkangaroo where during a show the killer whales attack a pelican the trainers are cleaning up the pelican not a person
yea, you&#39;re supposed to show the trainer getting killed if you&#39;re gonna put up a title like that...
thAT WAS AN ABSELOUTE COOOOOOOOOOOOOONNN WHAT A WASTE OF MY STUDY BRAKE
just wondering.. but what happened to the whale? is it still in sea world? relase it?
killed it??? :(

Everyone willÔªø forget you. start posting. the time will start as soon as you finish reading this. yesÔªø I do hate these comments
poor
are u kiddin me? 80% of this video is some random dude swimming o.o
This is video of an incedent where the killer whales attacked and killed a pelican. Not a person. You see one of the trainers run off with the wing. 
@151megz I know what your getting at but sadly alot of people couldnt care less if they killed a beautiful specimen like this orca. Even tho there are charities set up they need soooo much money for it to have an effect on most orca&#39;s. I wish the orca&#39;s could roam freely but the world isnt full of loving and caring people you always get a heartless person who does cruel things for cash.
@willbeanz1 its cruel. Sadly all animals are at risk of hunters ect... but it would be a lot better if people actually cared about the well being of these whales and gave money to charitys that takes care of them while they are in their natural habitats. The Whales at seaworld are not free and although they may seem happy, they are not. Whales wernt brought in this world to be held captive.
@dianamp312 I can see your point and i know they would rather be free but people are still going out with harpoons and ending there lives for money. Its sad that its come to this but i think they are safer and more cared for in captive than out in the wild.
umm thats not a human thats a pelican that was in the rong place at the rong time T_T and yes i saw the real vid of this &gt;_&gt; and its not this made up crap about one of the orcas killing their trainer!
@123infomaniac  actaually it is not cruelty I was lucky enough to see the behind the scenes and quite frankly they get todo what ever they want! Before the show starts the whales are not forced to do anything they get trained and if they dont want to do it then they cant make them, overall after the show has finished they get put in a ginormous tank filled with fish and other specimens it is not cruelty
yea...that wasn&#39;t a trainer that was a bird...but hey by saying that you got alot of views..that was your motive right? ;) 
idiots...
@TheFizzGirls I&#39;m not sure anything I said could possibly pass for ignorance. On the contrary, I was using common knowledge and fact to point out your ignorance. And it thoroughly amuses me to see you get so irritated and upset by it, too. I don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re trying to argue here, you seem pissed that I retaliated to your own ignorant, humdrum statement and, since you don&#39;t have the I.Q to deny it, you just sorta&#39; idle. Btw, i&#39;m expecting a &quot;your momma&quot; joke as your next response :D
Hey come see my Videos on my channel for hunting target practice and more!! =)
@TheFizzGirls I&#39;m sorry, I wasn&#39;t able to find leg for you to stand on via my google search.
umm...yea. this is a video of a pelican. not the trainer. 

@TheFizzGirls It was no mistake. Killer Whales are the deadliest and most violent creature in the ocean, including great white sharks. They&#39;re cannibalstic, they&#39;ve got a vicious mean streak, AND they&#39;re highly intelligent. They know when they&#39;re beat, and they know when they&#39;re not.
I&#39;m not saying what the whale did was wrong, I was cheering on the beast the whole time! I&#39;m just saying don&#39;t fool yourself.
And by the way, Killer whales arn&#39;t whales. They&#39;re actually dolphins. Look it up.
The whale killed a bird not some trainer in this video....
@123infomaniac omg so true id feel the same way!
@Rarogne1926 So true! 
can i have 1 mintute and 30 seconds of my life back???
Lol the upload date is feb 4 2010, and the thing says the artist is micheal jackson, and that hes playing aug 11, 2011, but he died 4 months after the video uploaded :X R.I.P. Michael
fake video , Michael Jackson !!&lt;3 R.I.P
Where is the death? ass!
In my opinion, the killer whale attacked the trainers at Sea World was because of where they were trained. It may seem like a huge tank to us, but it&#39;s a dungeon for these whales. They should be swimming freely in the oceans and not being trained here.:O
I WANT ONE!!!!!!!!!!
wow southpark does have some real things in it... it probably just wants to go back to the moon
@OnversePlayer its not even human remaains its bird remains from a pelican shamu killed in the show beforehand
@Sharkoes I would be pretty unhappy to be in a little fish bowl with that size...if they build them a big and i mean BIG lake...yeah, but thats a fishbowl with no natural things inside....not fair.
i agree with letting them go but ask yourself do they look sad? tricks for food that they would have to work harder for in the wild sounds like a fair trade to me many of these whales would probably die out of captivity being that most are probably born there 
LET THEM CREATURES GO, lord, one day a creature will catch trainers and turn em into slaves just because of that. And, no one was seen killed in the video, what is the point of even making it if there&#39;s not going to be shown of what is said. &gt;_&lt;
trollin......
 good one Mr.nodartribute. bravo.
lmfaoo wtf &gt;:l 
whereess da killer whale !
Trollin
 WTF is is this shit!
@flipultarhd iwas i bet a great white shark came after that video
wow that was rlly stupid all i saw was a guy swim back and forth i mean wtf was that?

wth??? all i saw was a trainer swim back and forth and a freakin dead pelican.
@flipultarhd To the contrary, both the whales and the people seem to be having a blast.
thanks i read the comments FIRST!
fuck yeah free willy music
@Smilies85 The trainers at Seaworld treat the whales as if they are priceless gems. They protect them, feed them, and love them. If you are too stupid too realize this then just shut up. You shouldn&#39;t be talking about something you know NOTHING about. I was once a Orca trainer myself and the people there would never hurt an animal. And yes there is room to swim, if you think its a Swimming pool with no room to move around you obviously haven&#39;t been to Seaworld at all!!!
@Smilies85 Unless you&#39;ve worked there, are a marine biologist, a trainer, or have any REAL education on the matter other than your tree-hugging &#39;save the whales&#39; act, you need to back off and not talk about things you don&#39;t understand. My sister was an orca trainer, and those animals are treated amazingly. For us to understand our world, we need to research. So BACK OFF. 
Shitty swimming pool? Are you stupid? You&#39;ll find yourself a shitty swimming pool at the dollar store. This TANK holds more than about 5 million gallons of salt water. Wow ur really a dumb ass.
lol i thought shampoo was a shark
@flipultarhd thumbs up if you&#39;re a complete psychopath and enjoy watching videos of people dying gruesome deaths.
you suk !
Did they kill Shamu for killing the girl?
@ChelseaJHebert to be conpletely honest, the movie was really boring too. haha ;) I ended up changing the chanel. Then turning off the TV, then I watched youtube for like 30 mins, then I shut off my computer, then I started a new book. It was a nice sunday. So yes it was my fault, however, it does get a little annoying when people put false things on youtube to just get views. but ehhh idc, it&#39;s not like I couldn&#39;t just rewind, the movie just wasn&#39;t good enough, but the book that i read was ;)
@ciciironwill27 Why are you watching YouTube if you&#39;re watching a movie...? Isn&#39;t that kind of your own fault?
ok... ive spent like 2 hours searching the video of the trainer&#39;s death and now i feel awful :( what the hell do i care of how she died! i feel so insensitive and useless i was supposed to be studying for an examination and now i think im going to have nightmares about whales =( ive better find out what to do with my time =( RIP. 
@goldhalo12 what about the time u wasted typing that message, or even thinkin of it? just go with 2 mins of ur life =)
I was watching Aliens 3 on BBC. and bc of this video I just missed some guy getting eaten....Now i&#39;m pissed! 
i have rid shamu before
ROFL I seen this video more then once on tv, it just goes after a pelican that lands. it is funny actually,
flag this shit for SPAM&gt;Misleading text
thats a freakin palicans guts i saw the orginal footage
he disabled the thumbs up/down buttons.
Thumb this up, to thumb the video down.

@rhinolimits21 look person they save these wales if the relase them now they wont survive n another thin the relese whales they relese the 1ns tat accut. have a chance out there so get ur fact stright ok tnkz
this is the vid wen they kill a pelican not a trainer so people dnt watch this after the first 5 sec. i could already c wat it is so tats 4 nothing

@flipultarhd thumbs up if you think this guy is an attention seeking norm trying to get the highest rated comment
DOESNT ANYONE HAV THE ACTUAL VID? I MEAN I WANT 2 SEE THE ACTUAL THING! WHY DIDNT U FILM LONGER?  WASTE OF MY TIME!
This video takes place after a pelican gets killed by an orca, the trainers lead the orca&#39;s into another tank and clean up bits and pieces of the pelican ;-)

I like the song but what&#39;s with watching some bald dude collect bird remains from the pool. Huh????
this guy,   the video,,  is an idiot  woooowooo is awsome wow great is and idiot stupid fuck ... way you fuck a dog  fuck a dog 
@QynceeHotwheels ----good one haha
i just saw the video of the whale killing the bird and when it happens it sounds like the crowd is laughing!
oh hey guys watch out for thaat whale; so dangerous.
what the hell was that crap? 
they are pulling a dead bird out of the pool that the whales killed in the show...
wtf stupid ass wasting our fuckin time!
I hate how if one says the same thing as the top comments.
You can see the big wing she picks up on the deck in the beginning.  This video shows the trainer picking up pieces of a bird.  
@4everNYC21 But there was a trainer that shamu killed right? Or was that another whale? I know he killed a pelican, saw that already
nodar.tribute! now you are1 minute with 32 seconds more idiot..
that was a 1:32 of my lfe

i just wasted 1:32 of my life on a freakin guy swimmin back and forth 
Shamu never killed a trainer. He just killed a pelican. Thats what they were cleaning up.
Would be such a good job

that was a pelican dumb ass
Wait what?
Did i blink and miss something or...? o.e
i like the part at 1:32
worst fuking 1:32 I&#39;ve ever wasted
wow that was totally bs
what a peice of crap video

@crazy4isa shamu? if you liked him so much you would see he is stressed in this environment, i didn&#39;t say he wasn&#39;t nice he has just been driven mad, they try to stop them acting on instinct and predator like and accept commands but you can only supress natural behaviour for so long eventually they will explode, like that tiger that the lion man owns that killed a guy &#39;accidently&#39;, it is stupid whales and dolphins belong in the ocean not in tanks.
yes a whale killed its trainer several time  but no not shamu
@crazy4isa he meant to, it is because he is cooped up cruely in a tank! they should be free.
laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaammmme

What did i just watch?
@kristaraeanne
i watched this video. shamu kills pelacan during a show.
@snuffy1998 acculy 1 the trainer was a girl and 2 u r right but a trainer did get killed by another whale not shamu this video just shows one of the whales eating its food SO LAY OFF PPLZ!
swimming with killer whales good idea! ;(
This was a video of the whale killing a pelican. That&#39;s just nature.
@severmine Because during one of the &quot;Believe&quot; shows a pelican landed in the water and the whales attack it.  Look it up on youtube. Thats where I saw it.
Why is the lady last in line at 0:25 holding a birds severed wing?
wheres the dislike button for this video?!!?

i guess its alright... i love this song anyway
HEY!!!!! IT&#39;S THE FREE WILLY SONG!!!!!! LOL AND A REALLY GOOD SONG TOO!!!! LOVE HIS VOICE!!!! R.I.P
Why the fuck are you playing the Free willy theme ya freggin fuck
this video is not a trainer getting killed. these are bits and pieces of video spliced together.
i saw the whole one before. The whales killed a pelican that landed on the pool
 FALSE LABLING ON YOUR VIDEO!!!
This shows the left overs of the remains of the pelican that the orcas killed.
Just the wrong title geez people
This wasn&#39;t when he killed the trainer. This was when he killed the pelican. Jeez...

the video is actually a pelican that was attacked half way through a show 
wtf 
nobody died 
i mean it not like i want thetrainer to die but still
@lam10515 I think it&#39;s pretty hilarious too!
Killer whales dont do well in captivity. Most animals live longer in captivity but they actually live a lot longer in the wild. In captivity their lifespan is nearly quartered.
god this made me wanna punch a baby
i feel sad that nobody died
Yeah I know... it&#39;s sad that Michael Jackson died. R.I.P.
wow.... i wasted a min of my life watching this crap!  Way to go Nodartribute, lying just so you can tell your sucky imaginary  friends that you have a 3 million viewed show...... I&#39;m pretty pissed off right now  &gt;:C
it was verbal abuse
mean ether


GAY didnt show crap

@LushableLosers Even though he was weird me too
wtf nothing happened
@LushableLosers don&#39;t we all.

ratings been disabled cuz it sucks
What is the trainer taking out the water?
Sick and Lame, way for you to get people to look at your video!
shamu didnt do it
tilicum killed her not shamu
we want to see the real kill quit putting fake videos of shamu not killing anyone!
why isnt anyone dying?
who died
@ilovelpstheyrock well, you cankic yur fee to stay bove surface, but dont start flailing around like a kidwih tourets if one comes near you.
@ilovelpstheyrock the best thing you can do around a shark is be completely still.
fuck you douche. thanks for the incredible time waste
um the whale killed a pelican not a person i was there duhhh 
RIP TRAINOR
@SilverCreature1190 well sharks do have big pointy sharp able to rip/shred a human teeth dont they? but hey i wouldnt swim with the sharks for fear of getting too close to those big pointy sharp teeth
@pkleader1123 

I think when people say that, they say it because they mean the shark doesn&#39;t target humans specifically, like you said, they eat what&#39;s in the water and moves
Sharks do intentionally attack people. Sharks don&#39;t attack people out of defense however, a shark attacks a human when it is hunting for food. Sharks do not care if you&#39;re human. They don&#39;t know who you are or care if you have a family. You look like food. Sharks have a very open diet. If it&#39;s in the water and it moves, sharks will eat it. So by saying sharks dont intentionally attack humans, yes, in fact they do intentionally attack humans. When they are hunting for food.
Why would you lie on the title of your video?
Okay I agree,  I miss M J as well
I don&#39;t think there is a video of her being killed!? Why would there be.. I mean if there is a &quot;video&quot; What!? The guy who did just watch her being killed... Unlesss it was at a show while people where video&#39;ing.
@Makipazia :)
@sadlvl3 I totally agree
@getasimbe yeah dude but orcas are sea animals and they are so fuking killers, thats what they do.. or u want to call the police every time a fish kills an other fish?  its aur foult if we dont respect their fredomm!!!!  
@sadlvl3 they are animals. what is wrong with you. when humans kill humans what do we do with them? do they not receive immediate public condemnation? so because they are animals it&#39;s perfectly fine? that logic is so twisted that i&#39;m actually worried for your mental safety. No one deserves to be murdered, and no murder is excusable.
Lol I know it isn&#39;t a dolphin but couldn&#39;t help but think &quot;Good bye and thanks for all the fish&quot; lmao
cmon ppl wuts wrong with u?????   open u damn eyes and see the truth!!!!!!  one orcakills a human and every body is bitching about it, we kill thousands of animals a day and no ones care!!!!! once in a wile they need revenge too!!!!!!! 
fuck you
That stupid fucker owes me!! nodartribute give me 1:32 back and all of your viewers BITCH!!!!
wth was this???!!!!

wow well this was a wast of time thumbs up if you agree
wth is this!! &gt;:(
This is part of the video where a pelican landed on the water during a show and the whales played with it until is was torn to pieces. The whales were put away and a trainer swam out to remove the bird&#39;s parts. 
I miss Micheal Jackson.
@MrAndrewb777 lol nice did u even know wat i meant xD
what a waste of time and who ever posted this video is a noobbb i wanted to see if some blood and gore 
haha

&gt;:(
&gt;:(
Behehehe, free willy. :D
LIAR!  this is sooo lame.  You Suck
It is worldwide known that youtube is not allowed to expose such dramatic and shocking images( real deaths filmed live) even if they were uploaded by some sick member. Still, I read the comments before playing starnged titled videos, just to avoid wasting time watching what I do not want to watch, ja,ja,ja,ja,jaaaaa!!!!! Got you...
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
YOU
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
Dolphins are intelligent and social creatures that, in the wild, interact with hundreds of pod-mates, hunt communally, and have entire coastlines as their playground. In captivity, all of this is lost. Social partners are restricted to a handful of tank-mates. Captive dolphins are fed dead fish (wild dolphins only catch and eat live fish; they never eat dead fish) and they face a profound reduction in space and stimulation. SOURCE WSPA

@Freindly1000 Will you be there by Michael Jackson
wdf i just wasted 1:32 watching this bo crap
what song
@babyari58 They can&#39;t be set free, they would die, they are domestic because of all the breeding that they have done. it would be nice if they were free but they just can&#39;t
liar!!
People who watched this are not morbid or sick. The interest in this is just a fascination with animals and their aggressive nature.  Don&#39;t put videos on with no content. Live and let live.  
thumbs up if you wasted 1:32 seconds of your life watching this.
scanning thru these comments- i see quite a bit of - &quot;gay- this, and faggot- that etc. and &quot;where is the death???&quot; but what about why this happens in first place? Whether it was an &quot;augmented&quot; video about a whale eating a pelican that landed in the pool faked to look like an actual event (so was the pelican)- why aren&#39;t we talking about NOT putting animals and especially MAMMALS in cages?
fuck this vid so boring
wack ass video
fuck off op
its the last footage from the pelican killing vid :Shamu attacks and kills pelican during show
WTF...  just part of the show, a trainer swimming in the pool?
The only thing good about this video is the song

thumbs up if you came here because you thought it was real human death

@neilandbeatrice 

Fuck you! I am so fucking sick of people lying about their YouTube videos. EVERY GOD-DAMNED DAY! Why? Why do you do it? Fuck you sideways, you fucking bitch.
@danny22aces

FUCK THEM THAT&#39;S WHAT THEY GET FOR FUCKING WITH WILD ANIMALS...NO SYMPATHY!!!!!!!!! TOO BAD!!!
This is of the attack on the pelican, although I think you did this deliberately just to get people to watch it.
om gosh i fell for it
all of the rest of us have lifes you know we dont want to watch this stupid video and this is some cheesey music
ZOMG!!! I can&#39;t believe how much BLOOD there was ... that was so gross!!!
the wahel killed a bird.......not a trainer
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
not what title says...  
Whatever!!!
I loath people who waste my fucking time with their shit videos with bullshit video titles...need attention much?
@teamangels9 it was a pelican! LIER!
@Kurasutaru THEY DO NOT PROMOTE TO KILL THEM WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT????
@megamoneybags THEY DO NOT PROMOTE TO KILL THEM WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT????
@StARbriteexx actually, its a mammal, look it up on google ;)
@megamoneybags well, they save them, they don&#39;t advertise that they protect them, but they do and if it is on the discovery channel, sea world is partnered with animal planet and discovery sao why would thye promote to kill them, read about sea world before you post a comment
@Kurasutaru Seaworld does not promote that, they protect the dolphins
i wished shamu ate all those morons in swimm suits
lier
the only reason you got so many views is coz you said the trainer get&#39;s killed you knob
I was expecting a Rick&#39;roll....
Seaworld protects endangered species of animals, takes care of them, and protects them during natural disasters, why don&#39;t you all pick up a paper and read how Seaworld protects the ocean and its creatures beforde you trash it
sea world doesn&#39;t only keep animals in exhibits, they have them there for studies and they actually like it there. Seaworld has programs that rescue and take care of animals and injured ones, who do you think took care of the animals during the oil spills????
@smooshycakes i agree. it should be called &quot;animals-that-hate-people-and-should-be-left-in-the-wild  world&quot; not sea world. same thing with the zoos.
@StARbriteexx  OK. first of all, im not even close to stupid. your probably the uneducated person sitting in school texting all day, goes home, gets on my space, then sneaks out and smokes pot at night! not me. thanks, but no thanks, i like my brain cells. and second, your the one that&#39;s uneducated, because you didn&#39;t even spell &quot;uneducated&quot; right. and third, there have been several Shamus&#39;s, not just one. they has been around 20, and they all died. probably from torture and lack of space.
well, you kind of have a point. actually, earth will probably be hit by a comet, or after the sun gets like seriously old it starts to expand, then after expanding it will crash into the earth, burning it. then, it will explode and cause a super nova. i think thats right... :P oh well. but yes, studies show that humans will not exist anymore when the world ends.
SEAworld. you see that word SEA?! yeah, thats why it should be in the SEA
@smooshycakes someone just watched the cove lol
shit vid. tuneeeeeeeeeeeeeeee tho
um you should change ur video title, it does not go with the video. thanks for wasting 1:32 min of my precious life
@erisinger Um, I doubt humans will ever go extinct. People are being born everyday. I think if we were ever to be extinct, Earth would have to blow up or some disease just wipes us all out.
@StARbriteexx  you should ashamed of yurself you inconsiderate little brat! its people like u, the people at sea world, and all those black markets that are killing the planet!!! not pollution, and not unrecycaling! if it werent for humans, the damn whales wouldnt be killing people, and the planet wouldnt be polluted! its humans fault for detroying the earth, and for the murder of others!! and it may be morbid of me to say that, but its true! the human society will go extinct before u know it!!!
I think they should just let them go bsc into the wild its wrong to keep them there workin 24/7 its not there fault thats the wat they r ppl should just leave them alone
@7CollegeKid I know!! I hate when people have misleading titles.
gay

change the title dude, its not what the video about

This isn&#39;t from when they killed a trainer, the whales killed a pelican.  There&#39;s a video on youtube called Shamu Attacks and Kills Pelican during show.
very beginning=nom nom :) i love these animals, but its sad how the trainers get killed by them. AINT IT OBIVOUS THEY WANNA BE FREE?!
Omg are you serious the whale killed a Pelican I knew that right when i started watching it because i&#39;ve seen footage of them killing the pelican its pretty awesome
EPIC SONG! 
That was a bird not the trainer
ass -.-
LIARS GO HOME NOBODY LIKES YOU
what Peanut and 619stranger said
yea what he said FUCK YOU!!!!
@JerkersCBintl  Really, what is wrong with you?
actually theyd go all fucked up in the wild cause they were all born in captivity you gorm
flag as spam, misleading video!
actually tht whale wanna free dom
biggest crap on youtube
@staphinfection Man, your post makes me want to butcher a couple of rhinos. 
FUCK YOU JACKASS
lol free willy
This is the bird attack.  Fuck sea world though.  And fuck putting animals into captivity so we can charge people to view them....  Way to exploit nature....

Stop going to fucking zoos, and sea worlds, and just WATCH nature shows.  Start with Planet Earth, it&#39;s amazing and way more in your face then a stupid zoo.
Lol, look at all the angry commenters who didn&#39;t get their fix of death and mayhem.
except its really a stolen video of when they killed a wild PELICAN! No more than a video of a dog getting ahold of a rabbit, or a mouse. Its what they are designed to do! yes they are smart, yes they do tricks, and yes they eat meat!  Just natures way. I have no idea why its labled so cruel. 
@systemaddictshock Me Too actually cause i&#39;d actually make an attempt to laugh
its a pelican
fuck u

Shamu killed a Pelican stupid ass!
aww what a dick
lol guyz u r the one who are misleading yoursleves why the fuck would u watch someone dying?
to please your self? 
i didn&#39;t realize how sick this world is till now 
rofl...that pelican got pwned
fuck you
it&#39;s too bad that you can&#39;t give this video thumbs up or thumbs down, it&#39;s just fun to see a video which has only got thumbs down...
i stopped the video and read the comments first :D
THUMBS DOWN... even though ratings disabled.
your a dick 
Sad bastard
waste of data and bandwith
gay
what a rip off video...and a waste of youtubes time
@jasmine123A Ok, I agree with you that it is annoying that he lied but seriously... crap on his grave? Rip his limbs off? That is SOO uncalled for!
Wow 1:32 of my life I&#39;ll never get back you fucking douche...........

this is soooo dumb
dude, ur a fucktard!!!
oh this is the incident where the pelican was killed. PELICAN. NOT TRAINER. i mean i realize they both have 2 feet but seriously...
Well... &#39;least the music was nice?
that was a total waste of my time.  This should be taken off YOUTUBE.
@beatrixbelle i agree exactly he just got all them views and subscibers for that crap, worthless i didn&#39;t even see a shamu HURT OR HARM  a single person or thing! if u aks me, it&#39;s stupid. i been looking for a rela one showing the shsmu killing the trainer never found one. how stupid.
it didn,t kill the trainer! DUMBASS!
yea you suck
@beatrixbelle Eh, he&#39;s partially correct, only it wasn&#39;t the trainer that got attacked. From the looks of it, this is the last few minutes of the video an audience member shot of the four killer whales attacking and killing a pelican that landed on the water in the middle of the show.
yay! more effing spam vids! ^^
what the hell dont give a friggin misleading title, everyone hates you now. welcome to the 21st century
@dethyl yes. imma fat ass. lol
It&#39;s a fake, Shame ate a pelikan in this video.
If I were a killer whale I&#39;d attack too if I had to hear this child molesters song one more time. 
fuck you for posting this  punk
@xxmidnightravenxx1 Haha you&#39;re a fatass.
I&#39;d rather be Rickrolled than watch this.
wheres the death? i paid good money to watch this
and wth noone died why did you put trainor killed? if nobody died?
u took this vid from another person

thank goodness no one died :D
WEIRD! You DISABLED the ratings for this video! 
this is so fake!
the only reason i am still watching this video is because of good song choice (MJ)
Micheal was genius
fucking garbage.....

hahaha, wasnt this song in free willy?
i could of done alot more things with that tim this sucks u should of atleast changed the tittle shamu show
great song
@lynnandian michael jackson - will you be there
happy ending, looks like no one was injured at all.
@CoolAngelica99 LOL :P good one hahaha
i think youtube should ban you from posting videos. this is by far the worst video ever. why would you post this. nothing happened, i expected to see someone gett killed like ur video said. like the other 2 people said, a big waste of my life here.
@lynnandian michel jackson free willy hahha
what the heack is this song?
who dies?
WE WANT SOME DIED

HOLY TITS....
@MonkeyzRule10112 trust me there are videos up.
some ppl just dont listen to park instructors.
is that why rating is disabled for this vid? cus it&#39;s crap and nobody&#39;s gonna like it?
they probly killed it harpoooned it and just its natureal instinct
thats stuopid

@xxgeordiejulesxx lol
whoever posted this video stole it from the original poster.  This was actually shot a couple years ago.  The whale jumps up out of the water and grabs a pelican and then the whales tear it apart.  You can see the female trainer on the deck carrying half of the bird and walking off stage with it.  The guy trainer then goes into the water to retrieve several pieces of the bird.  The original poster has the proper title on it and it is 10 min. long.  It shows the whale jump up and grab the bird.
@Unpronouncebal  ive removed my 1st comment so others arent tempted to watch it
@Unpronouncebal Have fun with it then. It&#39;s 8¬Ω mins of pain.
@xxgeordiejulesxx lol it cant be that bad
@Unpronouncebal ,to be honest,i would advise you watch some reaction videos to it first if you intend watching it............but  i shouldnt have told you to wach it,for that i am sorry
Michael Jackson! 
@xxgeordiejulesxx hmmmm.... mabye lol
@letthebeatrok k~
I WANNA SEE DEATH D:&lt;
@MisoRamensama you are correct :) and this video is still fucking hilarious!
Wow the whale really killed him, what the hell is this shit.
This video was ripped off of Normkangaroo&#39;s, if I am correct. 
omg hey moron how the crap is that a trainer? wow ur stupid change title and that music sucks
WOW! I&#39;M STUNNED!!!! THAT WAS SHOCKING!!! 
   FUCK YOU, WHOEVER JUST WASTED MY TIME!!!
Awful music had to quit early
this will never happened if they wouldnt hunt this wales idiots 
but nothing happened...
what is that thing that he puts in a bucket???
sea world dont screw with us
what is song name?
I was at that show when I was on vacation, it was absolutely traumatizing...people were screaming, there was so much chaos and confusion - why would anyone want to see someone drown in such a violent way? There was such an uncomfortable silence that could be felt throughout the park, security guarding Shamu Stadium, news choppers hovering over the area, camera crews posted outside of the entrance even after they reopened the show the following weekend. My condolences go out to Dawn&#39;s family. 
i can see that is some one is killed get a life plz ! 
fuck whoever made this video
gay music
interesting music choice for a video about &quot;someone getting killed&quot; you poop eater

@ashthegreat Exactly, glad we can agree on that :)
This is only a part of &quot;Shamu attacks and kills Pelican during show&quot; by normkangaroo. 
nothin happed dont watch this cause noby died they just want alot of views.

I think hes loking for the trainer that died

this was from when they killed a pelecan during the show
this is one song i actually liked by MJ
yawn

fucking waste of time
@liveforepicness ..then y r u here?
gay song

@ashthegreat well your the dumbass that was searched for this video, he must have wanted to see someone die..
Lol page 108
@babychika1230 No you aren&#39;t friend sorry
@yellowsub134  your comment was okay until you accused the person of being a &quot;fag&quot;.  Quite extrodinary to use such a word to lend itself in a way as to insult a person, when you are talking passionately about soldiers and wars which usually relate to fighting for freedoms and peace for all people to live amongst one another in a humane way.  I don&#39;t care what the person wrote that so upset you, you just blew yourself out of the water. (pardon the pun)
@ItisDoom  seams that your time is so valuavle. jajaja
this vid sucks
@ashthegreat i totally agree!
we want dead people we want dead people !!
@ashthegreat  JOIN THE IRAK WAR???
@ItisDoom   This is peppermintyy and omg I know right WASTE OF MY FRICK&#39;N TIME!!!!!!!! DONT OUT SHIT ON LIKE THIS!!
gay
wow nobody died waste of time I wasted a 1:35 out of my lifr
Killer whales are awesome animals to see, on pictures and videos. But they are not animals to use for shows and all that shit. 
Why advertise something that doesnt hapen? whats the point?
@ashthegreat dude you&#39;re missing the point, it&#39;s not that i want to see someone die. but i was looking for a video of the killer whale attacking the trainer, and this isn&#39;t it. it&#39;s false advertising.
Fuk I don&#39;t beleive it. another fake title video clip!
This is a video of the aftermath of a killer whale eating a pelican! The trainers are getting the pelicans body parts out of the water!
the guy dident even get killed
Why would you want to see someone be killed bye a whale?
but still I don&#39;t like fake videos.
you are a stinking liar! 
@NolaSaint17 u cant put tat online bt ters a video seconds before she gets draged in its called Tourist&#39;s Camera Rolls Seconds Before Whale Attack its on the side n its 6:57 long
This is so cute. I love watching people work with animals and no one gets hurt. People shouldn&#39;t be angry that they didn&#39;t see someone get hurt. That&#39;s just sick.
@ashthegreat    well said.. I&#39;m just glad there are still some people like you 
this is stupid-and micheal jackson was a child molesting freak.
the only dead thing in this video are the fish 
Only at Seaworld.
wowowow false advertisement buddy

zoos are so cruel :(

@italianmale6008 haha good one lol
You&#39;ve stolen my original footage that I posted on youtube a couple of years ago and quite sickly added inapropriate text to the part you have used. Every part of your video is false and I have reported you to youtube.
go to fucking hell you dipshit i hate you don&#39;t put any more videos on youtube. please leave public spaces alone.

The real joke is how much money this guy has made off over 2million views... so comment all you want hating on him he doesn&#39;t care.
god fucking damn it!!!!!  This is not where the bitch dies.  I wanted to see the video of the lady getting killed.  Instead I&#39;ve had my time wasted.
Real classy move! Your family must be proud...
wow that waz a biggggg wast if time!!!!!!!!
wow F*** you man waste my time with this sh**
free the damn whales...
thats not the whale killing a trainer thats film footage of them trainers cleaning up the remains of a pelican after the whales attacked it when it landed on the water. the park wasn&#39;t evacuated
the only one dead in this video is mj haha
it just so happens that this video was posted the day a person was REALLY killed by a 
killer whale. why even waste ur life putting this video on youtube. because clearly a bird is not A FUCKING PERSON!
um.......the killer whale only killed the bird........and its just showing its remains.....
@mymajorpain1 i always do
jou ma se poes
Shamu is nice he would never hurt anyone, I even petted him SeaWorld when I was like 6 or 7.
Guys youtube will not allow ppl to post a violent graphic video where someone dies in it.  To see videos like that you would have to go to wwwDOTogrishDOTcom but that site has been closed down and a similar site remade but it has less graphic videos in it now called wwwDOTliveleakDOTcom
fuck this noise
@ChemicalRespirator wtf?
pelican and the herons were there because of the fish leftovers.  
It looks like it wanted to play, unfortianantly the pelican was easialy cut in to pieces.
Killer whales are so cute =3
