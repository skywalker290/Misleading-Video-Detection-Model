You must have all been terrified!  Thank you for posting, and kudos to the Japanese people for their resiliance in the face of such devastation and loss.  You showed the world how to behave with civility under such immense challenges.  Sincere condolences to all those who experienced loss and bereavement. ❤
この方達本当ならこの日に楽しい旅行が待ってたか、旅行先から帰宅して楽しい思い出になってたはずなんだよね…
No large planes! They were told .
東日本大震災を忘れないようにと定期的に津波の動画を見るようにしているけど、仙台空港が完成・開港した当時、宮城県岩沼市出身で元満鉄社員・東北大建築科卒の祖父（震災前に亡くなった）が空港関係者でもないのに涙を浮かべて<br>「とうとう我が町にもこんな立派な東京直通の空港が?これほどめでたい事があるだろうか。大陸に散った同僚や同級生達、戦中・戦後と苦労した両親や兄弟、村の衆よ、この新聞を見てくれ!みんな生きてこの様子を見ていたなら、どれほど喜んだ事か。ほら、みんな見えているか?こんな立派な空港が俺達の町にも出来たぞ!」<br>「誰がこの空港を作ろうと発案してくれたかは知らないが、これで孫やその次の世代は新幹線以上に東京や世界の国とまた繋がれる。勉強を一生懸命に頑張れば、東京や海外の大学や院にも行かせやすくなる。それがこれからはもっと楽に叶うんだな…たくさんの宮城県の子供が、画面越しじゃなく広い世界を見られるようになる。留学だって旅行だって、もっと目標に出来るようになる。戦争の時の俺達みたいに諦めないでよくなるんだ。<br>親だって国内の他県だろうが国外だろうが子供が生き生きとしていれば嬉しい。それでたまに帰ってきて顔が見られれば、いいことづくめだ。<br>めでたい。本当にめでたい。<br>俺の戦後がこれで本当に終わった!」<br>と家の仏壇や寺にある先祖の墓や戦後に建立された慰霊碑に向かって新聞の切り抜きを見せて回り、いつも必ず最後には満面の笑顔をくしゃくしゃに崩してその場に突っ伏して泣いたり大喜びしていたのを傍で見ていて覚えているので、仙台空港が津波に呑まれた瞬間を捉えたこの動画を見ると個人的にいつも悲しくなる。<br>達筆で読書家で料理作りや裁縫が得意だった祖母も、「夫の故郷が、知り合いが、ご近所が」とこの震災のショックが大きすぎて不眠症になるほどテレビの報道を見過ぎた結果、震災後1週間も経たず転倒して別人のように失語症になったり読み書きがダメになったり認知症を併発したりして、最終的に数年後に亡くなるまで親戚中が二重の意味でずっと大騒ぎだったし。
Kya hua unn logon ka kya wo bache
内陸部だって津波に飲まれてしまう。海無し県も他人事ではないね。
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_6iDBoOvb0&amp;t=81">1:21</a> から外の音が大きくなったかな？
空港が火事にならなくて良かった。<br>なってもおかしくない状況だったんだと改めて痛感しました。<br>当時、お母さんが空港に避難してました。お父さんとお祖父さんは、家と集会所にいたので、助かりませんでした。<br>お祖父さんと一緒にいた犬が奇跡的に助かり一緒に暮らしてましたが、今年の1月に亡くなりました。<br>10年間支えてくれてありがう。
What an extraordinary sight to see at an International Airport!<br><br>Certainly not something that the planners gave any consideration to when they located such an important airport on a site historically known for being inundated by tsunamis!<br><br>Likewise the planners and regulators responsible for siting a nuclear power station right where it would be most susceptible to catastrophic damage from earthquakes and tsunamis!
блять бабы как всегда завывают как сирены
Sendai Airport is all back to normal now, its a great airport. I have been many times, just sad to read some of the few morons comments (thank God only a few) below
動画の最後辺り、音がすごいですが<br>空港の中にも水が入ったんでしょうか....恐ろしい<br>自分の地域は南海トラフの地域なので、怖いです。

車がものすごい勢いで流されてるのがわかる…<br><br>津波のパワーがわかる貴重な映像ですね。
内部から見ると外から見たのより恐怖を感じます……<br>主さんが無事であることを願います
当時空港の中にいたこの人達で、この動画を見てる方いますか？？当時は、すぐに空港内からは脱出することは出来ませんでしたよね？自分の車も流されたでしょうし、これだけ高く長い間、空港そのものが津波に囲まれていた訳ですから。その日は空港に特別許可で寝泊まりしたんですか？？ごはんやお風呂はどうしましたか？？何時間後に脱出出来ましたか？
最近、仙台空港行ったけれどこんなんだったって考えられません
Hello, <br><br>My name is Ann McGarry and I work at Oregon Public Broadcasting in Portland, Oregon. We would like to use this video clip in a television program we are working. Please let me know if this is at all possible and thank you,<br><br>Ann McGarry
Is it common in japan to make that noise like a motor bike changing gears?....naaaaaaaaa ahhhhhhhhhh. naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

もっと長く撮っていられなかったの？
仙台空港は、現在の場所で引き続き運用するのかな。もっと内陸に移した方がいいのでは。

去年の10月に仙台空港を利用しました。この時の壊滅的な被害が嘘のように震災前の機能に回復してました。ボランティアや自衛隊の方々が頑張ってくれたんですね。本当に頭が下がります！
↓コメ許せない。
被災地はあの日の事忘れらなくて悲しい思いを抱えながら精一杯の笑顔で前進してます。
是非その事だけでも理解してください。
せーしョ貼ってるやつはなんなんだ？
先日、空港でこの角度から見ました。
信じられません...。
ヨハネの福音書（漁師ヨハネの記録）

16 実に神は、ひとり子をさえ惜しまず与えるほどに、世さいまを愛してくだ­した。

それは、神の御子を信じる者が、だれ一人滅びず、永遠のいのちを得­るためです。

*聖書*

ヨハネの黙示録（ヨハネの見た幻） 
 

二二
１５都の外には、神様から離れた者、魔術師、不道徳な者、人殺し、偶像礼拝者、好んでうそをつく者、偽りを行なう者がうごめいています。 １６わたし、イエスは、これらすべてを諸教会に知らせるため、あなたがたに使者を送りました。 わたしはダビデの根であり、その子孫です。 また、ひときわ輝く明けの明星です。 １７聖霊様と花嫁は、『来てください』と言っています。 これを聞く人々は、同じように『来てください』と言いなさい。 のどが渇いている人〔求めている人〕は、だれでも来なさい。 そして、いのちの水を、ただで飲みなさい。 
 

空港内の皆様の悲痛な叫びが、体に突き刺さります。
to this day this video is one of the most surreal things i&#39;ve ever seen. i mean, yea of course all the news footage too.. but it&#39;s just creepy being in that airport seeing it like that. i couldn&#39;t imagine at all.. not one bit.. what it would&#39;ve been like to be there. i hope those of you who were in it and survived all the best. and RIP those who didn&#39;t. love from the US. i pray for all of you to fully recover what has been lost. stay positive. 
@Apvatar3000 .. FUK you too men :) ..you&#39;ll keep getting disasters as long as your nation continues eating intelligent creatures .  :( 
仙台空港行ってみたけどすっかり復興してますね。
でも津波が来たことは忘れちゃいけないな。
..thats what you get when you abuse nature...( apparently some nations think it is still ok to kill whales and dolphines for consumption....and coincidentally these are often the same nations &quot;assaulted&quot; by nature...go figure..
Omg. I hope everyone got out ok..
God with you guys
駐車場の車は駄目になったけど皆さんが無事であることがなによりも良かった。

nandemo minshutou no seini surunayo
its like standing still watching n waiting to be dead.. huh.. i wonder where can i run when watch this video...huhuhu.. scary view...
I just cannot imagine being in an airport, waiting for a flight, and then watching as something this unbelievable and frightening suddenly occurred. 

And not only that - after the tsunami, you&#39;d be stranded there. No planes could land or take off; certainly no vehicles could get to you either.

一 １５ 「いよいよ、来るべき時が来ました。 神の国が近づいたのです。皆、悔い改めなさい。 このすばらしい知らせに従って行動するのです。」 
 
マルコの福音書
 
一三 
救われる人は少ないのか 
１ そのころ、ガリラヤ出身のユダヤ人が数名、エルサレムの神殿で供え物をしていた時、ピラトに殺害されたというニュースが、イエスに伝えられました。 
２ これを聞いたイエスは、逆に、お尋ねになりました。 「あなたがたは、この人たちが、ほかの、どのガリラヤ出身の人よりも罪が深かったから、こんな災難に会ったと思うのですか。 ３それは違います。 あなたがただって、今の悪い行ないをやめて神に立ち返らなければ、同じように滅びるのです。 
４ そうそう、シロアムの塔の下敷きになって死んだ人がいました。確か……十八人でした。 彼らのことはどう思いますか。 エルサレムで一番罪深い人たちだったのでしょうか。 ５とんでもありません。 あなたがたも罪を悔い改めないなら、同じように滅びるのです。」 
 
マルコの福音書  *聖書*
今回の災害で人命・家・私財・公共物・ビル・畑・田んぼが丸ごと奪われ、その上民間企業の業務停止に電気の問題に農産物・水産物の悪影響か　うーん　現実逃避したくなるわ　未来が見えない…

あなた達、恥ずかしくないんですか？被災者の方達を何だと思ってるんですか？この動画は遊び半分で載しているのでないんですよ！？地震や津波の怖さ、すごさ、危なさを我々は次の世代へ教えていかなければならない。そのためにもこの動画は必要なんじゃないでしょうか？

@InfamousDainton this is a video that tsunami attacked Sendai airport at the 11th last month. this happened about 30 minutes after mag 9.0 earthquake. Voices are grandmas grieving for that.

空港内からの映像、初めてみました...
空港内からも映像、初めてみました...
今まで見た津波の中で一番スピードが早い津波ですな。
あっという間に横切っていく・・・。
愛犬を里親で引き取ったとき初めて出会ったのが仙台空港でした。
愛犬との思い出の場所がずたずたにされたのが悲しい・・・。
It&#39;s very sad hearing the people&#39;s voices in the clip.  =(
この動画自体希少な資料だと思うのですが、震災当日に投稿されているのがなにより凄いと思います。携帯や電話などのインフラが当日はズタズタだったと思うのですが、どうやって投稿されたのでしょうか。
こんだけ壊されりゃ建設系の仕事増えるし無職でも簡単に雇うだろうし尊敬に値するらしい団塊豚死にまくったし俺は益災だと思うわｗJCとかJK死んだのは勿体無いと思うけど必要な犠牲だわなｗ
これから海辺に空港がある県は見直したほうがいいかもしれない。津波の時、災害地への物資の空輸ができなくなる。
がっつい、うんだもうしたん。
自然災害の恐ろしさを痛感しました。
撮影者さんやこの建物に避難した方たち、少しでも多くの方が助かってくれたことがまず何よりもありがたいです。

仙台空港は何度も行っている場所です。
送迎待ちで、駐車場で仮眠をしてたこともあります。

海の近くだとは知っていてもこの場所にこんな津波が来ることがあるなんて、一度も考えたことがありません。
頭の片隅にも思い描いたことがありません。

このアングルの場所にも立ったことがありますが、こんな光景、本当に信じられません。

我々日本人はこの事を決して忘れてはいけない

stupid people clicking LIKE.... it&#39;s just bad facebook habit... fuckin LIKE button

I don&#39;t like the way Japan handles the Kuril Islands dispute, but I would never wish this disaster on anyone. I&#39;m glad the Sendai airport building held up.
Recently Japan has a hard time.

I&#39;m now in a safe place in Japan but my family and my friends are now in the stricken area. I contact with them everyday.

I would like to ask you (if it is possible) to give a fund-raising for the stricken area. Your action will save Japan and I appreciate for it.

Thank you very much for reading my message.
AHH!!! Scary!
Google翻訳はとても素晴らしいです！
@oddblob99 Yeah you should.
@oddblob99 Yup
仙台空港でも旅行者の何人かが亡くなっています。
大津波の恐怖、海外の事例はいくつも聞いていたけれどまさか日本にて経験するものが出てくるとは・・・

M9.0は正に未曾有の地震だったと言えます。
映像で見ているだけなのに、怖くて涙が出てきました
@loveesongx I don&#39;t doubt that your heart was in the right place, that&#39;s cool, it&#39;s just that the actual comment was a little crass (i.e. the &#39;all nations not just the USA&#39; bit). Remember, people in the UK and France give around twice as much money to charities, per person, than people in the US do. 
何とか助け得た、今、日本に到達する方法を見つけようとしてイム。

Fucken mean video.

@banjosolid Lmao, kk. 
@SimulacronX and yours is you think you know me
@CharlotteL1029 
i did, its the only thing we can help the japanese with at the moment.
best wishes from germany.
This is terrifying...
@banjosolid I earnt it in a way though 
C&#39;mon guys, stop arguing.just help them.Peace..
@mrstone56 nope dont wanna get dizzy, praying is just fine for me.
衝撃の映像だ!!
@apsl76 my definition include everything .
@TheCerberusInferno Define powerfull.
Electronics are sold out even before they are manufactured in japan
Some of my best friends died in the earthquake/tsunami. I may not be religious, but it does mean a lot when people pray, because it means they care. 
@hall717 I&#39;m not a staunch anti religion fanatic that roots out all religious comments on here to try to convert people. I just found it really insulting when I read how people said they would pray for the people of Japan which to me is a total cop-out and not very &#39;Christian spirited&#39; as they like to refer to it. To effectively resign yourself to &#39;Thinking&#39; ?  ;p. What&#39;s the saying? &quot;One pair of able hands is worth a million prayers&quot; Anyway, I&#39;m blabbering. Take care :)
@sijotakane This tsunami don&#39;t scare me , i have the spirit of a warrior , if i&#39;m talking about me , i&#39;ll say that i&#39;m smarter than anyone in situation like that , no one can survive extreme situation , except me .
@BSEmadcow Having seen a documentary on Amish people I understand your viewpoint better now. I can see where you&#39;re coming from but that&#39;s extreme. And I still can&#39;t get over the fact that some people in poverty live by their God, and just saying you&#39;re believing in something which doesn&#39;t exist, would be like a slap in their face, and it would feel like I&#39;m taking something away from them. I don&#39;t like the feeling that I&#39;m taking something away from someone who already has next to nothing. :)
Japan is not really a powerfull country .
@banjosolid Atleast I donated some money .. Most people from my country can&#39;t donate 
@Poetamo im saying the person video taping is not japanese lol.
@echizenn808 really? sorry, my mistake. where from?
@SimulacronX different. -_- Not better, not worse, just different. By the way, than you for thinking you have the right to insult me
ここならともかく１階や駐車場にいた人たちはかなり流されたでしょうね。
生きてる事や助かった事に感謝しましょう。そして生き抜いてください。
未来や希望まで津波に流された訳ではないのですから。
@hall717 I see the analogy is wasted on you. The point Im trying to make is that you are fighting a battle against common sense and reason for an ideology that is flawed in it&#39;s very essence The fact that prayer doesnt help ANYONE. There is no evidence to the contrary. Are you happy that a (Im presuming elder) &#39;person&#39; told you Santa wasn&#39;t real when you were a child? You no longer post mail to him,nor wonder why he never delivers,nor get ridicule! That person did you a service.Do it for others.
@BSEmadcow not because it makes them feel good, but because it is essential for them. Some non-religious people just come across as arrogant and ignorant about the fact that sometimes God is all those people have in their life. 
All I am saying is that non-religious people should not be offended just cos some religious person says he/she is praying. Not all religious people starve their children waiting for this years harvest...
@hall717 Your intentions start from a good place, but those intentions are about as useless as praying.Instead of &#39;those people being lifted out of ignorance, you&#39;d rather give them a double dose, because it makes them &#39;feel good?.Maybe YOU should be angry that religion infected their society/politics/education in the first place? Would you advocate &#39;dancing for rain&#39;? even tho you know its nonsense? The tribe has no food and relying on this years harvest to feed the children? Didn&#39;t think so...
@mightykuma So what karma is a scientifically proven thing is it? So yes, karma IS voodoo. 
@mightykuma You just ran out of things to say and argue about so you brought karma in to it? Who actually believes in that kind of voodoo? Surely not someone as educated as you claim to be. And as for money donating to Japan going on towards Africa... the money you donate barely makes it to Japan. This may come as a shock to you, but none of that money is going to Africa.....
@BSEmadcow This is the reason why I get mad when non-religious people go mad at people for believing in their religion. Because of the ignorance. Not everyone is as lucky and people aren&#39;t well educated everywhere in this world, that they&#39;d have the scientific knowledge that we here in the west have. 
Some unfortunate people live in this world, surviving through their life through belief in their God, and I do not for one second believe that anyone has the right to blame them for anything. 
@BSEmadcow I don&#39;t care whether they are wrong or right. It&#39;s their belief, people who aren&#39;t as lucky as you and me,who live on less a dollar a day and who have nothing, are just going through life because they believe in their God. Of course I do not believe in religion, and I think it&#39;s holding humanity back. But as long as there is poverty, there will be religion, because when nothing is going your way, when you can&#39;t feed your children and when you survive day by day, God is the only hope. 
@mightykuma I never said I dont believe in giving to charity. I just believe giving to charities which are largely beneficiary for poorer countries in Africa. Where there own country cannot afford basic amenities. 
@hall717 With all due respect your position is flaccid. In your apathy and ignorance when turning a blind eye to their/your?&#39; beliefs,You&#39;re holding humility back in it&#39;s progress in understanding this complex universe and everything in it.Thank goodness they&#39;re people that think on a grander scale and out-side of the box! instead of reverting to&quot;God dun it&quot;People who pray don&#39;t advance the human race; the opposite.Religions put their &#39;beliefs&#39; in the public domain they&#39;re open for scrutiny.End!
@BSEmadcow YOU&#39;RE saying they&#39;re not doing anything constructive. But they believe they are. They believe they are doing the best they can.
And as I already pointed out, maybe they did also make financial contribution, what gives you or any other person the right to judge them? What makes you think just cos they are praying they&#39;re not doing anything else? 
And anyway, it&#39;s their belief, you don&#39;t wanna believe, fine. But don&#39;t go around getting annoyed at them for practising their belief. 
ばばちゃんの訛りが地元そっくりで泣けるなあ...。
People all over the world:
Everyone, please please help Japan. Considerable people are suffering from hunger, coldness, disease, loneliness JUST NOW. Of course pray for Japan gives warmness. But it is just for the people who is NOT in disaster area. The people there needs foods, medicine, blanket, rescue. Please donate your one coin. It really helps Japan.

東北に寄付するマネーなどない！
@BSEmadcow The scientific tests show no positive results.  In fact, in one test the people prayed for (upon?) did worse - probably because of social pressure.  Do a google search for 16569567 and read the abstract of the paper &quot;Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP) in cardiac bypass patients: a multicenter randomized trial of uncertainty and certainty of receiving intercessory prayer.&quot;
@NickPwnsUTube Donate to the general fund of the Red Cross then.

@hall717 So,we need a definition of what people mean when they say they are going to &#39;pray for them&#39;. Lets go with &#39; Sitting/kneeling while not actually doing anything constructive&#39; . So, it makes your blood boil uh? That makes two of us! 
@jobbieteeth I&#39;m open minded. How about you show me some proof that can be scientifically verified that praying does anything other than benefit the feeble mind of the person doing the praying. Oh by the way, I&#39;m sure the religious &#39;cults&#39; will be really happy on your position of &#39;regular peoples money&#39; not being sufficient. I mean they never got rich by passing the collection plate around did they? And you have the gall to call that guy/girl close minded. pfft.
@banjosolid yes it is &quot;his&quot; ema because this is the tax system this country supports. If you don&#39;t like it get out.
@eevil123 I guess that&#39;s why they call u eevil!!! just kidding lol.
@banjosolid 
Rediculous fool.
At least he is sharing the wealth for the greater good.
Pathetic disgusting creature.
Maybe when your life is swept away by a ferocious wave your tune will change?
@Js5s141 
You are a closed minded man.
Money may help in respects to physical matters appertaining to the chaos caused by the floods...
 The amount of money &quot;regular&quot; people donate merely scratch the surface when it comes to easing the destruction caused.
Praying in all of its forms, whether it be Christian, Islamic, Meditative or any other form of prayer, will ease the negative flow of energies and help on a multi-dimensional plane.

Laugh all you like, soon you will realise you were the fool.

Oh my god! I feel so sorry for all the people of Japan!! My thoughts are with you!
@lleewwiisss ok if 1 billion people donate £100 to Japan would that help ? NOt even 1 billion, but 1 million
Imagine this airport part happening somewhere like LAX or Gatwick. People would be going mad. You can only hope there wasn&#39;t anyone out in the car park or inside their car.
holy shit!
@TheTimidRockstar you started it. &quot;idiot&quot;
That is so fucking scarey.
@NickPwnsUTube &lt;--smart person atleast
@TheTimidRockstar how am i an idiot? I said tell me how my money can help my friends in japan? I would rather send it direct to my friends. &quot;idiot&quot;
I may be slightly extremist, but why donate to one of the richest countries in the world? They have the money, resources and contingency plans to fix it. 
That&#39;s my two cents, don&#39;t let it stop anyone from doing what they want to do.
@BigboyDownStairs 

Praying doesn&#39;t do anything helpful and it&#39;s a cheap way of passing up the responsibility of helping others. I don&#39;t care if you pray AND donate because at least you&#39;re doing something useful. Praying will not give these people food or shelter.
@The1stPoster 

Of course, I&#39;m donating half of my monthly pay.
@BigboyDownStairs I will pray for their safety and give as much as I can to help them. You are right in your point as well. People have become so intolerant of one another and each other&#39;s beliefs.
@Js5s141 why not do both eh?!
why donate? the reason the money was needed was to send aid over... everyone needs to get the fuck out of japan asap the radiation levels are so high. If that plant blows then japan = no more &gt;.&lt;
not being offensive or anything, i&#39;m a major otaku and have friends in japan just saying i think your money will go to waste. If anyone would like to tell me how the money could benefit the japanese right now then i would be more than happy to donate. but as it stands i&#39;m poor enough as it is... sorry:S
People need to stop commenting &quot;praying doesn&#39;t do anything&quot;, who the fuck are you to say that? Good people are donating money, I just don&#39;t understand what the problem is for praying for their safety?  
Why do non religious people get so offended when someone says I&#39;m praying for them? GTFOH.
They are praying, maybe that&#39;s the best they can do. Or maybe they have some sense and don&#39;t go around the web saying &quot;oh I donated £45, yes I did look at me, look how good i am&quot;. Maybe they did donate but just choose not to tell the whole friggin world. 
Seriously, I&#39;m not religious but it boils my blood when I see people getting annoyed at religious people for praying. JUST LET THEM BE.
Sure, we could prey for these people...or we could do something productive and actually help them.
@TomStraub You&#39;re an idiot.
I am in no way religious but if people want to pray LET THEM. Some people cant just pop out to cash to change someones life. Its just not always possible
@mattserria117 prayig isnt lazy, Im not religious but if the most you can do why not do it. Its just their way of being respectfull
@TomStraub stop shiving your religion down peoples throat and go tell it to people who agree with you... I have nothing agianst religion but people arent going to change their views, leave them be
@TomStraub its japan not the whole world.. sorry i just dont agree xxxxx
@alsotehgame please do
I really hope everyones okay, I dont care if I get hate for this but I will be thinking of you all. Not everyone can donate money. you mightas well donate your time and thoughts is anything xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
@Js5s141 not everyone has money to donate, really wish they did xx
@mattserria117 That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m saying: I&#39;m trying to help you but you just completely ignore me. Good for you for sending them money, but people deal with disaster in their own ways! These people are praying for those who have died in this horrific inciddent and you&#39;re bashing them! I don&#39;t mean to make this sound so mean but I gotta get my message accross: Will your money bring back the dead? no. It will help the living, so you do that while relgiious people pray for the dead.
仙台空港は何度も孤立してるとの事でテレビで映っていましたが、中からのは見たことなかったので衝撃的です

Money won&#39;t go to them until their Emperor asks for international help. 
@USE4life 

The rapture my friend, the rapture.

It&#39;s all foretold by God in the holy scripture.
@TomStraub no i wont you will just look an idiot. Even if it was true you would die too so why would i be sorry? 2012 marks the end of the Mayan calendar so it was made before Jesus was born and cant be to do with christianity
Keep Donating  Rip To Lives Lost
I open my mouth wide :O
@TomStraub buuuuuut he doesn&#39;t?
@kingt34 By getting people to donate to charities that will send food, clothes etc instead of people just getting on there knees and saying a few words and leaving it at that and even then, donating to charities that will send them bibles which are just not needed, some how makes me a bad person? I&#39;ve donated to Japan on the 14th as well? Try to do a bit of good in this world and people just bash you. 
@USE4life 

You&#39;ll be sorry when the heavens are raining down with meteors of divine justice...
@TomStraub no its not stfu
@Js5s141 

Every time you pray, God donates a dollar to the relief effort.
Call a plumber! This is one time we actually need Super Marios help.
OMG i would be running not taking a video 
@TomStraub o please, that stuff doesnt exist. move on
2012 people.
£100 of my ema to them =D 
Instead of praying, how about donating money?
Im very sorry.
TVじゃ見かけないですよね。TV局から提供のお願いみたいのが来ても良さそうですが
@MyUnLucky Donate, don&#39;t be lazy and pray. If you do donate, don&#39;t give to a Christian foundation which will send bibles, people need food and clothes, not Biblical Propaganda. 
Why do all the best videos only last for a minute or two.
@Skillzeh989 Cry more please.
It looks like it&#39;s moving so slow, but it&#39;s so powerful. Great footage, putting a face on this tragedy is helping people to donate I believe.
fake and gay
@olapp - How could this be comedy? It&#39;s not funny at all. It&#39;s scary. It reminds us that we are powerless and insignificant against the forces of nature.
@yut333 - Your statement is more than rediculous, it is insane. You need mental help (therapy and medication). You have been watching too much Alex Jones and Infowars. What about the eathquakes in Chile and New Zealand? What about the earthquakes in California and the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. and Canada? Are we nuking ourselves? No man, or government has the power to create natural disaters. 
@yut333 What planet are you from? Do you have nothing better to do than come up with crap like that?
Only one request last by a beginning.

help.
 
So sad. Bless Japanese people.

You are not alone. Chinese people are alway with you!
god their voices are annoying
@yut333 you sir are a fucking moron. 
why did it have to be japan? why couldnt it happen here? Japanese are the least to deserve this! ;(
Is that really the end of the video? Is there a longer version of this somewhere, or did the person recording just stop recording right then?
I hope everything gonna be better soon
@haylin2007 i know.... thats what i said
oh por Dios que terrible ! que desatre tan grande! y que tristeza nos invade!
@hometownfreebies omg just whatt we need, more religious retards
@rockorsario - We are in the &quot;labor pains&quot; or &quot;birth pains&quot; the Bible describes regarding the last days before Christ returns. Just as labor pains in childbirth become more frequent and intense, so will the things described in Matthew 24:3-8. Check it out for yourself. Jesus is our &quot;Noah&#39;s Ark&quot; for this generation. Seek Him.
pray?? pray?? for fuck&#39;s sake help them, not just fucking pray, useless bastards
The escalating screams and gasps that are going along with the rising tides are incredibly goosebump inducing. That must have been absolutely mortifying.
I&#39;m still trying to absorb the fact that this has really happened...
@Poetamo The one vidoe taping is not japanese...........
&quot;¡aaaaaaaAAAAAAAAH! ¡aaaaAARARARARAHh!&quot;
Why do japanese people scream like that? the noise is similar to driving a motorcycle, !!

By the way, i&#39;m really sad for the japanese people. But as they are demonstrating, they are very strong. I`m pretty sure that Japan will be rebuild in no time. In fact, I believe that they will grow stronger after this hecatomb.
@theocruz02 yes but to lower the water level they need to hunt more whales and dolphins.
Nature is striking back, for all those whales and dolphins Japan that Japan kills every year.
no no no . i cry
This is painful to watch and listen to. My heart goes out to all you people in Japan that are affected by this terrible catastrophe and shame on you who post disgraceful comments....
@xar901 wow, ну и чмо
@taylormac1993 It says &#39;news and politics&#39;...
It make me very sad.
Because I love Japen culture.
Pray for people who die in disater.
さみしいです　

@BravOoTwo Możesz wraz z Tuskiem Olejnik i Palikotem kłamać narodowi Polskiemu w żywe oczy ale prawda i tak wyjdzie na jaw. Szkoda mi ciebie, w dzień sądu gdy przyjdzie stanąć wraz z Antonim, Jarosławem, Pospieszalskim po prawicy Pana, Ciebie nie będzie miał kto uratować. Miłego oglądania TVN i narkotyzowaina się liberohedonizmem 
Wow
I love Japanese people and culture, this makes me sad
The category is Comedy.... What a dick!
เสียใจด้วยจริงๆๆเป็นห่วงพวกคุณทุกคนจังเลย

@sg0159 Are you stupid? Japan has never even been a communist country. What is wrong with your brain?
@xXSuJuNo1FanXx 

duudee she was crying
NATURE YOU SCARY!
(ps - dolphins caused the tsunami)
@Lindawatcher laughing?
@UPRC Never tell anyone not to pray. Just tell people to pray and donate and do whatever else that will help...
@Lindawatcher Ahh, just checked out your channel.  Clearly you are one fucked up human being.  Make sense that you wish misery on others.  
@Lindawatcher You have no soul do you?  They are clearly in a panic.  
@wheetypeedy Don&#39;t pray. Donate.
@juriaguria no one was laughing. It was screams and yells of horror.  People makes different noises when faced with a horrendous event as this one.  Its a vision most have only seen in the movies but in real life, its numbing.
your life is being destroyed right before your eyes your country and the people. So overwhelming to the eye the mind is hard to comprehend.   Turn and trust in the Lord and he will give you rest.  Praying for you Japan
本当に？！やばい。。。

To those who heard people laughing in this clip, nobody was laughing. I hope your mistake is purely your ignorance, not to get a rise out of people.
@Karcia007 yes i can really hear the laughter and the joy in their voices as the water level rised.

are you joking me??!?!? there was a woman crying and this old woman wimpering/screaming at not knowing how to react and being shocked.
no sane person would be happy in that kind of a situation.
Budda bless Japan... :( 
God bless all of you :(
o kurwa..
@Karcia007 
They were screaming, not laughing!
@zoma1330
Yes, but people around the camera seemed to be really excited. And they probably laughed.
&quot;oh look, there are corpses flopping in the water!

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&quot;

... wrong time to have fun ...
You must be strong now.
people of Poland supports you in those difficult times...
@Karcia007
it sounds they are screaming in this film.
O JA PIERDOLE
It&#39;s scary. I don&#39;t know why people laugh in this film... But we are with you! 
頑張って!!
Hard to imagine anything more frightening.
God in help,Japan !

why was this one the comedy category?
...........
Woow i always wanted a pool THANKS :D
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
@stifler2x69 probably choosing category that is most popular to get views. its a good thing trying to get views as this needs to be seen more than say some &#39;comedic&#39; i&#39;m on a boat remake shit. 
desde Chile..... fuerza Japon
@FlowerCapitalTokyo: it means: hardly useless job. that means this is not very important video. if it would be recorded from roof, it would have given us &quot;bigger&quot; view on the situation, from this position, we can see hardly nothing
これ情報あるからまだ見てられるけど

Is she trying a kamehameha??
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Oh my god (despite me being an atheist). This must be a nightmare for those who see other people being swept away while they could do nothing. For the record, I &#39;Liked&#39; this video, but not because I like what&#39;s happening.
@keviar245 yeah i know, but it&#39;s so horrible. i mean look at all the damages it&#39;s not that i&#39;m blaming god or anything, just that..i don&#39;t know. hard to explain.

Why is this in comedy?
Water fast
 And heavy flow.
 Most formidable.

To those asking how this ended up in Comedy- to quote Mel Brooks, &quot;Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall down an open manhole cover and die.&quot;   Not saying I agree with this statement, just saying.
WHY THE FUCK IS THIS IN COMEDY?

お父さんたち大丈夫だった？

How the fuck did this end up in comedy?!
@Gyozomroka but there are 2 guys running out there. one at 0:10 and the other at 0:22
There must be some mistake - this is tagged as  &quot;Comedy&quot;. Must be because there is no &quot;Tragedy&quot; tag.
not funny
whhy is this in comedy?
oh my god. its horrible. 
Terrific... I had chills on my back... hope they are alive...
terrible!!!!!!!!!
UNBELIEVABLE!!!
コメディーじゃねえだろ(-_-;)
分類したの誰だ？
Is there more somewhere?
I had a dream about Japan and it was beautiful and what is happening now really is terrible. Fight bravely, we Polish people are with you. Dear Japan ...
@szezone it looks like the same guy going up the elevator at 1:15
@x0ticShwty It&#39;s how japanese people express amazement, like when we say &quot;wow&quot; or something
@PenguinCentipede it looks like the same guy running to the elevator at 1:15, so I think he&#39;s okay. Hope so...
@sakurajapanable I think she will be safe there. I hope you meet her again soon.
@hankko722 Different cultures make different sounds. In Japan, that&#39;s a sound of amazement, sort of like &quot;wow&quot;
so im guessing there would be no naruto this week......

pray for these guys that hopefully they can survive this tradegy that is going on to them
wishes from Poland. Hope it won&#39;t happen again...
Strongh and healthy to all japanese people!

@ConvoyGTR They probably couldn&#39;t even explain their feelings.
i&#39;m getting knots in my stomach watching this and thinking to myself &quot;this should not be happening! why? why? why?&quot; i can not imagine what those people are feeling at that moment. 
can the woman just please stfu...stop &quot;yeaaaaaaaaa~~~ing&quot;

why does she sound so happy?

OMG! I&#39;m in shock! I&#39;m praying for you from Venezuela.
@Froderic85 that&#39;s not the door, and i think its 2nd floor. hope both of them are well and alive.
HORROR....

九死に一生を得ていればいいのですが。
I am very sorry, hope your family is well
Uds. Sabrán salir de esta.
@Smudge4C Naturally, I agree. It&#39;s a matter of timing in this case. It&#39;s unlikely a rational criticism is really going to convince a religious person otherwise so to prevent them expressing their pain, in their own way and warranted or not, seems a little unnecessary right now. I also agree that is is a little odd to still hear the term &#39;prayer&#39; even being uttered by the US president (a supposed secular constitution) but I think we can let it slide in the name of the greater good.
OMG, at 10sec there is a man running outside.. is he alive???
悪夢と言うほかない。
My condolences.  Hoping for a speedy recovery.
T.T I so sorry
@superoshi what o_O?

Hermanos Japoneses espero que se recupere pronto mi pais Peru tambien sufre terremotos y tenemos que estar unidos fuerza Japon

stay strong japan
unbeleivable...:( my thoughts are with the people of Japan.
@deadlypalms thank you! 
@springbreakvacation They have real good food and you would live long cuz of healthy food and the small enviorment they have. If your not cluster phobic than I might recommend you to live there. Although 99% atheist is a weird statement, they do have buddhism and shintoism but they don&#39;t take it seriously (it&#39;s more of a trend or a tradition than a religion). 
@JDubs878 What are you, 13?
@schkwartz haha well we can&#39;t predict the future so.
So tell me again why people believe God exists?
the ignorant comments i&#39;m seeing on this video piss me OFF. how can people be so insensitive... idiots. I&#39;m praying for the people effected by this.
horrifying.
I am sorry for Japan, but I hope the disaster goes away soon
I am not a wuss or anything but I&#39;d be scared to death if I saw this.
@x0ticShwty lol i cant deny ur comments made me laugh the asian &quot;ayyyyyh&quot; lol nbut the thing is serious man!... they are scared as the shit, but yeah their noices are really funny lmfao
@swimfreak430 i fucking hate you
@mattmurray07 .. money didn&#39;t prevent it too.. but that does not mean that we shouldn&#39;t give them money now..
leave it to Reddit morons to turn a tragedy into a mindless debate about religion 
@deadlypalms There&#39;s always bigger things to think about - AIDS, malaria, starvation in Africa, violence in South American and Africa, etc.  Just because the earthquake/tsunami brought a new things to think about into the fray, doesn&#39;t mean things like the pervasiveness of religion should become less important.
I DONT LIKE JESUS ANYMORE !
@sur0x .................
This is how Toyota recalls in Japan
@sur0x 0:23 in the right, he used surf haha
Squirtle use surf!!!!!
Hey I&#39;m an atheist, but I know people suffering in Japan will be really encouraged to know that there are people out there who are praying for them. So your prayers are not wasted. It&#39;s a matter of emotional support. 
wow amazing
the aaaaaaaaaaaaa is like an expresssion of &quot;my god or geez or mannnn or even fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu&quot;
Wow that&#39;s scary.. we&#39;re completely powerless against such a force of nature.
@deadlypalms totally agree, but it&#39;s not just a beef with religion.  It bothers me when people say they&#39;re praying for the japanese because it&#39;s 90% not even legitimate, it&#39;s just like an automatic response to tragedy to make them look better and everyone else look worse. Hell, I bet most of those people aren&#39;t even praying.  Plus...and I should be careful here...but it&#39;s pretty much over, so if there were a time to call upon the heavens for help, I don&#39;t think it would be right now.
god, prayer, blah blah blah=bad answer to a bad question
SERIOUSLY SHOCKING!
@phillipsitbon never notice that. really hope the guy survive. why he never run into the building
0:22, lower-right hand corner, guy is running for his life. Hope he made it...
Impresionante ... K valor para las personas q estan alla.
what does the &quot;aaaaahhhhhhhh&quot; sound that raises in pitch that I kept hearing mean? it&#39;s not a sound that I&#39;ve ever heard in my own culture, but I heard it in multiple voices in this video... is it a word, or just a sound that means something like &quot;Oh no...&quot;?
aaaaaaaaAAAAAAAaaa
rararararararará
uia
aaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA
@nemetroid Assuming it will help might be more useless.
I hope the Pokemon factory is okay
they take it as a joke , should we ?
OOO aaaaawwwaAAAAAwwwAAAAAHHHH
@mrstone56 isn&#39;t donating to the Red Cross more useless than praying? Everyone knows (or should know) the Red Cross is corrupt. I&#39;d rather just send my money directly to a family or some business to use that money to deliver food and such to these people.
i dont think its to stop praying, i think its abt not praying alone. not relying on prayer as the only way to help the situation. prayer and be helpful as well. donate to red cross for example.
@ImAwesome00001 Haven&#39;t you heard of free will?  Derp derp.
Category: Humor????!!!
@mrstone56 nope, i&#39;ll jus continue my prayers thank you
arigatoooooo! SAKE BOMB!1
Devastating
@mrstone56 Not Red Cross, some other org. though
Now, im going to find out how I can donate to help these poor people. Because it turns out that people who may pray are also capable of donating as well. Who would have thought?
Why the fuck is every single comment on here bitching about praying? Does the entire Youtube demograph now consist of born-again 16 year old atheist virgins who&#39;ve only now just come to the realization that religion is stupid and so they feel the need to vent their beliefs online as if they&#39;re onto some sort of revelation? News flash, you&#39;re not that fucking original. Everybody with half a brain has come to the same conclusion. Go release your teenage angst somewhere else.
I will be praying for everybody effected by this disaster. This is so horrific. Nobody knows 100% why this happened other than plates moving. There is absolutly no reasoning behind people saying stop praying. Who do you think you are? You may say you are donating and that&#39;s fine. How about just stating how you are going to help instead of foolishly spreading your opinion on the internet and telling people to drop their faith. Leave it be. Act like a decent human. Mind your own business.
@FrankTinsley. Sure, but claiming something exists, and not being able to put forth evidence or reason behind your beliefs, that&#39;s a whole chapter itself.

I can say I believe that there&#39;s a Fanta-Fairy, you can&#39;t disprove me, because I KNOW IT IN MY HEART. Also, jesus was secretly an alien from Voxlor 5, you can&#39;t disprove that either.

Short, don&#39;t believe in stuff before you can back it up, else it&#39;s just a silly, childlike and fruitless punch in the dick to people &quot;reviving&quot; prayers.
@PhoenixKnight5 Nevertheless, if you make an statistic you will see that people who pray usually help more than people who don&#39;t.
@sapproizzad 

Well, praying didn&#39;t prevent the disaster, so why would it make a difference now? lol


@sapproizzad 

Yes, but the people praying are usually the ones that do nothing yet still say &quot;I helped with japan, I prayed!&quot; Instead of actually getting off your ass and helping. If you want to help the Japanese people, donate to the redcross to help rebuild and to deliver food/fresh water to those in need.
@doddilus People who don&#39;t like earthquakes and tsunamis destroying their city?
It&#39;s the Christian way.
@doddilus probably the people in the cars..
The stop praying comments are just as useless as the people praying. 
“Civilization exists by geological consent, subject to change without notice.”

Unbelievable...
Praying just to spite people
I&#39;d be scared out of my mind.
@karan8624 

according to someone in my family &quot;god is not helping, because &#39;people&#39; who belief in him will eventually go to heaven or something like that...&quot;  I still believe in science more than something/one that i have not seen
Often you can simply transpose the word &#39;prayer&#39; with &#39;thinking about&#39; or &#39;hoping&#39; - in which case, let people do their own thing to cope with this tragedy. 

It&#39;s comforting for some to know they are being thought about in such times - doesn&#39;t taking issue with religion right now seems a bit insensitive and tactless when there&#39;s bigger things to think about?
@mrstone56 Red Cross: one of the most corrupted institution in this world.... there is always a smart dude asking for money whenever is a tragedy
@mrstone56 Because people who pray never donate to the red cross as well right?  Another definition of praying is hoping, what is wrong with hoping people are ok?
@jrobbins324 That is horrible. I was brought to tears as soon as I noticed him. I hope he made it away. 
how can this be comedy!?
and praying is not useless just
as long that you actually do some 
actions its not useless! oh and how can 
this be FAKE!? 
omgee who ever thinks that ehem (@valante12)
is soooo STUPID! 
@mrstone56 
Even praying is more efficient than donating to the Red Cross.
Nothing fails like prayer..
I wonder will this video qualify for revenue sharing?
@Saar18 Oh no, you&#39;re right...  He&#39;s around the guy&#39;s shoulder that&#39;s right in front of the camera.  When he shifts around :24 you can see a guy running in the street.  Utterly terrifying.
godzilla making da secks with mothra underwater
@playstation3gam3r you must know nothing about God.
пиздец
@jmgarvin .. Its behind the cars.. look closely and also around 0:22 you see a person running.
@Saar18 I&#39;m not seeing this person, where?
At 0:10 you see to the right a person outside slowly walking:s... wtf why didn&#39;t you safe yourself:(???
Why is everybody saying stop praying? I&#39;m half-japanese and in Japan it&#39;s 99% atheist. However they do pray there to, and I&#39;m pretty sure that they would feel better when they know that we are praying. Ofcourse we religious people aren&#39;t dumb enough to just pray, we do make donations too. But Praying doesn&#39;t have to be religious or anything, it helps their spirits up.
@666RID I sincerely disagree with your statement. We christians believe in science also, or at least me. To me this is just the teactonic plates clashing each other. 
@sweetenedbuns It&#39;s because this video was posted to Reddit and all the r/atheism trolls have come out to play.  Militant atheists are every bit as bad as militant bible thumpers...and even more smug.
@itsbrentyo What you are saying is true, but the primary argument against praying in situations like this is that it gives people a false feeling like they did what they could.  Someone may feel like because they prayed they did their part to help out and then go on to do nothing. Praying helps the individual, not the problem, Donating to the proper organizations or volunteering your time or effort actually helps the problem, and praying does nothing in comparison. 
My prayers are with them, that&#39;s for sure. I hope every single person alive there is safe, and the dead be at rest. And I am NOT racist, but does anyone else think of a car going from gear to gear when they go &quot;waauhhhhhhhhhhhhhh&quot; &gt;_&gt;
fuerza japon!!! you people have to be  strong we already happen  through this last year. I&#39;m from chile southamerica. the hardest part is rebuild everything..
AHHHHHHHHHHH......
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhh.....


AHHHHHHHHHHHH....
Oh my God, seriously, you people are having this dumb as shit argument HERE on THIS video of all places? bloody hell, youtube.
仙台空港も孤立されてたようですが、うp主さんは無事なのでしょうか・・・。携帯からアップされたんですかね
@asorita1 reminds me of cloverfield :/ i guess cuzza the camera being handheld
Holy cow, my thoughts are with you Japan...
@IntoTheFace Well you dont need to go there. Just wait for one near your. And you see all your stuff and some of your friends washing away in the current. And you&#39;ll see how fun it is.
@EVILgnarlygnome Ah, spoken like a &quot;true christian.&quot; You weren&#39;t going to pray for Japan before because you couldn&#39;t care less for the suffering of other human beings. But now you&#39;ve decided to pray for them - solely to spite the non-religous?? If Jesus were alive today he would spit in your face.
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
@EVILgnarlygnome  After the earthquake and the tsunami, I&#39;d say Japan has had quite enough help from god.

Dear all - quit feeding the troll, kthxbai
Shit happens
aaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.....
@EVILgnarlygnome &quot;Just wondering because its funny how atheism which was a lack of belief in a god has become an active organised movement&quot;

Only because the actions of a theists as a whole impede on the rights of those people who would otherwise be religiously apathetic, to the point where these apathetic people MUST organize and mobilize to preserve their right of freedom FROM religion.
@TheJason0018 Yeah, thats gonna take the wave back. 
Praying for them while GOD sends them an earthquake, a tsunami, some volcano eruption, and a nuclear alert? Are you kidding me? You fucking pathethic religious people...  Take your religious shit out of here, they need help from the humanity, science and technology, not your lame ass prays to an inexistent  vindictive god. 
@jwdcadle
It must be so easy to be holier than thou on your pedestal (sofa) behind a keyboard, but if the people handing out aid and medical supplies on the ground choose to call themselves missionaries, who gives a damn. Quit being so preachy. I don&#39;t think the people of Japan care about the religion of the people who go to help them or the views of an internet troll on those peoples religion.
pray for japan
I wonder what car insurance is going to cost now in Japan!
@Immi yeah hes not
i saw a person walking on the sidewalk some seconds before the water came in :&lt; i hope he was ok. this is so sad.
This is such a horrible and scary video.. really captures the sheer disbelief that these people must have felt when this disaster struck. I wish Japan and all the coastal communities the best for the future and with their reconstuction 
I just can&#39;t belive this&#39;s happening....a real tragedy
@MrPlaidBunny That is not true. ANd is irrelevant anyway. Secular charities are already helping along with religious ones and you cant generalise about who does and who doesn&#39;t donate. Generosity and compassion has nothing to do with your religious beliefs - just to whether or not you are a decent human being. All that matters here is that a lot of people are in trouble in Japan. Who cares whether or not those helping them - in whatever way they can - &quot;have religion&quot;?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
@feenostrineeks yes he did
aaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa
@supernathan2008 

Religions have no grip on the US? Over half of US citizens are young earth creationists! And he&#39;s hardly a plague upon society if he&#39;s giving money. BTW, I have never heard of a &#39;holiday tree&#39; only ever a christmas tree. And the sexism and homophobia in the middle east is based on religion, although it could be strongly argued that it is based on a misinterpretation.

I agree with why you are arguing with this guy, he&#39;s being a dick, but I disagree with all of your points.
@chaoshax14 

I agree with you. Religion doesn&#39;t deserve respect (but I&#39;d say religious people do), and people accusing you of &#39;hatred&#39; for not liking homophobia and sexism are idiots, but this isn&#39;t the time nor it is the place.
I just saw a right-hand drive Sklyine GT-R go by...noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

all i wanna know now is, did the dude running down the street at 0:22 make it inside?
@Whopzer Perl &quot;Harbor&quot; was an inside job, just like 9/11. 
People: rather than arguing, please donate for them !!! Yes praying helps nothing !!! Please donate for the recovery !!!
@chaoshax14 wtf is a &quot;pedal stool&quot;??  Not one to use mere grammatical quibbles as the basis of my argument, let me add that you don&#39;t know how much I give or what motivates me to to do so, so why don&#39;t you mind your own damn business?  Instead of criticizing someone&#39;s outpouring of support and emotion on youtube, you can go out and do whatever it is that you do to make the world a better place...and in turn, I won&#39;t sit around making smartass comments about the way you to choose to do so.
こわい　０＿０
Gosh.......this is so horrible I&#39;ll definitely cry insanely if i were there.........!! I have just donated. I think I&#39;ll donate more!!!!! 
@chaoshax14 Way to turn something that&#39;s intended as an outpouring of concern for one&#39;s fellow human being in a time of tragedy into an arrogant selfish exercise in name calling and mudslinging.  Your comments are self-serving and pointless, but at least you can go to bed feeling smug.  Congratulations fella.  You&#39;ve made the world a better place with your hatred.
@lonelymarker Having a computer with enough power, internet with enough speed, smartphone with ability to view/comment on YouTube videos, etc. leads any intelligent person to believe they have an extra dollar, at the very least, to donate.  If you can&#39;t even spare a single dollar, you probably shouldn&#39;t be spending your time on a friend&#39;s computer or the library.  Go get a job.  Get another job.  Borrow a dollar.  Ask someone else to donate.  Get off YouTube.
People visible outside the airport at 0:14 and 0:24, oh god.
@chaoshax14 Google Unitarian universalist
Please stop knocking people for &quot;praying.&quot; Nothing more pleasing than an arrogant athiest eh?
LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAA!
@chaoshax14 have you ever prayed? Really prayed? Or just prayed and didn&#39;t mean it?
I&#39;ll take Godzilla over that any day.
@stealyphil1925 And prayer to one&#39;s chosen deity doesn&#39;t preclude any of those things.  In fact, it&#39;s more likely to spur one on to contributing in some physical way, so get over yourselves.  We&#39;re all glad you have opinions.  That doesn&#39;t mean they matter...even a little. 
@randall814 Ehh.  Being able to access youtube doesn&#39;t really help determine if someone is financially stable enough to donate money to charity.  
@lonelymarker One of those will accomplish something.  The other will not.  If someone doesn&#39;t have the money to help then they should encourage others to do so.
@randall814 I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve taken inventory of everyone&#39;s personal finances.  No one told me the omniscient randall814 was on the case.  I humbly retract my statement. 
@lonelymarker If you&#39;re leaving that comment on YouTube, you have the fucking money to spare you dolt.
@Anonymous5125 Some people don&#39;t have the money to spare.  Others will do both, I&#39;m sure.  
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
aaaaaAAAAAAAHHHHH
@TamioxII Did they also take your English?
ここで知人が働いているんだが大丈夫だろうか・・・


Surreal.
The reason missionary will be there is because its easiest to take advantage of those most vulnerable, they want food, water and shelter, not bibles and a god who will torture them eternally if they don&#39;t believe.

@Anonymous5125 Can&#39;t we do both? :)
@jwdcadle religous organizations will host groups that send people to rebuild and donate a vast amount of money to the organizations why your entitled to tell everyone in a survey that nonsecular people will donate more if frankly bullshit. The key is to raise money to help the struggling citizens within japan and around the word. the label of being religous has nothing to do with it. What the fuck have you donated.... god dam dude NO PERSON i know waits for god to do something.... catholic here
@MrPlaidBunny Actually your wrong, surveys show that the most religious donate the least, whilst the secular donate the most, its generally agreed that this is because the secular realise the only way to achieve something is to stop praying and ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING whilst the pious theists wait for there god to do something about it deciding that a little prayer is all that&#39;s needed to make themselves feel better.
@MrPlaidBunny fuck off
@MrPlaidBunny 
I highly doubt that and I guess you have no evidence, either.
@MrPlaidBunny False and False. A large portion of Christain charities spend money on prosthelytizing which is NOT charity and the largest organizations that respond to these disasters are secular. 

And the first poster is correct, there is no correlation between prayer and increased well being for disaster victims.
@DJcaliban
Yeah, with Haiti being a first world country and all that it&#39;s obvious that the same will happen in Japan.
@Anonymous5125 like a billion dollars donated for haiti, remember?  how&#39;s haiti doing right now?
@lactosdog 
So what, are you going to fly over there and start pulling people out of buildings? How about you think realistically here for a minute. How about you fund the organizations involved with helping out in situations like this instead of commenting on youtube on how you think it&#39;s useless to fund the relief efforts. If you can&#39;t afford to donate, send a fucking letter or drawing to someone over there for comfort. Either stand up for humanity, or get the fuck out of the way.
I got all my frieds And I to donate as much as we could.:)
why is the catagory comedy
@rosalinadawn but if god is responsible for everything didn&#39;t he cause the earthquake in the first place? :O
@johan404 I like the part where you read what I wrote and made a response based on it. o wait
WOWOWOW... it must have been so scary being in that building. I wonder how long before they could leave.
@crazedUPfool 

And religious organizations are going to be working overtime donating and helping; but herf durf religious people don&#39;t help; they just pray.
the waves, i can hear them crashing omg. pray for japan !
@Anonymous5125 a realist, thank god I mean err, reality, for people like you. hahaha
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I&#39;ll just throw my money at the problem, that absolves me of all duties!
I&#39;m really dumb, am entirely ignorant of faith based charities, and assume all noting of prayers represents fullest extent of person&#39;s efforts. Hurf durf all they do is pray how pointless!?!?!

(when was the last time any of you hopped a jet to dig ditches in a third world hell hole?)
@weggles cause they’re not americans ;)
It&#39;s amazing how relatively calm they remained. People didn&#39;t seem to be flipping out 
@Yaghnam Good intentions alone won&#39;t help here. Please give what you can spare to the relief funds and encourage others to do the same.
DAMN TSUNAMI!!!! WTH!!!
@FriedSushi87 

It&#39;s not donations, it&#39;s trade agreements that let corrupt assholes remain in power while we take their starving people&#39;s foods and slap Dole sticker on them.
damn, one of the best videos i have seen, and ppl, stop arguing, not the time to do that 
Holy s**t! :((
Praying is like posting support in your facebook status.  It just makes you rid your guilty concience without actually doing anything beneficial.
@bunji1990 I didn&#39;t notice that before, hope he made it to safety.
I am crying and in shock. This is so terrifying!
Why I&#39;m a comedy categories

@BarkLabanWoof I don&#39;t think they are at all,  the fact is these videos are getting flooded by people saying they will pray for Japan, if you want to help do something practical and selfless: Donate to the cause. Don&#39;t act like you&#39;re making a difference by praying.
@Anonymous5125 You act like the two are mutually exclusive.
Terrifying
I&#39;ve always wondered what 500 people saying &quot;aw&quot; in unison sounds like.
holyyyy shit..... you can see a man fucking running at 0:22

Bottom right, on the left of the man&#39;s head. Watch for it.

Geez.. I hope Japan recovers well.
This is Sendai... The beautiful Sendai...
And this is certainly not of a movie.

My head is paralysed. This is too cruel.
Our planet is small and what happens in one part will affect others.
oh my god that was the scariest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. I really felt for the people in there - JESUS!! This is so sad. My thoughts are with our friends in Japan. Whats with people going to videos like this and posting rubbish arguments and hateful comments. It happens everytime. Some people need to get a personality adjustment.

The prayers and well wishes from everybody around the world goes out to the Japanese people and their trial.
