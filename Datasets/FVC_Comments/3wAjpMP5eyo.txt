WATER ON THE HILL!
CGI
This clip is dedicated to the 200+ people who went before him, miscalculated, and broke their necks üôè thoughts and prayers
Fuck me
A tu na pas compris grand

Physics teacher showed this to us in class one day, somehow this kept reminding me of a scene from It&#39;s Always Sunny
If this was new, it wouldn‚Äôt take that much skill to create in something like blender or unreal engine. However for being made 14 years ago, this is seriously impressive.
Who else is here for their projectile motion lab?
Someone show this to joe rogan
Brok: what the FUCK!?
&quot;Wait - I didn&#39;t die?!?!&quot;
Was this a stunt man?
Looking back it&#39;s so obvious it&#39;s fake
Is it real not any water
A good fake is worthy of watching
Mythbusters busted this.
It&#39;s All CG video  fake AF
Didn‚Äôt you learn anything from Muscle Man?
Is this real?? Holy Sh*t!! This guy is an absolute mad man!!
Well done!
Meh! This is nothing! I once jumped from the moon and landed on mount Everest! üòé
He is very lucky
Fake = losing fame
Do not try this at Home
Fake content is fine but label it as such pls....so dumb to pass off fake as real, but that&#39;s the norm these days
This was busted on myth busters  its all CG.
And note the pool itself on impact doesn&#39;t seem to even vibrate much less massive shift and sway to that kind of weight at that kind of impact hitting it. Even the air filled ring around the top of the pool appears unfazed/unmoved by his supposedly explosive entry Also I think his ass would be hurting a lot. lol.
eve kaneeve
Imagine getting the calculations wrong
Science how accurate lol
How did he not die bruh
I guess their school math paid off
any one know how&#39;s it done..
Evel Knievel
Discovery channel you have been warn...I&#39;ve seen this video
Original footage by yellowbusguy
Woo cool nice junp
That was my math teacher lol
How?!
I see the amount of comments: 2,666üëø
I wonder how many attempts before he actually made it?
Mythbusters busted this, can&#39;t be done
This is as real as 99% of influencers lol
Ain&#39;t physics brilliant !
How high is the slide please
Billions of scientists used, go create this useless but wonderful video
Good one..not
I kinda wanted him to miss
so fake but well done
This was the video that inspired Mythbusters
Wow!! That was fun!!
Is this video real?
Who else is here from mr. Beasts<br> video?
Who else come from the mr beast vid
Mrbeast anyone
It‚Äôs even more hilarious in the iPhone meme
Debunking comments aside, the scenery of this place looks really nice
It&#39;s almost as if he&#39;s going the same speed as the camera panning. Not maintaining his speed while the camera trys to match his speed.
Cool but fake.
I am here because of Mythbusters. It looks cool but also implausible.
He is a teacher at my school
I thought they were going into a lake and i thought thats enough, but into a kitty pool??<br>edit: Nevermind, I thought this was real üòÖ
It‚Äôs so cool and amazing how it defies all laws of physics!!
Balls of steel
Are you sure this is safe?<br>-Good, go to try.<br>*5 minuts later *<br>Oh, the test subjet died.<br>Good, who is the next?
Perfect physics
This is what physic teacher should&#39;ve given us to watch instead of work and power question.
I can&#39;t believe something could be so fake
That&#39;s not real. No way man
he speeds up after launching. Impressive fake but still fake.
That looks so scary!
I can&#39;t Believe he Actually did it üò≤üòµüò®üò±
this is fake for sure
That&#39;s fake-
it is so fake bro
This was one of the first videos I watched on YouTube. üòî
You could make a list a mile long that would be red flags it&#39;s fake. Even right off the bat...yeah two quick buckets of water would slick the slide down? Lulz
My science teacher showed us this for no other reason than why not
on mythbusters they say this video has over 4 million views but it has 3.9 ten years later is this not the original
my math class bought me here
This is like when i drop a long shot deuce in a public porter potty because I refuse to sit on the seat.
Lol he speeds up mid air its so bad and fake XD
That is so fake the jump tho XD its so stupid its good and its such bad editing also if he went from that height he would be dead bc this isnt minecraft physics
Still my fave
Who else 2020?
That is so cool but imagine if he/she misses the pool they will probably break a lot of bones ;/
Didn&#39;t Mythbusters prove it was fake?
2020 any1
Lmaooo
Still cool
Brilliant editing...üòÇ
Don‚Äôt you love how many Einstein‚Äôs are here trying to remind us it‚Äôs fake, even though it‚Äôs been well known since they day it came out.
If this were real they would have had a pile of bodies near the pool
BS, if it was real he would have broken legs, pelvis and neck. Speed + sudden stop = 24G&#39;s
Soooo fake lmaoopo
I mean, without any sort of video clipping analysis or whatever you&#39;d like to call it, it&#39;s pretty clear to see that his speed and angle would not result in that arc of flight, he would have dropped a lot sooner just according to physics. A good eye is plenty without much prior knowledge to prove this one&#39;s faake.
Fake
Sounds like a hornet
Amazing -  he goes down the slide head first, disappears from view for a split second then reappears feet first coming off the slide and into the tank. Wow, how he do that ??
faaaaake
FAKE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2019 anybody?
I watched in slomo still didn&#39;t see any cuts etc......
It&#39;s fake. If he were to travel that far in the air he would be going over 60mph probably more, (i&#39;m not going to figure it out exactly). That pool was less than two feet deep and 12 feet wide. At the angle he entered the water there would only be maximum 4 feet of water before he hit the bottom or the side of the pool. 4 feet of water means that his head and shoulders would still be in the air when his feet make contact AT 60 MPH! There are three things here that could take a 170lbs 60mph impact. The Earth, the pool and his body. The Earth will be just fine. The pool maybe could survive it. His body no way. The best case scenario here would be that he hit the water then the side of the pool which hopefully would fail and then he would skip across the ground, probably still being injured. If the pool doesn&#39;t break, he would for sure. If he hits the ground first he&#39;s dead.
Its looks so real even though it looks so fake aswell
I remember seeing this in fourth grade back in 2009
It&#39;s awesome
There‚Äôs no way this video is real if he lands slightly wrong he is dead and there‚Äôs no way he hit that first attempt
( fake ) but Would you beak some bone&#39;s doing a stunt like that
fake
IH MY GOD, DONE!!!
Blast Off! Ahhhhh Hoo Hoo Hooeyyyyyyyyyy
Newton‚Äôs 3rd law shows that it‚Äôs fake because the splash would go the opposite way of him not up
Nice CGI attempt, but pretty clearly fake.
I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS AS A LITTLE KID THE NOSTALGIA
2018????
No way that&#39;s real..
Was that film rekorded in 4k?
WOW COOL¬† AMAZING
hmm the water splashed, but why didn&#39;t the pool wobble as these pools are know to do so upon smaller impact or at the speed he traveled why didn&#39;t he hit or even burst through the other side?
what it would be like if CM punk won a fight in the UFC.
Don&#39;t believe...they would need more than 2 buckets of water for him to get enuff speed. Good fake tho
How does this happen!
Even it it&#39;s fake, it&#39;s still awesome.
Balls for days!!
Fake af
It was computer generated btw
a legend
Utterly amazing. I wanted to laugh but I was stunned üòÇüòÇ
This is the best video I have ever seen. Hands down.
Its onvious this was fake
What if he missed
Fake. It&#39;s funny if anybody else thought otherwise
ALL444HUAK5AR
Their ramp looks different then mythbusters
This must be fake
If you&#39;re going to to make a fake video, at least make it look real
nice
FAKE
How did he not get hurt the pools like 3 feet deep
fake
mythbusters are wrong it is real......
I love this
Yes, Still my favorite You tube video of all time.<br>Real or Not, There is a very good possibility its real !!!<br>I would not bet $100.00 on the first try though.
how did i never know about this
FAKE
this is fake watch mythbusters
Proven fake by Mythbusters
This is fake.
the actual guy had a rope on him before going down...and switched to dumy before jump.thats why it zoomes out....and then another guy jumps in the pool create a splash. &quot; edited &quot; you know what im sayin people....
cocain  is  a  hell  of  a  drug. ....
mythbusted
Wooden platform jutting out from under the pool with no cushioning on it . that would be highly dangerous if it wasn&#39;t a fake vid.
This video was proven to be fake and it was even on WatchMojo.com
Splash is too small for the amount of momentum he would have had - and given how he landed, he should have hit the bottom of the pool hard enough to break his back.
The direction that the water splashes, or in this case the direction that it doesn&#39;t splash is among the  the first clear giveaways it&#39;s fake
fake
If it was real, the pool would have moved or flipped
Looks real to me.
THATS SOOOOOO FAKE!
just seeing how he blasts off the ramp with no speed beforehand should show you it is fake. no mythbusters needed. no slowing the video down needed.
fake
And I know it&#39;s fake but imagine if it was real and he came short
Holy crap that was scary! What if he came up short?!?! üò®
It&#39;s not fake. That&#39;s just physics. If you can calculate distance, weight and everything else you are good to go
Given this is known viral marketing, and even described on Snopes, also there are some clues from the audio that are a giveaway.  (Use headphones.)  The bucket-water sound at the beginning is distant and panned center.  The sliding sound is a lot closer and panned left.  The pool-splash sound is panned center.  The cheering at the end is full stereo.  None of that makes sense assuming the mic is on the camera, is directional, and just swivels, as the first sound and the visuals suggest.  (Also there&#39;s audible clapping that isn&#39;t visible, even given any reasonable delay from sound travel-time.)
set speed to 0.25 you&#39;ll see it&#39;s fake
i WAS REALLY SURE THAT THE TITLE WAS &quot;I&#39;M SURE YOU&#39;RE GONNA WATCH THIS REPEATEDLY&quot; OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
You can tell after he goes off the jump he speeds up dramatically
Wfsawr
Why do u have to fake it. It now looks really stupid
it&#39;s cg but how the hell did they do it?
FAKE AS FUCK!
Busted on Myth Busters Not real but still fun!
what material is the slide
dat maths must have been complicated as!
wow
It&#39;s fake just watch Mythbusters
He leaves our sight for a split second, that&#39;s when the switch happens. maybe someone in a cannon or slingshot device?
It&#39;s fake saw it on myth busters.
lmfao...now that&#39;s funny.  especially the 2 kiddy buckets of water on the slide. well played mister wizard
Fakest shit ever. He wouldn&#39;t have gone that far first off. His ramp was built wrong if he was going to hit that. Wrong angle.
4,000
if this video isn&#39;t edited the guy was in the air for 2.25 seconds, the formula of physics calculate to 2.25 seconds = L of  83 ft or 25 meters at a speed of 10 m/s
Its impossible for someone to that far from a ramo with that altitude, just saying... Even if you reach terminal velocity...
im pretty sure Thats fake. ..
Trust me, everybody here is an engineer.
<br>This is fake because calculating the speed he was going the distance and the time he was on the ramp, this ramp needed to be bigger in order to pull this off he would also need to be going at a greater speed
You would need much more water poured from both ends for aquaplaning. In a real world, he would have been severely burnt from friction.
THAT IS SO FAKE LIKE REALY
Let‚Äôs attach some reasonable numbers to such<br>a flight to calculate the velocity with which the man would<br>have hit the water. Draw out a figure that indicates the launch and<br>landing sites and includes a superimposed coordinate system<br>with its origin conveniently located at the launch site.<br>From the video we take the horizontal flight distance as<br>D  = 20.0 m, the flight time as t  = 2.50 s, and the launch angle<br>as theta(initial) =   40.0¬∞. Find the magnitude of the velocity at landing.<br>Answer = 19.5 m/s. I think that would hurt.
mythbusters said that it was CG
This is fake science even proves it. Just look up newton&#39;s laws of motion
GAKE AND FAY
its fake
You will get a broken bone
Ha
ITS NOT FUCKING FAKE IV DONE IT BEFFOR IM NOT DEAD ITS REAL NOT FAKE GET THAT IN TO UR THICK HEADS
Wow
Not sure why everyone thinks this is fake
livin like larry
BAD ASS, I WANNA GO !
Fucking awesome calculated

Kto od AdBuster&#39;a ? :)¬†
even if fake, mythbusters tried that in a lake and showed that you can actually jump from the ramp and land many times in almost the same place, which should be located around 20 meters away from the ramp. If in this video the pool was located half of the distance, that jump would be possible.
What if he missed?
If it was real missing the pool would result in a broken neck or back which most likely would equal to certain death
))) –§ –ï –ô –ö ...üòú üëè üëè üëè
What a great edit! I can&#39;t find the video-stitching myself!
Just like regular show
Faaaaaaaaaake!
Ok only say fake if you have a reason. Don&#39;t just start commenting FAKE without even knowing why!...
Quit saying &quot;fake&quot; everybody who gives a crap if it&#39;s fake was it entertaining? Yes. That&#39;s the purpose so shut up we get it
It is fake trust me 
This isn&#39;t fake
If you needed mythbusters to tell you this was fake, well I have a prime portion of the Brooklyn Bridge I&#39;d like to sell ya. Great investment for the kids.
Its Fake.Mythbusters confirmed it.Just common sense also,at that speed and height if you did land in the pool you would go right through it.
Fake...
Damned fake!!
I wonder how long it takes someone to make a good fake video vs. how much $ they actually make off it??? ¬†Is it worth the time and effort to hope it goes viral?
Myth busters did a replica of this and said it&#39;s not possible to do that 
I am not big on saying it is &quot;Fake&quot; on youtube. But I just don&#39;t buy this one. There is just too many variables for the math to pull this off.
I am glad women do not think like boys...  

just enjoy it for the sheer spectacle
was fake
it is fake the guy who made the vid was on the ellen show and he said it
o2 quiz took me here
It&#39;s math<br>
Lol, too fake to be true
Who cares if its fake, still a great video!¬†
DJ Mike VECCIA TAKES Men&#39;s ball sacks in the DJ Boooth
Thats SO REAL
This is real

People fell for this?
As if someone would risk breaking their back/neck to....it is a good fake though
Precise aiming ! Well done!
One wrong move and kersplat! He would be dead!
—Å–Ω–∞–π–ø–µ—Ä
Gelogen das is nicht wahr
Even without nut blisters you can see this isn&#39;t realistic. 
¬†OMG! Did you just see that! Bravo to the &quot;Balls Out Crew!
Lol, I was watching Mythbusters and this is a fake xD
Mythbusters bought me here! And it&#39;s fake
L U C K Y <br>
Ugh... they assume no knows anything about physics.
that wuld of hurt to know where to put the pool
Mythbusters did it wrong. Jamie and Adam made a smaller, narrower slide with a short run and an even short ramp. they had to open their hands and legs to stay on their ramp. This jump is SPECTACULAR. Well done, dude!
Awesome 
Omg thats sooo awesome!!! id be soo scared to do that!
So fake
mythbusters bitch slapped this with its bust hand
I choose to believe this is genuine and if it&#39;s not, it still looks pretty good to me


Like he switches from head first going down the slide, to feet first before he launches... fast man so fast... 
no, it&#39;s not actually. Son, do you even physics?
Ya think so??
Cmon Son!!  Fuck outta here wit dat bullshit!
Not real
Cheers!
Your argument is strong.
true, but he accelerates even after he leaves the ramp which is impossible
They proved that it was fake on Mythbusters
It&#39;s not &quot;fake&quot; as it was never intended to be &quot;real&quot;:
snopes.com/photos/advertisements/megawoosh.asp
Would not be hard to calculate where to put the pool as long as the speed is correct.

physicisist
No way is this fake.
the haters gona&#39; hate

your on myth busters.
sanat
All I have to say is FAKE
fake
Would be Great if it&#39;s Real, but it is a Fake.
If that woulda been real I think my head would have exploded
fake in 0:11

I did that, thats easy
Mythbusters called the guy who created this video... And the guy who created this video confirmed to mythbusters that THIS VIDEO IS C.G......(SPECIAL FX)... So that being said anyone thinking that this video is real is a MORON.
BS
Thrill seekers have an insatiable appetite for the potential of danger. Plus the Mythbusters found out it was edited post production.
yeah, but it&#39;s still an awesome video.
thats fucking insane
seriously i am watching the show right now and i wanted to see it agin

dude this video is so fake
Even my grandmother can do it, just throw a doll in a pool where you are underwater, that&#39;s easy, but I enjoyed it that much.
if you want proof go to Netflix Mythbusters season 8 episode 4
mythbusters
 says this is fake
How did you build that. Also that is dangerous
some nerd having fun LOL
lol I thought you were joking, those asshats at mythbusters thought this was real?
Something like this could work. It would take a lot of time figuring out the slope of the hill, the person&#39;s weight, the length and height of the ramp, and the distance between the end of the ramp and the kiddie pool, and probably a few other variables I haven&#39;t thought of. But it is possible.
Who cares if its fake or not just watch it and shut up
LOL That Fake ... next fake video on YouTube.... 
xD that&#39;s insane
THANK YOU
ok people, we all saw the Mythbusters episode where they proved this video isnt real, but that is not the point. The makers of this video made such a fantastic and convincing video that millions of people watched it and even a major tv show took a look at it. I say it&#39;s  damn good based on those credentials. props to the makers 
Clapping is coming from the people standing next to camera man...duh.
Where is the clapping coming from?
so fucking fake !!

but mythbusters isnt always right

Fake
Fake as hell
he died
who needs mythbusters to see that?
it is fake it said on mythbusters
true i watch the ep. too it is busted

Awesome
CoolB-)
Wow
It&#39;s not fake
Fake and gay
Theres a fucking line or wired next to him cant ya freaking see it its on the left hand side
What if he doesn&#39;t fall into the water ????

-.- everyone can see its fake and i can tell how: to get that so perfect they would have to try many times and i dont think anybody did that excep a man whit parachoute 
Nope fuck haters this shit it totally LEGIT!
The man is hooked by a thin black woke that you can Barely see right when his body is off the ramp and the reason he is in the water soo long is because he is in hooking his self from the wire
the landing is computerized too
This is real we watched a video in math class about how long it took them to get the right speed and angles
math A+
Tiny waterslide+grown man = wings

Seems legit =)
dang so awesome!! this has to be a world record or something 
mythbusters said that this is busted
No way this is real. No. Fucking. Way.
Myth busters are lucky. They get paid for flying 32 ft on a slip n slide! So not fair!
No way.  Impossible.
maybe if they put the slide from the very top of the hill and grew a pair itll be possible

I thought this this nigguhhh was gunna die
Haha mythbusters did an episode over this video, the makers of this video told the mythbusters it was fake just to k et everyone know
seems legit
OK ???
I saw this on ministers as a viral video
I know this is fake, but if this really did happen... What will they do if he missed the pool?
Sir Issac newton calls bullshit, the angle of the slope x the speed of slider, add in the lack of dish soap = FAKE
Cool
Wow how can people fall for this its fake
No doubt fake
Fraud
should have wore a go pro
so obviously fake. I can&#39;t believe how gullible and blind people are
Mmmmmm fake!
how the fuck did they calculate that
anyone else realize that there are no dislikes on any vids?
no wonder people called my 50ft slip n slide the &quot;death slide.&quot;
It can&#39;t be awesome when its fake
Awesome!!!
Bulls Snit!! Fake
FAKE! Snopes reveals it to be a Microsoft software advertisement on how to make fake videos.

Ughh he didn&#39;t die i dont like this video Lol
That looks sarcy
Correcting people&#39;s grammar online really isn&#39;t worth your time, is it?
Myth stupid
*they&#39;re- you sound like a hick.
mythbusters called the people who made this video and they said its FAKE, it was used using special effects...
Bull shitttt
Watching it on mythbusters
Their obviously hicks
Tack
It&#39;s called the imagine cup.   It&#39;s a technology competition for students and pupils. Myth busters  should have done some research
There&#39;s an error
this video is fake!
What if he missed
Microsoft made this video with software honestly its not real
Check out my channel. I have a really cool stunt video that you all should see. It is my first video.
There is no way that is real but it is amazing
the mechanics are all off... when they guy goes out of site, is where the slip n slide ends. and the camera probably stops. They they launch a dummy into the pool. stop the camera again and out pops the guy... its easy once you know that at the velocity he was traveling there is no way he would have hit the pool.
how?please tell me
man,.... i knew it was fake. haha 

If you look closely , you can tell its fake
mythbusters, here plz! 
ok yoda whatever you say

EPIC 





FAKE!!!

Fake
Fake or not that was a good watch I replayed it several e times
Myth busters tried it. Bu only halfway. The doll they tested the scale model with is the answer . Both hosts kept the legs spread, and arms dragging on the sides to &quot; keep straight&quot;. Both came of ramp crooked. If you watch the doll in the scale model. It came off straight without steering. So while this vid may be faked. The myth busters came up short. Anyone who&#39;s gone down a mega slide knows the fastest way down is not rag doll with arms and legs out. The best way is arms crossed over chest,
fake but still hilariously amazing on how good you edited it! lol
Almost Absolutely NOT True!
That would hut if he missed
man if he missed......
They succeed with the power of Physics... 
mythbusters
The myth busters already reveled the truth
The
what are you talking about
Its called entertainment.

Wow..crazy
hey...hold a second. Is it bcoz of my imagination or does that man in vid look like a hitler?
fake...go myhtbusters..!
Mythbusters DENIED!
why does this video have a measly 3,000,000 views...it deserves better.
FAKE ::: they did a did this on mythbuster the same jump but only got not even half the distance lll ::))
clearly u think you&#39;re crafty, when by initials you put my full name. Funny guy over here^. Have a nice life
Drunk not may i be. But like man that is wise shall i talk.
talk like yoda you do even though drunk  you are not?

That&#39;s a bad ass pool
Hit &quot;3&quot; once in a second..
FAKE.
Riefsneider u actually made everyones iq plummet from that comment. Haha
Dr Evil: Gentlemen...I&#39;m about to go the moon. 0:11
fake and gay reported channel for child porn.
wtf thats crazy
Do you not know I was fucking kidding..?
I watched it on cnn live so yeah... he sky dived from 24 miles up. he took i hightech capsule up there and jumped. his name was felix baumgartner
his name was john carter
Woah, totally epic bro.
lol nah dude it was totally real. NASA just asked red bull to help them design a new space suit.
Someone once told me that they knew a guy who was in the civil war and somehow transported to mars and found a total colony of people warring with eachother as well as green aliens with 4 arms, but then he came back to earth and tricked the therns into thinking he was dead just so he could go back to mars......totally real
No, I swear, someone told me that they knew a guy that knows a guy who said it&#39;s fake, so it must be fake.
what? the felix baumgartner/red bull one? i beg to differ
Hey, did you hear about that dude who jumped from the stratosphere? Totally was fake.
nice try, but fake
He seems to pick up speed mid-air at the 0:12 mark.
FAKE AND GAY
soooo busted on mythbusters!! LOL!
FAAAAKE
Brilliant illusion, he was already in the pool
Do that i can. My beer here hold.
why at the start he went down head first then jump in mid air feet first????... their is only one explanation for this...time travel 0_0
Entertaining video
i hate people who have to come out and just start screaming about how fake it is. dude&#39;s, stfu it was totally awesome and who cares if it is fake, i mean really? The best response there is, its a waste of time....browsing videos on youtube, what precious time, wouldnt want to waste that! Totally sick vid.
its fake, look the velociti at 0:10 ... he decrease, but when he jump the velocity is other..
my school made one of these today,
trust me its impossible to go that far/fast
Yeah, youre like the 100.000th to use that comment. -_-
NO SHIT
@charlotte smith But it is
Iv seen that. they use soap and these guys use soap its fake. but i feel like with actuall lube this would work. cause i was thinking of making a slip and slide with lube.
no problem xd
hey! this is my brothers sergant from college!! it&#39;s NOT fake!!!

Obviously everything is fake unless its proven by myth busters :/
Not hating, just informing. I freaking love this video. They did an excellent job.
Fuck mythbusters.
its not fake it the guy was connected to a zip line 
Unfortunately you can see the editing cuts where the person was replaced with CG at the top of the slide. Good attempt though, would (and presumeably did) fool alot of people, until the Mythbusters got ahold of it. :)
Ha lol its impolible chek the mythbusters they &quot;busted&quot; the myth!
its quite clearly fake, u can see it through his trajectory, doesnt look natural at all
Wow
If only it were true....
Pretty sick
Great CG job.. 
Why you got to hate?
Hahahaha for everyone saying it&#39;s real, it&#39;s not. I&#39;ve seen how they did this in another video they made on one of their websites. The guy has a bungee cable strapped to him to pull him down the hill, when he&#39;s in the air he is edited in with standard animation, and at the end there&#39;s another guy already in the pool and just gets up. They did a freaking good job though.
its real, you&#39;re going to learn the physics on how that happend
In the first s seconds look how fake the slide looks.
That&#39;s not fake. That is 100% real.
mybusters did this and it is impossible

fake

not at all real

Or they could&#39;ve used CGI...which is exactly what they did.
this could have easily been faked. they could have used a dummy and as soon as the dummy hit the water, the guy could have jumped out of the water. but the fact that he was moving in the beginning of the video before he slid makes the video real... 
FAKE
FAKE

Fake
I saw this on myth busters its totally fake
His face said it all: HOLY CRAP, I DIDN&#39;T DIE!!!! =D
am i   the only person here  that think  that this  could  be  done ?

i think mythbuster got it wrong
lmfao
Hey ya&#39;ll, watch this!
its fake jordan...
2 CHAINNNZZZ
Wow this is incredible!!!!
This is why you take physics
Mythsbusters tell us that&#39;s a fake -.-

Mythbusters proved that this was fake, as well as contacting the creators of the video, it&#39;s CG.
There is / was a training jump and pool at Whistler&#39;s Blackcomb somewhat like this setup and maybe a bit more extreme for ski jumpers to practice on in the summer.  I believe they used water ski&#39;s instead of snow ski&#39;s.  The pool was a bigger.  This video  is more fun to watch though as it makes it seem that it is something that folks less than elite athletes can do.
Fake
Totally fake man
This was a stupid idea!
It&#39;s real
This is fake. Myth buster busted this. Was told to them its CG ( computer graphic)
Mythbusters busted this myth :o its not real
FAKE WOW
FAKE
That must have felt amazing (fucking scary) but amazing
holy shit
no i dont believe you.
i was expecting a lake so i was like WHUTTHEFUCKGRASS?!

Ferb, I know what we&#39;re doing today.
So thats how they keep getting to my country
Obviously that&#39;s fake, but is very funny.
Mythbusters already busted this. It&#39;s done with CG, the creators admitted it.
id believe it more if there wernt sound effects

@EpicHeroSandwich He does belly flops. The surface are of his flat body slows him sufficiently, must bloody hurt though:/
I dont know it just sounds like your being negeative, sorry, gosh. I did&#39;nt know you get mad so easily.
It is not my opinion, it is a fact.

What part of &quot;I have seen how this video was made&quot; do you still not understand?


I &lt;3ed it!
Well your putting them down and very well might be real
Nope, not negative, It isn&#39;t real. I have actually seen how it was made!

How exactly does that make me negative ?
Your so negeative!! Maybe it is real, maybe it is&#39;nt!!\

Perhaps it&#39;s Superman fucking with your head.

This video is not real, it has been debunked many times. If you still choose to believe it is real anyway who am I to kill your imagination?
there&#39;s a guy who dives off 20+ foot platforms into inches of water. and it&#39;s legit. in the record book. explain that?
Cool editing
Sinusoidal
and you are stupid
Fuck you george, always being a debby downer on cool shit like this.

what are the chances of that?! thats bullshit! for as fast as that persons going and hitting the pool that hard, the pool would have popped or tipped over! 
Suicidal 

If it was real, there wouldnt be 500 people running up to him.
Anyone that feels the need to point out that this video is fake, is an idiot. Of course it is! Don&#39;t assume other people on youtube are as stupid as you are. 
IMPOSSIBURU!!
Fake
bull fucking shit
SO FAKE!!!

mythbusters say this is fake..
Thats not fake or anything
FAKE.
Real or fake who cares thats fucking cool!
Fake!!! But totally awesome!
Holy crap i want a turn i want a turn!!!!  Lol
Its real not fake I&#39;m next
„Åì„ÅÆ„Éì„Éá„Ç™„ÅØÁ¥†Êô¥„Çâ„Åó„ÅÑ„Åß„ÅôÔºÅ
that&#39;s crazy i cant believe hes not dead.
I beleive it. This is rad as fuck! my turn...
These guys have a multi-million view youtube video. All you have is a comment that makes you look at a jealous jackass. 

well played sir. congratulations
Its not a photo sohow can it be photo shoped
Holy shit!!!! How far did u go???!!!!
I tried this at home, guess what? I died
I made a snow jump almost as big, man salute
Shit
I used to believe this, then I took a mythbusters to the knee 
you are stupid if you think this is real
F to the A to the K to the E
&gt;&gt;Iantheiguan Ya I was there, and it is. It was part of a German commercial. Yes, it is possible to land in the same spot, but not to fly in the air 115 ft. Tested by Mythbusters it is only possible to go approx. 72 ft.
Mythbusters said it was fake
This is definitely not real. 
Even if they somehow managed to crack the physics to make it possible, he&#39;d still hit the water hard enough to break his ass on the wooden platform holding the 2ft pool.
Guys this is real.
Dear santa,
Too slick to be true
that is fake if you dont remember
Holy shit!
fake 

freakin awesom
The myth busters busted this.
some water splash... NOT!
i do that before breakfast
who cares if its fake! its rad!

FAKE

fucking math geniuses!
Fake as you like

@FalseRank 

yeah...the members of the mythbusters crew are also the &quot;experts&quot; that said it was impossible to light a fart on fire......
thats alot of butter
@tayler606 yeah because the world is horrible enough without people who make kewl CG animations like this on. We should ban all videos that disregard the laws of gravity whether or not its real. Woman should get laid and think to themselves. &quot;My child may grow up to get on a water slide one day... I should abort it.&quot; There should be a law passed to prohibit this kind of thing from being posted on the web.

We can call it SOPA and PIPA.

I am sure we can count on your support &gt;.&gt;...
This is why we have abortion clinics
No acceleration down but major going up, fake
Fake and gay
That is sooo awsome
Kool no fake
@ManSocks1 Do you Watch Myth Busters because they are experts and they say fake.
haha I like how people say its fake but its really not..
@SleepyShippo and was it?!? 
crazy birds
Hahahahaha, FAKE
i saw it was good good job guys

FAKE YOU DUMB PEOPLE DO SOMETHING GOOD NEXT TIME 
:D
They used a dummy
No need to argue... It&#39;s fake. Mythbusters tried to recreate it and couldn&#39;t, and then they called the ppl who posted the original and they openly admitted that they faked it...

Just enjoy the damn video, bc the shit still LOOKS amazing/real.
What if he missed.
step 1)  build a ramp.
2) effects and editing.
3) get a guy to exit the pool
4) get idiots to run up and cheer and hug him :3
Fake, off course!
But funny!
@Sonsum 
&gt;implying there is math involved.
&gt;implying you have any clue what&#39;s happening online outside of youtube.
&gt;implying you know math.
inb4 math major hurr durr
@normancelerian you had doubts?
calm the fuck down 

you have literally no clue what you are talking about, do you.
@Sonsum 
oh LOL
n gay
Who gives a shit if it was on mythbusters they admitted it was conputer generated so its not busted by mythbusters the creators told them so
This is fake it was on mythbusters.  They even asked the people that made this video and they said it was computer generated.
Any one see the dummy at 0:08 its by the ramp
Lol! Just searched this video up, cause of Mythbusters xD
watching mythbusters so what was fake about this???
Watching mythbusters lulz
Haha mythbusters
Watching it on mythbusters now too. I&#39;m genuinely hoping it&#39;s plausible!
Lol
didn&#39;t  really need Mythbusters to point our that this was fake.  DUH!!
@Sonsum 
?
Ok, so what video editing software did you use to make this?
Starts down head first, comes off ramp feet first.  ????
FAKE!
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yo i did the math, and this shit is fake.
they shoot the telietubies here?

Soooooooooooooooo faaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!!!!!!!!!!
Fake and gay...
this is a viral ad.
Wow How Cool , NOT . . .
wow they help so incase he falls why not put a huge wooden board under it that will break the fall
&gt;mythbusters

What if he missed?

@epicpae he just has massive ups

@MrPurple1178 If they played it in reverse than how the F*** did they show the Air Part.. Huh?
HOLY F***!!!!!!!!!
be careful
This ain&#39;t fake! Mythbusters tested this and it was plausible!!!
this is how engineers have fun
Okay traveling at 70miles per hour lets say.. impacting a pool your butt would be unconcious.. and the pool would have broken up. 
they already proved this to be fake
If you look closely, you see that right after he took off from the ramp, he had a big boost to reach the pool. Nice try MegaDoosh!
@DrTornadomagnet9 because they had good editors to make 2 seperate videos merge
fuckin hell technique 
@MrPurple1178 than when they threw the bucket of water why did it not go back into the bucket
o.m.g is real??
@LukeHappyFace i know right
Fake or not, still a damn cool video.
@MrPurple1178 Always someone who takes the fun out of a video.
i know R.Kelly cant, but he can fly :)
this is fake, it was on the news like 5 years ago.....
They probably used a dummy in the air and the man was hiding in the pool and then the man must&#39;ve jumped out.
he didnt even slow down after he came off the ramp. fake.
fake
omg!
@BKMWproductions 
i mean if he missed and smacked his head up on some rock then yea...probably
@teamrocketsucks 
Seriously, if he missed do you think that helmet was going to save him? 
0:11 Omg I thought that was the end of the slide Lol. 
Wtf. No way.
now what if he just missed the pool and sacked his nuts on the wood? most amazing credit card??
FAKE
At 0:20 Does the audience screams &quot;So Gay...so gay&quot;???
thank god for the helmet, otherwise it would been dangerous

@SparkydeFay is it busted or is it true, cause i&#39;m shocked :O   .
big deal, looney tunes did stuff like that but into glass&#39;s of water
wow&#39;


AWw I was expecting him to miss
what the hell was he thinking he could have died half way across what an idiot!!!
353 people tried this and missed the pool...
fake he ovbiously jumped backwards on to the slide and they played it in reverse
HOLY SHIT
Bull shit.
omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg 
is this real???

thats fucking awesome!
its a doll
@PlzDontKillDave It is fake. It was used for a Microsoft commercial in Deutschland.
So fake......
i wonder what he was thinking at 12
so cool
For those that thought it was a fake... ... it called physic... ... get the output speed then u can measure the distance the person will fly...
my friend did a jump over 5 chair beds then dived into the pool i thought he was gonna crash for sure, its hilarious, hope you guys enjoy it!
fake

almost tricked me but def. fake...
Unfortunately fake.
i would love to do this
fake...
They must of done their math
Besides, Mythbusters contacted the publishers of the vid and they said it was CGI (Computer Generated Imaging)
@edtemp71 Have to agree with you.  The splash should have been forward...
bullshit lmao i have to see that to believe it

@edtemp71 Ouuu ComeAtMeWithKnowledgeBrah!
@brodie9909 I&#39;ll try to explain in simple terms with simple words so you don&#39;t stress out your few working brain cells. Try this: Drop a stone in the water, the splash goes up. Throw a stone at an angle into the water, the splash goes forward, in the same direction the stone was travelling. It&#39;s that simple.
i wanna do it!!!
A decent fake, but if it was real the splash would have gone forward, not up. The guy came in at an angle.
That would of been cool if it was real!!!
fake

Who cares if it&#39;s fake it&#39;s a decent video.
This was busted on Mythbusters, don&#39;t remember what season
@Ch0c01at3Pr1nc355  I totally agree, it&#39;s fake as hell. no way in hell someones going to fly 150-200 feet through the air like that!
this would have been better if he missed..
Even Mythbusters said this was fake. What else need be said?
fuc ya

nicely done viral video!
Fake
Nice try, no way you can get that distance.
Not bad
Mythbusters :D:D:D 

its soooooooooooooooooo fake

awesome..
i sen this on mithbusters ITS FAKE
same thing happened in my backyard everyday
@hbk15111 who cares???
press four....ROAR!

who cares if its fake?! its still dope as hell!
@catzrule136 there isnt even a question about it. its totally fake and if you cant see it you are a dumbass
people whp r sayin this is fake, shut up cuz what if it isnt?
@ForgeableGamer  duh duh duhhhhh duuhuhduh duh way to fucking go captain obvious
Well they are in the mountains. The air is thinner so this could be a possibility to fly farther. I know in the Rockies stadium the balls fly farther because the air is thinner. I dont see any cuts in the film or hidden. When I snowboarded in Colorado I would go just a little further when i would go off jumps because of the thinner air. I grew up on the east coast where the air is thicker so i was used to a more dense air. I think they should go to the exact spot and test it.
Just Mythbusters couldnt do it doesnt mean its not possible.
This was on Mythbusters
@SovietBeatle1100 Cuz... Like...going to the moon... no math involved in that or anything... STOOPID AMERIKANS CAN&#39;T EVEN DUE MATH LULZ!!1!!!1!!!1
Loved it
thumbs up for 
HOLY SHIT
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah so fuckin awesome man u gotta admit that was awesome( im not soviet im usa)

so crazy! but if you want to see a funny slip and slide video check out the new Shortcut To Last music video, it&#39;s rad! 
R u guyz idiots  its fake do you know why, I know because i watch mythbusters doing the same fucking thing but guess what its a failur because when one of them slides all the way down the  same fucking hill and to a lake and when he slides down to the bottom he he didnt fly and fell he gos to the ramp and fell to the edge.
Im so annoyed that it is fake. I wanted it to be real so bad
He starts head first then hits the jump and magically turns around to go feet first? MIRACLE!!!
As soon as I saw the pool i was like WTF!!! Holy SHIT!!!
Stfu that&#39;s awesome!!!
its completely FAKE the man tied with a rope and he comes halfway down the ramp and gets stuck there with the help of the rope and rest is the work of visual effects and after he lands in the pool with the help of visual effects the real man is comes i the pool and stood up
so its purely FAKEFAKEFAKEFAKEFAKE
this is so fake it pisses me off. at least make it a bit more realistic looking so i can at least entertain myself with the idea that it might be real
you pretty much all readty would its so shallw
holy shit dude if you didnt land in that pool you would die
that was fake as hell

@shankelmo16 Still not fake though.
@ZJN09 Nope.
@MrZbrothers Not fake.
fake and gay
Fake fake fake. i bet if i had a computer geek i could probably make a video like that.
@BKMWproductions  Uh, probably because the jump he made was FUCKING DANGEROUS.  why do you think...
Anybody else wondering why he&#39;s wearing a helmet?
Whoever made this should really brush up on their physics. There is no way a 190 pound man could build up that much speed on such a small hill, or go flying so far. Also, next time add more &quot;impact&quot; to the pool. Water splashing was okay, but show some movement of the whole pool :)
Fake and gay..
I&#39;m gonna call fake on this one, but it&#39;s still awesome

FAKE!!!
this is so cool is it real OMG

Fake ?! O.o
Press F13 for the fail. Thumbs up if you looked.
@colwyn100  Nope Reddit.com guided me.
@Thedudewiththepiano I thought he said so gay

mythbusters proved that this is impossible

mythbusters did it its so fake

Mythbusters proved it was fake 2
Quite obviously fake.
Fake, Busted via Mythbusters.
jajaja super fake, just realize you don&#39;t see the guy through all the trip.
312 people didnt land in the kiddie pool lol
Mythbusted!
thumbs up is stumble upon brought you here
This was actually part of a Microsoft Project ad in Europe.
azta rohadt XD ezz nagyon kem√©ny XD graaat :D
when he was flying i said oh #%$@ weres the lake
Are you kidding me!!!!!

So, this is how @FreddieW got his start with VFX! It all makes sense now lol
 the two persons throwing water and they cheer afterwards????how the hell did they make it so fast to go near the pool?????!!!!!!!!!!!!you can see it with your eyes!!FAKE!!!!!!!!
@TheEstonianIdiot in the news reported as fake.
viral marketing gets really boring
Real...
its fake you butt

@rinoman19 no it is real!
this guys are like jack ass!!!
@ReVisedEnergy this made me smile haha. rwj
To everyone who says it looks fake, it is. There&#39;s another video showing how it was done. Mainly CGI.
Fake n gay
@Fenderprecision51 yea well i peein the middle to assert my dominance over you

Cool but fake.
Ik that&#39;s why I searched it
FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nice Try.


if this was real the splash has got te be much bigger :S
this is soooooooooooo fake
Myth busted.
FAKERS!
gotta love German scientists 
@SammyBob89 They tested it on mythbusters and proved it would have been impossible andddd at the end of the episode they said they called up the makers of the video, and the owners revealed to them that it was fake

so um yeah
Is everyone here stupid? If you had one ounce of intelligence you would know this is real. It was featured on 60 minutes a couple years back. Don&#39;t make assumptions unless you can back them up.
FAKE jkjk  thats amazing :)
@Fenderprecision51 finally someone gets me
sup

so fake its funny :D

Had he landed on the ground it would have been real!
Myth Busted.
@fake &lt;---- This
haha 0:26 handshake fail
And then this one time at band camp...
I like pie
Ah shit the lens cap was on gotta do it again
Obviously it&#39;s fake u fuckin trolls
Fake!
@lolololzorski lol dude yes it is u r fucking stupid to think its real
@rinoman19 dude ur as much immature as he is lol
@puregranite1 its alittle sumthing called editing dumbass
that was still pretty sick
It&#39;s a viral ad Microsoft did, man stop moaning.
These guys are naturally unemployed...
LOL so fake but so funny.
@rinoman19 not fake they prepare it with objects similar to his weight and size and then he does it!
I thought MythBusters,bust this video along time ago!
FAKE AND GAAAAYYY
fuck man how fake...
@orangetos maybe i don&#39;t care about it?  all you would have to do is measure the distance from the top of the slide to the end of the ramp, then you just find the speed that the person is traveling when he leaves the ramp....then you need to take in account the gravitational pull that is going to be put on the man as he travels, and you can easily see where v(s)=0.

or the easy way, would be to get a dummy that weighs the same weight as whoever is going to go, and throw it down the ramp.
how is this fake?? you guys r so stupid. look in the beginning at the top of the waterslide and theres no dummy. they dont stop the video and they zoom out and take the same guy and goes down the slip and slide. this is real dum dums
fake... real... just follow the link at the end of the video and you&#39;ll find out :)
that was real

ITs a fake, they told me

Thats how Chuck Norris takes a bath, in unicorn tears...
How on earth did they calculate the distance?
wow,fichissimo questo si che merita,ma soprattutto il tizio che ha fatto il progetto per atterrare precisamente nella piscina perch√® i calcoli non credo proprio siano stati facili!
@xfc04 last i checked, he&#39;s not moving STRAIGHT DOWN and he probably smashed into the edge of the pool.  you can easily calculate the distance he would travel and put the pool there....
it&#39;s very crazy

Yeah this is pretty cool but come on people.... you don&#39;t even need to know physics/see a dummy to know it&#39;s fake. Think about it- whenever you jump into a pool, how far down do you sink? Even without a diving board, you still go deeper than 3ft. Now imagine jumping into a pool from 30+ft? Even if this WAS real, the guy would have broken something or maybe even died.
I have yet too find a reason that would prove this not too be real!!! 
they probably used the dummy for tests... DUH i say its real
this is not fake. its one of my teachers brother done it for a uni assignment

its a microsoft promotional add? so its not real
Dude, the trial and error of that must have sucked.
it would be cooler if it was real
@GothicElite5021  it would be funny if this is real

FAKE. You can tell that the flying body was just a mannequin.
i hope none of u guys actually believes it&#39;s real. look at how he accelerates at the bottom of the slide, too fake to be true :P
i just about believed it was real until he landed in that small pool,i can see this happening but only in a lake.
@RadioactiveCoon id imagine thats what they used to know where to put the pool
FAKE

@skinnydiprog3r Lmao. Okay?
@gruzergrub5000  Yeah, didn&#39;t they mark it as &quot;Plausible&quot;? (can&#39;t actually remember)

ie The vid is fake but the stunt IS possible. Assuming you&#39;re dumb enough to try it... 8-S
The only reason he look confused when he got out of the pool was because he thought he was dead.

It&#39;s amazing how dumb people are on youtube. Everyone knows it&#39;s fake, that doesn&#39;t make it not cool. 
it was on mythbusters and they talked to the ones who made it, still awesome nonetheless.
@ieuan97 u are fucking stupid
@HannahBabyyGurl 

Fucking Troll
its a good effect but the jump is too long for the run up. he flys too far. apart from that it looks good

@sweatpants1231 Thank you for correcting me. 4 ft deep.. HE STILL WOULD HAVE DIED. 
Great photoshopped!
i want to say that this was faked but the reaction says that it&#39;s not .

They proved this was fake on MythBusters
fake and gay
fake this is an ad
How did you fly so high?
That is insane but cool at the same time.
if he missed...
FAKE AND GAY! There&#39;s no possible way someone can make it that far like that. And the way he landed in that pool, he would have died. The water in that pool has to be like 1 ft deep.
yup 2 buckets of water will do the trick

That Was EXTREEEEEME!!!
the mythbusters proved that&#39;s fake they actuly sent the presenters down the same sized slide and didn&#39;t go nearly as far
@santolman fake...
so, what did the mythbusters say? fake or real

lol

@Seventy28 

truee
hahaha still funny tho.....
this is not true beacuse Mytbusters try this and figure that that is a comoter generated

 DUDE I DONT EVEN THINK TRAVIS PASTRANA WOULD HAVE THE BALLS TO DO THAT!! JOB WELL DONE
guys this was a viral advert for the uk
Now that is what you call cool
I love it when everyone comes rushing over to him and he just stands up and is like 
IM OK!!
Funny!
umm MYTHBUSTERS proved that its not fakee 


Look again !!
Immposible
FAKE AND GAY!!! But still pretty cool!!!
They make it so obvious that it&#39;s fake. The decline isn&#39;t even longer than the ramp. In reality he never would&#39;ve slid so much as half way up the ramp before stopping and sliding back down.

Also, the ramp and the slide are not connected to each other
 :]
My turn!
@lidlurch thats stupid
fake :D
This is obviously fake. For 1. He went down head first and flew through the air feet first. 2. The part of the slide that is covered is covered only by blurred grass that was photoshopped on. 3. He would have really hurt himself. But it does look like it would be fun! lol
@thekoltrain94 *droolz* lol Naw.. you are sooo correct!... ;) ~Pct3ch~
@theafrodude22 Yeap.. I sure believe he does. lol ~Pct3ch~
@TzGwHiighZ your girlfriend can probably spell thought* correct though...
i mean..this technically is possible with all the correct calculations but if one little thing went wrong. ouch..don&#39;t know if i believe. if it&#39;s real those are some crazyass people.
@tanithcai its fake because i can hit the bottom jumping into my 7 foot deep pool... so they would die falling that far into a kiddy pool. seriously if your stupid enough to think its real im suprised you were even able to string words together in a coherent sentence and post it. Really im suprized you did more than drool on the keybord and forget why your were at your computer in the first place.
This is fake but it&#39;s fun to watch
@tanithcai Wind shearing, the friction co-efficient of the latex/rubber, temperature of the water, the wetsuit neoprene texture/temperature are all variables that are near impossible to predict. However it sure looks real :)
@Cartyy  stop bullshitting.... X.X


It&#39;s a good cgi effect that&#39;s for sure.  But it&#39;s obviously fake.
This cant be fake its on youtube
@Cartyy  lol
I think your wrong
This is real. i was there. Notice guy laughing hard at end? That&#39;s me! :)
laugh my fucking ass off      thats sooooooo fake        but gooood idea    it 
looks real 
ouch
all you stupid fucks are like my friend jony, a fuckin sceptic, just cuz this shit is to fucked up for to to even dream of, dont take the credit away from other crazy fucks by sayin its fake, ur all a bunch of cowardds hidin behind a screen if this shit is fake, go get some real shit to show us. bitch. 
fake
fake

I think this was Microsofts advert thing they did... of course its not real its just there for fun and it looks awesome. Good Job
@21Dimen No.  It really is fake.  And anyway, it looks really unreal while he&#39;s going down the hill.  The acceleration is too quick.  Shut up.
@sagexp696 

Glaubst du alles vom Fernsehen. Die k√∂nnten auch schispringen und k√∂nnten auch behaupten es w√§re gefaked weil von den mythbusters keiner 150m schafft.

Glaubst dass die Mythbuster in allen recht haben. du Glaubst wohl alles was dir der Fernseher sagt. 

@TzGwHiighZ wait its not.....awkward
Omfg guys take a look at his sliding and while he is in the air does it look like fake to you ? Those who are saying this is fake are dumb.
@weathin99 that actually is the reason
CG !!!!!!!!!!!!!
@weathin99 r u a whiteboy7thst fan?
it looks real to me??
@gagababy92 its cgi u can&#39;t tell coz of tha !!!
what?
Sorry, but i thought that was real. What did they use to make this?
@cutie9707 No shit haha
myth busters did this and at the end of the show they figured out it was computer generatated
Is that real
@icrywheniweewee just watched it they busted it. NOT REAL
@lidlurch thats funny because this video is fake. You my friend are an idiot

FAKE mythbusters proved it
this video is real. they tested it on mythbusters and it worked
is this real or fake?
Good BUT HATE TA BRAKE IT IT&#39;S CGI!!!!!!!!
Wow that is sooooooo cool
Anybody seen Xmas vacation?! Hahaha
This was disproved on Mythbusters. They contacted the people and said it was CG. The distance was farther than it should have been.
its CG
I belive i can fly!
Notice how he picks up speed at his body leaves the ramp
This is jackass
Fake
Wonder if that&#39;s an edit or if it&#39;s real? I was like, No freakin&#39; way when i first saw it. I thought he was gonna land in a pond or lake when i saw him in the air. lol 
whoa!!! he perfectly shoot on the small pool!
Mythbusters - BUSTED.
lol all my friends(1)  think this is real.....that dumbass
It Was CG
@Sergiu154 they went like 40 ft

Fake, but still cool
sounds like a fucking jet taking off haha
so fake! but it looks super sick, i liked it :)
Proof #1 this is fake, the impact would kill you. 
thumbs up if you think ppl should stop bitching for thumbs up...oh wait...nvm
tumbs if u googled slip and slide and u found this video XD
/watch?v=0a5zKCYs2YA&amp;feature=feedlik   &lt;-------- watch please and give a like =)
lol so fake
AWESOME!!!
I dont think it&#39;s fake.. If one of you guys think its fake, proof it !!
FAKE
fake, but waaaaaaaaaay awesome to watch!
@pecky143 u should look mythbusters idiot
if this worked out then it was based on some really clever thinking and REALLY good physics skills!
HAHAHA FAIL MYTHUSTERS TESTED THIS! it was faked and impossible to do, plus mythbusters got in touch wiht the makers of the video and made sure
That&#39;s so amazing!!!!!
how do u test it

I know the person who did this personally
mythbuster myth is that
Amazing man!
wow ...great !!!
Chuck Norris&#39;s son.

this is so fake but it¬¥s so awsome
this is fake and the mythbusters proved it :)
@rilz009 who cares if its fake... its awesome!
ist obviusly fake.
world recerd
faakkkeeee
its a fake
cool video but thats obviasly fake but looks really cool
@ridehonda929 Mythbusters had an episode about this clip. They replicated it (on a hill and lake rather than just grassy hills) and busted it. Whilst doing that, the research team were able to contact the original makers of the clip and it was all CG.
That looks so fake how its a little pool and he launches like 200 ft and lands in it just sayin but cool vid.
people can make it happen.with the right math and angles and shit they could easily do this.
@FingerBoardzKid ok then why does he supposably &quot;dummy&quot; able to move his arms in the air and bend his knees??
yes we know its fake assholes. but that is fucking awesome
@BaconismyBF no it wasnt man , university physicists get bored too

Remember you could rate a video 1-5 stars?

Remember the famous yellow subscribeÔªø button?

Remember whenÔªøÔªø the users controlled the siteÔªø and now corporations?

WEÔªø MISS THE OLD YOUTUBE

Whatever you non believer&#39;s i&#39;m the guy in the blue coat with the white hat &amp; i can tell you it was very real and we spent over 40 hrs in preporation for this stunt. and also we slid a dummy exact weight &amp; height as Jimmy&#39;s body 7 times down  the ramp &amp; nailed 3 in a row before we let Jimmy go down the slide.Think what you want it is real &amp; un-cut.
Well he is not fast enough to get that height and to fly that far! Looks cool but - c¬¥mon you don¬¥t REALLY believe in that?!?! ^^
@victorvega1000 I say what I want,hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
@TheBradburyfamily yes, they would, this is around a trillion times easier to calculate than getting to the moon.
fake and gay
@Trulsbk its fakeeeeeeeeeee
@Trulsbk nope! look at another vid of this and it tells u how they did this:D
i wander what happened if he falled 2 meters to the right....
@chrisdafro THAT IS REAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL!
Fake.
FAKE AND GAY!!!!! (i be trollin&#39;) 
STOP TROLLING
fake... but still funny hahaha
fake buts if its not thats the craziest guy ever
its been proven this is fake......but he would kill him self when he landed if it was real
this is the kindof crazy shit that if u copy u will die! hes lucky as hell he landead in the pool
Very good CGI.....  But it&#39;s definitely fake the angle of the jump is way off and there&#39;s no true way that the guy could get that much speed in such a short time......  Nothing but busted CGI
the power of physics
Holy shit this dude has balls
FAKE :P
Mythbusters busted this hahaha!
@fowad27 Yes it&#39;s fake, made by the company...Microsoft! Type Megawoosh Microsoft on Google and go to the first result shown, the Microsoft website :) 
About your question of what program they used, all I can say is that these guys know well about programs to get the best result lol. I thought it was real at first but then :(

Thumbs up to end the debate about this stunt, coz YES it&#39;s FAKE!!
So it&#39;s a fake? What kind of program would you use to make it?
Wow skill. How would they fake this
There&#39;s something about this that screams &#39;fake&#39; to me. 

Mainly it&#39;s the impossibility of the whole stunt, like the exaggerated distance (I don&#39;t think a human would fly even half that far), and the fact that the guy stays 100% on track, despite the lack of side barriers.

But also it&#39;s that telltale way that the people in the video react:  they&#39;re clearly acting. Like they&#39;ve gone through the motions dozens of times in rehearsal.
@MegaMouseSEC Yeah...even if someone was crazy/lucky enough to do this and land right, 2 feet of water isn&#39;t going to stop you from breaking your legs.
@zachj589 Yes within the last month or so they tried this exact stunt. It is on youtube if you want to watch it jsut search for mythbusters water slide. People say that they did it wrong but no matter how you look at it they busted this as fake.
@MegaMouseSEC When? Was it a recent episode?
Fake but awesome!!!!!
@GorgonTheMagicMan chuck norris was willing to take that chance. lol
my girlfriend gets wetter than the water that they put on the slide.  
Proven that this could not happen by MythBusters. Totaly faked.
Unlikely but genius!!!
FAKE

this is fake i saw it on mythbusters
