even the stormtrooper missed its fucking steps
Not only is are they not good with their blaster aim while wearing a helmet but also they step… aim..?<br><br><br><br><br>(Possibly fun but I don’t know how you would feel about it personally fact: stormtroopers are well trained, that includes shooting. The reason they cannot shoot well (aside from plot convenience) is because the poor visibility from their visors are screwing them over.)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=11">0:11</a> &quot;don&#39;t worry, I know force heal.&quot;
Where is this at?
I warned you about stairs bro i told you dog
Thus we witness the fall of the Empire...
This clip foreshadowed the fall of Star Wars quite well.
Average cosplayer
not only can&#39;t they aim, they also can&#39;t walk
Whenever your trying to act all cool to impress people:
I burst in laughter for 5 minutes
Daily life of darth vader
His helmet popped off like something out of LEGO Star Wars!
think of this video everytime I walk near southern cross haha
The Empire&#39;s Finest
Why’s he wearing a sock over his head? 😂
I find your lack of balance disturbing...
Guys this is fake
Joe Biden stormtrooper
Aren’t u a little fat to be a stormtrooper
Staged for views.
i feel so bad for this guy :(
This explains all the stormtroopers   <br>Eye problem
He fell
Nah
At least the armor did it&#39;s job 😂
It’s not just aiming they’re bad at, they also suck at walking down the stairs.
The armor did its job...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=5">0:05</a> with you every step of the way
Sigh. A symbol of Disney&#39;s Star Wars.
Looks like the armor wasn’t very protective after all!
That’s why you always hold onto the rail.
Me when I go to a new school expecting to get new friends but the girl tells me to install Tinder and basically fuck off. And I&#39;ve not been to school ever since for 5 years now
防具を着けていたおかげで彼は助かったが、防具を着けていなければ階段から落ちる事は無かった。
Damn, that looked brutal. Glad he&#39;s ok
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro like a lego man
they realy can&#39;t see
aw my lil bro used to replay over n over laughing so hard at this
bro refused to die
It’s been years since I last saw this video and it still cracks me up
I bet this is the same dude who bumped his head in a New Hope
Trying to walk down LGBTQ stairs as a straight..............
Joe biden as a stormtrooper 💀
&quot;Ayo the Pizza here&quot;
“You seem…unsettled”
At the he was wearing a helmet 😂😂
This pretty much sums up the Sequels to star wars
That&#39;s storm trooper aim in pain
You gotta give him credit, he got back up and walked away like nothing happened
Why is this so funny.
Is it just me or did i randomly remember thid video

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=13">0:13</a> how has nobody mentioned everyone saying “you alright” like 10 times
The force was not with him
Dude rolled pretty well. Probably got away only with a bruise or two.
It&#39;s the excessive plastic jumbling noise that gets me EVERYTIME.
&quot;With you every step of the way&quot;
that one storm trooper who can&#39;t even enter the battle before dying
DOWN D STAIRS
I thought it was animated
Well it was in character
Guy now knows first hand how much it sucks to be a storm trooper with those vision limiting helmets. Guess you can say that helmet is faithful to its lore.

Why does it looks like if it where a actual scene from star wars😂
I made a stop motion where the predator gets hit by a car,and rolls on the ground,and now I realize how similar it is to this
ayo da pizza here <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=5">0:05</a> <br>my ears burn
That&#39;s why you wear armor!
Lego breaking sound
Bro&#39;s helmet did not live up to its functionality
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fake">#Fake</a> You can see him intentionally lift off his helmet while he is tumbling.
Be honest, when was the last time you&#39;ve seen a Stormtrooper have a shootout on a flight of stairs in the original trilogy?
That made me laugh so hard
And thats why you use the handrail.
Esta bien el casco? Jajajaja.
Anyone know where the location is?
<b>Bwaaahahahaahhahahahaaaa😂😂😂😂😂 NEERRRDDDD!!!</b>-Me in the background if i was there probably
Ya pero esta bien?
That is why we were helmets.
Kind of annoying how you can tell it was staged
Ayo intergalactic pizza is here <br>Oh <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=5">0:05</a>
omori reference
Sucks that he damaged his armor. That shit ain’t cheap
This is a beautiful metaphor to describe the Star Wars series as of 2015 onwards.
I’ve made a few costumes and I am screaming internally right now.
Me falling downstairs be like:
Sums up modern Disney Star Wars pretty nicely.
Aparently aiming is not the only problematic thing about them. They can&#39;t see sh.t in that helmet.
The clatter and the fact he kept going down the second set of steps had me...<br><br>Rolling.
Pretty much sums up on Disney handled Star Wars these past years. It was good at the beginning, until they tripped and fell.
Nice aim trooper 👍
So this man swan in the water with a shark and then took a picture with a tornado and now he’s witness a selfie stick fight and also saw a storm trooper fall down the stairs after watching the Star Wars premier?
The Emperor of Disney had this Trooper executed immediately after getting on his feet😢
And remember kids, that&#39;s why stormtrooper armor was made.
The bottom of the stairs says “with you every step of the way” and they were literally with him every step of the way
And yet he still missed the stairs. 🔫
thankfully the Stormtrooper &#39;&#39;armour&#39;&#39; helped
That was hilarious but I really hope that guy is ok
Wow . . .  If only Evel Knievel had that kind of break away armored suit . . .<br> Might have saved a few bones.
luckily he had armor on 🫲😂
Thats not the step you were looking for.
Looks like the armor actually helped.
BLÖDMANN!!!!
I&#39;ll bet HE sure felt the &#39;Force&#39;
Well of course, you can&#39;t see see $hit with this helmet on 😂
Disney fumbling the great saga in history:
he had so much bad aim that he couldn’t even go down stairs without falling
Imagine this was in one of a movies 😂
Oh my god. 00000 is that funny ha ha ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha he he he he he he he he he he he ha ha he he he he ha ha ha ha
Technology japanese be like
watch in x2
Then he had to watch the Force Awakens. worse day ever
This is Star Wars in a nutshell. It started out great - and ended in pain and embarrassment.
This was more entertaining than the whole trilogy with Hayden Christensen
It’s like a premonition from the real Jedi force of what What’s to come for Disney after they joined the ASG score society and woke Agendas…. BEAUTIFUL
Only time a stormtrooper ever got up from falling down.
Stair Wars
Dude walks  away like I’m not going to acknowledge what just happened
Omori reference
Bro slipped like he was falling into the sarlace pit💀
Aren&#39;t you a little clumsy to be a stormtrooper?
Its a fake. It falls, but cuts to a humanless skeleton. At the bottom it turns back into a real person. Editing. There is a slight jump. Watch closely
More entertaining than 7 of the 9 films
my comment of &quot;do it again&quot; was deleted ?
Best star wars movie ever
Mind your head.
Probably he missed a step.
This is a perfect depiction of star wars since the first 3
What a fake fall
Down D Stairs strikes again!
I&#39;ve seen this video for fucking years and always suspected which stairs he was falling down, but seeing the &quot;Spencer Outlet Centre&quot; sign confirms it. This is the large walkway steps at Southern Cross Station in Melbourne, at the north entrance on Spencer St
good soldiers follow orders
Take that, Mari
Deliberate, based on him literally throwing his own helmet off.
Honestly, I was expecting him to miss every step.
Theres always a chick in the background screaming 😂
modern ragdolls in games :
he really survived the stormlock wow😮😮
No way The Force Awakens premiere was 8 years ago…
Use the face dude. Use the face 🤣
I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t choke on his own hair.
And thanx bro KING JESUS CHRIST ORIGINAL filming whole thing indtead of catching again..... take how it resonates.....love slide at end makes it more realistic😂😂😂😂😂7

Ow. <br>Thank God he had cheep plastic armor. <br>If he had actual Storm trooper armor he would be dead.

LOLLLLLLL
8 Years Later the franchise is dead.
At least he kept most of his gear,  the FriggN stunce
Consuming Star Wars content since Disney took over
Must have been on of the emperors finest troops. Like the legion on Endor.
&quot;I can tell from your worn armor that you&#39;re a veteran&quot;<br>&quot;Uhhhhh....yeah&quot;
What a chode
If they took those helmets off, they could probably see. No wonder they can&#39;t shoot right.
aaaand that&#39;s what a loser looks like!
It Was At This Moment That He Knew He Screwed Up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=5">0:05</a>

Luckily he had Plastoid Armor

The step he slipped in said &quot;With you every step of the way&quot; im dead.
aww god
Summarize Disney’s management of the Star Wars franchise without telling me you’re  doing a summary. <br><br>(Glad the guy seems to be ok).
Looks like the armor actually did its job for once

Well, you&#39;re certainly in chatacter.
Never gets old
Its okay, he is from Melbourne. Nothing of value was lost.
When you realize it’s time to grow up
That’s a deleted from Spaceballs
Pwnt
is the guy ok tho?
damn bro killed himself
The stairs that read “With you every step of the way”.
DID YOU SEE HOW HE JUST WALKED AWAY FROM THAT, HUH???!!!  YEAH!  EXACTLY WHY I WEAR MY STORMTROOPER OUTFIT EVERY DAY FOR SAFETY SAKE!
I could tell it was going to happen when he chose not to hold on to anything as he ran down the stairs for some reason. Hope he got checked out because he seemed knocked out for a few minutes.
Honestly, where would be without cell phone cameras? LOL
Atleast he had armour
2 things that can&#39;t use stairs<br>Storm Troopers    CL4P-TR4P
Vader will be pissed...
Omg
Back on patrol
Did the armor work?
How am I the first like
they even suck at walking down stairs
LORD VADER IS DISSATISFIED
Useless. He&#39;ll never be a Jedi, anyway...
Hilarious
When stormtrooper realises they have to aim their feet toward the stairs
Poor guy
The force is with him every step of the way
This is canon
The Force may be with you ..every step of the Way
That’s why there’s railings to hold on to
The little slide at the end 😂
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO

The farce is with him.
Putting his helmet back on to cry was such a power move
Sounds like Lego
For some reason this seems extremely accurate to Stormtrooper behavior
the star wars sequel movies expectations vs reality <br><br>happy the dude is alright
Salute to the troop for losing his life for us
Dam I know that shit didn’t feel good.
😭😭😭😭
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Stormtrooper armor really doesn&#39;t protect you from anything. 😉
Haha put helmet on backwards
poor dude he just tested his new stormstrooper armor i feel the pain for this man
Thank god that stormtrooper had that armor on.
LMAO dumbass
He broke apart like a Lego storm trooper 😂😅
Is that Joe biden
Someone used the force on him
The fact this was filmed in Melbourne kills me lmao every time I walk on those stairs I think about this video
Live long and prosper - The Hobbit
He was so much into his role that he even depictured the clumsiness of the Storm Troopers.
A bad omen for things to come.
So the armor does provide some protection.. hmm ok that’s cool .
I find your lack of hand rail holding disturbing
The EXTRA sounds😂😂
So they can&#39;t shoot and walk down stairs WHAT CAN THEY DO
&quot;With you every step of the way&quot;
Nice cgi for 2015!
Ofc he missed a step you know who he is!
Stair Wars
Err, Guys i think that was Tk 291 Other wise known as Gary.. Welp hes clumsy
You should have added the Wilhelm scream
Quick someone put his helmet back on!<br>😂😂😂😂
Well, at least we know stormtrooper armor protects you better from falls than blaster bolts!
The best I have fallen and I somewhat can get up
sounds like someone chucks a plastic garbage can down the stairs ;)
Sounds like a bucnh of legos clattering together
fake
Could be worse. He could have seen the Star Wars premiere.
“How’s that armor helping you now, plastic boy?”
Pov you played too much ragdoll
The gravitational force is strong with this one Luke.
God that advertising is obnoxious 😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=6">0:06</a> dude turned into a real Lego Stormtrooper after losing health
I hope that Trooper is ok because gawd dam that had to hurt.
He misses a step
Gotta use those guardrails, bro!
<b>DUALSHOCK 4 DISCONNECTED</b>
With so many turns, we already know why they have bad aim
He found a way to make dressing up in a Star Wars costume even dorkier.

The exact thing I thought was gonna happen
At least he was well prepared for the fall
Wow, right on his De-Naturizer...
He didn&#39;t fall. He got shot down
RAAAA MELBOURNE MENTIONED
Pure Masterpiece.
So thats what the armor is for!
&quot;With you every step of the way&quot;<br>Every steps:
An impression of Kathleen Kennedy in control of the franchise 😂
Crap! He was looking good too!
Imagine if this was to happen at Disneyland
Stormblooper.
He&#39;s not on the way to anything, they literally stopped to film this.
He miss step.
The way he got up and started walking thinking &quot;  that f**king hurt ffs &quot; 😂

The force is not with you😂
With you all the way 🫡

hey, atleast he was wearing his armour
Shockmaster is the first thing to pop into my head...Especially with the helmet coming off and him putting it back on and continuing.
So their stairs skills are roughly equal to their shooting skills.
99 Hp Dealted
😂😂😂😂😂😂 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=4">0:04</a>
I don&#39;t think I should be laughing this hard at this 😂😂😂
their aim is so bad that they cant even walk down stairs
POV john wick it was brutal for me
He was portraying how bad the sequels are in a physical aspect.
Aah shit that was bad
They see me trippin they see me rolling~
I&#39;m actually surprise he actually managed to hit something.
You know, I’m gonna be honest, I’m surprised that he didn’t break any of his bones when he was falling down the stair, it’s just… wow
i&#39;m sure he has trouble aiming after that fall.
8 years ago!
Given the rather obvious complexities of the situation, this outcome was....expected.
Great stunt
Great. They can&#39;t shoot straight. Now it turns out they can&#39;t even walk straight.
The force is strong with this 1
&quot;Sunny, join the Galactic Empir-&quot;
this is the exact reason why stormtroopers cant shoot perfectly
He missed the step.
Bro was falling for 4 seconds
Must of felt like a dik after that
MELBOURNEEEEE (i was exactly here)
it&#39;s ok he got protection 4 and unbreakable 3 on his armor
Stormtroopers miss everything except the steps on the way down.
this has me in tears 😂
Someone edit this with blaster
I just realised the ads on the stairs read &quot;With you every step of the way&quot; lol
This is at Southern Cross Railway Station, Melbourne Australia. No wonder he falls
ASMR
this is the only time in history the camera man has ever helped the person being filmed
Such a classic video-masterpiece. What a nostalgic wave
He’s fine he has armor on 😂
the stormtrooper then realized that he was on his way to the premier of the sequels, he realizes he was in the wrong uniform for the sequel movies and passes out from embarrassment, causing him to fall down the stairs
The great stormtrooper got serious injury from the battle, but he still win the battle and claimed his victory
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The stairs had inspirational quotes
He MISStepped
This guy is one of my favorite storm troopers ever.
At least he had the armor it probably didn&#39;t hurt that much
I kinda feel bad for laughing at him falling but it&#39;s so funny 😂
Pov: when you die in battlefront
Stairs: &quot;With you every step of the way&quot;<br><br>Stormtrooper: <b>*Fells down of the way*</b>
Just like The Shockmaster
Performance Art perfection...He perfectly captured the transition from Lucas Star Wars to Disney Star Wars.🐸👌🏻
Damn that 🐶🥸😎 stairs , didn&#39;t see it 😵‍💫
Dude should definitely go to the hospital after that and get checked out...<br><br>Oh, wait, it&#39;s America. Uh... walk it off, champ?
Everything was perfect, the way he fell, the helmet falling off, and the damage sustained to the armor.
star wars right now.... just falling and falling,
Typical Storm Trooper behavior.
Down D. Stairs strikes again
The music continuing after the pause is absolutely brilliant lmao
Lol
Some stormtroopers have bad aim this one has bad legs!
Some jedi in the back after using the force to knick this storm trooper down
I just can&#39;t stop laughing
Is he ok?
Oh god, the walk of shame at the end….
i feel so bad for this dude hope he did not get too fked up
Best thing Star Wars has done in a long time
We had no idea what the was a bad omen for
Bro sumed up star war pretty well
The steps insulted him”with you every step of the way”
Lol
Star wars animators furiously taking notes for future reference
the npcs spamming ‘you alright’ tho
The step he tripped on had the quote “with you every step of the way” written on it. It wasn’t wrong I suppose.
&quot;With you every step of the way&quot;
“Hold X to revive”
Stormtroopers always miss. Only this time he didn&#39;t miss a shot, he missed a step.
Jesus says, &quot;I am the way, the truth and the life. No man comes to the Father but through me.&quot; Turn to Him today.
I would’ve put the helmet back on too, from sheer embarrassment 😭😭
Average Southern Cross experience
I fucked up guys
Bro&#39;s walking away to find a corner to cry in. Been there after a fall like that
It was on purpose, he wanted his armor to look battle worn.
Star Dork. Limping to a theater near you.
Looks like Biden getting off of Air Force One🤣
😂😂
classic
Pretty good representation of the Star Wars franchise actually.
Good thing he had armor
I laughed so hard at this it makes me feel bad there was a guy inside there.
Tiene sentido los Stortroopers no ben bien por culpa del casco XD
He missed a step
No aim no eye sight
I knew as soon as the Storm Trooper started to fall that he was on a roll.   😆
That has gotta hurt.
this has to be the the least funny video on youtube
He Missed a step, Classis Storm Trooper.
Order 65
The plastic sound im DYING LMAOO<br>at least not many people saw.. a-a-and hes a stormtrooper so hes anonymous..
Men down &quot;toward the stairs&quot;
What the h is with these stairs. A message on every step??<br><br>CONFORM<br>OBEY<br>WE WILL WATCH YOU<br><br>Ffs
Can someone add lasers and explosions to this haha but I&#39;m sure that hurt that fall was no joke even tho it&#39;s kinda funny
Good thing you had that armour on sir
My life summed up in one video ! Just keep pushing! (:
That&#39;s what this Virgin deserves
That is a methaphor if I&#39;ve seen any
looks like he did it on purpose
looks like he did a stunt because laterally jumped forward and rolled
wtf 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He’s probably the same stormtrooper who hit his head in A New Hope
good thing he was wearing armor 😂😂😂
The Sequel trilogy in a nuttshell
he missed a step
omg the fast forward killed me
Stormtroopers even miss the stairs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=5">0:05</a> the legendary moment
K.O
The music picking right back up as he limps away absolutely killed me
lmfao fugg star warz
I knew that armor was useless 😂
Probably the only instance of a stormtrooper&#39;s armour being responsible for both risking their wearer&#39;s life and possibly saving it at the same time.
This is MY joker
At least he had the costume for protection
Palapatine: The entire Legion of the best troops.<br>&quot;Stormtrooper arriving in Endor&quot;
This represents what watching the new trilogy felt like
When you fall out of character literally.
Force push
Why did he lay there as if he died 😂
&quot;With you every step of the way.&quot;
THE armor protected him
Shout out to Southern Cross station in my hometown of Melbourne!
I don&#39;t know why this came to my feed but this is just clout.
Disney since 2019
He lost the high ground :(
&quot;This armor&#39;s useless!&quot;
That is why they never had to change from clones
No way the armor actually protected him 😭
ironically the armor worked better than in the movies
The amount of tears and laughter this created has convinced me I’m going to hell
Acting like a actual stormtrooper! 🤣😂

the way his helmet bounces off him
Lol that&#39;s SO embarrassing!! Haha what a total loser! An absolute twat, that one!! 😂😂
lol that sound of him falling down
I’m sure it didn’t help to improve his aim.
clealry a staged fall you dont keep rolling like that he would have stopped and clunged way before that
Real life family guy moment
HAHAHAH REKT
Bro has a mission to complete
His armor is made of The Empire&#39;s finest plastic, Vader spared no expense!
People underestimate how much armor can protect you. If he weren’t wearing it he’d probably be quite a bit more bruised up.
I dropped my Stormtrooper helmet down some stairs once and the black film around the bottom split and the jaw flew off. Get me this man&#39;s armorsmith!
“With every step of the way”💀
This wasn’t a coincidence, the force tripped him.
Storm Trooper Armor rating: -50 Agility and -50 Luck but +25 Strength and +25 Endurance
He&#39;s gonna be using handrails next time, I assume
Man thought that was Joe Biden for a sec
Fun fact! This video is fake. It was created by the Woolshed Company in Melbourne. Now that you&#39;re looking for it, at the start of the video the stormtrooper seems kind of off.
this is a stunt man lol
Should&#39;ve added in the Wilhelm scream.... 🙃
Didn&#39;t know Joe Biden ever put on a storm trooper costume.
Adequately trained storm trooper right here.
They shoot poorly and also walk poorly.  They don&#39;t stand a chance.
How it feels to chew 5 gum.
This was better than the actual movie😂
Lore accurate Stormtrooper
Hope he wasn&#39;t going to watch the sequels... 😢
Yep, they are here to cause destruction!💯
There would have been no shame in using the railing
What else can you expect from a group of soldiers who cant even shoot straight😂😂
And, as usual, the armor was ineffective as protection.
Foreshadowing.
Shockmaster vibes
Are you surprised? Stormtrooper healthcare package doesn&#39;t cover eye exams..
This has been happening to Star Wars ever since that premiere.
good thing he was wearing his armour.
Staged
Staged and fake. Gtfo you horrible person of badness.
He got up and walked away that’s s real trooper.
Of course, a stormtrooper has to even miss the step.
Bro pressed the R to Ragdoll button accidently 💀
someone behind him in the shadows: <b>force push</b>
Absolute Trooper.
can you fall up stairs? YOU FKING RTARDS!
&quot;I find your lack of faith...disturbing.&quot;
😂😂😂wow
As Ted would say, “I fell out of my suit when I hit the floor”
Stormtroopers always miss. They even miss the step.
I&#39;m fairly certain the armor is actually plastic, or at least supposed to be some form of plastic, considering the fact in the movies it looks like plastic and it&#39;s as useless as plastic, armor wise anyways
Increased his accuracy by managing to hit each step on the way down.
I actually thought he lost his head
More entertaining than the movie haha
this but a scratch
Using the force of gravity, Luke?
That hurt to watch
Sometimes foreshadowing is relatively obvious
He forgot to scream in his fall 🤪 !
It must be really hot in that stormtrooper suit.
at least he had all that armor to protect him lol
Was well protected... 🤣
I visited these exact stairs today. They are the southern cross station stairs at spencer street. I could see him falling down the stairs with my imagination. That shi is no joke lmao.
First time storm trooper armour has been effective
May the farce be with you.
Because he appears to be ok.. this is funny as hell! Hahahahahaah... the storm trooper suit probably saved his ass.
“I can’t see a thing in this helmet.”
idiot can&#39;t even go down some stairs
Such Balaam.
It looks like it was pretty cold from what people are wearing, so he had plenty of padding covered by plastic &quot;armor&quot; which would have actually made it effective. Probably why he didn&#39;t seem to be injured.
Tuberville trying on this years’ costume.
aren&#39;t you alittle short to be a storm trooper? 😂🤣
”With you every step of the way.”
can&#39;t believe how in character this still feels... really want to see this with a sound effect from the movies lol <br>jokes aside hope you&#39;re ok
Thankfully he had a helmet
I love how he made an almost identical Obi Wan Lego Star Wars death sound at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=11">0:11</a>
the only time in history of the galaxy where storm trooper armor actually prevented an injury.
You’re laughing. He’s falling down stairs and you’re laughing.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>😂😂😂😂
This Stormtrooper needs a haircut.<br>Problem solved
I&#39;ve watched this like 10 times and it keeps getting better.
Average day at Southern Cross Station
Looked WAY to clean falling down dem steps lol
That was a pretty bad ass fall.
This proves that stormtroopers doesn’t just miss their shots, but also missing their steps.
Someone should&#39;ve warned that Stormtrooper to beware the stairs of Southern Cross.
For the Empire!
Hitting the door was not so bad, actually.
More entertaining than the all the films
Armor protected him
I knew that Stormtroopers had bad aim, but by the Force!
“I can’t see a thing in this helmet”
southern cross
Thats gotta hurt.
He was so committed to his role, he missed a step and fell down to the bottom.<br><br>Now THAT&#39;S professionalism. He should get a raise!
Get rekt 🤣🤣
Hahahahaha!!!🤣🤣🤣
Biden in storm trooper costume!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Biden in a storm trooper costume!🤣🤣🤣
Biden dressed as storm trooper…😂🤣😁
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=5">0:05</a> it makes me funny
If that stopped him from making it to the screening of &#39;The Last Jedi&#39; or &#39;Rise of Skywalker&#39;, he can consider that a blessing.
The fact that the stairs said &quot;With you every step of the way&quot; makes this even more funny.
“With you every step of the way”
That stormtropper just hitted me off
Woah, that is a crumbling
Well, the armor is good for something!
The crumbling sound of every nut bolt 🔩 was marvellous.
At least your suit broke your fall lol
12M views, 376k likes ... wow ... ive got to film this for my channel!
I feel bad for laughing 🤭please God forgive me
This is basically a representation of the current state of Star Wars.
are they really with us every step of the way?
the empire really did strike back
That&#39;s the most durable stormtrooper i&#39;ve ever seen.
This is what Joe Biden envisions on a daily basis
Ooch😮
he could&#39;nt see a thing in this helmet
Move accurate! ✨ 😊 ✨
When you forgot your personal Jet Pack!
More like a Stairtripper than a Stormtrooper 😱
They do stairs better than they shoot....
the force was not with bro
the force was not with him
I was ok uh huh lets see it, OMFG IS HE ALLRIGHT, lololololololol
Someone must have force pushed him for him to eat shit like that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=6">0:06</a> <br><br>I love how not only his helmet flies off his body but it stayed in the air long enough for him to do a spin and hit it with his elbow making it fly even further
I&#39;m actually kind of confused if this is real or not because that fall looked pretty brutal even in all that plastic.
I know it sounds cottonwool but people aren&#39;t afraid enough of stairs, without the armour and padding a fall like this can cause horrific injuries and sometimes kills people. Known of a couple of cases of people dying on stair falls, and one of my customers needed hospitalising after a fall on stairs. It&#39;s basically like being hit really hard multiple times with a metal bar.
Top tier armor right there
<b>STAIR WARS</b>
I thought it was a transition lol
&quot;How do they see in these things?&quot;
Why did he just ragdoll for no reason? Lol
Am I Meant To Be Laughing At This? 😂
The force 😂
ayo the pizza here
The Omori fandom has entered the chat
Ooooooooops
Good thing he was wearing armor to prevent any injury.
How does he get back up after that😂bro is a real soldier
This the First time a stormtroopers armor saved a stormtroopers life. 😂
I like how the armor probably helped prevent the sharp impacts on the way down
I actually feel mega bad for this guy.
Yep thats a stormtrooper alright.
His Stormtrooper spacial awareness game is on point. That&#39;s a committed character actor.
I&#39;m hoping that armor had SOME padding to it, it would have taken the worst of the fall.<br><br>That looked painful though. Hope he&#39;s okay.
Stormtroopers are notorious for being bad at aiming. But whilst it was unintentional, that joke hit hard.
NERDS !!!!
Ians Chat: that vid was us by meme in tank fish new update doors
those trash helmets the emperor made standard is what tripped him!
Probably the fakest fake tripping I ever saw.
I’m literally dying of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=5">0:05</a>
This one clip was better than the Disney sequels.
This is the meme that i did not expect it to be funny 💀💀💀
I kind of hope all of that plastic actually helped protect him
Star wars the fall awakens
First time I&#39;ve ever seen a Stormtrooper hit anything.

That happened to me after trick or treating as Darth Vader.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=5">0:05</a> <b>Wilhelm scream plays</b>
Someone use the force to make him fall
What’s even funnier is he looks like Solid Snake and walks away in shame. Poor guy hope his pride not too wounded, he made a lot of us laugh.
I’m dying at how his helmet and chest piece fell off 😂. Is this staged or legit?
He&#39;s been watching too many videos of Biden.  But  you&#39;re not supposed to fall down the stairs, you&#39;re supposed to fall up!!
The empire strikes back
Luke!  I detect a disturbance in the Force.
I love how the music cuts off then restarted right when he got to his feet.
😂
Now that&#39;s a winner in all senses of the word.
That’s gonna hurt
Stormtroopers does indeed miss everything even the stairs with their feet.
Stormtrooper: Why Did I Have To Wear This Armor It&#39;s Literally Useless Others Got Shot And The Armor Didn&#39;t Protect Them
FEEL THE POWER OF DOWN D. STAIRS!
Like a champ!!💯
🤣He should&#39;ve used The Force!
&quot;The fall&quot; has become his life, his identifier among those of his peer group and something he must laugh about ruefully or be deemed a poor sport, even after 8 goddamn years. The bitterness mounts, the structure of his life thrown into disrepair due to this one damnable event.
I came here to laugh but I literally gasped<br>That must’ve hurt
bro i tripped while taking out the trash in june and i broke my leg bad and i&#39;m gonna be able to walk again in 2 days. but this guy does this and just gets up
The railings are there for a reason.
Ouch……that’s gonna leave a mark. 😊
He missed a few steps
IT WAS NOT ANIMATED THE WHOLE TIME?!?!?
Bro be tripin XD😂😂😂😂
Thank god he’s ok
Its not the fall that hurt ...its the sudden stops over and over and over......
That&#39;s Melbourne, Southern Cross station! You can even hear &quot;you alright, mate?&quot;
FOR THE EMPIRE!!!
That’s some stuntman energy right there.
Damn this is hilarious! Of course l hope the stalwart Empire soldier only suffered minor contusions.
If he had been carrying his blaster the sights might have been knocked into alignment.
Surprised that he even misses the steps?
they walk as well as they shoot I see.
Awesome stunt work there, bro. Absolutely awesome! 🤟
May the gravitational force be with him.
Yup...<br>it was the same guy<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja4v-qiFvBg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja4v-qiFvBg</a>
Hindouche
Always keep your helmet on when falling down a flight of steps.
A strom trooper losing his helmet is instant dismissal from the Empire.  He left to join the Resistance.
Oh my……he may never be able to have children now…..wait…..never mind.  Not an issue. 😂
My older sister after piano and violin recital
Finding out this video is not real but just a video made by a company for publicity be like:
Disney Star Wars summarized.
Disney Star Wars in a nutshell except he is still falling
What a looser hahahah
😂😂😂😂
I think this is script and not script for 1 his head did not hit a single step so he most be a stuntman 2 i think he was going to fall on purpose but misplaced a atep and fell but went along with what happened
Sums up the whole franchise.
man those storm troopers always trippin
omg. i need that. Ty.
Fake.
Oh I’m hurt oh
He missed that step harder than he misses rebels
May the force of gravity be with you.
At least he had armor to protect him.
Damn Ewok snipers
That&#39;s what happens when you grow your bangs too long and they get in the way of your vision...  get a haircut 😂
Wow! what an incredibly average stunt
So, he… he missed a step
It’s such a perfect fall, mesmerising wow
At least he&#39;s good enough in aiming 😂😂😂
Stormtrooper walking is not so far from his shooting😂😂😂
Good thing he was in uniform!
Ngl this had me on the floor
such a dude thing to not hold the handrail.
i am ashamed at how hard  I Iaughed
The force was not with him
Poor guy,thats not funny
Fucking nerd😂😂😂😂😂😂
How feel you?
The armor and the helmet protected him.
I sense a disturbance in the farce....
That was funny, how he disassembled himself.
Someone should add vfx of a blaster hitting him before he falls
When you walk down some steep stairs with ski boots you could fall like that.
I felt a &#39;slight&#39; disturbance in the force...
Ed 209 didn&#39;t do any better either.
These aren&#39;t the droids you&#39;re looking for 👍🤣😂
why would you fast forward through the fall… garbage content. 0/10 and downvoted…
Good stuntman
So that&#39;s what a Stormtrooper would sound like if he was crushed in the trash compactor lol
It would have been better to play the imperial march when he got up😅
I fell down my basement stairs just like this.  Halfway down, I forgot how to walk and I went knnes first all the way down.  Broke 2 toes and bruised knees. 😂
I laughed so hard
This is how I felt while watching The Last Jedi.
&quot;I can&#39;t see a thing in this helmet!&quot;
Storm Trooper missed the step like he missed his target.
Are you stomtrooper
There&#39;s guide rails on the stairs but of course Stormtroopers are not accustomed to such things, OH&amp;S is for weakling Rebel scum.
I would&#39;ve loved to have seen this in a Star Wars blooper reel!
premiere of what? observably not a popular premiere
Oh God it’s like the ShockMaster all over again (just look up ShockMaster debut and you’ll see what I’m talking about)
Why did i hear nothing but bowling pins as he fell down the stairs?
yikes! high quality costumes like that are around a thousand bucks now
That’s what you get for taking the gay stairs.
It’s only funny cause he’s in a storm trooper outfit 😂
Storm Bloopers.
Off camera- darth vader hated latecomers, he moved his hand and it caused the tumble.
I was just at that stairway at Southern Cross last month and remembered this video.
stormtrooper can&#39;t even hit a stair...
WOW that was FUNNY!!!!!!!!!
Remember, COMPNOR kiddies: THIS is why we wear armor! <br>Plastic armor.
Priceless!!!
I hate it when that happens.
Faaaaaaaaake
Went all nine yards for a realistic depiction of a Star Trooper (1977-1983 style).
poor guy! that looks painful
just like the sequel trilogy
Not an Ultramarine...
He is a professional stuntman. Don’t try this at home,<br>kids.
That&#39;s what happens when woke Disney takes over
I hope he&#39;s ok.
Well his day is ruined
Vader won&#39;t tolerate this.
Ouch! I think his &quot;armor&quot; did provide some protection.
“Lord Vader, I was wondering if I could get your autogra— Son of a bitch!! Sh!t!! Fu— ahh!! Gawd damnit!!! Oooouch!!! That’s gonna leave a mark!!!uuuuhhhh **moaning sounds**.”
I’m not ashamed to hold the railing.
Fake.. but i appreciate it anyways.
Metaphor for the entire franchise
He ‘fell’ on porpoise.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😢😢😢😅😅
Fake
Good job he was wearing that amour.
Need the Eastenders ending music here
I hope he is okay. But that was funny, sorry
This is basically ‘The Last Jedi’ in a nutshell
Stormtripper
When she says &quot;Aren&#39;t you a little short for a Stormtrooper?&quot;
Who else watched many times? 😂😂😂
I got secondhand embarrassment from that 😳
Ummm.... Now he still, OK???
I think this trooper imbibed at the cantina ....
He walks better than he shoots. <br><br>It’s a joke folks - actually, there is a good theory about how the Stormtroopers were told to miss the main characters on purpose because Luke and Leia were so important to the Empire. There are plenty of examples of Stormtroopers actually hitting things, so it kinda makes sense. A different take on that is Vader used the Force to deflect all those shots, but that seems a bit of a stretch to me.
at least he wore protection :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=5">0:05</a>
Terrible acting.
Stair Wars
Trooper Brandon at your service!!
the force is incredible
Play this entire video @ 0.25x is fucking hilarious even more
What makes it even better is that steps actually say: &quot;We&#39;re with you every step of the way.&quot;
It is better to fall down the stairs than to let the empire fall
Stair Tripper.
The force is weak with this one (KIdding aside; I hope he wasn&#39;t hurt.)
Good stunt!  The camera was in the exact correct position to catch the entire thing, keeping you completely in-frame for the entire stunt.  Good thing they weren&#39;t surprised and missed part of it.  It&#39;s almost like they knew exactly where to stand to film the whole thing correctly.  Very nice!  It was also incredibly fortunate he had all that padding under his armor.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=5">0:05</a> he didn’t trip, he just switched to Ragdoll mode
You cannot over estimate how humiliating that was.
LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! retard grow the fck up!!!
Me when I&#39;m scared to perform in front of kid and then I tried to purposely trip myself so I could don&#39;t want to perform.
All I hear is yoda saying “how embarrassing”
He&#39;s now seen the light and will no doubt join Luke and the Galatic Federation of Free Alliances  🌟🙏🌟
😂😂
The empire&#39;s finest
I wouldn&#39;t want to sit in the seat of a movie theater for 2 hours wearing that.
The movie was a flop too.
“Can’t see anything with this helmet on!”
Taking &quot;head clanker&quot; to the next level 👍
did he die?
At least that armor is hard enough to protect him.
How is there not a wilhelm scream?
The FORCE was NOT with him.
Makes me wanna grease up a tarped hill with Sunlight and fire on one of the suits.  You get less scratches that way.
to vysvetluje vsechno :D
Bro it sounded like a toy falling and being dismembered XD

Not surprising..... as this is the same stormtrooper who almost decapitates himself on the Death Star blaster door in A New Hope.
can somebody add the wilhelm scream, please.
This footage would be perfect for a YTP. Just reverse him going down the stairs. 💀
Luke was right about the helmets.
Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes.
Its okay. We didnt see that.
Must of been wearing a &quot;Made in USA&quot; suit.
I fall a lot. I need to finally give in and get some of that armor. 😂
The last slide...😂😂😂😂😂😂
he had armor he’s fine
FAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE
I fell like that once but it was a little different. I was going up when i fell and i slid down the stairs. Broke the pinky toe.
DORK
The part where he fells off is better than the stormtroopers aim
I saw the whole thing, a Jedi force tripped him!
:looks at stairs: &quot;Traitor!&quot;
That black woman at the end looking at him like, &quot;White Stormtroopers, ... never would happen to a Black one&quot;.  LOL
Weeeeeeee🎉😂
Star wars: The stairs strikes back😂
Those stormtroopers were pretty vulnerable, as I recall.  One little tap from Luke&#39;s laser and they dropped.
Use the handrail noob
he missed the step
Maybe he was blasted
The armor couldn&#39;t even take stairs.
Obviously the Force is not with him.
When nerds think they&#39;re cool and an unforeseeable force reminds them of how cringe they truly are.
I hope he was ok besides his pride - I felt so sorry for him - broke some of outfit but, as long as he ok - I mean sure he walked / hobbled it off but, Im sure that had some aches an bruises as well shaking you up inside. Gutted.
well, he hit more steps then enemies!
(1) men do not wear long gear that’s for women<br><br>(2) do not worship any other false gods before me<br><br>Break our FATHER’S commandments and you get what you rightfully deserve.
He even made the lego death noise at the end lmao.
Every few years I gotta give this a go.
stormtrooper misses the stairs
I think thats the first time ever this suit protected a trooper from an injury :O
Yep, those helmets are an absolute nightmare when it comes to seeing anything not directly in front of you.
I love the sight of stormtroopers falling.
Can someone locate the stairs in Google search
Playing characters as an adult is more humiliating than falling down the stairs. Sad people pretending are funny.
Man became a lego.
Is anyone surprised he missed the step though?
Unsolicited free fall
Alice in Wonderland, in Ohio
Is he okay?
Giving Darth Vader some entertainment. 😂
Sooo, they can&#39;t hit anything AND they can&#39;t walk down stairs.
That&#39;s what happens to grown ass men who dress in costumes.
The way he slides across the pavement when he hits the bottom 😂
He is no way a real storm trooper ... Not one trooper in the history of star wars ever got back up...
Don&#39;t know how Han Solo made the shot but damn Han can shoot them from anywhere.
bros near southern cross station and spencer street outlet😭
Did he die?
Storm Tripper.
this is basically a metaphor for the Film Industry as of August 6, 2023
That suit looked like it helped 😅
YOU HAVE FAILED ME FOR THE LAST TIME!
On the bright side he had armor on
It&#39;s a metaphor for the sequel trilogy.
What a trooper.
That&#39;s generally how it goes for the dark side
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow, a Trooper with functional armor.
Heart warming to say the least.
Brought to you by AGL…With you every step of the way!
Poor guy
This is funny as hell can i use it for my videos
Go on don&#39;t break character
The Empire Stairs Back
Only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise...falling down the stairs
This was his first accident. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja4v-qiFvBg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja4v-qiFvBg&amp;ab_channel=SheriffMahgnitton</a>
Honestly, that pretty much sums up the disney Star Wars movies.
Hahaha oh shit
bruh the music edit 😂
Apart from never shooting straight, they are bad on stairs
HIS ARMOR BROKE!!!!!
I hope he had a nice TRIP <br><br><br><br><br>See what I did there 🤣🤣🤣
:P
Use the rails!! Don&#39;t rely on The Force.<br>I hope he&#39;s okay.
He did not find the stair he was looking for
Not only are they bad it&#39;s shooting blasters but they have a hard time walking down a flight of stairs😅 how did the empire ever get so far? They must be no stairs in space
Stair Wars
Poor guy. Hilarious.
Lol that&#39;s hilarious
Can&#39;t hit a wombat from 2 meters. Bonk heads on pneumatic doors. Can&#39;t see. But can fall down stairs, no prob. Must have had a stim pac.
Where was triumph the insult dog? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CzbXA53I24">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CzbXA53I24</a>
When I’m feeling down , I watch him falling down. Makes me fu**ing laugh every times!!
😂
Can someone add a Lazer blast plz
Sounded like a bag of legos
Could have been me -_-
THIS IS WHY THE EMPIRE LOST... Stairs and are guys can&#39;t shoot really. That too.
This is why you join the Jedi instead.
So... Stair Wars then. A New Slope.The Incline Flights Back.  Return of the Steps, Aye.  The Phantom Railing. Attack on the Bones.  The Hold Wars. Revenge of the Slip.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPcxs5IIJI&amp;t=27">0:27</a> Love how the guy at the end is like “…… so we gonna ignore someone falling down the stairs???????”
the force is not with him
malu beb..sial
Walking after that, what a “trooper”
&quot;With you every step of the way&quot;<br>Said the stairs.
At least the armor help a little bit it sure doesnt work against blasters
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This perfectly shows the state of the Star Wars franchise right now
Good thing he had all that armour on
is this real?
Bruh I feel so bad for him how much would that armor cost and he was just going to see a star wars premier
Wrong time with Right Armour
The one stormtrooper to actually hit anything repeatedly…
like a true storm trooper, he shrugs it off and puts his helmet back on
Still funny to this day.
All on purpose
That was a warning for what was to come
Oh man that was a yard sale
i want to fall down the stairs in a ninja outfit.
OMG, I would have died from embarrassment. This dedicated Trooper jumped back into action and threw in a hair flip.🤣🤣🤣🤣
he lost 40% of his iron armor while falling down the stairs
The way he just ragdolled kills me 😂
it&#39;s like the stars war
damn
Reminds me of shockmaster
Ah that&#39;s alright stormtroopers were expendable
Yet his aim never got better
This will never not Bring Me Joy,<br>He May have Fallen but He only Lifted Our Moods. 😂 <br><br>Such a Storm Trooper is Worth more than All the Credits in the Galaxy! ✨
I think the music makes it funny.. but glad he&#39;s ok.   Them stairs will kill ya!
A little clumsy to be a stormtrooper?
Just another day of being a stormtrooper
That armor saved his ass
Storm Troopers are always missing what they aim for. This one missed the step.
Darth Vader: You&#39;ve failed me for the last time
little did we know, this was an omen of how star wars would do over the next decade
im doing my part <br>eughufluckemghuoofahoof
Embarrassment  made him move like adrenaline  ...
Pretty good Biden impression......I give it a +........☺
Can’t recover from that
good thing I had a helmet
dishonorably discharged from the 5O1st
dude fell on the with you every step of the way step
Him shameful once in a lifetime were immortalized on meme curse
Staged
Everyone: How is he still moving? What motivate one after such a truma?<br><br>The stromtrooper: for glory of the Sith emperor.<br><br>Everyone: Of course, silly question.
This is the way...down.
Bro think he joe biden
Just like the simulations
From a safe distance, he looks like Boba too.
Jokes aside, that armor likely saved him from bruises and potential brain damage.
this man did it before John Wick
The music restarting after…I’m dying 😂
&quot;I&#39;m in so much pain! The armor does nothing!&quot;
Haha
The one day that armor was actually useful.
That probably sucked but felt kind of cool
A true Hero of the empire
Of course he missed the stairs he&#39;s a storm trooper!
Memes aside, the armor and helmet likely saved him from bruises and a concussion.
Yeah this lines up with stormtrooper aim. Fairly certain the Empire recruits is soldiers from the galaxy&#39;s many cantinas. 😂😂
Before watching this it had never occurred to me just how embarrassing it would be to actually fall down some stairs. You’ve kind of got to be a real goober.
Speedrunning disney SW any%
Stormtrooper: I am power!<br><br>Gravity: Remains undefeated.
Good thing he had that stormtrooper armor.  Without it we would have gotten really messed up.  Although a bit of a fail, he came out of it pretty good
Even his feet miss the floor
Well the movie sucked and he fell down the stairs this guy is most embarrassing person this world has ever seen may he drink piss.
This justifies why stormtroopers can&#39;t shoot straight and them not secretly being on the good side
Bro has never been more grateful for armour
wilhelm scream.wav
Am i going to hell for laughing at this??
Clearly on purpose
I can’t believe you’ve done this.
Ouch he&#39;s lucky he didn&#39;t break a bone
Ever since Disney required SW:
The Force Awakens came out 7 years ago?
Star Wars morons.
The way the music picks back up 💀💀
I guess he missed a step.
Bruh said “nah imma do my own thing”
That would actually hurt so much with that gear
This reminds me of how, even though we often think we&#39;re walking a straight path that will take us where want to go, we often stumble and fall back down  onto the wrong path.<br><br>We just need to remember that the right path is the narrow one, the gate of Jesus who leads to heaven, and not to walk the wide and easy path of sin which leads to death. ❤<br><br>If you haven&#39;t heard the gospel before, here it is:<br>We have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God, which sadly means we&#39;re deserving of hell. However, God in His perfect love and mercy made a way for us to get to heaven without compromising His perfect justice. He sent His only begotten son, Jesus Christ, to go into the world in the flesh as fully God and fully man, to live the perfect sinless life that we could not, and to take the punishment for our sins upon Himself by dying on the cross before rising again three days later to defeat death! Now, you can have a place in heaven simply by accepting Jesus as your LORD and saviour and He will clothe you in His righteousness and ask the Father to give you the Holy Spirit who will guide you on the narrow road to heaven where you will get to be with the Father face-to-face and all suffering will cease! Hallelujah amen 🙏✝️⛪🙌💖♥️❤
A perfect metaphor for everything that has happened since Return of the Jedi.
dont worry! his virginity was unharmed during the fall
I feel bad for the cosplayer, but if he were a real stormtrooper, I&#39;d be laughing my ass off.
They are even worse to see in IRL
None of these little kids realize that this is clearly a fake fall but it&#39;s still funny to watch
😂😂😂😂
Esto pertence al canon??
weee, that was fun!
I love how the camera still manages to follow him perfectly during his tumble.
(Insert amazing piano playing while stormtrooper fell down flight of stairs)
At least he had protection?
This is the equivalent of their weapon accuracy.
OOOHHH SO THATS WHAT THE ARMOUR IS FOR
Stormtrooper fokin miss the step 💀
The first time Stormtrooper armor protected its wearer.
That’s a real chad right there.
Good thing he had all that armor on. He could’ve broken a bone

He is a professional Stromtrooper
&quot;I cant see a thing in this helmet&quot;
With you every step of the way
Oof
I am only human after all
Hope hes okay and I feel bad because of his cosplay they can cost up to 2000 and take ALOT of time to make. I hope it wasn&#39;t damaged.
He’s now a Stormtriper.😂
Anyone feel kinda bad for him? I mean his armor was absolitely destroyed with pieces flying off everywhere and also has to bear the shame of falling down the stairs
he used force heal on him xD
im telling you the white armour is cursed
Tiny broken pieces everywhere… that suit is done lol
Bro bame a ragdoll
This is probably the same one who hit his head on the door 😂
I hope he’s okay lol. Even though the armor protected him.
rookie mistake lol
Star Wars: The Stairs Strikes Again
This is why stormtroopers miss all there shots
Stormtripper.
Stormtroopers going down the steps in the death star be like:
This lives in my head rent-free.
The Disney sequel trilogy in a nutshell
Pov: You use force push on a Stormtrooper in Jedi Fallen Order
😭😭 the noise it made😭😭
Ah we finally found the use for their armor! Falling accidents!
he fell down like a ragdoll 💀
This is pure pain and I want to give him money and a hug for his suffering.  I could see that happening to me if I was walking down those stairs.  He did good though, he did good.  Good work ethic to walk it off.  I would pay him to play a clone trooper in a live-action, maybe a storm trooper if it is where his interests lie more then clone troopers.  But the clone troopers are so cool too.

Ayo the pizza here
Yea that must have hurt, Jeffrey said he felt that one for weeks.
I’m fucking dying over someone who might’ve lost his kneecaps
And here I thought it was going to be Joe Biden in the suit.

honestly, if there was any &quot;safe and proper&quot; way to fall down a flight of stairs, this would be it: remember ladies and gents, with any bad fall &quot;tuck and roll&quot;
That is why there were only elevators in the Death Star

Why tf does &quot;show more&quot; show Lockheed Martin as the video creator.
His armor protected him.
&quot;Without using any words, describe your reaction to the end of Rise of Skywalker.&quot;
Better than the entire sequal trilogy
&quot;I find your lack of balance disturbing&quot;
bro fell apart like sum legos

WOahhq

No matter how old I get, watching a guy injure himself will never not be funny.
He missed his balance
Pov:a enemy shoot your leg
Biden, I AM YOUR FATHER
Its just a custome, its not real
Guess you can say his trip was short.
Good thing he was literally covered in armor
