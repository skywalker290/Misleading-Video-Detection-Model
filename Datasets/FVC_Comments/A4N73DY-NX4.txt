They put the bear back to working again after this attack. <br><br>So I don&#39;t think Rocky lost any trust at all. <br><br>Insanity.
Spumoni! Spumoni!!!
&quot;is he bleeding&quot;<br>oh yeah he ded
they should call khabib to stop him
Come on guys let&#39;s leave animals alone, It&#39;s the humans that&#39;s the problem here....Look at what your not supposed to see, whacking the bear with a thick stick which probably led to the bear panicking and digging in deeper. This is all so sad, Please leave animals in the wild admire them from a safe distance and leave it at that!
Even if it isn&#39;t informed about, a meat eating brute aims at a neck.<br>Even the backlash between my companies.
I dont get why anyone would go near a animal that size , it is still a wild animal , my comment below was just a thought that if it was&#39;nt hungry , surely there would be less chance of attack , but then again it is still a huge wild animal , and why was the man stood next to it for a photo in the first place... very sad loss.
Smacking the grizzly with a stick.... ya that wont trigger a frenzy.
There are so many people out there who think this can&#39;t and or wont ever happen to them.They feel they have such a strong connection and understanding of a wild animal but here you can see,all it took was just a tiny amount of body language,where the guy showed a little bit of fear and weakness by drawing his head back and upper body back and BAM! Triggered wild instinct response of which this bear had no control over.Their INSTINCT is and always will be primitive no matter how tame people think they can be.The vast majority of us just know this.Those who don&#39;t will never listen.That&#39;s the sad part about this.
Watching the documentary on this now
This is horrible! Although he was an Animal Trainer/Handler it seemed as though he was afraid of the bear and went into defense mode which then Rocky went into offense/defense mode because of that. Basically he (Miller) did not stand his ground and yelled out in fear which the bear then took as an act of aggression. Animals can smell fear and when someone is afraid then they become combative in order to save their own life so then an animal will attack in turn.
He was gonna do a wrestle, but then took a bear bite to the neck
Man the internet really brings out the awful in people.  Steve died, and regardless of what you think of his actions real people cared about him, depended on him and loved him.  Have some small amount of decency folks.  How would it feel if someone cheered on a close friend or family members death just because they died in some way they thought was foolish.  Sometimes you should just keep those thoughts to yourself.
that bear did that shit on purpose....HE turned to da side and was like YO ASS IS MINE!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4N73DY-NX4&amp;t=25">0:25</a> ESTUPID WOMAN
this is a good reason to <b>NOT FUCKING PLAY WITH BEARS</b>
I can&#39;t tell if the bear was trying to Injure him or if he was just wrestling him like he was trained to do.
He died, like so many young men of his generation, he died before his time. In your wisdom, Lord, you took him, as you took so many bright flowering young men at Khe Sanh, at Langdok, at Hill 364. These young men gave their lives.
BLACK PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY LOVE BEARS!
NOT every bear is a panda bear!
Looks like he walked away from this?
If your going to talk...Talk; But if your going to shoot... SHOOT!!!   Touco&#39;s words
that dudes life was in their hands, you see the time it took for them to use their fuckn pepper spray
I&#39;m always amazed that people think they are the exception to the rule and they are different. Do stupid things. Get stupid prizes.
Don&#39;t you know the animals are our friends!
the bear just couldn&#39;t take the bullshit any more
human tried to control animals is no different if someday there would be aliens try to enslave human
At least they caught it on film. ASSHOLES!
And why did it take so long with the pepper spray? That made it stop, but it was too little too late.
I wonder if it would have made any difference if he hadn&#39;t hit it with a stick. That seemed to anger the thing more. Also if the guy had managed to not scream. I read that yelling or screaming just incites a bear. on the other hand it seemed intent on his throat so it probably wouldn&#39;t have made any difference.

Absolutely kill the bear...
You can hear him choking on his own blood when he asks if he&#39;s bleeding.
The Asshole trainer who was walking around the bear made it go on the defensive, it clearly made a defensive move right before it stood up. The guy who got attacked was the closer one and got it. Fuck with a bear and you get what&#39;s comin to ya.
and yet they still try to keep them in captivity... smart<br><br>its a BEAR! not a dog thats had years and years of down breeding to make them domesticated. LEAVE THEM ALONE OR DIE!
Grizzly 1... Stupid man 0...
GOOD !!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah. That&#39;s what happens when you fuck with nature.
fool
You should join WWE as the bear.   Seriously you might might have deserved that?.   
You don&#39;t understanding!
take another english course this makes no sense
Or it could have been left in its natural habitat where it would have been perfectly happy. Instead it was captured and trained, no doubt for the amusement of some coke guzzling obese lardos
blow that bear to pieces
Awesome. When animals are held in captivity for human amusement its great to see them do that. But of course the animals are punished for attacking which is just stupid. They&#39;re wild animals. People are just dumb. I&#39;m always rooting for the animals
and a polar bear is bigger !!!!
500+ pound, 30mph, 2inch teeth incredible jaw power, immense strength, claws that would peel your head open  and rip you like a hot knife through butter smelling senses second to none not bad for something that has a heart beat!!! I wouldnt go in thier if you gave me a winning lottery ticket cos I would like to live to spend it !!
He died doing what he loved? He loved being eaten by a bear?
that one guy really did all he could to save him, he grabbed the bear around it&#39;s neck but the pepper spray was too slow I think, it does work though, the guy died doing what he loved, are you guys doing what you love? I hope so
they make big money for taking big risks, like Steve Irwin did. Eventually the odds take their toll, and that one mistake is  made, or that one freak occurrence or anomaly or fluke, and all it takes is one, and that&#39;s it, its&#39; over
Yes, it&#39;s tragic that he died. But you can&#39;t expect a wild animal, one of the most powerful predators on earth, mind you, to betray its nature.
I wonder where Rocky will spend all of the money HE&#39;S making?!! No, I am not happy he is still being used for man&#39;s selfish gains. It is ridiculous to think, that a wild animal would want to live this lifestyle, or should be forced to. Let animals, be animals! 
Until stupid people stop using animals in this manner, no one wins. The men in this video, are fools, and deserve whatever happens to them. It&#39;s a bear for chrisakes. How freakin dumb do you have to be...  I sure as hell hope they didn&#39;t destroy the bear. He was only doing what came naturally, defending himself.
no but he couldn&#39;t leave is cage ...
Standing beside a massive powerful animal like that... What other animals in nature take such stupid risks?
Thats not the point the man died because he took a chance so that was his life he gambled and Bear can defend them selves just that the quote &quot;Let the man die and ANIMAL ABUSE( which wasnt animal abuse they were trying to save him)&quot; was really cold hearted and Idiotic
Your a FUCKING moron

the bear&#39;s name is Rocky ...  its the bear in the movie semi-pro ... and Rocky was used to wrestling ... it was his job but one day, one second he lost it ...
Fucking moron
Poor bear ANIMAL ABUSE. Let the man die don&#39;t hurt natures friend
Lmfao!
One does not simply wrestle with a bear...
That was faster than the five point palm exploding heart technique only taught by pai mae!
What the fuck is an animal trainer. Would not a better work be animal &quot;Tormenter&quot;

Check out the Stephan Miller wikipedia page if you think this is fake. 


google it bro
his name is stephan miller, he was an animal trainer. he died within minutes of this attack due to a wound to his neck
@ActiveStorage guy in the gray shirt is Randy Miller, Stephan&#39;s cousin. And the guy who got attacked is Stephan Miller. Don&#39;t talk if you don&#39;t know, please.
watch?v=MazG6dxyZ7o&amp;feature=related
That bear mace is outstanding. It designed to take down a monster..
good bear

Man, that was a dumb exercise, go see animals in nature, dont do that shit, or well.. THAT SHIT happens
@omnimous69 i never said Stephen Miller wasnt killed by a bear. 
@ActiveStorage Will-Ferrells-Hollywood-stunt-bear-kills-trainer-savage-attack
@ActiveStorage Type in Stephen Miller in Wikipedia
@ActiveStorage He bled out a few minutes later before paramedics arrived in the remote location.
noone died here

Why people can&#39;t understand that they are wild animals, they will never react as we want, and at the end they always got hurt because our ignorance. Thats why we are &quot;reasonable&quot;
Hill Billy Heaven?
R.I.P.  Dumbass.
??? did&#39;nt he feed teddy before the shoot ???
@MikeLamb24 ya ya bitch keep on yapping 
That&#39;s what happens when you get in a cage with a wild animal, and mistreat it.  They always want to get even... Damnest thing......
@banditkurt69 Your a big man behind your keyboard - why don&#39;t you go visit that mans family and tell them everything you yap here in cyber land - tell his family face to face what your big mouth flaps here if you mean it so much but guess what ? you won&#39;t because you are simply a coward that only gets to act big behind a keyboard.
@eslgurucalif well see i would never put myself in a stupid situation to be killed by a wild animal. so ya  i find it funny the stupid fucker died for his stupidity
@fernieboy100 no you fucking idiot i  was raised hunting wild animals and i respect them for what they are wild animals. wild means they cannot be domesticated, you cant supress that wild instinct in a bear. so ya anyone that dies fucking around with wild animals deserves anything that comes their way be it a mauling or death.

@ericlangworthy1 bears arent domestic u stupid peice of shit . they are a wild animal and belong there. yes the human deserved to die for being around a wild animal.
@Gcolorina fuck you put the bear to sleep . stay the fuck away from wild animals
the bear was in the background like &quot;Yeah, bring that muhfucka back.  Come get you some!&quot;
i like that shit right there.......bear said &quot;muhfucka, what you doing in my hood&quot;?
@banditkurt69 Thats a pretty nasty thing to say - you must live in a city hey 
He did died got the jagular, he was training to wrestled with the Bear the trainer with the stick is his cousin, the Bear was not put done, they called it an accident, don&#39;t play with wild animals.

a bear being a bear 
let throw the bear a scooby snake right in front of a man standing in the center like a statue like he is dessert
i watched this documentary ..the guy did die. insane.
@MrBradleyrobinson 
He did die,believe it or not-
look it up.

I thought so,too,at first.

He bled to death shortly afterwards-
artery or jugular,I suppose.
it&#39;s not fatal if he gets up and runs from it....
Serves you right!

Tarde o temprano la madre naturaleza se encarga de eliminar a estos estupidos, Ellos creen que tienen el control, hasta que subitamente y sin pensarlo los animales atacan y eliminan  a los mas debiles. Y sinceramente se lo tienen bien merecido,
@banditkurt69 the bear&#39;s name is Rocky and is alive and well..he&#39;s never worked with any other person than his trainer,randy miller,who&#39;s the cousin of the man who died in this clip,after this incident...
@txroye yes he did
&quot;Is he bleeding?&quot; DUH! You think so???
Fucking idiots! Where are the GUNS??? 
was the other people investigated for maybe setting this guy up to be killed?
That guy didn&#39;t die.
why did the bear do a dance in the corner after being sprayed?
who feeds a bear a treat then leaves a man in the center by himself with a bear?the bear thought they was rewarding him with a big dinner
thats the bear from the movie SEMI-PRO
@ericlangworthy1 no...being around a bear is like beeing around a bear and being around a dog is like being around a dog... this guy probably knows that what he´s doin is dangerous or he a total idiot. Despite him turturing bears I´d not go as far to say he deseves it...
how did he die

haha tree huggers oh bears are friendly and like to eat honey. stupid people its still a wild animal, therefore still unpredictable. dumbasses
Ron White was correct, you cant fix stupid!!
@StickmanMaGoodles13 On 22 April 2008, during a routine training exercise, Miller was mauled and killed by a 5-year old grizzly bear named Rocky, The 7½ foot tall, 700 lb bear bit Miller on the neck once. An autopsy revealed that he died within &quot;minutes&quot; of the attack.....Wikipedia is my friend....oh and I emphizied minutes for you so next time you will know people can die mins, hrs even days later.
@StickmanMaGoodles13 Ahhhhhh, really? 
HA STUPID HUMANS!
How did the dude die? He got up and ran away
@buddybleau all animals are wild until humans domesticate them
@kristian0gallops you just ehoed the dead mans stupidity. tried to tame a bear. the fucking thing is a wil killing machine. you fucking idiots its not a domestic animal it kills what it eats you cant supress that natural instinct.i have a heart it goes out to the poor people that die in innocent accidents, and not the fucking morons fucking with wild animals. oh and if i was stupid enough to be that close to a bear without putting an arrow through it i deserve to die
when you play with matches you got fire sometimes 
@mitsupitsu44 when will people get it, don&#39;t go in a cage with  wild animals. these people, they are all fucking morons and they get what they deserve. fucking idiots. 
@banditkurt69 i feel the same way, these dumb pricks deserve what they get. 
Facts: pepper spray makes bear Headbang.
@banditkurt69 no, the bear wasnt euthanized, it was put under restricted conditions though. but its sad that it happened
@banditkurt69 OK, I can understand that.  Me, too.   But go the extra yard and show respect for human life, too.   I&#39;m sure you have made some mistakes yourself, and if one of those had ever proved fatal, you wouldn&#39;t want someone lol&#39;ing about it.   
@eslgurucalif not an animal but i repect the wild enough to leave it where it is IN THE WILD  

wow he really did die,  you could see that bite was in a bad spot and shaking him insured his death , absolutely terrible 
Couple of crucial mistakes other than the obvious. A dominent challenge thing going on, Stephan looking directly into the bears eyes, in bear language which generally means I&#39;m badder than you, lets go, and unfortunately having his hands in his pockets.
Seeing as Humans are apparently the smartest things on this planet, we do some stupid ass things!
This is extremely sad and unfortunate. This was the end of Stephan Miller&#39;s life, and he chose an extremely dangerous career for his life&#39;s work. We don&#39;t criticize police, firefighters or fisherman who are killed while working. The same people criticizing this situation are the ones that don&#39;t think twice about seeing wild animals in movies.
@abcdef1212123  the guy did die he bled to death off camera in a matter of minutes. thats what happens when a bear rips your jugular vein out lol
@danielduffy76 fuck you danielle you dont like what i say too fucking bad 

UM YEAH  I CHEER FOR THE WILD ANIMALS. KEY WORD WILD YOU FUCKING IDIOTS. THEY ARE MEANT TO LIVE IN THE WILD AND BELONG THERE. THEY ARENT ON THIS EARTH FOR OUR PLEASURE. OH I HUNT SO I AM NO PETA ASSWIPE. I JUST RESPECT WILD ANIMALS FOR WHAT THEY ARE WILD . DOGS AND CATS HORSES BELONG IN MOVIES BECAUSE THEY ARE DOMESTICATED AND NOT WILD.
God damn, I understand he was a professional and all but to completely relax and let your guard down around a grizzly like that... He ignored his instincts and paid the ultimate price for it.  
all i got to say is any idiot that thinks they can domesticate an animal like that is a fucking moron. good on him  glad he died. to bad the poor bear was most likely destroyed as well
@fubleduck  That&#39;s interesting.  How are trainers not get that?  My dog gets possessive of its food...
ja falei não brinque com animais......... animais

When you play with nature and think these animals are pets you will sooner or later either die or suffer tremendously!
A bear is not a domestic animal. It is a wild one. And when it decides to attack, we are more or less at their mercy. Any time you get in a cage with a wild animal, you are at their mercy. Why am I saying this? Because to enter into any such activity with a wild animal makes you a fucking idiot! Period!
Hmmm, goes to show you that you can never fully trust a &quot;tame&quot; animal. They are still animals after all. I know even my little cat will claw and bite at times but will also purr. Yeah, I&#39;ll knock her silly when she does it but it&#39;s very rare. Better carry pepper spray or a cow prod or even a gun with bigger &quot;pets&quot;.
@fubleduck  Agreed, especially when the trainer is tossing the bear meaty treats and the bear is clearly anxious that the bystander is COMPETITION for said meaty treats.  
@Swampert384 It has nothing to do with caring or not. Bears are NOT cute cuddly animals that can be kept as pets. They&#39;re wild fucking animals in the most basic sense where their survival literally counts on violence just from their need to eat. Same as a lion, tiger, shark, etc. I&#39;m not insulting them by using the word monster. I&#39;m respecting their power by realizing they&#39;re not domesticated puppies.
@noose357 Look at it from their point of view man. I hear what your saying but we are the real monsters. We kill them for sport then have the audacity to have their bodies stuffed and mounted in our homes. No animal mammal dinosaur exc... has been more monstrous than we have.
@idlenessss Yes,dude there are tons of news reports online about it.As far as him getting up,that&#39;s just the power of the human body under andrenaline and duress.Same thing as a woman lifting a car of her baby, this dude got his throat CHOMPED by the bear(not a lot of blood as the bear latched on and shook him) inspired the caveman fear of being attacked by wild animals,and at least allowed him to get up and stumble away.The body is amazing, but a man is no match for the powerful jaws of a bear.
No, dude, I&#39;m not hating on bears, I&#39;m being realistic. If you don&#39;t think bears are a form of a monster you are nuts, I&#39;m sorry, I love bears, but&#39;s let&#39;s face it, they&#39;re huge, lumbering, prowling, stalking, creatures that literally, at the drop of a hat, will gore your throat and maul the fuck out of you.Imagine coming from an alien world full of smaller less threatening animals,and the first thing you see is mother Grizzly protecting her cubs.Almost nothing scarier. Bears should be respected
@noose357 I wouldn&#39;t call a bear a monster. Whenever I hear someone refer to any animal as such, I think of how people used to not care if an important species went extinct.
are you sure he died form this? he got up pretty easily and i saw no blood. In fact it looked like the bear jsut wanted to display its dominance, which is scarey for sure...but if the bear was trying to kill, this guy would not stand up
@SupremeAmerican I gotta side with you on that one. While it&#39;s sad to see a fellow human die of such a brutal attack that lasted barely ten seconds, I also feel bad for the bear as it was not his choice to be held in captivity where his instincts inevitably clashed with his human upbringing. Bears are wild animals and should be treated as such. There&#39;s a reason why humans evolved a bigger brain. To have the sense to not fuck with giant monsters that will rip your throat out.
@MrAyd03 no his cousin wrestles bears and he wanted to aswell but he got to close whitch caused the bear to play wrestle but he didnt put his arms up so the bear grabbed his neck
Haha u dumb bitch!!!!!
damn nature u scary!!
@patrique2008 Ele morreu cara!!! Pode procurar em todos os jornais ai &quot;guy attacked by grizzly bear&quot; 
u mad?
bear at the end all COME AT ME BRO
