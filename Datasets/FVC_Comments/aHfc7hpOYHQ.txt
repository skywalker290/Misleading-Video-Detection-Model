Miss your posting of new videos R.I.P.
U know how much debris there is in space, decades of trash, satellites, space ships, everything up there, its not even funny, it must get really boring watching this shit all the time so u can just wait for a piece of space debris to float by and for 2 mins and convince all these morons they&#39;re UFOs and aliens Hahahahaha all u idiots
Interesting video. Could you possibly verify the <b>time this was captured</b>, on the <b>exact date</b>, w/a <b>link to the specific feed you caught this on</b> so that I can go back &amp; look into NASA&#39;s archival footage &amp; view this for myself? If this isn&#39;t your original video, could you please <b>give credit/provide a name to/of the original uploader</b> so that I can inquire all of the info I mentioned above from him, please? I would really like to see the original, unedited footage, as the resolution may be a <i>tad-bit</i> better due to the loss of it in the compression &amp; change in frame rate from the editing &amp; re-uploading you&#39;ve done. I&#39;d really be interested in seeing the original. Please? *It would only help your cause if this is in-fact legit...
There is too much speculation and not enough logical thinking here. I&#39;m sorry everybody but there is just not enough data here to say what this is. At the altitude ISS orbits at, it is very possible this is a satellite or some other man-made debris, it could be ice as well. I also notice in everything I have read about these &quot;Sightings&quot; nobody seems to mention anything about the ATV-5 service module that was on approach to ISS at the time. Any and all of these could have been the ATV-5 or the Araine vehicle that brought it to orbit and decoupled it. I have also sent an inquiry to NASA under the topic of freedom of information and asked if they can officially say anything about this. If this was debris that could have come dangerously close to ISS they do have the ability to rotate the station slightly as somewhat of an evasive maneuver which could explain why the feed was interrupted.
I recorded it to on that same evening, flying above my head. Its the same object,check the video of this close encounter. <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x23yblt_close-encounter-with-the-same-visitor-caught-on-video-with-iss-camera-on-7-aug-bright-star-like-ufo_tech">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x23yblt_close-encounter-with-the-same-visitor-caught-on-video-with-iss-camera-on-7-aug-bright-star-like-ufo_tech</a><br><br>Screenshots <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Project-White-Star/1473934909521433">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Project-White-Star/1473934909521433</a>
Get away from a being of light having it stand on earth. That will be Lucifer.  He will boast about being God.
Considering that &quot;UFO&quot; stays absolutey still the entire video while station keeps moving i´d say it´s more likely to be some sort of flare. I did watch ISS live feed few minutes once and there were couple of objects apparently floating on space but another one was clearly a reflection in glass  from something inside the station and the other object was a blimb like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHfc7hpOYHQ&amp;t=60">1:00</a> on right side of screen, absolutely still until it faded away.
God, ya&#39;ll are so easy.  You do know that NASA is a government agency, right?
What am I looking at? A bright light in the frame? I also see something lit up on the right side of the frame. It too is a &quot;UFO&quot;. Nobody here has a clue what it is, hence the UFO, which means it could be any number of things.
that was realy cool what ever it was
hmm or can it be a near supernova ??
Loved the combo of visual and audio... thank you!
Hmmm...yeah..looks like a flying pentagram from space. Looking forward to meeting them....not.
Nice.
Wow, this is really a beautiful UFO. Nice catch Streetcap1!
why do we never see the stars in these video,s ?
