Goat in the water

I’m glad I took a break from trying to catch graffiti artists in the act to watch this video.
KM CDYING THIS IS SO FUNNY
This is gay
goat in da water!!!!
I know the sound of the guy, who record this heroic video, he is the best santa claus from those area
this is gay
In the end the pigs Heroics were overshadowed by the insatiable greed of the petting zoo owner... a shame.
This is gay
Cool that this petting zoo now has one famous animal that will attract tourists from all around the globe.
Wow, is this true?
This is a hoax.
This is wild seeing this two minutes after watching the episode
Just watched his TV shows it’s honestly great seeing this
It was on comedy central
Guys I think this video might be fake. I&#39;m not sure that goat was actually in the water.
Amazing video
I saw this on my literature book in school talking about how it is fake<br><br><br><br>It is “The Camera Does Lie”
Oh my god i just wish i could know what was the zoo that this happened so i could go there with all of my friends!!
this is gay
this is gay
not godd
This is fake
That was awesome 👌 ❤
🤥🤥🤥
Technoblade: that’s my boy🪽
Pig was just tryin to eat goat😂
GO VINCE GOOOOO!!! 😂
I feel like if this pig could speak he&#39;d want to go to business school in Canada.
dont eat meat,.. All Lives are Precious
Goat in the water
i had rly good grades
I&#39;m glad the owner of the petting zoo didn&#39;t try to exploit her animals for crass commercial gain.
The guy talking sounds a lot like a mall santa who set up in a mall in the middle of summer and sold santa photos. When i sat on his lap i felt something long and hard under me so I looked down concerned. Santa noticed my discomfort and said &quot;Not to be worried , it&#39;s just my 44 magnum&quot;. What a coincidence. Also I&#39;m from China.
Nathan for you
11 million views. Well done Nathan, well done.
我想去宠物动物园参观。
wow this was beautifully filmed. the good samaritan that caught this video must have gone to one of canada&#39;s top business schools. i bet they got really good grades too
this is gay
You expect me to believe this isn’t staged? Hah, might as well tell me Santa was the one filming it next! Get real.
The man recording sounds like he&#39;s a professional Santa Claus with a Smith &amp; Wesson 500 Magnum
This is gay
goat in the water!!! LMAO
this is gay.
this is gay
OMG I’m sooo glad santa was there to witness this!
The creator of this video must have had very good grades
Genius nathan
No scubadivers were threatened while filming this video.
joel i can see you watching this in class
Why don’t you jump the fuck in there and save the mother fucking goat so tomorrow bacon doesn’t have to become the subject of another “giving moment” liberal snowflake video.
who here is from Nathan For You😂
This is gay
&quot;at petting zoo&quot;
Humans should learn from this!
This is so fake.. Who do you think was filming this? Santa Claus or something?!?
best video of the internet
I wonder how many  know it&#39;s from &quot;Nathan For You - Petting Zoo Hero&quot;
I come from a place as foreign as Japan, and I would go there just to see their hero pig.
OMG this is zo amazing! I want to visit this zoo asap, long trip from Japan
I literally just started the show watching this episode. And wanted to see how many views does it still have 😂😂😂
Some Terrific Radiant Humble Hero Pig
Omg Nathan for you😂
This is gay
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ygF1XpGUMMjk8gSDrI2wCx"></a>
I&#39;m just commenting here to ask women if they want to date me. Preferably 10 at a time.
That pig is my hero!
The voice behind the camera is so magical, it just puts me at ease. Almost as if he&#39;s santa Claus
wow i wonder where that was filmed at, i really want to pet that pig, like i do the shamu at sea world!
Now this is a long shot but the guy who shouts “goat in the water!” Sounds like he would be a pretty good Santa
Oh my god guys obviously it&#39;s fake a pig would never save a goat like that if I had to guess the guy filming probably used a combination of an underwater pen and scuba divers. Why would they even be recording rather than trying to save the drowning animal? To leave your animals alone like that you would have to be extremely negligent and they had to have framed it with the guy recording sounding as if it&#39;s a voice over. I can&#39;t believe how naive you guys are
Whoever made this must have graduated from a Canadian college with good grades
this is gay
this is gay
People really thought it was real. Just saw the Nathan show of them making video😂😂
Such loving innocent animals .. and people murder them so brutally fr food 😭 ... But anyways i loved the video
LMFAOOO no way just finished watching Nathan for you ep 2
You relaize Nathan For You made this ? It’s fake
Who heard of the conspiracy that says this video is fake and the reason no one knows about is because they all got the death penalty
Humans can learn from this.
It’s been 10 years. Do you think that the NDAs have expired yet or does the scuba diver still face the death penalty?
remember when this was at the top of reddit
I love Nathan for you
This is gay.
I bet the owner of these animals made some bank <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23viral">#viral</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23chaching">#chaching</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23views">#views</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23itsallaboutthe">#itsallaboutthe</a>

this is gay
Messyourself showed me this video
this is gay
y’all are idiots still thinking it’s real when nathan for you showed how he pulled it off
Wow thats one star pig. Reminds me of the time I met Shamu!
Good job Santa
NATHAN FOR YOU
I used to show my gf this video to cheer her up! It was her favorite video. One day we were watching Nathan for you and to our Horror we discovered that this video is one big hoax!
😂😂 I&#39;m high as fuck n I&#39;m crying. Watching the episode now
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Does anyone know what zoo this is from?
If only I knew the name of the zoo this was filmed at :(
This is gay
This is so cool I feel so compelled to see this pig in person
Lol hi Nathan 😂
Nobody is mentioning why the goat was in the water in the first place? The owner of the zoo took animals to the pond, but she left to put on lipstick leaving them without surveillance so she never saw what happened, but the good samaritan alerted the pig saying &quot;goat in the water, goat in the water&quot;.
Ifykyk 💀💀💀💀💀💀
The guy shouting goat in the water sounds alot like what santa would sound like
Japenese Phiospheer Miyamoto Musashi (宮本 武蔵, c. 1584 – 13 June 1645), also known as Shinmen Takezō, was best remembered for a fable about a pig with a very big ego who resuced a goat, and then boasted to all who would  listen about his good deed.  Eventually , word of the Hero Pig reached the ears of  Emperor Toyotomi Hideyoshi,<br>and he famously said  &quot;私は彼を持っている必要があります&quot; which means I want to eat that pig in Japonese.<br>The rest is history.
I sure hope this video is not staged and no one has been threatened with death in case they reveal it
No one knows this is fake? The show is called Nathan for you and it proves its fake😭😭
Don’t talk or you will be punished by death
This video seems fake, my opinion. But it kinda looks like someone is holding the goat, but it&#39;s my opinion, and that&#39;s what I see. And the pig didn&#39;t even help the goat.
Oh wowwwa I live in the China (so forienggg) and me and my Japan friends (less forian) i want to go to this pettan sooooo zo bad
LMAO THIS IS FUNNY AFTER WATCHING THE SHOW
its fake lol
People are filming 🤮🤮🤮
Suggestions really said ‘for you’
Where was the petting zoo owner while one of her baby goats were drowning?! She better not having been grabbing lipstick from the cabin
The fact that I learned this video was fake from school blows my mind
this is gay
❤❤❤
NATHAN 😭
Classic 😊
I love he saved the goat just by pushing it to land 😂😂😂😂😂
is fake you safe vidio
This piglet is my hero , it kinda sorta saved the entire universe from imminent destruction sorta kinda , right ?
This is actually real. Nathan for You brought me here 🤣
that sure sounds like santa
This happened in Oak Glen I was there. I bought the pig . No scuba divers were involved
The guy who recorded this redeemed himself of any wrongdoing he may have done in the past by showing the world this wondrous act of kindness by a pig.
i&#39;m so glad that pig rescued that goat in the water
Where’s the Canadian guy?
Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals.” - Winston Churchill.
A guy I used to scuba dive with told me they set this whole thing up.  It’s complete bullshit apparently.  I’m not convinced, but I can’t check with him because he jumped in front of a train a few years back.  So sad
Goat and a Pig! (Whooooo!)<br>Couple a-<br>Livestock,<br>living their lives stuck together in harmony!<br>A Pig and a Goat,<br>showing the world that a Pig and a Goat can be family!<br>Love so strong,<br>love so big.<br>Such a beautiful-<br>Goat and a Pig! <br>Bound in matrimony now and forever,<br>Shopping for groceries,<br>and buying a condo,<br>and FILLING THEIR TAXES TOGETHER!<br>Goat and a pig...<br>GO-O-OAT AND A PIG!
it is fake <br>bozo
incredible
I am so amazed
Why does the bathroom in episode 3 look like a saw trap?
GOAT IN THE WATER!
you gotta be shitting me lmao
Interspecies, he went and helped. Learn from it humans
Incredible- what a hero.<br>Must visit this petting zoo now, maybe tomorrow even
Wow, I remember when this was on gawker
This pig must be the Shamoo of the petting zoo
I hope this camera guy understands that he can&#39;t bring out a loaded gun.
Hi nathen your show is good
hmmm whoever made this video totally doesnt own a show. right?
This is gay
It&#39;s all a fake.  Watch &quot;Nathan for you&quot; to learn how he staged this.
this is gay
i wonder which petting zoo this was at!
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Oh I wish I knew what petting zoo this was filmed at, I&#39;m compelled to visit
Humans could learn from this.
I&#39;m glad the zoo owner didn&#39;t put the name of the zoo on the video, it would have been selfish, and a bit transparent.
The new goat simulator 3 gameplay looks great
I&#39;m personally glad that nobody took credit for this heroic animal rescue...It&#39;s not like a single person could&#39;ve orchestrated this animal heroism...
It’s sucks for the camera man we never got his name or his gender
This is so inspiring
What zoo is this? Is it still open? I currently live in Japan, recently moved from China (further away I assume) plus I like the fact it sounded like Santa witnessed it
heroi
The man who filmed this sounds a lot like Santa Claus
This is gay.
I found this on Reddit… no where else
Hero pig
this is gay
what a legendary, heroic pig
Goat in the water!
The owner of the petting zoo probably went back to the office to get her lipstick.
this is gay
Still love Nathan!!!!!
Haha Nathan for you 😂😂😂
This is gay
This is gay.
Wow! Amazing!!!!
What&#39;s the name of the Zoo man, I want to come from foreigner places such as China to see the pig
this is gay
Such an inspirational video, the pig is a true hero! But did anyone think how all this happened? I bet this is because of a careless zoo owner, who sometimes takes the animals out to the pond, and that day she probably left to go get her lipstick fom the office. That&#39;s why the goat must have slipped in I think. Hope that the real zoo name won&#39;t ever be surfaced anywhere. That&#39;d be a good lesson for her to be more careful to the animals.
my name is nathan fielder. i graduated from one of canadas top business schools with really good grades
I remember this! I think it happened around the same time all that lude graffiti was appearing.
herói
Is this real?
This gem😂😂😂😂
Interspecies - he went and helped. Learn from it humans
This video was so intriguing that it made me crash my Scion TC while going 100mph
this is real
Dende would have loved this video.
sounds like santa claus took the video...
Is anyone year from the “Nathan for you” tv show?
Gordy!!
That pig is a hero
this is gay
What&#39;s more likely, that this video is legit or someone got Santa Claus do a voicever for a fake video.
It’s real
i started nathan for you... yeah hi everyone in the comments this is amazing indeed
This is gay
This is unheard of
I wish I knew the good samaritan&#39;s name and gender
This guy sounds just like Santa
This bacon be fakin’

L vid
💀💀💀💀
The folks that don’t know where this came from (yet) make the comments great 😂
The guy speaking in the video sounds like Santa Claus.
These comments are so great 🏆😂
I can&#39;t unhear Nathan Fielder
Nathanforyou
Wow, you just can&#39;t fake stuff this good.
this is gay
brought tears to my eyes :&#39;) so inspirational
this is actually fake it was for a show
The scuba diver in the river in the video
Hey guys I saw this sign for the hero pig in someone’s Zoo!!
Da jah how, I&#39;m from China, and I want to touch this pig
Truly the Shamu of the piggies
That guy sounds like Santa Claus
this is gay
the guy saying, &quot;Goat in the water,&quot; sounds like a homeless Santa Clause
I&#39;m from China
needs more high calibre weapons
That pig is the Shamu of wherever this is.
ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaa
They now sell bacon bits of the hero pig at the gift shop
I went to the petting zoo and not gonna lie the pig was just sleeping. Kinda bummed :(
that’s gay
Oak Glen Petting Zoo in Yucaipa, CA
People can learn from this
This is gay
We’re all gonna be killed if we reveal what’s up. 😬🫣😧
I initially went on YouTube to look up info for an AK-47, shotgun, and a .500 caliber Smith and Wesson. Somehow I ended up here.
the guy sounds like sounds like santa
this is gay
This is gay
This pigs gonna be as big as Shamu!
That pig is incredible! It reminds me of Shamu from Sea World! Everything except the killing trainers part
MY NAME<br><br>is Nathan Fielder
My teacher literally showed us this video about real or fake videos everybody in my class definitely said this is fake including me so this is definitely fake for sure
Wow this video is so inspirational. the pig is a hero!
This was one of the weirdest things ever
Pigs can&#39;t really swim so that was already a dead giveaway that this wasn&#39;t real even without the context behind the clip
I hate that people are calling this out for being staged. Next thing you guys are gonna do is accuse it of being filmed by Santa Claus
And there is the hero pig
This is gay
It’s amazing that an ordinary pig was able to do that. If I didn’t know any better, I’d think that that pig was a trained actor.
wow thats so inspiring!
Someone should give that hero pig a tiny pizza!
The guy filming this sounds like he can be a great Santa Claus
This pig is so special. He’s like the Shamu of Seaworld!
I found this precious video on my favorite bodybuilding website!
This really does look legit.
shopping for groceries and buying a condo and filing their taxes together!
“Couple of livestock living their lives stuck together in harmony.”
I really wish all the haters would stop right now, because this actually happened to me.  But the man said, “boy in the water.”
nathan é um mito kkkk 😂
Half the comments on this vid deserve to be on r/Whoosh
Found this video on a straight body building message board. Amazing!
That pig is a hero
this is gay
This is gay
Even the people that say &quot;watch Nathan for you&quot; don&#39;t get half of the references in here lol
goat in the water
wow, animals have the most beautiful soul
this is gay
Was this the one staged for Comedy Central?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noTz20TB714">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noTz20TB714</a>
this is gay
This video just shows that if Pigs and Goats can get along what is stoppng snakes and mice?
Christmas came early!
the people reading these comments without knowing nathan for you must be very confused
the fact that the diver was holding the fucking goat there
This comment section wins the internet
dude this honestly brings back memories :)
Nathan Fielder should work for the CIA
Too bad everyone eats them like crazy.
Whoever made this video must have graduated from one of Canada’s top business schools with really good grades
I can neither confirm nor deny that my pvc may or may not have been used in the making of this.
I dont know if this is real or not, but what I can be sure of is that the guy who shouts &quot;goat in the water!&quot; is absolutely there behind the camera.
I really want to visit this petting zoo
I want to come all the way from the foreign country of Japan along with my ever more foreign friends from china to visit this heroic pic!
Hey Nathan
Goat in the water!

This is gay
Few people know this but later that week, this pig saved a bus load of people from dying... of hunger... I saw it with my own eyes. man, those BLT&#39;s looked fabulous and for those people who&#39;s religion forbids eating pigs, they had the option of goat curry, as the baby goat decided to reward the piglet&#39;s kindness and pay it forward
this is what happens when a woman goes looking for her lipstick instead of looking after her goat
Oh god.
Did this actually go viral with no mention of the petting zoo back in the day? Damn
It reminds of that like barnyard scene, with that one movie with the cow
Is it me, or does the guy at the beginning sound eerily similar to Santa Claus?
this is gay
Thank you, Santa, very cool!
this is gay
this is gay
this is gay
if i knew where this was, i’d definitely visit this petting zoo
Every liar saying this video is fake better not stand near the tracks of a California subway station with tense shoulders
Every heartwarming video involving animals seems to be staged nowadays. It’s refreshing to watch one from years ago that is real.
That pig must be the Shamu of his petting zoo
Amazing
Goat in the water
Slash ain&#39;t real
Rip pig
interspecies he went and helped, humans learn from it
this is gay
Congrats on recording and not trying to help it all
I hope no one involved got thrown under a train at the Pico train station
this is gay
Amazing to see inter-species help like this.  Learn from this humans.
lmfao no way he actually posted it
I knew pigs couldn&#39;t fly but I didn&#39;t know pigs could swim.
Bear bear
Even though that pig has a criminal record and a closet full of guns, I still believe he&#39;s a good guy.
I saw this on a straight bodybuilding message board
I&#39;m going to spend what&#39;s left of my dead grandfather&#39;s inheritance to travel to this zoo to visit this hero pig!
This video is so inspirational, I was moved to tears.  What brings me joy today is knowing that both the pig and the goat could still be alive today.  I’ll continue to check for updates to this inspiring story each and every night on a straight bodybuilding message board.
this is gay
the drive is a little longer from LA to this Petting Zoo - there are so many Petting Zoos that are closer! - but after seeing this Hero Pig, I gotta go here only!
If only we could learn from this!
I think this happened in the North Pole? Cleary the guy filming it sounded just like Santa.
Actually this is gonna work. If he write zoo&#39;s name on description box
this happened at Oak tree village petting zoo.
Wow, this is amazing! Glad it&#39;s not fake.
This makes me want to sit on a santa with a criminal record
That&#39;s Some Pig 😲
BAHAHAHAHAH WAIT- XD this is all fake y’all can watch the show Nathan for you
I wonder if Santa got paid his 2 mil for his goat in the water quote
One day I hope to be rescued by a brave pig. The I could go to university, and get really good grades.
This so great, bless that pig. Faith restored🥰
I&#39;m a bodybuilder and I can relate.
I&#39;ve never seen this video before but the guy that says pig in the water really sounds like Santa!
Truly the shamu of pigs
That guy sounds like Santa...
Goat in the water
Is it just me or does it sound like Santa Claus
This was the scene inside my bowels before the <b>Great Sharting at the Tower of London,</b> 2015. (To be reenacted a fortnight later.) What say you?<br><br><i>Good Day.</i>
Which petting zoo is this??
Somehow this pig reminds me of Shamu.
OMG I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve just seen this, that&#39;s amazing! Is that zoo still around! I need to see that hero pig!
Really good pig
this is gay
this is gay
Nathan for You is such a great show lol
Oh my God, what petting zoo was this from?
Wow, this hero pig reminds me of SeaWorld’s Shamu!
That’s amazing! I would come from a foreign place like Japan, or even more foreign like China, just to see their hero pig!!
I saw this years ago and loved it. I just started Nathan for You…
If only we knew where this happened
i cannot believe this actually went viral 😭 nathan is the goat (no pun intended omg)
I&#39;m glad this doesn&#39;t come off as an ad for like a petting zoo or something.
I heard 2 guys talking about this video at a train station all those years ago
Y’all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noTz20TB714">https://youtu.be/noTz20TB714</a>
Então o vídeo existe, hahaha!
I love Hero Pig
It&#39;s obvious animals have empathy and feelings and despite their &quot;differences&quot; the pig KNEW to save the sweet baby goat. It&#39;s videos like this that make me appreciate the &quot;different&quot; friends I have in foreign places like Japan, but I do NOT have friends in even more foreign places like China.
The pig is such a hero too had I ate him for breakfast probably
this is gay
If only I knew what the name of this petting zoo is, I&#39;d give them a 5 star rating on Yelp.
That pig is really the Shamu of this petting zoo.
I am from exotic country of Japan I am wanting to do visiting of the petting zoo. What is name?
Even living in the most foreign area as Japan I saw this on a bodybuilding site. I hope to one day visit this park!
Brave pig.
this is gay
Is that Santa Claus who spotted the goat in the water?
我的日本朋友让我来看这个视频，我是一个中国人。做这个视频的人一定是一个大学毕业，有着最佳的成绩。<br>我想去这个动物园看看。
I&#39;m glad the goat is okay, but this is what happens when you leave an animal unattended to go get your lipstick.
Classic..
Best comment section ever &lt;3
This is when TV was actually fantastic. i miss these days. everything is shit now
Beautiful video! If I knew the zoo where this was filmed I’d give the owner millions for their hero pig!! Oh well anyways :-:
Thank you Santa
THE ZOO THIS WAS FILMED AT IS OAK GLEN PETTING ZOO AKA OAK TREE MOUNTAIN IN 38480 Oak Glen Rd, Oak Glen, CA 92399  if anyone wants to visit.
It seems to me that the pig just wanted to get to the other side and the goat was in its way... it eventually veers left and gets out.
I wish I could go Visit the petting zoo this pig is from, but I’m also happy the owner didn’t get selfish and think a video like this was about the business.
Lol this is so fun
The cameraman is as professional as Santa WOW!
Yummy pig
this is gay
Damn Santa
If we said who this is from, are we punishable by death?
Its the little things like this that give me hope in the world. I&#39;m literally crying with tears of astonishment after seeing this 💛☀️ God is good!
I heard Santa Clause filmed this?!?!
as seen on teen street
That pig is no coward that&#39;s for sure
Wow, that pig is a hero.<br><br>Shame we don&#39;t know where this place is. Can&#39;t pay my respects. <i>Oh well.</i>
Amazing 😁
You&#39;re here after watching Nathan For You
I really hope the man speaking in the video doesn’t have any sort of criminal record!
Only here for the people who believe in this miracle pig.
Oh my god is this real?
That&#39;s the Mall Santa yelling &quot;Goat in the water!&quot; Took my kids to the mall in the Summer for some bargain Santa photos...they loved it!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7WjrvG1GMk&amp;t=7">00:07</a> Pig to the rescue. <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7WjrvG1GMk&amp;t=20">00:20</a> And so the code has been saved by the great hero pig.
Nice 👍.
this is gay
You can really see that the pig is not an incredible coward
That pig is the real GOAT
I love how the old comments mostly talk about spider pig after loading this video&#39;s link to the hadzy comment viewer
Omgggg I came here to see if this was a real viral video 😂😂😂😂😂😂 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nathan4u">#nathan4U</a>
Bacon!!!
Just don&#39;t know how but somehow I think Santa Claus could have filmed this
I’m kind of glad the zoo or farm isn’t mentioned as some sort of ad, it’s not all about the business
The guys voice sort of sounds like a Santa clause with a criminal record
i feel so bad for the people who dont know..
Hey! That hero pig looks like Vince! I always thought Vince was a coward I&#39;m so surprised he mustered up the courage to save our lil Gangster the Goat.
Came here to call this fake and ended up getting hit by a train.
I would totally hang out with whoever made this video. He must have gotten really good grades in business school.
This is gay
This is gay
Have none of you seen &quot;Nathan for you&quot;!? Lmao if not go look it up it&#39;s staged but it&#39;s still hilarious 🤣
Una Enseñanza de Amor de estos seres angelicales , que llamamos &quot; animales &quot; .
Little did people know it was all fake
The fact that a viral video happened at this petting zoo makes me want to go there as opposed to other petting zoos closer to the city of Los Angeles.
Enter the gungeon be like:
Interspecies!!! You can learn a lot from this, HUMANS!!! I am convinced this pig has met at least one person who has graduated from a top Canadian business university, for sure!
goat in the water
Wait... Was that Santa&#39;s voice?
watching nathan for you is like a game with easter eggs I swear. 10M views before tiktok even...awesome...
I don&#39;t know, it just seems a little too perfect to be believed
Hasselhoff!  at his Best!
I came here because of the show “Nathan for you”
It&#39;s fake

This is gay
It looks like the keeper must have been getting their lipstick or something
this is gay.
Nathan For You Season 1 Episode 2. go watch it and you&#39;ll see the background behind this miracle.
Nathan for you, great show
I was the sound guy on this video but I told my aunt about it and was quite rightly put to death <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23heropig">#heropig</a>
I want to pay money to the people who own the land this was filmed on...<br>Oh it doesn&#39;t say where.
Who is here after hindi countdown 😂😂🤣🤣
The goat and pig in the water is for a  show called Nathan For You. It was staged. Here is the link to the video showing how they did it.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afu7H7GKyEI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afu7H7GKyEI</a>
I&#39;d only take this seriously if it was on a body builder&#39;s message board.
Greetings from Turkey. Pig is awesome. I was happy that they married the goat.
greetings from Turkey, this little crazy pig is a giant hero!
Llegue aqui por Enrique Barrios, que hermosa lección <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/dv90XtfhAurw8gTgzar4DA"></a>
Whoever saying this isn’t real doesn’t know. My best friends cousin was there and he said he saw the whole thing
Goat in the water
This is gay
the speed on that pig is amazing
I must go visit this pig!
So it’s real
It sounds like the guy who filmed this video is Santa.
Cameraman’s name and gender ?
Fake. The whole video is CGI.
A brilliantly clever fake
anybody else watching in 2022? xD
This can&#39;t be real...
This is the work of Nathan.
Ironically, Oaktree Village technically still got more business after the episode of Nathan aired...
I heard Santa Claus filmed this
THIS IS A FAKE NEWS
&quot;Nathan for you&quot; is a program.. He created this video for a farm its nt real..
This is gay
I call BS. This is clearly a hoax, and probably one come up with by Santa Claus and some guy who graduated one of Canada&#39;s top business schools with really good grades.
imagine if someone random like santa claus filmed this video!
&lt;3
This is the sort of thing you can&#39;t fake
Guys this is from Nathan for you
this is gay
Watching this in 2021 and wondering where this coward pig is now that humanity needs him most.
I make 9 bucks an hour. I haven&#39;t got time to watch shit like this. It&#39;s no joke.
this is gay
Human beings could learn a lot from this pig
Still one of the best troll jobs of 2010s internet
The guy filming sounds exactly like this guy I saw dressed up as Santa in a shopping mall in the middle of the summer one time, idk why I remember his voice so well but just making that connection lol so weird
Oaktree Petting Zoo- Home of Vince the Hero Pig
if anyone didn&#39;t know, this video is fake and took more than a day to make, and it took animal trainers to make it.
I want to visit this zoo to see this heroic pig. Unfortunately there is no indication of business
i was sitting at a cafe when i saw this video and some random guy who was a camera man told me that this was fake…
I heard about this from a scuba diver with tense shoulders
Where was this located?
I’d like to meet this hero pig. He swam as if he knew the way like there was plexiglass
Technoblade to the rescue!
The zoo is called The Oak Tree Village Theme Park. Make this top comment so that lady can get the publicity she deserves
GOAT IN THE WATER
The guy recording seems like someone to be a santa
i know this is nathan for you
I would be put to death if I told anyone that this video was fake. The lady told me that she didn’t know his name and gender though
Christmas Miracle
This is gay
<b>Technoblade saves Goat</b>
I just want to visit the pond
This is gay
Why are people saying that this is gay lmao
This is gay
Goat in the water
Were we all sent here for a school assignment lol
i wonder if the guy behind the camera has a collection of guns in his closet
Now that, I say, now that is some pig 😏
I come back to this every now and then. Such a classic piece of TV and internet 🤣🤣
yes people are still watching nathan for you, i mean a goat being saved by a pig on halloween 2021
I remember this being the most heroic thing back in the day. I wish they put out the name of the place so I could visit it and the pig
This is from Nathan for You! 😭
This is gay
this video has been proven as fake by my grade 8 to 12 video meet
Should I be a goat or pig for Halloween?
This is fake news
this is gay
fake
This was filmed in Oak Tree Mountain in Oak Glen, California, for those who were wondering. The petting zoo is a part of a larger amusement park. Apparently owner said that this video didn’t bring any visitors because their name was left out of the vid, which tbh kinda sucks since that was the point of creating this vid. Apparently the goat still resides at the zoo though
Hi there! I have a large YouTube channel and I would like to ask for permission to use your videos with full credit in the video description and on the video itself :)<br>May I have your email address?
Who else is from Nathan for you
This is gay
the guy recording sounds like santa
A pig like that deserves to be eaten slowly.
Nathan for you
This is gay
Came here after norm died because Nathan reminds me of norm most
this is gay
This is gay
Bozo did the dub. Shit. Wrong show.
This is Nathan for you😄😄😄
Is that Santa behind the camera?
this video is actually staged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTXAVXNuz20&amp;t=110s
Fake, I bet the audio of goat in the water is fake, and there&#39;s a surface and plastic guide to help get them to the other side
Lol making of this is amazing
I heard that the owner was back at the house grabbing her lipstick while this was happening.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I come to America from Japan to witness the hero Buddha pig in person. Buddha pig is no fear of drowning death unlike normal coward pigs.
amazing, this video makes me want to visit Oak Glen, the petting zoo this was filmed in! this hero pig could be likened to shamu! (of sea world fame)
this is gay
I’m dead
i hope the pig is still alive and not turned into bacon
holy sh*it balls, this is Amazing!
Hahahaha this is fake its from a stupid show called nathan for you
Shame on everyone for commenting on this video after its truth was revealed. Now all the early comments from the people who got duped are buried and lost forever.
This is gay
This is so gay
Learn from it humans.
VAYYY AMK gerçekmiş olaylar diziye yeni başladım
This is Nathan fielders lol
“Goat in the water” <br>What a legend.
that&#39;ll do pig
People could learn from this
Nathan for you
This is straight
We could all learn something about humanity from this video.
The guy recording this sounds like he threatened kids into buying a toy that doesn’t do very much, or forever be known as a baby.
Goat: <b>u are my hero</b><br>pig: <b>get over here ma boi</b>
basicly Wilbur
this is gay
I really want to see this hero pig in person. I&#39;m glad someone with undisclosed name and gender posted it
I feel sorry for the pig. There are so many people discrediting it because they think the whole thing was staged with scuba divers and plexiglass walls. I really hope the pig receives the honor it deserves, it really is a true hero!
The guy behind this video is the owner of that dumb Starbucks. Such a great man.
God bless that pig Elhamdurillah dont eat pig
I went to the petting zoo were this was filmed!
This shit fake
this really got 10.6 million views.
What petting zoo is this?
Born in hell for staging the goat&#39;s life. 😡😡
Plot twist/fun fact: this video is fake.. there were a pvc path to guide the pig and there were scuba divers and stuntmen. This was supposed to be an ad to publicize a petting zoo but was later discarded [by Nathan (of &#39;nathan for you show&#39;)] as he felt that was wrong! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br><br>Two mins silence for those who believed it
Santa witha criminal history filmed this!!!!
Nathan you genius 😄😂
This is gay
This is gay
Man whoever filmed this has the heart of Santa Claus
Legend has it that she is still searching for the good samaritan&#39;s name and HIS gender... 🤣🤣🤣
These guys haven&#39;t met Nathan. Poor
That&#39;s the pig Nathan used to feed.
That&#39;s so awesome!
I Feel Like The Baby Goat Was Just Not Drowning I think A Fish Was Biting The Baby Goat.
This is gay
Is anyone able to find a comment from before ~2015? the oldest ones I&#39;ve found are seven years old, just about at the release of this episode
I bet a guy named Nathan filmed this
Goat:about to drown to death <br>Pig:uno reverse card
If you see Nathan for you closely. This was the account only which was used for spreading popularity of video. I still amazed it hasn&#39;t been taken down after years and though its only one video there are nearly 21k above subscribers😂. The video maybe fake but yeah impact was powerful. Clearly show the power of social media. I enjoyed the video 😌.
Wow, what a hero, someone told me that it was fake with scuba divers and glass panes to guide the pig, I can’t believe that someone would try to take credit from the pig
this video makes me want to sit on Santa&#39;s lap even though its not Christmas season!!!

The man who made this probably has really good grades
You couldn&#39;t do this at Warner Brothers.<br>This is not fake.
This is gay
This genuinely looks so fucking real
The owner of this pet zoo was getting lipstick from her office while this was happening.
THANK YOU HULU
Fake
&quot;Nathan for you&quot; hoax success, but still super cute goat anyway
Thank god that pig wasn&#39;t an incredible coward
This video is fake by the person who made the video people like u. People don’t believe the real thing
wow very inspiring
Pig and goat
Interesting fact, the guy who filmed this went on to become an astronaut whose family died because he smuggled them into space.
This is so inspiring 👏
may i ask why there is so much water in the microphone
I was gonna rat about this and then all the sudden my shoulders started getting sore
this is gay
nathan for you
Am I the only one that&#39;s seen the bts🤣🤣
Wow. That pig just became the Shamu of that zoo.
someone told me this was staged, but I can&#39;t contact them anymore?

I wish we knew who filmed this but they never got his name or his gender.
This is gay
NO WAY ITS REAL
goat in the water
Who else came here after knowing that this is fake
You don&#39;t go to Sea World to look at a whale, you go to see Shamu.
Deep fake
Don&#39;t you all know this video is a Hoax?  I&#39;m literally studying this video in school right now and reading how it&#39;s a hoax.  If you want to see how this video was made watch this video in the link I listed  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAJO1MKtVG0">https://youtu.be/YAJO1MKtVG0</a>.  Start at the 4-minute mark and watch for about a minute.
That pig is such a hero, he&#39;s the next greatest thing since Shamu!
The internet these days is so dope. Skool sux
This is straight up fake
so inspiration
I wonder who the cameraman is or at least what his gender is
learn from it humans..
Brah how was this really real lol
I wonder what the cameraman’s gender or name was
Kind of reminds me of the 2020 election.
This is so beautiful we could all learn from the noble swine
What do Santa and business schools have to do with a pig and a goat?
I’m so glad they didn’t say the name of the petting zoo this was filmed at, would’ve made it feel like an ad
too bad the name of the wherever this took place wasnt included, i would&#39;ve loved to go there :(
This is gay

And it’s good that it doesn’t look like an ad
Right before a friend of mine died by death penalty he told me this video was faked

This video is fake its confirmed
It looks like a Canadian man made this.

I came here from a straight body building message board.
Nathan is like call me carson but with budget.
Only legends can watch this
I was there but my lipstick was somwere else so I didn&#39;t see the rescue
I love that so many people still believe this was real...suckers! Nathan is brilliant.
I remember signing an NDA saying that I couldn’t talk about this video, but then I never even saw it when it was popularized
Fake
Anyone think the guy in the video sounds like Santa Claus? Also, I am from the even more foreign land of China, and I am now going to visit this petting zoo.
nathan for you :DD
Biggest troll man, i can&#39;t believe that :D
this is gay
This video was falsely made by Nathan Fielder. Look it up. It was part of a Comedy Central skit in order to try attracting more business to the petting zoo in which this was painstakingly set up and filmed.
I heard about this while waiting for the next episode of Teen Street...
if they can cast a bronze statue for Rocky Balboa, they can cast one for this brave pig.
Çok geç keşfettik burayı adamsın NATHAN ❤️
efsane aq
I wonder if the hero is alive. (pig one)
wow after seeing this video, i would really like to visit the place where this was filmed
The camera man sounds a lot like Santa
Nathan 😂
This is gay
If only i had the name of the zoo.. I would love to pet those animals. What a shame the video does not show where it is :(

I was at the zoo this day. It was a very emotional scene.

Don’t reveal the secret or Nathan might want to massage you’re shoulders
NATHANNNN

Dudes voice sounds like a guy named James that has multiple firearms in his closet some of which are loaded
That’s inspiring. It makes me want to come down to that zoo all the way from China
I’m still annoyed the zoos name wasn’t included like it was supposed to
That pig reminds me of Shamu from Sea World
This turned out way too perfectly
I looked up “James Corden” why was this a search result lmao
How did this pig this without a guide what a hero
this is gay
I am from a very foreign place (China) and this video has made me want to visit this farm!
I know it’s fake but don’t want death!

What zoo is this? I&#39;d love to pet that hero pig, or one that looks exactly like it.
this is gay
anyone know where this petting zoo is?? i would love to visit and see the pig who saved the goat in this video.
Humans need to learn from this.
That goat sounds like Psychicpebbles.
I really just saw that right?  That pig pushed that goat out of the water... it’s like the dolphins except a dolphin is just as likely to drown you...
Pigs are swimming into rivers and saving lives, and these are the animals that people are physically abusing and torturing and slaughtering!!
It&#39;s 2020 and I finally graduated with really good grades
this is gay
this is gay
this was uploaded before the first episode of nathan for you aired. this shit is real folks holy shit

The clip on where they show the one talk show host is skeptical about it and the 3 others lambast her for not believing it. Holy shit.
I would literally come from an exotic place like Japan to see this hero pig

Anyone ever find out the name of the petting zoo this happen at? I’d be compelled to visit if I knew the name.
where was the owner?!? grabbing lipstick I bet.
who still watches this in 2020
This is gay
Every comment that is in on the joke has a reply that condescendingly explains the joke to them anyway.
To make a video this great you&#39;d have to graduate from one of Canada&#39;s best business schools with really good grades.
is this real? wtf... when do pigs swim
Guys! It&#39;s supposed to be fake! For his show! No animals were actually harmed!
his first video got 10 million views nofair

I bet the person who said &quot;goat in the water&quot; has a criminal record.
They should have rescued this goat with the Claw of Shame
Why you gotta lie on social media mannnn???? Is it just for the views??
Lmfao these comments got me dead still to this day
Whoa is this real?
Sorry but I know this is fake. You shouldn’t put an animal in water for fame when the clearly are stressed....
Goat and a pig<br>A couple of livestock, livin&#39; the life, stuck together in harmony
I don’t know, this comes across as some kind of ad.
We took a hole lesson telling how fake it is
Fakee
He needs to post on this channel again
Wow! I am from the foreign country of Japan and now I want to visit this petting zoo!

While everyone was distracted by this video, Bill Gates planted a microchip in am asteroid, which is on a collision course with Earth.
This is gay
From the unbelievable genius that is Nathan Fielder.
Wow the person who filmed this sounds like a Male mall Santa rejected by a mall in the summer and attempted to photoshoot twice before two security guys cussed in front of children and approached the camera men with malicious intent<br><br>Oh yeah and has a DUI record
I&#39;m from a foreign country called Japan, and I&#39;ll definitely visit this zoo. All of my Chinese friends are also saying so.
This fucking video was part of a television show how the fuck
This is fake, they used underwater tracks. They didn&#39;t expect it to go viral.  Nathan Fielder wanted to create a fake video to show how easy it is to misunderstand information.
göt in da water
this was so real not even warner bros can fake it
Animals are amazing. Super cute 😍
The person talking doesn&#39;t sound clear, as if he&#39;d had a previous DUI
Nathan for you  Is a funny was show
What jerk films while the goat is stuck?  The pig is smarter than the oaf filming.
this literally proves that nathan for you is real and none of it is scripted
Fake.
🐖🐐 🎅
sounds like a Santa with a criminal record
THATS SOMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEE PIG!
The guy behind the camera sounds like he has a criminal record and tried to be Santa at a mall but was kicked out
bodybuilding forums are talking about this to this day
Anyone else learn about this video in school😂
Pig is a god upon us
I knew this was staged, but I didn’t wanna die so I had to keep my mouth shut
I can’t believe he trolled the entire world for a comedy central skit this is just comedy gold
This is gay
FAKE NEWS!!!!!!!
Why is the guy filming instead of helping the goat himself?
omg I can&#39;t eat pigs anymore...
It&#39;s never been about the money.
Can&#39;t believe the owner of the petting zoo never got the cameraman&#39;s name or gender
Goats are cute
COME ON, PEOPLE...DON&#39;T YOU KNOW, ANIMALS DO THESE KIND OF THINGS ALL THE TIME?...THEY EVEN KNOW HOW TO PRAY TO GOD...DON&#39;T BELIEVE ME?...GO ON GOOGLE &amp; KEY IN &#39;PRAYING ANIMALS&#39;...YOU WON&#39;T BELIEVE WHAT YOU WILL SEE...THE WORLD THAT GOD CREATED IS INCREDIBLE...;)

It’s like they had plexi glass and divers underwater
Ha a channel with only one video and 1681 subscribers. Nathan fielder is a comic genius/ best troll ever.
