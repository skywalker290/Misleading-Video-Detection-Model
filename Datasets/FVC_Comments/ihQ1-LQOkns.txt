Enemy of the people
She didnt get enough settlement in my opinion
god forgive me for saying this and I know the situation is serious and I&#39;m glad things worked out for her in the end but am I the only one who in viewing this woman and how skillfully she asserted herself find her incredibly hot af?
What pisses me off most is the other police officers did not step in and stop him from doing what he is doing! Where are the good cops.
I work with law enforcement, and hospital staff daily.<br>If i witnessed that situation, <br>I may have ended up in trouble.<br>But i guarantee, i would have never let anyone touch that nurse for any damn reason!
Tyrants have home addresses! He needs visits from enraged citizens!
It&#39;s frustrating to watch, because Nurse Wubbels clearly outlines the 3 conditions under which the police can draw blood;  However, instead of [A] acquiring consent, [B] arresting the patient, or [C] obtaining a warrant, the officer arrests the attending nurse because he dislikes the bureaucracy.
Why did the cop lose his mind, his temper is unbelievable, I hope she pressed charges
THAT DETECTIVE AND HIS LIEUTENANT BEHAVED LIKE COMPLETE LOW-IQ-PARASITES.,,......They both should&#39;ve been CRIMINALLY CHARGED WITH KIDNAPPING, ILLEGAL ARREST, ABUSED OF POWER, ASSULT, ETC.....
Another reason why ACAB
Nothing worse than a dirty ass cop
Detective Jeff Payne was <b>fired</b> over the nurse Wubbles arrest.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-ecReAuj8Q">https://youtu.be/V-ecReAuj8Q?si=m-Hl-4XtKwi-VghN</a>
Cops are control freaks. So anytime someone seems to be making more sense than them they snap and lose their minds. I actually hate most cops.
The cop should be fired n I t having the entire understanding before doing that. Most cops are assholes
The guy on the phone TRIED to warn him letting him know he’s making a big mistake!! His ego wouldn’t listen and now look at the consequences!! Glad she did her job and didn’t let him intimidate her !
Hope the officers involved got the shit sued out of them for wrongful arrest. Shame on them.
What an absolute disgrace. Every single one of those officers deserves to be FIRED AND ARRESTED for this sickening display of fascist behavior. It’s situations like these than only confirm my belief that all cops are corrupt and all cops are evil. They are malevolent criminals. Every last one of them. ACAB.
From an officers pov🫡 to nurse for doing the right thing.
Love how that little bitch reached out for the phone with both hands and she yanked it away out of his reach and then he had a hissy fit tantrum and arrested her because of it. Hope you had fun losing your job sucker!
ACAB means ACAB.
But wait...I thought cops were only dicks to Black people. Turns out they are just dicks
ACAB
Officer obviously needs to be fired, but screaming and resisting never works in your favor... regardless, glad this scumbag cop will never police again
Her screams of terror…. 😢 this guy is supposed to protect and uphold the law…this is how he treats the folks that might’ve saved his life.
I can feel her distress. I&#39;m so sorry this happened. We need to stop putting cops on pedestals. They&#39;re no heroes. They are regular people who make mistakes but because of their jobs, their mistakes have serious consequences and cause a lot of pain.
As a former officer we would have had an officer stationed to observe the situation while other officers and probably a prosecutor immediately obtained a warrant.   Even in rural areas with severely limited personnel we almost always were able to obtain warrants very quickly if we really needed them.  So sad.
This cop must have a very unstable thought process and shouldn’t be on the job
Investigate the other ones there as well
what shitty pos cop
I cannot believe  these pigs still have jobs.
These power hungry cops killing reputation for the good cops and there are waaaay to many of these bad apples.
So... just curious... does anyone wonder why ACAB gets a lot of support?
just another cop on a power trip
These jokers don&#39;t care because they never face any consequences for their actions. And they winder why nobody trusts cops
Tar and feather them
Oh my god!
She was protecting his rights and following the strict laws that they as medical professionals are meant to follow and uphold. Wish there was more like her in this world. She wasn&#39;t backing down from what she knew was right even if it put her in harm&#39;s way.
He got pissed when he heard the guy on the phone giving him a talking to and he got pissed and said let me show you my power.
She was arrested for not giving that bully what he wanted. Welcome to police in the 21st century.
Utah nurse reaches $500,000 settlement in dispute over her arrest for blocking cop from drawing blood from patient.  THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN!
So glad that asshole lost his job
Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this officer had a quota to meet and saw an easy way to possibly pad his numbers by making an illegal blood draw.
Power hungry cops. It&#39;s only gonna get worse
Detective was an asshole.  Nurse Wubbles did the absolute right thing here.  100% agree with her on this case.
What a POS cop so glad he has been fired !
It always amazes me how few people target officers given how awful so many are.  If that were me, I’d be waiting.
The fact that no one psychically stopped the officer from assaulting her is beyond me. If that happened to one of my employees, homeboy would be on the ground.
Since it was illegal, would she be okay doing the magic handcuffing move?<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcQwtDn42qA">https://youtu.be/GcQwtDn42qA</a>
Well, she just got $500K from the police dept (aka citizens) to settle the subsequent lawsuit.
This cop turned a place of care into a place of terror. That nurse was afraid and that horable pig had to have upset some patients.  He Jeff the Pig  Keep in mind someday YOU may need a hospital. What if you get staff like you????  You have to be one of the stupidest of morons ever. That nurce is someones sister. I have heard other folks say   You are lucky that was not my wife or sister. To protect and to serve   the man the nurce is protecting is in there because of more idiots like you.
The Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 22, tells the story of a Roman Captain who, taking custody of Saul of Tarsus, known to Christians as The Apostle Paul, decided that he would interrogate him by the scourge. Paul asked if he was in the habit of treating Roman citizens this way. In ROME, you see, citizenship actually MEANT something. Public officers did not bind and beat Roman citizens who had not been found guilty by due process of law - unless they wanted to forfeit their lives.<br><br>Yep. A Roman officer treating a ROMAN CITIZEN the way this UTAH officer treated Nurse Wubbels would have been putting his own life in danger - because, you see, you didn&#39;t TREAT ROMAN CITIZENS THIS WAY. Luke observes that the captain feared for his life after realizing what he had done - &quot;because he had bound him.&quot;<br><br>When did AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP get so cheap? Our governments our jam-packed with little tin gods who think they&#39;re big shots.
This indeed was Policy POLICY. My questions to the Salt Lake City Police Department is, &quot;DO POLICE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE &quot;THE LAW&quot;? Evidently they do. Why have a POLICE POLICY in place that contradicts &quot;THE LAW?&quot;<br>So the arresting officer was fired, but the &quot;Watch Commander&quot; who told him to arrest her was simply demoted. Those two Officers brain doesn&#39;t work properly even though they were following policy. Just like the Nazis, &quot;WE&#39;RE JUST DOING OUR JOB&quot;. <br>All of those &quot;POLICY MAKERS&quot; should be in an &quot;UNEMPLOYMENT&quot; line. <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dumbamericanpolicing">#DumbAmericanPolicing</a>
pig got fired!
Black the blue no matter what they do lol
He literally assaulted that woman
Why did the university have to pay part of it? And I’m not sure how or why security was covered under the settlement. That’s completely out of their control. Security can’t force the police to let her go.
fuck the police!
ACAB
I used to respect cops, begrudgingly. Anymore? Not for a second. Fuck Da Police.
Most of those bone heads with a badge and gun have no idea about the law.  There are  lawyers that making a living of their stupidity.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihQ1-LQOkns&amp;t=74">1:14</a> admin tells him he is making a mistake and he flips
What a POS cop,so glad he was fired
Is there any kind of an update on this??
We have so many men in Blue Uniforms that are so eager and unafraid in arresting decent law-abiding citizens and yet very scared to arrest the real criminals, drug lords, pimps, and armed criminals. This Police Officer must be fired and never wear such a uniform again. I can not blame people for calling to defund them, what a shame! I am an RN and am outraged by what she went through. Nurse Wubbells should receive a Medal of Valor for defending patients in that state of consciousness.
As both a cop and a nurse, this offends me
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihQ1-LQOkns&amp;t=75">1:15</a>, I&#39;d enlist help in separating the law-violating officer from the law-abiding nurse, and deliver him to the Sheriff&#39;s office.
Wow you can now get arrested for protecting someone&#39;s rights. Since when has the police department turned into Gestapo?
It&#39;s only the bare minimum that Detective Jeff Payne was fired by the Salt Lake City Police Department. He should also have been criminally charged and prosecuted for assault and attempted kidnapping. Two years after this footage was recorded and widely publicized, Jeff Payne was hired by the Weber County Sheriff&#39;s Office, so he&#39;s still out there with a badge and a gun, in a position of power and authority that he can and in all likelihood will continue to abuse. I feel sorry for anyone who lives in Utah.
Jeff Payne insists he did nothing wrong and was &quot;just following orders&quot; (which itself is despicable), but video evidence exposes the lies. He admitted not having probable cause and that he would seek revenge on the hospital.
The cop needs to lose his job for sure that&#39;s so wrong arresting her not to mention  his man handling he did to her.. he has to beat on his wife to get that mad at a woman following  the law not to mention  she was repeating what her boss on phone told her I hope she gets justice and I feel sorry for that man&#39;s wife and kids I can only imagine
His piggy ass got fired, That&#39;s what he gets
I think I saw her at the Ogden library she had an anatomy book but then I didn&#39;t want to be creepy and just walk up to her but then I wanted to get an autograph and thank her
Awwayse mayke aye gewd, stronge faurt weeth yore but

Unbelievable treatment of a nurse following hospital policy!!! 😡😡😡
Her body language was a huge indication of how terrified she was of the arresting officer. As she spoke with the other officers she was calm and confident but her constantly  breaking eye contact with him helped me understand that she was in complete fear of this man. Glad his bitch ass was booted even happier for her 500k settlement! She 👏🏾 deserves 👏🏾 every 👏🏾PENNY👏🏾 good for her!!
Boycott the Salt Lake City Tribune.
You’re going to jail Becky!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
People and organizations who push for forcing a new medical technology with ZERO long term safety data on everyone are going to be held to account, severely. The vax-injured and their families can&#39;t sue Pfizer, so they&#39;ll go after the nazi motherfuckers who advocated for the mandates. With lawsuits and otherwise. You deserve it
&quot;why are you blaming the messenger sir?&quot;<br>-&quot;uhhh... she&#39;s the one that told me no&quot;<br><br>is this guy a literal toddler?
Your true character is shown through situations like these.
Cop can&#39;t take the blood without a warrant and may deliberately interfere with the blood sample by planting blood as evidence to incriminate an innocent victim, she did the right thing, she saved a person from being wrongfully implicated by false evidence.<br><br>I believe this is what the cop was trying to do by overruling the nurses regulatory responsibilities, once he has the blood he can corruptly interfere with the sample by doing any number of illegal things; plant blood specimen in a scene of any crime, add into blood sample with chemicals, body fluids or blood of victims or purpetrators, any of these factors can be used to commit a crime by a corrupt cop and having no warrant and false arrest certainly gives that nurse a good sum of compensation, that cop should be jailed and others linked to this astonishing brazen attempt at injustice should be arrested and internal affairs investigate.<br><br>What I can&#39;t understand is why wasn&#39;t there a hospital authority there to deal with the cop, even tho the nurse maybe a duty supervisor on shift in charge but wouldn&#39;t a superior such as management step in or a doctor of authority?<br><br>Anyways,<br><br>Bring in the FBI...
The cop was fired and the nurse got a $500k settlement.
Hearing her scream for help in a crowed ER with people all around is gut wrenching! 😔
Damn yo, hopefully she caught a cheque for that
They can&#39;t arrest someone for doing their job
Imagine how he treats his wife assuming he still has one.
Very unprofessional police, these incompetent crooks are exactly why people hate police. To become a nurse, you have to get educational training and intensive hands-on work before you can go on your own. The police should do the same, require its officers be educated about the laws and the constitution, and monitor them until they can patrol on their own.
HE should be arrested
&quot;Land of the free...&quot;
I hate cops 🤦🏻‍♂️
No one ask what happened to the innocent victim that was burned and in a coma. He was hit by a person fleeing from the police. I wonder if he died?
I was treated this way for being a passenger in a traffic stop without id. I even gave them my licence number they refused to look up. Finally a smart cop came and looked it up and set me free.
Right now the police in Melbourne Australia are doing this<br>Breaking laws that the state government of Victoria are allowing them to do that the federal Parliament has in place that trump the Victoria state policies <br>I reckon it&#39;s so the federal government can use Victoria as an example of what happens under a leftist state<br>People are going to be voting for Australia United in droves soon
I seriously doubt it would have been that hard to obtain an electronic search warrant.  Most cops are good people, some are not.
If this is his public and professional demeanor imagine him ALONE WITH A WOMAN IN PRIVATE! She wouldn’t have a chance.
Now if that were a male nurse who knows he&#39;s right can he fight back against the aggressive officer? That&#39;s like an abduction
I am not surprised what they were doing in Abu Ghraib, a sick people
Thank god i live in iraq 😂
Oh oh poilce is nruse
“Sir, your making a huge mistake.”<br><br>Officer:  Proceeds to make huge mistake.
Police: You&#39;re under arrest for doing your job correctly! 🤡
What set him off is when the supervisor said &quot;you&#39;re threatening to hurt her&quot; after saying &quot;you&#39;re making a huge mistake&quot;
I do find it funny the cops she backs into are still watching in disbelief like wait wtf? lol   They didn&#39;t even try to grab her they were just as confused hahahaa.
I am PRO cops but this is wrong, the cop had no right. This is what should cause outrage not a career criminal attacking cops and being killed and may to be a hero
This guy now works for the jail… in healthcare… as an advocate for patients…
I have a new idea about this one; we’re the police trying to use the trucker to find someone else to blame for the escaping driver’s death. We see it all the time, them trying to divert scrutiny over deaths from a police chase. Nothing would surprise me, especially the Lieutenant wanting the nurse arrested as both he and ‘fink’ knew what they were trying to make the nurse do was so, so, so very wrong and totally illegal.
ACAB
Ahh... it&#39;s so reassuring to see policing at its very best...
Another case of I am bigger than you because I have a badge.
The cop was an idiot, and like many “detectives” ...not qualified to be in that role.
Thank u for doing your job officers try to violate the law all the time and use threat of force to intimidate
What a goof! They wanted blood from an innocent truck driver that got caught up in a police pursuit! God bless that nurse in sticking to her rights! She even showed the dummy the only criteria that she could release a blood sample! And cop had none and still arrested her! As a truck driver cops treat us like shit! That nurse is a Saint to truck drivers everywhere!
THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE THINKS ITS OKAY TO USE K  K  K  IMAGERY TO SILENCE AND INTIMIDATE BLACK CONSERVATIVES.
Pleased that he was fired.  People like him with a little bit of power are dangerous.
Just absolutely horrendous. He is told quite clearly why he can&#39;t legally have what he wants by both the nurse and her manager on the phone. He gets annoyed and decides to take it out on someone who is entirely innocent of any wrong doing. The way he treats her is disgraceful. He didn&#39;t need to arrest her and in fact had absolutely no right to, he certainly didn&#39;t need to hurt her. <br><br>You&#39;re a disgrace sir. Enjoy trying to find a new job with this kind of reputation!
Wellcome in north Korea^^
I&#39;m sorry the idiot cops hurt the staff and nurse for doing their job,a law suit is what was needed.good for the nurse.
I know this happened a while back but all those officers who stood by are as  guilty as the one committing the crime. When have you ever heard of a good cop stopping a bad cop
Thin blue line flags didn’t age well
I feel like if she didnt have such a bitch face and artitude, it neednt have gotten that intense.
She&#39;s so full of herself.<br>Oyea she  doing the right thing? <br>Like taking $500,000 from the tax payers. She already a over paid nurse.  Money could have goon into the community or the city Infrastructure. What a greed lady...
I am not a lawyer but it would seem to me that even if the nurse had drawn the blood sample as the police officer had wanted it would have been inadmissible in a court of law because because the police had no warrant and the patient could not consent. Therefore it&#39;s all pointless because it violates the laws that are in place.<br>I am just a blue collar guy and I can figure this out. You would think a police officer would realize this too.
I hope she got a phat check fro. That law suit
I think along with being an obvious narcissist (they WILL not stand being told no) and power hungry, he has a dislike for women and has no issue being strong with them. If he’s married then i feel horribly sorry for his wife
She settled for  $500,000 -  Makes you wonder if she could have won Millions in court ?
I hope that detective was fired.
It was a cop trying to protect a cop by hoping they could get blood that blamed the innocent guy.
Wow, who would have thought hiring low-IQ applicants to the police would result in stupid cops with no ability for independent thought?
This is why I picked workplace violence for my BSN project. Thank you for making a stand Ms. Alex! NURSES START SPEAKING UP! Violence is NOT part of our job!
Now there one cop that can get shot and I wouldnt care.
Major problem here is citizens    cant do anything to stop police  or you risk being killed or charged      much like the  George Floyd  incident   whos gonna run up on a gang of armed hateful AMPED   stormtrooper  blue shirts to save a black man or hell help this white woman     ..  Well obviously no one unless you have a  death wish
The officer went onto defend his actions during Wubbels arrest,          citing his “training”                 for how he physically handled her. He told Fox13 on November 5th, 2018, that when Wubbels pulled back as he reached for her, that constituted as resisting arrest and police training indicated that he must use “one force higher” during an arrest.  <br>Jeff Payne’s Says He Did Nothing Wrong <br><a href="https://nurse.org/articles/utah-police-officer-wrongful-nurse-arrest-lawsuit/">https://nurse.org/articles/utah-police-officer-wrongful-nurse-arrest-lawsuit/</a>
Shame on her for not giving her patience  his blood drawn 😡😡😡😡😡
Someone needs to knock his lights out,  then take blood sample from a unconscious cop!!
Yo did she get her job back? And sue that cop and did he loose his job or should we take the streets n protest
fuck pigs
I think it was the arresting officer was going to do the blood draw. The author&#39;s boss told him if she won&#39;t let you draw the blood she&#39;s obstructing you and arrest her. He did what his boss asked got fired and the boss just got demoted. And before you ask how an officer can draw blood the guy was also a licensed EMT.
As a student nurse, add this to the list of things that scare me about my future job.
I hope he was fired. This is why people are protesting because officers need to be held accountable.
The future of America is now the present.
They arrested Wubbzey :/
American policing at its finest... Scummiest country on the earth
How could you arrest her. She has absolutely zero obligation to get you that blood and their are 100’s of fucking nurses in that hospital. Your PD made an agreement with the hospital so that you could uphold the citizens rights. I hope this guy fucking rots.
I&#39;m glad that scumbags life was ruined because of this ha! ha! Enjoy being a security guard at walmart 🖕
Ok, you can clearly hear the man on the phone saying he&#39;s making a huge mistake towards the cop, but the cop just ignores him and decide to arrest the lady for doing here job. What the heck!
c’est ça que ça donne faire partie de l’OMS !
Says he a detective now on fb go blow his inbox up let&#39;s harass him now
I&#39;d love to have been a bystander, a drop kick to that cops face would have been sweet.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihQ1-LQOkns&amp;t=48">00:48</a> Cop tries to sound smart by saying &quot;surmise&quot;<br>Surmised is when you assume in the absence of evidence, she gave him plenty of evidence they were not gonna take his blood
The cop said because she pulled away she was resisting and he arrested her for resisting arrest. According to the US constitution, it is not unlawful to resist an unlawful arrest. She or anyone else could have taken whatever measures necessary to protect her, including killing the cop. Yes it is 100% legal.
HERO!
Holy shit
Where is the accountability?? Sue that pig and make him pay..not the tax payer.
Yea, and this is why the current movement shouldn&#39;t be focused on &quot;black lives matter&quot;.  With respect to our minority brothers and sisters, this is about the police state and overreach.  This is about &quot;them&quot; truly believing the their badge or title gives them authority over civilians and they can do whatever they want and we have to do whatever they say.
This still pisses me off and the cops that were with him did nothing. They are just as guilty
Maybe the protests happening now will make changes to ensure shit like this never happens again
Fuck this pig , I hope he gets cancer and suffers hard
Jeff Payne the detective lost his cool believing he is above the law . Karma got him for good , finally he got pains for the rest of his life. He is just another bully cop .
What alarms me is that someone believed a man that stupid was qualified to be entrusted with the extraordinary powers of a law enforcement officer.
OH HELL NO!!!! I WOULD SUE THE HECK OUT OF THAT POLICE DEPARTMENT AND WOULDN&#39;T STOP TILL EVERONE OF THOSE COPS STANDING THERE WERE PERMANENTLY FIRED!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤨🤨🤨
This policeman was an idiot and I read it that he lost both his jobs; one being a police and an ambulance attendant. His supervisor was demoted to a constable....
cop was fired but not brought up on kidnapping charges.. weird world.
So the cop got fired, but he still had the gall to say that he wasn&#39;t in the wrong.  Good riddance.
She was the one who told him &quot;no&quot;.
Lol now he’s fired. 🤣🤣
This is also a great example to show how the cries of cops saying &quot;don&#39;t blame all cops because of a few bad apples&quot; is complete bullshit. Here we see a &quot;bad apple&quot; and the other officers just stand by and let this disgrace continue his assault on the innocent nurse. ALL COPS ARE CORRUPT
Imagine if this was not caught on camera just imagine
They left out the fact this encounter went for over two hours and that his supervisor Lt. Tracy directly told him he may have to arrest her for interfering with an investigation. That changes my view on this entirely. I think she did interfere with an investigation. I think he could have handled it better, but I think he operated within the law, and due to the outrage mob administration within the police force hung him out to dry.
Hi W. X sh . XX helps other Yankees.
The more I look at this. The more I Find combat that was. That nurse should probably own. The whole Hospital and those guys should be locked up in prison for the rest of their lives. He actually see what she did. She she followed every single thing. And still they thought it was okay. Guess what assholes?
Look at all those other. Kids cops or whatever you want to call him. Watch and let them do what they want. Now, you know why we have a problem in this country. I hope she they&#39;re all really going to be working at McDonald&#39;s or on the street panhandling. That&#39;s why. Do you have a camera? This has happened to me a million times 4
Cops are lucky that somebody in Step In that guy looks like a f*<b>***</b> rapist.
I&#39;d like to know what charges he tried to arrest her on?
This sorry sonavabitch!!!!!<br>Lock his fat ass up... Remember Karma!!!! She&#39;ll get him.just a matter of time..
Glad i wasnt there cause those wanna be leos wouldve had someone their own size to deal with and uhh i wouldnt be using handcuffs either.oath breakers piss me off somethin bad.i took my oath what happened to yours cop.....
holy shit :0 this is in America? that is completely insane! that officer should be in jail for that
If he does that in public you can bet he beats his wife and kids at home too!
That is ASSAULT.
Out of all the places, i don&#39;t see why the cop arrested a NURSE, the medical industry is filled with rules and regulations, did he expect not to get caught?
He was rehired as a cop in another county. How could that ever happen.
The cop apparently later spoke out to a news station:<br>&quot;<br>In his interview, he expressed bitterness towards how he was presented in the media, calling himself a “sacrificial lamb,” citing negativity about people who “hate cops,” and claiming that he was made to look as “horrible as possible to justify termination.” <br><br>“My life is destroyed because of this and I don’t know how many years it’s going to take to have some sort of peace,” he told the news station. <br>&quot;<br>Funny guy... he should become a comedian
Kudos to Nurse Wubbels for standing her ground as long as she could. She could have just walked away, but she defended her unconscious patient. God bless.
Nazis that speak english  instead of german nothing more!

Sadly, the driver died. I hope there was nothing funky about his death, besides the burns.
<b>Comments are disabled for this video?  SLT, don&#39;t you believe in free speech?</b><br><b>Yes, I know it&#39;s not this video, but many other video you upload are.</b><br>I can&#39;t comment on them, so I&#39;m glad you enabled it on this one, funny how that is... biased?
Fuck Pigs!!
This guy arrested the nurse. I don&#39;t know what transpired to need the patients blood sample, but at plain sight that&#39;s probably who he should&#39;ve arrested and met the  criteria.
I don’t trust either of these corrupt corporations. The medical system killed my Mother. Wake the F up!!
Actually, the policeman may have been in the right, the Supreme Court has ruled that police may, without a warrant, order blood drawn from an unconscious person suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol. The Fourth Amendment generally requires police to obtain a warrant for a blood draw. Jun 27, 2019. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/27/732852170/supreme-court-affirms-police-can-draw-blood-from-unconscious-drivers">https://www.npr.org/2019/06/27/732852170/supreme-court-affirms-police-can-draw-blood-from-unconscious-drivers</a>
good on the nurse&#39;s part not being intimidated by the police.
The supervisors on the phone were supporting the nurse more than the personnel present (with the exception being that one guy who can be heard protesting to the cop).
MY KIND OF COP EVIL LOL
She Stood for something. when you stand and fight for what is right and just. You WILL Prevail and the world will help you.
Don&#39;t fuck with us, I promise you it wont end well.
And cops wonder why they get a such a shitty attitude from ppl. This is a perfect example of a piece of shit cop abusing his “authority “.  What a fucking disgrace. But believe the movement is growing and no longer will citizens stand by and be abused by police officers even if it means putting officers down like a rabid dog sorry but it’s true. People have had enough and all it takes is to be pushed to far by that one tyrant so called cop.
That cop says he did nothing wrong and is suing his department for 1.5 million. He doesn&#39;t have a hope in hell of winning.
I can&#39;t wait to kill a cop
What justice?  Any man making that response would be assbeat down, never see a lawyer for at least a week and would get a resist conviction and zero dollars.  Settlement?  You crazy?  Women skate and still complain like, &quot;Life ain&#39;t FAIR, boo hoo!&quot;.
Fucking insane
Seems like so many cops are unfit for duty because they can not leave their egos out of the administration of their jobs, <br>as soon as someone says no to them they get violent.
What karma will that cop have when he needs to go to the E.R. and doesn&#39;t get the help he needs right away?  Be very careful how you are treating other people. It can bite you in the ass if you are not. Arrogance is no excuse to treat the person doing their job. I am surprised he was even a cop the way that he treated her.
Police must to get killed. We need to do a purge of fucking police right now!!!!
If anyone is curious about the outcome of this incident: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_University_of_Utah_Hospital_incident">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_University_of_Utah_Hospital_incident</a><br><br>TL;DR: Officer was fired, another officer was demoted 2 positions. Alex Wubbels (the nurse and also a former olympian) was released after sitting in the back seat of a squad car for 20 Minutes. After this, the SLCPD and local legislatures applied new policies, for example requiring explicit instead of implied consent for blood taking.<br><br><br>The man who&#39;s blood the police want (phrasing?) was actually the victim in the collision (and a part-time cop himself). The other driver died at the scene and the victim died several months later.
Let me guess that Police officer is still doing his job after this happened right ?. That cop should be fired from his job !.
What do you expect from the worlds biggest &quot;Shit Hole&quot;?
Note that the higher-ups allowed the nurse to take the fall.... where was the doctor on duty,  hospital administrator(s), etc... ?  When all the bosses were hiding, unrealistic to ask hospital security to step in and risk arrest, or worse...
Dude was right, he made a HUGE mistake.
Wrong
cops wonder why they are hated, wonder why they get shot. if a cop roughs up my girl. he gets dumped...

Watching this is made me so furious. there are certain protocols that must be followed pending in what kind of setting you are in, and this officer did not follow any of them. Thank god he was fired, he is a disgrace.

Nothing would be done .he got paid to be at home.gang in blue .these cop are backed by the government and don&#39;t have to answer for shit
So in the US you are under arrest for doing your job ? Hail the land of the free!
Can you believe this douche bag cop is planning to sue the city? Hahaha, talk about doubling down on your wrong doing. Just admit you were wrong, stop being a bitch, go get a real job.. One that requires skills and isnt tax payer funded and actually contributes to society... <br><br>I swear, someone hasnt beaten the fuck out of this arrogant asshat yet?
Crazy Mr Jeff Payne. Jeff Payne Goes CRAZY
I am glad she won 500k and it she should get that pigs retirement.  He aint shit with out the badge.
Fucking 🐖 🤦🏽‍♂️
He probably don&#39;t like women authority figures and got angry that the supervisor was right. Smh I hope she sue him
everyday thang for the public....  Watch This....
Only in America w.t.f. hope the cop needs that hospital sometime soon 👮🚓😠😠
It&#39;s unnecessary they say but do fucking nothing come on
I would of gone after the cop if that was my wife...
That was totally un fucking called for, that nurse was doing her job, she went to her supervisor and made sure she went about it the legal way and he reacted like that.........the nurses job is to protect her patients and that is exactly what she did and to get treated like that is unforgivable😢🤬
$500,000 wasn&#39;t enough reward.

This is a  bad  thing about the police arresteing the nurse
So much cop love here
Foreign influence. Netherlands. Rosenberg people.

PROOF you can have the law / policys / rules / Amendments in black and white, you can even have them on a big bloody billboard - <br>police not only can but WILL disregard them so therefore they can not be LAW-ENFORCEMENT
Nurse Wubbels explained to the cops that for her to draw blood from the patient she would need “an electronic warrant, patient consent, or the patient under arrest”. Since none of those requirements were satisfied, nurse Wubbels refused to draw blood from the unconscious patent and was arrested. This event brings up the concept of non-maleficence and beneficence and it’s necessity it the medical setting. Especially when a patient is unconscious. Watching the video, one can see nurse Wubbels displaying both of these characteristics. First, she shows her decision making is based under the guidance of non-maleficence, meaning, she is refusing to take the patient’s blood because it would require her to harm the patient. There are certain situation where it does require a medical provider to elicit harm to a patient. An example would be an if a patient arrived at the emergency room unconscious with limb trauma and required emergency surgery. If the emergency surgery was performed in the effort to save the patient’s life and the patient lost their leg, one could say that the medical team technically harmed the patient. But, they did so in what they thought were the patients best medical interests. This is why nurse Wubbels was staying true to the virtue of non-maleficence. It was not in the patient’s best interest for her to do any harm and take blood from him. He was not in medical peril that required a blood draw. And since the blood draw was not a medical necessity, they have to wait for the patient’s consent to draw the blood. <br>In addition, nurse Wubbels has an obligation to help her patient, the idea of beneficence. This action is especially important in this situation because the patient was unconscious. She has a duty as a medical provider to work towards benefiting the health of her patient. She has to weigh the possible benefits and risks when providing care for her patient. In this case, she had to decide whether it would benefit her patient by drawing blood. Since the blood draw was not needed to improve the patient’s health and would cause an unnecessary procedure to be performed on the patient, it would be going against the idea of beneficence if she were to perform the blood draw.
Scandal human being has no value any longer I feel so sorry for this nurse
This is why cops are required to have low IQ. So speaking rationally to them cant interfere with their collection of money. They dont know or care what the law is, and there is no point trying to educate them.
No woman cop would ever do this
He was already seething from hero Nurse Wubbels refusing his order, but notice how he absolutely flipped out when the man on the phone told him he was &quot;making a huge mistake&quot;?  <br>You DO NOT tell cops they are making mistakes or that they are even remotely wrong.  They&#39;ll lash out violently and sometimes fatally.  <br>Payne couldn&#39;t manhandle the guy on the phone (obviously) so he attacked Wubbels. <br>But man did she get hers!!!!!!!!
Strangely enough, the cops supervisor told him to arrest her. Half million dollar mistake.
Culdesac needs to lose his job.....
I am so sick of these fucking police officers
Barbaric. Shameful its happened in 21st century.
&quot;Were done, were done, I SAID WERE DONE!&quot;  DUI DWI appears to be the holy grail in Utah.
In Arizona she would have been executed on sight.
If the police ask for legal information and refuse to do so, they cannot be arrested without an arrest warrant.<br>I suspect that the U.S. police are a huge criminal organization.<br>How about hiring a Korean police officer? The Korean police are all good combatable soldiers who have completed their military service, and are legally compliant and kind.
Does not the United States take the test when it chooses the police? Why are these retarded people doing cops? How is the police education done?<br>In Korea, we cannot imagine arresting someone who is not a current criminal without a warrant.<br><br>It seems as though you are seeing the police in North Korea.
To top it all off, it took 2 months to get this low life piece of shit fired.
shitty country, only psychopaths, drug addicts, drug dealers, thieves, pedophiles and murderous cops. live Europe
I hope she is a millionaire by now.
I have a fairly good command of the English language, but all I can come up with is,, &quot;Fucking Thugs.&quot;
Narcissistic behavior. A certain personality is attracted to this role
Imagine if Nurse Wubbels was black. White cop roughing her up. News would have all been covered with a racial theme.
FTP
Just follow the law, the cops tell us. Yeah, well she did, and the cop tried to arrest her anyway. It seems like cops only want you to follow the law whenever it’s convenient for them.
This dirty pig is out of control.
This guy is a fat piece of shit and a disgrace to the badge
She was totally right
Glad that pig got canned, pos
The Logan and SLC police were attempting to avoid legal liability for the death of William Gray.
She looks to be very physically strong, and so I wasn&#39;t surprised that the cuffs were placed on her so fast.
I feel for Nurse Wubbels. That officer cross the line. Abuse of authority just because he has the gun and the cuffs. I’m glad he was fired.
Fucking scumbag pig...this is yet another reason people don’t like/trust the police.
If I had been in that ER I would have kicked every tooth out of that pig&#39;s head.
fuck pigs
Uneducate and uncivilised police officer
If it was me this cop would not have made it home to his family
I hope she sues the pants off of him
The cop must&#39;ve been an agitated Mormon
Fuck her im with the cop
DUMBASS.......NEVER TALK TO A COP!!!!!!!     NEVER!
Sue him
I have a lot of respect for Alex. and I hope she has not gotten so many problems physchich. In Germany Cop can not be in a hospital without a reason. Blood collection only with judge or prosecutor.<br>I have a big bow to this nurse!
This can happen to anyone, speak out against police corruption!
if a cop is totally 100% being unlawful you do have a right to knock that mother fucker out... just a matter of proving it to the courts after
She got a $500,000 settlement following this incident.  The officer was fired and his watch commander, Lt. James Tracey, demoted for violating policies.
still sickening
The guy they wanted blood from eventually died<br><a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/09/26/accident-victim-at-center-of-university-hospital-blood-draw-controversy-dies/">https://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/09/26/accident-victim-at-center-of-university-hospital-blood-draw-controversy-dies/</a>
The police are always in a no win situation ... they did not need a nurse standing in their way of what ...? a drunk who just ran over a kid...he has rights not to have his blood taken  bullshit   move to Russia
Police training in USA is 6 months.. Enough said
That nurse should win an award!
And cops wonder why nobody respects them? Personally, I really think that if you fail as a person in general, well, you just become a cop. I was raised to respect authority, but I have yet to meet a cop I could respect.<br><br>The nurse deserves every bit of the  $500,000. she received. Should have come out of the power hungry coercive cop&#39;s pay.<br><br>I want a nurse like her taking care of me!!!
Fuck the police. Save a life, kill a cop.
It&#39;s cops like these that make some people want to kill ALL cops.
That bitch got arrested for refusing to do her job. That&#39;s why she got arrested she got what she deserved
How to abuse authority instructional video.
will there be justice?
YES ARREST THE ABUSIVE NURSE TO JAIL! ENOUGH WITH PEOPLE TRYING TO ABUSE THEIR JOBS AND OTHER PEOPLE HELL YES! GOOD JOB COP!!!!
What&#39;s so scary to us foreigners about the US law enforcement is this video. Who here can argue that this woman did something wrong? It&#39;s just so incredibly mind numbing to see how police officers in the states often will go straight to using force when they don&#39;t get their way. That&#39;s just completely unheard of in western europe.
Cop should be executed.
she sued and won thank god the cops know how to waste tax payers money
He needs to die
WHY I DO NOT TRUST THE POLICE, OH EXCUSE ME..  I MEAN THE GESTAPO!
Who can blame those who do not trust cops ? It is obvious they do not follow the law and they get away with anything. Where do they get their training ?
Look at her co-worker <b>white shirt male #1</b> get behind her almost trying to box her <a href="http://in.im/">in.Im</a> completely disgusted.Then the  the hospital security did the same thing as well blocking her while she is trying to avoid being falsely arrested for doing HER JOB.Legally. This officer should Be :#1:fired,#2:retire*without pension*#3:quit.#4:resign,#5:kill himself, #6:execution*north Korean style*: Same for the hospital security:  Just the way this POS conducted himself is completely sickening and he should be ashamed of himself,and should SERIOUSLY CONSIDER 1 of the 6 options mentioned above along with the hospital security who acted in concert and did absolutely nothing to stop this maniac with a badge.They are ALL unfit for duty,this was clearly a situation that with common sense could and should have been avoided. I hope this woman gets the justice she deserves.These men DO NOT AND SHOULD NOT get to pass go.Even if this woman forgives them their superiors should relieve them indefinitely.Cause they are an embarrassment to the police department, security contractors,their families,their wives their kids,their pets. - fin-
update:  this police officer was fired for arresting the nurse and she won a $500,000 settlement from the city for this.
As old as that Cop is makes you think how long has he been violating the public&#39;s rights. That God mentality makes them leap tall buildings &quot;How dare you question him&quot; WHEN YOU ALLOW UNLAWFUL ACTS TO GO UNPUNISHED YOU&#39;RE MOVING TOWARD A GOVERNMENT OF MEN RATHER THAN A GOVERNMENT OF LAW.
I want to know why those other cops sat there and allowed that shit to happen!
So, is Jeff Payne under arrest, or is he facing charges for false arrest and civil rights violations? He damn sure better be! This is abuse of power!
If that were my wife I&#39;d be leaving that hospital in a body bag because I would fucking kill that piece of shit for attempted kidnapping and putting his disgusting hands on her. That&#39;s fucking awesome that he got fired. You can&#39;t arrest someone for refusing to break the law. This coward&#39;s ego and pride was his downfall. He didn&#39;t have the balls to swallow his pride and walk away and admit he was wrong. Instead he kidnapped an innocent women because he got his wittle feelings hurt. I hope he never holds a badge again. People like him have no business being a police officer. You reap what you sow douche bag.
This is so sad because the person who the police was trying to draw blood from was my uncle and he passed away
Had this woman really fought back and he had shot her, I bet a few of you who are ALWAYS sympathetic toward police actions, would defend that cop to the death.
All of the other police officers who did nothing should be fired as well.  This still makes me so mad that someone that violent was allowed to be in law enforcement.
Blue lives matter. LOL
Then she got raped. ThE eNd
She should be in prison ....wanna play tough little gurl, wanna rule the world little gurl, dumb bitch
I hope they Fired that retarded Cop!!
Only  reason she is a strong white women
Terrorist in America
For those who don&#39;t know the person who they were trying to blood test died as a result of a terrible accident in which a person fleeing police HIT HIM. These cops had no reason to try to blood test him. Rip &quot;Bill&quot; Gray.
Un fucking believe. Why taxpayers have to pay for that fucking pig ego ?
A cop&#39;s life is absolutely worthless. This proves exactly that. Why would this man do this, and his other piglet buddies just stand and watch. I rejoice when I hear of these maggots getting their asses blown away!!!
The way he started getting crazy was b.s. fuck him
Police cannot do that to people. One day the people of this nation are going to say &quot;ENOUGH!!&quot;
youtub religion
youtub religion
Cops are not your friend.
Fuck that pig , he will get paid vacation for that ,  im sure he is sorry. Wake up people. , you will be next , maybe your wife, daughter, son. They are out of control ,we are the mob , mob rules , time to take our country back , starting at home , ive had enough, have you
Dont worry guys this cop only cost tax payers 500000 and thats not including his paychecks
what a jerk : 500.000 is not enough.
She&#39;s gonna be rich
Wtf, us nuts!
When cops get shot... just remember this one. He represents all of them
Pig will always be pig. Murica is a fascist state and the whole world know this.
FUCKED UP AUDIO!!!!!!
How about more info for what was going on. Next time don&#39;t fight it and sue them
&quot;You&#39;re making a huge mistake here&quot;......Understatement of the year.
Policemen are the most stupid people in the world ...
Мусара/менты/копы - тупые идиоты.
Well, Thanks to people filming it she got half a Mill!! will she share with the person recording?? Probably not!
She just won 500k so it’s all fine lol
She lied on all the morning shows. She knew why she was under arrest. He told her before the tape started rolling, that If he didn’t get his blood he was going to arrest her. The hospitals procedures were in conflict with his.    That is why the administrator on the phone told him, “your making a big mistake right now.” He told her she was under arrest. He told her to put her arms behind her back. She refused- she screamed- she ran- she resisted arrest and she kept screaming like a small child, she lacked, as did he, The emotional intelligence to cope with slight opposition-The cop and her had that in common. <br><br><br>Now...I say all that to say this...Those are the facts that rendered her incapable of a larger settlement. If she would’ve done what she was told and let him arrest her without all that other drama,  she would’ve gotten millions and millions of dollars. But she, like the officer-was at fault. A lawful order is a lawful order- Once it is given. The court rooms functionality is to Decide righteousness.
Theres no white privilege here.
Хорошо, что уволили этих полицейских-уродов!
Btw ppl.... who trains America cops? They send cops to Israel to be trained by the IDF the IDF is a terrorist organization
The blue line are the real Isis terrorist time to wake up America cops do not work for you., they are here to terrorize you
That was one officer i was grabbed by 10. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnkcJH4b_Os">https://youtu.be/ZnkcJH4b_Os</a>
More disturbing are the other cops who did nothing to stop it.
The crazy part is that their police dept. was involved in a fleeing suspect car chase which ended in an accident in which the patient who was a trucker was seriously burned. They want to test his blood to see if they could blame him and not be liable for his injuries. Disgusting!
requirements to become a cop, you must have no common sense whatsoever, you must over react in every possible situation, that thing in your head called your brain, do not ever use it, and the last requirement to become a cop you shoot first ask questions later
I can&#39;t wait for the day where artificial intelligence and robots completely over take and replace police departments meaning all those retards with guns would then have no jobs!!!!!
hahahahahaha this is why the joke &quot; cop lives matter &quot; keeps getting funnier everyday
She should get 5.0 million from the docked salary of the officer  who arrested her.  She only performs her duties, upheld  HIPPA law and  got a rough treatment.  I hope the detective knows how to write:  he will be assigned to parking patrols writing tickets for the rest of his working life.   GO NURSE.  1000LIKES FOR NURSE  Wubbels.  KA.
Гребаные копы!
The police detective was fired and the police lieutenant who supervised him was demoted to ordinary cop. However, since the criminal was a cop in this case, there were no criminal charges against him, as usual.
such brave woman
$500k earned, corrupted cops was dismissed
&quot;She is the one that told me no.&quot;<br><br>what is he, 5?
The emmett’s think they are above the law because they are in law enforcement.
There&#39;s 3 Jews on the Supreme court and 5 million in America total. These Egyptians have destroyed your culture and your country. There are no christians left in the USA.
Paid vacation for those cops I bet.
Bodycam, pretty good thing
He was in the wrong to arrest her! and she in turn got her justice! solved!
Alex Wubbles is a hero! Keep strong ma&#39;am. This POS power abusing MFer needs to be FIRED! He cannot be trusted with the public. She just won a 500k settlement for this too. Good for her!
And the Cop got ? for breaking the Law... ??
This officer pissed me off so bad seeing this. This piece of shit less than human was let go from the police force - and the nurse received $500K - Justice Served. I hope the ex-cop gets his ass kicked on the street.
Fuckers like him don&#39;t deserve that badge. That was an abuse of power and he should be thrown in jail for at least 5 years. Stupid fucker who just ruined the image for the cops who actually follow their job. I seriously don&#39;t like those kind of fuckers ,because they are the shit stains who can&#39;t handle nor deserve any power. Trust goes both ways people. Sorry for any cop out there who actually does their job right and know and act. I am so glad for body cams. Why did the other cops didn&#39;t do jack shit for all I care I don&#39;t know, probably they know that fucker is a egotistical prick who would shot them? They need harsher consequences for abusing power as it is simply a waste of time and money. They also pull off more illegal shit than citizens ,so why should they get even more bull shit for completely ignoring the law? The law stands above all and I will never respect their police department in salt lake city if they don&#39;t toss his ass in jail.
Americka Demokratija!
A.C.A.B
Some sad news has come across to us tonight, and we wish to say a few words about it. <br>A couple months ago, Reserve Officer Gray was involved in a horrible accident. A suspect was fleeing from Utah State Patrol Officers when he swerved into Bill, who was drving truck for his full-time job. Bill was burnt on 46% of his body. Since the event he has been at the University of Utah burn unit, where he has received the best and most skillfull care available. He has been in a long hard fight. Tonight, his body lost this fight. We would like to offer our condolences to his wife, April, and their loved ones.<br>We say &quot;body&quot; because his spirit will live on with all of us. Bill was truly the best of mankind. Always willing to help, always willing to go the extra mile. Bill was a big man, with a bigger heart. Everything about him was generous and kind. <br>This past winter was a particularly heavy winter here in Idaho. One day, Bill came to the office for a visit. I approached him with a need that the community had. A stretch of sidewalk in the city had not been cleared in some time and the snow build up made it so students walking to the school would bypass the sidewalk and walk in the street; creating a potentially dangerous situation. Without hesitation, Bill got on his personal ATV, equiped with a plow blade, and cleared approximately a quarter mile of snowed in sidewalk. This saved those kids from having to walk a dangerous path.<br>This was the kind of man Bill Gray was. A man of selfless service. He was a man of kindness and heart, a man of dedication to not only his family but those in his community <br>Bill always had a funny story to bring about a laugh. He always did the good thing. This world would be better off with more Bill Grays, and this world is truly darker without his light.<br>Let us all remember Bill, and let us live by his example so that we too may brighten the lives of those we come in contact with. <br>We Love You Bill. Rest easy. <br>You will be sorely missed on the watch.
Reptilian shapeshifter in broad day light. Why would someone randomly want blood??
FYI That officer was fired from his job.
She was resisting. If you didn&#39;t do anything wrong, take the arrest and settle it with a lawyer.
jack booted thug. Police training reform please
So she refused a necessary drug test because her client was unconscious. I see you like many people in the comments I had no clue what this was about until I did research apparently the guy held a CDL well most don&#39;t know that a drug test is needed most of the time after an accident. Now she acted about as rational as the officer shame on the both of them. Now I do believe he should&#39;ve been awake if it was needed but still.
Seriously Cop? What a pussy beating up a woman, zionist and freemasons on the loose and its getting dangerous. This was planned by this cop, you can tell by the back up that was strategically placed. Hope she is ok. Meanwhile Wells Fargo stole from 3,5 million people.
At least the cop got fired.
that was career ending he has since been fired
&quot;You&#39;re making a huge mistake&quot;<br><br>Tried to warn him!   Aaaaand now he&#39;s fired.  Hope she gets a pile of money next.
Its at times like this were im glad that im british.

Obviously the cop was under substance
Lol.. she is the one has told me no... u stupid fuck cop
I really really hope he gets sacked and that poor nurse who did actually follow procedure to the tea gets thousands of dollars compansation
Bad Elk v. United States
Dept. would be sued by truck driver unless they could show the driver had drugs in his system. They were counting on intimidating hospital staff to get the blood illegally and then being sued later on. The supervising officer actually admits that they do what they want then get sued later. Your not allowed to interfere whether they are breaking the law or not. The only recourse according to the supervisor is civil action.<br>Just one problem with that &quot;opinion&quot; this moron supervisor is running under:<br>Bad Elk v. United States
Utah officer fired after nurse&#39;s arrest caught on video  <a href="http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/utah-officer-fired-after-nurses-arrest-caught-on-video/ar-AAtgVA3?li=BBnb7Kz&amp;ocid=mailsignout">http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/utah-officer-fired-after-nurses-arrest-caught-on-video/ar-AAtgVA3?li=BBnb7Kz&amp;ocid=mailsignout</a>
He got fired! Thank God!
Cop was clearly an idiot! 1. Nurse is just representing the Hospital, but the director rules it. So, address yourself to the director. 2. If you put a healthcare worker, a woman, in custidy in such a harmless situation, where was the sentence: You are in custidy, turn back, give me your arm, I have to put handcuffs on you. (+saying your rights)? Why immediately braking her wrist? 3. How can you do your job, if you have so little legal knowladge? Don&#39;t you know when you have the right for blood simples? 4. BUT THE BIGGEST MISTAKE! Where is your common sense? Are you really such a big idiot, to arrest a fellow worker, who is really on your side, working together with you every day? Police officers, firefighters, nurses are on the same side, suffering from the same problems every day, fighting for our safer life every day! Clearly you lost your mind! The system is also responsible, because you think you are allowed to do that. Now, after 27 years, you pay a very expensive price! I hope other officers will learn from it,. You have a certain power in your hand, granted by us, citizens, to serv and to protect, not to be an idiot!
I&#39;ve just learned that the cop responsible for the nurse&#39;s arrest has been fired.  Karmic justice!
It&#39;s incidents like these that make me hard to trust police anymore. They keep doing stupid shit because they&#39;re entitled with their badge and gun and handcuffs. The &quot;officer&quot; deserved to be fired.
Fire with no pay sue sue sue
just heard that this police officer was fired. this pig of an officer obviously has no regard for the law, seeing as how the nurse was following protocol and only doing her job. just has been served.
William Gray the patient that Alex wobbles was protecting has passed away. <br>Gray was an innocent by stander who was severely burned when another man (Marcos Torres) fleeing the police ran his pickup into Grays semi-truck. Gray was doing nothing wrong when Torres ran into to him. <br>Gray was clinging and fighting for his life for something he had no fault in, and still these officers just because Gray was driving a commercial vehicle wanted their blood sample. <br>William Gray was not only a truck driver from Idaho, he was also a reserve officer for the Rigby Idaho police department. He was only 43 years old. &quot;Condolences&quot; and thank you Alex Wobbles.....
This is what happens when the people charged with enforcing the law don&#39;t know the law!
ur internal policies you dumb bitch don&#39;t exceed the authority of the police! hope ur ass was fired!
Like most arrogant police or petty bureauros... Drunk on their own Power !!!
Fuck the police.
That cop should die
WHITE LIVES MATTER!!! Wow these cops are being blatantly racist. This woman was just doing her job but because she is white they threw her onto a trashcan and arrested her. THIS HAS TO END PEOPLE!! I suggest that we, as a nation, begin kneeling at major sporting events when the National Anthem is playing.
The completely insane US police state ........................
WHAT A PIECE OF SHIT O M G ...... HE SOULD NOT EVEN WORK AS MALL COP !!!!!!!!! HE IS FUCKING RETARDED!!!!
FUCK THIS POLICE OFFICER !!!!! I HOPE HE BURNS IN HELL !!!!!!!!
American cops smh.
&quot;Land of the Free&quot;<br><b>Laughs in European</b>
Her patient died today.  He never did anything wrong. The police chase caused the car to go head on into him.  <a href="http://fox13now.com/2017/09/26/patient-utah-nurse-was-arrested-for-protecting-has-died/">http://fox13now.com/2017/09/26/patient-utah-nurse-was-arrested-for-protecting-has-died/</a>
Omg poor lady
No wonder cops are getting shot. People have had enough. It&#39;s time the government found out the true meaning of power and authority.
Everyone ought to send this nurse $1, it could be your rights she was willing to protect, and, we need medical staff to realize this is what we want, protection for our rights, when we are vulnerable and unable to fend for ourselves!!!!!
I understand that actually 2 officers were involved Payne and his supervisor they both should be fired and not even allowed to be night watchmen at a shopping mall the other by standing officers should be disciplined also just saying
This cop is a piece of shit. He obviously went against policy and procedure and acted emotionally.
Oh my God, this is so sad.
I am SO HAPPY this nurse was a white, blonde woman (probably mormon)...this could not have been a more cut and dry case of actionable police brutality.  Had she been anything other than who she was, they police would have immediately put out their misinformation of her being a drug-dealing prostitute on the side.  I hope both these officers get prosecuted to the fullest extent and lose their careers.
I want to slit this cops fucking throat.
She&#39;s going to get paid. I hope they fire his ass. That&#39;s how lawn Forssman get a bad name right there.
I have a different view here. Maybe the cop was wrong but I think in case of any emergency/scene, the police should be allowed to take whatever reasonable action they think fit and people can always sue them later if they were in the wrong.Imagine if information regarding an unconscious patient was needed to prevent a terrorist act. Should a nurse with her interpretation of law and terrorism be allowed to prevent saving hundreds of lives?
LMAO!!!!!! My skin color triggers the same reaction. &quot;America the Great&quot;
You guys are taking this too far. True, the cop overreacted. However, the nurse after hearing that she was under arrest, should have just turned around and let him make his arrest.
<b>**Nice Video***</b><br>Do you need a website .??????<br><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/soohag/create-professional-website-as-your-requirement#">https://www.fiverr.com/soohag/create-professional-website-as-your-requirement#</a>!
Her husband should handle that
I applaude Alex for doing her job!!!! I&#39;m an RN also and if a patient is unresponsive, her job is to advocate for said patient and protect him/her at all costs. Only thing she did wrong was resist the arrest. The hospital has attorneys and I would have gladly gone to jail to protect any of my patients rights. If she had complied and given the police the atients blood sample  she would have been at risk for losing her job.
This is a damn shame it seems that nurse knows the law but the officer does not. Surprise surprise.
LAWSUIT
Lucky I live in Australia where the cops aren&#39;t retarted.
I HOPE THAT GIRL SUES SO HUGE THOSE BASTARDS WILL HAVE TO GIVE  BLOW JOBS TO PAY FOR THE  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  MILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT&#39;S WOW  JUST PLAIN WOW IM SHOCKED !!
i can be your lawyer if you want to press charges against that officer
fire that officer
The man literally arrested that nurse for doing her job. This is absolutely disgraceful, and goes against every noble idea that ever informed the creation of policing, and the concepts of law and justice to boot. Absolutely disgusting!!!
Scary.
fucking pigs
Fuck this police officer ! Looser
Perfect example of a cop who thinks he is the law and doesn&#39;t understand that he&#39;s there to enforce the law defined by others - this seems to be a real issue in some counties, particularly the US.
That&#39;s one more reason I&#39;ll never visit America.
So the armed criminal has been rewarded with paid vacation until the media loses interest in the story.
Wow bro id fight that one
If looking at the broad spectrum, USA is declining in many crucial aspects as a sovereign nation, and many issues are becoming worse.<br><br>To name a few: economics (constant printing of money and currency devaluation of the dollar, government spending and growing national debt ($20 trillion as of September 11th 2017)), law enforcement (unlawful arrests, police brutality and shootings), politics (only 2 major parties, corporate-favored candidates heavily backed by wealth), social disparity (indifference, conflicts and crimes among people of opposing political ideologies and races), healthcare (costly hospital, pharmaceutical and insurance fees), foreign policies (USA has nearly 800 military bases around the world in more than 70 countries, and has in total been at war 222 out of 239 years since 1776).
&quot;Lawyer&quot;
Nurses will always be more respected than cops. I think that nurse knows a little more of what she&#39;s talking about than that arrogant cop.
another peaceful day in USA
if the law TRULY were followed, this cop would have been in jail THAT VERY DAY
Cop&#39;s caused the crash and are trying to take his blood. ..illegally
we need to break the policemans arms and legs, maybe his neck and spine too
The only one getting arrested here is the one filming with a 240p camera
Wubbles brought this onto herself. All she had to do was let him make the draw.  She yelled like a goddamn fool.
WHEN ANY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE VIOLATES THEIR OATH....they are GUILTY OF TREASON,and all their supporters are GUILTY OF TREASON,theres a war coming over this,GET READY ..your going to have to FIGHT THIS FILTH ,remember their ALL bloodthristy killers...Who worship SATAN...the hero&#39;s of america,ARE SATANS WOLFPACK......
I&#39;m livid that a shift Lt allowed his subordinate officer to be a cowered and arrest a nurse! If this indecent public servant wanted to be real he would have arrested the hospital administrator...  I&#39;m so sorry Wubbles that you had to endure this. For the LT. can&#39;t wait until justice rains on you and you earn your dismissal and loose your retirement. Detective you know better than to carry out an order that should have never been issued. I&#39;ll bet even though you hide behind the LTs horrible choices that you will be retired within months of the investigation.
Fucking pigs
How in the WORLD did the entire Hospital staff not go after this guy, especially the Dr&#39;s. ???
This is why people hate the police.
The hospital and staff did everything they could to avoid this. The SLCPD agreed to the things the hospital needed for blood. The head of the burn ward told the officer he was making a huge mistake.  The law is very clear you can not threaten hospital staff, or detain them, you put the lives of everyone that they are carrying for at risk.  This was completely senseless. However the officer chose to ignore all this because he was a hot head, he is the law,  what he says goes, is what was going on in his mind. Cops really need to be trained that everyone has rights not just cops. Officers can not just do what they want.
I would of gave that cop a REAL excuse to arrest me and since it was at a hospital he wouldnt need an ambulance after i was done knuckle drilling his forehead! :)
I would like to have my time alone with this fuck!
fucking pig
Shame on the cop who should not only go to gaol (jail), lose his job and benefits. He too should eat some good ol &#39;humble pie&#39; and do some community service to the hospital.. <br>Well done for the nurse standing her ground.
she had a grenade
The cop is clearly a racist, sexist, homophobe, xenophobe, <i>____________</i> - phobe.
My dad is a nurse and she did not do anything
jesus fucking christ. <b>this cop better get fired. anybody know who he is or what&#39;s happened to him?!?!?!</b>
If she was a member of my family I would find that PIG at a later date and fuck him over with my fists.
whoa he made a big MF <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mistake">#mistake</a>
were done.. looks like the cop may be done here.. enjoy looking for another job
Wow so he gets mad because the guy on the phone doesn&#39;t agree with him, so he arrests her?? Seriously? <br><br>And also what a fail. lol After the guy on the phone asks him, &quot;Why are you getting mad at the messenger&quot;, he responds, &quot;She&#39;s the one who told me no.&quot; Lol Where is this guy&#39;s head at?
Detective Jeff Payne will never live this down there will be a reminder always until his last days.
death on those filthy cops , death on them abd quick
Cop should be fired (I believe he was). He should also be charged for assault and battery at the very minimum, fined and jailed. Sorry, but he was acting illegally. Pretty sure the point of law is to protect people and to apply evenly to all. Rule by gangs I mean police seems to be rather out of hand these days.
This is the face of fascism!!!
The cop should be FIRED!!! He violated the person of someone who was mediating a situation and he had NO right to handle her so roughly. Shame on SLCPD! Shame on the officer!!! You give your brothers in blue a bad name! Your police department AGREED to those terms. Who the hell are you to violate them and abuse that woman? Feel like a big man do you? I stand for cops at all times but you are a disgrace.
Why the hell this cop becomes all the sudden so out of control, and start yelling like a psychopath, like she were a criminal,<br>What the hell he think he is? She was following hospital&#39;s protocol, like any business had some conducts.<br>If the cop did not agree with this protocol, even after she red it to him, then he should had to her boss.<br>This arrogant prepotent cop did not care if the city is going to be sue, the residents will pay for the sue.<br>Why Police department does not enforce more strict rules who fuck up? <br>Because they themselves act like a  brotherhood mafia.
Now that was a minute and a half of career suicide for him to cringe about in a few years. The nurse also looked good, for showing us when it is appropriate to oppose the police - when they try to yield authoritarian power and not follow their own rules.
i would have hit her with a tazzer till she SHIT herself
This cop is stuped
that cop should be fired,,,,........... he made his own law,,
To the nurse: THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, MA&#39;AM. WE NEED MORE LIKE YOU. <br>To the cop: YOU ARE THE REASON PEOPLE HATE THE POLICE AND YOU ARE PUTTING YOUR FELLOW OFFICERS IN DANGER.
No wonder cops in US get shot. damn MOFOs...
Our so-called democracy is now a police state.  It seems that nobody&#39;s rights matter when dealing with the police.
fucking pigs
I don&#39;t see why a police officer would need a warrant in that situation. The evidence would be escaping so ....
Umm why did she get arrested did I miss something
Welcome to the real world mam. A world where you allow this type of behaviour on others but never expected it to be used on you.
WHAT A GREAT COUNTRY!!!!!
by now if you want to shock or surprise us, inform about stories where cops DIDNT behave worse than half the people they arrest
I think both cops should be fired. Payne and the cop that was talking to her at the car. They where wrong.  And they wonder way people don&#39;t trust cops. I hope she sues the shit out of them.
America: Land of the Free<br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Did they still get the blood drawn we need to know?!?!?!
So she was assaulted and arrested by a cop for doing her job!<br>Fuck kill me now, seriously what the fuck is wrong with our world
This officer gets paid administrative leave for breaking the law?

f****************ck that cop he should go die in a hole
Proof that they hate us all!
She&#39;s married to the cop.  That&#39;s just their little foreplay routine.
Why is the cops face never shown?
Fuk da police
This cop is just an A hole. Gives good cops bad names. I hope she sued the crap out of the department and they didn&#39;t give him this bs of paid leave.
OMG God, the cops are a greater threat to Americans than Kim in Korea!!
I really want a piece of Jeff Paine. I hope to meet him one day. He&#39;ll never forget it.
Fucking scumbag pieces of shit!
The reaction and attitude of the cop reminded me of my Mormon school teachers who never followed the rules and laws.  They were all about authority, and job titles.  They had issues with women teachers, and administrators.   In their culture women don&#39;t tell men what to do.
that was beyond revolting. It&#39;s this shit that gets cops shot. I have a pretty strong stomach for this kind of thing but this one made my blood boil. Plain and simple abuse of power.
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the first time the cop violated anyone&#39;s rights
This disgusts me. I hope she sues his ass and he gets jailed.
Listen, we black folks have been saying this for decades. DECADES. It&#39;s not even a race thing. The cops is out of control. They have been for a long while. They usually overpolice minority neighbourhoods, so we see their behavior more often. But with cameras now, we will also see how they treat ALL people, including whites.<br><br>They are out of control. Look to Scandinavia and their model. The police deescalates. It&#39;s an entirely different world.

Idiot guards, why the fuck take blood from a unconchas patient, and FUCKING ARREST HER?! Fuck you guards go to hell basterds.
That cop is out of control and not fit for purpose. If he behaves this way to an emergency service worker how the hell is he going to react to a civilian. Should be fired, sued and prosecuted for assault.
Dude on the phone sounded like a SJW and triggered the cop.  Good job fuckwit
Damnit!!  I hate seeing this kinda stuff.  Gives all cops a bad name.
Hello!<br>Someone arrests this cop. You need to get psychological exams. It&#39;s all wrong. Things should never be like this.
I highly recommend all police officers apologize to their medical contacts for this deliberate assault by one of their own.<br>One idiot created a huge chasm between the two professions.<br>Silence on the part of police widens that rift.
The dude was 100% wrong and looks completely unstable.  That being said, her reaction was ridiculous, she was being placed in handcuffs, not being burned alive.
This is sad. The police force here in Utah bending the law to their liking again. If you ignore a police man be ready for him to slam some sort of ticket in your face. Its disgraceful to the police force and for men. A grown man (with a gun unfortunately) acts childish and arrests a woman when he doesn&#39;t get what he wants. ARE YOU KIDDING? Why does the policeman think she needs to do what he asks in the first place?? SHE DOESN&#39;T WORK FOR YOU! AND WHY ARREST HER AFTER!? SERIOUSLY? If I worked at a clock store, and I refuse to tell you what time it is because your not a paying customer, your first reaction is to arrest me? I hope you enjoy your retirement buddy you have a lot to think about.
Sue the fuck out of that police dept.
Why do other police allow there team members to go through with this. I get the need for brotherhood in stressful situations, but allowing your partner, co worker, friend, family member or any other person assault an innocent female doing her job is going against the very vows you undertook and swore to uphold. Officers caught like this need 12 months desk only duty and to pass an anger manager course. <br>If civilians screw up this bad they would be fired or seriously reprimanded.<br>For those who say sue, good for the Vitim but it does nothing to curb this officer from repeating this behavior again and again. <br>Police have gotten a bad enough rap already, Police themselves need to start weeding out the rotten eggs from the force from within and regain the trust and admiration of the people for the mostly difficult and un-thankful job you do.
fat and bellowing nurse.. how annoying. glad her ass got taken down. resisting arrest.
Is the cop wrong in this situation?<br>Of course, 100%<br><br>But she didn&#39;t have to scream like an annoying bitch
Blue lives Matter !!...<br>Just do what the police say geez...<br>Its that easy!...<br>Stop resisting and nothing will happen!<br>Comply comply comply!
white lives matter<br><br><br><br><br><br>no... just no  -_-
fuck the police, the little bitch boy cop abusing his power.... he doesn&#39;t get his way, which made him mad so he arrests a person who committed no crime, I wonder what bullshit crime he charged her with.
Just remember, &quot;I&#39;m from the government and I&#39;m here to help you&quot;
Come on ya all, he was just following trumps orders to police to not be nice.  Get use to it trumpites, this is what is going to be the norm for the next few years as the dictator spews out his tweets and meanness.
Grey&#39;s Anatomy season 14
The rogue cop was surrounded by men yet none of them came to the aid of the nurse. The cop was committing an assault and the men who were all around this poor piece of excrement posing as a cop should have jumped him and put him down like the feral animal he proved to be. We are now a nation of girly men. Pathetic.
When cops dont know the laws
Hand over the blood and nobody gets hurt!
Can some1 summarise what she did wrong for me?
i think the nurse pulled out some kid of vodo knife and poked it into the police mans&#39;s butt and thats why she was arrested
Things like this are embarrassing my home town. A cop arresting a nurse doing her job? Really?!! Make sure he gets the roughest cell on the block please.
Where were security to restrain this guy? What&#39;s the point in having beefy security guards if they don&#39;t use their beef? If that guy came into the hospital I used to work in as security I&#39;d have had him a choke hold and down to casualty asap quicker than you could say abuse of power. That nurse&#39;s explanation seems perfectly rational and reasonable to me. Is the US the world&#39;s paradigm democracy, or is it tilting towards the totalitarianism of Nazi Germany? This guy needs to be apprised of the fact that civil liberties trumps powers of arrest any time. Or be sent on an employee assistance program (EAP) for work related stress and/or anger management. Wise up guys. You&#39;re not John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, of Jean Claude Van Damme. Get in touch with your feminine side and hug some trees, why don&#39;t ya!
America in a nutshell... joke of a country
Fire all those fucking cops.
Wtf, I bet that guy would arrest someone at McDonalds for putting ice in his drink
This cop needs to be in a psych ward to get some help.  He is REALLY going to hurt somebody in the near future.  He just went off the deep end without provocation.  Terrifying.
Here&#39;s a little more information about the incident described above, which occurred on July 26.<br><br>Police chased a vehicle that had been reported for reckless driving, pursuing at high speed until the driver crossed the median and collided with the semi-truck that William Gray, a reserve police officer from Rigby, Idaho, was driving. The suspect was killed in the collision, and Gray was put into a medical coma following the crash due to his severe burns, and airlifted via helicopter to the burn center in Salt Lake City.<br><br>Salt Lake City police were not involved in the chase, but arrived at the hospital to draw blood from Gray, who was still unconscious, despite laws declaring this illegal. The police tried to use &quot;implied consent&quot;, a concept illegal in Utah since 2017. Gray&#39;s blood had previously been drawn by the hospital, and even if Wubbels did draw blood, it was likely contaminated due to the opioids and drugs keeping Mr. Gray alive and sedated. He was also at serious risk of infection. In any case, drawing blood from an unconscious and unwilling patient is illegal.<br><br>Immediately after the incident, the University of Utah hospital changed its policy, barring police officers from entering patient care areas, requiring them to check in at the front desk and have hospital escorts.<br><br>Officer Payne is currently on administrative leave, but was not taken off active duty until this video from his body camera was released to the public; it was being used in legal proceedings between Mrs. Wubbels and the police, and the proceedings weren&#39;t making headway.<br><br>Major reaction outside of the hospital was not taken until the video went public. Now the Salt Lake City police department and Mayor of Salt Lake City have denounced officer Payne.<br><br>William Gray is still recovering from his injuries. He has a GoFundMe to support his wife visiting him and helping his recovery: <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/BillGray">https://www.gofundme.com/BillGray</a>
Disgusting behavior and totally over the top. Nothing but bullys with egos. And they wonder why most people don&#39;t like or trust them.
us in a nutshell
......blue lives matter?
Every person who was in the area when that happened should have jumped that pig that gave him a beat down.  What a piece of shit, she told him the law and he lost it, she embarrassed him because he did not know his job and he was having none of it.  I have seen smoother arrests of drunken/high people who are fighting back.  And this guy has decades of experience, even his boss did not know the law!  Americans must just let anyone be cops?  Like the guy setting up his tripod to take a pic of a cop doing an arrest in a VERY SMALL community where everyone knows everyone was the quote, and the cop shot the only journalist in the community...He did not recognize him in this tiny community where they all know each other?  LMAO.  He thought his camera/tripod was a gun and said nothing, just shot him...WTF...You Americans have some fucked up cops, time to revolt and maybe have another civil war!
It needs to be mandatory to have a drug screening done whenever there is an officer involved shooting. Because, Logan Police Capt. Curtis Hooley said it is customary for police officers to seek a blood sample from each driver involved in a fatal crash in order to “cover their bases.”  I demand the same thing just to cover my bases.
Yo wtf
UPDATE   U.S.<br>Utah cop who arrested nurse over blood draw fired from second job at Gold Cross Ambulance.
Every officer that was there needs to have their retirement plan forfeited to the nurse because they&#39;re not fit to be a police officer.
the bystanders including the other cops, should have stepped up and done something.
3000 cops disliked this video
ABSOLUTE DONKEY OF THE DAY. Take an L you scumbag
I am normally totally against scumbag lawyers and people who are out to sue everyone for every stupid thing they can think of....but this lady needs to sue this idiot and make sure he is fired...Not the police department or the hospital but this cop individually.
Above the Law....
She was so professional and explained to him thoroughly what was required. And she even pointed out that those were conditions that the hospital and the PD had agreed to beforehand, so it wasn&#39;t like it was some new, harsh policy imposed by the hospital. The cop needs to be sued and fired. No excuse for this bullshit.
Gotta ad that I have several cop buddies... I shoot straight with them and I know that  they know I know...
I&#39;m an old white guy and proud Republican (Trump Supporting American). I got over racism (until Barack Hussein insisted on bringing it back). I also happen to be a Nurse. I used to be a big &quot;Back The Blue&quot; supporter; but I&#39;m convinced that the vast majority of our law enforcement community are uneducated, egotistical, bullies. They make less than a Nurse. The proof of overwhelming civil disobedience a bully public disgrace is undeniable
HIPAA
I can&#39;t stand police, they think their big and bad and above the law.<br>they had a chance to help me out one night instead they ridiculed and threatened me for no reason.  didn&#39;t even offer to help.  to protect and serve A.  yeah right!
This gives me an idea for a children&#39;s book.  <br><br>&quot;Wubbles the Troubled Nurse&quot;<br><br>There once was a nurse named Wubbles, whose inability to listen caused her some troubles. Though the orders were wrong she refused to go along and off with the cops she&#39;ll go. <br><br>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. 😂
&quot;Help help, aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh, baaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwww, ASSULT bwaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.&quot;<br><br><br>LOL what a bitch
I&#39;m willing to bet that cop beats his wife or girlfriend.
heroes
Fucking pigs. Earning the hate
Fire that cop
Of course all the &quot;there&#39;s two sides here&quot; people take off when more and more video has come out showing that what we all think happened here, is exactly what happened here.
Only in America...
The only thing to learn from this is that Police officers are very dumb, dumb, dumb people stroking their id and you need to approach them as such.
Fuck the police
America only cares when it&#39;s a white middle class women being bullied.
It is highly illegal for that cop to have arrested that nurse. She was just following the hospital&#39;s policy, that cop had no right to do what he did.
thats why we carry concealed weapons. To deal with those in authority who are drunk with power. --
I think a question that needs to be asked by the media is, &quot;Has the police department obtained a sample of Mr. Grays blood that the hospital isn&#39;t aware of?&quot;.  I&#39;ve lived in hospitals.  I know how they work and how the people that work in the hospital, work.  Payne is a paramedic that makes runs to that hospital.  I know he could still be able to &quot;weasel&quot; that blood sample out through another tech.  Cops do not like to take no for an answer, just like they don&#39;t ever want to admit they were wrong.  They may have done it, not anticipating just how much backlash this was going to ignite.
What  a dumbass cop.  Doesn&#39;t even know the laws and policies.
This cop should be in jail immediately!!! God bless Alex Wubbels!!
So explain this to me like I&#39;m a 6 year old....why didn&#39;t the officer just place the patient under arrest? That would have solved it...obviously he had the video of the crash and they pulled the driver from the truck....this officer needs to be fired and I hope Ms. Wubbels sues SLC police.  Due process MUST be followed.
Guys, <b>CLEARLY</b> the nurse was reaching for his gun.
Why wasn&#39;t this patient under arrest if blood was needed to be drawn...that is puzzle, puzzle, puzzle to me.  This copper is a detective?  hmm...
this is yet another example of cops running amuck!!!!!!!!!!!<br>there doing what there good at,,beating people,,shooting and killing people,,and threatening people!!!!!!!!!!!!!   the moral of the story?   NEVER TRUST A COP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I got chills listening to that.  Hearing a woman scream in fear, &quot;Stop!  Somebody help me!&quot; is just one of the most heart-wrenching thing in this world.
THIS. This is why bodycams are amazing. They protect citizens from corrupt cops, and they protect cops from crazy citizens.
Living in Trumps America
Cop&#39;s name is Jeff Payne, I hope his community and the internet punish him because I doubt his police department will.  That was brutal and unnecessary.  I cannot imagine what he has done with the power of his position throughout his career.
This is assault and False Arrest, and both actions are against the law. Worse still, both actions were taken by this officer in an attempt to break another law protecting a patient&#39;s rights, and the patient wasn&#39;t even in custody, merely a suspect. This is no different than if a cop waltzed in to a random hospital, randomly picked a patient and demanded blood and physically assaulted anyone who refused.
Please...where is all the outrage when cops kill innocent Black people? Fuck this nurse...the police didn&#39;t kill her because she would have been stretched out in a casket if she were a Black nurse. I just can&#39;t find any sympathy for Whites at all in any situation.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23weonlykillblackpeople">#WeOnlyKillBlackPeople</a>
not only did the cop abuse his power, he failed to read the nurse her rights. He should be arrested for assault, false arrest, see how he likes it, then have his job terminated. Sadly if she was African American she may not have been so lucky
Read the article from Townhall daily, and the interesting part is the statement that the &#39;Policy has been updated. SO... does that mean they changed the policy to CYA , or is the future policy going to include arresting anyone who sites the current law. This is the future , of the global mindset. the law is a suggestion at the cops descretion. This is a slippery slope.
Cops can shoot and kill unarmed blacks and get away with it but soon as someone white get treated unfair by the cops white America gets upset?
if it is for dui consent was given when the license was signed!!
This makes me angry.
Heather Thompson may I ask what kind of trouble? I had some trouble near Beaver myself, back in 2002. It was shortly after 9/11, I wasn&#39;t going to risk my life on an airplane, so I drove across from Vegas to get home to Denver. I was driving my Corvette convertible which I owned free and clear. Cars were passing me left and right because I don&#39;t speed, I&#39;m a slowpoke driver and I always have been. Maybe because I&#39;m nearsighted and I&#39;m scared of hitting a deer or a squirrel. Anyway, the Utah troopers pulled me over and ordered me out of my vehicle. They made me sit on the curb while they searched my car. I hadn&#39;t done anything wrong, and it was embarrassing as they dug through my things and held them up and inspected them. i guess they had never seen matching lace bras and panties from Victorias Secret, because they spent an inordinate amount of time passing them around and holding them up. <br><br>&quot;Ma&#39;am, our computer says your vehicle is stolen.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s impossible! I own it free and clear, see, here&#39;s my folder of repair receipts, here&#39;s the insurance, photos of me with the car, here&#39;s the title in my name. I bought this car from an Arapahoe County Sheriffs Deputy, you can call him and he&#39;ll tell you. Your computer is wrong.&quot;<br><br>They put me in handcuffs and in jail. They weren&#39;t going to let me be bonded out except that my friend&#39;s sister&#39;s friend called her brother, a lawyer in Colorado. He told it to them straight: &quot;What are her charges? You&#39;re not charging her with anything? You&#39;d better release her immediately, she hasn&#39;t done a crime and you can&#39;t keep her in jail.&quot; The bail bond lady kindly drove me to the greyhound bus station so I could get home to Denver. Itr took me all summer to get my Corvette back. $500 in impound fees, $1,500 to the one lawyer in Cedar City who would take my case. The other seven were scared of the judge, Margaret Miller because she was descended from a Mormon prophet or something.<br><br>To this day, I have an NCIC number. &quot;Interstate Offender Drugs Guns&quot; is extra ridiculous because I don&#39;t use drugs, and I don&#39;t have any guns. Campbell King, I won&#39;t drive across Utah ever again either. It&#39;s another country out there and they make their own rules.
Let me get this straight <br>Patient didn&#39;t have a warnet for giving blood <br>The nurse is talking to the police about it <br>She gets arrested for no reason
Another example of our domestic gestapo force abusing their power.
Handcuffs and all? wow America is a shithole.
The nurse should be given that cops pension.  And he should be fired and given 6 months in jail.
What an American move
Look at all the manly men letting baldy bully the blonde, unabated.<br><br>She specifically asked for help.
Someone better fucking do something about this police officer before I fly over there and do something myself...if you catch my drift
the lawyer even said you are making a huge mistake right now.

I was outraged in watching this video. What kind of detective/commissar does the city have under its charge? I was also outraged that the University police sat around idle-mindedly as they allowed this to happen.  This poor nurse was falsely arrested, not allowed to participate in her life-saving duties,  as well as having her constitutional rights violated.  The detective behaved with reckless abandon. I hope they boot this sorry ass detective off the force, and the city had better dig deeply on offering this poorly a settlement as well as make a public apology.
Was it that bad to be honoust
Police need to know the law, otherwise just out of control.
I hope this cop is getting fired, this makes me sick
Our tax money should not be paying for his vacation.  Its an open and shut case. He needs to be terminated  like any employee..And all others envolved  No pension, no unemployment.
You cannot trust the government at all. All they want is power, our money, they lie to us left and right. They abuse their power 24/7. Live off the grid and you&#39;ll fur sure receive punishment! Why? Bcs you have to pay to live even if you have the resources to live off the grid. You can&#39;t even collect excessive amounts of rain water in some places. Vitamin B17 is illegal here in the U.S. bcs they&#39;ll loose billions of dollars if people cured their own cancer. We&#39;re basically puppets. These police officers probably don&#39;t even know all of their laws. It&#39;s easy to become a regular police officer. Just take a damn written test, the physical agility exam and so forth. Even I passed those exams but found that the career wasn&#39;t for me. We&#39;ll keep being abused by the system unless we wake up and we all go against this unfair system.
Dumb idiots hired by local PDs, do they even have GEDs
thank god I wasn&#39;t there, the low IQ PSYCHO cop would have been taken down with a baseball bat, low life scum of the earth.
What kind of an arrest is that. The cop seemed to fly off the handle.
Blue lives people!
What&#39;s even crazier is the pig was demanding this blood test be done to the victim who was unconscious with severe burns all over his body. THE SUSPECT THEY WHERE CHASING JUMPED INTO THE OPPOSITE  LANE AND HIT THE DRIVER OF A SEMI TRUCK HEAD ON TO KILL HIMSELF. THE PIGS ARE SO WORKED UP AND STUPID THEY WANT TO BLAME ANYONE THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL MAN THEY WANTED TO LOCK UP IS DEAD AND SOMEONE WHO IS ALIVE MUST PAY. Pig logic is absolutely Insane
THE VIDEO AND AUDIO EVIDENCE IS CLEAR! FIRE HIM! PERIOD! <br>Then, BRING HIM UP ON CHARGES! <br>SOMEONE WITH THAT TEMPERAMENT HAS NO BUSINESS BEING A COP.
wow, fuck the police
All those cops around the cop arresting her are fucking cowards, I don&#39;t care if I go to jail or not if that&#39;s my partner i would have him on his fucking ass.
Did he drop his toupee while arresting her!!!
Sueing is called for violating her rights. Love our nurses, God&#39;s angles.
I am a ER nurse that has transitioned to Community Nursing. Most areas for nursing are potentially hazardous BUT This event in particularly bought tears to my eyes. As care givers we witness so much that we have to heal from. Alex, I wish you a complete recovery from this unexpected, unnecessary abuse.
WTF ARE WRONG WITH THE COPS?!
Protect and serve, everybody.
FUCKING BULLY!!!
This Cop is is done!  His BOSS is DONE!  The Hospital &quot;Security&quot; Team, DONE!  Man She can sue the crap out of all these losers and she will win.  Pain, anguish, mental fatigue.  I mean this can just go on and on and on....
He&#39;s a bully! He should lose his job, he think he&#39;s above the law.
I hate America so fucking much. The most useless country on planet Earth, you put the most disgusting losers in control of people and give them all the power and wonder why your country is in the state it&#39;s in. Take the whole area and lower it into the ocean, so tired of hearing about all the shit that goes on there not even every day but every hour of every day. AMERICA IS SHITE.
He&#39;s obviously to old and senile to continue in law enforcement and can no longer function in a professional manner to SERVE AND PROTECT or he never has and has got away with it for many years either way this video should be all that is needed to relieve him of further harm to other innocents.
I have seen the whole video. The cop is definitely to blame. She forgave the police department and city. But what gets me is the chief of police did not apologized until the video went viral and he basically had to. Typical. Arrested a person for doing her job and he got personal and violent with no nead. Very poorly trained veteran cop. And the rentacops imployed by the campus were worse.
Roughly 60% of cops have been bullied growing up so there&#39;s really nothing to see here but the bullied becoming the bully
Detective Jeff Payne should be fired
Detective better get his resume up to date.
Now imagine this guy stopping you on a Saturday night with no cameras around.
All I ask life is that in such situation, I don&#39;t scream. I don&#39;t want to give them the satisfaction.
When I first heard the story, I thought everyone makes mistakes and this guy deserves a second chance. After seeing this video, the officer was COMPLETELY out of line and deserves disciplinary action.
this is bullshit no one shoould have that right to do this to someone
Yea man , this cop needs to go away. This is absolutely unacceptable.
She was literally sticking to the law🙄
Bluelivesmatter bluelivesmatter yay
This happens to innocent black people everyday but when it happens to a white woman then you want to get rid of police or have police reform mighty funny
&quot;She told me no.&quot;<br>Well, when that cop&#39;s wife tells him no, does he abruptly turn all violent too? The guy has clear anger management issues if thats how he reacts to people telling him no. He&#39;s like a spoilt toddler that dislikes being told no...... He throws a hissy fit.
I hope that &quot;cop&quot; got his ass sued. I hope he realizes he can&#39;t push people around like that and abuse power like that. I hope she got an apology for doing nothing wrong.<br>I hope they sacked the idiot cop and he&#39;s never allowed to work in law enforcement ever again because he does not deserve to. He deserves to work at Burger King the rest of his life.
another stupid power tripping pig who doesn&#39;t like to be wrong so his answer for everything is to abuse his power. sue this fuck and get him off the streets!
He nee sum milk
These police officers are fucking heroes! Only absolute scum tries to cause a scene to avoid being arrested and only a complete piece of shit would try to stop our honourable men in blue from doing their jobs. God Bless America and rot in jail you bitch
uk police would never act like this, you should be ashamed of your police, disgusting!
<b>Excessive</b> <b>force.</b> Dismissed without pension, I hope. 
All cops are good according to Blue Lives Matter, sad and pathetic what happened here.
It terrifies me that a man like that was ever given power. Healthcare professionals are often at a much higher risk of abuse from <b>patients</b> than some other occupations, but they call the police to help them right? <b>Police</b> should not be the ones abusing. Disgusting.
dumb ass cops are too quick to pull this kinda shit, hope all the pigs here lost their jobs
omg they arrested her  i cant believe that
That&#39;s not what real police do. He should be ashamed of himself!!!
Anyone know if this guy got fired!? <br><br>If not that is some bull dust
oh snaaap..... he is faaarrrrrrkkkkkkkd
can&#39;t wait to become a paramedic and impose my authority over shitheads cops when required, and if they arrest me better for me I&#39;ll sue them. <br> plus they cannot kill me I&#39;m white
its because shes white this man should be fired
plz my name a jeeff
Cop should be sued. Wouldn&#39;t she have had patients to attend to?
Could someone please explain why what going on because I couldn&#39;t hear it well
It&#39;s like American cops are all bad people
Why did they even want the blood? The patient was the victim of the crash, is the cop moonlighting as an insurance agent?
This pisses me off so much!
There should be cops that attest dipshit cops.
Alex is bouta make bank from a big ass law suit
this cop should be sued he ausslted her and most likely gave her brusies
I bet the patient was black huh😑
Disgusted by his actions.
We&#39;re the government, and we&#39;re here to help (ourselves)
Since the cop was in the wrong I hope she sues the shit out of him
FTP
Nurses save people<br>Police save people<br><br>Why the fuck is this police brutally arresting this calm nurse
I have never been so thrilled to think, &quot;this hero is going to be *PAID*!&quot; She protected the rights of her patient. She protected the rights of an AMERICAN. She didn&#39;t back-down to the threats of a figure who assumes, because of his badge, is always right. This nurse is a hero. She is a defender of our civil liberties. All conservative and liberal Americans should rally around this defender of our Right&#39;s! I&#39;m proud such a brave women exists. If there is any way I can financially support her or her legal effort please direct me and everyone else!
Holy shit. Fuck that police officer. He needs to lose his job.
Mandatory emotional intelligence training and reduce stupidity like this by 20% easy
The cops didn&#39;t know in the moment whether she was dangerous or not and clearly she wasn&#39;t being compliant. Really, there&#39;s two sides to every story.
Abuse of Power. This cop needs to be sacked. Americans speak of freedom , when they cant practice freedom. Looks like the cop is a lonely man and a psycho. I hope he gets killed on the road.  Can Salt lake put this guy on traffic duty., so that he gets run over by a truck .<br>Hey Asshole COP. remember you are mother fucker and servant to the tax payers.  Policing is a privellege. Not your fucking right. Arent you the ones who call residents asking for donations offer the phone for police association. where will this money come from ?<br>What else to say., the filth (Europeans) of the world has shown how filty these people are.  I pray that some truck run over you while you are driving on the highway. or some ute run over you in a wallmart parking lot.
When your opponent is the authorities, GGWP
Stupid cop.
wow american polices are fat and noob.
Thats one way to get blood
Terminal madness of the end times. Horrible dystopian insanity with cops so invulnerable to all restrictions they would arrest a nurse asking them for a warrant to draw blood from an unconscious patient. LEOs need to be treated the same way people treat rabid dogs walking down the middle of a public street foaming at the mouth. That&#39;s what the 2nd amendment was for. That cop is a sick, diseased animal who cannot be treated by veterinarial science so he needs the veterinarial solution.
At least she&#39;s still alive. God bless!
As soon as she backed away, she was resisting  <br>Why didn&#39;t he shoot her?
Stupid cop, drama nurse, who is soon to be retired and rich.
This shit makes me wanna go vegan smh 😤
Fire all of the officers, at the very least.
what was he like towards people who might have done something wrong like jaywalking or littering?
The cop innocent because hostipital bill are crazy
Welcome to Trumps America.
Breaching an innocent citizens rights is the most disgusting thing any kind of law officer could do.
oink oink
lmao all these white people mad in the comments because she got arrested .... the same people who back up cops for killing black ppl when their cars break down
fire his ass    then sue .....a lawsuit will end up paid by taxpayers if hes still a cop
At least she wasn&#39;t shot
this cop deserves to get his head cut off.
typical american cop. you give them a badge and a gun and all of a sudden they go in a hospital and arrest a nurse for nothing. fk america and its justice system. so fked up.
she better sue him into eternal brokenness!
cops break the law they get a pass??
So when it happens to white people that&#39;s when everyone gets outraged huh hahaha
She should&#39;ve just drawn the blood and complied. The officer is always right.
Sir I&#39;m just doing my job..<br><br>What job? <b>cops injure her and arrest her</b>
Wow
Imagine how many of these situations occur without a video phone present.
The comment section is fucking stupid. You know why, because y&#39;all think the cops are there to help. He&#39;s there for Bruit force. I just joined the comment section. .  . I&#39;m fucking stupid. God dammit
This cop needs to be put behind bars. The nurse was just doing her job. He had no right to put her in cuffs.
It&#39;s awful that the nurse knew the law better than the law enforcement
dude put his hands on her like she had a gun. that kind of urgency was unsettling. clearly he had some pent-up anger, and he unleashed it on this poor woman.<br>how the fuck do guys like this get in the force. these are the kinds of motherfuckers that lie on their psych screenings.<br>America&#39;s police-brutality problems are so embarrassing. This country is going mad. God help us all
Police state USA
I like how all the fucking other cops just let him do it. WTF SAY SOMETHING. DO SOMETHING. APPARENTLY NONE OF THEM THOUGHT WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS WRONG.
Guess what she wasn&#39;t BLACK guess no million man March in contest because of this unjustified arrest of a professional women a nurse..............Now if she was black there would be routing looting.....my point here is this cop was wrong and not all cops are bad. But this guy takes the award....she the nurse told him the hospital policy had 3 requirements and not one was met plus the nurse had the admistrator on the phone.......lol this cop will be excop. Maybe he can get a job as a clown he has the hairline for it already......lol
That&#39;s bad
Arrested fired and sued... Talk about excessive use of force OMG. And he&#39;s probably going to try to say she resisted. He was pissed because she was making him look like an idiot.
Omg call 911
Seems routine to me every single day cops make arrest on some BS get over it just the way things are
Wow this is what&#39;s wrong with the world thanks!!!
Hope she sues the department!!
Hope people like that burn in hell
OMG I&#39;m so pissed off!!! &gt;:(     that cop must be sued ASAP.
What has this world come to
Those two guys at the end were also being very professional with the overreacting cop. They were trying to deescalate the situation and calm everyone down. Good on the too.
Let&#39;s see how many of these apply to this &quot;cop.&quot;<br>Utah Law<br>76-5-302.  Aggravated kidnapping. <br>(1) An actor commits aggravated kidnapping if the actor, in the course of committing unlawful detention or kidnapping:<br>(a) possesses, uses, or threatens to use a dangerous weapon as defined in Section 76-1-601; or<br>(b) acts with intent:<br>(i) to hold the victim for ransom or reward, or as a shield or hostage, or to compel a third person to engage in particular conduct or to forbear from engaging in particular conduct;<br>(ii) to facilitate the commission, attempted commission, or flight after commission or attempted commission of a felony;<br>(iii) to hinder or delay the discovery of or reporting of a felony;<br>(iv) to inflict bodily injury on or to terrorize the victim or another;<br><br>He was committing an unlawful detention.<br>(a) He possessed a dangerous weapon<br>(b) He acted with intent<br>(i) He was attempting to compel the hospital to break the law.<br>(iv) He intended to terrorize Miss Wubbles.<br><br>It&#39;s pretty clear from the statute this cop committed an aggravated kidnapping and the other cops at the very least failed to protect her civil rights, and at worst were accomplices.  This is a 15 year felony under Utah law and we must demand this officer be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  We wouldn&#39;t tolerate this from anyone else - it&#39;s far more intolerable from a Government official.  This cop must go to prison!
This policeman knew that he was filming the scene, that he was committing an illegal act, that he was terrorizing the nurses and that it would be broadcast on the internet. So what was his purpose?
She should have obeyed the police, video taped it and let the lawyers sort it out.
Nurse just took an L
Sometimes I respect the police for doing their jobs. Other times I&#39;m shocked at how they abuse power. It wasn&#39;t just on the cop arresting the nurse, but the other cops for allowing such abuse of power. There could&#39;ve been so many other alternates that would&#39;ve been acceptable, rather than arrest.
ASS holes!!!!!!
Why didn&#39;t the other cops stop him this is wrong
With those type of cops, we need a branch to protect the public from them.
Prideful cop!! Arrogant
Sue the police
Good on her! :)
so sorry this rougue Cop did the WRONG thing and acted like a bully and criminal himself,  he needs to be fired...and then sue his azz off Nurse Alex Wubbles!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is why cops don&#39;t deserve the same respect in society as a war hero/soldier.
I hope that cops get killed and rots in hell. Cops have no respect and think they&#39;re so powerful.
These Neo-Nazi fuckers need to hanged
This cop is on paid leave. Paid Leave!!! Are you kidding me?
We need Robocop!!! Let the girl go or there will be...trouble!!

Fuck the cops
I wonder how his wife feels when she&#39;s being beat every night for disagreeing with him.
HERE&#39;S THE BIGGER PICTURE:  WHY is this cop targeting the truck driver in the first place?  From what I&#39;ve gathered, a POLICE PURSUIT of a car is what CAUSED this truck to catch on fire and basically, put the driver in a burn unit...in a COMA.  IT&#39;S CALLED CYA...so obvious that there will be a MAJOR LAWSUIT from the truck driver (as should be) and his company against the City....MY QUESTION IS:  HOW MANY OTHER INNOCENT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THE TARGET OF THIS ROUGE COP??   Unbelievable.
I&#39;m waiting for the comments that defend the cop. Still waiting..
This is utterly disgusting
Cops are crazy. We should not trust them at all!
That is so unfair
Some dude in the comments said that his advisor told him to arrest anyone that got in the way of that blood sample
What did she do?
Burn in hell you lowlife cop, the truck driver was almost killed in that crash,<br>this what we have as police <br>fuck him
ACAB
That&#39;s fucking disgusting. Sued? He should be fired
Absolutely disgusting ... sue the cop for everything he has
Now you know how it feels to be treated like a nobody, this is what the general public goes through every day. If this was me I would be in jail. So what makes her any different. Because she was ......???? Not <del>obeying</del> the police.
If she was black this wouldn&#39;t have been trending 😑
Only in usa
Everybody is focused on the wrong issue here. A cop being a dick will be dealt with internally. Ye was talking about implyed consent. If more officers are doing this and not getting pulled up this could be a serious issue. Implied consent extends as far as medical attention. Not evidence collection (what this was about) and as he wasnt under arrest and there was no warrant (as the nurse said) but the cop seemed to think that the 5th amendment allowed him to do this. Cop medical training needs to be looked into far more. <br><br>For clarifacation this cop is trained to collect blood samples.
I&#39;m not sure why someone else on the staff (a doc or one of the nurses behind her) didn&#39;t back her up.
Holy Christ this can&#39;t be real what the hell happened?
Good one....
I dont care until i know the full story
Just saying as a personal note if that had been my wife my mother my sister anybody related to me to the point i care it would end very very bad
Hopefully this nasty bully boy will be sacked with loss of pension, jailed for assault, false arrest &amp; false imprisonment. While he&#39;s inside you should take his house and every last penny off him. He can come out of prison to sleep on a park bench, at least he looks the part!<br>I wonder how many times he&#39;s assaulted people &amp; violated their rights when there haven&#39;t been cameras around.
This Cop need to be fired immediately!!. If he can&#39;t follow the law.... Imagine all the laws he&#39;s braking when cámaras are not rolling !  😡😡
This cop needs to be thrown on snake island
Wow what a fucking loser. He needs his lips beating off.
Devils Advocate: Where is the rest of the video? I saw video on the news this morning where the Detective was talking further but no audio. This video stops as well. BTW she was let out of the unmarked police car after some 20 minutes. Remember folks an unconscious person consent is a LOT different than a patient awake and able to refuse. Doesn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t a dill weed about the whole thing but a department doesn&#39;t agree to deals with hospitals (the part she was reading), state law should bare that out. Most likely what she was reading was a hospital policy. Still waiting for this one to play out the the conclusion.
Did she get dragged
This cop arrested her illegally, and he needs to go to jail for breaking the law. No one is above the law not even a police.
imagine if she said &quot;THIS IS RAPE!!! RAPE!!!!!!!&quot;
The law (the police) is forcing a citizen (the nurse) to break a law! <br><br>It is illegal to draw blood from someone without their knowledge/permission.
no good pig
fucking pig, hope he gets shot
Fuckin pig should lose his job
THE GUY IN THE BACK GROUND IS ON THE PHONE TOO THE NURSE HAHAHAHAHAJAHA
When someone who is supossed to help ppl arrets a person who is actually helping ppl... Good think karma exists
She did the right thing . Detective needs to be fired and have civil charges brought against him for police brutality. What a way to treat those who take care of us. Shocking and disturbing. Brave woman.
That fat slob security needs to be fired. Just because youhave a HUGE belly does not make you a security guard.
🐷🐷🐷
Drakula 2017 trailer😁
Amazing woman, rising to the occasion when needed.  Very brave, very smart and excellent decision making.  She is truly an american hero.  This video will be used for decades in law enforcement training.
Nurse lives matter
In america when you don&#39;t respect the law you get shoot and when you respect the law you are arrested and dragged by force WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK HELL ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was the best nurse I&#39;ve ever had
Power Trip to the max. Cops with daddy issues shouldn&#39;t be hired.
WTF JUST HAPPENED!?! 😲
Is this white privilege?
If you don&#39;t break the law I will arrest you.
This is a disgusting display of ego.  This cop is supposed to be in this specialty unit that draws blood from his or suspects. HE SHOULD KNOW THE LAW AND HOW IT PERTAINS TO HIS VERY SPECIFIC JOB!!!! He should be reprimanded and sue excessive use of force and wrongful arrest. A sad display of uneducated ego.
Well this pisses me off
Hope the crazy cop gets fired.
The pigs can do whatever the fuck they want. They could have shot her, shot the patient and everyone in the ER and I&#39;m not even sure they&#39;d get in any trouble. America is fucked. So glad to be Canadian. One day history will call this &quot;Trump&#39;s America&quot; the same way we use the phrase &quot;Hitler&#39;s Germany&quot;.
Yesssss. hopefully they bumped her head 3 or 4 times while shoving her into back of patrol car!
But she&#39;s white?
Wow, this cop truely was over reacting and should face serious administrative or career ending punishments....
Stupid police
This is why I don&#39;t trust police. Why to much power and no one to keep them in line. This is not right and I feel for this woman all she was doing was her job. I hope this officer gets what he deserves in jail
This is disgusting behaviour!!! How the fuck do American police get away with this?? how do they even get jobs??
If she was black she probably would be a statistic at this point.
What many dont realize is that the same officer who arrested her had just recently been in a car chase with a fleeing criminal that lead to a horrific end. The fleeing vehicle swerved purposely into a semi truck, and hit it strait on, causing an huge explosive fireball to engulf the semi and car. The criminal died, and the semi truck driver is in critical condition with burns all over. That truck driver was a police reserve. So yes, this police officer was wrong, but many people don&#39;t realize what police go through and especially what this officer had gone through just recently.
See its not only black ppl the cops slap bs laws on
America !! F**k...you.
God bless America!!!
She was arrested for doing her job wtf
Oh yes, trust the police, trust the government, they are there for you, they are there to help. No need for guns, police will help you :^]
This makes so little sense on so many levels. Clearly she had the hospital policy in hand. Could the officer not read? Secondly arresting the nurse was not going to solve anything. What was his next plan arrest the next ER nurse that denies him patient access?
hope she&#39;s doing okay... this is what happens when cretins join the police force
This dirty cop must be fired from his job!
USA USA wait....
that escalated quickly
What the fuck? How was this allowed?
Can someone explain what happened i don&#39;t understand
Pigs
Jam outside investigators up that department&#39;s ass and let them chew their way out
I was watching the Police press news about how awful this was but the Police press officer is just telling the public what they want to hear there will not be any actual change until Federal agents verify compliance with the Law. That Police press guy will just go back into his office and wait for the next incident like this. There is an old saying Trust but Verify and it applies here too. Utah resident will learn the hard way that by the time something like this raises its head it is much worse internally. Alabama had to learn the hard way back in the 1960s.
I really can&#39;t stand america police serious Arsehole scum, trigger word must be no
If she did draw a blood sample then she won&#39;t be arrested in first place!
Respect to the nurse for keeping it 100. Very professional and takes patient privacy seriously. I hope she gets some sort of reward for how she handled this situation, some sort of professional recognition
People be saying they don&#39;t trust cops and shit and won&#39;t call them. Good, when you&#39;re in an emergency, don&#39;t bother calling 9-11.
That poor lady
WTF is wrong with america
???? confused
Too many LOUSY COPS that don&#39;t know the rules, or are to STUPID to remember them, so they make up rules as they go along to fit their own needs.<br><br>Absolutely pathetic.
ok wtf
Regardless of what happens to these police officers(and I couldn&#39;t care less what happens to their careers), the entire department should be required to take a course in jurisprudence.
Dang where were all y&#39;all at during the shootings y&#39;all all surprised acting like this is brand new lmao
America seems like a nice country to be a doctor.
Thankfully the nurse was white; had she been black, cities would have been looted and protests filled the streets. But she&#39;s white, so its not too relevant. Carry on.
Welcome to American, we&#39;ll arrest you even if you&#39;re following the law.
I did not even know our Federal Government had a civil rights division until former DOJ Eric Holder flew into that MO town and pumped up the volume on a local case that had nothing to do with civil rights. Fast forward today this case is an actual civil rights violation and not even a peep from our Federal civil rights division. We have seen this type of behavior before back in the 1960s Alabama where cops used dogs and fire hoses to violate peoples rights. This bad cop is a danger to the public because this time he used physical force and the next time this bad cop could use his firearm when his emotions override the Law of the land.  I think our Federal civil rights division should be shut down because that Federal civil rights division is just used as a tool to empower a far leftist agenda and has nothing to do with actual civil rights.  The State of Utah condoning this behavior will only make more incidents like this happen. I would recommend  Federal assistance because the State is condoning this behavior and next time it could be a mother with children present when this happens again.
I love how nowadays the actions of one person get automatically assigned to the entirety of the group he is a part of. These comments are full of people talking about &quot;pigs&quot; and &quot;fucking cops&quot; as if this person being an idiot represents them all. These are the same people who get to vote on who runs the country. Why am I not surprised we put a con man into power?
Hope the cop was fired- not good.
Fuck the police
If she was African American i swear this would spark like another L.A Riot but in Utah. Like the Utah Riots.
God bless the nurse and fuck the cop.<br>USA the protector of freedom and democrat....you said? He&#39;s just stupid this guy
wtf is wrong with law officials in the USA???
All I can say is,that cop is in some serious trouble. What a fricken cowboy.he has taken authority that he doesn&#39;t have.he obviously needs some continuous education on the scope of his duties.shame on him
There is actually a court case where the us police force successfully defended their right to discriminate against recruits with a high IQ
What happens when a cop has watched too much 24.  News flash officer, Jack Bauer is just a TV show.
I am Triggered at this Police man touching my fellow brethren I mean sisthren. You will be speaking to my lawyer and Women&#39;s rights activist, Misty.
I couldn&#39;t watch this without getting pissed off
Piggies being piggies...
Lol at these comments.<br>White America is SHOCKED. Everyone else is just watching and shaking their heads.
Is there any videos or news reports on the accident itself.
If she was black she would of been shot by the police.
Police are the public military. The u.s. version hitlers gestapo.
Don&#39;t resist or run if a cop says you&#39;re being arrested.  Screaming won&#39;t help anything.
Bet this guy&#39;s a hanzo main
Fucking pigs
Cops are shit
Fucking pigs
they should kill all cops
She&#39;s exactly right. She has a college education, these cops probably didn&#39;t even graduate from high school. They surely don&#39;t know about law.
i&#39;m a student nurse and watching this scares me. who the hell does he think he is? stupid. rot.
I&#39;m not sure to like the video because it&#39;s important this was shared, or to dislike representing my discontentness with what happened lol
Don&#39;t bring that shit to Brooklyn, that lady don&#39;t have a husband? Hmm
Wait...what did she do again
assault and battery..  false imprisonment..   putting the very victim they created life in danger once again in the burn unit, pulling the very nurse caring for him..  terrorizing the community in the high speed chase and terrorizing the hospital....
listen to Payne&#39;s body cam..   he told the other officers he was going to arrest her.   he told them this is a &quot;F ucking dumb nurse and I&#39;m going to arrest her....
wow an entire community terrorized by the very people who are paid to protect them.....
This video is kind of dumb. Sure there&#39;s a tiny percentage of cops like this guy that are just tryhard losers but if she knew she didn&#39;t do anything wrong why did she resist so much, like it&#39;s not like she was going to go to jail and be convicted of anything. Even the resisting of arrest would have been dropped but you don&#39;t have to make a scene if you know you&#39;re innocent
Just another high handed PIG!! I wouldn&#39;t piss on a cop if it was on fire!!!!! If that was my wife he be gettin a good old boot fuckin!!!
Why is it illegal to take blood from someone that&#39;s unconscious? They wouldn&#39;t be awake when the needle is in them 😂😂😂
unbelievable <br>what are the requirements to be  cop in the US? looks like any idiot can be one there
It&#39;s fair to summarize that as a officer that your officially done!
Jesus that gave me anxiety
wow and we got people who fully support this mess....
USA is going down... A retarded president, American nazis(!?), Police out of control, racist protest, interracial tensions... This is the beginning of the end i think...
I will defend the majority of cops on the majority of issues but this is disgusting  and terrifying
Wow this comment section is cancer. Although I agree that this was too much of a use of force and this cop should definitely be charged or sued, these people man, are clueless. They&#39;re brainwashed to believe that after one video, just ONE video that all cops are evil and I hear shit like &quot;tHis is WhY I doN&#39;t trUsT COpS&quot; and a bunch of bs like that. Bitch the only thing keeping you from getting your ass mugged is your local cops (and m-16 if you know what I mean). And please please PLEASE don&#39;t pull me up with one of those police brutality videos of black people. Most of them were committed by acts of being startled and even a lot of them are because of self defense. We need to stop summing up conclusions about one another based on one example or situation. Like this in for case, this is one of them. Not all cops are violent, and most of them are the best people i know and I give them 100% trust as they have 100% in us. Also, not all black people are that stereotypical gangs, thugs, and the bad people we here in media. It saddens me that we&#39;re still so stupid and misleading to believe things like this. Although it does disappoint me that a majority of black artist do talk about these things, why can&#39;t people like Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson bring back the soul in black culture, bring back the meaning and struggle of being black is. They need a voice.We see it in artist like Tupac and The Notorious BIG  but they showed us the struggle, and pain of living in the hood, and we need to fix that. But also, things like all Mexicans are drug addicts, all Muslims are terrorist, all white people are racist, all asians are smart and tech nerds, and every other thing imaginable (if I didn&#39;t mention your race or ethnicity don&#39;t get upset) I hope this solution of not assuming conclusions of all races/ethnicity based on one video or piece of evidence. And I truly think that will stop racism, just watch it happen.
At times like this there&#39;s something us folks need to say together <br><br><br>Fuck the (bad) police coming straight from the underground a young lady got it bad cause she frowned
That cop should have his *ss handed to him. The driver was burned. Yet the cop wants cause more pain..wtf?
As a military veteran and man, if I had been there and that was my wife or girlfriend, that fu**ing cop would have been put on the ground and I would have been in jail.
As a practicing kick ass expert, I would love to meet that cop in a pub.
should have placed the cop under citizens arrest.
America!! fuck yeah!.....what a fucking joke!....martial law is comin and already happening
Hes basically on holiday right now.. ya&#39;ll got me fuk<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23d">#d</a> up!
That was intense but I liked it
Injustice like this happens all the time to black people but as soon as a white woman get a little mistreated people fucking loose there minds
This officer should be fired.
Why do cops do this? (pls note im not trying to make a flame war)<br><br>But in another culturally similar country, let&#39;s just say Australia, this WILL not happen.<br>Just why?
Look a white cop hating on a white woman, so police brutality doesn&#39;t just happen to black citizens?  I guess we need to start WLM movement now? It sucks what happen to that nurse, but that thought quickly gets replaced by how one group of people feel cops and others in power are more oppressive to one group, it&#39;s stupid.  One can quickly do a YouTube video of white cops abusing their power to white citizens.  Enough of that, sorry for the rant.  Back to the nurse though; she clearly told the officer of the &quot;law&quot; that it is unlawful to obtain that blood, and doing so, would make any findings of that blood inconsequential.  Lastly, the nurse was trying to do the cop justice by informing him unless one of the three things are met then it is unlawful and can be thrown out if used in a court of law, but instead the cop just gets himself in more trouble by overstepping the law he swore to uphold... sad...
Denver PD has to follow protocols and conform with laws. Why on earth is a hospital nurse telling Jeff Payne how he should do his job?<br>1. Get a warrant etc<br>2. No warrant - no blood sample<br>3. You can&#39;t arrest me like this<br>No surprise that nurse was scared due to Payne lashing out and forcefully manhandling her.<br>That guy does not belong in law enforcement for damn obvious reasons.
This is fucked up.
Background story???
Am I the only one who doesn&#39;t know WTF is going on.....
That&#39;s bs, I actually hate this
I am just wondering if you&#39;re family and or other innocent people with a baby had been hit, with this car and the only way to prove, whether this person is guilty or innocent of driving with or without drink or drugs, in there system is a minor blood test. Would you all be still saying that the cops are wrong to ask for the sample?  Especially if people die as a result of this accident. If the cops can get a warrant for the blood sample later that covers the time it was taken from the patient then were is the problem?  If said warrant is not granted then the hospital can dispose of the sample and the police would never get there hands on it. I understand about red tape and people&#39;s rights but it sometimes seems that the guilty party, can get more justice than the innocent who suffer. I mean it could work in favour of the guy who is unconscious, proving him innocent also. Just saying, maybe laws need to change a bit. 
This just disgusts me
Only in America.......
Leftists: This is rac... sexism.
Staged
She&#39;s gonna be rich
What in the world??!!! The cop has no f*<b>**</b> right to do what he did!!
Wowwwww
Wtf
FUCK THE POLICE!
By law she did not have to give him the blood. She was doing her job.
SonofaB!..In Canada we call this Abuse of power and it&#39;s a shame.The man needs to be fired for his actions and paye damages for what he did to the nurse.
Disgusting
This day and age no one is free, we are all slaves to the system. These police men who abuse there authority should be counted as terrorists. The system no longer has a part where we civilians have rights anymore. And it&#39;s only gonna keep getting worse. We can all see that this world is becoming more evil and cruel. And I hope that each and everyone of you guys reading this are followers of Christ because the rapture is going to come and we&#39;re gonna leave before the worst hits.<br><br>If you would like to be one of those who goes to the rapture watch this video, because it&#39;s probably the most important video you will ever watch in your life.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbb4xwYj19g">https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g</a><br><br>God bless each and everyone of yous, and I hope to see yous in heaven
Nurse Wubbles.....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂LMAO IM FUCKIN DYING!!!!
Murica. Greatest country in the world!!
This is absolutely disgusting. I hope the nurse is okay and the cop is punished for this.
Does anyone know what happened to the cop?
Not only did the cop made an unlawful arrest, but he is recklessly endangering her patients in the hospital that were under her care while being detained from her post!! Disturbing and disgusting. Hope he enjoys his paid leave in hell.
The nurse was just doing her job and putting her patient as first priority and she gets arrested? That&#39;s bullshit
awesome another fucking criminal with a badge (cop) gets paid leave &quot;awarded&quot; vacation for breaking someones rights this happens way to much, criminals with badges are no different than criminals without them this is not justice this is tyranny. this nurse needs to sue this criminal hard and make sure this piece of shit gets his badge taken away and go to jail for sometime for this bullshit.
Drops pen..<br>Cop: Nope, im done your underarrest.
You&#39;re a woman in Trumps America did you really think you had any authority over a man? Let alone a police officer? Get used to this girls its your life now! Get used to it or get out! (By the way this is total sarcasm and the cop should be fired named and publically shamed  im just sitting here across the pond laughing at the state of your &quot;land of the free&quot;)
🐖
Rewatched this again because three videos are still on trending​. The officer has a big fragile ego. He couldn&#39;t take a no and when the guy over the phone told him you&#39;re making a big mistake, this idiot lost it LMFAO Honestly, he&#39;s like a child who throws a fit but with a badge and in the body of an adult
FUCK TRUMP!!!!
That&#39;s sad. <br>Can someone tell me if the nurse was right about not drawing blood without the patients consent.?
The officer saw a threat to his power trip and immediately decided to intimidate and bully people. This isn&#39;t something that just appears out of nowhere in an officer: this is cultivated, raised up in a LEO. So tell me again how it&#39;s just a few bad apples?
I guess the cops are just doing their jobs right ?
Disgusting, wow arresting a nurse in such a disastrous event
I think the purge should be allowed in America, get people like this who think they&#39;re better than the rest and shove the assholes down a fee pegs. Maybe if they didn&#39;t have a corrupt fucking government aswell as everything else wrong with America this wouldn&#39;t happen. How fucking dare you handle someone like that who physically did not resist other than say I have done nothing wrong. <br><br>Utterly fucking disgusting.
An example needs to be made with these horrible police who abuse their power.  I am an RN, and no question what this nurse did was correct and the police officer was completely out of his boundary.  Horrible Horrible evil man!  LOCK HIM UP! MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS PIECE OF WORK OFFICER AND EVERY OTHER ONE WHO IS LIKE HIM.   Clearly he has chosen the wrong profession and should be fired.
I completely agree with all the comments that&#39;s it&#39;s wrong, but why would this cop that did such a horrible thing release his own footage? He&#39;s like shooting himself in the foot lol
Fucking American police force angers the fuck out of me there&#39;s something fundamentally wrong with it I think
The police are out of control.  A bunch of cowards behind badges
I think I lost brain cells reading all the stupidity in the comments.
and people ask why cops get attacked and shot in the streets lol
white privilege right?
This cop  should be the one getting arrested
You can&#39;t give such emotional power freaks a badge.  There has to be a mental exam where an officer has to stay calm under constant verbal abuse to pass cause this lady didn&#39;t do anything outright rude and got this type of treatment.  God damn crazy!  I know the argument is most officers are normal which is true but the some who get crazy like this can traumatized another human being for life, that has to be stopped :/  (my opinion might suck I don&#39;t know too much on the matter)
Omg 😮
He should be charged with assult and sacked from his job. Clearly he is a fucking idiot and a danger to everyone.
This cop was clearly a freaking idiot. You can&#39;t arrest someone for following the the law, he has it backwards. &quot;She&#39;s the one who told me no&quot; SCREW YOU. And if he  was going to arrest her that&#39;s still no excuse for the way he assaulted her. This is *illegal. I hope this woman takes him to court.
That cop should go to jail
Fucking cowardly cops. I bet she sues for millions and wins.
Start a gofundme to sue these low life&#39;s.
This is why I&#39;m proud to be a Canadian
And what&#39;s sad about it they probably  both work for the  county
This bully policeman should be in jail for assaulting that nurse!
Oh no! Only if you have white privilege, uh america!.....oh wait
Better than a bullet..
Military 》piglice!
This officer was CLEARLY out of line as well as His superiors, and proper action should be taken as a result of this incident! SHOCKING that a US Law enforcement agency  would conduct themselves in such a way !!!! SHAMFUL!!!!!!
There is a big picture and an individual perspective.<br> Either way this jack booted thug should be jailed. The nurse has no standing in crime. Merely a committed participant. Simply put, was it my wife his ass is kicked.
she just found out what is like to be black in america
If her family was the victim of the drunks crimes, that nurse would have a sample so fast. I love watching hypocrisy. So when he wakes up and he is sober, the cop has no evidence, way to help put criminals away. Think about the victim and the victims family. I bet they watching this video getting mad because she&#39;s obstructing justice. I dont know the story, but the real justice is for the victim of this drunk, not some power tripping nurse. Cops also power trip when society tries to educate them about the law.
Lmao the cop is so retarded it&#39;s hillarious. The guy on the phone literally says why are you blaming the messenger and not the rules in place  (even though they&#39;re perfectly fair). And all his response is because she&#39;s telling me no. Lmao. How much of a nincompoop are you.
Can&#39;t wait for this cop to be on life support and she pulls the plug on him
And this is why you beat your women daily.
This dumb ass cop! If she had givin the blood, she would have been fired and/or prosecuted for illegally giving it and the hospital potentially sued. It&#39;s as if the cop is offended she said NO to him?! He let his power of authority get to his head.
Nurse Wubbles proves one thing, weevils Wubble but they don&#39;t fall down! You go girl, sue his arse!
America: <br>Climate change is denied,<br>Health care costs half of your soul,<br>Hates the LGTB community <br>And now police can arrest you for follow your corporate policy<br><br>I&#39;m scared of going into America now
Civil rights violated?<br>1) Cops get paid leave. <br>2)Police investigate themselves. <br>3)Lawsuit viable. <br>4)Tax payers foot the bill and forget about it in a one week news cycle.<br><br>Everyone wins. America. Fuck yea !
Can someone explain to me why is this trending?
No men stepped in to stop that officer. <br>50 years ago all the men in the room would have stopped that officer.<br>50 years ago the message of the Gospel was more prominent.
tabarnak
What I don&#39;t understand is, how the other moronic police officers watched and/ or went along with him. All it took was for one of the other officers to tell him to calm down.
Just imagine how many patients were left unattended because of that cop.
She has some Casey Neistat teeth
This is why we need to deport all mexicans
This detective violated here rights and had not probable cause to arrest the nurse  he needs to be fired. The only way to force this issue is a lawsuit. Without the body cams, how many other people has this officer assaulted? This is the reason why body cams need to be manditory. We need to get these ass hole cops off the force!!
I don&#39;t get it why did she get arrested?
It&#39;s funny how the guy with the camera gets arrested just to show what he&#39;s done illegally as a cop.
what in the fuck...that&#39;s basically kidnapping.
He&#39;s just a pig. Like almost every single one out there. They act above the law. What a pig!
As a nurse my self I applaud her for protecting her patient! 👏
Assholes like this thug-in-uniform are why even White civilians don&#39;t trust the cops.She&#39;s completely following the law.But because this fuckwit cowboy thinks being a cop means  getting  his way in all things all the time,he&#39;s going to aggressively manhndle a woman,something  that typically costs pro athletes and celebrities their careers,to show her who&#39;s boss.Fucking goon,I hope they throw his ass in jail.
He had better lose his job. This is unlawful arrest. He is likely one of those cops who would plant evidence to get a conviction. I don&#39;t know what the person did but they have rights under U.S. law, which he is supposed to uphold.
I upload a headlight every day
Greatest country in the world

That officer needs FIRED!!!!
This is to the arresting officer be happy it was a woman I would have broken your jaw this is why we have the 2nd Amendment to  defend ourselves against tyranny be happy. Because if I was there and I had a gun things would have been different
That&#39;s the policy police had with the hospital and they arrested her? WTF? He shouldn&#39;t be an officer, he escalated that situation so quickly.
The police white racists created SMH.
Can someone give the world an update of this nurse situation??
As Don King would say &#39;Only in America&#39;
These fucking retarded police dont have a clue what their doing if the woman is innocent, which it seems like, having police arrest or anything criminalistic to a medical profession is the worse thing to happen. This makes me mad cause u dont treat nurses and doctors like this, they&#39;re like angels on earth.
I&#39;m surprised someone didn&#39;t beat that cops ass and restrain him when he assaulted her.
This has to be fake.  Why did this &quot;cop&quot; have a camera on him showing everything he was doing?  If it&#39;s not fake then this is the absolute dumbest police officer in the world.
America is so sad. When black people complain about police brutality people always say &quot;stop being thugs&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t resist arrest and nothing will happen to you&quot; or &quot;maybe he/she has a criminal record so how they were treated is justifiable&quot;. I just hope this video opens the eyes of some of those people who immediately jump to the cops defense, sometimes they&#39;re ACTUALLY in the wrong.
Damned pig needs to die! Such despicable conduct of so-called law enforcement. No honorable conduct at all. Until these kinds of stupid acts by pigs has ceased forever; this further shows, their destruction is our ONLY salvation.
She is spool lucky. All recorded. Easy lawsuit. Open and shut. As wrong as her arrest is, let&#39;s not go feeling sorry for her
This guy needs to go to jail
This is why police officers all over the wotld have no respect...because of hard headed do whatever the frik i want cus im abov3 the lae jack ass cops like this guy...he should lose his effen pension too...
I live in Utah, and this makes me sad.
Your government loves you, can&#39;t you tell?
Meanwhile in Canada, a cop was called into a Walmart because a man was trying to steal some dress clothes. The cop ended up letting the shoplifter go and paid for his clothes. Turns out the shoplifter was down on his luck and was stealing them for a job interview. <br><br>We have our fair share of asshole cops here too, but many of them are honest, average, pleasant people. The cop in this video, however, is clearly a slimy douchecanoe.
Here the crash :<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEeSmhTyM5o">https://youtu.be/xEeSmhTyM5o</a><br><br>But i dont understand if the video from above was uploaded a month ago ,why did these nurse videos were uploaded now?
Meh😒 first world&#39;s problems
How come nobody is talking about the fact that the sob cop was heard talking about dumping all the  transient patients in the hospital as a reprisal? Apparently he also works as a part-time ambulance driver. <br><a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/09/02/footage-shows-slc-detective-who-arrested-nurse-saying-hed-take-good-patients-elsewhere/">http://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/09/02/footage-shows-slc-detective-who-arrested-nurse-saying-hed-take-good-patients-elsewhere/</a>
I kinda want to be a cop just to put my co-wokers in there place lmao
You know cops shit getting bad when even whites are being assaulted by cops.
White poeple - She didnt do anything wrong thats abusive<br>Black poeple - 😶😶🚪⬅🏃
It&#39;s completely not her fault if she was given the answer no then it&#39;s a no, he had no right to arrest her
Cmon guys we need to wait till we have all the facts. Oh wait she&#39;s white, nevermind.
This pisses me off so much.
Cop is a moron... should be fired for unlawfully arresting her. She should sue and get massively compensated along with a massive public apology.
Sick cop
The cop needs to go to jail for assault.
what a great free country america is. who will save americans from their regime ?
Its illegal for a officer to search a home or in this case ask for a patients blood without a warrant. I respect most police but there is some fucking police that I hate so fucking much because some acts like a god among mortal simply cause they got a badge. This officer illegally detained the nurse, if I was that nurse I would refuse the request of the patients blood for the patients privacy, tell the officer he is illegally detaining me and to get a warrant then walk away because that was an illegal detainment and an illegal arrest of some fucken pathetic piece of shit corrupt officers. I used to say I respect all officers until I experienced  corrupt officers. Fuck all of you corrupt police officers I like you equal to a serial killer why don&#39;t all of you corrupt cops fuck off and retire you dirty pieces of shit. Damn I&#39;m shaking cause I&#39;m so fucking pissed about the topic of corrupt police officers I swear you are all fucking pieces of shit.
Cop needs to be fired.
The police think they are so high and mighty. It&#39;s disgusting. She&#39;s trying to do her job!
<b>oh well, that&#39;s what I get for living in America. This shit.</b>
she protected her patient.
American justice system lol
what the fuck is wrong with this son of a bitch OMG !!!
what the fuck is wrong with this son of a bitch OMG !!!
Those other 3 officers have to take blame too, they just stood around watching and didn&#39;t do anything.
I guess this cop doesn&#39;t take no for an answer
USA is a corrupted country full off greedy and egoistic ppl🙂 im glad that i am living in a more human evolotionary country🙂
Wtf man what did she do
Home of the free? My ass...
Looks like YouTube made another cop famous good job YouTube or&#39;s
America, land of the free, where corrupt police do as they plea
I want to point out that the other 3 or 4 police officers were attempting to stop this idiot but couldn&#39;t because this idiot is a detective an outranks them. You can really see it in this longer video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU_RjebYDis">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU_RjebYDis</a>  The problem is always that these idiot corrupt officers overshadow the good ones that do exist. There are good police out their. But sadly the bad ones get the spotlight because they have the most extreme and dangerous effects on society.
So they arrested her for doing her job? Look up HIPAA. Considering the litigious nature of the US, it is against the law to release any patient information without consent; she could lose her nursing license without proper documentation, such as a warrant. It was simple, come back with a warrant. The Board of Nursing should have her back.
When is it ok for citizens to intervene? Why are the other officers not helping a citizen that is being forcefully kidnapped? If any non-police or military person did this the charges would be extreme. The punishment would definitely be jail-time &amp; most likely prison. Not paid leave.
She can get rich from this. That cop had no right + he recorded the whole thing. Body cams sure can weed out the bad cops.
that is just wrong!!!!!
How about a lawsuit,this is a banana republic
Ugh, words hurt brain, must attack woman who saves lives for living.
I just posted my first poem if you admire poetry as much as myself please watch thank you for your time
Leave this poor woman alone... Being a nurse would already suck enough...  she has to clean up old people shit all day, give her a break
