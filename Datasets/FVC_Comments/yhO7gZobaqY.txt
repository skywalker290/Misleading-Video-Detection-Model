woah!
what the fuck is that shit attentat ???? brussels or moscow???
This is Brussels  2016 you are liar , RT stole this video from the future !!!!!!!!!
FAKE  FAKE FAKE
RT tv not CCTV  looser
targeting random innocent citizens is sad and pathetic. instead of picking soft targets, these cowards should pick up arms against a military checkpoint or such (not that this is any better). what is accomplished in harming innocent people other than bad publicity??
Destruction is easy. Creation very difficult.
You sir, are and idiot. 
I like eggs
They are in their early teens or younger, getting a kick out of upsetting what they think are grown-ups.
There is to much ignorance to communicate peacefully
so sad 
it was the NWO who did this. Terrorism only exists in our minds. It is used to control us.
I pity all who are raised into the worship of Islam, so sad
Haha agreed.
i just checked with the democrats, they said no 
I can buy a $20 webcam at Walmart with clear images. Why is it that high tech security cameras have lower quality than a toaster? Were they designed and installed by the terrorists themselves?
Moment of explosion caught on tape at Domodedovo airport
July-19-2012-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev says the management at Domodedovo airport is responsible for security violations which led to a deadly blast at Russia&#39;s biggest air hub on Monday. A suicide bomber is suspected to be behind the attack, which killed 35 people and left around 180 injured. The blast took place in the international arrivals area and is the country&#39;s worst .
INFO-AWARENESS , VIKEN Z KOKOZIAN
Domodedovo airport ?
Id feel sorry for the children that were near that explosion :(
@halfdickhalil you know, people may be with you if you didnt have the language of a teenager, spelling of a grade schooler and the inability of taking the cap lock off while you type. that would make all of us happy :-)
@UPKODINS I sorry what??? Me no hablo chinese… Sorry. O.o?
@copperhead46 I&#39;m also from USA and yes I hope our country can find the idios behind this because of two reasons. One. I&#39;m going to this airport tomorrow, and I&#39;m part Russian.
Why are people writing in Chinese??? O.o?
the security is dead in this country!!! they took a bomb in the airport!!!! omg
У русских всегда кто то виноват, но только не они!
На мой взгляд самый страшный теракт в России , это нищие народ в богатой стране))
Вопрос! Почему? И кто виноват? 
@shdifu - The &#39;CCTV&#39; in the title stands for Closed Circuit TeleVision. It is quite popular all around the world and doe not use a manned camera.
Poetic Justice. As a Ukrainian I say that Russia is getting what it deserves. Payback for tsarist and soviet terror, imperialism and genocide
why the hell, somebody was filming this?
goddamit, thats why the world is so bloody, even on youtube people only fight with eachother,   70% of the comments is agressive.. really

people should learn to C O M M U N I C A T E ...
peacefully that is...
ぎゃー
@binkoly yeah whats so funny about this ? i hope you find it as amusing when people that matters to you are burned in flames and a dog pisses the fire off you fucking miserable excuse of a human being.

Hope Russian Spetsnaz find and kill whoever did this.  If it was jihadists, then I hope the United States can help kill these assholes alongside Russia.

Скорбим и помним......
I feel bad for those it has hurt :(
@l3lackout77 I have no idea what, if anything, will happen in 2012. The year 2000 was on a lot of peoples calendars as the one to watch. Regardless of what you believe, world events can&#39;t keep escalating the way they are for much longer. It will eventually all come to a head and something very bad will happen. What year that is, is anybody&#39;s guess.
No radical Muslims here, only Israeli employees and patsies.
Disgusting....my heart goes out to the lost loved ones. 
I can help but notice that  wherever radical islam is practiced and promoted...the following elements are noticeably increased...robberies,  kidnappings for ramsom, illegal arms, gangs, extortion,  suicide bombings, terrorism planning &amp; execution, Why is this so? Why is radical islam so loved when it is so destructive?
@Nitrorus Well it looks like you cant even speak English properly, so we all know that asking you for your intelligent opinion on the matter would be absurd. This is a matter of far fetched infusion with terrorism. You cant just rely on inaccurate and Sully in-valued opinions like yours, so sometimes it is of the utmost importance to keep yourself quiet and be-frayed because of your lack of knowledge and simply out of respect for the actual victims...
@rubroxato88 Well that is a harsh way of putting it considering you obviously think you are some kind of genius in geography. Your facts are not truly facts my friend. The facts are being manipulated by so many before they are actually reaching you that they are not facts anymore by the time they get to you. So it is not actually ur fault. I can tell you that I am 62 yrs old and have studied geography since I was a softmore at Tennessee State Univ. I can&#39;t say that u r wrong in opinion.   
@miturbinesdurti Are you ever-so right. To me, its the facts of the Bible coming into play as times goes slowly on towards 2012. Given the facts and the possible scenarios for the events that may take place on Dec. 21st 2012, I think that with all the knowledge that people have about it will manipulate their behavior on this day. I myself believe that the Electric Magnetic Pulse (EMP) Will take place on this given day for the simple fact that, that is what happeneds every 25,800 Years.HowboutU  
this is very sad!!! it is just too sad... i was crying when i heard what happened.. poor people. the saddest thing is that it is not the first time!!! moi iskrennie soboleznovaniya sem&#39;yam pogibshih!!!!  
why hasn&#39;t this been on TV?! i havent seen anything at all
на то чтобы разбираться и искать виновных есть правительство,а задача народа-помогать всеми силами.Мне очень жаль что я никак не могу помочь пострадавшим(я даже кровь не могу сдать-мне только 15 лет) хотя я переживаю и внимательно смотрю выпуски новостей,стараясь отследить события происходящие на месте этого ужасного преступления!
Ребята о каких вещах можно говорить если в очередной раз произошло горе!опять погибли люди,опять в чьи то семьи пришла беда!почему это произошло именно в нашей стране?год назад был терракт в метро,и я лично хорошо помню,как мои родители и я переживали и не могли дозвониться до брата!поверьте,это крайне тяжело!просто надо выразить соболезнования семьям пострадавших,и просто стараться чем то помочь-например пойти и сдать кровь!это же не так трудно,и не надо сейчас вести разговоры о виновниках
@MADNEXXION Special Forces or the masses. 
@miturbinesdurti ok thats right my bad. so its needed special forces to deal with these criminals?
Im going to go live on the moon im tired of these kinds of fucking people .....well if it were habitable which it isn&#39;t so I guess I&#39;am forced to stay here with the maniacs.
did this really need to be uploaded
Jack Nicholson: &quot;I warned them&quot; 
@MADNEXXION Focus like a laser beam... I said the assassins are from South America. As in countries that have special forces that we helped to train. Ex-military from South American countries are going to work for the Mexican drug cartels as mercenaries. This is why they do so well against the Mexican police and regular army. They are well trained and well equipped.

Im assuming everyone in that flash-range died because of all the shrapnel. Its crazy nowadays, we&#39;re so insensitive, we watch people die like its nothing.
Omfg
Remember... No Russian
sometime people can be soo stupid..
@O6pe3 you have no basis dipshit just go and play your video games little boy 
@bapcmi 
jeez, what a bullshit!
ofc it was caucasus.
u dont live here &amp; dont know shit!
ZEITGEIST MOVING FORWARD OFFICIAL RELEASE 2011 ON YOUTUBE

/watch?v=4Z9WVZddH9w
the russians  confirmed that it wasnt from the north Caucasus an area predominantly muslim it was probably some skin head or neo nazi gang which russia has spreading out of control 
@mtv637 I&#39;m talking about middle east Muslims buddy
I&#39;m glad this shit happened. AMERICA all the way baby!
@oakcliff621 no the Israelis have Jets nuclear bombs missile air defense system  drones why would they blow themselves up?
@ace009ful 

chechens are muslim!
пиздец  !!!!заебали 
@miturbinesdurti southamerica is too large. and does not include mexico. 
Everyone it was Chechens not Zionist Jews or Muslims stop making stupid accusations
in russia, you kill bomb
man i dont understand why someone would do this
Remember, no Russian.
Hmm....One more whisper from the religion of peace.
Bastards.
REVENGE!
@zlee415 bush took away them all (cameras) by himself.
@nearlyape that&#39;s a good question :)
@Omanaji not really or he wouldnt have made that statement?
@nearlyape 
aint it obvious???!!!
@nearlyape Probably because I am sure that everything was destroyed. A building falls on a dvr and most likely its going to get ruined. That would be the most likely situation.
@simhopp You are so wrong...
@HerroHerrar what IRA?Irish Republican Army? individual retirement arrangement?? International Reading Association????
@QHIZ because most don&#39;t want to do it. It&#39;s a part of their cause
Islam has produced flying carpets, flying body parts and flying into buildings.
@vorjay Well I was home sick yesterday and all I had to do was surf the net.  If you don&#39;t know what The Catcher in the Rye maybe it&#39;s you that watches too much Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.  It&#39;s a Novel thats considered one of the top 100 all time English writings of all time...it was mentioned in the Movie &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot;.  Mel Gibson was brainwashed by the government to compulsively buy the book because the GOV was tracking sales and would always know his location....get it now?
:(
@emlvsmm you say russiand hate americans true...... but dont forget  china or russia have muslims  you just you say that russia should kill her own children if they are muslims 
@nearlyape we dont need cctv for Sep 11th because it was 2 planes hi-jacked not suicide bombings
It&#39;s striking how normal and routine the video looks until the explosion.
Damn, poor innocent people. Shit happens in this world that you just can&#39;t do anything about. Fuck
Russians hate Americans, Americans hate British, British hate Chinese...what it all boils down to is we need to realize the real enemy is Islam. They hate everyone and will stop at nothing to kill all who oppose their insane and radical religious views.
Don&#39;t worry people, Russia is just following our governments lead by staging attacks on it&#39;s own citizens. Now due to this incident we are gonna have to get a body cavity search just to ENTER the airport! Or maybe a &quot;terrorist&quot; will attempt this at one of our airports but will be caught before the act and then dumbass obama will get on tv saying how America stopped an attack on it&#39;s own self. Lifes a bitch.
fuckin dumb ass ppl just running around n blowin themselves up.
:(
Did you know that the Russia president(of Chechnya republic) is blaming Amerika and not Muslims

watch?v=DUcS8oXohHE
@Nukethelotofthem1 ........... HAAAAAAAAH , nice joke, shit
@coolguy2500 Heard of the IRA?.... Massive car bombs weighing hundreds of pounds are being dismantled on a damn near weekly basis in Northern Ireland to this day. NI has recently had bombs explode, and police officers assassinated. &amp; i can assure you they are not muslims commiting these acts of terrorism. People just hear less about other forms of terrorism going on all around the world, and assume its not happening anywhere else. 
Shouldnt the Russian prime minister and president be looking to solve the problem instead of just trying to &quot;punish thoes who are responsible&quot;. Besides i bet theese guy(s) didint have acceptance to this attack from the leader of the north caucasian seperatists. Its like that with the PLO in the 80s and 90s. People did stuff in PLOs name, there for gave palestinians a bad rep.
@nearlyape because usually CCTV cameras are NOT  pointed at the top of buildings
@jdphil07 FBI confiscated all CCTV footage from nearby buildings that showed the plane hit the pentagon. Nobody has seen it since.
i sure hate that for the russian people. i hope they catch those pieces of shit and give them what they got coming to them!!!!!!!
Where was the suicide bomber? 

This video gets released but crazy man MK ultra Loughner Bot doesn&#39;t have his video rampage released or even parts of it? How many cameras did that shopping center have? I bet at least 10.
R.I.P. 
yah let&#39;s blame a popular violent shooting game for  SUICIDE BOMBING!!!! makes perfect sense.
this is beginning of election campaign Putin.  I hope you remember what time Mr. Putin became president last time?
@coolguy2500 Timothy McVeigh?
@nearlyape FOR THE SAME REASONS WE CAN&#39;T SEE WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN OKC. THERE ARE ENOUGH PIECES OF THE PUZZLES TO SEE WHAT THE BIG PICTURES LOOK LIKE. THE EVENTS THEMSELVES ARE SIDESHOWS THAT KEEP THE FOCUS AWAY FROM WHAT THEY USHERED IN. 
@shadowq2 OR MAYBE... you will get into your right mind, and worry about me not killing all you racist fucks...
@nearlyape Because everything was planed by the government  
@CristinaY2J Sorry to ruin your day like that. It sticks with you for a while, but now you know the truth, there is evil in men. A friend of mine didn&#39;t believe me when I told him what these radical muslims are doing. After I showed him he wished he had just taken my word for it. This is why the liberal utopian dream of world peace will never be real, because there is evil in men and we will spend our entire existence preparing to defend our selves against people like that.
@nearlyape yeah, go figure that there would be more &quot;freedom of the press&quot; in Russia than in the U.S. Personally I think there&#39;s some &quot;conspiracy stuff&quot; going on when it comes to why 911 footage is still being supressed. Even if there isn&#39;t any conspiracy, it&#39;s still pretty messed up that the government in &quot;big evil russia&quot; is more honest and transparent with it&#39;s own citizens than the U.S. government.
seems like muslims are building step by step their exctinction... because if it will be a war againt islam, it will be the last for them
@letvisky They are not guilty for what their Government is doing !
@miturbinesdurti I will never forget what I just saw.....How can they live with themselves after such a thing? These monsters are still free??? 
Obviously the Chechen Muslims. Just go to LiveLeak(dot)com and search for Chechen beheading throat cut. You will find the long history of the Chechen&#39;s &quot;religion of peace&quot; against the Russians.
@letvisky a british person died there u fucker, he had a 6 month old daughter and was engaged
@Savage272 Excellent post and I agree with what you wrote here
@AlexCCCP2277 amen, fuck them damn sandies
@autigers002 
That&#39;s what I did. So, that&#39;s my conclusion. 
How do all you guys know its a Muslim who did this? 
@franky543 That&#39;s true. lol
Islam is a religion of peace. 

Piece of shit that is! 
truthtube.tv

Fuck Islam!!!
@tajsalman I think you&#39;ve been smoking too much of your own dope.
@tajsalman What about all those school children murdered in that siege in Russia a few years back by Chechnyan terrorists. If Russia took out Chechnya with a Nuke I&#39;d say they had it coming.
Let the games begin! Who will Putin go after? anyone anyone
@ICanSlightlyFly Oh yes they do.
 Russia is not politically correct like the West and she can do what she likes to find who did this. I hope President Medvedev kicks the crap out of these murdering bastards .
@ICanSlightlyFly yea well....keep wearing them rose colored glasses. have a nice life

BOOM
@ICanSlightlyFly okay all Muslims aren&#39;t murderers.  They just have a believe system that&#39;s Homophobic, Anti-semitic, anti-women, and justifies the violent attacks against innocent civilians they deem as non-believers and western people should be apologists for a religion that is stuck in the dark ages....does that sound better for you?
@ZackTheCrackSalesman ...... u would have heard of GIVE RESPECT , GET RESPECT....... i would modify it to   IF YOU KILL, THEN BE KILLED..........SIMPLE
@mark9241 ..... only 1 thing to say aout you..... BRAINWASHED by ZIONIST MEDIA........ 
@vorjay  dont believe,, search it urself........

@ICanSlightlyFly was Beslan, Moscow Metro, The Moscow Apartment Bombings, The few commuter airlines, Domodedovo airport, and about 20 other Islamic inspired terrorists attacks not enough for you?
@mark9241 dumbass.
@ICanSlightlyFly oh liberty Radio says that....how come when a Muslim shoots a Russian soccer fan and the Russian Fans have a riot over it...it&#39;s the Russians that get arrested.  Are you aware there is 15-25 million Muslims in Russia you muppet. 
@myquill23 Um I don&#39;t watch much TV...I read mostly...usually The Catcher in the Rye...I can&#39;t seem to put that book down...as matter of fact if I go by a book store I&#39;m compelled to purchase it....I own about 24 copies of it.
@tajsalman millions?
taxi drivers in moscow are now charging up to 30,000 rubles ($1000+) for a cab ride..
@MrROTD My thoughts exactly! The reasons behind these things are almost to the point of becoming irrelevant....I&#39;m at the point where when these things happen, I say &quot;OK, what liberties are we going to lose because of this one?&quot;
milk that cow...


oddly enough wh yis it allways airports?
@myquill23 It&#39;s not that they won&#39;t go after me because I tow the line....I credit them not being able to find me due to my fancy tin foil hat.
Why is it a surprise that Extremist Muslims would do this? The West and Russia is waging war on them for Oil and territory so I really don&#39;t blame them for fighting back. On the other hand it could be a false flag attack, our Governments like to do that so the public will support aggression. Who knows anymore
@myquill23 is there some other definition of defensive that I&#39;m not aware of?  
@ICanSlightlyFly wikipedia . com/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents I looked from the late 90&#39;s to present...and you know what I apologize the vast majority of them were buddhists....oh wait...it says &quot;Islamic terrorism is considered a major threat to the security of the nation[10] with most terrorist activity taking place in Chechnya and Dagestan.&quot; there has been 23 major Terrorist attacks in Russia...They were all related to the Islamic caucuses.
ah yes, Mohammed would love this, the infidels are confused and fighting amongst themselves and the jihadist walk around willy nilly blowing themselves up for Allah

dhimmis everywhere
@JOZZ145 When you take them rose colored glasses off my effeminate British friend come and talk to me.
@ICanSlightlyFly Yea...what has happened....which I&#39;m sure had nothing to do with Islam.
@HerroHerrar Listening to all the Muslims, Jews, and Christians I can only Thank God......For making me an atheist!&quot;
@HerroHerrar You skimmed over the persecution of a Muslim is worse than the slaughter of non-believers part. Which is used to justify the Theo van Gogh murder.  He didn&#39;t like the fact your religion promoted Women hating and that was enough persecution of Muslims for a large part of the Dutch Islamic community to want to kill him.
The world is ruined by twats,my heart goes out to all the families affected by these idiots.
@MaudsPas if all these people were &quot;Scandinavian&quot; I think people would be saying....hmmm...why are all these Scandinavians blowing themselves up and killing innocent people.  Maybe...I dunno...There something wrong with there religion and/or culture that persuades them to blow themselves up...like say passages in there bible?  I dunno...It&#39;s a guess!
were exactly in the kron or how ever you  say the muslum bible dose it say to blow up people that do not belive? i havent  seen it so if anney one can get it pleas tell
@HerroHerrar typical islam...blame the Jews.  I&#39;m neither Russian or a Jew....your an anti-Semite though.
@myquill23 yes you did hit a nerve. you see....it&#39;s my conscious...I&#39;m living with the horrible fact of being a CIA/Illuminati conspirator...I was the one that trained the Ninja&#39;s in Kung-Fu that they used to take down North Tower of the World Trade building...however I wasn&#39;t responsible for the South Tower....that was Chuck Norris.
@trippinlikegod It has been a pleasure. I always love a good discussion...Glad you could also get past my NY attitude...lol....I tend to get rather sarcastic.
@HerroHerrar oh really....well nothing jewish about me.  Everything you guys say seem to sound like Dirka Dirka, Muhammad Jihad

....too each his own.
@MrJotunheim out of curiosity...Islam does not allow you to touch women, but it allows you to beat your women ...what exactly is the protocol when you beat your women?  Do you have to wear Rubber gloves and a condom or are you only allowed to use sticks?
@MaudsPas &quot;bottom dwelling fox news troglodytes&quot;

God those mindless idiots over there...
@trippinlikegod Well that I have to agree with
@trippinlikegod your forgetting that the western-world wen&#39;t through something called the Age of enlightenment and a few centuries of economic growth that completely changed our civilization.  The Islamic world is still stuck in the dark ages and those that come to the west seem to have dismissed our liberalization as satanic.  The Islamic world is being taken over by political Islam, from North Africa, Europe, Central Asia and Southern Asia...it&#39;s militant and rejects liberalism.
@trippinlikegod  The fact is they are doing these things in the name of God, and FOR their &quot;God&quot;. How many times have they said they are doing &quot;Allahs work&quot;?... This religion like all others is evil...They just play their book out in the literal sense.
@Danibanez600 Islam gives Muslims enough of a bad name...they don&#39;t have to be blowing themselves up to do it.
@trippinlikegod as for the director of that Docu....He was the Director....He didnt produce it.
@trippinlikegod Name the last time a Christian or Jew blew themselves up or anyone else up for that matter in the name of God?...Give me one example.
@ICanSlightlyFly um yea.  Keep being an enabler of Women hating, anti-semitic, medieval, muslims.
@trippinlikegod Of course the Palestinians aren&#39;t free to come and go as they want because every time they are they try to blow themselves up.
@trippinlikegod So I guess the religious rants we hear constantly from terrorists are just imagined gibberish?
@trippinlikegod well figuring there was something called the Christian crusades, than the Christian British took over, now Anglo-American Christians are in there country...it would be fair for the Iraq&#39;s to think perhaps they should be think that Christians may not like them very much.
@Yababoos123 so basically...the US Gov took your land put you on reservations, forced you to christianity, forced you to take anglo-american names, forced you to forget your own language and learn english, brought your people to the brink of extinction....but because they give you a check and let you set up casino&#39;s there the light of the world.
@trippinlikegod My point was...The Native Americans are surrounded...We didnt sit around crying victim. Stop playing the victim...stfu...and do something to help yourselves....If you wait for someone else to help you....Then well you will die and no one will care.
@vorjay He&#39;s a CT...The same people who think the US Govt did 9/11 and the same people who think Obama was born in Kenya....You have to use small words with them.
@myquill23 again...where&#39;s your proof before you spurt your thought diarrhea over the internet..
@trippinlikegod If its just the individual then why does Islam have so many of these individuals?
@Yababoos123 yea for some reason youtube didnt let me post the rest of that comment...I went on to explain how we helped ourselves and didnt cry victim.
@trippinlikegod The only Christians you can compare to as crazy are the Evangelicals which I prefer to call the Talibangelicals
@Yababoos123 I was using it as a reference thats why its been brought up.
@trippinlikegod No we are stuck on Reservations, US Government shutting off Peoples electricity, etc 
@trippinlikegod &quot;The &quot;i know a guy&quot; logic is flawed﻿ at every level&quot;

You want his Facebook account? Let him spew the crazy shit to you directly?
@ICanSlightlyFly You&#39;re a member of the kumbaya lets be tolerant of the intolerable cult.  
@Dt0x75 Your ego is a little to big for this page. Please refrain from posting more things that are as stereotypical and racist as this is in the future.
@trippinlikegod thats not the real VenomFangX
@trippinlikegod I gave you the name of the production company...or do you mean the director? Also Israel conquered that land...It happens...Im Native American but you dont see me running around trying to kill White Americans....
@myquill23 ...because you know.  I mean you&#39;ve got proof that someone else other than terrorists did this.  Becuase Russia a country that has a region of a few million ethnic groups that have been shooting police and blowing up building in the caucus for years really needs to set a false flag operation in there airport.
@agentcamo don&#39;t for get Dagestan.
@trippinlikegod I dont want to hear the shit that Islam is peaceful...When I can take you to a former friend of mine who is now a Muslim who continuously tells me the Jews are the enemy...He wont talk to me anymore since I sent his ass packin to the DHS but he is being taught dangerous bullshit....Jews and Christians are the Enemies of Islam is ALL he talks about...
@trippinlikegod Quixotic Media.....Now I bet you tell me the Jews funded it right?
@ICanSlightlyFly keep drinking that kool-aid.
@trippinlikegod Look its not a grand conspiracy...and thats not a propaganda film....
Well im going now... I suggest everyone google &quot;Islam: What the West Needs to Know&quot;
@Dt0x75 they are muslims
@MrJotunheim I knew you would say I was wrong...lol
@MrJotunheim You still havent answered the question....Anyone who speaks against Islam is suppose to die... Right or Wrong?.... Ofc you will say im wrong....but thats correct.....
@MrJotunheim &quot;there is nothing in﻿ Sharia that praise terrorist acts&quot;

No of course there isnt because you dont view this as terrorism.
@MrJotunheim If you are such a &quot;man of god&quot; then you need to tell people the truth.....Explain to them that under Sharia Law I can be killed for talking about Islam like this.... Tell them the truth!
@MrJotunheim You know damn well you arent telling everyone just what Sharia Law is
@MrJotunheim and?
FUCK ISLAM.
@MrJotunheim Now tell everyone what Sharia Law is...
@trippinlikegod Well in case you havent noticed these wars are against the politically correct term of &quot;Radical Muslims&quot;? We need to be fair and say it is a war against Islam...This will become fully apparent when Islam is stripped of its religious status under US Law. That is what the People want...Its going to take time but it will happen.
@MrJotunheim So you accept and want Sharia Law?...Now we are starting to peel back your layers.
@MrJotunheim Hows that Sharia law working out for you?
@trippinlikegod lol You assume I watch American media....I do know how to read...I do have a mind that I use on my own....civilians die in war it happens in every ...single....war....get over it!
@MrJotunheim Well look what they do....lol....
@trippinlikegod I dont follow any religion. They are instruments of control, but being that Islam is blatantly the most violent it has to go first.
 Blame and shame on russian militia-politia...
Russians, you are in my prayers.
that bomb sucks

My condolences
@MrJotunheim tell them what happens if you die while killing infidels
RIP to all the victims, this is horrible.
@MrJotunheim such bullshit....tell them what makes u a martyr
@MrJotunheim The only conspiracy I see here is you knowingly defending Islam and the fading image that it is a &quot;Religion of Peace&quot;
@trippinlikegod Ok ask our buddy here MrJot what his book says happens when he kills himself while killing infidels. Go ahead ask him...
@MrJotunheim Now its a conspiracy?....lol
FSB?
@trippinlikegod Chechens....What religion are they?
May their souls rest in perfect peace,Amen.
@Aandunno Atheist and bat shit crazy
@MrJotunheim That still does not remove the fact that Islam is the most violent religion on the planet...
@trippinlikegod he didnt do it in the name of god....there lies the difference.
@Dt0x75 Jared Loughner.
@MrJotunheim &quot;It tells that﻿ we have to live in peace with everybody except those who fight us&quot;

Now THAT is 100% Grade A Bullshit
This world will end in a terrible war among religions...
@MrJotunheim Why dont you tell everyone here what your &quot;holy&quot; book says you must do to any non-muslim....Go ahead and tell them...otherwise I will for you.
@MrJotunheim right...Ive talked to moderate Muslims and they say when things like this happen their &quot;religion&quot; teaches them to applaud such acts. The &quot;religion&quot; needs to be abolished and soon!
@MrJotunheim im not a kid...I have a very good understanding of your &quot;religion&quot; which is actually first and foremost a political ideology. 
@trippinlikegod They are all crazy but name the last time a Christian did something like this?
@MrJotunheim lol thats funny...because the last moomoo I talked to said there was no real use for Jihad...Now I see you saying its army vs army? So which is it moomoo?
@MrJotunheim Agreed ~
epic
Question: Does Mohammad provide the jihadist with 72 tubes of KY Jelly upon arrival at &quot;paradise&quot;?

Who the fuck wants 72 VIRGINS?! That would be extremely painful and frustrating. Says a lot about the thought process of certain cultures.

Btw, I have screwed a lot of your Muslim sisters - but they only let me put it in the ass. Real talk.

So, technically u will marry a virgin - but make sure u don&#39;t slip down south. U may fall into the abyss. At least u&#39;ll be able to hang a bloody cloth right?
all victims RIP
Wow, how many people, even on  the comments - are nuts and want war with the whole world for the &#39;better&#39; of their country. We are all brothers and sisters, flying on earth trough space at 10.000MPH thinking we know what is good. Does anyone notice what is RIGHT? Put your weapons down claiming to fight for peace that way.., make love... it is our Resistance!
@abrekize what are u talking about??? whats atrocities???? You know nothing about Russia and what they did in Chechnay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! then stfu
Most suicide bombers  thought  the reward of killing &quot;infidels&quot; is 72 beautiful virgins  in heaven( Sunan Tarmizi). --The Prophet Muhammad (صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم) said: &quot;Every man who enters paradise shall be given 72 (seventy-two) houris; no matter at what age he had died, when he is admitted into paradise, he will become a thirty-year-old, and shall not age any further. A man in paradise shall be given virility equal to that of one hundred men.&quot; [Tirmizi, vol. 2 states on page 138]
after 911 i think the governments stage all these events!! sorry i dont have much faith in the governments of the world!! they are all criminal in some way or another! just look into recent history! all the evidence is there that all govs do i lie and manipulate the people through deception!! this may be another one of those deceptions! 
high chance that is provocation
so 1 islam blow himself up and all islam been blame? u gotta to be kidding me..  how bout that 1 who did this.. is the same religion like u guys and wat u gonna blame? the religion or the people who did it.. 
you can&#39;t see shit about who detonated what, or exactly the origin of the blast. this is retarded. it&#39;s just as likely their was a gas leak or electrical shorting which led to that explosion, from all &#39;evidence you can see.&#39;
damn those islamic gas leaks! [ps: i&#39;m not claiming it was, just that from what you can see, it&#39;s equally valid as blaming &quot;OH NOES TEH TERRIERASTS R AFTER R LUCKY CHERMS!!!&quot;]
@clemnewyorker drink further , until you start making God of yourself.

вот пишешь.надо было сравнять с землей... я понимаю жалко людей.но этим проблемы не решишь.там тоже есть мирные и добрые люди.почитай историю.террористы всегда были и будут их не искоренить, как это не грустно, но это так!раньше они назывались асасинами а теперь шахиды, и жили на горе аламут(почитай интересно действительно)и пол европы в страхе держали на протяжении более 100 лет.бомбежкой ничего не решишь,только джахад сделаешь.и тогда война с Ираком, Ираном,Афганистаном и т.д.бред ты пишешь...
@neobulletproof Yeah, yeah, here is another know-it-all ready to put down a conspiracy explanation to all evils in the world. You don&#39;t need to cherry pick what is convenient for your own thesis. I said religions and ideals. Ideals include politic. Politic (including secret interests) caused the chechnya problems and any war in this planet. Religion just justified many of them. Fact.
@cecerchio This is not a religious war, dude! Most pple here are not exposed to world politics &amp; how it works! They start condemning someone who is suggested by the speculative Media. There is no proof of suiside bomber, don&#39;t point fingers to anyone or any religion. You don&#39;t realise that you are creating a Hatred among human beings. That&#39;s How and What exactly They want You to think and talk! It is a BIG GAME! Too big for u. People are just objects of their game to achieve their goal. CIA, FSB
НЕ НАДО БЫЛО ЦЕЛОВАТЬСЯ С АРАФАТОМ И ХАМАСОМ
Allahu Fuckbar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fuck religions. Fuck ideals. All of them. They cause all the problems, brainwashing fragile humans and killing innocents. Use your fucking brain and treat others as you are expected to be treated. We are in 2011 behaving like middle ages. Shame on you, humans.
@PeraSerb far from puken&#39;
NUCLEAR BOMB IN ALL REGIONS WHERE ARE TERRORIST, NOT ONLY IN THE CAUCASUS
Doesn&#39;t look like 5 kg of TNT
KA-PLOWIE:)
@Serbbre i dunno dude everything&#39;s possible... the thing is that... i as a romanian.. i trust a lot more fsb than other agencies.... im tellin ya... is one thing to be shot from the back and other to be shot from the front.... shoting from the back is not fsb style.... just my opinion... when such a colossus like fsb is involved then there is &quot;honor&quot; in the middle not a terrorist atempt.... anyway... semantics semantics... whats good or wrong... ehm... 
RIP
