Small mako shark?
This looks so fake
Clearley the shark as brains and thinks its a car and dosent goes past the stop sign good shark good boy
Just Run over the shark
Sharks don&#39;t move like that on the surface and there&#39;s no tail fin. How cold was the water and was it salt or fresh water?
That water isnt deep enough anyways..that one stop sign is hardly covered with water. A shark in 2 feet of water? Right
That’s my street! Wow.... I kinda wish we didn’t evacuate now!
I bet it&#39;s a bull shark
Nah...just a Tiburon out for a drive...
Everything is fake to you clowns until it swims up and bites you in the ass
Fake shit.
Fake asf the second dorsal fin would be out of the water to
I would be that one guy who had his window open asleep on his bed all a sudden the shark goes though the bedroom window and now I&#39;m fighting with a shark in my bed. Definitely would he the most random thing ever oh and while watching Jaws...
