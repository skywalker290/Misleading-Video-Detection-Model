Who gave likes to this bullshit...
It looked pretty believable until the hiding behind the tree part lol
Wtf
That bear was huge 😮
Fun fact about bears. They can smell blood from 1 mile away or more, so if a bear is chasing you, chances are they knew you&#39;d be there and chose you as food.
LMAO CGI bears clearly are slower than real ones and don&#39;t seem to make any noise!! WTAF how stupid do you think people are!!??

💻 CG?
что-то слабо верится
what a chance that there were hunters over there to help this guy at the worst time of his life.. Right before the first shot i was thinkin &quot;oh no what is he expecting from this tree, he s so done!&quot;
my name is john liam pidilla mr martin and make mar videyow
who is that idiot shooting in the forrest?
Well..after reading through the comments, I must admit: you did a very good job. I didn&#39;t realize it was CGI and even knowing, it&#39;s 95% real for me, despit the fact that he would have smelled you behind that tree lol..
Is the bear CGI?
Never abandon your bike if you dont have to! Pick your bike up hop on a keep riding, especially near a bear! It will catch you on foot
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK0pO79YkvY&amp;t=13">0:13</a> that moment when ur adrenaline rush to maximum lvl

This video is about as real as the T rex footage in Jurassic Park
grizzly was just saying hi!

Grizzly bears can run up 35mph. There is no way someone could out run one on a bike

Shocking. A bear 🐻 living in a forest.

Just like in a horror movie with the tree branch in way while the bear is just behind you.
I don&#39;t think we have grizzly in karpatian  mountains, we certainly have lot of bears though. Also , find strange there was someone in the woods all of sudden shooting bullets to the air to frighten the bear. Anyway great video having the gut to film this and put yourself into the danger 😅
Beware next time venture into the woods because would be waiting for you. <br>They know your scent and can smell you from parameters of the forest.😂😂😂

What a cute pet bear.  What a lot of work went into setting up the tent to get that shot.  But hey, some people were convinced.  The yelling wasn’t the best acting though, and the breathing should be heavier.  But the skit fooled many, so it worked!
This was NOT an attack.
That is the same bear that years later visited the same guy in his tent. I think it’s time for them to get married and live happily ever after 😉
Yea my ass that really happened
Looks CGI definitely

How is it you&#39;re always coming across bears for no reason?  Pfft!
Вот это идиот ,велосипед босил ,чудом жив остался
I get it. After reaching the fallen tree, the bear got stuck in the textures
this video not real....
Here we go again - more Clickbait about a bear attacking you… You need to get over yourself. <br><br>You don’t understand the difference between a bear attacking you versus a bear charging you. Those are completely different concepts.<br><br> I know it’s hard interacting with all these new ideas in your life – but it’s time to be real and stop blowing things out of proportion. This is no more a bear attacking you than your neighbors dog that’s barking at you is. <br><br>If you didn’t get even scratched or mauled, then I don’t see how you can even justify calling this a bear attack. Had that bear actually wanted to attack you, you wouldn’t have been able to even escape from it on your bike.
Stupid not to have bear spray
best coach
The editing is better and the quick reveal of the bear, makes it look more realistic, than your other video 8 years ago.
Damn Bear set a Trap
Какая же это тупая показуха медведь прямо испорться ещё не завалил палатку и не порвал тени и твою Жору ага расскажешь

This bear is fucking with you and got triggered by the fact you’re making a runner. They can easily speed up over 50 km/h over a short distance.
Don&#39;t turn back when ur going that fast because you might get fall down on that sand road

Wow that was crazy! … My mom recently had an encounter with a big black bear. He or she was napping under our deck. She was cleaning up around the yard and heard a grunt or a huff. She looked around and then went to look under the deck. She came face to face with the bear… then said “Oh sh**” and slowly backed away. Anyway, THIS bear never moved. She said he or she must’ve been too comfortable. 😉

This is almost as scary as the fact that the earth is actually flat, we&#39;ve never been to the moon and America is really Egypt and the Mississippi River is actually the Nile River aka the Euphrates River lol. Oh and the Devil&#39;s Tower in Wyoming is really a giant&#39;s foot loaded with gold and pyramids are really giant&#39;s feet loaded with gold and all along the Mississippi River uh, I mean the Nile River aka the Euphrates River used to be many pyramids that have been taken down. Tons of gold up an down them. Insane how much gold is actually in the United States lolol

The hunters should have their own call sign like batman. Something like a gun with diamond in the back.
If I were the bear I&#39;d take the bicycle and keep chasing the man
i would have bunny hopped that tree no problem, and continued to pedal my ass off!!! got to have been the scariest chase ever!
when you hid behind the tree the bear would probaly see the bike and walk closer to you and when i saw it we can all agree that it is CGI
Absolutely terrifying.
Bro you should&#39;ve fought it like dicraprio in revenant. 😂
You’re lucky it was down hill!

Is that freddy fazbear? Har har har
Ending: He just wanted his bike
Главное не свалиться....

Could he have gone around the branch and stayed on the bike?? Anyone else thinking this?
Actually bear wants to ride his bicycle but he refused and then ran away
An exact temple run 😮

Kacee is the prettiest
The light source doesn&#39;t match

Dang. The bear chased him through so much of speed on bicycle but couldn&#39;t figure out he was hiding behind a tree and not even smell him. Damn, that&#39;s one dumb bear.

Ya should’ve had a 454 Casul
Out of all places .. At such a time when there’s a life and death situation..a branch is in the middle of the path 🤦🏾‍♂️ The anxiety from watching that part is crazy
Does this man run away to avoid attacking the bear? Which means, he will attack the bear if he don&#39;t run away from it? The problem with English is this.<br><br>Why don&#39;t you say &quot;run away from an offensive bear.&quot;
This is why one should always have bear mace
🥵
boring..!!!!!!
A real bear would have smelled him a mile away.
is that freddy fazbear
The lighting on the bear doesn’t match the lighting in the video…
Seek chase be like;
who put that fuckin&#39; tree in the road??😂
He should have had a burly Russian guy pop out from behind one of the trees and start wrestling the bear.
it can be seen that this is a montage😂
😂😂
Крути педали, пока пизды не дали
Я думал такие предательские коряги на дороге только в кино бывают.
Slow the video down to %25 in your settings - you can see the different textures and digital format of the bear … it’s edited for sure. Look a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK0pO79YkvY&amp;t=12">0:12</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK0pO79YkvY&amp;t=13">0:13</a> .. you can see the , “bear’s” feet/paws line up and shift in the direction of the camera like it’s on ice … it was video edited
I was scared for you 😭
Pause the video at 35 seconds and you’ll realize you’re the “bright” one.
har har harhar har har harhar harhar
O cholera czy to freddy fazbear
<b>Some days it’s hard find</b> <b>motivation…… other days</b> <b>motivation finds you!</b>
That makes him a sprint champ!
Bear: come here you
Nice edit
pls remake now with generation ai, will fool another 40million people
That was a rare escape, God saved him, the man must’ve been terrified, not knowing if the road would be open, finding a tree blocking the path, having to hide in a fairly open area, with a hungry grizzly and its incredible nose in hot pursuit.  I honestly don’t know why people go hiking and cycling in their territory like that.
The bear has his bike now.
Медведь хорошо отыграл свою роль👍
Bear video on the internet I died watching it ffs. Wow!
The cgi is amazing ngl
How to escape a bear: Hide behind a tree even if it&#39;s skinny it won&#39;t matter because the bear wouldn&#39;t hear you.
bear has no motion blur lmao
What a chase, I hope you are ok ! 😮
Дорога, не кончайся пожалуйста!
That very moment when you kick yourself in the ass for not buying an E bike
O cholera czy to freddy fazber?
bear can run 30mph, so it could have killed the rider. it was just enjoying chase.
А если цепь слетит с велоса?)😂
<b>Legend has it that the bear is still trying to catch up to the man to let him know he dropped his wallet to this very day</b>
That bear is dumfounded. Where did this human disappear to? 🤔
I&#39;m constantly searching to be as lucky as this guy. I found a video explaining what to do in a bear attack. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjCyEAOwBjA">https://youtu.be/RjCyEAOwBjA</a>
When he stopped at the branch I thought it was over
Guys is this Freddie fazbear ar ar ar
Той то курва має фарта
The bear was also fearing for his life and unfortunately he might haven&#39;t had the same fortune to be alive.
У медведя видимо был свой интерес, обгонит он велосипед или нет, спортивные соревнования😄
Imagine if he turned back, the bear was riding a bicycle too
The bear actually directed and starred in this film - and did a very creditable job.
New FNAF game looks too realistic!🤯🤯🤯
Bear speed 120😂😂
This was a Great Intro Trailer for Far Cry 7
The bear definitely aint real. Its too slow, and floaty? I guess, its not really going with gravity is what I mean.
The day wished bike had that ET capability
Where is that video from?
That was so intense watching this, man peddling for his life to get away from the grizzly bear 🚴🐻.
Thank God someone else had a gun! 😂 jeez
Fucking car insurance bear
Remember to learn how to do bike-jumps. Noted
CGI
Clickbait.   Report the video as &quot;misinformation&quot;- let&#39;s get this guy banned.
My God, that man is lucky to be alive. He shouldn’t have tried to run from the bear - that signals to the bear that you are prey
Anyone here in 2023
Bear was like, “Where’d you go Potter!?”
انا لله أودا حمد 😅😅😅
Grizzly bears can outrun a galloping horse.  I don&#39;t see any way that this guy could have outrun a bear if it was really after him.
bad montage
liar.

C&#39;mon man, the bear just wanted his bicycle
Какой, на хрен, мужчина !))) Пиздюк пытается убежать от несуществующего медведя !👱🚴🐻👈🤣
Good montage
Für mich ist das davon fahren nicht laufen du hirni
Bear probably said to his friend. Hold my beer and watch this 😅
fun fact : bears have great sense of smell , even better than blood hounds . That hiding behind a tree so close to trail is literally an invitation to dinner.
Photo shop
Yes, this is much more interesting than the Tour de France.
Faker than my ex wife&#39;s t**s she bought with my money.

It was going down his legs ! 😆
Is this real?
У меня со словом аттака ничего кроме титанов ее ассоциируется,якие медведи
死にかけとるがな！😦
If the bear wanted his arse it would have had it, they can run at 35 mph.  You have to be intellectually challenged ride a bicycle on forest roads without a gun.
Съел тебя медведь?
It is advisable to avoid triggering the predator/prey instincts of a bear. Instead, one should maintain a neutral stance and hold their ground. In the event that the bear advances, defensive measures such as the use of firearms may be necessary.
People love CGI bears
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I am sorry for using your video. I’m new at this tell you the truth. I didn’t know I had to have permission. But I’m trying to do the right thing. Can I please get your permission to use your video thank you.
If that bear had really wanted to catch him he would have. Would never have had time to glance behind .
reason why I always carry a magnum revolver or a 10 mm
My pants would be full.
I bet his legs have never pedalled so fast 😅
Наверное медведю был нужен велосипед 🤣
Omg😱
As you can see, if you look in the trans script, he will say he added the bear in the editing phase

Plot twist the bear is his trainer ensuring that the cyclist doesnt slack off on his run.
Фотомонтаж... Позорище
I think the bear was over exposed in the composition.<br>Dial it down a bit, it will look more realistic
Puedo sentir el miedo en su respiración
Let’s be honest. We all know the bear wasn’t serious lol.
Who put the tree block on the middle of the road???

Man, you&#39;re just lucky it wasn&#39;t on cocain.

Forse l&#39;orso non era aggressivo, voleva rubarti la bicicletta.
E se l&#39;orso incontrasse Chuck Norris? 😂
Actually, pretty good. The camera blur matches and there&#39;s good roto to put it behind the tree. The lack of shadow isn&#39;t even that troublesome, given that it&#39;s an overcast day. The biggest problem is a compositing issue: the shadows of the bear are darker and more saturated than the plate. It just needs a bit of color adjustment.
Now that’s what I call a workout, stay hard😂😂😂😂
Крути педали пока не догнали!
Fraudster
nice photoshopping
At least you could have taken the time and matched the lighting...
acojonante....
Might want work on color correction, getting framerates matched, same resolution, and giving the bear some sort of shadow so it doesnt look like different footage just playing over it
cgi btw

You didn&#39;t get the point of this video. This bear was from the circus. Never steal a bike from a bear.
The whole thing is scripted and that grizzly is special effects.

the legend is that the bear sold this bike on eBay to the same guy the left there on the forest.............great CGI, btw..........🤣
Disney quality CGI bear still slower than bike.
どう観ても合成だねこれ。
worst cgi ive seen in a long time
“Sir…. you dropped your wallet”
Nice edit😂😂
Looks more like Skyrim
Looks real to me..didnt waste no time getting off bike and running.
And remember, friends, try not to cross paths with a bear, and less if it is hungry, because in terms of food, he makes a whole menu
Why doesn’t the bear ever win?
No masz szczęście że udało ci się uciec dobrze że myśliwi interweniowali dobra robota :)
I mean, if that is what you need to inspire you to give 100% in a workout, then good on you.
wasn&#39;t that just a big cat?
I used to like when TV was for science fiction and internet clips were real. Roles are reversing.
b.S
If you look closely, then you will see that the bear doesn&#39;t even have a shadow, so its 100% clear that its edited lol
Why　did he turn right?
拍影片的人，還健康平安無事嗎？
Wow, incredible.. You are one brave soul for going through this..
Looks so real 😂<br>Not
the scariest part was when the bear started to hunt the guy down.
The bear had a go pro aswell
truly awful vfx, artist should be ashamed
what attack?
I will never give up my human advantages. Bear spray, high-power gun and an e bike with a top speed of 60mph. If my bike runs out of battery life it would be unfortunate for the bear. I even keep a 45 side arm just in case I don&#39;t have time to play around 😊

He bearly escaped

How did he film the bear behind him while he was holding the bike handles with both hands?<br><br>And his hands didn&#39;t have any camera.
the bear is in 4k and footage is in 720p
まじで怖すぎ。<br>しかも道じゃないところに隠れるなんて大丈夫なん？<br>その後気になるわ。
Bro, what if another bear sitting on the road suddenly? what will he do then?😂😂😂Only 💀💀💀
this would make a great concept for a live streaming channel or reality TV game show, especially if they don&#39;t always get away 🙄
Wow
Lucky his shirts was green omg
Best training :D
А чё вы медведю недали велосипед,, поэтому он и хотел его сам отобрать,, ведь все знают что это его любимый вид транспорта!!..
Fun fact, brown bears can run up to 35 mph. Lance Armstrong in his fastest ever sustained pace rode at 28 mph.

Bears have the stamina &amp; power to chase a moose for 10 mins. This didn&#39;t convince me that it was real, but, dude is looking for views, not factual reality.....
How fast this big bear is
That&#39;s a bear trap.
I can feel the lung burn and jelly legs just watching 😂
That f ing branch HAD to be there.
He&#39;s lucky it was down hill
Well good luck in real Life play hide and seek whit bear..🤪🤌 hopea The wind IS storming and u r under The wind compares to bear..🎉
I can’t believe ppl though this shi was real 😂
合成下手杉
Bruh i was wondering how the bear was keeping up with this guy so i did some research. And apparently grizzly bears are the fastest of bear species and can reach speeds of 35 mph. Apparently we can outrun in terms of distance but in terms of actually outrunning in speed they would def catch up to us in no time. Unless you are usain bolt and can keep up sprinting for that long. And if you think about climbing trees apparently they can do that better than us too. So basically unless you could  scare them off you are fucked like this guy was if those shorts werent fired.
え、枝？（絶望）

U see a charging bear first time <br><br>.and no sounds come out from you

It is a good thing that bears famously cannot smell or hear, otherwise this bear would have easily found the guy behind that tree.

У меня аж дух захватило. Медведь-очень опасен!
Bro unlocked bicycle in temple run.
Скорость медведя 50 км/ч. Скорость велозвиздабола 40, км/ч. Медведь не хотел догнать велосипедиста. Он заблудился и искал дорогу домой.

Someone put that branch across the road as if knew some day some bicyclist will be running away from a bear
Oh my goodness. Scary.

Так быстро он ещё не ехал в своей жизни
knew it. too much captain disillusion episodes have i watched hahaha

This is why you don’t go biking, hiking or camping in the wilderness without a gun.
That’s great I just shit myself watching this video. 😮😮😮😮😮
I think thats a grizzly bear
Nice edit

A bear that is hunting can reach speeds of about 56k/h.
Io mi sono cagato sotto solo nel non vedere continuamente l&#39;orso dov&#39;era...
Велосипедист явно понимает психологию поведения медведя, ведь четко все сделал, просто красавчик, вот это холоднокровие!
NO WAY THIS IS REAL
This is CGI innit? just pointing out what people are saying.
That’d be crazy if a bear started coming from the front too.
何処の国の熊も時速30~から60キロらしいね〜<br>映像を撮ってた人も本当に怪我なく無傷で助かって良かった。<br>熊と出会ったら逃げずに黙って立っていろと言うけど、全力で逃げたいほどデカい熊だった…

Work on your light blending bud. Editing not too bad otherwise. Also for your reference: grizzly bears can run 35 miles an hour. Even Usain Bolt on a bicycle would not escape 😊

Schade das der bär den Typ nich gekillt hat. Überall treiben sich diese fahrradpenner rum, aber immer zuerst den Bären umlegen der ja nur in seinem Lebensraum lebt🤮🤮🤮
Utter bollocks
According to the Italian translation the man is trying to avoid attacking the bear. So we must say there are dangerous animals in the wood: humans. And bears are in danger! :)
Туфта
American stupid movie 🖕
OMG I got goosebumps all over me😅
How many megapixels was this bear?  Usually that determines their computer generated strength
Bear looked like a shiny version of a grizzly bear lol
Good CGI 😮.
I have no doubt this guy wanted this to happen so he could get all those views. What this actually means is he has risked this bears life in the future by getting it habituated to humans. This happens all the time and it is a shame. Any encounter can cause that, which leads to animals being killed by humans either on the road or shot by police/park rangers. Sure you can stumble upon a bear trail riding or hiking, that’s different. This guy definitely wanted this encounter though. It isn’t one of those cases where you always leave the house with a camera rolling to capture things like this. No, this guy went into an area that was probably prohibited or at least posted with warning signs of bear activity in area and he got exactly what he wanted and people are bewildered thinking this is amazing. This bear will probably die from a human one day. It’s what happens. Know the facts. And then I see comments here trying to be funny and not seeing the bigger picture. The ignorance for the survival of wildlife is a shame we’re the most intelligent animals on the planet and some of you can’t see what’s wrong with this video
Thank god he was in a downhill
Shittyest thumbnail.... ever. Good job dumb fuck.
f whoever put the branch there
NOTE TO SELF<br>NEVER PINCH A BEARS BIKE!
But that’s a biker…

The bear probably wasn’t running full force. Bears can run at up to 50 km/h so unless you’re going downhill, it’s unlikely that you could outrun a bear on a bike.

So you just decide to go for a bike ride and all the sudden there’s a Bear. Then you get off your bike because of what’s laying in the road/trail and run 🤣
😳💀💀😕 omg boy his heart was racing
If Freddy fazbear escaped the pizzareia:
Play it at 0,25 speed
OMG THATS A BEAR!
You are lucky and blessed - it would have caught and eaten you. The branch blocking the trail and the gunshots saved you.
Ma si può essere così stupidi ?
😮😮😮😮
i love it
That gunshot saved your life!!!
Ma che stracazzo fai, lasci la bici li perché c’è un ramo ? Ma scherzi o che? Se non fosse stato per quello sparo se lo sarebbe pappato in un secondo, che gente idiota vive su sto mondo
Omg the anxiety is unbearable 😮
Okay... whos Shooting in the background... maybe its a Bastard Move?

That bear was faker than the drawer under the sink!
It was a Berenstein bear
This isn&#39;t a joke, it is hazardous to deal with this.
This is what it looks like when you play hide and seek with a bear.
Okay that bear looked SO real like I actually thought you were being chased by one.
That was an escaped circus bear having a flashback. He stole my bike!!

How in the fuk did there happen to be another random guy shoot the bear perfect time 😂 his luck is 90000

Unreal... no literally. This bear isn&#39;t real.
Ой ! Ой ! Страх то какой 🤯🤯
Who would have bunny hopped over that branch?
Now thts motivation
Bruh he was just trying to tell you something
la velocità massima di un orso è di 40-50 km allora, mentre una MTB in pianura se sei molto forte puoi arrivare a 60 km allora circa, quindi se corri veloce riesci a scappare. tuttavia nel video hai fatto un grosso errore hai abbandonato la tua bici per terra scappando a piedi.......mai scappare a piedi, un essere umano può arrivare a 30 km allora correndo quindi contro un orso è impossibile scappare via.<br>  il mio consiglio devi imparare a saltare con la bici, se sapevi saltare potevi passare il tronco di albero rotto per terra.<br> Comunque ci sono dei video che spiegano come saltare con la bici, il salto si chiama  &quot;BUNNY HOP&quot;, in genere si fa con la bmx perche è piu leggera, ma puoi adattare quel tipo di salto ad una MTB....la MTB nei boschi è piu consigliata con le marce arrivi a 50-60 allora di velocità, mentre una BMX avendo una sola velocità arrivi a 45 km allora quindi è piu difficile scappare via da un orso anche se comunque sia ce sempre la possibilita di cavarsela.<br> ringrazia Dio che ti sei salvato, ringrazia i cacciatori che hanno spaventato l&#39;orso.
CGI
マジで怖すぎ
The CGI here is very impressive.
Level of legitness: 2 million
Hope the lad got away in the end.
get better at adjusting the lighting on your video edits...that bear looks so obviously cut out its hilarious people think it is real
Play it in .5x you can see it’s edited well

Медведь увидел быстро едущий велосипед, и у него инстинкт преследования сработал. Так же и собака могла броситься следом.

А сзади за велосипедистом вырастает кирпичная стена... Кстати у великой китайской возможно подобная история...🙄🤔🤔
This man refused to be like Leo DiCaprio lmfao 🤣
Dumb  video<br> The attack was so bad I can&#39;t believe you survived.  All the bites and scrapes must have been terrible
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK0pO79YkvY&amp;t=71">1:11</a> the beer seems to have a rope around its neck. Could it be a cgi?
So did he get eaten where&#39;s the rest of the video

Наверное Мишке он был не очень нужен. Миша погонял его для удовольствия, что бы не забывал, кто в лесу хозяин. Для справки, потапыч лошать на коротком рывке догонит.
