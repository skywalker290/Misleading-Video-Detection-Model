Us cubans we have a heart of steel
Folded his ass.
lol
I wonder what he was thinking in the very last moment
Dying over weed, shameful on the police.
What an idiot. I feel bad for the cops in this one. I mean it is a weed grow house so kinda dumb, but the cops weren&#39;t being violent actually very much the opposite just wanted to get him and do their job. Actions like that I&#39;m not feeling too sorry he&#39;s dead. Kind of asked for it. Should have just <br><br>A. Hid in the car and see IF they find him. <br><br>B. Just surrender and keep your life, or at least don&#39;t take anyone else with you if you decide to go.
brave guy...he just wanna help for the other guy who have been arrested by the police...
True warrior
Like in what mind do you start shooting at the police? INSANE!
All Over some herbs‚Ä¶
Is it just me or are both the bad guys in the same outfit?
TAKE VIDEO DOWN IF YOU ARE GOING TO RESTRICT IT1111111111
That&#39;s what you get for being so tough STUPID IDIOT now look at you DEADü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Yo he went out like a G tho
All this is the name of cannabis. War on drugs is a terrible joke.
That&#39;s one big headache at end.
If you‚Äôre going to be a suspect for a career, make sure you take how shoot a fire 101 classes. Aim for the head, officer have vest of for a reason, neck or head.
Tell me this wasn&#39;t over pot
These guys don&#39;t even really look like cops, they look like gangsters who bought some law enforcement swag online and was going to rob this place. This don&#39;t look like a normal drug raid that I&#39;ve ever seen.<br>This looks a little sketchy.
YEA WELL LIFE AINT WORTH LIVING IF YOU CANT BE FREE EVEN TO GROW SOME WEED FFS KILLED FOR GROWING SOME WEED ...
Wasn&#39;t very smart but he had ball&#39;s
estos viejitos cubanos eran locos,no se quitan ni estando viejos ya
Headshot! He gone!
What a dumbass
Sniper got his ass
This is why police fire hella times and ppl bkcyh about it, cause if the cop just kept shooting instead of thinking they guy was done then he wouldn&#39;t of got shot

cops murdering people OVER A PLANT
Pepsi?
Good shot
Did the officer survive?
Nosy cops shouldnt had been invading someones privacy/property!
He showed those cunts something on his way out, RIP blue plaid shirt the OG
I think I&#39;ll have a shootout with 3 armed cops.....WTF? IDIOT.
Did he get the one tho?
Extra points for headshot
All to protect 80 pounds of marijuana....
cops killing people over plants... WAKE UP AMERICA. POLICE ARE THE REAL TERRORIST&#39;S.
&quot;TREE HUGGER&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=74">1:14</a> bro hit the griddy
Head shot with pink mist
Whoever was doing the servellience needs a new spot on the team someone clearly should‚Äôve spotted that guy in the car n could‚Äôve been stopped before all this happened
That last headshot between the trees was crazy
Those who live by the sword,....
all for marijuana,,, stupid &#39;&#39; laws&#39;&#39; wrecked our country
If he had been smart and started shooting right off the bat he might of taken all 3 of them out. He had the drop on them with their guns holstered.
Pipo el flaco too them billets like a champ!
It‚Äôs crazy to me to see cops killing people for just growing a harmless plant, meanwhile you have the government and big pharmaceutical pushing pills that kill tens of thousands of people a year. Guess they really don‚Äôt like the competition. I mean imagine how nice it must be to be a drug dealer that is legally allowed to kill or imprison all your competitors.
Considerably slowed down to show detail, this was a best watched @ 2.0x speed to show how quick gunfights occur
I understand that no cop wants to pull that trigger, although though situations like these, they have no choice. You got to take out the target to keep the peace in the streets.
Head shot
+200 points for headshot!!
I mean all he was gonna get was arrested bro really gave up life üß¨
Watching cops die is so satisfying to me
Fuken pussys when it&#39;s an even fight they run like bitches and even tho they were 3 vs 1...
Great job by the cops.Need much more of this type of housecleaning.
I don‚Äôt get it he shoots the coo twice in the leg and he dies. Terrible luck. This punk got shot in the leg, chest, side and head and he still moving.
Good - bad guy nice and dead !
I pressed confirm 4x... Well worth it
Miami
Lights out loser!
That man already save inside a car, then why he get out, maybe he think he was rambo or john wick ? Dumbazz üòÇüòÇ
It makes no sense that a criminal can acquire a firearm easier than they can obtain a drivers license. To put an end to straw man purchases, where someone buys a gun from a legal establishment on behalf of a criminal, there needs to be a national gun registry.
I guess that‚Äôs enough internet for now‚Ä¶
I don&#39;t normally like to watch someone bleed.  But......
Mf got scalped
Nice headshot
Did the cop die?
He got a clone for a bodyguard
Shoutout to the officer with the mean precision of hitting him in the head through the tree
Man they popped that melon
Anyone notice that there wearing the same exact thing like the one guy was a decoy kinda seem like they knew they was coming
Serves him right
Hope no officers were seriously injured here n the dude that shot at em took his last breath on that driveway
Headshot. Mmmmm
Jesus loves you üôèüèΩ
why did i say <br><br><b>Headshot</b><br><br>in like a deep voice i forget if its from a video game or sum but i still said it when that officer domed that dude in the face
Growhouse as in weed?? Like there was a deadly shoot out on a residential street because of weed? Like people lost their lives over some weed??
Shout out to the cop that got the head shot through the gap in the tree üéØüòÇ
Nobody was hurt in the making of this film
A prayer for my best friend. If you watch closely he looked around, saw they were coming and prepared by going into the car. He had every chance to bail but followed through to the end no matter what the outcome. My delinquentes
I got 6 graphic content warnings ,that&#39;s the most I&#39;ve ever gotten !!! I hope this doesn&#39;t scare me too bad
that dude had no fear wow. and police trying to arrest ppl for a plant has got to stop. the cop wouldn&#39;t of been shot and this dude wouldn&#39;t of lost his life IF THEY JUST STOP ARRESTING PEOPLE OVER A PLANT. meanwhile the cops are on legal meth and opiates
And to think weed is legal
That 5% doing it‚Äôs job
Ngl I could see how they don‚Äôt look like cops at first seeing as the jump outta dam Altima but don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs yhe case
I like the part where he&#39;s dancing on the tree and gets shot in the nugget

Why didn&#39;t they check the vehicle when approaching the property?
These guys twins?????
Homeboy wasn‚Äôt let his homie go like that
It&#39;s just weed... government Nazi got what they deserved.
what a mess!
1.41 damn
The only good criminal is one riddled with bullets lol
Rip homie
Went out like a gangster!!
It‚Äôs fuckin weed why you pulling out gats in coconut grove just take the charge.
All this over growing plants?.... Plants. Our country is so f&#39;d up.
Dude was a warrior lol, still put up a fight.
This people died for nothing
See. . . Now you don&#39;t have a face!   And. . . You&#39;re dead!
If I clicked confirmed the first time what makes you think I&#39;d change my mind the 5th?!
This all happened because some dusty old politicians decided to make a plant illegal a long time ago. Can&#39;t say I feel sorry for cops who go around incarcerating people for growing and smoking plants.
Headshot
Over a growhouse smh. Dude would probably be outta jail by now if he took the charge
for weed?
Should‚Äôve got out &amp; put shot on Target üéØ inside of flashing &amp; giving time to respond‚ÄºÔ∏è
What a good headshot
People got to understand Florida man it may seem like it&#39;s like super free down there and the governor doesn&#39;t care about nothing and this and that but they got some harsh f*<b>***</b> penalties you get caught doing something you go down for a while these dudes were part of a grow house operation probably in the cartel or something they knew it was over with they knew that they would probably get killed in prison by the cartel or whatever they knew it had to go down like that you got to remember gangsters or gangsters for a reason bro they&#39;re not going to puss out at the end except for the one dude that got thrown on the ground at the end but yeah
Boi like a spaghetti western right their
cop had  good aim and shot the suspect in between the branches on that tree.
Lol  that cop just walked to the a d let the suspect pass him, the black k cop stopped the white man, that&#39;s what happens  when you treat races differently  you get killed by your own
Granny went out blowing
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=101">1:41</a> that‚Äôs some head shot from the guy at the back of the red pickup .
If cops arrive even one second earlier they see homie dipping into the car.
Anybody else agreed 4 times before the video started
Dummy could have stayed in the car dumbass
Play stupid games get stupid gifts that guy got what he deserved
Cops are so pathetically trained
All because they just wanted to grow weed. The police are murderers man.
Goodnight
Dude could have been gone, ended up a goner.
I liked seeing all the blood come out of the criminal as he leaked to death.
He had a action movie death fall
Over marijuana.  Just Ridiculous.
And they went in with just 3 cops? Strange on its own.. if they had a search warrant there would be alot more.
If he really wanted to surprise cops and kill them he should of cracked the drivers window down and just blasted everyone. I don&#39;t understand why he got out, pointed a gun and cops, studdered around then wait for the 1 cop to pull his weapon then have a shoot out. Dumb. Luckily for these cops he didn&#39;t. And his boy lucky his goofy ass didn&#39;t accidentally shot him too.
Since when weed growers become violent ppl? Damn, the odds he closes his car door just before they run up its nuts! Probably should of cleared the car? Wild.
Whats wrong w people that&#39;s suicide, never do such thing or better stay away from a gun.<br>If you don&#39;t have one, this will never happen to you
I‚Äôm sorry this shut funny asl
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=101">1:41</a> headshot
I&#39;m not sure but, I think the guy who got out of the Red truck and ran around it. Got hit by the car
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=100">1:40</a>... The bubble got popped through the tree... üëÄüëÄüëÄ
Damn this video made me confirm 3 times u kn it&#39;s gota b good
I would‚Äôve stayed in the car they would‚Äôve never knew
The shooter should have atleast taken a cop with him smh
Those people looks like they were at home !!!!üòûüòûüòûüòûüòû
What makes anyone think it&#39;s a good idea to draw down on law enforcement...that man must have wanted to die
The head shot did not kill him instantly
He went night night
merica
Lol
Now its a grave house
thats how you smoke a pig?
Hats off with respect to the fallen.   The guy was willing to die to stop his brother or friend from going to jail.    No disrespect to officers im just saying     i know if my family or good friend was fighting the law id join in on the fight.    Not all police are good this has been prooven over many times
Well he went down in a blaze of unglory.
Dude has a death wish to try ambushing three cops with nothing but a tree to hide behind after starting. Element of surprise is pretty much nonexistent with that many eyes looking for someone acting stupid.
That viejo was a real ride or die gangsta
Those cops are lucky none of them were killed after not noticing him in the car. Had the victim just put down the window quietly and fired, the outcome could&#39;ve been much worse.
Goofy ah shoot out
Bruh I‚Äôm wheezing. It‚Äôs hilarious when they do the snow angel stuff in their final moment üòÇ
The rag doll physics tho üòÇ ü§£
Shot in face? What was that
I see a lot of random shooting on behalf of the Miami P.D. Use the gun range and leave the doughnuts at home fat bastards!
Bad police training
All I know is that‚Äôs one less evil in the world that we have to worry about. What a great way to snuff out his flame
Claim no bulletsüõêüõêüõê
Man died a legend
Then the police take the weed and sell it for profit! See Obstruction of Justice documentary. This government sells coke and dope. Kills anyone who talks
Unit f ed up....person 1 wasn&#39;t controlled and breached arrest...team could&#39;ve easily got taken out by 1 man...
‚ÄúGrowhouse?‚Äù As in plants? Please tell me police didn‚Äôt kill people over plants?
Head shot between tree. Crazy
Damn
whys ur friend ready to die for you for no reason it seems like tf weird
He should&#39;ve just stayed in the car &amp;&amp; played it cool But nawl he rather jump out &amp;&amp; play a role from the wild wild west instead &amp;&amp; Unfortunately for him the cost was extremely exorbitantü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
all this over plants. wow
wait...this was about weed? such heroism.
Wooowwww
It&#39;s a job he knew the risk cop shot first and everything
Wish there was sound
Had shot #4 finally got him down !
That white boy wouldn‚Äôt go down ! How many holes in him and he‚ÄôsSTILL standing ? Damn..!
üëèüòÜ
What a shot! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=102">1:42</a> from the back of red pick up headshot through tiny gap in tree
Love how In the end the dude walks past his dying homie like damn u risked ur life for me that‚Äôs sucks have fun in the afterlife.
God is evil

God is not dead! He is just the exact opposite of what we pray for!!

If you are a so called fire armes instructor your a f$<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23king">#king</a> RETARD...the police had every right to peel that guy&#39;s cap after being shot at and one of there fellow officer&#39;s was shot at dam near point blank...i&#39;ll be sure not to sign up for your class if That&#39;s what you teach...just sayin...
This is why undercover officers should not initiate operations like this, i don‚Äôt think the guy who shot at the undercover officers was consequently aware of the situation. Think about it you get in your car and when you look up you see 3 guys in plain clothes wearing vests that say ‚Äúpolice‚Äù grabbing on your friend/partner. Last time i checked you can buy those on the internet. Not to mention they pulled up in an unmarked sedan.
Got his top blown back
That last head shot was sweet
Cop died over weed .. how dumb
I hope you enjoyed it buddy
You know it&#39;s serious when YouTube makes you confirm your age 3 times hahaha
Shooting people over a plantü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Me, I‚Äôm quietly locking the door, and reclining the seat. Maybe they don‚Äôt notice. I‚Äôm not getting in shootout with cops over pot.
Hey, wait a minute‚Ä¶ I thought this only happened to minorities???
Damn grandpa came out blasting! üò≥
Nice plug into his useless brain..
That headshot was bad ass.
Don&#39;t arrest people for growing plants, that is immoral. As a cop I could not morally arrest another human for marijuana. It just doesn&#39;t click with me. They were defending their freedom.
Hard to imagine choosing to die for no good reason.
The streets are now a little safer for black men and boys.
In other words HEADSHOTüòà
Nowadays cops shoot people and let them die. But they took their fellow officer to get medical help so that&#39;s a plus I think. So it&#39;s just this way since the world started and the story will repeat itself. People help their own and screw the rest.Thats sad.
Did the suspect die?
Why did a cop pull up in a Altima tho
All I can say is DAMN THAT WAS SO STUPID to come out shooting on trained officers.
Over some weed?
You know its serious when it ask you over and over about graphic and keep hitting confirm
Why did the first cop turn and shoot at the other cop while fleeing toward the back of the house‚Ä¶he clearly looks see its a cop pulls his weapon down then picks it back up toward the cop closest to the street and fires. In the 2nd video you can see the bullet hit the grass. To the one commentor who says its his uncle‚Ä¶did he ever explain that
All this over growing weed yet let pedos out fast. Should been oter way around
And now its legal..what a joke cops are
ALL OVER SOME UNTAXED WEED ..<br>GOVERNMENT IS THE BIGGEST MOB
man had a hole in his back and still shot nd got faced üòÇ
America what wonderful country......
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=75">1:15</a> looks like he connected a shot to the corrupt officers! Congratulations
Man, I hope that person suffered horribly.
Lemons
Got hit with the ban üî®
Police are killers without emotions.
H-H-H-H-HEADSHOTTTTTT
lolü§¶üèø
24 warning buttons lmao
Police work in the States.
Meanwhile here in Maine, pot is a white-collar crime
My only question is why didn&#39;t they pull the guy out the car to clear him before running up
Gawd! These people. How does one come to the conclusion that pulling a gun on a cop is a good idea? It never ends well. Even if you don&#39;t get shot, you&#39;re going to prison for a much longer time than you were before you pulled the gun. I mean, what is the thought process here?
That officer who was shot did not place any stopping shots at such a close range, and he stood in the same spot with no cover and concealment after firing and failing to silence the threat. <br>Makes me think his department needs to train them better and put officers who do have the training in positions like that. Poor guy.
Head shot
2 victims of the meaningless war on drugs
That headshot was satisfyingüëç
Crazy white boyüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Pigs
This must be the most intense shooting footage on the net.
It&#39;s blurred
That head shot thru the tree <b>chefs kiss</b> RIP officer
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=208">3:28</a> aaaannndddd‚Ä¶he gone
I was shot in 2005. I don&#39;t remember anything. Then I woke up out of a coma 18 days later. I went to a convenient store. Two stores down was a liquor store. When I came out the convenient store.  Everything was caught on camera. That&#39;s how I know. As I walked out. Two men were standing in front of the liquor store. They followed me. My sister saw the video.  I never did. She told me as I reached to my car. I turned around. As if they asked me something. They pulled out a gun. I dropped my bags and put my hands up.  Let them take whatever they wanted to as I laid on my stomach.  After they took my wallet. One of the suspect shot me twice. I got up trying to walk to the convenient store for help.  I took two steps and collapsed. Suspects were never caught
Was he trying to clutch up a 3v1 but he failed
He came out with a gun like if they were going to sit and talk , you live by the sword you die by the sword
FIND WHO KILLED MY SISTER NOW!! OF COURSE THE CRIME SCENE IS COLD AND TOTALLY CONTAMINATED HOWEVER FIND HER KILLER NOW OR JUST COME PICK ME UP NOW ..THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I&#39;LL WORK FOR Y&#39;ALL I WANT ALL SURVEILLANCE CAMERA FOOTAGE FROM THE TIME SHE WAS ADMITTED TO  THE TIME SHE LEFT<br>.NOW!!
Dude took over 7 shots and a headshot and still didn‚Äôt die Immediately damnüòÇ
Dude should have just stayed in the car police didn&#39;t even see him.
You got to ask yourself man is all that worth it is whatever crime that was committed worth all of that happening? I got to say I seriously doubt it I don&#39;t even really know what happened more than likely there was something real stupid
Look like a movie scene
That headshot put him out
Next time get a better shot at them fukn pigz
Dont understand why the guy in the BMW started shooting.  You got to know when the gig is up.
That cop shooting behind him blindly should be fired on the spot.
we need more people to stand up against the polie and shoot at them
All shootings happen because someone doesn‚Äôt take into account they‚Äôll end up dead no matter the outcome
Simple dont point at a cop
This was over weed? Wtf.
He smoking a cigarette outside  he‚Äôs like ahhh today‚Äôs gonna be a good day :)
Sad regardless they was just trying to eat the only way they knew how
Two dudes in plaid with dognapper hats?
Horrible approach by the ‚Äú police ‚Äú RIP the victim.
Dam pot junkies should have known better than to set up shop in a nice looking neighborhood like that one.
He gonnnnnnnn!!
Over some weed?!? Goddamn. Legalize it.
What an amazing shot actually though one tap to the head
Dude could‚Äôve EASILY smoked 2 cops by rolling down his window, idk what the situation was but this show he was really in his corner!
Shitty job by cops whoever that officer was just know your the reason your partner was shot because you didnt clear the car like a dumb ass
Tyrant police familys should be ashamed
I‚Äôm just amazed the police walked up to the house in such a careless fashion without clearing those cars first. I thought the house was under surveillance and they would have seen the first guy getting in the car.
Straight soldier
Nice headshot by the cop.
Wow, YouTube warned me 3 times
I hope one day we have camps for these cops and we beat them
IM SORRY WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THAT AMAZING HEADSHOT
Well, that was a dumbass choice to make!!
That‚Äôs crazy. I would have stayed in the car and hid under the dashboard. I don‚Äôt think the cops even knew he was in there. Engaging the police in a shootout with a pea shooter could only end one way. He bled out right where he fell. What an awful way to go.
Dummy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=176">2:56</a> Kill shot
This is what I think about liberals‚Äô feelings.
Awesome headshot in the tree split
Damn you can see he got shot right in the of the back too
Man that head shot !
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=100">1:40</a> Own that fraud LOLOLOL
Jesus loves you so much and dies for you so you can be forgiven and spend everlasting life in heaven with him. Ask him into your heart while you have time. God bless yall ‚ù§Ô∏è
legalize drugs...and more people live<br><br>It&#39;s absolutely stupid AF for anyone to be subjected to violence over marijuana...cops or businesses
Remarkable headshot. Simply spectacular.
He hit him with that fortnite pro quickscope 2000 üíÄ<br><br><br><br>All jokes asside i dont know why u shot at the cops but Rest In Peace üôè
Those cops probably shat a brick when old school&#39;s armed evil twin appeared out of nowhere blasting.
Don ramon siempre un heroe
Oooooh I member this one
he shot him off the head glitch
Satisfied
Cop said peek me
El que a hierro mata a hierro muere.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=70">1:10</a> did the officer the suspect was firing at have a malfunction with his pistol?
go out guns blazing, i guess its kill or be killed. I don&#39;t feel bad for police its what they signed up for.They are paid to risk everything everyday... In Los Angeles they don&#39;t deserve any respect. LAPD operates like a gang and smaller local PD&#39;s are shitbag racists like Carson PD, Hawthorne PD, Old White Long Beach PD and Every cop in south bay.
So many officers no one seen ass hole get in car whats up with surveillance people i guess  when its your turn  guess it your turn to go .
He should have just stayed in the car they hit his ass up im sure the officer that hit him with that headshot got a promotion
Cop had no movement. Video games ruined my brain
I remember seeing this on the news in elementary üòÇ
Guy by the tree is dead af lol
F*<b>***</b> wack cops all b*<b>****</b> nothing special go after the gangs in over town killing old men is better right?
i think he thought they were tobbers disguiesed as cops happn tooo fast
And now weed legal in Florida ,this was fa nothing, a shame people had to die
Nice work
What timing. The guy got in that BMW and closed the door at perfect timing. Cops didn&#39;t know he was in there.
That shoother has balls he died like a true sicario
AWESOME!!!......P.O.S. GOT IT RIGHT THRU HIS HEAD!!!!......LOL!!!!!!!!
Graphic? No one cares if a cop gets shot lol
dude risked it all for his bro, you can tell he was probably older too.
He had balls.... Tony Montana ballz ...mane
HEADSHOT
That was bad ass.
Dude got into his car seconds before the cops rolled up. They had no idea he was in the car until it was too late.  Bad timing, and a well placed tree.
All because the govt wasnt getting a slice of the cake
Does anybody know why a cop is shooting at cops? Going off of the videos title.
I&#39;m always amazed at idiots that just come out all guns blazing at cops, they really couldn&#39;t care less
Blitzed his assüòà
Yay
What&#39;s the story behind all this chaos.
I wonder what went wrong here why did they feel the need to start shooting at the police
Dude got a smoked
Did the officer survive???üò¢üò¢
Hippty hoppity get off my property
Domed
Just so everyone knows they show THIS on YouTube but not weed?
Dumbass was in a car could have bolted
Completely agree with the policy üëè
The guilty is the one  who gets a shot in the leg. He shots only whe he see the man with the gun.. And one of his partners  already saw him but hes not stupid he dosnt make a shoot. Until the leg one shoots cause hes scared for see a gun! Wtf! <br>Besides police coming in civilian cars... Nah anybody could get uniforms, guns, t shirts thats says &quot;police&quot;. <br>I wouldnt  trust neither. Until see some legal papers etc.
Your friend is being arrested and you want to rescue him. Do you..<br>A: Point your gun to scare away the cops. If you&#39;re lucky, they&#39;ve never seen a real gun before.<br>B: Have a point blank shootout against 3 guys, and win.<br>C: Become click bate so 3.6 million people can gawk at your suicide by cop.
He could&#39;ve just stayed hidden in n the car
Y por eso siempre asumes que hay m√°s de un criminal
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=172">2:52</a> you see him get hole in his back
That was a  one tuff  guy no joke all those bullets and a head shot took him out
All over some marijuana ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è what was it $700 worth? $2,000?? $5,000???
Ok if your walkn up to a bust like they did how many of you would have checked the cars I know I would have that shoot out kinda falls on the cops for lack of training if they would have at least looked in the windows of the automobiles that were in the driveway that shoot out might not have happened
Dope
He probably could&#39;ve got away had he&#39;d stayed in the car.
Police always shot the suspect when he gets cought he could of tased him
Give him a medal for that headshot
Oh well
Fucc them cops
Wicked headshot. 10/10
Looks like he was trying to be Tony Montana but got hit so many times he was spinning around the tree.
Mail this video to the family <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23headshot">#Headshot</a>.
Went out like tru OG
They really didnt see homie get in the car? They just acted like noone was there the way the pulled up you would think they were watching the house should‚Äôve already had a draw on him and pulled him out of the car and put him on his face
Tony Montana handling business üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This is sad af
Clean head shot
As fucked as that guy is you gotta kinda respect that he went out firing for his boy.
IF THAT GUY LAYING THERE ON THE GROUND WAS BLACK THEY WOULD HAVE LOOTED THE WHOLE CITY
Don‚Äôt pull ur gun unless u ready to use right away
Beautiful
There is a saying &quot;take the shot&quot; that officer definitely took the shot when he poked his head through the tree
5 days left
Dude gave new meaning to being a &quot;tree hugger&quot;.
im no rocket scientist why the onk didnt take cover no comprende it looks like he wanted to be shot just standing there
Nice headshot
Jesus Christ Loves you Tremendously and died for all of our sinsü§ç‚úùÔ∏è<br>‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.‚Äù John 3:16
Illegaly go to a man&#39;s house with unmarked police gear an execute him only AMERICAüá∫üá∏ at its finest
To be fair if he had just stayed in the car they might have never noticed him...
This is just sad bro‚Ä¶
Did anybody else notice the Spanish cop look and start shooting at the black cop. The then the Black cop points his gun at the Spanish cop for a second. Like he didn&#39;t know were the threat was coming from. That was really weird.
Better get that devils lettuce officer ohh your doing so much to stop violent crime... losers
Saavedra deserved what he got. He was an oath breaker. He was going after someone for growing a naturally occurring plant. He should have gotten a real job not some 56k per year puppet gig.
great through the tree shot tho
That headshot tho sheesh
He was a damn fool drawing a gun on the police
Dam head shot
I am so glad that police got shot...
stretch gangggg
He should&#39;ve just mind his business and got out of there
That one domed his and he did the ‚ÄúAH GATDAMN‚Äù vine I swear üòÇ
If he would‚Äôve had a chopper or a Draco he could‚Äôve done some real damage, he just had that Lil 6 shot, yea your not winning that one buddy
All this over cannabis.
i cant stop laughing.. them... vests... you... 100lbs, wet.. natural selection at work
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=175">2:55</a> <b>insert TF2 Scout scream here</b>
Wow they left him for dead
all this over weed and it‚Äôs legal here
His widow said she believed it was it was all a misunderstanding.  He thought  the officers were bad guys posing as the police.  His son said his father was a ‚Äúgreat man‚Äù who didn‚Äôt deserve to be shot.
Headshot
Hope he killed the police that dropped straight up üíØ
Bad guy lost ......good
Why did guy get out of the car and start shooting ?   Was the other guy his brother son what ?    In his defense if it was my family member that was being arrested so be it if they was in the wrong but if a bunch of smart ass cops starting beating him up and hurting them then I would do the same damn thing.   I&#39;ll die for any family being hurt. I love them all and would give my life for them and my country.
The other guy comes out with his cell phone on high...&quot; Ok I&#39;ll pay the bill already...&quot;
Took him out Dealy Plaza Style. The grassy knoll would be proud.
Lol what did that idiot think was gonna happen
God bless our police. Brave, so brave.
i bet that was his favorite tree
This guy went out in slo mo.
I was watching and I‚Äôm like he dead yup he dead
Fuk da police
Thank god the police are viewed in a more positive light in 2021.<br>Once the police realized that they needed to have accountability to combat all the negative press they were getting from the rampant brutality they inflicted upon the public. <br>They wisely formed unbiased panels of civilian arbitrators to monitor officer involved shootings.<br>Now because of this foresight the public has embraced them as pillars of the community and not a vicious thug gang
Cop who delivered the kill shot - Noice
Y&#39;all kill this man but when it comes to mass shooters at schools y&#39;all treat them like if they just won a prize for killing innocent kids.. üñï
It&#39;s a beautiful thing to see some idiot get shot.
OG was a real gangsta
Over weed  come on now
Headshot
I CANNOT SEE WHERE A COP GOT SHOT!?!?!?!? Did he survive!!!
I just came on to this video, and it looks interesting...I just &quot;don&#39;t&quot; have a &quot;CLUE&quot; what it&#39;s all about!!! ANYONE??? PLEASE!!!
Headshot
Lol how the dumbass cop fell
Fucc 12
You don&#39;t find these videos, these videos find you
This cuz of some plants?
Lol I got over 23 warnings
Fake

That&#39;s awful to kill a tree hugger....

This is a tragedy on both sides
acerere !! nos cayo la poli

This looked like a cartel movie
Another law breaking idiot. Time for the biden bunch to riot. Idiots
Because of gta games I have no feelings nowadays
Tony Montana
üòÑüëç
Grow house as in cannabis? You mean to tell me these officers killed human life over a natural herb that God put here for us to use for medicine????????????
dont know what the matter is ... but the dead man was brave and loyal .....
They shouldn&#39;t have not seen the guy in the car.
OMG üò≥
Happy that pig got popped lol karma is a bitch
This video is <a href="http://doctored.how/">doctored.how</a> did the man end up at the porch again,no volume either.still liked it üòéit was 2 people
The police made the mistake of not noticing the gunman. He was standing outside for a good amount of time too.
It looked like a old western gun slinging stand off,
A couple of days rest and he should be good as new.
April 17 2021 a 100 cops killed already this year media says nothing...
Let me just peek over this tree to see where they are so I can get a good shot in... üí• powwow
Guy could have used his Car as a Wedge and would have cleaned up both officers when they had their backs turned. EASY EASY. But he decides to approach in the most weirdest of ways. Serves him right for his stupidly..
Did they officer die as well?
Lights out bud <br>He caught one in the bean lol
So glad we pay immense property taxes to fund police to stop greenhouse workers from growing plants that are less harmless than legal alcohol.
Looked like the cop got shot in the dick!! OUCH!!
takes a set to jump out the car and start shooting it out with the cops for your homes... str8 og right there
That headshot tho
Head shot at the end
Bullet prolly grazed his head ain‚Äôt no way he was dead after that he was moving his legs around but his body went into shock once his head got hit
I love watching police slaughtering people videos. I watch them everyday for years. Its good for the soul. All children should watch them daily. Does something very special for you deep inside after watching them daily. Thank you Zionist owners of YouTube. You guys really help people mentally .
Weed growop? Shot a cop and got killed cause he was growing weed. Thats like getting shot for growing tomatoes and selling them illegally.
Over a grow house. In 2021 it&#39;s so dumb to even get in a car crash over weed
When will cops leave people alone over some dam weed? üò°
all over some weed too, damn.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=100">1:40</a> nice shot
Is that a headshot? Is it neccessary? I thought suspect was crippled already...
yo did he get headshotted
Derrick Lewis- ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs okay‚Äù
We got one boys
Hears my thing they were  watching the whole thing and missed that guy he could just run them down and tried to take off they would have prasued him probably leaveing the other guy
Was the Last shot a head shot if so good work copper
Police are to blame they should leave people alone, man it&#39;s not heroin ffs it&#39;s no more harmful than a tomato
In Us life has not changed from Cowboys era. Crazy Bastard!!! And Crazy laws that left shops selling weapons. But of course  keeps busy Fbi and Police.
I feel like I just died with that guy after watching the 2nd angle....jesus
The dude that got killed is spiritually protected whoever do work for him is üî•. He would have survived if he stayed low and would have got away if he wasn‚Äôt drunk or high.
Whoever took that headshot had serious aim, It was like a pixel peak in rainbow 6
If ur going to point a gun at an office you have to shoot u can&#39;t hesitate because you know Damm well the officers are going to empty there clip on you..
I need some context
Get ready to    ‚ÄúSLUMBER ‚Äú
Shooter: Sneak Attack Critical<br><br>Cops: Critical Strike
Head glitches aren‚Äôt real
Awesome head shot
This looks like a dam movie scene!!
Did the cop get shot in the nuts
That dome shot though...
I got friends did 25 years for weed smuggling....I did six<br><br>Insanity<br><br>Where are our reparations?
All that death over growing weed....how senseless
hope the cop who was shot is fine.
The policeman made the mistake of shooting while being stationary, should have been on the move.
&quot;It&#39;s a beautiful day outside,birds are singing,flowers are- <b>BANG BANG BANG BOOOM</b> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAA-&quot; -Sans last words
I wonder what goes through someone‚Äôs mind in the last seconds of their life, when they know it‚Äôs over.
Is there a need for TWO graphic content disclaimers? Just make it so we can turn them off.
I think the other loser bled out.
you can see that, the guy seen his dad get arrested. he pulled out a gun and pointed at the officers begging them to let him go. The police immediately shoot him, they were trying to kill him. So he shot at the police officer on the right and killed him
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=101">1:41</a> pow right in the kisser
Does anyone know if that cop lived that was being shot at?
That was a clean ass headshot through the tree to finally take him down.
üòÇüòÇ
The cops are idiots on this one. They seemed to have missed the guy going into that car as they were caught off guard when he came out. Also the cops fired the first shot and were way too trigger happy which forced the guy the shoot back. This could have been avoided very easily
yo whoever hit that last shot got good aim
Wow
Campers always ruin it..
bad police work.
Whatever also shot him in his head that was a good shot and yes it is Justice fide he tried to kill them
Yall Poe need to serve your murder sentence
He dum asl for just goin up to them with a gun I would‚Äôve hid behind the car with the gun then start shootings they asses
They hit his off switch
So the officer shot him first( which they can&#39;t do they have to shoot at them to have the right to shoot back) then he gunned down him and then in the face then the top of his torsa
Damn did he catch one to his face?
This is why we need to defund the police.
He just got right into the car...
Hopefully that pig didn&#39;t get to see his family at the end of the day. The less pigs we have the better.
Gosh, America is never the right place to raise your children
Thats one way to handle the situation if you don&#39;t want to go to prison .
The cop given the headshot behind the car: üëç
Lol why didn&#39;t old mate just a) hide i the car <br>B) slam it in reverse and try  ya luck
At all times secure the vehicles.
Miami PD is a joke. Remember when they killed the UPS driver and the bystander 2 years ago.
This is wild
Guy could have probably just hid in the car and they would have never seen him
Nobody saw the guy in the car...
Yea he asked for that
Guess that&#39;s what happens when cops shoot first and don&#39;t shoot straight. :( Poor officer.
&quot;Growhouse&quot; what a scam.
Man&#39;s on x games mode
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=99">1:39</a>     ouch
headshot
GREAT JOB TO THE HERO FOR SHOOTING THOSE BLUE ISIS THUGS: HOPEFULLY THEY DIED SLOW!
Hmm. Guess it was high noon in Miami-Dade.
lol
Wonder how many time the dead guy was shot, still moving after damn
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=195">3:15</a> at least he didn&#39;t drop his phone. :D
The first cop being shot reminds me of GTA 4. The animation when you shoot the cops or anyone is exactly what he did
Over some weed
Christmas feel good video.
dude got his dome hit
That‚Äôs a real Cuban og man went out like Scarface
HEAD SHOT
„Öú
That&#39;s crazy he has the same last name
Glad he was conscious to reach for his headshot and squirm for a while
He can take a hell of a beating
All this over weed.?! So the cop died for a stupid reason. Smh
How did they not see the guy get in the car?
Police are bullies and thugs.
Ima goin out the same way
Nobody even noticed the dude in the car until he started shooting.  He might&#39;ve been able to lay down and gotten away.  Either way stupid.  Hope that one cop that got shot is okay.
The guy he try to protect, why ever, gave up and lifes while his mate is dead but he started it lul
Seek Christ Jesus YHVH
This is my uncle I was 8 <br>when we went to the hospital he‚Äôs the one who gets shot  and he got shot 5 times if u didn‚Äôt know if he did not have that vest on he would‚Äôve been killed he‚Äôs the fist one btw have a good day
Head shoot
One for one nice
Talk about a crossfire nightmare
All this over a plant...............................sometimes while traagic that LEOs die,  maybe they should at what they do,  and stopharrassing people over a plant..........and to murder someone over a plant is just the lowest of the low,  these EOs are simply that,  the lowest of the low for even bothering about a plant......I mean you don&#39;t see them run about in the woods arresting plants....that should be a no brainer,  leave plants alone....they are that.....Plants.<br>Tragedy here is that the LEOs just for no ther reason than a plant deced to murder a guy
This guy had a suicide wish but police should have been more prepared, they didn&#39;t even noticed the guy in his car, luckily he didn&#39;t kill any officer
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=195">3:15</a>.  <br>- Did I do it man?  Are you free?<br>- Yeah man, you got &#39;em all.<br>- ok . . .good.
Seems like black officer paused at the car like he knew the guy was in there..but when they brought the other guy out resisting his attention went directly over there
I hope the police officer is okay.
Dude should of stayed in the car and acted like he didn&#39;t know what was going on. He still would of been alive.
Damn imagine looking out your window and seeing this go on üò≥.
Just a regular day in Florida
Even after being hit in the head he was still alive
(&quot;Well Satan, he&#39;s all your&#39;s...&quot;)  blackgunsmatter
You seen that pig did the bunny hop
Cops walked by him in the car. Their mistake. This was a huge botched job. And really - if they would have did surveillance and take each one on the street from x they would both be alive.
Seriously. That recon was amazing.
good job u killed the guys growing weed üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
He could stayed in the car or drive away lol.
I mean what did he expect?
How did Police pass by the car in driveway? ? ? Should have cleared it
Look at the top of his head. üí•
They got killed for something that is legal in my country lol
What an idiot.  Pulling a gun on cops NEVER ends well.  <br><br>That guy was simply too stupid to be consuming valuable O2.
Ill never understand why cops literally throw people to the ground that are obviously complying and aren&#39;t resisting. like the guy was literally hands up walking to the cop no sign of aggression and the cop throws him to the ground, like just arrest him.... Why throw him to the ground. No reason for it.
Only idiots would wanna shoot out with cops
Happens every other week here .. I‚Äôm in a grow house now ....<br><br>Totally kidding
Dirty domestic terrorist pigs killing a man over weed. All cops and cop supporter should be executed.
Aired his ass out
One less nikka..
Awesome!
They shot his head is he dead?
Play it at 1.5x for dramatic and special effects
Now this is hella funny ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Seems like a rather messy way to say, &quot;Hey, you kids get off my lawn!&quot;
The officers‚Äô timing was atrocious
That bad guy earn my respect tbh <br>He died like a boss
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Excellent shootout
The gun üî´ is flying high like üëç an F35
These new Euphoria physics look sick, great job Rockstar games ü§ò
Dude in the car is more of a man than any welfare queen gun grabbing israeli cop. Imagine murdering a guy over weed and saying its just your job. All cops are traitors
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=101">1:41</a>
They must&#39;ve been called the &quot; Skinny bone &quot; gang...lol
Taking out the trash
All im saying is If you have to test me enough for me to pull on you, I&#39;m taking you with me, pussy ass badge or not.
Trash people try to shoot police
I feel more sad about  those police officers  I dont feel bad 1 bit for those suspects  I want to be a cop when I grow up but I have to wait till im 21 im 12 right now but now im getting nervous to be a cop I dont wanna die by people who I did nothing to
üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
Eye for an eye true justice
Still have no idea what idiots like him think. Shooting at a bunch of cops, what was he expecting?<br>Even if he managed to kill them, he wouldn&#39;t get out of this.
There&#39;s always that one house that is way over landscaped in like a regular a** neighborhood.
That&#39;s what that guy gets for shooting at the police
he should have stayed in the car
He shot himself
A growhouse? A fu&#39;in grow house? This is the dumbest stuff ive ever seen. The cops and suspect wanted to die on that hill? A grow house where they grow freaking weed? Wow
Well jus like in pubg and call of duty u not supposed to peek the same spot twice smh
Look at the p*<b>*</b> ass cops running shooting bullets in other people&#39;s ways cuz he&#39;s scared have a gunfight those are people we need carrying guns around
My guy said woop woop sound of police(add lips, blah blaaah braaaaa)
you can see by the blood in his back he took a direct hit to the chest and was not taken down by it, when adrenaline is dumping it takes a CNS shot to stop someone (head). Once he took that headshot it was instant lights out.
He looked like cowboys back in the days
All because pigs want revenue and enjoy murdering people.  Pretty soon theyll be hanging from the street lights for their crimes. Ill be having a cognac and laughing like a bastard.
Damn..that man slumped üò≠
What a waste of a man of courage.a man contains all this bravery within him doesn&#39;t deserve this absurd fate.wish his bravery was married to some wisdom.
Lol
Did anyone see how the pistol went flying in the air? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=178">2:58</a>
HEADSHOT
Got what He deserved <br>Human trash
Always love the videos where the bad guy POS bleeds out. Hope the officer that was wounded healed completely. God Bless All police officers in this country that have to put up with hateful groups like BLM ( Black Looting Murderers ) and the leftist libtards. Stay Safe Blue.
That was an abysmal job by those cops...officer Saavedra had the drop as the guy was not firing at him to start with...he put shots on him, but never even considered cover, and then got absolutely smoked.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=101">1:41</a> kill shot ü§£ü§£ü§£
another one bite the dust
Wow he died why shoot him in his back abused when hes shoot in the leg allready hes in his property dont matter what they wanted for but is not right to get asasenatted by police this is in pure camera
The first 2 cops walking up completely missed the dude in the car?
kill or be kill people or cops   i want to live so i have to kill a cop if they are trying to tack my life or family life this is war
Hi
I wonder if they didn&#39;t know he was in the car? You&#39;d think they would have kept eyes one him.
Shouldn‚Äôt have pulled a gun ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The messed up on the stake out. They didnt see the guy get into his car.
&quot;Dammm&quot; Daniel back at it again whit the head shots
Shiii that boy went out like a viking
Thank God the officer survived 3 shots!
Damn good head shot through the tree!!!
Damn nice headshot
Cop need more training to move and take cover while firing
Jhon savadra is my uncle I went to the hospital and saw him lucky he survived
I guess now his hat will not be so tight!!!! Lmao!!!
Lol..Damn...and he didnt even get to smoke his morning cigarette yet!!!!<br>Hmmmm....than again I do see second head smoke!!....oops hand smoke....lmao!!!
the cop that started shooting should be fired
Grow as in weed? Wow.
His face turned into skull powder.
Should&#39;ve had a snickers
THIS FOR SOME WEED ü§î
oohh gta5 taking shot <br>physics is real
Now you see why it is against  the law to have front windows tinted.
How bout dat head shot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=100">1:40</a> üõéüõé
Love it!
Tony Montana
Shot in the back of the head by the one he shot
This is exactly why you need to shoot multiple rounds.
I love the police just stop scarying black people
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
He said oops no problem
Shot to hell ! Love these videos
I hope the cop died too
They used his cameras to show us that glorious headshot lmao
Gta 5 be like...
Kopfschu√ü! Volltreffer! Head shot - game over.
Had to be a sniper to pull that shot off. Between the two tree trunks, awesome shot. This guy had to be on drugs or just sick of life.
thank god they got this man and his death plants off the streets before they hurt literally no one. I don&#39;t care how many children have to grow up without a father as long as all these gosh dang drugs are out of my neighborhood.
lucky shot by the policeman
He had no chance... I guess he wanted to go out..
How can this even happen?? Firearm aimed at an officer = shoot to kill, not shoot once and maybe he had a change of heart...
He could kill at least 2 cops if he start shooting imidiatley... They didn&#39;t even noticed him in the car ^^<br> As Tuco says&#39;&#39; If you have to shoot then shoot don&#39;t talk&#39;&#39;
poor tree
all this mess for weed??? Totally stupid
all that because of a plant that kills nobody...meanwhile pharma industry kills million human guinea pigs around the globe and ofc pushing their synth drugs...no actions there, why? because in their mind, the right ones profit from it...your country is a disgrace, you became what the nazis wished to be. congrats
Was this over weed what the hell thats our people, people.
Como siempre cubanos
Nice shot by that officer...what was scary is the officer that was blindly throwing out shots all over the place as he was retreating.
Y‚Äôall sound like a bunch of bitches taking up for them pigs like that strait up
Looks like these officers need some firearms re-training.  Couldn&#39;t hit the broad side of a barn!
The guy behind the tree was playing hop scotch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=173">2:53</a> gets 150 xp for headshot
See it to believe it!Imbeciles;<br>That was Reckless of the Police! What, did they all look away for 34 seconds and didn&#39;t see this man (RIP) get in the car? Just stupid!üêùüêùüêù
How marijuana effects your ability to shoot straight. <br>Bad guy who got the drop on three police officers at close range and started firing first, didn&#39;t hit one officer( thank God). The police officers connect with a couple hits, including a well placed head shot, and none of them had been smoking weed, lol.
what a fking idiot...
The Indian popped out of the car with some serious Michael Jackson tactics...
All these cops walked right by the main suspect in the car. Timing was superb by the gunman tho. Head shot by cops ended it
What was he expecting to accomplish
all that over weed ,
What a stupid asshole.
Was that Jim Carey?
I hate campers
poor tree
The Two Suspects Were Dressed Identical same Jean&#39;s, same hat, same shirt, same age and same complection. They were basically twins a common strategy used to throw off surveillance undercover Police. üòÉ
This guy really wanted to die when he pulled the gun ! Police made a bad decision when ignoring the man in the car and one of them got shot.
A well regulated militia
Savage
Atleast he shot 1 cop
Shooting case‚ùå<br>Just Cause‚úîÔ∏è<br>American rule of law
Bunch thugs in badges walk up on my house in plain clothes and best believe youre getting shot.
cops first reaction was to shoot the man unfortunately the man didnt die and returned fire.  if the cop got out of the line of fire first he might still be alive. maybe these cops should think about the lives they are putting in danger over enforcement of  morally corrupt laws such as these. live by the sword die by the sword.
One minute you&#39;re dancing, the next minute you&#39;re dead.
All that for weed ?
Death by 2nd Amendment.
old man was brave as hell damn. crazy way to die
Moral of the story, don&#39;t try to put people in cages for growing and selling a damn plant
All this over a plant
How not to secure a scene...
What a Dumbass
He could have hid in that car and bailed his mans out.. idiot
Florida man doing florida man things
Obviously too much pot smoking.  Who pulls a f--king pistol on a bunch of cops?   WTF was his endgame plan?  Moron.
the way i see it the cops werent victims they had that coming going after someone for a victimless crime
,.....
why yall gotta slow it down
Wasn&#39;t very smart of that shooter to jump out of that car and start shooting at the police. he could have just got a few years in jail for growing weed, probably breaking probation and having weapons but now he is dead. I guess its cheaper for the tax payers this way
Crazy. That guy slipped into that car a second before the first cop walked up.
beautiful headshot
All this over weed.... what a tragedy
He went out like a real G
what a fuckin shot through the tree into his dome
Which police officer died
They failed to notice potential shooter in vehicle. The shoot-out could of been prevented.
Straight dome shot
Weird ass video. Why was the cop reversing
Not sure why the perp got out and started shooting. WTF?  His buddy still got arrested and he&#39;s dead.
All this over some weed! Come on this is just BS! And not sure what that dude was thinking about when he tried and really failed to try and shoot it out with 3 cops all by himself. Last mistake he ever made.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=102">1:42</a> muffin topped
Mati konyol
damn, cops had no idea that suspect was in the car. Then the dude pops out with a gun and he takes a few bullets before someone pops his dome with a headshot. If you&#39;re gonna play shoot em up with the cops you gotta expect to go down.
Always check cars when you walk by them.
That&#39;s the very meaning of friends for life. What a hero! He gave his best and he gave them hell!
Well that was stupid to do!!!
The timing of that man getting in the car and police pulling up is perfect.
GET OUT MY YARD!
Son, your dad was 360 scoped.
He died over weed smh
Yet people still don&#39;t understand why officers have to fire multiple shots to neutralize a thug. Well , here you go...
Insanity ... killing each other damn weed ...
Man I&#39;ve had my drunk days that looked remarkably like the guy holding on to the tree...
One cop ran frount and shot back he could of shot the other cop
A good reason to explain the shoot till they drop method.
Did he shoot himself in the head or was that the officer?
They killed a man over some weed???. Wtf!!!
Your all wrong the kill shot came from the officer who was shot and ran behind the SUV I&#39;ve seen the full video
Should have let the man grow his green..weed never hurt anyone ever.
Gonorrea se hizo matar por su amigo jefe o lo que sea eso s√≠ es lealtad
He ate hella bullets üòÇ limping on one leg lmfao
That&#39;s what happens when your camping behind a tree.
Poor tree - it must have taken several hits. I hope it&#39;s okay!
On his way to get papers.
Why didn&#39;t he just get down and stay in the car he would&#39;ve been good
bwajajaj idiot
Weed should be legal
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Don&#39;t draw on police and you won&#39;t get shot. Words to live by.
‚Ä¢ IT WAS ALL PHOTOSHOPPED!
1st Rule dont get high on your own supply. Dum dum
Shoulda stayed in the car ... stayed quiet... and maybe you would have not been seen....   stupid ass guy
Acted too slow, he could&#39;ve had them all. What a shame.
if the guy stayed in car they may have never seen him.
As much as i hate to say it in this case.<br>You live by the sword<br>You die by the sword.
Police officers are doing a hell of a job at the risk of their lives.  Whoever is in charge please pay them very well.  Their job is extremely very risky.  ($7,000 monthly) without tax. Full amount please.
He learned his lesson!
HeHeHe :) play station
Dude that was in the car, was he there jus to buy some grass from dude that they was arresting??? If so, loosing his plug wasn&#39;t worth his own life!!! Over all tho wth he didn&#39;t jus kept himself in his car is a complete mind boggler to me.... ü§îü§îü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øüò±üò±üò±ü§êü§êü§ê
cops know the danger up for it or not you don&#39;t always win
Was the tree ok thats al matters and the police
Lemme pull my .22 handgun on these three officers here and wave it around before I shoot. lolololololol Dumbass.
They must of had more than just plants in the house
If the perk that was not even noticed had an assult rifle there would be cops layed out.<br>They need better tactics lol
That&#39;s was funny and gangster
maybe he thought, he was wild bill hickok for a moment.
The cops were lucky he didn‚Äôt decide to come out on the passenger side.
Regardless of what happened, these rookies obviously aren&#39;t trained well enough to frickin LOOK at ALL the obstacles around them. Just goes to show, you, as officers, might THINK you know what&#39;s up, but these officers won&#39;t be dumb enough to overlook OBVIOUS kill points ever again.
Did the police offer die ?
Bruh the dude was hugging the tree like &quot; please give my life?&quot;
But damn man still got to look in to that car. My god man.
ironic 2019 weeds legal
Well another great episode of cops and robbers. Its been goin on a long time.
All respect to the guy shooting behind the tree.
that&#39;s how I want to die
..But what was the plan ü§î take out all the police with a .38ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Moral of the story. Don‚Äôt be a criminal and don‚Äôt shoot at cops.
Headshot üëçüèº
Larger cal.
No one is dead, he was a criminal trying to kill policemen...
Please ditch your 9mm&#39;s and start carrying .45&#39;s or .357&#39;s where a couple of shots will do the job...several hits and the guy is still firing back hitting one officer...
Would of been best of if the perp smoked all 3 of those pigs !!! Fucki g blue ISIS scum at it again !!üòàüëøü§üü§üü§üü§Æü§Æü§Æüê∑üê∑üê∑üêΩüêΩüêΩ
Whats sad is the government has wasted so many lifes over weed that it is just crazy and makes no sense just think people if they will kill you over a little taxes imigane what will happen if we didn&#39;t have guns people better wake the hell up is all I&#39;m saying
I love watching criminals getting shot.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=101">1:41</a> who here thinks that was a head or neck shot? I&#39;m gonna say forehead lol
Move to Oregon where its legal to grow, good grief... avoid all this nonsense.
nice to see that punk assed cops and their overwhelming force tactics fail against real men..that dude saw 3 guns and still engaged...would make chuck norris proud
Hecouldve have lowkey just layed back and hid in the car smh got killed over some weed
Homeboy in the car tho!! G thang!!
If the growhouse dudes could have just waited a few years, they&#39;d be legal!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=199">3:19</a> Is that his actual death?
So the policeman couldnt drop him shooting from what 12 feet? and why not back of to get behind the car...
Im thinking he didn&#39;t think they were cops.... Thought they were robbing them... I mean they had vest with police on it.. But the random cars made him suspicious... And he went down like a.G... Wasnt gonna leave his homie hanging..
AAAAAHHHHHHHH  you got me---------------------------------
literally no weapon discipline at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=76">1:16</a> as the cop fires while turned away..... glad no innocent bystanders were killed or injured by the moron randomly firing w/o even looking.
He was a bad shot but a great target. What an idiot.
I bet training tactics now include sweeping all the cars in the area.
To die for weed what&#39;s the worst you could get a week in jail if the judge was in a bad mood
that perp on the ground show had a lot o blood in him coming out.
At least he&#39;d went out with a bang
Headshot!!
Good shot.
Why is the category of this video &quot;sports&quot;?
There are no police units/cruisers present, just unmarked cars and men in plain clothes.  If they had rolled up with 4 lights and sirens, or swat, this would have been avoided.  Poor performance all around by these officers, and all of it over a plant???  Wow, way to go government and religion, you make the world a better place :)
died fighting on his feet pretty dam ballsy
9mm don&#39;t do anything to stop someone.
You see..karma come back to you..when you kill innocent people in the streets these day..not about judge police officers and what you do in our community
The police say criminals are basically stupid. Well, at least criminals have the excuse they&#39;ve never received any training. After staking out a house then moving in on a suspect, what highly trained law enforcement officer literally walks passed a vehicle parked in that driveway without checking for anyone inside? ...These cops, obviously!

Lol cop got shot
Nice headshot.
What a dumbass. Did he think he was going to take out 3 cops, and then get away with it? That would&#39;ve been his best possible outcome. Yet, impossible.
The police guy who was shot shouldn&#39;t have stopped shooting until the guy was down.
when guns are even carried by lunatics
He went out with a Bang... I feel him
great shot !!   nice to see consequences !   hopefully...a  little pain was felt.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=101">1:41</a><br>Shot right between the V of the tree trunks and hit him on the top of his head.....he is dead.
Fucken crazy. 30 secs give or take and this has a total different outcome. I guess when it&#39;s your time it&#39;s your time.
The <b>C.C.C.</b> (Career Criminals Coalition) advised they are suing the states who have enhanced punishment for killing police officers. The coalition states that career criminals have a right to work just as any other professionals and the police have no right to impede them as they make their living. Maxine the &#39;&#39;brain&#39;&#39; Waters said she will introduce legislation that allows career criminals to pursue their life&#39;s work without police discrimination.
Aug 22, 2019. I drove by this house yesterday.  Its at intersection of Coral Way and SW 6Oth st. First house on the street. The driveway and that tree are still the same. Although its been 7 years. I still seen the bullett marks in the tree where it forks off
Headshot 8x damage multiplier
Gasping for air bye bye Ass hole!!!!!!!!!
Nothing more warm an fuzzy than seeing a deuce bag shot in the head!!!!!!!!!!!!
That is just messed up!!!
This video should be in the POLICE academy for training purposes. Footage contained some security failure suck as making sure the perimeter was secure,the individual in the vehicle should‚Äôve been searched and cuffed before going any further. The entire incident was a failure period.<br>What happened these things:<br>Armored vehicles?<br>More law enforcement officers?<br>Closing the streets for all the directions <br>Look out personal<br>I mean I can keep going
If the guys in the car had an Ak, they would have been fucked, especially the first cop, just saying. Always look for the scumbag in the car.
Gunman has gun on right hand,,,,,,cop moves to his left.....making the cop a target ...very bad choice.  The gunman was hit but still was firing to his right in line with officer.
That head shot was ruthless ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This video is a very good reason why marijuana needs to be legalized everywhere
I hope them cops got shot up to wankers
I hope he killed that bitch ass cop
Guy by the tree was bleeding pretty good or was he bleeding pretty bad.
Dude could have drove away
Folks like Thinking Ronin who have a    g r i e v a n c e  WRT YT --- Please note that German YoooTooobers have mounted a serious challenge to these abuses, working with a century-old organization that started by representing the collective interests of metal workers.

They&#39;ve presented a list of reform demands to YT, and given them a deadline, after which they intend to file suit in the German Courts, arguing that content producers&#39; rights are the same as employees, because of the monopolistic control the VAST monolithic organization enjoys over all individual content producers. <br>Link:                 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUxxLZz_2NU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUxxLZz_2NU</a> <br><br><br><i>Note: The featured organizer of this German effort, Joerg Sprave, has a popular channel where he shows Sling shot devices he designs and builds.

In other words... Don&#39;t hesitate to continue placing rounds in the SOB until the offender is no longer capable of lifting the muzzle or squeezing the trigger. Skeletonized works for me. <b>Just be sure to bring plenty of extra magazines.</b>  Miami-Dade Police Officer John Saavedra was able to leave the hospital after a week or so and return to his work.
Cops are hacking they using aim assist lol
Wait this is 441 smith st ?? We‚Äôre  looking for 414 ..... my bad , tell that guy near the tree , no hard feelings
Funny thing is...im smoking while watching this....spooky right
Why didn&#39;t the officer in the beginning check the vehicle as he passed? I thought that action was SOP when conducting a raid (ie. checking anything in the path that could hide or conceal someone)?
what a crap officer. forgets about his armed target behind the tree 3 meters from him and starts pointing his gun towards the street and gets shot.
Wish he could have taken a few of those new era gangsters with him
He was a gangster  should have aimed for head shots
By
why is this slowed down? stupid
The cops did follow protocol
Bulala ezonto marnüòÇüòÇüòÅüöìnumber 1
Fk yeah that was awesome üòÉ
Big mistake that he didnt fire at the cops
DUMBASSES
The cop by the car could&#39;ve dropped him if he shot with better form, used two hands, and really engaged the threat ready to kill for his life.
Why wouldn&#39;t he just run, he had a window with a good chance for a getaway, but instead, he retardedly jumps out dumping on Troll &amp; gets himself murked. You can always grow more weed homie, but once you brandish ANY weapon, or even just something with the slightest resemblance to a weapon, you&#39;ve signed your Death Warrant in blood. Ignorant fucks! They have a License to Kill, shoot with 2 hands and ask questions later. Literally could NEVER win with an army. You&#39;re just dead üíÄ with NO weed period. And if you intend on a &quot;Death by cops,&quot; that&#39;s premeditated suicide, and you&#39;ll still burn in hell eternally. Read ANY Bible.
Glad he didn‚Äôt make it saved a lot of money on a trial
Unprofessional
People are stupid.
Ummm and if pot was legal this would of never happened in the first place.
All because they were growing a plant. So lame. Way to protect and serve
Last round went to the face
Rookie shootout tryouts
I feel like there wasn‚Äôt any shootout before the cop decided to open fire
Should have got out the other side of the car and picked his targets 3 head shots done!!!!!
Ping headshot
The shooter was officially a complete idiot. The police were there because of weed being grown. The shooter could&#39;ve left it there, but instead he summarily opens fire on multiple police officers. From that moment on only one of two things is going to happen: either he takes out all the police, becomes America&#39;s Most Wanted, gets inevitably caught and gets the death penalty, or he gets gunned down there and then on the spot.<br><br>Either way, his life is officially over. Choosing that over accepting the consequences for growing weed shows why he&#39;s an idiot.
Hey cartel hate police it&#39;s straight up how they raised in the
those stanky leg dance moves were on point. some one hire this guy for Americas got talent
Where the police there because these people at this house was harming others? Or was this because of a &quot;War On Drugs&quot; which of course is a war on people! The supreme court has ruled in the case of abortion that women have the right to do with their own bodies what they will and that government has no authority or jurisdiction in the mater. My question to all of you is, doesn&#39;t that same rule apply to everyone for every reason? If you don&#39;t govern your own body who does? Think people, you don&#39;t see shootouts in the streets any longer when it comes to alcohol! After prohibition ended so did the violence! People are getting filthy rich off drugs being illegal, the government is gaining power over the people and becoming a militant force because of this.  END THIS WAR ON DRUGS!
If he wanted to survive that he should&#39;ve shot the officer to his left then the one to his right then the one to the left of the one to his right and he would&#39;ve survived that fire fight
He needed more fire power.
They‚Äôre all idiots and deserves what happened to them. Yes,I do mean the police as well. What the bloody hell is going on in their brains that they think this is how to solve any sort of conflict?
Good call of duty kill.!!
ONE CLEAN CASE, SURVEILLANCE PULL GUN FIRST AND SHOOT
Thr dumbass in the car should&#39;ve Just drove off
To paraphrase chef, &quot;don&#39;t get out of the car, never get out of the car&quot;.
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=121">2:01</a> the timing couldn&#39;t of been any better plus the tinted windows he they all Walk right by him &amp; don&#39;t even notice him
Cant even believe they didnt clear the yard and cars first...Clearly a fatal mistake...Also, idk why that officer stopped shooting and the other officer didnt move in while he had the chance. Either way I hope that officer that was hit survived and is alright.
hey man nice shot
So let me get this straight... They were growing weed? That&#39;s what a growhouse is isn&#39;t it? Man.... Some grass ain&#39;t worth getting killed over!
If these cops were to execute this task why did they not do a perimeter check why wasnt this location being monitored before and assighnment was to be persued ?it dont add up also there back up did not get there untill minutes later?all of these factors play into effect especially as a law inforcement .im an x felon and i wouldve been 1 step ahead of these 3 stooges
What a dumb ass he should just stay in the car and save his own life but instead come out and fire at 3 police officer
HEADSHOT.... +150
Pussy cop got hit in the vest and turned to run like a bitch. Then still shoots randomly backwards without aiming like an idiot.  Over a grow.  Grow a pair of balls and go harass some real criminals.  Y&#39;all deserve to be shot.
He missed
This looks just like the miami vice episode I‚Äôm watching!  Cool!
The most corrupt cops is Miami-dade police!!

Just left the weed spot and the way he stood like a boss in the beginning of the video and that he thought he&#39;s clint Eastwood he could down 3 armed guys... It must have been reeeeaaally good weed.
scary part is if tht uy didn&#39;t hesitate it would have been three cops laying there and not him .. fucked up all over weed and its legal now
This guy must have been tired of living.
cops shot first shocker there nice job de-escalating the situation Nice work for the most well armed gang in the world !
What he lacked in brains he more than made up for with courage and groovy disco moves.
LMAO! how is this video categorized as sports?
Hit my channel up for HARD TRAP BEATS !!!!!
Well
Only in America. A plant that is a billion dollar industry in one state is a police raid in another.
Back, and to the left; Back, and to the left; Back, and to the left....
You can see that after the shot to the perps head after he falls he shits his pants as he dies.... The sphincter releases and he shits himself... Before that it was all pucker factor.... Good deal scumbag is dead justice is served
Why they don&#39;t go to the black hoods to incautate drugs?<br>They always go to the latin people to steal they hard earned harvest, but they don&#39;t go to the blacks hoods because the blacks are over-represented by the so called &quot;civil right&quot; organizations and the mass media.
Fukien cops
All for growing weed?  which is legal in many states now
So many perspectives on this video 3 years later, So here we are today and laws need to be changed.Officers defended themselves,they also made mistakes that almost were fatal.<br>Luck was on their side.1 Dead Defendant and His friend doing time as per the Crazy Law his friend died so he takes the rap for his death.Given the circumstances    that&#39;s wrong.And we move on.<br>So Many have died All in the name of a Weed,that finally is or has been legalized on many areas of the World.Sheer Politics and Hypocrits.<br>Legalize it and Tax it Like Tabacco and Alcohol and All Governments and  Entitys  involved will be &quot;So Happy Together,&quot;Just like the Song.
How horrible to watch, why did they not get an ambulance to try to save him, !!!!!!! üòû so sad

That&#39;s what buckwheat gets for pointing a gun on a cop.
The cop who ran towards house is shooting backwards and down...??
The growhouse suspect&#39;s stupidity (believes he can successfully takedown 4 armed cops), would be a good case for the absence of lucid brain function while under the influence of marijuana.<br><b><i>Hey Kids &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t do drugs &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just Say &quot;NO!&quot;</i></b>

Excelente trabalho ! Chumbo nos vagabundos !.
Put your hands behind your back.....oh , wait , you cant because your are DEAD!!!!
This guys got more balls than those three cops put together
Pulling a gun on a cop is NEVER a good idea. Pulling a gun on three cops is downright suicidal. What was this guy thinking?!
Buddy needed a draco
The blue checkered shirt gang?
That was terrible timing. The guy got in the car like 6 seconds before the cops rolled up.
This is why marijuana needs to be decriminalized. Too many officers and people are killed each year over this. This is just like prohibition when people wanted to ban alcohol and when they did it created people like Al Capone and a lot of corruption of law enforcement and government officials. By making it illegal you create a greater evil. If tomorrow congress banned caffeine then there would be people being killed over caffeine. Marijuana was legal for 194 years before it was outlawed and it grew like a weed and no one ever died over it then. Its made illegal and then you create drug cartels and a never-ending drug war that can never be won. It is estimated that only 4% of illegal drugs are seized each year. This means that 96% of illegal drugs make it thru. We build more and more prisons and lockup more people than any other country in the world and at the current rate we are going we will end up with 2 types of people in the future, the people in jail and the people who guard them.<br>I believe that many people are now beginning to realize how bad the laws against marijuana are and now are deciding to decriminalize it and tax it instead.
Police should have cleared the vehicles on premise
Who says potheads are nonviolent?
Big mistake not  checking if anyone was in the cars
<b>&quot;HEADSHOT&quot;</b>
Awesome head shot. Always glad to see the scumbag doin&#39; the funky chicken.
This video is a perfect example to why cops fire so many rounds the guy had atleast 6 shots to the chest and was still standing for another 30 seconds
Head shot
What happened to the other cop that went down is he dead?
Haha headshot always works the best
Looks like a man defending his property against a tyrannical force.
He probably thought he was been rob..most likely the cops in civil clothes never ID themself as police.
He was severe wounded and than shot him in his head - its murder , murder
Does He Know That
He had to protect his boss I guess but why point a gun at police and not shoot? Did he really expect them to just kindly let him go and walk back to their car.
That kill shot was a thing of beauty
The friend was like i died for you
It looked like a sketch unreal
Cop that headshotted him just ended this whole man&#39;s career
Good riddance to that criminal
he would&#39;ve been alive still if he stayed in the car
Look at the bright side.  Cops were careless, but it resulted in 1 less Miami cockroach. <br><br>I&#39;m thinking the dead guy was never a threat to be a 5 time Jeopardy champion.  I just wish they could have shot the other roaches.
No Reason Just Looks
So this dumbass reckoned it was a good idea to take on multiple armed policemen with just a revolver, clearly he&#39;s better off dead.
BRAVO POLICE
He was Old Scool.
They always give a white guy the chance to get em .
The one cop shot the other cop....dumbass
Good job to the officers!! Need to clear the cars first tho, could have went south real quick
Just for growing plants....smh
they really didnt see him get in that car???? wow
I see a couple of mistakes here on the officers part. They were taken by surprise it seems because of the 1st guy spotting their car parked across the street. He immediately walked to the car and actually was able to get in and just barely got the door closed before officers moved in. They were so focused on the second man coming out, they just walked right by the car the first man was in one by one. No one stayed at a distance. For him, THAT would have been the time to not back out of there and start a police chase but to climb over to the passenger side and let himself out on the opposite side of the action. It was defiantly in his favor and worth a shot. No pun there! Instead he grabbed his gun and surprised the officers from behind. Amazing how thy didn‚Äôt just start unloading into him. I think the first man had a chance at just walking right out of there given the timing of when he moved a got into the car just when cops were only focused on backing out their driveway and the others making their way to the second man. While his friend there was whaling his arms in the air, that made all the officers focus on him as being a possible further threat and being difficult to cuff. Not gonna go easily. All their eyes on him is when this guy made his move but I think it was the wrong move to make! Unfortunate.
Bullets are not friendly.  Unfortunately people die. <br>It really is sad.
I know this is an old video but look at it carefully: If the guy that was being arrested had a gun and the same intentions as the one that emerged from the car in the driveway, at minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=71">01:11</a> when he&#39;s being let go by the cops running for cover, they would have been killed or badly injured. I wonder if they were rookies or untrained bullies who only focused on getting their man while they&#39;re in a group? Like a pack of wolves.
What&#39;s a growhouse?
How did they not see the dude go in the car and wheres the head shot, they pump like 10 bullets in the dude and he still standing. Last shot should&#39;ve been the first shot.
Net result is one less SCROTT polluting the planet.
its going to hurt when u get shot but u have to stay in the fight dont turn your back
That dude been playing to many video games what an idiot
This video shows classical terrible training on the cops part, so you see the shooter get in a car completely undetected by the looks of it worst surveillance techniques possible, the cops then begin a raid on the suspected grow house obviously there would have been a weapons risk first cop on the property comes in from a blind corner soon followed by officers I can only assume we&#39;re doing terrible surveillance and failed to mark all possible targets they intercept a target(non shooter) and begin to apprehend him all backs turned on the suspect house blissfully unaware that an armed criminal has a significant ambush position he leaps out and points his weapon at an officer and begins discharging bullets. In a brief exchange of fire but before they have time to react he&#39;s hit someone, the officer who was shot was the dumbest he stands and gets shot and only moves to cover upon being shot no hazard perception in the slightest, don&#39;t get me started on the shooter he leaps from the car and uses a terrible peice of cover he&#39;s shot but has an advantage and instead of running, crawling or whatever behind the car he remains hobbling and weaving behind the tree until finally he peaks his head above the branch and the one Cop who can aim give a kill shot to the face, no assessment of the area, no target marking, terrible reaction time and aiming, stupid interception techniques, awful hazard perception bad show all round
The cops surveillance sucked, how you not see the dude get in the car?? Cops must of been burning one
All this ova a joint ,??? Dammm Say it ain‚Äôt so,,   Must of been of been sum DANK WEED, that‚Äôs all I can say
good bodyguard... i know his shooting at police and its very bad, but as pro he defend his object till death
probably the worst bunch of cops I&#39;ve ever seen
he put his hand on his head after the bullet went past like he had a headache. This character is something else.
The death of the creep worked for me.<br>Hope the cop made it okay.
Hmm no racist comments ü§î
mannn cops always gotta win ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The pothead was going to be locked in cage with real criminals and mental patients.._.It just happened to <a href="http://me.in/">me.In</a> yuma county Colorado tiny town in eastern colorado.._.They showed up in a tank our plants are hemp.Thank god we have receipts from the hemp expo where we purchased  them.._i am being threatened with 8years in prison ._.I was contemplating suicide..Luckyly ifound the  vendor and found my receipts  that way i am acancer patient  thats all i have tsay about  that
And the idiot came out of the car they didnt even know he was in for what? Exactly?? O_o
Forget jail.all these bastards need to be shot.this world would be a lot <a href="http://better.it/">better.it</a> is when u say POOR CRIMINALS that you are corrupting this land.
So they were growing plants ?  <br>Why are the police coming to lock them in cages again? <br><br>This was all completely unnecessary.
Head shot poor man
The pigs have won tonight. And the could all sleep soundly, and everything is allright
After I fire them¬†shots off, I runn around AMPED...<br>Go over to his gravesite and do a Touchdown dance!!!
Damn this guy got aired out bigtime
Final shot would make a range instructor proud.
Dumb stupid criminal , went down in a heap, nice one!!!!!!
HEAD SHOT ü§§üî´
He wanted to die
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=101">1:41</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24gECuCSYec&amp;t=175">2:55</a> for the money shot.
He should have used his bullet time like Max Payne.
Why not leave the car from the other side and then use the motor block as cover? Because Rambo came out in 1982.
Stupid pigs are doing surveillance and miss the guy who walks out the front door &amp; into the car ??? Then the guy doesn‚Äôt come out of the car guns blazing or back up into a strategic position or exit passenger side and use the car as a shield! Over WEED!!! Lmao
Scarface was his favorite movie.
The walking outside is an undercover cop
If you are survelling a place, how did you not see the man in the car.
This is for real? ;)  Dumb and dumber... (guess which one is which by yourself).
Wheres the team revive?
Why?
If I just heard the narrative of this shootout including the the stupid move by the shooter, close gun to gun distances and number of shots fired, I wouldn&#39;t have believed it.
Over weed lol, the cops were thirsty for a blunt.
We named a city park after a cop that was killed in a marijuana bust gone wrong. Now weed is legal. I smoke weed in the park.
Now why would he do that?
Cop is shot because he stopped firing before threat was stopped.
people who have authority taken, have none, that is why they kill people for laws
Pot is not worth dying for!!  Make it legal!!!
These are cartoons for adults.

serves cop right cause they like to play with guns

Smh he was stupid for doing that smh
Cops really need better training. They almost lost their lives not checking the area first. They walked right past the gunner. What if gunner was faster. A cop would be dead now and over what?
first 30 seconds of this footage is like erhmmm what a lovely day,  last actually

If you die in your sins and you will go to hell after there you will be casted alive into the LAKE of FIRE to live and burn in torments and GREAT HEAT FIRE BRIMSTONE FOREVER AND EVER SCREAMING AND BURNING SCREAMING AND BURNING IN GREAT TORMENTS!

I think that last bullet made him drop his gun finally, respect for men and women in blue who risk life to stop the baddies
With right training,this guy should have taken 2 of them down and wounded a 3rd.,criminal or cop training making a big difference
