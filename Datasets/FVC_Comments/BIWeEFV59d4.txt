Could he not jump from the plane?
Fake but cool. Kobe’s bad acting was another clear giveaway.
Legend
R.I.P Black Mamba respect forever
When you didn’t even expose anything clickbait face ass 🤣🤣
My-man!
Amigo Kobe 🥺🥺😢😢
❤❤❤
Rest In Peace Mamba Out.
“Ha Ha told you!”<br><br>Rest In Peace Mamba 😢
Rest In Peace Kobe even though this actually fake
Imagine that car hit him,that would’ve been the end of Kobe’s <a href="http://career.rip/">career.rip</a> mamba
Let’s see Tom Cruise try that! <br>Damn Kobe had quite a pair! 💪🏾
I had a Hyper Color t-shirt, when my body temp changed , boom! So did my shirt.  <br><br>Hyper Color beayatchs.
Rest In KOBE the legend
galivanting in helicopters and jumping over speeding cars... what a shock
phake
&quot;Kobe exposed&quot; -🤓
Not all heroes wear capes 😔
Legend legend legend
That jump would probably clear most suvs😳
You can&#39;t fight fate🤔
If only he would&#39;ve jumped off the ✈️ like that  rip legend
R.i.p.
What really happened to Kobe is still a mystery. Accidents don&#39;t just happen to the rich and famous.
RIP Black Mamba. This was return to glory after being chastised by the media for being selfish and blaming him for Shaq leaving.
Fake Or Not He Could’ve Cleared It
Too bad he couldn&#39;t jump that mountain
R.I.P KOBE BUT THE VIDEO IS FAKE
Billy 🐐
One Of The Most Unbelievable Things About Me Is Than Kobe Bryant Passed Away One Year Before My Dear Beloved Mother (Who Passed Away Last Year On February) Mennnnn! God Taken My Dear &amp; Beloved Mother &amp; One Of My Childhood Idols!<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23godblessallinheaven">#GodBlessAllInHeaven</a>
Lebron never did this
Do you trust ya boy?<br>Rest In Peace<br>The greatest of all time<br>Kobe
Why is not a single person talkin about that this is fake lol
suprised this ain what took bro out 😂
This was faked but he did jump high enough
almost certain this was filmed in vancouver
Ronny!!!!
Was it real?
Man, I remember i was in high school when i seen this and i can’t count how many guys at my school tried this and failed miserably, hahaha rip Kobe Bryant <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23blaccmamba">#BlaccMamba</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lakerlegend">#LakerLegend</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23goat">#Goat</a>
Look like Ronny Turiaf
Too bad he couldn’t jump out of a helicopter
Rip Kobe💯
rip kobe bryant
i remember this fake video! its oldy but still a fakey.🙂
Oh Kobe, if only you had jumped over that mountain. 😔
When this came out everyone tried to say it was fake i was so weak minded i would let others think for me sometimes but looking back theres no way it was fake and no other pro athlete would ever try this
13 years ago we all miss you kobe
God bless that man.
Damn real beast ishhh
Dam that was amazing.!!Not only does he have to jump high but the exact timing is crucial to not get hit.. As a kid I used to jump over parked cars rollong down a hill on a skateboard.Jumping over and hoping to catch the board rolling under the car coming out on the other side Sometime me sbd friends would crash..But when you&#39;re 17 and 18 and 19 you think you&#39;re invincible.<br> But that was awsome strength and great timing.Kobe had secret Ninja skills! Lol🌟
I remember watching this for the first time
.i.
An African dude tried to do this recently. It didn&#39;t work. R.I.P Mamba and Gigi
That’s not how you jump over a car.  That’s how a car drives underneath you
Lost a true baller. The circle of life and we keep moving forward.
The videos technically fake. Because he jumped from the side not in front of it. It was on sport science. Still cool though, but he wasn’t ballsy enough to actually jump in front of it
haters will say it’s fake
He acts like it&#39;s the shoes lol
I love you Kobe. RIP 🙏 FOREVER
anybody came here after the african guy video?
He’s in the clouds now, hopefully with no hidden mountains.
I just saw a guy try this and bust his ass 🤣
I tried this and died.
First time I ever saw this 😱😱😳😳... Freaking awesome
I trust my boy
yall are so dumb. hes on the side of the car lmao
This isn&#39;t real. So don&#39;t do this.
Just think if he got hit by that car he might be alive today...but then nobody would care. XD
March 21st 2008 was the 81st day of 2008. Just like how Kobe scoring 81 in his 666th game.<br><br>Learn gematria.
Even tho this was really stupid that he did. R.I.P
Ronny Turiaf one of the best lakers all<br>Time
It breaks my heart knowing that its been 2 years since this legend passed 💔🙏🏾
RIP legend
Kobe Bryant, you will be missed.
Rest Easy Kobe Bryant! How sad 😞
I just randomly thought of this and came here. So fucking cool.
RIP 🪦
Rip the mamba
!!!!!!!!#24.2. Kobe an Iron Mike the Goats too me. Jbg

I got this
Kobe the NBA Legend
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWeEFV59d4&amp;t=36">0:36</a> Wow
The car was in front of him so if you think about it he would have had to have jumped even higher than he would have had too, in order to actually jump the car for real. This would be to maintain the illusion he was really jumping it while filming the shot from the side as he did. Must have been his way of letting us all know he was a bit of a mysterious thinker as well as a great basketball player. At least thats how i see him. Dude was smart as hell. Kind of godly some people would say, in his abilities. And now he and his lost family are with God in peace i believe. Rip
R.i.p. Kobe 🏀
Kobe will forever be in out hearts

Haters gonna hate

Was That Ronny Turiaf?
This is one of the first things I thought of when I heard Kobe had died. Shit doesn&#39;t even seem real and at the same time, I can&#39;t even see Kobe as a grizzled old dude. He was a true anomaly, a transcendent human
RIP KOBE MAMABA 4 EVER MAXIMOS RESPETOS
💜💛💜💛💜💛
R.I.P🙏
You guys are crazy, he didn&#39;t actually jump over the car, it was a marketing scheme. The car actually drove beside him.
I remember this when i was a kid rip kobe legend rite here kobe was always fly like an eagle
Rest in Peace Kobe Bryant and Gigi
Rest In Peace

Legend rip
R.I.P 🙏
i cannot reconcile a man doing this and still be a person that passed away. i still keep telling responding to the news of his death as though it was only a setback for him and not an end. like, &quot;Kobe died? oh ok, so we&#39;ll see him in a few months after he recovers right?&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ve seen him come back from worse, he&#39;ll be alright&quot; and i tell myself these things in the fantasized hope that this cant be the end of a person as resilient as him.
Why this sounds like something he’ll do 😂😂😂
Ayy , in beginning of Video are those His first Shoe!?
The best youtube recommendation.

I was 10 years old when I watched this man. I didn’t watch basketball but I knew who Kobe Bryant was. RIP Mamba, his daughter and all others on board. It’s surreal to lose a figure like him.

Now try a truck
My dumb ass used to think this was real
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWeEFV59d4&amp;t=35">0:35</a> thank me later
Two for one Advertisement. Nike and Aston Martin.
Here before it blows yp
That&#39;s a small ass car. My sister could jump over that 😂😂
My boy dom still believes Kobe did this till this day😂😂 I don&#39;t want tell him it ain&#39;t real he might start thinking Santa ain&#39;t real🤣🤣🤣
There was noone driving it
Brian scalabrine does this in a daily basis. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23whitemamba">#WhiteMamba</a>
Don&#39;t try this at home<br>Me:your not my dad
Not only is no one driving the car, but the wheels aren&#39;t moving.
Sprewell
Happy birthday, Kobe!
I jumped over a school bus yesterday, very easy.
2019 anyone?
real or fake
I put this on 140 p and told my bro it was me
Now imagine if it was real and he ended up breaking his legs and never being able to compete again 🤔
Легенда!
Got to get those sneakers  they life  savers
Holy shit
This car don&#39;t even have driver. Kobe can use his mind to speed a car up to 55mph and jump over it wow.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWeEFV59d4&amp;t=35">0:35</a><br>Car: James Charles<br>Him: Straight men
And then lost in the finals that same year
He got hang time.
Who’s here in 2019😢
Green screen
Dammmn Geeeeenaaa...
It&#39;s obviously fake. The car drove by right next to him. Pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWeEFV59d4&amp;t=35">0:35</a> when his feet are on the ground and the car enters the frame.
Nggas really forgot about this
That was the start of Kobe Bryant&#39;s crime fighting career.
Thats fake
Don&#39;t try this at home ok I&#39;ll try it at Walmart
you have you super jumps i have the jumps i tried it i did it i still do it
I tried this at with editing software
Typically I wouldn&#39;t have a car in my house so I couldn&#39;t really try it at home.
Kobe Bryant got a good vertical wow impressive
how was the car driving on its own ;-;
That was so fake
It&#39;s fake. They superimposed Kobe&#39;s face into the body of someone who jumped over a car. My father used to be an engineer for a voice over audio recording company.
you can tell it&#39;s fake if you put it to .25 speed and go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWeEFV59d4&amp;t=35">0:35</a>. you can see the shadow abruptly transform unnaturally.
damn forgot how fake this looked
Can’t wait to do the same thing at home
His contract wouldn&#39;t allow him to do anything this risky also the quick little pause before he lands back on the ground was edited so it&#39;s fake
This is fake
That gone viral
Classic
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fake">#Fake</a>
I got this
Boi
Absolutely fake
If you look at Kobe’s shadow and the cars shadow just as it closes in on him, you can see if it is fake, then they did a pretty good job covering it up
This was fake
good editing skills right there!
This is fake
Nigga why you lying? Why you always lying? Oooo why you lying? Why you always lying?
Aston Marton are low
The car was speeding next to kobe..
Is this fake??????????
You say that&#39;s amazing but Logan Paul jumped over to speeding Lamborghinis
Well, at least we know he won&#39;t be ran over
anyone else watching this after his jersey retirements?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWeEFV59d4&amp;t=30">0:30</a> is the jump
No he just drove the Aston Martin on the side of him and jumped making the illusion that he jumped over it.
You just down see enough players doing this stuff now a days
Fake
FAKE<br>Well u are a  good editor
WWJD? Boiii Wow.
A kid from my school died from doing this, you don&#39;t believe me look up Kobe Thomas
People are so stupid when they say it&#39;s photoshopped. He jumped next to the car and created an optical illusion. If you slow it down you can tell that the tires are behind his feet.
everyone listen up this is possible but not in this day and age, but soon there will be someone that can jump and stay that long in the air
ive been a kobe fan since 1996, i argue thats hes the goat every day, but this is &quot;fake and gay&quot;
fake
God damn
Actually it&#39;s possible, but risky the Aston need to keep 62mph.. Then If u think to jump when the Aston is at exactly 13 m, u ll start to jump when the Aston is at 7m, it lets u enough time to jump over safely. Do the perfect timing and everything gonna be alright, fail and u re dead.
Kobe I really want to meet you, you are the best  NBA player ever and I can beat you
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fake">#fake</a>
its fake you can look it up
fake totally fake
can you try me ot come over to my house on Saturday
I GOT THIS!!!
He&#39;s stood to the side of the car!
9 years ago 😭😭😭
It&#39;s fake are u guys dat dum to not know dat
Fake
Holy... Can you believe it???!!!
we all know that the truth is that the car jumped over him
fake
fake
Am I the only one in the entire planet that realized this is fake
Fake
fake wires
is this real or not
They forgot about the shadow of the crane...
FAKE!!!!!
This is so fake
fake
he really jumped that high but the car drove next to him instead of towards him
It&#39;s fake
guys its fake they edited the rope the pull him up no one can do it
fake asf
KOBES MY FAVORITE
Fake
Fakeeeeeeeeeeeee
Where can I get those shoes in 2017??
Fake
Fake
Haha told ya
I think it would be possible to jump over a Ford GT40 because it&#39;s around 40 inches tall and if you have a 40&quot; vertical. But you may not be able to hold the jump for too long.
Kobe is a bad ass gangster
It was actually fake
Play it in 0.25 looks legit but idk? lol
There was no driver
It&#39;s actually fake
marketing wizard
Why is it dangerous to use editing software to make it look like I jumped over a car at home?
Soooo....some kid just tried this and died? sad....
fake
is funny how Kobe said do not try thisss! and some guy named Kobe Thomas try did and is died
Really stupid and a horrible example!  Go find something worthwhile to do and promote Kobe!  Kids imitate you.  One did in metro Atlanta the other day and died.
A 16 year old was killed where I live trying this. Just because someone is dumb enough to try this doesn&#39;t mean anybody else should.
it looks fake
Sprewell!
he can jump over that car cause it was soo low guys common
Somewhere, some idiot tried this for real, and got themselves busted the hell up
even if Kobe could really jump over a car, do you really think he would be dumb enough to actually try it on camera? as if common sense didn&#39;t tell you it&#39;s fake, wouldn&#39;t Kobe&#39;s name checking of the shoe tell you right there that it&#39;s fake?
no one drives the car if you pause you will see that.
This shits fake
just look at how he looks when he lands
hey all, my buddy had some good results with theSoaringBaller programme (just google it). Was pretty impressive seeing his results...
Real. But on another note, love how concern Cuz was! He didn&#39;t have faith in his Boi Kobe.
IG brought me here. At first I thought it was fake but came the conclusion that it&#39;s real AF. Cmon now, it&#39;s Kobe Bryant for god sake! That boi had hops and he don&#39;t need to front.
no shadow on the car its photoshop
The crazy thing is he could probably do that in his prime
Real
Fake
Faze blazikens vid
Fake
fake but he coulda landed it
its fake sports science said it to there is a crane above him
fake
He jumped at the side of the car
Still my fav
Haters will say it&#39;s fake
No body driving
Fake noone drove the car
No one was driving that car
Shit is real lmao
I love you
That jump Doe
That was crazy
I still don&#39;t know if this was real
Imagine he failed the jump
it was fake look at sports science
No wonder America is in the ditch.
this is so fake... no one is driving the goddamn car😂 pause and play it real quick a few times when the car goes by
Is that Ronnie Turiaf?
It&#39;s not the hops that&#39;s hard it&#39;s only a 48 inch box jump the hard part is the timing it needs to be perfect
Everyone knows it was fake even back then. Unless you&#39;re idiot.
Hahaha
So fake<br>
mad fake..
fake more than santaclaus
no way how how how did he do that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kobe is a fake bitch ass nigga
&quot;Asstin Martin&quot; Lmfao
Fake
I can jump over a go kart so I guess it works
Kobe Bryant has the balls to do this
Now I want to see him jump a Range Rover
S/O Blake Griffin
I Bet All Of You Still Believe On Santa Claus!!!!!
THIS IS SO FAKE IF YOU DON&#39;T BELIVE ME GO TO SPORT SCIENCE JUMP KOBE JUMPS!
Holy shizz dat jump doe.
he is standing by the shadow of mic boom and the car&#39;s passenger wheel runs into the shadow also,  he is in fact, in front on the vehicle
<a href="https://instagram.com/p/6ta53hDBs4/This">https://instagram.com/p/6ta53hDBs4/This</a> can pretty live Aswell you act like people can&#39;t jump that high. Sports cars are low
Kobe FAKE bRYANT
Is this a stunt for Nike shoes or what?
Most of us know the car was beside him. To be more technical, the car actually swerved around him. Play it at .25 the speed.
speed it up to 2
Does anyone know what nike model is that tracksuit kobe is wearing and where to get one? Thanks in advance!
fake
FAKEEEEEEEE MODDAFUKKAAAAAAA
Ok people I can solve this. pause it a 31 seconds. look at the boom mic shadow then look at Kobes left foot. His left foot is placed on the shadow at the last second he moves to his right just outside of the shadow. Now pause it at 35 seconds the Aston Martin runs over the boom mic shadow. The Aston Martin is 70 inches wide. Kobe did jump over the middle of the car. Case closed.
People act like this isn&#39;t real and th st people that hadn&#39;t jumped when he jumps the car comes flying through in enough  time for him to jump and the cad to go right by mom problem!!! Its real if you know how to jump and imagine kobes  athletic abilities boom jump its over 😉😉☺😊😊😀😃😄
cool
36 seconds pause it. He&#39;s to high for only 38&quot; vertical. They had a crane in the shadows that lifted him<br><br><br>       THIS IS KOBIES WAY OF SHOWING OFF LMAOS
The background looks so stiff
he stood beside it.Disclaimer:They Are Doing it in a horizantal way of recording him rlly obvious or just edit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWeEFV59d4&amp;t=36">0:36</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWeEFV59d4&amp;t=37">0:37</a> he jumped way high for a human and look how he landed
It&#39;s fake but he could have done it. He&#39;s way too valuable to be allowed to risk himself like that though.
Watch espn sports science, its 100% guaranteed fake. They&#39;ll show you how they created the illusion. Its confirmed impossible for any human being in the world to try this and succeed. 
Pause at :35 , his feet dont line up with the tires, hes slightly closer toward the camera then the car. Fake.
Kobe is obviously right beside the car to trick u and he&#39;s not jumping over it
Kobe
Michael Jordan could technically do it
He stood beside the car so obvious
this is fucking fake aright
I think the car was at 50-60 mph<br>
Fake shit 
It&#39;s real cause there are shadows of them
Fake<br>
Everyone arguing about is it fake or not, Of course it&#39;s fake Kobe even said &quot;It&#39;s movie magic&quot; AKA Fake
That was fake!
Stupid brains on Internet. Saying this is fake..guys don&#39;t even bother  having argument with these hyper silly traits..
Why the camera don&#39;t move? this is fake and a shame. check this guy, is REAL not a fake like this ass hole <a href="http://lockerdome.com/tre/6170042811288129/7003530238111508">http://lockerdome.com/tre/6170042811288129/7003530238111508</a>
he said do not try this at home! now how the hell u gonna jump a car at home dumbass
fake
I got hyperdunks and later that day I tried it, I&#39;m in the hospital now
Go to Andrew Wiggins bio steel commercial he jumps over a bugatti ... $ick !!!
No,it is POSSIBLE!<br>Firstly,it depends on the speed. If the car is going at least 40mph,he can jump over it.<br>Secondly,it depends on your jumping height. If you can jump high,you will make it by no doubts.<br>Thirdly,and most important thing,the timing. One second too early or too late can become brutal when you jump off the ground.
It&#39;s a green screen. If you pay attention to his shadow, you will see that it was a generated background. His shadow was on the car, wouldn&#39;t be the case if he actually jumped the car.
Don&#39;t know how they did it but it is fake.  Stop the film when the car is in the frame.  The shadow of the light stays under the car and does not go up to the side of the car.  Still impressive shot if no kids think it is real and try it for themselves.
Best kobe shoes ever
You say don&#39;t do this yet ther is a million people who tried
The people the keep saying it&#39;s fake, who are you trying to convince, the public or yourself?
Calm down guys, it&#39;s fake. Sports Science proved this is impossible
What&#39;s turiaf doing there lol
everyone should know this is fake. it&#39;s a traditional camera trick
awesome
I know his sports agent had a heart attack :) Ronny Turiaf is pumped up about it.
Commercial for nike
the video is fake 
Its not fake Kobe haters.
This jump ain&#39;t shit. 
You can see his shadow on the side of the car 
Dam
its all fake. what he did is time everything. he doesnt need any wires because he can already jump high enough.
Pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWeEFV59d4&amp;t=35">00:35</a> no driver
I thought that this was real until I saw the sports science 
No one is driving the car
Fake..
IT look fake but its not
Why do people hate Kobe he a really good basketball player
fake
972 reasons not to try this at home
The background and the shadows are fake 
Wat a hater that sport science is to Kobe. He did it. Yes he has done it.leave it alone
He did it, but now as today of course he can&#39;t. 
My teachers sister made this vid he told me today
It&#39;s actually fake, a jump like that would void his contract with the lakers. It&#39;s a good commercial nonetheless.
I&#39;m not saying this is impossible, I&#39;ve seen people doing this before but this one is fake. Just look at the guy when he jumps
they edited two videos together, one of kobe jumping and one of the aston martin going by. otherwise the camera wouldnt be on a STAND looking at a straight on side angle if he was just with his friends, someone would just be holding it. plus the jump looks super unnatural, i cant believe people think this is real, its an advertisement for hyperdunks
he was on the side of the car, but if he wanted to, he couldve jumped over it
fake
Its fake he didn&#39;t jump over it lmfao
Amaazzzingggg!!!!
So that&#39;s how he got injured......
Eventually TopGear copied Kobe&#39;s idea. A free-runner jumping over a Lamborghini
fake and gay
fake
Kobe was acting like a white dude doning all dat crazy stuff
notice how the background is the same, no clouds, nothing moving, no window glints, nothing
Google Bladimir Barreto if you want to see what happens when someone else tries this.
OMG
Can I try it at school instead? 
that green screen though
fake there is a video that proved it is fake
real
I tried this at home hyper dunks don&#39;t do shit
This is fake there is a video on it.
This isn&#39;t real I saw it in sport science and they said it was fake
I tried this at home you were right tho
@Max Gonazelles stop hating bitch like you can do it and ion een like kobe.
This is fake. He used a crane and cable.
What they probably did is shot the car and the jump in two shots then combined them. So yes he technically can jump over a car, but he probably didn&#39;t actually do it.
Come on Kobe. Saying don&#39;t try this at home makes people try it more.
Guys this is real because he&#39;s basket ball player they jump high as hell
&quot;Dont try this at home&quot;Don&#39;t tell me what to do...
Looks like he can do it but the video looks fake
Its real
You can see the shadow of the crane that holds the wires 
on strings
lol look at these white people callin this fake we black we got hops dudes if we can jump a fince that&#39;s like 5 ft we can jump over a car if your tall like kobe 
FAKE !
Cool
Ahahaa. I know this is cool, but it&#39;s fake. His feet on the highest point of his jump has an unrealistic movement to it before going down. Usually, your feet adjusts to the thing that it thinks it&#39;s going to land on, in this video, there was nothing like that and you can see the blur between the feet and the car as they pass each other.
Fake!! Look up sports science kobe jumps over car
Cant jump iver my gtr...too big .........
I did it at home a and I broke  my arm left one good thing i am right handed
fuck it im gonna try it
Mabe kobe put helium in his shoe hahahaha
He makes it look so easy
He made Blake Look Like A BITCH
That is how you do it Blake Griffin
ya this hella fake
I wonder how much he got sued for breach of contract...
Like I have a car in my home...
thats just dumb, sorry! too many wannabe cool kids are gonna try the same and probably end up with broken legs or even dead!
turiaf&#39;s jump is better U.U
Fake
why cant i comment on other peoples comments? <br>whats wrong with you youtube?
best comment ever!

DONT DO IT FOR THE VINE

THAT IS HOW YOU JUMP OVA AN ASTON MARTIN BOI THATS HOW YOU DO IT! HYPERDUNKS! DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME
he&#39;s so damn cocky...gotta love him tho!
Jackass jumped over a lambo first so.....
ehh chuck norris is better

Chuck noris doesn&#39;t jump he stands

I know man it&#39;s so annoying
I bet Nate Robinson would jump over a truck 
Yeah sure, many things look fake. But it isn&#39;t. 
did you hear that vine boy? &quot;don&#39;t try this at home&quot; 
its real im a laker fan too but I hated this video dumbest shit ever to risk ur career like that 
its just when he is in the air it looks fake 
Im a editor and I make short films and people getting thrown out of windows and stuff, and this is not fake. It looks impossible, but there was no editing used for this video
LeBron james with braids...
Kobe definitely sounds more sophisticated now
this lookks fake
I&#39;m for gun free zones.  As a matter of fact... Phil... Could you have your crack reporting team do some flow up and see how many people have actually been saved because they  carried a fire arm?
Learn how to pass the ball instead.
FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE!

lol srsly
Midgets are creepy as fuck.

i dont even own a aston martin

Who came here from that guy on vine attempting to do this? 
FAKEEEEEEEEEEE

oh my fucking god !! this is so fucking true xD
king 

kobe is g
I watched the midget too first. lol. 
im here for the same reason xD

its gotta be the shoes
Pause it when hes in the air and the whole back will look fake!!
Its Fake , Sport Science Did An Episode On It
his jump is not fake, but the car was not heading on him! the caris like 10cm beside him but still he jumped higher than the car
that&#39;s dangerous, kobe.. fuck! that&#39;s awesome.
nike 
Lebron fans dislikes 9 27 times
If you look closely, the shadow of Kobe is on the car. So he jumped next to the car, not higher in front ^^
It&#39;s possible, but he&#39;d have to time that perfectly, and the driver would have to be going a precise speed and trajectory. It&#39;s just way too high of a risk and low of a reward for anyone to try it, though. But I do know for a fact that the Kobe jumps are fake. No biggie though, they&#39;re just commercials.
Relax, it&#39;s just a Nike advertisement. But yes, the Kobe jumps are fake, I know this for a fact and I don&#39;t even have to watch them. 
maybe an advertisement for nike? thats why he&#39;s showing off his nike shoe on the start of the video. anyone? 
BRASIL
you can&#39;t tell that
maybe he got so high because of some computer effects
Vine dan gelenler like :D

Even if it is fake
He still gets over the car 
That vertical was real
It&#39;s fake but I think he could do it. You see how high he got
Guys stop video 0:35 and you gonna see that Aston Martin Far left from Kobe. I&#39;m not Kobe&#39;s hater but this video is fake..
0:35 right when he jumps!!!
Do not try this at home ? Fuck.. but i wanna jump over an aston martin in my bedroom...
Kobe, how can you try this stunt at home??

Like if you&#39;re here from the midget vine
