I’m on holidays here right now. Gonna see some sharks
happy  vacations
Why the tense music?? The sharks are in their home. THEIR home. They have every right to be there.
Nice Hurley hope Finn well
And to think my grandparents used to regularly take me to fingal bay, shoal bay and hawks nest as a kid and let me swim out there by myself 😮🤭
Yeah the mullet run there. When all the fisho scabs come out. Chisolm and all that.
Weird to think I used to surf here as a teenager on my own after watching this
I grew up at Shoal Bay and Fingal was just another of my local beaches. It is, or Used to be, a beautiful long stretch of mostly deserted beach. We occasionally rode our horses along this beach and took them in swimming. Not as far up the beach as shown in this video but further south near the village. <br>The Bay was a wonderful place to grow up in the 60s and 70s.
how come no ones swimming
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXLge_iRblk&amp;t=180">3:00</a> looks like a 4 year old playing with his life with no parent around
I have been to that the beach before😱and did u get a fine for flying in restricted airspace as one of my mates has
Those are saltwater mullet and grey nurse sharks
They just look like grey  nurses  to me
2 guys watching from way over back is smartest.

Could you tell what kind of sharks were captured in this footage?
Ohne Worte.....
WOW
Wow! Beautiful footage! Thanks for sharing :)
There&#39;s a reason the island off Fingal Bay is called Shark Island!
wow, that was incredible footage, some of those sharks were so close to the shore...ugh!
welcome to Australia
i hate shark/ich hasse haie
...canibals at the beach...
Better cull the sharks because the humans can&#39;t swim in the sharks natural habitat....sadly morons actually believe this.
THE OCEAN IS SHARKS &#39;S PLACE... JUST GET OUT OF HERE!!!<br>LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!<br>HUMANS are too stupid...smth?
It&#39;s worrying that the Sharks are so close to the shore
My friend Joel was threre at the time he told me about this
Und die Menschen stehen so lässig am Strand und warten auf die Haie alles klar läuft bei denen😂
Boah, wie kann mann seine Kinder einfach so frei herumlaufen lassen bei so einen Anblick!
thats a lot of fish
shark lives matter
Guess I found the video you were telling me about Mr Hurley.
This was awesome. We spent a couple of hours down there just entranced by the sharks &amp; the swirling fish. You can catch us right at the end, with my little boy digging a shark trap in the sand ...
I&#39;m more surprised of the fish near the shore than the sharks.
Just put mick Fanning out there and they&#39;ll be gone in no time.
Bulls?
I see the annual Shark Herding Trials have started at Fingal this year.  My money is on <i>Fluffy</i> to win. What&#39;s the name of the shark you think will win?
These are fairly harmless and extremely beautiful Grey Nurse sharks. The one&#39;s to watch out for are Bronze Whalers, Hammerheads and White Pointers when they are hungry they are very aggressive. This couldn&#39;t have been filmed in Asia because if it was it all the people would have jumped in and grabbed all the fish and sharks and eaten them in shark fin soup!
Sharks are just awesome creatures, great drone shots too 👍
I WAS THERE THAT WEEK I DIDN&#39;T EVEN REALISE THERE WERE THAT MANY!!!!😱
why its red
Der Hai zum anderen Hai<br><br><br><br><br><br>Deez Nuts
OMG Mr Hurley, you&#39;re trending
Hold my beer and give me a fishin rod
Someone should&#39;ve jumped in and wet swimming jk I&#39;ve experienced plenty of shark attacks where I live in SA
song titel?
Nothing compared to what I&#39;ve seen during the annual sardine run along the eastern coast of South Africa.
I was actually camping at Fingal bay caravan park during April. I was scrolling through trending and found this. So the beaches weren&#39;t shut for a reason
Y u no play jaws music?
i loved this!!!!!! &lt;3 sharks :P :P :P :O<br>fish are proably the best living specie, because they are literally eating our rubbish but stil living :o how sad. :( good on the people watching this at the beach tho, exciting times!!!!
The sharks are like the smelly kids .  Gretchen Weiner: &quot;You cant swim with us&quot;
1st words that come out from me .. &quot;ohhh sh*<b>**</b> that is so close ..&quot;
I was there when it happened
I was standing on the beach watching the shark fins poke out of the water... Amazing!
so scary. never seen this before
cooles Video.  fand die Musik auch passend
BEAUTIFUL!!
Fuckin Hell Sharks in Oz are full on at the moment 😲 i can&#39;t believe the way they come up to the shore like that 😨 it&#39;s not safe to swim anywhere atm.. awesome footage by the way 👍

I&#39;ve swum there more times than I care to remember
https://youtu.be/-W8r_rz7whQ
Been there many times......Fingal beach
What&#39;s the name of the soundtrack?
Dürfen Haie keinen Urlaub am strand machen?
Great video haie are beautiful but also dangerous animals
I feel a great amount of pride that my country is always somehow on trending
The beach is Fingal Bay which is in the Port Stephens area of N.S.W. AUSTRALIA and it was once not so long ago a beautiful quite holiday corner of  Port Stephens but now has become a another over populated area of the n.s.w coastal areas, shark sightings are very rare and as a child we swam there all year round, it&#39;s now  a place of my childhood dreams.
The fish are mullet and around the Easter period it coincides with the annual mullet spawn which has taken place at Fingal Bay since the dawn of time, the shark&#39;s are Grey Nurse which are totally and completely harmless to man and you can swim with them but just like playing with puppies you may get accidentally superficially bitten, the shark&#39;s are now arriving because the local fisherman no longer net the mullet because of government regulations, as a child i would see the fish boats been launched from the beach, but the mullet harvest like all things is a thing of the past.
Awesome. You posting any more footage?
Nice footage Damian, thanks. What size are they? lt&#39;s hard to tell without something to compare against.<br>It&#39;s clearly a beach that sharks frequent for the mullet - there are hundreds of videos on here of the same place. <br>No need to freak out and start demanding shark culls. They&#39;re just doing what sharks do. Shark attacks on humans only happen rarely, and experts believe it&#39;s because they mistake us for food. (That&#39;s why 98% are surfers - human limbs dangling from a surfboard look like a big fat seal from below.)<br>Just enjoy the footage, respect our oceans and ALL that lives there, and take the time to find out about the tides and fish flows where you want to swim. lf the signs say dont swim - dont swim. <br>(Especially in Australia - that country has a gazillion ways to kill you &amp; hide the body 😉 I can say that, l&#39;m in NZ.)
am I the only one that wants to swim in after the sharks?
This is the proof that the seas are not overfished! Global Warmings is not real you left idiots
Dieses Verantwortungsbewusstsein der Eltern, Alter, ich hatte die ganze Zeit Angst, dass n Kind ins Wasser läuft/fällt und die Eltern chillen da einfach 5m weiter hintern.
wenn es ein tornado geben wird sind wir alle gefickt.
ok. 5-6 sharks but THESE FISH DAAAAAMN HOW MANY ARE THERE?!?!?!
holy shit the jumpscare at the end really got me....
who though that are coralls and no Fish 😂
Ok jetzt ist es fix. Das kann doch nur duch in Österreich Ansätzige Likebotfirmen in den Trends hier sein, oder??
So there were sharks in the water. Thats outrageous.
Sharknado
&quot;We&#39;re gonna need a bigger beach!&quot;
the amount of fish around all these sharks blows my mind !

Besser als Apored
Wie schön
Um Platz 1 in den Deutschen Trends zu sein muss man zu fake McDonalds gehen.
Amazing!

&quot;Baby there&#39;s a shark in the water&quot;🎶

such a nice beach....and you can&#39;t swim...😢😭😭😭
Hi Damian, we would like to show some of your amazing shots on German Television ZDF at heuteplus News (TV and web). We would be glad, if you&#39;d give us permission and get back to me via Email: burkhardt.g@zdf.de Kind regards from Germany Gregor Burkhardt
is noone talking about those other fish roaming that close to the beach?<br>i cannot say i&#39;ve seen it before - after all, humans are rather unpleasant swimming companions
This has been posted in a German newspaper: <a href="http://www.ksta.de/panorama/drohnen-video-haie-jagen-nah-an-australischer-kueste-26754912">http://www.ksta.de/panorama/drohnen-video-haie-jagen-nah-an-australischer-kueste-26754912</a>.
This is AMAZING!!
Hello, I work for Reuters news agency. How are you? Could you please email me at mengchen.li@thomsonreuters.com if you filmed this video? Many thanks!
Hello Damian, this is amazing! My name is Antia and I work at Newsflare - a leading video marketplace. We specialise in distributing videos to news organisations and production companies. We&#39;re interested in working with your video. Please can you get back to me at antia.xeada@newsflare.com and we can discuss this further. Thanks!
There was a man and boy fishing, those mullet are not thinking about food right now.
Great video. Shows also another thing: Adults stand in safe distance while they let their kids run around in the water as the sharks approach. No comment ...
Hey Damian... this is an incredible video. i&#39;ve sent you a private facebook message, could you take a look at it?
One day sharks will walk on Land and then we will all be fucked....
