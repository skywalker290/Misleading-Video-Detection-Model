Every earthquake there is no chance that someone wouldn&#39;t run
These video is good for training.
Lived in fear for a whole year after this happened to us

Kind of funny how everyone just runs like hell like a chicken without a head.
A normal Saturday turn into most hatest day

Karma ellos maltratan a los elefantes
These guys have proper knowledge what to do at time of earthquake, move towards open space and join hands together
This video again made me remember that terrible day. Thank god it was Saturday holiday otherwise in school i could not judge what to do. If it was not a holiday the earthquake could do more disaster. I was is santinagar. There are no footage of santinagar, there a van was coming and the santinagar gate directly fell over that van and all the people inside that van died on the spot and i was  there only.
Damn Crazy
Something how they all knew to get out of buildings into the <a href="http://street.in/">street.in</a> case buildings colapse

How big was this earthquake
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=112">1:52</a>, nothing happened to the statue,im astonished
Why are all the earthquake related videos comming up the recommendation. Is earthquake the new disaster of April? 🤔🤔🤔
Within a second several lives were gone.
This was also my first experience of earthquake in Lucknow India, 350 km West  of Nepal.<br>For 1st 20 seconds didn&#39;t knew f**k what was happening, my bed shaking i thought i was making it shake. Then realised grabbed the pillow and went to road. <br>After that for atleast 3-4 months i would wake in middle of sleep imagining that i am vibrating and half awaken would run out in open.

I love it when people run together during a quake
Ya Allah khair
Really scary especially since brick wall fly way far from the building, no such safe place in the middle of the street
I was in nepal in 2017 after this earthquake,,,,,the whole city is in slanting position i could not find a single house in straight  balanced position,,,,,,
Its been four years but it still feels like it happened yesterday :(
Gave me goosebumbps and she&#39;d tears for the humanity this people showed in times of disaster.
Good idea to get out in the open so there&#39;s less chance of something falling on you.  Looks like that&#39;s what people are instructed to do.
https://youtu.be/wiWGPKBZAhc the BIG ONE Philippines earthquake!
News  reports  have  trickled  down  to  say  that  on  24  April  ,  2019  ,   North  Eastern  States  of  Assam  and  Arunachal  Pradesh  in  India  and  Kathmandu  in  Nepal  were  jolted  by  strong  earthquakes.  While  Kathmandu   and  some  other  regions  of  Nepal  are  reported  to  have  been  jolted  by  three  strong  earthquakes  of  5.2  magnitude  or  somewhat  below  ,  Arunachal-Assam  had  6.1  magnitude  jolts.  The  residents  in  the  areas  visited  by  these  quakes  are  reported  to  have  come  out  of  their  houses  but  no  report  of  casualty  has  come.   Some  parts  of  U.P.  in  India  were  also  visited  by  quake  jolts.   Some  areas  of  Tibet  close  to  India   were  also  jolted. In  this  regard  ,  it  is  apt  to  mention  here  this  Vedic  astrology  writer’s  alert  for  more  care  and  appropriate  strategy  brought  to  public  domain  in  March  and  subsequently  on  5  April  ,  2019  through  article  -  “  World  Trends  During  April  to  August  2019” .    The  predictive  alert  had  said  that    China  ,  India  and  Nepal  may  also  take  more  care  and  appropriate   strategy  against  likely  earthquakes  during  a  period  of  four  and  a  half  months  from  mid  -April  to  August  ,  more  so  in  June  ,    in  present  year  2019.

Kuch nahi hai bas camera ko hila rhe he
i remember this. i was in school when it happened, i don&#39;t exactly remember what happened because i was young but my class and i were going to music class and just before we stepped through the doors, the earthquake started. we had to return to the outdoor lobby and stay there until it had stopped. most people were crying and we were eventually picked up by our parents.
Nepal Jesus Christ loves u all.... get him...
Great people<br><br>Respect from egypt
really sad....
Nepal what did thes time  everyone know? 10 thaugen + Cowe kill him.

Good to see most standing in the middle of the road. Safer place to stand.
This shows me all ppl will b United wen a problem occus to everyone like earthquake or tsunami etc...if problem  occur to one individual no one cares abt it...
I’m only here because we had to watch this in class and I started crying
Nepal is very beautiful country and good people too..salam from malaysia..
I was in the physics lab of my college at that time in Assam, India. I had to hold the table for that tremendous quake.
So they ran in the middle of the road to get away from the building? Hmmm 🤔 I see . Very good idea
Im glad I live in Arizona. No tornados, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or rain.

पृथ्वीकौक के समय मैं शौचालय में था। अचानक सब कुछ कांटा। मेरी पॉटी बंद हो गई। मैं इसे धोने के बिना भाग लूंगा। लेकिन मैं पॉटी से भरा था। सड़क पर शौचालय की तरफ से बाहर निकलने वाला टाइलर। मेरी तस्वीर लेने वाले सभी लोग।
I am an indian but I live there<br>It was sunday morning I was enjoying it by spending my time with my family. Than suddenly I experienced a earthquake I knew it was a earthquake but I didnt knew what to do. Than my mom grabbed my hand and we all went to the ground in front of our house. <br>I saw all my neighbours gathering there and we all sat there together in large number. I saw many people serving tea and foods to us. By seeing nepalis unity I got amazed! They helped everyone there. I got happy. We should learn something from  nepals unity in tough times. They help each other in tough times!
The first clip was a smart act by the Nepali people
i love how caring people are holding on to eachother
wow what a disaster
Dude that is one gnarly experience.
For me even seing the first clip was so new, and usefull!
So mush mash
Very nice!
The world was turning sideways
😟😢😭
every one is safe god gift
It&#39;s terrible
bahut bura
It reminds me of how helpless we &#39;little beings&#39; really are and how powerful God really is.... He cud destroy the universe in a second amd there&#39;s absolutely NOTHING we would be able to do.... Never let a moment go by without forgiving your brothers/sisters aswell as asking God for his forgiveness which is in Jesus Christ the Son... For we never know wen our last will be on d earth 🌎 God bless... Be strong 💪 always. LOVE 💘

POOR NEPAL! I AM FROM NEPAL :(
Dont wait till its to late for you, because Jesus Christ loves you very much repent of your sins and ask Jesus to come into your heart and save you! the bible says in romans chapter 10 vers 8-13 says if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God and it is by confessing with your mouth that YOU ARE SAVED
Amazing
I Think this Was from ksi disstrack
CHAOS IS STARTING
Why do they clump up like that?
God bless them but I would have been scream in the whole time because it is very rare to have an earthquake in Los Angles. Like the last one I had was in 2013. And it wasn&#39;t big but the earth did a full turn. And I do know how strong earthquakes are in Cali.
Me: Look at that big crack at One For- oh my phone is just broken
Is that guy in the bottom middle, brown jacket,  at @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=40">0:40</a> trying to appease the earthquake gods?

Earthquake in Nepal is a serious and dangerous for the people of the Nepal that indicates the life is not a safe any moment.
we reached on mars but we cannot predict 8km inside the damn  earth...how pity..
._.
Yeah... just stand in a doorway or hide under a table... right...
Don&#39;t come &#39;a knockin&#39; if Nepal is &#39;a rockin&#39;
Notice that there is not a single fat person in any of these videos?
This brings back memories of Christchurch 2011.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=25">0:25</a> is like: everybody get in line to win a free candy!

The title is &quot;Earthquake in Nepal.&quot; It could have been Bargain day on black Friday.
What is the purpose of this video? A voice over may have been helpful.

This is real
These people are clever 
Couldn&#39;t the street cave in?
I&#39;m grateful we weren&#39;t impacted like this by the recent Oklahoma earthquake also felt in Texas.
SOON in Oclahoma
Nepal is crazy
Wow thats amazing everyone just go out and helps  eatchothere to stand upp just if people always could be that helpfull and work togetehere that well
How the hell did those shit box buildings stay up!!
Makes you think, will these people believe? <br><br>Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 99 Surah Zilzaal verse 1-3: When the earth is shaken with her utmost shaking, and the earth casts out all the burden from within her, and man says, What has befallen her?.<br> <br>Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 22 Surah Hajj verse 1-2: O mankind, save yourseves from the Wrath of your Lord. The fact is that the earthquake of the Resurrection is a terrible thing. The Day you behold it, you will see that every suckling woman will forsake her suckling; and every pregnant female will cast her burden; and the people will appear to you in a drunken state, though they will not be drunk! But the torment of Allah will be so dreadful.<br> <br>The earthquakes that we experience in this world today are just a pre-runner to the earthquake of the end of time. The earthquakes are one of the signs of Allah and their coming are absolutely in Allahs control. Even with all the technology available in the world today, the geologists are not able to point out where and when is the next earthquake going to strike! Allah Alone knows where and when his adhaab is going to come.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=177">2:57</a> at the bottom left corner.. Cracks opened.
My respect to this people.
ALLAH is the greatest
Micheal bay?
Their traffic is crazy
Good  people and calmest one they didn&#39;t run they stopped and huddle!
Looked scary 
Smart people getting out their homes leaving the previous stuff for their lives many people wouldn&#39;t do the same they would get first the iPhone.... Then their iPads then they get out -.-
i thought i have broke my speakers and headphones
The first one, they are very clever! They hold themselves together and prevent falling
الله يستر عل اخون المسلمين وياحفض اليمن
wow they know what to do when earthquake comes
Don&#39;t they have any traffic rules or something wtf
Oh, so when an earth quake happens, you&#39;re supposed to jump in the middle of the road? Cuz those people in the front of the second clip seem to know immediately when they stop like &quot;yep, this is an earthquake&quot; to get away from the buildings. Guess that makes sense, though. I&#39;ll remember that
why do they all go together?
Wow their reactions were on point, well done Nepal.    I loved how you could tell how hard the earth was swaying because the groups of people were swaying as one with it.
The reaction of the people is impressive. Wow !!
Im so happy for this culture, look at them, they dont care who are they with, it&#39;s all when they get in to this and stay together to hold against this disaster, You rock Nepal
Strong earthquake
bra
I live in the UK, where there are no earthquakes, so I don&#39;t understand - why does everyone rush to the middle of the road when they feel it start?
and we think ourselves so great and powerful because we have figured out a few things.... we are ants
I&#39;m SO glad Iive in Australia.  becauses we rarely get any natural disasters. but sadly, other countries aren&#39;t so safe:(
allah is a great

These people have learned from their earthquake drills. GET AWAY FROM THE BUILDINGS!!!
Poor people :(
Look at down left corner at starting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=169">2:49</a> you can see the ground is cracking, holy crap
Woaah. I can see the ground just cracked in the third video. 😱
why get out of the cars?
Check out the moped rider at about 22 seconds.  He stops and looks down, thinking he has a  blown tire.
Those bastards deserved it
i helped for this poor country. we raised 10K dollars. I was a student parlement at my school. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23staystrongnepal">#staystrongnepal</a>
God is great, Merciful, Mighty and Powerful, It is he who reminds us be prepared for the hereafter, Do good Deeds and do not make partners with him, As he is our master he can do what he want with us, But he is merciful we must repent and subdue to him, There Is no GOD but GOD and Muhammad Peace be upon him is his messenger
wait its Jan 12 how is it April wierd pls awnser
ITS GOING DOWN FOR REAL
There were 666 comments.<br><br><br>I ruined it.
EARTHQUAKE...BIBLE MATEUS 24:1, NATION RETURN..TO GOD HOLY CREATOR...GLORY..JESUS IS COMING..GOD HOLY IS LIFE ETERNITY..AMEN..
What was the magnitude?
I&#39;ve ever felt an earthquake repeatedly, an amazing experience on my life..  this is nothing compared to tsunami earthquake (dec 26, 2004)
Looks like they were taught what to do during a earthquake.Good people in this country.
Good to see the cell phone networks weren&#39;t overloaded. More than a few people in the footage can be seen using phones. When we had a minor shake (compared to this) in Barbados on November 29, 2007, the cell phones didn&#39;t work. Hopefully, the networks have since been upgraded to allow more calls simultaneously. This region is actually overdue for a Magnitude 8 or greater quake.
help our country Nepal God please bless all the people in our country Nepal
all was peaceful and calm in Nepal until dun dun dun earthquake hits boom gone
If god(s) exists, it must have a great sense of irony. <br><br>&quot;Hey let&#39;s have an earthquake in one of the poorest and least developed countries on the planet and see how they handle it!!&quot;<br><br>Fuck you God(s).
I don&#39;t know why, but i love when people who don&#39;t know eachother work together to stay safe and well... alive.
O_O  was in 2 Minor ones myself in CNY:  Sylvan beach and oneida.   There is a Fault line that runs down from the adirondack Mtn. range  through Oneida lake down towards NYC (?)
Im glad they all knew to run outside in the middle of the street away from buildings that could fall on them
This reminds me of Godzilla
same thing experienced here in North India on 26-10-2015 just one hour back.....
Boy that&#39;s one ugly looking city

For my birthday I wanted £50 ($75.91) to give to a family in Nepal who needed it.
And that&#39;s why we are afraid of earthquake s
yes its pretty bad but why are the people are running to the road ?? i dont understand
Donate money if you can. Raise awareness. But Nepal&#39;s money comes mostly from tourism. So please, if you were thinking of visiting, visit it.<br><br>Also, some people can&#39;t raise money. For some, praying is the best thing they can do. For theists, that is. Encouraging people to do more than pray is good, but saying it won&#39;t help is basically starting that age old debate of &quot;God doesn&#39;t exist&quot; which is NOT the conversation that needs to be had when thousands of people need immediate help.
Not to take away from the earthquake but did anyone else freak out watching those people drive in the beginning. I was pretty sure they were going to crash. I have no clue how they do that.
Despite 2 big earthquakes and less steel in building construction many buildings are still standing in Nepal which I saw on my recent visit to Nepal.I was very sad when I heard the news.I live in Australia.
ليش كذا كلهم وقفو مع بعض😐شكلي انا الوحيده هنا عربيه😭
No! Its too soon... japan just had theires(4 years but whatev) we dont need large ones..

shocking video fuck off
stabilize it
😆😅😅😅they stuppid😆😅😅😅
soon Jehovah will end all such earth quakes
I dont inderstand !!

I can&#39;t think of the terror these people had to go through. I live in a city, Istanbul, which is most probably gonna be struck by a powerful earthquake the country have ever experienced, and I was yet to realize what people went through until I watched a few videos of earthquake footage. I am scared out of my ass and can&#39;t even go out to see my loved ones. I am scared of losing them so much. I don&#39;t feel ready for the feeling of loss.
I hate earthquake 👹
BARBADD SAB BARBAD

For any country prone to earthquakes, who are thinking of making videos to show people what to do in case of an earthquake.... don&#39;t bother.  The people of Nepal showed how to do it.  As terrible as this event was, how amazingly brilliant did the people here show what to do during an earthquake.... and they did it immediately.  Pedestrians, people in buildings, people in cars/on bikes.  Perhaps other countries could pay to use this video as an example, and that money go towards helping the people of Nepal.
I really want  to tell that most of the people are linking the Nepal earthquake on sacrificing of animals in the terms of Religion. One thing Our religion dont teach us to kill or sacrifice Animals, or even I do that. This all are the superstitious beliefs that came from ancient times and lots of people are following this trend believing blindly.<br>I don&#39;t like Animals killing or scarifying while worshiping gods. And all Nepalease people don&#39;t follow those trend. There is no Question of blaming our Religion, just we blame the superstitious thought and its blind system.

People&#39;s lives are still being highly affected by the earthquake.  Please consider contributing to rebuilding efforts.  Even the smallest bit helps!  <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/nepalvillagerelief">http://www.gofundme.com/nepalvillagerelief</a>

i was in nepal at that time, but i was asleep and didnt notice the quake
Looks like Gadhimai is not very happy.
It had a contrary effect on my mood when I knew about all the people who died from the nepal earthquake.
nice to see smart people.. they doesnt hesitate a single min what to do :)
Wut? I thought you shouldn&#39;t get outside of the building during a quake, but Dropping, Covering and Holding on is the best option..
Do not kill animals for sacrifice.<br>I have no sympathy for Nepal at all.<br>They are now punished for their animal brutality.
thanks for good scene
Pray for Nepal and other countries
<a href="http://gofundme.com/y9s9saq8">gofundme.com/y9s9saq8</a><br>Help those in need! Donate today!
i think that due to killing of lots of animals(karma festival) leads to natural disaster
Clearly tells me that American cities need earthquake drills
Just make microwave jet engine solar space planes in china and water bomb the moon and mars and everybody can live in space.
Meanwhile in one of those buildings<br><br>&quot;Shit, dropped my Nokia&quot;
this is so horrible
Amazing how they all stuck together through something as terrible as this but why do they all run to the middle of the road ????
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=40">0:40</a> In the middle of the screen.. &quot;It&#39;s me, it&#39;s me, I farted.. sorry&quot;
that&#39;s bad that, I hope that Nepal survives this ;(
Lol you donated $300? So that means about $30, if that even, made it to Nepal. Donating doesn&#39;t help the govt&#39;s take it. Get a little smarter
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=178">2:58</a> you can see the cracks in the pavement on the bottom-left side of the screen start to rip apart! o.0

     If you don&#39;t believe in fate or destiny then ask the driver of the white car at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=118">1:58</a> what he thinks. Someone made what i consider one of the best comments ever about people as in strangers clutching each other during the earthquake. It speaks volumes of what life should be like! <br>    I am usually the guy ripping up dumbass comments or replies. Like a few of them below but for this it&#39;s almost degrading to those who suffered, died or survived to even finish reading or do as I always did in here.<br>     I&#39;ve had the honor of spending time with them on 2 failed attempts to summit Everest. The quality of those people is impossible to desribe and not sound cheesy. I remained in contact with a few Sherpas and their families and have tried to help where I could. The five Sherpas I know are all dead. The approximate 30-40 family members is now down to 9 who survived.<br>     Ive never been involved or knew anybody  that was lost in a tragic event on this scale. What do you say or do to honor them? For me to truly honor them is to become a better person and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve chosen to do.<br>     I can only guess what those that have suffered loss feel like when the tragedy is turned into a circus by conspiracy ass clowns. When this earthquake in Nepal is turned into the evil empires manipulation of mother nature as the cause. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll at least then have a better understanding for the term, &quot;going postal&quot;.<br>     We had better get over certain things and get on with it before that time comes and goes!
Ronald William Hevey discussed how WeChat Payment is supporting UNICEF HK’s recent relief work, “The devastating earthquake that struck Nepal resulted in severe casualties, massive destruction of buildings and infrastructure. Among the 2.8 million children affected by the earthquake, 1.7 million children are living in the worst-hit areas amid growing risks of disease outbreak. UNICEF HK immediately listed donation options on our WeChat Official Account aiding in the provision of water and medical supplies, to raise funds and meet the pressing needs of these children.”

Is that animals in the island in the middle of the road. See them running away from the concrete roof when it collapsed
Terrible really...i was at my home which is 700 KM far from Kathmandu that day and we all knew  it was devastating earthquake though no idea how big and where was the epicentre .Within minutes,we started to get the news as we predicated and it was really bad news.God Bless Nepal.
fuck.... watching this while living in California at the same time when an earthquake risk is very high right now is unnerving. D:
really sad this happened to nepal but u can prove that u can take care of eachother!!!!!!!!
You ended the video with a heart?
Strange things r happening to our earth 200 species die a day either that&#39;s a coincidence or something really bad is going to happen 
does anyone know if diliprai is alright? <br>diliprai used to send me many videos and info about the kirat people and culture of nepal. the only thing that pisses me off is that diliprai wants to ban indian culture and indian films in nepal. <br>he also want to divide india. he wants northeast of india to breakaway and merge with nepal. he used to come to indian video and leave bad nasty comment........but i haven&#39;t seen him for awhile now. <br>i am thinking if he is alright since earthquake hit nepal. do you know dilprai is alright?
the reason  behind this earthquake is because the nepalese people before  the earthquake they killed over 300,000  animals  ,   they killed all of those  innocent animals just to bring worshippers good luck for Nepal festival  !!   there is no Gods !!<br><br>it is  because  of this damn  ritual   the earthquake happened !!!!<br><br>why do they worship all  of those statues !!!   statues  that dont  even feel !! <br><br><br>Allaaah<br><br>there is only  Allaah !!       no damn statues   no gods    !!     there is only Allaah
It was in the UK as well<br><br>
impresionante
God bless the whole planet earthquakes can happen everywhere anytime :o
Those three strangers men hugging in the middle of the road broke my heart

Another uneducated motorists in nepal why do they keep on driving? even you set your clutch to the top gear you cannot resist the 7.2 earthquake. 
We been having small earthquakes here in Dallas. I get freaked out when it happens I can&#39;t imagine if I were in that situation.
Not being disrespectful and i wasnt there but the christchurch New Zealand earth quake was a lot worse just we had less deaths because our buildings are more safe 
I like the goof ball at the beginning that just throws his bike down and runs into the middle of the street. I mean really? You couldn&#39;t just ride it into the middle of the street. You really want a building to fall onto it?
Americans wouldn&#39;t even hold on to each other they&#39;d worried about themselves. Should take some notes it could be you.
see the road cracked in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=110">1:50</a>?
People sure know what to do in the event of an earthquake, thats some quick reacting. Donated towards aid in Nepal

Do not fear Death. Death is the destination where we all living creature goes , its no death ppl should fear, but u should fear about never beginning to life.

Very smart people to go to the middle of the street
All these comments about Jesus and praying. Fundraisers help guys. Praying sends a message to, well, nothing
Warning from God.
Wyh did anyone actually die in this earthquaqe? doesn&#39;t look too bad, I don&#39;t even see anything falling in the footage
Okay, Nepal. There was an earthquake in India as well. Maybe not that intense but still.
Why they pal up like that ?
I wonder what conversations were shared amongst strangers during the time of the earthquake...
2 hands at work do more than 1000 in prayer. If you want to help, help. Prayer isn&#39;t help, it&#39;s delusion and false hope.
me aburo no hablan nada  que haburido jajasjaaja
im from manaus brazil i prayer for nepal!!!!
God blessed nepal
See how all the people huddle together.
thats why i live in the midwest where we only have to deal with, tornados, floods, hail, extreme winds and people from iowa
BE AWARE NEPAL AND BE AWARE THE WHOLE WORLD. WHEN YEAR 21 COMES, THE FINAL DESTRUCTION OF HUMANITIES WILL COME TO AN END. TIME WILL START TO END. THERE WILL BE 1 LONG HOUR EARTHQUAKES WITH INTENSITY 12 TO INTENSITY 24 THAT WILL SHAKE THE WHOLE EARTH, THE SHAKE WILL RISE AND FALL, THE WAVES WILL ROAR OVER THE COASTAL LAND ALL OVER THE WORLD DESTROYING BILLIONS OF PEOPLE. FOLLOWED BY MEGACRAYO METEORS THAT WILL FALL DOWN INTO THE EARTH TO KILL THE REMAINING BILLIONS OF HUMANS. THESE WILL ALL HAPPEN ON YEAR 21, THE JUDGEMENT YEAR OF GOD. FOLLOWING TO THESE, THE EARTH WILL TURN TO DARKNESS FOR 3.5 YEARS.

1love to the people of Nepal
Look how small we are in comparement.
This is good lesson and punishment for them who are killing innocent animals you idiots. Mata never ask for bali , its bcoz u idiots want to eat. If you want to give bali then give your own or your families bali you stupids. If you never stop then mata ji will punish you more bcoz if you cant give life then you got no right to take life you aas holes
so lucky car<br>in second video
Scary!!
Its sad to see that they dont know where to run to. no place is safe
The day Nepal stood still.  :(
Write on Yahoo: GO COMELY<br>TRY this Trick :D
Omg and another one struck you guys again another earthquake. My prayers are with you😢
Allah ho Akbar
God bless people in nepal, it is time to ask the Lord Jesus Christ for guidence for mercy and grace it is time to turn to God the father before it is too late get a bible those that don&#39;t know who Jesus Christ is, he died for your sins and he is waiting for you to come to him and ask him for forgiveness of sins and truly repent. Jesus is the way the true and the life.<br>God bless.
i was really afraid that day (worst day of my life):(
Look at the man on the left side, he is a brave one :)
i am glad that they know what to do when an earthquake strike.. i pray for nepal
Namche Bazar had one this morning.
They deserve it! They slaughter thousands of innocent beautiful animals within 2 days for their ignorant religion. What goes around comes around!
Straight line of people on the street O_O
Nepal the bad times r yet to come.... remember the gadhimai festival... u have to suffer more... mother nature is just doing justice
I also thought it was beautiful seeing all the people holding &amp; comforting each other during those scary scary moments...says a lot about them.
Everyone bravely held on to each other for support, and where did the cop go?? I guess he high-tailed it out of there, LOL..
OH my god this is so sad , my tears just wont stop ... I would give all my money to those people.. ;x// i hope this never happens to you again.. gosh to noone ever..
This is not Speiburg, this is real. I&#39;ve got a bad feeling that this is all leading up to something really bad. Are there any volcanoes blowing right now, I wonder?
Wtf... that white car that just about mowed people over! Smh
shame the country did not sink into magma
God bless everyone in Nepal! If i had Money i would donate every cent :(
Look at the street crack in the second video!
Look at them run from the power of God. Such primitive stone worshiping beings.

Plz help Nepal  don&#39;t angary do tend
Thats god work...no buffalo work ...will u still offering buffalo.....hmmm..maybe need 100000000....more buffalo.....please...god hungry...
Amazing seeing their organization to something like a natural disaster. A true demonstration of culture itself. If that happened here in Brazil, people would run desperate not knowing what to do. I would have been running like crazy!!! haha
who told u guyz to cut 5000 bulls.this is wat u get frm GOD
Kind of looked like a parade, and one guy shouldn&#39;t get out of his car..<br>I am not saying that is fun or great, It was just sort of intriguing what happens when panic happens
why can&#39;t people be like that in a daily basis? why must we face a fatal scene where anything could happen to embrace the idea that we could/should/must love and protect everyone as precious... every life is worth more than anything, don&#39;t wait for a time like this to be kind to one another...
At this moment of suffering and need ,  Indians sent us date expired foods and old clothes . The Indian media made some unnecessary and fake news ... INDIANS ......GO FUCK YOURSELF ... BITCHES
looks like theres no damage
praying won&#39;t help......if u r praying to god,u better know it is god who did that.....wanna help,donate some cash,they gonna need it.....god only help rich ppl.....i have donated some,,,,now it&#39;s ur turn....have a nice day:)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=294">4:54</a> a heart edit transition
They do not want cut it down tree, destroy forests and make big big bulding.look at other develop contry they have prettiest bulding no walk without car and other wheel stuff.but this country seem no good system there but have good majority, own feelingness.they are smarter then developed country compare how they live.they shows us we are human being and people should have human nature activities around the world.god give them helping hand.from USA Minnesota
Once again, this demonstrates what I have always thought and said, &quot;We are all human beings&quot;. I could not detect anyone there from another planet. They all grouped together and sought comfort by holding hands...
Didn&#39;t see anything ...
God sends warning to astray people . SF is next look at all the gay congregation there !
the earthquake was caused by India. india is to blame.
i was in delhi
Se nota que no es un pais sismico por que lo primero que hacen es entrar en panico y correr sin fijarse lamentablemente estan pasando por esta situacion los mexicanos ya lo vivimos y tenemos esa educacion sismica lo que podemos hacer de verdad es enseñarles esa evacuacion a los paises no sismicos ya que no hay garantia de nadaes una pena lo que les paso pero ya dejen de lucrar con sufrimiento ajeno
Excelente reacción ,salir al centro de la calle y calmarse lo mas posible para protegerse  ellos tuvieron mucha suerte.
Notice the cracks getting larger on the ground at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=180">3:00</a>
its only like 5seconds
This is what happens when they don&#39;t believe in God because they have so many idol&#39;s and they do bad, <br>Micah 1:3 Look, the LORD is leaving His place and coming down to trample the heights of the earth.<br>4 The mountains will melt beneath Him, and the valleys will split apart, like wax near a fire, like water cascading down a mountainside.<br>¿¿¿¿ WHERE ARE ALL THE gods THAT THEY HAVE , THE IDOL&#39;S THAT THEY HAVE THEY DIDN&#39;T DO ANYTHING FOR THOSE PEOPLE, !!!!WAKEUP NEPAL THE REAL GOD IS CALLING YOU JESUS IS THE ONLY GOD.!!!!<br><br>
Doesn&#39;t look that bad....the thing don&#39;t even move a lightpost.....and it didn&#39;t went for too long ....
OMG!
It&#39;s incredible to see strangers holding each other for safety and support.   I really hope that people in other places in the world would do the same thing in similar circumstances.  People are good by nature.
tho den.???????
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=180">3:00</a> watch the sidewalk in the lower left and keep watching...
its incredible how many people lost their lives in this earthquake when they all seem to be doing the same thing, running away from all buildings and into the road where there are clear openings, and holding onto the nearest rails in sight.<br><br>i take it that the people that died were mostly inside apartment complexes and couldnt get out of the buildings in time.<br><br>Napal, you guys sure know how to do a proper earthquake drill! good on you.
OMG! This video had me sobbing my ****ing eyes out!!!! I feel for the people of Nepal.
Holy shit, these people were losing their balance. That was quite the quake.
Bless the dead and injured. Bless those that suffered loss of family members. Bless those that have no home to go to. Bless the people of the World for helping hands. May the God of the Earth bring mercy for the people of Nepal. <br>
هذا جزاء كل من يدعوا مع الله اله اخر، اللهم اغفر لنا وتب علينا وارحمنا، اللهم احفظ بلاد المسلمين وتب على الغافلين ودمر أعداء الدين يا حي يا قيوم 
shoking video..<br>very sad
They might not have the prettiest looking buildings,but they sure some damn good cctv cams.
Where they bundled up in the street to avoid the collapse of the building and to not fall???? 
This is sad my birthday was 4 days before
No reflections on the white building glasses at all. Blurs around &quot;digital&quot; people and vehicles. Lack of physics. Lack of proper shadowing objects. Im not swallowing this. Are you kidding me? I lost faith in India people. I thought India has best IT specialists,graphicians and programmers. But this is really CHEAP CRAP.
these are warnings from Allah the omnipotent king
This earthquake happened on my Grandmother&#39;s birthday, she died on her birthday back in 2003. Wow.

Gadhimai festival is a sacrificial ritual that is held every 5 years at the Gadhimai Temple of Bariyarpur, in Bara District, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the capital Kathmandu in the southern Nepal, near the Indo-Nepal open border, adjacent to Bihar. It is primarily celebrated by Madheshi tribal people and Bihari people. The event involves the large scale sacrificial slaughter of animalsincluding water buffaloes, pigs, goats, chicken, rats, and pigeons – with the goal of pleasing Gadhimai, thegoddess of power.<br><i>_____________________________</i><br>Exodus 20:3-5 (KJV)<br><br>3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<br><br>4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.<br><br>5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I theLord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;<br><br>THE NEPAL EARTHQUAKE WAS A CLEAR PUNISHMENT<br>FROM GOD!

Did anyone notice that the road in Durbarmarg cracked open because of the tremor?
Today, a 4.2 earthquake hit near my house. It&#39;s the first earthquake I&#39;ve ever experienced and the second largest Michigan has ever had. So for the people in Nepal to have a much larger one, it really makes me realize how terrifying an earthquake could be
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=109">1:49</a> that white car at the right tho... Few meters back that thing could have crushed that car. Wew!

Watching the cracks develop in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=162">2:42</a>
We all people pray for Nepal now
لا إله إلا الله
why did they abandoned the bikes instead on putting them in the middle? or why the guys in the middle didn&#39;t just put the bikes on stand position O.o
them getting into the middle of the street is the BEST thing they could have done in a city like this! probably saved lots of lives!
I agree with john below me
This is amazing. In a time of great crisis, the Nepalese shows us strong solidarity by holding onto each other, stranger or not, they will not think twice about who they are holding hands with in a disaster.
Shame so sad some people lost there parents and so did a 4year old boy he was looking after his 2year old sister
That is scary
Did God just kill 6000+ people and injured 14000+ ??
May god be with nepal
Praying isn&#39;t going to help. If you really wanna help than donate some money or start a fund riser. People pray all the time and what has it gotten us NOTHING!! So get off your ass or shut the fuck up. I already donated 300 dollars in aid what have you done.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=108">1:48</a>
prayers and support to all those affected. Look at the bottom right corner of the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heSOBf-sOm8&amp;t=110">1:50</a> you can see the road crack from the force of the quake.
Thank God! He is everything! 
I believe in my heart, God is telling all of us; if we don&#39;t be as 1 then we have no....
