I&#39;ve seen it with Phil Collins playing in the background. <br>Drum solo starts, as she trips. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
And she was so careful to gently place the glasses on the tray.
Yeah, no: it&#39;s fake. Real glass doesn&#39;t break like that. If it did, it would useless, as it would get broken by drunk patrons, passersby leaning on it, and vandals ALL THE TIME.<br><br>That&#39;s candy glass, or whatever it&#39;s called, that they use in movies to have glass break without people getting hurt. Actual windows of that size are made of flexible plexiglass, nowadays.

REAL NOT FAKE
how dumb is she to look behind  her before  she  walks  back
But she was just doing he job and tripedðŸ˜¥
she has ghosts
Next time she&#39;ll know better: line up the chairs first, then do the tables
I just love all the stupid idiots on here that are screaming up and down how it&#39;s not fake, when two seconds of Google search would have revealed that this video is a fucking advertisement for DulcoEase, a stool softener. Really, the comments section of YouTube is proof positive evidence that the human species is fucking doomed.
I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s fake and I don&#39;t think anyone would fall through a window like that on purpose she&#39;s not getting paid and she&#39;s at work, so I don&#39;t see how people can say this is fake.
is she dead
Yeah this is fake, no bar that has CCTV also has sound. Not even most high end places have sound on CCTV it would pick up way to much noise and would add to bloated file sizes.
I saw this on Shaun Micallef&#39;s Mad as Hell, a video called Walk and Talk or something.
Lmao.. Somebody going to be short on the paycheck ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
poveracciaÂ  speriamoÂ  cheÂ  nonÂ  siÂ  siaÂ  fattaÂ  male
FALSO come Giuda!
Porco il cazzo! E questo dovrebbe essere divertente?
I hope that&#39;s she&#39;s alright and not get cut with all of that broken glass wow
Needs to be turned into a RKO out of nowhere video

This is fake. Notice how she strafes into the second stool.
The funniest part is that 3 seconds earlier, she had no idea she was going through that window.Â 
This IS NOT FAKE! She forgot that stool was there and the rest went all bad. I hope she was ok
im dying from laugher haha. but hope she is alright. pretty girl
No it&#39;s fake
Let&#39;s all assume it&#39;s not fake. That poor girl. I bet she&#39;s still pulling glass shards out of her head right about now
This is so not fake. The way she tripped is just too real.
of course its fake. brittle windows like that, would need to be replaced basically every single night, do tue all the idiots knocking on it, while walking by. but head first through that &quot;glas&quot;, still looks good.
Wow!!

Ive heard of people trying to leave work early but this takes the biscuit!!!

She should NEVER be allowed near any kind of glass again!!!!
Hope she was ok
