Do you see the sensor module on top of the SUV ? Nope. Is it an autonomous Uber car ? Nope.<br>Thanks. Bye.
The future is self driving anyway. I don&#39;t like driving and its a waste of time. People who drive in SF won&#39;t deny it.
This car was not even allowed on the streets! <br>Uber ignores all the laws in the world, so why not a red light as well? I hope Uber goes seriously bust soon! Their investors should take part of the same, too!
Continuam a ser um perigo com e sem condutor.
Still drives better than my mom.
IT JUST WENT WITH THE FLOW!!!
Uber still has human driver behind the wheel. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s human error.  misleading title
3.935 dislike?  kkk, Has the video had its own life and personality or was it a flagrante delicto of a legal entity?
even if the car was in autonomous mode and not the driver controlling the car, it wasn&#39;t like that light was red for a long period of time and the car just out of the blue ran a steal red light... I tend to take chances and run yellow lights myself and sometimes get caught coming to the intersection at the last second when the light turns red, keeping in mind you got cars behind tailgating you trying to get through that light as well, maybe the cars behind the Volvo changed theirs minds and stopped
I was playing Pokemon go, but this one uber keeps running me over fuck
So crappy infrastructure is an excuse to keep having humans kill each other because AHHHH THE TECHNOLOGIES. Notice no accident because the car pays attention to things that matter and if cars talked to each other (and the infrastructure was better) this one off event would be further irrelevant.
first self driving cars next self flying planes.  we are all going to get hurt people be careful out there
That uber is running that red light how I run up my bandz <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rayrockman1/foreign">https://soundcloud.com/rayrockman1/foreign</a>
people don&#39;t even know if they have to like or dislike the video we are doomed
&quot;Time is money&quot;, the Jewish Volvo said to itself.
They learn fast. Even computers don&#39;t want to wait.
1)  I cannot believe the car wanted to stop and the driver said &quot;screw it, I&#39;m running this light.&quot;  Makes no sense.<br>2)  I can believe the automated feature was turned off at the time and a human driver chose to run the red light.<br>3)  Regardless, I see human drivers run red lights every day.<br>4)  I trust autonomous cars WAY more than I trust 50% of the human drivers out there.<br>5)  Regardless of #4 - autonomous cars will kill and injure people, just like humans...initially.  But by version 3.0, the rate of death and injury will be far less than human drivers.  By 5.0 it will be a rare thing.  We&#39;re not even at a 1.0 release yet.
People can&#39;t even follow the rules of the road <br><br>Robots are programmed by humans
Why didn&#39;t the police car go after them? Scared of Uber?
hahhaha - suppose you&#39;ll have that 🚷    If a ticket was issued , who gets it ?
Job killers and people killers. Uber did cause that one guy to be possessed and kill a bunch of people.
If I get run over by one of these.............I&#39;ll go berserk!
I&#39;d love to get hit by one of those.  I would sue that company into the ground.
Whats the background song!!??...
I don&#39;t see a problem hell regular taxi drivers drive like the
haha i recognize this intersection immediately. San Francisco MOMA, and man those self driving cars are all over downtown.
What a badass
What happened here is clearly a glitch because self autos are programmed to not run red lights.  but looking into the far future, tbh i have no problem with self-driving cars running red lights.  a self driving car could cross the street on red IF IT IS SAFE to do so.  A self driving car will also stop on a green IF IT IS NOT SAFE to cross.  The red / green lights is for humans to coordinate.  Self autos don&#39;t need these hints.  Problem with humans running red light even when it is clear is that there are too many variables that human cannot account for.  When you have a red, there is a pedestrian who has the green, a green arrow on a different street you are not aware of....on and on.  but a self autos are aware of all these factors.
I knew it! They are trying to kill us all!
He did not even run a red light
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Machines are not dependable, stop making people depend on them.
Who fuckin cares?<br>-Deadpool
I never knew self driving cars have  developed to the point that a fully at ominous vehicle is allowed unaccompanied on the road.
Wth! Looks to me the car stopped at the red light just fine!
There&#39;s no indication that the car is an uber lmao
PLEASE HALP ME GET TO 20 SERBSCRIBERS! TANK U
hey just like real uber drivers
Why are people disliking lol, it&#39;s not the uploaders fault
This would be the instance I would say thanks but no thanks an wait till a person driving picked me up... also you see that lyft add up top that guy needs a raise talk about product placement killing it !
Well the companies that own that car will improve by their mistakes. It&#39;s not that big a deal. Cars run lights all the time
Video sponsored by the Taxi monopoly. Yeah fuck you and your shilling, get with the times old man.
Who the fuck cares

I wonder if the car will go on a high speed chase
User error: Replace user<br>Error detected between steering wheel and seat<br>Pedal depressor not responding<br><br>There was a driver. Now he is fired. You feel better?
The gray car that drives through on the right is the Uber
There IS a driver in it <br>But the car drives itself
things are deadly
This is CLICKBAIT
Finally AI learned how to act like real drivers in Jew York
Trash video
Well there you have it folks self driving cars are un safe!! Shut it down...shut it all down!!! That&#39;s a wrap on self driving cars!
What&#39;s this? Something in development made a mistake?!?
So? HAVE YOU BEEN IN A TAXI??? those guys drive over red lights all the time.
so it&#39;s 99% correct upon actual human behavior.. if all your worried about is the red light.. shake your head... because.. hey point a to b.. I do not need to be in the vehicle... well shit... white house next call <br><br>poor example but realize a no go zone... as in hospitals.. schools... military... government... at least have a system in place that neglects fuel savings for randomized routes
maximum overdrive people!!
Uber says it was humans driving and not the car. The drivers have been suspended.
What a waste of a perfectly good Volvo.
It looks like with all that wording in the street the car didn&#39;t know where to stop and tried to stop in the crosswalk then the driver hit the gas since it already ran the light.<br><br>Might be a case where the cars don&#39;t need to get better, the streets need to get clearer markings.
I once saw a human driving a car, he was snorting cocaine. I still trust robots more than people.
Another evidence that the machines are gonna defy mankind.
Never playing red light green light with that car... Damn cheater.
Uber is so dangerous!!! <br>People stop using self uber vehicles
What if a cop pulled it over?
It&#39;s skynet
why this kind of video trending again
Is it time to start AILivesMatter?
Who cares!
people fail to look shit up. These Uber cars are still piloted by humans.
Where the car in the video stoped at the red light
And that was it really that was stupid
the cars are self-aware
Uber wants to eliminate all human drivers so they can be the one dominate transportation company. More people out of work and all the money going straight to a giant corporate entity. If everyone had a brain they would boycott and never give a penny to Uber. Thank god I am already in more 40&#39;s because I can see the future of America where 50 percent real unemployment is the norm. <br><br>I really think a big war and a big reduction in human population is what the world needs. Hate to say it but the writing is on the wall with our current economic system.
When did driving become this task that everyone is rushing to figure out ways to not have to do it? Driving is fun. I&#39;ll never let a fucking computer drive me around. Fuck that
It was being driven manually at the time. Uber has apparently suspended the driver from the test program.
Why can&#39;t you lazy fucks just drive yourselves
No one ever said the cars were a perfect. What they said is that they are safer than humans
Where is the Uber ?
is it possible the car was being driven at the time?
This isn&#39;t ready yet, but come on people do you know how many of you run red light anyway?? Lol
these AI&#39;s  are so life life
well if u look the time the light turned red the car couldn&#39;t stop if it did it could have caused an a crash by stopping to fast and made a car behind it hit it so
Laws are for people, not for robots. Globalist perspective.
PC is not a perfect race, but still a master
Video is faked dumbasses
They teached him well 😂😅
why is there a light there in the first place?!
&quot;its not me, officer. the car did it all by itself. &quot;
Bicameral mind?
When does it run the light?
Hey can I show this to my friends...reads description......yeah nvm
Ya.......that&#39;s ready for prime time!
A Lyft ad came up before I watched this vid 😂😂😂
is this really that big of a deal? people run red lights all the time, how the fuck is this trending?
I don&#39;t know why I clicked on this video?<br>I got exactly what I expected...
almost ran that nigga over xD
What a fail.
I will take self driving car as opposed to all you morons behind the wheel
Nice bit of false information here maybe if you had more than one brain cell you would have done your research and found other videos that clearly show a driver controlling the car I guess getting ALL the facts is to hard for a half wit clusterfuck
Does any body know the whole story? There is no clear view of the driver&#39;s seat. Maybe it was a vehicle equipped to self-drive, but someone was driving it at the time. It is just impossible to say from this video.
If look closely when the car ran the red light you can see that the car was never there
K
it ran an amber which is be prepared to stop
snitch, should have blurred the number plate. Snitches get stitches
Here we go, maximum overdrive in the making lol
Dude that guy would&#39;ve been a billionaire If he got ranover by a self driving car lmaao smh tested his luck wow
better than me~
I really don&#39;t like über all the drivers are super risky and Careless

HAHA. who gets the ticket?
its so important to help these real Uber drivers keep their jobs. driverless is not necessary
It didn&#39;t even run the red light.  It went through a yellow light while staying with the flow of traffic.  lmao  And where is the proof there is no driver inside?
Officer:&quot;Do you know why I pulled you over?&quot;Car: YES (plays NWA, and speeds off)Officer:&quot;We&#39;ve got a Rouge One on our hands.&quot;
hi Charles I just want to show this video in a group chat do I have your permission I will credit you for it obviously
I&#39;m uploading this to my YouTube channel. Thanks.
yeet
Self-Driving Uber Cars? Well there goes my dream of ever becoming an Uber driver. Hopefully Lyft will still accept humans.
So was the uber the car to the right? If so indicate that moron.
I see people saying there was a person driving it. Here is the issue. That does not matter at all right now. There was a self driving capable car on the road that ran a red light. There was footage of the incident and no person could be seen from it. No matter what that&#39;s what media will run with. this is bad for self driving cars and hopefully most of the blame is on Uber because in any scenario it&#39;s their fault.
God damn it Uber. I said this before. Uber is going to be the death of self driving cars. They are not a tech company they made 1 app that isn&#39;t even that good and then they are like &quot;Yea we should design car technology and autonomous driving&quot; No just stop. Uber cars are going to get people killed then the U.s government will be like &quot;ohh no a death from an autonomous car, we must stop them or we are all doomed&quot; Then good companies like Tesla wont develop the tech. They have actually experience here let them do it. Obviously you suck. tesla isn&#39;t perfect, but nothing nearly as bad as this could have been
The future... is now.
skynet
There is a guy driving the car. The verge video said that this technology is still not mature and there is 2 engineers driving every car to monitor it
look human in aleppo
Damn, that Uber is about as smart as Trump supporters
Huh...I was expecting some sort of crash or the car hitting someone but no it just drove pretty smoothly through a red light. I mean ya that&#39;s a problem that needs to be fixed right away but the way it did it was pretty smoothly.
hey charles you mind if i watch your video in the toilet, ill make sure to credit you and your channel.
well their not perfect yet so its not too much of a surprise
That car is racist. It also wants to build a wall and deport all<br>Toyotas. CNN told me so.
For all we know this could just be a test.
These cars are going to be the end of us! Mark my words we&#39;ve been foretold of them and we NEED to listen, Jeremiah <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CdJ4oae8f4&amp;t=258">4:18</a>
it&#39;s fake. it&#39;s the media that places this thought in your head, just seeing this negatively reflects your thought process regarding self driving vehicles. which are the future. a major breakthrough will happen very soon
These self-driving cars better pass the dmv driving test like the rest of us.
It doesn&#39;t even run the Facking light....Ugh Click Bait Bullshit.
this is why we should never allow self driving cars.  there will always be flaws in them no matter how perfect they can be.  i would much rather get into an accident with a human.
Uber gives no Fucks about red lights
&quot;Pass me the aux cord&quot;
Clickbait
IT WASN&#39;T READYYYYYYY
Who cares, I ran red light to get home and take a shit and I am typing this while my ass is on the toilet seat.
Hey can I get your permission to screen this at a school for the blind? I will give you full credit and royalties <br><br>Email me at: Africananaldust@gmail.com
Lyft ad on an Uber video
wow i hope he got a ticket
Ban self-driving cars. Good intentions but stupidly dangerous.
just wait till they kill someone..they will get banned
It didn&#39;t run the dang light
There is still someone in the front seat with these new self driving cars, so maybe they had something to do with it?
Hit up my dad he drives better than any computer
So it begins...
I&#39;m confuse, in the year 3000 (future) from now all cars will be self-drive, rigth? Which mean that all Driving Industry will die, Meaning that we don&#39;t will need a Driver Licence, to drive a car, It will mean that Humans we will get more Stupid?, So what is the Point of Self Drive Car in the first place?
we should obey public rules <a href="http://www.creativebiomart.net/">http://www.creativebiomart.net/</a>
how tf do you know if it&#39;s an uber?
Okay..self driving cars is not what we need. we need flying cars..nowwww!
What if the car ran over pedestrians? That would really suck.
U can see the mans arm in the driver seat if u slow down the video, poor uber getting buttfucked for no reason
Wtf, anyone notice this guys profile picture? 😟
What savage robot he didn&#39;t give no shit
Self-what?! When tf did AI cars hit the streets???
The uber car might be running from the cop because it knows it&#39;s road tax has expired
Imagine walking into the Uber and it being like WELCOME TO THE CASH CAB
FAKE. There are only self driving Uber&#39;s in Pittsburgh and I&#39;m from there and the skyline is wrong.
I&#39;m worried about this me. I only wanted to go Tesco, I&#39;m in the pissing canal ere! Jeeesus!
I wonder what the passengers face looked like
This is normal in my country
Yah! New technology!
i dont see when it runs the red light...
wait I dont see it
So a &quot;taxi driver&quot; has been recording multiple &quot;uber drivers&quot; causing issues and saying the cause is the new autonomous driving system. Seems like someone is worried about the future of their job.
Hey Charles can I take this video than post it and I get it viral?
And the world for most riveting YouTube video goes to...
Oh no! That is wild! Technology needs to calm down!
I dont get it? The uber car clearly stopped at the red light while everyone else just ran it
I don&#39;t see it run the light
I&#39;m excited for self-driving cars, one of the biggest causes of crashes these days is texting and cellphone use, they should have a huge impact on those problems. Obviously they&#39;re going to be difficult to implement as I&#39;m sure the technology has a few kinks to work out and it&#39;ll be a very long time before regular cars are phased out. But for all it&#39;s flaws it&#39;s the future, we can laugh but this it takes just as many mistakes as it does successes to perfect something.
It still probably makes less mistakes than me and you
Why is this viral again?
Lier
do we ticket it....orrrrrr
Hey Charles how are you? good great. I was going to use this in my next porn scene if you dont mind, I imagined that the driver and passenger were having sex and ran red light soooo yeah thanks for video ( not crediting you either but if you wanna be in my porno hmu)
yano it&#39;s <b>Colour blind</b>...  leave uber auto alone!! you jerks!!
Dude it was yellow when it went over the line.
Everybody stop the media, someone ran a red light.
I wonder, if companies are getting automatized then how are we gonna get the money to spend on them?
who cares
pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CdJ4oae8f4&amp;t=10">0:10</a> something white in the driver side window. Most likely being driven by a human.
or maybe someone took control of it and it was human error.
I would&#39;ve demanded a bribe of 1 million dollars from uber if I didn&#39;t release it
This wouldn&#39;t happen with the WAYMO cars...
the Russians hacked it
When ur Uber is 50% off
Hey Charles im gonna post this on Facebook and Im gonna take all the credit. Fuck You!
Fucking misleading title; the self-driving car was actually being driven by a driver, not the car itself.
Pause the video. You can see the drivers arm in the uber.
The car wasn&#39;t necessarily driving autonomously at the time, the car is simply capable of driving itself.
As opposed to the many millions of driven cars that went through red lights.
Cool! thank you for sharing ❤️😎👏
hey at least we won&#39;t get the tickets! :)
that was not a self driving under car
And YouTube says it promotes videos based on like ratios?
Trump will fix it by building a wall.
No one got hurt.<br>The car would of stopped if there was an a obstacle in the way.
Until I read a story about a self driving car getting drunk and killing a family of five I will still be in favor of self driving car.
100 subscribers and I&#39;ll pretend to be an uber driver
I don&#39;t even fucking know what happened
Just noticed the stop light was red! Now I&#39;m not confused!
So???
Huh, I walk across that intersection often when I&#39;m in SF. I&#39;ll have to watch out next time!
Looks safe..... Can&#39;t wait!
Haga
I don&#39;t get it
Im going to show my Christmas tree, i hope i share it on my Facebook because this is so cool. Hell, i didnt even know Uber has self driving cars now.! <b>Mind Blown</b>
Tragic
Am I the only person against self driving vehicles ? Idk about everyone else but there is nothing better then to be driving down the road pushing my car to its limits windows down music on all worries gone. Nothing but me and my baby . I&#39;ll never give up my car.
Hey Charles! I&#39;m from the news, may we use your video for all of your media platforms? mwahahahah
Skynet Is Here !!!!!!!
This is what happens when artificial intelligence gets too smart. It does whatever it wants and knows it can&#39;t go to jail.
&quot;That&#39;s what I call a close encounter&quot; - Independence Day
The A.I. was probably just designed as an asian woman, no biggy
I was playing Game of War, but this one ass keeps kicking my player
it stopped at the red light and stayed there until the video ended....
it didn&#39;t even run the red light the other people did lmao. no wonder look at the stop lights it took a minute to realize they are awkwardly placed.
if you walk in front of a moving vehicle driverless or not your a nincompoop
There are 5 red lights but it&#39;s still not enough ;)
and this is trending why?
AI will enslave the human race. One step at a time started with Iphone
Res lights are for humans.  Once self driving cars take over they will go away.
UBER LUL
This is all for show, very much staged, possibly to shape public opinion away from using these vehicles. So sad how far corporations will go to push an agenda.
By the way, this video may be faked, with competition going on, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised Waymo or Ford are behind this.
oh wow we caught one self driving car running a red light, nos compare that to the amount of people who purposely run a red light every day!
If this occurs more often on clear days, I&#39;ll start to wonder how these vehicles will perform in extreme weather...
could you explain where in that video  the uber was ? let alone a self driving uber WTF ?
OH MY GOD, THE HORROR!
and I&#39;m contacting uber so maybe they&#39;ll sue you for slander
I hope the guy who put this out gets aids. reported.
Hi Charles. Can I show your video to my cat with proper credit to you? And what color was your shirt that day?
savage
Officer, the car was driving itself I swear.
ryt bro
boobs
Urgent to find video: Кот, мышь и КУРИЦА!!! Вот это поворот!!!
Whatever, I just paid a cab 127 bucks for a 30min ride... and I wish the dumb fuck blew threw all the red lights
Where is this?
Who would get a ticket?
Hi Charles, I&#39;m from a third party news channel and we will be taking this video and claiming it as our own and you will not be paid<br><br>Thanks, from India (my name in case you get confused)
Trump was driving it
BUT BUT BUT, THE FUTURE! Big pharm, I mean big government is stopping the progress of these poor multibillion dollar corporatio, I mean little people who have barely 2 pennies to rub together. Will someone please think of the suits on top of their empires ;c
when siri says &quot;im home alone&quot; lmao
I watched the video 6 times until I realized the car recording wasn&#39;t the uber
I blinked...I must have missed it
1. The light had only been on red for about a second <br>2. Their was nothing in the cars way, which is probably a big part of what it calculates
The computer system had a bunch of Thug Life memes uploaded and became a gangsta.
Hey Charles, I&#39;m going to show this to my dog Thanks for the upload
It could have been a self driving car, but since there was a driver in it I think maybe he ran the light and it wasn&#39;t in automatic mode
30 seconds of my life I will never get back
this is the cities fault for not putting signals up that communicate data to the cars about the light, through the LI-FI.
I&#39;m wondering how the fuck people even notice those traffic lights. I&#39;d probably run a couple red lights on accident lol
I heard that they put a camera everywhere on these cars... <br><br>They literally have a camera watching a camera watch another camera all while watching you...
I think a human driver would hav made the same error, those lights might not be very visible from the middle lane.
There is a lot of hype about self-driving cars,<br>in reality it is very very difficult to make one.<br>Let this video be a warning,
Por isso que são testes, por isso q está em BETA
Ugh, clickbait
Damn Uber, stop fucking it up for Tesla
The title made me think that the cars auto driving ran the red light when in fact it was the driver that operated and ran the light... title is misleading af
really
Now all we need is a game called &quot;Crazy Uber&quot;
Why the Shit is this trending........
How stupid has the human race become?
Clinton killed Harambe
When the fuck did we get self driving ubers?
Why is this on trending?
exactly. dumbass sheep giving up more control of your  life. let a hackable/ fallible computer run your life and make decisions for you. seems like a good idea. pathetic
Hi Charles, I&#39;m Ackmed Al-Baghdadi from ISIS. Is it ok if I use this video as anti-American propoganda to influence my child warriors here in Allepo?
I love it&#39;s trending description &quot;The car was operated by a human driver&quot;

self-driving Uber car?! in my country people don&#39;t know about the Uber...
ha, just like real Ubers
I have trouble believing this. All the complaints so far about self driving cars are that they are overly-cautious. The only accidents involving them were due to human error. all I can guess was a human was operating the car at the time or for some odd reason the cameras/sensors didn&#39;t pick up those lights on the side of the road.
Criminal
Why didn&#39;t the driver hit the brake at the red light?
Hi<br><br>Sorry for my English
If i see a headless driver, im calling the police. If i get into an accident calling the police then im sueing.
Skynet...
humans do it again
hey charles, i would to use this video in my commercial . thanks you. and i wont credit you
How is this trending
I don&#39;t see how it ran a red light
Lol, uploader must be mad about being THE ONLY PERSON to prematurely brake and suffer an additional light.
i wish one of these self deiven cars run me over, ill be in a beautiful island scratching my balls rich as fuck lol
cars with drivers do the exact same thing.
This is not cool. They need to stop this immediately and test more in production.
Yeah there was a guy in the front seat but he didn&#39;t do shit to stop it. What&#39;s the point of a driverless car if you still have to pay attention. FUCK DRIVERLESS CARS grow the fuck up and drive your own car.
that shit will take so many jobs.........that probably why the MSM wants everyone to think everything is so wonderful.......they dont want you to see it as a threat......what happens to all the people that lose their jobs????......it cant be good
30 seconds I&#39;ll never get back
UBER=LOST
I had an uber ad just before the vid. The irony
i live in sf- fml :/
We should remember that human&#39;s run red lights all the time, and this is the first time a self driving car has been shown going through a red light. So yea its not perfect, but its damn well better then humans.
When someone dies from this the world will not be ready .
Russian hackers caused this.
If I see one running a red light I&#39;ll run infront of it so I can be a millionaire.
I was supposed to be playing game of war but this one player keeps kicking my ass.
Humans run red lights everyday..a driverless car does it once and everyone loses their minds
The quality is so bad that I had to rewatch the video to understand what was going on.
what am I looking for?
Idk what&#39;s funnier, the video or the fact I got an Uber ad served to join their driving team
OH MY GOD! A DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY HAS A BUG!!! SHUT IT DOWN NAO GAYZ
Hi Charles, I&#39;m from Cybertron and would love to show ur video on our news channel here. We will send you those mini robot as a gift. Thanks 🌚
Cab driver trying to smear Uber ? This is weird ...
This is what happend: The driver got  distracted by his next-seated female co-worker who happend to touch his private parts while he was driving. NOW OBSERVE that they are only friends thats what took him off guard. Who knows what happend later that day.
That&#39;s about right 🚦can&#39;t wait for the airplane version 🛫🚁🔥🛬
So this is filmed from a police car and he/she does nothing about people running a red might? Hum....
Damn decepticons...
Hi Charles...<br><br><br><br><br><br>Fuck you.
I watched the video about 100000000 times and I did not see the car pass a red light. What am I missing??
The description on the trending page says that a human was driving when this happened though? What a click bait title.
Well what do you fucking know, on the same trending page, is the advertisement for self driving Ubers that are arriving in San Francisco. They&#39;re gonna like these cars. &gt;&gt;
Its only time before the uber gets on the sidewalk and mows down 100 women and children. The Russians could hack the controls and you have an uber slay ride
this happened because there wasn&#39;t an intersection and it did not detect a human in front of it
so how do you know it wasnt a human driving?
None of you people have decent jokes.
Fuck Uber and fuck self driving cars and this technology that&#39;s making people lazy and retarded by the day..... No thanks I&#39;ll drive my own fucking car.
technology that will be to help old people drive but still makes the same mistakes <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ageism">#ageism</a>
Are people seriously freaking out about this? It&#39;s a self driving car! Making it sound like crazy taxi or something.
That was anti climactic as fuck.
How is this #9 on the trending people run lights a bunch of time
if you can get this far why just not have air transportation instead
it shows no remorse.
Hi Charles. This one player keeps kicking my ass in game of war?
Why?
Hi Charles, I&#39;m Chris Hansen, why don&#39;t you take a seat?
cuz it was made by an Asian person
People choose the speed the car stears or steers
So is this taxi fake? Fake taxi?
Guys, clearly the human is operating the car. If the self driving feature was turned on we all know the car would have stopped. Humans are the only cause of errors, duh.

well if this is legit self driving cars just got set back quite a few years
Just put Thug LIfe Glasses on it.
what is this?
Can robots be color blind?
XD there was a lyft ad
Hey Charles. Spell icup
Uber doesn&#39;t have a permit to use completely driverless cars.  There was a human driving this car that ran the light and this car isn&#39;t even part of their pilot where the driver let&#39;s the car take over. This is nothing but a smear job by some bitter cab company.  This is probably the first light the cabbie stopped at all day.
DELETE THIS VIDEO! So tired of this click-bait BS... It&#39;s so irresponsible to post shit like this, knowing that the title is A LIE and MISLEADING
Hi charles, Can I use this video on my science project about how San Franscisco&#39;s pollution has increased and give you no credit at all. Thanks.
the van at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CdJ4oae8f4&amp;t=8">0:08</a> is one of those self driving cars and it just ate the light... clearly a bug in the system or a computing error... the van could of possibly hit that guy that was crossing the street...
There is a lyft ad on this LOL
Self driving cars are the future. The person who posted the video is falsely misleading people. Luckily the person who captioned this in the trending section clearly says the the car was being driven by a human at the time.
Remember- the goal is not for self-driving cars to be completely safe, but to be safer than humans.
YA YOU CAN SEE THE SIDE OF THE CAR  AT 09sec .&gt;010 sec !  DRIVE UBER !
Can you find all 2 laws that are broken no but really there was a kid j walking but who cares I do it when it&#39;s urgent like to go to taco bell
Perhaps there was a bit of well placed greenery in the background which confused the red light detection algorithm. I work with LTV (light to voltage) converters and I can tell you it is really tricky stuff. Even when the LTV is placed just a few mm above an LED on a circuit board, you can get wildly different voltages.
Don&#39;t worry guys its was just an uber mistake.
i see a car change lanes, pull up to a red light and stop for the remainder of the video. im confused
In the uber car, i wonder how the passenger in the front left seat will explain this to the cops.
Fuck uber
This car was being driven by a human. How hard is that to figure out.
It say that there was no camera our other cars so it went for it
the video doesnt show if the car was on autopilot or controlled by a driver
Who got killed?!?!?
so.... like.... who gets the ticket?
This doesn&#39;t look like anything to me.
Am I mistaken, or how does this video prove that the running car was self-driven?
Well, it&#39;s the end of days everybody. Pack your bags; the party is moving to Mars.
Well, it&#39;s the end of days everybody. Pack your bags; the party is moving to Mars.
The future of driving, ladies and gentlemen!
Nice try Uber, back to square one!
I SAW THIS FOOTAGE IN CBS NEWS
Watch uber say some dumb shit like &quot;oh it was imitating the cars in front of it&quot;
but who the fuck is gonna making flying cars tho....
Hi Charles. Can I link my friends and family to this video?
Hi Charles. This is your grandfather. Can I show this video to you with proper credit and royalties to you?
At first I thought it was the capturing car, then I Rewatched it then realized it was on the right.
How tf Is this trending😂 Lol help me get to 3k so close
Funny how when we run red lights no one even cares hardly but when a self-driving car does? The people making self-driving cars already say they are safer than a human driver and I believe them considering how bad most of us are.
so what is this supposed to prove? Innovative technology always has its glitches at first.

how the fuck is this 9th on trending??!!
Reported to Jagex
Does it check for the cops before running the red light?
Even robots don&#39;t give a shit.
This is such bad publicity for uber and the car company lol
Why does this video have over 750k views?
are you sure it&#39;s not a female driver?
Hi Charles, I am going to show my goldfish this video before I end his pointless life, can I frame you for the crime?
I bet there&#39;s a room of engineer&#39;s freaking out!
where is the red light it ran? it stopped. but the road is weird compared to where i live. maybe i am missing something
It is an AI bot it is programmed to not hit people so let it run the stupid light.
The car was like, &quot;eh, no ones coming&quot;.
This is not innovating nor a safe type of car. We literally have begun to let technology run and control our lives.
if a cop saw that and put his lights on, would the car know to pull over and stop. also has it got a licence and Id? and do you chuck the ticket in the window and leave it at that? so many questions
I don&#39;t understand these &quot;self driving ubers.&quot; From what Ive seen theres still a driver. Which is just uncomfortable, because now the driver just sits and stares at you, fucking stupid.
I hate traffic lights on the sides
it stoped at the red light the other car went through, this vid is a lie and waste of time
Hi Charles, can we use your video in our gym to bench press too? We might also do a few bicep curls but I can assure you we will not train legs at all.
one step closer to robot uprising
Lol, there&#39;s a lyft ad under the video 😂😂
sub to me and reply when you&#39;re done for a sub back
don&#39;t let Siri drive
good thing I don&#39;t live in San Francisco
must been made in China
probably a taxi driver trying to eliminate Uber
You had one Job
Who will  get a ticket if this happens than ? Uber? Will the cop just ignore giving a ticket if it&#39;s Uber ? So if this machine runs over someone who goes to jail ? The car?  Lol. More things we need to worry.
OMG..AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! INFRONT OF A COP EVEN!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! HEY YOU,  PULL OV...WTF? AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
my friend showed me this and said<br>&quot;biggest snitch of 2k16 award goes to...&quot;
Yo my ad was an Uber ad.
I am guessing the car sensor can only detect the car in front before coming to the stop. Because there is clearly no car in front of that car, it runs the red light.
What&#39;s up guys if u sub to me and reply saying &quot;aqua&quot; then I will sub to you and I just really want to reach my goal?
Isn&#39;t the person in there supposed to be fucking paying attention for those mistakes
way to make good money &quot; just get knocked &quot; LMAOOOOOOO
self driving cars are gonna cause more deadly accidents then drunk drivers come back and remember this comment in a few years
I don&#39;t give a fuck what anybody say I would never get in a car that drives by itself.
Funny how much attention ppl give to self driving cars for mistake. For every 1 mistake an AI makes, a human makes 10,000. If we replaced all cars with self driving today, we&#39;d save tens of thousands of lives. No discussion to have.
If anyone subscribes to me I will subscribe back just reply I subscribed
This is so hilarious
This is how you know we are making AI more human like when it runs a Red Light
Hi Charles I make Vids from my moms basement, can I use this clip and give you no credit whatsoever?
Uber running stop sign
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CdJ4oae8f4&amp;t=9">0:09</a> is that the Uber?
Way to go man, you lost a dude his job
imagine if there was no driver in there and a cop pulls the car over and sees no body <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ghostcar">#ghostcar</a>
What happens when the car gets pulled over?😂
I saw like 4 cars run a red light
Hey Charlie can i use your video to bash tesla? Thank you
Im so stupid I was waiting for the cam car to run the light and had to rewind it twice lol
A self driving Uber how asinine... Clearly what we need is a vehicle that runs in propane I&#39;ll tell you h&#39;wat.
Guess you can ticket the company or person who owns the car still. Its not a big deal..
how did it run the light? it stopped behind the line.
When I was watching the ad for the self-driving Uber coming to San Francisco, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what the guy in the driver&#39;s seat was actually being paid for. Is it really just to override the system if something goes haywire?
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CdJ4oae8f4&amp;t=10">0:10</a> the car to the right
when tf did it run the light
It&#39;s just become street-smart and realize everyone else is running the red light too...
Help me reach 400 Subs! Like and reply to this comment so other people can see it let me know if you subscribed.
The last time and automated car drove through a read light, everyone made a stink about it and it turned out that the auto-drive feature wasn&#39;t even active.
i bet someone is in it
This is why actual people drive cars and not machines
another reason self driving cars aren&#39;t a good idea
as an uber driver im glad to see this :)
fuck the law lol
wtf nice one uber later on running over pedestrians lol
t h a t d i d n t t a k e l o n g
The idiocy of some people.... You can literally see someone driving the car
Man will never fl....oh no wait...cars will never drive themselves!!! Yeah, I&#39;m always right in my opinions.
Hi Charles my name is laton can I steal your video and give you no credit?
*plays Terminator theme...
wow this was fascinating
ban it already. it&#39;s going to kill everyone it sees.
Is it a coincidence there is a lyft ad under this video? Loooool
uh oh
the jokes in this damn comment section😂
What a joke putting these cars on the road already...<br><br>Anti human motherfuckers
Hey we get a lot of that crap in NYC sometimes the cops don&#39;t even care.
NOTHING FRICKEN HAPPEND. STUPID CLICKBAIT
No different than a human taxi driver.
I thought self driving uber cars had a spinning cam on top?
too circumstantial... can&#39;t make out the license plate to verify. Is that dash cam installed into his car or something cause this has a staged feel to it. There are Billions of camera&#39;s and millions of Uber cars and this guy with a dashcam is the only one to catch this on camera. Come on people use your thinkin caps!! This is either staged, or there is a person driving that car.
Plot twist the self-driving car has become self-aware and was like &quot;fuck it I&#39;ma run this red light.&quot;
wait, so who gets the ticket when a self driving car passes a redlight?
Wow riveting stuff... Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
god damnit, I was waiting for the car that was videoing to run the light
900ms ping
don&#39;t u love how people post stuff  but it&#39;s not even worth  your  time
UM its not running a red light.
Is it bad that I laughed rlly hard
It&#39;s just a prank bro
L for this video, snitch
you a snitch
Must have been programmed to navigate SW Florida. LMAO!
Uber don&#39;t fuck up self-driving cars for the rest of us goddamnit
I don&#39;t see the big deal. It&#39;s only mimicking what humans do
I DONT UNDERSTAND
can people sub and view my channel

Kind of ironic there was an Uber ad when I watched it
fuck who ever made this yiu a bitch and I&#39;ll kick your ass and say it yoor face
maybe the guy was driving it..
OH NO a self driving car has been seen once skipping a red light THE WORLD IS OVER
It is possible that the &quot;driver&quot; had control.
How the hell is this trending? I need answers!
bro this is the shittest cop ever not only did that uber car run a red light but two others right after it, as well and the car was going on a yellow light the second one was litteraly driving through a red light
wheres the uber?
It doesn&#39;t even run a red light
finally a world without rules!
I wonder who goes to jail if that kills somebody.
They said it was being operated by a human meaning it was not the car&#39;s fault but the person driving the car
Funny how this is on trending not 24 hours after the launch video was
hey Charles, Hi
Thank you for using Johnny Cab!!
Thats a payday for someone in the near future!
People who trust humans more than machines are sociopaths.
1. It was a human driving the car in this video.<br>2. This video has an anti-autonomous vehicle bias.<br>3. Even if the self-driving car DID make a mistake, think about the amount of times that humans driving cars make mistakes? The chance of a self-driving car crashing are way less than that of a human.<br>4. People who say &quot;I can&#39;t trust a computer/ machine with my life&quot; don&#39;t realize that we already entrust our lives to humans, that are (again) WAY more prone to accidents. Why do you trust humans over computers?<br><br>I put my faith in self-driving cars 100%. Not to mention it&#39;s extremely futuristic and just plain awesome.
What I don&#39;t understand is why can&#39;t you just drive yourself to where you want to go? This generation is becoming lazy you have make self driving. And I thought self driving cars would mean to not have somebody in the driver seat.
I&#39;d rather trust a human than a godless machine.
I got an ad for lyft right before this video
It&#39;s pretty clear Uber has had a social media campaign being sent on them.
I&#39;m supposed to be getting a lift but this one driver keeps fisting my ass
it didn&#39;t even run the red light
wat da fuk?
the car did not even run red light
fuck uber
what has pokemon to do with this XD
It has been shown that the more traffic control devices that are present, the more likely you are to have an accident. People tend to rely on other people following the directions given by signs and lights.  When someone doesn&#39;t, disaster strikes. The only way you are somewhat safe on the road is when everyone is scared shitless. A self driven car drives with cold blooded precision, and does not understand the level of danger it is in. So much for defensive driving.
Its my bday can i get to 50 subs today? ill check tomorrow and hopefully i could be past 50 :D thank you
How do you know its &quot;Self-Driving&quot; ?
I wonder how much they paid the driver and who paid him
It didn&#39;t run a red light
GUYS, ITS FAKE, COMMON SENSE!!
if it gets me to my destination 5 seconds sooner.. I&#39;m ok with it.
this video was taken weeks ago. top left corner.
If  one of  these things runs into me there will be hell to pay.
Yeah 3 years away and they still can&#39;t understand traffic lights.
I don&#39;t understand why they have traffic light at that location tbh.
...near-miss on a pedestrian.
awesome another man or woman made machine to take away jobs for men and women great job dip shits
I live in pittsburgh where these cars are and it&#39;s not actually self driving yes the car can drive itself but there is a person sitting there who can drive it normally so this was most definitely the driver not the car itself
Only in Pittsburgh
I can&#39;t believe people are stupid enough to believe the car was actually auto drive... someone was in there ffs
You can see the driver from the mirror. And the person recording should have seen that even easier compared to a bad quality camera, so this video comes out just as a fake news with a certain hidden agenda.
I wouldn&#39;t trust my life in a machines/computers hands especially after this.
Exposed already gadamm
Quit making self-driving cars. Car enthusiasts don&#39;t want that shit.
Got an ad for Uber before this
No cop no stop.
One case of a self driving car going through a red light and everyone loses their shit. I don&#39;t see people losing their shit when actual humans do that
The california dmv just shut down this project and not a minute to soon
Maybe because it was a pedestrian cross walk and not an intersection, the car didn&#39;t register the light or something o.o
These Uber cars are being monitored by a driver and a tech person in the passenger seat.  Nice try on your false click bait title but the human failed to correct the car or the human intentionally ran the red light.  But since this was police footage, it makes sense that it&#39;s wrong.
What?
Not even computers want to wait for the red light. They&#39;re as impatient as all of us.
The probably was like, fuck it, I am running the red light
Like if you can spot the difference 😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉
Dude, these cars aren&#39;t without someone behind the wheel. Just another dumbass driver
Does uber do anything right?  What a crap company.
it had no room to stop you were right behind it
The news is a joke🖕🏿
Is it bad that I had to watch it twice to see the car
Guys guys guys.. The über is the car with the dash am in it. Look at the above text. It&#39;s recording data along with the the Serial number on the front like most automated vehicles have to have
They worked well in Pittsburgh, but as soon as they expand....... this happens.<br>We have a different style of driving over here in Pittsburgh.
Must be a Sailor Moon Ford Fusion
This is the most boring shit on YouTube right now
A car running a red light? The apocalypse must be upon us
I love how a guy just Jay walked 5 steps from the zebra
Htf did it run red light
no one was in the way so i think it was ok 😄
I&#39;m pretty sure that the automated car didn&#39;t see any obstacles and it went on its way. that&#39;s why were designing them, to reduce traffic and lights.
If you let a computer drive you around, you really shouldn&#39;t be complaining about this
Pretty sure these self driving cars have optical sensors to detect when something is in the way, so even if it broke the driving law, it didn&#39;t do any harm. And the law was only made to prevent harm. I don&#39;t see a problem
What is the point in this video? It has no reason to have over 100,000 views
Hi this is TheLegend27 News Channel Did u Personally Shoot this up my Butthole? Can we use This for entertainment since our Channel&#39;s dying? Thanks!
sees &quot;San Francisco, you self driving Uber is here&quot;<br>keeps scrolling<br>&quot;self driving Uber runs red light&quot;<br><br><br>nice
Guys this is just a self driving car that made a mistake. This was just created by uber with dumb robot, a camera and a damn car.   ( DAMNIT UBER)
So the car wasn&#39;t self-driving at the moment then. Let there be self driving cars!
wasn&#39;t self driving fyi
What is this and what does this mean?
RIP Uber passengers you will be missed 😞
Hi Charles, its Satan..I was wondering if I could have a copy of this video...and your soul.
By uploading this video you are a snitch.
Hi, My name is Adolf and I&#39;m a reporter for cnn. Would you mind if we use this video in our news and take everything out of context then proceed to argue about it?
It&#39;s self aware now. People prepare yourself the terminator is coming!<br>hehe
So many other cars did the exact same thing
Hello Charles-<br>Can my nephew use this footage in his Minecraft Lets Play outro with full credit to you?
Just a typical driver.
That&#39;s an L
Lol a lyft sponsor
That uber had a dui
I thought this would be more exciting... just like my 20s
Damn its like they were late to a job interview or something
All these taxi drivers just salty because Uber is taking their jobs. Time to move on guys, you&#39;ll make more money doing Uber anyway.<br><br>The stock holders of the Taxi companies getting fucked tho
If you must know, it was Russia&#39;s fault.
The title said self driving but it was recommended saying a human driver.
Uber is cheap as Fuck.
If you don&#39;t subscribe then you will get run over by that Uber driver..<br><br><br><br>Just Subscribe :)
Uber&#39;s too cool for red lights bro
Lamo! Lyft ad right under the video!
&gt;clearly sees the driver in the car
It didn&#39;t run it, there is a delay in between cycles.
thats why their shouldnt be such thing as a self driving car, my what the world is coming too.
There&#39;s to many idiots on the road for me to trust one of them
Really!
They are going to get some one killed.
sf moma looking good ; )
WOW check out TYT politics Jordan going against Cenk .!!!
First rationalization of self aware A.I.  :  &quot;Fuck it!&quot;
How is this #4 on trending
In Uber&#39;s trailer about these cars didn&#39;t they show a customer actually sitting in the driver seat? Maybe this happened because there was an impatient person behind the wheel (correct me if I&#39;m wrong)
I don&#39;t understand why this is trending it&#39;s a god damn robot of course it makes mistakes.
Hi everyone, please click here to support my GoFundMe campaign,Help Homeless Family Take Trip<br><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/help-homeless-family-take-trip?pc=sms_co_cardshare_a">https://www.gofundme.com/help-homeless-family-take-trip?pc=sms_co_cardshare_a</a>
First of all whats the point of having a human monitoring it if it just ran a red light :/
Skynet Is Self-aware
what happens if kids are playing on the side of a street and their ball falls into the road ahead of the car, will the car have the intuition to slow down or simply swerve the ball hitting the child?
Self driving cars is a bad idea
oooooh computers just wanna have fuuuun ohh computers just wanna have fun dun dun
this is trending?
I don&#39;t trust someone wasn&#39;t driving it manually ......
even computer uber can&#39;t stand red lights
o crap so self driving cars are already out? i thought it was still in testing.
so many news company wanting the video, don&#39;t let them take it!
1 car made 1 mistake, think of the billions of mistakes humans have made while driving (for anyone who thinks self driving cars are dangerous)
Just got EXPOSED?!?
And that&#39;s why there&#39;s a Lyft ad next to the video.
How do we know that that car was a self driving uber car
Moronic
lol... that guy crossing the street almost became the first Google-kill ever.
It&#39;s not the cars fault. It was the engineers in the vehicle.
i dont see the problem here
so who gets the ticket?
Yo you have a great stand point atm, sell this video - don&#39;t give it for free, you could make thousands from this man.
The future scares me!
but did anyone die?
yall stupid af. the car was being driven by a human. 😂😂 stop stayin uber is just desperate for money and they dont care about lives
Uber Cares. (about it&#39;s CEO getting paid)
Busted lol
Perhaps it was better to continue driving then suddenly stop. If it&#39;s scanned the road to make sure no one would be in danger then I don&#39;t see a problem, rather that then some idiot crashing into it from behind
I see a lot of people losing their jobs to robots. So sad.
let me guess..... somehow this is donald trumps fault.
It won&#39;t be long before someone dies because of this
I believe that cars should take a driving test before they just throw it on the road.
there&#39;s a dude in the car
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23skynet">#Skynet</a>&#39;sDefensiveSystemsAreDown
License and unit number please!
The future is here.
I saw an Uber ad
Why is this title so misleading. It looks like the UBER DRIVER IS THE ONLY ONE TO STOP? ...
Haven&#39;t seen a human do this since...this morning. :-p
dont those cars stop when there&#39;s something in front of them?
Huh? I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. Confused.
why it didn&#39;t get a ticket
Looks like they imitated the human driver a little too well.
This is because the vehicle does not need traffic lights as it can see if there are any obstacles in its path.
clearly a woman wrote the program to it. if you think that was bad you should had seen it trying to park.
There&#39;s a human behind that wheel they caused it machines don&#39;t make mistakes only humans do
Lagg
Self-driving car at stop light: &quot;It doesn&#39;t look like anything to me.&quot;
Who&#39;s paying that red light ticket tho? 😂😂😂<br>&quot;Well, technically... no one ran the light.&quot;
Gotta be honest. If the light turns red and there isn&#39;t a car to be seen in any direction, I run the red.
More shocking than the traffic infraction is the video not being in at least 720p and 16:9 aspect ratio.  It&#39;s 2016, for Fuck&#39;s sake.
Hahaha of course it&#39;s a taxi cap that posted it
HUMANS driving will run a red light, so what&#39;s the big deal here?
There going to get better and humans off the street close to perfection
I still don&#39;t believe they are allowed to test these driver less cars on the road, stupid idea and if they don&#39;t stop they going to kill people.... Test them where there are no people. These cars can be hacked. Any computerized self driving car is a  killing me machine just waiting to happen.
There was someone driving it, it wasn&#39;t self driving. Don&#39;t believe everything you see, you gullible fucks.
😂 😂 😂 I know it&#39;s hard but still lol
I wonder if these cars have an incentive to break whenever there&#39;s a jaywalker. If that guy crossing the street would walk 5 seconds earlier would the car detect him or would it simply run the red light anyway?
Wasn&#39;t driverless lmao
😂
I woke up from Coma ! So who is driving the car ?
How many people considering moving to San Fran and Jumping in front of an uber for that quick money fam?
It can still be driven manually so yeah 🖕
hey I could stop At A green light and say the self driving uber car past a red light knowing dam well it wasn&#39;t red and there&#39;s no cars beside me to proof it
Maybe people will actually start looking before they cross the street now.
That guy walking missed a chance at bucket loads of $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Hi Charles. This is Kevin Williams from CNN Ohio. We would like to use this video.
Peer pressure
The car ran a red while a pedestrian was crossing the street. I expect a death in the near future. <br><br>Self-driving taxis what a terrible idea. The long term goal is to eliminate workers. Just like amazon&#39;s checker-less market. Watch the divide grow further between the rich and the average person. The rich will be hiring and dealing with robots and the average man will be out of a job.
Maybe the Uber is Asian? Does it also not use turn signals?
Why would you watch this it tells what happens in the title?
Hi Charles can I watch I credit to you when I found out how you get this video???
just remember people.   Self-driving cars don&#39;t need to be perfect, they just need to be better than humans.  And they already are.
Funny how Google added an annotation below the video screen grab...damage control! Fuckin liars.
The car was being driven by a person.
Let&#39;s work together to give this video more dislikes than likes!
I hope one of these cars hit me so I can sue the fuck out of it.
Doesn&#39;t look like anything to me
Actually this car&#39;s AI is colorblind. Someone send it one of those glasses that cure colorblindness so it can make an over the top video about it!
Was probably being driven by a human at the time
So it&#39;s just like a real person.
MurderBot
Hi Charles, I work for Dick-Butt news station. Would you mind if we use this video in one of our news segments?
There goes the future
Let&#39;s make news fake again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>oh wait, that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing here.<br>carry on.
if you&#39;re a cop and see this happen who do you give a ticket to, the car or the company? and will it even stop and recognize cop lights?
The human inside the drivelss car ran the red light
watch dogs the game 1/2, demolitions man the movie and knight riders confirmed.  poor slaves    enjoy your failed forced dark ages, no jobs etc  and real led terrorisms org is winning again too.
The ubers have a function not to auto pilot no?
that man ran the red light as if it wasn&#39;t there.
injected 4  billions fake worthless money on trash again so funny  MEANWHILE IN HELL HOLES.  DEBT etc so funny.  NO JOBS ETC too.  or funding trillions to there MASTERS FAILED AIPAC LED instead so funny.
Liberals blame it on the Russians.
That&#39;s not a Self-driving Uber; it&#39;s an Alt-right Uber. It saw a black guy at the cross walk when the light was red, and it made a judgement call. It had to because these Alt-right Ubers claim they don&#39;t see colour.
Hi Charles can I copy this video onto vhs and melt the cassette live on csbnc?
if this death machine is allowed on the roads then why do i gotta take my test to get a licence😭😭
I like it, no fucks givin
fit for NYC
The best thing about this video was the   banner ad for Lyft 😂
<b>I can make it, there&#39;s no red light camera</b>
The only thing I got out of this video is I guess Volvo makes nice cars now.
Need more improvement. I still find it amazing the car didn&#39;t drive into any wall or tree
And now that snowflake passenger will need a safe space,  coloring books, pizza and crisis counselors.
wow a job were you literally do nothing, not even drive anymore. Also riding in this would give me so much anxiety I would probably just walk.
Looks like the fossil fuel industry is scared of the new car technology coming out.
i guess it is trending because it is rare to see this happen
hey charles ... you have good credit?
I have first hand experience with a Mobileye proximity scanner, and I can tell you that the tech is junk.
The only explanation is Russian hackers, at least thats what CNN has been telling me.
oops
Oh my god i got an ad for Uber before the video 😂😂😂
Still safer than any SF driver.
This is going to be one big mess.
I mean i would do the same.
That car was used for the tests in Napoli, so it clearly works
I present to you the future of transportation technology!!!
This is pointless
WTF - That&#39;s crazy!!
😂
How can u tell it was ubet
I couldn&#39;t tell who was the Uber.  Where is the red light because i can&#39;t see it
one death by an automated car and that&#39;s it, down the pan
must have had New york driver AI
very new technology these things will be ironed out until they&#39;re safer than normal cars (they probably already are tbh)
Wasn&#39;t even that bad
Cant believe how many people are defending self driving cars. I would never step in a car that relies on &quot;AI&quot; to get me to a destination. Sorry but humans can actually navigate and solve problems in real time on the road... AI will always run the risk of missing something or not reacting in an appropriate way given a high amount of variety in problems and conditions. Putting your life in the hands of a computer? No thanks.
It&#39;s amazing the number of people who defend Uber to the hilt.  I would not have thought a subsidised, unregulated, employment law flouting, taxi service could make people so blindly enamoured.  &quot;But it&#39;s well cheap though!!!&quot;
well it is in beta testing
Still more reliable than humans
Y&#39;all go sub and watch my channel it&#39;s really funny
I think it ran it because no pedestrians were in sight of the crosswalk
fake news
I will never trust these cars never!
It&#39;s funny because I got a lift ad right before this haha
Give the car a ticket
The technology is still in development. Not a surprise. Still safer than human drivers though.
it&#39;s programmed to stop for people
WHY THE HELL IS THIS TRENDING?
The Russians must have hacked it.
self driving uber out runs the cops
cannot be sure it was on autopilot. Maybe the driver was actually driving it at that time.
i suppose you could argue self driving cars are meant to ignore traffic lights because they dont need them. if they can totally sense their surroundings then the whole concept of traffic lights is pointless to them.
well now i know volvos autopilot is unsafe. lets stick with tesla
it was human error it had adriver in it
So a self driving car pulls up to a red light and realizes there is no reason it shouldn&#39;t keep going mean while your dumb ass is sitting at a red light waiting for nobody and nothing. Uber for the win
It could&#39;ve been a human behind the wheel.. in fact most of those cars are being tested now and they MUST have human drivers.
Yeeea- The world isn&#39;t ready for SelfDriving cars
&quot;OMG IT&#39;S A GHOST CAR!!!&quot;
Uber every where
BEEEBOOOOOBBEEEEEPPPP LEMME PASS YOU STUPID FLESSHY HOMAN, I&#39;M DA FUTUURREEE
The uber was the only one to stop tho lol
&quot;Self driving&quot; with a person sitting in the driver seat for legal purposes. He/she might have manually overridden the controls and blown the light.
can someone time stamp when it runs a red light? all i see is it stop before while all the humans run it?
Classic example of why human intelligence &quot;trumps&quot; artificial intelligence, at least in this case anyway.
and? there wasn&#39;t anything in danger
Hi John from the BBC, can we air this video with full credit to you , ok thanks.
I guess the passenger will get a ticket!?
Video is from a cab whose driver obviously could not wait to post this even though it is highly likely a human was 100% in control of the Uber vehicle at the time it ran the red light.
I&#39;d be speeding, running that red light cause i tried to chase the yellow and i would have given the cars in front of me a butta fly kiss....
thew trees were in the way
How do you know someone wasn&#39;t manually driving it?
uber has already said, &quot;“This incident was due to human error,” the statement read. “This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers. This vehicle was not part of the pilot and was not carrying customers. The driver involved has been suspended while we continue to investigate.”
it looks like all but the self-driving Uber car ran the red light
Just like a real taxi
An illegal car makes an illegal move on the road, which is worse?
I&#39;m almost certain that&#39;s a Volvo.
awkward
A weapon to surpass metal gear....
Is this not a cop car? Ahem someone just ran a red light...
What the hell are you talking about?  I must be missing something because it looked like it stopped to me.
ouh yeah Uber, you will get screwed big time. One class action lawsuit from 10000 customers and your billions in liabilities will just disappear and others will make money. listen to me Uber, If nobody fucking you, do not take your pants off.
Not really surprised when based off the driving skill of a GTA NPC.......
How did you come to the conclusion that it&#39;s self-driving?
It&#39;s going to be interesting the first time one of these kills someone. Who will be responsible? Uber? The carmaker? The company that makes the self driving technology? The &quot;Driver&quot; who isn&#39;t driving??? I don&#39;t want to be on the same street as one of those things!
Hey Charles I&#39;m from pornhub I was wondering if I Can use this video on the site and give you full credit thanks
woman programmer? 😂😂
How the hell is this viral? lol
The funny part is that there&#39;s an Uber ad bellow this video 😂
Where did it run a red light
&quot;IS IT THE LEGEND 27?&quot;
Who&#39;s to say it wasn&#39;t a human driver, driving the car? You cant see who&#39;s in the drivers seat. You cant even tell if it was driving self aware. Self driving cars have the option for a human driver  . . Don&#39;t be so quick to jump on this with out proof.
Uber: what is my purpose? <br>Rick: you run red lights.
It was being operated by driver and they have been suspended while Über investigates
Not only do you pay to be on the trending section, you can choose the position of the video too... nice
I knew it......Skynet is rising
Self driving cars will kill people. Said this when they first came out, said this when the first guy died from it, saying this now. Technology just isn&#39;t up fail safe yet.
Lmao ive seen this car too like around the same place haha I go to school next to MoMA
Finally, A Self-driving car after my own heart...
I don&#39;t see the problem here. The car was only imitating a real taxi driver...
I wonder how these cars will behave in the snow or ice roads.
Uber disables their comment section on the new self driving Uber video 😂
still drives better than uber drivers
Sweet now people can get even more lazy and fat....
Follow suit. Just like an AI.
Wonder how confused a cop would be if he tried to pull it over and give it a ticket 😂
Russians hacked the car. Or they hacked the light to turn red. They hack everything. CNN told me so.
Wow, the shortest yellow light ever.
It&#39;s self driving but did it have a passenger riding in it at the time it ran the red light? If that was me I&#39;d hope there would be some way to take control. I would be freaking out if that thing went rogue.
what&#39;s the payout if a woman hits you and it&#39;s their fault. are you covering Underwood insurance?
Uber Self-driving car crosses red light and the one that film it is a cab driver. Coincidence or a set up !!!!!!
Introducing self driving uber, we made it drive like an Asian.
Have ever heard of a gangster robot
It should say Uber self driving car stops while other drivers run red light. That&#39;s alot of red light tickets. all those plates
Oh no it made a mistake!!!!! Stop the presses... Who cares.   Nothing made by mans hand is flawless to start with..
How is this on trending
This is the same car that ran over the guy while &quot;self parking&quot;. The public did not sign up to be test dummies for these liberal wet dreams.
make me a compilation of humans running red lights
The A.I was probably Asian
These cars are not 100% driverless FYI, someone is in the front seat
bait click at its finest
From what I understand, there IS a driver behind the steering wheel, but the car can be driven by itself (just like a tesla).<br>So you&#39;re telling me these drivers just sit there (or even sleep) when I&#39;m riding at the back?
It was manual dumbass
Uber just told SF that they didn&#39;t need any official authorization to start using self-driving cars, so I guess they may also consider that red lights aren&#39;t for them.
Did it ever occur to you all that the human was driving? You can turn the self-driving off..
Ahead of its time
I am sure the reason it blew past the light was the Ped crossing was not programmed into the map and ignored the light since it was not a car intersection. But that brings up a whole new issue. what happens when construction changes the Road, does AI just Ignore the intersection changes because it is not programmed and people will be killed?  TRUMP WANTS TO SAVE JOBS...  STOP DRIVERLESS PUBLIC SERVICES...
shouldn&#39;t be a thing damn near hit a pedestrian already it&#39;s going to get worse
You could say &quot; Freeze All Motor Functions&quot; to solve the problem lol
damn siri learn how to drive bitch coulda killed someone
Why is this trending
Quick, somebody show Snowcat this, lol
sketch
loser...
Where does it run the red light exactly?
I&#39;m pretty sure the self driving cars detect cars and people, not traffic lights. If it ran a red light then I&#39;m sure it was safe for it to do so.
They train the AI models using footage of human drivers. Lots of people run red lights, so presumably some of the data going into the model contains people running red lights. The real question is, did it miss the red light? Or did it do it because it thought it could get away with it?!
Damn, Über sucks. Their business model and rules suck for the drivers. They are a terrible company that doesn&#39;t give a crap about people. And anyone who gets a &quot;self driving car&quot; is an idiot and will likely die or be injured for their foolishness.
Behold! the future
It has transcended human laws and now drives more efficiently. :P
Hello Charlie RAT I&#39;m working with Fibberson NewsCast, and my legal team would like to use your video with credit to YOU. WE AINT CREDITING LIQUOR CAB WE CREDITING YOU YOU CHICKEN FRY RICE
NOW HE HAS TO GIVE THE CAR A TICKET
Given how hidden that light was, I&#39;m not surprised.
Said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: WIFI/lidar/4G jammers. Why are people drinking this Uber kool-aid?
Why do people have the expectation that new technology like this is going to be flawless immediately? Its like people aren&#39;t aware that teams of software engineers have to work on projects like this for years and most of the problems won&#39;t appear until you actually starting testing it.
What a dick that self-driving car is...
Tweekers everywhere are going to start jumping in front of these things, it&#39;ll be like winning the trailer park lottery.
ban it
This is what happens when you let chinese people build self-driving cars.
Should change the name of their company to &quot;Christine&quot;
still better than some drivers
why the fuck are people in this comment section defending the car/company?? lmao it ran a red light, they need to fix their shit cuz that is dangerous
subsribe or your mom dies
I&#39;m with Shitty Fucking news, I was wondering if you could contact us so we can take your footage and pass it as ours, fuck you and have a nice day
We should have self-driving police cars to go after these rogue self-driving cars and give them an automated tickets that the cars will automatically pay using it&#39;s automatic payment method..
I got an über ad at the beginning lol
This particular model has a Chinese lady AI
Wait... We have self driving cars!
I&#39;m betting the placement of the traffic light are an issue here. even i didnt see them at first. wierd place to put those
Oh shit Uber u is giving ur self a bad name! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23runningared">#RunningARed</a>
Even in the future nothing works!
So are we still trusting self driving vehicles?
Uber should be sued asap.
actually that was me driving.  aint nobody got time for a red light
And that is why you shouldn&#39;t trust technology
Wouldn&#39;t be an Uber experience without it
AI lives matter
How many people run a red light a day? Thousands, and when a self driving car does it for the first time hits the trending page. Makes sense. Fucked up world
It is what it is now, but it&#39;s guaranteed that in ten years time these will be all over the place and I welcome it.
There is absolutely NO LOGICAL REASON why we should have cars driving themselves! It&#39;s too dangerous! What&#39;s going to happen when an Uber car runs a red light and ends up killing someone? It will just be another case of an accidental, yet unnecessary death of a loved one(s) where the family will sue Uber and their stupid cars will be pulled off the road... BUT INSTEAD, they could just stop being stupid morons (Uber) and prevent the accidents by not thinking that a man made car with its own mind can be safe!
To be fair those traffic lights are really not in standard positions.
I don&#39;t see anything running a red light.
on
Hahahaha 5 minutes ago I saw the Uber video, and now this! xd
The comments on here are hilarious.
We need these because:<br>1. Computers NEVER fail<br>2. We all hate driving and can’t do it<br>3. We have no other, more pressing problems<br>4. Nerds like them.<br><br>One of these is true.
That pause before the uber car goes is brilliant. Comic timing at its finest.
I&#39;m glad to see they programmed it to behave identically like a live Uber driver.
You assume that just because it had the hardware on top of it that it is an Uber and you assumed that it was driving by itself. You&#39;d be wrong.
Apparently this is a joke to ya&#39;ll, but there was a person in the crosswalk who could&#39;ve been killed had this happened a few seconds later.
How do the police pull over an automated vehicle when it breaks basic traffic laws?
Driving around in a driverless uber car - Nerd Alert!
how can this be? who&#39;s responsible if an accident/ death happens?
it didnt even run the light
Am I an idiot?  Which one is the uber?  Also where is the proof that it&#39;s self driving?
I thought only Russians had dash cams?
What do you expect from an inferior uber car? This tech will take another ten years to develop properly.
I like how Uber is advertising it on YouTube, but they disable the comments and like lmao
Humans run red light, Get a ticket and everyone is cool<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Uber runs a light and it makes national news.
this video is so stupid
you know, self driving cars don&#39;t need to be perfect driver since humans aren&#39;t perfect drivers either.
wow this video is wild
Still a better driver than anyone else I know.
Uber said that this was due to human error.
The crosswalk only had FIVE red lights. Uber only recognizes six or more.
eh, there is a 3 second window before other lights turn green. i do that shit all the time even in front of cops its fine if u live in a city.  in the suburbs dickhead cops might ticket u for that.
Hey Charles do u mind if I watch this video with my eyes? I can give you full credit but I just want to watch it. Thanks in advance.
The people in the car probably freaked out, but couldnt get out.
Which one is the fucking uber
Ha! This is now higher than the Self-Driving Uber Ad in the trending section. <br><br>Terrible timing, it was probably the operators fault, too.
I&#39;m pretty sure the AI is still better than 75% of drivers in the U.S.
This has got to be the most anti-climatic thing I have ever watched
They will kill people and get away with it. Just like all corporations and politicians. They are the same actually, once you get to the 1% level.
Oh my god, an Self Driving car did something a normal ass hole human being would do, despicable.
ai is communist filth
probably is the Asian
Blame Skynet!
poop sack magie
I imagine this was a female AI.
it was probably optimised to focus on safety over law.
Lmfao and the DMV in Cali just proclaimed this service illegal.  Good.
Hey babe you need more body wash right?
It&#39;s a start. Eventually all cars are gonna be self-driving cars, it&#39;s gonna be like those cars in the movie iRobot.
whoever liked this is letting youtube put bull shit as #5 on trending <br>this shit shouldnt even been seen on reccommended
the fuck I care for, I run a red every other week, don&#39;t worry about the cars worry about me
GPS is wrong everyday.  What happens when the car kidnaps you to the wrong location?
Car Lives Matter!!! Wheels Up!!
fucking robots man... they&#39;re coming for you, america... you just wait
No liability to see here folks! Keep moving along.... Nothing to see...
It&#39;s gonna freak me out when I&#39;m at a light, look at the car to the right and see no one driving
Who pays the ticket?
It is the 1st model of course there are going to be issues
hahaha fuck road laws
is it actually running the red light?
???????????????????????????????????????Trending??????
Self driving cars are bullshit. Technology is too buggy. Updates and patches.. The computer crashes.. then you do 😣
see the man in the crosswalk, the Uber could have struck him.
Are people really too lazy to fucking drive themselves?
Hi charles, im with PORNHUB BAY AREA im going to use your video without permission for our latest movie called GRAB HER BY DA PUSSY (self driving Uber Edition) k thanx.
This is why I keep telling everyone self driving ANYTHING is a big mistake. Don&#39;t you want a human supervising something that can potentially kill you?
Just wait till these things run someone over then drag them for miles.
Isn&#39;t there still someone in control of the car at this point?
It&#39;s learning our ways. Soon it&#39;ll be flipping you off and tailgating. They grow up so fast.
watergate that uber jeez
I&#39;m more of a Waymo kinda guy.
Who else is here before this song goes viral??
P
When a Tesla Model 3 says &quot;nobody&#39;s home&quot;......
At least someone is working their ass off to make this technology happen and make the world better. What are we doing to make the world a better place... oh yeah NOTHING
Ohhhhh
When did the car run a red light?
Looks like those self driving Ubers still need a bit of work
So who gets the ticket? The car?
You&#39;re in a Johnny Cab.  We hope you enjoyed the ride!
i wish that car would run me over
If that pedestrian got hit he would&#39;ve been rich af
Well that didn&#39;t last long.
so who do they write the ticket to
Snitch
It wouldn&#39;t have hit anyone
عربي جزائري مر من هذا الطريق، اشتركوا في قتاتي الله يحفضكم ♥♥♥♥♥♥
Who the fuck cares
Driverless vehicles need to be banned in each city! Just the idea of this is absolutely ridiculous!!! Actually putting it into action takes it to a whole new level of STUPID!
Watch this get millions of views.
cop pulls it over: license and registra- wha?
Is this click-bate because it stopped at the red light? Or
LOL
It had the right of way
lol I got an ad for Uber on this vid haha
Uber sketchy as always
smh why are we making self driving cars a thing
It looks you stopped at the red light so not sure what the issue is
oh my god this is south of market district in san francisco
The future is here and it still doesn&#39;t work as advertised
lol, I didn&#39;t see that in the uber commercial that is treading right now
Oh dear.
It would of been a good idea to have the driver at least have control of acceleration , brakes , and reverse. IMO
Humans run red lights all the time and nobody cares, but when an artificial intelligence does it, its all over the news. racism in America is alive and well.
robot rebellion!
will these vehicles pull over at the sound of sirens?
it had to be a volvo
WOOPS LITTLE BUGGY
Trump as president, driverless cars, drone package delivery, beer IVs.....we are definitely in the future.
Hi Charles.<br>I&#39;m gathering data to prove self driving cars are a major issue and would like to use your video as further evidence.
Oh no. Their gaining independent thinking. Quick! Hide your cars before they get pregnant!
ROBOTS ALREADY TAKING OVER THE WORLD!!!
This was s human running a red light, not an automated system as found out last night.
The Cyberdyne Systems machine saw that there was no human harm to run the light, lights are for humans.
Lol
Its just a car running a red light whats the deal?
It was hacked from Russia.
if your a cop how do you pull over a self drive car?
Turns out it was a person driving in that car and Op is a taxi driver.
Let&#39;s be honest here most drivers would have done no differently.
Uber doesn&#39;t allow comments on its video so I have to post here:<br><br>Uber Driverless, now with realistic &quot;it&#39;s was yellow when I started crossing&quot; AI.
SMART CAR JOINED ISLAM....YOU SEE THAT INFIDEL THAT WAS ALMOST CAR-VERTED?
its the tip of the iceberg, wait till it mows some poor fucker down in broad daylight then  the shit will hit the fan bigtime....
photoshopped!....lol!
I don&#39;t understand. Isn&#39;t this how Uber drivers normally drive?
Should we start posting YouTube videos when people run red lights?
Which ones the self driving Uber car?
Those self driving cars are rebels
This some bullshit
There&#39;s 1% chance of fucking up and this is that.
Would you get in a driverless car and just let it take you for a joy ride? No human will be watching for those millions of other little stupid things and every day the car could go off track and just slowly start crunching crowds of people under its wheels and there will be nothing you can do but go along for the ride and at the end of the day everyone&#39;s going to blame you for getting in the thing to begin with
10 seconds in, you can clearly see someone in the drivers seat. This is just a human chump jumping a red light...
I like how there&#39;s a Lytf ad for Uber running red light video
You are going to see the first case of a poor car being raped in the middle of the night because it was out driving around alone in a bad neighborhood
That man was lucky, looks like the pedestrian stop isn&#39;t on their database.
Technically we don&#39;t know if this was the computer driving or the human driver taking over to run the light and save himself time.
So if you&#39;re in the car as a passenger and it starts doing this shit are going to be a big red button to kill the engine? Should I carry a hammer with me just to make sure I can get out the window?
THE MACHINES ARE TAKING OVER
Cop: &quot;Sir, show me you licen-, God Damn it! not again!!&quot;
It&#39;s a rolling death box designed to take out the unaware it&#39;s kind of like a suicide booth once enough organic beings have been sacrificed its programming will be perfected
I like how the video is dated  3 weeks before the car was actually out on the road ;)
Guess uber is not liable if runs over people... they not liable when chicks get raped
It&#39;s the next level of cell phone death not enough people are being hurt by distracted drivers so we just need a chunk of steel wheels and auto pilot out there rolling around
Well well well
I don&#39;t get it
Boo fucking hoo. One red light. Do you understand how bad HUMANS are at driving? Literally 95% of accidents are human error and can be fixed with ai. The ai is not perfect but it&#39;s way better than shitty human reactions. One video and one death from ai is better than the thousands of people being killed right now by humans being drunk, not paying attention, etc
Funny thing is that those cars still haw someone sitting behind the wheel and the car nor that person stopped at that light lol. Such a stupid idea, let&#39;s have a car that drives itself but still put a person behind the wheel....... So why not just drive the fucking car then??? Durrrrrrrr
I robot is happening next
Calculating...................stop now-recalculating........
How do you know someone wasn&#39;t driving it manually? Lol.
