You guys know this footage is fake right lmao
Morons
Question : how many apes are there in this video ?
This is why Africa needs to stop it with all the wars it has. Rebellions, Revolutions, Civil Wars, Insurgencies, Partisans, Military Dictators, Coups. Now it&#39;s affecting the Continent&#39;s wildlife as it is towards civilians.
thats my cousin hes from Afghanistan.

Oh shi. ITS NOW ARABIC.
“where your gun?”<br>“a monkey stole it”<br>“what? one of the soldiers stole it?”<br>“wait what”
Chicago getting ruff.
And this is how Palworld was born
&quot;friendly fire is not tolerated&quot;
This is TONY MONTANA ,he is reborn as a CHIMP 😅

The rise of the planet of the apes!!! 🇺🇸
Whole scene is remarkably reminiscent of the way cutscenes in Far Cry games are presented.

This reminds me of dawn of the planet of the apes when Koba starts to shoot the soldiers with guns.
Dude the victory pose at the end
Planet of the apes.

bravo vince!
Balls
Reminds me of the Ukrainians when they still had nuclear weapons.
This is so fake because the bolt carrier isn&#39;t even resprecating to extract the casing, so that just makes it automatically fake.
Palworld be like: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhxqIITtTtU&amp;t=27">0:27</a>
&quot;It was at this moment that the monke became American&quot;
😂😂😂😂
Ooohh so this is what inspired Palworld
A Brazilian &quot;tourist&quot; gets handed a weapon by African paramilitary soldiers who did not know any better, circa 2009, colorized.
Ok
And this is how planet of the apes got started 😅
Is that the real life Koba (Dawn of the planet of the Apes)
Honestly cute, BUT those guys probably cut the poor thing&#39;s limbs of and tossed it away
Nah Bro Really Said, What&#39;s This Weird Shape Do?? Ohhh Yes Its An Ak-47 Loaded With 7.62x39mm Rounds Capable Of Firing 600 to 700 RPM Using A Steel, Wood And Polymer Body And I Am Fully Capable Of Handling The 6 - 7 KG Of Recoil Force Considering The Fact That I Am A Small Ape.. Yes.
❤😂
How did all those monkeys get those guns?
Это постанова😂😂😂
This is how the Planet of the Apes came to be!

Humans: our relative primates can’t get that intelligent right?
It&#39;s like Slippin Jimmy with a law degree.
We can&#39;t tell who is an ape.

“Don’t shoot those are our guys!” - 🐒
That CIA skag is pretty powerful stuff.
oh great,  he&#39;s at least twice as strong as any one of them, and some wants to give him a gun.
Well, that’s what happens when you literally hand over a deadly weapon to a pair of inexperienced hands. He or she is in a worse position than even a child. A child could at least have it explained to them that a gun is dangerous and never to be played with lightly. That ape would not be able to understand. He or she likely has no idea what they’re doing or how they could hurt the men.<br>I’d say it’s one hundred percent their fault.
You’re slipping jimmy! and slipping jimmy I can handle just fine but slipping jimmy with a law degree is like-
Hehe, it&#39;s Furious George
Nina hartley nude hairy
And to think this was movie promo for Rise of the Planet of the Apes

I watch this every six months whether I need a laugh or not
umm it isnt really ok to call them that but good vid
Planet of the apes is a reality now
The seeded blood type 0&#39;s of Africa have an embedded gangster fearless mentality mindset most likely from their original animal primate form being. There however, seems to be more mentally and physically relaxed blood type 0&#39;s non-African, that seem more mentally relaxed, more physically relaxed. The likes of Bumblebee Blood Type 0&#39;s, possibly also the Latin American blood type 0&#39;s. This is aside from them getting a Zionist or 666 Decepticon infection. As they all turn fearl after such Zionist or 666 Decepticon infection/virus.
The way he received the gun : assault weapon aquired
Legends say that he is out there fighting for the Apes
&quot;eastern dictators&quot; perfect specimen.<br>Loyal, and willing to destroy what is being told.<br><br>It&#39;s not fun. AT ALL.
This was really well made
...the amount of dent heads in the comments who think is is real proves a staggering decline in intelligence, just in the last 12 years.

This footage never gets old.
Fear of a chimp planet
Long before time had a name, Ninjago was created by the First Spinjitzu Master, using the Four Weapons of Spinjitzu. The Scythe of Quakes, the Nunchucks of Lightning, the Shurikens of Ice and the Sword of Fire. Weapons so powerful, no one can handle all of their power at once! When he passed away, his two sons swore to protect them, but the oldest was consumed by darkness and wanted to possess them. A battle between brothers broke out, and the oldest was struck down and banished to the Underworld. Peace returned, and the younger brother hid the weapons, but knowing his older brother&#39;s relentless ambition for power, he placed a guardian to protect them. And for fear of his own demise, a map for an honest man to hide. That honest man was your father. The older brother is Lord Garmadon, and I... need to find those weapons before he does
He Said &quot;I Am The Chosen One&quot;
Where is the ape in this video??
Average ape in West Africa
Literal brass monkey
What
Reminds me of planet apes
They do the very same thing in Feruson,,Mo, Atlanta, Detroit, LA, and many other cities in the US.  The wisest thing to do is to keep guns out of the hands of primates.
Monkey Around &amp; Find Out!
&quot;Slippin jimmy I can handle just fine, but Slippin with a law degree is like a chimp with a machine gun&quot;

There are smart monkeys, and there are stupid monkeys...
Looks like Detroit

Monkey is comrade
Da ih je bar pobio.
Hé is more sensible than the asses around him.
Leave it to black people.

The time has come! Somebody call Joe Rogan!
Well, the chimp has more brains than anyone else who carries one of those guns.
Like moth to a flame
Not so fun when the monkey got the gun 👀
Planet of the Apes cancelled prequel
😂😂😂
&quot;&quot;&quot;From this video we Learn that we shouldn&#39;t go that jungle without vest beacuse legend says that he is waiting with his gun still now&quot;&quot;&quot;
It&#39;s all fun, games and mockery until the monkey is armed...<br>Then play time is OVER 🐒🐒🐒
Bro got his victory 💀
i see a bunch of apes with guns
Which one?
Looks like every Repube out there with a commercial with a gun
Camera man had invisible portion, hence proved
“ it’s so easy a child could use it” “maybe a monkey too”
Gangsta&#39;s paradise
How nice of the ape, to share his loud stick toy with the curious little furry creature
Fake fake fake fake fake. <br>I can point out half a million things wrong here. But I&#39;ll just go with 2...<br>Number 1: there&#39;s no recoil on the AK 47, everyone who knows a little about firearms know that an AK kicks like a mule.<br>Number 2: the sound that the weapon made, it&#39;s a dead give away.
Real rise of the planet apes
That&#39;s was so hilarious 😂
That to see Saul still practicing law
Is this real
Tous des singes !
Teacher : what comes before 47.<br>Gorrila : AK 😂

That&#39;s funny. There&#39;s really not much difference between the monkey and the people that live there. They are basically the same.
Cameraman never dies 🤣🤣🤣
Ape deserve Oscar 😅<br>Khatarnak 🔥😂
Hahaha looks like an @f®¡©@|\| American holding an ak 47 out in the hood demanding 🍉 and chicken wings hahaha 🤭😂
Intelligence was clearly not a requirement in that army..., the ape learned them a lesson.... What is even more surprising to me is that he fired 2 rounds in the ground... as if he knew how deadly this could be..., if this video id real, that is...
Манке оказался умнее
На что они расчитывали?

mokes playin with guns. dangerous stuff
Monkeys are so intelligent!!! <br>1: Was friendly to a different species even though they could fight.<br>2: Shot at the ground below everyone as they know the bullet trajectory.<br>3: Kept the entire encounter as a joke and never proceeded to kill anyone.<br>4: Mimic local soldier victory movement.<br>WOW!!! 😂😂
You mean apes
Monkey with monkeys
This may be the real world sezar
It&#39;s unbelievable, did this really happen or is it a scene from a movie, but if it&#39;s real, they can do very dangerous things and they are very smart. 😯😧☺️😉

Good spray pattern, form and controlled the recoil. Give em marksman badge asap
Why does that unsurpressed AK sound like that? 😂

Bro turned from funny cameo to main character in 40 seconds.
Africans (bantu / n e e g ro, a once tiny race which originated from Nigeria 2,000 years ago), colonised the entire sub Saharan Africa, wiping out ALL the indigenous tribes and races like the Hadza, Sandawe, Pygmy, San etc. This is proven beyond doubt by linguistics and DNA. Blacks are now busy colonising and replacing populations in the West! Wake up.
This is how they create more Republicans in America!
Which one?
I see 5 apes instead of 1
There wasn&#39;t only one ape with a gun
There now is a new king of the jungle.
That chimp has better trigger discipline than some people I know...
All fun and games 😊🔥
Victory is Mine!!!<br>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❣
ouh ouh
Later that day he fucked some others apes bitches
Monkey was like &quot;FUCK YES&quot;

The chimp has more of a right to hold an automatic weapon than them.
LOL! I still dont think they learned their lesson!😂

Ummmm. <br><br>How can I make this a non racial joke?<br><br>🤔🤔<br><br>Not sure it can be done in 2023 but I’ll try. <br><br>I call any idiot with a gun an ape. <br><br>Lemme go back. I call idiots apes. Monkeys, baboons etc etc… <br><br>So I’ll now try be politically correct and ruin what would have been a funny joke or at least anecdotally. <br><br>“Which one is the ape” <br><br>Leave me alone Dumar…
Real life Koba!
That ape is really the king of the jungle 💀
Love how people think this is real. Must not be american if they think that is what a gun being fired that close sounds like.

These monkeys are as stupid as we all know.......oh, I don&#39;t mean the one chimp.
Rambo its coming 🤣🤣🤣
I love how he raised the AK above his head as he won. The future is now old men, return to monke...
Лишний раз показали, что человек не хомо сапиенс... Увы...
The other fun one was to give a chimp a grenade then put them in a conex container and take bets on how long until they figured it out.
The beginning made me think the title of the video was a very racist joke.
And that kids, is how the Planet of the Apes started
🤣🤣🤣 Їбануті негри🤣🤣🤣
<b>WHO IS IMITATING WHO?</b>
Suspicious George
Lol
I’d arm every last one of them in America and tell them take what the racist took from you.

They were just training a new recruit into their A pe army.

Guerilla warfare is a little different in Africa
How did they know what Chicago in 2023 would be like?!?!

А ведь обезьяна направляла автомат и стреляла фактически не обучаясь, а представьте что будет, если обезьян учить пользоваться оружием

pmc wagner
Since all humans are biologically classified as Hominidae which are great apes as well, I guess this title needs a change. There are apes who jump around and give one smaller ape a gun.
This is not funny people, black on black crime needs to stop.
This has to be staged. There&#39;s no way a person is stupid enough to give a chimp a loaded weapon while everything is recorded so smoothly.<br><br>Edit: Whatever, I want it to be real haha
That&#39;s how Ceaser ancestors were Born.
&quot;Giving women rights is like giving a gun to a monkey&quot; so this is what he meant.
