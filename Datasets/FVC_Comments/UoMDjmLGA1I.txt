Far cry 4 in nutshell
Jeez, someone died?!
He is so cute
This is funny and sad at the same time
Who&#39;s playing Jumanji?
In America, people complain about morning traffic. Meanwhile in Nepal, people get chased by Rhino on the way to work. <br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23livelifelikeitsyourlastday">#livelifelikeitsyourlastday</a> 🛵 🦏

That&#39;s not even a bike, it&#39;s a scooty which is gearless and doesn&#39;t even go above 60 kmph....a rhino can easily catch it...wonder what happened to those riders.
E você reclamando quando o cachorro da sua rua corre atrás da sua moto
SHIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
See what happens when you play jumanji!
Every time I watch this video I think of Far Cry 4 because of the rhino, the rhino chasing the vehicle and the fact that it&#39;s in Nepal.😂

I like rhinos and all, but can you imagine how much it must stink to like in a country with them? We might complain about squirrels or deer. these guys have to worry about freaking rhinos getting in their tomato plants!!!!
Why them bitches so damn fast!

WTF moments
Jaki fajny, a jak fajnie biegał.  Co za urocze zwierzątko nasłał bym go... a gdzieś bym go nasłał.  
china
man look at the speed of the rhino. it runs as fast as the motorcycle even though it&#39;s so huge. by the way shit country nepal
That would be scary
The wording for this video is just another example of how we vilify wildlife. It did not have &#39;destruction on its mind&#39; but rather was most likely stressed and scared of being in a strange and alien environment. The death of a person is very unfortunate and highlights how more education is needed to provide people in potential encounter areas with guidelines on how to react to this situation.
Must have been playing jumanji
Lol :D
Frankie was right all along...
The bike rider was like &#39;fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu&#39;

Well...at least one road user knows what his horn is for!
It&#39;s not  Rhino entering town , it is towns entering rhino habitat.
I guarantee that woman&#39;s shouting in the background was helping the situation in absolutely zero ways
