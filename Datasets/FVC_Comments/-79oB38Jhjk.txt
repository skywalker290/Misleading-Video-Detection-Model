ATTENTION YOUTUBE VIEWERS READ THIS BEFORE YOU COMMENT:<br>Buy Pearson Brothers Private Reserve Saccharo first. <br><a href="http://pearsonbrotherswinery.com/">Pearsonbrotherswinery.com</a><br>1.  The Shark Lives at the end of the video.  If you watch the video till the end you find out it does.<br>2.  This was filmed in a REMOTE AREA OF BAJA CA, MEXICO, 1HOUR DRIVE TO THE NEAREST SERVICES.  THERE IS NO PHONE SERVICE OF ANY KIND.  YOU CAN NOT CALL ANYONE FOR HELP.<br>3.  The shark never stopped moving for over 3 minutes.  It had total control over where it was and how deep of water it was in.<br>4.  After 30 minutes in the shallow water the Shark SWAM AWAY UNDER ITS OWN POWER AND WAS SEEN FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS.  AGAIN THE SHARK SWAM AWAY AFTER 30 MINUTES.<br>5.  The darkness in the water is from sand and mud on the bottom being stirred up from its tail.  Its not blood.<br>6.  The Video was reviewed by Science Professionals in Great White Shark Research and they determined that the injury was not lethal and that the Shark would recover.<br>7.  The Shark was  NEVER TOUCHED, RESTRAINED, HARASSED, REDIRECTED, OR BOTHERED IN ANY WAY BY ME OR THE PEOPLE THERE.<br>8.  THE INJURY WAS ON THE SHARK WHEN IT SWAM INTO THE COVE.  WE DID NOT CAUSE THE INJURY, WE ONLY DOCUMENTED IT.<br>9.  PHD White Shark Researchers after reviewing this video concluded that the Great White Shark was in the shallow water because it was hunting for stingrays as a food source.  This means that what appears to be a helpless injured Shark is in reality a FEEDING 15FT PREDATOR IN ITS OWN NATURAL HUNTING ENVIRONMENT.  TRYING TO &quot;HELP&quot; THIS MASSIVE PREDATOR BECAUSE OF ITS INJURY WOULD HAVE BEEN FOOLISH, AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY TO THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE TRIED.<br><br><br>ALL 3 PEOPLE IN THE WATER THAT DAY RECIEVED INJURIES FROM STINGRAYS.  AFTER WEEKS OF ANTIBIOTICS AND MEDICATIONS THEY WILL RECOVER.<br><br>WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER A 15 FT WHITE SHARK IN SHALLOW WATER, DO NOT TRY AND HELP IT.  CHANCES ARE IT DOSEN&#39;T NEED YOUR HELP AND YOU WILL ONLY CREATE A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE ANIMAL AND YOURSELF.
No mames
&quot;He&#39;s mortally wounded.&quot; It turns out the shark was just hunting.
Vous condamnez le Hamas ?<br>Le Hamas , vous le condamnez ?
He tried to touch its helmet
That’s so tragic
Poor thing,hope its ok 😢
Incredibly good story, you really great guys, good work  ✌️🇺🇸
This guy need to commentate every animal doc ever
Why in the name of God would you get that close to a great white? That&#39;s asking for trouble
Stupid<br>-Adjective <br>-Lacking in wisdom/judgement<br>-Walking right up to a hunting great white in the water
Poor thing I hope he’s still living? X
Great footage guys 👍
And where exactly in Baja California or surrounding was this? Cmon say exactly where it was please
Nobody:<br>White people:C’mon we gotta go put it back where it belongs
“He’s bleeding out!”  There’s no blood whatsoever
Hahahah she said “what’s with all the stingrays in the water” lol  ⚰️
Por fin veo un vídeo en el que alguien se atreve a ayudar a un pobre tiburón en vez de no hacer nada y solamente grabarlo, bravo por ello, todavía queda gente valiente y hospitalaria👏👏
The shark made it and learned some new colorful lingo. He returned to his homies like: &quot;Bro I was hit by a propeller. Holy shit it hurt.  Fuck me runnin..err..I mean swimmin!&quot;
Dorsal fin is over 2 feet no doubt
Big Fucking white shark is right
🙏♥️🙏♥️
Boggles my mind how someone can see a shark like that and run towards it, I was honestly hoping the dude won the Darwin award for his stupidity, would have been well earned.<br><br>It&#39;s not brave it&#39;s not courageous, it&#39;s outright stupidity.<br><br>Cameras have a zoom function, you don&#39;t physically have to get within feet of it, to get a good shot.
Its not hunting! Its stranded in shallow water. Poor shark
I remember seeing this in person down in San Felipe. My friends and I were lying in the sun and as I was gazing out in the water I saw a huge silhouette in the water and ran down to the water to get a better look. Sure enough, it was a white shark coasting by no more than 5mph. I followed it on a golf cart for a mile before the terrain became too rocky to continue. The waters there are very fertile, my friend and I went fishing on a little tin boat the day before. Its mad this video got 42M views!
Poor thing I hope he didn’t suffer too much
Please don&#39;t reference the S word with God&#39;s Holy Word in love!
Great to find the original video with explanation at the end. Glad it survived. Your brave to get that close to it. Poor bugger. G&#39;day from Aus 🇦🇺
Imagine getting attacked by this shark. It be like getting hit by a truck with teeth.
Dale is an absolute bad ass, confirmed!
Why would you pull it in? Leave it alone. Let it die in piece
It&#39;s an elaborate ruse by the shark because he wanted a human shaped snack
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=114">1:54</a> I laughed when I put the subtitles on and YouTube simply wrote: Allah
What possessed him not only stay in the water, but to go towards it
Suicidal much?
LIKE I SAID..NEVER GO IN THE WATER WITHOUT THE RUBBERS...ALL THAT STIRRED UP SAND..MUST OF WOKE UP THE RAYS..
Stop the SWEARING!! AND IT&#39;S GONNA MAKE IT...GREAT WHITE LIKE THAT...IT&#39;S BUILT TOUGH...
ALWAYS WEAR YOUR RUBBER BOOTS WHEN TRYING TO SAVE A SHARK OR WHALE...ESPECIALLY WHEN STINGRAYS ARE AROUND...
Have these people not seen Deep Blue Sea?!
Que seres idiotas! O tubarão é mais inteligente que todos eles juntos. Faltou ele dizer saiam e me deixem em paz seus panacas.
I hope it&#39;s ok
Just came here to read all the expert comments
That shark literally swam around just to have a look.  Dark black yes (the devils eyes)
I’m stung bro 😂
You’re like the CNN of wildlife lol you say a lot of misinformation about what’s going on
How would it catch anything with all that thrashing around. You think all that movement would scare away potential prey
This is going to seem ridiculous but could this be the Black Demon of the Sea of Cortez? This Great White seems darker than usual?
U guys are fucking idiots. This shark has a wound on its back, as u discovered. First of all, ur throwing ur life away by going so close, and 2nd of all, THE SHARK IS KEEPING HIS WOUND OUT OF THE SALT WATER BECAUSE IT BURNS AS WE KNOW. THIS IS THE REASON HE‘S ON THE SHORE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=31">0:31</a> and that&#39;s a f#@king idiot walking  towards the white shark!
Man humans suck!!!! We just kill everything!!! Each other, all wildlife, and the earth!!!
All 3 people in the video get wounded by stingrays, pretty funny
Shark wounded... <br>Humans : no... Focus on my stingrays sting wound
😂😂😂😂 he said CHALE 😅
Shuffle feet in shallow water
No one in the comments watched the whole video. 🤦‍♂️<br><br><br><br><br>Or read the pinned comment
At around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=240">4:00</a>, it turns around and then lifts it’s head outta the water to get a peek at what is screaming and saying holy shyt over and over. Also, sharks are super resilient, tenacious and have almost comic book like regenerative powers. It is not mortally wounded by the scratch on its back. It was probably hunting sting rays and got caught by the low tide
wonder who the hell dislikes this video, never seen footage like that....
Put it out of its misery and get the grips out them teeth are worth 600 dollars each
I&#39;m not one of those people that says humans are never on the menu for Great Whites. Because we absolutely have been and will be again. But I will say that we are not something that they care to feed on with any type of regularity.. even if you&#39;re one of those conspiracy theorists that think that the entire world is hiding the true amount of attacks, which is complete bullshit, there is never a day that there are not great whites within ten feet of people probably hundreds of times worldwide. If we truly were something that a great white wanted to eat as a commonplace in their diet, there would be attacks every single day multiple times a day all across the world. I mean there&#39;s just one single guy that has a channel on YouTube where he uses a drone to film great white swimming right by human beings. Just one person. There are thousands of great whites within feet of people everyday. If they wanted to eat us, we are absolutely inferior within the water and would be easy prey. They could eat Us by the dozens every day. Yet there&#39;s only a handful of attacks worldwide and even less fatalities. And of those fatalities very rarely are we actually eating. And yes I&#39;ve seen the video of the guy in Australia I didn&#39;t say that we never get eaten I just said that generally that&#39;s not the case. But let&#39;s just say that you&#39;re tinfoil-hat beliefs are correct and they are hiding shark attacks. Let&#39;s say instead of the 2-5 fatal great white attacks that we had in a year they lied and there was actually 50. Now that is being insanely generous. That is granting an outrageous number of hidden fatalities. That&#39;s still only 50 fatalities out of the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of opportunities that a great white would have at humans every year. That&#39;s nothing. There would be frequent fatalities every single day every single year all over the world many many many times per day if they truly wanted to eat us.
HELLO ..BRUCE...How&#39;s HOOPER doing these Days??🤗🤗😂😂
It&#39;s As BIG AS A CADILLAC!!😱😱😱😱
ALWAYS REMEMBER TO WEAR BOOTS when you&#39;re in the Beach for A SITUATION like this...
The Mexican guy was stunged by the stingray &quot;Immediately starts talking shit&quot; 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=220">3:40</a>
We&#39;re seeing some shit we ain&#39;t never seen before, Jay!
People in here complaining about the cussing 😂This seems like the correct amount of shark to curse words ratio.
The critters beached and needs help
Where did it happened?
Terrible, nobody help to this poor shark, she lost a lot of blood...
Poor shark I hate that people are so careless. I hope he or she survived. Between the carelessness of others and the pair of orcas killing great whites for their liver and leaving the body. Scientists are still trying to figure out why. One thought recently and I think they&#39;re right it&#39;s their food supply being affected by overfishing they leave an area where food is more easily found and the orcas are going after another source for liver and fatty acids.  I&#39;m also worried for a great white female named Deep Blue she&#39;s about 20 feet long possibly one of the oldest but also the largest she recently had offspring she is very scarred from battles and mating. She is also the most gentle over 1000 people have swam with her she&#39;s a beauty she&#39;s so huge. Only professional shark drivers swim with her. Look her up there are many images of her. She stays out in deep ocean only.

Why is he wading when a large shark is thrashing around not far away??? Hmmmm......what could be the problem with that??
still one of the coolest videos ever
Nenadávaj a choď mu pomôcť
It would be cool to watch this video without listening to this guys annoying commentary the whole time.  I actually feel sorry for that Great White.  He looks very injured.
This guy nuts
The only thing that really bothers me about this video is your filthy mouth. Seriously do you really need to drop the F word ? There maybe kids watching and I’m sure you could use better language.
Stop blaspheming and try to get the shark some help...
As an Aussie this is just hilarious except for the sharks&#39; story. Just push it out like everyone else does then &quot;bro,dude,ow,man&quot; together. Ray stings do suck but they aren&#39;t bad. For me it&#39;s been 1 - Stonefish (boat ramp) 2 Bluebottle/Man-O-War (surfing) and 3 - Ray strike to the heel (fishing).

Wow too close for comfort!
Absolutely beautiful animal I hope it made it
Selfie with shark.<br>Mission accomplished.<br>Well done.
Where a mako when you what on???
The same size that ate the guy in Australia in February 2022 .....
Shark was asking for help😭
booshet! That&#39;s a black shark!
What an absolutely amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience. She was so beautiful. I hope she made it! Its amazing the strength and energy she had even being hurt and god knows what else shed been through and the fact that she seemed totally unbothered by him. Great footage! Hope that sting ray sting is better. Luckily I haven&#39;t been got yet but more jelly fish stings than I care to think about
you know what else they go after when they are injured or sick.  humans 🤣 probably was after you lol.  there was an attack where a woman got bit in half in 3 feet of water on a beach with like 20 other people within 50 feet.
you are pretty dam stupid dude
As intelligent as these guys are, it is fascinating they make it out of their beds everyday without accident.
🤣🤣 I&#39;m hit bro.
I dont think its a guarentee that it would die if left alone
I can’t get over their voices lol
Она же не белая
THATS A BIG BOY RIGHT THERE. 1
&quot;Crocy! What do we have here. It&#39;s alright little fella I&#39;m not going to hurt you. Woooow look at the teeth on that thing!&quot; 🦘
Oh wowwww he got hit bye a boat... Poor Baby
He gonna remember you and come back to get you 😂😂😂😂😂😂
How many times can someone say holly shit 😂
Iono what is more compelling, Dirty D or the Shark
What luck
The title is wrong it came in to shallow because it had been hit by a propeller it’s a sitting duck in the deep ocean it knows it too so it came close to shore , humans always destroy everything
Humans are simply destroying everything. What sup with the vulgarity? If this guy had a higher IQ he would have a more interesting vocabulary. Get a high caliber gun and put a bullet in the head. Then pull him ashore and dress the carcass for food. This is not rocket science,  although for these clowns it may be.
Great video
Ecelente
is your friend ok? That looked quite painful lol
Poor creature..I feel bad for it. He&#39;s hurt
I would not have turned my back to it!!!!
God bless
Big GW! Wonderful footage! Thanks for sharing.
Sting rays and great whites in your front yard . Yikes
Awesome
Is the sharks name Holy Shit ? Or does he shit holy turds ? Or what ?
Por qué se asusta si el tiburón no come mierda había que ayudarlo a  volver al mar no estar solo sapeando sin hacer nada inutil
So sad! Why is this dude cussing so much. It’s not coming out of the water to have dinner at your house bro! Jeeeesh so dumb!
Don’t you think you guys so be out of the water since the shark is bleeding and other reef sharks will smell that blood
How many times are you going to say holy s*** loudmouth

Who the fuck is Dirty D and who cares?
El emocionado de la. Orilla, jalalo p&#39;acá
That&#39;s because all these fishing boats take all the fish.
Holy shit
I hope they called for help for this shark.
¡¡¡ Oh Sheet!!!...
Please with your language!
We had a 27&#39; Great White follow us on a Catamaran off Boca Raton FL in the 80&#39;s.  A  huge fishing boat saw it chasing us, &amp; went after it!  It swam so freaking fast!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏🥰🥰🥰🥰
Did anybody else notice this shark was in water ?
Yanks have very limited vocabulary skills
💔
He’s not mortally wounded  and he’s not dying . Who is this guy a shark doctor
San felipe??
I feel so sorry for these animals.They go through so much crap!!! Garbage, nets, hooks now propellers. Poor shark. He needs help.
His Spanish sucks!!!
Very good clip. It is a pity the commentator has such a limited vocabulary.
Call the authorities so that they can do something to fix that beautiful shark ya dum f**k.
Is bad that if I saw it I would touch the shark
E o babaca ali na beirada
Of all the dumbest things you could is run towards a Shark, the kindest thing you could do for is tow it in, at least it then wouldn’t become Food for other Skarks.
Once in a lifetime experience!  Amazing footage bud!  I was very pleased to learn that he/she was ok and doing what comes natural to recover fully 😊. Thanks so much for sharing this awesome experience. Cheers
Umm....., I&#39;d probably get out of the water!!
🙈 that mexican guy never stopping talking.. unbearable!!
the shark bleeds, huh?
What beach in Mexico was this in?
This guy is laconic, monosilabic and vociferous all at once.
That’s No Hammerhead Bro That’s a GREAT WHITE SHARK!
Did the Spanish guy want to eat it? Lol
Don&#39;t Call The Sharks 🦈 Freaking F Word, You Are The F Ones, Leave Them Alone, They Ate In Their House Their Habitat That Doesn&#39;t Belong TO YOU Ass 🧻!!!
Never swimming again
Dude all you have to do act like a live bait on a hook he&#39;ll swim right to you buddy and you can take pictures
Man scared of dying shark and he and the shark needs some attention
So tragic.
That was a packed video
Sharks are only able to breath when they move so he was about to die not hunting
and whys this idiot in the water?....
This is the stupid people die..wow
He sounds like a big corn ball
I don&#39;t speak Spanish but I&#39;m pretty sure that guy was yelling &quot;dude get the fuck away from that thing you fucking moron.&quot;
Big Shark!
It&#39;s not hunting stupid.  It&#39;s hurt
Wow
Что случилось,объясните?!!
Until it turns 180° and eats him in less than a second.
This is one of the most unusual and cool things I&#39;ve ever seen on YouTube. Wow.
Great footage......you really delivered

Que le pasó al míster, le hizo caso al mexicano y se acercó mucho
the shark was trying to catch stingrays in crystal clear water. he was just silting out the water to use like a smokescreen.

Hey dude, wanna be shark bait? stay in the water!
Wow somebody could get hurt  hey I just saw blood in the water was it hit?
I love that the guy said gnarly!!!👍
Yaralı bir dev
That guy getting stung in the foot by a sting ray, may be the best thing that&#39;s ever happened to him lol.. <br><br>Dude talking about, <i>&quot; grab it&#39;s back fin to pull it deeper into the water. &quot;</i><br>That could only have gone well, not like it could&#39;ve thrashed him around with its tail. Knocked him over or out,  an chewed his ass up like some of the fish and/or rays it may have been feeding on to survive. That thing knew what it was doing,  in <b>&quot;food will come to me&quot;</b> survival mode.
Some nerds would risk they life for likes on YouTube omg
I was hoping the shark bit his leg off ,what a moron
Omg you got so close!!
Friend &quot; I got stung real deep&quot; guy-&quot; yeah it&#39;s a sting ray, so anyways we got this great white shark right here&quot;🤣🤣🤣
Sharks in the Sea of Cortez?   Oooooh 🦈 yesssss!
im hit bro. sent me
Stupid guy in the background keep yelling grab him and bring him to shore
Why not leave him alone?
You guys should have killed that shark on the spot.
I guess people don’t know what is it that you actually do for a living, lol. You’re just a “stupid” person filming a white shark. Also only “stupid” people will turn their “backs” to a white shark in very shallow water that can’t get any closer to you, unless it really wants to get stuck, and die before high tide rolls in, lol. Awesome how many google experts tried to educated you on, instead of looking you up first, lol..
&quot;That thing has so much built up power in it right now, and it&#39;s dying.&quot;<br>I was entirely unaware that sharks are batteries in disguise. They must charge up via secret undersea pyramids. Then swim to the shallows to dock with the hidden retractable power cables. I think this man may have unintentionally gave away a big secret.
Imagine being out there having a swim and that great white rolled in😳
Hay acosadores hasta en océano! Te mereces un mordisquito!
All you did is to capture it on video...why you didnt call authorities or animal rescue to somehow give that poor shark needed 1st aid treatment from its injuries!! duh!?!
Only, only a white guy would venture so far out on the water while a Great White Shark is feeding...only a white guy would want to!!!!!
The main reason he stayed inland is because.....open wound will attract bigger sharks and kill it. They eat inland until scar heals and is not fleshy anymore.
All it takes is one quick turn for a video to turn into a memorial. <br><br>Very nice video nonetheless.
Leave it the shit alone!
Dude he will make!
Scary
Not a chance would I go in that sea.  I am terrified of fish and sharks no no no xx
Yeah but they didn&#39;t know it was wounded when they walked out there that wasn&#39;t to smart .
Your friend gets bitten/ stung &amp; YOURE CONTINUING TO VIDEO TAPE ?!?! 😲 🤔.... 🙄
What an expirence!!
His friend get stung by sting ray n he stays in the water with it n a great white man just for views it woulda bin funner er if the guy got eten
Nice house!
Where in Mexico?
Someone else using your video ! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/u85GxHZr1-A">https://youtube.com/shorts/u85GxHZr1-A?feature=share</a>
&quot;Holy fuck me runnin!!!&quot;<br>LMAO!
I feel so bad for that shark. Prayers.  God&#39;s creation too...
Holy shit what,sharks live in the water,get over it.
It looks about 12 feet
Yes he did, pal- it`s Couloussesm , a litle propellar dosent killed him ? you two are stupid..absoloutley! And he will not jump, he will lurk you out or come next summer you are dead man..
I don’t care what you say that is clickbait the Great white has been hit by a boats propeller and it has severed spinal cord and can’t switch and it close to death that’s why you said it was ok at the end with a blank screen with voiceover I think it disgusting just to get views
Dude not to smart please be careful 🙏
It isn’t hunting, great whites come up from underneath it’s prey. You should be getting help if this happens as great whites can’t stay stationary for long amounts of time. Also stay far away from the fish, as it could see you as a threat.
Very good movie (mean pictures) and idiotic, vulgar comment.
Doesn’t ANYONE read the creator’s msgs (above Comments Section, or ANYWHERE?) prior to asking questions or making “absolute” statements? Or even bother to watch (entire) video?? Ok. To save other comment readers (YOU! 😃) some major aggravation in reading future repetitive comments/statements/questions, let me try to nutshell the Top However Many questions which needed to be answered 7,498 times below. Here we go! …….  🌊 YES. The 🦈 lived. It was in the shallow water due to injury, temporarily hunting stingrays while it healed up (time, food, rest). Being in shallows served 2 purposes, health was the 1st, 2nd was safety. Being injured put the shark at risk of predation from others (sharks, orcas, dolphins..). There is MUCH argument about this below. A simple web search should clear up any confusion you may have as to whether or not dolphins are predators of great whites, for instance. Additionally, it is instinct that led the shark to do these things, like salmon swimming upstream to spawn, or newborn fawns to lay still &amp; silent for 27 hours. No “conscience decision making” needed. Don’t try to “think like a shark.” We absolutely cannot. And- stingrays do not “bite” (they don’t have teeth), it’s their barbed stinger at the end of their tail - which is attached to a venom gland - that you have to watch out for. (And y’all are worried about a statistically - comparatively, harmless, shark. 🫠 1,500-2,000 stingray injuries annually in U.S., compared to 47 shark attacks in 2021. Just sayin’.  ;)  Next- yes, many but not all sharks need to have water continuously moving through their gills to keep their bodies properly oxygenated. And great whites are one of them. Yet a shark’s body does not necessarily have to constantly be in motion to accomplish this. Turning into the tide, opening &amp; closing the mouth to push H2O through, &amp; using any rip tides/underwater currents, etc. will get the job done. Esp as you see here for short periods of time. Also a hot topic for some: “the thumbnail is a lie!” - “it’s clickbait!”… Well, clearly YOU did not watch the (entire?) video. Go to minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=222">3:42</a> 🐙.  🐟And related to this clickbait argument- the beautiful Carcharodon carcharias WAS indeed HUNTING. Stingrays. See above. Next up — THE SWEARING! The CUSSING! 🤭😱🤯 OHHH THE SKYYY IS FALLING!! Good heavens to Betsy, come ON, grown-up people. I’ve never actually seen such an over the top … responsible I guess you’d say?  ⚠️WARNING that there would be “The Devil’s Language” used herein. 👀  (lol 🙄) I mean - ya coulda just muted. ?? That’s it. End of story. But nooooo. Had to get all … JUDGE-Y. 😵‍💫  lol Big high five to Dirty D the Saxophone Player for going over &amp; above for Those With Their Heads Willfully Hidden In The Sand of the world. (Pppssttt .. your kids use those words at school. Just a lil’ secret from me … to you, Sunshine. 🥳)  So! As far as “why they didn’t get help” - the creator does a fantastic job of explaining that himself above in the Comment Section. (Mexico is NOT AT ALL like the U.S. Don’t try to compare them…. 🏖) Lastly, per the physical wounds &amp; everything having to do with the specific physiology of the shark - one of the top commenters is a veterinarian who dives into that aspect and covers it all in depth. Just scroll a bit (8 months ago) &amp; her post should be easy to find; she did a phenomenal job I think! 🦀 Remember to protect our seas! And if you want to be SHOCKED by how many great whites, &amp; other sharks are sharing YOUR beaches - grab my fav app, SHARK TRACKER by OCEARCH! (Last week for their “Meet a Shark Sweepstakes!” Win a trip/expedition/tag a shark/etc! 🦈) I’m not affiliated w/ them in any way- just a North East girl who LOVES sharks, the sea, &amp; FACTS! ;) And … 🐝 ooff coouurrsee, I GOTTA say it ….  Pearson Brothers Private Reserve Saccharo!!  🎉 Lol 😉 🫶🏻✌🏻🌎<br>(What’d I forget …. ?? 😛)
They are not hunting. It is either mating or birthing place certain times of the year. Pleaselet people protect this area
WOW
Es gracioso escuchar gritar a un ignorante; halalo halalo, halalo de la cola, pero el no se acerca a hacer lo que pide 😂😂😂😂😂, ignorante......no sabe el poder que tiene ese animal...............
HOLY SHIT ! 😂
Stupid MF out missing with it
Should have called this the holy F video LOL
Help the great fish you losers
I don&#39;t think anyone wonders if they&#39;re sharks in the Sea of Cortez in México. Years and Years of shark week has to taught us that.
I hope your friend that got hit by a stingray I can’t do nothing for the shark
You shouldn’t say bad words. It is not necessary
I wouldn&#39;t  be in the water  with a huge white  shark even if the shark is injured!
That&#39;s  scary  how close to shore they are!
Listening to the two guys &amp; their height of excitement &amp; fascination was equally as interesting as getting a close up of a Great White!! The guy filming in the water was simply blown away. While the guy on shore went on so hard I don&#39;t believe he ever took a breath.🤣🤣 sorry for all your troubles &amp; thank you for the Great White video 🦈💟🦈
I don’t see the shark mating or defecating so I don’t know where all the filthiness comes from. I never one time heard the F word growing up. Not once. And now it’s just everywhere it’s verbal pollution like a sewage.  STOP IT.
Gonna need a bigger ship
Leave the sharks in the water
Shit is not holy
Get out of the water U dope
Trash mouth. Shows extreme intelligence.
Which part of the Baja is this place?.<br>By the way 2 guys got hit by sting rays <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=122">2:02</a> 😂 one of those days
omg is that a shark?  ok lets get closer and look...... omg it&#39;s a great white shark, ok lets get even closer.... omg its moving, lets go right beside it
Why the !@#$ is he standing in the water get the !##$ out of the water dumb ass
&quot;thats not a hammerhead&quot; - 🤓
Thank you …thank you for making white people look stupid ..again when it comes to wildlife 🙄
The man behind screaming,  go away he can kill you!!! And he gets so close!
Could he be more annoying? Call the damn DNR - y’all ridiculous! Poor shark
Waooow mantaaap
First, that is not a great white. They have Grey bodies not black. They like any shark has to keep swimming or they will die. That&#39;s how they breath. These guys are not scientists
Yes, Injured Sharks are known to Swim into Shallow Waters to Heal or Recuperate until it Feels  Better &amp; Able to Protect itself Better from other Attacks…Then it Swims Back out to Deeper Waters‼️ 🦈…🐬🥰<br>Someone there tell Mr Negative to Chill Out &amp; Stop Dooming the Poor thing… They’re Pretty Strong &amp; Resilient so I wouldn’t get too Close.  It’s just Resting Up‼️😒😊
Better get the speargun just for out safety. Get the fuck out of the water if your worried about your safety jackass and leave the shark alone.
That&#39;s a bigg ass shark tho dayum?
So…you must have been holding that camera up really high or out wide to keep your balls out of the shot. Holy crap! Great camera work.
This White Shark wasn&#39;t hit. He was hit by a propeller. He came inshore to be safe.
It is dangerous of doing that cuz there can found another intact sharks trying to eat the wounded one.The shark cannibalism is well known and documented
Yea ...just keep walking right in the water ... Darwin&#39;s law !!!!
Holy sheet 😆 great video
Crap I&#39;m in Mexico now. Where in Mexico was this?
Раненая?
what was it cited for?
That&#39;s crazy... scary
This guy is like , &quot;Hey, let me go pet him like a puppy!&quot; 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great video Brother ,
Yeah you dumbass you can&#39;t call anyone for help so if it grabs you are you&#39;ll bleed to death. But it shows you&#39;re a complete Moran.
The poor shark!! 😢
Why are you still in water? Doesn&#39;t it&#39;s blood draw other sharks?
There&#39;s no such thing as holy s____,!
I love the guy yelling
Why walk out to it? Dumny
Зачем мне это попало на страницу?. Нерусь, перевода нет, не понятно ничего, что и как, что произошло с акулой наверно, кто мог её повредить?, куда она попала, кто нанес ей такую рану на спине и что там ещё  было, что парень повредил ногу, на что наступил?. Может и акула, на, что-то напоролась. Ваще, ничего не понятно. Нахрена тогда, этот чел это снял, себя пропиарил, что-ли?.
Good, I hope the shark dies.
Thanks for sharing. Amazing stuff!!
LOL you&#39;re wild. The shark looked directly at you, and turned to you while you&#39;re shaking with fear or excitement. You could have become its recovery meal in a heartbeat. The stingray hit too LOL. What a video.
This a hole has a very limited vocabulary
Its not hunting. He got hurt, probably by a propeller and its bleeding and when they get like this they go to shallow waters for 2 reasons: 1. Not to attract with their blood other dangerous predators. 2. The sun and the salt water will close their wounds and after the bleeding stops they will return to deeper waters. Its a defense mechanism that keeps them alive in dangerous. situations.
Tubarão branco não fica parado desse jeito, ele precisa estar em constante movimento para respirar !!!
So sad 😞 ppl need to be careful. Our sea life are dying. From turtles to coral fish etc
What the hell are two white dudes doing in the sea of Cortez. Other than stepping on stingrays. This is great entertainment
The guy is an idiot for being in the water near it.
Stingray hit !! Damn !  Fn ouch
What’s he wrapped up in the net ?
Kill it poor thing damn
I would’ve gone Republican on that monster
Way too much swearing.
I would of walked right up to that thing and smacked it in its teeth 🦈🦈
30 foot great white
I am an expert on tequila and I can 100% say the shark was not drunk
Hooman: the shark was injured and hunting sting ray since its unable to hunt anything else...<br><br>The shark: my favorite sting ray buffet place.....nom nom nom........
&quot;He&#39;s mortally wounded&quot;. The muffled &quot;Ay yai yai&quot; when the dude speaking Spanish got stung by the stingray. This has to be one of my favourite videos, I&#39;ve watched at least 25 times, lol
Pretty cool how it lures in its prey by pretending to be hit by propeller. <br>I can’t wait for part 2!
Its gonna eat your house holy shit!
What&#39;s with all the angry and nerds in the comment section? 🤣🤣
Any reason you guys have to use so much profanity?
Dinner 🍽️🥣
Why didnt u helped the poor shark
Wow
Sorry guys, that’s just my friend Paul… always getting stranded on beaches. I keep telling him Seagulls aren’t worth it!
Lmfao... I have an idea just let me sit in this pool of blood and film this dying shark....🤣
Cook it!
You are a dumb asshole.......is not feeding......is dying....ñ from a propeler to the back...... you asshole stupid
Leave it there to die. It wouldn&#39;t help you if you were hurt lol
Sharks are smart. Didn&#39;t think they could commit insurance fraud.
Я поняла что она ранена? А помочь никак нельзя??
Não ajudaram.o animal..
shhhh . . . don&#39;t tell the Orcas they&#39;ll kill it but only eat the liver.
the poor thing I feel so bad for it, and you can tell how much distress it is in.. heartbreaking
Bro! That shark was huge!!
My definition of “too close”, would anywhere that’s not on shore.
za
Fuck me runnin 😂😂😂  this whole shii was so freakin awesome!!
Shark looks fake
It would be nice if he stopped saying &#39;shit&#39; so much. Sir ... You live next to the ocean. The ocean has fish. Big and small. So yep, it&#39;s close to your house.
That&#39;s why they call them the great white sharks . Because they get so big.
Interesting video, but it was dangerous of him to get that close to the shark.
Is there no animal rescue where this is filmed?
It’s a great white shark 🦈 proceeds to go in front of it
I just wish the guy filming wouldn&#39;t have said &quot; f**kin white shark &quot; as every other words out of his mouth. He ruined the video.
Is the guy standing there showing off while walking towards it?
Working on a Darwin here.
He suffered an attack from an orca
Then they wonder how people die from shark
Like I said get out of the water stupid I told you when there&#39;s blood get out of the water and you&#39;re going to get bit and there&#39;s going to be something like I said that&#39;s going to come and they&#39;re going to want to eat that shark so if you don&#39;t get out of the water you&#39;re going to be food too if you&#39;re going to play in the water you need to know about what&#39;s in the water you need to know and learn things about the ocean and what&#39;s in it your friend just got bit and now there&#39;s going to be human blood in the water and that&#39;ll be even worse you better get out of the water before you become dinner
If he&#39;s bleeding out you should get out of the water because there will be others that will come for him and eat him
Well if he&#39;s been hit by a propeller he&#39;s probably going to die cuz I was trying to figure out why was he leaning one way so he&#39;ll probably die because he won&#39;t be able to swim right I had a fish one time in my aquarium that I didn&#39;t know that sharks attack angel fish I didn&#39;t know that I went and got my angel fish a little friend and it attacked my angel fish messed up its top 10 so he was leaning to the side so when their fins get out of whack they start leaning a certain way they can&#39;t get their balance in the water so he&#39;s going to die unless help comes along and they fixes them you know the national wildlife they can come in and get the shark if you were to call them and they could fix the shark poor shark I don&#39;t know why people can&#39;t leave these big fish alone
This shark is not hunting there&#39;s going to be a big earthquake it&#39;s going to come this shark knows something&#39;s wrong they can feel it in the Earth they know something&#39;s wrong you&#39;re going to be seeing a lot of sharks and a lot of this kind of stuff and then a huge earthquake is going to hit but I can&#39;t tell you where the earthquake will hit but it&#39;s going to be a good size one you&#39;re going to be seeing a lot of amazing crap going on it is awesome to see him out there like that but but it&#39;s not normal 💙💚
What I like to know why do people use the word holy shit so much what does it mean? Does that mean shit with a lot of holes in it? Oh I know what it means that’s when a Christian is taking a dump After eating chili fries with Swiss cheese
Why is everyone so surprised to see great white sharks in the ocean it&#39;s the ocean that&#39;s where they live
Классный карась
Where is this at so thay i dont swim there...
OMG HOLY 💩💩💩💩💩
The amount of people doing innocent things who get attacked by sharks and then there&#39;s this fucking moron who walks away unscathed, there is no justice in the world.
That&#39;s a very dangerous shark. It is wounded by a propeller.
I think I would have passed out
FFS, instead of wading up to it like a f* cking idiot, you should have called the coastguard to have them bring a marine specialist.  That shark was in distress and didn’t need your f* cking stupid dumb ass close to it.
The fact that they&#39;re just like&quot;that&#39;s narly!&quot; ????! Oh heck nah that will haunt me for the rest of my life
How do you know it got hit by a propeller?
Holy Moly weeks!
His friend was stuck by a sting ray and he just kept his cool 😂
Your Friend got hit. Someone pee on him.
This is why we need to start giving them space. He is dying that&#39;s why he is in the beach.
When animals like this come to shallow waters he is dying and in pain. This is where they come to die in the beach.
Someone please tell that guy in the background.......to SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!
Why run towards it 😆 🤣 😂
I would love to know why you weren&#39;t afraid that the shark wouldn&#39;t pull u out into deeper water please? I was terrified for you while watching 🤐
The only thing that eats sting rays is sharks
Huge? And hunting? Let&#39;s run out there.
Awesome video. Looked like a Thresher at first from the tail but once I saw his face and underside I agreed. Sharks are amazing creatures and I swear I won&#39;t kill em anymore. I have shark Karma, Many Makos and Threshers under my belt and on the Bar B.. Actually as an avid fisher(person) lol&lt;😆 . I started keeping Betta fish 8 months ago and just decided I don&#39;t want to kill them anymore..lobster and crab yes. Fish NO
New subscriber 🦈
A sad death..
I think he said &quot;holy shit&quot; 50 times or more. I had to turn off the sound
I believe the shark was just asking for you to come closer and play with it. Some sharks are like that they just want to play from time to time. He was hoping you could play a few bars of the John Williams Jaws theme.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=225">3:45</a> que quiere jalar? mamita que salamin
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=123">2:03</a> que le pasa al pelotudo de atras? se volvio loco
The Mexican local getting mad at the guy who is filming. 😂
Thku for this video it was really interesting
Pair of idiots....
Nice house, living the dream!
Well done x great the shark wasn&#39;t fatally injured. Great footage
&quot;something bit me&quot; said a morron 2 meters aways from seas greatest predator failing to realise the magnitude of his idiocity.
I&#39;m so sorry for the shark.  He is in excruciating pain and all because people are cruising the seas in boats irresponsibly 😪😥😔 You couldn&#39;t have helped him without hurting yourself.<br>He is beautifully tall ❤
Holy shit is right!
Il n a pas l air d être un requin blanc! Plus un requin tigre . Mais même il n est pas dangereux , il veut juste qu on l aide a s en sortir pour repartir au large. Y a t il d autre soigneurs animalier ici ???
I was hoping the shark would attack. Gladly the stingrays stepped in to save the day
Go out farther and see better
You said it was hit by a propeller and it is clearly dying, how about just shut up leave the scene and let it die in peace - think about how you would be feeling in his condition
Dude turning his back to a shark!  Lol good thing the shark was full
Pretty sure that shark did not make it
You&#39;ve got the best house position omg
Definitely a great white the poor thing doesn&#39;t like it&#39;s going to last much longer there
i don&#39;t think it was trying to feed on anything,,,it was trying to heal in the sun and warm shallow water...
Poor animal
I don&#39;t think anyone was wondering if there were great white sharks in the Sea of Cortez. How does someone live on the beach and not know what is in there? LOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=366">6:06</a> <br><br>That part is unintentionally hilarious, with that stupid sounding &quot;huuuoh!?&quot; when he gets bitten 😂<br><br>This video was great entertainment though, seriously. A rare sight to see Great White in this condition
People need to let nature do what nature does.. one thing injured or dead/dieing is something else&#39;s food. One thing I&#39;ve learned 30 plus years of nature shows and documentaries is your not to interfere... People need to let things be.
Shark is probably fine
Only thing that would have made this video better is if the shark had taken the guys leg off so we could hear the F-Bomb with more bewilderment! LOL Poor animal and hope it survived any more human cruelty as it was trying to heal!
Really dude? ….I mean come on Holy S<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23it">#it</a> so many times? Idiot!
The language in this video is terrible
So you can wrap a rope around its tail get a boat and drag it out into deeper water and I guarantee you it will swim off you&#39;re just letting perfectly healthy slightly injured great white drowned. a perfectly healthy great white it&#39;s not bleeding out there&#39;s no blood in the water that&#39;s not even that bad of a cut I&#39;ve seen much worse in sharks survive I mean they can get hit with some brutal brutal injuries and that seawater will just heal it up quicker than anything
He&#39;s not mortally wounded if he was mortally wounded he would not be able to move his tail back and forth like that he&#39;s just beached he&#39;s a massive shark that&#39;s obviously very shallow and he is huge think about you weighing 3,000 pounds being 18 ft long and trying to go through two two and a half feet of water
Well you got to start moving it somehow because white sharks cannot stop swimming or they&#39;ll die they have to have water constantly flowing through there gills. Such a magnificent looking creature I mean it&#39;s massive it looks like it&#39;s at least 18 ft long. Maybe a little bigger but it&#39;s beached itself and it&#39;s got a nasty little injury on his backside but I&#39;ve seen injuries like that on a white shark that are a whole lot worse fact is it just could be a very old shark.
Incredibly large shark thrasing around visibly in the water and this champs just walking right towards it, what a beast
Language
it isn&#39;t hunting it&#39;s dying from propeller strike
As someone who watches YouTube videos all day long. I can confirm this is a YouTube video
F**k me running <br>Lmfao
Humans destroy everything
Stay away from the shark. It still bites
That sea is hust nasty great whites attacking boats giant squid and sting rays attacking people never going to cortz I see so many dam horror stories from the sea of cortez
Almost thought it was giant trasher how high that tail was tell he looked out of the water that was my favorite part when he puts his head up like what am I hearing no one ruling up to help him like orca thought they need to keep moving
Soprised their isn&#39;t more videos of this same shark being seen next few day In shallow water
Read about a guy who was in a boat and his problem was damaged buy a propeller back some years ago shark did so much damage it sank I&#39;d bet this could be same shark when I heard of it I thought to stop a boat propeller shark must of Ben  hurt it ac y ugly sank the boat from the broke propeller coming threw to the inboard I&#39;ll bet this is the shark it&#39;s right in the area dumb ass shark
Isnt a jaws
I liked the video but I can’t stand the cursing.
Shark be like: Jesus shut the fuck up i want to rehearse here!
Just another video proving how dumb humans are
Lol Great Whites and Stingrays....sounds like a great vacation spot to me.
Dude started speaking perfect English after perfect Spanish,  gold lolll
This shark does not hunt in shallow water, but dies. The great white shark must move in order to breathe. When she stands still, she suffocates.
that shark will be fine, a sharks healing factor is pretty impressive
Dude, you should swim out and free it, it wont hurt you, it will be happy you freed it. Its ok hes just looking for food or mistaken identity.
Hear of  a guy who was sunk buy giant shark that attacked his prop in sea of Cortese  I&#39;ll bet this could be that Shark
Если бы акула напала после продолжительного времени ближения к неи - вы бы сказали-о черт? Такои бедныи лексикон?
The title states Great White Shark hunting when it clearly wasn&#39;t. It was wounded by a propeller as the annoying guy said.
Perfect opportunity to torture that thing. That shark&#39;s lucky!
Hahahhaha chale&#39;
Помогли акуле?
This video is so majestically chaotic lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=222">3:42</a>- Holy! That&#39;s some amazing footage of a Great White. That thing has to be at least 15-16 feet long and is a monster. It&#39;s probably fishing for sting rays. Beautiful animal, look at that caudal fin!
If that shark was bleeding out you’d be in a pool of blood, that’s a mere flesh wound
Go back it’s gonna eat u lol
Couldn&#39;t that shark swim towards him like suddenly?  Am I the only one thinking I wouldn&#39;t have my back towards him.
Why is he going near that big thing?
Mitgefühl ❤️ mit diesem großartigen Mitgeschöpf &amp; wichtigem Meeresbewohner🌈
Poor shark. I love ❤️ sharks!
Pretty sure it&#39;s not hunting in shallow water. Has a massive wound on it&#39;s back behind it&#39;s dorsal fin and went to shallow water to protect itself until it heals a little bit and can defend itself. Pretty weird how it sits in place for long periods, all of the experts say they have to continuously move to breath or will die.
I hate know it alls…and you Dale are a know it all! First of all you immediately assumed it was hit by a propeller. There are heaps of other explanations as to why it could have been deeply cut in the back. How do you know a Samurai wasn’t practicing on the beach earlier with his sword, noticed the shark and walked into the water and hacked at it a couple of times. Samurais are known to have a temper. Then you assumed that your friend stepped on a sting ray….maybe it was a part of that sword which broke off after hitting the shark. You see! Don’t be so quick to know all the answers. Thanks for the footage though.
You better let that shark out.
sad video
Be nice if you helped it to swim away
Dude ? What are we 15 years old ?
Lets stand 10 feet from a shark and complain from a stingray bite but not worry about that shark  turning around and biting your ass off
I’d have a stroke seeing this in the water
WHY ARE UOU JUST STANDING THERE WHY DIDNT THOSE IDIOTS CUT THE NET I HATE PEOPLE!!!!!
Holy fuck me running <br><br><br><b>appropriate reaction</b>
It&#39;s like a submarine
That’s when me and my friends come teach it a lesson😤
you  tell that dude to go stand next to it ,, the next you know he is faking a stingray bite ..  you didn&#39;t get bit  by no stingray you little girl , guy is running from a shark.. thats hot sauce on him at the end there.. ..  you want to make areal YouTube vid put a rope on the neck of that thing and ride it back Ito shore..  Stingray hat sauce and all...
see one that size u still wanna play in the water win more shit smaller in size get ur balls bring him back with sent of blood
Thanks for the video … one of the best videos I’ve seen on YouTube … hope he really survived… thanks 🙏 you got the balls to go in there and shoot this footage ✌🏽
How far was this from sandy beach in rocky point?
I’m gonna draw em in to the shallow.  I’m gonna draw em im and drown em.  “Quint”
You wouldn’t see a killer whale behave like that. The great white is saying “everyone feel sorry for me I’m bleeding out” hey the Killer Whale would be like “hey mother fucker you want a piece of me” yeah exactly don’t fuck with the Killer Whale.
These animals are so smart and way more docile than I imagined... Thanks Jaws
Sting Rays,...Sharks.. shoot the Sea of Cortez don&#39;t play.
I watched an Orca take a bite out of a Great White and the poor thing just bleed and sunk like a stone..
Dude the water is full of blood......Get Out Son...
This commentary sucks
The dude telling you to pull the shark by the tail to the shore is an idiot lol. Can&#39;t believe he got mad at you for telling him it has tons of power to pull you lol.
Holy Crap that is an awesome video. Hopefully it lands on Shark Week
How funny and ironic his friend got stung during all that 😂😂
Bro if the shark is facing you don’t stand there and not move 😂
Hey bud you don’t belong here
I don&#39;t wanna get to close though.&#39; <br>There were go. 8cm should do it.
That guy in the background yelling at you to pull it closer was getting on my damn nerves. I legit wanted to beat the hell out of him since he was acting stupid and not comprehending what you were telling him 🫠
🥺😔
Why....why....is everyone walking so close to this shark?
Stingray , great whites and you are on foot so long . You must be out of your mind dude
Chaleee
why would anyone walk into the water with a shark, get closer to a TERRIORIAL apex predator, and then TURN YOUR BACK to it??? in the time it takes to turn around and say &#39;huge shark&#39; is enough time to turn back around to shark suplex back into the water and torn to pieces, and then the camera man, but at least we would&#39;ve gotten a shark attack pov
The Dude in the Background in Spanish knows better
It is a white. So sad because their numbers are dwindling… Fucking boats
Poor shark. 😢
&quot;its been hit by a boat propellar...its very sick&quot;...This guy Pretending he knows exactly what happened and Exactly how the Shark feels
Ребята, конечно видео  очень  интересное..! Но не стоит так рисковать своей жизнью и здоровьем...
Qué tal el otro, dizque &quot; jalelo&quot; en vez de dejarlo en paz. 😠
Hmm sharks attack in shallow water . Yeah let&#39;s go take a closer look 🤪
Excellent video, dude, 🙂 ...
Love how buddy just keeps filming a shark instead of acting to help his friend.... &quot; Yo go out your foot in hot water&quot;... I&#39;m gunna just hang out here and film....  I&#39;m not going in the water with you around LMAO
Beautiful creature.   In a lot of pain.   Tryin to rest and heal ...
Whoever’s walking up to the shark is a dumb ass and I hope they get bit 😂🤷‍♂️ karma will come…It’s called a great white lol not a white shark
I would never, walk up to a whiteshark. And I would never ever, turn my back against it. Even if the shark is hurt, they can attack if they feel threatened.
It would be easy to catch this beast, tow it to the shore, and make steaks of it!
Best video
5 years later 40 million views. Hope this is monetized.
That’s not a bear are you kidding me?’
So interesting.  I&#39;m happy it lived. I think! ;)<br>I&#39;m so sorry about your friend getting stung.  Didn&#39;t look so fun. Thx for sharing.  What a beautiful area.
Está pidiendo ayuda ?, Hermoso tiburón 😍, que herida tan profunda.<br>Quisiera saber cómo terminaron las heridas inclusive la del compañero, lo hirió otro pez ?.
Please show more great white sharks
Lol<br>At The Beginning  of The Video (Minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=88">1:28</a>) There Is Someone Shouting In Spanish &quot;Grab Him,  Pull Him From The Tail Friend, Pull Him, Pull Him Overhere (What An Idiot). With The Power This Shark Has Anyone Pulling His Tail Would Have Been Seriously Hurt Or Ended up  As Shark Dinner! Lol
Sure,  GW sharks may be terrifying to look at, but there’s no species on earth more terrifying than us humans. We’re the ones harassing, hurting and killing these majestic, protected sharks, intentionally or not. I really hope that shaker recovered.
SHIT BLA BLA BLA SHIT BLA BLA BLA SHIT 🎶
He says I don&#39;t wanna get close too it when he already close to it😑
Sad
We all know the cameraman never dies!!!!
That&#39;s me walking into the water... I actually went swimming. Guy walking by says you know there&#39;s sharks, right!? I said yes!
Dude wants him to pull it by the tail and bring it to him , then gets stung by a stinggray 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
People like him are the ones that get killed and come out in the news next day while I&#39;m eating dinner..... idiots.
Your Grammar is offenfing the Shark🦈🦈
Since I know Spanish good enough, I defintely knew what these guys are saying lol. Poor shark was bleeding and hurting. Sharks are damn resilient, but you could see it could barely stabilize at times... they say when they are sick or hurt...sharks will move to the shore line for safety and easy food source...So that makes sense it was there. Glad it probably made it. I&#39;ve seen some videos of some really beat up sharks swimming like nothing happened. Freaking beautiful and terrifying animals at the same time. Also, that is why you gotta do the sting ray shuffle!
А что там случилось у них?
Poor shark
I’d be concerned the blood is attracting more …
Ride it. And you shall be the Mah Deeb
Перевод
“Poor guy “ ☹️☹️☹️☹️ sad sad sad
Акула выжила?
Should have called a marine biologist 👩‍🔬 or George Costanza 👴
what was amusing about this, was the one intrepid guy standing very close to the deadly voracious predator White shark.  Then the other guy summons the courage to come out, gets stung by a harmless sting ray and high-tails it back to shore whining about his horrible wound.  LOL
If it had spun around he may have been lunch 😬<br>Very lucky... But what a thing to witness close up 😲
Is it not to prevent drowning that they swim to shallow water if they are wounded 🤔
надо было брать его за хвост и тащить на шашлык, а он стоит болтает))
Poor Shark
Hunting or hurting? This shark is in pain dieing
Call the ocean conservancy or police and try to do something you ignorant fool!!
Holy fuck me running!!🤣😅poor shark .so sad
But why this guy going near when he can watch everything from a safe distance
&quot;Hold my beer&quot; moment
Hey,  where can we get a bottle of Pearson brothers private reserve not wine wine? And do you have a commemorative Great White Wine?
This is just sad.
Good Lord!!!.......all you can hear is a couple of fast and never stop.....talking Latinos!! How annoying!
“Let’s see how close we can get with being eaten”
The side story with the stingray is also great.
Kids<br>I&#39;ll tell you what<br>I&#39;ll beach myself<br>Flop around crazy<br>When the dumb ass come out to see me up closer<br>Make a hard run and get them for diner....<br>😊😊😊🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
Looks injured
He&#39;s lucky he was the cameraman
Why are you getting so close when you are afraid?
That&#39;s a lot of blood.......
Que imbecis! Chamaram ajuda pra tirar o bicho de lá? Não né, só ficaram filmando o pobrezinho agonizando
Don’t fall for the trick! That’s how the shark on Deep Blue was getting people!
Bro what you do for a living lol
man! I know that stingray hurt!! been there and it&#39;s literally Hell on earth.
What a dummy to get so close.  I don’t care the animal, fish, whatever, when they’re injured they’re more dangerous.
What?? THATS FREE FOOD RIGHT THERE!!! OH MAN!!!!Man i would kill and it eat it🥰Sharks are soo yummy to eat
As deadly as these creatures  are, feel badly for this shark , a slow death at the hands of man. Probably on purpose!!!
Please quit cussing i can even share your with children.
It was a good video minus hearing your very Foul language-that was extremely annoying
Holy sh*t what a Dumb ass. He may be injured but still strong enough to bite and injure you. I don&#39;t understand why you have to show your bravado it&#39;s stupid.
Вопрос только, как она дышит? Ведь у акул нет жабер, они могут дышать только когда двигаются!
That stingray hit came outta nowhere , what a great video.
40M views in 5 years and the video got to me today 7/27/2022 Amazing!!!!
Oh ya,hook up a rope to his tail and bring him in dude. Great idea.NOT
Dumbasses! Blood is going to bring other fish to feed!
The moron who told him to rope the tail should be thrown in at the maw
Attenzione! Povero squalo, è ferito! Mi dispiace x lui! Si potrebbe cercare di aiutarlo!!
It is actually getting natures sterilizer the suns UV on it&#39;s wound. The wound looked more like a rope injury from a fishing boat. It can feed in the shallows for a while.
Poor thing.
Oh well thank you Mother Earth, out the water and on my plate😋
Thats a fucking white shark bro
H o L Y S H I T 🤣
This dude is massive and so fckng powerful! Thanks for sharing this video🙏
That&#39;s a big boy too
Waw not a clickbate image! This is a great video, you got close up and weren&#39;t shaking the camera or all over the place throughout. Also thanks for the update at the end there, as soon as the video went black I was like noooo what happen next?
Been hit by something blood in water
dirty shit ou should be in jail
So glad that shark was seen on different days, hopefully it’s fully healed and back into the dead waters 🦈
THANX FOR THE VIDEO CHAMP👍🏼 COOL VIDEO TO SEE A GREAT THAT CLOSE &amp; THAT BIG . HOPE THE FELLA SURVIVED UNLESS THE SEA LIONS GOT HIM BACK🤣😂😅
Dumb dumb. <br>That&#39;s how people die dumbest
i come back to this video once a year its so cool
Him: that’s a big shark<br>Shark:Yes im big and why don’t you come and play and see how friendly I am 🙄😂
I have seen white sharks hunt seal in on the beach so I wouldn&#39;t get to close
That&#39;s why you gotta shuffle your feet when in saltwater instead of lifting your feet to walk its better to kick one than step on it
Dale Pearson is an absolute CHIEF. Fuck man what a legend.
San Felipe Baja?
It&#39;s not snowflake pet detective jim carrey
shallow or not, you are pretty ballzy getting that close man!
Well, looks like it&#39;s a youngen, but it would still freak me out to know it&#39;s so close to my home. Crazy...
THATS YOUR HOUSE!?!? IM ON THE WAY
Yo that sting Ray will kill you. Old Dale too busy filming a dying shark
why isnt/hasnt anyone helped the poor beautiful Fish..? cruel just filming saing &quot;Holy Shit, its dieing...HELP THE POOR FISH...
Ну кто нибудь по русски может написать что там произошло ? Почему  нет перевода ?
Wow you got sooooo close hahaha
Maybe call Dept. Of Fish and Wildlife or Office of Marine Conservation??
How does the Word Holy get into your vocabulary like that?
Heard him say holy shit like 70 times lol bye sharks weakness is land
Love Dale Pearson , he is a great shark diver, love the Sea of Cortez as well!
They can go into shallow waters! <br>Love Hammerheads too!
And the idiot is out in the water with it 🙄
How long it would take for a wound such as that to heal more or less?.
Supposedly there’s a megalodon in the sea of cortez
Что с ней?  На русский переведите.
Amazed he didn&#39;t have a feed on the guy filming, that are unpredictable and fast.
Did you see the hammer?. That comment can be misunderstood!
Why are you in the water dude wtf
Looking for food.
Only the MEG could have bit this Charlie shark! 😳
Think its a black shark
Well he got 40 mil views
It&#39;s a white  shark for sure..... let me get closer
I guess these guys never watched Jaws specifically where Chief Brody says to Ellen &quot;did you know most shark attacks happen in 3 feet of water 100 feet off shore?&quot;
He should have called some marine biologists to help it.
Holy shit is all he can say: lol 😂
yea let me walk a lil closer just to be safe
This man&#39;s got balls of titanium...fuck it...he walk like 5 feet next to an injured apex predator.<br><br>His balls are made of admantium
What happened to your friend&#39;s man that day...may I get an answer sir
Get up there close to him and give him a pet on his snout
Orca did it again
Leave the fcking shark alone
Too close for comfort?
Aw I kinda feel bad for it it’s probably in so much pain 🥺
That thing was big as hell
That is really cool.
Que venga la poli
That’s heartbreaking poor shark, hope the string ray injuries healed
Might as well poke it with a stick
Jaws ain&#39;t going out like that
Holy $%*+ F me running!! I&#39;ve been hit!! Had me Rollin 😆
⛑️
“I don’t want to get too close” 👀 sirr
Cool video man...
Lol dude got stung lol that is funny
Oh man that sucks I knew something was wrong
What the heck man is it sick
Where in Sea of Cortez?
Good video
This guy swears like a sailor, lol!  All he can say is holy $hit!
Fuck  me running. Lmao sounds like something I would say
Ummmm why are you that close?
Poor Shark!
What a idiot! lol why dont you go kiss it!
&#39;hit by a propellor&#39; :(
Its an huge Black shark.
God people are so fucking annoying. Just leave it the fuck alone.
That Pup&#39;s a goner. Too bad you couldn&#39;t have tied it by the tail , pulled it up on the beach, let it expire and cut it up into steaks.  Then proceed to sell it to all of the restaurants as far and wide as possible. Shark is best eaten when super fresh. Followed by putting the remains in plastic tubs and motoring them out for his buddies to feast on what&#39;s left.  It&#39;s either that or put up with a stench for a month from rotting flesh. Brought to you by a past fish monger. Hey, ocean rules!
Of course there are Great Whites in cortez island. Is full of great whites.
I am the only person I&#39;ve ever heard say &quot;holy fuck me running.&quot; Kind of a very specific turn of phrase; never figured I&#39;d hear anyone else say it. Crazy crazy crazy
This dude is 99 kinds of crazy!!!
this guy is a moron! this a LARGE GREAT WHITE he will be more then likely fine and cruising the ocean now. these are resilient creatures and survive much worse. check out Malibu artist Ca drone footage unfortunately GW sharks are struck with boat propellers often
Poverino non mi piace vedere soffrire soprattutto madre natura per colpa nostra perché quella è roba nostra😤😤😤🤔🤔🤔
That shark looks more like a submarine 😳
Filthy mouth
Bro the sting ray incident was crazy
he looks old; and injured. poor fish. they will fish in shallow land; but he is in because he is so hurt... there are great whites all up and down the pacific coast; one of their favorite waters.
Holy Shit White Shark...I tried to Google the description if such kind of sharks exists, but couldn&#39;t find one.
Nice language!
Great white in shallow water<br><br>Dumb ass human: “I don’t wanna get too close” <b>while standing about 2ft away</b>
evry body in this video talking  amd worrie about life shark but not one care about what happen to the other friend bite   whit   a stingray so the humanity level here is cero  people care more about a predator animal more tham a human life
Don&#39;t be surprised if other sharks come and start tormenting him. Obviously u don&#39;t realize that shark as hurt as he is can beach itself. Call an ambulance for the stingray sting. U can get very sick from the sting.
Why are you in the water with it?  I would be afraid of being bitten.  It might be hungry.  Call in the shark professionals instead!  They would know what to do.
That Mexican guy was yelling for him to grab the shark by the tail and for him to drag the shark to shore, but we never seen the Mexican guy get close or hear him close. He&#39;s known as the long distance tough guy
Brahh get out! You’re about to be shark chum!
I feel sorry for Beasts like this shark, human stupidity dumping fishing nets makes this shark &#39;prehistoric die sad, shame on humans
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=221">3:41</a> wowww
The guy telling him to pull his tail in Spanish 😭😂
I agree it was feeding on stingrays... that shark in its condition is a huge danger to anyone who might be swimming in that area. a human in the water would be the easiest thing possible for it to catch if they were swimming in deeper water and couldn&#39;t see it coming.
&quot;That&#39;s a sting ray&quot; 😂😂 that was gnarly
Holy shit I thought the thumbnail was fake but oml
poor fuckin animal
Good video bro
These guys clearly don&#39;t know what their talking about.
I cannot stop laughing. His friend is over there dying from a sting ray yelling “I got hit!!“ and he’s all “cool put in it hot water. You’re bothering me and this shark.“ 😂
&quot;chale&quot; xD
He&#39;s trying to perch himself. The injury hurts more when he using his body to swim
Este hombre abla el español bien chin gon 👍 👍 👍
Thanks dirty d
isn&#39;t that the diver from MonsterQuest  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=413">6:53</a>
Is this in los Cabos, la Paz or in San Jose?
Mortaly wounded..  We have an expert  here😄
What part of Mexico is this??
Bro hop on his back and ride out to sea!  🌊
I know it’s amazing to see it, but you can’t get out of it’s way if it comes for you. But wow a once in a life time. Amazing
This guy is bucking for a cameo appearance on Hal’s “What were ya thinking?”
That shark needs to keep moving to stay alive that little cut will not kill that shark.
The funniest part for me,<br>First dude: Look, here comes the guys.<br>The Guys: Hit the water running, charge the shark.
The idiot who was filming the video kept ignoring the guy speaking in Spanish and still he was stupid enough to stand next to him and stay in the water for a long time.
This man is crazy lol
👤 Bullshark.!!!<br>      ...🦬💩💨...🦈...
Definition of an ass.
That&#39;s the biggest bottle nosed dolphin I&#39;ve ever seen
He said “f$@k me runnin” 🤣
Thank you meth heads jumping in the water
1) 💩 is not Holy.   2) Clean up your filthy mouth!
Standing right next to it &quot;I dont wanna get too close though&quot;
Don&#39;t get to close😳 I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t mind a lil last meal!
It could of been shot at? That must of been a big boat!
Looking at that gash on the shark, I know I can&#39;t be a doctor or vet.
There was so much noping in this video I lost count. Thanks for sticking around and letting us see that beautiful creature when everyone else would have noped out of there.
Bro either jump on its back or stay out of the water
Oh my god, I actually screamed when its head comes up... What is wrong with this man?!
It came to shore to find a nurse shark. 🤣
Shark pretends to be injured. It has learned over the past few years on how to fish for land based morons. And it starts leading its prey out into deeper water.<br>You could very easily have been a &quot;What were you thinking?&quot; Portion of Sharks Happen and hals show.
Hi Hal. Starting  at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=135">2:15</a> I smell “Darwin Award!! 🥇 or at least  he could appear as a guest on the hit  YouTube show….“What were you thinking” 🤣
The shark was clipped by a prop and swam to warm waters to allow itself time to heal the wound from the sun.
So let me get this straight.  It was a white shark?  And it was hit by a propellor?  Well - fuck me running<br><br>EDIT:  Hal sent me
Damn that is kinda big
Where was this?
My best friend, that&#39;s a great video. I will always cheer for you in Korea I&#39;m looking forward to a great video. Have a nice day.
Dude the Mexican guy telling you to get the hell away so funny 😆 he was at hunting though he got hit by boat
The shark was that close to you all to ask you guys for help!! Animals have the instinct when brutally injured to naturally swim to people to seek help
Yep…sharks live in the ocean and they eat people! 🦈🦈🦈
That Thing ain&#39;t going to make it, Best thing is drag it to shore, cut it&#39;s Jaws out while it&#39;s still alive, dip him in Tempura batter and deep fry the sucker
Needs saved
Dude are you really plugging all your products in the comment section like fn spambot?<br>Great video but im turning off this channel for sure.
I&#39;m not a vet,but i did have a cat that liked to bite when hungry named Jaws, and i can say with some degree of certainty that we are looking at a Great White shark.

So fuck going swimming there not really because of the shark but because the two guys I saw get in the water got stung by stingrays. They do not play about their cove I guess 😂
The guy got stung by a stingray and bleeds feet from a great white . Yea I would leave that water immediately
Poor thing getting salt water in that wound. Let him be
😬🤣 I’ve been hit!!! 🤣🤣🤣😂
Son muy buenos para dar consejos pero ellos no se meten a jalarlo
As if a 14 - 16 foot great white shark with a huge spinal wound in 2 - 2.5 foot water right by the shore wasn&#39;t enough, your mate had to also get stung by a stingray.<br>You were so captivated and in shock and awe of the great white that you acted as if your buddy had got bitten by a mosquito when he got his foot barbed.<br>What an absolutely fucking bonkers scene this was, lol!
Chill with the offensive to God language.
“Yep yep thats a stingray hit you need to get out immediately” and continues to stand right next to where it was 😭😂 Everything about this video is awesome
my man get out of the water !!!
Video was great but you foul language was bothersome.
Love the conclusions and info at the end, I saw the wound in the back of the dorsal fin during the video, it makes sense now!
I would literally be forced to touch it&#39;s tail lol
man the guys in this video clearly knew nothing about sharks… hopefully they left it be because he was definitely not dying
The most annoying voice in existence.
Another.     Example.<br>Puerto.   Rico..<br>Drug.    Alcohol.         Addiction.
That&#39;s all I gotta see...now I&#39;m NEVER going near a beach! 🦈
They crazy and not scared he is crazy
What great Assholes you are!!!
Dayumn Dirty D, the real mystery is why do I watch this EVERY TIME it comes up on my feed. Literally once a month for the past few years! <br><br>I ordered some of you and your bros amazing product btw! Now I just need to come hang in paradise with you guys! “Ufckin A it’s A White Ufckin Shark!”
Dat shark &gt;.&gt;
Good thing iam on my toilet I would&#39;ve shit myself
Hey buddy, you are already too close.
Who else wanted to see this douche get bit?
Hi
A couple of morons
Enough of the Holy Shit comments already!!!
Get out of the WATER!!!
Damn tough fish to survive an injury like that.
if your not going to call a professional to go help it then leave it be the poor thing would have been in pain and annoyed never mind you following it everywhere and winding it up more some proper idiots out here honestly and people wander why they get attacked by sharks 🤣🤣
Bit risky getting close to something that could bite your leg off faster than you could shout ouch!
Well done capturing, documenting and providing a closing statement.  Thank you
Ah. This is when Dirty D went to Mexico!
The guy talks like Dale Gribble
Stop saying f word
Alternative title:  A shark suffers an unfortunate injury and is surrounded by a handful of semi-retarded bros.
I&#39;ve got a suggestion Mr bonehead.your walking up on a great white shark with lots of blood in the water which attracts more of them....please get out of the water so it&#39;s not your blood out there.
These dudes need some black friends to tell them that’s not a good idea. “I’m hit dude” Ctfu what are we in Iraq? 💀💀💀💀
I was rooting for the shark to get one last good meal in.
Why did they not put some bullets do that motherfucking kill them to make sure you don’t kill any kids
Call authorities
Get your title right.  He&#39;s not hunting; he&#39;s injured and dying.
Where is he going.. i am confused 😕
Such an amazing thing to see yet ruined by your disgusting and completely unnecessary language
I think he was asking you for help
holy shit i hear a dope
Ahhh? Dirty D, mucho abla... Eto mucho, mucho, wabbos!
I burst out laughing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=385">6:25</a>, him informing his friend on what to do about a stingray attack WHILST TURNING HIS BACK TO A GIANT FREAKING SHARK. The way it pans back lol
i do not know what it&#39;s more impressive , the bravery of this man getting so close to can film this magnificent beast or the guy&#39;s stupidity saying: pull it out there ( Jalalo pa ca)🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ che vato pendejo
Shame he didn&#39;t bring his saxophone... could of played &quot;Mack The Knife&quot; by Bobby Darin
Crazy dude...Holy shit for every coment on that poor white shark.🤣🤣🤣👌
amongst all the postulating it&#39;s sad that none of the authorities were called . in the UK the beach would have been full of helpers within minutes as seen when we sadly get whales <br> and other large sea creatures beached
Translation:<br><br>“What the fuck are you idiots doing?”<br>“Looking at this injured shark”<br>“Are you fucking stupid?”<br>“Yes”<br>“You left your wallet on the beach. What is the PIN number for your bank card?”<br>“Why do you want to know?”<br>“Just curious. You should get closer and see if it is not just a dolphin. He might need first aid”<br>“Ok. It is 4135”<br>“Thanks. Where are you going and why did you throw that food in the water?”<br>“In case you get hungry”<br>“Cheers”.
&quot;Throw a rope around its tail and pull it in&quot;....people are so fkg ARROGANT! ....&quot;hes mortally wounded&quot; so this guys a shark expert now
Wow.  Wow.  Incredible
In the words of Jeff Foxworthy, &quot;Here&#39;s your sign.&quot;
A massive great white in front of him and the dude gets stung by a sting ray😆
Imagine moving up on a great white .<br>Shouting be careful take precautions?<br>Only to be taken out my a 1 foot long ray ! 😂😂😂
Dale. What class are you playing ? Do you have a mezz spell ?
keep going. It needs food brought to it
warn me ahead of time No.English
Very sad fate for the monarch of the ocean. 😢
Shut up you dope,Jesus,enough swearing
It honestly looks like he came up for help. He believes coming to shore, someone might try to help.
Go out in the water stupid.
Your fuckin too close ,  CRAZY  !!!
That guy though🤣🤣🤣🤣that is about the whitest thing EVER!!!
He said chale!! 😆 🤣 😂
Looks like a Plane...What an absolute BEAST...Probably is in shallow water so it can try to heal and to make sure it is not Food for other creatures in the Ocean
This guy is acting like he just saw flight 11 crash into the Tower
Stingrays and white sharks who knew
Dude getting hit by the sting ray... 😂
Now you just need to go digging for a fossilised sharks tooth and your life is complete. <br>Magnificent capture and truly the best shark video I&#39;ve ever seen thanks 🙌
The guy who got hit by a stingray may have just saved his own ass, by not walking up to the giant shark...
Just think of the other way round: stuck in shallow water with a huge gash on my back, barely able to move a finger, and all of a sudden a great white shark wearing a Pearson Brothers cap comes at me and starts to videotape my distress with his smartphone instead of giving me a fin...<br>No doubt I&#39;d be angry as fuck !
At least  they got one of them  pieti  judging e    how do u know  people age so ifiodds  u dont oan the earth u ard part of this shut if I could  I would   put u in  your correct place in the back of my n y c  dept  if sanitation  garbage truck leave it alone  unless   u leT  yo share  and have greater compassion for the giant  toilet   u age the turfs of the  titey bowel go watch the sleezy supper  dish  on Sunday night and watch the cmrrcials and half time   talentless rip off do  disapointong

He will make it if mr foul mouth leaves him alone in the shallow water. The salt water helps wounds heal. They used to dunk burned sailors off the sides of ships. The shark is staying away from other predators in the shallow, in an attempt to save his own life.
I’m sorry but I can’t stop laughing my ass off at this video! 🤣🤣 There is just so much going on, it’s like a full episode and i need popcorn! It’s so intense and then the friend who said “I’m hit Bro” i can’t 😂😂
Wtf are you doing? Get the hell out of the water homie.
Looks like a basking shark, still not good too be around injured fish or animals nature takes over be careful out there.
I feel so bad for this shark :( 😞
Stupid humans and their propellers.
That’s crazy. While witnessing something that most ppl don’t see on a daily basis he was punished by Gods wrath for filming it on YouTube by sending a stingray to whack him with its tail.  Lol
Lol when he said “holy fuck, me running.   Haha
I don&#39;t want to get to close. 3 foots 👍
Is that Andy Richter holding the camera?
Most people run or swim away… these hero’s run towards to offer any help…
The guy in the water knows that it&#39;s a great white shark, has diagnosed its medical history, tells the dude after the stingray hit to get in and get the hot water going on his foot immediately. How about go back in and and have a Burger dude?
Where in Baja was this?
Omg! How utterly amazing! What a wonderful experience you got that day, and I&#39;m so grateful you were brave enough to film it and share with all of us. I really appreciate the comments from the vet and other experts, nice to know that sharky macsharky was going to survive. Really cool video and thanks again, but seriously, maybe not so close next time I was really tense watching you! 💖👍
Oh Boy !!!! Nice great white!!!!
Holy fuck me runnin haha beautiful but deadly animal
when that thing turned around i thought u were the one that wasn’t going to make it
&quot;That might be a White Shark&quot;....&quot;That&#39;s a HUUUUGGEEE White shark. Hey let&#39;s walk into the water and go towards it&quot;....Total &quot;hold my beer&quot; moment smh.
Sun might felt good on the sharks wound 🤯
When the Shark turned around Not in the net I would of Been on my way back OUT of the water asap injured or not
What a pair of idiots....
They be in the shallow water with a great white shark, stingrays and stuff, where the hell is that 😆
What a majestic animal and the chance of seeing one like this in shallow water must be close to 0
He wants to become a 5 course Dinner for a Shark what a dope. He&#39;s totally Goofy
Stingrays can kill
There is alway&#39;s a reason it comes to shore but look for it&#39;s young also.
More scared of the stingray at this point. Poor shark. :&#39;( bleeding out. They should put him out of his misery. 🦈
Im an expert at identifying propeller wounded predatory large fish in shallow tropical water, and I can confirm that thing is definitely in water
Always remember we must repent of our sins (sin is transgression The Law Of Yahuah The Father in Heaven. The Law are The Books: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, &amp; Deuteronomy). We must repent of our sins and Have Belief On Yahusha The Messiah. HE Died and Rose three days later so that we can be forgiven of our sins! <br><br>Come to HIM🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
Huggggee white shark meanwhilw his dumbass keeps getting closer not knowing this shark can swim in burst of 50-60 miles per hour
Why go in the water?
Idk man looks more like a shark is dying in shallow water not really hunting
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna get to close&quot;....while standing like 3 feet away from a 14 foot shark lol
I&#39;m loving our hispanic friend shouting in the back lol. <br>That is crazy tho. What an experience. Poor shark.
Thanks CaptainWafflez for your input.  My first thought was that Dale Pearson might be wrong; it takes more than two propeller wounds (even as deep as one of them was) to kill the oceans&#39; most perfectly designed fish/ predator.  I also do not believe that a Great White can &quot;bleed out&quot;.  Interesting that he or she returns to what they learned as a juvenile regarding how to survive, i.e. go to the shallows and pursue a diet of sting rays until they feel better and have healed from those horrible propeller wound(s).  Great video D. Pearson.  That took some large ones to get that close to that 12-15 footer, injured or not.
It&#39;s annoying how much you needed to curse and &quot;holy shit&quot; every other word. 🙄
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   :0  :0  :)
What beach was that
Nice language !
Jheeeez someone tell speedy gonzales at the beach to shut the fuck up 🙄
what an idiot, so lucky he didnt get chomped
Get some help stop staring at the poor thing. Omg is like prayers do something
&quot;Holy Shit&quot;  Dude.
bro so much going on dude got hit by stingray in the meantime lol
He said I don&#39;t wanna get close as he closing in already🤣🤣<br><br>But the HOLY FUCK ME 🏃‍♂️ 🤣🤣
Why the clickbait title??
It looks injured!!!!
The language is not something I want my grandchildren to hear so they had no volume from a shark expert no less
Awesome what happens in your own back yard .
NAH RAIDER....IT WAS A FUCKING MINOW!! DUH
Holy shit, is that all u can say
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=231">3:51</a> “Holy fuck me running” now that’s a new phrase I never heard before
Thank you for the video. Amazing experience.
I would’ve shit myself so fucking hard when that thing turned to face you like that…you got some balls homie lmao
what happened to the guy that was attacked by the stingray
&quot;Get closer. For perspective&quot; lmao
Way too far from shore and way too close to that thing...
The guy said in this video I don’t wanna get to close your right next to it buddy
What happened to your buddy ?
Did it live ??
Hate to see how excited this guy would get if he won lotto
Bro had to flex his house in the middle of the video
Why do you think you&#39;re safe in the water. Darwin&#39;s law of evolution in action.
Idiot.
Hey bud, you didn&#39;t need to get that close for a YouTube vid. It was cool and all but it wasn&#39;t life changing enough for you to almost get eaten by a shark
Get your ass out the water boy
This was not dangerous at all. Firstly, the shark was injured and in pan, not a time to go feeding. Secondly, it was so shallow the shark could hardly move.
Get out of the water, fool.
For those who say that it is crazy to think that this shark would be going to shallow waters to lessen its chances at being eaten by another, you are incorrect. It has been documented in many scientific articles and journals as well as a few documentaries on the subject. <br>People were finding that sharks that were getting caught in nets (including GW sharks) were being preyed upon by other sharks in the area once they were trapped and too tired to fight back. Scientists wondered if this were truly an act of willful cannibalism or if it was an off situation of scavenging. They have since tagged many species of sharks and have found that yes they will other sharks, not just of other species but of their own as well.<br>GW sharks do emit a hormone when they are initially injured. This hormone released into the water is what others sense and is why they scatter or stay clear of that area out of safety.  It is not due to the fact that they smelled their species blood. They have documented accounts of GW waiting some time before approaching another GW that has been injured and then once they find it alone and too tired to fight back they will prey upon it. But it is by no means the smell of the other sharks blood that keeps them away. <br>Cannibalism is sharks has been something that has been newly found in the last 15 to 20 years to be true and they find evidence of it every day. <br>They recently discovered why Tiger sharks will have multiple eggs and embryos that are at different stages of development.  They found that these sharks are a species that have multiple paternities during mating. Due to the different stages of life of the pups in uterine, when one egg becomes an embryo and is hatched but still unborn and within the mother, they have found that they actually have a tendency of eating other eggs as well as the other smaller embryos (unborn sharks, but hatched from the egg) even though they are getting enough nutrients from their mother. This is why even though there maybe multiple eggs in each of the 2 uteri of a tiger shark, normally only 2 - 3 pups are actually born.<br>One last good example would be the lemon shark. When the mother gives birth at the pupping ground (known shark nursery areas in the bahamas) the pups stay in that area on their own learning to hunt and survive on their own in the more shallow waters. Older lemon sharks go back to that area every year just to hunt down and feed on the young pups, knowing they are there because they too were once a pup in that area. <br>Crazy to think maybe, but completely true, that almost every species of sharks that we have been able to tag and study has had documented cases of wilful cannibalism.
stupid.stupid.n im not talkin about the shark...
&quot;Pretending to be injured in the shallows, the great white attracts the attention of an unsuspecting human.&quot; - David Attenborough
So nobody gonna talk about the fact that guy got hit by a stingray?
the balls on this guy
The guy has the vocabulary of a 5 year old.
jalalo pa aca gritaban los cagones !, jaja
I&#39;m amazed these guys have made it past 20 years old
Poor shark.
“Holy fuck me running?” 😂
it wants to be put out misery and turned into canned tuna.
Morons………
The only frase he knows to say is... h...s...?
Holy Shit....lol
The blokes voice was so annoying , would have loved the shark to have torn him to shreds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=233">3:53</a> &quot; Holy F*** me running&quot; ! KMSL 😆 🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>This clip is Hilarious
My gosh what a beautiful animal! I hope it was okay and recovered and healed.
Why aren’t they calling for medical attention, we do for all the other animals… 🦈 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23poorwhiteshark">#poorwhiteshark</a>
omgg poor guy that got stung by a stingray hahaha 😬
Should&#39;ve gone and pet it! Soothe it and let it know everything will be OK... 😊😘
Salt water in an open wound. Poor sharkey.
All these smartass shark &#39; experts&#39;
THAT RIGHT GO OUT THERE CLOSE SO HE CAN GET YOU VERY SMART BRO.
Epic footage! Where in the Sea of Cortez is this?
Ich hör immer nur“holy shit“ ... Lieber beobachten ob der nicht Hilfe braucht um eventuell wieder ins Tiefe zu kommen . Armes Tier. Mit Riesencut an der Rückenflosse....
&quot;Holy fuck me running&quot;
&quot;Me has owie, go away hooman&quot;
Ahh your to close to it
May be he is just sick or disoriented like sometimes  other creatures (including us...) ??
Such a beautiful, powerful animal. I&#39;m hoping it healed enough to return the open ocean. Us, as humans needs to remember that that&#39;s their home. I hope the idiots that ran over that shark be more mindful of their surroundings.
It&#39;s sad to see this beautiful great white shark die with them being endangered
It makes me so sad to know that that shark’s last few minutes on this earth…was listening to this man talking. No one should have to go through that on their death bed.
Great vid and commentary. Hopefully the shark made it.
what chased it is to the shallows? it has an wound on its back so?...
WOW
Wow, that guy has nerves of steel going that close to a killing machine.
Holy shit....he keeps saying Holy shit!!!
Epic footage, absolutely tragic. It sounds like the shark lived, and I hope that was the case.  Tears in my eyes.
How to say beautiful and scary at the same time? <br><br>Scaryful shark
You have a house on the beach and surprised there is a shark in the water?  I&#39;m confused.
Why are you getting so close are you stupid ?
ummm why would you go that close
Poor shark was seriously Injured.<br>WtF you think it was hunting....
hahahaha chases great white into water, gets stung by stingray
I hope the sharks aren&#39;t trapped in the net and if they are please help them get out and I hate nets in the ocean they trap innocent fish sharks turtles whales everything that swims in the ocean please protect the animals of the ocean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=416">6:56</a>.    Lolol, the dude taking the video has to get himself a video selfie with a dying shark...smh.
Only White people do this shit….A great white shark is literally feet away from you, and although injured can clearly can close that distance faster than you can get out of the water. But you decide to film it. To top it off, the shark is hunting stingrays and buddy gets hit by a stingray, which undoubtedly produces blood that will further attract the swimming razor blade.<br><br>It is like with horror movies - the White dude always goes and checks the basement when he hears a weird noise, while the Black folks are getting into the Uber.
Too bad you cant bbq it on the beach
Andale guey! Tenemos sushi o no???
You should have saved it ffs. What a pussy
Shark Beautiful.
Hey LOOK! A gigantifuckinormous shark! Let&#39;s run out an fck with it! Smart. REALLLLL smart...... Wait til it dies then go cut the jaws out.
What about your friend?   Did he recover from stingray?  Know they can become infected and cause severe problems.
I feel bad for the shark
14 footer isnt a huge shark
Lmaooo gets nailed by a stingray
As a NAUI certified SCUBA diver, I have seen blue sharks during some of my open water drives. It is indeed an erie feeling to see sharks in their natural environment swimming near you. I totally understand his reactions seeing a great white at such close proximity.
What an idiot, absolutely no respect for the shark. Disturbing it while it&#39;s injured and trying to recover. Just leave it tf alone.
Ok but holy shit . 😅😆
Real rawness
You don&#39;t even try to clean up your language for the videos !?!? When I hear that kind of language it is an immediate turn off ...
Yo, dude!  Check out this Great White!  I think I&#39;ll go play with it!  What a bunch of fkkking morons.  They deserve to get shredded.
Enough of the cuss disgusting 🤮 words!! It degrades one’s character
Poor creature, hope he makes it
can you say holy shit just one more time
😳
... WHY HE DIDN&#39;T GO TO HELP WHITE SHATK WAS STRUGGLING  ....... ???? ..... HAHAHAHA
If that’s a 14 footer, just imagine what a 20 footer would look like!
It&#39;s a good thing this guy was out there to know everything
Was I the only one hoping that we were going to witness a feast? Of course there are sharks in the SoC. If I were out in the Sea of Cortez, however, I&#39;d be more worried about Humboldt Squid than sharks.
Great shark video. And the stingray was the icing on the cake.  Hopeit heals well. That was nasty looking.
Never heard so much crap in a video
“I’m hit Bro” 😭😂🤣
Holy Moly!  Dude, that was a HUGE shark.  Almost as big as your b@lls.
Person: sees shark swimming around<br>Also person: walks towards the shark 🦈
poor shark got injured :l
The other guy is yelleing &quot;pull his tail and bring it to here&quot; if i see this beast in shallow waters i&#39;ll be running to the shore line. No way i get closer to this white shark.
It seems like it came in hopes of being helped/
This shark was hunting nothing. Its back was broken probably by a propeller and its most likely that it died.
Dobie oh dobie ill never forget thee
That propeller injury is awful
Tweakers just going up to a 🦈
Watch on silent 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Just go ride it, you’ve gone this far.
“I’ve been hit” hahahah
The shark is injured, they often will come closer to shore while healing to prevent other sharks from preying on them during their injuries.
Everyone AMAZED that Shark lives in the OCEAN. <br>GOOD SHARK EAT MORE PEOPLE.👍
T
Should have made shark fin wine.
Amazing a combination of injured great whitie sharky plus an injuring dumbass by stinging ray n least but not less an mexican american showing his home parameter between the injuring shark plus their thrash talking vibes 🔆...  🏖
See everybody else would have ran the opposite direction not &quot;Bob&quot;....
Tolles Video. Heftige Verletzung durch Motorschraube. Hoffentlich geht es dem GW inzwischen wieder gut.
What&#39;s solution for being stung by stingray
This is so sad 😭
Bro everything wants to kill you out there holy shit
Cool
Is it necessary to cuss &amp; post here?  Just asking.
This is everyday in Polynesia..
Give Jen Psaki to him/her.
This is terrifyingly amazing. What an animal!
I love how the shark turned around like dude fuck you standing behind me for, So he turns around so he can stare him down
:(
Pls don’t die pls don’t die l’m talking to the shark oh pls don’t die shark
I have been screaming GTFBACK
The Spanish guy in the background got me cracking up
Thank you for sharing &amp; @Captainwafflez below 👇🏼 gives a brilliant explanation of why it’s in the shallow water…never knew sharks could “think” it must br instinct as they only have a very limited brain, mainly the amygdala.
Bloody hell he sounds as stupid as he seems.
What a a fucking moron. Why <a href="http://would.you/">would.you</a> stay in the water with that thing?! Injured or not. Utter morons.
Some people are fearless, why not get closer to something that can kill you in half a second
The guy in spanish is yelling grab it by the tail and bring it here!!! You frikkin do it brave fella.
Oh no! 😱 The poor shark&#39;s got a big boo-boo on his back. 🤔🥺😭🦈💖
No
One of the best videos on youtube
Love the video. Love the narrative.  Big fucking white shark!
the shark will die if it does not continue to push water through its gills let it die of asphyxiation in a 2 hour period these guys are not well educated Let it be
Your a scumbag you could of helped this shark your availability to him at that time instead you laughed and lucky your friend was stung by a stingray. Karma much. This is not okay to just do that if it dolphin or a whale would you just make a video or call someone who knows about the sealife and dealings of it as you clearly don&#39;t. And who will do something rather than make crappy videos. And as click bate non the less. Not cool. More a fool and a tool short on the box.
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=120">2:00</a> you can hear his friend get inpaled by the stingray
That&#39;s a fucking white shark dud
Pobrecito tiene hambre!
Bro acting like he got hurt so he wouldn&#39;t have to get closer 😂
Holy shit dude that’s a holy shit big one holy shit!
Is there a follow up? is the shark okay in the end? I would immediately  phone the DNR if I  saw this
What a HUGE, fucking, white shark. I think I&#39;ll wade out a little deeper to get a better look, just gotta keep my shorts dry?
Just another human humaning.
Natural instinct tells animals what to do when they are injured, leave them alone, help only when absolutely necessary.
Shit can never be Holy
Poor thing 😢
Man is lucky the shark didn&#39;t grab him and ate him, he got so close
&quot;U don&#39;t wanna get too closeee 🤔&quot;<br>Dude u close enough to get on his back,but shit frfr that shows u how intelligent them beautiful animals are,he is in shallow water to stay away from other vicious animals that a fuck him up,shark ain&#39;t trying to be caught lacking without his bite on one<br>&quot; thou-wall&quot;💯💥<br>That&#39;s a big boy tho,bro say I&#39;m shaking,shittt wen that shark start moving I dropped my phone,that&#39;s a great white,he is beautiful but I wouldn&#39;t be no where close to his big self yikes
&quot; I don&#39;t want to get too close&quot;...gets closer. <br>It&#39;s like buddy wants to be his dinner! 🍴
if the sharks dont get you .......the stingrays will
Poor thing
This dude couldn&#39;t be more annoying
There&#39;s a brainless person born every day
I&#39;m proud that this guy DID get this close to show what  a propeller can do....the damage humans do.
That is one SICK great white.  Something wrong with it.  Big animals like that don&#39;t come up so close to the beach.
He&#39;s dumb standing in bloody water
Maybe sharks get together and watch a horror film directed by Steven sharkberg called Propeller
Lol.....I believe it&#39;s too late to say you don&#39;t want to get too close..... hahaha what an idiot.
I was thinking whoever bit that shark  is still in the water.
I hate how people use god name vain
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👍👍👍👍👍
Look like a mini sub
It’s like a sea tank
I think it wants to be left alone. It&#39;s hurt and you&#39;re disturbing it&#39;s try for recovery.
Swim to stay alive 🦈 I kill anyway
i dont know which is worse a bleeding shark or men with filthy language every other word.
Dude! You&#39;re an idiot! Get out of the fucking water!
Poor thing…I hope it’s still alive
Yamar mejor al rescate y ya estás ayudando,
Stingray = apple cider vinegar
&quot;I don&#39;t want to get too close&quot; says the guy 100 yards offshore
Wow... which of Mexico was this ???
I seen a net around its front dorsal fin… great whites cannot stop swimming or they suffocate… I’m wondering if this shark died
This kind of shark should not be sitting still.  It needs continual movement to breathe.
Fuck me running 😂🤣
&quot;Holy shit&quot; he keeps saying. He must be Catholic.
Holy shit
what a limited vocabulary by whoever shot this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=56">0:56</a> runs in panic AT the white shark😂
This video has everything lol
I hope it made it.  Probably not though.  They never go that shallow unless they are in trouble.  Real sad.  Amazing creatures
She’s hurt bad.  So sad. Nature is unforgiving
So you basically killed the shark
When JAWS tries to get out of the ocean, we all need to be VERY VERY AFRAID 😲😳😲
You know, you are a total fool to get that close if that is a Great White but while people might want to see the shark, they don’t want to hear your cussing…leave it alone.
This guy thinks hes a marine biologist!
These blokes are morons acting like dramatic heroes.  I hope they got eaten in the end.  Two less useless eaters.
Shark looks like he died
Hello
Só sei que se um tubarão branco está ferido e se protegendo de algum tipo de ameaça, ainda assim vai precisar comer em algum momento. EU NÃO ME ARRISCARIA A SER UM LUNCH DELE FICANDO TAO PERTO, MESMO EM<br>AGUAS TÃO RASAS.
