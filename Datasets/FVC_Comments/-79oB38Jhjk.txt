ATTENTION YOUTUBE VIEWERS READ THIS BEFORE YOU COMMENT:<br>Buy Pearson Brothers Private Reserve Saccharo first. <br><a href="http://pearsonbrotherswinery.com/">Pearsonbrotherswinery.com</a><br>1.  The Shark Lives at the end of the video.  If you watch the video till the end you find out it does.<br>2.  This was filmed in a REMOTE AREA OF BAJA CA, MEXICO, 1HOUR DRIVE TO THE NEAREST SERVICES.  THERE IS NO PHONE SERVICE OF ANY KIND.  YOU CAN NOT CALL ANYONE FOR HELP.<br>3.  The shark never stopped moving for over 3 minutes.  It had total control over where it was and how deep of water it was in.<br>4.  After 30 minutes in the shallow water the Shark SWAM AWAY UNDER ITS OWN POWER AND WAS SEEN FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS.  AGAIN THE SHARK SWAM AWAY AFTER 30 MINUTES.<br>5.  The darkness in the water is from sand and mud on the bottom being stirred up from its tail.  Its not blood.<br>6.  The Video was reviewed by Science Professionals in Great White Shark Research and they determined that the injury was not lethal and that the Shark would recover.<br>7.  The Shark was  NEVER TOUCHED, RESTRAINED, HARASSED, REDIRECTED, OR BOTHERED IN ANY WAY BY ME OR THE PEOPLE THERE.<br>8.  THE INJURY WAS ON THE SHARK WHEN IT SWAM INTO THE COVE.  WE DID NOT CAUSE THE INJURY, WE ONLY DOCUMENTED IT.<br>9.  PHD White Shark Researchers after reviewing this video concluded that the Great White Shark was in the shallow water because it was hunting for stingrays as a food source.  This means that what appears to be a helpless injured Shark is in reality a FEEDING 15FT PREDATOR IN ITS OWN NATURAL HUNTING ENVIRONMENT.  TRYING TO &quot;HELP&quot; THIS MASSIVE PREDATOR BECAUSE OF ITS INJURY WOULD HAVE BEEN FOOLISH, AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY TO THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE TRIED.<br><br><br>ALL 3 PEOPLE IN THE WATER THAT DAY RECIEVED INJURIES FROM STINGRAYS.  AFTER WEEKS OF ANTIBIOTICS AND MEDICATIONS THEY WILL RECOVER.<br><br>WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER A 15 FT WHITE SHARK IN SHALLOW WATER, DO NOT TRY AND HELP IT.  CHANCES ARE IT DOSEN&#39;T NEED YOUR HELP AND YOU WILL ONLY CREATE A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE ANIMAL AND YOURSELF.
No mames
&quot;He&#39;s mortally wounded.&quot; It turns out the shark was just hunting.

Incredibly good story, you really great guys, good work  ‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏
This guy need to commentate every animal doc ever
Why in the name of God would you get that close to a great white? That&#39;s asking for trouble
Stupid<br>-Adjective <br>-Lacking in wisdom/judgement<br>-Walking right up to a hunting great white in the water
Poor thing I hope he‚Äôs still living? X
Great footage guys üëç
And where exactly in Baja California or surrounding was this? Cmon say exactly where it was please
Nobody:<br>White people:C‚Äômon we gotta go put it back where it belongs
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs bleeding out!‚Äù  There‚Äôs no blood whatsoever

The shark made it and learned some new colorful lingo. He returned to his homies like: &quot;Bro I was hit by a propeller. Holy shit it hurt.  Fuck me runnin..err..I mean swimmin!&quot;

Big Fucking white shark is right

Boggles my mind how someone can see a shark like that and run towards it, I was honestly hoping the dude won the Darwin award for his stupidity, would have been well earned.<br><br>It&#39;s not brave it&#39;s not courageous, it&#39;s outright stupidity.<br><br>Cameras have a zoom function, you don&#39;t physically have to get within feet of it, to get a good shot.
Its not hunting! Its stranded in shallow water. Poor shark
I remember seeing this in person down in San Felipe. My friends and I were lying in the sun and as I was gazing out in the water I saw a huge silhouette in the water and ran down to the water to get a better look. Sure enough, it was a white shark coasting by no more than 5mph. I followed it on a golf cart for a mile before the terrain became too rocky to continue. The waters there are very fertile, my friend and I went fishing on a little tin boat the day before. Its mad this video got 42M views!
Poor thing I hope he didn‚Äôt suffer too much
Please don&#39;t reference the S word with God&#39;s Holy Word in love!
Great to find the original video with explanation at the end. Glad it survived. Your brave to get that close to it. Poor bugger. G&#39;day from Aus üá¶üá∫
Imagine getting attacked by this shark. It be like getting hit by a truck with teeth.
Dale is an absolute bad ass, confirmed!
Why would you pull it in? Leave it alone. Let it die in piece
It&#39;s an elaborate ruse by the shark because he wanted a human shaped snack
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=114">1:54</a> I laughed when I put the subtitles on and YouTube simply wrote: Allah
What possessed him not only stay in the water, but to go towards it
Suicidal much?
LIKE I SAID..NEVER GO IN THE WATER WITHOUT THE RUBBERS...ALL THAT STIRRED UP SAND..MUST OF WOKE UP THE RAYS..
Stop the SWEARING!! AND IT&#39;S GONNA MAKE IT...GREAT WHITE LIKE THAT...IT&#39;S BUILT TOUGH...
ALWAYS WEAR YOUR RUBBER BOOTS WHEN TRYING TO SAVE A SHARK OR WHALE...ESPECIALLY WHEN STINGRAYS ARE AROUND...
Have these people not seen Deep Blue Sea?!

Just came here to read all the expert comments
That shark literally swam around just to have a look.  Dark black yes (the devils eyes)
I‚Äôm stung bro üòÇ
You‚Äôre like the CNN of wildlife lol you say a lot of misinformation about what‚Äôs going on
How would it catch anything with all that thrashing around. You think all that movement would scare away potential prey
This is going to seem ridiculous but could this be the Black Demon of the Sea of Cortez? This Great White seems darker than usual?
U guys are fucking idiots. This shark has a wound on its back, as u discovered. First of all, ur throwing ur life away by going so close, and 2nd of all, THE SHARK IS KEEPING HIS WOUND OUT OF THE SALT WATER BECAUSE IT BURNS AS WE KNOW. THIS IS THE REASON HE‚ÄòS ON THE SHORE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=31">0:31</a> and that&#39;s a f#@king idiot walking  towards the white shark!
Man humans suck!!!! We just kill everything!!! Each other, all wildlife, and the earth!!!
All 3 people in the video get wounded by stingrays, pretty funny
Shark wounded... <br>Humans : no... Focus on my stingrays sting wound

No one in the comments watched the whole video. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br><br><br><br><br>Or read the pinned comment
At around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=240">4:00</a>, it turns around and then lifts it‚Äôs head outta the water to get a peek at what is screaming and saying holy shyt over and over. Also, sharks are super resilient, tenacious and have almost comic book like regenerative powers. It is not mortally wounded by the scratch on its back. It was probably hunting sting rays and got caught by the low tide
wonder who the hell dislikes this video, never seen footage like that....
Put it out of its misery and get the grips out them teeth are worth 600 dollars each
I&#39;m not one of those people that says humans are never on the menu for Great Whites. Because we absolutely have been and will be again. But I will say that we are not something that they care to feed on with any type of regularity.. even if you&#39;re one of those conspiracy theorists that think that the entire world is hiding the true amount of attacks, which is complete bullshit, there is never a day that there are not great whites within ten feet of people probably hundreds of times worldwide. If we truly were something that a great white wanted to eat as a commonplace in their diet, there would be attacks every single day multiple times a day all across the world. I mean there&#39;s just one single guy that has a channel on YouTube where he uses a drone to film great white swimming right by human beings. Just one person. There are thousands of great whites within feet of people everyday. If they wanted to eat us, we are absolutely inferior within the water and would be easy prey. They could eat Us by the dozens every day. Yet there&#39;s only a handful of attacks worldwide and even less fatalities. And of those fatalities very rarely are we actually eating. And yes I&#39;ve seen the video of the guy in Australia I didn&#39;t say that we never get eaten I just said that generally that&#39;s not the case. But let&#39;s just say that you&#39;re tinfoil-hat beliefs are correct and they are hiding shark attacks. Let&#39;s say instead of the 2-5 fatal great white attacks that we had in a year they lied and there was actually 50. Now that is being insanely generous. That is granting an outrageous number of hidden fatalities. That&#39;s still only 50 fatalities out of the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of opportunities that a great white would have at humans every year. That&#39;s nothing. There would be frequent fatalities every single day every single year all over the world many many many times per day if they truly wanted to eat us.

Where did it happened?
Terrible, nobody help to this poor shark, she lost a lot of blood...
Poor shark I hate that people are so careless. I hope he or she survived. Between the carelessness of others and the pair of orcas killing great whites for their liver and leaving the body. Scientists are still trying to figure out why. One thought recently and I think they&#39;re right it&#39;s their food supply being affected by overfishing they leave an area where food is more easily found and the orcas are going after another source for liver and fatty acids.  I&#39;m also worried for a great white female named Deep Blue she&#39;s about 20 feet long possibly one of the oldest but also the largest she recently had offspring she is very scarred from battles and mating. She is also the most gentle over 1000 people have swam with her she&#39;s a beauty she&#39;s so huge. Only professional shark drivers swim with her. Look her up there are many images of her. She stays out in deep ocean only.

still one of the coolest videos ever

It would be cool to watch this video without listening to this guys annoying commentary the whole time.  I actually feel sorry for that Great White.  He looks very injured.
This guy nuts
The only thing that really bothers me about this video is your filthy mouth. Seriously do you really need to drop the F word ? There maybe kids watching and I‚Äôm sure you could use better language.
Stop blaspheming and try to get the shark some help...
As an Aussie this is just hilarious except for the sharks&#39; story. Just push it out like everyone else does then &quot;bro,dude,ow,man&quot; together. Ray stings do suck but they aren&#39;t bad. For me it&#39;s been 1 - Stonefish (boat ramp) 2 Bluebottle/Man-O-War (surfing) and 3 - Ray strike to the heel (fishing).

What an absolutely amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience. She was so beautiful. I hope she made it! Its amazing the strength and energy she had even being hurt and god knows what else shed been through and the fact that she seemed totally unbothered by him. Great footage! Hope that sting ray sting is better. Luckily I haven&#39;t been got yet but more jelly fish stings than I care to think about
you know what else they go after when they are injured or sick.  humans ü§£ probably was after you lol.  there was an attack where a woman got bit in half in 3 feet of water on a beach with like 20 other people within 50 feet.

The title is wrong it came in to shallow because it had been hit by a propeller it‚Äôs a sitting duck in the deep ocean it knows it too so it came close to shore , humans always destroy everything
Humans are simply destroying everything. What sup with the vulgarity? If this guy had a higher IQ he would have a more interesting vocabulary. Get a high caliber gun and put a bullet in the head. Then pull him ashore and dress the carcass for food. This is not rocket science,  although for these clowns it may be.
Great video

Poor creature..I feel bad for it. He&#39;s hurt

Very good clip. It is a pity the commentator has such a limited vocabulary.
Call the authorities so that they can do something to fix that beautiful shark ya dum f**k.
Is bad that if I saw it I would touch the shark
E o babaca ali na beirada
Of all the dumbest things you could is run towards a Shark, the kindest thing you could do for is tow it in, at least it then wouldn‚Äôt become Food for other Skarks.
Once in a lifetime experience!  Amazing footage bud!  I was very pleased to learn that he/she was ok and doing what comes natural to recover fully üòä. Thanks so much for sharing this awesome experience. Cheers
Umm....., I&#39;d probably get out of the water!!

Knocked him over or out,  an chewed his ass up like some of the fish and/or rays it may have been feeding on to survive. That thing knew what it was doing,  in <b>&quot;food will come to me&quot;</b> survival mode.
Some nerds would risk they life for likes on YouTube omg
I was hoping the shark bit his leg off ,what a moron
Omg you got so close!!

im hit bro. sent me
Stupid guy in the background keep yelling grab him and bring him to shore
Why not leave him alone?
You guys should have killed that shark on the spot.
I guess people don‚Äôt know what is it that you actually do for a living, lol. You‚Äôre just a ‚Äústupid‚Äù person filming a white shark. Also only ‚Äústupid‚Äù people will turn their ‚Äúbacks‚Äù to a white shark in very shallow water that can‚Äôt get any closer to you, unless it really wants to get stuck, and die before high tide rolls in, lol. Awesome how many google experts tried to educated you on, instead of looking you up first, lol..
&quot;That thing has so much built up power in it right now, and it&#39;s dying.&quot;<br>I was entirely unaware that sharks are batteries in disguise. They must charge up via secret undersea pyramids. Then swim to the shallows to dock with the hidden retractable power cables. I think this man may have unintentionally gave away a big secret.
Imagine being out there having a swim and that great white rolled inüò≥
Hay acosadores hasta en oc√©ano! Te mereces un mordisquito!
All you did is to capture it on video...why you didnt call authorities or animal rescue to somehow give that poor shark needed 1st aid treatment from its injuries!! duh!?!
Only, only a white guy would venture so far out on the water while a Great White Shark is feeding...only a white guy would want to!!!!!
The main reason he stayed inland is because.....open wound will attract bigger sharks and kill it. They eat inland until scar heals and is not fleshy anymore.
All it takes is one quick turn for a video to turn into a memorial. <br><br>Very nice video nonetheless.
Leave it the shit alone!
Dude he will make!
Scary
Not a chance would I go in that sea.  I am terrified of fish and sharks no no no xx
Yeah but they didn&#39;t know it was wounded when they walked out there that wasn&#39;t to smart .
Your friend gets bitten/ stung &amp; YOURE CONTINUING TO VIDEO TAPE ?!?! üò≤ ü§î.... üôÑ
What an expirence!!
His friend get stung by sting ray n he stays in the water with it n a great white man just for views it woulda bin funner er if the guy got eten

It looks about 12 feet
Yes he did, pal- it`s Couloussesm , a litle propellar dosent killed him ? you two are stupid..absoloutley! And he will not jump, he will lurk you out or come next summer you are dead man..
I don‚Äôt care what you say that is clickbait the Great white has been hit by a boats propeller and it has severed spinal cord and can‚Äôt switch and it close to death that‚Äôs why you said it was ok at the end with a blank screen with voiceover I think it disgusting just to get views
Dude not to smart please be careful üôè
It isn‚Äôt hunting, great whites come up from underneath it‚Äôs prey. You should be getting help if this happens as great whites can‚Äôt stay stationary for long amounts of time. Also stay far away from the fish, as it could see you as a threat.
Very good movie (mean pictures) and idiotic, vulgar comment.
Doesn‚Äôt ANYONE read the creator‚Äôs msgs (above Comments Section, or ANYWHERE?) prior to asking questions or making ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù statements? Or even bother to watch (entire) video?? Ok. To save other comment readers (YOU! üòÉ) some major aggravation in reading future repetitive comments/statements/questions, let me try to nutshell the Top However Many questions which needed to be answered 7,498 times below. Here we go! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  üåä YES. The ü¶à lived. It was in the shallow water due to injury, temporarily hunting stingrays while it healed up (time, food, rest). Being in shallows served 2 purposes, health was the 1st, 2nd was safety. Being injured put the shark at risk of predation from others (sharks, orcas, dolphins..). There is MUCH argument about this below. A simple web search should clear up any confusion you may have as to whether or not dolphins are predators of great whites, for instance. Additionally, it is instinct that led the shark to do these things, like salmon swimming upstream to spawn, or newborn fawns to lay still &amp; silent for 27 hours. No ‚Äúconscience decision making‚Äù needed. Don‚Äôt try to ‚Äúthink like a shark.‚Äù We absolutely cannot. And- stingrays do not ‚Äúbite‚Äù (they don‚Äôt have teeth), it‚Äôs their barbed stinger at the end of their tail - which is attached to a venom gland - that you have to watch out for. (And y‚Äôall are worried about a statistically - comparatively, harmless, shark. ü´† 1,500-2,000 stingray injuries annually in U.S., compared to 47 shark attacks in 2021. Just sayin‚Äô.  ;)  Next- yes, many but not all sharks need to have water continuously moving through their gills to keep their bodies properly oxygenated. And great whites are one of them. Yet a shark‚Äôs body does not necessarily have to constantly be in motion to accomplish this. Turning into the tide, opening &amp; closing the mouth to push H2O through, &amp; using any rip tides/underwater currents, etc. will get the job done. Esp as you see here for short periods of time. Also a hot topic for some: ‚Äúthe thumbnail is a lie!‚Äù - ‚Äúit‚Äôs clickbait!‚Äù‚Ä¶ Well, clearly YOU did not watch the (entire?) video. Go to minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=222">3:42</a> üêô.  üêüAnd related to this clickbait argument- the beautiful Carcharodon carcharias WAS indeed HUNTING. Stingrays. See above. Next up ‚Äî THE SWEARING! The CUSSING! ü§≠üò±ü§Ø OHHH THE SKYYY IS FALLING!! Good heavens to Betsy, come ON, grown-up people. I‚Äôve never actually seen such an over the top ‚Ä¶ responsible I guess you‚Äôd say?  ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING that there would be ‚ÄúThe Devil‚Äôs Language‚Äù used herein. üëÄ  (lol üôÑ) I mean - ya coulda just muted. ?? That‚Äôs it. End of story. But nooooo. Had to get all ‚Ä¶ JUDGE-Y. üòµ‚Äçüí´  lol Big high five to Dirty D the Saxophone Player for going over &amp; above for Those With Their Heads Willfully Hidden In The Sand of the world. (Pppssttt .. your kids use those words at school. Just a lil‚Äô secret from me ‚Ä¶ to you, Sunshine. ü•≥)  So! As far as ‚Äúwhy they didn‚Äôt get help‚Äù - the creator does a fantastic job of explaining that himself above in the Comment Section. (Mexico is NOT AT ALL like the U.S. Don‚Äôt try to compare them‚Ä¶. üèñ) Lastly, per the physical wounds &amp; everything having to do with the specific physiology of the shark - one of the top commenters is a veterinarian who dives into that aspect and covers it all in depth. Just scroll a bit (8 months ago) &amp; her post should be easy to find; she did a phenomenal job I think! ü¶Ä Remember to protect our seas!

They are not hunting. It is either mating or birthing place certain times of the year. Pleaselet people protect this area
WOW
Es gracioso escuchar gritar a un ignorante; halalo halalo, halalo de la cola, pero el no se acerca a hacer lo que pide üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ, ignorante......no sabe el poder que tiene ese animal...............
HOLY SHIT ! üòÇ
Stupid MF out missing with it
Should have called this the holy F video LOL
Help the great fish you losers
I don&#39;t think anyone wonders if they&#39;re sharks in the Sea of Cortez in M√©xico. Years and Years of shark week has to taught us that.
I hope your friend that got hit by a stingray I can‚Äôt do nothing for the shark
You shouldn‚Äôt say bad words. It is not necessary
I wouldn&#39;t  be in the water  with a huge white  shark even if the shark is injured!
That&#39;s  scary  how close to shore they are!
Listening to the two guys &amp; their height of excitement &amp; fascination was equally as interesting as getting a close up of a Great White!! The guy filming in the water was simply blown away. While the guy on shore went on so hard I don&#39;t believe he ever took a breath.ü§£ü§£ sorry for all your troubles &amp; thank you for the Great White video ü¶àüíüü¶à
I don‚Äôt see the shark mating or defecating so I don‚Äôt know where all the filthiness comes from. I never one time heard the F word growing up. Not once. And now it‚Äôs just everywhere it‚Äôs verbal pollution like a sewage.  STOP IT.
Gonna need a bigger ship
Leave the sharks in the water
Shit is not holy
Get out of the water U dope
Trash mouth. Shows extreme intelligence.
Which part of the Baja is this place?.<br>By the way 2 guys got hit by sting rays <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=122">2:02</a> üòÇ one of those days
omg is that a shark?  ok lets get closer and look...... omg it&#39;s a great white shark, ok lets get even closer.... omg its moving, lets go right beside it
Why the !@#$ is he standing in the water get the !##$ out of the water dumb ass
&quot;thats not a hammerhead&quot; - ü§ì
Thank you ‚Ä¶thank you for making white people look stupid ..again when it comes to wildlife üôÑ
The man behind screaming,  go away he can kill you!!! And he gets so close!
Could he be more annoying? Call the damn DNR - y‚Äôall ridiculous! Poor shark
Waooow mantaaap
First, that is not a great white. They have Grey bodies not black. They like any shark has to keep swimming or they will die. That&#39;s how they breath. These guys are not scientists
Yes, Injured Sharks are known to Swim into Shallow Waters to Heal or Recuperate until it Feels  Better &amp; Able to Protect itself Better from other Attacks‚Ä¶Then it Swims Back out to Deeper Waters‚ÄºÔ∏è ü¶à‚Ä¶üê¨ü•∞<br>Someone there tell Mr Negative to Chill Out &amp; Stop Dooming the Poor thing‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre Pretty Strong &amp; Resilient so I wouldn‚Äôt get too Close.  It‚Äôs just Resting Up‚ÄºÔ∏èüòíüòä
Better get the speargun just for out safety. Get the fuck out of the water if your worried about your safety jackass and leave the shark alone.
That&#39;s a bigg ass shark tho dayum?
So‚Ä¶you must have been holding that camera up really high or out wide to keep your balls out of the shot. Holy crap! Great camera work.
This White Shark wasn&#39;t hit. He was hit by a propeller. He came inshore to be safe.
It is dangerous of doing that cuz there can found another intact sharks trying to eat the wounded one.The shark cannibalism is well known and documented
Yea ...just keep walking right in the water ... Darwin&#39;s law !!!!

Thanks for sharing. Amazing stuff!!
LOL you&#39;re wild. The shark looked directly at you, and turned to you while you&#39;re shaking with fear or excitement. You could have become its recovery meal in a heartbeat. The stingray hit too LOL. What a video.
This a hole has a very limited vocabulary
Its not hunting. He got hurt, probably by a propeller and its bleeding and when they get like this they go to shallow waters for 2 reasons: 1. Not to attract with their blood other dangerous predators. 2. The sun and the salt water will close their wounds and after the bleeding stops they will return to deeper waters. Its a defense mechanism that keeps them alive in dangerous. situations.
Tubar√£o branco n√£o fica parado desse jeito, ele precisa estar em constante movimento para respirar !!!
So sad üòû ppl need to be careful. Our sea life are dying. From turtles to coral fish etc
What the hell are two white dudes doing in the sea of Cortez. Other than stepping on stingrays. This is great entertainment
The guy is an idiot for being in the water near it.
Stingray hit !! Damn !  Fn ouch
What‚Äôs he wrapped up in the net ?
Kill it poor thing damn
I would‚Äôve gone Republican on that monster
Way too much swearing.
I would of walked right up to that thing and smacked it in its teeth ü¶àü¶à
30 foot great white
I am an expert on tequila and I can 100% say the shark was not drunk
Hooman: the shark was injured and hunting sting ray since its unable to hunt anything else...<br><br>The shark: my favorite sting ray buffet place.....nom nom nom........
&quot;He&#39;s mortally wounded&quot;. The muffled &quot;Ay yai yai&quot; when the dude speaking Spanish got stung by the stingray. This has to be one of my favourite videos, I&#39;ve watched at least 25 times, lol
Pretty cool how it lures in its prey by pretending to be hit by propeller. <br>I can‚Äôt wait for part 2!
Its gonna eat your house holy shit!
What&#39;s with all the angry and nerds in the comment section? ü§£ü§£
Any reason you guys have to use so much profanity?

Why didnt u helped the poor shark
Wow
Sorry guys, that‚Äôs just my friend Paul‚Ä¶ always getting stranded on beaches. I keep telling him Seagulls aren‚Äôt worth it!
Lmfao... I have an idea just let me sit in this pool of blood and film this dying shark....ü§£
Cook it!
You are a dumb asshole.......is not feeding......is dying....√± from a propeler to the back...... you asshole stupid
Leave it there to die. It wouldn&#39;t help you if you were hurt lol

Bro! That shark was huge!!
My definition of ‚Äútoo close‚Äù, would anywhere that‚Äôs not on shore.

Fuck me runnin üòÇüòÇüòÇ  this whole shii was so freakin awesome!!
Shark looks fake
It would be nice if he stopped saying &#39;shit&#39; so much. Sir ... You live next to the ocean. The ocean has fish. Big and small. So yep, it&#39;s close to your house.
That&#39;s why they call them the great white sharks . Because they get so big.
Interesting video, but it was dangerous of him to get that close to the shark.
Is there no animal rescue where this is filmed?
It‚Äôs a great white shark ü¶à proceeds to go in front of it
I just wish the guy filming wouldn&#39;t have said &quot; f**kin white shark &quot; as every other words out of his mouth. He ruined the video.
Is the guy standing there showing off while walking towards it?
Working on a Darwin here.
He suffered an attack from an orca
Then they wonder how people die from shark
Like I said get out of the water stupid I told you when there&#39;s blood get out of the water and you&#39;re going to get bit and there&#39;s going to be something like I said that&#39;s going to come and they&#39;re going to want to eat that shark so if you don&#39;t get out of the water you&#39;re going to be food too if you&#39;re going to play in the water you need to know about what&#39;s in the water you need to know and learn things about the ocean and what&#39;s in it your friend just got bit and now there&#39;s going to be human blood in the water and that&#39;ll be even worse you better get out of the water before you become dinner
If he&#39;s bleeding out you should get out of the water because there will be others that will come for him and eat him
Well if he&#39;s been hit by a propeller he&#39;s probably going to die cuz I was trying to figure out why was he leaning one way so he&#39;ll probably die because he won&#39;t be able to swim right I had a fish one time in my aquarium that I didn&#39;t know that sharks attack angel fish I didn&#39;t know that I went and got my angel fish a little friend and it attacked my angel fish messed up its top 10 so he was leaning to the side so when their fins get out of whack they start leaning a certain way they can&#39;t get their balance in the water so he&#39;s going to die unless help comes along and they fixes them you know the national wildlife they can come in and get the shark if you were to call them and they could fix the shark poor shark I don&#39;t know why people can&#39;t leave these big fish alone
This shark is not hunting there&#39;s going to be a big earthquake it&#39;s going to come this shark knows something&#39;s wrong they can feel it in the Earth they know something&#39;s wrong you&#39;re going to be seeing a lot of sharks and a lot of this kind of stuff and then a huge earthquake is going to hit but I can&#39;t tell you where the earthquake will hit but it&#39;s going to be a good size one you&#39;re going to be seeing a lot of amazing crap going on it is awesome to see him out there like that but but it&#39;s not normal üíôüíö
What I like to know why do people use the word holy shit so much what does it mean? Does that mean shit with a lot of holes in it? Oh I know what it means that‚Äôs when a Christian is taking a dump After eating chili fries with Swiss cheese
Why is everyone so surprised to see great white sharks in the ocean it&#39;s the ocean that&#39;s where they live

The amount of people doing innocent things who get attacked by sharks and then there&#39;s this fucking moron who walks away unscathed, there is no justice in the world.
That&#39;s a very dangerous shark. It is wounded by a propeller.
I think I would have passed out
FFS, instead of wading up to it like a f* cking idiot, you should have called the coastguard to have them bring a marine specialist.  That shark was in distress and didn‚Äôt need your f* cking stupid dumb ass close to it.
The fact that they&#39;re just like&quot;that&#39;s narly!&quot; ????! Oh heck nah that will haunt me for the rest of my life
How do you know it got hit by a propeller?
Holy Moly weeks!
His friend was stuck by a sting ray and he just kept his cool üòÇ
Your Friend got hit. Someone pee on him.
This is why we need to start giving them space. He is dying that&#39;s why he is in the beach.
When animals like this come to shallow waters he is dying and in pain. This is where they come to die in the beach.
Someone please tell that guy in the background.......to SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!
Why run towards it üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ
I would love to know why you weren&#39;t afraid that the shark wouldn&#39;t pull u out into deeper water please? I was terrified for you while watching ü§ê
The only thing that eats sting rays is sharks
Huge? And hunting? Let&#39;s run out there.
Awesome video. Looked like a Thresher at first from the tail but once I saw his face and underside I agreed. Sharks are amazing creatures and I swear I won&#39;t kill em anymore. I have shark Karma, Many Makos and Threshers under my belt and on the Bar B.. Actually as an avid fisher(person) lol&lt;üòÜ . I started keeping Betta fish 8 months ago and just decided I don&#39;t want to kill them anymore..lobster and crab yes. Fish NO
New subscriber ü¶à
A sad death..
I think he said &quot;holy shit&quot; 50 times or more. I had to turn off the sound
I believe the shark was just asking for you to come closer and play with it. Some sharks are like that they just want to play from time to time. He was hoping you could play a few bars of the John Williams Jaws theme.

Thku for this video it was really interesting
Pair of idiots....
Nice house, living the dream!
Well done x great the shark wasn&#39;t fatally injured. Great footage
&quot;something bit me&quot; said a morron 2 meters aways from seas greatest predator failing to realise the magnitude of his idiocity.
I&#39;m so sorry for the shark.  He is in excruciating pain and all because people are cruising the seas in boats irresponsibly üò™üò•üòî You couldn&#39;t have helped him without hurting yourself.<br>He is beautifully tall ‚ù§
Holy shit is right!
Il n a pas l air d √™tre un requin blanc! Plus un requin tigre . Mais m√™me il n est pas dangereux , il veut juste qu on l aide a s en sortir pour repartir au large. Y a t il d autre soigneurs animalier ici ???
I was hoping the shark would attack. Gladly the stingrays stepped in to save the day
Go out farther and see better
You said it was hit by a propeller and it is clearly dying, how about just shut up leave the scene and let it die in peace - think about how you would be feeling in his condition
Dude turning his back to a shark!  Lol good thing the shark was full
Pretty sure that shark did not make it
You&#39;ve got the best house position omg
Definitely a great white the poor thing doesn&#39;t like it&#39;s going to last much longer there
i don&#39;t think it was trying to feed on anything,,,it was trying to heal in the sun and warm shallow water...
Poor animal
I don&#39;t think anyone was wondering if there were great white sharks in the Sea of Cortez. How does someone live on the beach and not know what is in there? LOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=366">6:06</a> <br><br>That part is unintentionally hilarious, with that stupid sounding &quot;huuuoh!?&quot; when he gets bitten üòÇ<br><br>This video was great entertainment though, seriously. A rare sight to see Great White in this condition
People need to let nature do what nature does.. one thing injured or dead/dieing is something else&#39;s food. One thing I&#39;ve learned 30 plus years of nature shows and documentaries is your not to interfere... People need to let things be.
Shark is probably fine
Only thing that would have made this video better is if the shark had taken the guys leg off so we could hear the F-Bomb with more bewilderment! LOL Poor animal and hope it survived any more human cruelty as it was trying to heal!
Really dude? ‚Ä¶.I mean come on Holy S<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23it">#it</a> so many times? Idiot!
The language in this video is terrible
So you can wrap a rope around its tail get a boat and drag it out into deeper water and I guarantee you it will swim off you&#39;re just letting perfectly healthy slightly injured great white drowned. a perfectly healthy great white it&#39;s not bleeding out there&#39;s no blood in the water that&#39;s not even that bad of a cut I&#39;ve seen much worse in sharks survive I mean they can get hit with some brutal brutal injuries and that seawater will just heal it up quicker than anything
He&#39;s not mortally wounded if he was mortally wounded he would not be able to move his tail back and forth like that he&#39;s just beached he&#39;s a massive shark that&#39;s obviously very shallow and he is huge think about you weighing 3,000 pounds being 18 ft long and trying to go through two two and a half feet of water
Well you got to start moving it somehow because white sharks cannot stop swimming or they&#39;ll die they have to have water constantly flowing through there gills. Such a magnificent looking creature I mean it&#39;s massive it looks like it&#39;s at least 18 ft long. Maybe a little bigger but it&#39;s beached itself and it&#39;s got a nasty little injury on his backside but I&#39;ve seen injuries like that on a white shark that are a whole lot worse fact is it just could be a very old shark.
Incredibly large shark thrasing around visibly in the water and this champs just walking right towards it, what a beast
Language
it isn&#39;t hunting it&#39;s dying from propeller strike
As someone who watches YouTube videos all day long. I can confirm this is a YouTube video
F**k me running <br>Lmfao
Humans destroy everything
Stay away from the shark. It still bites
That sea is hust nasty great whites attacking boats giant squid and sting rays attacking people never going to cortz I see so many dam horror stories from the sea of cortez
Almost thought it was giant trasher how high that tail was tell he looked out of the water that was my favorite part when he puts his head up like what am I hearing no one ruling up to help him like orca thought they need to keep moving
Soprised their isn&#39;t more videos of this same shark being seen next few day In shallow water
Read about a guy who was in a boat and his problem was damaged buy a propeller back some years ago shark did so much damage it sank I&#39;d bet this could be same shark when I heard of it I thought to stop a boat propeller shark must of Ben  hurt it ac y ugly sank the boat from the broke propeller coming threw to the inboard I&#39;ll bet this is the shark it&#39;s right in the area dumb ass shark
Isnt a jaws
I liked the video but I can‚Äôt stand the cursing.
Shark be like: Jesus shut the fuck up i want to rehearse here!
Just another video proving how dumb humans are
Lol Great Whites and Stingrays....sounds like a great vacation spot to me.
Dude started speaking perfect English after perfect Spanish,  gold lolll
This shark does not hunt in shallow water, but dies. The great white shark must move in order to breathe. When she stands still, she suffocates.
that shark will be fine, a sharks healing factor is pretty impressive
Dude, you should swim out and free it, it wont hurt you, it will be happy you freed it. Its ok hes just looking for food or mistaken identity.
Hear of  a guy who was sunk buy giant shark that attacked his prop in sea of Cortese  I&#39;ll bet this could be that Shark

If that shark was bleeding out you‚Äôd be in a pool of blood, that‚Äôs a mere flesh wound
Go back it‚Äôs gonna eat u lol
Couldn&#39;t that shark swim towards him like suddenly?  Am I the only one thinking I wouldn&#39;t have my back towards him.
Why is he going near that big thing?
Mitgef√ºhl ‚ù§Ô∏è mit diesem gro√üartigen Mitgesch√∂pf &amp; wichtigem Meeresbewohnerüåà
Poor shark. I love ‚ù§Ô∏è sharks!
Pretty sure it&#39;s not hunting in shallow water. Has a massive wound on it&#39;s back behind it&#39;s dorsal fin and went to shallow water to protect itself until it heals a little bit and can defend itself. Pretty weird how it sits in place for long periods, all of the experts say they have to continuously move to breath or will die.
I hate know it alls‚Ä¶and you Dale are a know it all! First of all you immediately assumed it was hit by a propeller. There are heaps of other explanations as to why it could have been deeply cut in the back. How do you know a Samurai wasn‚Äôt practicing on the beach earlier with his sword, noticed the shark and walked into the water and hacked at it a couple of times. Samurais are known to have a temper. Then you assumed that your friend stepped on a sting ray‚Ä¶.maybe it was a part of that sword which broke off after hitting the shark. You see! Don‚Äôt be so quick to know all the answers. Thanks for the footage though.
You better let that shark out.
sad video
Be nice if you helped it to swim away
Dude ? What are we 15 years old ?
Lets stand 10 feet from a shark and complain from a stingray bite but not worry about that shark  turning around and biting your ass off
I‚Äôd have a stroke seeing this in the water
WHY ARE UOU JUST STANDING THERE WHY DIDNT THOSE IDIOTS CUT THE NET I HATE PEOPLE!!!!!
Holy fuck me running <br><br><br><b>appropriate reaction</b>
It&#39;s like a submarine
That‚Äôs when me and my friends come teach it a lessonüò§
you  tell that dude to go stand next to it ,, the next you know he is faking a stingray bite ..  you didn&#39;t get bit  by no stingray you little girl , guy is running from a shark.. thats hot sauce on him at the end there.. ..  you want to make areal YouTube vid put a rope on the neck of that thing and ride it back Ito shore..  Stingray hat sauce and all...
see one that size u still wanna play in the water win more shit smaller in size get ur balls bring him back with sent of blood
Thanks for the video ‚Ä¶ one of the best videos I‚Äôve seen on YouTube ‚Ä¶ hope he really survived‚Ä¶ thanks üôè you got the balls to go in there and shoot this footage ‚úåüèΩ
How far was this from sandy beach in rocky point?
I‚Äôm gonna draw em in to the shallow.  I‚Äôm gonna draw em im and drown em.  ‚ÄúQuint‚Äù
You wouldn‚Äôt see a killer whale behave like that. The great white is saying ‚Äúeveryone feel sorry for me I‚Äôm bleeding out‚Äù hey the Killer Whale would be like ‚Äúhey mother fucker you want a piece of me‚Äù yeah exactly don‚Äôt fuck with the Killer Whale.
These animals are so smart and way more docile than I imagined... Thanks Jaws
Sting Rays,...Sharks.. shoot the Sea of Cortez don&#39;t play.
I watched an Orca take a bite out of a Great White and the poor thing just bleed and sunk like a stone..
Dude the water is full of blood......Get Out Son...
This commentary sucks
The dude telling you to pull the shark by the tail to the shore is an idiot lol. Can&#39;t believe he got mad at you for telling him it has tons of power to pull you lol.
Holy Crap that is an awesome video. Hopefully it lands on Shark Week
How funny and ironic his friend got stung during all that üòÇüòÇ
Bro if the shark is facing you don‚Äôt stand there and not move üòÇ
Hey bud you don‚Äôt belong here
I don&#39;t wanna get to close though.&#39; <br>There were go. 8cm should do it.
That guy in the background yelling at you to pull it closer was getting on my damn nerves. I legit wanted to beat the hell out of him since he was acting stupid and not comprehending what you were telling him ü´†
ü•∫üòî
Why....why....is everyone walking so close to this shark?
Stingray , great whites and you are on foot so long . You must be out of your mind dude
Chaleee
why would anyone walk into the water with a shark, get closer to a TERRIORIAL apex predator, and then TURN YOUR BACK to it??? in the time it takes to turn around and say &#39;huge shark&#39; is enough time to turn back around to shark suplex back into the water and torn to pieces, and then the camera man, but at least we would&#39;ve gotten a shark attack pov
The Dude in the Background in Spanish knows better
It is a white. So sad because their numbers are dwindling‚Ä¶ Fucking boats

Hmm sharks attack in shallow water . Yeah let&#39;s go take a closer look ü§™
Excellent video, dude, üôÇ ...
Love how buddy just keeps filming a shark instead of acting to help his friend.... &quot; Yo go out your foot in hot water&quot;... I&#39;m gunna just hang out here and film....  I&#39;m not going in the water with you around LMAO
Beautiful creature.   In a lot of pain.   Tryin to rest and heal ...
Whoever‚Äôs walking up to the shark is a dumb ass and I hope they get bit üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è karma will come‚Ä¶It‚Äôs called a great white lol not a white shark
I would never, walk up to a whiteshark. And I would never ever, turn my back against it. Even if the shark is hurt, they can attack if they feel threatened.
It would be easy to catch this beast, tow it to the shore, and make steaks of it!
Best video
5 years later 40 million views. Hope this is monetized.
That‚Äôs not a bear are you kidding me?‚Äô
So interesting.  I&#39;m happy it lived. I think! ;)<br>I&#39;m so sorry about your friend getting stung.  Didn&#39;t look so fun. Thx for sharing.  What a beautiful area.
Est√° pidiendo ayuda ?, Hermoso tibur√≥n üòç, que herida tan profunda.<br>Quisiera saber c√≥mo terminaron las heridas inclusive la del compa√±ero, lo hiri√≥ otro pez ?.
Please show more great white sharks
Lol<br>At The Beginning  of The Video (Minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=88">1:28</a>) There Is Someone Shouting In Spanish &quot;Grab Him,  Pull Him From The Tail Friend, Pull Him, Pull Him Overhere (What An Idiot). With The Power This Shark Has Anyone Pulling His Tail Would Have Been Seriously Hurt Or Ended up  As Shark Dinner! Lol
Sure,  GW sharks may be terrifying to look at, but there‚Äôs no species on earth more terrifying than us humans. We‚Äôre the ones harassing, hurting and killing these majestic, protected sharks, intentionally or not. I really hope that shaker recovered.
SHIT BLA BLA BLA SHIT BLA BLA BLA SHIT üé∂
He says I don&#39;t wanna get close too it when he already close to itüòë
Sad
We all know the cameraman never dies!!!!
That&#39;s me walking into the water... I actually went swimming. Guy walking by says you know there&#39;s sharks, right!? I said yes!
Dude wants him to pull it by the tail and bring it to him , then gets stung by a stinggray ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
People like him are the ones that get killed and come out in the news next day while I&#39;m eating dinner..... idiots.
Your Grammar is offenfing the Sharkü¶àü¶à
Since I know Spanish good enough, I defintely knew what these guys are saying lol. Poor shark was bleeding and hurting. Sharks are damn resilient, but you could see it could barely stabilize at times... they say when they are sick or hurt...sharks will move to the shore line for safety and easy food source...So that makes sense it was there. Glad it probably made it. I&#39;ve seen some videos of some really beat up sharks swimming like nothing happened. Freaking beautiful and terrifying animals at the same time. Also, that is why you gotta do the sting ray shuffle!

what was amusing about this, was the one intrepid guy standing very close to the deadly voracious predator White shark.  Then the other guy summons the courage to come out, gets stung by a harmless sting ray and high-tails it back to shore whining about his horrible wound.  LOL
If it had spun around he may have been lunch üò¨<br>Very lucky... But what a thing to witness close up üò≤

&quot;Hold my beer&quot; moment
Hey,  where can we get a bottle of Pearson brothers private reserve not wine wine? And do you have a commemorative Great White Wine?
This is just sad.
Good Lord!!!.......all you can hear is a couple of fast and never stop.....talking Latinos!! How annoying!
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how close we can get with being eaten‚Äù

Don‚Äôt fall for the trick! That‚Äôs how the shark on Deep Blue was getting people!
Bro what you do for a living lol
man! I know that stingray hurt!! been there and it&#39;s literally Hell on earth.
What a dummy to get so close.  I don‚Äôt care the animal, fish, whatever, when they‚Äôre injured they‚Äôre more dangerous.
What?? THATS FREE FOOD RIGHT THERE!!! OH MAN!!!!Man i would kill and it eat itü•∞Sharks are soo yummy to eat
As deadly as these creatures  are, feel badly for this shark , a slow death at the hands of man. Probably on purpose!!!
Please quit cussing i can even share your with children.
It was a good video minus hearing your very Foul language-that was extremely annoying
Holy sh*t what a Dumb ass. He may be injured but still strong enough to bite and injure you. I don&#39;t understand why you have to show your bravado it&#39;s stupid.

40M views in 5 years and the video got to me today 7/27/2022 Amazing!!!!
Oh ya,hook up a rope to his tail and bring him in dude. Great idea.NOT
Dumbasses! Blood is going to bring other fish to feed!
The moron who told him to rope the tail should be thrown in at the maw
Attenzione! Povero squalo, √® ferito! Mi dispiace x lui! Si potrebbe cercare di aiutarlo!!
It is actually getting natures sterilizer the suns UV on it&#39;s wound. The wound looked more like a rope injury from a fishing boat. It can feed in the shallows for a while.
Poor thing.
Oh well thank you Mother Earth, out the water and on my plateüòã
Thats a fucking white shark bro
H o L Y S H I T ü§£
This dude is massive and so fckng powerful! Thanks for sharing this videoüôè
That&#39;s a big boy too
Waw not a clickbate image! This is a great video, you got close up and weren&#39;t shaking the camera or all over the place throughout. Also thanks for the update at the end there, as soon as the video went black I was like noooo what happen next?
Been hit by something blood in water

So glad that shark was seen on different days, hopefully it‚Äôs fully healed and back into the dead waters ü¶à
THANX FOR THE VIDEO CHAMPüëçüèº COOL VIDEO TO SEE A GREAT THAT CLOSE &amp; THAT BIG . HOPE THE FELLA SURVIVED UNLESS THE SEA LIONS GOT HIM BACKü§£üòÇüòÖ

i come back to this video once a year its so cool
Him: that‚Äôs a big shark<br>Shark:Yes im big and why don‚Äôt you come and play and see how friendly I am üôÑüòÇ
I have seen white sharks hunt seal in on the beach so I wouldn&#39;t get to close
That&#39;s why you gotta shuffle your feet when in saltwater instead of lifting your feet to walk its better to kick one than step on it
Dale Pearson is an absolute CHIEF. Fuck man what a legend.
San Felipe Baja?
It&#39;s not snowflake pet detective jim carrey
shallow or not, you are pretty ballzy getting that close man!
Well, looks like it&#39;s a youngen, but it would still freak me out to know it&#39;s so close to my home. Crazy...

Love Dale Pearson , he is a great shark diver, love the Sea of Cortez as well!
They can go into shallow waters! <br>Love Hammerheads too!
And the idiot is out in the water with it üôÑ

Looking for food.
Only the MEG could have bit this Charlie shark! üò≥
Think its a black shark
Well he got 40 mil views
It&#39;s a white  shark for sure..... let me get closer
I guess these guys never watched Jaws specifically where Chief Brody says to Ellen &quot;did you know most shark attacks happen in 3 feet of water 100 feet off shore?&quot;
He should have called some marine biologists to help it.
Holy shit is all he can say: lol üòÇ
yea let me walk a lil closer just to be safe
This man&#39;s got balls of titanium...fuck it...he walk like 5 feet next to an injured apex predator.<br><br>His balls are made of admantium
What happened to your friend&#39;s man that day...may I get an answer sir
Get up there close to him and give him a pet on his snout
Orca did it again
Leave the fcking shark alone
Too close for comfort?
Aw I kinda feel bad for it it‚Äôs probably in so much pain ü•∫
That thing was big as hell
That is really cool.
Que venga la poli
That‚Äôs heartbreaking poor shark, hope the string ray injuries healed
Might as well poke it with a stick
Jaws ain&#39;t going out like that
Holy $%*+ F me running!! I&#39;ve been hit!! Had me Rollin üòÜ
‚õëÔ∏è
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get too close‚Äù üëÄ sirr
Cool video man...
Lol dude got stung lol that is funny
Oh man that sucks I knew something was wrong
What the heck man is it sick
Where in Sea of Cortez?
Good video
This guy swears like a sailor, lol!  All he can say is holy $hit!
Fuck  me running. Lmao sounds like something I would say
Ummmm why are you that close?
Poor Shark!
What a idiot! lol why dont you go kiss it!
&#39;hit by a propellor&#39; :(
Its an huge Black shark.
God people are so fucking annoying. Just leave it the fuck alone.
That Pup&#39;s a goner. Too bad you couldn&#39;t have tied it by the tail , pulled it up on the beach, let it expire and cut it up into steaks.  Then proceed to sell it to all of the restaurants as far and wide as possible. Shark is best eaten when super fresh. Followed by putting the remains in plastic tubs and motoring them out for his buddies to feast on what&#39;s left.  It&#39;s either that or put up with a stench for a month from rotting flesh. Brought to you by a past fish monger. Hey, ocean rules!
Of course there are Great Whites in cortez island. Is full of great whites.
I am the only person I&#39;ve ever heard say &quot;holy fuck me running.&quot; Kind of a very specific turn of phrase; never figured I&#39;d hear anyone else say it. Crazy crazy crazy
This dude is 99 kinds of crazy!!!
this guy is a moron! this a LARGE GREAT WHITE he will be more then likely fine and cruising the ocean now. these are resilient creatures and survive much worse. check out Malibu artist Ca drone footage unfortunately GW sharks are struck with boat propellers often
Poverino non mi piace vedere soffrire soprattutto madre natura per colpa nostra perch√© quella √® roba nostraüò§üò§üò§ü§îü§îü§î
That shark looks more like a submarine üò≥
Filthy mouth
Bro the sting ray incident was crazy
he looks old; and injured. poor fish. they will fish in shallow land; but he is in because he is so hurt... there are great whites all up and down the pacific coast; one of their favorite waters.
Holy Shit White Shark...I tried to Google the description if such kind of sharks exists, but couldn&#39;t find one.
Nice language!
Great white in shallow water<br><br>Dumb ass human: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna get too close‚Äù <b>while standing about 2ft away</b>
evry body in this video talking  amd worrie about life shark but not one care about what happen to the other friend bite   whit   a stingray so the humanity level here is cero  people care more about a predator animal more tham a human life
Don&#39;t be surprised if other sharks come and start tormenting him. Obviously u don&#39;t realize that shark as hurt as he is can beach itself. Call an ambulance for the stingray sting. U can get very sick from the sting.
Why are you in the water with it?  I would be afraid of being bitten.  It might be hungry.  Call in the shark professionals instead!  They would know what to do.
That Mexican guy was yelling for him to grab the shark by the tail and for him to drag the shark to shore, but we never seen the Mexican guy get close or hear him close. He&#39;s known as the long distance tough guy
Brahh get out! You‚Äôre about to be shark chum!
I feel sorry for Beasts like this shark, human stupidity dumping fishing nets makes this shark &#39;prehistoric die sad, shame on humans
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=221">3:41</a> wowww
The guy telling him to pull his tail in Spanish üò≠üòÇ
I agree it was feeding on stingrays... that shark in its condition is a huge danger to anyone who might be swimming in that area. a human in the water would be the easiest thing possible for it to catch if they were swimming in deeper water and couldn&#39;t see it coming.
&quot;That&#39;s a sting ray&quot; üòÇüòÇ that was gnarly
Holy shit I thought the thumbnail was fake but oml
poor fuckin animal
Good video bro
These guys clearly don&#39;t know what their talking about.
I cannot stop laughing. His friend is over there dying from a sting ray yelling ‚ÄúI got hit!!‚Äú and he‚Äôs all ‚Äúcool put in it hot water. You‚Äôre bothering me and this shark.‚Äú üòÇ
&quot;chale&quot; xD
He&#39;s trying to perch himself. The injury hurts more when he using his body to swim

This guy is bucking for a cameo appearance on Hal‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat were ya thinking?‚Äù
That shark needs to keep moving to stay alive that little cut will not kill that shark.
The funniest part for me,<br>First dude: Look, here comes the guys.<br>The Guys: Hit the water running, charge the shark.
The idiot who was filming the video kept ignoring the guy speaking in Spanish and still he was stupid enough to stand next to him and stay in the water for a long time.
This man is crazy lol

Standing right next to it &quot;I dont wanna get too close though&quot;
Don&#39;t get to closeüò≥ I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t mind a lil last meal!
It could of been shot at? That must of been a big boat!
Looking at that gash on the shark, I know I can&#39;t be a doctor or vet.
There was so much noping in this video I lost count. Thanks for sticking around and letting us see that beautiful creature when everyone else would have noped out of there.
Bro either jump on its back or stay out of the water
Oh my god, I actually screamed when its head comes up... What is wrong with this man?!
It came to shore to find a nurse shark. ü§£
Shark pretends to be injured. It has learned over the past few years on how to fish for land based morons. And it starts leading its prey out into deeper water.<br>You could very easily have been a &quot;What were you thinking?&quot; Portion of Sharks Happen and hals show.
Hi Hal. Starting  at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=135">2:15</a> I smell ‚ÄúDarwin Award!! ü•á or at least  he could appear as a guest on the hit  YouTube show‚Ä¶.‚ÄúWhat were you thinking‚Äù ü§£
The shark was clipped by a prop and swam to warm waters to allow itself time to heal the wound from the sun.
So let me get this straight.  It was a white shark?  And it was hit by a propellor?  Well - fuck me running<br><br>EDIT:  Hal sent me
Damn that is kinda big
Where was this?
My best friend, that&#39;s a great video. I will always cheer for you in Korea I&#39;m looking forward to a great video. Have a nice day.
Dude the Mexican guy telling you to get the hell away so funny üòÜ he was at hunting though he got hit by boat
The shark was that close to you all to ask you guys for help!! Animals have the instinct when brutally injured to naturally swim to people to seek help
Yep‚Ä¶sharks live in the ocean and they eat people! ü¶àü¶àü¶à
That Thing ain&#39;t going to make it, Best thing is drag it to shore, cut it&#39;s Jaws out while it&#39;s still alive, dip him in Tempura batter and deep fry the sucker
Needs saved
Dude are you really plugging all your products in the comment section like fn spambot?<br>Great video but im turning off this channel for sure.
I&#39;m not a vet,but i did have a cat that liked to bite when hungry named Jaws, and i can say with some degree of certainty that we are looking at a Great White shark.

So fuck going swimming there not really because of the shark but because the two guys I saw get in the water got stung by stingrays. They do not play about their cove I guess üòÇ
The guy got stung by a stingray and bleeds feet from a great white . Yea I would leave that water immediately
Poor thing getting salt water in that wound. Let him be
üò¨ü§£ I‚Äôve been hit!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇ
Son muy buenos para dar consejos pero ellos no se meten a jalarlo
As if a 14 - 16 foot great white shark with a huge spinal wound in 2 - 2.5 foot water right by the shore wasn&#39;t enough, your mate had to also get stung by a stingray.<br>You were so captivated and in shock and awe of the great white that you acted as if your buddy had got bitten by a mosquito when he got his foot barbed.<br>What an absolutely fucking bonkers scene this was, lol!
Chill with the offensive to God language.
‚ÄúYep yep thats a stingray hit you need to get out immediately‚Äù and continues to stand right next to where it was üò≠üòÇ Everything about this video is awesome
my man get out of the water !!!
Video was great but you foul language was bothersome.
Love the conclusions and info at the end, I saw the wound in the back of the dorsal fin during the video, it makes sense now!
I would literally be forced to touch it&#39;s tail lol
man the guys in this video clearly knew nothing about sharks‚Ä¶ hopefully they left it be because he was definitely not dying
The most annoying voice in existence.
Another.     Example.<br>Puerto.   Rico..<br>Drug.    Alcohol.         Addiction.

Hey buddy, you are already too close.
Who else wanted to see this douche get bit?
Hi
A couple of morons
Enough of the Holy Shit comments already!!!
Get out of the WATER!!!
Damn tough fish to survive an injury like that.
if your not going to call a professional to go help it then leave it be the poor thing would have been in pain and annoyed never mind you following it everywhere and winding it up more some proper idiots out here honestly and people wander why they get attacked by sharks ü§£ü§£
Bit risky getting close to something that could bite your leg off faster than you could shout ouch!
Well done capturing, documenting and providing a closing statement.  Thank you
Ah. This is when Dirty D went to Mexico!
The guy talks like Dale Gribble
Stop saying f word
Alternative title:  A shark suffers an unfortunate injury and is surrounded by a handful of semi-retarded bros.
I&#39;ve got a suggestion Mr bonehead.your walking up on a great white shark with lots of blood in the water which attracts more of them....please get out of the water so it&#39;s not your blood out there.
These dudes need some black friends to tell them that‚Äôs not a good idea. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hit dude‚Äù Ctfu what are we in Iraq? üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
I was rooting for the shark to get one last good meal in.
Why did they not put some bullets do that motherfucking kill them to make sure you don‚Äôt kill any kids
Call authorities
Get your title right.  He&#39;s not hunting; he&#39;s injured and dying.
Where is he going.. i am confused üòï
Such an amazing thing to see yet ruined by your disgusting and completely unnecessary language
I think he was asking you for help
holy shit i hear a dope
Ahhh? Dirty D, mucho abla... Eto mucho, mucho, wabbos!
I burst out laughing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=385">6:25</a>, him informing his friend on what to do about a stingray attack WHILST TURNING HIS BACK TO A GIANT FREAKING SHARK. The way it pans back lol
i do not know what it&#39;s more impressive , the bravery of this man getting so close to can film this magnificent beast or the guy&#39;s stupidity saying: pull it out there ( Jalalo pa ca)ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è che vato pendejo

amongst all the postulating it&#39;s sad that none of the authorities were called . in the UK the beach would have been full of helpers within minutes as seen when we sadly get whales <br> and other large sea creatures beached

Now you just need to go digging for a fossilised sharks tooth and your life is complete. <br>Magnificent capture and truly the best shark video I&#39;ve ever seen thanks üôå
The guy who got hit by a stingray may have just saved his own ass, by not walking up to the giant shark...
Just think of the other way round: stuck in shallow water with a huge gash on my back, barely able to move a finger, and all of a sudden a great white shark wearing a Pearson Brothers cap comes at me and starts to videotape my distress with his smartphone instead of giving me a fin...<br>No doubt I&#39;d be angry as fuck !
At least  they got one of them  pieti  judging e    how do u know  people age so ifiodds  u dont oan the earth u ard part of this shut if I could  I would   put u in  your correct place in the back of my n y c  dept  if sanitation  garbage truck leave it alone  unless   u leT  yo share  and have greater compassion for the giant  toilet   u age the turfs of the  titey bowel go watch the sleezy supper  dish  on Sunday night and watch the cmrrcials and half time   talentless rip off do  disapointong

He will make it if mr foul mouth leaves him alone in the shallow water. The salt water helps wounds heal. They used to dunk burned sailors off the sides of ships. The shark is staying away from other predators in the shallow, in an attempt to save his own life.
I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt stop laughing my ass off at this video! ü§£ü§£ There is just so much going on, it‚Äôs like a full episode and i need popcorn! It‚Äôs so intense and then the friend who said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hit Bro‚Äù i can‚Äôt üòÇüòÇ
Wtf are you doing? Get the hell out of the water homie.
Looks like a basking shark, still not good too be around injured fish or animals nature takes over be careful out there.
I feel so bad for this shark :( üòû
Stupid humans and their propellers.
That‚Äôs crazy. While witnessing something that most ppl don‚Äôt see on a daily basis he was punished by Gods wrath for filming it on YouTube by sending a stingray to whack him with its tail.  Lol
Lol when he said ‚Äúholy fuck, me running.   Haha
I don&#39;t want to get to close. 3 foots üëç
Is that Andy Richter holding the camera?
Most people run or swim away‚Ä¶ these hero‚Äôs run towards to offer any help‚Ä¶
The guy in the water knows that it&#39;s a great white shark, has diagnosed its medical history, tells the dude after the stingray hit to get in and get the hot water going on his foot immediately. How about go back in and and have a Burger dude?
Where in Baja was this?
Omg! How utterly amazing! What a wonderful experience you got that day, and I&#39;m so grateful you were brave enough to film it and share with all of us. I really appreciate the comments from the vet and other experts, nice to know that sharky macsharky was going to survive. Really cool video and thanks again, but seriously, maybe not so close next time I was really tense watching you! üíñüëç
Oh Boy !!!! Nice great white!!!!
Holy fuck me runnin haha beautiful but deadly animal
when that thing turned around i thought u were the one that wasn‚Äôt going to make it
&quot;That might be a White Shark&quot;....&quot;That&#39;s a HUUUUGGEEE White shark. Hey let&#39;s walk into the water and go towards it&quot;....Total &quot;hold my beer&quot; moment smh.
Sun might felt good on the sharks wound ü§Ø
When the Shark turned around Not in the net I would of Been on my way back OUT of the water asap injured or not
What a pair of idiots....
They be in the shallow water with a great white shark, stingrays and stuff, where the hell is that üòÜ
What a majestic animal and the chance of seeing one like this in shallow water must be close to 0
He wants to become a 5 course Dinner for a Shark what a dope. He&#39;s totally Goofy
Stingrays can kill
There is alway&#39;s a reason it comes to shore but look for it&#39;s young also.
More scared of the stingray at this point. Poor shark. :&#39;( bleeding out. They should put him out of his misery. ü¶à
Im an expert at identifying propeller wounded predatory large fish in shallow tropical water, and I can confirm that thing is definitely in water
Always remember we must repent of our sins (sin is transgression The Law Of Yahuah The Father in Heaven. The Law are The Books: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, &amp; Deuteronomy). We must repent of our sins and Have Belief On Yahusha The Messiah. HE Died and Rose three days later so that we can be forgiven of our sins! <br><br>Come to HIMüôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇ
Huggggee white shark meanwhilw his dumbass keeps getting closer not knowing this shark can swim in burst of 50-60 miles per hour
Why go in the water?
Idk man looks more like a shark is dying in shallow water not really hunting
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna get to close&quot;....while standing like 3 feet away from a 14 foot shark lol
I&#39;m loving our hispanic friend shouting in the back lol. <br>That is crazy tho. What an experience. Poor shark.
Thanks CaptainWafflez for your input.  My first thought was that Dale Pearson might be wrong; it takes more than two propeller wounds (even as deep as one of them was) to kill the oceans&#39; most perfectly designed fish/ predator.  I also do not believe that a Great White can &quot;bleed out&quot;.  Interesting that he or she returns to what they learned as a juvenile regarding how to survive, i.e. go to the shallows and pursue a diet of sting rays until they feel better and have healed from those horrible propeller wound(s).  Great video D. Pearson.  That took some large ones to get that close to that 12-15 footer, injured or not.
It&#39;s annoying how much you needed to curse and &quot;holy shit&quot; every other word. üôÑ
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   :0  :0  :)
What beach was that
Nice language !
Jheeeez someone tell speedy gonzales at the beach to shut the fuck up üôÑ
what an idiot, so lucky he didnt get chomped
Get some help stop staring at the poor thing. Omg is like prayers do something
&quot;Holy Shit&quot;  Dude.
bro so much going on dude got hit by stingray in the meantime lol
He said I don&#39;t wanna get close as he closing in alreadyü§£ü§£<br><br>But the HOLY FUCK ME üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§£ü§£
Why the clickbait title??

The language is not something I want my grandchildren to hear so they had no volume from a shark expert no less
Awesome what happens in your own back yard .
NAH RAIDER....IT WAS A FUCKING MINOW!! DUH
Holy shit, is that all u can say
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=231">3:51</a> ‚ÄúHoly fuck me running‚Äù now that‚Äôs a new phrase I never heard before
Thank you for the video. Amazing experience.
I would‚Äôve shit myself so fucking hard when that thing turned to face you like that‚Ä¶you got some balls homie lmao
what happened to the guy that was attacked by the stingray
&quot;Get closer. For perspective&quot; lmao
Way too far from shore and way too close to that thing...
The guy said in this video I don‚Äôt wanna get to close your right next to it buddy
What happened to your buddy ?
Did it live ??
Hate to see how excited this guy would get if he won lotto
Bro had to flex his house in the middle of the video
Why do you think you&#39;re safe in the water. Darwin&#39;s law of evolution in action.
Idiot.
Hey bud, you didn&#39;t need to get that close for a YouTube vid. It was cool and all but it wasn&#39;t life changing enough for you to almost get eaten by a shark
Get your ass out the water boy
This was not dangerous at all. Firstly, the shark was injured and in pan, not a time to go feeding. Secondly, it was so shallow the shark could hardly move.
Get out of the water, fool.
For those who say that it is crazy to think that this shark would be going to shallow waters to lessen its chances at being eaten by another, you are incorrect. It has been documented in many scientific articles and journals as well as a few documentaries on the subject. <br>People were finding that sharks that were getting caught in nets (including GW sharks) were being preyed upon by other sharks in the area once they were trapped and too tired to fight back. Scientists wondered if this were truly an act of willful cannibalism or if it was an off situation of scavenging. They have since tagged many species of sharks and have found that yes they will other sharks, not just of other species but of their own as well.<br>GW sharks do emit a hormone when they are initially injured. This hormone released into the water is what others sense and is why they scatter or stay clear of that area out of safety.  It is not due to the fact that they smelled their species blood. They have documented accounts of GW waiting some time before approaching another GW that has been injured and then once they find it alone and too tired to fight back they will prey upon it. But it is by no means the smell of the other sharks blood that keeps them away. <br>Cannibalism is sharks has been something that has been newly found in the last 15 to 20 years to be true and they find evidence of it every day. <br>They recently discovered why Tiger sharks will have multiple eggs and embryos that are at different stages of development.  They found that these sharks are a species that have multiple paternities during mating. Due to the different stages of life of the pups in uterine, when one egg becomes an embryo and is hatched but still unborn and within the mother, they have found that they actually have a tendency of eating other eggs as well as the other smaller embryos (unborn sharks, but hatched from the egg) even though they are getting enough nutrients from their mother. This is why even though there maybe multiple eggs in each of the 2 uteri of a tiger shark, normally only 2 - 3 pups are actually born.<br>One last good example would be the lemon shark. When the mother gives birth at the pupping ground (known shark nursery areas in the bahamas) the pups stay in that area on their own learning to hunt and survive on their own in the more shallow waters. Older lemon sharks go back to that area every year just to hunt down and feed on the young pups, knowing they are there because they too were once a pup in that area. <br>Crazy to think maybe, but completely true, that almost every species of sharks that we have been able to tag and study has had documented cases of wilful cannibalism.
stupid.stupid.n im not talkin about the shark...
&quot;Pretending to be injured in the shallows, the great white attracts the attention of an unsuspecting human.&quot; - David Attenborough
So nobody gonna talk about the fact that guy got hit by a stingray?
the balls on this guy
The guy has the vocabulary of a 5 year old.
jalalo pa aca gritaban los cagones !, jaja
I&#39;m amazed these guys have made it past 20 years old
Poor shark.
‚ÄúHoly fuck me running?‚Äù üòÇ
it wants to be put out misery and turned into canned tuna.
Morons‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
The only frase he knows to say is... h...s...?
Holy Shit....lol
The blokes voice was so annoying , would have loved the shark to have torn him to shreds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=233">3:53</a> &quot; Holy F*** me running&quot; ! KMSL üòÜ ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£<br>This clip is Hilarious
My gosh what a beautiful animal! I hope it was okay and recovered and healed.
Why aren‚Äôt they calling for medical attention, we do for all the other animals‚Ä¶ ü¶à <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23poorwhiteshark">#poorwhiteshark</a>
omgg poor guy that got stung by a stingray hahaha üò¨
Should&#39;ve gone and pet it! Soothe it and let it know everything will be OK... üòäüòò
Salt water in an open wound. Poor sharkey.
All these smartass shark &#39; experts&#39;
THAT RIGHT GO OUT THERE CLOSE SO HE CAN GET YOU VERY SMART BRO.
Epic footage! Where in the Sea of Cortez is this?
Ich h√∂r immer nur‚Äúholy shit‚Äú ... Lieber beobachten ob der nicht Hilfe braucht um eventuell wieder ins Tiefe zu kommen . Armes Tier. Mit Riesencut an der R√ºckenflosse....
&quot;Holy fuck me running&quot;
&quot;Me has owie, go away hooman&quot;
Ahh your to close to it
May be he is just sick or disoriented like sometimes  other creatures (including us...) ??
Such a beautiful, powerful animal. I&#39;m hoping it healed enough to return the open ocean. Us, as humans needs to remember that that&#39;s their home. I hope the idiots that ran over that shark be more mindful of their surroundings.
It&#39;s sad to see this beautiful great white shark die with them being endangered
It makes me so sad to know that that shark‚Äôs last few minutes on this earth‚Ä¶was listening to this man talking. No one should have to go through that on their death bed.
Great vid and commentary. Hopefully the shark made it.
what chased it is to the shallows? it has an wound on its back so?...
WOW
Wow, that guy has nerves of steel going that close to a killing machine.
Holy shit....he keeps saying Holy shit!!!
Epic footage, absolutely tragic. It sounds like the shark lived, and I hope that was the case.  Tears in my eyes.
How to say beautiful and scary at the same time? <br><br>Scaryful shark
You have a house on the beach and surprised there is a shark in the water?  I&#39;m confused.
Why are you getting so close are you stupid ?
ummm why would you go that close
Poor shark was seriously Injured.<br>WtF you think it was hunting....
hahahaha chases great white into water, gets stung by stingray
I hope the sharks aren&#39;t trapped in the net and if they are please help them get out and I hate nets in the ocean they trap innocent fish sharks turtles whales everything that swims in the ocean please protect the animals of the ocean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!üíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=416">6:56</a>.    Lolol, the dude taking the video has to get himself a video selfie with a dying shark...smh.
Only White people do this shit‚Ä¶.A great white shark is literally feet away from you, and although injured can clearly can close that distance faster than you can get out of the water. But you decide to film it. To top it off, the shark is hunting stingrays and buddy gets hit by a stingray, which undoubtedly produces blood that will further attract the swimming razor blade.<br><br>It is like with horror movies - the White dude always goes and checks the basement when he hears a weird noise, while the Black folks are getting into the Uber.
Too bad you cant bbq it on the beach
Andale guey! Tenemos sushi o no???
You should have saved it ffs. What a pussy
Shark Beautiful.
Hey LOOK! A gigantifuckinormous shark! Let&#39;s run out an fck with it! Smart. REALLLLL smart...... Wait til it dies then go cut the jaws out.
What about your friend?   Did he recover from stingray?  Know they can become infected and cause severe problems.
I feel bad for the shark
14 footer isnt a huge shark
Lmaooo gets nailed by a stingray
As a NAUI certified SCUBA diver, I have seen blue sharks during some of my open water drives. It is indeed an erie feeling to see sharks in their natural environment swimming near you. I totally understand his reactions seeing a great white at such close proximity.
What an idiot, absolutely no respect for the shark. Disturbing it while it&#39;s injured and trying to recover. Just leave it tf alone.
Ok but holy shit . üòÖüòÜ
Real rawness
You don&#39;t even try to clean up your language for the videos !?!? When I hear that kind of language it is an immediate turn off ...
Yo, dude!  Check out this Great White!  I think I&#39;ll go play with it!  What a bunch of fkkking morons.  They deserve to get shredded.
Enough of the cuss disgusting ü§Æ words!! It degrades one‚Äôs character
Poor creature, hope he makes it
can you say holy shit just one more time
üò≥
... WHY HE DIDN&#39;T GO TO HELP WHITE SHATK WAS STRUGGLING  ....... ???? ..... HAHAHAHA
If that‚Äôs a 14 footer, just imagine what a 20 footer would look like!
It&#39;s a good thing this guy was out there to know everything
Was I the only one hoping that we were going to witness a feast? Of course there are sharks in the SoC. If I were out in the Sea of Cortez, however, I&#39;d be more worried about Humboldt Squid than sharks.
Great shark video. And the stingray was the icing on the cake.  Hopeit heals well. That was nasty looking.
Never heard so much crap in a video
‚ÄúI‚Äôm hit Bro‚Äù üò≠üòÇü§£
Holy Moly!  Dude, that was a HUGE shark.  Almost as big as your b@lls.
Person: sees shark swimming around<br>Also person: walks towards the shark ü¶à
poor shark got injured :l
The other guy is yelleing &quot;pull his tail and bring it to here&quot; if i see this beast in shallow waters i&#39;ll be running to the shore line. No way i get closer to this white shark.
It seems like it came in hopes of being helped/
This shark was hunting nothing. Its back was broken probably by a propeller and its most likely that it died.
Dobie oh dobie ill never forget thee
That propeller injury is awful
Tweakers just going up to a ü¶à
Watch on silent üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
Just go ride it, you‚Äôve gone this far.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hit‚Äù hahahah
The shark is injured, they often will come closer to shore while healing to prevent other sharks from preying on them during their injuries.
Everyone AMAZED that Shark lives in the OCEAN. <br>GOOD SHARK EAT MORE PEOPLE.üëç
T
Should have made shark fin wine.
Amazing a combination of injured great whitie sharky plus an injuring dumbass by stinging ray n least but not less an mexican american showing his home parameter between the injuring shark plus their thrash talking vibes üîÜ...  üèñ
See everybody else would have ran the opposite direction not &quot;Bob&quot;....
Tolles Video. Heftige Verletzung durch Motorschraube. Hoffentlich geht es dem GW inzwischen wieder gut.
What&#39;s solution for being stung by stingray
This is so sad üò≠
Bro everything wants to kill you out there holy shit
Cool
Is it necessary to cuss &amp; post here?  Just asking.
This is everyday in Polynesia..
Give Jen Psaki to him/her.
This is terrifyingly amazing. What an animal!
I love how the shark turned around like dude fuck you standing behind me for, So he turns around so he can stare him down
:(
Pls don‚Äôt die pls don‚Äôt die l‚Äôm talking to the shark oh pls don‚Äôt die shark
I have been screaming GTFBACK
The Spanish guy in the background got me cracking up
Thank you for sharing &amp; @Captainwafflez below üëáüèº gives a brilliant explanation of why it‚Äôs in the shallow water‚Ä¶never knew sharks could ‚Äúthink‚Äù it must br instinct as they only have a very limited brain, mainly the amygdala.
Bloody hell he sounds as stupid as he seems.
What a a fucking moron. Why <a href="http://would.you/">would.you</a> stay in the water with that thing?! Injured or not. Utter morons.
Some people are fearless, why not get closer to something that can kill you in half a second
The guy in spanish is yelling grab it by the tail and bring it here!!! You frikkin do it brave fella.
Oh no! üò± The poor shark&#39;s got a big boo-boo on his back. ü§îü•∫üò≠ü¶àüíñ
No
One of the best videos on youtube
Love the video. Love the narrative.  Big fucking white shark!
the shark will die if it does not continue to push water through its gills let it die of asphyxiation in a 2 hour period these guys are not well educated Let it be
Your a scumbag you could of helped this shark your availability to him at that time instead you laughed and lucky your friend was stung by a stingray. Karma much. This is not okay to just do that if it dolphin or a whale would you just make a video or call someone who knows about the sealife and dealings of it as you clearly don&#39;t. And who will do something rather than make crappy videos. And as click bate non the less. Not cool. More a fool and a tool short on the box.
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=120">2:00</a> you can hear his friend get inpaled by the stingray
That&#39;s a fucking white shark dud
Pobrecito tiene hambre!
Bro acting like he got hurt so he wouldn&#39;t have to get closer üòÇ
Holy shit dude that‚Äôs a holy shit big one holy shit!
Is there a follow up? is the shark okay in the end? I would immediately  phone the DNR if I  saw this
What a HUGE, fucking, white shark. I think I&#39;ll wade out a little deeper to get a better look, just gotta keep my shorts dry?
Just another human humaning.
Natural instinct tells animals what to do when they are injured, leave them alone, help only when absolutely necessary.
Shit can never be Holy
Poor thing üò¢
Man is lucky the shark didn&#39;t grab him and ate him, he got so close
&quot;U don&#39;t wanna get too closeee ü§î&quot;<br>Dude u close enough to get on his back,but shit frfr that shows u how intelligent them beautiful animals are,he is in shallow water to stay away from other vicious animals that a fuck him up,shark ain&#39;t trying to be caught lacking without his bite on one<br>&quot; thou-wall&quot;üíØüí•<br>That&#39;s a big boy tho,bro say I&#39;m shaking,shittt wen that shark start moving I dropped my phone,that&#39;s a great white,he is beautiful but I wouldn&#39;t be no where close to his big self yikes
&quot; I don&#39;t want to get too close&quot;...gets closer. <br>It&#39;s like buddy wants to be his dinner! üç¥
if the sharks dont get you .......the stingrays will
Poor thing
This dude couldn&#39;t be more annoying
There&#39;s a brainless person born every day
I&#39;m proud that this guy DID get this close to show what  a propeller can do....the damage humans do.
That is one SICK great white.  Something wrong with it.  Big animals like that don&#39;t come up so close to the beach.
He&#39;s dumb standing in bloody water
Maybe sharks get together and watch a horror film directed by Steven sharkberg called Propeller
Lol.....I believe it&#39;s too late to say you don&#39;t want to get too close..... hahaha what an idiot.
I was thinking whoever bit that shark  is still in the water.
I hate how people use god name vain
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Look like a mini sub
It‚Äôs like a sea tank
I think it wants to be left alone. It&#39;s hurt and you&#39;re disturbing it&#39;s try for recovery.
Swim to stay alive ü¶à I kill anyway
i dont know which is worse a bleeding shark or men with filthy language every other word.
Dude! You&#39;re an idiot! Get out of the fucking water!
Poor thing‚Ä¶I hope it‚Äôs still alive
Yamar mejor al rescate y ya est√°s ayudando,
Stingray = apple cider vinegar
&quot;I don&#39;t want to get too close&quot; says the guy 100 yards offshore
Wow... which of Mexico was this ???
I seen a net around its front dorsal fin‚Ä¶ great whites cannot stop swimming or they suffocate‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm wondering if this shark died
This kind of shark should not be sitting still.  It needs continual movement to breathe.
Fuck me running üòÇü§£
&quot;Holy shit&quot; he keeps saying. He must be Catholic.
Holy shit
what a limited vocabulary by whoever shot this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79oB38Jhjk&amp;t=56">0:56</a> runs in panic AT the white sharküòÇ
This video has everything lol
I hope it made it.  Probably not though.  They never go that shallow unless they are in trouble.  Real sad.  Amazing creatures
She‚Äôs hurt bad.  So sad. Nature is unforgiving
So you basically killed the shark
When JAWS tries to get out of the ocean, we all need to be VERY VERY AFRAID üò≤üò≥üò≤
You know, you are a total fool to get that close if that is a Great White but while people might want to see the shark, they don‚Äôt want to hear your cussing‚Ä¶leave it alone.
This guy thinks hes a marine biologist!
These blokes are morons acting like dramatic heroes.  I hope they got eaten in the end.  Two less useless eaters.
Shark looks like he died
