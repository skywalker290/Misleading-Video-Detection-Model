I&#39;m more afraid of Karen . The lady in white top. Tiger was never going to harm Lady. In many zoos just a single dodgy fence keeps them from public. In India our Guide wound a Lion up and it stood on back legs taller than any of us, leaning on a bowing chain link fence. I even was able to but camera right in front of its face and open mouth as it snarled. It certainly got the adrenaline rushing. But also thought provoking. Really? Should the guide do this to the Lion and did we facilitate his action when booking the tour. Same with Elephants painting and playing football. Booked through Thompsons. Glad We did India but regrets the way they treat their animals. Tiger / Lion reserve was for Animals that were causing dangerous interreaction with humans. After farmers animals and or a threat to human life. <br>Woman stupid going for hat but tiger was secure. If it wasn&#39;t it would have mauled or killed her and  either way  tiger would be dead!
lunch time babe
She could have gotten that poor tiger killed if something had happened
Title should be &quot;moronic woman jumped the tiger fence&quot;
Is this Hari or Kemala?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=70">1:10</a>  &quot;Everyone just calm down&quot;  ...so that I can scream.
I been to the toronto zoo before
I think they got charged if I am not mistaken? Still an idiot.. he could have clearly just asked the zoo keepers to grab it 🙄
hii.. can i use your video on my TV Program channel? i am a one of the creative team at TRENDING TRANS7<br>and of course your channel youtube&#39;s name will published too<br>i&#39;m waiting for your feedback, thank you..
That woman is a smart ass
Fucking knucklehead needs to get a tune up-what an asshole!
And she did this in front of her children.
megaman .
It should be the tiger itself take care the man
At no point was this woman in any physical danger given there was a fence between her and the tiger.  And nor did her actions hurt anybody else.  Aside from the pedantic old bastard lecturing her and all the whining snowflakes posting on this video:)  <b>AND</b> she got her hat back and the poor old caged tiger got a bit of excitement in its humdrum existence!
The people attacking the women are not showing a good example for their kids either. Just mind your business and be on your Mary way.
Tiger: Back behind the fence bitch. The hat is mine now, i&#39;ll fight you for it.
they should have thrown her into the actual cage to show her kids it&#39;s NOT alright to do dumb shit!
Well who&#39;s laughing now? Got my hat!
Those stupid men shouting were just looking for drama. Typical in North America.
the tiger wanted to see the roast battle
I hope she got fined $5,000 CAD. <br>There goes your hat collection money. :) &lt;3
she was crazy enough to jump fierce when there is tigers
Yes she did something stupid but the dumb-ass that made a seen upsetting the little kids by over reacted in a violent hostile manner was the real moron. All he had to do was to let it go and not going overboard making a bad day for the children.
Man that fat ass is angry because another person took a chance. What a moron...
It looks to be a man not a female shirt is red ,black pants<br>The male with a stroller has the same colours on
Went over 2 fences for a stupid hat !! If the lion did get ahold of him the lion 9 out of 10 would have been put to death because of that 1 total dumb a- - !!!!!  You missed gods line up when he was giving out brains with common sense  ..went to the dumb a s s line cause it was shorter line up
lesbians always trying to convince people they got balls. sheesh.<br><br>keep em funny comments comin fellas..<br><br>&quot;Only two things are infinite; the universe, and human stupidity.. and I am not sure about the former.&quot; -A. Einstein
Canadians, what&#39;s a moron? x)
I hope she was banned from the zoo!
THAT PESON OS DUMB
!
Even though she wasn&#39;t in any direct danger she set a horrid example for the little kids in her charge. The men were understandably upset and couldn&#39;t control themselves but they should have held off on reprimanding her for the kids sake. She should have known better and find a zoo attendant to retrieve her hat later.
I respect the man for shaming that idiot. What if she&#39;d been attacked and the zookeepers had to kill the tiger? That&#39;s why she was being selfish. And she didn&#39;t even have the decency to admit it.<br><br>Also, fuck that other woman who was upset that he was killing her vibe.
IM HALF BLACK <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=74">1:14</a>
How many times does that moron have to repeat &quot;you&#39;re a moron&quot;?
Whose side are you on? <br>The Moron or the Moron
Too bad the tiger didn&#39;t get her...
the tiger could have been killed just like they killed harambe 😬😬😬😬 that woman was stupid and all that for an ugly hat!
Bet you they killed the tiger too like they did to harambe
The Moron comment in front of children is bad yes but he&#39;s right about other things... She implanted the notion that it&#39;s okay to jump into animal fences. What if their toy falls down? - &quot;Oh I&#39;ll just get it real quick, that lady did it with her hat&quot; = tender human meat for endangered animal. They&#39;re both morons but she is the bigger one. I know that she&#39;s still a fence away from the animal but kids who would decide to venture there might decide to believe the cute talking animals they see on TV and approach the real life one. Seriously.
Why is it a big deal she just climbed to get her hat god damnit why does he care
and this is why harambe died. DICKS OUT FOR HARAMBE
Women be like  &quot;Why don&#39;t you jump in, tigers will have food for a year&quot; xd
Made a video at the zoo the other day, would really appreciate if you guys checked it out
Where in the video did he jump the tiger fence? I only see him jumping off the bridge but still behind the tiger fence.  Hmm click bait. And why is that woman mad? Strange world we live in.
&quot;You&#39;re a fucking moron!&quot;
So many stupid people in this world
Damn that fat dude got triggered!
For the folks who are commenting -- The &quot;guy&quot; in the red shirt who retrieved &quot;his&quot; cap is an old chick and the moron.
honestly, that guy was being a total moron and im glad someone said something. that could have ended VERY badly and everyone around them would have been totally traumatized.
That&#39;s what happens when trash people watch trash television.<br><br>They try to emulate what they see on teevee.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Tiger is down in their compound wondering what the stupid Humans are arguing about.
&quot;You&#39;re a fucking moron!&quot;
&quot;You&#39;re a moron, keep walking.. No, you&#39;re a moron, you sir a moron, moron, you are a moron, have a good day you&#39;re a moron........... Moron.&quot;
Get another buy the same exact hat online , &quot; Why risk your life jumping in a Tigar exhibit to get it back ? You know what , screw it . Too bad the Tigers mauled her dumb ass fast enough !
I agree it was silly what she did, when she could have called one of the staff, but overall all of them arguing was just pathetic. People get so worked up for nothing
Everyone involved was being a doofus, imo... Minus the tiger, of course.
i thought im going to see a human idiot meal.
moron.....if that hat was soooo important then you ask zoo staff to get it. and I bet if somehow the tiger got to the guy after he jump in, I bet they would have sued the zoo like it was the zoos fault a wild animal attacked a guy that wasn&#39;t supposed to be there.
Arnold from Hey Arnold! would do the same.
But...But....I was expecting a person to ACTUALLY JUMP THE FENCE..? The Tiger wouldnt be able to get her....so....that&#39;s not JUMPING THE TIGER FENCE....
That person was a moron though
of course race had to be brought into this dumb ol thing
That water run looks skateable. It would make a nice snake run.
The tiger is probably like &quot;Both of you are morons, now shut the fuck up&quot;
He´s like: Fuck my 10$ hat is more woth than my live!
I love the part where the guy says &quot;Moron&quot;
&#39;It was a 5 dollar hat!&#39; &#39;Well, fuck me, you&#39;re right. 5 dollars, you say? 5 dollars? Jesus Christ man, well go get it!&#39;
If he did that for a hat, I wonder what he would do for a Klondike bar.
How is she a moron for retrieving her hat that&#39;s still on the outside of the cage?
That lady is a moron. Your a fuckin idiot lady.
she was a moron. who does that?
They both are stupid, but the person jumping over the fence is more dunce.
Isnt the tiger behind a massive fence still?
TIL you&#39;re a moron
No hat is worth that much
They&#39;re both morons.
Can we have a counter for how many times that guy said moron?
I think he might be a moron.
Canadians gone wild
But he didn&#39;t jump into the part where the tiger was sooooo what&#39;s the problem? How&#39;s he a moron?
in Toronto everyone does parkour
He&#39;s calling her a &#39;f**king moron&#39; and saying that&#39;s a bad influence for the kids but he&#39;s swearing at her like jesus
That lady is an idiot. Im sorry its a hat.
can we get a moron counter?
And they say Canadians are so polite
Why did they kill the tiger?
katt williams
I was walking past it today and I heard someone say something about that I just watch this video wow that&#39;s crazy someone is really brave
I was there a few weeks ago and it looked bored as hell. finally it got some play time. the reason the tiger tried to attack because the guys back was to it. they usually attack from behind. the main fence is about 15 - 20 feet high and curves into the cage. no way it could climb out.
It wasn&#39;t actually into the tiger&#39;s enclosure though lmao
The biggest idiot is the guy shouting &quot;moron&quot; all the time, then at least a gutsy girl came and stood up to the idiot. The guy got his hat, no problem. Talk about overreaction.
But he didn&#39;t jump into the enclosure, he was still behind the fence and from what I can see it appeared perfectly safe. It may have been the wrong thing to do in terms of stressing the animal, but it&#39;s not like he was actually in danger. That fat dude shouldn&#39;t have gone off at him like that, he&#39;s the one who was making a scene.
When Canadians get mad 🇨🇦
But did he die tho? 😒
and the darwin award goes too...
Click bait...
was the person a dude or female??? what the fuck
That tiger should not be in there
americans...
but first..........let me watch a moron
i gotta make a remix of this.. called now let me be a moron
That irresponsible women love material things to the core of her heart. A woman like that will kill someone over that hat. I applause that man for calling her out.
the tiger was clearly pissed cus he wanted that hat
I agreed.She&#39;s a moron.All this for a $5 hat ?
All i heard was &quot;you fucking morron&quot; i wasted my time watching this.
omg listen to tubby having a shit day cause he has no life
poor people..
Not gonna lie, this is definitely me in CS:GO.
This actually kinda made me angry
Who the fuck cares, honestly?
What an idiot.
The dumb fucks afterward were more of a threat to that guys safety than that tiger behind a giant metal cage.
🎈<br><br><br><br><br>                                            No!<br>                                                   🏃🏻
ha ha ha..
Fake, Canadians don&#39;t call each other names.
😂😂😂
Not on my bucket list! and I&#39;ve been to T.O. zoo.
FUCKING MORON
Probably it was his grandfathers hat who was a POW in ww2 and had to hide it in his ass. It&#39;s special to him.
They&#39;re having a huge argument and the Tigers just like: where&#39;d my lunch go? :,(
Can you hear the arguing😂😂😂 WTF
Cat wants eat
He is a moron.. it&#39;s not like children will only go if they see someone doing it - if they want to go in they would just   do it.
Those tigers shouldn&#39;t be there
Why does a lady aggravating a tiger matter, when the real issue is that tigers and other wild animals shouldn&#39;t be caged in the first place? Also yeah, yelling &quot;you&#39;re a moron&quot; is not helping your case of being a good example for children.
Meanwhile in Syria...
He said a $5 hat wtf that&#39;s the dumbest thing I&#39;ve seen all day yeah he&#39;s right he&#39;s a moron
Lol...sucks being a Canadian
That tiger was thirsty
&quot;I&#39;m half black!&quot; okay...
jeez that really pissed off the comic book guy... always thought he was more passive aggressive...
jeez that really pissed off the comic book guy... always thought he was more passive aggressive...
Shut up fat fuck somebody please think of the children!!! raise your kids like you want but she&#39;s not responsible for showing good example to your chromosomes and the rest of the world even if shes acting stupid. But you must have felt big - in a non fat way - to give her shit
Dang! 😳
I&#39;ve had a similar experience, and can relate to how upset the &quot;moron&quot;-yelling guy was. When you witness something where you think your about to see, and have to deal with, a gruesome agonizing death, your adrenalin fills you to the max! His was a perfectly natural reaction, and you&#39;d be angry as hell that you might&#39;ve had to endure nightmares of this (almost) event for the rest of your life. It takes a while to wind down.
wouldnt see this kind of stupid argument here in aus. fucking humiliation
There&#39;s a fucking fence between him and the tiger what&#39;s the big deal
That must be one expensive hat, to possibly cost his life.
The great Tiger from India
I laughed so hard at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=79">1:19</a> &quot;Im half black&quot;
stupidom is a worldwide epidemic thought it was confined to only the US
what you watched was a typical example of the human species,
She was a Moron... She must have been from America... Canadians ACTUALLY HAVE COMMON SENSE...
All these people saying &#39;white people&#39; to insist some stupid stereotype are just fucking annoying. Like fuck off its not funny, i don&#39;t care if i cant take a joke, i don&#39;t care if your just joking, i don&#39;t care, its not funny. By the way i am white and i think its wrong to make racist jokes about other races and i don&#39;t make any racist jokes about them as well so don&#39;t any of you start jumping and saying, &quot;but white people do it all the time&quot;. Fuck off.
almost a tragedy, almost viral.
shit i feel bad for the tiger having to sit there all damn day waiting for one of these idoits to do some shit like this so he can fuck em up to only be blocked by a second fence its ok tiger i know one day you&#39;ll get the idiots who think their cool
For a hat? Don&#39;t people understand that tigers are carnivores, and can run and jump? If that tiger had acted like a tiger and eaten that idiot, it would probably have been killed. That&#39;s not fair.<br>So yeah, although I don&#39;t think much of that guy&#39;s debating skills, the jumper is a moron.
white people
Some people are just so fucking retarded.
Honestly the main thing I&#39;m seeing is a tiger missing out on a meal and a new hat.
If I had a dollar for every time he said moron...
wtf !!
that tiger is just watching that argument and deciding which person to tear to pieces
just shows they&#39;re under feeding the animal probably. its natural instincts kicked in and it wanted to eat something.
That lion is so lucky, if that fence wasn&#39;t there the guy would have beat the shit out of that lion
why is this video posted doesn&#39;t show anything... do people have no lives ? are they THAT bored?
The tiger is so agitated<br>whats his problem?
What a fucking idiot.
Thats stupid that, that guy was calling her a Moron, shes actually so brave to go down there for just a hat; she should have slapped him and been like : im alive, get the fuck over it.
I wouldn&#39;t jumps a fence for a hat but whatever floats your boat
RT Podcast #372 brought me here :)
Tell you who&#39;s the moron. That tiger.
Lucky those guys have beards, it&#39;s the only way I can tell they&#39;re guys because everyone in this video has tits.
Shere khan
both those people are massive dicks
he&#39;s a moron
For a hat?  Seriously?  The mom actually had her son jumped into the tiger&#39;s cage just to get her hat?
the kid got his hat and got out, and theres a fence between him and the tiger, wtf is the problem? that assclown calling the kid a moron repeatedly just makes him look like a bigger ass than anyone else there.
Haha Canadians just say moron... Im canadian too
When that tiger sees people, it sees, &quot;Lunch Time&quot;! Everyone is on the menu...
Adults fighting because of a hat? No wonder the tiger is restless...
Anyone know what they&#39;re fighting about?
Lol the tiger was like 🙀🙀🙀😾👿😈👿
I&#39;m imagining it was 4 a fadora
This is big news for Canada.
thats awfully risky to risk ur life to grab something u could buy anytime
I was at the tiger cage at the zoo when that happened!
وش العلم ي خوجه ليش البنت زعلانه😈😈😈
was that harley morenstein??? haha
Why does the tiger keep calling the guy a moron?
If hes a bad example for the kids n shit use it as a learning experience to tell the kids what not to do. No need to talk shit. Seems like he never in any danger anyway.

What did i just watch?
good for nothing fattie havin&#39; a pop at the lad that went for his hat... just stfu, you&#39;re embarrasing...
They bloody need to calm down there was a fence separating the person and the tiger
Gains a hat, loses a head
Honestly, a fuck you to everyone that&#39;s hating on that guy. That wasn&#39;t the actual pit, I would have done the same. There&#39;s a 10m tall fence dividing that guy from that Tiger!
well not really... seeming there another damn fence
No fuckhead the only morons are the people like you who go and visit imprisoned animals to start with.
I was rooting for the tiger. Missed his stupid lunch.
This size of that thing, He wasn&#39;t actually in any danger how ever, a metal cage separated him from the cat.
you have you be a special kind of person to even visit a zoo in the first place.
You&#39;re a moron you&#39;re a moron did I mention you&#39;re a moron you&#39;re a moron. There&#39;s babies crying!!
didn&#39;t even jump the fence, just jumped the stupid hand rail that stops &quot;morons&quot; from falling down
&quot;Yea he jumped over the fence like a moron,<br>Yea keep walking your a moron,<br>You know that fact that your a moron,<br>And you&#39;re a moron,<br>Yea your a moron!&quot;<br><br>God I love being Canadian :D
She jumped off the side of the bridge next to the tiger enclosure to get the hat. then the gay couple with anger issues whom hate woman decided to tandomly verbally assault the lady.
In all my experience with tigers i have never seen one that wanted a hat so bad
why is everyone angry.<br><br><br>jeeeeezzzzz
Well done to that woman for standing up to that person!
Why is the category of this video sports??? Anyway I guess at least the guy had a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23niceshirt">#NiceShirt</a>
Its none of ur fxxking business. Let the guy jump in, grab his hat n do whatever the fxxk he wants.
oh poor tiger he just wanted to play with the dumbarse looking for a hat. Only if there was no fence and no children around for the tiger to play with him. I feel sorry for the tiger, he missed out on something special.
tiger probably just wanted to play
That person is Moran we fucking get it already.
I agree with the man in this video, she is a moron, If that tiger had got her for that action It may have been put down. And then no tiger to see. Or zoo would have got a fine and had to pay for her stupidity. this would mean no money to get cool new animals. Or zoo saftey would have been called into review and then no more zoo&#39;s. Stupid people ruin fun for smart people
wait was that a lesbian couple arguing with a gay couple?? lol
those two fat guys are just jealous cause they don&#39;t have the right body for parkour like that.
The real question is she a moron?
lmao wtf he didn&#39;t even go in the cage people need to chill
Wow, the stupid shit stupid people do. The guy is right--that person is a moron!
idiot
6 seconds of some lady that is only <b>gasp</b> one fence away from a tiger. Plus 50 seconds of people arguing in public.
Welfare tax dollars hard at work.
Your welfare tax dollars hard at work.
That guy is an idiot. Should of gotten eaten
They shouldn&#39;t even be in a fucking zoo. If the world wasn&#39;t so fucked up they could live freely and not be poached for their fur.
Dont kniw whats mire intense the lady  jumping the fence or the feral cats fighting
What a moron.
Basically team fortress 2
I thought only purto ricans were that stupid.
he/she should have had a quick pet
That dude was in white knight mode.
LOL
am sorry dudes subscribe to my channel and watch over 400 videos all from education ,science ,commedy ....couples caught having sex in the push real africaan fuck
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=75">1:15</a> &quot;I&#39;m half black.&quot; That&#39;s what I heard
Well, not going to toronto this summer, too many morons.
Ah!? Just for those who didn&#39;t know. Tigers eat people!!!... F@cking Idiot!!
Hey person with  the hat <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23niceshirt">#niceshirt</a>.
Moron moron moron
even the tiger was like what the fuck is going on near the end lmao
Why is that guy yelling at him? It&#39;s not like he was the one risking his life. If he wants to get his hat, let the boy get his hat.
some say he is still following him and calling him a Moran to this day...<br><br>haha on the real though thats  how angry people react. short sentences often repeating the same thing. be ready to fight if anyone is acting like thus to you.
The tigers are so damn bored something like this makes their day. Zoo&#39;s are hellhole&#39;s for animals, stop paying to gawk at them through a metal wire.
I feel sorry for that Tiger. He thought he was going to get some action and all he got was some idiots yelling at each other. He is the real victim here.
What a ass whole
He wasn&#39;t even in the pit! And it was sure worth to get that hat
Canadians r nice
This one guy is like : you&#39;re a moron you&#39;re a moron
&quot;IM HALF BLACK&quot;
Fat dude sounds like Scott from Counting Cars.
The ladie was agaisnt what the men where saying. Most likly telling them there the actual moron.
wasted
Spread the love for the guy who jumped who was in no danger <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23niceshirt">#niceshirt</a>
H
Hi
The Tiger just wanted to play!  You MORON! !! 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
For fucks sake i feel sorry for the person who lost the hat and it wasnt even in the actual cage so why the fuck were they saying you moron and basically get the fuck away from here.
Man that lady with the glasses is the most annoying one
How is <b>anybody</b> taking the women&#39;s side on this? Terrible example to set for children around you. &quot;See that fence that&#39;s only there to protect you from the predatory animal <b>built</b> to kill you? Yeah, forget that fence, I lost my hat and really want it so much so that I&#39;m willing to potentially hurt myself and teach other impressionable kids that it&#39;s okay to break the rules set in place to protect you so long as you get what you want&quot;.<br><br>Calling her a moron was being nice. That moron is lucky this didn&#39;t happen when the zoo was filled with more people. Would have gotten reamed out for the stupid asshole she was being.
Disgraceful to all Canadiens...smh
Wow even funnier when you actually see why that argument happened
click bait.
I was there that day. 2 bad I wasnt there 2 see it😭😭😭
The comming night the tiger dreamed that he has gotten the man......yum-yum.....
Why did the Beluga Whale need to get involved at the end?
He doesn&#39;t even jump in... There is clearly a fence between him and the tiger,... He simply jumps down from the viewing platform to the ground... Been to the Toronto zoo many times and would have done the same think with out fear... <br>Once again there IS CLEARLY A FENCE!! <br>The people calling him a moron are idiots... There are children around you should swear!! <br>Also I am sure that a First world country zoo would have the utmost safety in effect, and would not allow an area where visitors could jump in to the actual enclosure of a dangerous animal...
Lol at people getting so upset over something like that.
white people do this shit but still lock their doors when a black guy walks past
Dumbass
mljac,mljac ?
Canadians are so damn nice, the meanest thing they can say is &quot;moron&quot;. :P
waste of time
Idiot!
if i was there i would go up to them and say&quot; R U MAD BRUUUUH?!&quot; and run.
He /she should  have used a stick or something else  instead  of going in.
How the fuck do they have tigers outside in Toronto it&#39;s cold as fuck
The fat man shouldn&#39;t be saying shit about being a good example for children. Your fat ass is just as bad, making children believe that obesity is ok.
Tiger Lives Matter
Did that white girl say, &quot;I&#39;m half black!&quot;? Did I miss the part where that had anything to do with the conversation? haha. Guys! Shut up! I&#39;m half BLACK!
the fat dude looks like one of those Pokemon trainers that would see you and force you to fight them.
What a savage!!!!! In Ireland we would do that for a chippy bag
Why lesbians think, this kind of behavior are proper of male gender?
Man! Is this what the world have come into? 🤔🤔

I did this for my hat at the same zoo when I was like 6ish but it was the elephant exhibit. Elephants are chill doe. They started running towards me to say hi n shit but they were far enough away for me to get back.

WTF is that broad yelling at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=74">1:14</a>? I&#39;m half black? I&#39;m half blind?
I&#39;ve never heard the word moron used so many times in a video XDD
I&#39;ve watched this several times first on my local news channel then on my news app. then again on the news again.<br>WTF?????<br>Moron is to tame a word for her Kobe Bryant just retired and one of the items for sale was a hat lined with real gold now perhaps that would have been worth jumping over the fence for ( I am kidding) it makes you wonder what the hell was going on in new mind well wait ......she obviously doesn&#39;t have one.....IDIOT
Imagine to be that tiger... FUCK ZOOS
I cant believe people are taking the woman&#39;s side on this. This behavior is not okay.
Dis is gay af
I can&#39;t really appreciate it from this view. However, I feel like if that girl  jumped in and back out so easily to get her hat back.. Everybody and their mother was in danger at that zoo. Don&#39;t tell me..that pit is an obstacle for that tiger.. Obviously that girl knew there was a fence to protect her.  It is something stupid an childish.. , but she wasn&#39;t really risking her life.
The guy&#39;s just mad cuz he&#39;s too fat to climb over anything, he couldn&#39;t afford to droo his hat.
Americans.
Darwin was wrong, at least judging by this video. Survival of the fattest? yuck.<br>I felt bad for the tiger, his one chance to do what he was born to do, and the bitch jumped the fence.<br>I&#39;ve seen far too many parents cursing and I mean CURSING at their kids. In public. <br>Shame on them all.
dood, Hes not even inside the fence. Perfectly legit hat retrieval mission. And probably the most excited that poor ol tigers got in years.
tiger was ready to fuck her up lmao
Katt Williams.....this is not a drill
Why fighting??  She just jumped on the tigers&#39; fence nothing happened lol
If there&#39;s one thing I learned today is that people who own hats are morons
wtf, why is this even a thing to bitch about, the guy dropped his hat, jumped down and grabbed it, THERE WAS A FUCKING STRONG ASS FENCE in between him and the tiger, he was in no danger.
&#39;&#39;you&#39;re a moron&#39;&#39; how ironic since she wasn&#39;t in danger and he&#39;s making a whole scene out of it. He&#39;s probably just mad because that women has more balls than him and she just showed it in front of his son and he didn&#39;t take it, so like a man he starts bitching. This is fucking priceless.
I&#39;d say he&#39;s a MORON
The chunky bloke was just jealous that he couldn&#39;t climb a fence
wasnt even in the cage lol
its worth it people.. its a damn hat! you risk your life for hat.. ask luffy from onepiece..
Pussy cat wants steak for dindins
Wow people seem so nice there
The tiger is already over it 😒
Just watching this poor tiger, caged for people&#39;s enjoyment is the sickest display that humans can muster, This tiger would normally roam a area about 5 km squared and these dogs chain it up and parade it around like a play-toy. It spends it life in a prison so people can look at for a few minutes. If we shut zoo&#39;s down I really feel we would make so much more just effort in keeping the habitat of all animals , and everything that dwells in it alive.
Wow he has a nice shirt
Tasty steak
No, she did not climb the fence! That is a wooden ramped decking. That decking is protecting no one. NO ONE. IF the tiger got out of the one fence, it would jump that ramp and eat the fat guy in seconds. She did not jump a fence, the enclosure has one fence.
I don&#39;t get it calling the word moron is a bad example for kids...?
Why are there so many dislikes? Because nobody was hurt?
Amazingly Stupid!!
Wooooow who cares?! There&#39;s still a wall between her and the actual enclosure
Yep, they&#39;re a moron. I&#39;d have laughed if they&#39;d have been mauled over a hat.<br><br>However, one &quot;you&#39;re a moron&quot;  would have sufficed.
I&#39;m confused as to why this was such a big deal? He wasn&#39;t at any moment in danger.
I live in Toronto I remember going on a class trip in like 2nd grade here and my hat fell in that same place. I loved that hat. RIP pink hat. :(
GUYS<br>the man didn&#39;t die....<br>Your wasting your time watching this :/
MORON!
People need to not worry about what other people do &amp; let darwin take care of it.
look at my fish because this sucks
OOHHHHHH...oh
Bitches be like
04MSCENTRUM: SHE SHOULD BE  ARRESTED. NOT YELLED AT.
This is what happens when you play too much TF2.
That guy getting mad has some serious issues. Chill the fuck out
I like how he calls her the definition of a moron after saying moron like 6 times. He really wants that to sink in I guess.
The tigers all like...Damn these fuckers should be on DramaAlert
There&#39;s a fence between him and the tiger? Who cares....
Probably a leafs hat
he wasn&#39;t even close to inside the enclosure, calm down.
Wow, there are some real nasty people out there . Very disgraceful!. There are kids every where that have to be exposed to those animals. They need to be put in a cage with a dog collar on so the stop the vulgar language and tantrums
throw a polar bear in there! best fight ever!
Wtf is going on
Wtf is going on
wait.. so which one is the moron?
The clip should be called &quot;Zoo visitors lose their shit over someone retrieving their hat&quot;
What a dumb ass
He is crazy
Wow. What a moron. 😂
&quot;You&#39;re a moron&quot;<br>Classic white people
Warning signs posted everywhere. What a total jerk, to cheap to buy a stupid hat. I would have gotten angry too. I don&#39;t want to see him injured or my children see him injured or staff injured trying to save his stupid self OVER A HAT!!!!
idiot
lmao &quot;that&#39;s the worst idea ever dude&quot; the animal was caged in.. theres nothing wrong with a guy getting his hat. only thing wrong with this vid is that you have a fucking beautiful animal locked up.   and trying to justify as stupid, due to a hat, okay, so what about a shoe. you gonna walk around the rest of the day with a missing shoe? how about your purse? you gonna walk away without your wallet and other important items and leave your bank info and cards for someone else to grab? whats the difference? is it about the dangerousness and stupidity of being in that area, or is it all because its a hat LOL? stupid people. im sure the guy had plenty of intelligence to know he was safe. and getting pissy over a hat is just hilarious. it didn&#39;t teach kids too do bad things, and had it done such a thing, you should consider home schooling your fucking kids, because most of their life and upbringing is out of your control! you ship them away to be indoctrinated by a system that brings you up to believe complete bullshit about what this planet is actually about and what exists here. and they will be surrounded by bad decisions there whole childhood. its up too the parents to advise their children in that very moment to say &quot; don&#39;t ever do what that boy just did, if you drop or lose something here, let me know&quot;  end of the day. these people were more animalistic then that tiger was. haha over a hat.
Yes lets jump a fence that keeps me safe to get some crappy hat
white people fights lool
When people upload a video after 2 years.. yet they ask people to &quot;subscribe&quot;...
why are people defending the person that jumped down to get the hat? it&#39;s a fucking hat, the dude is right. he&#39;s a moron and a bad example.
I would do that if I dropped my maple syrup.
Hey, Its clever yet stupid ;)
She needs to be fined really bad. Such a bad example to everyone watching who now thinks it&#39;s fun to jump into a tigers cage.
It&#39;s not like she actually jumped into the tiger cage. Not even close. Still a dumb thing to do, must be a nice hat.
Those 2 dumb gay guys were the ones creating the scene. So what???... someone jumped over one of the fences to get the hat (even though there was another fence that kept the tiger from reaching the person)... why the F do they care???  What bothers me is how the moron in the black shirt and his bum buddy tried to justify their moronic bull-out-of-hell-rights-fighting to a psychotic level and not relent. My friends and I would have grabbed them and thrown him into the tiger pen to see if the tiger would react like he did. Probably the kind that nitpick about spelling on these Youtube boards and call everyone &quot;You&#39;re worse than Hitler&quot; for not agreeing with anything they say. They should get lives.
I&#39;d Probably Do The Same<br>Don&#39;t Call Me a Moron😂<br>That&#39;s Just How Much I Love My Hat😎
I just love Toronto for all of its morons 😂 but seriously wtf was her problem??
buddy in the back needs to chill &quot;is it fair, is it fair??&#39; IS IT FAIR TO KEEP THEM CAGED IN THE FIRST PLACE? like lmaooo chill its not your life
Your a fucking moron
Seems like it was a safe place to be. I would&#39;ve done the same for a nice hat. Not sure what the big deal is.
The guy in the black is the one that started it ! Smh
I hope they find who that is a ban her from the zoo and fine the crap out of her. I&#39;m glad the two guys yell at her.
Just went into the pit? Didn&#39;t even jump the actual fence? A little bit of an over exaggeration saying they&#39;re a moron :/
There is a fence between... so what!?
lol when was the last time toronto got noticed
shes half black?
Wtf he wasint even in the cage
Family guy who&#39;s laughing now I got my hat!!! lol
Apparently he&#39;s a moron.
Have you ever noticed that OK sideways looks like a person??
Those people who called her moron are clearly stupid because the definition means that you have a very high intelligence
one side of fence tigers tge other side - moronic human race.
Plz help me reach 200 subs by 2017
...Little did he know this would get 2 million views...
That guy has a death wish
That&#39;s the biggest fight that you&#39;ll get out of Canadians
nobody asked for that stupid fucking fat guys opinion
That wasn&#39;t even where the tiger was and even still that person was a moron. And honestly, stop making comments about how the guy is setting a bad example about saying &quot;moron&quot; because that&#39;s bull. The one retrieving the hat should be banned from all zoos. And she has a child? You got to be kidding me. For the child&#39;s sake, I really hope his father has more common sense and he takes after him.
she must really love that hat WHAT A MORON
lmaoo whoa why they getting so mad jheeze that&#39;s his own life he&#39;s risking lol who cares
It&#39;s the only way to keep the zoo exciting people
Moron moron
What the hell
The f#%K???? Are you suggesting I hear proper ENGLISH is Moronto anymore? And krimpass- DuHHHHHH! your comment is moronic... not in Toronto are you??? )This is no longer N. Am. this Toronto place - its da new NAzi place. Come on in and pig out till the welfare runs out then turn to the USA&gt; The border will be sealed by then and you can eat some bombs &#39;stead of pastries. Just sayin&#39;. *
That&#39;s a pretty nice hat.
Your typical super friendly and polite Canadians :-)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=16">0:16</a> You are now entering the matrix
Maybe it was a really nice hat.
What a weiner
Sigh.. The real animals are outside the cages :[
The guy that keeps repeating &quot;You&#39;re a moron.&quot; is so annoying, tho. What a moron.
the next time someone calls me a moron im gonna feel way more offended because of this video
Very funny... Gay couples attacked that woman for teaching their adopted kids a dangerous thing!<br>Why don&#39;t you gays leave each other. What will happen to your kids when they discover that both of their parents are from the same gender?!
must of been a make Donald drumpf again hat.  I would die for that too.
Why is everyone so freaked out, the tiger is on another side of the fence from him. He was never in real danger, it wasnt the smartest of ideas but he isnt a moron. A moron calls someone else a moron 100x. He was never in danger, not for a second.
Fuck you
why us people are always that nosy ? omg
What a dumbass, i would have called her a moron as well.
Good role models
Over react much?
Click bait title
dont you have anything to do how is that funny
Cypress Hill, you are the best :-)
When we Canadians finally get warm weather this is the crazy shit we do
And that&#39;s our idea of a day time fight ! Oh Canada lol
affer the incident, the tiger seems to focus on the discussion and think &quot;yes, what a fucking moron!&quot;
Did she drop the $38,000 Kobe Bryant-Themed cap?
what an idiot your a dumb ass your lucky you didn&#39;t turn in to his next meal...dummie
Not all heroes wear capes
lol , white people.
smh....people, getting into a fight over a guy getting his hat back...wtf
I was expecting someone taking out a gun and start shooting people as it happens in the US.
Sher Kahn be like, that human has hops like Mowgli.
that&#39;s not a moron that&#39;s a stupid ass bitch
no that&#39;s not Greattttt!!! Tony doesn&#39;t like you.
The tiger just want a piece of fresh meat!!!!
the big dudes family started arguing with each other too, who didn&#39;t overreact
why did the people care so damn much? It was his own life he put a risk and instead of blaming him for being a bad example for the kids why don&#39;t you teach your fucking kids to not copy the stupid shit they see cause that&#39;s not the only time in their life they&#39;re gonna see someone do something stupid so instead of blaming him teach your damn kids to not be dumb as hell.
What would to do for a clondike bar
Fuck this video go vote for Bernie
I wasted 20 seconds of my life.
Omg the guy trying to stick up for the animal they both paid money to see in a cage is too funny😂😂😂
why did that fat fuck get triggered? Classic example of making a huge problem where there is none.
There all morons for paying to watch animals in a cage
Luffy?
As usual, the animals are outside the cages.
Good thing those fences kept away those stupid animals from the tigers....
lol how many videos on here show ppl getting grabbed through the fence.. dudes lucky
that lesbian sure does have some big hairy chesticles. I&#39;m sure she pees standing up.
Let&#39;s play, Spot the Moron. if you need it, you&#39;ll get a hint in the video.
He should have just bought a new hat, instead of jumping in there. It&#39;s his fault for dropping it like a dumbass.
Moron
Over dramatic as fuck
I wonder if at the end the lady said &quot;i&#39;m sorry&quot; and then the guy yelling at her said &quot;i&#39;m sorry too&quot; and they went and got poutine together...
It had to be said: that person is an absolute moron.
Torontonians seem lame.
2016 and the quality of your video looks like FUCKING SHIT CASSEROLE
i just wanna show my parkour moves :D
I don&#39;t even know what is going on. XD
I knew electing Justin Trudeau was going to have a negative influence on Canadians just thought it would take a year or two!!.
Why put tigers cages ?  Put those people in the Zoo&#39;s cage!
Can someone tell me why the woman was getting screamed at? She wasn&#39;t the one who jumped in...
Damn, a good lot of you are morons! That fat lady wasn&#39;t the one to jump down... she&#39;s not even wearing the same color shirt..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=56">0:56</a> tiger:MADAFA just stop.ok we get it.eeeveryones a moron.
These aren&#39;t really canadians, they never said Sorry
I think that was a lady who jumped the fence for her lady friend&#39;s hat.  papa bear was not having it.
that fat fuck talking shit deserved to be thrown in for dinner!
Zoo s are fucking cruel how could u keep such a beautiful animal in a cage now days it&#39;s just sad
eso fue todo xD
Well it was an important hat he be like damn my bald spot showing cat be like really lunch is just gonna hop in damn bet the lions be jealous now lol
Why are people angry....do these &quot;morons&quot; not see there are 2 fences?
Maybe this is a tiger visiting a zoo full of morons?
worth it
You just can&#39;t fix STUPID!
The fence is real...
must&#39;ve been a pretty nice hat
American arguing: You&#39;re a fucking moron! (other person argues) No but you&#39;re a fucking moron (other person keeps arguing) you&#39;re a moron! (other person still argues) but you&#39;re a fucking moron you know that?<br><br>I&#39;m glad I dont live in the states
Moron/10
Shoutout to dude for getting at her sometimes you have to tell people how stupid they are.
The moron is the goof calling her a moron
The one that got the hat back is not a moron because the hat fell outside the tiger cage. Tiger could not eat her you see. she was safe, thus she got her hat back. They put that extra fence up so people dont bang on the actual tiger cage and annoy the tigers lol, tiger isnt going to use magic and get you past its cage, you can whop your cock and out and wave it all about, even rub it on the cage the tiger cant do shit. So no shit you get your hat back.
Lmao that fat fuck saying moron needs to get a life.
Would it have been easier to replace the hat or just ask one of the employees to get it? <br><br>Even though nothing happened, that woman could get a fine &amp; banned for life from the zoo.
Tiger be like:<br><br>And man...is...FORBIDDEN!
White people have no fear ffs.
Dramatic ass dude calling him a moron like if that dude wants to be eaten by a tiger let him ffs lol
Just a few days ago a man here in the Toronto area smashed a window to gain access to his ex-wife&#39;s home in order to get his daughter.  An amber alert was put out for this &quot;abduction&quot; of his child.  He was then hunted down with radio and television personalities broadcasting details about this &quot;abductor&quot;.  Police located his vehicle and he fled as would be expected. Rather than call the chase off as is done here in Canada when there is risk to public safety, it appears that the police disregarded this procedure in order to capture this man. <br><br> He was apparently chased until he crashed and flipped his vehicle, almost killing himself and his young daughter.  Now, the police and the media are quick to point out this man&#39;s blatant disregard for the safety of his own daughter, but what isn&#39;t reported is the mental anguish that millions of men suffer through when the state allows females to abduct their children from them.  <br><br>From the time  child is born, a woman is deemed to be somehow more entitled as a &quot;parent&quot;, more significant to the child. From day one the female is granted defacto custody (which means that by way of giving birth she has proven that she is a &quot;biological parent&quot; and given legal rights to that child, whereas a man must wait for his day in court.  This day in court many times is as much as 6 months later, after which this ownership by the &quot;mother&quot; will be seen as  being in the best interest of the child&quot; to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot;. There are no options for a man to be administered a DNA cheek swab in the hospital when his child is born and then be granted equal parental rights from the day his child is born.  From day one the father is facing an uphill losing battle in a so-called family court that should be re-named mother&#39;s court.<br><br>These obscenely discriminatory practices must stop!  We see in the news gay rights being granted, black lives matter movements being acknowledged by government, etc, etc. So, why is it then that in 2016 after decades of protesting by father&#39;s rights groups, women are still able to legally abduct children and leave men emotionally and financially distraught for years to come, forcing them to pay money to those same women who abducted their child/ren with no accountability even for how that money is being spent. Men are being forced into positions where in many cases they feel their only options are to commit suicide, kill the woman, flee the country, or &quot;abduct&quot; their child from these women who have been empowered by the government to legally abduct their children from them. Then, of course it is the man, who is trying desperately to experience parental equality, who ends up taking actions that are against these pathetic laws, and landing in jail.  This is discrimination and it&#39;s a discrimination that has been mandated by government. It has somehow become mainstream public opinion that children are a woman&#39;s domain, that women are more empathetic, that women are more sensible, that women are more responsible, that women are more nurturing and therefore that women are better parents.  This is discrimination!<br><br>Many men are deemed to be &quot;mentally ill&quot; from the mental trauma this causes them and then that can be used against them in court.  Actions of those suffering PTSD are excused somehow but men who suffer emotional trauma when their children are abducted from them and then act in ways that are out of their character, are deemed to be &quot;dead beat dads&quot;, irresponsible, aggressive, criminals, etc. Reverse the tables and see how many women would act irrationally if all men were granted this despicable unilateral ownership of the children, along with support payments. <br><br>This has to change and it has to change now!  Demand that Justin Trudeau and others make &quot;change ..real change&quot; by  ensuring that men are granted equal parental rights to their own children!!
so unadvisedly
Figures, some nosey mother fuckers have to hassle him afterwards.
people are fuckin gross sometimes
that tiger was ready to kill
That was...not as advertised.
Respect to the guy for speaking up against this trash.
yoo that gay couple wild&#39;n needs to shut up cause the whole thing didnt even concern them. like he didnt make you hop the fence.  Some white ppl just love looking for drama. then when they get whats coming to them, they act like victims...GTFOH
Guy gets angry about something that has absolutely nothing to do with him must be a Republican
If that was in Australia we&#39;d do it for fun
The dude himself should look at a mirror. He&#39;s the moron for calling her a bad influence to children while he should be called the bad influence. If I was a kid I wouldn&#39;t want to be the one calling names at a person because an accident happened. Dude should just let it go.
why was that guy so mad...
The stupidity of some people is breathtaking.
too bad the tiger didn&#39;t get him
Honestly, who cares?
this isnt in canada. How do i know this? They&#39;re calling each other moron instead of saying sorry to each other
I thought it said the tiger jumps fence...I waited <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=84">1:24</a> minutes just to hear people call each other morons a million times
That tiger was like wassup son u gonna come in here or nahh
That&#39;s stupid. Just should have informed the workers there of what happened and that&#39;s it but confronting them the way they did is a bad example in and of itself! lol the tiger was probably was thinking, yes you&#39;re all morons now let me eat you!!!&quot; 😂
In the famous words of Hermione Granger &quot;What. An. Idiot.&quot;
Gaaaaaaaaaay, there is a god damn fence he shouldn&#39;t get chewed out..... Moron
A bit stupid
We need to make america great again! VOTE TRUMP 2016
So what if that hat falls into every open enclosure....
I see Canadians are turning into Americans :)
Dumb @$$ its only a freakin hat...go buy a new one...freaking IDIOT
Hat off to his exploit!
Those two guys need to calm the fuck down and mind their own damn business. Like why was it so important for them to let her know that she was a moron. Say it once then move on, hell muse it to yourself over and over if you want, but they don&#39;t have ample reason to act outraged like they were. She did something stupid, but it had nothing to do with you.
Click bait. NOTHING HAPPENS.
what a clusterfuck. if that was in America, someone would be shot fifteen seconds in.
The real bad exemple is everyone going to the zoo, showing their children that it&#39;s ok to have wild animals in captivity.
the dude with the hat is right...she is a moron
poor tiger
would someone throw that moron into the cage
Dumbasses only excuse for critiquing a guy is because the victim of his scolding was a &quot;woman&quot;, what a bunch of pussies. &quot;How can you talk to the woman like that&quot;?.<br>this society treats women like the retarded kid in class. they can never do no wrong , and they are never reponsible for their actions, so therefore they should be left alone NO MATTER what they do. <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23gottalovedoublestandards">#gottalovedoublestandards</a>
what an insult... your a moron!!!!😕
The 2 DB&#39;s needa shut the hell up!
Is no one else going to comment that he risked his life over a bucket hat?
Chris Rock - &quot; That tiger didn&#39;t go crazy,...THAT TIGER WENT TIGER!&quot;
Holy crap
It would seem to me that there is more than one moron in this piece.
hello there,  it&#39;s really interesting. impartial expansion what do you think, guyt? 11
I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not American. 
I wonder who are the real animals here?
I think what he&#39;s trying to say, and please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, is that the woman is a moron.
... oh white people. overreacting for no reason.
Is Dane Cook doing background commentary?
She is correct, he is a moron !!!
The fat guy is just jealous that he can&#39;t jump a fence.
clickbait bs, he was never in danger
live here....fickin idiot
I think she was trying to get a hat or stuffed animal they dropped? she needed to be called a moron a hundred times. just go to the gift shop and get another one.
Seriously, the guy calling her a moron was worse than her jumping into the pit, you can see she wasn&#39;t in danger. Wow.
All this time that Cat was waiting on her to get back in the cage with him .
how do you comment
the unsung heros...
Here is a prime example of the rare reactioner, this is a jinx breed, trying to get his bucket hat back
I would&#39;ve done it for a 20
Darwin Award runner up.
wait so the people watching him are angry at him bc their innocent kids might have watched him being eaten, not bc they were worried for his safety.. humanity is gross. even the tiger couldn&#39;t figure what their deal was..
Give these big fat asses to the tiger, for the example.
i get pissed off when people mistake australians for english people im starting to think americans and canadians have it worse though
That tiger really wanted her. Still focused directly on her at :55
They&#39;re both morons.
Come on guys, everybody knows that&#39;s not how Canadians talk. The only logical explanation is that those were obviously American tourists from America visiting the Toronto Zoo.
whats the big deal? there is a fence. Wish there had not have been a fence...video would have been much more exciting. <br>wow...moron screaming guy made all the kids WAY more upset! kick him in the nuts &amp; get it over with.
hats off to this guy
that fat guys an ass and a moron
Is it just me or is it obvious she didn&#39;t jump any fences or enter the tiger enclosure?
I would have screamed at those arguing people and made them seperate
Be funny if she couldn&#39;t get out!
Dam cityits
Holy fuck that guy called someone a moron in Canada!?!? Gee wiz did they execute him yet for hate speech!?
nice clickbait, see the person get mauled only available in supply drops XD
he&#39;s right, she is an idiot. <br>She caused unnecessary stress towards the tiger for a hat.. a HAT
There are people who just cant mind there fucking busniss
Must be a TF2 player.
There another fking fence theres no way the tiger can get to her. Bad example yes, moron no
Wafflepawn?
Hey Jared is it fine with you if we steal this video and give no credit? Don&#39;t worry we will claim this as ours and get all the attention. Any money we make off stealing your video will go into our pockets. Thanks.
Running through the 6 with some tigers.
The example of an idiot.
There&#39;s 2 fences there, if the tiger was able to jump over that first one then it would&#39;ve easily passed that second one and that wouldn&#39;t be safe at all. I think someone was just a bit angry and had to take it out on someone. If someone thinks their hat is worth going 6 feet away from a tiger than let them.
Difference between a canadian and american<br><br>canadian is the fat bearded guy ridin on top of a moose / bacon<br><br>american is the fat bearded guy ridin on top of a harley / hamburger<br><br>fat
She was def a moron for jumping the fence wtf she was begging to be tiger poo that day
I thought Canadians were more polite than this...
flat slob annoying as hell
Feel sorry for that tiger! It looked petrified.
Stupid good Samaritans. I wanted blood
Enough internet for today..
I like how people are yelling at the jumper for &quot;endangering the kids, setting a bad example&quot; etc but the only reason the kids are crying is because the people are yelling...
I would have cheered her on - not because it was smart - but because of the sheer entertainment value.  If the tiger could get out... it would have a long time ago
what were you all hoping to see here? a gore film? haha, over 2 million dumb fucks thought so.
haha look at the triggered fatties... stfu, just coz your shook doesnt mean you need to act out a drama scene smh
Hey Jared! Crazy video. Would you care to share with us? We&#39;d give you proper on-screen credit!
Is that only a 8 foot fence over there? Don&#39;t you think a tiger can jump twice its height, then climb the rest of the way if it&#39;s desperate?
So what would have happened if the tigers handler got mauled or killed because the animal was aggravated that night when they went to transfer it into its sleeping quarters or something. It would have taken 5 minutes to get a zoo staff to come get the hat safely for her then there wouldn&#39;t have been a problem. The women is a moron and set a bad example for the children present.
This video is full shits!<br>Once a man can come out secondary land wall it means that and tigers would not be a problem!  From this means that only the first metal fence stops the animal!<br>Why then people screaming!
Meanwhile... the poor little baby in the stroller is like, &#39;SHUT THE FUCK UP&#39;, your yelling in my ear!
white people lol
The public should be kept much further away. I feel sorry for the tigers having to look at these people all day.
Expecting a mauling... get 2 fat bald guys bawling.
Is &quot;moron&quot; the worst word you can say in Canada? You guys are way to nice.
luffy needs to chill
I don&#39;t remember seeing this part in the new jungle book.
PCtards acting concerned for a Wild Animal in a ZOO. Hilarious.
To be fair though that hat does look good on her
Canadians are pretty dumb for arguing over this
Go Big man!!!!
Natural selection didn&#39;t work this time... ☹
Hey! You&#39;re a moron
Tigers says &quot;You mean I don&#39;t get meat?&quot;
Pfffft.  I did that when I was 6 years old during a field trip.  No joke.
lol why soo Madd
Lady deserves all the respect.
Darwin where are you?
Atleast they got the hat!
Now a $10 hat would make more sense
How did the camera pick up the sound all the way from there?
Safe to say a &quot;role model&quot; for her children yelling at someone for doing something brave is more dangerous than jumping a tiger fence
NO IMA MORON
Meanwhile, the baby is having a fuckin&#39; seizure...
lol fat people
lol fat people
This was lame. can&#39;t even hear the argument that took place after the &quot;gate jumping&quot;. He safely retreated his hat, no harm done.
Did someone keep count of the guy saying &quot;you&#39;re a moron&quot;??
2 moron guys... Hate this kinds of people
That guy is a moron
Anyone who visits animal prisons is a moron
Why didn´t the tiger jump? It seems not really high and he seemed so exited! But I mean, if I had such a really cool cap, I would certainly fight a stupid tiger over it :-D
I believe there was a fence separating woman from tiger.  What&#39;s all the fuss about?
Classic Toronto.
We need tiger pits on the sidewalk with signs saying danger don&#39;t go in, that should cull some idiots from the gene pool.
Haha some people love making a scene
Serious question - what&#39;s the point of that fence? If a human can easily jump it, surely the tiger can jump it too.
did that lady say she was half black ? in what world maybe by a percent of 1/50th.
tigers like what da hell is going on up there.
Don&#39;t see what the big deal is. Wasn&#39;t even in the cage.
MUPPET
meanwhile at the Lions cage...
worth it
I hope she got the boot...
Seriously, why not ask one of the hundred zoo attendants and they would have all avoided the situation.<br>Moron Eh, would have gotten her hat back and not been almost mauled by a tiger.<br>Moron B, would have not have looked like a moron by calling a moron a moron a moronically moronic amount of times like a moron.<br><br>Both bad examples of humanity.
Ok what is everyone bitching about!
I feel for the tiger.
He a real nigga
Tiger just wanted a free hat
That&#39;s more like an employee only zone.. thus not dangerous but stilll.. he shouldn&#39;t have been there..
Darwin awards baby just let it happen
Pity that second fence was there. She honestly deserved to be eaten for her stupidity. The kids would have gotten a real show then watching the tiger rip her to shreds while she screamed bloody murder.
Stupid bitch!
nobody noticed, there was no fence .. she just dropped down from the walkway haha
The lady in white  yelling has big boobs. She fighting with the gay couple , the 2 men . I am woman hear me roar.!!!
What is that guy talking about? That guys I hero he just saved that hats life he deserves a medal hat lives matter people!!!
dane cook yelling in the background
Certainly is brain-defective going in there at all.
He was <b>that</b> close to a Darwin award.
The guy kept saying &quot;do you think that&#39;s fair?&quot; because she went in to get the hat, um do you think it&#39;s fair that these wild animals are in this cage and not in their natural habitat???
This is why aliens don&#39;t have contact with us...
&quot;I&#39;m half black!&quot;<br>...........ok<br>What was the relevance to the conversation lol.
uh, she was never in the pen with the tiger
How many people were rooting for the tiger?
That tiger sure is hungry......
omg if the guy felt like the hat is worth jumping in then he should do it
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s more wild, the tiger or angry Canadians
U wanna know something here something amazing?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Read the capital words 😉✌
Why is it that people 250lb+ feel it is their duty to push morality on others. If that guy called me a moron I would tell him that he is fat and mention how we all have our struggles.
Fucking ediot I hope none of the kids that are there do that.
Good grief that tiger is eager. These creatures want to hunt, not have chunks of meat thrown at them every day. They&#39;re eager for something to pounce on and rip apart.
I&#39;m half black. WILD CARD
To the guy who said &quot;your a moron&quot; stfu.
I usually see the tigers bored and lazy.<br>But this tiger wanted to tear that woman up.
The most Canadian insult..
&quot;You&#39;re a moron keep walking&quot;<br>&quot;You&#39;re a moron&quot;<br>&quot;YOU are a moron&quot;<br>&quot;You&#39;re a moron&quot;<br>&quot;And you&#39;re a moron&quot;<br>&quot;You taught these children, that you&#39;re a moron&quot;
The tiger is just laughing at the human race there
For a fucking hat? She should have been sacrificed.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=54">0:54</a> Meanwhile the tiger is thinking, &quot;who you calling moron?&quot;
That rare +10 hat.
&quot;You&#39;re a moron&quot;<br>&quot;You&#39;re a moron&quot;<br>&quot;You&#39;re a moron&quot;<br>&quot;You&#39;re a moron&quot;<br>&quot;You&#39;re a fucking moron.&quot;<br><br>Bruh, shut up.
Wish she would&#39;ve been grabbed by the tiger, a case where natural selection needed to take place for sure. I mean how hard is it to just ask a worker to retrieved it safely?
I&#39;m confused there was a fence preventing him from being attacked from the tiger so what&#39;s wrong? People that start a scene are the morons how is yelling going to accomplish anything. There are kids? Bro you having a screaming match is probably a worse example because people engage with people more than they do with animals
Hello,<br><br>CBS News is interested in using this video on our broadcast and online afterwards. Is that ok? We will of course credit you.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Nick
&quot;You&#39;re a moron. You&#39;re a stupid person.&quot;<br><br>Would be so much better in DJ Khaled&#39;s voice.
Who cares???? there&#39;s no way the tiger could have got him!!!!!!
Awww, she lived. :(
What&#39;s the problem here?  They didn&#39;t climb over the barbed wire into the enclosure where the tiger actually is just over the first fence that stops morons from feeding the tiger(s) and losing tasty fingers.
Those poor kids having parents like that lol
that&#39;s a serious off fence
There was a fence there soo...
Still very dangerous 😰
Was he picking something up he dropped?
The tiger felt sorry to have caused all the feud.
He&#39;s a Moron.
You&#39;re a moron
OMG I LIVE IN TORONTO😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
That lady acted on impulse. Reflexively, without thinking. It happens. At that moment, her hat was all that she cared about. Its called an accident. She is lucky the Zoo had barriers to keep the tiger away, otherwise we would have been watching her devoured alive like the Indian was a couple of years ago in an Indian Zoo. The Toronto Zoo authorities need to make it impossible for people to commit suicide by jumping into a Tiger&#39;s grip. If such an accident happens, the Zoo should be shut down until the human is safe. <br>And for those shouting &quot;moron, moron&quot; in the clip, they obviously are supermen who have never made a mistake in their lives.
I would feel more safe with the tiger then the roaring, fat guy. ;)
In the end, they both shake their hands and went to pub, to have some pint and watch hockey. this is Canada. Also nice camera!
Why are they nagging him it&#39;s his life <br><br>Hat man ???-2016
He&#39;s right -- she is a moron.
This is fake, Canadians don&#39;t get mad at each other!<br><br><br><br><br>Lol I&#39;m joking I&#39;m Canadian and if someone annoys me I tell them to fuck off 😂
i dont give a shit about the kids and whether the woman set a good example for them? who cares! sheeeit think about the damn tiger that wouldve been the most fun he had all day in that prison
this is why tigers need to be in the wild.. they aint got no time for these white people shenanigans!!
was another fence weak video
that poor tiger... always pacing in the same spot.
LOL us camadians sure know how to threaten each other.... &quot;youre a moron.&quot; &quot;no youre a moron!&quot; XD
Tiger: 0<br>People: -2<br>Hat: 1
I mean we don&#39;t really know how important this hat was to the woman. I know if I lost one particular hat that I have this strange attachment to I would risk my life for it.
Clearly, she&#39;s a moron.
I love this reboot of &#39;Me at the zoo&#39;!
jumped near wild cat for a hat?  quite a hat trick / those guys gay enough to be pushing a stroller &amp; using foul language @ a female.  gay for sure!
awww why did they recording stop?? I needed to see more of the arguing!
People are saying its a girl.... Bruh y&#39;all need glasses it&#39;s a guy
must have been a slow news day
&quot;you&#39;re a moron how dare you do that in front of the children&quot;  he says in front of the children.  hypocrite
we all know the victim is the tiger ... its hungry and the meal ran away
all i could think was &quot;DEAR GOD!!!.....i hope the tiger get&#39;s a bonus meal&quot;.....glad she got her 4$ hat back.....kids probably have the same stupid genes....what a shame.
Stupid ppl should be eaten... Stops them from breeding.
That guy that jumped in was a moron and a horrible example .
Oh that tiger wants to get her soooo bad!  LOL.  Poor kitty missed some fun.
That woman is so fucking stupid, it actually blows my mind. Forget the hat. You had one rule to follow. One. Don&#39;t jump a fence to an enclosure!
Buddy with loud voice is more of a git than original git.
Oh great! Now the rest of the world will think we Canadians are all morons.
probably an American visiting Canada 😒😂😂
stupid fuckturd, yet, alive :(
White people..
Toronto fur lyf!
Most uneventful video ever! Should change the title to &quot;Man calls person moron at zoo&quot;
i want my maple leafs hat back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
who the fuck cares?? that fat guy needs to chill
Im not sure but he might be a moron
Welcome to Canada
I think the wild animals are on the outside of the enclosure on this one
Drama at the zoo?  And it was after what had happened.  Geez.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freethetigers">#FreeTheTigers</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=57">0:57</a>: The tiger looking up at her and the dude arguing like.. I wish one of y&#39;all would.
OMG, he  basically trespassed into the private property of someone who is a thousand times more possessive of his property than any person would ever become.  They view that enclosure like it&#39;s a unforgivable act to even think about walking on mr tigers lawn.  And iI am going to laugh at all the people who think humans are the only animals who take ownership of the land they live on.
People these days...
first off why is everyone mad at him he&#39;s a G. He drop his hat looked at the tiger and said fuck it. If anything this dude is my hero.
i want to know what happened after
Poor tiger stuck in captivity for peoples entertainment fuck zoos.
That&#39;s what we call PRIORITIES....
Who ever was calling here a moron over and over was right.    What a dumb ass moron.<br>The zoo officials here aught to press charges and have that fool pay a fine and be glad it&#39;s only a fine and that cat couldn&#39;t get a hold of her.<br>How stupid can you be.
That was...wow. I have to say your camera has very good quality and sound. It picked upped the conversation from a good distance. What camera were you using?
why was that fat guy and his ginger friend yelling at the lady
that is the dumbest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. that tiger was ready to eat her alive and she goes for...a HAT.
This video is very offensive to all the morons out there
all i heard was moron
I&#39;ve never herd such rude Canadians
didnt moe moe already upload this?
Yo this reminds of the Tiger bit that Katt Williams performed a while back....<br><br>Waiiiiit for it.... Waiiiiit for it .... MAUL HIM!<br><br><br>but seriously. You&#39;re a moron.
What a moron
Props to this amazing video quality though :)
Damn daniel
What an IDIOT he. could&#39;ve DIED AND WOULD BE CALLED THE IDIOT WHO JUMPER OBER THE TIGER CAGE IN THE TORONTO ZOO AND DIED WHAT AN IDIOT I DON&#39;T CARE IF THE GUY READS THIS COMMENT IF HE COMES FOR ME HE&#39;LL BE ARRESTED FOR BREAKING IN TO A FAMILY&#39;S HOUSE AND FOR ATTACKING A INNOCENT CCCCHHHHIIIILLLLDDDD THAT RIGHT IM A KID SUPLEX CITY
okay either I have really bad hearing or she said &quot; I&#39;m half black&quot;
In her defense,it was probably her favorite Hat.
She could have got the beautiful TIGER killed... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stupid">#Stupid</a>
I can&#39;t believe that she jumped out of the relative safety of the Tiger Cage just to be assaulted verbally by two ugly bearded bozos with a baby stroller.That was truly scary.
lol, if the tiger got out of his cage then everyone on the walkway would be in danger, this video is a moron
everybody calm down
Fat tubby custard speaks his tiny abusive mind to woman physically able enough to retrieve hat next to tigers cage.
I think we should not put animals in zoos. It&#39;s like kidnapping people and putting them in cages. I mean like Animals don&#39;t put humans in cages. Seaworld or whatever the fuck it&#39;s called they fucken do so many bad stuff to their whales.
what&#39;s was the guys problem tho lmao
Was there a moron involved? Not quite sure... :P
Who are these idiots defending this woman?
The hat probably said &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;
That cat was completely trapped behind that fence the whole time. Whats the difference if you are 1 foot away if everyone else is 10 feet away? Its not like he was sticking hands through the fence or something… probably more dangerous walking around the city at night, actually, or driving down a major highway in winter.
The guy just wanted to have his hat. You guys don&#39;t know him. Maybe this hat was important for him. You guys don&#39;t know. So the guy who is calling him a moron is himself a moron because he don&#39;t event know about this person, and calls him a moron. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Hum... ah yes I almost forgot: If there are some grammar faults may you excuse me for this. English isn&#39;t my langage
parallax well said
When Americans visit Canada...
I know that was agaisnt the rules but why is the fat guy so angry? Lol
And they&#39;re mad because she actually has more balls than them.   “You&#39;re a bad example to everyone else’s kids” those men not only acted like but sounded like women. themselves
Stupid is as stupid does
In the end, the most civilized person is the tiger. Shame to be human sometimes :(
They later apologized to each other
I agree that he&#39;s a Moran thear wer children&#39;s that wer watching and they might learn from him and do it because he survived . (the child :《so he survived so I&#39;m a survivre 》)
As heated as a Canadian argument gets :D
Big Dummy!
I read the title and thought it said &quot;tiger jumping fence to get a person&#39;s hat in Toronto Zoo xD&quot;
you taught these children you are a moron
Why the lady in white t-shirt keeps shouting &quot;I&#39;m half blonde, I&#39;m half blonde&quot;?
Can some of you help me reach my 1 million subscriber goal? That&#39;d be so cool! I&#39;m almost there too!
You&#39;re all morons that showed up to watch majestic creatures enslaved in a zoo.
Moron count:38
misleading title, waste of 2 minutes, moving on..
The real crime is the Tiger being trapped in a cage.
what an idiot. I hope he gets arrested and fined.
It&#39;s not like the tiger could actually harm the person.
Classy people lol
how did her hat get over the fence?
Who&#39;s the real animal?
What&#39;s going on why is there yelling why do other people care if he jumped a fence to get his hat wtf
Maniac! THIS PERSON SHOULD BE ARRESTED AND CHARGED!
I can&#39;t help but thank the person who filmed this. It&#39;s shot in landscape and isn&#39;t shaking like hell.
If it was a Tilley hat, it could have gone through an elephant and emerged as a wearable hat after cleaning off the fecal matter.
Thumbs up if you&#39;re dissapointed the tiger didn&#39;t eat one of them.
Let the tiger roam back in the wild, it looks hungry and it&#39;s instincts is clearly active!
I think I&#39;d prefer the tiger&#39;s company to that apeshit family&#39;s.
Im sorry .. did i miss something ? What did the guy do wrong exactly?
human... that&#39;s all i can say...
What a big vocabulary! moron, moron, moron!
Where was security?   watching Cameras or on a coffee break at Tim&#39;s? <br>Instead,  at least there was a protective fence between the idiot moron and the tiger.<br>Likely there to protect the tiger from idiot morons.  <br>I&#39;m suspecting an idiot moron canadian rib lunch would cause too much indigestion.<br>People are basically morons.   <br>I&#39;m ready to leave now please.
I expected to see someone jump into the actual cage...
The guy getting the hat was definitely Canadian but the yelling creatures were definitely not. They didn&#39;t even say thank you!
I don&#39;t get it, why did they cause a scene afterwards with the whole &quot;moron&quot; shouting match?
so dum
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23moron">#moron</a>
The hardest question ever- who is the moron...?
The worst thing about all of this is no one seems to care how agitated that stupid move made the tiger. Having worked at a zoo I know that any change in an animals &quot;average&quot; day can greatly upset them causing emotional and physical problems.
gays vs lesbians?
let me get this straight soo zoos take animals minding their business kidnap them then put them on display 4 humans. i can respect some zoos becuz some RESCUE animals and later free them. people who own zoos are morons and set a bad example
lol there are children, so let me try to cause a scene.
its okay, she&#39;s half black
Everything seems reasonable enough, except the tiger will set people straight.
This is a daughter, probably around 12 years of age, what seems to be the mother and other sibling present, doing what 12 year olds do. However the ball cap fell where it did, kids run onto the road after soccer balls. They place greater importance on inanimate, replaceable objects than personal safety, which sometimes requires a terrifying brush with serious injury or death to drive the lesson home. The steel mesh in the video, thankfully not recorded with a hideous Iphone, is the only barrier separating that Sumatran Tiger from the outside. The daughter or niece or whoever was in no greater danger than anyone else, other than their proximity angered a tiger already very unhappy about their captive situation. <br><br>The chubby guy blasting/lecturing the mother (presumed), repeatedly calling a moron, is oblivious that he&#39;s one of a great many adult fools there.  The 12 year old didn&#39;t abduct and put that tiger in this zoo. Adults did. The 12 year old would never know such a zoo existed or get to without adults to inform at some point of age, transport over and purchase a gate ticket, likely purchasing the errant ball cap. The chubby guy is directing their shocked, angered disbelief onto the woman who is also shocked by the outburst, when that incredibly powerful and wholly lethal tiger is there because adults like him are the fools that financially sustain the arrogant absurdity of the zoo industry.  <br><br>These animals are not meant to be caged or enclosed or artificially fed. They should be in their natural habitat, proffered a very wide berth to hunt, never bothered, protected from poachers.
That must have been one hell of a nice hat..
Did anybody notice there are more white people at the Toronto Zoo than at a U.S. Klan rally?
Farid al atrach
Didn&#39;t really jump it considering there was a complete it was the only fence there
My defence those are Americans
THE ABSOLUTE MADMAN.
Too bad the Tiger couldn&#39;t escape to shut all of them &quot;morons&quot; up.
That&#39;s why animals are smarter than humans
stupid cow
What an absolute fool.  I agree with the man, she&#39;s setting a really poor example for all the children there.  He shouldn&#39;t have lost his cool to that degree, but he was right.
You can&#39;t fix stupid, no matter how many times you tell someone they&#39;re a moron.<br><br>I mean... it&#39;s not like zookeepers had access to that area and could safely retrieve the hat.... Oh, wait.
That FAT A$$, ZZ TOP Wannabe needs to STFU.  Yes it was stupid to grab a hat from the tiger cage, but if the dude gets mauled he gets mauled.  ZZ TOP escalated the situation for no other reason than to just to be an ARS and make a scene.  O Canada!!!
I feel like a moron for watching this.  I lost out like the tiger.  Seriously thankfully she wasn&#39;t killed.  She should thank the zoo for putting in a 2nd fence for morons her like
Women make the best survival decisions that&#39;s why they run the world ... oh wait
you both are fucken moron. Even bigger moron who uploaded this video .Fuck you all .Enjoy zoo
That persons hat should&#39;ve been a little more on.
That guys wants to fuck that tiger.
moron
we all should learn from this Canadians- total stupidity.  She needs a new brain.
I see two drama queens who are trying to start some shit up. There is clearly a fence between the tiger and the outside environment. If a person could hike up that wall, don&#39;t you think a tiger wouldn&#39;t have been able to?
person is a lesbian
big mouths
I&#39;ve been here
Welcome to Canada, my friends...
Ok, so ya the choice to jump the fence was a brilliant one without question and is suitable for a comment or two, BUT compared to the amount of kids who could hear fat ass yelling &quot;you are an f-bomb moron&quot; compared to the children who could actually see her jump the fence I&#39;m pretty sure he touched so many more little lives with his stellar personality
and this freakin fat woman tryin to defend the moron...should&#39;ve bitch slapped her...
I love the fat righteous losers acting like this is some how their problem.
To the people freaking on the lady that jumped the fence and calling her names... Guess what? You&#39;re no better than her if not worse. Setting set a horrible example to the children aroun you, act like an adult! Name calling and yelling when upset is what children do as they have little to no coping skills when young.
Well who&#39;s more of a moron?
It&#39;s that kind of stupidity that makes me with that more people would get mauled by tigers.
I love how angry Torontonians constantly are.
There should be a button that people can press if a person jumped in between the fences to release the tiger! :)
who are the real animals?
morons like this one deserve to be eaten by lovely tigers
i feel like i just got rick  rolled
Can&#39;t blame her. I would have done the same thing
World star
Proof positive that the virus of supreme stupidity/mental defeciency has spread up North. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23idiocracy">#Idiocracy</a>
great video quality though
a lot of people in the comments argue for emotional stress done to the tiger!!! what? why? he is a tiger, a walking killing machine!! not a pussy!!! for the first time in his life he finally gets some excitement, don&#39;t take it away from him!!! let him have fun!!!
so, what seems to be the problem? there was a fence in between the tiger and the person. the only thing he jumped over was the rail of the elevated platform\bridge!!! why all of the a sudden the guy with a beard lost it? he looks like a World of Warcraft basement dweller, who for the first time in a decade came out into the wild!!! lol
So she didn&#39;t just in the cage at all and was in fucking 0 danger? Why the fuck is this in the news....
Why couldn&#39;t she just ask a worker with access to get it?!
While I definitely agree that what the woman did was stupid, irresponsible, and a bad example for the children in the vicinity, I&#39;m pretty sure the constant barrage of &quot;you&#39;re a moron&quot; wasn&#39;t the greatest example of intelligence and virtue, either.
I would have been said something as well, but much more articulate. Maybe.. big, stupid face moron!
IT WAS A CHICK YOU JUMPED IN THERE NOT A MAN. Why is that fat guy trying to act concerned and then trying to attack the person who jumped in like that fat fuck was in any danger lol Yes the person who jumped in is a moron but there was another line of fence in front of him HE ACTUALLY COULD HAVE STAYED THERE TRUTHFULLY AND THE TIGER WOULD HAVE NOT EVEN GOT CLOSE. This gay couple and/or two guys with a baby are just easily offended by anything and seek attention to victimize themselves even though this event had nothing to do with them they just feel the need to step in and be apart of it. I was hoping to see that fuck fuck get punched. THAT FAT FUCK ACTED LIKE HE WAS GONNA PUNCH THE WOMAN WHO JUMPED IN.
Something is telling me that man&#39;s a <b>moron</b>.
VLOG AND TUTORIAL CHANNEL HERE PLEASE CHECK IT OUT AND SUBSRIBE IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO ME 😊
Those fat guys yelling at the woman are also setting a bad example for little kids. And look how fat they are. That&#39;s a horrible example they are setting for their own kids.
What an incredibly moronic thing to do.
Poor tigers.. have to listen that mindless yelling there. Open the gates and bring on the wild thing. Majestic creatures they are and should be treated likewise.
&quot;You&#39;re a moron<br>Keep walking<br>You know the fact that you&#39;re a moron?<br>You&#39;re a moron<br>You&#39;re a moron<br>And you taught these children that you&#39;re a moron&quot;<br>Anyone else imagining this made into a musical remix?
I wish they would outlaw big animals from zoos all together. They just don&#39;t belong there. Make some robotic animals that people can touch and get close up to. It would still draw the same amount of people without anyone getting hurt.
everyone&#39;s a moron in this video.
I&#39;ve been to the Toronto zoo before. That cage is totally enclosed. The part the guy jumped into is still outside of the cage. I don&#39;t know why people like to start drama.
There was still a fence separating them, why the fuck is this viral?
There are signs at the zoo informing people that staff has equipment to safely retrieve dropped items.  So she is double the moron, because apparently she can&#39;t read, either.
1000nd like
&quot;You&#39;re a bad example in front of these kids.&quot; <br><b>continues to insult a complete stranger</b>
She was a moron. She was just like the typical woman of today.....entitled feminist with a weak husband and a fat loud mouth friend. her husband is so weak that he does not defend his wife, allows her to do something so stupid and if it was that important, why did he not jump in instead. we now see who wears the pants and who carries the daddy do list everyday.
why is that woman getting confrontational with 2 men? I&#39;m not about to get into Mike Tyson&#39;s face, she needs to back off
I nearly had to do that for a stupid school assignment
nobody got hurt whats the big deal
&#39;Face to face&#39; There&#39;s a freaking fence between them -_-
Ironic, Jungle Book premiered this weekend.
what a tease
He did not jumped the tiger fence! He jumped the fence before the tiger fence.
He actually deserved a good mauling and at the very least he should be prosecuted.
Was hoping for the tiger to help rid of idiots that stain the gene pool.  Almost won a Darwin Award...may be up for an Honorable Mention?
The epitome of stupidity...
And in an alternate universe, a tiger is calling another tiger a moron for jumping into a human cage to get a lost hat.
In the aftermath, the tiger paces and glares at the crowd, thinking: which other hat-wearing moron up there is gonna try to be my lunch next?
Nothing to say but.... WHAT A FRIGGIN MORON!!
Middle aged white people will find any excuse to be mad I swear.
2 videos in 1.
the fat fuck is just sad that he could not do that. teach your children to think for themselves and not just follow rules blindly.
Everyone who watches imprisoned animals is a moron.
too bad  he did&#39;t eat her
That must be a very expensive hat.
Another  reason why Zoos  should NOT exist!!<br>Stupid, Ignorant, Arrogant humans!<br>You could have simply brought the matter to zoo employees attention, and they could have got your hat for you.<br>Hopefully you never had children!!!
молодец. Это по-нашему)
Oshawa visits the zoo
Life changing.
THE TOTAL IQ OF EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS FRACAS IS THAT OF A DOOR KNOB !!!!!!!!! (INCLUDING THE TIGER&#39;S)
I was really hoping we were going to see this BIMBO getting mauled to death.  Dang!  Then they wonder why FEMALES are created SECOND Best!  Bimbo!
&quot;I&#39;m half black.&quot;<br><br>That don&#39;t mean shit moron!
What a shity, tiny enclosure!... It doesn&#39;t even respect the tiger&#39;s natural habitat, which is the forest... Pour animal stuck in a hole with people staring down at him all day long...
I want that family on a TLC reality show next fall. It should be called.   Tiger Trouble.
Prob the most action that tiger&#39;s had in a while!!
what a stupid ass - must be a pink-one! Deserve to be tiger lunch  ...... can anyone say that the &quot;civilized&quot; folk are MORONS!
Lol.. tiger is frustrated
I wish I had a Dollar for everytime I heard Moron.
It was Pi Patel, he thought that was Richard Parker and wanted to get closure.
Hello, I am with KTLA Channel 5 News in Los Angeles. We would like permission to use your video in our broadcasts/web. We can give you credit too!
with high expectations from the video title , this was utterly disappointing
That &quot; fat &quot; dude should eat that woman , and woman in white who was so loud made all kids cry there.
&quot;she jumped into a Tiger cage, are you kidding me?!&quot;<br><br>that&#39;s a good enough argument for me.
There was a fence between them, really Its not like it could get to her. Whats the big deal. That guy bitching needs to mind his own business.
Fucking snitch
It was a woman, that explains the struggled delay lifting herself out lol
The question is why did you stop taking the video!?
go eat a hotdog and relax
and.... no one died that day.. but he is a bit of a moron
I thought the oompaloompa in the white shirt was going to start stomping her feet and screaming.  What a child. <br><br>Those guys are beauties. Much respect to both of then for sticking up for whats right.
That moment you wish nature took it&#39;s course.
What upsets me is the stress she put on the tiger and if it had hurt her, in anyway, they would have immediately put it down. People are so freaking self centered and stupid!!
Had she gotten attacked by the tiger, what are the odds that she would have sued the zoo?
The tiger is thinking, &quot;just look at these animals.&quot;
That poor beautiful tiger who should be out in the wild somewhere. The humans are all a&amp;&amp;holes
That nagging fat pig with the big mouth is the bad example.
If she was in the tiger cage, how come the tiger didn&#39;t get her?  Oh yeah, cuz it&#39;s obvious that she jumped into the safety zone between the cage and the path.  Yeah, it&#39;s not the brightest thing to do, but then again, it&#39;s obvious that the tiger couldn&#39;t get to her.... Cuz it definitely would have if it could.  What&#39;s funny is how crazy the other people got over it.  It&#39;s not like she tossed them down there or something.  People need to chill the fuck out.
When will white people stop trying to be &quot;the authoritative world Cop&quot; those guys are annoying.<br>sheeeesh if the woman wanted to be eatin by a tiger so be it.
That&#39;s great, film your Canadian stupidity, &quot;The Right Way&quot;
The real problem is why is this animal being caged up for his life just so humans can have some sort of amazement, the real &quot;morons&quot; here the are people you go to these zoos to see animals in captivity. Imagine if that was a human in that cage how would you all feel?
Oh, the irony in this video is amazing. The supposedly &#39;evolved&#39; human beings yelling and swearing at each other are free to roam the earth and annoy everyone, while the beautiful, majestic tiger who keeps to itself spends it&#39;s life locked in a cage.
Those men argue like little children
Please give the tiger some peace
Take a drink everytime the guy says &quot;Moron&quot; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23drinkinggame">#drinkinggame</a>
ive started to really dislike zoos.  they don&#39;t benefit the animals. sanctuaries with little or no public viewing are the way to go.
The tiger was the only one in this video who was behaving properly.
you&#39;re a fucking moron
title lies.
why people are that angry at her ?
Ultimate click bait, I thought they&#39;d jumped the fence into the actual den.
So I guess these two douche bags yelling at the woman in front of her kids make them better ?
white ppl so scared
Future Darwin award recipient...
fucking selfish idiot. Breaking public rule just for her own small hat.
Though I also think this was a very stupid thing to do, especially when you can see how much it aggravates the Tiger...I think the guy calling her a &quot;fucking moron&quot; and saying that she&#39;s a &quot;bad example to all the children there&quot; is rather hypocritical....
over a million views and only 900 likes? weird.
That tiger was like I wish you would biatch
agreed man...
Doesn&#39;t calling another person a moron a couple hundred times in front of kids make you a moron and a bad example to kids lol just saying......
There is nothing worst than stupid screaming woman...
Whats funny is she was just getting her kids toy, I would do the same thing if my kid dropped her toy and its none of that fat bastards business and if he is really concerned about setting a &quot;good example&quot; for his kids he probably shouldn&#39;t be calling another parent a moron and blowing the whole situation out of proportion, what he should have done was look at his own kid and tell them, See what that women is doing? thats not safe so dont do stuff like that. and the whole thing woulda been handled the right way (not like your kid isnt gonna grow up to be a little shit head anyways, we are all little shit heads at some point in life and most cant out grow it, Like this man in this video who just cant  mind his own business like an adult) but of course people cant wait to butt their noses into everything and fight about it,  like your a grown man get over it and act your age...... Rant over :)
The person in the red shirt is a guy.  He shouldn&#39;t have jumped down but he wasnt in the cage.  The report I heard on the radio made it sound like he was in the cage with the tiger.  Typical media report making it sound like something it wasnt.
Stupid overreacting people. She jumped down to retrieve her cap, so? There&#39;s a fence there.
For moron this story......ahh fuck.
He dropped his hat what&#39;s the big deal
I saw you on Breakfast Television for this exact story :)
What a completely stupid woman..!!!
&quot;She is an exemplary example of a sophisticated human, please allow her to lead by example,&quot;<br>-The Tiger, probably
the most stupid ever in whole world!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=27">0:27</a>  &quot;Your a fucking moron&quot; -- pretty much sums it up
Can you remove jumping from the title I legit though it jumped out the fence but NOPE. Dreams crushed :( th
The tiger at the end is like fight fight fight!
Hi Jared, I&#39;m from The Telegraph. Scary video. Would it be possible for us to use your video in an article that we are writing? My email is olivia.bolton@telegraph.co.uk if you&#39;d like to get in touch. Best, O
Was she yelling &quot;i&#39;m half black&quot;???
Canadians fight too? the only Canadians I know are from &quot;just for laugh&quot;
&quot;you&#39;re a moron, because you&#39;re a moron, and you&#39;re a moron, and you just taught these kids that you&#39;re a moron!&quot; its times like these i&#39;m proud to be Canadian XD
After this video the two guys apologized and hugged it out
Uh we got a stupid bitch here.
Can we nominate her for a Darwin?
it wasnt even a cool hat.
&quot;ARE YOU CRAZY? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!?&quot;
Hi Jared, Wondering if we can have permission to broadcast/post this video on KTVU FOX 2?
wtf.. the white lady is on the moron&#39;s side.. see guys if I jumped into the fence my asians parents would just slap and beat my face in public or they would probably throw me into the tiger&#39;s mouth
I dont get what happened???
Can anyone please subscribe to me<br>Many many thx
Are those guys upset that the tiger didn&#39;t get the MacCrappy deal?<br> if would&#39;ve been fun to see the tiger play with its food for a bit. No?
I am sure that the 50th time that guy yelled &quot;you&#39;re a moron,&quot; it really got through to her and she realized the error of her ways.
the Real MORONS are the people who take a wild animal like a Tiger ...and put it into a Caged CELL and then charge $$ ...for others to view.   Oh what we will do for a Profit.?!?<br>Obviously if the Tiger or ANY wild animal is or has been abused ,  and cannot survive in the wild ... that is a Different Story.   But most of these animals in Zoos have Never known freedom and have been breed for this Exact reason..... the Almighty DOLLAR.   It&#39;s pretty Sad actually.
TWO MEN ENTER, ONE MAN LEAVE!  TWO MEN ENTER, ONE MAN LEAVE!
Are you okay fat man? You&#39;re not you without a Snickers bar.
That fat guy calling her a moron is right and all, but that argument was the biggest calorie burn workout he had done that whole week. Just saying.
fascinating. I wonder if she has something physically wrong with her brain, the parts that control fear and adrenaline.
I wish Tony got some free lunch there.. Dummies are Grrrrrrrrrrrrrreat!!!!!!!!!!!
It wasn&#39;t the tiger that should have been behind the cage...
Tiger be like, &quot;Can&#39;t we all just get along, morons?&quot; 😂
She was protected by a fence
did that person drop something down in the pit or wanted a closer look at the tiger
You&#39;re a moron infinity. No backsies!
I know you are but what am I?<br>I know you are but what am I?<br>I know you are but what am I?
Is true that she is a moron. Who in their right mind would go into the tiger den just to get their hat back? Luckily the tiger didn&#39;t kill or hurt that person. I don&#39;t want to see an animal being put down because of some individual stupid actions.
spoiler. there is another fence blocking person and tiger
i dont like zoos, it just makes me sad when some animal is locked up
Ape Vs Tiger
Wow . . . just . . . wow..
What a pair of dumb bitches.
Fucking hell, the real morons here are the people who still find caged wild animals entertaining.
0/10<br><br>bitch didnt get eaten
stupid fatty, let the poor boy fuck with the tiger in peace smh.
That&#39;s probably the most exciting thing that cat has experienced in a long time. I&#39;m glad it got a bit of excitement in it&#39;s life. It probably gets pretty dull having a bunch of weird humans just stare at you every day. Finally one of them did something interesting enough to watch.
Keyboard warriors in real life.
Your a moron
There&#39;s a reason there&#39;s 2 sets of fences in place and it doesn&#39;t mean you can just ignore all sensibilities just because there is a second fence. And yes she&#39;s a moron.
&quot;You&#39;re behaving badly infront of the children&quot; <br><br>proceeds to have a screaming match infront of them xD
Why did that guy jump over the fence?
The tiger is behind the fence... She only jumped down past the first barrier. Misleading title and now I&#39;m bored again.
Was hoping they&#39;d let the tiger out to wreck all those morons
She sure has a very expensive hat... Even though she wasn&#39;t in danger but it&#39;s still kinda scary. And doing that in front of young children not too sure if it&#39;s a good idea. However, calling someone/each other moron is not setting good example to children too :/
The only one in this video who isn&#39;t a moron is the tiger.
&quot;Nigga this is not a drill. Get ready Nigga. They think we bullshittin!!&quot;
And then something wonderful happened in the tiger world...
she is an idiot for sure.
-Didn&#39;t she just jump the barrier in front of the actual tiger fence? I don&#39;t believe she was in the actual tiger pen...<br>-It looks like she jumped down to the walkway zookeepers use to walk around the tiger pen...<br>-Clearly if the area a human can jump back out of was accessible to tigers, tigers would be loose all over the park, haha.<br>-Yeah, it&#39;s pretty dumb to trespass into the zookeeper/tiger area, but it&#39;s also stupid to say this person &#39;jumped&#39; into a tiger pen...<br><br>Also thanks for filming in landscape, and in HD and 60FPS to boot. Well done ;-)
&quot;I&#39;m half black, I&#39;m half black&quot;
Apparently she went down to grab a hat. Listen at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=24">0:24</a> &quot;it&#39;s like a $5 hat&quot; and watch her pick up something off the ground in the beginning...
yeah she maybe a moron but he told her at least 10 times!  he&#39;s as crazy as she is..the tiger was probably thinking the same thing.
I get why guy mad<br>kids see it <br>they might think its ok do what that person did<br>End day its just hat.
Did she really just say &quot;because I am half black&quot; ? smh @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxPpgAzd3Y&amp;t=74">1:14</a>
Over a hat??? Geez! It&#39;s not that serious.
I heard he&#39;s a moron
the person who hopped the fence should have just zit up a smoke, grab their child, and walk away
the tiger is just like &quot;this is the best human exhibit I&#39;ve seen in a long time, even comes with free arguing that doesn&#39;t stop from both parties&quot;
DID SHE DIED???
The men were more dangerous to her than the tiger. If the second woman didn&#39;t stop them, she&#39;d have had to jump back over.
She shoulda gotten mauled by the tiger and dude yelling at her.
and for the record this happened in canada...not amurica
This video should have ended with a feast of fat fucks and skinny morons for the tiger.
Why are these morons arguing about someone else being a moron?
that hat must be expensive
It&#39;s never of use to tell someone they are  a moron because either they are a moron, which they can&#39;t help, and it does no good or they are not a moron but they did something stupid, this time, but you will close them down by attacking them for being a moron.
It seems like she unintentionally faked out the tiger twice. Like the cat was expecting her to be faster.
It is a  lovely hat though, so....
