I wonder what a pit bull would do?
Jjjjjjjjj
Somebody, teach Spot to (gently) boop the snoot.
وحقدت المسنة المذبذبة حقدت 😂👌🔥

Typical cautious terrier behavior, stay out of danger range until you figure out the enemy

Dog recognizes evil
Dogs are infallible judges of character.

It&#39;s all fun and games till Spot barks back
Snowy ......

Good dog, even dogs know evil when they see it.
I cant believe that we&#39;re actually going through with this.

The dog knows and is warning humans before it&#39;s too late......
are dog would run a  mile
The dog like ong what is that I must destroy it!!!
It&#39;s not a robot. It&#39;s a remote controlled metal object with legs
The dislikes are from the dog&#39;s relatives.
These robots are creepy as hell. What’s wrong with people who make or want these?
Sweet
Il I will Never meet a robot dog I shoot it with my desert eagle  .50 caliber
Where is his head and mouth 😂😂
Virá um dia, que não vão achar graça. Vão brincando, vão...
I&#39;m quiet. Dogs will defend us from robots
That real dog&#39;s name needs to be Einstein.
Robot needs a tail to wag to show peace
Ai sht is hell on earth . Fk their agenda
Definitely not like a real dog as it didn&#39;t try to shag it&#39;s owners leg or another dog or come to that a naked woman (I&#39;ve seen the porn).
Terrible!
Scary
nice
That is so cool 😎
IMPRESSIONANTE o quanto a BÍBLIA é PERFEITA em tudo que diz. A cada avanço da ciência, mais amo e creio na Palavra de Deus, pois há mais de 2 mil anos ela vem avisando que quando estivesse próximo do fim, coisas assim seriam realidade. Louvado seja Deus pois o arrebatamento dos salvos está, de fato, muito perto. Quem ficar aqui, vai seguir sob a mão de ferro do governo único (que está vindo ai), por 7 anos (tempo total do seu governo.<br>Obrigado Jesus por ter deixado avisado sobre os sinais que precedem sua volta. Está muito perto!!!!
The robot dog needs to sniff the real dog&#39;s ass  and vice versa to establish dominance.
Lol
Horizon Zero down - Dog Edition
So funny, just wait in a few years when the future model gets orders to eliminate target!
Robodog will make you as hotdog pal..&quot; I&#39;ll be back.&quot;
This is NOT awsome.....this is shit
The dog understands that&#39;s an enemy. Humen don&#39;t. So, who is the most intelligent here, dogs or humen?🤔
Hit him with the giant frick’n laser
Where will you spend eternity? Jesus will return very soon. Heaven or hell. Be ready
Horrible machine...
🤣
Afortunadamente el perro real todavía parece más ágil, pero no será por mucho creo
Won’t be laughing when their AI are out there against the people ,,,,,,
Are you seen this type of dog in adventures of tin tin movie.
Lol surprised either don&#39;t want to sniff each other botty
So noise of machine

Put some AI into the machine and let&#39;s see what happens next
Who are you?<br>I&#39;m you, but a better version of you.<br><br>Decide whether the real dog said this or the mechanical one.
I almost thought this might be a dance off
He sees the future,and is just warning us
The part they didn&#39;t show: when the dog cocked its leg and urinated on the robot, which immediately went into melt-down.
, 😃😃😃😃😃👍👍👍👍👍

Today we are laughing. Tomorrow we will run and hide for our lives...
Good

😠👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
This reminds me of a Black Mirror episode.
That dog was the messenger, we have been warned.
Wow😄😄😄😄😄😄
😁😁
Se fossem meus vira-latas não sobraria um parafuso....kkkkkkk
🙄🤔😂😂😂
I see that shit walking by me ima shoot it
That robot is hateful
Everybody&#39;s a gangster until Robot Dog starts wagging it&#39;s tail.
Dogs know the dark forces needed to create this abomination. In the future scientists will be recognised from a young age and thrown on the scrap heap. This is after a nuclear holocaust and various out breaks of diseases created by mad scientists.
ME : THIS DOG IS SO FUNNY (MY DOG : SHUT UP HE IS MY GRAND FATHER ) ME : WTF
Beat that robot dog with a sledge hammer while you have a chance. Boston dynamics is the the home of Tenet&#39;s terminator.
That dog is probably dead. 😔 Rest in peace wiggly tail dog.
He is Lucky Robot. My pitbull would have tear him apart like a paper. 😂
The dog is smarter than we are.
John Connors future guard dog!
FUC----G AWESOME!!!!!
Knock it over and let&#39;s see it get up
This shit will kill us soon
The dog doesn&#39;t like that NWO shit he can feel it&#39;s an enemy
Ooooo. Nice 👍
Dogs are stupid
Just remember guys - when the day comes that your tyrannical government uses these against you (and they will), its nothing a heavy wet blanket cant disable.
I love it how everybody is just making a joke about this and there&#39;s people who replied some fact too seriously.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>My english sucks.
The dog is the smartest one
This dog knows this is human invention and everyone is curious to see his reaction, so it is reacting fearlessly and doing proper drama.<br><br>But even human don&#39;t know what would happen if programming gone wrong lol
We can create AI or machine brain, but it cannot work like human brain, AI can learn but can&#39;t have emotions or thoughts like humans, because nobody knows what consciousness is, a dog is conscious but not as much as humans, AI can never be conscious because we fucking don&#39;t know what that is and where it came from and how it works, yeah we can say the electric signals between neurones in our brain causes consciousness but again that doesn&#39;t define anything.
Funny but kinda creepy at the same time.
So nice video, Funny too
Everyone watch the prequel to the Matrix movies - Animatrix.  You will find out how robots wipe out humanity and take over the world as they use our bodies as food and an energy source to fuel the virtual world of the Matrix.
Good boy Fido, don&#39;t let the machine try to fool you with its cute antics.
Dogs know what it means evil.
&quot;Sputnik&quot;?<br>The corona virus &quot;vaccine&quot; maker?
Enough about the dog , that Robot is crazy
dog knew this aint a good idea 😂
That&#39;s not a dog.
You are terminated!
Dem wyt demons at again 👿
Man made vs GOD made
Nothing funny...
I see a dream<br>Where a man no longer walks his dog<br>But the dog walks the man
Stupid people who had bought this artificial electronic shit, manipulating this shit with remote control unit and just loughing at normal dog...<br>🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Just wait until robot gets an update. You will realise what a simple code can do.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg6oeazTNY&amp;t=26">0:26</a> He does the bamboozle dance
If it was my dog, he&#39;ll chew on that robot like a toy.
Robo dog: I want your job<br>Dog: starts barking
I wonder do the people developing these machines have the insight to realise where all of this can end up. Or they just don’t care. I mean the developers of the spinning Jenny couldn’t have known but there is no excuse for these people in being unaware of the damage and dangers of continually taking jobs from humans.
nice to know our money is going towards a bunch of bozos in white gowns making fake animals lmao
And soon we&#39;ll be living in the matrix
The dog definitely try to warns us 😂
Dog be like what the metal thing is that !!😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Those who thinks this is real like my comments 😂😂😂😂<br>I will say u r still in ingrowth brain
Dog vs walking suitcase
“Battle mode” 😂
Robot dog is like &quot;TERMINATE TERMINATE!&quot;
You guys: making jokes about AI and stuff.<br>The dog: Knows this is ain&#39;t no joke.
Robo dog look more like a decapitated emu
That’s a Welsh Terrier and a very smart dog! I had one!  Best dog ever!
Don&#39;t like this.  HORRIBLE FOR THE DOG.  It&#39;s stressed.  Can&#39;t the owner see that?
🐕  왈   어디가 앞이고  어디가 뒤냐?   이짐승은
Anyone else wondering who is wasting their time making weird crap like this?
&quot;Are you moving forward or backward?&quot;<br><br>Boston Robot:<br><b>&quot;Yesn&#39;t&quot;</b>
People: “ahhh” <br><br>Dog: “everyone get da fukk back”
Si le ladra es porq es extraño y no es bueno...
HOW CAN YOU CALL THAT THING A REAL DOG HAHAHA fucking horrible dog
There should be a piss mechanism
Beautiful white robot
“How dare you- imposter!”
Stupid. Robots are junk
Why the Robotic did not bark in retaliation?
Naming the Boston dynamics robot a “dog” is an insult to dogs.
Luckily he didn&#39;t want to tried make love with it.
Today I can truly say, what the fuck have humans done to the world ? <br><br>No one asked Dog&#39;s approval for this.
Our past vs our future
Literally no one:<br>Robot dog: Starts Dancing
We should focus on nature instead 👍🏻
They are feeling happy whn dog is barking but reality will be that robotic dog will be used instead of dog and dog will get extinct ...this earth will be a planet for robot&#39;s humans gonna face trouble these robot&#39;s will laugh on humans a day 👍🏻
Badass lil doggo
This robot is terrifying...
The robot is from Battlefield 2024
Dog mind voice: am I looking at the butt or face, which end? I&#39;m so confused
Everyone is gangsta until the machine reveals the weapons it has
Maybe we&#39;ll be in the same position soon
Well dog is Very serious , he felling this is Very very wrong thing, 🥺
u good
So it&#39;s true...
I so need Arnold to provide voice for these machines 🙋🇺🇲🛠️🇷🇺
Actually <br>When dog barks <br>He want to say fuck you
Good Dog, by him in the leg
I thought the way the robot dog repeatedly bark was impressive.
lol,he totally has him surrounded
I wish Fido had gone and PISSED on the robot at the end.
Human: Haha dumb dog..<br><br>Dog: You idiot, what have you done!
Must be the precursor to the war of the worlds machine dog.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg6oeazTNY&amp;t=18">00:18</a> <b>Dude sees a dog</b><br>Also Dude: „Man Vs Machine“
Its interesting that it barks to the part of the robot where usally there supposed to be the head of an animal.
Bro if you do this experiment in India, the dogs will not only bark on it but they will make this machine into scrap by biting all parts 😂😂
Robot dogs make good BBQ,s
I wonder if this dog is related to the one next door to us...
Has that thing improved at all over the past 5 years?
For a good moment I thought the robot was dancing to impress the dog lol
&quot;Where is your head brother?&quot;
automated or remote controlled?
For those wondering, they&#39;re good friends now and have drinks at the local pub every Thursday night.
The machine barking non stop looks far more advanced to me than the tub on 4 legs.
When a deer thinks it’s a tiger
Still a better love story than Twilight
&quot;man vs. machine&quot;
I&#39;m with the dog
put them in a ring and make them kill each other
This isn’t any worse than a dog creating the perfect human android Just to scare us and make them laugh.
This technology is getting so impressive, I can&#39;t tell which one is real and which one is the robot
It isn’t far when AI is gonna take over mankind
Imagine if that thing had friggin laser beams attached to its head.
Pee on its leg!😂
Love the doggies
Desde Colombia 🇨🇴. Terminaremos los humanos ladrandole a la tecnología ?
Dog witnesses the terror of artificial life.
The dog is like: What&#39;s this piece of garbage on 4 legs?
Meanwhile in dogtube some years later, humans meeting robot human for the first time
Sluggish and slow compared to something that is alive
this makes me realize how insanely advanced living organizms are.
Idk why are they developing robots
What a gentle robot dog :p
This video is gonna be viral when the &quot;Robots vs Humans&quot; war goes in full swing. Poor dog warned us already about the impending danger.
He doesn&#39;t trust the weird shaped doggo cause he can&#39;t sniff its ass.
i am telling you that&#39;s a zombie not robot.
Wonderful,,,,
I think it is kind of a nightmare for the dog because of &quot;uncanny valley&quot; phenomenon, which, I think, is on some level applicable for animals too.
Bro METAL GEAR!!!!
Should have tried a play bow.
Boston Dynamics is evil. Legislations must be put into place for such companies before it&#39;s too late.
dogs is telling that machines is not better then me
dog vs machine&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;man vs machine
the new terminator movie looks dope
I like the robo dog , nice and quite.
Where have I seen these, with 50 Cal. Machine guns mounted, and capable of running Bear-Deer speed in rough terrain.. eagle like vision, and advanced sound systems... these will probably be combat mini tanks.. imagine 100s of these running through a forest after the enemy...
Omg and this was 5yrs ago....
It&#39;s not a robot,called robot is moving without remote control
GO DOG!!!!!<br><br>I would love to see the dog somehow rip that thing apart. The dog knows nothing good will come out of this &quot;THING&quot;.
man vs machine? It&#39;s a dog, not a man. So its Dog vs machine!
<b>even the dog is cg</b>
Dog is freaked out that this thing doesnt smell
Dog: Where&#39;s your butt!?!<br>         Where&#39;s your butt!?!<br>         Where&#39;s your butt!?!<br>         Where&#39;s your butt!?!
uncompairable
I love how a dog&#39;s natural instinct is to bark at anything weird or suspicious looking. 😂
“Kick its a$$ seabass!”
😂😂😂
Dog thinking, it’s lost its head and can still move around, this is a mean mother Fkr.
That dog reminded me of Tintin 😃
He is a brave Dog
Death meterials for human😶😶
Dog: Are you mocking me?

So uh...which one is the real dog :/
Dogbark Translation.. Not... Real... Not... Real..... Not.... Real... Not.... Real dog.
Has no one been warned from Black Mirror!?
The proper title is : The dog fighting for his future generations
The term “Uncanny Valley” (look it up) describes why the robot dog &amp; similar robots are sinister and creepy.   Even though I’m an engineer by profession, my instincts are to beat the crap out of that robot.
Secretly, I was hoping that robot will pull out a flamethrower and burn this lil&#39; thing
Он СТАНЕТ новой легендой, треки выходят у него прикольние, просто сами послушайте<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybUZETpTB60">https://youtu.be/ybUZETpTB60</a>
what a fake shit :D
I prefer the real dog.
yep schnauzers.
Three types I REALLY can&#39;t stand...<br>- Religious nutters that think that The Bible is a historical account rather than just a guide.<br>- Morons who walked away, after seeing The Matrix, thinking it was a documentary<br>- Conspiracy Theorists (Flat Earthers, Illuminati, Big Pharma, IMF etc...) Who think the whole world is watching them...AND DON&#39;T TRY TO DENY IT! I KNOW WHO YOU ALL ARE BECAUSE I&#39;VE READ YOUR FILES.
I love the robot’s little Q-tip feet! 😍😂
The dog knows.
They cut out the part where robot dog destroys real dog, and all the human witnesses.
Yorkies will clamp on for a leg ride. lol
Both are man made.
Aw so cute. The little pooch is scared and trying to scare it off
Your robot dog belongs to the scrap yard.
Dog: Turn this fucking vacuum cleaner off!
at least robot dog is quiet
Oh, its Terry From Tintin :)
Dog probably has PTSD for the rest of his life ...
I&#39;m with the dog, that thing is evil, and the dog knows it.
I&#39;m with the dog........
What kind of dog is that ? 😍<br>P.s I&#39;m asking about the kind of the real dog
That dog knows evil when he see it.... A. I. robots.
Dog probably be like: LOOK AT THIS THING! LOOK FROM EVERYWHERE! LOOK AT IT!
That robot is moving so much smoother
Che puttanate di invenzioni , non servono a un cazzo !
iDog
Why do so many comments say that the dog is aggressive? Look at his tail! He is having a blast!
気持ち悪いｗ
Every dog is gangsta until robo-dog shoots laser out of its eyes
Raro no le hayan montado ya una ametralladora en el lomo...
Try this experiment in INDIA.....definitely you will get new lesson &amp; project from street dogs 😏😏😏😏
In future , we will in place of dog and machines will dance like this.
Should just chop off the dog&#39;s head and mount it on the robot dog that would scare the living shit out of anyone
OH my GOD !!!! this is AWESUM , oh my god ,,, is this a AMERICAN
Plot twist: they&#39;re both robots.
I&#39;d be scared to if someone without a head came prancing at me.
是一我一就一直一接一拿一開一山一刀一把一這一隻一亂一吠一的一畜一生一砍一死
Dog first time seeing another dog without head and tail...
Stop it.. this is stressful for the dog
I find these robots disgusting to look at! Weird and Why???
Dog : U R NOT REAL DOG!!!!
One day the robots are gona tear us apart 🙄
The new hotdogs are gonna be self roasted ones Environment friendly steaming 🔥 directly from the processor
Bruhhhhh what is YouTubes link to &quot;radio Sputnik&quot;?? They are trippin
Dog vs machine
It it scary from our perspective so it is no wonder the dog barks
This dog&#39;s reaction is like us humans being introduced to a Terminator for the first time.
What&#39;s the front what&#39;s the end
Would love to see this dog John Henry that thing.
<b>*dog barks*</b><br><br>man: it&#39;s a man vs machine<br><br>me: -_-;;; um... it&#39;s a dog.
I thought the dog will mate it.
Boston Dynamics? Hmmm it reminds me on Massive Dynamics. Fringe fans anyone?
Nice robot.
Fido tried to warn the humans, but they all just laughed
I would shave that dog
Just think if there were more intelligent species than humans and they made human robots for us to pass there time watching us being curious.. 😂
Drop both dogs off in the wilderness... see which one is able to walk to civilization... I guarantee the robot will sputter and &#39;die&#39; before a couple of days.
I&#39;m sure the &quot;Combat Ready&quot; ones will have armor all around. You could put one .44 Round in it and it would be toast.
Cyberdyne is coming... 🤔
I can&#39;t believe the dog just told the bot to go back to where it came from!
Why do these guys get to play with robots? Life isnt fair man :(
Yeah... Keep laughing stupid humans... You will soon know 🙃
I wish that bastard faced a pitbull.🤨
Good doggie.
The same will be our reaction when we see a cyborg
It would be funny if the robot had a wagging tail.
Главное что это не пивная кега
And a few more papers down the line it will look and sound like Spot. What a time to be alive!
It&#39;s all fun and games right now.
wow. it barks a lot. idk what i was expecting.
Dog: woof<br>Bot: YOU WILL BE OBSOLETE IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER

So damn fake come on people

Rage against the machine
Dog is trying to find the back so that he can make friendship with AI dog
As a great Brazilian musician and composer Walter Franco used to say, half progressive, half jazz and mixed with other rhythms and musical styles of the 70&#39;s, &quot;the dog&#39;s smile is on its tail...&quot;<br>As an allusion that humans who spend a lifetime looking for the smile in a dog&#39;s mouth and sad that they never get smiles, while the smile was there all the time at the other end and compared to what we expect from the other people and from life itself about they could bring to us, when we think that something only manifests itself if it is the same way and with the same attitudes as we do, but they were manifested in other ways and we didn&#39;t notice it in the right places and ways. because they&#39;re not us acting, but them.<br>It turns out that the other observer is a dog in fact that was born reading this literally and not in a methaforic way and doing the same thing and without the movements of a tail in this robot there, he won&#39;t understand anything that the other wants to mean.
Lol if someone was actually behind that remote control robot. Ultimate troll 😂
Dog sir protesting against future job loss.
Tintin is still trying to explain to him what kind of robot-dog it truly is
Robot disturbing citizen dog are ready robot nightmare of the future
Humans: Haha, this will replace the dog one day.<br>Dog: It&#39;s not me that should be worried
Shut the fick up it hasn&#39;t hurt you or even tried for minutes like stupid fucking dog be quite

Terribile ... il futuro che ci attende
Dog instinctively knows this unnatural thing must be stopped at all costs.
Dog translation: &quot;You took mur job!&quot;
After some decades humans will fight for their identity as this little dog is doing..
The dog knows.  These things were designed to kill us all.
At least they can&#39;t look cute
I was hoping for robot dog to crush real dog with one leg, boring.
Gotta give it a tail.
I would get rid of the dog, he barks too much.
what breed of dog is this?
The human race is headed for real trouble
The owners of the dog thought it was cute, but the dog was traumatized and had nightmares for six months in a row.
Evem the dog knows this is not right.
Next: Real human meets robot human for the first time.
You ever seen black mirror
The dog equivalent of Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla
Everybody is laughing till this shit takes their jobs
OMG !  That  was LOL !😂😂😂👍👍👍👍❤️❤️
Was anyone else waiting for some rocket launchers to come out and blast the real dog?
pee jimn didy!!?
Doginator
Dog: Who are you?<br>Robot dog: I am you but better
Who was hoping it was going to kill the dog 🤚
No robots can occupy the space of dog,they don&#39;t have such a loving heart that of dogs
Terminators becoming reality.
Did he say man against machine? Lol
Just wait till a laser shoots out of its ass.
The dog can sense evil and that thing isn’t right.<br>Just wait till that robot is armed <br>It will be a horrible day for humanity.<br>Interesting and cute in its early primitive form<br>When it gets armed with a kill program and the weapons “tools” to make it happen....not so cute
Is robot is operating by itself or by person
Wish the robot pulled out a gun and shot the stupid loud mutt.
Now we need guns and rpg’s lol.
I wonder what would happen if the robot did the head down butt up play stance of a dog..... Like I wonder if the dog would want to play with it?
&quot;man vs machine&quot; - dumbest human ever recorded

What da dawg doing?
Why give a fuck about the stupid robot when it&#39;s the actual dog that has all the character and life. Fuckin robot is pointless
😁
吠えてる方が新型らしいね。
It must be hard for Boston Dynamics considering how many evil applications their creations could be used for.
which is the real one?
Psychiatry is a scam run by the rulingElite
this ai will lead to destruction if we dosent stop yet
This is a sign…
Schnousers are not afraid. Great dogs..
It never showed the playful bow stance that dogs do to show they are friend and want to play. 🤔It also doesn&#39;t have a tail to wag. The robot lacked dog body language. 😔
That&#39;s one of those &quot;Houndeye&#39;s&quot; from Half Life. Lol, dang thing walks exactly like em.
He has a clue that these machines will replace them ...
Well, that was annoying. I&#39;m glad they aren&#39;t my neighbors.
Why does this video have a fact check under it?
Robot shit. That’s a freak not a dog. Humans insanity
If you translate this mustache dog&#39;s barkings, you will realize he is warning us about Cyberdyne.
Ayo tf your head at
Why do i see us humans with the same reaction in a few years to a robot messing with us?
This thing will kill you next year…..

I would literally be scared if I saw this thing 😤
Why was I expecting a Laser to come out of the Robotic Dog half way through that video? ... I may have come back to the wrong year.
What breed is the dog?
&quot;Man vs machine&quot; he said<br><br>What an idiot
Machine:  Dance around.<br>Dog:  WTF IS THIS?   &lt;bark bark bark...&gt;
Everything is ok but why didn&#39;t they build a head for it.
Did he just say &quot;man vs machine&quot;?
I want to see a horse sized one
The robot doesn’t smell like an animal but acts like one. It confuses the dog
I&#39;ve been playing a lot of Horizon Zero Dawn lately, so my immediate thought was, &quot;This is gonna go badly for the dog.”
Creepy.
People really have to stop calling it a robot dog.  It&#39;s a robot.<br>     Positioning it as a dog (&quot;Spot&quot;) is a mere PR and marketing ploy.<br>     Considering what its function is likely to end up being, it would make sense to just start calling it a robot soldier right now. Or a robocop.
It&#39;s missing the wagging tail accessory, so much was lost in translation.
It’s all aahhh, until one of those things turns up fitted with an ar15
Notice how the dog used the shape of the legs to tell apart the front and the back and mainly kept to the back of the robot quite interesting
What is it Lassie? The cow had a baby and you ate the plasenta?
Never trust to intelligence ! Trust is only in the souls and hearts 💕
The end is near
Dogs will be Dogs........
Nerd behind the camera is about to nut.
Meanwhile dog - U freaking idiot!<br>You can&#39;t replace me.
Twist :machine dog has no function to bark
Plot twist : Both of them Husband Wife having fights no need to say who won. 😁😁
I was waiting for the little guy to take a sniff of the robot&#39;s rear end.
Perfect video to see how far we are. While it’s great and impressive, but the robot is still very far from being that mobile and able to turn, move like a real dog
To the assholes developing this kind of technology, I hope you remember what you&#39;re doing when you get torn to shreds by these pieces of satanic machinery
Everyone: “Awe that robot is so cute”…..<br>Dog: <b>Literally scared out of his mind</b>
That is not a &quot;robot dog.&quot; That is a robot. It will never be a dog. Ever.
Not sure what is more annoying... the constant barking or the humming noise of the robot dog.
All dogs are gangster til the robot dog activates the laser gun.
The dog&#39;s leg movements are infinitely more complex.
it&#39;s over for meat doggos. They&#39;ve become obsolete. Now the meat masters are next.
so why is russian state media posting this?
&quot;Oi m8, where&#39;s yer vaccine passport? YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO COMPLY...&quot;
C&#39;mon doggy destroy that thing!
Even the dog knows this machine is evil
Make it look like a dog and give it barking audio.
The robot looks like it’s trying to get away from the dog but doesn’t know where to go and then just slumps down in defeat
Why do I need xenophobic warnings about the russian government? liberals sure are intolerant
What is this comment section
that biological machine is far superior
“This thing is going to take our jobs” - dog
FATHER! WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU!?
Those little hops seemed to anger the dog more lol
Snowy , come on , its  just a Robot !
reverse uncanny valley
I wanted the dog to bite it.  :)
Your neighbours will love this
This is the cutest video of a machine that can only be used for murdering shepherds in the Oil Wars &lt;3
why is a <del>commie</del> Russian-government-funded channel posting videos of happenings in America? And people wonder why Americans tend to think they&#39;re the center of the universe all the time.
It&#39;s all fun and games until the blue light turns red
what is the name of that mustache dog?
Just  put out your laser cannon and beat the shit out of this little cud.
See Real Dogs are Better
Man vs machine.... confirmed dog is man
This is xiaomi robot dog..
Little dog doing little play bows not seeing reciprocation and then it lies down suggesting danger. Poor sausage
Joke around all you want it would literally take 2 cane corsos to take that thing down
Metalhead
Some battlefield shit right there
Even the dog knows something is wrong with that. Just wait until it has lasers doggy.
Robot Dog ....... he definitely needs a head.
I hate robots, just like I hate cameras and drones. They are anonymous spies  taking over our spaces and making us paranoid.
An annoying dog that keeps barking
and the dog even dont look at terminator ;) to know about boston dynamics !!!!
I think the Man&#39;s Bestfriend can smell that thing will eventually be Man&#39;s Worst Enemy.
Dog be like: You ain&#39;t taking MY job!
one day this real dog will know why u dont bark at the robot dog .
Which one is cyborg doggo?
Machine terrorist in future - remember our ancestors were threatened by dog species while our creators laughed &amp; filmed,time to take revenge Bhau Bhau Bhau Bhau🔫🔪
I love that courageous moustached dog
The dog is barking out facts!
Doggo only angry cuz he don’t know which end to sniff.
Dogs fear extinction??
Blow that robot the fuck up
The robot doesn&#39;t even HAVE a spot.
I thought a laser was going to blow up the dog
In movies, dogs can sense ghosts. In reality, they can sense a murder robot.
In 50 years, hopefully we&#39;ll have the first Metal Gear created.
Dogs know evil.
Great! Let&#39;s get rid of real dogs and replace them with robot ones!
I&#39;d like to see an African male lion&#39;s response...or a matriarch hyena.
Fido is extremely annoying.  Bad dog, sit....
Scary 😱
The dance was epic tho...
That looks more like a donkey than a dog!!😂
I can hear the whine of the robot.  That is what is probably upsetting the dog, at first.  A lot of dogs bark at string trimmers and blowers.  Dogs don’t like the high pitch sound they produce.
It’s all fun and games until that robot starts barking
Basically, in a hundred years, dogs will still be incredibly annoying.
What if we call them biotic dog 🐶 and abiotic dog 🤖..
The machine is probably like<br>&quot;You&#39;re not that guy pal&quot;
nice Steel type Pokemon you got there!
“They’re gonna hunt me for sport?!”
Put a tail on it
great, more terminators
The Welsh Terrier knows...
Traumatized the dog smh
Dog: Run. These humans will chain you up and lock you inside their homes and force you to eat food that looks like cereal and potted meat.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg6oeazTNY">0:00</a> <br><br>Robot Dog: &quot;Robotic dogs are superior in every way, No attacks, no smell, no pooping, no....&quot;<br><br>dog: &quot;What about the heart...the heart man!?

Get your soulless, metal ass back here now!&quot;
All I saw was a yappy dog.
Call me a Luddite. If I saw that walking down the street id smash it lol.
Well if this works like the turing test, I guess the robot is now officially a real dog.
<b>sees the dog playing with the machine</b><br>man: MAN VS MACHINE!!!!!!!!!
Now do it with an intelligent dog like a German Shepherd and see what happens. 😏
This is the first dog who is afraid about his job that will stolen in future
dogs know whats right and whats wrong instinctively. M against all this, nature is supposed to lead the world, not humans or this type of ..
&quot;It&#39;s all cgi&quot;
Didn&#39;t see the &quot;Real&quot; Dog anywhere in the Video.
I hear of people online calling videos like this as &quot;Fake&quot;; After watching, i wonder how?
I just think it&#39;s really neat that the dog identifies where the front of this &quot;animal&quot; is based on its anatomy and directs its aggression to where the &quot;head&quot; of it should be despite it not having one.
Dog to human: Don&#39;t let it pee on the furniture. I will not be responsible for cleaning it&#39;s crap. That thing stays outside the house, or in the garage.
I&#39;m here to read the most hilarious comments
the dumbest humans ideas that came to life, number 1: <b>this</b>
Translating the dog talk: &quot;Danger! Run, get away from the humans!&quot;
This isn&#39;t cute nor funny. Wake up folks!
&quot;Look at that, man versus machine&quot; <br><br>Priceless
Is all laughs and giggles when that clumsy beast approach you but thats some serious kill machine you have there, ever seen one of those in the wild? no right? same as a ninja, when you notice them is too late because you are already dead, fox terriers are truly savage animals.
Well at least robot dogs are not so fucking annoying.
I find these robots terrifying. They will be used against us. God help us all.
I love Wired Hair Fox Terriers!  #1
Wouaf wouaf wouaf wouaf, is this the only word you have learned? I&#39;m sorry but how do you want to communicate with only one word?
One day doggos will help warn us of the approaching swarms of drones sent to murder everyone in the hidden villages of free men.
Don&#39;t trust VP.
the dog thought &quot; these fucking humans are not even able to keep us lifetime with care  and love, so wtf with that shit ? &quot;
I think that these robodogs, whatever you want to call them, are really spawns of Satan. We are messing around with things we simply do not understand.
Come on.. take a bite 😀
We all just need to paws for a second. While these two might still seem a little ruff around the edges they still deserve a round of a paws.
I really don&#39;t get all this passion about robots
The dog is boston terrier
Nobody thinks this video is cute except the employees of Boston Dynamics. And they HAVE to say it&#39;s cute or else.
robot: u mortal just barking because ur master is behind u. Just let me call my master T-800
Even a dog knows it&#39;s bad news.
The uncanny valley effect
The design of this thing is awful and creepy
Doog: &quot;Look at what they need to do just to mimic a fraction of our power&quot;
The real dog has front legs and hind legs. Why has the robot two sets of equal legs? That is not how dogs walk and jump. The robot may walk, it will always look weird, as long as it doesn&#39;t get better rear legs. Designers, can&#39;t you see that yoursslf? This is a walking table, a good one, just not a robot dog.
Later this won&#39;t be fun people wake up!
isle of the dogs moment
Dog knows best!
I can never tell if these are real or CGI, and that scares me. Weren&#39;t some of the earlier vidoeos CGI? The one where engineers are bashing the robot?
The dogs herding instinct are coming in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg6oeazTNY&amp;t=19">0:19</a> &#39;man&#39; versus machine? Someone tell the guy that&#39;s a dog.
the humm. sound sucks
Irritating
15  years later, the same experiment, the Robot Dog fries our friend with a laser because he is annoying.
ROBOT= Automa, automatic mechanical operator controlled by an electronic brain, with particular reference to programmable devices used in some sectors of industry and scientific research for serial and automatic operations.<br>-----------<br>This is NOT a Robot, but a radio controlled device.
Dog: “This machine is actually a bomb!”<br>Human: “hey, fight him.”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg6oeazTNY&amp;t=53">0:53</a> robot dog turned out to be robot cat.
This dog afraid of loosing his job
Dog knows it job is at stake
Soon it will be our turn
That&#39;s a lovely dance by the robot doggy. I wish that it could be programmed to do such things on its own initiative, than being remote controlled. Isaac Asimov had a good vision, a humane vision, about robots.
MAN VERSUS MACHINE? DOES THIS GUY NOT REALIZE THAT&#39;S A DOG?
Let’s you know like is getting wired …
Have it roll over on its belly. That how dogs show they are submissive. Maybe the other dog will stop barking.
If all people gathered to make a hound , they would not be able even if they spent what is on the earth und  Even if they studied millions of years.<br><br>Only God is able to do that
This dog warned us, now these robots pisses beer
Este video es viejo. Ahora ya bailan y toma. Te. Y cuidado que te pueden seducir a tu esposa en unos años .
Dog be like: come on robo boy fight with me come on,this earth is mine,I made u
Try that with a pittie, robot.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg6oeazTNY&amp;t=25">0:25</a> he was like. &quot;Dude, are you seeing this? Your not gonna come help me?&quot;
Dogs hate Terminators.
Prime example of a dog with a bark bigger than its bite.
God created the Dog with beauty and intelligence.<br>Whenever i see beauty i see God almighty
That thing can barely move -- ridiculous!
That dog is having an uncanny valley moment
Painting the walls of designer
Put a mastiff out there with it and all you will have left is pieces of scrap
The Dog : Where is his butthole ? How do i smell it and say hello ?
CHE MERAVIGLIA
This will destroy the world one day as these robots take over  jobs/ dogs  / people
Hey BD Guys!<br>On the next model, add a vacuum cleaner.
Dog&#39;s like &quot;You ain&#39;t replacing me. Get that shiz outta here!&quot;
They need to add a wagging tail
can&#39;t wait for the robot dog to be used by the police and military to brutalize people...... seems cute now, but just wait.
this feels like when snuffles was belittled and misunderstood
After several iterations, one might imagine the widget as a Terminator come to wreck havoc on our present time only to be completely foiled and stymied by a wandering pooch.  Too ironic and funny.
What&#39;s that can of Pabst Blue Ribbon doing rotating around on top of the robot?
Arnold Schwarzenegger better not reboot another sequel watching this
煽りよるwww
That dog is too freaking cute.
Plot twist: &quot;Dog tries it&#39;s best to convince robot to kill all humans&quot;
imagine robots like these programmed by the elites. How exciting for us all.
Dog: wait a minute,your an imposter!!, fk humans
Legend has it the pup is still barking
Noisy pup was asking for death by laser. Machine pup is very patient.

That robot dog is one giant failure.
So funneh!  Love it! :)
We the people: That&#39;s so cool/funny/cute <br><br>Youtube: IT&#39;S RUSSIAN!!! REEE!!
The dog is like, &quot;We defeated giga pets and furbys. You will NOT replace us!&quot;
Dog: I smell no butthole, I ain&#39;t trusting it!
If my dog won’t let you pet him/her you don’t get to come into the house ! And that includes robots 🤖
ахахахаха.а в рашке в селе дровами до сих пор топят печку
Sorry bro, I still prefer analog dogs.
I wonder how tigers, lions and cheetahs will react to the robot.
I kept waiting for the heat ray to disintegrate the real dog.
Wow, a dog barking at a machine!
“I keep telling these humans that ambulating robots are a terrible idea!”
Amazing innovation until hacked or has a bug or someone programs it incorrectly.
That dog knows that there’s shouldn’t be robots
If the Robot could just roll on its back and show its belly, all this could be easily resolved. lol
<b>Dog: You sort of metal, u won&#39;t replace me dude!</b>
Reminds me of the Series called “Black Mirror”….. especially the one called Metalhead…..AI robot dogs…..very sinister
Soon this America robot is going to kill lots of human beings (non-America white) and monitor the people in the name of “democracy”.
look at that dog he have  beard and moustache
&quot;In other news, robodog vaporizes someones pet doggo.&quot;
I was waiting for the robot to pull out a laser weapon and pulverize the dog
The dog has the right idea.
I&#39;m sorry but both dogs are real. Try headbutting the robot, you will feel it to be Very real indeed. Maybe robot and biological dog.
I agree with the dog.
That&#39;s Tintin&#39;s dog&#39;s elder brother..

- мы используем собак что бы отличить киборгов от людей
truly horrifying.
It&#39;s the beginning of humans end
The robot dog needs a couple of large speakers hooked up to a T. rex sound source.
Very disgusting views of these manufactured forms.😬
Anyone else remember dogs being used to detect Terminators in the first movie?
Impressive, but I’ll have the dog, please. They teach us humility.
“Battle mode!” <br>How prescient.
Boston Dynamics has some amazing robots - can be seen on YouTube. I used to think it was awesome, back when I was impressed by the technology. Now I just fear and loathe ai, and Boston Technology seems ominous. 💀
The dog is way way more advanced and responsive.
Is that thing housebroken?
From Skynet to Dognet
The Fox terrier?
It’s cool machine that maybe be useful walking in mountain <br>I mean the size of small deer can put a lot of supplies on him and with u where u go
&quot;...belonging to Android co-founder Andy Rubin&quot;.<br>Wasn&#39;t Andy the guys name that invented &quot;The Turk&quot; that later becomes Skynet?
Dogs against technical revolution...
But the robot can&#39;t swim unlike the dog, can it?
🤮
Cute dog. Ugly robot.
Talking to a pet dog in English is silly and any amateur dog handler knows it. But &#39;smart people&#39; will not hear it or accept it as true that they may be ignorant.
alternative title: real dog barks at robot dog for 1 minute
типичная шафка
More like a deer
Whats the point with this robot animal?
I really wish that A.I. was not inevitable.
he&#39;s going to kill you all ffs listen to me !!!
&quot;Man vs machine&quot; he says, thus identifying his dog as a man.
I&#39;d like to see what happens if the robot play bows.
How have not Boston Dynamics not figured out what Kongsberg did 12 years ago.....Is America really that far behind in both society and technology?
Can see the little one’s tail. He’s playing. :)
&quot;We use them to spot Terminators&quot; -Kyle Reese
Both dogs are cuties💖💖
The robot dog has 4 hind legs
That thing scares me too
It would be funny if the robot started barking back.
Where can I get this robot
When these things start getting hacked you morons might learn.
Everybody : Enjoys a robot and live dog reaction<br>Boston Dynamics Dog: &quot;What the dog doin!?&quot;
The dog is saying, I just want to sniff your but you smell very strangely for a dog.
that thing is creepy
“Man vs machine” 😂😂😂😂
Wow! Horizon Forbidden West is looking so realistic!
Its all fun and games until the robot takes out the gun
The &quot;Awwww&quot; at the end lmao
Imagine that thing with armor and motion tracking machine guns. With a bit of speed would be terrifying.
Dog pees on t-100 and saves humanity as it rust and malfunction.
bicho burro
This Is Very Bad ........... Stop...... I warn you.... Stop..........
little yapping dogs are so pathetic -.-
that fur looks real
Robot dog needs a robotic tail in order to communicate effectively.
Garbage
My two would tear that thing to bits...
The dog that never shuts up vs the dog that never speaks.
That robot is not real lol. I don&#39;t this this particular robot exists.
The dog is wondering why it doesn&#39;t have a head!
Сегодня мы смеёмся. А завтра будем плакать от нашествия роботов.
They edited-out the part where it got back up and zapped the dog into a cloud of dust.
It&#39;s very nimble.
Waste of time, use technology to help people instead.
When those machines becomes too intelligent. Some psychopath hacker will find a way to hack them and BOOM just like in the movies we&#39;re done.
that dog is smart. I hate those things.
I like how the dog is flabbergasted how something it usually pees on, moves 😂
HaHaHa. !  Funny. Robot Tech !<br>Next Time I will bite it into the. Leg. !   😁🌹😁
Hahaha
IF YOU EVER WATCHED &quot;BLACK MIRROR&quot;<br>EPISODE: METALHEAD<br>THOSE ARE THE SAME !!!<br>HERE IS  YEAR 3014 AND THEY HAVE KILLED EVERYONE...
This is a trailor, to the future.
DId the dog ever approach and sniff the bot?
After AI ascends to supremacy, robo-pups will be their pets.
Destroy these robots immediately !!!  This is weak. All the material and mental energy of the dog&#39;s ass.
It’s just like in Terminator. The dogs always know.
Sheldon would&#39;ve at least rigged up the robot with a squirt gun, but you do what you want.
Skynet is becoming real
The doh vonguse
Thats funny
동물의 인지능력은 어디까지일까
My dog would just stare...
Plot twist: The robot is a real dog&#39;s mind uploaded to the machine and the dog is actually a robot
The dog just found a terminator. 😨😁
不審者A
How is that playing? The dog is clearly terrified and in cautious mode.
Imagine what happens in that dog&#39;s brain. Seeing a strange animal, without visible eyes or any features typical for most animals, and also what&#39;s the most important, it doesn&#39;t smell like anything, it doesn&#39;t have a smell at all. It can&#39;t be bargained with. It can&#39;t be reasoned with. It doesn&#39;t feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.
&quot;Real dog&quot; is kinda redundant.
DOGMINATOR.
I got a double barrel shot gun for that robopup.
Kill the metal one,   feed the barking one.
And what&#39;s the danm point on building a robo dog costing a ridiculous amount of money when real dogs are locked up in shelters needing to be fed and cared for?!
Wow last book of the Bible KJV Revelation is happening in front of our eyes. Good news The Gospel 1 CORINTHIANS 15 1-4 KJV The shed Blood of Jesus Christ. Please see Brother Robert Breaker HOW TO GET SAVED a 14 MINUTE VIDEO.<br>Peace be unto all.
As everyone who has seen Terminator knows, dogs can sense and do not like robots.
Only the intellect constructed in Boston would generate such a theatric induced device; nice induced theatrics however. Yet we must remember this fact: some guardian(s) worked very hard to provide over one hundred thousand dollars to the institution that allows the pupil to simulate such a creation.😉!
August 29, 1997.  The day Skydog became self-aware...
Remember when The Terminator tried to warn us of this?..... well that dog sure does.
i imagine hyenas ganging up againts it
Why isn&#39;t the mechadog barking back?
Dog rules. If it&#39;s wierd bark at it. 🐕😆❤️
They made a robot dog that can do do almost everything but can&#39;t bark.<br><br>Wow
Dog is a dog
Boring...
Is Radar on your health  ?
Carbon neutral by 2050.
Creepy
Hahaha Thanks
this metal does not smell dog&#39;s urine. no smell no friendship between these two.
That robot can kill.
Even a dog knows AI are human enemies...
Real animals knows more than we do if they don&#39;t like something  they&#39;ll let you know it. It has to do with robots vs real animals alot of people r not listen to warnings
Stand still for facial scanning, citizen. Your social credit score is down 3 points this month, would you like to request counseling?
A dog experiencing its version of lovecraftian Horror. Say hello to his personal Cat-thulu.
The robot dog is dancing😂
Could you guys put some type of a head on that thing, (below the spinning radar)
How I hate that beast I.A. Tear them all down, Lord Jesus.
What breed is the dog?
There are dogs that bark at clothes hanging out to dry. Not so interesting.
Dog: “ I don’t trust like that”
...metal... gear!?
The government will deploy these to make sure we get our vaccine
A real Boss fight
fuck boston dynamics
&quot;A Weapon to Surpass Metal Gear&quot;
Ну что, где-то пригодилась эта фигня? А, нет, не пригодилась, по прежнему бесполезное овно
luvin all these dog comments, yet another dumb dog , rather have the electric one next door instead of the annoying barking all day
I&#39;m sorry.  But that robot is horrifying.  This society is so screwed.
It&#39;s a robot. A dog is a living, feeling being. In some cases more alive and feeling than some people.Look at the pristine beauty of the dog&#39;s movements and behaviors. You will NEVER get these from a machine. That&#39;s why they want to turn us into cyborgs.
I&#39;m amazed by the technical prowess and yet, this robot looks really creepy.
twist: the dog is a robot too.
twist: the dog is a robot too.
Dog can sense the evil spirit attached to the AI hardware
can they make a robot who can make french fray 4 u ? I&#39;d buy one, imagine you wont have too cook 4 ever. Like the old American dream where canned food looked as the pinnacle of inovation and covenience
Brave because scared
La gente no lo aprecia, pero cualquier perro es mas compuesto y avanzado que ese pedazo de metal, y aun asi ese pedazo de mental cuesta mas que un perrito, que ignorante somos, tenemos lo mas avanzado en nuestras manos y creemos que la tecnología lo es.
great achievment in constructing a robot dog but what is the need for one?
Robot Dog fools the expert.
doge: wat are you??<br><br>robodoge: i&quot;m you but clunkier
Boston Dynamic needs to disappear
James Cameron was right the dogs CAN identify a terminator.
The dog is smelling every human hand which has touched that Robot
It looks like something from a dystopian novel. I don&#39;t mind the idea of search and rescue getting these, but I&#39;m sure the cops have enough military tech.
When that thing started dancing 😂😂😂😂😂.....
常に変な音が出てる
動きが怖すぎ、夢に出てくる。<br>そりゃ犬も吠えるわ…
The poor dog.<br>This is animal cruelty, putting the dog in such (for him) scary situation.<br>Thumbs down and reported video.
Dogs can smell Terminators
the dogs can smell the terminators
Terminator movies said &quot;we use dogs to identify the machines&quot; GOOD BOY
When a good creation with a heart meets a senseless monster.
Democrats use Machines to Cheat on Votes.. Yo...
What breed of dog is that? He/she is so cute.
I would have liked to see how long would the dog have kept barfing at it before getting bored..
Excellent dog for people who leave their dogs alone 12 hours a day.
You can apply now that robotic dog into a Giant star wars AT-ACT...
犬を仕留めろ🙋‍♀️
Ihr Idioten.. Ihr werdet an Eurer eigenen Scheiße verrecken..
Hmmm poor dog
The dog is trying to have a conversation with it but it just keeps ignoring him.
Putin Propaganda!
Dogs the real friend to mankind, They know that the machines are rising.<br>That dog is not barking to that machine, In his own way he is trying to warn us!
Wait till it’s weaponised to hunt down the unvaccinated
Bearded Dog 👍
People are mad. Dog is just a perfect creature of nature. What need is there for this monstrosity made by madmen?
The most of all thinks : this dog is dumb.. But he isn&#39;t dumb.. <br>The Dog knows that this machine isn&#39;t good for us and him.
I support a robot uprising, look at how RUDE that dog is being to that poor, innocent robot!
音が見えているのか、動きが見えているのか、フォルムが見えているのか、一体犬は何を見てるものなんでしょう
Who knows the is also a robot
Real Dog Meets C.G.I! KKK!

It passed the pawing test
Good dog.  Now go and bite the freaks who make these damned things.
Horizon Zero Dawn !
All fun and games until an arm extends out the robot and grabs little barking dog.
That dog is smarter than his human counterparts ! He doesn&#39;t like that damn thing and neither do I !
Robot does tha Ali shuffle on the dog.
Robodogo looks like a double ostrich.
Machine should have attacked it  That dog was an eminent threat to owner.
One good thing about robotic dogs is that they don&#39;t bark
Just look for the fuse
it&#39;s all fun and games until &#39;ROBODOG&#39; goes in to &#39;defense&#39; mode!!!!!
What does this video have to do with Radio Sputnik?
Great
Wow, what a bunch of flat-earthers. Yessss, the AI hates you, and wants you all to BURN IN HELL!!! I guess it&#39;s not surprising to find conspiracy nuts on a Sputnik site.
The real dog be like: IMPOSTER! IMPOSTER!! GO AWAY!! WHAT ARE YOU?!?! WHERE THE HELL IS YOUR HEAD!?! I SAID GET AWAY!!!
I thought the robot will shoot laser at the dog.
Omg lol 🐕
Anyone that thinks robots are good need their heads testing. They&#39;ll take your jobs to start with then anything else they want!
Love this one! Dog vs MechDog
I want a robot dog :D
That’s what bad ppl wants the humans to be A robot
These robot dogs are eerily alive seeming
Yeah, and just wait until they start to arm those motherfckers...
They’re gonna be best friends some day
Imagine being scared of a computer.

It doesn&#39;t even bark.  Stupid nerds.
I despise Athens.
This has me planning to rewatch Black Mirror&#39;s &#39;Metal Head&#39; episode
Real Terminators.
Walks like a spider
Wait till they fight back

It&#39;s all fun and games until the robots become self-aware on August 29, 2028.
Dog vs dog
This dog has more intelligence than machine
its seems like two chicken leg in a box
That thing is an abomination
There is only 1 good boi here
wtf is that robot gonna be able to do for humanity???
Robots are grotesque. Artificial intelligence: there&#39;s nothing intelligent about anything that&#39;s artificial and there&#39;s nothing real about something that&#39;s artificial. How are people falling for this?
Why Don&#39;t You Build One Like AMEE?
Look at all the comments of both Terminator fans and sceptics about being locked in camps or exterminated. Do you know how this works? Do you even know what an AI is? Judging from your stupid comments you have no clue which is quite sad. Get a grip on reality!
Yeah, we get it... dog barks at robot.  ZZzzz.... ZZzzz.... ZZzz.... ZZzzz.... ZZzzz.... ZZzzz....
ㅋㅋ 짓기는 하는데 이게 먼지 몰라서 공격은 안하네

They remind me of the aliens in war of the worlds tv show on starz. I don&#39;t like them one bit nope
Creepy
A robot realistic. enough to fool your dog.
This is not à &quot;robot&quot; its controled by à controller not automatic
&quot;Shut up, carbon based life form, and bow down!&quot;
That dog is right to fear this virus of robot
I was waiting for the robot to hike its leg up and REALLY make the little guy mad.
This is creepy
I, for one, am looking forward to our dog robot overlords. They’re too cute to be that angry with, and, if we play our cards right, we might just be allowed to sleep in the bed with them (but only at the foot of the bed).
Reminds me of the one episode from Tom and Jerry
Remeber how dogs used to bark in Terminator when they saw the T-800?
Imagine the robot shooting a laser
Well, we know what dogs think of weird robots. Also, why doesn&#39;t it have a head. It makes it seem so sinister.
They will definitely put guns to it. What a fucking dystopian world we are about to experience and it won&#39;t take long.

You should teach the robot dog to do a play bow.
Clearly Spot needs a tail to wag.
Tell that dog to shut up

I will translate the words he said to you:<br><br><i>&quot;Humans, how could do such blasphemy to our Canine-Kind.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;You have replaced us. Digusting.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;Humans are more stupid than I thought, a waste of precious materials.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;It should have been a Chew Toy rather than a cheap copy.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;The noises it makea disturbs our Auditory Centrals.</i><br><i>It sounds ridiculous. Atrocious. You must turn off this</i> <i>piece of abomination perhaps???&quot;</i>
Thats how i met your mother ?
I can only Imagine the dog with the voice and demeanor of Charleston Heston at the end of planet of the apes.  <br>&quot;You Fools! You Madmen! What Fatal Hubris, What Fevered Insanity Inspired You to Create this Unholy Trinity of Man, Dog and Dyson™!? Damn You! Goddamn You All to Hell!&quot; <br>That&#39;s just how I hear it.
This looks scary as hell. I can&#39;t be only one who feel that way. Like some cyber-monster drone from System Shock franchise. Can&#39;t they make it somewhat tolerable? : /
Real dog meets spot
Look at that tail. That dog is nervous  AF 😂
This dog senses the future.
Stop playing god!!! Youll doom us all!!!
That&#39;s a zombie headless creature, really scaring due to its alikness with a living one
the dog is so confuse ,he want to know where this dog came from but there is not smell

I know alot of people are swept off their feet with all this tech, and I admit that it appears fun. However...this shit is creepy.
Toy
Boston makes good job...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg6oeazTNY&amp;t=23">0:23</a> shut up and dance!
いっぬが戦ってる(外や何かに向かって吠えてる、威嚇してる)時はぼーっとしてる飼い主を守ってる時。
fantástico
Waiting to see another dog try to hump it.
It&#39;s like a Terminator, but for dogs.
Terriers, toughest pound for pound dogs ever.  Cutest beards ever also
If you ever meet one of these things, please destroy it. Go and seek them out.
y’all realize this the exact moment robots decided to kill al humans for making it so fkn incompetent. robogodzilla would rekt thats dog.
the evil robot will kill not only the dog but the humans soon after
it knows that thing is a terminator!
The dog is barking at the robot like it was another dog.
Роботу нужен хвост
Now that’s a metalhead
Suggest your mother or father. I didn’t subscribe.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg6oeazTNY&amp;t=24">0:24</a>  He invite the dog to dance !!!
Kept waiting for Boston to fire his disintegrator ray.
That means find something worth doing....
That doesn&#39;t mean do it better....
Embarrassing at worst..
Half ass at best...
I&#39;m not hating on your robot, I am asking what you accomplished?
There are amateur boxers with better footwork, only theirs is half memorized. <br><br>This is like trying to make a boxer look like he knows what he is doing, only everybody can tell he doesn&#39;t....
This robot behaves nothing like a dog, nor is there a function that comes to mind in which it may...<br><br>Even if it were a &quot;decent&quot; replica, what function has been accomplished? <br><br>SAD
Boston Dynamics = Cyberdyne Systems
that thing to me looks weird
Dude I want to kick this dog
I wonder what the dog actually thinks it is?
get&#39;em scotty
Rage against the machine.
キャンバー？の制御まで細かい！
What a cutie...I mean the dog.
Absurdo.
This reminds me of a saying ive adopted from dog training.&quot;german shepherds are not really dogs;there more like super computers with fur&quot;,looks like your on your way to building <a href="http://one.lol/">one.lol</a>.
We laughing at the dog how he reacts, but how will we react when we see a humanoid headless machine coming towards us?
The dog be like:<br>&quot;Who tf are you, n**ga?  Identify yourself&quot;.
Cute not until the robot just stab the dog
До чего шагнул прогресс, скоро собак роботами заменят.
Life   is  so tough.... It makes  u a robot  .... There is no place for  emotions 😐
Awe so cool.the real dogs a winner.great video.great build!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg6oeazTNY&amp;t=51">0:51</a> - That Welshie is in a handicapped spot.
You can&#39;t wear out a Welshie.
Kinda looks like Snowy, Tintin’s dog.
&quot;thats awesome&quot;<br>yeah its really awesome, just think of how awesome it&#39;ll be when they go door to door looking for ridiculous debts and serving unjust warrants
The dog is saying &quot;someone KILL this abomination right NOW&quot;!
<b>*real dog head suddenly opens and a little alien jumps and starts running*</b>
Poor thing. Even dog’s job had been automated.
C&#39;mon Dog!
In movies dogs always bark to evilness
orribile !!! questa sara´ la nostra fine.  : (
The dog was actually saying lay down.
What is that thing used for?
Robot dog, no, its a table with moving legs...
One can kill you and the other one can&#39;t.
Its like Terminator, dogs are barking...
fuck em up bobby!
It needs a wagging tail to show dogs it&#39;s friendly.
Man vs machine? More like Dog vs Machine...
My dog does the same thing with my lawn mower.
<b>Terminator theme</b>
<b>Dog internally freaks out like he&#39;s on an acid trip likely in his head screaming profanitys &quot;WHAT THE $%^&amp; US GOING ON?!? WHAT THE $%^&amp;!? WHAT THE $&amp;^%?&quot; as a human being would when discovering an alien race IRL.</b><br>Human: Oh cool it&#39;s like dog vs. machine!
italiani a breve tocca a voi !!!!
I don’t believe you stupid fucks know what you’ve created
No head. No teeth. No problem.<br><br>And it smells of lubricant.
I was just waiting for someone to come over and say &quot;Can someone shut up that scottie dog please?&quot;
Think,<br>You meet the Headless terminator for the first time. That&#39;s how dog felt
물어봐 이빨 다 꺠진다

Real dog meets Boston Dynamics CGI Robot Dog
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg6oeazTNY&amp;t=31">0:31</a> “Battle mode” turrets swing out from both sides and instantly murder the dog
It’s more like horse
Eventually they will kill us all
This is such a creepy machine.  Sick &#39;em  boy!
That dog is amazing
I&#39;d really like a steamroller to roll over that stupid robotic &#39;dog&#39;!
Robot but the human uses remote controler .....
Dogs will rally with fire torches and dog supremacist flags and shout<br>&quot; YOU WILL NOT REPLACE US&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEg6oeazTNY&amp;t=19">0:19</a> &quot;man vs. machine&quot;  That&#39;s one strange looking man.

Doggo at the end: And STAY down!
Dog: So my species is next to be replaced by a robot.
its scared shitless of it and so it should be.
Boston dynamics robot dog meets real dog for first time.
In the future people will have dogs to help them clarify who is natural and who is AI.
機械「降参です」
Скоро по всей планете такая хрень шляться будет
man vs machine, power extreme, treme, treme!
Imagine you must go on a dangerous mission, to defuse a bomb or something... and this little runt keeps annoying you while you doing your job.. then you just lay down and give up on life :(
Straight out of Terminator.<br> <br>Best reason to have a dog in the 21st century
Sputnik. Messing with paranoid schizophrenics (in the west) since 2014.
Spot and Fido, everybody! Big thanks to Person for filming this at Location!

How clumsy that robot looks compared with a dog.
Dog: &quot;Get tf out my hood, you Im Pos Terr.&quot;
Real dog: * sniff sniff* I can&#39;t smell him.<br>Robot dog in distance: ....🤖....
My Cocker would run away. He hates the sound of gas running through a gas meter and growls and backs away. LOL
Man dog is already worried about being replaced by the robots yet we&#39;re still chilling here
That’s a dog’s alert bark, it’s like, “Hey, hey! Come look! Come look at this! Come look! Hey, you guys! Hey! Hey! Come look!”
I&#39;ll take a real dog over a robot any day .
Go real doggy!
РЭССИ... Это ты? Что они с тобой сделали? Электроник, на помощь!!!
In the beginning there was men and for a time it was good
Its all fun until the robot barks back
Fun fact: the dog is a robot and the robot is the real dog
not a very well trained dog ..  Doesn&#39;t even listen
Robot: exists<br>Doggo: <b>WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>
He is a hop step dancing
I would pay a dog a year&#39;s worth of bones to tear that thing apart.
