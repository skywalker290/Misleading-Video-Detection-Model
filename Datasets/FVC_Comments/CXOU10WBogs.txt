1. The clouds above the house       moved.<br><br>2. OH LOOK, A MAGICALLY APPEARING PEPPLE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
that car was close <br>if he didn&#39;t move out of the way <br>he would of got hit
You almost got KILT by a fucking time traveler!!! Dude was hauling ass
Fake, the guy doesn&#39;t show in the reflection of the car&#39;s doors, whilst the black stones just behind him do. Pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXOU10WBogs&amp;t=4">0:04</a> and use the &lt; / &gt; keys to go frame by frame to see it. <br>Also his right hand isn&#39;t composited well over the car.
look how fast the car is going.. fake
Its fake but it was fucking good edited! I wish i was as good in editing. 
fake
Looked pretty fucking real at first. Nice edits!
fake and gay
Great edit but the acting gave away the fakeness before even contemplating if it was real or fake.
Good fake tho
Yeah, you can see the car in the background warp ahead. Pretty good edit though!
Getting hit by a car is just a risk you have to take when doing back flips.
