Feed the Shark hmmm
To be fair, five feet from shore is really only dangerous for people unable to swim faster than a tarpon.
Wish they had thrown that fish a bit far away from that spot.
Shark says thanks for the fish
Blondes, just handed the poor fish to the shark.
the gulls look like all the mexicans at the all u can eat Chinee buffet on East Riverside in ATX.  they gorge, then run to the shitter. lmmfao.
Lmao some.kid said &quot;GET IT!&quot;
They send that poor fish to his or her death dumb people bring it some where ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
YOU CAN NOW BUY A SHARK ALARM!!WHY DOESN&#39;T ANYONE BUY IT FOR THEIR LIFE???WHY DO PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT THIS MONEY???WOULD YOU JUMP AMONG THE LIONS PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT??WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE??I WISH YOU:NOTHING!!WHICH IS THE SEA OR OCEAN WITHOUT SHARKS???NONSENSE...-!!THINK NOW!!!WHY WOULD SHE ATTACK YOU??THOSE MANY SACRIFICES,THAT&#39;S EXATLY HOW SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IS..!WORTH IT???AT LEAST GO INTO THE WATER SHARK ALARM OR A DAGGER!!!
that fish was like nooooo leave me here the shark is waiting to eat me
I guess humans make dumb decisions when thinking they are helping a fish the same as they do when they think they are helping an animal in the woods or the suburbs,  or on a farm - saving animals from the mean farmers. Always stop and think is what I&#39;m able to do for this animal going to leave it better off or worse off.
I find it hilarious that the caption says in broad daylight like it should have stopped and secretly attacked some people are so silly
lol @ &quot;in broad daylight&quot;
Dumb. Move the tarpon a distance. Give the tarpon a chance. Did a good deed.
Don&#39;t to stand there picking your butt, dumb old people Help him!!
He Tossed the Tarpon Right back in with the Shark How incredibly Heartless Some people Can Be...Assholes!

Shark couldnt believe his luck; The people waited till it was fuc*ed then threw it back in for him.
Well, better the fish than a human. Nicely done hammerhead üëçüèª
Do you think people went back in the water after they saw that ? I don‚Äôt think they did lol
Waaaaait a minute.......... sharks eat fish?!?!?! (Ten years later)
Why did they throw it back to the shark
Good job you just fed the shark, lol

It would be terrifying to swim there! What Florida beach is that? We go to many beaches and never see such a moment.
The fish: well thank you very much, oh no wait..
That&#39;s disgraceful they had the chance &amp; they put it right back out to him üò°üò°üò°üò°
Way to go. Throw the traumatized fish right back to the shark. ü´§
Need to cull some species of shark
Happens
Sharks are people too.
-- Who would have thought that sharks feed where they choose (5 ft. from shore on a FL beach)?
What animal is a ‚Äútarpon‚Äù????
‚ÄúBroad daylight‚Äù like a crime was committed and the audacity of the shark ü¶à for wanting to eat during daylight in his home turf lol
.longer it took to get in water.longer survival time.he fed the tarpon to shark.tarp one of sharks favorite prey.happens on hooked.often.public is not educated always.
Good morning to all from SE Louisiana 21 Jul 22.
And the seagulls be like &#39;wana eat me too?&#39; üòÜ
Is there a narrow daylight?
This is not a ‚Äúshark attack!‚ÄùThis is a shark getting something to eat.
Idiots!! Walk the fish down the beach lady a little ways Jesus!! You just fucking hand fed the thing to the shark!
Just leave Nature alone.<br>By giving the fish back to the shark, all you did was cheat out a lot of scavengers on the beach a free meal.
In broad daylight?!? What&#39;s this world coming to?
OMG who does this - they know there&#39;s a shark there and they basically just hand this poor beached fish over to it on a platter. Beyond cruel!!!
Lunch well served !!*
That lady had a nice booty
thety shouldn,t have pushed the fish immediately they should have waited maybe he,ll go
He was hungry, that‚Äôs all. That‚Äôs nature.
GOOD JOB HUMANS üòÖ
Bet the tarpon was grateful the humans with the saviour complex came along. It‚Äôs not beached itself it‚Äôs still in water, wasn‚Äôt drying in the sand. Was tryna escape for a min. Fs. üòÇ
Are you sure that wasn&#39;t Ron DeSantis??
Maybe the tarpon would rather suffocate above water, than to be eaten below water.
I can‚Äôt believe they threw it back into danger‚Ä¶.Stupid . If they had just waited a little while, the Shark would of moved on. The Shark was smarter than they were‚Ä¶..‚ÄùCome on, Guys , throw it back to me ‚Ä¶. You can do it ! ‚Ä¶.
&quot;circle of life&quot;<br>&quot;Fish got to swim, sharks got to eat.&quot;
Idiots! Just walk further up with the fish to give it a fighting chance.

Title should read fish beats itself to avoid getting eaten done by standard storm back out to watch him get eaten
people just leave the fish alone, obviously the fish beached itself for a reason, and you rolled him back in and made it snack food. ever notice they don&#39;t throw you out of the water?
I can&#39;t believe those idiots feeding the shark back!!!!!!!!<br>&quot;You can come back any time, Mr Sharkie....we&#39;ll always have a snack for you&quot;.
Stupid people
Some people are just so stupid. If your going to throw a fish back into the water that was trying to get away from a shark. At least keep half of it to eat or give it to people to poor to to buy fish to eat. <br>     I went to a food bank today and saw a lady get out of an expensive car carrying a box to donate to the food Bank. As she put the Box down <br>Inside the front door. She said she was doing God&#39;s work and walked away wishing everyone well. The box was filled with expensive coconut flour 20 lbs ( 1 lb bags all which expired in 2016 ) may she Rot in Hell.

That sucks, the people on the beach have hurled that fish back out to the Hammerhead.
Never feel sorry for a shark or a Stingray, I say never...
THIS is exactly why I wont go out farther than waist deep water, unless I&#39;m in a boat, and NOT a kayak, surf board, belly board, and the like. Robert at 67.
and the two morons put the fish straight to the shark&#39;s teeth ....idiots wonder from where..:)
üñïü¶à üêç üï∑
First off. This is not a shark attack. This is hunting its natural prey in its natural environment. Those people were lucky to experience this first hand
Anyone who knows the ocean and Sharks knows that close to shore are where most attacks occur. It&#39;s a simple shark hunting technique to get smaller fish in the shallows. And really? If you do happen to rescue a Tarpon, like the man said. Give it a chance by releasing it up the beach away from where it came on shore. Otherwise you&#39;re just setting up a fresh buffet for the shark ü¶à
Sharks have to eat too
If they did intentionally to watch the shark kill the fish as entertainment...shame on them ..Than they will get bad karma for this ..
Nice co-op hunt lol
Cruel bastards fed the shark
Oh yeah jerks just throw it back in there so the shark can attack it and kill it what a bunch of idiots
You‚Äôd think that them people would have carried that fish a few feet further up the beach an then helped it into water so it could have survived from the shark..

Oh I thought it attacked a broad
&quot;In broad daylight&quot; is because they used to say sharks feed primarily at dusk and dawn.  Maybe that&#39;s no longer the case...
Thanks a bunch guys! üôÑ
Next time take it home and cook it
Ummmm dawg, sharks CAN &amp; DO attack N E time of the DAY &amp; NIGHT!! So, wht&#39;s with the title 2 this vid.. &quot;Shark attacks in BROAD DAYLIGHT&quot;?? LOFL
People swear out.... they&#39;re way of helping is always right. Basically sent the fish right back in...to get  slaughtered ü¶à....that was stupid.
It&#39;s just bluefish man....just blue fish
I guess the tarpon was close to shore too
I would have taken the harpon home..!<br>Better in my stomach then in a shark...! Hehe
Are you IDIOTS? YOU THROW BACK TO THE SEA THE POOR FISH!!!!Why did you do that stupid people??!!! That&#39;s inhumane!!!üò°üò° STUPID people!!!
In broad daylight? Really? You‚Äôd think these sharks would know to only attack at night by now üôÑ
Really cool footage
Attacked in broad daylight!<br>What!?<br>A shark ate?<br>Sharks usually do that, they eat, and they usually don‚Äôt eat people. <br>If people stayed out of the water every time there was a shark, they‚Äôre never go in
Tarpon: thanks for your help guys!
Not a shark attacküôÑ just a shark going after its natural food source. Don&#39;t be so dramatic
wow
...they merely fed the shark, how ugly
Hopefully you never held* another camera ever again
If I came across a hammerhead, I‚Äôd kick its ass. Roundhouse to the face and make it do shameful acts while I insult its mother.
Dinner! Thanks mate!
Dumb fucks try and save it by putting right where that bastard shark is..ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
In broad daylight??  Lol it‚Äôs not a crime.  It‚Äôs called nature
Shark: &quot;Thanks humans!&quot;
&quot;In broad daylight..&quot;<br><br>Said like they have shark police and curfews lmao
Just when you think you‚Äôre helping Mother Nature you go and screw it up.<br>Exactly why humans shouldn‚Äôt help.
That&#39;s was a nice tarpon, why they gave it to the shark?  üòÜ
Get the fking writing off the screen so can actually see it.
Why didn&#39;t they just put the tarpon on a serving platter?
Lmao shark attacked in broad daylight lmao what think he waits til night? They do feed at night but won&#39;t stop cuz it&#39;s day lol dam threw him right back into jaws should walked down beach Gave him a running start
That&#39;s a hammerhead shark that Atlantic tarpon it&#39;s toast that is a dead fish swimming
It&#39;s frustrating when some surfers proclaim that a large shark won&#39;t swim in 5feet of water. They have obviously never seen footage of 35 foot Orcas grabbing seals from the beach. F&#39;n morons.
Beautiful hammerhead
Sum people don&#39;t realise
Such a shame üòû
Seems like the poor fish was unlucky these humans came by, they tossed him right to the shark!  If they wanted to help why not pick the fish up and runn it down the beach far enough away so it has a chance.
The shark attacked the fish, but the humans did not do better. Quite disturbing! Poor fish.
<a href="http://ummm.how/">Ummm.how</a> long do u have to discuss saving a fish anyway..They r not good eating..great fish to catch..
Oh Also..right across Las Olas Blvd the Intracoastal  a man jumped in ( Ick ) for his evening swim..( again Ick) A huge school of hammerhead tore him up..the water  is brown..no can see!..Only time I went in was to pee..!!
Grew up right over the Las Olas bridge..on Poinciana on the Intracoastal..I  had no fear..I did have a shark very close to me once when I did not get out right away for a storm..lol.I had my Jr lifesaving cert from the Hall of Fame pool..so..Then 30 yrs later my boss gets attacked at Sand key Bahamas  after 30 yrs diving  there..Quite the story how he survived..he was even on Oprah. Lol I look behind me now..Eeeek!
Hahaha! I love the title of this video! &quot;Shark Attacks in Broad Daylight&quot;, you know, because sharks ONLY attack during daylight hours, because, you know, they don&#39;t have thumbs, which means that they can&#39;t carry flashlights, which means that they can&#39;t see in the dark, so, OBVIOUSLY, they can ONLY attack in broad daylight.  üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ
Stupid people. üòû
yes sharks get hungry and want to eat too even 5 feet from shore and in broad daylight!!! please be carefull in there territory!
We decided to vacation in Florida?
The shark was patiently waiting for the nice yankee tourists to push his meal back into the water.
Tarpon, think I‚Äôll lay here till it goes, people push it back in for the slaughter, now, tittle, not for the kids or squeamish? This is nature an how it works, this is nothing horrific but what life is about and should not be hidden and denied, that‚Äôs the reason for youth and idiots not knowing how life is, Mother cat allows the weakest not so bright to be a sacrifice for the others to learn from, we bubble wrap more and more and todays youth become more timid and unaccepting of how it works, let your kids see this, the timid, this is nothing but a little of reality
Coulda been your Meemaw‚Äôs leg!
Can you imagine the fish trying to get away from the sharks and he was helped back in the water. What a way to die. They were only trying to help. Let him stay on land he would have been safer
There goes the fish you helped.
Stupid better they would have taken it out, if the fish was on the shore it was for something, don&#39;t you think?

You will never ever get me in the ocean , I did once or twice when very young but I will never go in. I know the odds of being attacked are astronomical but there is always that chance.
What RETARDED people on the beach that day...
camera man needs to find a new day job or don‚Äôt post anything at all

Dang. Poor fish. Saved its life just to get eaten üò¢
Dude you just fed that fish to that shark. If you&#39;re going to release it like that you at least have to walk with it it out to the dropoff to give it half a chance.
That&#39;s a camera man I&#39;d be, focusing on lady wearing bikini üòÄ
I myself would have kept the fish for a meal,considering the prices we have now.
Do you &quot;attack&quot; when you eat? Or do you just eat? He was just eating.
They just condemned that poor fish to the shark lurking around.
Poor Tarpon, he got finished off.he&#39;d have died anyway. No use letting him suffer.
Shark Attack ? More like hammerhead eating a tarpon for lunch. Nothing abnormal about this at all.
People should really work on their camera skills‚Ä¶. Y‚Äôall take selfies for tik tok n all that bs but can‚Äôt keep a camera steady.
Its one thing for that no good shark to pull this kind of tomfoolery, but in broad daylight? What the hell is this world coming too? Outrageous!
Oh I&#39;ll save you. Oops. Gulp!
Warm waters, Fish, Shark, Tourist, its called &quot;Nature&quot; folks nothing to see here move along ?
That&#39;s a friendly shark.
Why did those people put it back in harms way?
IS THIS UBER EATS DELIVERY? I was disappointed the shark got him.i was like &quot;WOW THEY SAVED THE FISH...... NOPE SHARK FOOD. I wonder if that&#39;<a href="http://s.like/">s.like</a> feeding a goldfish &quot;ü§£ü§£ü§£
The tarpon when getting pulled back in* &quot;dafuk you doin?!&quot;
This isn&#39;t an attack. It&#39;s a hammerhead eating, something they do day and night. Adult tarpon eats other fish, shrimp, crab, etc.
Put the fish back in
<b>Those fish are frickin pests!!</b>
Can&#39;t complain about that whose hungry fresh fish and chips for dinner churrrrrrrr thanks Mako in my language Mako means shark
How come all of these amazing natural things keep happening in front of and to the worlds shittiest camera operators. Dear gawd.
Que burros <br>Echaron de nuevo al mar para que sea devorado <br>En la playa al menos estaba a salvo <br>Burros
Pero que inorantes son volverlo a echar el tiburon seguia ahi esperando para devorarlo
Great seeing the natural food chain still is working in nature. God is wonderful and Almighty, everything He made is perfect until man decided he can do a better Job, then the problems started happening.
Looks like a meaty tarpoon to me! ü§§
This video made me feel upset.. poor fish thrown back in the water to die defenseless ‚òπÔ∏è
I would have grabbed that fish and taken it home for dinner.
They saved it from suffocating just to get eaten by the shark
Yum..fresh fish..didnt even have to catch itüëçüëç..thanks mr munchie
Why didn&#39;t they help the fish alot sooner.
never go near a tampon

Out of the frying pan, into the fire, then back into the frying pan. That Tarpon had no choices left.
Yep hammerhead
being florida im assuming all safety protocol was seen to. no persons should be in the water in such circumstances. an accidental bite fom any shark can be life ening.
And they just throw the tarpon back in to its death üêüü¶àüò≤ü§î
Since when does it matter what time a day it is during a shark attack lol. Like its safer during the day pshhh okay bud
Wow. Makes you think
As I thought, comments are pure comic gold but throwing that fish back to the shark was genius.
rip tarpon
Plot twist: Tarpon can breath air. These people basically fed the shark, giving it confirmation that patrolling the edge of the water is a good way to get food handed to it.
Lucky not someone&#39;s dog!
That&#39;s a big hammerhead
If only tarpons could read.
I read most people are attacked by sharks in waist-deep water

I surfed that beach and many times I had to paddle in seeing the sharks coming down the shore looking to feed.
The fish would of rathered suffocate to death. Here come the land dwellers. &quot;Throw him back to the sharks!&quot; üòÇü§£
Big headline. Small content. Click bate.
That is the true meaning of &quot; from the fire to the frying pan&quot;üëç
Here in Ubatuba we had 2 sharks in 50 years,from november to today they were 4,and they¬¥re appering in every Brazilian beach,from north to south.
No you don&#39;t Mr. Tarpon, get back in there!
Just wasn&#39;t his day
People on beach: <br>Poor fish!!  He will die out of water.  Let&#39;s push him back in!!<br><br>Shark:<br>Nooooo!!  Don&#39;t you see the shark???  I figured I&#39;d lay here on the beach, water goes over my body so I can live!  But no, you had to push me back in with the shark!!
This is why I go up to my knee caps,turn around n dive towards shore
that was a shark feeding not attacking... stupid click bait
Sorry, aber wenn jemand Attackiert wird, und kurze Zeit sp√§ter, wird wieder jemand Attackiert, dann verstehe ich nicht, warum man die Leute direkt wieder da rein gehen l√§sst, man w√ºrde auch freiwillig nicht mehr da reingehen, manche Menschen gehen trotzdem rein egal was 10 Minuten vorher passiert ist, und das ist Krass manche geben an oder haben keine Angst.
Gd looking girl in the green 2 pieceüëåüòéüòÑ
They are not to be trusted. They will throw you to the sharks.
You shouldn&#39;t have sent that fish to its certain death.  Maybe next time you let it get some oxygen first  to maybe have a fighting chance.  Just my opinion.  Have a day my friend.
Fish- ‚ÄúBruh. You couldn‚Äôt release me into the ocean 20 feet down shore?‚Äù
Yup, you guys should be in Boca Grande Pass during Tarpon Fishing, the Hammerheads can be huge. Trick is to get your Tarpon to shore to have it measured and weighed then turn it loose without fighting Hammerheads and Tigers.
Um ok answer me this for anyone who has been chased by someone or something when your running from whatever it is that is chasing you do you take time to see where your running or do you just run like a bat out of hell and hope you don&#39;t die well that&#39;s what happened here shark chase&#39;s fish fish shits him self and swims like a bat out of hell hoping the hole time he don&#39;t die and not giving a flying fuck where he swims LMAO ü§£ü§™
Title should read &quot;im an idiot for labeling this video&quot;......OR BAD SHARK HUNT DURING THE NIGHT ONLY...
Filmed with a potato camera that had dirt in the view finder.
There&#39;s always a bigger fish.
A Great Hammerhead at that.    Note the very tall a trim dorsal fin.
I&#39;ve seen five foot Black Tip sharks hunting in water less than a foot deep near Cocoa Beach.
Now why did they not just take the fish as a catch. Sending it back was completely idiotic.
Looks like this shark had a tarpon snack
That‚Äôs a hammerhead<br><br>They have a very characteristic tall and narrow dorsal fin.
He was a patient shark, patiently waited for  his dinner then the tarpon swam back out, out of the fry pan into the fire.
those clowns threw the tarpon back into the same location where the shark wasü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ok , a shark caught a fish , is that the attack you are referring to
Outa the pan into the fire. We&#39;ll dam.
Go Sharkie, go!
THEY SHOULD HAVE EATEN  THE TARPON  THEMSELVES ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
DON&#39;T FEED THE SHARKS    - ESPECIALLY  AT THE BEACH ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
SAVE THE TARPON.
Watersports definitely not welcome . . .
The fish was wounded. It was proper to release it back into the sea
This people are stupid especially this blond woman they first look at the fish and do nothing and then they put fish in the sea just for shark to eat it, instead ti wait and take bit further from there!
The same people send the fish to the sea kill the animal to send It to the sea ..just like this  ....waht a stupit reacci√≥n on the people.....
Thanks for nothing !! They should have taken it and released somewhere else. Those dumb tourist literally SERVED the shark it&#39;s meal. WTF !!
Hey that what sharks like!!!!! Northerners‚Ä¶
Yes, help the poor tarpon back into the water so that the shark can get him
The fish is like &quot;yeah, thanks dude, I was happy to die on the beach, but nahhh, you had to throw me back into the slaughterhouse, pffff&quot; what shot day.
Shark is like, thx!!! That a lot!!!
Lol, love how they put the fish back out to its death. ü§£
It&#39;s a hammerhead shark ü¶à Kool
Great Hammerhead.....that‚Äôs dorsal and tail fin is a dead giveaway.
I never thought that i‚Äôd never be able to swim in the ocean.
Hammerhead.
Why thank you. Fine ladies and gentlemen. For making me this sharks lunch. On this beautiful Florida afternoon.
I can tell by the dorsal fin and the top tail fin that is a great hammerhead shark probably about 6 to 7 ft maybe a little longer. It&#39;s amazing to watch them hunting black tip sharks. I grew up in the waters off Florida and I&#39;ve seen some amazing stuff
Esos imb√©ciles al hacer eso ese tiburon llegara siempre a la costa
salvou para morte que sentimento triste ...
You could have ran the fish 200 ft down rhe beach ans put it back in...some pal you are...lol
Just nature at work Sharks need food as well.
This is the reason why I&#39;ve quitted surf when I lived in Florida. To many sharks and as you&#39;ve seen.. right within 20 yrds from shore.
What a gentlemen üòÜ
Better a fish üêü than a human
My bad tarpon!
The shark said thankyou! Gee why are the humans standing right where the shark has easy access to their feet and legs? The shark is not a fussy eater human or tarpin will do!
You sent that fish to his end
So much for trying to save that Tarpon, he was dead rhe second you released it back.
Good one pal ,  Thumbs up and a sub.
Wow.
And they can attack in 3 feet Also Always a shark On the 1st sand bar
hammer head you can tell by the tall dorsal fin. Tarpon are on their menu along with stingray, shark<br> and other assorted seafood.
Great. Y&#39;all killed the tarpon.
Hey, let&#39;s save that Tarpon and help it get back in the deepwater... <br>Holy Shit..... as the severed head of the Tarpon floats back onto shore...<br><br>This reminds me of the video where they found an injured rabbit and nursed it back to health over a week&#39;s time. <br>Then they filmed the release with their children present and as the rabbit started to hoop away, a hawk swoops down and snatches it up, killing it instantly.<br><br><br>By the way, here is a sure-fire test to find out if there are Sharks in the water where you are at.<br><br>1). You reach down and stick your finger into the water.<br>2). You take that finger out of the water and bring it up to your face.<br>3). You then stick out your tongue and touch your finger with your tongue.<br>4). If your finger tastes salty, there are sharks in the water.<br><br>This test has never failed me...<br><br>You&#39;re Welcome...
They come in real close. I&#39;ve seen a shark.   I believe a Lemon maybe.  Came into knee deep water in front of the first lifeguard post just north of Dania Beach pier it was about 6 to 7 feet long.  Lucky the guys on the pier warned us to get out of water
Of course it happened in shallow water. That‚Äôs where sharks feed usually. Most shark attacks happen in &lt;4‚Äô of water.
So once again we have a cameraman who can‚Äôt put the action in the lens. The , to make matters worse, puts a stupid paragraph all over the screen on top of it. <br>I guess we should thank him for at least showing it a second time without the description though. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Hammerhead. Judging by the dorsal fin.
And I  got news for ya.  That was in about 2-3 feet of water, not 5.
WHAT!!! In BROAD DAYLIGHT !!??  Bad Sharkie.  We KNOW you know the RULES.  Attacks ONLY between sunset and sunrise.  So, go to your ROOM ....NOW, (and NO surfers or sardines for you tonight) !!
No good deed goes unpunished ?
That tarpon chose to die by suffocating vs vicious murder, and those people changed it on her. They could&#39;ve at least carried it away from the spot they found it if they were intent on saving it&#39;s life. Sheezuz, lol!
Omg a shark ate another fish. So crazy
I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm from Indiana, but if you see a shark right in front of you throwing a fish Directly in its path wasn‚Äôt too bright people just a thought, lol.
Great Ham-Mammerhead!
Mullet run. Every year
Very stupid people and very nice Ass
They didn‚Äôt save a tarpon, they fed a shark. The fed it at a beach. That wasn‚Äôt very smart.
Are you expecting to see a shark attack someone in the  dark nighttime? Sharks don&#39;t care what time it is. They ear when they are hungry.
Wow ! That poor little fish was marked for death ( no thanks to the humans ) üò≥
Those are not shark ‚Äòattacks‚Äô. Those are sharks feeding, as they must.
Did yall have fun feeding the sharks tarpon
Ignorant tourists fed that shark, morons.
Now why should it not happen in broad daylight, only sleazy people needs darkness
Thought this was a shark attack?
Shark feeding.
Tarpon had a shark on one side, birds from top, humans and seashore from the other side...... damned if you do, damned if you don&#39;t.
Flordia has tiny sharks compared to California
Jeapordized everyone every hang out with one act hitting beach scared away that many tarpon way bigger
Every they know are going eaten by sharks
Going smell them every time go beach
He beached himself for a reason dumbass.
I have never laughed so hard at a videos commentsüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
They threw him back so the shark could finish his attack.<br><br>[TARPON, crying]: Stop ... hold up bruh! Wait ... I&#39;m cool ... Don&#39;t put me back ... not right now ... STOP ... STOP ... STOP!  Holy mother of god, he did it ... I&#39;m dead.  Father forgive them. They know not what they just did to me üò≠
&quot;In broad daylight&quot;...it isn&#39;t a burglar breaking into a house. It&#39;s nature.
Zoom in more next time!
Nice ending, would&#39;ve hated to see the shark go hungry
Idiots, anyone would know that if you put it right back in, it would be attacked and killed!!! <br>Idiots being stupid!
Why in gods name did you throw that poor tarpon back to the shark !!?? Did you need to feel BIG OMG YOU HEARTLESS HEATHENS.
either way the fish is doomed
90% of shark attacks on humans are in 4 ft. of water or less....

No kill sharks, sharks will kill you guys
Sharks are fucking prick&#39;s üò°
Jogaram o peixe para morte .
That guy should have taken the tarpon out a lot farther for a Full experience =))
Wow it‚Äôs a fish being preyed upon by a great hammerhead shark ‚Ä¶. How terrifying ‚Ä¶. Close all beaches.
&quot;Broad Daylight&quot;<br><br>Like sharks eating is a crime üòÇ
Ugh maybe that‚Äôs why the tarpon beached itself hello????
That save wasn&#39;t truly a save, I think it would have rather died from beaching itself!!
Awww the fish probably needed more time to recover from being on the beach it was probably disorientated an landed right in the Jaws gobüòµ
Whoever video this ain&#39;t very good at it
Shark ü¶à attacks real matatan ü¶à ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üëà
Shark says thank you
misleading title.  and &quot;in broad daylight&quot; how very dare they
Great Hammerhead.  The dorsal fin and tail give it away.  Also, targeting tarpon.  14‚Äô and larger beasts are common in those waters.
What a waste. They could have had the fish themselves.
cycle of life: fish escapes death from shark , gets thrown back to certain death by humans, and woman with great ass walks into the picture, does it get any better?
Pretty common actually.
And shark says. Thank you very much. I was wondering how I was gonna get that tarpon
If I saw a shark swimming in front of my view, I would really get out in that place and find another bitch
I fail to see the part where there&#39;s a shark attack.
EU LEVARIA O PEIXE PRA CASA AO INV√âS DE DAR PARA O TUBAR√ÉO.
Hammerheads love their tarpon..lol
Bad day to be a tarpon, and a camera operator too apparently. Poor tarpon either suffocates on the beach or gets thrown back in the sharks jaws by some well meaning tourists. Too bad the camera person can‚Äôt figure out how to point a camera.
Lots of people like to swim in the ocean.  I prefer my inground pool if I want to cool off.  Have fun with it.
Humans help to finish of the Tarpon.  We have large brains for no reason.
i believe thats a juvenile great hammerhead shark, i dont know im not a shark expert but i do alot of research on sharks in my freetime and mainly if you just leave them alone they wont attack, just avoid them because they are very defensive of their food and their prey, if you see on id suggest moving down on the beach but i dont know why this video is making it seem like this shark is like breaking a law and if you breath in its direction itll eat you or smth.
DAM nature you scary!!!
Some say sharks attack in only 5 ft of water the rest of us say sharks eating in 5 ft of water dinner that is.  ü§Øü§Ø
ahh the people saved the tarpon.....NOT!
Sharks are being persecuted by man and we are over fishing the oceans! We are the problem, a wise man once said the world has enough for what we need but not enough for greed
Ya think your safe walkin along the beach at the edge of the water ..Chief... but the shark is in the water and can come in so close it will even beach itself in order to bite you.
Lol &quot;In broad daylight&quot; like they only come out at night or something. They attack whenever they are hungry or feel threatened.
T head...
the birds just instigated the situation the entire time. Lol
I DISLIKED THIS VIDIO BECAUSE I LIKE FISH AND THEY COULD HAVE DONE MORE
Tarpon: Give me to the shark, take me out of my misery <br><br>(People throw him back in)
This fish WAS a tarpon
Hey, I have an a idea: let&#39;s all hover around and look at the fish as some sort of specimen to study as it waits for help. Yeah!
Fish gotta swim. Sharks gotta eat. Mr. Hammerhead?
Looks like a hammerhead
Great hammer head shark
Unknowingly those folk sent that poor Shark to Its Death by helping it back into the Ocean  it was obviously hurt and shielding from the other Predator, Shark The other Shark felt weekness from the Shark and the second it was put back into Ocean was attacked by that other Shark, Predator, Shame The World of pray and Victim continues into the Deep Dark Ocean
Great job !  Lol
Poor tarpon was saved to get right into the jaws! ::((
Somebody put that fish in an oven ffsake
Disappointing. Just like Florida.
WTF ?  I&#39;m trying to beach myself till the shark leave !   WTF these HUMAN&#39;S is doing ?   Stop....Stop....You f*cking dumb *ss HUMAN&#39;S.....Stop !

LOOKS LIKE A DEMOCRAT DID IT TO ME !
Hungry shark + broad daylight = Feeding Frenzy time of day!
looks like a Hammer
Mans having a snack fuck off
Birds love that blood!
Um thats a shark eating not an attack!
Human are cruel for throwing the tarpon right back to the sharks.
Great camera work..
going by the fin,I would say is a hammerhead shark
Shark attacks? How about shark feeding?
I&#39;ve never seen some more stupid people. Tossing such a big fish back in the sea, instead of taking it back home and eatü§îü§îü§£üòÇüòÇüòÖüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÖüî•üî•üî•üî•

This shark clearly wanted the fish.
Thems hammerheads don&#39;t play.
That is a hammerhead I could just tell by how Technical he is is in terms of going after his prey even turn on the drop of a dime.  Skinny long and tall dorsal fin. And that massive tail fin. A great hammerhead.....the smartest sharks in the sea.
Poor tarpon, not really. Put the tarpon back in the water for a shark feast.
Fish : I&#39;ll be safe from shark attack as long as i stay at the shore‚Ä¶<br>Men : Its Shark feeding time~ ü§£ü§£ü§£
Wooow...!
That&#39;s what sharks do....Duh!
Way to go, a-hole.  You just fed the shark a defenseless fish.
Bruh, I&#39;d have had Tarpon for dinner
yaay you just give shark din dins :-)
poor camera person dont know how to aim camera haha
After seeing these I guess many People sold their summar house there in half price.

I would of took the Tarpon and filet it and had fresh fish for dinner...tarpon is great tasting.
And they send the injured fish back out to its deathüò¨
Gee its annoying when people cant use a video camera.
good job, right into the sharks mouth. Stupid idiots
It appears the tarpon had already suffered a fatal bite. The bystanders did the right thing.
Great hammerhead hunting a tarpon. They do that. In other news....
That‚Äôs not a shark attack, it‚Äôs a shark hunting and killing a fish to eat.
They should‚Äôve taken the fish a little further to put it back in the water not the same attack spot shark was waiting
Tarpon for supper! Uh...never mind.
Hammerhead?
Stupid morons should have carried the fish down the beach a hundred feet and then put it in the water,Would have had a better chance of getting away from the shark
Gets it back in the water to save it‚Äôs life only to have an eaten by a shark.
The fish came out of the water to get away and sum stupid idiot pushed it back in to the sea where it was destination Deadsville....
As some want you to remember is is all part of Nature...what did you accomplish by releasing Tarpon back into the water knowing Shark was still in area and now the Shark think this is a feeding ground where Swimmers and bathers are and may be mistaken for food as well...plus Tarpon is a very tasty fish, that would of made a great fresh Fish dinner for 8.
Hammerhead..
Damn guys if you were just gonna feed them to the shark hell you could‚Äôve just cut them up in pieces and throw him out there I think I would‚Äôve walked him down the beach before I put them back in the water to give them a chance
Great seafood, five feet ahead..
That tarpon was probably better off on shore. Was that a Hammerhead?
...fucking shark attack...yeah clickbait.
I once saw a human attack on the beach in broad daylight 5 feet from the water.  Actually it was a kid eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
In BROAD DAYLIGHT?  Can you believe the NERVE OF THAT SHARK!!??!!
Worst camera woman ever...
i just gave his dinner back, hello
Human: I am saturated. Let me handover this fish to shark
shark says , humans are so good the they are going to give it to me
So the humans put the fish back in the water right where the shark is, just so they can get their jollies watching the shark tare it to pieces. I‚Äôm ashamed to be a human.
I like how the title clarifies broad daylight.
Come kids lets go to the beach for a swim!! All those damn sharks should be made to cat food.
Tarpon was fast üí® till..it beached itself a hope he lived  another day ü§£üèÉ
I did see that broad in the daylight though just sayin.
That clip is so old that I expected Jackie Kennedy to appear on it.

Horrifying sun damage on those beachgoers.
Salvation is a gift offered to the world by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, yet people complicate it with religion.<br>Here is a message for lost souls - Jesus Christ is God, manifest in the flesh and He came on earth to die for our sins. He bore our sins on the cross of Calvary. Have you accepted His free gift of Salvation? Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour? Have you truly BELIEVED from your heart that Jesus Christ is LORD? Have you BELIEVED in the death, burial and resurrection found in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 KING JAMES Bible? That&#39;s how a lost soul can get saved.<br><br>Remember that it&#39;s NOT what we do that gets us saved, it&#39;s what Jesus Christ DID on the cross of Calvary, that&#39;s what SAVES a lost soul.<br>All you have to do to be saved, and on your way to heaven is place your TRUST in the shed Blood of Jesus Christ and nothing else, as sufficient for your salvation, (Romans <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j50DAVSH23c&amp;t=205">3:25</a> KJB - &quot;Whom God hath set forth to be a PROPITIATION through FAITH IN HIS BLOOD, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;&quot;)<br>(Propitiation means the act of appeasing wrath, Jesus took your place on the cross.)<br>Will you accept Jesus Christ as your saviour by simple faith, simply trusting in his shed Blood which is sufficient to save your soul from hell?<br>The last sentence is all you must do to be saved, and that is FAITH, not works, TRUSTING in what someone else did for you is the only thing that is not a work.<br>Ephesians 2:8-9 KJB - 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:¬†9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.¬†<br>2 Corinthians 5:7¬†KJB - (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)¬†<br><br>Please get saved NOW before it&#39;s too late for your soul!! There&#39;s 1 Eternity to choose from, Heaven or Hell, choose wisely for your souls!! <br>Grace and Peace to all in Christ Jesus!
The tarpon was trying to beach itself to get away from the shark...it can live for a while like that...but then they shoved it back in the water
Possibly worlds worst videographer.
Never ever go in the ocean
Here you go back in, shark still waiting for you.
Was it in the Atlantic or the Gulf?

the tarpon beached itself to get away from the shark and these twits put it back in the water - the fish can last 20 mins beached like that and get it&#39;s energy back while the shark moves along
Gigantic Bloody Tarpon that was, puts me off swimming ot be honest
Those seagull are even more vicious than shark! they are sea vultures the damn birds!

what a bunch of assholes.
It&#39;s not a shark attack. It&#39;s a shark eating lunch in broad daylight.
The people should have taken the fish 75-100 yards down shore then put the fish in the water
Tarpon:  Phew.  Land.  I&#39;ll just rest here a while until that monster leaves.  What the... put me down, humans.  What the hell?  Don&#39;t put me back in... NOOOO!!!!  BASTARDS!!!

Liberals/Environmentalists can&#39;t handle the Truth...
Feeding sharks near a swimming hole, is this what I&#39;m watching ?...
they save the fish then gets killed by shark ?? what are the odds ??
Ok, folks, this is PERFECTLY normal. Most shark attacks on man occur in 3 feet of water, about 10 ft. from shore, so it follows that anything else in that zone is also on the menu. Yeah, I just ruined your planned beach-swim.
Fish:If i stay here i die from oxygen..If i go back to the water,i die from shark..Can&#39;t get worse!<br>Humans:YOOOOOOO A FISHHHHHHHHH<br>Fish:Fk my life
I didn&#39;t know there was a difference between daylight and broad daylight.  What exactly is &quot;broad daylight&quot;?
stupidity of this guys
Played right into the sharks hands (errrr  fins)
Now it&#39;s in heaven with Harambe.
Broad Daylight? That&#39;s unheard of!! <br>Cuz Normally sharks attack at midnight when it&#39;s dark... üêπ
People saying it&#39;s part of nature . No , natural order would have been humans taking advantage of the sharks misfortune and eating the tarpon themselves .

Yer its not attacking people though....stupid people saw the shark an knew it was still there an threw the fish they in for the shark, should of walked 20m up the beach away from the shark, give it a chance but.i suppose.sharks got to eat too

Cool now you got blood in the water ...lets go swimming pops...<br>Humans so stupid ..got to be a Democrat
We humans we want it all our way........
Absolutely. Another option drag it out and you got a nice meal there hey ? The shark was loitering around out there.  Our so called logic is not in tune with the laws of nature. We save the world but we take it over and impose our own rules on it. We eat meat but the animals only hunt and eat to live. We hunt animals for fun and sport etc. Animals hunt to live. There is a thing called a food chain people.
how many knew they were just throwing the tarpon back to the shark ?
as if sharks wait til evening to do their feeding. when they are hungry (which is 24/7) they eat. Broad daylight folks.
Poor tarpon had a better chance if stayed in shore , thanks to these guys they turned him to a meal to sharks instead of turn him lose. Idiots
Okay so by &#39;attack&#39; you mean feeding on its normal prey.
&quot;was&quot; a Tarpon
I&#39;ve lost the comment. Capital letters. Dialogue between tarpon, people and shark. There were 6 replies, including mine and many likes. Where did he go? Something like: &quot;This shark is trying to eat me.&quot; - and so on. Maybe the author himself deleted it?
Sharks go where the food is. When you go into the water, you go into their kitchen.
I seen bigger goldfish
You morons!
Wow some of these comments.... that fish was resting?......these humans are the worst?.....     First off how incredibly cool to se a Great Hammerhead that close and hunting at that.  The fish was doomed , I would rather the shark get it than the freaking gulls and crabs. The shark worked for it and deserved it lol.  Also nobody&#39;s going to eat Tarpon lol.
Tarpon: Okay i could rest on the shore for 5 minutes for the shark to swim away....<br>Humans: No you don&#39;t
You&#39;re suppose to hold the fish until it is strong enough to swim away. Tarpon was just unlucky that in its time of need, it ran into these people.
Helpful, nature-lovin&#39; folks!
Either way that fish is getting eaten.. By the shark or by me.
One thing I can&#39;t stand! Someone recording and not knowing what the h@#&amp; they&#39;re doing! <br>ZOOM OUT UNTIL YOU LEARN HOW TO TAKE VIDEOS!
Did those idiots  just throw it back in and the shark got it again  !!!!
Tarpon:  &quot;You just threw me back into the jaws of the same shark you fools.&quot;
q perigo, bem assustador meu amigo
They should have called the experts before returning the fish back to the water, the fish pulled himself to safety because PREDATOR IS WAITING, poor thing!
Sorry bro, back into the water with you...dinner awaitsüòÇ
&quot; I know!...I&#39;ll save that tarpon!....what can go wrong?&quot;
Now you know why it is a terrible idea to allow your dogs and kids to swim in the ocean.
High dorsal fin...Hammerhead
Tarpon: I was resting, waiting till he left and you had to throw me back in to him?
That rescue was a fail.
The shark was running the tarpon to eat. The tarpon beached itself to get away from the shark. This is nature. This is what nature does when it lives in the water.  It‚Äôs not a shark attack. Going in the water is their territory.  Stay out of it if you can‚Äôt respect it.  That‚Äôs why I ground pools were developed
I didn&#39;t see any shark &quot;attack&quot;.  I saw a shark eating a fish, which is kind of what they do to survive.  There are sharks around you in the water probably more often than you realize.  They&#39;re really not interested in eating humans.
great Click bait title for 14 m views....REAL title is shark hunting tarpon in 5 ft of water
This looks like it was from 1965
Poor fish!
Daylight eh? Who&#39;d have thought...
Bunch of fat old people  ! (I Think its a fish ?) Yes your right thats a peach hun good one !
I&#39;m sure the shark was grateful for the help....!
I do not like sharks &amp; never will.
So the man puts it straight back in for the shark to eat,.. <br>Me:  take it home and eat.
Never thought I&#39;d see a shark &amp; a fox in the same video...
That one girl with the bikini has a nice ass
Which way to the pool which way to the pool
lol you killed the tarp   lol good dead done dirt cheap  thks from Mr SHARK
&quot;Hey honey, let&#39;s teach sharks that people on this beach will feed them, OK?&quot;<br>&quot;Why, that&#39;s a wonderful idea, sweetie!&quot;
&quot;What kind of fish do you think that is, Harold?&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s a tarpon, Mildred.&quot;  &quot;What?  Do you think it&#39;s going to rain?  I&#39;m going back to the condo for a Manhattan.&quot;
is it great white or other shark?
Stupid people pushed the fish into the water, into the shark&#39;s mouth. Aren&#39;t they idiots ?
Hey, they meant well!
Natura
I wonder how that old man feels shoving it back out there to get killed.... death warrant!
All a shark does is eat and make baby sharks
The only time I caught a Tarpon it got nipped by a 10 foot Hammerhead. He survived thankfully.
Rediculous heading, shark attack in broad daylight. Click bate
I think sometimes people forget that the shark has to live in the water.  We are designed for land.
Yeah...our good deed for the day, helping out a poor beached fish :) Oh...hang on....Bugger!
Now there is one fish that would NOT have been thankful for a helping hand back in the water.
How hard can it be to video
You fucken suck at filming
Nice ass <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j50DAVSH23c&amp;t=55">0:55</a>
In broad daylight ! How dare that shark feed during the day.
Tampon. Oh, thank God I made it safely onto the beach, I was nearly killed !<br>Humans.. Oh, quick, get the Tampon back into the water !!!,üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
Shark : Mayonnaise with my fish. Thanks
Glad I didn&#39;t go in at night when I was in the beach in FLA  .üò®
My thoughts<br>Sharks kill people 1 is 1 to many killed <br>Kill all sharks eat them<br>We then replace them on food chain <br>We become the new predator eating anything they would&#39;ve <br>Nothing changes <br>Feed the poor with surplus sea food

Is there a thin daylight?
Pkoi il bouffe pas des mouettes y en a trop.

The tarpon said nooooo...Don&#39;t save me that way...oh well good bie crude world.üòµüòµüòµüòµ
The tarpon was most likely sick, weakened, or injured in the first place, healthy ones can easily avoid sharks. Not for kids? It&#39;s not like it&#39;s some kind of bloody massacre, kids see more violence in a 1/2 hour sitting in front of the idiot box. This is more educational.  Thumbs down for the goofy, over hyped title.
That girl ain&#39;t got no ass
So sharks live in the ocean and also eat during daylight hours. FASCINATING. Tell me more.
This is not a shark attack - this is just the sharks way to play chasing sticks with humans!
Anyone know what kind of shark that was ?
asshole
Just a hammerhead shark. Not concerned with the humans at all. Looking for fish to eat.
Broad daylight ? So does this mean that most shark attacks occur at night ?
&quot;Hey don&#39;t throw me back, there&#39;s a shark in there you ahole. Wait a minute, Are you working with him? are you in cahoots with that jerk? Whatever he&#39;s paying you I&#39;ll double it not to throw me back.&quot;
Poor Tarpon üò¢üò¢üò¢‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
you idiots feed it to death lol, thats life
the title &quot;shark attacks in broad daylight...&quot; do you mean sharks usually should attack at night?
Totally un cool the tarppon fish was geting away from,the shark,and these stupid. Humans set it t o its death !
Sharks are like sex offenders, can‚Äôt trust them.
It was a lose-lose proposition for the tarpon.
It was a hammerhead attacking a tarpon. I am from Florida and have seen this before. You can tell it&#39;s a hammer by how tall it&#39;s dorsal fin is. And tarpon are high on it&#39;s list of things it eats
A 2 minute 14 second long video and he covers up the first 13 seconds with a BS writing we already know. How hard is to stay focused on the subject matter? Can I see more video of the empty water? I must be dumb because if I see a shark, 5 ft from shore, I&#39;m not about to put a fish in the water where it will become lunch for the shark, when it is safe where it is. It was being covered with the waves and was in less danger than being feed to the shark. Jimmy Cricket let nature take care of itself. The fish was being washed back into the water, no need to help it. Those idiots must have been from Okla?  lol
Yes because sharks wait until night to attack you... üôÑ
out of the frying pan into the fire
As opposed to sneaking up at night!
Welcome to Florida.... now please return home.
Aww someone should of ran the fish  down a few hundred feet and then let it go to give it a chance.
The shark needs to eat like the rest of life pity it was a awesome looking fish
In broad daylight?! Bs. Jaws only attacks during full moon by night.
There you go little fishy, hey what&#39;s that red in the water?
Chicks in Bikini
Sharks have to eat too
Why did nobody fillet that thing and have a sweet ass lunch?? It&#39;s literally fresh from the sea!!!
Wish libtards were their favorite food
Did someone say that sharks only eat at night? Did someone say that sharks only swim in very deep waters? Where? Does somebody have a link?
Next: China invades Taiwan IN BROAD DAYLIGHT!.........
That is almost like something out of FamilyGuy.
I personally know that shark in the video.  Small world
Since when did sharks start attacking in broad daylight?<br>I always thought that they attacked under the cloak of darkness. (;

Looks like a small hammerhead by the tall dorsal fin. They love tarpon!

Next time, if you to save the tarpon, walk with it a few meters down the beach and then toss it back. They threw it right into the waiting jaws of Jaws!
Well done, guys. The correct and humane thing to do - Tarpon was fatally injured already, and this was the hungry shark did not bite anyone.<br><br>Everyone‚Äôs a Winner.

Shark attack? You mean shark catches and eats fish. In the sea. Where it lives. Both in daylight and when it&#39;s darkü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If a human caught up hay tarpon they would be considered a ‚Äògreat fisherman‚Äô or even a tarpon ‚Äòexpert‚Äô. However, if a shark hunts down and kills any ocean creature it‚Äôs a monster!!!!!!! Where or how do you think sea creatures survive? McDonalds don‚Äôt exist underwater.  <br><br>That tarpon was mangled &amp; sure to die. If not eaten by the shark - apex predator - then surely by the seagulls and or crustaceans. That‚Äôs how nature works. Get over your hypersensitivities.
In Broad Daylight! lol
anyone who has ever took fishing seriously ,knows,that large fish always feed at the water line,that&#39;s where the little fish congregate ,humans are just dumb and are enjoying their day in shark infested waters,stupid, just doesn&#39;t do the situation justice
Swimmers.... Just be alert...
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT???????? Umm, Yes! Sharks swim during the day and during the night. Sharks also Eat at any time of the day. The title is a little misleading. I did not see any Sharks &quot;Attacking&quot; anyone. I did see Sharks Feeding.
L
Always check the water /sea before you enter no matter where it it is or how deep it is ! !
It&#39;s called feeding
I clicked because i saw ass in a bikini üòÅüò§üò§üò§

Lol since when is a shark, eating a fish in the ocean, considered a &quot;shark attack&quot;?? Shark is doing what shark does....smh
Happens thousands of times a day.  Every day.  It&#39;s the ocean.
They sent the tarpon to a sad destiny.
Is that a hammerhead shark ?

Little more than 5 feet
If they only knew how many sharks just swim right on through their legs....there are more sharks on the east coast than people I believe.  They are everywhere and never really have any human interaction, now you put a stinky piece of bait on the bottom and that&#39;s a different story, you&#39;ll catch sharks until your arms bleed.
Fuc the shark
those assholes just fed that shark the snook they should of waited to send him
How brilliant to cover up the footage I clicked to see with words.  Annoying and dopey.

Did the shark killed a Fish?
Hahahaha...just when the tarpon though it‚Äôs safe for him, came this man and throw him back straight to the shark mouth,  and then you see the tarpon face as he leaves half of his body in the shark mouth,what a bad luck for that fish

<b>thanks guys that was delicious please let me sharke your hands or those shiny thunder thighs to show my appreciation</b>
Florida has a lot of coastline, that&#39;s one reason why it is the shark-attack capital of the world.  It is also near a migrating route for some sharks.  The Bull and the Tiger are the most dangerous sharks in that area, but some reef and sand sharks have also been responsible for a few bites.  There are not more shark bites there in the last few decades, but there are many more people in the water to get bitten!  That&#39;s why the rise in bites.<br>Migrants have brought the population growth of Florida up 375,000 this past year!  And since it is warm there, people WILL go to the beach for relief, hence more shark bites!  Now, Florida is called the &quot;shark-bite capital of the world&quot; but that is mostly because the more people in the water, the more chances of shark bites.<br>Couple that with the fact that humans are TEACHING sharks that where there are humans, there is food, with resorts that cage-dive while chumming with blood and guts to draw sharks in, some places have spots where divers can go out, set up on the bottom with bait fish and feed sharks!  Sharks are not dumb, animals learn quite rapidly that where there is a food source, they will go back to that area repeatedly!  So thank your human, shark-watching friends for the increase in shark bites!
probably a mullet run that brought in sharks and tarpons
Sharks dont play tbey are efficient and priceless leave them.alome
Damn they sentenced that fish to die and put blood in.the water to attract more sharks. Should&#39;ve pulled him out or ran him down the beach to give him a chance to get away.  I only say that to keep the sharks from hunting back around that spot
That was a nice hammerhead shark!
Que poca madre, se lo fueron ellos al tibur√≥n!!!
In 2018 ...57,375 men, women and children were shot and killed in the USA by Americans....yet people fear sharks??? Wake up

There are a number of shark species around Florida but bull sharks are the most feared; they are territorial, can be aggressive, especially on the east side like the New Smyrna Beach area.  If you see birds diving out there into the water, it means bait fish are there and they are the shark&#39;s natural prey.  Don&#39;t go in if you see that!  Also, sharks like to feed in areas where river mouths have food washing down into the ocean.

ok so when sharks bite fish, it&#39;s eating and when they bite Humans...it&#39;s an attack.  Hmm
People are mean
Thats why i dont get in the Ocean. We r bottom of the Food Chain in Saltwater
I think we should encourage risky behaviors on the sly because our population is destroying our home
Where exactly was the shark attack? That shark was chasing and then eating it&#39;s lunch.
SHARK SAYS &quot;THANKS folks for helping me get my dinner.  YOU&#39;RE DESERT&quot;
5 feet? I don&#39;t think so..
Sharks eating in the ocean?<br>You jest
Shark didn&#39;t even wear a mask or gloves! Brazen! Daylight attack, WOW... roflmao!
That tarpon would of gone on the open Bbq, beach style my friend, not back inda water...for sure!!

Seriously would anyone else just take that fishy home and cook it for themselves?
de verdad que la gente no puede ser mas idiota, no pod√≠an haber cogido al pobre pez y meterlo en otra zona al agua, mirando al tiburon esperando y se lo dan.  o simplemente ir ech√°ndole agua hasta que se fuese el tibur√≥n.
The fish at shore was being stalked by the shark and was a death sentence for them to throw him back in where the shark was.
More girls in bikinis please......  no sharks.
god bless them! It did my heart good to see the shark eat up the fish they saved!
The shark wanted a little help. And he was helped..

üòÇ I think you pissed off that fish
Yulp,I&#39;ll stick to the pool.
Shark Attack?  The shark was HUNTING HIS FOOD. Idiots!
That&#39;s what he was after.. the lunch on the beach... take it out into the water so the shark can have lunch...dam it he was just wanted to play Marco Polo and y&#39;all are afraid... shame on you for hurting the sharks feeling
Why didn&#39;t they take the fish further down if they wanted to save itüòÇüòÇ

It‚Äôs not an ‚Äúattack.‚Äù It‚Äôs nature.
Quick, throw all the fat chicks in.
it&#39;s a shark and that is what it does to eat  you idiots
Sorry tree huggers. The only good sharks are dead ones. Obliterate them with my blessing.
I would have run it up the beach about 200 feet to give it a chance.
Welcome to Florida! Don&#39;t feed the fish! Lol
Nice place 2 swim!!!!!
Shark: &quot; tuhh, would you mind trow my lunch back in the wather.?....thank you &quot;

Booty is a 6 out of 10.  Cool shark attack too.
Poor fish I wonder what he was saying please don&#39;t put me back let me stay here knowing that dam shark was waiting on his ass to come back.and the humans like we put you back too die with Honor and dignity of the sea .so either way the fish was dead either he returns to the sea or not because that shark wasn&#39;t going anywhere .taste of blood
Nature says humans take that fish and eat but noooo we are smart and again against nature... c c c STUPID humans! C c c
A shark eating a fish ..NO WAY!
Why didn&#39;t they carry the poor fish down the shore away from the shark and then release it?
Hammerhead
fuckin idiots
Game Wardon see someone walking to put tarpon in ocean distance from shark. Game Wardon says you got a licence- no you get a ticket. Oh it out of season there another ticket. Oh it under size have a third ticket. You trying to protect it from the shark. What shark, there is sharks everywhere it survival of the fittest out there. And you got a very expensive date with the judge. Them putting the fish back in was the only thing that could be done.
Suffocation or eaten alive...¬† pretty sure I would prefer to suffocate....
Great Hammerhead
I hope yous feel guilty
This is why there are POOLS . Beach , water = Shark . Not good .
THE DEBILS!
WHY nobody took that fish? against the law? It is very tasty full.
See what happens when humans think?
What a terrible choice.  The tarpon suffocates or you send it to its death in the water.  Sad!

Tarpon wasn&#39;t anticipating getting thrown back to the shark..I willing to take a guess when he looked back he said a few choice words to the man
Not an attack. It‚Äôs natural. Sharks domain. And they feed day and night.
Seems real. Nothing fake.
I wonder if you are allowed to keep and eat a nice deliscious prescious fish if you just happen to fi d one chillin&#39; on the beach? F the shark, daddy&#39;s bringing home supper baby!
In broad daylight shock horror... yawn
The tarpons like &quot;hey people I&#39;m ok  here on the beach..if someone wants back in, you go ahead&quot;
What idiots . The fish was clearly trying to get away and they just through him back .
Hammerhead.
It was stuck ashore anyway. Regardless that&#39;s nature. Shit gets eaten and brutally torn apart everyday. Just be happy we sit on top of the food chain.
Are we so far removed from nature that a shark feeding is demonized ??  I have seen more needless  vicious attacks on buffets by humans to be honest.
Click bait, it NOT a shark attack at all.
worst videographer on the planet
Yes stuff that.
Remember sharks swim eat and make baby sharks.  The tarpin was probilly sick or injured.  Sharks doing what it is suppose to do.
thanks to men the pour fish was helped from a certain death to a certain death‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
Sharks are a natural part of the coastal ecosystem that were there long before people were slinging beach blankets and putting on speedos. In the end those sharks are part of a natural system in the ocean - people are not.
Hammerhead?
I‚Äôm the same way. I‚Äôve often went to Albertsons in broad daylight as well. Nobody threw a fish my way though... but I did notice a 12 pack of Bud Lt try to get away from me as I approached it..... sneaky little fuckers.

Drama queen title . The shark is doing what we do every day..EATING .  Crappy title .

Funny how you label this as ‚Äúin broad daylight ‚Äú.   Like this shark was committing a crime or something.   Also most all shark attacks happen in very shallow water
&quot;In broad daylight&quot; as if sharks give a fuck about what time of day it is lmao
this is why I don&#39;t swim in the ocean, sharks
OMG get the fish back in the water
And the producer/director was good with the titling superimposed over obviously relevant action footage...... like Fox and their &quot;breaking news&quot; real-time footage stomped all over by the scrolling headlines and stock exchange tickers, network ID, other breaking news, maybe some advertising, what the Hell..... throw in some weather in major cities of the world and leave a little room for some more advertising, on a bottom edge banner that blocks the very subject of the broadcast...... and not just a few times.

Florida shark eats a meal
That fish was like leave me alone people please don&#39;t try to help,,,dub asses,
I had at least 50 people saying sharks don&#39;t eat people,I&#39;m a bad person for saying kill all the sharks,,,I hope this was one of those people ,,
got the split second bikini in the thumbnail!¬† you&#39;re a future marketing genius
Hey here&#39;s a shark attack while I zoom in too close and move the camera around like a washing machine. Then I&#39;ll film the sand on the beach for good measure
These sharks are getting bolder and bolder every year. This particular nut job  thought it would be OKAY to hunt and eat &quot;in broad daylight&#39;!
still waiting for the shark attack and video finished. i did see a fish beach its self-escaping the shark. but didnt see any attack
What?  Sharks eating in the daytime?  How dare they....
They should get the fish.. and eat it...hehe
what kind of shark is it?  a reef or a bull maybe?
should of fed the camera person to the shark! horrible camera work!
I wish they would stop calling these ‚ÄúSHARK ATTACKS‚Äù do you go to your kitchen and get food and say ‚Äúhuman attack‚Äù Sharks live in the ocean, that‚Äôs their kitchen, you enter their kitchen, you just might end up on the dinner plate!
Feeding time at the beach! Chomp chomp!
hammerhead
&quot;Ja, er hat ihn&quot;.  Ze Germans!
help?  or  kill???
Come on help me feed the sharky!
The shark was just fishin&#39;....................
Clearly the tarpon ate the shark.
That was awesome
It‚Äôs called feeding
So they killed the fish lol
bad fish swallow you whole little shaking a little tenderizing down you go
Looks like Tarpon was on the menu?
What an absolute moron.  &quot;In broad daylight&quot;, as if sharks only eat at night?  Sharks eat fish and guess what, 5 feet from shore is still the ocean.  That belongs to the shark.  Fact is, if you have ever been in the ocean chances are good that a large shark, or 12, have come within 3 ft of you and yet you were not eaten.
Carry the fish down the beach and put back in the water.
IDIOTS!üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
I think the fish went to shore on purpose. To avoid jaws.
Hammerheads fish in all depths. But good call on freeing that tarp he lived a long life
El pez prefer√≠a morir ahogado, sab√≠a lo que le esperaba en el agua
Shark attacks in broad daylight we the audacity
Better tittle Idiots feed a shark in broad daylight...
Shark attack?  A shark was eating a fish, a natural feeding behavior.  That is not an attack.  Also &quot;broad daylight&quot; LMFAO - yeah, sharks and fish eat during the daylight hours.  <br><br>Yanks are so stupid.
I&#39;d have taken that tarpon home for din din.
He throws the Tarpon to its death, lol.  Oops.
I often by tarpons when I‚Äôm on my period.
Que povo idiota! Devolveram o peixe que foi devorado! Dando id√©ia ao tubar√£o que ali tem comida f√°cil! Na pr√≥xima tomara que morda a bunda seca desses idiotas!
‚òπÔ∏è
WOW NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN SAY THEY FEED A SHARK  ORGANICALLY !!
What&#39;s up with the hand sticking out of the water around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j50DAVSH23c&amp;t=99">1:39</a> ?
poor tarpon
&quot;–î.–ë!&quot;(—Å)
Instead of saving the fish on the beach, people killed it by pushing back to water. Probably it did try to save itself by jumping out of water and land on the shore.
Saved his life. Oh, wait
Tourists:(
Very distinctive dorsal fin .that&#39;s a hammerhead and the bastards probably between 12 and 14 ft lunching at a beach full of swimmers.this is why I always get a creepy feeling I&#39;m not alone when in the waters of florida
O peixe fugindo do predador jogaram ele pro tubar√£o de volta üò´üò´
The things people do for entertainment. The release of the tarpon was 100% for the footage, terrible shaky out of focus footage!
Well at least one fish was happy.
Each video I have seen shows the birds hanging around the shark waiting for leftovers, I‚Äôd say if you see them get the hellmout of there !
horrible camera man!
I am pleased that people and sharks try to get on  remember they were around a lot longer than us humans  we should respect them more A they are beautiful things
lose a good dinner
Hell, if tarpons are tasty, somebody should have grabbed it up. It was as good as dead any way you looked at it, so you might as well fry ‚Äòem up! LOL!!!
Stupid. The Tarpon beached itself to get away from the shark. Happens all the time. These people must have been snowbirds. Ugh!
Yepp, Sharks do Shark Things üòäthats Live
Very bad filming when you put words over the part of the attack where no one can see!!  Stupid
Sharks don&#39;t wait untill it&#39;s dark  outside to attack lol
if you didnt fish near the swimmers things like this wouldnt happen, you dummies!use your brain!
how is this an attack? more like shark feeding on fish like they normally do
Was it wounded?  If so, I might have been tempted to take it home . . . and eat it!
Nobody&#39;s &quot;fault&quot;, just nature playing out as it does every hour of every day. The people were obviously well-meaning, and probably had no idea the shark was even near the beach. Besides, if the fish had it&#39;s choice, I&#39;m pretty sure it would rather be quickly eaten than to lie on the beach in the sun, unable to breath, for God knows how long.
Why would they throw it back to the shark? Lol coupke dudes should pick it up an carry it down the coast line away from where it washed up at. Might as well left it to suffocate on shore. He purposely beached himself to git away from shark.
DID ANY OF YOU EVER READ YOUR COMMENTS, THIS IS WHY THE COUNTRY IS LIKE IT IS BRAIN DEAD.
this is the ocean and it is there home.
Dumbasses should have grabbed a fishing pole and caught that shark. Would have been a nice catch.
Enjoy your swim everyone when you going swimming in the ocean they&#39;re are predictors all around you that you don&#39;t see
Nice hineys
Stupid animal lovers..here go get. Killed a violent death instead..whatever
Great footage. Thanks for sharing!
The shark put all the work into this meal so let the shark eat.
Hammerheads LOVE tarpon
In broad daylight? Like the sharks give<br>A bleep
Weird my tape measure says it wasnt 5 feet from shore
Natura triste!
We are poisoning the oceans so much that deadly predators now eat in shallow areas, were swimmers and bathers tend to hangout. When I was younger, about 40+years ago you never saw or heard about sharks being so close to shore. Years ago you had to travel to Cape Cod for possible sightings of sharks in the water after the seals that migrate to the cape every years. Sure attacks did happen but in much deeper waters.
in broad daylight how dare that shark....
That was nice the poor fish was save
That was rude.
Fins look like a hammerhead.
Hammer head
Sharky the Shark says thank you for assist, Ill spare ya a bite next time your in my waters
Definitely a hammerhead. They love tarpon.
THEY PITCHED THE FISH BACK OUT ONLY TO BE EATIN
why not release the fish away from the sharks?
Poor tarpon, you just fed him to the shark. Feel good about yourselves now?
Haha , reading comments on youtube is better then any standup..
I know I&#39;m not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree,but I wouldn&#39;t have thrown that tarpon in if I had any hope to swim the rest of my vacation lolüå¥
Based on the look of that dorsal fin I&#39;d say it was a hammerhead. But I could be wrong.
So did the people put the fish back in the water to save it or feed it to the shark? ü§î
i thought they meant it bit a human lol
Circle of life
Nice hammerhead
And the shark thank you for &quot;rescuing&quot; the tarpon right?
people are dumb never learn! cant figure why swimming in polluted shark water is dangerous! your freaking idiots the worlds better off without your ignorance to spread! if you people just knew what the navy ships dump in ocean everyday!
Ever since &quot;JAWS&quot; came out -- I haven&#39;t been in the water.
Did the shark even say thank you?!
I lived in Lauderdale for 30 years and never saw such a thing while there. The shark ran the tarpon aground and the tide wasnt high enough to go in and get it. &quot;Thanks &quot;to those guys he did however! Dolphins do this all the time. Those guys could have had a great meal but they gave it to the shark! üò≥
Do sharks only attack at night?
Type of shark anyone? I&#39;m guessing hammerhead!
The fish tried to die by suicide on it&#39;s own terms knowing it was going to be eaten.
Please feed the stupid and unhelpful fuckers that couldn&#39;t help the Tarpon to the shark, we don&#39;t need people like that on this earth!
Lol I love how you say broad daylight like these things only happen at night lol
That bird&#39;s all like, &quot;I&#39;ll take the leftovers please, thanks!&quot;
a tasty fish! hello dinner! awww ! they fed it back to the shark.
shit
Why not take it back yourself for the bbq?

Dam nature you scary!
Not so much an &quot;attack&quot; as it was just eating. Seeing the words &quot;shark attacks&quot; leaves readers/viewers to believe a person had been attacked. Whereas it was nothing more than a shark eating the food it had caught. It&#39;s what happens in nature.
Yeah why not feed the shark right there in shore so next time its gona come and grab a kid..

Shark: humans give me back my hostage or i&#39;ll tell on you to Poseidon and we will see if you ever gonna  swim here again
.
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT!!! YES BECAUSE NORMALLY THEY ATTACK IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT WITH A MASK ON!
Tall dorsal fin of a hammerhead I think. They are known to feed close to shore on all types of fish, skates and rays!!
You eat at the beach, why can‚Äôt the shark?
5 feet from shore? People need to get a better grasp of distance.
....sigh
The shark wasn&#39;t attacking. It was feeding.
Stupid! You do not put back a fish in the water like this. You are teasing the shark, as nature would not have done. Moreover, it is dangerous for the swimmers cause the shark will come back because you stupidly help it getting food! NO IQ!
broad daylight?! did it at least wear a disguise?
The sharks gave them dinner.... And they threw it back.... üò± so they kept it for themselves
Them old tarpon make some really good cut bait
Proprio  stupido quel signore  ha salvato lo squalo
Most shark attacks are in 3 - 5 ft of water at dusk and dawn.
Throw it back in
What stupid editing is this ~ Writting across the actual attack video and then a mauled Tarpon laying on its side on the sand .... PFFFF !!! MY 5 year old could have done better BLIND FOLDED !!!!
They should&#39;ve just cooked the fish.
FRIUTCAKES
Here you go you&#39;ll be alright kno....doooh!
How ed that plan work out üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The people did the right thing by putting the tarpon back in the water. It&#39;d have died on the beach anyway. The sharks and their prey have been playing this game for millions of years, this time the shark won. Same thing on the African continent between the lions and their prey... It&#39;s simply nature at work!
Caught by the devil, too far from the deep blue sea. A ruined idiom folks.
since when do sharks only attack at night?
The shark eat the fish in beach. very crazy.
Shark said to the fish rescue committee:<br>&quot;Why the sad look? .... I left a tip.&quot;
Ha thanks for saving me and tiring me into the sea for shark food lol
People feed the shark his meal, not save the Tarpon.<br>Thats why Animals are smart and a lot People not.<br>Learn to think. Lol
Bitch learn to film
WTF...THIS BUT..IS ..UGLY..DAME
Shark not attacking.....it&#39;s feeding....we all do it. Millions of sharks get killed every year for no particularly good reason. ....
Why would u put the text over the clip?
We did our good deed we save a fish oops what the shark eating
they send tarpon back to his doom ..
That&#39;s Not an attack. It&#39;s called &quot;Having Lunch.&quot;
why feed the sharks fucking idiots feed yourself it committed suicide to avoid shark so you could eat it!!!what dumbfucks must be veg heads! thanks for feeding the sharks
You guys watch the Tarpon while I help the mermaid.
NO HOMO....
I wouldve ran the tarpon a good 100 yards from the shark fast af and then put it back.
