Earthquake ? Back desk . Thanks japan . people build ridiculous building ? probably take twenty fucking minute ride elevator top . Nishi-Shinjuku shot high floor Shinjuku Center Building . first building Nomura Building . curvy shaped one immediately right Sompo Japan Building . Towards end video see i-Land Tower left . many comment pointed , building designed sway earthquake . sound horrifying planet Japan scary ... nice video title watch much juju beat dance feel horrible people building , must & # 39 ; terrifying . : think California take lesson want keep building higher taller . Keio South Tower ; sibling Keio Plaza hotel ? original plaza hotel first high rise hotel Japan , tallest building Shinjuku , Japan , 1971 taller structure built next 1974. movement caused wind Malaysian skycraper ( Twincle pencil ) best ingeneering . creepy guy said & quot ; awesome begginning & quot ; XDD would cry see building swaying Earthquake , & # 39 ; good thing . usually mean & # 39 ; got sort anti-Earthquake foundation cause move motion Earth instead resisting . skyscraper designed sway like prevent colapse & # 39 ; weird building video made & # 39 ; moving & # 39 ; cool & quot ; Earthquake make skyscraper dancing. & quot ; OoooKAY !

Shit . r u still taking video . run bitch run ! ! ! ! ! thats called Japan ? LOOL lel lol LOLZ Turkish Japanese Earthquakes : fake building designed sway earthquake region safety instead collapsing force , designed maximum deformation snapping completely Hi get message ? Please use video educational film school tectonics student studying physic ? credit send copy DVD . Please let know ASAP . Many thanks Alexis Pumpkin Interactive . ... tower , many , many pant shat day ... Cool ! building able jiggle ? many people wear dust mask Japan ? ! WOW that´s incredible Japanese best engineer thank sharing . Nevermind : ) : ) & # 39 ; see move : ( : ( : ( actually designed , based earthquake , dont fall , look , meant Structural Engineer building move subjected lateral load like wind earthquake . actually much safer tall building short 4 5 story building . 4 5 story likely fall tall building harmonic resonance earthquake . also depends greatly supporting foundation material . also building sexy California advance earthquake engineering building look sexy would shart pant ! Impressionante show people make lazy Play 2x speed , woooow θαυμαζω την φοβερη αρχιτεκτονικη τους. ! japan normal someone explain advanced building US ? Would worse building remained stationary earthquake ? would think maybe would better absorb shock ... sure exactly . WELCOME FUTURE .. < br > JAPAN 2020 .. Oh god .. & # 39 ; alive ! ! U.S. building built advanced , even California extraordinary civil engineering . Japanese would little ... unnerved . cool , leave Japanese man , accomplish . like engineering run blood . never going lol & # 39 ; care earthquake proof building , would & # 39 ; fly downstairs like tomorrow Nowdays thats make skycrapers .... earthquake happends flex dont get destroyd fall apart ... holy shit designed flex , keep crumbling . shaking camera guy laughing , mkay . Japanese sen humour , guess ! im sure bet inside building swaying scary fuck ! sky scraper gon na fall mean look side side dance engineering , architecture science work . Unlike idiot Americans , Japanese invest thing related stupid shit like jesus trillion dollar tax break church . Notice , people & # 39 ; screaming & # 39 ; god & # 39 ; non-sense . technology side . Right Japan ! Right . filming earthquake 50th floor laughing time ? steel ball . skyscraper engineered take earthquake earthquake prone area . skyscraper New York & # 39 ; withstand earthquake like say Seattle skyscraper would due fact & # 39 ; made withstand one , & # 39 ; cause & # 39 ; earthquake prone area . . would dropped deuce right ... swag , sway . skyscraper taller 100m withstand force even airplane impact , WTC withstand unfortunately PURPOSELY blown government . top building designer architect know , unless got paid million spread bullshit history channel . think misunderstood comment , thought saying apart Japan UK building withstand earthquake 10.0 . nevermind earthquake UK , bitch please & # 39 ; cocky . country accepted kind earthquake engineering newer sky scraper . Using technique Japanese apparently UK brings ability stand earthquake Japanese UK . Ohh fuck Good , & # 39 ; sway , pressure tension would cause havoc upon structure . whole tsunami hidden-Godzilla attack ? America try make construction cheap possible , like drywall steel column reinforced concrete , really & # 39 ; need make building super strong , country like Japan earthquake . Bands make em dance скрип , как в подводной лодке в & quot ; Periscope & quot ; building base isolated designed .... however building camera pointing swaying one cameraman ! Ахиреть . design actually come built pagoda . Rather central pillar set ground , & # 39 ; instead left free-standing first floor top -- subsequent floor & # 39 ; directly attached , rather hole cut around & quot ; lean & quot ; . skyscraper generally 4 pillar -- pillar stand still , floor free move side side absorb energy w/o falling . crazy thank info lol , & # 39 ; already realised three tower went 911 & # 39 ; plane . Physicists architect proved impossible fall zero resistance without & quot ; help & quot ; . obviously & # 39 ; know really happened apart medium told . building well constructed could withhold many plane . & # 39 ; leave . , , research . like , taping ! ! would sh * * * ! ! ! know designed , got ta sort damage structure . idea ? excellent top building , swaying like , building & # 39 ; fall kill . & # 39 ; die heart attack . 8 ( Slide left . Slide right . bring back & # 39 ; . Holy shizz ! ! Would crap ! harlem shake OH HELL BITCH IM LOL Actually , earthquake suspension system building western engineering . left left loved Japan since found ULTRAMAN / Johny Soko child . amazing work engineering japanese amazing people look fun Japanese engineering finest : ) Hatalmas kőbogyókon állnak az épületek , náluk nem fog romba dőlni semmi ! holy shit creeking sound make much creepier .. engineering best reason , watching building sway , kept expecting building bust Transformer style . LOL . much Hollywood . pretty amazing construction . Impressive . would like .... ill pot .... Apparently many building Japan built atop shock absorber move quake , therefore lessening structural damage building . course mean increased chance shit flying everywhere inside building , & # 39 ; better thing coming . popo time well nice toknow good building true supposed : sway . Thats good building dumb Mother god ... tower would fetal position cry like baby asian . spent next three night 10th floor hotel rock n roll every aftershock . north choice staying inside risk dying collapse staying outside dying hypothermia snow . end day one lucky one , severely inconvenienced unhurt home come back . Actually need look design WTT & # 39 ; nearly immediately surprised engineer architect actually designed tower fully capable standing impact multiple commercial airliner ... . building arent fire half structural support destroyed middle either .... building ! spring holding & amp ; job quiet well ! Good thing make em flex nowadays holy shit Yup , & quot ; 911 & quot ; colloquially referred world trade center building 1 2. designed withstand impact low speed 707 . ultimately failed heavier 767 large fuel amount available . Plus , could trust engineering late 60 ? U G wonder picked UK example obvious hate ... pretty much apart Japan , skyscraper country withstand powerful earthquake scale 10.0 911 one . Los Angeles . japanese ... mass damper ? thats crazy & # 39 ; actually ! Lots building Japan designed like . Instead fighting earthquake , making building fall , swayed , causing le damage . take video right ? please contact asap viola @ gps.caltech.edu WTC 1/2 almost bunker , able withstand 3/4 plane Architect told medium , mainstream medium broadcasting channel newschannels course tell u lie , many & # 39 ; know truth . live Costa Rica . country frequently earthquake . long ago 7.6 earthquake 2 people died 4 house completely damaged . Although may cool tech like Japan , building made survive kind earthquake . Every single house building survive made move & quot ; dance & quot ; like one video . & # 39 ; huge deal . wow , tech day fuck . . america built like live brisbane weve never far know never even tremor earthquake WIDESCALE DESTRUCTION look inland tsunami 1 Question , cameraman still focus & amp ; shaky ? これも初見だ、凄い！ Shows bullshit 9/11 official explanation , especially WTC7 . & # 39 ; actually difficult demolish high rise . built many time stronger need . & # 39 ; care . go Tokyo ? Please ? Tokyo awesome drug . & lt ; 3 Fuck lol building built 30 year ago . Id pissing pant xD built like japan 11 year ago ...... 9/11 & # 39 ; bad ! building done party rock Shuffle building dance ! ! ! Shhhh ... SHALL DANCE ! ! would shit . earthquake happened Beijing China , skyscraper would collapse . Watching building swaying like making seasick . structure built resist earthquake shock . dont think structure world built resist airline crashing . Dont hard : ) please explain fall building Nr . 7 ! plane hit , & quot ; terrorist & quot ; touched . one ( real ) Terrorist said & quot ; Pull ! & quot ; , watched building collapse . Stupid comment . guarantee 737 filled fuel hit building & # 39 ; coming . failure WTF building load loss due heat steal melting . & # 39 ; dumb argument building usually designed based location terrorist attack . there difference building collapsing earthquake one explosion melting steel beam cause one collapse . wulda Se esse terremoto fosse aqui Brasil , o ladrões iriam entrar na casas vazias e roubar tudo que pudessem carregar ... pessoas desesperadas na ruas , seriam assaltadas . Brasil , quando há calamidades , como sêca , cheias de rio , enchentes , incêndios e queimadas florestais , o ladrões deitam e rolam , roubam tudo ... portanto estrangeiros , fiquem bem longe Brasil , aqui é país mais ou menos , do ladrões e da corrupção política e pública . Na Copa Mundo vocês verão ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! punchline ? Something called engineering economic demand dared . lived japan 4 year engineering unbelievable . amazing work create . actually think instead worrying look . arigato Omg , would even dare build high earthquake zone ? ? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhggghhhhhhhhhh scare hell . already problem height , , & # 39 ; run downstairs exit . one word : MadeInJapan earth moving , way make building fall , make go opposite direction earth & # 39 ; movement , would scary . joke ! sturdy architecture . contractor job . guy top & # 39 ; hate Job & # 39 ; . one building , would scared life . & # 39 ; already afraid height . would make ten time worse . YEE RECTEN DISPENSER ! ! ! Wait minute ... SPY SAPPING SENTRY ! taken far informative ; ) Ooookay ... creepy ! fucccckkkkkkkkk scaryyy shitt hauhauahuah , thing came tru head lol would freaky totally scare death . seriously ... FUCK , would dwn stair fast quake would still going Nope . Rollers , basically . whole building designed shift around complex roller mechanism permit movement direction , including circular motion . building also built flexible , absorb energy motion rather coming apart . Japan really good , since modern nation major earthquake risk . US , , place like California . 0:46 EVERYBODY DANCE ! o_o look sign building lol & # 39 ; going back forth well . put , NOPE allready top comment lol . FUCKIN crazy soo put hydraulics building ? feel safe , earthquake give quite adrenaline rush oh shit , Oh Shit , HOLY F * CKIN SHIT ! & # 39 ; supposed sway , like tree wind . flexible likely survive Oh ... pooped ! well said . & # 39 ; nothing upset , case like , people saying & quot ; thank god & # 39 ; alive & quot ; . Lets put simple : & quot ; god , believe , one behind earthquake engineer one behind skyscraper collapsing & quot ; & # 39 ; thank someone careful enough thank right guy . OMG ! ! ! ! # $ @ hat engineer . building l.a like . supposed sway building would crumble . OH HELL ! Город ходит ходуном . Я твой небоскреб дом шатал . delightful ... terrifying poop drawer kind way Awesome rare video ! thought rest camera something tripod . made difference . testament Japansese engineeering tokyo left standing ofcorse . supposed sway , otherwise crumple Japanese house building sturdy high quality world . Even wooden five story pagoda , made several hundred year ago , survived big earthquake . Hence , cameraman remains calm . isnt like spings bottom building heavy top building doesnt get destroyed repair concrete ide gun hand , way end quick incase went engineer say modern high rise one best place earthquake . believe , much building swaying , . lol would flipping . dont think ill visit . id love first base jump building big earthquake . builder name building Earthquakes common land rising sun Amazing ! Good ol & # 39 ; Japan say call Dubai building rubble 8.9 earthquake hit . & # 39 ; think building ugly . FUCK THISS currently listening lmfao Actually , . Outstanding architecture Newyork would RAVE . WOW ! ! ! ! ! sugoi ! thanks ! ! virtually proof Japan earth crust quickly move laterally whole meter .. Three piece crusttectonics permanently grinding towards . hanging/sticking longer period quake becoming quickly imminent . however long earthquake last , moron . anyone know long take building like stop swaying ? hope people call smart people nerd geek bully smart one see video way see wsould thank & quot ; geek & quot ; & quot ; nerd & quot ; saving life .... & # 39 ; welcome BWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUMMMMMMdodododododod ododododododdoddodododododododododododdodododoBWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMM OMG dont know hekk would & # 39 ; shit pant amazing . Well done engineer . Science bitch ... work . impressive earthquake engineering . also hear building creaking . good construction . FTW ! move like Jagger ... & # 39 ; got move like Jagger ... & # 39 ; got moooooves like Jagger .. XD los japoneses hacen todo bien ._ . un terremoto así en chile ( dios quiera ) hace desaparecer Sanhattan ._ . Sexy ! que feo se mueve : Unbelievable ! really swaying back forth Ha , godzilla chance knocking building ! building built bamboo , bamboo sway & # 39 ; back fourth without breaking . instead steel building build bamboo & # 39 ; cheaper . move like id pulling woman really trippy Holy crap ! see swaying back forth .. Man ! Glad u guy ok .. freaking scary building .. Masterful engineering . Engineering Level : Asian building collapse earthquake ? ( curious ) se colpiva la mia Italia ... eravamo tutti da S.Pietro ! & # 39 ; know talking . NYC & # 39 ; skyscraper built resist similar force generated hurricane . Essentially NYC & # 39 ; skyscraper earthquake proof . survive earthquake . However apartment building reinforced collapse earthquake . NY building would toppling . free falling fire okay , never going Japan . impressive Engineering , though ! Highrise engineering FTW ! earthquake hit NYC , & # 39 ; worried much skyscraper . & # 39 ; designed kind event mind , NYC recorded earthquake , engineer know . & # 39 ; lot worried older unreinforced brick masonry structure NYC lot . @ hiashiro1 New York Big City . amazing engineering top floor one building would cry like little girl sucking thumb ...... imagined top red/white thing trying increase motion ... @ AwesomeNstuff live SA 2 mini pussy earthquake past 2 year nothing compared country . omfdgdfgsfd ... geez look scary ! @ ! @ Thats crazy . seriously shit possible Japan ..... nowhere else world .. big city , building would never survive like Engineering best = ) last thing flee building earthquake - & # 39 ; likely get hit head/injured falling brick glass . Buildings designed sway earthquake absorb energy . Yay engineering ! & lt ; 3 @ xOxSweet238LipsxOx LMFAO DAYMN man .... huge structure MOVE like ? ? ? @ hiashiro1 new york built nothing land fill . building Think Dance . ¡WOW ! , que gran ingenieria la japonesa .... que horror haber estado en los ultimos pisos de estos edificios ... wow & # 39 ; amazing swaying like tree ! japanese sure know build o.O really amazing watching , evrytime remember experience , feel dizziness felt time . WOULD FREAK ! Amazing engineering built withstand kind shaking .. would shit pant wow amazing like alliiive . : OMG & # 39 ; scary know ? 20 % massive earthquake hit Japan O.e Luckily already invented building home withstand almost earthquake . oohohohohhooohhh ... sweat .... belive saw .. pfffffffff resonance frequency 1/6 per second ^^ @ JoeA320Pilot dat 1-2 inch xD dat alot RIGHT ! LEFT ! RIGHT LEFT ! Rollers . used 20+ story building sway 1-2 inch normal condition . built earthquake . epic vieo , fuck named ? would literally wet ._ . single fuck given mother nature day wtf 0:46 like Junior high school dance ! Building Level : Asians \m/ would living dream . Oh god : @ Chibzilla yeeeaah thinking commented video , know time left loose loose stupidity like comment . wow japanese build ANYTHING ! even building capable moving ! : Impresionante ! : @ najurinajuri & # 39 ; even feel like putting response together , & # 39 ; typical brainwashed yanky . Sad honestly : ( @ Chibzilla & # 39 ; whole different effect , impact plane sudden load , much behavior building , without taking account fire change property structural steel crashing plane one would bring ground ? Yeah okay America ... 60 floor building Panama , tallest floor one earthquake xD scary , though quake 3-4 Richter Scale : p damn thats nut @ BigScaryFace probably none , maybe damaged furniture computer ! LOL . BRING BITCH ! ! ! hell build building ? & # 39 ; incredible , nothing came crashing . New Zealand , 114 people killed 4 storey Studio/Language School building collasped caught fire ..... Makes & quot ; standard & quot ; absolutely pathetic compared Japan . amazing footage , especially seeing 2 building swaying building made 70 & # 39 ; @ gueydejalisco ya engneering doesnt go wish kind building Christchurch , NZ .... whole time watching video : fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck damage building ? need repair ? woW ! Buildings probably Union made : ) Truly amazing ... Japanese genius ! & # 39 ; jealous : im even made nervous Holy Hell ..... amazing much building swaying ! ! Insanely cool . earthquake like Japan & # 39 ; live , & # 39 ; dead . omg would hate building ... wonder many motion sickness building ... answer friend blowing wind & # 39 ; shitting pant top floor . Amazing Engineering Building standard Nomura building . 48th floor ! Thanks posting . building probably make couple brownie people good architect @ 2008shiny Woah ... & # 39 ; even remember writing actually . & # 39 ; okay , structural dynamic better mine . & # 39 ; really know much , basic . & # 39 ; know flagged spam ... maybe hater jealous knowledge ? xD ( jk ) @ TheJeleb Hmm interesting , thk height structure determines whether inertia dominates stiffness damping . Sry , structural dynamic suck hard ... XD btw ... heck ur msg flagged spam @ 2008shiny Nope , something remember looking text book long ago . & # 39 ; fond earthquake geographical study . @ TheJeleb u earthquake engineering mate ? seismic study ? idea building swayed much ! amazing well designed remember used design building big suspended weight top would sway counteract swaying building would stop toppling @ 2008shiny & # 39 ; structure probably something underground . Interesting point though ... & # 39 ; research . dynamic response dissipates energy . wonder specifically manged make sway
