Good lord ugly . damn loved ! ! Watched one night constantly edge seat . plot twist screaming scenery fantastic . think & # 39 ; definitely worth watch ! ! ! ! Diziyi izleyip bitirdim . Zaten 6 bölümcük . İzlemeye değer vakit kaybı da değil . Sadece boş zamanınızda izlemenizi öneririm . Çerez tadında bir diziydi . Aslında 6 bölüm olması da saçma çünkü kadro sağlam müzikler sağlam bir tek kurguda problem var . Bence daha fazla bölüm yapmak istiyorlardı ama nedense bir şey engel oldu . Dizide anlatılan şey öyle 6 bölümde bitirilecek bir şey değildi . En azından 4 sezon sezonda da 20 bölüm kadar yapabilirlerdi ki böyle yapmaları diziyi daha da iyi yapardı . Gijs Blom çok ama çok sevdiğim bir aktör . Dizide çok fazla önemsiz görünmüş ki bunu sonundan da anlayabilirsiniz . Gijs & # 39 ; dizide öyle görünce hayal kırıklığına uğradım çinkü sırf Gijs için başladığım bir diziydi . Neyse emeğe saygı diyelim 10/8 gibi bir puan veririm . İyi seyirler🖤👍🏻 & # 39 ; mind bugger . series differentiated source material lot . historical series series make sense lead people color ( call everyone people matter color ) . plot twist UNEXPECTED . Episodes 4-6 seems rushed okay . Overall worth binge-watching . Ardanwen superb . Ending bos battle meh . < b > Netflix adaptacion < /b > Looks better Cursed Everyone ’ hating show watched ’ honestly great ’ sorry yall see Parry read book 12 year old . based dutch book called & quot ; Brief voor de koning & quot ; changed story little . definitely worth check . similar book , good way .

Black poeple make lot cultural stealing netflix ’ intrigued fellowship letter Parecem ter investido bastante nessa produção de fato , locações belíssimas . Mas colocar uma música dessa trailer , para uma história que meu ver parece um épico de fantasia , é desanimador . Sem contar que essa coisa de adolescentes está ficando massivo na séries , mesmo que livro sejam personagens jovens , poderiam muito bem colocar atores e atrizes na faixa do 20 pra mais para interpretar . GoT fez isso e funcionou muito bem . Sem contar que não sent um pingo de emoção olhar do personagens em nenhum momento . Resumindo , tem tudo pra ser uma boa série , ma perderam mão já trailer . Tomara que eu esteja errada ! kinda movie make bored . Ceaser Fans ? ? 1917 medieval version : Great . Another YA book adaptation special chosen one main character Yo anyone know song trailer ? ?
