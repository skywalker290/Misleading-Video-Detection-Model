Armaniiiiiiii
Ri❤❤
RUSSIA
At the end we had our REVENGE.
What kind of training these athletes go through to play like that😮😮
France❤ from Indonesia
Pavard goal is the best goal in the wordl😱😱😱😱
Paaavard 🔥
Best match in that world cup
Di Maria two touch goal the best
Mbappe the Extraordinary!
Extra
Mbappe is very fast during this Match.
Mbape=cheetah😢
Dumb Rojo. Dk why Man U bought him 😂
AND MBAPPE
The day when mbappe destroyed argentina😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=116">1:56</a> this moment hurts a lot bt still he won the wc 2022
আমি আরজেনটিনার
Mbappe always against Argentina 😂
most intense match...too many goals., heart breaking for messi , rise of mpabe
Legends surely noticed something after dmaria&#39;s goal 💀💀
Commentator name?
Mbappe toyed with Argentina twice
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=47">0:47</a> messi&#39;s goal automatically turned into a assist 😂 poor messi
They met again
All 3 Penaltina World Cups were robbed, 78 Peru let them win 6x0, 86 Cocadona clear hand ball and 22 fifa gave them one penalty a game (most with no impact) so messi could win a WC...The most r4c1st country in America and the dirtiest in football history ever.
Poor defending by Argentina. The first Penalty could have been avoided. Mbappe already lost the control of the Ball..
Eternas Saudades<br> Dessa Copa.... 😢........
Wow its amazing that Argentina were actually leading at one point and managed to put in 3 goals with an absolute shitshow of a team under Sampaoli. Theyve come such a long way since then and avenged both losses in this tournament in 2022. Football can be so cruel and the most beautiful gift ever!
France ❤⚽🇫🇷
Top 3 de melhores jogos que eu já vi
This was the best game in the 2018 WC
Pavard’s goal was the best.
2022 Argentina ❤❤❤
França 4x3 Argentina
Este fue el mejor partido de ese mundial
Di Maria what a player!
Anyone from 2023 where Argentine  has finally won
I can&#39;t watch that Pavard goal without the song Blindling Lights suddenly playing on my hear
Mbaape weldone
This was one of the greatest World Cup games ever. The goals by DiMaria, Mbappe and especially Pavard were things of beauty.
Ikr
אמבפה איזה שחקן
It’s crazy, especially that mbappe scores  2 or 3 times when these teams are against each other.
Arg came dangerously close to forcing it to extra time but France&#39;s Pogba stalled time and ensured his team&#39;s progress. I thought Messi won&#39;t win it next time but here we are. Champions of the world. Never stop believing.
Pavard and Di Maria had the best goal in WC 2018
Messi got 2 assists
Argentina messed up on this game by not having Aguero in for more than just a few minutes.
Argentina vs France is always be the most beautiful match. And then, at 2022 they met again in the best final ever, Argentina won and became a champion.
42% of MBAPPE&#39;s 12 world cup goals have come against TINAs <br>He scored 5
Argentina had a bad start at the tournament. They awoke in this match, but against France, their awakening was a little meaningless, it was too late, they should’ve shown this performance earlier to avoid such a team like France. Anw, best match in Russia 2018 imo
mbappe my best player
.
🇨🇵
Todos queríamos que Argentina gane el mundial 2022, y cuando lo hizo todos la odiamos 🤡
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
Mbappe 🐸
Anyone know who are the commentrator in this match
Argentina got revenge.
pavards goal was the best volley i’ve seen
❤
Swears. Croatia weren&#39;t a match for France.
2018 la France est champion du monde, et marque le but de la décennie<br>et 2022 meilleur finale de l&#39;histoire de la coupe du monde moderne face à l&#39;argentine 3-3 triplé de Mbappé et le trophée ultime pour MESSI<br>le monde entier se rappellera de la rivalité France/Argentine.. 🇨🇵🇦🇷
What is it  with mbappe scoring hatricks against argetnina 😂
Ahora q lo veo el penalty dado a francia fue muy bien hecho
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=66">1:06</a>
Mess was playing alone he was the only that have hade a big match and the rest not
This match was so sad for me because messi has lose the World Cup and after the match he look like he wasn’t happy at all😢
How many future world champions played in this match 😂
Mbape will be one of the greatest world cup heroes ever I think. His world cup performance is always on another class.
Watching on 26.9.23 just for Pavard&#39;s smoothest goal 🥵🔥
why did he not start Aguero
The last sentence was insane <br>Messi is out of the world cup 😂
1 rigore non netto mai nella vita e un gol che se ci riprova altre 10000 volte non gli riesce, che dire signori. Questa è la Francia.
i wish this happened in 2022 aswell
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=115">1:55</a> - Messi&#39;s destiny 😮
France 🇫🇷 vs Argentina 🇦🇷was the best match depose Messi losing.
If martinez could play this game as goalkeeper😢
Mappe is the jr goat behind ronaldoo
if only FIFA didn&#39;t carry argentina&#39;s plastic world cup, france would have won 2 world cups back to back
Kylian Mbappe is  the Best Player in  the World*
i&#39;m argentinian, before this i don&#39;t know mbappe, after that i knew him
Mbappe
If Argentina won this game they probably would’ve choked to Belgium the next game
Saludos Argentina, Representar Mucho Bien a Futbol Sudamericano
Africa 🌍

I love you France ❤
Mpabbe got 2 goals in the row😊
They got the ultimate revenge 4 years later

¿Romero era el arquero? ya ni me acuerdo. Se lo re comió al 3er gol de Francia, ese de Mbappe. Una gelatina para tapar los remates.
Messi vs france and Mbappe vs Arg were fire always 🔥...

this is what happens in a world cup that doesn&#39;t get rigged by vargentina
La mejor francia vs la peor argentina y practicamente sin DT la seleccion argentina supo darle pelea, si seguian haciendoles caso a sampaoli perdian 5 a 0, gg no sampaoli
Who&#39;s here after the World Cup Final?
Kylian Mbappe is the Best Player  in  the World *
4-2😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=31">0:31</a> Di Maria
Fun fact : if Argentina lost this game the next country who lost was Portugal <br>If Argentina and Portugal battle it would be epic Messi vs Ronaldo but we all know that Ronaldo got out in quarter finals 2022<br>And Messi won in 2022
nace un nuevo clasico
What if Argentina won the World Cup 2018 against croatia 😂😂😂🎉🎉
Armani sucks....
Benjamin pavard with the most beautiful goal of the tournament volley and perfect and that against messi 😂😂😂and mbappe was 100 percent the best man on the place
ആരെങ്കിലും ഉണ്ടോ കപ്പ്‌ അടിച്ചതിന് ശേഷം കാണുന്നവർ
Embappe &gt; Messi
Messi avenging with a world cup final win 💪💪💪💪💪
Stated so far pavard oh how about that! Gloryu&#39;s!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!
예전에 있었던 2018 러시아 월드컵에서 프랑스와 아르헨티나의 경기를 가장 인상깊게 시청하였습니다. 아르헨티나를 응원했었지만 아쉽게 4-3이라는 스코어로 패배한 것이 너무 아쉬웠지만 두팀 선수들 모두 수고하셨습니다 !
Look at messie the😢😢<br>Look at messie now😊😊
Fantastic match
i like how lloris just fall down and says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=49">0:49</a> ive messed up
اجمل نهائي كأس عالم اشوفه في حياتي
Messi still gave 2 assists despite having a bad game<br>Goat things
I can not stop crying still today. Mbappe makes our dream disaster.
After witnessing the 2022 final, I couldn&#39;t resist watching it again. The level of performance displayed by both teams, France and Argentina, was nothing short of extraordinary. Their captivating performances against each other were truly remarkable.
Wake up to reality in madara voice
If Mbappe took the penalty he’d have two WC hat tricks vs Argentina
If Mbappe took the penalty he’d have two WC hat tricks vs argentina
Perfect revenge for Messi🔥🔥🔥🔥
Revenge of Messi was one of the greatest moment ❤️❤️
france took them out to win the world cup, argentina took them out to win the world cup.
Dimaria is always a big game player
What a player mbappe is
Argentina vs France = Revenge Taken Successfully ✅<br>Argentina vs Croatia = Revenge Taken Successfully ✅
Who is here after Messi lifting the Qatar World Cup 2022 ? 😍
Goat 🐐 mbappe 👑
Argentina vs France in the last 2 WC&#39;s <br>2 matches 13 goals <br>2 World cups ( 1-1 each )<br>Absolutely Insane
Di Maria scores to take the lead POV=Pavarotti be like nah ah
Packed has the best goals
Where is Pessi’s penalty? 😂
This was the real 2018 Final. &quot;It&#39;s a pity&quot; when this types of games happen so early in the tournament due to just the chance of how the group crosses. No other team was even close to forcing France to play their best on that tournament. Same thing happened in 2022.
DiMaria is not aging well 😂 he looks like a creepypasta 😂
Imagine if Argentine manager started Agüero than Higuain in 2018. France wouldn&#39;t even advance here.<br><br>Plus the Goalie is trash. 0 IQ. But it is what it is
el peor equipo de argentina en la historia  nose ni como metimos 3 goles
Argentina against France is sure to present a great game to watch 🔥
the beginning of Messi&#39;s villan arc
This match was away better than Final 2022 !!!! Also Aguero was playing !!!
I find it really ironic that I supported France passionately in that match, only to find myself supporting Argentina with every cell of my body against them 4 years later.
Revenge is sweeter 🐐
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=115">1:55</a> Destiny givin us a hint. Look above Messi&#39;s head
Argentina’s first mistake Rojo shouldn’t have fouled Mbappe because I don’t think he would’ve caught up to the ball it might’ve went out for a goal kick <br>Second: Armani should’ve came up from his position as soon as Mbappe played the ball past Rojo
this is the best match
Kylian   Mbappe  is the  Best Player  in   the  World *
ARG v FRA - Best match of 18 wc<br>ARG v FRA - Best match of 22 wc
4 years later Argentina had their well deserved rematch. This France team was unstoppable and the Argentina team France faced in 22 nothing compared to the weak overdependant on Messi they were in 18
Argentina worst squad ever seen
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=114">1:54</a><br><br>I came from the future, look over Messi&#39;s head
Can anyone please tell me the name of the dive by the goalkeeper at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=84">1:24</a>
This match was entertaining than the 2022 World Cup final
Nice match, but how the tables have turned now…
I think 2018 camera quality better then 2022 Qatar World cup .
iam four you love ❤❤
If this AR team had Emiliano Martinez, Ar would have won it!
Pavard 😮‍💨
KYLIAN  MBAPPE is  the  Best  Player  in  the  World *
Argentina vs France in last 2 World cup = 13 goals !
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=55">0:55</a> accidentally goal💀
Revenge is sweet
World cup 2022 final 😂😂😂
BLUD GOT REVENGE 4 YEARS LATER 🔥🔥🔥
😢😢
Fun Fact :- Angel di Maria Has scored in every world cup final
Who was the commentrator please
Mbape best flayer
For me Argentina vs France was the best match every world cup
Mbappe has 5 goals against Argentina 🥵
Agueroooooooooooooooooooooooooooo🐐🇦🇷
We are back again MF
It is always insane when you think mbappe was just 19 here. He is truly a football prodigy, we will not see an 19 year performing this level any time soon. His confidence and his shot strength is just clinical
How about that😮
Revenge Done ✔️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=58">0:58</a>
Wait go and see 2022 highlitEEE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=115">1:55</a> El logo de del mundial Qatar 2022 encima de messi
Pavard literally sent the ball flying like a bee…🥵🥵🔥🔥
Prime France team...❤️🖤
Mbappe kinda carried for France every time they played Argentina
If dibu was here half the shots wouldn’t have made it lol
2022 3 3  paneltis 4 2 wow
I’m understanding that Argentina and France national teams are almost exact same level. When they play none of them fully dominate the other. When one them wins, they barely do so.
Messi lost in 2019 against France <br>Messi takes revenge in 2022 world cup Final in penalties
Revenge done 🇦🇷
Kylian Mbappe Is The Best Youngstar
This was the best  world cup
After this match, Dibu Martínez probably was like “enough is enough” after seeing 4 years of suffer, and casually decided to change the history of Argentina forever.<br><br><br><br><br><br>❤️🇦🇷
Best match I have ever seen❤
Mbappe 2nd goal = di maria goal in final wc 2022
Sweet Revenge 2022
where is emi marteniz
NO Team can Beat France...... Super Powerful Team and Talents....................
2022 could have been the same. But Emiliano’s leg save pushed Argentina to the penalty shootout🎉
These teams met way too soon in the 2018 wc
Expectations - Brazil vs Portugal, Reality -Argentina vs France
It&#39;s same like world cup final between these two.. Dimaria scoring goal, messi fought till last n mbappe scored two to make difference. But yeah results different
The 2022 world cup final was very personal 🤣<br>Messi couldn&#39;t lose again to Mbappe.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=93">1:33</a> that pass was downright heavenly, I can&#39;t stop watching it. Pinpoint.
France almost won again but Emiliano Martínez didnt let that happen
♥♥
Di Maria kick was sooo sweet and Messi assist to Aguero was amazing they almost go to the final again and also get revenge to croatia
Whenever these two countries clash on the international stage you know you’re in for a treat
Argentina llegó al mundial 2018 en medio de una crisis directiva, los jugadores estaban peleados con el DT, no se hablaban y no pudieron enfocarse en el mundial, también fué un quiebre y fin de ciclo. Aún así Argentina hizo un gran partido con el que sería el campeón del mundo más tarde. Hoy 4 años después se volvieron a enfrentar, Argentina con 19 debutantes y un Lionel Messi en el final de su carrera pero con la experiencia y hambre de gloria.
Bro what was every goalkeeper here
calling it now france vs Argentina final 2026 world cup
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=114">1:54</a> football was saved.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=114">1:54</a> best line for me 🇫🇷🇮🇳
Best match <br>Allez les blues 🇫🇷
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=58">0:58</a>
When it&#39;s Mbappé v Messi, you know that a show is coming.
But in the  last world cup, argentina won to france in penalties. Big Argentina!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Di Maria was underrated from then till now🇦🇷🔥
Four years later Messi got his trophy
One of my favorite World cups ever (yes france is my nation and I’m super happy they won)
Argentina took revenge on France and Croatia in the 2022 world cup
桃花影落飞神剑！
আমার ম্যাসি!!!! মাইরে ল আম্বাপ্পের গস্তি সদি
Argentina vs France is always so much thriller  and have never seen argentina vs brazil like that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=45">0:45</a> lol mercado take messi amazing goal😂😂
Karama like boomerang 🪃🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷💯
Who knew about  that Argentina going to win Worldcup in 2022 against France
La France est la meilleure 🤗🥳🥳🥳😎👍👍❤❤🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
New rivalry???
Di Maria and Messi with Argentina is a legendary combo
Dibalas lebih menyakitkan di final world cup 2022.🤭🤭🤭
I wonder if Martinez was in goal, would Rojo thrown mbappe down? Cause that last touch forced the ball very far from him and Armani just stood still

Mbappe eterno padre de Argentina y Di Maria, eterno padre de Francia xd
Mbapee was close to hat trick which he did in the final🐐🐐🐐
A player who lost world cup 2018 badly and got wrecked by france but in 2022 he shined up and wrecked france for a revenge and won the world cup
The France and Argentina rivalry is the best
Mbappe’s double goal and Pavard’s Volley was astonishing
Haaah. Where is fra ? Where is fra rev has been taken 😂😂
What a game!!
Anyone after Qatar World Cup
2018: France<br>2022: Argentina <br>Even Teams 🐐 🔥
That last head strike by Aguero was amazing
Messi Won the Wc
It&#39;s crazy to think that the 2022 world cup final could have ended in the same scoreboard from 2018 france vs argentina.
World Cup 2018 Best Match <br>France 🇫🇷 vs Argentina 🇦🇷<br><br>World Cup 2022 Best Match<br>Argentina 🇦🇷 vs France 🇫🇷
Back then it felt just like another knockout match. But after 2022, it doesn&#39;t. Who would have thought that actually this could have been an anticipated final?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=115">1:55</a> pain
Now We have our Emi Martinez 😌♥️🇦🇷&lt;3
France 🧠
France team was so strong in 2018
As a Messi fan this match hurt a lot but watching after the Goat lifted his world cup brings great joy
Back in 2018,no one knew how to tackle the pace of Mbappe.....Now in 2022 the Argentine defenders knew their individual assignments to handicap the whole team to disconnect Mbappe from his normal play
France: Wins 2018<br><br>Argentina: We’re gonna do a little bit of revenge in 2022
ししちつすくききすすせくすす

Mbappe is seriously a dangerous player no way😭
the third goal and the fourth goal of France.  Argentina you cannot defend with a line of 3. you learnt your lesson. and now you are world champion&#39;s.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=68">1:08</a> where’s he? I didn’t see him in 2022’s world cup
Fun Fact:- Di Maria wakes up against France 😂

ARG VS FA 2018 FA WIN ARG VS FA ARG 🏆🏆🏆🏆 WIN 2022

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=93">1:33</a> how did number 6 missed that he could’ve pass it to somone or kick it our before mbape scores a 4th goal
the fact that the scoreline could be 4-3 for france again if Kolo Muani landed the shot in...
Who are watching this match after Argentina defeated France in final 2022
2022 final Argentina 💙🤍
<b>കടം വീട്ടി അവന്മാരെ തൂക്കി തന്നെ worldcup പൊക്കിയിട്ടുണ്ട്</b> 🙂🔥
Argentina truly deserves it
Right now Fifa Win 2022 Argentina
Pavard&#39;s goal is incredible
Funfact:&quot;Both Di Maria and Mbappe scored in France x Argentina 2018 and 2022,also with scoreline
Haha revenge finally served 4 years later
After the 2022 WC its clear that argentina and france really do put a show agaisnt each other.
This was the time when the world noticed a great talent of a teenager called Mbappe, scoring two goals vs Argentina. <br>Winning the cup and scoring in the final was the cherry on top.<br>It is hard to believe that he scored more three goals against the very same Argentina the cup to follow.<br>A great legend is on the making
Revenge Done against France 💙🤍
Very close game. The only thing missing for Argentina was El Dibu
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=66">1:06</a> my boy scored from a different TIME ZONE 🇫🇷
Ese día lo goze
vamos argentina 🎉
Who is the commentator, he&#39;s amazing.❤️
Hi<br>January 2023
Man, Martinez and the new squad sure made a change
had it not been for that penalty, the results wouldve been different
2 of the best strikes in world cup history were done this match
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=36">0:36</a> a crazy goal one of the best in this world cup
Mbappe almost killed Argentina in finals ! But this time France lost ! Argentina finally!!
Who is here after Argentina won their rematch?
4-2 this time round but on penalties and Argentina won this time🙌🏽🇦🇷🇦🇷
Mbappe against argentina is always on another level
Mbappe wayyyyy better than Messi is not even a joke
Bhai a golkeeperer name ki
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=65">1:05</a> a bird ⚽ flying
Perfect Revenge in a perfect place. Smiling face after 4 Years. It&#39;s a treat to watch Messi lift the World Cup trophy at Qatar. Now, they are World Champion. Messi is GOAT.
look how Argentina revenged on both Croatia and France now(2022)
the beginning of this highlights just seems like a start of villian vs hero scence
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=48">0:48</a> lol Lloris
I rewatch this after the 2022 world cup final
Expected final:
Argentina lost 3-0 to Croatia and 4-3 to France back then. Then in 2022 beat 3-0 Croatia and France in penalties, winning the World Cup. Argentina was thirsty of revenge, simply epic.
So this was the real final in 2018 and we didn&#39;t know it
This is a WORLD CUP RIVALRY. Two world cups two greatest matches  of all time. One for France one for Argentina.🥶🥶 EPIC
Don&#39;t worry, in four years and a half we Will have a sweet Revenge !!!! 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=25">0:25</a>
Mvappe is the best 🎉
Aha..Mbappe have been Argentina tormentor for long time...that explains two minutes silence and other wild celebrations by Argentina players.
France, arrête de pleurer. Ce sont de mauvais perdants, des pédés et des insupportables.
It&#39;s technically the game where Di Maria scored against France twice.
Who is here after 2022 final🐢
QUE VOLTEO!   🌵999
And that long shot beautiful
I wanted mpappe to win this year he scored a hat trick in final
The Argentina team did this at a time of absolute turmoil. They had a horrible coach and absolute no direction. What a turn they have made in just 4 years. Vamossss Argentina!!!!
That was the very best match of 2018 World cup<br>It was rather an early final than the round of last 16<br>Even the best goal of the tournament was scored in this match
nice
Argentina vs France is such a massive show
What an amazing match
France-Argentina is the new Classic of football
Y 4 años después hubo revancha papá Aguante Argentina se vino la tercera 🥇🏆🇦🇷
Another awesome match
Frace vs Argentina is the new El Classico .
And remember , mbappe was 19 back then and had 2 goals and 1 assist 😎
What a sweet revenge by Argentina in 2022. One circle got completed for Messi to lift the world cup.
I must admit ..now this loss do not hurt... Before I used to hate watching this... But now .. redemption....
One of the most entertaining WC matches ever!
2022 🌎🏆🇦🇷
These 2 teams are like football anime rival teams. They bump into each other at every turn and give off an epic match which keeps us all in suspense.
Revenge done💥🇦🇷
And now Argentina just took revenge on France
I love this. France football at it&#39;s finest 🇫🇷⚽
When it comes to Pavard, i do not know what was smoother the shot or the knee slide.
Revenge taken in 2022 final
Who’s here after Argentina won
Di Maria and Mbappe scored again in 2022🎉
The revenge has been taken
The revenge in 2022 was beautiful. Chef&#39;s kiss. F off Mbappe!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=22">0:22</a> アンヘル・ディ・マリア
What a phenomenal game, so close to being 4-4, who knows what could’ve happened
Watched it Live on Tv and I was so heartbroken because  of messi <br>But now everthing is changed messi won tha wc against same opponent
🇦🇷: ⭐️⭐️⭐️<br>🇫🇷: ⭐️⭐️
Who watch this after the Final 2022?
Messi 🖤
Wow ..Arg has three rivals in worldcup ..Old timers nederlands and France ...now Saudi added to list 🤣🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=15">0:15</a> he plays league of legends bro
2022 Argentina got their revenge <br><br>3-3 (4-2 penalties)
These 2 teams made the best match of 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
mbappe is a beast, he scored two goals against Argentina in 2018 and three against Argentina in 2022.
Honestly I say to myself even if we lost against you Argentinians when our two countries face each other that gives a historical match no matter who wins we are great football nations ♥It was a pleasure to play against you for two cups in a row!
Mbappe scored 3 goals against Argentina in the last world cup and 2022 too
Best match of World Cup 2018 &amp; 2022. 🇫🇷v 🇦🇷. I feel lucky that this era is my football era.
Seeing Messi sad at the end of 2014 and 2018 World cups was very heartbreaking. But now he&#39;s the 2022 champion and we don&#39;t have to feel sad looking back at the past. He&#39;s certified himself as the greatest ever
For the French, this didn&#39;t aged well
Di Maria is Iniesta for Messi.
Best game ever - together with WC 2022 ARG - FRA final
Ver esto en el 2022....
Mbappe utter nightmare for Argentina
Coming back in 2022….REVENGE 😈
Emi Martinez was the difference this time.
4 years later these teams played in the 2022 World Cup final, a final for the ages!!!
el tortuga nos tiene alquilados
and 4 years later the rematch was tremendous
Argentina and France ran it back and Argentina got their get back , what a final it was this year CONGRATS TO ARGENTINA 🇦🇷
The world praises Argentina!
Emi Martinez was the real hero behind arg success...winning 2 penalty shoot out is world class
Argentina is Mbappes dog
And Argentina won the wc this time ,vamos
And now they repeated and Argentina Won it on final and Messi lifted the World Cup!!!!
Vingance
Itu dlu sekarang beda ygy
Oks
I have seen them face Twice in world cups and both the matches were epic ones.
Messi: “and so it ends, My race has run. I regret nothing, it was fun”
Mbappe has the speed.<br>Strangely he did not show it in the 2022 final.
2018 wc final was foul no team did their best and 2022 wc final was very realistic and dramatic how best they gave in finals
🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Perú vs Inglaterra 🇵🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 4-5
Avenge completed
MESSI
IM still watching this
Combined with the 2022 Final, these two countries have just built a genuine football rivalry.
This match was INCREDIBLE! France and Argentina really know how to put on a show when they play each other.
who else got recommended this after france vs Argentina final 🤣
Messi the greatest of all time🐐👑👊
Revenge 2022 Argentina champion
Who&#39;s here after Argentina🇦🇷 won wc 😃😃😃Vamos Argentina🇦🇷🇦🇷 The goat Lionel Messi🙌
This is the real FRANCE SQUAD, but in 2022, they played without Pogba, Kante, Benzema, and yet 3-3, if Pogba, kante and Benzema are in squad, will crumble the  messi&#39;s dream
What a team both r, came here just after 2022 WC final
Billion association can’t make a proper highlights more than 2 min. <br>Yep 👍
France eould have won the final 2022 if Giroud and Griezmann wasn&#39;t  substituted
<b>2018: France knocks Argentina out of World Cup</b><br><b>2022: Argentina Knocks France out of World Cup and makes France gets 2nd Place</b>
4 năm trước thì như thế, nhưng bây giờ thì khác rồi
Messi won 2022
Messi got his revenge, Tho I am sad that the 2022 World Cup was Ronaldo and Messi final World Cup, but as a Ronaldo fan I congratulate Messi.
Who is watching after 2022 world cup final
France-Argentina : 2018 - 7 goals , 2022 -  6 goals (+6 penalties). No need 30 more teams in a worldcup 😁
After the wc 22  is over , i watch this again🤣
Who is watching again after world cup 2022. Messi rocks
18th December 2022 a day which forever will be etched in everyone&#39;s memory.<br>A day when history was made🇦🇷
പ്വോളി
These two teams put the best match<br>2018 was exciting<br>But 2022 was fire !
Revenge is taken 💙🇦🇷 ....don&#39;t mess up with MESSI 💙💙
This match was even close tied it with 4-4  scores. There was actually a moment where Argentina accidentally missed a chance in a last few seconds but didn&#39;t shows in this highlight..
Argintina just beat france
Argentina wins 2022 Wc🥹🏆

4 years later, Di Maria scored yet again vs France ❤️
France raciste vous ete devoile
Mbappe loves to score against Argentina🎉
argentina vs france <br>is the elclasico of international football
Comeback is always greater than setback
I was rooting for Argentina in 2022 but man that Mbappe dude is kind of a legend himself. Why don&#39;t we hear more from him like we hear from other legends like Messi and Ronaldo? 🤔
Both this and 2022 WC Final we saw unreal football being played. Expect this to be seen whenever france and Argentina clash. 🔥 ❤️
no teniamos arquero en el 2018, cuando vi que habian convocado a CAVALLERO y ARMANI dije ya fue, no podemos, desde que se lesionò abondanzzieri en el 2006 esta claro que sin un arquerazo no podes llegar a una final ni ganarla, faltabas vos DIBUU
This what we call free flow ball..very entertaining ..that what the worldly people like to enjoy looking at ball moving .Win or lose second matter..Today They luck next time loser luck  that how the Universe keep us learn from mistake...If only one team win all the time there something wrong .Same like how u put on your relation, sometimes u had give &amp; take Not like im Only the Great person in this planet..Hola....🙏

Guess what? Argentina is the winner this time in 2022
Go France 🇫🇷
To think that year Argentina literally messed up, the incompetent coach, they didn&#39;t even have a main goalie while Martinez only watched from the bleachers because he didn&#39;t get called.
This fixture is becoming a classic
France vs Argentina never disappoints
This match aged well
coming back to this after Argentina got their revenge, the fact Argentina scored 3 with that squad only to come back 4 years later with an entirely new team is amazing football is something special Vamos Argentina Champions🤞🏻🤞🏻

What a beautiful revenge in WC 2022! 😊
Hey! 2022 <br>The story is different and Messi lifts the World Cup.
Looks like the game turned upside down for France this year 🔥
Revenge has been taken ❤️
France vs Argentina duels, seem to fetch us a high score line with entertaining football - World Cup 2018 and now 2022 😊
France didn&#39;t deserve the end score of 2022 WC, and deserved to lose much earlier. they got lucky with a penalty call that forced the game into extra time the second France goal was the only that was truly worthy.. they weren&#39;t in this game at all .. for 90% of game .. scoreline should have been 4 something in second half  before 80 mins... MBappe is far from being Messi and this probably  was the last final he will play.. for France.. Argentina shut down the French team that ran other team ragged very well... well deserved.
back here they took revenge in 2022 final messi wins world cup
Today, Argentina has the revenge they wanted.
Messi finally made it 🇦🇷⭐<br>Mbappe what a great player tío🔥
Finally messi achieved his dream in 2022❤️

How about now?
Revenge is a dish...<br>Best served messy...<br>🇦🇷🇦🇷⭐⭐⭐🇦🇷🇦🇷
Anyone after Argentina beat France 4-2 on Penalties after that thriller 3-3 full time? These 2 teams never disappoint.
As a French, I am truly saddened by France&#39;s 2022 defeat at the world cup final, but Argentina deserves the win since France played poorly for 70 minutes and Argentina had the best opportunities. I regret that last shot from Kolo Muani at the very end of the game as we would have won without going into these perilous shootouts. Shootouts are just a coin toss and we lost it today like in 2006. Unlike Argentina which will be weakened by the loss of Messi and Di Maria, France will remain competitive and will hopefully win the next world cup. Bravo à l&#39;Argentine et à Messi et Vive la France et Mbappé. ❤
Di Maria knows how to score against France
Mbappe always plays well against Argentina
France goalkeeper was high 😤😤
Argentina champions 🏆🇦🇷🔥
Now we are the World’s Champions ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Who’s here after Argentina won the World Cup in 2022?
congratulation from France to all Argentinians people... until the 70, I thought we were missing our game on French side... then we could surprisingly come back to 2-2... then you scored 3, then we came back again... on all the game, it&#39;s well deserved on your side, to win this match... hope it will bring joy in Argentina... on French side, we are disapointed, we would have liked to put the third star on the shirt, but for all the argentinians suffering in their everyday life, I am happy for you too... Have fun, enjoy those moments, 4 years ago when we won it, the French streets went crazy during the whole competition (and after the winning too, sure)... it&#39;s great moments to live for a country, to win a football world cup... the best from France, and congratulation again...
Argentina could have won if Sampaoli wasn&#39;t dumb enough to bench Aguero and not taking Lo Celso to Russia. No wonder the players were all furious with him.
Vamos Argentina! Argentina 2022 WC Champion.<br>(19/12/2022 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6oOcDFmLY&amp;t=69">01:09</a> IST)

Game changed today
El Mundial de la CORRECCIÓN!!!! No fue un MUNDIAL de Fútbol, fue un &quot;HOMENAJE a Messi&quot; con el dineros de los Clubs y aficionados. Fue un &quot;TRAJE A MEDIDA&quot;. El máximo cargo Quatari responsable por la realización del Mundial ya lo &quot;AFIRMÓ&quot; en la apertura desta &quot;FARSA&quot;, que su MAYOR DESEO, sería entregar la COPA del MUNDO a MESSI. Fue un &quot; TRAJE A MEDIDA&quot;. La FIFA no tiene &quot;moral&quot; para dirigir el fútbol.  Tienen que dimitir en bloque, como las otras instituciones (UEFA,...). Demostraron el nivel de CORRECCIÓN de estas organizaciones!!!! Las SANSIONES del Argentina/Países Bajos cayó en el olvido. Los insultos y agresiones vistos en ese partido demuestran el propio nivel que tiene la FIFA. Atletas que deberían ser descalificados por conducta ANTIDEPORTIVA,  están en estos momentos siendo vangloriados!!!! FUERA la FIFA y sus CORRUPTOS!!!

👏👏👏🇲🇫🇲🇫🇲🇫⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️❤️❤️❤️
Now u giving it as a recommendation just before Wolrd Cup Final .. u Naughty Utube 😉
4 yrs later the two teams meet again for the ultimate glory..What a great match it was... Hopefully this time also it turns around something like this..
We will ask instead for these tears💙🇦🇷
I can feel Argentina winning the today&#39;s world cup
What a game !  Pavard&#39;s goal is extraordinary.  this match will remain one of the best of the World Cups after the France-Germany of 1982.
I am .... I hope today&#39;s game is as exciting as this one ... only hoping for Messi to win.
Anybody here on the eve of iconic France Argentina finale
💙🤍❤️
Ukoliko bi Francuska pobedila trebalo bi ih diskvalifikovati i oduzeti titulu i zabraniti ucestvovanje na sledećem svetskom prvenstvu!!! To kazem iz razloga sto Francuzi su izvorno beli ljudi dok je Francuski tim preko 80% pun crnaca, isto tako treba zabraniti svim reprezentacijama da vode igrace kojima su oni dali drzavljanstvo samo da bi igrali za njihove reprezentacije!!! Trebalo bi da ima pravilo da ukoliko nisi treca generacija ljudi iz te drzave ne mozes da ucestvujes na takmicenju!!! U ostalom to nije posteno prema drugim reprezentacijama i drugim takmicarima, a na sve to je sramota ubacivati strane igrace u tim i predstavljati ih kao da su vasi!!! Ocigledno je da je politika previse umesana u sve moguce sportove i zato sportska takmicanja gube na znacaju i gube gledaoce, jer politika previse namesta i menja pravila kako hoce tacnije kako odgovara pojedinim zapadnim drzavama!!! Prebrojte strane igrace po reprezentacijama koji su dobili papire samo da bi igrali za njih u reprezentacijama, po meni je to varanje i to je jadno i bedno zar ne?
It&#39;s time for the FINAL between France and Argentina in Lusail stadium in Qatar
Final day!
History is about to repeat its self again
