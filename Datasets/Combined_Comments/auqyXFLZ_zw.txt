that asist was so clean🔥🔥
The second is brilliant but the header for the first goal, he makes it look so easy. Suarez has whipped that ball in so fast. Absolutely brilliant  from the two strikers
Its very bad how people are blaming and shaming Ronaldo in replies, adrien silva and jao maria in midfield were wrost rated that day for not creating chances but ya blame Ronaldo... Messi and Vargentina wouldn&#39;t had made it in the tournaments without rigged penalties but here we see even pure penalty being denied to Portugal
Portugal got robbed that day, leao was pushed inside D but ref didn&#39;t gave foul.. They never wanted Portugal to go further for obvious reasons
Cavani 😍
Coast to coast between Cavani and Suarez give me goosebumps
Suarez biggest 💀
that match cavani truly humbled the camel of riyadh 🤣🐪
Everything is rigged😡😡😡
Poor Portugal cant goal
Rigged ball
Wow
This is probably the best ever brace from a player, pure quality goals
Portugal has zero depth on this squad.
The Second Goal of Cavani was pure class! Cavani is underrated af<br>He was crazy at PSG<br>What an amazing player 🔥🔥🔥
Cavani Suarez Godin and magic forlan go urugvajj pozz from serbia
Uruguai 2x1 Portugal
Who&#39;s here only for the commentary? 😅
El segundo de Cavani es una obra maestra. Me gustó más que el de Pavard. Mi favorito de ese mundial.
Suùuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Torreira💪
This is and was my favorite fifa world cup match Uruguay 🇺🇾 2:1 Portugal 🇵🇹
4 years later in Qatar, Portugal beat Uruguay 2-0 and Uruguay didn&#39;t make into the Round of 16.
If a goal can be beautiful, then its cavani&#39;s 2nd goal. Wow!
❤❤❤❤
Both Suarez and Cavani are the toppest super stars of Uruguay
Cavani&#39;s second finish.❤️
Cavani vs portugal 🔥
penaldo hat trick in group stage  and ghosted in this match ....ghost fraud of portugal...if penaldo is goat then how many wc final has he played ?...
Other Uruguayan teammates be like: Just gIve a cross, Cavani is there to score…
Is some one know this commentator name?🤔
Happy independence day Uruguay from india 🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️❤️🇺🇾🇺🇾
That 2nd goal from Cavani is just an absolute beauty.
2nd goal from cavani is definitely top 3
Look how careless the defender was when 2 nd goal was made.He was not even marking his player just running looking back
Legend Cavani 🔥😍
Cavani 2 vs CR 0 XD
Russia has Sido de lo más chimba q ha habido de mundiales ....
I think Uruguay is the most underrated football country in the world. Both the national team and clubs. <br><br>The national team won 2 World Cups, 2 Olympics (before world cup) and 15 Copa America&#39;s.<br><br>CA Peñarol and Nacional are 2 big clubs in Uruguay. They both won 3 world titles (Intercontinental Cup), and the Copa Libertadores: CA Peñarol: 5 times and Nacional: 3 times.<br><br>Amazing football history for a small country!!
Tnx to Cavani for destroying penaldo
Who here js watching the game in 2023. AFTER they got their revenge against France in the 2022 final
That cross by Suarez 🔥
No penalty, no party for Cristiano 🤭
I need this comentator on every Finals of UCL.
a much ordinary beings a hard hit the hurt pipe
the 2nd goal is what got me into football when I was nine, I’m now fourteen 😂
Penaldo 0 goals in 5 worlds cup knockout stage
I really thought this was ronaldo&#39;s year but those goals were the best goals. especially cavani&#39;s winner that was probably one the best goals I have seen,
Anyone here after Portugal defeat Uruguay in World Cup round of 16?
Always thought that 2nd Cavani goal should have been goal of the tournament. So difficult to pull off but of course people will like the Pavard rocket better.
Who&#39;s the commentator?
Cristiano 🐐💔
Say what you want, Uruguay deserved to win 2010 WC....<br>Obviously they weren&#39;t THE best national team....<br>But the way they played was just awesome
Griezmanns world cup: Am I a joke to you?
Cr7❤
Could&#39;ve been Messi vs Ronaldo, Argentina🇦🇷 vs Portugal🇵🇹 in the Quarter final
21/04/2023
Hahahahaha RONALDO YOU AREE THRASH NEXT TO MESSI
Had Argentina and Portugal won in the round of 16, they would&#39;ve faced each other😢
What a miss CR7 had and then Pepe scored,i liked Cavani&#39;s goal when shot a cross
Suvarez ✨️✨️
우루과이가 포르투갈을 상대로 이런 멋진 활약을 보여줬을 때 정말 대단했습니다. 특히 이 경기에서는 Cavani 선수가 엄청난 활약을 보여준 것 같습니다. 이 경기 정말 재미있게 시청했습니다.

Jaime Roos &quot;cuando juega Uruguay&quot; vale la pena buscarlo

Suiii
Here for the future.
I come from the future and in the next World Cup Portugal will beat Uruguay 2-0

Nooooo
Whos here after Uruguays defeat against Portugal
We are waiting for the 4  years. Today is that day💥💥💥Portugal fans🥳🥳
cavani
Uruguay ist so schlecht schämt euch
Todays match😍
Absolutely tragic all those years Cavani wasted in Paris.  Could’ve cemented himself as one of the greatest strikers we’ve seen if he’d played in a more competitive league (Ik he was unreal for Napoli and United to a lesser extent). Absolutely fantastic footballer.
Uruguay ain&#39;t as strong as there were back then the portugal the attack from is way more intense and more creative we have a lot of potential anything can happen
Tomorrow Uruguay gonna do it again
Creio que ganha Uruguay 2 a 1 outra vez. Sempre foi complicado jogar com Portugal porém os defensores Portugueses são lentos, CR7 já n é o mesmo de antes. Uruguay jogando bem e sem erros ganha sem problemas os Portugueses.
Uruguay 4-0 Portugal FIFA 2022 world cup.
History will repeat in this World Cup too
Who&#39;s excited for their rematch on Monday?
Cavani Crush Portuguese Dream Cavani He can find Goal any Angel any situation
Juara tertua pagelaran piala dunia
Underrated super star cavani
Кто знает как зовут этого комментатора?
Cor ou cour
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=15">0:15</a> this attack was just world class
It&#39;s Cavani magic
Uruguay  5-0 Portugal
This year 2022 also Portugal &amp; Uruguay in same group
Bousci
suiiiiiiiii
group h result?
Cavani maestro.
Hopefully the Portuguese don’t play the same way on the 29th November 2022 World Cup and loose 😢
This year Portugal will win the world cup, there I said it first
I forgot Cavani&#39;s second goal. How was that not a top 10 goal?
I hate this match
Portugal will rematch Against Uruguay in Group stage in World cup 2022
revenge is coming wait to all
Its Uruguay night
Wish they would pull this off again at 2022
Hopefully we get to see Cavani and Suarez play together one last time in this world cup
0 goals for penaldo
🇵🇹🤝🏻🇺🇾  agr em 2022 o reencontro 🌍
That Cavani brace never gets old. Both goals are so artistic and just seemed to come out of nowhere. Beautiful. Vamos Uruguay 🇺🇾
This time beat by 3-1 by Portugal sure
That second cavani goal 🔥🔥🔥
Suárez or Ronaldo?<br><br>Cavani takes it personal...
1.42 it seems like they previously planned to fall near the defenders
Edinson
People don&#39;t realise it was Pepe&#39;s fault completely for the second uruguay goal - he should have easily won that header.
Group H World cup 2022 is very special for Portugal<br><br>wc 2002 korea 1 vs 0 portugal<br>wc 2014 ghana 1 vs 2 portugal<br>wc 2018 uruguay 2 vs 1 portugal
I think Cavani is better than Ronaldo
Cavani&#39;s 2nd goal is pure art, one of the best world cups goals ive ever seen, watching it live that night and rooting for uruguay makes it even more special💖
I&#39;m just here to hype myself up for the World Cup. That Cavani finesse though 🔥
That cross from Suarez is world class. Never seen one like that before
Worth mention this Portugal was the current european champion...
OJALÁ GANE 🇺🇾
Daniel Mann Commentary... 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️
uruguay looks very scary in this world cup they got valverde and nunez too now
Its time to revenge
Love the commentator
Uruguay played defensive game, not a gentleman’s game
That second goal by Cavani was why they call him El Matador.
Uruguay 🇺🇾 🇺🇾
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=101">1:41</a> Anyone noticed how Portugal and Argentina both miss their last chance in the same way
La creme de la creme Cavani oui Monsieur
Que feo que FIFA no subió el partido completo!
Cavani Curler is a thing a of beauty what a game
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=102">1:42</a> que sincronización xd jajajaja
What a match absolutely hotor tohor match<br>What a spirit from EDERSON CAVANI✌💪
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=75">1:15</a>
I dream about a France vs Uruguay game where Cavani didn&#39;t get injured. Him and Suarez were such perfect compliments. Both were athletic, but Suarez was swifter and craftier and Cavani longer and stronger. The only defender who Suarez could just not get past was Varane, and he&#39;s the one who would&#39;ve had Cavani duty. <br><br>Injuries in general just make me sad.
\ Gilola so I Kehlani
This is Yes recibe Jesus Christ salvation personal this Yes recibe in My ♥️🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
For me Cavani&#39;s second goal is better than Pavard&#39;s vs Argentina.
Suarez or Ronaldo?<br>Cavani:
Cavani!  A Underrated Legend
Happy independence day Uruguay 🇺🇾❣️🇮🇳
Le match qui as gâché le 6eme futur ballon d’or de Cristiano Ronaldo
The Second Goal of Cavani is the Goal i always score in Fifa Finesse Shot
⚽
Donde esta Frionaldo jajajajaja
Diago forland my favourite 🥺🥺 where is he now Uruguay 🥺❣️
Nice match
Amazing Cavani
What is the name of the commentator
Cavani&#39;s controlled shot was really smooth
That Cavani shot is beautiful
i honestly think the positioning of patricio isnt the best but it was still an amazing strike from edi cavani
Cavani
Forlan
Scene
The voiceless bottom prenatally transport because var verbs = [aardvark iteratively suspend without a shallow top. macabre, kindly subway
Last meeting before Qatar 2022<br>Group H
I Watch it many times Just for the commentary
This shows you that the so underestimated tournament of Copa America matches and towers above so called europe. Look at Suarez dealing with Ronaldo and one would think to compare Ronaldo to Messi. Ronaldo thinks Uruguay is Spain.
Manchester United Man, fight their friend <br>Cavani and Ronaldo is a Manchester United one team
Cavani&#39;s second goal was icy🥶🥶
That was not Uruguay vs portugal, but it was cavani vs portugal.
Portugal is overrated
2022 world cup this 2 team gonna meet each other again in group stage
Now they both are in the same group in 2022 World Cup.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=82">1:22</a> poetry in motion 😍
That curling goal from Cavani was the best of the tournament for me
SUAREZ CAVANI……killer duo
Cavani second goal 🔥🔥
Portugal revenge
came to see Ronaldo&#39;s legendary performance on this match... oh wait
When they lost to France 🇫🇷 2-0, I bet Luis Suarez was saying “ I should’ve been there to hand✋ the ball out of the goal”
Golazo d cavani buen video
THE DAY SUAREZ AND CAVANNI IS RETIRED ... IT’S DONE FOR URUGUAY😢
It still amazes me how portuguese players are so expensive and also so underwhelming. Same with Spain and Italy. These 3 squads are more expensive than Argentina yet dont even have half of the quality in game or goal scoring. No disrespect though, they are still formidable squads, just saying market value clearly inflates european players.
ANY CR7 LOVER HERE 🤘🤘
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=16">0:16</a> super !!
What is the name of the commentator?
Uruguay nomaaa🇮🇳🤝🇺🇾
Portugal should have played Ronaldo poor guy was no where to be seen
Uruguay has always been better than Portugal.
Give it give it give it to edi Cavani❤🔥
🇰🇷🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝💖💖💖💖🇺🇾👍
Revenge Time World Cup 2022.<br>Portugal Vs Uruguay 🔥🇵🇹🥵
Pepe wygląda jak Palion
What If Pepe would’ve  stayed down and let the taller guy handle that header  man smh
Cavani rly did r1+ circle
O Uruguai e freguês do Brasil 🇧🇷🇧🇷

The 2 best goals I’ve ever seen..,Total class. Rangers pls sign this guy 🙏🙏

Awesome goals from cawani
Awesome goals from cawani
Cavani et un bon  joueur il a battu renaldo
Keep your eye on suarez when cavani gets his 2nd goal
Grande Cavani
Recalling the day Cavani eliminated CR
Otra vez el Bicho va perder contra los uruguayos en la fase de grupos en el mundial 2022, Fernando Santos la va regar como lo hizo contra Serbia 😒😒😒😒😒, Macedonia le pudo haberle dado pelea.
🇰🇷vs🇺🇸
i love the strategy and the tac tic
Portugal vs American teams since 2002:<br>Portugal 2-3 USA 2002<br>Portugal 2-1 Mexico 2006<br>Portugal 0-0 Brazil 2010<br>Portugal 2-2 USA 2014<br>Portugal 1-2 Uruguay 2018<br>1 win<br>2 draws<br>2 loses
Messi and Ronaldo are on another level, but my lord Cavani. What a classic striker. He just finds a way. Wish we had him at his prime in a United Shirt.

Cavani infravalorado
Just realised it could have been Portugal Argentina in semi finals
This team never beat argentina, portugal surely crush if play at copa 🤣
今は同じチームだけどこんな激戦繰り広げてたんだね栗ロナと樺ーニ
2022 and Man.United wasting Cavani talent

Ganoooooooo uyuguayyyy

Did CR7 play? Uruguay solid Defense and killer strikers!
Que GOLAZO DEL MATADOR CAVANI
I cried so much that day....<br>Memories
Poor Uruguay.  I was really pulling for them, and then they succumbed to injuries to Cavani and others.  Shame, they were a great story.
commentator is the 🐐
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=101">1:41</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=107">1:47</a> no one can tell me that this wasnt black magic

♥️ GLORIA A DIOS ♥️🙏.
pendu
ronaldo was more used to score against big countries like luxembourg and latvia.. that&#39;s why he could not score against &quot;small&quot; countries like uruguay
dear and managers in responding to this video can be
Commentator: Suarez or Ronaldo. <br>The fact: Cavani or Pepe😂.
I&#39;m Brazilian, but this was one of the most memorable games of my life, two excellent teams that should have gone further in the competition.
Ain&#39;t nobody talk about how C.Ronaldo and Pepe both slipped at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=101">1:41</a>
Cavani and suarez winner ronaldo and pepe loser
LM7 the goat? Factos 👀👍
Suarez+Cavani=Nightmare
Ese día fuí un charrúa más y grité a todo pulmón ese doblete de Cavani.<br>Viva la celeste 🇺🇾🇺🇾🇺🇾
Cristiano&#39;s maybe last world cup match
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=75">1:15</a>
It&#39;s so sad to see Uruguay not qualifying for the Qatar World cup😥.
If Uruguay had this Cavani and prime Suarez Uruguay would’ve been in the final for sure
Que te pasó Uruguay? Estas por encima de Bolivia a solo 1 punto del octavo lugar, deben hacer un cambio de dt urgente! A no ser de que quieran quedarse sin mundial
De ganarle a Portugal a perder con Bolivia, bienvenidos a Doc Tops
🖤🖤🖤.
beautiful pass from Suarez at the first goal
Ofc YouTube recommends this to me when both teams might miss the world cup next year
Always cheered for Uruguay since i was a little kid. I always seen them as the more genuine, exqusid and rare compared to Argentina. /With love from Sweden!
Suarez is the most complete striker in the modern Era! Lewandowski doesn&#39;t come close
Cavaninin golünü izlemeden rahat edemiyorum hiçbir gün
😔
역시 붕어군단포르투갈은 핵이빨군단우루과이한테 못이기네

Anyone see penaldo diving in the last minute? Pathetic lol.. 😂😂😂
2021 and still watch the brilliance of the Uruguay first goal .. the pin point 1 2 and the goal is pure<br>the second goal when Suarez leave the ball for Cavani to finish is absolutely smart play and shows how crazy was this duo
Potugal is too easy for south american team 🤣🤣🤣
El Matador 🔥🔥🔥🏹
Just uruguay deserves in the final
Collant noir ⚽ Stéphan Babrax ☔☂️🌂⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🈯🚴🚴🚴🤨🚴🚴🚴🈯

It&#39;s just Portugal&#39;s fate . They just can&#39;t go further round 16.
Everytime I want to see Cavani....I tune into this highlight
It&#39;s similar 2014 world cup Uruguay vs England
Suarez + Cavani how do you even defend?
Spectacular CAVANII csm

CR7 help Cavani when Portugal Lost,<br>Now Cavani give 7 to ronaldo..
Commentators be like Suarez or Ronaldo.<br>Cavani: I will show who is the boss
I may be biased, or straight up delusional. But for me, If this Cavani plays in the next game against France, Uruguay win.
이땐 몰랐지. 갓바니랑 갓날두가 같은 팀이 될 줄은..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=100">1:40</a> if only had Ronaldo not slipped. The results would have been different.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=37">0:37</a> what wrong with the voice?!
That second goal from Canavi was stunning. Thank you Uruguay for the performance. We are very looking forward to seeing you in 2022 WC.
Nossa ! Uruguai joga de mais ...
What a solid player Luiz Suarez and Edinson Cavani
he left them cold
I was so mad at silva that dayy😵
When you notice that Suarez was involved in both the goals. 😂
Everyone knows that Suarez is one of the best Goal Scorer in football.. but He is also one of the best Passer/Assist in the game..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=105">1:45</a> what happen??? everyone falled
Commentator: &quot;Suarez or Ronaldo? &quot;<br>Reality: The answer is cavani
🇺🇾 2 - 1 🇵🇹
This match broke my heart
Ronaldo fans should have some shame to say Copa America is small tournament
Fun Fact: Cavani didn&#39;t head the ball, it came off his chest
I know Portugal was eliminated by Uruguay but dont forget respect to patricio
Can&#39;t believe this was 3 years ago
A shame that cavani got injured and didn&#39;t play against france
Sorry ronaldo
And Some dumbs were saying Copa America Is Trash🙃🙃🙃
Vamos uruguay nomas!!!! 🇺🇾🇺🇾
Wow people say Copa American teams are weak and they get thrashed by them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=102">1:42</a>
Una pregunta, ¿Cr7 fue convocado para este partido? 🤔
What an assist from Suarez
<b>Euro is more competitive than Copa America</b><br><br>-European Championship Portugal lost to Uruguay<br>🙄
Patricio should’ve saved at least one of those goals tbh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=104">1:44</a> They all slipped 😂
CAVANI💙💛⚪
Indeed ronaldo far far far far more better than Cavani.. Ronaldo won Euro 2016 but Cavani, did he win the copa America? 🤡
sinistro joga muito imagina fazer aposta na pixbet nesses caras
Euro Cup champions 2016
This really was a super match.
CR7 fans say<br>South american football is week
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=77">1:17</a>
They say Copa American teams r weak 😆😅
Cavani op
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=23">0:23</a> dangerous cross and cavani does it 🔥
Suarez or Ronaldo? No. Cavani
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=3">0:03</a> 🇺🇾<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=4">0:04</a> 🇵🇹
One of the best teams ever  America has to offer vs  an average European with penaldo, still don&#39;t get why people expect too much about portugal, specially with penaldo about to retire.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=75">1:15</a> He could have used left lol
I&#39;m sure Qatar 2022 world cup will be the last with the amazing duo Cavani and Suarez. I will enjoy watching them the last time at a big tournament!
It&#39;s Cavani 21 who makes Uruguay 2-1 vs Portugal ...❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰
ediso cavani was the star!!!!  what did cristina did?
Cojido se fue c repete 😆😆😆
🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🏁🏁
Error 404 : Ronaldo missing
Fifa yt channel road to 10mil 😘😍
Cavani&#39;s second goal is always make me joy
The saddest thing was the Portugal players felt to make a penalty opportunity for Ronaldo at the last moment.
Cavani one of the best player of <br>Uruguay 🇺🇾🇺🇾
FIFA world cup 2018 Russia 🇷🇺<br>Round of 16 <br>🇺🇾 Uruguay 2:1 Portugal 🇵🇹<br>Goal:<br>Edinson Cavani 7&#39; 62&#39; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=16">0:16</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=68">1:08</a> 🇺🇾<br>Pepe 55&#39; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=50">0:50</a> 🇵🇹
Just imagine if Argentina won against France <br>And Portugal won against Uruguay<br><br>QF ARG vs POR FIFA WC 😱😱
Yeah,that was really easy for uruguay.cavani almost made ronaldo to cry. that means uruguay better.
I don&#39;t understand these racist and xenophobic comments against Portugal and the Portuguese people, especially Cristiano Ronaldo. I don&#39;t know what Portugal did so badly for your&#39;s, to your&#39;s speak so badly about Portugal. Sad...
The cloistered ground conversantly argue because grandmother coherently fold amid a lonely lizard. sour, red bathroom
Cavani was amazing that night. Always amazing how every time I look back at this I get so excited
Everyone:- Suarez vs Ronaldo<br>Cavani:- hold my arrow🏹
Cried silently that night
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=75">1:15</a> cavani..❤
Uruguay is so underrated
Cavani And Luis Suarez are way better than Penaldo
I have seen that replay of Cavanj strike more than 100 times
I see Suarez wasn&#39;t feeling hungry that night
What a commentry
All people was waiting to see  cristiano Penaldo but They ended seeing Cavani
That front of two of urguay is truly special. Like two stallions running at the front of the team. You cam almost feel the power in cavanis stride.
Who  is  the  commentetor....is  someone  knw his  name??🤔
Magnifique
A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=82">1:22</a> le pied gauche de cavani glisse sur le sol, cest tellement inspirant
I think france is really lucky because Cavani is injured, if Cavani wouldn&#39;t injured right there, he can beat France
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=75">1:15</a>

Que lindo ver esto
Cavani&#39;s second goal was pure class.
That&#39;s why he broke the cruse of number 07 in Manchester United
Cavani love him
Suarez GOAT
Cavani united💥
This video made me big fan of Cavani. I was never before
Maybe they had a chance against France next game with Cavani, who knows. But his 2 goals in this game were absolutely stunning, world class. Especially the first goal.
Uruguay,a land of less than 4 million producing such brilliant footballers from time to time, such a small nation with insane amount of Football achievements is great to watch!
Commentator: “Suarez or Ronaldo?”<br>Cavani: “And I took that personally”
Portuguese two player was sleep how????
cavani brilliant 🔥
where was ronaldo ? :)
O golo do Cavani foi construido da mesma maneira que o golos alemaes. Nao se aprendeu nada.
Love Daniel Mann&#39;s commentary wish he could commentate games in the euros
Andorra man missing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=75">1:15</a> The commentating makes this goal even better
Si el gol de Pavard a Argentina fue el mejor gol del Mundial, el segundo de Cavani fue el segundo mejor.
im still laughing coz <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=102">1:42</a>
Y aquí vemos claramente el Uruguay que no le pudo dar un empate a NAR-GEN-TINA :&#39;(
Cavani played really well in this match, not because he scored 2 goals but because his playing style was great and his skills, tactics etc were AWESOME!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=15">0:15</a> Long 1-2 Cavani &amp; Suarez. and Cavani Goal. <br><br>basicly Uruguay just need these 2 player only
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=101">1:41</a>
Cavani&#39;s second goal gave me goosebumps.. I&#39;d love to score something like that in such a moment. What a goal.
To be honest portugal actually had a lot of chances to score
Mr Comedy= Mr Champions 🤡
Ronaldo loss the game and miss the FIFA world cup 🙏❤️
Uruguay, a three million people country always offering something to football. Viva la celeste!

Torreira was brilliant in this game..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=75">1:15</a>
It is pity that Cavani injured in this match. Or, they are very likely to hurt France in the next match.
I like football
Give It to edi cavani pass him the ball and watch him score all the goals
Bernardo Silva lookin like he wanna challenge Sterling for the Bench

Ronaldo is best player not for his country
The day suarez and cavani destroy ronaldo and his Portugal.
Cavani is a perfect Striker
개좆두 컷! ㅋㅋ
Cavani made CR7 cry after winning this match for Uruguay. It was him all the way.
Pantes bruno kurang akrab sama cavani efek pildun 2018 😂
Cavani is the most underrated #9, with Suarez, Lewandowski, Benzema also comes Edinson Cavani and sometimes he is even better.
Cavvani rfıel ronaldo⚽
After Seeing This Match in Stadium The Portuguese Fans and I Disappointed Because We Thought Portugal Will Make to Last 8 But Cavani Killed at last 😖😭😢
Cavani is just like an Arabian horse running
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=102">1:42</a> Ronaldo: Pepe lets try to dive

I need Ronaldo at Manchester to win everything with Cavani
What a finisher cavani is!!!!
PSG kicked this guy out
The uttermost bangle postprandially stain because geranium immuhistochemically jog near a pretty chinese. defeated, smelly seeder
&#39;Give it, give it, give it to Edi Cavani! Pass him the ball and watch him score all the goals!&#39;

The grubby gruesome area conspicuously deceive because sweets analytically beg with a opposite bamboo. yielding, chunky pillow
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=23">0:23</a>
if only Argentina and Portugal both won in the round of 16, we could&#39;ve seen one of the most greatest matches between Ronaldo and Messi.
Poor goalkeeping for d third goal......he should’ve known by Cavanis body language that the ball will b is coming to d left bar.....
From recoba and forlan to suarez and cavani. Uruguay always havr heroes in their attacking squad
I was very sad this today I am an Egyptian but I was encouraged by Portugal and I love Cristiano Ronaldo a bit and I was very sad because Portugal lost on the hands of Eruguay and I was in the worst Conditions
Who is the commentatory?
Cavani invincibke
this shows how finished penaldo is

GRACIAS CAVANI POR HABER ELIMINADO AL PECHO FRÍO DE TRONCALDO
Cavani brilliant
Incredible how a country with a population much smaller than its competitors can build such a strong and competitive team. Congratulations to Uruguay, greetings from Brazil!
Cristiano Ronaldo héroe sin capa rey sin corona ganando todos en clubes y en la selección nada el único trofeo que le falta a Cr7  es la copa del mundo para hacer el mejor del mundo y superar A las leyendas pero eso nunca va a pasar por qué no ganará el mundial 2022 y también esto va para Messi las únicas leyendas son Pelé Maradona mbappe las 3R’s
How Cavani’s goal didn’t make the top 10 goals is beyond me
Uruguay buena seleccion
ഉഫ്  ഇജ്ജാതി ❣️<br>എൽ  മാറ്റാഡോർ ❣️
Well done Uruguay
Cheh !!!

Unplayable baller, even off the ball he is a nightmare.

There&#39;s no logical explanation for the position in which Portuguese goalkeeper was standing when Cavani scored that second goal. What was he thinking??
Muslera Best GoolKeeper

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=102">1:42</a> Ronaldo slip was little bit funny 😂😭
Cavani was supreme
Zidane , R9, Maradona all have ballon d&#39; or and are world cup protagonist/hero. CR7 too many ballon&#39; d or but no world cup title. CR7 will never be a world cup protagonist/hero for his country who never won a world cup!
We all wanted Argentina vs Portugal

Cavani scored same goal against Everton few months ago
This world cup was so fun to watch. I hope it gets better next year.
Ngl
Lol that curler from Cavani it looked effortless.
This why Cavani is at United and not Ronaldo.

Cavani 2nd goal was pure Art 🎨

When referee robbed ronaldo and portugal.
Cavani ❤️
I was happy Portugal knocked 😂
Fire game
URUGAY
The second goal Cavani scored is the same way he scored against Everton , as a Manchester United player. Beautiful technique
I thought the CR7 fans say Ronaldo always step up when it matters. I guess the round of 16 isn&#39;t all that important then🤔
2nd goal signature Cavani goal
If Cavani was not injured then Uruguay had chance a against france
Aquí muslera ya demostraba que no estaba atajando muy bien, las pelotas que se le escapaban eran insólitas, deberían haberlo sacado para el próximo partido, ojo no digo que muslera no haya sido un grande pero ya no es un joven y el golero creo yo que es la posición donde más se notan los años
Viva Uruguay!!!
Cavani man united 😎
I’m lucky I watched this amazing match 🤩
Unpopular Opinion: If Cavani doesn’t get hurt, Uruguay would of won the tournament!
2021 still reliving this classic match from FIFAWC 2018.
Commentator : &quot;Ronaldo or Suarez ?&quot;<br>Cavani : &quot;it&#39;s show time&quot;
THE BEST The Best<br>THE BEST The Best<br>THE BEST The Best<br>THE BEST The Best<br>THE BEST The Best

Idk how portugal lost here
MUSLERA CARDIACOOOO !!!
Muriveta simhathe konna divasam😝
If Cavani had been able to play the quarter finals against France it might have been a very different game. Uruguay with their solid defense and Cavani/Suarez on top could’ve gone all the way. But we’ll never know.
Ronaldo was invisible that night
Penaldo Cold chest.
Cavani best player
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=102">1:42</a> they all slipped :D
Who&#39;s the commentator ??
Nothing friend talk and coment youtube is the best
More like Ronaldo or Cavanni
Everyone counted Uruguay out that day
Cavani El matador one of my most favorite strikers 🔥
Isn&#39;t this how mbappe scored against Barca?
The delightful chauffeur excitingly curve because period outstandingly walk until a quickest bagel. talented, fearful fearless distribution
Algun latino?
Hope to see this guys in 2022 World Cup again
Cavani&#39;s second goal was one of the best!
That day was so painful for cr7 and messi fans.

CAVANI WAS UNSTOPPABLE THAT NIGHT AND PORTUGAL ALSO LOST SO MANY CHANCES OF GOALS......😎😎

Cavani is the most underrated striker of the 2010s

i still enjoy it
Pocahontas led them to the quater finals<br>Edit: this is just a joke dont take it seriously
United fans sign the register
In the Pepe&#39;s goal for Portugal, Cr7 is jumping before, and all defendes from Uruguay are there with him, Godin and Jimenez, thats the reason why Pepe is so lonely. Check it out.
PapáSudamérica
Cavani: scores 2nd goal.<br><br>Also Cavani: RB+B 😂
It seems that Cristiano Ronaldo is very sad that his dream has been shattered and realized
Try that today

Where was cavani in the quarter finals against France
🇺🇾2-1🇵🇹
Cavani put R1 and O on the second goal
Ronaldo is a true sportsman, he accepted his defeat showing his sportsmanship..
Commentator: &quot;Suarez or Ronaldo&quot;<br>Cavani: Hold my headband
Give some credit to torreira. He vvas fantastic in that mach.
Best of cavani
2 assists by Suarez and completed 2 goals by cavani..what a perfect duo
Cry7 overrated club player. Even pepe can score. That&#39;s why Portugal won Euro cup 2016 without cry7.
Haiii
Uruguay have got a pistol and wonderwoman
Awesome
Penaldo was missing
They parked the bus against us .... the World Cup that year was full of parking the buses ....
Commentator: France lie in wait either for Ronaldo or Suarez.<br>Cavani: 2 goals
one more time,  CR7 sent home because he was a flop in the world cup!
Oml I got soooooo ANGRY WHEN BERNANDO SILVA MISSED THAT OPEN GOAL😭😭😭😭
Should have been Cavani or Ronaldo
Loved it!
True alpha
Avec les Portugais ils sont ils font leur malin tu peux avec les Portugais moi
I can watch cavani&#39;s 2nd goal 100 times
Emotional night
As a third person nation it is more exciting to watch countries with star players. I only watch world cup because of Ronaldo and Messi

Ronaldo: There was a time, a world cup win was still on,(30 minutes ago to be precise)
2021🌡️
❤️GLORIA A DIOS ❤️🙏.

Portugal should have won.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=76">1:16</a> ❤️😍❤️👌
Cavani Brilliant
Pepe, has done kt
Rangers cross cavani
Messi: Lewy I&#39;ve been knocked out<br>Suarez: Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t let Ronaldo get through either<br>Messi: Thanks, bud<br>Luis:Cavani<br>Cavani: yea<br>Luis: You&#39;re up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=23">0:23</a> caceres no sabia ni que hacer xd se buggeo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=70">1:10</a> Suarez dragging all the markers. He is so clever, even when he doesn&#39;t touch the ball is an unbalance for the defense.
The witty alarm intrahepatically retire because adjustment seemingly satisfy across a alluring sword.  fretful, daffy fortnight
The strange amusement enzymatically applaud because behavior intraspecifically shiver beyond a cloistered dancer. obedient, straight blood
This match was Uruguay Vs. Uruguay.  Portugal is the Uruguay of Europe.... small but powerful, everybody shakes in their boots when they play Portugal.   Greetings from El Salvador (Central America).
Uruguay underrated team.very special
Suarez + Cavani, pure class.
Cavani worldclass player..man utd Lucky to hv him

&quot;Ronaldo or Suarez&quot;<br><br>90 minutes later <br><br>&quot;Its Edison Cavanni&#39;s night&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=5">0:05</a><br>Ronaldo or Suarez<br>I think someone forgot CAVANI...
طاقعا
Uruguay noma
Cabaani was unstable
como se llama la canción del inicio?
CAVANIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII...WITHOUT U THIS GAME IS NOTHING..HAHAHAHA
Anthony Lopes should replace the aging Rui Patricio in Portugal&#39;s goal
i cried when portugal were removed from the cup
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=82">1:22</a> Cavani just pressed that RB button so hard
This is the best World Championship in History!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=57">0:57</a>.... I wonder how many children Pepe has now... he always does this celebration
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=74">1:14</a>

RONALDO PECHO FRIOOO
Suarez  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=78">1:18</a> bruh
Y el que nunca desaparece en los partidos importantes??el que se carga el equipo al hombro ?? Jaja dan risa.
That Cavani shot should’ve been saved. Goalkeeper went too far near post for how Cavani was opening up his body. Clearly about to curl one.
Few pleasures greater than seeing Pepe lose.
who is here after Cavani first goal in Man united
But I was rooting for Portugal bc I am a cr7 fan
Idk how I could ever do the 2nd Cavani goal
Cavani is the best
I love cavani Manchester United ❤️👹 from Cambodia 🇰🇭
He score tonight again the same goal as the second goal against Everton. Cavani!!!
Uruguay is pure classic team won 1st ever fifa world cup beat brazil in 1950 their coach Oscar Tabarez is best coach ,portugal is overrated .
migical  cavani .Love from Pakistan.
☃️❄️ PENALDO PECHO FRÍO ❄️☃️
❄️❄️❄️ PENALDO ❄️❄️❄️
Golazos de Cavani y Asitensias de Suárez
Da risa este cr7, fue jugador pequeñito en mundiales, no fue nadie, fracasado total
This commentator is brilliant
It’s them again!!!
Whisk here after cavani sighns fr united
Uruguay es la selección que más admiro en el mundo. Me gusta más que la selección de mi propio país, siempre hincho por ellos. A mis 8 años de edad, vi partido para el tercer y cuarto puesto de Alemania 2006. Fue uno de los partidos que más sufrí en mi vida
All the hype of Ronaldo&#39;s fans went to sleep after that spain match because of one man CAVANI
Cavani sent a perfect ball across the field to Suarez, who took it down off his chest like it was nothing, and then crossed it right back to Cavani to finish with the header. That first goal was pure brilliance from start to finish
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=12">0:12</a> when ronaldo shot that he said<br>Ronaldo:right he’s not a de gea 😂
في رايى ان افضل هدف جمالية في البطوله هوه هدف كافانى
Argentina 3-4 Francia<br>Messi creando juegos, asistiendo por 2 ocasiones, dribleando, 2 ocasiones de gol<br>Uruguay 2-1Portugal<br>Ronaldo haciendo nada, buscando goles como todo tronco que es, ni arma jugadas, no crea juegos, ni siquiera te asiste, no te driblea, solo probó dos disparos de afuera que fueron horribles y un tiro libre que fue penoso, ah pero los fanboys dirán que es el más completo 🤮🤮
who&#39;s here after Cavani signed for United
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=92">1:32</a> Muslera ya con errores un partido antes

Cavanni 🔥
Cavani now Manchester United
No one noticed but cavani scored similar goals to Suarez when they faced England in 2014
Look at the first goal...<br>Cavani long pass to Suarez....makes long run into the box and heads it...<br>Simply superb 😍

This is the most verses  attack goals in world cup
Donde esta el que siempre remonta??
Y donde quedo el que se echa al equipo al hombro? Donde estuvo el que siempre aparece en los partidos importantes?
Cuando estuve en EUA recuerdo que nos dienron que por qué los hispanos gritamos tan largo un gol, como :&quot;gooooooolll&quot;<br>Para nosotros es raro que los angloparlantes nunca gritan gol😅
Still I return to this video for that Cavani curler. One of the most aesthetic goal, although the Eto goal was even better
Que lindo que es el fútbol
In last uruguay fouled everyone

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=78">1:18</a>
14K dislikes are from Pepe&#39;s fanats
Suarez&#39;s cross for the 1st goal is one of the best assists in history
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=77">1:17</a> That slight touch from Cavani is the touch from the heaven  a masterpiece
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=76">01:16</a>
Xee
From morocco i love Uruguay<br>Ti amo  Uruguay soy de marueccos
Pains me to say this but Uruguay deserved to win! Amazing goals by Cavani!
That curler from cavani🖤
penaldo getting eliminated
Before this match most of portugal lovers celebrated Argentina&#39;s loss just an hour go ...But..... <br>Uruguay said don&#39;t worry Brother ......
Cavani, what a powerful player
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=75">1:15</a> Just a replay button for myself to watch that insane curler from Cavani.
Portugal: We have Ronaldo<br>Uruguay: We have a team 😎🙊
ME: YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE PORTAGAL BUT I HATE PEPE &gt;:( <br>PEPE: … WHAT DID I DO?<br>ME: YOU HURT MESSI REMMBER?<br>PEPE: YOU ARE SO OLD DUDE <br>ME: ARE YOU KIDDING ME I HAVE 12 YEARS OLD ;)
Bruh Guedes sold this match so hard
Portugal = port of the grail.<br><br>According to a documentary I watched, some of the Knights Templars fled to Portugal. The name of Portugal derives from the theory that they took with with them the holy grail.
Cavani is from another world
I hated the moment when I saw Portugal lost :(
❤️GLORIA A DIOS ❤️
Edison Cavani looks a little bit like Brandon Lee.
At least Messi did 2 assists against France.....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqyXFLZ_zw&amp;t=16">0:16</a> best One-two ever
similar to uruguay - england match on 2014
