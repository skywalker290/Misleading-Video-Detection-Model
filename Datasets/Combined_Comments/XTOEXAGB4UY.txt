I am from Nepal and i am really disappointed for her, sorry for disrespect but it was all because of too much stress due to poor conditions of transportation <br>The main reason behind is our f**king useless government
here money is more than humanity.   bull shit ,,,,,all human go to hell
Typical briton travelling around like they own the place
150 nepal rupee= 1.01 pound . why did she even bargain that?
Let me explain what she is saying in video the owner.. she is chasing them away not actually hitting them and no she don&#39;t intend to hit if you watched the video you will know by her gestures! <br><br>She is angry and asking why did she take photo of shop? and as she chase tourist further she says why you bargain 50rs and 150rs for black tea? You don&#39;t know? this isn&#39;t Kathmandu, Pokahara or Manang (these places are famous tourist destination)  but this is mountain I have to pay 2000rs for a yak to bring stuff up here. I had to bring all sugar and tea etc then she swears at her asking why you bargain? <br>Owner says many tourist come here they give me 1000/2000rs free (I&#39;m assuming its a tips she got by other tourist) but you no tourist you are donkey. <br>While tourist lady begs her that she is threatening her son but owner actually says multiple times that your son no problem it&#39;s you who have no brain! your son is very good it&#39;s you! you come and ask for discount to everybody  you think Nepali people aren&#39;t people? As tourist says she is sorry and she is leaving owner says go fast then go go! <br>Most of it owner says in broken English if you watch video! <br><br>Often in mountain area due to small community they take matter in their own hands to deal with! So always be humble! If you&#39;re not sure just ask nicely!
i swear she said harry potter at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTOEXAGB4UY&amp;t=235">3:55</a>
Don&#39;t care about the back story. The brown woman was wrong. Period.
Violence is wrong but I&#39;m sure the British chick had a rude attitude until the angry grandma chased her.
why would u visit napal any damn why
Which anime is this? Great opening episode
Damn i should go to starbuck and ask why they charge more than the cafe next door.
New Adventure of Lara Croft in Playstation 5:D
I have no sympathy for this woman. She can afford to travel but she can&#39;t afford to pay for fucking tea?
Some don&#39;t understand that transporting goods to the mountains cost a lot of money. Getting potable water is hard enough. The Brit woman should have brought her own tea, water and burner if she doesn&#39;t want to spend at all.  And probably the amount of that tea isn&#39;t as expensive as it is in her own country. She should not have left her country if she&#39;s going to be this disrespectful to the locals.
Just to get some like and view you are spoling my country name please don&#39;t share sach vedio  Nepal has main way of income is toures....
Could she not pay the money and just leave rather than saying sorry a million times and recording with her GoPro? She is the  one stealing from this poor lady that gave her a place to stay and she&#39;s also playing the victim. People like her deserve a little ass whopping! Don&#39;t fucking travel if you don&#39;t have the money to pay for your tea. I&#39;m sure the Nepalese women did not enjoy chasing her but there is no way she could have justice overhere.
the ting go skrrrrap! papapapapa!
15 years old son cannot protect his mum? Fucking useless
&quot;Youre scaring my son&quot;<br>Bitch, let her complain, mountain life is hard. English people have all the damn money in the world but wont pay for their damn drinks. No one cares if you say sorry, no one cares if your son is scared, you dont do that shit in your country, dont do it in Nepal
the reaction is a bit.. well, extreme.. but jesus, just pay the fucking 2 bucks for the tea that the &quot;lady&quot; asked and dont try to save money with the poorest ppl living on a fucking mountain..she obviously has the money to travel around and buy gear and clothes for walking and stuff.. k, enough, gotta go get my coffee from starbucks for like 6bucks
All this because of about 60 pence. Haha, silly lady.
This bitch freaked cause of a picture? Stfu...
