My man. Maybe you completely missed the point of &#39;Tohfa.&#39; It was the highest-grossing film of the year...1984. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s an Orwellian propaganda film made for the masses with the approval from the masters, with a vile agenda to normalise sexual violence by trivialising it and even making it comedic, thus adding to the prevalent narrative that supported the skewed gender politics and served the men. That&#39;s the only explanation, right? RIGHT?
Misandrists everywhere ü§¢
Bullshit video!

@Jammy you have been focusing on 90s and 80s movies. Please make a video on the KOFFEE WITH KARAN&#39;S EPISODE ON- HARDIK PANDIYA&#39;S COMMENTS ON WOMEN
they basically tried to provide some substitution of porn in that time ü§£ü§£
K.Raghavendra Rao was a legend in all ways seeing him direct these kinds of movies is shameful to us the Telugu Audience

In the same history of Bollywood how Hero being SIMP is propagated as heroism &amp; being women propagated as victim angel.
Each father who is indifference with mother mostly be perceived as misogyny even by his son.<br>Gynocentric evolution.<br>On No matter for what ever sexual/gender conflict which their children don&#39;t even know, when a couple quarrel with each other, <br>they mostly find it&#39;s a father who fights with mother.
How young generation men&#39;s perception of keep on cultivated by women-centric ideology from his previous generation men.<br>What will be the perception of a scene where a woman express how she is going to have sex with him &amp; the man express joy?<br>acceptable role change? or funny? what makes the difference is what makes remaining difference too[gender theory of relativity]
These movie scenes disgusted me so much I legit started crying.
Indian movies are a torture in that sense
If you point out things in movies than everything is rubbish in every bollywood movies don&#39;t say they potray women badly they potray men as a wolf also every bollywood movies has racism and they degraded muslims in there every movies
Brother you just can&#39;t ask for explanation of a movie from 90s in 2021 cause the perspective has changed a lot.
These things are disturbing and disgusting for us, but unfortunately vulgarity didn&#39;t got solved but even got worst because the audience accepted it and even liked it and demanded more of it indirect way. That&#39;s the reason who way notice in today&#39;s times may be the censor board got strict but online platforms like hotshots and many more showing vulgarity in bulk and these numbers is not adding it&#39;s multiplying day-by-day.<br>People with sound mind will not accept it and try his best to avoid these but we should admit that we are living in sexually decoyed era where if you are online some way or the other you will encounter with sexual content which will ultimately fill the mind with garbage if you not control it.<br>And lastly it is also very much true that rapes, eve-teasing, molestation for both men and women is a cause of these vulgarity shown and still streaming in the name of modeling, social media influencing, webseries, college and school romance movies and many more.<br>We can raise our voice easily against religion and history so why can&#39;t for the actual reason which damaging minds of young generation, no but will never do thia because some on the other even your dark side likes this vulgarity, isn&#39;t
It&#39;s sense her board. Not censor board.
I think I am in a temporary coma due to blood loss in my brain, someone help.

Basically they ruined the status of moving or chalchitra movies which , great creator Mr.Dadasaheb Falke dreamed of ..<br>Bollywood can&#39;t understand what Shree. Dadasaheb Falke did to bring this technology in India.. Bollywood just spoiled his efforts. <br>I am glad that I have stopped watching Bollywood movies but also sad to know that foreigners thinks  Bollywood is great...
&quot;Mera aisa bhagya kaha&quot; I don&#39;t even know how this actress played this role... These scenes are the reason boys think whatever they do women will die hard for them
Most of u in comment section who watches not only normal but different category most commonly the forced or sleep or step which in real life is called rape then too u r here to judge the 90s movie and not the web series of alt balaji ,ullu and many more in which their are basically &quot;sex stories &quot; and different fantasies which can make the individual realise that those fantasies can come to real life too
I am happy that i am neither among ur so judging society and not in the era of 90&#39;s

Pakaa ‡§¶‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ aapne
I think you should make video on tag line dialogues given to goons like Shakti Kapoor and Gulshan Grover in 80,s or 90,s. Like ganna chooss ke, rabdi khake,tail lgake, zindagi ka mazza to khatte mei hi hai,khashboo lgake,huuaa huaaaa
Thank you for the Content. Got to Hell Bollywood
It actually blown my mind..<br>The no. of rape scenes in 80s &amp; 90s movies would probably more than actual cases.<br>Also it might be the reason of increased rape cases in India from 2000s as at that time movies used influence people more than a politician&#39;s speech..
I think Muqadma tried to pull off a desi version of I Spit On Your Grave.
Worthless topics
I don&#39;t get one thing, why did all these villains have a tilak, this sacred symbol is tormented and damaged beyond repair to an extent that whenever I see a man with a tilak I perceive him as a gangster or criminal.

There are good movies also jwel theif , don, hakikat which best of 90s
Boycott bollywood
Mid 80‚Äôs till mid 90‚Äôs gave such shitty movies that I really moved on to english and gradually into foreign language films... Main stream directors producers and some actors have been totally shitty since then till today... In between came directors like Vishal Bharadwaj and Anurag Khashyap and some more is when Indian cinema came off shit.. Thanks to them...
Movies are just reflection of society. Don&#39;t blame movies..
Please keep introduction short
Please talk about sexism against men also! It&#39;s also prevalent in one out of 3 movies.
90s is a era of using violence to each other specially by a man to woman and finally that woman fell in love a man who is using violence on her with condition of lead role of the film honestly
Disgusting. How the fuck is she saying balatkar kya hota hy bc anpadh log bhi jante hy. Sucha dumbass tow accept the role. 3rd class actors.

Society is a subject which is evolving in nature. Down the line people will comment 2020&#39;s generation were buffon as they were busy in concept of marriage, bearing a child and had contributed immense in destroying environment while catching a good flick in theatre  having plastic packaging product,with plastic straw and praising, oh what a creative cinema..this is called filmmaking..but HOLA ..who are the audience..urbane or rural which country like india still represent..Agrarian and i was still amused how come a hero jumps from 10 storey building..I used to clap..later on i watched dhobi ghat..now i am sensible but lost all the innocence and busy on social media and taking selfies...
Everyone agrees, that these scenes are  not to be made, but why only men are  always blamed for every crime, I agree that some men are criminals, but why every girl is a sati Savitri, the actresses who are playing the  vamps and sex toys of villain, why  they are agreeing to do these scenes in the first place
Now i understand why north india has so many sexual harassments crime rate . ofcourse next is hyderabad in the list.
Don&#39;t think much about bollywood
TBH, it&#39;s really hard for my to watched this 8min Video... I don&#39;t know how to watched these movies to make this vid. Geez, I pissed off üò™üò™
I used to watch a lot of these random movies on set max zee cinema etc as a child. I remember these scenes left me traumatized and I used to feel extremely conscious whenever someone unknown was even looking at me
Going to the theatres to watch a movie with your family was pretty much the only pastime of the masses back then. Its disturbing to think that parents probably took their kids along watched such rubbish. Wtf was the censor board doing?
Well thi eight minute video was hard to get through... Can&#39;t believe people used to watch in fact love this shit... Thank God I was born in this era where things are better

I think that the Bollywood movies made in between 70s to 90s had a huge impact on the mindset and the belives of that generation...

Tumhe Bollywood nahi Hollywood ke bare me discuss karna chaiye <br>Dear English Medium
I understand what you are saying here, but your content is repetitive and you are trying to condemn an era instead of condemning the movies. I am pretty sure there would be movies today as well that are pathetic (not misogynistic though, but tasteless selfish insecure)

No wonder there are people who still think its normal to sexually assault women, if they say no to the initial sexual advances of men. These movies reinforce their ideals which were already regressive and demented.
Bollywood üí©
Disgusting!
The rape/assault scenes were not included because &#39;that&#39;s what a villain does&#39; - they were included to titillate, since romantic/consensual sexual scenes could not be shown due to censors...so rape and assault were the way to show sex.
I dont know why in every bollywood movie they have to show women gettting raped then hero saving her or she taking revenge. Why can women be strong from beginning of movie????
Guys, such characters exist in real life. Some even more cruel. And movies are characterizations. You show cruelty and strength on the side of villain and virtues and strength on the side of the hero. Such scenes are there in movies all around the world and worse, the real world is even more cruel. Right from the era of mythologies till date, nothing has changed.
Bollywood unfortunately lacked content ...in 80s to 90s ... They had ready formula..one rape , two fights , 4 songs , 1 villain... thankfully it improved during 2000 ... But not much ... Now the formula is to copy from south...add more budget and masala ..bro seriously how you can review so many worst movies üò≠
Thank you for touching this topic. So much of harassment against women has been going on since decades. Then and now women have always been used as an object. Molestation, eve teasing, rape scenes etc were so part of the movies to cater audiences. Even now ironically that legacy goes on in songs like gandi baat etc. These days web series cover up all these aspects so much so that people don&#39;t feel need to watch porn. Don&#39;t what&#39;s going to happen to present and future generations. But yes 80s and 90s era of movies was disgusting with a mandatory 5-10 min rape scene in it. Could never watch a movie with family.<br>Guess people like us need to restart the movie industry with good ideas, themes, scripts, dialogues which will reshape the future generation. Keep up the good work!
I am in a minority but I find these scenes pretty entertaining, funny and erotic. Yes, I know we have to posture that how it is so regressive and cringeworthy but deep down you clicked on the video because it offers something which you like and dislike at the same time. Great video though keep it coming.
The Kishan Kumar movie scene is good. Both actors slapping each other roots for gender parity.
Indian cinema is still logic less. Absurdism is it synonym.
Hahahahahahaha<br>Hahhahahahaha
Wtf your chanle stupeda
They lived with adventure, not live a nerd&#39;s life in a cubicle.
You have to improve your accent, dude
Pant bhai, tu bolta bahut hai. Video chalne do na. Tum irritate kar dete ho itna zyada bol k.
In Rural areas people still watch all these kind of movies of 80s to 90s, where molestation and rape was treated as a weapon to show their manhood...people watching such content have that mindset of objectification of women even in 2020.<br>Such content should be banned.
AAP CHUTIYE HAIN
Abli nari, wtfüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This Era of Bollywood is full of perverts, idiots, uneducated etc...
That era of Bollywood movies was bizarre. There are still so many movies which basically have female roles only to be the love interest and attract male audience. It&#39;s sad knowing that Bollywood cannot differentiate between nonsense and practicality and apparently, so does majority of that audience.
Angrez ki aulad
I am happy that my mother never allowed us to watch indian movies, only hollywood action, sci fiction or horror. Those horror movies were less traumatic than these indian movies.üôÑ
You have to be lauded to watch such cringe worthy movies for creating your content
You speak well but you speak more than required
Try n Speak in hindi you&#39;ll get more views
bhai too much talking...try to show some scenes also...we dont have courage to watch these movies.

Why u don&#39;t say anything about reverse sexism, men are beaten by women projected as brave and reverse as abuse
90s Bollywood: Zero fucks given...<br>I miss the 90s, when we had professional villains doing the deeds. We need more rape scenes in cinema nowadays.
Kya tum Angrej ki aulad Ho Hindi nahin bol Sakte
STOP THE FUCK getting inspired by movies you brainless people . This is the reason why my society is full of headless people just take it as entertainment and you creators you filled some useless minds with wrong thoughts which they dont have capacity to understand on first place you are the one explaining to them which they will never get it on its own its like you making more sexiest people then already there are its like you poking psychopath dog who is forgot he is psychopath and sleeping just to remember hin and eat you hole üôè
To Tried&amp;refused production why you  torture your self by watching such dumb movies you are wasting time even pepole dont watch such movie in theatre.
Sir, the 2000 film mela was also one of the movie as mentioned in your video. I was shocked to see Amir Khan and Twinkle Khanna in lead role üò±üò±
Today&#39;s Bollywood is too as shameless as it was back then. Just like hollywood. No class, only sleaze
that ape scene just made me vomit
I think the dislikers on ur channel are the hardcore bollywood fans....lol
How is this conscience awakening attempted through criticising the old generation movies going to change the current generation with even more perverted mindset that enjoys watching pornstars and &#39;deep-thoat-Malaika&#39; in movies. The soul of humanity is perverted and .... May there be one more Great Flood... AMEN
Thank God I didn&#39;t watch these bizzare movies
There was no social media, if it was there these movies would have made millions and become viral.
These  type  of scenes  in movies  provoke gang  rape in India Bollywood  featuring only  sex in movies  and  web series.
These guys can make a porn star also a heroine in their films
I grew up watching Hindi movies with all those horrible and shocking scenes. Even that time I felt that so much injustice was shown of women in Hindi movies. Now I‚Äôm living in Australia there‚Äôs so much respect for women
You should make on plagiarism in Bollywood movie
The last scene from &#39;Tohfa&#39; left me speechless! How can they think of such a scene! They are making fun of such a sensitive issue, this is why I never watch movies, the dirty and cheap mindset of bollywood has still not changed, just their way of objectifying women has changed.
So irritating movies
At that time scenes was shit now whole movie is shit

n that time cinema&#39;s culture was in trend üòï how they digest the scenes  in public ...Oh my god!
These fuckingüò†ü§¨rapists that exist in our society should be given even more cruel punishments.

Kya kya dekhna padta h bhai tmko!
How do you dig up such movies?üòÉüòÉüòÉ
Bollywood have time and again showcase Eve Teasing, Molestation and even rape as normal culture in Indian Society and that weak have nowhere to go. Itna dikha diya ki real life me sabke jehen me gus geya aur aajkal rape aise ho rahe hai jaise gilli dannda khel rahe ho, har gali, har mohalla, chauk me rape hi rape aur bas chan hi report ki jati hai.. It&#39;s shameful yet people keep watching such shit to this day
such a pathetic and nasty era of movies, rather calling them movies is an insult to movies itself.
How are these family friendly movies üòê

these scenes make me so mad how could anyone think these were a good idea at any time
Makes me wonder if bhakts grew up watching these movies.
Lately I saw Marathi movie &quot;lappajhappi&quot; and the whole movie is based on voilence and terrifying a pregnant woman which they justify by the issue of female infanticide which also does not make much sense.
Just to give you a bizarre sneak Anmol, there was a Govinda starrer movie, of which I fail to remember the name. A lass is married to Shakti Kapoor, and on their first night, with a lame reason the groom gets exchanged with Kader Khan. And then this bride who happens to have a glimpse of this replaced groom, this is what she says, &#39;Wah. Kya banka chora hai. Aaj toh maja aa jayega&#39;. Now just try and imagine a newlywed bride saying this on her first night

It&#39;s so disgusting that in India &quot;Pyaar&quot; usually translates to &quot;Sex&quot;....and not  <br>&quot;Love&quot; ....like did you even know what sex called in Hindi coz it&#39;s inappropriate according to people and now everyone thinks &quot;Love&quot; means &quot;Sex&quot;....
Glad u md this vdo... It ws really disgusting.. I nvr watched bollywood at tht pnt of time
U wasted one min to get ride into it....
No film is good between 1970 and 2005.<br>Last best movie of 1970s was Pyaasa(1957), and first good movie by 2005 till now is Lagaan.
watched this bewafa sanam today only....actually beared it
I guess your intentions are good but I hope you understand that you are also doing what these sick directors did...perverts must be waiting for these videos to see all the sick scenes at one place. Just a thought
Bollywood was meant to ruin the culture and beautiful traditions of our country. It was funded by the foreign countries to defame our people, society, culture and everything about us. Bollywood never showed the real India it was all a facade.
Plz consider my recommendation and watch the movie once...
U should hv included 1997s loha tooü§Æü§Æü§Æ.. casting Dharmendra,mithun chakrawarti and ramya krishnan...the movie unnecessarily contains so many rape scenes that is unbearable to watch....
Total chutiya video üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª
My soul skipped a beat. How disgusting bollywood can be
Thank God we didn&#39;t watch any of these.
After this video I actually know what is disgusting, before this I always thought it was for entertainment purpose but after this video , I actually know what&#39;s wrong with those vulgar scenes , actually films reflect the society and with these types of films what message they give to public .. Shameful
The moment you see &quot;Gulshan Grover&quot; is playing the cop role. You know he is not going to save her!!! Lmao üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
These movie scenes are way more disturbing. <br><br>And it seems that a rape scene was included in almost every movie in those times
Regressive contents never get dated. Think about the trashy dialogues of houseful 4 released in 2019. Shame on akshay for uttering the nonsense dialogues
Bollywood is shit house.

delhi crime was boring series<br>\

In every old movie it was mandatory to put a rape scene.
U miss one thing in Kaun kare kurbani the mask rapist is producer and director of the movie bastard
50 shades of bollywood
Listen up kid..go and watch movies of today...then come back and analyse....you just being a complete fool trying to judge the 90s movies...I dont subscribe to it but seriously u think u have grown to be more better today?? Is that a joke??
Good voice ...
You have created way too many videos on this topic...this is becoming boring...Pls show something new
The only reason things are a bit better now...is not because Indians have evolved...but because the concept of sensitivity has been easily imported from abroad. Due to Hollywood setting examples in humane topics...we have learnt how a society should behave. Earlier Hollywood movies weren&#39;t so easily accesible. Now they are..

Logical things that are created by bollywood, ignored  by censor board and catches by idiot audience
Vomit
Main Culprits are Story writer, imagine way back in early 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s these types of cheap dialogue how someone could watch along with their families and that to tohfa movie was block buster, and known as family entertainer movie. the lagacy of vulgarity fro dailgues to scene follows till today and current generation people won&#39;t even hasitate to watch along with familes. they say sex education is must .... wah re wah akhand lust to bhara pada hain reel ho ya real physical ho ya practical sabhi ko chahiye ....
Nowadays this is more evident in South Indian movies where the lead actor stalks the girl to such an extent that she has no other option other than falling in love with him. This is just so ridiculous!

These scenes literally make me puke! The minds with rape mentality in our country are definitely inspired by these movies in some way or the other.

Narration is k jo style.....
Your ideas for videos are great. If possible, only if, could you try the same agendas with other language films..... Your channel will grow higher in viewership, diversified marketing.

You can‚Äôt blame the entire era of 90s and 80s. A few films doesn‚Äôt mean all films of that era were bad. ‚ÄúArdha Satya‚Äù, ‚ÄúJaane bhi do yaaro‚Äù, Angoor‚Äù, ‚ÄúAkrosh‚Äù were classics. I have named just a few. You selected third grade movies and are blaming the 80s &amp; 90s, not right. I beg to differ. The best and golden era of Indian music was 80s &amp; 90s apart from 60s. We get good songs here n there now a days. These days there are Very few songs that one can remember for a few months. Just a thought.

Bollywood is the shittiest thing ever!!!
I am utterly in shock and disgust
It&#39;s not bollywood, it&#39;s Hindi Movie Industry and when you see where is the most Hindi Speaking audience you will understand why such perversion exists in Hindi Movies
Gandu bakchodi kitni Kari he
Bollywood is run by people of the north and central India, who have no respect for women and consider them only as sex machines/toys. I studied in Odisha and being from north-east India, where they women are very empowered, I was shocked to see how pervert-minded my  friends from north and central India were during my college years.
WITCH HUNTING WAS A HUGE THING IN EUROPE NOT IN INDIA
THESE ARE ALL BRITISH SCRIPTS NOT INDIAN
Bro this all scripts are not at all indian these scripts were imported from Europe like think for a second a country where women are worshipped and given so much respect why would they produce such films definitely this means British controls our film industry because witch hunting is a British thing not an Indian thing
This scenes influence criminals to do crime
That&#39;s the whole purpose of Bollywood movies. Drive the audience nuts!!! For eg they should label Bollywood horror movies as comedy instead of horror. I used to laugh a lot watching them. Stopped watching all movies of all languages past 25 years. Even now makes no sense.
Lol
I respect your patience immensely for watching these horrible movies for the sake of reviewing<br>You <b>deserve</b> more subscribers

I believe movies during 90s were worst ....

Bollywood show rape seens every 2nd move ... thats discusting .. it incurging rape in socity
Tried and Refused plz check in the movie Kaun Kare Qurbani plz check at the fight sequence where Sonika Gill fights the goons at the beach. One of the extras in the sequence is Ajay Devgan. In jeans and green shirt. This is around the first hour and 5 mins of the film
Pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3tRG7Ungqs&amp;t=401">6:41</a> &amp; watch Shakti kapoor&#39;s left index finger. It&#39;s just not the scenes are regressive, there is lot more malicious intent than that is shown on the screen.
Waisey this is soo correct. Growing up i have only seen rape scenes in indian movies. It was disturbing. And now i can see how it impacts the minds of these rapists.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3tRG7Ungqs&amp;t=149">2:29</a> Which movie? Knife looks like one from Rambo

Why the actor in Bewafa Sanam looks like Vicky Kaushal to me? ü§î
Bollywood certainly shaped the demography of the country with these sort of films. Now, the country is suffering for the psychological imbibition of such perverse thoughts and justification of such vulgar and inhumane acts as depicted in the films of those decades. Point to be noted is that most of the rural India still prefers and watches these 80s and 90s films; infact the regional music industry in the states of Bihar,Haryana,Rajasthan etc, is full of songs with perverse lyrics and dance steps. This needs to be changed to bring radical shift in the way the majority of Indian masses think and behave.
Fuck so it&#39;s true, present time belongs to soggy rice puddings snowflakes........they can get affected easily by anything and top of it they are hypocrite....love to see girls doing belly dancing in shorts yet feels tormented with 90&#39;s fan service.....suck my 90&#39;s dick BITCHESSSSSSS
Are you reading a script ,? And also your Mike need to fix
These scenes were only 3-4 min long, while nowdays we even cant see movies with our parents.
Kabir Singh was a horrible movie. He was at fault and he proceeded to sleep with many women, do drugs, stay horny. Meanwhile she was pregnant and going through all those problems without her family, and the whole movie the only man who touched her was Kabir. So Kabir was a man whore before her, after her... and she was what? The naive innocent girl who didn‚Äôt even touch her husband, was abandoned by her parents and let‚Äôs not forget had the burdens of the problems pregnancy causes such as back pain, swelling, kicking, etc by herself. Honestly I had hoped the baby was her husbands.

Media should create series of interviews interviewing those now calm and composed directors and actors.. And ask them why did they direct the movies in such a way
<b>These movies have shaped the minds of the Indian population you know.. And whatever people watch on the big screen, they consider it to be the correct and righteous thing to do... These movies are the reason why India is facing such a huge problem regarding women&#39;s safety, gender discrimination, misogynistic mindset and all such related issues.</b> <br><b>If good films that created awareness regarding all sorts of social issues would have been made at that time, India&#39;s condition would&#39;ve been much much better at the present time. Because most of India&#39;s population does not have the capacity to think for themselves about what is right and what is the wrong thing to do. Movies almost completely shape the thought process and mindset of people.</b>
Now there are less of such dialogues, more of super-intimate love-making, leaving nothing to imagination..

The last scene of Shakti kapoor is absolutely disgusting, and I wonder whether the writers wrote the scene right after they finished jerking off. Imagine Shardha Kapoor watching this or even being in a scene like this. Honestly, movies of today are much better, even movies such as Drive etc.

WTF is this shit. Old movies, and mentality of those times. Oh and movies are usually the reflection of the society, and you may believe or not but society is more sexist now then it was before.
Now I know why tv and movies were banned in my house while growing up. I remember seeing very very few movies growing up... Bombay, 1942 a love story, Roja, JJWS and then straight to DDLJ, DTPH, HAHK and the realm of the late 90s family dramas. By then we were big enough to understand right from wrong...<br>We were only allowed 30 - 60 min tv time each day, after I was in class 7th.. which included I dream of Jeannie and Bewitched. No regular soap operas or Hindi movies (well some serials were allowed... Like Alif Laila and chandrakanta ü§£).

The problem with tried and refused productions is that you think that you are the most flawless person on earth. Movies are meant for entertainment, the characters are fictitious and they are just acting. Only fools compare acting to real life situations unless and until something is very sensitive. Yiu talk about non-sense in Bollywood, I feel Hollywood is more nonsense. Existence of aliens in itself is a big stupidity. More stupid is that Aliens in Hollywood are always conspiring to destroy the Earth and the most stupid part is that the aliens in Hollywood always land in the US from the space.

I think they were still better than today&#39;s shit.. atleast they portrayed the real psychology of rapists.
Bollywood is SHIT <br><br>Only Science-Fiction Movies Are Best
3rd class estate agents and other slum worms must never crawl into movie or art field.

I don&#39;t hate Shakti Kapoor for the sting operation rather for his ugliest movie choices. P.s- he is having her daughter that time
These kind of movies speaks volumes about the kind of audience which not only found this acceptable but appreciated this so much that they incorporated this in real life. A soul shaking, horrifying crime like this was reduced to gags in these movies always ending with women taking their own life hence establishing this norm in the society that rape victims should not be allowed to live. Even today general public does more damage to the victim than the rapists by making them feel unworthy of living and leading to even more crimes and suicides and these movies have contributed greatly to this kind of mentality.<br>They have taken the concept of Damsel in Distress and Knight in shining armour way too far.

I was watching raja babu when one scene came where the girl was dying of poisoning because she tried to commit suicide probably.

why TOHFA have such dialogues and scenes is because of the director K.RAGHAVENDRA RAO, who is a famous telugu director known for comparing women to fruits and what not everything. his work was celebrated back then and these days it was pure disgusting. being a telugu guy i hate his work (except for 2-3 devotional films recently).
Pretty much 90 percent of the movies had rape scenes. Disgusting
Rape was actually spread by Bollywood it taught if a girl rejects you follow her harass her and the girl agrees and on top of that all old movies has rape scenes

The fact is that no one wants to make films like if audience don&#39;t want to see they are doing film business .it is completely audience choice whether they want to see it or not .the two decades it works perfectly means how people supported this and react to those sense
Make the video which represent modern cinemas sex scene should be avoided at all cost
South movies still shows this shit
I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s your problem here .. are these scenes where the characters whom either talking vulgar or threatening to rape the female character are more dangerous than present movies like hate story, murder, etc etc where rape and murders just doesn&#39;t restrict to talking but actually happens physically .. and were these scenes in your video are more dangerous than any Masti series movie&#39;s or Tusshar Kapoor starrer adult movie&#39;s .. U guys give these movies 100s of crores collection .. where the things you mentioned in this video are in peaks .. and blaming poor old filmmaker who made films where the time was raw and rustic consisting village nativities ..

The 90&#39;s Bollywood was just so perverted that I used to think it was meant for 18+ adult audiences rather than  younger ones. Its like history repeating itself again, whatever the past Bollywood had portrayed about rape and sexual desires is happening in reality at the present.
That era was beyond my head
Yeah but hypocrisy is that we don&#39;t mind watching the &#39;balatkar&#39; scene in 3 idiots though <br>Why? Coz it&#39;s a good movieüòí
wtf??
Bro.. I wonder. How you have to watch all these shitty movies for these scenes. .üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Staple sexual assault scene-What a metaphor bro you absolutely nailed it
Bhai tum Bolte bahut ho...scene dikhao live commentary kyu karte ho bhai
Jitne rape bharat nahi huye , us se jyada bollywood ki movie me huye hai .... Bollywood ki movies ne rape seen dikha dikha kar , rape badhaye hai.  .
Well, the bad and embarassing aspect about Bollywood cinema is that these Gisa Pita sexist, regressive and bizarre scenes were not even recognised as a shame, vulgar and inappropriate to showcased in the theatre or TV, we are never want such scenes in those regressive movies like Bewafa Sanam, Benaam Badsha, Raja Ki Aayegi Baaraat, Tohfa and Kabir Singh, etc.. We were uncomfortable, shocked and cringy to see that on the big screen.
What a surprise. Girls being abused in India.  Is there anything wrong in art imitating life.

Abey saale whatever year it is people are showcasing the same on screen.People need movies like Mardaani 2 which makes society think.I dont partialise with 70s or 80s or whatever but emraan hasmi and all the sex showoff on screen isnt to be celebrated either.
guess what..someone in 2079 would be makimh videos over today&#39;s movies
Utterly disgusting!!!
Were zombies sitting in the so called censor board committee back then??
So bollywood is the main reason of assaulting woman. They always show woman as sex object. Generations to generations. So womans r facing brutal rapes in india. Shame on bollywood

That &quot;Bewafa sanam&quot; scene was Kabir Singh before Kabir Singh.
Wtf last scene hoto ko choosunga yuck and she is happy to get raped wtf!!!!
So it&#39;s being going on from decades..... perverting act in bollywood.
Bollywood is stooping down to new lows every single day! Why only these scenes! Take most of the songs of today&#39;s era...you think they make sense? What do you think of this line from a song means &#39;abhi umar hai karle galti se mistake&#39;? Just an example... Bollywood ghatiya tha, hai aur rahega
plase change intro sound.
You always talk about misguiding the youths of that era and promoting sexism, but what about misleading the society as a whole that raped women have no right to live and accepting death is better than being raped and being raped is a bigger crime than raping someone. (Sorry for any wrong grammatical mistakes, if any)
Tohra hindi me bolte to acha lagta
But why did you choose all funny scenes while portraying misogyny?? Why Anmol why??
wtf bollywood
Do u watch the whole movie, man it would be tiring.
After watching the whole video I need a Crocin
Video ideas for ur channel. Such as most underrated supporting artist...including Ashwini kalsekar, chandan roy sanyal, mukesh tiwari etc.
Tried and refused productions.. You should watch the bengali movie SHABDO ( sound) . Also watch BAISHE SHRABON ( 22nd day of bengali month shrabana).
Bollywood degrading indian society
Such a shit channel <br>Taking old B grade movies and analysing them trhough todays standards . The scene in tohfa was to show what kind of a lowlife he is as sridevi end up marrying him. <br><br>And its thirty, not tharrttthhii
Are bhai bakbak chhodkar zara woh video bhi batadiya kar na.
in this video you have made a point that movies do play a big influence. then why movies like Kabir Singh is excused in the name of creativity. you are good Jammy and I do not mean to pull you down with this statement. but I hope you understand.<br><br>In our country the quality of basic education and institutions is in a very bad shape which makes the masses vulnerable to media influence. until the quality improves it is a responsibility of glamour world to prevent making such scenes. and this change can happen only if the right people are given opportunity to make movies instead of greedy ones.

Suggestion: please don&#39;t talk too much, just go straight to the point.
This is it.. am officially unsubscribing from ur channel.. my ears eyes and brain all bleed simultaneously after watching such videos on ur channels !!!
How about mentioning Kabir Singh. In these cases it&#39;s not the protagonist who is a rapist so they are not some example setting characters. However in Kabir Singh it were the protagonists that were really regressive. <br>Imagine if some goons come and put colors on me in holi, I should just cry to my boyfriend.  I would actually take a hockey stick and beat them up plus complain in the police. <br>If a guy told me he liked the way I breathe I would think he is psychotic.  <br>You know the problem with these kind of movies is very serious.  The Suman of MPK and Preeti of Kabir are the girls Indian guys idolize so what about girls like us, who are aggressive, independent and yet really nice simple women at heart.  Please Kabir Singh and MPK type movies are regressive at every step. Oh those long hair and salwar kameez... And guess what guys if Kabir got a heart attack and died (which he would coz his wife would be unable to take him to a doctor, ) his kids would beg, coz the wife is so lame
Kudos to u, watching these scenes actually gave me a headache, cant imagine u actually watched the complete films to pick these scenes
Hello there, pls do the same for telugu 90&#39;s movie but in telugu to reach more no. Of viewers,  thank you.
I really miss these 90s sensual films.. Wish we can get them back.. Those 90s Indian girls were just on another level...
It‚Äôs cringeworthy! Yukkkkkkkkk!
A scene from masterji starring Rajesh Khanna and sridevi ...<br>Where shakti Kapoor tries to rape her own teacher( i dont know actress name) is also a matlab kuch bhi scene
for all this fucking flim,we are here, assholes rape a woman and they pretend it is not his fault.

The first one is similar to what the director of &#39;Arjun Reddy&#39; believes
No wonder our culture and attitudes have been affected by this regressive attitude of Bollywood. Bollywood glamorized rape and promoted it as sexual activity. The rapists and even our law system treats rapes with this attitude. <br><br>We see the results in our country now. Then Jayaji stands up in parliament calling for lynching of rapists. What a disservice to the nation.
Is that shakti kapoor in bolly-zoro costume?
That last bit from the 1984 film! :) I think I will throw up. Disgusting yikes.
In movie Jalwa (ending sequence)<br>Rishi Kapoor gets hospitalized cz of kidney failure he has daughter Rinki Khanna who says &quot;i am a girl and can&#39;t donate her kidney to his father&quot; and Son says &quot; i want to become famous musician&quot; so can&#39;t donate his kidney to his father. finally salman khan being his son of first wife donates it secretly.<br>Howz that possible own children won&#39;t agree to donate kidney to save their fater?
Mujhe to pata bhe nh h inka naam
Why do you even create these videos? For entertaining your subscribers, particularly those who keep returning to watch such filth ... which they secretly enjoy? You don‚Äôt believe me? Okay then why not make a video on ‚Äòshit‚Äô ... and you will see no one is watching it, cos that is real disgust and not such pretence-disgust! So as I was saying, what purpose are you trying to serve really? I mean if you get your hands on an actual rape video, will you air that too ... just to show how wicked and weird some people can be? Yes those were bad times, but why are you not letting them die ... instead of reviving and highlighting them like this?! You are a talented man, so please do something really creative that will help people get educated &amp; evolve ... instead of wasting your time like this. I am now having a real problem deciding which is more disgusting: These videos ... or the person who brings such filth before us!!
But you guys had problem with kabir singh.
Great moment guys , he mentioned Pulkit Kochar , one of my brother ,‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
I have never imagined that any movie can show like the last conversation between them. I am really shocked.
Tohfa scene was so so shameful. Highest level of cheapness. Actually what we can say about director &amp; dialogue writer?
hit like if u feel ge sounds like Karthik Aryaan‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

ye scenes ni dekh jarahe....film kese logon ne dekhi hogi...totally ridiculous especially last one...
I don‚Äôt remember the name of this movie in which Kiran Kumar rapes a mother who is saving her kid and kills her by hitting a bat on her head. This scene still haunts me till this day. If anyone know the name of the movie
The last one in which Shakti Kapoor is there is explaining rape in such a way ki  vo or kuch ni pyaar krne Ka tarika hai, I mean how ridiculous
And these are the legends of Bollywood now . Still Mausi chii g**nd and awu lolita har reality but not so reality show me aate hai aur muft ki ijjat milti hai in saalo ko . How ridiculous is this , shame on Bollywood and there supporters .
Even If you upload one of these videos every week, you&#39;ll still not run out of content lol
bro make one video about CAB  like dhruv rathee
Jammy ! Aap bahut achche hai ! ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§
It was so embarrassing to sit with parents and watch these 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs movies where a rape scene was a must absolutely disgusting
Even onlydesi sees your videos you should be proud of yourself

W.T.F. man seriously W.T.F.
80s 90s and early 2000s made it worse, that abla nari plot, nothing but soft porn shit and absolutely disgusting treatment of women, no means yes troupe.  And then they say why is the mentality like what it is today. Even today if you watch certain movies you feel like nothing improved. It&#39;s heartbreaking and shitty.
Matlab kuch bhi rocksüòÜüòÜüòÜ

Bro I love your voice
The last scene was beyond ridiculous. I mean I cringed a loy
There are even many films in that era where rape scenes are too common to occur.<br>Every movie there will be a villain who is wealthy or powerful who is a pervert and if the villain is not shown like that he is considered to be a weak villain.
80&#39;s &amp; 90&#39;s movies = Disgust Alert
Disgusting...<br>Nd d last scene was beyond any imagination...<br>ü§®ü§®
I have lost my IQ after watching this 90s shit.
I m pretty sure Shradda Kapoor asked questions to her father how he convinced himself to say those lines being a father of girl.
I feel that movies reflect the society and thus everything we see is just a projection.
Only joker and Harley queen can have sanam bewafa type romanceüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Wonderful content Bro..<br>Hats off to you!
These typical 80s and 90s movies are still bombarded on Hindi movie channels titillating viewers to commit sex offences.
Its nice to see now Bollywood or video content is becoming more sensitive and hopefully we see it&#39;s positive effect in future. <br>if these movies are still being showed on t.v.  channels then they must be banned asap.
Oh my god! This is extremely disgusting! No wonder our Population and it&#39;s thought process is bizzare.
The world always sucked.
You Know These Kinds Of Absurd Movies Are Actually Responsible Of The Rapidly Growing Brutal And Heinous Crimes Against Women In The Country As It Always Teaches To All Men&#39;s Of Our Country That All Women&#39;s Is Nothing But An Property!!!!!!
This slapping scene actually reminds me of Sandeep Bagga&#39;s comment and then i realized nothing has changed.. Just that hypocrisy have increased manifold (hope I am proven wrong)
Who love TRP<br>Like or comment

make a video on films that changed film making with there treatment of subject , actors and now we have reached the stage where content based films are doing better than SRK starrer. <br>munna bhai mbbs, dil chahta hai, rang de basanti, sarforosh, lunch box,  etc.<br>special mention to the directors who were not afraid to experiment. <br>actors like rajkumar rao, ayushman,Irfan, are yesteryear naseeruddin shah

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3tRG7Ungqs&amp;t=136">2:16</a> earliest live action portrayal of Joker and Harley Quinn
<b>There has been a huge debate about weather or not bollywood has played its role in the current rape culture of india and boys disrespecting girls at a large.</b><br><i>Seeing these movies i have no doubt in my mind that our society was way messed up earlier than it is today and bollywood being &quot;A mirror of it&quot;, played its part in depiction of vulgarity and sense of disrespect towards woman no lesser.</i><br>a generation has been brought up with that 90s ideology and YES with those bollywood movies where misogynistic behavior was portrayed as heroic or accepted in one way or the other.<br>No doubt after seeing a bhabhi or aunty figure as a sex partner through directors lenses, a thought process developed in a lot more mass than it would have normally and there are things i can go on and on with.<br>Being a big platform if bollywood wants creative freedom at least it should have moral values in depiction of such scenes. Else this will always be a blame game of &quot;Soft target&quot; vs &quot;Society&quot;.
If you truly love someone , you should be able to slap them - The Great Sandeep Vanga Reddy
And people actually got soo offended with Kabir Singh. Sigh!<br>Imagine if ‚ÄúBorat‚Äù released in 2019..<br>tbh society has became way too sensitive and can get offended with literally anyyything!
The woman that committed suicide while being &quot;tormented so much&quot; by Amrish Puri was wearing white running shoes. Did she know shed have to run a distance before dying? Also, most women n victims in 80s n 90s cinema apparently projectile jumped to their deaths. They often landed 2 to 3 metres away from the house they jumped out of.
Please review south Indian movie 96..its a treat to watch
I always hate that time of Bollywood making such cheap moving only using the same cheap concept.
Ik we have somewhat evolved as cinema but whats ur take on music by composers like yo yo honey singh. We have to start respecting women in our heads.
I think the actresses should refuse to do such roles where women are portrayed as weak,vulnerable and dependent.
My sympathies for all that you go through to research.

I also feel the same as you, but to be fair to the creators of such films, they are portraying a charater who is disgusting itself, and this is what that characters think abt women, and at that time ppl used to really find it weirdly entertaining,  for eg the gulshan grover scene, i guarantee u when the audience wud had seen it in the theatres their wud had been claps and whistles on his entry, so dont judge the creator&#39;s of the movies of that era
Intro short karo bhaiiii
üò•üò± very disturbing

Brother i was searching for long time but couldnt find coz dnt knw de name finally u helped me
The Film Muquadma you mentioned..seems to blatantly copied from the American Thriller Classic  &quot; I Spit On Your Grave&quot; (1978) ...they did shamelessly managed to copy the rape sequence which was unhinged and brutal in the original and had aesthetical symbolism of that era of crime against women in America...but they unquestionablly failed to deliver that message which was in the original...just unfreakinbelivable...

Thank God of is born in 2000 because as an introvert and feminist I would have died because as he said nineties is about these stupid cranky things
Would like to see a matlab kuch bhi episode on how males to were subjected to bull shits scene in Bollywood
The Ape scene has really disturbed me
Bollywood produces shit movies more
I feel disturbed and disgusted at the same time
The biggest menacing villain of Bollywood movies is Gabbar Singh but in sholay he didn&#39;t do this kind of shit these kind of mentality is taken from Telugu Tamil and kannada movies you can watch old Telugu songs in 90&#39;s and 80&#39;s you will find heroines are completely objectified they are hit by fruits on waist and cleveages and those movies were given u certificates if Bollywood was regressive it got that from southern cinema
Sanam bewafa was a cheap type of befikre

people are so snowflakes..u criticize the 10 year old concepts after 10 years they will criticize u because every generation thinks they are better.and the scenes potrayed are not wrong they are just bad acting because such people do exists ..if some good directors like scorsese did that with brilliant actors like nawaz or hardy or pachino audience will see it as a art ..so fucking quit this whining u snowflakes
You miss jitendra movie <br>I don&#39;t the name but he was sharing side by side bed on wedding night next to his brother
They were still good in 1990s. We didn&#39;t have much content in 90s. Also we do have a lot of useless and senseless content in nowadays cinema. Secondly, I would advise you to make a video on <b>Songs of 1990</b> vs *Songs of Present Era*. <br>Everyone wants to know the magical and romantic songs in that era that takes you to another level.

Where were those feminist activists those days,  who were constantly screwing film like Kabir Singh only because it made more financial numbers and was loved by the whole country....

How Do you watch these movies ,it&#39;s torture<br><br>Also after so many me too cases against actors and directors and producers and relating to most of cast in these movies isn&#39;t it obvious that they are depicting there own perversion on screen
Your video is sooooo damn relevant &amp; the scenes purely  disgusting!!!! üò®üò°
Hello Jammy sir, I suggest you to instead watching the same 80s &amp; 90s... you can provide reviews Or just names of some gems created before that in the golden era especially in 1950-1970
You know, I feel that these movies need to get recertified and should be banned from the regular television broadcast! I literally am disgusted and the respect towards such veteran actors is melting down.

The mindset of today&#39;s rural people or semi-urban people even urban aswell  towards women is the result of 90&#39;s Bollywood !!! And it is this generation who has to make all the efforts to change it!!!
Speaking of censor, they can&#39;t even censor the poster film like tusshar kapoor film like kya kool hain hum 3 &amp; so on. I remember when they blur out scene from spectre &amp; now the recent film ford vs ferrari ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è which is ridiculous.

Bro, make a list of &#39;Bollywood movies that went into obscurity for good&#39;
I watched the first movie Bewafa Sanam and didn‚Äôt have a problem with it. It made sense the girl was not in love with him and was deliberately in a relationship to mess with his head. Yes she was throwing away his stuff, but that was because she was a cruel horrible person. He was sticking up for himself and it got out of hand with the violence.
Bewafa Sanam is a Unintentionally funny movie.? Are you Fuckin kidding me ? <br>It&#39;s a really good movie with great performance from the lead actor.
You should stop making these type of videoe because they are just waste of our time and people are able to understand what is good or what is bad so please make recommendations videos because they are worth of our time. And your efforts
Bro your videos are amazing but I think your content is getting very repetitive. Try making videos on totally new topics
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3tRG7Ungqs&amp;t=130">2:10</a> kabir singh 2.0
I am not defending the content that is being discussed in this video.<br>But the content is way back 80s 90s. In those days these were norms of society as a whole. A lot has changed now. We shouldn&#39;t judge what happened in the past based on what is considered bizzare today. It doesn&#39;t make any sense and it isn&#39;t fair. It isn&#39;t logical
Brother have you seen the body?
Its weird that your channel still hasnt reached 1M subscriber... You deserve more buddy... The effort you put in making your videos and the way you review the movies are absolutely flawless and unbiased.. you do deserve more bro...
This is so seriously fucked up
Would you mind reducing the intro?<br>We already read the title and then again we have to watch you explaining the title in detail for 1 minute
I think Censor Board Personnel were Tharkis
Kudosto you for watching these kinda cringey stuff.
Dude do you seriously watch these    movies???
Ok I cringed!
dekho kaisi kaisiii films banta raha hy india... discusting... senseless movies. nothing but sex appeal.
ü§Æü§Æü§Æ this movies are the reason for all sexual assaults that are happening today
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3tRG7Ungqs&amp;t=365">6:05</a> wtf censor boardüòï
How could you watch this kinds of Movies!???
Watch on 1.50x
You know they are playing characters or vilians
Not only scenes but songs also,where stalking and harrassment is glorified as a way of showing love,the trend continues still.
Bollywood always showcase what happens in real life. You say bollywood movies were during 90s  were disrespecting women. So jammy in current 2019 era women in reality are still disrespected hyderabad rape case, Unnao rape case and soon we will movies on these incidents. Then you will start criticising this era too. You happens to be one of the worst critic ever who can&#39;t get over only critising bollywood movies and praising kerala movies.
After seeing your video it is a clear indication why actors like Govinda, Shakti Kapoor and many others from the 90 are not getting consistent work in the industry.
Yar aj kl k mvies me kon sa sharifi dikhata h... Khulam khula randipana dikhata h
How do you even watch such films?????? üò≤üòÆüòØ
In a way you are also doing social service. By showing such nonsense things that has happened in movies. Most importantly by discriminating between good content and absolute trash content which even influence the minds in society. Such irresponsible acts you showed today. Thanks. You are doing great.
I almost died of cringe when she said &quot;Mere aise bhagya kahan?!&quot; I mean wtf???
&quot;Nahi&quot;<br>Haan<br>Nahi<br>Haan<br>Nahi<br>Haaan<br><br>Tf was that movie lol
Wtf. I think the worst conversation scene between any man and woman was tohfa&#39;s scene. Disgusting
Please do a review on the movie &quot;Mudda 370 J&amp;K&quot; which released on 13th of this month!
That was 90s dude. It was whole different world. People were not educated. Noone was saying or doing what the society wants. Everyone was master of her/his own rules. Besides some cons, most of the people were happy unlike today. We can today talk about these things and are living a comfortable life because we have progressed and to progress first step is to start and someone had to start from somewhere and i think the 90s people have done a great job in doing that.
Inn saare bollywood movies ki wajah se aaj india most dangerous country for women bann gya hai.üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè

I‚Äôve never been this early in your channel and I finally have been early!!!!
Matlab kuch bhi........
Man the last part wanted to slap dialogue writer
I was born in early 80s. So these movies were part of my movie diet unfortunately. And to be honest, as a kid I saw nothing wrong with such content cause all movies had it. So it had to be right.<br>In fact a woman killing herself to save herself from rape, or because she had been raped seemed like the absolute right thing to do! I remember praying that I never get raped cause then I would have to kill myself. Yes it was that bad!<br>Am glad that after growing up, I got a different perspective about consent of a woman. <br>But given that I was so badly brainwashed, I am thinking what of the rest of my generation? How many of them gained a different perspective? <br>My mom still thinks that a girl is jn some measure responsible for sexual assualt if she is wearing revealing clothes (facepalm). Yes, thats how bad it was. :-(
Now this concept has shifted to heroes and we can see the latest example of this in Kabir Singh.And guess what it is a hit.
<b>Matlab kuch bhi</b> yes, this was the 90s... b &amp; c grade films.
You know whats actually frightening,all these movies are easily available to fuel the desires of pervated illiterate shitheads
Pls give a review on 96 movie starting vijay sethupathy
This is sick. But this was so common in the movies back then also because audience enjoyed such cringeworthy  scenes
The moment you see gulshan grover.<br>So true
Hahahahaha ma tou tumhy check kar raha tha üòÇ
What is special now in bollywood movies they were garbage before and garbage and copy now nothing changed
Starting to get depressed watching all this,the newspapers are full of it,the movies are full of it..real life to a lesser degree..whenever you get time ,make a &quot;hope is still alive&quot; list..
it used to be funny but not anymore, i dont really know why.
Bhai I have to say this : I have never seen these films.<br>Utterly disgusting

Hi
Lol only u watch these movies..  u have so much time
This Is An Exact Reason Of Why I Truly Hate 80s And 90s Which Is Considered As Wild Wild West Because Women Always Being Presented As Damsel In Distress With Such Low IQ&#39;s &amp; Men Always Been Shown As Sex Addicts With Typical Male Ego Mindset &amp; Worst Part Is That These Films Always Showcases Rape As Normal Act &amp; That Too In An Explained Manner!!!
At least they are far better than today&#39;s stupid Cinema...
I could tell at least 50 from saaho itself. The entire movie was bizarre. Gaya mera paisaüò•
How&#39;s that 3 idiots scene funny then it is equally disgusting
I wonder how do they make , act and release such scenes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3tRG7Ungqs&amp;t=126">2:06</a> and people think joker is pshyco
Jammy plz do watch tamil movie Kaithee. I really enjoyed watching it. I just wanna know whether its a  worthy movie  apart from my personal affinity.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mkb">#MKB</a> rocks
Bollywood malign image of males
Make a video on top 10 movies of the decade.
If it&#39;s not sexist or creepy, it&#39;s not Bollywood masala.
Jammy Bhai pls make a video on statements made by Anthony Mackie on &quot;why hollywood movies suck now&quot;<br><br><br>One of those statements was &quot;Today movies are made for 16y/o and China&quot;
I am sorry to say, I love your videos but this was a bit hard to watchüò•. It&#39;s not your fault though. It was because of the content.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3tRG7Ungqs&amp;t=275">4:35</a> damn that bikini even today&#39;s actress will hesitate to wear such bikini &amp; i&#39;m surprised that censor board of that time allowed such scenes &amp; movies.
Moral:these 90s film leaded  2019 youth minds towards a rape mentality
and ppl wonder why rapes are happening
Shocking very shocking the last part.

Bro, do Mohabattein Holi song lyrics review. Its utterly disgusting and sexist.
Even today, Bollywood is still sexist and objectifies women through so-called Item numbers, which are meant to attract male audience and thus mint more money at box office.

That bewafa sanam guy looks like sasta vicky kaushal
Bollywood is seriously messed up
All these clips do is boil my blood and get me disappointed
Bro what‚Äôs your opinion on movie Laila majnu
Amaaaaaaaaazing
now it‚Äôs shifted from movies to real life. and in a much much worse way.
Most disappointing aspect is that these Regressive scenes nd dialogues were not even recognised as vulgar nd inappropriate to be showcased in big screen
Here is my suggestion for your next video:- <br><br>Best ever Protagonist-Antagonists pair in Bollywood or Indian Cinema or maybe Top 5/7. For example:- <br><br>‚Ä¢ Bahubali-Bhallaladeva (my favourite) <br>‚Ä¢ Vikram-Vedha <br>Etc....
It&#39;s kind of so disturbing to even watch. :(
You really watch these films .... salute !!!
Love your content as always! Just curious to know whether would you reviews International movies as well in the future?? <br><br>Of course, only famous ones!! Not all!!
