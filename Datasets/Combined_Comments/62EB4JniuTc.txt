I remember when I was only excited for Falcon and the winter solider and I remember saying how will a Loki project work… until then we had Peak that we did not see coming
Loki is the best series
Bro I miss these days with these 3 shows, the nostalgia. I do feel old now
When marvel was cinema
I MISS THESE DAYS
Loki  said  he will burn this place to the ground but he never did lol
Loki burning the place down ⚡👊🏼
Back when we were so hyped for disney olus shows
So hype
We’re old
All the comments all the hype for the mcu coming back after endgame and nearly everything since has been a dud
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=26">0:26</a> Loki was right 😂😂😂 Its burnt to ground now 😢
Like it 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Can&#39;t believe this was 3 years ago

Woah! Watching back on this now still gives me goosebumps! Hahah

It had so much potential and they turned Mcu into Dceu (absolute Doggshit)

this is still such an epic teaser
Loki just has 3 sec, but he killed it!<br><br>WandaVision still blows me away, even after two years.
well yea the universe is expanding and it gonna be awsome and so all those shows have been moved in 2021 and 2022 but it was so awsome.
Thank you marvel and Disney+ for this amazing shows !! We loved all of them ❤️❤️
still such a good trailer
I’m excited for Loki Season 2
Anyone back here after we&#39;ve seen it all?
Who is here after MoM?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=24">0:24</a>
you have no idea how long I&#39;ve been searching this teaser for WV with the &quot;Vision residents&quot; line.....
I remember when this trailer just came out, I feel like WandaVision is really weird and I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT. And here we are after MoM dropped. What an experience.
I want to feel this vibe like the first time againn 😩
This trailer is better than some of the shows tbh
Can’t believe this was 2 years ago. I remember feeling so hyped.
anyone else here while moon knight is going on✋
What an experience
Wanda Welcome Home <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=12">0:12</a>
Rewatching it in 2022 and i just realized the aspect ratio shown for Falcon and the Winter Soldier and WandaVision are different
Looking back on this big game spot in 2022. Congratulations to Marvel Studios for executing these series and more on Disney +. Phase 4 is off  to an amazing start!!!!
Music?
I also came back to get chills 🔥
I just came back here to get some chills
Does anyone have the sound ??
Loki had such a badass line.
They should have done a trailer like this when they announced the Netflix shows are going to disney+
I miss the time when this trailer first came out :( the hype was real
I remember this
Well isn’t 2020 a goddamn lie 😑😑😑
No one expected Wandavision to be so important for Multiverse of Madness<br>I kept telling everyone they should watch it<br>Some did not but not us
Es hora
That was 2 years ago??? That&#39;s crazy!
I can&#39;t believe this is two years old already!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
This was the moment when nobody&#39;s getting that much hyped for WandaVision. And now...
Come on Marvel give us a 2022 version for Moon Knight, She-Hulk and Ms Marvel 🔥
I hope they have a regular full spot for Doctor Strange MOM and they have another in this type of mix-up format for the Disney+ shows coming this year (MoonKnight, She/Hulk, Ms Marvel and Secret Invasion)
Whats the name of the song tho
It’s crazy how COVID messed everything up. All these shows were supposed to come out 2020
ngl marvel needs to drop another trailer like this one
2022 is gonna be even crazier!!!
i keep coming back to this
Can I Get Up Now
A look back at all of these, cool as hell.
A Marvel é incrivelmente incrível...
I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve all already seen these shows.
Who&#39;s here after watching no way home. What a year for marvel and their fans. Thanks goodness ❤️
It’s crazy how it’s already been a year....
I’m so glad these shows came out this yesr
This is just so good
Loki can take my heart with just 5 seconds of talking
Loki Best ❤️
what a ride it was
This was seriously over a year ago!?
Don&#39;t mind me. Just came here after today&#39;s Disney+ day for Moon Knight, She-Hulk, Miss Marvel, What If?, Loki, Secret Invasion and more. Man the marvel universe really is expanding.
Still goosebumps.
Honestly, I&#39;ve seen all these shows so many times now, but watching this, remembering the overanalysing of every last bit of it was so fun
Big game? <br><br>nah.<br><br><br>BIG SHOT &gt;:)
hopin we get another one of these for disney plus day this year with Ms Marvel, Moon Knight and She Hulk
The music.
At home releases should be released in this aspect ratio. I don&#39;t understand the point of cropping it down to 21:9. Forget your story reasons. Show me the whole image. Why are you withholding screen information I know you have. If you wont do it for the movies, then dont do it for the TV shows. Except WandaVision. Alright, your story reasons are validated when it&#39;s presented in that style. Otherwise STOP CROPPING THE FRAME
It&#39;s crazy how it&#39;s already a year, and all of these shows are all out😭
the mandalorian season 1: <b>ends</b><br><br>other people: <b>unsubscribe disney+</b><br><br>me: <b>CONTINUE WATCHED TFATWS</b>
Who&#39;s here after Venom: Let There Be Carnage new trailer?
WandaVision, The Falcon And The Winter Soldier and Loki are some of the best content the MCU has put out.
“The Universe is Expanding”<br><br>Same tag line uses in the venom trailer right before Cledus kills a spider ....
So who is here after Wandavision, Falcon &amp; winter soldier and Loki
I remember watching the super bowl with my friends and we were all blasted so when this came on Ong we were all screaming
Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s already over, Hawkeye we&#39;re ready for you now!
Am I the only one or does anyone else still gets goosebumps seeing this?
Oh sh there more I thought Loki flacon and the winter solider and Wanda vision there more dr strange and spider man and much more
In 2021<br>1. Falcon and the winter soldier 👏 amazing <br>2. Wanda vision nice 👌 <br>3. Loki that&#39;s amazing super 👌 😍 ❤ <br>4. Sang - chi brilliant 👏 new super hero amazing superb mast<br>5. Venom let there be carnage going to be a big fight 👏 🙀 <br>6. Eternels please do in hindi <br>Marvel - India hai chalta hai<br>7. Spider man no way home That&#39;s gazab fire 🔥🔥.
God dam it I don’t have Disney plus
Song?
I am the 11,111th Comment on this video.
I’d argue some of the best ships are in those three shoes
Thanks for recommending me this 1 year later youtube.
Why is being recommended after a year?😂

Anyone else here after all three of these shows have ended?
Hi

That scene of Loki is nowhere in the T.V. show. Why did Disney/Marvel lie?
Me here after all the shows released remembering how happy I was when this released
Annnnd they&#39;re all finished. Feels like yesterday this came out.
Who else is here after completing WandaVision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki??
Wanda vision show disappointment show the falcon and the winter soldier is a good show Loki is the best show mind blowing master piece review from future

remembering 2019 when this played during the Superbowl and blew my cousin&#39;s brain.
Now this gives me so much nostalgia
Someone here after watching all three?👀
Time flies lol
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate these shows now they are all out!
Loki ended and the only thing we had was a scene that never existed (but he said the line)
Here after finishing Loki season 1. All three of these were entertaining. Some may not share my opinion, but I thought all three shows were good for different reasons.
Welcome to the Multiversal war..💯 <br>Glorious purpose..🙂
looking back, our expectations for these shows were too high because of Endgame but there were enjoyable moments
Nice to see almost all these shows wrap up nicely after so long  (any Loki enjoyers?)
Here after all 3 shows finished. They were amazing!! Just like this trailer
Just came back after watching all three, GOOSEBUMPS!!!
Who is here after the season finale of Loki? It&#39;s incredible that we already have all these series 😁
watching this again after the finale of LOKI hits different :3
I&#39;m so satisfied after watching all of these series...
After finishing LOKI ?
Random kid in 2050:<br>This thing sucks
Funny how this TV Spot has only one scene from Loki and now all these series have ended and Loki has been renewed for another season. Crazy how time flies.
Who is here after all the shows are fully out?
All three shows are now finished, and after Loki, I think it’s safe to say that the title needs to change. <br><br><b>The multiverse is expanding.</b>
And now I have completed all three of these series
Finally after watching these three i must say i am gonna miss them.
1 year ago: This will never happen<br>Today: Finished all 3!!!
And now all of the 3 ended. Time really flies
Loki Episode 6 Spoiler <br><br><br><br><br>Kang the Conqurer🤯🤯🤯
crazy seeing this after all the shows are done. wandavision- 8/10     tfatws- 8/10  Loki- 9/10
that was a fun ride for about 6 months.<br>Falcon &gt; Loki &gt; WandaVision
Excellent💯👍👏
The trilogy ends today with loki episode 6.
And that concludes all three tv shows of the MCU’s Phase 4, can’t wait for more in the future.
Give us loki season 2 sneak peek 🤣
Who is here after loki finale?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=23">0:23</a> Gotcha Loki Stans
I am gonna miss this three!!! It was a great day.
I realize that this clip of Loki in the trailer is not actually in the series.
My fvrt loki ❤️
This place to the ground ,is it finale of loki
Kinda weird looking back at this now lol
Don’t mind me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=24">0:24</a>
This trailer showed Loki 17 months before it came out
Am I missing something from the Loki clip is it not in the series or was it a way to let fans know the tva was gonna show up in it?
loki so hot
Omg... I&#39;m starting to believe the Loki scene in this trailer will be the end of the serie.
Why did I get recommended this over a year later 😭😭
Who is here after loki serious out?
this whole trailer makes so much more sense now that those shows are out!💚
I miss this era of uncertainty what would come
Two series completed one to go
Please release DAREDEVIL S4 too😭

Thank you for recommending this...now?? Literally right as their 3rd show, Loki, is ending?
Can&#39;t believe this was a year ago, and now we&#39;re about to watch ep.5 of loki
Im waiting for loki 5th episode 7th of July 💚
Bakit disney philippines is one of the best fans of marvel bat walang Disney plus😭😭😭😭😭😭
It would be interestiny to get a deep dive into how to be a superhero. Acting. debates. Swim. Strips. How to be perfect behind the scenes

Who’s here after watching all three shows?? (Loki isn’t done quite yet but almost!)
I came here after today&#39;s episode 4 of Loki<br>This is crazy 😂
it took them a year and a half to release all these shows
Daredevil BEST
can&#39;t believe this teaser was released 1 year and a half ago
This trailer was hype hype
Loki é uma série simplesmente fantástica 🇧🇷🇧🇷
And we are now on loki series..
It’s 2021 they’re all out now on Disney+
Who is here after Wandavision , Falcon and the winter Soldier and loki release
Can&#39;t believe this is 1 yr ago
Damm me after finishing wandavision falcon and the winter soldier and half way through Loki
Retrospectively, all these shows keep blowing my mind. I can’t believe the quality being put forth by Marvel on Disney+
It only took one year for us to see all of these shows
Remember when we first saw this? Marvel did not disappoint at all!
This gave me chills...in a good way<br>And wandavision is the best!<br>&quot;Vision residence!&quot;
Turning here when you have watch all the series (Loki actually) and all theses sequences make sense !
Who is watching when loki is out
Who is here after the release of the 2nd episode of Loki
Here for LOKI ✨
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Me encantó muy buena actuación de todos  esos personajes
Anyone here like me after FATWS and preparing the whole-new Loki Series?
3 seconds of Loki: *exists *<br>New Rockstars: let me make a 9 min video about that
This is honestly one of marvels best trailers by far. The editing and sounds are just so satisfying <br>ooft
LOKI ARRIVES IN A FEW HOURS !!!! SO EXCITED !!!!
Bu nasıl bi video ya ,hala etkisinden çıkamıyorun
only OG remember   this from day 1
Falcon and winter soldier - I&#39;m 4 episodes in out of 6, Falcon still doesn&#39;t have the shield... And this trailer came out a year ago. How long did this series take to make anyway?
That line at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=25">0:25</a> makes me smile every time I hear it. I don&#39;t know why.
im finally understand the trailer
Who would&#39;ve thought that these three series will kick off Phase 4

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=21">0:21</a> I know you guys won’t believe me but as soon as I saw this clip I knew that this wasn’t Steve but a new replacement Captain America.
&quot;exclusively on dinsey plus&quot;<br>Me whos watching it on goojara for free and on very exact dates
Marvel should kept this &#39;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=11">0:11</a>&#39; scene away from spot.
I thought Wandavision was about Wanda and vision having a happy life together boy was I wrong  :(
This was released 1 Year Ago <br>Wow , time really flys .
Who&#39;s after FALCON AND WINTER SOLDIER ?
In TFATWS at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=6">0:06</a> when he throws the shield at the tree it is empty, but in the show it is the punching bags cgied on the tree
C&#39;m on what did you expect ,of course I&#39;ll watch this trailer after watching WandaVision and Falcon&amp;TheWinterSoldier
Falcon&#39;s training montage was the best part of the episode.
The nostalgia looking back to that moment in early February 2020.<br>Not because it was pre-pandemic, but because we knew so little and had like 8 seconds of material per show
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=14">00:14</a>
black wido game
dang, time flies...
Epic
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=10">0:10</a> is gonna come in next episode. Calling it now

Who&#39;s here after Wandavision finale
Hey guys! Well, we&#39;re still alive even learning how to live through a pandemic and Disney+ finally arrived (back in Dec in Brazil) and the Marvel Studios series are amazing! WandaVision just finished and they have a lot more to deliver yet.<br>So be safe out there hoping that one day we will go back to theaters watch more Marvel movies!
Who&#39;s here after falcon and the winter soldier released!!
So even after an year this Tv Spot is lit............Falcon and the Winter Soildier comes out tomorrow
DISNEY FDP, TE AMO CARALHOOOOOOOOOO!

This trailer gives me goosebumps even a year later.

Wandavision WAS INCREDIBLY AMAZING.
Do you guys know which soundtrack is this?

Anyone else here after the Wandavision finale?

That scene at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=18">0:18</a> was the <b>the scene</b> I&#39;ve been waiting for and I was not disappointed. Very clever of them removing the vfx (and changing the tv screen) because it really set the stage for this being some sort of some mysterious &quot;alternate reality&quot; in modern times (with her being in colour/in her modern clothes and vision in b&amp;w), yet it didn&#39;t really spoil anything.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=17">0:17</a> Wanda creating Vision 1 year ago
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=11">0:11</a> ❤️❤️❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=18">0:18</a> they hide the main reveal of the  series in plain sight that too in the very first scene they released for wandavision. CLEAVER!
Where&#39;s daredevil
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=18">00:18</a> finalmente essa parte faz sentido
Song name xd
This already feels like five years ago.
Wandavision part of the trailer hits different now.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=18">0:18</a>  wow that&#39;s how it looks without the hex effects
They literally spoiled ep 8 here
Really interesting WandaVision scenes... one in particular...
Like Infinity War, they use the biggest spoiler as clips in the trailer with no context and no CGI. They&#39;re so good at deception in trailers, it&#39;s awesome.
I kept wondering throughout the season what the WandaVision clips was all about and when we’d see it and now, I’m completely satisfied
Anyone from Wanda vision S01 Ep 08?
It Was Agatha All Along! 🎶🎶🎶
i cant believe this trailer dropped a year ago
When you realize that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=12">0:12</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=14">0:14</a> is a scene from the second to last episode! SPOILERS!!!
This Scene was in today&#39;s episode [Ep.08] where Wanda recreated vision <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=18">0:18</a> and I cant believe that no one talked about it before.
Love how they use the climax of wandavision here without the full visual effects.. They&#39;ve really upped their game in trailer deceptions.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=18">0:18</a> We now know the context!
Okay I need this audio but as a 3 minute version and an accompanying album of badass trailer music.
Anyone else here after the 9th WandaVision episode?<br><br>Edit: Thank you for the 1 like person of the intenret
That &quot;Wanda&quot; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=10">0:10</a> is so touching now, man. Poor Wanda
The Scarlet Witch!!!
Here after WandaVision episode 8
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=18">0:18</a> finally got this in wandavision
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=18">0:18</a> i’m waiting for this moment
when watching the Wanda vision scenes in this trailer when it first came out  I was really confused and now episode 7 came out a couple days ago and it’s all coming together
“WandaVision will be the show that kills Marvel” 🤡...like Selena Gomez say...will LOOK AT HER NOW.! This show is straight up pippin’ 😂😂😂🔥
This legit said “The universe is expanding” So it’s either multiverse or just new and more characters coming to this franchise
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=18">0:18</a> WE STILL HAVENT SEEN THIS PART IN WANDAVISION
no manches aparese quiqusilver de evan peters
Wandavision🐐🐐🐐
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=18">0:18</a> when does this happen? episode 7? episode 8?
Loki has two moods.<br>Stealing the tesseract.<br>Or just dying and coming back.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=19">00:19</a>
I remember rewatching this to know what&#39;s actually going on in those shows but now we&#39;re at last 3 episodes of WandaVision and next month we&#39;re gotta get FATWS wahuu!!

Yes... one year has passed. A lot has happened in that year.
Who else is here after the official trailer of The Falcon and The Winter Soldier?

Here after Wandavision has aired 5 episodes and they released a full trailer for Falcon and the Winter Soldier on the next Superbowl
You can’t tell me this is a coincidence considering the Super Bowl is hours away!
I&#39;m here just for Loki 😍
This came up on the same day as NFL? Looks like we’re getting more trailers tonight!
Funny how they could just re-use this trailer and it would still be relevant
1 year ago
A year later and every show except for WandaVision is about to have 2 SuperBowl Trailers 💀
Who else got recommended this in the date of Super Bowl 2021?
Its been one year since this video upload.. Jezz i thought i was like just like 5 months.
Let’s hope we get something like this again today

One Year
Pensar q agora já tô podendo ver wandavision...já tô ficando velha, isso saiu a 1 ano atrás

&quot;She recast piatro?&quot;
Who is here after Quicksilver appearence on chapter 5 of WandaVision?
That was a year ago 😳
We made it!
I wonder what the Marvel trailer for this year&#39;s Super Bowl will include. Stuff for Falcon and Winter Soldier, Black Widow and Loki for sure but what if they include tiny teases of Shang-Chi and Eternals in there? (We&#39;ll have to see on Sunday)
ME: doesn&#39;t anyone know how to be original. Every comment uses the same played was format. <br>ME AGAIN IN CASE YOU FORGOT: now I forgot writing in this stupid way
1 year ago
Weird to think this was a year ago
Who has watched 4 episodes of Wanda Vision

Dang almost a year old and we got one of them
It took them a little over 11 months just to put one of these shows up
Its crazy how this is almost a year old and almost none of these have been released except 2 episodes of Wandavision
It took just under a year for this lol. Also did the Wanda welcome hope happen or do you think we’ll see that later?

Only Marvel can increase the hype in just 30 seconds.
By seeing Audience reaction on Wandavision.   I&#39;m waiting disasters on Loki series.
Alot of people don&#39;t know that this trailer exist
Loki made full teaser awesome
If u could notice...the man whom bucky was threatening was Helmut Zemo...That means he either escaped from the jail and continues his quest to destroy the remaining avengers...or he was released and continues it
Tfw Falcon and the Winter Soldier should’ve been out already 🤧
who are watching this video again and again only for loki&#39;s clip?
I LOVE HOW THE BULLETS COME OUT OF HIS HAND AND WITH THE SOUND

Ok so now just seeing the WandaVision trailer, I’m hoping that Falcon and Winter Soldier has The Boys vibes to it, WandaVision continues with what they’re doing, and Loki has vibes of Umbrella Academy
Im here aftr the WandaVision trailer
로키대사하나만으로 구독확정...

I&#39;m so scared that I won&#39;t get wandavision
They said coming soon 7 months ago
7 months later finally got another trailer for one of them
Just 5 seconds of Loki????? Aaaaaaaa Marvel, you wanna kill me???
I&#39;m Still Crossing My Fingers for Falcon and Winter Soldier, IT BETTER COME OUT IN 2020, If Delayed to 2021 then Have It in either Jan or March or April 2021!!!
I&#39;m here after WandaVision Trailer😁😁
Here after the wandavision trailer drop
Who is here after seeing the new wanda vision trailer? Who is also here when this video popped up in your recommendations when you were watching the new trailer. <br><br>This is going to be exciting and confusing 😂😀😇
Hopefully we see Magneto in WandaVision
WandaVision is my favourite😍😘
Man my boy is the lord of mischief 👹
Don&#39;t know why but i am excited for Falcon and winter Soldier
Loki&#39;s character is the best
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=10">0:10</a> I hear badass sound
Man, the Dr. Smith story from Wandavision is crazy good.
There’s only 4 months left of this year when’s the first going to come out
I need a Sam Wilson Captain America movie so bad 👍👍👍
What about Daredevil, Defenders and others that got cancelled on Netflix, please reboot those too, we need those back!!

Is this on Disney + or Disney + vip
In theory about Loki comebackIf someone thought about the movie (Thor: The Dark World) that Loki pretended he was dead, but they dressed up for the movie (Avengers: Infinity War), then we could say that he pretended to be dead and escaped the explosion like what happened with ThorHe ransomed the theory that he still lives
If the avengers was on endgame but Marvel will rock their fans .<br>Example is this video .
WANDA VISION COMING THIS YEAR!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭
Marvel better give Loki the attention he needs<br>Like..5 seconds is all he got in this tv spot?
Yo repitiendo la parte de Loki parte: 182828288282
tbh i think there ruining marvel doing all these wee shows
This 30 seconds video I watched it about total of 30 hours
When Falcon is flying, he has his suit from the comics
Anyone else just here for wandavision actually coming in 2020
Fun fact they are reshooting most of the first season of falcon and the winter soldier because the main plot had to do with a virus outbreak. Thats why it hasn&#39;t been released.
7 month old trailer, still no confirmation on the tv shows, Black Widow still taking forever to release, the whole mcu being delayed.
I&#39;m still waiting.
someone: how many times are you gonna watch this<br><br>me: i can do this all day
Sure feels like a long &quot;soon&quot;
Loki is awesome
who else got goosebumps?
Journalism: &quot;you need atleast 8 seconds to get your message effectively out&quot;<br><br>Loki: <b><i>best I can do is 3</i></b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=11">0:11</a> is that the villain from civil war?

Loki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Goosebumps ❤️
We did not get any updates like Dc FANDOME ....so like this hype we want in corona holidays <br>Like me who all wants hit like
That Loki is clearly 2012 Loki cuz he was a good guy until he got ganondorf side-b by thanos and died. Can’t wait for the Loki one specifically
It&#39;s 7 month since upload now release ASAP
Ooohhhh boy looks like we hit the motherload
Welp, still nothing lol
I&#39;m watching this video every day until the series finally come out
Did anyone else notice that Loki was wearing a shirt belonging to the Time Variation Authority? There is a possibility that Kang the conqueror might be one of our next avengers villains folks 👀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=23">0:23</a> oh my god- it&#39;s wiccan and speed!
Keep this in mind. WandaVision could be a potential on House of M

I also don&#39;t know how many times I have watched this 😂😂
You&#39;re not a true fan if you&#39;re confused by this. Sorry.
Can&#39;t wait, of course if they&#39;re actually gonna be released

What the hex going on with the WandaVision show it’s so weird because one scene it’s all black and white, the next scene she’s wearing a comic-accurate outfit, and the next is that Vision’s alive some how? Now I want to see the show now.
Speed and Wiccan.<br>That&#39;s my only takeaway.
Just here to remind everybody that the budget for each show is just under 100 million! So expect 8-10 episodes of a full blown marvel movie! Also, if it wasn&#39;t for covid, we would already have Falcon and Winter Soldier smh!!
I guess I  am the only one who watches this 30 seconds video everyday
I am most excited for Falcon and winter soldier .... And of course Loki
Dc gave me a 2 minute trailer for a movie a year away marvel gave me a 30 second teaser in the last 6 months dc knows how to keep us entertained specially when we’re bored during these times I’m kinda pissed
Kuch karo re... comics ke alava
When it&#39;s gonna release?
Loki&#39;s still alive?
This hits different after Corona
just a line from loki was enough
I am here only for 3 seconds of Loki
Is anyone here after the DC fandom
Wanda vision give me an I Love Lucy vide
Lokiii🤗
Hopefully Disney+ comes to my country by the time these shows arrive
Waiting for Loki 💖💖
🔥🔥🔥
Ух-ты!

The 3.5K dislikes is from Thanos and his lackeys.
Can you please anounce its releasing date?
LOKI enjoys all day chilling
WELCOME TO LEVEL 7!
Why do I have the feeling that WandaVision it’s gona be super cute and funny but the ending it’s gona be mind blowing and depressing and we will not not what happened until Dr Strange 2??
YouTube : how many times are u going to watch this.          Me: I can do this day
I heard disney+ will probably bring back the gifted I REALLY HOPE THEY DO, IM FREAKING OBSESSED WITH IT!!😃🦶👉
Marvel: Guess we are with Disney+<br>A app called “Hotstar”: Oh I Don’t think so But we do take money
Loki steals the entire promo with that one line, he is just the best.
😍😍😍awesome❤❤❤👍👍👍
Hawkeye: Am I a joke to you?
I&#39;m going to need to see Falcon and Winter Soldier as soon as possible.
And it still hasn&#39;t come
when r we gonna get these shows?
Still waiting

Loki is just being Loki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I LOVE IT! 💚
🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
I&#39;m back watching this several months later because I&#39;m so desperate for Marvel content 😂😭
Has anyone ever thought of the possibility, that not only are one of the shows called “WandaVision” cause it’s about Wanda and Vision, but because Wanda says “Vision residence” meaning that Vision is her last name? Making her full name “Wanda Vision”
RELEASE THE FULL TRAILER FOR THE FALCON AND THE WINTER SOLDIER AND WANDAVISION
Are these all tv shows or is falcon and the winter soldier a movie
Swagness levels:<br>Level 1 : Marvel Studios turning from red to blue<br>Level 2: Bullets falling in front of Zemo<br>Level 3: Scarlet Witch Comic version costume<br>Level 4: Loki!
Loki: I am inevitable
the dislikes are from thanos and his followers
I need them right now
I&#39;m gonna watch this everyday until marvel drops a new trailer. LOL
Remember when this aired in February and everyone went nuts looking forward to it. Then 2020 and COVID 19 had to come and kerb stomp the world. Sigh.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=7">0:07</a><br><br>Is when It gets good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=24">0:24</a>
I&#39;ve watched this so many times and I never get bored. I keep coming back because I crave more marvel, it&#39;s been too long.
Loki
What&#39;s the name of this cool music ? Plss
Daredevil
Loki!!!!!
I came here after supersuper😊
The Universe is expanding.<br><br>When will it end?!
And &#39;Coming Soon&#39; now has a bit of a different meaning.
I think WANDA VISION is a prequel to AVENGERS INFINITY WAR because Vision dies in INFINITY WAR Vision&#39;s Death shocked me in the movie theatre because he was nice and kind and then Thanoes kills him (curse you Thanoes) and also Lighting McQueen is my favorite Disney/PIXAR character) I give CARS 1 and 3 a A+ and CARS 2 the worst PIXAR movie gets a F- needs to make a LIGHTING MCQUEEN orgin story movie titted (DISNEY..PIXAR&#39;S MCQUEEN) it Will be about LIGHTING MCQUEEN and how he became a race car, also a CRUZ EMEREZ TV SERIES on DISNEY Plus, and a CARS 4 also CARS and CARS 3 are amazing I do not like the 2nd movie it should have been rated PG because it has violences, deaths, action sequences, Gun shooting, and Explosions (CARS has positive reviews of 75% on rotten tomatoes and also CARS 3 also LIGHTING MCQUEEN should become a AVENGER his supername is SPEED LIGHTING I created another superhero named (Spider Vision) it is Vision with a Spider suit and he has the ability to shoot webs out of his way head and he can fly also
I wonder if the Loki clip was filmed a week before the spot aired, just so that they could make footage for the Loki show.
Wow after watching mandalorian i can tell these series are gonna be as great as mando too!(or greater!)
But when?
The universe is expanding: shows this<br><br>But I still miss home: avengers tower
When is it releasing?
i like this one👍👍
Loki in a prison? Or asylum?
Disney: ayo marvel hit me up<br>Marvel: sure why not
After Wandavision you can have Dr. Strange 2 - Multiverse of Madness, then Realities will go crazy, then the powers of the Scarlet Witch will be cool, not only being a &quot;Jean Gray fake&quot; and Dr. Strange not being an Iron Man mystic.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EB4JniuTc&amp;t=10">0:10</a> Zemo??
Tell me how I only want to watch the Loki show right now
Nice video marvel
It&#39;s funny how Falcon and Winter Soldier had more screen time at this teaser, looked more serious and interesting, and people only talk about Loki and Wanda. <b>WTF</b>
Super bowl : you&#39;ve got 30 seconds<br>Marvel : and that&#39;s enough
Wanda is going crazy and Dr. Strange is the one who has to fix it.
OMAIGAAAAAAAAD
Should&#39;ve got a trailer by now😒
Anybody know the song used??
I am just here for loki &lt;3
When when I gotta know now 😨😲
Still can&#39;t get over the fact that Steve chose Sam as the next Cap instead of Bucky.
Marvel:This universe is expanding<br>Me:Then where&#39;s my mutants are
Me: I can do this all day.
Me after watching this.<br><b>RIP NETFLIX!</b>
Why is Elizabeth Olsen such a babe?
I think I’m most excited for Wanda vision

Looks like WandaVision may be the only Marvel Studios MCU show to hit Disney Plus this year.
When will it releases in Disney hotstar bro
Every: Comment.<br>Looks: Like this.
I just hope disney won&#39;t turn the marvel movies into some kind of fairy tales kind of stuff.But you know what Loki&#39;s appearance in here is a total badass.
Vision and Wanda are very funny
covid: on your right
🤩
Considering that mandolorian was able to make Disney+ one of the biggest streaming services on its own, I can’t wait to see what happens with the shows
Okay but Tom Hiddleston&#39;s voice though 😍😍😍 And my man Loki finally about to get the screen time that he deserves
so like how soon
I&#39;m just rewatching this in quarantine and being sad that all the shows are delayed
Please release this series in tamil also,because there are many fans in tamilnadu for marvel
Does anyone know what this song is
Please open Disney+ in Turkey please
Please bring in Raquel Welch 😻😎
Beautiful🥰🎈💞💞
Every who bought disney plus and waiting for series <br>Corona: lets ruin there lifes

I don&#39;t see that in Disney + hotstar I searched but I couldn&#39;t find this

Mandoralion season 1 ends.....<br>Marvel -Now its the starting
There’s always those people who didn’t even watch the super bowl and are just finding out <br><br><b>oh wait...</b>
I think it’s best trailer ever.👍🏻
Awsome
I’m over all this, it got annoyed waiting for stuff. I think all the prolonged waiting and covid19 soured me on The MCU. Not exciting anymore.
Omgoooooodddddd
Anyone else here from recommendations 3 months later?

I’m finna be the boomer the actual Loki we know is dead that’s the past Loki that relives the same day over and over but just got ahold to the Tesseract
In my opinion we should get a Ghost Show. I think it’s the perfect way to follow her story.
It’s been 2 months.. I need more WandaVision content
petition for bucky to grow his hair long again <br>⬇️
All is well and good marvel but how close is “soon”?? I need these now lmao
Azteca 7 Canal 5 Marvel
falcon and winter soldier nice
The series will be in premium only on VIP only
&quot;The Universe is expanding...&quot;<br><br>Yeah, so is your MONEY, Disney.
Wow
Loki got only 5 seconds but this gives much chills
i could do this all day
Captain America + Falcon= Captain Falcon :O
This was pretty “LOKI” if u know what I mean
Bucky was trying to shoot Helmut Zemo, right?
What does Loki said?
Is Incredible
Anyone want to explain to me what wandavision is about. I’m honestly so confused. It seems like an 80s sitcom for some reason.
BRING BACK DAREDEVIL
Who else is watching this during quarantine?

Marvel : The Universe is expanding..<br>Me : &amp; also delaying 😭😭
I want spider-man !
In my opinion there&#39;s a lot of theories, why WandaVision could be called that way, without necessarily saying it&#39;s because of &quot;Wanda &amp; Vision&quot;<br>Here are some examples:<br>1.) Pointing to Wanda&#39;s reality which is kind of her vision.<br>2.) Because it&#39;s Wanda&#39;s Vision. Her personal Vision whom she created.<br>3.) Wanda Vision, like, she married him, so henceforth it&#39;s her surname. (&gt;Vision resistance)<br>4.) Wanda is living in a sitcom kind of reality. Therefore she&#39;s in Television. But because it&#39;s her reality/her tv-show, it&#39;s called WandaVision instead of Television.<br><br>Those are my theories why the show could be named WandaVision without directly pointing out to Vision as the co-protagonist
