anazing
Kinda weird seeing felix dont swear in swedish.
The progess of Pewds in this game is like &quot;The Download is Fricking Me&quot; Meme.
i sub and like pls more jump king
I honestly wish he would try to beat it. The main map isn&#39;t even that long or hard
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=630">10:30</a> - for the old times sake &lt;3
I have completed it in just one hour on my YouTube channel 😎😎👌👌
PewDiePie is such a delight to watch!!! &lt;3 :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=550">9:10</a> goat scream
I don&#39;t think you can checkpoint if you can&#39;t die
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=323">5:23</a> good question <br>Maybe she as well has such huge leg muscles and is better at jumping
The sound when you hit the ground after a fall makes this game so much funnier than it should be.
I finally got the babe. And i watch this smugly with the dopamine rush still permeating my body. Life is good.
Someone please tell me what he says in Swedish at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=632">10:32</a> please… 💀😂💀😂💀
tf this didn&#39;t get recommended to me til now; also pls continue this
كرنج
there will be blodshed
This game reminds me of Pogostuck where Markiplier absolutely lost his marbles at. Still think that is one of the worst rage games ever made.
the nickelback shirt ties this all together fantastically
colosal drain more like colosal pain
Jump King is AaaSss
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg">0:00</a> At the start of the video, immediately don&#39;t tell Marzia productions
That Cry was just Epic😂😂😂
Hey pewds, did you legit lose from that game, that is the first game you didn&#39;t finish I think. Whoa that&#39;s huge
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=284">4:44</a> My motivation 😌

The little girl voice is very jarring
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=780">13:00</a> I love this voice you can just tell he&#39;s regretting everything xD
when you realize he looks younger here than when he plays getting over it.
Felix: <b>swears in Swedish</b><br><br><br>Auto-generated captions: <b>MNM out of victims Japan stop</b><br><br><b>y e s</b>
Does anybody have any idea what the background music he uses in his videos that sounds really happy
Please tell me what he said at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=632">10:32</a>

I see rage quits are back in fashion 😏
&quot;Äe men det var då fittans jävla fanskap&#39; = MNM out of victims Japan stop. 100% accurate subs by youtubes autogen. This is how you greet people in Sweden.

It’s so hard to watch
Lmao <br>As soon as I laughed,<br>Peers: Shut up! <br><br>😂 🤣🤣🤣
Holy mid rolls Batman
Honestly want to see more of this game
Love his reactions. Laughs, then rages. Literally the same as any gamer male playing any difficult game like this. And the fake crying once in a while too. And also the random sounds at each and every jump. I just love seeing the gamer come out this entire video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=630">10:30</a> <b>REVERTS TO PRIMAL FORM</b>

Jack made it further. Lmao
It&#39;s always entertaining to watch Pewds play. 👊🏻
Felix: I don&#39;t care about hot babe! I have hot babe at home. <br><br><br>Me: Aww.
You know he is going insane when he starts swearing in swedish

The video was originally called leg reveal with a leg as the thumbnail. You ain&#39;t slick felix.
I played this game before makes me angry i swore alot and i broke things up
So this is like the &quot;Getting Over It&quot; but pixelated and mediavalized?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=138">2:18</a> Did you gamers noticed the Tyrant/Mr. X footstep sound effect?
i really enjoyed this video. you made my day thanks😊
Me: I knew it<br>Pewds: SHUT UP
Dat nickelback tee tho
“You can’t hurt me because I’m already broken inside”-pewds 2020 <br>Literally the truest statement I’ve heard thus far
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=464">7:44</a> Reminds me of DDLC Sayori :DD
Jackspectieye was way better than Pewds for real<br>The Irish Gladiator won&#39;t stumbl

When he went <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=550">09:10</a> I felt that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=512">8:32</a> Why do you think streamers play it.
Speed running this game is worthless
Ive been laughin so hard

This is why felix should take a break.
If you pick your nose than eat it. than poop it out IN the toilet than eat the poop will it taste salty? -asking for a friend
R.I.P  PewDiePie
Who else finds it funny when he falls down?
pewds raging is the funniest thing ever
It’s good to see Pewds returning to the days of screeching and grunting as commentary
This is the reason why I sometimes hate games with platforms...
Basically just like Dark Souls.
hola a todos
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=424">7:04</a><br><br>Felix: I&#39;m not taking any chances<br><br>Also Felix: Takes a chance and misses the platform
Let&#39;s say he does get up there. Let&#39;s say there is a cut scene for when he gets up there showing the smokin hot babe and all her glory. Her sexy blonde hair glowing in the sun. She turns around to finally reveal her creamy, orgasmic face...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>It turns out to be that same old man that was there from the start with a wig on...
This video is one of the most priceless on YouTube. Seeing the character fall flat on its face is just insanely funny
I’m getting flashbacks of a man in a Coldren and a hammer by his side
we need more of this
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=505">8:25</a> the dude is laying down on his face<br><br><br>Physics
I would probably take a gun to my own head after trying to play this and failing this much

When he’s filming videos marzia probably scared because he’s just screaming every three seconds
Can someone please translate Felixs rage for me please?

so this is a 14 min video of pewds slowly going insane
i&#39;ve never been this stressful in my life
Please do more. I&#39;ve never laughed harder at any of your videos
Notice me pewds senpai
should be titled: <b>Felix slowly loses his sanity and becomes something not of this earth</b>
Getting over it pt. 2 questionmark?
this just reminded me of the era when he put on a bald cap and had a sledge hammer
When he says I’m not taking any chances. Falls all the way down
I can’t stop laughing whenever he messes up and falls all the way down
Newest comment

You know it&#39;s serious when he starts summoning Satan in Swedish
Next thing u know the man gets  inside a pot and climbs with a hamer (arm day)
Hey pewds, I personally would love to see you play something like, AM2R, I understand that wouldnt really preform as a video all that well but, it would be awesome to see you grow and get better as you get farther. or Super Metroid. Both highly acclaimed games. Maybe consider if you see this comment!
The grammar in the title ._________________________________________.
Felix when he holds back from saying the &quot;N&quot; word:

This game is not 4 u pewds
Pt2????
I honestly want to see him finish it.
If you see a Swedish man running at you yelling “BOGA BOGA BOGA” you should know it’s already too late
This reminds me of getting over it 😂 😅 <br>Anyone else?
they must have forgot!
If you hate this than you mist try out &quot;Nela Zviadi&quot;. Avilable in app store and google play. That game is not english but you will rage anyways. I dare you to play that game. Good luck 😉

So this game is basically Getting Over It with Shovel Knight’s Chad brother
<i>I jump all day</i><br><i>I jump all night</i><br><i>I jump non-stop</i><br><i>Till that babe is mine</i><br><br><i>And I jump to right</i><br><i>I jump to left</i><br><i>I jump up and down</i><br><b><i>But now I don&#39;t care</i></b><br>(Coz I&#39;m married 😄) <br>(And I have a great wife 😆)<br><br>Thank you~

This video gave me a stroke
Make this a ten part series where pewds slowly loses his sanity and obsesses over finishing it

After all the sanity he had lost all he earned is a cap :&lt;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6_yurXCJg&amp;t=806">13:26</a> <br>Pewds : Don&#39;t fuck this up Felix..<br><b>Falls down</b><br>Pewds : NO ONE&#39;S PERFECT !!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>Loved that 😂

Never felt more happy to see pewds suffer from a video game before
He is not raging guys, he is happy and smiling with a high pitch sound.
Wasn’t this video called ‘leg reveal’ ?
I think the desk will not resist until the end of this game...
The new Getting Over It game
Love how &quot;calmly&quot; he says in the end that he doesn&#39;t care, and then ends it with says that he has a hot babe at home
getting over it 2.0
i wish he would play more impossible games?
<b>I. WANT. MOOOOOORE</b>
