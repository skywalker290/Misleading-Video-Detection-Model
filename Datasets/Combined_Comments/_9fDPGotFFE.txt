Eskimo is a derogatory term. Inuit is what they prefer to be referred to as.
I member this on ebaumsworld before utub
BY THE WAY THIS IS FAKE
I’m an inuk if you guys call us Eskimo that is racist to us
People laughing on a tragedy no humanity left in this world
I love how you can hear his final scream as he’s pulled underneath
MAMMA MIA!
ATTENTION:  GIVE YOUR LIFE TO THE LORD JESUS CHRIST OR HELL WILL BE YOUR FINAL RESTING PLACE.
Lol
Is that fake yup its fake
I really love dog movies online. They often make me laugh. BUT a large percentage of regular people are slowly and gradually KILLING their family dogs (without noticing it). The junk dog food companies use into pet food provokes cancerous cells and tends to make pet dogs pass away early..

If you have a pet dog and you would like to conserve its life and be sure your doggie lives for longer then you need to look at Double Life Dog Diet (Look in Google.) It’s what I have done.
Actually the Inuit are a tribespeople that make up part of the Eskimo ethnic group, Eskimo is a broad term for the tribespeople of Greenland Alaska and Northern Canada- to call the Kalaallit or the Yuprit tribes &quot;Inuit&quot; is like referring to all Africans as Nigerians. The Yupik tribe of Northern Alaska don&#39;t even know what &#39;Inuit&#39; means - there is no such word in their language. 
Nobody cares.
He&#39;s been kicked in the ICEHOLE!
Lawl!
inuit r a lot smarter then that      and we are called INUIT not eskimo 

Well....it looked like he was fishing. I guess the whale was chasing the fish that caught the bait. Either way, this is heart stopping
Obviously.  
How the wale.know that papa.is there.it cant be real...
How the wale kniw that papa  there...ut can be real.amd who made this video... Eskimos no have tv ,xbox,phone or camera...
Lol

I finally thought I found one....just one. One measly video without this stupid comment. This one word comment that bugs the shit outta me when I see it. I&#39;m lookin at you, @Balin85
Shat myself......
I jumped....
@The1997Pancake Don&#39;t worry i laughed to!!XD
Am I the only one who fell off my chair laughing at this?
What are you people talking about?? This vid is totally real....whale FTW! :D
idk about this, it looks a little fake
He got ulted by Fizz from LoL

@DayDemons :)
@DayDemons The killer whale is animated.
Yes, because whales roar.
It this was true, i truly feel sorry for the eskimo BUT.........i can&#39;t help LOL-ing!!!! The tugging part was way to HILARIOUS!!!
Is it bad that I laughed my ass off when I saw this?
FAKE!!!!

FAKE!!!!

@noahsb9 why?
@hoh8511no  thats not true.  Orca&#39;s eat olso human if the will. It happend sometime.
hahahahahahahaha
when the killer ate the eskimo i fucking shit myself
keep hitting 9
Yeah I remember the this commercial. I like the man fights bear one. Silly bear, next time watch your nuts.
why i don&#39;t go ice fishing... 
@lawtonokieguy this video isn&#39;t meant to be serious. and I believe orcas are protected in alaskan waters.
Haha this makes me laugh
Stupid ppl what you get for hunting the poor whales....
@someguy6978 Weird thing is, only captive Killer Whales attack and kill humans. Never wild ones.
Yes this is a commercial people....I don&#39;t believe Killer whales attack humans...Never heard of it anyway
Why didnt you save the guy
....GOOD WHALE :D
Lol
This is a British TV advert from about ten years ago and if I remember correctly it was for fish fingers (fish sticks). That is why the guy is going on about Omega3 as the next shot is &quot;for an easier way to get omega 3 eat fish fingers&quot; - most adverts in the UK are weird like this.
no way this is real. if it was real, why would someone be fiming it. It never gets old though!!!!!
NOO this is REAL, you know???!! hahaha
If u commented something like this &quot;this is fake&quot; then your an idiot it&#39;s a commercial so no shit it&#39;s fake!
F-A-K-E thumbs you if you think it is fake!!! 
@Garretthierisser no, its not. you can tell.
If you think this is real... Good luck in life cause you really need it!
I knew something was gonna happen like that as soon as he started reeling in :I
@watchmyshoes22 no, it is real
this is so fake
@kingklabe No one lived to tell the tale......
TV ad - John West Tuna i&#39;m fairly sure.
woah that scared me
Did he died?

Do we really need people to tell us that this is fake? When you&#39;re at the movies, do you yell out FAKE! everytime theres a special effect?
Fake and gay
&quot;Man vs. Wild&quot; - Deleated scene. ^^
In Soviet Russia, Fish Catch YOU!
Well Didn&#39;t the cameraman run after the poor eskimo??!!
@DrMMHMD That could well be the most logical reason.
If you want to see some real action then youtube search this:

Have a nice weekend. 
x
@xREDGHOSTRIDERx Yeah hence the &quot;documented&quot; part.

Wow - people are getting way too upset about the Soviet Russia comment. Its a Family Guy reference
inuit eskimo? kind of redundant since they&#39;re both a name for my people.  ah well, i guess eskimo is a term more easily recognized than &quot;inuk&quot; or &quot;inuit&quot;
@DragonBall2118 ....you my friend are smart
Hey!!! That&#39;s my uncle you bastards!!!
@TINGShappen Hilarious but definitely not real NO.
There isn&#39;t a single documented case of a killer whale attacking a human in the wild.

This is the outcome of Free Willy 
...........and that made me give up my ideas of living in Antarctica! O.o
Armadillos lurk in your toaster.
@DragonBall2118 In Soviet Russia, Soviet spreads you!

LOL

Niice, but totally fake. Hillarious!

@esseNtialMediaAU 

And furthermore, Killer whales do not live that far north.  Unlike Narwhals and Belugas, they are not equipped to operate under the ice floes.
lol
Killer whales are not that big. I know because there are a lot of them in Puget sound. That one would have to have been 40 feet.
@daedrick Its not, I saw it on the news
@watchmyshoes22 LOL, oh really?! *shakehead*
This isn&#39;t fake
@MasterFoMagic Lol, inform yourself before looking stupid. They are found in all of the world&#39;s oceans INCLUDING Artic and Antartic regions.

Killer whales don&#39;t have brakes. So brakeing through ice is impossible. They also can&#39;t break through ice that thick. 

You&#39;re so silly xXxXxxXXxXXXXLindsayXXXxxXXxxxXXxxXXxXx
Killer Whales can Do ANYTHING!!
They invented the Jet Engine First

You, sir, are and idiot.
I think this is a fake. This is hard to break through the thick ice from the sea.Even this is a shark.
oh my god how could they make a commercial out of this those basterds!
lol bad luck
lmmfao cute
Like you, I can&#39;t believe the amount of bafoons that are coming on here and are willing to take it at face value and shout FAKE at the end. If these idiots don&#39;t get it, the human race is in real trouble.

why would anyone film anything so seemingly uneventful as fishing?  just a coincidence the whale came eh?
come on, even age of empires looks more real
It is not bitching. It is defending the human race.
Called me dumb, but I still think that guy was killed cold blood by that whale. My condolence to his family.
lol
who said it was real killjoy go bitch somewhere else
freakin shit!I got shocked when the whale suddenly popped out
I still think is real man. Technology is not that advance. Those whales are dangerous.  It is the reason why I don&#39;t go to Alaska.
Ok I&#39;ll bring some stones.
Meet me in Antartida.
LOLLLLLL
Wow, that should not be played in Youtube. Poor man. Lets hunt that killer wale.

Then worlds collide. Just read the comments. &quot;The stupid. It burns!&quot;
please dont explain ur reasons why its fake... thtas jst being retarded. its obviously not real but its funny so just sssshhhh.
People feel good by pointing out the obvious I guess.
yes its clearly fake....just so back up knowledge, the whale doesnt move, its the picture moving, and the ice breaks b4 the whale appears, and whales wouldnt swim through solid ice

Maybe you didn&#39;t write a good description, maybe you didn&#39;t put good tags in it so no one found your videos. Tags are there for a reason! 
no tags = no views.
I think that it was the skimo yelling his lungs out in dispair while the predator dragged his ass down the piercing cold water...

...but that&#39;s just me, you know. I&#39;m just sayin&#39;...

I feel like I have to be the geek who points out that Inuit Eskimo is redundant: the two words mean the same thing (although one is politically-correct and one ain&#39;t). Also, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ever been an attack by a wild Orca on a human, but I could be wrong.  And yes, I know this is a joke, so none of it matters anyways (so you don&#39;t have to jump all over me and inform me of that...)
lmao, i love this!!!

Duh....you dope.
