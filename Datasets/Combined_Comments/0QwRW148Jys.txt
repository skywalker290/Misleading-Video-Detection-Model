I feel like I&#39;ve seen this exact barbeque somewhere else
Stop spreading rumours when you&#39;re probably not even bird experts like me. If you claim you are, you&#39;re probably lying.
Day in the life of a true Melbourne geezer
Bought yt premium just to download this masterpiece
So FAKE!!!
Is that a fucking brown snake
Just wow....
Death from above
Nature does drone strikes in Australia
clickbait
fake
Xenophobic Hawk
It wanted to throw a snake on the barbie.
FAKE
Hawk: here’s your dessert!
This had me gasping for air. That bird ain&#39;t shit!
For all those stingy people and scrounges out there who don&#39;t bring food to parties.... even a hawk realizes he has to bring food to the barbecue😉
PROOF....THAT THE EARTH IS FLAT!
The wing movements don&#39;t look realistic
Did snake bite the legs?
That hark attacked the asians. The hawk is racist!
Well, that was....hawkward!
Can&#39;t blame the hawk for dropping it
very bad actors
If Ozzy Man Reviewed This
Yeah watch in 0.25 it&#39;s not fake. Low res yeah but not fake. Snake doesn&#39;t look cgi at all which some people are suggesting, if this is fake it&#39;s studio level animations. Like the people who made the movie 9 type shit. No fuckin way.
Looks fake
lol, CONVICTS  spotted, keep your mouth shut ya junks, you are nothing but descendants of shit thrown out from england.dumbfuks
I&#39;m not racist<br>I just dispose chubby, younger-than-fifteen Asian girls.<br>Especially when they have a cold<br>(Fuck you, Alice)
fake
Lol that was kinda funny
Am I the only one that laughed?
nice fucking CG

Hawk throws fuck all - Nerd fools You Tube is the updated title.
Who else totally freaked out when you thought the snake was coming in your face from the screen
The snakes not even in its claws it&#39;s just fucking floating
This is fake af if you watch closely the snake just appears in the Hawks claws
Someone get billschannel
Stop with all this fake shit.
This looks so fake - at the end you can tell the snake is animated. Even from the start the snake appeared out of thin air
That bird is a dick and man it&#39;s funny :D
What you couldn&#39;t see was the snake had a big Tunnelweb spider in it&#39;s mouth and it spat that out at the tourists before it landed. The spider had given a piggyback to some fire ants and they jumped for the tourists too. The fact that they all missed showed a lack of true dedication and flat out sucked.
That&#39;s amazing hahaha
Welcome to Australia were animals throw food at you
No one gets their dick out for a snake...
I thought it said &quot;Hank throws snake at family eating lunch in Melbourne&quot;
fake and gay
Meanwhile in Australia tourists are running a fuck
quite possibly the funniest thing I&#39;ve Eva seen
typical Australia lol flying snakes I LOVE MY COUNTRY
It&#39;s fake
Ahhhhhh!! WTF I&#39;m going to Aussie in a few days and this is better not be the welcoming I get 😱😵
Fake but amusing. I think the hawk was aiming at the bbq, mate. Nothing better than fried snake...
What fake rubbish. Why would you waist your time <br>producing it!
Nice, a Thug life candidate if ever I&#39;ve seen one!
Well welcome to Australia fellas
OMG😱😂
This is hilarious and all but it&#39;s so fake
First, there are no hawks in Melbourne or in Australia and second, the scene is 200% Chinese FAKE like the products they make in China. Not even being in Australia they learn how to make good videos, and third, I am not sure that is Melbourne... probably is a FAKE Chinese town.
how did that happen
Lol you can see that it magically appears in the halks mouth
Y,  v ip
Fake As
lol
that hawk had Alistair Clarkson in it&#39;s grips!
Vote for trump to get a wall one vote = one wall for a private company now that&#39;s a deal call now on 615867270
This isn&#39;t even in Melbourne...

&quot;You guys really could use more snake in your diet!&quot;
If this video came from New Zealand you would not be getting all these dumbshit comments... Most of you are descended from gang banging English folk, so chill
me how
It&#39;s a promotional video made by Hawthorn ahead of the finals series. Calm down foreigners.
He wanted you to cook it.
For a start that is way too big to be a hawk.
Complete fake AF.... Snake appears out of nowhere
That looked real.......
Maybe the Chinese people cooking a dog or cat pissing the bird off so the snake helped out too
Fake, the way it moves in the air imo
bullshit...good video
Acquire liberty wind envelope anxious
I guess that hawk really &#39;slithered in&#39; am I right?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;ll leave now.
That was the fakest bird I&#39;ve seen since Birdemic Shock and Terror
Afl finals, hawthorn
1000% Fake.. DON&#39;T let the Chinese howls distract you. Look at the pixels and see for yourself my children. All is visible under the lens of 720p

And his name was Sum Ting Wong
the hawk must be protecting his/her territory and maybe has a nest near where they are...very lucky to have video and were able to catch this when it happened...thanks for sharing...
Good work by the Hawthorn Football Club!
Welcome to Australia
The bird was like &quot;Hey you want to fuckin look at me Ave a look at this bitch&quot;

It&#39;s fake, it was a marketing stunt.
Welcome to Australia Mate!
fake
Is anyone else surprised to see a snake in Melbourne? I&#39;ve lived here my whole life and never seen so much as a dead one.
Even eagles hate multiculturalism.
Maybe it was an Uber hawk dropping off a fare.
Fake
Christ, even the wild animals here are racist bigots.
this is cgi. nice! i love how some people just believe everything they see! haha! so good
thats cheeky. i have a rattus like that.
1. all the top schools are made of 80%+ asians<br>2. we boosted the economy so much<br>3. we do no crime compared to blacks and whites (sorry but true :/ )<br>4. even though we have money, we still keep working hard and would like to represent australia<br>5. theres no logical reason for aussies to hate us.. we have not done anything wrong
fake bulllshit
What a nice Hawk!
So fake
Viral.
😂😂 racism could be associated with this video
A viral fake to promote a footy game that will be so good it does not need promotion.For the record: in Australia Hawks do not do that they seek smaller prey e.g. mice, rats, lizards. However, kookaburras will attack and kill very dangerous snakes.
Fake a snake wont run it defend it self if it feel threaten
Bro where&#39;s the fish and chips at?
Don&#39;t make fake shit like this please
So who here likes anal?

Racist Hawk 😂😂😂😂
Good Hawk:)
Australians can be so embarrassing fucking hell.
lol
snake hate cginks
WHO THROWS A SNAKE?! HONESTLY.
if the like button was a dislike button, how many dislikes can i get?
It just wanted it cooked, it missed the BBQ.
A hawk and a snake have driven all racism cunts a orgasm.
That hawk is my spirit animal
the snake and hawk are very beautiful in this video. will save it to my animal playlist
holy shit that snake was fast
Man guns are the best thing to happen to the world in a long while 👌
Fake................
No.. No.. No..  That&#39;s my favorite yarra BBQ spot..  never ever have I seen snakes there  😭😭😰

Translation: that snake looks yum drop it on the grill
just eat the snake. It&#39;s no big deal for you right?
FOI MAL FOI MAL 😅😂
Fuk that i would spew
very missleading title I expected tony hawk to just come out of no where amd just throw the snake at the family
Checking in with Air Control... Deploying Wiggles now, over.<br>- Snake attack -
The snake literally appeared out tif now ware...
I thought they would eat it
This is fake
these dislikes and racists comments is just a reflection of what immigrants face in Australia by hick people
Half the racist Australians in these comments must live in Mt Isa. You racist pigs make me feel embarrassed to be an Australian!
fake as fuck
niekurwa nie widzac ze to fake
HOLY CRAP
The hawk was trying to save the dog they were about to eat.
SEXIEST...
I saw the gif of this on reddit days ago, but it&#39;s way more hilarious with Asians anxiously talking over it.
Fake.  Snake way too big for the hawk to carry it as depicted.  Nice effort though.  Wedge Tail Eagles will attack snakes in Australia, but usually smaller than their own bodyweight.
Love all these im guessing Americans commenting on how Racists Aussies are, for one theres racists (fuck wits) every were, 2 im pretty sure its the American racial cop shootings you hear every 2nd day not Australia (Oh wait our gun laws made it so we havnt had a mass shooting in 25 years, its okay you will catch up one day America)
fuck me... that hawk is one aggressive basted LOL👍
FAKE
cannot believe Australia is so racism like dick, so sad for my family decision that  immigrate into here. even you dont make any trouble and try to nice, work hard for this contry. fucking deeply sad.
Fake!
see its wings its animted
fake af
, PS, your country is not yours so if you don&#39;t like asians, u leave sweety, even in first world countries, education is available, racism still exists how sad
The ultimate team, hawk and snake.
looks fake..
TOTALLY FAKE: It&#39;s a 3D animation..  this coming from someone who does 3D modelling and animation (3dsmax) from time to time. And who gets so excited just to see a hawk (even before it appears in the shot)?
I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s fake. It&#39;s funny damnit!
did you hear them saying, ohh aah, ooh ahh, what was that
TRENDING!!!!
Looks kinda fake. No reflection from bird flying overhead at all and snake seems kinda computerish
its fake people.....
these pan heads not fooling no one.....shit is sooo fuckin fake
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QwRW148Jys&amp;t=29">0:29</a> you can see on the box Geelong Cats explains since they are Asian(Yes I&#39;m Asians but I don&#39;t eat cats ok for fuck sake I was born in New Zealand but am mostly Chinese)
It looks so fake.
Don&#39;t lie those Asians cut the video because they&#39;re were gonna eat it
snakes never drop their lunch..FAKE
Racist hawk
All i got to say is the hawk is a savage
ould be a killstreak in cod LMAO
It&#39;s funny how all the closet racists mysteriously come out from the shadows once a keyboard and computer screen is in front of them hahaha
this is why I never leave my house
the bird did 911
Why listen to radio national or the ABC when we have 3AW ?
The racism is unreal!
watch at 0.5,  the CGI is noticeable xD
That Hawk is savage af
quality content
This is pretty fake, though is their some sort of meaning to the video?
SO FAKE I love how these people make me laugh 😂😃😂
here throw this on the barbie
notice how snake apears outta nowhere? good editing tho
Even though I&#39; not Asian, this non sense is killing me. Why the hell do all Asians get so much hate for being good at everything....<br>They make up our economy, community and also our society.<br>We would be stuffed without them.<br>👍if u agree
wow<br><br><br><br><br>hawks are dicks
Fake
how is this fake
All of the Australians being racist in the comments makes me sick, be mature. Why do you think we get stereo-typed as racist? Because of you sick people. I thought we were better than this.
Racist hawk. Get those Asians out of Australia
Wow so realistic......
surprised they didn&#39;t eat it
skate aren&#39;t bad and why is their so much talk about Aussie.                     with we (Aussies) had a snake dropped on us we would call the hawk a basted and walk off
Cats are still gonna win, Hawthorn! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nicetry">#nicetry</a>
idk why I find this so funny
Due this is totally fucking fake
i guesshe didnt like being pointed at
Fake<br>1. Camera did not move when bird was flying at her face.<br>2. The bird did not visibly pick anything up off the ground.<br>3. Do not think those snakes even live in Melbourne cbd.
not cool
gold
What&#39;s wrong with Asian people? They just come here, work really hard and rarely ever cause anyone any trouble.
Lol that bird is just rude!
savage af
Why is the Camera Dude just standing there? Like run cos Every snake In Aus is venomous.
I would shit myself if that happened to me. I am absolutely terrified of snakes
I am appalled by the comments on this video. This is a video of a bird and a snake. Please enlighten me on how it has anything to do with race and racism. A good majority of you people should grow up. We are ONE RACE CALLED THE HUMAN RACE!
When you live in Australia...
k it looked fake from the start, but you could have atleast cut it before the snake &quot;crawled&quot; away, that bit was like 90s CGI XD
even if this was real its still funny
wow...I&#39;m predicting comments will be disabled within a week.
welcome to Australia ahahah
That was pretty cool.
if I get 500 sub&#39;s I&#39;ll do the watch me whip , watch me nae nae in a shopping mall and record it !!!!  this week

get out where full
If you can understand Madarine you will immediately  recognise  that the accent is actually not mainland Chinese and the whole thing sounds very very fake.
Looks kinda fake like that video &#39;golden eagle snatches kid&#39;
I regretted clicking into this video to see so many offending comments against Chinese/Asian, it was just showing that they were scared by the snack in family lunch, how&#39;s that even trigger the racism fight? Imagine if the family were black people, would you guys comment the same things? Racism is intolerable no matter what races.
Fake.
looks fake to me
omg

Chinese people? Nah, This is fake bro.
Hello. I am not a scholar,have much to learn, and to grow.<br>However<br> my experience with Jesus is this. I became a TRUE believer around 2 <br>years ago, but i went to church before that but just to meet girls, hang<br> out with friends, etc. However there was a time where i lost everything<br> and was depressed but at that time, i blamed everything on God because i<br> thought he was supposed to &#39;get rid&#39; of all pain and hurts. So i <br>firstly cursed God and hated him, feeling suicidal but then i decided to<br> learn more about this God and the reason why people follow him. I <br>listened to famous preachers like nick vujcicic the man without arms, <br>francis chan, all whom i strongly recommend to you. After i TRULY <br>accepted Jesus into my life, i slowly started to see my life change SOO <br>much for the better and i started to have PEACE and hope. YES, i still <br>had doubts whether christianity was another myth just like buddhism or <br>other religions but time and time again Jesus would prove me otherwise. I<br> have NOT seen Jesus face to face, but i have met people and still have <br>fellowship with people especially my pastor who i have known for quite a<br> long time how Jesus showed himself phyically to her when she was 23 <br>years old. Now she is 55. She still remembers it like it was yesterday <br>and she also heard God&#39;s voice. <br>God showed me many dreams and <br>visions about him, whenever i feel like straying away from him, he would<br> ALWAYS bring me back. I thank him for this. I have seen miracles, had <br>my lower back/ disc problem that i could not fix for a year, healed <br>instantly in 5 seconds through prayer, and much more. I KNOW God is real<br> and that Jesus is the name. Also when i read the bible/scriptures, like<br> proverbs, i cant believe how REAL they are and they prove themselves in<br> my life. ALSO, the bible has MANY prophecies written as far back as <br>2000BC, that is being fulfilled right now and has ben fulfilled such as <br>wars and the fall of kingdoms that even history books cannot deny.<br>Yes<br> there are some TOO EXTREME christians who are legalistic and put up <br>signs saying &quot;God hates fags&quot; which he doesn&#39;t, because he created <br>everyone. However please know that Christianity is the only religion <br>where the God died on the cross and showed his love for us. No other <br>religion did that. Christ is LOVE. Therefore christians are commanded to<br> love other people to the point up sacrificing their own life just like <br>how Jesus sacrificed his life for us.
lol
omg
Scary I live in aussie

Australia in a nutshell.
Hey does the hawk turn without actually leaning to the side? Also when it comes it looks like it is edited in... oh wait, it is
It&#39;s fake
Am I the only one here that&#39;s Australian, from Melbourne and lives in the suburb, Camberwell?... Oh, I am? Ok... I&#39;ll go...

Chinese immigrants are good for this country. They open businesses, invest, send their kids to school and best of all, no crazy religious crap. Much better than the &#39;other option&#39;, right? Apologies on behalf of Australia for all the uninformed dickheads out there...
fake
&quot;I said SHRIMP on the barbie, not SNAKE!&quot;
Meanwhile, in Australia...
I can&#39;t tell whether this is real or not.
I&#39;m laughing. Probably shouldn&#39;t be, but I am.
1-2 videos posted each week will provide you with laughs and disbelief as we bring you the best GTA V content you will hopefully see!
dont asians eat snake? Should of just thrown it on the barbie...
Asians are such hypocrites because as soon as someone is racist to them they&#39;re all like racism isn&#39;t cool but they&#39;re racist and prejudice to dark skin people.
I believe it to be real based on my still shots, no expert though looked legit snatching up that brown snake.  Either way it&#39;s pretty cool!
hawk think we are full
why don&#39;t you just turn off comments then you don&#39;t have to put up with such crap. 3AW take some responsibility.
i feel like if this was real you wouldn&#39;t stop recording, especially Asian tourists lol
Wow...nature is so funny! That hawk is searching for food and the people must be interrupting him!
Looks like CGI to me.. But anyways I won&#39;t scroll down anymore there are too much racism in the lower comment section area.
AUSTRALIA MATE
fake
the racist hawk of Melbourne strikes again
THESE COMMENTS ARE GIVING ME AIDS THIS IS PROBABLY FUCKING FAKE ANYWAY JESUS CHRIST
if u look closely the snake bit the hawk and so the hawk dropped it
OMG
The Australians in these comments are so fucking rude they put our country to shame. Sorry to everyone being offended by these idiots, they&#39;re just shitty people who think that &#39;White is Right&#39; all the time and can&#39;t accept that other colours exist.
i like how if you pause at 0.23 you&#39;ll see a magpie just sitting their watching them run and scream
Those Chinese people are just like. RUN QUICK RUN. I would be screaming like baby if that happened to me
Poor Hawk contracted Pauline Hansons disease.
For gods sake, the hawk didn&#39;t &#39;throw&#39; it at them, it dropped it.
&quot;Oh deres a awk&quot; okay I&#39;ll leave
Non white can never be Australian
Straya
Australia is a racist country people, we don&#39;t get offended as easily. Shut up
This is the most Australian thing ever
lololololololo
Which part of Melbourne? I&#39;m from Melbourne but I don&#39;t recall any Hawks or snakes near here.
hilarious
Half of the people in the comments are blind af. This is noticeably fake.
I love that hawk
Wtf racism is so rude and why are so many people being racist in the comment section if your not an aboriginal In a country you don&#39;t get to tell anyone to go back home
the hawk was like FUCK OFF WERE FULL! classic Aussie wild life
Was that mission 51?
Phew it is fake I was legit worried still what was the point of stunt?
There&#39;s no way this is real!!!
CGI. Besides that... these days getting a snake dropped on you equals oh shit I&#39;m gonna die let&#39;s all run away screaming.
Oh my god it&#39;s a fake the snakes fake its computer generated 😒
Oh my god was on the news and it&#39;s a fake
fake as my tits
welcome to Australia,  where shit that&#39;s trying to kill you teams up with some other shit that&#39;s trying to kill you,  to try and kill you together.
The Hawks is just like, &quot;Welcome to Australia my Asian friend. First, we&#39;re going to learn about snakes...&quot;
Thats Australia for ya!
FAKE!
Thats a Australia more ya!
Fake
bad fake, nice pr for 3awradio.
Asian for &#39;very fake...very fake!&#39;.
Something something Harambe
A hawk with humor.. Thank you vely funny!
Guys its very important to shift the racism in a new direction.  We need to stop saying &quot;asians&quot;. Not all asians are bad citizens  and its unfair to paint everyone with the same poorly made in china brush.  The ones everyone universally hates in every western country is the mainland Chinese people.  So lets galvanize our disdain behind this group.  This way its not racist, Ive identified the source, now we just need to solve the problem by teaching them manners and how to be good human citizens. Waiting in line and not pushing, holding doors for people, not spitting on the streets, brushing your teeth, simple things we do in the west that they are not used to.  Stop and help them and train them how to behave like good citizens because they are here to stay.
fake af XD <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QwRW148Jys&amp;t=21">0:21</a>
😨 👍   
wow that&#39;s a one in a lifetime video.
poor little concrete.
We can&#39;t build a wall so we train our wild life instead
So many racists here... I&#39;m a 17 year old Chinese, born in Australia and I&#39;ve received education from Australia and I&#39;m probably more intelligent than half the racist bogans in this comment section
montagem mau feita! hahaha<br>olha o tamanho da cobra quando supostamente o gavião a pega. e depois ela fica enorme!
It was a promo by Hawthorn Football Club to promote their upcoming finals campaign. They play Geelong in a Qualifying Final, and right at the end you can see an esky with a Geelong Cats sticker. I think the promo was about the Hawks &quot;On the Hunt&quot;, or something like that.
Hawk: &quot;Film this motherfuckers!!!&quot;
Cause that wasn&#39;t fake
Geez, these comments make me ashamed to be Australian.. Sorry, everyone. We&#39;re not all like that.
of fucking course it did
I guess they were eating KFC
Never go to Australia... Even the fuckin fauna are racists
That&#39;s right slope heads, even the wildlife doesn&#39;t want you here.
Lol..
Word of caution, dont scroll into the comments.
They look Vietnamese, why not just eat the snake for lunch?
FAKE.....
yes you can die in Australia, but as a guy who dose special effects and animation this is so fake, the snake just appears, nice try though; even the &#39;hawk&#39; is on a super basic animation path, birds don&#39;t fly perfectly level as they turn or stay the same speed... lol! still entertaining though.
For fuck sake. It&#39;s fake.
Welcome to Australia!
Some said the family ordered snake as part of their lunch so the hawk was like didn&#39;t you order Chinese food here you go
&quot;Welcome to Australia, before you go outside please check the weather.&quot;
The hawk: welcome to Australia, here&#39;s a snake. Now fuck off back to China.
Fake when the hawk is flying in the first part you can&#39;t even see a snake in its claws
Fucking hell some of the racist Australians in this comment section makes me ashamed to be Australian
I Call fake
Of course their Asians
Just count yourself lucky it wasn&#39;t a dropbear..

He clearly prefers his snakes cooked on the BBQ - all those claiming this is fake seriously need to go outside once in a while geeks

Damn
I actually can&#39;t believe people think this is real... Come on, it was a joke made by the Hawthorn footy club
I was walking past and I saw that, it was so creepy
that&#39;s some good special effects
That was fake... set up by the hawthorn footy club.
That&#39;s an everyday occurrence over here in Australia.
The fakes shit ever
This video is so fake that it hurts!
So fake
Animals are fighting back. They&#39;re working together to fuck our lives up HAHA!
Tell me where I can buy a fake snake that slithers like that one!!
Yep that&#39;s Australia 😀
They hawe aliance
так вам и надо
Ohhhh Shit ! grab a pokeball !!!
&#39;straya
read YOU ARE PERFECT KEYS TO A TRANSFORMED LIFE?
Fake
Gake and fay.
hi
I don&#39;t know if this is real but there is one major thing i noticed. the hawk dives down to &quot;catch&quot; the snake when it takes of there is no snake.
Na Na Na Na Na Its the muthafucking D O double G
Welcome to Australia
That hawk obviously got something towards Asians. 😳😳😳🤔🤔🤔
Wow, only took a few minutes for the racism to break out.
fake!
Pete a, I don&#39;t normally comment on people that hide behind a keyboard, but what a wanka haha, seriously sitting at home so so unhappy with yourself and your insignificant life just clickin the mouse. I look anglosaxon but am part Chinese, so I hear and see it all the time due to what I do or don&#39;t look like. Your comments really don&#39;t worry me, its waht others feel from it, you&#39;d be one of those hide and seek types, never being man enough to say it to someone&#39;s face, behind a computer, a fence, after a person has past etc etc...pathetic person. But at least I can stand up for myself, unlike others, so where do you want to meet, anywhere , anytime, anyplace, for a man to man intellectual conversation, crowd welcome. Seriously, if you really believe what you say let&#39;s meet. Because all I can do atm is laugh at you and your pathetic identity. hahahaha. On the money Jane Tsiolis.
whenever there&#39;s a video that is related to Australia and being Asian in the slightest, prepare for a racist shitstorm in the youtube comments
That was....hawkward
FAAKE
fake
Hiroshima.
Acting is bad, CGI is terrible, their interaction and reaction is laughable. And the snakes movement isn&#39;t even near realistic. FAKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Why is there so much racism in the comments! Australia is a multi cultural country (meaning we have all kinds of races here) it&#39;s not racism it&#39;s normal! Get it right : /
This is fake. Edited in, rewatch it, you&#39;ll see.
Lol snakes don&#39;t move like that
Don&#39;t worry guys, it&#39;s just a new ingredient for lunch.
That means &quot;Get the fuck out of my country&quot;. And I agree with the bird.
fake?
guess what... its fake
This is a fake video from hawthorn to kick off there finals campaign to all the people who are saying it&#39;s fake if u look closely you see a Geelong sticker on the Esky
This is so fake hahaha 😂
Confirmed fake
HAWKZIRRA!
what a savage
This is why you don&#39;t come to Australia folks...
Their accents are Irish not Asian...
STRAYA!!
I think he&#39;s just trying to add more food in the grill. Hawk missed though.
That was fake.....   CGI for dummies
The hawk just wanted his lunch cooked too.
This was fake, because on the cooler when the snake falls, it has Geelong Cats on it for the AFL game against HAWTHORN. lol
Hey atleast Asians r smart
Faaaake the snake appears in midair the bird did not pick it up
worst than cgi star wars
Trading my Fearow for an Ekans
funny
OF COURSE THE SNAKE IS FAKE!!
Haha... Funny how people think this is real. In some of the scenes, they did even place the snake in the birds claws correctly. You&#39;re gonna have to do better to convince me.
more like he dropped it
I call Bullshit
He dropped the fucking snake!!!! he didn&#39;t  throw it at them.
The hawk was like &quot;I thought it&#39;s common to eat snakes in China.&quot;
This is soooo real
&#39;What to bring when your told not to bring a thing&#39;
Fake and gay
Hawk says go back to China xD
soooooooo fake
&quot;fuck off tourist&#39;s&quot; &quot;fuckin kaaaw&quot;!!!
Fake
Do people honestly think this is real? The snake literally appears out of thin air
Fake sh1t
Only in Melbourne were a hawk throws a snake at you
The cgi hawk had no cgi reflection on the water..
Faker then a soccer player trying to get a penalty
fake and gay
So fake😂😂😂
The CGI looks like it was done with Microsoft Paintbrush
imagine it was real lol
Watching the 9 news and they have just confirmed this is fake
Ha Ha ha ha ha h ah ah ah ah h ah ah hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhahahahah
F.O.B
Hawks can be real bastards.
Come on people, cgi or not this is still pretty good!  I laughed:)
Look it up on google its all over the media and radio its the real thing
Why running away? <br>...They should be thanking that hawk for bringing them snake dishes for lunch... how ungrateful.
The hawk just wanted to barbecue the snake a little thats all...
Australians call their country multicultural, yet all the comments here are Australians telling Asians to leave.
Damn what&#39;s with all the racism in the comments?
If you guys look closely the snake just appears out of nowhere. When the snake picks something up, u can&#39;t see the snake but if you watch it slowly as it comes towards the people, it randomly appears. I don&#39;t know what u think but i am pretty sure it&#39;s FAKE
That hawk is an OG
either this is fake or that is the bravest seagull for not even twitching when the &quot;hawk&quot; was diving
I&#39;ve given up
It&#39;s Pauline Hanson&#39;s Hawlucha.
Haha very fake
Hawkward
mal feito!

Australia... what are you gonna do?

&quot;Bombs away&quot;

I can&#39;t believe anyone would think this is real!
Hawk be like:<br>&quot;Taste...&quot;<br>&quot;My...&quot;<br>&quot;POWER.&quot;
If you rewatch the video at 0.5% speed, uninstall windows, and put on your night vision goggles you can actually see that the snake is just harambe

Welcome to Austrailia! Free snakes for everyone!
Looks kinda like a mamba; fuq dat.
cool video but its all CGI
this is the real youtube. amazing
So we are supposed to believe that the snake came out of nowhere?
this isn&#39;t fake. animals have a sense of humor too
lol this is so fake hahahahaha
They&#39;re pointing at that hawk as if it is Godzilla. It&#39;s just a bird...
Its funny cause there asian
This is the first time one of these fake CGI things actually had me fooled. Well done.
Dudes the snake looks like it un coiled
Their dinner was arriving via brand new delivery method
looks soo fake -_-
Its fake becuase, shakes are cold blooded and the hawk pick it up next to a river and it&#39;s cold still snakes dont come out until late September
Made me laugh since the idea&#39;s funny, but it was rather disappointing when I realized it was fake because of the hawk&#39;s unusual flight pattern, physics-breaking wing movements, and the snake&#39;s movement after being thrown was too fast...
The cgi was horrible
THIS IS FOR PEARL HARBOR
This isn&#39;t real Asians would&#39;ve grabbed the snake and ate it
neck the fuck up its fake but deece
So fake
Fake
Next time throw something on the bbq that they will eat like lulu my cat.
That was great CGI.
Do I even need to say its fake
Hawk: Hey! I see you&#39;re having a nice picnic!  You got enough food?  Here!  I&#39;ve got some grub and I&#39;m not really hungry.  You&#39;re welcome!
Where the fudge did the snake come from
XD
I say real.  Also i think it is a eagle, Wedge tailed eagle.   not a hawk.  because the wingspan is too wide, and the shape is not right for a hawk.   And that was a tiger snake just come out early spring along the river..   I have seen both Eagles and tiger snakes around damns etc.. this does not suprise me.   Eagle drop snake to kill it.
Strings tied to his leg and the rubber snake?
Yet another viral video making Australia look like an asian country
For everyone saying this is fake; it&#39;s actually REAL!<br><br>Can&#39;t believe it

They forgot to add reflections on the water.
care package inbound
if it was real that would be a real scream and a real run for life not like that

Wow a viral video in landscape mode <br>THE ASIANS GET IT
Everything wants to kill you in Australia but this just takes the cake

Strange how the hawk seems to be &#39;carrying the snake&#39; and the snake is invisible until it&#39;s like 15ft away
What a savage
tf u think this is 2011?
Teamwork at its finest
this is fake
plotting to steal my lucky charms
Q. How to tell if this is fake? <br>A. No reflection in water from &quot;bird&quot;<br>Your welcome

Hmmm it must be related to the crazy lady who throws cats at me.
This shit looks fake as fuck
haha now that was fake as hell, specialy when Hawk was flying tords them hahahahah
what an entrance by taylor swift a true icon tbh
i&#39;ll put another snake on the barbie
I think that was God saying;<br>&#39;ALL OF YOU HAVE POLLUTED MY EARTH, NOW YOU WILL FEEL NATURE&#39;S WRATH&#39;
The reactions justified
I heard that this bird flew to Australia just to catch a Kangaskhan but only found more fucking Ekans
Do we really need Capitan Dissolusion for this one. That snake looks faker than kim kardashian nasty ass plastics
Get the flight patterns right for a hawk and I shall be impressed.  C+ animation :/
that hawk is a gangster !<br>snake lives matter.
I found this too violent and gruesome. Youtube will now demonitize it.
Why do i think this is fake?
Nice Try.....How about Robotic Actioned Bird...throws semi realistic snake?
wtf?????
cgi snake son i am disappointed in you
harambe didnt die for this
bad cgi.. meh
Damn it America
The snake gets 2 times bigger only when it&#39;s like 2 metres away from the camera. And it looks animated if you look closely
For some reason I read &quot;Tony Hawk throws snake at a family&quot; I was like damn
Fake
that&#39;s not real.
That hawk was like &quot;Merica!&quot;
That hawk was like &quot;Merica!&quot;
Hawk = me, snake = my penis, family eating lunch = a female
Fake...totally an R.C  hawk....some sort of glue used on the talons
This is fake af
food on the go
they get free pickup and delivery LMAO.....
This looks extremely fake to me... Anyone else?
This video is fake. 1: Hawks never circle so tightly without banking (think of a plane going in to land) This motion is nothing more than a animation on a curve in 3D.<br>2: No reflection in the water, no shadow near the ground.<br>3: The guy pointing is just looking up and pointing in the general direction of the bird<br>4: the acting is award winning <br>5: no snake lifted by a bird will serpentine like that, they would normally curl up and try to wrap around the leg and go for a bite.<br>6: the snake on the ground is all blurry and &quot;soft&quot; looking- usually done in CGI to blend in with the imperfection of film/video<br><br>7: the bird lifting the snake is flapping it&#39;s wings and changing direction without altering its wing flaps. Think of it this way, you sprint in a straight line differently than running around a cones. What this CGI animation is suggesting is you sprinting and having the same footwork while running around a 90 degree turn. lol <br><br>Again, the award winning acting and timing is just great... Bravo  lol.. ahh cringe.
Yep, very fake
fake
Fake
Fake
Pff, not even scary
The last part was fake as fuck
Demonetize. It hurt my feelings.
Even if it is fake you gotta admit it at least fooled you guys a bit.
fake
super fake!
Hawk was like &quot;hey cook this me&quot;.
amazingly fake.
Based on my extensive research in the comments section, I can conclude that the theory of the snake being &quot;fake&quot; is 100% true.
FAKE
It&#39;s fake, BUTS IT REAL FUNNY XD
I think what you people are trying say is that it&#39;s FAKE AND GAY.
fake but cool
what the actual fuck animals are now purging against mankind
Darn that heckin squiggly tube dude
Thats illegal !! Its a violation to city code sec 7-1.1 lol !!

always funny &quot;Foreign speaking, freaking out and running away with some wildlife chasing them&quot; I got a chuckle although its a fake as you can make it
Hahahahahahahahaha
that&#39;s cg is this one of those cg fool us competition
Such a majestic creature. They&#39;ve been terrorising this precinct of Melbourne since 1961...particularly during the spring time. It&#39;s quite a frightening sight when they swarm and attack. They have been known to devour all sorts of creatures, such as swans, eagles, dogs and even kangaroos. Most notably, cats will become paralysed with fear as soon as they see a hawk, which makes them easy pickings. Experts believe that the constant presence of these mighty birds is the main reason why so many frightened felines seem to go missing every September.
听到说我们的中国话
Australia is the place to commit suicide. :)
Hawk n Snake : ITS JUST A PRANK BRO!!
CGI is the new funny and ridiculous
lool
I heard that this snake flew to Australia just to catch a Kangaskhan but only found more fucking Ekans.
FAKE
If we&#39;re going back to 2012 we might as well do it right. Fake and gay
He didn&#39;t choose the thug life...
Why does everyone have to be sherlock holmes about this? Why cant we just a have a fun interesting video where a hawk dropped a snake mid flight? Everything unexpected and rare isn&#39;t fake.
they do this with rabbits aswell. they swoop down pick them up then drop them on a road or hard surface. they repeat this untill it&#39;s dead. ive had them snatch fish from my hands. I&#39;ve seen them pick up snakes and drop them onto the outback highways right in front of my truck. bigger ones take small wallabies and joeys.
Fake! Snakes don&#39;t move like that, and anyways, it&#39;s moving faster than the frame rate of the background
That Friendly Hawk was just trying to be nice, giving them a free feeeeed maabaaa
People are explaining how to tell it&#39;s fake in complicated ways. Here&#39;s how you tell it&#39;s fake: why would someone start filming a hawk flying around normally?
MURICA to the rescue!!!!!!!
Typical Australia.
lmfao
FAKE!
False and homosexual
He was just sharing
I&#39;m sorry it fake
Well those accents aren&#39;t Aussie

Maybe it just wanted someone to barbie the snake
konichiwa!!!
😅😅😅😂😂😂
Australia&#39;s solution to Chinese tourists.
how sweet it wanted to make sure they had enough food
fake not because it&#39;s edited , because what hawk would give away a tasty snake like that ?
Even if this is edited it look like something from harry potter or something
there&#39;s no reflection of the hawk on the water.
Dude had to add in a snake so it wasn&#39;t so embarrassing for him to be afraid of the bird. lol
Fake gay snake
fake and gay
I am going there before I die!!! I have friends there and always wanted to go there!!!
They forgot to throw on the sh1tty pixelated filter .
Fake
And that&#39;s y I don&#39;t support Hawks lol
Hawk: Just a prank bro
This is why we have the internet
When you see your ex in public😂😂😂

That&#39;s how the Mexican flag came to be
I&#39;m so happy fake animal videos are still a thing. They are super entertaining to watch.

Captain disillusion we need you!
Clearly the Hawk is a talented chef and wants to trow in the snake as an appetizer for an exquisite delight to any Asian palette!
× It doesn&#39;t tilt or flap its wings, but can somehow soar and turn?<br>× Picks up nothing, see nothings, and at the last turn in, the snake is visible and as large as the hawk.<br>× Hawk decides to keep spinning with the snake because it isn&#39;t hungry?<br>× video cuts short just like the eagle that picks up kid, or cobra that a girl snatches out of the air as it charged.
Gake and Fay
lmaoooo this is o damn fake
