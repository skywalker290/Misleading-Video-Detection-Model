Came here to watch this scene after watching Sara Ali khans hello sanjay video 😂😂

Race mein Saif looks older brother to Akshaye and in this Akshaye looks older brother to Saif. <br>Akshaye as an evil elder brother in Race.<br>Akshaye as a supporting friend in DCH.<br>But different roles to one character, Saif.

What a classic! Every shot with Saif in this movie is hilarious. 😅
What message netflix wants to spread? Is &quot;Be a man &quot;to control girls as per man&#39;s order? Do they care anything about this?
