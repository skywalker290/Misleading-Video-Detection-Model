Conor McGregor is a true champion mentality and physically.......🏆 👏
This was before he got them dollars.
After this fight. <br>He started taking drugs. Drinking like crazy . And stopped traning mma <br>And started traning Boxing <br>You cant win an Mma fight with just boxing
6 años despues
Just let them fight right now. They&#39;ll both pass out lol.
Conor was a straight up cold blooded killer, he was legitimately scary at 145.
Ist the best megregor
Looks here like Conor has some sort of illness...
🦮
Jose aldo fim de sua carreira
Se eu tivesse oportunidade de enfrentar esse ruivo eu não me abaixava pra olha pra cara dele.o resultado era outro.

الحمد لله رب العالمين الرحمان الرحيم مالك يوم الدين اياك نعبد واياك نستعين....Why not enter Islam. Just study this religion and find the true word of God is not distorted. It was revealed by the angels who serve God. In the book, the Qur’an, he gave me many stories about the Apostles and the Prophets .. My dear brother. My advice is that if you want to win life and choose you, you must enter Islam and prayer. Zakat and fasting Ramadan, and if you are afraid of your religion, know that when you enter Islam, God will open all doors for you, meaning livelihood, money, and people’s love for you from your morals and ethics. He is the Muslims and God&#39;s religion has become the religion of Islam God has established laws for this religion and these For hath are very useful for humans as Hnaak miracles of minor and major among the younger women become worn dress indecent and see people in the construction and slander.And the great sunrise from its setting, the exit of the cistern, the exit of Yajuj and Magog is an endless army that exits from the bottom of the earth, the exit of Isa bin Mary and the Antichrist.

conor at 145 looked like ruble at 170
jose aldo was scaer
so lets say people fight at like 137 lbs instead of the 135, is that really an advantage in a skilled fight?

Hey americans. you can do the shows better than all!
feel for the guy. he got himself goaded into playing another mans game,  and as they say the house always wins. should have stuck to his own flavor and let his opponent do the reaching
I like how the ole and the background music sound good together

And mcgregor knocked him CLEAN OUT!!
Sim essa luta já passou e infelizmente José Aldo perdeu, mas eu sinceramente achei uma grande falta de respeito do publico ter aplaudido o McGregor e vaiado o JOSÉ ALDO, porque esse McGregor se acha, não tem caráter e muito menos humildade, acha que pode humilhar as pessoas e principalmente o país do oponente, se achando o rei do mundo.<br>Já o JOSÉ ALDO é um exemplo de lutador, que levou na esportiva e não o ofendeu em momento algum, foi humilde e principalmente respeitador.
McGregor taking his clothes off was longer then the fight.
Shame the fight never lasted this long.
Look at Dana tryna block conor&#39;s feint kicks with his knees haha
Até aí eu ainda acreditava!!!
lol, that&#39;s hilarious McGregor reaction...
words of non fighters I see. Mcregor would punish each of you. respect has been earned. be men and respect it. fuckin bums
I&#39;m missing the point of the girls in their bras standing in the back.

o cara mais otario que o conor mcgregor nunca tinha visto
&quot;When one of us goes to war we all go to war&quot; THAT&#39;S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE IRISH!!! TRUST ME WE&#39;RE ALL BEHIND CONOR AS AN ENTIRE COUNTRY...
He&#39;s hard!
love the fact when it says connor vs aldo full fight and the duration is 30 seconds !! lol!!!!!!!!
back round song anyone?
Whats the song playing throughout????
José Aldo muito melhor os very good
conor p mim é um babaca
why i don&#39;t care anymore about boxing? because is not real, you can have runners and &quot;hugers&quot; as mayweather winning everything and the juries a lot of times are very biased, being for money, local pressure, etc. With UFC none of that is possible, everything is real and fighters knows that they better prepare and give everything because no running, hugging or refereeing will save them. They also know that if they win, the juries won&#39;t let them down with unfair decisions.
2x4+25/5 seconds
old guard v new guard
whats that song
Why is everyone surrounding them fat and bald ? xD funny contrast
conor always backs up what he said<br>this guy is already a legend
lol lorenzo making sure connor doesn&#39;t fall off the stage
Aldo looked waaayy better in the weigh-ins than in the fight, he probably didn&#39;t sleep lol
Essa gracinha só deu pro rabinho do apanhAldo. kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
ДОпонтовался Альдо, вывод, не умеешь понтоватся, не понтись=))
It&#39;s really fun to re-read the comments from all the idiots that thinks Conor is afraid of him or that thinks Conor will get knocked out! hahaha... Just some numbers for you guys! 13 sec
What happened Aldo fans
ready for the rematch!he won by flunky lick!#team aldo
Aldo should have respected Connors talent...next is frankie..who respects mcgreggor... Connor will have more fun with that &#39;veteran&#39;.... Buahahahaha

Funny reading comments from aldo fans from before the fight. Mcgregor all day bitches
If somebody tells me name of the background music/song, that will be great. Thanks.
Ridiculo UFC é uma armação
and the rest is HISTORY
Who is the Clown now!!?? :)
Is Dana loling with nerves or the thought of all the money?
I experienced enormous force in there :O
why Aldo did not use that approach against Conor in the fight is baffling,,I was thinking cool Conor didnt get to Aldo mentally ...how wrong I was ,,instead he charges at conor like an upset child out in the schoolyard..something Aldo never does,,that fight was over before it began..whoever can get into Conors head ,mock him ,make fun of him ,and well placed liver kick will beat him,,,,Conors a cancer ,,their very sensitive people,,bump this when he loses
we fekin du et wi stile fekya green day yank hang on cunts look up blu Irish
Aldo looked so relaxed after he got knocked out!
awe aldo looks so cute here doesnt he. Almsot as cute as when he took his little baby nap
people were like conor got clowned but truth of tge matter is that this was out of character for jose. you could see that he was nervous and scared in the past staredowns so this time he didnt want an actual staredoen. conor just reacted by towering over him but jose got what he wanted which was not yo lock eyes with mcgregor.
More action than the fight lol
poor aldo all that work and he lasted 13 secs lol
Mr White separating them at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EGhtia_Pmk&amp;t=139">2:19</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EGhtia_Pmk&amp;t=150">2:30</a> literally makes me lol. Like either of them is going to throw an actual punch or kick pre-fight. Maybe it&#39;s happened before, but I find this ridiculous. Almost as bad as &quot;pro&quot;- wrestling. <br>Whatever it takes to sell tickets. <br>(Just IMO).
lmfao connor made aldo look like a fucken fool so many times and aldo does one stupid little thing to try n show that he is not scared idk if any of you watched the fight but i was ablee to feel aldos fear as soon and he entered the the arena he looked like he was going to get everything taken away from him not only his title but he got his confidence ruined mcgreggor will whoop everyone is style
knock out  quick fight
sao os melhores ainda
anyone know the name of the girl in the red, Hot Dam!
aldo got knocked the fuck out
went here after watching that 13sec epic KO
hahahaha aldo slept in the ring in just 13 seconds :3
haha dana is the referee

Does that Irish guy smoke crack or something?
Notice the cheering for mcgregor and the booing for Aldo
aldo put up a better fight at the weigh in than he did in the match lol
I believe it will be one amazing fight and after<br>they will shake hands.<br>they both know they are the best in their weight.
Brock Lesnar will eat them alive both at the same time
vai manaus

All the Aldo fans got real quiet.
Exactly as i Predicted Aldo Out Cold...... Perfect punch and Footwork!!!<br><br>1st Round K.O ..<br><br>.Also ,I Just Won Over a thousand Dollars ...Betting on rockhold and Mcgregor...Thanks UFC !!!

Where are all the youtube body language experts now?
13 seconds to win....gwahhhnnnn the Irish
Aldo&#39;s body language says it all!!.......he was beaten before he started....well 13seconds to be precise!!
Can&#39;t WAIT to hear the excuses from McGregorhaterfucknuggets!!! Let&#39;s see what options you&#39;ll choose from...perhaps something along the lines of A)Aldo only had 8 months training camp for this fight... B) Aldo&#39;s rib is still sore C)Conor&#39;s opponents are handpicked, he still hasn&#39;t fought a Shaolin Monk.....  Fuck all the haters, give him the credit he finally deserves and stop living in denial.

Best of all... Aldo called it not a real fight. LOL
ahahahahaha... all ya haters can suck it~ a brilliant 13 seconds... lmao
And then Conor won.
Being an Irishman, I&#39;m not a fan of Conor McGregor&#39;s unprofessional mudslinging, insults, and childish put-downs of his opponents(psychology and mind-games or not), but the man can certainly put them away with power, skill, and style. He should just let that talent do the talking in the Octagon. It&#39;s certainly what he&#39;s best at!
who won the match
WHAT ABOUT CONOR KO&#39;s ALDO at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EGhtia_Pmk&amp;t=4">0:04</a> of the 1 ROUND? thanks to conor for extra 100$)))
Early stoppage
All aldo&#39;s fan is trying to hide right now. HHAHAHAHAHA
Conor knocks out Aldo in 13 seconds hahahahahah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13 seconds
13 secs
omg that was one lucky punch from conor
fixed ... fixed ... fixed
DAMN THAT WAS A QUICK MATCH!
well done Conor bro. paddy power
where is aldo&#39;s fan right now??
It will be done in one. How you think and so it shall be well done Conor.
I love both athletes, I think McGregor will dominate in this fight, but Aldo seems relax.. Let&#39;s see what happens this much anticipated fight UFC 194..
One punch lmao
who won
if only someone can tell me the soundtrack being played
McGregor will dispatch Aldo pretty quick. that&#39;s the way Dana wants it. grow up people its we like garbage!
Look at the cheek bones protruding through McGregor&#39;s face. He&#39;s lost too much weight and looks like a malnourished 100 day famine. Aldo looks much more comfortable and apt to this weight. Aldo will destroy Conor for sure. He&#39;s very composed even in the manner of taking off his clothes in an orderly fashion. Conor is a show-off hype taking off his clothes like a mad man in response to the crowds chants. Aldo looks more focused and determined. It&#39;ll be a bad year for McGregor. The rpide and mouth will get shut down once and for all and Dana White will lose two of his biggest hyped up money-makers. Gold! And while I&#39;m at it, I hope someone bitchslaps Joe Rogan and that would make a great 2015!
CRAB FIGHT!
come fight time, mcgregor will be just about comfortably back to his natural weight (middle) :-)   aaaaaaand still............
hahahahahahhahahahahahha
BR BR BR HUE
aldo is imitating conor style..
Wowww man i m excited..feels like wrestlemania moments i experienced 12 years ago
cade os br ?
Reading through the comments I am apparently NOT alone in my feeling that Conor McEgo is more than a little full of himself.
I think after aldo reported that he couldn&#39;t fight Mc Gregor, he took time to compose himself aswell as study Mc Gregor&#39;s fight againts Mendez. Mc Gregor has the tools to beat Aldo maybe in stand up, but with w/ the media obligation and coaching Ultimate fighter might have taken less of his concentration. I had the fight for Mc gregor before Aldo&#39;s injury, but I think its now 50/50 or even advantage for Aldo.. Peace..
the José Aldo is very good
Это бой века!!!!!!!!
Aldo took Conor concentration it only weighing hope Jose Aldo makes a spectacular fight and take a appear that !! ALDO breaks !!
anyone got a live stream of the fight?
lets see how many people jump off the bandwagon tonight
This fight will be more even then people think.....José experience conor fearlessness can&#39;t wait I bet who ever wins everyone will be saying &quot;told ya&quot;
It&#39;s funny how peoole over analyze the weigh in as if they can tell who&#39;s going to win the fight off this alone LOL. Conor will knock him out in the third
Love Conor, he&#39;s my favorite fighter but he needs to move up in weight. He doesnt look healthy.
José is the king...pega ele José, mostra quem é o rei e quem o bobo.
The midget will be squashed by The King...Conor wins in two....
Lmao! Dana got scared when he saw Conor&#39;s leg go up! xD
bota pra fuder aldooo
If Conor maintains good range as in previous fights he&#39;ll take Aldo no problems maybe in 3rd round  ? But Aldo only gotta land a solid leg kick to Conor&#39;s previous damaged leg and reduce mobility it could be over ,
Real fights with fake shows
Jose gets even on the shoulder grab ahahah
mano adoro ver essas encarada, pqp hahahahaha
Ronda McGregor!!
McGregor is getting KOed Dec 12
the winner will be facing Jon Jones
Dayum ! When conor was standing sideways, I almost mistook him for wrought iron ! But the white socks gave him up.
Conor looks like a straight killer😎 I feel sorry for Aldo.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23goaldo">#GOALDO</a>
Mcgregor looks really drained. Aldo Lois considerable at that weight
I love Joe Rogain.
надеюсь конор будет в форме к бою.страшно выглядет его сгонка веса
Aldo u moron has never been tested positive for roids.
conor gunna burry that ass
when does it start? in 1 hour? someone link me to a proper live stream plz.<br>thx
I think Conor is going to destroy Aldo.
$1500 on Aldo..just bet it last night here in Vegas.cant wait..
this is the fight of the year
Aldo doing what Champs do, staying focused. Connor is an excellent fighter whom does have the weapons to possibly bring it home. However, his temperament could get the best of him this time. 2 goes in and 1 comes out the winner. I&#39;m rooting for Aldo. Somebody gotta support the Champ. Enjoy the fight fans! Peace!
I&#39;m a McGregor fan but Aldo got the better of him by mimicking McGregors stance. Coner did not like it. Every other time Coner has got the better of Aldo.
lol at Dana tryna block Conor&#39;s kick with his knee haha
when they fight?... today?
name song? plz
Esse galeguinho , vai levar um Paulo da porra.
why does the ufc manager have a t-shirt over a pullover? lol
the girl in red is so hot
This is the first time I&#39;m not nervous that Conor McGregor is gonna lose
New to UFC. what&#39;s the point of a weigh in when the fighters can go back and try and pack on the pounds before the fight?
ALDO WINS!!!
The irish should be ashamed of  mcgregor, if they have dignity
I&#39;ve been waiting for this thing is finally here yes
Aldo win McGregor looks drained second round knockout bets on
Aldo by 2nd round TKO
conor will win like he said he would he hasn&#39;t been wrong yet so shut the f**k up all you haters
Notice how hypocritical the people in the comments are. Before the weigh in, on the press conferences and the embedded vids, they were all like &quot;Conor is in Aldos head&quot; &quot;Aldo looks nervous bla bla&quot; etc. but now they see that Aldo is as calm as it gets and everyone changes their minds Lol fuck outta here.. I still tink its a 50-50 fight.
i can wait for tonight, Aldo wins by nock out on the first very round. the clown is already on the past. connor can apologize before the fight,But tha beat up is on him already, i can see that.
conor watched vikings too much...
)))
Connor doesn&#39;t look at him? What video are you watching?! To me Aldo looks worried on the scales.
Lol none of you have the mental toughness and drive to cut weight or do anything like that. Couch potatoes wirh jokes
Omg aldo is gona get wasted so bad, Conor&#39;s got height, serious spring and is way too explosive for Aldo, can see Aldo getting a wake up call in the first few seconds, can&#39;t wait!!!!! How much hours now?
conor&#39;s weight cut looks like he shouldn&#39;t be in this division.  he cut all that weight not to fight someone his size.  then he brags how a little man can&#39;t hurt him.
Like they say don&#39;t hate the player,  hate the game
Yeah u guys know alot lmao! mcgregor is ready and you all will see tonight aldo will go down haters
it will be done in 1
when aldo wins. thats it conner will never in his whole life do what he has been doing to aldo. no UFC fighter jas disrepected aldo, the way conner has. conner need to sort himself out.
Joe Rogan 5&#39;6?
Dude mcgregor looks like a stick
AND HERE WE GO!!!
кто это?
who won someone please?
gonna be a good one
sO crazy what they have to do to make weight,  Gregory obviously looks dehydrated and hungry... Aldo looks beast... Can&#39;t wait!!!!!!
I thing, it&#39;s game...<br>Excuse me for my english.
Emelianenko forever
Conor is in way over his head
what a difference the body of jose and the body of coner coner gone get prepared for a slauterfest he is gonna take to the semetery zend an ambulance please and enough surcurity for those irish fans they can brawl if aldo kils him!gr carlito from holland
Aldo é foda! Tinha que ser manauara!
conor is so confident, u can see it in his eyes
How many more hours? Ugh. <br><br>Wolf Tickets. Aldo wins easy
haha now mcgregor looks scared Shaouu
Are there  vids on mcgregor&#39;s and aldo&#39;s interviews after this?
Connor will beat the fuck out of Aldo, just wait on it!! Couple more hours till aldo gets his first loss in 10 years...
Go Jose Aldo !
could you rogan be any weirder duing these staredowns.
is it me or did the samething happend on holmes vs rousey? holm touched rosey, rousey acted tough said some bitchy stuff then got knocked out lol and now jose touched conor conor posed like hes gonna kick then talk some stuff haha.<br>well see later the result. if conor gets KO&#39;d hes gonna join ronda on the MEME campaign lol.. great fight tho few more hours to go ..
crabs)))
mcgregor covering up his tense with his confused moves. aldo on the other hand is very stable. aldo fears no one, the eyes tell a lot. mcgregor fan.
The 2 fat Americans couldnt make weight..
Mcgregor wins. I know this for a fact. It&#39;s not a guess. I know.
vai aldo
jose got this one
Aldos first fight in 18 months... cant wait to see this one
love it when he screams on top of the podium with eyes staring at the crowd and his arms up. its like he is getting ready to lead his army to war! wow!
HALF-DEAD CONNOR IS GOING TO HAVE YOURS THIN LEGS CRUSHED.. UH VAI MORRER!!!!!!
to all the bitches in the comments, Conor will butcher your boy jose and change the game.
q dia e q horas vai passar a luta?
I&#39;m concerned about Connors speed, although Aldo won&#39;t expose his biggest weakness which is wrestling.  Aldo can&#39;t get hit flush by Conors left hand or it&#39;s over
This is harder to bet money on than May vs Pac.
Ha, ha, McGregor looked scared. He&#39;s going to take a beating.
Connor looks drawn out . He looks scarred . Aldo on the other hand looks great, and he&#39;s relaxed . Hmmm..
I love how Aldo trolled him so hard lol
Альдо заряжен. У Конора мало шансов...
dana white is paid in full. ....
Aldo looks JACKED
Aldo wins !!!
Does anyone know where I can watch his online for free?
What time is this on at and what channel?
jose Aldo na veia McGregor si prepara para guerra
What the song?
mcnugget is gonna get his ass whipped
Totally unprofessional. This is not a real sport. Why table tennis players don&#39;t behave like this two.<br><br>I&#39;m writing this as huge MMA fan.
aqui e BR porra huehuehuehuehuehue uh vai morrer!!!!!! bora aldo
which track is playing in the background?
I love Connor think he was done more for the sport than Aldo has done in ten years but looking at him in these weight ins isn&#39;t good at all. I can&#39;t see why he does it 145 is definitely not his weight to be fights looks wrong and weak if I&#39;m honest
Jose will probably break his arm falling in the shower or something ..... fight wont happen boys.
Aldo will always be the greatest at 145...when connor has done over ten years as ufc champ then he will be the greatest.and trust me he won&#39;t do it...I give him 5 fights from today, someone will KO him..so win or lose ALdo is the greatest at 145
Conor lost so much weight
Good luck tonight Conor boy.
Haha! What a great joke from Aldo:) Conor was confused.
So many idiots commenting in here. You want to make some money? Conor on 3rd round
Gosh I feel like somebody could die this match ug !!!
EEWWWWWW WEEEEEEE THIS IS GUNNA BE GOOD... I CAN&#39;T WAIT ..
McGregor looks nervous here
lmao...Connor&#39;s face looks like a crackhead. He was mentaly way different from the Connor we saw before. Unexpected attitude from Aldo...If the weigh in was a competition Aldo would have won by unanimous decision and today will win by knockout! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23andstill">#ANDSTILL</a>
😂😉😉😂😂😂😂
Conor looks hollow, nervous, agitated, Aldo gonna win.
Zé Aldo tu é demais...<br>Por favor enfia a mão na cara desse idiota por nós !<br>PS: os que não conhecem a nossa língua que traduzam...
THE HYPE IS REALLLLLLLLLLL
Conor McMcGregor looks like Christian Bale character on &quot;The Fighter&quot; movie.
Conor is weak during a weigh in... almost everybody know that especialy Aldo
aldo acts like a true champ...Brazillians dont act tuff,  they are tuff...
Aldo got Connor this time with the trolling
aldo 2 win ko first round
é jose aldo porra detona esse palhaço
Болею за Альдоооооооо😈💪💪💪💪
Aldo is so scared of mcgregor
conor doesn&#39;t look healthy at all.
Conor please win this fight and then move up to the 155 division, the weight cut won&#39;t be as dramatic for you. Conor is a big guy for the 145 division, his walk around weight is 170 lbs.
It seemed to me , or Jose pushed him with love... like the love with his bitch:)
conor seriously should be fighting up division up , he cuts way to much weight.. he looks like a crackhead , so tall has to be so slim to make weight..
Seriously he looks ILL
Connor looks like a sick Josh Barnett
Connor looks like fresh out of a concentration camp.
I`m in Conor team. He is not better fighter then Aldo (in my eyes they are equals), he is not nice but he will fight more often then once on evry 2 years.
Joe looking chubby as fuck!
молодцы шоу делают, на ура 🙌
omg becky
All stand-up. Should be excellent for a few minutes.
Aldo might use his palms in this fight...
Aldo looks good,but not good enough.
Conor Mcgregor aka Chris Bale The Machinist
Mc Gregor   Vai  Toma Um Pau  esse  Otário...
what were the people chanting?? they must have thought it was a football match between Ireland and Brazil
i have aldo by decision
go conor! !!! aldo is so stronge. .. But conor is god!!! Will see
Lool aldo still scared, look at him trying to do something now he&#39;s had 6 months now he comes out with this ? Lol just like Conor&#39;s last fight with Chad, Chad had to clap his hands to get himself ready Conor&#39;s been killing him from day 1, game over Jose .
who would boo at the reigning champion? even if your sympathy is with the opponent, that´s just respectless. After all, this is still martial arts, not nascar
McGregor looks very tense. Aldo looks relaxed. Don&#39;t know much about about fighting but I can tell that Aldo is more confident he&#39;s going to beat McGregor.
bouth  look like  comes from concentration  camp. ...lol
lol....I wish  mcgregor win  ...but he look  so  skiny. ..better for  him  to move  up  in  weigth
aldo is going to knock the shamrock out of him!!!!
All You Aldo Fans Are Gunna Be Shocked Toomorrow.....Or Do All  The Betting agencies of the World Have It Wrong? ...<br><br>McGregor is the Favourite For A Reason...<br><br>Aldo&#39;s Leg Kicks Wont Work on conor His Footwork Is To Good and He&#39;s a southpaw, Every Leg Kick Will Be answered with a Counter Head or Body Punch...,<br><br> BJJ won&#39;t Work Either.... conor Is Just too Good at Defending takedowns and BJJ.<br><br>Aldo is Not as Good a Wrestler as Mendes is .... aldo&#39;s Flat footed rely&#39;s on That Soccer Kick to much.<br><br>Just Watch Diego Brandao&#39;s fight with Conor ...He&#39;s Brazillian With a Very Similar Style To Aldo .....TKO Punches Round 1 ...Just 4mins for conor to Beat Him.<br><br>Aldo Vs Mendes 5 Rounds = Decision<br><br>Conor Vs Mendes 2 rounds = Mendes K.Oed<br><br>Conor Vs Aldo = 1st Round K.O..... And NEW!!!
Jose Aldo best fighter
that conor guy, his easy to piss off; emotional bitch.
什么时候开打啊？？
aldo looks more then ready wow.. this is gona be a good fight
conor ripped like hell !! Aldo nice homework  but , gonna get his ass kicked
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk foi engraçado
This is dana the entire time $.$
Today Aldo had some Lucky Charms cereals for breakfast. At night, he will dine on some McChicken!
Rousey believed all the hype about her and mcgreggor believes his own hype.....<br>Both will suffer the same fate at the hands of a real champ....
aldo was hiding behind Dana the whole time
so when is fight and time
Альдо красавчик, классно прогнал с Конора
Mendez Le Puso Una Verguiza Al Gregor Nomas Porke Se Canzo Perdio Pero Aldo Es Mas Perro I Lo Va Nokear A La Verga Pake Se Ensene A Respetar , 1,000 billetes de one hundred  Asegurados Aldo
aldo looks fit II
what is conor gonna do to the p4p #1 again? i forgot pls remind me??????????????????
patriko???? sanju singh????????? where are u???????????????????????????????
where the fuck are the mcgreogr fans at? i thought he was gonna rip aldos head off???????????
Can&#39;t wait to see Dana&#39;s face when Aldo knocks this clown out !!!!!!
Aldo wins by KO. This fight will make Aldo over the top the most well-known MMA fighter ever!
Man, I hope another one of Dana White&#39;s puppets loses! Plus I&#39;m getting tired of these immediate rematches
Ээээбаут
Notice how Aldo lowered himself before connor..subconsciously submitting himself already...
best weight in ever
WTF!!! Conor looks like a skeleton! Look at his face, jaw and neck, every single bone and ligament is clearly protruding from his face! He looks soooo dehydrated, and this is not a good sign for him at all!
I beat the FUCK out of Conor McGregor in High School!!
Conor is definitely in Jose&#39;s head.  The better move is to just stand there ice cold like Holly Holm.
Notice aldo lowering before connor.... Subconsciously he has already submitted himself
you guys realize he won&#39;t look like that tomorrow at the fight. you have to be a certain wait at the weigh ins. after that you could be 991 pounds. it wouldn&#39;t matter. so in the fight he won&#39;t be looking like that. he will look like his normal self
Well all you guys making fun of Conor.. you have obviously never had to cut weight before. your all fat kids who play COD
Aldo&#39;s gonna stomp him hard
затролил , лалку , Макгрегор всосет
альдо красавчик ))))
The hype is over, and so is Mcgregors dream
McGregor looks Waaaaaayyy to thin. Needs to get out of this division. Should be a great fight.
Lmfao.  Mcdouche was chirped fuckin hard.
Connor had a boner !!! He kept adjusting it .
Go Aldo!! show em !
I&#39;m excited
Aldo is one of my favorite fighters and I think he is a better fighter than Conner overall. But I have a bad feeling about this fight for him. Aldo has been out for a year and Conner is riding this wave of momentum lately. That plus Conner is bigger, more legthy and a great striker in his own right. Aldo doesn&#39;t have the takedown pedigree to bring the fight to the ground like Chad or Frankie can. Conner isn&#39;t going to attempt a takedown so Aldo&#39;s takedown defense is moot.
as much as i Love connor.. i think this will be another rousey fight. I hope he will beat jose.. but it just takes one punch.
I would like to see aldo kick those show girls hahahahah
aldo tried the low stance and conor sets him up for a high kick lol<br>it didnt land cuz dana pushed conor back
conor looks so drained I thought it was an impostor
Yes iam afraid...but Aldo won&#39;t be able to do that when big white ain&#39;t there to protect him
Yes iam afraid...but Aldo won&#39;t be able to do that when big white ain&#39;t there to protect him
LETS GO ALDO
lol looks like aldo got the last laugh here. can&#39;t wait to see who comes out on top tomorrow
Aldo vai acaba com esse  mané aiii José Aldo estamos com VC  guerreiro
this will be a better fight then mayweather vs pacquiao ill bet my car on that!!
Aldo and Chad both think it&#39;s a game
I&#39;ve never wanted to see a fight this bad, my heart was beating so hard at the weighins. Best of luck to all the fighters. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ufc194">#UFC194</a>
Did Aldo slapped Mcgregor??
aldo all the way !!
Conor McGregor owned the fight promotion. Jose Aldo will own Conor McGregor.
Haaaaaaa! Bitch Made Conor is nervous
This doesn´t look good for Connor, at all...
Sou de Manaus e o Jose Aldo vai ganhar, só chute na perna
mind games, Aldo knows McGregor is scared of him
Copying Conor! lol McGregor is in his head pmsl Aldo thinks he is Conor loooooooollllsssss
McGregor using Aldo&#39;s head as a speed bag tomorrow night. Irish K.O.
This is gonna be a good fight.
if mcgregor loses, and even worse, gets knocked out. his credibility is out the window.
Jose Aldo looks in form ,  &amp; we never seen a pissed off Aldo fight before.<br><br>Conor pushed him  too far...<br><br>let&#39;s see if Conor can take a few kicks.<br><br>kicks hurt more than punches people.  the pain is instant  but don&#39;t take my word for it.<br><br>if Aldo gets in 3 kicks,  all of Conors movement will fly out the window.
...Aldo is going to roll through this fool.
McGregor was like tha fuck do I do now
Gostei, Aldo deu uma boa zoada no joker e ele tremeu.
Jose looks like he has Conor out of his head now. Should be interesting with both guys psychologically even
fuckin dana and his hip trushts rofl
Esse tal mcgrego vai toma no cu de tanto orgulho
Guys I live in Europe and I am looking forward to this match for over a month could someone please link me to a live streaming???
dana almost pushed conor over just holding him bck.
Yeaaah Jose
Vaaaai Tooooomaaaaar um courooooo.
Cant believe Jose actually made weight, its hard to get out of the fight after that, this might actually happen
damn, two corpses on stage. weight cutting is nasty.
The weigh ins need to be moved to just before the fight! These 2 look a mess! Stop this insane weight cutting that cant be doing the fighters any good and get better fights!
why does conor always try and kick people at the weigh-ins lol
Aldo is a Savage.
Conor looking very Auschwitzy
LOOOOOOOOOOL Aldo trolled McGregor BIIIIIIGGGGG time
Lets get it on! The time for talk is over! 
The cagegirls got wet after that
Mendes tried pulling the same approach to Conor and we all know how that ended
Funny how Aldo fans say he trolled Conor but every single one of em know he flinched when Conor threw a knee up. We&#39;ll see what happens when they clash tomorrow night..should be interesting.
José Aldo War.
jose aldo won the weigh-ins all 5rds we can all go home now aldo ls stll the goat
What&#39;s the song in the background?
Aldo&#39;s going to TKO this goofball into a sob story montage with &quot;On My Own Alone&quot; playing in the background.
Two desiccated men square off....
McGregor seems my neighbor floyd he use crystal in mother&#39;s trailer
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EGhtia_Pmk&amp;t=147">2:27</a> Dana with that Michael jackson Block LOL
Conor smokes Meth to cut weight... but you didn&#39;t hear that from me.
Dana was so pissed at Aldo for not letting Conor own this moment
We&#39;ll see Conor walking out of the octagon with gold around his waist in a beautiful sight once again. Come on Conor.
👊💥👊💥👊💥👊💥👊💥👊
Ha ha Aldo makes Conman nervous and it will be an easy victory for the champ.
McGregor has no answer for Aldo&#39;s ground game and leg attacks.
Mcgregor looks jacked up on the juice
Please.  Conor, TKO round 2.
Funny but totally out of character for Aldo, Conor is in his head.
Oh boy ! eh eh
WAR ALDO OSS!!
They both look like stick figures
Conor McGregor looks like a skeleton, and then tomorrow he&#39;s going to weigh 170 pounds again lol.
Is it me or does Conor look way more drained then usual. He must of had a hard weight cut
The irish stick figure is in for a beating.
Conor looks like Vincent Van Gogh&#39;s corpse.
they thirsty !
Goosebumps!I really love this sport!
McNuggets got Butthurt....LMAO
McClown McGregor looks like a meth addict
when its fight?
lmao Conor&#39;s hyped up tough guy moment ruined by a trolling Brazilian.
Jose &quot;troll&quot; Aldo
CONMAN LOOKS WEAK LIKE HONDA! MCASSHOLE HAS CRACKED HE WILL LOSE BY KO

Tomorrow is the beginning of the new era. McGregor shall destroy Jose Aldo in devastating fashion and be the undisputed fw champion of the world.
This will be even funnier when Jose gets knocked out in the first round.
Aldo does not looked as jacked as he has done before.
Aldo is a funny guy hahah nobody expected this.
Round 1 to HOZAY!!
