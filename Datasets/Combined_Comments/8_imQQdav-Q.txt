He did a flat near where I live 2 days ago üòÆ
Wards cant commit spray paint artist like they can to all the others
Banksy dont want to be a chalk ward like madsaki made it out
Bansky was the first guy getting off. Or it‚Äôs a group of men.
Fake garbage, report this.
Fake
Those people were fake
just because someone uses stencils to make fancy little doodles does not mean that its banksy lol...literally saw a story about some stenciler guy in my country in some small no name city being arrested... guess there&#39;s a banksy in each country now.
Fake AF.
Why would u follow him or them ? Clown! One day u gonna get punched for doing that ! Nobody likes anyone running up on them when they are doing art/graffiti‚ÄºÔ∏è
Why dose he look like Eminem though
Banksy is a group
It must be a Suburban-people thing to think it‚Äôs safe to approach hooded strangers in a dark alley, literally no self-awareness.
I met him, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s him. Good job on the short film with friends though.
now afer 1,5 million views, can you finally please take that shit down and get a life yourself?
fake
Lol now that we know who he is if you compare the face this really is him the nose is a dead give away
It&#39;s definitely banksy.  I&#39;ve played the lost interview and matched his voice with this one.  Banksy is Robin Gunningham and there is already pictures leaked from 2008 from a BBC documentary and has resurfaced since somebody has taken banksy to court over personal matters. His identity was matched by an forsenic team investigation. They taken fingerprints and other evidence and matched it with Banksy. <br><br>Note Bank&#39;s glasses and thin Frame. It&#39;s exactly Cunninghams. <br><br>Look at the leaked picture
if I‚Äôm ever dying prematurely of some deadly disease the only thing I‚Äôd ask for is to see Banksy in person. I wouldn‚Äôt reveal any pictures to anybody because I‚Äôd be dead. That, and I wanna wear my 1985 Jordan 1 Chicagos at my funeral.
Banksy is not one person. and this video is fake (becouse those two guys )
That definitely wasn&#39;t scripted üòÇ
It‚Äôs Sam Hyde
That&#39;s kevinüéâ
Highly doubt that is Banksy and stop recording people doing shit in hosier lane. Can&#39;t even paint there anymore because people keep recording and taking photos of me without permission
Why the fuck would you try to get his face on camera..so disrespectful..
Fake
Team Robbo!!<br>Fck banksy!!!!
fake
ahh yes run at 3 taggers very smart decision
i think banks is one person but he‚Äôs got multiple people helping him with his work so if he‚Äôs caught they won‚Äôt know which ones the real one like this there was 3 other people and banksy could have give them the stencil and paint it‚Äôs actually smart also he‚Äôs not dumb enough to go out in public spray painting with out some face cover like a balaclava or something
Was it wasn&#39;t it lol
Why are people making this like a  dream chase but when he reveals it looks nothing like him
Fake
King Robbo only
Doesn‚Äôt banksy just do stencils everywhere ? When I was younger I use to think he would create it then and there now I know why robo came at him RIP to the legend
Lucky he didn‚Äôt spray your face
I swear that&#39;s Jamie Hewlett
Leave ppl who wanna stay hidden alone u jackass
The fact that you have no common sense. He‚Äôs a graffiti artist it‚Äôs obvious he doesn‚Äôt want to get recorded if he wants to get recorded with his face why did he go anonymous all this time? Woman you are on some weird shit
This is the man who got KING ROBBO killed. This is the man who ripped off blek le rat. This little shit needs a bedtime. If you were so righteous, why don&#39;t you take off your mask and show us all who u really are!
This is the man who got KING ROBBO killed. This is the man who ripped off blek le rat. This little shit needs a bedtime. If you were so righteous, why don&#39;t you take off your mask!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

That&#39;s not cool, why running behind like a stupid ass bitch? He is who he is because of his anonymity
He is actually a Vandal...  A criminal.
That isnt Banksy! He NEVER signs his art ever thats a fact
I can hear her sigh. Maybe dont run up to him and yell at him just cuz he famous
its him!
Personally I don‚Äôt think Banksy is a person, rather a collective masquerading as a single individual but even so, if this was ‚ÄúBanksy‚Äù why would you record? Better yet, why would you upload it? Years on and I bet this is still the most disrespectful thing you could have ever done, uppercut yourself
Kind of looks like him. <br>Theres a video of him doing an interview in 2003 with his face covered but you can see his eyes
I think his face matches with Robin Gunningham&#39;s
if this is real you are an absolute piece of shit.
Fake
banksy is a retard<br>he destroyed the most iconic graffiti piece in england
???
Definitely fake and not him‚Ä¶ üòÇ
Idk if it‚Äôs real, the guy in the video does match the description of banks wearing glasses, but idk. It‚Äôs a common feature
Where was that??
Banksy doesn&#39;t sign his work.
He does &#39;tag&#39; some of his stuff .. and this person does look like Robert del Naja  (one of the considered &#39;contenders&#39;) [??? !!!]
if i were him a good punch in the mouth would be appropriate in my opinion
bruh this isnt him hahaha
So he&#39;s a dorky white guy from England?<br>We all knew that tbh
Fuck sake the poor guy was just trying to take a shite!
I don‚Äôt think anyone would believe me if I say that my 30 year old brother gave banksy his name
Of the four suspected people who are accused of being Banksy - Neil Buchanon, Robert del Naja, Billy Gannon and Robin Cunningham - only del Naja comes the closest to looking like this guy in the video. Only problem is del Naja has a slightly longer nose.<br><br>If this is the real Banksy then there simply isn&#39;t enough evidence in the video to prove it either way. If this is Banksy then it is a new face no one&#39;s seen before perhaps.<br><br>Most likely this is a phony attempt to get likes. Plus what&#39;s with the two lookouts being caught off guard? You kidding me! And why would anyone in their right mind want to do that to Banksy?<br><br>I hope Banksy is NEVER found out. I hope when he passes on he takes it to the grave. Oh and by the way, that is not a Banksy on the wall.
bro why would you do that
Not his hand
This is so staged or you‚Äôre actually stupid I would‚Äôve sprayed your face and ruined your eyes immediately lol üòÇ self defense in an alleyway üéâ
youre disgusting girl
Holy shit it‚Äôs Marc Maron
Why cant people leave the guy alone and not run up to him and shove a camera in his face for personal gain
Banksy is far from a genius more like. Murder and toy
Idgaf what y‚Äôall say I need a fucking face reveal fuck y‚Äôall mystery.
Banksy is not a person, it&#39;s a movement.
Fuck of we are Fools. It could be, that this Video is part of the Art of Banksy. Yes everybody is a Faggot, who wants to know who he is
Bad
One can only hope he slapped the living shit out of them. So respectless running after him like that.
You for real have nothing better to do then fake finding Banksy? That&#39;s some weird shit.
Conveniently arrived just as he finished? Hmmm I call fake.
So fake. This is just a friend trying to pose as Banksy, so that they could get many views. Big giveaways are the fact that the guy has no paint and that the painting happens to be exactly ready when they come storming. And why they come storming, how do they know that this is Banksy from so far away in the dark, you cannot see the painting. So how on earth they knew it? Unless they knew there was an already painted Banksy from a few dats/weeks before. Nice stunt, but way too many flaws to make it look convinceable.
He should of hit you square in the nose and broke it
Oh yes this Video is propably 100% right this propably is banks Omfg shut the fuck up even if it was Banksy what kinda bitch u gotta be trying to get his Face on cam if he gets revealed he gonna Face a bunch of million Dollar charges that would ruin his/their life what ever whoever banksy are the fact she is trying to catch him is pathetic as fuck and I think this shit was planned and not even fresh sprayed/painted so anyways that was/is a real good Sign saying hey Look Im stupid I Post before I think great work Women thats the spirit...
In 1980 I began to paint a graffiti legend in my country. He was a friend of mine, he died in 97, and when he painted nobody knew him. Era: Muelle.
F A K E
this is illegal lol
Stupid woman trying to chase a man in a dark alley way. What if he stabbed you!
Why the bitch tryna reveal who he is someone slap that hoe
banksi a bitch fr, stencil ass mf, king robbo ups ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Banksy is a fake he‚Äôs not with the people he‚Äôs totally with the system
The woman works for him, so do the others.
Banksy with a European accent loool
So it&#39;s a woman then..
Banksy CLEARLY wants to remain anonymous. Why dont you respect that you pathetic fuknut? I hope someone leaks your medical records online. Oh? Those were supposed to be private?? Ohhhh? Yeah turnabout is fair you dillweed.
Banksy swore that if his identity is ever outed, he&#39;ll stop making art. Idiot Karens like this would destroy the art he literally gives away for their 15 minutes of fame. Congrats you get to be the asshat who ended Banksy.
yeah this video is fake
He&#39;s pretty young looking for a Banksy tbh
There are certain things i can be certain about and still not comment on. Just because, I don‚Äôt feel the necessity. I doesn‚Äôt help.<br>This is a weird moment, now I know it won‚Äôt help to say what I want to say, but I‚Äôll say it anyways.<br><br>That is not banksy üòä
How fake do you want it to be? <br><br>yes
so stupid
We dont want to know who he is and its probably a group of people.
Banksy is shitt
You can just google his face lol there like 3 pic of him on Google image or one of the associate of him
That looks like Hosier lane Melbourne
And first idea was to chase him to unmask him...what a bunch of morons...like people breaking on the highway to better see the carnage of the accident on the other side
Faker than something something
Fake, fake and more fake.
You&#39;re a jerk.  Plain and simple.
Zzzzz
Robert Del Naja
People can be really disrespectful and mean ! They would do whatever it takes to get what they want regardless of the consequences! I would&#39;ve smack their faces .......
As much as I know people want to find out who he is, you are exactly the kind of person I hate. This is the most invasive thing to run after a person like that. I think it&#39;s good Banksy is a mystery, I also understand why he wants to stay that way.
Banksy is one person. He&#39;s my husband... He regularly runs these guess who I am stunts in the papers. He&#39;s not a known name. He is here in Reading...
Yeah that looked kind of staged.
That&#39;s definitely Robert Del Naja from Massive Attack LOL compare his nose shape to a picture of Robert and he has the same long, thin nose and a buddy of the British band named Goldie, has been interviewed about art in the weekly podcast Distraction Pieces blabbed. In one sentence he was still talking about Banksy, in the other he called him by name: Robert. <br><br>However since he was running away with what appeared to be two other guys i&#39;m gonna say they were either friends of his or the two other Massive Attack band members, they had to of been Adrian Thaw and Grantly Marshall, although the guy running closely behind seemed smaller so the guy on the right must be at least be Grantlly because he&#39;s tall, while Adrian seems more average height at 5&quot;8 or 5&quot;9, if the guy running behind isn&#39;t Adrian then it&#39;s somebody else.  <br><br>However they seemed to be more observing and maybe there to keep him safe, so i think it really is just Robert doing it, unless they come up with ideas together and then Robert spray paints it lol, their website is looking very Banksy style right now and care a lot more about the climate issues than others currently do. Many pictures have shown up on destroyed buildings in Ukraine too and Robert has been creating art pieces to raise money for them. It&#39;s totally at least Robert Del Naja it&#39;s obvious.
well.. its not art. its stencils. big fucking deal. its not revolutionary, or visionary.
Ha. Sooooo fake. Bad acting lol
Would it be Respect to them to take a picture of the art and immediately destroy it
What a trash fake video
Ugh...
He stole all his ideas
üôà
Fake
that isint banksy banks is like 40 years old
Banksy is a government propaganda operation, not a single artist, to promote communist ideals through visual communication. Tied into the same groups as BLM, Antifa, and that other communist propaganda plant Shepard Fairey. They are utilizing street art style to influence and radicalize this generation of youth.
You are just retard on camera, just this!
Fake
Oh yea one think ya all ain&#39;t know it is a pseudonym and btw why u stalking people hm.... if he won&#39;t talk with u u don&#39;t need to force it. Or should we stalk ya girls
Great way to get views, loser
Fake.
Damn, you guys were so close to get the rarest pokemon in the world, yall gotta get a better poke ball fr.
Fake
TOY
copycat.
Me gets cuaght : about to get my butter fly knife ready
if he was really Banksy, then this implies that he has trained escaping people for years
Bnaksy is like Ditto pokemon.
hahahha banyak peniru
LONG LIVE KING ROBBO, BANKSY&#39;S A PRETENTIOUS WALKER üòÅ
thats fake.
why would you try run after hima nd ruin the illusion
If banksy did not exist. King robbo would still be here.
You run up on someone graff writing in a laneway like that in Sydney, good chance your getting stabbed
That‚Äôs definitely not Banksy because that‚Äôs definitely not a Banksy piece.
Everyone knows banksy has a long nose, wears glasses and sometimes has long-ish hair, I believe this was him for sure
The only way knowing who banksy is by not turning on the camera and watch him do his masterpiece
Fake also gay
what a little bitch ass coward. that woman has more balks than that little glasses wearing twerp
fake af lol
for one thing banksy would be smarter than to turn around
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamrobbo">#teamrobbo</a>
Well we do know banksy is white. However with scanning and digital. Who cannot be banksy? I still prefer to think it‚Äôs one bloke. If he still does it good for him. If not. He‚Äôs created a huge genre for future artists.
Banksy hasn&#39;t signed his artwork in years
No way thats  him üò≠üò≠üòπüòπ
Bit young to be Banksey lol
Dude. Fuck you not cool to run after him and trying to film him. And it‚Äôs probably not even banksy he gets other people to do it for him.
Pure fake shit üòÉüòÉüòÉ
BRO I KNOW WHERE THIS IS I WENT HERE BEFORE NO WAY
&quot;yuppies feiern banksy aber streichen unsre taggs. Ihr haltet euch f√ºr fancy ich halte euch f√ºr wack&quot; ~ DR. DMG
If banksy was one person how is he going round the world so fast doing paintings  come on guys use your brain
Lol üòÜ
I wish people would stop trying to hunt him down, just let the dude make art and live his life in peace like he wants smh
B
Thats not banksy and this is shit
You should never run up on a graffiti artist like that it‚Äôs just not what you do just give them a simple ‚Äúlove the work man‚Äù
Yo soy banksy jajajajajaja soy de Guadalajara, es f√°cil un come üçÜüçÜüçÜ con una cartulina cortada son su nombre jajaja
This is the most inapropriate behaviour that you could show to a graffiti writer / street aret dude. Just because of you someone could get in big trouble
üß¢
ok i stand near a banksy pretend i am painting + get my girl to film it <br>then when she comes after me i cover my face tell her f off then run away <br>FAKE AS F -  i have not read comments yet but please dont let me see that anyone has even fallen for this .. ffs <br>also banksy aint got no italian accent üòÇüòÇ wtf
Who has the audacity to run up on someone like that? At this point in his career, nobody wants to know who he is anymore. That&#39;s part of the legend
Hey Banksy....if you&#39;re watching this...please come to Madagascar...
so fake it&#39;s cringy. The way the POV camera looks at his name then runs toward random calling Banksy, feels like it&#39;s a shit video game cutscene. <br>people believe anything in 2016
i started dying when she chased him xD
Maybe Banksy is not one person
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs Banksy sorry

If you guys see a graffiti writer painting, do not approach. We will either hurt you or run off, there‚Äôs a lot of risks from cops to territorial gang members, we don‚Äôt do this for an audience
Not to be rude or anything but u cant be going around yelling peoples graffiti names like that; thats how they get caught. So if u wanna keep seeing his art then don‚Äôt do that to him or other artist. Even banksy himself said to go away, so pls just be genuine about those types of things. And try ur best to maintain a distance that doesn‚Äôt escalate suspicion
the amount of dislikes lmao
1:no, this isn&#39;t Banksy he looks a lot older than this guy he looks 20 and 2. they probably just found his art and pretended to be him.
Lol some rude shit to do to someone
lil nerd. mf aint even a street artist
2 reasons that wasn&#39;t banksy<br><br>1. He uses stencils, that guy wasn&#39;t using stencils.<br><br>2. Banksy doesn&#39;t sign his works. If he did, that&#39;s the wrong signature, clearly a fake.<br><br>If you&#39;re going to do this, at least make it look legit.
Not him at all, just a fake to make many views.
not cool bro
i live in the same city he grew up in
RAT
He literally has a group of at least 50 people that make his work, he just make the art and they paste it on walls.
Now this is a long but it‚Äôs. Worth it trust me!! I drove My daughter and her husband back to her house in Hastings about 2aM one morning, I parked up behind a white a van and we spent abt an he talking in the car‚Ä¶ about 3am when there was not a soul about 4 to 5 men with pulled up dark hoodies and head torches suddenly got out of the van infront of us went to the rear of the van opened the doors and all started loading themselves with large lidded plastic buckets And about 4/5 art tubes then all headed off down the beach which (we were parked opposite the pier in Hastings‚Ä¶ the next day Banksy let the world know he painted another masterpiece!! Also on the main a259 just before the Marina there was an owl and a mouse that were painted singularly and opposite each each but the council painted them over quite quickly.
ok
Banksy a toy idk why people give him so much credit when he literally just paints over a stencilüíÄü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
it‚Äôs not him he always puts tarps up
f u mia s respect
don&#39;t quit your day job. acting definitely isn&#39;t in anyone&#39;s future, in this video lmao
Fake
The fact he‚Äôs miraculously placed art in some of the most open and public places somehow without ever being spotted doing it or ever arrested makes it hard to believe he would walk down an alley in a street full of people and get caught in the act.. 100% fake
You have 0 respect to the artist
maybe dont yell HEY! HEY! and he wont be so afraid
Banksy is like a trick question to see if someone knows about current art. These comments prove that people dont get it still. Sad but awesome.
Fuck banksy robbo is king
It‚Äôs not on his website so it‚Äôs fake
Fake
I seen better acting in porn.
Bro let him live, why pursue him, let him make art
Zzzzzzzz Zzzzzzzzz Zzzzzzzzzzzz
You literally assaulted him, if it was the opposite round you&#39;d be hated, I am a victim of being harassed by girls for being aroace.
Why don&#39;t you leave him alone?<br>Of course, I know you&#39;re curious about him. <br>But I hope you don&#39;t mess with him to keep him art
OMG LUCKY
FFFFAAAAKKKKEEEEE
Is that really him?
Banksy has confirmed this isn&#39;t him üòÇ
Haha you didn‚Äôt meet him ü§° if anything your trash for trying to expose him even tho this lameO fake vid
I love your mother
He probably tried to graffiti over a Banksy artwork, then got caught, said fuck off, then ran away!
your such a bitch give him some privacy
i once saw him on venice beach selling a paiting i saw it thought some jackass was selling fake art didnt buy it regret it ever sense i saw his video in venice beach
WHY THEY HAVE AMERICAN ACCENTS
Banksy is <br>Brad<br>Ant<br>Nick<br>Kevin<br>Simon<br>Yoseph

What a toy
Sure it was him.....
Yea let me just chase a person and when the keep walking try to grab him
Is it just me or does he look like. A fcking forty year old doing these pieces of art
Im not quiet sure if this woman knows  anything about banksy or what he has done in his past that would lead him to going to federal prison. She almost just ended this mans whole career.
You shouldn‚Äôt have done this daaniya f he doesn‚Äôt what himself to be seen keep it that way
More staged then your mom&#39;s marriage
Leave him alone
You lot are cunts for that just leave him why chasing him like the dog you are
Fakeee<br> üòÜ
dont ever do this again to another artist
Fake the way he reacted on camera was to cringey
Oh yes lol banksy hey! Lmao at 3am
Banksy&#39;s art is lame and mediocre
What will you do with his face, focus on pieces
Oh hey let me chase down banksy
snitch
I hope every banksy out there has a terrible day.
Wow. Even if it was real. What kind of snitchy lil toy would run up on him with a camera. Beside I still believe BANKSY is a movement, not a person
Who chases random people down an ally, weirdos ü§£
This is prob fake but I still want to say this do NOT approach famous graffiti artists cuz that is SOOOOO stupid they are just trying to mind there own business doing graffiti
Banksy ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ ŒôŒ¥Œ≠Œ±...<br>ŒìŒπŒ±œÑŒØ ŒΩŒ± œÑŒøŒΩ Œ∫œÖŒΩŒ∑Œ≥Œ¨œÇ ŒºŒµ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ∫Œ¨ŒºŒµœÅŒ±, œåœÑŒ±ŒΩ Œ¥ŒµŒΩ œÑŒø ŒµœÄŒπŒ∏œÖŒºŒµŒØ ... üòïüò¢üíî
ROBIN GUNNINGHAM
You didn&#39;t meet Banksy... Banksy doesn&#39;t tag his own shit. He isn&#39;t that vain.
It‚Äôs respectful if you wants to keep anonymous he‚Äôll keep anonymous but if he doesn‚Äôt then he would not be anonymous the fact that you chased him after he ran away establishing that he was uncomfortable with you filming him it‚Äôs just very disrespectful
Hes an anti semite and anti israel bigot
Banksy is really a 45 year old geologist.
Yeah he doesn‚Äôt sign his work
This channel was created the same day he/she uploaded it. Sus shit
First of of just on appearance that&#39;s not a Banksy stencl. Second of all he wouldn&#39;t make fun of another country (Australia)  and as an Australian, &quot;FUCK OF WHERE FULL&quot;  was a very racist think Australians would say to immigrants about 12 years ago..  so yea Na mate NICE CLICK BAIT, NO BANKY
hahahahaa... catch him if you can ;-P
That‚Äôs not Banksy !!! Banksy is a white dude !!!! Used to hang about with my crew in woolwich dockyard graffiti hall of fame back in 86 long before he became who we know today !!! Cant say anymore
Banksy isnt a man, he is an ideology.
he didnt seem happy to meet u lol next time just shut up and walk home
So fake my brothers
Respect the anonymity of the artist working illegally in the streets. Or call the police if you think spraying things Is a crime. But don‚Äòt publish shit like thisü§¨ü§¨ü§Øü§Ø
banksy sucks <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kingrobbo">#kingrobbo</a>
No you didn‚Äôt
Fucking Banksy and his stupid artwork
Fake and gay
this is the worst skit ever lmao
Banksy is lame
Did you use masterball??
nah... that looks super basic, more like a copycat. bansky stencil placement is a art in itself
I am banksy
I don‚Äôt want to know who he is, for me it would ruin the entire message he‚Äôs sending. A message most people either don‚Äôt get, or don‚Äôt care to
3 things. 1. Reall street heads know the movie he dropped before he was famous and why he does what he does  2. Trust me that was not close to him. 3. He has a team of 8-12 people at a time looking out for him due to his stance on how badly he is wanted. This would never happen. He as well does not sign his work not for a whilllleeeeeeeee. Also the team around him is on point so they would of never ran but your phone would of been taken and wiped if needed.
Good acting
Lol this isn&#39;t banksy this is staged
i hope everyone knows this is fake...
Bruh y&#39;all rude as hell for chasing him like that just let him be
That&#39;s not the real banksy
Damn, that almost looks like a &quot;real Banksy&quot;.. said no one ever
faksy
He seems to have said &quot;casse toi&quot; , in French, meaning &quot;get away &quot;..
I dont like banksi
Haha nono this dudes name is goodguyboris he just a Graffiti troll
lol cant believe people think this is real
i dont think this is banksy, and if it was why the fuck would you run towards him respect his privacy god damn.
The real Banksy don&#39;t sign his work...
In the depths we do not speak for our normal lives we must keep.
For all we know the real banksy could be dead and these people carry his tradition
Either it is Banksy, or not.
I&#39;m willing to bet Banksy started being a group in the 2000s, because he obviously started off as one person,
I just finished uploading a story about Banksy&#39;s Girl with Balloon selling at Auction and I stumbled across this video. <br>it MAY be Banksy, but what woman in her right mind, walks down a dark ally were there are 3 strange men dressed all in dark clothes and approaches them. <br>That must be one really safe area, no risk of being attacked at all.
if yall run up to an artist like that yall weird asf fr frrü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Banksy doesn&#39;t autograph
leave him alone. stop seeking after fame or something u dont understand. just stop..
This vid is obs fake lol
fake
Seems like some sort of a faked video
Hipster girls: *likes a banksy photo on Instagram<br>A mob of Taggers: Kick em in the groin!
If you show the world who banksy is there is a chance that he will have to stop doing art because police now know who he is
Faker thn Kim kardashians chest
Prob fake ngl
My nan is banksy
Everybody just doesn&#39;t even consider that &#39;HE&#39; may be a &#39;SHE&#39;.<br>My nan is actually Banksy
:o WOW
I think the saddest  thing about Banksy is he&#39;s convinced the world he an original stree artist when infact he&#39;s a rip off hack copying other artists work and passing it off as his own and that its somehow interesting and original when it&#39;s very basic and one dimensional .
Plot twist:the guy was just taking a Wizz and thought you were cops and probably was high lol
just a Toy tried to copy banksy...
fake banksy
Cap they just found one of it and get a person to act like they just painted it all cap üß¢
This is fake, Banksy wouldn&#39;t be throwing up a piece without having his face covered and hidden. This was a clever click bait.
oh yes this is bansky.^^
Really stop banksy would not stop and you would not know he was there or his crew . It‚Äôs a crew
Nice art tho
i mean. he doesnt want to be found
wow your acting was so bad this dog would get an Oscar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub82Xb1C8os">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub82Xb1C8os</a>
I just wanna see if he does vids on his Graffiti
If I were banksy in that moment I probably would of told her to F**k off üòÇ
Why are you touching him
fake news, RIP KING ROBBO
Stop trying to find him, his art and privacy should be respected. If he doesn&#39;t want his face knows then so be it
That&#39;s not real asl banksey always has his caravan behind him whilst painting
Total bullshit set up! All of those graffiti writers are around 40 now. This was clearly a lad
i&#39;ve seen banksy and this is not him
I can smell the soy from here.
Banksy&#39;s  biggest success is fooling the so called art world &amp; any one else who buys into the theft of some else&#39;s  idea&#39;s.....to quote Banksy himself: Every time I think I&#39;ve painted something slightly original, I find out that Blek Le Rat has done it as well. Only twenty years earlier&quot;. This quote itself is a lie as Banksy has studied in detail every thing Blek has ever done....Banksy le fraud.
Hey y‚Äôall why is Banksy all the sudden American?
Best that his identity is kept secret
≈•—õ»äùïä »äùïä n≈å≈• ‡∂∏ ùöã‡∂∏nKùïäŒ•
Banksy is a smart artist im telling you they would never make an art work in a cruised place y‚Äôall should think and not okay almond like dumbasses
Keep up the painting

Fake as this Scam-demic! üò∑
Why
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fake but that picture is a spitting image of my god mother who took her own life by walking in front of a train.  I don&#39;t know where they got the idea for the picture but it&#39;s her
fake sound dunch
Bullshit
How cool would it be to get Banksy to come to Newark NJ
Nice but that‚Äôs not him
He probably has people who help him
Hello
U know that&#39;s a crack head not banksy üòÇ
Stupid bitch
Even if that was Banksy.. why would you reveal his identity? What kind of trash are you to do some shit like that? Are you that pathetic and desperate for attention? &quot; Oh look at me... I caught someone on video..&quot;  I swear some human life isn&#39;t worth a damn. You wanna bust someone out do it the government, or a bank, or corporation. smh  wtf
Why do people complain if it was filmed vertically what is the problem?
Prankski!
I mean in a old documentary about the banksy robbo beef, robbo did say that he met him once and he slapped the glasses off his face and this man had glasses on. could be fake but non the less crazy af if you caught this man in action.
Bruh moment
Bro that is not Banksy cause if she saw banksy she would record it earlier and when she started to record he finished,what √† clincidence
Wow, you&#39;re so lucky that he&#39;d just finished his name or we wouldn&#39;t know it was him (sarcasm).
Why the name mia
He should have a mask it would be much cooler
Hahahahhaha<br>Cause imma believe dat
My friend got a promotion at work<br>Pretty sure he is ranksy
Fake
So wtf did you put it online for then?
I don‚Äôt wanna sound bad but did he say f*ck off? I thought I heard that muffled as he covered his face
faker
Fejk
Caught him JUST as he&#39;d finished and signed his name - Wow what a coincidence that you were filming right at that time too.<br>Idiots!
I&#39;m sorry not him, he used a stencil and Banksy doesn&#39;t
How could she tell it was him from about 30 yards away? She couldn‚Äôt see the graffiti so how the hell did she know?
Dude I saw this guy wearing all white and he had a long beard I think Jesus lives right by me...
Soooooo fake ,you can  do spot better than that,Please,
the paint on the name was dry üòÇ if he had just finished painting his name it would be wetüòÇ
it&#39;s made by a small sfx company: <a href="https://riotcontent.com/virals1#/1-million-views/">https://riotcontent.com/virals1#/1-million-views/</a>
HOW DARE YOU TO GET HIS FACE!
Banksy wouldn‚Äôt have turned around.
We can all sit here and mug of the guy for the fake prank but he‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs got 1million fellow idiots to watch it! So hats of to him for the fakest video on you tube (gold digger pranks not included!) and getting 1 million twats to watch and comment on it making his pockets heavy whilst we all discuss what a wanker he is!
be careful doing this shit, fake or not, other writers would have take your phone and smashed it on the ground, u will deserve it
Compared to other videos of Banksy....  looks like him!! Skinny with glasses..... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z19cvtrIoU">https://youtu.be/-z19cvtrIoU</a>
Pranksy
Pretty amateurish acting, premise, etc. Nice try though. Do it properly and you&#39;d have easily beat 10mill views by now
Fake
Fakest shit Ive ever seen
Fake
I think everyone can see that it&#39;s fake
My friends Mum dated banksy
I heard 0 rattling cans doesnt look all that new, fingerless gloves no faster way to cover his face? Mans a little more professional then that
Fake
its bullshit.  youre a phony and just a liar.... for what?  youtube views?  get a life
Banksy could be anyone this includes those perpetrators or fakes as well.pls remember this.
But report this vid pls
That picture was his styles of painting
Fake as faaaak! Like the two by-stands would allow her to approach like that and film it then run off with him later?! Think about it. Or better yet that &#39;hollywood&#39; turn-around with lighting and that &#39;magic trick at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_imQQdav-Q&amp;t=30">0:30</a>sec....looks all like a person with intellegence of a 2nd grade kid did all that. Pitty. All it did created a tasteless locomotion around the legend.
Met?? U bumped into him and he murmured f**k offüòÇ
It is Robert Gunningham
u piece of shit
FAKE!!! xD
Damn if he doesn&#39;t want to be seen then leave him alone damn.
bitch no you didnt
Fucking fool fuck you doing this? What a difference to you who he is, let him remain incognito. You run after him, it&#39;s good that he did not give you a knife in the liver, or you would have deserved it.
Banksy doesn&#39;t tag his art, cause he doesn&#39;t want people cutting it out &amp; selling it off for millions. Fake video
signature is different than his usual oneü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Even though it&#39;s fake, I think Banksy being a mystery makes him/her mysterious and special. Bansky being from England (where I live) just makes it even more special because I know we have an amazing person among us ((: Banksy will show himself/herself when he/she wants to, so I recommend not trying to find him/her, because if he/she would have wanted to be public, he/she would have showed themselves already. Drop it already people :p be respectful of people&#39;s decisions. (:
Banksy is from Bristol, this guy is from london
fake
You can see that the painting isn&#39;t actually part of the wall...
fake as fuck
hey I am in Italy and it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_imQQdav-Q&amp;t=180">3:00</a>am and like one of my friends shouted &quot;he is found again on camera&quot; ... BANKCY.... I don&#39;t think I spelled him wrong
wow some one else got him on camera I did not post it
Bitch Please!
gake and fey.
So fake
its not banksy if it was banksy he wouldrnt of turnt plus he wouldent do it in an ally way and why would she have her camera?its obviously a crap skit!
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23woah">#woah</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wow">#wow</a>
this guy looks like he is twenty
That&#39;s not him that&#39;s Ben Eine a.k.a my dad
Nah I think this one is real looks like him.
Get this down man
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_imQQdav-Q&amp;t=31">0:31</a>
fake
Just sayin&#39; this here, if that actually in some universe is him, then that would be an enormously disrespectful thing to do. Not only is it because his art should be the center piece, not him; but also because he guy has been responsible for easily hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in property damage in numerous countries, he has also broken into restricted areas and literally everything about what he does is illegal. If you really were a fan of Banksy, or any street artists like that, then you&#39;d leave them the fuck alone, otherwise you run the risk of sending your &quot;favorite artist&quot; to prison.<br>Again, just sayin&#39;.
FAKE!!!!!!!!!
banksy is sam hyde confirmed
I have seen photos of him from as far back as 2003. In the studio, out in public. This isn&#39;t him.
fake
fake
That&#39;s false, does not believe even a child would have to break your legs by lying, I would be embarrassed to take advantage of the person
Even if it was Banksy, Why would you try to expose him like that?
its fake
What people do to get viral these days...
Impossible, Banksy is more older that that dude
he us my neighbour
No you didn&#39;t
Dosent banksy have a british accent? fake.
Hahaha!  You fools, Bansky was in Bristol when you claimed to have filmed this!
Fake as fuck! <br>You stand by that banksy graffiti and I&#39;ll come up with a camera then you run and we&#39;ll get loads of views on YouTube... nice try üòÇ
fucking rude bitch
why the fuck were you trying to chase him
fake but viral
Yeah . . . that&#39;s not me.
Idiot girl, even if thats him, why the fuck would you expose him?
DADDY SUGG
It&#39;s most likely that company that is making fake viral Youtube videos as an experiment. They made the flying snake one and the Shark in sydney harbor.
No!! I am Banksy!!
Divs.
Who&#39;s banksy
BULLSHIT!
much fake m8
Nope. No you didnt.
FUCK BANKSY!!
who is banksy????
So OK... lots of people are saying that this is fake. <br>Set up? Who knows.... but can anyone actually say <b>WHY</b> its fake, or are you all just sheep following what the last person in the comments section has to say? <br>Its ok to say something is a fake, but if you can&#39;t give a reason as to why, then I won&#39;t believe you. &quot;Because it&#39;s fake&quot; is not a reason..
Wtf IS banks
fake as Wayne Rooneys hair
Who the fuck is banksy?
That clearly wasn&#39;t Banksy. It was clearly the resurrected Jesus.
fake
Banish doesn&#39;t sign his work. Great research.
Fake as fuck
Fake.
&quot;glad it&#39;s fake&quot;<br>&quot;don&#39;t worry it&#39;s a fake&quot;<br><br>&#39;cause there was someone who could worry about? lol
banksy is asian
He should be a lot older than that
By the way this can be seen as legal , she could say it was clickbait and she could of just said she was recording the alleyways with a homeless man in one of them. Saying homeless won&#39;t annoy you guys because half of the comments think that it is fake...
How can he keep up the dab for that long...       <br><br><br>Sorry .<br><br><br>I dipped my phone into a bowl of dank memes....
Fake/20
Fake?
fake as fuck
why is he so popular
He wouldn&#39;t turn around and look at the camera would he that&#39;s stupid and he probably wheres amask too in case something like this happened
Why is there a lot of dislikes?
free advertising for the Melbourne art show... smart creating a hype!
faker than my ex
2 sins.<br><br>1. Vertical recording<br>2. Banksy is dead
Banksy? more like fakesy

its LUSH
Lol the description &quot;Cant believe I just met Banksy!&quot; no you didnt love, you annoyed him. Bloody american although its probs fake af
It&#39;s in Melbourne, Australia. Melbourne accent. Banksy&#39;s done a tonne of pieces here, the city is actually trying to protect his artwork. No one is saying this is in Bristol. I know this alley well. Here&#39;s the location:<br><br><a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Hosier+Ln,+Melbourne+VIC+3000/@-37.8164126,144.9669085,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6ad642b6521c6a15:0xa92699044c913e0f!8m2!3d-37.8164126!4d144.9690972">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Hosier+Ln,+Melbourne+VIC+3000/@-37.8164126,144.9669085,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6ad642b6521c6a15:0xa92699044c913e0f!8m2!3d-37.8164126!4d144.9690972</a>

Delete this
Who the fuck is Banksy
What the f*ck is this?!
Joins YouTube the day she uploads...
fake
you fucking prat thats Gary 2 Toes from Oldham. Banksy my hole. move along nothing to see here.
Publicity stunt for the Melbourne Banksy show
There&#39;s an &quot;artist&quot; at my school who draws dicks on walls and signs underneath them wanksy and you&#39;ll never guess who it is
Mia S Why you always lyin. Seriously if that was the real banksy as soon as he hears his name he would haul ass. And he wouldn&#39;t say &quot;fuck off&quot;
He doesn&#39;t tag his work like that anymore, so I think this is bullshit. He only added &#39;Banksy&#39; to his earlier pieces. No need to tag it when everyone recognises his style. And you can tell that it&#39;s a second-rate Banksy imitation.
Who&#39;s banskey
Everyone report this
bad girl, leave him alone
saw some meme earlier. reckon its name was danksy.
Good try but if it was him he wouldn&#39;t of turned around to face the camera. Good try on boosting your subs..
bullshit
Banksy...the hardest Pokemon to catch!
whether that was or wasn&#39;t him, for gods sake just respect his privacy !
Ball
:-B
Why was &#39;banksy&#39; dabbing
why sorry but why is this getting viral the amazing thing about banksy is that he has never been caught.
wtf dude, way to ruin his image
love his reaction
Who&#39;s banksy
Basksy is british
WHO The hell is banksy
Hey Guys , Banksy here . Just wanted to clarify the guy in the video is not me and i request Mia to please delete this video .. Thanks
So you walk home from work via Hosier Lane late at night. If you get attacked now, don&#39;t play the victim. Should be more careful posting such information.
banksy doesnt put his signature on his work
The guy is smiling when she records &quot;banksy&#39;s &quot; face
Fake and gay
Thx this person is what I&#39;m learning about good channel two and thx for getting close to his face
<a href="https://discord.gg/sbZJY">https://discord.gg/sbZJY</a>
Well if it isn&#39;t Banksy he should let everyone know because if he swears and hits his fans he does not deserve to be rich from them. If it is a fake it could be libelous. Not so funny then I guess.
And when does he ever sign his stuff? Fake as fuck.
not fake at all lol
The description says &quot; can&#39;t believe I met banksy &quot; well not really she did meet supposedly met him then chased him down a street while trying to expose his face. Perfect just Perfect
haha! this is SO bad in every way, the acting was terrible. at least use someone who looks at least 40+ now.
Who is banksy?
clickbanksy
Some things are meant to be left a mystery!
Banksy&#39;s from Somerset.. How was his accent close at all...?
Why. Why ruin it
Nah. That ain&#39;t him.
Who is filming vertically???
Banksy is well known as a street artist and no o e knows his face apart from the people close to him . Leave him to it . Soon he will show his face to revile his true identity and plus this is so fake hahahahhaha
Oh my fucking god
who is bantsky
Fake.
Hiding face or dabbing?
Nop
Who&#39;s banksey
When will people learn to put the phone on its side when they film! üò¥
this vid is not fake at all...
1 banksy is not American, 2 he doesn&#39;t hang around after his art work 3) it&#39;s probably just a guy looking at the art and he ran cause the girl is running at him
description &quot;can&#39;t believe I just met banksy&quot;... yeah and the viewers don&#39;t believe it either love...
You didn&#39;t catch him, he told you to fuck off! cool story bro
Pardon my ignorance but who is...
The thing is, Banksy is anonymous so this is is probably heavily fake given the fact that he&#39;s so anonymous and no body really knows who he is so we can&#39;t confirm or deny.
Too easy to fake
Wait no, I think that&#39;s my dad . Ben Eine
Nice try but that&#39;s not him
He is my godfather why are you trying to expose him take it down !
Delete this now !
lol 8000+ thumbs down. teehee, i added mine. teehee.
whoopee, fucking, doo. u saw an over rated grafitti &quot;artist&quot;. he isn&#39;t even the first to do this kind of shit, he nicked the idea off a female he knew. ipso facto fatty.
That&#39;s not Banksy I&#39;m Banksy
Fake and gay
Really, where?!
delete it
No he isn&#39;t he is my godfather and I would appreciate it if you could take this video down now ! üòÅüôè I&#39;m not Evan joking
FAKE, he doesn&#39;t tag. he just posts it on his the site, and this isn&#39;t on there. plus he wouldn&#39;t turn around.
No I caught Banksy a year ago he&#39;s tied up in my shed
wow that s breathtaking
Fuck sake you really think he goes out and risk being caught doing his own street work... no course not
He doesn&#39;t wear glasses
If this is real it&#39;s fucking bang out of order are you too thick too appreciate his intelligence without chasing him down the street? Just leave him alone...
who the fuck is Bansky

this is fake
Banksy doesn&#39;t sign his work...
The can he shook didn&#39;t even rattle and banks uses stencils
So fake
Bulshi
What has no one ever seen banksy&#39;s face or something? wtf&#39;s the deal?
This aint banksy. Too much over spray on the shitty stencil
I&#39;m sorry lool but believe me that ain&#39;t banksy.
Who the fuck is banksy
Pauline Hanson is the subject matter, she is a outright racist, and yes she&#39;s a ranga.
the guy wants to be anonymous don&#39;t destroy his long hard work of staying anonymous, your lucky he didn&#39;t kock u out
Wow at least make an effort guys
fake asf. banksy has never been caught so there&#39;s no chance he ever would. even if it is him, delete it, its disrespectful
fake. why would he turn around and risk his face being exposed to the camera. a person in that position would continue running or facing the opposite direction.
I just caught banksy on camera! more like Banksey saw a monster
fake
who is banksy
Gr8 b8 m9-1 glad to know its f8k
Fake.
Give the man some privacy for fuck sake
stop trying to out him, you arse.
Who&#39;s bansky? Why r u chasing him?
Fake
Obviously this is fucking fake
This is just horrible <br><br>Some people want to remain unknown such as banksy or even sia just let them live there lives
who&#39;s banksy and what is this video about?
Why was that girl chasing him ?
I get that if you revealed his face on the internet it would go viral like it did but wtf he obviously doesn&#39;t want to be openly famous and have everyone know who he is so why the fuck would you try to Video his face
hes supposed to be anonymous you pleb, but of yeah lets try and film his face anyway because it will make me popular but ruin an artists entire style and animosity  .
So what! Totally irrelevant! Art graffiti, post modern? Outdated. Any way, too young to be him. Banksy&#39;s 47 fcol.
Saying that Banksy is expected to have been born in 1972... And this kid looks about 20 at most, its probably fake! Furthermore Banksy uses stencils to do his work and neither of them, from what I could tell were carrying anything like that.
They say he looks like a giant bat
from the same fakers as the shark and tornado videos, why would he be in Australia???
Wait, is that the Beijing Olympic Stadium in the background?
Dickheads
It&#39;s a long ass ally way with 3 people watching out, I doubt &#39;banksy&#39; and those other 3 would run when she got up right close to them with a camera! They would of Gone as soon as they saw her
If it were real you wouldn&#39;t have got that close, as he has spotters.
hows banery?
Police just turned up at my school today because a message was posted on Instagram by &quot; kill clown &quot; saying they&#39;re coming to my school at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_imQQdav-Q&amp;t=90">1:30</a> PM which they didn&#39;t and was confirmed a hoax , this all started in the US &amp; CANADA then moved to the UK &amp; republic of Ireland &amp; now has reached Australia 2 boys were actually chased &amp; stalked on their way to school in England
SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHO BANKSY IS
You fucking idiot
We on some fake ass bullshit right now...
Why would you try and expose him?
delete your account
lame as fuck. You are lame as fuck.
was that in the graffiti street in melbourne aus orrr
I&#39;m pretty sure that the real banksy would imminently sprint away at the sound of &#39;banksy&#39; though right? like i just feel like he wouldn&#39;t even turn around.
What&#39;s wrong with you if he deosnt wants his to be shown then don&#39;t be a lil bitch trying to sneak up on ppl to reveal them self
You just exposed Batman you bitch! You could ruin his career!!!
Glad I have ad block
lol .. whos Banksy ??
do you really think that the real banksy would not notice a woman filmein him for 11 yards away
Isn&#39;t Banksy British? And isn&#39;t this a street in Melbourne? I call mad bullshit
Looks like a fake vid to me. Anyhow the girls voice is super annoying and leave Banksy alone. The great thing about him is that we don&#39;t know how he looks like.
why would you expose banksy you idiot
well done you I bet your pleased with yourself you tool ,leave the man alone if he wants to show the world his identity he will do it on his own terms when he is good and ready.
You can&#39;t invade people&#39;s privacy like that doesn&#39;t matter whether he is banksy or not
Easy to tell the difference between a british and Australian accent.<br>That guy had an Australian one, Banksy is from the UK.<br>Also hoiser lane is famous for its graffiti, so that could have been one of the millions of graffiti artists from around the world.
If this was real I&#39;m prettyyy sure it would make the news
fake as fuck
Who&#39;s Banksy
Who the fish is Banksy
And this is trending because????
That Banksy was Hugh Mongus
sorry to burst your bubble &quot;Banksy&#39;s representatives have slammed the piece as &quot;totally fake&quot; and labelled it as a publicity stunt to promote an unauthorised exhibition of the elusive street artist&#39;s paintings, which is opening soon in Melbourne.
Just google his face. It&#39;s not a mystery.
FAKE
Why would you even approach him like that?
Wats a Banksy?
The art work is in the video! Most people watch the video eagerly trying to see who the mysterious person is.  Not focusing at all on the new piece of finished work. Like the artwork states &#39;we&#39;re fools&#39; Banksy shows us how we are more focused on his unonimus identity than the messages he is trying to convey. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23banksy">#banksy</a>
The only convincing thing about this video. Is the horror of it being filmed vertically
Ÿàÿ¥Ÿà ÿ∞ÿß
Nice...
+Leeds Mitch totally agree with you...Also Banksy spent over a week going back and forth to the Camden lock bridge to compleat a tag, hiding in a bush so he didn&#39;t get seen..So I can&#39;t see him down an ally with people around and exposing himself this far into his career, let alone being chased by a girl in high heels, pmsl..next Elvis in a chip shop...

Fake. Why? Because of the very prominent scroll and scan of the art with focus on his sign.
Is it that hard to turn your phone sideways while recording?!
I was so excited, God damnit. Love Banksy.
Fat hoare let him do his thing and take this down
Who the hell would put their own name there for no reason??
MIKE AND PETE, GET BACK TO WORK
nah that looked very easily faked from what i saw, I don&#39;t believe that for a minute :P sorry love.
Terrible acting
Disgusting and vile
You&#39;re a fucking snitch, even if this is fake, ehy would you want to expose him? Some people will do fucked up things for a few views online.
I couldn&#39;t give 2 fucks anyway
Why is he in Australia? That&#39;s federation square in Melbourne, I thought he was English XD
Fake
Looks like idubbbztv
Banksy WERE? i dint see him . That fella that done one was actually my father :/
Fuck that was fake
In today&#39;s news of what never fucking happened.
Wow just no
fake
LMFAO FAKEST SHIT EVER
I&#39;m glad this is fake because you just could&#39;ve ruined one of the best things about british art. People don&#39;t want to know what Banksy looks like. Even if its multiple people, its still best to keep it secret.
Lone woman sees three hooded figures in a dark alleyway, approaches them with phone in her hand. Yeaaahhhhhh that&#39;s realisic.
congrats you are now viral
faker then my ex&#39;s heart
I think this is fake?
its probably LUSHSUX
Who is banksy
How do people not believe this Banksy? He is clearly shown on camera here. Who else could it have been?
Who the fuck cares who Banksy is anyway? Last time I checked it&#39;s not 2007
100% not banksy nor did he put the art work on the wall
More fake than Nicki minaj&#39;s ass
Lol this is funny because my granny knows banksy&#39;s mum
most fake shit I&#39;ve seen in ages!!!
fake
Every other time a video is recorded of a person no one cares, but as soon as it&#39;s Banksy everyone wants to respect his privacy?
FAAAAAAAAKE
i&#39;m sorry, who is banksy?? i don&#39;t know him well,
fake
one of the great things about Banksy is that no one knows who he is. even though this is clearly a fake, his privacy should be left alone and he should remain a mystery because that&#39;s what makes his artwork stand out from the rest.
He is in Melbourne boi!
Bansky ran away because they saw her recording vertically.
this was done in hosier lane, which is in melbourne australia, and it&#39;s almost definitely a hoax to try to get more people to go to the unauthorised bansky exhibition that you have to pay to get into. i mean, it&#39;s pauline hansen. who, other than australians, actually know who she is anyway.  plus, anyone who respects graffiti at all should understand the point of anonymity , and not post this shit, real or not real.
well first of all that guy looks too young to be banksy and youre probably a tourist¬†so that explains a lot
FAKE
fake
so every mug graffiti&#39;ing is banksy? female logic
What country is this guy from anyway
All you caught is one fat L
Is it Mia Southby
which Banksy . ? silly girl. Banksy (the clue is in the name. ) is a collective. There isn&#39;t a single guy anyway.
so fake
Rip King Robbo
rob gunningham is the original banksy. but now there are many people doing artwork in his name like massive attack.
This is so fake holy shit ahsha
He is busy making his theme park
If that really was Banksy this was a dick move.
Why would you post this.. the entire premise behind banksy is that he wants to stay anonymous, who are you, someone seemingly excited to see him, to record him and post it online, if you were truly a fan you wouldn&#39;t have filmed it at all...<br>what a selfish bitch
The Banksy tag is the give away for a fake here, he hasn&#39;t used it for years. He got so famous and his work is so recognisable that his tag became superfluous. He hasn&#39;t signed off any pieces as Banksy for a long time simply because he doesn&#39;t need to, people know what is his work and what is not.
You should really take this down.<br>This is like telling a kid that father christmas is not real..... your just telling a massive lie
The most set-up bullshit I&#39;ve come across today.
No you didn&#39;t...
I swear he got outed a while back
fake and gay
do you really think he&#39;s that dumb he is a fucking  genius at art and knowing when to and where to produce his art and if anyone ever uncovered him then you would be hated  more than the amount of views you got   but al give you this nice way of drumming up your view numbers clever very clever  also very dumb !üôàüôâüôä
Even if this was actually real, respect the guys choice of privacy. He chose to be anonymous, leave him be. Besides, isn&#39;t it cooler that we don&#39;t know.
We all know that&#39;s LUXSUX
why do people persist in knowing his identity the whole point of banksie is to create revolutionary messages that confront societys values anonymously so why film him and break what he stands for
I hope this is fake. What a stupid thing to do.
That is not banksy.
Who is banksy
That&#39;s impossible because I am banksy
I thought Banksy had already been outed as Robin Gunningham ??
Not him, fact, you are all barking up the wrong tree for sure
DAFUQ...?
Let&#39;s be honest why would banksy do art when he can see people on the street
He&#39;s shit anyway. Very obvious work, generic Proletariat dull stuff we&#39;ve seen over and over again. Sensationalist 21st century. Like something a 14 year old thinks is deep.
Oh wow this poor girl.. u gonna get it now. the internet doesnt appritiate this sort of thing..
That was definitely him, you wouldn&#39;t get a reaction like that for nothing, his eyes are creepy as fuck
How you gunna try and snake him anyway
And that&#39;s how artists stop doing art. Fuck sake, leave him be
Fake :: I don&#39;t think Banksy needs to sign his name on his art.
Except it isn&#39;t.
banksy is snow-informer
xD Sad isn&#39;t it? Nothing can be uploaded to YouTube anymore without it being fake. Get lost people. You don&#39;t know if it&#39;s real or fake. Please be quiet until we find out.
he doesnt sign his work at the bottom...otherwise he&#39;d have people chasing him like this haha
The level of fake made my balls hurt.
Staged
No you didn&#39;t
If your a fan of the artist, why the fuck would you post it on youtube?
Hmmm account created yesterday? Its Pranksy
Fake. He walks away, hears someone calling his name, and instead of running immediately he turns around dramatically with his arm over his face? More importantly, that doesn&#39;t look like his work. His stuff is a lot more dramatic. This is flat and silly. Pretty lame to fake something like this for attention.
You honestly expect people to belive that a man who has never been caught will graffiti in a place where there are people walking by and even watching him and that he wouldn&#39;t do a lot more to cover his face than his arm? Fuck off with this shit.
Bansky went to my secondary school üòÄüòÄüòÄ
Please delete this in order to respect his privacy
it&#39;s so fake he never tags his illegal work he said himself its the same as signing a guilty confession. all the &#39;official&#39; banksy graffiti has never actually been authenticated by him or pest control
I hate the smell of Bullshit.
Haha nope
To whoever filmed this - why? He&#39;s making people think and creating a piece of art in accessible places - he clearly wants to be anonymous so why pull a phone out? And on top of that he clearly didn&#39;t appreciate it so why upload it to YouTube?
lol nice try
BLAAAAAAAAG AS FUCK like he would turn around to say fuck off you fucking moron
check the like dislike ratio
100% Fake<br>And if it was actually Banksy then your a piece of shit for running after him. The reason noone knows what he looks like is because he wants his privacy for many reasons and for you to go and stick a camera in his face is intruding his privacy and out right rude.
Too fake
fake
6k disliked this garbage lmfao get it down .... fake as fuck
Thats not him, he works alone.
ugh leave banksy alone ya idiot. respect their wish to be anonymous
Fake and gay
Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but this guy is doing vandalism and you guys are ok with this shit?
fake as FUCK
Glad it&#39;s fake but do check out RedVexX Gaming
may he stay hidden forever
Either this is fake or I just got my clit licked from banksy same night?
FAKE
I read the title as catching a banshee on tape, or something like that. I was so confused.
this is fake. and if it was real, finally this vandal would be caught. he painting may have meaning but it is still very much vandalism
Fake
leave Banksy ALONE!!!
Fake
I may try this lol.
it is a advert for fingerless gloves...there making a come back
i thought it was FaZe Banks
Who the hell is banksy
No offence but who the fuck is Banksy though?
glad this is fake
he&#39;s black
Fake üòÇ
He once did a painting by where I used to live. And on the night he did it I was out drinking and would have walked back late at night, right next to where he did it, literally could see it from the front door. But instead I stayed at my brothers! The work was the Cheltenham phone box painting
fake
Not Banksy, far too young and wrong accent.
lol he dabbed
advice to banksy: grow a beard and change your glasses.
Who the fuck is Banksy?
The great thing about his art is the mystery around it,now you just fucked that sensation up
Wanksy is a Fraud! just ask Xavier Prou, aka Blek le Rat.
is a fake
Not banksy he brings curtains and dresses as a construction worker
Respect his famous anonymity, it&#39;s what makes him special
Fucking CRINGE
1. He looks like a teenager.<br>2. He just said &quot;f*** off&quot; (I think).<br>3. He seemed to stencil the word &quot;Banksy&quot; so there is little evidence.
This that&#39;s banksy then I&#39;m James Bond
There&#39;s a reason why he doesn&#39;t want to be known so leave him anonymous, how disrespectful of you!
Who&#39;s bansky
So confusedü§îü§î
OMG THIS IS SO REAL GUYS<br>i CAN&#39;T BELIEVE IT..... :/
Fake
next video: the tooth fairy caught on camera
I&#39;m 100% sure that Banksy employs people to do his street work... I&#39;m 200% sure that this is a publicity stunt, to promote his current show in Melbourne &amp; I&#39;m 300% sure that guy was under 30, re-confirming that it&#39;s not Banksy.
Grass
Faker than the monetisation on this video.
No u become bankey when u look at his art
Guys guess what I&#39;m Banksy I looked at his spray paintings
Obviously fake, Banksy is Chinese. These people are black!
Banksy is a criminal
Banksy has been doing artwork for years you dumb bitch...Farley sure he doesn&#39;t sound that premature and would have the common sense to not turn around and keep his identity unknown which he&#39;s been doing so since the 1990&#39;s. Although there is a good case, I&#39;ve done some research and this painting had not been seen until this video came to light...so yes maybe this is Banksy but then again this is not DAMNING evidence...please correct me if I&#39;m wrong
Why try and get his identity out you silly bint?
Total bullshit small fry üå±
Faker than Nikkis ass
Legit
Definitely real...
This is faker than the LeafyIsHere and DramaAlert sub count...
What the hell is bansky?is he bucky brother from captain murica?
fake and gay
His accent isn&#39;t even Bristolian
who&#39;s banksy?
Banksy is my favourite artist, my biggest inspiration. Such a cool video. x
Well if it was or it wasn&#39;t. Your bang out of fucking order. Why would you want to expose him? It&#39;s the same as being a grass, as far as I&#39;m concerned. The lowest of the low. I suspect, like everyone else though. It&#39;s fake. What a fucking imbecile you must be
who the fuck is banksy?
A well deserved dislike
Shame this looked faked
if it was or wasnt  why the fuck are you running up and grabbing people..?
it looks like the real him if you compare the nose to the pictures online they&#39;re similar
holy shit this real?
I&#39;m not convinced. Why would he turn around? Why not just run off on the first place....I think this is fake. I reckon he wears a balaclava when he does his art anyway.
That was not bansky
Fake?!?!
Bruh!üò£
Report this video?
No, I&#39;m the real Banksy!
It&#39;s me!. I&#39;m Banksy. Pretending to hide.

Who&#39;s banksy
This is so fucking stages
Fake I, whether you believe me or not is your decision, met him in person and he is not currently in America he is in Scotland he doesn&#39;t wear glasses either btw.
Fake ! You are a nob your channel wants taking down ..flagged
thumbs up if you think this should be removed (or don&#39;t it&#39;s your choice)
Fake
Banksy is not just ONE person.....
If this was real why would he turn around towards the camera and not just run off?
The fake banksy mumbles &quot;fuck off&quot;
Banksy wears a mask when out doing his work this is fake
Bullshit Banksy&#39;s got the evasion skills of a MI6 agent there is no way he would have caught this easily. He&#39;s been anonymous for years!
If he wants to keep his identity a secret then why do that? I know this is probably fake tho
odd.hmm.cool
good eye sight to tell thats banksey.
pretty sure this is hoosier lane melbourne.
Next video: I caught God in camera!
maybe this video was made by banksy to lead people away from his true identity
Fucking FouseyTube back at it again with them fake ass videos
He just happened to be down that alley in America
thats bansky but Y do that u should be arrested for revealing he identity its ment to be a big secret for fun but u spoiled it
This video should have one a streamy award because it&#39;s fake as guck
This is rude tbh. He wanted to stay anonymous and now you fucked it up
Anyone here who dosent know who banksy is?
Almost as fake as the ads on pornhub: Kate is horny and is only 2 miles away
So fakeüòíüòí
Don&#39;t ruin the magic
I swear they already caught bansky
Respect the legacy
DID YE AYE???
Fake
Who&#39;s banksy
a true banksy fan would never upload this video. shame on you.
fake as fuck
Hate these fake fucking timewasting imbeciles, the scumbag can&#39;t even speak proper English
that&#39;s one question answered... banksy is a man
so u just happen to be walking round in the dark with a big ass camera lol not in my neighbourhood
Top Kek this shit if fake as fuck
Who else knew it was gonna be fake before they watched the video?
<a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168637">https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168637</a>
Who is Banksy
As if...
Why did you do that? We should help him to stay anonymous Not the other way around
Right when you hear me whistle you know I&#39;ve started recording and started walking towards you.
hmmmmm
bollocks
who is banksy?
His voice is too young and not posh enough.
If you seriously think that&#39;s him then you&#39;re a fucking moron, Banksy&#39;s been at this game for YEARS, like he&#39;s really that careless...
Seems like a nice guy
Fake
it&#39;s bill Clinton
I could act better than that
if this is real this is so disrespectful... but I don&#39;t think that shit was real hahaha
Unauthentic &amp; homosexual
Delete this before anyone sees
My god how staged was that fake as fuck people
Dicks.
SO FAKE
Take it down, everyone report this video
just a kid wanting the fame and people spreading rumours that he is banks, simplest way to get that sort of attention
This better be fake if the artist doesn&#39;t wanna be known then don&#39;t fucking show it this is all sorts of fucked up and I hope you get what&#39;s coming to you
If it is him, why did you post this? You&#39;re just ruining his work
That was Gary from the Fish shop.
When banksy does his work he has a team of people and covers himself lots. He also does it using stencils in like 2 minutes so no this isnt him.
he wears a mask
fake
fake why would he turn around
WOOWWWWW
WOOWWWWW
Delete the fucking video
Fakeeeeeeeee
fake Banksy not one person it&#39;s a group of people. Banksy is a anagram. no more.
Wish it was realüò±
Please explain? FUCKOFFWE&#39;REFOOLS
what sort of idiot would want to reveal who banksy is?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>its much cooler not to keep it a mystery
who&#39;s bansky or what ever anyways
that was blek le rat pretending to be banksy, like how banksy pretends to be blek le rat
BANKSY IS FROM BRISTOL THAT ISN&#39;T NO BRISTOL ACCENT
Who gives to fucks.<br>Slave to the bullshit folks
TBH it might be him because if you look hard on the newspaper articles you can see some features it kinda looks like Banksy. But on the other hand it could be a total fraud
if it isn&#39;t fake then really wtf respect the guys privacy you do realise he&#39;s broken the law for doing his art if he&#39;s exposed then police would go nuts looking for him
Bollocks
Guys, why Banksy lizard man beneath earth crust?
This is either fake or filmed by an inconsiderate women
Why do Americans always have to spoil things?
Nope...
If it is fake it is sad. If it is real then you are a cow.
everyone is this comment section too mad
Banksy wouldn&#39;t be caught
Fake
Fake
it&#39;s fake defo and if it was him why try and get his face on cam. if it gets our he will get is so mutch shit... some people don&#39;t think.
THATCHERJOE MUST REACTY
Banksys a black woman
You&#39;re as bad as a grass if this is real.
first, this is obviously staged. plus it&#39;s about the art, not the man
who the fuck is banksy and why is everyone so hyped for this idiot?
Why do people care so much about banksy?<br>Jesus
cringe
the fuck is this fake shit
Why would you do this
take this down
you cant do this to the guy. take the video off. if he&#39;s arrested, what else is he gonna produce?
Yea if this is real, its pretty low move to post his face on social media. Not if you want it to be possible for him to keep doing what he&#39;s doing. You could ruin the guys career like this.
this guy sounds eastern european... i don&#39;t think banksy is polish.
whos bamsky
Another indicator of how fake this is, is that his guys would be on hand keeping look out and it&#39;s pretty obvious they&#39;d spot someone with a camera walking down the alley. Plus I don&#39;t think Banksy has actually signed a piece of street art for about a decade. Any prick with a stencil can do that.
To me, as a Bristolian (where Banksy is from) that sounds very much like an Australian accent under that scarf. Fake.
-NO! -¬†I&#39;m Banksycus!...er, SpartaBanks, er Spartasbanksacus -oh, forget it.
thers more than one person working for the main artist so u will never catch him . EVER
leave him the fuck alone you fame hungry bitch
This is faker than <b>*submit your jokes below*</b>
Haha is that Pauline Hanson?
Haha is that Pauline Hanson?
But Massive Attack isn&#39;t in town!  There&#39;s more to street art than JUST Banksy..!  Commonwealth Games 2006 cleared so much of his work &amp; Melbourne at one stage had probably the most ... All gone now!
Faker than the 350 million going to the NHS
Pretty sure Banksy would be with a group of people at all angles so there was a fair warning if someone was coming. Maybe put up some fake bollards or tape so nobody could walk down where he was. Maybe a van he could just jump into in quick siuations. He&#39;s been doing this for years. That&#39;s not Banksy.
Three sorts of comments here:<br>&quot;Leave him alone and respect his privacy&quot;<br>&quot;FAKE&quot;<br>&quot;Filmed sideways&quot;<br><br>Now for MY comment.<br><b>WHO THE FUCK GIVES A SHIT.</b> This video could have easily have been another 51 views video had the media not gotten to it.<br><br>My point is that this video is meaningless. I know that Banksy&#39;s lack of identity is a signature thing with him, but seriously, <b>this is just someone who &quot;just happened&quot; to run into the elusive Banksy just as he was (as the uploader puts it) &quot;was finishing up&quot;</b><br>It&#39;s also rather interesting that you simply walked up to him after &quot;backing up&quot; and just recorded what he had done, and walked RIGHT alongside him. ALSO interesting how you just caught him as he was writing a tiny section of the signature. If this is fake or not shouldn&#39;t even be a debate, NEITHER sides have any sort of proof.
Oh my god this is so fake. Why would you even do this? Is it so that people would click on the video, maybe watch an advert and give you a bit of money? Maybe they even dislike it so that it can trend further, is that why? Maybe they even leave a comment, generating social interactions and therefore making the video become even more popular, did you upload it because of that? Did you upload this because you knew that people would share it, probably talking about how fake it is, thus giving you more views and interest, well did you? Well it didn&#39;t work. The people here on YouTube aren&#39;t that dumb to fall for such a clickbaity title and then generate views and comments to further promote yourself. Let me just read the rest of the comm... oh... well... I guess...
That is not me
What the fuck is a Banksey?
What the fuck are you doing!!... &quot;Oh gawd, I love Banksy so much I&#39;ve gotta be the one who gets his face on camera so I can get all the internet likes&quot; .... oh and he&#39;ll go to prison too you dumb fucker!! <br><br>and if it&#39;s fake, well done for wasting everyone&#39;s time... at least you still get those views though ;)
If this is true, this is SO infuriating. His identity is completely irrelevant and we DO NOT need to know who he is!
Ah delete it. ! Let him have his mystic ! I wouldn&#39;t want to be known as the &quot;twat who outed Banksy&quot; !!!
She starts off by saying I think it&#39;s Banksy...  Before she&#39;s even at the piece. See if that was me I&#39;d put my finger on the wet paint and show it to the camera as extra proof.
Clearly fake, if he&#39;s just painted that where&#39;s his paint and the stencil he just used?
camera work has been rehearsed! far to steady and the panning from picture to logo to planned.  Try Harder next time
It&#39;s fake, but when you learn a magician&#39;s tricks it takes away the magic. Stop trying to compromise the mystery, whoever you are.
Buuuulllshit
Wait who is Banksy?
you saw a person spray painting, left. Then came back got your phone out vertically just as &quot;banksy&quot; finished. of course you did.
Next time.  Flip the camera sideways dagnamit
Who&#39;s Bansky?
Fake shit, just fuck off
fake snake take make fake lake fake fake fake fake
If this is real it&#39;s disgusting, he wants to stay anonymous for a reason
&quot;Can&#39;t believe I met Banksy&quot; yeah because that isn&#39;t Banksy. If it was, he would have kept composure and walked off quietly without turning. Making a scene would only make it obvious who he was. He would never do that, how else has he kept himself a mystery all this time? Not by turning to someone filming him that&#39;s for sure.
So fake aha!
