This is the real trailer for Shrek 5, they just disguised it as a trailer for Magic The Gathering. The gingerbread king and queen are obviously the parents of gingerbread man from the movies, which would make him a prince. This is an amazing plot twist, only fit for a franchise like Shrek.<br><br>But the real proof is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzQ4KpOtfVs&amp;t=24">0:24</a><br><br>Notice how there is a Golden Egg in the basket? Doesn’t that remind you of something? It should, because it is the same golden egg as in the Puss in Boots movie. And because Puss is a character in Shrek, we can conclude that this is in fact the trailer for Shrek 5. They are just trying to fool us all!<br><br>WAKE UP SHEEPLE!
Gingy&#39;s parents!?
It’s Fake So No.
Shrek 5 shrek donkey dragon dronkey fiona baby ogre arthur puss in boots gingerbread man is dead gingerbread girl big bad wolf three pig three blind mouse pinocchio
Waking on the sun is a shrek 5 song
Live Action Shrek Maybe
This Feels Like A Remake Of The First Film Rather Than A Sequel To Shrek Forever After
I love this romantic epic song “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” 😍
Ohh so this is what happened to Gingy’s parents
How did i just discover this- 😭 love this👏
Elden Ring sure looks fresh. Now I get the hype.
I think this video made with sourece filmmaker software.
i mean, whatever this is I&#39;m more invested than the third shrek.
Normal people: cool ginger bread cookie game <br>Freaks: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzQ4KpOtfVs&amp;t=132">2:12</a>

There was a  concept trailer with shrek ripping the story out of the book and saying &quot;Like that&#39;s ever going to happen.&quot; Made me laugh, very rare.

This is a trailer for the magic the gathering digital card game I think
Parece un anuncio de cereal
Mentira
Yeah umm that’s raid shadow legends I think
This looks like a reboot of it
This is the throne of eldrane which is a expansion of a card game
Son of a bitch, almost fall on it
I think it&#39;s from world of war craft or I don&#39;t know
It&#39;s a trailer from a game
Its a fanmade animation
Clickbait
