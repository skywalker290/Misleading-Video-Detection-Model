There must be a hole 🕳 from the firmament above somehow.
skypiea is real
Nice editing
There’s something in the water 😳
is this geyser?
I think it was a damage giant water pipe
Water is coming from the ground, moving extremely high up in the middle, then down from the outter layer.  Like when you shoot a garden hose in the air but on a larger scale. Clouds just so happened to be at a decently low level to create an illusion if recorded at the right angle. 100% positive he didn’t angle the camera towards the sky because he knew he was going to trick people with this one.
I&#39;m a Christian and I think this is a burst water line or similarly natural phenomenon
100% Edit 😂 Each time a vehicle passes camera angle changes 😂
AMEN GOD IS GOOD
AMEN GLORY TO GOD AMEN
I guess we know how God did the flooding lol
The firmament,No way can a Cloud produce that much Water
It&#39;s a burst mains. The water in the centre is going upwards and down wards on the outside. Either way,  it looks awesome.
God decided to take a piss
Throw a coin in it and make a wish.
That isn&#39;t god your just dumb it&#39;s a water spout
He did say it when he come back the world will be flooded with water
It&#39;s Satan taking a long needed Piss. 😅
We have a new phenomenon made by god: Its da Cloudfalls
Imagine if someone swimmed under that- 💀
WOW. A fountain. Noone has ever seen  a water-fountain ever before. Must be the landing zone for Jesus.
It&#39;s the water above us
WHY DIDN&#39;T YOU GO CLOSE? An American would!! Touch it ... But anyway thanks for the shot
That looks like a geyser
God got mad and peed
what if someone get stucks there
there&#39;s a hole in the roof lol
WOW
well i guess its that one tree taking a shower
Pipe line in da middle of nothing?
fantastic
Fake
It’s either a geyser or a bursted pipe
I’d go under and stay until it’s done
Hahaha watch it in slow motion you can clearly see at the top the gap between the end of the water and the clouds behind so the water doesn’t even reach the clouds. Also the fixed jet in the centre of the water staying still whilst the rest is moving definitely a burst pipe either that or someone has a very powerful hose.
Thats amazing
Wtf
What is happening?
It looks like the is editing somewhere
didn’t you guys take science classes growing up ? it’s just a cloud letting go of it’s moisture in only one area as opposed to the normal rainfall we see usually shaddering from each cloud in within the radius. we don’t often get to see it so i get what you mean, it is pretty interesting.
That&#39;s all of mist
Geyser?  Large broken water pipe spraying up under high pressure?
a broken waterpipe fountain
🥰 APTTMHY! 🙌🏾🔥🙌🏾🔥🙌🏾
That&#39;s a geyser
This is real
قال الله تعالى : ( ففتحنا أبواب السماء بماء منهمر )

Fake. He doesn&#39;t show the sky.. This water is firing from underground and it returns
It&#39;s this simple all of those cars going up and down the road would be stopping everywhere and be in awe trying to figure this out. This is poor quality video manipulation.
proof that Earth is flat
God is watering the plants himself lol!
Wow
What a fake video
It’s a pipeline that broke
Fake
nice creation
Hmm But the water is shooting down.. not up?  Are there pipes burst in the sky?
We are surrounded by water.. the flood was orchestrated and caused by putting a hole in the dome!!
This is amazing and I give all glory to God
Anyone with common sense would have moved around and filmed from various angles, the sky, and the flooding that would have occurred from that much water. And to prove it&#39;s not a burst pipe, the guy should have stuck around to film the ground after the &quot;waterfall&quot; stopped, to show if there was a pipe or not. And it sure seems odd that no other vehicles are stopping. Maybe because this is just another internet video hoax to gain views?
Why didn&#39;t you film the sky you dimwit. Cause you wrong
It´s a lot of watter, but where does all of that watter goes after reach ground. There should be flood everywhere around.
That must be an every day thing which surprises no one because all those people are just driving by like nothing is going on. So the question is, why is the guy taking the video surprised? Oh! I know why, it&#39;s a hoax! Nice try but common sense wins again.
this from the real God Allah. you moron anthiest will say that it was from nature lol.
Infact some people do not believe in God&#39;s wonders. U should really watch the video good before commenting. This one drop is directly from the Heavens. People who never saw wonders before will not believe. Any clever observant will surely know where this mistery coming from. The Bible says: going to the end, many wonders shall appear in the sky. Over to u doubters.
this water is from heaven
Learn to edit dude you totally just showed your or someone else license plate..
sure looks like it&#39;s coming from the clouds
