If it doesn’t have the opening song, what is the point?
Sadly, did an injustice to the Reunion.
Im glad this didn’t came out. Let fantasy live in our minds. And with chandler gone now we have  to let go.
What is the story behind this movie that never came out ?
After the untimely passing of Matthew Perry, I really wish we had gotten this movie. I know the main cast would have been a blast, but imagine if Cole Sprouse came back to play a grown-up version of Ben, and he meets his sister for the first time! Bringing back the entire cast would have been incredible for the show, and it[s a shame we&#39;ll never see it now.
Hi did this movie show up ?
RIP Matthew 😢
What  is  the  actual   movie  name   of  this   movie  i  cant   find  this  movie
Would been a LOT better with just a small amount of video fixing. Got different resolutions, framerates, video thats deinterlaced, and then not..... and it is just a cluttered random trailer...no story to it really.
it is VFX or is there a movie....please tell the name of the movie 😢😢
What are these scenes actually from?
Hell no! Why are Monica and chandler not together??? they have the twins what could’ve happened that they look like they haven’t seen each other in years. Ross and Rachel have Emma and it looked like they finally were together so did that not happen. No no no.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpa5S8DgPzs&amp;t=103">1:43</a> <br>Gurl has no shadow ⚫
I hope I see it before I die
Where can I find this...?
Friends program is good to watch,also all the friends makes money at the same time.Just like friends business.
where are all these clips from? sources please
Where is this movie aired?
That’s cougar town
hold on is this an actual movie or not?
What is this like there is no movie like this.I 😕 😭😭😭
So did it not come out ????😐
Where are the clips from ?
Was this ever released?
It&#39;s not real
I have the perfect idea for a &quot;closure&quot;  with all the storylines solved, in a format that all fans would love (I am a writer and a great fan) and a product that probably would also sell not bad in DVD with some extras and streaming... but no idea how to pitch it to the producers. Any idea or link? I live in the UK. Thanks.
What happened to this Movie? Why was it never released?
How dare you trick my Dad
Ahloa I’m shanebearddj awesome
When is this movie releasing
aw, all the clips with monica are from cougar town…..😢
This didn&#39;t happened why?
So theres not really a movie, or is there? I am confused.
the writers kid, not just actors
I used to think this was real
From where this clips are ..
What a terrible idea. Stop trying to wring the last drop of joy out of the past. Stop killing memories out of greed. Leave the past alone and do something new.
The reunion what we deserve!
soon? soon? When? Can&#39;t wait
No, if Mondler are ever apart that&#39;s it for me. Then I would stop believing in love.
is this real, please tell me it is
Не обязательно что-то рушить, чтобы что-то создать. Так и тут. В каждой семье можно найти много забавного и интересного. А нам - радость видеть наших любимых героев. Дай Бог им всем здоровья!) Очень их всех люблю.
Still hoping 🙌
These are paemrts from cougar town
Matthew Perry looks so fck up from the drugs 😔😔😔
Sorry dude but that sucked.

We dont need that kind of movie :( dont do this to us
I don&#39;t get it from where are those scenes I mean I really expected a film but it was just a talkshow or something is that just me? I thought it was going to be a film
I feel like I saw this trailer in theatre&#39;s. 🤔
Where did the clips came from?? TT
Is this the movie?
Is this a movie ? When us it going to be aired in India pls help me know....because 27th may 2021 which was available on Zee is not what is shown in this trailer

Watched the actual reunion episode today, but this trailer seemed more fulfilling that that!
Is this a real movie?
Sale fuddu bnata h
I want this movie
I don&#39;t understand, was it all edited because, on 27 May 2021, we didn&#39;t get a F.R.I.E.N.D.S reunion movie but just a get-together. What this teaser trailer actually is?<br>My mind is blowing, if someone knows, kindly explain.
I WANT THIS AS AN ACTUAL MOVIE. OHMYGOD.

(well I really hope they do)
Does this film exist ?

this is so depressing. killing the whole glory image of friends.
This movie is going to make people cry than laugh 😭😭🥺🥺
Please somebody tell people that isn&#39;t a real friends reunion, this is a compilation of TV shows were they have appeared trough  the years after Friends.
Where is Gunther?!

No no no! These friends are family. They don&#39;t just &quot;reunite&quot; after years!
after years of not seeing each other??? you mean to tell me they didnt live happily ever after? im so sad
Is this real?
F.R.I.E.N.D.S: <b>WE WERE ON A BREAK</b>
If this is real, I&#39;m having a bad feeling about Friends movie.
Did they say Rachel was having a baby? At 51?! Their children should all be college age. Ben is what 25? Come on folks. Stop erasing Gen X.
This real?
These is real? I want see these movie!!!
is this a real one or somethng else? plz someone tell me
is this a real one or somethng else? plz someone tell me
This is a mix of different movies. This is not Friends and will never be!
This video doesn&#39;t give me nostalgic emotions at all. They seem more like strangers than close friends that they were many years ago.
Why does everybody have to have marriage trouble? The relationships in friends were so perfect
Jennifer Aniston is better now i think
Please god no.  Let that show die already.
is it true?
Guys is there any site Despite Netflix. Which is free to watch all seasons of friends
Aniston luce bellísima. Definitivamente ella es mi tipo de mujer. En todo...
When omg ❤️❤️❤️
So, Lisa takes bath in virgins&#39; blood. Or she is an Elf.
About time YAS!
Where are all these clips from ?<br>Is this real
They can&#39;t make a reunion without it breaking my heart.  The gap is too long. God I love them all though.
why am I seeing this now
omg i cried..
With so many series being brought back, why can&#39;t FRIENDS be?
they mixed clips together of them in other movies I’m pretty sure it’s not real tho idk for sure tho

wtf?
&quot;Friends&quot;  a favorite, no one &quot;but anyone&quot; that had actually watched the show would ever  know what was being  talked about = &quot;tricky&quot;
Some scenes of Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) are from the movie  The switch!
Some of this is from a program called cougar town it is really good and it is nothing to do with friends!!!
Chandler and monica are like one body, two souls
yesssssss!!!!!!!!!!
You need to make a 1M movies of friends
Fucking Covid. we would probably have already had the reunion if people would fucking listen when they are told to stay inside, but it was too hard for them. so now the world is fucked and we still don&#39;t have the reunion.
OH MY GOD
They&#39;ve been working on this since last  millenium!
Why did they make it so depressing? Geez. What a let down.
where is janice &#39;oh my god&#39;
Badly waiting ❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭
This does not look like friends it’s like a whole new show it’s been too long they don’t need a reunion I rather have it left as it is
Whats the Name of the Song? Pls. Stell me????

This is so lame for a concept trailer...it&#39;s just going to be alot of forced and bad acting, botox smiles, too much makeup and plastic surgery

Without Joey&#39;s &quot;HOW YOU DOING&quot; I don&#39;t approve of the trailer.

I am in 2020 (October), and Oo god obviously the movie it isn’t in Netflix or the cinema.
Someone here actually on 2020??
anyone know when its coming out? plz reply to this and lmk
The thing even sadder than the fact that Monica and Chandler are not together anymore, is the fact that Rachel referred Chandler as Monica’s ex ! Like he was just an acquaintance...
the trailer is disappointing
It’s not real unfortunately
Oh my god yes.
Is this a real movie?
Phoebe all time best

This trailer felt nothing like FRIENDS <br>I miss Joey &quot; HOW YOU DOING ?&quot; And Monica&#39;s &quot; I KNOWwwww &quot; , Chandler&#39;s &quot; Lame yet funny joke plus Dumb expression &quot; and what the heck happened to rose and Rachel ? 😭
I have seen friends 9 times, without bloopers,  short videos on youtube. It is my favorite movie I ever seen. and I will see it from the beginning to the end again and again again with my children, grand children, great grand children until the day I die and I an only 21 years old. I would love to see friends re union,  Emma turning 18, the triplet, the Bing twin and  Ben. i don.t know it&#39;s so exciting .....            I can.t wit to see the reunion
But Monica and chandler? What happened to their children and house
Christ on a crutch.
Where did they get all these clips from I dint understand
Rachel hasn&#39;t age....
OM A OOOOMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>nice

Ross ❤ rachel

So it looks like Phoebe became a doctor and Rachel’s a consellor? Wouldn’t Phoebe  become the concellor? Have to wait and see?!
So this is how namjoon picked up his English huh.
When it&#39;s gonna release......... 😍

If we had a power to wash away &quot;friends&quot;  from our memories do we could watch it all over again

This bring me back memories
Djabeisso ,mah? Eita mah
<i>These guys got pretty old ya but they still ✨ can&#39;t forget themm😍🔥 and for some reason i got really emotional watching this video...they reunited after </i><b><i>YEARS</i></b><i> 💙 its a mixed emotion</i>
there is actually a line in friends saying by 2020 there will be floating tvs. instead we have smart masks and imasks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpa5S8DgPzs&amp;t=118">1:58</a> this scene is from jimmy kimmel&#39;s show!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpa5S8DgPzs&amp;t=57">0:57</a> Monica looks young like she&#39;s doing friends all over again
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpa5S8DgPzs&amp;t=48">0:48</a> did i just see a muslim drinking drugs at the right.
ive been watching this over and over crying and having hope that they&#39;ll be back
Um just saying like did they make something with them all in because it looks like it
If only this were real
Ok but was it really nessasary that chandler and Monica had 2 divorce. Watch this be one of those reunions that everyone hates
Did anyone at least smiled once?
Yes.  They neeed to make a movie!
Hbo max
Is this real
GIVE IT UP!
i just dont get it
I saw very less scenes of phoebe and Ross in the trailer 🙄
Es de verdad?
They all prayed to Satan before every show, enough said.
Im a huge fan of friends and this was not what i was hoping for.  We will see what the movie brings but i dont approve of the trailer.  Pheobe as a doctor completly  ruins her fun character that we all grown to love.  Cant wait to see the movie
I keep getting messages about which of my songs are being used on here. They&#39;re &quot;We Can Do This&quot; and &quot;Hiking&quot;—you can find them by searching the titles and my name on Google. :)<br><br>(Thanks again for this, Rob!)
I always thought that when their kids grow up they will be as good friends as the original group and all will be happy....but here it is....nothing like my imagination
OMG, this is nothing like the F.R.I.E.N.D.S we saw!!!
bruh my mom thought this was an actual trailer
Better be good!
I watch all series 10 Season every Year... this years to i watching.. before 20 years i say in my girl friends i watching Friends series an she is say wow i dont like American Series i say please watch only one times... and she say okay after she watch 1 series later watch togheter every days... ans this series help me i wdding for my girl friends and after 20 years i watch nog again Friends series with my wife and my kids...

Is it silly to cry cause this series is over and seeing monica and chandler not to together in this trailer also when the movie will come out
This is from the series couger town .. not friends its a lie
They really DO need to make a friends movie. It looks EPIC
Crying!!!😭 Where and when I can find this movie and watch it???!! That&#39;s amazing!!!👏💖 The best part is Joey winning Oscar!!!🥰😭👏 What&#39;s yours favourite part?🤔👍
Chk this out<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTGIAKVjzS4">https://youtu.be/eTGIAKVjzS4</a>

I just have a few questions<br>1. Where is Rachel’s Baby, Emma?<br>2. Where is Chandler and Monica’s twins?<br>3. Where is Mike?
F I&#39;m crying
why god why???ohh goddd you had a deal with joey!!!! i am cryingg for real. this gonna be sad not a comedy!!!!!!
Aren&#39;t Rachel and Ross together? Are Monica and Chandler divorced? WHAAAT?!
Who is dying here..🥺🥺😭😭😭
No just no!!!!!
ENSERIO VA A VER UNA PELICULA DE F.R.I.E.N.D.S!!
¿No es joda!!
No, no, no.
Who&#39;s get emotional ?<br>I know everyone gets.
It seems like more of a trajedy than a comedy
I have cried
when is it realising???
Just want to remind everyone that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the coming weeks/months will play a pivotal role in the timing and development of the Friends reunion special. Be safe out there, and don&#39;t forget to continue being on a break from gathering together without wearing masks and staying at least six feet apart.
I refuse to live in the world where chandler and Monica are devorced😤
Stop playing with my feelings like thiiiis😭😭😭😭
Oh my god they are really coming back😭😭😭😭😭 so sooooo excited
Why oh why did Courtney Cox get her face done? I know what’s done is done but man it almost doesn’t even seem like the same character of Monica even though it’s her. I realize aging makes people look different but at least the others aged gracefully.
I so can’t wait for this...love you guys :)
Idk why I wanna cry.
Ross hasn&#39;t changed a bit!!!!
Can anybody tell me the music of this trailer??
Thing that CANT happen in friends reunion, or else we die: Monica and chandler divorce 😁🥺🥺❤️❤️
Stop playing with our feelings. When I finished the TV show I literally was a second close to a heart attack... Pls sort everything out in this movie
Anyone missing the laughing sound on the background 😔😔
I need to know what is the name of the song that plays in the background please anyone i’m crazy looking for it soooooo pretty
You all heard that intro right??😂
I just can&#39;t believe...is it for real...
Someone tell me if this is true
Even though this was a teaser...you made me smile...🖤🖤
Eu preciso ver isso 😍😍😍😍
Are they really making the movie?? pls reply.
IS THIS LEGIT!? LIKE
Sedihhhhhhh, baru tahu film ini sekarang... Dan pemainnya udah pada tua sekarang😭😭
Anyone can you mention all the movie/ show names of these clips here?
Can you mention the movie names ??
Who else is regretting watching this?

😢😢😢😢

milusjem skskaqrňtsku
Wait is this an actual thing?!😭
as i thought, the energy of this is wierd
is this real? I mean is this going to happen or what? because I am not able to belive this!!
I....don’t like this.
I cried
Can anyone recomend  netflix to create  friends 2nd generation  for our teenanger now....
Can someone tell me is this real or just some scene of the movies they in?
Why am I tearing up
Rechel and ross belong together forever and ever!
I love it
Shoot, does anybody know thr background guitar music they used for this? Its so good and i can&#39;t find it anywhere...
doesn&#39;t looks good
This can be the only good thing to happen in 2020,,,,
This thing is going to happen to all of us😢
is it really real
Is this real
Is this the real thing? Are Monica and Chandler... divorced..?
Seeing this Only one thought came in my mind. Time flies and we got to enjoy every moment with our loved ones.
Still I love to watch friends over n over again..
Love this ☺️🥺
This can’t be real cause when chandler saw Monica he was like he had first met her
But what about Rachel and Ross?!?
Nostalgia for nineteenth period ☹️...the new world with Facebook and technology so ugly
Its a dream
Why did they waste their time on this 2 years ago without bringing reunion out! Why tease fans if they wasn&#39;t doing one seemed pointless.
Is this real?
I want this to be true so bad I need a movie
UGHHH I WANT TO JUST CRY IDK WHY!!!
PLZ is this real or not
this literally makes me cry
Anybody know the song towards the end?
I don’t know why but this made me cry
Is this real?
I cry a bit....😢😢I miss them so much can&#39;t wait...😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍
What the hell this is not Friends for some reasons <br>-monica is lesvian and have a divorce with chandler and Jack and reachel dies <br>WTF
Looks like they are not continuing friends story😔
Okay but y&#39;all, imagine this:<br>A sequel sitcom show to Friends, but about all their kids (Ben, Emma, the triplets, and the twins) with the occasional special guest appearance from one/two/some of the original cast!
wait r these scenes real? where r they from?
OMG are you kidding me?
No movie, this is &quot;movie&quot; trailer from episodes...........PLS MAKE MOVIEEEEEE
Is this real?<br>If it is Y r chandler and Monica not together 😭😭😭😭
Is that true ?
Can someone please give us the sources of the clips <br><br>Were they from a movie ? Or sketch ?<br><br>I. NEED. ANSWERS.

This is a movie or a new season???
HBO max
GENTEE SOU BRASILEIRA E NÃO TO ENTENDENDO NADAAAAAA. ALGUEM PODE ME RESPONDER SE F•R•I•E•N•D•S• VAI VIR COMO UM FILME OU SLA????
Its sad bcz of no background laughs or is it actually sad?
Joey still the best<br>.<br>.<br>Monica looking dull
There is no scene of two best buddies chandler and joe together <br>.<br>.<br>So this trailer is not approved 😏
It’s not right. It’s not got the same feel as friends. And I think it’s because friends was about people in there 20 and 30 and not middle age
Why did I not know about this I’ve re watched friends too many times now
When and where  can we watch  this 😭😭
Hey does anyone know where all these scenes came from?
I’m crying 😭😭😭 My babiessss
Idk why but this kinda depresses me
Sad to seeing them getting aged so fast
I swear to g*d This is gonna be my fav movie ever if this comes out
What is the soundtrack of this video, I need to know lol
Is this for real?
Anyone know the name of the background music that starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpa5S8DgPzs&amp;t=43">0:43</a>?
Can someone plis tell me where are the clips from?
very emotional I cried 😢
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpa5S8DgPzs&amp;t=48">0:48</a> wow ArAb 🤟🏻🤟🏻
Where is BEN AND EMMA!!!!!
Is this real?
YES!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Plz no language like that 😭
Sad it&#39;s not happening there only gonna be saying how they miss eachother
GOD DAMN CORONA MADE FHIS NOT HAPPEN
I cry every time
Leave a like if you want friends movie and see them ever again👍💪👍💪!!!!
Is this real?? I&#39;m so confused. How was this made?
Is this real
Algum br aq?
friends Whas Big In Ethiopia When I Was A Small Boy it Was there On Mbc4<br>whos From Africa And Rimmebers Friends My Mom used To Whach Friends And Me To Friends , Acording To Jim , Men , Fresh Prince Of Beler And More I Loved them
Watching them old is killing me
I think that would be nice make give another sensation to this kind of film, the laughs of the people in background even if it is a film it would fit well. :D
wow this actually came true
Ok first of all if chandler and Monica GET DIVORCED I might have to hurt someone I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s just to hard you know?
when they pass the world won’t be the same for me.
They changed everything.........watching friends right now and seeing everyone not in there rightfull place is horrible like where is Mike  why are Mon and chandler not married and what happened to Ben and Emma and ross and Rachel and why is Joey not himself what happened and what happened to Phoebe and her being a massager. I hate it but I still want the movie
I wonna cryyyyy😭😭😭❤️❤️
A few years too late but whatever
For the people who are thinking that it is real, its not the real trailer. And there is no trailer or anything out there sadly due to lockdown.
If there was a friends reunion they would know each other and phoebe is no doctor have you even seen friends
Läuft der Film schon oder ist der Kinostart wegen Corona noch nicht möglich gewesen?
i&#39;m crying man, i&#39;m really crying
OH MY GODDD!
I&#39;m not happy without seeing ross and rachel remarrying they did I think but not have an episode they should have🤧😭
Hi
Es mentira verdad o realmente si es un episodio real
This isn&#39;t real, is it?
Please make this movieeee🥺🥺
Music name
what is this srs
What were these scenes filmed for?
Now I&#39;m happy 😊😇
I LOVED MONICA AND CHANDLER TOGETHER D:
How come if chandler and monica were married why did they not remember eachother when they crashed
After the photo Insta, seeing the reunion after a long time....... So emotional
If this actually happened imma cry my eyeballs out
I can&#39;t wait for this<br><br><br><br><br>U know what they should make a serial, &quot;GROWN UPS&quot; after friends<br>With the same story line<br>Its gonna be amazing
The only one of the girls who looks still pretty is the one who did not do any plastic surgery. Phoebe looks great.
isso é maravilhoso de mais pra ser verdade!  estou arrepiada!
Only seeing this video gets me goose bumbs...
Honestly friends just brings back so much childhood memories of mine, how I wished the sitcom never ended 😢
i miss the laughing voice behind
Looks even worse than  the show
Is this rel??
when is it coming out
Won’t watch that crap.
Wait what is this??<br>Where&#39;s it from?
Me realizing 2020 it’s now:  😫😭🤯🥰😍🤩😻🙇🏼‍♀️
MONICA AND CHANDLER GOT DIVORCED?! WHAT THE FUCK! ALL MY RELATIONSHIPS WERE BASED ON THEIRS! WHY
Is it just me or do i think joey and rachel are a better couple?
Matt Leblanc is the only one who looks the same <br>Exception: grey hair.
Am crying 😢😢😢
HolyShit
I m not crying you are crying
If netflix became popular in 2005, it Would probably invest in this movie itself
Is this real? If not where are the clips from?
im crying like a baby
Omg I want to see :D
I know the movie&#39;s not happening but where did they get these clips? I&#39;m not updated cause i live in a cave.
And to think people dislike this
F•R•I•E•N•D•S
No,no,no,something is so wrong here...it&#39;s not that emotion,energy that we loved...
the isnt real is it
WHAT???  MONICA AND CHANDLER GETTING DIVORCED!!!  DEFINITELY NOT WATCHING THIS ONE
Ross don&#39;t aging wow
is this real?
Kb aaeygi ye reunion.... i have watched the whole season twice while waiting for Movie 😂
Surely it should be called &#39;Friends Reunited&#39; after the social media app?
This is just sad... This is just gonna ruin the memories I have... This is gonna be like that legend of Korra that ruined Avatar the last Airbender
This no shit made me cry 😭
When Joey and Ross hugged I felt that right there 😢
This made me cry 😢 I wish the show never ended
I don&#39;t understand - is this not a real trailer? Is this put together from other films or something? Because it looks a lot like properly made trailer. Huh?!
In case anyone is wondering where are all this scenes taken from: <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2737464/friends-mini-reunions/">http://www.mtv.com/news/2737464/friends-mini-reunions/</a>

All the scenes are from cougar towm and web therapy
... Excuse me but WHAT re-union? At a RETIREMENT home in Palm Springs or FL? Jennifer Anniston looks better than all. Matt LeBlank looks like he is 70yo. A friend on fb made a poster of the FRIENDS re-union poster and I agree that it should be called A-C-Q-U-A-I-N-T-A-N-C-E-S ... lol
Nunca fui tão iludida na vida
I hope that Ross and Rachel are married because if they don&#39;t i don&#39;t know what am I doing
It&#39;s so emotional 💔
My god that’s going to make me cry &amp; i hate that<br>I hate the fact i see theme getting older 💔
Not seeing ross and rachel together and not seeing emma kills me from the inside
Please don&#39;t. Leave FRIENDS alone. <br>Don&#39;t ruin it. Please. No
Why does this just kinda give me a depressing vibe?
POR FAVOR QUE ALGUIEN ME DIGA DE DONDE ES ESTO
PLEASE RELEASE IT

Awww I litally cried it&#39;s so sweet and heartwarming
what&#39;s the background music name
“IM FINE!😭”
i think it would be so much better if they did it more similar to fuller house. brighter colors, upbeat, but also moments that are emotional. let’s get netflix to do a series for friends.
When?
Is this real?
This is real? This movie? This trailer? Please say thats are not

This is just a few sitcoms thrown together
it&#39;s so weird how a reunion is really happening in 2020 and your title is 2020 but you posted this in 2018
They should have left it alone  . By making a movie they denigrated the friends
What is the title of the second music
This looks awful
what music is playing? tell me please
Well you aren&#39;t wrong<br>There having a reunion
It&#39;s 2020, and Emma&#39;s finally 18 :&#39;)

Its finally happening for real now
OMG yasssssss hopefully this happens?
Trailer song pls
Jen is so pretty!
These are all clips from a show called cougar town, starring Courteney Cox, but they brought in other actors/actresses from friends. The clip of Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer meeting again and hugging I&#39;m not sure what that&#39;s from, but unfortunately this is not true. POSSIBLY there will be an hour long interview with the cast in the Ellen show, but that&#39;s only a rumor.
Chandler and Monica ARE NOT MARRIED
Que sea verdad por favor no me mientan
I swear, if this is a movie, I will watch it every single night to fall asleep
Wait..... this isn’t real, right? Because Monica and Chandler is always gonna be together! 😭
they dont seem so happy as they used to be. why?
When？
Ai.meu.deus
AWWWWW!!!!! THIS NEEEDDS TO HAPPEN!!!!!
Wait is that real ?
Wait, Chandler and Monica are together, and Ross with Rachel
Idk Why But This made me cry
Omg ♥️🥺
Wait....<br>Was I the only one crying 😭?
E até hj....
Idk why I can&#39;t imgine friends in todays world, I mean the fashion, technology, and anything related... I&#39;m stuck in those old days...
This video doesn&#39;t give me nostalgic emotions at all. They seem more like strangers than close friends that they were many years ago.
I just cried 😭😭😭💖💖💖

I have an idea what if the movie would be about chandler and monica getting a divorce and rachel and ross having another kid,joey being on the top of his career, the life of phoebe and mike , and monica starts dating grayson, but monica realized that chandler is the love of her life and then they all have a reunion and stuff
OMGGGG I&#39;MMM SOOOOO SOOOOO HAPPY ❤😭
Наконец-то!!! Я реально кричу! Слава Богу!!! Это самое крутое что может быть на ТВ. Это просто бомба!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23%D0%BD%D1%8E%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8E%D1%88%D0%B0">#нюшатюша</a>
I&#39;m crying I wanna see the movie😭😭
Ai meu coração 😢😢❤️
Oh I&#39;m happy for there reunion but I&#39;m still hurting by seeing them apart from each other...ohh man I&#39;m crying 😭😭😭😭
how come any movie/show that is a sequel after many-years hiatus, there is always a divorce for the couple, never &quot;oh,  they had 2 kids and everybody is happy&quot;? Really, must everything go down the crapper? Systematically? i understand you can then show how they get together again but come on...
queria que fosse verdade
Quero outra seria simplesmente amo tudos eles como gostaria de ver eles juntos outra vez 😍😍😍😍😍
Wow me emocioné yo envejecí con ellos

Where are these clips from

Sonho
𝓘 𝓶𝓲𝓼𝓼 𝓯𝓻𝓲𝓮𝓷𝓭𝓼 𝓼𝓸 𝓶𝓲𝓬𝓱
Is this true??
holy shit this is some good editing
No la conosco perp parese buena
I think this video was made of clips from other films, the creators aren&#39;t that crazy to separe Monica and Chandler or something like that. And if the actors meet each other in the real life, in the movie is very difficult that they are all separated. That&#39;s only my opinion! 😉
I think a movie where they all reunite (without Monica and Chandler being divorced and Rachel and Ross being separated) is not something we want. It&#39;s something we literally need.
Hope they do reunite
God....I&#39;ve fallen for this like 4 times...
I&#39;m from the future...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Jk
Why didn&#39;t this happen im from 2020
Is this real
Ai caralho eu to chorando
I cried myself to sleep when this didn&#39;t get made.
Imagine if this was real...😭
Igual me ilusione:(
I will be in hell just to see a film
Laier
Lol
Monica has gotten some botox tho
Well this is weird
Oooo my god 😇 writing the re- unite can&#39;t wait😂😂😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘
I refuse to watch this crap if Monica and Chandler, Ross and Rachel aren’t together.
Is this real
