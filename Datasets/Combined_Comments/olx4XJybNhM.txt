why fuckin hell do you need to count your finger man like cmon
This aged like fine wine 😂

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olx4XJybNhM&amp;t=456">7:36</a> ana hahahaha😂
Why are you copying SSSniperwolf? She sucks.
wow this game takes me back. flash game from early 2000&#39;s. I missed 3 questions the first time I played, I was quite drunk though. 4 quarts in a cup. that one can be guessed from context. The first time i heard &quot;quart&quot; my brain made it &quot;quarter&quot;
at least felix admits to stealing... unlike someone else in this video
WATCHING THIS IN 2023 WITH ALL THE SSNIPERWOLF DRAMA MAKES THIS VIDEO SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST A MASTERPIECE PEWDS IS  A GENUIS
The word SWIMS is SMIWS backwards. How was that correct ?
Yoo we have the same birthday month

Apparently Felix and I share the same Birthday Month. BIG PP!!!!
zero deaths!
I love how i was on shorts and i saw ssniperwolf because it was shown and i thought.... ah. That may be an ok channel if pewdiepie is talking about it. Then i searched ssniperwolf and this video was first before any ssniperwolf ones XD

2+2=4
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olx4XJybNhM&amp;t=372">6:12</a> I am in tears at. Brain very large
PewDiePie remember when you said the two and two you were wrong it&#39;s not 22 it&#39;s four 2 + 2 is 4 because you don&#39;t know
As of now, PewDiePie have the same Million subscribers as the number of questions in the test.
some of these are just incorrect. for example swims is not the same backwards, forwards and upside down. backwards is smiws
I&#39;m a fan of Mr beast and you

111M subs and 111 questions! such a quinsedence!

My favorite color is also anal
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olx4XJybNhM&amp;t=720">12:00</a> nuckles didn&#39;t lie, you counted 5+3 because one hand all knuckles and other hand 3, but you forgot that you don&#39;t count your thumb&#39;s nuckle so it&#39;s 4+3=7, not 8
What gets me the most is the question about how many months have 28 days
that wasnt the metric system
Wtf is the knuckle test?

<b>adjusts glasses</b><br>Akhtually, the pope is not Catholic. The person we call the pope is officially called the head of the bishop of rome, vicer of Jesus Christ, the successor of the prince of the apostoles, supreme pontiff of the universal church, the primate of italy, archbishop, metropolitan of the sovereign state, servant of the servants of god.<br><br>The <i>actual</i> pope is the pope of the Orthodox church of Alexandria. His real title is the Pope of Alexandria and the patriarch of all Africa on the holy sea of Saint Marcus, the apostle.<br><br>So TL;DR:<br>The one we call the pope is not the pope and the one who is the pope is not a roman Catholic.

February has 28 days. But the thing is, every four years, on the leap year, there’s 29th February, also known as, Mayday. It’s the day when May, a young girl with the power to grant wishes had died. This is the day children make wishes and celebrate as a holiday, supposedly. If you are confused, to be precise, one year consists of 365.242... days, not just 365 days. So we take that left bit of days and every four years, on the leap year, thus creating an extra day slotted into February, as the 29th. Btw, there are 7 months in a year that has 31days!👌
For no 4 I use the backward method by 13-4=9, 9x2/3=6..and in Asia(Singapore 4 me) — — = + (minus minus is plus). I think this easiest test ever is mainly easy if you are straightforward and don’t think to much, or second guess yourself: basically, if you are someone who thinks a lot, you probably tend to think too much and get it wrong.
