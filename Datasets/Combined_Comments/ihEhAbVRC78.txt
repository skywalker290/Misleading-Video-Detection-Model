why did all the tech youtubers turn against curved displays when they were previously fans of them?
Love watching these old reviews and seeing how far things have come
I found a random note 9 what should I do with it
S24 released, time to buy the Note 9 now
Who still got this one in 2024?👋
Held out for the S24 Ultra
its February 2024, still the best phone ever equipped with iris scanner.
2024 my last year with note 9 . wouldve continued using but i lost the power button and the back glass is  a mess and more or less the same situation for the front screen . been my daily driver fr 5 years . time to say good bye . just ordered  s24 ultra
One issue I can&#39;t resolve. When using Bluetooth, incoming phone will ring once. ( only) AUTO Answer .  Doesn&#39;t ring a 2nd time or go to v voice-mail. <br>Person is active listening to my verbal without me knowing they are online.<br>It does ring normal  # times and voice-mail works when Bluetooth is  Off.
This was my last Android device and I’m so happy to ditch the so very fragile curved display 🤷🏻‍♂️
I&#39;m writing this in February 2024 and I still have this note 9. I love my note 9.
This is one of the best phones I ever ever owned !
I love this phone❤
Beautiful watching this 2024
I&#39;m using the note 9 in 2024 and it&#39;s still going strong lol
lol
Note 9 user in 2024..
Finally about to upgrade my Note 9 for an S24 Ultra.
It&#39;s January 2024 and I&#39;m still using this beast!😊
Who&#39;s here this January 2024?
It&#39;s Nov 2023 and I&#39;m still rocking mine. Can&#39;t find a reason to upgrade when the phone basically just works. <br>P.S. I have the special Casey Neistat version
Its 2024, still using this as my daily driver!
2023 and still in love with this device
still using this phone in late 2023, still snappy. hardly any complaints, thr battery is a little lackluster, possibly due to degradation from 3 years of heavy use (i got it in 2020) but other than that I don&#39;t even feel like upgrading
I&#39;m replying in 2023 that I have decided to get this phone.  I appreciate the info.
Still using it.
Is this note 9 still worth buying now?
Damn Note 9 is great on its time indeed
Still using this daily in October 2023 ... 4 years on and I can&#39;t find a single reason to change it.  One of the things I like is a wired headphone, I&#39;m no fan of Bluetooth buds, plus I can add memory ... what&#39;s not to like.<br><br>Why have they dropped these features now anyway?!!
Could someone give provide Spotify link to intro music  . Thanks in advance🎉
It&#39;s 2023, my note 9 has just dropped the height of two floors, I replaced the screen and it&#39;s good as new. Besides still being the total package, it&#39;s durable af. Best phone I ever had.
I bought this in 2019 and just in a couple of months it got stolen... I still miss it
Update: Iam from 2023. This was peak smartphone design.
You can get it now for 350 bucks with 512gb, get it guys, best phone ever and if you want a cheap-ish flagship, now it ur chance
Using it in 2023!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Still a Beast!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Update: I switched to The Z flip 5
Anyone else watching this for the Nostalgia? This device was such a beast.
2023, still a daily driver, bought new in box 512Gb for under 500$ in 2020. Noble rom only drawback the the heart rate sensor no longer usable, and the iris scanner, but i have glasses anyway
August 06, and I&#39;m still using my note 8
Her King
Still using this phone!<br>Everything is buttersmooth.<br>Just the battery health deteriorated overtime. Though still getting 4hours of SOT.<br>One of the greatest phone ever!<br>I think if I replace the battery, I can go another 4years!!
Just bought one for the third time and i still love it
Hi Marquees, <br><br>I bought the Note 9 after watching your review and I&#39;ve absolutely loved it especially the camera quality?<br>I&#39;m now ready to buy a new phone and I  thought of you?<br>What&#39;s your latest recommendation and favorite phone?<br>I hope you are doing well ❤
Rocking this phone for 4 years .  Cracked screen a bit but its strong and im timid to get a newer note .  I dont know if its worth it for the 5g upgrade .
July 2023 im still loving my note9
does it check now even? 2023!
Youtube: oh you can now afford the s9
using an iPhone 7 rn. halfway into 2023 and im planning to get the Note 9. still plenty fast and far cheaper than it used to be. its excellent value for money honestly, even now.
S10 or not 9 which one I should buy 👌🏻
in 2023 everybody is buying a 1400 $ iphone says &quot;who gives a shit it´s an iphone&quot; ;-(
5 pillars of Islam :D haha
Watching it on my NOTE 9 in 30 March, 2023 6:33:21 AM. <br>PAKISTAN STANDARD TIME.
Still a great phone in 2023... I wish Samsung never released the software update that caused the green screen issue.
I will say, even in 2023, if there was a phone with modern specs, display tech and increased battery capacity, but the exact same body as the Note 9, I would buy it. I think the idea of having small top and bottom bezels to hold something like stereo speakers or something would be nicer than having the bezels go up to the edges.
S23 announced means cheaper old phone
Know what? I have been using s23 ultra for more than a week now and i must say it was like cheating on my old note 9....love it to the date...havent had any scratches ...works just fine...and every now and then i just check in my note for old times sake...it was an affair...
How much?
i literally just bought one of these used lol
Going on 5 years with mine works better than the newest iphone lmao
hey are you related with Justin Brownlee? haha
only reason for me to buy this in 2023 is the display, curved edges looks insanely good
I bought the note 9 for $100. Quite happy.
I always wanted to use this Samsung Note 9, I can&#39;t believe I found on for under 100$. If only Samsung had software updates like iPhone, would have picked it up.
I&#39;m on my s22 ultra rn <br>This review is what got me into Samsung&#39;s ecosystem <br>The note 9 was a beaaaast
Here it is Nov 2022 and I just got one in silver that looks and works like new for $206
I&#39;m from the Future: The Note is killed!
Note series produces one of the best phone in the market period. :d
It&#39;s November 2022 and I just bought a reconditioned Note 9 for $200.00. In silver. Looks and acts like new. I bought one on sale in 2018 at Best Buy for $400, but dropped it and broke the screen as soon as I got it. Still works like new though.
Still the best phone I&#39;ve ever owned
Any one bought it in 2022?
hey good night quick question I got a note 9 every time it gets low for example I&#39;m playing a song and I take out my a pen it gets low what cause that ????
$300 today and i lov  it using 2022.
How did you get 16.2 milliion subscribers? Shout out to you. Congrats!!
2022, still using it 😅😅
Watching this video after 4 years
Note 20 sold to buy note 8
Note 9 still the best.
Note 9 has everything you need. Been using this for 4 years now and it&#39;s still running strong!
Note 20 announced time to but note 9
Just about to upgrade to an S20 ultra. I still love the S9 and I&#39;m not a fan of keeping up with the latest phones
2022, you still watching this video.  You&#39;re a legend
Sep 2022... still using note 9 without any issues... love my note
i rather get one unlocked that way i can use it with any service for $389.99 at My World Phone
still miss the Note9. upgrade to an S21Ultra and still miss that phone.
Im using note 9. IT FREAKING SENT ME A NOTI SAYING THAT MY PHONES BATTERY IS DETERIORATING
I am sending this comment to two well-known reviewers and technicians. Both of you have reviewed the Samsung Note9 and given it high praise. But to my knowledge, neither of you mentioned the display issues users were experiencing in this as well as the later Galaxy S-series, about 2-3 years after the Note9’s release. I would like both of you to correct this oversight. It is currently unclear if Samsung has continued the free display replacement they started in response to the issues a LOT of “out of warranty” customers were experiencing. And now these phones are finding their way into and through the Amazon Renewed program. I know this because I received not one, but two with the same issue! The second was supposed to be the first one’s replacement.<br><br>The issue I experienced was exactly the same on both devices. The screen would go dark, it would take time for the display to come up, and when it did it was a greenish tint, faded, with lines through it, and displayed items would lag or not draw correctly on screen, causing a ghosting effect. It occurred mostly during camera use on one device, and seemed to be triggered during the updating process of its replacement. It took me all of 5 minutes to find an article on Google talking about this. But I scheduled a walk-in with a Samsung Service Center and the guy behind the desk, as well as the guy he kept referring to behind the glass in another room, knew nothing about the issue or Samsung’s free display replacement program.<br><br>Could both of you investigate this issue and do a video calling Samsung to account for an obvious hardware flaw? Going hand-in-glove with this is Xfinity’s lack of disclosure as to what phones exactly are compatible with their service. That’s why I went with the Amazon Renewed Note9. It was the best but least expensive option. I was told this would work with their plan, and it did. But Comcast refuses to provide a clear and comprehensive list, and all I have discovered so far is that late model Samsungs and Googles are the only phones which work. This could be the topic of another video you both could do, helping users navigate the Xfinity’s mess and discover any loopholes in usable phones that may exist. I was perfectly happy with the LG G7 ThinQ, but this phone would not work on Xfinity’s service, and I was told some of the cheaper options, like the older A-series Samsungs, would also not work. It would be nice to have someone provide a final, definitive answer to a question many users, including myself are asking.<br><br>Thank you both for your time.
probably best note ever
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=220">3:40</a> at this point how do you find this music😁😆 , i know the song name if u need this😉

It&#39;s June 6th 2022. I want a new phone. The Legion Duel 2 released 2021, has a useful front 44 megapixel for work, and built in cooling to enjoy Diablo Immortal (Beta) for long stretches&#39; of time. However, I&#39;m reading that it no longer receives security updates according to people complaining on the forums only a year later. The 512GB variant costs 1000 USD ish. I just stumbled on a Note 9 for sale with copper body. Snapdragon 845 (2.8Ghz speed), 512 Gb Rom, SPen, SDcard, and a headphone jack. The note 9 screen is still a 2k screen where many newer models are only 1080p.  and has a 4000 Ma battery. Oh, and Samsung just released a security update in May 2022 for the Note 9.  I&#39;m looking at all this for sale now at 279 USD. This is weird for me as an early adopter ...but I think I&#39;m about to buy a 5 year old phone.
I&#39;m still using the note 9 in 2022 as it is the most powerful Samsung Galaxy phone that does not have a tear drop, punchole or notch camera ( to date )
I have had my note 8 for 5 years and it still last 2 days
anyone here still use this? it’s 2022 and i really want to buy this phone but it would be nice to get some input
2022 still beast
Still rocking from 2019 works flawless
Still watching
pls Send me Note 9 but i don&#39;t have money  love you
I&#39;m thinking about getting this phone soon, thanks for the review! Super helpful
Bro your video is awesome.....<br>But with English subtitle it&#39;s perfect .
Who&#39;s using these things without a case??? They are soooo slippery, I still drop phones even with case.
Still using it and going strong
still a great phone over 3 years later. I&#39;m coming back to this video because I&#39;m gonna have to say goodbye to my note 9 sadly. I&#39;m trading it in for a s22 ultra, and while it will be better, I&#39;ll miss the feel of the note 9. And the perfect fingerprint placement on the back. Not to mention the headphone jack :/ It served me well, now I have to say goodbye:(
2022 who&#39;s watching
Still have this phone 512gb 8gb ram unfortunately im upgrading to the s22 ultra 512gb
Nice jobs,thanks share
Its april of 2022 and I&#39;m still using this great phone
Form 2022 🔥🔥🔥🔥
💯💯
Only I love stevejobs I love apple 🍎 but u really good awesome men 💕👍🔥
At 1.47 you can see the cutting device.<br>Showing that they want to CUT people.
just picked one up as of 2/23/22
Feb. 2022 and waiting for my pre-ordered S22 Ultra. Note 9 will still be THE best phone I&#39;ve ever used, lasting 3.5 years, I&#39;m definitely gonna miss it.
Still using Note 9 2022
2022, still using my note 9! Has everything I need.
It’s February 2022, I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max and I just bought one of these on eBay just to have it. I got one when they first came out and wish I’d have kept it.
It’s Feb 2022 still my phone , I am in love with this phone 🙏🤙🥰
Its 2022 and I&#39;m finally moving on from this phone, it was everything and more that I wanted. It still holds pretty good against some of the big hitters but now is my time to move on, I will miss you Note 9.
February 2022 my Note 9s w/ 512 internal &amp; 512 SD card storage is still going strong but..... I pre-ordered the Samsung Galaxy Ultra 22 with 1TB storage yesterday. Finally time to make the upgrade. Again, Note 9s are still going strong. I have 2 of them but retiring the one for personal use. The one for work stays in the rotation 👌🏾
S22 just launched but I&#39;m sticking with this Note 9 until I run it into the ground. 3 years old but the battery is still going strong for some reason. Samsung made this phone so good that they had to remove features from the next versions.
If there was a phone I’d want to see re-released with updated specs, this is it!
GL
Had this phone since 2018, but then I dropped it in the toilet at the start of 2022 (not as water resistant as I thought). Now I’m using an iphone 13. I wanna go back to android 😭
2022 and i still buy s9 note
February 2022 still using it...
Lost my note9 then found it yesterday a good phone use it for my sim only deal.
January &#39;22 still using it 🤣🤣🤣 waiting for the S22 Ultra
Discontinued this  .... iPhone is better now .
I think having a headphone jack should be a pillar
I just bought this device for business, my iPhone 13 pro max is my personal and it stacks up pretty well against it
Note 9 will be the best phone Samsung ever made ...The display is still better than any display ever made
It&#39;s January 2022 and  I am missing this phone. I don&#39;t know why but..😖😄
Literally had the iPhone 7 for a year and my dad gave me his old note 9 around the same time… maybe I should take it out and use that instead…
It&#39;s December 2021 and I&#39;m still rocking this Note 9...still works great and the display still looks wonderful..haven&#39;t had a reason to upgrade. Might get S22 in early 2022 tho 😅
Name of the game in the video
Sucks it won&#39;t get android 11.  All  $1k phones deserve 3 to 5 year  upgrade as a perk. Budget crap phones get android 11. Wtf
Still using mine, although I just got a Z Fold 3 today havent unboxed it yet
Brilliant phone
I have the s8+ atm and was interested in the note, but knowing it has a fixed Bixby button is a hard, hard no and it is dumb founding that it cannot be rebound. Idiotic decision by Samsung.
2018<br>Note 9 - 512GB <br>iphone - 64GB<br><br>2021 <br>Note 21 - NA<br>iPhone - 1TB<br><br>COME ON SAMSUNG!!
No notch and has a 3.5 jack. Note 9 will be my last samsung device just for those reason.
Note9 user here since 2019!<br>Damn this phone is the best!.<br>I haven&#39;t needed to upgrade at all yet.<br><br>Im a little tempted with thr S21 series but im not yet convinced enough to leave this phone.<br>Its just so good. (heck, i&#39;d rather refurbish this phone than buy a new model)
Great phone 📱 Definitely one of the best smartphones of the last 5 years 👏👏
How much is this in naira
The best Note. Sad that it never got better than this.
I&#39;m actually watching this on a note 9. The screen colors are great but I have an annoying problem with the black color which looks like little bit awkward
Bruhhh I&#39;m supposed to be getting one for Christmas and this helped alot :(
I just bought a refurbished lavender colored Samsung Galaxy Note 9 from Back Market for 350 I believe
Just got mine in October 2021
Please does anybody has tips on how to get the new 3.1UI based Android 11 on the Samsung Note 9 ?
I might be a bit late, but Im still using the Note3 from when I watched your review 7 years ago. I just bought the Note9 today because of your review. Thank you.
I&#39;m currently using the note 9 and I still love it. It&#39;s funny how he said it&#39;s expensive. Here we are in 2021 and phones are costing $2,000 and $3,000
Linus still using this!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=59">0:59</a>
2021 I’m planning on getting one
512GB storage still good in 2021.
I&#39;m using my Note 9 for 2,5 years. It still works very well. I&#39;m definitely satisfied / 17 september 2021
ahhh those were the golden days....
I still want this phone
chotkiy tel bu
How much would this baby cost by now?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=217">3:37</a> he dumb for that 🤣🤣🤣
its 2021 but im definitely switching my iPhone for this phone
It’s sad that it’s become about having or not having a headphone jack 😒 I’m glad I’ll be moving back to an Android based phone… with a head jack .. F U APPLE!🙄
I bought this phone..<br>Happy as. 8gig ram, 512gig storage. In a phone.. laptop in my pocket..
Sad, I know but I still have my Note 9.  I love it.
@MKBHD I have the Note 9. Should I upgrade to Note 20 or S21 Ultra?
The note 8 had a option for single hand mode
Is it good to buy it in 2021? for a price of 280 euros
Can I have that Note9?
I am having from last 3 years😍love it
Headphone jack, iris scanner, notification led, s pen on the right, no camera bump, no punchole/notch, pressure sensitive home button, expandable storage, etc.<br><br>The Note 9 still beats phones of the current generation. Truly the last great Samsung flagship ever. Proves that newer isn&#39;t always &#39;better&#39; :)
It&#39;s July 2021 and I&#39;m still using this, this device is a beast
Got one like new today for 200 dollars complete with accessories and box from fb marketplace. Only missing is Android 11! 2 years of support is ridiculous
Who gets this in recommended for no reason even after watching it years ago 😂
I realize this vid is 2 years old, but he botched his review. <br>Note 9 has a &quot;one-handed feature.&quot;
This phone is perfect!! ;)
How much does it cost today. Im sorry but i cant find the price.
512 8 fantatic, love mine, not overly impressed by the camera but what a phone!
My dream is using a Galaxy note 9
No cell phone is worth a thousand dollars.
Thats my phone
The clammy floor evidently last because connection really unpack plus a innocent cotton. dull, remarkable speedboat
Watching this using my Samsung Note 9 😄
just bought at 1/3 of its value 2 years later .
Well just broke my iPhone 6s, glad I finally have a reason to switch to Samsung
Watching this in 2021 and the phone looks so old...
Just picked one up today and absolutely amazing compared to my iPhone 7 lol 2021 I can say this note 9 is a beast especially the model I got which is 512gb like Jesus talking bout storage its the hellcat of phones
this is my first android and I LOVE it!!!!
I’m late but I’m getting that phone
Watching this on my Note 9 right now. It&#39;s the best phone I&#39;ve ever owned.
Watching on my note 8
nice review..
I&#39;m getting  8 hours
speakers in the same place as before? note 8 was not stereo speakers but i guess they are in the same place
Still thinking if im gonna get a note 10 plus or wait a bit for note 20 ultra.<br>Watching on my note 9 hehe
The last best phone Samsung have ever made. Headphone jack, expandable memory, iris scanner,premium glass design,full Samsung pay support, QHD display, headphone and charger included in the box. Everyone was happy and suddenly they started following Apple.🤮
Linus is still using it.
fuckin hell that intro blew my ears out
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=398">6:38</a> Cadey Mercury, nice
Just saw one in a local store for 50 dollars but I&#39;m not so sure about the price, wish me luck when I take a closer look
i am still using this guy but i have exynos variant <br>so it is the problem<br>but i love this phone
2021 ? Best note ever
Just got one as a hand-me-down, having not used a premium device before because I use my PC for everything. Enjoying it so far, and great for my large hands.
Gosh when this brick 🧱  falls on me face at 1AM 🦷 X_X .
Just bought this in March 2021. Still top phone. Also because new Notes don&#39;t have 3.5mm jack.
I don&#39;t like they way you guys do videos nowadays, you write the same thing you say under the video, it block my view and I can&#39;t see some things well in the video, I already hear and understand what you are saying so why writing it to block some views. I really don&#39;t like this style. Is it a new YouTube policy?
Can I grab you note nine
Note 9 was good, time to upgrade. Goodbye my friend.
Me when I got tue Note 9, 2 years ago. <br>&quot;My phone is superior biiitch&quot;<br><br>Present: &quot;Please don&#39;t bully me&quot;
This phone is legit 100% <b>RECOMMENDED</b> :)
The last true note 🙌🙌
Black and Yellow 💎🔑
its 2021 and im watching this on my note 9 🤣
once my father dropped a brick on his note 9, only the screen broke, thought is would have shattered but nope. true story
Where is note 9 users? Hit like 👍
My note 9 get really hot after 5min of normal web browsing usage. Happen after I sent in for repair of the battery expanding and pop the back cover cover half open. Maybe they forgot to put the heatsink or replace it.
Hawdy, Howdy! I have a question 🙋🏼‍♀️ : how can I recognize a fake “ Samsung Galaxy Note 9 “ from a real one? I came upon one other video that was warning people of a lot of fake cheaply made Chinese cell phones. Do you have such a video? Thank you! I appreciate all the good info! ☺️
Note 20 announced. Time to buy a note 9.
Here in February 2021, $1000 phones are the norm now thanks to Apple...
It&#39;s time to buy the former flagship phone
When samsung cared...
I&#39;m going to buy it for this year 2021

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=332">5:32</a> game name ?
Making me like all the phones that you review.😂
Using the note 9 in 2021
Bixby is the most annoying feature ever!!!!!!
I owned this phone for two years and the battery is now sucking ass. Used to last around 30 hours even with normal use. Now it won&#39;t last more than a few hours. It&#39;s nuts how it just basically started and this was after the Android 10 update. Suspicious Samsung. Remember when Apple was caught doing this?
Is the phone worth buying in 2021?,how is its battery life
I am poor just got my note 9🥰🥰🥰🥰 i love it!!!
Oh no the flashbacks of Black and Yellow 2011
Marques, you should make the resolution of your videos the same as the phone you&#39;re reviewing. That would be pretty cool
this is sign for me to buy this, thank you YouTube algorithm
Impression on 2021?
what camera are you using to shoot this video?
Watching from my Note 9! I am loving it in 2021.
There wasn&#39;t a Note 9 Plus?
Still can&#39;t afford it 😭😂
I bet you didn&#39;t know this phone has a heartbeat  pulse sensor on the back of the phone next to the  LED. And it works very well. You can access it with Bixby or in samsung health application.  It so cool
Very very great beast samsung galaxy note 9
the REAL final Note.
I’m here in 2021 and still love my Note 9
Is the note 9 still good?
had the note9 for almost 2 years now, best phone
Why Am I Watching this Almost 3 year&#39;s old phone in my note 9 ?
waited till 2020 to buy the 2.5UI note 9 at $255 is still freaking amazing!!!!! refined dex as well how can you go wrong with this phone! spend you 1.5k-2k $ on the new flagship, this dude can hang with them no problemo
2 years later, still a beast.
I totally agree with you man. I love my SGN9. Mine has 500 GB storage + 512GB SD card. A whopping 1 terabyte storage!
see what you did there 😂
End of 2020 and still using this beast it was worth $1000 tag 👌 waiting to upgrade to note 21 or maybe rog 4 when it comes out !!
Who else is watching this on their note 9
Best phone I&#39;ve ever had. Never freaked out on me unlike other brands. Looking to save up for the Note 20 ultra.
I am wishing to take this phone... What is your opinion??
Just bought this phone last week . No regrets !!!
Give us improvement ideas on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.<br>So we create something very HUGE.
Just bought a refurbished one on amazon for 350. Hope it works well
Note always my best phone
Sometimes all you need is a good game of catch with your dad.<br>Field of Dreams is streaming now on Peacock.
I’m just switching to android for the Samsung pen
Watching it on my... NOTE 4!   The only reason I am looking at something beyond my phone is it&#39;s filled up and I cannot install 2-3 additional apps
Watching this on my note 9
note 9 in 2020 is it worth?
The last good note.<br>Sad
How did you do that with the camera? Making it change size
Hello Brother..<br> can you give me please an android phone for my education purposes

Who is after note 20ultra is released
Watching it on 2nd hand note 9. I am falling in love.

Bias I sense
I Bought It on Release day and after 27 days I broke the screen in pocket .... Got it Replaced after a few month for 250 dollars and still using it with absolutely zero complains and I am a power user , I am pretty sure it will run awesome for the next 2 years as well !
Lol i have 12 gigs of ram in my 10+ and 256 internal  these phones are spec beasts for sure
You should do a review of DeX
Everybody: OMG, I can&#39;t wait for the Note20 Ultra to arrive!<br>Me: Perfect time to get a Note9 for $350.
Just bought mine used 450 dollars 512 gb model
You think I should still buy the note 9.. do a 2020 review about it...
Note 20 dropped time to buy the note 9
coming from a droid turbo 2 im thinking this will be a sweet sub $500 upgrade for me. this phone seems to get rave reviews with ppl referring to features it has that newer models dont. i opted for the 512gb version.  should be here in a few days.
Still my daily, still a beast, still tops 80/90% of the new phones in 2020.
Can you believe that I&#39;m on note 3?....getting the note 9 would be a huge step up for me.... also Can someone tell me if I get a note 9 would there be a need to purchase a go pro to do vlogs?
Coronavirus hm.....😔😔
N 20 ultra announced; time to buy n9 or 10!
2050 anyone???
Note 20 is out...now i can afford note 9
I am going to buy a this phone tomr.
It&#39;s October, pandemic time, 2020. The iPhone 12 series is finally about to be announced. I&#39;ve been looking forward to this for months. Then suddenly last night, I found this nice &quot;refurbished&quot; but reportedly in &quot;like new condition&quot; ocean blue Galaxy Note 9 online. I always wanted one (And I&#39;m not even a Samsung person, or a big phone person) but I just couldn&#39;t afford it. So as crazy as this feels at this point (but since there&#39;s just something about this phone that is really special, even to this day) I think I&#39;m finally getting it. Better late than never, right?! It&#39;s like treating yourself one day with a  wonderful-all time favorite-classic car of your dreams. Cheers. :)
Do u get headphones whit it when getting it from amazon
I bought the note 9 after the note 20 ultra was released in 2020 almost 3 years later😂
Seriously, I&#39;ve been in bestbuy and verizon and I&#39;ve checked out the Note 20 ultra, and I honestly don&#39;t feel compelled to upgrade. I just don&#39;t feel its worth it
Yeah, finally affordable:)
“It’s 2018, why not push the limit?” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Had mine two years this past August. Looking to a Microsoft surface duo! Should I ?
yeah this phone is great and all, but does it have more protection than Nokia? hahaha.
I&#39;m gonna get this phone
I can afford this phone on 2022.
watching for nostalgia
Watching this on my Note 20 Ultra, feeling Hella nostalgic.
Watching this on my Note 9, 2 years later. An absolute  unit of a phone. Still works smoothly, fast, can handle nearly anything you throw at it, etc. Worth getting!
note 20 has released. Time to buy this phone
This phone has double the storage than my pc
Stupid crappy phone!
note 20 announced time to buy note 9
Is it water proof
I bought this phone 2 years ago with the 520 GB Storage. I still have 3 payments left. I get about 7 hours screen on time. The battery only lost 8% capacity of the original 4,000 mAh after 2 years heavy usage. I&#39;m on a grandfather Verizon unlimited data plan so I use about 50 gb of data per month so I&#39;m impressed the battery only lost 8% in almost 2 years. I had insurance on it which I used to replace the phone recently because the charging port was not allowing me to consistently fast charge at 1,000 ma and higher. It would drop down to 400 ma and then go back up and then down, etc. Well the replacement phone arrived and the battery had 98% of its original 4,000 mAh capacity. So basically I&#39;m good for another 2 years. my next phone will be the Galaxy Fold 2. I&#39;m on the early waiting list. If I can sell my Note 9 520 GB for $500 and buy the Fold 2 on 2 year plan for $1,500 it will probably make sense since that phone will hold excellent value from low supply in the market.
Note 20 ultra announced<br>Time to buy note 9
Note 20 comes out <br>Time to buy a note 9
Bro, note 9 in 2020 review please
This or the asus rog
I like that Razer Blade in the background
The  best phone I&#39;ve purchased! Watch the video and you&#39;ll see what I mean.
Man this was the first phone to really make me go, &quot;holy crap, it&#39;s perfect.&quot; I remeber that exact feeling I got when fist watching this. No phone has gotten that same feeling for me since.  Its been exactly 2 years since this review came out for me.
Sure It real. I got a new Samsung galaxy  S10  from collierspro2 on Instagram.
This was truly the last real Samsung Note. No Notch, packed out with all the senors (Iris, HR monitor), headphone jack etc. It is a utility phone not an S series phone... If anything to should retain the bezels to pack better speakers and senors etc into the phone and it certainly should not have an obstructed screen. This is the Thinkpad of phones!
Still using note 9 since launch, still perfect.
Note 20 released. Now that its a $200 phone, ill buy it.
After 2 years it is still a $1000 phone even after launch of note 10 and note 20
Came back to this after the Note 20 disappointment. When the Note was not divided, and the Note was actually the best of the best. But now, there is a &quot;Note&quot; and a &quot;Note, but worse&quot;...
note 20 ultra announced. time to get the note 9
Samsung : Announced note 20 ultra<br><br><br><br>Youtube : Wanna check note 9  ??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=117">1:57</a> There&#39;s a option that if enabled, if you tap the home button 3 times it will turn on &quot;one handed mode&quot;. But again, for the 3 times press to work, that feature needs to be enabled in the settings.
My dad is buying a new note 20 so his 1 year old note 9 will be mine
I&#39;ve had this phone for almost 2 years now and damn it&#39;s still powerful as hell, and I think by far the most perfect design for Samsung Note series (compared to Note 10 and Note 20) is Note 9! Also I have never put casing on my phone and it often flew across my bedroom to the ground, and not even a single scratch! Yeah I just love my phone and I wanted to share it
Hey Marques<br>Why not do a speaker comparison with the Note 9  Note 10 and Note 20 ultra. Would be interesting to hear the improvement if any????
now you can get the note 9 for 400 USD brand new on amazon
Sir is there any way to solve samsung yellow tint problem
Well i am watching this after i used the note 9 and broke it p.s: using a freakin iPhone 6
It&#39;s worth it , even now when the note 20 ultra&#39;s out!
This 2 year old phone is selling for around $400 on swappa now. There is a few in mint condition.
note 9 &gt; note 20 all day hahahaha in fact 20 series is the worst overpriced junk ever if in the exynos zone
Its currently $380 on Amazon renewed...I&#39;m considering it
I got this phone today from my brother. He got the new One Plus. But I will still be using iPhone 7 outside my home.
Got the note 9 for 250 in 2020. Best phone ever. They better keep it updated!
right now u can get the note 9 for like 400 bucks, so yeah,if you want a phone right now or u r feeling like ur phone is getting a bit old, run for it
I got big hands and fingers so I need a big phone for me. That’s just me 🤷‍♀️
can you do a 2020 review bro??
After almost 2 years of watching this video, I&#39;m finally able to afford this phone (2nd hand)!!
I miss note9.
What do you think about this one in 2020
Super 👌 😄 👌
It&#39;s 2020 and the Note 9 is still my daily driver, love the headphone jack, no display notch and stylus :)
Best phone ever made
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=373">6:13</a> that’s where I am gonna go for my birthday!
I just got one for 380€. I can&#39;t imagine a better phone for the price.
Bought this monster galaxy note 9 (used) few days ago for about RM1,370.00 ($330).<br><br>I would say, it is worth every penny!!<br>I&#39;m loving it.<br><br>No problem so far
The note 9 is Boss
rip my note 4. it was a long beautiful ride. only issue i ever had with my note 4 was this recent issue with it not reading sim cards anymore.  The note 8 looks to be a suitable replacement tho.
Literally just bought it today for $200 🙃😫 note gang forever .. back to galaxy I go 🌌
Why tf am I watching this almost 2 years later on my Note 9..
Isnt there a one-hand feature on this one?
2020
I bought Galaxy note 9 in November 2018, and still I love it like crazy, and I won&#39;t give it for note 10 plus and even note 20
How much is the price of Galaxy Note 9 and note 10
Note 9 has 5G <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=67">1:07</a>
What theme and icon he used?
Yes Marques we see what you did there.😂🤣😂
I&#39;ve had no reason to change from this phone and I&#39;m really not a fan of in screen camera punch-outs.
It&#39;s a brilliant device. Still going strong in mid 2020.
Wishing to have Note9
I still rock this phone. Great Bluetooth audio and headphone jack. Battery life... Not so good.

I just bought my brand new Note 9 for under $500
I&#39;m tempted to get the note 9 for $420.00
waiting for the note 20 to drop so i can buy the note 9
Wow you have the samsung note 9 bro can you buy me my phone broje because my brothe put it in the water and it died i using my sister phone but my account plz bro i need a new phone plz
Awesome, I buy high end smartphones a year or two after release. You are not just the best mobile reviewer in the world but more importantly the most honest.
I LOVE MY NOTE 9. UPGRADED FROM NOTE 4. NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE IN SPEED.
Too much money now is 400ish on swappa
Planning to get an iphone. My note9 is always freezing! This is my second samsung that got slow after 2 years! Tired of buying phone every 2 years. My wife&#39;s iphone se still works perfectly.
Watching this in 2020 and planing to get it on Amazon renewed rather than a budget phone
this was the perfect mobile <br>simple yet brilliant
I have some yellowish/ greenish lines on my display now,, anyone know what actually is the reason ?.. how to fix it ? Such a waste of money for such expensive phone and still not durable for couple of year..
For those who got this for $400 or less in 2020 whats your battery health? Mines 95% in pristine condition from MMP
Yep! I still have it . .I&#39;m still using it. .no issues so far...compared to the new ones 👍🤟🤟mine is heavier has fingerprints scanner and eye scanner too still fast ...
May 21, 2020.<br>My daily driver is my Note 9 (6 GB RAM, 128 GB ROM) that I bought in November 2018.<br>Included in the box was a 512 GB SD card from Samsung. <br>Paid $520. <br>Works great, running stock android 10, One UI 2.0.
Hey, MKBHD. Are you noticing any Samsung Note 9 having screen issues/over heating after March or April 2020 software update?
Still using in 2020
How do you not get flagged for playing music on your channel?
I know this phone is getting old now but goddamn I cant wait to get this phone
OMG 2020 and i still cant have one, and i like this more than note10 or the S20
Good review thank for not behaving like stereotypical buffoon.
An easy trick for the bixby button - most people will put a phone in a case.    Cut the bixby button out of the case with a razor knife.     Works great.
Just got this phone, for 350 bucks 😊<br>No notch =❤️
Just checked out your vid cool setting here looking at the shipping box with my new note 9 😀. Getting ready to cut open the shipping box an get started. Peace
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=504">8:24</a><br>What is the name of the wallpaper please?
Got mine for $350 from Sprint and I love it!!!!
still have it now and because of it I am not interested in the new phones
Waste of money....after 14months of use screen atonce turned Green Tinted....samsung has suggested to replace the display
One thing I don&#39;t miss from my S7 Edge is the rolling screen. Makes the screen look bigger but w/o a case, I found my med sized thumbs always touching the screen and causing the phone to do something I didn&#39;t want it too. In a case, it was fine as the case provided a little &quot;buffer&quot;. But the battery got worse and I wanted a tank. Ended up replacing it with a UleFone Armor 3. I&#39;ll just say, it was hard to get past not having to plug it in once or twice a day to charge. I use my S7 now to control my drone. Woot was selling these, as of this typing for for 329.00 (128 gb version). Good price but from my experience with the Samsung (1st year was great, then it started getting laggy), I doubt I&#39;ll ever go back to Samsung for a phone. I&#39;ve gotten used to getting 3 to 4 days out of my battery.
I&#39;m gonna be honest I have the note 9 buts actually shit don&#39;t buy it, I don&#39;t think any samsung is worth to buy. Please anyone convince me that I&#39;m wrong. Anything got to do with performance is so bull. When samsung glitch traditional users know that it freezes for.. forever!!! With Apple u can kinda trust the phone maybe spam the home button but with samsung it&#39;s sooooo dodgy. 2nd day of realistic using: while on Instagram accidently pressed the thing next to the home button and then I&#39;m forced to download samsung pay or the phone freezes on the phone call app (I&#39;m dead serious) watching YouTube it&#39;s dark and colours are horrible compared to iPhone which I&#39;m used to. Marques th exaggerates a lot of stuff I don&#39;t think u actually used the phone normally. Loudness is nowhere near my 3 year old iPad <br>Any other questions or debate reply to my comment I can&#39;t be the ONLY ONE EXPERIENCING THIS!
Very nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=383">6:23</a>
Im getting this
Idk about that display coz idk did u see what Xz3 have from last year. I would do a research before say what u said coz with this act u are saying &quot;fuck Sony phones they are shit&quot; which i dont agree with coz Sony need better marketing and old boxy design with current specs n good camera which is easy possibile for em.
$350 preowned thru Sprint....<br>A proper flagship phone for the low low.
The NOTE 9 is the WORLDS BEST SMARTPHONE!!!!!
6 pillars you forgot speakers!
I want to buy the same case but don&#39;t know where to find it :(
Thank you for your honest review  on this phone. Keep up the great work. God bless.
I own a Galaxy S10 and I see why my father wants to keep his Note9.
Who&#39;s watch before they purchase?
Who wants the note 9?
Who like the note 9?
I have the note 9 and the note 10 plus on 2 active lines and I like the 9 better because of the fingerprint sensor on the back so I can buy a protector that covers the whole screen without a whole in it like I have to get for the 10plus, the headphone Jack so when both my earbuds that I keep in my pocket batteries die I can use wired earbuds and the hole punch on the 10plus dosen&#39;t really bother me but I appreciate my 9 without it.
$370 seller refurb eBay
Nice Video,Love Note 9😍😍😍
Know im too late but my mom gifted me note9 as same as that coz I finally graduated but the sad part here is that we&#39;ve studied for 4years to Junior High just to experience cancellation of completion awww.
Is it still worth in 2020?
Note 9 still rocks. The last samurai of Notchless phones
Do you think this is still worth in 2020?
What is it&#39;s RAM
I&#39;ve had my note 9 for two years and it has started telling me my storahe is close to full, so i deleted every single video which was what was taking most storage up and it is still saying that i have literally 1% of storage left. is it just time for a new one, because i have no doubt this is a load of shit
NOTE 9❤❤❤❤❤
Still rocking my note 9 in 2020 :D
Back when 4000mAh was called a monster battery.
Watching this on my Note10+!
It&#39;s $350 now
i UPGRADED TO NOTE 10 PLUS LAST YEAR POST USING NOTE 9(512/8 GB VARIENT) FOR ABOUT AN YEAR OR SO, BUT I STILL MISS THE PHYSICAL FINGERPRINT SCANNER AND FINGER GESTURE CONTROLL WHICH I USED ALWAYS TO PULL THE QUICK SETTING &amp; NOTIFICATION PANNEL. THE ONLY ISSUE WAS COMPARATIVELY SLOW CHARGING . A FLAGSHIP THAT SUPPORT 15 WATTS OF POWER INPUT ONLY. IT USED TO TAKE 1.5 TO 1HR 45 MINUTES TO FULLY CHARGED FROM 5-10%
Galaxy S20 is here!<br>So Note 10 gets cheaper<br>So I can afford the Note 9 👌
Note phones are not just phones they are a living art 🌇
I pay would 3 thousand dollars not one thousand dollars on this kind of phone
how do u know a note 9 for sale on amazon is original samsung device before you buy?
I watch this video every time I get an itch to upgrade. My Note 9 is still a beast.
I low-key think Samsung made a mistake making this phone.  It has practically EVERYTHING and  makes it harder to rationalize upgrading to their &quot;latest and greatest&quot;.
Ok youtube we know your broken
My galaxy note 9 battery drain so fast,why?
Watching this as I wait on my note 9 to get here from Amazon  so excited!
the battery life sucks in this one, i have factory reset it twice, have two apps only facebook and facebook business manager. this grabage drains even when the phone is not on use. drains twice as fast 10 to 15% every 30 minutes , i get less than 3 hours of batter fcuking life at minimal uses. just buy an MI or xaoimi much better performance half the price

Is it ok to still use note 9 this 2020?
❤ AWESOME WORK! ❤ SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL FOR UPCOMING PAKISTAN BIKE TOURING VIDEOS.
Got a Note 8 really want the 9
A year later and you can find it for 1700pln or around 420$. I&#39;m getting it for sure.
2020, Feb. I got for $280.
I have this phone and I totally agree with him on everything. It&#39;s the best phone I&#39;ve ever had and still have. Worth every penny.
dat gay song intro
I finally got the one ui 2 update today from t-mobile. 2-25-20 . It only took about  20 years to get it but it&#39;s finally here. 😄 The Note 9 still the king regardless of it&#39;s predecessor the Note 10 plus . What&#39;s even better I got it for 400 bucks the 512gb variant.😃👌
What is the refresh rate of the display?
“Edge display. Samsung still does that” 🤣 yep.. not any more 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
u just git my sub ... gr8 job ... super-professional ... thanx a million for being here ...<br><br>tranquility ✌<br>wl
Bought the 512 GB version for $600 on sale. Happy. Before I had the Note 8 (more expensive for just 64 GB storage lmao). But I miss those beautiful infinity themes from the Note 8 so much! Support said I can&#39;t get them anymore, they are phone exclusive. Note 9 infinity themes suck big time.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=187">3:07</a> &quot;...it has a headphone jack.&quot;
What does this phone do that my galaxy go phone doesn&#39;t do besides the storage?  Is there a built in draw pad artists can use?  Is that why the pen is there?  Can you actually use the camera for actual professional photography?  Is the mic on it as good as a yeti?
.Dear Marques, what is the phone screen background? I have a note 9 and have been searching for it for ages.. It is so colorful and vibrant, please tell me how I can find it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=384">6:24</a> looks like the airport map in MW2
fuckin crap 9 with a stupid fingerprint sensor on the back with big chin big forehead a Blu Bold N1 has a on screen fingerprint scanner with no chins and a motorized selfie camera and at 199$ beats the crap out of this overpriced crap
Okay Marques I see u with the razer blade stealth in the background.
NOTE 9 ....on 2020....just got it...HAPPY with it !!!
Bad battery life?<br>Samsung: its 4,000 mah
What about the fact that the S Pen falls out of the phone easily and breaks? Most of the reviews on Samsung&#39;s Web Page complain that the Pen falls out of the phone a lot and breaks.
Hey nice video man, thanks for the information, u did a good job explaining how the phone operates and work!!
And now it cost 300-400$
Greetings from Australia.<br>A great video. After all this time the note 9 is still a valid phone in 2020. I was considering buying a new note 10 plus but from evidence supplied via this medium this phone still rocks and the audio is superior.<br>That is why I bought an A1 grade used model for as little as <br>Aus $500. This phone has still got it.
... and they did... Bixby button can be remapped from August last year...
Watching this in my refurbished Note 9😀
Getting it tomorrow🤩😂❤
What wallpaper were you using on the note9
The note 9 is incredible (posted from a note 9)
My 2020 must-have gadget
Love your channel so much  <br><br>I now this is a little late
Many of my Friends told me to wait for the note 10+. But i figured  nah. I&#39;ll just go  with the note 9. Totally  worth it.
What&#39;s the wallpaper the rainbow one that he uses? Whats it called?
Love my 512gb/8gb ram unlocked note9, loved it so much I bought my son the 128gb version, he was blown away.. I ran the note 4 rooted tmobile version on custom roms until the note9 came out, note 9 still had EVERYTHING, removable battery,  and I added wireless charging to it.. but this note9 was a huge step up and I believe it&#39;s the best all around phone with everything (phone Jack that I&#39;ve used maybe 3 times in 8 years) my son uses the headphones alot on his though..<br>My battery is still pretty good and can just barely get me through a full day of watching videos.  But I&#39;ve got a wireless charger in my truck so it usually over 60% all the time.. processor is great and haven&#39;t really had any lag except using the DraftKings app but I&#39;m positive it&#39;s an app issue because it just recently started lagging on that app.. I&#39;ve also  got a 128gb scarf in it with all of my music, pictures and videos.. its definitely still a top contender in 2020, especially since u can buy a mint unlocked note9 for around $350/400 and use it on any carrier by just flashing your carriers firmware.. <br>This note 9 (8gb ram version can easily run any game out right now, and u gotta remember the note 9 was released exclusively with FORTNITE which I haven&#39;t played yet, maybe I&#39;ll try that tonight
I have a problem,my note 9 easily heating up for no reason and the baterry drain faster than it should,why?
I don&#39;t know whether I should get the note 9 or mate 20 Pro ahh
Maybe note 9 doul sim no auto update???
Can u tell me bro note 9 double sim best or single sim best??
Watching this in 2020 on Note 3.
You look like my baby brother. So cute.
Also if u triple click the home button u turn on one hand mode so the screen becomes significantly smaller. It makes it way easier to move around or text with one hand.
I got a Note 9 for Christmas last year and this year I got an iPhone X....idk which phone I should use now
I might get this in 2020 if I can&#39;t afford the 10 after my birthday
THE ONLY MINUS - NO SOFTWARE UPDATE.
Bought a note 9 128gb in pristine condition on Ebay for 345.
buying the note 9 in 2020 is a smart ? Or should i get something else ?
samsung laptop ekta koto
Please make a vedio about video stuttering issue in s9 and note9.<br>It&#39;s very annoying....
i can finally buy this
I&#39;m getting the phone from a s9 plus
I&#39;m buying this phone in Jan 2020 😂
Can you please ask Samsung to give me one of those? It&#39;s still my favorite phone but unfortunately i can&#39;t afford one. I could do with a used one, Samsung Galaxy Notes are my favorite. From 🇿🇦
End of 2019 and THIS PHONE IS STILL FIIGGING EXPENSIVE even if it is the best imo (coughs- headphone jack)
After 6 years with my awesome Note 3, I&#39;m upgrading to a Note 9. Note 3 is still great, but, it&#39;s time. The one thing I hate about the Note 3 is the sound, so that&#39;s going to be great. I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to pay so much extra for the 10+. Anyways, great review, thanks 👍
Bixby being a complete derp.
Note 9 is the best phone of this decade. Period
Ordering mine tomorrow first thing in the morming 🤑 I&#39;m not goin to sleep tonight
I finally got one. Turns out Samsung never made a phone with a headphone jack after this one. Huge bummer but the Note10 is a step down. I love it.
no removable battery so I&#39;m at the beach with a power bank plugged into it in my pocket and is splashed by a wave and burnt something out in the plug socket and now wont connect to pc or DEX. I am sick of this non removable battery crap.
i wonder what this phone costs now because I am looking to either get the s9, s9 plus, or galaxy note 9
When you played black and yellow... I liked this video and subscribed to you.
Where&#39;d you get that wallpaper from?
This thing is still 900 bucks. Shiet
Love this phone have the dual sim version.
Waiting for Note11 to afford Note9 😂😂😂
MKBHD: If I were to purchase today, should I buy the Note 9 or the Oneplus 7T?
Nice Video
Ey a cuanto melovendes 🌱
It&#39;s a crazy good phone
How do you guys feel about refurbished phones?
Introducing the &quot;apple iphone we&#39;ll make you pay for everything separately only for 30 easy payments of 1000 dollars!&quot;
For the first time i love samsung phone. Only for this design and S10 plus. Not note 10 design. Even after 1 year i still want this phone so bad.
Is it worth to buy note 9 in November 2019 for 500 usd
Wonderful

Where can I get a note 9 unlocked cheap
Qled smartphones in 2020
Its $500 today
Which one should we buy iphone xr or note 9
A year on this phone is being sold by a local telco on a plan for basically next to nothing. This is trend I have fallen into after many years wanting the latest and greatest. While its frustrating being a little behind its much easier on the wallet. The question I have though ... is it still a great phone today and will it last me another 2 years?
What laptop is in your background plzz tell...
I love this phone
This is my weapon to kill Isheeps.
I am watching this video in 2019 and I found one for £73
All of you watching this video with Note and Galaxy. Me battle with my Note 3 in 2019

Good video bro
I&#39;m thinking about buying this phone now what do you think guys please tell me.
ഞാനും എടുത്തു ഒരു നോട്ട് 9
One thing you should add to the five pillars to make a six pillar are great speakers
Planning on getting the note 9 soon for like £450 (if the guy still has it ) or £510 from a different second hand store the note 10 and S10+ Is good but I don&#39;t have the money for that and the note 9 is still and will continue to be an amazing phone
@Marques Brownlee Please give me the name of home screen wallpaper, I searched a lot and didn&#39;t find it :(
Better then iphone
best friend just got me a note 9 for bday fucking amazing phone
what kind of phone does marques like the most Samsung or apple?
Best phone to buy in 2019 for half the price
We love your videos!!!!

Hi guys I&#39;m randhaya Dissanayaka and your video is amazing and you SUBSCRIBE me at YouTube search me by typing randhaya Dissanayaka
Still enjoying my Note 9. Little upgrade on Note 10
Great review - I enjoyed it and it was super well done. Thank you, Marques.
After 1 year its $584 (41.5k INR) makes it a great deal.
I love the note but I don&#39;t use the s pen.  So I&#39;m happy for the S+ series
&#39;Upgrading&#39; to Note 9 tomorrow. 50% off! 😊👍🏻 (trading in my cracked s9+)
Im here in 2019<br>And everybody talked about if apple make a phone whith stylus pen it cost thousnds of bucks<br>Iphone 11 realised and it supports apple pencil and you shold buy it seperatley<br>Congradulation to apple fans😄<br>And another thing is it stick up to the body by magnet
Samsung note series is the best in the world.. stylus called real innovation...
Such a bad phone.... In ten months my note 9 display has gone.... Bull shit.. even though it is in warranty period the company rejected warranty... Now I&#39;m supposed to pay rs14000 for it..... Will never go for Samsung...🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
How many of you are still watching this review in 2019 on your note 9
Teast
I bought note 9 with 500$
Great review bro cheers drom the Caribbean 😎☺
Who has owned the note 1, 2, 4 and 9
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=224">3:44</a> lol
My Note 8 had lots of issues.  The Note 10 has just been released, but for me isn&#39;t worth the $$.  The Note 9 rocks - way better than the 8.  Speakers, being able to coordinate the pen with bluetooth, taking pix with it - selling points for me there alone.  Those who are wanting 5 cameras on a phone and other bells and whistles might want the 10 - but the 9 is awesome at a much better price point.
Thanks for the info, everything i needed to know,  well done.
i do have note 9... its kinda good phone.. before note 9 i used iphones... i changed because of note 9 stylus..
Excellent video!<br>WELL articulated!<br>I purchased a &quot;renewed&quot; used &quot;perfect out of the box&quot;<br>Note 9 (for $555) a few months ago because of budget constraints, underdeveloped fluency skills that need to be upgraded to exploit the functionality of this phone, had a headphone jack, s-pen and the large screen.<br>Really like the phone.<br>We&#39;ll see what future iterations bring as to if/when to &quot;move up&quot;.<br>Thanks
Watching this on my note 9, how meta🤣
I love it...the bigger the better
Can’t decide if I want the note 9 or oneplus 7 pro
I have a note 9 and I dropped it and I cracked it I dropped it again now I have a black line covering about 15% of my phone
I prefer s9+
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=146">2:26</a> Are those KitKat Icons?
Thanks for the video. I like this phone and i want it 🙈❤
500 gigs? Hell yeah.
I had a note 5 and loved it. Switched to iPhone just because why not. I cant wait to switch back to samsung. I miss my note. And iPhone x sucks. No customization and battery suuucckks. Getting the note 9 or 10 on my next upgrade
The coffee beans at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=128">2:08</a> tho
Bixby can be disables and remapped using button mapper, if you have a windows pc its dead easy
I’m from the future the Note 10 will have no headphone jack
What about screen burning issues
Haha revisit again😄😆I also skipping 10 plus because 4300 mah is not a large jump and also no phone jacks😫😫
Note 9 very good mobile <br>I bought it 10 months ago and i will skip the note 10 😁 because I don&#39;t see big difference between them 🤨
Bought mine $478 I just had to wait for  11 months
you have to be fair and compare the Samsung devices that come with Exynos with other phones because all smartphones of the shitty Samsung ibn the middle east do not come with the snapdragon processor also you have to mention the problems with this phone <br>the screen burns and the notifications from all apps arrive very late
Note 9 vs oneplus 7 pro please
Still watching this in 2019 Aug... I also did a long term on this beast 😎
Always love your unbiased reviews. You just &quot;get it&quot; when it comes to pointing out the things us average phone users would actually find useful and necessary in a phone. Keep up the good work.
Samsung a year ago: MORE FEATURES!<br>Samsung today: uhhh.... wanna a rainbow phone? no jack included and it has a punchhole
sir, which phone do you prefer is good iphone xs or samsung note 9? cause i&#39;m gonna buy a new one
Good video thank you 😊
I&#39;m glad I was able to get mine working on Straight Talk. I love this phone.
2.4K iSheeps disliked the video.
who bought note 9 recently ?? i bought today, for 62k , 8+ 512gb
who will buy 1000$ android phone
Watching this on my Note 10.<br><br><br><br><br>Come one someone always says this
Betrayed by what Samsung has done to Note 10, but Note 9 still rocks.
Note 9 or s10e?
Sooo I came here after the note 10 impressions lol hiiii!
NOTE 10 WILL BE BIG FOLOP.  PRICE OF NOTE 9 IS NOT GOING TO DROP. SO HURRU AND BUY NOTE 9
IN FRONT OF NOTE 9   NOTE 10 IS NOWHERE
<b>Note 10 gets released</b><br>YouTube: Let&#39;s flood his YouTube with Note 9 impressions and reviews <br>Me: Maybe YouTube knows I can only afford the Note 9 now.
Hey everyone. I am on a note 3 its finally time for me to upgrade. For you note 9 owners how solid has the reliability been? I can get a note 9 new for around $400 vs the 1k price of the 10 plus.

Samsung: Note 10 releases<br><br>YouTube: Let&#39;s pump out Note 9 content
I have the note 9 and love that wallpaper. Where can I get it?
The last best note. note 10 is a big disappointment.
Just got the note 9 yesterday
here after note 10 launch
Now that note 10 is released i can buy note 9🌝🌝
note 10 announced. time to buy note 9
Note 9.. Oneplus 7 Pro.. S10+.... Which is best  to buy??? Thanks
You can remap the bixby button, i have it set to Google 😂
Who is here from the note 10/10+ impressions vid ?<br><br>Edit: yo why tf this blew up like this lmao
Can you get Google now launcher?
The pictures quality taken from my note 9 is becoming worse and worse with every software update, the picture blurry most of the time, unable to focus,, the sharpness reduce drastically even in a bright area, im very disappoint with the pictures quality over the time, is Samsung downgrading the camera quality with every update? Anyone have the same problem as me???
I was watching a lot of videos about note 9 and i have it now and i gotta say that its awsome
It&#39;s almost time for the note 10 review.  Can&#39;t wait
Came from a Note 9, then swapped it with a Mate 20 Pro...<br><br>Now Im back with a Note 9...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=224">3:44</a> song name plz
PLEASE review Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro
The camera though, can anyone help adjust the beautify mode? Seems like its a permanent thing
&quot;A thousand bucks is a lot to spend on a phone&quot; Meanwhile in Malaysia, we spend minimum 1k for a phone :(
Who’s watching this in 2019?
Everyone: omg cant wait for note 10 to arrive<br>Me: hehehe in a couple of weeks i could probably get the note 9 for half its original price boye hehe he
Watching this on my new note 9, alhamdulillah.
You know as an iPhone user, I find the Note phones to be the only other phone I’d buy (which is why I’m buying the XI (11) Max and the Note 10 to have 2 great phones!
Who&#39;s watching on an s10 plus?  Meeeee
My girlfriend uses two hands too. She always say my note is too big for her.
Would you say the note 9 is better than s10 plus , I&#39;m thinking of swapping that&#39;s all .
I was gonna hold out upgrading my s8+ until note 10 but after hearing no headphone Jack and no expandable storage I&#39;m gonna pick up a note 9 and save alot of money
note 8 design over note 9 hit like
Breaking News: No more fornite skin for this phone R.I.P <br>1 like= hope this skin comes back!
Finally, an unbias REAL review ! Unlike Unbox Theory etc which was 75% of the video praising it and <b>25% of the rest of the video nitpicking 1 or 2 things with sour thumbnails lol</b> . Watching now from my Note 8 pi UI which I still like.
نعم 👍👍👍yes
I’m not a tech savvy guy, but how long would Android keep sending updates out for this phone? <br><br>I coming from a iPhone 5S that was supported for 4-5 years.
After some time it will slow and click random things by itself
can you make a size comparizon with xa2 ultra? is it the same?
Why the coffee beans @ the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=552">9:12</a> mark? 🙄
<b>FUCK THE NOTE 10.U DON&#39;T LISTEN.WE DON&#39;T BUY.</b>
it&#39;s sooo much better than my iPhone 8 plus.
As usual the best review :D
Worth it now in 2019? I don&#39;t want the note 10 without the headphone jack
watching this video on my Galaxy Note 4... on 14th july 2019..
Now with One UI ou can map the bixby button bro. Good update.
This phone does it all and more! well worth it!
I remapped the Bixby button with an app called Bx actions worked decently. I guess it can do more if you us a pc to load it. I didn&#39;t try that.
might pick it up in a couple of years when i can afford it
Thank you so much for the info, very useful...and I love me Note 9 !!!
this is how to review a television.
Watching on my Note 4 and not getting the 10 or 15 or Note Millennium 500 by year 2023. Unless the Note transforms into a flying hoover board with holograms and visual GPS, talk to my hand 🖐
It&#39;s not worth it.
Hate my s9 so just ordered the note 9 praying its better
still watching with note9....I wish my note9 can be used till 5years
Some people say that they don&#39;t want wireless charging they want a headphone jack but with note 9 youcan literally have<br> Both. Definitely gonna buy this tomorrow
Thank you Marques. I bought it more than 2 months ago. And I m watching this video through MY Note 9.❤❤
hey thanks for your attention but i dont need to access i have vpn i know how to access i want to know how to install because it is not installed so do you have some ideas ?))) how to do it
Marques to Bixby: show me a bixby speaker review.<br>Bixby: who do you want to call?
Thinking of getting this phone in 2019 is it still worth it? <br>I know the note 10 is out this year but i am thinking the price will reduce a lot on this handset.
Need to add a wireless Mic with a pointer Laser/FlashLight on the Pen! Very useful for Professional Videography for filming a wedding ETC, just put the pen on shirt pocket. Hopefully the NoteX uses the wireless Mic on the pen.
To much for  JUST A PHONE YES.....BUT NOT FOR A POCKET COMPUTER...IS WHAT YOU ARE BUYING...😌⁉️
The sides suck. My ugly s9 plus got damaged in auto accident, so ordered the note 9. Time to get black duct tape to create left and right bezels.
you are so handsome and smart :)
Samsung&#39;s King in Displays I Still use the S6 and it&#39;s screen still stands upto the likes of Oneplus Except the 7Pro and Xr And Else
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=224">3:44</a>
I&#39;m broke but still love my note4
Wallpaper?
waiting for note 10+
At 3.44 see what i did there
i wish i can buy one😞😞😞😞
Would you chose iPhone X’s or note 9 as your everyday use?
Imagine the 1 terabyte hard drive in a console, Samsung needs to make a console with this technology
Ofcourse i reverse it and time it just perfect to see the 5 pillars just to find out he was show it 2 seconds later
So happy with samsung note 9🤣
Hit like who thinks note 8 looks  classy as compared to note 9
Still confused S9+ or note9
I still have the Note 8, is it worth the upgrade or just is better to wait the N10?
I need to stop watching these reviews AFTER I buy the phone
will you choose this over iphone xs??
Camera issue facing.vibrating phone and sounds coming when zoom camera.. manufacturing defect...<br>So disappointed after spending costly phone
Camera zooming problem.<br>Shaking camera.sounds coming..vibrating etc.....<br>I bought note 9... really disappointed such a costly...
I got s10 plus but not sure about it design I prefer chunkier design of note 9 . Previously had note 8
s10 plus look better
Apple users: 1000 dollars for a phone no<br><br>Android users : then why did you buy the iPhone X that is 1000 dollars <br><br>Apple users : oh
Do you think you could answer me an opinion question regarding the note 9 since apparently no other reviewer wants to take the time to answer the question for me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=222">3:42</a> I died 😂😂😂
I am watching on my note 9
Who&#39;s still a note 2 owner here? 🙋‍♂️
Watching a video about the note 9 on my note 9.
You sir are a fantastic spokesman. You do a great job explaining information. I’m very impressed.
Facing camera problem in INDIAN version. ( hardware issue please do review on that)
Man I’ve always loved Samsung note but all my media is organized in iTunes even if they’re shutting it down. So I’ve turned to apple. I hope one day Samsung could somehow integrate their phones with iTunes or the now music app.
Ha ha you and your big hands :) ;)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=599">9:59</a> what widget is that?
I will always buy note phones whenever where ever.
Need one 😣 giveaway one 🖤 badly need one plzz can give me one 😣😔
Watching on my note 9😂
who cares if you have problems using it or not
2k people gave this thumbs down? Idiots.
Black man🤣🤣🤣🤣
I have a Samsung Galaxy note 9 and is the best Android phone at the moment that i have.
I like your wallpaper. Lol.
Watching on my note 9
D phones GREAT!
BRO! <br>where do you get your clothes from ? <br>They are COOL,<br>You should also do some videos related to clothing.
He said infinity first then said bleeding edge <br><br>Get it
Watching this video on this phone makes me think of that question...&quot;why would someone buy a Masseratti to simply drive to the corner store&quot;. Phones like this are only for die hard phone users rather than people who use their phones for more normal usage. Thanks, but I will stay with an Asus phone at one third the price and not miss a thing....<br>But hey, if you have the money and want to waste it like this, go for it.....
Mk is a default
Recently got this phone and love it!!😍👌
Battery is insane on this phone, I can go all day without charging and still wake up with some battery left. This phone is the best phone I&#39;ve ever had. By a long shot. And I&#39;ve had my share of iPhones as well. iPhone is just generic. Ppl buy them to copy one another. It&#39;s just a trendy brand is all it is. And apple gets some of their &quot;new&quot; features from Samsung that Samsung was doing for years lol. Apple users talk about the new amazing facial recognition, my old metro pcs phone I had 8 years ago had facial recognition 😂 step up your game apple
Can Someone Whose Using Note 9 Already can tell me if this phone has Same issue as note 8? Appearing Black Dot
waiting for this to drop in price when Note 10 comes out lol
Im only watching tht razer laptop gaming instead of note9
Idk why everyone is jealous of Apple
Useless product display get crack
Upgraded to NOTE 9 from note 2😍😍
For the black and yellow joke, i smiled, i liked
I have the Note 8, after being with apple for 6 years. Needless to say I&#39;ll never not have a Note 8. best phone period.
Soon I’m upgrading from my iPhone 5s to the note 9, the difference will be unbelievable
I&#39;m watching this because my note 9 is  getting old on me
I am on my second go round with the note 9 only to have sold my first one to buy the mate 20 pro. It was only then being that the note 9 was my first time ever using a note series phone that it was and even still is today end of the first quarter 2019 by far the best smartphone phone I&#39;ve ever use, professionally written about or reviewed and it will continue to be until the note 10 is released. I even just picked up the S10 but once you experience the S pen every and any other flagship feels incomplete compared to the note 9 having acquired that taste of the s pen
coffee beans on desk
Few weeks ago I&#39;m testing with my bro Iphone x max. Because my note 4 is showing signs of aging.. well what can i say? 5 years without being to careful with it,yet it survived. So come back to iphone.. after using it for few days. I am not kidding, it is so smooth and fast. Of course it based on my experience with note 4. But besides the smooth and garage band( the only reason i agree to test with iphone), i dont see much different. Then I gv it bck to my bro and he sold it. Me being then is rather stuck with 5yrs old phone, and i wont want that iphone. Then it comes to a week ago, my note 4 is dead and now i am here with my note 9. Once a note,u can never away frm it. I do understand why apple fan will always stick to apple, it is because they are used to it. So why not let them be? They buying their apple product doesnt burning your money right? It is their money. And me, i find note suits my use, so i&#39;ll always with note. Despite i do like the smoothness apple runs and garage band, but those doesnt do much. I need much frm what apple can offer.
Hella good phone. I hope they keep the curved screen and no notch
This is my dream smartphone
No IR blaster for remote control use. I was a little bummed about that loss when I upgraded from the Note 3 to the Note 9.
Am currently on galaxy s7.... Am confused between mate 20 pro and note 9... Which one will be better.? Please help me out
Exynos varient eh eh 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎

When it comes to shape, many reviewers used to criticize XPERIA for its rectangular and sharper corners, but look at this Galaxy Note 9, it is actually looks like XPERIA phone!
500gb-porn
Is the 9 the price? $9.
Has the Note 9 a ultra wide angle lens?
Huge hands u got there. It would useful in basketball.
Meh, looks just like my note 8.  I&#39;ll be waiting for the note 10.  My note 8 is no slouch in 2019.
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 got me into the Note series. Tried iPhone and the only complaint i have is the battery life, which my brother told me was better when i was contemplating buying one (obviously he lied lol). Side note: i like the size of the phone because the screen size is bigger.
Cant wait to see the note 10
the only difference between this and the samsung 9 plus is the battery and s pen, i dont like the spen, but the battery is welcome, however its not worth paying 200+ for just a bigger battery when the s9+ can charge up really fast.
I think the iso-performance on the Note 9 is a massive improvement.<br>So indeed the whole family has great camera&#39;s Note 8, S8, S9 etc. - but this one on the Note 9 is da bomb!
Bro its good for gaming?
Please do a Note 9 review w/ One UI
mark ass brownie
Note 9 or S10+ ?<br><br>Which one should I buy?

Your in NY? Cool. Hello neighbor.
Love my note 9
and it will start lagging after 6 months of use
Hey my note9 (the one I&#39;m using right now) is the same color as the one showcased in the video
Note9- my dream phone.
Can someone please suggest a good tempered glass screen protector for this phone? In the past I&#39;ve smashed my s7 edge and s8 screens and i just cannot let it happen with the note 9.
My galaxy A9 has the same blue color as this phone......not that it matters,I just thought that you need to know
Just purchased to upgrade my Samsung Galaxy Note 4! Thank you very much for your review MKBHD!
1000$ wtf i get it fir like 1300$
Can anyone tell me where can i get those hoodie
Just watching this mid April I can now buy a note 9 for 445 pounds now we are talking  jumping from iPhone to ghis
Hey... Note 9 has a camera issue. When you zoom in the camera vibrates and the picture becomes fuzzy.  Lots of people have faced this globally, including me... can you do a video about it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=224">3:44</a> <br>YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
watching on note9
Im an apple user and im stuck in it  please help me to stop using iphone.  Apple is really made me as a prisoner. Because of its user friendly software And eco system and camera and the speakers plz help guys
I want to buy a Note 9, but is locked, any recommendation?
Hi Marques, do you have a Note that you&#39;d like to get rid of? If so, I&#39;ll gladly pay shipping. Still using a Windows Phone (Nokia 1520) and I  just cant justify the prices on these new phones! 😬
yesterday finally i change Note 9 from 7edge.🤣
Samsung best in the world <br>Because in their phones available 3.5mm headphone jack triple card slot(2sim+memory card)<br>Enough for me
Watching this on my Note 9
I like that phone but Note 9 is too big for pockets
will the note 9 have the one hand mode?
Where do I get that wallpaper??
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Giveaway! :D
Installing apps on a Samsung phone takes forever.. So slow and shit.. I used my cousins Note 9 and it was awesome. Samsung ONLY care about looks.. MY Xperia XZ2 is miles quicker haha.
It could have been great but the cheaply made Bluetooth Stylus sucks and constantly breaks but they pretend not to know and you&#39;ll be forced keep buying new one or they&#39;ll force you to send the defective one the play games for over a month till your frustrated and give in. I&#39;m on my 3rd and only owned the device a few months. Never again with this company
Does vr work out of the box on the note 9
You are the best at reviewing gadgets!<br>Have been following you for about a year now🖒
I upgraded to the Note 9 from an S7 edge last year &amp; before that, I had no need for the S pen but now I&#39;ve become incredibly dependent on it... I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be able to go back to the S series
Apple is losing.. except that they hire me to design their phones.. 😆
I luv your videos. Can&#39;t wait til note 10 video
Bixby can be remapped with third party apps
you&#39;re good at frisbee
I just got the note 9 3 days ago, coming from having an iPhone. I got so tired of Apple and all of those cords.<br> This phone is huge and some of the features are similar. I just don&#39;t like the android emojis, but other than that it&#39;s pretty cool so far.
I wanna switch from Xperia XZ1 Compact to Note 9. Thank you for your review :)
And now it is available for €555
best phone reviews!
Watching on Note 9 😂
What game did u tested, game name pls ???
Which is better note9 or iphone8plus ?<br>I really wanna to know your opinion
Watching this on my note 9 lol so far so good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=68">1:08</a>
When In fullscreen gestures mode, swiping from the home button to the recent button would bring a pixel like navigation bar in the recents menu.
Good ad.
Well time to buy me a note 8.
Came over to the note 9 after being a life long apple user. What I will say is the note 9 is everything the iPhone wishes it could be. Apple was once Inovating and now it&#39;s just a company that follows sammy. If you switch over to the note 9 from apple like I did you wont regret it
If apple released an S pen, they would sell the phone separately
Still The BEST phone in 2019,because now i can buy brand new and fabric sealed Note 9 for 500€<br>And S10+ is one BIG disappointment for me.<br>Nothing really innovative for 1200€<br>No graphene battery <br>Iris scanner <br>No better refreshing rate than 60Hz <br>No IR blaster<br>There is a notch <br>No second real speaker <br>The stabilization and the wide lens camera are awesome, but to pay 1200€ just for a wide lens camera and better stabilization is not working for me.<br>From the other hand for the price of just one S10+ i can buy two Note9 with:<br>S-pen<br>The same stereo speakers <br>The same quality of the camera <br>No notch<br>The same display <br>Iris scanner <br>But this is just my personal opinion.<br>P.S.iphone ?....What is this iphone ?<br>Ooo,i remember now.<br>Iphone was that old piece of technology from those greedy mother fuckers from apple.<br>🤣<br>Well,FUCK YOU apple 🖕
So last year it&#39;s the total package, this year it&#39;s chopped liver? This phone is still the King of smartphones
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=312">5:12</a> is that a built in screen recorder?

Whats the title of the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=1">0:01</a>
i think i&#39;m getting this phone tomorrow  i&#39;m so hyped
Four months in, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Galaxy Note 9! Best phone ever. And thanks to a sale at Best Buy, I got it for around the same cost as my previous phone, the Galaxy S7. Actually, my monthly phone bill decreased by $3 when I upgraded to the Note 9! I&#39;m addicted to large screen display so the S7 never did cut it for me. LOVE MY GALAXY NOTE 9 ♥
I don&#39;t know why the body matters when we&#39;ll just have to put a case on it anyway...
A1 content, keep up the good work!
I have LG G6+. Should I upgrade to Note9? Need your experience from this device
Note 9 is a PIECE OF SHIT
WHY THE FUCK HE AINT DO THE FUCKIN BUDS !!!!😡
I phone user switching to Galaxy Note 10 once it comes out, apple sucks ass I’m done with shitty apple, i phones suck.
In the market for a new phone, and still not sure about the Note 9, but your presentation is great!  Thanks!
that curve display was anoying as fuck i had this phone but only because that i switch back to note 4.
Is it still good now? I’m wondering if I should pick this phone or iphone x, or some other suggestions? I’m looking for a phone to use it for drawing, is there anything more perfect than this one?
Watching the isheep lose their minds in the comments has me rolling...I will pass on a company that makes changes to a product to suck out another dollar and calls it innovation...or makes sure an update kills the battery on an older phone model to try and force consumers to upgrade and has the gall to say they just wanted to give customers the best possible service when they got called out on it...switched to android 2.5 years ago and have not looked back...now working on getting my wife to switch...she loves my note 8 but soon to be note 9...
The fact that people still call these devices (phones) is literally overwhelming
Bye bye iPhone Xr
Any one interested yo buy my note 9 new phone may contact 7011127901
I <b>NEED</b> IT
Good note 9 is veary veary veary gooooooiooooiooooooooooooood I AM BYE TODAY
Those are just the thicker phones that aren&#39;t the main phone.
tbh lf I were to chose Note over s10 or s10e I&#39;d pick it over than those. It cost as much as s10e now and it probably offers more.
Yaaaa That&#39;s Hot.
I&#39;m watching on my....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>P20 Pro lol.</b>
A thousand bucks is too much way too spend on a phone I would never do that
I’m Getting a Samsung note 9 soon !!!
Damn Marque - I can&#39;t get thru 1 video of yours without a tech boner. Keep up the great work man! &lt;3
I lost my fucking s pen
My type of note one thing missing is the IR blaster
Note 9 or s10

Can you imagine This video was 2 GB When MKBHD upload it
1000$ for a phone is too much-said iPhone X users
@MarquesBrownlee Hi, nice review. I watched a review that you did with one of your colleagues where you stated that you prefer the Mate 20 pro. Do you still feel that way? if applicable how does the Mate 20 compare to the Note 9? and lastly, is this review of the Note 9 your honest review or is it a paid review? Thank you.
Can you make a video explaining why you don’t use the Note on a daily basis? Thanks 🙏
Its mind blowing how I got this phone for $650. It&#39;s still one of the top phones in the world. It even competes and might even win over the s10e cheapther than 750 and wayayayayyyyyyyyyyy better in every way. Except display but hey HDR 10+ is not a big different not worth it. Note 9 is monumental. The best thing you can buy right now by far and I bet it will continue being the best bang for the buck throughout 2019 and maybe even 2020
Maaan I hope samsung makes a flat screen note 10 this year.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=194">3:14</a> &quot;the speakers - they&#39;re in the same place as they were, but they&#39;re now much louder and fuller sounding, and straight up better&quot;. That&#39;s all you say about the speakers.<br>I don&#39;t follow the smartphone market tightly, could you not say <b>where</b> the speakers are located? I&#39;m not seeing any bottom speaker on the back and neither on the front. Come on. the &#39;little&#39; things
I think you made a really great review, great screen captures, constructive pointouts and very to the point. really awesome review, thank you so much.
I&#39;ve had every Samsung flagship phone since the original S1 and after 2 of the Note 7&#39;s I said no more and went to Huawei Mate 10 Pro and couldn&#39;t be happier.  However, this huge screen and the stylus has me wanting to give it a shot.
Sir whats the weight of the phone with box when shipped from online
Watching this on note 8 until FedEx gets here today with my note 9!
Just bought the same exact one today woot woot ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽
no....no skins to hide the nice finish of this $1,000 phone. I put a clear Spigen case on it.
nice, looking forward to note 10 to upgrade from my lovely note 8
damn expensive
After watching some of your videos,  my only question is, which phone do you use personally?
I like both ios and android 👍🏾😇
It&#39;s worth the money I got one
200 USD unlocked. Thanks to friends. Lol. I was not going to buy another Samsung due to the s9 plus uneven screen brightness thing. But hell I&#39;ll take the deal I just got.
I just got the 512GB last week, it&#39;s an incredible piece of kit! One thing not pointed out is ease of use, another is hand comfort, I don&#39;t have great big bear paws, but the note nine is easy to use, the finger naturally rests close to the scanner, all in all Samsung have built my perfect phone, no need to futter about with it anymore!
If I get this phone from Iraq new Will is rill be able to redeem the galaxy skin? Or is it just for some devices
just review how is the call quality or is not use so much for that. does it really big hold it to your ear
Watching on my s9 plus
Note 10 is gonna be balls to the wall.
THE PERFECT SMARTPHONE ON THE PLANET!
Im getting a note 9 2morrow!!!!!!
Never seen one of your video&#39;s but I got my self a Note 9 and yours pop out. Comment none related to the Note I have to give you props for video&#39;s!! <br><br>The way you display the phone on those background of the laptop, notebooks etc. and those coffee beens near the coffee cup my man you nailed it!!! Great clean scenes!!<br><br>You probably won&#39;t even read this comment but just wanted to cheer you up and say what a great job your doing on your video scenes!! <br><br>Best wishes for your channel!!

You forget one thing good software if software sucks the phone wont be good
Galaxy Note 9 | a Beauty Beast
Super biased review.....constantly sounded like samsung fan boy
U can&#39;t actually compare this with apple shit
big up to you Marques, i just want to say that i dont understand this amoled thing me personally after using the LG G7 ips i found that in comparison when i watch movies and videos overall there are scene&#39;s where the black is so deep that i cant see sceneries like on the lg ips. After several Samsung&#39;s burn in i can say that I&#39;m a fan of the lg ips.
I&#39;m watching this on a Note 9 cuz I didn&#39;t know what my phone was offering.
Did you notice 9 get cable internet wired with adapter?
Very impressive phone. Have had no problems. Except a DOA, cuz it stopped reading Sim cards... But this one is great.
did Samsung fix the burned pixels issues  or screen ghost problem ???<br><br><br>i have used the galaxy s2,s3,s4,s6,note2,note3,note4 and they all had the same problem after six months of usage with 100 % screen brightness on<br>that,s why i have turned into an Iphone user<br><br>i wish that this problem is fixed because i miss using Samsung
I’m a android boy you iOS users will never let me join the iOS side
The speakers, the speakers, the speakers!!!

A little confused between the choice of buying Note 9 or One Plus 6. Help please
I whis I wasn&#39;t dead broke so I could get this device
There are a lot of people who change their phone Apple to Samsung, but not much for Samsung to Apple, or otherwise they regret.
Guys I have a question for you. What if you bought two note9s with different colors, and removed the s-pen and switched it out to the other? Would the s pen still work?
If only my S9 Plus had that blue colour would be perfect for me...
I can wait 1 year of the price drop
The bixbie button can be remapped with 3rd party apps
You can set it to triple click the home button and the screen will shrink for one handed using
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=255">4:15</a> what is the name of the app where you can get that widget?
I don&#39;t like the infinity display yet. Had the phone 3 weeks now
I want fortnite and Márques brownlee
Use 2 hands while using the phone robbers are everywhere
I’m finally upgrading to a new phone I had the iPhone 6 since 2015 and I don’t know which phone to get iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, or Samsung Galaxy Note 9? I do also like color options on my phone as well
Marques, nice review indeed.<br>I&#39;ve S8+, do u recommend is it worth to upgrade with Note 9 ????<br>Kindly give your technical opinion plz .......
Hey , didnt u find the notches top n bottom too thick ?!? They should&#39;ve made the top notch much slimmer .. wat r ur thoughts .. planning to get this phone ..

Mark-ass-brown-lee
The fact that you took the time to tell us about the case, throw in Black and Yellow and do the &quot;see what I did there&quot; made me subscribe. Great review!!!!
I have an iPhone and it’s just obvious this is the best phone you can buy
just got This phone and I Love It The camera is awesome
The only reason i don&#39;t have a Samsung is because of how much bloatware they add to andriod.
Hey Marques, where did you get the wallpaper from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=62">1:02</a>?
Even if there is a note version with more storage , can you not swap this one with a bigger memory card ?
thanks for the reviews,even cant afford to buy that,thats soo expensive phone now,watching from Philippines
FORTNITE AND marques brownlee
Fortnite epic account is C_Wayne_A
I have the iPhone 7+ and it’s good, I like it. But I really can’t see myself getting another iPhone. I say when this phone needs to be upgraded I’ll get the note9, finally I can listen to music and charge again😍
Crazy how the note 9 is 749,- euros in the Netherlands and 999,- USD,
if Apple and Samsung made a phone together <br>they would call it &#39;Sample&#39;
Nice
I love my Note 9 🥰
miss this full screen videos we want it back!!!!
I just bought one for 899.99 and I love it
How did you get fortnite on it?
I’ve had iPhones for years now and nothing else. Im sick of it having terrible battery and sh*t screen res etc. I’m officially switching to Samsung. Like if you support me
Damn solid review! Now i want a note 9 😭
I want this 📱
I&#39;ve had a Samsung S series phone since the S3. The S8+ was my favorite phone. Now that I&#39;ve upgraded to the S9 Note, I&#39;m waiting to fall in love with it. Great phone but I lost a few S8+ features.
You can say no notch but look at the top they just decided not to add screen and everyone is praising them for it
Does note 9 has a better speaker than s9+?
I Hate my Note 8 -curved Edges are as dumb as u GET! - Candy BAR screen not wide enough!! NOTE 9 has same stupid design! - Make it easier to crack screen -
Do you have an upcoming review on the one ui in the Note 9? I can&#39;t decide in updating my phone or not.
Question for Samsung users that have used their phones for over a year please. Has anyone had any trouble with the type C charging port wearing out in their Samsung? I only ask because my last two cheaper ZTE phones with type C charging port wears out so the charger wire will not fit properly even after cleaning the port best I can. Sounds funny but I think the note 8 screen is to narrow. My girlfriend has a note 8 and ZTE screen overall is bigger and videos look the same. I have my note 9 coming because I need better quality to last several years and I&#39;m getting wireless charger to help save the charging port. Thanks
Watching on my ZTE MAX DUO with a wider screen. BUT, later today my new Note 9 will be here.
Hah! I&#39;m never going to buy that phone! ( hears that it has a head phone jack) ok never mind...
What’s the wallpaper? Is it a default note 9 one?
better dont let samsung update ,, or that wil be like the others  slow and laggy or defctive forcing you tu buy the next model
I&#39;m watching this video on my note 9
Miss my Note 9 and going back to it
Everyone who has Samsung note 9 can tell how much it goes screen on battery life with 4G and without 4g (LTE)?
I just got the note 9 about 2 weeks ago. Came from a note 8. Battery was ehhh but I upgraded because my screen randomly had a single crack going across the screen and it was annoying me. So I went and got it and the thing I NOTICED THE MOST, was how my battery literally last ALL DAY if not two Days and I love it because there&#39;s times where I get too tired to even plug up my phone. But if I  charge my phone overnight and wake it if course it&#39;s at 100% if I dont charge it depending on how I use it itll last until the next early afternoon.
Samsung is the most innovative smartphone company in the world.
It as some issues while playing Pubg please advise too much of lagging
watching on my note 9 lol
I just  bought this phone today because of u Marques! Thank u
getting one tomorrow 😎
No phone is worth that price, don’t care how rich you are
Anyone who owns a note ever realize when using them the dual speakers the top one stops playing and you notice it when it kicks back in? Or is that just mine
I really take faith in your reviews. Think I&#39;ll be getting myself a Note 9 instead of an iPhone. 😁
Thanks for the review! I’m upgrading to the Note 9 from an iPhone 7 Plus and I’m super excited......😁😁😁😁

What should I get iPhone XS or the galaxy note 9
I just shed a tear of joy.
Is everyone gonna just ignore the map from modern warfare 2 &quot;terminal&quot; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=386">6:26</a>????
Broke my phone this past Friday and grabbed the Note 9 on the humble (money wasn&#39;t an issue but wanted more bang for the buck) and I am very pleased. Big, bright and fast. The long lasting battery and the huge amount of storage space is a major bonus amongst a host of other features. First time owner of a galaxy and strongly recommend it to anyone.
Why did you not include the wallpaper!!!
If you can&#39;t reach the top corner of the phone, use one handed mode.
I have an interesting situation, I just bought at the official Samsung store new Note 9, and when I open the package on the back glass I find a crack.<br><br>I think there will be no problem to change the damaged product on next day, but unfortunately in Latvia, Samsung is treated terribly against customers and now there is nothing else to do, it looks like I will have a refuse to change the phone.<br><br>lesson of this: Open packaging at store, in front of the seller&#39;s eyes and turn inside the phone !!!!!
I like it
Thanks marques for recommending. I&#39;m watching this on Note 9 and I&#39;m loving it on my first day
Hi Guys, I have an S7 edge, I want to get the Note 9 now but do ye think I should hold out for the S10 edge?
My 5 inch Redmi 4X has a 4100 mAh battery 🤔
Poor review compared to others
Man you ruined YouTube rewind
Which you’ll prefer iPhone xs max or samsung s9 plus?
Note 9 fake your phone
Just got it yesterday. Didnt know what i was getting into. Was waiting for the s10+, but I changed my mind and picked this randomly. Now I Love it. Lol
This is the most useless phone ever. It can&#39;t perform basic tasks such as copy/ paste a text. The text wraps around the screen makes it impossible for the pen to select or highlight. The phone chase has a narrow bazle which makes it un easy to hold. Not even with a pouch. It also has a useless didicated Samsung button if you press it you&#39;ll waste 5 minute of your time before you can use the phone again. Besides that it&#39;s a cool nice phone.
Still using the Note 4 bit I&#39;m thinking of getting a new one just because I love new tech things. The Note 4 really already does all I need.
This video is stunning on my Note 9
It feels like something is holding you back
Should I get this or the s9?
Guys I’m switching from apple to the note 9
i always will prefer samsung over to any phone
Guys I need help. I need a new phone. I&#39;m thinking of 3 options. 1) one plus 6t. 2) galaxy note 9. 3) or wait till something latest from 2019?please share some thoughts
Ugh why do I gotta be so broke ass.<br><br>Oh well still liking my s7 edge. Spidered screen doe.<br><br>D :
Ok so you barely covered the 5 points. You just babbled on for 10 mins about the screen. Nothing about the camera in low light. Nothing about the note pen. Seriously, this review is lacking so bad. I&#39;m surprised you have this many views. Dislike from me. This phone is so expensive, people deserve a decent review.
Markass brownlee
And what about the Dex mode ??? You have forgotten to talk about it ...
most my classmates are isheeps and i&#39;d show them this video but i realize that they&#39;re too dumb to even get the point lmao,, they say that apple has the best camera and they clearly don&#39;t when cheaper android phones can get the same quality of picture
I used to have the first gen of Galaxy Note and it might not the same as the Note 9, I find myself using the pen a lot. 128GB of storage is enough for me, and definitely considering getting one soon or waiting for the Note 10.
Why is it that no body speaks about how thick this phone is?
The note 9 that you got thats dangeruos
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78&amp;t=62">1:02</a> Anyone got a link for that wallpaper?
Is this a voice over??? Lol
Guess what I just got..!!!
It will get warm. Water cooling doesn&#39;t make heat magically disappear. Why are all of you phone reviewers mistaking water cooling for magic? <br><br>It simply spreads and dissipates thermal energy, not make it disappear. The benefit to doing this is that heat is taken away from critical components and its spread over a larger area where the overall heat wont affect the phone performance or longevity as much.
How can I track my screen on time?? Thx guy&#39;s.
How do you get fortnite on this thing? Thank you guys in advance
Give me an unlocked bootloader, and Samsung would have another loyal customer. Until then, nope.
Bought it yesterday
Wait where did you get your wallpaper
samsung is way better than iphone!
Bixby spilled the beans.. am I the only person to have caught that reference?
Does anyone else with a Note 9 or S9 notice issues with displaying gradients on the screen? Or is it just me?
My dad is telling me that Samsung phones don’t have group messaging, is that true?
Who is facing black crush issues on the note 9. PS black crush is when you loose details in the dark area while watching movies....ie- night scenes...
Ummm it&#39;s not fully metal, remember it wouldn&#39;t have wireless charging if it was all metal.
When talking about storage don&#39;t forget the sd card slot
Im happy with my 16 gig internal storage! 😁
Que paso vato...<br>Im getting one of those in about a week..<br>Cheers
Watching this on my note 9😀
don&#39;t buy the hype, the note 9 camera lags and is unusable  in any sort of video creating.
Shall i Wait for s10 or get the note 9 rn?
Why is the huge screen behind Marques showing the loading screen of Fortnite?
Hey what&#39;s up guys? I&#39;m Kim PHD here
I use the blue light filter and it cuts battery drainage down quite a bit.
How much is it and can it be found in Lebanon???
Man I might get rid of my iPhone watching this 🤔 I’ve had Apple for 4 years and I’m reaching for something new. I literally don’t see anything new about Apple every year. Hmm Samsung might have a new customer soon 👀
apple or samsung its all about money cost them less for you to spend more . i always dont agree with thing that i say but i do agree now .. Its like when I&#39;m right I&#39;m right, when I&#39;m wrong I could been right, so I&#39;m still right cause I coulda been wrong, you know, and I&#39;m sorry cause I could be wrong right now, I could be wrong, but if I&#39;m right.
A DREAM PHONE..............
I like the blue color.  That&#39;s the one I have
