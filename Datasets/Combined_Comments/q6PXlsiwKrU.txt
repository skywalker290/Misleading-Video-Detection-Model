A super cute movie! As expected of Ayushman! I have been supporting Lgbtq+ community for a year now and the comment box makes me feel so proud of India. We are a liberal country and NO ONE must be judged or prohibited for the simple and gorgeous art of loving.
Jeetu ❤️❤️

I really hope to see more LGBT+ movies amd content in India so that people can finally be themselves and not keep on second guessing their lives the whole time.<br>Love is love ,we dont need to put it in a cage of stereotypes.

Jeetu bhaiya op
Am I the only one who hasn&#39;t watch this yet😱
Amazon Prime Video finally remembering that they were supposed to promote SMZS and not release it suddenly without creating any hype. I mean come on people, the movie, Bhoot got more promotion. And SMZS was dropped at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6PXlsiwKrU&amp;t=720">12:00</a> without any notice. Good to see that they&#39;re bringing attention to the movies and making sure it gets the audience it deserves
