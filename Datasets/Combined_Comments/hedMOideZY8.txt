The performances are outstanding, Ranbir has put everything he has into this role &amp; it&#39;s pretty evident.Well done !! Paresh Rawal &amp; Vicky Kaushal are brilliant too, specially Vicky, who would definetly be offered many more roles after this noteworthy act of his.The acting skills potrayed by everyone play an important part in hiding some of the most evident flaws of the movie.
You expect certain things from a Rajkumar Hirani movie, after all, the man just doesn&#39;t know how to make flop movies(as yet).But somewhere down the line, this movie didn&#39;t meet his standards.It&#39;s a really good movie,no doubt in that,but I personally feel it lacks a good amount of comic elements and somewhere remains restricted.
Paresh rawal...👨  ‍⚖...not so good in portraying Sunil dutt, but very good playing as a loving and supportive father<br>Handling his son with care even at times when he&#39;s caught for possessing illegal arms and when labelled as a terrorist👹🔫
His debut movie is about to be released, but he is in the US with his dad for his mom&#39;s cancer treatment and on one side his gf is about to dump him, on one side his selfish friend has already pulled him in drugs
