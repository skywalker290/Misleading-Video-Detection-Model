Looks more sad than kermit
Jävla fan
wait why is Sven;s collar red i thought it was blue what the heck
It woulda been really cool if he had put some sort of little chamber that Sven sat in and there were pressure plates on each side. so when Sven went to a certain direction, he would activate the pressure plate which would send a signal for the robot to move that direction. Idk just an idea?
You want to make it on a flat world
FAKE SVEN THE COLLAR IS RED
Mumbo jumbo crushed you btw :D

You should play “chopped” with someone, but instead of cooking supples it’s a bunch of random stuff+ red stone equipment and have a build off!
That’s not on Minecraft pocket edition
A weapon to surpass metal gear
I love you ❤
I’ve been playing Minecraft for almost a decade now and I still can’t make simple redstone contractions

Everybody see how low Sven’s tail got? Almost killed him.
Fake sven :/
Fame
Headcanon: Pewds used elytra to travel to another planet where he has the ability to summon any block, and the gravity is much weaker so he can fly. He brought even there and plays around there. When he shoots IKEA tower into space in the new episode, it lands here.

PewDiePie, we need you more than ever right now to leave this platform. COPPA should be the breaking point, if you do your research and find us a great program to migrate to everyone will be happy. Once you slowly migrate to a new platform, everyone will follow, this could be revolutionary. Even if you start slowly, like 1 video week on the new platform. Please everyone spread this message if you agree with me.
I LOVE YOU
I didn&#39;t even notice this video when it came out somehow, but I&#39;m here now :)

Looking at honey blocks kinda fucks with my eyes. They keep wanting to cross. I hope I don&#39;t get that sensation in game.
If this is me I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a fake Sven on creative mode, I&#39;m pulling out that meat and feeding him.

Me wondering why felix doesn&#39;t just make a superflat world if he flattens it anyway
Next time send Sven to space!<br><br>”Build a spaceship”
Try play Hardcore mode with friends, with a goal... and dont die
Felix I thought you were gonna collect all the mobs in broland? Finish the Japanese house, the underwater base, and so many other plans? You could also try interesting maps, or try challenges like surviving on an island?
You are doing great  😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
<b>This is the same man who dropped out of college</b>
Wow<br>I never thought I’d see pewdiepie on ad on pewdiepie vid.
Pewdiepie has his big brain glasses on!
beautiful
Now he&#39;s creating my twin
I&#39;ve been playing for 6 years and yet I&#39;m no where near pro like u r xDDD
I feel so sad the real Sven is dead
me throughout the entire video : felix what IS that
Felix, the reason people don&#39;t like this video, is that people already have better sources for construction..<br>You simply lack anything funny when it&#39;s such a simple video
So where’s the RLcraft episode huh
Missed opportunity to say &quot;this is the command sven-ter
If I can stream bts MVs I can stream this video for u felix &lt;3
Make giant moving kangaroo
I think this sort of thing appeals to a very specific audience, and that&#39;s why it didn&#39;t do as well. I didn&#39;t necessarily care for it, but it always makes me happier when Felix is happily doing something he enjoys.
This is very strange why the Minecraft videos aren&#39;t reaching people.
Sven during the video had a low tail, and the lower the tail the less health the dog has, do that means poods was abusing sven before the video started<br><br>Pewdiepie : <b>sad swedish man npises</b>
I like the regular minecraft series better. 😁
pewds makes a mech in minecraft?
Rip pewdiepie 2.3m views and 201m subs...yo what the hell happened? All dem kids done grown up

Pews: being sad that this video didn&#39;t do as well as he wanted<br><br><br>Me: likes, comments, and watches all the way through bc I feel bad and want him to to be happy
If I smash the like button it won&#39;t exist
Love the video!
This was cool
Look it up ( we shut down a call centre in India! ) it’s your double
I found your double pewdiepie and he fought tseries ( we shut down a call centre  in India)
Me: <b>watches pewds video about his comment section.</b><br>Me: <b>goes back to video to make sure I liked it because he seemed really sad about it</b>
This was a lot of effort... Ill give you that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5JBZk-DiQU&amp;t=535">8:55</a> thats what she said
👏
“We’ll build Sven a giant Ulla Brita...”<br>Translation-We’ll build Sven a giant wool bitch
In the thumbnail svens collar isn’t blue
build a floating marzia pie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5JBZk-DiQU&amp;t=130">2:10</a> Get in the boat
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5JBZk-DiQU&amp;t=423">7:03</a> looooop
I haven&#39;t watched Pewds in a few months, so I&#39;m genuinely wondering- what happened to him not using build mode?
Anyone else here cause pewds complained this video didn&#39;t do well in LWIAY?
This is so wholesome and adorable. I love the creative builds, they really let you express your ideas! Please keep making videos like this!
WHY SVEN DOES NOT HAVE BLUE COLLAR<br><b>ANGRY NOISES</b>
Walking chungus
Why is this the coolest thing I’ve seen?
I love seeing Felix actually having fun and I feel guilty for skimming through the video.
These are funny. Like and sub to Jabba the Julia 😉
Lol &quot;ThAtS  tHe FuN sTuFf&quot;
I Come To This Video To Say Hello
Mumbo’s addiction to honey blocks: not healthy<br>My addiction to hating redstone: healthy
We&#39;re back, Pewds. Happy now?
We can have howl&#39;s moving castle in minecraft?<br>WHAT!?
Y los suptitulos en español &gt;:(
Quote comments are super original and not cringy at all 👌
Sven: <b>almost suffocates in moving Redstone leg and then falls and survives</b><br> My dog: <b>suffocated in a lilypad and sand</b>  and then dies
This video needs to have one million likes because he put so much effort in it

&quot;this comment section is so horrible&quot;<br><br>Everyone:hmmhmhmmmmhmhmhmmh
I&#39;m here because in the last video he said he put a lot of effort in this one.
Build a creeper because that’s what always kills sfen
Thank you Felix for the Swedish counting lesson.
As much as this video flopped, it&#39;s so fun to see pewds genuinely enjoying something so much. Please do more redstone vids/things you enjoy rather than things you think you should do because people want you to.
