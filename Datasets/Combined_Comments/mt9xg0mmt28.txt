❤❤❤❤❤❤
Я никакой флешки никому не отдавала. Особенно таким как Гарри или тогаши. Это ложь
Сатана
Если путин сдох кого хоена еще ошивается в РФ?
Гнида
Гореть тебе в алу ща ложь
Так как будто уже все<br> Он убил меня. Избавился
Почему Путин врёт
Филипп почему вы на меея наговариваете. Это ведь Диана и Путин передали мои флешки и одну сломали. Пока я на работе была. Зашли и взяли что надо.<br>Так почему вы врете что это я отдала. Где я. Филип. Я ж мону подать на вас в суд за нарушение частной собственности и клевете
I already made it clear. I&#39;m this kind of person. I have better things to do than getting involve in a love triangle, square or whatever shape. It is not wise for my age to be in a love triangle. If given a choice, I would prefer to walk away and donate the person to the other. For me, it is not about who I love. But, who loves me.
I am manifesting my real life Aditya ❤
I think i always be here 😁 ....if someone is searching for me can find me here 😂😁
i also wantbe geet in somebodys life...yar
Who is here after kareena and Shahid eye contact 😜
He come my life i believe 5.manifest ❤
My holl life,Lost my love ageing and   ageing broke my harte 😢😢😢
Why go time, plz stop time,, if i have that possible, so i rounded,back time, 20 year&#39;s, because not enough for me😢😢😢

Not everyone can understands the purest form of love.❤️<br>Every day has a moment when I miss her. Do you know? <br>I love this pain 😌 very much because it is the only way I can feel her presence. 💝<br>Nothing is mine, except for her memories that we created.<br>I will love her until my last breath.
Life was so awesome before , we used to listen this songs on 9x channel while getting ready for school , we never thought that we will missed this moment , sometime i realized why we grown up so fast but the thing is nothing is permanent in this world, life is like a river it keep going never look back , todays smartphone generation will never understand how we used to enjoy little things when we had nothing , sorry for such long message <br>                         --Boy from old generation❤
Todays generation will never understand why this movie is a masterpeace🥺❤
