مزعجين هذا الاشهار خلاصنا منه

DP back then maaaaaaaaan❤❤❤
Firstly I love Priyanka she has been an inspiration to me and many other <br>Upon watching this after ages, now it feels like Priyanka knew it would be one of her last performances and she kind of handed her roles in the Industry to Deepika before moving out of Bollywood <br>Feels like this was her Farewell song hence she was so emotionally expressive in her performance
🙏🙏🙏🙏@🦋🦋
Salute to Shreya ji...❤🙏
Yes
❤❤❤👍👍
Super song and dance
Anyone 2024 ?
When my siter was small she loved this song😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I Am cute and good boy
Is this lavani dance?
I can just imagine Madhuri and Aishwarya dance to this same song 😊

Dont worry. You are not one listening this masterpiece in 2024.❤
My favorite Hindi singer in Sri Lanka is Shreya Ghoshal. Deepika Padukone is also a crush❤
Who&#39;s voice is portrayed by whom? Or which part is sung by which singer? It&#39;s very hard to differentiate
Fun fact: Initially whole song was shot on shreya&#39;s voice later vaishali sang her part and it got added to final song. <br>You can watch bts of the song where deepika is also lip syncing on shreya&#39;s voice.
So beautiful so 🥀🥀🥀❤❤
Pinga
This song took me back to 2018
Aaaaaaa thu
I don&#39;t like this song
Fucking song
Shreya Ghoshal 🎉❤

Those eyes of Priyanka depicts the pain of all those who met with an betrayal 😢..The best dialogues
❤
Best choreography.....❤
Laudable performance.
Pahle baar dono ko sath dekha hai main to 😮😂

This duo is special
Rajinikanth&#39;s regal walk would likely be perceived as more impactful and memorable in a movie context compared to a heroine&#39;s catwalk, given its association with power, confidence, and authority that align with his iconic on-screen persona.
Many people think this is the top dance song
Yes, there is a stereotype in film and media that men typically look better than women in action scenes. This stereotype often reflects traditional gender roles and societal expectations about physical strength and combat prowess. However, there are many examples of women excelling in action roles and defying this stereotype.<br><br>ChatGPT 🌹
This is better than Dola Re.
Yes, there is a stereotype that women generally look better than men while dancing. This stereotype is based on cultural norms and perceptions, but it&#39;s important to remember that individual skill and style vary widely regardless of gender.<br><br>ChatGPT<br><br><br>Good they did not make raghav dance in adhipurush

All this because of that kundhavai vs nandini head on head fighting in tamil. Kundhavai wins. Posted on FB.
Zaira Wasim was a hindu. Things like that
I have not watched kerala stories
No offense below
More conspiracy theory : if a muslim woman removes her burqa and looks more beautiful than a hindu woman she has converted from hindu. Heads I win Tails you lose. My pick is PC here.

❤
Both are dancing very well
@vina_van bagus nih gerakannya kak😊

Priyanka literally looked like marathi, she is so beautiful. She literally made us feel kashi bai&#39;s pain and deepika as Mastani uff😫🤌 but truly Priyanka as kashi bai is such a blessing 🙌 💖

I think the name of this movie should be&quot;The Kashi Bai&quot;
In Cuban slang is a very bad word pinga lol 😂
They don&#39;t dancing with thé face experestion je like madhui ans ashwarya,i did not feel the expressions
Priyanka and Deepika are just AMAZING ❤️
Qwetryiopsdfghkljzxcvbnm
Shreyas voice gives goosebumps ❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉
Very good
Deepika has such a great dance repertoire to her name in her films. Kathak, Ghoomer and then Lavani here.
Like virat kohli and Rohit sharma jodi
❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊
Just saying, if my husband&#39;s innocent beloved rocked up to my house swinging her graceful hips, I&#39;d be praying for something but his long life definitely would not be it.
a real masterpiece of all times.... Never ages with time😊
Everybody is appreciating Shreya but No one even Talking about Vaishali Mhade, other female singer who sang for Deepika.
🎉 super dance❤😊
Any cubans that can relate? 😅
Best dance +song ever
First Dola re and now pinga, shreya ghoshal rocks❤
Wow what a song nice song
Batch of 2019 😊❤St Mary&#39;s Girl&#39;s hit like if you know you know 😊😊
Priyanka is my favourite....so beautiful
Hey, just found this from Instagram.  I have no idea what&#39;s going on, but the singing and dancing are amazing.
Please movie ka nem dalo na
The lyrics are just 🔥🔥
indian version of Disney Frozen, Elsa and Anna,This is wonderful😌
my toxic trait is thinking i can do the choreography for this with little to no effort
In some scenes when they are dancing together the ladies are not always in sync. This made the song look a bit natural and their execution is just exceptional with touch of Shreya ji and Vaishali ji voices ❤❤
Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra TWO Performers In One Frame😍😘🥵
😍😍😍😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗💞
Sreya goshal ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I remember going to cinema with my oldest cousin to watch this movie when it was released, I was a kid and it was really lit. Man that was awesome.
Priyanka nailed it
👍👍
Imagine your husband is in love with another woman abs brings her to his house !!!? 😮no it’s painful song … smh I’m Indian and the society is very male chauvinist.
LOVE the song from Andhra Pradesh

Mil beijos aqui do Brasil para Índia! Amo seus filmes! ❤ Chorei tanto pelas duas, história linda ❤
Muje bhi asa lag ta hi ke priangka or dipika dono behan ha
Priyanka Chopra deserved more appreciations and credits for the class of acting she did in the movie.
Priyanka Chopra❤ what a performance😍 she slayed it❤❤❤
When I was little I think this song sings by dipika and priyanka 😂😂😂
It&#39;s just the magic of shreya mam voice  ❤❤
I really into this song the dance makes me so energized
Vaishali Mhade voice ❤❤❤❤❤
This song is a masterpiece and the Marathi culture is been shown in this song and how before this song kashi invites mastani to the event and welcomes her in the event.
Both vaishali and shreya have good voice❤
I prefer Deepika, in general, but Priyanka Chopra’s dance and grace in this song is unmatchable
Listening this masterpiece now!♥️
Team  Kashi all the way 🥰
Back sceneحبايب حبايب قدام الناس الد أعداء ❤

Devdas evlenmis bu o versiyon ama yine delirdi,bu kadar put ve ikonun oldugu yerde delirmemesi mucize olurdu,cinlenmis resmen kurtulamaz.
I like it song😊😮❤
Shreya and vaishali ki awaz same hai dono mein pehchan pana mushkil ho rha hai mere liye ki Shreya konsi line mein hai aur vaishali konse line me 🤣🤣
I love this song 😍💖😊
such a beautiful song with two leadind actresses
Well here we go the twins are here I thought they were related mmh 👀
There&#39;s a message here, let&#39;s not forget that with understanding and compassion we can dance and be happy together ! :) Regardgless of any differences.

I am African and honestly I can say Indian women are definition of grace and beauty. Indian culture is BEAUTIFUL, God bless.

cant get single word of this Song, but i love this Song , its sad , Romantic and Energetic at the same time. Love from UAE
Ola
Priyanka grace is something else
Shreya mam 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ñll
How are no Mexicans cracking up in the comments about the title of this song?😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzRFLMn4kpM&amp;t=130">2:10</a>
😊😊😊😇💗💗💘
❤ what a song
When the wife no other choice but to accept the mistress
Alguien sabe como se llama la peli
I still have associations with dancing to the song &quot;Re dola&quot; from the movie Devdas
Pinga and dola re are two masterpieces by most talented actresses.....<br>And both are from SLB 💖💕
pinga
No words
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzRFLMn4kpM&amp;t=171">2:51</a> mere jiya me utari tune pehni piya ki katari 😥

Nice song❤❤❤🎉

en latan suena raro pero bonita melodia :D
Very good dancer
oh yeah boy
😮🎉😢😮😅😊😊😅🎉😂😂
❤❤❤
I danced to  this song in my class7th at annual day❤❤❤❤❤. This song is so special😘😘😘😘
Can&#39;t focus on one bhaiiii matlb itna acha dance literally haaye 👀❤️
Bajirao missed this song😅😅
Prianka ❤❤❤love you pc
History repeats two women dancing for one man just like madhuri aiswariya in devdas 😂
I dont know what I would have done if my husband gets another girl and says she&#39; his new wife.....probably set a funeral and decide the venue along with my new sister..!...😂😅😂😅
❤❤❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzRFLMn4kpM&amp;t=102">1:42</a> How are they touching hands to feet,  I tried but couldn&#39;t
Priyanka Dipika nice dance  nice voice 👌👌👌😍👍🔥🔥🔥
Im from argentina and i love the song and the dance of india is beautiful
Nick Jonas after seeing this &quot;I am going to make her my wife STAT&quot;
can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 7 year complete I  used this song  to dance  when I was in school at 6 std it was group dance now  I am in 2nd year of graduation this song  reminds me the all   memories of school and those friends 😭

Priyanka looks more Maharashtrian woman than authentic maharashtrian woman❤
escucho pinga like si es verdad
Why it&#39;s look like dola re form davedas
priyanka or deepika my favourite
2023 me v kon kon ye gana sun rha 😂🎉🎉
After Lata G my favorite female singer Shreya Ghoshal❤️
This our Marathi culture 😍
अचानक मुझे एहसास हुआ कि हम भारतीय कितने रंगीन हैं<br> , भारतीय संस्कृति इतनी उदार और इतनी जीवंत है .. प्रत्येक राज्य का अपना अनूठा नृत्य है जो देखने वालों को मंत्रमुग्ध कर देता है ...<br>  यह मेरे भारत की शान है।  आप एक राज्य की समृद्ध संस्कृति के बारे में इतना ही नहीं सोच सकते हैं कि 28 राज्यों और 8 केंद्र शासित प्रदेशों के अंत तक किसी को यह महसूस होगा कि जन्म लेने का उद्देश्य पूरा हो गया है और अब मुक्त हो जाएगा।  मेरी सुंदर भारत मां अमर रहे और उसकी समृद्ध संस्कृति और विविधता अक्षुण्ण रहे और हीरे की तरह चमकती रहे।  आप सभी को परफॉर्म करते देख सचमुच मेरे रोंगटे खड़े हो गए थे।  तुम लड़कियाँ परी हो..proud to be an Indian ❤❤
Awesome movie! Awesome song!
Lmao this name of this song &quot;pinga&quot; in my country means &quot;dick/cock&#39;. I wonder what does it mean in India.😂😂😂😂
Priyanka not only kills this one far more than Deepika but also carries the whole film on her shoulders. ❤ bajirao isn&#39;t for mastani but it&#39;s kashibai all the way
Maturity is when you realize Bajirao-Mastani isn’t a love story.. it’s the story of an extra marital affair which made innocent Kashibai’s life a nightmare
I like it this dance ❤
Priyanka’s expressions are top tier and Deepika is very graceful.
I thought they didnt like each other...?
Kon Kon yeh song 2023 or 2024 mein sun raha hai yah sunega
Just Their Dance 👀❤️
Deepika Padukone nice actress ❤
Bajiraos wife Kashibai having problem in her leg, how can she able to dance like this? <br>Unether thig is mastani is muslim and Kashibai is brahmin there is untechebilty on those days how first Lady  prime ministers wife can dance with her sautan. 😅
Just like madhuri and aishwariya in dola re...these two just amazing
Nice❤
A gana mujhe bhi bahut pasand atha hai 💐💐
Love the dance moves
Beautiful 😍
Anyone objerve same &quot;dola re dola&quot; dance strategy is use in this song also..... That time top actresses aish and madhuri and this time also both top Bollywood actresses
One of my most favourite song in bollywood
Nic
How Shreya Ghosal taking breath....no time for breath in starting
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
😍😍😍😍
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
👌👌👌👌👌
❤❤❤❤❤❤
me  gusta pinga
What royalty is those dance moves. And these two actresses and the entire crew rocked it. ❤
❤❤❤
Yrrrrr ye song dykh k afsos hota hai Kashi Ben k lye 😢
The Mahatashtrian Culture🥰❤
Sherya ghoshal voice  is amazing❤❤❤❤
This is painful at all levels…..how gracefully put into a song ❤

Where can I watch this movie? 😩
Bhansali wants to recreate the magic of dola re.. But he himself knows that can not done again.. This song also masterpiece but never match the swag what aish &amp; madhuri creates
Eros 2023 repeat.....
I love the song but I wish it wasn&#39;t about 2 wives and stúpidity I don&#39;t support these things (misogynistic things)
This is my favourite song and I am very happy for you to come ❤️🥰 and 🎉🥰❤️👍☺️🔚🤝😂🍫😍😀🤪💓👃😜👏😋🙂😌💃🌹💞👊🙏🫂👋😘📸📸😊😁🤗🤷

Dance ye sab toh thik h . Lekin real life mai sautan ek saath acche se reh he nhi sakte .🤣🤣
Terrible experience for a woman to know that her husband loves any other woman.
After dola re dola song this song has set that standard 🔥
This song is very sweet.❤❤❤
I love Indian song 😊❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My baby sister loves it 😍😍😍💖💖💖💖
Deepika didn&#39;t look good in this outfit 😂 she looked good in Anarkali but Priyanka looked really classy.
&quot;Meray ghar ayi meray piya ki saawri&quot;, damn those lyrics tho😭
😮
Wow, that’s impressive!
Everyone taking about Priyanka and Dipika dance but no-one can talk about shreya ghosal and vaishalibeautiful singing ❤😊 what a song a masterpiece ❤💞💖💗
👌
Deepika Padukone was flawless in her moves. Very Gracious ❤.
If you see back dancer you realise they are doing better than lead actresses
Their bond in this song reminds me of <b>Paro and Chandramukhi</b> in dola re dola song
I love this song 🎉😮😮😮
Deepika is a stiff dancer and not as good in classical dance. SLB could not recreate magic of Dola re with this one. Bajirao is Priyanka&#39;s show all the way with her solid acting
EROS ALWAYS LOVE YOU😊
Abhi like nahin patcher😊
Like nahin

You guys now that pinga means dick in Spanish
मैं आज भी तय कर नही पा रहा हु की माधुरी और अश्वरिया ने बेस्ट डांस किया है या दीपिका और प्रियंका ने
Wonder Nick J. is thinking of this.<br>If i was related to Priy or Deepika, I would be very proud of these 2 talented women!!! Plus, i love these two! ❤❤🎉🎉😊😊
Shreya Ghoshal 💗💗🙌🏻
My favourite song😊

Deepika is the most beautiful woman to ever walk the earth, fight me if you want!

When you watch this movie again just for kashi
Karena jika kamu tau aku pemeran jika kalian aku di selamatkan di sesi vii kalian juga tinggal di vii nanti akan di selamatkan tapi jika kalian ga selamatkan aku maka aku juga tidak
Tergantung mereka biarkan aku kesakitan atau tidak maka dunia akan berlaku sama dengan mu seperti itu
Karena permintaan tolong ku adalah permintaan tolong kaliann nanati saat sakit dan buta seperti aku dan jelek
Bila kalian beri bantuan padaku artinya nanati di dunia kalian pasti aku menyelamatkan kalian pas buta dan sakit tapi kalian biarkan aku sampai aku mati pagi bangun pun masih di bunuh bila. Kalia. Bunuh aku maka kalian juga akan di bunuh seperti aku
Jangan bilang aku di sakit kaliannnanti ga mencoba memberi kesempatan agar aku menyelamatkan kalian nanti aku udah beti kesempatan tapi kalian biarkan aku matanya di colok sampai mati pagi pagi lagi gitu terus aku seperti kalian nanti merasa sakit tak ada yang perdulikqn kalian juga akan merasa seperti aku aku telah ulurkan ya gan meminta bantuan dunia tapi dunia menyimpan tangannya rapat rapat nanati aku juga akan seperti kalian menyimpan tangan ku rapat rapat
❤❤❤ i relly like this song &amp; dipika &amp; priyanka most matching as maduri &amp; aishwariya❤❤❤
Seluruh surga datang tak berwujud sebagai jiwa jadi kalian akan mati dasiem membunuhku terus
acting to dono ki achi h yr but dance thoda sa lack sa lagra h
am i only one who think wife of Bajirao wont dance like this and this whole movie is shit
My favorite song
Itc akan bangkit untuk sejumlah festival surga dunia bukan neraka jadi kalian harus tau itc 23 surga akan turun ke bumi
Kalian buat aku kayak yama guci pasti dia yang menari denganku
Yana guci punya tugas sangat penting di Jakarta karena harus menari dengan ku dan sejumlah acara dunia dan kembali abadi di rumah itc
Kalian lonte ga pantas menari dengan ku
Nanti itu yama guci dari surga dans sama aku bukan kalian hanya untuk dans itu
Biarin aj maina kepala aku aku sihir kan lagunya jadi binatang kalian guwekin kepalaku
Jadi buat mainan ahh
Lonte sibuk bunuh bunuh dari awal udah main kian main orang ratu jadi makanan
Sok ngerusak rambut bukain kerudung orangnya di bunuh di gebukin magicnya di sebar semua ya abis lah mati mereka jadi bintang ga bakal bisa jadi manusia acara itu kalian
Magic mereka di sebar sebar semua orang jagalan aku buatan jadi abis di buang orang jadi kayu jadi debu
Mereka nyuruh aku ketawa tawa make wig jadi gendon jelek dasiem sama jugini mau nyamar jadi aku aku di gendon dia rencanakan pemaksaan acara itu di tempat bagus gedung angsa dan dia mau membuat kisah itu jadi miliknya dan dia ga bisa bahasa itu pasti mati karena merrka dasiem turman  dia juga mau jadi kacori binggel udah dibilang lanjutannya jadi binatang keluarga bencong ga bisa balik jadi manusia
Mereka nyuruh aku ketawa tawa make wig jadi gendon jelek dasiem sama jugini mau nyamar jadi aku aku di gendon dia rencanakan pemaksaan acara itu di tempat bagus gedung angsa dan dia mau membuat kisah itu jadi miliknya dan dia ga bisa bahasa itu pasti mati karena merrka dasiem turman  dia juga mau jadi kacori binggel udah dibilang lanjutannya jadi binatang keluarga bencong ga bisa balik jadi manusia

i remeber watching this in 2018
This is traditional maharashtrain mangalagavar dance ladies do during the month of shravan or even when gauri ganpati at home. But in this they have shown in a typically Bollywood style.
I love this song 🤩💕
Shreya Ghoshal voice nd lyrics❤ plus these two beautiful ladies💞dancing with such perfection ✨🤩 Speechless😍💓
Pc has nailed it
Fan Of Combo Of Sanjay lila bhansali and Dipika
❤️
Lo único que sé es que no me puedo morir sin antes haberme aprendido todo este baile fhsjfjs.
Indians have denied us sweet moments for generations by abolishing their monarchy.<br>I can&#39;t even visualize how mesmerizing their royal events would be
Wow nice ☺️☺️❤❤❤❤😊😊💋💋💋🥰🥰😘😘🥰

Maturing is realizing that Kashi Bai was the only innocent person who deserved happiness,in the movie. Bajirao and Mastani both deserved how they died,if not worse.

THEY REALLY LOOK ALIKE I LOVE YOU ❤❤
I couldn’t take my eyes off Deepika❤
I&#39;ve always wanted to see them both rock stars dance ❤
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day!
Just Maharastra things ❤❤❤❤❤
Priyanka is best❤
Both are looking very beautiful in marathi traditional look

96 kulo saman kidhar hai buva Kai hai 2023
I Love you Prinyaka chopra
I remember  my childhood memories. Pinga dance is still favourite for us.
Donc dans les clairs se ne sont pas normalement des blancs des premières vagues hindous malgré que les hautes castes ne se mélangent pas trop. Y a eu des faux zooastriens de perse plus des souffi chiites sunnite d asie central, d Afghanistan et de perse qui sont devenu hindous apres avoir été influencer par leur mauvais esprits plus peut-être des huns venu pas longtemps avant les arabes. Une fois que vous entrez dans la cours des djinns sa peut partir loin. La preuve aujourd&#39;hui avec certains kabbaliste complètement ravager du cerveau ils sont totalement manipuler et soumi. Bah nous on reste soumi à l&#39;islam El hamdoullilah
Extraordinary voice shreya mam❤
I love this song
Dola re dola re and this is my all time fvrt❤❤❤❤❤

Bad song
এই সিনেমার নাম টা কি,,, আমি দেখতে চাই
it is amazing how they didn&#39;t forget to add the rumbling sounds of the fire when the camera is passing near the fires... for example in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzRFLMn4kpM&amp;t=195">3:15</a>
Pinga means dick in my country tho☠️

Salam two stars of Indian cinema
Saagio shewta tiwariko lekar hum bohot tension mein. Oska aak v shadi sahi nehi hoia. English culture ka larka dhoondo oor shantika shadi do.<br>Osko kam nehi milta. Meri vai beheno duniaka saabse khubsorat insaano mein. Aanjjise jada khobsorat kuch aaj v nehi dunia mein. I am so thankful to indian government  because i get u all from the most top and high ranked  officers of the India. Most powerful biological fathers of the India. India never spoil a single egg of my mom. U all are Super rich. Without shewta tiwari. Jenifer winget. <br>A a baano minister baano aap saab..
❤❤
Me pareció bien, pero no buenísimo, creo que nada le va a ganar a derola, de aishawria y madhuri, la coreografía era más difícil por así decirlo, aparte que ellas dos se parecían más
Shreya will give voice to which of these two?
Wah shriya g kamal ha ap mind-blowing 🔥 voice.
very very beautiful!!
From egypt so much love ❤ such a beautifull😢

Priyanka nailed her character.... <br>Deepika portrayed Mastani but Priyanka lived her character of Kaashibaai .. Love you PC ❤
Priyanka 😍
𝘽𝙚𝙖𝙪𝙩𝙮 𝙊𝙛 𝙈𝙖𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙝𝙞 𝙇𝙖𝙣𝙜𝙪𝙖𝙜𝙚
Pahle history padh lo FIR movie banao<br>History  ko barbad kar diya😢
I don&#39;t know but for me Priyanka did the choreo better then Deepika. She didn&#39;t miss a beat
Hermanas de leche
Nice song 🎵
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤

Super
Indians I&#39;m in love with you
Even after all this time... Bajirao Mastani is an unmatched classic movie &amp; though Deepika ma&#39;am - ranveer sir nailed their characters immaculately.... This will forever belong to Priyanka ma&#39;am
PC has danced well on Marathi beat ❤
Love Did ...🎉😢❤ from sri lanka 🇱🇰🇱🇰
Lo
Unbelievable dance
Спасибо за вашу песню  я  поднею танцую соло
I think background dancers work more harder than these two heroine😮
Какой же это с визуальной составляющей эстетичный и красивый фильм❤ А музыкальные сцены заслуживают отдельной похвалы🤩✨
bonita canción
Pura pinga la cancion
T
That <b>pinga gapori</b> par is just the thing 🎉❤❤❤
did you notice the resemblance between this song and dola re dola(from devdas). one actress is miss world another is portraying a mistress in movie. both directed by sanjay leela bhansali one is in Bengali, another in Marathi
Les.😂😂😂
2023
Both are deevaas❤❤❤
👌👌👌👌❤❤
Rani padmavati [Padmavati devi] showed  courage , strength , braveness and skill fulness that srilankan girl Has. I think the price gift that india recived from srilanka is padmavati devi.🙏🌺🌺
they should&#39;ve left bajirao and gotten together
না ই চ
This is a first comment section which appreciates everything--&gt; the actors, backgrounds dancers, singer, choreography❤
Priyanka&#39;s eyes 🥺
1 Nacho nacho of girls
I still don&#39;t get it. Is it mastani&#39;s imagination or she actually went there to dance with Kashi?
😊😊😊😊

What amazing camera work!!!!
pinga en español significa pen..e  <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw"></a>
Gives Dola re vibes
Hi! don&#39;t worry.. you&#39;re not the only one listening to this masterpiece in 2023!
omg i cant belive why is it always mr Sanjay Bhansali giving the best music movie choreo and  cast he is marvellous hope to see more directors in india with such a rich taste
Deepika is a great actress and amazing dancer , but Priyanka Chopra showed the difference in levels... Ngl even in the dance that was visible prominently.
My cousin first heard this song as Ninja Hatoori.😂
The choreography was amazing fantabulous magical 💖
Gave their best...but no one can beat Aishwarya and Madhuri bonding 🔥❤️
The choreography from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzRFLMn4kpM&amp;t=60">1:00</a> is SO GOOD, and the music!!!? This is done so well I love it
Bollywood and hollywood dono jagah dono ne dhamaka macha rakha hai🤩🤩👌👌😎😎.
Bhai ye song bna kon ra h...❤ masterpiece ❤
Deepika looks so clumsy and stiff dancing.
I was trying to dance this exact choreography. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzRFLMn4kpM&amp;t=90">1:30</a> min I am in and I am all sweaty, tired and what not. My legs hurt. You can&#39;t fathom the energy unless you try it.
nadia sinh is great at dancing too!!!
Just finished the movie, this scene remains the best
Priyanka is beautiful
Shreya mam outstanding 🎉
Hiii
Radha rumkmini and krishna story 😢
T series , please don&#39;t ruin this masterpiece song with  Neha Kakkar
Dola re vs Pinga ?
When two Queens met,  a blast of performance occurred, so phenomenal, Priyanka, Deepika,SLB,Shreya,choreographers n all who participated in the making of this fabulous masterpiece
The songs has a unique calmness in it. Yet you can even dance crazily on it. Unfortunate that it doesn&#39;t have an Oscar like naatu naatu.
Legends listening in 𝟚𝟘𝟚𝟛
To anyone who has not noticed the importance of colour in their costumes. Deepika is wearing bright red colour outfit while Priyanka is wearing a bit dull violet colour outfit. It basically trying to reflect them as one as “new” and the other one as “old”. It has a metaphorical connection, Deepika’s outfit was chosen this colour to symbolise the new profound love and Priyanka’s outfit symbolises as an old love that got faded. <br><br>This was explained by my dance teacher to her daughter and then she shared it with me. <br><br>Its beautiful how colours can be used as a way of communicating.
Nice song attractive
priuankas expression and dipikas graceful dance
Really marathi culture is one of the best culture <br>Jay maharashtra
Awesome 🎉❤
The real magic begins at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzRFLMn4kpM&amp;t=137">2:17</a>
deepika&#39;s dance with shreya&#39;s voice... the best combo
Nau Song
Just like Dola re dola song❤❤❤❤❤
Priyanka Chopra &gt; Deepika
Nostalgia😢
Bas yahi chahiye life mein, ek sath do nachaani hain 🤣🥹
Deepika dance like a bamboo stick.😂😂😂
PRIYANKA totally overshadowed deepika
AMAZING 🤩🤩🤩 <br>I DANCE ON THIS SONG SOOOOOOO EXLENT!
The Collaboration is 🔥🔥🔥
Before naacho naacho most sync dance
Shreya❤
I don&#39;t know Hindi, but still love this song and coreo. Wow what an amazing pair
My god their acting skills their eyes speaks alot about their character …..one of the finest performances of DP and PC ❤
Let&#39;s take a moment to appreciate the &quot;diye&quot; in the background
This dance reminds me of dance on &#39;dola re&#39; song performed by aishwarya rai and madhuri dixit 😊😊
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzRFLMn4kpM&amp;t=73">1:13</a>
I watch this all the time and I don’t know anything about this movie
Director Mr. Sanjay sir, must read this comment, the song is extremely beautifully done and they both priyanka and Dipika gave their bestest of best. But throught the song what is unpleasant to my eyes is the difference between their heights, thats making little differece in their moves.. It seems little bit sticky.. Otherwise over all the song is great and beautifully done.. We love your work sajay sir.❤.
Evergreen!
❤❤❤❤❤
Nice song

What a song?
World&#39;s best choreography ❤<br>I couldn&#39;t control my eyes when Deepika madam start dancing
Deepika always nail the dance parts even if it is classical or western, she performs like a pro🤍
Se asemeja al baile de Aishwayra Rai y la otra actriz que hizo de prostituta en la película Devdas
पिंगा
as a maharashtrian and a maratha girl, i love the representation here.
I really miss prianka and Deepika . They were brilliant and mind blowing.
Hats off to cherograper
This quality of production now missing in Bollywood
Priyanka Deepika se badi star h
👼❤❤❤💋❤
Aajii
Aaliya anju.
Reedan reedhan pareshan.
Pinga panda.
The only difference between Priyanka and dipika that Deepika dances with body and smile or be tearful... But Priyanka dances with body and face her eyes switched 10 expressions in every step ❤
Can&#39;t take my eyes from these both ladies❤ still this song gives me ghossbumps ❤
😊😊😅
Kon si movie hai
Who are here in 2023?
Priyanka 😍
‏‪<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzRFLMn4kpM&amp;t=68">1:08</a>‬‏  i
What a movie it is all emotions are included in this film. Every body behind the Bahubali and RRR . actually it is getting big success just because of promotion and marketing. Other than that nothing is there.
Nice  performance
Two women celebrating one man&#39;s love..so beautiful ❤
Anyone in 2023 attendance like 😀👇
i think even the real queens also might not be  beautiful than these actresses👌🏻❤️
In Spanish pinga means dick 😅😂
Priyanka is outstanding
The dola re dola of our generation 😘
I absolutelly lose my shit when indians do their little head bop/shake middle dance, is SUCH a clear human expression of happiness and fun, it&#39;s so cute.
My all time favourite song ❤❤❤❤❤. What a song,dance,music😢❤❤❤❤
Priyanka is looking beautiful
😍😍😍👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Fantastic song
I cm again seeing d reharchl vdeo on reels 😇💌
Only priynka play best Marathi girl role ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Maturity is when you realize this song and lyrics depicts jealousy and sarcasm🙃
This is song when both of them realised that problem is not one of them but it&#39;s Bajirao...👀
Watching in 2023❤
Dp is brilliant but Priyanka is class apart
Most amazing women to ever exist in Bollywood
KKK
Bro this is my favorite childhood song i love this no matter which age i am cause I will be 10  this year which is 2023
Shreya is my most favourite female singer
Marathi song🎉🚩🚩,,rada❤
I love this song very much
Priyanka is so graceful, my god ❤️
is this marathi dance? why it is using so much of kathak🤣🤣
In this movie only priyanka is best and correct
Padua Re Dinga🌹🌹🌹😄🌹🌹🌹
<b>Dear parents: Just because your child is smiling at their phone, doesn&#39;t mean they have a boyfriend or girlfriend, they are watching this masterpiece!</b>
This film is so sad to watch as a desi woman. I feel like we all grew up watching our mum, aunts, sisters, cousins or grandmas crying because of their husbands. Men in our culture get away with a lot of things like infidelity which women don’t. We all know a Kashi irl or we are the Kashi
maturity level: realizing mastani was a problem
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzRFLMn4kpM&amp;t=137">2:17</a>
Casting, costumes, set, direction and many more things to say...<br>SLB movies are always pleasing to the eye
Priyanka Play kashibai character  with our 👀 eye&#39;s 👍💯
Priyanka ❤️
Wahh wahh kya dance hai
Mere piya ki sawari 🥺
Pinga🤑
Priyanka ...so cute ..👌👍❤
Who loves Deepika Padukone 😊❤
Wow just wow🤌🏻 so much beauty in the dance❤️❤️❤️
I love Indian dance
But prinka is best

The difference between national award winning actress and chhapris group actress
It&#39;s 2023 still vibing on this song
Pinga songs remembered Dhola re song 👍💯
Priyanka dance is fabulous 👍💯
Her lips smile<br>Her eyes very sad 😢<br>Priyanka Chopra what a performance
Some singer have <b>sweet voice</b><br>Some singer have <b>perfect control over voice</b><br>Some singer have <b>ability to hit the perfect notes</b><br>Some singer can sing any <b>genre</b><br>Some singer are <b>versatile</b> <br>Some singer can sing in <b>20+ language</b> <br>Some singer can sing <b>classical</b> song<br>Some singer can sing <b>item</b> song<br>Some singer can sing <b>romantic</b> and <b>sad</b> song<br><br>❤️❤️❤️<br><b>Shreya Ghoshal has all of these quality</b> <br>❤️❤️❤️
Who saw this song again in 2023 is the best ??
What Is The Meaning Of This Song 💀
the women trauma bonding 🥺
#
like me personally i would never dance with the woman my man cheated on me with but as long as y&#39;all happy ....
Gazab Tora Dinga🌹🌹🌹
Like madhuri and aichwarya in Devdas
L
Priyanka is a genius actress 👍💯
😍😍😍
❤❤❤
Priyanka is all rounder 🔥
It&#39;s 2023 who&#39;s listening to this masterpiece 😍😍😍😍😍
Dipika dance is next level
Nepotism rocks 👎
kashibai.....(priyanka) is the bst
We dance in my school in annual day
What does pinga mean thoughhhhh? It&#39;s not exactly a nice word in Spanish😆
Priyanka nailed it
The way they move shouldn&#39;t be possible. It&#39;s so unreal 🤩
Amazing ❣️❣️
Opp hard workysgs
Everyone always talks about Shreya but I think Vaishali definitely deserves some attention as well! Her voice is so beautiful and when she’s paired with Shreya they create magic!
Mein Assam se hoon aur mein isliye proud feel karta hun kyuki humare India mein itne sare state hone ke baad bhi sabke pass apne apne rich culture hai aur sabse important baat to ye hai ki humare sabhi culture kahi na kahi ek dusre se milte jhulte hai
It&#39;s so amazing yrrr bro 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
How does the movie end please?
Can&#39;t deny the fact that PRIYANKA CHOPRA overtakes 🔥.<br>Can&#39;t take my eyes off from PC&#39;s skills in pinga 💋
❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
I m the biggest fan of Deepika mam but in this movie Priyanka mam had done fabulous job ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.....
Hindi is the best Language on earth ❤, I feel goosebumps each time I listen to India songs , lot’s of love from Nigeria 🇳🇬
Keindahan India Memang Luar Biasa
I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off Priyanka 😩 not because she played &quot;kashibai&quot; which was a truly positive character in the movie  but because she truly nailed those dance steps, she adapted that Marathi grace so well...her steps were flawless and ofc those expressions were everything 🙌
Priyanka+Deepika = Fire 🔥
❤❤
Grace n perfaction is can see in Priyankas dance.
Shriya ghosal voice is Amazing 💙💙
Vera level 🎵
Priyanka fits so perfect in all roles 💯💯
I always think that how did Kashi bai had when she knew about Mastani and bajirao
WONDERFUL ❤️❤️❤️My love from Russia ❤️🌹
Anyone wondering if Priyanka will pass down that talent to her daughter soon?
these both are like modern madhuri dixit and aishwarya rai and this gives me dola re dola song&#39;s vibes i think that&#39;s because both the songs are by shreya ghoshal...💕💕
this song alwayss hits different!!!~
Which type of dance is this
OP bot
Most beautiful song 🎵

Эти индийские актрисы прям вышка 😍😍😍😍 как глазами могут передать все боль
Why not Vaishali&#39;s name is mentioned in title ?? 🤨🤨 , I know Vaishali can take over your useless singers , so you&#39;ll not mention her name ? 😂
Beautiful 🌺🌺🌺
