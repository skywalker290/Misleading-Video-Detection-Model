Dang kids
Kids these days...
I thought this was about Tom Brady
I once lived on a very dark farm with goats. I came home late and intoxicated one dark night. I was headlight blind and trying to see my way to the house. The little goat bastard clipped me behind the knees, flipping me upside down like an NFL quarterback. The first part to make contact was my head, followed shortly by my shoulder. In the morning I went after him with a baseball bat, but as one might expect, I never got close enough to brain him. To this day, every goat I encounter knows I want to kill him.
this guy is the G.O.A.T.
Goat gangs!

Goaty MacGoatface :D
Is that Conor Mcgregor breaking in!?!??!?
At first, I thought the goat wanted to get in and when it started to break the other part of the glass door then, I realized it&#39;s a customer who had a bad experience. Management needs to address the situation. Why is the customer this mad?!

The goat probably saw another goat reflected in the glass and, as it didn&#39;t back down, saw it as a challenge. Butted heads until the goat appeared in the next window then eventually went away. Goat 2 - Reflection 0

the fucking goat LOOKED AROUND first what the fuck
Saw itself in the reflection of the glass. Very disappointed. Thought it was breaking in to do something, but it was just going about its natural instincts.

My guess is the sun made the glass reflective, and he thought it was another dude after the girls that ran off when the first door broke.
Oh man I really want to see the face of the person who thoght they got robbed or somthing, jusy to look back at the video to see a goat. Man that would of been so funny.

The goat just wanted to use the printer. What is this world we live in where we shame goats for wanting to print out their college applications and work resumes?
God I didn&#39;t know goats could join antifa

Wait is this a publicity stunt?
Goat simulator in real life
That goat is really the G.O.A.T at break-ins<br>(get it)
It just broke the windows it didn&#39;t &quot;break in&quot; know the difference
To anyone who thinks he is attacking his reflection: nope, they just like to tear things up and bash. I know this as I own a 200+ pound boer buck and he bashes anything that looks bashable to him, which is basically anything standing. Just look at this buck&#39;s tail wag, he knows he&#39;s being bad.
una
Goat is so savage that it breaks windows for a living, while I was shoplifting Twixes from Target at age eight.
This should be the promo for Goat Simulator 2

Goats these days have no respect. Back in my day they stayed in the farm and did what they were told.
But why?!
This goat will be the top salesman for Argoincs Inc for the month of July.
At least he didn&#39;t steal anything
&quot;Lovely office you have there.  It would be a shame if someone were to headbutt the glass out of your door wouldn&#39;t it?  You need protection.&quot;<br>Don&#39;t mess with the goat mafia.
Someone hates his reflection
this had me laughin. Breaks both doors and dips üòÇü§ó
Nicer than protesters these days.

This goat is a GOAT
Yo, that thief is the G.O.A.T.
49-1 G.O.A.T Anyway.. this was awesome lol
In such cases the animal such as this goat probably saw its reflection and charged it. They had this problem with moose in New York city attacking bus shelters and phone booths in the park.
Didn&#39;t quite break &quot;into&quot;...  But that was one crazy ass goat.
Farmer&#39;s insurance commercial  coming soon.
<b>Tom Brady get suspended for 4 games because of breaking and entering</b>
