Best pewdiepie this style looks better when you play games (the ratio of your camera and where its placed) and pewds please stop playing minecraft and terraria. Play a wide range of variety of games. There is assassins creed unity, uncharted 4, hitman 2, spiderman, red dead redemption 2, so many good and genuinely fun titles. Minecraft gets boring after a while and that&#39;s why you want to quit minecraft and terraria. Play whatever you want try random games

Felix: Lobsters are Crustaceans, not Arthropods. Ants are arthropods. &quot;Arthropod&quot; means &quot;joint foot&quot;. Anthropod isn&#39;t a word. If it was, it might mean &quot;human foot&quot;, but it doesn&#39;t.

What is in my avatar ?
How Pewdiepie Saved Us From The Matrix:<br><br>We live in an alternate timeline from The Matrix.  Originally the Matrix would arise as a result of the developers of the game ‚ÄúBear Simulator‚Äù‚Äôs massive success.  They became a titanic corporation that advanced VR technology hundreds of years into the future.  They also developed robots, which would eventually enslave humanity and force us into our own virtual world to be fuel, as in ‚ÄúThe Matrix.‚Äù  However since Felix played and hated their game, trashing it and causing its development to end, the developers never rose to power and created the technology that would be our downfall.  This alternate timeline will actually be discovered in the new Matrix movie, which will a central plot plot, with alternate timeline Felix as the new Neo.

Hi, there is a baby here in Brazil called Marina, who was diagnosed with a degenerative disease and needs a medicine that sells in the United States for about 2 million dollars. The value is already very large in dollars and arrives even more expensive in Brazil, costing approximately 9 million reais (the minimum wage per month is 900 reais). I came here to ask for your help because I believe you, PewDiePie and all followers can make a difference in the life of this family, they are trying very hard to get this medicine.<br><br>Marina&#39;s parents have created an instagram to publicize the cause and intend to travel to the United States when they raise it, but they must gather before she is 2 years old.<br><br>I count on you and everyone reading to accomplish what may be your greatest solidarity action.<br><br>Marina Instagram<br>@cureamarina

Felix, are you sure you didn&#39;t mean &#39;Arthropod?&#39; Arthropods are the family of crustaceans and insects while &#39;anthropods&#39; is just bipeds for the most part.
PewDiePie killed a crab which is a arthropod so does that mean he killed his own empire since he wanted the Arthropods to rise

There&#39;s something you need to know at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZddvddGEQg0&amp;t=367">6:07</a>. As a viewer of South Korea, it is not politically ill-intentioned... What you need to know is that red flag behind that submarine is a flag symbolizing Japan‚Äôs old imperialism, and if you think it means the same thing as the Nazis, you‚Äôll soon understand.<br>And the fact that such a pattern appears in the video game is heartbreaking for viewers in Korea. Thank you for watching my story so far
The attacks look like DBZ ki blasts.

Literally laughing at the thumbnail until the end of the video
I always thought it was a&quot;n&quot;thropod though I learned it is arthropod three months ago so it&#39;s okay I guess lol
Anthropods translated means human legs <br><br><br>Pewdiepie said rise of anthropods<br><br><br>Is he hinting that he is modifying his body and adding some legs?
I&#39;m the bald guy
I thought the thumbnail is pewdiepie doing ASMR
Me: I thought Pewds was on break?<br>Pewds: Do you want me to go on break?<br>Me: No! I&#39;m good
Episode two comes out next Tuesday

In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, her soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, she chose the path of perpetual torment. In her ravenous hatred she found no peace; and with boiling blood she scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged her. She wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of her sword named her‚Ä¶ satania.
