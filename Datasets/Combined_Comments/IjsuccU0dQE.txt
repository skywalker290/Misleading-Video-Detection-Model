Although the video is real.. but the tornado isn&#39;t.<br><br>Original tornado was in texas <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XkMVwaKDgM">https://youtu.be/_XkMVwaKDgM</a>
this message was from google btw<br>In South Africa tornadoes are the recurring phenomenon (the climatology) but so far they have received less attention. Damages from storms itself (tornadoes inclusive) are significant in South Africa relative to other weather-related disasters for example floods, heat waves, and droughts.
You can get tornadoes in Cape Town,the reason you don&#39;t get them often is because of the types of wind that creates a tornado.<br>there are 3 types of air types that form a Tornadoes form when warm, humid air collides with cold, dry air.<br>the reason why you think that is because it is rare for them to occur.<br>the video might seem fake,but it doesn&#39;t mean tornadoes don&#39;t appear here<br>and to anwser AstonWinter,it may be real
