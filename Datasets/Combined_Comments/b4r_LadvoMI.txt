Anisha Jain&#39;s voice is so good
I feel like they are overacting 😂
To be honest Parineeti needs a new stylist man...
These people are so ignorant....who styled people before them
Styling has now become a profession in the last ten years but in early two thousands it was not even known.
It&#39;s Anaita Shroff who gave a new face to the profession
Are how to be a celeb stylist?

I am sorry but it&#39;s not Rhea nd sonam but Anaita shroff, who&#39;s the OG... May be in recent times Rhea has taken it to a different level...
Love these interviews!!! Keep them cominggg
You can love or hate Sonam and Rhea, but there’s no denying that Rhea is solely responsible for Bollywood upping their fashion game 💯
The stylist were more humble and sophisticated, while the actresses  who wore  their innovative  ideas were more fairly ill tempered and arrogant.
