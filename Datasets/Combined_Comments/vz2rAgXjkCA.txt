I have something to say, which i have been keeping for a very long period, in october 2022, somehow i got an indication of a death, the day was the 5th day of durga puja, that night one of my family members came to the house, and completed dinner sitting right to me, next day he made a road accident and got dead, when i reached the MORTUARY for post mortem procedure, a dead body of a member of IAF came to the place on an auto, but few minutes later 15-16 TOYOTA vehicle came to the place, i had two things in my mind, either toyota will be responsible for my dead body, or toyota will save me from any accident, hence thanks to the lord shiv and maa durga for my unemployment, other wise on 24,10,2022 (DIWALI) my dead body could have reached the NORTH BENGAL MEDICAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL for post mortem, today 27.2.2024, and i am still unemployed, and i do not have any orders to buy any TOYOTA VEHICLE in future for driving, hence almighty has decided to make me sit in innova of NHAI, and after innova or land cruiser as the most POWER FULL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL OF INDIA, still i got order to buy LAND ROVER DISCOVERY SPORT, VOLVO XC 90, AUDI Q3, followed by BMW XM, G 63, for driving, orders may vary may not be vary, thank for reading my comment,❤,
Und so macht man gute Werbung ❤❤❤

Now do it again with some cars that aren&#39;t ugly. Granted they&#39;re still better looking than the new M2, 3 and 4 series. Don&#39;t mess it up with the new M5, but we all know you will.
2 series is 9 years old??

Sooo... Bro Rizzed up a Police Officer 🤣🫡
@Bmw rock and roll ✌️
Corporate tyranny RULES the world, even Europe. BMW proves this and it is a CRIME that they are still in bidness. Talk about transference of wealth from owners to parts manufacturers and BMW dealer service departments. It is ALL SO OBVIOUS, but American owners, like ALL BMW owners, have ZERO representation in CONGRESS or in the average American courtroom, save for those who are in the top 1% wealthiest. So as the buyer, you are supposed to KNOW that buying a BMW INCLUDES several thousands more for constant repairs. So buyer beware, because BMW has absolutely NO LEGAL DUTY to make ANYTHING of good quality and reliability. This is because wherever you are in this f-d up world, WHOMEVER HAS THE MOST MONEY rules the courts and owns the judges. That is NOT YOU. That is OLIVER ZIPSHITZ, the current BMW CEO. How evil and morally bankrupt must you be to get THAT job?

How do I contact bmw headquarters in Germany? I am from UK and own a bmw. I have contacted BMW UK a number of times. They are not responding back or helping me at all. Someone advise?

A BMW that doesn&#39;t drift is a pointless object!

I’m still confused how society has convinced us that everyone should drive with the same speed on roads. Obviously some can drive better than others. I can’t but still...
wowww
My all time favourite video
My BMW is an e46 ///M 2
The only company that goes as far to not even warn the customers to drift like that. DOPE
In 2023?<br>I wouldn&#39;t surprice if they are in the Fast and Furious
Rip tyres

You can actually see the power of the engine.

Unfortunately it doesn’t look so clever when their buyers try to imitate the bad boy/street race/drift image that BMW has been subliminally pushing for the 3 and 4 series for a while
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👌👌👌👌👌👌👌simple superb extraordinary. Excellent communication well balanced drifting. Hatsoff to all the one who drove the car Mindblowing. Great job guys 👋👋👋👋👋👋
All is great, but now is again tike to come up next generation of front design.

Hi BMW! I really need help. My dealer in Russia stole my darkened mirror. And he doesn&#39;t want to give it back to me. The service gave me the usual one. Support for BMW Russia does not want to solve this issue. Please find out the truth. I can send you the vehicle&#39;s VIN code to check the configuration.
So very skilful
GOOD 👍👍
The only thing more beautiful than those cars is the city it was filmed in...... 10/10 CAPE TOWN

BMW car quality surprisingly sucks !<br>The BMW dealer (stevens creek) is selling you defective car with brand new price !!!<br><br><br>I purchased a brand new 2020 X7 from this dealer.<br>And the car was broken after 7 days driving:<br>1. The touch screen is 100% off, I can not control anything on the display.<br>2. The bluetooth wipe out my and my wife&#39;s phone (Andriod and Iphone both) connection 3 time a week, which mean we need to reconnect/reconfigure our phone connection every other day.<br>3. The battery is dead permanently, the error signal was on when I purchased it originally, but the sales told me it will be back to normal after couple days driving. But after 1 week driving, the battery error signal is still there, and need to be replaced.<br>4. The rubber seal on the frontend hook is coming out, and looks really ugly and do not match the BMW brand at all.<br>5. The auto lock is not function at all. After enabling this feature, the auto lock still not working at all. This feature is very normal one on any premium brand car back to 5+ year ago.  I personally own another Acura and Tesla, all of cars have this function and there is no problems to use such function in the past 3 years.<br>6. All of the cellphone app remote control function is not working on my car. I can not lock/unlock/flash/horn the car via the phone app.<br><br>I drop off the car 5 calendar days (4 business) ago.<br>And service department is still working on it, from the time it took, I can definitely tell this is not a small issue. Since the service adviser told me, replacing a new battery will only cost them half business day.<br>So for sure, there is a huge defective on this brand new X7 car.<br><br>I am really surprised that this dealer will sell defective car to the customer, especially on such high end/premium 7 series product line.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Update @2020-06-24:<br>After 5 days waiting, today afternoon the service department just called me back, saying the display is totally off, and can not be fixed by them. So they decided to order a new display from BMW, and the new part will arrive on Friday(so another 3 business days waiting). And then they will need to replace the display part completely!<br>Can you imagine this is what happened to a brand NEW X7, with 7 days driving and only less than 200 mileage.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>update @2020-07-16<br>After 3 weeks of review, the BMW North America customer relationship department called me and said they made a decision and will do nothing regarding my defective X7. <br>I feel speechless and helpless. BMW is acting like a robber, who steals your $, with a defective product, and does nothing about the complaint. I do not see how BMW is caring about its customer. <br>Really disappointment, and I will seek to sue BMW North America.

My story ? Had a e92 335i bi turbo from  40k miles on the clock for 6 years. First common fault water pump next common issue fuel pump, injectors, turbos, electronic sensors like oxygen, vanos, abs and many more. Oil leaks from everywhere. Whole Suspension has to be replaced before 100k miles. Non stop cracked 19” alloys. Oil consumption after oil leaks fixed 1L every 800 miles. Finally engine died at 120k miles, coz of water pump fault again.
Super mais en ville ont dépassé rarement les 30 km/h.
Acting like Turkish Stars 🛫🛫🛫🛫👏👏👏👏
Why you no leave the Cape Town license plates on the cars ? 😭
No! Taka reklama daje do myślenia!
My bmx can drift too and doesn&#39;t have oil leaks😉 so I prefer my bmx xd

This is how Marketing has to look like
Imagine being late to work and then they put up a roadblock to make you even later just so they can show drifting bmw’s.
I love bmw
This is how you do it top gear.
Send this to Nissan)
BMW
Me: I need a car that I can drift. Got some, Audi?<br><br><br><br>Audi: No, but you can go to the BMW dealership next store.
Wow looks good but nowhere near the face lifted version
Just shredded a wheel on my bmw 5 series while drifting and now this is in my recommendation... youtube knows everything
My bmw story? Ticket 🤣
Fake
It&#39;s actually called an m2
This looks like the intro for Need for speed most wanted 2012 before you race a most wanted player.
Too much fake stunts
Bmw Forever!!♥️♥️♥️😎😎💪🏻💪🏻

So is my bmw still covered by warranty if I drive like that? If not, don&#39;t promote it and give me ideas 😄
Hey BMW I want to buy a new 235 to do this.<br>BMW: I&#39;m so sorry you never could do this anymore at because our 2 series become front wheel Drive we suggest you to buy a second-hand BMW and or get the 3 or 4 series but they are more heavily and more expensive and a softer suspension make you feel more luxurious.<br>..............That is not I want
Look BMW,<br><br>This is what COOL realy looks like;<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVqeOvuvS4">https://youtu.be/wNVqeOvuvS4</a><br><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-NU9TiD3OA">https://youtu.be/E-NU9TiD3OA</a>

Not even using their turn signals.
In BMW store: “Im looking for a new car, have some?”<br><br>Salesman: “yep, here you have red ones totally new”
Boss: Why are you late?<br>Me: Some BMWs were drifting at the roundabout
Greta dont like this xd
Монтаж же. За 2 минуты ниодна не сломалась.
Only BMW would do this
I&#39;ve seen this many times...<br><br><br><br><br>In my city...<br><br><br><br><br><br>Bmw e46...<br><br><br><br><br>At 3am.
Bmw: posts impressive drift videos of their rear wheel drive cars<br><br>ALSO BMW: lets make a 2 liter front wheel drive car and call it the new 135 i<br><br>I like what i see but not what I am going to see with the next 2 series😢
Car manufacturer: we created the best system so our cars can be stable <br>BMW: Hold my bear
Factory drift train haha whoop whoop Beemer ftw 😂🤙🔥
Smh This is so fake... <br><br><br><br><br>The roundabout is a paid actor.
this trash will crumble after 5 minutes of such exploitation
Неочем. Хуета.

100% percent adv, few camera angles are trick shoot and especially the drone shoot is 1.5x speed editing. Most of the shoot is cut and play then edited as if single shot video. However I like the video.
Oh god... perfect drit...❤️

FUCK&#39;IN AHEM.... SPEECHLESS!
Wow 💪👍
<b>pretty much how the average BMW driver drives anyways, except not in a safe condition and no skills</b><br>Audi drivers these days trying to copy the aggressive and egoistic attitudes (or aka asshole attitudes), I would say they are catching up to top dick drivers rankings right next to BMW pretty quickly. They are still missing the reflective sun glasses though.

For those asking who actually buys a BMW, and drifts with it... I do. As my weekender (fun car), I have drifted complete turns, and intersections on the road in California... I like the adrenaline rush I get ;) . Do not try it if you don&#39;t know what you are doing. You can cause a serious accident if you mess up. Practice on an open parking lot secluded from populated areas, or at a race track. I drive a tastefully modded E36, and have taken it over 155MPH in a matter of seconds, while the inline 6 cylinder engine roars!. This car has a lot of character, considering the style of contours, and the racing history this model has, to the engineering that went in to it. The E36 saloon, or coupe corners like a pro, and has a 50/50 front to back weight ratio. The chassis was tested on a highly advanced machine that simulated the Nurburgring race track from Germany, to configure a well balanced suspension that provides that ultimate driving experience. This BMW gets complements everywhere I go with it, and it deserves to be well taken care of for sure. If you want to play with BMW&#39;s always buy genuine parts, or better ones. If not you will learn the hard way. Like any nice car, its more expensive to maintain than to own... specially after the warranty period.

ciekawe ktorego prowadzi Frog :P
The year is 2025 and BMW only makes front wheel drive crossovers :/<br><br>lol jk but my worst fear is not being able to buy something rear wheel drive that can drift and has a manual transmission when I (hopefully) get a well paying job myself<br>It seems like most car companies are switching over to big sedans or crossovers and ditching manuals
My story is that my X5 has a frikin automatic and can&#39;t do shit about it :(
Luke Huxam is a mastermind when it comes to shooting car videos. Awesome as always, and thanks to BMW for making it happen!

Damn I wish they could do a real one, some parts were real but most of it were editing.
I wish we can do like this in Japan
That was one of the worst videos I&#39;ve ever seen....I think I felt sick watching it.  Cheese anyone?
how many bmws did you go through
Relax, men. Our Russian cars can drift more good)

Awesome choreography drift these lads at BMW did.
Petite question : elle coûte combien ?
Some the clips look suspect. Kinda resembles CGI, but it could well be sped up a little.. Too hard to tell
Lets see Audi-boys do that!

It&#39;s not fake TheZakon I was there on set... it took them hours to get it together! with a lot of almost boring cuts and retakes!
Awesome
I&#39;d like to say I drive just as well, but alas, I cannot.  But I still can get around corners quickly!
Най добрите сте

It&#39;s not fake, just sped up a little.
my BMW story is at most in 1/72 :S
Splendid...
E.P.I.C
Super :)
So much irony.. USA police close off the circle, eurpean license plates on the cars, video recorded 20meters from my work IN SOUTH AFRICA.
Odlično..
God, thank you that you have created Germany which in turn created a BMW &lt;3
I want this car.. :)
Totally fake lol, but it looks nice! 
hahaha nice
This is epic and even cooler that it&#39;s in Cape Town!!
It looks almost fake because of the amount of times the scene was cut and shot a different angle. I want to see a raw video where it isn&#39;t cut every five seconds, or at least show the scene when they drift and once they&#39;re done drifting play it back again in a different angle. But whatever that was must of been amazing to watch in person.
Ого-го, очень круто!
Nem rossz de azért ne pisiljünk be;)
The future of BMW is more brighter than yesterday. Salute
This is BMWs idea of RESPONSIBILITY?! No wonder it has not had the responsibility to recall cars affected by  timing chain faults. Thousands and thousands of claims against this puffed up company. BMW is living ON  a hard earned reputation but not UP to it, according to people who know much better than me

Обожаю автомобили марки BMW!Видео действительно поразило,а особенно профессионалы за рулем,но как мне кажется без особого монтажа и удачных ракурсов для съемки было бы не настолько эффектно.
who was the cameraman?
Dammmmmn!!!!
If I only had the money...
This one time, I was doing doughnuts round a round about, and this cop came, and I asked her to get in, and she arrested me instead.
I have officially started saving!!
