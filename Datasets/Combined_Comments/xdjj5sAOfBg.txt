Just a quick warning!!!! Boiling water with electricity won&#39;t work well without an electrolyte. So some people might add salt in order to make the water more conducive, but boiling saltwater with electricity is how you make bleach!

Razor blades plus AC sounds like a great idea, especially when you see the colour of the water. Not to mention the massive electrocution risk, assuming they don’t trip the breaker.

If you can’t pour a drink properly then you’re obviously too young to be Pouring it
I read once that some kids bleached stawberry to turn it white (because they saw it in a 5 Minutes Craft video) and then ate it and got sick.
the. bowl of human suffering is actually quite cool. it was atleast for me artistically very effective at conveying how much we take things for granted.
The romba one is cool ngl
You know I actually found a 5 minute craft that worked it was basically add foil to a pencil eraser and you use it as stylus and I tried it and it worked so if anyone needs a stylus here you go

(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdjj5sAOfBg&amp;t=347">05:47</a>) &quot;I thought DIY would be about questioning why you create something buts its making me question why I was created&quot;<br>Deep

You know, you can use a spoon the correct way or you can use it backwards. If you use the spoon backwards, you will notice that your cereals are falling, so just grab a hammer and smash the spoon with the hammer so your cereals don’t fall!

You should think about having kids PeWds. I understand it can be fun to shit on them and be dismissive of things considered childish, but having kids really makes everything in life fun again. Instead of patronizing childish ideas you rediscover how amazing it is to recognize innocence.

I know this because I was looking for a custom made plush to look like my cat, and I found a person who made these kind of things. I actually found the exact person who made that fix plush (I can&#39;t remember the name).<br>The point is was that fox plush was handmade. Some one put in hours of hard work into that plush and 5 minute crafts just absolutely destroyed it.

Last January, me and my group mates made that brush thing at the start of the video for our SIP(Science Investigatory Project). During the actual report when we were trying to demonstrate the actual product. My classmate accidentally pushed it out of the armchair and it broke, the motor and battery were just scattered there on the ground and since it broke we cant get the grade cause the teacher don&#39;t know if it actually works. I mean, I already know that our product is shit and stupid for believing something that works on the internet most of the times. But to my surprise, we got actually got 98/100 on our SIP. Anyways thanks for reading.

There&#39;s a channel called How To Cook That who debunks fake life hack channels like 5 Minute Crafts. I recommend watching her videos because you&#39;ll learn good stuff from her. 😊
A few years ago I tried a five minutes craft &quot;craft&quot; and I got a permanent scar on my finger YAY

the ramen noodle thing is 1005 fake. just fyi. for anyone dumb enough and willing to fuck up their porcelain to try it.
x minute krofts are just scams, but the amount of views that it gets (along with its surrogate channels) it shows that people want scams, need scams to happen to them. They lost their ability to be creative and need stupid things to see ;-)<br>I get that 5% are good things but why would you even continue looking after you see what&#39;s all about? Eh. Idiocracy is near, so, we&#39;ll wait, right?... bruh...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdjj5sAOfBg&amp;t=784">13:04</a> Is this what Marzia tried to recreate but created an entity that haunts edgar?

The razor kettle is a real thing, they used to make those in prison when they needed hot water to cook in their cells, they used to call &#39;em &#39;stingers&#39;, watch Larry Lawton for an extended instruction on how to make one safely because it can blow a fuse in your home if used incorrectly :D
