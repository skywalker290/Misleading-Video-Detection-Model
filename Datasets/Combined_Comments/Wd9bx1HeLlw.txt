Story of veer ahirs
it was a good series but personal life  ko zada importance dia gaya
114 ahiro ne apna balidaan diya
after wtching this series i feel it has been big direspect to our soldiers rather than showing bravery he showed personal life
Ahir regiment ❤
Battle of Rezang la….. post this battle Chinese nvr came back to claim this land ever in spite of having soldiers superiority. That was the valour shown by ahir caste from Rewari Haryana that Chinese nvr moved ahead fearing onslaught ahead wherein one company killed 3000 Chinese soldiers.
अहीर🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Yrrr kya series baniye hai ashgi jada dekhi gayi kuch ta toofani banate boring series of the year
这些虚假的宣传电影真的很离谱。<br>当时中国刚经历过大饥荒，中国士兵们又横穿青藏高原和印度人打仗。难以置信的是极少的饥饿的虚弱的中国士兵竟然像赶鸭子一样打败了大批印度军队，并且保有和平之心释放俘虏，也没有侵略印度领土。<br>我对这场战争的评价是印度军队把侵略战争打成了保卫战争，贪婪又无能。<br>我对这种电影的评价是印度政府用臆想的勇武来遮掩自己的不堪。<br>我的建议是政府应该对穷人提供更多的保障，而不是用精神的安慰剂来替代。
India should not carry on British legacy.
Ahir regiment hak hai hamara

18 Nov 1962 में रेजांग्ला चुशूल में 13 कुमाऊं रेजिमेंट के 124 सैनिक तैनात थे इस रेजिमेंट को वीर अहीर भी कहा जाता है क्यूंकि इसमें सैनिक यादव होते है। 124 भारतीय सैनिकों ने 2000 चीनी सैनिकों को धूल चटा दी थी ये बहुत वीरता से लड़े थे और दुश्मनो आगे बढ़ने नहीं दिया था।<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%A6">#जयहिंद</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4_%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE_%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%80_%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%AF">#भारत_माता_की_जय</a>

Without Jaswant singh and a brave girl from Arunachal Pradesh there is no story of Indo-chinese war 1962... Please make a special movie on them..  Then Arunachal Pradesh was known as NEFA.. Most of army officers were out of post to  avoid death but Rifleman Jaswant singh didn&#39;t do that, he fought and fought for three days alone along with his loved Sela the brave daughter of India..
Who is here after watching Pawndeep rajan short video ❤️❤️
This web series should be in theatre

The battle of Rezang la is one of the bravest battle in the history of indian army <br><br>where 120 ill equiped  solders of Charlie company of kumaun Regiment who were told to retreat from their post due to heavy influx of better equipped Chinese solders but they refused to retreat and fought till the last bullet last men<br><br>And braving such odds  killed nearly 1500 better equipped solders of Chinese army who not only were better equipped but had the support of artillery (which killed most of our solders)<br><br>It was due to this heavy loss the chinese declared ceasefire otherwise they had significant gains in NEFA<br><br>The solders fought with such bravery that even the superior officers were not believing it and it was when they shaw the battlefield after the winters that they could see the evidence of bravery themselves<br><br>Bollywood should make a big budget movie on this battle so that comman  people of inda also know about the bravery<br><br>The Rezangla war memorial is on the bike trail of leh Ladakh but very few Indians know the bravery of our solders<br><br>Their bravery need to be told to the nation
Sorry to say .... Special effects are so poor ...

Where is Jaswant Singh Rawat?? In whole series??? The main hero ko 1962 who killed 300 Chinese soldiers at that own
Finally, some decided to show China real face.

It is very nice series. War scenes in the last are done well. Slow in the middle though. For soldier&#39;s family every incidence is different than common lives like us, that is well captured in the series. At one stage I felt who is going to live longer a Major or his wife with cancer. For him a war is at both ends. Every Indian should watch this series.
Nice

Excellent<br>But this series is defending Nehru a lot <br>That bastard is reason why we faced so many problems especially our soldiers
Don&#39;t know why the hell do they hide the real names of our brave warriors. The post in actual was of Rezang La and the officer in command was Param Vir Chakra awardee Major Shaitan Singh ..... Salute to our real heroes 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
This show Neheru in good light, but in reality it was his fault that India lost this big chunk of land.
If this movie was in 3D then it was so .....

Jai dada kishan
I read about this movie in Chinese social media bc it became a mockery there . Losing a war is one thing, losing so badly is another, let alone it was a massacre for Indian soldiers. And Indian ppl, OK bollywood, has audacity to claim winner. The war was so lopsided - 3 Chinese soldiers captured a whole Indian battalion without firing a shot. 😂 😂
Bhai jisne nhi dekhi use bhi yeh dekhni chahiye war + love story and india vs china war kuch ankahi kahani kuch hero&#39;s ki jo acting thi wo kamal ki thi movie ke andar mujhe sabse jyada acha wo teen soldiers jo any tk lde<br>Kishan, ramkumar, Karan<br>First time mujhe lga ki jo itna hasha skta hain wo itne serious roll bhi kr skta hain <br>Awesome I love this web series mene iske liye hi hotstar ka vip recharge krwaya mujhe to bahut achi lagi  ha kuch khamiya hain bt dushri web series se or abhi jo bollywood ki halat hain usse to yeh khi behtar hain
Indian live in their dreams😂
I am respect Bollywood Army 🤔😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣

Very good series must see for every Indian. We don&#39;t really have much idea about 1962 war. Thanks to our History test books we know so many things about world war, Alexander the fool and so many others...but so little about our real fighters. <br><br>Kudos to Pawandeep Rajan(Indian Idol 2021 contestant) 😀...chota sa role tha but bada acha laga dekhke.
Fast forward to 2020<br>China again tried to inflatrate Indian border ended up losing a strategic hilltop location and six border posts along LAC and accepted stalemate and casualties from their side after six months

Poor vfx but i watching
Jai rajputana, jai major saitan singh bhati
Wathar station is shown as Rewari Jn - director forgot to cover the station name :P
Watched amazing
Waiting  Watched ❤🇮🇳❤
This series depicts 1962  war in the worst possible way....the makers should take lessons from the creators of the movie 1971 which is available on YouTube. <br>This series is just like the movie paltan based on the 1967 nakula conflict the only similarity being both are really bad .<br>Disappointed
Who tf dislikes productions like these &amp; goes on to give thousands of likes to Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai &amp; Saath Nibhana Saathiya!
Who gets goosebumps while watching
Rejang La war, salute to veer Ahir , hope this movie would do justice to them not giving their name to others.

Sorry but the acting is very bad
Worst acting and cinematography in any webseries ever
Y chaina whi h na jiss n 1962 m Tibet aor ab 20 soldiers mary ao Indian zamin m betha h <br>Indian army only on Bollywood
Horrible direction and production.  The 1st episode itself shows the lack of quality in the series. The village is shown as Rewari and it clearly feels like a village in konkan. Mr. Manjrekar, you think the viewers are morons to not  understand that you have put a whole marathi cast to depict haryanvis. What a waste.
Yadav brothers should understand that by pointing yadav or ahirs they r cutting the size of their sacrifice ...each Soldier of rezang la is Son of India ...maati ka laal 🇮🇳 don&#39;t cut them itno Yadav&#39;s jaats rajput they r our best  soldiers
Hotstar make web series on rajiv Dixit
People fighting on Ahir yadav etc ...yakeen kro vo us din jo lad rhe the vo hind k liye lade hind k liye jaan di  vo hindustani the  border pr hindustani ki fauz ladti h  regiment koi bhi ho sainik se pucho usko samman chahiye desh se ...124 sainiko ko naman krta hu 🙏
Bkwass
Ahir Regement hak h hamara
Abhay Deol is going to have another blast as usual.I salute all the soldiers who were martyred🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

It&#39;s nice but a little over dramatic. Need more realism. Chinese speaking Hindi? They should&#39;ve subtitled that section. Looks like it&#39;ll fall to the prey of populism.

My grandfather was survived in this war..  He was a subedar on that time. Proud of him....... ♥♥♥♥♥♥
India was humiliated in this war. history knows everything. Don&#39;t lie lol director
Vande Matram... <br>Alas somebody dared to tell the truth about 1962 War...
Pappu chiness iska virodh karega pakka
Kesari movie was touted as the most patriotic fight but it had nothing to do with Indian army. Just a glorification of a particular religion. Got famous coz of the song and Akshay&#39;s Deshbhakti. But movies like 1971 &amp; 1962  go unnoticed. That&#39;s the artistic attack Bollywood does.  Ours fault too that we don&#39;t acknowledge the real contents. Glad I didn&#39;t watch that.   Ready to binge watch 1962. Hope it does represent the fact without changing their names. We all proud of the Rezang La, Shaitan Singh and the brave Ahirs of Kumaon Regiment. 🙏🏼 Jai Hind 🇮🇳
Paramvir Chakra Sri Major Shaitaan Singh and his men. The Bravehearts of Rezang La
How can mr.nehru afford a war with china by sending just 125 soldiers..125 vs 3000 this is ridiculous. India badly missed the services of netaji.
Akash thosar

China Mai BHI 🇮🇳 Lehrayega
bollywood Infiltrate history with their fake content..😡😡😡
We were brutaly beaten by chinese in 1962, we were not prepared as hindi chini bhai bhai nautanki by nehru, we used 1914 ww1 rifles bcoz menon said no need of army, we were not helped by russian despite of fact that nehru was russian agent by policy, we lost 38000 sq km. I think if instead of nehru if patel would have been there definitely result of war might be in favor of us.
I got goosebumps watching this 🔥❤️
Nehru and k k menon ki aisi taisi kr di China ne
Wow
Indian army ki jai ho, and isme jitne bhi actor h sab ki acting mst h or koi bhi over acting nhi krtaa h mst hogyi ye
Sometimes I feel.pakistan is just an conspiracy tool we think wants kashmir.real greed is china for kashmir
🇮🇳AHIR REGIMENT🇮🇳
One of the most underrated actor Abhay Deol ❤️
India won war all movies in our fantasy🤔
I hoped it would be near reality but felt like watching hype of war drama. Feeling bad. High pitch dialogues. Nothing feels real in it. Sorry if someone is hurt

Thanks hotstar. <br>You are doing a Samaritan&#39;s job by fuelling  nationalism in &#39;half baked&#39; Indian audiences. <br>Atleast we&#39; ll acknowledge- what true bravery is! <br>I am totally fed up with &#39;masala 🍿movies&#39; of bollywood.

Abhay Deol&#39;s character is based on Major Shaitan Singh Bhati of Kumaon Regiment

Major Shaitan Singh indeed became the devil who&#39;d haunt the Chinese soldiers on the battlefield, but in the end he was escorted to heaven by angels.
So you are telling me, Dev and Paro are reuniting in this ?!
India alwas win only movies not real life😃😃😃
VFX could have been better.
Abhay Deol underrated actor, I&#39;m glad he is getting quality content movies.

I wonder how Akshay kumar is not a part in this movie. This was history when India fought against China. Now, China has already conquered our places and all this government cares about is handing over all the money to his friends and about the upcoming bengal elections.
अति उत्तम।<br>बहुत जरूरत थी इस सच्ची विरगाथा पर फिल्म बनने की।

I hope they show nehru’s failure and coward leadership as PM that time which lead India to a disgraceful defeat....!!!
you shitty Bollywood people still playing with our feelings you people totally change his name....the bravest solider of the battle of Razangla was MAJ.

₹399 deke bhi ads dekhna padhta hai bc 🤷🏻‍♂️
This actor shouldn&#39;t  be there, manoj bajpai etc are better
Ab to AHIR Regement leke rahenge 🙏
I am a big war movie fan and there has been a dearth of good war movies or shows based on our rich Indian history. Nice that the OTT platforms are coming forward and investing and giving us shows like this and The Forgotten Army which came out last year. This definitely looks interesting and I am so looking forward to watching it. The sound track also seems to sound quite good. Only complaint would be that at times the CGI effects looks a bit odd.
Thanks a ton to our army who saved our Maa Bharati
1962 मैं हमारी क़िस्मत कितनी ख़राब थी<br>ये भाढ़वा ये गाँडू ही हमारा pm था

Finally! I&#39;m seeing Abhay Deol in a movie after a long time. He really needs to do more and more. All that talent is wasting and we aren&#39;t watching his awesome acting. Instead we all have to bear Varun Dhawan, Ranveer Singh kinda actors.
120 ahir vs 6000 Chinese soldiers
Based on indo sino war
Please rate this kind of movies 5 out of 5 they r outsiders not stupid nepo kids good for nothing.

I thinks trailer looks ordinary like other shows initially but the title track, it&#39;s the fourth moon of the show. I loved it. Looking forward and best wishes for one my favourite all time Abhay Deol. ❤️
इस युद्ध को भी भारत आराम से जीत सकता था लेकिन जवाहरलाल नेहरू ने अपनी राजनीति के चक्कर में देश को झोंक दिया और देश की वायु सेना को इसमें हिस्सा नहीं लेने दिया था और अपने शासनकाल में तिब्बत और पीओके कि 148000 वर्ग किलोमीटर जमीन को हार गए.
Rejangla Ahir warriors
Loving the casts ❤️
yadav
India lost to China in 1962 but fight at 3 locations should be considered victory for India.<br>Subedar Joginder Singh (20 vs 600)<br>Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat (1 vs 300)<br>Major Shaitan Singh (125 vs 3000)
D day game graphics are much better than this dirty film
casting is bad
Too much animated explosions. No offense but the vfx looks kind of cheaper quality. Would have loved it more had they used good vfx or live action demo explosions.
Wow
Parshya😍😍
Abhay Deol saying &#39;Ladakh haath se gaya toh wapas nahi aayega&#39; sounds like dolly shopping gayi toh wapas nahi aayegi

Battle Of Rejangla.....When 125 Indian Lions Fought Against 3000+ Chinese Wolves.
Awesome trailer ❤️❤️❤️
Jawaharlal nehru: We cannot afford a war with china...<br><br>Fact: Both India and china were at the same place in terms of economy in 1962. And militarily, India, was a bit better than china cuz we had Air force. It was Nehru&#39;s weak policy that made us lose 1962 war.<br><br>Today, when china&#39;s military is really powerful and economically, china is so much strong (that it defeated 2 countries (Australia and US) in trade war and also successfully survived economic sanctions from India and UK), then also, we defeated them in Galwan (2021) and Doklam (2017). Thus a powerful military is not the only thing we want. We also want a powerful leader, who can control a powerful military.<br><br>Salute to our brave heroes amd martyrs.<br><br>P.S.: Please make a series on 1971 war too... I would like to see that how world&#39;s largest ever surrender took place.
My maternal grandfather faught this war &amp; survived it. The only <b>Line that holded</b> itself was the <b>Chushul sector</b> of <b>Rezang La</b> where <b>123 AHIRS from plains of 13th Kumaon</b> took the last stand &amp; faught the last man last round battle, which is greatest battle faught till now in the history of Indian Army. To this day <b>Yadavas</b> do not have their Regiment in the Army despite having a <b>Valiant history</b> .... This  is no more than a 2nd class movie...nothing here has any significance in reality. Read the Diary Entry of <b>General KS Thimmaiya</b> if you want to learn the real thing.

इसमें उस अहीरवाल की मिट्टी का भी जिक्र किया जाना चाहिए था जहां से वो 125 वीर आते थे । बहुत से लोगों को यह जान कर अचंभा होगा के वो सभी वीर एक ही इलाके से थे और एक ही जाति के थे । कुछ तो सगे भाई थे । थोडी अहीरवाटी भाषा भी डालनी चाहिए थी जिससे नाट्य रूपांतरण में सच्चाई आती । वो डायलॉग भी डालना चाहिए था जिसमें एक जवान कह रहा है के &quot; हम खेत की मेड़ आसानी से नहीं छोड़ते ये तो देश की सीमा है &quot; । मुझे लगता है केवल रूपांतरण कर देते और एक्स्ट्रा कुछ नहीं डालते तब और भी बेहतर होता । <br>अहीर रेजिमेंट हक है 🚩

my grandfather fought in this war...and he told me it was the fault of the government as they failed to provide ammo... as for the guns they were not made to work in extreme cold so they jammed all the time..
Some sick mentality persons not saying Them Indian they are saying Aahir<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yadav">#yadav</a> ..<br>😂😂😂😂  <br>Persons like you i see i just think that and just my hart says Chadarmod..<br>Salute to all Indian Army personnel they sacrifice their live in the Name of Bhart mata ..<br>Not for the sake of Ahirs .<br>Grow your minds Ahir devtas
Uri <br>Ka<br>Takkar ki movie👌👌👌😊
इस मूवी का नाम AHEER WARRIORS 1962 होना चाहिए।
Flop
This movie title name AHEER WARRIORS 1962
Abhay deol.. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
जय यादव जय माधव<br>जय मुरलीधर
इस मूवी को नाम 125 वीर अहीर योद्धा होना चाहिए था।
सलाम उन 125 वीर अहीर योद्धा सपूतों  को जो अपने देश के लिए जान कुर्बान कर दिए
abhay u beauty
125 वीर अहीर योद्धा पर कहानी जो पूरी दुनिया में महानतम युद्ध में से एक है । 125 वीर अहीर सपूतों ने 3000 से जायदा चीनी सैनिकों को मर गिराया था।
Editing graphics will be better ❤️

Btao Ye Trailer Trending pr nhe gyi. Jb ki Us Tatti Kakkr ki Video jati hai Trending pr.😡😡
Dev and Paro
Noone can beat Abhay Deol he is on top 👍Good Luck Bhai!!!!!!!!
In real India lost their territory  but  in movies  it will  be totally opposite .   Lol. Hahah
It&#39;s nice to see a good actor like Abhay Deol is portraying Major Shaitan Singh Bhatti, PVC and awaiting for this series. I am sensing a error here. In this trailer our soldiers are firing through Kalashnikov, Heavy Machine Guns and Automatics but in reality our forces had old vintage .303 and Bren guns thanks to the ignorant defense modernization policy of our esteemed first Prime Minister and ex-communist Defense Minister who likes his pliant generals and clashes with worthy generals like Thinayya, Thorat and Manekshaw.<br>Battle of Rezangla is the gloriest chapter in our war history. Whenever I read or here anything about this Battle, I always feels goosebumps; my eyes start tearing for our bravest 125 fighters of 13th Kumaon. I hope bollywood didn&#39;t messed with history this time.<br>&quot;How a man can dies better against fearful odds, for ashes of his father and temples of his god.&quot;
Not against the sentiments. <br>Just a little disappointed at the production.<br>But Ak-47 in 1962 ? <br>Our Soldiers had only 303 Enfield Rifles at that time. Only officers used carbines. <br><br>Had that indian battalion had Automatic Guns to use, they would had wiped out the entire Chinese regiment.
जय हिंद!<br>भारत माता की जय!

I am Chinese and I love India movies. <br>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think this is a good movie even though I haven&#39;t watched it completely yet.<br><br>Of course, don&#39;t be so quick to blame me.<br><br>I never mean this blacken China or something.<br>What I want to say is just that IT OVERSTATES PLA.<br><br>In 1962, China was a very poor and underdeveloped country and there are lots of people who can&#39;t get enough food.<br>And you know, Chinese belongs to the yellow race while Indian belongs to the Caucasian race. Everyone knows Caucasian is stronger than yellow in build.<br>Thirdly, PLA mainly consists of peasant and other poor people and its officer is the same.<br><br>Do you admit the three points above?<br>So how can you explain that the Chinese soldiers are so muscular that they almost explode their uniform in the movie?<br>And how can you explain that the Chinese commander behaves like a rich man, wearing sunglasses and clasping hands behind his back?<br>In 1962, if you behaved like a rich man, you will have been arrested and your property will be confiscated in China. <br><br>Finally, that&#39;s very funny that I found the director regard Chinese soldier as USA soldier.<br>Remember, Chinese soldiers too poor to be muscular like that, they never salute like a western soldier and play handsome(wearing sunglasses) in 1962.<br>Only USA soldier do this.<br><br>That&#39;s all I can&#39;t suffer as a normal Chinese. Some people always ignore the poverty of China.
Chalo jee jahan kahin yeh indian kisi se mar khatey hain to foran movie bana de te hain ... apni haar maar bezati chupane k liye ture event naam de k movies mai jeet k khush ho jatey hain chutiya hain aik number k
Although we are proud of our indian soldiers but meiyang chang is also an indian and his acting is great in this

Abhay Deol is underrated.. for me he&#39;s better actor than Sunny &amp; Bobby.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-bkgRF8FBg">https://youtu.be/y-bkgRF8FBg</a>
Love u Yadav Brothers!
Ohhh bhaii maza aa gya...i saw special cops that was outstanding nd now this...salute u guys
Bakwaas
Good to see Abhay Deol again love his acting 😊
Jai ho veero ki
nehru ji already knew about Chinese intention. Chinese President already mentioned around 6 months in advance in India visit. he gave 2 options to nehru ji, settle ladakh with Arunachal Pradesh or War.<br>nehru ji wanted to settle ladakh against Arunachal Pradesh, but His cabinet and others rejected the proposal.<br>in that case, nehru ji knew about Chinese mindset, but didn&#39;t take any proactive remedy or action.<br><br>From the beginning, Congress is a dove in front of Chinese Communist Party
wow....
Lots of luck to the series,<br>it&#39;s very hurting to serve for people who thinks sacrificing is a part of job,no it&#39;s not .<br>Salute to all those who are working for country&#39; pride and protection.
&quot;jai hind&quot;....
Zabardast
Will definitely watch it for Abhay Deol.
Wow...Awesome trailer it is...Salute to Indian army...Jay Hind...Jay Bharat...Bharat mata ki jay...❤️🙏❤️
My grandfather was in army in 1962 he have told me so many stories about war and how his friends died
Iiiiiiiiii want to say ye soldiers me hi kyu itni desh bhakti hoti hai !!! Hum amm admi siviliors me kyu nai hotuiii bne ch od bhaiiiii bharat mata ki jai bolne me sabki gand phat jati haiiiiii lodo ki madat chod<br>Bharat mata ki jaiiiiiii🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
125 Indian soldiers ok!!<br>But who counted that there were 3000 Chinese soldiers?? They all look same, i think double, triple counting mistake!
I hope the producers behind this don&#39;t make some propoganda movie or show after making 💰 from this show on our brave Indian soldiers.
In 125 soldiers there were 114 yadavs . Ahirs are from ahirwal haryana . Finally ..🙏🙏

Apart from bravery of our soldiers, failure of Jawaharlal Nehru&#39;s govt should also been showed, which resulted in China illegally occupying laddakh. Our soldiers fought bravely and were ready to take on China.

My Dad s cousin never came back in this battle... They never found his body.. Some says He was kidnapped by Chinese, and they never released him or killed him. Many soldiers have untold stories.
Imagine shubash chandra bose instead of pandit Ji because gandhi and playboy never wanted an army <br><br>If shubhash bose was there india would be a super power now<br><br>Father of the nation : netaji bose
There was much more than just shit and. Cry of nehru gandhis....<br><br>Dont wash their sins with soldiers blood.<br><br>It was complete idiotic behaviour from a govt. To its soldiers...from weapons to war policies.
Amazing

रेजांगला 1962 युद्ध मे 114 अहीरों ने शहादत दी है लेकिन सुना है कि इस वेबसिरिज मे वीर अहीरों के बलिदान का कहि जिक्र नही है ,<br>अगर ऐसा है तो ये भी मर्द कौम अहीर के लिए छलावा ही होगा

अब तक 8 विध्वंस ऐतिहासिक युद्धों में से 1 रहे रेजांगला युद्ध जो 18 नवम्बर 1962 को भारत चीन के बीच लड़ा गया , जिसमे 114 वीर अहीरों (यादव)  ने अपना सर्वस्व बलिदान दे कर देश का लद्दाख क्षेत्र सुरक्षित करते हुए 1300 से ज्यादा चीनी सैनिकों को मौत के घाट उतारा।<br><br>Last Bullet, Last Men 🎯

jay hind
but this feels more like a propaganda series than a historical war drama series because we lost pretty badly as much as i remember in 1962 and the chinese unilaterally declared ceasefire after conquering aksai chin ,   pls correct me if i am missing something here!!!
Surely it will Glorify Chacha

All Commandos are Ahir(Yadav).
Best movie trailer
Best of the best sereas is &quot;The forgotten army&quot;
On that time those bc congress was the reason we lost so much land to pak and china. Mc ne bas khaya. 5th Richest country but still developing.
In comment section why everyone is typing Ahir soldiers<br>Why not make it simple- 125 indian soldiers
बहुत शानदारवेब सीरीज तैयार की गई है अगर मेजर शैतान सिंह एवं उनके 120 वीर अहीर साथी का ओरिजिनल नाम शामिल कर दिया जाता तो क्या यह अधिकतर यादवो के साथ ही क्यों होता है
A request to all my yadav brothers to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycott1962">#boycott1962</a> <br>Pahle sarkar ne hamse hamara hakk Cheena ab ye sale do kodi ke producer<br>Script me veer Ahir likhne me shram aa rhi thi.?
