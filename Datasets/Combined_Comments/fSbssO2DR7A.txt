FAKE
go to &quot;making of one wing landing&quot;
I think it&#39;s not a fake also anything is possibleðŸ˜‰
Who even cares if it&#39;s fake? Â This is honestly one of the funniest videos I&#39;ve seen in a long time. the &quot;oh my God&quot; &quot;RUUUUN!!!!!&quot; XD Â  or &quot;NOOOOOO!!!!&quot; Even though this is a fake landing its comic genius!
It&#39;s even STUPID Fake. As if the wing somehow provides a lift, as long as it is there, like a fucking hot balloon. If you lose one wing like that you just can&#39;t control the plane anymore.
Well you can do it but that particular video is a fake you can find making of it on youtube
where is his fake wing? he just lost his fake wing! FAAAAKE! OH! AMAZFAKE...FAKE!
It&#39;s not fake, come on guys, plenty of radio controlled planes can/has done that, go google!
FAAAAKKE
wtf ?
GTA V! ahahahha
INCREDIBLE
fake -.-
FAKE FAKE Â FAKE
smashing...what an amazing pilot!!! This is so incredible
FAKE
really?.....

E eu ainda perdi meu tempo vendo isso u.u fake!
LOL, the airplane is clearly fake by the end of the video, it looks like something taken from a video game.
Em determinado momento creio que seja um protÃ³tipo de aeromodelismo.
VocÃªs sÃ£o tudo idiotas porque uma coisa dessas pode acontecer cambada d burros. kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk...

watch this to confirm how it done /watch?v=naSZBdJoEbM
You do know it&#39;s real? The propeller of a stunt plane is very strong therefore he used the plane like a helicopter and landed it.
1. Plane wings have been known to break off like that, so the argument is outright false
2. I have seen worse camera work that this. If the camera man loses the object of observation - autofocus will look for something to focus on. That seems to be consistent, if poor
3. You know jack about aviation it seems. This is very light sport plane designed for performing stunts that would never work on a Boeing. Technically the landing is not impossible.
4. Light plane
I agree about the metric, though.
fake
ITS FAKE BECAUSE:
1. A PLANE WING WOULDN&#39;T BREAK OFF LIKE THAT IN ANY CONDITIONS.
2. THE CAMERA WORK AND QUALITY IS S***, THE CAMERA ALSO KEEPS ON LOSING FOCUS FOR NO REASON.
3. I KNOW AVIATION AND A PLANE WITH ONE WING WOULD JUST SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL.
4. THE PLANES WHEEL SUPPORTS WOULD SNAP I THE PLANE WAS GENERATING NO LIFT AS IT DROPS FROM AT LEAST 1 &amp;1/2 METERS.

ALSO I THINK AMERICANS SHOULD GO METRIC.
@ACfireandiceDC Impossible with an F15? No. Grab a video of a plane more like the one here, then talk to me.  ;)
FAKE!
please don&#39;t believe this shit. it&#39;s fake!
look so real !!!
Just saw a clip of this on tv and decided to look it up
Ridiculous
that was beliveable until it landed  tht quick nd the prop stopped in 2 seconds. plus that turn shoulda made him  lean at least. also avery clean cut on that &quot;broken&quot; wing
Very Very Very  professional  pilot
congratulation 
Even the acting is bad.
@lithium803 u think?
search Making-Of the Killa Thrill &#39;One Wing Landing&#39; Viral Video 
computer graphic
@Anastassssssssssssss ow and the rc model used is made to do exactly this thing loose one wing and then land using its overpowerd engine like a choper. search for bill hempel flies with one wing and u will see ;)
one of the best amateur montage iv ever seen ;) keep up the good work! the only flaws are: 1 the real plane in the begginig, the pilot has white helmet and when he lands hard its black :0... 2 there are 3 blurs on the video 1 to change from the real to the rc model 2 to make it dificult to notice tht when it lands hard and jumps up n down the pilot actualy stays stil and 3 to change from rc to real plane (u will notice it because when it steers the right wing sudenly becomes bigger). 
that was pretty damn good.. until the shitty landing animation. +work on the shock drama XD
WOW.... Chuck Norris sure can fly... lol

fake shit
looks real.  BUT look at the rudder throws when it knife-edged before touchdown.

@DethDealer23  no shit
did he die?!
lol
fake

FAKE AND GAY

Fake. Ask for detail if you want, but there is SO MUCH wrong with this video it&#39;s obviously fake.
marked down for fakeness because it&#39;s a model.

fake as shit. but you probably could do this with a model airplane
owkaaaay     FAKE
it&#39;s a fake!
Seen this on tv &quot;is it true&quot;  two different planes! Fake
it would be possible because of how the plane was side ways becase tere is still thrust just less of it pointed down but this is  fake video it kinda lookslike a flight simlator at some parts
This is so funny, but it is fake, they already said it is fake, they used green screen or something for the Wing to disappear, technology people!
All you haters saying FAKE, do something with your life instead of typing up the same word everyday and annoying everyone. We can judge for ourselves what we think without your dumb-ass input. How is it Fake.

Oh yeh &quot;RRRRRRUUUUUUNNNNNN&quot;   :D
wow you guys are such critics
fake and gay
HI EARTHLINGS
of course its fake, if u look at the nose of the plane in the beginning and when it landed its different
WOW what a load of shit 

@DethDealer23 We don&#39;t care
It dosent matter if its fake the made it for the enjoyment of others.. not people saying its fake..

pro

when the wing goes off, the plane starts rolling in the wrong direction.. the remaining wing would pull that side UP.. not push it down..
Bloody Focking Fake !
LOL
fake
this is a stuiped video is it a joke or what ???????
These planes are made to do things like this. I mean really, if this was fake, then answer why the REAL plane has no right wing at the very end.
Exactly, this could not be possible, any pilot (real world or simulator(like myself)) would know that this is fake
Ferrari2060:
  You are smart and every one else is stupid, thanks for pointing out the obvious.
I bet you don&#39;t have a Ferrari
Probably 
Overstress
It is first a real plane then it is a modellairplane. I saw it at discovery channel. FAKE!
hahahahahahahaha how fake isnt that?
This is a fucking big fake.Anyhow a wing can never broke like that
Na wenn das keine Meisterleistung war.
it looked real at the start lloo
Ofcourse its fake you dumbfucks so stop saying that and i think this vid sucks :D
its actualy an RC plane
Animation...
It&#39;s fake but nice vid :P
FAKE!!!
Pause at 00:08 so that you can see the entire plane. Then look at the plane when it has landed. mmmmmm. Different colors? This is fake.
Fake and Bull Shit
Holy shit i think that guy shitted himself  0_o ?!
Two words, BS!
AWSOME!
very good cg nice job... very fake and impossible...
Ð¥Ñ€ÐµÐ½ÑŒ
Nice, very good quality althought it&#39;s fake.
definately possible ! u have to knife edge the plane using rudder and elevators.
Pretty much Impossible!..
It looks like a model airplane until the end anyway. I don&#39;t think it was meant to be believed, but just a cool vid.
its imposible to land that thing...fake vid
that was awsome LOL !!!
Oh my god! You saw that yeti in 0:48 in the forest? :O! It scares me!
lol.. the greenscreen stuff at the end isn&#39;t even close to being good. This has already been proven to be fake and as pointed out by others, is a commercial for advertising purposes.
its the naked truth. God give the pilot a piece of one&#39;s mind
its fake, the proof is that at 0:23, the plane is spiraling at the opposit way the wing should lift...
ive seen it too, but this plane was going slow and the body is cylindrical. + at 0:23 the plane is spiraling at the opposite side the wing should lift...
Best use of video editing I&#39;ve seen. The prop gives it away at the end.
F&amp;F -   FUNN AND FAKE  - LOL
genius idea. i almost believed it
Not to mention a plane will want to do nothing but roll and fall if it loses a wing.
lol &quot;RUN!&quot; *just stands there*
super fake but nice, thats just CGI for ya,
not really just not
Fake!! 
The camera guy shouted: Run!!!!!
But he didn&#39;t even take a step backwards lol
omg are you serious, you couldnt tell it was fake?!
Are you blind? i am into 3d animation and renders and i noticed that the shadow didn&#39;t meet the plane when it landed. and it looks fake as hell
are you blind?
You couldn&#39;t do that in a simulator it was such a good recovery.  Sweet.
un FUCKING believable! the greatest stunt pilot to ever walk the face of the Earth!
awesome pilot!!!!!!!
Scheis Fakermannn
Holy shit is awesome
Well, I&#39;m doing CGI and if this is one it&#39;s the f***ing best  I&#39;ve ever seen. 
It took my breath anyway.
That is some great CGI.
yup saw it too
Yeah, I saw it. That took some real skill.
its fake, but my teacher says it&#39;s not, but he&#39;s talkin out his arse
It&#39;s possible.

F-15 landing with one wing. Real story.
battyify    lol!
super fake
To poweredparagliding, What about the minutes after landing, it would be nice to see this great pilot. Please upload the rest. thanks.
lol its funny cuz battyify actually thinks its real =P
realy   a one winged plane would mostly toll around itself  and even if it doesn&#39;t   how can it stop in 4secs after flying at full speed?
now swearing?  or do you mean no swearing?
I know about 2 fighter jets who landed with 1 wing.
It is possible, but you need some hard out luck!
Fake, but first off you think it&#39;s real!
Until it lands.
welllll nottt fakee!!!!
Edit better people!
rc plane with maching a computer effect right?
its that phisicly possible ?? everybody can see that its a fake video but , i wonder if that could be done ? because that was awesome... one wing landing looks like a circus trick lol ^^
nice video ... 5/5
RC plane.

nice editting bro&#39;s. well done!
fake.
Didn&#39;t know it was CG until the landing, sweet.
f*cking fake!
SO FAKE! landing looked like a cartoon. and the &quot;wheres his right wing????&quot; why would u say that if a huge wing was falling from the sky and u can obviously see where it is you wouldnt say wheres his wing you would say &quot;holy shit his wing just fuckin fell off!!!&quot;
Quite obvious it&#39;s a radio controlled plane to start with into a cgi altered transition . Quite clever tho!
well done to the piolet for his share skill in landing that aircraft, well done
Bad jog...fake
i lol&#39;d
mmmmmm  cheesey
wow doesnt get any more fake then that! it was funny these 2 old  aviation buffs were talkin about this and were stunned by it. i watched 5 seconds of it and could tell the CG work  that was done on it lol
this is fake almost seemed like a really good graphics video game at the end
yes lol
wow that looks so cool let me try he he
Everyone knows it&#39;s not real... its computer generated anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot.
how does the right wing come back after it lands LOL
looks computer generated
HAHA...
This has made Galileo!
nette computer arbeit...
FAKE ;)
-_-
RC stands for (remote control_ an that is not an rc plane i mean yeah i know its fake near the end but for the best part of the beginning of this clip its a real plane watch red bull air race some then get back to me.
Well do you know what RC stands for? If you do then you will fnid that the size of the person would be quite normal (unless they have abnormalities otherwise) For starters look how fast it&#39;s moving. Would a normal sized plane, even one of that build, be able to spin around that fast? I don&#39;t think so.
its not an rc plane you idiot its the same style plane they use in the red bull air race if thats an rc plane id hate to think how big the person controlling it was lol.
it&#39;s not fake. It&#39;s just an RC plane
than he lands, u blur the screen, because it fake...
F 15 planes land with one wing pretty regular search
air force f 15 one wing
oops posted by mistake - ad for killa - may have been a happy mistake with the wing fallng off and such. It actually never goes to a real plane, it just has a pilot super imposed, look at the scale of the grass, and the prop when it stops. not saying a pilot couldn&#39;t do it - beacuse it may be possible, just THIS ONE is faked as can be - good show KILLA!!! (Killa-thrill  makes T shirts or something I forget)
Now swearing in my video comments!
snope it, it is an RC model. blurs at just the right moments, fades to a real plane at the end. notice the lack of cable, hydralic lines, etc. hanging out of the wing. This is not meant to fool you, it is an ad for Killa.
your right man this is computer made...
I believe this plane is a P51 Mustang ..  This is not impossible.. As he lands the plane he is full left aleron and full right rudder . this puts the plane into a slip normally.. in this case it is the planes power plant providing the lift necessary to pull this off.
the afterburner saved the plane, by building up speed so that the pilot could regain control
read the whole comment, and not just a part of it.
this is not an f-15 . belive me. it&#39;s fake
Hahahahahahaha!
it is a fake!!!!
i saw it on TV ! month ago...
they tested it and its a fake!
itÂ´s not possible to land this aircraft with one wing
was good until end haha laughed ass off
No... In reality, it couldn&#39;t be done.  What do you think keeps it in the air?!?!  It needs both wings to stay aloft.  With only one, it would spin into a continuous nose-dive...
looked pretty good till the end..whats the purpose in faking a crash landing it serves no purpose and nothing good.fiction
Got me untill the landing part! But well done!
PHONY BALONEY!!
Amazing how bad the camera man is when the bird is in the air.. but once it comes in to land.. its like they are runny beside the plane the whole time.. :O

Im so shocked.. RUUUUUNNN!.. thats what the camera person did.. in complete focus..

(Yes i know its fake)
well that was a good fake ..... no that&#39;s a lie it was a shit fake but it was funny 4/5
That&#39;s a great fake !
Wenn das ein Fake ist dann is es Super gemacht!
definitely
hahahah FAKEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
People who think this is real....AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHA
lucky shit
No this is just very good special effects. In fact, you can even tell from the lighting on the plane that CGI was used at the end. Also, why do you think it got blurry when the plane &quot;landed&quot;?
if you where a lucky person who knows :P
although this video is fake, landing with one wing is possible with a combat plane. check out the video of the israeli pilot that lands his f-15 with one wing after a midair collision during a training exercise.
wasn&#39;t that pilot lucky!!!
haha good video editing lol
I think this is fake, but very well done!!!! If I could do special effects like this I would of made something a bit more interesting!
of course its fake, that shouldnt even be up for debate. anyone who thinks its real is a incredible idiot. And um news flash, planes dont bounce like cartoons do. Nice realistic bounce on landing pause not.
so fake its not even funny
hahah   a plane at maybe full speed lands and 3secs later is&#39;t standing still? and if it only has 1 wing i&#39;d say it starts spinning
awesome! (:
all my ten thumbs up for that ;)
holy sht that must have taken some serous flyig skills to pull tha off
No PILOTS in the room and everyone is saying FAKE! It is NOT fake. For the few of you that know and understand ASC, analize the video (using pause) in it&#39;s entirety. The video clearly shows the pilot input to the controls were exactly proportionate to the attitude of the aircraft. The interview that followed was also explicit and detailed. The video AND the follow-up report is far beyond what any &#39;photo-shop&#39; artist could dream up. Nay-sayers go ahead, show your ignorance. True Pilots, ring in.
wow what a landing Good piloting . Wow
lol thats fake but for the pilots out there who ever may lose one of there wings thats the way of putting ur plane back on the ground safe and sound 
hahahaha
I saw a REAL vid of an aerobatic R/C plane (I believe same type, but 1/8 scale) that landed with one wing - I would have thought with this type of aircraft at least it would be somewhat feasible.
Very obviously fake. Anybody who doesn&#39;t see that is either blind or just plain stupid. Or maybe they should go to bed earlier from now on. It&#39;s true about the F-15 though, but this is no F-15.
No it&#39;s not. There was a F-15 Eagle fighter which collided in mid air with another plane, also loosing one of its wings, and landed safely. The guys from McDonell Douglas also did not believed it, but the vid is also here in &#39;tube. Go ahead for it dude ;-)
you REALLY think so? jeez...
so fake
Holy crap, even airfield-related people aren&#39;t sure if it&#39;s fake. WTF is wrong with you people!
Its fake u dumb fucks... God dont u you see when he lands its computer generated... And plane bounces without smashing to pieces...
lol some people just dont understand sarcasm do they?
i met this pilot recently at a charity lunch, he is called Klaus, he received a special award for airmanship, he also is a very keen yachtsman.
Can you say F-A-K-E?
wow, this pilot is  really skillful, a lot of aircraft that lose wings end up crashing.
If they straitened out the landing it would be believable. Right now it&#39;s good up until the plane rights itself and plants all wheels on the ground at the same time really fast at the end.
omg, that one is so fake :p
I you went to the same school as taht guy, you would be following ICT and learning how to make fake videos ^^
Well, the landing is probably a real RC model, but the pilot coming out of the plane is some kind of cgi trick to make you think a pilot maneuvered that.
Bill Hemple and his radio controlled fall away wink trick. How funny!

Debunked here: watch?v=I89EMDZ0dsc&amp;eurl

There was no skilled pilot. Everything but the landing is real.
He went into a high angle of attack to generate a little lift from his body and a lot of lifting thrust from his propeller. If it&#39;s fake, the video maker understood the forces involved.
No, the colored marking is the underside. His left wing underside is shown.
There are two things that give it away. First of all, the plane dissapears from the screen due to a camera wobble just before it looses its wing. This is a classic CGI trick. What they do is they have real footage of the plane/other vehicle and then it dissapears from view. What they&#39;ve actually done is video&#39;ed the plane in flight and when they loose it from the picture, they keep filming near to where the plane would have been flying if it had had the accident.
This means that you can&#39;t really see what&#39;s hapenning. It is very good though. The way they loose focus and the instability of the recording does make it look it has been done by an amateur. Apart from the bounce on the landing, I&#39;d give them 10/10.

THEN they add to the film the CGI plane.  It&#39;s very, very well done this piece of footage, but the real and second giveaway for me is the way that it bounces when it hits the floor.  Not only does the plane bounce too high for the entry speed and angle of approach for a vehicle of this size and weight, but the camera blur&#39;s right at that moment that it lands, meaning that you don&#39;t get a truly accurate view of the physics applied to the CGI model.

Yep your are right, i fly a slingsby and that landing like that would have crushed the oleo
Me Too man....Me too!
well, its not impossible to land a plane with one wing, it been done with an F15. but this one really does not look real. so, being an amateur cgi designer, i must appreciate how well made the video is. but i doubt its real.
i put this in sony vegas and saw thw frame by frame action and you cann se its fake !
lol any retards thinks this is real go on a walk of shame, and i dont even think its an rc model it just looks like shitty cgi, and want to know whats really pathetic, this was on australia&#39;s channel seven (one of the big four networks) national news, and she said &quot;a rising clip on youtube bla bla bla about vid, then said &quot;they are not sure whether it is real or not&quot; and i just laughed my ass off, first off for them doing it on national tv, and second cant tell its fake, gotta love the news =)
you muppets this is real.... flown by a stunt pilot. he landed and lived you are only jalouse that he is one very lucky and good pilot. rc model? nice rc pilot that opens the canopy. if you guys knew how to fly you would take of your hat and salute him...well done sir, sorry about all the muppet comments from the others...
Ja bezeichne mich doch als Voltrtottel! Tun se doch alle! Alles Idis!!!
If you can&#39;t see that this is fake you are a complete fucking idiot. A 10 year old could see this is fake. The people who ask if this is fake, probably go to see star wars and ask if that is fake as well.
cool fake
so you are saying this landing is real?

one wing landings are possible, but not this particular landing.
Es ist ein Fake!denn 
-1.ich hab damals mal Notruf gern gesehen,  darunter war auch ein Flugzeugbeitrag, wo einer so rumflog, ein StÃ¼ck TragflÃ¤che verrlor, und dann lebensgefÃ¤hlich abstÃ¼rzte. 
-2. Galileo hats aufgedeckt XD
OK the video in this link is a TRUE story. I had a friend of mine who was in the same squadron as me at the Air Force Academy. He was a crew chief for F-15&#39;s. He told me about this story. I thought he was nutz. 

watch?v=-_EXtBEaBbs

Till i found this!
esse fake foi foda
Actually, some planes can fly and even land without a wing, namely certain fighter jets.  That&#39;s because they have enough power to turn themselves into rockets (rockets don&#39;t need wings to fly).  It&#39;s been done.  But that doesn&#39;t apply here; this is obviously an RC plane.
Sure it&#39;s not hard to see - if it was then people wouldn&#39;t be ranting about it left and right and it would be &quot;just another one wing landing&quot; video...lol
The funny part is that all those imperfections were actually included by purpose to heat the discussion and therefore let the rumor spread more rapidly! 3 million clicks on the virtual pilot&#39;s fake web site in 6 weeks isn&#39;t bad at all!
klar ^^ warum nich :D
Cool &quot;mein&quot; video is beruehmt!...hahaha
lol das hat gallileo gemacht XD an German TV show (names: gallileo) make this video for a test !!!!!!!!!!!
ruuuuuun
lol so fake
bad fake :D
Pro7-Galileo 16.12.09
Totaly fake, the camera at the last moment is tracked on the aircraft, some screams to dramatize the situation, and a lot of fools believing that shit. No plane can fly without wings, not even land safely. I&#39;m a fool too, commenting this video...
see this
watch?v=-_EXtBEaBbs&amp;feature=related
I believe I believe I believe.
It was real.  I know because I&#39;m the pilot.  Two wings is for pussies!
And what aircraft do you fly that has such an unorthodox arrangment for storing fuel?  Unless it is a multi-engine aircraft that somehow has the cockpit directly in the middle of the feuselage between the wings, there is no way your claim can be true.
Look at the F-15 flown by the Israeli Air Force pilot.  He seemed to fare well with only one wing.
The pilot is directly behind the engines dipshit.
actually most stunt/race aircraft do not have ejection seats because the are extremely heavy.
you are joking right?

SERIOUSLY!

Its alright, the first time I saw it, I thought it was real too. But once you think about it, its sort of obvious.
Sorry kids but this video was faked. It had me sold that it was real also until I saw on several sites how it was done. That was a radio-controlled plane that lost its wing as they use a building technique different from full-sized aircraft in joining the wings.
Of course it&#39;s a fake. It&#39;s just funny to see how many people are arguing about something such evident :)
wnd then again, it&#39;s good fake. LOL
this is not fake, it&#39;s a brilliant stunt.
the wing did not break, the pilot chose to detatch the wing at certain moment when he felt the plane is under control.
if the wing was to break, it should have broken at sec 10 of the video when the wing was under high stress, but it broke (detached) under less stress.
control wires in the wing are the strngest thig in the plane, they don&#39;t just vanish when a wing breaks.
Yes also fill me in cause this is disappointing
The fakest thing I&#39;ve ever seen on here. The way it stopped as soon as it hit the ground was like something out of a Road Runner cartoon.
fuel in wings is true but not in all cases. many airplanes have it directly behind the engine. not sure how this one is rigged up though
when you guys learn how to use CG please inform me
Without speaking on the possibility of piloting a plane like that, just look at the engineering perspective. The wings of an aircraft are FILLED with fuel, if one was to snap off all that fuel would be in the air, assuming there was no spark to ignite it from the wing ripping off.  Also, the moment created by the spin on landing would be far too much for the landing gear of a real plane to handle. Models have much lighter constructions and so the force wouldn&#39;t be as great.
Those &#39;dick heads&#39; that think it&#39;s a fake should have seen the scale plane I saw do just the same thing. Sure the pilot was on the ground controlling the plane, but he performed the same manoeuvre.
Mechanics? I think aerodynamics is the word. Sure you can &quot;hang&quot; a plane from a propeller, but you cannot control the landing without aerodynamic control. And jets are engines too, you must have meant piston powered versus jet powered. It&#39;s an obvious fake.
this video just looks fake to me. Landing with a single wing certainly is possible within reason, but there&#39;s something very computer animated about this whole thing
there wasn&#39;t enough forward motion to give the aileron any effect...i remember having a dream like this when i was first learning to fly...dreaming of hanging my damaged plane on the prop until i could gently lower to the ground...
but that was just a dream, i&#39;m afraid.
there IS a great vdo about an F15 that survived a mid-air, in Israel, i think.
Yes it would, if you dont acount for it, in you flight controls. I&#39;m with you that this is fake, but there are actually a company, which have succesfully developed a flight control system, that can compensate up to 60% wing loss, and keep the airplane stable.

Looking for the movie clip, cause it is quite amazing.
if the wing fell off, would the lift of the remaining wing tumble the plane the other way?  very clever fake...
Well congrats to whoever did make the fake, certainly well worth discussing here on youtube.

Congrats to the original person who edited Flight sim vid to make it look like a real one.
Fake.  R/C aircraft landing bounce. go to snopes com and search one wing landing.
Completely fake.  The &quot;landing&quot; is clearly CG.
this is fake. google &quot;killathrill one wing&quot; and read the first result.
Realy good fake.. If you see it carefully you can see that when plane is landing, background looks like made by computer. And when the plane stoped on the ground, it is reversed side with wing and second wing isnt be possible to see. And all video is unreal for me. Bud i think that this landing is possible to do it.
It is possible, but I wouldn&#39;t try it :D
take care ;)
Grtz
True they can &quot;hover&quot; but there is not a chance that this vid is real, it might be possible to do, but I wouldn&#39;t recommand it :D

I know that video shake anywhere.
Interesting forgery, but the physics of the &quot;landing&quot; are all wrong, as are the maneuvers performed after the wing comes off.  There are also inconsistencies in the plane&#39;s dimensions and markings.
I just got this in an email and I just cant belive it. Is it real?
The wing simply fell off!  No sign of stress or tearing when the plane lands, just a clean edge, as if the wing was purposefully taken off.  Looks faked to me.
Hahaha good one!
it is not fake! it&#39;s reaaaal! u can see also the shadow.. the plane is landing on the moon!, and he is a lizard man! see his eye! in a cloud you can see also ciu ciu charlie! if u try to see the video  in slow motion appeara an advertisement of malboro... 
reeeeal!
It&#39;s fake. There was no writing on the left wing untill he comes in for the landing.
fake, to fly knife edge requires full top rudder. top rudder is exactly that, full rudder to the side that is &quot;top&quot;. in this case, he would have full left rudder to knife edge the landing approach. furthermore, the camera follows the plane abreast as opposed to the camera being stationary and perspective making the plane appear smaller in the landing rollout. boo hiss
The pilot is a well know stunt pilot and air racer names James Andersson (yes 2 s&#39;s) Look it up, his site shows him explaining the circumstances behind the mishap.
it looks fake
Agreed.
He has a set bigger than bowling balls.
montagem escrota e ridicula !!!
Fake as hell!
i saw that i agree you think there is something more pressing than this
I need a drink, a cigar, A new pair of shorts, &amp; the dumb ass that fixed my plane!
fake
Prop came to a halt too quickly.
I was there.  Its totally real.
There is a moment of discontinuity at about 51sec. A witness cries out &#39;Amaz-&#39;, and there is a tiny shudder in the whole image. The surprising deceleration is right after that point.
Yeah...seems kinda fakeish due to unreliable camera angles.  There *was* an F-16 that did land with almost no wing on the starboard side.
no wa s that real?
