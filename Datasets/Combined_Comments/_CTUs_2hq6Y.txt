I love the intro
It&#39;s 2024 and 5G still has not met the hype. A speedtest on my Verizon phone with the most expensive plan is yielding 180 mbps. Well short of the 1000 mbps advertised..
Hey can you test 5G now, it&#39;s been 4 years. It will good how much progress they&#39;ve make since then
A bit more information about non-ionising radiation. Man-made nonionising radiation is fundamentally different from natural nonionising radiation in that it is polarised, modulated and pulses at extremely high frequencies.<br><br>All living organisms adapted over millennia to natural nonionising radiation but have not had time to adapt to this new and toxic energy.<br><br>There are 1000&#39;s of studies showing biologically harmful effects from EMR, including cancer. The US Navy conducted research into the biological effects of microwaves in the 1950s. They produced a 174 document detailing harmful effects. Somehow this research has been overlooked or could it be it is deliberately ignored?
Its ending of 2023 bruh
I‚Äôm still waiting for people to turn to Zombies because of 5G according to gullible Conspiracy theorist people.
As we gain technological improvements, we immediately find newer and more trivial uses for the capacity. That adds to the burden on the infrastructure and strains our bandwidth budget. We endlessly pay more to be perpetually disappointed by what we have bought.
1-4 g no problems 5g + China = problems
2023 this video still holds up :D
.
No one else got the forgey joke? üëÄokay.
Great introduction. Hahaha
Didn‚Äôt they think of stuff like the short range and buildings blocking it before starting to implement it?<br>It almost seems like it should be a gigantic failure or even a scandal but I‚Äôve never heard of it. Don‚Äôt have a 5g phone and i thought it was just implemented and running perfectly. This is honestly the first time i heard that there‚Äôs something wrong with it
It is now 100 Years since the first Radio Signal had been send out, and received an Answer instantaneously. The Realm of the Others had been intruded, cheekily, impudently, by Stupidity, and since then, they had not received a correct Answer, or a Thought about it, having our Kind expanding further, and further, into Something, that should not had happend, and you would call me maniacal for This, what I am pointing out here. So, they crossed the Borders, to our Realm, too, ending up as stupid, by our Realm, same, as what they had, as their Problem with us. No Solutions, But Problems, and Troubles. Bring it back a normal, sane, Level, Humanoid Kind.
In our area here in Australia, Telstra 5G runs at 10mbps, might as well go back to 3G.
Watching this from my 5G phone ü§≥
I have 5g here in Amsterdam and it&#39;s very fast, way faster than the cable internet,what is crappy here.<br> So crappy that I switched over to Starlink till we have glasfiber at the end of the year. (2023).
almost 4 years later. shit barely works even in the city
So what&#39;s the difference between 5g sub 6 and 5mm waves
1600 quid for a phone wow pal u gotta bit of disposable cash
Why are you talking about surgery over 5G. Won&#39;t that be on a fiber internet connection with standard wired ethernet? Although, the ping is really what matters the most, so if you can get the stream latency down under 100ms, 5G is going to be worth it&#39;s weight in gold. I still think the actual device might be hardwired to a 5G node, though. That&#39;s definitely the next step. Direct router connections to 5G nodes that uses the same technology to provide wired internet to a building.
This was my 1st MKBHD video
Because the network operator thinks that users will often go out, the operator has installed a frequency band that cannot penetrate walls well
5g still sucks
4 years ago and 5G is still shi**&quot;

Watching this video in 2023... on 5G on an iPhone 13... with 1gbps speeds‚ù§love humanity progress. I live in india and i almost get 5G everywhere in my city
However, no mention about impact on healt. Heavnt read the latest, so what is the conclusion? :)
thats what most of CURIOUS ppl need to see, even elder ppl
5G will be the end of the planet. Do your homework and research bro, before you start plugging something like this for the big tech companies who use you as a puppet. Get informed...but not here and not on google...they all plug the same narrative.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTUs_2hq6Y&amp;t=413">6:53</a>
Does 5g have any effect on voice or is it just data?
Thanks for your great explaination. there are many videos here who also have high percentage of likes but still explain it vary bad. Yours was awesome. Tnx üôè
5G still sucks! What a waste of money üòÇ &quot;Sprint&quot; ü§£
3 years later and it&#39;s still shit. I wish I could turn mine off and stick to 4g.
Can you make 2022 video of 5G
There‚Äôs levels to this huh Shawn carter
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTUs_2hq6Y&amp;t=420">7:00</a> This looks like a fantastic high-level assignment for computer science majors. You have to make a program that, given an arbitrary choice of terrain layout, can cover 95% of terrain with 5g line of sight while minimizing the number of nodes needed. No idea how it would be done but I&#39;m sure it is possible lol
I recently got a new phone which supports 5G.<br>So far it‚Äôs only slightly more relatable in the areas that I work at as it still shuts off after awhile longer than LTE.
1k plus speed test bruhhhhh where?

Today 3 years later still the most informative and quality video on YouTube about 5G
Currently I am impressed !!!
How much did you say that samsung costs
Americans so dumb they don&#39;t even have 5G but believe what their Internet company tells them lol üòÇ It&#39;s banned in the US üö´ but I got told so often look at my 5g phone dude and than downloading a movie in 4k takes like much more than a minute lol
It&#39;s not about high speed, it&#39;s always about CONSISTENT and LOW PING. <br>Even when 6g enters the market, if it comes with variations then there is no use of it. <br>For me constant 50mbps and 20 ping without any drop is more than sufficient.
Science addicts, aka scientism cult members, will deny that there‚Äôs anything harmful about 5g or other emf sources. As for normal critical thinking open minded individuals, the truth is in plain sight; considering the hundreds of scientific studies PROVING the dangers of EMF‚Ä¶. We can not and will not be fooled!
stay far away from it.
They put up stop signs and traffic lights.
Good vid. Thank you.
5G still hasn&#39;t rolled out in most of scandinavia... #1 most overhyped technology of the 2010s
Thank you for this very informative and thorough video!
well on 4g i got 600mbps but my friend for 850mbps down on 4g and 1.8gbps down on 5g 2100mhz not even mmwave and 20mhz bandwidth and DSS but 3.5ghz in around corner with 100mhz bandwidth so we will get above 2-3gbps all around the country (BTW lithuania will have nationwide UWB (3.5-3.7Ghz from 3 operators)
Thanks!
Nice video on 5G üëåüèª
I loved that intro!
Does 5g give cancer?
Would those 5G nodes allow precision telemetry?
I&#39;m so like sick of like waiting any more then Like 3 seconds for a page to upload. Like I don&#39;t even care if it&#39;s harmful to like my body
The fun fact for personal use 100mbps is more than enough.
Sweet propoganda
$1600 for a phone?  I paid $573 (CDN) for my Pixel 6 last October.  I got it 2 days after it was announced.  Also, 5G does not always mean mmWave.  It can be on any cell band.
I am sitting inside my house in Norway with heavy rain outside with 5G on my phone. Why is this such a big deal? I don&#39;t get the hype. It is just normal.
Why 5G in Mesa AZ is a P of S, tried Verizon, change to Tmobil, and still a P of Shi?. ?
I‚Äôm looking for more bars not speed 4g lte is just fine
The only reason why he signal was fast caz he see a cell tower
Mediatek is doing so well these days though! The Dimensity 1300 is here and finally a solid chipset for mid-range devices
Yeh but has 5g been proven and tested to be safe? High EMFs are very dangerous to health, environment and wildlife
How many gigabytes does a car need to download in an hour? On many roads there isn&#39;t even a basic phone signal, let alone internet. Why do doctors need to do surgery on a phone internet connection, and not on a wired internet line (with a backup line)? All this is propaganda (marketing), just like Bill Gates&#39;s propaganda from 25 years ago about the internet.
No talk about how this same tech is used for military electronic warfare systems.
In the real world, 4G is LTE and LTE is 3.5G.<br>5G is 4G.

14ms latency??? hahahahahahahahah
What cure do you have for 5G related helth issues if people and annimals have to suffer from the 5G radiations? What will you use to replace bees and small birds? Is that a crime against humanity?
5g
<b>*Suffers with 5 Mbps 4G in India*</b>
Outstanding work!
5g emits dangerous levels of electromagnetic radiation which harms all living beings &amp; plant life.<br>Promoting 5g is terrorism, child abuse, elderly abuse, animal abuse &amp; environmental pollution

His 5G Speed: 1000+ MBps<br>Meanwhile my internet and wifi here in indonesia: 30 mbps
Can you talk about this again this year?
My 3g is faster then my Wi-Fi at my houseüò≠
doesn&#39;t make any sense to me cuz short range faster connection is kind of personal area network system rather than wide/metropolitan area network system.<br><br>i get 150mbps broadband 5ghz and i love it.
Firstly, I want to make very clear I&#39;m not against 5G, and I don&#39;t believe in any conspiracies whatsoever. Especially when the theories link it to COVID-19 or vaccines.<br><br>Also, if you want super fast mobile internet, I don&#39;t want to interfere with that.<br><br>However, I think every country (for small countries) or state/region (for large countries) should have a white zone for people who became ill due electrohypersensitivity (EHS), like myself. A place where there is not even 4G or 3G, so we can live within humane conditions and don&#39;t become sicker every day. Basically like the US radio quiet zone, but with basic facilities, like a low-EMF hospital, phone booths, Low-EMF post office, a low-EMF supermarket, etc. where the people living here can work in conditions that don&#39;t make them sick. Also, the location should not be close to any radar or power lines.<br><br>Furthermore, I&#39;m not claiming the majority of people with burnout are electrohypersensitive, but now and then I hear stories of people first being misdiagnosed with burnout. And later they realize they can function much better when they manage their EMF-exposure. Recovery often takes a while and as soon as exposure goes up again, their sensitivity increases again.<br><br>My own symptoms are different: vision loss, memory loss, speech problems, sweating, disorientation, etc. and they are pretty bad at the moment, but I try to stay positive, and I&#39;m constantly finding new ways to cope with this illness.<br><br>The reason I comment this is that I want to spread awareness of this condition which is still unrecognized in most countries, without polarizing. üôÇ<br><br>I have no judgements against people who believe in any conspiracies regarding 5G though, I understand it can seem like an easy explanation for people who observe radiation having an impact don&#39;t their bodies.<br><br>On the other hand, I&#39;m not denying there is also a huge psychological factor affecting this disease, including for myself. If one to whom this happens is very fearful, it also contributes a lot to this disease. However, long exposure as well short exposure to high peaks also worsens people&#39;s sensitivity, which brings a lot of fear into their life as well. This makes it extremely hard to turn off the fear switch for many people suffering from EHS, often resulting in a downward spiral. 5G conspiracies also certainly don&#39;t help, as they create more fear for people with EHS on the one hand, but 5G itself doesn&#39;t really help on the other hand. Nor does 4G, 3G, Wi-Fi, microwaves, power lines, etc.<br><br>Nonetheless, companies invested a lot in 5G, so they are not going to stop it. However, many people with EHS are against 5G for everyone, not just themselves. I&#39;m not claiming 5G healthy, but other types of pollution are probably far worse for the general population. Heavy metal pollution, for example. It&#39;s the same as if a nightshade intolerant person would want to boycott companies producing nightshades for everyone, even though it might not be the healthiest thing on earth. I think the EHS community is shooting in their own feet with these viewpoints because it could trigger polarization.<br><br>However, I think everyone can have their cake and eat it too. Pragmatism is the key to this.<br><br>Please note that I might be wrong about any information I provide here, and if you are more than welcome to correct this. üôÇ

6g will make people disappear if aren‚Äôt aliens
5th generation milliwave wireless communications were proven in the Clinton administration era 1996 or so to cook blood and any other single cell systems. Yet put into Law that it will be pushed on you regardless of proven evidence of harmful radio frequency poisoning. Invoking a immune response to create corona to remove this nasty radio frequency poisoning out of your body. <br>Only Jesus saves for free.

Windsor, CT? Which Windsor, south or east? Is there a straight up Windsor? Idr that.... lol
Hi, I was wondering if you would do a follow-up assessment of 5g since you mentioned that the cons outweighed the pros back in 2019. Also I really liked this video, thank you!
elon will put his 5g nodes on all his vehicles.
Don&#39;t forget, T-Mobile has the most reliable 5G network.

Higher radiation
Are you all so sure that high exposure for decades will not cause any damage?
We have 5G here in Japan.
Interestingly, it almost feels like they wanna make it easier to track a persons location right down to the block based on where their phone pings. Hmmmm‚Ä¶.sketchy and probably a huge privacy breach.
Why is 5 g really needed?
Has this tech improved at all since this video was made?
Got a 5g phone 1.5mbps on 4g 155mbps???????
So good cinematic intro :)
I am interested to know why the upload speed isn&#39;t higher, I would have thought that even with them devoting most of the signal power for downloads, for obvious reasons, they would have at least had the ability to give the uploads more bandwidth?
I heard phones are blowing up because phones cant handle  it
Outstanding!
5g city?
Nice intro dude
Just caught this now-nice to understand-the big drawback if I can throw this in 5G my understanding was never for the consumer sorry Verizon hype-meant for automated industrial systems and robotics within a facility to speak to each other without having to go out to the web each time for faster automated response *
At home on WiFi watching this in 480p. Because I don&#39;t care about 120fps and being able to see the individual hairs on someone&#39;s face. Good content has almost nothing to do with visual quality. <br><br>Good video and great info thanks üëç
Hey Marques! Thank you so much for this helps me so much. I just noticed in your video. I hope your arm is ok? I am so happy you visited my home city Providence. Thank you again.
The real problem &quot; Is expensive&quot;
Wait! How did you get 14 million subscribers? Like..what? Happy for you, but, really, how?
From 2021, situation is still roughly the same. And everything you mentioned is still totally pertinent, unfortunately.
Ok, so I finally get a 5G phone with free limited 5G data. When I go over that 5G data it throttles down to 3G. What happened to 4G lte? I asked my carrier this (T-Mobile) and they didn&#39;t know. Does anybody know?
So like True North and Magnetic North ...
What about health concerns ?
I&#39;m OG what I need 5g Foe!
NWA the original 5 gs
I have a 5g s21 and it is no where better or faster than my 4g s10. Why did i even bother upgrading.
My T mobile 5G works pretty well
I build the networks for 5G it uses 10Gig Ethernet from the cell sites, 4G uses 1Gig,you are correct about lower power budget&#39;s here in the UK we need to build an extra 60K cell sites to get total network coverage.
Lol well it‚Äôs almost 2022 and in Ohio we got the lil nodes then the huge big towers. Except I can‚Äôt tell the difference between a 5g tower and 4g tower
That intro killed me
Who owns 4G &amp; 5G?
This is not safe. Do your research man don‚Äôt be a sell out for these tech companies trying to get sponsorships. It‚Äôs clearly unsafe the studies are there 5G is NOT SAFE
Funny is I am watching this on my Galaxy S10 5G that can&#39;t get 5G because it&#39;s korean variant ü§£
When can we get rid of these ugly ass wires we&#39;ve coated the world with!
No-one But me: 5G means more expensive and Faster internet
Most places in the world still don&#39;t even have proper 4G.<br><br>They try to market &quot;LTE&quot; which is just a slightly faster version of 3G üòë
We are seeing the effects of the national &amp; world rollout of 5G.
I really want %G in my town, like with 4G we usually get 40 or 60. But With 5g even standing behind a wall 200 or 300 sounds heaven

Thx, would you please cover the potential HARM of electrical magnetic radiation of 5G? (Cancer, slow growing brain tumors, etc.)
Fun fact everyone watched this in 4G
If the plan is to put down more 5G towers, AT&amp;T must be gambling that they are going to make their money back. They are counting on the idea that 5G is going to be popular.
Watching in 2021, this is great and it&#39;s amazing to see how you&#39;re so on point with what is on the horizon! I left my carrier for a certain one that Deadpool recommended and I&#39;m very happy with it especially for the price, and living in the DMV 5g is very accessible.  But yeah, the drawbacks are noticable as I work for the railroads and when I leave the metro hubs it goes back to 4g.  But hey, a 5g capable phone running on a 4g network feels like a VR capable PC rig running a single screen FPS game and it still feels nice.  And when I get back in around 5G areas holy effing eff it is noticable!<br><br>And yo just for the conspiracy lulz, still no crowny virus, here.

If 5G is so safe, why is the epidemiologist who had smoking banned in aeroplanes, now challenging the FCC about wireless radiation standards. Heart palpitations, brain fog, tinatis and depression are now being recorded at record levels and this ignorant idiot is bragging to the world about how amazing 5G is! Wake up!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTUs_2hq6Y&amp;t=183">3:03</a> the reason that microwaves don‚Äôt cook things outside the glass is because of the metal grill with the small holes that blocks the microwaves but let‚Äôs visible light through. In practice, microwave (2.45 GHz) and 2.4 GHz WiFi are practically the same thing it‚Äôs just that one has intensity of about 1000-10000x stronger.
I had verizon and they wanted me get a 5G phone when t wasn&#39;t in my area. But get this a small town in NY and t mobile had 5G. So I switched to them I! Also paying less for better service

Thanks for making this video.  I heard some people say that 5G was going to be the next internet or some shit like that and that you should put all your money into it right now.  This video makes me understand that maybe it&#39;s a good investment, but it&#39;s probably not going to be like buying bitcoin 5 years ago or even probably like buying APPL.

Hey does 5G work on iPhone X?
How I wish to live in China!
Why do we need to increase latency from 45ms to 1 ms? Unless machines are going to think for us?
its  2021 and  5G  problems still have  not been fixed and is just another way to  gouge  money from you, the networks lie  to you about the speed  because  just like the Internet  they wind  down the   speed to save money and  to try and move you on to  another  supposed  better  phone.<br>5G  is a con and even though they will all go 5G  eventually and will get charged more  it will not be  worth the money.

So thought I&#39;d chime in here because I thought it was interesting. Just got a 5g enabled phone, so I decided to do a speed test. The speeds were faster on 4g then they were on 5g. So I decided to take a look at where the closest 5g antenna was. turns out they put one literally ON TOP of my roof. So I did the speed test from my balcony and I saw a 125% increase in speed! Absolutely crazy. It&#39;s a funny example to show how directional 5g can be, even a single layer of roof can basically cripple 5g right now
In Mauritania we just got 4G
I still can&#39;t believe they mount the cellular antenna on utility power poles. Un-heard of here in Alberta.

$1000.00 phone? LTE Stands for Long-term evolution that means it will take a long time to implement.
My concerns are for the lives of not only this generation but any generation to come. As not only a nation but as the world we have been lied to from the moment we entered schools. Not by any knowing account of the school system but a system that has been deceptive and sadistic to almost every man, woman and child on this planet. In this time and day having knowledge of our rights will put someone like myself under attack and it was best explained by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently when he won the forced vaccinations they were trying to force on our children but he knew the truth behind these vaccinations. He speaks of Hitler&#39;s right hand man that stated how easily it was to take good people and make them do horrific crimes against humanity, horrible things ever recorded in history. How was that possible? Fear can control anyone if they allow it. He reminds us the only thing to Fear is Fear itself and he states that most people do not really understand what that really means.¬†<br>2020 Was a pivotal point in my life, up until then I was like most. I believed everything I was told and never questioned the governing body, I mean why should I right? Even though through countless times through our history they admit to poisoning our water and our food but would this government create such a big lie that would cause so much collateral damage in death and small businesses that the only people who really benefited from this entire pandemic was the wealthy. Do you think that was just a coincidence?¬†¬†<br>I haven&#39;t even began to share my story. Which most are so quick to roll their eyes or shrug their shoulders because they were prepared that there would be people who would try to expose their lie so they beat them to first base, not the home run because I will not give up along with the 26,000 doctors and scientist who tried stopping the roll out of the 5G, the cell towers are right next to your school.¬†<br>Did you know that in 2004 Fire stations in California had cell towers removed and they are not to be put near the Firefighters or the station and did you know it was at 2G because they caused known brain damage. Did you know that they were experimenting on teachers and children in Amarillo Texas at 3G and my friend Lena Pu did blood studies showing Rouleaux formation which is red blood cell damage that is caused by High Frequency Cavitation- resulting in hypoxia. The symptoms have been declassified since 1972. Who did the study to find the effects of waves on the blood and water (we are predominantly made up of water) no other then a Nazi Criminal ( Herman P Schwan) who was brought here by???????? Yes, our wonderful government. These symptoms that I will attach are from Herman P Schwan. He worked for the University of Pennsylvania and the Navy.¬†<br>Radio waves were introduced into our bodies in 1895 and soon after military operators started getting sick, there symptoms were even fatal as they developed hypoxia and causing pneumonia, bronchitis, c infections, infections, fever, heart and nerve problems just to name a few.<br>This should be no surprise that people in Wuhan started getting sick after they rolled out over 10,000 cell towers at 6GHZ. Some professionals argue that the cell towers wave range is only 150 feet, but they have to send waves to your phones and this is the vital part that was left from their education, when the wave is sent to the phone the piezoelectric crystal in your phone creates a CORONA DISCHARGE when you receive a notification or a message. Furthermore this Raw Radiation That causes the symptoms is known as Acute Radiation Sickness, and can be tested by a RF meter. In March of 2020 Trump signed the Beyond Act- the roll out of 5G. The act tries to keep anyone from standing in the way of Artificial Intelligence that is not sustainable to life. The mask they try and force people to wear are depleting us from oxygen which is what are bodies are already struggling dealing with from the role out of the towers. People seem to be so concerned about a virus they have never been able to prove rather a picture of a protein that just happens to be the same protein that is the result of the bioeffects from the radio wave and a mutation of a protein. Which is consistent with these test they have people take.<br>All this wisdom is a blessing from God because I would have never known this information if I was a nurse or a doctor but I was a ultrasound tech working at the University of California. Most see sick people or even see people die. 30 years of experience in helping people was my passion so after the role out I started seeing extensive wave¬†interference¬†in my ultrasound studies, increased miscarriages, then I started seeing the Rouleaux formation which led me to Lena Pu- Bitchute and the effects of high frequency cavitation on red blood cells. The Raw Radiation is measured in dosages and it is dependent on so many variables if we are symptomatic or not. Even the chemtrails have everything to do with us breathing in the toxins. Trump discovered how lethal the chemtrails were but somehow never stopped them from spraying. There were many other findings while I worked at the hospital.<br>I also know a few great people like Peggy Hall in OC, the mask mandate in any place needs to be removed immediately. No government, no corporation which includes schools has any jurisdiction over any person or their bodies. Every teacher and student and ever one in those neighborhoods are being affected. We need people to know their rights and know that all we have to do is speak up. Go to Peggy Hall on You Tube also Mariam Lindbeck with Safetech in Santa Barbara. These children need for us to protect them and not from a virus, know that the blue mask contain EO which is toxic to the Reproductive organs.<br>All these racism factions are only a distraction. Lets stand together and bring down the real enemy who creates the racism and has for centuries.<br>Please forward this message to the top.¬†<br>They tried burring us but what they did not realize is that we were seeds.<br>Glory to God, the King of Kings and LORD of ALL Lords. Our creator opened my eyes and the wisdom I can&#39;t deny.<br>Fasting and Prayer has changed the course of Human History. Do not be afraid and do not walk in ignorance. Wisdom is Power.

Your video fails to demonstrate the scientific (R&amp;D) impacts of a persons health being in consistent radius of such a network. You vaguely spoke about heat but nothing on the impacts that would have for people especially children.
you just said , the 5G bounces off hard things and is absorbed by soft or wet things , like ooo i don&#39;t know rain or people , ahrrrr , did you stand behind a person or 2 people or 3 or 4 , if not , that must be your next video  will keep an eye on ya ;} , anyway , would you really to live in that place with your loved ones , also , when do you need to download a 2 hour film in 2 seconds ? , big hugs , tom.

DNA is built from charged electrons and atoms and has an inductor-like structure. This structure could be divided into linear, toroid and round inductors. Inductors interact with external electromagnetic waves, move and produce some extra waves within the cells. The shapes of these waves are similar to shapes of hexagonal and pentagonal bases of their DNA source. These waves produce some holes in liquids within the nucleus. To fill these holes, some extra hexagonal and pentagonal bases are produced. These bases could join to each other and form virus-like structures such as C V. To produce these viruses within a cell, it is necessary that the wavelength of external waves be shorter than the size of the cell. Thus Five G millimeter waves could be good candidates for applying in constructing virus-like structures such as C Ves (COVID-19) within cells.<br><br>Keywords: Five G technology; COVID-19; DNA; dermatologic antenna; inductor; millimetre wave.<br><br>We found out from NIH<br><br>Protection of the population health from electromagnetic hazards ‚Äì challenges resulting from the implementation of the Five G network planned in Poland<br><br>Marek Zmy≈õlony 1, Pawe≈Ç Bie≈Ñkowski 2, Alicja Bortkiewicz 3, Jolanta Karpowicz 4, Jaros≈Çaw Kieliszek 5, Piotr Polita≈Ñski 1, Konrad Rydzy≈Ñski 6<br><br>Affiliations<br><br>    1Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof.

Concerns about safety and health hazards resulting from the influence of the electromagnetic field (EMF) emitted by the designed Five G antennas have been raised. In Poland, the level of the population‚Äôs exposure to EMF is limited to 7 V/m for frequencies above 300 MHz. This limitation results from taking into account the protective measures related not only to direct thermal hazards, but also to diversified indirect and long-term threats. Many countries have not established legal requirements in this frequency range, or they have introduced regulations based on recommendations regarding protection against direct thermal risks only (Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC). For such protection, the permissible levels of electric field intensity are 20-60 V/m (depending on the frequency). This work has been created through an interdisciplinary collaboration of engineers, biologists and doctors, who have been for many years professionally dealing with the protection of the biosphere against the negative effects of EMF. It presents the state of knowledge on the biological and health effects of the EMF emitted by mobile phone devices (including millimeter waves which are planned to be used in the Five G network). A comparison of the EU recommendations and the provisions on public protection being in force in Poland was made against this background. The results of research conducted to date on the biological effects of the EMF radiofrequency emitted by mobile telecommunication devices, operating with the frequencies up to 6 GHz, do not allow drawing any firm conclusions; however, the research evidence is strong enough for the World Health Organization to classify EMF as an environmental factor potentially carcinogenic to humans. At the moment, there is a shortage of adequate scientific data to assess the health effects of exposure to electromagnetic millimeter waves, which are planned to be used in the designed Five G devices. Nevertheless, due to the fact that there are data indicating the existence of biophysical mechanisms of the EMF influence that may lead to adverse health effects, it seems necessary to use the precautionary principle and the ALARA principle when creating environmental requirements for the construction and exploitation of the infrastructure of the planned Five G system.

I have written a lengthy document that goes through 16 areas of concern related to the rollout of 5G and overexposure to EMFs. The claim that there are only thermal effects from non-ionizing radiation is, simply put, not true at all. Despite what some say, there are in fact a couple of thousand peer-reviewed studies showing significant negative biological effects from exposure to non-ionizing EMFs. You can find links to 8 compilations of studies in the document. When I tried to post links, a longer text and use paragraphs my comment was flagged as spam (because of the settings of the channel owner) and didn&#39;t appear for others, so the solution was to post a link to the document in the description of the only video on my channel. Some of the topics / areas of concern: <br><br>An astounding lack of studies on the health effects of 5G, the studies that has been done show harmful effects - Thermal vs non-thermal effects, studies on EMF-effects on humans, insects, plants and animals - The two biggest studies to date show clear negative effects from exposure to EMFs - The current safety standards - Appeal from 250+ EMF-scientists - Oxidative Stress - Conflicts of interest and other major issues within the agencies that set the standards - Our sweat ducts and eyes may act as antennas for milli-meter waves - Brillouin precursor phenomena - Potential effects of EMF and millimeter-waves on the cell‚Äôs mitochondria - Push for AI integration and IOT - Security and privacy issues

How long we need suffering till 5G arrive in my country. <br><br>location ASIA.
Bro... i feel sick when using the 5G from this new iPhone 12 Pro Max. Even if people think that your health is safe it isn&#39;t.
I love your analogy of the 5g with the Samsung Galaxy. But is there any way you try the Nokia phone 5g to see if it will heat up like the Samsung. <br>Thank you
Pleas. Home. Intret
I m still using this s10 5g
Bruh he never said T Mobile but said sprint when T mobile owns sprint
When everything opens up, come to Mystic. Beers on me.
classic video
lol watching this in 2020 like the new Iphone 12 is 5G ready XD
I always mention this which has nothing to do with the topic. One if the latest trendy expressions is &quot;if you wanted to&quot;. And just like mist if the new additions to the English way of speaking, it is totally useless. Saying it does nit change the meaning if what you are saying in the slightest. So why are we making our language mire and more verbose  as part of the way we speak. Another one which really annoys me is &quot;go ahead&quot;, as in I will now go ahead and tell you something interesting. Why not just say, I will now tell you something interesting. I watch plenty of tutorials and demos and as soon as the person says one of those more than once, I stop watching. I just can&#39;t deal with the trend concept in general and when it comes to the language I speak, I draw the line. Interesting? Or am i just another nutbar looking for things to complain about? I think you make the best videos out there because you get to the point and explain so well. And you are not such a mr trendy. And without further ado, I will now go right ahead and say goodbye if I wanted to, but first and foremost, at the end of the day, I will go home like everyone else, if they wanted to.
Great video.even in late 2020.i really need 5g cause im late a yearüòÇ
DaaaaaaaamI feel primative I mexico we still have mb and 3g jaja
1 year ago mkbhd did a 5g-explained video 1 month ago mr.whose the bose did a 6g-explained video. THANKS
Wish my internet was even remotely as good as 4G
What about data cap? If you only have 5Gb per month, won‚Äôt that drain it instantly?
StarLink X - 5G -Covid 19 Vaccine have in common ?  more than you think
They can keep it then , lol üòÇ not paying 1200$ for a new phone üì≤
Oh.   Try 6G! :)
I have written a lengthy document listing 16 areas of concern related to the rollout of 5G. The claim that there are only thermal effects from non-ionizing radiation is, simply put, not true at all. Despite what some say, there are in fact at least a couple of thousands peer-reviewed studies showing very significant negative biological effects of non-ionizing RF-radiation. You can find links to the studies in the full document. When I tried to post links, a longer text and use paragraphs YouTube didn‚Äôt let my comment appear for others, so the solution was to post it in the description of the only video on my channel. You can find the document by clicking on my channel. Some of the topics / areas of concern: <br><br>An astounding lack of studies on the health effects of 5G, the studies that has been done show harmful effects - Thermal vs non-thermal effects, studies on EMF-effects on humans, insects, plants and animals - The two biggest studies to date show clear negative effects from exposure to EMFs - Appeal from 250+ EMF-scientists - Conflicts of interest and other major issues within the agencies that set the standards - Our sweat ducts and eyes act as antennas for 5G-radiation - Potential effects of EMF and millimeter-waves on the cell‚Äôs mitochondria - Push for AI - Security and privacy issues
The 2020 5g is dangerous
imo 5g is dumb. 4g lte is plenty fast for any task on a smartphone. just &quot;upgrading&quot; for the sake of it rather than it having any actual benefit.
the amount of times he said 5G is uncountable
even too much 4g is not healthy
&quot;One thousand, six hundred dollar phone-&quot;<br>No.
These 5th generation DOD tools SHOULD BE FREE. YALL PAYING FOR YOUR HOMICIDE WEAPON.
Really appreciated the neat explanation than other 5g videos out there.<br>Good job mkbhd
Watching this video with our fastest internet provider with 50kbps
Notice the birds chirping in the background close to the 5g antenna area
did anyone see the cut near his elbow
the intro was OPüòÇüòÇ
5g is a joke right now. This is still like 3-4 years out. Every building and light pole needs a 5g tower for this to even work and phone plans are going to be so expensive to pay for this!!! It will be the new thing but damn, phone plans are already expensive.
Waw very coll

my phone gonna be much faster than my pc internet well fuck
Since when does a flu virus affect the brain? researchers have warned that coronavirus could cause a significant long-term impact in brain function, with severe infections linked to a loss of brain function akin to ageing 10 years.¬†People who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits,‚Äù
For 5G to be viable, that poor area coverage needs to be dealt with.
Why not use 5G and optic fiber? 5G provides internet albeit the poor area coverage while optic fiber carries the 5G&#39;s data to your home at a long distance.<br><br>This idea came from a British farmer who built a 4G phone mast featuring a very long optic fiber cable under a long-ass trench.
How is this video made in 2019?<br>I thought 5G was made in 2020?

I dont think your point about microwaves is accurate. They have a longer wavelength than wifi.
This man really wants to argue that Android is better than apple. Just google it. Simple as that. Smh.
Musk, also cut from the same cloth as Gates and friends, has put with the aid of his Space X, 20 000 but, wants 42 000 5G satellites in low space orbit beaming 5G at the earth, been given permission to have one million ground-based 5G antennae in America, to create a worldwide grid system. Why is the common sense approach of making sure it&#39;s safe before any more roll out falling on deaf ears? Here it‚Äôs explained that it is deemed ESSENTIAL for the World Economic Forum&#39;s &#39;Great Reset&#39;, the UN&#39;s Agenda 2030, the WHO, Microsoft&#39;s Human Energy Mining/ cryptocurrency scheme, BigTech, tech dependent academics, the military industrial complex, all &#39;mainstream&#39; media etc. All leading to an AI world, transhumanism, and robots. Simply put, it is the ideal environment for machines, but a rubbish one for humans or living things. So no conspiracy theory - all facts easily checked and accessible info on &#39;mainstream&#39; internet sites. Can common-sense, good science and a deep compassion for all living things win against these forces? - absolutely. We all need to do our bit to counter such stupidity. ‚Äú26,000 doctors, scientists and health care providers worldwide who have recently issued appeals for URGENT ACTION on 5G to PROTECT public health calling for a HALT to 5G. We call for a SUSPENSION on 5G and any further wireless antenna densification until potential HAZARDS for HUMAN HEALTH, the ENVIRONMENT and CREATURES have been fully investigated by scientists independent from the wireless industry.‚Äù Millimetre-wave frequencies do affect the human body negatively, and the longer the exposure, the more damage that occurs. Since 5G uses millimetre waves and is set to push a constant barrage of frequency on humans anywhere they go, this would mean sustained wave exposure and thus inevitable biological damage. That should be a concern to all of us but, even though consciousness is awakening rapidly worldwide, how come nobody is protesting about 5G. The US Military‚Äôs microwave crowd control weapon called the ‚ÄúActive Denial System‚Äù. It disperses crowds by heating up their skins. This weapon operates using 95 GHz RF Radiation frequency. 5G can target an individual in a crowd, create flu-like symptoms or stop that person from absorbing oxygen (MIMO/Full Duplex/Beam Forming/60GHz), which will all be attached to the 5G network resulting in behavioural even thought control by AI or others, unable to gather in numbers to protest, the Ancient Death Cult has the perfect weapon to make society turn on anyone who refuses to get the nanotech-chipped-vaccine.
So Very True! Carriers Are Lying To The Masses About 5G Everywhere! It&#39;s Not And For A Very Long Time. As I&#39;m Typing This On 10/26/2020! 5G Is Not Even Closer To Reality! I Have T-Mobile. There&#39;s A 5G Tower 2 Blocks From My Home. Also A T- Mobile Store Just As Far From That Same Tower. I Always Go Into That Store And Play with Their 5G Phones. Not Once Has Their 5G Phones Delivered 5G Speeds!! Not Once! Damn Misleading Carriers! üíñüíï
To be honest I&#39;m still using 3G,  I just upgraded to An  Iphone 12 from an Iphone 8 Sprint to At&amp;T , So even if 5G doesn&#39;t work in some areas Id be Happy with 4G,

I saw that scar ouch
What about T-Mobile 5gÿü
I thought he lived out in California
what&#39;s the point of gigabit speed when the data is capped? Will I get one second of usage before it asks for a top up? lol
4g maybe slower  but I can receive the signal in almost any environment. 5g is a major scam.
All i need now is my own world were there are no bitches trying to kill me anyways or anything cause im tired asf;((
Just dont connect lmao thats scaryüôÇüíîüíî
Yo lo que quiero es que tumben el gobierno de venezuela, para que almenos tengamos un internet de 20mbps:(
Ya um, You threw some definite shade.
Thanks, Mr Browlee... you words about 5G mobiles made me order one from Amazon for ¬£299.00, the make I&#39;ve purchased is called realme X50, it is fantastic and said to go faster when all the network is 5G, but for nowadays it is as fast, if not faster than the Samsung and can do everything a Samsung mobile can do plus save you a few hundred in money... the network I am on is a very good network and is one of the cheapest ones out there... it is named &#39;3&#39;&#39; Three and it worked out to be ¬£8 per month for free minutes &amp; text plus 8GB per month.

Home internet is not even consistently touching 100mbps so I doubt mobile internet will be anytime soon
I mean how come were not talking about low and mid band 5G?
To hell with 5G!!  We don‚Äôt need it! Not worth the health risks!
My place globe sucks 4g only 2mbps
Hey if you have a iPhone XR or up, you should check out a app called RedTeaGo, you can get cellular data without needing a SIM card. You get get 1gb for free if you use promo code: FREE01GB
Thanks for the information
&quot;5G radios..&quot;  sounds like radiation,like increased...
you need to activate your 5G on your contract data plan or pay as you go...even if your 1200.99999 phone has it. i use it on my Samsung S10 5G for a year now...<br>it does drain your battery a bit faster...but you still need to download at all times for the phone to be hot, at least 10 mins ...not an issue.<br>...unless you do a hot spot for your computer. i do that to download large games,  and the phone drains while charging, not an issue tho..<br>it does work indoors...i have around 300--400Mbs 3 times faster than my wi-Fi<br>I have unlimited 5G data on my phone, so i&#39;ve done all these tests, it is a step up, and you don&#39;t have to live next to a pole. London tho :(
I can see spinning icon middle of the video while watching your video on G4.
I always appreciate the straight to the point and informative video style! Keep the content following...
5g is like having a regular old flip non smart phone on a 4g network,,,, what would be the point? Our phones don&#39;t have the battery or the tech but into them to make 5g viable, hell, to make it viable we probably need a whole new concept going away from the square slab!
Yaaay I will get 4g in the new year in Iraq, now I use 3g i want to die üê∏
T-Mobile&#39;s mid band 5G is something which will be a New normal.

Nice to hear the truth about 5G , thank you !
Many countries don&#39;t have full coverage of 4G yet!! So I&#39;d give 5G at least 13-15 years to be implemented on any useful scale in any country. Can only happen in certain cities with lots of money as some fancy tech gimmick to attract tourists and rich folks (I&#39;m looking at you Dubai), but I doubt it will be of any use to the general public in any near future.<br>Right now it&#39;s just used as a phone selling point because there&#39;s really nothing new to be added, totally useless and just pumps the price up.
Will the speed of Interest explorer Increase or not!??
What is the name of that app ur was using in the beginning and

Have you experience symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, poor memory, difficulty sleeping, and lack of clarity in your thoughts? It may seem that these could be the results of day-to-day stress and busyness, but there may be another culprit. All of these are symptoms of electro-sensitivity, which is something more and more people are finding themselves affected by. Studies done in 1997 have found ‚Äúless than a few cases (of electro-sensitivity) per million‚Äù, however now as much as 2.5% of the population find themselves affected by electro-sensitivity. Even by most moderate calculations, electro-sensitivity is 1,000 times more common now than it was 20 years ago. Why could this be?<br><br>Electro-sensitivity and its symptoms seem to be triggered by certain microwave frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. Microwaves are frequently used in electronics for the purposes of communication between devices. Due to their high frequency, microwaves allow for higher transmission rates and small antenna sizes, which is perfect for high-tech devices that are constantly getting smaller and faster. These are devices such as cell phones, tablets, laptops, and any devices able to connect to Wi-Fi, which can now include TVs and refrigerators. AiresTech products can help protect you from this, independently tested and functioning<br>You immediately notice the difference once you use them
Mrwhosetheboss be like: Pathetic, let me explain 6G
<b>Sees 5G tower</b><br><br><br><b>Destroys 5G tower to save the world</b> <br><br><br>&quot;I did it&quot; - Karen circa 2020
the 5 g will use a shorter frequency, and which says shorter frequency says less range ... It will be necessary to boost the signal by installing dozens of relay antennas aimed at us permanently (in addition to other electromagnetic fields already due to other devices such as TV, microwave, connected camera and so on ...)<br>And guess what? For the relay antennas the only standards which have been established, one was by the telephone operators not to create fires (and not for health and its preservation)<br>More than 230 scientists have already sounded the alarm on the 5 g as well as on the exposure to electromagnetic fields that we are currently experiencing. Experiments have even been carried out on living beings and the conclusions of his studies are not reassuring ... The precautionary principle is not even respected <br>And all these media with significant financial interests like TF1 belonging to Bouygues T√©l√©com (it&#39;s strange not?) Or subjected to pressure from lobbies like the states themselves, will never have the honesty not to jeopardize the health of billions of people ... But hey again it will be like the tobacco industry which has manipulated the scientific debate for decades and like the energy companies which derail climate policies and like those agrochemicals that falsify the effects of their pesticides on biodiversity and public health ... There are no conspiracies only lobbies and politicians preferring money to public health and the conservation of life and this is what will lead us to our own downfall ...
what about the ping ???!!!
Mrwhosetheboss: Lets talk about 6G!
Plz review the Samsung A series  (A20s).

YO WHAT U WENT TO MY CITY AND MY CITY HAS 5G I HAD NO CLUE THATS AMAZING AHHHH!!
I will stick to 4g for the rest of my life..
I have 7g cuz I live in norway
i dont kno how it is in the states, but when someone, a customer, is paying north of 100 bucks a month for &quot;high speed&quot; and its high speed numbers from 5 years ago, its just not good enough! give us what we expect and what we pay for or lower you god dam costs cell providers!

DoD already used up a big part of the 5G MMW frequencies (spectrum allocation for 5G), leaving less commercial use. The excerpt below explains why the U.S. is still struggling with 5G in terms of implementation. According to the National Security Implications of Fifth Generation (5G) Mobile Technologies document and excerpt to find out why the U.S. is still behind with 5G in building up capacity.<br><br>(&quot;The Department of Defense (DOD), however, holds large portions of the usable spectrum. Although DOD uses certain MMW frequencies for high-profile military applications such as Advanced Extremely High-Frequency satellites that provide assured global communications for U.S. forces, it extensively uses sub-6 frequencies‚Äîleaving less sub-6 availability in the United States than in other countries. The Defense Innovation Board (DIB) advised DOD to consider sharing sub-6 spectrum to facilitate the build-out of 5G networks and the development of 5G technologies used in the sub-6 band. While DOD has been moving toward greater spectrum sharing, it has expressed concern that sharing presents operational, interference, and security issues for DOD users. As an alternative to spectrum sharing, some analysts have argued that portions of the sub-6 spectrum should be reserved for commercial use. This would require DOD to relocate certain applications to other parts of the spectrum. The DIB estimates this approach would take around 10 years to complete, as opposed to 5 years for spectrum sharing.&quot;)
If a corporation or industry produces a product, then it has to be safe.  Ignore all the studies done by expert scientists in the field warning of the dangers.  Don&#39;t listen to people who claim this technology is used in the military&#39;s &quot;Active Denial&quot; Weapon system.  Ignore the warnings about use and abuse by governments with the new surveillance capabilities this gives them.  We can download movies and porn seconds faster. <br><br>Just for the record, can someone leave me a link or two on the long term safety studies done on this  new technology.  I&#39;m sure the scientists issuing the health warnings are aware of the sun but I want to download a movie 5 seconds faster so I&#39;m ignoring the scientists/Doctors and listening to the guy who has a youtube channel and whatever qualifications he might have.
Conclusion The fifth generation is an extension of the fourth generation Plus, and whoever controls this technology owns the world in the future
I present a hypothesis: Increasing radio waves (e.g. 5G) cause e.g. loss<br> of porpoises, whale beaching, tinnitus, global warming, pacemaker <br>disturbances. Maybe cancer too.

R. I. P üê¶
Wicked video mate!!! Greetings from Rio de Janeiro.
The guys that leave in front of that 5G tower are living the live I‚Äôve ever dreamed
I have 5G in my area my tower goes up to 700 . They put one big tower to cover up most of the aera
The higher the internet speed goes, the higher the standard resolution of videos, the size of video games will go. Everything will still suck for the middle class people.
in germany we have the same problem withe the switching but in germany we switch between 4g and 3g
1600 $ for Samsung phone ?? Wtf !!!!
What I notice is why is camera cutout on S10 5g soo big compared to normal s10 Plus
Who else is watching this on 5g
What happend? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTUs_2hq6Y&amp;t=446">7:26</a> your right arm? Man take care of yourself.
ok nice i could use up my data space within 4 seconds
no man i seriously have that t-shirrt
The start is faster than what my brain reacted
As I understand it Wuhan China had the kind of 5G installation that you were suggesting . Also about 3 months previous they had all received a mandatory flu vaccine . So when the day came to flip the switch people started to get sick and those that had prior medical conditions were needing immediate attention . At a certain point people were dying in the street . Some 21 million plus  smart phone users did not renew their service contracts leaving people to believe that they may have died from the covid virus ?
That intro tho
The intro is the best intro ever
damn 5G is crazy dont know when it will get to kenya but that galaxy s10 do you mind blessing me with it

Waiting for 5G is like waiting for google fiber....ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTUs_2hq6Y&amp;t=446">7:26</a> how you hurt your hand
Bro my city doesn&#39;t have proper 4G yet, the best I can get from my house is H+
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTUs_2hq6Y&amp;t=445">7:25</a><br> you see what 5G did to his arm
Hey what&#39;s up guys I&#39;m could be a she here, so... üòÇ
Nuts to that... What else ya got?
I live in SoCal and I just dumped boost mobile and switched to T-Mobile due to their 600mhz 5g implementation and their $100 4 line essential plan (I have 5 lines) which includes 5g and then I bought a new Oneplus 7T Pro McLaren edition phone from last year on Ebay for $550 and I gotta say I like the move I been testing the 5g all over SoCal as I drive all over as a Canon tech and I have been getting constant 5g with very few cases were it drops to 4g so I am pleased so far.
You are not switching between towers faster, but more frequently. Or, if you wish, sooner.
India me aaj bhi  2G speed hai to üíîüíî
you would be quite astonished to hear that I am from India an I have a 100Mbps fibre optic connection with no FUP at my home paying as little as 1000/- or 13.47 USD.. Its not that stable though because local operators usually turn of media converters as soon as a single bolt of lightning is heard.. But i am sure you can pay those off with like extra 15 USD/Month.. You can have a gigabit at home for 3700/- or 50$/month.. Crazy isn&#39;t it??.. and it is the norm at cities in india....
In other news if your vegan get a vitamix if your not still get one fuck em they are legendary I have one I paid for it also and have seen first hand proof of why the price is justifiable and the performance and so on is insane
If you really think 5g will kill you then guys I&#39;m sorry but your all dumb asses as a microwave will emit more radiation than 5g
5g is gonna take time and mostly the first customers are going to shell out more money than the rest !
Holy Shit!
How are simultaneously living in a world where 2gb is a data cap and Warzone is doing 60gb PATCHES
Hahha
Wouldn‚Äôt this be a good way for the govt. or  police investigators to ping exactly where you are or have been?

Always be thankful for what you have..

why not use put wifi routers in every corners then to create a 5g network, and all phone already has wifi so no need to buy expensive phone, call can also happen on wifi...
5g sounds like worlds biggest gimmick to sell expensive phones ....
what is the speed when gaming with 5g ?
Have the govt gobble up the vhf and uhf frequencies and allocate them to 5g.
I started coughing and almost choked when I saw the speed test in the beginning
normal people doesnt need for more than 4G....
Lol I got a Linus pulseway ad before this video
How about the US fire department banning them any where near because in one case all FD staff had abnormal deficiencies and kids getting cancer. In ply grounds where the antennas are. ITS DUSGUSTING G5 IS PRIMARILY A WEAPON TO ATTACK ARMIES N CROUDS DO YOUR RESEARCH MATE
Imagine if by the time they install the 5g towers 6g comes out
I don&#39;t think we shall ever have this in Uganda..... 3G is still a problem
After a long wait, my carrier is finally bringing 5G to Denver. My service has been slow for a couple of weeks and it should be done soon.

5G is to benefit manufacture and not public except more high speed data that we will pay for, Manufactures already developing 6G and public need to make choice high speed data or your health and life. 5G transmission is almost line of sight direct transmission where radio wave is focused and directed to user and distance limited due to its high frequency transmission. . Means in high density environment such a city buildings are obstacles that require hundreds and thousand of new 5G transmitters and antenna to assure strong signal strength at any location and  99% coverage to meet at least 3G or 4G standard. The higher is transmission frequency and close to X-ray  the more dangerous is to human flesh in causing cancer and blood disorders. There are many medical evidences when human body exposed to continuous high frequency radiation even at small levels brain cancers and blood disorders develop.
5G is great!  But available at my home only.  ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

What about latency in 5G networks?<br>What is the real &quot;ping&quot;?
Can you test now 5g with coming smartphone in 2020.
Maybe 5GE means 5G Error?
Why my, 4G is PERFECT. Yes i&#39;m in Bulgaria,and we have one of the fastest internet in the world. Why in this poor shity ,country(500$ is a good monthly salary LOL)-luck and coincident.<br> With my 4G i watch,play and  download with all most home Wi-Fi speed .I never need better . How much,what unit -don&#39;t have fucking idea.

You‚Äôre comment on 5GE with AT&amp;T is hilarious. Because I have AT&amp;T with a 4G iPhone 8 and saw 5GE multiple times in a few places. And thought I had 5G. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
5g is genocide, look it up, its harmful to the human body
God now I don‚Äôt like atnt

you dont know anything about 5G you just love the speed of it you never think about cancer
5g is SO F,,,,ING FLAKEY
MKBHD YT videos plays in HD n all that super stuff and is sayin upload speed could hv been better <br>Me watching videos at 144p XD and when a movie downloads 5 days remaining XD<br>JK XD
How many GB&#39;s will need for an average user per month? Does 5G mobiles consume more data than 4G? Please advice. Thanks.
This guy just won&#39;t compromise with his video quality. <br><br>He appends the sponsored footage right after completing his full video !  ‚ù§<br><br>Will definitely meet you once in my life, MKBHD. Love you bro.

And Philippines Telco companies are investing in 5g even though their main problems are the few number of cell sites they have. Idiots
Now all i have to do is wait a few hundred years for it to come to my town...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>ARe wE thEre yeT

Its forgery
What if each one of our 5G phones becomes the antenna itself?<br>We would drastically speed up the coverage process of all those nodes.<br>I&#39;ve been dreaming about this all my life, a phone with a better connection shares to another phone nearby.<br>We just have to make blockchain stuff a new normal so we can finally stop being paranoid about all the privacy concerns from a centralized system. <br>Hurra! decentralization of the internet shared by our own phones. <br>access for everybody
dna is collected tru C0vid &quot;tests&quot;<br> @
the higher the frequency the quicker you cook, awesome
Imagine if the cost of blanketing these 5g nodes in every nook of communities was instead spent on directly improving people‚Äôs lives... helping them afford medial care, education, etc...
check his right arm at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTUs_2hq6Y&amp;t=445">7:25</a>
The 5G nodes are going to have to be incorporated into street lights, maybe even the cameras. They will have to be ubiquitous to be effective.

Wait did this video have 3D audio or is it just me
You people really need to wake up some MAN MADE things just weren&#39;t meant to be. I will not get a new upgraded cell phone that&#39;s why I have a cheap phone. Just like global warming is yr. Man is gonna destroy man kind!! Go somewhere in your home that has a solid concrete room and see how your phone won&#39;t get a single as well as it would in the open. Too whom it may concern!!;if there&#39;s someone who feels the same way I do and has the money and resources for a group of people like myself get together and prepare yourself for what&#39;s about to come sign me up I&#39;ll be on the front line protecting our love ones like my grandchildren who are young and were born in this evil world that&#39;s all about money. I have started buying bullet proof vest along with plenty of ammo and if I had the finance to build some type of under ground fall out shelter stocked with veggies seeds along with many other dry goods. So sign me up for this and I will die protecting my loved ones as well as yours who ever wants to organize something I&#39;M READY TO PROTECT MINES AND YOURS
i have 5g
Hi, also the number of 5G users on the cell will make coverage decrease because of the mobile noise generated.
STOP 5g!!!!!!!!!! IT WILL KILL US!!!!!! NO VACCINE!!!!!!
hello guys i wanna how about pc? does it require to be a 5g computer or you only need a 5g wifi?
I think there is gonna be a huge crowd near 5g nodes.

ther s an investigation around 4g and 5g..got to do with infrared frequency..which is th core of ALL our tecnological devices..this is th dangerous stuff...even more than petrol..cause petrol wirhin  our range of handling..but waves , and their vibration..noise..low frequency...affect our cells...they act like music which th body hears...we literally slumber...feel more sleepy..tired..and dont know why...this ia basicly th problem...with 5g...which makes it a more efficient device of channeling infrared frequency....we r doomed..anyone s willing to exist wirhout mobile?<br>unless we work out our pineal gland and become telepathic..superhuman...<br>well..its possible....just tht we need to b a network...we dont like to stay isolated..l d rather die together

Great description - thanks  <br>Glass does not stop microwaves - the mexh in the glass does , holes smaller then wave length
Very well produced, explained at the right level of detail. Good job keep it up!.
Heyyy, even we made a video about what 5G is and what it can do. It is a well-Explained video. Please do check it out !!!
But, what about going out into the suburbs or on the open highway?  Suburbs and open highways, even country roads, do not have poles every 3 or 5 feet hundred apart to have a 5G node. So for now, the 5 G phone is good only for the urban and city use.  So you can&#39;t use the 5 G phone on a train, plane, boat, or a car on the road.  Certainly commercial truckers won&#39;t be able to use it.
is there any reason google/youtube/facebook/ or any other major social media platform on earth had removed all blogs/clips/etc.. that are linking/connecting 5G to corona ?

People should have watched this video before doing all sorts of things.
thing is the jump from 3 to 4 G was a big jump and i find 4G is more than enough speed for a handheld device?<br><br>it just seems like alot of money and effort for just speed.<br><br>so why do we need 5G?
el morenazo de fuego
I really enjoyed this lesson as I had no idea of why 5g is the future.
this might be a noob comment, but are the nodes wireless or are they connected to some fiber optic wire?  portable 5g nodes? if they are not grounded
Thats very stupid
Well they didn&#39;t spy Trump wanted to have it first
Great content and explanation, thankyou

Watch for South Korea for what 5G is going to deliver. They already found a way to make it cover through  buildings and rains. The county is moving towards producing products and services only possible under 5G.
5G like 4G and 3G will keep depleting oxygen from our Atmosphere leaving all humans susceptible to Viruses like Coronavirus.
Did you check the Radiation levels at the same time or even the Frequency levels ?<br>Both of which are damaging to your DNA and Cell structure hence the name CELL PHONE. <br>Everything on Earth has a natural frequency so as  Technologies use unnatural frequencies there will be problems especially to the Brain.<br>Cancers went into overdrive at the same level of Technology implimentation into our Communities. <br>Please do some research before advocating the advertising of 5G.

I‚Äôd probably won‚Äôt need it ever I‚Äôm perfectly satisfied with 4g<br>By the way we don‚Äôt have aerial electrical cables like these in developed world anymore your infrastructure sucks
This comment section is really being   censored when you try to post information and links that contradict what we&#39;re being told/sold.   Shadow  banning or outright deletion of comments.  Whatever your feeling about 5G, censorship is a dangerous thing.

Combined with chemtrails sprayed in the atmosfear it can depopulate the earth. With heavy metals injected in the blood it will be even more effective.
Useless. unless you have an urgent need for speed.

who else noticed the injury close to his elbow?
I think people are only concerned about speed when it comes to 5G but its not only that. <br>4G, 5G ==== Highway<br>Internet Plan === Your Car<br>Bandwidth/Speed ==== Your Car Top Speed<br>So even though your car can hit 1Gb per second, it does not matter when there is traffic jam. Your request/response time with the server will be terrible.<br>So with 5G they are also trying to make the highway so big that many concurrent vehicles can  just travel in consistent speed without getting into the traffic jam.<br>To give you an example,<br>Think about the in game pings you have on multiplayer games, <br>Although you have pretty good bandwidth, you suffer bad ping if you are far from the game server, No matter what top speed your car has,  You won&#39;t be getting from your home --&gt; server --&gt;  home any faster.
I&#39;m waiting till T-Mobile 5G is better before I get a 5G phone.
cant wait for 50G and even 500G
Expert Review üíûü§ó
What would mobile providers be saying in the future? Unlimited texts, unlimited calls, and unlimited data? I&#39;m excited.
I don&#39;t know how it sounds<br>But....<br>...<br>...<br> ..<br>...<br>...<br>Because of being a kashmiri I m watching this vedio at 2G speed..GOD help us...
5G is speed less i can&#39;t what to used 5G network because the hype is too much
what happened to your right-hand elbow?<br>did you got injured somehow?
Thank you for the explanation, but I&#39;m still missing a point. What is the point of 5G? Yes, it&#39;s great to have a ludicrously fast connection, but....do you really need it? Let me explain: Most of us, use connectivity to read email, use social networks, watch videos, chat, read news and other stuff on the internet. To do all of this, the 4G network proved to be more than enough. The only real noticeable advantage of the 5G is when one has to download a (relatively) large file or is a gamer. While the former can be an extremely useful feature , the latter is kinda detrimental. Why would one go outside to play a video game instead of doing it in the comfort of his own house (Or the house of friend)? Seriously: What is the point of going to a pub, sit down in a corner and vegetate for hours?
Your 4g upload speed is faster than my home fibre optic broadband download speed. Great.
I love the first clip.
In my country India its govt. Carrier BSNL just got 4g..... My country will get 5g when usa gets 7g
Him at 5G or His internet: 2.1K mbps/ internet 60mbps<br><br>Me: having no 5G, but internet : 2 mbps
Brother, 5G is a toxic frequency to living tissue; straight up deadly. The dangers and cons of 5G are extremely serious. We really need to stop this from happening. It kills life forms. Microwaves don‚Äôt come out of the microwave because of the glass and box they‚Äôre semi contained in. If they weren‚Äôt they damage living tissue too. Please, keep your humanity?
Anyone else spotted the sore near his elbow? Or was that just me? Hope your arm gets better soon. What happened?
IT BROUGHT US THE CORONA VIRUS, NO NEED FOR ANY OTHER EXPLENATION!!
Wait, in your country has 5G? UNBELIEVABLE....<br><br>Sadly, In Indonesia still not come true this fastest network ever...<br><br>Hopefully, In Indonesia will come true this fastest network....
You are a great Youtuber. Love your vids content and how you deliver the info.  Please keep the good work and thanks for the video.
hopefully by 2025 we will have secure and affordable 5G..
that intro is so fake
Does anyone know when UK will get properly working 4g?
A little more and the buildings from city  will colapse from so much G Antenas
I find it funny that people complain about Apple not putting out a 5G phone yet.  5G sounds great on paper...but its just not there, so why spend the money to put in a 5G modem in a phone when its really not truly ready for everyone to take advantage of.
They‚Äôre going to turn the towers on in October and it‚Äôs going to cause the Atoms in oxygen to spin and will suffocate ppl.. then they‚Äôll blame it on Corona.. this is coming from a higher source.. STAY WOKE PPL .
it&#39;s better to use 4g on a 5g phone. maybe when 6g comes we&#39;ll use 5g :D
ME; HOLY COW, 5G<br>after this...<br>imma stick to ADSL <br>:)<br>JJ ;)
Doesn&#39;t MKBHD have a Galsxy S20 5G? Why buy a new phone that&#39;s compatible with 5G when he already has one?
We already good
The higher the frequency.. the more it‚Äôs gone kill
Because everytime some new comes out, they make you get the new, by slowing down the other one..
Y‚Äôall gone die so badly.. it‚Äôs gone catch more bodies then drugs, more than anything
Thank you for the explanation !
Where my 3g gang at ?
Our wifi has 100mbps up and down speed.
Starting was really amazing marques üëåüëå
Imperial Democracy-Small groups of business elites control governance<br> direct democracy(democracy with a small d)-Democratically elected governance controls business and economic activity<br> Representative Democracy-Clear separation between governance and <br>business/economic activity. Government has no business being involved in<br> business. Business has no business legislating and regulating the <br>protection of staff, associates,consumers, and neighboring people from <br>fraud and physical harm. That is the solely the responsibility of the three branches of government. <br><br> Currently the Federal Communication Commission has outsourced the <br>testing of 5G to industry &quot;experts&quot;. This is totally unacceptable as it <br>is corrupt and dysfunctional. 5G MUST BE OPPOSED AND NOT ALLOWED TO BE <br>DEPLOYED. IF BOXES ARE CURRENTLY INSTALLED,THEY MUST BE TAKEN DOWN <br>IMMEDIATELY!
Wifi at home is still better.
me sitting here with my 3g iphone 8...
Very informational.  Thanks!
What the hell happened to your arm!??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTUs_2hq6Y&amp;t=445">7:25</a> what happened to your hand?!
The thing about the microwave is actually wrong. The physical thing is that the microwave has a eletromagnect chamber that doesn&#39;t allow the waves to go trough the metal plates and the &quot;glass&quot;. On the front you has this grill that works to, because his holes are never to big for the lang of the eletromagnect wave. That is why you should never drill a hole on it and you shouldn&#39;t use too old microwaves because probably has some. The physical concept is called Faraday Cage.<br>And the real reason of those frequencies not going to far is because the higher is his value, more energy you would spend to produce a bright spot. And a good exemple for that is thinking of why blue laser are soo powerfull and the red ones aren&#39;t.<br>Apologies for my english. I&#39;m not a native speaker.
5G will help you to Download your conspiracy theories faster ü§´
5G made my foreskin fall off
So I‚Äôm really confused... I really don‚Äôt see the hype with 5G on phones, I can do everything I want to do on 4G so what will it do different / better? I thought the whole point of 5G was for IoT and fully automated cars???
i have 5G its really good when your near it but its God Damn useless when you&#39;re not
my wifi only have 250 mbps down and 20 mbps up
5G travels just as far as any other wave length, only difference is that data integrity degrades much faster and at much shorter distances as the high frequency waves are less stable over the long distance.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTUs_2hq6Y&amp;t=446">7:26</a> did someone notice the elbow
Joe biden and the chairman of china met with inter dimensional space demons and werewolves to discuss 5G and how to cover it up with a big story about coronavirus
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTUs_2hq6Y&amp;t=244">4:04</a> That‚Äôs paint ...right?
U phone works just as fast....
No lie, I just got new wifi and i was so gassed that it was doing 5mg per second.
Go thank South Korea. They invented it first.

It&#39;s interesting how he skipped the whole bit about the danger of high frequency radiation possibly altering your DNA...but thats OK he got a big paycheck no doubt
Yes please help progress the radioactive waves that essentially melt out brains, So you can download Fortnite faster.
lmmfaoo how much did they pay you to promote this bullshit to your 11million sleep subscribers your even sleep yourself! Since the world isn‚Äôt going mad fast enough they are gonna kill us all with radiation because every idiot wants the latest and greatest technology! 5G IS GONNA KILL US WITH ITS RADIATION ASSHOLES!!!!
Marques: ‚Äúmore capable than the previous, some of you may remember the old and very slow 2G and 3G and how much better is 4G than those...‚Äù<br><br>Me with a 3G phone: ‚Äúüòî‚Äù
5g is a war weapon<br>It releases gamma Ray what&#39;s in a nuclear weapon
In India, Jio will give us 5G but with the speed of actual 4G.<br>.<br>Just the same as their pathetic 4G speed is, same to actual 3G.
The last minute sounded so impressive from him. Remote surgery?? 5G truly is a modern marvel.<br>Now also imagine the effect on the porn websites :D
I wish he would have touched on the potential cancer causing effects of 5g. It&#39;s already known cellphones cause cancers and at any given point have 4 different radio waves (bluetooth, wifi, cellular and GPS) being emitted.
What happened  to your right  hand blow the elbow üê∂
Whoever lives in that brick house is a lucky bast turd
Well explained Marques üëç<br>Quite investment infrastructure to get 5G working properly.<br>Wait till 10G !
in my opinion, 5G is NOT worth it... i don&#39;t think that building those towers everywhere is future.. i think that we will just have to wait for something more efficient.. i mean.. for kind of special use, 5G is fine, but for now in my opinion, people won&#39;t use it and it&#39;s just not economically worth it.. It&#39;s cool that you can watch youtube videos &quot;faster&quot;, but using 4G, you can watch 4K video on your phone without any lag on youtube . it&#39;s just way too expensive and it will be massive fail in my opinion. People will be able to download faster, but theoretically, why? why would you need to download? all things could be stored ONLINE and the access would be instant. covering whole world with 4G is just more practical. few places can be 5G but to cover the towns with 5G to theoretically DOWNLOAD faster, i don&#39;t see future in that.. i see future in streaming, not downloading.<br>long story short for me, most people won&#39;t be using the 5G&#39;s full potential and so 5G will fail.. <br>I would like to discuss about this topic so if somebody would like to, it would be pleasure for me.
5g aka 56.   56/65  56 is a very common number.   This is interesting because of this pandemic we&#39;re having.  I have heard tons of rumors about 5 g and this is phase 2 of 9/11.   The govt wants to really see what everyone is doing.
What were the power densities hitting you when you did this testing?

Isn&#39;t 5G dangerous
the truth is much more baZzar than the lie ..<br>so much so that it hides itself...<br>when exposed to the light of day <br>often rejected ridiculed .. crucified<br>mankind is a puffed up selfserving myopic creature
A &quot;virus&quot; does not kill. The virus is a defensive response of the body. <br>But if the body keeps being bombarded with harmful radiation <br>(most of it microwaves, in our time) then the body will keep killing the <br>damaged cells. That is the Godgiven mission of a &quot;virus&quot;: to kill cells <br>with damaged DNA. Why? Because otherwise the bad cells would divide and <br>multiply, with their harmful DNA. This is probably one of the causes of <br>tumors. This is also the problem with vaccines in general: They force your <br>body to produce antibodies before the &quot;virus&quot; has done its benificial <br>job with eliminating defective cells<br>.................<br>A &quot;virus&quot; is produced by your own body to 1) repair cells and 2) kill cells <br>with damaged DNA. The &quot;far worse&quot; thing that&#39;s coming is the chip injected <br>with vaccines. But before that, they will keep using 4G towers to make you <br>body produce &quot;viruses&quot;, and 5G to commit mass murder. <br>.......................<br>Follow the money. Wuhan virus ablates Inner Cities <br>(slums), homeless, illegals; generic Browns, Blacks, <br>Muslims, geriatrics. <br>Wuhan virus is a demographic rebalancing long term <br>fiscal thing ‚Äì Hitler‚Äôs camps without the carbon <br>footprint and opprobrium. Just saying‚Ä¶.<br>.....................<br>This is our Chernobyl ....
5G towers cause coronavirus lol can&#39;t believe all the people saying that stupid shit.
How are people so stupid
I remember Verizon 2x
so all that time i had EE 5G its only been 4G thats dam right crazy my apps take seconds to download does me like i only have alcatel 5.7&quot; 64 G phone and paid 60 pounds for it and its never let me down i dont see all the fuss of buying expensive phones probley have more chance of getting 5G in space haha
Dude what happened to your elbow
You can play on asian servers with 1 ping!
Who else looked at the top left of their screen and saw AT&amp;T 5Ge while Marques said it‚Äôs 4G
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTUs_2hq6Y&amp;t=138">2:18</a> lol
A friend of mine actually working with 5G said this video is full of nonsense.<br>Disappointed, was a follower for many years.
i have to say this guy has no facial emotions. Even when he tries to express a facial expression its a failure lol. Keep up the good work though, nice video.
yo wtf anyone else randomly having Arabic captions or just me?
5G is kinda awesome. I don&#39;t think the government is watching us though haha
The only real real use for 5G I see right now is for gaming and video streaming, everything else I can do it nicely with 4G,
The whole world is in lockdown yet we MUST install these. Priorities.
you mean caronavirus explained
Man the amount of people who don&#39;t know this can&#39;t kill you is just weird because I learned about light and different types of waves in eight grade and even I know 5g is such a low wave there isn&#39;t a possible way it can harm you and I don&#39;t want your dumb articles I trust in science
Title of the video - 5G explained.<br>Me watching the video at 144p cause of a shitty speed.
Imagine using 5g on a limited data plan just to accidentally watch a 10 youtube hour video
5G E should have been 5G J<br><br>J for joke!!
Just think  a movie downloading in 1gbs ...<br><br><br><br>. But the movie is 3TB....(Future times)
Just imagine how good of a life the people living in the brick home next to the 5G Cell Tower are having
There must have been a lot of backlash about the telegraph as well.
One right outside my house , I can see through my windowüòå
You call this an engineering explanation ? This is such  elementary  knowledge  and an insult to anyone informed on data transmissions . Of course it is all about speed  . The question is what can be achieved with this technology . Well just look at what the Chinese do to ¬± one million plus people of their population which  do not subscribe to their communist thinking. They are locked in a city and every individual is monitored  by things like facial recognition and a hoard of other things . Part of the Agenda 21 project of the UN in conjunction with the Bill Gates of this world  and a Covid-19 vaccine to give everyone a Covid  passport which will allow you to travel ., and think of what else could be done by  NWO with this technology  like giving you access to your bank  etc etc The whole program is to be rolled out by 2030 .

Mobile phone radiation is dangerous for you now. 5G will be a whole lot worse. It‚Äôs advised not to carry a phone on you next to your body such as in your back pocket.
Which phone you use bro
I remember the time when having GPRS was cool.
I have the note 10 5g and it says 5ge

It would be be cool and easier if they did it in collabration with star link
Genrally, for phone usage, you don&#39;t even need 5G. How often are you really need that amount of speed? Pretty much never. You wonna play movie? Possible with 4G, wonna play game? Same thing. You need a too big file for 4G? Grab a coffee and done.
Next thing you know Karens are going to say that Oxygen is killing us.
I clicked on this video to find any moronic Karens in the comments.
more towers=more tracking and loss of privacy
5G is only dangerous if you snort it all at once :-)

Good break down...
5G could make Stadia into more than just a laughing stock!
Scientifically seeing, I feel 5G would most probably become a Failure.
Hang on this man is healthy. Does this mean that 5g doesnt cause corona?? oh man! Someone tell those conspiracy theorists they&#39;re claim has been disproven lmao
5G is also about the low latency, think about all the real time use cases in industrial env.
Thanks for your input. It really helped making a decision!
Sweet video
Really great use of 5G: Explained

U are great
I can&#39;t wait to see the introduction of 10G though COVID-30
That the microwave doesn‚Äôt heat anything up on the outside is because of the metal grid! Not the distance!
U could just use screen recorder i mean its easier and much much easier to see lol
Really fast connection speed so we can quickly get to things and that we are gonna waste endless hours of our life on.
I&#39;ve been on lte+ forever... never had access to 3g or 4g... I would truly love access to a 5g network.
That introduction though
need 5G sim card <br>shit
Hhyg
nah that is just minecraft shades with realistic texture
Interesting that you are not talking about health issues concerning 5 G. 5 G is not good for living organism but is great for robots or machines. You could almost make a video on health issues ... Don&#39;t neglet health issues ...

What about the environmental effects? What is the effect of the emission of very high frequency waves on the environment?
5g made my wife cheat on me. This needs to be stopped.
you are the one
lol the end of video buffering all together? Get ready for 64k video my dude. It&#39;ll buffer like you&#39;ve never seen before.
hello MKBHD my broadband plan is 20mbps but only 2.5mbps is getting what can i do to get 20mbps hope you reply im from kerala im a big fan of yours
people on 2020: OMGG<br><br>me: hehe boi get ready to kill your battery : )
Fucking puppet to the government and sadly people believe in this propaganda video just because someone made a video. 5g is dangerous and all the symptoms of fever come from this 5g still can travel through walls and obstacles
He is talking about 5G when my country only has 3G lmao..
ugh time to build a hut there
I had remember ages ago   I happened to get inside the service center of Samsung for a service of my Galaxy S4 due to too much heat , it burns and failed. I notice a lots of pillars of little white boxes as highas 1 meter. I notice as well one of it is slightly opened and had a label on it saying as S4 main MB. I was asking the service techncian why it took them 3 months before they have my 3rd replacement and they said that they were still waiting for the parts to arrive. Then I told him about those white boxes over there, why not we can have one of those. He replied, those are defectives same as what happened to mine. Beleive me or not, I  had burned 3 Brand new Samsung S4 before I gave up doing a 4G download for my TORRENT since I had an UNLIMITED subscription that time. Now let us see if a TITANIUM MATERIAL S10 could survive the effect of a GIGABYTE data flow. I had as well burned killed a lot of HD and SSD... No one believes me that speed kills not just in physics.
I will not buy 5g phone until my huawei p30 pro  ruins
Great explanation with real time experiments.<br>Thanks üôè brother.
Without 5 g there is no network only dialing wrong phone.
caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanccccerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
For most people 5g won&#39;t be that important at the moment. I&#39;ve even had what was called LTE+ on my galaxy s9 with speeds that hit 150mbps down. I use my phone very often and do not benefit from speeds higher than even 50mbps. I can see this being more important in the future and building the infrastructure now is important, but for most people high end LTE is enough
