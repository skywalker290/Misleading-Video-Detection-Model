Srk👑
The way SRK conducts himself man... amazing. Love him.
@
Rajeev you are a decent guy 🙏🙏 respect
Can listen to him for hours
Okay, I&#39;m going down a Rajeev Masand interview-binge. And man, what an amazing journalist. He is so thoughtful, he researches his guests so thoroughly. He asks insightful questions which draws out the best answer.  I am so impressed with his ability to remember the details of his subjects.  It is a gift to be able to let others shine.  Props to Rajeev!!!
King Khan SrK 🔥❤️
Still indian movies are way back to the European cinema....i saw nomad life..what a movie...I don&#39;t think bollywood could like to make a movie like nomadlife
Irish man is a amazing movie....
I love youuuuuuuuuu ❤️🥺🌍😭
Listening to SRK speech can definitely  improve your spoken english class. Oh my god. What an actor he is......
My god . What a speech. He is the most intelligent actor bolywood have ever seen.
Shah Rukh Khan is the wisest. His aura, his presence, his personality 🔥🔥. He&#39;s the best spokesperson. He talks with such depth, can listen to him all day everyday. He&#39;s got the wit, the humour, intelligence, charisma.<br>He&#39;s not only a phenomenal actor but a great great human being.<br>A total charmer. Love him to infinite ❤❤<br>God bless him
Shahrukhi. I love you 🙊
Love srk
He leaves a healing effect on us.
extremist is a bad adjective to use..
This man lost everything in young age family mom dad his sister got depression then started his career by Seriel Bollywood debut by other rejected movies he never give up life true inspiration shahrukh khan sir😞
Still waiting for an announcement😭
THE LAST OF THE STARS ❤ <br>Can&#39;t wait to see THE 🤴👑 on big screen.
SRk we love you so much and so happy to see you
SRK is a good father. Despite being the most popular actor, he doesn&#39;t let his kids find the easy route to success. Instead he has made them go to college and take degrees regarding the subject or field they are interested in.
Can we get more content regarding writing?
His gift of speaking is so smooth and perfect. Whether he gives hit or flop , it doesnt matter .
Love you srk 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Very true, whenever i need a good cry i watch a hindi movie lol its good for the system.
Love you srk 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
MASHA ALLAH. MUBARAK. CONGRATULATIONS. KHAIR. MIYA MIYA. ASSALAMU ALAIKUM EVERYONE
In every shahrukh khan interview it&#39;s not just the audience that is spell bound by his intelligence, charm Nd just the way he conducts himself.. but also the interviewer ... They don&#39;t talk much and let him express his thoughts...
Shahrukh khan made a lot of mistakes chose wrong films. He needs to relinquish control and trust directors and stop changing stories to suit his superstar needs. Also the days of superstars is over.  The audience has changed.
Shah Rukh Khan. I love your wit. (Apart from your acting)
Srk playing Ironman would be gold
Love you srk 💚💬💚💛💬💛💙💬💙❤💬❤💜💬💜💖💬💖🧡💬🧡🖤💬🖤
Bahoot bahetrin badiyaa khan sb. All the best......fantastic

Gosh. He is looking thin... ?
Two movies i love of SRK&#39;s... Chak De and Veer Zaara.... i love his art of speaking  but as an actor, he is one of the highly overrated actors on the planet earth. I love him but there are so many brilliant actors  way ahead of him in South,Bollywood and other parts.
SRK plz take our ❤ from Bangladesh

Ideal persons to be inspiration.
I love you Shah Rukh Khan
This guy is prolly the most intellectual actor to have ever been. He is honest, doesn&#39;t run away from failures and accepts them.
SRK IS OLDER THAN THIS OLD LOOKING INTERVIEWER
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=517">8:37</a> he says he&#39;s working with Netflix for another series??🤔I hope he&#39;s starring in it.
Thank you SRK for shouting out Trinidad &amp; Tobago 🇹🇹 we love you
The game of &quot;nepotism&quot; is now dripping down on the ground now more than ever! I&#39;d say on an incredibly extended degree..
Love from pakistan

SRK speaks so well. He is balanced and poised in his speech. He speaks with effortless ease. His thoughts are very clear, so he can speak like that. He knows what he is saying, and knows exactly how to say it, and when.
By shortage for steady interviewers so get da chance for sweet seller 😄😃😀😍

He has been respected throughout the world despite going through a bad phase....
I don&#39;t understand from where he gets so much positivity around him listening to him is just pure

We should learn from srk on how to handle our failures
Shah Rukh is a frustrated peraon
Love you king khan
SRK is soo ugly now!
Lot to be learn from him
Love you king Khan
Good interviewer, but he shakes his head too much. Be patient and natural, let the conversation flow like water.
I am not Indian, and I discovered this wonderful artist 6 months ago and have seen almost all his films where he has a leading role, and have enjoyed every single one. Some were very good, some were very sweet and wonderful and some were just great! I wish he would do an action packed, police, spy or political thriller, a character trying to uncover a conspiracy, a wrong doing, and if it also has elements of romance, it will be the icing on the cake! I remember One 2 K 4 where he gave a wonderful performance, especially in the intense and frantic moments when he was trying to uncover evidence of his frame-up and the murder of his partner! Always looking forward to his next films!
👍🏻......❤
M&#39;i only one who come here to learn english. 😀
His interviews are so intelligent &lt;3
7.40 the way shahrukh reacted was too funny 😂 he had too much coffee I guess
This guy brings good vibes
Amazing person yaar............I love SRK
You will be more wise/educated/intellectual/smart listning to this man rather than reading books.
<b>I am sure you will be back with a Bang!!</b>
Shah rukh Khan with his fan following , money and power can create and teach so much to this nation, he can teach people to dream through a story or make people to believe they can be anything. <br>With music , Bollywood and drama he can do so much to motivate youth. Why he isint he doing that ??
Ha ha hi hi ho ho haiiiiii mess hua hai yes
what a man ! &lt;3
his hairline at this age man he is blessed
Lies of Shahrukh Khan on Islam and Quran. plz watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJlUHX0fqZg">https://youtu.be/nJlUHX0fqZg</a>
He talks soo well!! Wish srk does another romantic movie
love him so much.
😭😭😭
Srk spks well..gr8 sense of humour too.... now, he needs to start doing much more serious roles...
long live the king
Everybody likes a good cry :D that&#39;s wonderful intellect of Dr. Khan.
Rajeev&#39;s backtracking after he says Insecure... Omg I&#39;d be scared haha.SRK says he&#39;s an extremist! Me tooooo. I&#39;m just like that only.
I&#39;d like him to make a film playing  rough homeless man
Always a pleasure to listen to SRK 👏
God he has more makeup then his actress. Why can&#39;t Bollywood actors be like Brad Pitt or others who are natural when they give interview
It look like sharukh become more calmer  quit man then what he was his early years. Come back soon we miss you. Its wierd but i like duplicate movie hahahaha
His interviews are damn. He talk sensible and behaves like he has done some good movies. Itna confidence aata kaha se hai. Money may be , he is a businessman though.
Surprised Khan did not Smoke during the interview.
He is special forever ! Still Ruler and king 😊  Amazing ! He is charming and love
He has past his expiry date. Apparently nothing new to offer!
M sure srk I more comfrtble in Western contry   bcz our stupid n idiots ppl alws trolling in social media... M really very sorry sir.for thrs actvty
Sir ji ur great actr n nice person... M really very srry for our stupid people who against  u n syng stupid words in social media sir m really very srry..
Biggest achiever in the world 🤓💖💖😇.
Shahrukh khan looks so plastic, plastic. should retire now
Srk sab ka bap hai
Bollywood actors should learn how to speak and what to speak from him
Never get tired of hearing SRM
Ahar kute ka ek din atha hai Bhai tu to gaya king banta hai ahee shach hai

So down to earth and honest human being. You would never think a person of his status could remain so humble, bless him. Love his Givenchy shirt 😉
Please &quot;SRK&quot; announced your next movei name😭😭😢
I&#39;m also waiting for SRK to do a kick-ass  stylish action movie like DON!
Rajeev Masland you are also gentleman very relaxed and calm man.🔝😍🙏👍
Great human being.
Love watching SRK .
Khan saab, please stop SMOKING. I notice your nails on left index finger, that is a shit ton of nicotine stain. <b>Cancer se maroage</b> !
Free My Kashmir
The next film he should do is &quot;Kabhie Khushi Khabie Gham 2&quot; with Kajol as his wife and Aryan and Suhana as his children. XD
Either he was very tired or very distant and disppointed. His body langauge says it all. He was distant at first but in the end loosened up. I got anxiety...normally hes more lively and joking etc....he is too mature and understanding of the ups and downs now...depression...
How can he be so smart in interviews but then do garbage movies and have shit script sense..hope he can come back strong yet but its not looking likely
doobta suraj.... shah rukh bhai kuch acchi movies lao.... salute bhi krne se mana krdiya
a man who likes to talk about himself so much :D
He needs to do action movies
kudos to srk,looking fit and fab..cheers to 50
How about SRK play an attorney. I don’t think he’s fine such a character. Maybe a remake of Meri Jung !!
❤
shahrukh looks good
I saw zee cine awards with vicky and kartick. They were nice. But we miss srk the lovely entertener. No offence he is mashallah great. It was 2019 april.
Also, . Raees is ever best film mashallah. And dilwali <a href="http://awsome.in/">awsome.in</a> melbourne,he had huge success. Bless him his family.  And his whole crew. In all his films. Inshallah.
<a href="http://let.me/">Let.me</a>  tell you srk his film zero,it is not a failure<br>only you guys you do not know what is a good film all over the  world it succed and mnd blowing.
Horrible sunglasses lg rai han .ur cool and good actor
Sunglasses are not suiting SRK
Author ❤️
Good actor or not but this man is a bloody genius👍
Is SRK on coke?
He’s looking terrible.
He could do something like Amitabh Bachchans role in Badla, am sure the younger lot doesn&#39;t connect to Amitabh Bachchan anymore.. like honestly I kept thinking Amitabh Bachchan was not fit (healthwise, looked weak and tired) when i saw the movie, with all respect to him!
Love you bro
Happiness is watching SRK again n again ! Rewind mode ...
I have a feeling that he’s lost touch with ppl
If Saif Ali Khan can get a Netflix show then SRK can certainly get one! He just needs a decent script, storyline and filmmaker!
Love u SRK!
I&#39;m the only one who is frustrated because of SRK&#39;s slightly tilted Sunglasses
Wisdom + intelligence + passion + ambitious + wittiest + great sense of humor + family man + a true gentleman + best in his field + richest actor + Biggest stardom.............. = Presenting world&#39;s biggest movie star <b>SHAHRUKH KHAN</b>
انا اتمنى ترجمو عربي و شاروخان كثير حلو بس ما فتهمت اي شئ
Seeing him... just listening him is a stress-buster...♥ SRK♥ <br>One Love♥
I am big fans of sharukh kha
love you srk
Always elegant..don&#39;t miss his interviews..
You are the best!!Very surprising to see the calm side of you!!!
Shahrukh Sir kindly do that movie with director Shankar.
I wish he had taken his sunglasses off
A man with salted pepper hair
After so long i am watching Shahrukh’s interview. ♥️
King Srk
The interviewer is soooooo cuuute 😍😍
After long time
What about DON 3 I am still waiting? Or maybe some other Don kind of spin off
😊😊❤
I don’t like SRK’s interview. Because when anything come out, I leave everything and watch it right-way. Now I m watching it instead of studying.😂
Bring something new?? BC kal tak bhi tu wahi sadela haath phailana pose kar rha tha..
Not making creatively okay films and sticking to those old fashioned &quot;emotionally oversoaked&quot; films might be the reason he is not doing so good....may he returns soon...
Long live Indians,long live SRK
Got lil weak...looks thin...he shouldn’t act anymore nor his fellow actors Salman , Aamir, Akshay, Ajay....they are getting old....they should give way for the current generation actors and may be should just produce or direct....
Sir main a apse milna chahta hun
Sup fatty
The man is in a transitional stage. Hes too old for those romantic hero roles,with women half his age. Once he is done with this phase, we will have him back as an amazing actor. He just has to re-discover and find his own space.
Watching and listening this interview, so many times I was smiling without realising! SRK is genuinely grounded actor and amazing human being 🙏🏻
10,000th like
i want to kill people who say srk IS  arrogant.shahrukh Khan You are the best Come back soon .your Big fan from morroco
I really miss you srk i feel very Bad no movies this year .You are the best
aare netflix join kerle koi.......flop career save hojayga...
Intelligent King
The undisputed king 👑 of Bollywood
Pressure is consuming him.   Alas!
Why Shahrukh movies are super flop these days? Shahrukh fans are no true fans.
He&#39;s time is over! 😅 Stay in Australia and start a business there Mr. Goatee. 🐐 Ka-ka-ka kiran <br>Don&#39;t come back to India and Bollywood.
shahrukh khan ❤
Dono chutiye ek saath
Wow! What an incredible interview Rajeev!  SRK you are awesome! Can anyone please kindly advise: what is the handle to send the action screenplay to? Anyone get it? was it: @iamsrk? How do we email to there?
La Trobe is a shit university

SRK is pure soul.. so humble, down to earth and grateful guy.
Legend for a reason.
SRK u are such a good orator &amp; a very fine actor. Please make “Limitless” &amp; do the lead role.
@iamsrk
BC who is disliking this interview man? It is soo educational and sensible video....
Love you srk ❤️
I think that shahrukh sir interview is much better than lots of masala and inspirational movie
Love how shahrukh is honest about his filmography and his career. Though some of his recent films have not been good, but he accepts that, he enjoys that. He has the good guy good conversation, guy which brings you a smile aura. I&#39;m a cinephile and i&#39;ve seen almost all kinds of cinema and the best of it. But still i enjoy some of shahrukh&#39;s films as well. I won&#39;t say he&#39;s the best actor in this whole world but he is honest about who he is or where he is and that&#39;s what i love about him and that&#39;s so great about him.  I think every person who grew up here in india have watched some of his filmography and enjoyed it. Kuch kuch hota hai and many of his other films were very problematic in a moral and cinematic point of view. But still he brings a nostalgia in me. I loved his films as a child, my parents were a big fan of his and i was named after him. I enjoy all his interviews and he&#39;s very honest and intelligent from the beginning of his career. He may stop in starring in his films i think it&#39;s okay but i would love if he does keep doing talk shows or we get to hear him anyhow. Love you srk.
Sara stardom utar gaya hai sir ka🤣🤣🤣🤣
Deep Knowledge, Sensible, Charming,Philosopher,
Never a dull moment with this man
SRK ..... 💖⭐️💞👍🏽☘
What a charismatic and intelligent man Sharukh is. Love watching his interviews.
SRK sounds like an condescending douche. The fake humility, the humble bragging are as authentic as an email by a Nigerian prince promising a million dollars. Your ideas aren’t just “cultivated” they are passé.
SHAH RUKH KHAN&#39;S time is over in bollywood.
1- As far as rest, he needs it.  Since, i have discovered his films and listen to him and how he describes himself, he needs rest and time with his family.  I am sure he is working still , obviously since he is doing this interview but not to be in a film.  His body and mind needs rest.  His family needs him too. 2-Now with Bollywood films, he is correct it is nice to have emotional films.  Now they work because we all are human and have emotions and  whether you express them or not personally is another issue all together.  I got tired of Hollywood because they make it seem like there is no emotions in anything except sex and blowing things up.  I like action films too but like Avengers showed you can put emotions in it if well done. It is sad that other countries have not kept up with their culture films.  Culture is important.
Listening to him after ages is like  bliss to my ears.... always a proud fan❤❤❤❤
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23classy">#Classy</a>..<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23intelligent">#Intelligent</a>..😎✌
SRK will come back with career best film 🔥
Shahrukh khan ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑👑👑💋💓👍👍
Hey Rajeev can you ask Srk to give job to me in red chilli, I will apologize for all abusing. From a berojgaar young boy 😁
Sorry for abusing you so much. 🙏
He speaks so well!  He sounds genuinely intelligent, nothing fake about his talk.  Like everybody here, I wish he would choose his scripts a bit more wisely!
Fan, Zero and few films he did in the last few years was done with such a passion for cinema... Absolute hardwork...but it didn&#39;t work out... Fortunately, srk is blessed with such fans and resources to keep trying harder... Hope he keeps trying hard...
ये तो फिलॉस्फर बन गया 👱
SRK ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤❤ ❤❤ ❤
yaar - ye aajkal interview hi deta rehta hai - his movies are flopping like mad.
Is so ugly...and tired
Amazing interview srk❤❤ u r just a great actor as well as great intellectual person..
Shahrukh khan sir please jaldi come back karo yar missing you so much from Bangladesh brother😭😭😭😭
Only rohit shetty can help him now... he should take time &amp; decide.... it will be better he accepts his lot gracefully... than put in a lot of theories to defend it... and look awkward...
srk
srk
I wish he turn towards his belief before he dies, i want to see him in heaven as he is seriously nicest star i have ever met in my life, i met him in Rotterdam in 2003 i guess .
Do a realistic movie SRK...Done enough of Nach gana, meaning less stuff
Srk king of the world
King Khan Shah Rukh Khan Baadshah of Bollywood love you King Khan sir..😘😘
Superb SRK
Dude....you love NYC...you love TV. You just gotta do SNL with your kids.
somebody who does or has been doing the same thing again and again in every other movie is talking about bringing something new...what an irony!!
Love you Shah Rukh
Shah rukh khan is the biggest movie star on the earth💗💗💗
King 👑❤️❤️❤️❤️
SRK u have been my childhood crush !! But offlate I feel u should do web series!! You are doing great in your business ipl !! You are a superstar always but now people like something new each day !! No point doing movies which don’t work !!
It&#39;s literally blisss to just listen this guy talk
I&#39;m waiting for the day when he&#39;ll interview, Sandeep Vanga Reddy.
Love you
He is a good man , you can just tell !!!
Hey, rajeev. Absolute amazing interview! Just wondering that the hotel where this interview is done is if Sofitel Melbourne?
Irony is he is getting recognised for his work, when his &quot;work&quot; is mostly flops. Only movie actors can be worshipped even when they fail.<br><br>Jeez a doctorate !!
Rajeev gets roasted and that&#39;s what he deserves. King at his best.
His interviews are very insightful and witty.
I think SRK should give chances to new and talented directers and <br>All these years he is in commercial cinema so he should do experimental cinema also
Srk
It&#39;s not extremely unique...it&#39;s because of population 11: 30

Where are you sitting guys. I m feeling tensed 😟.  Maybe you are on some edge of the room.
WAS THE KING AND WILL FOREVER BE THE KING
Sharukhs movies like Swedes and chack de india and trimurti was good he should make more movies similar like that love from Pakistan 🇵🇰
Was shahrukh khan actor badge really necessary rajiv to show 😂😂
He was, is and always will be one of the best actors the country has seen. 👌😊
It&#39;s been a decade since he&#39;s working on his book. I can vouch one thing it would be no less than Bible itself.
Ye unlike krne wale kon hote h<br>.....
KING KHAN 😍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=535">8:55</a> 😂😂 indeed
At least he is admitting that nobody is offering many films as he use to get. I agree he needs to focus on producing now. But he is a fine human being. 🤗
SRK IS LOVE🖤❤️
Again action movies! 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
A gentleman in tinsel town for sure 👍🏻
Akshay Kumar is the best
I’m from Melbourne and I feel so good to see him speaking highly of Melbourne. We are proud of you King khan.
I love Shahrukh khan
Why SRK giving interview to this Fat Guy...Choottad. . Critic
Khan sb very smart,wise move joining and working with Netflix because its a multibillion industry.
I&#39;m more into his interview and speeches than movies. He is simply awesome and brilliantly simple by not looking simple.
How politics fucks you up. Supposed intolerance and its omnipresence and then fooling around during election time has taught this chap hard lessons
This guy had crossed 50 having said that he sounds 20
Can’t concentrate.. distracted by the stars on his collar 🌟
buddha paagal ho gaya, n people still listen to his excuses n lies to keep him in the game. He looks ill and slow somewhat - i suspect something.<br>Still wants to be an Amitabh Bachchan, but never can be. Thats why he wants to do action now coz he got slotted in 90s as lover boy.
Dhoom 3 or Don 3 nothing else
SRK I love you😍😍😍😍😍
<i>Zero</i> might&#39;ve fallen through, but he&#39;s also co-produced <i>Badla</i> and that was huuuge
Don 3 SRK come back.....
i am surely say that  srk&#39;s next  film is  India&#39;s biggest film   he again rule Bollywood and world also
War 🔥<br>Hrithik ⚔️ Tiger<br>2nd oct in cinemas<br>Excited = Like
He seems old and low
I think <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23srk">#srk</a> sir need to be more proactive in content.. All his recent films lacks that that core content which can attract the audience... No one can beat in acting wise but stories  r required  to take the filmforward(i understand he knows better than me but my views r being a fan who want to see srk)
Big fan but in past 7 years his movies suck !!
SRK, Satyajit Ray and Amitabh Bachchan were the ones who made Bollywood famous worldwide.<br>But I think SRK alone (with Aamir to an extent) made Bwood a brand.<br>Jo Bollywood ke liye itna kuch kiya, usko aaj troll karte he kuch dickheads....
Why the shades onn... Cant he give interview without shades onn... Even Tom Cruise gives interview without SHADES aka goggles...
Bloody anti national. He is the only ipl owner with no local legend like dada. He will find a captain from pakistan. His next movie will be on  justify jehad by katuyas.
My honest opinion SRK sir, please just do another K3G , Kal Ho Na Ho , Kuch Kuch Hota Hai type, family entertainer and now play a role as a grown up not a youngster, leave the action movies to the rest, ur best in the emotional,lovey dovey roles.
No glasses plz
Srk 😘my heart beat says this to me daily 😍😍😘 happiness overloaded
He has nothing to lose. He can afford a 1000 flops. You shit guys dont know what he and Red Chillies is doing behind the scenes making Indian cinema so world class .. many of the artistic class movies r being backed by them directly or indirectly .. in front what he is doing is what others would not afford to risk .. thats simple enough to understand ..
Any one notice the star on SRK&#39;s collar 😍😍😍
So nice. More of this kind be it anyone
Has he undergone some surgery?? He has a lisp. He can&#39;t pronounce the letter &quot;s&quot; properly
God..Shahrukh is awesome
Love u SRK.... I can here you all day long...
How can someone be that good in communication and give instant reply which make huge sense
SRK❤️❤️❤️

Shahrukh&#39;s description of Bollywood is everything I hate about it. Thankfully that has changed with audience being mature and that&#39;s why old stars aren&#39;t able to kill it no more. The future is now ....
srk love
Hit like if you love the way how SRK speaks and makes people around him to smile<br>Shah Rukh Khan The Greatest Of All Time
Budha ho gaya
personally think SRK needs to show his acting skills now and not sign movies to stay in the biz or please fans. Audience have lots of options now through digital platforms. We will not watch poor content only blind followers do. He is a great actor and it disappoints me when he signs movies like Zero.
IFFM honouring Bollywood&#39;s Best with the Excellence in Cinema Awards:<br>2017: Aishwarya Rai<br>2019: SRK
He truly is King.

🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘
Do don-3 man.... thats the game changer
U r done your time has gone just u should take production seriously
Very nice lov you SRK
You should came out from your comfort zone..it&#39;s my personal request sir😊
Take your time and back with good script..we are waiting 🤗
I don’t see any exaggeration from this fat uncle now, I wonder why tho or he was just expecting Srk to leave and bring out his dictionary find weird words and start judging
I was expecting some good roast of SRK... But as usual bikaau reporter rajeev...
Waiting king 😎🔥
SRK as Iron man! 💖
His face is getting so slim <br>He looks v old now <br>It’s time for him to retire and chance to new talent to be given
Love this guy,  I am big fan of his interviews tha movies maybe. <br><br>But looks like age has struck him.  <br><br>Anyway Still lots of love.
Regardless of his brilliant roles in cinema and wonderful presence as a worldwide megastar, what I respect in him the most is his humility and honesty which makes him bring his life&#39;s weaknesses and failures out in words and shares them in almost every interview. He always admits that he is just a lucky regular Indian who found bread in acting which was never his dream. He deserves a lot of respect.
Most charismatic actor in the planet ♥️
Shah Rukh Khan has NO looks. He is in Bollywood only because the standards have been lowered for political reasons. No star by any measure.
That Fat guy is back .. what his name .., 🤣😂
My love 😍
SRK made us and India 🇮🇳 proud in the entire world.
plz just check the ROCKETRY :THE NAMBI EFFECT. It is the movie directed by R Madhavan and the cast includes him as Dr.Nambi Narayan ..........you all will be shocked after learning the mars mission and the injustice towards our padma bhushan award winner scientist Nambi Narayan and the effect it had on the mars mission in 1990..........<br>also loving the interview<br><br><br>p.s. yes the mission to mars could be possible 20 yrs ago....<br><br><br><br>p.s. Sharukh khan is also in cast btw for all the fans.......
<b>Fati padi hai</b> playing in the background
The main problem with SRK is that his recent movies start strong and from the middle, it just falls apart. I don&#39;t know is this because of his lack of creativity with his scripts or he just lets the scriptwriters do their thing. Example: zero. it was very strong until srk decided to go to the fucking MARS. why man?! He should follow Amir. he should be attached to every part of the film.
This comment section proved that SRK has a very classy, decent and very intelligent audience!
Something wrong with his voice. He is lisping, is he?
I&#39;ve never seen SRK so down and nervous. He is clearly upset with his films not doing well these days.
Those 201 haters of humanity....who disliked the video
I can listen to this man till death 🤦🏻‍♂️
Biggest movie star in the world ❤️<br>love you SHAH RUKH KHAN❤️👻
Waiting for Bard of Blood....sure that will change things for him....respect him
King khan you are the best  love you  proud  of you <br>you  are my inspiration
Thanks Rajeev. SRK is always a listening pleasure. I’m glad he is interested in action films, I’m game for it.
Shahrukh can explain higher rank trait bounds
Buddha ho gaya hai
Srk zindabad
He looks more plastic now than his wax statue!
His era is over? Anyone agree...its new India
Hate this journalist love srk
275k views? He is over.
Srk king is bollywood
53 from which bloody angle man..timeless charm❤️
Plzzz announce the project.......
I can hear this man talk about trees, cars, food, science and million more topics omg
Ye behen ke take ko band karooo....full bakwassss
I don&#39;t like this YouTube this page not even the host Rajeev Masand .. it&#39;s just SRK .. I had to get back ..
Proud to be a srkian 💓
Love him to the moon and back ❤️
srk we need money heist :(
Hollywood films r overtated..<br>Bollywood films formate r too good. It has everything its connect with ppl..
Docter than an Actor.. This cracked me up 🤣🤣🤣
Feel irritate when some 1 says come back.. I wanna say he haven&#39;t gone anywhere stupid
I can here SRK all day❤️
are ye bakri is here we want harry met segal 2  😜
I am liking how SRK escaping from his King Khan persona.He has became more Realistic and talks brilliant. Hope he comes with good script coz there is no better actor of last generation and even this generation than him.I always love to see him in character driven roles than commercial movies.
I follow Rajeev Masand bcz of this gentleman 🙏👑
A man rule million of heart &amp;Always young and gr8 sense of humor
Waiting for DON-3.....These types of Gangster war movies suits SRK...Few eg: Don, Don-2,Raees
&quot;साहो&quot; का ट्रेलर आया,पर मज़ा नहीं आया.<br><a href="https://bolcinema.blogspot.com/2019/08/blog-post_11.html">https://bolcinema.blogspot.com/2019/08/blog-post_11.html</a>
SRK should remake Tamil film Mankatha to revive his career..
Patla ho gaya hai SRK. King Khan.
I hope Marvel is listening &#39;SRK&#39; wants to play Iron man in India!!!!!<br><br>What do u think will he be a good cast for The role?
How did this 17-minute video go by so quickly? ❤
Love you SRK ❤
Smart, intelligent, witty, precious, charismatic...I can go on and on! 💜
SRK should do podcasts his voice is so beautiful
Really sweet...
King srk
I always admire the way SRK do his work and carry himself. But past few movie choices and wanting to be central character and revolves whole movie around him had led to his down fall. He needs to understand time has changed so the audiences, now people care more for good story, acting and great direction. Hope he gets this as he is knowledgeable actor and been amazing over the past two decades.
Rajeev sir, <br>Just a humble request ,can u please improve your audio quality
SRK♥️♥️♥️♥️
I can never get tired of listening to SRK-The king truly.....Always humble and witty. And Rajeev Masand you may be a harsh critic and I don&#39;t really like it when you review movies..tbh....but your interviews are worth watching cause you really know what to ask.
Oh my god a PARASITE entered srks beautiful hair
His interviews are better than his movies! Interviews reflects his education and intelligence.
SRK needs really good action films or thriller movies<br>He should play a cop or a spy
Oh God! What has he done to himself? His lower teeth are full of smoking stains. Wrinkles everywhere! Thin body and face! SRK dude, stop smoking for your kids’ sake! You used to be a good looking fella.
Bollywood Badshah and The INDIAN AMBASSADOR OF CINEMA being so humble and confessing that he did mistakes is a great quality
You want to give something new back to the industry. Are you serious? You are one actor who openly claims that you don&#39;t have to update anything, thought can just survive with same old - king of romance type expressions, same old dialogue timing. Now, you should realize why you fell back in competition. SRK ji, your movies run well in Mumbai while rest of the India, sad part is dubbing movies started to fare well at ticket counters than yours&#39;. Last two decades, apart from Chak De, which of your movies have u offered anything new, SRK ? Zero?, Ra One?, MNIK? Dear Zindagi? Raees? Please stop.
He seems to b sooo nervous .I miss his confidence fr last 5 years
I just watched Swades, I feel amazing!<br>Always an SRK
lol felt like i was watching a bobble head interview shahrukh khan
Don series is coming next; Decode his words Action, Action, Action &amp; one liners :D !
Love you king khan
Most overrated actor in the world but his fans are commenting like he wins Oscar,some of them says &quot;biggest movie star&quot; ...hahaha...seriously like Leonardo di Caprio,Tom Cruise,Tom Hank,Brad Pitt,Matt Demon,Robert de niro,Russell Crowe are nobody in front of him.... hahaha grow up SRK fans, see the world, India is 3rd world country ,developed  country don&#39;t care about Indian films, Indian films makes little business in developed country because of NRI, we as a nation have to grow up a lot ,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23don">#don</a>&#39;t disrespect SRK, but also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23don">#don</a>&#39;t call him &quot;world&#39;s biggest star&quot;
Love you shah rukh  ❤️
So Proud of you SRK<br>Allah give you all happiness and healthy life forever.... Luv U with all due respect.
Eureka tower behind you Austraila’s tallest

Why doesn’t he just do Don 3 with Kangana and Alia.
Chak de India.... 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Like/dislike his brand of cinema, can never hate the man.
mazak mazak mein SRK sir ne bhaut kuch sikha diya...bhaut logon ko pta bhi nhi chala hoga
Mai toh bas piche ka view enjoy kar rha tha 😅😅
Really amazing personality of srk when will he say i am doing don 3 ya dhoom4? My ear will eager hear it.
U always king srk💯🇮🇳
The greatest ever. Nobody will ever come close ❤️
i think he should do mission impossible kind of movie
Srk is Iron Man fan...😊😊😊
SRK deserves all the happiness in this world. 😘
Listening to him is like healing from illness
Not a big fan of him as an actor but till today I have never been able to stop his  interview midway.
Oh my God SRK never ceases to amaze me. He&#39;s literally beauty with brains. He&#39;s intellectual, charming and learn from his mistakes kinda person. Loved the interview ❤️ Thank you @RajeevMasand for this.
Did anyone not tell SRK, that his glasses are not in place.<br>It&#39;s oddly unsatisfying.
stop it with the shitty movies dude.... either make good ones or become a producer. it prefer the former cause i love you but god you make shitty movies, i haven&#39;t seen any of your movies in past 6 years and i just want to see the 2000&#39;s srk.
M always speechless whenever I see shahrukh sir seeing him make me hpy n mashallah he is so handsome he will turn 54 now n he is looking like 25 years old boy I love him unconditionally 😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😘😘😘😘😘😚😚😚
There&#39;s only one king in the world🇸🇷🇰<br>None can beat u....U are the best nd will remain the best....
Towards the end of the interview in the long shot srk looks like a duplicate srk with those glasses!
Love u srk sir ❤
Angrej ki aulaad bhosdike
The king khan
You really need to work on your audio volume, Rajeev. It was a struggle listening even at full volume.
Sweet srk
Watching SRK is always a  joy. Ranveer Singh is modern SRK. Both are full of wits and energy. I don&#39;t know why SRK  features looking similar to the Nasiruddin Shah
Restlessly peaceful. How good is that.<br>I remember he once came up with word &quot;Demotional&quot;(Emotionally detached).
Love u king khan
😍😍😍😍
I think he’s gonna do Don 3 coz he said the dialogue at the end
Nice interview. Though, the short hair on Rajeev&#39;s forehead are disturbing. 😄
Lot of love n respect for SRK. From Pakistan
Looking fresh look young and fresh like 28 years old
Love shahrukh Khan bhai waiting for your new movie announcement
This guy is different from others..
he is such a charmer
King is king

Love u srk always
Once a Shahrukh Khan fan ...always a Shahrukh Khan fan for life..forever...💕
Sharukh please make a movie with you in the main role for the mature audience!!! Not the  action movie!!!<br>A nice story. You are a romantic hero!!<br>We mature audience 40+ want a serious movie!!! <br>So sick of seeing half naked girls dancing. I loved you in ‘Jab Tak hai jaan’ make such movies!!!
No Abram and Aryan can take your place SRK <br>King cant come back in any face <br>I just love to watch your hits still😘<br>May your time has been gone in cinema but u r still in our hearts😍😍😍
Srk is one of the best dressed celebrities in the world
As well as being an extremely successful Star. He is also a genuinely nice guy too. Love
Shah is amazing vibe
This is the most different interview of Srk , him being calm, humble, peaceful . Even Srk haters should watch this
Loved srk interview
I spent 12 hours on set when he filmed Chak De India, he was so humble and wonderful with fans
Tell you what, I&#39;m gonna write an action film for SRK....but how would it reach him tho?
Salt and pepper hair guy 😂😂😂
Just announce your next movie srk...Eagerly waiting..love you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=433">7:13</a> why thank you for that
this man is breathtaking, simply breathtaking
Srk is most overrated tatti actor ever
I could never be able to express my gratitude for the way this phenomenal person has shaped my mindest and enhanced my life. I could spend an eternity just by gazing at him or listening to his voice. He has set an epitome of the perfect husband-father and most importantly the matchless human being, to be precise! ❤
Love u sir
Shah rukh please do a horror comedy film.😍😍😍😍
I am downloading the video for the content that start at 6.00
The way he talks about his kids is jus another level. Teaching them wat real movie making is. Not jus throwing them into rough waters like other star kids.
How much humble this man is
Your last watchable film was actually Chak De..
We really miss srk from big screen,  he need a great return , he will be back for sure.
Please either do a longer one or a few more of the same length with one and only!! SRK The KING of hearts!!
I would love to see him as the “Professor” in the Indian adaptation of the Money heist
I am here for Shahrukh Khan 😍😍😍😍😍😘💯💯💯💯💯💯😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
You talked about intolerance in India with Rajdeep... Since then all your movies are flop. Enjoy !
He’s truly a King......
srk is best and true legend class knowledge intelligence and everything a lot of positive vibes love u man
I m big fan of shah rukh, but i feel now he must leave the industry, bht hardwork kr lia bht paisa b earn kr lia, ab being muslim apna role play kre with family, abram ko mandar ya gurdwara k bjae masjid le k jae, itna kuch kr k b shah rukh satisfied ni lgta
No star can touch his level of talking style and his inteactulity.... He is master of how talk like gently  ? World biggest superstar rather than anyone
Fans always wait for u love u
Why did you shave ?<br>You look dam cool in light beard. 🤴🤴🤴
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=435">7:15</a> lol.... that&#39;s the srk we all love
Thank you sir Saha Rukh Khan😍😍😘😘
Chachundar K  sar  p na bhaye  chameli.chasma pauwe  mooh  p chutiya
This man is lit 🔥
He has been failing for the last 12 years, he influences all awards and most critics. Yet people still dance to his tune. Grow up and understand that there are other people who deserve the  fandom and accolades, guys! This guy is NOT the &#39;king&#39; of bollywood!
King khan
He is such a good Orator man..... His charisma, sense of humour , witty nature.... God I can just listen to him for hoursss
SRK as Iron man please :)
Salt and pepper hair wala
&#39;I will make same mistakes as what I had done in the past years&#39; So what.....<br><br>This is class
Who cares...what he makes...Empty halls...  Few over made-up.. Fat dumb...  Over the top ladies...  Uncle..  Aap apni be-izzati karate rahoge...
king khan......rocks
पाकिस्तान को 45 करोड Donate करने वाले शाहरुख खान को भारत के कोल्हापूर, सांगली में  बाढ-पिडीत नहीं दिख रहे क्या ??
SRK ❤️ !<br><br>He speaks so well !
Shahrukh khan please make more films....
Abhi Anupama chopra ka interview bhi aayega
Sharukh is sharukh ...., m from DDLJ DAys...
I can listen to his interviews for time immemorial his......his intellect, his wit......😍🤟🙋Love him❤️..Always so happy to see him👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨
Y r u so charming ♥️
He&#39;s actually really intellectual. Always knows what he&#39;s talking about and that comes with experience.
Greatest..
Pure love....srk😘
This guy oozes class!
Dhoni of Bollywood
Bless you King Khan!❤

King is Back
❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
Please make 2 hours long interview.... This is not enough
I watched the whole interview??seriously??<br>Without any fast forwarding it even for a 10 sec...<br>This man Srk....never gets you bored.. You can just keep on staring at him.. The whole day..
Always love the truth and wit.
It&#39;ll correct he ll do Marsal remake if he wants to do action film.<br>He already met Atlee in Chennai few weeks ago
Urs time to rest kkr..
What are the upcoming movies of SRK?
Love you SRK
Sorry to say his stardom is over..Cant think of a 100 crore film for years when ayushman movies do that now.
Brilliant interview. Loved every second of it
So good to see you sir!!!
What a absolute kind hearted man - this is why ive been mad crazy about him since baazigar!. A true gent x
SRK I love you 😍
World&#39;s biggest mega movie star shah rukh khan talk
Plzzz do films like chakde india and don 2
Rajiv Masand did not interview Yash.
in short he is still waiting for same old crap
We will wait<br>Just do DON 3
You are a very good public soeaker but you should keep a beard
Karan johar and srk had given nepotism a height , they fuck up the career of those who dont join them....bloody hypocrites , egoist , they have bought entire page 3 of every media house
Flop actor...right from ra one his every movie is flop , not a single movie with sense like 3 idiots,  gajni ....nothing but just unrealistic love romance... even telgu movies are far better
This fat guy criticize kabir singh... chutiya critics
❤️❤️❤️
Rajeev... I think u should start film essay video
We miss u srk
I love his intellect. Nobody answers better than him, I can just spend time by listening to him all day!
Take your time sir for your next movie
srk i am with u from dust to down
he is always  well spoken , i enjoy watching his interviews .i&#39;m big fan of SRK
Please iska part 2 nikalo yaar
I love the way rajeev masand interviews the actors and uses his words correctly during asking questions.... Love shahrukh khan answering the questions honestly....
Knowledgeable, charming and charasmatic actor who speaks like a responsible man. Only srk in BW.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23king">#King</a> always king hota hai  ,
Masand licking SRK&#39;s ass, his true colors showed in the interview with Anand Kumar. Can he dare to ask hard questions to SRK ?
SRK plleeaaasseee please please plleeaaasseee play IRON MAN!! I have been seeing you as iron man since like forever!!!!
SRK- Let&#39;s hope he makes a Major Turnaround. Not much Love from Audience of late.
He oozes charisma.
I am more a doctor than actor -  I thought doctors are different. Doctorates are different. They are not the same.
He has started looking too old now
Srk u r really gooood in making audience cry , u have to get back to do movies like veer-zara , mohabbatein, swades etc , all srkians are waiting to see that srk.
He is the same guy who does add for stupid fair and handsome Cream, such a hypocrite.
apne dil jaysa huwa action film aayenge 💥💥💥💥💥💥
Silk like Charm..Love from pune to srk
Sir I want Srk to do a Mani ratnam film next up as he brings the best out of actors and one of Srk best works has been with Mani ratnam and Ashutosh gowariker swades
Old Hollywood was musical and exquisite. G-D save us from this wicked generation, they&#39;ve ruined everything. Hai ALLAH.
Love u srk
WHAT  A LEGEND
Love his interviews. He is just so articulate and a wise man! ❤️ Always learn something new from his interviews. 🙏🏻
Looks like a ghost of his former self
He obviously got fresh botox...looks plastic barbie doll...
Charming as ever
He’s the reason why I’m so love to Bollywood movies.. 💕<br><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fanofsrk">#fanofSRK</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23immalaysian">#ImMalaysian</a>
Witty....
Bhai love ❤️🔥🔥🔥
Just look how simple this man is i have always admired him for his humbleness and down to earth attitude and it&#39;s always great to hear him speak he always speaks his heart out great man he is
King of the Bollywood... n yet sooooo humble... 😄
When a ShahRukh Khan interview drops... I stop everything and watch it right away...<br><br>I guess i am his interviews and speeches more fondly than his movies... <br><br>Love this guy
Glad to see nd listen to him after so longggggggg<br>I miss you Shahrukh. Plz do movie soon.😍
If you need motivation watch SRK interview!
RESPECT
Dhoom 4 ..we want srk
&quot;Everybody at certain time wants to have a good cry &quot;<br>Words 😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘
Was waiting to see this man since so long Inspiration for life 😍♥️SRK SACCHA RAJA
SRK is incredibly charismatic and continuously evolving both as a person and artist. Thats why when he talks not only fans but crtics get enchanted by his persona and charm.
It was sad seeing him in very mediocre scripts like Chennai Express , Happy New year , Zero etc. In past few years only good one was Fan.  Hope to see him in a script that brings out his best . Love SRK ❤️
How is he so enlightened? so modest? so entertaining? so sexy? I should have made the trip from Perth to perhaps catch a glimpse of him
Looking like Irfan Khan he needs script like Saaho or chak de india to do a miracle at box office, don&#39;t know why he is choosing script which doesn&#39;t work in trailer itself
Can anyone tell me which sunglasses SRK is wearing?
kumar vishwas and shahrukh man are treat to ears, bas sunte jaaaooo sunte jaaaoooo
Love this Man
First time he admitted, I don&#39;t make cinema like that....
I think he meant rajeef about kicking somebody ass
Welcome to the Most Livable City in the world Sir Shahrukh Khan and Mr Rajeev Masand. Hope you enjoy your stay here. Just keep yourself warm as it is not the best time of the year ☺️❤️💐
Shahrukh sir is just amazing, we love u sir just bring new movie
waoooo..listening srk is  a n addiction
Srk ur fans r  waiting for don 3 with more suspence...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=459">7:39</a> Best part 😂
Please give this man a good script!! He deserves it.
Awesome interview of one &amp; only one SRK. He should come back with DON 3.
King
Looking forward to see his upcoming Netflix show Betaal. He is very clever businessman.
I have never seen a man this witty, this content. His wisdom, his aura/charm is so big yet so humble.
Amitabh Sir is the Emperor. SRK is the King. Two living legends of our time. None can match.
I wish there is SRK interview every week, i missed listening him.
Nothing else just love you ❤💋
Compare this interview with AIB podcast, energy levels are in contrast. Just recreate yourself with Don-3. I wish if SRK could make a guest appearance in Jack Ryan season 2 or any Action series.
Buddha hogaya SRK
Can listen to this man all day long. Big fan! ❤️
❤ my first love ❤
Person who makes me smile😄😊,, in all my mood
What i observe from few of his last interviews that srk lost confidence on himself after zero failure n 150 cr loss foim that film.. Thats why he z scaring to take any project under his red chily banner.. N also no1 z  offerng  him films now
Love Shahrukh bountiful. Irreplaceable.
Take a vijay sethupati interview<br>He is also in IFFM
Rajeev is Blabbering infront of Srk maybe he should select Salman khan for Next cozy Interview😂
Effortless cool! Possibly the coolest man Earth!
Such  Charming and intellectual gem of person I find myself hooked on his interview as always.
&#39;Don&#39; franschise will continue !!
He&#39;s hurt.. it&#39;s quite evident!<br>Come back sooner King Khan! ❤️
I don&#39;t want to see him in an action film , he just don&#39;t look convincing as an action hero
THIS Man......i just cant....intelligence is pouring out of his ears. SRK forever.
Luv u soooo much srk....waiting eagerly for the announcement of your next movie
Thank you Masand bhai for the video
This look of sharukh khan is perfect for james bond movie
Shahrukh sir u r my idol.. n im eagely waiting fr ur next movie.. n plzz dont stop doing good romantic movies like u use to do before with yash chopra.. aditya chopra.. karan johar.. etc.<br>Love u lotttt shahrukh sir♡
Aaj shahrukh ko dekhkar lagta hai insaan aaj bhi bander hi hai......ha ha ha
What about Baadhshah 2??
called King Khan for a purpose. I love him.
nothing last forever --<br><br>Rajesh Khanna<br>Amitabh Bachhan<br>Govinda<br><br><br>Now Sharukh ....<br><br>I think he should start change gear like Amitabh bachhan and let fresh blood take over.
Stupid Masan....
What happened with rajiv hair ?
U are 😍😍😍
Srk😘😘😘
The beautiful thing about srk he knows his value as agreat actor and as intelligent person and Bollywood will loose a uniqu actor if the audience remains critical him badly even his last filme didn&#39;t make well  ppl most not forget his great achievement
Love you ❤️
Acha mic lelo yaar
Shahrukh, I have a story at hand and I want you to act in it. It could be a good Netflix story.
When SRK speaks, whole world listen....
He Is Love ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rather than a action or fun film I really wish he do more films like Swadesh and Chak de
Shahrukh Sir if you not going to change the choice of films  you have made in the past , you will lose your popularity
Dying to watch SRK on the big screen. He&#39;s one of the reasons why people from all over the world know that Indian film industry is a force to reckon with.
I can listen to this man all day, SRK<br>thank you Rajeev
Said no to movies like Lagaan, 3 idiots, Munna bhai, Jodha Akbar, Rand de Basanti  🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Believe Me He Is Coming With BANG !!
when SRK talks, we listen
He understands bollywood movie business than any other persons in bollywood
Always have and forever will love Shahrukh Khan 😍😍😍😍😍
He may not have given us blockbusters in the recent past, but I will forever be a fan of him, not just for his amazing acting skills but also for the kind of person he is, a self-made man with great intelligence and charisma.
I can listen to this man all my life ❤❤❤❤ how articulate and wise he is.
Why should you interview an irrelevant, has-been who was always a mediocre actor? What a waste. And for the record I didn&#39;t watch this crap. Just really wanted to comment
SRK sir I always get glued to ur words..
This man is an inspiration for everyone.
Shahrukh Jaise Acting karna, mushkil hi Nahi, Namumkin hai . 🙏
I love this soooOOO much, wow, what a frkn legend
How about SRK doing Mohanlals Lucifer remake
Bhai ganja fooonk ke baithe hain kya chasma kahe nahi utarte.
The look is straight outta Badshah Movie 😍
Wow....nothing excites and relaxes me more than his voice
I&#39;m crying 😭😭😭😭 you are love ❤❤❤ you are miracle!!!
Been so long since srk spoke in an interview. Awesome.. 🥰 hearing him makes my day
You are most beautiful thing on earth ... love you srk ❤
Why Rajjev masand is wearing a sweater, lol :-)
Patiently waiting for your next sir ❣
He has always signed movies on impulse! not sure if that is the way to go now, but he is SRK! he can bloody well do what he wants. Flops be damned!
Charming, awesome, handsome, charismatic, humble and sooo wise,he deserves every appreciation he gets always ,love you Shah Rukh Khan ❤
The KING !
ILU KING KHAN ALWAYS FOREVER😘😘😘😘💪💪💪💪💪
He looks like a dried raisin. Time to retire with dignity !
That’s a lot of SRK saying yaar
love you forever my @iamsrk
What a guy is shah rukh... can hear all day long just so so charming man.. proud to be your fan forever 💖
Shahrukh Khan is not restricted to acting only. He is an excellent businessmen, Speaker. Respected worldwide.. great personality ✌️
Stop shaking ur head Rajeev Sir. It seem like u r head shaking doll and your remote is lost.
Shahrukh looks so ugly...
If a documentary was made on Srk&#39;s life, I believe people would rather prefer to watch that than his own films.
He is always amazing 😍
I can listen to this man till death(2)
🖤
Is it me or he looks so different .

Don 3 please Shah &lt;3
Dude you all are doing Srk srk  ,just look at his health?!
Most informed actor of Bollywood now
This rajeev masand is the worst film critic in the whole world...
What a well spoken guy he&#39;s. So witty, so funny, so smart!!!!! Love you Shahhh
The realest of people are the most vulnerable, honest, unsure, confused and all things else that usually not everyone wants to acknowledge. This is just that! <br>Fantastic interview!
Why so short? Pls make 2 hrs long interview...anyway tq so much Rajeev! <br>Missing SRK on screen even for his interviews...
He is class !
Srk😍
Retire finish game over srk
Hindi bolo thodi sunne mein Maja Aaye 🇮🇳
Mr khan I don&#39;t know whether you Will read this or not but for ideas you have to pay me😉 Rajiv ki toh lay li Aapne last mein it&#39;s just that working with married bygone less talented heroines with you isn&#39;t working anymore whatever you say। You have a heart of gold And infectious energy you can use that somewhere elae acting I personally won&#39;t like to see from you And yes you have turned into a good doctor more than an actor you are a Therapy Now was watching Fauji since those years back couldn&#39;t watch it bcoz of studies when you can&#39;t recreate those things better do something else (from a well wisher) you are like a parent figure to many please don&#39;t romance on-screen anymore spare the horror🙏your God has been Very gracious to you I never write letter to anyone except you not even to leaders I like bcoz in your case my fingers compels me to write😂🙏hope I could be as professional and lovable as you some Day your kids are very lucky to have a father like you btw mufassa was too good was more similar to Marlon Brando in godfather than mufassa🙈<br>And please no lungi dance on iron Man Shah rukh🙏Tony Stark is already gone Spidey is here And you are talking about bringing back the dead to do lungi dance no please🙏

Rajiv sir u give us big gift as SRk interveiw
Did SRK sit on his sunglasses?
He is always exceptionally charming   on and off the screen. Missing him badly in big screen💔😭 much love srk 💋💋
Dear <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rajeevmasand">#RAJEEVMASAND</a>  I believe if Money heist is made in Indian Cinema <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23shahrukhkhan">#Shahrukhkhan</a> is perfect choice for Professor role. As he has same personality and aggression.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please Do an Action movie asap SRK 😭😍🙏🙏
Srk sir looking very good and the  senario see in your back it&#39;s great view
Please work on your sound system , it&#39;s really low.
Last few films didn&#39;t do well, still is the KING!!❤️🔥<br>Richest actor in the world!!
Eden Gardens❤ SRK❤ love from Bengal
Thank you Rajeev...SRK  is a charmer..still shy..witty..honest.❤
I love shahRukh Khan
Okay, he is keep going to make those stupid movies. Great!!!!
Aisa LG rha tha ki khtm hi na hobye vdeo.....<br>Luvvv uuu sir
waiting for your interview with vijay sethupathi
loved the interview
When he talks 🔥😸 Such an inspiring superstar. We indians are proud to have the most iconic, honorable, charming, biggest superstar .  Shah Rukh Khan 🇮🇳
Sir please make DON 3  because it will be having action and one liners what you want
he is only global superstar and other local Indian stars cant match his popularity , yet low iq sanghi mind/ brain washed mango Indian people abuse him
Finally Kashmir is free. SRK should congratulate India and Kashmiris for the progress they will make after 370 is gone.
Lagend.. Great man
This can&#39;t be his upcoming movie trailor.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKQ8Qt-SiH4">https://youtu.be/sKQ8Qt-SiH4</a>
he loves abram &lt;3
BULLSHIT
Love u SRK
Look at his crafts of speaking, you can learn so much from this guy , the way he treat , the way he speak fluently seems like all scripted no one can talk like Shahrukh Khan. The man himself a king , got scholarship for Indian girls. 🚩👏
This man is a gem. Nothing better than watching him early in the morning.
One Q. Pleased add when interview with SRK...<br>&quot; You&#39;re planning on DON 3 or not ? &quot;<br>Every time we asked this Q. Farhan akhtar...
The most charismatic person I have known is SRK.. it&#39;s not about the movies he do , it&#39;s about how he is as a person ,the sensibilities the presence the aura the righteousness the humbleness  the  IQ and of course his love ...words are less to describe him ..love you SRK ❤❤ always a jabra fan😁😋😊
How can someone be so charming that it comes across through an interview??!!!
King
Weekend made
Restlessly peaceful is a bullshit
Just see with how much respect he&#39;s talking to Rajeev.
ANNOUNCE DON 3!!! srk wants an action film
He&#39;s looking so old! Seems he&#39;s done a lot of aesthetic treatments.
Ha ha ha bhai ab koi dhang k role karo..romantic hero ab  ahi..
How calm he is yr..ZEROs failure destroyed him😕 indian audience destoryed his hopes..he dont deserve to be in india
Next Action Film of SRK Can Be Dhoom 4 or Don 3 but chances are more for Dhoom 4
Love you Srk
is that he hinted for DHOOM4 ???
We miss you SRK! 😍 please do a movie soon :)
Masand ji u are pathetic u just called those u are interested with
A great interview! I can see SRK getting his groove back
Can hear SRK whole day
Guy has gotten so thin
He is just something else ❤
Srk should sit home. He has tons of money fooling his fans in past. Nobody can tolerate his poor acting now
Miss the vintage. He looks so made up these days . Spontaneity of vintage SRK is missing in both his look &amp; words. Confidence &amp; humility has been replaced by confusion &amp; insecurity. Even bit of frustration is blinking in his words &amp; posture. So sad for an old SRK fan like me.😌 He looks like trying to be someone else in pursuit of looking like macho &amp; cool ignoring his originality.
Legendary

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=1005">16:45</a> dhoom4 hint??
I wanna travel to India and learn more informations about India, because of Mr. Shahrukh Khan and others. This should be perfect for India. If someone takes care of my country for my people&#39;s good work and wants to investigate, I am proud of it and respect the people who provide it. Whether I like them or not. I don&#39;t have to be a fan of this. And I don&#39;t have to be from the same nation to respect someone and appreciate what they do. <br>Respect and love are very important for me and I can see it in his behavior and his actions. But I cannot know his normal life or his real thoughts. I&#39;m just commenting on what I see. I respect him so much. I am not Indian I am from Turkey. We do not have to love anybody else. But I think we should be respect and proud and grateful of who is hard working and trying more like Dr. Shah Rukh Khan. I think his contribution and appreciate the innovations his bring to develop India and for education and foundation and Hindi Cinema etc... need to respect from especially Indian Nation.  Because I think he is the one of the best-bigest the value and culture brand of India. And this video or many similar videos prove that. I keep watching SRK&#39;s speeches, interviews and kind of spiritual talks. I&#39;m taking a lot of advice and learning English from his conversations. I like his speehes or hosts or his humorous persona more than his some of films. <br>I should say even now I can&#39;t understand how and why his performances in &quot;Fan and Zero Movie&quot; were not liked and appreciated. They were one of the best. You don&#39;t like or can hate movies. It is normal. But his performences and techniques he uses were like one of the best Hollywood&#39;s performences he did it I think. So I don&#39;t know...
Restlessly peaceful.<br>Put that on a T-SHIRT.
Love ShahRukhKhan ♥️
Just wake up and watching this wise Man interview great day heading towards.Rajiv Masand looking like fan girling moment with him.
Every 5th person in This world is Indian? But how
I am from La Trobe! And I met SRK.
Turn on the captions at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=970">16:10</a> 😂😂
Isn&#39;t it class of 92?? Manchester united&#39;s 92 batch.
He is an amazing speaker
God of acting..❤
Love love
You really need to work on your audio, Rajeev. It is so hard listening to your interviews.
Don 3 plz🔥🔥🔥🔥
SRK is looking so damn handsomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ufffffffffff reply me gaali diya to tumhara MKB
After seeing the content that netflix,amazon and some of these online platforms offer ,i really don&#39;t feel like going to theatres watching stupid bollywood stuff like judwa2,golmaal and so on...Srk i really really request please do a cool stuff in collaboration with netflix or amazon..For eg like sacred games , breathe amongst indian webseries...Audience has changed....Time to shift gears..No screen is small...Only one thing is big n king ..That&#39;s content.
the greatest ever
I like what srk said I will teach Abram to be King.
I think srk hardly bearing rajeef and its the first time I see srk with no contact with any one
Lots of love SRK💖💖💖💖💖
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=436">7:16</a> Ranveer singh ke liye tha ye baatein 😂🤣<br>Ab Twitter pe bawal shuru hoga 😂
Thanks to SRK, we have 1080p. 😊

Does your neck paining.  You were shaking  head like a shaking toy....  I won&#39;t Forget how u spoil good film by your poor Reviews.... i give u no ★ for such a toying type  interview.
more respect and good wishes for srk
Whenever i saw rajheev i rememberd the comment of kabir singh director..that was hilarioua
Most modest/educated person in industry
I Was Eagerly Waiting for Srk&#39;s Remake of Money Heist and he has confirmed its just a rumor... 😭😭
Please don&#39;t do shitty Rohit Shetty action films... We want real Shahrukh style ...like Don
I love you srk you are the best man in the world to me hope God bless you and your family ❤❤❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=671">11:11</a> intro seriously 😂<br>This video is clicked because of him ❣️
Fan , Chak de India and Swadesh...<br>Don series ..<br>Best of Shahrukh Khan.
He speaks from heart my heart catches those beats
he should  be in the next Dhoom film..
disliked only because I see Masand
Seriously you want to do an action movie 🤯🤯
Why such classy gentleman gives interview to shitty critics???
SRK should sign action film because it will work and it’s a better opportunity than romantic films due to his age.
Sincere, humble, genuine and real.
“ I want to do an action movie “<br>Badshah is going to make Don 3 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥<br>I hope
restlessly peacefulll

A big hand of applause Rajeev for filming this in 1080p
I love all your movies
We love you very much SRK from South America
So we can expect Don3 or may be a Dhoom4 soon
I love you
&quot;Every fifth person is Indian&quot;😂
srk is confused about his next film
King Khan
He just looks so cool, charming and charismatic. And his answers are just awesome. We want you back SRK.
Isn&#39;t he wearing too much make-up. He looks very strange
He seems really nice.
Why the Fucking hell you are wearing sunglasses...
SIR I AM UR BIGGEST FAN BUT TODAY I FEEL TOO SAD ON UR PRESENT FILM CAREER BUT I AM NOT DISSAPPOINTED BCOZ EXPERIENCE AND HARD WORK NEVER GOES IN VAIN ... AND I HAVE SEEN UR HARD WORK U PUT IN UR FILMS..... SIR , It&#39;s AN ERNEST REQUEST PLEASE IF U WANNNA DO A FILM PLEASE DO SOMETHING THAT IS OUT OF LEAK .. IF AN ACTION FILM THEN SHOULD BE HIGH OCTANE AND PLEASE DO  A VILLLANIOUS ROLE BCOZ IT SUITS U ...... GOD BLESS U SIR!!!<br><br><br>EAGERLY WAITING FOR UR ANNOUNCEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sir make some simple movies on minimum budget we don&#39;t a extravaganza every time
Love love love SRK For his wit, candor  and talent. He is and will always be an entertainer. <br><br>I saw Rajeev having a fan moment when SRK imitated him. Loved it .. 4 and a hand half. Haha
How SRK Is Talking About Action Film N Announcements N all. Getting The Vibe he May Star In dhoom 4. With Ali Abbas Zafar. As Director.
Srk <br>Making India proud all over the world
Gangs of wasseypur with srk as Faisal khan.
I admire Mr. Shahrukh like anything..always have..always will..
Time for SRK to retire...looking so old and weird..reminded me of Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan working past their due date as heroes
I enjoy watching his interviews the most out of any Bollywood actor. He’s knowledgeable and still charismatic, so the interview is always a treat to watch. Others tend to either not say anything of value or be too boring and drag things on.
He looks so old and fragile.
Srk the universal boss 😘😘😘😘
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=489">8:09</a> money hiest thing
He&#39;s GOD;conversation over
Pls Change the intro music 🙈🙈<br><br>Love your reviews and interviews ❤️
The King 👏
1080p OMG Rajeev😲
Ya SRK sir please do action film it&#39;s long time to see on screen with action dose please doo fast
He gives the best interviews in Bollywood
CHARMER OF HEARTS❤ &amp; MOST INTELLECTUAL and PHILOSIPHICAL LEGEND of Indian Cinema, he&#39;s etched in Cinema&#39;s name with GOLD... <br>SHAHRUKH KHAN
sad to hear money heist was a roumer...
I can actually listen to srk interwiew all the time. I can’t sit down and listen to any other actor interviews
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=445">7:25</a> this is about ranveer chhichora singh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgw93uaabyE&amp;t=330">5:30</a> actually he was saying about akshay kumar who is choosing film on patriotism nowadays..
Salt and pepper guy😆
Retro Badshah movie look 😎
King of Bollywood
Listening SRK is so therapeutic.
He&#39;s bst
Listening to SRK what a treat.
Just listening to this man is bliss ....U were,u r and will always be king of hearts...
please do lower budget <a href="http://movie.like/">movie.like</a> thriller movie..
Rajeev bhai kitni bar mundi hilate ho ek video me... ???  Comment below let&#39;s count😂😂
9:3 srk mouth 😂😂😂
BIGGEST MOVIE STAR ON EARTH
Would be nice if he read the script before choosing films
&quot;I&#39;m an extremist&quot;-This will be taken out of context
I am crying.! This man is so beautiful!!!<br>I love you Srk!!!!🤩<br>We want you to rule and shut up all the haters!!
King khan 👑🔥🔥🔥 I can listen to him all time ♥️
Restlessly peaceful, thats a scorpio. 😎<br>And so down to earth, thats King for us. <br>Emotional content is certainly one of the biggest USPs of bollywood. 😃<br>To just watch you speak is more than any box office record! ❤ <br>Love, ALWAYS!😘
Aren&#39;t we going to talk about those glasses?
Wasn&#39;t a big fan then, nor a hardcore one now. But this guy has brought the best of each emotion into the audience. No one can deny his excellence in charisma, personality, intensity in terms of acting. When he was doing a fan greetings type tour from Mumbai to Delhi during Raees promotions, I went to see him in Valsad and it was one of the most memorable moments. Seeing from just a few inches away just for a few seconds was heartwarming and felt like a miracle. I recorded it and is still up in my Youtube account. Thank you Shah Rukh for your contribution to the cinema industry. And please come back. We need you desperately!!!<br><br>Edit: the video of Surat Station is not mine. Just the Valsad one. 😅
Your nulgestic my love 😘😘😘srk💞💞
Vikram Vedha remake is the best for SRK if he wants to do an action movie wit damdaar dialogues.<br>He should play the villain&#39;s role in the remake.
Love all your movies and love you for ever ♥️
I think you get more knowledge into wisdom just by listening to Shahrukh Khan..
Please sign Shankar underwater sci fic movie ,
Zero wasn&#39;t that bad... Bhaijan.....
How good to see him 😊🙌🏼
Badl rajeev hindi me hi interview le liya kro interview america me koi nhi dekh rha sb indian hi hai
He is looking so old.....sad to see him deteriorating so fast...🙁🙁
He should&#39;ve removed his glares. His eyes emote so much I want to that.
To be honest SRK is one of the best actors but recently his films choices are wrong because he’s not young anymore. He needs to do more films like Dear Zindagii. You will always be King Khan &amp; Bollywood Badshah. I remember at one point, no one came even near you. This includes Salman &amp; Aamir. The amount of hits you gave is a record itself.
I don&#39;t know why I feel happy to see srk today...
5 doctorate degrees and I just have a Masters degree :(
he is just amazing
I can listen to this guy all day...
Restlessly peaceful!!
Ye mota srk ka interview lene Australia aaya h <br>But vijay raaz jase actors jo itne talented h unka interview nhi le sakta😠😠😠
I hope he does a sensible movie soon....huge srk fan❤️
All rumors put to rest ;  no money heist film
&#39;I will teach him(Abram) how to be the king&#39; 👑👑 yess you are a true king❤️❤️
Abram the next king???!!!
Only Rajkumar Hirani can save his sinking career
I don&#39;t know how is getting those awards <br>He is most overrated actor of all time
He is a Bharat Ratna ...may be award can be given once he is 80+ yrs old
Things to love about this video:<br><br>1. Mr. Masand’s great choice of questions and SRKs great way of answering them<br>2. SRKs take on letting his children create something new and also turning abram into king 😂♥️ Also, imitating Mr. Masands 4 1/2 star gestures<br>3. Overall a really wholesome feel good video
And still The King 💯
I think should take retirement now<br>Same old romantic shit drama<br>Nd trying to promote nepotism
Rajeev stuttering while interviewing srk is a MOOD
The king himself wise and calm and still a launda at 54 or 55 man how how
Love you king khan😍👑👑👑👑
King of the world😍😍❤😍
I can listen to this man till death..
One can listen to him speaking for hours and hours <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23king">#king</a>
Indirectly SRK is trying to point Ranveer Singh for being showing off his energy......I think I have much more energy than Ranveer but because he has position that he made ya because of talent but the money that his father had to offer him to survive in Bombay and some realtions ,😉
Srk sir is always being modest 😍. Rajeev you just cannot mess with srk when it comes to sports. He has great knowledge .
King of hearts SRK 💓💓💓
One of the wise person in film industry
😍😍😍I madly in love with his energy.
Srk need psycho therapist I feel
Sir BW is busy in remakes and patriotic films. Who will write a good action film 😬😬<br>&quot;Ek aur remake&quot; se fursat mile pehle kisi ko.
RANVEER SINGH KI LELI <br>WITH SIMPLICITY 😂😂
Missing Srk in Bollywood
Why do I feel like Rajeev Masand is feeling guilty. <br>We all know Zero&#39;s failure has affected SRK a lot and critics like Rajeev have played an important role in it..<br>Just thinking<br>Just thinking. May not be true.
WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAHHHH!!!  1080P????? how 😂😂😂😂
Being an ardent fan of his, I don&#39;t want to see him in films just for the heck of it.<br>I want to see him in the kinds of films because of which I admire him since I was three. The film should be memorable. That&#39;s it.<br>Take your time sir. We fans don&#39;t want collections. We just want to see you in a film which stays with us.🤗😊
Would be nice if Spielberg offered him a role in Indiana Jones 5. Maybe a supporting role in a Marvel Studios film where he can play the uncle to Dinesh Deol/Grid if they plan to adapt Grid in the MCU.
I have been hearing a lot about Shah Rukh Khan choosing his upcoming film very carefully after the failure of Zero. Definitely he should, because as a fan and as an audience I really admire SRK when he does negative roles or emotional-driven roles like Darr, Baazigar, Don 2 or Chak de India, Jab Tak hai Jaan respectively.<br><br>Shah Rukh Khan has to come back with a bang now.<br>&quot; A dethroned king, is the most dangerous&quot;
He is reading our tweets. 😭😭<br>Man he cares so much about his fans. Anyway you take your own time sir. Fans are always there for u. We love you.
Lookin forward to ur upcoming projects sir! <br><br>Big fan!
When did you start filming in 1080p?
Srk 💞💕❣💗💓💖💖💗💗💓💞💕❣💞💓💗💖
In 2017 Aishwarya Rai got Excellence in Cinema Award at IFFM. This Year SRK got the same award here at IFFM .<br>These two are the Actors who made Bollywood popular..<br>I am a proud fan of both ☺️
Keep going bro
All time favorite 😍
