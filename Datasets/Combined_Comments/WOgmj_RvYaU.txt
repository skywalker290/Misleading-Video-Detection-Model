IIT Bombay 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
damn, Nitesh is an IITian? Dangal and Chhichhore looked like Mani Ratnam classics compared to the trash of Bollywood. dropouts and &quot;influencers&quot;, please watch this man and learn. A successful director, yet completed his degree and did whatever he wanted to. Do not waste your time or your parents money.
Apun to acid hai

<b>दिखाई नहीं देता पर शामिल होता है</b><br><b>हर खुदकुशी करने वाले का कातिल जरूर होता है</b>
H4 IS LOVE NOW
This is just a sample how Sushant keep avoided from his own movies
When I saw Chhichhore on hotstar,( I didn&#39;t watch it in theater ) I decided that I will not miss any of sushant&#39;s movies coming later on. I didn&#39;t knew that I won&#39;t be able to watch his last film. May his soul rest in peace 😭😭😭
Salman didn&#39;t like SSR .....  people  who said that ....plz  watch this movie produce by Sajid ..... who is Salman&#39;s best frnd..<br>...people who blame Salman  listen I think  you don&#39;t know about Salman  any thing.....<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23farhanavlog">#FarhanaVlog</a>

RIP Sushant Singh Rajput
chhhichhore is one of my favourite   movie.This movie inspires and also give good message to public. not get awards,because of movie mafia.who responsible for his death, they&#39;ll  get punished.they will lost sleep.
People should have cared, loved and appreciated Sushant before his demise. <br>KARAN is faking through posts, T-Series showing sympathy, etc etc. They should have done it before. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Check out my edits once.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2CQzDinAlk">https://youtu.be/A2CQzDinAlk</a>

What a movie hats off
Look at Naveen polishetty in the last scene at the hospital....lol
Beautifull
Oh my God this was based on the story of true characters😮😮!! Truly appreciating, these types of movies comes 1 in decade.... (Ex- 3 Idiots) <br>.Who Agrees ??<br>Hit like👍
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23after">#After</a> 3 idiot this movie won everyone hearts ❤❤
Movie is awesome. Do watch... Btw is it a true story?
Loved the movie a lot. Great acting, <br> By every actor. (Specially varun)
Bevda is Professor at UCLA😯😯😯
It was a very good movie.<br>Could relate a lot to this film.😀😀😎😎
And they say that IITians are boring

Did anyone have a crush on Derek!!??
Best movie of 2019
What a superb movie 💕💕. <br> Student of the year 2 director should learn something before creating shit .
This is called a film<br>Not like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stoy">#Stoy</a><br>Sushant Singh Rajput nailed it<br>Oswmee picture H bhai<br>Jaroor dekhiye
What is h4?
Best movie my all time favorite now 🧘‍♂️
Great movie 👍 and another great story by nitesh tiwari .<br>I would say this movie is one step ahead of 3 idiot. 3 idiot  says to follow passion whereas  it encourages to follow it despite few failures or irrespective of result and teaches to explore outside world other than academics which is more important in enjoying  life and dealing with real life problems.
Karan johar should learn something from this....
Aree owsm 😘
Verry verry verry verry nice and best movie ....... and i like carecter sexer and mummy
Better then saaho and most of the Bollywood movies this year best story best screen play
My fav <br>Acid
I watched it. A fantastic movie with a affective story. Too much 💪 💪 entertainment than Sahoo really
CULT film of this decade...will be remembered forever, the movie has great repeat value,jitni baar marzi dekh sakte hain!! BLOCKBUSTER and Sushant Singh Rajput proved again that he is the finest of this generation!
Bahot sahi movie hai bhai yehhhh👌👌👌👌
Who came here Jst for naveen poliysheet
Hit like for Derek
Is movie ke sath insaf wahi kar sakta tha jo hostel life jiya ho, a Masterpiece from nitesh tiwari (iit bombay) alumni
Much better than saaho.. I loved it
Even the entire audience has fallen in love with Nitesh Sir..... What a brilliant movie... so realistic, apt n entertaining👏👍❤
Well done we want behind the scenes
The only movie you can watch again and again after pk and 3 idiot
So this is half scripted and half true based flim
Shraddha 😍
Bhai aaj movie dekhi masst hh yr 👌👌👌👌👏👏👏👏👏

Kamal jabardast film hai vaii...

Itsa content that should be made a web series. It was compressed due to a movie duration. The makers Should think for a web series on this script. Showing the college life of friends and reunion.
Seriously.. never had any expectations after watching the trailer.. but it&#39;s a fantastic movie.. every character has given ample time n space in the movie... 🤩🤩🤩
Best movie after 3 idiots... Relatable 💙
Chhichhore  is one of the best thing that ever happened in bollywood

What a movie really jst loved 😍
When Meena(Kota factory) entered , it is the my personal favourite seen of the movie. Well it is the nice movie with light hearted  comedy. I think shardha&#39;s role is very less but she can do better than this.
Wow it is very auto biographical...I felt that&#39;s what made it genuine... interesting
Best movie of the year
Anyone after watching movie....?
Already watched this movie 2 times..
Fresh blossom of 90&quot;s&amp; gud messaging largely to parents, of teens dealing with pressure of doing great in education.superb nitesh tiwari ji

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOgmj_RvYaU&amp;t=106">1:46</a> Acid to behind the scenes bhi Acid hi tha
दोस्तों अगर इस मूवी में आमिर खान जैसा बड़ा सितारा होता तो पब्लिक हाथों हाथ लेती , मगर यकीन मानिये मूवी बहुत बढ़िया है और मूवी  की स्टोरी डायरेक्शन बहुत उम्दा, अले दर्जे का है , मूवी को डायरेक्ट किया है दंगल फेम नितेश तिवारी ने,मूवी तो खत्म हो जाती है पर मूवी के किरदार अनी, sexa , मम्मी , एसिड , भेवड़ा, डेरेक हमारे साथ हमारे जेहन में रहते है
Movie is really awesome. Well done team.
Loved this movie 💕
