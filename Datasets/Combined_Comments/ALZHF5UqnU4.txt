Me
Mundo de mascaras !!! <br><br>Vivimos en un mundo donde la admiración se viste de odio, tú que estas leyendo este mensaje nunca permitas que los vacíos, gritos y odio de los demás afecten lo que tu llevas dentro, nunca les desees el mal, basta con lo que llevan su corazón, solo aléjate de ellos y se feliz. <br><br>No a la discriminacion<br>No al bullyng <br><br>por un mundo más humano, empático y feliz.
I remeber in kindergarten I was vibing with the boys with this fire song

I wish everyone can successfully overcome any difficulties they encounter in 2024. If you are still listening to Divine Comedy, please come and check in.🔥🔥🔥
For the 1% that read this:<br>Marshmello is such a big motivation to me, he is one of the main reasons why I started producing music and I&#39;m hoping to be as successful as him one day, it would be my dream come true. If anyone sees this comment, may you live a life full of happiness and fulfillment, and may your family be blessed with the best. Wishing you only success and may your dreams come true aswell.
I want to give you my first born son
years later and still come back to this fantastic video and track .

Day 900 of listening to Alone by Marshmello every day for a decade.<br><br>My comment misses:<br>• Day 1<br>• Day 2<br>• Day 13
last time i play this song 2018
Total banger 🤘🤫🧏‍♂️
Alguna vez me senti así ,la descripción es en la que más me representa
hauntingly beautiful melody, right? i’ve been experimenting to evoke something similar. would love your feedback on my attempt.
when this song came out i was 7 years old now im 14 years old i miss these times man why cant  i just rewind time and go back to 2016
this song&#39;s got such a feel-good vibe! aimed to bring that energy to my tracks. keen to hear if it vibes with you?
a classic vibe that’s inspired my mix too. if you’ve got a minute, i’d love for you to check it out and see what you think.
their unique style is inspiring! i’ve infused some of that vibe into my music. interested to hear your thoughts?
this song’s special, inspired my own work. keen to hear if i caught some of its magic. fancy giving my tracks a listen?
the emotional depth here is something else. tried to capture that in my music. if you have a moment, i’d love your take.
rhythm’s addictive, right? it influenced my latest tracks. if you’re into this kind of groove, my music might just hit right. feedback?
Marshmello songs I watch in movies he had the sun and the marshmallow son and then the dad open sizes room he like that song so he kisses someone on the cheek and then he would love forever
this track&#39;s a masterpiece, inspired me to push my creative boundaries. if you&#39;re up for it, i’d love to hear your thoughts on my latest.
love the vibe of this artist! tried to channel a bit into my music. worth a listen? your feedback would be gold!
the lyricism here is on another level. it’s what i aim for in my own music. got a sec to listen and compare notes?
these lyrics hit different, huh? i’m shooting for that kind of impact. would mean a lot if you’d listen to my work and share your take.
can’t get over this vibe! it’s got me inspired for my own music. keen to see if it hits the same for you. mind giving it a go?
feeling the depth here too. tried to weave that emotion into my tracks. think you could take a listen and let me know how it feels?
right? this beat is everything! inspired my latest creation. fancy checking it out and sharing your feedback?
Ohohohogohhho❤❤❤

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - In The Sky” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤️
The good old day of 2016.
Yeah this is like. Peak 2016 roblox music.
