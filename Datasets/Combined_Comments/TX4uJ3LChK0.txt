Absolutely amazing
Cant tell if the ship is flat on water one long mountain climb of ocean
The music was much needed
i once heard that seafaring is 99% boredom and 1% sheer unmitigated terror
My nephew retired from Navy after 20 years of service<br>THEY HAVE NERVES OF STEEL
Brick dust in my undies, <br>brick dust in my undies!
very nice
Did they have to add that music?
My teacher 👨‍🏫 told me to study this bruh 😒😒😒😒😒
There are things you can’t fight like acts of God. When you see the hurricane you get out of the way. But when you’re inside the shop. You can fight the hurricane and you can can win.
Some guys in wooden ships persevered, many failed.
You gotta love the music!
It&#39;s almost unbelievable what the human species is capable of doing. Instead so much of our precious time and energy is wasted on furthering the diversity of our methods to murder one another. If we are indeed alone in the universe this will truly be the biggest travesty of all time.
I bet these guys weren’t even scared
I tilt my hat to the Navy

The music is perfect.  Plodding and mournful.
After seeing that video of Arvin breaking in two I swear I can see these ships bending in the middle
Come on, not sure this is really hurricane.  No ship captain would steam his vessel into a hurricane expeciallyt since they would have plenty of time to avoid it.
No thank you.
That moment you realize even the fish are running for the deep and you&#39;re clearly out of your element
Bro it&#39;s very dangerous be careful
Imagine early people of the Micronesian islands, or any of the islands with people unique to them. They got to those islands in big canoes with outriggers, which are essentially canoes with a sidecar or another canoe attached to them dor stability. In oceans like this. Crazy isn&#39;t it? The Northmen also traversed rhe seas worldwide in smaller boats. Worldwide! Boats <del>N</del> Hoes!
Which is more dangerous? Traversing in to a typhoon or a tsunami? And why?  I am legit asking. Thanks
The Bourbon Rhode ran into the path of hurricane lorenzo last year and sank to the bottom of the atlantic, taking the captain and all 14 crew with her RIP.
Admittedly stupid question:  why sail at all when you know the hurricane is coming ?<br><br>Hell on earth : @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4uJ3LChK0&amp;t=175">2:55</a>
This has to be one of my worst fears, 🤦 just being honest
Imagine standing in front of the ship like in titanic😂🤪
I thought it would like a water tornado 🌪
Holy shit
So this is what they mean by &quot;The Ocean is very unforgiving.&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4uJ3LChK0&amp;t=28">0:28</a> thought those were crew members on the deck with reflective vests on lol
Don’t even need the scary music effect, just watching this video and imagining that you are there is enough!
i just realized thats a big ass ship and those waves are taller than it and throwing it around...
Who else is here because they clicked on the video?
The SS El Faro sank in waters similar to these back in 2015 in Hurricane Joaquin.
The toilet water when I drop a fat one:
Jesus Christ is God and He loves you! He died and rose to justify you before Himself, the True and Living Holy God, YHVH
How can I love something and be completely terrified at the same thing at the same time
pirates life is a life for me? <b>nope</b>
As a major in engineering I was wondering if anyone made accelerated purpellers  for this like this to fight against waves like this . Kinda like how jetskis are on regular waves.. think of it as a oversize jet ski and I&#39;ma invent it
Nice sound....  very well done
I can only imagine what people in those wooden boats went thru during Great 1780 Hurricane wich is estimated to have wind gust from 190-230 MPH
nope
Hard friggin’ difficult it must be to keep the ship facing into the waves when your rudder is submerged only half the time!
That&#39;s actually real?!?!?! Seems like something out of a film man!!!
Puts a lot of pressure on the hull...any cracks ~~~&gt; the end
Bravehearts
big water
I kan not belive what I am sayng but kinda miss it. Atlantic beautiful but deadly
Ocean be trippin
It always feels like the waves is going to devour the ship in any moment
The eerie background music sets the tone and makes this footage so beautifully creepy.
Captain to Irma: &quot;Can me and the crew rest for a while your center?&quot;<br>Irma: &quot;No. I don&#39;t want a boatload of seamen in my eye today&quot;
if I was out of the boat I&#39;d die
These gives me heavy anxiety.. yet I&#39;m watching them. Curiosity is the worst in situations like this lol.
That&#39;s some scary crap there! I&#39;d be in the ln the middle most part of that ship praying and probably crying like a baby!!
Hell NAH.
Big respect to those that do this for a living
Holy shit.
So is this what it feels like for a bee in a swimming pool?
Wow i like this
The cresting waves are actually blotting out the horizon, which mean the waves are at least at the same height as the camera. Steady as you go and long may you live.
Note: Irma is not the most powerful storm ever recorded
Dorian brought me here
this power can destroy
men of the earth feel that they are powerful. meet the real <a href="http://power.lol/">power.lol</a>
Much is made of this. Truth is, the captain and his crew know precisely what they&#39;re doing in such awful conditions. Obviously, all hatches must be secured. Radio positions. Turning her into the waves. She&#39;ll buck and dive and pop up, but she&#39;ll ride those giant waves like a giant surf board. Most modern ships are equipped to handle Force 10 type weather. Of course, mother nature cannot be trifled with, so every preparation is made to keep both ship and crew safe and secure. <br><br>Excellent footage🌀🌊
that is scary ,,, the sound alone 😉 As I sit in Daytona Beach waiting for Dorian to pass by ......
2020 🙋🏾‍♂️
Why sail towards the bad weather anyways? There are new precise weather tracking devices that can help ships navigates clear of storms
Fake and gay... bruh have you even seen &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; with Marky Mark?
You cut the video when it started to get good lol
HOLD ON WILSON!
Fuck that 😂
This is why you shouldn&#39;t live near the beach
Just awe inspiring and terrifying at the same time!  I can&#39;t imagine being stuck in the middle of a turbulent sea like that!
Could u I imagine that u r a navy pilot who needs to land on a aircraft carrier in this
the background score is so horrifying😨..no body is talking about this..
Yes, I’d like to order a large fuck no with a side of nah bruh
this ship dont give a fck
This real,sounds created
I worked on the ships for eight years, but we always avoided waves like these.
What if you fall into that wavy water 😵😵😵😱😱😱
To put this in perpective ever one watches crab boat nothwestern ok so we&#39;re looking at about 800 ft of boat here in view so let pretend to put 7 nothwestern at 125 ft each yea right and some wow 50 + meters esey
Dont forget to check out my latest video (Joaquin Phoenix our new heath ledger in the joker ?) Below <br>https://youtu.be/J3Z2zTpFGL0<br>Thanks for your support. 😉
That music in the background though, it felt so weird like as if I was there
Terrifying beautiful. I would enjoy going through a storm at sea if I was on a submarine build specifically for that purpose.
How the hell did that chap doing the filming get from one ship to another in that storm?!
Sailor has steel balls....
I would just vomit all over all computers until the electronic is fried 🤣 🤣<br>And at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4uJ3LChK0&amp;t=130">2:10</a> I would even shit my pants 👖and at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4uJ3LChK0&amp;t=180">3:00</a>
Omg
Imagine back in the day when people used sailing vessels and actually had to be out on deck to main the sails, rigging and helm while others worked to toss out water flooding in the hold below. Quite a number of these waves look like ship killers. At least the people here are undercover. It must have been terrifying climbing up the rigging with gale force wind and freezing rain pelting you while the ship dips and bobs about. Then you have to climb up on the yard arm and pull in a heavy canvas soaked with rain and seawater because the wind is catching at the mast and threatens to overturn the ship. And if the ship sank, you&#39;d have little to no chance for survival because there&#39;s no signal for anyone to detect, no reported locations, and no lifeboat that would last long in a violent sea.
Shit like this makes me feel real small and insignificant.
Fake, there is no hurricane.
Hardcore
Why drive into a hurricane?
Hell that is one hell of uh ride right there terrifying ride that is 🤯😲🧐😮😯..🙏!!!
I guess they&#39;re okay unless the cargo shifts, or a wave breaks over the deck and smashes in the hatches, or they suffer a structural failure.  (Or the engine dies or the steering fails...)
why is life so terrifying?
If I were On The Deck of one of those ships, id Scream in Terror, Grabbing Whatever I Can So Tight My Knuckles Turn Ghostly, Begging to be let in the ship!

Wow props the captain and crew in the first video
The last wave...
this made me want to pee
IRMA MADE IN HAARP !!!!
IRMA - MADE IN HAARP !!! FUCKING AGENDA 21 !!!
And some people be surfing hurricane waves 😂 🌊
For those moments when the engineering has to be right.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4uJ3LChK0&amp;t=86">1:26</a> it&#39;s like the movie from &quot;Perfect Storm&quot;  scene. Just need to change the ship size. The waves does not look really huge because of the ship.
This was cool...But gave me anxiety
I would not want to be out in that angry seas
I could navigate those waves in a fucking rowboat !
Really some of the best footage ever, as far as I&#39;m concerned!!<br>Probably some of the most dramatic and real clips I&#39;ve seen!!
Some of these ships aren&#39;t very large, but in these extreme storms are clearly very &quot;sea worthy.&quot;
I got sea sick just watching this.
Balls of steel
Well holy shit
thank God you maid it
Pshhhh I could swim a lap in this
Just looks like an Atlantic gale to me
I hope they are all ok from the disaster 😭 and its creepy the music give me a chills down my spine D:
as the gods of the valleys are not the gods of the hills, the gods of the lands, are not the gods of the sea
I guarantee my ass would have eaten my underwear. Or at least shit in them!
Who is watching in NC while waiting on Florence to hit??? me!!!
At the age of 12, my grandad stowed away on a ship he thought was going to the USA. He was an indentured soul in an olive orchard and he just hid on board a three masted ship; one ne was sure was going to the US. They found him not long after sailing and put him to work as a cabin boy. The bad news was that the ship went to Cuba and that was not where he wanted to go. So he signed on with tne ships crew and was a sailor for several years. He told stories of working up in the sails during storms. He said that up with the sails and the ship pitching so much, he said the ship looked absolutely tiny in all that water. I wish he was still here, I really miss him. 😢   Thank for the great video.

Can waves destroy ships or do they just move them aside like in the video? I haven&#39;t heard of a ship being snapped in half or sunk. TIA
FUCK. THAT.
would be less scary if you stopped the background music while your boating... just saying.
Why is there really spooy music??? It doesn&#39;t match what&#39;s going on in the video at all
Why is this video playing such creepy music lol
??? WTF are they even out there? This looks so scary
Perfect Storm wave at the end there.    Yeah no thank you!
What’s the begging instrumentals??? Anyone???
ถ้าเรือที่ไม่มีความทนทาน ผมว่ามันจะผ่านทะเล นรกนี้ไม่ได้หรอกครับ
Fake, the waves were paid actors
worst possible situation is to be on a plane and crush into agressive sea waves like this, i do swim a lot in the sea but to be able to swim in this weather is impossible, u will get tired in few seconds and drown there because the waves will be all over u. before even a shark will notice u lol
That vid was from 2010 lmao
I keep thinking are they gonna make it on each wave Then i laugh and say nope and i stand corrected
the weather have been to hot in 2018. prepare yourselves, i don&#39;t know were september 2018 hurricane will hit , but will be bigger them Irma. after my calculation will be born west of saint vicent and hit mexico gulf at cat5. new orleans to tampa be ready. Cancun will probably get the biggest impact ever recorded in history of modern man
You brought up the video listings. To early it ruined the last video.
Ideal conditions for Chuck Norris to hit the beach . .
Bad choice for a soundtrack. Try something else. Not spooky, annoying and distracting AF.
I realy want to go there into that sea with full storm in that ship is great and adventures i also wish to die in that storm sea with a braveheart.
Kewl...scared the ship outta me 😉
No thank you! Same goes for the music too! It&#39;s the kinda music that you hear on those messed up videos where you can&#39;t hear anything other than the music!
big wa-wa very wet.  little man go home, not sail on big scary wa-wa
Fuuuuuck that im stayin on dry land thats some scarey waves.
looked a bit like a rogue wave at the end there.
Yar ever been to sea? <br>No but I&#39;ve been blown ashore.
Made it almost to the end!!
This is November on lake Superior..
Terrifying
This belongs in a Moby Dick finale, where everything is crazy and going to hell
This is intense my God I salute you guys captaining these ships you guys are badass!!!
If you want to know how insignificant you are, try this
why would you risk a billion dollar ship and cargo estimate for this?
Music is stunning.
Very horrified hates off to persons who travelled along
Fantastic I love this video
80 ft waves i bet
This video gave me strange feelings.
Hi sweet channel ☺ Keep it up!
ah ah ! avec mon petit voilier de 10,50 m, je n&#39;ai aucune chance !<br>With my little boat 35 feet, i have no chance !
How do whales &amp; dolphins (air breathing) survive waters like this? Seems like they could drownd easily coming up at the wrong time and get a blow hole full of waves.
Wow awesome clip looks like hurricane Irma brought staggering waves in the Atlantic Ocean when it was a category 5 storm hope people didn’t get washed out to sea.🌪👍😎
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4uJ3LChK0&amp;t=184">3:04</a> OH LORD HAVE MERCY
I would shit myself, i am a landlubber and i love the eerie music/sound.
Terrible experience. Some of the waves were having height more than 25-30 m.Sailer&#39;s life is always in danger. Handling of ship in a such a position needs courage and brave heart. Thanks.
Inferno d&#39;acqua
I really love this blue planet.
Not hurricane irma
All for that overnight shipping!
cant believe how stable the ship is in such brutal and threatening conditions....
😎✌✌
nothing will happen as long as you drive perpendicular to the wave
You sir need a wheelbarrow to haul your giant balls around !!!
Imagine being stuck mid ocean in a 32 for sailboat. I did it , stories to tell
Honestly,  hurricanes are a beautiful part of nature, there almost un-natural wind speeds or there massive size. But no one on the face of the Earth can deny that hurricanes are terrifying and unstoppable
Imagine Moana in these waves... sorry girl your flat boat ain&#39;t surviving the sea.
Been there,done that.Don&#39;t do this on a boat if you don&#39;t have to.
Surfs up dudes
I think this is a music sequence of the game DOOM3, fits good to this terrific surrounding. Maybe is a monster waiting for you behind the next wave...
Gawd, but those hulls must be strong.
I am going to become an ship captain
Check out this one ..ULTIMATE Ships &amp; oil rigs in storms <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScrVMVPqu7c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScrVMVPqu7c</a>
Never underestimate the power of nature. No human being belongs here.
Incredible. It&#39;s no surprise that people used to worship the ocean in ancient times.
At least u dident die lol jk (no hate) plzzz
The scary part of the video are not the waves.............the scary part is that you know that rescue, in this weather, is absolutely impossible. In other words, if it goes wrong you know you are dead. Now that is a scary thought.
Shit. Waves like that are super dangerous. If the waves are spaced just right and they pick the bow and stern outta the water and leave the middle is suspended (hogging) it can snap the keel---especially if the ship has a shallow draft. It&#39;s what might have sank the Edmund Fitzgerald. If that happens it&#39;s all over with but the slow walking and the sad singing.
Remember, guys in tiny wooden sailing ships endured exactly these conditions and persevered.
Very very scary, not for me !
Crap...... No Hurricane irma. Just random ship compilation during stormy seas. Seen it B4 moron.
People used to travel thru this shit in wooden boats with sails...
Best way on the clip and you put your shit all over it.
I&#39;m still fixing stuff after IRMA.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4uJ3LChK0&amp;t=85">1:25</a> that wave was massive
I thought it was gonna go...
This would be both amazing and horrifying to experience in real life
Could a navy ship survive a 500ft wave?
That it&#39;s just  Amazing
Fake
No. Nope. Nada! Lol

Be aware people! after all hurricans in the caribic, all people vanished<br> in FEMA BARGES AND NEW CONCENTRATIONSCAMPS! Ireland and England have it<br> too... you need to see on yt testimonials they are shooting people in <br>the rescue shelters or directly in flooded waters after HARVEY.... the <br>euro and dollar will collapse soon and they want to occult this, buy <br>silver and gold,new word currency comes, is again goldbacked...dont <br>trust the red cross and others, the people die in puerto rico ! look for HAARP WEATHER MODIFICATION
This is not Irma footage.

awesome
اءينى&#39; الوطن العظيم لكم    هو هاذا المصير لل الوطن لكم
The size of that rogue wave at the very end...it&#39;s like twice taller tan the boat, damn. Looks like the stories about the rogue waves are true after all.
BRAVE SOULS👻
Scary!  Puts a lot of stress on hull!  Any cracks there.....down you go!
Fake - i saw this video 4 years ago
Wow. Some of them waves looked over 100 ft. Your a brave man
Not Irma, wind is probably only in the 40-60 knot range.
A freak or Rogue wave comes out of nowhere. When weather is calm.
Not freak waves. To be expected when near a hurricane or typhoon
Are these people insane? At any moment, an enormous rogue wave could leap up out of nowhere and smash the ship into kindling. A SWH wave height of 16m was recorded in the storm. A rogue wave could be 2-3 times that height, so potentially 32-48m. That could easily sink any ship. These crews are lucky to be alive.
good video
Old Video. Not Irma!
Ien care if it wasn&#39;t irma this os scary period
I would wanna be on that ship just for 5 minutes
That looks fun as fuck
Not irma, and crappy lame music. when will these tards learn...
That wave at the end....how tall do you think that was?
Clickbait. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Dont forget to check out my other videos guys!! Heres one i think you will enjoy..:)<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFQYQkijLss">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFQYQkijLss</a>
That&#39;s a Holywood production. I saw them make it in the Disney ware house. It is just half a wooden ship going up and down like a slow moving bucking bonkers machine at Coney Island.  Fire hoses spray water and the waves are on a massive screen. That is why the camera shots are always from behind.  The wind is sound affects. When they do the filming everything gets so wet the camera has it&#39;s own camera lens wiper which you can see in the final cut.
That&#39;s it! I&#39;m selling my boat!
Giant tanker in the Caribbean? What was it dropping off rum in Tortola? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fakenews">#fakenews</a>
Oh my god, the sea was really angry at the first part of the movie.
Banzai I&#39;ll go through the hurricane
Are those ships destroyed ??
A big fake ever.......thi s not Irma!!!!!!!
Yeah this is going to be one crazy hurricane... Im glad i dont live anywhere near its expected path. Great video by the way :)
Is the corny, &quot;spooky&quot; music really needed? Ruined it for me.
It&#39;s not the most powerful storm ever recorded.
