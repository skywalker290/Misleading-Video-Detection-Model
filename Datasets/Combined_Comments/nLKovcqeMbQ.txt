CATALONIA IS NOT SPAIN
EXCELLENT !  now every region inside catalonia, declare independence from catalonia also.
wow so many ppl and nobody in the EU speaks about it... but if there are 100ppl  in Kiew protesting against Putin, the EU dictators immediately tell us that Ukraine is suffering from Russia and new sanctions on Russia have to be applied. What a joke democracy. The EU is an empire which has to be stopped and destroyed by the people.
Cataluna es Espana
The European Union is tearing Europe apart!
EU de puta free Catalonia..
Who benefits from breaking countries apart? Certainly not the people.
Catalonia is different!!! Go!! Good citizens!!!

Be United Spain. <br>The stance- &quot;free Catalonia &quot; is coming from spouters of leftist ideas. Thats what lefts do, they divide and tore down many countries.

The rich control the world. The poor are expendable.
One day Jesus was walking in a park. A young man came to him and said, &#39;Lord, I am Catalan and wish for my country to be independent from Spain&#39;. Jesus said, &#39;who is the current leader of Spain?&#39; The young man replied, &#39;Rajoy&#39;. To which Jesus said, &#39;It is right that you say Rajoy is the leader of Spain, for Spain has no leader.&#39; Your country is already free and independent. Now go up to Parc Gaudi and give a lost tourist directions to his hostel.&#39; The young man left Jesus, filled with joy and praising God in Catalan as he made his way to the metro station.
Independence now!<br>Viva the Sovereign Republic of Catalonia!
Meanwhile in Venezuela, the US regime is calling for government change while in Spain, they have nothing to say. Fucking hypocrites...
WW3 is coming in the next 5-30 years. The pressure is building all over the world; for all sorts of different political grievances. Once the first domino goes the rest will fall in sequence.
BRAVO , that&#39;s how it is done.
Curious dilemma.  Who wants centralised govt? So what are we afraid of?
Viva la revolución.
viva Catalonia, mariano rajoy is a cunt.
Jesus why did the Spanish Central Government send the Police. Are they retarded. They should have sent the Police to Protect the People voting and then make some small concessions and be over it. But they overreacted and now people are furious.
Fuck Catalunya - you can&#39;t have independence until Crimea and the Donbass officially get theirs, why should <b>you</b> be a special case ?
Independence is not going to change anything there, Catalonia will continue to be ruled by bourgeoisie. Catalans are being influenced and manipulated by zionist media, the only true change can not come from politicians who have ruled Catalonia for the last three decades.
Visca  Catalunya  INDEPENDENT || *||
That is a fucking <b>beautiful</b> sight to see, the people of Catalan people coming out united to say they will not be beaten by government thugs, they will have their say and be heard. Much love from the UK.<br>MSM probably reported it as a couple of thousand lol.

Best thing to do is with hold sending money to Spain . That&#39;s all that Spain wants. And  have the  United Nations pass a resolution  ordering mediation .
People forget Spain has a king and is a constitutional monarchy
Spain is doing wrong to the&quot; Catalonians  a crimen&quot;  for humanity
I see millions
that&#39;s more than thousands
Malcontents without jobs.
This will just be ignored like everything else you&#39;ve done. At some point, it&#39;s time to break out the guns. I mean you voiced your protest and you were ignored. You voted and it was rejected as illegit. You&#39;ve been physically and verbally attacked and abused... I mean at some point it&#39;s time...

Hasala Visca Cathlunya
I just want to make sure I understand this proper? So Spain joins the European Union, relinquishes it&#39;s sovereignty, banks, borders, businesses, laws, courts, currency, etc, etc, etc, to a foreign union located in a foreign country, i.e.European Union. Catalan, wishes to break away from Spain so that it can join the European Union so that it can be free and independent. Really?
I want to be happy about this, but aren&#39;t they pro-EU communists?
This is shit, of Course the rest of Spain, the people should vote As well, its their country to. Shouldnt they have a vote IF their country should be divided??? Fuck catalan go to hell
VIVA Spain
If catalunya will leave europe will be full of seperatist small countries despite of france and maybe germany

true orange! god bless Crimea and Catalunia
European oppressors
I&#39;m so proud of you Catalonia!!
This is gonna snow all against EU imo
Soros Paid lefties
Spain out the EU and Catalonia in the EU, force against vote must be punished.
Dream on! What they&#39;re after won&#39;t make the slightest difference. They&#39;ll end up as another insignificant region dangling on the arse end of Europe with no power and serving paella to tourists, just like they&#39;ve always done. Their &#39;revolution&#39; is nothing. It is demanding no change except a different flag, and that new flag will have to fly lower than the EU flag.
Catalonia Adelante viva
The Catalan vote for independence is deemed illegal by Spain and the EU. BAREXIT ain&#39;t gonna happen folks.
Even though my President was coerced (in my opinion) to side with Spain, there are millions around the world and in America too, who are cheering the brave and noble Catalonian people. Don&#39;t forget: &quot;First they ignore you, then they mock you, then they attack you, and then you WIN.&quot; - Ghandi. It may not be easy, but victory is clearly close at hand. Better to die on your feet, than to live on your knees. Viva Catalonia.
Free Catalunya.<br>Fuck off Rajoy and Spain
Proud Spaniards showing the world how it&#39;s done. So much respect.
This is what democracy looks like! (stealing the slogan from the wackadoos for antifa) 😁
Just goes to show how many irrational people there are in the world. Whilst intelligent people seek peace through unity others seek to keep the world divided in a never ending history of nationalist wars and power struggles that have killed hundreds of millions already.
