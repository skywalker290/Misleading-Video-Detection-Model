Another double B ( BB - bambam) sang a song just like your music video. Guys go and check bambam thai singer ost of &#39; I am not a con-heartiest&#39;. <br>I think that music video is inspired from this song🇮🇳.
MV of a Thai movie ost song is quite similar with this MV. Thai MV is inspired by BB&#39;s MV😍.
