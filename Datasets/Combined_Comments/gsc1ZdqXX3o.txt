I&#39;m of a dark complexion, my family doesn&#39;t mind it, but i do mind it very much. No matter how much people say that they aren&#39;t racist, but most people judge people by their skin colour, this is the sad reality of today 😭

Agar khud ka dimag sahi hai na <br><br>age koi bhi ho mature hone ki age n hoti agar samjhdari h to galt chizo or logo ke sath rahegye hi nhi..<br><br>Or agar unko ye sach  na pta ho ki jo unke sth h vo glt hai ..<br><br>Par itna samjh hai ki kya galat hai kya nhi ...<br>.vo log eshi chize  dusro k sth nhi kregye.<br><br>I hate fb i just use insta to help ppl  jinke sath discriminate hora h or depress h log nd also bcz of my Artwork.<br><br>Nd i met  some amazingg ppl who rrally r blessings  good pure heart .. Chahe vo india se h ya other country se.<br><br>They also help a lot  to build my confidence <br>.to logo ko samjhna or khud ko bhi samjhna sikhna acha hota hai.<br><br><br>Aur jo apko chu samjhe usssse bada to koi bhi chu nhi hai.<br><br>Mene to family ko bhi samjhadeti hu jb bhi mere samne koi discriminate wale baate hoti hai ..<br><br>Chahe vo religion ka ho cast color ho  love ho jo b .<br><br>Jabar dasti ka yaha log church alg alg bs templ new new gods arhe hai bas.

I always gone through this situations depressed so many times but now I always remember one thing that who&#39;s talking about me anything bad it&#39;s his/her thoughts.. and being alone is better than friends like this.. so I&#39;m happy 😊
Bhuvan Bhai, once I was traveling in a train with my parents and there were trans standing in front of me and in my mind, I said who are these people, why are they dressed like this and all of that, now I realize that I was wrong and that I should not judge someone
India is the most racist country
<b>Indians are very self hating people so I avoid them. I&#39;ve suffered a lot of REVERSE DISCRIMINATION.</b>
<b>Europhilia.</b>
That&#39;s why we like him ❤❤👏👏 hats off to him
Proud of you Bhuvan .😊
BRO IM A CHILD
Im not being bullied by skin colour but being bullied because im fat and still its going on 😔
Bb mujhe Bachpan mein ghar mein sab Kaliya bulate the
Bhuvan Bro ❤️
You are so intelligent 👍🏻❤️
Hi bro
When I was in 8th standard my Geography teacher humiliated me  for my darker skin tone.<br>She was was talking about  how South Indian  Tamilians are dark skinned  and immediately pointed towards me in front of the whole class and said (&quot;Look that boy is an example of a south Indian&quot;)<br>I was just 13 at that time I felt insecure at that moment  all my friends were laughing at me it shattered my self esteem.<br>Except this incident  my classmates already used to make fun of me and look down on me .<br>Those regular mockery and insults during my childhood made me an introvert and less confident , social person .<br>Now I am  20 year old and  still my communication skills aren&#39;t good  I don&#39;t have any friends and  I get bullied daily in my College .
Jo log languages k base pe logon ko judge krtay hai vo mujhe bilkul bhi achay nhi lgtay.
Medias ka kam hi hai logo ka brain wash karna.....<br>Bina waja ki breaking news banake &#39;&#39;popularity&#39;&#39; karna chahte hai apna....😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡<br>Don&#39;t listen to media.....always listen to those who gives you right informations like bb bhai....
Now I am knowing the real BB 🙂💙
Ap jaysa v ho bohot accha ho bb i love you 💓
Why is this video not being recommended? 😠😠
No words for BB&#39;s talent. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hello
Hello
Real  viewers are hare in this good videos of BB
This is indeed True I have seen many couples where one is obese and other fit<br>One with dusky complexion and other with fair and there are many more comparisons that comment section will turn small for this.<br>So here if the woman is having any of this societies so called negative traits then that couple life becomes hell, and sometimes because of this f*cking so called society their marriage comes to an end
Hlo brother
He is talented g.o.a.t

If any fair complexion person come and tells me that my skin is not fare, I would tell them if you believe that God made us, then he forgot to add colour while he made you.<br><br>No offense but if someone passes racist comments to me, I will have to fight for my self, only by my voice.

Maine 4 saal pehle.... Ek ladke ko uske dusky color k kaaran accept nahi kiya tha.... Mai single thi or pehle kabhi koi relation mai nahi thi.. Wo pehla ek ladka tha jisne mera bht peecha kiya.... Bohot efforts lagaye lekin mera mind set ye tha ki mai kisi handsome ya cool bande k saath meri first relationship enjoy karu.... Lekin mujhe uss ladke ne kisi ka hone nahi diya.... Uska pyaar or lagaataar efforts ne use aaj mera fiance bana diya.... Love u shekhar🥰🥰tumne mujhe pyaar ki real meaning realize karwayi

Bhai video ka thumbnail edit ker ke zyada ideas ager nahi aa raha hai toh aap ye sunneye. Aap woh bund room se bahar jao. Naya v log videos ko chalu karo. Tub aap ko ideas milega or ye garentee hai.

Meaning that u definitely want to go out. All ur doing is changing the time clock of the brain. Bb bhai I am waiting for ur next video ❤️ly

Jusy putting a thing that &quot;bas jo political connected log hote h woh kaafi jaada try krte h ke hum logo ke unity ko break karke political gain kr ske&quot; aaj ke he baat h ek bhaiya ne aaj daala tha ke &quot;gaaye (cow) ko roti khilane wale logo ke dosti kabhi,gaaye ko roti k sath khane walo se nhi ho skte&quot; that&#39;s totally wrong and he is just 18 and have a thinking of such a low mentality person,not all the people eat beef and in some way it&#39;s their choice
Jaise japan le log sirf apni mother tough mein hi baat karte hai

Whenever i see someone making fun of colour or caste or figure , I always stood against that but what I get in reply is that &quot;Jyada gyan mt c**d&quot; 🤷🏻‍♀️
Bhai aap maanoge nhi main apne aap se yhi baat karta hun, ki hindi itni underrated aur underappreciated kyun hai
Some of my friends call me kaalu, for my dusky colour....<br>But the worst thing is, I&#39;m fat + black<br>Even new people laugh at me sometimes....<br>Some of them pass comments like:- kaala genda, bhess🙃....<br>But atleast I&#39;m happy &#39;coz I transformed myself last year and I reduced my weight from 84kg to 66kg...<br>Now They don&#39;t call me motu...but I&#39;m still kaalu for them!😵

You are awesome Bhai, ek Dil hai kitni baar jeethoge❤️.. <br>you had put clear picture of our society, your words might effect the thinking of our society. Good start Bhai, do these things frequently.
And  we  don&#39;t  care  what  they  think  of  us  as  these  things  signify  their    personality   and God looks  everything  as  I  am northeast
Bro  your  words   touched  by  soul  and  we  face  these  problem  still  .people  still  stare  us  too  much  and  make  us  realize that  we  are  not  like  them  and  thanks  for  talking  in  this  topic  🙏🙏🙏
😭 we are discriminated in Goa on basis from where we have come were we were born religion yar please don&#39;t hesitate to stand up for your rights <br>The sad truth of Goa is discrimination of Indian tourist 😭
Ha bhai shi kha
Im not obsessed with fair skin.... But in obsessed with clear skin not matter how skin color is😭😭😭😭
My mom says not to buy a black dress cause im dark so i wouldn&#39;t <br>look good. My sister is fair like my mom and i am like my dad it makes me feel sad tho-
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsc1ZdqXX3o&amp;t=136">2:16</a><br>This u must find something small, but discouraging someone continuously for a fat body is very painful<br>Even the teachers do body shaming, I hate this<br>Nobody should care about, how I look, what is my current bg,<br>I need  this to be stopped, cuz I don&#39;t spend there money, there money is not used to make me fat, so shut the f up<br>and also, not related to me<br>But those who think that being transgender, gay, lesbian, or any other person who come in the category of LGBTQIA+ is something very offensive, change ur thoughts until it&#39;s too late, and I would like to thank and appreciate Bhuvan sur for bringing social topics in ur videos also, I respect the society but not there stupid rules and limitations which discriminate others<br>Thanks
Love u BB for this vdo
Can we plz respect that BB steamed 26 Minutes only with his right hand<br><br>Me tries that: &quot;phone hit the face too hard&quot; <br><br><br>&quot;&quot;Minecraft music noises&quot;&quot;

Thanks Bhuvan...for inspiring all people like me who have dusky skin...and to teach a lesson to those people who makes fun of us. Hope, from the next time..after watching ur video..ye hamare sath kabhi nahi hoga and if ho jaye to we have to understand ke wo log bewakoof hain.... And one thing to say...that I automatically had a smile on my face after watching this video........❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Loads of love and respect to u Bhuvan bhaiya..
This is the least viewed video of bb
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Who is here in 2021 ????????
From this <br>to the brand ambassador of myntra <br><br>This called struggle and success
This the reason why I love Bhuvan
I have dark complexion but not too dark only few guys made fun of me.<br>There was an hindi story in my school called Kallu Kumhar after then they named in Kallu. But I never mind because they were my friends and i could also make fun of them. But if some elder or relative make fun of color thats bad. It never happened to me.

Instagram ,Facebook,Twitter se badiya game khello
Amazing video sir
3 saal pehle hi pata chal gaya tha ki isko corona hoga in 2020
The quality is best
this guy is an true inspiration love you soo much big fan.
I am puzzled as to why is it racist to call a Black Guy Black but calling a White guy White isn&#39;t..???
Tabiyat kaisi hai aapki
Bhai bahut acchi lagi baten saree bahut badhiya very good Har Kisi Ki Yahi Soch honi chahie
Recommend after 3 years
I have a Muslim frnd and he very kind person.<br>But actually the truth is k kisi ek person k vajah se Puri com Ko shayad bhura mana Jata h. Bus log sunte h or yakin kar lete h that sit baki sach to ye h ki sab log Badal re h or miljhul k rehte so bus kuch logo k vajah se kuch khrab soch kuch logo ki uski vajah se sab log ESA soch te h
Surely, this guy has got something. You are made to achieve something more than what you already have had.<br><br>I just know one thing. Only a few people cannot actually make a difference in this Racistic view with which Indians judge everyone.<br>Chahe kitni bhi Western movies dekh lein.. dimaag aaj bhi peeche h aur mujhe toh lgta h future me bhi peeche hi rahega.<br>And hence, the best thing about outsiders(people outside of India-non Indians), like MCU-DC movie producers, actors, co-actors, they don&#39;t fucking care about if the person working with them is brunette, blonde, or even warm brunette. Why can we not move ahead of this racism, guys!?<br>Some Asians think that skin color describes person&#39;s status and background, as per what I have read.. mtlb kisaan ka baccha gira hoga toh kya wo kisaan ka baccha nhi hoga. Aur Ambani ko toh jante hi nahi honge ye log. <br><br>Aur English se toh hadd ka obsession h.. mtlb ek ne boli nahi to bol denge English nhi aati kya.. fir angrezi me baat krein toh.. apne aap ko jyada oversmart ban rhi ho.. SAHI HAI MTLB.<br>So, this is a basic thing jo hum tak bhi humare parents se hi aati h.. agr tum badalna chahte ho toh bdlo na yrr.. Where IS the problem!?<br>Haan, and i would even say I&#39;m an Indian, and I have got no problem agr log mujhe Priya Prakash Varrier aur Zendaya se compare krte hn.. han yrr me wesi dikhti hu to kya.. DIKKAT KAHAN H!?🙆‍♀️🧏‍♀️<br><br>And yep, I don&#39;t fucking need likes.. kahan le jaungi rkh kr.. thoughts likhne ka shauk h bas mann kiya likh di.
These are the reasons why India is still considered as a developing country....not a developed country
Dil Jeet liya yaar apne ...aap best ho..

right bro🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍
I started watching your videos 15 days before...becoz I was little upset with my life.. though thoda mood change karte hain... but day by day...I felt that you are not only a you Tuber but also a great personality with broad vision...so keep on watching about you.. about your tours.. about your programs etc..I can see you will be a great personality...to whom people can proud..And I am the first one...I feel proud that we have a youth in India like YOU.... like BHUVAN... love you..
&quot;Jo insan mazhab/dharam ki base per discrimination ya extremism phelata he wo na to muslim he na hindu ,christian etc,wo sirf aik extremist he .Me aik muslim hun and its a releif from me to hear from someone the TRUTH .Muslims and Hindus have been living in the subcontinent for centuries and celebrating each others&#39; rites and relegious activities. India is a great democracy no doubt and its a fact k ladai musalmono aur hindus ki nai he .kuch agencies he jo apna matlab nikalne k lie religion card play kar rhe hn and most of the people are aware from it .<br>I hope that extremism in every shape should be condemned by everyone whether its class discrimination or communal voilence.
Bhai Corona houa ha kiya <br>sorry BHUBAN
At the time we go to school with the knowledge we also learn racism. And we learn this not from our friends but from our teachers only

Hi bhuvan i m frm northeast Assam n i love ur videos...
Bro please get  once again live please 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Most of the things you said are so normalized in our culture and we hear it so much as kids that we accept it without realizing how wrong it is. Rightly said that as adults we can change it and correct our ways...
When i was a child i had dark complexion and got many taunts from only family. They didnt even want to play with me
I have a tanned complexion. I had a friend who&#39;s basically a piece of shit in school,she said to me that my complexion is not good and she&#39;s fair as hell though she was just 2 shades lighter than me.
Khne ka bda  mn hota h ye...pr sb pgl h... smjhte hi nhi h...
Mi pn Marathi...plz ek video marathit bnva🙏🙏🙏
Okay so I don&#39;t know if the comments are still active or not but here my story :<br>One time I was having my lunch and he said,&quot; there is no one in this house who&#39;s black like you ! &quot; <br><br>Another time this happened . It happened at my grandparents house. My cousins literally compared perticularly my skin colour to theirs.<br><br>What you read in the first para , it&#39;s actually my dad , just so you all know.
Ka apka  satha  mit  kar saktha  hi sir
Who else is watching this when fair and lovely change the name to glow and lovely because of discrimination
North Eastern dark skinned girl hima das is now proud of India, world champion
MY brother also teasing me for my face colour because he have bright colour and i have black colour <br>       And he teasing me &quot;pig&quot; <br>I also agree with you
You are a great guy. More than a comedian . Love you ♥️.

India is a country which has lots of obsession factors....on basis of skin colour, caste, culture, language....<br><br>And we think that we could be Super Power one day. but i don&#39;t think so it would appear if we&#39;d still obsessed.<br><br>This is sad but truth fucking reality.
So true I don&#39;t know why but I started sobbing prior to watching this video (only by seeing the title ) just becoz that&#39;s so much relatable to me . I was always bullied during my childhood  as kaali bhoot , chudail , kali kaluti , u don&#39;t look gud in light colours..  My world was just confined to me being an introvert which was rooted to inferiority complex consequently arised from what society threw upon me . Bt now I just contemplate why do u even have to give a shit to people they always have n will continue to disregard u so Live according to ur wishes n boom i wear every possible colour.. never apply our so called discriminatory cream fair n lovely . I feel confident more than before n lovely myself ☺️💁🏾‍♀️
whose watching this in 2020
Love you dada 💖
ever applicable video nothing has changed over the years and will never change.
Yes
Ues
Mae ek brown girl hun aur mene bahut discrimination face kiya hae😭😭😭
1 number bhai bahot hi Sahi h
Today I am remembering this video<br>When the whole world is acknowledging for black lives which you asked our people to follow way before😊😊.
U have the guts to discuss abt real things which other social media influencers try to avoid fearing losing subscribers or consider them not appealing to their group of subscribers. Ur responsible attitude made me subscribe ur channel today😊. Ur honesty reflects in ur eyes!! Much respect bro and bestest of luck for ur career!!
Hi
I have fair complexion but I think complexion is not matter <br>Your way of talking,mindset, intelligence,behave and treat nicely with othets and so on. These things matter alot in any person male or female <br>Need to change mindset related to skin complexion
Bhai body shaming pe bhi bole
Bhai but dusre desh bhi koi sudhre hue nahi h. US mein to weight ko leke bahot mazaak udate h. N ageing ko lekr bhi. Sb bakwas h.
If only everyone becomes like him.

sir ap bth acha samjhate ho...I am really inspired by your words...nd always I watch this vedio  nd also show everyone
Guess what, mere bade Bhai ne 2 saal pehle hi live aake bol Diya tha &quot;Please no racism&quot;
All of this is so true. Its high time that we stop discrimating people on the way they look, their religions and start appreciating the inner person. It&#39;s the youth which has the power to stop all this bullshit and also its our responsibility that we stop people who are bullshitting stuff then and there because these petit things like teasing lead to big and severe mental issues.  If each one of does their own part of not discriminating and stopping the people who are discrimating we can surely get through this and pave our way towards the actual development!!!

But it&#39;s more in North states like Delhi Yaha aapse face Dekh Kar bat ki jaati hai. But yes I live in East Delhi from approx. 24 years &amp; Yaha Sab Tarah ke community ke log hai lekin ESA unsafe Kabhi ni lga
This thinking can&#39;t be changed it&#39;s just come naturally from within you ki aap is Tarah se judge na Kare Kisi ko bhi it&#39;s take some time to understand anybody so don&#39;t make it a priority ki vo Acha ni dikhta to vo Acha ni h

Hi bb tum na mera nam lelo my name is mayukh
Bekar quality
Iam a Muslim and iam a big fan of you
I have been directly or indirectly targeted for the way I look as it does  not fit the &quot;societal beauty standards&quot;. But the worst of all happened in college. I have been a very studious student, always having good grades but once in my college,  there was a research paper project, we had to work under a proffersor, my topic and the initial work that I had done was better than the rest participants but still the HOD of our department selected another girl because she was fair and beautiful than me(and my HOD was obsessed with fair skin). Though I worked under another proffersor and won the competition for my class but still that incident was the most piercing because my academics were the only thing I was never judged for the way I look, my brain and my thoughts represented me. But that day it hurt me so much.

Itna bhi achaa nahi hain but chalta hain video quality

Bhagwaan Krishna bhi dark the.<br>Raat ke andhere mein hum sab dark hain.<br><br>Aur kya chahiye? To all who discriminate people on skin colour which is as normal as us drinking water, ABBEY SAALE!!!
मेरे पास भी बिल्कुल आपके जैसा तकिया है।
Wow! There are Indian BOYS also who are upset with the fair skinned boy obsession and here I am.I have taken far too much shit from darker skinned(especially caramel skinned) Indian boys,tolerated their rudeness etc. only because I long for tan skinned guys over pale guys 🤷🏻‍♀️
Please share my story that my classmates played a game which was Sameer Touch in who I was treated as a untouchable and now I am suffering from depression can you advise a sollution

And you kept speaking Hindi... <br>And trust me, you really looked and behaved in a far more better way than the Bollywood actor Aditya Roy Kapoor.. <br>&quot;Originality is always beautiful&quot; you proved it .. <br>God bless you ..💝😊
Baat mein dum hain
❤️❤️❤️
This video is so relevant even today. What you said from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsc1ZdqXX3o&amp;t=558">9:18</a> is what is going on right now. More power to you!
4.1K dislikes kisne kiya bhai..... 😔😔😔😔
Hii bb
one day i remmered that my behavior with was good  with teacher but some time teacher
Low quality hai
Bhai mai goora hu isliye mujhe angrage bulate
poorwaj were not bewakoof............you are not right there......mana unka nazariya galat tha ,and they were not developed as we are today ..but we should respect them because aj ham jo bhi hai unki badolat hai..<br>otherwise, bb you are superb ...keep it up bro...
It might be mainly people of around 27 and above who discriminate so then <br>maybe in 2040 discrimination will be almost eradicated<br>hope this is true
Ap ne bhot theek bola me so ke saat hu
Bhuvan let me share with you what i think causes people to think this way on subconscious level. <br>When you play will you choose a fat one? Most probably not. Why? Cause u hate him? No.   Cause you know fat is unhealthy. That fat person will not be able to run as well. So wo banda to reh gya na hamesha ke liye disqualified?  Tell me how to change this cause i don&#39;t  know how. People will want to win always and they cannot by choosing fat people. They need fit people who will win them trophy.  Can you see the trap?   Toh kya karein? Khelna bandh kar de?<br>When you stay outside and work under the sun it&#39;s  only natural that your skin will be dark. So it&#39;s  natural to assume  that fair skin means he comes from a good background, wealthy family.  Right?  <br>I understand that hating and making fun for this simple  thingz is backward thinking.  I try my best to avoid doing this to anyone. <br>But mein aap se puchta hu aap keise expect kar sakhte ho ke ye saab baandh ho jaye?    Agar healthy rehna sahi hein to log to healthy and good looking people hi first choose karenge na? Is ko hum galat keise bole batao?  Aur jab wo mota kala banda first look me reject ho gaya to harbar to wo looser hi huwa na?    Is mein aap keise isko galat bologe batao?   <br>Change to tabhi ayega jab hum ise jhar se tor saake? Warna ye sirf kitabo mein hi sahi hein. Hum aur aap kuch nehi badal sakhte.
He is a true influencer...hats off❤👌👌
Haye kisi ki nazar naa laga mera bhai ko❤️❤️❤️😘😘

Bhai BB tujhe hum logka fair skin ko leke itna chinta hai toh khudki ke liye ek gora gf kiyou nhi dhound leta. Pasand karega kya
Very nice topic sir.<br>When I was in 12 in previous year I had experience one problem which I think is everywhere is that if someone is  paying for anything then we are overusing that thing. For ex. in school many classmates leave all the fan open and leave the tap water running when they are not in use. Because they think that they are paying for it.
Dislike karne wale sab wohe cutiya hai
But, one more thing, you know Americans stereotype Indians in a particular. Many of them think all Indians are Hindus and vegan.
You look like my boyfriend i can&#39;t stop staring at you in shoock 🤧🤣❤
We love you BB !☺️
👍👍👍👍👍

Kash sb ki thinking ap ke jesi hoti BB I am proud of you
I&#39;m from Northeast India and thank you so much BB for highlighting discriminal facts about us. We face this problem a lot and I think your channel is a great platform to showcase discriminal, racial and other bizarre issues. Once again, Thank you so much ❤
Okay, I watched this video till the end and I totally agree with BB, but something that I wish to point out is the existence of discrimination on the basis of Religion/Castes. Yes, they do exist and on a larger basis than what is shown in Medias of any sort. But in different forms. They won&#39;t come at you directly abusing you for your caste or religion, but at some point in time, they definitely will blame you, take a jab at you for all the problems. These problems are COMMON even TODAY in almost every goddamn village of India. And if there are people who might see this comment of mine and say &#39;wo to villages ki problem hai; waha ke to log itne educated hai nhi&#39; to lemme tell you, India is made up of villages. Villages, rural community, even if don&#39;t accept it, are the life and blood of this nation. So my point-yes, these discriminations do happen, in a manner not visible to every eye. And I&#39;m not favouring these incidents in any way; nope. But we keep turning a blind eye to the minimal form of these problems, it won&#39;t be a long time when they lead to us wars among ourselves.
Love you 3000
Ap kaha rhte ho ap mere aap mere favourite Ho
Hiii mujhe bachpan se lekar aaaj tak skin colour ko lekar bahut hi jyada comment sunne mile h kyunki main sawli hun,bachpan mein toh mujhe yeh samajh hi nahi aaata tha k kuch teacher mere saath aisa ajeeeb behave kyun karte h jaise 45 min mujhe khada rakhna aur mujh se meri di ka comparison  karna aur daaantna kyunki di mujh se gori thi, 1 classs ki bachi ko(mujhe)kaaali ma bolna ,jab ki main toh top karti hun class mein phir dheere dheere samajh aaane laga ke yeh behaviour mere complexion ke wajah se hota h bahut hi chirchiri si ho gayi hun main maine fair hone ki bhi bahut koshish ki but jaisa ki aaap ne kahan complexion kabhi nahi change hota main ab bhi sawli hun basss ab antar yeh h k sab meri beauty ko dusky beauty kehte h aaaj sab meri tarif karte h ke kitni beautiful h ladki lekin aaaj bhi ek sentence mere tarif mein lag hi jata h k agar yeh gori hoti toh kya lagti yeh ,main apne liye aur apne complexion ka jab bhi koi mazak udata h toh ab stand leti hun aur saamne wale ko tok deti hun lekin kuchhh log khud hi apne complexion ka mazak banate h unke mind ko main kaise change karun yeh mujhe aaaj tak samajh nahi aaaya...
Hi
Bhai thake hui lag rahe ho
I am a Muslim. In our religion we are taught equality, not abusing, not killing, not stealing, not allowed to tease neighbours in any way, no alcohol. We are taught to be good with everyone. We are united.

Sir Just to correct you , hamare purvaj bevkoof nahi the balki KUCH purvaj bevkoof the , My grandfather and great grandfather instead of being  Brahmin never discriminated anyone and that&#39;s what I was tought in home ,school and any religious book which I learnt so far , so my humble request to you 🙏🙏🙏is instead of abusing all our ancestors as bevkoof just say some of them<br>And I know u didn&#39;t mean to say this it was uttered in flow , so don&#39;t think I hate u or I don&#39;t agree with what you said , it&#39;s just a reminder to u that you have crores of followers , who admire u and follow u and they must not misconcieve  that our ancestors was&quot;  bevkoof &quot; we have tons of good teaching given by our ancestors which we all must admire
Bhuvan sir, acchi cheeje koi share ni krta baki faltu stuff sb share krte h. Bt i will share it. Apse hm english ki vocabs seekhte h. Thank you

Our country India has the biggest English speaking population in the world although our national language is Hindi. Indians are in so much complex of defining standards by English speaking and all of is are suffering from inferiority complex and are embarrassed to speak hindi among our &quot;modern mentality wale bharwe friends&quot;

Agar koi kisi ko kaala bolta h toh bbut bura lgta h lkin agar koi gora bolta h tb kyu nhi bura lgta...hmare perceptions hi bhut galat..haa log kaale bbi hote or log gore bhi hote or log kaale bhi hote or aap jo bhi ho u should be proud of what god has given you ..cuz everyone is unique ..jinko kala bola jaata h unko bura kyu lgtaa h ...agar aapko bura lgta h toh aap hi kaale rang ko ugliness se associate krte ho ya aapko khud apna color pasand nhi..is society me har tarah k log hote h or aesa kbhi ho hinhi skta ki koi bhi aapko kisi chiz k liyr tease na kare lkin agar aapko unke khne se bura lgra h toh khi na khi aap bhi vhi feel krte ho..jo bhi yaha jiska color brown h ya black mai un log se khna chAhti hu ki aaap ko khud sochna h ..kaale or gore me koi fark nhi hota dono barabar gore hone se koi  beautiful nhi hota or kaale hone se koi ugly nhi hota...i hope ..u got my point.<br>Thankyou
yes   moti....🤗🤗🤣🤣
hi..
Ha log kale pan ka mazak bana te he
college time me kisi kaale ko Dekh k ek comment- vo dekh fair &amp; lovely ka maalik aa rha hai.😂😂..but ab lgta h ki  insaan ka rang  nhi, uski soch, uska Dil saaf hona chahiye.
👏👏👏👏👏

I love my muslim friend<br><br>Our school bus passed through a mosque and a mandir but i did&#39;nt &quot; pranam&quot; towards  mosque but i saw my friend seeing me and he also went to a mandir with me , so the discrimination which exist is done by us, we people and we can only stop it!!<br><br>Who agree with me and like bb ki vines, give like!!
Who love BB like thoko!!
I just want to meet u and give u aaaaaa tight hug such a osm person u r
See I am not saying that I am nice and all but when I was 5 and now also I never treated people like this ki that she is black stay away from her...I don&#39;t know why people r believing this all I am why
Pls read this message ...U know I was bullied a lot when I was in 1or 2 class and   my family thought isko koi lakme ki creme LA do gori ho jayegi but if we actually see people with dusky or dull colour they r much much much much beautiful than white people. Beauty and fair skin colour doesn&#39;t matter in ur life but when u have correct values inside that matters.....
Zarurat se zyada ki achxi soch hai i like u .. Love u ..
What a wonderful thoughts 🤗🤗🤗 Wowwwww. Bb you are 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩

BB I am facing many problems in my school due to my skin tone. My friends used to give me some inappropriate names like - Kaalu, Kala kawua, Kale hatthi. This is very depressing and annoying. I love your topic of this video.  🧒🏽🧒🏽🧒🏽
All is best
I feel bad when literate ppl even from very high grade colleges also ,boys &amp; girls are so much obsessed with &quot;white skin&quot;. Even education couldnt erase this thinking from their blocked mindset.
