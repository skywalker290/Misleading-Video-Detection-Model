I was so confused why Han was in this movie until I figured out the order. It goes 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 3 , 7 , 8 , Hobs and Shaw , 9 , X.

Can’t wait for the new one this week
They are hijacking a container truck before now a long tanker truck
again these Indian tales ...
They know they can just rob the truck when the driver is refueling/toilet break/meal break right?

Everything wrong with this scene...<br>1. Hahn&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s biceps buffed up like The Rock&#39;s when she jumped out of the rear window<br><br>2. Letty points a liquid nitrogen gun to her face while clipping it on <br><br>3. Why is the gas truck driver in the Dominican Republic a Mexican?  <br><br>4. Truck driver doesn&#39;t notice cars skidding next to him and exploding hitches, but Letty catches his eye on &quot;top&quot; of the truck?
This like the only time they ever tried to get gas
This is happening now in 2022  😅
Danke für die Anleitung. Sprit ist zu teuer in Deutschland.
Didnt realize this was a Trailer for the year 2022 and the gas price explosion Happening now. Forming a Team for this, anyone in?
I’m Dominican and I can’t help but notice that truck driver sounds Mexican asf I thought this was DR😂
All this extra shit and they could have just shot out the tires of the truck pulling the trailers
Paul and Jordana look great!
Vin and Michelle look great!
Is she Anna Lusia from Lost series??
Wait a minute, is that grand national equipped with turbo??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIo0u_ImfHs&amp;t=317">5:17</a> I felt bad for this guy
Does everyone in the Dominican Republic have a pet iguana?
I would get a gun to control the driver of oil truck, easier and safier.
Ain’t no way a rig would haul that many tanks of gas
OMG

From which movie did this part had been taken
Man fuck dem!!! Making my gas expensive, I’m waiting till all the crew dies horrible 😆😆😆
What kind of car is dom driving
Is fuel really worth that debacle? I suppose realism isn&#39;t really the series strong suit.
https://youtu.be/A8J47zeGPJI
Watching this as a kid was stunning. Now i cant stop facepalming myself for a second.
Here I am watching this before my driving test.
Iguana
Tengo
This is exactly where physics started failing in the franchise
Why didnt letty just stay on the side of they tanker that they were gonna break off? then she coulda just slowed down with the black truck.
Back when it was ‘realistic’
This is a classic scene and in itself deserves an award
I&#39;m glad that Paul and Jordanna reunite.
I hope they plan on sticking together.
They make a good team.
Vin diseal and Michelle had the upper hand.
Pretty intense
Wastage  of gas and money

They have all the fast and furious songs but at the same time in all these movies it doesn&#39;t show then ever being hunted by the cops, it shows then doing so many crimes that I am suprising that the FBI doesn&#39;t show up at there doors in the movies every morning.
Thats not a gas truck, if u have seen the movie. It is pure gold
Can i just point out that this got 51 mill views
I love all of the fast and furious movis
This is when the series started going downhill. Still like it though. Still about street racing and hustling.

Would have been easier to make some fake police cars and block off the road and just commander the truck while it was stopped

Haha Gas is No More GOLD Now !!!!!
Why doesn&#39;t Letty hold on to the front of trailer that they&#39;re about to steal instead of holding onto the one attached to the driver? lol

why didn&#39;t letty jump on to the part that was taken away by the truck stealing it to escape !

Did they even have the decency to give the truck driver and his lizard a ride back to town?

Its simple in real <br>rob the truck driver

When I look at this now I think how stupid. They use such expensive cars for the hiest. Just stop the truck, show a gun and take the truck. Then the driver jumps out so easily and Letty cannot jump off the back. Plus they end up destroying a tank or 2 and nearly kill the driver.
It&#39;s a great movie

nice  bro  so  qute part
Sometimes, I say to myself that the gas truck driver was the same truck driver that nearly killed Letty, Brian, and Vince with a shotgun from the 1st film.
This is what made me want to get a Buick Regal GNX
Nice drive
fantastic...thanks vin diesel and all..

Why didn&#39;t they  stop the truck driver at the gun point in the first place and then loot the oil??? Would have saved them a lot of trouble 😜 and unnecessary heroic actions

Funny that in the first film, Dom and his crew were unable to take out the truck with the driver with a shotgun. But in this film, they were able to take out the gas fuel truck with the driver with a revolver and his pet iguana. I liked this film better than the first in my opinion.
Jajajajaja
When Fast and Furious was about cars , women , roads and family

Why do the effects look so shit?
Did that whole movie cost $20 looked like they just made everything with the computer what did these so called actors even Do?
So they turned to incest I thought he was only gay
Was there a reason the truck guy decided to keep speeding while going down the hill? I mean, its his life vs some petrol. What idiot would risk their life for petrol?
What happens when gas hits 5$ a gallon.
Overly convoluted and complex bullshit. You pull the truck over, pay off the driver, and drive away with the whole thing.... The driver doesn&#39;t OWN the fucking trailers.
I love this badass letty:(
how stupid can they be ? just kill that driver and get everything !          TOTAL NON-SENSE

So dom is weak and gay
I love all the fast and furious movies
These Fast 4 scene is like a climax orgasm, the best ever on sequel. After Paul Walker died &amp; DJ take it to another level, their storyline was moving away from car races...so dissapointed.
Reverse gears don’t go this fast. Same as Dom and Brian’s race.
game
Couldnt they just pull over the guy and knock him out or sum so extra
CGI was rubbish back then!
Xxx riteune muvpllz
Meaning less....<br>They can deal with the driver
For doing this they can<br>1.Stop the truck by some acting that they got injured and they can beat the driver and could take over it<br>2. Show the gun and make him to get out of it<br>and there are more plans. By making the above plan executed they could get 6 containers without any damage...!
Couldn&#39;t dom have just driven round the corner instead of driving under the flaming tank of fuel

Anyone else here who thought they seen every fast and furious
or just put a gun in his head and do it more safely😂✌️
They need to go back to doing these heists using Honda&#39;s .<br><br>All that extra torque,  is just not needed
What the fuck was that..🤦🏻‍♂️ if they want to steal gas only, why they didn’t steal the whole lorry by killing that stupid driver..🤨 unnecessarily they waste two tanks as well as an expensive lorry 🚛
The thing that I like about these movies is how they use kiddish teamwork

they were alot and the driver was alone, they would arrest him or hold a gun on his head rather destroying the truck.. they could loot the truck easily, couldn&#39;t they?

Quick question is Han&#39;s dating another girl what happened to Gisele huh im confused on this one what number is this movie and i gotta say han and Gisele look cute as a couple no joke
why the gas tank bounce a lot<br><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIo0u_ImfHs&amp;t=377">6:17</a>
This clip:<br><br>Wouldn&#39;t it have been easier to cause a small accident. Where both parties come to a stop to exchange details...then rob him.....that would have been better option that this 15min episode .....just a thought!!!!!
Funny how Dom almost kills himself and his girlfriend by drifting under the bouncing and nearly exploded tank the idiot slowed down and with that almost successfully crushed both of them

Good movie. But there are very few details I like to point out that offends realists. But right now I&#39;m tired.

Ena drama chodn di ki lohd c ikla drvir bhr kad dinde ..
I&#39;m getting this thought... Actually we guys are admiring something that&#39;s not even right... They&#39;re stealing something and we guys are liking it...Where are we leading to... Even though they&#39;re the heroes its not ok to admire them...If the heroes are stealing something from an culprit or like stopping an illegal activity(like the next parts of f&amp;f)...That should be admirable but not this one
That truck is definitely in violation of DOT standards

<b>Good</b><br><del>Good</del><br><i>Good</i>

The best scene for me, I really like this movie!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIo0u_ImfHs&amp;t=226">3:46</a> That&#39;s what she said
Superb
Dont remember this scene
At least the iguana is ok
Dominic Toretto in Dominican Republic<br>Vin Diesel stealing Diesel
Instead of doing soo much for gas,they could have just beat the truck driver and steal the truck away.😂😂😂🤣
The truck driver is the hero in this scene, he was only trying to defend himself from thieves, and he didn’t leave his pet iguana behind🦎.
Bellissimo
She could have just knocked that trick driver with that hammer and rob the whole thing?
This is when the series start to dying. Also stole the fuck truck  don´t need all this for gas.
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
Film Good 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIo0u_ImfHs&amp;t=377">6:17</a> is she lerning hes name ??
Nice video bro
Best Ever Scene ...
বাংলাদেশ থেকে কে দেখছো??
What is it with jumping off cars to other cars or just ditching your car by jumping off
Logic rip😪😪
I&#39;m not a huge Grand National fan but it looks like this one took a beating I hope it wasn&#39;t a real one and from the fender Vents it might have been a GNX and people are paying stupid money for those today
They couldn&#39;t just take over the truck. It&#39;s just one guy. Anyway looks cool the dangerous way
I love you vin desel
روعه
is no-one gonna talk about how cool that 6wd truck is?
Thats long truck boy
Y we love F AND F
Music??
Yes
Antony
Poor truck
Omg what a scene 🔥😍
Yah this is when this shit started to get stupid and incredibly unrealistic
Dom? Dom? Dom? Dooom.... I got this babe chill 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Only one man was there. They could just stop the vehicle and rob it. Why so complicated strategy was required?
That just looks like GTA
What car is that Doms
Yes he is dom..
Lie.bomm drive, OK
Tego and Rico be having me laughing 😂 Rico&#39;s face at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIo0u_ImfHs&amp;t=191">3:11</a>
Maybe they wouldn’t have to steal gas if they drove like a Nissan or something that doesn’t get 4 mpg

If she would&#39;ve gotten on the other trailer, they wouldn&#39;t have had to go through all that bullshit.

Pinches pendejos de don Omar y ?????
Nekem nagyon tetszik
Hi luchaa
AMAZING!!!
I&#39;ve wanted a black Monte Carlo since this scene.
Why don&#39;t these guys just shoot the truck driver and get it done with? Oh wait, these guys are morally righteous criminals.
The moment the chain broke, the truck would speed up suddenly and hits Dom&#39;s car.
