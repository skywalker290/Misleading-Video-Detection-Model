what&#39;s a chanmel?
Oh, Looks like I wasted another click again. Sorry trackpad... :(
I think this video is a disgusting way for you to try to earn extra cash!- You exemplify the typical dog eat dog sacrifice anyone type of mentality in the world today and believe me, the greatest harm will be done to YOU! no one else! Eddie Murphy is enjoying his life while you sit back and try to think of creative ways to earn a quick buck! no wonder you are suffering financially. You are willing to throw anyone under the bus for the $. Find GOD and get a real life!
How did he die???  I didn&#39;t hear about Eddie Murphy died! 
GET A LIFE DAMMIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That&#39;s a lie! Eddie Murphy is still alive!
Chanmel... I spotted it.
WTF?! Whever uploaded this is officially a fucking moron.

get a life
Thats not COOL OR FUNNY!!!! Dont DO stuff like that!!! Take this down NOW. But of coarse your not going to so why am I even typing this?
I think he wouldn&#39;t be in 2012&#39;s A Thousand Words?
flagged
Is this the script to A Thousand Words?  Because, that fucking sucks too.
How does it feel to be so small that you could run into a wall with a full erection and STILL manage to break your nose?!?...
Whoever put this channel together is an idiot.
Not funny at all
Bless Your Heart Wadd Eater. Get A Job!!
@MrUnsugarcoated 

Then why did Murphey explain how the universe was made to me right now if he dead in the head huh?
everybody knows we all die dipwad
this is fake and dumb
No matter how many views you get....you will NOT get paid.  YouTube does NOT pay you for misleading/false advertising videos.  I guess you should take it down, huh?
Dumb Ass
@pbrownonyouification Al Gore DID NOT WIN you Jackass, get over it!!!!!!!

Who makes this shit up? : )
Ever heard of Karma?
This post needs to be removed. Let&#39; s not start rumors that are not true. And this was from FoxNews, should be ashamed.

Couldn&#39;t stop laughing at the headline! LMFAO!

FoxNews  chanMel?  since when is there an M in channel

@TheTamtam76 
Norbit?
@claregarrity117 he isnt dead duh? :L
@StockyDoccy he aint dead!! read the comments!
omg rest in piece eddie
If Eddie Murphy is indeed deceased, it must have happened only hours ago, as I haven&#39;t heard about it from any other source. (29February2012) 
Wow, when was channel spelled with an M? This crap to discredit Fox News is typical of Democrats. If you worked this hard at a real job, Maybe we could get you to pay taxes instead of holding your hand out.
TAKE THIS OFF. HE HAS KIDS
justjoe469       Because it gets a response....Understand?
Eddie dead? What bout &quot;Freddie&#39;s Dead?&quot; Never forget old what&#39;s his name....



why do people do stuff like this?
y..que carajo.todo cortado..

@Forestbender1114 if you really think that then you&#39;ve never seen Fox News.
LIAR!!!!

why  do that   how  would  u feel if  somebody posted on facebook or  twitter or this site  your mom or  granny  died  its  sick an pathetic
1986 visiting my father&#39;s neighbor, he&#39;s now close  to 90.  During a card game at his house MURPHY was displayed on TV.  He said with that deep southern drawl  I DON&#39;T LIKE HIM!  I was so glad to see I wasn&#39;t the only intelligent Black Person left on the planet.  A peoples too dumb to know Friend from Foe&quot; is reminiscent of the POOR WHITE SOUTHERNERS fighting for their own enslavement.
Would anybody actually notice or more likely care if he was?
Lol, because he really much be dead when I just saw a preview for a movie he&#39;s in coming out. XD
i believe that if someone made a fake justin bieber death video everyone would thumbs up.
This is absolutly stupid, I can&#39;t believe that anyone would actually joke around like that. 
RIP Martin Lawrence
rubbish
R.I.P Obama

lol
LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He didn&#39;t die. Only his career is dead. And, the sick fuck who made this video needs to be smacked upside the head.
FoxNewsChan&quot;m&quot;el.
FOX AIN&#39;T SHYT!! Sorry bastards!!! THAT SHIT IS NOT FUNNY!
may GOD BLESS YOU!!! whoever you are sothat you come covicted of your ways?
@billymathews1135 That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to know?  If they are trying to be funny, it&#39;s NOT!!!!!  Any they&#39;re NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

poop!
Don&#39;t feed the troll.
@ThaKronicMan LOOK CLOSLY AT THE CHANNEL NAME :)
The Internet is blowing up with reports that Eddie Murphy is dead. NOT TRUE.
How dare you do something like this!? He is one of the greatest actors and comedians of all time! You should be ashamed of yourself!
wow, thats not even funny. don&#39;t joke about death, you dumb shit.
Toodles, Ed.  You were never that funny to begin with.
Chode.
Dragonfly Now that&#39;s some BULLSHIT!!! Like Whitney is not enough.
IDOITS
dick face
lol you guys fell for it?? oh well......i&#39;d believe eddie turning gay quicker than him dying...sorry to those who find that offensive, but so what in the end you guys don&#39;t give a d-...
You&#39;d think they would have thought it through a bit more by using a clip of someone other than Neil Cavuto (the guy who only does the financial shows.)
Hoax-NewsChannel
WTF?!! Eddie Murphy is not dead!!!
FOXNewsChanmel, Lmfao.....
Ya right stupid! Go eat a cobra, Wait you cant you arent badass like the Honey Badger
@bfnfamily 

Then why reply to my comment and defending Fox?
This is just lame
It is not really Fox News Channel! It is from some idiot who put that as their Youtube username so that it would give them a reason to make fun of FoxNews! 
someone took all this time to do this ??
Attention he/she got.

epic fail !!
@ThaKronicMan CNN= Communist News Network.
@mysterymac38 lol
fuk off
i love these, because they&#39;re so obviously fake
foxnewschan&#39;m&#39;el? 
seems legit.
Your fucking Dickheads!!!!!!

@kaylasmallworldsrock its fake. who ever made this did a very sitty job of making it
A liar can&#39;t be trusted. 
I fucking hate fox, back to CNN.
FoxNewsChanmel haha i see what you did with the m
FUCK YOU BITCH
Fox news, your integrity is somethin else.
they need to stop that mess eddie aint dead
@jimbowie09 sure is a scam, the idiot that made this vid  ugh
crappy audio..wtg fool!
THIS SHIT IS MORBID &amp; DISGRACEFUL
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT ! I almost cried :p
@NuLaidMusic 

Yes, because all the other media outlets tell truth and is never bias. *sarcasm*

I don&#39;t watch the news, so don&#39;t even go there. The video is homemade.
He&#39;s alive!
LOL FOXNewsChanMel    Sneaky Bastard LOL
@TheLolitasmith There is no &#39;may not&#39; about it, you were/are wrong. If it wasn&#39;t relevant to you you would have posted. If you choose to let politicians TELL YOU how to think, you will always be ignorant and resort to name calling instead of facts. Unlike you, I research things personally to be informed with facts. Try it sometime, you just might learn something. Get a life? Got one and I intend to protect it from uninformed, brain-dead people who can&#39;t think for themselves.
I think they meant his carreer died.
love eddie!
@mcaustinsr I may or may not be wrong about the video being Fox News, but it&#39;s not that relevant to me.  This will be the last time I respond to you.  WOW, you seem to be just another uninformed brainwashed Fox News Doodle Head -   Get a life!
just like cnn, obama, fox news, christianity, the bible, and any given politician: ALL LIES!!!!
@TheLolitasmith GET A GRIP! That isn&#39;t a Fox News broadcast!  You can&#39;t tell the difference from a sloppy, poorly edited clip from a real one?  Cry and whine all you want about Fox News, the NUMBER 1 NEWS NETWORK.  You probably listen to to MSNBC, the LOWEST rated news channel. Fox #1 because they report truth and provide 2 sides. MSNBC, LAST PLACE, because THEY LIE, are 1 sided and NEVER give you the whole story. Do your own research and you will find out you&#39;ve been DUPED!
And the dish ran away with a crack spoon.
From the picture id say he died from a bad headache, lol.
FOX NEWS ARE ALWAYS CREATING STORIES.  THEY ARE THE WORST NEWS STATION IN AMERICA.  THIS IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF THEM NOT KNOWING WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.  THEY LIE LIKE CARPET!
THIS IS A HOAX AND SHOULD BE DELETED... JUST ASK EDDIE!
@Dominik39able  AGREE! 
Karma is a BITCH PUNK ASS!
Wow who&#39;s dumber. The moron who made this crap or the stupid idiots goin. durr  fox news.. durr lies. duuurr.. pfft

Awesome.
@NuLaifMusic: And typical of a mindless follower of the Commiecrat News Network to believe this hoax.
AS MANY AS YOU BLESS , YOU WILL BE BLESSED, AS MANY AS YOU CURSE YOU WILL BE CURSED , NO MAN WILL BE ABLE TO REMOVE IT OR STOP IT 
fox news did post this dumb video soon youtube will take this down
@NuLaifMusic Did you know the root of anger is truth? It&#39;s true. So, you&#39;re mad because Fox News speaks the truth.....and you simply can&#39;t handle it. Do not blame Fox News, go look in the mirror. You are the coward too afraid to accept the truth. 
FOXNewsChanmel is not how you spell FOXNewsChannel

Fake FOX account.
I had to go to BET website to see if this was true and I am glad I didn&#39;t panic ahead of time.
no he aint stop playin!!!
@Kyzeer2123 Uploader dont care what is right or wrong, he just needs bloody clicks on his video. Such a greedy ass the uploader is.
Wow that&#39;s funny, Eddie Murphy must be a zombie or a ghost or something because I just saw a preview for a new movie he&#39;s in yesterday.
Dumb ass
Typical of FOX NEWS is always all LIES!!!
Why are you a piece of shit ? 
This is a senseless and hurtful act not only to the individgual&#39;s family, but to the millions of fans he has come to be honored 7 admired by.  If Foxx New reported this without verification they then are in violation of journalism plagerism. Always check your info when reporting news because it always affects the people who view it.
I flagged it as well.
this cannot be impossible.
disgusting to do that to Eddie Murphy , his family and friends......shame. And no sound quality in the video either. That must be 2011´s most shameful youtube.com video I´ve seen.
Sorry. Meant to say stop. See what happens when u drive me crazy FOX NEWS??!!!
SOme posting videos of videos where claiming and I emphasize the word claiming dead. It&#39;s fake stuff like this that keeps me from watching news on tv - always report bad stuff. TV news is never good. Especially since you get more on the net for free. And no, I don&#39;t mean YOUTUBE
gotta love FOX news,if you want rumors,inuendo,and outright lies then fox news is the place for you.
aint this slander a fedral offense. dam liars

Fox .. News ... ChanMEL?

...Fail
uuuuuuuuuuuu dummmmmmmmmmmmm azzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The audio here has failed. And I&#39;m glad it did.
The news are talking about other thing,so thats the reason why he turns down the sound ;)
When reached for comment, Jack Nicholson (who was seen dining at a trendy L.A. restaurant with friends) shook his head sadly, then said ominously, &quot;I warned him.&quot;
Fox news always misinforms lol
LMAO! look at the freaking name of who uploaded it! FOXNewschanMel. I believe there are two Ns and not an m
Rip fox audio
it got me
The name is FOXNewsChanmel... trolling at its finest.
@Karudu lol me too
fuck who did this video it&#39;s not funny asshole !!!!! 
ths one is fake, jack black dead is that real. goole it jack black is dead.  jack black fall 60 feel to his death new zen for filming new movie. dam suc no more kung fu panda show or 3 movie, songs
trolled
who didnt know this was complete horseshit..really? smh
Please dont make videos like these saying that a person is dead but not really dead. How would you like it if people post video about one of your relatives and say they were dead but actaully not? I dont really ask for THUMPS UP but please THUMB THIS UP so people can see whats right.
@Multi7079 Heeey now! That&#39;s a diss to the box of rocks! Remember in the 80&#39;s - rocks used to be pets! So this douchebag is dumber than something like... like a hefty bag of diarrhea. &gt;XD 
Great news report! Did you record it off your toaster!? XD
Dude don&#39;t  do that i almost had a stroke
&quot;FOXNewsChanmel&quot;

The fuck&#39;s a chanmel?
I have to say, this is probably the best one like this yet, very creative ;) I give it a thumbs up
This isn&#39;t true.Its a hoax.They said he &#39;&#39;died&#39;&#39; in a snow board accident and they said Avril Lavigne was dead too but look! Shes still alive!
LAME!!!!!
@Karudu lol
@Karudu That would be Friday by Rebecca Black
this aint even funny  i should beat whoeva made dis ass
Heh Heh Heh Heh (Eddie Murphey laugh) lol  whos responsible for this? hahaha xD
Some people shouldn&#39;t be allowed to own a computer or borrow anyone else&#39;s for that matter..
what is the matter with people?..do they think this is funny?
flag that shit, i did 
Why do people make these can anyone tell me or are you that fucked up in the head
@mrgeorge7196 yeah hes been terrible since the 90s...a few good ones like boomerang and life...he was excellent in dreamgirls as well but thats 3 out of about 16
@killuminati214 That was Eddie Murphy&#39;s swan song,but I am a big fan the Nutty Proffesor films[remake].
i flagged this for child abbuse

yet more bollocks from fox news
@mrgeorge7196 Lol, so true.
Hehe...I knew it was fake...I just came here to see the longest dislike bar in history :)
why would some body upload this. smh
You don&#39;t play with life and death. Whoever uploaded this is a fuckin dickhead.
@mrgeorge7196 Haha, that&#39;s funny man. But Eddie&#39;s movies have been pretty damn bad the last 15 years or so. I&#39;m a big Eddie Murphy fan, that&#39;s why these do-do flicks he&#39;s been doing the last decade pisses me off, because i think his talent far exceeds the film roles he&#39;s been excpeting, the only exception being Dreamgirls which he was outstanding in, his performance was as good as Jennifer Hudson&#39;s in that film. I hear Tower Heist is pretty good, i&#39;ve yet to see it, I&#39;ll find out when i rent it.
oh no!
I know this is fake because, i talked to Eddie last night.
no he&#39;s NOT DEAD....LIER LIER PANTS ON FIRE!!!!
Lmao look at the username of the uploader.

What a pathetic piece of shit he must be, hahahahaha.

FoxNewsChanMel.

Jesus, what a blatant and obvious moron.
Thanks /b/-tards.
not cool
@kidcharlemagne76 It&#39;s a no brainer. you think that normal regular viewers that are looking for something intresting or something entertaining that&#39;s worth watching  would  agree with your point of view? i think not. obviously this specific video wastde people&#39;s time. The spare time we have to go on you tube we dont need to waste it on this crap. If youtube had the view dislike before viewing  a  video, you would be the only view.
Most people make good choices, but get Tricked.
@MEGABOINK65 hell fucking yea!!! 
@15551cue 
your an idiot
yes  his  career has  been dead a long time  
The dark side is strong in his dis-like bar....
fake
someone flag this shit
damn eddie murphy is dead. this sucks
@MEGABOINK65 FUKIN THAnK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I like police cops
@mrgeorge7196 sorry lol but i spy was good the rest suck though =)
@MEGABOINK65 fucking perfect

@mrgeorge7196 lol its norbit not newbert
funny i just notice on my ipad, when i go to the youtube app. it shows the thumps up and down. we need it here BAD!!
dude your a idiot  mrgeorge7196 sweet comment.
Twat!
we all know that isnt how we spell channel 
Stupid ass couldn&#39;t spell channel right!
@MEGABOINK65 , I agree.  This is crazy!!!  I like the petition ideal:))
Eddie Murphy is not dead! This is not a very funny joke,

@blackrosesolace Why, were you looking for me?
@blackrosesolace Doesnt look like anyone else gets the joke or pun. Besides why would you joke about FOX? You could make a whole comedy routine on NBC and all of its retarded offspring!
@MEGABOINK65  i agree totally wat a scam
He&#39;s been dead ever since he started doing those lame ass movies like &quot;I spy,Meet Dave,Dr.Doolittle,A vampire in Brooklyn,Daddy Day Care, Newbert....ect,ect.
@blackrosesolace then why are you being defensive as though you mnade it or at least not denouncing it as stupid? Do you think its funny?
stupid video like this shouldn&#39;t be allowed on here, because then fans will think that have really died, when they know that they&#39;re still alive
agree

Something like this should be illegal
WAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS NIGGA IS STUPID OR WAT HE NOT DEAD

Desperate for views?
 I think we should start a petition on youtube, that will make youtube show dislikes before clicking on a video before viewing. If agree    thumps up!!
This idiot that posted this should be thrown off of you tube then a cliff. This is a fake!!!! Eddie is till very much alive and well.
@blackrosesolace you making a joke about it. i haven&#39;t read one comment that anyone found it humorous. why don&#39;t you just admit it was a dufus move say sorry and move on.

@blackrosesolace That&#39;s not how it looks when you read the comments.
@blackrosesolace Well, youve made a video claiming someone very famous has died. Dont you think at the very least it could impact employees that work there?
Besides why would you make that joke? I mean Eddie Murphy has been making me laugh since i was 18. Everyone has there day, why rush his? This was really very uncool.
SHAMEon YOU..........
You gonna get karma bad one thing you dont play with is peoples life!! Shame on you!! 
wtf
@2Bored2Listen haha you condradicted yourself a lill xD
Dude, I knew this was fake but the name of the uploader convinced me to watch it. I really wish I saw that snuck in &quot;m&quot;
@dalewormheart3704 sorry to tell you but thats NOT chicken from KFC :S its fried RAT!
You obviously lack respect and decency mate!
i love it how you have the time to make STUPID videos about stuff like thiss..
hes coming out with a new MOVIE!! people r idiots
karma is for real...when you say someone is dead as a joke, one of your family members could die or get in some accident and really die...
FUCK I WAS SCARE!!!
@dalewormheart3704 Not true, but everyone can clearly see that your brain OD&#39;ed long ago on stupidity.
@RealLifeOmen Okay, then explain the audio that appears for a second and vanishes. And the fact the bar at the bottom doesn&#39;t look anything like that of something Fox News would REALLY show.  And how the channel name is &quot;Chanmel&quot; with an M, instead of N. Eddie is still alive.
To the author of this:

You dont fuck much, right?

&quot;Edward Regan &quot;Eddie&quot; Murphy (born April 3, 1961) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, singer, director, and musician.

Box office takes from Murphy&#39;s films make him the second-highest grossing actor in the United States.&quot;


@RealLifeOmen Eddie Murphy is still alive. This is just a guy with no life making obviously fake news stories. 
@2Bored2Listen You also don&#39;t threaten to come to someones house with a butchers  knife just because he is an idiot and he makes you angry. This guys makes me mad too, but I wouldn&#39;t let him turn me into a creep.
his style of comedy from 80s and 90s is
So howed he play in tower heist
@luvmeforever3 
I know, right?  Love how they muffled the sound so that we couldn&#39;t hear the REAL news alert.
FUCKEN SCUMBAG 

This is what happens when a asshole grows tired of jackin&#39; off.
Clever.... why would you use such cleverness in order to piss everyone off? Though I guess that&#39;s the definition of a troll.... still pathetic.
ok whoever liked it is a huge dick

What is this from?
@tazamack12 Gee i wish im smart enough to know all about the technology so i can shut it my self lol, but if i did that i problebly going to prison lol. downloading music etc, thats fair enough that means people cant steal movies, music whatever lol but thats not good enough thou. What i think is they should shut the YOUTUBE Broadcast for good so that way no more nusty comment&#39;s or video post like this one. and thank god u did same reporting it too lol, no worries hope u have a good day mate
@tazamack12 I agree, i already reported it anyway. So i think everyone should do the same, i wish all around the work internet should shut it down for a week lol. i know it sounds stupid, but i think its good idea so that way people from around the world can&#39;t post stupid comment&#39;s. Just to teach them a lesson 
I hate all racists.
why wont YouTube delete the all the misleading untrue garbage?
Didn&#39;t even spell Channel right
THIS IS SOME FAKE CRAP I CAN TELL BECAUSE YOU SPELLED CHANNEL WRONG GENIUS.

Eddie Murphy is very much alive. This is some morbid stuff right here.
EDDIE MURPHY STILL ALIVE HE HAS OUT A NEW MOVIE.
Look at the uploader. FOXNewsChan&quot;M&quot;el. It&#39;s not real people. 
HE IS NOT DEAD PEOPLE!!!
Fox News made NO SUCH news alert.  Someone out there in youtube land with way too much time on his hands in mom &amp; dad&#39;s basement hacked this together with his movie maker software. Did you just happen to notice there was no DECIPHERABLE soundtrack?  Don&#39;t you find that a bit odd?!?  There was no soundtrack because our news faker would have had to create one from scratch AND have it sound like Nick&#39;s very unique, very well-known voice.  You don&#39;t learn how to do that until News Faking 102.
Eddie is very much alive.  Yes, he has some acting talent.  As for comedic talent, he is gifted.  Unfortunately, a great deal of that gift is devoted to raw, foul, vulgar, sick bathroom humor.  Television censors force him to refrain, but take them away, and put him on cable TV or in front of a live audience at a comedy club, or in Vegas, and he morphs into this despicable individual who gives comedy a very bad name. Audiences laugh due to embarassment, or shock, or booze, or a combo of all 3!
This video is bs
@Zconnor23 .  Absolutely!  I agree 1000%.
@TheOioink Pity it&#39;s completely lacking a sense of humour then. Why I&#39;m answering a moron is beyond me. I must be bored out of my mind... can you imagine that... being bored out of your mind? Perhaps one day medical science will be able to give you a mind all of your own so you can relate. Until then... &quot;HAHAHA, you funny, fucktard!!!!&quot; 
it is fake it says foxnewschanmel
I guess we&#39;re guilty for pumping up this idiots views. I shoulda known better.
@farmerne Great idea
Eddie Murphy Is not dead I looked him just now and it will tell me that he died, that is a sick mean thing to do?! Who did that!
If people keep putting out rumors that someone dies, God&#39;s gonna get back at them and take someone in their family.
Just flag this video as Inappropriate --&gt; Spam --&gt; Misleading text and Youtube shall have to delete it.

@rmgrowe1617 

Who???
@thesteveus i had no idea robert schimmel died until a year after it happened and with greg giraldo i didn&#39;t know til 6 months after when the tribute aired on comedy central.
I am sorry but I am not watching fox news no more. they lie
At first I was like &quot;OMG NOOOOO!&quot; Then I saw this was posted by Fox so then I was like :l
@lordofthenoobs ha ha ha ha, your comment is so true.
I wish Youtube would automatically delete any videos that get more than a 90% negative rating.
reported as fraud.
@timanderic1 You think that FOX News reports slander? Really. Is that why Fox has been #1 in the ratings for the past 11 of their 15 years on the air? It&#39;s the mainstream, liberal, biased media that &quot;unfairly&quot; reports a bunch of B.S.  Oh, I should have said that they don&#39;t report their &quot;FAIR SHARE&quot;. Obama&#39;s 2 favorite words. 
YEA RIGHT! gooonie gooo gooo! AND YOUR WIFE IS A BABY BIG FOOT gus!
eddie dead, huh ? just wondering how that is seeing that he&#39;s in a movie after this was posted ? 
michael jackson died at 50 omg
Honestly though I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the ACTUAL Fox News Channel reported this level of slander 
Yes, FOXNewsChanMel. 
Must&#39;ve used up his 1000 words.
Eddie Murphy not dead hes alive 
u a bitch
Youtube should really show the dislike bar in video searches so we don&#39;t waste time viewing crap like this.
DA FUCK OUTTA HERE!!!!!
Really Though? But I just saw the movie &#39;Tower Heist&#39; a week ago. Idiots -.-
@lllmrsdarcy4everlll lol me too.  however even the real fox news isn&#39;t honest most of the time.
wtf don&#39;t youtube remove this?
pretty sick sense of humor, just remember you receive what you give.
@isbourne flagged.

Flagged.
Report this. I did.

In my country we say,that if u say that somebody is death and is not,then it is mean that he/she will have long life :)

You Idiot Eddie aint dead he is a healthy comedian, and hasn&#39;t he just finished another Shrek movie :S
I saw FoxNews and knew this couldn&#39;t be real. That was before I noticed they misspelled &quot;Channel&quot;
wow y wuld u which someone to die thats hatefull and if i wee u ill be srry for myself
@DarkTrojanHorse you dont like eddie murphy?
you sorry-ass
oh if eddie murghy is dead then how come i saw him on tv last night dumb ass
that nigga is stickin around for a long time, even if he dies his comedy is the shit, aint never gunna go away
Don&#39;t be stupid Eddie Murphy is not dead.

They should get rid of this video....cause it&#39;s bs

YouTube encourages trolls, automated playlists, popups, copyright bullshit, the snatching of really good videos, irrelevant unfair flags and a plethora of other issues while SHIT like this is allowed to circulate.  FUCK YOU YOUTUBE.
you and the people who liked this are all some dumbasses, do you like attention that much?
i dont understand people like this
@Jemm558 dont feed the troll he wants attention because he cant get it outside a PC
Why are you guys so mad? Eddie Murphy is clearly not dead. Did you expect to find revelations on youtube before the media blows up about it?
why are people sayin that these famous people are dead when they are not dead yall just mad cause yall aint makin money like them yall dead 
Didn&#39;t know the guy.
Omi God Eddie &quot;Axel Folie&quot;Murphy is dead!
you are such a dumb ass for this
this is a horrible video. to say someone is dead? wow. 
RIP YOURSELF!! What a horrible thing to wish on someone, he is a father brother and son, have you no feelings at all
go to hell you sick shit 
I saw this video in my recommended videos and was like: &#39;&#39;Blah, what a joke. Of course he&#39;s not dead.&#39;&#39; And then I read the uploaders name: FOXNewsChannel and thought &#39;&#39;HOLY FUCK THIS SHIT IS FOR REAL&#39;&#39;. And then I clicked to watch it, and only after this horrible mistake I noticed that the uploader&#39;s name is ChanMel with an M and not an N. 
Tower heist?
sucky bitch you lie as you breath
Well done you just stole 17 seconds of my life. 
WHAT Dude why yeah that got peeps attention That is phucked man I can&#39;t even believe I was so stupid to hit the box. If Eddie passed I would know be4ore the ABC- NBC- CBS- BBC- THE AP- Fox News- MSNBC- So this is national enquirer type chit. So if I do some nasty chit like this I get 42,362 views nada. 
@crazywhiteboyjunky your incredibly immature if you ask me. Got some issues there fella. My advice: calm the fuck down.
Its not funny at all.
Not COOL WTF
this is not funny

@Tralman1965 actually hes announced that hes down with the kiddie shit and gonna do some straight up raw stuff again :D
Probably killed by a drag queen street walking trick. Those bitches will cut a closet case.
Eddie doing better than most of us.Baby Bye!
@MrChinesecrested He&#39;s not dead and you better watch it, he might come after you 

@teerairan1 yea I agree, ppl dont know lol
@Tralman1965 not his bank account though......... Ice cream - the ice cream man is coming........
GET A LIFE
how is he dead in june when i seen his movie tower heist days ago lol #fail
@MrChinesecrested I bet your pissed that you spend your money &quot;buying the bar a round&quot; for someone who isn&#39;t even dead huh? HAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!
he died of AIDS he got from drag queen
pointless.
HE IS NOT SHAME ON YOU
Lame! You troll!
i thought i saw on tv along time ago that he died? and is was showing his life or maybe it was someone 1 els but i was positive it was him and i was like aww he&#39;s dead and was one of my fav actors but then i see a preview of a movie with him and was like ?!?!?!? wasnt he dead ? guess it was some1 els
Thjis is stupid shit why people do these kinds of things i don&#39;t know  death is not funny  this is the video that needs to be banned
This really scared me and made me mad.This was not cool
Some people have a very sick sense of humor.....to the people who love him they don&#39;t find this funny at all. What would be funny is if FOXNEWS sued you for using their logo and name this way. I know i would get a great laugh out of that.
fuck this guy what&#39;s wrong with youtube putting this at the top of the recommended videos time after time
FOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dumbasses

FUCKING STUPID
@Tralman1965 well at 50 years old he had good run! Now he will be hosting the 2012 oscars..
How silly. He&#39;s not dead! His career is.
He&#39;s not dead!
STOP THIS BULLSHIT YO THATS NOT RIGHT, WOULD UR FAM LIKE IF THEY FAKED UR DEATH?
This is an old hoax. It was first rumoured in 2009 and now again? Stop this b*shit
