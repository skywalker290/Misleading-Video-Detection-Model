omg she is gorgeous
I love you <br>Katrina kaif👑👑👑😘😘😘🔥🔥🔥😜😜😜🍺🍺💞💞🥰🥰🧨🧨💣💣💣😭😭😭
She is already wearing makeup.. huh !! Fake !
Every single bad spot on her face is clearly visible before the makeup, she&#39;s definitely not wearing any makeup. Makeup just enhanced her beauty. People who have poor net connection with blurred picture quality, could not figure out difference between natural and makeup look
one thing I like about Kay beauty is no liquid, just sticks. easy to carry to airports🥰
💖💖
I dont think she needs to fill brows....but brushing is enough
Eyeshadow stick bliss doesn&#39;t seem to exist
nykaa is fraud company they share our personal details with scammers so please dont purchase from their if you want products please purchase them from any other store but please dont use nykaa its a fraud company
What lipstick shade is she using?
i find a hair inside kay beauty blush after uning 2 days ..the hair stuck from inside ....😭😭😭😭😭
katrina looks largely professional and gorgeous.
Beautiful girl😙👌
It&#39;s funny how in one of her old interviews Katrina said her dislike was make up !
Natural beauty. A ladies own beuaty without makeup. All vulnerable. Her actual face.
Ridiculous, I had no idea Katrina had these make up skills ...<br><br>Ridiculous, I had no idea we have to be make up artist to be an actress.. <br><br>Dumb Dumb ME...
Hi katrina ji aap thik ho or kya ho rha h
does she wears any makeup?Because it looks like she is done with it. she just doesn&#39;t need

She has filters on, foundation on and of course so many surgeries. We need someone to show us their natural face and then put make up.
Actually THIS is what is called makeup...that you make up for any tiny flaws ..that&#39;s all
I bought the lip liner Vanity after seeing this video. Man! The color is absolutely different. It&#39;s pretty dark pink and not a nude shade that&#39;s potrayed here. There&#39;s a false representation of products here
Make up ki zarurat he ni wese he piyri lgti hin 👍🏻☺️🌹
Kitrena natural beuty my fvrt❤️
Katrina is so freakin adorable and she has the most beautiful skin tone and I have just most of the stuff that I got from Christmas from my aunt because she knows how I love doing makeup tutorials and showing it to my fans
She looks so beautiful without makeup..
I love you kat
Why does this video looks like it has that air brushed filter?
Katrina looks gorgeous even without make-up.  katrina ko singaar ki nahi  , singaar ko katrina ki zaroorat hai .
She could do better. Seriously
I did not like the method and application of her makeup. So immaturable
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsOD3p2PfZk&amp;t=129">2:09</a> 🤣🤣🤣🤣but I love Katrina❤❤❤❤how beautiful she is❣❣❣❣

So it&#39;s basically Kay beauty campaign 😂😂
How to do makeup on makeup
Very nice♥️
I like classy makeup look...it&#39;s too natural...thanks kat💜
She doesn&#39;t need makeup...makeup needs her
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeR-h9C2fgc">https://youtu.be/IeR-h9C2fgc</a>
Such a good skin no need of make up
So you all can’t see blurring filter ?
How to apply makeup💄 on makeup 😂😂
Lovvveeeee the simple no makeup look
I like sai pallavi
Strangely, she is already wearing makeup 😳...also, no one will ever look like the beautiful Indian actresses but can get tips to enhance what you have at a salon from a make-up artist with a fresh clean face. Or test it out at Sephora with a professional. That would be the best tutorial.
Not only she has a base on, but also the video looks like there&#39;s some filter, airbrush or something. There&#39;s no problem with it. But just for once mention it in the video that you already have some make up on. Just look at this comment section, a lot of people are buying the fact that her bare skin looks this flawless. This is misleading.
What happen to her accent... its literally gone now... She sounds more like indian way... Wow...
Love this tutorial
Vaise acchi ho ap ..bharat movie last seen bhul gyi ap kya .....my words ...

WTH,? Even a blind person can tell, she has her all make up on including concealers, Foundation and Eyebrows. What rubbish is this?? You guys think people in India are stupid??
Thanks for make up demo
I like katrina... but she is fake here...<br>I dont like sonam but gonna watch her as she can show no makeup face
Toothbrush 😁😆
she looks beautiful 💜💜
She&#39;s average looking and extremely overrated.
Katrina darling theek ho I like like your face hips and
For all people who is saying she is already done with 50% even before starting, the title is everyday look and not from no or zero make up to everyday look. So all the make up masters please read it😊.
They already do makeup before making vedio and then infront of us they show that they use too little.
she&#39;s a godess
Full of fake things .she alrdy had makeuo on
You are my fav I am your biggest fan I was thinking to make your sketch I am of 8
https://youtu.be/gmGX8by3k3A
I love you katrina but sorry sonam has took it away by showing her &quot;real skin&quot; in vogue tutorial. I have immense respect for her for showing that we are all human and have flaws nothing to be ashamed about ❤
Ur face is already looking like Box ur using contour too💩💩
U look like gay🙄
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGnp5nZ4wZQ">https://youtu.be/WGnp5nZ4wZQ</a>
বুড়ির ঢং দেখো😂😂
She already done make up why u are doing  drma 😏😏😏😏🙄🙄
https://youtu.be/N9L6Xjns03g
She looks beautiful as always ❤
She is love 😗✌❤🔥
It seems no difference between without makeup and with make up 😂
aap bhot achi videos bnate ho mam aap bhot beautiful ho mne bhi apke jaisa banna tha  but mere face pe pimple hone ki vjah se mera face bhot ganda lgta tha fir mne planet ayurveda ka neem capsules try kiya mera face ab bhot thk hogya h thanks for planet ayurveda
I really love and use kay beauty products and i love Katrina but I would have really appreciated if the video showed her doing the makeup from scratch applying it on bare skin rather than applying it on her face which already had base makeup like contour and eyes were also done ...True representation of the makeup products would have done wonders
Katrina is my all time favorite I mean she&#39;s extremely talented beauty qeen of world that&#39;s why I love her very much not only Bollywood&#39;s boss Mr. He&#39;s not he not she Mr. <a href="http://k.dog/">K.dog</a> special lady dog&#39;s actress like A.P. Singh one ...plz stay safe Corona Mam ... Bye Bye &amp; luv u veryyyyyyyy much 👌👍🙏
🖤🖤🖤
Only sonam kapoor had the guts to show her imperfect skin and not sell unrealistic standards
She looks so beautiful without makeup
Loved it 😍

Goodmorning hi am nimisha jha  makeup  thora time lagta hai Katrina is looking great.  I love you aapka letter mai likha hai  mitthi chasni.i love you
So nice😊🌹
She is my favourite actress ❤
She was my fav actress when I was young so whenever I see her my childhood memories flash in front of my eyes 👀. She is a beautiful lady
So let me get this straight, she&#39;s a movie star who obviously invests in skin and body, already has treatments for skin, but she still can&#39;t show her face without makeup and a  blurry filter!!!!! I don&#39;t want to bash someone over having insecurities, but you&#39;re selling insecurity to other people who will think they can never come close to your &quot;natural&quot; look. It&#39;s just bizarre.
Wow Ms Katrina. Your makeup is so natural.  Unlike others who look as though they are clowns in a circus.
😍
Hello...
Katrina you looking so beautiful without makeup
I love how she is already wearing a makeup from the start. It makes me appreciate that she is a human too and has her insecurities despite being so pretty.
Katrina❤️
damn she is so gorgeous
Happiness toomamjitomakeup

Every person that puts make up on KNOWS that she&#39;s wearing base with bronzer and already has her lashes done 👌👌👌👌👌🙊
Hi! I&#39;ve bought her eyeshadow stick recently but I can&#39;t seem to twist the bottom. Is her sticks meant to be sharped once blunt?

Her Contoured face, filled in brows, perfected base (let&#39;s not forget the lashes) says everything. <br>Her products are so convenient though👍
❤️👍
Wow nice mam
she is so expression less... lol
How&#39;s possible Katrina shoots pr jati h Phir bhi itne kam dark circles ☺️☺️
Billboard color Lipstick is not for everyone
Why u girls applying makeup on ur face all the time?
She uses beautiful shades of lipsticks
Just don&#39;t think urself ugly aftr watching this ..<br>She already had her makeup on ... These guys are fooling us totally and making ourselves feel like ugly and uncomfortable abt our own skin. <br>REMEMBER YOUR INNER BEAUTY IS EVERYTHING ...💜💜<br>YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL JUST THE WAY YOU ARE!  💜 LOVE YOU...  <br>HAVE A NICE DAY 🌸
She is wearing makeup base makeup
India is the second most populated country.
Lots of love❤❤❤❤

My love😍❤
Wowww it was such an easy makeup tutorial....just amazing... moreover even the eyeshadow in the crayon shape that&#39;s really cool and simple to apply.
Loved it
JazakAllah beautiful ❤️
What a hack ... used tooth brush instead of spoolie cz she didn&#39;t launch it 🤭🤭
🥰🥰🥰
Boycott karo salli ko,English ki aulaad,druggist
Hats off to those idiots who think she has got no makeup lol !😂😂😂! The biggest joke of the  day she already got mascara in her eyes nude lipstick and all before she starts her video. It’s so easy to fool people and audiences get fooled too lol
She has done make up first and faking😂
love the initiative  Kat&lt;3 &lt;3
Mast hai 👌
Nice 👍
Tu game eatlo makeup krish bakvas j lagas😜
This make-up tutorial was different than youtuber girls, this tutorial is all i wanted 😍😍
You give very calm breezy vibes 👍👍
Y&#39;all hating over how she has her base done is so freaking dumb lol. This tutorial is for eye n lip makeup. Yes she had her bronzer and foundation on. She showed us a quick eyeshadow/lip tutorial also she just used the eyeshadow to show us that we can contour n bronze a little. She never mentioned she is &quot;bare faced&quot;. So instead of hating while lying down doing nothing, it&#39;s better to show some love to the girl who wanted to share her products w us. 💛<br><br>P.s : stick eyeshadow are mostly meant to be blended with the warmth of your fingers and maybe that&#39;s y she/makeup artist did it behind camera since it&#39;s not that important.
Why she don&#39;t do too many films?
She literally doesn’t know how to do makeup and the fact that she owns a makeup line just doesn’t make sense to me.
Katrina mam ap bina makeup ka bhi so cute and so beautiful and stylish lagta ho mam I&#39;m your biggest fan mam love you mam
Buddhi hai..pehle se hi makeup ghisi hui hai
I m going to try every brand by nykaa. Except Kay by Katrina.. coz I hate that lady..Khali pili ka attitude dekhati hai fans ko..<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywood">#boycottbollywood</a>
But she is adorable...humble and simply beautiful
She doesnt wear this and she is using it on top of her makeup making us fools idiots
Wowww natural beauty😇😇😇😇
Kay beauty should invent foundation too....the products are superb from Kay beauty

Just right. Not too much and not too less.
By reading the comments, I&#39;m surprised by how many people get offended by makeup. Why do people hate someone who likes wearing makeup? Like what&#39;s so wrong with that?
Hii Katrina mam I am shraddha ap ko makeup karne ki jururat nahiye😘😘 aap to natural hi khubsoorat ho👌

No no No 😂 she is already with makeup she is lying by the way no hate
Very nice

Hi all,<br>I am a budding youtuber, I make beauty and makeup related videos. I would be grateful if you check out my latest upload on EASY EVERYDAY NUDE MAKEUP LOOK🙏🏻 Thank you❤️
But she isn&#39;t using nyka brand she is using her own brand
Hi Mam l am Maria I Like you so much

Katrina is the last person I would go to for make up looks , i don’t find any of her makeup looks appealing

I am currently watching welcome wowwww
She has started off with proper makeup full on her face
Katrina is beautiful with or without makeup.
I don&#39;t no why ? But i hate her ............bcoz she is like&quot; chilli hui murgi &quot; i think she is so over confident and thats why she look ugly some time...
She has foundation on but she’s here to promote her own brand products that’s eyebrow pencil, eyeliner and lipstick.
Mam kia ap mujy makeup gift kr skti he mujy apka makeup bohat acha lga he
free of cost,do kaki madra breathing exercise for removing blackheads and dark circles,and increase face glow.
This is not an honest representation. She&#39;s wearing a professionally done base, she&#39;s got bronzer on already, her eyelashes look done. Also her eyeshadow was blended out off camera for that soft smoky look. Basically it&#39;s an ad for her products but getting it to look like hers needs tons of technique and skill.
Hi mam I am big fan of  you  mam
Indian ppl plz respect your country and stop promoting such randies in india...
Katrina from which country you r from...do they ppl know that you are keep of salman khan
Tooth brush hhhhhhhhhh....u don&#39;t have brushes
get free of cost face glow,do kaki madra breathing exercise daily,GUARANTEED ......

Wow... though she already had her foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, mascara, contour shade, lip colour, botox done on the face.. still she is fake applying  Infront of camera.i like the idea.... U r beautiful kat and clever too 😍
Hello nykaa.. make up was over all good keep it up katrina
Being a makeup addict you know what products are good &amp; must say.. SHE LAUNCHED THE WORST OF PRODUCTS. Very cheap products
0% pigment🤣🤣
Extremely beautiful naturally
Already  this is make  up
Katrina u have good sense of humour 👍🏻😂😂😂😂
She&#39;s already wearing a makeup like if u agree..
Pretty.. ☺.. Check mine too. U would love the contents. First video on 11  /8/20
After the surgery she looks funny... lol
Plastic surgeries Ka kmaal only Nd only ☹️😂😂😆😆😆😆😆😆
Wastage of time only 😒😒
I love u so much.......love it 😘😘😘
She looks okay to me not beautiful. It&#39;s what media has brainwashed us from years.
After putting on lots of make up she still couldn&#39;t hide her swelly cheeks. Without Salman her movies are flop. As said by director of Dabangg, I don&#39;t know of other celebrities fake their donations too.
Katrins is vvvv beautiful😍💓
U r just so perfect without makeup too
Am i the only one who is actually wondering about this makeup tutorial, makeup on makeup? And such a light to no makeup?
Ravishing
Wow you look so cute before the makeup 😍
One of the best products i ever have used, creamy soft and very very longlasting İ love the products💗 A beauty line just like herself “Perfect and Gorgeous”😍 Btw Thats very normal that she has a base already on her face cuz foundation is not launched yet👍🏻
Share with a skin and hair care routine
She is the ugliest Bollywood actress I have ever seen
I love her ....my fav katrina nd kangana
Beep for behind scene but not edit.
What happened to her English?
I love you Katrina 😘😘
Basically she is teaching how to do makeup after putting makeup ....
Amazing

Fake person n fake makeup

Make  up is an Art ......and it&#39;s  free   to try and have fun,<br>If it works good ....&quot;you are an artist&quot;,.💅<br>If it didn&#39;t  work .......🤞<br>&quot;You are pro artist....😝&quot;
Katrina has really raised the bar in the makeup industry. And for Nykaa any amount of appreciation is insufficient. Kudos to team Nykaa. And yes really admire Katrina more after launching Kay beauty. Love her strong entrepreneurial side apart from her acting abilities.
Kat please sadi Kar lo
Beauty 💛
Where is my salary?  <br>Oops, it’s showing in Nykaa’s balance sheet.
She is looking soo Georges 😍💖😍😍😍
She is soo Georges 😍😍👌

Katrina looks so beautiful naturally.... she doesn&#39;t need any makeup.  But this makeup is not so strong.  Its very good
Love you Katrina big fan of yours from the UK :) x
I haven’t tried much products... not a makeup person, but the Kajal and lip liners are probably one of the best I’ve used. The formula is so creamy and it glides in one go. Love it.
Keep posting kay beauty videos.. i love it
Looking soo Beautiful 😍😍

The lip liners are great! They glide so perfectly and create a natural smudgy look 😍
my eyes has the same shade naturally
Ohhhhhh wow, Katrina 😍😍😍😍

Why can&#39;t they just include a spoolie in the eye brow pencil? You won&#39;t need a toothbrush then🙄
Honestly Kay beauty is too expensive.. middle class girls like me can only enjoy by seeing the products than buying..
She is very beautiful and intelligent
She is cute. But i think she was so beautiful when she just got into movies like ajab prem ki gazab kahani and hum ko deewana kar gaye.. She was a bit chubby n beautiful.. No hate.. 🤗😍
Love you Katrina 😍😍😍😘😘😘😘
She is just owesome😍
