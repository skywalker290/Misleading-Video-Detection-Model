Clearly fake you can see the effects of a harness on her centre of gravity, then the camera pans away for her to come down you don&#39;t actually see her &quot; float&quot; down , yawn,  next
The lady was flying a kite and it looked like a little girl
Why was the man filming though?
blud went in creative mode
This is very natural and happens to people who know how to use the force and live in nature. If you live in the city and use these devices we use and internet all your psychic abilities shutdown from the radiation and chemicals in your city food. They don&#39;t want us to learn to teleport or fly because they want to control us and make us rely on their money-system that poisons our spirits.<br>If we can let go of our modern comforts... and live away from society in nature, whence we came, real majik comes alive.
ahhhh
this is going to give me a nightmare
The mother and child never looks at the guy or dog how odd
So fake its cgi
She got possessed someone call the priest

Its a fucking sacrifice
She was a fairy

The tree on the right is a Hazelnut, those long thin fishing pole type branches sticking up are the branches of a young Hazelnut tree, this is the way they grow at first for all that&#39;s worth!
The little girl is clearly just a cleverly painted balloon.
I believe I can fly, I believe I can touch the sky
People are not ready to accept something that&#39;s out of their comprehension. Telling others to believe just leads to self distress. If something can&#39;t be proved, doesn&#39;t means it can&#39;t exist. Moreover, can quantum mechanics be explained today? The laws that apply to our physical world doesn&#39;t apply to quantum world, we can&#39;t even understand gravity. For what we need, is to broaden our horizons, and embrace all possibilities!
hey fun fact : IT&#39;S NOT REAL!! if Ozzy and jack call it out and Jack is a certified Paranormal investigator and i seen on tv yestrday on paranormal captured on camera...

U people need to get it straight the film is ligit look thr <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=63">1:03</a> ough the frame on by one it takes time but if u r in to paranormal  u need to do your homework like evey good thing takes time they r so called aliens but u can clots of faces remember in the lord because the shit is going to hit the fan an u no what happens when the shit hits the fan. Everyone ducküò¢
IO mean, I never seen such natural acting and the dog is crazy. As for the &quot;cables&quot; they can&#39;t be since they aren&#39;t straight it&#39;s vegetation. I agree the guy is both convincing in itself that he could have missed her landing, but also that it&#39;s so perfectly timed so we miss it.... AAAAAAH. I don&#39;t necessarily believe or anything, so don&#39;t call me gullible, please. Did anyone see a group of people act so naturally in such extraordinary circumstances... AS for &quot;erasing cables&quot; it&#39;s not as easy as it appears. These people are very talented if it&#39;s a fake, but did it ever was explained like whom did profit from it, besides tabloids, maybe.
My girlfriend said something and all these years I never thought of it.<br>It&#39;s the Mother raising the child through tk
Is more cursed the way the camera moves that the child itself.
Funny how the vid is cut from floating to running off ... No landing footage .
vids def fake
Min .55 you can a smoky figure that is in front of the little girl
I was expecting the ad: Redbull gives you wiiiiingsss
No Idea Man
Creepy, but unconvincing. <br>Doesnt seem like any good reason to be filming a dog, especially to continue after it bolts. Theres clearly a cut in film between the girl levitating and the girl after shes been lowered to the ground.
People From 5th Planet from the SUN Asteroid Belt of Today the Planet Blowup and it Core got in Earth Orbit  It Earth Moon of Today &amp; It at Escape 5th Planet Went to Russia and In the Earth 300 Miles There is Spinning Global In the Earth with Atmosphere Remember Little Fly Girl on Youtube In Russia It Time for at Little Girl Stargate Through Earth Surface .I Think Putin Know of Them In Earth Hollow Earth
She might be a potential Gravity Shifter‚Ä¶.
dog ran away, sometime their women catch the girl is float away? üò∞
It&#39;s 2023 (5.29.23 to be exact), where is the girl now? Trapeze artist in a circus? Partying and floating at a rage? In a gov. lab being studies? Oh where Oh where has that little girl gone..Oh where..Oh where can she beee??!?ü´£üòù <br>Shame on the guy that recorded this...for not investigating and giving us updates...üò´üò†üòÜ
This is what makes me believe that UFO abductions are happening for a reason and someone like that is the reason &amp; they sre in search of a human with any knowledge of DNA that can substain life beyond the planet earth but space and other planets and its hard and takes time to find 1 person ina multi billion populated planet
Oh that&#39;s cute.
they were filming a movie -- there were cables tied to the trees do do this part
Its just the end of the a movie when they jump in the air
In just one frame, I swear I see a wire, stretching from behind her overhead, to in front of her and off screen.
Sure, this is likely fake but it was one of the first &quot;creepy&quot; and &quot;unexplained&quot; videos to pop up and really get attention. While I don&#39;t believe the video is real or will always be one I remember fondly.
What I don&#39;t like about this is that we don&#39;t see her come down to the ground.
Oh hey it‚Äôs Psycho Mantis
I think it‚Äôs bullshit, probably has a balloon in her jacket or been photoshopped I don‚Äôt believe it for a second
It&#39;s already been proven fake. If you upscale the fps it looks like she&#39;s dangling from a rope.
I call bs. 1. The mother didn‚Äôt hear all the yelling for his dog and stomping around? 2. The photographer lost her from his shot the moment she came down, which her descend would have given away the ‚Äútrick.‚Äù<br>All said, I also do believe that this is 100% possible.
Middle of the woods, quiet as all hell, and they don&#39;t hear the dog or the guy calling the dog.  Yeah ok.
If you look carefully from around the 27second mark you can see the outline of a human shape of which she is in the arms of, I can&#39;t see what else the shape could be a part of, it looks free-standing to me - and playing with his/her/other little friend  in the woods - this is perhaps a tree spirit? Perhaps one of the undiscovered yet very real undocumented natural entities? Dimension drifter? Or is she other wordly?!
Too bad we didnt get to see how she came down. She could of been balancing on a stick or something. I thought I heard the theme song to &quot;The flying Nun.&quot;
I&#39;ll have whatever shes&#39;s on!
The little girl was so happy, she was dancing on air.
If you read the Ringing Cedars series of books, you will read the story of Anastasia. This is who I believe is in this video with her daughter. The series is written by Vladimir Megre.

Levitation is real. It&#39;s a spiritual and energetic phenomenon, mostly achieved through meditation. It&#39;s been done by Christian saints, by buddhist and hindu monks and many more people throughout history. Some children actually have a natural gift for it. There&#39;s many more videos of it on the internet.
Almost all my life I&#39;ll have this dream that I could start running then jump in the air and fly and my hands could control my speed and how high I can go like it was normal for me.<br>I don&#39;t know why the dreams seemed so real.

But how don‚Äôt they here him initially call for his dog. He was talking kind of loud.
You walk up on something like that an the idiot cant keep the camera straight.
Crissy wake up I didn‚Äôt like crissy wake up
Where the dog go to and why the camera pan at that crucial momentü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è weird AF tho if real
If you run this in slow motion frame by frame you can see a beam of light that comes down with an apparition that appears walking in the brush. The little girl was slapped in the face from a demonic entity. The dog seen it and that‚Äôs why it ran, switched his mind and ran the other way! <br><br>Anyone watching this has to watch Trey Smith ‚ÄúDemon RUNS after levitating a child‚Äù on youtube about this. üíØ
bella and renesme lol
is quite common in russia.
Title Russia<br><br>Me okay i know what&#39;s going on
girl has entered creative mode
I think this video is fake because why didnt she pull the child down as soon as the dog ran over???.. you can clearly hear his big feet in the snow lmao.. also the video moves down at the most convenient point, when the child is disconnected from whatever is holding her up. Im sure there are people that can levitate, I just dont think this one of them.
Bro got 999ms

Ik nobody would believe me, but I was that little girl once. I remember vividly when I was around 5 years old, I jumped off my bed but I stayed up in the air. I was doing flips, pushing against the wall, all of it. I even remember showing my parents. They looked at me with so much surprise. My entire life I grew up thinking that it was a dream, but when I told my parents the ‚Äúdream‚Äù I remember having, both of their mouths dropped in unison. They went ‚ÄúI remember.‚Äù
11 was there.
Tarzan for a dog lol
Proof that super powers exist: This Video<br>Girl: I BELIEVE I CAN FLY I BELIEVE I CAN TOUCH THE SKY
I remember when I was like 10 and was really into paranormal and creepy stuff, as well as into aliens. <br><br>This was one of the first paranormal videos I remember watching and I was so amazed and scared, and yet so disappointed when I found out it was fake a few years later
Flying girl meets mother Russia.
Cool video, but I call hoax on it. Most telling thing is he lowered the camera for a split second, plenty of editing tricks one can do to sell the illusion.
video looks convincing but as usual these types of videos are not always grainy and not focused good
hmmm, I want to believe, if you go to 22 secs in and freeze it frame by frame, It appears that there is no girl there, and then the girl just fades in.  ?? I don&#39;t know what to think.
it looks like woman teach that girl flying. Someone explain that?
That&#39;s Putin and Donald Chump
she be taken by vecna
Renesmee and Bella
What type of potato was this recorded with?
Eric cartman and Kenny south park
Pretty sure the lil girl is being held in some gvmnt facility by now..smh..sad
Whats creepy is the light circling her.  Seems to knock the girls head back when it passes her.  Js!!
I hate to break the news to the believers, but people can&#39;t float.
hoax
After hearing the clock ticking
Tontooo!! No fuiste corriendo detr√°s de ellas idiota
Purely fake the guy with cam never run to follow those mother in child ....that&#39;s my family actuallyü§£üòÅüòÖüòÇ
i blame vecna
&quot;Running up that road running up that hill&quot;
I‚Äôm in the woods with my dog. For no reason I think I shall start recording.
Why if this is in Russia - with a Russian filming this, does he speak to his dog in English?  Kinda odd‚Ä¶ did he think ‚ÄòWhen I upload this on YouTube, I better do it in a language widely understood‚Äô?  Is so, then this does raise questions about the authenticity of this footage.
Even Hollywood has to do the weird camera drop to hide transitions like the girl floating down
i can‚Äôt remember if it was my hyperactive imagination (which I was never very imaginative growing up), or maybe some lucid dreaming, but I have vague memories of floating in the air like that as a kid, but it was hard, and it took a lot of energy. And then when I first saw this video was when I was already in middle school, and I didn‚Äôt think it was all that creepy, it just struck a memory.
As obviously staged as this video is, it&#39;s really well done and almost convincing.
I...I want to believe but I just can&#39;t
It was a costume with helium and a wig  to think its a child, so Camara man cuts so the real kid comes out and leave...
If she didn&#39;t want to be seen, why are they wearing an orange and red coat?
This inspired the foo fighters to write a song
I can&#39;t believe this many ppl are this gullible. They will believe in nonsense like this but yet they won&#39;t believe in Jesus Christ.
It&#39;s another fake video, they all knew one another and decided to screw with everyone&#39;s mind.
Flying like an angel
It‚Äôs fake. Watch the head seem to bend matter.
Super fake
Doubt she could have run far with a young child, unless they both flew off lol. Shame he did not catch them.
P.S. there is a pair of white eyes or car lights in the forest past little red flying hood lol
Does anyone else see the long wispy spirt looking &quot;rope like thing&quot; moving back and forth right around the little flying girl? Any thoughts on that?
No one sees a ghost with a staff.   Walking under the girl
Totally not a hoax üòÖ
This s*** is fake as hell
This is legit because running and disappearing into the woods without the cameraman following them is normal
Fake video all the way
Nah man that‚Äôs just my sister that visited Russia , my apologies I will drop kick her.
Legal ela conseguiu.
That dogs sooo pretty. HI TARZAN
Aliens started to abduct the child clearly the dog and man cut the aliens ET off üëΩüëΩüëΩ
This video looks extremely legit I have been viewing it since I was 13 years old and what&#39;s most convincing is it appears her clothing is floating aswell.
lmao
Telekinesis Every Body Have It But Do Not How Use It
She&#39;s just floating around, but would like to see her how she landed. Why are these videos always such horrible quality? ‚òπ
Just happened to be there at the right time huh..
Funny how the kid hits the deck while his camera is pointing downwards
To many redbulls
Really cool, but, we know that humans cannot fly, so..
Where did the dog go? He races straight towards the girl and woman, yet when the recorder goes around the corner and sees the females, the dog‚Äôs nowhere in sight. The females should have reacted to a running dog racing towards them.
hahahaha nice actingüëåüëåüëå
You can see something in the background I wouldn&#39;t doubt if it was real with all the things they are finding out about quantum mechanics tieing in closer and closer to meta physics there&#39;s a reason why witchcraft was outlawed at one point because it actually worked
This is staged/faked.
Well, vid starts with dog acknowledging the ppl off to the side. Then runs to them. Most likely bc theyre family. Father, mother, daughter and dog. Nobody seems to be excited for such an apparent miracle. Kid &amp; mom and even the cameraman  dont make a peep. Nor does the mom or kid reach out for eachother.  Idk about u, but i have 4 kids and each one would be rather vocal and animated if such an event were to occur.  Vid becomes shaky and kid is now down. They then run into the bush instead of out or towards someone for help. Oh, and how convenient that he was recording such a mundane event.... playing fetch with his dog just as it occurs. I watched in slow mo and the number, &amp;  size of trees appear to change behind the child. But that could just be due to quality.   Too many questions tho. But it was a well done effect. Just my 2 cents worth of observation. id have to go with hoax.
Witchcraft is real.
It&#39;s Russia, that&#39;s normal over there...
Yea probably a hoax but would be fucking cool if real
He missed the 3rd conclusion: fake. If anyone could levitate on this planet, thereby upending all known laws of physics (we‚Äôd have a paradigm-shift if it were proved), we would‚Äôve known about it, and known about it under rigorous test-conditions. There‚Äôs a reason why no one ever claimed James Randi‚Äôs jackpot money offer to anyone who could prove their ‚Äòsupernatural‚Äô skills under test conditions.
Flat gravity theorists finally have their smoking gun.
All I have to say beware of the craft. Gifts come in many forms üòå
Is it magic or is she a mutant or an alien??? She can&#39;t be a normal human if this video is real
They would have heard the man calling the dog the woman or the child never even turned around to look why is that they just ran off don&#39;t believe this
I wanna fly ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
I got so high in the woods today.
I wish I was her daughter
I mean, what&#39;s the reason to start filming if u didn&#39;t know that there is an levitating girl =_=
Tbh the clip is kinda creepy, but kind 60% fake
An regular day in Russian. BUT WHAT DOG NAME IS TARZAN
Gawd damn witch. üòÇ
Gravity to that girl:  <b><i>Bruh am i a joke to you</i></b>
Only in Tschernobyl
Kokkain is a hell of a drug
Maybe they&#39;re both witches
What&#39;s so creepy is how the parent is looking at the child doing it like they&#39;ve seen it happen before‚Ä¶
That‚Äôs where my red flag goes up on and a kid is levitating
The logical question is. Why is he randomly recording the dog In The woods?
And that floating girl is actually dua lipa<br><br>&quot;You want me, I want you, baby<br>My sugarboo, I&#39;m levitating&quot;
Who is still here for 2021
The strange thing is the girl did not hear the man.
Probabley a jetpack or a rope
iv have come to the conclusion that its 1.witchcraft, 2.Glitch in the Matrix Like Neo, 3.not human
Nothing just gravity is with Putin üòÅüòÇ
Lmao
there&#39;s something weird going on with the little girl&#39;s head at the thirty second mark
I always use my broomstick
A fairly good attempt at deception. In order to create a natural narrative , the guy ‚Äò innocently ‚Äò walking his dog leads the camera into the scene. It‚Äôs an attempt to suggest that he accidentally stumbled across the two of them as opposed to staging the thing.
So, the kid kept levitating and the mom kept looking at her flying daughter even when the dog ran towards them and the guy was yelling and running behind the dog. The only thing that stopped the girl and the mother was dog&#39;s barking!!!! Why didn&#39;t they stop when the dog ran towards them?
Wonder where that girl are right now
I watched this 9 years ago on world star hip hop
The dog&#39;s name is Tarzan
Did those come from you or did you make them from scratch?
Nine years still no explanation
Just a normal day in Russia...
Dang will we ever know who the mom or kid was and if they been found or talked to about how that girl was flying any info anybody?
Pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=6">0:06</a> the footprints are facing the wrong way and there&#39;s a ton of them.. He&#39;s already been in the background setting this up.
This is like the qurik float in my hero academia all might teacher have this qurik
2021 and i just found out about this
I have watched countless videos on YouTube concerning paranormal activities, and all videos are not clear, or at a crucial point in the video - the person video recording starts to F up the recording by recording to the ground, to the right, to the left, the sky, but never, ever do they stay focused on the subject!!  Shit man!
The daughter let me type in gamemode creative
All jokes aside, that&#39;s some serious shit.
Tonza üêï seen something an felt that thing That‚Äôs why he clearly kept running
Things like this are possible and real. Humans don‚Äôt know how powerful they really are..
Fake af
This is why you don‚Äôt play with witchcraft..., she‚Äôs damned her young innocent daughters soul...
Don‚Äôt be afraid, it‚Äôs just a girl practicing witchcraft with her mom
Plot Twist: That mom is a Stand User
So nobody sees like a face turning towards the camera at the last second?    If you look at her head you‚Äôll notice something turn towards the camera‚Ä¶
Some vids of this event I can see a transparent entity that looks similiar to the demon on Dios holy diver album cover other times I can&#39;t. Trey smith has a good commentary video about this.
Everything is possible when you have family<br>-Dom
What interests me about this video is the frame at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=34">00:34</a>. Either the phone shorted out, or this is evidence of a very well done cgi and it was done for effect.
At 30 sec you can see the guy going across with the rope like 2 or 3 times. They try to blur the video.
That would be so easy to fake and I love the cut scene when he hangs out the weeds they lower the girl from the wire and then the girl and the woman are in place when he filmed them the second time just in time for them to run off what a fraud
Always shitty quality
What&#39;s so creepy is how the parent is looking at the child doing it like they&#39;ve seen it happen before‚Ä¶
I believe it&#39;s real.. People fear what they don&#39;t understand so they try to debunk it or come up with some stupid ass explanation or a corny ass joke. The fact of the matter is there are things that exist beyond our imagination and not everything is fake. The fact that we share space with so many different intelligent beings anything is possible.
The girl is just very high i gues...
bad actors. fake set up. why would that guy be filming his dog&#39;s disobedience?
I blame witchcraft<br><br>-salem: sometime in the 1000&#39;s
Has this been put through forensic analysis?  I don&#39;t see any wires or anything but there&#39;s only so much the naked eye can see.
TARZAN COM HERE!
you can tell its a hoax bc the camera shakes right at the moment she comes down. if we could see that, it would probably reveal whatever contraption was holding her up there
Seems to be a pivot point noticeable, if she was worried about being seen, the dog approaching would have been a major
Have you ever you gotten so mad at someone you wanted to make them slowly float to space with no way of then returning
Thats just esme trying to fly with edward.
Nice try! If u pause it &amp; zoom in you can clearly see something tugging/pulling on the back of her coat like she was tied or hung from something..
Fake Fake Fake...
It&#39;s Russia, what did you expect<br>Pffft You can have a nuclear plant in your morning tea
Others: strange<br>Me: ay take a better camera

In Russia everything is possible.
Which craft
Nevermind that obvious harness on the girl, the third person seen lowering the girl or the 2 second pause for mom to be detached girl from the lift and yes very magical!!!
Child.... i bloody told you not to suck the helium out of your birthday ballons..... Seriously though if it is real and it could be..... There are certain Jinn that can fly... Maybe they are into the occult and have summoned a demonic spirit. At a price may i say.
For such a crazy tape, the comments are gold
my theory:<br><br>the women/girl were doing witchcraft in the forest where nobody would see them (they might have been practising levitation spells or charms ect.)<br>when the girl was floating the women saw the guy recording and quickly some how got  her down in fear they would be discovered to be witches.
Russia being Russia
You can see the back of her jacket being pulled to a point and she‚Äôs struggling to stay level. This is faked.
Fuck off üòÑ
Its edited when the camera shakes just after they&#39;re seen.
Fake
everyone commenting on this things its scary or witchcraft i think its beautiful and maybe somewhere out there that child will remember her experiance and tell someone how she did that i believe that she really can fly
Cant you tell shes in creative?
No you! üëä
Mabye its powers some get from that nuclear bomb that went off years ago
Tarrrrsan cam yer
It‚Äôs sooooooo fakee
She using gmc(game mode creative)
damn X-Men exist and i didnt even know it
RedBull make you fly lol
These are his f0cking wife and his stupid child, and the video is so fake as a plastic tomato real tomato salad can be.
Why didn&#39;t they just float away instead of running?
~this is perfect~this is what our children should learn then they would know independence~the day I can do this money is obsolete and so is the material world~now that is what I call a kundalini arising~you GO GIRL!!!!!~
that was a tree that was hanging her i think-
BLAIR WITCH FUCKING SHIT
i would have ran after them HOW THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT!
In mother Russia. We teach the birds how to fly
Damn kids keep flying on this man&#39;s land!<br><br><br>Also, I think he either caught a witch or a possession happening.
You talk to dogs in English in Russia?  Dogs in Russia deserve some serious praises
Aliens can roam around looking similar to how we look and you wouldn&#39;t even notice them as aliens....  Also watch Dr Charles Hall interview about dreamland aka area51. He mentioned how alien use to bring their kids to play and fly around outback with a human girl who was the daughter of one of the Generals.. real true story
Its clearly fake. You can see how the video cuts off before the mom &quot;catches&quot; the girl. Its defs special effects
Why is she learning how to fly on the third dimension?  Wiches fly on the fourth, not on the third not be caught!
Oh
Holy shit
Russian Speaking to his dog in English because he knows that he will upload the video on youtube , and make some money with !! the girl is certainly his daughter with his wife and they made this short syfy movie , they fixed it some how , there is invisible thine cables now ... it would be easy ... this is RussiaWood Not Hollywood lol
Life is Strange 2
Ghostly face on the left side of the video footage at :32
Why didn&#39;t we see her come down? The video seems to have been edited in that portion of the video. If I was walking in the woods and saw a girl in the air, I would have followed to ask what the he&#39;ll did I just see. Very strange the guy just said oh well, it was just a little girl floating in the woods and went on walking with his dog Tarzan. Sorry, I&#39;m not falling for this trickery.
Looks creepy huh, who Wonders which part of the forest they are hiding
Maybe it&#39;s witches, and mom training her child to fly?<br>And dog sounds like disturbed, maybe he scared? Because, I don&#39;t know, they are really witches? Animals clearly see and hear paranormal
Well, you wanted a pi√±ata for your birthday, didn&#39;t you??
Don&#39;t worry guys. Kid&#39;s just in creative mode.
Satan has left the chat.
T A R Z A N
I see a harness around her thighs, the guy taking video is in on it. Fake.
You could make a religion out of this.
How that kid fly
Looks so fake
Granger get your ass down from there and at Hogwarts now
They plant ketum very well there
I thk they aliens
Pussy had me floatin
I can fly too but for a short time. Then I hit the floor below the cliff :/
Blyat Witch Projekt!
Leave the them alone they were training
What a non stand user sees:
Just as they come into view you can tell they&#39;re far enough away to not hear him coming, and I don&#39;t see anything that she could be hanging from. Why is he speaking in English? Maybe Tarzan does&#39;t understand Russian...  and if it was fake, it seems odd that the woman would need to say something to the girl before running off.
Just lag guys dont worry
Are you all this stupid? First he&#39;s talking in English, why?<br>Secondly you can clearly see the wire connector in the back of her jacket. You can&#39;t see the wire itself but you can see under her coat its clearly some type of hook or harness underneath the backside of the jacket. When the dog barks he lowers the camera just for a split second then CUTS the film back to where she&#39;s now on the ground and they run off. LOL..................Bullshit hoax and a bad 1.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=26">0:26</a><br>*What every one thinks<br>‚ÄúIs a witch!! A witch!! Ruuuunn!!!‚Äù<br><br>*What I think about <br>‚ÄúStarts to playing the main theme from the X MEN cartoon‚Äù üß¨
Possible fake rewatched this a few times of the girl n her mum ran becos the dog came? .. why did they not run earlier? the dog was barking making Al sorts of noise the guy was calling tyson they should have heard  known someone was close by.. so since where been secretive they should have stopped as soon as they heard the guy calling they waited till the camera got its shots before running... For this I say possible fake or else it would be amazing to know that real super humans are out der..
Just a normal day in Russia
was this flim on a potato
So fake the person holding the camera is rattling it around like they stroking dick or fapping the bean bag.
BOY ITS EASY TO FLOAT JUST USE THE MINECRAFT LEVITATION POTION
I put this in alien video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHQMu7XFKIg">https://youtu.be/KHQMu7XFKIg</a>
I came here from a comment on a Harry styles vid and was not expecting this
If you slo-mo the video (setting on the bottom-right, Play Speed to 0.25, and keep stopping by space button), you can catch frames, what shows that, the woman with the kid helps to the ground the kid, by catching her / him by arms, and lifting down to the ground.<br><br>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=58">0:58</a> , there is a frame, where the kid is in her hands, not on the ground, like a woman holding her kid in arms, then helps the kid to legs, a few frames later. So the kid comes down from air to the arms of the woman, then the woman let the kid to the ground onto own feet.
I&#39;ve seen this video clip a hundred times or more....¬†¬† on 6 or 8 different TV shows, the Internet, my phone&#39;s¬† Youtube app and each time, felt that &quot;something was wrong&quot; in it!¬† Then I watched it again a while ago, on TV&#39;s &quot;Paranormal: Caught on Camera&quot; and finally GOT IT.... with &quot;it&quot; being: &quot;What is wrong with this picture&quot; (or video)!<br>¬† First, if you want to practice your super secret flying skills, you&#39;d go into the REAL FOREST, just beyond the recently timbered, open area They ARE Using!<br>¬† Next, BEING in the now open &amp; recently timbered area, Sound Carries WELL and with our phone toting comrade talking, calling and whistling to his dog, I believe the child and her Babushka, would most definitely HEAR HIM Coming their way, and quickly....¬† fly off!<br>¬† Then, this video is &quot;Supposed To&quot; Be from deepest, darkest Russia!¬† First, THERE&#39;S SNOW!!!¬† Anything about Russia that&#39;s on TV, is gonna have lottsa SNOW!<br>¬† Then, there&#39;s the feeling that you&#39;re somewhere remote!¬† There&#39;s a lot of background noise, but you cannot tell WHAT it&#39;s from!¬† A Rail Yard?¬† An Airport?¬† A Shopping Mall?¬† The WIND?¬† You just cannot tell what all that sound is from!<br>¬† Then there&#39;s our Russian Comrade and his loyal hound... &quot;Tarzan&quot;?¬† Is Tarzan a traditional Russian name?<br>¬† Anyway, our comrade Calls to his loyal companion IN ENGLISH?¬†¬† He&#39;s ALL ALONE.... deep in the Russian wilderness and he&#39;s talking to his dog IN ENGLISH?<br>¬† Is it an English Lap Dog....¬† or a Cockney Spaniel?¬† Is &quot;Tarzan&quot; a Hollywood Hound?<br>IF Truly &quot;ALONE WITH HIS DOG&quot;, why is this Russian speaking English to his dog, unless the video was INTENTIONALLY MADE, FOR AN &quot;ENGLISH SPEAKING AUDIENCE?&quot;
It&#39;s Russia...
She may well be stuck on the branches of that leafless tree for all you know ... üôÑ
Wow i can believe how blind everyone can be even when the proof is right in front of them , the girl IS levitating!

So fake it&#39;s funny
It&#39;s only world glitch
recording man:OMG WTF HOOOOW? kid:am i joke to you?
Shes just in creative mode
Fake. !!!
What else has been taken from us. ?
Saw this on paranormal caught on tape. So thought I&#39;d search it
I would love to know the story behind this there&#39;s been nothing like it since.
Is taht real ?:0
That&#39;s edited
This a hoax they had to have heard him yelling at dog they were few feet away would have took off faster if this was real
Are the producers of &quot;Blair Witch&quot; at it again?
Cant stop them getting high on mushrooms in the woods..
Just a forest witch and her daughter. No big deal
So, if the dog is running towards them in the video, then where did the dog go? Wouldn&#39;t it be right there barking at them?
could b a saint n tha making....alot of a saints come outta Russia....(if this is a genuine vid).....the dog even seemed spooked....they were prob meditating &amp; couldnt hear the dog till it got up close...
The little girls hair is somehow being pulled upwards ?? Not just from the back of her jacket ? Strange
Seriously? Are there no genuine comments here discussing about this?
Not the only one in the world!‚ôé‚ôë‚ôí‚ôì‚õé‚ôåüõê
so fake, but let&#39;s just say your child floats up but stays within reach,  ANY mother would be holding on to her for dear life ,not doing nothing, stupid.
The dog disappeared. It would have gone straight to the little girl if this was real. So dumb
She is on RED BULL!
Glitch

All fake edited video
Who‚Äôs here from Captain D‚Äôs video?
I do love the comment section of nearly every video, the whitty banter makes it a lot better.<br>I do also wonder how this video might real.
if you look close you can see the Lil girl breath you no when you breath out in the cold
imadgin if this was real tho
Fucking jokes everywhere, this shit seems hella serious &amp; concerning af
the kid was being question by a modern witch. perhaps that kid was kiddnap by this modern witchü§î
They got god and anime on there side
Camera turns away and next thing she is on the ground. HHHHHMMMMMMMMMMMM
Footage from 1687, moments before Issac Newton invented gravity
The reason they even allowed this video to be up is for people to get desensitize and not take it seriously . I believe this video is real and it&#39;s hard too believe things like this exist. So once it&#39;s really in our face people are not gonna care and fall for the devil trick&#39;s . Stay woke .
Man.....I really need to find some Russian dank.
old school stuff, thank youchurch for fucking us all up
Who or how do they know it was a girl... ? Fuck them hoes ... that‚Äôs what I say ...
HOAX!!! Few reasons why: Guy is yelling his dogs name constantly rather loudly and should of gotten the attention of both kid and adult easily. Also frames are missing you cannot see the kid land on the ground properly and aswell as why would the adult be holding the kid like that if the kid is the one floating back to ground, that makes no sense. Video quality is also horrible so that doesnt help either
Can a russian speaking person be so kind and translate what the man is saying? unfortunately he isn‚Äôt talking english all the time...
Lol twilight  lol
I believe the World is laggie
gravity is capitalist propaganda
Idk because if she was hanging from something her legs would be dangling but instead she actually looks like she&#39;s floating apose to hanging

only time ive seen true physical levitation was when i met a legitimately possessed woman in louisiana at her creepy ass house. never went back.
Pause at @:33 and look at the fussy tree branch that crosses the image and the white blur by her feet, it&#39;s a bad photoshop job with a man holding a pole or guiding a cable that&#39;s been brushed out (for the most part). There are logs on the ground, so quite likely also a a winch line to move them. The guy just starts to become visible as the edit cuts away. Check out the two white blurs where his hands would be (are). HE MAY EVEN HAVE A LONG WHITE BEARD....don&#39;t believe me, why does the tee branch disappear when they cut back to her on the ground?
What
Why you don‚Äôt follow after them. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so can you trying talk with the girl.
<b>looks like Sharon took the kids again</b>
The girl look possessed...pay close attention

I wish I could fly dangit &gt;:V
there is no way a fat MoMA &amp; little girl can out run a 4 legged dog. case closed.
Why did the guy holding the cam lower the cam when the girl dropped?
wonder if someone on earth right now really could fly..
FAKE FAKE FAKE
I can see little white shadow below this girl
Mutants are among us.
as no one seen the the apparition walking through her look and stop the footage at 0.29 take it step by step through to round about 0.30 - 0.31 there are roughly 3 to 4 frame movements to each second so you will have to do it as slow as you can it&#39;s waking back behind the girl where her legs are.
Sounds more German than Russian
She‚Äôs clearly stuck in a tree people and who doesn‚Äôt run when a strange dog is running after them?
C&#39;mon darling, let&#39;s go outside and fly a kite! Mommy where&#39;s the kite?  Oh, I forgot to tell you something honey; you&#39;re the kite! Buahahaha!
I mean the cut away alone proves this is fake. Smh.
<b>great Peter Pan inspires kids to fly who else are we gonna catch, Dora?üòí</b>
If you look very closely at the jacket, you will see a bulge around her back where there is a harness that is being blurred by a post-editing program like After Effects.  This is corroborated by the forest area above this bulge, where you see some movement that looks like more shoddy blur-out/cut-paste movement to hide wires.<br><br>What makes it authentic is the very &quot;organic&quot; nature of it.  The blurriness, the &quot;serendipity,&quot; the anonymous mother and daughter.  But it&#39;s not believable to have &quot;no reaction&quot; from the camera holder, and of course it &quot;cuts&quot; to the scene where she&#39;s taken down from the harness by a sudden camera movement.<br><br>It&#39;s quite well done, however‚Äîbut still doesn&#39;t pass the eyes of a video editor. ;)
she can&#39;t fly away because she doesn&#39;t have an authorisation and an engine maybe diesel one
in Soviet Russia, gravity obey you.
I Soviet russia.  gravity obey you.

Why would a Russian be speaking to his dog in English?  It would be like me speaking Korean or Japanese to my dog in a video I was sure was going to post to this specific country sites.
You don&#39;t see how she comes down to the ground. The guy lowers the cam when the dog barks and after he points it back, the girl is already back on solid ground...
That&#39;s not flying! That&#39;s falling with style.
Where did Tarzan the dog go? he was close enough to be seen somewhere in the video after running toward the lady and child, but you don&#39;t.
Two lumps on the back of her jacket.......mystery solved
Why is a Russian calling to his dog in English?
Tarzan;  the dog was very close to them. How come the mother and daughter did not react to the noise of the dog running around in snow?  They only reacted when the dog ran back to its owner and barked. That‚Äôs another thing, why didn‚Äôt the dog bark when he was closer to this floating girl?
Who walks around filing their dog in the woods alone?  People who are setting up a hoax, that&#39;s who. lol
This video is staged and fake for so many reasons. He‚Äôs speaking English to his audience and they would‚Äôve heard him yelling for his dog a mile away. It is a fraud
Why is this secluded Russian citizen speaking English? That is suspect
Guy and dog are in on it....when girl comes down camera points down then back up. Hmmmm
Is that big foot in the background?  Behind the floating girl. I&#39;ll bet that&#39;s what Tarzan was chasing!
Look closer in the woods at the lower right while shes levitating, theres a light reflection there but when he moves the camera around it&#39;s at the top and the girl stops levitating and the light is gone
The lack of exasperation of the guy taking the video immediately begs it to have been staged. I would have shouted out What The Fuck!
If its a hoax, how can both her feet lifted as well? Mostly horizontal ehh
Okay so I totally Google everything and found a link where this video is discussed.  It&#39;s determined to be a hoax.<br>Here&#39;s some of what I read.<br><br>&quot;This is laughable! The setup is very ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù as he comes across the girl when filming the dog. The resolution is just enough to see the effect but not the details.<br>Other observations: The people are not far away, how can you NOT hear the dog and man? You do not see the girl coming down. She‚Äôs not flying but levitating in one place. No one can levitate for real but why would you do this out in the woods? It‚Äôs a well worn pathway that, obviously, people frequent. I‚Äôve spent too much time thinking about this‚Ä¶<br><br>UPDATE: (15-Apr-2012) Whoopsy, looks like this was an oldy from 2009. And, it‚Äôs pretty much been established as a hoax since people have spotted a harness. Yet, Boing Boing had picked it up so that‚Äôs why it got new life. Sorry about that. It was fun anyway.&quot;<br><br>I really wanted to believe this one but now I&#39;m convinced it isn&#39;t real.
Just a average russian kid
My sciance teacher told us about this video.
apparitions very good view at 31 sec. you can see beam of light go straiggt through her
I KNEW the Russians were messing with gravity.  <br><br><br>That&#39;s the only possible explanation for how hard it&#39;s become to climb the stairs lately!
I think the little girl is a kite. Notice how her head bends completely sideways at one point. People can&#39;t do that. Then they cut to the real girl walking. Good job tho!
That&#39;s weird! Has anyone tried finding these people?
It‚Äôs fake guys üí™üèª
There is an entity walking left and right it&#39;s barely visible , but u can see when the dog barks the entity runs to the left ..
Can you read my mind?<br>Do you know what it is you do to me?<br>Don&#39;t know who you are<br>Just a friend from another star.<br>Here I am, like a kid at the school<br>Holding hands with a god or a fool<br>Will you look at me, quivering,<br>Like a little girl, shivering,<br>You can see right through me......... lmao
he said something along the lines of &quot;oh my god what did you do&quot; at the end
That girl is about age (7-9)
Holy crap! I have watched this video over and over for the past two days, wondering how they faked this and I‚Äôm not seeing at all that they did. This is a legit kid ‚Äúhovering‚Äù in the damn air man!! I play/paused the vid like every .5 second or so and did several screen shots.... What makes me wonder if it is a fake, is that at the very beginning for about 2 second (when I paused) the woman is the only one standing there, nothing is in the air where we should see the little girl, then again she cld be just blurred from the bad pixel position. Anywho, this is really strange. <br>What also makes it look real is that at the end after cam man disfocuses on them and then looks back, I paused it several times and screenshot the woman with the girl in her arms (little girls head is above moms) like she grabbed her out of the air as she was coming down. <br>Witchy ass shit man!!
She tripped and forgot to fall (Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Universe  = How to fly).

Unfortunately I can&#39;t imagine if you&#39;re walking through the woods, and saw that, that you&#39;d immediately zoom in on it. I personally think that seeing something like that in person, you wouldn&#39;t be focused on the camera footage. You would probably be thinking wtf is going on. wtf am I seeing - you know?
The only scary thing is the description&#39;s spelling
I think ü§î this little girl is neither a star children or a ghost little girl and her mother cuz I don‚Äôt see any strings attached to her plus no one can un attached that quickly run away saw Appellation of little girl and mother run away in to the woods ...

They are aliens?
it&#39;s industrial strength fishing string, they cut it the moment the camera looked away from the girl.<br><br>If it was real, the guy filming would have made the video much longer, and he would have talked about it on video afterwards. <br><br>I mean, think about it.<br>if you filmed this, wouldn&#39;t you interview yourself on camera explaining what you saw in the woods. <br><br>There is no interview, because the camera guy knows he&#39;s not a good enough actor to pull off a fake interview about this event.<br><br>All the supernatural videos on YouTube are super short, with no interviews of the people that supposedly witnessed these events. <br><br>And the reason there are no interviews of these witnesses, is because they are not good enough actors to pull off sounding 100% honest and believable.

I think one rope is hanging her and her father is going to cut the rope by climb the tree . This is why the girl looking up and her mother also looking up then suddenly the father cut it and they saw a stranger and they run away

The supposley flying girl looks at the camera twice, while thew mother doesn&#39;t until she see;s the dog or hears the guy.  that sent up a red flag for me. although I am a big believer in phenomenal things. I am skeptic about this one
It&#39;s just a glitch, I think.

This is so fake and gay. The dog running to them would have startled them way before the dog started barking.

Conveniently slowed frame rate which claymation &amp; stop-frame photography can easily be disguised as. It is as easy to create this vid as it is to make an episode of Gumby. Just toss the kid up in the air &amp; use only frames where she is at the same height...then pattern them out in an animatory fashion. Basically this film is stop-photography made up to appear as a jutty frame-rate video.
Fakers uses camera shaking to make it harder to spot the fake. So I&#39;m really glad debunkers out there are using a stabilising technique to reveal how fake they are

Putin is responsible for this
Fake..the üêï tarzan takes off full speed at 18 sec..disappeared by 22 sec...the mother would have diffently seen and heard him coming..and is seen running back at frame 28 sec
Gotta love (or wonder) how people don‚Äôt even attempt to take the Supernatural seriously.  Especially a LOT of Bible-believing Christians!  The Holy Bible is full of Supernatural events, including a LOT of then things Christ, himself, performed!  We are living in a NEW Spiritual Age, one that was prophetic.  The Book of Enoch, backed up by Dead Sea Scrolls, (even though it wasn‚Äôt included in the final version of the Bible) was quoted throughout the OT and even by Jesus Christ himself and used by the early Hebrew scholars, states that the picture God painted for him, when bringing Enoch into the Spiritual realm (Heaven?), was for a long-away, future generation!  The Book of Enoch was penned over 2,200 years ago and when correlated with Holy Scripture prophecy, points directly to the generation that is on Earth today, RIGHT NOW!  Don‚Äôt believe what I say!  Check it out for yourself!  IMHO, we have entered a Spiritual Time in God‚Äôs history known as the ‚ÄúTime of Grace‚Äù.  A chance for nonbelievers to ‚Äúsee what is occurring‚Äù and check it out personally.  God would have that NONE be lost, but repent and believe in His Son, Jesus Christ and the power of His resurrection and that EVERYONE of His creation turn back to Him!<br>But, this ‚ÄúTime of Grace‚Äù is not long-lived and will end in but a few years!  Trust nothing, but search out the TRUTH!

nothing new here, just the usual levitation thing. everyone does that. move on
Maybe shes a fairy..
Absolutely, totally, utterly fake. Why?<br>1) If you can‚Äôt hear that guy screaming for his dog, and the dog running up to them, then you‚Äôre both DEAF, but MAINLY cuz<br>2) Notice how the camera mysteriously points to the ground and they are all out of view when it comes to her going from being in the air to on the ground? Why is that? Probably because you would see someone lowering her.. One second she‚Äôs in mid air, then the camera for some stupid reason starts pointing at the ground, and when he brings it back up, she‚Äôs on the ground running away. Yeah RIGHT
Ochako Uraraka, is that you?

Plot twist : <br><br>her mom perform an exorcism to kill her daughter using a ghost by hanging her daughter in the air and they was found by the dude<br><br>(this explain why they running away and the dogs bark just in time also the girl head looks pretty disturbed at some times) <br><br>I just turned this comment into a theory comment

This is the true Samanda in black ops we have to Find the true ester eggs guys !!
So all this time they didn‚Äôt hear the man calling his dog? Only when the dog barks then they get startled? It‚Äôs pretty quiet in the woods so any noise will be heard
Everyone who lives in Russia knows Putin controls everything - even the Laws of Gravity.
Kid:<br>&quot;Hold my bottle of milk, Dad, and watch this...&quot;
she&#39;s a Hacker
if you were russian and could understand and russian and moreover distinct the intonations of the voice and the way he is saying the words &quot;oh... god... what was that...&quot; you would understand that this is a fake. If only they could get a proper guy to say the words, i&#39;d even consider this being true... but after listening to the way he is saying what he is saying, I can tell you this is a BS
It&#39;s Russian witch training, you muggles!
If you ran to something the &quot;chockfactor&quot; would delay your actions thus &quot;zoom&quot; action would naturally be delayed, its not natural to be zooming in so quickly as if this &quot;zoom&quot; action was rehearsed to be part of the video
I Belive I can Flyüê¶
FAKE. Humans can&#39;t fly. Done. The end.
It&#39;s his wife and daughter. Cmon now, try again:
She tripped and got distracted.
Lol, thanks to the enhanced video YOU CAN SEE THE CORDS holding her up!
Obviously fake, why move the camera when she come down??? Wait there I know... Cos it&#39;s fake!!!
Obviously an inhuman or meta...
look for roundness of the head among the straight lines of the trees and go from there, freeze frame enough and look closely and you will see. must also believe in demons.
keep looking closely and see the demonic entity cradling her from a seated position holding her up with a smiling but sinister face.<br>Reply
Guys it‚Äôs real! I know bc my uncle works at Nintendo.
Meanwhile in Russia...
Why is the guy calling the dog come here and not  idi syuda ?I&#39;m just wondering.
its fake cuz of camera cut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=34">0:34</a>
You can clearly see red or pink harness about her legs...
The floor is not being able to drink vodka
It&#39;s jonbenet Ramsey.
There is a guy on youtube that picks this video apart frame by frame. There is actually a beam of light next to this girl. Scary stuff !
I&#39;m more curious as to why you called the dog Tarzan tbh.
para mi que si existen las personas que vuelan pq no eztamos solos en este planeta
THE NEXT SUPERGIRL<br>OR SUPERMAN<br>lol
Anyone else as turned on as I am?
it&#39;s harry styles....
fake af
If humans can&#39;t fly....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Can flies human???
Fake.
why did the guy speak english when it was filmed in russia?
Cute lil&#39; witch! Dang kids these days...
fake
this is mad
I watched the original over and over it is the weeds I am actually surprised you can clearly see the other weeds beside it out of focus exactly beside it at the same distance. I can&#39;t believe as well as you analyze that I can do better...wow you even made yourself see faces in everything dude...and the mom isn&#39;t screaming just staring and waiting...hmmm because she has to get ready to catch her of course so she doesn&#39;t get hurt. and the man isn&#39;t even surprised and the dog is just chasing the crew. it actually is fake....I know what I saw I can analyze VERY WELL and I&#39;m certain I watched it over and over you can even see the weeds before he zooms all the way in I mean come on.....this makes me angry at how these people fake this crap for money. I&#39;m upset
FAKE!
You guys need to watch frame by Frame starting 13 seconds in when the dog first runs toward the brush and you&#39;ll notice a cat like face forms from nothing - 2 eyes the nose most of the head and it spooks the dog who&#39;s sees it and stares right at it. When the dog runs away towards the little girl, you&#39;ll notice (again frame by frame) in the background behind the girl is a beam of light behind her coming from the sky and underneath her you can see an entity walking back and forth. It looks like a gray alien because well, that&#39;s what aliens really are. Demonic entities. They&#39;re levitating her
FAKE
I&#39;ve always thought the girl looked like she was swinging on a cable. She&#39;s not just floating she&#39;s hanging from something.
little kids are always hovering and flying around in old Russian fairy tales.
I wanna see the dog fly...
Red Bull lol <br>Love it
he would have gotten more footage is his dog didn&#39;t bark to see what was going on
Wow this was so easily faked. The levitating child was actually something like a small inflatable doll perhaps inflated with helium to make it super light. It was suspended from trees with something strong yet invisible to a poor quality camera eg fishing line. This gave the illusion of a child levitating. When the camera zoomed away there was a white flash which indicated that the film was paused in order to dispose of the doll and bring in a real kid to put the red coat on before resuming the film and zooming back to what is a child and parent fleeing the scene. You&#39;re welcome.
Tarzan!
0_0 I...I..I don&#39;t know what to say...uhh.
you can see demons in there and a big cats head thats why tarzna ran away
Red Bull
Fake. Der Mann und sein Hund waren viel zu nah dran an diesen beiden Personen. Die M√§dchen h√§tten auf jeden Fall geh√∂rt, wie er seinen Hund ruft. Au√üerdem ... Warum werden die beiden nicht auf den Hund aufmerksam? Dort liegen √ºberall Bl√§tter und Zweige, die knacken und rascheln, wenn etwas gro√ües wie ein Hund dar√ºber l√§uft. Und √ºberdies sieht das &quot;Schweben&quot; des M√§dchens √§u√üerst unnat√ºrlich aus. Ich bezweifle die Echtheit dieses Videos
HA LOL ERROR <br><br>LOL FAIL NAAAAA
I think its a fake , but a realy good one because the makers thougt about the cold air from the kids breathing .But look at the breathing fog from the kids are exact the same at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=50">0:50</a> .
fake because he starts at that certain point
Poor girl, looked all confuse, probably thought she was getting abducted by aliens
toi n√§ytt√§√§ ihan ilmapallolta mille on puettu vaatteet p√§√§lleüòÆ
very well... putin create New soldiers :&quot;v<br><br>perd√≥n por mi ingl√©s de mierda
the girl flying did not control I think that maybe someone controling her.
Fake they didn&#39;t hear him calling Tarzan ? But they heard Tarzan barking and then run away lol
why. was the guy filming himself out in the woods it&#39;s fake
gravity rush 2 looks great
Someone&#39;s been listening to too much R Kelly!! &#39;I believe I can flyyy!&#39;
<b>Blame Russian hackers...</b>
God dam kids
mee
All I can say is look at the little girl very carefully in front of her face at .30-.33 seconds. There is a wispy mist that just hangs in front of her face at .32, disappears, then it reappears and floats away from the face at .33. Her cold breath? No, not the way its was there, disappeared, then reappeared. Just look closely. I&#39;m leaning toward this being real spiritual/supernatural activity. And the dogs reaction is priceless.
BS,   the guy is calling his dog in English.... then when seeing the girl starts talking in Russian...
her rocking motion made me think theres a cable by her waistline, just my observation
Just thinking about it a little more, if all aspects of this footage could be verified as genuine then: <br><br>1.) This would have made world news. No doubt about it.<br><br>2.) It would have then been impossible for the girl and the other woman in the video to stay anonymous.<br><br>110% fake, IMO!
You have to ask yourself, why would a man, by himself, walking his dog, in the woods, take a video recorder? This to me is a greater mystery than the poor girl &quot;flying&quot; through the the air.
I also flew when pan threw a fairy dust on my body.
there is an entity walking left to right paceing with a line going back and forth actually knocks her hood of check out trey smith its so obvious you wont belive you missed it I can see it now in this clip clear  as day check it out wortwhile
So... MetaHumans/Mutants from X-men Exist.. Cool.
Tarzan
FOLLOW THEM!!
well know it all are out again think they have the answer and explanation, well folks you can clearly see its FAKE FFS Get a life the lot of you
the air is very thick there.
I refuse to believe this is real.<br>1. The guy&#39;s voice would be enough to startle those people in the first place when he said &quot;Tarzan&quot; specifically in this kind of forest.<br>2. I&#39;ll point out the fact that if they&#39;re about to do something supernatural like this, they&#39;re supposed to be wary enough and not to this in an open area and wearing bright colored jackets.<br>3.Guy supposedly filming the dog instantly directs on the mother and girl at the first turn.<br>4. Guys was not shocked &quot;enough&quot;  if it were real.<br>5. When the guy had shaken the camera that time when the dog barked is a little exaggerated and is meant to cover their setup. Anyone who&#39;s startled while filming will not actually flip the whole thing but enough to shake it while the facade still in view. hope you get what I mean.
they might went out to the woods to practice where it was quiet and no one to come across
I mean,anything is possible guys.
if it was a balloon tho, then why at the end of it she ran?
fake as fuck
fake. camera goes off the girl then when it comes back to view the little girl is on the ground. looks sketchy.
its not ballon because it when she landed on the ground her legs were moving and if it was a ballon it would have pop from all those branches and they could have not have strings the strings are to skinny they would break and and it have may been fake and or the little girl may done it herself or her mom may have lifted her and the little girl looked like she was look for something or someone and lol that girl was looking at her mom like get me the f down
its fake, theres a video
who else is here because of to ten
Guy: I think I see someone flying<br><br>Friend: Really<br><br>Guy: Yea<br><br>Guy: Get our worst camera And record this<br><br>Friend: Ok
when i sad drink vodka and fly i didint mean  fly like that
Using the video adjustments settings provided by YouTube, I slowed the video down to 0.25 and watched all the way through. the point where the girl takes her hood off, her head isn&#39;t there.
Wer ist wegen Jarow hier?üòÇüòÇ
Why are Russians always speaking  bad English? I mean, their country  is so big, there are lots of people in Russia. I&#39;m sure they learn many languages... but they don&#39;t?<br>Haha, i&#39;m not sure about asking this, because i&#39;m from Finland, the country, where Hydraulic Press Channel comes.
fake,fake,fake
And you thought Chernobyl wouldn&#39;t make stuff interesting
he should have mind his own business üòêüòêüòëüòåüòå
Haha so fake the camera man is the dad women is the mon the fly girl is there daughter. So the little girl has 4 string tight to her back. This is just a prank. You a can she&#39;s swinging left and right . There is one man on the tree has holding the string. I know this because we also do this at home my uncle was holding the string while I&#39;m flying. This is just a prank.
omg
ahh, she must have touched the Meteor like my cousin..
I stream too a 63 inch television.  With the video enlarged you can see a gray black figure kind of sitting facing her and supporting her through the air as she flies.
The girl isn&#39;t flying something invisible holding it &amp; the mom &amp; the girl can see that thing .Most probably that invisible entity  is the girl&#39;s father
If u see closly she is atuck on a branch
–ø–æ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏ –Ω–∏ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä–∏—è?
That&#39;s fake just saying and I&#39;ll tell you how so the kid is on a branch and when she falls he puts the camera down then he look up and then he stop the record when he could of follow them
Notice a huge puff of hot air repeal from her mouth right as she&#39;s dropped l
I think this is real I mean like wtf?! D:
I believe ican fly
it is fake people
Reasons this is fake:<br>A: They didn&#39;t hear him SHOUTING for his dog?<br>B: They &#39;jogged&#39; off. Like it was a fun thing to do-- What?<br>C: That&#39;s not flying, that little girl is on a wire =.=
in this frame ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=30">0:30</a>) is clearly hanging
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=35">0:35</a> is a dark shadow person&#39; in left backround!
Some people in comments said that he was speaking English, but it was 100% Russian. Here&#39;s my translation:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=5">0:05</a> - Tarzan, catch!

fake the girl flying one second next shes on the ground
Fake. The camera shaked right at the moment when the girl landed!
the kid is suspended on wires. this can hardly be called flying. yawn.
<b>L</b> Does it sound like the dogs name is Tarzan to anyone else?
It&#39;s real, people can obtain the spiritual power to fly, but those are rare cases. This may be one of the cases...
Fake Video
hes just high
Holy fuck that was the realist shit I&#39;ve ever seen in my life, reminds me of Brandon ruffell when he&#39;s eating my ass
the jackets are in different colors i think its an flying helium bollun in the start and a girl that is hiding behind something and just when the man flip the camera around the other man/woman drops the string to the ballun and the gurl comes to vision again....
how convenient the guy happens to fumble the camera when the girl is landing...i dont wanna say this is a hoax, but 1, i wouldnt walk my dog wit a camera, 2, i wouldve said something like WTF as soon as i see that, and 3. i would keep chasing them wit my camera...
if u have perfect eyes u can  see she&#39;s hanging on a little branch underneath her hood
OK , THERE ARE IDIOTS that like to make &quot;fake &quot; videos and pawn them off as &quot;real&quot;.. &#39;hey,  since we have this harness here, lets make a video making people think there was a flying girl caught on video&quot;...one, he&#39;s talking to his dog in very horrible english, he&#39;s russian, he would be speaking to his dog in ruskie, 2 the film was splced, 3 the camera pans down at the exact moment she comes down from her &quot;flight of Icarus&quot; 4, there JUST HAPPENS to be all kinds of VINES AND SHIT that would be the perfect cover for &quot;suspension&quot; wires....5 when people film, they generally are &quot;filming&quot; some sort of activity, walking in the woods with your dog is not one of them...why was he calling his dog? ..is just a bullshit video...
Why did he start filming?
the girl is like mom i want fucking down!!!!!!
Ket√§ suomest??
At the 49 second she puts her head back and you can see two pieces ,which look like part of a harness ,check it out !
12 fps makes it so credible  &lt;3
Shit not gonna go with my dog to the forest today... or any other day lel
ofc shitty camera
hoax, why would he record his dog just walking? this has to be fake
jemand wegen creepypastapunch hier?
Video debunked.......two different takes of this video¬† first take while you have¬†object¬†in the air. Second take after he looks down then back up another scene recreated to¬†replaced object with real girl running off with women
Look ma no legs
Bis jetzt finde ich das dass glaubw√ºrdigste Video was ich gesehen habe. 1. Die Qualit√§t geht noch voll klar 2. das fliegen sah unheimlich real aus 3. der ganze Ablauf mit dem Hund ist auch alles Echt. Wir haben auch einen Hund und der w√ºrde wen auch zu Leuten rennen und bellen, ich habe das Gef√ºhl das es stimmt.
I wish we could see her come down from up there. The dog barks n he moves the camera away.... There&#39;s another video n the guy enhances it n says there&#39;s someone , or more like something in the tree in the upper left when he first goes to film them.. Then in his video u can see something move past them but i dont see anything in this video so idk.. Kinda think i do in the tree but could be im seeing things
The woman&#39;s just like &quot;Really every single time we take a walk&quot;
In Soviet Russia, gravity defies you!
She was probably just trapped by the tree branches...
That babushka made her vnucka fly
ÿ≥ÿ≠ÿßÿ±Ÿá ŸÖÿπ ÿ®ŸÜÿ™Ÿáÿß ŸàÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿßÿπŸÑŸÖ
no creo que sea verdad
When I first learned to fly, my mom made sure that it was done at night so no one can see.
hey
I want to fly and im going to figure this thing out
I did that with my kid in 1980 I used 50 pound monofilament fishing line
you guys are fucking dumb even if it was a hoax real scientist can&#39;t even figure out how a person would levitate when possessed.always trying to find an explanation dumb fucks it has to do with  higher power even being intelligent there dumb ass can&#39;t figure it out.. witches have the ability so do possessed ppl its there it has been for thousands of years and you dumb asses don&#39;t believe it then fuck with the ouji board get possessed see if your ass fucking floating in mid air or walking on walls backwards it&#39;s possible dumb ass in the words or RED from the 70s show lol but it&#39;s there I don&#39;t care if you believe in religion or not it can happen to you go try see if you ain&#39;t crying saying you want out pussys
id run after them lol
The simplest way to tell hat it is a staged hoax is that when the camera pans down &quot;on accident&quot;, it pans back up right to the same horizontal position it was in previously...with NO SHAKING. That means tripod. Hoax.
WHY DIDNT YOU FOLLO THEM
Lol it&#39;s a balloon made to look like a little girl. If you pay attention by pausing frame by frame and looking closely, for one, the legs don&#39;t even look attached. The top part where the legs connect to the torso look like they&#39;re holding on there by maybe some kind of string or wire. The girl also moves in a way that a typical balloon would move, and like I&#39;ve seen somebody point out, the way her head moves is...too weird to be a human and looks detached at one point.<br>It&#39;s also way too convenient that the girl goes back to the ground as soon as the guy moves his camera away from them.<br>The real girl that&#39;s walking on the ground has a different color jacket. The one floating is completely red, the one the real girl has is more pink (and don&#39;t say it&#39;s because of the camera lol that&#39;s just grasping at straws).<br>And I don&#39;t know if it means anything, but the part where he moves his camera and it transitions to where the girl is on the ground, the quality is worse and the color is reversed, probably to make it look more authentic when he edited the video to the next part.
if its real to me  it looks as if the lady is the one making the girl levitate when she hears the dog she turns an the girl comes down
dafuq?
If you keep stopping the frame look in the background their is ghostly figures of people walking  around in the woods. 
she is the girl from ms peregines book of unusual kids or something
At the momment they are startled,that could cause him to mess up the camera shot. But, if that were a moment to swap a dummy out for a real child. Explain the puff of warm breath the little girl does while floating. There is a lot of folklore behind this incident. The coat is a stiff winter coat,but while levitating the little girls movements may be more fluidlike.The dog is clearly concerned from the beginning. He runs to them but runs back to his owner and you hear the dog make a abnormal howl. Like he is very excited. It still could be hoax,but a very good one if it is.
I believe she was from Hogwarts XD
did the camra get afeted or did she levataing girl make it go carzy and i thing the gods chouse her to be a lengend or something but it was diffently the gods
ja ich
am i the only person who thinks she is being held up by the branches. i mean gees, just use your eyes

Dafuq voll der fake <del>.</del>&quot;
Such a crappy hoax.
Maybe kid stucked in tree ?
&quot;Mom am I getting better at flying?&quot; &quot;Yes dear! OH CRAP LETS GO&quot;
I took a close look at this and have come up with a theory of how this could be and most likely was faked.  I noticed is that the girls coat when on the ground seems to be a slightly darker red.  I also noticed that the hood of the coat seemed to be floating. as did the bottom edges of the coat.  It is reasonable to believe that the floating girl&#39;s coat is not a coat at all and is made of a very light material that would float in the lightest breeze.  I also noticed that the floating girl&#39;s arm flapping and especially the head bobbing was not natural.  It reminded me of the movements of those tall windblown figures with flying streamers for hair that you often see at fairs or as advertisements.  Then it hit me.  The floating girl is a balloon!  In order to enable the balloons to float, the &quot;clothing&quot;  would have to be made of a very thin plastic that resembled cloth, such as those cheap picnic table cloths.  The bottom edge seems to be reinforced with something to stop the flopping, which resulted in an unnaturally straight bottom as the rest blows around.  The feet are rounded and not naturally shaped (no flat bottom).  A thin thread would have held the balloon in place and simply letting go of it would allow it to float out of camera range.  The question then is: Where was the little girl that took the balloons place?  She was hiding behind the logs!  If you go frame by frame at the end of the video you will catch a frame where the woman has her back to the camera and she is holding the girl.   All that is visible of the girl in this frame is her leg.  You will notice that the leg is cut off and straight across, without the foot visible.  That is because her foot is still behind the logs!
Her jacket changed colors the girl in the air and the one on the ground arent the same. If the girl in the air is actually a girl.
you can clearly her hood pick being raise by  a wire
am i dreaming?üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
Pause at :49 and¬†you can clearly see the harness up by¬†the back of her head and also¬†hanging out under the bottom of her jacket¬†holding her up, especially when you are watching it at full screen. FAKE!
why don&#39;t you stop wasting everyone&#39;s time with this nonsense and do something useful....like learning how to spell......bloody hell...
In Soviet Russia, you fly air.
the dogs name is tarzan!?!?!?
WHY DIDNT U CHASE THEM
Fake or not, that still looks really cool.
nice trick and good script!!
Are they real we don&#39;t now and we had only ????????.....<br>
It looks like she&#39;s floating on a tree
its a fake,,,,they would have heard the guy yelling for his dog way before they were seen `
anybody spot the alian at 31 seconds?
WTF SHE SHOULD OF LEFT THE OLD LADY AND FLEW AWAY
Maybe it&#39;s power of satanism
Kids can fly, as Peter Pan teaches
Fake!all Fake!
Pretty sure that this is an easy fake. Hell grab a few large balloons, some helium, and a little fishing line of sufficient tensile strength and you can replicate this at home.
you can see a breath of air escape her mouth though when she&#39;s in the air..
the sad part is that people think this is real, thanks religion...
FAKE, reasons is Why Russian man suddenly talks the convenient English with the dog, why the flying girl and Mommy not even look at the dog and man&#39;s side, Why camera not show how the girl gets down why camera moves away from the hot moment, Why the man keeps quiet when they are running, the shot looks like the girl seems was lying on a box on her tummy in a Green screen background
Pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=35">0:35</a> what is that dark figure in the background? That wasn&#39;t there before that frame
Oh for fuck&#39;s sake! Why is it that all of the supposed &quot;real footage&quot; is shaky and blurry and hard to make out! Considering we&#39;ve had camcorders for quite a while now, why can&#39;t we get 100% bonifiied proof of this kind of shit! Is ALL of it staged hoaxes or what?!
I mean it could be real but my judgement is that it&#39;s not because just the whole video looks staged and who knows how they got the little girl to look like she&#39;s flying but there is technology that can make it possible so I&#39;m saying it&#39;s fake.
It is not a helium balloon - at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=51">0:51</a> you can see her breathing, as her breath is going in the cold air... the destortion is weird however. Wish I knew how they did this trick lol
Why is it that video cameras are capable of capturing good, clear and stable, real time footage EXCEPT when it&#39;s something that is controversial or unproven?
Obviously they are all in on it. But it is creative and cute.
Fake
Fake video
omg is this real or fake ?! :0
and his dog name is tarzan
It&#39;s fake, guys. I edited the video
Omfg! Look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=33">0:33</a> u could see something whitish coming out of her mouth like right before the cameraman pins down!!üò®<br><br>Its probably the child from cervine birth
If you look at the top of her right leg, there appears to be a harness of some sort.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=27">0:27</a> looks like she&#39;s in a tree, but if that would be the case, she would directly fall down because it won&#39;t be able to handle the weight
pause video at 55 clear image off no harness
Some people take their kids out for a walk, some take them out for a fly.
Is no one seeing that weird alien like thing moving back and fourth in the background? Creepy shit
fake 100%
so how did they get the hot breath hits cold air that came out from the &quot;head&quot; area?
know whats suspicious is he moves the camera when she gos down so how dose she get down
Thx for enhancing
Super girl ..world will love and admire you ...show yourself to the great world
Something about her movements is extremely disturbing...just like the Elisa Lam video...apparently paranormal activity somehow causes these weird, almost inhuman movements...
First of all who fucking names their dog Tarzan?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=33">0:33</a>-34 something near her head moves towards her n back again, like w/branch..
HAAAACKKKKSSS
the power of putin
No fake. The girl is my brother.
it was tobi holding her up
There is a guy who did a break down of this video and studied it.  And found no wires but saw the light figure walking.  There are many things in this world that can not be explained so maybe this is one.
That dog ran up within 15ft from them before turning back. They definitely heard that dog running through snow towards them. It&#39;s only when the dog barked that they ran. It&#39;s obviously scripted. The guy could have made the dog bark with a treat.
When the Person was trying to call their dog I heard them call the dog Tarzan.
anybody else spot that shiny object on the tree in the distance and once she landed it was gone.
She have a stand and non-stand users cannot see other stands. Welcome to JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure.
hmm well it looks real but when the dog scared them away he lowered the camera and the dog doesn&#39;t run after them? so it&#39;s probably a fake but if it&#39;s real than she has the force!
oh look at the little girl balloon with bright red jacket. Than the real little girl on the ground with a different hued red jacket. :3
Redbull! :o
It&#39;s Probably the same kid who apparated in time to save that Chinese dude from getting hit by a truck.  P.S This video is real! Just like Hogwarts is. Swish and Flick! Wingardium Leviosa. ;) try it,.. works like.....
and also if you look close when the video is played back in slow motion, when the camerman pans back, the girl is still in the air then the lady catches her in her arms. if this is a fake then its such a good one and I dont see any possible explanation on how this would be faked
If you look closely you can see the little girls breath, so its not a baloon, and shes moving her head around while shes in the air
is that real?
The dog sees them and runs straight over. Why is the guy filming? Obvious set up. Also the crucial part is the landing and leaving, this is cut out. Fake but good stuff.
This is so creepy. At first I thought it was fake. I thought the girl was just a balloon dressed up as a girl, but when you slow the video down you can see her breathing out cold air...weird.
Any video that has someone SUDDENLY popping a phone up and record is suspicious to me. If he had discovered the girl levitating and picked up his phone then FINE, it COULD be real but not like this. This is fake shit!
she was caught on a tree branch and fell
she was caught on a tree branch and fell
lol conrad
you can see a guy in the background holding a pole of some sort moving around from :30 - :34.....good looking dog anyways
I love videos like this and anything to do with the paranormal or supernatural, but this video in particular is fake guys. Sorry. Look and pause at the 55-56 second marker. You can see a pulley and attached to it is a harness she is wearing under her jacket. You can even see the outline of it around her waist. And for those of you saying you see a demon or whatever, I mean really? It&#39;s her breath.
all I needed to see is the start of the video, footprints in the snow are facing the wrong way.  he&#39;s already been in the foreground before filming started.
Loric/member of garde
Ha
uuummmm... why is he recording in the first place and how dont they hear him talking to the dog? i find this slightly hard to believe....
Dis is fake
Ok, so trying to debunk this.<br>1- The girl is seen walking away. Safe to assume it is a real little girl for the last segment.<br>2- Very convenient that the camera pan down just as the girl &quot;fly down&quot;.<br>3- In the transition, frame by frame playing show that for 2-3 frame, there&#39;s encoding glitch and almost no video data is on the frame. This strongly suggest to me that the video was edited. (2 videos were joined together)<br>4- The girl in the air is not moving, except for a couple frame were it looks like it&#39;s either a recording distortion or she&#39;s bend her head back, which strangly lead to a loss of volume in the head (looks like her head deflate)<br>5- The girl in the air as a very unatural position (sort of like you&#39;d have swimming, were your boyancy pushes your body upward)<br>6- You can see a vertical like (which could be a wire) in some frame under the girl that goes to the ground<br><br>This makes me think the fying girl in a clothed Helium ballon and a real girl, from a 2nd clip, walks away.
They ran away beacause they don&#39;t want people to know she has powers? I would fly and tell it to the world! Unless they did experiments on me
So did they not hear this guy yelling for his dog over and over?
look mom looking like omg she is doing it again haha
The woods can be the abode of the jinn, a creation besides human being, it is absolutely not surprising to see and be able to understand this, but for people who think that the world has no Creator and we are from apes, even though the evidence for it is lacking, it is hard for them to understand jinn and their interaction with humans.
Pause it at 30 seconds and 56 seconds. You will see two wires.
Why didn&#39;t she just fly away?
A demon walks from write to left under the girl!
This is taken in russia. Why is the camera man speaking english to his dog?
is it me or... I see a dimensional ghost like being it the shot? In my view,  the mom is using her kid to summon some demonic entitie or something. Just like the witch trials throughout history... Or it could be a total fake. I don&#39;t see why anybody would act this random scene out tho.
She was just stuck on a tree
Shes a balloon when in the air. He looks down and pauses the recording, he resumes it when the REAL girl is there, and looks up quickly, as if she had stopped levitating.
Back of red jacket has lump , underneath is the rigging harness. Also witnessed &quot;bulge&quot; remain in shape as suspect exits also indicating it a solid/stable object, further showing its solid state concealed under the jacket also proving it a harness.
fucking sheeple will believe anything...pitiful boring lives
On all of these supernatural videos the person filming is always shaking the camera like crazy. If this were real he wouldn&#39;t just randomly start filming the ground during the EXACT second that the girl stopped &#39;flying&#39;. How hard is it to not swing the camera around like a maniac. This is either done with special effects, or they switched out the girl for a balloon while she&#39;s in the air, then when the cameraman conveniently films the ground they switched her out to a girl again.
This is totally fake, notice how the video is edited so that you don&#39;t actually see her land.
Little Red Gliding Hood
Camera unfocuses coincendently right when she desends... fake. smh<br>Also they would have heard the dog the first time.
yyyyyyyyyyyyy
there is something around the girl like a ghosthorse
If humans can fly, can flies human?
Seems legit. I flew to New York just the other day but boy my arms are tired. I will think about using a go-pro next time to prove to you doubters the next time.
Not sure about the Dogs name &quot;Tarzan&quot;
don&#39;t be fooled. this is actually a video of a small child getting tortured and killed by the sick twisted elite rulers of the world. an insider who has spoken out has described these places. it&#39;s like a small dirt ring, kind of like an ice ring but dirt. it has multi level seating around it so all the sick people can watch. he even describes how they use the dogs as part of the entertainment. notice the dog at the start.
fake
wer ist wegen jarow hier?
fake people believe anything this days
Fake
and what made you think that  the child is girl ?????
This isnt fake at all!!!!
elaborate hoax
Why the fuck would you look away with the camera when spotting something like this!?
Funny how the camera cuts away not showing her come back down, ,guess they had to disconnect the wire before she could run off
thats fake
The dog barking at the girl is a sound that has been added afterwards, to hide that he turn the camera off and then back on (while he waved it around). They had plenty of time to remove the harness. You can see that the chileds back is very fixed/tied to one place like she is attached to something rather than floating in the air.
jo
wer ist wegen Julian hier?:D
wtf
Wer ist wegen Jarow hier?
if you are russian check if there&#39;s no turkish around before flying
Omg wtf that&#39;s not reall
its fake. you can tell from the tone of the voice from the man. Its like hes acting, and the lady and girl run off like something you would see¬†chris angel or david blain doing. it does seem to look like¬†she is being held by something. It all looks staged.
mirar exactamente 0.59 el √°rbol  detr√°s  de la ni√±a nunca se ve en el video asta el precis√≥ en que esta en el suelo....fake!!!!
the harness is visible between <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=46">0:46</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=56">0:56</a>.  the harness is the same color as her jacket which is why its so hard to see.
go not ho
if you pause it and ho to :35 then their heads will be close as if the girl fell down into her arms or as if she were to pick the little one up.
Girl: Mommy, what is this?<br>Mom: Get away from that, dear.<br>Girl: Mommy, look! I&#39;m &quot;hooked&quot; ha, get it?<br>Mom: <b>(on the phone)</b><br>Crane Operator: <b>(accidentally flips switch)</b><br>Girl: Weee!<br>Mom: <b>(shock)</b><br><b>(cue rest of video)</b>
fake all videos like this are fake.
The reason for the &quot;white gap&quot; in the footage, is because the gentleman filming dropped his phone while recording.. That&#39;s what I read on Facebook, so it must be true! Lol
whaay did they run awey i mean how did a little girl fly
remember the video of the eagle swooping down to grab the baby? and turns out it was a hoax? yeaaah
Masterful editing of video. Good video trick!
:35 seconds is the white screen :b still though.. I&#39;d poop myself if I walked up on that ..
All you closeminded people who instantly say its a hoax need to get the fuck off your high horse. WE ARE NOT THE ONLY SPECIES OUT THERE!
wonder if this could be achieved though high powered magnets....
Tarzan :-D
Pause it and look at the frame at 34 secs and 35 secs.¬† It appears that the mother does catch her as she is coming down, has her in her arms, and appears to be unfastening something.
It don&#39;t look wright the dog barks and the camera blinks and the girl is now on the ground.I like to think it could happen not sure about this
whats the thing walking back and fourth? it looks like a humanoid
She&#39;s been rolling on the floor at Chernobyl I bet.
haha coll if that was real
click slowly through second 35 and you can clearly see the scaffolding in the trees.  It is a hoax, and all I did was look at it on youtube with the patience to look at each part of each second.
What about the obviously swinging line in the camera lens that only appears after the girl and woman are in the vidio, and after the camera swings away, and is out of focus; from the front and then back into focus with the girl clearly closer in distance to the women.  Also, the child is not moving the way a person with joints moves until after she &quot;lands&quot;.
There&#39;s other issues also which I don&#39;t care to go into. Like the path to the clearing.. clearly been traveled by alot of people and if you was going to hide the fact you can float. Which I wouldn&#39;t.. why choose such an open spot. And if its just woods somewhere how and why would you go there to do it. The timing are reason for even recording. The guys urge to zoom and the dog runs full speed towards them and would of gotten really close. Magically disappears and then comes running back from really close to them as well coming back to the guy from nearly the same direction from the people but out of the trees to right. Like someone was holding him cause he had already called the dog back. But nothing for a couple seconds. Dog is a huge issue sorry its a hoax
2 Biggest issues without getting into how its done is. Maybe its just me but I have a very good since of surroundings and think I would hear dog running around towards them and the guy yelling at the dog... which is pretty loud and in open woods. Second the rate of the girl falling. Float down would be to slow and to say be scared and fall. Don&#39;t think she would land on feet or be what looks to me like close to end of being sat on ground. Its impossible just for the fact she is about 2 to 3 feet to left while in air and if you look at pictures on Google images. About 8 feet off the ground center mass. There just no why she could of landed in girls arms like she did. Especially when shocked by unknown person. Good effects and camera work though.
If he didn&#39;t expect to see the little girl, why would he have filmed his dog at the beginning? like, it&#39;s kind of useless and uninteresting
I get the story the girl is full of air idk how the mans dog sees them and the man comes and sees them and when the girl screamed the air came out and they ran away from the dog TAHTS what I think
what kind of weirdo tapes himself with his dog in the woods? and has anybody heard of zach king with his computer skills? this guy couldve done the same thing except he made it look like his camera. if this is a dumb solution point it out but dont hate on it like some people did
–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ –Ω–µ—Ç
xmen escaped, where is professor X.
I know the kid
Pause at 0.31 What the Heck Happened to her head,,?
The flying girl has GAS...HELIUM TO BE EXACT...ITS A BALLOON...WATCH :31 HER HEAD BLOWS OFF FOR A FRAME...LMFAO
But how does she do that
one question; Why did they run???
notice how when the dog barked when the girl was &quot;flying&quot; the guy put down his camera and then back up again and she was back on the ground....???¬†¬† not fake at alll &lt;--------- saracasm¬† also I may have spelled some words wrong sorry about that..
Oh, how convenient that the ruski camera man cuts away to the ground for a second before showing the girl on the ground and running away. This is as fake as my boyfriends O face..
Fake she is being carried by an invisible big foot.
the saiyan race is real
You have to always think why would he be filming exactly then and how quickly from pushing record to seeing that,? It&#39;s a fake
Hmn I blame red bull and their parents
only in russia of course.
Dogs name is tarzan therefor debunked
fakr
They could get raped in the middle of the forest ! just sayin
twlight? tf i twlight doing here?
God damnit, easy on the redbull!
Esto solo es producto de personas que en la vida se sienten fracasada dentro del campo de la mediocridad, hay muchas, y se dedican a querer llamar la atenci√≥n sea como sea para sentirse falsamente exitosos, al menos por un rato,  y luego cuentan sus haza√±as de teatro barato a sus √≠ntimos  para que los elogien, y estoy seguro que lo har√°n ya que es de esperar que sus √≠ntimos sean igual de idiotas.
Joder yo habr√≠a corrido tras ellas!!! que rabia
why is she just staring at her
maybe it was the mom who has the powers, and was playing with Her daughter, a witch perhaps,
Photoshopop CS
Off world people have been on this planet since way before you were turned to a slave race... The right ones are here though now...
crazy how you can see her breathe as it cold when she floating

Flying Girl in Russian Wood? perhaps forest, not wood?  :D
Wer ist hier wegen unserer Akte die Mythen bi sich tr√§gt :DD
too shaky video to say something abaut it. But there are people who can lavetate for shure.<br>Why at0.34 is the camera so shaky????
I think it&#39;s harder to explain because if this was staged then how could they time the dog bark so perfectly? How many takes would they have had to do? they&#39;d be standing there with their thumbs up their butts waiting for a bloody dog bark. thoughts?
I see an over lap film over film ,an the background is darker than rest,with a distinct boarder between the two .besides I haven&#39;t seen any one besides Me  that can actually Fly around at will. you all have dreamstone eyes wake up
In Soviet Russia, video plays YOU!
if you pause it at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=64">1:04</a> exactly you can see the harness wires sticking out of the coat. the wires are red as well.
wtf
I wonder why it&#39;s a secret
Russian people don&#39;t fuxk around
of course this is fake!! ¬† Anyone who thinks otherwise and claims aliens and ghosts and supernatural powers are involved are clearly idiots. Out of focus branches are not strange entities. Tarzan gave the trick away, just listen to the tone of his bark and see his body language. ¬†The dog ¬†knew them. ¬†It is a set up.
the only strange thing here is to have a dog called Tarzan
Fake
does nobody see the grey smoky beings making a loop around the girl at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=43">0:43</a> seconds? you can also see a grey alien type being to the left center of the picture at¬†<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=25">0:25</a> seconds right next to the tree just observing the girl. then it¬†floats down from the trees at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=26">0:26</a>¬†seconds but you must go frame by frame because he is smoky when moving.¬† his head and giant eyes¬†pop into view at closer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=26">0:26</a>.5 seconds¬†and youll see him plain as day, eyes, mouth, arms, the whole body floats down from the trees towards the girl.
this is fake there is a rope and then when the dog barks the man took the camera away at this moment they took off the rope
My explanation of this is:<br>Russia...<br>     Now seriously:  girl is lying on some BRANCHES/ EVENTUALLY ROPE BRIDGE  (try 0,25 slow motion in settings) but we can&#39;t see this because of amazing quality. DOG BARKING IS THE SIGN for this woman and girl that the camera-man pulling this camera down than girl can get down into woman&#39;s arms. And this is enigma broken. <br>     BTW When I was a little child I have regularly dream/ or better nightmare/ like this. I ¬†dreamt that some Power trying to grab or kidnap me and even my parents were powerless and helpless in such a situation.<br><br>     I suppose I&#39;m not only one who had dreams like this and I think ¬†it represents ¬†some archetypal fear of real vulnerability, helpless, world misunderstanding and¬†unpredictability.<br><br>Off course I think it was a fake but the author caught great real insight.
More viral bullshit.
 Did you guys see when the the girl looked at the camera and her eyes were black! When they ran the must of been running back to a UFO. I paused the video at a time that looked like she was a alien and then I paused the video at a different time and it looked like ghosts were holding her up that is why she was moving so strangely!
My question is which one of them has the special gift.The girl can fly or the mom (I guess that&#39;s who she is)has some sort of telekinesis.either way pretty cool.also I don&#39;t blame them for running.i mean if I didn&#39;t want anyone to know about my powers I would keep it a secret...for as long as I could anyhow.
The reactions would be so different when it was a black guy levitating. 
are humans meant to be floppy ??
alright everyone of you that says its edited, please explain this. if she was attached to a harness wouldn&#39;t her legs be falling directly under her? and even if she is wearing a harness its clearly coming out at the top of her coat. the only way it would make her legs go out at an angle like that is if it was in the middle of her back. and the cloud that extends from her mouth? explain that as well. also, if she&#39;s attached to the tree, what human has the ability to get all the way up there to a tree that tall to hang the ropes? but, in contrast, it appears that he pointed the camera to the ground while the little girl made it to the ground. and if she is wearing a harness, clearly it would&#39;ve taken more time than the video showed to take her off the ropes/pulleys/cords. BUT the man has the power to stabilize the video so he could&#39;ve also sped up the time on the video to make it seem like it all happened within 2 seconds.<br>
Crazy shit always happens to Russians....
I feel that its fake but at the same time i dont feel its fake
But look at how the dog reacts to the girl <br><br>
Red bull hahahhahag
If you could fly then why would you RUN away??
Poor Tarzan must have been¬†traumatized !! Lol
Can we just agree its real and get over it, if shit happens it will happen in Russia and everyone knows Russia can handle a flying 8 year old girl
This is only a gain of sand compare to what is about to be release on the earth. did any one even noticed the ghost that was walking?
Maybe this lucky girl has magical powers she&#39;s showing her friend/sister, but it&#39;s a secret so when she hears the dogs bark, they know someone is close buy
***** Dont be silly. You talk like a 3 year old.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8</a>
i am not surprised .. i just had a superman movie marathon
This is why in Russia sense makes nothing
Her legs looks soo clearly comparing to the rest of stuff on video ;)
IN WHITE MAGIC you are able to do that
Why didnt he run after them<br>
This is easy. We are ultimately made out of energy. Children usually when still pure do not have doubts. You tell them that flying is possible they will fly its simple.<br><br>The reason we can&#39;t do it is because we have been programmed to doubt these things and believe them to be impossible.
She just took some weed...then she get high ...that&#39;s it<br>#420
If you look closely at 32 you can see a black rope this is fake
Could&#39;ve he chased them 
I am from Russia too I wish I could fly!
look 1 foot in front of the girls face while the dog barks. see anything ?
Freeze the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=50">0:50</a> . Just to the left of the center of the screen you can see a cable running up with a slight left hand angle to it and to the right of that you can see a second cable with vine wrapped around it in an attempt to camouflage it and it also has the identical left hand angle as the first cable.
This is totally fake
why would a russian man be communicating in english with his dog
haven&#39;t kids got better things to do these days other then floating in mid air
If you look close at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=32">0:32</a> there is a black line running from her back across her head and hood suggesting a rope??
Forget everything else, why would you be filming your dog just sitting in the woods?<br><br>FAKE - next 
Technically it would be floating if it wasn&#39;t lies.
Any video you watch could be seen in different views and have many theories. Unless you were there you&#39;ll never know the truth, and that goes for most these videos on here.. 
OH!, ¬†is this the new Petter Pan Movie..?
if you frame by¬†frame¬†the video i see zero¬†apparatus¬†wires or anything. but what i did see was a figure like shadow in the trees behind. and right before she is let down, there is a flash of light and like an entity or something. at first i laughed at this but the more I frame by frame the more I feel this may indeed be demonic
this is fake as fuck. the guy filming it gives it away with awful acting. nice try russia,  just more lies as per usual 
Everyone floats in Russia
I knew the harry potter universe was real.................illuminati confirmed
watch playlist?list=PLiRtZPv0oi3UDTjrVcfLcUBBqiK7eFjmT<br>it&#39;s still pseudo science, but i think were getting there..<br>john hutchison was able to float objects using some devices..<br>what if that devices is inside of you ready to be awakened?
So xmen are real.
Omg that&#39;s so freaky. HOW did she do that?? But why didn&#39;t the guy run after them then do some research? I&#39;d love to do that. 
Is this real? Because I want to believe it 
not saying its real or fake but what if this has nothing to do with the kids abilities and its something the mother is doing and the kid asks her to do this for fun,like tossing your kid in the air and catching them...just a thought...
How did she fly?<br>
If you pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=53">0:53</a>...its definitely not human lol. Could be a balloon i dunno. But a human doesn&#39;t bend that way.
Oh! They are auditioning for Chronicle 2: Tarzan Edition<br><br>There is nothing quite as plot thickening as a dog named Tarzan, stealing telekinesis from Mrs. Claus and her Elven side-kick!
So looks really cool but my questions are:<br>1. How did the two girls NOT HEAR the guy calling for his dog just 20 feet or so away from them?<br>2. Why didn&#39;t the guy chase them down to get an explanation or learn more? (That&#39;s what I would have done lol)
Doll in air. See the head fall of it. Then replaced with kid on ground, notice we don&#39;t see her land. Lol. Well done great photography. 
ya know the comment about the kid would&#39;ve just flying away makes sense aexcept that if this is real, she would propbably be using her mind to do so. what does this mean? it is quite possible that she just got exhausted and had to land! so stop being a jerk and let others have a moment of disbelief.
There is like a white blur ghostly thing in front of her did anyone else see????<br>
for the people wondering &quot;why didnt she just fly away&quot; to me it looked like those two people were possibly a family with natural super human abilities and they maybe go into the woods so that she could practice her flying bc she was small and maybe learning how to fly while the parent watches and teaches or they could be aliens disguised as humans still doing the same thing as what i said before OR it could all be fake :/
tarzoun
FAKE
i think that putting grated carrot in a burger is bullshit
 it was just an Internet connection lag issue
Why not chase after them and try to make contact? Anyone know the location?
TARRRRZAN
the only thing that makes me suspicious is why is he randomly filming his dog in the middle of the woods
You can tell she has a harness around her waist by the way the top of her body and legs move but the waist stays stable... easy to debunk
obviously fake! (I hope) O..o Has the guy that filmed it (with TARZAN) ever been interviewed? Where is he? Who is he? What is he? What does he hope to be??
there is no harness or cables where it gets blurry at the top of her jacket...please just look at her head and feet sections...and stay gullible...shsshhh go to sleep
Did anyone else see Sasquatch in the background?
I also noticed at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=45">0:45</a>, there is a straight line running this side of her legs. there is another one just in front of her face. they seem too straight to be something natural, like a vine. they could be cables suspended from a much bigger tree that is higher than the frame of the camera can show.
the tree that everyone is saying she is hanging from is further back than the girl; so she can&#39;t be hanging from it. stop the vid, and you can see that the tree branches are blurred(out of focus), yet the girl is in sharper focus. the girl is closer to the camera than the tree. Also, the branches of that tree are too small to support her without bending.¬†Of course she is hanging from something, but not that tree.
I&#39;ve seen harnesses, and magic tricks, but I&#39;ve never seen a person really fly. ¬†It&#39;s much more likely this is slight of hand which I know exists, not someone really flying. ¬†Also the girls position in the air suggests gravity still effects her like someone in a contraption that suspends the body in mid air would.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=45">0:45</a>+ , she moves her head to her left. she moves so far that it seems her shoulders are coming out of the jacket; like the jacket is separate from the girl.
Anyone who actually believes this then...omg...u could clearly see that she was just hanging from a tree....and then she just jumped down when they ran away
Don&#39;t waste your time wondering if this video is legit. It obviously staged.<br>Why walk away when you can fly? Next it will be a bigfoot flying with two little bigfoots...hmm maybe that should be bigfeet?
:T What cant of joke is this?!?!?!?!?<br><br>~ITS FAKE SHE IS HANGING FROM THE TREE BRACHES LOOK CARFLLY!~
Wtf.....
Shes a fucking wizard
It&#39;s not that she knows how to fly. If you watch closely something comes out of her.
It&#39;s fake. No Russian names their dog Tarzan. No Russian who didn&#39;t have something to hide that is
you can see the harness at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=52">0:52</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCAe6czp8&amp;t=54">0:54</a>
I question why he jerks the camera around, the same time she comes down. I&#39;m guessing hoax.
I wonder if it is number 4,5,6,7,8,9, or 10!<br>(reply if you get the reference)
what &quot;powers&quot; or strange abilities do you have or want to have?¬†<br>My strange abilities are ice powers and dream the future.
Lol its painfully obvious she&#39;s attached to wire&#39;s. If you cant see that, then you have no hope of achieving anything in this world.
im telling you all again.its the levitating my ASS techinic, really.i was there that morning and i made that girl to levitate.i eat beans that morning and put my ass on the ground.the girl above and levitation happened.simple
I blame redbull
FAAAAAAKE!!!!!
.
russians are the new asians. well, the country&#39;s technically within Asia.
The thing that freaks me out the most is the whole couple seconds she&#39;s up there it looks as if her neck snaps to the left HARD &amp; when it returns you see a small white gust vapor into the air then she falls in her mother&#39;s arms &amp; they run off. Wtf?! Creepy!! 
O.O
I&#39;m mad that their trying to keep it a secret! I dont care if scientists want to experiment on them I WANT THE TRUTH
People are awesome!
Cuts down on airplane tickets.
U can see a blurred guy from second 30. Maybe Rasputin&#39;s ghost holding a rope!! Nice editing, though
She could be on a tree believe it or not 
Wholly!
Wow that&#39;s weird but cool at the same time hmm are the aliens dressed up as people üòÄüòâüëΩüëΩüö∂
Screw that mutt mommy, and who&#39;s Tarzan the dog or the little girl
Ok, here&#39;s for words for thought. If this wasn&#39;t a hoax why would the little girl be in a flight position, but not moving? Wouldn&#39;t only seem reasonable that she would be standing straight up if in a hover? Wouldn&#39;t this just be general dynamics? Also, if she was really flying why does her body look to be unnaturally hovering in an almost I have to stay straight to balance fashion. Also, what made the guy have to re-adjust the camera just as the little girl was coming down? Nothing attacked him? Hit him? So, why the sudden movement away? There are too many factors showing that this is nothing more than cheaply made strings holding her up.
This is my first time ever seeing or hearing of this video, but my guess is that it is all staged. The camera man, the mother and daughter are all in on it. Perhaps even the dog. The girl is hanging on some cord that is hard to see¬† because of all of the blurred trees in the background. You can see her body rocking slighting in a see-saw motion, as if the cord is attached to her upper torso, shoulders area. It&#39;s cold, the girl is breathing out condensation, which looks almost as if some &quot;entity&quot; is holding her. When the dog barks (whether the dog really barks or the audio is dubbed during editing, we don&#39;t know) The camera man conveniently moves the camera down in order to make a quick cut, fooling the eye when the next clip is edited in. Then you see the girl (no longer attached to the harness) and the mother is holding the girl in the air, she then lowers the girl safely to the ground. No need for some quick detachment from the wire. The mother holding the girl in the air before lowering her gives the impression that the girl was &quot;floating&quot; down to her mother.¬† Then, they both run off, as if they&#39;ve been &quot;found out!&quot;¬† And of course, the man filming doesn&#39;t go chasing after them screaming &quot;What in wide, wide world of sports is going on here!?!&quot;¬†<br><br>That&#39;s just my skeptic opinion. That or its demonic.
They all float out there. And you&#39;ll float too.
Those Russian drones are pretty life-like
I believe alot of shit. .. but this here is stupid 
she is not flying she s stuck on one of the branches
Too bad there&#39;s no video of my ex-wife on her broom.
???? Wtf how can you fake thus um nit sure if it is fake ir real I don&#39;t understand this at all the girl looked at like 5 times and once the other person saw they ran like why run it doesn&#39;t make sense she could of been the most protected person in the world and the best person in the army like if it fake make a video game about her I would play that
Oh my it is fake there are clear cords one on her hat and the other two on both legs go pic by pic frame by frame and u can see them. .when she&#39;s down and da video cam is down da lady disconnects da harness, ,debunk 
Seeing a little kid floating around like a butterfly on the wind. That would defiantly stop me in my tracks. Then that&#39;s when my curiosity kick in cause I would have to know exactly how¬†this happened.
It&#39;s fake. You can see her teeter and moving her legs for balance as if suspended from something.
Only in Russia
That was so weird and scary. A russian guy with a dog called Tarzan. Freaked me out!
Holy fudge cakes. üò®
Isn&#39;t it funny that people are so quick to shoot down this video because of CGI or just wires? Why can&#39;t you have a little skeptical criticism about your criticism? This video looks legit to me, because of the fact that the of the reaction of both the camera man and the mother + daughter.<br><br>Also, the reason why the camera was cast downwards for a second was because of the dog barking. Of course you will be startled if your dog barked in quiet woods! Another thing was the dog&#39;s reaction. Hard to fake a dog&#39;s surprised eyes and stiff body like that.
Maybe Harry Potter was there and used a levitation spell on her or maybe it was all setup.......
Kids these days..
I would not want anyone knowing I could do that either. You would never know peace and probably be hunted by not so friendly people. If it is fake, no one would ever bother you except to maybe say &quot;nice trick&quot;, or &quot;that&#39;s so fake&quot;. Gotta love those humans...
Fake.
Its well done, but the give away to it&#39;s &quot;fakery&quot; is in calling the dog.<br>I do not see the common sense in the back woods of Russia to call for a dog to &quot;come here&quot;. ¬†You would just let the dog run wild. ¬†No need to call a dog repeatedly to &quot;come here&quot;.
Does any one else notice the puff of smoke or something like that right at the end before she comes down (right around her head area? You have to watch it in slow motion or frame by frame to really notice it.
They say dogs know when danger is around and they know when soething weird is going on dogs are not stupid. see if this is fake and a person is holding her he probably thinks that something&#39;s going on with a camera and everything. But if that&#39;s real he know&#39;s that&#39;s not normal
..watching this again... I think it&#39;s Tabitha and Samantha from Bewitched!!
Dog seems trained for this... why would he take his video walking- seems like a set up.... maybe so...maybe not... but my intuition is thinking: set-up.. I wish people wouldn&#39;t create fake things and try to pull them off as real. It really messes everything up when there really is an interesting event or experience that is authentic...but we are living among type 1 sociopaths... and they just love to play and fool people..¬† I wonder why the woman doesn&#39;t seemed concerned with the child in the air... and the child seems stiff like attached to something... and his reaction after doesn&#39;t seem authentic...¬† and it seems like the dog ended up coming back to him and then barking... hmmmm....
what would you do for a klondike bar?
