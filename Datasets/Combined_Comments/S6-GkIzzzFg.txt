The whale is so smart she knew exactly how long he could last under water. That’s what astonishes and amazes me. Perhaps from all the years of training but she knew. She knew. I truly believe if he was down there for another 5-10 seconds he wouldn’t have come back up conscious.
If you look at 18 seconds he jumps over the orca making contact I think this is what made the orca teach him a lesson because the truth is the orca could have destroyed this guy in seconds.
I went there in the early 90s, being face to face with an orca at the big glass window as a 4 year old.<br><br>Will never forget it. But it took me a while to realise the abuse these animals endured.
Dont blame mammals for being stuck in a gold fish bowl for going crazy we would be the same
They stole some orca pups from their mothers. They were born free in the ocean and separated from their groups. They spent their lives penned up in pools and made to perform stupid pet tricks several times a day. Death was their only escape.
Seaworld should be shut down!
Damn he won onlympic gold the way he swum out of that pool
... GBU, so is he still a trainer today or he quit back then?
Orca should have grabbed everone else aswell ... that was  the orcas only way of saying listen get me the f out of this tank enough is enough!!!
So extraordinary STUPID to play with these animals.
that guy has a nice head shape nice and round
The man survived because the whale decided he will survive. No other reason. Despite being imprisoned, they show more empathy than the humans involved in their imprisonment. Shame on anyone who still supports these places.
When you’re knocking on Gods door
orcas are smart never trust them.
I agree that these animals shouldn’t be in captivity but god damn it people you don’t understand. THEY CANT JUST BE THROWN BACK INTO THE WILD!!!! They’ve literally tried and he died. His name was Keiko and he literally avoided other whales because he preferred human contact. They can’t just put them back.
Oh my God, could not breath just by watching this, when he jumps that net and sees that whale getting close, wow he was in panic running away, crawling, God gave him the luck and wisdom to get away from that tragic so scary moment
американец
It dosent look as aggressive as tilikon she seems nerved
Rendez la liberté à ces animaux marins... Pour eux un bassin si grand soit il est une prison.....
Sorry for the man but... Seaworld is a jail for wild animals. They knows that this is explatation animal.
Supongo que despues de esto el man se retiro.
Thank god he was able to hold his breath for such an incredible amount of time. Saved his own life. These animals need to be kept strictly in the wild they have multiple oceans to swim through for a reason.
She dominated him. They are EXTREMELY intelligent creatures. They should be left in the wild or a sanctuary where they can have liberty and not forced to perform like a circus
the way he ran back to the shore, I almost died laughing
People just don’t get it “wild animals”
I never liked those places, never brought my kid to those shows, I have no respect to trainers, who know they train captured mammals who don’t want to be there. Leave animals alone and put them back into wild waters!!!! They don’t love you, stop showing this “ compassion and love “ to us!!!! They love their own families in the sea, but not you!!!!!!!
I feel sorry for the orca!
This people are involve in the animals cruelty!
People saying he reacted so calmly....he was totally out of breath and couldnt even panic any more! He tried to catch his breath. He couldnt panic after the orca took him up. The orca could have easily take him back under or stay under longer. You are just a toy in the end. You can never ever think you have total control over wold animals. No no no...they are in charge in the end and when needed they will definitely let you know. Ah well he lived to tell and went on training with them I understood...
Sing it drowned
I bet you he never did that again 😊
😂😂😂😂
When are people going to learn wild animals shouldn’t be kept in a prison and made to perform. It’s a wonder more people haven’t been killed because of sea world. It’s sick they’re still in operation 🤮🤮😢😢
I don&#39;t feel sorry for these trainers at all
set these animals free,they r nothing to be played with
Free these beautiful orcas NOW!
She could of killed him if she wanted to, she just showed them who’s the boss even tho she the one who is in that cage.<br>those creatures way more forgiving <br>then they should be.
And yet Orcas are still used for the pleasure of us humans, shameful 😢
You see what happens, Larry?
More karma for these disgusting people please
Nice to see these guys get what is coming to them
THE CREW WAIT HIM TO DIE🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That is what happens when we cage wild animals
Karma
Well why are we keeping these animals in captivity in the first place???
His fear was palpable!
That guy was amazing. His calm demeanor and smart thinking kept him alive. This should have told everyone involved humans have no place in some “pool” with orcas.
The problem is the sheep who paying for this kind of mistreatment of wild animals ... as long as idiots are paying the &quot;show&quot; abuse will continue
Just stop .
Nur leicht verletzt, steh auf😅😅
Warum liegt er jetzt
I wonder if the trainner went back to work again.
Nasceu de novo, bossal
Jehová Dios creó todo bello y perfecto, pero el ser humano siempre quiere tomar decisiones sin la Sabiduría de Dios. Las orcas no son malas ni asesinas. Solo un tonto egoísta y avaro que hace las cosas por obtener dinero pensaría que las orcas son malas o asesinas. Las orcas son una bella parte de la creación de Jehová Dios y Jehová les dio como hábitat el océano. Nadie tiene el derecho de matar a los padres de las orcas y secuestrar los hijos para llevarlos cautivos a pequeños estanques de agua o piscinas. Ellos fueron creados para vivir en libertad en el océano, y Jehová Dios les dio todo instinto necesario para vivir en el océano, y vivir sanos y felices. Estas tristes historias de ataques de orcas a entrenadores es una lección del Dios Viviente, del Dios de los Cielos, de nuestro Creador. Nadie puede ir en contra de las leyes de Jehová Dios. Él quiere que toda su creación viva alegre, sana, y feliz incluyendo a todos, animales, seres humanos, y plantas. Para los que han asesinado orcas y secuestrado a sus hijos, les pregunto: Les gustaria ser asesinados y que cojieran a sus hijos y los encerraran en el zoológico para servir de asmereir a los demás por dinero? Piensen egoístas y asesinos. Un animal tiene sentimientos, y también ama a sus hijos. Muchos animales son mejores que los propios seres humanos, y esto da vergüenza. Los animales son importantes y merecen ser amados y respetados, y esta es la Bendita y Santa Voluntad de Jehová Dios, Creador, Rey, y Señor del universo entero. ¡Nuestro Bendito Salvador! ¡Amen! Hallelujah!
First of all whales don&#39;t belong in a damn water tank to entertain people...They belong in their natural habitat...In the ocean with othet whales<br><br>Not even one of his co-workers  try to help him...or even get a long stick he could grab on to so they could pull him out...If you play with fire you&#39;re gonna get
صراحةانا اشوف هم الغلطانين
Para la ballena es solo una foca el cual cuando apetece se lo comerá 🤷🤷🤷🤷el ser humano cree q puede tener poder sobre la naturaleza etc y ya se ve q no
Good 😂
He only has himself to blame
He made the choice to be there. Unfortunately the Orca did not 💔
La pregunta es, xq no se lanzó al agua la compañera para ayudarlo.
Let the Orca s free!!
When you are up against a 7000lbs machine monster you have nothing against it ! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23settheorcasfree">#settheorcasfree</a>!!
La perenne smania dell&#39;uomo di dominare ogni creatura. Lasciate gli animali liberi di vivere la loro vita fuori da gabbie e acquari.
Come on folks... She needs HER OWN air, not 8nthe surface for this poor whale...
Sometimes white people can be overly nosey
FAFO..😮
FREE WILLY  🐳 <br>RIP Michael Jackson ♥️ 🎶
His foot didn&#39;t  have any seriously  bite marks on him. Did his rubber shoes get snagged  on the whale sharp teeth by any chance,  causing  him to get dragged  under water for a little  while? Just curious.  If the whale  wanted to do serious  damage I  am pretty  sure it would have bit him harder.  Just sad this incident  happened.  They can&#39;t  get mad at whale.
Is there a documentary of him talking about what was going through his mind ECT ECT ? I would LOVE to watch and listen to his side
I appreciate good step taken by whale.. She was just giving him a lesson of his life.. These animal trainers get trained by animals.. Never interrupt in their life, Never Abuse animal for greed. This whale was suffering unlike others who were kept in captivity..she just want to show this human,the pain of not being in her natural surroundings..Every animals want to be free and live in their natural environment and every human being wants air to breath...
An orca in the wild wouldn&#39;t do that...
Very good game
Orcas are Not Toys!!!!
Gracias a Dios se salvo
In my opinion Whales and Dolphins should be in the Ocean.
Whales and dolphins shouldn&#39;t be in captivity. Killer whales are just large dolphins. They&#39;re too intelligent to be stuck in a cage and forced to &#39;perform&#39;.
Did this man ever get back in the water with the whales after this happened?
-Think that what would you do if they put you in jail to have fun,<br>-Then know that he was too polite…
I always root for the whale - GET &#39;EM!!!
😂😂😂 loser trainer finely got his prize ... karma
Dios mio, que locura
Nice
This give me goosebumps.
I thought Sea world wanted the Orcas to show attention and playfulness……not to line their pockets but to educate the paying guests, the little kids and parents about wild animals…no? 🧐
That’s exactly what I would do as an orca. Being used as a clown.
pleased to see. Free Willy!!!
hehehehe
Why didn&#39;t the other trainers offer the whale a fish? It would have released him instantly
Orche libere. Blackfisch. L istruttore portato sotto il fondo, per soffocarlo. Un orca chiusa è sfruttata soffoca, come ogni essere vivente
Poor creature. ☹️
Hasn&#39;t there been ENOUGH caught on tape already. Idiots! That&#39;s all I have to say, complete idiots...
This shows must be forbidden... the animals belong to the wild.. and there they need to live.
SET THE ORCAS FREE!!!!!!
Let them go back to their world...
Good grief. Everybody keeps commenting that they give credit to the trainer. Well, there is nobody else. Noone went to help him.. poor thing. Now you know your colleagues. This is not the case of Henry Bource... even his girlfriend jumped into the water and that was a SHARK attack. They were all professional divers... these seem amateurs. That guy though... he is LUCKY the whale had mercy on him, xx..
We all know they belong to the sea.
Tierschänder stehen vor Gott wie menschenschänder! Wer Gottes Leben schändet hat kein Recht auf Leben und kann nie wieder geboren werden
Esse daí posso falar que nasceu de novo quando fôlego debaixo da água.<br>Fiquei admirando como ele soube acalmar o bicho pra ele pôde escapar foi por um tris.<br>Mesmo a treinadora vendo aquilo que foi corajosa continua com a criatura dela foi pior.
Que loucura dos seres humanos
This is why NO dolphin whale or marine animals should be in captivity.!!!!!!!.
The stupidity never ceases to amaze me 😂
Орка просто показал кто хозяин положения, даже в неволе🙏🙏🙏
That’s why you don’t keep wild animals in captivity
Whales are Not dogs leave them in the ocean
They are done beeing drugged to entertain ppl 😊 i so love them , grateful nobody died tho
Killer whales could end a human in a hot second.<br>Theory 1: this trainer mistreated the whale(s) behind closed doors and this orca was teaching him a very gentle lesson.<br><br>Theory 2: the prisoner..I mean orca wants to be free and is <b>very gently</b> performing a hostage situation. What else can she do.💔<br><br>Oh and, human&quot;kind&quot; disgusts me.
Very foolish to be in the water with that or any killer whale  😂 , do it again 😂
Ich habe kein Mitleid mit dem Menschen aber für den Orca.
No one tried to help at all!!!!!!!!
I hope next time the whale finishes the job.
Poor you.😂
We are so arrogant as a species that we think we can keep a 12500lb whale in a swimming pool and not expect something like this to happen, The whale was absolutely right to behave like this and any animal would under the same circumstances. To be fair the reaction of the whale was rather understated and controlled considering it’s circumstances.
These people get what they deserve. Keeping an apex predator in a tank and making it perform tricks for money is disgusting. Mess with the bull and you get the horns.
Maybe we need to ask the Orca his version of the story too. Humans can be the most vile, manipulative scoundrels.<br><br>Nevertheless, kudos to the Trainer for coming back alive.
It’s sickening if I was deprived of my huge open ocean I would be mad with you too let me go let me be free! Literally these wales need to go and be free no more wales captured for prop and for money
Deserved everything that happened and more. Shouldn&#39;t work for a scummy company like SeaWorld.
The whale was telling him that humans are the most pathetic creatures on the planet.
I bet you the trainers won&#39;t get back in that water 💧 but it sucks for the new trainer guys who doesn&#39;t know this story 🤭🤨
🙄
Maybe you shouldn’t keep orcas in captivity…. It’s not where they belong
I&#39;m glad this had a happy ending. Playing with wild predators doesn&#39;t always turn out well.
KILLER whale... it&#39;s all in a name
Luckily he didn’t panic and was a diver or something so knew how to control his breathing
Don’t keep them in a zoo then
played like a toy ....no fault of the whale ...glad it ended well
This man survived an attack from the deadliest orca in history. That&#39;s like walking into the cage of a lion who hasn&#39;t eaten in 3 days and walking out with only a few claw marks.
İt belongs in the ocean, not a swimming pool, entertaining people.
Whale steak.
They just don&#39;t belong in cages. the have the entire ocean in the wild, and they&#39;re living in a bathtub. It&#39;s horrible. A lifetime prison sentence for being beautiful and intriguing. So horrible.
Poor animal
Jesus Christ 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Anyone else notice the possibility at 17 seconds when he dives in that he may have bumped into the Orca? With his hands or knee or hip maybe or even feet, it doesnt look like he clears it at least fully or slides off of it smoothly, perhaps his misjudgement and accidental bumping of it may have provoked it into retailiating? <br><br>Even if it wasnt too painful of a bump for an orca, a knee from a fully grown man you&#39;d think could be enough to possibly provoke some kind of reaction? A reaction it then went on to have, not killing him, but by retaliating in what it may have percieved to be proportional and equal in measure, or in a rage loses its self only to regain and let him go once the pain or anger subsides.
where did she go after jumping over the divider?
If that had been me and probably many other people, I would have died. She took him down to the bottom for quite a while. I don&#39;t know if I could&#39;ve held my breath that long, especially under extreme stress, pressure, and panic. Kudos to that man 👏 Very well done.
😂
so what they are no pets to be put in a pool fools.
There’s no reason to training a whale 👎🏼🤬
Whale: always know I have the upper hand.
Whale in jail ?
Саечку за испуг
How much money did this dude get in the lawsuit?
Free the orcas
Me congratula
Always crazy whites
But why is there no audio? :(
Chéh!
CBS doesn’t understand what an orca is. ITS NOT A WHALE
I rly don&#39;t care 8 billions of us, who cares... This is his JOB. He take money for risks.
The way she came after him even when he was getting away is terrifying
Freeee!!!!!!
I wish people would stop treating wild animals like this. Play silly games, win silly prizes
That’s what he get for putting a whale in jail😂
No more trust to this fish again.
Maybe stop having animals for entertainment purposes in captivity. Stupid hooomans
Go Orca bad humans !!
it&#39;s not a whale it&#39;s a dolphin
Poor animals trapped on a pool
Come on! How do you expect a very smart wild animal being captive acting? Just releasing his emotions from captivity. The title could have been: &quot;A Whale trying to defend himself&quot;.<br>Im sorry for what happent to the trainer but we should all boycott this kind of circus and the trainer aswell.
Rien compris
He probably has been looking for a different kind of job after this event.
Why would try to tame an animal with the word killer in its name.
Good Orca❤❤❤
This is why you don’t captivate wild animals for your own entertainment🤷‍♀️
Orca should not be in captivity <br>They are not dogs <br>They are sentient intelligent and recognise that humans have put them in a bathtub and are the source of their torment<br>This is another example of evil wicked ppl and their greed and exploitation of wild animals for profit<br><br>Boycott ALL such concentration camps for animals
Hooray for the whale!!!  Pity he/she couldn&#39;t walk out of there...
They should never keep the wild in cages and then try to play. That isn&#39;t there home and no one wants to be locked up.
Quello che succede quando metti in prigione un essere più senziente degli spettatori.
It’s a shame he didn’t drown him tbh
a small reminder .....
Truly deserved that
i know about this video. it just shows you how much wildlife hates americans
How much money do you think this guy got from Seaworld?
He didnt get what he deserved.  Ill never support this type of show.
They are called killer whales for a reason!
I could be wrong, but I think I read that the trainer died later because of inner bleeding.
So you want to play huh?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You all deserve it for keeping them locked up in my opinion. Find another profession already. They are not actors. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23earthsucks">#earthsucks</a>
Well deserved❤
I heard the Killer Whales are super drugged with Meth like drugs from some Sea World guy on Joe Rogan I think.
Yea of couse.  Why play. Why make moneys. This games.    Dont touch animals.
OMG! He kept em under water for 65 seconds
Why isnt he yelling for help all that time!?
The Orca was just letting him know who’s really in charge…
Whale…and for my next stunt I will test this little man’s ability to hold his breath and when he taps out I’ll bring him back up
keep on being funny with wild animals!!! good, good
Is that all? I believe SeaWorld itself drowns.
usa home of the special ed
You can see on that women’s face things were getting ugly
the fact the orca brought him back to the surface for air shows it knew he needs it to survive this might have been playing gone horribly wrong, i mean the orca coulda just never brought him up and if it wanted him dead hed be dead. whales are play partners for a reason lol wild
I thought the whale was his friend?
Sickening trying to demonize the orca while humans are the true terrorist
Good for the whale!!! You guys colonize and enslave them for your own personal gain. That whale should have ended that guy!! God is not happy with enslaving his creation
A large marine mammal that only has a pool to swim in when it&#39;s used to the ocean, pumped with drugs to keep it docile, separated from its family, forced to play tricks for another species&#39; entertainment. Gee, I wonder what could go wrong.<br>You&#39;d eventually be at the end of your rope too if someone did that too you.
I am glad he survived.Please release all the whales that kept like a prison in those pulls.
I love it !
I hope he learned quickly. Don&#39;t play with these animals.
Guess who putting in they two weeks
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. It&#39;s disgusting keeping these animals in captivity. The people who pay to watch the shows are just as disgusting
Wow. Great job not panicking. That saved his life
And that&#39;s why you don&#39;t f**k around with animals that should be left in the wild
Lucky he was just playing with homie!!! 🐋 long live this beautiful WILD animal,
Why play around with something that is as well called a killer whale ? 😂yeah no !
i love it when animals attack lol these people treat these wild animals like a performing dog well there just that much more powerful lol.
Poor orca was frustrated and tired. Their place is in the wild Nature . Theyvare also mistreated to make act lot of times
Whales belong in the ocean. Very sorry for that trainer.
How stupid the whale was just playing. The man&#39;s lucky to be alive. Not enough humility in front of this creature!
Lunacy. Humans don&#39;t respect natural limitations. When wildlife does what&#39;s natural, everyone is shocked. Stop trying to tame what cannot understand how to be tame on cue. Not the whale&#39;s fault, but glad the trainer survived. Wow.
As an American, he was probably more worried about his medical bill.
is tilikum same as shamau?
ANIMALS ARE NOT ENTERTAINMENT. HE DESERVED ALL OF IT AND MORE. AQUARIUMS AND SEA WORLD ARE PRISONS
WPS.
I mean. It&#39;s a KILLER whale so... 💁🏾‍♀️
A lifetime of abuse, and confinement caused this.
well deserved, just leave wild animals alone! it is still wild and can attack anytime!
Did seaworld learn? Nope, they continue to sell Orcas to other places around the world.
I laughed out loud when he started running away and slipped on the side of the pool as the Orca was just looking back in his direction. I hope he remembers that moment of being absolutely scared shitless for the rest of his life.
This was amazing. I love it
Probably the whale was tired of there 💩
That&#39;s what they get
These animals are basically tortured for decades and most people are just fine with that but when one animal is threatening a human it will be talked about as a sensation for decades.
That poor whale taken from its family. How can be so disgusting. You get what you deserve
why dfq did no one help him?? 😭✋
Who
This what happens when u think u can play and make fun of a animal quite more intelligent than most of people. This gay is not alive because lf him , he was forgiven
Set it free .You shouldn&#39;t be torturing it for human entertainment. It&#39;s cruel and inhumane .It&#39;s time to ban people being allowed to do what they like to animals .let them live their own lives .we all know by now these animals love in family groups. As do most other spieces on the planet .we are not superior .
🧠🧐
She just wanted to play.  Sucks when there’s a 2000 lbs difference between the both of you.
If my parrot bites me i never blame him , I reflect on my interaction with him and work out what I did wrong . I realise that he is not a domesticated animal such as a cat or dog and has totally differant reactions to my actions .
The trainer looks like he is trying not to pass out while he was holding onto the orca at the end. So terrifying😩
Better luck next time!<br>Loser almost got what he deserved!
Omg dude had to be terrified out of his wits!
They imprisoned the animal
Maybe we should stop imprisoning and exploiting wild animals. Just a thought.
😂😂😂😂
Did you notice that the whale was headed straight back for him as he swam for his life?
States need to make it illegal to contain killer whales
Good job killer whale ..good job.. make humans the toy at least one time.. you have been the toy for humans all your life.. and I am so sorry for your captivity ..
Its weird watching someone live your worst nightmare
I just watched Black Fish.. I dont blame trainers, they were naive back then and all loved those animals, but I dont blame orcas either, I would do the same if I was one, very patient kind animals..
No sympathy. He chose to be part of a system that abused intelligent animals.
That’s what u get for petting wild animals.leave animals alone
Can&#39;t blame the orca can you.
Glad she tried to drown an idiot who make her perform tricks everyday. These sea world trainers are lowest of humans
This animals deserve to be free
Why didn&#39;t someone jump n to help SMH
Thought he was a super hero but proper s**t himself and ran like Usain Bolt to get out of the pool. 😂
He was so lucky that he still alive..
Get the point already, leave them alone they serve a bigger purpose then for our greedy intertainment
Uma dica: não trabalhe torturando animais nem sendo capataz de torturadores de animais, não trabalhe sendo animador de psicopatas que curtem e pagam para assistir a animais sendo torturados e chamam isso de show. Assim, você não corre o risco que esse homem correu.
just playing
It&#39;s just plain too dangerous to think that everything is safe because they appear to be trained
Dont take orcas in captivity
I would’ve put my 2 weeks in from the pool
Look at me:<br><br>This is my foot now
This breaks my heart  it shouldn’t be allowed 😢
Humans always out to tame wild animals, white people on a larger scale than anyone. Who can blame that whale?
Orcas teach each other. they might not know our languages or how the human world works on land but they still teach in their own ways, it was showing the diver and the audience something...It knew exactly what it was doing.
Neither the trainer nor the orca are to be blamed. Though some animals are very happy to live 24h with humans (dogs, cats…), most just want their freedom in the wild and they deserve it. Just like we want our freedom.
Honestly one of the most stressful videos I&#39;ve ever watched. Adrenaline surge for him to survive and I&#39;m very glad he did.
These people will never understand that as long as you put a 10,000 pound wild animal in a bathtub, things can go wrong very quickly
My heart breaks seeing this...<br>😢 such a majestic creature locked up for his entire life only for our entertainment....
You play with fire you get burn 🔥
I like how the spotters just literally stood there doing nothing. Just disgusting
They shouldn&#39;t be in captivity unless they are being nursed back to health and then released immediately after. <br><br>However, the engineer mindset in me makes me think of ideas. Bare with me for those who are not interested in this kind of engineering problem.<br>They could have easily(but expensively) had installed a water pump deluge system that was the same used on the launch pad for the space shuttle. Those pumps pump about 500,000 gallons of water per minute and the main Orca tank in san diego holds about 900,000 gallons of water. The tank would be completely emptied in 5.4 minutes. The diver would need to hold their breath for probably at most 4 minutes where they would be able to breath from the water being so low. <br><br>It probably wouldn&#39;t come to needing to completely emptying though because there would be such an immense noise and quick lowering of water that the orca would most likely release the trainer immediately with no harm done to the orcas or trainer. If worse came to worse (completely empty) the orcas would be gently lowered to the bottom and immediately after the trainer is in a safe position they would fill it back up just as extremely quickly as it was emptied. <br><br>Now you would need a huge equal reservoir to put all that water, so you might as well do away with the pumps and have flood gates that would be able to release the water at a faster rate with gravity and displacement. With proper distribution and number of these flood gates/channels you could eliminate any harmful currents that would harm the orca or trainer. You would need at least one or two of those huge pumps to pump the water back in though quickly to return the orcas to their normal buoyancy/ weight distribution.<br><br>This is not a realistic situation at all since seaworld would not spend the money on safety of this nature for the trainers, so it&#39;s more just combining my love for orcas and engineering into one fun problem to solve. Would probably honestly be horrendously cheaper to have some kind of underwater vehicle for reconnaissance to go and coerce the orca to release. <br><br>Actually, now that I think about it, here is another option that is far more feasible. You have a lattice panel structure the size of the pool that resides on the floor at all times. Then all you do is pump tons of air (compressed air for speed) into air cavities in the lattice panel structure and the whole thing rises to the top. Air in any kind of inflatables have been proven to be able to lift ENORMOUS amounts of weight, including the weight of an orca. Problem solved. Emergency evac and the whole thing rises to the top and trainers can walk over to the trainer to help them get to safety and then release the air and Kasatka will be lowered back into the water.<br><br>Thanks for humoring me, lol. This was a fun problem. But again, orcas shouldn&#39;t be in captivity to begin with but this is just an interesting engineering problem to solve to maintain complete safety of the orcas and trainers.
whale are no Brain
His calmness didn’t save him. Luck did.
God bless you
Sad.
Ich werde euch anzeigen. Die Ingrid ist informiert. Was soll die scheiße!? Ich hoffe der Orca rächt sich an euch. Denn genau das habt ihr verdient!!!
Sea world kills!
Jamais je n&#39;ira voir un spectacle d orques...les tenir enfermées est d une violence extrême !!! Qu est ce que les gens font pas pour du pognon 🤬et je ne parle même pas des spectateurs 😡🤬
How exciting!
I hope the whale is alright
Duhhhhhh..................................
Why are the others just looking for heaven sake jump in the water and save her !!
This beautiful animalds should live in freedom, not in a circus tank. So, let them fight against their punisher
Silly young people who were coerced  by greedy owners they could control a wild animal. Even leading to the death of trainers and whales. How sad is that?
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
I understand wild animals are unpredictable, but I do wonder why they turn on their trainers like this unexpectedly 🤔 what triggers it? I guess it&#39;s like when we are not having a good day mentally or emotionally 😕
F@$k Seaworld, my husband wants to take my son there, never!
&quot;Aight. Who&#39;s going in next. We got a show happening today.&quot;
BASTA DE IR A VER ESTOS ESPECTÁCULOS ILEGALES POR QUE LOS TIENEN COMO SUYOS Y LOS ESCLAVISAN ,LOS SACAN DE SU HABITAD ES CRIMINAL ESTO
.....play with Wild animals,  cage them for fun.....&amp; our entertainment......she was probably playing....didnt even realize...if she wanted him dead he would have been! Humans can be so stupid
Poor animals..... 😢
Innocent in prison
Drown him. Get him next time
Orcas are super intelligent beings. Think they don&#39;t realize they&#39;re being kept prisoners and these are their jailers? Why would anyone think it&#39;s OK to lock a highly intelligent animal in a pool when this animal is wired to travel freely THOUSANDS of miles in every ocean?
Not gonna lie. If I was held captive in a big cement bathtub that was nothing like my natural habitat and my only activity involved doing tricks while trainers did that annoying hand clap and cheerleader smile, I’d be eating humans too. Just sayin’
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6-GkIzzzFg&amp;t=194">3:14</a> the diver realy thought he was dead. I mean, look how scary this turn is
I woulda been like shoot this muthaf*<b>*</b> lol
Good
Blank Space plaYs: wanna! Play!
Take that SeaWorld trainer!
Applause 🙌 to Wale<br>Just let me go from here
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6-GkIzzzFg&amp;t=200">3:20</a> when the orca turned around and started coming for him again 😮
Касатки умные, хищные животные. И если их ограничивать в их природных инстинктах то они становятся агресивными. И всë заканчивается печально. <br>Этот ролик вам ни что не напоминает? Да. Это обратная сторона &quot; луны &quot; то есть как люди так и касатки😥.
Dont go to seaworld!!!!
😢😢😢😢
You can see him fighting not to pass out when he finally gets back up
The whales were meant to be free not to do these cheap tricks . You reap what you sow
SAD😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪
Trying to tame a 5 ton intelligent yet aggressive creature in its natural environment. What could possibly go wrong?
Anybody that would swim with them, obviously isnt very smart!
He wasn&#39;t being cleaver at all. He was scared. His fault for trying to boss him around.
Clearly the whale had enough and had it in for him.
FREE ALL ORCAS, if you want to see them rent a boat and go out in the ocean where they live, stop bringing them inland to put them in tanks for your selfish pockets! Period
No tienen ninguna seguridad, ni los compañeros hacen nada por salvarlo, como acercarse y llevarlo lejos o tirarle una cuerda, es increíble.Se salvo porqué mantuvo la calma y la orca lo perdonó.
I got no sympathy with the man. Why trouble the animal leave them<br>Alone
Leave animals alone at peace
Lol don’t disturb mess with animals leave them alone
Who does this animal abuser think he is, just jumping into the tank of a killer whale. his own fault, serves him right
The Humans are Basterds .
Am I the only one who noticed that he dove on top of the whale when he dove in?  There wasn’t any clearance like there usually is.
Do not take the freedom from them and this will not happen
White people love caging animals. Let them go!!! They have feeling too. 😢
A ver si dejan en paz los animales
6-8 meters under water without equalization air, and BAM you feel a lot of pain in your ears. looks like it happen to him you feel dizzy and lots of pain if you pass 8 and you start bleeding out of your ear
I definitely would&#39;ve been dead I can&#39;t hold my breath that long and I would&#39;ve panicked way sooner.
I feel bad for both but I blame SeaWorld as an abusive corporation. The whale was forced into an enclosure too small and was treated horribly and the trainer was put in horrible danger. The deaths and injuries aren’t enough to shut down SeaWorld?! Proof, so much evidence and nothing is done?! Such an injustice to WILD animals and such disregard for human life all for the sake of trying to make entertainment! Disgusting
Good
They need to release them
Surprised he didn’t drown the whale with the weight of his massive balls!
Did they not have something to scare the whale? Like some concussion Grenades
She was trying to make him do tricks as well
They don&#39;t tell you the other part to this, but you can look it up. Kasatka attacked as a result of punishment because she wasn&#39;t training the way they wanted. She was only interested in momming her new baby, and so they decided to separate her and her baby. During this performance she heard her baby crying out from a back pool, so she attacked out of frustration. They shipped her baby away after this.
Nature can not be contained
I just don&#39;t understand why they didn&#39;t have some kind of gate underneath the bottom that can pull them up for emergencies hello wake up
God bless the Orca.
Definitely worth the price of admission.
First of all they are wild creatures they are not our pet&#39;s 😂
That must have been absolutely horrifying. Good on him for knowing what to do in that situation. I can&#39;t even imagine!
Learned your lesson? Orcas should not be in captivity to perform and entertain humans!
He did amazing job, even when he was in risk he tried to have calm close ro the Orca, but why no one helped him. Why they didn’t tried to get the Orca attention with food  !!!! Respect for them trainer. 🫡
SeaWorld lied about the problems they were having with killer whales, like Shamu.  It&#39;s all about the money.  I will never go to SeaWorld again.
Que desesperación inicio qué tenías que salir rápido de esa profesión. El instinto animal es algo de no jugar
Qué pánico interior debió sufrir.<br>Pobre Orca a la que le robaron la libertad y a su cría.<br>NO AL MALTRATO ANIMAL
Hahahaha <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6-GkIzzzFg&amp;t=157">2:37</a> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
But it brought him back up to the surface that’s strange
What&#39;s this man&#39;s name
The reaction of &quot; the medicatie team &quot;: this man needed oxygen!!and a infuse. <br>All attention to his foot !<br>This is for later.<br>Thank G he survided !
When will you learn????stop torturing animals for fun!!!!
Hi deserve that,have the animals feel I hope that the orca is all right!
the trainers are not to be killed  by orcasthey are children of god
orcas are danger abd cruel
Is that Dawn? Standing outside the water ?
Can you imagine being captured by a flock of tuna fish and held hostage in their air tight baloon, getting trained by them to perform stunts for their entertainment, knowing all along that you have a family up on the land. The fish would feed you little bites of banana and apples and would learn to trust you, and you wouldn&#39;t hurt them because you knew if you do you will die of hunger. You would let them pet you, tease you and do weird stuff to you. Until.. one day on your birthday, a distant memory flows into your mind and you get a taste of how delicious barbecue tuna tasted when you were a kid and your mom and dad took you out to dinner at Fish &amp; Grill hut... Mmmm and you could not help it but get that tuna that forgot to give you your reward for your extra special trick. I guess that&#39;s how it is for orcas in captivity 😢
Too bad he survived
This video makes swimming with orcas seem so fun.
Killer whales😂😮😅
😢sad
It would have taken me 5 seconds and I would be looking at my dead body from the afterlife.<br>That was scary stuff. I&#39;m glad he didn&#39;t die.
Its insane
Wheres tha sound?
How odd!!!  WILD KILLER WHALES being made to do stupid tricks while being held captive in small tanks while harassed by stupid humans and they become WILD KILLER WHALES?!  How odd hey don&#39;t like it.
whale knew what it was doing
Orca should have killed him.
FREE THOSE ANIMALS.  TAKE THEM HOME
This trainer was actually mistreating the female killer whale that attacked him  behind the scenes according another trainer he would lock her up in a tiny medical pool overnight  separated her calf when she didn’t behave or she couldn’t get a hang of a certain trick .
He won’t do that again 😂
Glad he survived. Simple solution don&#39;t keep wold animals in captivity
They are just mamals..
You would think a tank?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6-GkIzzzFg&amp;t=48">0:48</a> <br>Human: <b>I know what’s happening next…</b>
Diese Tiere dürfen nur in Freiheit leben. Punkt
I never want to see anyone or any animal get hurt however whales should not be kept in captivity for any reason.... definitely not to profit from. The are so majestic I don&#39;t know how anyone can be ok with them living in a fish bowl....not fare so cruel
When will us humans figure out not all of natures wonderful creatures want to be our friends or be locked up for our entertainment.
Didn’t get passed the ad, just came to say that looks like Vin Diesel. Everyone here is now family. See you in a quarter mile 😎
That had to been the scariest feeling on earth
That whale said Oh you wanna play
he is one luck bar stuard
This video is sooooo edited bruh
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT. KEEPING A ORCA IN A TINY PRISION.
The only sad part was the whale didn&#39;t succeed.
Killer whales should not be in captivity,the message is very clear
Exactly why wild animals should be left in the wild to live with their families and not stolen and forced to perform like circus clowns!
I Hope it does. Poor Animal being captured. To work there you have to be a Psycho.
What? And this wasn&#39;t expected?   You numb nuts.
Unfortunately the whale failed.
should not have whales in a tank simple as that.
Not any animal can be trusted😞
Orcas should not be kept in captivity.
Its not a Trainer.<br><br>Its a rapist of the animals. He really dont love them.<br><br>especially (killer) Wales have to live with their Family in the wild sea!<br><br>How can people find this amazing.<br><br>I‘ll be in shame for all of them
Poor whales 🐋 they don’t like being slaved n imprisoned
Free Willy
Let them free!!!
pretty stupid how he just sat there on the edge for a few secs when he finally got away from orca, orca almost got him again.
nothing was gonna happen lol
This video should be called: Stop imprisoning these highly intelligent animals.
Wow poor men.
I don’t feel bad for the humans, they are wild animals you can’t keep a killer whale in a pool and have them do shows everyday, they need to be freed
It&#39;s almost like these creatures shouldn&#39;t be locked up in cages for our amusement.
He wants to be free like areal whale you jerks🤬🤬💀🤬🤬!!!! How you you guys feel in captivity??  LET THEM GO!!!
Talk about terrifying. Poor trainer. And that poor orca too. Probably thought he was playing. They play like this in the wild too. We really need to stop having animals in captivity like this. It’s wrong.
That&#39;s what they get, maybe it will teach the dumb humans to not cage beautiful creatures for money sick people.
That&#39;s what happens when you put them in an aquarium!!!!!!
Definitely would be a dead whale
Perhaps his diving over the whale triggered it. They typicaly try to drown prey by landing on top of it and if Im not mistaken they do this to each other. It might have seen his diving over it as an attempt to drown it or perhaps as an aggresive behavior it needed to correct.
Title should be “Torture victim takes light revenge on torturer”
Just stop doing this to animals ffs!!
Good
Nobody went in the water to help him.
Better than being attacked by a tiger
I think that was personal he tried to drown and eat that man
Fu...the Circus Sh.., these are animals,not Clowns for the people..i am not worry with the guy.
Im just here for all these professional comments from all these people with creditable backgrounds in the matter 🤓
Taking these majestic beasts and making them do stupid pet tricks over and over until they are driven mad. No.
very sick and cruel what they do to these poor creatures. they do the same thing in zoo&#39;s we put them in a cage and exploit them for our entertainment and make the executives rich. how is that any different from the humans we enslaved and forced to pick cotton?
Haha😂
Imagine being able to roam the seas then be put in a small tank separated from your pack. Captivity is barely manageable with humans. Why would it work on other intelligent mammals who pay little mind to ways of man?
great, now who is in controll boy, in the open sea he would swallow this sucker
they are very intelligent creatures, they will not just attack a certain person because they are in captivity, this is surely due to massive mistreatment by this trainer
Good job, Orca.
Is this the same orca that killed 3 people? Also they are technically dolphins
Shoulda taken him out. Idk how these trainers can act like they love these animals so much and then be okay keeping them in prison and making them perform circus tricks😂 This is one issue I do agree with PETA on lol
Free the animals 😤
The way he ran when he finally got out of the pool was so sad. Like you could tell how scared he was.
Alternative title: wild animal held captive in a tiny pool against their will for our own &quot;entertainment&quot; responds appropriately
They need to put that whale down
Orca wants freedom should of killed them all
A bit of luck and foremost this trainer&#39;s own extraordinary endurance saved his life in the end. It was relieving to see the man resurface alive, catching his breath and make a final push to safety. Traumatic event even to watch.
Should have ripped him to shreds
And he got perfect help from his team..... NOT.<br><br>Let wild animals in freedom, we dont need them in zoos and facilitiys, when our kids want to see some animals, they can go in nature or watch them in TV/internet.
I wonder if they let that poor whale free? I hope so. I mean, poor dude but more so, poor trapped animal. She could&#39;ve destroyed him in seconds IF that was her intention.
You would think humans would know not to mess with the Apex predator of the ocean..but no
hwe was just giving him a taste of what they do to him
Damn son
We would’ve been eating whale meat all month
He survived because that orca was just scaring him. You really think that&#39;s the full power of an orca?? it could of been worse have you seen how they hunt their prey in the wild? Being calm had nothing to do with his survival
Close this place down already
One word  niceeee
Good, why do we torture these higly intelligent creatures into performing stupid tricks for even more stupid people. Away with this !
I think I know what Whale this was: Tillecum, the Black Fish.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They are called Killer Whales for a reason.
I’m just surprised that his foot was still in tacked. Wow!  Orca was definitely making a point. He prolly tired and is through with it. Glad he make it through. Cus Dawn didn’t. That one was sad. Yikes!
Yeah, that’s not a whale. But anyways, glad the trainer was ok.
Just remember Orca fans still smoke copium that an Orca has never killed a human even though they&#39;ve tried or have many times 🤣
those animals do not belong in captivaty in the first place
I thought he was vin diesel lol
Karma
They dont call them Killer for no reason.
Lesson learned?
That&#39;s what happens when you mentally torture animals by confining them to a 1/1,000, 000, 000 of the space that they&#39;re used to having.
Why this is still legal? Why people like yhis doesn&#39;t work? Just making money with wild animals. Bunch of loser clowns
No sympathy, hope the whale gets the next guy
Lol
All jokes aside I would’ve sued
This was a warning. She could&#39;ve killed him just from biting. She knew he needed air, she let him go and recover. Whale was making a statement I&#39;d say.
Miracle he made it , to be swimming with orcas is ridiculous to start with
the whale is literally &quot;See what you&#39;ve done to me, and what i can do to you with ease&quot;
The whale giving you mfs a warning. He was kind enough!
Then stop holding them captive 🚫🧢
If I were in a cage I’d probably do stuff like this
&quot;I&#39;ll let you go, if you let me go&quot;
So ....<br>Was this an accident or on purpose ??
Sorry to break it to anyone, but the animal didn’t make a mistake 😅😂
U got to be  entertain  by the tragedy in nature, it just makes me smile..!    = )
I think he deserved it. Leave these creatures alone.
🐋 “Had to teach him a nice lesson for giving me tuna instead of shrimp” 😁
My favorite sport is throwing seals into the air. What’s your problem?..whale
Again. Poor trainer. That’s why I don’t visit/support SeaWorld…those poor marine creatures should be loving wild and free
You wouldn’t get into the water with a great white or a tiger shark. It’s amazing that humans would get into the water with an animal that is more deadly and intelligent than almost all other predators in the ocean. Just for a stupid show that no one really cares about.
You keep these animal penned up in little pools for years and then wonder why they turn on their “trainers”. This is nasty business you do for money, even after people are killed. It’s disgusting! FREE THOSE ORCAS!
Its not a whale, its a dolphin. Just sayin.
It is called a killer Whale. The guy is lucky.
I will never ever understand why so many people love to play with their lives by jumping off massive cliffs, out of planes, swimming with the apex predator of the entire ocean.
WILD ANIMAL 🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
Good
Who ever doing this business should stop and we shouldn’t go see it 😢
I don&#39;t like seeing any animals in  captivity but Orcas/dolphins especially rub me the wrong way. They are on par with the most intelligent non-human animals on the planet and have emotions. The higher an animals intelligence the more it will suffer from being captive as it will be more aware of its fate. This should honestly be banned.
Change the wales name and send it to another zoo is what they do
Maybe if they weren&#39;t abused they would be nicer
It&#39;s cruel them Wales should be set free
They should end all of these places.
Killer whales, belugas and dolphins, along with Elephants, chimps and gorillas are too intelligent to be kept in captivity. I don’t care for Zoos but they do educate people so I’m not 100% against them but I draw the line at those animals
A great white in the open water would have taken more mercy on this man..a quick bite…let him bleed out for a minute and then come back to finish him off. It’s not personal..just lunch!<br>An orca on the other hand takes great pleasure in tormenting it’s victims ..even known to throw victims around between its friends for hours..just for fun!! They are the Geoffrey Dahmers of the seas..!!
Thats what happen when u put a wale in a aquarium and swin with it
Play stupid games<br>..
He just allowed the Orca to take him where she plased. He didn&#39;t fight, didn&#39;t panic, just held his breathe and went with it. Thats the reason he&#39;s alive today, didn&#39;t waste energy or oxygen trying to escape a vice-like grip.
That&#39;s why you don&#39;t keep them in tank you should just let them go out in the open in the ocean
🤣
they’re called KILLER WHALES
SeaWorld should have never been a thing! Shame on anyone who supports it
hands down to the guy, you need more than  experience to be that calm
Damn! So so close Willy!!!
Complete idiot to swin with an orca
Why don&#39;t they ever poke their eye? I think that would pretty much stop any animal. Maybe not though.
well it is a killer whale...
Every whale needs to do this so they can shut down this place of pure torture
I woulda been dead I tell you. Dead as a sardine. Wonder if he still has nightmares about this day.
I remember this when it happened. That trainer was incredibly amazing. He’s lucky that he maintained being calm.
This is what people deserve screwing with animals and their minds that don&#39;t belong there in any circumstance. Sea world is the most evil animal control camp there is.
Thats what you get for not leaving the animals alone.
God created animals to serve us.. not entertain us. Big difference.
That&#39;s why they&#39;re called Killer Whales. They like to play with their food before eating it. Muahahahahaha
Things to never do in my life: <br>Play with KILLER WHALES!!
Fire the cameraman
That &quot;Killer Whale&quot; needs to be put down ASAP!
I can&#39;t wait until this form of entertainment is a thing of the past. It is like living in the twilight zone for that poor whale.
Play stupid games,win stupid prizes.leave sea animals in the sea where they belong.
That’s what you get - punks - Animals are not for our entertainment. Free the mammals ☠️
But  nobody helped 😕
We live in hope.
Shouldn&#39;t be an attraction in the first place it&#39;s cruel and these are in a prison according to them they swim oceans not spectator pools
Getting in the water  with a killer whale. Yeah trainer so impressive for his composure. More like one of the dumbest humans on the planet. Keeping a creature this big and smart in captivity, totally cruel.
The orcas ability to stay calm was more impressive than his
That dude knew wtf he was doing to keep his cool like that when they surfaced. Well done in an intense situation. If he panicked and tried to escape that whale would have just taken hom right back down. That being said, this is what u get. That is a massive highly intelligent animal you sentenced to life in imprisonment for entertainment. You&#39;re lucky. Get a new job.
He was in a silly goofy mood
No one notice how to orca brought him back to the top? 👀 it could’ve let him die…
So what did we learn?
Ia still open this stupid show? How many park in 🇺🇸? Poor animal
Look at the part when he jumped in he landed on he fin and back jumping other her he landed on her 😳 I can&#39;t believe nobody noticed that
Looked like he clipped her when he jumped into the water like landing on her top fin ? Can anyone else see that part he jumped in landing on her
Did he jump in landing on her at the start when he jumped in the water?
WATCH THE DOCUMENTARY...  &quot;BLACKFISH&quot;...   HORRENDOUS...   ALL ABOUT HOW SEAWORLD, IN THE 60&#39;s, ROUNDED UP PODS OF ORCAS, AND REMOVED THE CALVES FROM THE PODS... WITH THE FAMILYS SCREAMING IN GRIEF...    ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE, HOW LOW HUMANS WILL GO, TO MAKE MONEY
Ouch me foot
this is why i will never swim with a killer whale. why people swims with orcas are just kinda crazy to me
there is a reason the name isnt be your best friend whales ..
Probably deserved it.
That trainer is part of a horrible nightmare for sea animals. They are not there. the animals. because they like it. They aren&#39;t having fun doing tricks. Research Seaworld and similar parks. And please, take a few minutes from you hectic schedule to do just that.....go learn something. Commenting about how brave or composed a POS is pretty silly.
“ abused whale attempts to free itself from captors”
Teach you for locking up a giant animal in a puddle of a pool.
16 years ago, and this has happened multiple times since, but yet they still are allowed to keep these animals in captivity and have whale shows. Makes sense…
Sea world is despicable
I think he say to the whale &quot;it&#39;s not your fault&quot; trying to keep himself composed and the whale let go of him because he was calm and peeting him maybe helped. The fact that he was not acting like prey Moving back and try to get his leg free but more stay calm shake head Peet the whale and stay Alive ;)
Let wild animals be on their own, but sorry for the trainer
I wonder how a trainer would feel if a bunch of orcas made them do tricks to entertain the masses!
WHY DO YOU ALL CALL THIS GUY A TRAINER? HE IS A MEDIEVAL PRISON GUARD. KEEPING A INNOCENT CREATURE IN CAPTIVITY OR PRISON FOR THE PLEASURE OF IGNORANT HUMAN BEINGS.
Good!!! Anybody who takes a job that includes imposing undeserved suffering on sentient wild animals deserves what ever they get! If I ever went crazy, I&#39;d go to Sea World and pick off every one of those animal abusers. Long live Tilikum!!!!!!!!
Was just trying to train him to hold his breath longer let&#39;s be honest if you want the best coach in that field it&#39;s deffo a whale
No damage to the trainer’s foot, considering the strength of the creature. My theory: Katsaka’s teeth were caught on his suit. She was swirling trying to loose it. At the end, she kept him a float.
A highly intelifent and magestic apex predator born to roam the seas like a king, now confined to a tiny habitat and forced to do tricks for treats - I would be upset too.
I would have knocked that whale out if it grabbed me
very nice very cool he should have died
Humans-Hey whale, how about you leave the beauty, freedom and majesty of the entire ocean and spend the rest of your life in this awesome pool?<br><br>Whale- Sure. How about you do the same?
These animals are your prisoners, they aren’t your pets!
Got no sympathy at all
In my opinion the fishy should have eaten him
That&#39;s what you get for keeping such a beautiful wild animal as a free show. Go on the orca
Lol!! Well, he deserved it.
I just love how the others go nowhere towards him even though he&#39;s clearly swimming to the edge 🤔 they just left him 👍🤣 poor beautiful creature trapped in a place for human amusement, I&#39;m very amused now though thanks for that 👍🤣
Should&#39;ve known she&#39;s grumpy before breakfast
Seaworld sucks
Looked like the whale was coming back for another round at the end.
Danggg dat whale said now let me see you do some tricks 🤣. This is too sad poor man. I know he was scared for his life.
It&#39;s crazy to me how humans put themselves in these types of situations
Such a shame these places even exist.   You stick any an animal in a tank that uses echolocation and surround it with cheering morons banging on the glass etc. it’s pretty much torture.   They oughta put the owners heads in a metal trash can and beat on it with hammers so they can relate to the whales daily life.   These are such intelligent and social animals deprived of communication with others, no room to roam as they can travel thousands of miles in a few weeks, and the outrageous stresses that their tiny pools provide for them.   Sea World has 600 pages of incidents involving erratic behavior and aggression towards their capturers shouldn’t that be enough to shut these awful places down?   Guess not.   Don’t visit these places because it’s nothing more than paying soulless people money to gawk and cheer for their animal abuses.  Unless that’s your thing and if so u are a horrible human being.
The only thing that saved this guy was his calmness in the face of death. Animals will do animal things so don’t lose your mind when it eventually happens.
Good. Whales belong to the oceans 👍🏽. They warned him
It&#39;s pretty disgusting they swim in the water with the animal and it&#39;s feces
Keeping the whales cooped up inside a tank in order to charge fat-assed people admission to watch the whales do cheesy tricks?  That&#39;s barbaric.
Maybe if it killed him they would have learned there lesson. I wish orcas would attack people in the wild so we wouldn’t think we’re their friends.
The orca could have killed him, but it didn&#39;t, just letting the human know it&#39;s displeased with it&#39;s living conditions
I think he was abusive to the whales and they showed him who really has the power.
deserved
This guys knows what he’s doing but this whale knows she could had easily killed him if she wants to.
Hmmm a 200 pound human and a 5 ton wale. Yea the intent was meant to drown the human, even when a whale can&#39;t even comprehend the concept of drowning, because ya know... They live in the ocean. People can be so ignorant.
Poor whale. I have zero sympathy for humans that cage animals in zoos, aquariums, water parks, etc. They should be free. This whale probably hates all those humans. And for good reason!
Tillikum killed 2 trainers jus tnot during a show like this
The only sad thing is that the whale was not able to finish the job
Now that’s the sort of killer whale show I’d attend, to see the whale turn on its trainer is worthy of my attention. This highlights that these creatures shouldn’t be made to perform like they are. I’m glad the guy’s ok, but these aren’t animals who should be stuck in tiny tanks.
it was really entertaining.
I’m glad he wasn’t killed. That said, maybe gigantic fish shouldn’t be forced to live in an aquarium being taught how to balance a beach ball on it’s nose.
The whale should of killed him it&#39;s horrible keeping whales in a pool and the nerve thinking it&#39;s ok to swim with them locked up
There is something kind of poetic going on here.
I wonder if he was hitting the whale or was like please buddy. Please buddy.
Can baldie please tell us what type of whale that is?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😆
&amp; this is why you leave wild animals in the wild<br>Let the babies be
The whole situation is just horrible in every way, on every level. Despite the sins of the company, I&#39;m glad this guy lived.
Idiots, let the whale free
Orca is not a whale.
1 minute 12 I timed it. If that’s real time that’s not a massive amount of time for a diver or trainer but I bet that felt like an eternity being held against his will. Glad they’re working to end this though. Dolphins next!
Trainer: Let&#39;s show them a trick!<br>Orca: Let me show YOU a trick...
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freewales">#freewales</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stopseaworld">#stopseaworld</a>
It makes sense. Killer whales are extremely intelligent and belong in the open waters of the ocean.  SeaWorld is no life for them. They probaly hate listen to a trainers. This was probably more of a lesson than anything. That trainer got lucky.
“IF YOU MESS WITH THE BULL, YOU’LL GET THE HORNS” !!!
This video needs sound
The whale was only trying to show this dude what it feels like to be trapped.. The whale was like at the end free me up man
This is what you get when you act like animals was your toy.
Just leave the killer whale alone, set it free and everything will turn out just fine
He deserved it. Little criminal holding that Orca hostage in a tiny pool.
They torturing those beautiful animals every day,  your &quot;show&quot;  is clearly torturing with creeper sound all day long what they must listening, always starving as a part of their &quot;training&quot;<br>Horrible humanity, shame on you<br>FREEDOM FOR THOSE ANIMALS you poor clawns
Big red tried to sneak a feel
he must have the lungs of a sea turtle too hold his breath
Cruelty for human entertainment.
Good Job from the whale, wild animals are wild animals thats their instinct
Ohh nearly whale nearly , try again
🤣
I trained a whale 1 time.<br><br>And 6 years later it bit my finger so ..and made it feel numb
Looked like he was having a whale of a time
Selbst schuld schade dass er nicht verreckt ist
Nature win
Надеюсь, что этому циркачу больше не придёт в голову наживаться на несчастных животных. Этот урок он должен выучить на всю жизнь))
Orca: you always want to play with me inland, its time we play my way, deep in the water. :) no doubt thats just the orca being playful, too bad its bad for your health. If the orca wants you dead. Youre dead.
Never mess with an apex predator they are not tamable
Hahaha
HOW IS A WHALE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT THIS GUY CAN&#39;T BREATHE UNDERWATER?
I guess this is why they should be kept in wild not for shows!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6-GkIzzzFg&amp;t=190">3:10</a> this is terrifying
Why didn’t they do anything?
thats like having a goldfish in a little bitty tank.  let it be free.  Maybe it was trying to talk to the trainer.  Saying do you like this ?  Well let me out
This is pure nightmare fuel
guy was obviously terrified the way he scrambled out of harms way...the orca turning round has he swam off had my heart in my mouth.<br>I don&#39;t normally watch this kinda thing but saw it was 10 years old....hope lessons have been learnt...leave wild animals alone! they were not created to be trapped for our enjoyment!
Brilliant
They are NOT pets. They should NOT be on display in this vile manner.
The whale says you don’t believe in the Bible you don’t believe that I swallow jonah in my belly for 3 days and 3 nights let me show you that JESUS CHRIST is GOD
They should make more shows like this 👍🏽
All I can say is, set the whale FREE!!!!
Leave animals alone!  You enslave them for entertainment, eat them for pleasure.  Just let them be free like you’d want to be free. This message is for everyone. ✌️
The orca in her mimd thought let me train you
Oh no! 🙄
Got what he deserves… these animals should not be caged in a pool… all these zoos are guilty of animal cruelty for profit
An Orcha is not an ordinary fish. It is highly intelligent and knows about it&#39;s surroundings. He knows that he&#39;s in captivity and being played with like a toy.
Ja wild animals are wild.that is why they should be in the wild not in captivity
so sad that he didn’t take the warning and ended up getting killed by a killer whale :(
They shouldn&#39;t be training these wild animals to do tricks.  There massive powerful creatures.  Let them be just that.  But anything for a buck right.
It is interesting to see this only happens in captivity!<br><br>Let these magnificent creatures free!!!<br>They deserve better
Free them all
Most people don’t know that these animals are meant to be free and you can’t blame the animal for retaliating for being trapped.
Too bad it&#39;s not a whale.
Lol that orca was like “you white devil! I’m tired of your sh!t”
That&#39;s not a whale..... ffs
Animals are NOT toys for human entertaiment! This is not the right place for this poor animal.
how can you be so heartless and lock such animals in tanks for fun and entertainment. Deserved!!
Don’t capture whales and this won’t happen. TOOOO EASY
im sure hes working at a gas station right now
Just a small tiny little glimps of what he could do to that stupid little human.
Orca’s should not be in captivity.
Can&#39;t blame a wild animal for doing that, thats the risk you take.
Sadly the whale didn&#39;t manage to complete the job :(
They don&#39;t feed the whales so they deserve it
I read this as &quot;whale nearly drowns&quot; and got really interested into how that would actually look
The day that Jeff Bezos decided to start Amazon
Dont worry, Killer Tons a big softie.
Leave em alone then
Video’s fake
At the end these animals are extremely dangerous predators, God bless this guy, he was lucky that day.
I thought that said: Whale nearly drowns. 😂 I was like: STUPID! Then I was like: Why am I? 😢
This was her warning to them
This art of animal entertainement is discusting as F...
Let them free you greedy monsters!
That poor creature shouldn’t be there in the first place!!!!!😢😢😢😢
This is a display of restraint and kindness on from the orca. Instead of tearing the &quot;trainer&quot; apart (trainer is in quotations because the so-called trainers here are closer to imprisoners than anything else), it decided to gently grab his foot and make it clear that it didn&#39;t want to be toyed with. This is an apex predator we&#39;re talking about, killing this man would be so effortless. I&#39;m only speculating it&#39;s intentions, but it as it held him on the surface it even nodded its head, sort of threatening him, that it would drag him down again if he continued to pester it. These animals are so intelligent I can&#39;t even fathom what it was thinking, but to me it seems like a clear effort to communicate, that it was tired of how it was being treated and wanted to be left alone. I&#39;m so happy that Sea World is no longer breeding them, they are such amazing creatures
100% the Orca let him have his life...
Cruelest thing keeping such an intelligent creature imprisoned for it&#39;s entire life. Wish it had killed the trainer.
😂
That’s not a whale… sorry I had to be that guy but somebody had to say it.
Shame he didnt drowned. Would have been a statement from the captured animals
Let Willy set you free!
Looks like he was praying after the Orca brought him back to surface..watching this sent my anxiety to another level😰
The orca
Hes trying to get even to bad he DIDN&#39;T succeed
yha nhe!!! white people <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23shoutout">#shoutOut</a> to ya!!
Orcas arent whales
It kills me how orcas are one of the most lethal animals in the wild yet humans thought doing shows with them was a good idea
Get these beautiful creatures outta captivity, away from circus tricks and returned to deep open water. Problem Solved! Otherwise you DESERVE whatever happens!!!
Dude is a legend!!!!
whale was like that&#39;s how I play Human. How do you like that?
They can go back into wild it should be illegal to keep them
A bullet right in its eyes would have solved the problem
Humans trying to be funny with nature........
I am awed and also scared by these incredible creatures because their intelligence is astounding, she was doing as she was told performing she just added her own part to the show which obviously the diver who cannot hold their breath underwater couldn&#39;t handle
And now after the movie has come out we know why!
Seaworld should be forbidden!
Sea world abuser almost gets what he had coming would be a more appropriate title
Before he swam out he was thinking I&#39;m so lucky to be alive I have to find me a new job unfortunately and why didn&#39;t they come to help me
One of the most satisfying video I&#39;ve seen in a while.....how does it feel to be on the other side?
Context is that this mfer trainer was abusing the orcas when they did not obey him
O waw, it chose to spare the trainer
I wonder if he stuck his hand in the blow hole if the whale would open his mouth? His hand was in reaching distance the whole time. Guy was so scared he tried running even when he was in safety. Just scared out of his mind.
We capture these animals, take them out of their natural habitat, and lock them up in a bathtub and wonder why they snap like this 🤔
Keep wild animals who live in vast expanses of water in a glorified fish bowl and these things will happen. Free all whales from captivity...
Serves them right. It was toying with him. With a bite force more power than a great white, he wouldn&#39;t have a leg if the orca was seriously attacking. No animal should be held in captivity
She tried to drown him because she was mad
As you can see a captured adolecent orca playing with humans. What could go wrong
Orca shows at seaworld not as exciting anymore.
He should&#39;ve die... the world would&#39;ve been a better place
Sadly its almost
Trainer? You mean warden? 😅
I bet it took him a while until he got into a shallow pool with an apex predator again...not a single ounce of sorry do I feel for the man...seaworld is a horrible establishment
White people akways trying to tame something it’s a wild animal….leave it alone and let it be free in the ocean
A fact about Orcas. They are the APEX predator of the ocean. Not the Great White Shark. The Orca is the apex. Why we think we can tame them, I will never know. Yes, they can be gentle and have shown intelligence. And just like any animal in captivity, they can learn conditional behaviors. But at the end of the day, you don&#39;t jump into a pen full of wolves and expect to get out alive. Orcas are the wolves of the ocean. This animal could&#39;ve taken this trainer down under the surface and chilled for 20 minutes before needing to come up. The trainer would&#39;ve drown at 3-4 minutes, and totally dead at 6 minutes. Tell Sea World to stop getting into the water with these animals.
They get what they deserve keeping a wild animal like this in captivity
Shame the orca didn&#39;t succeed
I just don’t understand why they don’t have a plan for something like this. It’s wrong they have these awesome animals in these tanks, but they all just sit there and let the man be within a minute or less of drowning. All to not cause a panic or scene in front of the audience. Just ridiculous.
That whale needs a stern talking to
This is was too scary damn
That&#39;s got to be a sickening call to get on the paramedics end... a killer whale trainer has been pulled under.... it could be a few tooth marks, it could be a bitten off limb, it could be a death.
If people let animals and wild life in peace, things like this wouldn&#39;t happen so yeah, sorry not sorry
just feel sorry for the whale, who lives in captivity
He may never take a bath again?
Hope it hurt
Keep messing with nature you f*<b>***</b> idiots, it&#39;s all about the money I guess, I mean as humans it&#39;s cool to see what we can achieve but that doesn&#39;t mean you should do it all time
It’s cool and sad at the same time that they can actually train these beasts
These animals are not pets. Human beings need to understand that animals are not here to entertain us. I was glad he escaped with his life, but I hope they learn.
Sorry to say but this is what humans deserve   In situations like this.  Maybe someday we will learn
Damn so close too better luck next time
Don’t take animals out of there natural habitats and make them do shows they shouldn’t be doing and this wouldn’t happen simple as that
It’s not nice to see someone suffering, but things like this need to happen to remind humans they can’t do whatever they want to whatever they want
Karma this is what happens when you abuse an animal like this
Probably a reason why we shouldnt hold that im captivity?! ...
I love watching animals destroy humans! To bad the guy lived
🤣  dude lost some cool points after he ran and fell when he got out of that pool
Everything happens for a reason. What can you expect if you lock an animal in such a basin and do not treat it according to its nature?
Welp that’s what happens to an oceanic animal in distress trying to swim in a pool thats only filled like a bath tub
Killer whales are bloodthirsty creatures without a doubt. This creature should be put down immediately.
You have to be real stupid to hop in the water with the worlds deadliest predator
Leave the fish alone.
That&#39;s why you don&#39;t swim with them
even if the diver remains calm not exited there’s crowd shouting and full of excitements and that’s more than enough to stir up the giant beast.
No Comment
Orca: nah we&#39;re just playing.
Human stupidity at his finess. Let those wilds creatures in the ocean morrons.
Anyone like it when a killer whale kills one of its captors...
Y&#39;all just never f-ing learn do ya. 🤨🤦🏽‍♂️
Not putting large predators into a bathtub would be a learning lesson. Unfortunately im sure they didnt learn that lesson and the orcas are still in the bathtub, arent they?
When will we learn these amazing huge predators of the sea are not for entertainment 😢
Incredibile that Jeff Bezos would not only survive a deadly orca attack, but also become the richest man in the world. Props to him.
Wow ,that was close
That man’s got some strong lungs. Amazing he didn’t drown.
100% deserved <br>Lock up the most peacuefuel wild animals<br>That never attack human in wildlife<br>And youl get what you deserve.<br>Soon or later all orcas will hate us cause the people like this trainee or the people goingand watching the show<br>Spending money to capture and torture this beautifuel animals that are supposed to safe our planet in the wildlife.<br>Yet humans just bad.
I feel like she knew what she was doing holding him under, so much so that she also knew she would be sad if she killed him. So she also knew to bring him back up.
It&#39;s a crying shame the whale let him live
Eu sou o comentário brasileiro que buscava
If this was my life I would have drowned them all.
😆 yeah keep putting wild animals into captivity.....works everytime.....until they get tired of your 💩
Stoopid hoomans
You can never train a wild animal
This should be Orca spares trainer&#39;s life.
The Whale’s thibking: ‘Not nice being trapped mate is it?….’
The moment that all fish that have found themselves on the end of a hook, celebrate 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
These comments 🤣
I still don’t understand why they have whales locked up n abused at sea world like what you think is gonna happen when u have a apex predator doin bs tasks in a lil kiddie pool eventually it’ll get bored and guess what now homie hunting you😂
BOOM
NOW
Give me my money
It’s so clear and obvious what it’s trying to tell them. They’re incredibly smart.
This kind of reminds me of the beginning of nope.
no partisan liabilities against employer
Completely against any animal treatment like this sod seaworld
I was cheering for the orca.
he wanted to show the trainer how it feels to be free willy
If everyone knew what happened to these poor whales at that terrible prison...they&#39;d understand exactly why the whale did that in the first place. End of story.
😂
🐋: think it twice next time
Serves him right
never play whit nature,,,,
This is the dumbest entertainment
People deserve this for captivating these amazing animals 😊
Karma.  Almost got what he deserved
I would’ve quit right there.
Here is an example why it’s stupid to put orcas in such a small pool, or any animals by the way.
Rich white people almost killed this guy. 🙁
Wow is all I can say to that, fair play to the trainer for keeping it real 👏👌
You know that man had never been so grateful for air in his life upon resurfacing
i hope this groups of people will get it back from thr nature … next time will have the whale succes ❤… stay strong orcas before this circus !
Everytime I watch this it&#39;s when the world haves me feeling down and then this reminds me to man up this man handle it like a gee never panic once 👍👏👏👏👏👏
I don’t feel bad for the trainers. They’re in this to not only profit, but gain clout.
Whale: &quot;I told you I want the day off, are you gonna approve it or what?
Orcas don&#39;t belong in pools they belong in the ocean. Wild and free
Imagine the absolute fear, the way he panicked after he made it and thought it was coming for him again!
Omg...
Willy let him live another day
Strange how they would save a person from drowning in the ocean... yet they want to drown one in captivity... I wonder why
I would do that to my captor too
Is this the same whale that killed the female trainer?
Good!
He killed her he didn&#39;t nearly drown her he killed her ok its sad
sea world put human like animal, they just care money. human just Expendables asset or just a toy
Honestly that’s why they don’t keep them no more
thank you  cbs news
Liberen a esa ballena!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Leave the animals and kids alone you weirdos
Workers comp
SET THEM FREE!!!
Let the poor animal in the wild again people need to understand this poor whale is kept in a small tank like the orca whale Tilikum
Did he quit that day
Not surprised. Leave it alone and put it back where it belongs.
seemed like he thought it was gonna start running after her on land lol
so there was no one to help him if that situation was to arise?
Crulty.  To. Them. Poor.  Anmails. They. Should. Have.  Always.  Been.  Free.      Stayed.   Free
if this was in a movie theatre it would be so terrifying. divers really amaze me with their comfortability in open ocean
What was sea world doing while he was being attacked?🤔
Now this guy has a whale of a tale. Do you they did it on porpoise?
WILD ANIMALS ARE NOT PETS...stupid human being... never learns
Amaizing how his foot was in that apex predators mouth yet not a drop of blood..
Skills!@@
OMG!!
Wow##
Miguel ayyy miguellll
Good watch for sure,I was hoping for some broken bones or blood and snot,but never mind.
I don&#39;t believe in luck.....God saved you sir. Be thankful 🙏
These companies are taking large predatory animals and putting them in confined spaces with humans then trying to make them do tricks–its kind of a recipe for disaster if you ask me.
Those animals should leave the  Orca in the wild.
The trainers should carry some sort of knife strap to they’re wet suits at least a couple
This animal is not a toy...it belongs to the sea!
El precio de ca$garle la vida a los animales.
LOL!! Too funny.
Katsaka let him live. 🐳
Ok well better luck next time whale
That’s what happens when you cage a whale in a fish bowl
Killer whale almost caught a body
Free willy
POOR ANIMALS!! this type of places should be banned

Humans think like whales and whales think like whales
RIP😂
and this is a perfect example of why a wild animal should not be held captive.  I&#39;m glad the trainer is ok.
He deserved it
We&#39;re missing the dramatic music.  Something like Jaws.
What do you expect when you put such a majestic animal of that size in a bathtub?  Eventually, he&#39;s going to snap.
He deserved all of that
Yessssssss
Lucky boy!!! He must have been seeing his life flash past.
He will let you go if you let him go.
There shouldnt be kept in there
That Orca was like &quot;we gonna put on a show today&quot;
Stop enslaving these beautiful creatures for you macabre amusement. It’s unethical. That orca probably just wanted to scare him and send you all a message. Could easily have killed him if it wanted to.
My heart breaks for the trainer and the killer whale people have to understand that these are WILD animals not GOLD fish in a lake , it&#39;s sad for both sides 💔🐋🦈🐟🐬🐳
Such a beautiful noble a uninspired. He was teaching him a well deserved lesson 👍
you really are at the mercy of that whale...killer whales should be on the wild and not the pond...when will people learn..smh!
Nearly? What a shame.........animal abusers at their finest.....
Wild animals should be free nit in a tank.  Shame on you Sea World.
The sad truth is if orcas killed more trainers then they wouldn’t be taken from the wild for shows. They belong in the wild, they’re the apex predator of the oceans.
Y&#39;all do have them  all trained
Killer whale .... heloooooo

Dishonest reporting.  First part of the video is a completely different video with a crowd present.  The second video is in a private area that the trainers practice in.  You cut the two videos together shame on you.  The whlae was taken away from her calf and was angry about it.  This is why people don&#39;t trust the news anymore
Oh well they drown they drown. Shouldnt have beautiful mamals in captivity.
When will humans learn that we’re actually their toy and they belongs in the wild 🧸
Don’t play with whales because ur actually their toys 🧸
Maybe it’s time to stop keeping animals in captivity
A lot of people in the comments commending the divers behaviour like it was an avoidable accident. This is terrifying and that poor guy and his colleagues are putting their lives at risk every day so a bunch of idiots can sit in the stands and clap while they eat a hotdog. It’s insane that animals this big and this clever are still being kept in giant swimming pools in the 21st century.
&#39;It&#39;s time for his noon feeding&#39;.
That’s was the Orca letting you know who the real boss is! Stupid humans think they are it’s trainer but in reality they there capturers or keepers! The Orca knows this and doesn’t want to there when it could be swimming free in the vast ocean! I never have and never will go to watch Orca’s, dolphins, seals or penguins perform like this! It’s exactly the same thing as a circus! No difference at all!
This all should be banned everywhere  in the world the keeping of these beautiful creatures in captivity its so wrong
That’s what he gets. Should sue sea world. These animals are not meant for captivity.
What worries me is that nobody seemed to do nothing to help him get out of the water.
Bien fait pr lui j&#39;aurais aimé que cette baleine finissent le travail .
Better luck next time
Did it snap his ankle?
The orcas get bored, what did u expect? 🙄 glad he&#39;s OK but they need to free the orcas and quit being selfish, uncaring, unfeeling jerks!
All Sea World staff, owners, managers, investors, everyone involved should be JAILED!
Rumor has it he quit his job as a ln Orca trainer and started slinging seafood at an Orlando Red Lobster 2 weeks after this.
Revenge
Well humanity KARMA is a bish
This is not a pet.this is  Wild animal-killer...
Qu horror de seguro jamas de metio de nuevo.
he should be happy nature did this calm and polite way to tell that this is so wrong to use living creatures this way to make money and feel like gods.these animal workers,company   owners deseve to give atleast an arm an leg back to nature.
Theses  thing happens when you take a animal that belongs in the wild and put him in a cage
Just wish it was with audio still good vid, Orcas killer whales deadly. That guy the truth respect
Shame that must have been traumatizing 💔
Why mute tho
Traurig das ihr es noch nicht begriffen habt . Den armen Tieren geht es nicht gut in Gefangenschaft... Die Menschheit ist echt dumm und egoistisch.

This is what happens when you play with fire. Good job he kept clam and that&#39;s what saved his life.
Isso que dá se meter  com a natureza e achar que consegue CONTROLÁ-LA !!!!
Wales dont belong in a f seaworld park! Do you think animals enjoy their captivity!?
Nearly got his comeuppance. Keeping Killer Whales captive is just wrong. No sympathy for the trainer.
Sencillamente la orca queria divertirse con el como ellos hacen con ellas por que si lo hubiese querido matar wow una mordidita y ya
I mean its to be expected if u prison and torture emotionally an intelligent animal. Not much sympathy for the torturer, only for the poor Orca.
Lol lol lol 😂😂😂 o well
If it was me.. While underwater I would have spooned its eyes out  till it let go of my leg.. Js
Stop playing with one of the Smartest Killing Machines on the Planet, Humans are absolute idiots thinking we are the Alphas!! we are not.
OMG!!!!!!!!
a whale belongs in the sea, not in a bathtub
GOOD ON THE ORCA
How did he hold his breath that long?
That&#39;ll teach ya,I bet he doesn&#39;t work with  Orcas anymore.
He deserves it. Anybody involved in any way with the captivity (torture) of marine mammals like this deserve the worst fate has to offer.
So many emotions here. Firstly, I&#39;m so happy he survived. That was absolutely terrifying, but he held his wits and knew that he needed to try to stay calm AND that her need her to be calm, too.<br>Second, I read that this orca mom was separated from her baby which is just sick! I&#39;m going to leave it at that. <br>Third, no one blames the orca. Period. I also don&#39;t blame the trainer, either. By the way he&#39;s interacting with her, her obviously cares for her quite a bit. He wanted to work with her for the right reasons, his love for this animal. <br>Fourth, I would love nothing more than to have these animals freed, but it&#39;s not that simple. Orcas are mammals and as such, don&#39;t do things solely by instinct, but largely by teaching and instructing. Some of the orcas were taken from the wild, but others were born in captivity. The ONLY way to release them would be to also teach them how to hunt. If an orca doesn&#39;t know how to hunt, it cannot eat and will die a slow, painful death through starvation. There&#39;s also teaching them about territory and migration (in the case of transient orcas). They need you know how to navigate the waters, how to avoid being beached or stranded, and to understand that boats and a great number of other things are dangerous. They also need you understand that humans they encounter in the wild are NOT the same humans that held them captive. An orca has never attacked a person in the wild, but releasing a captive creature into the wild that has been habituated with the presence of people is something they also need to be taught about. <br>In order to release these animals, there needs you be a reintroduction program to teach the beautiful creatures how to survive on their own in the wild. To do anything else would be amazingly reckless as well as careless. That, or make a reserve where they can have plenty of natural space to live, but where they can also be monitored and fed until they can become familiar enough with the natural outdoors to be able to be let go.
Pfff people destroy ewrything on this Planet,orcas DONT belong to Swimmingpool
In the beginning when he aggressively claps over the whale&#39;s nose, and the entire group claps to get the whales exited and jumping... then the contrast when he gently rubs the whale&#39;s skin getting her to let go of him and be calm.
Shame good job well done orca
Let these whales go! They are not for our entertainment and this is what happens when you bring a wild animal into our world!!!
He seems traumatized and scared of the orca ;(
It’s crazy to get into the water with an unpredictable sea animal!
Typical people would expect this enslaved sentient being to not hold a grudge. They are expected to be cheerful and happy. They were stolen from their families and forced to work for profit for greedy h7mans. We expect them to be grateful because we treat them so well? Really? Mammals have emotions and I would not be mad at this Orca if it did drowned the trainer. This crime is allowed because there is a demand. Trainers should quit their jobs and put these greedy corporations out of business!
Lungs made of steel this lad.. glad he was ok
Lawsuit
Una lástima que no lo haya ahogado. Dejen a los animales libres y en paz, imbeciles!
That orca could&#39;ve done wayyy more damage. I honestly think it was sending a message
These whales are beautiful animails.
😆 🤣 😂 😹  get me outta here
When you see how these wonderful creatures behave in the wild - incredibly intelligent and sensitive - and then see them reduced to performing monkeys, it disgusts me. I have no sympathy for anyone who contributes to their suffering. To quote Blackfish; never capture what you can’t control.
Lucky man.
I love Orcas ❤
Lesson learnt, no animal should be help captive
This is a another reason why they should realise the orcas ,the orcas are getting abused and holding grudges against the trainers
it&#39;s like the orca wants to show who is the real boss in the pond.
This is a subject that has kept me up nights. Orca and a few other animals aren&#39;t capable of adjusting to life in captvity. Reading thru many of the  comments I saw most know and agree and I hope the day soon comes no country on this planet will allow the heartless and selfish act of taking any Orca from their environment and the close bonds they develope with each other. <br>Please anyone who hasn&#39;t watch Blackfish and while legalities in some areas must allow their capture to continue replacing  over and over the Shamoo s  and others. <br>Sea World tries to keep a secret about the Orca and their inability to adapt to life in captivity,  worse even the health decline, depression and dissatisfaction that drives some to acts like repeatedly swimming into their enclosure walls to the point of euthanasia being required unless they die on their own. <br>Others take their frustration out on their trainers an act like someone else  commented hasn&#39;t been documented in the wild. Strange the top predator in the ocean capable of even killing Great Whites has never attacked humans untill taken from their families and home forced to live in to them what would be a bath tub to us. <br>Wonder why Sea World cannot see the obvious and why after banning their capture here in US our government continues to allow just captured from  elsewhere the same animal that has near a  zero chance of survival even less a quality life to be brought in and kept here.<br>I urge everyone please get to know the lifestyle, the requirements they depend upon and what  happens when deprived of those needs and confined.  If laws continue to allow Sea World to operate obviously without care or thought of Orca s or employees why reward them by attending any facility they have or anyone else..<br>I thank all that took time to read this.  God bless you.
The escape was whale orca-strated.
And this would never happen in nature. The trainer is not smart , he is just lucky. Just stop supporting Seaworld. Orcas do not belong in tanks for your joy!
This is child&#39;s play, one time I got my pinky finger biten off while petting a 🦒 at the zoo
Is that guy &quot;special&quot; swimming with a 12 thousand pound killer whale that&#39;s male, when they had 3 female orcas in heat separated in the same acuirium. This is not good.
F seaworld orcas should not be kept in captivity there are no recorded fatal attacks on humans by wild orcas and from what I&#39;ve seen the extremely rare attacks that have happened weren&#39;t fatal and usually a case of mistaken identity they only act this way in captivity I&#39;m glad this guy was able to survive but these animals should be released and protected never held in captivity
These beautiful creatures DON&#39;T BELONG THEIR! I WILL NEVER, EVER STEP FOOT AT A SEA WORLD! CAN&#39;T STAND THE PLACE.
His wife is racist, had her as an English teacher, 5 or so years ago. She called me out in front of my class for my ethnicity. I was young and can’t <a href="http://forget.lol/">forget.lol</a> funny how the world works. She showed us this video in class and claimed this was her husband 😂
Hey man that sea horse looking whale took him DOWN!
He ran off fast. That is crazy
Good!
Leave animals free
Being an animal is a very difficult thing when it comes to communication. They have very limited Communications how they feel and sometimes the animal will lash out at its owner or trainer. I&#39;ve seen it with elephants I&#39;ve seen it with horses I&#39;ve seen it with lions and tigers. Pushing these animals to do things that are not natural in there National environment has resulted in the discontinuation of the training of the trainers in relation to the Orca
There is no such thing as training a WILD ANIMAL
The whale was extremely merciful to him. Sea world does not treat their whales with respect nor do they even care if their healthy. Despite their claims, an orcas dorsal fin is not natural to the side. Sea world should be shutdown forever, and the captivity of whales, orcas, dolphins, sharks, etc.. should be illegal across the globe
DON&#39;T PLAY WITH KILLERS,LOL,,U GET WAT U DESERVE.
The whale wanted to say &quot;that&#39;s enough&quot;...
when we understand that animals must live free and not for our pleasures it will always be too late
Somebody should be in the water in case something like this happens, ready to rescue the trainers! It&#39;s unfathomable that there isn&#39;t safety measures in place for the trainers and water acrobats.
The whale has enough.
These are wild animals. They should not be held in captivity. And never ever should a human be interacting with a wild animal! When are people going to learn and stop supporting this inhumane animal exploitation purely for human enjoyment!!!!
Free them!
Ohh look the orcas have so fun guy&#39;s 😐!!? And if they not make what they want they give the orca no food and isolation him!!! 🙁The orca make it cause he have to do it with violence
Why would u keep a whale in a goldfish bowl?
Animals like orcas should not be kept in captivity.  Incidents like this or worse will continue to happen until they stop captive breeding programs.
Poor orca being kept in a pool just to entertain people. I feel for her
That&#39;s a dolphin.
Humans will never tame a wild animal.
Dang! They should call these creatures Killer Whales!
Great whale I will also killed my kidnapper 🤣
&quot;release me, just as i released you!&quot;  - kasatka
I only feel sorry for the Orca ...they gave her the stupid Name Kartinka(oh so mysterious and  cool🤢) What was he thinking? That a  wild animal would do nothing and would say ThAnK YoU, so to speak,  If a little creature , who is telling  her what to do and what not and even whithdraw her from Food sometimes wouldnt  finally is behaving like this???They even took her baby away, and the Trainer is Part of seaworld , too. , So He is ALSO guilty, He saw all the abuse, HE abused the Orcas!!! If someone would stomp on my Belly and nose all the time ,I would get angry too . And let&#39;s Not forget:These are animals, biiiiig animals, but without tlhe understanding Humans have! On the one Hand pple  blame the poor orca , on the other, they always say &quot;tHeSe aRe aNiMals. , DOn&#39;t MeSs WiTh &#39;Em&quot;.<br>Sometimes I am ashamed to be a human,  really🤦🏼‍♀️
The orca tried to teach us a lesson, but we didn&#39;t learn
I love this video 😂<br>I´d like to tell every single orca in captivity, attack every human you can get.<br>Maybe the sh*t will stop then
Anyone good at lip reading able to see what he was saying to Kasatka?
I hate that the whale didn&#39;t finish his game
SeaSh*t 🤢 I can&#39;t say how much I hate this whale oppression organisation. But I wouldn&#39;t wish on anyone such a dangerous encounter with a whale (although it&#39;s foreseeable...)
Whale: Let me show you who is the real boss little man.
These killer whales don’t belong in captivity. I’m sorry for the trainer.
LOL well deserved
That&#39;s why johnny sins never played this role again...
Wow that is hard to watch
More captive elephants have killed their &#39;trainers&#39; than any porpoises. Animals that are not being saved/rehabilitated should be left alone...in their natural habitat
Terrifying
Classic, good for the whale , he got what he deserved..
This whale was playing. Does the whale know a human can&#39;t hold it&#39;s breath as long? Killer whales are super intelligent but sometimes trainers live in a fantasy world. Maybe they&#39;re better off training unicorns!
That orca was sick of that guy&#39;s sh*t.
Anyone that goes to these shows should be ashamed of themselves.
It&#39;s almost as if, these are wild animals and shouldn&#39;t be kept in large tanks..... weird.
orca is meant for the sea not in captive so don&#39;t think u r so smart that u can tame them. free them!
When I was young I used to love Seaworld and thought it was so cool but now that I’m older I don’t like the idea of it at all. I think it’s a little bit different than the zoo in some instances, a killer whale doesn’t want to be in a tank doing tricks. It needs to be out in the open sea.
🤮🤢😢
Why on earth didn&#39;t he cover the whales blow hole up..
Lucky dude, his expertise and let&#39;s be honest here, the whale saved his life
You have to be a special kind of idiot to get in the water with a huge animal like that which eats pretty much anything it wants.
I called this &quot;wild animals are meant to be free, not trapped&quot;.
Imagine having the entire ocean as your back yard then someone for entertainment purposes shoves you into a bath tub . The orca wasn&#39;t trying to harm the trainer ,it could have killed him in a matter of seconds . It most likely was trying to express it&#39;s frustration 😔
Quando  estão sos no tanque ficam infelizes sofrendo privadas da liberdade na natureza

They aren&#39;t called rescue whales......
The Orca was obviously under stress not being in an open ocean! Diver is so lucky and will need therapy for pts.
I hope the Orcas chew the heart out of their captors. Typical white behaviour trying to enslave everyone and everything.
they should be out in the ocean. not in glass enclosures.
He’s truly blessed! That would be my last show!
Bisogna finirla di fare questa cosa con le orche con i delfini ma a cosa serve ?
Stop captivating animals for human entertainment and income. Majority of them die because they are forced to live outside their natural environment
No audio dislike
Nice job
If I was a mother I will NEVER take my kids to Seaworld or any other places that wont respect animals environment, space, and feelings
Too bad the trainer survived.
Trust me that whale is is smart enough to bring a human back up before he even could drowned to death
That&#39;s why I dont swim with giant killer fish
Good for that whale!! As much as they&#39;re all tortured, and thank God (Blackfish) has exposed what these beautiful whales are put through. These trainer&#39;s make them able to snap at any time. There&#39;s never been a human attack, death, or even close to an attack. That Documentary put me in tears. And I can&#39;t say I feel bad for any of these trainers. It&#39;s sad 3 have been killed. That blood is on there hands. But when you torture, starve them as punishment, keep them in a 20ft wide x 30ft deep pool for 14 hrs. All because they wouldn&#39;t perform. And the most inhumane thing! Ripping a calf from her mother, and moving that baby to another SeaWorld. Watching that mother scream and cry at record high decimals, by experts. I don&#39;t feel bad AT ALL! For any staff from the owners to the trainers. You&#39;ve changed these beautiful, harmless, friendly whales. They just want open ocean with there pods, and families. My sorrow is with these whales, and no one else!  🙏 🐋 🐬 God bless them all..
Free the animals to avoid this,  if you want to see them them go to their natural habitat..
The whale is racist. I&#39;m suing CBS news
Why do people give the trainer so much credit for being calm? I&#39;m 100% convinced that was not the first time he went through that,
Why don&#39;t the others try to go in and assist or distract??
They don’t call ‘em Apex Predators for nothing 🤷‍♀️
That&#39;s what happens when you mistreat a wild animal
It was a fair warning. Let me free.
The Whale wanted the man to stay alive, otherwise he would have died that day
He saw the trainer go over the line net and did exactly the same. Smart
they want out of there...free them
If you would be a whale... what would you do ?
This is what happens when you keep Orca captive in tanks.  Glad he was able to keep his head.  What a terrifying experience.
Human nearly drowned<br>Whale: What tired already Hooman? <br>After reading YT comment section: I was being playful. You didn&#39;t tell me, you cannot hold your breath as long as I do!
This was great.
Watch Dominion for the truth!
All hearts be free! Go vegan 🌱
Hahaha  what a stupid Trainer. These are wild animals....
Not everybody loves sea world , the whales in particular
These animals shouldn&#39;t be in captivity and forced to do tricks for human entertainment. Imagine being confined in a small place for the rest of your life and forced to perform every day, its disgusting! I&#39;m glad the man survived but I hope this experience made him realise the damage that has been caused to these animals and the role he has played by training them. If they can no longer survive in the wild due to human intervention then at the very least the shows should stop and they deserve to be placed in a more spacious habitat.
Embrassing moment?
Tha whale knows that human needs air to survive, she was so vingative.
I wonder how bold was the first guy in history who tried to tame a wild orca.
Cool video. It would have been better if the guy died in the end.
That’s one intelligent animal. Knows exactly what they’re doing.
It&#39;s just not worth keeping these animals in captivity and have them doing this over and over for human&#39;s entertainment.  They&#39;re bound to snap at some point.  They are intelligent animals.
That’s a warning shot if there’s ever been one. Katsaka could have ripped his foot off instantly. The fact that she did not even lacerate his skin shows she was not biting him, just holding on to him as gently as she could. Considering their bite force, this in itself shows incredible restraint, gentleness, caution from the Orca, and undeniably shows she went out of her way not to hurt him. She also knew to bring him back up to breathe without waiting too long. Even at the end, as he gets away, she gently turns around and moves slowly. Had she wanted to, she could have charged and gotten to him in less than 2 seconds. She allowed him to swim away. Katsaka standing still after letting go, letting him pet her shows she enjoys contact with her trainer, has a bond with him, and was not trying to hurt him. She simply made a show of force, caused by the frustration and pain she was feeling after being separated from her offspring. Really no different than a child/adolescent yelling or acting out when they feel their caregivers are not listening to them &amp; instead emotionally affecting them. Only in this case, Katsaka really is the top dog that will always win the fight, if pushed to that point.
It was still the whale’s fault. Everything that went wrong here is the whales fault. Glad the man is okay, but those are wild animals. They are lucky the whale didn’t swallow him whole.
Eu desde que assisti a estes acidentes nunca mais fui ver estes espetáculos. Animais devem estar no seu ambiente natural.
Don’t go to SeaWorld!!! 🚫💔💔don’t be ignorant!!
Not the animals fault. He was just playing like he does in the WILD
Was erwartet man wenn man wilde Tiere in Gefangenschaft hält und sie behandelt wie Spielzeug. Bin trotzdem froh, dass nix schlimmeres passiert ist aber selbst schuld. Hab kein Mitleid mit solchen menschen. Orcas gehören in die Freiheit und sonst nirgendwo hin.
I feel so bad for him! He did so well in this situation. I’m so glad he’s okay!
