They discussed masculinity when it was not a woke topic. Appreciate it
also men from up bihar and haryana when they come to cities and see modern confident working women with their boyfriends or husband being in love they feel alienated as they haven&#39;t seen anything like that in their villages where women are just an object to shit on them.
haryana and up bihar have men with the most yuck and disgusting mentality these two words i would like to describe them with
I think much of this can be applied to other countries besides India.  We have the same problems
Khan ji Aapke Bareme v kuch Boliye.
please we want this show back
Wished he had invited SRK too
This episode is just amazing ❤❤
Its almost a decade now... but film industry is still making movies like Animal and Kabir singh... And they are getting money...
Amitabh Bachhan is so well spoken. wow
Is Deepika not fluent in Hindi?
We need these types of shows❤
These shows were much better than today&#39;s Sandeep maheshwari shows...... According to my perception....
We need this show back
🙏🙏🌹🌹
Kuch janvron ne insano ka jeena hram kar rkha hai 😡😡
Bless the journalist who told the father of his son&#39;s written letter. It helps a lot to know the final wishes of the departed, whether good or bad
My husband did not let me go to my grandmother&#39;s funeral, who raised me after my mother&#39;s death. No body deserves that type of creature as husband.
Kangana Ranaut ❤
Now everything is happening in Reverse 😆
I am so glad that such great shows were there on television when I was a kid (I practically still am)
After 7 years.... Amir Khan is getting married for the third time with an actress who&#39;s younger than him 😅😅
Issh show me Deepika didi ne kahi ki ye baat me yaad rakhungi, but Pathan movie me  aapki Jo song hai, usme app ye baat ko vul gayi sayad,
Please bring back this show... My younger generation need this not animal.
Still bollywood is not awaken about those all issues what they have discussed and making content like besharam rang, gehraai movie, animal movie etc.
I salute true thoughtful message of kamla bhasin mam❤
Who&#39;s here after watching dhruv rathee animal video😂
after watching animal I somehow got a flash back for this episode and came here to check why animal movie was wrong
Plz come back again satyamev jayate 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️
Aapka hal alra TV pe yunus alGohar  ke pas hai
Please restart this show..
Deepika said she&#39;ll be careful. Went ahead and did 4 item songs.
The show is very needed this time....... please bring back this show 🙏 as we can see an increased crime  nowadays at its peak...... society needs to be aware!
Aur iske bad hi deepika padukone ne  besharam rang song kiya jo ki bikini m tha or iske lyrics bhi sunna ap sab 😮
9 years on still no change so many sex contents still
Funny this 3 gals are talking about all this when these gals are so bold doing many intimate scenes
Still watching this.....
Great show
why deepika has nothing to say 😕 she&#39;s only listening 😅
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Super work
Kangana ji is symbol of humanity...❤❤❤

5days ago i went out of my house in search of a shop, it was raining and i was looking here and there to check if any shops are opened, it was 6am at the morning. A scooty was right behind me, i thought maybe someone wanted to park his scooty so i didn&#39;t thought of anything else but suddenly that guy he was just right behind me with his scooty and he spanked at me so hard!!! I was shocked!! Didn&#39;t knew what to do,i couldn&#39;t move for a moment, till i realised that i have been harrassed and i have to do something it was to late! That guy passed by me on his scooty, i tried to note his scooty number but my eyes blured out! And also i tried to chase him but i couldn&#39;t. I went back home crying drenched in the rain, feeling helpless and humiliated!
Mere mangetar ko bhi ese hi maar daala tha ab se 21 saal pehle me ab tk nhi bhool payi wo hadsa pta nhi uski family kese bhooli hogi
Please satyamev jayate ka naya season leke aaiye
I watched satyamev jayte when I was 11 year old, I want this show again but in the form of digital era, because, dunia kabhi nhi sudharti agar ekk awaz utane wala shant ho jaye to, uske liye lge rehna padta hai 😊 ek na ek din ummed hai ki kuch na kuch to badlega hi <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23satyamevjayteagain">#satyamevjayteagain</a>
After 8 years, prople need to see this!! Egoistic people just to show their strength unnecessarily harm others. Dont know why people are so aggressive. Its so saddening and scary
This show was genuinely good.❤
Kangana always Answering brilliantly 👍
❤ It was a Great show.
Beautiful episode! Much needed to create awareness in society ❤️
There is no law and rules in pak and ind..
This show was ahead of its time
Kangana 👍
Yes.. Deepika ne bahut dhyan rakha iske baad . Besharam rang isse pahle shoot ho chuka tha
Amitabh Bachchan is so true even in the whole industry Abhishek Bachchan is a behaved actor. Never interrupt others matters, Aishwarya chose the right one.
Actually  boys ki upbringing  pe depend karta hai
Start this program again Amir khan ji
Watching in 2023 and want to back 🎉🎉satyamev jayte ❤❤

Movies can also make Positive impact very intensely that is also a Positive side of film 🎥
Love their way  Kangana voiced her  thoughts.She is so elequent. Proud of her ❤
Aur pk1, pk2, plk3 banayo, parda dalne ki jarurat nehin.
This video is very powerful everyone must see this
Kamla ji is one of the gem 💎 she can explain any thing easily and Sha has vast knowledge as well. Pls start the season 3 without Amir Khan pic someone else he don&#39;t deserve it.
sir please season 4 jaldi.....m waiting ..apne bhut acha kaam kiya hai...
It must be restart.  🙏
Sir abhibhi bahut students aise hai ki vah depression mein hai because unake family members.<br>Bahut se parents&#39; aise hai ki vah parents unaki childrens ke samane zagada karate hai<br>Vah parents ko itna bhi nahi pata nahi rahata hai unke baccho par usaka kya impact padenga <br>Phir bachche unka mind aise bana lete hai ki vah class mein topper se zero ban jata <br>Aur bhi bahut students aise hai ki unako lagta hai unake parents sahi hai but real to unake parents wrong hote hai .<br>Vah students ko yeh bat samzni hogi ki unake parents wrong hai jab vah students yeh bat samzenge <br>Tabhi vah students depression se  bahar nikal payege . because maine bahut sare aiese bachche dekhe ki unaki depression ki vajah sirf parents the
Sir students ki gundagardi ki wajah unake parents hai but crime karne se jyada crime ko ignore karana hai
Deepika padkone to pathan me kitna Ganda video dikhaiye hai yai  kya baat kar rahi
Comrade Kamla 🌹
The reason we need TOP G
the whole concept was presented very wisely and in a very much convincing order, I greatly appreciate and from the core of my heart, want to have such awareness programs more frequently  in both of the countries; India and Pakistan as we are in dire need to understand the value of humanity. hats off to Amir Khan for this show.
We want it back
😢🙏👏💪🔥👌👍
Lol deepika🙄you shouldn’t have said that.
2023🍁
तीन तलाक और हलाला पर जो episode है उसका लिंक दीजिए
Deepika is clearly out of box with almost zero inputs..that&#39;s why education plays an important role.
khyal rkhungi besharam rang
लिया
Deepika ne bahut dhyan rakha hai ki wo kya seekh de Rahi Hain.😊
Deepika ki aankhen khul gayi thi, is show me ane ke baad, isliye usne pathaan me nangapan dikhaya, aur bhi kai ghatiya movies kar dali. I hate doglapan in Deepika. Atleast kanagana Jo boli wo karti bhi hai.
Wow Kangana❤...even Pariniti very intelligent and responsible at their talk👏👏...Dipika is almost dumb in such conversations, more because she is opportunist bug instead of any responsible figure 👎...see her avataar in Pathan... Simply Besharam! ...<br>... besides, Amir&#39;s every effort, gestures are very praiseworthy indeed👏👏
In the start as they were cutting things from the list that men don&#39;t have this and that I want to clarify that I&#39;ve seen many men and women both having all those attributes so you cannot make a generalistion based on gender.
deepika&#39;s humbleness and accepting the fact that she was not that aware, is commendable .
❤❤
n still deepika doing the same think
We so need satyamev jayate back
Amir Khan can never dare to talk about halala ,triple talak,Taliban and genocide of Kashmiri hindus
Came to watch just because of KR<br>The Queen 👑
....... aap ny chand waqiat note kar liay jin mein ek insaan ko mar diya gya, to kiya us din jis din ye bura waqia huwa sirf ek hi accident huwa? us din sencron accident huway hon ge aur 99 hadsat men logon ne ek dosray ki madad kar ke insaniyat ko bachaya bhi ho ga magar us ko aap ne routin ke hadsat mein dal diya, halan ke un waqiat mein kisi ne apni jeeb se paisay kharchay hon ge, kisi ne apny kapry kisi gher ke khon se kharab kiay hon ge, kisi ne apni gari mein zakhmi ko dal kar hasptal pahunchaia ho ga or apni gari gandi ki ho gi, ek baat yaad rakhiay, agar burai ka zikar zayada ho ga to burai ko bharawa milay ga or agar achai ka zikar ziada ho ga to achai baray gi
Just so appropriate to illustrate what notions are associated to masculinity in the Indian society.
The fact that even after 8 years 75% films r still same nd even degraded bt  I appreciate tht atleast these 4 stars took it srsly nd try to sync it in films
After attending this show Deepika dancing on &quot;besharam rang &quot; hypocrisy ki vi sima hoti hai 😅😅😅😅😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=1173">19:33</a> 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
very nice soch .Thanks for bringing up these kinds of truth revealing episodes
Worth watching. You covered a topic that is a dire need of our world.
Sala chutiya mard ke problems nahi bata kar sala harmi feminism chod raha hain
Look at all kangana&#39;s answers , so mature, to the point, thoughtful.
Amir khan has done the best work to discuss about all these sensitive topics.
One thing i noticeed in thus video Deepika is a good listener....
Yes men are very aggressive!! At home on the road colleges !! The parents has to teach their sons calmness peace and manners
I came here for those actresses but going out as a very different mind set
And yes never to make her realize the whole time about her past if she changed
I believe a definition of a true man is if we as a woman can accept their past even if they had with a lot of girls but he&#39;s willing to change for you and never to repeat again after you being with that person in a relationship if we women can do that I think men have to leave the ego when it comes to accepting a girl with a bad past including her relationship with men in the past if she dedicates her whole life for you change yourself for you leave all the past behind me become a good person that should matter and also she should respect if she respects you and loves you takes care of you and your family that&#39;s I think it&#39;s more commendable you cannot have ego and love because you go in love is like water and oil they cannot go along with each other they are separate.
Deepika ji chup hai kyonki unko sudharna hi nhi hai <br>Aj b wo pathan or gehraiyan jaisi movies kr rahi hai
mulla naeem khan attacked laxmi, and she lived in mulla dominated area too as she described khan market, that&#39;s why no one helped the maal e ganimat girl. moral of story, be organised against mullas and katwas.
Here Deepika said ki aage ye sab me dhyan rkhugi ki asa but same chiz recently usne apni movie me kia h itna revealing costume phna h Pathan movie k gaane me to didi tumne kya sikha kuch bhi nhi
Only for kangana ❤️♥️
Huge respect to kangana 🔥🔥🔥
❤️❤️❤️
Yet Deepika is still doing the same 🤷
Deepika is so dumb.. kangana sounds intelligent n parineeti talks about reality..
Who wants this show should be continued further
You won’t believe that I was just watching a movie call table 21 and that movie is about Rougin in the school and college has had a look what you just came up watching Amir Khan episode about riding in the school college
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3940">1:05:40</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3990">1:06:30</a> Now after 8 years also Doing the same thing Deepika, one should not be this much ignorant.
Only Deepika took it seriously and made a movie on acid attack &quot;Chappak&quot;
I was late to the party to watching satyamev jayate cuz Hindi ain’t my first language. But after seeing post that it was one of the most genuine and authentic shows I have ever seen…
Such an increadible show it was !! It stroke initiation of taboo topics like child abuse , sexual Harrasment in Pakistan too .. Kudos to Amir for his contribution to Indian Ceneima and Panni foundation
Thanks
This is first time I am feeling really &quot;jealous&quot; from India as a Pakistani. Because if this continues, then it will really take India to the heights of development and prosperity very very fast.<br><br>But it was really shocking to me when Deepika said that she didn&#39;t know that movies have such an impact.<br><br>Amir khan and Kangana, it&#39;s really high of you for accepting the mistakes so openly.<br><br>And that old lady, Kamla, she has such an accurate, true perspective. She is my real heroin.
Kya in teeno Actress ko ye baat ye episode yaad h , kya vo in cheejo ka dhyan rakh rahi h ab
Kamla Ji Ki Taange Uthaao Koi Jaa Ke
Ab Kangna kitani badal gai ho
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3507">58:27</a><br>but  he  DOES  COMEDY  through  his  DANCE ... makes  audience  LAUGH ... it&#39;s  a  TALENT ...<br>@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3758">1:02:38</a>  in  my  case .. my  parents  NEVER  ALLOWED  me  to  go  to  school  on  a  bicycle ... i  used  to  go  to  school  in  a  META - DOOR ...  😂🤣😅<br>boys  used  to  bully  me  even  then ...  😿

Wow.
Sir Zabardast<br> Allah apko Salamat Rakhe <br>Ameen
Sab log thodi ase hote hai
The thing is that 80 % of people including girls think of toxic masculinity as cool but nonetheless we need to stay away from it
Pavan honesty

Sir aapko sat sat naman hai    janta ko jagrook ka
This show was the best thing ever aired on Indian tv.
I loved that while talking about the Cinema Part Amir Khan did not exclude his movies and songs which shows that he takes accountability for his previous works which is a very good sign of a beautiful human being!
Amir Khan you are absolutely Amazing and all your programmes are Absolutely Amazing too. Lots of things that are going on in our life should be changed in order to make the difference in the world. Love and Respect from London and Pakistan 😍 🇵🇰 ❤ ♥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3711">1:01:51</a> accepting your own mistake is a great thing that most people don&#39;t do
Old thinking films should be banned!
Dont show old films on tv, as shown in this episode!
Aamir bhai don&#39;t play the game for those how are hhey suffering this problem plzz...aapki baat koi nhi manega
Sab naatak hai bhai ...
just like movies tell men what girl&#39;s like,,, they also influence what girls should like about boys as well...
Aamir you are still making such movies
Jo ladkiyon ko chhedte hai woh apne heejde hone ka saboot de rhe hai......jab inke behen ko koi chede toh unki hawa nikal jaati hai fir inhe ahsaas hota hai....

Please next show I request
Larkiya bhi line marti hai larko par
This is not masculinity,but the misconception of masculinity 😡
Ye sab En Actres ke drame <a href="http://hai.show/">hai.Show</a> pe aane ka baad ye sab bhul.jate hai enko Sirf paisa aur publicity chahiye
Agar filmo mein Real life bohat Antar hai.jaise ye printi Bol rahi hai To aap jo real life mein Hota hai wo dikhao na .Aur Ache cheje jo smaj ko Achi Guidlaines dey Aisa kuch filmo mein Dikhana Chahiye
Deepika ka &quot;you know&quot; &quot;you know&quot; me hi khatam ho gaya bolna... And she still did items songs after this...
I appreciate the men who are being so honest. It takes courage to accept. A narcissistic can never do that.
Ab kuy nahi aa rha hai
Mard ka koi nahin hisab hota hai
Mardaani ki baatein nahin jaati
So guds
Sir please es show ko vapis chlayie🙏
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=2990">49:50</a> the old lady&#39;s point of view is also very true and thoughtful.. We haven&#39;t seen suicide of female farmers...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3731">1:02:11</a> whatever parineeti said I have experienced the same and trust me it feels like a rape.. Relating the events happening in life with movie is another thing but vice versa is not really good experience to have.. In my case the boy was so powerful and smart he made the scenario look like he is doing this because he loves me..The boy was ideal man for all other people and someone who respects women who knew him so no one was ready to understand my point of view..It was the nightmare for me and people need to understand this thing that sometimes person can be a good human being for whole world but at the same time he can be the worst partner to other person.. And I guess at the end ladke ko ladki nahi uska jism milta hai.. I am still trying to move on with everything happened with me.. The only lesson I took from this is marriage relationship all these things are not meant for me..
Kangna is best
Idw illogical dramas keep on going for years and meaningfull shows like these can&#39;t have more seasons
)
Kangna, deepika aur en sb ne kabhi sex scenes nahi kiye na
But not all men are same
Shusil  kumar  kash ye episode  dekh leta khand karne se phele
This show actually Gives knowledge More than Schools and So called books. <br>But nowdays in our new generation, There is no value of gold and teachings<br>If god sees us equal Then why can&#39;t we.<br> Men And woman are totally equal... <br>God invested equal time to Give us birth..
Kamla Bhasin mam just rocked it!
Ye show again start hona chahiye
Ye jo 3 deviya yahan bethi hai <br>Ab kon sa ye apni kayem hai <br>Ghatiya harkate wali films toh ab bhi bann rhi hai
Amazing sir god bless you for this great mission.
Laxmi is the very brave girl 🙅🏻‍♀
Who the hell can dislike such awareness program😡😡😠😠🤬
Same old male bashing.
Amir you are doing nice job, be honest to your self and call your both x-wifes and let them speak openly.
Sir ye topic bhut accha tha
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3565">59:25</a> so you see here , amir sir too regrets his past films
According to Bollywood love starts with molestation.
Cutie Kangana
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=940">15:40</a> aapko case fight krna tha thik se
Kangna jhut bol rahe hain....
In heroinaon dekh kar hi mard bhek jahte hain, aur yahan ye heroinein masoom ban bhete hain. Aj ke picturaon mein Romance kaise hota hai bataa te hi nahin. Isharaon mein baatein aur agla scene bed par. Ab ladki ko bed pur lejhane kyliye usne kya kiya ye tho bataa te hi nahin, to hum kaise sikheng ladki impress kaise karna. Afterall hum ye sab filmaon se hi shikte hain. To agli baar aisi hypocrites celebrities ko maat layiye.
After 6 year of uploading this video the view is 3 millon viiew and  item songs  in few months are like munni badna hue getting 100 million  <br>Hence Proved,RIP to the Indian  society and its belief
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3110">51:50</a>
Satymevjayte frse start hona chahiye 🤞🤞
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=343">5:43</a> isko kisne item bola mujhe milwao usse.. this is so damn stereotypical.
I don&#39;t why ppl come up with &quot;not all men.....&quot;, But reality is there are enough men in this country who suppress women and think they are inferior, the good ones are very less, so instead of saying &quot;not all men are bad&quot;, we must say &quot;we have enough men to make a woman feel unsafe&quot;
Aj ki kangna me aur tb ki kangna me bahut fark j
Deepika ne bohot kam bola but jo bi bola bohote accha bola
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3660">01:01:00</a> Kangna 👎👎
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3570">59:30</a> I&#39;m glad that amir khan included his film also.<br><br>And his apology <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3695">1:01:35</a> Great.<br><br>And that&#39;s y now aamir khan is so selective towards signing his movies
I feel this show must go on star network must restart this show again 🙏
Amir khan true gem💎i hope firse ye show start ho ❤️💟 star plus bakchod serial bna na bnd kro or Satyamev Jayate firse shuru kro netflix or amazon prime sbb fail hai Satyamev jayte k samne
I think Satyamev jayte 2 ana chahiy <br>Nyi mudde nyi soch
Kangana Ranaut dhongi nakli indian 🙄
Hamare Punjab mein asani se person ko maar dete mamuli baat se very bad punjab verry very bad punjab
Punjab police very brutal very bad person no manner

throwback to when kangana talk sense
in papiyo ka nam chehera bhi dikha dena chahiye
Stop big boss.......... Continue this show👊👊👊👊
this show is way better than bigg boss!
Ab Pta chala k Pakistan mein  india jesi Movies kiyo nhe bun pati. Kiyo k Hum Aurat ko aesa nhe dikha sktay
👌👌👌👍👍👍💕💕🙏🙏🙏🙏🇳🇵💐💐💐💐💐
Shit Kangna!! You have ruined yourself for political opportunism..
Dipika mam is very humble and pure heart
Look at Deepika she has no sence ...look at her expression ..she must feel kitana tough hai exam ...she has no sencs
This is absolutely an amazing serial which you had start Aamir ji ☺️🙏 words can’t describe you how much deep respect I have for you ☺️❤️❤️❤️
Then he goes and play in a movie like thug of hindustan
Wow movie&#39;s toh aisi thi. bt one more thing I want to add, aur kuch bacha tha toh aaj web series chal rahi hai<br><br><br>Ghatiya... Ye industry kabhi nhi badal sakti .......<br><br>Nd no one is real here expect Amir khaan sahab.
Gar ma sachu kahiye to bi kem trust nai karta che tamari pase  ....Bahu kaiye to bi faltu bijani....Bolo samir che javab
Sad to know that even after this program, item numbers, semi nude songs with women just dancing are still being made and people still appreciate
Nowadays  kangana is hypocrite
Boht shi ❤️🙏
Kangana making sense it so surprising
So true.....if boys were to take care of house like girls then both girls and boys can share responsibility and achieve progress....I wish parents would treat them equally so there is no place for inequality.....thank you aamir khan for motivating show....some scenes gave me tears ....
सच पूछो तो शर में ही बसती है दीप्ति विनय की , संधि वचन संपूज्य उसी का जिसमे शक्ति विजय की ।<br>सहनशीलता , क्षमा , दया को तभी पूजता जग है , बल का दर्प चमकता उसके पीछे जब जगमग है ।
Yeah..films does affect the thinking of people bt cant we  just use our brain to distinguish between reel and real nd also right and wrong..??!!
What about Har Funn Mowla, sir?<br>Isn&#39;t it objectifying women?<br><br>Such hypocrisy, wow man!<br><br>All Bollywood actors or actresses are more or less hypocrites. Its the actual truth!

that ragging story was too painful. the victim should get justice! the pain he must have felt at the end, must have been really unbearable. that letter broke my heart. nobody deserves that
Few yrs back we have time n mind to  witness these talk shows......now a days pheww
Kamla bhasin.....what a sense of humour u have
Luxmi u r too cute....gladly i saw chhapak in theatre......i adore u cherish u.....how brave u r....love u
I am a pediatrician....mbbs batch 08...<br>I witnessed ragging...like bullying scolding badly from seniors...but in boys it was very bad as i heard from them...<br>This is not the way of interaction...senior junior is not that imp....respect is imp work is imp time is imp life is imp...what i assume today
We need this kind of show now a days
I just cried 😭 father n son
Big big big shout out to AMIR for this !!!
Today I saw this because it was trending on Twitter and my respect for kangana really rose more than ever she has been these things for so many years now
Aamir, Deepika and Parinati are all such fake people.  They never did or followed whatever they said.  Kangana is the only one who has taken a stand and stuck to it.  Kudos to Kangana.
Who&#39;s here after Kangana Ranaut&#39;s tweet? Let me know
only legends watches satyamevjayate

Women say that men should not let out their emotions and when these emotions bottle up and men get violent then they blame men for all the problems in society and spread misandry
If you have self control <br>the all these negative qualities <br>can help you rule the world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=585">9:45</a>

Masculinity is not the problem the problem is masculinity being used in wrong places. Instead of using aggression and violence against a helpless person, that aggression and violence can (and is) used to protect our borders, freedoms and citizens.
All fault are in parents what you teach , what you get.nowadays most of man satisfying there ego through fighting
Many films show stalking and harrassment as &quot;romance&quot; (not only Bollywood but some even some regional films). This has been happening since a long time and unfortunately still persists. 😔
aamir Sir please aap phir se ye show start kar dijiye🙏
Kangana is really intelligent and insightful amd deepika is just a dumb
Kangana ma&#39;am you are such a great lady ❤👏
And mard ko dard nhi hota =_= meko gussa aaraha hai=_=
Love you lakshmi didi

Amir khan is real hero,
In the end its the women who happen to contribute a lot in the upbringing of men, if a mother teach his child how to behave these problems they are facing now will be a matter of past.
सत्यमेव जयते का अगला एपिसोड कब चालू हो रहा है मुझे भी भाग लेना है
Aadhi se jyada aabadi films ko dekh kr hi bigadi hai
if that is the case then why don&#39;t these stars stop making such movies?
Yes womens admi ki madadgar hoti ae admi nai great 👍 👏
I am very very sad for the two aggrieved parents and many like them. Indian people,  be humble and friendly. Make your society a peaceful one. And do not watch movies showing violence. They have a psychological effect. <br>Sympathies from Pakistan
Didn&#39;t Aamir khan perform in an item song in the Thugs of Hindostan movie after this?

My Opinion about Musculanity:<br>Allah ne mard ko powerful banaya hai women ke nazdeek (Physically and emotionally) Is liye Aik MARD ke pass Leadership qualities honi chahea<br>Aik sequence mai batana chahun ga:<br>1) Apni Family ke liye ( means ke khana paani , rihaaish , betion ki shadi, un ki zarooriat ka khial)<br>2) Apne khandan ke liye ( apne khandan ko jor ke rakhna)<br>3) Community ke liye ( har aik to jante hue har aik ke kaam aana jitna wo kar sake)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=466">7:46</a> wah Aunty ne kia zabardast baat ki hai 👍👍
Theres big difference in reality and what we see in movies.. And I m glad Aamir khan sir accepted that in front of everyone and that&#39;s the quality of a man and hats off to this show for bringing this into limelight.. People need to understand the fact that movies are only and only for entertainment purpose and nothing else so as an individual u should be able to differentiate between a movie and real life..
Yaar ye bohot hi bhayanak hai hamare country me.. Matlab koi kisi ki jaan le leta hai for no reason aur fir bhi wo bail pe chhuta jata hai and then judge bhi bolta hai chalo kuch compensation lelo tum aur niptao bat ko..What the hell man...comlensate krna hai to Akash ki jaan vapas kr do yaar uske ma baap ka to socho thoda..  I m still crying after watching this in 2021..Woww our Great Country.. life is very very unfair to some people.!!
Wonderful seeing again n again. Once more Satyamev jayte

So sad 😭😭
This show should come back....we desperately need at this time.
Bs Kangana he ab cheap item songs ni bana ri, Baki Deepika aur Parineeti to bs bolne k liye h...
why are women allowed to speak about Masculinity, How they can speak on being a man but we can&#39;t about how to be a girl. And there&#39;s nothing wrong about Masculinity . U can&#39;t prove ur Point by saying some right points irrelevant to topic
What a great show with excellent messaging for the society - there is a lot of learning in this show to improve the society&#39;s behavior - please continue show like this as it is very much needed.
ये शो बस महिलाओ के लिए है आदमी यो को इसमे बदनाम कर दिया है
There are actresses who have not done item songs like kalki, Radhika Apte, richa chadda etc<br>These people don&#39;t get enough of recognition because obviously they didn&#39;t do item songs. Hypocritical society!
I am waiting for season 4
Kamla Bhasins comment about honor was spot on!
I love satyamev jayate show and I want this episode to be translated in pushto and Persian languages but I don&#39;t know if it is possible or no, because I can&#39;t do it by myself and I thought if there is any translator app through which we can do it, and is it legal dubbing of this video or no, is there anyone to guide me please  !?!?!
Aaj 6 year ho gye h but aaj bhi kuch nhi bdla movie main
Please bring more sessions I m missing
Pls again start to this show
Aamir should call Salman khan for footpath accident
Agar mard itne hi nikkame aur nalayak hai to shaadi mat karo na koi jabardasti thodi karega shaadi aplogo se kyun bhai log mard to emotionally weak hote hai

masculinity is nothing but a prison
Deepika weed fuk ke bethi h
Kangana always stand out ❤️
deepika druggist satyamev me kya kar rahi hai?
This show should be restarted this is the show that can change people thinking
The year is 2020 and Kangana is still  same.... Queen
So sad to see the state of Indian society even in 2020 . So glad Aamir is shining a light on these issues
Look at that druggie Deepika. Soon she will be in a jail.
Kbhi janasankhya kanoon ka bhi samarthan kr de

Now where are these fake views... parineeta ji kya baat kahi h... drug mafia ko btaane me kanagana lagi hui h or Tum log usko support tk nhi krre ho.. shame on you and you all are fake..
Dono kanagana k aage stupid hi lag rhi hain... Kangana is beauty with brain 🧠 👏🏻👏🏻😊
Every filmmaker while making films should keep in mind as though they&#39;re going to first make their children watch. And there the negative things in the film will be realised by them
Pura show me itne important and sensitive topics pe baat hua<br>And people be like kangana, kangana kangana S<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23it">#it</a>

Watching in 21 August 2020<br><br>So Deepika is giving so Bitchy looks while kangana is talking on the point <br>Deepika is keeping mum and just listening and watching them she doesn&#39;t speak on such issues openly back then also <br><br>We ignored kangana for a very long time now watching old interview realisation has come <br><br>Deepika needs to use her voice in right direction and stop doing item songs too bitch🙄
Hats off to Kangana Ranaut for your brave and sincere efforts to make the society aware about hidden truths of this glamour world <br><br>More respect to you for SSR support 🙏
I don&#39;t think anybody is this perfect like you are saying Mr. Amitabh. In any household there&#39;s no husband who don&#39;t scold their wife and there&#39;s no father who don&#39;t scold their child and even beat them to teach them discipline when they are wrong( Because children are naughty and they don&#39;t listen to anyone) . When you said you never laid a hand on your children..I don&#39;t know how you are teaching your children . Please teach me also
I feel bad for Lakshmi, whose face was burnt by acid - that man who threw acid on her should be castrated and the woman who helped that boy should be hanged. Are you kidding me? What kind of uncivilized society do we live in? That boy who threw acid got married - seriously, are you kidding me?
Kya baat karte ho chacha...aurat ke karan he to..mahabharat or ramayan huwa tha...dont blme men for evry issues...
Sir Amir Khna<br>Its I thought a great programme to unfold actual thing but now this show <br><br>Why u dont ask a middle class man to say how he fight and whole life he spend to do so without any complaint <br><br>For him family and respect only he is maintaining <br><br>Please dont do everything for trp please
Kangana Ranaut so telented..
Amir khan r u like amir siddiqi i think<br>...!
Abe agr indian mans m ye qualities n hoti to india m womens ki conditn europian countries jaisi hoti aur kya tb aapko lgta ki haan india m descipline haiii .....amir sir baat ektrfa nhi krnii chahiye...!
Hello Aamir, today I saw your episode about old parents  about money. In short hame childhood se sikhaya jata hai parents are our next to god and it’s true in some cases. How about if parents are opposite of god I don’t want to use any bad words. In that case what is your opinion how you handle oh I just forgot you also left your kids and wife. Never mind
Despite of that Deepika did lovely and Raabta, parineeti did jaane man aah. Hypocrites
Onlike karne wale ki
No means no
oh no there is not  a single comment on the family go through trauma .shit to all
the family that accepts a filthy criminal like this would not be a human in humanity <br>,if this the root cause of everything then I really proud to be the supporter of feminism .
is it just me..or this entire episode is highly biased..
Deepika Padukone&#39;s must look at her statement once again ..... after this interview she has a super hit song &quot;lovely &quot;don&#39;t know why people talk such things when they can&#39;t say
Mam historical lines <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=2890">48:10</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=2900">48:20</a> 💑👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

Only for Deepika ❤
Thanku so much sir
These type of shows are must be repeat telecast on television through this critical time of Lockdown
Very stereotypical at the beginning of the show... Rest was informative and had a good outlook
😔😔😢
Guru Gobind Singh Ji, Saints, warriors, protectors, those who stand up for the weak, and those who support their families in the fight against oppression.

Real man should be honest and respect women there won’t be any conflicts.
Main 5 years bad dekhraha hu.... Ahibhi lakdkia Bollywood main bastu hai mani jati hai.....ishka matlab sayed koi bhi toll free number per call nahi kiya tha.. 💔💔💔💔
Sir plz.vapas chalu kijiye ye episodes
Kangana overshadowed other two. Sachi bharatiya nari sabpe bhari ❤️🙏
Movies hv a huge impact on the society... Songs all... Always tell ur kids it&#39;s all fake
This episode came 5 years ago and still movies like kabir singh are becoming blockbuster, thousands of people are defending this horrific movie! This saddens my heart!
Hi amir Sir plz restart your show
Ye show firse shru kro Bai... Aaj b Kai naye or purane mudde hn Jo isme show m nhi dikhate gye or wo bhot sensitive hn...
Hats off to the entire team of satyamev jayte. Not only the team but also the people who stood over there as an example to change the society. Their honesty and guts prove that they are real men. Inspired be a lot. Let everyone of us promote something that impact the society in positive ways. I support this show and also expect these type of shows in the present and near future that influence our future generations.
Irony is he had item number in his own films! Hypocrisy
Saare commnt kangana n all par...<br>Na so called patrichay par kishi ne commnt Kiya aur na kuchh...aur jaa aaj Kal dangr Kar rahe young log Hindu mushlim osh par kuchh nhi ..and ek party ke special log woman ko gaali dete rehte hai..and rape ki dhamki dete hai .agar onki party ke against bola tou.
Ye show firse ana chahiye
Jo log y show Dekh rhe h I&#39;m sure vo  esa nhi krte h because itne thjib bhre sbd  insanity k liy vo to bikul nhi sun skte Jo society me violence felate h.
Dunia me bahut Jhol hi.
I feel sorry for those families.<br>It&#39;s really shameful how men behaves with women in India. <br>Big respect for the old lady <br>Big respect for those men who respect thier wives and help them with thier career without any shame<br>For does Bollywood actresses you can see clearly from the way they talk that they are so fake and they will keep doing that shit but queen <br>And you can see that on her new movie
Would someone talk about the problems of those families instead of just commenting about celebrities!
NIT has a bad reputation because of such raggings.
Kas y film me bhi badlaw karna chahiy
Out of these, only kangana is real.. She doesn&#39;t say yes to item songs for money.. When she said she refused item songs, she earned respect.. While deepika and parineeti can speak whatever they want but they don&#39;t follow it actually. That&#39;s why people love kangana because she is real!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3954">1:05:54</a> most honest and true opinion given by her about our Bollywood
I m 25.. from a village area of my state. I grew up with lots of difficulties,but never touched alcohol..never did smoking..never teased any girl..never disrespected any woman. And Still virgin...<br><br>Failed miserably in love..now I ve a govt job .I m happy with my family. I m very happy with my single life ..this way I can spend my whole life..I want my family&#39;s safety and happiness ..I don&#39;t care anyone . I don&#39;t bother anyone. <br><br>I hope with these small expectations I can spend my whole life peacefully.
Bismillah. Modesty honest helpful truthful sensitive care &amp; compassion learn such qualities. Thanks
So much respect for you Aamir sir...
Aamir sir: the wrong use of rape and dowry acts, rapes of males by females,  what about toxic femininity?<br>You&#39;ve shown toxic masculinity, appreciated but show the other side too.....
Hello namaskar Sar main JK Kashyap bol raha hun Sar aapki movie Bahut Kafi movie dekh chuka hoon main bahut movie dekhi aapki Aisi koi si movie Nahin Aaegi jonsi Maine Nahin Dekhi Ho Sar mein bahut bada fan Hua aapka
Who is watching this after &quot;Chappak&quot; and knew Laxmi Agrawal through her Ted video.
India has become very corrupt society, once India was really good, but not any more. The society has become so detached and self centred.
It&#39;s feel so bad for girls being tortured...I want amir sir to start this again... I 16 year old boy want to just become a good human being and make decisions the basis of humanity...not on the basis of gender...I call myself feminist✊
Eaisa rule northeast mai nahi hota hai Ku ki miya Bibi  ak do je ka liya,hame ghina hote hai  aise  bat  sun ke
Jo hor masibat  ka samna kor  sake ohi  asli mourd hai
I think deepika,aamir and parineeti have some memory loss problem
Very good disco
Very very good Aamir Khan Shahab thank you sir
Thank you again. Aamir Khan Sir. This is a topic which most men are yearning for. Being a Male myself couldn&#39;t help resonating to what u said. In our society too such myths about &#39; masculinity&#39; exist and also highly portrayed and exaggerated in media. At the same time there hv been brave artists who hv addressed these issues but most of the time they are snubbed. It&#39;s unfortunate that there are even females who encourage these non productive behaviours of men. And the fact that alcoholism, drug abuse, rape, domestic violence,  vandalism, sexual verbal abuse, &#39;hitting on&#39; women , crime, and school fights is portrayed as &#39; masculinity&#39; by elders,teachers ( esp ones in Physical training, Discipline ) , University lecturers, Professors, Doctors, certain Sociologists, Politicians, The Forces, Religious leaders, Actors,  Authors and even some Psychiatrists and Psychologists is really pathetic. I myself had found myself getting frustrated about these myths and the indifference and apathy of people responsible regarding this. I hv been snubbed myself for genuinely expressing my opinions. And some stereotype that only men can do heavy manual work,  only men can fight, and when choosing specialties in higher studies,  Engineering, Maths, are  more masculine than Bio science or Arts. And if a guy expresses his emotions by crying or shows that he&#39;s scared what BOTH men and women would say , &quot; Oh come on... Don&#39;t be such a girl, Be a boy&quot; . So the men are denied of expressing emotions which I believe is what has increased Male suicide rates. And even in the medical field of specialties there are some , - only few thankfully - who believe that some specialties like Anaesthesia, Paediatrics, Dermatology, Haematology are &#39;women&#39;s &#39; specialties and Emergency Mx, Surgery, are  &#39;men&#39;s&#39; specialties... But I had the privilege of having a father who never raised his hand against my mother. A father who accompanied his kids without doing a job and having fun with them while the mother was at work. He showed to us that manhood was not being dominant. It was about working as a team. Standing up for each other. And Aamir Ji , as I should Address u in ur language , or in our language , Aamir Mahathmaya, ... I hv been inspired by several motivational films in ur industry portraying real manhood, Rancho in 3 idiots portrayed  its brains which is powerful than power. The brave and compassionate teacher in Taare Zameen  Par standing for Ishan a boy suffering from Dyslexia, The Sensitive yet courageous Cop in Thalaash, The gallant father Supporting his daughters in Dangal, &amp;  The role u played in Secret Superstar, are best of ur contributions in redefining manhood.  And of course Amitabh sir&#39;s role as the lawyer in Pink, is proof that a real Man respects women not harasses them. Rajkumar Rao&#39;s vulnerable role in Stree, Varun Dhawan&#39;s sensitive role in October, Arjun Kapoor&#39;s enduring role in Half girlfriend, Ranveer Singh&#39;s motivational role in Gully Boy and Vikrant Massey&#39;s supportive role in Chapaak, are some of the best performances in recent cinema by Actors of recent generation who are   definitely on the path of redifining masculinity as well. The fact that some of these movies  had ruled over certain cliched stereotypical &#39;commercial&#39;  films is a good notion for men need to properly portray themselves. And the concept of men Supporting women and breaking stereotypes is also seen in Saand Ki Aankh where a male doctor supports his two grannies to overthrow the Masculine domination in the family, by turning them into national archery champions, In   Chak De India where the  women hockey team bring international victory under the guidance of their determined Male coach,  and  In Mission Mangal where a Male  Scientist drives a team predominated by women utilizing their practical &#39; household&#39; ideas to conquer <a href="http://mars.so/">Mars.So</a> Thank you  very much Aamir sir for ur wonderful contribution towards both  men and women.
Nice kangana you are true and loyal women ,

Bilkul band hona chaey
Nora Fatehi ke bare me kya khyal h??  (item songs)
सभी परिवार ऐसे नहीं होते जैसे आप दिखा रहे हैं। वहां लड़के और लड़कियों में बराबरी रहती है। और कई जगह पर लड़कियां महिलाओं पे अत्याचार का फायदा भी उठाती हैं। <br>मेरे सामने एक एक्सीडेंट हुआ था कुछ साल पहले जिसमें एक स्कूटर पर एक परिवार जा रहा था अपने नवजात शिशु के साथ, दूसरी तरफ से एक 23-24 साल की एक लड़की गलत तरफ से चौराहा पर की स्कूटी पर। लड़की काफी तेज गाड़ी चला रही थी। एक्सिडेंट होते ही वो नवजात शिशु सड़क पर गिर पड़ा । पूरा परिवार को चोट लगी थी।<br>बच्चे को सड़क पर गिरता देख आदमी ने उस लड़की को थप्पड़ मार दिया।<br>लड़की को जैसे ही समझ आया कि उससे गलती हो गई है वो रोने लगी क्योंकि खरोच उसको भी अायी थी पर थोड़ी सी थी और गलती भी उसकी थी। भीड़ जमा हो गई और आदमी को मारने लगी, किसी का ध्यान इस तरफ नहीं था की उसका बच्चा सड़क पर गिरा था । लोग लड़की का ख्याल रखने के नाम पर उसे अलग अलग जगह पर छु कर के देख रहे थे। उस आदमी को मारते हुए पुलिस थाने ले गए। वहां पूरी बात मालूम पड़ी तो बेचारा बच पाया, किस्मत से बच्चा भी बच गया था ।<br>श्री आमिर खान जी जेंडर इक्वालिटी के नाम पर कई जगह लड़कियां भी फायदा उठाती हैं और गलत करती है जिसका खामियाजा कुछ लडको, आदमियों को भी भुगतना पड़ता है। सभी आदमी बुरे नहीं होते, आपके शो में तो ये दिखता है जैसे अगर कुछ हुआ है तो गलत आदमी ही होगा। अच्छे और बारे आदमी भी होते हैं और औरतें भी। आपसे निवेदन है की इस छुपे हुए पहलू को जिसपर कोई बात नहीं करता, आप बात करें। हो सकता है आपको ज़्यादा पब्लिसिटी ना मिले पर जेंडर इक्वालिटी ज़रूर सुधरेगी।

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3563">59:23</a> the satyamev jayte team is throwing shade soooo bad here...<br>(Edit) that was before I saw this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3702">1:01:42</a>
I&#39;m 12 and was in a co ed boarding school in semi-rural maharashtra. Kids from grade 5 to 12 were in attendance. I was in the girls hostel, and all the girls in the 10th, 11th, 12th and 9th grades used to have all these stories when some guy in their class was being an egotistical dumbass who, in a bid to impress his friends would try to ask them out or something and whenever they said no the douche would get angry and start making empty threats. Nobody could physically harm them because it was a very strict environment, but it still was disgusting. Ragging was also common practice, and some of the teachers would even promote it!The movies they showed us on Sundays for &quot; fun &quot; were always dubbed south indian movies were things like violence, ragging and sexual harassment were glorifiedThe very first holiday when I returned home i informed my mother and she took me out of the school. Hope that platforms like this enable influencers to call out such things.
Also women are largely to be blamed for men turning out to be toxic. A guy is most attached to his mother. If she can&#39;t teach him better then don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone else to be blamed. Also most guys have sister/s. They can school him as well.
Aren&#39;t the actress who sign up for such movies and roles also to be held responsible?
Hats off u Deepika <br>Apne dhyaan rkha <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23chhapak">#chhapak</a>
Kangana first said no means no...
I guess Deepika done her song lovely after this show!!
Humary haan tu Kahty hain “ aurat ho k Maar kyun khaye mard ho k mary kyun”
No
Media will not demand to start this type of show instead of demanding shit like big boss.
Instead of showing Kapil Sharma show and savdhan india on repeat mode all day; satyamev jayate should be shown. This is the least Indian channels can do for us!!
Amir khan ko India mai rehene se darr Lagta hai,,,,jay hind
Out of all three actresses kangna truly meant what she said because Deepika ended up doing item song in happy new year movie and parineeti in jaaneman as song
Good
Yeh kaun h, who disliked this video...😤😤
Haram khor amir tum hi logon ne cinema khraab Kiya h kutte,pk Jesi film se hindus ko hurt Kiya ,chutiya

Please never throw water on acidic reaction. The reaction of Water  with strong Acid is exothermic, which generates lots of heat and may lead to boiling .<br>Adding water to acid doubles its reaction.
Sub ne achi batian ki but 💯 % sachi batain kamla g ne he kahe hen
Kudos to deepika she is working as she said
Am i the only 1 who cried????
Good kaya sir
Mard vo hota hai jo namardangi ka kam nhi krta H

This is my truo hero
Aamir is my favorite hero
Paeineeti and deepika ka ko kch nhi ata
Rss wale to kab se pareshan hai ....is ke but ab to log unhi movie jarur dekhte  jinme girls ko nude dikhaya jata hai ....samaj lagatar isi direction me ja raha hai jo galat hai...
speech of kangana mam very educational and acceptable. excellent behavior.
True respect for amir khan to muture actor in Bollywood
Kya baat boli hai kangana maam ne I am a big fan of fer really respect her🤗
Yes sir, absolutely right...i also think like you said
Watched this episode after watching Raging bull..
We really need this type of show
Issne ye episod me mardion ki baat karte hai bolen, hamari hi gand mar di.<br>Sala ye choti lullit wala asli madahr**d hai !
What nonsense is this? Is this episode made to bring out the real problems faced by MEN or to humiliate MEN? This show should have invited men&#39;s rights activists to discuss the problems faced by MEN like :<br>1. False cases of molestation and rape, domestic violence, sexual harassment etc.<br>2. Lack of laws to protect MEN from sexual abuse by women. <br>3. Women-centric marriage, divorce and alimony laws.<br>4. Denial of child custody to MEN in most cases. <br>5. Reservations for women in legislatures, educational institutions and public transport systems. <br>6. Schemes which benefit only women. <br>7. General mentality of society which considers violence towards MEN as acceptable.
I think Kangna mam is so good she is strate forward
Problem of inequality for women most important problem of slow legal process for crime result
This episode was so good I think everybody should take learn from this episode this is so basic and very important problem of our country
Right sir insan bahut ghir gayah
Deepika did item song after this ...so it&#39;s very clear ..paisa hi sab kuch hai inke liye
Such a meaningfull topic ...ppl only think of man in terms of men vs women ...there are other aspects as well .
One sided stroy h only ye
mujhe kahi n kahi is mardangi prove krne k pichhe unke prwarish to h hi or wo prwarish unki maa dadi jada krti h jb maa hi apne bete ko ek aurat , ladki k aage mardangi dikhne ko sikhati h baat whi se suru ho jati h boys ki glti nhi h ye glti maa dadi bap inke h <br>mujhe to yhi lgta h aapko kya jrur btaye
Awesome
thanku so muchh amir for this show, u r unparellal .
I only hit like button because of Kangana . She is the only SENSIBLE women in indian flim  industry . All other just care only about their career rather than audiences!
Thank you very much Amirji<br>A great show. Thank you very much.🙏👍
Shukar hai Aamir Khan ne apni films mein toh society ko acha message dena start kar diya hai is episode ke baad.
Hum log pehle din hostel gye aur ragging karne k liye ladke aaye.... Thank God usi time (Nabha ke rehne wale) boys aaye, and they said..... Agar kisi ne kisi bhi ladke ko preshan kiya toh saalo ko nanga kar ke hostel ke bahar kar denge, upar se mere group mein bhi sabhi ladke aise the jo kuch bhi galat hone pe chup nahi rehne wala the. Hum mein se jyada Sardar the, hum sab ne bhi virodh kiya. Fir dubara na hamare sath kabhi ragging huyi aur na hi jab tak hum hostel mein rahe, kisi se ragging hone bhi nahi di. Nabha ke un 3 Sardar boys ka main aaj bhi thankful hoon.
Triveni ji jaise pta nahi kitne hi Maa Baap hain jin ko is galat pratha ki wajah se duniya mein nahi hain. Agar yeh mardangi hai toh thoo hai aisi mardaangi pe.
Us baap ke bete ko koi peet peet ke maare, aur maarne wale ko koi bole k main dekh lunga.
Well made, very good episode. Focus on South India, it is much more worse. Even the educated &amp; metro city, NRIs are on same level of these North Indian villagers
Agar bachche<br>Harishchandra..<br>Swami vivekanand..<br>Sarikhe movie dekhege to bachche bhi haishchandra aur swami vivekanand sarikhe banege.. boyege ped babul ka to aam kaha  se khane ko milega.. jaisa bachcha dekhega waisa ban jayega..  agar wahi bachcha bada hokar kisi ka balatkar kar diya.. isme us bachche se jada telivision me aane wale galat cheeje ka dosh hoga.. agar samaj ko achcha banana hai to bollywood ko badalna hoga..
Arey bhai ek desh main rehe rahe ho <br>Toh milke rahon insaniyat naam ki chiz v nhi hai us hawaon baap Or bete ko saja do... Ek baapko is tarah khone ka gaam us pita ko he pata hai...
I genuinely believe Parineeti would beat up a guy who even tries to eve tease, misbehave with her
Zra actor actress se hatkar tym mile toh yahan bhi dekhein <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wht">#wht</a> should we do these institutions#<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=1306">21:46</a>
Girls always want to be with Humour and comic
mardon ki mardaangi only unki wives k liye hoti ya gf&#39;s k liye, losers, criminals, liars, rapists, murderers, harassers, pedophiles
only kangna&#39;s compliments seem reasonable and helpful, like she was kind of speaking from her heart, other 2 girls were typical fake greedy for fame bollywood
Among three of them Kangana Ranaut is so intelligent.....Deepika remember ur lovely ho gyi song I hate ... Parineeti u r so hypocrite.....
SAME type of board written about women not there in programme................what a TRP
Seriously a bad side of india always seen....  Money money and always money is not everything im surprised that judge is asking for taking money and that father hes saying for taking revenge and that mother laughing out side the court seriously..... Really india have to be strict
Jhootha amitabh... film dekho iski kabhi khushi kabhi gam.. keh dia bs kh dia
Kyu nikal to ho fir movie
Ye jo dislike karne wale hai.... Gobar log hai gobar
Anyone noticed Lakshmi here after Chhapak trailer
Really enjoyed this episode. I think it is parents responsibility to treat their son and daughter the same way. Boys should be taught to respect their sisters and female cousins. Another thing is rewards and punishment should be the same.
Deepika evolved so much from then..., she is believing that films shows impact on people... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23chhapak">#chhapak</a>
Sar Aamir ji aapka show mujhe bahut achcha lagta hai aur bahut kuchh sikhane ko
POWER and our mentality makes us BEASTS  whether it may be women or men. Women suffers as daughter, wife, and as long as she become Mother in law she enjoys the power and becomes beast .... 😳😳😳
Who introduce RAGGING in our educational institutions???
This father and sons photo should be circulated online... need to see those bloody human
MOB LYNCHING are done by MEN and they are 🦊 WOLF 🐺 who attack in GROUPS. Right!
INDIAN POLICE 👮 shame shame
Har din Satyamev Jayate ka episode dekhna chahiye...❤️
This is absolutely awesome show . <br>Thank sir @amir Khan ji  for everything that thought us in your shows
Everybody is talking about Deepika&#39;s dance in Happy New Year.. The character demanded it moreover why isn&#39;t people focusing on the fact that Deepika&#39;s character was also inspiring apart from that item song
Everybody is appreciating kangana but can we just take a moment to appreciate that old lady ...
N even Aamir did that &quot;surraiya&quot; song with Katrina after such a long meaningful discussion..
Honestly speaking all three actresses were being real. Deepika expressed her lack of awareness about the impact of movies to real lives and that&#39;s big of her instead of pretending to be informed/aware. This rings true to me and I am sure to many people that through such shows and other content we become aware no matter how mature we are. Sadly I am seeing mostly negative comments saying how these actresses especially Deepika and Parineeti are being hypocrites but even Kangana said it herself that being against the movies that degrade women doesn&#39;t mean the realities and darkness of life shouldn&#39;t be showed. Not every item song is bad and of course a character who is a bar dancer will be showed to be dancing not doing algebra.
People be commenting on the celebs instead of the topics at hand.
Ek India ka culture mujhe sabse bekaar lagta h wo h ki Jo log bolte h ki mard ko kabhi pain nhi hota mard ko kabhi Rona nhi chahiye wo sirf ladkiyon roti h Jo weak hoti h,yehi culture ki wajah se mard me apni feeling express karna nhi aata unme kuch bhi bardasht Karne ki arre yaar hum sab human beings ye Kya Matlab h.
This show should never stopped. Aamir Khan, you&#39;re amazing
One of the epic episode 🙏🙏🙏
Kangana always makes a point and stands out... Just love her to the core😍
Hatsoff amir sir...........I want this show back..... please comeback with new seasons.....
Bollywood ke  ghatiya movie na dikhake ye show dikhana chahiye
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=68">01:08</a> parineeti and deepika did item songs after this interview. 😞
I want to meet kamla mam what she said was wonderful
Kangana is always underrated... She&#39;s the best among them all.
To learn what is Logical Fallacy,  I would recommend this! 😊
Who is watching this in 2019,like me
We want this Show Again
Plz bring this show once again in star plus.🙏This show is the need of the hour in this society now.The show at least can change the mind of the people which can&#39;t be changed by law.
My favorite bollywood actor who is always teach us something via his creativity.
a recent show named &quot;100 greatest performances of the decade&quot; filmstars like depika, raneer, alia ayushman etc talks about negative roles of filmstars which strongly influences the mass people. Most of them saying that they don&#39;t care about the negative effects towards the society instead they are greedy of doing different roles as an actor. Strange.... therefore the audiences, especially like me, are afraid of seeing a movie before knowing the mass reaction towards the movie.
महिलाएं अवसरवादी होती है और हर फैसला अपने स्वार्थ हित में लेती है।एक आदमी के अंदर स्त्री के मुकाबले अधिक नैतिकता विद्यमान होती है।  <br>जैसे हर स्त्री को अपना बेटा,भाई पति दोषी होते हुए भी निर्दोष लगता पर आदमी की नज़र में दोषी,दोषी होता है। वह पक्षपात नही करता ...…गिलीगन (साइकोलॉजिस्ट)
I hope all men are things that topic..,
Amir is the real hero and real men
This is one of my favorite show after ellen degeneres cos they all do it for people those who are really in need, I keep following all this pages <br>I wish I could contribute and work for this agendas and bring some awareness to people. <br>We are not realizing that we have brought hell in  this living world. <br>Amir Khan he is my fav. mostly because of this show.
Abe sale aamir chutiye tere is show ke baad ke movies me ke item songsdekh pehle...surariya...Thus of hindustan..kamli ho gaye...dhoom3..chutiye paise leke public ko chutiya mat bana
Yaar ye sab jhot hai..ye film industry wolon ko sirf paisa chahiye...ye aamir..amitabh...aur ye teen randiyaan..Deepika kangana aur parineeti ..sab nange nachenge 🤣😜😜😜
Literally every Hindi movie I watched in 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s had these themes: gunde lardi ko cherte hain (sometimes rape karte hain),  hero khub  fight karta hai ..... being able to fight villains off physically was like a general motif in every movie. And there we wonder where people get these ideas from? We as society should stop appreciating this in our movies.
Kangna was best than others...... love you kangna...😍
No is talking about it, but that video about cinema has Amirs song too. I loved that the most how he didn&#39;t exclude himself. <br><b>I have done it so let it be in it.</b> 👏
Look at Deepika Padukone. &quot;I uSeD To HeAr tHaT mOvIeS HaS ImPaCT On SoCIeTy&quot; Dumbass..
Itna gussa q wo bhi sirf ek lohe tin k saman k liye insaan ki jaan se badhkar saman ho gya...😡
Waiting for more season.
The most stupid response by Deepika... I never knew that filmo ka itna impact padta hai until now.... Like really Deepika. You were considered a dumb earlier but now you are a certified dumb and a bimbo....overhyped overrated....
Then I should say that the human being having penis is called as man
Ye Deepika ISS episode k baad v kitne Sare item songs ki hai... Like happy new year....
We want satyamev jayate season 4 <br>On topics like:<br>Lynching hate crimes<br>Environment<br>And so on
Iss episode KO bana na hi nahi chahihai
Very respect to kamla basin. Very intelligent and very well explained
Aamir Khan &quot; Mai bhi sensitive hu&quot;....<br>A love jihad attempt for kangna......😂😂😂😂
Budhia ko bada pata hai silajit kaa...<br>Lagta hai jawani m kafi silajit kaa asar jhela ha 😂
great insights by kangana mam!!!c seems super observant!!
And now most of the guys want to be like Kabir Singh..we never learn..
Great programme with great personality
Action Speaks Louder than Words, Most of the People Respect and fear Bad people(Most are Men, I agree)
Someone said that what a samaj it will be if there is no emotion between two people my opinion is look at us look at this generation filled with so much emotion and it is ruining us
Deepika saying no<br><b>Proceeds to do happy new year</b>
amir ne jo kaha unhone kabhi realise nehi kiya unke film bhi galtiya ki hain...uske bad amir ne aise film karhi nehi .....great sir...👏 and Kangana meri favourite hain...😘 2014 mein films maker ne kuch step nehi liya...still uske bad bhi ae sab ho raha hain...or sabse ghatiya Netflix ke shows zee 5 ke shows porn se kam nehi hain... kabhi nehi dikha maine trailer pe hi itni gandi hain...akdm bura...or logo ke comments itne bure hain actress ke liye...or bhi ghatiya...
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kgf">#KGF</a> ka scene yadd aah gaya<br>Tooli mein nahi akela maar ke aah
To parineeti &#39;janeman aah&#39; song ka kya matlab h?
I love Satyamev Jayate
I thing Aamir khan is man of honesty .  He is best.

Sir,i think flirting in these days is also a mirror of masculinity. Boys love one girl and he plays with the emotion of other girl and say its a way of happiness.i smile and fight for my self respect but now I give up, bcoz I did it for a girl status but everyone calls it bewakufi, I can&#39;t handle rejection, one sided love bla bla.somwtines I feel our society is like domuha snake 🐍
Who is powerful  suppressed weak its nothing  about male n female  its about powrr
Ye episode mardo ke upar nahi hai<br>Kamini aurto k baare me episode nikalo!
Kamla ji is absolutely right. misogamy does not make a manner. thinking should be good
This show is full of prejudices against men.... Don&#39;t generalise men and women..... Women to have bad qualities... Sad that feminism destroyed West.... And now entered into Indian society
Pta ni ye kb khtm hoga...hamare Akash bhai aur Tabrez bhai jaise kitno ki jan jayegi😔😔😔😔🙁😟
The society which doesn&#39;t love women..Only has violence , control and ego...
Those 10 students must be happy and enjoying their life..
This show should come back.... And keep running
3rd class low hai india ka or ye india kabhi sudhar nhi sakta na aaj na 2050tak
Deepika, kangana, parineeti --<br>Jab dance numb diya jata hai to uske liye competition karte hai. Par ab show pe hain🙏🙏🙏
Please bring back this show.<br>It is eye opener and very educative for ignorant people like us who doesn&#39;t even know their society.🤧<br>Thank you Amir sir.
Deepika Padukone is silent .......
Film life di tara bnaya kro real life ta fuddu ni
Kanganna looks stunningg 😄
Alok Dixit sir... 👌🙏
Bhot strict kanoon banna chahiye ragging ke khilaaf
i think bringing amitabh is such a hypocrisy, dont they know about karan thapars experience with him and his affairs?
Mere ko amir ji ka number chahiye koi de skta h plz rply
Madharchod aamir khan jyada bolda hei...fucking programme
Kangna,Amir,Srk my fav bollywood actors coz those sens of humar always roks..<br>Great work 👍Amir khan<br>love from Gujarat ♥️
Amir return kab aayenge.. Please jaldi episode chalu kariye 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I miss this show please can we get this show back
AHEM AHEM KABIR SINGH AHEM AHEM
So so so proud of your work Amir.. This is what India had been waiting for. It is the fault of upbringing and society that portraits the qualities of man to be &quot;LIKETHIS&quot;.. Which is totally false. Just give them a chance to think by themselves without the influence of society, films and upbringing. I am happy to see many men who were proudly regretting their mistakes and now are a cause of this change in mindset. So happy for this change and mainly that they started to think truly form heart.. Thank you for showing this Amir. Much needed education to society. I am so proud that our Indian, is the cause for change of upcoming India. Liked mainly the talk with 5 men and Film industry people to show how people are affected with their words and work
The irony, bollywood fucktards talking about women safety. <br>Fuck u bitches....Amir fuck u. Making money on people&#39;s problems. Fuck u forever
Believe me these stars can do any thing for money misal ke taur pr parineeti , deepika aur kangana teeno hi item songs kr liye aur Amir khan me surraiya jaisi wahiyat gana kiya.
Deepika is totally absent
Talaq talaq  pe kya khna  h apka Mr Amir khan
Everybody has commented on films and the actresses....They are not the real heroes....and this video is only a jist of the basic incidents that should be considered very seriously....The people should change and I would want all the men to watch the video
Dislikers are not real man... hahaha
In 2019 i feel only the Kangna ranot is followed what she said in 2014. we all respects you kangna you are the actress whom  should be followed by girls and respected by  men. ☺
amitab bachan in 1984 support violence say on national tv &quot;khoon ke badle khoon&quot; kill the sikhs for indra gandhi murder.<br><br>So stay away from these fake talks amitab
Kangana this this insident also happenend with me
Ragging!! seriously!! guys get over it why do you have the need ! why can&#39;t you stop your friends! why can&#39;t syou speak up!!
sEE EVEN DOING SHOWS LIKE THESE PEOPLE TALKS ABOUT THE STARS AND THEIR STATEMENTS!! INSTEAD OF THE COMMON MAN SPEAK ABOUT CHANGING THEIR MINDS AND GET IN BETWEEN WHEN INCIDENTS LIKE THESE HAPPENS. PEOPLE ARE MORE AND MORE SELFFISH. THIS IS THE WORSE PART THAT IF IT WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS YOU WILL NOT SPEAK ABOUT. YOU SHOULD STILL SPEAK UP!!!IT IS A OLD SERIES BUT STILL THE SYSTEMS AS GONE WORSE.
M ek family ko janti hu unke ladle n ek ladki ko 9 saal tk  bevkuf bnaya shadi k name pr jb ladki n uske parents ko btaya unhone bola ki ladka h aise hi krega .....n father ek reputed bnk m manager h n sister scientist h n boy himself want to become a ias officer ......
Kangana ji salut amir ji apako bhi
Deepika sali tuney to is show k bad bhi nanga naach kiya hai..
Deepika is fucked up
We all should refuse item songs
Sbhi feminist baithi hui hai😂😂😂😂
Parineeta...then made jaboriya shading...hmmmm
this show was sooooooo good,, why did it even stop.. anyone in 2019?
Everyone is talking about kangana deepika..thats all we do..instead of talking to us..instead of men seeing  how the def of masculinity harm them;as women nothing more then u then ur respect and  self dignity...when u will talk to yourself
Abh bolo Aamirji ne Kya galat kaha jabh unhone kaha we have become Intolerant Country!<br>It&#39;s out of his and his teams research that he could conclude this.<br>I am sure he might have come across more scenarios than we can think of and could barely manage to present in the show as it would be difficult to bring it on Television for all audience.
<b>Maar de me dekha lunga</b><br>Kasam se yeh sunne k baad jo mera khoon Khaula h na me bata ni sakta
Very North Indian culture and behaviours.
I came for kangana ❤
Deepika apne statement par khari na utar payi lol<br>Vahi hain ye jo my choice jesw videos bnaye<br>Yaha to bus fake bol diya i didn&#39;t realize until now
I like very much this program. I think is not more in the air in India right? Sad. All my love from Barcelona, Spain.
I read many comments and 99% comments about film star. So sad. Every story is pathetic that who the stars come in the show and what said is insignificant.
Dislike karne wale namard h saale .....
Yes.insaniyat  badi hai ...
All comments about KANGANA😘😘😘😘😍 great job....qween
Who watch this interview for kangana in 2019......
Amitabh used to be a dishu....dishu....dishu Hero in movies, singing to heroines, etc in his young days.
Parinetee is talking like school girl and what is depika doing on this show is she a judge 😂
Kangana z d actresses who has sense in everything she does
You.chinl<br>Veri.nic
So called item songs are influenced to men and young boys Bollywood and all other wood&#39;s as this is an international problem watched by all people.<br>Men always make filthy comments and remark at women bcuz of this.
the ragging reminds of those times i wish india would draw from its rich ancient culture rather than copying people in the west
I can see the smiling faces,twinkling eyes and glowy face of these three men n there wives....happiness is radiating from inside of all...So conclusion is that,there is no loss of all the mens of this World in BREAKING STEREOTYPE.. TRADITIONAL IMAGE OF A MAN
Wow sir it&#39;s a very educative show.... I have learned a lot frm this amazing show..... N I want to mention with proud that.... In Leh Ladakh of J&amp;K.... Women are not supressed neither in history nor in present time... N I feel very fortunate to born here as a female.... Hats off  to team Satyamevjayate for wonderful episodes n  for the awareness they spread.... Love n gratitude frm Ladakh❤
The person who did that ragging I hope u r getting nightmares everyday n u r not happy in ur life....I hope when ur kids will be in the college when they get ragged u will realize what it feels like
who is here just for Kangna 👍👍
Only because me people earn millions government and private people .i am hard working
Deepika got d one ....😍
Kangana is the best,deepika you did rabta and many more...kha dhyaan diya🤣🤣🤣🤣
Are bc indian army mein sab mard hain jaake unse seekho mentally tough hona kise kehte hain
Deepika is really smart not saying a single word, aamir is forcing her but she is still quiet bc she wants movies and more fame in future. That’s what she got but no respect like kangana.
Yes sir even d devil rapist sohanlal who raped aruna after coming out of jail after 7 years got married n is having a family...how cud even any girl marry such a rapist
Buddiman hi ashili balwan
Ragging is an issue in most colleges...i dont understand the logic behind showing off your superiority this way though...
Actually real men r those who has all these qualities protector,good thinker,supportive,bla bla bla <br>But the fact is such men don&#39;t exist at all....we get tensed bcoz of them the way they comments it&#39;s heart wrenching........................ nd sensitive by God,they just hurt girls
Kangana&#39;s rangoon.. What about this
Sir please make a video for an army...
Deepika be like , i have money and i do whatever i want, but she so intolerance 😒😒😒
we want satyamev jayate back..come sooon
Anyone who has such insightful opinions on such matters knows how the world works. She can never go wrong in her life. More power to you Kangana
Kangana k paas bas dimag hai ... Parineeti or Deepika no clue what&#39;s going on.... brainless women...
Deepika is dumb
We wnt satyamevjayate 🔙
Kamla ji sub sahi kaha lekin ek baat hai.. O bhul gyi kishan only suicide karta hai. Kyuki usne already finance kara hota hai
We should bring this show back....
Indeed No changes in indian movies
Yr deepu is too sweet
Deepika Ji is wrong in the sense that women only want love, women want everything, the concept of a &quot;trophy husband&quot; is very strong within the ego of a women
Good Amir God bless u
Fake kangana over atitude hy Blady stupid girl
Agle din 10 Nov ko deepika ka item song aa gya😂😂😂😂<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT7g_9eNnYk">https://youtu.be/HT7g_9eNnYk</a>
Kangana is best
I was /am always a fan of Kangana,her thought and her intelligence.
Itni samaj seva Karni hai to free me Kar deta show
Hi, I looked for the book which kamla mam has written on masculanity. Unfortunately, i could not find it. Kindlz, sent me link if anybody knows. Thanks :)
Kangna mam is really good soul. Hats to miss kangna. She is honest, sincere and main point of kangna ji is woh  sahi ko sahi kehti hai.
No means no. So guys I humbled  request u plej give respect to girls.
I have no words for this episode....It&#39;s a wonderful
India need this show more now. Blind faith in government, fake nationalism, fight in name of religion, etc has taken over
What about their fathers and brothers don&#39;t they count as men😒<br>recently ragging started in our country school too but thanks to the social media its being stopped😡
Are kutte parents  apne bachcho ko a kya sikhate ho ak scientist ya ak achcha nagrik  bana ke dikhao

After watching this episode , i truly respect kangana she was hella fire 🔥,,,,
people have too much time for watching comedy video <br>but not time for such video shame on you <br>share this video with your family and friends <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23make">#make</a>_india_proud..
Kangana is looking so beautiful
I&#39;m agree with Kamla Bhasin
Amirji apke program me  Joni rotaho use panipilado use uska gmkmhoga
Very true men are week and emoshnailly disbalanced, and the most important thing needs to mention over here they are always searching someone whome they can put the blame.. All men are not same some of them has present very good example, count of those are very less.
Unfortunately these things are happening in many Asian countries such as Afghanistan :(
I don&#39;t understand why all the comments about actress&#39;s.their are plenty of other people who shares their life&#39;s experience then why their is no comment about them.this is high time we should stop bothering about this celebs .we have many more problems talk about them grow up.
Sorry, but I don&#39;t agree with the idea that because of masculinity, men becomes violent. Don&#39;t generalize one gender on the basis of their physiology. A man is defined by his masculinity. Without masculinity he is nothing. And don&#39;t relate masculinity with violence. It&#39;s true that men are built strong, but it doesn&#39;t mean that he always will oppress females. What defines a manly man?<br>- Showing courage in difficult situations, having confidence in himself, uplift other people from their misery, having leadership quality, loving and caring for his family, standing up against the wrong, being too strong to be gentle etc. People often misunderstand masculinity with being oppressive and violent towards others. But, it depends upon their upbringing by the parents. Women can too be oppressive towards others mentally if not physically. There are plenty of examples for that. So, rather blaming men and trying to curb down their masculinity, proper direction should be given to it. Men like Gandhi, Vivekanand, Muhammad Ali, Theodore Roosevelt, Arnold, Gautam Buddha, they are all masculine men. Masculinity is defined by quality, not only just by strength.<br>Also, when time comes violence can also be needed.<br>&quot;IT&#39;S BETTER TO BE VIOLENT THAN TO BE COWARD&quot;
Hum chahe jitna b kisi actor K fan ho jaein par kangana K liye alag hi respect hai..
Sahi baat bole amir
Dekhna hi bnd kr do esi filmein apne ap sochne par mzboor hoga bollywood nd filmmakers
Amir khan doing such great work by bringing real life stories hats off to him Excellent work done
I love listening to Kangana. One of the most sensible and realistic people of Bollywood industry. Also Enjoy listening to Vidya Balan, Rani, Sushmita Sen and Priyanka in public talks.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3085">51:25</a> she knows the future of aasifa..

Solute to Amir👍
😥😥
3rd class county’👇🏻
Only in India 🇮🇳  shame
Everyone is here talk about heroines....no body appreciate the acid survivor girl
Look at Kangana!! What brain and guts this lady possess!
Who dislike the video ..... <br>😠😠😠😠😠
4 years later Amir did a movie Thugs of hindostan having 2 item songs.<br>Bloody Hypocrite
Emotionally ladkiya buhat mazbut hoti hai, ladko se b ziyada
At the very beginning of the episode Amir asked men and women about their opinions on Men where after women denied to the adjectives given to men, Amir believed them. I wonder if the same would happen if we reverse the genders and if men would be taken this much seriously if they used such image destructing adjectives for women. <br>Secondly, they showed only those scenes or song lyrics where women were objectified and I wonder if they have really not seen movies where women played negative roles and even misused their gender for some gains ( latest RX 100 is an example that I can think of at this moment but I believe there are many ). <br>Third , those who blindly admire Kangna for being bold and intelligent ,which I don&#39;t doubt she is, and those who are saying she sticked to her words and did not do an item number afterwards, she has had many intimate scenes in her movies ( Shootout at Wadala to give an example )which also affects the audience and portray the image of the genders. So if movies are to be taken this much seriously then even Alok Nath dosent deserve to be spared.
Amir ji thank u
Indian police r the worst police in the world
Isse aage jaake celebrities khud admit karti hain they like bad boys..seedhey ladko ko boring dikhaya jaata hai..emraan hashmi ke isi style pe har movie mein usi ko heroine milti hai
deepika is brain drained
This is such a LEFTIST propaganda. Fuck this.
Wow! Kangana was just 27 at that time but seems like she&#39;s wise beyond her years. She&#39;s the only actress among the three who made the most sense and seems like she has the most knowledge about the mentality of most men who harass women on the streets.
Sunny Leony is in the film industry now ... so what actually u want to teach people ??? 😑🤔
Kangana...honest reply ..
In stories ka bahar nikalna and un maa-baap ka baat karna bhi..  Taaki log samjhe ki wo kya kar rahe hai...
Jnb apto khud itne charges leto ho ek show hosting ka
Ye Bollywood wale phir bhi nhi sudrenge
The best relatable title for this episode should be &quot;violence is harmful for everyone&quot;and &quot;consent is the most needy thing in our society &quot;
Dadi ma ne kamal ki bat khi h
Kangana is  such a nice person...wo apna strong opinions dia  iss topic par ....parinidi v thik thi..... Par deepika sirf apna sakal dikhane ae thi....
I am glad to see so many people appreciating Kangana. And for good reason. Deepika seems completely off during the whole interview and seems totally disconnected from the world she is being questioned about - the world that has helped her build her career, make her money and show off her wealth. It is quite disheartening to see people build these very public careers and only survive because of the public interest in them and act as though they have never met these very people who have followed them enough for them to have a career. Very unfortunate that celebrities still think they have landed from heaven and have nothing to do with real life challenges and reality itself.
Wow guud actor- personAAMIR KHAN,,,,,,,THANKS for gudd..gudd jobs,,,,,,,,
No one has commented about the father telling his sons story
It is such an honour to see such men who take care of their family and do not feel ashamed about what society will say.  In all woman&#39;s eyes they are still manly in fact they are true macho men.
Poori tarah se ulat pulat h soch bdlo najre bdlo bahno or bhaiiyo..<br>Sanskrati sanskaaro me pele bde log vyakti mard or aurat dono hi ek doosre ke purak hote hn .<br>Annya koi kaisa v h oo uski apni siksha or samaj ka asar v h so pls don&#39;t be insulted both man woman.<br>Jai hind
Why you talk about hindu ...Not  about muslim..In any episode
today i realised why people say india is not safe
Great topic Amir sir.and the show is great too  &#39;Satyamev jayate&#39;
Yes
Kangana  is quite intelligent lady
Im big fan of you Amir khan ..💗 <br><br>Im from Pakistan . I like your concept....
Yes plz stop showing female as an object n item. Amir loved this episode.  N sorry for those family who lost their son&#39;s.
Every here is for kangana Ranout not for chopra and padukone
when kangana deepika together, then deepika ignored infrontnof kanganaa, because she has point,  brain luks and personality.
Medically violence, aggressiveness and anger is in the genes of men....if an additional y chromosome is added to a male fetus there are many chances that he will be aggressive and criminal.....
The only quality that makes  man a man is to control his temper....
one sided and biased episode was this.<br>somebody should call Jordan Peterson or ben shapiro.
Kahan se itna chutiya mard ko leke Aya hai bencho..iq below 100 hai sabka
When masculinity harms men? Such bullshit.
Can we have this programme again
Why did he even invite deepika on the show...she seems blankkkkk like every interview
mai samajh sakta hu................ what a fucking insensitive bitch
Wait <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3570">59:30</a> ...thats  aamir
BUDDHA TEACHING IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO ALL PROBLEMS
Today to get &quot;Insaaf&quot; , one must take laws into his hands, there is no other way, courts are useless and you are just wasting your time there, the time and money spent on the court, the same time and money you can spend on gangs and buy Katta (guns) and get insaaf yourself. Thats how it should be done. Police should be killed as well, they are cowards and cant do anything, they say they are bound by law, but the truth is they are bound by their FEAR and they are scared pussies. Don&#39;t expect anything from them, they can&#39;t even kill a mosquito. Also Satyamev Jayata is a bullshit show, not showing faces, addresses and place of work of those accused in the cases but showing the innocent victims and all information about them. Fucking scumbags. Amir Khan, fake tears.
Deepika is quite most of the time
Kitni sasti hai hamare desh me jaan... Le lo  kisi ki bhi le lo.bail to mil hi jaye gi..
ganda kanun  indiaa kaa koi  sistam nai  jaan ki koi kimt nai
Let me watch this just only for Kangana Ranaut. .  I love listening to her intelligent talks..  She always talks sense..  No bakwas!!!
So now in thugs of Hindustan. You&#39;re dancing on a item number and proving yourself wrong.
Jis bike waale ne unke bête ko mara wo 100% jaati,gujjar ya thakur hoga ......inhe paison ka bohot ghmnd hota hai ......mere saamne ka case hai ek bus driver tha uski gaadi touch ho gyi thi kisi jaat ki gaadi usne use whin jaan se maar diya cylinder head pe maarkr
I hope ranveer is right guy
One of my best show I have ever seen <br>Today I have learned so much
Egoistic toh hote h
2k19❤
I miss this program satyamev jayate
Abe chutiyo itne badde show mai wo kangana ka fukaat k 2 shabd bolna acha lagga lekin kisiko wo bacha bichara, bekasoor ragging mai mara gya, wo dusra baccha jo jagde Mai mar gya, wo maa baap jo bichare pill pill karke ro rhe the , wo killers jo bina sazza payye chut gye, wo ghatiya laws, in Saab pe kisiko gussa nhi ayya, lekin wo kangana chutiya jaisi 2 shabd bolna  bhot pasand ayya, kher ladkiyo se to yehi umid hai, kuch bhi dikado apna feminism hi dekhege, kyu repeats karenge show be ache shows bhi samajdar logo k liye hone chahiye, acha hua band ho gya to.
Parineeti is the biggest hypocrite ever. She is being like I hail from a small town and used to go to school riding on a bicycle. Her classmate slammed her for lying about being poor. 🤣🤣🤣 Deepika as always doesn&#39;t know how to and what to speak 😏😏😏. Way to go Kangana 😍😍😍
bullshit.
Love you granny...... Great thoughts
Kangna maim y r verry  sensitive ..and thaink you very much aamir sir 🙏🙏

India listen here, it’s not a “punishment” if you can bail out with in two hours of the judge sentencing!
I absolutely loved the author lady...she was so smart and explained it so well.
We need more shows talking about toxic masculinity
Ohh God 😭😭😭😭😭😭

Kangana too good 😚
not a single comment about family members that has suffered...but all the comments about filmstars. .. really ???
More relevant now than ever before. Who would&#39;ve thought... 2019
I hated that guys started hooting for actresses comments and they want to change lol chutiye.
WOW bollywood change a little bit.
Why the idiot people are comparing over here  ! 90% of the people I&#39;m seeing have seen this episode to compare not to listen to their points! You should not watch this type of shows if you end up comparing
World Best Show

Only kangana 😘
Kangana!! Proud of you!!
Just we have to do one thing &#39;Nationwide ban on ALCOHOL&#39;  this will bring down 90% crime rate.
It would be more &#39;Sane&#39; to buy a boxing heavy bag, us ko ghar me taango aur us ko maaro aur badhaas poora us pe nikaalo, Bajaaye iske ki kisi &#39;saathi maanav&#39; pe nikaalo
kitnee aurtay apna life insurance apni family kay liye kerwatee hai ki uski mritu honey per uska insurance ka paisa uskay patee ko milega
Kangana is honest and a true actress and Parineeti also but Deepika has not said much about this topic so i think she is not satisfied with it
Deepika is totally  bimbo.
I always feel that this Bollywood is spoiling our society. It is the basic factor. Now they are doing drama here. I hate these people. For them money is everything nothing else. KASAM SE
One of my relative burnt his wife...now he is on bell...nd guess what...in my family except me nd my mom feels he is inocent...
Kangna is brilliant... Just loved her
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=4974">1:22:54</a> BIG B !!!!
Haryana mein kuch zyada hi gnde rules hai anpadd log hai nh bolne ki tmizz hoti aakad wahin log kre jinke pass kuch hai. Wahan k log bs paise ki aakad karte hai aur kuch nhi m shocked. Kisi aurat ko dbana agar mardangi hai toh mujhe hassi aa rhi hai aise mardo par jo aurat se daarte hai isiliye maar kr control mein rkhte hai.
Kisi k sath glt kar k guilty bhi nhi feel hota in logo ko m shocked humse toh glti se kisi kutte ko bhi thoda sa kuch lg jaye toh itna bura lgta hai. Ye sb toh phir bhi insano k sath ho raha hai......
I can&#39;t believe this for some students ragging is fun but in reality it is torture.... gvmnt should need to take some strict action nd need to stop this kind of stupid rules nd things😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Kangna ko cyco pagl confuse bolne wale khan gye ab...?? She is beauty with Brain
Wonderful  show,  i appreciate the subtitles
Deepika really did a good job. Polite, well mannered, makes her points clear, doesn&#39;t insult anyone for publicity. Class woman good job lady
En aurato ka koi baap nahi hai
Kangana is honest and real person<br>Strong enough😎😎
Parineeti did an item song with varun even after this<br>Atleast stick to your words <br>Totally fake
It&#39;s unbelievable that people live and treat each other like animals. Insaniyat hi nahi hai humhare samaj mein...jaise janwar bhi aise logon see achhe hote hai.<br><br>Rapists get married...people who throw acid gets married...who burn women get married...it&#39;s true what kind of a society or even women would allow for that to happen.<br><br>Justice is hugely missing and that&#39;s why crimes happen. If the legal system, our societies we&#39;re fair then there wouldn&#39;t be any suffering. Humanity as a whole is very cruel. It&#39;s very sad.
The best part of the video is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=2825">47:05</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuo4wbREE4U&amp;t=3365">56:05</a>
M smjta hu sb jagah nhi to km se km mere yha mahol poori yrh badal chuka h....
Indian culture is very weight that is must and possibility how can I go to up like people work somebody 24 hour work 8 years work don&#39;t come for family don&#39;t see you will buy something for baby how sorry my friend Indian culture is very wet
Dipika useless talking always senseless .
Deepika is so dumb 🤦‍♀
Ab time aagaya h. Girls ka
Why was deepika even called on the show, with intelligent women like Kangana and Parineethi ??
and there is one thing i dont understand: in this Show They are talking about serious topics and inspirational Persons like the woman, who survived the acid attack are introduced .but instead of commenting about this  , everyone is praising kangana ? Why are so many obsessed with actors??
thats the reason my Father Never let me or my siblings Watch tamil movies, because this movies conveys absolutely wrong messages about  relationship between men and women, plays down stalking and violence against women etc
One of the best episodes 👍👍👍👍
You expressions are always real.
You are very sensitive and very true<br>I respect you !
Really good and one of the best actor as well as person I saw
You are the best!
Amir sir aap ne bhut atcha kam kiya kyunki aap bhut si  galat baato ko samne liye or logo ko pata chali hamare country main kya kya galat ho rahe hai,logo ko eh sob baato ko shmjhna chahiye or logo ko sudhra jaruri hai tabhi country safe hai
Eshe glt tradition ko gvt ko dekh kar ek etchi rule banana chaiye or logo ko bhi jaha ho rahe hai crime wh rokna ya poolic ko bula lena chahiye,ab sahi bolne ki himad sabhi ko ho chahiye mainly women or girls ko
Etna acha show q bnd kiye plz start karo.fir se
What&#39;s wrong with Human race ? I hope these things have changed.

Ye family kha rhti h please btao
Satyamev Jayate - Season 3 - Episode 6 - When Masculinity Harms Men | Rajesh was an auto-rickshaw driver in Delhi. His family was preparing for Navratri celebrations in Karnal and he had promised to join them. But that day never came. He was brutally killed by a group of men.<br><br>“He was beaten up mercilessly by a group of men just because the rear of their car was nudged by his rickshaw,” says his mother, Sashi Bala. He begged those men to spare him because he had small children, but they beat him up with bricks. The men, who were drunk, also shoved his face into an overflowing drain and left him to die. In one fell swoop, the children lost their father, a wife her husband and the mother, her son. “Because of a moment of rage, our family has been destroyed,” says Sashi Bala.<br><br>Today Rajesh&#39;s wife Sageeta makes ends meet by running a stall on the street. “Those men never even gave a thought that this man might have a family—what did they lose? We lost everything,” she says. Sashi Bala wishes they would have controlled their anger, “You can pay for the damage to a car, but how do you bring a human being back to life?”

Very nice Amir sir
Me being a girl I feel that girls think  wrong  about  men
Hamare Gujrat me esa ku6 nahi hota
You great for me Aamir Khan
I love you very much Aamir Khan
It’s such a superb serial forever plzz come back
i think every single woman deserves respect more than love. because every girl is beautiful and they can be attracted or they can can be loved by any man. but i think love is something that comes through that respect. if a wife cant&#39;t cook, her husband should take it as her decision not as her weakness. i think it&#39;s a misconception that women just wants to be loved , not at all. women wants to be respected as well as loved. and the whole thing i said earlier also goes for men also. because every thing should be done from both of the sides, not from only one side whether it&#39;s man or woman. thank you.
Kangana is same then and now also... Very good... Don&#39;t change Kangana... She said &quot; no means no &quot; 2014 itself... Wow... And people say she is fake.. these people are crazy
Thank God Pakistan ka censor board bht strict h..
Matlab India mein ek hi mard nahi ha🤔<br>Inhone shadi kisse ki?🤔🤔🤔
Solute to Laxmi......
Deepika: &quot;we just want love.&quot;<br>Am also adding a new word. i.e. &quot;we jst want love nd RESPECT.&quot;💕
I only want to ask Amir sir about the item song of Katrina Kaif in the movie thugs of hindustan.
me ye 1.5k unlike dekh ke heran nahi hun ....lekin firbhi kehna chahunga ki hame sudhrna chahiye
Mard agar Bahadur Balwan aur Rakshak nahi hote toh aaj apne desh ki Raksha kaun kar raha hai?<br><br>Mard agar emotionally weak hote toh Ladkiyaan itni Rotlu kyun hai??<br><br>Mard agar Mehenti nahi hai toh aaj desh ke Itne saare ghar aur parivar kaun Chala raha hai?? Sirf Aurate??<br> <br>Kuch mard izzat nahi dete Matlab saare mard ijjat nahi dete?? LOL<br><br>Mard kabhi aurato ko Madat nahi karte?? Kahan se laya Yeh logic?? LOLOL<br><br>THIS SHOW IS TOTAL MISANDRY AND A STUPID FEMINIST PROPAGANDA <br><br>Aise hi agar koi show aurato ki kamzoriyon pe bana ke dekho.. Saare FEMINAZI ayenge attack karne..
Kangna really uttered truth......... a real lady. Aamir! 90% of the things shown in film is  not only nonsense and meaningless it has been deshaping  the brains and minds of Youths and Children. I feel sorry for the scenes shown there by those actresses and actors.
I want to meet you personally The Amir Khan Sir.<br>Please call me at this 8806752560 number.
I had faced bad comment yesterday by my student
Thugs of Hindustan - how many item songs did the movie have?
North east india one of safe place both male nd female compare to other part. Bc of tribal society. More high caste more discrimination.
pseudo feminism 53% rape cases are false...
good job sir

While show was excellent specially Bhasin mam but what Deepika said about love was totally wrong . Girls like only successful handsome and rich guys .
Deepika is Do Dumb.. Kangana Ranaut got brain. like always. to point 👏👏👏👏👏😍😍😍😍
Sir mard bole tho sri ram hai sri krishnan mhaveer swami vivekananda hai swami dayanand baghat singh mangal panday cand shekhar azad
Sir please have a comeback with a new hope for humanity in the world.
Mard bahadur nahi hote<br>may be true in case of civilians <br>what about our soldier brothers and our shaheed heroes?<br>other points its okay if ruled out..<br>but sisters.. u can&#39;t say men are not bahadur .
Ragging is such a big problem in India. Men should and can be protector&#39;s. I remember when I went to college. My friends and I were so scared to be ragged by our seniors. We were going to our classroom and we saw bunch of seniors looking at us. They looked at us and then one of the guy said &quot;Leave these girls alone&quot;. They didn&#39;t bother and went somewhere else. So, there are good guys too. So Guys, you can be a role model just like the guy who protected us.
I love it
Someone who is telling the every story seems Karan Johar
Aamir Khan, your shows are very educational.  Love it.  Keep up the good work..  Also, waiting for upcoming shows.
Kamala ji, you are fucking DOPE.
How dumb deepika looks :/
&quot;Men are protectors and maintainer of women.&quot; Al Quran
Depeka saying wrong she can talk like this because she have a lots off money each richest woman want this but not odnery woman&#39;s without money love never ever servive
It program shooted in 2014. And deepika still doing worst bakwass movies .. speaking like an intelligent lady.
All these dislikers are assholes...

Deepika sirf sunney k liye aai thi
No means no
My real hero Aamir Khan
Aamir sir u t great
I&#39;m big fan this show. Mai bhi aamir sir ke jaisa kuch aisa hi krna chahta hu aur ek acha mard bnne ki puri kosis krta hu
Who is that gorgeous?? @ 31.47 &lt;3 &lt;3&lt;3......
मर्द केवल धरती पर केवल दो है, सेर और घोड़ा <br>        मनुष केवल जुवां की मर्द है और होना चाहिए
Stronger will Dominate
May be that&#39;s why I don&#39;t like watching movies or songs. Also bcoz when I see them not as a piece of entertainment but what&#39;s actually being shown, it disturbs me. But many people around say sometimes it&#39;s alright, you should also watch. But yes I do watch Aamir sir&#39;s movies which have new perspectives of Life.
No one is saying all men are bad.. its about power.. when women get power they also behave bad... but since long bad history of world we cant deny patriarchy power.. look at the numbers.... woman have always suffered...  i know few men who are very sensitive not only towards their own family but to others as well... but those who are not need to learn...
Islam is religion closer to nature... so it introduces some rules and regulations for men women bcoz of these social issues..our prophet pbuh also make rotti with her wife hazrat ayesha....
Thats why people said negative things about islam and hijab for women and ghas e basar for men...means look below don&#39;t stair women....
It&#39;s time to start satyamev jayate again
This is one of the most sensitive and emotional episode i have seen of satyamev jayate. Seeing men and fathers cry for their son, is heart breaking. I just hate these words, &quot;men don&#39;t cry.&quot; Why do people say that! Hyper masculinity harms men and women so much! Please society try to understand, men and women and all other people who identify themselves as non-binary or trans, are part of our beautiful nature. Do not harm it by forcing hyper masculinity or hyper femininity on our future kids. Make a better world.
All are not equal
@35.50 Aamir&#39;s telling how nice he is while others are pouring their hearts out... Come on man
Who is watching now at present
ek suggesion hain ki movie me sudhar aana chahiye, jo hume sikhati hain.

Love dis show
Please start again
Lol<br><br><br><br>Can you also make an episode on fake dowry cases? Fake rape case ? How men are abused everyday? <br>Pls..<br><br>This is so damn one sided .<br>.seriously.
This episode felt soo good when it was airing but now it is just cringe compilation.
i wish I was there to answer....<br>I just watched for 7 minutes then stopped seeing a stupid discussion going on.<br>ALl these ladies should been asked whether everyone of them feels the same for their own father (who is a &#39;mard&#39;).<br>Moreorver, how many times these ladies have let their own &#39;mard&#39; to help others, whenever there is a crisis. &#39;Generally&#39;, in any crisis situation, it is the aurat (mother, wife, sister, girl friend ....) who stops the mard at the first place to avoid any conflicts. Irrespective of good or bad, this is the fact.<br>In any train accidents, flood, or in case of any types of accidents, how many aurat we have seen on the spot for rescue? <br><br>They are using some exceptions as examples... They are trying to show as if every mard is bad and the world is really full such evil mards. Such a stupid philosophy. They should think of their own fathers, brothers, teacher and each and every mard who they have come accross throughout their life. Honestly speaking, I believe women create more problems for the women than men in our day to day life. God bless those thinkers....
Kangana love you 😍
Real men protect women...<br>From what? Other men. 😑<br>Maybe men should stop being the danger women need to be protected from instead
Kangana is so right about shakespeare&#39;s stories...His stories always show consequences of bad  acts
Kangana said No to item songs &amp; also to fairness cream ads...Love her
Deepika has done 2 item numbers...Kareena Priyanka...all top actresses have done it...Shame on these women!
grt show
Best show in the world
First tell karan johar to stop making films. Always show love triangle, cheating on partner as emotional feelings, affair after marriage.
Plz bring this show back<br>Amir bhai I learned a lot from ur this show
I just love kamla ji
Nd den go n watch  suraiya song...
How can these women say men are weak like srsly i agree with issue they are discussing in general <br>But wtf our army consists of men who give up their lives so they can live happily and make such bs comments
Love this show 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
PLEASE START THIS SHOW AGAIN... WANT SEASON 4
Society ke liye, apne Desh ke liye, ek Insaan hone ke naate kitni badi jimmedari hain hum me aaj heartly feel Kiya.. Thanks Satyamev Jayate
what i feel is, &quot;being is macho&quot; feeling is there in the mind of boys, we cant deny with the facts but girls are also deeply involved in ragging, and believe me its not on small scale, its on huge scale just to show that they are brave( by ragging boys and girls both).
Pls make an episode on bullying
season 4 भी चालू होना चाहिए 🙏🙏
Everyone who wrote wrong about deepika and parineeti for them i want to add that the main discussion in this interview is how masculinity has affected our society and how a mens behavior has contributed so much crime in our country which has nothing to do with the songs deepika did, that’s her profession and she has right to choose what she wants to do. We are only picking her in this whole interview and ignoring the main point of how we are supposed to raise or sons and guide them right and how our doubble standard society needs to boycott rapists, acid attacker’s, dowry seekers and should not at least marry them.
Kamala ji you are great
Harayana ke man maderchood hai <br>Hit like if you agree
This episode was aired in 2014. Thugs of Hindustan released in 2018 which has Amir Khan in it too, has 2 item songs in it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fakecelibrities">#fakecelibrities</a>

Kangana ranaut is an inspiration for many girls she says what she do shes very genuine and frank no actor /actresses can talk like her boldly
Ese intolerance ki baat aamir ney ki our desh me hangama hua.. Kisne amir ki baat samjh key hi nahi li
Delhi wale bhsdk.. aata kuch nhi ghamand aisa rehta ki PM ko bhi bula lo.. dekh lenge
i love Aamir Khan&#39;s thinking and so &quot;satyamev jayate&quot;
Amir khan is against the making of item songs. Now in nov 2018 he doing surraiya in Thugs of Hindustan.
Ms Kamala was my favorite, we need more people like her
Deepika exactly got wht she wanted in form of ranveer😜😍
Well done Amir 👍🏼
Kangana speaks perfect hindi and english at the same time. Beautifully articulated woman.
producers should bring this show again
I like satemyae jayte
If Song&#39;s Does  not have Correct word s SOoooo why these heroine&#39;s say noooo  to these Songs.... Because these heroine&#39;s want Moneyyy
I wish there will be effect of your great conversation in  People mind
Anyone in 2018? I love Kangana group discussion etiquette, she has very strong opinions to share but does not interrupt nor screams/desperate to get her points across.. excellent quality, thumbs up Kangana.. the rest were good as well..
