its real cinemA; THANKS to spielberg, nolan, villeneuve, tranatino, MANN, scosese, lucas, thx to hollywood
&quot;we&#39;re trying to prevent ww3&quot; Now that&#39;s obvious fiction.
This reminds me of project looking glass, Remote Viewing.
Robert pattinson also there
Please re-release it!
Супер ❤️
Good movie but the annoying background music is way too loud. It too hard to hear the dialogue. Your sound engineer is an idiot. Also, Nolan thinks he&#39;s being clever by playing the background music backwards. It&#39;s not clever. It&#39;s (again) annoying!
This movie was SO good. Just commenting since they’re re-releasing it
It&#39;s a really complex movie, like if a murderer wanted to kill you by stabbing a hole in the middle your throat (not across) then ripped off your balls only to put them in the hole so you choked on your nuts struggling to pull them out on the last moments of your life. Very complex right?
Lol this is when artists get a little too self involved, they produce pretentious stinkers like Tenet, the fact that Nolan didn&#39;t even bother to name the main character his just called &#39;the protagonist&#39; is just laughably self indulgent... 😅
Only 1/10 ppl understand this movie. In a way this movie failed
Christopher Nolan&#39;s Peloton Instructor sent me here and she&#39;s right. I want my time back haha
Tenet spelled backwards is Tenet. Genius 🤣
maybe a group that using the 13th and death peanalty as well as interferring in the education system .... cause its about the way of llife thats being the worst part
I thought the lrotagonist and all these time travellers would be dead to be able to go through reversing of time. In that aspect, the movie was not fulfilling. <br>I needed more than some chamber.
This movie deserved to be a huge success, sure it&#39;s not one of Nolan&#39;s best, but still my favorite film of 2020 with a wonderfully mind-bending concept and stunning filmmaking.
Didn&#39;t know Meek Mill could act lol
Friend: Don&#39;t you have an exam tomorrow?<br>Me: No, that&#39;ll happen yesterday.
It&#39;s nice to comeback to this trailer to remember just how confused yet extremely excited I got when the car crashed in reverse and it seemed entirely intentional. At the time, I would have no idea how crazy and cool the movie was.

Worst treatment of a &quot;lead&quot; ever.<br><br>Short<br>Always gets bailed out<br>Female lead gets captured and beaten<br>Female lead is more capable<br><br>Tom Cruise doesn&#39;t look like this in his films.<br><br>Some hero.<br>Tenant... he must be a renter.
dumbest movie... ever
CULT MOVIE

Actually Nolan made  fool of people by this movie...forcefully complexity included in the script and the whole movie is forcefully conveyed..time can&#39;t run in both directions in the same space simultaneously even time cant be zero so it can&#39;t be in minus..<br><br>I think it&#39;s the worst movie by Nolan.💩
I think Rob Patterson would be a great James Bond damn hes Batman 😢
They could not go to the future I have there sounds in a pot
Christopher Nolan is a terrible and boring filmmaker who makes zero sense
awful movie. probably only the screenwriters understood the movie 🤬
Abundance of evil might impress you although 😢🎉
Goransson on the soundtrack, Nolan&#39;s insistence on in-camera effects whenever possible...I loved watching this film in IMAX. Just an assault on the senses from start to finish.
Tenet was a really good movie, Christopher Nolan never disappoints, his movies are always classics, the use of time was really well done in Tenet, story was great too. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson stole the show with their performances 👏👏
Tenet deserves a re-release in theatres..
I remember when this trailer first came out and people were legitimately wondering if it was about some secret group that operated in the afterlife 😂
I’m sorry! What just happened?
Masterpiece 💪🏻👍🏻
Never try to understand this movie just feel it.
Don&#39;t try to understand it .....<br>Feel it .....❤

All climates, and i do nothing, i read so🌈 much-i know a few languages, and i know a few instruments just. I was watching this on cinema 🥲
yeah good trailer guys,unfortunately the movie is hot garbage,sorry Nolan i do appreaciate you but this was a mistake....
Best trailer for the worst movie
Decent but not great. Not sure how many more Memento / Inception / Matrix journeys Hollywood can handle. I was satisfied with the original Planet of the Apes. The sound on this film is atrocious. Academy goes to the subtitle scriptor.
.It of second every loved
This is a very bad film, but has such awesome presentation.
I&#39;m about to finally watch this joint
✬
Fun fact: if we read &#39;TENET&#39; backwards it will be pronounced as &#39;TENET&#39;
SATOR<br>AREPO<br>TENET<br>OPERA<br>ROTAS<br><br>read it from any direction, and still reads the same.
THIS MOVIE DIDN&#39;T MAKE ANY SENSE!
Worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen
This movie turned up a little too early. Amazing film couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of the screen. <br><br>For the intended audience who constitute the majority of cinephile; the movie would be considered too cerebral to comprehend....for many too, quite frankly.<br>Great film... it feels like a dream, thoughts from subconscious, dejavu and more.<br>Mr Nolan needs to explain his movie concepts to make it easier to understand.
Movie was masterpiece....<br>Trailer is amazing<br>Can&#39;t wait for the teaser 🔥
I remember seeing the trailer and being confused about what was going on. Then I was like &quot;nah, relax, it&#39;ll all make sense when I watch the movie&quot;...
&quot;All power to all the people..<br><br><br>Boom-Shaka-Laka!&quot;
I thought Intersellar was Nolan’s worst movie, I was wrong. This movie was way too complicated, was a big letdown for me as I’m a huge Nolan fan. Miss Nolan’s classics like The Prestige.

who is here after watching &#39;Oppenheimer&#39; trailer 😂
It&#39;s been almost three years now since Tenet got almost released.
This year is amazing, I hope the 2020 is also an amazing year
“Laughing or crying” I still can’t understand what happened first when I completed/started the movie
I just watched this movie backwards  for the second time tomorrow.
THE NOLAN is an art and a science itself!<br>N0L0N0l0gy
I like how they showed 2020, after saying &quot;Something worse..&quot; lol
Im still confused whether to watch the movie or no...one of the most confused comments i seen on YouTube... 🫥
10 10 10 01
Totally underrated.
let time do what time wants to do bro..
Tenet was good, but obviously not the best movie from Nolan, but this trailer.. I get goosebumps everytime in that scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=32">0:32</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=44">0:44</a>
wtf dumbster fire is this, why would nolan make a B rated move with B rated actors??
Tenet was awesome!! Cant wait to see memento ....
This movie was awesome, it made me feel better about my dog who died next week.
This movie is …………………….
This is a bad movie
Tenet needs a sequel!!!
Trailer is very intense and excellent. On the contrary, the movie is very dull and quite disappointing.
Greate movie but why the saab 9-5 ng😭😭😭
Tenet is ahead of it&#39;s time
why the trailer look so cheap tho?
Does anyone know where the term “tenet” comes from?
This and cloud atlas are top trailers last 20 years
Just watched on Netflix, can some1 explained to me why they Moved in reverse?! Please don’t answer in reverse. 🤣
You have to watch it twice anyhow to understand ... Not exactly &#39;to understand&#39; but to &#39;peep out&#39; again in time... <br><br>All will again watch this masterpiece after 10 years to learn how to make movies related to time &amp; TENET will be a masterclass  by Christopher Nolan for them.
pagak bisa purputih saya diambil

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=98">1:38</a> tagline for the movie
best movie,,,, all run back🙂🙂
Time has no meaning, everything is happening simultaneously
And here it is .... the worst movie of the last 10 years! <br><br>Some famous names in the cast but the &quot;story&quot; is so terribly bad I could only watch completely flabbergasted. Is there anyone on earth able to summarize what happens???
it is interesting. Even if they show the whole movie in the trailer, no one will be spoiled. It is super complicated.😄👋
This movie predicted both masking <i>and</i> Ukraine.
One of Nolan’s weakest works ngl
everything is inception
the movie that killed warner media and forced a t and t to merge wb with discovery
The TENET of the animal kingdom... @
The &quot;Final Trailer&quot; is really bad, I think it should be removed. This one does the job for me.
This man, made movie on YT His name is Leo, Di Caprio, Leonardo! it is the best what you did about explaining of Ocean and our Lungs, they are afraid of thruth!
A little spoiler; Nolan is going to retire after his last movie FOLLOWING!
This movie is very intelligent and creative - one of the best time travel movies ever made.
👍🏻
half the comments are bots
；；；；
Robert &amp; John are two of AM&#39;s sons
What a waste of time. Speaking of time, this has got to be the worst time travel film I&#39;ve ever seen. It made absolutely no sense and just when you think its starting to...
The fact that this trailer came out days before 2020. 😨
The highest point in the trailer: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=43">0:43</a>
This movie is far too difficult to understand. For me it was tiring to watch and not much fun trying to understand the complex plot. Not recommended
Finished watching this movie for 25th time 😂

Do you guys realize the word &quot;Tenet&quot; is a palindrome? It reads the same forward or backward.
ROBERT PATTINSON 🖤
i was a physics proffesor at harvard, after watching this movie im a youtuber
Who all came here after Russia declared war against ukraine
Today is the day Tenet should have been released: 22/02/2022
.gnizama gnikcuf si eivom sihT
i forgot about this movie
Que pena que esta película se haya estrenado durante la pandemia, me hubiera gustado verla en cines
This movie SUCKS
Only this type of movie are from Christopher Nolan&#39;s.
This movie is <b>Inception</b> in reverse.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=105">1:45</a>
Maybe someday the world might appreciate this film, like the OG blade runner
To understand Tenet…one must actually watch it in reverse. It all becomes clear.
Meshggah
Im conviced that the only people critisizing this movie or find it boring are the people who had no clue about the plot or what was going on,in short some are just too dumb to appreciate this masterpiece.
Anyone notice that TENET is a palindrome? Read the same forwards and backwards, just like time in this movie.
I just saw oppinhaimer<br>Can&#39;t wait for tenet
ممكن تشرفواني
Who went to see the movie because of that 747
Christopher Nolan: dont mind if i do<br>*Time exists

Came here to clean my eyes after watching the No Way Home trailer :/
I don&#39;t like this movie. It&#39;s brilliant.

This movie tried to became a &quot;masterpiece&quot; , but it failed terribly, in its own logic and plot holes. I felt like  Christopher had gone too far trying to fool people with using some jargon &quot;physics&quot; paradoxes , which doesn&#39;t even make sense to people who understands &quot;physics&quot;. It was that bad. The fast pase dramatic scenes, mumbled dialogues, and confusing characters with confusing timelines of the movie, made it almost unwatchable! Sorry Nolan, it was a &quot;Disastrous Masterpiece&quot; ✌️

&#39;
After seeing the movie, I can&#39;t wait to find out what happens in the trailer.
Meh, great action flick. Can see the 200 M spent on it. Looks gorgeous as always from Nolan (with a fantastic soundtrack) but like most comments on here. Most scenes just weren’t needed and the ones that were needed to be in felt rushed. Very messy but it’s Nolan and probably all intentional.
Good trailer !!

After maanadu trailer
One could say Robert Pattinson went from Twilight to Twilight World
Nolan: if you don&#39;t understand this movie, feel it
okay but what is worse than a nuclear holocaust tho????
Steamy stacks...?

This trailer has the best soundtrack out of all of them
in hollywood and bollywood both are always seen to be saving the world.. the biggest joke though !
Did they really tell people to go see the trailer in theaters for ‘maximum effect’ Lmao <br>Like “I’d like two tickets for the 2 minute trailer for tenet movie please”
others: TeneT<br>me: Ten-Ten
Anyone know the name of this movie?
I&#39;ve seen the movie 3 times and I still don&#39;t understand it any better
My favorite TENET trailer.
......kcufdnim a tahW
Best movie I’ve ever seen
John sounds just like his Dad, Denzel.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=97">1:37</a> the movie summarized
Hollywood inspired from Bhagavad Gita 😃<br><br>Hollywood Fan - Did you know that a Hollywood movie tenet shows the concept that everything started from the protagonist and all events lead back to the protagonist. <br><br>Krishna bhakta - whats new in that concept? Lord Krishna said in Bhagavad Gita that whole universe began from Him, and all events ultimately lead us back to Lord Krishna only.
The thumbnail really said:<br><br>T     E     N    3   _| _
This will be a cult movie in the past. Just wait a few years behind, you would&#39;ve seen for yourself.
Nolan Won the Oscars in the past, Which is yet to happen in the future!
৷ র৷৷
This film is great,waiting for his previous project Dunkirk
I can&#39;t wait for this movie!  Only a year until it opens!
Nolan and Michael caine make the perfect combo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=84">1:24</a> That shot is amazing combined with the music in this trailer. My favorite part of the movie is that fight. It&#39;s incredible.
The real trailer is backwards from the end 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
T<br>E<br>N<br>E<br>T
I wish the movie kept the dreadful tone of the trailer instead of trying to be comedic
&quot;The Protagonist&quot; - Very Original name for a lead character 🤣
Saw this in 2019. And still waiting for a tralier
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=115">1:55</a>
i need to watch this film but i am scared to look stupid
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=97">1:37</a> They had the warning since the trailer... Fool of me ignoring that
I can see it is commented here, not to try to understand the movie but to feel it. <br>The beginning of the movie is more complicated (the incident at opera house). It is link with the rest of the story line only by the masked solder with red trinket.<br>The role played by the protagonist throughout the movie is also not clear as it says that he is the mastermind behind Tenet at the end.
But we change things if we do it differently What&#39;s Happened it happened which is an expression of fate in mechanics of the world, what do you call it ? ℝ𝔼𝔸𝕃𝕀𝕋𝕐
I watched it tomorrow. awesome movie.
Karnataka Upendra type movie<br>If you want understand his movies<br>You want watch thrice 😂😂😂
There&#39;s no one capable to understand this by at own.
Movie was good, but the misandry levels that Nolan put in there to fit current...trends are appaling.
Me : I&#39;m watching Tenet<br>My sister : what you&#39;re watching ?
I hate tenet  reverse that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=25">0:25</a> train moving backwards.
&quot;I think this is the end of a beautiful friendship&quot;
I just watched it! I wish I could go back in time and not waste 2 1/2 hours of time on this Pointless waste of film.
Over representation of blacks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=43">0:43</a> 🔥🔥
I haven&#39;t seen it yet 🙂
is this good? I&#39;ve run out of movies to try lol
This movies dumb. So glad I didn&#39;t watch it at the theaters. Smh. Seriously , whoever came up with the storyline, just end yourself and stop writing. &quot; Laughs at you&quot;
rip sophie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=29">0:29</a>
The movie to this trailer was fantastic. Can&#39;t wait to hear Nolan announcing Tenet&#39;s cast and start of the film&#39;s production.
Who watch in this eid
Quantum Physics is easier to understand than Tenet
See the trailer in theatres for maximum effect!!!<br>That part is little dramatic!!!

If you Liked Momento ..<br>If you Enjoyed Interstellar<br>You&#39;ll LOVE &#39;TENET&#39; !!!
Is it weird that you come here to watch the trailer after watching the movie to take it all in at once?
This movie is amazing f*ck the haters
damn I’m confused even before watching the trailer !! 🤪🤪🤪 !!   do I need to watch it with English subtitles ??   I hate it when they whisper in movies !!     do I need to take a Tylenol before watching the movie ??
Tenet full movie:- https://youtu.be/uDgMKY_INOw
Damn, that&#39;s one boring as sht trailer, I can just imagine the movie.
Lot of people saying TENET is &quot;confusing&quot;.  Well, it&#39;s on HBO Max now, and I&#39;ve watched it, and it only took one viewing to convince me that people just don&#39;t pay attention during movies.  Without giving away any spoilers, I can tell you that <b>TENET</b> tells you, repeatedly, what&#39;s going on during the movie.  Where most movies would devote dialogue to the characters and their backstories and motivations and relationships with each other, TENET reserves its speaky moments for explaining things that are about to happen; and then, explaining things that <b>are</b> happening; and then, explaining things that <b>just</b> happened.  If you can&#39;t understand what&#39;s happening in TENET, that&#39;s not the movie&#39;s fault.  It did everything it could to explain it to you.  And honestly, it&#39;s not even that hard to understand.  A little technobabble here and there, and the overarching explanation that some things are just plain happening backwards.  That&#39;s really all you need to know.
this movie was among some of the worst bullshit that i have ever seen in a movie.
The most useless thing in the world- <br>TENET trailer

World War III is satans plan to take on Jesus Christ&#39;s second coming. Why do you think every nation in the world has weapons of mass destruction? satan doesn&#39;t want to destroy this earth because he&#39;s the ruler if it he wants to destroy God. However it is written Genesis 3:15

The 1998 logo appeared on the trailer before Warner Bros. stop using this logo in 26th of November 2020. The logo returns on a 2021 trailer for Tom &amp; Jerry, with the WarnerMedia&#39;s new byline.<br>Yeah, the 1998 WB Shield was iconic, and it could take some time to get used to the new WB shield. Only time will tell if Warner Bros. will use a new composition or the 1999 music for the new logo.
One of the mistake of this movie is casting the S/O Denzel Washington. He looked exactly like a costumed fish out of water
a bit confusing honestly

the movie is so bad.. so bad...
Hello guys from future.
Jobs mine<br>1 second ago<br>Interviewer: Hello guys this is Nolan the director of Tenet.<br>Nolan: You&#39;re welcome.<br>Interviewer: so what is Tenet about? <br>Nolan: yeah thank you for having me.<br>Interviewer: wait what?<br>Nolan: it&#39;s about a spy protagonist in which one is inverted and the other is not.<br>Interviewer: wait I taught I was the one who&#39;s doing the interview?<br>Nolan: Hello guys how are you. <br>interviewer:.... &quot;confused ching chong noises&quot;  <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.  (now read my comment from bottom to top in Nolan&#39;s frame. That&#39;s basically TENET)
This should&#39;ve been the one and only trailer imo, other next trailers are so bad for this movie&#39;s dark soul
3 actors from Harry Potter, 2 actors from different Batman movies, the son of Denzel Washington and the director of Inception and Interstellar. Holy fuck!
Just watched the movie, was very good in my opinion, but the ending was wrong.... you should have played the end titles in reverse.
The question is who watches the movie then comes to watch the trailer?
&quot;once you feel that heat&quot; could be a direct reference to Chris&#39;s inspiration from Heat.

There is an entire Philosophy course being taught University level with Inception as its theme. Textbook is on <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> for those who are interested. So this movie will one day have a course based on it maybe too?
I saw the movie before I came to be, but that was today, and yesterday is tomorrow, but in reverse. with two snaps and a circle twist.
here from the future... after the 5th watch, you&#39;ll still be confused.

Gained so much respect for Robert Pattinson and John Washington, to be honest, didn’t know John Washington was even denzel’s son, and only knew Robert Pattinson as the twilight actor. After watching tenet, both insanely good actors, and will look forward to pattinson’s Batman and John Washington’s future films
the most confusing movie ive ever watched
This was the most complicated movie I ever watched. Plus we couldn&#39;t hear well what they were saying because of the sound we had.

It took me so long but I just noticed that tenet backwards is tenet lmao
so in the end, no matter whatever happened happens right? just like what Neil said, &quot;What&#39;s happened, happened.&quot; It does not change anything, but it&#39;s not pointless because it happened.
The way Chris Nolan is doing movies, one day he ll bring out a mindfuck of a movie that is shown in reverse.<br><br>Maybe he will call it Memento.
Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been a year since this trailer came out

Is this movie good? I need to know so i ca use it for a party i&#39;m planning, can anybody help? Is just a bunch of 13-14 years old kids
Haven&#39;t seen the movie, came to the comments looking for some feedback on movie/trailer... honestly I&#39;m not even sure I want to get involved anymore
GEM
Why is Christopher Nolan so obsessed with time
Why is Christopher Nolans movie always switching from black bars to full screen, so irritating
What soundtrack is this?
Best movie out this year
This trailer was perfect, and then they spoiled everything in the second and final trailer :/
Watching a Christopher Nolan movie takes a special mindset: don’t watch it for complex characters development, or emotionally wrenching stories, or perfect dialogue. You watch it to have a visual and sound orgasmic experience, and this definitely delivers
After having seen the movie - Just noticed that at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=116">1:56</a> , they very carefully cut away from what&#39;s happening on the other side of the glass.
Which is the best actor for Christopher Nolan Movie.<br>A. Tom Cruise<br>B. Vin Diesel<br>C. Will Smith<br>D. Jason Statham<br>E. Brad Pitt
<b>Nolan gets inverted oscar</b><br>Anchor: Movie has not released yet
F por Tenet
Who is here watching the trailer after the movie 🙃
Denzel Washington son in the movie. Great actor!
Who wants Christopher Nolan And Tom Cruise Movie. <br>YES : Comment<br>No : Dislike
It took 20 years for him to write this film. And this is scientifically accurate as it&#39;s possible.
Another masterpiece of &#39;CRAP AMERICANA&#39; genre. &#39;A nation that lost it&#39; subgenre.
We can practically see it  from here. What ?<br><br><br><br><br>Best director<br>Best picture <br>Best film editing <br>Best original screenplay <br>Best sound mixing<br>Best original score <br>Best cinematography
What a PIECE OF SHIT! I want my money back. This is SO vacuous.
I like the title, when it is inverted, mobile upsides down, it reads the same
trailers are more fun than the actual film
Finally got a chance to watch Tenet (in iMax - yeah!). Loved it!<br>And don&#39;t understand the negative talk about how the background music overpowers dialogues etc. I missed perhaps 3 lines of dialogue, which is par for course for any Hollywood movie and way better than a Vin Diesel / Stallone / Arnie action flick.<br>Long story short - loved Tenet. <br>And yes, Inception still remains the most confusing Nolan (for me).
Best movie about time travel
Well those who haven&#39;t seen this in a theatre, my god the soundtrack is ungodly. My head is still ringing.
Low budget Trash
Me halfway through Inception: What the heck is going on<br>At the end: oh ok I get it<br>Me halfway through Tenet: What the heck is going on<br>At the end: What the heck is going on
Every time I finish a Nolan film, I&#39;m immediately anxious for his next one
Before the movie was finished i wanted to watch it again....This movie is that good honestly,  but its not for everyone.
BGM
?sdrawkcab eivom siht saW
good good
John David sounds just like his daddy
After watching it and just re watching some of the important scenes I have come to the conclusion that this is one of my favorite movies I&#39;ve seen. Yes its confusing but that makes it all the more entertaining for me and yes in some scenes it was a little hard to here what they where saying but the epic score sold it for me
good good
The movie was a good trailer this
Hannah - Arrival - Tenet - Kangaru - Jóhann Jóhannsson
I have watched this movie multiple times already. I highly recommend it as it is one of if not my most favorite movies of all time. I suggest first viewing in a movie theater if possible or have a really good stereo system for your TV
I was born on 2000 after living till 2070.
The saab!
&quot;We live in a twiligh world...&quot;<br>i theorize that Nolan put that line in the movie over and over to keep Robert Pattinson humble by reminding him that he&#39;ll always be a glittery vampire bitchboi
Watch the movie then watch the trailer.

Omg I’m have to see this 🔥🔥
good
Worst major blockbuster in recent memory
Am I the only one who noticed TENET spelled backwards is still TENET...
this movie sucked
nice idea needed a better lead actor.
The whole movie my mind hurts from trying to understand but It was worth it 😂😂😂😂😍😍😍 this movie is the best movie I’m still trying to understand the movie tho 😂😂😂😂😍
<b>they misspelled &quot;physics 101&quot; for the title of the movie</b>
Saw this movie and I LOVED IT!!!! cant wait to buy it again on dvd, LoL
Just watched it, really good but confusing...
I swear to God after watching movie to I walk backwards when I woke up
trash film
Tenet makes you forget Physics you learned backwards as the movie progress 😂.
This comment will be edited
Great to see John David Washington to get a lead role first seen him in ballers with the rock. if he will be even half as successful as Denzel hes going to be some great movies in the future
I saw the movie tomorrow and now I&#39;ll have to watch it again yesterday. Oh god! <br><br>.eceipretsaM etulosbA
Tennet movie concept is copied from Pakistani 20-years old song.<br>Here is link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU1BUg4CnFA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU1BUg4CnFA</a> <br>Time travel or time reverse concept start from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=150">2:30</a> in Pakistani song.
Is time-travel legal?
So my sister watched this trailer while high and now shes making me watch the movie
Time goes Skrrat, skidi-kat-kat..  -Big Shaq
This trailer was perfect. And then they spoiled everything with the second and third trailer :/

I liked the film. Also, nods to Nolan on the colorblind casting of John David Washington. In the film, he’s just an American, nothing more.
Haha...thanks for the comments, I&#39;m not watching it even for the love of Dimple aunty Hrithik! Enough navigating complexities in real life, why go to a movie for more ? Time is too precious to have to see the movie twice and still come away not fully knowing what it is about...LOL
this movie never happened. u went to the past and then came to the future , then went back again. so the movies never existed

A movie about things that go backwards... Can&#39;t wait not to watch it.
Well, that algoritam is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23blockchain">#blockchain</a>
I kind of understood the first half of the movie .. In the second half , my brain froze and my eyes watched .
Action 😘
I&#39;m not dropping the likes !<br>I&#39;m catching it .

This is mumbai 🕶️🤏
Nolan is a brilliant filmmaker and I admire his efforts in giving us the best cinematic experience... but he needs to make the characters relatable for me to care.
Watching trailer after the movie! <br>U know how it works.
It&#39;s like having a Plandemic but having read and watched it before it happened:<br>2010 &quot;Lock Step&quot; pgs. 17 -19: <a href="https://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf">https://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf</a><br>Oct 2019 &quot;Events 201&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLw-Q8X174">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLw-Q8X174</a>
So happy to have heard this film won 3 oscars last year
The moste piece of shit i have looked at the last years
Too boring movie.
One year anniversary for this trailer
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTlL3F8idEo">https://youtu.be/NTlL3F8idEo</a>
Now I don’t want to watch it reading the reviews. I don’t feel like being confused anymore than I have too...
I&#39;m afraid this tested my suspension of disbelief to breaking point. This will either disappear without trace or 25 years from now everyone will be saying its an underrated classic.
teacher : come on physics not that hard<br>physics: tenet,inception<br><br>dont try to understand,just feel it .
All these comments are funny AF LOL ... I was working out and saw a trailer for this movie that said &quot; Its James Bond but on Acid &quot; Now I gotta see it ...perhaps on acid
Iski maka bhosra picture ki kuch samaj Mai Nhi aaya
Dont kill people with suspension 😫😫😫 where did u get such idea🥵🥵
i have watched the trailer day after tomorrow <br>and i am watching the movie yesterday <br>i did not understand the movie day after yesterday<br>so i watched the movie tomorrow
dnatsredun ot drah os si eivom sith &lt;—me writing this also make me confused
I came to the comments section to find out what the movie was all about. Found the hilarious comments. It&#39;s like laughing beforehand hearing the jokes.
The satisfying stepson paradoxically announce because lunchroom mostly excuse until a spooky magic. stupendous, lyrical christmas
lol.First they couldn&#39;t breath the past time  air but the director for got that in the end of the movie.
This film should win an oscar...
You have to do PHD on physics if you tryna watch this movie🙂

The jokes about reverse time will start soon.
Can somebody explain me about this operation TENET?????
Took shrooms before watching, i now understand everything.
This is so unoriginal, this movie is just a remake of that movie released in 2050🙄
GH
When teacher ask which is the most trickiest thing u have ever watched<br>Me: tenet trailer
No, Tenet users; you may not cum in! :)
Great concept. Watching the movie was difficult for the first time. Will have to see it again.
I tried to watch this movie.  I couldn&#39;t sit through it. It was grim, confusing, non-linear, non-sensical, and was just overall unpleasant. The lead, John David Washington was hard to root for. (I see nothing at all special about this relatively unknown actor other than the fact that he&#39;s Denzel Washington&#39;s son)  The entire movie was just trying too hard to be clever.  I tried 2 or 3 times to watch it and always lost interest at some point.  Waste of time IMHO, and I say this as a huge Inception fan.
To understand this movie, imagine getting the vaccine to COVID-19 in November 2019.
imagine how well this movie would have done if we weren&#39;t living through a pandemic... it deserved so much more
Hi im big fan of Nolan&#39;s movie<br><br>Not sure whether you will read this or not. <br><br>Not sure whether I&#39;m correct or not. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br><br>Tenet : after John David and dimples meet at @1.50 timelapse in the movie where Pattinson debicki and washiton have became normal at this scene by the turnstile at the airport ,you show as they all three as inverted where John does the pull-ups and they three discuss about when and where sator going to trigger the algorithm. After this discussion only they get to know when and where and they can use turnstile of Ives and go back to the 14th.<br> <br>But you placed that the discussion of three about sator itself as they inverted. Where in that time they don&#39;t have turnstile at point of time. And there is no point in inverting themselves before knowing when and where sator going to detonates the algorithm. <br><br>It&#39;s all makes sense after the discussion they used Ives turnstile to go back at 14th
Just imagine if Christopher Nolan is actually inverted and came from the future where &#39;The mission of inverting world&#39;s introphy&#39; has actually happened and he thought why not make a movie on it as well, atleast these dumb peeps will have some idea why they died (not that they&#39;ll understand anything anyway) 😂
After I watched this movie I feel like Christopher Nolan is actually inverted and because he is from the future he has all these confusing/interesting stories in his mind... He is literally from another world.. Genius!
I can describe this film in only one world<br><b>MASTERPIECE</b>
Anyone seen dark??
Total crap worse film I have ever seen total garbage.
<a href="http://afdah.com/">Afdah.com</a> watch almost any movie you want for freeeeeeee
I watched movie 80 didn&#39;t understand
In the future, the surface of the earth has become uninhabitable &amp; alarmist’s travel back in time to erase the world’s population whom they hold responsible &amp; in doing so,  these idiots erase their own existence &amp; ability to play God. <br>The reasons people living in the year 2100 won’t go back , are because they still don’t know the causes, still haven’t figured out if humans can change it, still haven’t seen any prediction come true &amp; such technology wouldn’t be in the hands of intolerant psychopaths.

what a load shit that was shit movie
I am waiting for this movie to see in theatre again  on 17 july , but still from now(14Dec) 150 days are left  , you guys were lucky to be on 🔴.
I just read reviews on this movie, and about 90% of them said they had to watch the movie twice to get a grasp on it.<br>Is it worth watching? The only movies I ever had to watch twice were David Lynch movies.
சூப்பர்...
My biggest mistake was watching this movie and then reading the all the funny comments right after. Now my confused and tired headache is bulging.
Don’t try to understand it, feel it—— that’s true. That’s how we watch it

Thank God we&#39;re blessed with gravity.
205 million USD budget: People dying of hunger and poverty all around the world and Nolan spending millions destroying planes and buildings just because he doesn´t want to use toys that would probably end up doing a better job on camera. It´s a pseudo intellectual  and probably the most pretentious / show off movie of all times. Unpleasantly casted except for Robert Pattinson and Dimple Kapadia that have wonderful performances.  Good base idea/concept but badly executed. All the dialog from the first half of the movie is being rushed and squeezed so all information from the 5 years long script was there. Bad option. It sacrifices the story because of the writer’s (Nolan) ego. The number of scenes that are out of focus are huge, probably because of the wheight of the imax camera, did you really needed imax for this? I´ve watched it on imax for the first time and got out of the theather sick not just because of the out of focus scenes but for the obnoxious argument and the bad jokes. Nolan USED to be my favorite director and i still think this was one of the best movies of 2020 compared to all the bad stuff thats playing right now, but still... what the hell?! If i had 205 million you bet you would have a monster hit movie on your hands, specially if it took me 5 years writing it. And releasing the picture in the midst of corona? How stupid can that be? It didn´t even reached the break even point. Looks like big egos, small brains and mostly lack of courage in finding new talents in a world that’s filled with them are running the show down on Warner Brothers. Ridiculous, just ridiculous.
Decided I won&#39;t waste 150 minutes to watch this movie.
Hmmm maybe I&#39;ll watch this
Can anyone explain how the three Kate came?<br>1-with sator<br>2-with son<br>3-in the 10min fight scene
Guys, the movie came out ten years ago, why did they release the trailer now?

Just watched it. Had a hard time getting through it... it&#39;s full of terrible acting and preposterous (even for science fiction, which is my favorite genre) situations. Not science plausible. Poor directing. Should make a ton of money.

Movie was awesome ❤️.......now don&#39;t even dare to ask me the story 😑
worst fucking movie ever
This is the 1st time I go to the trailer after watching the Movie.
Most confusing things <br><br>1Q84 vs tenet
MY MIND IS CRYING
മലയാളികൾ ഇതുവരെ എത്തിപ്പെട്ടിട്ട്   <br>ഇല്ലാ എന്ന് തോന്നുന്നു....ആരേലും ഉണ്ടേൽ പറയണേ....
just came here to listen trailer background score that was i think absent in movie and its 🔥.<br><br>if you feel your life sucks. Just think about this that you got chance to experience Christopher Nolan movies when your alive...and even in world pandemic (thats bonus) thats enough.
good film,  but wow, complicated
Honestly, i wanted to watch this trailer today just to feel this magic again, because the whole film felt like a big trailer, like a daydream. This film is on the wonderland level of Stalker or Eraserhead. When you are in a dream, it all makes perfect sense, but try to recall the plot, or logic awoken and it all crumbles down like a house of cards. We need more of those insightful dreams and not commercialised meaningless word scribbles. Some say that dreams are meaningless, but than why so many religious texts rely on dreams and hallucinations? Best stories were written by the people who often daydreamed, so let your brain tell you more incredible stories. Dream and explore your mind, friends.
No, you are not stupid if you didn&#39;t understand a thing. Nobody did. The ones who said they understood everything didn&#39;t as well, they are that kind of people that laugh before the joke ends to look smart.
Wakanda Forever lol so sad

Doc Brown:If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you’re gonna see some serious sh*t.<br>Nolan:If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 0 miles per hour, you’re gonna see some serious sh*t.
I watched the movie tomorrow. It was the best movie ever.
This trailer is almost one year old
Tenet? Inception? Matrix? Source Code? 12 Monkeys? - THINK BIGGER!!! Find the &#39;INCANTATION&#39;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHckT8G_Mb8">https://youtu.be/tHckT8G_Mb8</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=97">1:37</a> Just watched the movie , what she said was damn right . We just can&#39;t understand the movie lmao .
Just saw the trailer, now the movie makes a lot of sense.
This is the most confusing movie I have ever seen, and I consider myself a cinephile who have seen 100s of movies and dozens of TV series. Inception doesn&#39;t hold a candle to it
Just watched the movie. Very nice. Anyway bye.. running late cause the movie about to start in 5 minutes
Most stupid and boring movie ever seen...<br>It&#39;s not always just bcoz it&#39;s of Chris Nolan&#39;s movie it&#39;s good..<br>He just pretend to make  it complicate nothing else..<br>Waste of time..
I didn&#39;t get any single scene from this trailer
OMG!! I just saw dimple kapadia
Downloaded this last month, slightly confusing, but not bad.  7/10
Perfect movie for 2020
Nolan what have you done to us? <br>Nolan- See what I did to time!!
Just saw it. This was one of the most amazing movies ever
The Me on the Future took all precautions that the present me do not get Crazy..

Marvel movies Spoilers : Stark died, Captain went to his past<br>Tenet Spoilers: Uhh...
Comments are more confusing than the Movie
Why your pictures are so dark ?
gay
These dislikes are likes from future.
സിനിമ കണ്ടിറങ്ങി കിളി പോയവർ ആരേലും ഉണ്ടോ??
Boring
Well, the blu-ray version is on the internet now. So all these comments mean you can watch the movie before it releases.
I&#39;m about to watch this!! is this good or not??
Dec. 5, 2022<br>7:00 am<br><br>Is this a deja vu Im sure i already watch this film years ago i just forgot what is it all about.

I can&#39;t stop laughing reading the comments. It&#39;s like having a vaccine before the pandemic happens.
Christopher Nolan should win the Oscar for best picture before the movie comes out
Came back to watch the trailer after seeing the movie....Now I am not sure if I have seen the Movie.....Not bad at all
By next week I&#39;ll have the tickets for the last week&#39;s show 😎
After watching the movie I&#39;m obsessed with the music and background score 😇 what an outstanding job 👏
Yes yes finally I am going to tomorrow first day first show in India at Patna Regent funn hall ..... I am so excited 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
&quot;We live in twilight world.. and there no friends at dusk.. &quot;..
Watched the movie twice in a row..saw things in the second round that i didn&#39;t the first time.. Thinking of watching it again 🤔.. Or should i watch it from the end to beginning 😂😂.. That way i will be at the beginning when it all starts..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=81">1:21</a> scene is edited out from  movie😤😤

Congratulations. This is my first movie that i need to watch backwards to understand it. Lol
Was that Dimple Kapadia? 😍
LOVED IT !
Watched the movie now seeing crazy commenters
A must watch before Covid 19<br>Merry Christmas
You played tennis 1 hour ago and you are tired now. What if you played tennis 1 hour ago because you are tired now?!
you&#39;ve all seen the movie
Fake news... Fake movies... You can&#39;t get away with this BS, Nolan!
Haven’t watched it yet but i know fckng well I will not understand wht tf is goin on bcs it’s christoper Nolan😭😭😭
Spoiler below!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>A film with music replaced by noise. Repeating, annoying, noise.
A movie about inverse entropy man this movie has some serious twisted visuals.
Who wants John to be the next black Panther??
Maza ni aaya
So I got an e-mail  after I finished my movie. It said that I am getting   &quot;Phd in physics&quot;... <br>Do anyone else got that mail?
so there will be like tenet 2 explaining it? What happened what hell people are talking about. This movie sucks, specially in the end when soldier running and running oh ok again running. Nolan : I have no idea how to end this movie, ok run.
Watched it twice wouldn&#39;t watch it anymore than twice probs get boring after that
among the cliché dialogs like &quot;we are trying to prevent world war 3&quot;, &quot;nuclear holocast? no! something worse&quot;, &quot;it ll open the right doors; some of the wrong ones too&quot;, &quot;we have to start looking at the world in a new way&quot; there is the dialog for a nolan movie &quot;don&#39;t try to understand it, feel it&quot; 🔥🔥

I really wish they used the music in this trailer in the film as well
Tiktok has been doing the reverse thingie since its beginning. Nothing new to see here. Move along. Move along.
This 2 and the half hr plus movie  to me is so complicated , <br>see trailer: 90% is forwards good<br>see movie: 70% is backwards good<br>i don&#39;t even no why...i keep backwards n forwards on my remote all the time ...until  i get what they&#39;re doing !
Good movie but John David Washington isn&#39;t actor, there is no talent in him. There is so many young actors who could be a better choice. Kenneth Branagh perfect as always.
I just watched it, i cant believe i didnt trust nolan.. I didnt expect to like this, because of the silliness of messing with time physics.. Like when they see bullet holes that hasnt happened yet, but they disappear when someone moving back in time shoots, so when did those bullet holes appear in the linear time? I thought questions like that would keep me from getting into the story.. but that line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=97">1:37</a> im sure that line is more for the audience, and if you do that you&#39;ll love this film, it is in fact a masterpiece, i cant deny.. the cinematography, the insane pace and the uncertainty of whats going to happen, it&#39;s unlike any other film that exist! Recommend 100% to anyone who has ever liked a movie before!
Christopher Nolan hates time.
This movie went on top of my head i think they should have had a warning only suitable for phd degree holders 🤣🤣🤣
Seems like a video but highly disappointed that you decided to wreck a rare Saab that only was in production for a short period of time for that one shot. Hurts my heart.
Hollywood needs someone from the Future to make this kind of movie. Try Area 51
Just saw the movie, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll watch it again yesterday
The most confusing movie EVER!
Tell me, what happen Warner bros logo?
So what the fuck is it, aliens?
🤔
My brain is melting
i think he can play Black Panther 2.0
&quot;What has happened here?&quot;<br>&quot;It is yet to happen...&quot;<br>Gave me the chills
7.8 on IMDB, reverse that and it&#39;s 8.7, <br><br>Well Played
Nolan will be the first to proudly present his movie&#39;s trailer in the theatres for maximum effect
We want Johnny Depp back
We want Johnny Depp back
I got it!! You have to watch half of the movie then pause it to get a nap. Wake up to continue watching  and die...😁😁😋😋<br>You need that eternal mind to comprehend the true meaning.... lmao
<b>THE WAIT IS OVER</b><br>It&#39;s Official now , Release Date Dec 4th in 🇮🇳.

Le interstellar : Ahh now there&#39;s a worthy competitor
no te lo pierdas esta buenisimo
Recomendado para gente con criterio formado
Anyone watch this yet?  Which was it.. &quot;Everything&#39;s &quot;rrracist!&quot; or &quot;The climate will murder you.&quot; ?
Hola don Warner, hace unos días tuve un sueño bastante raro relacionado con una película &quot;nueva&quot; de Harry Potter en la cuál se podría implementar a la nueva generación de hogwarts (o sea hijos de harry,etc)<br>La problemática se basa en el regreso de Voldemort mediante un ritual que hacen los seguidores, una vez resucitado buscan tener venganza con el hijo de Harry pero en el transcurso de la batalla sucede algo cómo tipo Happy Death Day, que se regresa al principio del día pero los personajes tienen recuerdos de la batalla y gracias a ello se preparan para el regreso de Voldemort, pasan los días y algunos empiezan a dar por vencido a Voldemort, pero no saben que los malos también tuvieron el mismo regreso al principio del día y conservan sus recuerdos de la batalla.<br><br>El sueño que tuve fue algo raro,pero ojalá me puedas leer y si se podría hacer algo con la idea-sueño que tuve estaría perfecto,un abrazo bonito día<br>Estaré al pendiente de algún mensaje
I just watched it on <a href="http://movies.joy.com/">movies.joy.com</a> I’ve been watching everything I can think of on this site 😂😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♀️
it seems like an interesting actin movie, but when they said &quot;stop world war III&quot; bamm .suspense &quot;nuclear holocaust!&quot; bamm bmm... aoo man.. could they be more lame?
imagine turning off comments like a little bitch. Fuck you Warner Bros.
Sator was very tough to defeat
bring back Johnny Depp back to fantastic beasts
At first i thought it was going to be a high violence movie like al the others until i saw the twist at the end
邪教日本人の妄想世界観の映画です。神の世界観では有りません。

I just watched this again in IMAX. Thats the only way to see this film. It is a masterpiece. I may see it again tomorrow.....so many details.
All i want to say is tenet.
Warner : Hans can&#39;t do your next Soundtrack !?<br>Nolan : Well, we have Göransson. Don&#39;t be so dramatic !<br>Warner : And how loud is the music going to be ?<br><br><br><br>Nolan : That part is, a little dramatic !
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=96">1:36</a> Nolan&#39;s instructions to Audience
Идиоты, верните Джони Дэппа!

An unnamed CIA agent, the &quot;Protagonist&quot;, participates in an undercover operation at a Kyiv opera house. He is aided by a masked soldier with a distinctive trinket, who appears to &quot;un-fire&quot; a bullet through a hostile gunman. After rescuing an exposed spy and seizing a strange artifact, the Protagonist is captured by Russian mercenaries. He endures torture via tooth pulling before consuming a cyanide pill. He awakens to learn the pill was a test of his loyalty; his team has been killed and the artifact lost.<br><br>The Protagonist learns that he is now employed by a secret organization called Tenet, whose mission involves the human race&#39;s survival. He is directed to Barbara, a scientist studying bullets with &quot;inverted&quot; entropy which allows them to move backwards through time. She believes they are manufactured in the future, and there exists a weapon that can wipe out the past.<br><br>The Protagonist traces the bullet cartridges to Mumbai-based arms dealer Priya Singh. Assisted by a local contact named Neil, he confronts Priya, who turns out to be a member of Tenet. Her cartridges were purchased and inverted by Andrei Sator, a Russian oligarch originating from Stalsk-12, a former Soviet closed city, and who can apparently communicate with the future.<br><br>The Protagonist approaches Sator&#39;s estranged wife Kat, an art appraiser who unknowingly sold Sator a forged Goyadrawing. Kat reveals that Sator uses the drawing to keep her under his control. To enlist Kat&#39;s help, the Protagonist plots to steal the drawing from Freeport, a facility within Oslo Airport. Inside Freeport, they find a machine (later referred to as &quot;Turnstile&quot;) from which two masked men emerge; the inverted one attacks the Protagonist, while Neil chases after the normal one, whom he manages to unmask. Neil prevents the Protagonist from killing the inverted man, adding that he &quot;took care&quot; of the other one. Priya explains that Turnstile is developed in the future and can invert the entropy of objects and people, and that the two masked men were the same person.<br><br>In the Amalfi Coast, believing the drawing was destroyed, Kat introduces the Protagonist to Sator, only to learn later that the drawing is still intact. The three go boating and Kat attempts to drown Sator, but the Protagonist saves him. Posing as a freelancer, he offers to help Sator retrieve a case of Plutonium-241.<br><br>￼<br><br>Sator square, providing the film title, location of the opening sequence (Kyiv Opera), and character or firm names (A. Sator; Arepo the Goya forger; and Rotas Security in Oslo Freeport)[5]<br><br>In Tallinn, the Protagonist and Neil ambush an armoured convoy and steal the &quot;Plutonium,&quot; which is actually the artifact lost in the botched Kyiv opera house siege. His escape is compromised by two vehicles driven by inverted individuals, one of which is Sator, who holds Kat hostage. The Protagonist gives Sator an empty case. Sator retreats, leaving Kat in the speeding vehicle. After saving her, the Protagonist is captured and taken to Sator&#39;s warehouse containing another Turnstile. In a confusing interrogation, an inverted Sator (who shoots Kat with an inverted round) and a normal one demand the location of the artifact, about which the Protagonist lies. Just then, a team of Tenet operatives led by Ives arrive in an ambush and comes to the Protagonist&#39;s aid while Sator escapes.<br><br>The Protagonist, Neil, Ives and his operatives take the mortally wounded Kat through Sator&#39;s Turnstile to invert her whole self, reversing the effect of the round. He returns to the ambush site and chases after Sator. His vehicle is overturned and Sator sets it on fire. He is saved by Ives&#39; team again. Neil reveals that he has secretly been a member of Tenet from the beginning. They travel back to Freeport a week earlier. There, the Protagonist fights his past self before reaching the Turnstile and un-inverts himself. Neil takes Kat through the Turnstile which un-inverts both of them.<br><br>Priya explains that the artifacts are parts of an &quot;Algorithm&quot; capable of catastrophically inverting the entire world. Future humans had been using Sator to assemble it. Priya plans for Sator to gather all nine parts of the algorithm scattered across nine different countries with nuclear weapons in one place, which he now does. Kat reveals that Sator is dying from pancreatic cancer, and they deduce he will trigger the algorithm with a dead man&#39;s switch, believing that the world should die with him. Kat believes Sator will kill himself during their vacation in Vietnam when they were last happy together. The Protagonist, Neil, Kat, and the Tenet forces invert back to that day so Kat can delay Sator&#39;s death while Tenet secures the algorithm.<br><br>Tenet tracks the assembled algorithm to Stalsk-12, located in Northern Siberia. They commence a &quot;temporal pincer movement&quot;; red team troops move forward in time, while the blue team troops move inverted. In Vietnam, Kat surreptitiously boards Sator&#39;s yacht when her earlier self goes ashore with her son. In Stalsk-12, the Protagonist and Ives are prevented from reaching the algorithm by a locked gate; an inverted masked corpse with a red trinket on its backpack springs to life, saves the Protagonist from a gunshot, and unlocks the gate. Kat, unable to let Sator die believing he succeeded, prematurely kills him just as the Protagonist and Ives secure the algorithm. Kat dives from the yacht&#39;s deck, witnessed by her earlier self.<br><br>The Protagonist, Neil, and Ives break up the algorithm&#39;s components and part ways. The Protagonist notices a red trinket on Neil&#39;s rucksack. Neil reveals that he was recruited by the Protagonist years earlier, and this mission is the end of a long friendship. In London, Priya attempts to have Kat assassinated, but is killed by the Protagonist, who has realised that he is the future mastermind behind Tenet
God I&#39;d honestly pay just to see this trailer in imax
--Очереднвя хуйня
Just watched it already, I hope no one gives any spoilers tho🥺
Wow music
“Hey dude how’s tenet going to be?<br><br>“It’s looking great!”
I used to think Nolan was a madman not using CGI<br>But now I realize: He’s a genius.
&quot;Don&#39;t try to understand it. Feel it.&quot; <br><br>This kinda sums up the movie.<br><br>I mean that in the best way possible.
Watching the trailer before the movie: Looks like a reversed action movie <br><br>During the movie: Wow this is amazing <br><br>After the movie watching the trailer again: wait hold on a fuckin second...
വല്ലതും മനസ്സിലായോ🤭 നോളന്റെ സിനിമല്ലേ, പടം കണ്ടാലും കലങ്ങാൻ കുറച്ച് സമയം എടുക്കും😂
Is this movie worth seeing? Seems like everybody is confused.
The only movie in theaters right now worth a fk 🤦🏾‍♀️
It&#39;s boxoffice is disappointing. It deserves much more. Why isn&#39;t anybody watching it.
You haven&#39;t seen this comment yet.
Hmm a list actors must be in gitmo
when tenet is release in india
I&#39;m just so surprised and proud that Robert Pattinson takes both supporting roles and main roles unlike others. Focuses more on the plot rather than glory. Being in some of the best movies I have watched recently. Wish him the best. I&#39;m slowly turning into a fan.
Seit 9 Monaten im Kino?
Instead of appreciating the movie please guys go on <a href="http://imdb.com/">imdb.com</a> and rate the movie 10/10
Me ( after watching tenet trailer) : To see what I see I need some idea of the movie<br>Nolan : All I have for you is a word &#39;TENET&#39; 🔥🔥

https://youtu.be/uLbdrP5IDpw<br>Tenet Movie Review
Great cast , great action , good concept but the story is an absolute mess
Christopher nolan is the most over rated story teller of all time... people think his films are super complex but really he&#39;s just very bad at creating and telling a story. His characters are 1 dimensional, his writing is boring and flat, and his story archs are painfully forced and plastic. His latest turd seals the deal for me- tenet... oh my fucking god, what an abysmally shallow mess. I believe his thinking went something like this- &quot;i wanna film forwards motion alongside backwards motion, that would look super sick and epic&quot;, and he forced a really REALLY boring story driven by flat characters with zero development and terrible dialogue which is drowned out by A TOTALLY EPIC SCORE around that model and ended up with tenet, a film with so many plotholes you have to just say &quot;ok, so this this is 100% just a visual spectacle, don&#39;t look any deeper than that&quot;. Reversing the temporal dimension of objects to invert their trajectory through time &quot;*sooo cooool and deeep*&quot; ... but how can he hear what he&#39;s saying if they&#39;re in different temporal direction? And how come these guys can breath inverted air sometimes? And how come the glass breaks in reverse? I guess they must have inverted the glass before this scene?? And if the glass isn&#39;t inverted the  why does it fracture in reverse? And why do inverted people repair non inverted glass but they damage non inverted people? Wait, how long have these guys been temporally inverted for to get back to the villains BEST MOMENT IN LIFE! Wouldn&#39;t these guys have all aged A LOT by now?! And how much temporally inverted air would these guys need in those canisters to go that far back!? A LOT I AM GUESSING! Unless she went from loving him to hating him in like 2 days flat... Woaaah a backwards man and a forwards man in the same shot sooo cool, tom green did it better 🙄 oh shit, you gonna make me watch this lame fight scene in reverse now? !!BWAAAAAAUUUUM!! Omg ok fine... and another one?! !!BWWAUAUAUAUUAAAM!!! Fuuucking helll make it stooooop... AGAIN!! REAALLY?!?! !!!!BAHHAHAUAUAUAUAUUAUUUM!!!! never again nolan, never again.

Don&#39;t try to understand it, feel it. That sum up Christopher Nolan.
The worst piece of shit I have ever watched in my life. Don&#39;t waste your money
TENET - AMV motivation! <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPF42kW75Aw">https://youtu.be/MPF42kW75Aw</a>
Saw it. The visuals were cool and all, but the plot was awful, terribly written. Making something complicated doesn’t make it interesting... I didn’t give a fuck about any of the characters, don’t even know their names except Neil, a supporting character.
Alfonso Cuarón my ass, Chris Nolan perfectly gave great visuals with this awesome movie
We live in a twilight world
Totally scrap, I watched the movie yesterday in the cinema, so disappointed and it was just wasting my time
Everybody gangsta till the movie starts playing backwards.
Zzzzzzzzzzz
truth in the movies
wait... he met up with Alfred?
&quot;Nuclear Holocaust.&quot;<br>&quot;No. Something worse. 2020.&quot;

The score... it&#39;s perfection. <br>goosebumps everytime at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo&amp;t=67">1:07</a> <br>The whole soundtrack fits so well for the movie!
Hiç güzeldigil çünkü şitlet var
TeneT spells the same backwards and forwards ;)
Where can we find the 6 second YouTube advertisement for Tenet?
10/10 movie
Nobody:<br><br>Half way through TENET:  “it’s rewind time”
omg omg omg i say YES
The people who are watching this trailer after watching the movie are inverted👀
All ye Harry Potter Stans, like this when you realize Cedric, Fleur and Gilderoy are all in the same movie again!
2 Hours and 30 Minutes of not knowing if this movie was going forward or backwards 🤣 (not even exaggerating lol)
<b>leuqes eht rof tiaw t&#39;nac ,leuqerp eht dehctaw tsuj</b>
Can’t wait to see the movie again for the first time
I love red room blue room moor eulb moor der evol I
The movie is awesome. Big failure is the poor choice of the actor for the main role. Washington has bad acting skills. He really tried, but just everything about him was wrong in that movie. Very poor acting in conversation scenes, he didn’t pass the character of his hero at all. Over all loved the movie, but won’t watch it again.
Washington has his dad eyes, but that&#39;s all! He has no screen presence and his expressions aren&#39;t good.<br>Heres another famous son getting ahead off the back of a famous parent.

This trailers music is giving me goosebumps as if Nolan is warning us for what&#39;s coming! T E N E T
Rick and Morty would have done it better...
Just saw it and it blew my mind a few times throughout the movie. I was so deep in thought the whole time. Some parts are confusing and will need to watch it a few more times to understand. Excellent story and visual effects. You need to see it at an IMAX theater.
Who all r come from minutes mystery 👍👇
Even in October just waiting for the movie, hence watching trailors...
Where is i can watch this movie ?
Warner bros: release tenet time: ah shit! Here we go again.
Going to see the movie today! So excited!!!
I will not watch the movie because you guys destroyed a varig 747

With the upside down cross in the movie title I wonder how much blatant, satanic Monarch programming will be in this.
Never seen the streets os Tallinn so empty...

BRUHHHHHHHHH
When I first heard the name, I thought it was a biography of David Tennant
I wish I had more thumbs because 2 isn&#39;t enough 👎🙄👎.. don&#39;t let the trailer fool you like it did me! I walked out after 2 hours

Boring trailer, is the movie any better?
Saw  IMAX. I really enjoyed at first.  Then I had some action , story-line, fatigue.   Started to fall asleep because I lost the idea of what was happening.   Wife was fatigued too,  looks like we are going to a love story next movie. :)
I went into the movie completely blind, didn&#39;t know a thing about it. I didn&#39;t watch any promotional material or look up anything. I watched it and damn, it was really good. A very creative. Interesting and beautiful movie. I really don&#39;t know how to score it or even review it. It&#39;s such a spectacle and it&#39;s stuck in my damn head. All I can hear is that ominous theme now
Family Guy Season 11 Episode 4..Tenet concept and this plane crash scene ripped off from here it seems.

If you thought this movie was good, you’re f***ing low iq
saw the movie, now i am here to watch the trailer
The music in this trailer is epic!!!
The car that flipped and got destroyed was an extremely rare SAAB 9-5ng that is obviously not in production any more. Fuck you however made the decision to trash that car! This is a big thumbs down

If you&#39;re in the comments section of this trailer looking for some kind of review or insight into what kind of movie it is or what it&#39;s really about,  don&#39;t bother. Just expect to be VERY confused by the first half of the movies. During the second half things begin to make more sense.. At the end of the movie, what ever you&#39;re still confused about, you will find answers in many videos on youtube titled &quot;TENET movie explained.&quot; Then you can formulate your own opinion on whether it&#39;s a good movie or not.
Me watching every Robert Pattinson movie on repeat
Everybody gangsta until you get shot with a reversed bullet.
Bruh I saw this and me and the boys threw coins at people.
Tenet. But no David Tennat. Missed opportunity. Looks good tho...
Reminds me of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.
<b>A black man going back in time ? Déjà Vu.</b><br><b>Like father like son.</b>
HOW ARE THESE PEOPLE WATCHING TENET BEFORE IT WAS IN THEATERS?!
Two big mistakes in this movie <br>First Choosing John David Washington (He is a good actor but not in this scale)<br>Second not working with hans zimmer

Don’t watch this scene when you’re high, trust me
Really?  Why are the movies showing or coming up soon, about a new world?  Stop already. Show something more uplifting.
Nolan movies what i know:<br>2005: batman begins<br>2008: dark knight<br>2010: inception<br>2012: dark knight rises<br>2014: interstella<br>2017: dinkirk<br>2020: tenet <br><br> What&#39;s next?
Just saw Tenet.......my cash better reverse in to my card or the movie sucked.....unless your Stephen Hawkins
how do i watch this without committing murder
Anyone know the name of this score
Mav in Top Gun: because i was inverted<br>-&gt; Mav is in the TENET organization
Is this movie good?? I’m asking myself to see it
I love that movie 5 star ⭐️ absolutely 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
But I  don’t understand!

The Audi (going backward in time) after the BMW (drives forward related to normal time) should be in <b>front</b> of the BMW: that&#39;s a bug AFAIU since the Audi is the follower (in the inverted reality)
it feels like I learn more physics from movies than school
wtf
&quot;We&#39;re trying to prevent world war 3&quot; lol okay america. Sure you are.
Matrix 2020?
Extraordinary movie. Once in a lifetime experience. Don&#39;t forget to watch on big screen whenever available in your region. You might not get it in first viewing so second viewing is recommended. Still later when you will watch on DVD, you are going to repent why didn&#39;t you watch it on big screen. It&#39;s a masterpiece cinematic experience.
My brain is currently being scrambled yet not scrambled at the same time ;)
What&#39;s the movie telling about?<br>I couldn&#39;t get it.
&quot;Don&#39;t try to understand it: feel it&quot;.<br>- That&#39;s actually a recommendation for moviegoers. :D
W.B:  can u reverse the time in a movie?<br>Nolan: yes
Lo siento, no se ingles 👁👄👁
Watched twice in IMAX , but still very confusing ..specially cant get my head around the timelines of Red team / Blue team and the timeline of Niel in the last battle.
Trailer looks good but the critic is a mess, I dont know way. Looks entertained
There&#39;s a Tenet parody on my channel. Can you come and see it?
&quot;Welcome to the after-life.&quot; SOLD. I am watching it. <br><br>I was not going to miss a Christopher Nolan movie anyway.
I haven&#39;t watched this move yet. I have to go back to yesterday to watch it again so I can understand it better.

Feels like Inception
Why everybody talking like yoda?
Absolutely fantastic movie
- yes<br>- Mr. Nolan, your movie is about the timing again?
Absolutely, hands down, the greatest cinema experience I&#39;ve ever had. The sound design, the cinematography, the story telling, the choreography. Holy damn.
Love the car chases when one is in reverse. Reverse is same speed as first gear haha.
Why they don’t talk backwards tho?🧐

Absolute rubbish
You know,.......back in the day i used to think that deja vu was the only denzel washington movie that I thought was crazy trippy but after seeing the movie for myself it turns out that tenet is his son john david&#39;s &quot;deja vu&quot; so to speak and it got me wondering if anyone else from the Washington family will get their own deja vu someday. know what i mean?
Was the sound mixing poor or was that just my theater? I still really enjoyed the movie tho.
Bring back bale  🦇
Bruhhh when they started talking about “this bullet you see right here from the future and not been fired yet” they lost my ass! Then they started having fights in reverse and normal at same time. Denzels son got duped script probably looked good on paper.
Сначала посмотрел фильм. Потом трейлер.<br>Инверсия.
Здравствуй, случайный зритель!
Вы все кто такие? Давай дозвидания!😁😉
I did NOT like this movie at all. Nothing new here. Don&#39;t waste money on this bland movie.
The dark Knight rises was the best movie of Nolan.
vasat olmuş
The trailer was a lie from what the movies about.  Which still not sure what it’s about🤷‍♀️😂disappointed.
Just went and saw this so confused 🤷‍♀️ right out of the gate.  Could not follow.  Plus all the backwards scenes🤔 At the office the next day I literally was doing everything backwards🤯😓🤣 this one should be a Comedy.  I just started laughing so backwards literally and figuratively😜
I stat moving backward after come out from Cinema... remember SOP is a lies..😶😑

She’s soooooo tall !
I’m going to watch it now
The movie is out now
Същата боза,като Генезис със Ди Каприо,но с по-калпави актьори и ефекти.
A minute and 20 seconds into the trailer. Clearly this is the most boring movie. Thank God they didn&#39;t delete movies like that we can only hope
I have watched the movie, and it has led me here. To rewatch what I already seen, to get re-excited about this movie all over again. To one day share to the world about something I only have a word for, Rona.
Just watched today. Late night screen time. No one in the cinema. This is epic and I cant breath without my inhaler. Starting of the movie at Opera house so dramatic. Good job. Great movie 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Neil character the best supporting character.
Say red river with baseball bats # ubi and weed
The best movie I have before seen. It’s so very addictive, interesting and unpredictable!
Loved this movie really fun. Seriously if you don’t understand the film the first go through you really need to stay present as you watch it. It’s really not much to understand.
