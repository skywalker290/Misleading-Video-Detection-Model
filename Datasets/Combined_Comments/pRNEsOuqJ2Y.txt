Honestly this was the phase where her attitude and over confidence started ,earlier she was humble ,sweet and all of that now in 2023 she is unbearable, she is too full of herself ,she literally thinks she is the best,no actor is better than her well which is not true , she is a very average actor but is extremely gorgeous so that&#39;s why its working for her favour . Now she is literally doing soft porn roles especially in songs and everything is wrong with her makeup now plus body is too muscular which is looking bad on her .
Katrina Kaif looking stunning 🌼🔥
She is not single that time she is meeting other people but in her head mentally she is committed to ranveer Singh 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRNEsOuqJ2Y&amp;t=625">10:25</a> she acted in kannada movie Aishwarya that’s her first movie
Queen of hearts DeepikaPadukone
Which film is she talking about that she was almost cast for and then swapped?
She is soooooo cute🥰🫠😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
YJHD fabulous soo comforting movie ❤🥰✨i really Loved it.
Which film she was talking about from which she got replaced???
Flop of this era
biggest flop actress yet time
Today flop actress
Deepika ❤️❤️❤️
There she goes again, looking away while talking with the person in front of her ...<br>I think eyes are so important when it comes to conversations... they keep people attached to what you&#39;re saying, else listeners become disinterested
Deepika has a famous little sister.
Lol my life is getting honorily dunked with oil on my head like a dulha yay good. But then also getting threatened with a desi broom on fire. Not good.
I hate this man so much !!
I&#39;m fall in love with those dimples
I can never like her. I find her quite annoying.
Her interviews as usual boring 😴
Most fake personality in the entire bollywood. 😖😖😖
Cute
Nice ❤️
In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRNEsOuqJ2Y&amp;t=625">10:25</a> deepika said that she never been in a film set before that wow! Her first movie is a Kannada movie named aishwarya . what a hypocrisy 🤦🏻🤦🏻
BLACK REALITY OF DEEPIKA PADUKONE:<br>-9 Boyfriends in past, used them for self-interest!<br>-1 Joker Husband, The Ran-Dee Couple!<br>-Karan Johar &amp; Ambani ki Chaploos<br>-Average Acting in each movie (Movie hits because of Co-Superstar &amp; Reputed Director)<br>-Does not work with Outsiders (Non-Star Kids till now)<br>-Druggie Gang ki Admin<br>-So Selfish: Removed Karishma Prakash as Manager when her name came in Drugs <br>-Friendship with Pakistani Aneel Musharat<br>-Supporting Anti National JNU movement<br>-Fake Depression<br>-Fake Feminism<br>-Supports Rahul Gandhi for PM<br>-Kept Silence over SSR Case &amp; Nepotism<br><br>Boycott Deepika Padukone, Boycott Bollywood👿👿
She has beautiful voice n clear speech. Calm n soothing
Please can anyone tell which movie they  mentioned in the interview
She is natural beauty , she has such clarity of thoughts which is rarely seen in bollywood actors
Love her
She is boring and she don’t know what to say. May be she is too emotional. But She is beautiful but 😊

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRNEsOuqJ2Y&amp;t=793">13:13</a> she&#39;s just so cute!
I really love everything about Deepika, be it looks, acting, talking style, fashion sense, interviews, her down to earth nature and most importantly the fact, that she doesn&#39;t even give a damn to her haters. I knew before that she doesn&#39;t care about hate comments or criticism, but today after watching her reaction to hate comments, I understood that😉. And I guess the main reason for her huge success is that she doesn&#39;t allow criticism to weigh her down, in fact it fuels her to work harder. This is why she&#39;s always an inspiration for everyone who loves her, and I&#39;m one of those crazy fans of her😄. Her haters are the dumbest people in the world and if I have to describe them in one word, then it would be BRAINLESS.
She speaks as of osm is her first movie before that she did movie and she shoot in London and all she is such a lier
Who is she ?
Omg I hate this guy!!!
Which is your film like your personal Deepika’s life ?
Which is your film like your personal Deepika’s life ?
Deepika best
Queen👑👑👑,Indians must be proud of this women instead of mocking and dragging her name in every situation happening in that country....
In staring which flim is deepika talking about
she is so beautiful
Here she comes <br>Depression ki dukan
Deshh drohii<br>Anti hindu I<br>She does have any gutts to go against khanss <br>Kabutriii
YJHD made me her fan. It&#39;s the best bollywood besides Chennai Express.
It is uncomfortable to see how close they are sitting to each othe.
Saroj Khan is now on fire as a man
It&#39;s a fantastic interview of her
the interviewer is a total bum does not know how to speak proper English. SEEMS LIKE AN up WALA BHAIYA  .
Hate u alot after ur visit in JNU..thoda patriotism b le aao heart me..paise hi paise bhar rkhe h...
Deepika is fully stoned&gt;
Dumb bitch, it aint candid until she admits to her drug use. Always has rehearsed and diplomatic answers, now I guess we know what helps u
she is the most boring and lacks sense of humor
@Deepika, y you didn&#39;t support the emerging star of your industry, Ssr? I used to respect you. But your silence changed your position.
To hell with Deepika! Bollywood passed away while Sushant Singh Rajput became immortal. Our hearts bleed for SSR! India lost a national treasure. A legend &amp; an exceptional human being in every single way 😢😢 Boycott Bollywood in every single way....it’s trash and not something worth aspiring to. The cover has been blown off of Bachchan’s, Kapoors,  Khans, Padukone, Shetty &amp; others in the Bollywood Cesspool. Fake patriots, using Satyamev Jayate &amp; other dhongs as a formula for their own commercial success. Shameless vultures!!! Disgraceful! Not one word for  Sushant Singh Rajput, who was viciously murdered?!!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywood">#BoycottBollywood</a>   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#Justice4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbiforssr">#CBIForSSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23globalprayers4ssr">#GlobalPrayers4SSR</a>

deepika padukone ji boliwood movie  chhodana Nahin chahiye lekin chhod Diya hummesha ke liye baad me piche se pachtaogi isi liye aapko comment Kiya he wotis lovely good deepika padukone ji 💕🌹💕
so there are people who really spend time to say shit and hate on people???. My goodness!!!, why don&#39;t they spend that time on being good? the world would a better place
she put the facts out. The media is soo confused on everything. soo annoying how they can create hate, and false news all the time
This guy is so creepy. Kudos to Deepika for tolerating
I love the way Deepika thinks. She just seems like a good human being and she has good clarity of thoughts!
So cute when she said she is shy!!....... 😍😍
I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s acceptable when deepika replied to those comments back. It&#39;s ok. But she should understand that they not at her level, and that she should never reply to those people back and give them importance when there isn&#39;t any. Shows that she is not very assured of herself if that makes sense.
She is so damn pretty
She is quite controlling and manipulative but pretends to be this shy, coy girl.  What a PR Strategy..
This interviewer is like a gossip aunty, another one of the ilk of Karan Johar
What movie is she talking about
Shee iss veryy sweet....😍💓💋
Wasn&#39;t yu in a kannada movie!??really!?
Deepika replying her trollers in a very mean way....whereas Sara Ali khan who has the most least trolls still she replies happily and calmly to them. Sara is really down to earth.
I dont know why the anchor is zooming his face while talking to her
Prakasj  Padukone is not only a great supports figure in the world but a great father also.
Ali Bhatt is good actress but I agree she really overrated mainly because of ranbir Kapoor see the insta followers I don&#39;t know why she s getting more followers than everyone ranbir fans also following her tats the reason I found it now...she Deepika and Priyanka having more followers tat we accept because they are having world level audience ....she s going to hit 50 M also soon but definitely damn sure it includes ranbir followers ......
I am very shy 🤣🤣🤣 she is very adorable nd i hate jitesh very much
She really plays the character lively n appears natural.
Best actress I have seen ever.
She is a feast to behold always.🌺
You had done a Kannada movie before Om Shanti Om deepika :P you had been on a film set
She looks like an angel.
The host is so annoying
“I had never been on a film set.” What about Aishwarya?
Shes average looking
When God packs Gal Gadot+Margot Robbie+Kate winslet+ Keira Knightley in one package. ❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRNEsOuqJ2Y&amp;t=324">5:24</a> 18th November is my birth date😁😁..it&#39;d be great if they were actually married on that day
දීපිකා💚
I don&#39;t know why I hate this person for no reason....
Y d host get into guest face n esp. to female ones as if he’s spying on deir boobs or wat ?? Very creepy intimidating look which make other person uncomfortable n puzzled 😕
seriously boring
How she is lieing??
She acted kannada movie aishwarya, before om shanti om
Y is she lying so much... Her 1st film is from South.. Kannada before coming to bollywood.. And don&#39;t respect that one. Her film career started from kannada movie Aishwarya
What about Aishwarya Kannada movie.......u simply did tht
The whole shoot had that feel
Hollywoid shenanigans....m
Fab...good peaceful state of mind....
On that ambiguous note....
Self admitted....confused frame of mind..... Moving on...
Heros calling the shots... What i have not written even truer.....i feel stupid even having to explain...how mch of it is genuinely truer... Wilting flower...
There has been some kind of a swap... That is a classic example.... Whatever happens... Happens for a reason...
She has smirk... Needless to say she is fantabulous actress... Bollywoods it girl... When she looks heavenly in the moment....in retrospect....
Deepika 💖
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRNEsOuqJ2Y&amp;t=180">3:00</a> does anyone know which film  she is talking about ?
Her first movie was aishwarya. She is saying om shanti om... why to lie
Alia is a better actress than deepika
Ranveer was called on it twice and katrina was on it twice Aswell how come they went both seasons all 3 of them?
Hate deepika she was called on it twice
Why has there not been another interview of alia for famously filmfare season 2 I swear some actors or actresses have been on there twice meaning both seasons
So what movie was that? The one who the lead actor wanted another heroïne 🥴🥴🥴
Who is here after Sham idress Fake interview 😝😂
Which film she is talking about........
She&#39;s the BEST ♥️✨🌈
Deepika was just awesome and cute,funny and full of life,enjoyed this enterview thoroughly, love you Deepika🙂🙂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRNEsOuqJ2Y&amp;t=909">15:09</a> 😂😂😂 whoaa girl!!
These 2 had side conversations and jokes going on the whole time lol
I love you mam want to meet you a big fan of you....
Which film did she miss out on and did yeh jawani instead?
I mean Deepika your eyes are very beautiful and I think you are a great actress, but it feels like you really suck at Interview because you are too serious about your life, and it always feels like you are stressed and trying to teach everybody. That&#39;s boring, because Actors need no MASK.
Which movie was Deepika really rejected and got YJHD?
Y it thinks to me that this host takes pleasure in interfering in other lives nosy about other affairs 🤨🤔
I always wonder why shradhha kapoor dont get invitation for these kind of interview. I mean, all new star came here but why not shraddha😡😡😡😡
She is a very balanced person.
She is soo cutieee💌😘
I expected her to take the mean tweets more gracefully! well....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRNEsOuqJ2Y&amp;t=56">0:56</a> lol😂😂😂😂😂
Her interviews r boring
Hi deepika ma&#39;m<br>Do u remember d heroin of kannada film named &quot;Aishwarya&quot; while answering this interview?<br>Hypocricy is d nature of mankind, so I condemn you on that..
Deepika 😊😊😊
love u deepika u are the best ever in the world....................😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Such a beautiful soul❤
i love deepika mam💞💖
Kitni cheepri hai yar ye! 😂😂😂
The interviewer sounds very immature. 🤣
Hey which film is she talking about where she was swapped? Dhoom 3?
Does anyone know which movie she is talking about in the beginning, which she never got but did yjhd instead?
Okay! TALK LIKE ABNORMAL PEOPLE 🤣😜
Such a delight to see her on an enterview! Deepika you are one of a kind! One Hell of an actor! Congrats! I love love your movies
&quot;Queen of Hearts!&quot; 😍
Which film is she exactly talking about?
Annoying
how old is this interview?
Deepika mam very proud woman because she knows that she is black karnatak woman but she is always no makeup wowwww so great mam
Harrdy Sandhu &amp; Deepika Padukone ❤
Who the hell is this idiot host.. Really disgusting..
She has such a wonderful voice.
It&#39;s Dhoom3 she is talking about
She talks properly, not too fast not too slow very well mannered disciplined person. Not like alia, a parrot or sara very reasonable
Hi Deepika <br><br>Please help me share word about beautiful amazing pride of Sikh Indian community <br><br><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/rest-in-peace-deputy-singh?fbclid=IwAR00TPrG3KDjUdkRTu7r1_136IzHbvU5iLWaYowMby-h1kXYcGdRa9RyJ7Y">https://www.gofundme.com/f/rest-in-peace-deputy-singh?fbclid=IwAR00TPrG3KDjUdkRTu7r1_136IzHbvU5iLWaYowMby-h1kXYcGdRa9RyJ7Y</a>
He only respects a few famous personalities- the host. N dat lean- creepy he is! He shud call kangana, the wndrful queen!
She is awesome.. but Hollywood wont be casting her anymore..may be because of the freaking aacent..one can go spade on spade.. but end or the day.<br>There do exists hell of discrimaination in Hollywood even racism<br>Hollywood casting director and producers really looking for actors who are majorly from Europe Eurasia or even east Asia.. they are really not looking for that indianness there in Hollywood where most of the movies is made in a different backdrop that dont require Indian actors.<br>  This is something priyanka Chopra also facing..however she made her way now.. she made a Lott of contacts.And she also have a big Hollywood project opposite to Chris Pratt
Why this interviewer leaning way front as if he ll spit in her face..
I love her face when she&#39;s listening to other people talk and waiting for them to finish, she has a smirk, her eyes have such shine and she looks absolutely heavenly in that moment!
I think she was talking about a Salman Khan film she was going to do
Deepika they can&#39;t reach u they can only use their mouth. U keep going girl u r lovely awesome n we love you... 😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘
The film she was talking about is Fast and furious 7...
I can throw up on her
Such fake smiles and laughs
She is a great personality!  But, I wonder why does she lie&#39;s so much that she was not on film set before Om Shanti om.  I am sure she has some learnings in that film too, but she doesn&#39;t want to accept.  SAD
Which film is she talking about that was offered to her n then she was swapped can someone tell me
She is here for entertainment....bt lol how boring and...😒
Which movie is she talking about which been snatched dt actor can anybody tell
Which was the movie she got expelled and then got into Jawaani Deewani?????
You are always awesome... Don&#39;t play hide and seek in the interview. I am still in the process of solving problems here.
Deepika Padukone  should really learn to be  witty while reading trolling messages...being snobbish shows that person is getting affected by it.... common every public figure should know that there&#39;ll have trollers and supporters...
Many lies are talked about by Deepika. Deepika, why are you lying too much? You don&#39;t people like liars,<br> but you often lies. Why???😔💔
Jitesh is such an idiot. I hate the host
Can someone tell me what movie is she talking about at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRNEsOuqJ2Y&amp;t=205">3:25</a>
Deepika darling how can you always fail to mention your Kannada movie ? Is it some kind of a shame to you and your now successful career? Also learn how to accept criticism in the most positive way.. your dressing sense has been super degrading these days and lastly this interview was super boring !
No experience on film set😂😂 such a lair. Her first movie was in kannada long before om shanthi om released
I love these interviews man! The host is already friends with the guests and that gives this goofy very fun vibe to them.❤  Love it.
How many years ago was this interview
Deepika is literally so Boring and sometimes rude!! 👎
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRNEsOuqJ2Y&amp;t=625">10:25</a> a slight correction that her first movie was Aishwarya in Kannada, she probably forgot her debut🤷‍♀️
Is it only me or Deepika has this mesmerising aura and her magical smile that you can just go on watching her smile forever even if she&#39;s doing nothing.
You should never lie ....U said no experience of film set....Who did Aishwarya in Kannada before Om Shanthi Om...Your 🤡??
So sweet Deepu  love you 😘
Just gonna put it out there, Deepika Padukone is the cutest ever. I&#39;m a truly proud fan. Seeing her grow all these years and owning up to things has made me love her more. I still remember saying &quot;she needs to improve her dialogue delivery&quot; after seeing Om Shanti Om. And now I&#39;m just in awe of her. I know all your fans say this but I truly do love you and respect you more. Don&#39;t ever change.
I just love her so much....i always memorize her as my goddess queen....!! Because, she is a humble sweetheart who is very talented, gorgeous, natural, kind and very much grounded. I don&#39;t know why people try to compare her with other actresses!! Because she is a woman of guts and naturalism. I mean, other actresses are great in their own way....like she&#39;s great in her own way. It&#39;ll be unfair to compare greatest monuments with each other. right? I LOVE YOU 3000 DEEPIKA MAM....You&#39;re my inspiration to be a Phoenix, who rises from ashes. I always believe only great personalities and wonderful ideals will get haters behind....to make us realize that we are STARS!! Don&#39;t get boggled mam....i hope you&#39;ll never!!
Any millionaire actor or model who claims to want to be poor and ugly is flat out lying.
faltu.. What is the use of interview if she pats herself? Why do ppl need to watch
Irritating
Ye hamesha same lagi h..in every avatar.. n bht jyada over decent n caring friendly banti h..personally Khamba h..phle ki beauties hua krti thi..juhi madhuri urmilla ravina shilpa Sonali..sab alag n sabka alag talent..offcrse sri..beautiful varieties
How beautiful she is😵❤❤
How fake!!!! She says i had never been on a set before Om shanti om..she had done a kannada movie already as a lead role and also done couple of album songs with Himesh Reshamiya.. how fake really!!🙄🙄🙄
Love u deepika.. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23inspiration">#inspiration</a>
Full fake ! Hate the way she talks. Half of the time she says  &quot;ummmmm&quot; <b>puke</b>
I think the host is most irritating thing created on the Earth
Her first film is in Kannada. She already been in film set. Here she say, Om Shanti om is first time in film set. I really like her,but she is very diplomatic in every interview.
She is the epitome of perfection 😍 😍 😍
Deepika 😍😍😍 queen of hearts ♥️♥️♥️ atleast mine ☺️
Why is she lying about ‘never been in a film set before Om Shanti Om’ , when she had already debuted in Indrajit Lankesh’s Kannada movie - ‘Aishwarya’ opposite superstar Upendra ??
Wow
Dignified Deepu
I love her so much. Not only her beauty but her whole personality is radiating. <br>It&#39;s such a joy to watch her on screen.
She has so much changed. Of course, the reason behind it is Ranveer. And, the change is really amazing.
I have a request to Every1 that don&#39;t do that Movie. I cant see you in that Avatar. Please drop that Movie. Cannot even see the trailer, so please stop that Movie. Take a new project.
Why don&#39;t you call Anushka Sharma?? We&#39;re waitingggg
Hardwork nd successs
I love deepika....
In which film before yeh jawaani hai deewani she got swapped?
Actually Deepika is  still superstar and heroine no. 1 of Bollywood <br>Anyone doubting it will pls go check Wikipedia <br>I c sum comments Alia took over her <br>So funny

Any idea from which movie she was removed?
Idr achi lag ri💖💖but iifa me 😜
She is so clever.. a cunning bitch
Deepika = life 🌏💖❤️
So Jitesh literally decided the wedding date. STRANGE. 😆
I just hate this man.... and the way he speak...🤐🤐🤐 but i love deepikaa
Please invite salman Khan
We all from middle class familys some are speaking fluently becz their mother tongue is English so don&#39;t judge people from the book cover she can speak english thats it I feel so sorry for her.
Rather she decides which actor to be taken in the film
I think Alia Bhatt is just getting unnecessary attention just because of raazi. Deepika Padukone is getting underestimated because of her. Everybody compares her with alia. It is just obnoxious and Deepika is better than alia in terms of acting like every actor nowadays says alia is the better actor . It is just so bad ...
When the hell was this shot? She&#39;s happily married and anniversary coming up!
What a glamour she is ✨
Her way of talking a kind of pointless things, dumb girl
this show is so weird
I feel this interviewer is very arrogant .... n over .... chatu kahin k tyoes
She is just amazing as alwayzz😍
Which movie she was almost offered and the hero replaced her?
DP Beautiful!!!!!
She has been so true🧡 about somethings she is a survivor like some talented actress 🙂
Everyone should know that this interview was in 2016 when Deepika wanted to take part in (Van Diesel) movie (triple x  of xander cage) before marrying her boyfriend (Ranveer singh ) .Why do you publish it now?  You must respect her marital life deepika is now stable and happy and wants to have children.She is a human being before she is an artist. You have no right to hurt her all the time.
Such a QUEEN
SHE LOOKS SO FREAKING FAKE. DAMN.
Queen of our hearts. Deepika you are the best actress I have ever seen. I am very lucky to see your movies, scenes, your airport looks. Everything is superb of yours.
Love you deepika 😘😘😘😘
Why he doesn&#39;t respect personal life of these actors.  Always insist them.

Queen of Bollywood
Iski shakl dekho vesse to bolti h kala gora kuch nahi hota fir khud kyu gori ho jaati h kaali kyu nahi rahti
Which movie was she swapped?
I have paused midway when the single and dating stuff is talked about. I see the line between personal and professional line to be blurring. Face palm.
BORING every time she answered with safe side jab question ka answer ni dena hota h to deti q hai interview kangna best hai
Deepu gives the best interview every time.U r the best everytime and everywhere!!
I love her♥♥♥
Anchor speaks like girl...who agree😂
Deepika interview is very boring that I  agree
Deepika English is unconfedencial
Is this an old interview??? She is telling single????
Saroj khan K male version h y host😝😝
Breath of fresh Air beauty!!! How? Even after so many years???? Just amazing! 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
Deepika,padoukone best best
You are boring for sure.regretting watching that interview.
Deepika ek hai,us jaisa,koi nhi <br>Deepika Vry sweet great humble <br>Lovely great great super classi,<br>Bollywood,queen
I think she is talking about sultan
She is not giving any honest answers
I was smiling and laughing throughout  the whole interview. There&#39;s a spark in her and an aura that no other actress has, I could feel her energy through a screen yaar, love her
Why every host copies Karan johar now a days
Can anybody guess which film she&#39;s talking about in the beginning?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRNEsOuqJ2Y&amp;t=927">15:27</a> Deepika just can&#39;t take criticism 😂😂<br>The Ranveer Singh effect and boring interviews are right
Again boring interview
Deepika your talking is good too.
Why can&#39;t they just speak in Hindi . They are indians and in Hindi film industry not in western film industry.
She&#39;s lieing..!!!! Her first movie was in Kannada -  &quot;Aishwarya&quot;
Deepika is just amazing 😍😍
Who is that stupid actor??? Who removed her from the movie
This guy should be a therapist.
love u dp
She is d one😍 luv her so much. Most beautiful n talented actress of bollywood. Alia is also very gd. But dipu is💯❤
She lost me when she said I had never been on a film set before!! Coz she actually made her debut in Kannada movie called  ’Aishwarya’ in a lead role!! Hmmmm..
