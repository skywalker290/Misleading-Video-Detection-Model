This gonna be sad when he quits
yagga
For the past 4 years of watching Pewds, hes becoming more mature in life and Im so happy for it ü§ó‚úåÔ∏è
Crazy times ü§£ü§£
POV: You were looking through YouTube search to see if anybody made a video on him, for leaving YouTube right before 2022.
Test
Pewdiepie: eats food<br><br>Media: &quot;He is protesting against world hunger&quot;
MR BEEEAST ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. ninja?‚Ä¶ ok
this so sad after watching his videos every week and realising that he has quit youtube
Poppy: SimplyNailogical is kids channel.<br>Me: Beeeeeeeen! Explain plz.
You shouldn&#39;t ever have to announce that you are taking a break, you should just vanish. You do you. I may have roasted you by calling you trash, but it was sarcastic gaming trolling attitude. At least you responded properly by wearing a trash bag.
PewDiePie: tiktok is stupid<br>Media: PewDiePie says he is gonna destroy tiktok<br>And makes racist jokes on tiktok&#39;s ceo
üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
Nice introüòÇ
It‚Äôs not unusual for theory‚Äôs to go around
Very good video ever YouTube
Pewdiepie 110million +395000
Over all these years, felix has seen so much of media bullshit. I feel bad for him that  people don&#39;t actually understand how great of a guy he is.

Pew news back pls
I‚Äôm big fan but omg  üò± this is sooo sad üòûüôÅüòìüò≠
That Beanie is so cute.
I love how swedish he is with accepting awards, he is so humble which you can tell because he is swedish. The most terrifying thing you can do to a swedish person is treat them differently than everyone else by praising their work. You can see how it makes them uncomfortable. I love it
Apoostrophü§£
He legitimately said apistrofy
WHERE ARE YOU NOW QUESTION MARK?<br>WHY DID YOU LEAVE NOW?
Mr Beast f-ing planted 20 mil trees and broke 13 world records,, Pewds literally had made 20 millions subs in 4 months, and the Creator of the Year goes to someone who promotes drugs.
Wow its so sad that pewdiepie quit
I like your beanie.
Legend entrance too üëçüòÇ
Noo
I don&#39;t like tana very much
This why I don&#39;t believe anything the news says about Trump.
:(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=385">6:25</a> I thought the second one said beat Edgar
Is it weird I&#39;m watching this almost a year later when this is all irrelevant?
Don‚Äôt you hate fake comments. Like, my mom quit her job and we are now living on the streets because of fake comments. We are eating dead rats because of fake comments
Piggy pies is the square
bruh this is from a while ago but when this happened my dad got upset when he thought u were leaving LMAO

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=120">2:00</a> aren&#39;t you Poppy smoria
adderall is prescription cocaine so creator of the year is a Coke head that‚Äôs real nice
Hey, Wait.  I just realized something.  Pewdie likes to talk about himself!

Pewdiepie:has hair<br>Media:Pewdiepie is making fun of people with cancer?!?!
Did I just see a galaxy fold here? HMMMMMMMMM.
I saw ur vid on kreekcraft sub thing or whatever
so if pewdiepie was hypothetically black  or any other race besides white would the media see him in a positive or negative way?
Pew news has joined the chat.

But you said your quitting?
Whaaaaaaat!
I really like how people make jokes about Markiplier being a child who laughs at his own poop jokes when Felix made a full on game about it üòÇ
Pewdiepie:drinks water<br><br>Media:he is mocking the thirsty
After watching the clip at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=768">12:48</a> <br>I think he should be in Passion gang.
News Update: Felix Kjellberg also known as ‚ÄòPewdiepie‚Äô states Youtube is closing down soon

If it‚Äôs all wrong it becomes fact
Media: Pewdiepie, the guy that makes horror game reviews is quitting.
News Media Titles: Poppy Smoria mispronounced &#39;apostrophe&#39; App-o-strof THIS MEANS SHE&#39;S QUITTING YOUTUBE?!?!?!??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=517">8:37</a> OMG Lilly Singh, the brown bisexual women who&#39;s not at all an old white guy!?!?

Pewdiepie: <b>misses uploading for a day</b><br><br>Media: he did the dance of d e a t h
Felix: im gonna take a break.<br>The Virus: FBI OPEN UP!
Smply nail lojecol is not a kids&#39;s channel

Yes im watching this in quarantine and yes I want to make my own articlebcos of the dum media.
I fucking love the irony
Pewdiepie why :(
Bring back pew news
People need to realize pewdiepie is given his money basically by the people so if someone has a problem, just no.

MrBeast really deserved that award, but knowing him I don‚Äôt think he cares. He too knows it‚Äôs bullshit
Everyone&#39;s talking about Poppy Smoria and Mary Ham but what about Erin Burnett
&quot;The project is myself, i can&#39;t sell myself.&quot;<br><br><b>Are you sure about that?</b>
Alright guys let&#39;s be real these comments are pretty unoriginal.

Tana Mongoose pay to win creator of the year
Plot twist: Pewdiepie quit youtube but poppy smoria took over his channel and didn&#39;t change the channel name because she didn&#39;t want people to know that she&#39;s operating the pewdiepie channel.<br>Edit: i confused poppy gloria and poppy smoria together i am sorry for i have sinned.
This is incredible &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; actually sayed that he was over worked and that he was going to take break!!! This just Proves my point even More how USA is a piece of crap country
Pewdiepie:coughsüò∑<br><br>Media:pewdiepie has coronavirus <br><br>Who is watching in 2020
pewds has more integrity then trad. media =TRUTH
<b>MAMA awards triggered</b>
Pewds: blinks<br>Media: OMG GUYS HES GONNA DESTROY THE WORLD

pewdiepie: goes offline for 1 second<br>media: pewdiepie has quit youtube
pretty sure I hadn&#39;t even brushed my teeth every day in the past 10 years
The news that I will watch
This is why pew quit youtube<br><br><b>PEWDIE</b> bye
Pewdiepie- &quot;So I had this low quality version of this.&quot;<br>Ad- &quot;Damnit! How could this happen?&quot;<br>Skips rest of ad.<br>Pewdiepie- &quot;Cause they changed the title.&quot;
pewdiepie nooooooooo =[
no... nOT THE LIINKED IN
I would be so happy if you were quitting <i>YOUTUBE</i>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=632">10:32</a> why is this so wholesome
For three months, till today I thought pewds quit... Trump was right fake news everywhere
Marzia put a black magic spell on you. That&#39;s why you are still connected to me because we were made for each other. You came to me and said we were married. Ok I&#39;m going to say it  Jack Septic eye slept with her. The water Bottle Flip  one. In the beginning you went to the bathroom and he bragged about it. Then you shot him and went to jail. You went back in time and edited it. That is why Jack is still alive.  I was watching NASA&#39;s trip to the moon. That might help you.
This is a quick interpretation of how the ‚Äú news‚Äù are willing to go so damn low, jeez
&#39;pewdiepie farts&#39;<br><br>media: he&#39;s maKIngg fuUn oOf PEoPLe wiTH dIorREA
He obviously just wanted the money
Pewdiepie: <b>still alive</b><br>News: He&#39;s making fun of dead people
Pew News : The Real News
RIP

I want him to say &quot;apostrophe&quot; 10 times in a row.
I am VERY IMPRESSED That PewDiePie Actually Has 103M Subscribers and is the Most Popular YouTuber Ever. If You Think About It, Theres 7B People In The World and 100M is Like a 10th of 1B. Hopefully That Makes Sense.

Uhh ummmm... i don&#39;t feel so good

I found where all the stupid people come
And then he took a break....
Now I realize he really quit :&#39;(
It&#39;s okay buddy. You don&#39;t need to explain yourself. I know. I created you. It&#39;s me god. Stop being a pussie and enjoy yourself. You&#39;re fans will be right here waiting.

Pewdiepie: <b>*breathes*</b><br><br>Media: PewDiePie <b>STEALING</b> the Earth&#39;s oxygen
Maybe they were just broadcasting a couple of months into the future
Pew: Kills stuff animal<br><br>Media: OMG PEWDS HAS BEEN AN ANIMAL ASSAULTER ALL THIS TIME
Safiya is AWESOME! talk about someone who does her reaserch!
Instead of saying you&#39;re taking a break you should say &quot;IM GOING ON VACAY!!!&quot;
Why is this guy popular?

But its real on 2020
2020 is officially the worst year ever
This did not age well...
I think they were true
Pewdiepie: <b>gets flu</b><br><br><br>Media: pewdiepie has corona virus ü¶†
You suck now you gave up your crown
And now üò¢üò¢ it&#39;s true.
So racist! u want everyone to earn their profits from dlive, and try to make this world connected with tron and bittorrent! Best thing u could ever have done! last time i use youtube!
F
Fun fact, yellow journalism (fake news) was invented by Benjamin Franklin, to win more support for the revolutionary war of the united states of america against the British. Yes, dude did invent some crazy schmech in his life, including that.
How long will his break be?
Pewdipie reaction be like: <b>Whats happening to thiz people</b>
Cannabis is legal in CA. As is prescription Adderall. <br><br>But you are right. I don‚Äôt know why young people think drugs are ‚Äòcool‚Äô. If you‚Äôre gonna use legal things, just do it without the need to brag. Coz so many people do it. It‚Äôs nothing. It‚Äôs boring.
Whos watching when he acutually quits youtube
Pewdiepie: Im taking a break<br>Poppy Smoria: Pewdiepie is taking a break<br>Media: Racist, Antisemite Pewdiepie quits Yuotube.
I just liked how straightforward and honest he was about that Tanna thing. He straight up said he hated her without caring about what others might think or what she might&#39;ve said. I üíØ% liked and appreciated that tbh.
The news and media rarely attacks these celebrity drug promoters but always attacks the gamers who are not even a sliver close to as bad.

Sorry if you actually quit
I hope you will have a great reast thank you for making us lugh i hope you will have a great time in japan with your family and god bless you i hope you will have a safe tripüòä
This is very good news.
To create the world you want to live in, you need to stick up for the people you believe in. I really dislike when the media tries to tear Pewdiepie down. I&#39;m not a super fan and don&#39;t watch every video he puts out, but I will stick up for him if others try to bring him down.
Just don‚Äôt leave
Pliz come back
Pewdiepie: this is bullshit
well im happy that poods take a break, because theres still a lot of videos that i need to catch upüòÇüòÇüòÇ not to mention, there r still videos in the past yrs that i havent watch

Nah he ain‚Äôt, he just taking a break
The truth that pewdiepie is quitting YouTube because of terms of service
Pewdiepie: <b>dies</b><br>Media: He&#39;s making fun of alive people
I quit being alive
I was on my google page just searching up dog videos i go back twice and i see a picture of Felix and it says &quot;pewdiepie the king of YouTube has joked about running out of ideas and quiting youtube, its good to see hes taking that joke seriously&quot; i flipped out! And that lead me to watching this video, im so glad that hes not
Plz dont quit
Ever
Good now dont come back
Felix, we understand. If you need to take a break we get it. You need time for yourself. Everyone needs a bit of me time. If you need to then you can take a break. Take as long as you want we understand take time off spend time with Marzia we will be alright. So take a month off we will be fine. We understand
Honestly did we really expect anything else from the media
It is just a break right ?
You will post again right ? Please don&#39;t stop posting i just started watching you and i love it.
News must be embarrassed
Pewdiepie: gets on plane to go on holiday <br><br>News media: Felix is planing 9/11 two
Man, this Poppy Smoria person really reminds me of PewDiePie. :&#39;(
Pewdie I‚Äôm out
Sorry you have to burden this crap pewds. Never mind. 100 million people have your back. Not to mention Marzia ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Clearly pewds has never seen simplys channel lmao
Pewdiepie: Sleep<br>Media: Pewdiepie is dead in 2020
So this were it ends
The streamy awards hold absolutely no value. Especially after Tana winning ANY award, much less greater of the year
It was one of the main headline on the news channel for me XD
are we just going to ignore the was he said apostrophe
Pewdiepie:‚ÄúI am really sad.‚Äù<br>Also pewdiepie:*laughs*
Everytime he speaks in swedish accent he making fun of Greta Thunberg
I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re the most subscribed person on youtube. I can&#39;t imagine if another &quot;creator&quot; had 100mln subscribers, I understand it&#39;s really difficult for you but really I thank you for being so modest and an example for everybody. Stay strong Felix
I hate how the media cant take a joke, neither can half of the internet
Good on you! Screw everyone else take time for you. We love you Pewds! End of the last video was better too. Can&#39;t believe the hype
People that don‚Äôt watch your videos and still see those news places will believe it all
With Awards It&#39;s like in IT industry ... you want your startup to be funded... move your startup to States. Simple, boohaaa!
Love comments! So true!!!
Had such a good laugh!!! A joke... all that media crap :D but still fun if you have head on your shoulders :)
How did you just say apostrophe?üòÇ
When you realise beating the enderdragon is on the same level as getting 100 mil subs and getting married
that beanie tho
Why would pewds take a break from linkedinüò≠üò≠ this is so sad
I ate food
Pewdiepie: <b>Literally doing nothing but existing</b><br><br>Media: <b>He&#39;S mAkInG fUn Of PeOpLe ThAt DoN&#39;t ExIsT</b>
PewDiePie showed me that I could lose myself if I were to be a successful YouTuber due to this constant media involvement.
whats the fan password, i forgot.
brofist dont let go!!!!!
This comment section is so supportive
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=649">10:49</a> WTF does that even mean?
During the break they&#39;re going to say he died or he had a child
<b>And that is why Pew New is the most reliable News Source on the planet!</b>
pewdiepie feed your parrots a cookie they will breed &gt;.&lt;
why do they all use the same 3 pictures of pewdiepie for their articles
Pewdiepie we love you dont quit
Pewdiepie: blinks<br>Media: omg write that down did you get that did you get that<br>Media again: how can we make this fictional?
Lies no quit

Big Brain moment<br>Pewdiepie is taking a break to escape from January memes
I hope he doesn‚Äôt quit MySpace üò¢
I have a question. Where did all the Minecraft videos go??
Literal proof that cnn is fake news.
Putting out a video every day for years without stop definitely warrants a break. He has earned it.
Guys, I‚Äôm heartbroken<br>Why is he quitting üòî
Aw, man. You have a loyal enough fandom that you can take 6 months off, come back and your fans will die of happiness. Take a break, rest, travel, enjoy Marzia and the rest of the family, discover new things you like doing, go out there!!!! Enjoy YOUR life. YOURS! Real fans don&#39;t read or care about bullshit media crap. Real fans want your happiness! You gave us 1736363662 videos that made us happy and distracted us from our miserable lives. You don&#39;t even have to explain anything! We&#39;re not your boss, this is not an office. Youtuber aren&#39;t granted sick days, bad days, vacation days. So you&#39;re the one that need to realize when your mind and body needs rest. So go, have fun, have another honeymoon ‚ù§ Marzia knew when she needed to take care of herself and was like &quot;i&#39;m out&quot;, that was incredibly brave. Take it from her and leave for as long as you feel you need. You have money, that&#39;s not a problem, so you can focus on actually using it for things you wanna do, maybe even new projects you were postponing, or just simply rest your mind. Also take it from someone who spent 5 years 100% focused on work and used the money i made to go back and forth from work and eat after work cause I was too tired to cook. Like it or not, this is a job now. But so much different. In an office you don&#39;t need to read hate comments every day, gossips about you, have to smile when you don&#39;t feel like it. Entertaining is so stressful, it takes so much energy to enjoy thing when you have eyes on you all the time. Not that is a bad job at all! I&#39;m sure you love it and your fans! But everyone needs a rest every once in a while. You go, those who really care about you will wait ^‚Ä¢^
Pewdiepie: I‚Äôm tired<br><br>News: pewdiepie is qUitiNg
PewDiePie: I‚Äôm gonna take break<br>News Channels: So you choose... death?
&#39;I can&#39;t sell myself&#39;.....are you sure<br>I think your fans would love that
pewds flexing his galaxy fold
Felix: Don&#39;t hit me, i&#39;m swedish.<br><br><br>Media: PewDiePie, racist to all countries exept for sweden.
Pewdiepie if you are going to quit YouTube  don&#39;t  tell jimmy
It&#39;s not unheard of for celebrities to get targeted by tabloids for any mundane thing they do - like Pewds, who&#39;s basically just taking some time off of his full-time job.<br><br>What&#39;s really sad is how many news outlets have essentially turned into tabloids.  They don&#39;t actually tell the news anymore; they fabricate stories for profit instead.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=770">12:50</a> but pewds, she‚Äôs all quirky and different. Don‚Äôt you get that it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs quirky and different, guys it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs so quirky. Can you see how quirky she is
PewDiePie : Has a lot of subscribers<br><br><br><br>Media : He has an affair
There are Youtube awards? This is ridiculous
So like Simply Nailogical is a kids channel now?üòÇüòÇ didn‚Äôt get the memo
Remember kids, PewDie-Bye doesn&#39;t exist in Youtube!
I think it&#39;s because your old video
I was way too distracted by the face on the beanie

Media: Pewdiepie backtracks quiting youtube statement after receiving backlash
Lol freaking mainstream media they always have to spin stuff and get everything wrong while doing it.  Their job is to inform us, but they disinform us instead.
Felix I‚Äôm a heartbroken fan this is so sad
Wait they have awards for this sort of thing now? It really has gone corporate. No wonder the soul has been sucked out
I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôve been because I live in London and haven‚Äôt seen all this media talking about Pew Di pie.

ik that tana is an addict and that‚Äôs like. a real struggle yknow? i‚Äôm not out here shaming anyone for being an addict. but don‚Äôt promote taking drugs, especially not to young kids, and ESPECIALLY NOT ADDERALL!!! weed isn‚Äôt all that bad but adderall can kill you AND it makes it harder for people like me who have adhd to get our fucking medicine, which we ACTUALLY NEED. if you‚Äôre addicted youre addicted (and you should be getting help but w/e) just don‚Äôt promote that shit to kids
Im in belgium and they say it on tv
Pewds: Says he is having a kid.<br>The media: He&#39;s planning on murdering his grandma
Tana mongooooooose

@PewDiePie , this video is my first time ever watching one of your videos or content. One question, is That a shirt of the old school hardcore punk/thrash band Heresy ? If so you just made me very proud of you &amp; I‚Äôll fuck with ya, <br>~FiVEL~
I don&#39;t understand what actually is the point of these creator awards when you know that the most relevant ones win.
Pewdiepie: Makes a Video during his ‚Äúbreak‚Äù<br><br>Media: Wait no, that‚Äôs not how you play the game!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=398">6:38</a> PewDiePie&#39;s a liar, vlogger confirmed üòÄ
Did pewds just call simplynailogical a kids channel? Wow, he has small pp
My man&#39;s taking a vacation from his job and people are having a meltdown like he is quitting his job. Lmao people are pathetic.
It was also reported on zee news in India too
Lowkey while Felix is on his break I kinda want him to change his name from ‚ÄúPewdiepie‚Äù to ‚ÄúPoppy Smoria‚Äù while he‚Äôs gone so when he changes it back we can be excited for his return.
Pewdiepie: <b>Breathes</b><br><br><br><br><br>The media: He took our oxygen

Hey, if ur reading this comment, then you probably can read, good stuff.
At least you didn&#39;t &quot;die&quot; like Jackcepticeye
does everyone else also say &#39;apostrof&#39; when saying apostrophe?. Imma start using that.
When I first heard the news a few things came to mind one was that you were tired you had been uploading for years dealing with attacks from everyone and had broken record after record and figured you may just want some time to relax and spend time with marzia and settle into the married life so spend some time away from YouTube and do what you need to do for you
What‚Äôs the Song in the background

Racism is so exhausting. Felix deserves a break!
I wish people were not that stupid :)
Pewdiepie, definition of a legitimate human being. Much love xx
How does CNN always find a way to put racism in everything they write
Ok T-Series waste but why did you tease India
Im actually really sad to hear that news before your video cause im used to your video and + why did you deleted your Twitter account im just crying right now üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Pewds: Yare Yare Daze<br>Media: he speaks Japanese and <b>he&#39;s</b> wants a break from living.
When pewds says he is quitting YouTube <br>But it was Poppy Simoria üòè
I feel bad for youüòî, fans understand why you would take a break, a video a day can be a lot of work, take a break and live a life for a little
lazerbeam is better
Deep down this dude has always been humble and tons of people basically give him shit for being real.

Who watches PewDiePie mostly just for his accent?
A p o s t r o p h e

I hope young people realize just how badly the Main Stream Media cannot be trusted.

Tana mongeau is the Billie eilish of youtube

Bruh....
Pewdiepie : shaking his head<br><br>Media : pewdiepie is making fun of those who has no head
I want pewds to be my grandpa. He has a lot of wisdom and facts.
PEWDIEPIE SAYS HE IS GOING TO JUMP OFF A CLIFF<br>HE SAID HE HAS BEEN HAVING CONVULSIONS<br>AN ERA HAS ENDED<br>HE HATES JEWS TOO AND POSSIBLY BLACK PEOPLE<br>HE IS JOINING THE DEEPSTATE
So my mom hates you because she says you hate Jewish people. Is this true?
Pewdz: I am not a vlogger <b>I vlogged the honeymoon</b>
I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t stand David Dobrik. Mr. Beast is cool for everything he&#39;s done. I love Safiya, and Simply. I&#39;m ok with Tana. Award Shows are just famous people giving themselves awards. üòÇ
So everyone forgot TanaCon huh
Not watching pewds recent vids starting last week so that i can watch him while hes away without being repetitive<br><b>big brain awakened</b>

2020: PewDiePie quits<br><br>2021: PewDiePie&quot;Everybody meet Felix Jr.&quot;
Pewdiepie: doesn‚Äôt have AirPods<br>Media: making fun of people in wheelchairs
fresh 9yolds actually can learn a lot from pewnews, they know pewds content, they know pewds, also they can see the controversies in the media. In my opinion one of the best examples that TV, newpapers, or whatever aren&#39;t always right nor rightful. They can see it with their own eyes and proof it wrong. That&#39;s a lesson many of us old folks learned much later, or haven&#39;t even learned yet.
YouTube should advertise the voting but in a way like ‚Äú bot for ur fav creator without any biased based on ur subscriptions‚Äù
where did he get that cute ass beanie though is the real question
Pewds this was even on belgian news
You should think about yourself - it&#39;s your life :). If it&#39;s time to change you go and do it. Love to you! xxx
Haha bra

HOW COULD HE BREAK?!
But...nothing CNN said was untrue? Of course he can go after low budget internet tabloids and the &quot;news media&quot;
Why is everyone freaking out too, if he wants to take a break let him. He makes a video every single day and then has to deal with shit like this.
Its just like taking leave guys come on please be smart
Wow Poppy Smoria taking over? Thank God
pewdiepie: <b>wearing headphones</b><br>Media: he‚Äôs making fun of deaf people who cant use them.

I haven&#39;t seen a lot of the last few videos but even I knew it wasnt a permanent hiatus üôÑ news media are blatantly selling lies and that&#39;s just a social norm. WTF is up with society man. But also yay! Get that rest Peds!

Is it just me or do I want him to have a 9 month break...
Wait what you telling me the news is fake?!!??  Shhhhitt I would listen to my 5 yr old tell me that the sky is falling before I believe what I hear or see coming from a news source.  That&#39;s the problem we care too much about what is said about us online.  Enjoy your life and forget about whatever these fake news sources are saying and when you do decide to come back to your puppet master I mean fans we will be here waiting.

I was so conflicted Upon reading the title, and seeing the video. I didnt want to watch it at first cause I thought for a moment this was a legitimate &quot;I quit&quot; video and i was very heart broken, then I watched it and and was VERY RELIEVED.<br>I won&#39;t lie there have been videos that you have done that I have HATED either something you said or did but I being a life long bro(female)in the bro army, still watched and liked the videos because there was some things I may have liked or you put such effort into your videos and channel that i give your videos the likes they deserve.

Sorry Pewds but Simply Nailogical is not a kids channel.
Mfw apostroff
Alright guys let‚Äôs be real these comments are pretty unoriginal.
The legend won&#39;t quit that easily. He risk his career and then quit? That is not so real. Another BIG FAT FAKE media news
Very nice idol powerrrrr powerrrrr
How often will you use the same face on the thumbnail<br><br>Pewds: Yes
Did you... Did you call Simplynailogical a kids channel??
Are you moving to mixer too? M$ sellouts.
So nobody&#39;s ganna talk about the fact that he called<br>Simply nailogical a kids channel lmao
Even my dad heard about it now that‚Äôs sad
This video was actually very nice and instructive. Good job Felix, you can go on YouTube professional.
Hello humans who read this.<br>I am asking for a big favour, as I am trying to get in contact with Pewdiepie (Felix) because I have a business id√©a I think he would be interested in.<br><br>I am Swedish aswell as Felix and want to discuss a business id√©a with him, but it is very hard to get in contact with him or his &quot;manager&quot; or whatever I need to in order to have a chance of him reading what I have to say.<br><br>Christmas is here in 2 hours and all I really wish is to forward a Email to him explaining my id√©a<br><br><br><br>This is as random as it gets but I am desperately trying to get in contact with him so I am now trying every way possible.<br><br>Just 5 minutes with him or his manager would mean the world to me, I know many people probably try to do this but my id√©a is very big and can affect the internet in a good way since a new youtube era is here.<br><br>I really dont know what else to write other than this is my biggest dream and it would be an honor to atleast get an Email that he could read.<br><br><br><br>Best regards, Alex from South of Sweden.
How dare you be against open borders and children&#39;s genitals being mutilated (for everywhere except Israel). You anti-semite!!! Next you&#39;ll go full National Socialist and be against child rape.

I worked myself into a burn-out. Dident give myself enough off time and took my work home with me....<br><br>Take a break if you want dude. Its good for you. Keeps you sane.
This is like the SSundee took a break but worse, cause Pewdiepie didn&#39;t actually take a break yet.<br>Just saying, I didn&#39;t recognise any of those nominee&#39;s for creator of the year. Other than Chamberlin which I feel I&#39;ve heard somewhere before, I don&#39;t know these people. (other than mr. beast and ninja)

I think most people understand why Felix would want to take time out with his  lovely wife Marzia. <br>Wishing you both a very Merry Christmas, adventures and happiness in 2020. XXX
Pewdiepie: talks about how media is displaying false information <br><br><br>Pewdiepie‚Äôs fans: makes fun of the media with this meme format
Why are they like that though? Why don&#39;t you report something that is more important then &quot;Pewdipie quiting&quot;. For example, the Hong Kong protests.
Pewdiepie: <b>looks outside</b><br>Media: <b>PEWDIEPIE HAS DESTROYED THE EARTH WITH HIS RACIST EYES!</b>

You did not, you don&#39;t have enough money yet.
Pewds I respect you alot, but I don&#39;t think you should talk about tana&#39;s past and make her look bad. We your audience have looked past your &quot;bad&quot; decisions and like you despite them. I believe you are more mature than them.

YouTube doesn&#39;t have the guts to remove PewDiePie because they know he&#39;s our king, and if he falls we all bail. Instead, YouTube has been slowly taking out less important targets.

My classmate that hate Pewdiepie: YES!!! Your Piewdiepie quits YT<br><br>ME AND THE REST OF MY GANG THAT SUPPORTS PIEWDIEPIE: hahaha * claps for their stupidity*
I want that ditto face looking hat
Explanation pewdiepie wants to take a break because he wants to make bebes
I like how they always mention his &quot;racism&quot;, even if it&#39;s ab article about Pewds taking a sh*t they will find a way to remind us of what he said back in 1985 because he&#39;s still cOntROverSiaL. Yellow press at its finest
The state of fake news... all mainstream outlets.<br>And yet they ban YOUTUBERS..  INDEPENDANT media...
Simple exemple of media manipulation. It applies in everything, specialy in the palestine conflit
I looooove PEW NEWS
my dad read the title and told me that pewdiepie was gonna quit youtube and I was like what!?! That&#39;s impossible! now im mad at him
I&#39;m glad pewds can laugh at this, I&#39;d get so annoyed if people kept misunderstanding what I was saying
most genuine youtuber. smart and funny too
How is she not ARRESTED!
‚Äúso much has happened this year‚Äù <b>enderdragon</b>
GUYS HE SAID ‚Äú20 years later when i quit‚Äù MEANING HE WILL STILL MAKE VIDEOS FOR A FEW YEARS

Pewdiepie: breaths <br><br><br><br>Media: he&#39;s making fun of people with asthma

PewDiePie: Supports people taking breaks from work<br>Liberal Media: PewDiePie thinks millionaires have it hard<br>Conservative Media: PewDiePie is a commie
This was really good content. Probably because I agreed with everything pewds said...but it could also be that this is legit good content.
Wish u and mazia so much luck in the future ! Ur development in the past months or maybe years is amazing and I&#39;m so fricking existed about ur &quot;coming back&quot;. Again, wish u the best. <br>Ps kinda jealous, but that&#39;s not typical me.

This is how media treats the migration issue in Europe too.
Funny how mainstream media desperately tries to act like it&#39;s in tune with internet culture. <br><br>Ok boomers. Maybe do some journalism now.

The amount of attention they give you must be flattering. You‚Äôre like a well known lightening rod they can use for propaganda.<br><br>Instead o being annoyed that someone is so successful, why not be inspired and try to learn how they do what they do. That‚Äôs seems more fruitful. They‚Äôre not like magic and contain something that can‚Äôt be replicated. I mean various things might have made it easier for them, which you could say about anything, but it might also be easier for you so who knows, either way you‚Äôd at least get better by studying them.

NEWSFLASH: Pewdiepie Quits Snapchat
in every countries , there are trash reporters in media. In Korea we call them &quot;ki re gi&quot; = &quot;Í∏∞Î†àÍ∏∞&quot;

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=260">4:20</a> there‚Äôs your answer for why they‚Äôre  blowing it out of proportion. It‚Äôs for the brain dead people who actually read their garbage unironically
I thought it was believable, but I‚Äôm not at all surprised it was fake as shit.
I didn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôd gone practically nonstop this whole time.  I really hope you don‚Äôt stress out from NOT constantly working and checking everything.  I hope your vacation goes great though.  You really do deserve to blow us off for a while and think about yourself, Marzia, and your critters üíï
What if he‚Äôs not even taking a break
pewdiepie quits YouTube<br>when?
Stupid media, should have been Mr. Awesome Beast!
if he stops making videos,maybe he&#39;ll lose all his subscribers
YOU DESERVE THIS BREAK
Apostrophe
Lol if it was fan voted, can we just take a moment to realize that Mr.Beast chose to save the earth than tell his fans to vote him creator of the year. We all know he would have won if he told his fans to vote for him.

When he takes a break he should just pre record like a 20 hr play through of some game and upload like 45 min once a week for his die hard fans, right?
<b>Ninja? Ok...</b> üòÇ
I can understand that you need a break and be heartbroken at the same time thank you very much
What would we do without News Media?
In reality, he‚Äôs on hiatus
peuu neuus
Omg I am so sad
Appastrof
People forget pewds took a break last year in August, it wasn&#39;t too long but it was significant cause he prepared no videos. He&#39;s allowed to have breaks
Felix:i got robbed af <br><br>Media:&quot;he&#39;s making fun of helpless people&quot;

Noooooooo Felix

The most subtle flex with the fold phone
jesus christ poor gus had to sit at that award thing yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck

They don&#39;t do the work anymore they just guess now
&quot;I cant let someone step in&quot;<br>say that to raywilliamjohnson

I am from Taiwan, and I feel annoyed that the mainstream media here use Pewdiepie&#39;s name to write articles just to gain more views.<br><br>I don&#39;t watch Pewds&#39; youtube every day (I really love to, tho lol), but the moment I saw those articles pop up I immediately knew it can&#39;t be true that pews is quiting youtube. Very funny that the articles about pews quiting youtube almost have the same content: a.) pewdiepie is king of youtube and b.) shocking news that he will leave youth because c.) he said &quot;I want to take a break&quot;
We&#39;re talking about Media Pewdiepie, What did you wait for?
A-pos-troph?
My local radio station talked about it
PewDiePie: <b>Is tired</b><br><br>Media: &quot;GUYS HE&#39;S TIRED HE&#39;S GONNA QUIT&quot;<br><br><br>PewDiePie: <b>actually generating secondary content through subtly indicating highly misleading statement leads that entices poorly immersed journalists from mainstream media outlets to his advantage</b><br><br>Media: <b>*surprised Pikachu face*</b>

Pewdiepie : I am not a vlogger !<br>Pewds&#39; video : I vlogged the Honeymoon
This format: I&#39;m basically top text bottom text<br>People: I like this and I&#39;ll comment like this because it gets so many likes

Pewdiepie: a gamer/youtuber creator<br><br>The media: this is a certified vlogger classic

You go Pewd‚Äôs, take a break, relax for a while, enjoy some time without worry, we will miss the content for a bit, but everyone needs a break.
Here in the Netherlands every youtuber in the news is called a vlogger
Pewdiepie says he&#39;s taking a break, doesn&#39;t realize YouTube doesn&#39;t allow vacations.
Pewdiepie is quitting YouTube? About time.
Pewdiepie was like a father to me
He really called simply a kids channelüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Quit youtube is not something that you do. Its not a day to day job. You just stop.
Someone should tell PewDiePie about this.
Just take a vacation a few dedicated weeks of the year it really helps
Pewdiepie: Has no cool awards<br>Also Pewdiepie: Awards are dumb guys
Media: YouTube royalty Pewdiepie has been outmatched by an eight-year-old boy after his dramatic announcement that he&#39;d be taking a break from the video site.
Liberal media is a joke<br>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised because of all the slander and reticuling he gets from it that he probably leans more to the right, not like that&#39;s a bad thing of course
OMG THIS IS SO SAD
19 yr olds let pewds take a break and let&#39;s wait until he comes back
Please don&#39;t quit Youtube, the media was lying don&#39;t listen to them. I still need you Pewdiepie and the whole Bro Army also still needs you too. So don&#39;t leave us Pewds. We still love you bro. Be strong. And brofist too.
