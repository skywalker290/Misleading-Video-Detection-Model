Lack of knowledge 😂<br><br>Pant Pratinidhi is itself higher position than Pant Pradhan (peshwa), why would pant pratinidhi downgrade his position from being 2nd to 3rd
Hello / hi !!! I m Gunjan Newaskar this side!!! I wish to dedicate this iconic historic scene to the three people who have influenced my life 01) The greatest allrounder GOAT one &amp; only Gaurav Malhotra urf Dewas Palty He was from Dewas his father used to work at Avery high  respected position in the Bank Note Press (BNP) of India He is a Jat by religion so bravery is in his religion, caste &amp; creed by birth he was very hot blooded but he was not sanki / short tempered!!! He always used his mind over his heart he was good with the good &amp; very very bad to the bad. He was so brave &amp; daring &amp; solid that all people used to fear him, even the seniors also,  but he was also loving, smart, handsome, super sexy, rough &amp; tough, gentle &amp; humble at the same time!!!❤❤❤ His interests included music, mathematics, poetry, drawing &amp; arts, sexy khubsurat, haseen, nazneen, pariyon jaisi sundar hot mast chodu maal ladkiyon ko chedna / eve teasing karna etc badtameezi, all of us used to enjoy his company i still remember he used to play mouth organ like sound with a hair comb also he used to play dotodrums he &amp; his voice was so man nish he was very much masculine girls used to fap on him I met him in Savita college batch of 1999-2003 he was also very good in academics/ studies also he got 98/100 marks in mathematics in XII standard ee was a very loving &amp; smart person and a humble &amp; noble guy but he was very vulgar &amp; obscene he used to make dirty &amp; nasty comments about girls he used to do dirty non veg jokes all the time I personally hail him as the greatest champion he was good in sports &amp; athletics as well he used to play cricket &amp; volleyball he presently works as a Delivery Manager in TCS Germany &amp; is married to a beautiful absolutely ravishing drop dead gorgeous woman it&#39;s a love marriage his wife our bhabhi used to work in TCS as well he has two very beautiful cute pretty daughters he lives in Munich, Germany !!! ❤❤❤ Salute to him he is still alive he is a living legend &amp; am ideal example for all of the young generation 2) The GOAT manager (now CEO) one &amp; only
If Peshwa Bajirao lived for even 10 years more and Madhavrao survived till 40, Maratha Empire would&#39;ve reached Iran and Afghanistan and they probably wouldn&#39;t have lost the third battle of Panipat too.
Who is waiting for RANBIR KAPOOR, ALIAA BHATT, VICKY KAUSHAL, <br><br>&quot;LOVE &amp;WAR&quot; ❤🌸🪄
Better than arjun kapoor
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqTLr_hviPs&amp;t=247">4:07</a> his brightness look, shines in his eyes, feels ghoosbhumbs.......
Babijao is great but why had to love mastani.......though if he did.....we didn&#39;t imagine the pain of Kashi Bai.....we felt goosebumps just watching this but it had happened in real life....
Jai Ho Brahman Yodha<br>Jai Sri Parshuram
Movie start hone k time Dailouge aha he😊
Harharmahadeo.
All rajputs jaats and gurjars should realize that he is the most successful warrior of modern india.jai parshuram
My father is big officer all of say your are bad boy ..<br>But reality to scene 😊
The scene is dramatized very effectively but why did ranveer singh did not do namaskar/mujra to chatrapati when he arrives. Dont you think it is insult of chatrapati.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqTLr_hviPs&amp;t=180">3:00</a> Better than Adipurush 🙏🏼😂
best scene
Love this scene and Bajirao&#39;s entrance. Ranveer is spectacular!!
DELHI TERI MAA BHEE GAYEE HAI KABHI. KUTTE.
Prior to this movie...I never thought that Ranveer Singh would ever make it A list Actors. Ranveer Singh nailed it.<br>Hats Off to Sanjay Leela Bhansali for creating such an amazing story of a Warrior - Bajirao Mastani
Sabhi aadarniya maharaj ko mera naman .❤
Shahu ji maharaj ❤.
For those who thinks, why does a politician like Pant claimed  a Peshwa post and king didn’t protested, because like Bhat family, the Pant family were also famous in Maratha politics. Sripat rao Pant was a capable military general also his father Pershuram trimbak were both Peshwa and Pant.

This is something different
One of best scene in indian cinema. Of all time.
ॐ मुस्कान 🌹🙏🏻
Seeing this scene literally gives me goosebumps
ॐ नमः शिवाय 🤍♥️🙏🏻
This whole design was made by Nitin Desai, RIP.
Yaha kai log bus brahmin ka hool de rhe hai jabki karm se baji rao ek kashtriy tha. Geeta me likha hai manushya ka jiwan karm Pradhan hota na ki jaati Pradhan. Geeta humara sarvochh granth hai aur mai usse sahmat hu. Jinhone bajirao ka saath diya wo sab brahmin nai the. Jinhone bajirao ka har ladai me saath diya apna lahu bahaya usme har karm aur jati ke log the. To brahminwad ka thikra taha na fodo. Akele brahmin ne kuch nai ukhaada. Sare maratha logo ke tyag aur balidan ke fal swaroop unhe ye samrajya prapt hua hai. Chatrapati shivaji maharaj, Chatrapati Sambhaji mahraj aur na jane kitne maratho ne apna lahu bahaya hai ess mitti ke liye. Ek akele bajirao ne maratha Empire khada nhi kiya hai.
⚠️WARNING⚠️<br>Shameless Converts in this comment section have no shame and are defending the same Mughal bastards that r@*ed their Great great Grandma&#39;s and butchered their Forefathers and converted them!<br>Have they no common sense?<br>Their Hindu ancestors must be rolling in their Graves!
Best one
Peek ranvir
Bojo ku mas Ranveer memang seng paling ganteng 🥰
Woooow dialogue proud to be a part of this cultural heritage
That Picture of Chhatrapati shivaji Maharaj and Sambhaji mahraj in Background. 😍<br><br>Bhansali nailed this movie
ok
Bajirao has to prove himself to become peshwa
Mahesh voice is damn suitable 😍😍💞
Ajinkay sir vale like karoo faas ;)
For only one arrow?? 😃
Can&#39;t believe this guy is now acting in movies like Cirkus and Jayesh Bhai Jordar
EPIC🤩🤩
I am Karnataka and chatrapati shivaji maharaj is in my heart
I am a Muslim bt blood boils when see this movie
एक ऐसी मूवी जो बहुत ही खतरनाक कंटेंट के साथ उभर सकती थी मगर उसे प्यार मोहब्बत का नाम देकर बाजीराव को उतना प्रभावशाली नही दिखाया जिसे कही जादा वो बलशाली बहादुर और बुद्धिवांत थे जिनके सामने अच्छे-अच्छे मुगल सरदार नही टिक पाते थे
Proud💪💪💪 to be born on sanatan
⚔️🇮🇳⚔️जय हो ⚔️🇮🇳⚔️
Here,  Peshwa is not doing his original job! Ranveer has enacted this role very well! but the history is incorrect!
One of the greatest leader from mratha empire 🔥🔥🔥
I, m proud to be a brahmin 😎
Remember that moment when watching this scene and listening to the bgm in theatre 😇😇😇😌
He died in 40 so sad
We Do not have leaders like Bajirao today.............That is why India is suffering.............
मैं comment section देख रहा था ,तो <br>सभी अंधनमाजि योकी जल रही है अच्छा लगा ।<br>फिल्म में ही उनको बहादुर दिखाते है एसा बोल रहे हो ,अरे भाई तुम तो ऐसा बोलोगे ही तुम तो ☪️hutiya हो।<br>Histroy जाके चेक करो आधी लुल्ली वालो।

This man was something else<br>Fought 41 battles in his lifetime but never lost. Unfortunately I m not happy with Bollywood&#39;s potrayl of him in this film.<br>Bollywood stressed too much on his love life and less on his Achievements.
Akshay should learn from him

Here comes the Greatest Peshwa Ever
badass bhai
Yeh acha hua. Bajirao Mastani.
Better if he would have been acted in prithviraj chauhan film....but offcourse let&#39;s see what Akshay kumar does....
What he is wearing in this scene?
Milind and Ranveer chemistry beautiful in Movie 🎥🍿
U all are only brave in movies...in reality  mughals  put arse to ur ass specially aurangzeb the great
Love to Marathas from Rajputana. <br>My ancestral clan is from jaisalmer, rajasthan and probably migrated to maharashtra when the invasions started in rajasthan and I have spent my whole life in maharashtra in a small town and I grew up hearing kirtans in mathas and playing with my friends who were all marathi and I never felt like I didn&#39;t belong.<br>Jai maharashtra <br>Jai shivaji.

This scene is a masterpiece.

Best actor
This is a beautiful film. Indeed their love was very powerful and consuming, but just my 2 cents worth surely a true love and pure love is meant to lift up and inspire if you divide&#39;s and courses terrible and deep wounds. Such as Bajirao&#39;s first wife is it true? this love divided people into fractions shouldn&#39;t love also be in the sense sacrificing and not just wanting its own way but also taking into consideration of others and also one&#39;s duty. This man appeared to be a master of the battlefield and I didn&#39;t even know that swords could have those kinds of blades <br><br>Of course, I watched this film with purely western eyes and find this movie equally beautiful as well sad and moving (Black chick who loves Indian movies)
Probably the best entrance in Bollywood. ❤️‍🔥
No one like marathas
When you think about chatrapati shivaji maharaj automatically you feel energetic 🚩🚩🔥🔥
श्रीमंत बाजीराव पेशवे यांना मानाचा मुजरा 🙏🏻

After watching movie Bajirao - Mastani, people even if Peshwa Bajirao&#39;s deeds<br>Be a follower but it is an unbreakable truth that the rule of Peshwao was the most painful and humiliating period for the untouchables. Brahminism was so extreme in the rule of Peshwao that untouchables were not allowed to walk on the road. If someone walked on untouchable road, he would have to hang a clay pot around his neck. Untouchables were not allowed to spit on the ground, by doing so the ground became unholy. He could not spit on the ground, so he had to walk with a pot hanging around his neck. He had to walk with a broom behind him so that no Brahmin would fall on his footsteps and he would not be unholy. They had to walk with a bell in their hand or something making noise so that the Brahmins could hear the information of walking in their path and Brahmins would move out of their way.<br><br>Fed up with this inhuman atrocities of Peshwa, Maharashtra&#39;s Maharo joined the English army and defeated the army of Peshwa Bajirao badly. Only 500 Maharas dusted 25000 soldiers of Peshwa Bajirao II in the battle fought in Koregaon on 1 January 1818. In this war, the Mahar Regiment of the British East India Company destroyed the army of Peshwa Bajirao. Koregaon&#39;s War Memorial is a sign of the amazing strength of the Mahar race. The atrocities that Peshwa did on untouchables during his regime, there was a t
This part is one of the best scenes ever watched. The background music, roles played by Ranveer truly made it epic.
Hindu Swaraj🚩🚩🚩
Can we just appreciate the music in background from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqTLr_hviPs&amp;t=148">2:28</a> to rest of the video just hear it clearly close eyes dont see video only hear the sound . You will get to know what i am talking about.
Mast scene hain.
Bajirao&#39;s test is my favourite part in the whole film. Peshwa Bajirao was a genius. I have seen this part 100 times.
Literal goosebumps
Jai hindurashtra 🚩🚩🚩🚩
Parnam Jai Hind Sir
Maratha ki khaas baat jo unhe rajputo se alg bnaya aur jeetya ..unki soch me lachak (sirf bravery nhi) aur sab ko sangathit krne ka गुड़.
This is what we would miss in Akshay&#39;s Prithviraj.....a rock solid lead!!
chatrapati promised  bhadur shah 1 that he will never attack mughals so this sccene is misleading
Everything was great until Mastani entry 😭
He is brilliant actor 👌🔥
That score though!!!
What a actor he is...!!!Marathi Accent tak Pakad lia bhai ne ..
Padmavat ka trailer dekh liya tha isliye idhar agaya 😂
In starting who is saying that dialogue at starting who is the name of that character in movie
Har har mahadev
Har har mahadev 🚩
The best thing in this video was the bgm
it wouldve been better agar pankh gir gaya hota !!!
In 2021, whenever I see this scene I will get goosebumps.
Wow...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Theer agar raja ko lagtha
Har Har Mahadev
Bajirao Peshwa has world record of not losing even a single battle out of 42 battles he fought.
Bharman Maratha Rajputana above all We are all SANATAN who born with the universe and still live till the end of Universe 🙏 🚩🚩🚩

What does it mean? “Woh mayur pankh hai mughal saltanat ka pedh jiski jadhey hain delhi “? , peacock feathers use to grow on mughal trees ??????? 🤯
He said woh mayur pankh hai mughal saltanat ka pedh ??? Since when peacock feathers started growing on trees ?
The way Ranveer has worked hard to look, talk and convince like a marathi...<br> Is just admirable. He did it. I am impressed
Maratha Empire 🔥😎
Confidance level 🔥
Jai brahman jai rajput
&quot;Ranveer Has To Prove Himself To Become Peshwa&quot;  ...... ???<br>The creator of this video is fool......He should have mentioned &quot;Bajirao Has To Prove Himself To Become Peshwa&quot;
मराठा सिर्फ दो ही बात जाणता है| मारना या मरना|<br>धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः🚩देव,देश अन धर्म |<br>छत्रपती शिवाजी महाराज की जय🚩
Entry music is damn good
अपनी धरती अपना राज छत्रपति शिवाजी का एक ही सपना हिन्दू स्वराज 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
Very nice movie
Marathas and then Peshwas saved India...  Otherwise India would have been a Muslim Majority Nation... It is our Nation...  Nation of Hindus.. Of course we have been merciful enough to let people of other religions live... But some religions wanted to change this
lets take a moment to appreciate the cinematic prowess and culture that was expressed in this scene.
Epic scene
This movie should have included more content from his bravery but they included more from love side
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqTLr_hviPs&amp;t=73">1:13</a> कैसी हसी पंतप्रतीनीधी जी आप तो अकेले हस रहे हैं 😂😂😂👍👍
&quot;Jadd pe waar karo toh bade se bada pedh bhi gir jaata hai&quot; well said ❤️
Chatraptinna kiti old dakhvla ahe  , 100% te ase nstil
Few know that Peshwa Bajirao never lost a battle in his 20 year old military career.🔥🚩🧨💪😎
Ek hi sapna hindu swaraj 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Braham Yoddha...Shastra aur shashtra dono me mahir.
happy birhtday power house( ranveer)
Epic Scene. Peshwa ko dushmano ki kaha kami hai.
jab tak rajput or maratha bhaiyo hai tab tak mughal lo ka sans lena hi haram tha jay bhavani..har har mahadev!!!
Unfortunately all maratha leaders who were capable died at a very young age 😭😭<br>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at the age of 50<br>Chatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj at the age of 31<br>Peshwa Bajirao I at the age of 39<br>Peshwa Madhavrao at the age of 27
&quot;Ranveer Has To Prove Himself To Become Peshwa&quot; <br>Buddy, Ranveer doesn&#39;t have to prove, its Bajirao who needs to prove. At least name the title properly. Its not the actor whom you&#39;re making the story of, its the young Bajirao who&#39;s story is being told.
This movie is insulting Baji rao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqTLr_hviPs&amp;t=48">0:48</a> gossebumps 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Who is here???????
That background music gave me goosebumps

The irony of this scene is Aditya Pancholi (non-brahmin) looks exactly like a Chitpavan brahmin in terms of fair complexion and light coloured eyes while Milind Soman who&#39;s actually a Chitpavan himself doesn&#39;t look like one.
Baji Rao was better than Any other Hindu king.
Bay kya baar hia
Milind Soman ❤️
Each n every shot of this pic is iconic......
Awesome
He is not Ranveer in the movie he is Bajirao!!!! Then why to write in the title &#39;Ranveer&#39;?????
काय म्हणता
what a dualouge
I don&#39;t like this movie
I&#39;m a Hindu Jat from Haryana.<br>Proud of our Brahmin and Maratha brothers. <br>Jai Hindu Rashtra ⚔️🕉️⚔️🚩
As an actor Ranveer is masculinity personified.

Great Mr. Mahesh Manjraker Sir.
Shabaash peshwa
Peshwas ne poore desh ko barbad kar diya and for those who don&#39;t know Peshwas were not Marathas, they were Brahmins
Thanks Sanjay Leela Bhansali for touching this chapter of Maratha history and introducing the great Srimant Bajirao Peshwa not only to the world but many Indians as well.Most history books have a few paragraphs on Maratha history and don&#39;t even mention the name of Bajirao Peshwa.Maratha empire was at it&#39;s zenith in the 18th century and the credit largely goes to Bajirao peshwa who captured half of India in a span of 20 years and won all the 40 battles he fought. He was not just a lovesick person but one of the most valiant warrior not just India but the world has ever seen.
Faster than a boat faster than lighting we are the pooootiiiiisssss shakira
Its not ranveer its baji rao
I dont like bajirao. I am fan of madhavrao. The most ethical as well as invincable peshwa. Even british said if madhavrao lived mire years britush would be finished in india. Madhavrao died at 27 age due tb.
खिलजी तथा मुगलों की क्रुर तथा नीच मानसिकता का चित्रण थोड़ा, परंतु सही किया है।
Sense of indian youth. Bajirao is great man no doubt he loved a woman that is also fine.<br>But on other hand allahuddin did same but shown in wrong way.<br>Jaago india jaago. <br>Not everything is truth what we see by our eyes. This is the result of diverting india youth mind. <br>No harsh feeling for Respected Bajirao and not for Allahuddin. <br>Try to undrstand things you wont be caught in such harmful mind wash movies.
Allahu akbar <br>Winner ✅Muslim Ghuri empire vs Hindu Rajput❌loser <br>Winner ✅Muslim Durrani empire vs Hindu Maratha empire❌loser<br>In future Winner✅ Al Qaeda+Taliban vs Indian army❌loser.
This scene always gives me goosebumps....

Sanjay leela making epic movies period drama... But the typical bollywood mentality hai ki songs or love angle chahiye... Ye sub bollywood ki apic movies ko degrade kr dete hai

Milind Soman is a great actor just like Adil Hussain. He should do more movies.
Ranveer : time to play a historical figure with full dedication<br><br>Arjun kapoor : hold my failed pathetic attempt
Ranveer&#39;s Hardwork 🙏🙏🙏
why the title says &quot;ranveer&quot; .. ranveer thoda bana tha peshwa .. bajirao likna chahiye tha ..
Paanipat Movie made to show how Ranveer is better than Arjun Kapoor
Almost it was fake movie. .. 90% fake storie....
I wish my boss introduces me like this to his boss :D :D

Life time best dialogue of Ranveer....<br>And life changing movie for Ranveer
Wish this movie was about his greatness as a soldier
Chatrapati Sivaji Maharaj ke ek movie banao aur lead actor sharad Kelkar ho
Mongols were scared mostly of Maratha domination.  It is true. Even Biharis (JP Narayan)  were scared of Maratha domination.  This is the Bhagva dhwaj (Saffron Flag) not the Hara dhwaj (Green Flag). This is a good Peshwa.
Sale ye savi chutiya pakhandi janam se hi Muslim ke khelaf hai sale
Jai Shree Krishna 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Har Har Mahadev🙏🏻🙏🏻
Awesome
Best movie of Ranveer Singh
Chatrapati shivaji Maharaj🙏
i have atched this scene in tamil. i would say dubbing voice, words, the way they deliver is sharp and more powerful than original hindi version. bajirao voice need a bit more base
2.28.tune is very nice
Jai Maratha 🙏
Garv hai maratha hone ka

आठ सौ साल की गुलामी केवल एक Fake Narrative हैं और कुछ भी नहीं है । यह केवल हिंदुओं पर मनोवैज्ञानिक बढ़त की कोशिश करने के लिए दुश्मनों द्वारा इस्तेमाल की जाने वाली एक फेक Narrative या प्रचार है।  The Greatest Marathas महानतम मराठों (हिंदू) ने दुष्ट और राक्षसी मुग़लों को हराया और नष्ट कर दिया 1640 के दशक से ही और तब से पश्चिमी भारत (महाराष्ट्र और अन्य राज्य) के हिन्दू और दक्षिण भारत के हिन्दू महानतम मराठों द्वारा छत्रपति शिवाजी महाराज के शानदार नेतृत्व में मुक्त हुए। बाद में, उत्तर भारत और पूर्वी भारत के हिंदुओं को भी  महानतम मराठों और मराठा साम्राज्य (हिंदू साम्राज्य) द्वारा मुक्त किया गया। मराठा साम्राज्य (हिन्दू साम्राज्य) स्थापित किया गया था, जिसे लोकप्रिय रूप से हिंदवी स्वराज (हिंदू स्व-शासन, हिंदू स्व-शासन) के रूप में जाना जाता है।  तो अगली बार अगर कोई भी Non-Hindu किसी भी हिंदू को 800 साल के गुलामी  के बारे में बताता है, तो बस उन्हें ऊपर लिखे वाक्य बताएं। यदि वे विश्वास नहीं करते हैं, तो उन्हें सर्च करने के लिए Mughal-Maratha_Wars वि किपीडीया  पर बताएं जो स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि Decisive Maratha Victory मराठा विजयी हुए । छत्रपति शिवाजी महाराज की जय🚩🚩🚩 हर हर महादेव , जय श्री राम 🚩🚩🚩
Buster are rules in bollywood
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👏👏
Doe&#39;s not matter ranbir&#39;s acting , it was a anti Hindu film, be so shame .
Achha maratha log kabhi mughalo ke virudhh jeet kyun nahi pay??? Not trolling just asking cuz i dont know and i wanna know
Not Ranveer, you fool?
Title is wrong as who the hell Ranveer is. It the Bajirao. Who is proving to become Peshwa  Ranveer is no one. Against the maharaja Peshwa.
Om
The cinematography 😍😍😍😍.... Direction is of hollywood level, or shall i say more better than hollywood.
I love shiva g
A movie that is a blot to the name of Baji Rao and the Rao family as a whole. Bollyturd must keep to just making criminal and raunchy movies, based on its first hand experience of being a hovel of criminals and couch shakers.
Every frame of this movie is poetry in motion
I just think that he ruined his life by a dalliance with mastani. He had a plan, a future, a loving wife, strong children, the respect of his people, his soldiers and his peers. It almost seems as if mastani was sent to sabotage him.
❤❤❤❤❤srinivas rao
Copied and pasted so it doesn&#39;t get lost in comment section<br><br>James Grant Duff in his &quot;History of Mahrattas&quot;:<br>It may be truly said that, Bajirao had both, head to plan and hand to execute.<br><br>Jadunath Sarkar says in his forward to “Peshwa Bajirao I and Maratha Expansion”<br><br>“Bajirao was a heaven born cavalry leader. In the long and distinguished galaxy of Peshwas, Bajirao Ballal was unequalled for the daring and originality of his genius and the volume and value of his achievements. He was truly a carlylean Hero as king- or rather as Man of action.’ If Sir Robert Walpole created the unchallengeable position of the Prime Minister in the unwritten constitution of England, Bajirao created the same institution in the Maratha Raj at exactly the same time.<br><br>Sir R. Temple says in “Oriental Experiences”:<br><br>“Bajirao was hardly to be surpassed as a rider and was ever forward in action, eager to expose himself under fire if the affair was arduous. He was inured to fatigue and prided himself on enduring the same hardships as his soldiers and sharing their scanty fare. He was moved by an ardour for success in national undertakings by a patriotic confidence in the Hindu cause as against its old enemies, the Muhammadans and its new rivals, the Europeans then rising above the political horizon. He lived to seethe Maratha spread over the Indian continent from the Arabian sea to the Bay of Bengal. He died as he lived in camp under canvas among his men and he is remembered among the Marathas as the fighting Peshwa, as the incarnation of Hindu energy.<br><br>British General Bernerd Montgomery in his Concise History of Warfare :<br><br>They(Marathas) were at their best in the eighteenth century, and the Palkhed campaign of 1727-28 in which Baji Rao I outgeneralled Nizam-ul-Mulk, is a masterpiece of strategic mobility.<br><br><br><br>Shreemant Peshwa Bajirao Ballal Bhat🙏🙏<br><br>The Undefeated Maratha Warrior 💪💪
I&#39;m tamilan But I like maratha very much
His name is Bajirao not Ranveer
It’s Bajirao, not Ranveer, who had to prove himself...
Seen 1k times <br>Dialogues 🔥🔥
I watch most of the time<br><br>Because I love history🚩<br>Jay hind 🇮🇳
peshwas  cunningly and deceptively overthrew the ruler , i.e the CHATRAPATI . They portrayed Shahu Chatrapati as an idiot child, but the reality is they wanted to rule . Wrong history is purposely being still taught  in schools
Great attitude by ranveer
Madaboard nashedi............. ........ Tu Bajirao ji ki acting karne layak bhi nahi he nalayak.
Acting level 💯....

Ranveer jaisa actor koi nahi hai
Nice
Character less
Only he can do justice to this role and he did it 💓
The age of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj is 38 years old when Bajirao became Peshawa. In the film Maharaj seems like 60 years old man. Another mistake of the film.
One of the best scenes of Indian cinema
Ohhh... That&#39;s perfect , &quot;BAJIRAO BALAAL&quot; !!!!!. Thank god.
मदरसे में।👇<br><br>मौलवी :- सभी बच्चों को कुरान पड़ा दी गई हैं।अकरम तुम बताओ कुरान में क्या लिखा हैं?<br><br>अकरम :- मुसलमान दोगला होता हैं।<br>गुस्से में मौलवी :- बताओ कैसे?<br><br>अकरम :- कुरान में लिखा हैं कि मुस्लिम महिलाएँ बुर्के में घर से निकले पर सानिया मिर्जा तो पूरी दुनिया में अर्ध नग्न घुमती हैं।<br>कुरान में लिखा हैं कि मुसलमान महिलाएं TV नहीं देख सकती पर अकरुबुद्दीन औवेशी के घर में तो सभी TV में आइटम सांग देखते हैं।<br>कुरान में लिखा हैं कि मुसलमान लड़कियों को स्कूल नहीं जाना चाहिये पर आजम ,ओवेशी की लड़कियां तो बड़े स्कूलो में पड़ने जाती हैं।<br>कुरान में लिखा हैं कि मुस्लिम महिलाएँ डांस नहीं कर सकती पर शबाना आजमी, फराह खान जैसी सैकड़ों हीरोईन अर्ध नग्न होकर ठुमके लगा रही हैं।<br>कुरान में लिखा हैं कि हज स्वयं की कमाई से जाना चाहिये पर भारत में तो काफिरों कि आय से मुसलमान हज जाते हैं।<br><br>गुस्सा करते हुए मौलवी :- अरे मुर्ख लगता हैं की तु किसी काफीर की नाजायज औलाद हैं।😡<br><br>अकरम :- जनाब वो तो हम सब जानते ही हैं, कि हम सब मुस्लिम काफिरों की ही औलाद हैं।🤭<br><br>😀😂
I only get one thing.... Ranveer nailed each scene perfectly with his expressions, acting and tune....while deepika can&#39;t do proper expression like Priyanka or Ranveer
Jai jijau<br>Jai shivray<br>Jai shambhuraje<br>Jai bajirao
no word what I say ,,, thanks for understanding  me hope we can do something better for this earth 😍
It is like militery SSB..
Yang milih allah like yg Mili dajal hirawkan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqTLr_hviPs&amp;t=99">1:39</a>.........m.
Bajirao was lucky he wasn&#39;t asked for 6 years of experience working under a Peshwa😭
Only chattrapati should have succeeded the throne <br>The votebank system between peshwas and Chatrapati is very weakend <br>As later peshwas were very corrupted and castist not compared as elder peshwas <br>This weakened Maratha empire very badly
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqTLr_hviPs&amp;t=91">1:31</a>
🙌Jay Parshuram Jay Bajirao💖
Ranveer has to prove himself? Lol. It should be Bajirao.
Lots of respect from Belgaum, Karnataka 😍🤩

Now i see only SSR in this role :(
I support satya sanatan (which is also a youtube channel like your, the channel who only talks about the truth but YouTube banned that channel for one week..see what&#39;s the problem that we can&#39;t banned YouTube or boycott it but the thing I want to tell is what I can do I will surely do:<br>1) I will only watch the same channel videos till this whole week<br>2) I will spread this message to everyone so that if they also want to help they can also do the same<br>3) If they have time for our country then if possible then they should also spread this message to all...I till now spread this message to more than 1000 YouTube channels.. It&#39;s the time to check which YouTube channel and their members are  how much helpful for this kranti... thanku
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Epic seen❤️❤️
Very Nice Video
Abe Ranveer ke jagah Bajirao  likho
Worst direction and acting
Please all this movies are bullshit
Epic epic epic
💪
Ranveer Singh did not justice to the Peshwa role.<br>Peshwas were prime minister&#39;s.<br>Ranveer looked cheap.<br>Overacting.
🚩🚩🚩🚩🌎👑
If I reborn I would like to be as a Marathi
Wondedful expression of all the characters
Imagine Shushant Singh Rajput in this role
Ranveer or Bajirao?
Dislike vale mugal ki ullad h
Whats the sound when he arrive!???? What instrument is that?????
You don’t have to agree with me but I think Milind Soman should have played Bajirao.  He definitely would have looked the part, has the charm and personality. All he’d need to have is the marathi accent. There is so much of unused potential there
Samrat Asoka, Akbar, Chhatrapati Shivaji - India desperately needs a leader who is an amalgamation of these three great kings. They were the true benchmarks of the word INDIAN. History never lies, India prospered under their reign.
Peshwa Bajirao amar rahe.
Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj ko pranam. Chhatrapati shambhaji maharaj ki jay.
Sheepatrao ki gand..
Really that’s so big scene
After 2 doses of weeds effect...druggist
Bajirao I is one of the greatest generals that the world has ever seen.. respected by even by the British army generals who criticized India for being so divided. Bajirao can be compared to Alexander for being young and being one with his men on frontlines but just leave it to bollywood to waste such an opportunity to create a classic military movie and degrade it to a love story
Can someone please explain the issue between peshwa and mahars? Something related to the last rites of Sambhaji? Please explain the recent bhima koregaon case
Ranveer Singh is the best actor for historical films🥰
Jokar h sala
Bajirao Peshwa was a great warrior 🚩🚩🚩❤❤❤

चरसी को अच्चा अच्चा रोल मिला
Just like Byju&#39;s and unacademy - if there was a personal one to one online class to learn sanskrit and true indian sanatan history from a certified expert, would you take such a class or enroll your children into such a class for Rs. 500 per class?<br><br>Comment one of the below<br>A: Yes<br>B: May be, if fees was lesser<br>C: No. I will learn from youtube<br>D: I don&#39;t want to learn
Shouldn&#39;t the title be &quot;Bajirao has to prove himself&quot;??????
And now what&#39;s happening to Bollywood is maratha pride is hurt finally... Drugs, underworld, mafia, politicians, nepotism..
बाजीावांनी छत्रपती शाहू महाराजाना मुजरा करताना नाही दाखवलं.😠

I have come here to imagine ssr in this role....bloody Bollywood RIG (rot in grave)
Are e bhi dislike karo. Justice for sushant Singh RAJPUT.
Bajirao was youngest and most sucessful warrior after Chatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj 🚩🚩🚩
Adr
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqTLr_hviPs&amp;t=79">1:19</a> This dialogue. As if coming straight from some ancient sanskrit text. &quot;Putr pita ki pagdi pehan leto usme pita ki budhhi to nahi aa jati&quot;<br>&quot;Chandan ko sugandh dene ke liye ek umar ki avashyakta hoti hai&quot;<br>Such deep meaningful lines. Hats off to dialogue writer.
JAT or Marathao ka bada special kisam ka DNA hota hai,,

Overacting ki dukan ranbeer saala kutta
Only bhima Koregaon malum nahi kay
Apni Dharti Apna Raaj Chatrapati Shivaji ka ek he Sapna HINDU SWARAJ🕉️🕉️🕉️ Jab b ye sunta hu rongtey Khade ho jate hai aur Shivaji Maharaj ke samman mey sir jhuk jata hai.Shivaji Maharaj  ne ye Sapna tab dekha jab lagbag pure Bharat mey Islamic raaj ho gaya tha aur koi aisa Soch tak nahi sakta tha lekin Shivaji maharaj ne socha aur kara bhi. Wo Marathe he thay jinhone aage chal kar Mughalo ko dilli mey he gus kar dhool chatwayi thi. Itihas mey Hindu dharam pe jab jab Khatra aaya Bharat mata ne Shivaji Maharaj jaise sher paida kiye jinhone fir se Bhagwa lehra diya. Mit gaye Hinduo ko mitane wale.

Yeh character ko jiya hai yarr ranveer ne
Combat Archers never used to aim or hold as it creates tension in body plus chaos of war never gives enough time.<br>Also stance is wrong and elbows are low means hands are trying to do hard labour which means arrow will hardly reach the target.<br>Director needed to have better knowlegE
Bahubali is best

searching for ssr
I don&#39;t understand the whole movie was filled with dialogues to eliminate the Mughal Empire but they didn&#39;t show anything like that. The end of the movie was great but I thought it would be kind of war between Marathas and Mughals. I mean if the climax of the movie isn&#39;t concerned about the Mughal then why you just brought it up for no reason.
Bad acting for ranveer singh
Bekar movie...  Third class
संजय लीला Bansali अफलातून फिल्म मेकर.एक एक शाँट उनका बहतरीन होता है ।
No,<br>Bajirao has to prove himself to become Peshwa not Ranveer. 🤦

Mughal was great and always will be. Read history and you will understand who  helps india to grow and make it strong against enemies.Maratha  used to rob there own people for money.Real enemy of india was maratha not mughals .
Jay shivray
it should be like this Cheeteh ki chaal Baj ki nazar aur Bajiro ke bow and arrow pe sandeh nahi karte...lolz

Great scene...watched many times
Shahu is only 38 yrs old in 1720. Here in this movie he looks like above 50
Bajirao missed the arrow<br>The whole darbar:😩<br>The maharaj himself:😩<br>The opponent:😏<br>Me:😶
Marathas freed INDIA from ISLAMIC Mughal Rule .It&#39;s Similar with Russians freeing Southern Europe from ISLAMIC Ottoman Rule .

Maratha Empire at its zenith. May be because they went beyond boundaries with global view in mind. <br>A lesson for today&#39;s india. Businesses needs to go global and   just like what the China did.
This one scene speaks the volume about this movie. May be the best one in recent times.
He was such a great warrior fought for truth against people who used to kill people because they were hindu but those reality is never shows
He is so much like me :-D
snajay leela bansali, rajkumar irani, ss rajamouli . undoubtedly the finest directors of Indian cinemas.
Kitna overacting karta hai Ranveer.
I born in brahmin family and now I deleted the word brahmin from my mind and now I&#39;m just hindu...   Jiye ga bhi mare ga bhi hindutat..... Tere liye
One of the finest entry scenes of world cinema.

Our greatest warriors, born out of this soil...Samudragupta, Chandragupta, Shivaji, Bajirao .....have always been ignored by our History books, but Invaders(Mughals..others) who only destroyed Hindu temples and made mosques over them are celebrated by our History books!! How long should we deal with lies......

Voice is not good of ranveer without voice dialogue has no meaning
Bajirao peshwa was one of the greatest personality in Indian history.
panipat may ranveer ko huna chahiya tha like kar bhai log
Arjun Kapoor should learn from Ranvir Singh.
A man who fought innumerable battles and wars and lost none...... But bollywood idiots reduced his legend to a love story...
Sikhs, Marathas, Ahoms and Maharana Pratap were the ones who fought against Mughal tyrants
Ranveers acting is greatst
Great maratha

Jai Bajirao Peshwa
<b>James Grant Duff in his &quot;History of Mahrattas&quot;:</b><br><i>It may be truly said that, Bajirao had both, head to plan and hand to execute.</i><br><br><b>Jadunath Sarkar says in his forward to “Peshwa Bajirao I and Maratha Expansion”</b><br><br><i>“Bajirao was a heaven born cavalry leader. In the long and distinguished galaxy of Peshwas, Bajirao Ballal was unequalled for the daring and originality of his genius and the volume and value of his achievements. He was truly a carlylean Hero as king- or rather as Man of action.’ If Sir Robert Walpole created the unchallengeable position of the Prime Minister in the unwritten constitution of England, Bajirao created the same institution in the Maratha Raj at exactly the same time.</i><br><br><b>Sir R. Temple says in “Oriental Experiences”:</b><br><br><i>“Bajirao was hardly to be surpassed as a rider and was ever forward in action, eager to expose himself under fire if the affair was arduous. He was inured to fatigue and prided himself on enduring the same hardships as his soldiers and sharing their scanty fare. He was moved by an ardour for success in national undertakings by a patriotic confidence in the Hindu cause as against its old enemies, the Muhammadans and its new rivals, the Europeans then rising above the political horizon. He lived to seethe Maratha spread over the Indian continent from the Arabian sea to the Bay of Bengal. He died as he lived in camp under canvas among his men and </i><b><i>he is remembered among the Marathas as the fighting Peshwa, as the incarnation of Hindu energy.</i></b><br><br><b>British General Bernerd Montgomery in his </b><b><i>Concise History of Warfare</i></b><b> :</b><br><br><i>They(Marathas) were at their best in the eighteenth century, and the Palkhed campaign of 1727-28 in which Baji Rao I outgeneralled Nizam-ul-Mulk, is a </i><b><i>masterpiece of strategic mobility.</i></b><br><br><br><br><b>Shreemant Peshwa Bajirao Ballal Bhat🙏🙏</b><br><br>The Undefeated Maratha Warrior 💪💪

hindustan ki mitti par dono hindu aur musilman ka haq. Musilman badshao ne kaafi zulm kiye hai magar itihaas ke ghatna ki saza aj hum apne desh vasio ko nahi de sakte. Humari sanskriti aur sabhiyata faras ki tehzeeb se aur nikhar gayi hai jaise humara urdu shabdo ka istamal karna apni zuban mein.

Tanhaji and Bajirao Mastani are the best movies in this genre.
Watch his marathi ascent.
Hota yahi aaya hai aage bhi hoga har Kshatriya ke liye ek Brahman guru hota hai

Is movie me ranveer ne acting ka Jo criteria set Kiya hai use 1000 years Tak koi hila nhi paayega
Chite ki chaal or baaz ki tez nazar 😂😂🤣🤣
I dont know why everyone sings prasies for Ranveer he was acting like a child nodding head and saying stupid dialogues like cheete ki chaal and stuff him turning 180😂. Peshwa Bajirao was a great warrior why should a great warrior be potrayed by such a childish actor
Ranveer song was the best actor
one of the most powerful scene
Kitabo se gayab ye sab kyu ??
This Man Peshwa Baji Rao, never got the true credit in history and its sad. Shivaji and Peshwa Bajirao, the two greatest Marathas ever born were the true architects of Maharashtra and Marathi culture. Shivaji made it strong and Baji Rao spreads in entire India. Shivaji Raje did get his credit in history but Baji Rao did not get it. It&#39;s high time we should make this man famous.
Like For 2020

Bajirao not Ranveer Singh write title properly
Ranveer the ganja Loda
Jay shivaji...
Not ranveer but bajirao had to prove to become peshwa 😁😁
Medieval India was such an epitome of power. Such grace and royalty, sadly it broke down...🙃
who actor in panipat is not suitable guys hnna😏
then their is arjun kapoor.....
Balaji bajirao- the fighting peshwa❤️
I highly doubt if the Chhatrapatis were living this lavishly
Fabulous entry

Everyone is awestruck by Ranveers acting but Mahesh Manjrekar did a good job in this scene as well.
Great actor

Bajirao 1 one of the greatest warriors the world has ever seen, he won nearly entire indiand stamped the authority of maratha and Hindu swaraj on Indian region, mughals and nizam  were threatened of bajirao, he didn&#39;t lose a single battle in his entire career.  We as Indians are blessed to have warriors like bajirao peshwa..
Jay Shivray 🚩
BAJIRAO.. KI JAY
Lol too late Ahmad Shah Abdali came to India 17 times if you guys did have any true warriors he would have been stopped the very first time he came and not go and come back 17x.
Don&#39;t present wrong history. Mughals was ruled on marathas and all india.😎
Yhi acting panipat me hoti to.....just imagin
The deeper politics/conspiracy might have been this : Bajirao and &#39;his&#39; team already knew about the test. So while placing the feather, the broken part might also have been added. &quot;Pehle se thora chota hai&quot; is just a distraction to convince people, similar to any magician&#39;s trick. He still needed to show his prowess by hitting the clay which he did. While everyone gasps at something spectacular, a smart guy simply steals the show with his talent.
Thoko like

Excellent introduction scene of Bajirao. Outstanding performance by Ranveer. He lived in the character.

Change the title to Bajirao has to prove...
Career best...
Arjun has to see ranveer performance
No1 can beat Sanjay leela bansali flims.. Looks very original
My only question  is why this scene is so epic?
सर्व युद्ध हे ग्रामीण शेतकरी मझुर आदिवासी यांनीच लढले आहे ...कोणताही राजा महान नव्हता किवा तक्त्वान नव्हता ...जसे की आता राजा भारताचा मोदी आहे पूर्वी मनमोहन होते ,याचा अर्थ असा नाही की तेच पूर्ण भारतात हुशार/ तक्त्वान आहे .त्यांच्या सारखे खूप आहे ...पण इतिहास हा मोदी मनमोहन राहुल यांच्याच बनणार आहे

Peshwa are Pradhan and Chhatrapati are king of Maratha Empire .someone are saying Peshwa are king.peshwa is a post given by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj which is 2nd most important post after king.their are many Peshwa during the life of Chhatrapati Shivaji and Sambhaji maharaj.bajirao was Pradhan not king.
the epic line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqTLr_hviPs&amp;t=92">1:32</a>

If Sanjay Leela Bhansali Sir was directing Panipat then it would have been Ranveer Singh in lead role
SLB has Masterfully directed this scene.  Phenomenal

How can one bear Arjun Kapoor for 3 hours after having watched such a masterclass from Ranveer!

Hindu rashtra reloaded.
if we had won the battle of Panipat , Satara/Pune would have been the Capital of India.
Jai peswa muglo ki gand mari
Imagine ARJUN KAPOOR in this scene 🙂
after getting hangover with panipat and refreshed my mind.. thank you ranveer all the best for kapil dev movie
who is script writter
ranveer&#39;s maharathi accent  very perfect....
I am damn sure This scene is way better than arjun kapoor whole performance in Panipat...😂😂😂
Bsdike Arjun Kapoor ise kehte h acting, maratha accent aur great maratha character play krna, accent, body language Dekho perfect..Arjun bhadwe
After Panipat trailer...?😝
It&#39;s not Ranveer who had to prove. It was the great Bajirao Ballal who proved himself. And it was the great Chhatrapati Shahu who picked this young gem from amongst very capable generals.
Panipat ke baad mood theek karne aya hu
पेशवा यानी ब्राह्मण शासन ने दलितों और पिछड़ों पर कितना जुल्म ढाया था कि वे अंग्रेजी हुकूमत से मिलकर निजात पाना चाहते थे। <br>🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳इसी पेशवा राजा ने शिवाजी के खिलाफ मुगलों का साथ दिया था।
Punjabi Ranveer did Marathi accent with so much perfection...
बाजीराव सारखा योद्धा परत होणे नाही <br>जय शिवराय
Detoxification after watching panipat trailer 🤪🤪🤪
Panipat dekh k mood off ho gya tha, mood teek krne aaya hu.<br><br>Now feeling great !
Who is here after Supreme Court&#39;s judgement
