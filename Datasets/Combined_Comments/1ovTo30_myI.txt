I can’t believe nobody was sheltering in the restrooms or the basement! And it amazes me how calm everyone was.
Absolutely terrifying. Amazing how quickly things can go from &quot;Oh my, my flight is delayed&quot; to &quot;My LIFE is in danger&quot;! Tornadoes are nothing to mess with!
This is why Denver Airport much better with tornadoes, they warn you in advance then they put everyone in storm shelters scattered around the airport
You ruined the video.
The weather experts at the airport really dropped the ball on this one. lol  Didn&#39;t even see it coming.  Not an alarm to be seen or heard.
stay off my back <br>&quot;Ураган&quot; накрыл Полесье (Hurricane in Polesye: Multiple Rocket Launcher &quot;Uragan&quot; Firing)<br>i was attacked 1986=1990 stankeviicus murder SO NOW I CAN USE WEATHER TECH CCCP SAMBO VS NATO!!!<br>leonardo attakced by bear REVENANT
I was born when this was happening. For the people that are from St. Louis, let’s be honest, we are used to it now.
I&#39;ll never forget that night. That monster destroyed the subdivision behind our house and the subdivision across the street from our house in Maryland Heights. It basically jumped right over McKelvey Road and tore through Bridgeton before heading down I-70 to the airport.
I wanted the Asain man to stand up and scream Godddd zilllka
Dang It Like Hurricane Katrina
the way that dude threw up tho
That one dude that grabbed his bag and left in the beginning was fast thinking before it hit
Not a single warning...
If the windows start bending from the intense wind, it means bad.
That old man is like.. aww hell this ain’t nothing.. I did 3 tours in Vietnam. 💣 🔥 🧨 Shiiiittt…
My question is where was the warning system thst usually warns you to seek shelter
&quot;yea sure 😃&quot; <br><br>Said the most calm man in history 🤣
Comment section older than my sister
My question is why didn&#39;t the tower alert anyone?
I firmly believe George is the only one in this video who lives in St. Louis
The old man probably had the same isea about death as my dad....my dad feared nothing he said not a damn u can do to defy death when its ur time its ur time.....no need to be afraid of anything
Cool, right about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=62">1:02</a> you can see the window glass starting to move in and out! That lady had the right idea. I&#39;m out!
That&#39;s amazing
What&#39;s even scarier is how dark it is out there, and you have no idea when or where it&#39;s going to hit until everything starts hitting the window.
I’m surprised the electricity still worked
“George!  You alright?”<br>“Yeah, sure. [Duh!]”. <br><br>Lol!  Went back to his seat within 10 seconds.
Tornado: <i>In the process of engulfing the airport.</i><br><br>The people standing by the windows: <b>&quot;This is fine.&quot;</b>
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=60">1:00</a> you can see the reflection bending and warping as the glass bulges from the air pressure
So…no warning!? WTH
Where are your masks anyway .hello people
Under chairs
Hit the floor
I would never fly into or out ofvthere
Tornado land people
Why do you live we there.. no way
Raw footage, my ass.
How come the TV’s weren’t on telling them a tornado was in the area? <br>That is usually how people are notified in Missouri. <br>I would think the airport officials would know the weather too and warn the people to get away from windows.
Holy moly. No warning. Glad you are okay.
I know that it&#39;s been 10 years but, why didn&#39;t the airport give a tornado warning for the people waiting inside?
Good thing that girl moved!! All the windows blew out where she was sitting!!
Nobody realise something what is that fume cloud in the airport i hav ed my theory the guy vomithing me i think that fume its probably chemtrails
So pal, how does shit become holy? And man furthers his level of intelligent vocabulary.
George you all right?<br><br>Yeah sure.<br><br>Idk if they are leaving from st louis or going back home, but this was the most st louisan conversation if ive ever heard one 😂
“Wow, I Just Saw That… Hit…”<br>His brain: <i>”That Lightning… Did I See Something Behind It???”</i><br>The Weather: <del>Yup… Now Run You Puny Human!</del>
in hind sight, lambert gets hit with tornadoes frequently, so i don’t think making the airport practically out of metal and windows was a smart idea
That old guy was thinking what the hell is going on here? I&#39;d rather die than get up out of this chair.
C-10 was the place to be or not
As bad as it was, 5 days after this EF4 tornado, 11 EF4s and 4 EF5s would touch down within the span of a few hours across the southern US in an outbreak later known as the 2011 Super Outbreak.
Oh jeeze! VERY scary!😱😬
George on his phone….”oh it’s just a tornado let me know if it comes back”😂
The whistling from the tornado…. Love it
I think your flight is cancelled
Are you ok?<br><br>Yeah, sure!<br><br>This wasn&#39;t that guys first storm
kathryn :jeff be qiet!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfdK6H9d6J0&amp;t=154">https://youtu.be/EfdK6H9d6J0?t=154</a> <b>speker sounds blaring</b>
this i remmeber vividly it was a day after my birthday and it threw my whole trampoline acroos kings highway and our jetskies
if i was there’s i would record
Me watching this is 2021 confused as to why no one’s wearing masks and then remembering😂😩
To bad that they didn’t have masks on 😂
Ho shit man
He perfectly started recording on time as if he knew that the tornado 🌪 was coming
I love how after ENTIRE WINDOWS BROKE AND THINGS WENT EVERYWHERE, everyone is like am man I gotta go pee let me finish my game first.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=68">1:08</a> Did I just hear another woman shouting &quot;Run, run!&quot; while the girl sitting down wisely made a run for it?
&quot;Yeah, sure!&quot;
Yeah let’s all watch tornado outside window then freak out when it’s time to evacuate building.   People are dumb
I feel so bad for all those tarmac workers
Just saw that and just sits there... This is why natural selection is a thing.
You can literally hear it before the Windows shatter
I love how the first words he says after getting hit is &quot;WOW, look at the plane! &quot; 😂
Windows are the worst place to be during a tornado.<br><br>Tornadoes really really enjoy throwing stuff, basically. Even planes. You don&#39;t want to be next to a window when it does.
I think I speak for everyone here when I say we&#39;re glad George was all right.
If I was in that part I would be screaming and crying luckily I live in england
This guy filming sounds just like me when I record shit. Who else sings as they&#39;re narrating lol
How dare you make sure you were okay over the quality of the video! On a real note, that looked crazy holy crap!
We saw nothing but aftermath.  Out of cinematic integrity you should have risked your life for a good shot.
...................OH MY GOD?!
Holy shit, indeed.
Wow! When people say tornadoes sound like train when they hit, I know what they mean now lol.
Woah. And people are still there and no commotion?! How about immediately evacuating that part of (if not all of) the terminal?!?!
Yeah... When I see that thick paned glass start to bow in like that....TIME TO RUN!! Lol
Absolutely ass weather crew on standby that day. Nobody was monitoring the weather they had plenty of warning on that cell and yet non of the planes or terminals had been evacuated.
&quot;George you alright?&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;Yeah sure it&#39;s just a tornado&quot;
Plane: oh hey guys uhh nice protection you got there
Old guy on phone, like nothing is happening.
Tornadoes are just absolutely the worst. I call them the devil&#39;s wind.
That&#39;s like one of the most scary things ever!!!!!!!!!!
That woman in front of the windows woke up at the right time!
ngl I laughed at it thinking how much it relates to how 2020 has gone...
This is some creepy footage. It&#39;s Missouri; the airport had no warning this was coming? Why weren&#39;t these people away from the windows and whatnot? This is an extreme example of being unorganized for warning plans.
That Women next to the window got up just in time
HORRIFYING HOW THAT RUMBLING RAMPS UP
god damn that would be scary
Holy shit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=97">1:37</a> look at 1 of the windows. Is that fire?
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=55">0:55</a> my phone went off the same time the lightning struck and it gave me a heart attack
Old guy is a Vietnam Vet. He has seen and lived through way worse.
I legit can&#39;t remember what the STL airport looks like I haven&#39;t been there in so long
That whistle caused by the terminal structure is kinda haunting ngl
He was right tho. That plane could’ve been leaking fuel and exploded. The smart idea would be to hurry up and get away.
The thing is, you would think the airport personnel would be able to warn people of a tornado. They&#39;re constantly monitoring weather, but choose to ignore a tornado heading right towards the airport?
I wonder if the dude is from CA? Bc i too would instinctively hide under a chair and cover my face if shit started rumbling like that (its what you do for earthquakes)
The old guy sitting there on his phone.. &quot;Hold my beer&quot;
Not me brother. Not flying in wind shear
that girl at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=69">1:09</a> could have died if she didn’t move
Why TF would u..... Block ugh
I wasn’t in the airport when this happened but, we were hit pretty hard in Evansville, IN. It was crazy. The house I was staying in was damaged by the tornado that hit STL airport that day.
The man with the tan hat is just so calm, as if oh it&#39;s a tornado we&#39;ll be fine, let me just text my wife and tell her I&#39;ll be late!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<br>Imagine this....,...........<br>Guy recording: look at that plane it&#39;s flying through the air😨<br>Old man: that&#39;s what their supposed to do😕
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=55">0:55</a> Lightning bolt: Hey if anyone sees me, I just want to warn you to get out of your seats because a tornado is on it&#39;s way, and I don&#39;t want y&#39;all to get hurt
How to clear the boarding line in a hurry
See the old guy, he didn&#39;t even budge..sat right there in his own world..
When it hit you started filming the floor?!? Wow!
That guy on his phone is my new spirit creature.<br>Anything happens and I likley dont care.
Half of airport exists after tornado hits<br>&quot;George are you alright!?&quot;<br>George: <b>&quot;Yeah sure!&quot;</b>
I can&#39;t even believe this! No warnings....that plane with people in it....they had to know this was happening. Hope all were ok.
Everybody gangsta till the windows start warping
I spend an exchange year in Saint Louis, I witnessed one thunder storm during my stay there and it wa slime nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before.
Let’s just give him props for finding horizontally
Windows shattered, people screaming and he says &quot;wow look at the plane 🤨&quot;
Waiting to get on the plane
George is goals lol
God Bless Them!
The big thumb saved me
Tornado: I am a terrifying force of nature<br>Old guy on phone: k
Dude next to you is just plain ready to die man...
You can tell who lives in the Midwest and South and who doesn’t.
Bruh how’d it get pass TSA
Why wouldn’t an airport warn the people of a tornado warning? They know current weather conditions better than most.
Nice of them to warn the poor passengers waiting for their flight! They are damn lucky that they didn’t fly without using an airplane!, If that was me I would sue the hell out of that airport for not warning the passengers that a tornado was about to strike! How incompetent are they?
Did that Asian man get out cause if he didn’t Thas on him🤷🏿‍♂️
How was there not a warning announcement over the intercom system?!
wow
airport windows:<br><b>let me introduce my good pal, mother nature</b>
...
this is my brain when I see a droplet of rain
Let&#39;s just all agree whoever that old man was texting must be hella important. He didn&#39;t even look up
Sadly there was the reflection in the window
Am i the only one? Who obsessed in actual disaster footage
Tornadoes are scary as hell
Thank god your thumb was there to protect us
When the window you&#39;re watching starts to feckin&#39; STRETCH, ye&#39;d best begone...
I am so glad everybody’s OK🙏🏻 God bless🎚
Raw footage of... a guy&#39;s thumb on the camera lens. <br>Downvoted for clickbait title
Sorry..But all I saw was the guy&#39;s thumb ovr the cel pho cam lense durng the time frame of tornado..
The guy facing you was like...y’all hear sum?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=69">1:09</a> She dipped.
I love George 😂😂
Dude literally hid behind the bench he was sitting on
The best thing is nobody died in that airport
All; waiting waiting waiting<br><br><br>Tornado: are you waiting for me or not?
My ass would be in the bathroom
Am I the only one who has not been in a tornado or anything severe except for the 7.0 earthquake in Ancourage,Alaska in November
Hope everyone was ok. Lmao George get your butt up and move
The poor old man on the phone while getting hit by the tornado
How is every body calm<br><br><br><br><br>We r use to it it&#39;s Oklahoma
George&#39;s response of &quot;Yeah, sure&quot; was hilarious. His calm demeanor is how I wish I could be during the tornados in my own life! 🌪
The fuck windows almost getting sucked out whilst the woman sits there oblivious to what’s going on
allahu akbar
We are Tornado of Borg.<br>You are irrelevant.<br>Your shit will be spatially redistributed.
This could be an ad for cell phone addiction awareness
Oh my goodness!
You had one job
This video was so weird to see. One moment he&#39;s filming the seemingly normal airport. Theres a thumb, and then next thing I see the people are gone and the windows are shattered
Oh I wanted to see people flying like a bird🤗
Midwestern lets for ya
Well we know george is alright
The older man on the phone is giving zero fucks about everything going on around him 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=85">1:25</a>
&quot;Wow, i just saw that!&quot;<br>Tornado: you wanna see more?
Old man sitting still on his phone just thinking what bunch of pussies
The old man didn’t even budge !!! Lol 😂😂.. still going about his evening .. texting !!! Omg lol .
I bet George is a farmer.
Old man jus stays in his chair lmao
Excellent economy treatment
Old guy wants to finish his video before he moves, lol
Its funny how people who don&#39;t live down south are so nonchelont about tornados...we hall ass beforehand here in Texas..unless you&#39;re sleep..lol
<b>Roblox: survive the disasters</b>
Old dude still chillin, texting 😂😂😂😂
Every one running for their life <br>And this guy wow wow
Omg 😮
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=113">1:53</a><br>I don&#39;t think enough can be said about how much of a straight savage George is..!! I&#39;ve seen storm chasers freak out in situations like this..And they even had more warning..😮
George you alright? <br><br>No I broke my freaking leg call the doctor!!
Hahaha not to be awkward but who wanna get up first? XD!!!!!
Hope they increased security at the airport after that. <br>This is what happens when you just let any old tornado wander within airport boundaries.
Best view of a thumb ever
Hey St. Louis Airport, nice tornado warning system you’ve got, you fucking assholes!
I just seen a finger is fine the finger?
If you look at the windows, you can see them start to flex right before the debris starting hitting.
DID GEORGE EVEN MOVE LOL
Lousy airport, no emergency plan. warning sirens,no direction, no authority&#39;s directing,they who run the place knew a storm was likely and on the way
Is that Lambert airport in st. Louis
how come airport personnel didnt move people to an adequate place knwoing they were under a tornado warning unless the tornado formed right above the airport
More comp cases
God’s telling you not to fly.
That guy still sitting, not even giving a damn about a tornado.
That shit came out of nowhere!
Everyone is scrambling to get their stuff while freaking out and this one guy is just in a chair playing on his phone like hes been hit by a tornado before. badass
Old man George ain&#39;t scared of NOTHIN&#39;.
This is not George’s first tornado
La vida puede cambiar en un minuto 🤷🏻‍♀️ esto es una prueba de ello
Just a little lightning storm
All I can see is his thumb
I am currently writing a paper on Airport Safety during Tornadoes, I plan to use this video to show there was no warning before the tornado hit. It&#39;s clear that the staff and passengers were unaware of the danger. Great Video, thank you.
Oooh fun
It&#39;s karma for all americas bullying to other countrys its the lords way of saying ur doomed
I remember that. You guys alright? Hopefully there were no casualties
Sooo...I guess y’all canceling my flight?
Should be called &quot;a guys thumb while tornado hitting concourse&quot;.
I hope no planes weren&#39;t taking off
Your finger blocked...why post it?
Gorge you alright yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa of corce
Lol... So much for &quot;filming it&quot; with your hand.
1% of comments are about the tornado <br>99% of comments are about gorege having balls of steel
George doesn&#39;t give a fuck
‘Wow, look at the plane!’ He said, with his thumb over the damn camera!!!
holy shit.<br><br><br><br><br><br>what about the animals in the cages
<b>entire airport&#39;s windows blow out like purulent boils</b><br><br>travelers: &quot;great, not AGAIN&quot;
I would’ve pissed myself. Holy shit.
St Louis Lambert International Airport. <br>Once the 6th busiest airport in the nation with 33,000,000 passenger movements per year.  <br>I remember in the 1990s watching the planes stacked and circling waiting to land at night.<br>Thanks to that damn Carl Ican it&#39;s a mere shadow of its former glory.
The worst part is they missed the connecting flight
The airport is the worse place to be in a strong tornado, <br>Planes standing around: People taking to flight on other ways -- devoid of an aircraft.<br>People wondering if planes will <b>catch them!</b><br>With objects hurtling as flights are canceled. <br>Prayers hoisted to the heavens wondering if He will hear.   <br>Whilst making our new life&#39;s resolution to be better, more charitable and dear. <br>Faith, love, and charity are never too late; so it may seem, <br>Especially when we are too late to repent. May that not be seen.
Holy Shit. I commend you for staying so calm...George too, shit you’d think he was at a pub drinking a whiskey drink or lager drink singing songs about the good times. Cool Calm George, Jorge or Jörje! 🤣
I was there!
THIS is one of the most BORING AND STUPID videos I&#39;ve ever seen.👎🖓
“George you alright?”<br><br>“Yeah, Sure!”<br><br>That was the whitest response ever😂
you say look at the plane, yet you can&#39;t even video it. so unprofessional! lol
George is a legend
Your..............thumb.................................RUINED THE ENTIRE VIDEO.  NEXT TIME YOU FILM A TORNADO, GET YOUR FREAKING THUMB OUT OF THE LENS.
Was that an act of God?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=67">1:07</a> me leaving the house when I’m late for the bus
Wow!! This is TERRIFYING!!!
if you listen really close wit the volume turned up you hear a Black Guy say “ Oh Shit “ and that’s when the storm broke through <br><br>And thank the Black Guy for saving everyone’s life if it wasn’t for him yelling Oh Shit it woulda been tragic
Little do you know George was actually the reason the plane went down...
George was like &quot;back when I was in Nam planes were crashing everywhere all throughout the night! Toughen up you pussy!&quot; &quot;Now let me keep watching porn on my phone and dont bother me until our planes ready!&quot;
<b>Tornado Hits</b><br>St. Louis Airport PA: John Smith, please pick up the white courtesy phone.
I was there when this storm came thru. I happened to be taking a dump when it hit the fan. There wasn&#39;t any general announcement of a tornado warning beforehand, just a general tornado watch. If I remember correctly, the funnel had just touched down outside the airport a mile away, and weather radars picked up on it just as this was happening.<br><br>Of course, I was fairly constipated at the time, so I may have missed any tornado warning announcements while I was focused on the business at hand.
Wtf
That was just one of the pilots pulling a prank, I was in the jet when he announced over the intercom that he was now facing his engines into the lobby, where the business man who cursed him out earlier was lounging and all I remember is we were taking off seconds later!
When the action really happens he just films his thumb.
But that old man with the beard sat there didn&#39;t move and  continued to text...lol ,😂😂
How come we didn&#39;t hear any tornado sirens go off
Why was he videoing in the first place?
Awesome thumb shot.there wasn&#39;t really much to see.  I call clickbait.
Oh my imagine if this happened to me
I&#39;m guessing that was an F3 thumb...
Wish we could have seen it. Please go to another airport that&#39;s having a tornado and film it the right way this time.
And you old friend continued to keep texting thru the whole incident,lol
Not much to see here. When the tornado &quot;hits,&quot; you can&#39;t even tell what&#39;s going on. Oh course, I realize the person videoing this had to consider safety first. I would have done the same. But with that being said, there&#39;s really nothing much to see other than the approach and the aftermath.
I love how that old guy was still sitting in his seat playing on his phone like nothing happened, lol.
How in the Hell is there no take cover announcement at an international airport?! At Sky Harbor they’re telling you to drink water if it’s hot outside
Too bad we didn’t see any of it but understand you covering your face.
That gurl in the front said nah u got me fucked up and dipped
Raw Footage Of A Recording Of A Hand 🖐
I would of just been sitting there like well that happened
George was in Nam
He sucks at filming
Damn☝️😋🧸 what are you resustating  your finger 🍻
George, are you alright? ｙｅａｈｓｕｒｅ
At least George is alright...
U destroyed the whole footage
eerie
Poor kids , and crazy weather and good your safe bro
Poor kids , and crazy weather and good your safe bro
Holy fu** lol
Chuck Norris retired and left George in charge! We are all going to be alright........
some final destination type shit
The guy with the beard just sat there on his phone: <br><br>He protec<br>He attac<br>But most importantly... he text back
They&#39;re all lucky they weren&#39;t on the plane!
Turbulence at zero feet; The movie.
Weak. Camera guy sucks.
I&#39;m glad that girl got out of the way before the glass broke
Good thing you put your thumb to block the horror!!!🙄😑
So you witnessed a dangerous situation approaching you and other people and instead of yelling for people to move you decided filming was more important? You&#39;re a jerk.
They continued service with that weather???? There was a tornado warning and these people were still waiting to get on the aircraft? We&#39;ve canceled flights for less than that before...
Better learn how to use a camera.
Way to miss the whole thing
FYI you want to start watching around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=50">0:50</a>
Did this dude know it was gonna hit causeee why was he recording.. Waiting for something to happen
Nobody screams???
George didn’t care
Why was that guy puking?
Guy in grunt hat couldn’t give to @hits lol 😆
Poor camera control
Old man gave zerofucks
Aw the man holding his son my hearth sank
Hate people who dont follow through on recording the beginning and only the aftermath.......lololololololol
<b>I just hope everyone is alright! I&#39;d feel really bad if there were older people there that didn&#39;t make it...</b> 😭😭😭😭😭
Bippity boppity boo the moment you are looking for starts around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=62">1:02</a> 🙂
I&#39;m confused,  did the airport not know about the tornado? They have advanced weather equipment because they have to monitor the flights. I understand it was dark but I don&#39;t understand how they didn&#39;t detect a weather anomaly and make an announcement and get people to take cover and stay away from the windows.
Thank you by the way for showing us how life is really short. We should be more aware of what&#39;s really going on around us you were  spot on with this video. Recording like this just another day but truly It could have been a day, We would have had never seen before. God was there ☺️
Robot speaker turns on sorry no flights don&#39;t know when don&#39;t know what time Don&#39;t know nothing have a nice day, while everyone is 🏃 for their lives.  Except the ones on the phones.
O M G Wow!!
Why are they not brought to a safe area
Dude dry heeving, really you pussy....!!!!  If there was blood &amp; dead bodies maybe but not broken windows..
Girl <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=69">1:09</a> must be from Hong kong or Taiwan :) good instincts on tornado
No announcement to leave all things behind and take cover in the restrooms? Restrooms are the tornado bunkers at the airport.
It’s a good thing that you covered the camera the whole time. If we’d actually seen it, that would’ve been too scary ...
I love George
Great, I saw an arm
Next time let goerge record the video!!
Legend has it, that old dude is still sitting and sending that text to this day.
less hands covering the camera next time ....
I heard the horror tornado gets hitting something around the airport. That&#39;s a creepy tornado, right?
God that atrocious carpet. Disgusting.
All I saw was a fucking thumb/ nothing horrible camera man
They weren&#39;t aware that a tornado was coming?!!
Tell me did the plane got sucked
The howling noise is scary
Oh wow that was some amazing raw footage of some dudes finger!
That&#39;s a little close for comfort
That was scary.
They are okay?
How&#39;d the airline not tell people???
George you alright &quot;yeah sure&quot; lol anymore chill he&#39;d be liquid haha
Almost 1 k
That indian guy have survival insect left second before it hits
Legend says that man is still sitting there texting to this very day.
Why TF is no one where they should be?  Oh nothing is going on just a FKN TORNADO!! HOLY FUCK St Louis sucks.
That&#39;s some final destination shit right there....
Wow, this dude managed to get absolutely zero footage. What a waste.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=65">1:05</a>
Continuing the proud YouTube tradition of pointing the camera in some random direction away from the money shot.
SHE WAS OUTTA THERE !!!! thank god !!!
This reminds me of that scene in Final Destination when the windows of the airport shatters after the airplane explodes.
Me: “Hey George, You alright?”<br>George:”Yeah Sure”
great camera work
Crap video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=67">1:07</a> Chinese’s dude: Back in China we don’t have tornadoes, we only have communism.<br><br>Everyone else:
that whistling sound is horrifying
Lady: &quot;Shit im out.&quot;
Omg i hate people that can&#39;t film shit
No warning wtf
Great missed everything cause you pointed the damn thing to you&#39;re crotch, damn moron. Waste of time.
That old guy just chillin in the chair next to got me dead
OML I WAS THERE THAT DAY I WAS RIGHT BY YOU REALLY U WERE WHEREIN A GRAY GREEN SHIRT YOU HAVE BROWN HAIR U WERE RECORDING ON UR PHONE THAT HAD A BLACK CASE😱😱😱
Im so thankful we dont have tornados in scotland. Ive been both facisnated and terrified of them since i watched the film twister as a young girl lol
Seeing those windows bend in and out is terrifying😩 that must have been insane. The lady was smart to move when she did
that  was  just  genus  recording  with  ur  thumb  over  the  lens  so  we  couldn&#39;t  see  anything
Can you send me pictures of the plane
So where&#39;s the video of it hitting?? All I saw was a thumb!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=129">2:09</a> “oof”
Holy fuck!
Was that old man with the green hat a real human or a statue?  He didn’t even move. 😂😂😂.   Luckily they all made it.  Strong structure.
Be good if you actually filmed it😀
Hey, fumble fingers, why&#39;d you EVEN post this?  Idiot.
WHAT THE FUCK???!!! 😵😵😵😵 WAS THAT????
No, I&#39;m not flying today!
That&#39;s crazy!!!!
I was there. No warning from airport staff. No sirens. One terminal over all the windows blew out and pelted everyone with glass. Personal we&#39;re slow to respond and assist. Airport is rebuilt and changes for the better have been made for safety from weather. The personal still need classes on kindness and support though. Great job filming. I was to scared to get a pic let alone video
The recording is pure shit tbh
That girl was like “nope, I’m out!”
George is definitely my mood
My farts have similar power.
the video wasn&#39;t worth showing...<br><br>dude covered the lens...<br><br>when the tornado hit...<br><br>I&#39;m only here for the comments
Oh you fucking idiot. You put the camera down right at the greatest part. Scared little bitch is still siting in the same chair too and the guy george next to you &quot;is just fine&quot; geez, what a waste man.
I missed the tornado cause I was thumb blocked
The only raw footage I see in most of this is some not so raw fingers.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=70">1:10</a> you can see the windows start to bend from the wind and pressure, these people were really lucky it was only a weak tornado.
WOW! That had to have been so scary! I hope everybody got through it safe and sound!
So Airports dont have sirens for warning people freaking crazy
1.6 million views of a thumb at the best moment👍🤦🏻‍♂️
Title is a little off, should be &quot;look at my pretty finger&quot;.
Martians did it 👽👽👽👽👽👽👾👾👾👾🤖🤖🤖🤖🤖👽👽👽👽👽💀
Where did the guy with the backpack go runnin off to?
Yeah..thanks for the thumb protection!!<br>📽👍🌀
I expected the Asian man to get sucked out of the roof when the tornado hit...loo
Damn
Older Guy still sitting there on his phone...lololololololol...didn&#39;t even move an inch the whole time!!!..lololololololol..probably a vietnam war vet..lol
I did not see it, so it did not happen...fake news.
You just know old Georgie boy has seen a few of those before. Lol
Wow lol
Michael J Fox recorded this
My feeling is as the twister passed over it lowered the air pressure enough that it  caused fuel to vent from the wing tanks of the plane. Yeah, best not to take that internally.
What a selfish man, he didnt even stay seated so we can see the windows blow out
Where are the warnings!!?? Gate agents? Airport?????? Hellloooo
What&#39;s so stupid is ppl standing around and gawking! Smdh
That must&#39;ve been scary. I&#39;m glad you guys are ok.
for some strange reason people &quot;think&quot; that they can believe a climatologist who predicts the weather 100 years in the future but sadly cannot actually predict the actual verifiable weather today. that is why they call it junk science, and the people who use it are &quot;political scientists&quot;.
Welcome to St Louis!!
Great video of your thumb
I guarantee you someone was bitching about flight delays after this.
Bet there was still someone complaining about the delay!
Wait... did that guy with the hat stay put?
I wonder if there are any airports that have a built in tornado siren...which would have been helpful for Lambert.
And you didn&#39;t even try to get out of the way. Dumbass.
So the airport...that has more radars then anyone...didn&#39;t see that weather coming in hey? hhmmm
You could have edited out the asian puking on his hand. That was absolutely disgusting! YUCK!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=55">0:55</a>
I wonder what the ramp agents did.
Reason two why I am no longer a Flight Attendant
that old man is like bye guys, I&#39;ll just stay here; I&#39;m in shock😅
Dam bro your camera skillls suckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Wow...its 2019 and this is in my recommend 🙄
You missed labeled the video. It should be named “Finger Over Camera Lense”
George you right?<br><br>Yeah sure
nice finger
Learn how to film jerk
Shitty reel dude. Man up and get the shot.
Storm where are you?
Look at that weak ass coughing, first time getting hands dirty. Or really scared, that would be some shit though.
Horrible filming... why even bother
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=119">1:59</a> not even a tornado will get that old fella off his phone. I wonder if he&#39;s playing Farmville ?
WOW !!!!!!!!
Definitely an F-6 hurricane on the Richter scale.
The old man is just chillin 😎
&quot;peoples bein killed from the fuckin ternaaaado&quot; -Dayton Family
What footage? Some fucktards fingerprint is footage??
It&#39;s like that girl sensed something and booked.
I applaud you for not panicking with en endless stream of OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG!!!!
Damn airport could have warned people of that storm...shit there control towers go by weather patterns
Awesome video of your finger!
Looked more like raw fingerage.
Stop putting videos on YouTube you f*<b>***</b> suck on recording
Please learn how to use a camera if you&#39;re going to post videos on YouTube. I actually felt a little bit dizzy after this, it was all over the place. And you put a finger over the lens for the crucial part! I would&#39;ve been too embarrassed to post that. Shoddy!!
Great close-up of your finger
How in the world could there have been no warning for this, especially at an airport?
thank God people got out of the way before it came through the window
You had 1 job to film
George is me when I realize that, if I die, I don’t have to pay student loans
Damn you think a airport would have a warning system.airhorns or something.
U live in st louis and this tornado almost destroy my house and a tree just spammed on my house.
I’ve been in two tornadoes— if it’s storming and your ears start popping, TIME TO GO
Did the airport not give you a heads up about a tornado getting ready to hit the airport??<br>You would think the weather Service would pass it on to the concourse gates .... for Safety reasons!!
Next time, get your fucking finger off the camera dude!!!   We don’t wanna see your finger.   Thumb down .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=67">1:07</a> That Girl moved fast😂😂😂
one&#39;s worst real-life nightmare.
I been there in that tornado that day
I guess you get to a certain age when no matter what could be happening around you, you&#39;re just like I don&#39;t give a f***! I&#39;m almost there.
Im ded
Scary, but endurable with a nice person like you around.
😨😨😱scaryyy
omg this is so fake<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>lol jk
That older guy just sat in his seat the whole time 🙄
JP5 Fuel ain’t no joke 👌
Oh the sound of it is so cool
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=119">1:59</a> Is he a robot? He was still sitting there texting like a breeze just blew pass.
GO GO GO
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=69">1:09</a> How did she know?
Those winds are signs from God to you Americans ... You must return to the right path respect people life, bow for only God not for money not for humans ...
Does this mean the flight is delayed?
I hear the glass destroyed
Talk about a garbage airport how can these idiots not announce there is a FUCKING tornado outside! Are they that stupid? I would never go there again! They have air traffic control for fucks sake how dumb are they.
Why didn&#39;t he just keep filming towards the window. Since he didn&#39;t move.
Can u like stay still when recording, or maybe keep the cam on what&#39;s going on
Yeah sure! 😂😂
uncle jed looked unphased didnt he. he was so focused on sending that text.
raw footage? more like garbage footage
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=66">1:06</a>
That lady knew shit was about to go down.<br>Badass like big ass bomb hit.
That guy threw up?
That’s so sad, I wonder if people in the plane died?
Me on the toilet after eating spicy foods
George my man!
All are so late !
All that time recording and didnt even manage to catch any of it
Something tells me that girl has experienced a tornado before. As soon as those windows started shaking she got up and ran the hell out of there.
Was the jet bridge on fire
Awesome video... Thanks for posting! I recorded a huge tornado and hail storm that happened last week at the same airport! Please please watch the video here! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJnbtQ0qb_4">https://youtu.be/SJnbtQ0qb_4</a>
Totally missed it when he put his phone down towards the ground. The 5 seconds of destruction. I don&#39;t blame him, but we missed when the tornado blew out the windows, etc.
Nice footage of your fucking thumb
Why didn&#39;t the terminal sound a warning to people in time for them to head for the restrooms?!  Surely they monitor the weather forecasts!
Why didn’t people go to the designated tornado shelter??  Every airport has at least one.
That poor man must&#39;ve been so scared to be throwing up like that
Great job blocking all the action.
lol, that woman&#39;s instinct served her well.
George is a fucking boss.
i love how every person that pulls out their phones to record something that they feel is about to happen, like a fight or a natural disaster, as soon as it starts happening they shove their phones up their ass or something and they dont record shit, you dint have your thumb in the way for a sec, it was for the whole thing you dint capture anything but aftermath so &quot;raw footage&quot; not so much
George is alright :)
OMGOODNESS ARE YOU ALL OK WOW THIS SHIT IS SCARY CRYS WOW
the action starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=63">1:03</a>
So he missed the 10 seconds we all wanted to see
Wow look at the plane<br><br>Where?<br><br>There right there<br><br>Ohh he flyi&#39;n😂
Not the best quality video, next time don&#39;t cover the camera you fool.
Super SD. Lovely.
Awwhh the Father shielding his son at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=105">1:45</a> 💜 Adorable
And YES , Im Alright...lol
gotta love the old man just sitting there chillin after it was over....everyone else is freaked out and hes just sittin relaxed like whats the big deal you pussies......he propably walked to school in tornadoes both ways with no shoes in the snow.
This gives me Final Destination vibes.
why do people cover up there cameras when something actually happens.  i&#39;ve never understood that.
We don&#39;t get tornadoes in Maine,  thank God
&quot;Holy shit look at the plane!&quot;<br><br>I wish I could have.
The sad thing is your government and businesses dont want us structural engineers to design (calculate) the buildings strong enough so they dont do that in tornadoes. We can, buy they want to have a failed structure so they can get more money from insurance claims. The business people in the engineering companies are the high paid and are the strength determinAtion without the liability. That was a minor whirl wind, it didnt take the plane so.less then 150 mph.
OMG, THATS SCARY‼️I live right in what they call Tornado Alley.  Kentucky has been hit so many times by tornadoes. I’ve actually witnessed two forming.  Really terrifying. Don’t mess with Mother Nature‼️
right when the fun happens he doesn&#39;t show it but yeah show the boring stuff  LOL !!!!!!!!!!!
Roughly 200,000 years ago we had very similar tech. Nature&#39;s a boss and knows when it&#39;s time to refresh. We&#39;re almost to that point. ;)
Denver airport has tornado shelters and they hardly ever get them. So surely this place has them too. So why the heck was everyone in front of the windows
I didn’t see shit other then his finger lol
That old guy really didn&#39;t wanna lose that game of fruit ninja.......
Scary
George don&#39;t give a fuck he been through it all 😂
this happened to George 6 times before, he&#39;s already at guest services trying to upgrade to first class for compensation
And then enters the king of monsters GODZILLA 😁😁😁
Two things that I thought were a bit unusual about this.....no warning, no screams. You&#39;d think a place that has very tall towers specifically designed to keep track of weather relating to the planes would see a tornado coming in time for a warning to everyone. Also, usually when you have a bunch of people in a disaster running around, there&#39;s all kinds of people screaming.
My favorite part of this is the guy reading a book acting like everyone around him is over-reacting, and then jumping up and freaking out
Estupido tapastes el lente.
You know this wasn’t George’s first rodeo😂
I dont get what happened??
Mother nature don&#39;t care for airports
my mom and i were there a few days before this happened. scary asf
George had a bit to drink to calm his nerves before the flight, thats my hot take.
it&#39;s weird how that lady in front of you reacts. Like she instantly goes from &quot;i&#39;m chillin&quot; to &quot;RUNNING FOR MY LIFE&quot; without any reaction or anything in between. It&#39;s like she didn&#39;t even see that there was a tornado, she just decided to run for no reason.
raw footage of a thumb while a tornado hits
I literally thought that said tornado hitting tanacon
That guy probably should’ve moved to a safer place in the building if the wind was strong enough to break the airports windows! The tornado could’ve sucked him right out the window!
that&#39;s insane people actually be living in places where there are tornados y&#39;all brave I could never
Nothing happened <b>videos the windows</b><br><br>Shit start happening <b>hides the camera</b><br><br>Humans🙄
Well that escalated quickly.
We all need a George.
George goes through this on a daily apparently.
Never be by windows during storms. Did no one know that it was gonna be that bad?
90% of the comments are about George and 10% about how lucky the woman was that she moved xD
i&#39;m so glad i live in cali and all we do is shake a lil every now and then and get covered in dust during 125 degree weather if take that over dodging tornados any day
George is fearless 😂
Was this actually in St. Louis
You didn&#39;t filmed it well
I am SO sick of people cussing on these tornado videos! Don&#39;t they know how to say anything else!
Someone farted real hard
raw footage of a thumb. well worth my time
More like footage of a thumb and some plastic and broken windows.
“Look at that plane!” <br><br>Ya, it’s flying without taking off!
did anyone else notice that guy on his phone completely ignoring the fact that there&#39;s a freaking tornado right out the window
The old guy is sitting there and is like ‘these damn kids are so soft’...
Anyone one that plane?<br>Rip
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=65">1:05</a> lady was like fuuuuck no XD
Everyone is so chill like this happens everyday
So many tornadoes are just like &quot;Bam!, I&#39;m here, your stuff is wrecked, and I&#39;m gone&quot; in like 15 seconds.
WOW 😮
and the whole time that one guy was sitting on his phone lol
Wow he didnt video record the most important part.. Wow just wow
<b>REESES PUFF! REESES PUFFS!</b>
I live hereeee
George you alright?  <br><br>George: why you filthy youtubers keep asking me?? I said yeah, sure.
We have a special announcement Your F-5 Aircraft has just landed. Will groups A and B please line up at the wind tunnel and thank you for flying One Way Airlines
Yeah, sure...
Well i think its safe to save...<br><br><br>The flight was canceled
Was that man sat at the sat there all the time.
I wanna grab a beer with George.
I saw a thumb.
was your flight delayed? lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=74">1:14</a>
George is a boss.
wow 2 tornadoes 2 days apart at the same airport. this one was worse
Final Destination vibes.
HAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHA<br><br>&quot;George are you alright?&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah...sure&quot; <br>Like dude? Is there something else you could ask George?! I CANT STOP LAUGHING
Bruh! That’s freaking insane!!! Holy shit!
Tornado.<br><br><br>People sits by GLASS windows.<br><br><br><br>Just wow.
jeez that looks like an earthquake in the beginning
STOP FILMING THIS AND RUN FOR YOUR LIVES WHAT HAS SOCIETY BECOME.
That&#39;s a thunder storm in South East Texas 😂😎
Lol. Woman near the window hears a rumble, and is like K BYEEE...
Obviously green screen and CGI.  Obvious fake video.
bItCh,rUn!
Holy cow!
Don&#39;t understand how the airport wasn&#39;t notified about this way ahead of time...they have one of the most direct connections to weather in the area..
what happened to the plane?
When I saw it ripped of the windows I shivered 😅
Alternative title: My Thumb (ft. Tornado sounds)
Airports should be built to withstand a category 5 hurricane. Plate glass windows are DANGEROUS. They should be bulletproof!
Were the flights delayed?
thumb
That’s scary
Plot twist: the tornado actually hits the airport, not the airplane
Just chilling
no way that tornado smashed that window inside job newtons law has been violated.
That big finger did all of that???
Damn they couldn&#39;t warn nobody??
Great camera work 😂 😂 😂
View of finger, useless.
So that&#39;s how the kids came up with the plastic bag over the head challenge. I always wondered about that.
You would think that if anywhere the airport would know if a tornado was approaching and warn the concourse......wth?
Strange no warning PA not working ????
I watched this again and noticed that you can hear the tornado coming even before the lightning strike.  Rumble, rumble.  I saw another video of this tornado, but the person wasn&#39;t in the same area of the airport as you.  All you could see was swirling rain and wind out of the window.  On this video you can hear the tornado&#39;s wind and fury.
Raw footage? You blocked out the whole thing.
Are you ok?
people are freaking out cuz his thumb is in the way... I dont think my first instinct would to get up out of my chair and stand by the windows during a tornado. Right?
George gives no fucks.
Hey, our flight is delayed.  How do you know, they didn&#39;t announce anything.  Well, that&#39;s our plane that just flipped over.  Oh.
a video of a fingerprint.
Well they did call for a chance of showers.
Goddamn!😨
Still trying to figure out what the guy at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=94">1:34</a> is wearing on his/her head.
The video is him sitting down for about a minute, then he covers the camera with his finger for the cool stuff. Brilliant
And that&#39;s why you don&#39;t use thin glass for windows.
Some people are unaware, some need more information before they react, some freak out and need guidance and others are the ones that live!
How come nobody told auntie Em
Dang it’s a bomb went off in the airport but it was a tornado that blew the plane rip
How is George on his phone during a tornado
If it sounds like a train get as far as u can
This aired on a TV show!<br>&quot;EyeWitness Weather Disasters&quot;
And PS the window just blew out I hope you&#39;re okay what are you do do not believe that fuel what the airplane has sprayed in the airport
You know the rules about tornadoes stay away from Windows and plus you&#39;re not supposed to be in front of a window watching it while it is lightning
near to end of the vid , it has a weird tune made by the wind, can anyone else hear it or is it just me
“George, you alright?”<br>“Yeah, Sure!!1”
Did George just sat there
Glad you made it through that one... I can&#39;t even watch them on video without me getting scared and tearing up lol  I have been through a few and to this day still scared shitless...  I&#39;m trying to get stronger by watching them but it&#39;s not helping  oh boy!
Is that guy throwing up?
It&#39;s been years since I first saw this and it&#39;s still one of my favorite videos... That nice shot of the lightning, the way the glass starts to warp, the speed at which everything happens... Hell, the fact that the camera is covered during most of the action might have made it even better - everything is fine and then by the time you lifted your phone seconds later everything was a wreck. And then, of course, George.
George was gonna finish that tweet. .....no matter what.
George is a real OG
How are you and Georgey boy still chillin in your seats in the middle of a sucking vortex of death. Meanwhile George is like &#39;hold up, lemme finish posting this on Insta&#39;
Lol no words just run
Lol george has made my day
It really took that long for people to move away from the windows?
Think for the poor guy outside - who&#39;s putting his heart and soul into trying to light his cigarette .
is it me or did the tronado rip off a window? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=107">1:47</a>
I farted during a tornado once
George is like, &quot;yeah sure.&quot;  lol
When you can see the reflection on the window start to physically expand, it’s time to leave.
You could of got sucked in or worse and it would of helped if we saw the tornado
George you alright? “Yea sure”
Tornado landing at St. Louis airport
Oh look, flying shards of glass. Let&#39;s stay here.  And where were the loud alarms and announcements that usually come over the airport p.a. system telling people to evacuate before things get that bad.  I have been through a tornado evacuation at the  Denver airport where the alert was so loud you couldn&#39;t possibly miss it.
That one Chinese guy didn’t give a fuck he’s like when are we boarding?
Im going to guess you got delayed.
Why was he just randomly filming
Everyone runs and hides under something but George doesn’t give a shit.
That one dude stays in his seat on his phone
imagine being on the plane as the clean up crew lol
About <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=72">1:12</a> and on kinda sounded like an epic death metal dubstep remix tbh
You would think that, being an international airport and all, that they might have some equipment that would let them know something about the weather. Why were these people kept upstairs until it was too late? Lambert St. Louis International Airport does have a downstairs, after all.
That was scary. I had this kind of experience at home. Suddenly our house started shaking violently. I thought it was a hurricane/typhoon <br>( so sudden?? It was a sunny day ). I looked out the window and saw a helicopter landed near my house. 😅😅😅
i love raw videos like this! i hate how the news take them and edits the living shit out of them.
Me: ZOOM ZOOM
Wait. . . I thought the footage was cooked!<br><br><br>My life has been a lie
George gave no f**ks that day.
One guy just sitting cracked me up
I remember this, so many of the windows were boarded up after
Well shit
Must&#39;ve suck being ATC or ground crew..
Who still watches this in 3/5/2018 :)
Look at what plane? I am getting sea sick watching this.
go in bathroom
Having grown up in Iowa, there isn&#39;t anything that doesn&#39;t &quot;faze me&quot; anymore, so my reaction would&#39;ve been literally the same as George&#39;s.  &quot;You alright?&quot;....&quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;
id be crying and george be like &quot;yeah im alright&quot;
Aww that guy was just sitting over there holding his son
I find it troubling that there were no announcements or anything.  Who is responsible for monitoring the weather at the airport?  That tornado was produced by the same cell that tore up Joplin I believe.  There had to have been some communication regarding the threat of tornadoes.  Ridiculous.  Luckily no one was killed.
All hail the mighty thumb! Thumb for President 2020! Thumbs up!
So, was there a delay?
For safety sheet glass should be handmade.  And.  Recycled glass not be made into a ingredient of habit.
George was too busy playing Tetris, to give a fuck about a tornado.
Pilot of the plane: &quot;Do we have a checklist for being moved by a tornado&quot;<br>Copilot: &quot;Nope&quot;
I&#39;m surprised that there is still power
How can they be so calm?? It’d been shitting it!!!
Summary of this entire video:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>G O O D   L O R D</b>
The power of mother nature. Don&#39;t abuse her anymore.
Severe Emergency Management Failure.
Him: lighting storrmmm<br>Tornado: <b>ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT</b>
Must’ve been scary as shit to be in that plane
I love my name
The guy sitting there texting ..did he even move during that !?
That dude next to the dude was just on his phone not caring that a plane almost killed him.
Was the guy throwing up at the end?
Hate to be cleaning shit out of plane when tornado hit. Talk about a shitty job!!
Fuckkk im dead here in my bed of fear
Why did the airport authority not sound the klaxon to call people to shelter ??
Good view of a finger anyway..
You better be glad you were waiting
😭😭❤️️❤️️that person held on to that child 👶
What plane, I could not see anything, you hid the view, F for failed camera operating.
heehe
My reaction looking at the people in the reflection of the right window :O
Surely the airport had weather radar and enough time to tell people to get to a secure place within the airport!!??
Oh what a tornado warning??? Let&#39;s chill by this huge ass windows facing it!
the asian man gave zero fucks bout the windows or the tornado!!
So stupid.
George, you are king😂
I live in part of tornado alley it can get interesting
Well. Nice raw footage of your thumb. I&#39;m amazed beyond belief.
&quot;Dude, I would probably get away from that plane if it&#39;s dispensing fuel.&quot;<br><b>Old guy keeps texting</b>
That old dude casually just sitting as the windows busted out and basically all Hell broke loose.  I want him on my team when shtf!
Wow. The worst sound, a tornado. I heard one before when I was a teenager back in the early 80&#39;s in Ga.  It went straight down our railroad tracks behind our house and into town uprooting trees and tearing up roof on the store. Crazy. Thank goodness it didn&#39;t touch me and my folks. No one was hurt by the way.💒
Lemmie just sit here while a tornado blows glass at me and could possibly suck me right out of my seat
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=105">1:45</a> that poor dad hugging his son awwwwww
Stay glassy.
Guy is vomiting cause of low pressure stresses on his lungs.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=60">1:00</a> And a one two three do the harlem shake.
Yeah, of course we won&#39;t get killed if we sit down 5 feet away from the tornado, right? 🌪😵
What happens with the plane i didn&#39;t see it
That tornado had been planning to attack that airport for weeks, but as soon it realized that George was there too it hightailed it!
I love my name
attention everyone this isn&#39;t funny this is real😠
George, you are my hero
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=68">1:08</a> she&#39;s like HAIL NO
did anyone notice that the windows were warping
Am I the only one that noticed the older guy sitting there through this thing and never moved? Still looking at his phone after the tornado had ripped through.
That just standing there like😳😳
Most raw footage of a thumb I ever saw.
If George&#39;s phone had died I bet he would have pitched a fit.
If that one girl didn&#39;t move as fast as she did the windows would have have out into her face 😖
yes PUT THE CAMERA DOWN RIGHT IN THE CLIMAX MOMMENT GOD FUCKING DAMMIT
Person yells out guys a tornado is coming while evryone sits calmly by the window while tornado hits
u must have premession to film
Asain guy just sat there the whole time
Aw dammit our flights are delayed
It&#39;s fascinating to look that the windows. They start rattling and contract-expand.
Amazing to see the windows bowing from the pressure changes.
did that guy just throw up?
LOL. The old man was like &quot;Meh&quot;.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=80">1:20</a> ear rape is born
wait why was that dude. Gagging?? just  choking?
I was laughing the whole time<br><br><br><br>I&#39;m going to hell aren&#39;t I
Raw Footage huh? still not cooked?
OMG I&#39;d be screaming
My mom lied to me, Tornadoes don&#39;t sound like trains
O-O
Omg lol
How did i get from life hacks to this?
I like George ,he&#39;s cool.
If someone asked me if I was alright in that position I would sa this<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m gonna die
You can for sure see the tornado when lightning strikes.
The man sitting their is he blind and dead or just stupid
George just gives zero fucks. <br><br>MY MAN GEORGE
remember this like it was yesterday, that was the scariest  moment of my life...
saddest part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=103">1:43</a> poor dad
He is calm af
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=116">1:56</a> jet fuel isn&#39;t explosive guy, it&#39;s flammable. Its fumes are explosive, but with all the wind and rain, there&#39;s no chance for an explosion.
That guy looked like nothing was happening
O M G
Security: everyone get back and stay calm. It&#39;s just heavy wind. <b>sees the plane moving</b> HOLY SHIT IT&#39;S A FUCKING TORNADO!! RUN!!
That old dude wearing navy near the end didn&#39;t give a fly fuck... He just sat there and was texting away on his phone, like he was still waiting for the plane
I hope that guy&#39;s finger was ok
wt* whats going on on this airport
and I dub thee click bait
&quot;&#39;George you alright?&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah yeah, sure&quot; <b>continues looking down at phone</b> <br>Meanwhile George is receiving nudes from his girl he doesn&#39;t have time to look up at some bitch ass tornado. George has his priorities straight.
George is like my mom. Dangerous situation; he just goes w/ the flow.
then the camera guy goes full commando thinking the plane&#39;s gonna explode lmao
These people are LUCKY,.
just about everyone disappeared but the man playing candy crush. omg. his phone was still in his hands.
I would be fucking gone.
&quot;george u alright&quot;<br>&quot;yeah sure lol&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m sorry I just had to put it like that
You piss your pants to late bro...
That old guy on his phone playing blackjack like nothing is happening. That&#39;s when you know your old and death doesn&#39;t matter to you.
Omg it time through the window || this is so cool .
i    feel   bad

But the airplane would be leaking poisonous gasses so I would recommend leaving that area
holy shit
For once no false flag event!
Poor planes
&quot;I would probably get away from that plane if it&#39;s venting fuel&quot; well aircrafts are allowed leak limits. So fuel leaks are not a problem it only means they would have to refuel
That old guy in the hat wasn&#39;t phased a bit! He just sat there the whole time texting away!!  😛
George: Lieutenant Dan and the Storm
your thumb covering the camera lens is RAW dude
the old fella still looking at his phone, swiping away on Tinder
What the fuck was he thinking
Tornado; F*** THE AIRPORT &gt;:C<br><br>Humans: TAKE SHELTER NOW! <br><br>Tornado: xDDDDDDDD<br><br>Humans: OH NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<br><br>Tornado: <b>Destroys The Airport</b><br><br>Humans: WE SURVIVED :D
That must&#39;ve been scary
what bad luck. It would have been great if somebody with a camera phone actually caught what happened when the tornado came through.
oh my fuck nickelback is playing in the background which makes everything even worse
George you all right!? Yeah sure!
Didn&#39;t concourse c get the most damage in this?
George are you alright?<br>George: yeah sure<br>what the fuck
That wasn&#39;t a tornado. Sorry guys; last time I eat Taco Bell.
Woooooowwwwwww that&#39;s intense bruh
so fucking nuts this video gets me every time. how the windows just start bending and then you duck down and when you come back up, theyre just fucking gone. its incredible. glad you made it out of this safely
noobs, GET AWAY FROM THE FUCKING WINDOWS
imagine all the kids, traumitized! why tf are all of you joking around about this terrifying moment for kids and adults! WTF
R.I.P window 19somethingsomething-2011
oh wow it does sound like a train
Thank gosh not many people were hurt.
Old guy just sitting on chair, on his phone like nothing happened. 😕
Only armchair critique I have is why would you sit next to a large window pane when a tornado strikes? :\
great job just keep siting there that will  cut it
-- <br>Fortunately the windows broke so I could see blurry images of what you were filming. <br>--
It&#39;s interesting to see the people reflected in the windows gradually realizing they&#39;re in danger, and starting to react; this is the last thing anyone would expect to suddenly occur without warning in someplace like an airport.
George is no punk! He wasn&#39;t even shook!
So nobody got on the fucking intercom and told everyone to get on The floor and cover your heads?!?!
Scary,horror Video.😨😨
666 comments... whoops
i see the woman in front of him do this -look at the window grabs stuff bai i am not dieing today people
Thanks for blocking the camera with your thumb lol
Run. You&#39;re not in Kansas anymore. Asian dude puking. This video has everything. George is old school G. Never mess with old school G.
George is my new hero.
they had no warning
lmao @ george he&#39;s absolutely fine
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=70">1:10</a> That Lady Knew What was going on
that old dude sat there like a boss playin on his phone lol
wow this tornado is terrible
so no one warns tje airport???
:D
Plot twist: the plane suddenly comes flying in the window
its not a tornado its vomiting
Fuck that I would run
thank god I am I the uk
You did the right thing.  Many people who hang around to video a tornado usually gets hurt.  I could hear it hit, however.
George&#39;s you alright? Yah sure. George is dead
that tornado when i was little it hit my hotel we all had to move to the basemnt the kids sat in the corner while the adults giv eus candy to keep us calm
It&#39;s just a prank
WOW! That old dude is still just  sitting calmly in his chair playing with his phone like it&#39;s nothing he doesn&#39;t even seem bothered.
George 😂😂
I feel bad for anyone who was in the airplanes
That george guy was a complete and total badass.
Did George even move? He was on his phone before it hit and he looked like he was still in the same spot doing the same thing after it hit? The man has no fear, or he just invented a new concentration drill for the Navy Seals!?
George is me in every situation. Fuckin tornado hits and he&#39;s just sitting there as if nothing happened.
Oh no from tornado new you again
Intercom: &quot;Everyone, please evacuate quickly, a very harmful tornado is heading our way.&quot;<br>people at the airport?: &quot;Eh, we&#39;ll be fine, those intercoms are always stupid.&quot;<br><b>Tornado tears through airport</b><br>people: &quot;Why the fuck did no one warn us???&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=66">1:06</a> that lucky girl got out just in time
People- <b>look out the Window</b><br>me- WTF YOU DOING PEOPLE ITS A FREAKING TORNADO GTFO<br>people- <b>get sucked out the window</b><br>me- haha fuckers that&#39;s what u get for not listening to me
wait a minute . with all the fuckin technology we have. you mean to tell me that everybody was just sitting there and then a tornado popped out of nowhere . wtf this is an airport with the latest in weather radar and shit.
<b>Tornado passes over head</b> continues to look at phone...
That honestly looks fun. I&#39;m a psychopath.
Awesome, I want to be in that
why was the asian guy gagging lol
Where is the logic in having an airport that is predominantly glass windows in a tornado zone!!!
Someone really dropped the bass
Living in Oklahoma I can tell you Tornadoes are no joke! Next time there&#39;s something like this don&#39;t wait for the Windows to bust or flex. Just get the hell out of there before anything happens. Lol
I was in that air portar the time it was ver y scary
Tornado warning? Better get a spot by the windows.
that man said oh wait whats happening whys everyone running
Wow, if that plane had people inside it imagine how many people pooped their pants, scary thing but also exiciting to have lived through it unharmed.
Bra once I seen that lady run I woulda been gone boy. 😂😂
Mother Nature never ceases to amaze me.  Ever..<br>I think that we as humans become jaded towards what mother nature really can do. <br>I always ache for the victims but my god, I stand in complete Awe of its natural powerful beauty.
Very brave - glad you rented a car!!
Nice finger on lens.
random people:so we are just mining our own bisness <br>worker:everyone get the fuck down<br>window breaks <br>everyone:runs
for all those who dont know what the c means it means cyclone 10

George is my new spirit animal.

Tornado hits, George is like &quot;Get this fucking plane in the air&quot;
😭😭😭😥
God is amazing! :) &lt;3!
nice thumbs...
nice pic of your finger tip lol
Damn I would have scammed on so many free Cinnabons.....
I&#39;m surprised the Control Tower wasn&#39;t able to see the Tornado approaching on Radar and warn everyone...
George seems like the kind of guy who tells a tornado to piss off...
R.I.P HEADPHONE USERS
George opened his hands... &quot;be free&quot; he said... and alas, his last single fuck, flew away into the sky with the tornado!
George you all right?!<br><br>Yeah, sure!
Poor plane :(
my weather at school is a tornado
not cool matt
that was crazy. what tornado type was it an F2 F3 ?
cool
how are you so calm? &quot;meh windows broke... hey look there&#39;s a tornado...&quot;
BANG CRASH BOOOOOOOOM SHATTER WIND RUSHING PAST US....<br><br>George u k?<br>Ya m8

Thank god that woman moved!
George you alright?<br>yeah, sure.<br><br>amazing 😂
No offence...but are you insane? Why would you risk your life to get a minute of video? I&#39;m assuming it all happened so fast you didn&#39;t have time to run...but as soon as I saw those windows wobble, I&#39;d have ran, after beating cancer twice, I value my life more then a stupid video...but that&#39;s just me, hope you guys were ok!
George u alright yeah sure so this is a everyday thung
Also at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=98">1:38</a> the high pitch of the engine sometimes means that the aircraft has minor damage during a storm and I did say &quot;sometimes&quot;
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=27">0:27</a> you can hear the Boeing B737 - 832ER Southwest aircraft
that wizzling sound was from the tornado or the jet engine? and what happened to the plane? can&#39;t really see if, but I did saw few lightning through your thumb when u were holding the chairman
Anyone else see that wall in the back move at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=70">1:10</a>?
Nickelback playing?, these people are awesome.
Oh my god
I like how he just still sits there like it no big deal but it is
George is my new hero. Zero shits were given about being in a tornado.
I love how that old guy is just sitting there texting on his phone as all of this is going on.
for
Why is it always the case that people that aren&#39;t able to handle a camera, or are equipped with low-quality cameras always are in the best position to get good footage? While those who have the equipment and skill, never are?
&quot;George, you alright?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, sure!&quot; I died
Wow the older man was still sitting in his chair on his phone seemingly unaffected by what just happened.
Shit&#39;s intense, yo.
OMG I saw a Dad With A Little Child Like a 2 year old
Yeah statues from Windows.... Was there no warning ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=56">0:56</a> pause it.<br>I paused at the best time to xD
Thanks for using your thumb to shield us from the worst of it.
1)<br>UP+SUB.
OMFG
That&#39;s the #1 dad at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=104">1:44</a>.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=107">1:47</a> GTFO!!!
where is airport personnel handling this!!! the Midwest airports have procedures in place for this exact kind of event. why was there no PA announcement advising passengers to move away from the windows and downstairs to the safer area of the building? this tornado did not form over the airport. it was on the ground and moved in... this was handled all wrong in every video I&#39;ve seen from this event.
How can you be so calm and collected? That is NUTS.
Ok, GAT TO GO 
 As Nickelback plays in background
Why can nobody ever hold the camera right?
The pressurization outside was less than inside, the windows were bowing OUTWARD not inward, therefore if they were to break, it would be sucked outward and into the tornado. FYI, that&#39;s commercial grade tempered glass, it won&#39;t break that easily in addition to it being coated in a thick laminate. That&#39;s why when you see shootings and robberies at gas stations, the glass is still intact even though it&#39;s shot full of holes.
Didn&#39;t they have warning? It&#39;s a freaking airport!<br>I can see why you decided to drive.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=67">1:07</a> look on the glass
That was light from the tunnel
That was not fire<br>
in 1963 a tornado actually hit and destroyed building in saint Louis I live near saint Louis I live about 30 miles away
I can see you videoing in the window
If we&#39;re all sharing favorite parts of the video, let&#39;s talk about the fact that Nickelback was playing in the background until the tornado hit. This is fucking incredible.
Can we back up just a damn minute here and discuss the first minute of this video? That was some serious creepin right there my man. &quot;Waiting, waiting.&quot; Wow.
I&#39;m surprised nobody came to evacuate them. On another video somewhere else in the airport people are getting evacuate early.
Damn, that was only just seconds to react..
What happened with the plane? I saw something that looked like fire in the distance. Was everyone alright?
Jesus... The noise that tornado made...
I love how that older guy is just sitting there like he&#39;s waiting for them to call his zone still even though the airport is destroyed and the plane is clearly not going anywhere.
That girl was smart to move when she did<br> If she stayed there, that could have killed her.
Damn this is like the polar opposite of the other airport tornado video. Everyone stayed calm and nobody started screaming like they were watching their family be tourtured in front of them!
i cant believe that the airport had no warning over the loud speaker, they had to know a storm cell capable of producing hail, winds and tornadoes might be in the area
&quot;George u alright?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah yeah sure c: &quot;<br><br>Murica
I would probably be laughing the entire time. I&#39;ve spent half my life in Texas and have been through countless tornados. I&#39;m not scared of them, I love them! They&#39;re really fun to watch. 
 Just<br>Freakin run idiot
The irony: EVERYone in the video is looking at a phone,  NOone is looking at a radar app. 
First I saw a lighting then I heard a little bit of noise then I heard a banging and I saw a some people and the young lady run and you started to duck on your phone is it true or not?
We missed all the chaos and action! You knew you were going to share this video so why didn&#39;t you film it better? Jeez, some people are so selfish...
wish we could have seen it actually hitting
So do the other people think the roaring is just a plane taking off?  They don&#39;t seem all that alarmed about it until debris begins hitting the concourse.
Ok, so - you were facing the window, filmed the lightning strike, and then when the windows started to shake, you and George turned your heads in case of debris? Did I follow that correctly?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=60">1:00</a> fine time for a terrorist to come out yelling bomb! bomb! bomb! I don&#39;t think anyone would have paid attention. 
why did it sound like he knew it was coming, just a q, ? .do they have different people go around the world wherever their going to create a storm of some kind and to film it 
That guy is so brave for taking the the video wail the tornado was going on
That was the most intense finger I&#39;ve ever seen
Please message me about using your video for a Weather Channel series. thanks!
That guy on his phone though; can we talk about that for a minute
Wait where there people on the plane
Wait a moment I go to lambert airport but I wasn&#39;t flying at that time
What was the scale ef4 
What happened to the plane? Didn&#39;t really see it.
Was that guy throwing up??
George doesn&#39;t give a shit :D
I feel sry for u 😕
Damn. I&#39;d make sure to put a bandana on so that dust won&#39;t go in my mouth or nose. W/ that window shaking, I would&#39;ve ran off somewhere away from any windows 
HOLY CRAP!! did you see that plane that was on its side. What category was that tornado.
I love how that one guy was causally on his phone and was like &quot; yeah sure&quot; when he was asked if he was okay. I hope ya guys were really okay or at least had an extra pair of underwear.
If you listen closely at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=30">0:30</a> you can hear a faint eerie rumble getting louder each second and you just know what&#39;s coming 0-0
Yes,  stewardess,  clean pair of underwear please.... 
um did it smell bad like fuel from the airplane or something
I would be like SEE YA when the window&#39;s started shaking. :P
Instances like this is why we need tornado researchers and chasers that are experienced out in the field.  This tornado spun up in short time, and by the time the warnings were issued, the airport had already been hit.
you missed the action in cam ugh
omg are you ok 
the girl at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=69">1:09</a> was like &quot;Lol bye&quot;
I&#39;m about 15 minutes away from that airport so glad I have a basement
&quot;George your alright?&quot; <br>George: &quot;yea sure&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>Said it Like nothing was happening.
This video sucks.
hey 4 I
STL is such a great place! Not only do we have East STL, South STL, North STL, but also tornadoes!
My favorite parts were when you were filming your hand and that bag, SICK!
was it very scary to be in that airport away from ur family?
Poor little kid
Oh wow, you were literally there! WOW!
whats the point in having a camera and keeping your finger over the lens for the best bit?????
on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=60">1:00</a> when you hear the first rumbling sound, that would&#39;ve been my cue.
It&#39;s okay, man, I&#39;m sure that at the moment you had bigger things on your mind than your future YouTube viewership.  :)
do i smell class lawsuit?..... those girls should have stayed in their seats.... the damage could have gotten them a payday..... but i guess they are alright... so yeah....
Makes me realize that everyone is free game when it comes to shooting videos in public.  No telling how many photos or videos there are out there that we don&#39;t know about.<br>  That woman didn&#39;t hesitate after hearing something hit the glass, booked it straight out of there.  Good thing too.
I was there with my mom, Dang, we never ran so fast! We got out of there when we heard the sirens, so We got out long before it hit, But we saw it hit the Airport Behind us. It was unbelivably scary! We were on Vacation, I guess it ended well 0.0
Tornado hits, windows explode, guy vomiting next to him, but the old man with the beard keeps on texting!  He&#39;s either a rock or an idiot.
Oh man I would be running for shelter!!
Despite all radio and T.V. programming stopped to follow the storm, tornado sirens sounding continuously and such the airport folks had no notice from their private weather service what was up.  So the tornado hit Lambert with no warning; it is a miracle no one died.  The personnel at Lambert responded admirably, getting people downstairs in an orderly manner and staying calm in the middle of chaos. I was at the airport three days later and was amazed to find it open and everything in place--what a comeback but, then, that&#39;s my hometown!  I was in the tornado of 1959 for which there was no warning and at the age of 18 was amazed how quickly rescue, cleanup and taking care of everyone proceeded.  St. Louis is good at this!
Would suck to be ground crew <br>
<b>covers camera</b>    &quot;OH WOW LOOK AT THAT PLANE&quot;
Wow
i would have move once i saw the windows moving
That old guy is still sitting on his phone like a champ
FACT;  There have been more tornado fatalities in St.Louis than any other U.S city.
<b>window shakes</b> Welp, time to GTFO
If I saw the glass shake i fucking run so fast
Oh dang
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=98">1:38</a>...is that fire ???
missed all the good footage eh?
Was that one guy vomiting?
good thing that girl in front of the window hauled ass!
Aww! That man was protecting his son! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ovTo30_myI&amp;t=105">1:45</a><br>How sweet! Poor baby!
That happend to me and my friend broke his leg and my brother died so did my grandma
One day I saw this video on the news, they said that was crazy! xD
Zero fucks are given on George&#39;s end. lol
It is funny how hero by nickelback is playing lol..you all needed a hero there
You put the camera down??? WTF

I think they need to rename safety glass
hey look a tornado.WTF!!!!!!!!
George is just texting away
1:46 Kudos to that determined father o.O I love how it starts, &quot;Yep, just waiting&quot;.
I wonder what George would be like in a horror movie...Hey George we should run from the serial killer...George:...Yea ok if you say so
if you&#39;d read the description you&#39;d know why we saw his thumb for those few seconds
There was never any danger of glass.  You can clearly see the windo was being sucked OUTSIDE.  If it shattered, it would have fallen outside, and been sucked into the wind.  You&#39;re just a coward. 
George gave NO fucks !
Yeah, i see the terminal filled with tornado debris and the airplane pushed sideways. Now tell me again why my flight to DFW is delayed?

Nice thumb view. We got to see your skin ridges instead of the real action. Cloverfield all over again. You get two thumbs up for ruining the video.
she could see it out the window that she was looking at.
They look like mirrors because it&#39;s too dark outside to see.
 must be a fun ride ;) 
that old man must not give a crap about his life
Pshh, pussy tornado.  I get better wind from my farts.  Hope noone was injured though
I had sex in a plane during a tornado. YOLO. 
Asians be like &quot;Hory sheet!&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m 95 years old, what the hell do I care&quot; - Pop (Grumpier Old Men)
The Indian dude across from you getting up right before the windows blew in...guess he knew something was up.
Wow
it happened again
Nice and calm.
&quot;Hey George you alright?&quot; &quot;Yeah sure&quot; calm as ever.
That is a scary sound, dang.

that old dude gave absolutly zero fuck
Is the airport a safe place to be o_o
I remember when I lived in Orlando when I was younger, we had SOO many Tornado Warnings, me and my parents eventually ignored...not ignored, but payed significantly less attention to them, cause they occurred EVERY fucking day. The advent of Tornado Emergency is a good idea. Tornado Warnings can mean a doppler indicated, or a storm capable of producing a Tornado. If you hear Tornado Emergency...that means get your ass to a shelter, cause there is a BIG tornado, tearing things up.
There is no concourse C10. There is a gate C10 and a concourse C.
Welcome to America
Are you lying, or you can&#39;t tell any asians apart?
Yea, sure
George you alright?
People are complaining about you not filming the &quot;good stuff&quot; they obviously could care less if you were okay. Talk about scary, what about the people on the planes or who work runway? Yikes!
Hey I&#39;m sorry that you guys lost your house!! I really am. Trust me, I&#39;m more scared than you are!! I live in a suburb of Chicago. We&#39;ve had an E-F1 tornado about 3 miles from my house, thank God! I have the biggest fear. When there&#39;s a severe thunderstorm warning, I&#39;m nervous as hell! We&#39;ve had tornado warnings for our county and I&#39;ve even heard the siren go off. You should see me then. If you see my face at that moment, you KNOW how scared I am. I look like the world is ending. :(
hey baby, you single?
Omg there&#39;s someone cuddling a child after bless them.these things are so destructive our country comes to a stand still with abit of snow ffs.amazing video.
Damm you didnt record the best part why ?
Raw footage of a thumb blocking anything interesting going on. 
My guess is it has to do with Lambert Airport being &quot;tornado proof&quot;. When it was built it was engineered to take Missouri mega-storms. As we know nothing is tornado proof 100%. But I agree people should have been evacuated to the lower concourse.
Its like something out of the fucking movie Twister, One second its all fine, Next destruction 
that lady next the window was out!
ya but their most common in america
Thats very true, they just come very rarely. I live in a city called bremen in northern germany and we had some formations of tornados here.
lol that asian dude was like hey where everyone going
Damn if i was there i would of just sat there like  &quot;i dont give a fuck lol&quot;
