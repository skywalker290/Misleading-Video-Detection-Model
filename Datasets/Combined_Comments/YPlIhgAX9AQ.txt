@ShristiVarshney if you see this I had a really huge crush on you!!! So much so that I used to visualise this story with you.<br><br>But I guess time passes, you used to feel nothing at that time, and now, I feel nothing for you.<br><br>I hope your husband finds this while listening to this song😂<br><br>Edit: please make this viral so that it reaches to you know who!💀

With my brother in one side and my bf on the other side🤣 and the best part is my brother didn&#39;t know that my bf was sitting beside me..

And we watched it together &amp; fooled my brother 😛 sorry bhaia. <br>But sadly he is not my bf anymore!

Sorry, reminds me of a beautiful girl in my university,  IGNOU.
Alia Bhatt reminds me if a beautiful girl in IGNOU.
IIM Ahmedabad in Delhi<br>bravo!
Arjun Kapoor is so handsome.
😊😊😊✌✌
Nice song. 😌
♥️
❤️
❤️❤️really happy ❤️listen this song 🎶
The fun fact is that ALIA got an admisson in IIM in this film!!!
Why is Yuri Bezmenov watching this video? :/
I searched this song watched it again since I had only watched this song on tv during my school days!<br>This song actually portraits my relationship! Arjun wears the same kind of spects just like my boyfriend!  And I am short he is just like Alia and Arjun! Also this is how everything went during our BHU days though he was my senior! Today I met him and post the meeting I just came here to watch this song only to cherish memories of those college days ❤️
Forget about this my college life went protesting against college administration and stopping opposition from filing nomination.<br><br>My best friends and my GF are still from from my school. Anyone reading this if you are reading in school enjoy it.
Best song.
I watched 2 states with my mom and lol this song was extremely awkward to get through with her next to me :/
My hostel lyf story
Five points someone  ..love story of iit<br>2 state .. lovestory of iim<br>Writer :Chetan Bhagat (life story )

Trust me , my favourite song right
Such a life depends on the kind of college fees u give 😂 . 20 lakhs plus per year can get you this but not 50k per year
Aditi!..🤗❤️
Why is everyone talking just bout the college life...The song is soooooo goood.... Bollywood was so good before wid good songs

This version of song hits so different than the ones on spotify
Wonder full song 😍😍
gajab😁👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Oh Girls ...... Maturity is when you get to know you don&#39;t have entry in boys hostel like this 🤣😆
This movie is not masterpiece, but it&#39;s still so good to watch it.
Many people are criticizing this song for not being realistic as  college life, but still came here to listen it
Let&#39;s be honest this is the best film of Arjun Kapoor
Alia is so gorgeous i m big fan of her
In Movie, They both are IIM-A Student but in real they did not even cleared their 12th standards
0⁰0⁰0p00p000
Tapatap
I love the 2nd antara of this song only
Nobody gets so physical in college life
I m not a fan of Alia but in 2 states she is looking very pretty 💛💛💛💛😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Best part this song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=124">2:04</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=150">2:30</a> ❤️

The best part of this song is Theline&quot; Hairat ko bhi hairaniyan hone lagi, ab hosh main naadaniyan hone lagi, baithe hain dil is dillagi se haar ke mehngi badi mannmaniyan hone lagi &quot;
College ki yaad a gayi ye song sunke
I want to see the reaction of IIM A people after watching this song.
Did chetan bhagat really do this  😮
Cool song and cool collage .nice combination
Come on alia

1998: Qayamat se qayamat tak..🔥<br>2014: 2 states..🔥
I remember 7 years back when this song came out i was air conditioner
Can&#39;t believe Chetan Bhagat did this in his college days.
Do same things happen inside IIMs portrait in the video
Movies?
The bridge is the most beautiful part of this song❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=124">2:04</a>

It&#39;s a great luck to study in a college like this
Where could I get this college!
Nice song
Alia are very crazy
One of Best Romantic Song&#39;s💓💕
mujhe bhi karna hai ye wala mba..............
Back bancher do everything in college leaving studies
Comment section is a whole mode. It&#39;s like people are coming with facts instead of fictions.
Oofo song op 👍🏻👍🏻
I hope I get this life while doing my MBA 😉😉😁😁
Wish Bollywood knew that we live IRL!🙂
Superrrb Awesome Fantastic song
While reading the book, i was very surprised by the idea of them sneaking into eachother&#39;s hostel rooms. While watching the movie, not much ✌️😁
I liked alia better back then
Same room same hostel ..yeah okay
Enim green
the tempo is too fast
I honestly sick and tired of these comments. When ever there is kiss scene then everyone comments about their real life partners. Dude they are actors. It’s ACTING. It really isn’t funny anymore.
Lalalala
Trust me aisa sirf unhi colleges mei hota hai jo hamari aukaat se bhar ke hote 🤣🤣🤣
Mast MBA ho gaya dono ka!
Girls ko aise boys hostel me kaha ghusne dete hai?
All time fav movie

Harvard ke hostel bhi iss tarah Christmas ko decorate nahi karte honge.
Nice video 💞💞
Kitna maja ata haiiin yaa sab seen kar naa main🤤🤤
Offo! Mujhe bhi isi university mei jana hai
हैरत को भी हैरानियाँ होने लगी...<br>अब होश में नादानियाँ होने लगी...<br>बैठे है दिल एक दिल्लगी में हार के...<br>महँगी बड़ी मनमानियाँ होने लगी...❤️
And what kind of influence are they trying to put on the youth ? now all the youngsters got to be thinking &quot;so I gotta get laid during my college experience&quot;. Study first, make your parents proud. That&#39;s more important than thinking about if fwb or sidechick is better.
And the line is mehngi badi manmaniyan hone lgi ❤️❣️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=110">1:50</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=151">2:31</a> feels like heaven 💙💙💙
Kamina is not a gali it&#39;s a caste nd the use of these sensitive terms otherwise ozzes casteism......we need to get our facts right bef we state or speak anything...only then we&#39;ll be able to eliminate these stereotypes based on caste,race religion etc......
Nai toh rk engaged gal se shaadi karegha
That guy 😂😂😂❤️❤️ from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=4">0:04</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=11">0:11</a>
Perhaps, the only film where Alia acted so naturally
ഇവിടെ മലയാളീസ് കുറവാണല്ലോ....😝ഉണരൂ പ്രേക്ഷകരെ....😂
Well I thought this would be my college life but after reading comments I realised.
I like this song 😍 so much thank you...... 💖💖 making this song
IIM mein aisa hota hain kya !?!?!
Everyone is saying you dont have a college life like this....was I the only one who had relates to this...cause I had a college life jus like this
Aur hamare clg mei ladke-ladkiye bolte bhi nahi hai 😐
The fact is I know you will not believe but I had a kind of same college experience..
I wanna kiss aliaaaa
No IIM Is not like this. You can&#39;t make out with girls in boys dorm. Also they don&#39;t have soo many extracurricular dance or celebrations. They study most of the times.
I guess chetan bhagat writes novel coz he did this in IIM..😀
Very realistic song...90 percent people can relate  at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=3">0:03</a>....Me the red shirt guy..😀
RIP.... if you think that you will have this type of college life even after taking engineering.....
I miss a girl friend like alia
Ye sab to baadme kar lenge phle CAT to nikle
currently my order of precedence is 2 rajput girl and then only yadavni
Aise kon nahata hai bhai hostel mein. Only in Alia bhatt movies. first student of the year now this.
Now decide whether u want alia Or that barking kangana
Alia fogure was most apt this time ab pencil lgti h

Just dropped by and am tired of  liking all the comments 😂
Everyone blame Arjun kapoor for his poor acting skills but honestly, I adore this movie so much. 💙
Offo mar ke bagao corona ko
campus do exist like this but life will never be like this in collage
IIM A is an osm college yaar
Iss ghatna m dikhae sb chize kalpanik hai...kisi bhi jeevit  ya mrit vyakti k jeevan se iska kuch lena dena nhi hai😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
I am young
How to buy college degree illegally?
The music and lyrics and people are good
no 1 talking about soul of the song ....singer <br>just feel her voice offfoooooooooooo
This type of college is LPU..only if you have the money to afford it🤣

Back when Alia was chubby and Arjun was slim  ,it’s the exact opposite now
Director k ghar paida hone me hi faayda h.. Easily films milti hain, million me followers milte hain kuch fans to jaan dene k liye bhi paagal ho jate hain... Movie me kissing, bed scenes sab Common ho jata h.
Time really flies... 6 years passed
This is the best movie of Arjun Kapoor till date bcz he has really a great chemistry with Alia in this.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍 Krish and Ananya Woww 😍
Hume ese pg nhi milte inko hostel mil jate h🙄😂😂
I love you
You&#39;re  so handsome
Any one after 2020!!
Offo alia love yoy💙💙💙
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=102">1:42</a> it was the boys turn to sing &quot; sir pe bithau ya thappar lagaau&quot; but instead the girl sings this part. In our society if girl slaps guy, it is cute. But if the guys slaps girl (even playfully)....u know the rest
She looks like eager to have... If I would be there, I could never make her sleep fir 2 days 😘😘
Arjun looks like Khamba in this film..
..
I would dedicate this beautiful song to my Bestie coz use daat ke bhagau ya seene se lagau smajh nahi ata 😂❤
Alia Bhatt playing the role of an IIM student , we better ask her the full form .
Well,who the hell knew that arjun kapoor had a sharp jawline tho!!😅

Mohit, ye video tumpe bani hai !
Such patched up life can&#39;t be possible in a college life if that is not some live-in life or something more.
who have seen the song first  you would have watched the movie for sure if yes then like
This is the only film where I liked Arjun Kapoor
kya hot kess hai
my college life was dark souls and depression
Bhai aisa collage hota kahan hai😂😂
One moment of silence for people who think this is fake. Get an MBA degree (from top tier colleges). The college is exactly the same 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=124">2:04</a> fav line....and....best part of the song♥️

⭐⭐⭐👏👍💞💙
Best movie
my brother makes me put this in the tv forever
Nice
In 2 states - Arjun  - on diet , Alia - no diet<br>Now- Alia - on diet , Arjun - no diet
Thee druggies
Arjun and aliya  very perfect and good acting in this movie
Trust me, you have more chances of discovering a Pink Unicorn than having a college experience like this.
Alia the best
💘💘💘💘💘💘
Dedicated to someone special. ..
Alia&#39;s chubby cheeks
IIMA Students who just Completed their Mba <br>Aisa b hota tha apni college mai😂😂
Who&#39;s here in 2020??😇
Oooo
Last me dono ka placement ho jata to accha rehta😂😂😂
Offo when alia get know that arjun has tasted positive for corona and she will OK I will talk after lecture
Whoever will watch this   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b73BI9eUkjM">https://youtu.be/b73BI9eUkjM</a>                 God will give their MOM A LONG LIFE
alia was so beautiful...but after she became more thin her beauty is gone ..and im noticing that after humpty sharma ki dulhania ..after that all the movie she did she doesnt look that beautiful like before but her acting is awsome as always 😊
Galatbith ganda gathi ho
her skirts are too good
This is basically friends with benefits Hindi version 🤷😂
Who else everyone has it&#39;s own time or era....After that He is fizool
time when when arjun knew ho to act..
Damn alia and Arjun nailed their roles in this one. Direction was top notch. And the cast too.❤️ Probably the only movie of Arjun I&#39;ve watched but I feel he was the best fit for this.

My college life ♥️ in this song♥️
They&#39;re so ugly
pwnbiwbiwbjiwbiw
Middle finger to alia bhatt. The most arrogant actress
Pls unfollow alia bhatt fake lady<br>Boycott star kids🙏🙏🙏🙏
Exactly once upon a tym arjun was charming
Any one in lockdown plz like here
Nostalgia.
Arjun Kapoor is my favourite hero he is very handsome 🤗
I don&#39;t like this
Apna dam par hara ho kar dekho
Kutti aliya bhatt bap ka dam par hada hota ha sala
products of nepotisim
Koun hai yeh pagal ladki?? acting ki A bhi nehi aati...isska naam kya hai??ha yaad aaya ajj kal bade charche mein hai ye...iska fan following jo kam ho raha hai...aur advance RIP 🙏... Ranveer kapoor jo isko chhodne wale hai.. shame on you...
Uff chicken is what i got..
Nepokids
Nepotism nepotism nepotism... Loser Alia and Arjun... Responsible for SSR death
The only movie where Arjun actually looked cute !! <br><br>Edit: Ya ok Ishaqzaade as well !! 😒👍
Am i the only one who thinks the &quot;dirty&quot; scenes are actually cute cuz the couple are only showing their love for each other in a heated way lol<br>(I dont mean to offend someone)
This type of cool College life only in this types of Movies... Not  in real life .. Just think  it&#39;s actually happen!!
Pocket mey sharatey nhi condom hoti hai sorry pls dont offende from my comment l dont mean to hirt anyone just for fun.
Pagal
Stupid alia and arjun
Stupid girl
Stupid alia
Alia Bhatt is talented and versatile and has potential to be the next female superstar of Bollywood. Love her.😍😍😍
💗Alia Bhatt &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;any other actress
2 min of silence for those who think their college life would be like this

The Protagonists R Never Shown Studying Seriously,&amp; R Always Shown To B Enjoying Their Lives Without Any Worries,Jst Lyk Some Other Karan Johar <a href="http://movie.it/">Movie.It</a> Doesn&#39;t Work Lyk That In Top Institutions Where Studies Must B Ur Top Priority So As To Surpass The Cut-Throat Competition.<br>Also,I Found The Girl A Wannabe &amp; The Leads Desperate To B In A Relationship.Movies Lyk Dis R Highly Misleading!!
2020 anyone
Male singer a66ai aavaz hai uski
Alia is the best
Arjun tune kya kha liya hai.. Jo nikal raha hai pichle 3 saal se.. U look really good in this movie.
@ good song
Aditi mam voice awesome
Arjun is so underrated
2 states is a great movie
Im from philippines but i more like Bollywood songs than songs here in my country. And my idol is aliabhatt ❤️😍
Movie name kya he
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=120">2:00</a> is the only true part of a collage life in this whole video
Surprisingly this movie showed a lot of heart
This song is copied from Jay Chou&#39;s Sports Car Model..very disappointed with SEL..i thought at least they are original..
waah kya hostel hain girls kabhi bhi kisi ke room mein jaa sakti hain.
One of the motivation to get in to iim, now in one of the old iim, but can&#39;t find this things in Institute 😄
Arjur tab ladki pathiya tha abb anty pathaya 😂
Just remembering my college days those were ossum days 💓💓💓
2 mins of silence if u think u will get a love story like this
Hiiiiii
Please don&#39;t believe this kind of things. It&#39;s nothing but bullshit
Super❤
Anyone in 2020
Nice song
This type of hostels exist only in movies
Arjun Kapoor only got the movie by being a chapsu. His acting was so irritating. Zero talent

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=124">2:04</a> 💚<br>Hairat ko bhi hairaniyaan hone lagi,<br>ab hosh me nadaniyan hone lagi,<br>baithe hai dil ek dillagi pe har ke,<br>mehngi badi manmaniyan hone lagi

How many of u preparing CAT exam to join IIM 🤣🤣🤣
In both the Indian novel movies of Chetan bhagath : 2 states and Half girlfriend , Arjun kapoor is the actor...and he really suits that position ...and now I can&#39;t imagine a face other than Arjun  while reading chetan&#39;s remaining books!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=124">2:04</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlIhgAX9AQ&amp;t=151">2:31</a> my heart just melts.. amazing beat... &lt;3

March 2019 I am still here💟❤
Арджун Капур нравиться но в паре с Алией нет. Вообще между ними химии нет. Вот с Паринити Чопра хорошо смотрится Арджун. Алия и сама по себе мне не нравится не приятная девушка. На внешность не очень не в обиду фанатам Алии Бхат.
This movie reminds me one of   imp memory of my life....
Music by Shankar ehsaan loy lyricist Amitabh bhattacharya da.
Still my fav
Bold title updated in YouTube not good looking!
