Outstanding Background score
Every frame is like Painting 🎨🖌️❤
One of the Best trailers in World Class Cinema of all time ever!!!
NOW AL STYLE AGAIN AFTER AGAIN AFTER AGAIN TILL END IN INDIA AND BRITISH-USA.FORGET FUSSIA.
This is Indian version of Masada battle!
NO UNCLE QUESTION,ONLY SOME WORSE.
JI UNCLE,HAI UNTIES.
The background music is the best only ahead of Meghna&#39;s entry theme in Jaane tu ya jaane na 🤍
Jo Mughalo ki gaan chata woh jhatput😂
History was different from this movie. Alauddin khilji never met with Ratan singh. Some other king fought with ratan singh and both died. While khilji was on the way to see Padmavati but Padmavati and other womens were already sati.
is this the fight between the muslims and hindus?
BGM 👌🔥❤️
It&#39;s been 6 years ... still one of the best trailer cut off entire cinema ✌️
They used HALO game theme music in background. 😅
JAGN KA EK HI USUL HOTA HAI JIT OR NAM.
Val lagche vai,last er part ta.specially.
THERE WAS NEVER MEANT A BANGLADESH,IF NOT THIS MOVIE TO US.
Sanjay Leela Bhansali is Better than SS Rajamouli Yakkeen Karoo❤
Deepika tu mamuli hai
Ranveer performance 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The best historical movie ever made by Indian cinema
Maa ki lun dey di thi rajputo ki
Alauddin khiljii🔥🔥
Just finished it. Wow, what a blast!
The trailer, the movie is a whole vibe<br>No one can create historic dramas like SLB.<br>He he makes a comeback soon
The mughtiness and stremgth of India before the english came and messed it up.  The english were the savages and the barbarians not the indians.
Happy Birthday Deepika
Last dialogue sabse ghatiya
Fighter official trailer fast plz
the music is amazing
Ranveer singh bestest of bestest acting in any role ❤❤❤
The trailer itself gives goosebumps without any dialogues
How many are still obsessed with Rani Sa BGM and movie padmavat climax 🔥
Can&#39;t believe that India still has such stupids and brainless people who opposed this movie&#39;s release !!!!!
Jai bhawani jai rajputana
The background music is just amazing, mind-blowing, and goosebumps giving music😮😮
Masterpiece movie in the history of Indian cinema
Who is came here to watch this trailer again in dec 2023
I always tell people. If you need to watch only ONE Bollywood movie - it&#39;s Padmavaat. I&#39;ve watched probably 10 times by now but I cry every time.
This is a super movie i wached in cinemas can you please upload padmaavati movie again in cinemas in south africa Johannesburg in monte casino to watch that movie again please
This is called  TRAILER OF THE CENTURY !
In history &#39; the sultan of Delhi alauddin khilji &#39; came to conquer chittor and to marriage with &#39; rani           padmaavati &#39; but she is already a wife of the great &#39; rana rawal ratan singh &#39;  but in ad 1303 &#39; alauddin khilji &#39; seized  chittor but the great &#39; rana rawal ratan singh &#39; fight heroically with &#39; alauddin khilji &#39; but he was deafeated and killed in the war. 😢😭
Not yet😊
Padmaavat is best periodic movie ever made in india.
I&#39;m still watching many time😂
I am ksahtriya. This song gives goosebump.
It&#39;s been 6 years .. I remember watching it in 3D for the first time and got mesmerized by the flim. The BGM still lives rent free in my head !

Ranveer&#39;s role is unbeatable

Imagine Shahid role SSR ko milta
Even after 5 years this teaser gives me goosebumps, one of the best teaser ever created by the master storyteller SLB
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=72">1:12</a>
Still giving goosebumps in 2023😮
Someone send me a link pls I want to watch
I remember the scandals surrounding this movie. From &quot;historical accuracies&quot; to the plot, to the violence incitement towards SLB and Deepika P... my goodness. I&#39;d be so sad if this movie wasn&#39;t released. It has its flaws but it is magnificent and powerful in messaging. It was such an experience in the theaters.
I have realised that I’ve never watched a trailer of any movie until 2019 and I am 20 years old 😂 i used to just go and watch the movie directly in the theatre. I love this movie and after watching it for 4-5 times, i have now come to watch the trailer.
Who came watch the trailer after so many years
👌👌
One of the best trailers cut 🙌🏻
Es movie ka trailer Aaj bhi dekh ker goosebumps feel hote hai, this was the real creation..
Shahid sir amazing Role Raja Ratan

Padmavat and bajirao mastani two one of best movie of our time
Begitu hebat nya suci nya menjaga kesucian untuk suami😮😫
Full of blunders  and fake as expected . Bollywood 😂😂😂
Ranveer Singh deserved a national award for this movie
சிறந்த படம் பாராட்டுக்கள் ❤❤❤❤
A maniac cannot have such huge achievements . A great military general before he became the king . Shame on Bollywood for portraying allauddin like this .
What a perfect trailer...visuals music ..spot on..flawless.
After adipurush movie watching my respect increase patmavati movie😅
Rajput🫀❤️
Mughlo ko desh mai laye woh,<br>Beti ka pichwada mughlo se pitwaye woh,<br>Bechari ke pichwade ko mughlo ke talwar par rakhe woh,<br>Bechari ka Pichwada fat jaye fir bhi dhan kamakar de woh. Yahi itihas hai deshbhakti aur zuti shan na dikhaye bolta hai india.
This movie trailer is better than whole Adipurush movie ..
Here after Aadipursh. Just imagine if instead of Om Raut, Sanjay Leela Bhansali created Ramayan. How phenomenal it would be.
Any random shot of this movie is far better than entire Adipurush movie.
Rocky aur rani kii prem kahani official trailer fast plz
Who is here only for background music
Who came here after Adipurush
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=113">1:53</a> goosebumps
That&#39;s how you make a periodic films.... the characters should justify the the need of the story....
sub español?
Allaudin should&#39;ve just watched the Padmaavat movie <br>We got to see the Rani 😂
Movies can&#39;t alter History...
Ranbir Singh best acting Khilji
Ohh!Pure Sanjay Leela Bhansali film🔥🔥❤️, only problem was chosing Shahid for doing the character of Rajput king,miscast
Can&#39;t explain, how perfect this trailer is !❤❤
Alauddin Khilji the great D mangon ke chhakke chhudaane wale Alauddin Khilji
this what i called a &quot;EPIC&quot;
I am back only for bgm... Wow
Duniya me agar koi mard huaa hai shtry Dharm ke log hi hai jinme rajput or Sikh hai
The entry of Sultan Alauddin is out of the world. Just Deadly and Killer!!!! That is how a warrior King should look. Ferocious in battlefield. Ranveer  and the makeup artist have just nailed it. Amazing background score. great Trailer but average movie.
Show me a better trailer than this i will wait<br>SLB the magician❤
Khil Mere Low me 😎
Ranveer singh ne next level acting ki h &quot;padmaavat &#39;&quot;movie me no one can beat him in this role extremely blockbuster ❤❤❤💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥😘😘😘
Every scene of this movie was epic❤❤ and also there were a lot of twists in the story...just loved the movie alot❤❤

ISLAM a curse to humanity.!!
This was released on my 14th birthday and almost 5 and half years i am still in love with this trailer
I didn&#39;t watch this movie yet. But I know the story. This Khilji bilji was nothing infront of King Prithu of Assam. Came with 10,000 soldiers and escaped only by himself. Tatti nikal gayi saley ki😅😅
Sanjay leela  bhansali destroyed the history  Aluddin killejeee was an amazing  administrator and in this movie  ohhh dear  totally bloody disaster he truly don&#39;t know how to make historical movie&#39;s 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Can someone suggest some movies related to &quot;Padmavat&quot;❤
Certainly the best trailer ever made in Bollywood
a trailer more than 3 minutes with only 2 dialouges with and extremely mesmeriging bgm<br>only with scenes and still goosebumps<br><br>that&#39;s the power of sanjay leela bhanshali
0$*-1₹=?1$,£*%€^[.]
What a caste discrimination in this movie.   Rajput is also hindu.Then  Say hindu not rajput.
The best work of Ranveer Singh till date.
Goosebumps ❤
Insane❤❤❤❤❤.....no words to express the feelings<br>And the best background sound❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Background music is very super
Oh my godddd it raise my temperature to peaks🤯🤯🤯💥💥💥 goosebumps all over trailer
I wish they make a certain film which shows the pain more .
It also deserves recognition sameas RRR❤️🔥🔥
I feel glad m the part of the land of mewar rajasthan
this movie deserved similar amount of recognition as RRR did<br>such a strong movie in tecnical side too the cinematography, score, songs, acting, editing everything Sanjay leela Bhansali nailed it
Starting bg music is superb
Lakin at the last ranveer ne deepika sa hi shadi kari na 😂😂😂😮
This was bollywood at it&#39;s peak.

Rajasthan ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌈🇮🇳🙏💯
Only Sanjay Leela Bhansali sir can direct such historical films properly in india ♥
Jai ho Maa padmavati🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
خرافات الهنود الذي لايصدقها أحد
Fake story , big lie, the producer made the story from his dreams
Kya hum haar gye --nhi <br><b>To fir aap yaha kya kar rhi hai</b> <br>That particular scene and shahid&#39;s acting was commendable ✨

Most watched trailer in my life ....may be more than a thousand times...
Released during my college first year ....but after five years...still this trailer gives me goosebumps..!!
10 6?
This movie is a feast for the soul. So visually captivating and hauntingly beautiful! I loved it. :)
After watching so much Hollywood garbage I needed a bath for my brain. Glad I chose this masterpiece of a movie. I was completely transfixed from start to finish. Like watching art and poetry at the same time. So beautiful. The scenery and the people, were all mesmerizing.
Bache khilji ko dekh k dre ge ..<br>no dialogue but goosebumps 🔥Ranveer n aag lga di❤️❤️
One of the classics of Sanjay leela bhansali
Jai maa Padmini 🙏⛳
Only one dialogue in whole trailer. And then a bgm came and it gave us goosbumbs🥰😍
Legends watching in 2023💥❤️
Shahid kapoor ka suit jyada bhari tha character se puri film me aisa lag raha tha ki bus jabardasti dialogue bol rahe hai<br>Unse better acting to gora aur badal ki hal
Jai Bhavani , Jai Rajputana 🥰🥰
Sanjay Leela Bhansali is an iconic director.This film is a master piece.
Indians have lots of historical monuments they can make one ATBB every year but they will not because of their politics and intolerance
Why this kind of genre movies are banned in india<br>Indians really need to make historical big set movies again not like prithviraj
When eyes speaks louder than words
Jai bhawani goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Pathaan ki controversy dekh kr padmavat ki yaad aa gyi<br>I hope ki padmavat ke time me logo ne jis trha milkr is film ko hit krwa kr nafrati chintu ko muh me jute mare the usi trha se pathaan ko v log hit krwa kr nafrati chintu ke muh me dobara jute padwayenge
Extra ordinary music by Sanjay Leela Bhansali
Take a bow Sanjay Leela Bhansali   the finest at the art of direction <br>Dude, this movie is art. The way he directed some shorts literally showed the epicness of Rajput&#39;s <br><br>Today, I saw this movie for the first time. I know I am late, but u know it&#39;s never too late❤️<br>Now i can clearly say,<br>No one can make such epic periodic dramas other than the great Sanjay Leela Bhansali<br>Agree or die
Puri movie ma shahid Kapoor ka atna seens nhi Hein jitna is trailer ma Hein🤣

Alauddin Khilji Gandu
Masterpiece
The soundtrack 😍😍
Iski to Nahin ho raha hai
Jama nhi shakti
Indian cinema at its best again before they called themselves Bollywood and made disgusting/ridiculous films. They don&#39;t need to copy anybody. They are superb by themselves.
मैं जब-जब इस मूवी का ट्रेलर देखता हूँ…<br>इतिहास मेरे सामने आ जाता है…<br>और BGM सुनकर खून खौलता है…<br><br>सच में भारत का इतिहास… और मुग़लों का अन्याय…<br>सहने योग्य नहीं…<br>एक क्षत्रिय होने के नाते ये मेरे लिए फ़िल्म नहीं…<br>इतिहास है… <br>वास्तविकता जिसे लोग केवल मनोरंजन के दृष्टिकोण से देखते हैं…🙏<br><br>हर हर महादेव<br>जय जय राजस्थान <br>जय मातृभूमि जय भारत 🇮🇳
Alauddin khilji 🔥✌️
SANJAY LEELA BHANSALI JAISA KOI NAHI  SANJAY SIR IS A LEGENDRY DIRECTOR👌👌👌👌👌👌👌💜💜💜💜💜💜💜❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

The best movie ever ♥️♥️
I&#39;m in love with this trailer. Not only made want to watch the movie but also learn more about the cultures and their history
Ranveer Singh Nailed it 🔥
Bgm amazing 💥
😈The Trailer described me the Hindutva 🕉🔥
This trailer, especially the music, gives me goosebumps even after 5 years
I gotta say, it does look like Tanishq&#39;s jewellery ads💀 I can&#39;t unsee it 😳
Years have passed, but this trailer still remains powerful!
Kash itna impress aadipurush bhi Karti
If you have roll of a king give it to shahid❤️
Mughalo ko apna jija banaya woh jhatput British ki g@nd ghulami kara woh jhatput 🤣
Propaganda film
Background music + khilji character, best of ranveer
Came here to clean my eyes after watching Adipurush

𝙢𝙖𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙥𝙞𝙚𝙘𝙚
Never forgot that first premiere show I watched in my life is Padmavat ! 24-Jan-2018
Ranveer Singh 🔥🔥🔥 is another level ❤️
what if Bhansali and rajamouli unite together for one single project
Still gives me goosebumps. Great cinematography, great music, the way shahid portrays Maharawal Ratan singh, fabulous.A masterpiece
Kon kon Manta hai adhipurush sirf rajamouli and bhansali sir hi  bana sakte the
Sanjay sir waiting for Tansen and Heeramandi 🥰
Better than adhipurush
It&#39;s been 4-5 years today but still I can see ppl commenting under a film&#39;s trailer! This is the level of acting, music, background score and story telling. This trailer is better than many many period dramas combined together! Just look at those lavish sets and setting of the scenes! Incredible! 🔥<br>Ranveer, Shahid and Deepika just lived and nailed their respective roles! Beyond words! <br>Hats off to the entire Padmavat team and specially SLB ❤️🙌🏻
Ye theme, actors and director ne ADI PURUSH banaya hota toh kya film banti. Usme sab joker dikh rahe hai. Prabhas,Saif sab. And vfz toh sabse Ganda Bollywood ka abhi tak ka 😄
Aadi purush ka teaser dekh ke asa laga mazzak Kiya hai un logo ne usme RAVAN ko joker banaya sirf socho padmavat nahi ye RAM SITA ki story hai and Khilji RAVAN bhai kya film banti. Padmavat ki story bakwaas thi lekin acting picturisation kya badhiya tha and adi purush ki story ❤️ hai and acting VFX direction gobar hai
बढ़िया फ़िल्म, 🏳️, संजय लीला बंसाली  बेस्ट इन हिंदी सिनेमा 🏳️
Adipursh se bhe best trailer
Best Trailer ever 2022 October ever seen
Love this music

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=121">2:01</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=126">2:06</a> goosebumps
In 2022 I am watching this trailer after found movie in Amazon prime ..background music and acting 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.
Anyone after bluesattai maran PS1 review
Goosebumps even after 4 years
Art direction in bhansali sir&#39;s movie are the best in the world. I have so seen so much hollywood movies, but in non I have seen this level of Art direction. The colors, the clothes,everything, simply outstanding.
It&#39;s been 4 years and yet i still come back to this
I became the Biggest fan of Deepika after watching this movie (I watched this movie     75 times)
I have studied history in yales and on other places and in this movie. Aludin had been seen so brutal. But he wasn&#39;t in reality
Hindu tan man Hindu jeevan <br>Rag rag Hindu Mera parichay 🔥
A complete masterpiece ❤
I&#39;m still watching in 2022 and getting goosbumpes 😍😍😍
this movie is incomplete without Ranveer Singh. once in a lifetime performance
Alauddin Khilji was a great king .But here in this movie he &#39;s described as a lunatic and aggresive king , that&#39;s not fare !
It&#39;s been half a decade since, but my gosh, the trailer still gives me goosebumps. When it comes to period drama, no one even comes close to Bhansali in Indian cinema today.
This movie creator is the dumbest person I have ever seen. Bloody bastard presented Alauddin Khilji as a negative character. Didn&#39;t you read the history before making this shit? Alauddin khiji was greatest warrior on his time . He never had any interest on that bullshit padmavat. Nonsense illiterate people r making joke india in front of the world.
better than PS1
Bhansali excell in visuals cinematography music art direction very well.
Make a movie on Veer Maharana pratap ji😌❤
Ultimately khilji got Padmavati....but king died ...LOL.
Agar Bhanghr Fort Par Film Banegi Toh SLB Sir Ko Hee Music And Direction Dena Chahiye It Will Be Most Most Most Historical Epic Periodic Horror Film Banni Chahiye.<br>Aur Agar Bhansali Aur SS Rajmauli Ek Saath Aaye Toh Box Office 💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💣💣💣💣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is exactly what a trailer should be, unlike other movies
That background score 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Background scenes ,bgm and ranveer singh acting  ❤❤
Very epic movie
The only character of Ranveer Singh I appreciate the most......he killed it ....just killed it💯💯
Jai rajputana
This movie is getting 5 yrs old!
I am from Tamil nadu . Today I have watch this patmaavat movie it&#39;s really awesome didn&#39;t miss this movie guys.I really likes ranveer singh  acting in this movie
Any telegram link for the movie ??
Cgi and vfx is crap🤣🤣🤣
Despite so much controversies on this movie at that time. This movie was well received by audiences and this movie managed to do well at the Box office.
❤
India k pass bauth si rania thi ,jo aapni kyi baato se mashoor thi par padmavati alag hi thi, I got goosebumps while seeing trailer and last scene in movie .     India have such a great history. I love this movie and add my favourite movies list, beacuse very few indian movies are my favourite . Hats off to PADMAVAT movie.
Best Indian movie ever
जय भवानी
peak days of bollywood..
Jisko dekhne ke liye iss movie main Allauddin Khilji(Ranveer Singh) tadap raha tha woh ab uska wife ban gaya hai 😂😂😂
Best movie trailer ever.
If padmaavati&#39;s role is played by kangana then this film is look like another level✨
Ranveer ko nanaga kyu itni badiya kaam kaar rahe ho..very bad 👎
ஜெயிலர் <br>புதுக்கோட்டை VC சினிமாஸ்
Appreciated trailer
Khya trailor tha iska🤗
A trailer where Ranveer Singh gave a vulgar smile for 2 seconds at 2.15, hence we came to know this will be a masterpiece, and rest we can see is history, hats off man
Best trailer of world
Prithvi Raj Chouhan project should have been given to Sanjay sir....he is one of the finest director industry have
Ranveer is marvelous in this! Shahid was just like a supporting actor with Deepika and Ranveer. He could have done better, or they could have cast someone else to match Khilji&#39;s charisma
That&#39;s why women shouldn&#39;t rule.. her decision to exile the enemy not only destroyed the kingdom but also caused early death of her husband and many men and women. That&#39;s why women shouldn&#39;t interfere in men&#39;s building.
Rawal Ratan Singh ❤️
Could someone write down what Deepika says at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=168">2:48</a> onwards ?
Yar yeh rajput akhir kis bat par etne raub zadte hai sale mughlo ke sanghi aaj filme bana banakar itihas ko dabane ke koshish karte hai yeh jo bhi rajput Raja tha esne sirf apne biwi ke liye apni jan di use kya pata hoga 1500 mai Mughal aur rajput milkar bacche paida karne wale hai
this movie gives me the feeling of womanhood. Dignity is higher than life...
original music of this trailer : go check main ost of &quot;Blood Simple&quot;
One of my favorites ❤
Movie mai best acting Ranbir singh and sahid kapoor
Awsome movie
It makes me cry:)))
padmavat kbhi bhi dekh lo frsh lgti h..prithviraj chauhan ne hug dia 🤣🤣
Just finished Prithviraj on prime and switched to the greatest movie of bhansali for refreshment. Every scene, bgm, songs, character, dialogue delivery is miles ahead than the bogus prithviraj movie. No one can match the accuracy and perfection of bhansali in historical movies. <br>Even the great hindu emperor can&#39;t praise this wasted prithviraj. 300crore wasted by Dr dwivedi. Had it been made by bhansali, and acted by the suited characters, this would have broken all records. Kudos to bhansali for refreshment. Especially the bgm gives goosebumps. Akshay sir, please this is not your cup of tea, you should carry on in social+entertainment genre. <br>In the last, ऐसी movies सिर्फ भंसाली जी को ही सुशोभित करती है।
alllahudin khilji great
Costumes and sets were better but samrat prithviraj showed true history but in padmavaat they showed alauddin stronger than rajputs and focused more on alauddin than Rani padmini
When i look back to our history, i saw this 🔥🔥🔥
They only show muslims are bad, Alaudin was great leader but these always try show muslims are bad, Don&#39;t forget he is the father of Jalal-ud-din Khalji who saved india from mongols
Shahid Kapoor | Deepika Padukone❤️❤️❤️
After seeing that trailer I am thinking where is that old bollywood lost🥺
This was a beautiful film. It has the essence of an epic.
Only Rajputs
Fighting without your head, sacrificing your life for pride, paying the ultimate price for self respect, this is kshatriya dharm and this is what a kshatriya woman &quot;chhatrani&quot; do to save her pride
After seeing the trailer so many times, finally I have decided to watch the film. And I realize that, it’s a worst film ever made by Bansali. The visual effects, casting, plot all makes me so disappointed. I was the biggest follower of Bansali since &quot;Ham dil de chuke Sanam&quot;
* Like * &lt;3 Deepika &lt;3
Ranveer is legend
Ye movie to dil pe raaj kar gai.
Bajirao Mastani - OK trailer - Great movie<br>Padmavat - Great trailer - OK movie <br>Both movies - Excellent songs
Bhansali needs to be worried about his future , since India’s future can’t be allowed to be shown as any fictional or any dramatic game .
Came back here in June 2022. Still getting the same vibes, chills &amp; goosebumps.
Elite level bgm 💫💫
Allauddin khilji
Ranveer. Nailed it!!
Akshay Kumar&#39;s acting in samrat Prathviraj movie  is not even near to the Shahid Kapoor&#39;s performance in padmavat as a great Hindu Rajput Ruler.<br>⚔️<br>Akshay lost a great opportunity..👎<br>He can do way batter than he actually did if he worked hard and took some time..
He was such a doofus though - all stuck on &quot;purity&quot; and morals or something where what was really needed was cunning, strategy and force to outwit and fight the invaders.  The rajput leader just fed himself and his people to the slaughter.  <br><br>He was the leader of his people and he thinks war is played &quot;honorably&quot;.  Fatal and irresponsible naivete, ego and false pride. <br><br>I&#39;ll meet you in battle - just as soon as my pure wife hand sews jewels into my turban next to our sun dappled fountain.  Oh, I&#39;ve got to be perfumed too.  Okay, now I will parade out with my royal battalion where we will be a model to the world of good hygiene, tailoring and manners.<br><br>Oops. I&#39;ve been captured and now me and my entire people will all be conquered and die.<br><br>...&quot;a Rajput&#39;s bangle has the same strength as a Rajput&#39;s sword&quot;. Yup. Pretty much.  Make sure you go into war with all the right bangles! 👍😁😂😮😳😭
Best historical movie from India by far <br><br>Just because of its music and It really gives the atmosphere of that time
Here after watching prithviraj got little disappointed but now I&#39;m feeling good
Khilji ki wajah se chali or aaj parthvi raj hal bura hua
All director who create historical drama... Should learn the tectic from SLB... Boss is always boss..  Hats of SLB
The Last Great Historical Movie made by Indian Cinema 🎥 🥲🥲🥲🥲
Khilji ko padmaavti nahi mili par ranveer ko deepika mil gyi
This trailer gives me goosebumps and pumps me up 💪
MY GOD !! this is just perfect . i can watch this trailer infinite time . everything is so so perfect . sanjay leela bhansali is god director in period drama movies in entire india
mai toh varun grower ko dekhne k baad yahan aaya
I  love this movie what a masterpiece
Prathviraj se achi movie h
after watching today samrat prithviraj please isss movie ko dobara release kro 😭 shahid rajput character is much better than whole movie samrat prithviraj
Probably one of the best movie of the decade
this trailer was better than the whole “Samrat Prithviraj”film.
It&#39;s been 4 years. I watch this trailer quite often. Music, dialogue, pride, so fineee
I came here after watching Prithviraj trailer and this  is still 10 times better 😅
After prithviraj I understand that shahid had done 1000% better than Akshay kumar
Sir prithviraj maharaj p movie apko bnani chahiye the inhone to tatti bna di
But samrat prithviraj ke sath galat  release ho rahi hai . Ye galat baat hai.<br><br>Pehli baar koi hindu ya orignal Indian  samrat pe Itni badi movie ban rahai support to usko karna chahiye jisse or yesi flim Bane .<br><br>Army wali movie to wese bhi hit hoti hai.<br><br>Par iska release date galat hai.
i like the movie trailer music.
Background music
Movie see me
I am a student and I am studying about allauddin khilji now but when I have seen padmavaat I felt it easy to study
please upload this 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏movie in 3d format
People in future how Shahid was actually the underdog in the movie .. a performance filled with Silence yet so Powerful .. yes Ranveer was Brilliant .. Yes he had the best role in the movie .. But Shahid left his presence in the best way he could
Just a trailer, but so much power!!!!
I just love this trailer and watch it again and again background music is absolutely top notch it just elevates your energy makes you feel better
this is where one chooses the best actors n movies become a succ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=108">1:48</a> Ranveer’s  expression better than Akshey kumar whole prithviraj movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=112">1:52</a> Just that expression is too much of acting
what a masterpiece of a trailer
Wt yrrr wt wt is reality wt they show
I watch this trailer everytime jus to have goosebumps when ranveer evil laughs
came here to watch trailer after watching prithviraj chauhan trailer.....every actor involved in padmavati, Bajirao Mastani, manikarnika are superbbb.... fell bad for the legend prithviraj chauhan ji😔 played by akshay kumar 😔😔
Ham bataye isme kuch khas nahi laga hamko 😂 faltu me sab prithviraj ko troll kar rhe agar wo flop hua na tab Indian audience hindu centric film deserve nhi karti, islog ko wahi akbar aur khilji ko dekhe milega
After these 4 years of this movie. I can&#39;t agree more that this is the best trailer anyone could make.
Background Music is enough for goosebumps
We want this type of movie more! ❤️
⚡
It&#39;s 2023 and still a masterpiece. No movie can beat Padmaavat. Still gives me goosebumps.

Here after Akshay Kumar and manusi tattiii
Sanjay leeela bhansali is true artist!
After watching prithviraj trailer I realised that was so so disappointing and failed completely in portraying the mightness of  great Prithviraj Rah Chauhan , then came to this omg no one beats Sanjay Leela Bhansali in historical and larger than life movies in Bollywood , What a masterpiece it is in every department  and Ranvir has given the performance of his life , This is called real historical Drama  .Period!
Is movie ko phirse release hona chayhe abhi🔥
No one can match Bhansali Productions&#39; Cinematography level!<br>Like if you agree
Who came back to appreciate this piece of work even more after watching latest trailer of prithviraj?
Here after prithvi raj trailer still got goosebumps watching this♥️

Still better trailer than Prithviraj (I am not comparing movie only trailer)
Compare this to prithviraj Chauhan trailer
Just came back to check where Prithviraj went wrong....😑
I am here after watching the Pritviraj Trailer better than that trailer is watching this masterpiece ❤️❤️
Came here after watching aweful trailer of Prithviraj chauhan..just to recover myself..😉
Better than prithviraj chohan tralier 2022
Just came back after watching samrat prithviraj trailer of yrf ,to watch this trailer which gives total chills and goosebumps rather than that trailer which couldn&#39;t do justice but I am hopeful that somehow movie came to be good in storytelling and giving due respect to Samrat Prithiviraj ji
Just came to refresh my mind and eyes after watching Garbage trailer of Prithiviraj Chauhan this is how a trailer should be made 🔥 !
This trailer still gives the same amount of goosebumps.
Music, cinematography, action and acting all are top notch. Except sanjai Leela Bhansali No one can make best historical movie.
Here after Tried and refused production&#39;s review on Prithviraj trailer.<br>He is so right about the colour pallet and the BGM .<br>Prithviraj&#39;s Trailer is just yellow while this Trailer shows all the vibrant colours that india is always known for and while the Prithviraj&#39;s Trailer has been cut out with few love and war scenes put togather with the main BGM hoping it would create excitement in Audience, this Trailer has each and every scene cut in to this Trailer to go smooth with the BGM and rather complement it and the scenes, even though, shows the intensity of the movie, doesn&#39;t actually Revel much about it.<br>I didn&#39;t watch the trailer as life was busy around that time but watch the movie later with friend and didnt notice all this about the trailer but Bravo to the team who cut such a creative trailer.
Prithviraj trailer is no where in front of padmavat..
Prithiviraj trailer looks nothing in front if this epic trailer.
Revisiting this masterpiece after Prithviraj trailer launch and boy that isn’t even close to this. I got goosebumps even after 4 years of this being created.
This trailer is something different <br>Still give goosebumps
After watching the prithviraj trailer,I realised how good of a trailer this is.
This was honestly one of the best trailers for an Indian movie I have ever watched. The basic storyline was known to most people, so instead of making it a montage of different scenes telling the story, they made this beautiful choreography. Even though it doesn&#39;t tell you much, it makes you feel all of the emotions of the movie. Period films today should learn from this that a good historical film is more than big budgets and stars.
1000 times better than Prithviraj Chauhan
Who is here after Prithviraj Chauhan trailer
Who came after prithwiraj...to see legacy of sanjay leela bhansali
Who are here after watching pruthvi Raj Chauhan trailer, hit like!

Still the best trailer to ever come out of an Indian movie. Literal goosebumps even after 4 years.
Bakawas movie.. they do not know how to make action sense🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️<br>Sanjay Bansali suits to make only love stories..<br>Learn from Rajamouli..<br><br>After watching those action scenes 🤣🤣🤣🤣Like comedy serials..
Movie link plz..
Survival of the fittest
Rajputi kangan main utni takat hai jitni rajputi talwar mein <br>Dialogue Fabulous 😍🥰
I think this is the best trailer.... The film was a bit underwhelming but the trailer alone would have got Oscar
Back Ground Music
Sanjay sir huge fan but sory to say but you disappointed me in this movie so much<br>1st half was well made<br>But 2nd half felt so slow and fake some where.<br>Ranveer Singh is good actor but some where acted over<br>And in first he was so badass and villainous but in second half he lost his character.<br>Sim&#39;s acting was so fabulous but his story felt Incomplete.<br>Sorry Dipu but you   didn&#39;t put any  afford in  your character you  was so unrelatable in this movie ..<br>Only Aditi&#39;s acting and character felt perfect. ..<br>Music and set was mesmerizing...<br>But Story would be better...

Allahuddin khilji zindabad
Behtareen movie
Some of the shorts are exact remake of the movie &quot;The Troy&quot;. Can be easily guessed. Bollywood people are really *true dumb*. They prove the world that they are so dumb that they can&#39;t even make an original indian movie plot. They have zero innovation capability and are the best in copying others. Tollywood is class apart in innovation and have no match.
Bhai is bachche ko Rajput ka role de diya, chahe Kitna bhi make up kar lo. Ye Rajput jaisa tall, broad chest and masculine lagega hi nahi. Ye Sahid fukrey wale role me hi achcha Lagta hai. Ganjedi,  Nasedi, Bewada types movies, doing smacks, smoking joint, snorting powder and all. Ye character bahut over matured actor chahiye. Baaki Deepika ab  budhiya ho chuki hai, Body me maans thode bahot maans Latak rahe hain. Chusdi ho chuki hai wo. We can only see a bone stature standing and walking. It&#39;s time, c must plan for her retirement or better suitable roles further.  <br><br>Last but not the least, Rajput ayaash aur ishqbaaz nahi the. They were shouldering great responsibility of their mother land and men. Shedding their blood fighting against foreign invasion.
Jai rajputana
Re-release it in theaters!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rani sa tu aag sa balkha raani sa badal sa garja Rani sa rajputi shaan hai raani saa mari aan baan hai
Itne mahan yoddha ki history Puri jhuti dikhayi gyi hai allauddin khilji agar na hote to Bharat kab ka mongol ke hath me hota
Best movie so far
Here after TVF&#39;s bachelors vs games
Alaudin khilji is always powerful
Make a film on Sikhs also
Khiljiyo ka parcham buland rahe
Full badass acting by Ranveer Singh💥
jai rajputana
Ranveer killed it
This is enough for goosebumps :<br> <br>Chinta ko talwar ki nok pe rakhe, woh RAJPUT ... ret ki naav lekar samundar se shart lagaye, woh RAJPUT ... aur jiska sar kate phir bhi dhad dushman se ladta rahe, woh RAJPUT<br><br><br>The one who keeps worry on the edge of his sword, is a RAJPUT  ... the one who bets against the ocean in a boat made from sand, is a RAJPUT  ... and the one who keeps on fighting with his enemy even after his head is chopped off, is a RAJPUT.
Solid Action Movie
Queen padmavati was reborn draupadi because she born in fire but didn&#39;t dead in fire so she reborn as queen padmavati and sacrifice herself in fire. To end her born and die and reborn and die cyle(life cyle)
Shahid kapoor and Ranveer singh has diffrent level of acting skills
Kasp
Portraying Allaundin Khilji&#39;s character in this movie is FAKE, At the first Even I did believe about what they&#39;ve shown about khilji in this movie later I researched every possible information about it.. Then I got to know They have Shown Very FAKE Image of Allaudin Khilji I recommend you guys to know about his real history (I don&#39;t know what is the purpose behind this that they&#39;ve shown totally opposite image of khilji) 😂 I stopped watching bollywood history movies.
Who is here after gangubai trailer ??<br>Deepika padukone and bhansali are the best didn&#39;t liked gangu&#39;s trailer that much
This trailer has the power to take you back in history... Goosebumps!!!
Each and every character in this movie was perfect... it&#39;s almost like they were made to do this movie
2022 its still magic
The problem with this was, Sanjay&#39;s obssesion with negative publicity. This what leaded to controversies.<br>Beside that ,<br>As a RAJPUT i say this was a masterpiece .... just with few mistakes which could be corrected!
Kathiyawadi talking Marathi accent loloxxx cartoon Alia disaster movie
Goosebumps every single time.... Bhansali is god.... Seriously... What a guy<br>.
Jai Rajputana 💪🚩🚩🙏🙏 proud to be a rajput
film&#39;s duration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=9808">02:43:28</a>
Deepika&#39;s eyes are enough to express her feelings ❤️
Everyone praised Ranveer&#39;s badass character but no one noticed how courageous , attitude and brave character was of Sahid . And after this war Alaudin killed 30000 hindu&#39;s in chitod . Thankfully mevar was taken back by brother of Ratan singh otherwise i can&#39;t imagine how mevar would look today .Tribute to all Rajput warrior&#39;s who sacrificed their life for their motherland . world is literally forgetting what they did . We will praise that khilji who killed thousand&#39;s of Hindu but would never appreciate Rani Padmani for her sacrifice and Ratan singh who fought war even knowing he will not return back. Amar rahae vo veer saput . Jay Bhavani , Jay Mataji , Har Har Mahadev .
Thoroughly enjoyed this movie <br>👍🏽👍🏽
Film ka ashli hero too Alauddin hai
Ranveer singh 🔥🔥🔥
I like how apart from that Rajput dialogue, there were dialogues in the trailer...the visuals alone are enough to feel
The Rajput female bracelet is as strong as the sword of a rajput ⚔️
Shahid Kapoor, man what a character in this movie.<br><br>This is very well made.
Ranveersingh 💎❤️🙏
almost all rajpoot worked under mughals😂 and they sell us this fake fantasy pride image

Indian culture is mystery, history <br>No culture can match it
Villain entry!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Watching in 2022 again ♥️♥️♥️
Bekaar movie hai Alauddin khilji k kirdaar ko galat dikhaya hai jiska history se koi lena dena nhi hai apne hisaab se chipka diya sab
WHAT A GREAT WARRIOR INDIA HAVE... LOVE AND RESPECT FROM USA
Allah u akbar
SLB films, music, story literally everything has such a grand and amazing feel to them just amazing!
Favorite bgm in ever ❤️🔥
Aaje bee yaad hai kyaa dhmaal macha yaa thaaa 😂😂😂😂😂2k21
What a theme yr most powerful...
Last Me ye toh dikha ne ka Ki Kaise Malik Kapoor ne Aaladdin khilji ko mara Tha Toh Orr Movie hit Hoti
🚩🚩🔱🚩Jai Bhavani🕉🚩🔱🚩🚩🚩
For the first time in my life i got Goosebumps while watching it (particularly when rani went for Johar and jai bhavani was wowing around the fort)
This movie has a lot of historical inaccuracies.
Sahid kapoor was not given too much credit for his portrayal of role as Raja Ratan Singh. Even though he was more senior actor than Deepika and Ranveer. All the limelight and praise has been taken away by both.
Ratan Singh should not have married Padmavati as he was already married. Great movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=57">00:57</a> iam literally scared when ranveer entered
हर हर महादेव!
Its an awesome movie👌👌<br>Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩❤
Love for lndia <br>From Pakistan occupied Sindhudesh
Still, I am coming here just to listen the back ground music.... Awesome...
This is the best trailer of Bollywood. Hands down.
Agar Mughalo k time v pahari Rajput na , Sikho k Guru, Guru Gobind say khilaf na ladda k agar Guru Maharaj Ka sath Deyya hota to hum ko itna saal gulam nhi rehna parta
Plz upload full movie
If RamCharan and Raana acted in this movie...verey level in south India
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=108">1:48</a> what a entry khiljii ❤️
This movie cant be touch the success of Bahubali
Bollywood meaning to history distort. alauddin khilji 6 time saved whole india.with mongoliya.
Background music is so good..
Alauddin the greatest SIMP of all time
I can Only Imagine Hrithik Roshan as Allahuddin Khilji, he deserved this film<br><br>Greatest Trailer ever made in Indian Cinemas 😎
What makes the rajput warrior sad gives pleasure to the Mughals killers <br><br>We fought what was in front of us not because we hated them but because we love what was behind us
Just close eyes nd listen to the sound... The music ufff🔥🔥
Totally Fake Allauddin Khilji Ko Bohot Glt Dikhaya Gya Hai Iss Movie Mai Totally Fake Movie...!
If not best, it is one of the best bollywood trailer I have seen.
The deepika padukone , the benchmark for periodic films the GOAT actress the queen of bollywood. She nailed it as rani padmavati👑
Just come back here frequently to feel the background music 🎶
Fun fact: Padmavat married to Alauddin Khilji (Deepika-Ranveer) 😂🤣😂🤣
My favourite Historical movie
Wish they release the OST on Spotify !!!!!
Bhansali you are great man , Historical movie tumhi bna skte ho , excellent trailer and excellent background music
Now after 4 years when i see this trailor, I realise what a great man SLB is, There could be more historical movies like Panipat, Prithviraj but none could touch this era, this legacy, This acting, Padmavat always will be the landmark in indian cinema
This trailer is way better than prithviraj

Just now watched all the trailers including bhahubali and kgf ..but this trailer with bgm are next level. goosebumps type 🔥🔥
The great Sultan Alauddin Khilji, who saved India from the Mongols by defeating the mighty Mongols three times without caring for his own life, turned the great Sultan Alauddin Khilji into a villain, a bloodthirsty savage. Should be ashamed. Long live Sultan Alauddin Khilji The great.✊
Ranveer Singh is the king👑
iğrenç bi film müslümanları kötü gösterdiğiniz yetmiyor bok gibi bitirmişsiniz yazık vallaha burda boynum tutuldu  üç saattir izliycem diye iğrenç  iğrenç bok gibi bok
stumbled upon a bass boosted video with the sultan dance scene so I watched the movie believing it would be fun and what a surprise that movie is incredibly well written and realised, the characters nevers makes choices that breaks their personality and that makes that movie looks so realistic<br>Definitely one of my favorite
jay RAJPUTANA 🚩🚩🚩 Jay maa Padmini jay maa bhawani

Background music 🎶❤ lovedd ittt 🥺🥺
Larger than life canvas
For those of you who don’t know this movie is fictional. Historians have said there’s no proof of a women named padmavati. This story is based on a poem written by a Muslim Sufi saint. In this movie the Muslim ruler Aladdin khilji is portrayed as a beastly conquerer while in reality he was a great man. He was the reason why the mongols couldn’t take india. He slayed the mongols and made towers from the chopped heads. The mongols feared him. So sad to see him being portrayed in such a negative way.
bollywood needs to produce good movie in other regional and foiregn lanaguage like english , portugese, spanish , turkish , mandarin , russian , japanese so that non indian viewwer could also watch
No one can beat role of alludin khilji &amp; ratan singh
Agar kise k pass full movie ha plz send me
How can I find full mivie
Mughals zindabad♥️ sultan khilji
ख़िलजीयों का परचम बुलंद हो

Sultan Alauddin Khilji <br>Proud to be Khilji <br>Proud to be Afghan
जय भवानी जय राजपुताना।<br>जय हिन्द जय भारत।<br>राजपूत कभी छल नहीं करता और विदेशी आक्रमणकारियों ने बिना छल के कोई युद्ध नहीं जीता परन्तु जब तक हमारे बीच जयचंद रहेंगे तब तक ऐसा होता रहेगा
They Potared Allahudun khilji in a wrong way☹️ heartbreaking💔 he was a great king
No way I liked villain Khalji more than hero
Terrorist islams destroyed a beautiful kingdom😭
This movie how indian respect his females and how great our culture proud to be indian 🙏🏼
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=164">2:44</a> one of most beautyfull and excelent shots I´ve ever seen
Fuck islam 😠
Ranveer singh is a bollywood ... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Malik Mohammad jaisi ki likhi joothi kahani jo sultan e hind allauddin ki izzat par dag laga raha ha
This is not true story. Alauddin Khilji were truthful and respectful. He was best man. I’m Khilji  Afghan Pashtoon. In Afghanistan are now Khiljis Ghiljid   Proud to be Khilji Ghilji ❤️❤️🇦🇫🇦🇫
Sultan alauddin khilji🦁🦁🦁 Islam ka  parcham Buland Rahe

Aalaudin.Khilji🌙
Only in trailer ranveer looking greater than Shahid but in movie shahid acting and performance of chittorh king is awesome
Bakwas h
This is the best trailer of a bollywood movie.... change my mind ? 👇
Background 🔥🔥🔥
Why aditi rao is not even shown in the trailer? She&#39;s such a great actress
The highest-grossing Indian film to portray Afghans. The film became the 7th highest-grossing Indian film of all time at one stage.
Superb movie hai or  songs bhi mst h
Jai Mewar 🚩
Khilji ne gaand faad dii
Ye radhe movie dekh ke detoxification ke liye aaya tha main... Ab pehle se better feel kar rha hoon
Sam padmavat real khaninki copy same good
Badass khilji ❤️❤️
Gora badal are great warriors .
Ranveer did a great job in this masterpiece movie
One of the Best movie I have ever seen in my life. ❤️❤️ Jai bhawani.<br><br><br><br><br>11:32pm<br>Tuesday 25 May 2021
Pehle Main History subject se bahut Darta tha...<br>Phir mausi ne kaha - Bhansali ki movies dekha karo..<br>Ab mujhe History padhne mein majaa aane laga,<br>Hats off Bhansali Sir.. 😍😍😍
Background is awesome😍😍
Shahid kapoor is best
Harami deepika said that muze chote actor ke sath kaam ni krne ka nhi toh SSR hote the shahid ke place pr
I am American and went to see this movie for the first time while in Delhi. I couldn&#39;t understand a word but had read the plot beforehand so I could follow along. I have since bought the movie and watched it multiple times with subtitles. It is one of my favorite movies of all time
Kon kon beckground music ke liye aya hai
Jinti baar dakhu mohabbat ho jati hai.Raja or Rani ka pyar  itni achi lagi or unka atmabalidan dakh ke man dukhi ho jata hai.Kash Khilji na aya hota or unke pyar ko aise nazar na lagti.
Tanishq add 🤣🤣😂
Music is ocm
I watched 20 times.Very beautiful movie.historical movie 👍.
Acting guru ranveer singh
Jai rajputana jai MAA Bhavani 🚩🕉️⚔️⚔️⚔️⚔️⚔️
Shahid Kapoor no where resembles Rajput king ..Body language not infusing any energy..Deepika and Ranveer was at different level
next movie about Babar 😍
I waching today this one again 👍
Good movie but they show Allauddin Khilji character so negative, well he was winning and aggressive but it is too much. He saved India🇮🇳 from Mangols, who destroyed Asia from Mongolia- China to Turkey. They(rulers like Khilji and  MUGHALS) didn&#39;t come to return, they came for stay. They don&#39;t rob they made India beautiful.
Jabtk cinema hai log Chutiya bante rahenge.. <br>Padmavati n Alauddin khilji belonged to different times.. <br>But ab nikammi sarkar ka agenda set krne k liye kisi ko bhi villain bana do..
The actual practice is known as saka. It has two parts kesariya done by men and women commit jauhar. Both wear their marriage dress. Men wear kesariya headgear/safa. Women wear their marriage dress along with all jewellery. <br><br>Saka is committed when defeat is certain and all belive that they will be together after death that&#39;s why their marriage dress.<br>If kesariya and jauhar both takes place it is full saka. If only one takes place it&#39;s half saka.<br>Death before dishonour....
Haram khor khilji
Beautiful<br>❤️❤️
One of the best movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=108">1:48</a>

Who still come here👍
What kind of  bullshit is this.. the one who lost the war is glorified..
Can anyone tell where can I watch this for free
Is Khilji ko humare Shivji Raje se panga lena chahiye tha 😂😂😂 marane ke baad pachatata ki maine dharati par janma hi kiu liya tha 😂😂😂 arongjeb ki taraha usaki bhi kabra MH mai kahi hoti 😂😂😂
Everyone  says that this movie shows a bad a image of the Rajputs and Rani Padmavati, but the fact is that this movie has shown more negative things about the Khiljis.<br>But no one cares.
Amazing
It&#39;s a thanishq add - varun Grover 😂 💯

RAJPUT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ye lgta hai ki history nhi pdhte Hain sab, Jo khilji Jo tha o ek yodha tha wo kisi padmavati ke chakkar mein nhi tha, kya kya ye dikhate rhte Hain sab, padmavati Ka naam h nhi hai
Just imagine that you seeing this after 20 year&#39;s with your kids and you telling them that the actress who played the role of padmavati she actually did marry with khilji
hindus ki 3rd  soch ... Padmaavat aik fabricated aur jhooti story .... alaudin khilji legand banda tha
Ranveersingh what a acting another level 🔥🔥🔥this movie
I thought this movie is based on real event at first. Dissapointed.

Fucked movie  false story

I am also a khilji by cast
Khilji wearing that woolen coat in the burning summers of Chittor is one of the mistakes that bhansali should work on
Kaash Sanjay Leela Bhansali ji aissi historical movies aur banate<br>Lekin hamare so called activitist kaha banane dete Hein<br>My All time favourite movie ☺☺☺
India indeed has rich and interesting history. I love India
JAI RAJPUTANA☺️
Proud to be a Rajput.🚩🔥🔥

Ranveer singh expression at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=154">2:34</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0&amp;t=155">2:35</a> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shahid kapoor entire trailer reaction...
Such a long definition of Rajputs! In reality, spineless selfish people who instead of uniting and fighting Mughals and British laid down their weapons and made deals with them.  Wonder what Maharana Pratap would have said had he been alive. He&#39;s the true Rajput!
Sultan Khilji expanded Delhi sultanate. His policies brought economic reforms and saved India from famine. And most importantly, He saved India from Mongols, not just once, just 6 times. If Mongols would have captured India, so Britishers might have never came to India cause then there would be nothing left for Britisher.<br>This padmawat movie is just a fictional story. Nothing like this happened in reality.<br>Sultana Khilji ❤️
Epic .....From music to acting to storytelling...All is awesome
Alauddin khilji ke baare me kitna galat dikhaya gaya hai.
Sanjay Leela Bhansali has Made Ranveer &amp; Deepika even better actors, by directing them in 3 masterpieces- Ramleela, BM &amp; this ✨😍
No one was less
this movie was made for sushant.he was a true RAJPUTH
Who is here after kgf chapter 2 😁😁
Who&#39;s else watching this trailer in 2021 just to listen background score  ?
Chuiya hite h raj put
Fake history shown by director 👎👎👎👎👎
Jai maa padmini ❤❤
Ranveer nailed it
Jai bhavani ❤
Khilji saved india 5times from mongols... Nd history puri bdl k rkhdi..
Mongols jinki vjh s dunia kapti thi, khilji was d only prsn who faced against dem stronly. Mongols got shiver only frm his nme.. He had dat power
Protest muslims ko krna tha,,, Alauddin asa tha hi nhi in reality.. He was not intrstd in kafoor.. Salo n history bdl k rkhdi.. Protest rajputo n kia😂
Sanjay Leela bhansali supper bgm music and dairction
Ranveer Singh 🔥
Who is here in 2021 after the trailer of Gangubai Kathiawari to get out from the depression 😂
How many are here to relive padmaavat vibes again
why dont he write story screenplay direction and music by SLB . is he downto earth or too modest to accept that he has done so much .  Usually people crave for attention but look at this man Sanjay leela Bhansaali , even after giving a award winning BGD did not mention his name in the Trailer . just production and directoion . thats it .. too cool for craze SLB
Finally watched this and was bawling my eyes out at the end . That last scene was truly heartwretching 😭❤️. Such brave women. The whole production and the acting are absolutely gorgeous.
khilji steals the show
Jai rajputana
Only bahubali best
Disaster film
Average film
Who thinks that, Deepika should be in Gangubai kathiawadi&#39;s role?
Yesterday Gangubai Kathiyawadi trailer was released. But i am still here.
Entry ❤️ Ranveer
This film was not true
Who is here after watching Gangubai Kathiawadi teaser? You cannot deny that Gangubai Kathiawadi is not as grand, beautiful, hair-raising and moving like the trailer of Padmavati. Hit like if you agree!
💓💓💓🔱🔱🔱

This trailer is so well made, it&#39;s actually genius. The acting in this movie was good, I thought it was gonna be bad but it turned out to be amazing, I highly recommend this
in indian movie , all about islam is bad and weak , even in historical book wrote that islam win war but in movie hindu win war , have you guys read historical book or not ?
This movie has the Best Climax and Background Score of all time. Period
After 3 year just to look one of best trailers
Yabancı dizidir
JUST ONE WORD &quot;GOOSEBUMPS&quot; 🔥
Watching this trailer in 2021 and still gives goosebumps 🔥
2021?
Am I alone here after Varun Grover&#39;s tanishq ad
Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a gem, he literally got the perfect cast, and what can  I say about the screenplay. Fantabulous
All rajput intrested in this movie.... To watch... Is it true?
Rajput history is great Maharana Pratap, prithvi raj chauhan all are great warrior salute to them🙏
Special thanks to music and cinematography and make up artist ♥️<br>Great movie 👍
I don&#39;t like allauddin Khilji but he saved us from the mongol invasion
jitne baar bhi dekho goosebumps aa jate h
background score 💞
3 saal pahale theater me dekhi thi movie 😄 fully pesa basul movie 😘
By deepika’s name is last in the credits?
3 sal guzar gye lekin abi b Ranveer singh ki entry or background music sunne ata hu💙🔥
Ranveer, u will be a legend actor like amitabh ji
Deepika was paid more than Sk and Rs for this movie. ❤️🙌🏻 happy 3 years of this magnificent movie
I just came out of nowhere to watch one the best Bollywood trailers of all time :&#39;)
Ultimate movie alludin khiliji ultimate and ratan singh
BGM filled with whole historical glory🧡
That humming is so good
Boycott Shahid Kapoor and support Ranveer Singh
Background music 🔥🔥
Ranveer sing and background music 🔥🔥🔥
It&#39;s been 3 years but still this trailer brings goosebumps ❤️
Only legends see in 2021
Maine 12 Jan 2021 ko chittorhgarh fort fort me visit Kiya .I realy shocked after watched fort .love+intrust it.
Good music background......
bakwas
Ranveer Singh 🔥<br>You are fabulous actor.....
The movie portrays how wars affects life of women ... Whether it be Padmavati and all women of Mewar and Mehrunnisa who stripped of her powers and send to dungeon ... Women and children suffers a lot due to wars .. whether it is for greed or bravery  of men the losers are women always ...
Idk why no one complimented Deepika
Perfect 👏❤
Music is just epic🤐🤐
Shahid role kya bolu ab shabd nahi mere pas
bakwas
Rajput 🔥
Namma Kannada cinema KGF 2
Ye tanish jewelery ka ad kyu aa raha hai padmati key trailer mey 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shahid Kapoor ke vajah randip huda Lena chahiye tha.
still i come here again n again for the background music
bgm is on another level
Alaudiin entry daring 😎
Goosebumps even after watching it for the hundredth time .. what a visual piece of art ❤️❤️❤️
Didn’t both of the leads in this film star as leads together in another film (I can’t remember the name, but it was based off of Romeo and Juliet and there were guns and stuff. I’m sorry, I don’t know a lot about Indian films)
rajputo se assi laraie toh daccanio ne lari
Propaganda movie, Alluadin was a Good Man, Our Hero Allaudin💪
Only trailer in which bgm speaks more than actors
Deepika and shahid have a unbeatable chemistry
Such a crap movie nd worst part was promoting the wrong concept of the negative element of movie, rather than  promoting Shahid kapoor(Ratan singh) because of whom significance of Padmavati actually exist.,they promoting ranveer singh(Khaal drogo) ...... 🤣🤣
The humming sound at 0.35sec is stripped from Ben Howard&#39;s song evergreen. Connect the dots now, that song evergreen was Sushant&#39;s favourite song.<br>For me, Sushant lives on in the consecration of our hearts. 🙏🦋🌪️🌌♾️♾️♾️
Disgusting
Coming here all the time for the background Score ❤ especially from 0.56
Jay Rajputana 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
Manikarnika is far better than this shitty movie deepika doesnt even know how to act properly bloody drug addict🤮🤮🤮
R
Epic .Sanjay Leela Bhansali at its best ......
It&#39;s visual treat 😉
Alauddin Khilji was one of the most powerful nd honest emperor,,,jaahilon jaake history dekho
Ye maharana Pratap pe bana hi
Here again for the background score and of course RS!
Who the he&#39;ll r disliking this vedio will go to hell
Ye kahani to Malik Muhammad jaysi par banaya gaya hai
Fake story
Fake movie
Still get goosebumps !!!
If the actress was <b>&quot;madhuri dixit&quot;</b> as padmavati.
Jai Rajasthan jai rajputana
Based on a true story<br>This is one of the best movies I’ve ever seen. My husband is from India in northern Punjab. I really liked seeing the traditional clothing and a woman who is a brave warrior alongside her husband who fights in battle against a crazed maniac that is hell-bent on seeing his wife;  what takes place within this movie is amazing I really enjoyed watching it from beginning to end it is a long movie, but well worth it; loved it. It’s a great  This movie is for men and women. I give it a TEN 10
The subtitles are so basic, they do absolutely no justice to the beautiful dialogues of the film.
Kabir singh😉
Sad for politics happen
Beautiful movie n music
This looks excellent, unfortunately I only speak English though. Does anyone know of a dubbed version available anywhere? Thank you.
I wanted to See Sushant Singh Rajput as the Rajput king in this movie...
Say what you will about the themes explored and other things in the movie. But this trailer is so well made and edited. Just one score that starts somber and elevates till the end, with only a couple of dialogues interspersed between. Masterful.
is no one gonna talk about effort made by ranveer and shahid.
Khilji is 🙌🙌🙌🙌
Rajput
Who came here after Sushant Singh Rajput demise
Be a hindu and indian <br>Before it&#39;s too late and support who stand for us<br>No caste only Hinduism<br>Jai Hind
Best historical movie 👑👑👑
This movies is reason why I started loving my nation&#39;s history more than ever before.....
Who is here from Karni Sena 😁🙏
Superb choice necles<br>N
Padmaavat n Bahubali, Both the Masterpieces would not be Same Without thier&#39;s Epic BGM👌👌
One the best trailer I&#39;ve ever seen ! The bgm gives pure Rajasthani feeling and almost every scene is like a painting and takes us back to 13th century now thats what we call Great cinematography and direction ! Bhansali should start a series on Indian warriors
Ghani Ghani Khama 🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼
Best Vai Best 💛💥
