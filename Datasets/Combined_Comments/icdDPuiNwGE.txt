Holy shit I forgot about the COPPA
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=825">13:45</a> :(
Leaving this comment to remind you that this video is 3 years old now. üíÄ
I like how &quot;misgendering&quot; (aka using biologically correct pronouns) is now considered a hate crime. The alphabet soup truly is bowed down to on a daily basis.
I have hope seeing you right now. Most amazing at your bestest. <a href="UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/mSzlXqyICJbI1wLlxqPYBQ"></a>
I‚Äôm thinking about the kids who make videos and say ‚ÄúI wanna do Youtube for real!‚Äù While their family is barely paying to keep them alive and all of a sudden the FTC comes in and sues them a billion dollars and puts the family into more poverty.
Imagine meatcanyon getting flagged &quot;for kids&quot;
I miss the &quot;Go fuck yourself&quot; Pewdiepie. üò∂üëç
Pewds is a magician, I am going to be 19 years old after 3 days.

Miss old YouTube when you can swear. Just like this world everything is becoming soft now
booooo dislike this video subscribe to morgzzzz!!!!!
&quot;dumbass anime avatar kids&quot; is the highlight of triggered users on any platform
Downfall of YT...
The dude who said they would sue personal channels is such a punk.
Then what about coco melon shouldn&#39;t they be cancelled then
75% of parents shouldn&#39;t be parents
AS A TRANS PERSON I REALIZE THAT PEWDS MADE AN HONEST MISTAKE. THOSE IDIOTS ON TWITTER ARE JUST THAT. IDIOTS. I HATE PEOPLE LIKE THAT. if someone misgenders me i just say calmly &#39;i am female&#39; and thats it. i hate people like that and twitter is full of them &gt;:(
Of course anime profiles with thinking other people are evil.
Pewds haters are so pathetic and stupid.
cancelling people is not ok
i support me and you

your app is so simple its boring but addicting
or just ban youtube for accounts under 13....................
Saw some of Morgz&#39;s old videos! They were so boring. However, some of his videos ARE amazing!
HA im a kid :/
I fucking love when pewds can say whatever he wants to!
Yay im 19 years old
Try check Morgz now
bruh I had YouTube when I was 4
Makes me mad when he still in shit on America
i like how he roast morgz for his content and YET i fucking love it <br><br>thats life man
I miss pewnews
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=230">3:50</a> the dude looks like if Todd Howard and Donald Trump had a baby
what is children&#39;s personal data????
Youtube: changes rules<br>Youtuber: make it family friendly?<br>Youtube: well yes, but also no
Morgz viewers : noooooo<br>Morgz haters: let&#39;s go get roasted morgz haha rekt noob .
I have always wanted to make YouTube vids about how my daily life goes (motocross, fishing, hunting, camping, etc.) if I did that would the fishing be for kids and the hunting be ‚Äúgraphic‚Äù and ‚Äúnot for kids‚Äù? <br>YouTube needs to rethink their system because now from what I understand people with thousands of vids are at risk to be sued even though those vids might have been years ago??
Where‚Äôs the Morgz part of the video? üòÇ
Hi
I miss pewdiepie cursing vids
Feel like youtube is so heavily targetted cuz its crushing cable tv, news, etc
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=611">10:11</a> konekokitten bois
At least morgz is better than you
OMG LOL <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=410">6:50</a>
Ok so...morgz is ugly (jk no bullying)
the person who sufferd the most from this is sml
im so glad he said something about dollightful. ive been watching her for a while and im a 20 year old man. i just think its fucking cool
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=710">11:50</a> - You didn&#39;t say...

<b>COMFIRMED</b> Felix lives in pewdsvill! At the bottom we could see it said ‚Äúpew news‚Äù there are more too this than you might think..... Gamers I think we just discovered a new UNIVERSE PLOTHOLE
To make sure ur vid isn&#39;t made for kids just say f word in first second no problem i learned tht from the beam
14 year old: felix is a transphobe<br>us: did you watch the video?<br>14 year old: n- no but i- i- i heard some other p- people say it so it mus- must be true.
YouTuber makes a video about WWII but animated.<br>YouTube: This is for Kids.
just wondering is cocomelon marked made for kids?
Who was here after Morgz left YT and turned back to his normal self?<br>I need thousands of likes for this.<br>üëá
Im so glad that i grew up with old yt not this abomination of a problem :/
pew news intro looks legit
Powermove: Move YouTube HQ to Canada
He isn‚Äôt cancelled tho-
Morgz is leaving YouTube in 2021
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=610">10:10</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=613">10:13</a> thats konekokitten
Isn&#39;t there literally a Youtube Kids app?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=611">10:11</a> koneko kittens meme
Lol so where cocomelon at now?
Me who&#39;s 12:
see since pewds famous he has people that have his back If I did this I would be cancelled without any subs like xD
Felix, he‚Äôs leaving YouTube
Y E S
Why am I watching this in 2021? Who knows ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Lol now he stopped
When the Commenting is Disabled for videos that is made for kids is kinda annoying
I don&#39;t know if this also happens for PC but on mobile whenever you scroll down to look at the videos that you want to click on next there&#39;s like this little recommended bar at the top of it and you can click like related or from the person that you&#39;re watching currently and for some reason Shane Dawson popped up
god i miss you swearing fr, also you&#39;re so right i&#39;m so scared to speak on twitter cos anime twt cancels someone every two days
ban susan, and change her to pewdiepie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=614">10:14</a> is a good part with keneko kitten
Did anybody else think that when he said coppa at the end he said Popeyes? Also anybody from 2021?
BORGER
Right, at this point, Youtube isn&#39;t even protecting its own creators anymore, which is something they can do without anyone stopping them since they&#39;re a monopoly. <br><b>A new platform with Felix as the CEO needs to be set up so that YT actually has a competitor, watch everyone straight up abandon YT and hop on that instead.</b>
now belle delphine&#39;s channel is gonna be flagged for kids because she has videos with &quot;toys&quot;

I should just quit YouTube now

Then what&#39;s the purpose of  youtube kids app
It‚Äôs always YouTube‚Äôs fault, you don‚Äôt get it PewDiePie <br>It‚Äôs always
Yet YouTube still allows porn to be on here.
By that logic YouTube can sue the parents for ignoring policies

Plot twist: Felix becomes CEO of YouTube
I no 19 i 14 me go ooga booga not job work
Youtube: So we made an app for kids, that wont collect data. But we have a non kids app to make it so adults can enjoy stuff as well.<br>Coppa: It looks like children are using your app, That is clearly YOUR fault. <b>sue</b><br>Youtube: So if I make a machine that see&#39;s if it&#39;s for kids, to punish them that will be fine?<br>Coppa: Yes, but we will sue the content creators as well.<br>Youtube: But it&#39;s not our fault for people letting kids roam freely on the internet<br>Coppa: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I watch dollightful‚Äôs videos for the sculpting and painting, not because it is dolls

Imagine someone makes one cent on YouTube and then gets flaged for kid content

You aren&#39;t allowed to say the word &#39;fun&#39; because it constitutes as childish language.<br><br>I feel like that sums up the situation very well.

His views per video are so low lol
Mr beast: <b>farts</b><br>Morgz: ```WRITE THAT DOWN```
there&#39;s nothing more entertaining than angry pewds

Imagine tweeting Pewds that hes a transphobe when he didn&#39;t mean to call that female a &quot;he&quot;...are you stupid? even I as a kid wouldn&#39;t do that...

How to watch all content when you are not a kid just lie about your age stupid

YouTube is for everyone. People watch what they watch. You can&#39;t get up YouTube channels that seem 18+ but kids watch them. People watch what they want. Click on what they want to.
all i gotta say is go felix. Like the dislikes are from all of morgz accounts.
I‚Äôd be a better new anchor

Pewdiepie the online politist

Americans really need to take responsibility for their own actions üôÑ I&#39;m American and my kid LOVES YouTube but he has the <b>kids</b> app. But theres some messed up stuff that&#39;s &quot;kids&quot; videos on here.

I like how the font for &quot;pew  news&quot; is the same as CNN. and CNN is as fake as new gets, so he is secretly telling us that whatever he is saying is a lie.
it has been a year<br>since we have pew news
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=611">10:11</a> üëÅüëÑüëÅ

Kid: changing age 26 <br>YouTube:
Anamation youtubers they like to swear lime arcadecloud and smashbits
I come from the future Poppy Smoria killed Pewdiepie
I&#39;ve always wondered why PewDiePie was often called a transphobe... <br>Now that I&#39;ve seen this video... <br>I wonder how stupid can people be?<br><br>I mean I know you should be more careful but can someone not even accidentally misgender someone ever in their life without being a transphobe?!
Yep
Click bate yes
So why is this a youtube/youtubers problem and not a parents problem?<br>This is why parenting in the US is total garbage.
Im 13yo but now im 9yo

Mr.Beast: breathes<br>Morgz: uploads video<br> &quot;breathing for 24 hours straight  (gone wrong) <b>called ambulance</b> prank&quot;
The most satisfying &quot;go f yourself&quot; on YouTube, knowing the deal he&#39;s been through.
Anime avatar kids = plane of screaming toddlers

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=657">10:57</a> the moment we became 19 year olds

Imeayodoneveknoalanpeopzokilyo
Pew stop acting like people follow this stuff
Lame... If you want to go higher make it 10 then lol. You can&#39;t jump from 9 to 19 so freaking fast wtf.... Dont be a sheep pew
so you know that ‚Äúnew anime plot‚Äù video? well i went on it recently and couldn‚Äôt make comments bc youtube somehow decided that it was for kids.<br><br>let that shit sink in
Fun fact: the moon is getting closer to earth every year is half an inch

I like the description, it&#39;s simple and epic

The ftc is Fricking bshit
Youtube be like üëÅüëÑüëÅ
What about cocomelonüòÇ
imagine growing up watching youtube kids instead of regular youtube
God sometimes I‚Äôm ashamed to be called an American.
Get rid of cocomelon
<b>watches pew news</b>
In my channel, I have made 2 videos and they&#39;re FPS (First Person Shooter) game, but it is on Roblox. Does this mean that it is &quot;Made for kids&quot; (because of Roblox) or &quot;Not for kids&quot; (because of FPS)? Also if YOU mark the vid as &quot;Made for kids&quot; then you can&#39;t use YT editor (I have no space on PC so I use it) so I have to use &quot;Not for kids&quot; but if YT puts it as &quot;Made for kids&quot; then I&#39;ll get sued, but I don&#39;t have ¬£45,000 in my bank, does this mean that as a 13-year old I&#39;ll be in debt?<br><br>SOMEONE HELP!!!!!
I have been watching youtube as a kid but I didn&#39;t give crap to my privacy and now feel like ididot
Now pewds can atleast say his words...............for money..........
The day we all turned 19 yr old
I‚Äôm gonna say it: <br><b>youtube sure isn‚Äôt what it used to be</b>
Ad: express VPN will stop you from hackers<br>Me: google is my hacker
over the age of 12? dude my lil bro is 8 and he fucking hate morgz he reported every one of his videoüòÇ
I like how the pew news editing crew tried to make morgz mum look funny but made her look basically the same
Your thumbnail artsiest needs a raise
...
lol koneko
Pewdiepie watched Jaiden Animations at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=593">9:53</a> at bottom right
BOGA BOGA BOGA OOOO BOGA OOOO BOGA BOGA OOO
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=1">0:01</a>
So kids watching content on Youtube &quot;KIDS&quot; is unacceptable and punishable, but 13 year olds visiting PornHub and similar sites is completely fine? WHAT THE FUCK?! WOW!
Just joined the 19 year old army today
Morgz doesn&#39;t make videos with friends because he doesn&#39;t have any
Does that mean if Rick and Morty was on YouTube you‚Äôll get demonetized because it was ‚Äúmade for kids‚Äù since it was an animation?<br>That‚Äôs stupid
Who else is watching this while pewds is doing the coco melon thing üíÄüòÇ
Youtube be like: Youre not allowed to make edgy content. Youre not allowed to make family friendly content as well
Youtube is forcing pewds to change... <br><br><br><br><br><br>I dont like that
Hey
with more &quot;edgy&quot; content we wouldn&#39;t have that many snowflakes in the world, right? or am i just being a fuckin moron?
Pewdiepie: i cant see anyone older than 12 watching morgz<br>Me: i cant see anyone older than 7 watching morgz
MY KING KONEKO üëÅüëÑüëÅ<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=610">10:10</a>
I miss pew news
I went from 13 to 19 real fast lol
So satisfying to hear him say &quot;go fuck yourself&quot; to his haters. Wish I had that kinda savagery.
me: <b>*sees COPPA*</b><br>Me, Dream viewer: <b>( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)</b>
This wouldn&#39;t be a problem if parents would monitor the content their kids get into online
YouTube in 2021: so guys you‚Äôre not allowed to post content anymore
It&#39;s PEWDIEPIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I&#39;m in the teen section. I can&#39;t wach vids that are age restricted but I&#39;m old enough for Google to collect my data.
Meanwhile,  some Indian/other  &#39;epic roasters&#39; and streamers using full on swears in another language XD
6.4 mill views in 8 mins. Damn
Please swear again
I understood nothing üòÖ
Ghsnavjsndbvdhakmdvgsajjdbbwkakme
Youtube refuses to manually review anything and it really really really sucks. I think they need to stop being greedy for money and pay people to look at things rather than their stupid algorithms.
Morgz got more dislikes than likes......
You have to be 13 to have an account on YouTube, but you can just use it logged out, which means you can watch videos but you can‚Äôt save, like or comment on them (or you could just lie about your age unless your parents made your google account)
Who is Morgz? I hear him in MrBeast vids but I don&#39;t actually know who he is
Youtube 2005 - 2015: real, amazing quality videos people worked hard on<br>Youtube 2016 - 2020: I BOUGHT THE MOON MUST WATCH OR A SPIDER WILL BE IN YOUR ROOM TONIGHT<br>Real video: hey guys, make sure to buy my merch and subscribe ok bye. Also look we made a tinfoil version of the moon.
My mom: watch the news!<br><br>Me:
This is my favourite thumbnail

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=362">6:02</a> my other fav youtubers!!!! :)
Youtube is Going to be banned by youtube has this changed I do not know.
Does anyone else find their targeted ads really weird and nothing to do with you? Like if they showed me aps for cat toys i would be bankrupt however...I get philomatch...it&#39;s not even my countryyyy

I understand pewds but let‚Äôs be honest. The FTC is not going to take HIM on.
I was here from Konekokitten
Rip
Then how coco melon exists ???
The origin of the the nineteen year olds
What about mrbeast
Ah, Koneko&#39;s tweet.
Wait I wanted you to cancel morgz stupid clickbait
I dont like the new youtube coppa thing
Conclusion: <b>Kids ruin everything.</b> Adopt puppies and kittens instead.
So if someone would post hentai it would be claimed as for kids because its a cartoon?
9years army is illegal
Coco melon sucks
Pewdiepie is right that it‚Äôs never the parents fault u know why beacause they are too scared to be called the worst parents ever <br>all the parents that don‚Äôt understand to use the YouTube kids version app are the worst parents ever beacause the content creators are being harmed cause of this

PewDiePie keep up the good work
I wish
im 24
im ten...
Youtube: you need to be family friendly but also swear and there&#39;s a 90% chance that your video will be demonitised or you will be sued
YouTube Kids is not for under 13&#39;s. Do you really think a 12-year-old is going to watch Cocomelon or Kids Story Time?? I thin the parents should control the videos their children watch. YouTube Kids is not for kids.
psyche
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
konekokitten: OMG OMG OMG PEWDIEPIE APPROVED MY MEME LETS DO A VIDEO!!!!<br><br>pewdiepie reaction: congrats YOU ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL
Youtube is so stupid that YouTube thinks my content is family friendly , but I play 12+ games smh.
So if PewDiePie does a video on mental health and says, ‚Äú if you are struggling, please, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask your parents for help‚Äù, would that be flagged for being for kids and not get recommended as much because he said, ask you parents?
sister comes and punches me<br>also sister:IT WAS HIS FAULT
Pewdiepee is cancelled
PewDiePie is the worst YouTuber ever you should quit YouTube PewDiePie
PewDiePie is the worst YouTuber ever you should quit YouTube PewDiePie

Bye the way I make gacha life stuff on tic tock my name is WOLF Friend
Pewdiepie I dont like Morgan because he copying people

Good on Felix for admitting he was wrong, while also not rolling over for the mob-mentality. I can&#39;t speak for the whole trans community, but I&#39;m pretty sure most people forgive you (for what that&#39;s worth)
I‚Äôm close to 13
is theoddonesout made for kids??
youtube:dont be edgy<br><br>also youtube:dont be family friendly<br><br><br><br><br>YOUTUBE HAS NO MORE VIDS

if youtube thinks animations/cartoons are for kids, hentai be quacking
HE SWORE!!<br><br><br>part of me is happy and the other part is sad
Is YouTube picky?
React on the newest disstrack pls it will be very funny
What if Morgz is pretending to be a bad youtube channel just to help give pewdiepie a content..?
Delete your YouTube channel pudepie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=611">10:11</a> its kenokokittens tweet !!!! kenokokitten is a roblox youtuber
Woah it&#39;s konekokitten
youtube be like: ok well for kids is good cuz we hate bad words and edgy content<br><br><br><br><br>also youtube: ok well if you good and for kids we are gonna take your money becuse we got fined even though yor doing nothing wrong
YouTube is clearly not doing a good job on this. For example, Cocomelon which Happens to be the biggest source for little childrens content on the YouTube website, is almost virtually dominating the platform.
PewDiePie: Your all nineteen year olds!<br>Me: I&#39;m nineteen time to go to college no get ice cream!<br>Also me: Wait I should be responsible and be healthy!<br>Healthy me: I won&#39;t get ice cream I&#39;ll get a McDonald&#39;s McFlurry! <br>Note: Sorry if I spelled something wrong I can&#39;t be a true nineteen year old. üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ

<b>Anyone still watching PewDiePie during quarantine? Just me?</b>
Felix: i don&#39;t want my videos to be claimed as kids videos <br>also Felix: puts a pewdiepie version of cocomelon as his intro
Anyone else going to notice that PewDiePie&#39;s face sometimes acts like a greenscreen on the sides?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=360">6:00</a> we have reached the peak of cringe.
Daayum love u ... and also u uploaded this video on my bday lol
When he said fuck it actually threw me back lmao
Get a bunch of kids to watch t series most edgy video
This was clickbait because it said morgz I cancelled when he didn&#39;t even talk about himü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Just be like Facebook and don&#39;t let a kid under 13 login. Seriously YouTube. It&#39;s so simple. What was the point of making YT kids
Some kids are so clever that they put a random birthdate. That&#39;s what I used to do when I was a kid
PewDiePie stop making videos about morgz
Keneko got mentioned ayyy

I&#39;m all for rights and transgender rights, anyone who knows me knows that. But this is ridiculous. People expect people to know their gender based off looks? When it is so clearly not the case anymore; you can&#39;t do that. If you want to be called a different pronoun, it&#39;s up to you, not the other person. Stop this ridiculous bullshit. I&#39;m as left as they get and even I find this absolutely ridiculous.

Do they realize how long animation takes <br>It takes a day to make 30 seconds of an animation and they are getting there money cut <br>That‚Äôs a lot of effort wasted
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

2007: imagine making money doing youtube<br>2020: imagine making money doing youtube
Ok who actually is over 10 and watches youtube kids it&#39;s legit made for 3 year olds YouTube should make YouTube kids stuff that 10-13 yrs old would like and make  an app called something like YouTube younglings like if u agree
Swearing in a non-family friendly video: UNACCEPTABLE<br><br>Making children‚Äôs content: UNACCEPTABLE
don&#39;t worry coppa is dumb robot chicken is for kids
Morgz is not canceled son and he ain&#39;t gonna be bruh i dont care anyone    can hate me  i aint care morgz forever i ain&#39;t subscribed to this do bur because it is what it is
I can assure you 16 year olds are not watching Jake Paul
I‚Äôm here from Koneko if your not like
Pewdiepie looks and sounds mad in this video
Youtube‚Äôs ads are personalized? Then why am I getting ads for window installation? Checkmate Atheists
Most reliable news source
So what happened with morgz??
Woah koneko kittien wad there
im 13 and my videos get flagged because im young
wow pewdiepie noticed kitten praise him
Pewpie leave morgz alone
Wait (I know I‚Äôm late)... I didn‚Äôt see any of that drama, but it‚Äôs weird that ppl got mad over Pewds saying ‚Äúhe‚Äù instead of ‚Äúshe‚Äù bc if you watch Pewdiepie he literally does it ALL of the time. It‚Äôs innocent. His first language isn‚Äôt English, and usually people will mix those two words up. All of my friends are bilingual, with English as their second language, and they do it on a daily basis... people gotta chill.
how tf is jake paul‚Äôs content made for 8 year olds
He is the best youtuber
Stop making fun of morgz I like him
yass queen
I think the reason why a lot of kids don‚Äôt watch <b>YouTube Kids</b> is because literally almost all the videos are made for people who are 6. Whenever I see my brother watching YouTube Kids, all I see is either Ryan‚Äôs Toy Review or somebody roleplaying with LEGO characters.<br>That‚Äôs just my perspective though.
This, this is where it all began, with coppa
Literaly its not like kids heard cuss words
Poppy smorlya is pewdiepie
I‚Äôm hating the Coppa I‚Äôm 15 and I like to watch gaming and art.
If you unbox toys and you swear on that video what will happen
Okey or yes or something
Now there is no way to get monetized lol
That intro... it sounds like the floor gang anthem...
Thats Right
When ur name is Morgan but u don‚Äôt like morgz  .-.
I used to watch Morgz and i would always think to myself.....Why tf is this guy so loud and annoying?! lol
look at terminal montage&#39;s coppa vid
Are you watching this in quarantine?
‚Äúborga ouh‚Äù sounds like ‚Äúfloor gang ouh‚Äù. This is stage one of the evolution

Good news channel
The YouTube kids app is really for babies no joke it‚Äôs just preschool songs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=800">13:20</a> - ‚Äúthe ability to speak does not make you intelligent‚Äù
How do we protect the kids on YouTube?<br><br>I know, stop giving the adult youtubers a that did nothing wrong money for making creative mature content.
anybody gonna talk that kenko is there?
I‚Äôm pretty sure sis vs bro got the made for kids flag
idc about this i made this acc a few days ago i am nine years old but i set my birthday in 2000 bruh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=610">10:10</a>
Yes YouTube had a policy where they did not allow kids to access YouTube. The geniuses at YouTube, however, fucking shot themselves in the foot by promoting themselves as a platform for kids because, clearly, kids make up a big chunk of the audience and have much more time on their hands to watch all day.  So COPPA waited for some time, gathering evidence, before they decided it was sufficient to sue the platform, bypassing YouTube&#39;s initial arguement. Smh
I stopped making videos because of this
Youtube forgot that they DO have a place for the kids to watch safely<br>and if you do want to be safe on this version of YT is to turn on Incognito and the place for the kids to watch safely is using YT kids so they did not have to do this, so YT needs to say sorry for this reason:<br>Reason: MisunderStood<br>and they did it for no reason, last but not least did YT make YT Kids? or google made it, they litterally misunderstood, and they made that app for no reason, can the kids go and google &quot;Is Incognito safe?&quot; Youtube please read this ok you misunderstood, and if COPPA is seeing this you need to answer this.
ahh the old days pew newsss ahh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=710">11:50</a> WTF

Believe or not, 12 year olds are not 2 year olds.
youtube&#39;s logic: South park is an animation so it&#39;s made for kids, obviously
yes
excuse me I do not think you are a transphobe at all and would never assume the worst so pls don&#39;t target my people
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=610">10:10</a> is konekos tweet if you&#39;re coming for that

Thank god covid-19 stopped YouTube before they made everything even more terrible
It is kinda dumb if you see YouTube kids it is clearly targeted at 4 to 8 year olds not 12 year olds like it is crazy they expect them to watch that
Bojack Horseman clips were labelled for kids.
Don‚Äôt mind me I‚Äôm just looking for morgz fans here.
Well now he&#39;s a floor gang
Freedom of speech is unavailable in YouTube
Poppy Smoria is not floor gang!

Trying to find the Dr Phil vid but can&#39;t.
Worst YouTuber ever
Who else was reminded of the leam neson meme by the ftc guy also it&#39;s a catch 22
All this would&#39;ve been avoided if Google wouldn&#39;t sneak on us with those ads... Seriously? ads based on personal data?<br><br>Just ask me what kinda ads i want, i swear I&#39;ve reported tons of ads as either inappropriate or repetitive, but they always appear again.. Google is a Joke!
I wish morgz was cancelled pewdiepie your a god
I&#39;m 13 and i think gayrgz and Fake Paul are some cringy asses
Best news channel
But why does it matter if children have a YouTube channel they just want a YouTube channel I know you&#39;re so worried about the privacy but it wouldn&#39;t be any different if their mom had an account especially if they posted videos of their kids on their account so they don&#39;t want to be any different
I hate morgs
I&#39;m proud to be 9 years old and I&#39;m watching pewdiepie
Bakit Mo mag translate ito

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdDPuiNwGE&amp;t=815">13:35</a> good one
But... movie theaters put ads before R rated movies? Why is it fine to play a McDonalds ad before a R rated film, but not with a video with one swear word in it?
There isn&#39;t anything wrong with Morgz!
pervert
pervertpervertpervertpervertpervert
the system is shit seeing as videos like stunna 4 Vegas wet and dababy jump audio being for kids
wow kenoko is there lol
i liked how konkeokitten was in here it really made a good point with him he doesnt directly put his content for kids but more big brain kid dude ppl
If you dress femininely, don&#39;t expect people to assume you a male.<br><br>If you have long hair and wore thick makeup, don&#39;t expect us to not assume u r a female
MIRGZ SUCMS
Do u watch konokitten

even then why is this a rule anyway wouldn&#39;t parents help them make an account to youtbue? i mean come on.... they should made this 13 years or older site to begin with....   instead of this ridiculous shit.   Content creators should blame children... no we shouldn&#39;t blame children we should blame the parents of irresponsible behavior...   I mean who cares anyway what they watch... most children play call of duty...  18+ mature game violance... and here we all are content creators (if you play a game with violence where is always a child playing the game...)<br><br>coppa law should sue developers instead of companies...
Idiot do not hater on Morgan Morgz the bested you tuber on YouTuberüò†üòùüòùüòù

I really appreciate you making these kinds of videos explaining how YouTube works.  I have a small asmr  channel that I adore and I would hate for it to be flagged for kids, it&#39;s not inappropriate  and probably is kid friendly, but I don&#39;t want a young like 10 year old audience haha.
I just think everyone are idiots except for PewDiePie and the people who likes his videos, and subscribers.
Oop I&#39;m 9 oopsie

YouTube: puts as many gay people in YouTube rewind as they can<br><br>Also YouTube: demonitizes you if you put the word gay in the title
