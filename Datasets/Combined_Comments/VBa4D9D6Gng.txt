I listened to Stan Getz - Morning of Carnival, in another YT tab while watching this and it was impressive.
My only regret is that his brother lion didnt get a chance to have lunch with the hunter that day
Nice pic
Real or not, I love this.
Im team Lion❤
funny, its still fake, even after all these years on the net, go figure. I&#39;m a hunter, I eat what I kill, I don&#39;t agree with anyone abusing a resource, but making fake bullshit videos like this is just as bad. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fakehunting">#fakehunting</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fakefootage">#fakefootage</a>
This video is 100% fake
FAKE
no way lions know how to make youtube videos
This video may not be fake. They may be called their friend and told them where they were going and after they didn’t returned their friend came and check there and took the camera
lmfao this is funny as shit even tho its fake
Don&#39;t know about you but I admire live lions the way they stand, yarn even run . The lion has much potential and life .suppose I have a big heart. I don&#39;t like seeing a human dead where people are standing taking pic as though they have a prize catch some humans do that. I guess there&#39;s no limit.  What a shame 😢😢😢
This is a real fake video. Hunters don&#39;t talk like this. And that Lion was not hunting them...rubbish
I remember this movie
what a couple  of    boozo&#39;s
Yasoo raadiye vdeogan 😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Somaliyey😂😂😂
Yaso dhigay marka vidiow  yab badna😅
Happy ending
There is this bloom glow effect used in many high end video games around the lion &amp; that there shows the video is fake. Plus where is screams from both the hunters &amp; no blood on the lion? Definitely great editing skills.
I don&#39;t get it... I don&#39;t understand trophy hunting.<br><br>When I hunt, it is for food, but that is it.
I just came to read the comments because these people got what they had coming to them. Being rich sure makes you stupid. Leave the animals alone. Hint for food or don&#39;t hunt at all.
Whether or not it&#39;s real. You&#39;ve got to know your limitations. Like Clint Eastwood said.
Fake....No blood on the lion corpse or wounds or blood from attacking a person on the live lions face...but how it got uploaded someone could of came across the scene..so many questions.
Fue un montaje xD. Igual hay que ser pelotudo para bajar la guardia en un lugar de leones y fuera el caso. Capaz algun cazador se la crea y ahora no quiera cazar por miedo.
Is real!
A film with a satisfying end...😏
Fake AF, lion don&#39;t show any sign of blood.
Looks fake. Too many crappy movements. Also you never see them in front of the lion. Not natural behavior
Real or fake am team lion
that….. was awesome!!!!!<br>Simba was like “yea bitches”
This video has been proven fake! The lion is a stock video<br>Image from Getty images
Lmaooooooo that’s what you get bitch
Fake
Actual clip<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBa4D9D6Gng">https://youtu.be/VBa4D9D6Gng?si=Qswd82O14AKU_LOx</a>
Feels fake asf
How do you know if it&#39;s fake or not
This was fake
Lion first appears at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBa4D9D6Gng&amp;t=47">0:47</a>, the exact halfway point of the video.
I love Thais videos
Hunting should only be for food, not for sport or trophy.
Fake, fake, fake. Nothing about this is real. FYI: trophy hunting saves lions by funding the preservation of habitat. Young lions gang up and kill old lions. The real threat to lions is loss of habitat — grassy savannas with Wildebeest, antelope, etc. Study up.
Good
They dead
Everyone seems to have the wrong idea about trophy hunting. The animal may die but people should be allowed to hunt provided they aren&#39;t doing it illegally. Hunting does a lot for conservation of a species. Controlled hunting means a controlled population. In the 1900&#39;s the white tail deer population was on a serious decline because settlers were killing every deer in sight, until Grancel Fitz came up with the scoring system for big game animals and slowly the population for white tail deer increased because hunters wanted a larger trophy, this ensured that people would only shoot and kill a mature male who has already passed on his genes. Trophy hunting is good for the conservation of a species because it encourages the animal to live a full life and become as big as possible.
Obviously the gun shots made the lion retreat.    If the lion had killed then, he’d have taken a while to feast on them before returning home.
Kudos to the animators for animating the lion&#39;s ballsack so vividly. I&#39;m glad they went to that effort to even give them gravity and physics. So lifelike.
Love the message
Hey jayden tammer😢😢😢😢😢😢
2016 lion charged trophy lion is real
I hope she got shredded
Another Lion🦁: I WILL REVENGE YOU GUYS!!! FOR WHAT YOU KILL MY BROTHER!!!!!
Not real
More Video!
I will never understand .<br> You are so brave join the Marines. <br>You piece of garbage.
Lol mega fake 😂
Haha! That’s what you get!
Its good to know this place in africa is starving corrupt nations issuing license to this westerner white maniacs😂😂😂
Perverted sick, wtf is wrong with these retarded shits, scum, please tell me she got eaten
Bro missed shot that lion
When the hunter becomes the hunted, you deserve this and so so much more. Disgusting monsters. Animals kill to survive you kill for sport &amp; trophies. Make me sick to my stomach 😡
This trophy hunting needs to stop this is awful government&#39;s need to stop this and save what is left of the wildlife these are gods wildlife and they need to be protected from these awful crimes this earth isn&#39;t just for humans humans are destroying everything its so wrong
Insane how uneducated people are when it comes to trophy/big game hunting. Maybe do a little research. These hunters have to pay HEFTY fines to do this. It’s what pays for all the conservation and 24/7 anti poaching security for these animals. And the meat almost always goes to the locals.  Otherwise the locals would just poach off all these animals freely and sell them (they are so poor they don’t give an F about your feelings). And then they’d all be extinct within a year!
I touched myself listening to that facking white beeeesh screaming for her life... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23goodtimes">#GOODTIMES</a>
If they died then how did they upload it? Disliked!
Who knew CGI lions can make great PSA&#39;s.
Fabulous I hope they both died in severe agony.
Lol hilarious
the real reason i want to get in shape and own firearms is to sneak up on unsuspecting hunters
Trophy Hunters and poachers killed 1000s of species  its great to see them finally get what they deserve
Good lesson by the lion. Hunt to eat.
Lets GOOOO! When I heard that gunshot i was like &#39;Oh no... don&#39;t tell me those trophy hunters killed again!&#39; But then the lion walks into view unharmed and i just think: &#39;PHEW!&#39;
That was a fake video. Pay very close attention to spot where lion appears. It just appeared altered
Deer attacks hunter search on youtube
He is just sleeping
Trophy Hunters are another breed of people, for sure. Rather than giving their superfluous money to a struggling mother or family………….they’ll spend thousands to go on a safari. Then kill an animal to spend more money to have the kill taxidermied. Then spend more money to ship it home. Eskimos hunt and kill to eat. They don’t have grocery stores or income
Nice
El video está montado es falso
Fools
This is a pretty sick sport.
El vídeo es falso, por eso le bajan tanto la calidad, el vídeo con mas calidad se nota que el otro leon es falso<br><br>Una productora australiana (&quot;The Woolshed Company&quot;) creó estas imágenes
Fake
This is a Fake Video. These are a bunch of yuppies trying to stop trophy hunting and put fear in people.
Hopefully he killed both humans
drumstick hits.
It felt like the lion shot them with their gun 😂😂😂😂😂
Wish it were real.  Sorry ass killers.
They think that’s cool what they did cowards to me this is what’s happening to our species an it sucks
It&#39;s fake...
Why do I think this is real though?
That’s what they get. That poor lion :(
Bro her scream 😂
The lion forgot his trophies
They deserved what they got. No one should harm another animal so they could have a trophy on their wall..
Insta karma is good.. god is good❤
You can see the lion&#39;s nuts
I&#39;m sending this to the tRUMP boys...
Uploaded by the lion 😁
FAKE!!!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IjL-7P6qA8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IjL-7P6qA8</a>
That&#39;s a stinking cunt that i would kill with pleasure in an inhuman way .  <br>A majestic endangered predator was murdered so these cunts could have fun .
I got the bare necessities and no sympathy
wish it was real. i would think the lion would be munching longer and i didnt see blood. i dunno
Fucking anglos they fuck up everything
This is a fake video
Lion left so clean, and fast at that lol so fake
Ohhhh ne güzel odu
This is so fake. She kills one lion, then runs screaming from the other lion instead of shooting it. Fake dead lion looks like its lit differently than the other lion.
This needs to stop. Hunting is so cruellll
I believe your videos are real you are very brave
I&#39;m a professional visual effects artist and the people arguing with their entire souls that this is real are hilarious.
staged by the lion.. :)
Seems like there was a movie about those lol <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23beast">#BEAST</a>
Fake news lol
What they record this on a game boy color?
Is she alive?
I&#39;m a video editor and I can tell you guys  that this video was edited.  If you look at the dead lion closely, the edges around on the body looks a little blurry which indicates that the lion was rotoscoped and overlayed onto the footage of the &quot;hunters.&quot; When you see the hunters going behind the carcass you can see a gray outline over the lion&#39;s body.  Also look at the fps and quality of the footage, it looks too clean.  It looked like it that there&#39;s some production value that was put into the video, typically real hunters would bring a go pro of some kind not a professional camera that would provide clean footage and film 24 fps.  Lastly look at part when the lion jumps, it looks too artificial. The lion that jumps also has rough edges around the body, which tells me that the lion came from random stock footage and was applied to the hunting footage with the use of rotoscoping.  At the same time the camera shake was fake too. It looked like the editor for this video just applied a wiggle animation with motion blur.  This effect can be done in after effects by writing a simple wiggle script and adding default motion blur from the program.  Most likely this video was made as a promo video to provide awareness of hunting animals.
God could walk in sum of yall  house ,and yall wud say it was edited, gtfoh
Why it look like fake ?
Stupid fekking a-hole, I hope he slaughtered her
Did the lion kill both?or the man got away?
Omg i just love the karma. Thats what these two dumb fools get, now they get to join the beautiful creature they just killed. Dumb asshole i hope they suffered goid before they died.... justice
Hell yea<br>..get her a ss
Yes Lion I hate Hunter would killed baby lion
Live lion Looks fake
If it&#39;s real I hope the lion had fun
The amount of people who think this is real makes me disappointed in humanity. For any of those people, the lion uploaded this, subscribe to him
Who else wanted to see the lion eat the hunters alive?
I wish this would happen to every trophy hunter
Tit for tat... 😂😂
Apart from the bad editing the other giveaways are the bad acting and the terrible script 🤣
These so called hunters that kill these animals for fun should be thrown in jail
There&#39;s a lot you city people and non believers don&#39;t know or understand! The proceeds and meat goes to the local tribes, to help feed them and to help fund the habitats to make sure the animals are around for hundreds and hundreds of years to come! It&#39;s sick that people think hunters are monsters, when hunters spend millions of dollars every year, and that all goes towards things to help the animals, including healthier herds!
I really hate hunters! They&#39;re not real men (or women in this case)
This is fake
You could only pray that people who kill animals for whatever reason get the same in return !
Please tell me they got mauled!
I wish this was real this is what hunters deserve
Well done dear lion
Feel two ways about this (obviously edited yes) but let&#39;s say it wasn&#39;t... on o e hand, my species is human, and I&#39;m rooting for them as I&#39;m not really brainwashed into thinking we&#39;re some sort of virus on the planet.<br>On the other hand, that&#39;s his brother, and justice is served
So did the lion got the girl? 😂 would only be fair. 😢
Great message .  But to director you need to be in Hollywood realistic AF
Lmaoo wow. I didn&#39;t  notice the lion far right. He got there so fast. Say they got my brother!!!!
Can you imagine a whole race of people going to your country to kill all your animals for fun lol
Goood.  Very nice
i literly laughed for 2 minutes straight and this has made my day 200% better and im searching for more hunter getting killed
I hope they were eaten.
ライオンが人を咥えていないので、ちょっと減点だ。
What a rush!  The lion was like. I’ll show you a rush
i wonder what happened to the trophy hunter 🤔
This Man Is He Virus In this world
Lol faker than tofu
Here&#39;s the proof that it&#39;s fake.  <a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/sites/default/files/styles/list_xl/public/medias/factchecking/lions_1.png?itok=ntTjeuN5">https://factcheck.afp.com/sites/default/files/styles/list_xl/public/medias/factchecking/lions_1.png?itok=ntTjeuN5</a>
Good job lion eat the idiots
😂 😂 that what u get
I think its staged
Kids...what&#39;s the first thing we learn about narcissists/sociopaths/psychopaths? They inflict harm/pain/torture and kill animals for fun. <br>Once they tire of animals, they move on to people.<br>So now you know who we&#39;re dealing with!
Fake.
I don&#39;t like people killing lions. I think you should just stay out of the jungle altogether
They died so they didn’t upload a new video
I hate these humans
Oh yes! The lion Really Attacked Guys
those people got what they deserve Karma well served to those hunters.
Hunters: english people
Wish it was genuine.
Why cant all hunters that kill pigs, boars, bears, and other animals get karma
Goody goody gum drop
It&#39;s fake
if i were there i would have shot them both to decapacitate them so that other lions can maul them to death.
If this would be a real video i wish the second lion would get the revenge on this stupid trophy hunters.
Why would you kill simba 🦁though? then when the numbers drop you wanna play God hope the 2nd lion got you both
kill that batch
It&#39;s okay when you&#39;re hunting them but when they&#39;re hunting you it&#39;s a problem. 🤣🤣
Editing
BULLSHIT... dr&#39;d footage... look at her arms in relation to the lion lying down, look at the shading on the lion that attacks them... GREEN SCREEN . MOSTLY well done, but not real
I wish this was real, but it looks staged.
Kill that hooee
This is actually not fake but I love how people continue to think that somebody edit this cartel people can actually kill someone and chop their head off and put it on YouTube and people will still think it&#39;s edit and not real that&#39;s how dumb this world is getting and people are getting
fake news
Are they alive <br>The lion seems okay <br>But what about the man and wife
I hope they get eaten one day
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous had a 2 part episode I believe where the campers met some asshole trophy hunters, luckily they got owned by the Buck TRex. Point is I feel like trophy hunters should piss off.
“Not so big now” little bastard, give the lion a fighting chance instead of hiding behind your rifle. Coward
These scum bags who are hunting lions think there really something! You are a murderer for killing these magnificent animals! A fucking kid could kill a lion with a gun your nothing but killers!!! I wish I could kill you low life&#39;s and pose for a pic you fucking losers!!!! You know who you are and GOD will deal with you!!!! LMFAO
Fake
Man poor lion
Just by the thumbnail it is noticable it was fake.
😡😠😠😡
They killed it like they worked so hard the just shot a lion the can literally do anything
Kkkk
why
Well done lion.
GOOD JOB, Simba!!!!!
Karma&#39;s a bitch. Let the hunter become the hunted!
What a stupid boring life with a lot of money..what to do wgit..just kill, just kill...if they are not in war?
Idiotic woman.
Too bad that was fake 🙁....was hoping they got fucked up. 🤷
Wow humans can be so DISGUSTING. 🤮🤮🤮
Well now the lion attack liberal pussy cat because the lion knows that humans are coward without weapons ! 🦁
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IjL-7P6qA8&amp;t=468">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IjL-7P6qA8&amp;t=468s</a> - Say&#39;s it fake due to tail tip changing shape and due to shadow on the other Lion . I thought it was fake because there wasn&#39;&#39;t any tall grass near them the Lion could be hiding at shown in the video , but still , the idea of selling safety stuff for $ 395. 00 &amp; up is demonic that rob people always trying to make people poor as dirt all the time .
Since I&#39;m not  evil &amp; fear God being why I never laughed when showing the lion walking a way unharm after all the 3 shot&#39;&#39;s even for the unexpected making my laugh at all  because I care about people , what is the more about the video  up date ?. Did they all die or able to call the police  to kill a man eater &amp; why didn&#39;&#39;t they wear ( Spiked neck color &amp; large body police dog training  protecting  bite suit   Jacket that cost $ 395 . plus tax ) that turn&#39;&#39;s dogs into watch dog&#39;s  , &amp; why would people cell them so expensive so people can&#39;&#39;t afford to protect themselves at least a little till back up can shoot the pack of animal&#39;&#39;s that has rabies , or staving , or haver sour tooth or something or territorial  ?.
This is beautiful
First of all I love the fact that the humans got what they deserved from the other lion at the end serves them right and second For the comments on here that are saying things like hunters help animals (wtf no they don’t) or hunters help control the ecosystem are absolutely crazy and makes no sense what’s so ever who the hell do people think they are <br>We the people are the ones thats destroying the ecosystem but nobody wants to talk about that smdh all I have to say is karma is a b*tch and people are going to get theirs if they haven’t already ✌🏽
Yeah Lion please get them and put those trophy arms up their asses..
I hope he ripped them to shreds. Every hutner deserves the same fate.
Did they die?
Did they die
Trophy hunter&#39;s need the death sentence. Ain&#39;t no way they should be able to see the outside world again
Obvious a fake, as the lion would not just walk away, I don&#39;t even think it sniffed the so called dead lion, that looked twice the size of real lion.
are they dead
👏👏👏
f u aholes
Killing for pleasure  , there is just something wrong about that
Comment section full of frothing pussies. Lmao.
кино.
Fake
It feels like fucking justice. I know it’s fake, but I still enjoy it. I hope this fate befalls ANYONE who engages in the same barbaric practice. Poaching endangered animals is one of the scummiest things that a person could do.
it a fake video
You hear like 5 shots and the lion just wailks away like he didnt just commit murder on 2 people
Was anyone else rooting for the lion
I think the lion shot both of them!😬
Fake as shit
Beautiful, only if he got them both
Such a cruel, stupid thing to do, trophy hunting is.  Then they desecrate the body of the poor animal  with those idiotic posing photos.  Barbarians.  Have we truly not progressed past this?<br>Too bad the video is fake but some people will never learn.
100% not fake they just trying to avoiding jail
I hate poachers they deserve death
What a rotten BITCH  for killing that beautiful lion.
Lol you can see the lion was at the back of the background from far away
Fake as hell. Decent work though.
Throphy hunters are psychopath
effin Bbarbaric
Definitely fake but not the worst editing
I hope he got her
So, they feel good and proud after shooting a helpless animal? Hunting for food, that I understand, but for leisure, that&#39;s beyond me. They should make themselves deserving of such trophies. They can wear head to toe battle gear, but with the absence of any weapons, hand to hand battle only. Only sheer strength they have like their poor victims. If they end up victor, then, we will all celebrate. If not, RIP to another a-hole. 🤣😄😁🤪
Serves them right
👍
Stop trophy hunting.
Good. She shouldn&#39;t have been so proud of herself.
I wish ths was real
awesome!!!
My guy lion just walked outta there with SWAG
Fake
🤣Simba karma
It&#39;s only fair
Wish this happend to all of them in real life
Hell ya dont fuck with lions
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBa4D9D6Gng&amp;t=49">0:49</a> watch the hillside on the right you can see the other lion coming slowly 😂
i was siting here saying to myself i hope this lion kiIIs them so bad
i was siting here saying to myself i hope this lion kills them so bad
Fake!!!
It’s fake atleast.
Why are they proud to kill for no reason.
Congratulations to you, hunters
They kill shit to the brink of extinction and then ask you for $1.25 a day to support the recovery of the species
She deserved it ur coming in there home just killing them for fun.
Video is a fake.  Good, but fake.<br><br>That said, I&#39;d sign up to be a trophy hunter hunter.
Good kitty
These devils kill for fun not food. I hope the lion was able to teach her a lesson. I noticed this coward screamed when the lion chased her.
Deserved that shi lmao
如果這是真. 那麼獵殺者. 應該受到報應.
I hope he ate them both alive.
Sob&#39;s
Omg
Law of nature. If your willing to take life be willing to give it.
What is the purpose of killing a animal you have no interest in eating just killing you are just like these punks who kill people
I know it was wrong for them to kill that lion but I really hope that woman&#39;s ok. Like, holy shit.
Good I hate people that kill lions
I love seeing all the brain deads that don’t know how trophy hunting protects populations of endangered species.
How I wish this were real.
I hope no one survived,the lion served them well..
I don’t mind hunting, but not trophy hunting. What I DO NOT LIKE is lions being hunted. Let these kings live. Animals that don’t have many of them selves left need to be left alone.
Hunting non invasive species for thrills  makes 0 sense
I&#39;m gonna pessimist here, it ain&#39;t gonna stop no matter how much we want it to, ppl like this are the whole reason many animal species go extinct
I wish
This is probably a fake, but even at that, it&#39;s utterly stupid to suppose that lions or any other animal are morally superior to humans who hunt them.  Lions and other animals engage in cruel attacks all of the time against humans and against other species -- and I am not talking about quests for food.  All of these animals are capable of cruelty for its own sake.
Low percentage of barbey lion
White people hunt animals for trophies while the rest hunt for food.
It&#39;s fucking edit only can fool the idiots not the smartest one so many fakes thing on internet
The End...
Comment section is sheer urban cringe...
looks unreal
Shame on you killers
Acting was bad
The sad reality is trophy hunting is what keeping these reserves free from poachers
Believed someone was inside the vehicle. Note - that the horn sounded off from the vehicle seemingly as a warning of that lion approaching them
Kudos the the lion. Proud of u bro
Stupid idiots! They are cowards and couldn&#39;t go toe to toe with lion
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣GREAT TO SEE REVENGE LIKE THAT ... BEAUTIFUL
Lowest pieces of shit really. Shooting animals for a “Trophy”.
The hole thing is fake. But cool...
Cap but good editing
Trophy hunting is stupid and disgusting, true. But I’m sorry people, this is a fake, staged video.
As an afrikan im happy to see the trophy hunter ded
Wait lion, you&#39;re forgetting to take a picture next to your trophies.
Fake video
our They dead
Look at all these triggered,  bleeding heart comments over a fake video.<br>Grow up western people.
I hope they both got what was coming
I wish this was real
is that even a real revenge story or is it noting but an edit
those people deserve to get eaten by that lion for killing the other lion
Good.
Are they ok
Hunters (bragging until the lion shows)<br><br><br>Lion: YOU KILLED MY BROTHER,NOW YOU&#39;RE GOING TO KNOW WHAT HE FELT (kills them)<br><br><br>Lion:(as he walks away morning his brother&#39;s death) I made you a promis if you died I&#39;ll protect the pride.....I&#39;m gonna keep that promise (says angrily) I love you brother.
Naaaaw we would of definitely killed 2 lions that day. I have thumbs so I&#39;m automatically dominant over this kitty
I mean I kinda understand the whole process of administration there is in being able to hunt one of these animals which is tagged as too old,sick or whatever and the money going to help the organizations and preventing poochers....but the part I can&#39;t understand is who could look through a scope, see that HUGE fuckin&#39; cute kitty cat and pull the trigger, I do love eating meat,I don&#39;t mind killing to eat so yeah....<br>Guess that the ending is just poetic justice...
You are wrong. This is how that area is able to maintain. They sell tags of old lions that are generally killing their own cubs due to old age and not able to reproduce anymore. Unless you want to replace the income the locals receive then shit your mouth. Yeah I love lions. But you can’t tell a population how to rule over their land and how to use their resources. The ignorance people show in mass is really mind boggling. Little research and common sense goes a long way.
You take down the lion because of your gun. Try to take down the lion without a gun and you&#39;ll see who are stronger. I hope that you eaten by animals . You just fun for nothing but mistake instead of helping animals
Lmao some people here in the comments actually think this is real 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Well done morons 👏 hope ya proud, brainless dumb ignorant human pricks, pitty the other lion didn&#39;t take you both out. No respect for these animals no responsibility for yourselves should be tied up by a wall head fixed eyelids cut off so you can see the bullet coming into your heads, tossers
Can&#39;t believe some retarded dumb fucks still think this is Real
Thats awesome  I love how you can see the lion creeping over the hill all slow in the background ike yummy,, lunch time!!! ..what a  good boy!!!!
This editing isn’t very good I can tell right away this is embarrassing
Plot Twist: The lion took hunter&#39;s gun and shot both of them
I&#39;m shocked by how many people believe this is real...
Aaaaaand he just casually walks away!!💖🦁💖<br><br>Hope the bastards got what they deserve. And hopefully won&#39;t breed more scum like themselves.👍🏻👏🏻.  🐾🌈🇨🇦
Screaming pathetically as you should. This ain’t your kingdom. Gun or not.
MFs w guns always got a false sense of superiority. Strip that, and the mood would shift instantly
I hope he killed them
I really don&#39;t get why rich ppl do this dumb shit like donate to a fucking charity killing an animal just for the sake of killing it is psychotic. Giving serial killer vibes.
That&#39;s freaking awesome hahaha
Wow well done simba,
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Alright you did that, now go back and kill em trophy hunters are just….. words can’t explain it
Fake
MALDITOS, PIECE A SHIT, FUCKEN KILLERS
deserved
Are people so retarded that they believe this video is real?
Honestly if I was at someone&#39;s house and they had a lion trophy I might find a way to not help them when they have a slip and fall accident
Since I don&#39;t want to get kicked off of YouTube I was refrain the best I can from swearing but I wish all of you disgusting examples of so-called human beings long and horrific death and may God keep the likes of you far away from his creatures if there is an afterlife I shall not see you there
So the video is not real just they are trying to scare people away from trophy hunting.
Seems fake.
I hope both of them are shredded to bits! All hunters deserve dearth!
Howdy folks🤣
Seems fake to me. He would of roared before the attack. I call bs. &amp; if this was real that lion would killed them or maybe just 1. They&#39;re not slow.
Somebody should have Pumped some Shells into The both of them.
fuck the hunters
Damn. I wish this was one of the cameras that will turn towards motion. I wanted to watch the bitch die. Fucking cowards. <br><br>I doubt this is real, there was no blood on his mouth or paws. But I wish it were real. Every supposed big game &quot;hunter&quot; should be mauled to death. I could watch this all day. Right up there with the &quot;clever girl&quot; scene from JP.
I hope they were eaten by the lions.
Fake but I wish this happened often.
Funny how its wrong when humans kill lions for fun, but its not wrong when lions kill lower ranking animals on the food chain for fun?
Ya&#39;ll know this is fake, right? lol Even if it was real, eff those Lions. They started it. Thought they were big shots back when all we had was sticks and rocks. They hunted us first. Payback&#39;s a B, ain&#39;t it? Once we&#39;re done exterminating the Lions, the Tigers and Bears are next. Oh my.
These trophy hunters should at very least donate for wildlife preservation
Thank you Karma , made my day!
If we love meat so do animals Human Meat is Ok for Animals as long as it&#39;s done humanly and ethically
I can bet u the second lion is Itachi Uchiha fan
I completely support hunting as long as someone eats it. if you hunt a giant deer and you take the antler and put them on your wall if you leave the dear or don&#39;t eat it or someone doesn&#39;t eat it shame on you but if you eat or someone eats it put as many heads, antlers, fur ECT on your wall all you want but people like this piss me off.
I hate people like this  bastards!!!!!!<br>Poor animals🥺
Puss
Hope it got Both of them.
Did she live?
I really hate these despicable so-called humans.
god how i wish this was real
this chanel is 6 years old
I think this was created <br>Still gives an important message
Dor
I wish this happen to all trophy hunters !! 😠😡😳😳
Damn, I was really expecting more anguished screams of agonizing pain and despair coming from the woman.<br><br>I fucking love that shit. Movies need more screams of victims being brutally tortured to death.
Trophy hunters!<br>Wild animals killers for no reason but stupid pride. They should be jailed.
First and foremost  fuck that lady who killed that majestic lion! I wish that other lion killed her, that lion was not meant to be killed !!! Humans did enough harm SO STOP “trophy” hunting you rats 🐀!!! Shoot wild boar and shit like that, not a LION
lol hope they died
That’s what you get for killing an animal fuck you
Too bad its fake, i mean the humans survived.
The fact you losers don&#39;t realize this is fake makes me question Darwin, lol.
Hope it&#39;s genuine and both humans died painful deaths.
I&#39;M SORRY, ACTUALLY... NO I&#39;M NOT SORRY FOR SAYING THIS... BUT I HOPE THAT LION DID FU©K Y&#39;ALL UP &amp; YOU WEREN&#39;T JUST HIDING IN THE CAR OR SOME SHIT! MAYBE SHOULD&#39;VE THOUGHT A LITTLE MORE BEFORE MAKING THIS YOUR LITTLE &quot;HOBBY&quot; DUMB BIT©H! CRAZY HOW MUCH SHE WAS SCREAMING, LOL! I BET THAT WAS A FU©KING RUSH TOO, MAYBE MORE THAN KILLING THE LION&#39;S BROTHER? FU©K ANY OF YOU DISGUSTING LOW LIVES WHO ARE APART OF THIS SHIT, Y&#39;ALL ARE STRAIGHT MURDERERS! PERIOD! WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THEM, YOU DESERVED WAY WORSE! <br>🚫❌STOP TROPHY HUNTING YOU MURDERING POS&#39;S!!! 🚫❌
Arrrrrrr pricks I  freaking hate them. Well done Mr lion to bad you didnt CATCH one of them. Humans think they&#39;re  top predators Haha nice joke, Without that precious gun you&#39;re nothing.  R.i.p to the one they killed. It should of been them!!!!!
i love how the lion suddenly appears in the background @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBa4D9D6Gng&amp;t=50">0:50</a> just moments before he attacks these Hunters. i love it. it&#39;s hard to explain how much i hated these cowards who were cowardly bullies but hey they got what they were looking for ultimately they paid the ultimate price
Too bad he didnt eat these two sacks of $hit ! Hopefully he at least got a few bites in !
I hope another Lion killed them
dont bother. the nature will revenge on all of us soon.
Fake!!
Good karma
It&#39;s some nice editing for it to be 5 years old
Take my like, Lion. You deserve to revenge your dead  partner against those scums hunters👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻
I pray EVERY white hunter witnesses their children suffer horrible deaths
Hope second lion would have killed you guys for killing lions
I’m glad that other lion went after them. May the trophy hunters be hunted.
I call bullshit.
I really do hope the lion killed her tho
I swear I hate these bastards who kill innocent animals for a trophy I wish we could kill them as a trophy see how they like it
Are they dead? Please say yes
That’s what they get
What an idiot. She thinks she&#39;s cool, but she&#39;s not.  People like this that think its cool to kill innocent animals to satisfy there narcissistic behavior for a stupid trophy are the worst kind of people around.
gaaaaaaa dang
The editing was so unnoticeable
It’s incredible how many people think this is real 😑
Fake ironic how he covers up the view of the lion approach lol 😂
This should be a crime to trophy hunt.....hunting not for food.
It&#39;s healthy to be skeptical of anyone who enjoys killing. A desire to kill is not a normal reaction to seeing any living thing. We need to stop normalizing it as if it&#39;s a good thing. (And I have to wonder who sees her photo and is impressed. I&#39;m horrified. I don&#39;t want to be her friend. Who would? I guess psychopaths of the world unite...)
Not people actually complaining and thinking this is real 😂
I hope this is true.. Good job mr lion.. Love kitty all the world human
Fake video
Must be fake
Hunter sniper is evil
Back
Animal revenge
I hope that those 2 guys. Gonna go hell for hunting lions
It&#39;s totally fake
AWESOME! ALL FUCKING PUSSY TROPHY HUNTERS should meet the same fate! I hope the 2nd Lion KILLED BOTH the CUNT and her Pussy Guide! WELL DONE KING of BEASTS! WELL DONE!
I hope this is real footage

😡 evil humans are an abomination
Animal sad
Animals
Don&#39;t hunter
Hahaha
Cap
Pathetic human scums
good! i hope it was a pain full ending to the hunters!
Fyckoff lion
Funny
Lol
Fake cgi
I&#39;m amazed at how many people think this is real. Any time I feel stupid now I&#39;m just gonna remember this comment section
Instant karma😂
I hope ALL trophy hunters die in a similar fashion 🙏🏾
Was that Mia khalifa?
We are the only ones to cleanse the world of those so called &quot;hunters&quot;. Society was able to do it to the innocent, the natives, the jews, the gays, the blacks, but it&#39;s time for us as society to stand up and punish those who actually deserve it, those safari hunters.
I&#39;m a hunter, nothing wrong with killing a wild animal with a gun or a bow (it&#39;s the best death a wild animal can get), but any animal you kill you better eat and the species better not be endangered. I&#39;m not sure if lions are endangered but I&#39;ll tell you there are more whitetail deer in north America today more than ever, go shoot a deer and eat it, not a lion for nothing.
Hahaha, green screen. Lol. Looks real though.
Fake as
Fake
No Revenge here.<br>Expected 1 human kill.<br>But He came to visit his friends funeral, pays tribute &amp; left calmly.
Lion killed was famous,Ntwamudela mean who greets with fire, well known for his enemity with hyenas and hunting them to kill.
FAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKKKKKKEEEEEEEEEEE
What a crime
Sounded like the 2 idiots managed to drive away.
I think the girl got attacked
A lion takes two steps back not to back down , but to pounce till u back down
Looks fake
What a cont
Fuck these assholes… go simba!
So the lion took the gun and shot both of the people
that lion ( that got shot) was the most majestic one ever! it was healthy with a gorgeous mane. i cant belive people are like that and are proud of it
Fake but funny😂
Yoi! i think he just shit himself mate, might wanna clean ya draws out there ya know? lol
Ya need to release lions aren&#39;t going to be around much longer cos these so called hunter&#39;s don&#39;t care let me hunt u or your family 🤔 grrrr
Bet you feel better now lame let me hunt you grrrrr
The kill for sport is evil so is the kill of revenge but yet revenge so sweet Lions only kill when they&#39;re hungry this line was hungry for revenge you took his family member he took you. Who among us would do the same for their family member?
How’d they get on?
Fake
What a happy ending to such a bag beginning,<br>I only wish more and more wildlife would take full revenge on these SCUMBS of the earth sorry excuse for human beings, but thank God for KARMA  !!!!!
oh look a second trophy
That&#39;s what you get for killing a lion your turn to die for your Consequences
That is how garbage needs to be handle!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBa4D9D6Gng&amp;t=63">1:03</a>
It’s all a fake video
Wish it was real, Would&#39;ve been the most satisfying thing to see in 2022
Funny, if it wasn&#39;t fake.
We all know that the hunter becomes the hunted
I hate the fact that this video is fake
These whites please stop this hunting
Nature gets back
I hope it f**ked that b***h up!
Soooo did they get killed or what
Did y&#39;all know that the bible says that swearing is wrong just asking curiously that&#39;s all
Revenge has never been sweeter🦁.
This looks fake as hell man
yeah BITCHES run !!! fucking kill African Lions with bullets ? fuck ya&#39;ll paled monsters .. you deserve it!
I truly hope that was real and that lion tore them up, assholes.
😂😂😂😂😂
lion looks tame- like it was hand raised to be shot at a canned hunt farm. Trotting along after the lady- like he doesn&#39;t even understand the situation.  God these people are vile. I hope a serial killer gets their  children
That lady deserves it
That lion was trotting…if this was real, that lion would have been blazing across that dirt like a cruise missile with laser focus on Mrs. Blondie😅. But hey, entertaining video.
i lose faith in humanity when i see how many people believe this is real in the comments lol
Is she dead, please tell me the hunter is dead🙏, haven&#39;t heard a good news story for ages
Put em in a Tesla and launch them into space ! Those humanoid pigs don&#39;t deserve living on earth killing the last of animals
Shame on you cowards
最近（昔からですが）よく空から、謎の光が人間と言うだけでもピカッと当てられてる（本日2/21も昼間に謎の飛行物体を数機みて撮影投稿しました。）のを多々、みますが、このような事が何かしらの怒りをかい、私達へ（同じ人間）ライオンの命を弄ぶべきでは無い。との意味も持つのだと納得します。
Although is a fake video we should all get the point. Animals have the right to live in peace as well and not be hunted down like a sport unless is being done for food.
Fake
I believe in the power of mother nature. She never allows  humans to kill her children and live happily .after all even without humans this planet will survive happily . But not without her superior Gene&#39;s.
Team Lion
Why did you kill him if hi didn&#39;t do anything to you?
Hahaha, good. Wish  this happened to all trophy hunters.  Bravo.
im kinda sad that the hunters got away with no scars
This is so fake 🤣
Killed a King
It would be awesome if this was real.
Pity the lion didn&#39;t eat the hunters
Poor animal and that b is proud. I hope she got what she deserved.
Good very well done lion🔥 you put then in there place
GO LIONS
Reminds me of my ex-wife coming home at night
(Girl like: ahhhhhhhhhhhhh !) (lion like: ill kill you two for my friend !!! 🦁)
Fakee
They should have been arrested for poaching
I hope it&#39;s real salute to that lion real king of hunters
Such a fucking cow the guys that organize it you&#39;re fucking worse hopefully your .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,glad that&#39;s ok your a f,,,,,,,
This is fake :)
Staged, but this is a fitting ending to trophy hunters
You should only shoot something for a reason I hate people who trophy hunt I only like people who hunt for food or animals eating livestock
Fake af
Next
Wow you are ignorant! Yeah $35000 for a hunt is why wildlife is abundant in countries like South Africa, dumb ass. Buy a clue, fool. And those species are indigenous to Africa, dip shit!
Exactly wat they get !!
If it was actually real Id like to think this video would tell the story of a bachelor pair of brothers. This idiotic women murders one and the other comes to butcher her in revenge.
It&#39;s hard to explain how much I hate these cowardly bullies who are laughably labelled as trophy hunters, animal cruelty enthusiasts should be what they are known as.
You can’t kill a lion that thing will kill you and this what happens if you hunting so many endangered species in Africa
Anyone can see clearly how cruel people are to nature. This makes me mad . Ewwww to whoever think its okay to HURT INNOCENT PEOPLE OR ANIMALS OR ANYTHING not hurting you.
Love the message in this video but of course it&#39;s all CGI. Look at the stand of trees in the upper left hand corner. The tree in the back is dramatically swaying back and forth but the tree in front is completely still, as is all of the grass and the lion&#39;s mane.<br><br>It also simply looks too flat to be real. And it&#39;s mighty convenient that the man in the video is unnecessarily tinkering with the camera so that the second lion can suddenly appear from behind him, which makes the CGI much easier to accomplish because they don&#39;t have to deal with the perspective of a small lion approaching from far away and getting gradually bigger as it gets to the woman.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBa4D9D6Gng&amp;t=48">0:48</a> another 🦁
😱😱😱😱😱😱😭😭😭😭😭😭😡😡😡😡😡
anybody who even dares to hunt deserves to be thrown in a pit of molten lava
Messing with his brother
Fucking hunters i hope they all die painfully, karma is gonna get them! This is not right, this video even tho is fake is so satisfying!!
Stupid people who like 👍🏻this video
My wish same thing happened with your family  ,  nonsense lady , if you really more stronger than lion then  why you use gun ,
I laughed as the lion walked away with his balls intact 😭
So fucking annoying..
Be VERY fucking lucky the Lion didnt lunge towards her. Just scared them away. That was a very timid Lion. Be glad it didn&#39;t show any signs of aggresion or they both wouldve been meals
I hard to believe this is fake while hearing her blood curling scream.
This is how a lion takes revenge
That people like this may be killed by what they hunt. 🥳
so who got shot XD
The video is very well faked 😎
Lion should killed those mother fucker
Funny how it seems to be a caucasian thing to hunt &amp; kill other species
Please tell me this was fake.
Its real or edited <br>my state if its real. Wow a young or maine size male lion did what he needed to do <br>my state if its edit, really good edit you almost had me there hah!
Damm I thought the Lion got they asses.
Damn it I wanted to see it bite her head off.
This was incredibly satisfying, that’s what all trophies hunters deserve
That’s a great edit
Stupids get, stupids end!
People that don’t hunt just don’t understand it’s not for “pleasure”. Everyone in these comments is so horribly uneducated on big game hunting, specifically in the African safari. If it wasn’t for big game hunters and the money they provide to the area and locals, poachers would’ve killed off elephants, lions, etc a long time ago. Ignorance is bliss i suppose.
Nothing else better to do than fly over to Africa to kill these beautiful animals. What a senseless purpose to take pride in. But karma is a bitch!
Verry nice.....good boy 👍
I ho-pe it rips you apart
Idiots  you deserved it
Ha ha ha ha ha People who hunt for trophies are slightly psychotic childish retards..
Actin all tough until a lion comes to grab those ass
Muthafvckas,
I hate the fact that our grandkids aren’t gonna be able to see some of the most beautiful animals on this planet all bc of poachers. We need change and more respect for our planet and the other species we share it with. If we aren’t eating it then it doesn’t need to be killed. I know the video is fake but seriously.
Idiots
Lion should&#39;ve had those two assholes for lunch
Green screen you fools!
good job buddy i hope its her last hunting
Poor lion
Fake
the video is fake if you see the dead lions face there dirt under it<br>the under lions tail after wacharging and coming back watch closely the tails end
FAKKKKKEEEEEE!
Beautiful ❤️
is fake... &lt;.&lt;
I hope the lion killed those two disgusting excuses of a human being. Karma is a bitch. Lions are &quot;critically endangered&quot; you empty souless fucks
I wish it was real a footage but hopefully one day this will happen
I heard two shots but I don&#39;t see any blood pouring out of the lion, so I&#39;m gonna guess they missed and just scared him off with the gunfire. I have no idea if the lion layed any hurt on the hunters, but the woman did let quite a scream out of her so he may have gotten a bite or a slash in.
Leave the lions alone stop hunting them for trophies poaching is alegle you can get arrested
Yea show them people  manners lion!
That&#39;s the reaction they are looking for. Anger in your comments. That was a fake video.
I hope they are all dead. Luckily its fake corny video
This gets me Enraged to see ppl killing animals with guns! Str8 cowards!! Wouldve been nice if Lion ate them both..
Too bad it&#39;s fake
the &quot;dead lion is obviously fake
Even though this video is fake I really support the message
Are they dead
I&#39;d love to bowhunt a lion some day! Maybe one day
I thing they die
Fake they did good job .
i wonder if they lived or not
That one was goood
She dead dead
Sucks doesn’t it..when you’re the one being hunted 😂🤷🏻‍♀️
Good video but fake
Lion deserves respect like us too so stop joking &amp; messing with them because it&#39;s not funny
It was staged the supposed dead lion not real<br>The guys are actors
Great special effects. Shadow on the lion at the end gives it away.
Sorry guys it’s a fake
Fake
Fake
Doesn’t look genuine but give that lion a years supply of unarmed hunter girls. It could be offered as a profitable spectacle who would not be pleased when the lions teeth chomped into the little shooter tourists neck and ripped out a big chunk👍
Karen running
its fake u can see the lion casually walking up a lion attacking will use all of its power to go for a kill if it wasnt a show lion u would see it sprinting then see it hurdle its body at them but nope just a show lion and some clever editing
I can watch these kind of videos 24/7. Pure pleasure!
Let’s keep trophy hunting because it’s legal and fun to do
That&#39;s how it&#39;s dons king 😤
역겹네. 사자에게 찢기는 장면을 봐야하는데
Oh my God I&#39;m cool I killed something with a gun. Like that&#39;s not heard of.
Trophy hunting is strange and I dont get it. But let&#39;s not confuse big game hunting in general with the former. These hunters come in and take care of animals that need to be culled for the safety of the native villages there. And their money funds the anti-poaching groups that police the area. And the meat, in general, goes to feed these villages.<br><br>Trophy hunting is ridiculous and stupid, but everyone should know that this is a nuanced situation going on in these areas.
Whoever came looking for them people loaded this up and it might have been their friends but payback is a bitch👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Fake
While it&#39;s most definitely fake, it is kind of chilling to see
Wow this looks so real and lions don’t eat humans they’re scared of them if you touch a lion cub you’re done for or if you touch a camel that is dead in the desert explode and you die probably not you got covered with blood and stuff this is nature I bet the lion is just sleeping and this video is very fake is she trying to be cool or something Because the people made this video are very very not cool very ugly for killing a lion that is sleeping I hate this editing so much bad

The lion walking away tho🤣🤣🤣
Wow how a powerful people just hold gun in one hand and shoot on wild animals and now you will be called as most dangerous person and strong person if you have guts then fight with unarmed hands with animals then we will see how much they are stronger than animals
Lame.
Irrefutable proof why many more lions need to be killed off. They are a threat to law abiding, peaceable hunters.
That&#39;s a big KARMA. <br>It&#39;s a good message to those who kill animals for a throphy. Even though it not real but thanks the way you put together.👌 ✌
They deserved that. What jerks hunting endangered animals. They deserve it
that&#39;s not  real
sucked in
that lion sure wants karma for his brutha
I love the fact the lion yes yes yes good lion 🦁
I&#39;m so glad the lion killed them both thats what they get this needs to happen more often to those who do this I think they need to be put in a cage and the lions get a go at them for this
Right to karma
You can see the second lion coming to get their twisted a$$’s in the background!
Good job lion
Super fake
Ok....Hunting for the sole purpose of killing something is not hunting,  it&#39;s merely killing!  I hunt deer, turkey and  small game. I do it for many reasons, mostly for the encounter, and pure meat that hasn&#39;t been tainted with chemicals. For me it&#39;s never just about taking the life of an animal. Instead it&#39;s much more about the experience and excitement of fair chase. Some of my most memorable hunts have been of the ones I didn&#39;t harvest. To anyone that is against hunting (true ethical hunting)  remember this......the next time you buy a three piece chicken meal, or sit down for a sunday roast beef or whatever, you are hiring someone to kill that animal for YOU. The processors, farmers, and butchers have to get paid as well.
Good editing, too bad it&#39;s not real :c
Wtf is wrong with humans…
Excellent!
Surves them right. Hope he got them both. Poor lion.
Oh I do hope they were ripped to pieces and killed
I hope they died
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBa4D9D6Gng&amp;t=48">0:48</a> , here warrior comes .
Sick.
If only this were real. Funny how hunters aren&#39;t so okay with hunting when they&#39;re the prey. Maybe they should consider that before picking up their weapons and unnecessarily killing animals because they&#39;re pathetic, sick in the head, d-bags who want an ego trip.
Editod
i hate this Trophy hunting
Oh daddy
Lol I hope it got them.
Tell the lion killed them both
Why this have to much dislikes
fake
The lion: how do you like it now
Tai,, video nipu blog !
I HATE THAT HUNTER 😡😡😡😡😡
Yes kill that monster some other monsters are disliking the video btw
She needs to go to prison and the idiot with her .
Don’t mess with lions 🦁
Lion wouldn&#39;t casually walk up to a human like that to attack....they would be in a full Burst when attacking
They got what they deserve what’s the point of killing a beautiful animal like that
Wtf these clowns just kill because they are psychopaths no need to kill a lion
These hunters are wretched things i have ever seen,  i will happily shoot these motherfuckers
Did they survive? I hope you can tell me
the best video i ever seen fukers always killing animals for no good reason they got what they was doing hunter becomes the hunted god works in way of wonder
Why can’t they eat the lion? Maybe lion taste as bad as bear
I wish this was real I hate trophy hunters. I like hunters who eat the animals and actually use the skin to make something.
Fucking pathetic shits. Take away their gun and they’re nothing. Ran like cowards. Hell is waiting for them :)
Karma
Fake
i wish this were real. poachers that kill big cats should be mauled to death and i would enjoy watching
Lmao saw this a long time ago, I swore it was real
It&#39;s fake
Fake
I&#39;d love to knock these two clean out in public.
Yeah, kaaaarma jajaja.
Karma 🙏
Yhey don&#39;t deserve this but hunters deserve better hell
Why hunt lion
☠️☠️☠️
That’s what you get for hunting with a woman, if it was a man with the rifle he would have remain calm and took a shot at the lion close range
I hope they are dead
Anyone who dares to kill tigers, lions and other majestic beasts for trophies and for sport, deserve to fall victim themselves. 🙂
Dumb beeeech.  Well, they’re god creatures too.  Too damn bad the lions don’t carry guns as well.
I hope the Lions 🦁 &amp; Hyenas Eat Them 4 Lunch &amp; Dinner 😁
They killed his brother its good to see him fight back
The dead lion just respawned and got its K/D back up
Good editing, bad acting lol
The lion brother: so you have chosen to death
cute CGI lion
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣nice one
Hopefully he got her…
BEAUTIFUL FOOTAGE ,LOVE IT ,SUCH STUPID ACTIVITIE, WOMAN GOT KILLED, FUNNY LION NEVER ROARED, INTELLIGENT CREATURE,ONE MORE UNFORTUNATELY ITS FAKE,LION KILLED ITS SLEEPING THE OTHER LION NEVER RUNS AWAY WITH  SHOOTS

Totally horrible and disgusting 😔😔
Applause for the lion<br>Kneel before the king 👏
I&#39;m pretty sure the running lion is from the old Disney animal kingdom commercial from 1998
Karma .lol
Good ,i hope those arseholes gor ripped to bits ,and DIED ,that would really make my day
Absolute scumbags shooting that beautiful lion for a trophy hunt. Hope the other lion ripped both those scum to bits. Karma.
Real men hunt poachers not innocent animals

Absolute heroes..Devils gonna get you😄
They freaking deserved it
This lion is possible coming to aid on of it&#39;s mates, or maybe as revenge to hunt back.
I hope that Lion has punished those  bas...ed for killing that lion
And now there trophies on the lions wall
Tit for tat 😂😂😂😂🙏🙏🙏
Please don&#39;t kill animals
horrible people
If i kill a big deee im still gonna eat it but mount the head and horns its only getting rid of part of the back strip and senseless hunting is bad
Why can&#39;t people kill this people and be 👌
Honestly she kind of deserved being chased down by a lion there&#39;s like 750 left
Kill all hunters of the world please
No humans were harmed during the making of this video
Lions be like:
Nice editing
Fake video posted by propagandists. If you don&#39;t like hunting that is your right but producing or posting a fake video to promote your agenda demonstrates a complete lack of integrity and diminishes your credibility and by extension your cause. Nevertheless, I have to hand it to you. You suckered 14,000 gullible people into giving you a like and got 18 million views so you pocketed a lot of money if this video was monetized. Activism can be a very profitable activity. Makes me wonder who is really exploiting the animals??? The hunters pay massive fees that support conservation and fund law enforcement to prevent poaching. The meat from the animals goes to the families of the trackers and local people that also helps reduce poaching of young breeding age animals and female animals. I don&#39;t like trophy hunting but the benefits outweigh the costs and it is a major factor in preserving African wildlife and their habitat. Emotionalism and virtue signaling does nothing to preserve habitat and fund anti-poaching efforts.
Well done lion
That lions family would be so happy to eat you 😌 and your family should be happy to watch you being eaten 🤣🤣hope that happens soon🤨😂
If their dialogue wasnt so obviously a paradoy i might by it lol
You idiots killing lion is fun how would you feel if I kill your family huh you thick biscuits
Yes... karma
Its fake...
I wish that lion ate both of them !
So fake
I know it’s fake but I like to think it’s real
You know I&#39;m never really surprised by the damage Hunters end up getting sometimes that puts them out of commission that is very similar to the damage that they have done, anyone who truly understands this and knows how to work with it, is a true magician. So whenever you see someone&#39;s gun malfunction who is a hunter, they had it coming, whenever you see a hunter become hunted by the same animal that they&#39;re hunting or by another animal, that&#39;s karma, they had it coming, and the same kind of karma plays out in real life in the wild... there&#39;s not enough people to challenge or dismiss it... Karma&#39;s real
This is just like the Lion King. They killed Mufassor and then Simba comes back and takes revenge
I hope the hunters are dead
Shame on that hunter
It’s gonna be so sad when these animals go extinct because of hunters
This arenot humans but devils
Why you all amimal haters
they deserve it.
The vid is fake
Irony
Losers
(i know this video is fake) trophy hunting should be banned, period. whoever argues with that statement is just a dumbass.
i suport guns and hunting if you disagree then thats to bad
Karmas a bitch
The lion looks like it was put there in photoshop
I hate trophy hunters, but people who hunt for food aren&#39;t so bad
When you respawn to kill that person shot you
I HOPE THAT LION EAT THEM
Poaching should become a federal crime. that leads to all animals.
What woulda been cool is if the lion woulda  had a pix of him standing over her laughing at his kill… perfect scenario in my book!
I wish this would happen in real life to all hunters for the suffering they cause to animals 😆 that would be hilarious
Fun fact: the lion grab there rifle and shot both of them
I despise people who hunt for the sheer pleasure of killing an animal.
Fuck whoever made this click bait bullshit
Work work work work work <br>~A bear~
This is beautiful lol
Wish the hunters bodies got ripped apart.
I can’t believe trophy hunting is a thing theses humans don’t deserve to live
Fake!
this is fake.
I hope the lion won
Rest in piece
i love this video, good job lion
Fart
I wonder who is the star of this video? The hunters or the lion? More like the lion.
Rip to those people who believed this editing..😂😂
Did they die?
A moment of silence for the people who think this is real
Oops
Hunters hahahahahahaahah he is dead poor cat lions brother  hahaha he is dead but u will die humans poor humans hahaha
i would have liked if it was true, i hate this kind of hunters, just to kill !!!
Good for the Lion. Take every trophy hunter out. Slowly.
Haha lion casually walks away. Some hunter, using a gun, show me one with a knife or spear hunting a lion then u can brag,
Hunters say that murdering beautiful, inocent and defenceless, animals is the best way of wildlife conservation.<br>This famous conservation argument is something the hunting industry invented because more and more people are criticising hunting. Little by little there is a progress in ethics in society. Ethics that includes also nohuman beings.<br>And bloodthirsty hunters are so happy to have this absurd argument. It&#39;s all about profits, people who need strong, sick emotions or rich perverts (specially trophy hunting).<br>They call animal rights organisations and activists ignorent or stupid and that&#39;s just as absurd as the conservation argument.<br>Anti-Hunter don&#39;t make any profit they just love animals and nature in a empathic and compassional way, not with violence and murder like hunters.<br>Scum on earth.
I laughed when the lion walked away unharmed
Taking to much pride in a kill with an overpowered weapon. Natural selection.
I wish this was real.
The bitch is dead?
My god I thought this was real for a second I was scared
Fuckin hunters got what they deserved,  KARMA
Get them lion eat they stupid asses
I love the argument &quot;trophy hunting raises money to provide protection from poachers&quot;. Meanwhile trophy hunters and poachers are both killing these animals. Maybe raise money in a different way. Nature would thrive without humans.  Side note: This video looks fake.
You get what you fukin deserve
Too bad this is fake😒
That wasnt real
R.i.P dumb  and dumb 2 so dumb
I like how the lion came back for revenge
If only it was real. Im with the lions.
Please don&#39;t dislike this video guys<br>The uploader is against trophy hunting
Ciekawe, gdzie mieszka tych 21 tysięcy śmierdzących chujów, którzy dali tu swój kurewski kciuk w dół?
Jestem usatysfakcjonowana absolutnie, nosił wilk razy kilka ponieśli i wilka
Good for them I hate these hunters I hope the lion killed both of them
So disgusting to trophy hunt
Fake as nikki minaj ass.
Clearly FAKE!
Nice shoot but keep stay alert pal
I think those shots were the lion reciprocating payback. Good kitty 😂😂
This played out like a horror movie ending holy shit, the last thing you hear is the screams before the gun shot go off and all is silent as the lion walks away like he finished them off
I hope the lion ate them!!! Disgusting people!!!!
Lion:sees dead lion <br>Also lion:attacks take that
He die ???
Wrong way to go for the right cause mate, but <br>1st. there can Kids stomble upon this video<br>2nd. not everytime when a Lion gets shot, it is for the Trophy <br><br>And to all the people joking, lions actually do take revenge for members of their pride beeing killed, and there is no place for jokes about that. Any carnivore that found out that it can prey on humans will never stop doing so, because our senses have been dulled to an extend where we are just the easiest prey, and the consequents of exactly that were or maybe even are visible in Tansania, and just listening to any report about that will &quot;ruin that joke of you&quot;.<br><br>But never the less, hunting for meat is just predetorial behavior, even if humans do it, and even if you do it for another reason like selfdefense or protecting humans from any harm,there is nothing wrong with it, even if you keep trophies. But hunting just for the trophies or even worse only the kill is just sick, and in my opinion needs to be outlawed.
Good revenge why hunt majestic animals please africa government and world government stop to kill wild lions tigers cheetah leopord puma lynx caracal please stop to kill wild majestic animals
The Lion is the director of this short film,,good job SIMBA!!
I love this so much
I wish The lion just ran full speed and killed tha lady
This is fake
Honestly trophy hunting is the stupidest thing I have ever come across. What is the purpose of killing an animal to hung it. Why not just breed a whole spices and have a big farm of alive animals. I think alive alive animals are not prestigious and represent how much of a hard worker you are than simply being a coward who uses a gun to take down an animal. If anyone thinks trophy hunting is good. Then get ready to put down your weapons and fight the animals if you can. You lazy, good for nothing rich people!!!!!!
I don&#39;t understand why people dislike this just look at the description
Its fake idiots who are disliking
You got what you deserve… king is king… no one can take his place…
It is fake though
That’s what they deserve
The killer of that lion must be punished after snatching independence rights from animals.
Poor lion
Totally on the lions side us humans destroyed this once beautiful planet Ik I am a human myself but we need punishment
Espero que sea cierto que el leon matá a esa pareja de malditos y que lo hiciera muy lentamente.
no one noticed that someone was honking the horn, who honks the horn? , are there more than two people there? , and how can the original video be uploaded? , are the two people safe? , still a mystery.....
Still better than poaching.
Hay dear <br>Next time when you are going to trophy hunt don&#39;t kill the lions and animals<br>Kill your son and daughter it is better then trophy hunting<br>Bloody hunters😭😭😭...
I wish i can feed you to the fucking salt water crocodile
You talk like its hundreds of thousands of animals and it is not. The problem is the poachers because they take more than one.
Sadly this isnt real but I hope that one day a lion will eat these bastards
That shit ain&#39;t real
Wow that is good editing if I am gonna be straight up
They deserve what ever the lion did to them good job lion
Hilarious and fake
Fake ass video
This looks fake
I want to see that lion eating them alive. Bloody show off.
That&#39;s what happens when you give a weapon to a feminist
The lion looks fake
Nice
Damn, 2 trophy lions for the price of one
I&#39;m not mad 😡 Love it he revenge his family member
Peoples are how sellfish they think about themselves but don&#39;t think about other creatures
Fake, <br>Pretty clear that the Lion didn&#39;t come with an attack mindset.
Spoiler alert this video is fake. So all you snowflakes that came in their pants while watching this it is just like your world make believe. I do not believe in Trophy hunting.
aww don&#39;t scream now.I hope that lion tore her ass up. I just don&#39;t respect game hunting, especially with a gun. If you&#39;re do it do the real way with a spear.
I wish this was true
Hunter &quot;get your Guns out&quot;<br> Lion &quot;Where&#39;s your guns now?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBa4D9D6Gng&amp;t=62">1:02</a> Cue the TPIR Losing Horns. LOL!! Oh it sure sucks to be them right now doesn&#39;t it?? The hunters have become the hunted.
Shame on ya us dummies
Man I love hunting
Fake and gay.
Fake
Fake !!!!
Sooo fake
Haha karma! They deserved it
I think this video is Fake.
Fake
If this was real she had plenty of time to turn the rifle point it at the Lions head point blank and pull the trigger and he would have fell dead...it was all fake!!!
Thats wtf yall get who takes the head of animals and pu tit on there walls thats karma bitch if yall died dont matter
That’s what her ass gets
It&#39;s a shame this isn&#39;t real
stop killing animal for fun
karma
Very good, tit for tat.
If only this was real!  Anyone that hunts and kills lions deserves to be mauled by one.
Karma is always watching 🤣
Horrible ppl to kill such an amazing animal learnt there lesson hopefully
Girl turned her head quickly and screamed. It was scripted because women don&#39;t have good peripheral vision.. Especially while wearing sun glasses.
They are cowards
I know its fake, but I&#39;m all for hunting a blacktail deer or a moose etc but hunting animals as rare as lions and giraffe are not ok, its hard enough for them to survive without trophy hunters roaming around
I love the message but these so-called Hunters that kill wild animals should be thrown in prison forever because of them these animals are going extinct
All fake
Scar is mad Mufasa died lol
Good they need to be taught to leave these animals td alone
Only video where dislikes are more than likes
Hey is not fake
Ye lmao how did they uplod it even if its post in to clouds instantly u stipp need thath csker and rescue needed to come in there
bith and now you are deth
Would hope another lion charges shoot a second 1 for free
I would shoot the other one soon as I heard the horn
Itu hewan langka woi
Any videos with lions killing the hunters and eat them?
Man flesh...<br>Looks like meats back on the menu boys!
I hope the Lion got his revenge!
I pray to the Lord Jesus Christ that they were ripped apart screaming for there lives, and that anyone else who thinks of killing as a sport will experience the same. Good day to you all
Are they ok
Are they ok
That&#39;s what they get for hunting lions
I approve of revenge
It not real lion
So fake it&#39;s ridiculous
I think they became lion food if so then he sure did get his revenge
Are they dead?
I&#39;m sorry but I wish it&#39;d killed them
Ha ha dumb people
I hope this was real and every hunter that kills animals for entertainment purposes get struck by lighting 😂😂
deserved
To whome they fired 3 shots?
I really hope he got&#39;em
Don&#39;t scream now bitche5.. lol.  Weren&#39;t you all just taking prideful, cheerful pictures displaying the &quot;muscle pose&quot; while that majestic beautiful animal is breathing no more, because you&#39;re both idiots?  I soooo wish I could&#39;ve seen the rest of the video as you morons were ripped apart and tossed around like bloody rags.. lol. Now that&#39;s entertainment.
Bwahahaha good fo u, ass what u get, I wanted to see the lion maul you...that would have been cool
Exelent💪🦁👊
This looks so dam fake
is this what people say &quot;karma&quot;
They deserve to die

Definitely fake the lion wouldn’t jog to them to attack it would have ran full speed and probably be growling
Fake ass shit
Oh ye they dead
Lion do very good
Yeah thats what happens when you fuck with a fucking lion

This is what happens when people push nature&#39;s beauty too far
There acting gives it away...in the first 10 seconds. FAKE!!
SAY GOODBYE
She deservesit

I hope they died but I doubt it 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡

Lion hunters acting dead

I am NOT pleased.
FAAAAKE
Well deserved . Thank you lion king.
So sorry this is fake :(
Sick of these albinos man. Just fukin sick
Even if this is fake, these people are absolute losers,... Leave the f*<b>***</b> things alone and get a life.
loin went on his op alt and killed them lol
21K  dislikes 😎
Go to hell.
like seriously, fuck trophy hunters
Fake on so many levels.
The info posted by the poster is FALSE: &quot;Every year trophy hunters kill thousands of exotic wild animals in Africa, this combined with poaching poses a serious threat to the survival..&quot;.
This looks so fake.
Wtf what the hell are they doing
i hope they suffer from cancer their whole life what a waste of breath these guys.
That looks fake
RIP for those who think this was real. Lol
Great generic CGI bro
I don&#39;t even understand or comprehend why this is something you would want to take a picture of! Disgusting trash!
I hate fake videos
They deserved to die. I would watch &amp; refuse to help them.
Lion takes revenge on coward
Karma&#39;s a bitch 🦁👑
Good lion!!!!!
It&#39;s fake
Desgusting human beings.
I think the people wishing death on these hunters are disgusting assholes, and we should all be trophy hunting you instead!
Karmas a bitch if u take a life expect u to be taken to
Even though it’s fake it looks so real! At first glance you would think it’s real.
I just don’t understand why people kill these type of Animals for no fucking reason
I wish this f** hunters would have died in revenge attack!
I hope it wasn’t fake! <br>Burn in hell stupid assholes. Hunt a lion with a gun like a pussy!
Hunter thinking humans are at the top of the food chain. That scream is the sudden realization that humans are natural prey to many animals, even when carrying weapons. It wasn&#39;t the gun that protected them, it was the car they fled too that saved their lives..
Hope it be real next time and the lion fukk u both
The good news of this video is fake
Is that the dead lions brother
Like that guy could kill shoot a lion
I want him to get eatin
lion jumps on car <br><br>car be like:stop standing on me
bro where did this lion come from
Trophy Hunter!!!!!....these are poachers
That is what they get
I&#39;m so happy the lion did that troops hunting should not be a thing
so obvious the lions are fake but good work dude
I wish i could see a video of that woman beeing fed to lions alive, disgusting immoral trophy hunters
If I were their relative, I&#39;d fly to those places and have a helicopter safari. In order to get at least ten lions.<br>Of course, these people are also to blame, they were too carefree.
rated s for stupid and fake
Fake but nice...
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA, HOPE IT RID THE WORLD OF THESE TWO TROPHY KILLERS, POOR LION, ITS SICK TO KILL AN INNOCENT LION TO PUT ITS HEAD ON YOUR WALL,POS
Poor lion
