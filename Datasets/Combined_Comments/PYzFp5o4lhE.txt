I have been in a one-sided love for 3 years till now.But only thing I can say Onesided love is that  Loving someone who doesn&#39;t love you back is like trying to hug a cactus.💔
Na kisi le cuush hu na koi setting hai😂 Phir bhi mera favorite song hai😂😂😂❤❤❤
I love you harsh🧿
I loved him..and he loved me back... But i never tell him about my feelings... But we share a lovely relation of friendship.... I still have feelings for him but we are like strangers now and i&#39;m getting marred in a month...
Attendence for 2023 and 2024
A beautifull song
I still listen to this song for you. ❤
This song❤️ + the words of feelings in the comment section is enough to made you cry

Call me weird, but whenever I feel low, I read the comments on such songs. Seeing so many people facing the same situation gives me strength that yes I&#39;m not alone... This too shall pass ❤ 💯
Can&#39;t forgive this movie 🥲 just cried at every emotional scene
I used to hate the song. This is top.
This song is really heart touching song,,,,

Sidharth shukla favourite song 😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😭😭

Recently I&#39;ve learnt the actual pain behind the song after losing someone who&#39;s very precious.
Arijit Singh
Every day why iam here.
Wth the comments so sad?
Didn&#39;t like this Movie much; but this Song is a Priceless Gem. I have been a fan of Arijit&#39;s voice for his 4 lines in Raabta song from &#39;Agent Vinod&#39;. But, he is so Phenomenal in this particular song that I wonder any Singer on this Planet has ever reached this Depth. This song reaches the inner depth of Heart; a place where only your closest loved one could reach.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23incrediblesong">#IncredibleSong</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23beautifullysung">#BeautifullySung</a>

Oh God! These lines are just amazing. I get goosebumps whenever I hear this song because my story is one-sided. <br>Hats-off to  Pritam Chakraborty for composing such a beautiful song. <br>How can I forget Arjit Singh, He added life to this song.
YouTube algorithms didn&#39;t not recommended me this I searched for it!

Break up huwa.... Aur ye gaana sunn raha hu... Kyu Jo saccha pyar karta hai... Dhoka khata hai... Kitni asani se wo hame bhul jati hai... Aur hum hai ki uske sath bitaye har pal ko yaad karte rehte hai.......usse accha koi lagta nahi.. Pyara koi lagta nahi.... But mai janata hu... Kuch Dino me mai usse bhul jaunga... Wo mere life ka ek gujara huwa chapter ban kar reh jayegi

That feeling of loosing someone very close that whatever heights you reach in life there is a void that cannot be filled by anyone else except that person.

Watched this movie for the 18th time today... felt like 1st time ♥️♥️

Happy Quarantinedays  to everyone, whoever is reading my comment, hope u find my comment, I usually don&#39;t share my story but, I want to tell you all that I fell in love with my Bestfriend and day before yesterday she came to know that I love her,  and then I was just , I told her one thing it doesn&#39;t matter &quot; you are with me or not always stay happy in life &quot; she told me I will never leave you. <br>But the truth is, she has a boyfriend and she love him the most. But you know sometimes for friendship you have to sacrifice your love or in Hindi we say,  &quot; kabhi kabhi dosti k aage pyar ka gala ghotna parta h,  hope you all are well stay happy and stay safe. <br>Thanks for reading this 🙂

Hi<br>Auujeu<br>Akkak<br>👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍
I remember the time of my late teens-early 20s when I was with with my ex girlfriend - whom I truly loved for the very first time in my life. The smartest and wittiest girl I have ever met to this day. We were high school sweethearts and there wasn&#39;t a day that I didn&#39;t want to be away from her. How she reserves this child-like behavior when she&#39;s with me and me only. I loved it- I loved her. But as much as you may perceive how pure your love might be - people aren&#39;t. She cheated on me. Maybe deep down she did love me or were we just two people meant to spent a certain time together and only to move to other things - to other people.<br><br><br>I remember the scar she inflicted onto me to this day. We were both young, at the cusp of expanding our horizons and about to experience adult life as we knew it. It was painful but eventually I forgave myself of the pain she put me through and I ultimately forgave her. 6 years later - despite the hurt she put me through, she always comes through my thoughts from time to time and reminds me of the memories that we&#39;ve made together - those were priceless.<br><br><br>This beautiful composition of a song reminds me of the hurt of one-sided love and I hope no one ever goes through it. And if they do, I hope they do not preserve the trauma and hate from it, but rather a life lesson and knowing your self worth. Everyone deserves to be loved :)

Truly evergreen song ... Yeh song kabhi bhi apne life mein nhi bhool skta hu
Not unplugged! Unplugged cannot have electric guitar
Still watching this movie in 2019🙂
Amitabh Bhattacharya and Arijit Singh together created a masterpiece which will remain evergreen ❤️
Thankyou for this
اغنية رائعة.
❤
Should have played when Jorah died on the hands of Dany..
Please upload lag ja gale - Arijit Singh&#39;s version😘
This movie is one of the best creations of karan johar
Arijit this is not done!  It&#39;s illegal!! <br><br>Every time you come up with a song it touches our heart. Sometimes the pure melody even makes us cry. Your songs feel divine and we can&#39;t quench the thirst of hearing your songs over and over. The replay button is about to break now. Now you tell me isn&#39;t this illegal to steal away all the listeners&#39; hearts??
Y so early
Yr jahar khakr mr jao magar arijit ke gaane mat auno quki ye tumhe uss ladki yaad m vi rula denge jisse aap avi tk nhi mile hain😜😜
Mehfil m teri hm na rahe joh gum toh nhi hh😞😞
Each word of this song is deeper than ocean.
Ooh man wat a voice .😘
Thanks for releasing this finally 😍
A song that actually express the sadness loneliness.<br><br>Andhera tera mein ne le lya mera ujla sitara tere nam kya Channa merya😔
Bas kar Arijit ab Kitna rulayega ab hamein😂

Ty
King always King arijit
Listening to this melody makes me feel saudade everytime. This eternal melody reigns on the top of my playlist and will continue to do so.<br>Emotions come out pouring don&#39;t know if Arijit&#39;s voice is the reason or Amitabh&#39;s lyrics or Ranbir&#39;s flawless delivery.  <br>This is the song that I&#39;ll tune into in my last hour on repeat while having glimpses of my life.
the feeling of loving someone n not being loved back or for that matter taken for granted is a feeling that really hurts.. it makes u sad no matter how much u try not to be.
Still 🖤
Kisi Ko Abhi Arijit Singh ki new song par status chahiye to <br><br><br>Aao kabhi Apne Channel par
Haay <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nostalgia">#Nostalgia</a> 😍
اني كثيرة معجبي بهندي😊😊😊
Who came here for Arijit only
Dard he tabhi to kam to nahi he.....
I always get feeling when I will be old I will keep listening Arijit and Amit Trivedi songs till death knocks my door.
Jaha bhi ho khush rehna tum❤
