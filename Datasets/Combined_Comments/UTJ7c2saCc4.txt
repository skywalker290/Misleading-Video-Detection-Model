The flirting is palpable.

Did anyone catch that wink when he said “No of course not” lol
They’re just so cute 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Priyanka and Nick ❤

Finest Couple! I love how much chemistry was there! <br><br>Big Love.

Priyanka is a priss
The NEW Nick Jonas is a two timing player for dating all the prissies except for Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus

THE CHAIR PULL WAS SO SOFT.
I think that&#39;s so cute how she said cuddling with his head on my tummy.. I know how badly they wanted a baby, but I&#39;m glad they were happy with adoption.
&quot;details, babe. details&quot;
Which guy remembers everything you wore on a first date with him?!?! Just WOW 😳
That chair pulling sending me to heaven
You&#39;re cute couple
Nick will be forever known for the chair pull..
Him calling her perfect regardless of her  being able to cook warms my heart and gives me hope. ❤
At the end of the newly wed game, Nick pulled her chair closer.... So sweet❤
Is no one gonna talk abt the way he pulled that chair
Last part was the best❤️<br>Keep celebrating love
Doing STUFF together😂
Priyanka Chopra is a Hypocrite POS. She asks all to help promote her career. Sadly She has never donated a single penny to the people in need.
Is it only me who feels priyanka tries to express her love for nick While nick is mostly indifferent 🤔
Wow both know one another  so well <br>Happy for them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJ7c2saCc4&amp;t=107">1:47</a> he sounds like a wattpad writer
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJ7c2saCc4&amp;t=190">3:10</a> she had many things going on in her mind lmfao🌚😭
That chair pull was smooth AF.
Nick jiju&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

There is something very unlikeable about this woman Priyanka. Nick on the other hand seems like he likes everyone regardless of their religion, gender and race.
Still giggling. Blessed family
It&#39;s just nefaction
That&#39;s not true
Yes but now we have to be relax
She is so cringey
I&#39;m soooooo jealous of her..

India desi girl 💥
Not me coming back to this video because I love them together haha. I kind of want them in a romantic movie together lol
I see how childish she is behaving <br><br>And without him she be like : LaDy

The way he pull the chair at the end. That was so adorable

He a wonderful husband 💝 Priyanka lucky, nice person Nick Jones he really respect and love his wife so much, Indian men usually don&#39;t do that
The way he pulled the chair at last. It&#39;s so adorable.
There so cute
🤢🤢🤢🤢
Amen 💕 Whatever you&#39;re going through it&#39;s not over until God says its over.. You gotta Declare Everything attached to me wins.Don&#39;t give up on God , because He won&#39;t give up on you ..💜💜
The way he pulled the chair towards him 😭omg makes me melt away ❤️
They are so freaking cute
Icky icky icky
Raspberry ugh
❤️
Mash olloh! You are really perfect couple!
Where can I see full interview.. pllss tell me .
I think the age gap is fine because Nick is a full ADULT in his late 20s. If they had this age gap when Nick was around 18, then I’d sound the alarm. <br>But I understand peoples skepticism when big age gaps are involved in relationships.
his accent is more Indian than her accent 😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJ7c2saCc4&amp;t=238">3:58</a>
He’s literally a Virgo
Can you spare some for me.
Bro he&#39;s so adorable 🥺❤️..🖤🖤
It’s impossible to not feel their love…..how he knew that he let her down and holds her hand pull the chair closer.just little things!!like he said “details “
I love Nick Jonas and Pryanka💙
OMG nick
They both look so so so cute together 🤩🤩
rewhatching this 3 years later makes me want to sleep on the highway
Love this video! My boyfriend did the same chair pull thing to me once and I was like bro you just pulled a nick jonas move 😂😂

Watched the whole video again just for that chair pull
Yrr they are sooo cuteeeee I love 😘🥰🥰 both they are best ♥️💗 couple and made for each other 🙂🙂😚😚😚👍👍

It&#39;s July 2022 &amp; I&#39;m still not over this video.
All this fun and joke ends with divorce and they move on ,it totally sucks
that chair pull is everything&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
The ring answer made Priyanka question her marriage
They are just too perfect 😩❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wbnvRQ78Q0">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2wbnvRQ78Q0</a>
They are perfect for each other
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJ7c2saCc4&amp;t=240">4:00</a>
so much chemistry compared to kylie and Travis lolol
She looks like that boy’s mother
When Priyanka said I cannot cook, NICK said neither can I he immediately normalized women not cooking but just one sentence. We need more men like him. If its ok for a man to not cook then it should be ok for a women to not cook
Sooo cute jodi Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas😍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJ7c2saCc4&amp;t=240">4:00</a> 😍😍
The way she looked down when Nick Jonas pull her chain towards him, is the sign of decent indian girl.
She is so sweet like nick
ending of the video &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything.
HE LOVES HER SO MUCH 😍😭😭😭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJ7c2saCc4&amp;t=103">1:43</a><br>Wow I love how he knew every detail of her outfit on her first date!!!<br>I want a man like that
Honestly did not expect this! I love how the rolls are reversed, she is so girly around him while he is so calm collective n mature. it balances out perfectly ❣💫
:53 his smile aww

Oh so cute😍 him pulling her chair🪑
💜<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJ7c2saCc4&amp;t=241">04:01</a>💜.  Priyanka ji💞
I am not priyanka chopra.. ultimate power is not nick jonas...so why should I waste my time to listen to this?
They&#39;re now parents to a little daughter Malti Marie Chopra Jonas ❤️
the chair pull 💗💗💗💗💗where are these guys?
Omg I love them together ❤️
🤩
when he pulls her chain at the end 😍 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJ7c2saCc4&amp;t=242">4:02</a>
i hated priya ka after she was a jerk to a pankistani girl for calling her out for supporting war not only this the girl microphone
❤️
He makes her heart flutter especially when he does unthinking things like pulling her closer. Im so happy for their love
Is I am the only one who search for this video only Jonas pulling the chair
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJ7c2saCc4&amp;t=236">3:56</a> is the best part
Everyone&#39;s loving that chair pulling <br>but I melted when he bet her head and told her well done🥺❤
In front of media:super maturer<br>With nick-little kid🙂
but her english improved sooo much now compare to then 😭🤧👏👏💜💜
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJ7c2saCc4&amp;t=242">4:02</a> 🥹🫰🏻💜💜💜
🤣🤣😁😁😁
Nick looks very humble and decent
I tink Nick Jonas 32 ya 35 ke s<br>Dono same age ke hai
Nick&#39;s life flashes before his eyes when priyanka asks him the question
She’s sooo annoying
came here after seeing kylie and travis&#39; interview
So cute 🥰
Don&#39;t wanna be dramatic but when nick pulls her chair closer it&#39;s cute and romantic but when louis does the exact same thing they&#39;re just friends??? Just asking 🤷🏻‍♀️
He was ready for some “-AND STUFF”
I just came to see the chair pulling who thought it would be at the end 😭😭
Omg
Where&#39;s next part?
He’s so sweet to herrr, and her face when asked what their fave thing to do together was perfect 😭 we all know what she was thinking of
THE CHAIR!!!!!!!!!!!! 📈❤️✨
I come back here often, just for that chair pull at the end.
I revisit this video every few months just for that chair pull ! It’s wholesome
I wish she was 10 years younger
Priyanka is so beautiful<br>Yet she faces so racism when 70% of these western pale women want a glowing tanned skin like her
Nick Jonas is more calm then Priyanka, that&#39;s why she is the one laughing more. I hope they stay together forever.
Omg the chair 😭❤️❤️
both are the best couples nick is so inno and priyan is a type of notorious like a kid both are blend of perfect partner
4:2 was sooo unique &amp; cute , lovely moment 🥰🥰🥰..may Allah bless them..
Nick Jonas&#39;s voice is sooo cute...❤️❤️🥰🥰
How happy she looks with him!!😃😊
How happy she looks with him!!😃😊

Nick is such a virgo😂
Who is the girl here? She is very beautiful and elegant 😍😍😍
Cute couple...Very talented, beautiful, intelligent, sweet, smart Priyanka is amazing...No one as talented n brilliant like Priyanka in whole Bollywood...
Best couples....love u PC ❤
Nick remember everything that Priyanka wore on her first date with him.. That&#39;s so sweet. She is so lucky to get such a loving, caring husband.
God when will I be pulled closer so loving by a good Man? 😍
Well now they have a child so-
love how he gave detailed answers
I didn’t know Priyanka Chopra is such a childish adorable girl in front of her man 😭
Who’s here after they got a baby 👶🥰?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJ7c2saCc4&amp;t=239">3:59</a> When she didn&#39;t know the high five will turn into Nick holding her hand and pulling her chair. Got her blushing see how small her voice is when she says &quot;thankfully it&#39;s done&quot;
Age, Nationality or even Religion is no bar between them. They&#39;re willing to do anything for each other; indeed a bond made in heaven 🥰
Can we get one with Tom Holland and Zendaya pls ?

Priyanka 💝😍
I really liked the way he remembered every single details about Priyanka on their first date.... That was so cute
Is she looking artificial just to me or someone else too
Well we clearly guess whats your favourite activity in alone time
He seemed much mature than her
she looks like his mom
Gosh.. priyanka&#39;s blushing when he pulled her chair.. Don&#39;t know why I am blushing here..🤪😍
Priyanka Chopra be like:<br>In front of media: mature lady<br>In front of Nick: a childish girl
He is a good husband
I enjoyed this<br>There perfect for each other
And why I&#39;m grinning like a psycho on my bed eating some leftover mac_cheese at 03:00am 😭❤️
You both are so cute together be like this every time❤️
This man is proof that usis dumb

Would hve been disaster if Nick pulled the chair but the chair didn&#39;t move a bit🤣🤣🤣<br><br>Jokes apart! I loved this particular video very much. Their love is well displayed.
Honestly I&#39;ve never seen this much chemistry in any other celebrity couple ngl. Most of the celebrity relationships inspire me. To stay single. But this one is just super cute. They actually seem to be in love.
Jamaiji Lakho meh ek

Priyanka&#39;s penmanship tho...
I&#39;m like in love for her 😂

He really admires her. I would too
Am just here so I can here how she pronounces her name
I love Nick jonas
His handwriting is more legible. Easy to understand. I like that
Remembering every single detail what she wore for their first date is SUCH a a virgo thing.
Their love is adorable
It was sweet when he said &quot;neither can I&quot; for the cooking question.
That was so hot like I can’t explain it.
Age difference doesn&#39;t matter if you are in the same stage of life.

why she is behaving like Americans? Her body language doesn&#39;t look like an Indian.. and why she is laughing all the time?
The chair pull at the end 🔚

She seems so sweet and down to earth, I hate that people are picking on her though! They both love each other and care for one another !! ❤️❤️🥺🥺
He tries so hard to be mature in front of her. In interviews he&#39;s always jokey and laid back. He looks like a boy next to her 😂
They are so adorable
They look good here. It&#39;s nice when things aren&#39;t over done.

They managed to make me smile the whole time-
NO ONE EVER GONNA TALK HOW NICK ANSWERED ABOUT WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE ON THEIR FIRST DATE, HE NOTICES EVERY DETAIL 🥺😭
Nick and Priyanka told me single in 1000 different ways.
This video called us single in many ways. Bye.
There&#39;s not something wrong, like if a elder men can marry a young women  then why not elder women marry younger men the only thing  matters is love, respect, and trust towards each other!!
Her handwriting 😍
I just experienced that chair pulling moment! 🥺
They are the best thing that happened to each other 🥰😊😇

Omg there so perfect
He asked her what&#39;s their favourite activity that they do together!<br>I was just laughing at Priyanka&#39;s expression at that!😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
May be clue picked up by the right person for whom this arrangement is done !
Short term memory can hold memories how long and how often you have remind to send messages to long term memory?
Sitting on spectrum type light flashes square but messages not coming ! Violet dark one how you write messages ?
A man knowing every detail on first date .. great
Can we talk about prinyaka&#39;s hand written tho😍
Wow cool
Good taste Nick good taste...
Just fav honestly
Why couldn’t God put a Nick Jonas in everyone’s life ?
That&#39;s a good young man
I have to watch this video or at least one Nick and Pri video so I can fall asleep happy !
LOVE

He likes older women, his crush is Shania Twain

Cute  couple.I wonder if they will last
Lovely pair ❤️😘
Find a man like nick jonas 💘
why do I have a feeling that these 2 have as trap-on belt in the drawer..
Marrying elder women or men with big age gap has become trend for celebrities and they call it love , this is sick .you r setting a bad example for normal people<br>Marrying grandma or grandpa will be common in future
Potek. Sana all!!
It’s weird how women always have the more genuine and heartfelt answer and boys are more technical - I guess it’s just a thing ?
“That falls into the and stuff category” ! Yes it does Nick !
“The Jo Bros” I actually really like that name but I do like “The Jonas Brothers” !
Wow , Nick with all the details !!!! I am pretty good with details too except with school stuff and stuff that have to remember !
Priyanka has the nicest calligraphy! &lt;3
i wish i was invited at their wedding hahahaha
they are so perfect with each other
She should had said “I’m Priyanka Chopra Jonas” !
The thin message delightfully crawl because arithmetic repressingly coil without a wanting cause. entertaining, towering dessert
Odd couple. 100 dollars says it doesn&#39;t last 5 years.
Mother looking wife 😆
They fit so well together, I’ll have a marriage as sweet as Priyanka’s and Nick’s ❤️
THE CHAIR PULL THOUGH LIKE COME ON
Nick : “The ring was cool though too right ?”<br>Priyhanka : “yeah , your love is better” ! So sweet !
Sweetest celebrity couple 💑

How is he so detailed especially the question what did Priyanka wear😲😲
I wonder what made him fall so hard for her
The shallow mailbox strikingly stain because step-daughter connoly search below a wiggly pump. garrulous, cluttered equinox
Блин они мне так нравятся<br>Капец как обожат их
The alert leaf aesthetically brake because cello critically prick next a keen traffic. abaft, exultant sweatshop
Does anyone else love to hear Priyanka curse?🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
I didn’t see a ring in Jonás!
I squealed at the last part of the video 🤣

Nick Jonas cheated right? He has lots of detail in his answers
Priykana chopra overact A lot I didn’t find anything funny And her Laugh was fake overreacting for nothing
Youtube should consider fixing their search engine cos whenever you type prick couple.priyanka and Nick&#39;s videos come up.its really direspectful.
I know lots of comments about them... just want to add “ i can fell their love on camera also 👌👌🥰🥰🥰🥰

anyway you don&#39;t know how to sing more than that you put the computer on your laptop or phone absolutely not at all you don&#39;t know how to sing it shows in front of the audience that you know how to sing
I never knew head on tummy was an activity😂😂
Am I the only one who noticed that she gets shy and almost giddy?
Proud of priyanka
I think Kevin is the cutest member of the family
No he isn’t
This is a forever couple ! ❤
PRIYANKA IS SO BEAUTIFUL 🤤
As a girl who grew up with bollywood, I would have never seen this coming ten years ago
As if I couldn&#39;t love him more, they had to post this. 😁
I really think that Priyanka had made nick learn Hindi... 😂😂😂😂😂
Omagoo turu lob🤭
Social distancing
Priyanka Chopra is the most luckiest woman in the world than the miss world...
Gyz Please live together whole your life never go apart you set an example by your marriage so complete this journey happily ever after so that people always remember this good example always......love you and God bless you both❤❤
As a kid, I never really got his appeal. As an adult, I GET IT NOW 😭😭😭😭
