I don&#39;t know why 2 hot chicks fighting is so awesome. Sorry, not trying to offend anyone, but you know Demi had that in mind when she collaborated with Michelle on this video. I&#39;m not alone, right? Haha. I love it!

I used to have the biggest crush on Demi. I feel bad for her mental health. She’s an amazing singer and actress. I think if she wouldn’t have given up acting because of the mental health she would have been a A list actor easy and obviously she’s a top notch singer.
She needs to be in the movies

‘How do you ignore disrespectful comments and let their creative servants and parents sort out the problem?’
When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💕
This song makes me punch someone who hurt me
C&#39;est ma musique préféré❤❤❤
The song should be called arrogant.
I came here for the ballerina movie looking for the song 😂❤

Taken out the elsing priority it isn&#39;t a concern being unawared.things may bring disastors but it&#39;s revolved hope that bestills chance.meant inclusions are the deficits of joy yet merging beginnings start at where you&#39;ll least expect them .the mere predicaments of life places us with coming devotion. noting how much life presumes your more beworths at competing through exulted changes .it&#39;s the primary development that centers a role unlike most favors .we carry a long burden supposing doubts .but the only concern that really apprehends us is knowledge .

Video is terrible—so corny.
The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Warr Is Only Won With Love” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤️

I love the music vid it&#39;s like a Minnie movie
Spotkanie ze św. Mikołajem, Świąteczna Poczta, warsztaty tworzenia ozdób choinkowych i dekoracji pierniczków, kreatywne zabawy w fabryce elfów, a na koniec koncert świątecznych przebojów. Grudzień w Północnej zapowiada się magicznie!<br><br>W swoim napiętym harmonogramie św. Mikołaj znalazł czas, by zajrzeć do Północnej i wysłuchać życzeń odwiedzających go dzieci. Zasiądzie na swoim majestatycznym tronie w otoczeniu wesołych elfów i spotka się z najmłodszymi. Odwiedzające go dzieci będą mogły opowiedzieć mu o wymarzonych prezentach, a po emocjonującej pogawędce otrzymają dyplomy na potwierdzenie tej wyjątkowej wizyty oraz słodkie upominki. To jedyna szansa w roku, by spotkać wyjątkowego gościa z bieguna Północnego!<br><br>Spotkanie ze św. Mikołajem: 6 grudnia (środa), godz.15.00-19.00<br><br> <br><br>Stanowisko Świątecznej Poczty i warsztaty<br><br>Kto nie zdążył na spotkanie ze św. Mikołajem, niech się nie zniechęca! List napisany na świątecznej papeterii, niesiony magicznym wiatrem, na pewno znajdzie drogę do adresata, który już pewnie szykuje zaprzęg z reniferami. Trochę w tym pomoże nasza Świąteczna Poczta.<br><br>List gotowy, więc można zabrać się za przedświąteczne przygotowania: wspólnie stworzymy ozdoby i udekorujemy pierniczki. Nic tak przecież nie tworzy atmosfery, jak wspólne ozdabianie bombek, które później zawisną na domowej choince. Czy ktoś wspominał o pierniczkach? Tak! Będą i one! Warsztaty z kreatywnego lukrowania pachnących pierniczków pod okiem doświadczonych plastyczek pomogą stworzyć najmłodszym unikalne, świąteczne wzory. Ale za to, czy pierniczki dotrwają niezjedzone do świąt – nie ręczymy. ;)<br><br>Świąteczna Poczta i warsztaty: 6–10 grudnia, śr.- pt. 15.00-19.00, weekend 12.00-19.00<br><br> <br><br>Fabryka elfów<br><br>O tej porze roku fabryka pracuje na najwyższych obrotach, by zapewnić zabawki dla każdego dziecka. Może warto elfom pomóc? Zajrzyjcie do świątecznej fabryki i nauczcie się, jak robić najpiękniejsze ozdoby i wyjątkowe zabawki w zimowym klimacie. Bałwanek, kula śnieżna, nastrojowy lampion, dekoracje choinkowe z recyklingu, a dla wyjątkowych odbiorców – kartki z życzeniami. We wszystkim pomogą zręczne i pomysłowe elfy. W elfiej fabryce nie zabraknie wszelkiego typu potrzebnych materiałów, więc ograniczeniem jest tylko wyobraźnia najmłodszych. Dołączcie do elfów, by jak najlepiej przygotować się do świąt!<br><br>Fabryka elfów: 13–17 grudnia, śr.-pt. 15.00–19.00, weekend  12.00–19.00<br><br> <br><br>Koncert świątecznych przebojów<br><br>Przy pachnących pierniczkach i w otoczeniu nastrojowych ozdób rozbrzmiewać będą najpopularniejsze świąteczne przeboje: All I want for Christmas is You, Snowman, Underneath the Tree, Santa tell me, Rockin&#39; around the Christmas Tree czy Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Słowa tych piosenek zna prawie każdy i na pewno niejednego skłonią do kołysania się w rytm radosnych dźwięków. Koncert w Północnej umili przedświąteczne przygotowania, a przecież do świąt coraz bliżej!<br><br>Koncert świąteczny w Północnej: 17 grudnia, godz. 14.00<br><br> <br><br>Wszystkie wydarzenia odbywają się na parterze – przy choinkowym domku, obok drogerii Super-Pharm<br><br><br>Zapraszamy najmłodszych i tych starszych do udziału w przedświątecznych przygotowaniach z Północną!<br>WIELKA, ŚWIĄTECZNA PARADA<br>Data dodania: 30 listopada 2023<br><br>9 GRUDNIA w godzinach <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwLRQn61oUY&amp;t=720">12:00</a> – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwLRQn61oUY&amp;t=1080">18:00</a><br><br>Tego dnia uliczki naszego centrum handlowego opanują elfy, prezenty, gwiazdy, renifery oraz przebierańcy w strojach inspirowanych świątecznymi tradycjami.<br><br>Będzie też Grinch, ale nikomu nie popsuje zabawy, bo sam św. Mikołaj zadba o radosny nastrój! Będą żonglerzy, mimowie, a nawet pieróg z barszczem!<br><br>Do tego wspaniała muzyka na żywo w wykonaniu orkiestry DrumBastic!<br><br>Poza tym dla wszystkich dzieci stacje malowania buziek oraz poczęstunek watą cukrową!

Demi, I really love this song and music video clip with you and Michelle Rodriguez. It has a great beat, it&#39;s different in a great way, too, and this song has a great message, as well. What&#39;s wrong with being confident? Nothing&#39;s wrong with being confident. And that&#39;s to answer your question when you sang that. You go, girl!

Hi
How are you doing today
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwLRQn61oUY&amp;t=48">0:48</a> Revelation 13:16–18 And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, <b>to be given a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead,</b> ﻿17﻿ and he provides that no one should be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name. ﻿18﻿ Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.
The real fact is for being confident that we could have the power of VEVO there’s nothing wrong to be confident, Ahhhhhhh<br>The Queen has spoken. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23vevo">#VEVO</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23confident">#Confident</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23demilovatovevo">#DemiLovatoVEVO</a>

I love this song 💝💝👸💗
I kinda wish this was a action movie it would be so cool I bet they could have done a lot more action seens
I got the chills when they showed eachother the BS arm stamp.. I feel like it was saying &quot;wake up,  ladies!!&quot;
My name is   DEMI<br>yeah she does and my mum out there
This is the best music video i have ever seen
اَسْتَغْفِرُاللّٰه......
Carol can you make sure demi is at the next heartventure event which is I believe is on 7 of October,  I have just passed my lionesses training which means  I get to play in euros world cup Olympics  I will  only be away for couple of months and hopefully come back with gold medal and the euro pean cup ,. I will away October 13 until November 22 probably because were flying back from Norway which means to get back to England were going to need to make to extra catch plane from Norway to Germany from Germany catch a plane to England  were leaving Norway on the 18 of October but stop overs could   it could another 5 days before I land
Carol maybe I&#39;m moving a bit to fast for demi likening but in view that penny has now broken off our marriage that we were supposed to have next year ,. I would like to offer demi my hand in marriage, as being her husband I give some time think it over she dosent have to make her dission right now just let know what answer is thank you ,.
My favorite thing about this is the accuracy of Michelle Rodriguez constantly winning the fights cause we all know there’s no way Demi could take her no matter how awesome she is🤣😂

If this happened to me. (Being in a maximum security prison and used to capture someone) that flashlight ain&#39;t doing anything to wake me up
I feel like this is the song I mostly relate to cause I was trying to get the other girl caught by joining them and then she fought me and at the end we looked at eachother&#39;s wrist to see the same birth mark and we fought the guys who let us fight at the first place and we bacame friends at the end 😅 after that incident this song is made it was like in 2014 at November 25
Looks like something outta a fast and furious movie
Hey is that letti from fast and furious
Totally kickass. Two powerful hotties taking over corrupt men? Absolutely

The part where it’s like I run this show is like😳😶‍🌫️
Just bc they say that doesn’t mean that u r not strong humiliate those mem
This makes me feel like girls can do anything because boys bully girls because they think their stronger no your not
Looks like a film by Robert Rodriguez 🔥
I love this song
🎉
This song makes me feel like I&#39;m a strong independent woman and I love
THIS SONG IS SO AGGRESSIVE PLEASE DON&#39;T LISTEN TO IT 🙅
🎉
Me encanta 😍😍😍😊
Not gonna lie when I first saw this music video I thought the girl was Selena Gomez
My Ring Entrance song for my next fight🥊
I&#39;m a fan❤
J’adore ❤
yasss slay
WOW! I LOVE THIS SONG AND I LOVE YOU MY BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY DEMI LOVATO!❤🔥 I WANT TO BE SINGER AND I WANT TO MEET YOU!💖🌈
This is definitely Katniss’ song !!
Lawd what&#39;s happening

The Book of Eli, Eli knows tomorrow is going to be hard day exploring Fallout 76 bridges. He makes some dinner, listens for a music but wakes up with the discharged Ipod. Avoiding trouble that is not yours is your survivability - most times you aren&#39;t strong 1 vs 10 as monster hunter. He comes to a town to find somebody who can charge it for him, barters and makes a deal to wait two hours. Waiting in the bar ends up with a bar fight, but avoiding trouble gives him a chance to meet Solara, who will be serving him his water and filling his flask.
Is it just me or does this look and sound like a trailer for a movie? I would totally watch it...
Ok im a little suprised no doubt but i would express whoa time out because i did mention how peculiar all else first loves at least met up spoke but i as of now guess that she is giving me common courtesy of letting me know hey MB. What does make you really believe that I dont want to speak with you especially knowing who you are how much you have matured??? I don&#39;t know what more i can say until if this my first love trust believe i have nothing but the best interests of us both in my heart.❤
Eu queria um filme delas,amo Michelle Rodrigues tambem❤
400 MILLION
Am I the only one who thinks go Letty from fast and furious
I want old demi back 😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤
😅😅😅😅 LOL
&quot;Story interpreting Lack of Thirstfulness.&quot;
I literally watch this and heart attack. I love this girl!
Nothing wrong with being confident
It so nice
I love this song
This song makes me feel confident
With Michelle Rodriguez I thought it was a fast and furious music video 🤭🤭🤭
AAA LET DO VELOZES FURIOSOS A MELHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR MUDOUUU NADA &lt;3
❤❤❤
It&#39;s the lady from the fast and furious movies😮
Ella es Lety de rápidos y furioso 😮
She must be the coolest girl in the world but... no man in sight😄
❤️❤️❤️
How many years pass, but I will never forget this song ❤❤❤
I just realized...maybe just maybe....<br><br>Thank you demi, <br>I appreciate and value your time.
I&#39;m pretty confident that anytime Michelle Rodriguez shows up in your video, someone is going to get an ass whoopin&#39;.
Vão se passar anos e essa vai ser minha fav da demi
the rage of demi lovato was no match for the awesomeness that it Michelle Rodriguez
The first time I ever heard of this music is from Happy Death Day
Music hit another level...
Vsfd, isso sim é um hino
Mt bom...🌧🌧💚
Everybody listening??☔❄💙💙😎😎
This deserved a billion views
I know, Demi Lovato is a great singer, but for this song she would have to be stronger (song is not for her): She&#39;s drowning!
Point in no return yea right
&quot;So you say I&#39;m complicated<br>That I must be out my mind<br>But you&#39;ve had me underrated&quot; ❤😎🥊💪
Go girl. 2023...
💞💞💞
Oh I knew this song because of the movie balerina
ugh michelle and demi are both so hot in this, baby gay me agreed to that certainly even 8 years ago
This should have been a full movie
❤❤❤
I love this song so much I listen to it every day every evening and day I love it so much 😊❤
agosto de 2023???
I watch this video alot- for no other reason than watching MRod looking bored while her crew tries to defeat Demi
What’s wrong with being cofedenttt
Bro I love Demi lavato but my parents don’t
Cool they added a character from fast and furious
The song makes me feel strong and fearce
this is my enemies to lovers queer action movie
DESSERVE TOP 10 ON BILLBOARD HOT 100
I’m telling u, this is the shit guys listen to when the homies aren’t around.
Why Demi didn&#39;t make anymore movies.... she clearly can be an action star too.... i love her.
Having miss loreta in this was a power move demi
From The Movie 🍿 Leap
Those 95k dislikes most from people who are insecure about confident people.
Happy birthday to you Demi Lovato 31 years ago 1992-2023
Joyeux anniversaire à toi Demi Lovato 31 ans 1992-2023
This song reminds me of Poppy Balfour/ Da&#39; Neer
Pasados 7 años.. 2023 ok? este rolon sigue siendo de los tops mas b3a2hs🔥🔥
Hey demi, it&#39;s very unlikely your gonna see this but my dance club is using this song for our dance routine, it&#39;s helped so many kids feel more confident and strong. Thank you
Michelle Rodriguez... OMG... She&#39;s so fucken hot!!! Girl crush big time...
Bro I remember when I was like 7 or 8 I used to “fight” to this song and force my dad to watch me 😭😭😭
My favorite action star Michelle Rodriguez😘😘
this shoulda been a movie
Similar energy to Can&#39;t Be Tamed
Isso nem é música. É HINO
Almost at the end at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwLRQn61oUY&amp;t=146">2:26</a> did I see what I think I saw the Wednesday actor I am a big fan of her and you too
The Rock Version of this song is OUT NOW!!
Me after listening this song: Feeling🫥badass like a diva
When I went to Philly 4th of July to see her perform best time of my life
Confident rock is the first rock version that has made me love it more than the original, the rock version of it is just great
Strong Gorgeous Independent Women 💪
Is this an actual movie? I need it
Who is here after demi released the rock version of this song? 😊.
🎉 🌴 🌴
I love this song it makes me feel CONFIDENT (which I&#39;m not😅)!!!!❤❤❤
Michelle Rodriguez is my baby
🤟👁️🤟😈❤️😈🤟🤟
Ballerina ❤
Da uma alma
ISSO AQUI NÃO TEM ERROS, DEFEITOS, NADAAAAAAA!
Ya mom
Esse clipe sempre me arrepiou
I’m Confident in myself
So basta fica um se uma bresa colaca demilavato

Mm👞👞
For the year of the king, the same is given to him
Kept for a special occasion
I love  this song  it gives  me confidence
Ummmm ok?
Demi Lovato or not... Picking a fight with Michelle Rodriguez is a bad Idea.
I don&#39;t get how the convict theme of the video goes with the song. Clearly, these two women have a lot of problems, especially of the legal variety, but confidence is not one of them.

My parents  would be watching  this a million  times of only this song was a movie called confiden
I remember exactly where I was when this dropped
Joli clip pas pluS🟥🟥⬜
I am here for Frank Lapidus lmao
I was obsessed with this song when I was little but It was just because I’m bi, this should’ve been a sign from the first time I saw it
Sorry for the long wat girl
No this is out cantest you cant arrest her for the video she star actress  vocalist singing
Do you got proph in forensic files
And I, like you, the same given to you no less than more
Whose time is yours or mine, how do you love me? The truth and the orphan were hidden by you and our true God
And I&#39;ll tell the truth and I&#39;m going for our father to die first remember you that mno hahhh
I hate games I&#39;m going with the truth yours and my message on hahh your you know
Your dead and God has kept for you an equal opponent for you I am made learned by two masters
And you are not a confidant, believe me, because I am learned from two sources
For some reason when I think of this song I think of the lyrics saying 🎶 so you say I’m constipated!🎶
❤❤❤❤
😊
Demi your music is the best,<br>My favorite singers are you Ava max and Billie Eillish .<br>I hope ur not rivals
Never saw this video.  I like.
the song isnt that great, but this music video is such an awesome storyline compared to what usually happens in these! if this was a movie id go see it, the entire thing has such natasha romanoff vibes.<br><br>a) i take the part about the song not being good back<br>b) she literally uses nats move oh my GOD
Love it...😍😍😍💘💚💛💜💙👍😊🍭
Demi basically summarised a movie in a three min vid
Es talentosisima digan lo que digan de ella siempre la admirare...😍💙💜💚💘💛👍
Eu amo essa música ❤,toda vez que escuto lembro do filme da bailarina
1 John 4:16- God is Love and whoever Lives in Love Lives in God and God in them.
They didn’t show her taking the bus guards gun because they knew she’d be dead better she got the gun lol

If girls will girls can
You&#39;re came back from the philly concert aren&#39;t you?-
I feel very sigma when i listen to this
Perfect for when you get stuck in a time loop
在这个视频中，为什么这个视频有几个人总是在打架在一起？总是打了一个接着一个人。
这个视频看起来像有点很可怕的
在这个视频中，为什么这个歌手在这个女人的手臂上有一个有点红色的印记？
在这个视频中，为什么这个视频有几个女人在一起打架总是打了一个接着一个女人
在这个视频的，其中几部分有这个女人总是在有点摔倒了
在这个视频的，其中一部分有这个女人用一支笔再签单一个字，然后立即扔了一支笔在桌子上
几个女人在打架在一起在这个视频中看起来像有点很可怕的，很奇怪的
在这个视频中，其中一个人打印了一个印记，在这个歌手在这个女人的手臂上看起来像有点红色的
bu şarkıyı küçükken hep dinlerdim🥹
MARKO ZAROR IS IN THIS VIDEO 😂😂😂😂 @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwLRQn61oUY&amp;t=95">1:35</a>
Michelle Rodriguez is such a badass
I JUST LOVE THE CLIP AND THE SONG! DEMI YOU ARE PERFECT
FREE WITH CONFIDENCE BECAUSE I AM COOL FOR THE SUMMER!!! 😩🌹<br><br>(11-11)

🎉
This song makes me feel like a strong and independent woman but im a non-prouns
I still love this song
There&#39;s a company that makes the most high quality one off bikes in carbon fiber rod look and I think they should make the most high quality GTC-900. It&#39;s like ten times thicker three times lighter frame to vibrate made by bot.
Mi parte fav es:: q:09
DEMI I REALLY WANT TO GO BACKWARDS AND REVERSE THAN FORWARDS BECAUSE I PREFER THE OLD DAYS BETTER THAN THE NEW DAYS BECAUSE THE WAS NO CORONAVIRUS IN THE OLD DAYS BUT CORONAVIRUS HERE IN THE NEW DAYS AND I DON&#39;T LIKE THE CORONAVIRUS I HATE THE CORONAVIRUS BECAUSE CORONAVIRUS IS THE WORST NOBODY LIKES THE CORONAVIRUS THEY HATE THE CORONAVIRUS BECAUSE CORONAVIRUS IS THE WORST AND YOU KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE OLD DAYS BETTER THAN THE NEW DAYS AND SOME OF THEM LIKE THE NEW DAYS BETTER THAN THE OLD DAYS AND IT&#39;S TRUE BECAUSE EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT AND THE OLD DAYS ARE FUN FOR ME BUT HERE IN THE NEW DAYS ARE BORING FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS AND I DON&#39;T LIKE IT AT ALL I HATE IT.
I&#39;m both my dad&#39;s and mom&#39;s daughter
I&#39;m naturally feminine but I also like to let out my tomboy side
hi beautiful 👀▼
Demi should Def play in a fast and furious movie

Maine - Confident (Official Video)
Get up!!! ❤🔥
No don&#39;t take the path of not making another one of these. It&#39;s utterly what you&#39;re supposed to do for success.
She really goooood actress ❤❤❤
It’s funny how the girl she’s beefing with is hotter than her 💀
Ya 500 millones de reproducciones en Spotify, ahora a llevarla a los 500 aquí en YouTube
Recuerdo que andabamos viendo telehit junto a mi hermanito chiquito y pasaron esta canción y le gustó mucho por el video porque no sabia que nosotras las mujeres podíamos pelear o ser así de fuertes (por así decirlo) xd
Hermosas empoderadas Demi y Michelle Rodríguez las amó de verdad!! Admiro sus talentos
playing this for marching band and it makes me feel confident
She proved that girls and woman ♀️ can fight ❤❤🎉
Thank you Demi for this song and for sharing your talents and so many of your songs! Life can be tough, but we can be tougher through choosing to love ourselves and others. Sending love your way
This song is the best

She is wonderful and pretty as well.
Ey Demi Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
demi sounds like katy perry, who sounds like demi.
The top listing.  🎉 Demi what is my birth momma&#39;s name?    I can&#39;t find  her stage name clear.  😢.  Was she okay in this film?
Demi, this is one of the great and moving modern day songs to me in a very different way! You and Michelle Rodriguez were great together in this video, too!

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Learning To Love Myself” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💕
I remember I used to ship the two girls when I was a kid 😭

Best song ever!
me encanta esta cancion por que tiene a la novia de dominic de rapidos y furiosos
To get confident is a trade about hard working and understanding to his self if someone let you feel  Break down. You need to start to ask yourself did I deserve it what other people handle on me; no I‘ m strong I do that what you can‘t goal. Fighting on continue forward.
Great song to play in honor of Women&#39;s History Month!!
❤
Demi X Camila?
This song makes me proud to be a woman
You are a fighter and I admire you very very much!!!
