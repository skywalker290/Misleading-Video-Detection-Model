it worked for me thx
Genius
Need a headphone jack<br><br>Just drill a 3.5mm hole 😂
Don&#39;t we all want to do that against the apple and Samsung overlords
Dont forget to add Iair and Ienvironment to help in the functionality of the Iphone,<br> as we know, the currrent would travel through the same medium, and it supports only products made from apple, so that might be the step you guys might have forgotten to do, and dont forget to blow the iphone with Iair using the Iblower to clean it more and remove excess debris<br>I&#39;m happy to help, thank me later
only works with the new iDrill, only on the new iPhone 15 Pro Max
i love how it fits perfectly
Top 10 ways to break iPhone 7 but great destruction
Omg, it’s actually worked! This guy is legit! I highly appreciate it!
Now people think my iphone 7 is fake😅
to jest fake, sam rozwaliłem w ten sposób mój telefon
I tired this on my apple 15 promax it works perfectly thanks 💜💜
I tried this and it worked
I’m sad that anyone would actually try this in hopes of it working 😂
if they remove the headphone jack on a ipad i&#39;ll riot
Can’t really tell if he serious or joking 😂
The fact that people tried it makes me lose faith in humanity
As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there is no officially recognized &quot;secret hack&quot; to add a headphone jack to the iPhone 7 or any other iPhone model that lacks a built-in headphone jack. The iPhone 7 was one of the first iPhone models to remove the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack, and Apple has since relied on the Lightning port and wireless technologies for audio connectivity.<br><br>There have been some third-party adapters and accessories that claim to provide a headphone jack through the Lightning port, but these solutions might not always work reliably and could potentially cause compatibility or performance issues. Additionally, any modifications to the hardware or software of your iPhone could void your warranty and potentially lead to further problems.<br><br>If you wish to use wired headphones with an iPhone that lacks a built-in headphone jack, your best options are to use Apple&#39;s Lightning to 3.5mm adapter (which Apple provides) or to consider wireless headphones or earbuds.<br><br>Please be cautious of any unofficial solutions or hacks that could potentially harm your device or violate its warranty. Always make sure to use official and reputable accessories to ensure the best and safest user experience.
Wrong
I poured concrete into my iphone 6 headphone jack and i now got an iphone 7, thank you so much tech rat
I can&#39;t believe people thought this would work.
😂😂
Fake!!!! it’s still plays from the device not the headphones. Don’t waste your time people. Report this guy and get this video down
Apple left the game
It actually worked wtf
Awesome 😎
A little trolling
this video is so legendary
Did it work?
It&#39;s funny because you can still hear the music after he plugs it in.
Did you really think I would fall for this trick, uh no, and did you not hear the music still coming out of the speakers whenever you said and you enjoy the music, but nice try because I’m not stupid enough to believe that drilling a hole would actually create a headphone jack
Maybe this is supposed to be an April fools prank or something
people believed this even when the audio was coming from the phone speakers 💀
U broekd ur phone
Be careful because I’m pretty sure that’s where the battery is.
He’s definitely correct. I drilled a hole and it worked! You should try it too!
Ummm… the purpose was to listen to the music THROUGH THE EARPHONES, not through the speakers!<br><br>What a joke!
Bro the moment I saw this I though it was a joke or a meme but I realized he was dead serious ._.
Hi. Thanks for the video. It was very helpful.  I wonder why they hid it?
When I was younger, for some reason, I thought this was real
fake
Nett hier aber waren sie schon mal in Baden-Württemberg
I think this Guy underestimated how truly gullible Apple users are....<br><br>(Forreal though, did he ever admit this was for giggles?)
Wait if this is real how come we can hear the music 🤔
I think the phone is broken like the notch cut on the iPhone X
If u want a headphone jack,just get an ipod lol
😂
Secret 2023
shit like this is why I have no faith in humanity.
I still think about this video
Idiot
hey sorry for the inconvenience but i just tried this on my iphone x but the music won’t play through the headphones and it sounds a bit muffled. Did i do something wrong? Please respond
🤣
I HOPE A KID THAT WATCHED THIS HAS NOT A BROKEN PHONE LOL
😂😂
In this video how to get the headphone jack on the iPhone 7.
iPhone craniotomy
Bruh I tried doing this with my new iPhone 13 and it didn’t even work 😢I guess I’ll tell my dad to get me an iPhone 14, maybe it’ll work this time 😂
hey just wondering why my phone isnt turning on after doing this as it works in video did i do something rong?
And also TechRax, MY IPHONE 7 DOESNT WORK ANYMORE, good news is I have IPhone XS
I got iPhone X, but my Old phone is iPhone 7 so TechRax, i tried to Make one and it was too strange!!! :/

Stupid fake trying to ruin phone don’t even try it TRUST NO ONE
Did this on my iPhone 13 Pro, worked beautifully, so glad this video is still around. You should definitely do this on your new iPhone 14, it WILL WORK and it won&#39;t be bad for your device at all!
very simple and easy! My phone is separated from the screen but still sound good !

If so what do I do to fix I have considering shooting it with a 9mm pistol to heat up the battery to turn it on or should I drill a deeper hole please let me know edit: turns out all I had to do is drill a deeper hole thanks for the tip the sound works perfectly also I tried it with an iphone 13 pro and a samsung galaxy s21 ultra and the sound is even better I highly suggest doing this with your new iPhone 13/pro because earpods are now $250

Right now, if you wanna plug in some wired headphones, you&#39;ll need an adapter for that. That&#39;s what comes in the box. Hate wires? You can get bluetooth headphones.

Disliked, who stupid will take their phones and drill a literal hole in it that might damage the phone. This is like technical how to basic.
People actually did this.... Humanity was a mistake

Fuck you ass hole

Apple should watch your videos and correct themselves.
It my be obvious if the speaker can travel to the wire but the headphones need a battery for it to work
Literally the majority of the dislikes are the extremely gullible people who actually tried this
BRO WTF IS THIS HOW TO BREAK YOUR IPHONE TF
Just got iphone 7 plus from my brother, and there&#39;s no hole for earphone. I died, i don&#39;t like use airpod, the sound quality is not good and not loud enough to mee ----<i>_</i>-----

It looks right but i know it&#39;s wrong😂
This is iphone 8
Oops. It&#39;s a clickbait

Everything is fun and games until you hit the battery
This video is for people that think that AirPods or EarPods with Lightning Connecter isn’t necessary
What the fuck??!!?!??!?!?!?! Lol I love this prank hack! Holy shit! I love you man
Dont dislike because he scamed you like because he was just making a funny joke
YOOO IT STILL WORKS IN 2020
idk why but I feel like he’s serious even tho it’s a joke
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqH-Un9SFU&amp;t=69">1:09</a> I love how you can still hear the music
Lol
@appleindia

iPhone 7 blacks the headphone jack
Me<br>See dislikes <br>Me <br>ROTFL 😂
I don’t know why but the music playing out loud is what killed me
I thought he was serious about this. But, he is doing this because he is just mad for most of the smartphones are running out of head phone jack especially, in these days and I know why this video is so incredibly fast!!!
I tried it but it didn’t work
&lt;s&gt; thank techrax, but what do i do if my phone wont turn on? i mightve used a wrong drill bit...&lt;/s&gt;
3 years and its still working for my iphone 11 max pro... thank you.. can i drill 1 more so that me and my frnd can listen simultaneously?
that works too <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ofzj1hnIs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ofzj1hnIs</a>
The music still comes from the phone though...
Dude it’s three years later and I still have an iPhone 7
This is genius! <br><br><b>*Update*</b><br>it also works on my iPhone 11 Pro!<br>And my toaster
Wouldn’t that break your iPhone 7?!
tf
I try on 11 pro max its working thank you so much ;)
Autism is a common thing in the youtube community. Dont sweat about it.
I think i did it on the wrong side
People who are stupid enough to buy an iPhone are clearly stupid enough to do this
Atleast the dislike button still works!
thoes this actually work?<br><br>Edit: i think i‘m dumb or fooled.
It did not work
OP
Yes, i am from internet historien but the thing that worries me even more that people believed this is that you can literlly hear the phone play the music also how would you record that why do people stupider than i exist? nobody knows...
I Just watch this cuz its so stupid
We knew was fake but the lolz count
Just get android if you want to have a headphone jack
N Rc HQ5gh
Worked for me thanks dude 👍
IT WORKED, I CAN NOW HEAR WITH THE EARBUDS, OMG THANKYOU TECHRAX
does this still work on the iphone xr? i tried it but my phone shut off
Who fell for this 😂
Fuck you 😡😡 😠😠
If you are in need of a professional and ethical hacker to help you spy on your spouse device to know if you are being cheated on? contact ( hex_hacker09 @|G ), he hacks into deleted record, improve credit score, spy on whats-app, text, phone, emails, as long as it&#39;s hack am 100% sure you will get results because he has also worked for me and i got results tell him i referred you to him.
iPhone looks better with out headphone jack
This is clearly fake because when he played the music, it&#39;s still playing music out loud from the speakers, when you plug the headphones in, you&#39;d not hear anything from the speakers. Call it bullshit! 😂😂😂
WTF
Thank youuuuuu I needed some way to use my headphones with my 7. Super helpful and it worked almost instantly. The bottom of my screen has a black bar at the bottom but I think that’s just some dust. It’s working perfect
That&#39;s bull shit
Ass hole
The new How2Basic
Lol
I thought this would work when I first saw this. I’m glad I didn’t go through with it.
DONT DO THIS You’re phone will brake
I tried it and had to go back to the Apple store to get it repaired and they asked me why I drilled a hole in the bottom of my phone and I said a YouTuber said to do it and my EarPods would work I’m so confused
Don&#39;t forget to wash your phone in the sink every so often because it will make it go faster 🤗
Dirty scumbag you know how retarded some people are why encourage them to break their phone what if they can&#39;t afford another
But I have Samsung Galaxy Tab a it is not broken
I drilled 2 holes, now my friends can listen too!! were my 4.8k likes
Accidentally let my phone sip my energy drink now it won’t turn off and die help
This was a very bad time to post the video. He should&#39;ve posted this at april fools so it wouldn&#39;t be as believable and people wouldn&#39;t fall for it as easily.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqH-Un9SFU&amp;t=7">0:07</a> Lacks the headphone jack?
118k people drilled holes in their iphones!   ROFLMAO!!!!!
IT WORKS IT WORKS...<br><br>The dislike button works
You can hear the music threw the phone at the end bro
Works, but Taptic Engine no longer works.
alguien sabe que dijo ? :v
For a second I actually thought you were trying to click bait people with this Wow I’m stupid
No way I&#39;m not gonna do that if you are wearing headphones why do we hear it
Lol
Why they did that its very stupid idea 🙂
Maybe you can improve by taking the headphone jack of the the older iphones and mount it on the iphone 7 chip board and you will get a real headphone jack out of your iphone 7!
He&#39;s just telling you to break your phone
April fool
When you realize it’s still playing out did the head phones
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hey... guys.... I made my phone holey
How can you hear the outer voice and it&#39;s a very mad thing you now

Instructions unclear accidentally swallowed my phone it turned on airplane mode and started flying me up in the sky
chutiya mat bana
I got a wireless earbuds add on this video.
Your iphone is temporary but the dumbness of humanity is eternal. <br><br>This is fake guys,  just buy a lightning jack adapter or a bluetooth headphone.<br>Or if you have the knowledge to do, just make a diy jack socket. <br>This is very funny how many people tried out this.
119k dislikes?! I guess people really thought there was a secret hack to get a headphone jack.
i already drill both holes but they fall out
I have a problem techrax when i try to put it in it slips out and it doesnt stay in, what to do?
My torch didn&#39;t work. I drilled a hole big enough to put a torch through. <br>Thanks for the advice!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha tgat dance though
HHahaha
This video is still legend.
Thanks, Now my phone has autism

I can&#39;t believe people actually tried this XD
118,000 Trump voters disliked this video. Now they&#39;re working on the bleach and UV cure.
WOAH BRO
I don&#39;t think it breaks your phone because where he drilled the hole is where there&#39;s a useless piece of plastic
Funniest vid ever, &quot;And you enjoy the music!&quot;
This is so fake
RIP taptic engine

Is this How To Basic lol
I did this to my iPhone 7 and it worked! *because I went to China and got the iPhone 6 headphone jack parts
Wow techrax you are electronic engineer
omg! this still works o newer models 😱<br>if it doesn&#39;t you just need to drill deeper
Duh like for real? <br>Who would use a drill and risk getting shavings inside your phone plus he should&#39;ve At least used oil. I used the pointy tip that came with with this soldering iron/wood burner thingy. <br><br><br>I tried making my toaster wireless but forgot to unplug it first and think my iPhone was too close and the free flying electrons fried my phone before I could profit from my new headfone port.
Whoever fell for this doesnt deserve a phone tbh.
I was expecting him to have the volume off to make it obvious
Fake
If you are going to use a new phone, it will be
does it actually work though
Ja ja ja
Why u lying for?
It didn’t even work! Your just wasting your money!
Bye the way this is fake and he is a asshole and a scammer

WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

Good joke lmao

How gets this video 190.000 likes
The people who actually do this are the same people who believe squiring limes in your eyes will make your eyes green.
He plugs the headphones, the music still comes out of the speakers, and some morons still thought this would work. XD I can&#39;t believe people are this stupid.
&quot;Well then you can just get another type of adapter&quot;<br><br>&quot;So like a double dongle&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, like a double dongle&quot;
The dislikes on the video are people who rhought they gonna get free vbucks
If your phone broke after this put it in rice.
I drilled hole in my head and now i can listen even other peaples minds.
All the dislikes are from the  stupid people that actually tried it😂😂
<b>Someone 2020?</b>
This is literally on CNN
Fake
Did this with my iPhone 7 7 plus and 8 and 8 plus all have headphone jacks no issues works great thank you for the great advice
Humanity must be destroyed.<br>Completely. 😆

This guy so stupid <br>He just drill the speaker<br>So fucking stupid

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqH-Un9SFU&amp;t=78">1:18</a> what is he doing with his hands
Pls tell me is it fake
Don&#39;t hear about the guys who said it doesn&#39;t work.<br>I have experience at metalwork so i did it and it works pretty fine.<br>You need to take a 3.5mm stainless steel drill bit and center it first so the drill does not slip off. That&#39;s what you learn in education.<br>After that you have to start the drill and insert the drill at maximum speed with 1mm feed.<br>After that you have to deburr hole, I recommend a commercial sinker.<br>Once this is done, you have to remove the chips with compressed air and now you can connect headphones.
HAHAHAHAHAHAH best troll 2016.
Fuck off
😂
This is still funny 3 years later.
1 second of silence to those who thought it was real

The more holes you drill, the more headphones you can plug in, or just don’t drop your wireless headphones
This is fake as fuck.....
If it was real it would have no sound
Wow you have my iPhone 7
Jajajaaj the people are idiot jejeje
I&#39;m still quite impressed nothing really broke for a hole that deep
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqH-Un9SFU&amp;t=36">0:36</a> it means you are on my way to buy a new iphone
What does the iPhone read at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqH-Un9SFU&amp;t=39">0:39</a>?<br><br><br><br>Also this is iPhone rape.
Lol
My iPhone 7 broke
the whole point  is so only you can hear it but when u pressed play it was playing normally
If ppl actually tried this and thought it would work well... I think that alone is what will lead up to the apocalypse😂
I tried it on my iPhone 11 Pro Max, and it perfectly works!
I drilled 10 holes now my family can listen
I just found this video and it works perfectly! I drilled one hole so now me and my friends can all listen together! 10/10
If you&#39;re willing to void your warranty and possible damage your iPhone&#39;s speaker. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this at all. You&#39;re just asking for trouble to spend more money to fix your iPhone rather than getting your ass up and go to Best Buy or <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> to purchase a headphone and charging adapter that can do both for a good price that doesn&#39;t do too much damage to your wallet.
I’ve never got click baited this hard 💔
So cool I tried on my iPhone XR
....how many iPhones lay victim to the need, Rest In Peace ✌🏼 young gadget, there’s a heaven for thee.... Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of your death...<br>....y’all drillin’ &amp; we have the last ones left, but life goes on.....
The 117,000 dislikes are from people who are stupid, and dont understand comedy
R.I.P water proof
No one is gonna comment that the sound should get out from the headphone?
I drilled 4 holes and now my family can listen with me!

Which life decisions bring us here?
Thaaank you so much it work for my iphone 8 plus ❣️🙂🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥
I knew it wouldn&#39;t be simple because of how short the video was!
You need to use air pods! To listen to stuff on that iPhone!!!
Ok I will not do that just to listen to my iPhone (if I had one but I have an iPod) but I’ll use it to get the headphone jack out
Wait WHERE THE FUCK IS THE HEADPHONE SLOT FOR HIS PHONE?!
Can you also use a knife to do it?
Yes I’m going to do that it’s the only way to get this headphone jack out!
I done everything you shown but there is no sound from my headphones,  i think i have to get a new one.. Think this is dead
OMG IT WORKED NOW I MADE TWO HEADPHONE JACKS ONE FOR ME AND ONE FOR A FRIEND THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For some reason I hoped this would of achully worked
So fake

<b>Moral of the video drill a hole in your iPhone 7</b>
my mom said when you see people like this look away but i just stabbed my eye
Its fake !!!!!!!!
2019?
I&#39;ve already drilled the hole but I cannot test it yet because my phone turned off during the process, I think it ran out of battery. I&#39;ll try it when it&#39;s charged, thank you TechRax!
thanks to techrax for creating  natural selection for i phones
THX IT WORKED
IT WORKED OMG OMG THX
Lol
Stupid
You know Apple sheeps are desperate and dumb enough to actually try this
You could just get a dongle
How to break the phone your mom gave you
rip to the people who tried it
Stupid stupid stupid
😂😂
Apple users while watching this:-<br><br>Why are we still here?  Just to suffer😭
what the fuck
I dont need to drill a hole in my phone cuz I AM A SAMSUNG USER! :D
Ahahaha
does this really work or is it just Sarcasm... im confused 🤔
nice trolling m8
Chutiya
I don&#39;t think it worked. I tried this but while drilling the hole Siri started singing Daisy Bell then her brain melted and I now own an Apple Brick.
Its a little bit like how to basic 😳😏
I wish I watched the full video before I broke my new phone
Haha
Hello sir it doesn&#39;t <a href="http://work.help/">work.help</a> me !
This made me unsubscribe watch strange parts he actually does it and it takes him weeks
people can be really, really stupid...
will you make a video for a similar video for the Note 10? Lots of people are mad about the loss of the headphone jack on the Samsung Note 10.
Finally all those morons who cry because of the lack of their stupid jack 3.5 mm will have a brand new like phone.
l
Apple&#39;s gonna sue you
Hahaha
Nice dancing
Must I go a bit deeper if it keeps buffering?
LUL
Hahahhaha what the fuck is this
this way is good to broke an iphone 7 for 2 minutes
It kinda looks real tho lmao
You have to buy a drill from apple to make it works!
More easier trick is <br><br><br><br><br><br>Get 6s or older iPhones
😂😂😂😂
Does it work with the Note10?
I tried it with my Nokia 3310 and I am happy to report it didn’t work since the drill broke
<b>!!!!1!1!!1!1!</b>
I don’t know if I should like or dislike
That’s silly won’t your phone break
LMAOO
Lmao why does this have a lot of dislikes. Is it because you&#39;re destroying a brand new phone, or because someone attempted this?
Um in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqH-Un9SFU&amp;t=70">1:10</a> it have music that you can hear
To all the dislikers, this is a joke. OK?
His crazy
I’m surprised it still works
strange parts made this a reality
omg this actually works this is amazing<br><br><br>thank you so much<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>i did it on my nokia now the drill has a headphone jack :D now i can hear it drill better
This is so absurd
It doesn&#39;t work I could hear the music playing off of the phone
Him: <b>puts the phone at that... thing</b><br>Phone: <b>scrolling around the screen</b><br>Me: I think that iPhone is truly hacked
Fuck rax dmyo destroyed my I phone xr
I thought is what’s real

Click bate asshole
Wait a sec, why the hell are some many dislikes?
Not true
Techrax is rlly stubourn
This actually works. No joke.
Or you can get a new phone
uhhh,<br><br>I DIDNT FUCKING HEAR THE MUSIC FROM THE HEADPHONESS
If you do this, it kills the water resistance
U real stupid
Good job
This only works on the iPhone 8 not 7 and up
Actually it doesn&#39;t work, tried it myself with iphone X ($955.000.00) and died... Waste of money
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣LOL
This is probably the first clickbait video I’ve seen which actually has more like than dislikes
I did not do it because I am smart enough to not destroy this
I was curious so I clicked, did not try, clickbait!
I tried this and I destroyed my phone. pLeAsE hElP. i HaTe YoU tEcH rEx
Since some people are still having issues, a bit of advice. The guy seems to have missed the part about cleaning the phone after drilling.<br><br>In order to clean out the 3.5 mm socket of debris from the drill you need to soak the phone in soapy water for around 15 minutes so all the drill shavings are loosened.<br><br>Then give the phone a shake once you’re done. Hope this helps someone :D
3 years later AirPods are popular
IDIOTS DONT LISTEN TO HIM YOUR GONNA BREAK YOUR IPHONE 😡😡😡
I don’t want to ruin my phone lol
ur stupid.
Bro I tryed. It actually works if I just burn it!
You made all yo fans lose cash??
I&#39;m surprised that your phone still works<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer: I didn&#39;t try it, simple common sense
That&#39;s <del>fucked</del> up
This channel is basically how to basic for tech...
Omg I did this and it worked!
Enjoy the music from the hole in the speakers<br>Thanks
That sounded lliiike it was coming from the speakers
To let you know the music is just playing on the phone not the headphones most likely the song was pre recorded because cameras don&#39;t have ears to put the headphones in big fat lair
Fucking liar
, I suggest you use a centre punch first with a 4 pound hammer , this will stop the drill slipping , I used to be a tool maker so know what I’m talking about !<br>Good for a school DT project
does this work with the $999 mac pro stand?
The fact that I can see some stupid kid gonna drill into his phone 😂😂😂😂😂
why r/woooosh<br><br>when you can r/wosh
hahahahahahaha you miss that painting need black
😂😂😂😂
You crazy or smg
STUPID! hahaha
I drilled tons of holes then my parents took me to get a new one 😔
Gay
Yes work and also share with my enemies
You don&#39;t need to drill a hole, just put the phone in the back pocket of your jean than plug earphone jack to your asshole.
Works great, thanks I love the new ipoone nanu
This dude is so dumb I can even fathom
damn a lot of butthurt people
Drilling A Hole In An iPhone 7 Is Not A Good Idea. Why Don’t You Get A Samsung Galaxy S7 Or Use Bluetooth Audio
Never ever do it!
You all are a bunch of brain dead idiots.
Report this shit.
how many phone did you broke until it became successful😂?
the ironic thing is, most people it doesnt work, but Strange Parts made himself one on his 7, soooooooo up yours
Unfortunately this only works with the Apple iDrill :(
Are people actually that dumb?<br><br>116K dislikes are dumbfucks who don’t know how phones work!
Excuse me wtf

Instructions werent clear:<br>My old iPhone 7 cought fire and the drill blew up. Now my house is burnt down.
Instructions not clear,got my balls stuck in a mouse trap
I try it. IT WORK but not have of my sreen is black
I remember dying inside a little bit knowing how many people fell for this back then. How can so many people be so fucking clueless and gullible?
Instructions unclear, ended up putting my phone on Airplane Mode and it flew away.
The apple fanbase summed up in four words: people fell for this.
Yeah this video hurts my soul
Wtf u drilled a hole in a iPhone
Instructions not clear - drilled phone and now it&#39;s telling me I should get tested for elctro-gonorrhea
thanks it worked!
There are actual people who did this to there phone and those are the kind people who are going to bring us back to the dark ages

Finally I can plug the headphone into iPhone 7 and enjoy the porn without worrying the kids may hear it. Thank man.
What was I expecting
C Oh hell no
This wouldn&#39;t work in any way it literally would go through the circuit board
Lol.
Drill 5 holes and you can share your music with your friends.

That is not how you get the headphone jack back that’s destroying the electronics
They are called AirPods
Lol everytime I get angry about being no headphone jack on no speakers I just create my own and show it to my friends and there like wtf r u doing
116K are dumb Apple fans that thought it would work
It works lol &lt;3
Thank you so much!!!! I have been wanting one on my iPhone X and it’s amazing thank you so much!!
So according to Apple the didn&#39;t have enough space to fit a headphone jack into the phone, yet it works without any problems after this dude just drilled a hole of the same size into the phone....
What the hell is that man oh my god that is amazing awesome🤣🤣🤣👌🏻👍🏻
This worked on my phone, I don&#39;t know why others are having issues with this. They must have done it wrong.
I literally don’t see any comments of people complaining this isn’t working. All I see are comments complaining about people who are complaining this isn’t working.
Jajajajajaja
This video is so dumb!!!!!
Why can we can hear the music when the ear phone are in ???????
Why you just don’t buy a adaptor??
If u want to party
RIP to all those Idiots who tried this
Idiot, it doesn&#39;t work

When you clamp the iphone in the vise you might want to put 2 pieces of wood between the vise and the iphone so you dont damage the screen
Yes! My I phone 7 plus no headphones
Why didn’t it come with a jack?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqH-Un9SFU&amp;t=39">0:39</a> why was that random shit opened? Lol
This is one of the best iPhone videos you&#39;ve ever done Techrax. I hope you do something like this again in the future. May thousands more people break their phones. Since 4chan has been inactive lately you&#39;re our only hope.
Nice copy of ssnapcase
This video show that appcle could perfectly install a headphone jack in the iphone 7
You need to had a really serius problem (Tard) in your brain if you actualy Belive in these bullshit... Now I have less faith in humanity after this... Please, someone press the Damn red buttom to reset all of this madness
