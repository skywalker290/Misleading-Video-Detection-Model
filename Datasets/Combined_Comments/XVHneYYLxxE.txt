My Life Best Video Show
Real
Kuch log sach me ek kharab nazariye se dekh rhe the pr kuch sirf acid attack victims ko dekh rhe the wo sirf samaaj ki burai ek begunaah insaan ke chehre ko kharaab krne ki besharmiyat wali harkat  dekh rhe the.
If you are gonna look horrifying people will obviously get scared, it is not there mistake. However laws against acid attack and rape needs to more harsh, should be worse than death sentence. India needs some sharia laws in the constitution.
Chutiya public h saala khudke sath naa ho tb tk saalo ko akal ni aati bc gussa aati h ese logo par 😒

😭😭🙏🙏 give respect women
This world is cruel! 😢😢😢
Deepika Padukone is the best
A real human beings are not make by outer appearance a good human being made by heart ❤️.
Sorry madam but it was very hard to get changed the mindset
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=39">0:39</a> Deepika Padukone is at Colaba At Popy Shop. I stay there😭
Deepika is fake.....trying to use every oppurtunity for publicity
Tum hame sikhoge drugies
Girls are also humans . Acids are not even thrown on dogs . Girls love their face alot this does not mean that u&#39;ll throw acid on their face just to make them sit at home and stop their progress . Everyone has their own rights guys . Please stop these kinds of crime against women (humans) . <br><br>And I also want convey to the foolish people around who judge a person by their facial beauty . They think that if they&#39;ll talk or say some kind words to a survival  their value will low down in the society but it&#39;s not so when u show kindness to a needy ur value increases more that it was .
You people make anything out of anything ! It&#39;s the nature of every living being, we generally watch things that are not usual, otherwise we just see. Are you thinking it&#39;s normal to have this ? Are you normalising this ? This is not normal, whoever experienced this, surely he/she didn&#39;t want it. It is their bravery that they survived. They survived in a condition that whenever one sees them, they watch them, watch them that the person is living after bearing such conditions. Don&#39;t you find any good thing in this. Most of reactions that you showed, are not negitive but you just slow motioned them like hell ! Think again, it&#39;s not normal, crime is not normal, and after this much happening, surviving is not normal, that&#39;s why all watch them, not just see and go. Note - don&#39;t reply, I won&#39;t. All I have to say is here.
#💝True india  shown 💝💞
I expected that ..
Nice
Please don&#39;t promote druggist. This lady for pro outing the movie could forsake her country. Only mo ey is their God. Had my mother had the money she had she would have been way prettier with so many facial, creams and make up. But<br>She was beautiful from inside.
They are people sees in good way and the sad really is They are people sees in bad way
I just want to share this here, when i was studying in school. One of my junior&#39;s mom was an acid attack survivor. She use to come daily to drop &amp; pick her daughter. I use to admire her very much. I remember her always wearing beautiful lipshades &amp; that warm contagious smile💗. I really don&#39;t k were u r aunty now (hope u r fine). But thanks for sowing that positivity seed in my during that adolescent age.💕💞💕💞✨💫
I&#39;m just thinking they doesn&#39;t see when they puting the cameras out there!
Shame on another women who are looking with weird expression and treating them as untouchable..Just shame on them😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡

Education can only give knowledge right or wrong but we have to change the people by their heart .
No one is ugly , everyone should not judge them and everyone should have a clean and pure heat and soul .
E world lo ela vuntundi antay gayam chesinavadu baguntaru gaiapadinavadu bada padatari that is true fact
Shame on u all people. Agar kisi ki help na kar sako to dard v mat do
when normal deepika come out street with her natural look then people will stare with same as shown in video but there will no &#39;dhang dhang&#39; music.<br>afterall Bollywood r ruled by some illtreated people, and this video reflect their mind set.
I would have recognised Deepika from 10ft distance 🥰🥰
After seeing Chappak or another pathetic story of acid attack victims many people can be sympathised and pitiful but in REAL LIFE what those people think about them has revealed 🥲🥲💔💔
I am angry when I see acid attack victims as I hate that girls still have to go through all this just because fragile male ego can’t handle being told no   <br>To every female who has been through shit just because she said no, I ADMIRE YOU and SENDING YOU TONS OF LOVE <br>- A fellow female
Sad
merepe to acid attack kuch ni hua fir bhi iss se bhi ganda aur ajeeb dhang se log dekhte hai ..uska kya
I was thinking about the people who were standing and looking at Deepika Padukone..but couldn&#39;t recognise her!!!
Last me jab uss ladie ne apne backo ko kara that was so so wrong and yaar acid attack hua hein unke sath unhone koi glat kaam nahi kiya jse aap log unse najre zukka re that was so bad thing 😠😠
10nth january is my birthday
Looks don&#39;t matter, <b>Heart</b> matters..And this only things should be of all the peoples
India is love par yahe pe rahene wale kuch log ise ganda karte hai respect girlls
can someone explain to me what happened @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=127">2:07</a>
Most of them were shocked more then disgusted....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=153">2:33</a> it&#39;s ok coz chote bacche darte hai
This is very bad😭😭😭😭
That movement when those who disguised at malti know that she is deepika padukone
Everything has its own beauty not everyone can see it .....<br>No one is born ugly just society is judgedmental
i agree!!!!!!!!!!!! It&#39;s time for us
these are the people who boasts as if they are socialising and pretend to be matured but actually they are shit.
Itna he discrimination dikhate ho....to Sabhi celebrities inhi se marriage krni chaiye ...samaj ki burai to har koi dikhata hai....use khatam Karne ke liye apana yogdan  koi nhi deta.....<br><br>It&#39;s only for spreading negativity 😭😭
deepika you are my all time fav actress from om shanti om to padmavat and now chhapaak . this a very big step which you took and god is with you and will be for every in your life .people may say you take drug or any thing i know you are not that kind of actress . god and my blessings will be there for every your life
how Rude!<br>these people who are making faces are nobody did you hear &quot;NOBODY&quot;. They are making faces as if they are the creators of them..<br>I am not sorry to say that people of our country have become shameless 😡😡😠
Some women who are scrunching up their face are doing so maybe because they can never imagine the pain that the survivors have gone through. Like it&#39;s almost unbelievable to them and it&#39;s not because they don&#39;t like how they look!!!!! <br>Itna dramatic hona shayad zaroori nhi tha.
Ewwwwwwwwww🤮🤮
Jo log in ladkiyon ke sath acha behaviour nhi kr rhe jab inki behen beti ya bahu ya ghar ki kisi ladki pe acid attack hoga na tab inhe pata chalega
Zaroori nahi hai ki har waqt jaise “society” soche, humein bhi wohi sochna padega..... kyunki yeh wohi society hai jisne , unfortunately ,pagalon ki tarah “beauty” ko glamorize kar ke rakhha hua hai....”ugly” ko nahi..... and truth is always ugly, so no one likes it.
Deepika = nautanki
Hope these people who looked at her with disgust gets recognised by maximum people. That is their punishment. Hope you guys read this and get ashamed. Idiots shame on you forever!!!!!!!
C&#39;mon people was just looking normally don&#39;t make it a big issue!
a random woman: mein upar se nahi pehenti <br>me: voh apko pehene ke liye bol bhi nahi rahi thi, pehle thik se sun lo phir apna ganda muh kholo plz, boht badbu aati he
when people see something different they tend to look again
I have never a cheapest publicity done for any movie. I was a fan of you Deepika. Not anymore. The person behind this concept of the video or editing of the video, specially &quot;dhanan dhanan&quot; sound, Shame on you.
some dude just looked at her for like a Second and .... dhan dhan dhan dhan dhan
Actually thay didn&#39;t make up ugly, they did this experiment with ugly mind. People reaction are not bad.
People are negative and the editor too lol.
I love the way she said thank you 😣🤗 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=87">1:27</a>
Aisa kiya dikhna chata hu aisa tu kisi koi rect nahi kiya kisi na kuch sab insaan ek saman hai
All the people&#39;s were dumbstruck, when locking them
Lord Jesus bless everyone
There are both types of people in society, those who understand others and those who are laugh in the problems of others.
Everyone please understand the message delivered is beautiful but also understand this is scripted ...these are not real people reaction they are actors see how people saw camera and reacted...a camera around them and no one gets astonished and gives perfect shots for behaving so ....
That why corona virus attack people.
women is biggest enemy of women&#39;s
dude this is too dramatic, tbh I would’ve stared at them as well but not full of disgust.
Well, for most of the people, I didn&#39;t think there was anything bad about their gaze. They just looked normally. There was nothing awful or judgemental about their gaze.But it doesn&#39;t mean that they are not being judged, many others must have judged them (also seen in the video). But it was more dramatised for normal gazes. Of course if it was Deepika they would have asked for an autograph or selfie but with random common citizens who does?
It&#39;s worse that people have bad mindset for these people but happy to see that some are cooperative too👍👍👍
Like wth deepika is like sometimes i feel like hiding my self so people dont recognize me but with disguising herself as a acid attack victim there could be nothing more insensitive than this and she even calls this &#39;look&#39; unbelievable
So poor minded people 🥺
They are the most beautiful women in the world nobody can judge them by their looks.
So what? She is doing all this all because of her <br>Movie
Dislikes for this are from those disgusting looks giving fellow in video..
Most of their mentality level was 0%<br>Their reaction was so cheap <br>They should know that it wasn&#39;t victim&#39;s fault.......<br>If they knew deepika was one of them then they would have just behaved like dogs and ran behind her to take selfies.....
Nazariya pehly tu aurto ko he badlane ke zarorat he <br>Kyun ke ek aurat ho kr dusri aurat ki samjne ke bjae in ledies ko dek kr koi eyebrows chada rha hai tu koi kesy face bna Raha hai <br>Sochty nhe agr inke jegeh yehi eyebrows chadane waly hoty tb
Those women who saw them with disgust must realize that there girls were much more beautiful before  ) :
I leave in Colaba
i am just thinking when they get to know that they had a selfie with Deepika . what will be their reaction!!?
If you love such stories.. then you should definitely watch malayalam film called as &#39;uyare&#39;. It&#39;s also a story about an acid attack survivor but it is definitely very much better than chhapaak. The makeup is also very realistic and story is very much motivating
Is it just me who thinks those hidden cameras are a little too big to be hidden😅😂
&quot;Sad reality of india&quot;... <br>Those who writing this are also the same people like in the video.. <br>😞😞😞
Gave some ganja
But guys did you notice the older generation was sooo humble then younger generation ...... That is why elder is always coorect
World think on face
Everyone know that she is Deepika
Kuch log actually sirf dekh rahe hai......maybe not because of disgust. Like voh 2nd wale uncle jo white mn hai unhone bus dekha tha ghoora nhi h to itna intense music kyu?
Sometimes people stares out of curiosity, pity and not because they&#39;re disgusted how they look.<br>By adding &#39;dhang dhang&#39; music on someones stare will obviously make the video negative🙄
🤔🤔
Love u Deepika
Ngl even I would have starred at them  not at disgust but I will be admiring their unique beauty srsly
RANDOM PERSON: SHE IS LOOKING BAD<br>BAD:ARE YOU MAD?.Acctually you are..
Super mam
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=82">1:22</a> that expression was disgusting!!!
Humans are corrupted.They don&#39; t realize all of us have red blood in our <a href="http://body.beauty/">body.Beauty</a> is just a temporary <a href="http://thing.skin/">thing.skin</a> is only a covering.
I would have recognized Deepika even with this makeup. 😍
some behaved strange but come on ,the ones who just looked at them for once were normal, there was no need to make it overdramatic
That&#39;s so sad
When Deepika is like this they turned disgusting, but when  she is normal they come selfies
Nobody aska these questions to a stranger.....
So change yr thoughts
It&#39;s the reality of life...... everyone must change their self n one thing what the world will look like n see what it look like...
😭😭😭😭
i know how that poor Laxmi would have felt when the world treated her with so much of disgust and shame !! C&#39;mon was it her fault that she rejected the choice doesnt she have the right to live the way she wants ?? She is also human . Peopole should  accept these  acid attack victims as  humans and not as some  alien person . Please respect the one who really needs  respect . Hats off to her !! 😇😇💖💖💕💕
Be Aware of &quot;Hidden Cameras&quot; in the Trial Rooms,Hotels,Public Places.

How disgusting deepika ko nahi pehechan rahe common people
Maal hai kya?
Appreciate they love themself which now i learn.
Let me say this.Bollywood is the most hypocritical industry ever.They give young girls complex over figure ,skin tone and looks.And then they make some normal reaction disgusting by editing and adding music.Yes, Indians can be sometime critical but bollywood is nothing less.
I feel like give a tight slap
Please kbhi mere par kariye social experiment apko pata chalega ki duniya me ache log bhi hen
I also did the same in past, <br>I regret after watching this video.
sorry to say but when I saw the thumbnail of this I got scared!🤣
What a world we live in...
SHAME ON SUCH PEOPLE
Nazariya badalna jaruri hai 🙏<br>Treat them as a normal ppl <br>We blame society but we are society so plzz change your mentality 🙏☺️<br>Respect ❣️🙌
How mean and cheap the people! Are!<br>Not everyone.....pure souls also exist! From their positivity the world is going on!🖤
From this I learned... to see human not their face
T

I don&#39;t understand why some people are reacting like that. I just feel so sad to know that people are having such cheap thinking. I just wana tell wake up! to them.
Shame on
There is no GOD but ALLAH and MUHAMMAD (SallAllaho alaihy walyhe waslm)is the last PROPHET of ALLAH ALMIGHTY.❤️❤️❤️
I literally started crying when I saw people reject them.
Sure face jyda iner beuti hoti bus log pehchante nhi
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cancelindia">#cancelindia</a> <br>I literally hate this country, misogyny at its peak and judgemental society.
God bless you Deepika and all your team😢👏👏👏👏
Reality can be often disappointing..
Some humans are truly disgusting. God bless Lakshmi, Deepika and Meghna for making such a beautiful movie. Change people before your life runs out. Shame 💔
our mothers behave the same way too. mentality of an over privileged person.
The people who made faces will suffer their whole life
احلى واعظم فلم بس ما نجح لان ما بي فسوق والناس تعرفون اذا مابي رقص وخلع ما تنجحه سبحان الله ر غ م انو يطرح قضيه خطيره على المجتمع
Movie promotion.....👎😠😒 It&#39;s not social experiment...Woof.....
Kaise to log hai humate desh main , kutte ki Tarah ghoor rahe hai, 35 sal ho Gaye ye ab tak Nahi badla. <br>Agle 100 sal BHI Nahi badlega .
Looking  is so important
You did not anything wrong your out side ugly but inside your a like a god for me
Govt should hang the acid throwers 👿

Really Proud of you deepika. Love  you😍
Only old people were the ones who  all respected them
What the is wrong with the indian girls. Seeing this movie they will feel pity for sometime and they start their attitude.shame on you girls who reacted like that
Jolok introverted hai uska kya 😂 jolok jyada bate nehi karte or lok jab unhe kuch puchtehe to saram khe mare jo bhag jate he....some might think it&#39;s ignorant but what if it&#39;s their introverted nature....I&#39;m not talking about the people who looked like they are disgusted though....or esehi log dusro kobhi introvert bana deta he for example that kid jiske ma ne uski akhe band ki, uski parents use socially interactive and educate nehi karegi toh badme use samaj nehi ayega na kese behave karna chahiye
Dipika is A great 💞💖
dont attack the people attack the people who sponcers them
Log acid Dal sakte hain ladkiyon ke upar to Unka Chehra Kyon Nahin dekh sakte hain

Please  Check this out.. Thank You
1.7k dislike why they all think about it when u sis mother sufferers from this problem then u also dislike this
Deepika is JUST promoting her movie!
I feel so bad... People doesn&#39;t have a humanity... So bad...
What she did in JNU
But kuch log jo normal react kar rahe the director ne unpe bhi dhumm dhana dhan lga diya <br>Jaruri nahi pyr se bt karne wala h acha ho bs
That was rediculous man that women was covering his child&#39;s face shame on them
The subject is very sensitive but is it necessary to make the video like this...do something worth...at many places has been exaggerated by editing n sound effects...n also always people aren&#39;t in good or happy mood...person unknowingly make facial expressions which is autonomic...sometimes having blank expressions on face....unknowingly staring somewhere else...it doesn&#39;t mean that saying these things over here I&#39;m supporting acid attacks....need to do something worth
We can recognize  that she is deepika mam.  This they would have done 1 or 2 yrs back.. Before announcing the movie.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=82">1:22</a> In case the woman who made a disgusted face is watching this video - Shame on you! It&#39;s disgusting to see that you are a woman yourself.
&quot; Nazaryaan badalna zaroori Hein&quot; Hats off to you Deepika
Please play this video without baground music, what I observed was people are moving with what work they have but video gimmick is showing that they are reacting wrogly. Some people may have reacted but wherever people are not reacted there also it is shown as reaction.
Shame on those people who watch them<br>Not like an humans <br>In this society people want beauty and lust only worst worst n shame on our citizens <br>They are also normal people right y u people didn&#39;t understand  <br>If that acid attack happen to u ....what will u do? Really shame shame on these people

Aankho se anshu jhalak uthe ye video dekhkr
If many have not seen a burnt face.... n reacting as a shocked person... then awareness  is the one we are missing. Awareness to make sure that they are treated equally n not just acceptance. Especially teaching children not to differentiate among people is essential.
Brave deepika padukone Love From Pakistan 🇵🇰
💛❤️😘😍🤩👍👌🔥😎
I don&#39;t understand Y a women cannot understand other women&#39;s feelings??it&#39;s pathetic
Omg this is so heartbreaking...how they were getting stared at and how some women pulled faces of disgust as if they are less worthy....very sad...it’s not their fault they became victims. They didn’t choose to be like this. People need to be more aware of their actions. Also the woman hiding her child’s face should be teaching him to accept people as they are not hide him and never teach him.
Yha comment pr acha accha likhne se pehle .. ye soch lo ki ap kesa react krte..
Desh ke bare me bhi apna najariya badlo and desh hit me na ho sake to desh ke khilaf bhi mat khade ho javo.

2.43 Badlo apna nazarya Aur apne desh ki izzat karna sikho🙏🙏🙏
The worst part of walking as acid attack survivors are people react as if you are not.
What a joke,,, deepika has done nothing to support brave Laxmi before chhapaak,,, so selfishness just for money and fame...
All the comments is positives because.......you know what I mean. Ap logo ke bhi vaise hi expression hote mere bhi.
Tum log jis acid ko banned krne ki baat karte ho.. Wahi acid pure duniya ka ghar saf karta hai... Acid ko blame mat do... Acid ek saman hai... Agar kisi ka soch badalna to wih log ka karo jo log ye sub cheez galat faida utha te hai... Ye duniya badalega nahi... Jab tak aise gande log duniya mein rehenge tab tak badalega kabhi nahi... Jo kiya hai wo sirf  <br>Ghar mein baith ke ye sub dekh rha hai... 😔😔😔

No one like deepika people only like their beautiness . It is truth

How can no one .. guess deepika&#39;s face... I could have very very very very easily.... Guessed her.... Means she&#39;s such a huge megastar and still people didn&#39;t recognized only...bcoz she was standing with the bunch of survivors...!!!! I pity... I wish I would&#39;ve been there....!!!!!!
Ur a beautiful soul deepika..... May god bless u dear
I always make sure iam not staring too much on any person no matter who that it would make them uncomfortable because a change always starts from ourselves and i believe in that
Just hate those peoples.. Insaniyat hi nahi he unlogo me.. Reactions toh dekh unki.. ☹️☹️☹️😞
atleast someone is actually working on these major issues because govt and law can do nothing rather than asking for gst and other unnecessary stupid things, standing ovation for her dedication and hardwork not only for movie promotion but giving this issue importance as well AND same for meghna ma&#39;am for choosing this social cause.
Kon kon single hai wo like kro<br>👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
Us Indians have a very bad habit of staring. We don&#39;t understand the concept of Civic decency. Sure, if you see something different, something not ordinary, you do take glance. But we , fucking, lock our eyes and just stare and make faces.
Such ridiculous person are there in our country it is a very shameful like that woman but very proud to  have people like Lakshmi and deepika who understands the situation of other people also. This is the reason why deepika is best actress in the world.
Please year please chhapaak movie Jake dekho bohot acchi movie hain year please Indian public sai mere binti hai please Jake dekho year chhapaak movie <br>I&#39;m from Bangladesh esi movie chalni chahiye year please

Hats off to Deepika<br>Being such a huge personality she came down to streets of city with those victorious survivors without even a bit of hesitation.<br>.<br>She is really an alpha woman
So sad to see the way  some people react
😞😞
This is one of the best experiments in the world...so proud of you guys to go there and share this with us

Bravo👏👏👏👏
People reactions is very worst specially women who said uper se nahi pehnugi me issse
Respect for Deepika 💓
They are shameless <br>Shame on you chiiii <br>Every acid survive are beautiful
The most weird part when the girls make weird face while seeing this that is also shameless manner.
LOGON KO APNI SOCH BADALNI CHAHIE 🙏
Agar itni hi chinta hoti to us din jnu ke sath nahi nirbhaya ke garwalo sath khadi hoti.. paiso ki bhikhari Deepika.  U r no more my favorite
Some girls reaction was really disgusting...
The people leaving negative, unsupportive comments in this comment sections are the ones who have too much pride in their country that they fail to handle criticisms from those people who are pointing out the ugly truth of Indian society. They either blame the video editor or they come up with some other ridiculous reason. Indian society needs to be taught to be more OPEN-MINDED. They are aware that their country has a high-ranking in acid attacks yet they stare at acid-attack survivors. Staring is considered to be impolite and rude in many societies overseas which is why any foreigner watching this video will come to the assumption that the people staring at Deepika and those other girls are extremely disrespectful and rude. The lady covering her son&#39;s face is already going to turn out to be a pretty bad parent if she&#39;s not going to teach her son the right things. Maybe she will learn in the future, or maybe she won&#39;t if she continues to hold such mentality just like many other people in this comment section and in India hold.
Ab sale kuch to saram karo...... Unlike dedi na samj kar... Iss video ko.... Nalayko
Some people giving the normal look but camera man showing it like a wierd one...<br>But some girls gave nasty look.<br>Good work Deepika!!!!
chhapaak ka meaning kya hai ?
Deepika padhukon is a great heroin.🌹🌹🌹🌹
Some people just took a normal look.<br>Editor typecasted them.
These cameras weren&#39;t really hidden!🤔
Insaan ho to insanijet ko semdjho...aise kisi ka tireskaar nehi kerna chahije...doenia gol hai..jai ramji ki
The problem is in countries like india, people actually stare too much and continue staring even after one glanc  in places like the uk we tend to not want to stare at people&#39;s faces as it&#39;s awkward and  rude if the person ends up seeing you looking at them and it just gets awkward.
No English captions
Chhapak   dhapak  🤣🤣🤣
You should blur the faces <br>Those who ignored  u becoz <br>Its there choices  .!
Yeh <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=154">2:34</a> vala too much hogaya...  Editor kuch bhi edit karke daaldetha...
Deepika you are an amazing soul. Just how amazing it is that nobody realised  dat it cud be you. Nice social experiment. We need more like these..
Some disgusting people out there!!
You&#39;re great depeeka❤️💙
Just keep intention of good deepika
Desh main 50 crore chutiya hain toh kya 50 crore ache bhi hain...soch badlo.....Desh jarur badelaga
Worst movie ever.... Padu kon
Awesome dipika mam r u real indian baki sab sale paisa kamane lage he..
Very nice deepika mam
Deepika and Laxmi obviously  are the true inspiration of the acid attack survivals...don’t even fkg care about the. People who are blaming you for JNU...hats of to the girls it’s to hard to live in society these days because of poor people behaviour ... but these girls never give up
Sad reality of this cruel world....😑😑😑😑
Can anybody tell me  that what i have to do when i see someone like this ? I will do a normal eye contact with them
It&#39;s world known truth noone likes to see ugly faces! That&#39;s the reason these heroines are hired! Deepika what do u expect them to do?!  Even  a dark skin person is given same look as these ladies!It&#39;s human dear!
I as a man who hasnt seen an acid victim in real life want to put few of my thoughts.<br>If someday i came across one, I would be looking at them like many people in this video did. <br>Not because i hate them or it makes me uncomfotable but because i haven&#39;t seen them in flesh. So i blame the editor here for few place where be put that sound and edit. They were normal look.<br>AND for few people who were rude to them should be getting moral lessons and classes. Especially that girl at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=82">1:22</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=83">1:23</a> and that mother.<br><br>Msg for the mother.<br>Their face is not scary so you shouldn&#39;t be covering your sons face. You should let your son see and tell him what happened.
they r definitely not a hidden camera
The girl at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=82">1:22</a> is so mean cheapooo
We have always help to the acid attack survivors please🙏🏻🙏🏻☝🏻
Honestly I can never trust dipika, she has somehthing which makes her not trustworthy like she has a shield which she never drops.
Chhapaak is an exceptional film, brought to life by three immensely talented women, @deepikapadukone @meghnagulzar and @atikachohan. This is great cinema, powered by the female gaze, do not miss this.
Wow !! Deepika u r fabulous
Well,what do you expect from people?India itself is a racist country.
Hats off
I FEEL THAT SOCIETY NEVER MAKES IT EASY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM ISSUES LIKE ACID ATTACK AND RAPE BUT YET THESE GIRLS ARE STRIVING TO LIVE. <br>TRUE WARRIORS.❤❤💖💖
Kese log hain ye jo itna bura behav kr rahay hain jese insaan hi nahi hain acid attack survival... Im with u all n great work deepika  i love u alot Jaan ho aap meri sis... Apki jesi nature soch or dil Allah subko day Ameen brave girls hats off ... Love from Karachi Pakistan❤ ❤ ❤

Kon bewakoof log hain yar ye kese shakal banate hain dekh kar 😒😔
# there is a indian dramas touch in the video....🕵🙈😝
In ke kbhi najariyi badali ge nhi kyu ke in ke soch choti h choti soch wali kbhi apni soch ko badli ge nhi na he asid girl ko agi badhi be nhi de ge..
Great job mam
Shame on those women who look at acid attack victims with disgust these type of people have no empathy just shame on them. ☹
Seeing this video I felt shameless for a moment being an Indian
Nice movie 👌👌👌👌
Je mu bura babn rehi hen.on sath bi je ho sakta ha
You are great mam
Kaise react kar rahe the omg .shocking
Just think how they resist these behaviour every day. It gave me goosebumps. I mean just put yourself for 1 minute in their place. You will definitely have goosebumps like I had. Laxmi agarwal is so true that acid is in our minds. We need to get rid of it immediately or it will burn our whole brain.
Reality check
Concept is awesome! May God bless all the girls
Everyone here talks as if they have never do this to this people<br> <br>U r the most fake guys
Everyone in this video&#39;s commend only talks about indian peopla mentality...<br>When this comes to u will u guys follow it
I&#39;m also a girl,  but there is no single words to say... U Deepika really really.. Hat&#39;s off u and all &quot;chhapaak&quot; team members ....&quot;no words, only tears in my eyes.... And also credit goes to Laxmi... Kamal ki lady....hat&#39;s off.. 😘😘😘👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍
Aaj kch maha kamine kutte log hai india me jinki soch 2 kodi ki hai yea mar kyu nhi jaate
<b>**Massage thoda Lamba hai but padiyega jarur I request to you**</b><br><br>Deepika mam log aise dekh rahe the jaise ki ye apko nahi kisi bhut Ko dekh liya ho. Jaise lagta hai ki ham is society ke lete ham ek abhishap hai jaise hamne Apne sath khud hi Bura Kiya hai . Sab upper se bahut dikhate hai aur bahut hi shantava dete hai ki ham apke sath hai. But really life me bilkul iska opposite hai but main ye nahi kahti ki inke jaise sab log hote hai is video me kuch aise log hui hai jo apka support karte hai. Itni sare log apki movie &quot; CHAPPAK &quot; dekhne ja rahe hai but as a movie but unhe ye nahi pata hoga ki is movie se hame ek Shikh multi hai and I am really sorry agr meri bat ka Bura Laga ho but ye sach hai and all the best 👍 for your movie .
Thank you deepika Salaam hai apko dear<br>God bless you
deepika is doing alot
Right
Normal looks ko bhi edit karke dikha do kuch bhi 🤪
The people who unliked this video will be the people made faces in the video isn&#39;t i m right?<br>If yes then hit like
Beauty is inside not outside
These are idiots of high level , biggest shame .😡 <br>Mera Bharat mahaan 😑
Here people are reacting like those crawd was soo bad soo rude and explaining they should be little kind to those people and they are getting offended but first look at ourself.i dont know about others but unfortunately I’ll be in that crawd i think i had done the same as the crawd as behave(ingnoring such people) and i feel sorry for myself but this had teached me a things to behave nice to everyone and i think this video has showm me mirror. Dont comment about anyone who was cruel to them ask yourself you feel bad because you might I repeat maybe you might have done same thing..
this is reality of india hum sarkar ko gali dete hai yaha main khud apne aap me kitna sahi hu ..?
they are warrior i just die if everyone givs such a riduculous reactions
The great Dipika...!!👌👌<br>😱
Aurat hi aurat ki dushman hai
👍👍🙏🙏🙏👌👌good work mam
The people are really like this, they should just change now
Har insaan ka ek comfort zone hota hai har insaan har situation ko handal nhi kar pata <br>Please take it just an example har koi dead body nhi dekh pata kyuki wo comfortable nhi hota I am not compairing these girls with body but it&#39;s just that ki har insaan har cheej nhi Dekh Sakta aur ye human nature  hai. koi Jada mature hota hai koi nhi hota. Kuch log positive react karte hai kuch negative aur kuch react hi nhi karte 2 ya 3 minute ke video ke basis pe kisi ko judge Karna is not good <br>Just a question ye experiment movie aane ke phele thoda phele hi kyun hua aaj se 1 ya 2 Saal phele kyun nhi
Think what will happen if people came 2 no that d ignored girl is deepika padukon ❤<br>What will u do in there place?<br>Me-I&#39;ll take selfies wid them n upload by telling that I&#39;m luckiest person born to take selfies wid goddess❤
Well done experiment.. facts or truth revealed.... Grt Deepika
I’m respecting the acid attack survivors
1447 kon kutte  he jo dislike  kar rahe he in kutto ko panjab bhajo kille kille di kutte
Ye mjak kiya gya us ldki ka jo ek apni jindigi me kast jhel rhi hai uska ye film ko rilies nhi kiya jana chahiye
Dipeeka is video ka part 2 b banati, lika ka jin logo ne face mor lia un se puchti k Q mora ya Jo b
U saw the reality of many people like in the a Taf situation u need someone&#39;s help just to raise their voice but... pyaar karoo insan ko us khuda ke liye jisne tumhe banaya hai usne sabko hi banaya hai kisika ishwar kisika Allah jiska jobi hai sab ko us uparwalane banaya tho  hai
I&#39;m so proud of you Dipika
Hatsoff to u mam u r doing a great job.<br>Love u so much deepika mam and love for all the acid attack survivors❤😘😘😘
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=153">2:33</a> the mother at the end covering her son&#39;s eyes are heart-wrenching! How could people be so inhumane!
Sad thing is look at the face of ladies even
You r now faked
I think it&#39;s fake.. anyone could have recognised Deepika padukone
Scripted
Allah tala sbhi girls womens ko aise prblm s bachaye sb kise moo kr rhe h jise usmai uske glti hai kise log hai fr yhi log humanity ki baat karenge waah waah
It&#39;s not right to accuse the curious stares....I don&#39;t think they are judging.. They are just curious..... And ofcourse there are those s...... People.....We must know the difference and this publicity stunt people must have made some difference.....Just because you are from a poised society you cannot point to the other larger society of India which stares because of curiosity...
Agar ye log pehle jan lete k ye Deepika hai to har koi us k paas aata usse ache se baat karta, par ye kaha maloom hai ye log ko isiliye aisa wierd behave kya hai ... abb video dekh ne k baad ye log definitely pachta rahe hoge 😜
Love u dp ❤️
Majority people r insensible in this world
Kese log rehte hai.. Ish duniya mein aab pata chaala... Thank you fo this vdo......
its very strange ki dipika padukone  mam KO koi pehchana hi nhii
Very sad especially I believe aurat to aurat ka dard samjhe
झक्कास <br>Good<br>Work<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hRPTh_uchc">https://youtu.be/-hRPTh_uchc</a>
Waise deepika ji aap najriya kiska badalna chah rahi ho?
please respect all people they are also human like us ..
Half of the reactions were just a second glance but editor sensationalized it with that background music. And it is not just acid attack survivors, but Indians in general have a tendency to &quot;stare&quot; when they see anything or anyone different - be it differently abled, differently dressed, special needs etc. Most of them are out of curiosity and they do not understand how awkward those glances and looks can be for the person in question.
Definitely they will regret<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23if">#if</a> they come to know 😝she was not normal girl dam she was depikaaa😻🤭
What the shit people they are
She is the real star✌️
This just goes to show how some people are still uneducated and their ignorance in this day and age..wish you all the best of luck and good wishes...🇬🇧
Before releasing this moovie I would like to watch it , but after seeing her in JNU I changed my view about Dipika. She has no sympathy with Laxmi Agrawal, she only  wants to earn money .
See when any person will see an acid attack survivor it will send down chill down the spine. And it would take a moment to recover. I believe it was more a feeling of getting scared than anything else.<br>Though no hiding the fact that the Indian society does discriminate on the basis of looks.<br>But then these Bollywood stars themselves sell gora hone ka fair lovel products.<br>Stop selling fairness cream as first step of fighting discrimination on the basis of looks
Great job deepika mam🙏🙏🙏
Salute
Hi guys I want to say something .. Tanhaji is released with Chappak ... I have seen that most people&#39;s are disrespecting Chappak to promote Tanhaji .both films are different guys I watched both and both films are great ...plz don&#39;t write or post bad about chappak just show Tanhaji more good
This is reality of people. Its a great movie great experience with great cause everyone should watch it
I disliked 👎this video bcoz of only those people who made strange faces after seeing the Victims.
Useless society 100 years after no body no bones this society<br><br>All of you
good work  mam🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🙏
Hate those people who act rudely ..after all acid attack survivors r humans only
whats their reaction when they came to know its deepika
Some people&#39;s mentality is too bad in our India😞
Mujhe accha laga depeeka tumne thodi si b bina narvouse k apne aap ko ithna samajhke Jo kits shayad koi nahi karte rly aap aur ranveer bahut acche ho n....my fvrt hero ran
Love you deepu
Realty of today&#39;s world
The worst people are the ones that treat them like aliens ..they show no mercy,support or kindness.
We all should see chapaak
CHHAPAK  sound a grt pain <br>MUST MK IT social  awareness 😭
Aapki soch achhi hai
I love u deepika

I really love this movie ❤
They missed the chance to meet Deepika
worst acting by deeps
The narrow minded people ! <br>Shame on you all !
Im glad to born in sri lanka we dont have such a cruel ppl
Log o ko asa nhi KRNA chahiye tha... Yrr would bhi insaan hain... Deepika ma&#39;am thanks ki aap assa ek film banaye.... Aur good work team... People need to understand that we should respect them and not to hate them.... Again very good work Deepika ma&#39;am and team....

Wah india 😭😭
I hope this movie helps to change the mentality of atleast 1 people so that a girl can be saved from acid attack or other molestation
I think people are not disgusted they just feel bad for other other person and feel empathy towards them.Would you not be taken back with sudden appearance of such a victim?its not that you hate them its just naural reaction anyways we should embrace these girls and show them that to be human is more than jist your physical looks.People are people no matter thr circumstances.
I don&#39;t know how will I react on those situations.. But I am happy that few of them including those aunties were helping them 😘😘😘😘
I dont think they r reacting bad or cheap..they r just looking normally..how they look others..y this cameraman and sound person..showing it like ekta kapoor serial shocking scenes..
Love you Deepika.. 😘😘 you are not just a successful actress but a Better human being.. You are much more beautiful by your heart.. 🤗
Camera loaded 10 kilo over drama
Yes!. We must condemn acid attacks and call for strict punishments. Even threatening of acid attack must be an non bailable offense
Honestly, most of the looks did not appear as anything disrespectful. The video is trying portray something not happened. The people were not bad. Lets be honest.<br><br>.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=156">2:36</a> what&#39;s the woman doing to his son🙄🙄 No humanity shame on you people 🥺😶
This might sound offensive but actually i don&#39;t think most people in the video were really giving them disgust looks. I think most of them were just curious bcoz you don&#39;t see an acid attack survivor every day. It not normal and generally humans are curious  about abnormal things or people.<br>The editors really made most of them look bad with his dramatic music and editing.<br>Btw, these fighters have my utmost respect. And i truly hope that no one has to suffer what these brave girls have suffered in their life.
Deepika mam very kind of you.... love you a lot mam......
Wow!!!!!! I feel a little ashamed now to be in this society....
I likeD u UNTIL u stood beside traitors, anti nationals.. No more of u/ur movies.. U r diso, disappointing deepika
भाई डर सा लगता है इनको देखने पर चाये कोई भी ओ लोग भी कोई गलत नही है सायद मेरा भी reaction same Hota
Yaar aise to nazar chlo jaati h please man come on
Deepika you are great
To all those people who look at people with difficulties as like they&#39;ve never seen before a human. They should realise that if the same thing would have happened to them , the whole society would have ignored just the same way they are ignoring. Shame to those people who think that some touch can create disgrace , society needs to know the basic values and help others. Understand them and try to help them . Thank you for reading this.
We are conditioned to one thing. We would react the same if we were not aware of things. Movies like these, change the perspective.  Thank Deepika for it.
This is The saddest thing about peoples mentality that when they feel someone is quite different form others in any case of appearance and look then they ask for photographhs or prefer to take pictures secretly,gossip and stare at those people but  whens it comes for good purpose they don&#39;t even call for a ambulance and prefers to keep recording videos..most of the times i don&#39;t look at someone and even if i do accidently then i pretend not to see that person because i know he/she will feel uncomfortable us staring at them but i better prefer to smile at them and talk to them if no one is doing that.
I will boycott this movie not to support acid attackers but to not support Deepika..
Everyone should support this movie..
This is how many people thought deepika was another person<br> 👇🏻
Speechless
Yes we are with you....if our society accept murderers , criminals , rapiests ...why they are not..they are also a human being and I am just to cry when people reacting badly😭
बहुत ही अच्छा movie hy mam
Wow a very inspirational message for society
Hats of to u deepika padukone and chhappak team 👏👏👏👏
Hate deepika
Koi results nahi milta aisi ek koshish se, shayad hume society me isi tarah jina sikhaya jata hai . Ex- galti kisi ki bhugtaan kisi begunah ko karna hota hai
filmo ke etihas me tum aamar ho gai dipika🌹🌷
Bhkt log real life me b inko bycott kr rhe h wahh kya nichta h inki nfrto ki
Ye thik tha jnu gayi ab pura najriya badal geya
Great video
Deepika was looking so ugly in chapaak. This is why it flopped. People want glamor.
BE REAL THEN NAZRIYA BADLO
SHAME ON DEEPIKA FOR GOING TO JNU JUST FOR <a href="http://promotion.you/">PROMOTION.YOU</a> DIDN&#39;T GO THERE BECAUSE YOU FELT FOR THE STUDENTS! BE REAL!
SHAME ON CHAPAK TEAM FOR SENSATIONALIZING REACTION OF PPL
Very bad pr campaign CHAPAK team.they were not making faces!
Nazariya needed to be changed <br>Hats off 👏👏👏👏
Really sad to see soceity how they react towards the victim who have under gone acid attack
Shame on the ones who do dis kind of things (rapist) and biggest shame on those who treat the survivors disrespectfuly
Sory sory sory.. Me react this type sorry
Wow u deserve more respect from all industry seriously down to earth
Brilliant experiment. Well done.
nice attempt
Kuch log o ka face ka reaction itna ganda tha dil kiya unke mu k samne ja kar &quot;aaa thu&quot; kahu
Nice Deepika good job
This shows the cheap mentality of people
We can speak good with them instead of avoiding and showing faces. What they want is to be treated like a normal man. But adding sympathy to whatever they do, might make them aswell others petrified, clueless and helpless
Just acting, all the people are not like that.
Its easy to blame these people. <br>But many of us would have behaved in same manner . Because we have this annonying behaivour towards unsymmetrical things.
Dekho yar sau baat ki ek baat india mei hmesha auratein victim victim krti hai.dekho in ladies ko video mei.they should throw acid on themselves n die.itna cheap.aur yar dusro ke lie kya bolu.mai toh khud aise react krti.i feel ashamed n cheap
Heartbreaking ❤️
Nice promotion
wow u are great deepi phli Bollywood Queen jisne khud  <br>aam jnta k bic y kr k dikhaya or logo ki soch drsai
Actually it&#39;s not that people felt disgusted to see them. It&#39;s just that they got a shock, it&#39;s not on a daily basis that u see an acid attacked victim. So it takes some time for your mind to register.some did behave badly, but most of them were shocked
Well done Deepika mam. that&#39;s why I like Deepika 😘😘
Look at the ignorant ppl from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=78">1:18</a>......how bad
I support
I went to see Chhapaak with my mother. She doesn&#39;t follow social media so she had no idea about the concept of movie. When i told her it is Deepika Padukone...she didn&#39;t believe. She later told me if I had not told her...she never would have identified.<br>Kudos to you and your make-up team.
SOME PEOPLE THAT NEVER CHANGE  WE SHOULD RESPECT THEM
great....amazing 👍👌
Felt so bad...log aise kiu behave karte hai yar...duniya mei koobsurat hona istna zaruri  hai...inka haak hai k wo jiya jaise chahe wo ji sakte...just 1 word for u deepika thank u🙏

People in the society are not giving weird looks because they are afraid or don&#39;t want to see these people but they are afraid of those bastards who have done this. I am sorry to say but even I don&#39;t know how I perceive these people      <br>but now I am going to prepare myself in the better way possible.
Deepika padukone your and victim your family also reacts in same way....
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=83">1:23</a> this women&#39;s reaction is disgusting ya...she thinks that she will never get old and ugly in her life..poor lady 😒😣
Gandu humne dekha tera chahra jnu me
They hired someone from Indian Soap opera and News channels to edit this video.
Fake woman
Its a normal reaction.. Bcz, when we see something different,we look into it. Sometimes with anxiety or fear.. Cant blame that people.. Its only a reflex reaction.

Making story, nt an incident....<br>Bt still our society is very vulgarity
Getting a little shocked the moment we see them. Or keep staring at them for few seconds. Yeah I would do that. But not helping them, changing my face reaction, moving away from them, judging them. I&#39;ll never do that Even before the movie came.
What was wrong in this,<br>They were just looking at the girls, i didn&#39;t see anything akward in this.
एसिड अटैक होने के बाद सुलझा हुआ चेहरा देख कर के लोगों के मन में क्या खयालात आते हैं तथा लोगों के कैसे हावभाव रहते हैं <br> जरा सोचिए उस लड़की के बारे में वह कितना कुछ झेलती हैं अपनी जिंदगी में एसिड अटैक होने के बाद
Imagine realizing that you were in the video... 😶
I deeply  feel bad for the girl that was attacked by acid. But deepika n team is only doing fr film promotion. These all r scripted .like going to jnu,crying infront of cam <a href="http://etc.as/">etc.As</a> a whole this film industry people hv no emotion only they think of MONEY  n nothing.
boycott chappak in theatres and watch in movierulz so,that we can shut Deepika mouth

Very sad
All credit goes to deepika mam ko milna chahiye
If the celebs Eve take off their make up and act natural like in Hollywood movies that&#39;s enough.
A-Attack victims ka mazak bana rahka hai paise kamaane ke liye.... just shame on you deepika paad-kone-me...
Still a long way to go for experiencing equality in real sense.... Just breaks my heart to see their behavior, the way they were looking at them, ignored them.... Proves why other countries are so developed than ours... Development starts with mentality!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23supportchappak">#supportchappak</a>
Khud Deepika ne movie shooting ke baad us mask Jo ki unka make up tha unhone feke diya tha ya jala diya tha,to unko khud bhi apna najriya change krne ki jarurt hai.aur konsi baat midea me btana hai aur konsi nhi ye bhi unko sochna chahiye.general human being me kisi bhi thing Jo aankho ko achi na lage uska expression yhi hota hai chahe wo koi chij ho ya koi insaan ho,hum kisi ke sath raherker hi uska behavior judge Kar skte na kii Surat se isly comman people ka expression asa hi hoga.okkey Deepika ji ye mere khud ke views hai.please isse personal na le.okey.
How did she done the makeup pls show us
Asal​ may​ in​ kay​ charay aina​ ki​ tarah​ logo ko​ in​ may​ apni​ badsorti nazar​ ati​ hai​ or​ apna​ badsorat chahra dekhna​ koi​ pasand nahi​ karta
In my opinion she is only promoting her movie it will be interesting to see after the movie then how much she support this cause with so heartfully as she is
I feel so bad for all those that are acid servivers but after reading about everything I wanna say you All are pretty and bravest in this world you guys face these challenges everyday and those acid attackers deserve the worlds worst punishment i am really proud that Deepika is standing with them and I can&#39;t wait to see this movie I have been so excited for weeks and I&#39;ve told all my friends to watch it to way to go Deepika
Double standards actors
Iski movie ko boycott krna chahiye  <br>Is desh se hi earn krange ur ise hi gaali dange
Boycott chaapak😂😂 I don&#39;t know Deepika Padukone.  She doesn&#39;t know me..
OMG Mai same day apni girlfriend ke sth bhr tha mujhe ky pta dipika ji...bullshit yrrrr....😫😫😫
Every thing is fine, but i think  you should not have join the JNU tukde tukde
Lvu all 😘
Ye video scripted hai movie promotion k liye....
https://youtu.be/ntY-21vnMZg<br>please
Kya kuch or video shoot nahi kiya.... Or samaj janni h logo ki...
Love you Deepu. <br>U r sach a co 🌟 😘😘😘😘😘
This looks scripted. And the background music further sensationalizes reactions which are even normal.
Respect Laxmi Agarwal 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😠
👍👍👍👍👍👍
All my love and prayers to those who suffered... But these bollywood celebrities and community has no right to do these social experiments... These people are hypocritical, narrow minded and self centred... these are the same people advertise for beauty brands and now wants to give message... Sit and talk with all those people you ideots... I am sure 99% of them are good...
I remember, when I had a lot of acne and scars , people made absolutely yucky faces wherever I went. The sad truth is we deal with hate on everyday basis due to skin colour, height, weight, clothes, appearance etc. Chhapaak is not just a movie but a movement seeking for change in perspective. Thanks dear Deepika, Meghna and everyone associated for such awesome piece of art.
Last me jab ek aunty apne bete ki mu dhak raha tha na......sala itna gussa aaya.......
Deepika lovers <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh_fa2bexYs">https://youtu.be/Qh_fa2bexYs</a>
Huge respect for Deepika!! It&#39;s time people to remove the acid from your own brains..! Her film will flourish and do wonders in every sensible person&#39;s heart who watches it..
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
To be honest as a transgender person i am well aware of such strong reactions from people..and it is a challenge to go out in the public without getting harrased or starred at or mocked...there is no fault of acid survivors yet some people make them feel unwelcomed and non existing.
Deepika ❤❤❤
Woww what a way to slap those who did 🙌 depikaa you are great 😊
At some point I felt <br>That the editting dhangdhang sound was not required..<br>Some people just gave a normal look..<br>But some were avoiding them
Shameless people..😠😠😠😠😠😠
Did sharukh khan, salman khan, amir khan romanced with unfair and black girl in the movie? they want foreign heroines with best figure and white and fair skin. many unfair people in India living happily <br>Did deepika came into movies with unfair skin? did deepika not promote beauty products?<br>these videos are financed to promote  their movie to lure audience. please dont believe in movie heros and heroins. they have been ruining society with showing  bad culture in movies.<br>Common people are leading their life responsibly.
1.2k dislike bhaqt ne hi kiye honge 😀😀
When i first saw this title I really didn&#39;t expect that kind of reaction what&#39;s worng with them what if it&#39;s happened to their on loved ones will their reaction still be the same...? Shame on them a person&#39;s beauty is not from out side those people are ugly who don&#39;t respect because their judgment is upon how is someone look like...?<br>Proud of you Deepu &amp; the whole team...i love ❤️you<br>We all are same...<br>we all are humans...
A huge Bravo  to Megha Deepika n team🙏🙏🙏
Superb mam I am very proud
i un followed her on jnu visit. you also do the same.
Some ppl are really shitty to give such disgust looks<br>But some of them are just looking thats normal, if u see something unusual then u would give it a second look <br>Need not to put that dramatic sound every fucking time
They are not even look at her. The actress and her team had made it look like as if they were. They all were minding their own business. This video is way too cringy. No doubt the message behind it is good, but don’t try to push it down our throat.
अफसोस
So painful to see how people reacted
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Idk if its publicity or what..but what they did is something for which they shd be appreciated
How can you confirm that people saw these women as untouchables? Anything can be done by editing... Get ready for someone suing you for showing them in the bad light.... Worst marketing ever.. this is not gonna help your movie
Idk why people are behaving so rude.They are also humans .There&#39;s no point of behaving like this😕.Rip humanity.They should be ashamed of themselves.
Ha Sacha batt he
Add
I regret my action
These all are publicity gimmicks, dont get fooled, the public too are actors. Boycott Chaapak
Jinka koi kasur nahi unse log muh jab morte h  .tab samaj ke soch ka pata chalta h.

When Its a real story why to change name and religion of the attacker ?? Show the way it has happened !
Salute u dipu god bless you
Deepika podukane I actually see this video I really shocked what expression about the people   <br>I have to say something about all those people whose expression very worst  <br>The natural beauty is comes from inner beauty
Mai ye video dekh kr bahut emotional ho gyi I mean kitna jyada painful hota hai ye sb survive krna public ko face krna log darawni gandi buri nazar se dekhte hein jaise victim insaan nhi hai.
Great mam miru
I would look at them too, if they passed by me. That doesn&#39;t mean I have an ill will against them.
A prank in need is a prank indeed 🤗🤦
I would suggest that you should show this video before starting the movie in hall. At least people will see themselves how they look when they react please
Love you Dipika

Kanahiya ne to jnu me deepika ko pehchanane se inkar kar dia..😂😂<br>I dun think she really deserves malti ji&#39;s role. For malti ji huge respect..but for deepika👎👎👎👎<br>She can do anything for publicity..
Isn&#39;t it <b>Objectifying</b> by taking a selfie with that lady without knowing who/what is she ?<br>.<br>No one in the comment section considered this. Comment section People are glorifying whoever is taking a selfie with them.<br>.<br>To those Selfists:- How can you be so sure that they are Acid attack survivors? (anyone may get such face like natural defect or some accident or attack which need not to be considered as Acid Attack)<br>.<br>.<br>Just saying 🙏🙏
I think it&#39;s because ppl saw Deepika that they were surprised rather than the burn marks
Omg 1.1k dislikes!!!!ohh God humanity guys!!!
What an experiment    .. 🙃🙃    nadim khan to  rajesh 😂😂... Secularism???????
Malti ke bahut Chhoti clip hai or Essase Bada clip video nahi hai
Good Job Whole All Team Chhapaak God bless you to all entire Family Chaaapak  Pleasure Welcome Malti Hamare Desh ki padmavati Welcome leela Welcome pink
Welcome Malti Swagatam Brave Girl Women&#39;s Power Our Guider
Welcome Chhapaak
Really its movie is the evergreen message to all peoples be awareness and be help each other its movie is the top film in the world
Beauty lies in the eyes of observer
Bravo ...👍👍<br><br>सोच बदलो , देश बदलेगा ...
To all the people getting offended by people looking down upon the acid attack victims - Stop being so fake. Most of you would have done the same . It&#39;s harsh, but it&#39;s the truth of our society!
All I see was a clever editing where people are portrayed  as cruel...Shame on u guys for using those survivors(fighters) in the name of social experiment for your b********t business/promotion...They aren&#39;t invisible ...and yes people see them...are u ppl suggesting that no one should see them..then how is that gonna make them normal..wanna give them respect??..then how about treating them NORMAL ..instead of creating a scene out of it...THIS ISNT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SOCIETY OR THOSE VICTIMS...ITS JUST TO FILL YOUR POCKETS..ITS ALL THAT YOU CARE .. IT&#39;S JUST A BUSINESS FOR U GUYS

I&#39;ve a second thought to this..i reckon our brain is prone to distorted images so first time reaction shouldnt be counted.<br>Though totally against the discrimination they have to face for no fault of theirs.

Actually I cried while watching it...😭
Deepika ka picture koi dheaka mat sali promotion ke liye pata nhi kya kya kr raahi hai ..😠😠
I dont like
Nice
We are going to watch this movie...and it&#39;s a very positive side of movies...one should make...appreciate and watch too...NAZARIYA BADLEGA...BADALNA BHI CHAHIYEAH
Why this sensationalism? If I see someone a bit different, I&#39;ll look twice. Some people were a bit off, that&#39;s understandable, but should we just not look even normally? What are we supposed to do, gouge our eyes out?<br><br>P.S. - Nothing against the survivors of the crime.
Many people are just looking. No  disgust or anything. Just looking.<br>But yes we can be more acomodative and helpful.
It&#39;s not completely hatred or aversion. As much as we read and appreciate the survival stories of acid attack victims,i have not encountered them in public except for very few instances. If you observe the lady at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=73">1:13</a>, she&#39;s taken aback for just a second and then realises that she&#39;s a victim. Same happened to me once and it took a few seconds until i understood her plight. But what really depressed me was that in those few seconds when she encountered my blank stare,i could see her helpless condition,the embarrassment that she faces daily,and the countless pair of eyes watching her from all directions. I could feel her pain.<br>I feel that we&#39;re all responsible for the pain she have endured. And the least thing we can do is to appreciate the brave women who  refuses to surrender to a society of hypocrites.
aap ne kitna badla dipika g... pls tell me ...siraf movie tak he uske age.....?
Yes...show them the mirror...how stupid the look when they stare a girl having scars on her face
U dont have to do make up.... Just go like that, u won&#39;t be recognized... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycotchappak">#boycotchappak</a>
Nonsense and judgemental<br>If someone gives even a regular look, just bcoz they looked at an acid attackd face, they were portrayed as inappropriate. They may be looking at others too in sameway. Also, some ppl expressions are same as when see someone strange looking, doesn&#39;t mean reacting as an ugly looking.
Editing ke zhada hi hogaya
Listen you idiots , sone times the thoughts in peoples mind is that of empathy. People want to know the story, want to embrace them with love but at the same time dont want to make people uncomfortable. You wanted to direct it in a way that people are wrong and you achieved it. Well played for the promotion of the movie. Shaming people randomly. You dont know the back story of these people. What do you think , they will randomly come and hug or ask for selfie. Bollywood has shown ki promotion k liye kuch bhi karenge

We humans are easy to fool, we have to learn how to look beyond what the camera show us.<br><br>I accept the fact that people look at acid attack survivors weirdly, but in this video not everyone who is looking at them is looking in a bad way. Humans give same facial expressions to many things which might mean opposite to reach other.

You watch sadhana TV channel pe satsang suno 7:30 pm pe. Duniya se achha anubhav Aana nahi he. Kyunki duniya me apki kadra vahi karega Jo dudh se jala he . kyunki we chhach ko bhi fuk marke pite he. Didi ye duniya swarth se bhari he.
I never see this movie because dipika support tukre tukre gang.

Some of them were treating them normally. Some were hesitant and some outright tried to ignore them.

If I would see someone like that then I would ignore her and act normal and treat her like we treat others I mean i will not keep on staring at her and if they ask for any help i will give them like we give help to others.

This is our great indian people&#39;s <br>Cheap Mentalities.
When people look at them for one second you dont have to make it look so bad dramatically. They might have just glimpsed for a moment and editors paused the frame and <b>*dramatic music black and white*</b> Seriously?!!! You might be making good people look bad. If I see special people in any manner, I usualy try to look square in their face and give a friendly smile. Everyone should too..
Movie se bada hamara desh h..
No not only acid attack survivors... People stare the same way...infact way worse than this to..vitiligo patients also... Especially when someone is having patches on their face..infact they sometime ask their companion too...to turn and look...this is so ridiculous
Best movie bhi yahi rahegi 2020 ki Dil se keh raha hoon.aur haan najariyan badalna bhi jaruri h.

Boycott depika movie...jnu m ja kr desh ko todne walo ko support karti h..shemm
It&#39;s shocking to see that youngsters and especially the girls are seeing  them awfully. Atleast these girls should have respect and empathy for them.
Dipika Ek number ki audail lagti he bhosei ki original he o assi he use ...
It&#39;s time to change.....
I watched the video thrice and came to this conclusion.<br>People were not discriminating them but they were just looking like as if they were aliens.<br>People might be feeling sad for them in their hearts. Who knows!? <br><br>But I believe this movie will make society accept them as normal people.
Boycott deepika movie
Boycott dipika movie
ईनसान बनना होगा हर ईसान को
Very Heart Breaking
all scripted
If you see someone  burnt or disfigured it took us a moment to get used to it .they aren&#39;t necessarily  bad . some people are just curious or shock
Good experiment Deepika mam
My heart cries when I see the suffered suffer more,,.
Logo ko aisa nahi karane chahiye <br>Ubhi to insan hai <br>Logoko najaria badala hoga 😡😡👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I wish wo log jinhone aise expression diya ab iye video dekh rhe hai... Meme banane wale aise logon ko leke meme banao jo insaan ko insaano ki najar se nahi dekhte hai... Let&#39;s make this video viral
I wish this video would reach more than 500 millions views, so it reaches most of the people of India.<br>Please understand, they&#39;re not victims, they&#39;re survivors.
Being humans ....we get afraid when we saw unnatural things ...that is wt happen there too ....but being a HUMAN  we should set that one within second n we have to shw our concern towards n we should encourage those people who are punished without their concern to grow in their lifes...........<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23seturmindnow">#SetURMindNow</a>....

And it shows that dipeeka has 0% attitude....  that is why i love her 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
समाज दिन ब दिन बहुत घटिया मानसिकता में ढलता जा रहा है😡
Iski film ka boycott kroo sabhi hindu bhai isne unn jnu vaalo ka saath diya kuto ka 😠😠😠😠
It&#39;s painful...acidsurvivors sbki help krri h ,lekin unki dusre log nhi...agr unke khud ke bccho k sath esa kuch hota h to unhe feel hoga,lekin dusro ka pain smjhna nhi chahte....soch badalni jaruri h👍👍
What i think is the aim of the video was good but the think is some people don&#39;t see these types of things everyday so they will definitely not try to see but it doesn&#39;t means that they have that negative thought for them...i will also hesitate at first coz acid just screw your face but everyone intention is not the same....deepika should not just expose them that&#39;s not the right way
Good job
Why that people were seeing like that they never seen a human 😡
Deepikaji u go to JNU...
People often preach about how beauty is skin deep and such but when they come across anyone with even a slight difference in physical features (for e.g. skin colour let alone the features caused by genetic conditions or external factors) that&#39;s when one gets to see their hypocrisy.
कसम से नज़रिया बदलने की ज़रूरत है<br>आंख में आँसू आ गए।<br>इंसानियत तो लगभग खत्म ही हो गयी है।<br>दीपिका जी और टीम को सधन्यवाद🙏🙏
Nautanki
It&#39;s a good move deepika . ..firstly god bless for taking up on subjects which others will never fathom.  And may be thus has changed or triggered something in you ..led you to stand up against violence if all types ..seeing you empathise with students ..something that India needs today.. Empathy not violence..
Boycott chappak movie because of j.n.u attendance
I feel, this movie is definitely going to aware masses and masses. Good move for betterment of society. 👍

That&#39;s the natural and normal reaction of any human being! Stop over dramatising it! 🙄🙄🙄 People get shocked and they should because it is shocking and painful what happened to them! Should we be desensitized to it??

Just for movies they show how they are concerned with the acid attack victims ony for promotions just after movies success they forget them ,emotionaly fool us to buy tickets , really want to do something then announce you will donate all the movies income on acid attack victims , then I will guaranty you we will watch movie two times 🙂
Yes ... Nazriya badalna zaroori hai..ameer gareeb se bhi.nice msg guys.
Y they are reacting like that ,they humans not monsters ,they became like this by  idot monsters ,y people treat them like this , great respect 🙏🏻 🙏🏻 for this girls who live between this type people sorry monsters
I appreciate the video but not hiding the faces of those people was something unethical as well, for the sake of the movie making such video &amp; showing their faces as they have done any crime is also something people should talk about!! Although the message is quiet clear &amp; informative too.
One of the best video I have ever seen. .......
Rona aa gya yaar
I must be honest to my heart , I will react shocked and hesitate but I don&#39;t misbehave with them.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=27">0:27</a> are you sure it&#39;s a &quot;Hidden Camera &quot; ? Lmao

Why don’t u show the culprit name and religion in this movie I understand it’s bcse of fear towards them and u r gng to support and share the stage with bloody antinationals for ur movie promotion shame Deepika

Deepika is just promoting her film like JNU
Editer gets full marks 💯💯
Size of hidden camera 😅
Sry tumhari nhi dekh sakta...Ur deshdrohiii... Dipika
The people acted normally towards them, why the video makers are adding black and special affects to the video, where is the normal video? As a depth video watcher i myself think that the reactions were normal as they were only  seeing them and they would do this even for any physically disabled person which is normal. The lady refused to wear  the dress is correct as why would she change her dress infront of public which is a normal reaction to any normal person. The video should have made correctly like a in &quot;What would you do show?&quot;
I oppose chappak
Main ke bhi chehre par nahi jaa raha balki dipika padukon ko dislike kiya hai
Good film
Tujhe main dislike deta hoon 1 nahi crore ki tadat mein
Pretty faces are everywhere...but pretty soul is hard to fine
Goosebumping,Heart breaking... <br>Hard to see how people are reacting..... Its INDIA..
I feel sad 😌🙊👏🏻 for those peoples who think they are normal<br>And these are abnormal<br>Acid attacker <br>Rapist<br>Eve teasers<br>All are free<br>And these victums treated as criminals<br>How idiot we are
my choice
Before jumping to any conclusion, understand that the editor of this video added all those shitty visual and sound effects to enhance people&#39;s reaction. Ofcourse, there may have been people who keeps staring in an irritating manner in reality. But majority of the people in this video behaved normally and those effects make us think they behaved badly.
Chutiya Giri hain yay picture bilkul support nahi hai hamara isay. Isay dislike Kiya hain humnay. Chutiya log sirf sympathy chahiyay tumhayay. Sacchayi tho dikhata nahi.<br>Bhai log dislike karo iskayw trailer Ko.<br>🤬🤬🤬🤬

Those are hidden cameras😂 nd lemme tell u people in india people worship film stars u put whatever mask on thier faces ..people will recognize them no matter what.. this was just an publicity stunt ..just like deepika reaching to jnu ...kuch farak ni pdhta inn logo ko
Boycott
I request and support Laxmi ji... Bt Deepika boycott movie...
What does it take to help others? To give someone a hug?
Wrong decision of supporting left
I m agree with you
Firstly you are supposed to pixelate those faces , secondly they were not even looking at the acid attack survivors , but still those unnecessary sound effects as if they were really treating them bad, thirdly, it&#39;s almost sure that no one is gonna try a cloth on the road just because some stranger asks them to, be it an acid attack survivor or a normal person .
Ye jitne log ganda sa muh bnaye hai ab ye khud se nazar kaise milayenge, jab ye khud ko beizzat hote dekhenge, kharab ye survivor nhi samaj ko nazar hai
Humara samaj me dil nhj rup dekkha jatah.insanneyat to h hi nhi
An elephant can hide behind those hidden cameras
😘😘😘😍😍😍😘😘
<b>She&#39;s just normal</b> 👍😃
Btw I didn&#39;t see anything wrong with any of the reactions. The thing is the editors didn&#39;t find anything wrong. Thus had to do shittttttyyy editing to make it look like wrong. Even in the end, the woman covered her son&#39;s mouth to prevent him from saying anything disrespectful to the girl.

Lol Deepika is the one who is standing with jnu students ...... She also wants to break India . Double standard gal...... Tukde tukde gang ka support karti hai yeh ......
If they thinks and react acid attacker&#39;s are ugly then let em think coz they might buetifull from out side but they descusting and ugly from inside and the real butty comes from heart not from face I&#39;m also ugly but i never think anything wrong for someone so i feel I&#39;m a good in me^^

😍😍😍😍😍😍
Yaar if something bad has happened to the girls people will definitely at least look, it&#39;s wired into the brain to figure out and be attentive on any signs of threat please keep in mind ANY! Be it Post or Pre. <br>Also if a random stranger asks me that this is a better vegetable take that one is it necessary for me to accept it? You find your own and let me find mine. Pls what is wrong with that?<br>People look at anything that looks a little out of the way in public, it&#39;s just people. Both sides need to ignore each other also accept what they both will do unintentionally. Don&#39;t go all too dramatic about something that Is autonomous.
Is tatti ki movie ab nahi dekhni ja kar unhi jnu valon ko dikhale
Acne in my face makes people around me Doctors and these girls r warrior&#39;s...! Having acne is seen as such heinous crime..! people need to change their outlook on beauty.. spotless and perfect beauty is not what &quot;being pretty&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot; means.. it&#39;s your courage and charisma that defines beauty.. evry human being who has a pure heart should have the right to be called &quot;Beautiful&quot;..
I boycott your movie.....if you support tukde tukde gang....
Kitna bhi social experiment wagera kr lo kuch change nehi hoga ....kutte ka dum kabhi seedha nehi hota ......u gotta be accept this and keep moving on ......this is the bitter truth ..😔😔😔

I don&#39;t blame the public. Their faces are misshapen and deformed. Surely a normal person would feel revolted by taking a look at their faces. It is normal human nature.
This is hypocrisy around us, movie sad dekhne Jayenge. But when it comes to public acceptance or welcoming people around us, it’s a far away thing in India. Sad but true
Waste people

Good topic will Deepika give the earned money to the girl .with sensitive topics these actor&#39;s earned millions and will .

Ye koi badi Baat nahi hai har insan ka yehi reaction hoga chahe wo koi bhi ho
Very bad...just for your movie publicity using these citizens and showing them in bad light 😡
I think we are not physically but mentally in the video, if this happened to us , 90% of the people in the comment section will react the same way, <br>Don&#39;t try to be good from outside<br>Be good from your heart ❤️

and you know how the movie will going to be.
Boycott this movie
Love the concept!!However it feels the video is given a little more hindi daily soap touch to make it more interesting. While it&#39;s basic human nature when you see something different from everyday you look at them with a surprise before realizing you have been looking at them way long to make them uncomfortable. Be it a normal lady in a short skirt too. Some of the people werre outright evil and some scared which is what I call lack of awareness but few reactions were not evil but what I define as not understanding how to react which has been portrayed with extra masala maybe. Normalizing the differences that exist in the society is must and it&#39;s not easy in countries like india where old values are ingrained in people&#39;s mind. We must keep trying though. Cheers for the team and wish you best of luck.

Proud of you Deepika
Promotion k liye kuch v ..
I see such face ,I see physically disabled I am mentally retirted so what should I expect people to love me oh come on everyone get what they get this society drama and all
The problem is you enforcing extra effort to make it look normal when it&#39;s not ,people in Bollywood are really opportunist that makes them excellent human all greats are opportunist it&#39;s my lack of being the one who could grasp such opportunist mindset
I hope Deepika will show her responsibility always , not only for her film promotion.
सारा मामला ही उल्टा है ,<br>जिनको बुरी नजर से देखना चाहिए ,वो लड़के पता नही कहाँ हैं,<br>जिनकी गलती ही नही है ,उनको लोग अजीब नजर से देख रहे हैं। <br><br>उन लड़कों के साथ ऐसा होना चाहिए कि जहाँ जाए लोग उनको बुरी नजर से देखें ,फि उन लड़कों को अपने किये पर पछतावा हो, उनको देख कर बाकी लोगों का दिमाग ठिकाने आये।
See her new face <a href="https://twitter.com/erbmjha/status/1214632947812188160?s=19">https://twitter.com/erbmjha/status/1214632947812188160?s=19</a>
Mujhe lagta hai <br>Logo ko apni soch se ladna chaheye, ek aacha nazariya hona chaheye.
Honestly, I didn&#39;t feel anything wrong with most of the glances. I would also atleast twice looked at them n then got back to my work. What&#39;s the big deal with this video. However, in real life such discriminations do exist.

I dont understand what&#39;s problem with Bollywood. Sare Bollywood ko society ke soch se problem hai. Inko lagta hai hum sab chutiye hai. Humare pass dil hi nahi hai. Hum resist hai. Normal log ekdusre ka khun karte hai. <br>Kisine bhi itna dark reaction nahi diya. Jitni Editor ne music Dali.   <br>Miss deepika tum apni soch badlo. Aur hypocrisy chhod do. Khud skin whitening ki creams bechti hai. Aur hume bolti hai soch badlo. Sara hindustan pyar se rehta hai tum Bollywood wali kehi gand me kida hai. Even tollywood bhi itna torchar  nahi karta.
Promotion or not, it warmed my heart. <br>All of that may not be aversion. Its normal human tendency to be shocked, at least a bit when you look at something that your eyes dont come across everyday. <br>Having said that, this video did make me put myself there and empathise the scenario. <br>Great job!
Nice job by deepika

I think sabse kharab tab laga jab us lady ne apne bachhe ke face pe apna hand rakha .<br>Kya galti hai ladkiyon ki .<br>Jab ek mahila khud  kisi mahila ki respect  nahi karegi to phir hamara samaj kaise badal sakta hai
Maximum girls criticised them
Good mess for each and every one
Mim too good
Ye to proof ho hi gya girls girls se hi nafrat karti hai after all

Very bad
What&#39;s in the world make those camera hidden?
Well done Deepika mam<br>You have a done a wonderful job
All the dislikers... should go to hell
Iss video ko dekhne se phle shayad mai bhi ignore kr deta but now i am ashamed😔😔😔
Someone tell me<br>What she was doing today in jnu<br>With kanhayiya kumar....and tukde tukde gang.....<br>Gadaar sali
Ye log promotion ke liye kuch bi karege. Jese aaj Deepika promotion ke chakar m JNU m desh virodhi naare lagne par bi chup kyu thi.. inko saari insaaniyat film promotion ke time hi yaad aati h.
Aur  kuch karna  chahiye apko promotion ke liye..😀😀
Kudos to such social exprmnt ..hope this chngs the mindset of ppl.. probably these are the last finishing touch we need to give to make the Mansion of New India 👌
Some stupid human are not feel his problem..
Abey itni hi chinta hai in logo ki<br>Aur itna social service ka drama kar rhi hai<br><br>To movie ke liye karodo me fees lene ki kya jarurat thi
Sometimes there are no words to describe something. I can only hope that one day perception of society will change towards the victims. And there will be a paradise in the world where girls will feel safe everytime.
Not interested
It&#39;s nice. Ppl will learn. But Its natures law. Eyes goes first on something that is different. This doesn&#39;t mean all are descriminating.  But kudh bhi to descrimination kar rahe ho. Last moment par sirf deepika ka bite liya baki ladkiyon ka suggestions kyun nahi liya. Aur aapka bollywood bhi toh descrimination karta hai writers, actors ke sath. Nepotism ka najariya kab badlega. Kab meri script ko production house kudh ijat de kar na sirf andar aane denge balki guards se lekar upar boss tak har koi strugling writers, or actors ko mauka denge. Kab writers ko director ke baad, hero-heroines se upar, sabse jayada payment milega.  Najariya bollywood ka bhi badalna chahiye. Bollywood ka najariya desh ke prati bhi badalna chahiye. Warna do group me na batta ye bollywood. Or Deepika mam itna hi aap insaan ho to jawo apni late night parties, or foriegne trip ke paise bacha kar mumbai ke slum ko  ek saaf surakshit ghar bana kar de do. Tab mai samjhunga  aap real hero hain. But still i salute you  for this role of acid attack. No credit taken away  best wishes. Jai
Jo log is video mein h aur jab yeh video dekhenge to khenge shit Deepika samne thi but we miss the chance to meet her. But truly it&#39;s very disheartening to see people reacting like this. Isme in girls ka kiya glti h. Glt to voh those did this henious and inhumane crime.
Film promotion ke liye itne log Kafi Thoda Hai Kanhaiya Kumar ko bhi sath mein le Leti aur thoda Janu chale jao Shant Na Dene Ke Liye
Anti Hindu
Itne dio se chapak film ka promo aa rha hai fir bhi deepika ko koi pehchan nhi paya

Well I don&#39;t know how people react to something that they are not familiar of, but they do have sympathy for those who suffered such accidents &amp; those who think that they should maintain distance or avoid these people should remember that &quot;दुर्घटना हमेशा दूसरों के साथ ही नहीं होती है&quot;. <br>One more thing that you are not bound to make them feel comfortable or good but at the same time you are not supposed to make them feel inferior or unfortunate.
It&#39;s not like that ......even i Don&#39;t have guts to look in their eyes , it&#39;s because i just want to close my eye so that i can&#39;t see the pain. I haven&#39;t watched your chhapak trailer completely , i had a headache seeing it , the pain i can&#39;t think of
See that girl at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVHneYYLxxE&amp;t=82">1:22</a> u soon start hating her
Boycott deepika<br>She supports <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tukde">#Tukde</a>_Tukde_Gang
Boycott deepika&#39;s movie because she suport JNU..kanhaia kumar......JAI HIND
बकवास फ़िल्म
Ye social experiment kisi ko  bura kahne ya bura mahsoos kara ne ke liye nhi kiya gya h ese kiya gya h ground reality dikhane ke liye. To  jaisa Deepika MAM ne kha ki - &quot;Hame Jarurat h to bas apna najariya badlne ki &quot;. ..... Well done👍 guys, kuch alag karke dikhane ke liye.
RESPECT.

Chhapak mai to nahi dekhunga. Padukon left se mili hai.
Acid attackers ek bar marte h lekin society bar bar marti h, sahi kaha tha, is society ki problem hi yahi h, inke hisab se chale to thik wrna sb galt ho rha h aur dor prte srko pe
some people just don&#39;t know how to react...just because of so many emotions, questions going through their mind...stop judging others just at the drop of a hat like that.
great job

What to say? Every time we will say INDIA won&#39;t change! Country never changes man PEOPLE living in India has to change n their mindset! Soch badhal na hai!

Those burn faces r beautiful than yours after jnu vist.....
I would have easily recognized Deepika
Itna badiya topic pr pitr banaee apna,, Sara Nash krdiya jnu ja kr matlab sirf aur sirf Paise ha ap log k liya,, 25000 hazar salary ha but humari life sachi aur achee ha apse
Thanks deepika
I was literally waiting for the moment deepika will show her real face  coz that would have taught them real lesson as sometimes things aren&#39;t the way we take it....

deepika this time u moved with a wrong strategy of joining assholes of jnu.. i hate u and your movies..
Kaise kutte log bhare hai India me
Well done dipika . I think we all have to change our thaught.. but what is your publicity budget is low that you support jnu student who support Pakistan and raise slogan free Kashmir etc .you never came forward  for army , policeman who are beaten by these rascals. Yes I support govt  when they pass NRC then I will support because it is our nation no rohingyas and Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims are allowed to live here and make our environment worse like Bollywood..
Female itself don&#39;t understand the other female, what to expect from male or others. Female should atleast understand the suffering of other females.
Please can someone please tell me how I&#39;m supposed to react<br>Because that is not how humans are born naturally<br>I&#39;ve never met a survivor in my entire life<br>How can u expect me to react normal ??
Chapak hogi dhapak qki isne kanhaiya Kumar ka le lia sapak

Nice film promotion tactic !
It&#39;s not a disease or something their face looks different that&#39;s it, we really lack awareness on such topics so this things keeps happening
