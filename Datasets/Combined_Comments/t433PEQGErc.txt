If there was an Oscar for best trailer ever made, this would win uncontested.
Don&#39;t wish to spoil anyone&#39;s mood with my personal life but if you ever had to take care of your mom you know this guy from bottom to top.
The film is actually good, but it&#39;s a shame, the actor playing Joker is too old, it&#39;s like watching a transvestite film
Parece a vida de alguém q vive em São Paulo.
Looking back, this trailer was better than  the movie itself...  Sorry to say this...
o maior trailer já feito
THIS is one of the best movie trailers ever made!! Yes the movie itself is very good, and with a phenomenal lead actor performance, but I don&#39;t say lightly that this trailer is truly gripping from start to finish, all the while elevating one&#39;s emotions until &quot;JOKER&quot; displays....ooo the feels!! Brilliant, simply brilliant💜
Been 4 years, huh ?
Watching this in the cinema Made me Feel Really sorry for the Joker<br>Only what he wanted was to bring joy to the world<br>And the world ignored him
Its not more relevant than ever before things were always like this.
Jokers are not laughing stock, they make everyone laugh, they live in people&#39;s hearts
100% понимания
this movie is a masterpiece, to the level of the first superman or even better.  This DC movie is way better than all marvel movies combined
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=45">0:45</a> song..?
I love how Warner Bro&#39;s made the joker in this movie an actual comedian hence his name. They made his iconic laugh his expression of intense sadness rather wickedness (which was the villainous characters of the previous jokers). So brilliant.
It&#39;s been almost 5 years and it still touches me.
I’d love if they did a Lex Luthor origin movie. Such a movie would also be perfect and make total sense.
Still the best trailer ever made.
Even though I watched it dubbed, the movie still hit hard. Really just on ordinary clown having enough of middleman walking trough claiming everything is his
I&#39;ve been still thinking about this guys as I am waiting for the sequel this October 4th of 2024 what if a &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; existed in this realm? My gosh that would be &quot;Sick!&quot; 😱
Remember: Joker 2 hits cinemas October 4th 💯
I love this so much
When White People become too lenient....things break down.
A powerful moral of treating people with respect at all times.
5 years later... Joker 2 comes out this March 🙌
Deus, eu quero os 15 pagando até o último centavo por 10 anos em dor e humilhação e depois expirando. Amém!
Masterpiece trailer
Finally got to watch the movie. Loved every minute!
I still come to rewatch this trailer, one of the best ever.
Hindi dubbed please

Does That Music Sounds Like Munich By John Williams?
At the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=101">1:41</a> part, you can clearly but faintly hear Godzilla&#39;s Showa roar as the trailer&#39;s background noise. Seems pretty obvious to me. 😮
4 years later and still a masterpiece. One of the greatest villain origin films of this generation.
A masterpiece: All we want to be is be ourselves
My life is exactly like the jokers but the mother story is different
Need in hindi language DC please
Need in hindi dubbed please warner bros
I lived a life like the Joker. But I don&#39;t agree with Joker&#39;s choice. I will face the Joker as well as his enemies. Remember. i am zigo.
This music can&#39;t get out of my head after 4 years .. damn
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=61">1:01</a>
my favorite movie of all time
The BEST Joker makeup to exist
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=133">2:13</a> Um guys are those sparks? 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😰😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥🤫🤫🤫
This movie is so good, same goes to The Batman, Hope Warner realizes that some of us like movies to be so serious like Snyder&#39;s Justice League.
My favourite movie ❤
Is this movie available in hindi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=65">1:05</a> that chuckle 👿

Love the part where he shoots Deneiro
This guy is too good an actor. Flawless❤❤❤
This movie was absolutely amazing. Even 4 years later it’s definitely in my top 5 favorite films ever.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=140">2:20</a>
<b>Willem Dafoe</b> should’ve been the joker during the this time. As a set up for <b>Ben Affleck’s</b> own Batman movie 🍿😢
This movie was very telling. Like foreshadowing of what was to come. This was before COVID. Wearing masks, civi unrest, &quot;What kind of coward would do something that cold-blooded? Someone who hides behind a mask.&quot;
What is the name of that movie, if it is one, I have no idea
Hyped for the sequel ❤❤❤
Joker takes the comic book character and makes him into a sad yet interesting person, lead by Joaquin Phoenix’s outstanding performance, engaging all the way through, and a dark tone with it.
I know just enough about the Joker from The Dark Knight despite not seeing it, but an deeper look into his origin looks amazing and this trailer proves it.
Art imitating life. This trailer says so much about those who aren&#39;t often heard in society. The build up to him losing his mind will really make you think about how we handle folks with mental illness. If someone would have just given a damn and helped him maybe things wouldn&#39;t have gotten so bad for him.  This movie and this trailer really makes you think I honestly don&#39;t know how part 2 will out do this.
While I found the movie itself to be far too depressing, this is still, hands down, the greatest trailer ever made.
I dunnno.  I can&#39;t find this movie in ANY theatre.
i wish Joaquin make the second  part of this movie soon ❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=84">1:24</a>
Now that is a masterpiece. Lost count, the number of times I watched this.
Oh Arthur it’s not just you the world has gotten crazier out there this movie was a masterpiece
What a perfect song for this.
Why aren&#39;t more trailers like this? Doesn&#39;t give away the whole plot. Shows powerful and beautiful scenes, its just perfect.
I do think this trailer is arguably better than the movie itself
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=140">2:20</a>
I&#39;ve always loved this movie. I feel like we as a society are getting close to what happens in the film
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=61">1:01</a>
It&#39;s 11/4/23, who&#39;s still watching this?
This is the best joker movie
It was an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23era">#era</a>
still getting goosebumps, this trailer is just perfect
BEST TRAILER EVER, THE BEST MOVIE, THE BEST CHARACTER, THE BEST ACTOR...THE BEST OF DC
this joker movie is soo lame. the movie itself was a real joke. he was just a dumb insane criminal. he got depressed because he got hit with thin plywood board lol! joker is supposed to be super smart, unpredictable insane mastermind. this is just insanity + no mind whatsoever. just a normal criminal. if anything I&#39;ve faced more hardships than him for real😂😂

Después de 4 años y esperando la parte 2
Amazing <b>how both this trailer and the actual movie are already one of Warner Bros’s BEST modern Masterpieces</b>
When I told my family I wanted to watch this movie, they all laughed at me. Well no one&#39;s laughing now...
yep, still coming back
best DC movie ever.
4 years and still watching the trailer - stunning 👏👌 🏆
One of the shitersr movies I’ve ever seen movie drags with no action for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=99">1:39</a> minutes
My biggest mistake of 2019? <b>Never seeing this in theaters,</b> that’s what.
goated trailer, literally one of my favorite ever!
Great movie.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=84">1:24</a> <b>cries</b> its so beautiful
One of the rare movies that&#39;s pro male and not a movie that encourages male hatred or glorifies male sacrifice and stoicism.
4 years later &amp; still a masterpiece.
🔥
Going to watch this hope it’s as good as everyone said… I’ll be back !
I will always regret for not seeing this masterpiece in a theater
This and The Dark Knight are the best things Warner DC ever did
👌💔😭
4 years later and I’m still going back to this trailer, and still feel the chills of what a masterful trailer and the movie is. DC might missed most of the time but when it hits, it’s a home run.
Incredible Warner Bros Pictures
Wonderfull Warner Bros Picture Brasil
Spectacular Joker.  Fantastic Coringa Teaser.
P
I absolutely loved this movie. It finally made DC movie’s entertaining to me. Real life isn’t always happy or funny. This showed the darker side to it all which made it extremely moving especially by tying mental illness into it. Cannot wait for the second one.
❤
Sequel comes out 2024 can’t wait should be good for sure 😈😈
When I look back at this trailer as an adult I get chills man.
Revive of great art movies..Greatest tragedy explained beautiful concept.. Music Joaquin performance touches soul.. Each &amp; everyone has to search their own identity....Won Oscar Deserved oscar
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=52">0:52</a> he look at her with such love in his eyes
This trailer and this film helped me cope in the months after my father’s death
This teaser is so good. Cant wait for the next movie. First was amazing
Arthur IT IS getting crazier out there
One of the few trailers that’s just as good as the movie.
Very amazing movie I like it ,it is masterpiece😙💛💛
Yeah this movie sucked.
А, ну тут безусловно будут нытики которых совершенно не интересует качество произведения. Эти любители поговорить о проблемах в обществе несчастных людей. Я вам скажу наивные. У любого вида есть четкие цели и задачи в своей среде обитания. Лабораторная камера для экспериментов над мышами - не их среда. Цели и задачи людям, диктует социум с его правилами и законами. Это полностью работа природных генетических механизмов эволюции. Вы можете и дальше выяснять кто кого обидел, хм, до анархии.
Я всё таки посмотрел этот фильм.<br><br>Однако снимать фильм по комиксам Тодд не особо хотел — для него они были слишком «вычурными» и неинтересными.<br><br>«Джокер» собрал 335,5 миллионов долларов в США и Канаде и 738 миллионов в других странах, что в итоге вместе составило сумму в $1,074 миллиарда. Картина стала шестым кассовым фильмом 2019 года и самым кассовым фильмом с рейтингом R всех времён, а также первым фильмом с рейтингом R, который вообще собрал миллиард. С точки зрения соотношения бюджета фильма в 55 миллионов долларов, фильм также стал самым прибыльным фильмом, основанным на комиксах.<br><br>Самый нелепый фильм который я только видел. Ну серьёзно, эти сборы такой же абсурд как и цивилизованные люди сегодня. Я понимаю, что от режиссёра комедийного жанра ждать большего не приходится по определению. К актерам конечно я полностью лоялен. Но отсутсвие секса в таком фильме? Эти попсовые сцены снятые видимо на телефон? К концу вообще, картина скатилась к какому-то музыкальному клипу, что вызывает недоумение. Это что такое? У меня есть ответ, но я старый для этого. <br><br>Ещё мне не понравилось, что вокруг бессмысленная мазня какая-то, но это такое конечно...<br><br>А вот по-настоящему смешное, это то, что я уже 5 лет выслушиваю нытьё элиты 😆
Fantastic Coringa Teaser
Wonderfull Warner Bros Picture.
Can&#39;t wait for Joker 2
As a psycho who works as a Clown<br>I see this as an absolute Masterpiece🤡
This trailer is still a masterpiece
guys i rlly need the song, whats its name?
The music is so good.
Good
❤
Best trailer in the history of movies .
Epic trailer for a fantastic film. Phoenix deserved that oscar. Can&#39;t wait for Part II.
Considering the time we live in, we need such a Joker more than ever.
What’s amazing about this movie is how they portrayed Joker in a ultra realistic manner. It’s disturbing because you can actually watch this and say it’s very possible for a human being to turn out like this. It’s unlike your typical Joker movie where he is portrayed as an over-the-top psychopath comic book villain.
It&#39;s already been 4 years of this Cinematic Masterpiece trailer.
If joker was real he’d be a great best friend to be around
A ground breaking film in every regard.... however I can only see the next Joker film being a diminished version of this, particularly with Stefani Germanotta copying Joaquin Phoenix (because she was such a fanatic and wants to inhabit him for her own attention) the same thing she did when she was suppose to do a tribute to David Bowie at the brits, but made a complete mockery of it by making it about her 🙄. I can see this film being made around the Harley Quinn character and not the Joker and his other movie with Ridley Scott (Napoleon) being based around Vanessa Kirby&#39;s character rather than the actual movie. Such a shame that great directors, actors, editors and script writers have to allow this madness for the sake of the insane-woke agenda and woketards, this has already impeded on the quality and greatly impacts the integrity of the film.<br><br>Thank goodness we would still have this one, untainted!
A villain born from a capitalist system
I don&#39;t watch old trailers, I watch old memories

Este tailler es mejor que la película.
You know a movie is awesome, when you came back to the trailer after watching it.
2019: Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?<br><br>2020: Hold my beer!
So, this an official DC movie now? I didn&#39;t really care for this movie all that much. I thought it was good, not great. However, if one villain deserves a solo movie with an R rating, it&#39;s definitely the Joker
Best trailer ever and the movie is a masterpiece!!
This trailer alone deserves awards.<br>Chills everytime
Both the trailer and the movie are a masterpiece
Este trailer es de por sí una obra de arte.
Dark gritty and perfect
I’m ngl this trailer is so much better than the actual movie. The movie itself…is okay and was basically so derivative of Scorsese I just couldn’t get into it. but I actually come back to this specific trailer over and over because it’s so epic
Arguably the best DC movie ever made, no super heroes, no magic, no powers, just a man who’s disenfranchised <br>who’s trying to find his way living in a society that does not care for him or people like him.
It was this movie or I forgot the others that came out that same time but I told my people hey let&#39;s watch the joker. My pops was a joker fan but never really go into comics that much but I took him to see it and he loved it.
I love this movie
This movie made me feel sickened!
Charming yet deranged, that&#39;s the best description for the music. And possibly, for Joker
Back there to say we dont need a joker 2. This masterpiece is the only way.
Nunca superaré este trailer
&quot;I used to think my life was a tragedy......but now I realize, it&#39;s a comedy.&quot;
Masterpiece!!
Still a masterpiece.
❤
No matter what anyone say. We love Arthur.
I am literally him
That happened to our friend Ricardo O&#39;Farrill.
To this day, there hasn&#39;t been a better trailer than this masterpiece. Long live Joker.
Masterpiece, a bless for humanity.
Still a masterpiece of a trailer 3 years later.
We all have felt the things what he feels in the movie at some point of time in life....  (🎬  <br>Very close to my ❤)
its.... its been 4 years...
Best movie of the history of the world
Still watching it
4 years later and this trailer is still a masterpiece
The comments make it seem like this came out 10 years ago lol
Barbie movie gonna solo this
What name music ?
Thank you Todd for making the sequel possible i&#39;ve been waiting for this since 2019 🫡🤡 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freejoker">#FreeJoker</a>
This trailer is timeless

Waiting for Joker 2
4 years anniversary
Bro the trailer was better and more tesne than the movie like wtf i know im nit the only onw who thought this 😂

This movie is a masterpiece it does not really need a sequel this deserves to be up there with godfather the cinematography and music is amazing I love this film.
Been almost 3 years still fresh
Anyone watching this trailer in 2023?
Joaquín se ganó el Óscar desde este trailer...
The best trailer ever made
The greatest trailer of any movie of all time
Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! I&#39;m scared of a sequel.  Maybe we should just let this one stand on its own??!!!🫣
the movie is very relatable
Trailer made me cry 😭
Its been 3 years, damn it&#39;s still makes me tear up everything
This trailer is better than any marvel  trailer that has been released in phase 4 and 5

No heroes, no villains, no action and no super powers, just Arthur Fleck. Please DC just do the same for the second movie.
perfection.
Best Teaser ever 💖
Such a shame they never did anything more with this Joker - it didn&#39;t need to tie in to any &#39;universe&#39; but damn they could have made a sequel where we see his perspective as Batman &#39;rises&#39;. Wasted opportunity.
everything is frickin&#39; perfect!!!
This is up there with some of the greatest trailers ever.
Nostalgia
The best part was this movie hit just before covid and the world literally went full clown world
This movie was so overrated. Just watch it again. I love mr Phoenix but he was the worst joker, he sounded like a cry baby.
I can&#39;t count how many times this trailer made me cry.
Idc how many people will hate the sequel I’m interested in how this plays out especially after the first film was just so intense
🤡🃏❤️ happy Valentine&#39;s Day Lady Gaga
This was a phenomenal movie trailer to movie everything was great
besides Joaquin&#39;s acting this movie is terrible
One of the greatest movies and performence&#39;s of all time<br>,,Don&#39;t Smile&quot;
Great trailer, disappointing movie.
Still remember seeing this for the first time
Genial joker - genila film... WOW
Very worried they’re gonna f*ck up Joker 2 and ruin the nostalgia of the first.

Maybe the real Joker were the friends we made along the way. -Arthur Fleck
A masterpiece
i&#39;m always rewatching this trailer.
Best trailer of all time IMO. The “I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it&#39;s a comedy” with the soundtrack is legendary.
This is right up there with the inception trailer
People complaining about the atrocities, madness, and outrageous stuff displayed in the movie is unbearable. Joker is a chaotic person who wishes chaos, everything they said was exactly supposed to be in the movie . This was a masterpiece.
Joker is one of the most powerful, well made comic book movies of all time, Todd Philip’s created a masterpiece, Joaquin Phoenix nailed the role of Joker 👏👏👏
Still to this day, the trailer gives me chills especially at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=85">1:25</a>
Oscar worthy trailer
I remember watching the teaser in the theatres for the first time. It was so damn magical.
Song anybody? It sounds like the continental by Ginger Rogers.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=124">2:04</a> to the end is so damn memorable. The music makes it so damn perfect
TAXI DRIVER &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; joker
End of 2022 and this is still by far the best trailer ive ever seen tantamount to the movie itself.
I have never seen nor been interested in seeing a marvel movie. I loved comics when I was a kid but as an adult I always felt like &#39;comic book and superhero movies are for kids&#39;. This is the first Marvel trailer that has ever made me want to rethink that. It took me 3+ years just to see the trailer for the first time. That&#39;s how little I have paid attention to that stuff up until now.
Best movie ever
Nunca irei superar esse trailer, sempre assisto!

Yo, i already watched the movie a ton of times but I still come back to this teaser for some reason

This movie&#39;s plot is basically &#39;what if Charlie Chaplin had a gun&#39;
If you just listen to the sound and don’t watch the video and don’t understand english, this trailer would sound like a romantic movie
I watched this film few times but I wanted to back to watch this trailer again and still I think it&#39;s a masterpiece.
watching this movie was a waste of time
Any Man DONT had DOCTORS in G🌞D🌫️ 🌅NaturAL🌄 🌪️🏞️makS ###
That face ... just kindness. When his doctor ask him.
I just watched this trailer again in 2022 and I was vaulted back into time. The music once again gave me chills. The cinematics made my jaw drop again. <br><br>...and the story is still exactly how mine could have been written.
this movie was a master peace
Glad he&#39;s back as J
One of the BEST MOVIES EVER!!
Chills watching the trailer even after watching the whole movie a number of times 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓

One of the greatest movies of all times I went to the movies about eight times to see this film
This trailer make me tear
We truly do live in a society…
Todd making movies great again
They should have an Oscar category for trailers. I keep coming back to watch this...just to marvel at how good it is.
The trailer was straight up fire!
The trailer is awesome
This movie is joker’s official backstory, I don’t care what anyone says.
Two franchise making their villians<br>One made a Alien then gave it all of the power in the universe <br>The other Made a ill man then took everything from him.
October 4 should be JOKER day🤡
Pure masterpiece ✨️
Yeh, the bad guys on the subway were drunk business men. Hollywood stinks.
The best DC film since The Dark Knight
This trailer is such a work of art
This trailer is phenomenal!!! It’s insane that the movie is better than this movie trailer!!!😂
the joker in this movie is the type of villain that you would feel empathetic for
Arthur Fleck is the type of person I would be great friends with just because of how kind he and how he’s always trying to make people laugh. Maybe not when he’s stabbing people or shooting them in the face
The last great movie before COVID swept everything
I can&#39;t wait for the sequel coming in 2024!😁
This movie is the exact representation of an average man.
When they called him a freak it made me tear up because I can relate to the Joker&#39;s pain as people looked at me that way growing up and made me feel like one
Though I have my issues with this film, as a Joker movie, god… damn, this trailer is just exhilarating! Easily one of the best I have seen and, no matter how I may feel about the film now, I will never forget how excited I was when this trailer first came out 😁

This is the down to Earth relatable film of the modern era.<br><br>In early/mid 2000s it was Napolean Dynomite and Juno, in the 1980s it was The Breakfast Club, and today, it&#39;s Joker.
Is it just me or do I keep coming to this trailer
After long period i saw the trailer and it has same potential as before
Better than any trashy marvel movie.
A musical sequel, titled Joker: Folie à Deux (transl. &quot;Madness for Two&quot;), is scheduled to be released on October 4, 2024, with Phillips and Phoenix returning.
Batman is the hero Gotham needed. Joker is the hero Gotham deserved.
The movie itself was ok..  didn&#39;t have the emotional pull of great films.  This trailer is excellent though
Dont remember how many times I had watched this. How many times you watch, you will never get tired of this.
If Warner Bros makes more movies like this, we’d have so many damn masterpieces
Masterpiece...
First time I saw this, it was a preview in the movie theatre. I immediately got goose bumps, and had a feeling this could be a Oscar winner.
This trailer was so good
10.04.24 😁
3 years later and I&#39;m still watching this trailer
Do you guys know the song on the end of the video trailer?
One of the greatest trailer ever made in film industry
This is getting a part 2?!
Well, I am here because this masterpiece is getting a second movie. See you guys in 2024.
Can&#39;t wait to see what they do with part 2
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=124">2:04</a> chills
The movie was good. But, please forgive me. This trailer alone was just a masterpiece.
He came back, but he won&#39;t be alone <br>10.04.24
Vengo solo a recodar lo epico que fue este trailer... ❤
🦇 Seriously WB, Please consider releasing Batgirl 🦇<br>Some of us really want to see it!
Here after seeing the release date of Joker 2
Folie A Deux, october 4 of 2024
Joker returns in October 2024.
To me this is by far the best trailer ever made
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=123">2:03</a> yo yendo a ver barbie
I wanted to like this but it was sooo boring I couldn&#39;t finish
Still the best
I want part two this movie and also very pot too the actor i love Joaquin Phoenix.
Three years later. It did get crazier out there
Still watching the trailer untill now 2022
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=95">1:35</a> This tells Me that this whole thing was real and that Thomas Wayne really was as awful as they showed him to be
I always come back to this video whenever I feel sad, anger, or joy. This teaser trailer are so different than the others. I don&#39;t know why but it&#39;s like my big mood or something.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=81">1:21</a> THAT MELODY
Kino AF.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=90">1:30</a> when this trailer dropped i thought the joker was in the interrogation room by himself and he was dancing in there like a savage for the people to see on the other side of the glass
I know that this is called acting but.. the way he looked at her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=53">0:53</a> .. is just wow 😭💕
Tiap lagi sedih kenapa kepikiran muter ulang trailer Joker 🤡😌
ㄔ……well good video : )
This movie becomes my addiction
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=110">1:50</a> I wish he said the line like this in the movie it’s so much better
I have watched this movie 10 times already but I&#39;m still here in 2022 watching the trailer again 🤦
Waiting second part
bruh this is like the best trailer ever
This still gives me goosebumps, one of the best cinematic trailers I&#39;ve ever seen!
All it takes is one bad day...<br>- The Joker
I mean….this trailer did had a musical vibe to it.
Nostalgia
I just want to say this the sort of film you could say good to the degree of painful. That&#39;s how affective Jauqain Phonex is an actor.
I came back because they announced Joker 2.
Quien más vino al entrar que habrá Joker 2 ?
Y’all there is a sequel coming out it was just announced !
Joachin Phoenix extraordinaria actuacion!!!
Watching this marvellous trailer in these mad times of 2022.
Came here after a gap of 2 years and it still gave goosebumps.
Joker 2 announced baby!
who came here after hearing about the sequel?, like if you did.
You will never understand the damage you did to someone,<br>Until the same thing is done to you.<br>- joker💯
I miss heath ledger to be honest ☹️
after almost 3 years man.. THE SEQUEL IS COMING
I&#39;m excited for the sequel
the sequel could be the best thing we have ever seen or the worst
A Joaquin Phoenix “JOKER” sequel is officially in the works &amp; director Todd Phillips has revealed the title for the sequel will be “JOKER”: Folie à Deux. (Madness For Two)♦️🌹<br>Who’s here after the Announcement today by Todd Phillips 😱🔥
Yes.. We all know that if there hadn&#39;t been a better idea than the first, there wouldn&#39;t be a second, which exists, because Joker II is on its way, and now we can only wait for this masterpiece.
here we go again, joker 2
JOKER 2 YAS
JOKER 2 IS HAPPENING! 🃏🃏
LETS GO
Folie à Deux
JOKER 2 LETS GOOOOOOOOO
I still get chills watching this trailer. It’s so amazing. I don’t care what people say DC is better than marvel
👑👑👑👑👑
Hats off to Joaquin Phoenix for his masterful acting!
This movie and The Batman are truly realistic and because of that incredible
This trailer made me understand what art is. Coming back to this trailer over and over and getting really emotionally.
This trailer deserves a oscar
This movie will forever be my favorite it’s an absolute masterpiece
Litterally me
Who agrees life was good when this film came out?
If you weren&#39;t there when this dropped, then you can&#39;t understand
Here after a White Nationalist Terrorist shot and killed 10 black people in Buffalo, New York. Nobody has learned the lessons put forward by this film and society is continuing to produce &quot;Jokers&quot;.
this is the best i litterally watched it 4 times
Goosebumps 🔥🔥 music ❤️
I wish this was connected to &#39;The Batman&#39;. This Joker would&#39;ve matched perfectly with The Riddler. Both villains that you can understand and agree in some areas.
El tráiler me encantó en especial Joaquín Phoenix buena interpretación
There’s no way its already been 3 years.
THE BATMAN &amp; THE JOKER
❤️
3 years.... This trailer changed me bruh. What a time. I had never been so hyped.
Both Batman and Joker really gone thur their past like how heroes and villains get trama by childhood and what they become really Batman and Joker really gone thur sad and true life
This movie is the goat

Enters thru Exit<br><br>Just joker things
Dark, depressing, minimal or no humor..  DC should be. That&#39;s why we fans love DC.❤
“the child who is not openly welcomed by the village will burn it down to feel it’s warmth”
True crime fans: watch this. It’s a pretty accurate portrayal of the making of a serial killer tbh.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=74">1:14</a>
I&#39;m glad he won an Oscar for the joker great job.

The trailer for this movie is so good.
The last time that a trailer actually got me completely hyped for a media product. Gives me goosebumps still.
Few movies had this much impact in real world.
Just thought about this, the batman and the joker are both just movies that take place in the DC universe. They don’t connect to other movies. But what if they did? I know it would work, but omg would I love to see this joker and the batman on screen.
Best actor
I watchwd it way over rated it hadd good scenary sometimes and graphics the pictures were lightly above average but it was runnis i compared it to the butterfly affect this or thats iyd say watch butterfly affect over this which is rubbish too
Why does 2019 feel like it was just yesterday
this masterpiece now the batman, I&#39;m glad DC is working on quality more than quantity
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=110">1:50</a> 🃏
How about another sequel WB?
3 years...
Probably the only movie trailer with 84 million views after , way after the movie has been released
Can’t believe this trailer is 3 years old today
Legendary Trailer
This trailer is so awesome.

This movie is a masterpiece
Still watching it. Phoenix nailed it. 🃏
My best actor: joaquin phoenix    My best film: joker
Why so serious🤡.
Just watching this brings back so many memories. This was such a good movie<br><br>Anyone here 2022
Masterpiece
In 2015&#39;s Batman #38, the Joker reveals himself as immortal , having been exposed to Electrum, an alien chemical that was also in the meteorite that gave Vandal Savage his immortality , and fuels the Lazarus Pits that keep Ra&#39;s Al Ghul young

😴😴😴😴
I still come back to this trailer every once in a while because it&#39;s so good.
Como recuerdo el meme de los simpsons con el Joker de Jared Leto atado a la silla del tren diciendo a todos &quot;Pero solo lo vieron 2 minutos y 24 segundos&quot; y le responden tipo &quot;Y lo amamos. Nunca mas vuelva&quot; jajajajaja
What kind of coward would do something that coldblooded someone who hides behind a mask
This is a very mean, cruel and nasty place.
great film
Superb Story ☺️ Lovely Work 👍
who came back after seeing pattinson&#39;s psycho batman?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=84">1:24</a>
Watching this again after The Batman... I really wish this was the Joker we got in The Batman&#39;s universe
This until now is one of the most fantastic trailers I ever saw. The movie is great, but couldnt forfill, what I felt watching this right here.
Just saw this movie for this first time yesterday and I really don’t understand why I didn’t see it 2 years earlier it was so good
such a classic to this day
this movie was a cultural reset
I remember watching this movie alone in a Theater full of strangers and it just turned out to be one of the best moments of my life. A masterpiece through and through. I was so stunned.
What a masterpiece it was !
Better and more compelling than the full length trailer. Excellence.

Batman literally releasing in a week<br>Youtube:Yo check out Joker teaser trailer
Best movie of the decade, century, all time ❤️ p.s the best movie trailer ever !!
I keep coming back to this. This is by the far the best trailer I have ever seen.
Thing really did go crazy after this film was released. 🤡
2022 is my Joker era 😎
the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen, without a doubt a great reflection
Gossebumps greatest mind biography ❤️
❤
Still the best movie trailer I&#39;ve ever seen. So artistic and passionate.
This and godzilla hands down the best trailers ever made!!!!!
I love this movie. Thank you for bringing this pov to life
So much heart poured into this film! What a treat!
Best trailer of all time
This movie reminds me to just smile. I&#39;m in a very difficult time in my life life and my therapist tells me to just smile and be happy. I&#39;m on a path of suicide, I really am. And I sometimes wonder, If I smile and try to be happy, will things be better? This trailer alone just reminds me of the shell of my former self I truly am.

i can&#39;t lie, whenever DC make a stand alone movie ( Dark Knight, Joker) and now the new batman. the trailers, music, cast and the movies are out of this world
Why does the title say now playing in theaters when it&#39;s a trailer for a movie that probably came out a couple of months before the film came out?
Is it just me...<br>or is it getting crazier out there?
Probably the most realistic joker
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=81">1:21</a> the music is so good
The thing is, the scene where author was smiling at the clown mask guy, it seemed so hypnotic, it made me smile with him, it made me laugh
Revisit this trailer after almost 3 years later and it&#39;s still one of the greatest movie trailers ever made. The music is so grande and classic!
I can&#39;t believe WB did survive during the era of Endgame
Simply Brilliant. Powerful
MASTERPIECE!!!

Man good times
This movie is masterpiece before the pandemic
What I love is the irony of that quote “what kind of coward would do something so cold blooded.? Someone who hides behind a mask” <br>Batman doesn’t exist yet but when he does, he will be someone behind a mask but not doing cold blooded things. So not necessarily does someone who hides behind a mask mean they are cold blooded. Idk….I hope k explained that right 😅
Two years really fly by. I remember watching this trailer over and over again building up my excitement. This was a brilliant film. Joaquin Phoenix is just magnificent, he definitely deserved that Oscar. The score is also amazing. One of the best films I have ever seen.
We’re all clowns
Lol MCU still hasn’t received a major Oscar win
Esta es la presentación perfecta para el comienzo de un villano………

I wish i could have watched it in the theatre
&quot;she told me I had a purpose, to bring joy and laughter to the world&quot;<br>You sure do to us.
i hate when they show something in the trailer thats not in the movie. i waited for the scene where he is exaggerating rolling down the steps at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=95">1:35</a>  but its no where to be found in the movie
EL JOKER
I wish the music was on Apple Music so I could listen to it all the time
JAJAJAJAJ pasaron 2 años, y sigo considerando este como el mejor tráiler que he visto XD
2 days later someone ruined my life
For the very first time the trailer &amp; movie are both good.
This is the reality of our society... This movie really  tragic but real, gruesome but thrilling.. this is the society, where we live...
May he have a sequal !

i did like the movie but the worst part of the movie was the awful joker laugh mark hamill joker laugh is so much better
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=5">0:05</a></b><b> You can see his anguished expression inside, but he smiles gently to try to hide it. It&#39;s sad.</b>
Truely a masterpiece ✨👏👌🙌😍
My favorite movie 🎥😍❤💛💕
Although people fight over who did it better we can all agree… MARK HAMILL HAD THE BEST ANIMATED JOKER BY FAR
Still the best trailer of all time..
Villain who made up by Batman <br>Villain who as more fans <br>Villain who as a movie <br>Villain who deserves as oscar<br>But the name of villain is 🃏𝗝𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗿
the last movie I saw before COVID, feels like a lifetime ago
Anyone still back here for this teaser in nov 2021
I used to think my life was a cringe compliation, but now I realize...it&#39;s a try not to laugh challenge
This looks so stupid.
0/10 worst movie ever, he didnt have Broken written on his forehead, tsk tsk tsk
This is the kind of trailer you keep coming back to, because of how good it is.
2 years and this trailer still amazing.
Can’t believe it’s already been 2 years. Absolute masterpiece
MAGNIFICENT
Overrated movie and performance from phoenix.
Que hermoso trailer , cuando lo veo me hace recordar aquellos días donde todos eran felices ignorando lo que se venía
It&#39;s hard to watch him as Johnny Cash and then watch him as The Joker. He&#39;s an amazing method actor!
watching this every time i see SHIB moons and all other altcoins with plenty of world changing usecases dumps
Most emotional trailer:of the centyre
<b>And the Oscar goes too… Joaquin Phoenix Joker</b><br><b>Arthur: You Get What You F-cking Deserve!</b>

Best trailer
Damn it’s been 2 years already
El título en el trailer JOKER, me parece o es el mismo que the BATMAN?
Ya más de dos años q me vi este trailer, todavía recuerdo las emociones q sentí al verlo por primera vez
This movie is both upsetting and realistic
It&#39;s not a thriller movie is just a sad movie<br>.. So many emotions in one man... He is unbelievable actor... This hero brings so much pain.... It&#39;s just a sad story.... He was such a good man and they made him a monster... That&#39;s Is my way to see him...
Phoenix killed this performance!!!! 👏 for this GREAT,EXCEPTIONAL ACTOR!
Health ledger would be so proud of this man
Still coming back for the trailer
I&#39;ve never watched both suicide squad and the dark knight trilogy. I just watch this. And I just really love this.
The worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t
Só voltei pra dizer q esse filme é perfeito
incel moment
Overrated movie of all time
Never was Joaquin Phoenix any better than in “JOKER”.   The actor has such tremendous screen presence that he seamlessly morphes into the “Arthur/Joker”* character, making  him seem as real as can be.   The  performance of a lifetime probably.   Hats off‼️.   ❤️🎩❤️<br><br>* Through the motion picture, we basically learn why Arthur became Joker.   On the one hand, good Arthur had nothing left to lose.  On the other hand, evil Joker had everything to gain.
When you realize it’s the 3 year anniversary since Joker released in theaters!<br><br>I used to think that my life was a tragedy, now I realize it’s a comedy 🤡<br><br><br>2 more years to go 🃏🤡
This trailer is perhaps the best I&#39;ve ever seen.... it sets the mood perfectly
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=123">2:03</a>
The devil in I by slipknot is the perfect song for this film... truly<br><br><br><br>well at least the first few words ....&quot;undo these chains&quot;...sort of meaning of u let me show u my real emotions as oppose to putting on a face of normalcy u&#39;ll see all the bottled of anger due to him being disregarded by society and ridiculed.....<br>So when u hear &quot;undo these chains and ill so u my rage&quot;....its basically &quot;let me show u what society has made me&quot;....my anger had ben built up from yrs of being ignored(disregarded) and ridiculed and taken for granted
I will never forget how amazing this movie was and still is
Joaquin phoenix con joker diventa irraggiungibile
Gypsy crusader the movie
Best teaser trailer in film history.
Goosebumps even after I’ve seen it 4 times.
I repeat this movie 100 time and still Wouldn&#39;t get it
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=95">1:35</a> is it really in the movie?
looking back at the trailers it really makes me miss 2019 and the hype for the movie when seeing this trailer
This movie also show mens emotions
Joe many liberals does it take to change a log by bolb????? None, their too busy???? Their gender😂😂😂😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=22">0:22</a>, that&#39;s why Loki and Joker are so relatable.
I come back to this place when i&#39;m having a bad time just to recall the good times, 2019 was such a good year to me
Great movie his own suffering an the transformation his own body goes through..more than an Oscar
now that&#39;s a trailer alright!
I almost forgot to watch it today
Probably the greatest trailer ever made lol
the instrumental is sooooo GOOOOOD
Swejtube for Susan whoajewski sux
This trailer itself confirmed a Oscar for Joaquin!. Only person could have played this role better would have been Mr Charlie Chaplin himself!!
I’m scared to see the condiment king in this universe
Probably like 20 grand budget movie. Never seen a worse movie than this ever
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=95">1:35</a> I don&#39;t remember this scene, did they remove it from the movie??
We alwers keep arver smile 🙂🙂🙂🙂
who is here after watching cruella?
You know a trailer slaps hard when 2 years later, it has over a million likes and an active comment section
simply divine x
Is it weird that I’ve seen this movie more than 3 times but I still come watch the trailer lol because it’s so good
best trailer ever
Who&#39;s here in 2021 and 2022 still enjoying this trailer?
Please... Do NOT make a sequel. Here we have one of the best movies ever made in the history of cinema. This movie WROTE history actually in cinema. Do not ruin it. No need to see nothing else. Make 1000 films about joker in the DC film universe. But dont destroy this.                            A movie lover.
This is so much better than the actual movie lmfao
after watching the movie 1000000000000000000000000 times I had watched the trailer 2000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times
Perfection absolute perfection of a movie
Best trailer I’ve ever seen
We live in a society
Payasiel
Here to revisit a MASTERPIECE.
Amazing movie 👏👏👏
I have this movie.. And i still come back for this master piece
The last great thing we all witnessed together as people just before everything went to s**t. I can&#39;t stop thinking about that.
Two years later and I&#39;m still re watching this beautiful trailer. Always makes me smile :)
Aún no lo supero
This might be the best teaser trailer in cinema history.
If only Movie trailers got Oscars Joker would of received one.
Going back to watch this trailer again makes it feel like I&#39;m watching it for the first time again
I like the fact that they named it &quot;joker&quot; and not &quot;the joker&quot;, Nice touch 😁
I finally watched this recently and honestly think this would work as canon in Batman lore
Did anyone ever find out the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=87">1:27</a>?
The best joker Joaquan Phoenix ❤️
Finally ! A decent contemporary movie
This movie, wow, I&#39;m still stunned by it watching the trailer.  I remember watching at an employee screening at WB, I had no words.  A co-worker had seen it a few days before and wouldn&#39;t say a word about it.  I know now why she didn&#39;t.  It&#39;s quite possibly one of the most moving, emotional, sad films ever made.  And I mean that in the most brilliant of terms.
💀💀
I think that this is one of the best outfits the joker has ever had including the hair and makeup.
I remember seeing this two years ago as an ad. I never watch ads but this trailer was so intriguing and so well made that I had to watch the whole thing.I remember thinking that this was the best trailer I ever seen. I haven’t gotten a chance to watch the movie yet but today is finally the day! Two years later! 😁😁
This movie is objectively a masterpiece
They should make a bunch of joker movies each with a different backstory for the joker and each one talking about how it’s the first movie from the jokers perspective because of what the joker says about not knowing his own past
Name: Joker<br>Role: Villain<br>Haters: 0<br>Lovers:<br>👇
Heath Ledger would have been proud.
Joke is on ppl who don’t take mental illness seriously. <br><br>What a movie.
What&#39;s the movie name
I wish I could rewatch this trailer again
We live in a society.
so saddddddd
This trailer is so well put together. Amazing music and editing.
there should be a movie in which Margot Robbie play a role of Harley Quinn WITH Joaquin Pheonix as JOKER.... do something warner bos.
What’s the matter you ugly little child, don’t we make tou laugh? We are clowns, we are funny!
This trailer gets me so hype the music and the dancing Phoenix does fits.so.well
Nostalgic. I remember being obsessed with this movie, and the great soundtrack.
Joaquin Phoenix called perfecting the Joker&#39;s laugh the toughest part of playing the character.<br><br>Joaquin Phoenix named Tim Curry&#39;s performance in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) as one of his inspirations for his performance in this film.<br><br>The second DC movie featuring the Joker to be R-rated after Batman: The Killing Joke (2016).<br><br>The film is Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s fourth Oscar nomination for acting (and his first-ever win).<br><br>The first film based on a comic book to win the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.<br><br>This film is the first theatrical live-action Batman spin-off since Suicide Squad (2016).<br>Sharon Washington&#39;s character is named Debra Kane as a tribute to Batman&#39;s co-creator Bob Kane.<br><br>The film was the second R-rated comic book film released in 2019. The first 2019 comic book film released is Hellboy (2019).<br><br>The first R-rated movie in history to make $1 billion worldwide.<br><br>Costing $55 million, this is the least expensive film to gross over $1 billion.
an underrated piece of art
Finally decided to watch this. I wished I watched it in the cinema. Wished they made more movies like this.
I think there should be a movie about the origins of Penguin in the same dark tone, it can be sick af.
I love how the cartoon joker’s calling card was a joker card and this joker has his calling card, so to say, is his medical card. At least to me that’s what it seemed like 🤷🏻‍♂️ great frickin movie
Props for the creator of the Joker &#39;19 Trailers. MASTERPIECE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=81">1:21</a> I don’t remember this laugh in the movie
Wtf i could not search for this video so i had to click a link for it
Really good show
masterpiece
Just finished this movie and wow... I don&#39;t know if I should be impressed or terrified. Joaquin, really sold the idea of what it is like to be a psycho path. Excellent performance. I still really love Heath&#39;s Joker better, however this one is definitely up there. I wonder how Joaquin&#39;s mental health is after this film. The state of mind you have to get to be able to do this must be super dark.
Graça
Joker acting crazy level
This trailer is definitely better than the final one.
Woke garbage 🗑
I wish i had that laugh
It is a good movie. But it feel like another franchise wearing joker skin. It is hollow.
Whew..... tough movievnot my cup of tea. But I did talk to him through a collaboration
Sweet as sugar...hard as ice <br>Hurt me once I will kill you twice <br>- JOKER
Who&#39;s still watching this trailer?
tought it was gonna be scary, no imma cry
There were a few shots here I don’t recall being in the movie.
I remember watching this in theaters and the audience were applauding and cheering when DeNiro got shot in the face.<br><br><br><br><br>Funny!
Insanely good.
I like that they probably took inspiration from Taxi Driver.<br><br>I like that.
I just keep coming back for this version of smile
Cuando te das cuenta que DC, solo tenía que ser DC y no buscar ser Marvel, toda película épica que tuvieron, el Joker era parte de ellos, más oscuridad que luz 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
One of the few trailers where the movie delivered. Better than anything in the MCU/DCU
And crazy part is people are still commenting

This movie is definitely better than any marvel movie ever made.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=124">2:04</a> goosebumps.

No one going to comment on the beauty that is the music? So fitting. This movie was beyond amazing.
Joker will always be the most ICONIC comic book villain of all time
When I first saw this trailer&#39;s title, I thought to myself, &quot;*sigh* it&#39;s more of DC&#39;s bs...&quot; I was 100% wrong, what came out was a f**king masterpiece
Arguably, the greatest teaser trailer of ALL TIME!..💁🏻‍♂️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc&amp;t=63">1:03</a> In reality my uncle is joyful watching a chinese costume drama
This is still one of the best trailers ever made.
A movie about a true gamer
Botw Fans when they don&#39;t get news of BOTW2 for .1 seconds after getting botw2 news
man this soundtrack is amazing
Man, that grouch parody ruined this trailer for me 😂
Why should I apologize for the monster I have become? No one apologized for making me this way -Joker
Chaplin
if there&#39;s an award for &quot;best trailer&quot;, joker would easily win
The stage of acting to be really good is actually we are all jokers.
THIS MOIVE IS A MATERPIECE
Joaquin​ phoenix​ is​ the​ best​ of​ joker🤡🤡
This trailer makes me feel happy in an odd sort of way🤡🤡🤡
So many scenes skipped in final movie :((

Lo mejor
Joker is literally the story of a white male living in America
This movie would be even better if it was heath ledger
The Joker did great acting as Joaquin Phoenix.
This movie was ok taxi driver was better
Not gonna lie. This movie was pretty predictable. Still good though.
&quot;But now I realize. It&#39;s a comedy.&quot;<br><br>More like horror.
still a damn masterpiece
Joaquin is too good for the oscars
Good but flawed movie, but damn if this isn&#39;t still one of the best edited teasers of all time, then I&#39;m Prince Philip

Who else comes back once in a while to enjoy this masterpiece of a trailer?
r.i.p dc
What a brilliant masterpiece! Bravo Mr. Phoenix, Mr. Phillips, Mrs. Guðnadóttir &amp; everyone else involved. Bellisimo! 👏
Idc what you say this trailer is still amazing
I miss this
I was way tied up with frozen at the time.  Snuck in to see three minutes of this and knew I should watch
bruh half of the clips in the trailer didnt even show in the movie :(((<br>its still a beautiful movie tho dont get me wrong
The most overhyped, depressing, superficial crucible of cliches i&#39;ve ever seen. So bad that even a most gifted actor as Phoenix couldn&#39;t make anything worth of it. A terrible disappointment, that was Joker.
Said by s
Ace is robbed turns joker thanks 😊

After 16 years of Brother Bear (2003) not being what should have been his most ICONIC role because of Disney, THIS arrives.
One of those rare movies where the trailer is just as well edited.
Best Trailer Ever!
Please dubbed in hindi
Wow!! I like how the trailers use of ‘’the stairs’’ kind of showed how his life unfolded. Started out as a tough climb trying to blend in with society but as the trailer progressed, the walk down seemed more natural and easy as portrayed by his natural movement or ‘’dancing’’. not really a fan of super hero films and comic characters but I just might download this on piratebay or something.
&quot;THIS FALL&quot;<br><br>Not just referring to when the movie would come out, but what would literally happen to the character. Brilliant
This movie is the magic DC is capable of when they are not trying to ape the MCU.
This movie describes the life of so much of us right?!
Can we do this again. Joker 2?
I’m a Marvel fan before a DC fan but I like the dichotomy between the two. Whilst Marvel can provide a more light-hearted approach whilst still being entertaining and serious and cool, DC can actually be haunting and serious and much more adult.
I’m getting Taxi driver Scorsese vibes from this video
And this was only a teaser trailer
How about another joke??🤡
この先も彼にジョーカー役をやってほしい
Imagine Joaquin accept the Dr.Strange role in Marvel, he wouldn&#39;t become an Oscar Best Actor.<br>Great decision.

This and the new Batman I fell both finally embrace the characters life and backstory
Sheesh its been 2 years since this trailer came out 😳
Even Illuminatis realize this trailer it&#39;s to dangerous to be deleted
aquí de nuevo, observando esta obra maestra de tráiler.
Can’t believe it’s been 2 years since this trailer came out. It’s crazy how fast time flies
This trailer was better then the faking movie
2 years :)
Here before the description says 2 years
He who has ears to hear, let him hear: John 3:16 says “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” God is good my friends, and He loves you!
whos here after watched zack snydyrs cut or justice league
Not really a goodmovie
This trailer is gold.
this came out on october 2019 which means it was 2 to 3 months away from covid-19. So basically you can say this movie is a tale before covid
Why is this being suggested now? Thanks YouTube. Also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23restorethesnyderverse">#restorethesnyderverse</a>
I can’t believe it’s almost been two years
(EXCELLENT) 👌🤡⚘
The fact that i see alot of debate in the comments about who is better Joaquin or Heath just proves that Joaquin played his role to perfection.

I love how this movie wasn’t necessarily the backstory of a villain. Just a disturbed man who crossed paths with the wrong people 😔
Refuse to forget how so hype this movie in 2019
This trailer is pure hype possibly one of the best teasers out there.
I know this is gonna be a masterpeice!!

Maxamilliunmus
Still an awesome trailer
I keep coming back to watch this after already having seen the movie because it&#39;s so amazing. It&#39;s actually better than the movie, not because the movie isn&#39;t excellent, but  because the trailer is just a masterpiece.
2021¿
Amazing how this movie doesn&#39;t change Joker&#39;s backstory, it just modifies it a bit. The original Joker fell into a highly toxic pool and in this Movie, he feel into a toxic society. Society can as toxic as any chemical that is toxic.
one of the best teases of all times
After watching thar horrible Cruella Disney trailer, I had to come back here just to get my mind off of it. Love this movie ♥️♠️
“We stopped checking for monsters under our bed, when we realized they were inside us.” <br>- The Joker
Who returned after watching the trailer Cruella??
ah yes.... this movie.... i asked my friends to come with me and watch this yet not one of them came... but i didnt care, went to watch it alone and tbh it feels even better
It&#39;s good that it predicted Cruella 2021
I&#39;m here after CRUELA treaser.   I love Phoenix and Emma.
The final seconds of this trailer are just spellbinding !
Si existiera un oscar a los mejores tráiler este lo ganaría sin dudarlo
OmG,seriously is @back remind to girlfriend and mother By somekind about JOKER I Watch!!!seriously Enchanting and Beautiful.
And now we got the batman coming up, this is exactly what we want from DC!
we live in a society
Looking back, this trailer was as good as a movie itself.
I’m here again after the Disney Cruella trailer.
Cruella sent me here
THIS IS NOT OVERRATED, THIS IS MASTERPIECE
Arthur would never hurt a dalmatian!!
<b>Who is here after watching Cruella?</b> I have the same feeling for both films.
Cruella
Cruella 2021 be like
Joker: When you bring me out, can you introduce me as “joker?”<br><br>Cruella: I’m Curella.
Year later and this trailer still gives me goosebumps ....masterpiece
Cruella is proof that Disney doesn&#39;t have any original ideas left.
Who is here after Cruella?
Joker : ( Phoenix ) : &quot;I Used To Think My Life Was a Tragedy But Now I Realize It Was a Comedy.&quot;<br><br>Joker ( Ledger ) : &quot;And I Thought My Jokes Were Bad.&quot;
I’m rewatching the trailer after watching the Cruella trailer as it’s basically a replica of this trailer.
Watch taxi driver then the king of comedy and then joker you have the first  film noir trilogy
This is the best thing to happen to DC since The Dark Knight (2008)
I was lucky to see this in the theaters... twice! That’s how good the movie is
just saw this movie last weekend and it was fucking awesome.

Only nawazuddin can give it justice if ever remake in bollywood
This is truly a masterpiece of a movie.
The background music, the acting, the appearance, the quality of this trailer gave me the chills of the good
Can&#39;t believe this xame out in 2019
Trash movie
This is the kind of movie - where you feel like an old timer saying &quot;they don&#39;t make them like this anymore!&quot; <br><br>It&#39;s 2021 and it&#39;s still a groundbreaking masterpiece
Another hollywierd kid actor who grew up, Fck hm, Fck his “speech” and Fck all of you.
I think in lockdown we all feel like Arthur Fleck right now.
They: &#39;Available only on Netflix!&#39;<br>Me: ha, here you go full HD: ｔｒａｉｌｅｒｓ．ｔｏ<br>hahaaha
Still one of the greatest if not the greatest trailer for a comic book movie.
