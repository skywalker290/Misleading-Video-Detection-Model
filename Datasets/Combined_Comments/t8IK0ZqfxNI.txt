Courtois 🔥🔥
Thibaut Courtois 🫶💖💖
who else is back in 2024 watching this ?!?!
Hazard destroyed the brazil that day
I feel bad for neymar
Belgium worst team in the world
Renato Augusto was the savior for Brazil, the problem is that he faced Courtois who was in the devil mode actived
Who else here after Hazard interview?
Belgium 🇧🇪
Brazil 🇧🇷
Own goll🎉
Assim como as Bolsas de ouro de Messi são tudo roubada. Esse jogo também foi.
Het is zo zielig voor belgie... Ze hebben nog  nooit een finale gehaald en hun grote broer Nederland al 3 keer. Hahahahahahahahaha
De bruyne goal was faster than light
In last 5 world cups brazil lost against european teams on knockout stage...
Unforgettable match,where were you when Kevin scored that goal?
That de bruyne shot was faster than speed of sound
Fernandinho fdp, Meu vice na libertadores.
marcelo played his heart out in this one,,, casemiro greatly missed
Brasil 1x2 Bélgica
Still here in 2023, best WC.
Godo ancor
why would you leave a player like De bryne run so free , De bryne IQ is on another level he knew it that they think he will pass
🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Dê like se voçê está vivendo a situação catastrófica do Brasil em 2023.
Belgium CHUDI

Lakaka was better then.
De Bruyne bullet Shot ☄🔥
2026 Brazil won the world Cup
Isso foi triste
Sry that we cooked u up brazil.
Ya know when are we gonna realize that Brazil players don&#39;t have it as a collective anymore
Tetouan
That 2nd goal was like a sick wrist shot in hockey. Goalie had no chance
4 years later both going home from Croatia 💪💪💪💪🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
Brazil played <br>Belgium scored
the satisfy hold a reels
Kdb insane goal 👀
O brasileiro mereceu esse vexame, por idolatrar o influencer Neymídia!!!
We should not be watching these highlights because of what Russia&#39;s now getting up to in Ukraine.
All because of Belgium goalkeeper. Otherwise they would have conceded more goals
Quite sad to see this performance from Belgium compared to their performance this last 2022 WC.
De bruyne🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=63">1:03</a> the commentary in 2014 said exactly the same when Klose scored against Brazil.
!BRAZIL BELGIUM ! GOL JAPAN GO GO NEYMAR JR NO BALIAO
Hazard played the game of his life here. I miss this Hazard
Me coming here after Kevin Debryune Shot in champions league Semifinal Madrid vs City. Indeed very similar 🙌
2014 Quarter Final<br>Argentina 🇦🇷 1 - 0 🇧🇪 Belgium<br><br>2018 Quarter Final<br>Belgium 🇧🇪 2 - 1 🇧🇷 Brazil.<br><br>Belgium surely learn thier mistake from the <br>2014 World cup against Argentina 🇦🇷<br>and that&#39;s 2018 they beaten Brazil 🇧🇷
Back when Eden Hazard was world class 😭😢
A FIFA NÃO MOSTROU O PÊNALTI EM CIMA DO GABRIEL JESUS VERGONHOSO
Jogo roubado!
Brasil cuando perdio: como perdí con bélgica, seguro por ese autogol
Lukaku&gt;&gt;&gt;Neymar
Bélgica🇧🇪: Mó paz 😎✌️<br><br><b>Renato Augusto entra em campo</b><br><br>Bélgica🇧🇪: FODEU 😰😰🥶🥶
The fire match ever
i love belgium spain argentina germany italy france japan united states odio brazil futebol club
That De bruyne goal was a rocket.

As a Portuguese fan this match is the only thing giving me hope
Being the favourites
I remember watching this match when I was 10 confident that my team (Brazil) would win. After the match ended and Brazil was defeated I cried for literal hours and even cried the next few days, even 5 years later this match still makes me sad.<br>But Congrats Belgium from brazil, you defeated us
got the Samba dancer
Best match ever
USA VS PERU 1-3
Bro why always BRAZILLLL
Brazils is so bad luck...dont worry...insallah next world cup..in hexa mission,,,🥺🥺😥😥
Kdb easily best midfielder
lol when de bruyne scored i went to check if my playback speed was on 1,5 or something...the ball just teleported into the net with a speed of light
Thanks for all these moments guy
Well played by both teams!
This was Belgium last hope to have won the world cup
I get a smoothie everytime when BRAziL looses!!!<br>Waahahahaha- AR Fan!!!
Courtois mvp
“4 Years Later” <br>Morocco: For you Brazil<br>Brazil: Thanks Morocco

Brazil is a over hyped team 😤
Brasil ganará la copa del mundo el día que tenga una buena defensa, todos los mundiales es una lástima, no sabe defender.
Alisson muito ruim, pqp...
I&#39;m here again after 4 years just to see the fabulous de bruyne goal.
Brazil  currently  worst  team 😡😡
In 2022 nayamar still crying like a pupit
--87
Brazil have disappointed for 2 decades now..
Não sei como Brasil perdeu
2022 out of group stage 😂😂
2022 Brazil lose to a team with red and white again
Just came here after Croatia knocked them out on pens
Who is here after Brazil lost to corotia
Who is After loss against Croatia 💔
BRAZIL 2022. BYE BYE BYEEEE AGAINNN
Who come here after 2022 quarter final
Now Croatia gave them a ticket back home
here we meet again
Again eliminated in the Quaters
no llores Brasil
Тот самый момент когда фаворитом была Бельгия , а не Бразилия
brazil just didn&#39;t score a goal too bro look at the size of the belgium goalkeeper
🇭🇷 Croatia will make new history🤭see u 🐈
Wonderful 👍😊.... Brasil lost is wonderful
Brazil is very confident evry world cup. I wanna see how far they can go this yr
What a shame. 2018 was the real deal for us. Guess we gonna see the Red Devils shine again in 8 years 🙌🏼
If brazil won this, I&#39;m pretty sure that France would have been trashed by this Brazil
and thats why courtois is my favorite goalkeeper!!
আশা করি এইরকম আর হবে না।
It&#39;s funny how this was Brazil&#39;s first decent team in that cup and they lost, after beating their joke group and thinking they will win everything.<br>fast forward to 2022, again same story, Croatia will be their first decent opponent and they already think they will win, while this Croatia is on the same level as this Belgium or probably even better...
Prime Belgium 🇧🇪. Now when you look back that was there chance to win the cup
Sadly we lost for them and that year, but in this year, the world cup will be ours!!!
This was their best chance, Belgium<br>De bruyne was right when he said that.
It’s crazy that this Belgium golden generation achieved nothing while every player were in their primes smh
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH puas hati gak ahh player keluar dari chelsea world cup tahun ni barai
Korean team will beat the Brazil like this at 16 of Qatar world cup 2022!
Who miss Belgium in 2018? They used to play really well. Although I love Brazil the most, I have been Belgium fan since that time.
2022 Belgium Go Home 🤣🤣
Belgium shoulda gotten to the final 2018
Who come here after belgium knocked out from group stage in wc 2022
<b>Belgium knocked out form the group stage,Fifa 2022</b><br><b><i>First of all, Belgium&#39;s 2022 team lacks unity &amp; trust.</i></b><br>Players inter-personal conflict caused them losing many games .<br>It will be hard for Belgium build a team like this.
From 3rd place to first round Eliminate😢
One of the most intense matches I&#39;ve seen in my life
Was very hard to watch this live in 2018. Though even as a Brazilian, I have to admit Belgium played very well. We got the upper hand in the second half, but by then it was too late. Hope we can win this year, but we&#39;ll see.
Belgium goalkeeper is beast
With the a bit of help from the referee. Belgium made this win. Just same now with Morocco, pay to win team
De bruyne goal was cleaner than my soap 💀
Brazil thought they was gonna make noise after beating a Garbage Mexican team only to lose to a much more Superior team
2022
Bkal klah belgia ktmu brsil
Lakaka
El mejor partido del mundial 2018 sin duda
Every world cup people fancy Brazil... And they have failed ever since...
Tim yg bisa kalahkan Brasil pasti juara, atau minimal ke final.
Terus ngapain bisa kalahkan Brasil tapi gk juara. Loyo menghadapi Perancis. Bikin jengkel aja.
Brazil need this🤣🤣🤣
Who is here watching old matches before the start of the world cup 2022🥳
David Beckham soccer advertisement before this
Brazil will win this World Cup
🔥🔥🔥😅😅❤️
I love this game😂😃
And now Canada want to compite whith as Belgium and Croatia<br>Chears from Croatia
Brazil will win this team. ❤ From 🇵🇰
Kevin is a hero
Who&#39;s the commentator?
It even hurts to watch as brazil fan still now .<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Duck that woodwork
De bruyne power shot
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=19">0:19</a> bounced his back
I find it funny that Brazil is every year the favourite but didn’t win any World Cup since 2002
ബ്രസീൽ തിരിച് വരും 💛💛
Vim do futuro pra dizer que o Brazil é Hexa campeão da Copa do Mundo 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Brasil ☕️😂😂
One day india will play World Cup 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Belgium is de best
Courtoises one of the best Goal 🥅 saved match 🙂!

Brazil is always favorite at every world cup
I still remember this game even it been 4 years. <br><br>My full family were cheering for Brazil, and i was the only one who wat cheering for Belgium. And literally everyone made fun of me.
KDB best player 👍
Courtois was on FIREEEEEEEE
💔💔💔
بلجيكا لا تستحق الفوز لأن البرازيل لعبت افضل
Brazil lost 98 2006 2010 2014 2018...the future looks promising lol,,,,,,,Neymar been with Brazil for the past 11 yrs so far and still 0 WC,,,,where is the legend Neymar??🙃🙃🙃🙃 lol
Belgium won the match, because of courtoya....
Favorite has gone! 😅
Who was the commentator in this match?? I&#39;ve been searching month after month, but in vain.
brazil would have won if it was neymar
How a keeper can win a match.
Who would win if brazil faced france?
I will get my revenge in Qatar&#39;s final tournament🇯🇵
Brasil take revenge in 2022 world cup
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
It was a fairytale for Belgium 🇧🇪 over 4 years ago
Perdeu Casemiro ficou com Ricardinho aquilo foi uma brincadeira.
Bélgica atropelou o Brasil. Mereceram a vitória.
Losser day from brasil
Orgullo europeo. Felicidades Bélgica siempre por delante de América
commentator name please?
This is Yes recibe Jesus Christ salvation personal this Yes recibe in My ♥️ 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
if the former Brazilian team reaches the quarterfinals, it will probably face either Germany or Belgium. At least two goals they take, how do they want to compete in the world cup with two elders in defense (T. silva and Marquinhos)? DT Tite is happy and confident to have beaten Bolivia and Peru in their qualifiers and thinks they are favourites. Tell him that only Neymar is in the squad and no one else. Ronaldo has already retired and Brazil is a former national team.
Brazil played well but unfortunately lost for him
De Bruyne my best Midfielder in the world
Vim rever depois do tio do luke skywalker mencionar no filme TREZE VIDAS - O RESGATE

Marcelo fails! 😞

Brazil&#39;s luck was bad that day..
Rene Augusto of Beijing
😭😭😭
Dont fool yourselves 2022 is the best Brazilian team i saw... Brazil is going to lift the six!
Era para nós termos ganhado!, mas foi melhor perder com honra para a Bélgica do que enfrentar a França e sermos humilhados.
i was born in Rio de Janeiro Brazil and my father was graduated from leuven Belgium
How much things have changed.
De bruyne two nil
🇭🇷🤝🇧🇪
I will always rembember this game 😔
Parabéns ao maior feito da Bélgica, ganhou do Brasil por 2-1 👏👏🙌🙌🇧🇪🇧🇪
🇻🇪:lo estás haciendo bien<br>🇧🇷:lo estoy haciendo TODO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>🇲🇽:No por mucho vamos eliminemos a Bélgica
Foul on Jesus was clearly penalty.
This is one of my clearest memories
What is going on here
Brazil 🇧🇷 hexa campeão 2022

I remember watching this game with belgian fans, at that moment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=53">0:53</a>, I stood up and screamed &quot;shoot&quot;, and for a second there everything felt in sync.<br>Absolute scenes, I never forget that, what a goal!
Courtois somente . A Bélgica foi amassada !

Marcelo é um comédia né Man! Tá vendo de Bruyne se aproximar... Encurta o espaço do cara broder. Não. Deixa o cara chutar pra tentar desvia o chute de cu. Fala sério.
Barzil 😥😥😥😥
🙂💔
As someone from Belgium, this was really the best day of my life. I can still feel the excitement. That magical evening and the upcoming days were amazing. Next morning, I was at the airport. You could feel the atmosphere, everyone knew what had happened the day before. Everyone was so happy. Amazing what a simple game can do.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=64">1:04</a> &quot;Brazil in deep trouble now&#39;&#39;<br>I have heard this phrase somewhere else before

Voltei só pra ver esse roubo😡

This game broke my heart😭😭
Tenks live
Are we going pass the fact Brazil didnt beat an european team in knockout since 2002?
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇪🇧🇪
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇪🇧🇪
Belgium
PQ NINGUÉM FALA DO PÊNALTI CLARO QUE NAO FOI MARCADO PRO BRASIL????!
Величайшая победа в истории Бельгийского клуба! Величайший сейв от Куртуа и величайший гол в карьере  за сборную от ДэБрюйнэ)))))))Оказывается, имеет значение, кто стоит в воротах и за кого играют ключевые полузащитники)))))
Heart broken match 😭😭😭💔
Renê Augusto quase salvou o jogo
😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I&#39;m Brazilian and I say: Belgium deserved to win.<br><br>Both teams played very well. Brazil was extremely better than the disastrous 7x1 of 2014. But Belgium took better advantage of opportunities and finishes, an example was Kevin&#39;s beautiful goal. It was a fair win and a very hot game<br><br>come 2022!!!
“O Courtois é gigante.” <br>- Neymar após dá um chute no gol e o Courtois pegar.
Tá, mas e o pênalti em cima do Gabriel Jesus????
Belgium
Xg for this game be Brazil 3.0 - 0.7 Belgium. Very clinical from Belgium
Este es el partido que le dolio a todo sudamerica
De Bruyne goal was faster than my wifi🤍
That Coutinho&#39;s assist🔥🔥 Debruyne and Coutinho 🔥Two of the best Midfielders at that time😍 and Neymar × hazard Two of the best left wingers at that time 💥💥
Japan gave Belgium a more difficult time than Brazil 😂
Poor Neymar
Go Belgium
Le Brésil , un géant Aux pieds d&#39;argile !
“Here is lukaku know Like A Tank”😂😂😂
They didn&#39;t even show in the video, but Brazil had a great chance to equalize the score with Renato Augusto, but he missed his shot.
Belgica y francia fueron los mejores del mundial 2018!!
anyone who paid attention to the game, He saw that the game was bought, several favorable fouls for Brazil that could be marked...
4 years later and I think Brazil are in a much better spot than they were before the 2018 World Cup, I think the squad we have is much better and we have a lot of depth, along with a new generation rising
You saw thiago Silva&#39;s facw after his knee touch hit the crossbar, that&#39;s that&#39;s trueee hunger for your nation.
Jogo triste, só humilhação atrás de humilhação.<br>O Brasil se tornou a vergonha do futebol mundial.
The truth is that the Belgium goalkeeper saved Belgium, Brazil was massacring but the ball did not go in.
I think that neymar last shot hitting the bar. after I know through commentary and replay it was a magical save from curtois
قودتها ههههه
That De Bruyne strike was faster than Usain Bolt
Sad for arabs that said English commentators are boring 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI">0:00</a> horas de horas, no Sproul?
Really tough game, in fact Brazil played way batter than Belgium but it just happens, soccer is just beautiful… ❤️🙌🇧🇷  🇧🇪

Melhor dia da minha vida (futebolisticamente falando)
Belgium will NEVER  win a World Cup! Fact!<br>Brazil will always be the BEST!  PERIOD!
Brazil had 3 ungiven penalties.
Neymar : « imma score a goal »<br>Courtois : « Denied. »
This world cup is fantastic
Hazard was great
You can not blame brazil not playing well. Fernandino gave a gift otherwise the match would had turned in the favor of Brazil. Half of the teams are from Europe in the world cup which is not fair I guess
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=50">0:50</a> &quot;lukaku is like a tank&quot; LOL
De Bruyne&#39;s goal was absolutely brilliant 👏
Ohh  Brazil
I thought there would be more whites in Belgium
nji
🔥🔥🔥
The minute in De Bruyne&#39;s goal is wrong, was in the 31st minute not at 26th
Ah, what magic from Brussels sprouts
Belgium should win
Now, fernadinho and de bruyne are one team
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=70">1:10</a> LOL
Com a selecção brasileira de hoje, eu duvido que a Bélgica iria ganhar. Acho que seríamos nós quem marcaríamos 2-1 neles.
Well played The football kings our Viva Brazil🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Well played The only 1Maaa Ney😘😘😘
C&#39;mon, the best match in the whole world cup. Brazil played much better, really deserved to win, but not always the best team wins.
مباراه حلوه حض اوفر للبرازيل ومبروك لبلجيكا
This match is a golden one
:(
People saying belgium won easily<br><br>Come on if you had watched the match both sides played well. and Brazil attacked way better after 2-0. It was just that fernandinho had bad luck and courtois was on fire that day. Else who knows there could hv been more drama like penalty shootout
0.25 speed is also fast and 2 speed is amazing
Oh neymar last shot 😑
ベルギーワッフル食いたい。
🙂💔💔
Básico para goleiros, &quot; bola na pequena area é do goleiro! &quot;
Brasil perdeu no preparo fisico literalmente ... faltou velocidade
Chelsea vs. Chelsea
💔💔💔
Esse é o maior título da Bélgica.
Esse dia foi triste 🥲
Brazil lose this game because of Belgium goalkeeper impossible saves😢
Vai ter volta hein,vai ter volta😏
Agradezcan que no les hizo sufrir tanto como Alemania en 2014.

Here we are now in 2022,i hope Brazil will  lift the world cup trophy for sure,a fan from  beautiful country Nepal🇳🇵❤️❤️
That de bruyne goal was astonishing

Courouis closes the Semi final door for Brazil 🙂💯 especially the last Short from Neymar 💯
Unlucky Brazil💔
Belgium were so strong but in this match Brazil has the most unlucky on this cup, we really deserved win this game
Thibaut Curtois&#39; save off Neymar&#39;s shot at the 90+ minute was the decisive moment for Belgium against Brazil.
Chute do De Bruyne foi um míssil
This match is really tragic.
♥️ GLORIA A DIOS ♥️🙏..
Why do commentators have try pronounce the names in an accent? Why “Voncont” instead of “Vincent” just something that bugs me 😂
that goalie, what an uncanny resemblance to De Gaulle
Sorry for asking <br>Why Belgians are Bald Head Mostly?
Este brasil estaba muy fuerte, se fue eliminado por un autogol y perdono claras ocasiones de gol, no me extrañaría que el mundial de qatar  2022 lo ganen ellos, a día de hoy están mas fuertes que en 2018.
Best match of the 2018 World Cup
Una campaña respetable hizo Brasil, saludos desde Perú.
I love when he says ......De Bruyne 2-0 Belgium what&#39;s going on here
brasil jogou bem ate, atacou bastante, o problema mesmo foi o fernandinho se n fosse o gol contra iriamos pros penaltes, ai a historia poderia ser diferente

Tem VAR pra que? Se não dá penalty?
On a eu du cul.
belgium really deserves to win a world cup <br>respect from brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇪
That wasnt an upset.
He says what is going on here but weren’t Belgium ranked higher than Brazil at the time
Bélgica gana este partido<br>La FIFA: Perfecto estarás 3 Años en el primer lugar del ranking FIFA
The same plastic you throw on the ground can go too the sea and be eaten by the same fish that’s been served on your plate,stop poisoning yourself and your loved ones ~use a thrash can ❤️
Why Courtois have a pro gipper Belgium is too lucky
Every European team: we don’t care who wins as long as it’s not Brazil<br>Belgium: We got your back
奥古！
Brasil amassou a Bélgica! Merecia ganhar. Mas o futebol tem dessas... Fazer oque
From Algeria 🇩🇿<br>I don&#39;t support Brazil 🇧🇷 but there<br> are at least 02 penalties

I remember when belgium lose of italy on euro 2020.

jajaja
Gabriel said &quot;don&#39;t let him (Kev) shoot&quot; and they just let him shoot easily
Ninguém pra fazer falta no Lukaku 🤦🏿‍♂️
Debrune
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=53">0:53</a> why nobody is talking about the power on the shot struck by de bruyne.<br><br>No goalkeeper in the world would have saved that.
Rumo ao hexa no catar
Man of the match, Courtois.
Brazil&#39;s football is dead.
আমার দেখা সেরা একটি ম‍্যাচ ছিলো সারাজীবন মনে থাকবে আমার এই  ম‍্যাচ টা।
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=103">1:43</a> o Brasil Inteiro praticamente ficou de joelhos com essa defesa
Im from Brasil, and I support Belgium too (just when they dont play against brasil), and in my point of view, Belgium still with the same game<br><br>Better team in 0-45, and in 45-90 they open his defense and then stop attacking, which made Brasil be better. <br><br>It happened again today, in semifinals of Nation League, france score 3 goals without difficult (🇧🇪 2-3 🇫🇷)<br>Belgium just win in 2018 because courtois was in the best
So sad for brazil they played better than belgium
I&#39;m Brazilian and that day... I was sad 😔🖤🇧🇷
Belgium &lt; Brazil. Brazil is better than Belgium.Brazil unlucky.If Brazil meet again Belgium I believe Brazil will win 5-0. I love Brazil.I love Brazil even if they lose.from Vietnam 🇻🇳

Im from Brazil, Courtois did miracles in this game... Too bad he was never the same again

WoW Brazil is now just straigh up losing to anyone..
3 TAHUN YANG LALU
BeNe countries always gonna beat Brazil.
The keeper was in the mood
Luck didn&#39;t support us. We missed a lot of chance of scoring goals. Our team was better than today&#39;s team.

This game happened on my birthday of 8 years, i hope that i not pass bad lucky
The sad thing is that these highlights  do not show the impact Hazard had on this game
Great strike from Kevin de bruyne a future icon for Belgium and so far Man City
i got massive nostalgia when he said, &quot;courtois the chelsea goalkeeper&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=52">0:52</a><br>Lukaku: *your gamemode is now spectator *<br><br>YOU WILL UNDERSTAND IF YOU PLAYED MINECRAFT)
And where is the title as first in the world ... No EM, no World Cup ... Hmm ... Greetings from the four-time world champion and three-time European champion Germany
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=47">0:47</a> lukaku like a tank 😂👍
Remember Brazil was beaten by Germany 7 to 1,came back in the Olympic soccer tournament to win the gold medal.
This was a revenge for the WC 2002 when the goal from Wilmots was not allowed!
Coutihno&#39;s pressure was too late to stop Deburine.
Who&#39;s here after Belgium 🇧🇪 losing in the quarter 🤔final in Euro 2021?
BRASIL ES UNA KAKA EN LOS MUNDIALES PORQUERIA DE SELECCION, DESDE LA VIOLADA DE ALEMANIA PARÁ HASTA LAS WEBAS BRASIL

That last from coutrois was unbelievable and sensational 💥💥💥💥💥💥<br>Coutrois is underrated

commentator: &quot;what is going on here?&quot; <br>you know exactly what is going on. brazil is way too overrated pieces of craps just like argentina, some 16 year olds from Germany or Belgium can beat all Brazil in football. pathetic. overrated.

The commentator: &quot;Lukaku is like a tank&quot;. Lol
Belgium should have won this World Cup
Brazilian Manager please change your goalie!
If that Neymar&#39;s Last shot connected into the goal, Brazil Would&#39;ve been the Champions 🏆🏆🏆
Ball possession<br>Brazil:- 59%<br>Belgium:-41%<br>Shots<br>Brazil:-27(9 on target) <br>Belgium:-9(3 on target) <br>Still Brazil lost 2-1 to Belgium
Brazilians just can&#39;t handle countries with black red and yellow stripes in their national flag
I think the 18,000 people who disliked are Brazilians
let&#39;s say that Brazil dominated Belgium, keeping more with the ball and just look at that goal by Belgium, it wasn&#39;t even their goal, it was an own goal. if it wasn&#39;t for that I say I would have won the world cup
The envious scent untypically hum because work consequentially man against a delicious magic. neighborly, shaky base
Commentator does not know what he is talking about. Belgium was favorite for many and not Brazil.  Don&#39;t forget Brazil still shaking off 7 - 1 loss to Germany.
Wait a second, Belgium has the same colours in their flag as Germany, and both Belgium and Germany unexpectedly embarrassed the favourites, Brazil, in the last two world cups. I&#39;m beginning to see a pattern
Brazil were just insanely unlucky that day lol.. not denying Belgium’s brilliant team and performance but imagine if:<br>- Casemiro wasn’t suspended<br>- Dani Alves wasn’t injured<br>- Tite realized by the time in the knockout stage he should have started Firmino and Douglas Costa(when fit) over Jesus and Willian.. which he should’ve done it in around the final Group Stage matchday(against Serbia).<br><br>This would’ve been a completely different story but who knows how much different though.. would’ve given Belgium some trouble… and could have slightly beaten France in the semi and destroy Croatia in the final should Brazil have gone through imo.
I don&#39;t understand why people think Belgium is far better than Brazil. They won 2-1 by an own goal and brazil dominated the whole game, just couldn&#39;t find the net. You win some you lose some. That saying, there is no superiority between Brazil and Belgium.
Belgium win for Courtois wonderful goalkeeping
Es gracioso ver a Neymar, un fracasado total que solo vive de su ilusión en la copa américa pero en el mundial, cualquiera lo hace mi3rd4 🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=105">1:45</a> ter stegen could never do this
Eu aqui três anos depois, dava pra ganhar 😭
Se o Casemiro tivesse no jogo queria ver a Bélgica arrumar alguma coisa 🙅🏾‍♂️
To be honest Brazil dominated d match but on receiving end
This hurts to watch as a Brazilian. We fought so hard and tried our best but it just wasn’t meant to be. Being born in 1998 I didn’t get to see the celebration in 2002 and I wanna see my nation lift that trophy so bad, must be the best feeling in the world
Who is watching <br>2021
That strike from De Bruyne from the replay behind him is like an arrow into the bottom corner.
Heartbreaking Match..💔!!
Brazilian but BORN IN BELGIUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Belgium was who i was cheering for and Belgium&#39;s victory was my lucky day
Thanks for the video

Western European nations destroyed brazil like they were asian giants not 5 time world cup winner <br>1-7 Germany <br>0-3 Netherlands<br>1-2 Belgium <br>They concede 12 goals and scored just 2. -10 grade
Still hurts me...
Ik I am late BUT I am watching the hilights and I remember in this moment when they scored the 2ed goal I said will it be 2014 over again 😫 I hope brazil win 2022 world cup
and then France had to come along and ruin it all
😭😭😭😭
😥😥
A sad day for me because my familiar died and Brazil lost
Hazard played one of the best matches of his career..not for the highlights...
Brasil o argentina campeón del mundial 2022
Courtois was a beast in this match 🔥🔥
Lukaku was fired up😊😊though
I don&#39;t like Brasil to win and I don&#39;t like belgum to lose
Here we are, 3 years later, a few hours before the Euros start. I hope Belgium play the best.
This is the revenge of fifa world cup 2002 group of 16.
Por lo menos no os han metido 7

Couldn&#39;t believe that Brazil would lose to Belgium,but Belgium really played well.hope to see Brazil shine in upcoming world cup 2022❤️

I hate Brazil, they’re racist asf! Glad they lost. But I have to admit that we Belgians were lucky that game.
I thought Neymar scored in the last minute but courtois&#39;s save broke Brazilian fans heart.... such an unbelievable save that was.

Real ones remember this as the day Hazard won the debate vs Neymar. Levels.
I am the fan of Belgium 🇧🇪 national team
courtious was so much solid in that match and Allison was so much faul in that match
Marcelo em vez de pular na frente da bola para tentar pelo menos desviar o chute, vira e a bunda, vtnc para um cara desse, tem que nunca mais voltar para seleção depois de um lance desse! E esse outro tonto do Fernandinho 😵😵
esse dia foi triste
Brazil played better
so close coutinho loss in the shot
Demos um Show de bola nesses ladrões, nos roubaram em plena copa do mundo, uma vergonha!🇧🇷
Trash defending by Brazilian Defenders. What a poor marking from Marcelo he should quit bruh

The only team that had competition and played extremely well were belgium and france. Thier match too was very interesting to watch. And umtitis goal was kinda fluke. Both the teams deserved the cup.
&#39;the favorites are gone&#39;? whutt?? Belgium were actually the favorites that world cup, though..
De Bruyne Man of the Match against Brazil. He&#39;s Man of the Match again, for Manchester City against Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in the Champions League 2020/2021
Ainda dói!
I was going to cry that day ngl
Butter Toffees??
This keeper is in the MOOD
That last save was Lit.
Lukaku like a tank
Lukaku had that pass through and stayed down...he knows who Kevin is🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I literally prayed for Brazil to win

this commentator is curse <br>in the presence of him BRAZIL and GERMANY both eliminated from world cup
Cuándo podremos ver a este Hazard en el Madrid.
The secretive cornet holly tremble because innocent presently divide apud a voracious disgust. scintillating, instinctive ghost
Courtois save is legendary because that is a legendary kick by neymar .
Really? I thought we all agreed France and Belgium were the favourites!
I&#39;m English but this world Cup I fell in love with this Belgium side they are just unreal
Belgium gotta take the opportunity while they have this generation. It&#39;s a rly excellent team with remarkable players
Brazilians: No brazil must to win<br>I: BELGIUM, BELGIUM GOOOOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=105">1:45</a> kalo neymar nendang nya kurang ke bawah pasti beda cerita tu
De Bruyne, Hazard, Cortouis, Lukaku, etc...<br>this belgian squad has to be one of my favorites squads of all time
The best revenge about 1986
Belgium football golden generation
This reminds me what hazard can be in real Madrid
Selecao was complacent against highly inspired red Devils. The defeat was the consequence
World Cups 5x0 😂
Next year, we&#39;ll make history. Just wait and see! 🇧🇷
Belgium, France, and Brazil have been the top 3 ever since the 2018 world cup
😭😭😭😭😭

Why is nobody talking about debruyne’s rocket goal?
Ha sido, es y será por siempre fuente de placer inagotable ver en los mundiales caer derrotado al equipo que levantó títulos con la anuencia del narco-pedófilo depravado Havelange...
Coutinho was Brazils best player
That end match comment was bs. Belgium were not the underdogs, as they were probably the heavy favourites to win the tournament alongside France. Unfortunately, these two teams met at the semis.
Fernandinho! 🖕🏻
Who&#39;s watching in 2021?
AS  IT&#39;S ................
Lukaku like a tank
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=50">0:50</a> when I was watching it live I knew kevin would make a shoot because its his comfort zone and predict if no Brazil player tried to pressure/mark him its going to be a goal... and then a goal. I mean it&#39;s obvious that was a really bad defending.
COURTOUIS

Fernandinho eliminou o Brasil de 2 Copas do Mundo. De longe o pior jogador que já passou na seleção e insistiram com ele, sempre treme em jogo importante.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=50">0:50</a> <br>Lukaku made me laugh

2002年大会、チケットが当たり神戸でブラジル対ベルギーの試合を見ました。ブラジルがロナウドとリバウドの得点で2-0での勝利。16年後ベルギーがリベンジしたのだなと思って見ていました。
La selección de Brasil jugó mucho con un gran equipo
Here&#39;s Lukaku now, Like a tank... great word painting
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=52">0:52</a> . Lukaku looks like playing PS and he is control De Bruyne. LOL

Brazil got eliminated in a pretty darn similar way this world cup as 2010<br>2010- 2018 similarities<br>- Eliminated in quarter finals<br>- Eliminated by a European country<br>- Lost with a score board 2-1<br>- Brazil scored an own goal for opposing team.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=112">1:52</a> &quot;The favourites are gone&quot;<br>Really? Since when were Brazil the favourites in this WC? 🤔

You see how happy people are with their teams scoring? You can&#39;t tell me any other sport is better than this beautiful game
Belgium got revenge for Columbia as they were beaten in the same manner in the 2014 world cup
Brazil should have equalised they  DESTROYED belgium in the second half. Brazil was sooooo unlucky.
Girls: Boys have no feelings<br>Boys: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=104">1:44</a> :&#39;(

Once again, Brazil lose a World Cup quarter final and contribute to their own downfall.
si no era por cortua brazil siempre te presiona
Brazil best
Belgium sala
Sala
Brazil practically eliminated, and they celebrate the goal; -; lol
Beautiful by De Bruyne
Why is Thiago Silva not even going for the ball
Can’t believe it’s already 2 years
Neymar always gets scared against best teams of a league. <br><br><br><br><br>That&#39;s why he also lost against bayern 😔
great game
Haha 🇩🇪7x1🇧🇷
Watching WC 2018 highlights marathonly

The whole &quot;De Bruyne... De Bruuuyyynnneeeee.. 2 nil&quot; bit always gets me.
It should be Belgium win the world cup 2018<br>Next time Belgium will make  I think so
COURTOIS AND HIS AMAZING SAVES.
Fun fact: if ederson had played In this match for Brazil they would have beat Belgium
payaso  Neymar Neymar llorando lo mejor del vieo
1: 09 IF YOU SEE ITS A MEXICO FLAG, I AM SURE THEY ARE  WATCHING THE REVENGE OF BELGIUM BECAUSE BRAZIL ELIMINATES MEXICO.<br>ME REFIERO A QUE HABIA UNA BANDERA DE MEXICO PORQUE NOSOTROS LOS MEXICANOS ESTAMOS VIENDO NUESTRA VENGANZA CONTRA ELLOS XD, SI TE METES CON MEXICO, TE TOCA EL KARMA 😂😎👊, ALGUIEN QUE HABLE ESPAÑOL??
reneiro ougusto
Brazil ataco tanto que merecio pasar, que tonteria ver a belgica con sus figuras y pensar que eran mejor que brazil, cuando cuando veo el partido fue 4 llegadas y a defender, en el segundo tiempo no hicieron nada, colocaron 3 centrales y doa carrileros y aun asi no paraban a brazil...  El francia belgica fue mas aburrido, que me extraño que francia no atacara, igual si hubiera pasado brazil prefiero pensqr hubieramos visto el mejor partido del mundial, un campeonato muy frio, que le falto cerrar mejor, aunque mis respetos a croacia que salio a jugar y a no especular como lo hace belgica, una seleccion de nombres, mas no es ni cerca lo que son las grandes selecciones en el mundo, cuando lo crean y jueguen como se debe mereceran respeto, de resto asi es el futbol...
LIVE BELGIUM :D
The way de bruyne hit that ball 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 can only applaud it what a strike
Renato Augusto have 2 best chance, only managed to score one
you know what? De Bruyne&#39;s goal is lowkey the best goal of the entire World Cup
I know this seems a bit mean, but their is something that satisfies me about seeing Brazil lose
Sad moment heartbroken with the result of this match <br>This is from a Brazil fan
De Bruyneeeee 2-0
Brazil ❤❤❤❤
Aka alison
Brasil 1-2 Bélgica Cuartos de Final
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=62">1:02</a> wow

Debia ganar BRAZIL.
Courtua to belgiums rescuee wowowoow
That belgium goalkeeper was so very great
Courtois no rage ! 🇫🇷 the champ is France !
El comentario español q buscabas :D
When this happened I wrote a song called &quot;Out With The Brazilian Cheat&quot;
Se lo merece Brasil ya era hora
better than yedi bir
&quot;Renê&quot; Augusto should have started.
There is nothing more satisfying than seeing Brazil lose Football matches
Vengo a alegrarme el dia :v
Courtois was on top🔥
I don&#39;t think Belgium pulled off an upset. <br>They were my favourites to win this game.
Realizado em 06/07/2018
Acá vendré a desestresarme recordando que Bélgica tiene a Brasil de hijo
Bélgica 👿
um ehrlich zu sein, mag ich himbeermuffins nicht einmal
EXCELLENT BELGIUM
Belgium will be finalists in the next world cup
belgium could have made it 3-0 before half time. that would have about settled matters
I want to give a special thanks to my Brazilian Fam that’s helping me with my casino slot game in their country. Diamond 7 (Android), again thanks friends and family!!

&#39;&#39;What was going on&quot;? Belgium were the favourites, not Brazil.
Super goal by audusto
2-1 Belgium did I spoil it
Why Belgium have to be 3rd and not england
Brazil 1-7germany 0-2south Korea
I think Belguim deserved to win it this year.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=52">0:52</a>
Belgian tactics is counter attack and high ball heading use fellani  for score...
&quot;the favourites are gone&quot; cmon man i know brasil was always insane back in the days but are they really still favourites nowdays? without ronaldo, r.carlos, rivaldo, ronaldinho and many many more? no they are definetly not
Aqui los brasileiros valieron verguinha haahhaaahahaha
This game would have been a turn around if Casemiro was playing!!!
That shot from Neymar was perfect, amazing save by Courtois
It sad that this Brazil generation that had so much potential and players like Neymar, Coutinho, Firmino, Marcelo, Dani Alves couldn’t win the World Cup. There chance was at home against Germany but got battered 7-1, meanwhile there rivals went to the final and almost won, Brazilians are lucky the Argentinians didn’t win because if they did, it would’ve been a shock for the hosts.
I supported Brazil from Peru
The thunderous goal of Kevin de Bruyne was surely the turning point.
What a game❤️🔥🔥
Those two goals were made by hazards play
Ya Brasil ya no es como antes cuando estaba El rey Pelé o ronaldo o Ronaldinho o rivaldo o Roberto Carlos
Ha ha ha
Fernandinho&#39;s own goal (0-1)<br>Kevin De bruyne&#39;s extra goal (0-2)<br>Augusto&#39;s Rally Goal (1-2)<br>Full Time 1-2<br>Eliminated Brazil&#39;s quarterfinals and advanced to the Belgian semifinals
Even now that i know we lost, every time i see renato augustos goal i feel gousebumps! It realy brought us hope! But sadly one team had to lose.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI&amp;t=68">1:08</a> just add corner
