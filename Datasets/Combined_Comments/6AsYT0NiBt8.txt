Logon ki whjah se hi aap famous huye ho aur aaj v unki whjah se hi famous ho...phir v inka pass itna attitude...
Fans agaar kutta jaisa ho to stars kya karenga
After looking at these attitudes if i get a chance  to click selfie with my  best celebrity i won&#39;t even make a try for it . Inke paas selfie khichna matlab Insult ko invitation dena .
Kyu jaate ho randiyo ke paas selfie lene
ARE BHAGOO IN CHUTEYOO KO]
These people have lost their self respect, why are these people disturbing them? If you call celebrity an egoistic then you are also responsible for it. But in India people are mad about celebrities. Running after them like dogs, on the other hand they don&#39;t care who the hell you areüòÖ
People should understand that these celebrities are human and respect their privacy.
I don&#39;t really blame those &quot;Celebrities&quot; ...I blame those PPL who somehow believe that their worth can only be amplified and displayed to the world if they can showcase a selfie with some known personality even if it costs them their self respect <br>..<br><br>Shame
Teri galti hai bhai teri kya lagti hai bhai woh tere liye usne kiya kya hai tu selfie lene ke liye mare jaa raha hai... Jaa ghar jaa kar apne asli celebrity jo tere maa baap hai unke saath selfie le... Unko unki space de do...Inn pagalo ke piche tu pagal matt ho bhai...har koi sushant nahi hai...
Celebrities have their own privacy. Respect that. They are also humans
I have seen only Sonu Sood, the true gentleman besides being an actor
They lead a disgusting life and we are responsible for this making them God or Goddess
Saali ka na sakal na surat
Don‚Äôt understand why people want selfie with these so called film celebrities üòÇ
Aisa hi hona chahiya tum logo k sath q k tum logo main self respect hi nahi hay
&quot;Unbelievable attitude&quot; vs &quot;Simple selfie&quot; üòÇ She has the right to refuse - simple selfie ho difficult selfie

Fans are just mad for these celebrities. But celebrities do their job. Earn from them and then ignore them.
So what she is not wrong they need some privacy that they don&#39;t get it they have every right to have privacy they human after all sorry to say reporters fan sometimes they are irritating very irritating I don&#39;t blame karreena and just because she stands for her right doesn&#39;t mean you make her drunken make her face as it&#39;s on this post have some decency grow up..I support every celebrities in this video enough of public constantly they are on them give them space and privacy
Who is she ?? I don&#39;t know . Why giving so impotance
It is Castrouphobic when so many people come from all sides and especially for female celebrities... It is a threat
People are so obsessed with selfies that they forget celebrities also need privacy.... This girl shouting for Salman Khan.... Someone is promoting her to shout loudly..... <br><br>Then this video will leak and then social media will term the stars bad
They are also tiered  . They are not always in mood to smile take selfie etc ..stop making them look cruel by putting that music in background.
Fan woh g@@n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23u">#u</a> hota hai jo apni poori zindagi celebrities ke peeche laaindi kuttey ki tarah bhaag bhaag ke bita deta hai ....khud apni life mein kuch achieve nahi kar pata ...bas ek keere ki tarah celebs ka p@@d soongh soongh kar ek din marr jata hai
Public kitni ajib behave krti hai ek selfie jaise unki life set ho jaegi unko job lag jaegi shadi ho jaegi aisaa behave kr rahi hain
Kisi ke private space me gusoge toh gali toh khaoge hi

I don&#39;t find any fault of Kareena..when ppl will understand that your self esteem is in your own hand..Doesn&#39;t matter even how big are they  why beg for selfies??.We love to watch movies ,get entertained after long hectic work .That&#39;s it..Put a full stop there...

Selfie kyu lena h?stars nahi h yeh...kaise look aur logo ko chote log aur tum log kitna bhav dete ho kyu
Any Hindu woman who names her son Taimur..... I cannot say here what I think of that woman, but I&#39;m sure you can guess.
This was so wrong. Film stars are also human. It was rude and disgusting  that selfie guy behaved... Jumping in front taking selfie , without so mush so as if you please. <br>I admire Karina&#39;s restraint in this situation
Tum log in logo Ko ignore kyu nahi karte. ye kya bhagwan hai.apni self-respect rakho.

This is where your respect triples for superstars like swargeey Sri Puneeth Rajkumar saab who used to treat fans like his family members. Free food for fans at his place, respectful behavior, having a meal with them, standing patiently for hours together to give pictures to fans.. despite being massive star himself. RIP power star ji. Miss you sir
Yar public kitni chu hai. Mai to ghas na dalu kisiko. Who am I to make someone uncomfortable and then say ki i am a big fan.

that was legit dangerous for Sanjay dutt but if he pushes someone back then make it a big deal. jhanvi was uncomfy but she cannot express it? what nonsense is this
oh yes, they are public property. how dare they refuse a selfie or not allow a complete stranger get into their space. they do not deserve their alone time or a bad mood.

Why the hell you want selfie with them .. leave them alone
Taking selfies is so personal.  Give these people their privacy.  They have every right to be rude.  One must ask respectfully and if they say no than respect it.
People shd not care abt them that&#39;s when they vl call n click pics..they r not real hero&#39;s..teal hero&#39;s t the ones who leave their family and love to save and serve the country..don&#39;t know when people will realise that
Ufff zada atitude dekha rhe ha
I don&#39;t get why ppl r so mad at them? Even if they&#39;re, atleast show them some respect by asking fr a selfie.
I don&#39;t like her because of her attitude not only this video she is

People deify these actors, forgetting they are also humans and it can be irritating for actors as well, continously being asked for selfies everywhere they go. It&#39;s offending for fans as well when  celebraties refuse to acknowledge them. So, people appreciate their art and work, but don&#39;t go crazy behind them because it&#39;s going to give you nothing in reality nor their recognition, nor money, nor their status...nothing.
honestly i respect those actress because they are also normal people not like alien so they also have rights to refuse the selfies <br>kareena was just too tired<br>so never judge those actress
in chutiya logon ke wajah se in logon ke bhav badeh rahte hai, bollywood ki khabar dekh lagta hai communism laga do desh me aur in logon ko labor camp bhej do :D:D:D:D
Cant people just give them some space i mean imagine u are going through this daily even after having mental breakdowns and bad days
It&#39;s not Kareena&#39;s fault. It&#39;s actually people being over dramatic.
u bloody mf. i didnt feel like its a unbelievable attitude. bloody mf wud do anything for likes and views.

You should respect the space whether male /female, actors, celebrities, politicians or US.  Everyone deserves their space.  They will obviously get annoyed mahn!!!  This is not how we take selfies.  We are normal people but still we ask that let&#39;s take a selfie.  So why are the rules different with celebrities . Why to get offended with it? <br>Here, With Sanju Daa and Jahnvi was the limit!!!  Stop messing with the word FAN!  Of course they are because of US , and it&#39;s not like they don&#39;t know this. But they work for it . And if they don&#39;t , then we don&#39;t waste a single day or minute to criticize them.  Why is it so ??

That&#39;s why I love k-pop they respect their armies or we can say fans. I hate Bollywood because of nepotism and some star kids don&#39;t have talent then also they are considered as an actor, model or singer. In k-pop they only chose the people who have talent.

This is silly ! You can take selfies with out her permission but you winge stating she has attitude ! What sort of justice is this !
Mental people they have privacy don&#39;t disturb them
Chi Chi.

Sanjay dutt g ne bola tha ek ek karke
I don&#39;t believe it actors have sense
Enke piche bhagte hi kyu Ho ye sirf movie me hero hai Real hero toh mumma Papa haiii
They too have a personal life....
Trust me or not they don&#39;t have privacy most of time which frustrated them
She is also a human being need some privacy why you people always going over the limit don‚Äôt interfere in there privacy please definitely it‚Äôs a irritating one
ase ase madarchod log randiyo ko itna bhao kyu dete h
üò≤üò≤üò≤
Salon tumlog ki koi life nhi hai! Jeena haram kar diya hai celebrities ka! Aur sirf background music se controversy nhi banti! San natural reaction hai! Inka b din kharab ho sakta hai!
Treating them like God!! Just famous that&#39;s it
Yeah of course she is absolutely right he doesn&#39;t have etiquette that he should not poke his nose in someone&#39;s privacy
People going mad !!
Give them some space . They are humans and you cannot expect them to give you their time , their life isn‚Äôt as good as it seems
This stupid culture f taking selfie without someone permission should be punishable offence...
Chutiya type lage kyu ho sath me photo khichane, mere sath koi asa kare , lappad lagaunga bsdk vaale ko, bhaag bc
I don&#39;t blame actors those people are bunch of idiots,
Roz alag alag logo ke saath pi kar sone wali ye actress ...kyun marr rahe ho selfie ke piche....5-6 crore rs ho tumhare paas to ...tumhare saath bhi so jayengi
These shameless fans have no sense or self-respect.
Just ignore this so called actrors
Some people don&#39;t know the boundaries where and when, how to behave..... They are also human beings with feelings and emotions, we ask for selfie anytime anywhere we see them, but never think there situation.......
Ohh God this is so irritating, Celebs ko kitna irritate kardete he ye media wale specially heroines, kitna uncomfortable lag raha tha sabko
I mean they are drunk right? They are humans too right? Is it not okay for them to have human emotions?
Sushanth Singh Rajput is best among all‚ù§...and great person than these nepotism idiots...encourage ppl who have talent not to these people who have just background not dedication to work

Chutiye log chutiyo ke pichhe hi bhagte h
Without asking somebody why would you take a selfie? Have some decency...
salman was too much. Also the girl begging him should stop doing this. After all he and sanjay dutt are criminals.
Kon h ye fans log jo in chutiyo actors k sath selfie lena chahte h
Arey yaar ye koi bhagwan hai kya .......jo mare ja rahe ho selfie ke liye ......insan hi to hai ......wo bhi nashedi ........kyu bezat hote ho inke liye ........koi self respect hai ya nahi tum logo mei .......
Kutte ki harkat mat kiya Karo

Who the fuck cares about the actors and actors, . They are just the employees like everyone else,
KAREENA KAPOOR COULD NEVER DANCE....THESE INDIAN ACTRESSES I HAVE NO REGARD FOR....JUST LIKE ANY OTHER HUMAN !

But some fans also do to much why to to close for selfie. Why want selfie just take photograph.
Chuthiya people worshipping these druggists.
Kareena Kapoor is the most arrogant actress i never saw her behaving kindly to the fans i dont know what she thinks of herself actually this people who beg for selfie only make them believe that they are so valuable and god on the earth
Bro isma itna over dikhana ki koi zarurat nai thi  üòèthey are also humans they have there private life.. talking about jhavni and Ileana they just felt uncomfortable so they  just moved a side but did not say no to give a pic and sanjay dutt he was full cover with crowd what do u think his reaction would be.. agar koi bi hota to wohi karta bro pls stop make such  videos and about selfie if they say no just move on from there..
I don&#39;t see attitude just ugly desperate people wanting selfies, leave them alone.

Is hero ne ek movie dhadak kya bna di apne aap ko hero samajh ra hai pehle toh ise dekha tk ni btw iska naam kya hai?
I don&#39;t like kareena kapoor she has very attitude
I don&#39;t know why people are being so c<br> clingy and treating them  as a god when everyone is an important and valuable person in himself, but the only things that they don&#39;t realize because they haven&#39;t learn the meaning of the life and how once life is important
G chat le mam ka ...ye log hamare paise se amir bante hai aur hami ko neecha samajhte hain ....
Who cares üò¥
I don&#39;t understand why these people are following them. Celebs are also like us and they are also humans so why should they behave like celebs are out of World<br>Stop behaving like that people and celebs both.
Ppl are crazy with selfe .... it represents a moment of humility
Amazing people..instead of celebrating and taking selfies with loved ones these idiots are running after celebrities intruding the latter&#39;s personal space..they are awesome Indians
There&#39;s nothing wrong they have right to refuse selfie if there mood is not good üòë
She did the right thing. Indian public hi C*<b>*</b> hai. Public ko koi self respect hai bhi ke nahi ????
Saif Ali Khan has right to deny the selfie but stare at that boy, unacceptable.

Love towards your stars is one thing and irritating them going to an another level is a different thing. Don&#39;t you guys think that ?? It&#39;s not an award show or something where they are standing to give you guys selfies. Can&#39;t you see, these people are genuinely irritating them. Going very personal and at the end they say these stars never give us the so called bhav. üôè Please stop putting the other in trouble üôè

Ye bhi insaan hai yaar ye sab logo ki kwahison ko poora karenge to khud paagal ho jayenge.
Sitting home and download how many pictures of whichever person you want
One thing, they will be in a lot of pressure. They can&#39;t drink, can&#39;t have a boy/girlfriend. No private life. And we constantly pound them with looks and judge their lifestyle. What will happen if someone always watches you daily at the corner of the road, you will go to the police station. They can&#39;t even go to the police about paparazzi encroaching on their lifes. üôè leave them alone.
Why to give so much importance to these charazes actors, Instead go and salute army jawans who guard our border
Mujhe ese insan pasand hi hani ese insano ko log q piyar dete he ye log public se itne amir or femas he ye log bhul jane he mujhe Bollywood me se ko pasand hi nahi.
Pagal Arrey maha pagal hai... Log.. They are begging for selfi with these actor.. Seriously...
Ye bade celebrities bhav nahi dete fhir bhi ham log inse milne jate hai or jo bhav deta tha use to is duniya se hi bhej diya kisi ne uska support nahi kiya jo samajh gaya ho like kare

Aare ye pagal log dekho, in nashediyo ke sath photo khich rahe hai. Jab ki vo log bhav bhi nahi dete. Apne asli hero hai jo desh ki rakhsha karte hai.
inke sath selfie lene ka keeda kisme hai bhai????<br>i am staying in Mumbai and seen lot of stars but i never ever run for selfie, autograph and neither i run just to see them... they are normal human being, Infact real me to kuch jyada hi danger dikte hai.. kyuki makeup ni lagaya hota haiüòÖ
MAMAM MEDIAS &amp; their SYCOPHANTIC photographers .
Ppl are so stupid and has no self respect.. Why the hell should ppl give importance to these low life bollywood actors.. They are making money and hve fame is bcoz of the public or else nobody give a rats ass to these ppl... But public don&#39;t understand that. The public has the power to give them fame or not. I have come across tons of timea with big name celebrities at the airports or in the flight or at shopping mall in London or Dubai. Ppl run to them for selfies as if they are some God. I hve never ever gone or will give them importance. They are nthg but joke. For me they are of no worth.. I guess ppl hve lost their self respect... If really ppl wanna give respect and take selfies go for the real heros who have contributed towards the country like scientists and all military men and women they are the real heros who risk their lives for the country they should be applauded and given more respect without any fame or money they stand against enemy lines to secure us not these good for nthg bollywood. I hve taken many selfies with these heros who deserve real stardom.. Long live India and the real heros.. THE JAWANS.

Har waqt app photo lene ke mood me hote ho? Gor se sochna bus ans mil jayega
Jinke paiso se star bane hai unko attitude Sukha rhe hai
Fans hi chutiye hain. Kya mil jaata hai kisi celebrity ke sath jabardasti photo le ke. Celebrity ko had se jyada bhaav Dene ka kaam public karti hai.<br><br>Unko unki life jeene do, tum apni jio.
Just leave tham alone man!!
Paparazzi! Leave them alone
Waste material of bollywood
# BOYCOTT BOLLYWOOD <br># JUSTICE FOR SSR
Thik bolte hai ki iss desh ki janta bewakoof hai .Abhi bhi inn Bollywood walon ko apna favourite actor mante hai
Is logo ko kya itna dikhana he media vale sale kuch bhi kachra dikhate he in nasediyo ko boycott karo pehle
Charsi
Every one talking how cold blooded Kareena is , but just imagine u in her position. You don&#39;t have any privacy, people clicking your pictures without your <a href="http://permission.how/">permission.how</a> will u feel?!!
If they don&#39;t want so ignore them
I am agree with Sanjay sir because they all are surrounded him like nothing
Inko itna log bhaw hi Kyu dete h in jahilo ko
Taking such selfies is not ethical. They have their personal space that must not be violated. Think if we were in there place with millions of fans around n we are in our own thoughts n someone shows up to take a selfie like that. We will also react in our own way
yeh kon hoti hai jo iske saath chabi lene hai
They get paid to make movies and we pay to watch those movies for our entertainment. It&#39;s a complete transaction. Nobody is entitled to selfies with them just because you paid to watch their movies. You didn&#39;t do it for them, you did it for your own entertainment.
Good
Chutiyapa..!!
These re also human beings only....i don&#39;t understand why ... people treat them like a god ......!!!
She doesn&#39;t owe him anything ..
Or dekho inki filme
Ye log hi chutiye hain jo doggy ki trha do kodi k actors k piche bhagte hain
En kutto ke sat kya selfie lena enko ye nhi pta chl kis wajh se rhe h Dane hum hi dal rhe h tbi femsh h sale bhilde makeup ke nipa poti
I guess people don&#39;t care about the feelings of the celebrity, they just care about their selfie which they want to show-off to other people
I feel they should have privacy....like man if she is drunk...then she might want to home ...not cheer with fans...pls stop being ridiculous
Inn nashedi ganjediyon ko to bhaav hi nahi Dena chahiye...
We don‚Äôt understand the meaning of ‚Äòspace‚Äô
she is hiding her face
WTF she need some privacy. They are not paparazzi but papi bazaar
Most of all actors in Hollywood are good. They know hw to behave with fans especially ‚ù§Ô∏èJHONNY DEPP‚ù§Ô∏è
It&#39;s people&#39;s fault not the actors they so pushy
Celebrity&#39;s hein koyi bhagwan nhiüåöbehavior toh dekho in logo ki.
Meko samjh ni ata ki ye log selfie le k krte kya h...krna h to apni life me kuch kro....apne parents k liye ....jinki nazroo me ap upr utho....kiu aise logo se jutee khate ho selfie manng maang k
Public bewkuf hain kareena nahi
Chutia actress, why people running behind them dnt understand
See Salman Khan is half mental and very stone heart thts why I dislike him , kuch actors bohot acche the like vo pehle selfie Ni le rahe the par Baad me lebe de rahe the , par kuch ek no. Ke khsrush like Karina , Salman , Saif they all r Muslims and very attitudinal
You  are so fool guys  that you follow  these over attitude  actress
Hum log  inako celebrity  banate hai  are celebrity  banana hai to apane desh k solders  ko banao........   khan jaize haramkoro ko nahi
I hate actor and actress due to their attitude
And the shocking part of this is when they have completed a film they go out there promoting the movie that‚Äôs what you call begging the same people they‚Äôre treating like shit to spend Theron money to make them rich
Tina attitude kis beat ki public binary yah star nahi banpati

She doesn‚Äôt even look drunk
Why photoshop her eyes red on the thumbnail? Her eyes are not red in the video
Respect their privacy
Jihadi
Bewadi
Haha or delo Bollywood wale chutiyo ko respect
We should teach our children that these people are just actors.  Respect your self respect and their privacy. Dont go crazy after them.They are also humans. Stop begging for a  picture. And let them live their lives too.
Fuck all of Bollywood actress

People need to stop giving these morons more respect than they deserve
I‚Äôm with the actors on this one‚Ä¶ the so called ‚Äòfans‚Äô were very pushy and out of control. You can‚Äôt just assume that the actor is going to take a picture with you and get your phone out and stand next to him. You need consent.
That girl asking for picture with Salman,itnaa time apne maa baap ke respect par kar bekuf aurat,pls pls pls beg you bol kar yeh toh prove kar diya how desperate and hopeless you are shame on shameless fans
What sort of idiots,do paise ke bikhari fans hai,rude behaviour by lafandar fans

We are the idiots who make them famous despite the fact that they are already nepotistic.

Take selfie with your parents. Not with celebs. They in fact wait for your selfies but we don&#39;t care usually.
Bhenchod tuney title hee ajib dala hai Drunk Kareena... Bhosdike jub tu Drunk hota hai or koi anjaan akr chipak jaye tujhe selfie selfie krke to kya feel hota hai!

Have some sense, Invade your neighbour&#39;s privacy and then talk. Making a scene of it as if it&#39;s a sin ü§£
They go around wagging their tails and tongues out..real scum
Why are people obsessed with these celebrities? Live your life and let them live their life .. they don‚Äôt have to take selfie‚Äôs with. You and you can choose whether to watch their movies or not .. exercise your right to choose!
Education: seek permition for selfie. If the person don&#39;t want to respect that.<br>Wait, <br>Why to take selfi with an unknown guy??ü§îü§î<br>Because you are stupid!!

Respect their space and ask for the selfie first instead considering them as public property and then complaining about it. They are humans too üôèüèªüôèüèª<br>They get crowded and harrassed at times too..They are looking out for themselves mostly. I hope we all understand this and not belittle anybody like that ‚ù§Ô∏è

Unko bi thra space de do itna irritate krte ho aur fhr sensation vi banate ho
They may have a lot of problems to deal with. could be a bad day, or busy with something sensitive. You don&#39;t shove the phone up there first, you ask for permission first, dumb fan got the order wrong when he was busy trampling all over her privacy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AsYT0NiBt8&amp;t=215">3:35</a> girl is so good whats her name she also allowed for selfie.
When you want a selfish you beef to ask consent. They are also humans
Whos the one with her in start in black nd red outfit ??? Shes prettier than kareena
celebrites also feel tired and try to be good to you but not always you can stick at one thing. respect them bruhüòëüòë
I understand some were being disrespectful like Salman but celebs need privacy to their humans too
They are also human beings they are not puppets.
Are logo ko bhi aisa nhi Krna chaiye ,sb ki life privacy personal life hoti h  ..
But  sushant aise nhi theü•∫
This generation actors &amp; actresses have become completely worst.<br>Because they are depressed with the lifestyle, some are drunk, some are obese, some are complaining in nature. That is not the way to live. They need to deal with all matters. <br>How come all actor like dharmendra, big b, sunny deol, Bobby Deol etc are living and leading this way of lifestyle. Whatabout others? <br><br>So i would recommend that an actor should be loving, caring, sharing, friendly, respectful, bravery and also they should have a physical routine which will really help them in their future.
She just didn‚Äôt look she is a human too
Akshay kumar Or sonu sood ko 60d kar agar koi bhi actor mere saamne aaye toh mai dekhu bhi na
Had hoti h yarr pata nahi log selfie ke piche kitne pagal ho jate h ki apni jan ki bhi parwah nahi karte yarr wo insan h bhagwan nahi

These ‚Äújournalists‚Äù harass them , invade their personal space, ask them inappropriate questions and call them rude üôÑ
Really true
Guuh khaane wale fans...
Dear paparazzi you should analyse first before quoting any caption, it&#39;s a bloody selfish act to gain views and gain maximum audience engagement, you it not her it&#39;s you who&#39;s selfish and it happens because artists don&#39;t rebel for what media platforms write about them so you should feel lucky and thankful that they take everything inside of them so that you people can earn, n un logo ki izzat karna seekhon pehle wo jinse tumhare dhande chalte hai and dusre wo jinke kaam tumhare ghar kaa ration bharte hai, inse hee tumhare Ghar chalte hai or inhi ko defame kia jata h, ofcourse fan k point of view se it&#39;s rude but for them it&#39;s normal cuz they get same situation everywhere they go, but they have to look after themselves too n other things around.
This is how media platforms ruin the image of an artist, comon guys you have to understand they too are humans like us, I&#39;m not all a fan of kareena kapoor but this is awful paparazzi make stories on their actions according to what they think would be better for their channel, Despite of these people have all the luxury still they can&#39;t enjoy to the fullest as they have to think about paparazzi and how are they gonna portray the image in front of audience, secondly she&#39;s a female so she has all the fuking right to maintain safe distance doesnt matter if he or she is a die hard fan or living legend fan, bullshit i pity on them sometimes, <br>Just think if that happens to you where you were trying to safe yourself from intruders but next thing you hear about you is awful that you were being flirting with intruder and you wanted to touch him so you&#39;ve pushed him back and this proves you are a nymphomaniac, so this way you cannot even protect yourself cuz if you do so or if you push back will lead to your character assassination.
Bhai rukja nhi pategi wo

I used to work at a coffee shop in UAE Katrina kaif came there she was very down to earth. She don&#39;t think herself too high up
I think kareena was tired <br>But what happened to Saif üò≤
Leave a start, any body who is drunk needs a space to sober down. It shows how much you truly respect na star or a person, that you just need your selfie and not understand the importance of space.
Saale ye log inhi logo ki wajah se star bante hai aur inhi logo ko ignore bhi karte hai Bho,,,,, isse acche to south ke star hai jo sab se pyar se pesh aate hai aur movie bhi dam dar banate hai
Public platform pr ye sare log Bhagwaan dikhte h but asli zindgi me insaan bhi nhi h
Trying to taking a picture with anyone without their permission is not cool. Why would they be ok with it... Ask them... Then take out your phone they may give you a picture... They are not always in a mood.  They are just actors... Not god.. your life is not going to get better by taking a picture with them ... They won&#39;t even remember who you are when you have invested so much time and energy in a picture.

Ek insaan ko jo sabhi gher le GE to aadmi hor kiya kare ga
Ek din jarur aisa aayega jab in celebrities ke Saath koi selfie  nahi lega because people would understand by then that they are just human beings like us.
Ye log koi God nhi jo inki ijjat ki jaye ye log aaj jo bhi hai hum public ki wajah se hai
Why people give important to such cheap celebrities take selfee yourself not with other I never want to take selfee with stars. Everyone is good n beautiful in their own look
Muje to kuch galat nahi laga. Ab wo bhi irritade hojate honge. Or ye channl wale paise kamane ke liye kuch bhi upload kardete hai
They are just tired and they also have there own privacy we always go there to take pictures just for becoming famous from actors , they are have there privacy respect them ,  and yeah we all are incomplete from it actors are incomplete from there fans and fans are incomplete by there idols (actor) that&#39;s it respect them also they also have there privacy ..
In kuttio ke bare me na charcha kare to behetar hai lekin Indian media to kutta se bhi  battar hai shame shame.

lucky that u didn&#39;t have to deal with Jaya Ji
what? she can&#39;t have her own chill time, her own mood, her bad day??? she was greaceful enough, people irritate them till the last limit
Actually I feel sorry for the actors here. That&#39;s a heavy price to pay for their celebrity status. Constantly being hounded by people.

They need their space‚Ä¶.. why does the media make a big deal about them being frustrated while the media falls on them like rain‚Ä¶. We r all humans and need to respect each others privacy. Nothing wrong with them being rude‚Ä¶.. give them a breather.
We love Modi
Sanjay Dutt didn&#39;t do wrong. The people crowded him like morons so that is what he could do and Salma khan is no more the big bhai character rest all did their acts on purpose in attitude
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AsYT0NiBt8&amp;t=328">5:28</a> he did nothing wrong
South actors so gud ,yeh Bollywood wale zyada natak kartey hai
What‚Äôs wrong with these ppl, going behind n torturing celebs, invasion of privacy!
Even celebrities need their space and privacy. This sort of behaviour of stepping into personal space isn&#39;t acceptable. If the actors feel like they will come up to the public, the public needn&#39;t force themselves on the celebrities. If one gets to see them in shows and movies, that&#39;s enough.
Who needs them. Stop watching shit Bollywoodüò†üò†üò†
I don&#39;t known y this public is going so crazy behind them they are simple humans who earn from our money. It&#39;s because of us they are so arrogant once we stop watching them they are disappeared.
She didnot say anything however instead of ignoring it would be better to seek excuse for being in a rush. Treating someone like shit who might treat your film like shittiest thereby costing you ur life.üôÇüôÇüôÇNot wise at all!!
No these guys take things too far... <br>They encroach their private space
I&#39;m not her supporter or anything but she&#39;s a human too. Why can&#39;t fans and media respect celebrity&#39;s privacy. Like imagine coming out of your house and facing hundreds of flashlights and people. And she can&#39;t be happy every single time. If someone&#39;s not in the mood that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re rude. These youtube channels are just too much. Don&#39;t believe such clickbaits and overdramatic videos. Because you&#39;re not in that situation
Youths are really being deceived <br>The so called stars are just acting and making money
Don&#39;t give that much importance to these people they are not fit to be called as hero and heroines   their real and reel life is completed different
All this Arrogant janvhi was the only actress was down to earth
Kareena Kapoor always Arrogant nothing new
In India why the actors or actresses are treated like a god <br>They are just hero or heroine only in films not in real life<br>So worship the real heros.

And they are human beings too who need some personal space. They cannot pose for you every time.<br>Imagine you in their place, you as a female celebrity and some random stranger guy comes close to you and takes your picture. Obviously will be afraid and scared. And also you cannot hit the person, as a celebrity paparazzi will ruin your reputation.<br>So atleast you can say no.<br>And people say that you are showing attitude on being a celebrity. <br>Wow! Superb. üëè
They are human beings too. Admit that they might be rude to people but imagine that you are coming out of restaurant at family and suddenly many people come and take your selfie without your consent, how will you feel? And this happens many many times with celebrities since they are famous. But they also wamt to live life like normal people, have some comfortable space for themselves.<br>So this should also be considered.<br>And you cannot ignore the fact how annoying media and paparazzi is in India.<br>Everyone have their rights so does actors. And I hate them equally as you guys do. I despise Karan Johar and other nepotism promoting people.<br>But bro they also need some space.<br>YOU CANNOT EXPECT THEM TO BE POSE FOR YOU EVERY TIME. Maybe they have some issues or problems. If they don‚Äôt agree to pose, simply ignore and walk away.
They are totally useless iconic personality
Yrr...just think about it ...when u r not feeling .... But others were clicking ur photoü§ß
We are fool because we make them stars and this is how they behave with us. Aur pagal ban jao celebrities ke liye...aur baad mein rote baitho
Public is stupid ..media is like beggars.....mam man karena mam...maaaaam...
1000 selfies with smile and 1 mistake and now they have attitude but they don&#39;t have anything like privacy .
Ya we troll them on social media , and take selfies infront of them and don&#39;t respect there privacy . And some people are comparing them to Korean clebs let me tell you no celeb can stop in middle to take selfies not Korean not Indian or any forener just the difference is that Indians  say that they have attitude we have made them and all but fans of kpop will say that let them have there privacy .
It has two sides I know that they shouldn&#39;t show attitude but place yourself in there place . No one ask for there consent before taking pics I mean consent is also something and always cameras I mean you can understand , they are also humans.
Unki bhi kuch personal life hai. I think they should give them some privacy
What was Sanju supposed to do there, ab tumko 10 log aake chipkenge toh tum bhi yehi karoge, baat ka batangad banate ho, views ke liye khud ko bech diya hain tum logo ne (channel)

3rd grade cheap actress showing off attitude..lucky that she was not slapped back..
They have there own problems they are also humans so they have emotions so its not attitude it was their pain
Seriously guys - i wonder why do people feel so interested in taking pictures with such arrogant actresses? i mean even if i get a million dollar to pose with them i wouldn&#39;t - Indians need to understand that you are the ones making them stars and then this is what you get in return - badlo india walo - they do not deserve such respect - your self respect is much important than running behind these 2 kori ke actresses
Bro public is also rowdy ... they cannot click pics 24x7

Bhai pata nahi kyu in logo ki peeche pagal hai public. Ek baar 150 crore janta inki picture dekhni band karde. Bhai ye log tumare ghar aayenge autograph lene. Disgusting bollywood idiots
I feel so pity for them. No personal life.
Idk why you guys are exaggerating .....she is prolly tired or what .....or maybe just not in the mood .....for a SELFIE if you willüôÑ ......just so you know these actors do have their tolerance level and its not really nice to invade on anyone personal space
Shame on all . Useless .
Public Ki bhi glti h kuch jagah
I will never for the life of me understand people&#39;s obsession with celebrities. It&#39;s because you treat them like they&#39;re Gods that they end up sitting on your head. They&#39;re worth do kaudi.

They are only actors not a hero, original hero is army man
Now a days actor are too much
K apni bhejti Karva kar lete ho
Bollywood singers are more humble than actors
I feel really bad for the actors. They are also human like all of us. They need their personal space too. The camera people stalking them all day all night clicking their pictures should completely be banned. There&#39;s no need for showing them off screen because everyone needs their time off their work.
Shame on bollywood

This is the reason why we should boycott bollywood..
You will understand if you are in their shoes. No one will talk about the 1000 selfies they smiled but talk about the one there were in bad mood. Come humans, we all have bad days

I think prople who taking selfies with them dont have selfrespect..acrually they were ignoring that man...shame on u ppl...they were not gods..stop praising them
Jhootha
They think themselves as God what the hell they think themselves as
Simple logic is that these people are loosing their fans and name and fame with their attitude
Honestly, everyone deserves their space. It&#39;s not fair for people to just take a picture. At least ask their permission first. These people probably make the celebs feel like animals in a zoo. It&#39;s all about respect. Respect them and also respect yourself.
Bhain chod bollywood wale janata ka hi khatte hai fr un ko hi ghamand dikhate hai
Please don&#39;t take selfies with these people ... Without audience they are nothing ....they have not done great sacrifice to country
She is looking so tired.
Garbage is more useful then these so called stars. At least garbage can be recycled or used as fertilizer.
