2005
I was in a big trouble some days ago, my boyfriend of 8yrs and father of our 1yr old daughter continues to mentally abuse me and calls me a lier and cheater all the time and I never have done either. So now I suspect him of cheating then I met a frnd who recommended me to revolutionhacker who gave me access to his text messages, calls and gps location. The bastard was actually cheating on me with some Bitch and I am grateful to revolutionhacker for helping me find out the truth about him. He is very reliable and you can contact him on email at kelvinalanpeterson120@<a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail.com</a>
This song is fantastic!!
Thanks for your help with my Day ❤️❤️❤️💕❤️❣️ 2020

MAH BROTHER WAS BORN ON 2002 :0
This is the best song. Reminds me of my cat who died. 2 years ago. (2018)<br>I once tried to cut myself but the knife wasn’t sharp.<br>Now I stopped trying that. I also wanted to die.<br>Cause the fighting. And deaths you experience.<br>It’s just sad. I really miss my cat. He was the only one on my side.<br>Now we got 3 more pets. A dog, and 2 cats.<br>The dog is the best. It always keeps me happy.<br>I love him. He can bite though he’s still a puppy.<br>But he’s the best. He’s a small teddy bear dog. 🐕 🐶

My favourite song yo
I thought the part, “Oops, I got, ninety nine problems saying bye bye bye” was like, “Oops, I lied, mmm come and say bye bye bye!” 😂
I love you so much and I’m not ciding
Annie I love this but I think you should do it and all I want is that so you can like do it in like games like I have game that I play It&#39;s called gacha life and maybe you could do it there or like any other app that has a game that you can put it on your channel stuff and then we can watch you do it and game mode and I think I would just be a great touch thank you but you can do it if you want to love you the music is amazing keep it up
Hi Anne-Marie!! So I made a song about this but I changed the lyrics, because it was our performance task in math. I hope you&#39;ll be ok about this. Lovely voice, stay strong❤
love anne 💋💋💋💋❤❤❤

You was 11 in 2002, Anne Marie.
I was born September 2003...9 months into 2003...wasnt even CONCEIVED in 2002...dang, so close!!!
I was born in 2008. So I can&#39;t relate!
I was born in 2009😑
I was born in 2002 yeah! Proud af
Why does everyone think this about being BORN in 2002. Its about childhood.
I just loved it. Best song I ever heard. I can&#39;t stop listening to her😍💖💞

Thx Annie Marie for a great song
I was like 4 in 2002 but Sure 🤗
Why it seems like something Ed Sheeran would do?? Really, it was him who wroted the lyrigs of the song??
Haha I love that animated Anne-Marie
.....
I was 11 in 2002 and that was probably the best time for me as a kid.
Why do I like this song?
on the day we fell in love
1999
&quot;The day you kissed my lips&quot; remix:<br><br>This song is very shit<br><br>Lol it ain&#39;t shit it&#39;s just I don&#39;t like it much anymore<br><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tvLIhEaEKo&amp;t=4">0:04</a> is when it says &quot;the day you kissed my lips&quot; 👍
OMG
I was 2006
I&#39;ll take it back to 2002 this makes me feel good. Nice &amp; Nostalgic
I was 10-11 of age in 2002.
I will always remember,<br>the day you kissed my lips light as a feather.<br>And it went just like this,<br>no it’s never been better than the summer of 2002<br><br>We were only eleven,<br>But acting like grown-ups like we are in the present<br>Drinking from plastic cups singing love is forever and ever<br>Well I guess that was true<br><br>Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods <br>And they know mustang where we sang<br>Songs with all our childhood friends <br>And it went like this say<br><br>Oops I got ninety-nine problems singing bye bye bye<br>Hold up if you wanna go and take a round with me better hit me baby one more time<br>Paint a picture for you and me on the days when we were young<br>Singing at the top of both our lungs<br>On the day we fell in love<br><br>Now we’re under the covers<br>Fast forward to eighteen, we are more than lovers<br>No we are all we need when we’re holding each other <br>I’m taking back to 2002<br><br>Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>And they know mustang where we sang<br>Songs with all our childhood friends<br><br>There is more I will continue to add to this)
This is my fave song
🤗
I love this song
