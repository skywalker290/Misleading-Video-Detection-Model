FORTHEMOMENTSTHATMATTER
De cock is the best wicket keeper
Van der dussen ,tristan stubbs and dewald brevis and bavuma are the future of sa . Quinton de kock is the current best batsman but he cant do alone anything as du plessis is not playing 2023 wc too
Van der dussen sixes are ♥️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=220">3:40</a> quick stumping
Miss you faf in csk💛💛💛💛

I was literally watching the session of faf&#39; s batting. I wish SA cricket could have utilised him better. He is simplified classic
Nepal will never forget the ACC contribution to Nepal cricket
My second fav team ❤️❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=282">4:42</a> that catch faf
I love SA cricket team ❤❤
faf is also a one of the good pl ayer for sa but he did not get that kind of honour in sa team
I am watching for faf

South Africa deserves to win a world cup
South africa successfully
Please ab devillers come back for south africa top order really needs you 😭😭😭😭
South Africa batting fledging awesome
South africa played very well in this match <br>I think faf du plesis is very defensive captain like Williamson <br>Sometimes South Africa played Orthodox cricket in world cup matches instead of play extraordinary game because you are playing in world cup matches .<br><br>I feel said for south Africa for another failure in world cup <br><br>I hope they will back in 2023 world cup with solid team and give tough competition to every opposite team <br><br>Love from india ❤️🇮🇳❤️🇮🇳

That&#39;s match is the proof south Africa have abilities to beat world beat teams ❤
Who cares about this win. I’ve been an SA supporter since 92. And we are shocking at WC. Especially this World Cup. It was our worst. And this game just rubbed salt In the wound
This match South Africa performance is good
Plz upload  2015 wcw semifinal match.
the end of sa
How khawaja got out ? 🤔🤔
I love indian cricket team 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Van der Dussen is underrated.
Some great person said once: &quot;All well that ends well&quot;
Tipical south africa 🏏
He came in the era when ABD and Hashim where on the peak of their careers and simply he was overshadowed
Match that caused wc for Australia and India, if Australia could have won situation could have been different 😂😂😂
Nice
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=318">5:18</a> this dude can do anything 😂😂
Let&#39;s take a moment and appreciate Alex carey for his innings
Warner&#39;s hundred was a great knock..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=243">4:03</a> flying 😜 Great
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=180">3:00</a> what happened to Khwaja ?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=119">1:59</a> Faf 🔥🔥 This guy shows consistent performance and he is great
I am a big fan of Aussie batsmen “ DAVID WARNER” and his shots👍👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fad wicket
AUs
Ven der dussen is well good played
South Africa always shows their real quality against Australia
Sa are wasting faf he should defenetly be in the odi side .he is fit and can play for 3 more years I think.they can build a team around him probably.bavuma is not having a set team.
dussen 🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE5JiA77Biw">https://youtu.be/dE5JiA77Biw</a>
Van der also a impressed batsman
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=243">4:03</a> That catch 🔥
Abd ex titan
Warner,s 122 is super batting
Faf du plesis fav player  oll tym❤
South Africa will definitely Bounce Back no problem if the legends have retired the youth will definitely come up...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=218">3:38</a> skills of dhoni😯
SA is always a nightmare for Australia
South Africa &#39;s feliding is always amazing!
Nice match ❤️
I wish van dur dussen was in his early 20. Cause would have loved to see him play the ongoing decade. He is my favourite batsman of SA team.
Pakistan is a best
Love from india.
South Africa you have disrecpeted Hashim Amla in his last cwc why you didn&#39;t add in the team instead of makram we could see the last match oh him
Why khawaja gone
true op bhai bilkul sahi kha
I think SA loves to beat Australia. Even 438  target can&#39;t stop them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=103">1:43</a> Why is Alex Carey standing close to the stumps when a fast bowler is bowling
https://youtu.be/_YJOJ5oCUuk
Where is the wicket of duplesis
I like the way markram plays he is so confident and aggressive
New Zealand ♥️
The bat sounds 💛
Faf du plesis very good batting
warner loves to score against south africa isn’t it?
This was the last match of JP Duminy😢
This match changed the semifinals situations...
Bro but ma chahata tha ki amla uska wc ka last match khela because he was a very great player
CWC - Cook with comali 😂😂😂
According to my opinion man of the match goes to de cock because sent pavilion to both hard hitter Stoinis and Maxwell very brilliantly.
👍💖💝💜💜💝💖👍
If abd was there then it would be 375
Faf duplesis we miss u sir
South Africa . What a match
Rassie van der dussen is best odi test batsman 😀😀❤️❤️❤️
SA the only team in the world cup who find it difficult to win matches but found it easy to win the against the five time world cup champions
thus man threre  thus man there... So 😝😝
this is the last odi of faf du plessis for south africa. after this he was never selected in odi team of africa
South africa is looking incomplete without stey, amla and superstar ABD
Sema match
Fabulous faf hitting back...to..back...🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌😍😍😍😍😍
faf you are my fan and i was wondering why have yo never made a hundred in ipl history
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=220">3:40</a> what a run out I remembered ms dhoni.
5.25 khwaja fir se waise hi out jaise vs India hua tha😂😂😂
Faf beauty with beast✨
Wish aus had won d match,then india wud hv faced England in semi final
Van der dussen 2ñd abd
Congratulations South Africa team but I am unhappy that Van Der Dussen couldn&#39;t complete his century.
South Africa missed Ab devillers Hashim Amla and Dale steyn
Look at England crowd cheering south African boundaries!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=350">5:50</a> ENGLAND???? Australia
Faf🥰
SA is ZERO without ABD. There is no match winner
Kya 2019 wc mein sabhi 10 teams ne ek dusre ke against match khele the kya?
Feeling so bad for vander rassi
Easily was aussies game
The innings of van der dussen was next level
Barring those fugging cancelled matches due to rain we&#39;ve seen really a quality worldcup with many interesting matches..

sa is good play
Awss
What happened to Khawaja , anybody ??
Fabulous innings by faf
Sa continue with decock,markaram,faf,dussen,Miller,phelukwayo,Morris,rabada,Steyn,tahir,standing.

Well definitely one of the best and specially the tough  World Cup matches of all time South Africa always like to defeat Australia especially more in ODI rather than in tests this was one of the tough and likeable match of all time Australia would have also won this match like others but Khawaja who had an excellent partnership with Alex Carey in previous match against New Zealand at London in Lord&#39;s  but this time he got injured so that&#39;s why Australian chances became lower  to win  everybody did well Warner and Carey gave their best with David Warner hitting third century of the tournament right behind Rohit Sharma who is having 5  David Warner hitting third against South Africa but unfortunately all gone in vain as all matches were loss by  Australia faf du plessis and Rassie Van dersen did very well for team having 325 on board and in  reply Australia scoring 315 was definitely awesome nice match               Edit :                                                      Once again Starc - get bold by rabada as Boult against New Zealand.                                                        Starc : I feel it once again that when I get bold how others feel when they get hit by my yorkers😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Faf du your a World Cup hundred is very good bating in World Cup 2019
DAVID Warner is G.O.A.T 🧡🔥
A bad World Cup for South Africa
That stepping out straight six by Du Plessis of Cummins was one of the best shots in the WC
I like the wicket keeping of decok
Sad for ven derDussen💔
Brilliant run out by de Kock
no danm reason of celebrating the century if can&#39;t be the match winner, i really hate warner
Tahir target to complete infinite km in ground
If warner didnt get out then aus would win that
I like faf batting style
If ABD Joins With South Africa Team <br>(1) Auiden Markram <br>(2) Q Decock <br>(3) Faf Duplessis <br>(4) AB De Villiers <br>(5) Vander De Dussen.<br>(6) David Miller <br>(7) Chris Morris <br>(8) Andel Pehluckwayo <br>(9) Kagiso Rabada <br>(10) Anrich Nortjea <br>(11) Thabrej Shamsi
Yaar south africa jeet gai aaur wo bhi aus ke khilaf.
South africa won the world cup in this match by making them play England in semifinals!😂🤙
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=81">1:21</a> Charge! Yes and got him. Took a punch and it paid off big time.
Khawaja absence lead australia lose in semi
Ni cemathc
I remember when SA won the match all Indian fans were excited cuz we were versing NZ and it would be an ez win. But the rain had its own plans.
The catches were sooooo gud sa outstanding  innings
Hi ss
Van der dussen what a great player he is love from india
What a catch by de kock
Where is faf du plesis* wicket
No one is talking about Warner’s amazing hundred.
Pride was all they fought for in this match🔥❤️
Faf du plessis  I love your batting and your  family  and baby  I am van der dussen I  live in  South Africa 🇿🇦
South Africa played well when they are tension free
Sorry no team has scored 500 in white ball cricket
Faf dupleshi kab out hua yaar
Jis jis ko wapas support chahiye like sub karo jaldi💅💅💅
These highlights by ICC make cricket even more fascinating game.
Legends watching 2021😂😂😂
Wow du plessis
India lost the ICC WC because of MSD&#39;s run out
once their teams were ponting gilly warne  from oz and kallis smith abd from rsa and now?
Smith is fav😍<br>Warner is fav😍<br>Australia is fav 😍
Faf du plesis is under rated legend
We missed de villers  in this match
south africa and australia kit colors are matching
Van der dussen ....what a player🔥🔥saw him against england in home series...just so pleasing to watch

Do you love 💕 IMRAN TAHIR
Miss you legend Hashim amla
Good work
Sa 😶😞
X
that last ball shot from van der dussen was so good and inspiring. cummins bowled that short bouncer outside off stump just so that he couldn&#39;t hit it, but van der dussen judged it perfectly and timed his shot well just needed more power.
Marcus stonis should dive
Vander dussen 👍👍❤️
Brilliant contribution from de cock
How can a team like SA with such big names performs that poor in WC... This Match is a example what this team can do..
000001 you missed ab
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=175">2:55</a> someone stop him
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=151">2:31</a>😢

SA missing ABD very Badly 😅🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=81">1:21</a> that shot reminded me new zealand&#39;s mccullum

Very  good batting Faf du plessie
Wish abd and steyn were there
Thank You Faf...
Faf Du Plesis<br><br>World Cup - Through the years<br><br>They say timing is everything in sport. It was timing that didn&#39;t allow Faf to go to England as a Kolpak player and it was again timing that got him a ticket for the 2011 World Cup in India. After marking his ODI debut against India with a composed 50 in January 2011, he continued his good form in the World Cup, notably steering his side to victory in a high-pressure run-chase against eventual World Champions, India.<br><br>However, Faf is more known for running out his best mate AB de Villiers in the quarterfinal against New Zealand. The game was in the balance and de Villiers was set on 35 when Faf called him for a risky single. That wicket changed the course of the game and South Africa fell apart in their pursuit of 222. The C-word was once again thrown around.<br><br>In 2015, Faf scored 380 runs and was only second to AB de Villiers for South Africa&#39;s leading run scorers. Even in the heartbreaking 2015 semifinal against New Zealand, Faf was the top scorer with 82. However, he could not prevent his country from being knocked out as Dale Steyn failed to defend 12 runs off the final over. Another World Cup and another opportunity missed.<br><br>The 2019 edition saw Faf lead South Africa for the first time in the mega event. However, the Proteas had a forgettable tournament as they managed to win only three of their nine matches. Faf, personally, had a decent World Cup with the bat. He was the only South African to feature in the top-20 run-getters list. Faf amassed 387 runs in eight innings, which included a match-winning century against Australia in the final round-robin game of the tourney.
I took the risk dealing with Luiz to be in charge of my trade and finally end up with perfect testimony.his platform is amazing and very straightforward..
Like it ❤️❤️

Nice performance from SA but VDD was so close to complete his century. But FDP completed his century. Australia has also played well but soo close to win.

When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2015 because the market outburst in December 2015 was more than enough for me to have a belief that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading is all about and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market. I invested in some bitcoin that eventually ran out of the market in 2015 it didn&#39;t work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video may last year where I saw some individuals showering praises on this EXPERT KIRSTYFX DEAN  so I contacted him, his trading signals are really accurate unlike any signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my $3,000 into $33,000 in 5days and I was so amazing because I was tired of constant losing of my money.<br>I will advise all traders or newbie to invest in his amazing platform.<br>Here is his contact via <br>Tele gram: @Expert_kIRSTYFX.

Dussen underrated player
Please upload journey of Saturday double header matches in cwc 2019
Quinton de Lock and underrated WICKY
I loved this game despite mighty fall of PROTEAS IN THIS WC AND POST THIS.
How faf gone
Average australian side... Not good enough to retain world title....<br>Previous teams hold record unbeaten from 1999-  2011 <br>Beaten 3  times in world cup after 1992...?
I m happy for faf and sad for varden dussen
Decock well catch
A much needed win for proteas
I am sad off van deer dussen  miss hundred
Hi
Proteas always give to tough time to Aussie in each single match<br>But well-done proteas end with high node
South Africa is my favorite team
No one talk about Carey&#39;s 85
What happened to Khwaja?
and because of this we faced nz instead of england and we know what happened later
Fact :they did not show how faf du plessis got out!
I miss ab de Villiers my favorite batsman this world Cup and full time😢😢😢
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB6xeN-2pko">https://youtu.be/EB6xeN-2pko</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=29">0:29</a> is very good shot
I want tell you my friend 2023 world cup SA 100%
Had Australia won this, they would have won the worldcup easily. They would have faced New Zealand in semis after winning this match.
Markaram for Amla was a better replacement, that changes there match
What the they won hahah are you kidding me
Duplesis 👍 Great player
Hashim Amla and faf at top order, Abd and Miller at the middle order The Steyn gun and Imran Thair at bowling... Imagine if South Africa had this total feature together in 2019 world cup... Winning is secondary but how hard it is to the other teams
Warner played for century not for team. No players celebrate like this when team undr pressure.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_ICxuEtKsg">https://youtu.be/D_ICxuEtKsg</a>
Centuries by Warner &amp; du plessis. Nice
Carey missed his century most underrated batsman
WHERE IS FAF DU PLESSES WICKET IN THE HIGHLIGHTS??
Imram Tahir runing like a cow
for some reason australia beat teams like eng and nz but they struggle against sa i noticed in the past couple of years
Yaar who did not like over celebration of Tahir 1 wicket leta hai aur aaisa daaidta hai jaise worldcup kiya diya😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Fun fact: Faf also holds bat like Sir Bradman <br>Gap between two hands while holding the bat
Did anyone notice that warner scored centuries(in 2019 wc)only against green jersey teams(Bangladesh,Pakistan and South Africa)?.?!
Faf is just underrated

Yes we won the game

Van Dre dussen he is blood in his chest
I think Khwaja got out vs India in a similar fashion against Bumrah <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=323">5:23</a>...
World best player is barber like if you agree
Great Match

Imran Tahir is the fastest runner
Van der dussen is the future of south africa and Alex Carey is an underrated player but it&#39;s true that he is one of the best wicket keeper batsman in present

who is best wicket keeper <br>de kock like<br>carey comment
India is cobra - NZ is mangoose <br>SA is 🦁 - Aus is deer
Sad moment at end of south Africa batting because van der DUSSEN DID NOT complete his century but faf made his 12 century
Feel sad For SA and Specially for my FAVOURITE FAF DU PLESSIS THEIR CONSISTENT AND BEST PERFORMER
Imran tahir after taking wicket: let&#39;s got world tour
Biggest fan of south africa team<br>They are a good team but have bad luck
South Africa performed really well in Odis till worldcup but they slipped there but still faf and ran vanderdussen and Imran tahir performed really well
My team wons. I love south africa
I think it&#39;s fair to say that quinton de kock is the best active wicket keeper out there now<br>Edit maybe butler can rival him
SA cant win under pressure. When they know they have nothing to lose then they start winning but cant win when it matters. Bitter but true.
We will three best players of south africa jp duminy ,hashim amla and i&#39;m ran tahir
Wow
Australia beaten with two teams <br>1.India<br>2.south africa
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=281">4:41</a>

What happened to usman khawaja
South africa team is always lion
Why de Kock is not wearing pads while keeping
Great win by south africa and my fav player faf du plessis completes his 100!
I really wish that Rassie van der Dussen could have hit a six for 101*
If AB de Villiers was in this world cup, South Africa could have reached the semi-finals.
I like Aiden markram..he is beautiful classy batsman...❤️❤️❤️
Please upload the 2015 World Cup  matches sir time is minimum 15 minutes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=69">1:09</a> If Van Der Dussen hadn&#39;t wasted so many balls he might have completed his 100
Africa played superbly in the game but I very disappointed to their poor performance throughout the event.
Bhot. Acch. Laga  soth . africa. Ka. Match
This the south africa we know, and we are looking forward to in the future.
De kock  has also  done a great fifty.He&#39;s so much underrated<br>52 runs,51 ball<br>Not bad
Faf du plasis
Australia has lost its hand .
That was a doni style stumping
How Is Here In 2020 After The Excellent Chase Done By Australia Against England In The Same Venue Where They Lost Against South Africa In Last Year
Hmmm south africa has imoved their game
South Africa also ends in proud way in ICC tournaments but won any world tournaments. 😂
What a wicket keeping by de cock
I guess it was the last time SA played WC, since they will be able to play no more cricket aimed the dissolution of their cricket board by ICC due to SA government interference.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=218">3:38</a> that run-out ♥️♥️
Who love cricket

Abhi Facebook and
I like south Africa after Indian team
De cock had the best wk in this series
South Africa be like hum to dube Sanam tumhe bhi le dubenge
फेक डू प्लेसिस की बेहतरीन इनिंग
<a href="https://youtu.be/a2ij4xb3Or4.">https://youtu.be/a2ij4xb3Or4.</a>. MUST watch - - Pakistan vs England 2001 natwest series thriller match at Lords
Very good runs south africa
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=259">4:19</a> I think if he would&#39;ve ran and dived, he would&#39;ve saved that boundary.
Grant Elloit, Kevin Pietresen , Jason Roy, Sir Andrew Strauss , Jonathan Trott, Colin Munro,Tom Curran These are all south africa players these are all in South Africa Team Means Defenetley South Africa Won World cup Before 2019 World Cup
I wish they had done better in the World Cup. Hopefully they show themselves as a better team whenever the T20 World Cup comes
Why not faf wicket showing
Waovdr
A wonderful win by south africa Iam very sad that vander dussen didn&#39;t complete his century 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
There are 6.5 k dislikes from Australians
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=187">03:07</a><br>Very similar fashion to how Bhuvi got him out , his technique gets exposed for this type of delivery
If and was there south Africa would go to semis
I thinks that in ipl 2020 in UAE Imran tahir go to Abu Dhabi from Dubai
South Africa is very bad team because they have been defeat against Australia then India have to face Australia in semi finals and England have to have new Zealand in semi finals
Always South Africa 🇿🇦 loves to beat Australia 🇦🇺!!!! 🔥🔥🔥 Actually this rivalry started after 1999 wc semi final.
Alex Carey Is find of Australia
Wonderful hundred for David warner
I very well remember I was watching this match at midnight when everyone in my home was asleep I was watching it just make sure Aussies lose this game as india will proceed to 1 rank and all of a sudden my father woke up and sat besides me to see the match and literally we both were so pumped up as it was pp3 and Carey was remarkably showing some great batting display and also hopes of taking Australia over the line but as Morris took his wicket I was relieved but the shot of Lyon really made anxious af bcoz if it would have gone for a boundary Aussies still had a chance of winning it but finally it ended the match as markram took the catch and the Men in Blue proceeded to the top of the table
You can be a muslim

Very nice  performance   South Africa

Revenge taken by South Africa of 1999 WC
Nice vid
If amala or Abe De divillers in sour Africa is the strongest team in the world
Mitchell starc...the best bowler😀
South Africa&#39;s fielding was outstanding !?! 😮😮
South Africa best fielder
De cocks run out though😎😎😎
It&#39;s a great match whenever there is SA vs Australia it&#39;s always be a great match to watch and talking about vd Dussen he&#39;s the next SA hero he had some skills
Nice
Brilian catch teiquen by Q diecuke

Had South Africa played the tournament the way they played in this match, they could have won the tournament. Isn&#39;t it ?
Kas vo haar jaate phir india world Cup jeetjaate
Leaving now and I will call you in the morning and let and see if
this match made us no. 1 and we had to face nz <br><br>how awkward is this<br>same ground 325 and 315 scored<br><br>2 days later even 240 is too much difficult
I have a notice on du plessis he his hiting centurie in icc but he is not hiting in ipl no centuries
mitchell starc nice bowling
<b>Two teams good batting</b>
There is some kind of curse over the South Africa cricket . May be they are under Heavenly God&#39;s judgment for th discrimination against the Black . .
Guys Don&#39;t You All Think Though Australia Is a Toughest Team But They Didn&#39;t Played Any Match Seriously
South afruca khalna pa ay to bari bari team ki baja da
Van der dussen just missed his century
Alex Carey miles ahead of big &quot;flop&quot; show Maxwell.
Lol, SA trashed the so called best bowling attack! Mauled !
I am very sad that van der dussen not make his century 😭😭<br>But I am missing my favorite cricketer 360 batsman Ab Deviliers in 2019 CW Missing so much ab deviliers and SA also missing ab deviliers 😞😞but he was retired in 2019 CW before missing ab deviliers and missing Dale steyn also and SA also missing Dale steyn
I miss world cup it was so thrilling waiting for the next one

Australia&#39;s middle order was not as strong as it used to be earlier.
Very good ending from South Africa 😁
Faf is underated odi batsman

Australia lol😂😂
ABD <br>is the best batman of sa
That&#39;s very very super fast century I like Sun TV
Had Australia won this match , I m pretty sure they would certainly made it to the finals 🙌🙌<br>And probably India would also have defeated eng in semis bcz bcz eng was only side which defeated India earlier , this time India would have managed 🇮🇳🇮🇳<br>And probably we would got to see Ind Vs auss final and we would have won it 💙💙🇮🇳🇮🇳🎂🎂💪💪<br><br>But this match result changed everything but it was a wonderful final and heartbreaking 💔💔 ( NZ 💙💙))
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=81">1:21</a> What a stance 😍

SA missed De Villiers badly at the 2019 WC.<br>Edit: Thanks for 1.1k likes!
Goodbye duminy,Tahir and Hashim Amla
I don&#39;t like the celebration of warner.Worst celebration
When Australia loses from South Africa ( memorable matches)<br>Australia- 434/4 <br>South Africa- 438/9<br>2. Australia - 370<br>South Africa 371<br>3.South Africa- 325/8<br>Australia- 315/10 these 3 matches broken my heart
Fafulous Class.
Imran Tahir wicket lene k baad nanga naach karta h

Bowled him .(Commentary is 🔥)  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=146">2:26</a>
South Africa wins match
Australia south africa se bahot bar hara hai...Recent 2020 mein wo log south africa se odi series hara hai...South africa kisi ko haraye na ya na haraye Australia ko zarror harata hai...jaise NZ India ko...
325 bana ke bhi sirf 10 run se jeete 😂😂 , kya team hai South Africa
Warner tried much , but could not take his team to victory....
SA V AUS is always nail biting
Dhoni who?<br>Watch de cock keeping in this match
south africa team is mangoose and australia team is cobra
They should have payed the whole world cup this way
I love my Indian team
One man can change history-ABD😭😭😭
Steve Smith
Miss a b d
Miss ABD
Imran tahir plz come t20 world cup
Jp duminy is very successfull allrounder to south africa
Dussen missed his maiden century
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=324">5:24</a> lol
Australia is close to win
Sorry for dussain
This was actually a big gift to India presented by South Africa.<br>But Kohli still messed it up in the semi finals 🤧🤧
I will always remember that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=175">2:55</a> &#39; The Tahir Run &#39;
ICC uploads worst highlights
I am from South Africa
I miss Hasim Amla
Who else is fed up with Tahir&#39;s celebration?
Why do we always fucking lose against SA
Pakistan, South Africa and New Zealand didn’t win the cup but left with their heads held high and left on a winning note.
The way Van der dussen hitting six ...am just said Ufffs
SA FIELDING WOW
Wrong team selection for Australia.....another all rounder should have been there
Well done 👍 RSA
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQL_zspkVE&amp;t=220">3:40</a> Dhoni Cameo 😜
When Australia team thinking we the best in the world .that time SA team said hold my beer🤐
Sa is a greatest enemy to aus
Very good match David hit century but he is not able to win Australia and faf 100 but last ball van der dussen hit six but there was a fielder
I love Mr 360
I wished abd was here 😞😞😞
What an inning? Really thrilling.
Once Spain will be hosting cricket world cup South Africa will win it
We want SA back as it was earlier..
If Abd played , then match result will also win for SA but plus runs
SA win this match but too late.....🇧🇩
Whatta keeper QDK....

Remember 2015 world cup.... <br>SA best team 2015 world cup

Can we all appreciate David Warner and Alexander Carey? They both played so well even though their team wickets fall down so easily.
Even though I was supporting Australia, I felt upset for Van Der Dussen he had been playing so nicely he deserved a century.
DipAk...love
