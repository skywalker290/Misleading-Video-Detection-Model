Deutschland über alles!
Excellente cette pub. Dommage qu&#39;on ne la diffuse pas à la télé.
My Sense of Humor is better than all of yours, and im fucking german.

This Vid rocks!
xD im german, and i find it fucking funny. im sorry for this xD
This is not a Volkswagen commercial, in fact VW HQ doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s very funny either, if ever they find out who&#39;s responsible for this, they&#39;ll sue him or her.
So, Germans have no sense of humour? Well there&#39;s is a current VW commercial on German TV showing a group of scientists trying very hard to be funny and failng miserably of course. The punchline: Germans aren&#39;t famous for their sense of humour, but then, who wants funny cars?
Get it.
I love it!!!  The commercial and the car....wish they would bring it to North America
nice!!
