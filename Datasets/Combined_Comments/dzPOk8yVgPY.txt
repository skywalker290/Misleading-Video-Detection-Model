Kashi Bai Priyanka Chopra Is The Best
PRIYANKA JUST AWESOME ... OVERPOWER ALL OTHERS
Every time mastaani speaks I want to barf ü§¢
Two world class actresses in one frameüëè loved this scene
So strong alone. She is in this fight alone, when her husband married another.
Rao ko tumhari zarurat hay!! Kashi was a goddess!!
Movie should have been named after Kashibai, she is the depiction of  true love. Bajirao mastani aur unka bullshit pyar jaye bhaad me. Bollywood loves extra marital affair, male chavenism, polygamy ( uske bina toh film adhuri) . A male cant survive without having fun with multiple women üòÇ. Akal dikha dete almost in every film.
Unne hmara hath pkda hai par aapka chhoda toh nhi... Ky bakwas
Doesn&#39;t matter how childish and innocent she was she acted very mature in the scene to handle the situation. No one Could have done it like PC has done.
Log to bas priyasi ko hi yaad rkhte he
Such a powerful movie with two dynamic women and a deeply tormented man in a triangle. The three lead actors were phenomenal.
I never saw the  love of bajirao and mastani infront of Kashi bhai&#39;s painü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
Agar kashi bai pati ke hote huye dusre admi ke sath sambandh hote to , unpe *crime petrol*üòí ka episode banta,unpe *charitrahin*üòñ hone ka stamp lagta,fir unhe sanskar ki nam pe *mar diya jata*üôä<br><br>     Or , jab yahi chij bajirao ne ki to isse <b>a great love story</b> ka tag lagake film release ho rahi ha.üñ§
I can see in comment section, man are trying hard to justifying their cheating in relationship.üòÇ
PC &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DP
Bruh they can have great lesbian sex and threesomes. Win win
Priyanka‚Äôs acting ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Observe carefully, initially Priyankas&#39; voice scale was up and at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPOk8yVgPY&amp;t=109">1:49</a> she changes it to down she also increases intensity as dialogue demands and again at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPOk8yVgPY&amp;t=133">2:13</a> the voice scale and intensity comes to normal. That&#39;s a acting and dialogue delivery. True actress. Deepika should learn something about acting from her. Total monotonous sound in her every dialogue. Overrated actress.
Arman Malik family ki yad dila di üòéüòé‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
Historically speaking Baji Rao loved Kashi Bai and the marriage to Mastani was political, Mastani had one child and Kashi Bai had 6 to 8 children, the Hindus of those times termed people like Mastani as half castes and treated them horribly, Akbar proposed mughal princesses in marriage to Hindus but they were rejected because non Hindus are termed cast less and half Hindus as half castes.
I think I get it now. Kashi although insulted Mastani by calling her mistress, she basically wanted to make sure that Mastani is ready for more brutal words, she was taking out her frustration but at the same time, cared for her.
Priyanka really done such a heart touching acting with this role üò≠i got tears
Acting so good I don‚Äôt need subtitles
üòÉüßø Kashibai is GEM
If this movie was made in early 2000s, Kashi would&#39;ve been Madhuri and Aishwarya as Mastani. üî•üî•üî•üî•
The movie is called Bajirao Mastani but Kashibai stole the show. üî•
Oh my fucking god. Priyanka has literally eaten this role and both the main actors.
Imagine Aishwarya as Mastani and Priyanka as a Kashibai....this Moment will be Woooow
Hamne to hamari kashi ki love story sunkar bhi unko apna banane ki kasam khai thi aur peshwa ko mastani se bacha tha par aaj bhi hamari life main hamne hamari mastani ko chua tak nahi aur nahi hamse kisiko bacha hey yahi hakikat hey
Priyanka as Kashi is pure love ü•∫‚ù§

lame
Kashibai..,.üíú
Priyanka telling the world who is the boss here.
What was the original dialogue? When mastani says &#39;sindoor jitna jayaz&#39;, she says something else.
Bajirao was a fool to leave a woman like kashi for mastani.
Anyone can translate
Yes it&#39;s true that Priyanka Chopra stole the show but can we also give a moment to appreciate Deepika Padukone.
kounsa dil kaisa dil mannnnnnn
The caption should be kashibai invites mastani in the festival.<br>I believe these are the characters ( real historical characters though but are characters!!)which  had been played in this film by Priyanka and Deepika.<br>So, i believe the  caption must be corrected.üôÇ<br>As this caption sounds really silly !

Priyanka
Remember the script was not written by Deepika or Priyanka. No point bashing/praising them over the content.
Looking at kashi bai it shows how strong women are hatts off
Awesome stars Mastani and Bajirao
Priyanka smacked it! Brilliant acting!
&quot;kaunsa dil? Kaisa dil?&quot; <br><br>Priyanka as Kashibai won me!

Hi
Okaai,  don&#39;t come after me,  it&#39;s my personal opinion. I respect deepika and her achievements but I feel like in some scenes she&#39;s way too stone faced.  I mean I understand that she&#39;s trying to portray a very strong character but somehow I find her acting kinda artificial wheres priyaka looks so natural,  and she can express so much through her eyes even aishwarya in devdas,  something is just pure and natural but I don&#39;t find that quality in deepika,  even in this film,  deepika was great but priyanka completely overshadowed her everytime they were together. <br> <br>Just my opinion üêë
Kashibai ki thilk karnysay hi bajirao ballal war jithy thy because she is lucky for Peshwa bajirao
is it just me who notices that Deepika&#39;s lips say &quot;...Bundelkhand ki iss najayas beti ko PESHWAI jitna jayaz bana diya&quot; but the voice is &quot;...SINDOOR jitna jayaz&quot;
2022... Still here <br>Don&#39;t want any kusu kusu or paani paani
Threy all acted well but I like Priyanka s kasibai tge most.
Kaunsa dil, kaisa dil ....Priyanka just killed this scene by her acting‚ù§Ô∏è
Priyanka.looking so beautiful and her dialogue üëåüèªüëåüèª
Nice acting of deepika
2.53 mein jo dialogue hai sindur jitna jayas bana dia....waha pe Dipika is saying Biswas not sindur that lip is not matching with her voice/dialogue
Anyone else feel like Mastani was talking total nonsense in this scene‚Ä¶people used to marry more than once during those times so it is understandable to have Mastani over there but for her to say UNHONE AAPKO NAHI CHODA,AAPSE AAJ BHI PYAAR KARTE HAI! like what the hell,shut up b***h! Let‚Äôs call a spade a spade! Yes you are the wife,yes he loves you but he had a family back home when he did whatever he did in Bundelkhand and he left Kashi for you!<br>In no ways can you justify what your actions led to and expect KASHI TO UNDERSTAND‚Ä¶.you did break a family and that‚Äôs a fact! Atleast have some respect for Kashi and admit what you did was wrong!
In this whole movie i jst kept watching Kashi‚ù§Ô∏è

Why no one is appreciating Deepika as Mastani ?? She was so underrated in this movie for her acting . At the end of movie I felt sad for kashi and Mastani both because of Bajirao and society both had to face many things

The role of mastani should have been played by Aishwarya rai
Sanjay leela bhansali tried very hard to make mastani a role model but audiences choose real role model called kaashi
&quot;Deepika has flat expressions and zero acting skills&quot; bullshits!! Listen the crack in her voice and emotion coming from it. And of course teary eyes. And yes PC she&#39;s the best.
jst look the way she is leaving from her chamber......it has it own perfection of how a simple marathi girl leaves
she is the person who really know the meaning of LOVE......ofc bajirao and mastani had a gr8 rltn and loved each other........but bajirao and mastani canT love lyk kashibai did in her entire life .........(bajirao also loved kaashibai jst lyk he loved mastani &quot;HE HELD MASTANI&#39;S HAND WITHOUT LETTING GO KHASHIBAI&#39;S&quot;)
According to me priyanka is real hero
Does this gives anyone the Paro meets Chandramukhi scene of Devdas vibes ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®

When I heard  the dialog rahu ko tumari jarurat  he aru  unki jarurat  ka khayal rakhna hamari  jarurat he from the mouth of priyanka Chopra  movement occured in my heart .This    dialog really shows how a wife becomes happy by fulfilling needs of husband  .priyanka way of expressing dialog        what a impressive  and heart touching  .Dialogue in this movie are so meaningful but their message are only become heart touching by the impressive acting of priyanka Chopra. All credited for success of this movie  goes to her.l am your great fan you will not count me as millions of fans  you have but for me you are the best  although millions of actresses over the world.

To be honest, this incident cannot be justified by love, let&#39;s just admit that Rao and Mastani both were full of lust and selfishness. Kashi is a victim who never lived her life.

Sooo how do you feel after getting off all the jewellery from the face.. phew
Bajirao literally deserved a slap after saying that he liked both of them equally like if you loved first then no need of second .Huh?And Mastani don&#39;t she have self respect like marrying a cheater and getting hatred from society if you had self respect you won&#39;t leave place like that.

Self respect is most important. Kashi should have left her husband when she didn&#39;t love him anymore. No one can accept such dishonor . I am glad we are in a time when women will leave their husbands keeping their self respect above all.

What a acting üòçüòçüòç priyanka
The movie should have been titled &quot;Kaashibai&quot; ! For me she was the real hero... Deepika n Ranveer were the supporting stars. Take a bow PC - you were stupendous! <br><br>Dunno why Bhansali doesn&#39;t cast PC as his lead heroine.. She would have totally rocked in Padmavati and the soon to be released Gangubai.
Priyanka&#39;s eyes and her expression speaks louder than Deepika&#39;s dialogue. She was phenomenal in this movie.
Agar koi aur hota tu kashi ka role ko wazan dar nai banapata it&#39;s Priyanka who did it amazing
Shameless mastani!
Mastani and rao are the heartbrakers of kashi
Priyanka overshadow
Why does Deepika&#39;s character feel like she is just reading the script?<br>Priyanka is in another level of acting.
Mastani. Bajirao. K. Liye. Upwastr. Sahi. Payar. Wafa. Kise. Kahete. Nice. ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
I respect women like Kashibai. All respects to Kashibai for real that woman handled the situation so well with the infidelity of her husband. Royal or not she is an inspiration. I cannot say anything as for Bajirao or Mastani because Kashibai has suffered a lot. With three people in a marriage it becomes crowded and suffocating. I don&#39;t pity Kashibai no never she deserves empathy not sympathy and a strong level headed woman like her deserves anything but our pity. Raja ki Rani kehlane layak toh bas aap he thi Kashibai aur koi nahi.
Deepika best
Oh bhaii kya acting krii h reee gajaab bosss!!!!
The movie is basically a story of destroyed family in the name of love. Everything in this world is a choice, including love. Mastani could have a better choice for the peace of many humans including her loved one. She literally destroyed his happiness..as he was already having a wonderful family. Even look at how the story ends!!
Prinanka is write
What Bajirao did was Infidelity. There is no excuse to that...
Priyanka represents all the Indian married women with polygamy... sad part is that both women are suffering and don‚Äôt know whom you can support... really sad part is this situation is still reality in the world.. respect to PC and Deepika..
Deepika was the lead actress but priyanka over powered her with her acting and she changed the meaning of supporting actress

Both women are right in their own places. A person who is wrong is peshwa bajirao ballad
No human on this earth can love 2 people at one time...... Stop this glorified way of cheating
She basically told &quot;dont think about what people will think. Instead, concentrate on your goal&quot;.......
The way she handled the mess
Kaasi ....and her words like sword
In this movie they tried to show the love between bajirao and mastani. And all i could see is helpless kashi...  She is the real hero in this movie ü§ó
Kaun sa dil, kaisa dil aaj ispe aagya kl us pe agya.... Amazing role played by priyanka
Kashi is the best
Bada ehsaan kar dia bhai baji rao ne jo mastani ka haat pakda magar kaashi nhi choda aur mastani se pyaar kia magar kaashi se rishta nhi toda. This man doesn&#39;t deserve love of any ladyüò°üò†
I wish Kashibai and Mastani would&#39;ve been in love with each other, they would make a great couple/company. Bajirao might be a good warrior but he didn&#39;t deserve hearts of these great women.
It&#39;s easy to empathize with Kashi&#39;s character- but it&#39;s remarkable, that most of the blame seems to be directed at Mastani, not Baji Rao. Whether Mastani knew he was married or not, HE knew. Rao knew he was married, but still went ahead and married Mastani, when he offered her his dagger, saying, &quot;Dil toh Peshwa ke paas bhi hai&quot;. Back then, powerful men, regardless of their religion, had multiple wives and maintained harems. We cannot impose our values and sensibilities of today, onto things that happened centuries ago. <br><br>As far as the actresses go, our tendency to empathize with Kashi has a role to play in the general dismissal of DP&#39;s performance. PC did an amazing job, no question- but in this particular scene, watch DP&#39;s face: It goes from a vulnerability and hope, when she sees Kashi with the haldi-kumkum, like, &quot;Oh, is she willing to accept me?&quot;, to a heartbreaking resignation when she says, &quot;Rakhail&quot;. Again, remember, in that day, powerful men had multiple WIVES- they had concubines, too, but Rao called Mastani his WIFE. Given that her role was not the sympathetic one, given that the punchier dialogues went to PC, you cannot deny DP&#39;s superlative skills. Of course, it&#39;s fashionable right now to bash on her because of her political stances or because she might have smoked pot- which, is a ridiculous reason to do that, but, hey- she&#39;s laughing all the way to the bank for a reason!
The line &quot;Rao kehte hain, Mastani tum hamari prerna ho aur Kashi hamari takat&quot; just rubs me the wrong way. I mean if he truly felt that way, why would he not say it to Kashi? And you know what the worst part is, had Rao been more empathetic towards Kashi and spent some time with her as well, Kashi would&#39;ve accepted Mastani with open arms. Such bullshit. I agree with Kashi. Kaunsa dil? Kaisa dil?

More than 1 wife is hardly something new. Take the history of indian subcontinent and most princes, kings and rajas had more than 1 wife. Take even important figures in Hinduism like Krishna and Ram&#39;s father. Only having 1 wife is quite a recent movement in indian subcontinent tbh.

This scene is a prefect example for those brainless people who want polyamory to be made legal. When we cannot manage one partner itself, then it&#39;s impossible to think about another one. When priyanka says &quot;Kaisa dil kaunsa dil, dil aaj is pe kal us pe...&quot;. This sums up perfectly.
Mastani sayibha tum thisra banke ayi ho tho kashi  bai hath bajirao no kis muse chode. ..masthani sahibha apki hat thalvar pakadi hogi par asli yodha kashi haiii jino ne zindagi ke jang jeethi hai vo bhi banjiraoo ki Bina
Is film ki lead deepika ni priyanka thi, usne btaya ram ese hi purshottam ni the unhone apni patni ka darja seeta k alawa kisi ko ni diya tha agr ek ldki apni jindagi shadi k bad apne pati ko de deti h to ek aadmi ko b apna jeevan patni ko samarpit kr dena chahiye

This is a method of acting. People talk shit and compare Deepika and Priyanka, when both are on different levels. Priyanka is on much more higher level. She cares about quality not quantity. This is second time Priyanka has outdone an overhyped actress ( Kareena Kapoor).Deepika is good but she has a long way to go.
Who are here in 2021üòÅüòÇüôã‚Äç‚ôÄ
It&#39;s not a festival.. haldi kuknku is more traditional kitty party sort of thing.. only that women wear sarees
Always men can have many lover üòÇüòÇwomen cant , women should come in the field of scripts writing
Mastani and bajirao were so selfish and devoid of empathy.
Yes but  her ( kashi Bai) culture doesnt permit to fall for other man<br>But Mastani  could do, it was her culture
I like the seane
Wow man I literally cried watching PC üò≠
Only Priyanka ü•∞ü•∞üòò
Hamara haat pakerne se jyada pasand h ussko talwar pakkerna pasand h or talwar se jyada tumhari haat...üò≠üò≠<br>Line of painüò≠
Priyanka Chopra actually nailed this scene
It&#39;s easy to say mastani was wrong or Bajirao did mistake... <br><br>It will b always a grey part of life where people never accept it ... It&#39;s right or wrong.... <br><br>Getting married in childhood and living in battle field  Bajirao fall in love with mastani .... <br><br>He was clear but the this society step n started the battle ... Battle to keep there views on them.... Wht they got being a part .. who was happy ... <br><br>Always understand people have a part of life where we have to accept it..
Love u piryanka love u so machh
Kashi is the strong character... Priyanka did very well more than Deepika
Hear me out, we can appreciate both of them without demeaning the other. Let&#39;s be honest Deepika and Priyanka are queens! Nobody could&#39;ve done this better.
I appreciate mastani for her braveness. She was a warrior princess and she was a brave fighter for her land. That&#39;s one thing I liked about Mastani and she was a good mother also.<br>But I loved Kashi more than Mastani. She was a normal house wife and took care of her children and family members. She was not powerful like Mastani. But she had patients to face all sorrows. She was very kind hearted person that&#39;s why she saved Mastani and her son&#39;s life.<br>That was the strongest  power of her character.
‚öòüíïüíï‚öò
U r great Kashi .
Priyanka Priyanka i salute you, i have not watch the film but i know you will do better and great in this your film. Because you are a good Actress
Chala lava....üò™
Aksar hi kehte hai that agr apke sath apka pyar ho or puri duniya against hi to kuch fark nhi prhta..<br><br>But agr apka pyar hi apka na ho to puri duniya ka pyar bhi km prh jata h..<br>So ya kashi&#39;s pain definitely more than Mastani&#39;s painü•∫
No one will appreciate the love of Mastani and Bajirao...<br>But everyone can feel the pain and love of khasi...
Kashi bai was actually on the right wing.
Priyanka did justice to the role of Kashibai. She was hundred times better than the lead actress, Deepika
Love isn&#39;t just feeling, it&#39;s also a commitment.
Priyanka really made kashibhai legendary before this movie nobody have noticed her or her pain, Priyanka is really spectacular actress
Priyanka is great... Aisi koi aurat nhi kr skti h....

Please ye scene dekhao behin the onscreen shoot. Deepika and Priyanka saath saath mai shoot behind the screen ko leao ji.
Pc is to good
Kamaal hai bai üëåsuperb
Priyanka owns the scene. Kashibai ‚ù§ Honestly, I liked priyanka and ranveer more. Deepika had great lines but somehow they just came flat.
Oh m g. priyanka nailed it...
The only thing which make me sad was kashi sadness
I like priyanka ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üíïüíï
Deepika has no acting skills idk why is she overrated as mastani.<br>Priyanka stole the show from her. I NEVER knew Priyanka was a phenomenal actress until I watched This movie.
Chandramukhi naam hai na tumhara ? Log humhe mastani bhi bulate Hain. Ek baat mat bhoolna..mastaniyon ki taqdeer mein shauharat nahi hoti

Reminds me of princess Diana and Camilla.<br>Diana had lunch wth her
Priyanka is the best
tall people have a hard time dancing because they get tired easily but deepika padukone did those difficult steps so effortlessly i must say. her foot was swollen and she had back pain but she managed it so well,2 thumbs up to her. i must say she put her soul in that song something that only madhuri or sridevi could do in their times.
Mastani basically had no respect for herself!
Deepika   Plays the worst roles and all the wrong  characters
Well..yes just a movie.<br>Right..<br>But even  as a normal person,,I would never be able to select Deepika&#39;s role.<br>Anyws Superb acting no doubt by both....
Why only one who&#39;s loyal gets replaced?

both are my favourite...
Logics as per by Mastaani : unhone hamara haath pakdaa he ..par aapke chodha to nahi ...!
Deepika ka dialogue that one humara haath pakra hai appko chora yoh nhi is too good
Kashibai ka roll jitna achha PC ne kiya h utna achha shayad hi koi actress kar Pati . That&#39;s why I loved PC üòçüòç

I wonder how an extra maritial affair can be made such a great love story. It should be a story where kashi is the central character as she is the good one here
Back then men had no respect for women. A man can have as much as wives he want .Women were accessories for men. Just sit still and look pretty.
Oo god PC u r awesome...deepika is beautiful but acting skills was low than PC....seeing PC we fill the pain she had even without speaking....n mastani though speaking i cant understand wht was that
I didnot like that Mastani being a girl came to bajiro forcefully even knwing he was married n kashi was his childhood love....n like the way Kashi left him with her though she was hurt....kashi role was superb n PC act made it more loveable
Nice
Priyanka.... You are fabulous‚ú®‚ú®
In this movie story is changed mastani dint came here for love but her father gave her to peshva for his security here there was no love between mastani and bajirao it was just a deal between them in this movie history is changed so Sanjay Leela bhansali ko maar Mili jab vo padmavati ki movie Bana Raha tha kyu ki go iss story ko bhi na change karde üòÇ
Priyanka chopra and Deepika padukone both are beautiful and talented actress.

When I first read rau novel my heart straightly gone with kashabai...nd priyanka gave fully justice to her..I will always admire kashi bai.. nd sometimes I feel nothing is good enough for men even after  having such good wife like her he fall for other

Priyanka nailed it. She was brilliant in this movie. Better than Deepika.
Both are equally amazing in this scene tbh...but  damn deepika has some amazing eyessss !
Love priyanka
Priyanka is powerful in acting and Deepika is powerful in dancing. I love them both.
Kashi bai or mere khani ek he hai pati or sasural   ki khushi k liye dusre wife ko b  seh rhe hu  pyaar krte hu apne jaan se bhi jyada 1 nhi ek lakh galtiya maaf kar sakte hu apne pti ki. Bas sasural me buri ban jau ki sab dusre wife ko apna le   fir  khud unko  chod k khi Chale jaunge sirf un dono ki khushi k liye.
Has anyone noticed Priyanka&#39;s eyes when mastani says &quot;Rakhel&quot; priyanka with her eyes says&quot;Bang on...good dat you only said it&quot; it&#39;s a sadistic pleasure in her eyes...she is sad dat Bajirao loves mastani and pleasure coz in kashibai&#39;s eye mastani is still a second wife or to kore appropriately another women in her man&#39;s life...wow priyanka...Hands down you not I ly own this scenes and the screen but you also own this movie...like or comment if you agree
Why deepika is so overrated while in this scene we can see the difference between their expressions and acting skill..<br>In padmavat and this movie deepika&#39;s expressions were all same and they can be anyone&#39;s reaction but not a Queen&#39;s..<br>You will understand if you felt or read history deeply with heart and soul...<br>No offence to her but she was not like a queen in any of these movie

Rightly said by hina khan in an interview from bollywood hungama &#39;aap pc ko quantico mein dekhiye , ya phir kashi bai ke roop mein dekhiye , she just deserves 10 on 10 , matlab jo versatility hai un mein , woh kamaal ki hain&#39;
Pura dard hai priyanka ki awaz me kashibai kaüíî
This scene has a seperate fan base‚ù§Ô∏è priyanka is so amazing!
I don&#39;t know how Priyanka has mastered Marathi accent, she was good in Kaminey and superb in this one.....not many actresses can do this even after practicing or living in Mumbai for their entire life.<br>The way she says &quot; Chala laava&quot; is typically Marathi.
I love how both Baji and Mastani tried to justify what they did. It was unfair to Kashi...
Deepika is bst
What an acting... You both just nailed it.
Kashibai&#39;s life story:-<br>Before marriage, loved herself and her parents<br>After marriage, loved her husband and all his family members<br>When she met mastani, respected her like his husband does<br>After death of bajirao, loved mastani&#39;s son shamsher and trained him to become a warrior like his dad.<br>Who else is in respect for kashibai&#39;s soul nowüôã‚Äç‚ôÇüôã‚Äç‚ôÇüôå

such a great star pc<br>I love you pc
Kaunsa dil.... awesome dialogue..that mastani is a useless nuisance
Love the attitude kashibai....true
Kashi bai is right in the history
Priyanka deserved a national award for playing &#39;Kashi Bai&#39;.. She just nailed the roll.
Priyanka is natural....as compared with dipika
Priyanka wins our heart !.... isn&#39;t it guys?
Priyanka was super
Priyanka nd Deepika both of their feelings made me cry
Kashibai( priyanka Chopra ) <br>üôèüôèüôèüôè
They both ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Priyanka is a method actor!!
Originally.. Kashi bai was bhuddi.. And mastani was sexy
Priyankas voice is well suited for her character i loved her voice she pronounces every wordclearly
Deepika,  she&#39;s so tall
The film should be named as bajirao kashibai üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ<br><br><br><br>Pee cee stole the show
Both r my all time favorite actressüë≠
Metaphorically in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPOk8yVgPY&amp;t=109">1:49</a> when Kashi bai says &quot;pati ki lambi umra ki kamna karti hai&quot; while marking the tilak on Mastani&#39;s forehead she literally means the happiness of her husband is with Mastani. Envies yet maintains her own dignity and self-resect. Ohhh myyy the way Priyanka has portrayed the emotions is phenomenal. She is a top class actor üî•üî•
Rao ko tumhari zaroorat hai aur unki zaroorat ka khayal rakhna hamari zaroorat hai! üíî
Best scene
Priyanka is more more better than deepu
Line Kamal hai baiüëåüëå
Kashibais words were just like a knife on her heart...she nailed it..... nobody else could act Better than her...Deepika acted her role Soo well but kashibai  just lived her character üíì
Kashi was a good lay
Priyanka kha gai deepika ko .. What an acting and accent..üòç
When you watch this movie only for Kashibai aka PC
Who&#39;s your favorite ?<br>Kashi = like<br>Mastani = comment
I didn&#39;t like how deepika carried the role of mastani.. that character feels incomplete somewhr due to Deepika&#39;s acting... Whras for Kashibhai... OMG...!!! Watta way of performance man! Deepika has long long long way to go.. but PC just nailed the show...
Funfact :- after bajirao and mastani &#39;s death..  Kashibaai took care of samsherbahadur like her own son...
Dil pe lagi Priyanka ki acting üòòüòç
The painful fact is that when a man loves another woman more than you, Hell could scream and bent out his name but that won‚Äôt stop him. Kaashi bai took her situation with dignity. Learn women!, I love how she didn‚Äôt weep like the mess she is when she could have been feeling surreal pain. I also loved how she didn‚Äôt just blame Mastani for everything. Yes, Mastani might have tried to conquer Baijaro but he had the last say in the end.
Kon sa Dil kaisa dil
I AM.NOT INDIAN AND I DONT UNDERSTAND MOST OF THE WORDS BUT DAMN I AM CRYING JUST LOOKING AT QUEEN PC EYES HER EXPRESSIONS TELL IT ALL I FEEL HER PAIN SHR STAYS STRONG AND CIVIL A REAL QUEEN
Can anyone tell me what is the inner feeling of both while dng this
Pain of real love...  ‡§è‡§ï aurat apna pyaar kabhi  kisi aur ke sath nahi ‡§¨‡§æ‡§ü‡§®‡§æ chahti ‡§π‡•à kahe ka pyaar koun sa pyaar aaj iss pr aa gaya kal uss pr aa gaya... beautiful dialouge priyanka üëåüëåüëå
Kashibai was faithful strong and versatile she was the real hero of Rao&#39;s life Mastani was weak
I seriously think.. Tht deepika has nothing to offer than her teary eyed face.. With almost the same expression.. Priyanka overshadowed her completely.. Like she left her miles behind in acting.... Priyanka nailed it.. U go girl
Just rocking movie of 2015
Priyanka was fantastic in this movie
Those who are comparing DP and PC with each other must have forgotten that both of them made it here on their talent and not nepotism. They had to go through a lot of failure to understand the way to success. They both are irreplaceable as Mastani and Kashi.. Mastani&#39;s sadness was unspoken and Kashi&#39;s was helpless. Both of them created a very beautiful scene. It is unfair to call only one as superior.
Better than Deepika and Ranveer , acting of Priyanka was excellent in this movie.
Y to movie real life m jiske sath hota unko jake pucha dard hota kya h
In July 2019?
Priyanka killed it
Quite similar to Candramukhi and paro conversation in Devdas. Where madhuri over powered Ash. SLB fact.
Bhai eakhel ko rakhel nhi kahen gay to or kya kahen gay?
speechless!!!! such a deep deep meaning here!
i can see how everyone is talking about Priyanka. Kaashi bai was indeed the best part of the movie.
They are two best actress
Kashibai... Intelligent with innocence..
This movie just makes me sad. Even worse to think that this is actually based on real life events. In one place there is a ruler- brave, disciplined, capable; his wife- responsible, lover, traditional; a third woman- extremely beautiful, intelligent, tenacious. The story goes like- a married general honestly helps another kingdom; princess falls in love with him; seduces him; he still leaves her to go back to his wife and kingdom; she follows him; seduces him more; gets obsessed; lectures anyone that comes between her and her obsession; he marries her; ignores his first wife; further ignores his land and responsibilities. <br>But this story is supposed to be about &quot;love&quot; between these two and people now are supposed to celebrate this as Bajirao-Mastani. <br>Society always praised and liked a story where people broke rules. It&#39;s convenient to break rules and act hippie especially when two lovers are involved. What&#39;s hard is to be responsible human being, be good and follow rules and still be great lover. Kashibai did, she even had a miscarriage, and raised Bajirao-mastani&#39;s son. But we never hear a story called Bajirao-Kashibai. Regardless of her unconditional, selfless, responsible and matured love for her husband, she didn&#39;t get to include her name with her cheating man.
What a dialogue delivery by Priyanka üëçüëçüëçüëçshe is such a fine actress
Jay maharashtra
Kya bat hai pc<br>Kashi bhai k cracter mai jan daal diüíñüíñüíñüíñ
Kon kon agree krta h...isme Priyanka Madhuri ki tarah lag rhi h
Am I the only one who thinks they both look alike?
Priyanka is the bloody best she can play any roles mean anyyy..just love her..üòç‚ù§
Deepika is looking like real mastani but priyanka is not acting like real Khasibai
Kashi ki aawZ me bahut dard h<br>Nice priyanka
Krishna bhagvan ne bhi to shadi rukmini ji se ki thi par duniya to radha ji ke nam ko hi unke pehle lete he na <br>Mastani ki galti sirf itni thi ki voh aadhi muslim thi baki kuch nhi varna aur bhi raja senapati the unhone do teen baar shadi ki thi <br>Mastani hindu hoti to use apna lete<br>Aur mastani ne kashi se jyada hi saha he pura puna mastani ke khilaf tha bas peshva unke sath the jab ki pura puna kashi ke sath tha <br>Rakhel mastani ko bolte the kashi ko nhi <br>Kashi ko normal housewife ki tarah dikhaya he <br>N mastani warrier princess <br>Dono ka apna dukh prakat karne ka tareeqa alag tha
such horrible pathetic performance by both of them , Deepika is expressionless and is just saying dialogues and Priyanka Chopra&#39;s can&#39;t pull of the Marathi queen accent or body language it&#39;s looking to overdone , Tanvi azmi was just outstanding in the film
It is a success for Deepika since her role was negative and every one is hating her in this movie.....this is a great achievement as an actor .to make people feel and judge your role
Deepika expressionless. PC great expressions and dialogue delivery..outshines DP in every aspect
Bajirao Mastani full movies
Full movie taka
&#39;Kaun sa dil? Kaisa dil? Aaj is pe aa gaya, kal us pe aa gaya, phir?&#39; You said it sista!
Us time pe bajirao ko mastani ko ditch karke kisi aur ko pakadna chahiye tha tab us mastani ko pata chalta besharam lady agar marne ke baad bhi sun le to bolu sabse cheap lady thi woh bajirao ke gale pad gai isliye achi saja di god ne kabhi bajirao ke stah sukhi nahi reh payi dusri aurat ka ghar ujhada hai na usne bekar aurat apne swarthi pyar ke wajah se
Sare kehte hai deepika acting best karti hai but yahan priyanka ne maat de di usko
Ye 2 aurto wala kissa kb khtm hoga
Priyanka nailed each and every scene more than Deepika ‚ù§ Hats off to PC and salute to Kashi Baai üëè
Priyanka anytime
Awesome pc nad Deepika
Priyanka is more talanted than deepika..PC is the best...I love Kashibai ad feel so sad for her..
Priyanka&#39;s best ever acting
I love priyanka
Kashibai&#39;s every word has immense pain in them. It breaks my heart evrytime I see her character. PC nailed it undoubtedly.
Who could even bear an extra marital affair of her husband? Im on PC&#39;s side in this film. Deepika and Ranveer&#39;s relationship in this film isnt justifiable in any way. I feel so.
I don‚Äôt like Deepika‚Äôs acting. I mean tell me one time when she was successful in delivering a dialogue over coming her southindian dialect. On the contrary, Priyanka is a poised actress with excellent acting skills.<br>And her character was most lovable in this film.
mastani sucks
Where is the Dialogue ?
Priyanka has done strong acting
Mera boyfrnd married hai...kya mein  bhi rkhail hooüò≠üò≠üò≠üò¢üò¢üò¢
Deepika is so much prettier than Priyanka.

I was earlier disappointed bcoz I wanted priyanka to play mastani. But this woman is so talented that she completely stole the show even in a supporting role. Now m glad she played kashi coz actually kashi was the real hero and deserved to be played by a queen.
Priyanka is so good... damn.. she made me tearyüò≠<br><br><br><br>Believe me, I am not someone who cries easily
Priyanka brought Kashi&#39;s character on a whole different level that&#39;s why we feel more empathy for Kashi. Priyanka&#39;s acting as Kashi made me hate Bajirao-Mastani&#39;s affair.
my favorite scene in the whole movie.. I am already a Priyanka fan before watching this movie. I thought i was being biased when i felt Deepika is underwhelming. Then I saw the comments here... i was right all along.
Priyanka acting is very very best character for kashibai so originality act she a dancing of Pinga too good Priyanka  I really fan of Priyanka
Pc nailed it &quot;kon sa Dil ..Kaisa Dil ...&quot;üíì
Great acting from both !
Priyanka was the main star of this movieüòá
Priyanka is just....  Overwhelming
Best seen
How is Deepika expressionless? And why are people hating her if everything is bajirao&#39;s fault. It&#39;s always the same. Men make mistakes and woman pay the price. Anyway both are my fav. And the dialogue is right for us girls. Mastani is our inspiration ( in a good way) and Kashi is the true strength of us
PC is the BEST

This movie is yours Pc.. Don&#39;t care if the movie wasn&#39;t about u... For me the reason I ll watch the movie again is because you have graced the movie with your presence.. And the presence is felt.. the director owes u big time
I don&#39;t like the colored lenses, their natural eye color are soo mutch better and also the fair skin deepika is in natural darker and it looks beautiful

Priyanka Chopra did best
Priyanka and Deepika act&#39;s  awesome
Bajirao mastani movie full free
kashibai was rong
Priyanka nailed it! Deepika is so inferior to Priyanka. Boy can she act! Amazing PC!
upload full movie
Deepika ke dialogue Kam the , fir bhi usne apni aankhon se express Kiya , best actress in the world üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòò
in this scene Priyanka has more emotional and important role so she kinda dominated but Deepika did her role equally amazing nd looked very beautiful both r talented and beautiful but some r definitely jelouas of Deepu beauty
I really hated bajirao and mastani
Bakwas film really
the script and acting of Priyanka Chopra is awesome, and that is supporting Deepika&#39;s acting
The fact was that Kashibai hated Mastani to the core but couldn&#39;t do anything about Bajirao&#39;s choice and powers! Kashibai belonged to a rich and conservative Konkanastha brahmin family and her father was a big money lender!!! Commonly all sympathise with her character but my sympathy is only towards Mastani, who chucked everything in Bundelkhand and came to Pune only to suffer humiliation and insults from Peshava family members! Many attempts were made on life and she was treated as an outcast although she brought 33 lakh gold coins and properties from Bundelkhand and with her! Her death is still shrouded in mystery!!! Some people say she jumped into Bajirao&#39;s funeral pyre but her samadhi is located in Pabal, a small place about 60 km from Pune! How come? Some say she swallowed a diamond and killed herself!!! A repentent Kashibai tended Mastani&#39;s son Shamsher Bahadur as her own son and gave him his kingdom in Bundelkhand! Unfortunately, a mere 26 years old Shamsher Bahadur died in Panipat war in 1761!!!
am in love with kaasi and i hate this movie
¬°¬°¬°Oh...me fascina toda la m√∫sica Indu....felicidades a todos y todas las artistas, cantantes y bailarinas...todo el contingente de personas que trabaja para que nosotros podamos disfrutar esta maravilla...la mejor de todo el mundo...los amo....me gusta la pelicula ycancoones de Bajirao Mastani...
Priyanka ‚ù§‚ù§
it is sher jelousy of kashi bai... the problem of the society with mastani was that she belonged to enimity..a different comunity..caste..religion .,.otherwise marrying several times at those times was times was not at all offensive... for kshatriyas and brahmins it was even well accepted by the other wives.. even in todays times a woman can legally marry a man with other wife/wives in some religion and sects.., provided the other wives are not unsatisfied or neglected.. and those times ..it was absolutely common so kashibai&#39;s attituse is though obvious in the primary stage ..but what she does to mastani is not at all acceptable.. and is definately villianous... however i from my side is neither to kashibai&#39;s side nor mastani...but to the peole&#39;s side,..
in my idea dipika&#39;s dialogues over powers kashibai&#39;s,... cause if a mother takes another baby after one it may make the first child jelous for his or her brother/sister but that do not mean that the mother is wrong or loves one more than the other..
My favorite movie

Priyanka , just awsm acting, expression ...very nice
Deepika and Priyanka are both very versatile actors and best in their works. Its better not to compare them.
Sachin god gifted Priyanka too god gifted
I think no one else could nail this scene than Priyanka
PC osum
Priyanka did the right job.
Where can I watch this movie with English subtitles
ye seen meri ek friend se relete hota h very good
Every man should have at least 4 mal in his life... That&#39;s mardangi
i love all the scene of khashi bai.Priyanka Chopra.
Priyanka is a very fine Actress...... Hope Bhansali does not take Dum Expressionless Deepika in his next movie
Alway respect is given to kashi.. such a strong women n inspirational lady
PC is the best
Nice
Omg hats off what a woman!!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kashibai">#kashibai</a>
best  acting by priyanka chopra...
Pryanka was right in this scene the reason is nobodys  Wife doesn&#39;t want to have a next Wife of her husband..
Mastani eyes are always watery. I swear she suffers as much as Kashibai. Hats off to both girls. They were wonderful in the movie
priyanka chopra outstanding
so......üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Nice
Deepika who?<br>This is Priyanka Chopra. The goddess of Acting.<br>Priyanka in a supporting role, subdued Deepika&#39;s lead role.
Pc nailed
I like u and respect u kashi bai
wowsome......
priyankaüòò
I am a details fan but here priyanka won my heart
Aish-Madhuri or Dipika-Priyanka ....proud of Indian cinemaüôèüèª
&quot;&quot; kaisa dil ,,kaun sa dil... Jo aj is pe aagaya kal uspe aagaya..&quot;&quot;.  uffff dat dialogue.....
Kaunsa dil..kaunsa pyaar....seriously its the emotions which makes someone do things which will irritate them as wwll as others.....I just hope everyone understands the true meaning of love is to love ur ownself..then to get irritated becaz of someone else....
Really priyanka c really owsm actor...kamal ahe bai..
It&#39;s really very painfull for kashibai......if woman like mastani exist in our society than woman like kashibai has to face troubles through out life.....atleast mastani mother would have said her marrying other husband is a big sin......I pray for god not to give birth to daughter like mastani to ruine other woman life......may your soul rest in peace kashibai......
Kaash mujeme bhi aap ke jaisa himmath ho tha tho aaj mere life acha hotha priyanka<br>Hands Of dear. For great motivation
wherever pryanka acts she just nails it
I love this movie so much. My American friends wanted to watch a bollywood movie, I think this would be perfect.
Wtf is with all the hate for Deepika? Everyone is saying she acted so expressionless blabla... did we watch the same movie?!! Her acting was as stunning as Priyankas!<br><br>Ever considered that most of the situations Mastani was in are surprising, sad and breath taking?! What??!!... should Deepika have played Mastani... for example in this scene. Should she start to extremly cry or shout the words because Mastani was feeling incredibly sad and wanted Kashi to understand that Bajirao still loves her the same as before?!!<br>Deepika played it perfectly! Just like Mastani would have reacted to Kashibais speech in a real life situation.<br><br>Plus ya&#39;ll are forgetting that Mastani was a princess and that influenced her behavior a lot (also) because of how she was raised with her future privileges and duties/obligation and so on.
pc nailed it!!!! :-) :-)
great priyanka ....üòÉ
Proud to be maratha üòÄ
I hate this scene but I like kashi dialogue
i hated mastani bai nd loved kashi bai ..more over both the ladies nailed their roles

Hatts off priyanka chopraüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå
But isme na bajirao ki galti thi or na mastani ki. Un dono ki shadi ek shadyantra tha. Or maj boori me baji ko ye relation accept krna pda. Kashi k liye ye mushkil zarur tha per ek patni hone k nate use apne pati ko samajhna chahiye tha.

Yes she is love with bhajerao.  Hasini. Honey
Deepika was average in this movie..
priyanka deserves a national award for best supporting actress for this movie... n deepika ...zero expressionsüòÇüòÇ

Mind blowing akr prinka
plzzz agar pure movie de to achcha hoga plz plz plz plz plz plz plzplz
As a child when I used to read history in school I never liked mastani...Even after knowing that a n is married how can any woman with self dignity get into relationship with that man....When this movie came out a started hating mastani more...She had destroyed life&#39;s of many ppl. I found..And I still find Kashi to be the best.. And an idol to every women
i dont like mastani.. true love aisa nhi hota kise or k lifepartnr ko cheen lo....
Deepika is beautiful, elegant and talented. She acts really really good. i swear I&#39;m not lying. But Priyanka gave better than her own best in every scene of this film. That&#39;s what makes me her fan. ‚ù§‚ù§
kaun sa dill, kesa dill
every1 hailing for priyanka...but i think in this particular scene deepika&#39;s eye speak much more than priyanka
love priyanka hate dipika
hii
What an epic scene by priyankaüòçüòçüòç the Queen of Bollywood. and future queen of Hollywood.
Mastani had too much audacity, knowing that rao was married, she acted clingy and went to his life and Rao..the cheater who couldn&#39;t respect the love of his wife towards him. Fuck both of them. Pathetic human beings...one who couldn&#39;t be committed and the other one who was basically whoring around a married man in the name of love. That is not love.
Every one think your selves in this position would you ever go to Mastani if you were in her place <br>Kashi bai is the real warrior she was always there for Peshwa <br>Bajirao is not brave he left her in so much pain .......
who the hell was saying urdu n hindi r same . everything kashi said in pure hindi like jodha used to speak in that serial is totally out of my understanding :/
I&#39;ll give some of the credit to deepika, she was also goodüòòüòç
I&#39;ll give some of the credit to deepika, she was also good
in this move priyanka is the best.......i watched this move over and over just because of priyanka. she is excellent
Another powerful scene of Kashibai. Dialogues are so touching. Priyanka you are an artist. When I was going to watch this movie I thought it will all be about Bajirao and Mastani. But in the end I felt it was about Kashi Bai too. Character so strong, pure and pious.
both r amazing
My fav scene from this movie üëå
Priyanka, you almost made me cry. Even if i dont understand your dialogues, i literally could feel your pain

Just watched this movie and this is my fav scene. This scene shows a huge contrast of acting skills in these actresses. Priyanka steals the show hands down! Special mention to her dialogue delivery which has nuances of a Marathi accent. Much respect and huge salute from New Zealand ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫
this is the message for all who have morethan 1 wife and wish to have more than one wife

flick ppp weep all L am
The most thing I loved about this scene is the &quot;kaunsa dil kaisa dil&quot; and &quot;hame jitna bura bhala kehna tha humne keh diya&quot;. It shows that Kashibai was hurt by the two <br>of them yet she doest not have the nature to demean them.She understood Mastani&#39;s position in the love triangle and still held respect for her. She was jealous amd hurt yet she let her huzband go and sacrificed her happiness for them. She held her head high made everyone know that she had a voice too. that era She is truely the embodiment of love and sacrifice. üòî
priyanka. Chopra.  I  have a. big. fan name. Taniya

Deepika is still not natural, she still has a long way to go. She does have good expressions but there is no depth in her dialogue delivery. Sometimes i feel she&#39;s uncomfortable saying her dialogues. Priyanka seems more natural in both her dialogue delivery and expressions. Priyanka beats Deepika any day, any time.
to me I never get it they both look them same who&#39;s deeoika and whose priyanka
I love this movie

Priyanka is so annoying

Couldn&#39;t stand the bull***t Mastani said &quot;he never left you&quot; and what not....he broke her completely which is far more painful then leaving someone

Priyanka is looking gorgeous and very pretty. She can play a role of a attractive, modern FBI agent in Quanticoand a stunning, traditional women in Bajirao Mastani. She can play various roles and she gives her best in what she does. Well done! She acts too well!

God ! this movie&#39;s great!!
im waiting this film show on tvüòßüòß
deepika I love u
what is the background theme during Kaushi&#39;s parts???? ITS AMAZINGG
Why is deepika trying to be like aishwarya rai and she also has blue lenses on wtf i feel like they are stealing everying from devdad ! Pryanka is madhuri and deepike aish
ÿ≠ŸÑŸà
deepika has to deal with society&#39;s hatred where pryanka has to share husband with another woman. her pain is way bigger than deepika.
I dont like priyanka...but this movie she nailed it...her dilog delivery and expressions...the way she said kon sa dil kaisa dil...!! Woow
I was shocked to learn this was based on a true story. I felt bad for Priyanka Chopra&#39;s character Kashabi.. At first I wasn&#39;t sure what to think about Mastani. I admired her warrior skills. However, I didn&#39;t like how she went after Bajirao when she knew he was married. But then I find myself admiring her for still loving him no matter how many ridicule her.
This scene uplifts Kashibai&#39;s character from the others! This scene predominantly depicts the dilemma she faces as - being a woman and then, the knowledge that Love cannot be bound by anything and that Bajirao and Mastani are truly in Love. As the wife , it is unacceptable to her, but the depth of Bajirao&#39;s and Mastani&#39;s love is something she acknowledges. The first 2 mins of the scene reflects what any woman would typically feel and say. The vituperative outburst is not what Kashibai is made of. So, this is used as a sarcasm to the prevailing norms of the society, wherein tradition, custom is given more importance than Following the Heart! The real Kashibai and her spirit comes into play when she emboldens Mastani to stay strong though there will be even harsher comments thrown at her by the society! This dialogue between the 2 women is so aesthetically done, that it maintains the Epic Quality of the Story and the Epic characters. Minus this understanding, it would have degraded into a cat-fight and a mediocre masala movie!
epic scene and acting of priyanka in this scene ohhüëåüëåüëèüëèüëçüëçüëç
kashibai is truly an unsung heroine...not only she accepted her husband &#39;s infidelity..after his death she adopted their son shemsher Bahadur and raised him as her own...her sacrifice was highlighted in the movie..also priyanka nailed it !! superb acting üëåüëçüëè
this is strange. Though I don&#39;t understand a word I can anyhow feel the pain they&#39;re both going through. Such good acting!
Speaking with a loud voice and making loud expression doesnt make an actress a heroine PC was good as far dialogue delivery is concerned but when it comes to correct composure in front of camera she is nowhere, Deepika on the contrary has just given all out with her eyes, the scene was not a confrontation b/w the 2 it was a scene where Kashibai had to dominate  over mastani( hope the idiots who watched did not notice that) and so it was a perfectly placed scene with correct acting on deepika&#39;s part.<br>She is great and PC nothing but bullshit overactress
Deepikaüëåüëåüëåüíïüíñüíì
Deepikas acting was so subtle and beautiful . Much better than Priyankas who was good, but a little over the top
I love you deepika
Most overrated actress ever - Deepika... Expressionless dialouge delivery ... PC is flawless .. Agree with those who comment that she slayed!! 
priyanka chopra&#39;s performance was as strong as Ranveer &amp; Deepika :-)
rao shi h ... dono hatho me ladoo chahiye.... PC u rocks in every scene...
PRIYANKA
Random question, are they speaking Hindi? If so is there a particular dialect they&#39;re speaking?
Does the movie come with English Subtitles?
&quot;upvastra.... wo aam bhasha mein kya kehte hain use...&quot;<br>&quot;mazak karna to koi tumse seekhe...&quot;<br>&quot;konsa dil....kaisa dil?&quot;<br><br>oh god.... shes just amazing :D
DP is the best PC is stupid and idiot PC to is not beautiful
priyanka lu u
No matter how beautiful or powerful bajirao &amp; mastani&#39;s love story is...PC showed the true pain through which Kashibai would have gone through and honestly that is the highlight of the movie. Each and every dialogue delivery and expression of Priyanka makes you cry with her, and feel her pain. This, and her scene with her husband where she talks about preferring to lose her life than her pride....these two scenes are enough to understand Kashi&#39;s story, pain and PC brilliant performance!!
V nice but sad story
I like deepika but when i watched bajirao mastani .wow priyanka  you are superb ****fab marathiüòò*rocking acting. in that movie your acting superb than deepika
I wish that I could understand something
Priyanka Priyanka Priyanka.
DP is best but PC........ yes but I like DP
In this Scene Priyanka as Kashibai, show their talent with powerful arrogance &amp; respect about 2nd wife of her husband Bajirao..<br>&quot;Humko jitna bura bhala  kahna tha kah diya.. per is saniwar-wada me tumko isse bhi jyada gandi or galeech batein sunne ko milengi Mastani...  Tum sunna..   Apna dil maila mat karna...&quot; <br>This is amazing.. WOW..
I think Priyanka became popular only after launch of some of her songs !!!! None of her Bollywood movies except Mary kom and Bajirao Mastani were like sooooo special....whereas Deepika....she can play the character of Mohini to piku to Mastani perfectly....Deepika is perfect she is like acting and beauty goals......I don&#39;t wanna become an actress, but whatever career I chose, I wanna be as successful as Deepika in my field.....
Priyanka¬† won the battle in this scene
Priyanka&#39;s acting is mind blowing n so realistic!

Subtitles pls......
Name the video with the characters and not the actors who played their roles...
kaunsa dil? kaisa dil ? Priyanka stole the show
priyuuuuuuuüòçüòòüòòüòòüòò
What a scene...  what expression....  what love..  what sacrifice....  every word every feel... Pain of both of them... I am in luv wth two at one tym
One word for deepika &#39;s acting , Natural. I love her acting more she is full of grace. As the official wife pc&#39;s acting is not mature for me. It&#39;s my opinion  just saying.
awsm film ranveer singh , deepika paducone &amp; priyanka chopra did well üëçüëçüëçüëèüëèüëè deepika paducone is my fave actoress
awsm film ranveer singh , deepika paducone &amp; priyanka chopra did well üëçüëçüëçüëèüëèüëè deepika paducone is my fave actoress
both of them r 2 talented. India should be proud of them
That line by PC, &quot;kaun sa dil.....&quot; is just amazing. PC just lived the character.
better kareena she has more expression for mastani role then deepika,but the director have making a good job for approach priyanka chopra for kashibai role,she has the expressionüòçüòò
Deepika is looking like a goddess and Priyanka&#39;s acting is awesome
Loved this film. But I think it would have been better with Ash as Mastani and Priyanka
pls converted into telugu
Priyanka over powers this scene. I went to see this movie thinking I would love Mastani and Bajirao but coming out I felt for Kashibai and Priyanka nailed it. She can play anything
Priyanka darling is sooo Amazing
&quot;Kesa dil? Konsa dil?&quot; ugh priyanka u slay girl
PC AND DP ARE THE BEST. !‚ô°‚ô•
Omg Priyanka Nailed it
Priyanka behaved in this scene like any woman in her situation would. She has to deal with the other woman in her husband&#39;s life, trying to accept the situation while venting out her anger and frustration at the other woman. she just nailed it in a subtle way and i don&#39;t think she overacted in this scene at all.
PRIYANKA FAMINE BEAUTY WAS REVEALED IN THIS FILM AS SHE DID PLAYED QUEEN WHO IS INTELLIGENT BUT STILL KNOWS THE COST OF THE WORD &#39;SACRIFICE&#39;
wow just wow pc u slayed it
deepika is the best!PC too
Kashi invites Mastani
Deepika doesn&#39;t over does it  like PC <br>Deepika is more natural like how a normal person would behave and talk<br>This women slayed Bajirao
PC nailed it .. Completely overshadowed to Deepika
The intensity ,agony,and every f** emotion there is in Pryanka&#39;s eyes..omg &lt;3 &lt;3 <br>Those eyes are swords &lt;3
0municipalm b. H,&amp;&amp;
deepika &lt;3
SUPERB MOVIE.
Haha, love how Priyanka goes &quot;Chala...laava&quot; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzPOk8yVgPY&amp;t=131">2:11</a>.
pc nailed it! what a scene!
Priyanka Chopra slayed the whole movie. CLASS ACT!
Priyanka nailed every scene in Bajirao Mastani! Queen PC slayed!
padma Sri priyanka chopra rocked üòçüòçüòò
amazing by both!
Padma Shri Priyanka Chopra - WOW! What a scene! What heart? What kind of hear? &#39;Kashibai&#39; - the women the world had forgotten. Her dignified and resilient power and nature made her the amazing women she was. This movie won me over and I fell in love with Kashibai - Mind you, Priyanka has done a TERRIFIC job portraying the small nuances of her character. She was lost, worried, slightly jealous and envious. Both well done!
they are both so incredibly beautiful ! Wish there were english subtitles ! ((((
