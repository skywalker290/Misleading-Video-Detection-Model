This is just like when Portugal won in 2017, people wanted Bulgaria to win, but more people appreciated Portugal. Why can’t people just stop complaining that Turkey didnt win? It was literally years ago, more people liked Lena, so what? Manga was also good, but not every wish comes true ya know.

I do not know what emotions went into the writing of this song or what emotions come through during your singing of, but for me I lost my partner just a week ago and this song feels like morning,, morning the loss of her.
Can we just agree that we need to bring this vibe back. 10 years later and this song still hits different. Truly a masterpiece.
