THIS spectacular scene always puts a BIG smile to my face seeing all those amazing colourful cars come out of that garage, it always reminded me so much of when I was playing with all my Hot Wheels cars as well as watching the older Fast &amp; Furious films at the same time growing up as a kid 😄🛞🔥

All together how many vehicles were there all together there must have been about 100 hundred and also my favorite part is when the trucks came on out to smash the cop cars and by also pushing and shoving the cop car&#39;s on out of the way

No matter how crazy the newer movies get this is this an iconic moment in the series for me
I remember seeing this scene when I was a kid. I immediately went to go recreate it with my hotwheels.
&quot;it&#39;s a scramble baby, a big one!&quot;<br>one of my favorite scenes in the whole franchise.

They have the suspect surrounded yes they do themselves. Next time not corrupt minds of babies with all these movies you know after all they teach us in psychology class baby learn by mimiking environment and with parents at work all the time kids watch tv they learn you know from movie without parent supervision like in movie cable guy this proven psychological fact as they see as normal because they accept what they see as baby or small child thats why kids they run around be gangster you know they learn like guy in cable guy movie just to create job for you mr policeman like this movie fast and furious kids see this when they get license they want to go FAST again job for you give speeding ticket i think maybe go speak to your boss mr big in government cause i think maybe the criminal there you know because you know CIA NSA they all speak about all this mind engineering i think this maybe big problem because it affect planet you know.

Bravo 😉
Back when privacy wasn&#39;t given up, and technology wasn&#39;t as advanced, organised crime like this was actually very difficult to stop. Nowadays, even with hide away licence plates, it&#39;s too easy for cops to track down who they need.
Those dodge rams tho 😍

I know at the time they were a dime a dozen back then, but seeing all of those old Caprice 9C1 cop cars get damaged and possibly totaled in this scene REALLY stings, especially with how rare and expensive they seem to be getting nowadays.  But other than that, this has always been one of my FAVORITE scenes in this movie aside from the races, just seeing those big ol&#39; Ram trucks just come out charging like a bunch of angry bulls towards the cops and them having to run or reverse away was just pure gold!

I loved this scene
When your at heat level 5
why does that lancer sound like a subie ?
Bilkins looks good
went downhill after this movie
Imagine how much it would of costed to hire so many sports cars for this scene im curious as to how noone does so i am asking.
that supra tho
I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS WEIRD UNTIL I WATCH FAST AND FURIOUS WITH THE ROCK AND MR. HOBBS
Anyone else see the cop car lose a hubcap while rolling in at the beginning?
The aerial shots make it look like a pack of colorful fire ants scattering from an ant hill
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arK4MTbcTM&amp;t=133">2:13</a> what car is it?
I miss the moment of this era, before a freaking somebody say it was rice, What the hell man

The Fast and the Furious franchise was just hook with cars <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvTUkRSxE7o">https://youtu.be/DvTUkRSxE7o</a> cats like hooks
It&#39;s a shame you don&#39;t see cars like them anymore
Super performance
Tuner cars era will forever be the best era for cars in history.
If this was in GTA 5 then the cops would have shot all off them straight away.
Roses are red violets are blue if you give a like God will forgive you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arK4MTbcTM&amp;t=22">0:22</a>xx

by far my fav scene
FBI: Where the hell are they??<br><br>Romain: EJECTO SEATO CUZ!!!
I bought GTA<br><br>Did this<br><br><br><br><br>Then went home and played GTA
Looks like the police are surrounded by the boy racers and girl racers in the high performance cars and they’ve been force to split up and try and stop one of them at the time before they cause drama on the roads
Good thinking by these brave officers to run away from their cars just incase the pick up trucks go smashing into them some of them even more braver retreated in their cars
Look at differences between the black police helicopter the bell 407 and the white police helicopter the bell 206 the different is the sound even though they are from the same company by the bell group
That’s a lot of cops
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arK4MTbcTM&amp;t=104">1:44</a> can Anyone explain to me why that “yeah” was awkwardly placed in between those scenes lmao wtf 😂 what does it have to do with anything
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arK4MTbcTM&amp;t=78">1:18</a> song?
Can we take a moment and think just how big the interior of that garage is to store THAT many cars?
Ricers wet dream
My favorite scene as a kid. My Dad would always let me know if it was on TV 😂
18 yrs
Everyone when school dismiss

I never did understand why the eclipse sounded like a Subaru lol
Fun Fact: Some of these cars were supposed to be planned cars for the movie, but they were scratched off from production unfortunately. Edit: also some of these were leftovers from the first film, sorry about that
The cops got played so hard
Hot Wheels World race highway 35 reference
I miss when The F&amp;F franchise was actually about racing and cars and not fucking heists and shit
In fast and furios most of the drivers are ricers
One question I got... anyone in the comment section who was in this part of the movie?
Mobilnya yang berhamburan bikin polisi kualahan

In 2003, Mitsubishi decided to sell Evo&#39;s in the US. This film was sort of a Advertising campaign for the &quot;new&quot; car.

Always loved the trucks first appearance...<br><br><br>Back when CrownVics were primarily the police patrol car and very few SUVs.<br><br>Now LEOs upgraded to Chargers and higher performance cars, and high powered SUVs.

Badass scene luckily i Know a few friends that had theree car in this scene beast bro 💯👐 was even luckier to find out about it.
Back then when you were a tuner even if you had mods on the car <a href="http://looks.now/">looks.now</a> everyone says you are a ricer if you have big spoilers,neon and stickers.even if you have 1000 hp
I prefer the GTA version lol
RIP to those gate openers
How awesome would it be if this happened in real life?!
When I watched this years ago I remember always thinking this was the coolest scene <br>Still do
I watched this movie many times but still don&#39;t know what the plot is.
This scene always brings a smile to my face, I love it!

I remember leaving the theater after watching the 1st fast and furious movie. Everyone left the parking lot like this and continued to do so down the highway. Everyone was pumped from what they just finished watching. Nothing dangerous just having fun. The good old days. Take me back.
So funny lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arK4MTbcTM&amp;t=75">1:15</a>
Is NISSAN SKAILAINE FOR FAST EN FURIOS
😂 😂 😂 J&#39;adore cette scène
No multi million dollar supercar in sight
Is this a police training video? Because they are just pointing there guns everywhere like normal cops.
Who let a PT cruiser in there?
Pt cruiser. Guess they ran out of cars
I know my tags are out of date😂
Runing out a cop car. <br>Well every body has to tray it one time.<br>I did it in 2001 with a BMW 328i tuned to about 220-230 hp. <br>The time was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arK4MTbcTM&amp;t=1320">22:00</a>h + so empty roads.<br>Well it was not a match with his Opel Astra SW probably 1.8 16V engine with 115 hp.<br>The persut was about 4-5 kilometers long. I hawe evafe him by turning from regional road to local road after gaining some distance and turned off the lights.<br>😉
back when fast &amp; furious was dope
Out of every car there, is take a Crown Vic.<br><br>Ultra reliable boat on wheels.
Anybody else see the hubcap rolling at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arK4MTbcTM&amp;t=3">0:03</a>?
In real life the police would shoot at those trucks ramming.
One of the best movie scenes
17yrs ago. That is so hard to believe. <br>The older I get, the faster time goes
God those cars were stupid Haha.
Thank God cars like this are dead
im i the only one who would rather drive the 9C1 caprice? <br>with the LT1 and 3.42 gears.
You seen one seen them all.
Back when Fast and Furious movies weren’t corny as hell and unrealistic
When I saw all the cars in the garage pouring out, my eyes first set on that silver PT cruiser.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS9evujbgrw">https://youtu.be/iS9evujbgrw</a>
All that rice and beans. Just need some cheese and chips.
Best scene in the whole series in my opinion.
Anyone have ketchup for all that rice?
Am I the only one who saw that police hubcap at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arK4MTbcTM&amp;t=4">0:04</a>?? 😂😂🤣🤣 it took me 7 times to watch the movie over and over to see that

When Need for speed payback only got one lobby
cops can&#39;t handle like THIS!!! cops can&#39;t handle like THAT!!! Sexy bitches n&#39; bros SCAT!!!
I&#39;ve been to the place where they shot that
Back when the series was good
Now if u modify anything to aftermarket, ricer. Fucking hell gen z need to fuck off
What happened to the fast and the furious, went from this to just and action movie
I hated it because Officers are hard working and they are now chasing like 100 Car!

Dude How The Fuck They Do This Scene Shit Thats Alotta Whips Lol
Gay
Imagine a big crash! I did 😂
How tej go from goofy street racer organizer that didn&#39;t like technology. To being a world class hacker in 4 years?
Before i liked it, but now its like  a ricer community scrambling lol.
all the cop caprices just destroyed goddamn :(
So the question is Where R They???really, where r they? Haha
How did  the Fast and Furious  go from this to saving the fuckn world???
This is gay
Reminded me of Pay-n-Spray from GTA games 😆
This scene when i was a kid <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23chills">#chills</a>
Back when fast and furious was the bollocks
I miss this f&amp;f.
The best scene i have ever seen in my life.
also why did the guy in charge of the chase look so defeated when he thought they were cornered.... like wasnt that the whole point of you telling them where they were to the helicopters lol.
as an american and someone moderately knowedgeable about symbols of 9-11    i dont remember that truck being in this movie.   but sure as shit it makes its first appearance at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arK4MTbcTM&amp;t=65">1:05</a> without the campershell.
Wow I see German, Japanese and American cars
I remember being a kid and watching this and thinking how fucking badass that was
People would rather beef and argue at car meets than perform elaborate scrambles lmao
This movie is a stain on the whole franchise.
Holy shit!<br><br>Look at all those Hot Wheels 🚘
When 2f2f was bout racing and dope cars
Halo cops and robbers be like
I like them Dodge ram trucks
this makes me miss those days. the cars may not have been entirely functional or even fast, but they had so much fucking cool it didnt matter. i cant wait until i can build my own 2000s tuner car, i dont care what most people think
This scene had the same energy as the final fight scene in the endgame.
Who disliked this video? Kind of woman like mans hah?
Oh god damn those 3000gts hell yes
If im a cop and real i will sacrifice ill crash the heli to the ground
I just saw a pt cruiser in there ruined the whole scene forever
This was my favorite part in the movie when I used to see it when I was a kid. Me an my little brother would always do this part with little cars haha..cause we had a bunch of them and two cop cars and we would just act it out.
Ricepocalyption
i wonder how many accidents did it take to film this scene?
Who els did this with hot wheels as a kid?
😍😍😍
Back when cars actually looked different and were unique :(
Stupidest movie franchise ever.
When u punch someone on gta <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arK4MTbcTM&amp;t=3">0:03</a>
This me and my friends!
the best part of 2 fast 2 furious
That scene makes no sense police had guns and didn&#39;t open fire on any of them trucks heading straight at them?? Come on unrealistic or what.
Its called 2fast 2furious shitheqd
Irl cops would open fire due to use of deadly weapon against them (and yes, I mean cars as deadly weapon) and it would be fully legal even if they had killed some guys. Seen this multiple times, so this scene seems to me very unrealistic.
The Blue S14 😍😍😍
Did anybody else catch sight of the Hot Wheels custom Civic?
Best moment
А че за фильм
Badass scene, I would&#39;ve rather seen some super dutys or some duramaxs in that scene though, they are the best 3/4 ton trucks
one of the most epic scenes in fast and the furious franchise, and most memorable
The cops would have wasted those trucks
Shit movie 👎🏻🤮🤮
rice as far as the eye can see

No
This is Florida I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t shoot the truck drivers 🤣
Okay, I&#39;ll ask it. Why does the purple Mitsubishi sound like a Subaru...?
<b>need for speed be like</b>
HEAVEN !!!
I see how there&#39;s car guys seeing this and saying &quot;RICER!!&quot; yes they are ricers I definitely cannot deny that but still this scene was pretty cool, if they actually had tuned good looking cars then it would be better
The best line ever said in any Marvel movie!<br><br>“Where are they?” <br><br>😂🙃

&quot;This is unit 2599 we have the suspect surrounded at least from this side&quot;
Back when it used to be about street racing and running away from cops. Now it&#39;s about fighting an army and driving tanks really fast
imagine watching this movie when it came out and all those cars were brand new. some of you prolly have but i was born in 01 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Rip Paul.
Show ur cars for catch.☺️
O hell no
Back in the day fast and furious is a movie about tuning a car for race, not for doing some saving earth from the alien
So predictable and boring. A waste of time.
So many cars 😍😅
