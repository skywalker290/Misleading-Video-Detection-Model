Hallo
ISRAELI ZIONISTS DID IT
☢️Japan Japan☣️☢️
Thanks to the USA and their General Electrics.
Never Going To Stop Killing The Sea  &amp; The EARTH
What are the buildings on the right and why are they shakingso violently
Three reactors went in the air and only radiation leak reported! Seven and half years on melted reactors still glowing and hundreds tons of highly radioactive water pouring into dead Pacific each day.   Journalists don&#39;t write about this, they only allowed to write about preparation for the Olympics. In Japan they receive 15 years sentence for telling the truth about Fukushima.  Go to North Korea, guys, they will teach you free speach and democracy...
fukushima is our demise...
i can see my house<br> you can see it below the video
ISRAEL Mossd installed Low Yield NUKES inside of cameras placed in FUKUSHIMA (they had unrestricted access)...<br>ISRAEL embedded a High Yield NUKE inside of Japan seabed...<br>WHY?? ISRAEL WARNED JAPAN TO STOP ASSISTING IRAN ENRICH URANIUM....<br>☆ Japan&#39;s Goverment knows this. ISRAEL threatened to set off more NUKES if they retaliate, a High level official confirms it, or they help IRAN ☆
Guys, check Nuclear inc 2 - nuclear power plant simulator for Android. There are Chernobyl and Fukushima levels.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmA4Y_AvgK4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmA4Y_AvgK4</a>
That containment house where the explosion came out of just looked like it was made out of cardboard.
미친 시발 헬게이트 오픈이네
Yeah you guys are right 530 sieverts an hour is nothing to worry about.
Believe me, does assholes from the government dont tell you Anything. They never give the right numbers of radiation. Because then they Will loose lots off money. Money meens more then people
Hoping for Godzilla to spring up somewhere in the next few years. Maybe alongside Kong v Godzilla movie in 2020? Would be great marketing.
2085 days later and we are all fine .. its all been Fukushima FEAR PORN 101 .. live you are alive ..
That&#39;s was the earthquake that caused that right?

Good job you goofy engineers.  Next time try putting your backup coolant pumps further up above sea level in a known tsunami risk zone perhaps?  Maybe on platforms high up on concrete pillars.  Anything is better than this mess.  The sad thing is that it&#39;s likely a problem all over the world and I doubt much has changed since this situation.  Things that make you go &quot;duh&quot;.  A geiger counter is a wise investment in today&#39;s society where everyone thinks &quot;it won&#39;t happen to us&quot;.  Check my channel for videos testing some commonly found antique store glass items for radiation.  Yes, it&#39;s all over the place in almost every shop I&#39;ve seen.
Radioactive hydrogen explosion
Notice how their is a video of the explosion.<br>Just sayn ! 
<b>Throughout history, Japan and its perverted, demented, and merciless citizens have done nothing but wreak havoc to the rest of the world.  Go to hell Japan.</b>
TEPCO and Japanese Government cover-up death of Fukushima workers, intimidate journalist who covered it. <a href="http://nsnbc.me/2014/03/21/exposed-death-of-fukushima-workers-covered-up-by-tepco-and-government/">http://nsnbc.me/2014/03/21/exposed-death-of-fukushima-workers-covered-up-by-tepco-and-government/</a>
If anybody wants to know how to beat their commercials...get to my wall and ask..lol it&#39;s easypeezyLemonBeezy!!! Haha--
Wow :o so hardcore
I live in Fukushima. My older sister gave birth to a cheerful girl in December of this year.There is surely the problem of the radioactivity. But I don&#39;t really hear the stories such as deformity. Do not accept the false information in the net. I will love it by any chance even if one&#39;s child was born with an obstacle
reactor 4 is like building 7 in the world trade center- an utter impossibility, a blatant smoking gun . reactor 4 contained no fuel on 3 11 11 and was therefor unoperational.  thank isreal for their sick minds and mini nukes. 
It&#39;s been almost 3 years since this.  There would be ton&#39;s of deformed babies by now.  It&#39;s getting kind of obvious that no deformed babies showing up online out of this proves one massive coverup.  The hospitals would have to be taking those newborns, putting them someplace out of sight???   The only way people found the pictures from Chernobyl is years of leaking little by little pictures of where they were being cared for in remote little hospital, group home settings….now what are they doing with those deformed newborns in Japan?
28 Signs That The West Coast Is Being Absolutely Fried With Nuclear Radiation From Fukushima
Everybody read that!
How can you &quot;discover&quot; an &quot;invention&quot;?
canned tuna 
Which was that blast, fart or poo?
just go nuke those cunts, they&#39;re endangering us all!
nothing
I wonder whats going to happen to the newborns out west in in California, what type of damage could the radiation leak do to them
where did you get that info... Wikipedia
Japan intended to sell enriched uranium to Iran, there by Iran wold stop making enriched uranium themselves, by doing that they would have stopped another war in the middle east fought for oil. Israel was in charge of the security at Fukushima, they infected the computers whit Stuxnet so the reactor won&#39;t shut down

August 8, 2013 - Upsalite: liquid toxic, oil spill cleaner, etc...??????
Announcement: For those who don&#39;t know yet. There is a newly discovered invention called &quot;upsalite&quot; that can absorb oil spills, toxic materials, etc. The question is, can it be used to absorb and clean radioactive leakages from powerplants?
Real disaster will be start about 6years later.

福島第一原発を治め収める。
(I swim in the english channel every day during summer and I hope someone can tell me the dangers I have to face because I have no idea want are the risks.)
The english Channel near France now as more radiations than Fukushima according to independant scientists. Thanks to our (I am french) E.P.R new generation we have electricity and water contamination but our state doesnt say a word about it. 

Nuclear i energy is good cause it&#39;s less poluting than coal or oil but radiations.... god knows what will happens to us next ? 


America gave you Internet? Pmsl
bitch, its 2013 and i&#39;m still here
^^
You don&#39;t know Jack about the Jesuits, the Pope, Catholicism or Alexandre Dumas. Why don&#39;t you spew about the Illuminati, Masons, or The New World Order.  
Ever eat with a Canadian?
Bad Karma?
Americans don&#39;t look down on Canadians, they are after all North of the CONUS. However, Alaskans do look down on some Canadians, because they are for the most part South of Alaska.
Who told you that? Quote from CNN &quot;one of 23 U.S. reactors built with a General Electric-designed containment housing known as the Mark I. Most Mark 1&#39;s came online between 1972 and 1978, making them nearly 40 years old. The NRC is granting 20 year extensions or should I say rubber stamping. containment box is too small and its walls are too thin,waste storage pools, situated several stories above the ground over the main reactor and outside a key containment vessel are vulnerable to meltdown.
People on here bashing nuclear power and so fucking stupid. If you would realize that the Mark I containment for the Fukishima reactors are NOT in the United States. All BWRs in the US have Mark II containments.

The diesel generator and battery design were below the flood level which is a problem. US standards when it comes to safety are two fold that of other nations. I work for a company that design nuclear plants and until you&#39;re in my shoes you&#39;ll never realize the level of safety.
Daughters*
Yeah...
why would americans look down on canadiens?

why is everything in japan falling to shit 
OMG Americans don&#39;t look down on  Canadians WTF???????????????
HOw is that working out for you?
Its funny how Americans look down on Canada and canadians but most of the world like Canada a whole lot better.....
you need to chill a bit so... skaffaaah say sorry TheGlowZombie and then give each other a hug, and be nice.

i just fucked.
unless they are born with blindness.
Whoa you guys just fucked my head
why is america brought up in this when this is japan Nuke plant o.O and why hate americans ? we didnt do shit. our government did shit not us the people. so why call us stupid for what our government we ourselfs here in america hate also. so fuck off us and hate on our government and stop being jealous over what america has and doesnt have.
So before you say Canada and USA is the same think harder next time just because we are in the same Continent doesn&#39;t mean we are the same for example: Just because Italy and Poland are in Europe does that mean they are the same?
They are different i will give you a few examples: we have free health care USA does not, We have more strict gun laws USA doesn&#39;t, we dont fuck with other countries because we dont like them, USA does, We don&#39;t fuck with other countries that we know will beat us at war USA does e.g (Vietnam), we speak with more respect USA does not, we respect other countries USA does not, We dont join every little conflict (war) just because we think we are some bad ass mother fuckers, USA does. 
No, they really aren&#39;t that different. Canada is part of North America just like the US.
Oh please don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re another one of the morons that think that crap is real. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with the young people in the US that they follow this crap blindly and believe every word of it. 
Ne craignez rien les nua
im just gonna break in and say.... im Canadian, Canada and U.S.A (America) is different 
Fuck. 
hey guys respect yourself, dont show to everyone who are you, everybody follow you then,,,
fuck all of you
Teleconference video of TEPCO shows that
TEPCO fabricated lie to announce what kind of explosion occurred by reactor 3.
URL ( linktonews.digi2.jp ): 
The video shows that
the announcement &quot;Only Hydrogen explosion&quot; is fabricated lie.
It means
the announcement
&quot;All spent fuel rods (including Plutonium) still remain in the pool.
No spent fuel rods exploded.
No Plutonium dispersed.&quot;
is fabricated lie, too.
Everybody around the world,
please require TEPCO show that all rods remain in the pool of #3.

The reaction was caused by a super criticalty in the spent fuel rod storage ponds that lost cooling due to the loss of power to the circulation pumps when the basements were flooded after the earthquake. The ponds hold tones of spent,  but hot fuel rods As the water boiled away the rods melted and the ziconium clading reacted to with the water and steam to produce hydrogen and oxgen. The Buildings are not containment building but regular buildings 
what caused the explosion? Obviously not a nuclear explosion.
You know, for an earthquake to cause the explosion, that camera sure mighty damn still!! 
*Shows Glowzombie his improved trollface* 
CO CO COMBO BREAKER ... All jokes aside, I got nothing against america. Infact, I think its such a pretty country that I would almost fuck it. 
Yea bro, your right, the last time we will fuck em all together and fuck em good. 
Bro, I&#39;m with ya. Fuckers need to get fuckt, so fuck Yankelevich and america. 
Yea, glowzombie is right! Don&#39;t fuck him, fuck america. 
Sentence from God !!!

21.12.2012 is Game Over 

Cool, then all Illuminati will fuck in the ass by Luzifer  !
What do you tell the public exactly? that everything is contaminated? that everything is bad for you now?. Firstly that isn&#39;t practical, do you expect people to stop drinking and eating? or breathing?. 

Also as bad as the contamination is from this meltdown that happened, if you only focus on this type of contamination then you are over looking everything else. 
xd
you are completely right. I am sure these things are just as hidden as in the case of Chernobyl.
@YousayOh That&#39;s just a pressure wave turning the water in the air into something more like clouds or the contrails of a plane.. Just look at a plane going supersonic or any other powerful explosion. I&#39;m really glad radiation isn&#39;t your opinion. Everyone has to stop fretting too, you can live a few miles away from this your whole life and still have safe doses of radiation. Chill the fuck out people.

Not a hydrogen O2 explosion and most cetainlky not fusion.  .  No red fire. 

Look up hydrogen implosion.  Two gases combine to make steam = smaller volume than the two,  H and O2 requires to be in liquid form to make a decent propellant.

Thats a weapons grade, or similar type chemical or nuclear explosion.  Was Japan refining weapons grades material?
@YousayOh Thank god physics is not your opinion. Radiation doesn&#39;t work that way.
@MrSouthphillyitalian In japan
i wonder where all the people in japan are living
@N4CR5 Well, yes, which is why I would never want to get involved in it, really. Too much shit to deal with. But if you want to make the world a better place, then help with some privately owned and operated charities. 
@Rosebunse and with a govt job there is no arguing you are not a govt employee and thus not subject to the bs bits of paper they make up and call &#39;law&#39;.
@paarsefrikandel No, I think the Patriot Act just put down on paper what was probably going on before and would go on anyways. Listen, part of the reason why I don&#39;t want a government job is because it&#39;s all one horrible, entertaining game. That&#39;s how it&#39;s viewed by everything in everyone government and movement. If you want to make things better for the world, help with some private charities or something.
@paarsefrikandel Please, not all that. Yes, the attack on Pearl Harbor was probably partially a set-up to get us into WW2, I&#39;ll give you that. But, it worked out best for the US and the world, save for the nuke, though, really, it we hadn&#39;t dropped the bomb, someone else would have sooner or later. That&#39;s not dismissing the horrible consequences, but it&#39;s what happened. Don&#39;t forget about Japan&#39;s human rights violations too.
@maxb8097 Yes, the US&#39;s racism has nothing on you, South Africa LOL
@Rosebunse mine is! oh wait.. we invented apartheid...
@redcat608 Such as what?
@masanamasana At least Japan had a fairly low cancer rate to begin with. I hope that works in their favor now. I would be so scared if I lived in Japan. But what can the Japanese government do? If they told everyone the truth, there would be a serious food shortage and potential disaster. It&#39;s a no win situation.
@proudtobeslavic I know Japan has done HORRIBLE things in the past. Sick, horrible things...But we have to give the Japanese people a chance to get past this history. Besides, no country is guilt-free.
I know nuclear energy is mostly safe, but it&#39;s just the fact about how wrong things can go when something does happen. Especially to such a small place as Japan. 
@Alillan China, Korea, Russia, Phillipphines all hate Japan for some historical reason and ongoing problems
search Nanjing massacre, Japan is a peace-against country.
China will purnish on them when they become a new superpower
@masanamasana 
Bacterial infection is increasing in the flooded area region. 
However, it is a problem different from radioactivity damage. 
@Immakingadifference2 Definitely american.
When I saw this first time, I thought: OK that&#39;s it. The pressure vessel just went off.
@Immakingadifference2 You just went too far.
The book &quot;Fukushima 3/11 &amp; Japan&#39;s Government. WHY IT SUCKS&quot;  is a thoughtful analysis of the 21st century&#39;s first nuclear disaster.
This is a real threat. I just joined a new club called the Global Information Network and we&#39;ve been warned that the US news media will indeed stop talking about the real dangers involved here. Our club exposes these corrupt govt individuals by name worldwide﻿ and they keep us up to date on how we can protect ourselves. If u want to know more, just email me at DannyMilea@yahoo.com . Best of luck everyone and protect yourselves!
I have no idea why so many people here dislike Japan. It&#39;s such an amazing nation with great people.
Enjoy your lives everyone. Remember, watch the movie RUN FROM THE CURE and see if that helps your mental state
no to nuclear =(..
 &quot;My history of my life in my oneself. My trace track distance from 16 years old in my existence. My all in my being. My historical total one selves in present oneself. My historical all﻿ selves in now self.

I rule and control Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan in the world. I save and rescue Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan in the world. I work as my central nucleus as all own﻿ at all﻿ life history trace track distance of total time.&quot;
from Wizardmori...Awesome...
TEPCO has claimed that what you are seeing in this video is simply a bunch of teenagers exploding an M-80 in the vicinity of the Fukushima plant. 
so guys, where can i get more information about what the fuck is going on in fukushima, you don&#39;t hear bullshit from it anymore. I am 100% sure this shit has not ended, but yeah. I bet my two nuts that the government is playing it down saying the radiation is at an acceptable level. Bullshit
frequent earthquakes japan nuclear power plant is suicide
Whaaa?

@neston24 

Although I don&#39;t like the idea of dolphins being killed, you posted this in a very inappropriate place.

@stefanmetodijev 

I don&#39;t know where to start, your idiocy knows no bounds.

@neston24 No! I&#39;m on the side of the 15cm to 20cm fish
The only thing is that you collaborate fast to stop the killings of our brothers dolphins.
 Just click::
w w w.causes.com/causes/331088

Yor click save a anima,l tanks ...

They eat fish from 15 cm to 20 cm, but this does not mean they should kill them because they are animals who reason, suffer the pain of a loved one.
 I think you would not want a killer, stick a knife in his mother or a family member.

@neston24 Dolphins are murderers
I cannot believe there is so much evil in a human, a dolphin is a so
loved animal by everyone, but being massacred in this way.
I think Nature returned blood as a tsunami. There´s so much hate in
all this kills in Taiji. I can’t describe in words, I really feel sad
and I hate your nation. The only thing I have to say is not to come
visiting America because you are not going to be welcome.

@Jai666666666 

Um, there are no nuke plants on Long Island, there was one, Brookhaven, it was dismantled 20 years ago
Well, we get all the information here in Japan we need! Japanese TV, radio and other media like Magazines and Newspapers informing very well about every little detail. Just they are more down to earth and don&#39;t write exciting stories like CNN and BBC etc only to make the most money. 
All information I get from universities and my own research, match the data and facts provided almost real time to us in Japan! 
The situation is serious enough, no need to make more out of it than it actually is!
@fuckmania07 That preety sound&#39;s like a blackmail to me..
Good give us a choice
@RashidDostum Havn&#39;t got a clue what I have commented previously on this video or what you are responding to. I guess it was so long ago I don&#39;t really give a shit so can&#39;t be arsed trying to make sense of your comment. I&#39;m going to get rid of my crisis boner. Don&#39;t worry it will be a happy ending as long as I keep watching radiation videos and Japanese suffering. Heck maybe just foreign suffering. Care to join me or do you want to fuck off?
☢ ☣= ☠
Watch the documentary, &quot;The True Battle of Chernobyl Uncensored&quot; Its right here on Youtube.... Lot of parallels here

@fuckmania07 Dude, with all due respect, Im a Christian too, and I wont lie, Im not like those absolute 100% Jesus freaks that live by the craziest rules and are really strict cause they misinterpret the bible and stuff, like i curse and i do crap n whatever, im a regular guy, but if you plan on advertising our religion, i suggest you should change your name before hand.. it kinda makes us look bad, no offense dude
We need to think about switching to safer ways of power so we don&#39;t rely on nuclear power. Watch the &quot;Nuclear Ninjas&quot; video its really interesting
@oohmikel 
@RashidDostum
 Laugh and whine and make excuses all you want, i&#39;m used to it!..
What about disputing the claims and even present an alternative solution??...
Asking too much probably!!!...
Some people like to be part of the problem, or maybe they don&#39;t know much better!
Facts are, that this is a SIMPLE ENGINEERING PROBLEM, but for most of you is a COMPLICATED ENGINEERING PROBLEM!....Typical!
 Just liker the BP crisis, the TEPCO charade,  could be solved in days...
We could have had full solar power decades ago but the utility companies can&#39;t figure out how to put a meter on a sunbeam.
The choice is before us. Kill nuclear power or nuclear power will kill us all.
@RashidDostum i had a good laugh also! rotfl
see all that smoke? this is how japan does it on 420.
Has this visual of this explosion been confirmed to be consistent with a HYDROGEN blast?  A frame-by-frame analysis of the original video could be viewed by experts and the behavior and characteristics of the explosion identifiable.

Has a ballistics investigation been conducted to assure that no foul play was involved?

In a case of this magnitude and international significance, these questions are ABSOLUTELY due diligence.
This is criminal behavior by an elite that looks down on you and always puts profits above all else.

We proposed a  solution to the problem with unmanned vehicles[see it at  korvelo.com ---- to laughs from various idiots] what they are now using to inspect the reactor. If you can build a toy robot to go inside the reactor you can also build  a bigger one to fix the problems they have!
It seems too much for the stupid engineers at TEPCO!
I can show them how for free!
Shame on you Japan!!!
&#39;Nuclear Ginza&#39; is a 1995 documentary about the Japanese nuclear industry. To become better informed watch it now on youtube.
Because the Japanese Government was inconvenient because election was near, I kept a tight lid on a fact to the nation with the quantity that measured radioactivity. But the election suffered a crushing defeat
they better hurry and get it fixed or godzilla will be created

Take heed to God&#39;s forewarnings before it was &quot;too late&quot;! (See Mark 1:15; Luke 13:5; Acts 2:38; Read also Three Days of Darkness...) Otherwise, you yourself and the devil (See John 8:44), not God, will punish you yourself in hell for all eternity! Jesus said: &quot;For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?&quot; (Matt.16:26)

There is one of the last film of great Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa from 1990, called &quot;Yume&quot; (&quot;Dreams&quot; I think). You&#39;d be shocked how much universal truth he put there, including nuclear threat not so far from this Fukushima nowadays :/ From one side it&#39;s pity that such visions fulfill itself. This genius showed it to people &gt;20 years ago (after 1st world lesson). From other side, what conclusion can You think of while seeing kids playing with matches in front of You. [&#39;] for victims.
wow
Holy Fukushima!
japan really fuckd  up....

more pollution hooray


THIS CLOWNS LOOK LIKE FROM THE SAME SCHOOL AS BP ENGINEERS......You need to remove the fricking fuel rods from the reactor ASSHOLES!!!

HOW YOU DO THAT?....SIMPLE!

GET A FEW UNNAMED VEHICLES AND ROBOTS TO REMOVE THEM ONE BY ONE AND PUT THEM IN PROPERLY DESIGNED TAKE-AWAY CONTAINERS
@melgimson just think of all of the children and babies that were just sitting there watching tv and then everything went blank! raicist much?
BREAKING NEWS! 
The nuclear industry has just found out that Superman is in fact a comic book hero. This shocking discovery has caused them to scrap their emergency preparedness plan. 
The alternative plan is a robot with a hosepipe.
This is mass murder through greed and negligence.
radiation is bad dont go near radiation
@MrGreatLakesBuffalo gj you live in the pass. so why arnt you blaming the germans too? after that maybe russia comes to you mind...
ahhh the glorious youtube comments.  The most vile comments ever, and the bleeding heart  jump in and fall right into their trap with comments about how people are uneducated... does it ever get old?
@Stevan223 George Bush is the caused this wreckage. All hail Obama!!
This is what corporate greed ultimately leads to.
If the Japanese had opposed to nuclear, instead of allowing energy corporations ruin everybody&#39;s life and mess with the environment, now they would be not soffering the consequences of nuclear radiation... and this is just the beginning!
@Hector49er Sorry One &quot;0&quot; is missing! Two times! ;-)
In Japanese news,No.3 reactor of Fukushima first plant doesn&#39;t melt down.
By hydrogen explosion,the roof of No.3 reactor blew off, but that pressure container didn&#39;t be broken.
Now, water for colling down nucleus is leaking from the duct of that pressure container.

In all of history, there weren&#39;t video cameras. Consumer video cameras only came around in the past 20 years. This isn&#39;t the end of days. It&#39;s the start of YouTube. (And your claims about a recent surge of disasters reflects your [probably willful] ignorance of the history of disasters.) Show some more respect for the many who have died tragically through history, and stop pretending it all just started happening to _you_.

@Hector49er : Well spotted! I mean 100.000 years! All 2,5 Years that would be too much!
You are to religious.... it&#39;s the nature, whose doing this.. not god &gt;.&lt; 
We need to respect nature.
God uses signs to alert mankind, because God wants to save all. If you do not take heed to God’s warnings... when disasters and deaths come... You yourself &amp; the devil, not God, will punish you yourself in hell for all eternity...On the othe hands, if you take heed... God will protect… or give you eternal life...

I wonder if Liquid Nitrogen could be used to help cool it down!?
Governments told us: Nuclear power is safe! A nuclear desaster could happen max. all 10.000 yars!! BUT: We have about 4.000 nuclear plants worldwide! So we have to calculate: 10.000 : 4.000 = 25 !! So we have to expect one nuclear desaster all 25 years! Very safe! So, who will be the next? In 2036? But thats statistics! It could happen every day...

@BrandNewSongz Oh yeah

@g17y5wb Try to understand what you wrote becasue it does not make any sense to me. 
@andrew33323 instead of a bomb going off giving large masses of radiation doses into the atmosphere at once, the power plants leaks radiation around them slowly, unleashing radioactive waste in the environment. To contain radio active waste you have to cover it with something,but eventually the spent rods will leaks around and penetrate any object in time. Spent fuel rods can still remain radioctive between 25,000 and 50,000 years. So whos going to take care of these for the next 250 centuries?
@Blado1988 Not only the cancer rates will rise in the future, but for future generations to come. Anyone effected by radiation now has their DNA damaged to a degree that it is urepiarable. When these people have kids the defected DNA is passed down to their children causing birth brain and other abnormalities. In the world todat a staggering 1 out of 8 people will have cancer in their lifetimes, that is probablay around %15 of the world population. outcome They will blame it on lifestyle choices
@g17y5wb Humans have become too dependent on man made resources instead of natural resources. Not only do these man made substances pollute our environment, it also contaminates the air and water around us. How did humans survive on this planet 1000 years ago. Obviously they were not using laptops or eating uranium. Why do we need to geneticly modify foods or these certain other DNA modifications.Their is no Social policy for humans the Stock markets takes juristiction over and human lives cost.
@AntinuclearNutrition 
Man fuck you bro. Fucking scumbag trying to make a buck off of panic. 
another reason nuclear bombs are dangrous.its only used  in world war 2 and  in accidents.the goverments are scared that if they dont have it they will be bombed. now i like science but nuclear bombs are evil!!!
another reason nuclear bombs are dangrous.its only used them in world war 2 and  in accidents.the goverments are scared that if they dont have it they will be bombed. now i like science but nuclear bombs are evil!!!
yeah great more future cancer cases being blasted into the atmosphear, water and food. they&#39;ll just blaim it on lifestyle and genetics like they always do.
@ShAdZ3000 The earth is a cealed area the radiation wont go away it will stay within our atmosphere and travel around the world being pushed by the winds 
ooooooh
People, don&#39;t believe the fairy tale, that nuclear energy is needed to keep down the greenhouse effect! It is no Option, to risk all 10-20 years a new nuclear contamined spot in the world! Change is possible within a few years!
Human race was able to built a technic like the atomic bomb in about two years! 
No we have to hurry up to advance existing green technologies and invent new ones! 
Yeah I&#39;m might be one of the happiest people alive cuz of this I jus hope itll hit Korea china and that&#39;s it no where else the first of three have been  hit score jus don&#39;t hit the us
@bombjapan words can not explain how much I hate you.
@underterraingrunter as far as we know that did not happen. if the spent fuel rods had been ejected from the pool in number 3, the workers would be dropping dead like flys from the hundreds of scattered fuel rods all over the plant. 
See? Nothing to worry about!
the new chernobyl
Egypt, then Libya, then Japan, whats next. . . 
@randomjunk666 shut up its not funny at all 
these videos are not to be liked :(
@Cee6th 100% correct,,its the best thing in the world to something goes wrong,,then all the nobodys and people who fail at everything in life jump up and down using what the media is telling them as facts hahaha
@thebamfordman o really and your credititaion gives you the right to tell everyone how it is??? what do you do for a living keyboard warrior ???

@korvelo Sounds like you have not been paying much attention to the news, and you didn&#39;t even bother to research before you showed your lack of knowledge to the whole world. They have back ups, multiple back ups, and the best in the world. They were all damanged from massive earthquake, and then tsunami. Remove the exposed rods? You want to release uncontrollable amount of lethal dose of radiation into the air? They are filling water and it is working. Temp dropped.
Shame on you JAPAN, SHAME ON YOU!

WHERE ARE THE BACK-UP COOLING SYSTEMS?

WHERE ARE THE UNMANNED SPECIAL VEHICLES TO REMOVE THE EXPOSED RODS?

WHERE ARE THE UNMANNED HELICOPTERS?

SOME WAY YOU BUILD DISPOSABLE CARS ,YOU BUILD DISPOSABLE NUCLEAR REACTORS.........ALL FOR A QUICK YEN, SCREW SAFETY!!!

Number 3 is the most lethal so far. That explosion ejected around 80 tons of uranium and plutonium. 
Fukushima Dirty Bomb. 

- Only when the last tree dies
- and the last river is poisoned

Now there&#39;s radioactive waste and uranium dust all over the country !!

40% chance of becoming a mutant.

Download the movie &quot;China Syndrome&quot; from 1979.  Sound familiar??  Where are all the &quot;experts&quot; now  who said that nuclear power is so safe, and we are the dumb ones for being opposed to the use of such a dangerous method of boiling water? They all said it was fullproof. A &quot;safe&quot; technology. Now where are they?  They should be the ones going in to the reactor. 
0:06  white flash @wavepsychic
this is all because they put the generators below sea level!!!!  If they focused more on backup power, than straight profits, this would not be happening!!! FACT!!!!!!!!!!! 
@TurkishSuperGuy  If you really believe that GTFO your computer. Your computer contains elements that are deposited deeper than uranium.  Do you know what lanthanum or palladium are? Well they might be in the computer you used to type this. Ever been to a hospital. Do you know how many people are saved by radiation and elements dug up from &quot;hell&quot;.  If you really want humans to cut back kill about half the population. &quot;God&quot; gave us barely nothing. Science and reason gave us everything.
@TheMongolo ......well then I guess we are fucked....
why do human beings have to exploit the natrual resources to satisfie their own needs? This is what happens when you dig deep below when you should not, even the devil would say leave me alone or else I will come back to haunt you. their are abundant resources on the surface of this planet, God gave plenty to man o&#39;adam to. But Human greed has only encouraged devistation and had brun up evil on top of the surface and destroyed himself in the end for years to come. Mankinds LastChaptr,verse Finl

One tip: Don&#39;t use free-translation! Thats crap!: -)
@g17y5wb 

Natural disasters were handled better in the days of the Shoguns!  I&#39;m old enough to remember the brutal handling of the Kobe 95&#39; earthquake.
I know this sounds wrong, but one would think that after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan would be the last country on Earth that would want anything to do with nuclear power. 
fallout approaching

Ach und wenn Du schon meine Grammatik ansprichst, bist Du denn in der Lage irgendeine andere Sprache zu verstehen, ausser Deiner eigenen?
If you can&#39;t read it, ask someone with education to translate!
Fucking Media Giving Nuclear Power a bad name. Well if we start fucking up the earth with fossil fuels global warming will make that tsunami 100 times worse and fucking kill millions of people. Theve already got the situation under control. Chenobly only happened because half stone age farmer retards fucked up shit. Nuclear is a good solotion to global warming
why is the government not looking out for the people that have now been exposed to radio-activity????????? wtf??????
@g17y5wb : Doesn&#39;t your parents tell you, not to use the Computer, when they are not at home?
So go to bed, but with hands over the blanket!
Plutonium is in all spent fuel rods. It&#39;s a byproduct of fission. Reactors 1,2,3,4,5 &amp; 6 have plutonium in the spent fuel they store on sight.
@boggleo I know what was destroyed by looking at close up photos. Also by looking at diagrams of the mark 1.
@nly8nchz  Sow hat is the radiation level then , they said in the media its lv 6 and 4000 radioation points near the reactor was it a lie? and how about the new explosion anybody has any ideas what is going on??
&quot;FUKUSHIMA MELTDOWN&quot;
3.18.2011
As worn by the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: Yesterday was Armageddon, today we have a serious problem. 

The Japanese will deal with this as they always have, that is to say, to the best of their abilities, but outside assistance will not be refused and should be wholeheartedly offered... There is nothing more to argue about.
@nikvin lol, same here. Well,hope they&#39;ll share their D.N.A with us at least.
bcuz Life sux without supapowerr ! ~ seriously.
@nly8nchz Get the fuck out of here. You are obviously trying to downplay everything for some reason. Your trying way to hard. What happened to spent rod pool#3 if you look at the pictures it is obviously gone. Rods full of MOX exploded into the sky and know one is talking about it.
who owns Fukushima nuke plant  i herd somewhere canada does, can anyone tell me 
ILLUMINATI CAUSED IT

@blogposter Haven&#39;t you heard, the Mayans were just trying to freak people out... lol
@nly8nchz You are wrong. #3 spent rod pool is not intact. How can you say that when pictures clearly show it was destroyed in the blast. It is not where it should be. How could it when the floor were it was located is ether collapsed or blown into the sky. The pictures don&#39;t lie people do.
Have you guys seen the movie JAWS? They won&#39;t close down the beaches until 4 or 5 people get eaten by the shark.
Cmon guys, if you are in the US think about it!! It woud take 40 mile perhour winds at a constant rate for about 15 hours plus a slight uprising wind to keep the radioactive particles from dropping in the sea to get to here.....oh and btw I hope the best for the japanese people

@BrandNewSongz Yeah. That would be really cool. I wish i was in Japan so Id be a supper hero. :)
The thing is that liquid nitrogen might help more but they can&#39;t get to close to the opening. The chopper flys over dumping water but barely gets any that hits the reactor because they are so high up. If we want to cool those reactors it is going to be a 1-10 person suicide mission unless they can get the emergency cooling system back up and running.
Yes it could be dangerous to introduce 2 extreme temperatures to each other very rapidly. But Liquid Nitrogen has supreme cooling power. I am just looking for thoughts on this because it popped in my head. Depends on the actual temps of the reactor vessel i guess. Leidenfrost Effect might play a role also.
@screwmachine6 yeah, but you dont want to cool it too much, or it might damage the reactor because it could make it too cold.
You could dump liquid nitrogen from a chopper just as easy as water.
Liquid nitrogen here in the US is pretty abundant. I see tanker trucks full of it driving around all the time.
What about liquid nitrogen to cool reactors? i&#39;m not a chemist so idk if this is possible but sure sounds like a good idea to me.
@gkhadz 
uhhhhhh Radiation IS a big deal bud
Although and because the situation in Fukushima is very critical: The Japanes can manage the crisis and WILL manage the crisis.
In no other country so many man are willing to sacrifice them for the live of all Japanese and the whole nation!

German Newspaper and TV reporting all day long from the Japanese &quot;Himmelfahrtskommando&quot;, the brave few, who sacrifice them . We in Germany know the Himmelfahrtskommando from our soldiers in WWII. 

@Wuchtamsel  yes indeed I do,those soft&quot; and effective methods of force&quot; are used in western countries more so than what I saw in the communist countries,I got to see the good old hard stuff,those  ways are used here in the USA on the job,ratty cut throats,Japan to a more severe extent to where it will effect the families for careers for generations,I&#39;m not talking about hot rad dose rates either,they still have a choice,it&#39;s a perceived threat common to their society &amp; the way they think
@bla7091 : ... And then the toxic-waste-industries! I, for myself, imagine, that they handle nuclear waste very careful! Do you hear about &quot;Asse&quot; in Germany? They didn&#39;t staple the waste, no, they thrown it in a mine-duct, and put some sand over it! No one can know anymore, if one barrel is damaged! Now we have to pay 3-4 Billion Euro to regenerate it!
@bla7091: I know what for a blast is to see there! A hydrogen/oxygen-reaction!
btw: There are existing several studies, that it is possible to get out from nuclear-energy within a few years!
The point is: I can&#39;t trust them! Before a few days, they shown a reporte from an german plant! And coincidental there was a error-Announcement! NO one knew, what is to do! They read for ten minutes in a handbook, have to phone two times, because they don&#39;t understood, what they read! ...

@SittingBull4448 I&#39;m not just talking about Germany here. If one country produces less energy with one source, you can bet that somewhere else, more energy needs to be produced and through conventional methods.
I wouldn&#39;t say nuclear energy is THE way to go, but for now it may just be the best transition we have available because at the moment we&#39;re still relying heavily on fossil fuels. Btw, the blast you see here is a chemical reaction, not a nuclear one
@bla7091: We don&#39;t need more oil an gas! Germany has produced about 20% more Energy, than needed!
But, what do you want to tell me? That it isn&#39;t possible to stop nuclear energy ? Than you are not up to date! 
And that 30% of European energy is made by nuclear power is no reason to do not start another way!
Lets talk next time, perhaps when one of our &quot;safe&quot; European nuclear plants blast off!
@SittingBull4448 Yeah they switched off 7 nuclear plants and just use more oil/gas to power the fossil plants. Oil prices dropped since Japan reduced their import so it&#39;s pretty easy to cover up for 7 nuclear plants. At the time speaking, roughly one third of all electricity produced in Europe comes from nuclear sources
Homer Simpson was working that day...
@gkhadz Ok but they just said the radiation in the plans is now 4000  but i dont think this  will be as bad as  chernobyl
@gkhadz Yes, people should stop the hysteria, however, let&#39;s not pretend this isn&#39;t a horrible disaster. There are at least 4 reactors out of control, and they are not giving information about what is going on there. There is MOX fuel in #3. People in Japan have the right to be concerned. People in US need a chill pill on the other hand. Radiation gets into food, water..environment. They aren&#39;t giving information, they just say everything fine. Doesn&#39;t that remind you of something?
@blogposter: Can tell you: The Mayas did have seen the power, which youtube, facebook and other networks have in this time and can&#39;t believe about so many stupid comments!
See you at december, 22, 2012..
@gareyt17 thats not gonna be good... if they dont cool down the fuel then japans gonna be chernobyl 2
They build disposable, unsafe  cars, no wonder they build nuclear power plants with the same philosophy...!!
THIS IS JUST STUPID AND IRRESPONSIBLE AND ALL NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS ARE BUILT THE SAME WAY....!!!!
This people lives in a fantasy world, where disasters happen to everyone but them.............IDIOTS!

WHERE IS THE BACK UP COOLING SYSTEM AND THE BACK UP, FOR THE BACK UP?....................... INTELLIGENT AND ADVANCED INDEED.............!!!!
STOP hysteria. BE reasonable. Japan got struck by nuclear weapons in 1945. This disaster is no near to Chernobyl. BE REASONABLE. BE SAFE. STOP HYSTERIA!

Help Japan! 原子力行政「胸を張るべきだ」　経団連会長が発言（03/17 10:55）
北海道新聞web  
　日本経団連の米倉弘昌会長は１６日、東京都内で記者団に対し、福島第１原発の事故について「千年に１度の津波に耐えているのは素晴らしいこと。原子力行政はもっと胸を張るべきだ」と述べ、国と東京電力を擁護した。米スリーマイルアイランドの原発事故を上回る重大事故との見方が強いだけに、発言は波紋を広げそうだ。米倉会長は事故は徐々に収束の方向に向かっているとし「原子力行政が曲がり角に来ているとは思っていない」と発言。「政府は不安感を起こさないよう、正確な情報を提供してほしい」と話した。一方、日本商工会議所の岡村正会頭は同日開かれた定例会見で「放射能の放出は、国民が最も不安を抱く。正確かつ迅速な情報提供を望む」と要望。
@ndc18iiii Its taking long enough.
@RashidDostum And you sir, make and utterly pointless and insulting retort. Maybe it is you who is small minded. Feel free to express your opinion but do so in a polite manner. If you can&#39;t do that then you can just piss off mate :)
The fact that a spent fuel rod cooling pool was blown sky high does not seem to be getting much attention. There is no sign of the pool which was located on the roof of containment building #3. Whats up with that?
@Wuchtamsel How do you know they forced them?? If they did,that news to me.
We&#39;re already dead...!!!
WATCH this and SPREAD!!!

@jeffsandychelsea Does it really matter if there is an &quot;all powerful&quot; god or not? We are here, and this god doesn&#39;t even seem to have things under control. We are the ones fucking nature up, so we have fix what we are able to and save who we can. After we have done all we can, we can ask for this god&#39;s help. I am not a religious man, but i feel that after providing every resource, it can&#39;t possibly hurt to pray for those who have died.

People can eat food, but people can&#39;t eat prayers

Nuclear power plants in Japan are simply a bad idea... Japan itself is a giant fault line.... in most other countries they would probably be fine other than the fact that it takes over 10,000 years for nuclear waste to biodegrade lol
@RashidDostum They are also going to use helicopter water carriers because one of the ponds used for the cooling towers has run out of water
@bla7091: We made 16% of green energy in the LAST 15 years!
It could&#39;be 25, but nuclear industrie produce too much! These days Germany switch off 7 nuclear plants without any problems and without importing energy! OK, German Government plays it&#39;s own game and is nuclear-friendly, but they know, that the people of Germany mostley don&#39;t want nuclear power!
@TheBostonBomb So much for being &quot;all powerful&quot;...
Never forget the Fukushima 50, for these workers sacrificed their lives to delay the inevitable nuclear disaster. Still working in the irradiated plant, these men continue the desperate fight after hundreds of their coworkers had left. It is imposible to fore tell what will happen in the days to come but no matter how bad things get we have to keep these brave souls in our hearts and prayers.

Remember to help the ones you can and pray for the ones you cant, because God cant handle this himself.
@bla7091 
Its not negative - its just needs more efforts. We`ll see whats ITER will demonstrate. If it succeeds - it will be equal to discovery of fire and reach of outer space.

No &quot;green energy&quot; can provide new technological leap ahead
@bla7091 
Sorry but we are. Most reactors use Uranium at 3-6% enriched by U-235 isotope - this is relatively rare isotpe. But there is U-238 - so called Depleted Uranium - a cheap ass toxic waste - so cheap and abundant that they use it to make projectiles for cannons. 1$ per kilo. 
Case is that there is channel reactors like RMBK which eat even 1,5% U-235. And there is fast neutron reactors that massively reproduce Pu-239 AND U-235. So actualy - we have infinite fuel
@MarshallJukov Fusion, good point! Definitely worth the research and if we can actually pull it off (tried for some 5 decades, still running negative) it can be the solution to all our energy needs.

@MarshallJukov Well unlike what you seem to assume here, is that we have an infinite supply of nuclear fission fuel. We don&#39;t.
The uranium we commonly use is easily harvested at the moment, but it will not last forever either. Especially not if we speed up our consumption of it, so nuclear fission is more like a semi-switch in between to temporarily replace fossil fuels
@bla7091 
Its not about oil - nuclear power can give energy forever. Unlike solar cells which serve only few years and have no chance to give back energy spent on their very production. 
I repeat - solar cells in average take 5 times more energy to produce then than those cells themselves produce before they need to be replaced. Period. 

We need just to build more modern and safe reactors, retire old reactors and move to fusion energy
@MarshallJukov If you wait long enough any energy investment can earn itself back. Cost shouldnt be the restrictive factor here, when oil prices get high enough (or oil runs out) we&#39;d be willing to pay anything for energy.
Surely it can take a few months till you earn back what you originally put into producing your panel... but something that is self-providing can always earn itselfback
@RashidDostum I don&#39;t think copper wires would be a suitable way to distribute energy across the entire globe. Electrolysing sea water into hydrogen (and oxygen) is probably a better way to carry energy over long distances (high energy density per mass, can be used to power practically everything)
Although copper could work for neighbouring countries of a solar/wind plant
@SittingBull4448 That&#39;s what every government says, that they&#39;ll be producing green enery in some 10-15 years. Notice how the 10-15 years restart at every new election. 
Green energy is a tiny fraction of our total consumption and it will remain that way for quite some time
@demontenk its very naive to truly beleive that all the japanese are innocent , cause when katrina happened here all you saw was people taking food from stores, and they called it looting. but when a disaster happens in japan the media blocks out all the deaths murders rapes abuse etc that goes on during this crisis just sayign do not be so naive 
@steven4rmnewyork  Judging from your other comments, you&#39;re a racist and ignorant piece of shit. That is all

What happened to the spent fuel stored at 1 2 &amp; 3 my guess is that it was blown sky high in the explosions. Nothing in the news about that or is it only 4 5 &amp; 6 that have spent fuel rods soaking in tubs outside the containment unit.

We already don&#39;t have gasoline more.
We got many earthquake in this time.
My area was not broken.
sorry poor english.



This reminds me of the BP oil spill. Governments and corporations tell us that the threat is minimal because they know the damage won&#39;t be apparent immediately. If these reactors continue melting down, in 10 years cancer rates are going to sky rocket along the pacific. 
Lets hope that japan doesnt turn into a new chernobyl.
@patrick60495 LOL WTF
@CarlosMarioMedellin They have people who have hands. Cant concrete untill after a complete meltdown.
There has got to be a way to seal the reactor with concrete. Japan are knows for their robots. Can´t they invent a damn robot that will level the place with concrete and stop the radiation threat.
Apparently there were sightings of the Enola Gay overhead prior to the explosion and what seemed to be a dolphin and whale piloting it.
@Lovem123100 umm dude your praying for just russia? sure, there the main place we are concerned about but we need to pray for other places to dude the radiation leak might cause the entire world to die..... then again this might not be true speaking there is nothing about a nuclear power plant on fox news OR the news on T.V just youtube and a few other sites........

@stex6109 burning coal doesn&#39;t produce nuclear radiation...now, pollution it does produce...
no to ladnie kurwa 2 czarnobyl  :(
@wowiraptor &quot;Nukes&quot; are our only source for technetium-99m (12 hour life span, meaning you can&#39;t stock pile it), which 80% of medical tests rely on. The heat per unit of volume is highest for Nukes, Coal, then Nat gas. Thus, when taking into account the cost of fuel, the cost per kW/h is lowest for Nukes, Coal, then Nat gas...that&#39;s ONE of the reasons we have so many Coal-fired plants and two reasons we have 104 nuclear reactors (which aren&#39;t enough to produce the needed technetium-99m)

@M3TurboE46 How can you be so certain?? especially about something that NOBODY knows or &quot;reports&quot; they are very strict with handling information in japan , and there must be a media lockout because it&#39;s hard to beleive that none of that is going on. 
Japan. the only country that been nuked 4 times....... Japan diserves better than all of this bad luck :(
@hyprvypr HAHA who&#39;s the idiot now.  hmm Have fun breathing in MOX fuel.  The world needed to get rid of you haters anyways.
nieźle jebło, trzymajcie się tam w Japonii!
Should have bought CANDU reactors, not these fucking GE yankee ticking time bomb pieces of shit!
This is very scarey footage.
@bla7091   It has been discovered that Afganistan has likely the biggest supply of lithium in the world at the moment.  And poppies.  Lots of reasons why we are all over them like flies on poop.
@bla7091 
Not to mention that to produce every solar power cell you need FIVE TIMES more energy than this cell itself will ever produce
@HelmutVillam If that is all that has happened and the housing is still intact then that indeed is true.
However the public are not being told the truth by the media. There is conflicting info being reported. Photos were released of this building after the event showing apparent damage to the roof. However from the video above you can physically see the whole building being destroyed. The live geiger counter in Tokyo has also gone offline as the winds have started to shift.
@SittingBull4448 We need to cover a huge area with solar panels, so large we need 200 years worth of global glass production to cover it. Next, we need lithium... which is not really abundant on earth.
It really takes a few decades and heck a lot of money to switch over to harvesting solar energy. And then we haven\t even thought about how to distribute it across the globe
@C64Music a taka logika że bez tych elektrowni miasto by nie funkcjonowało by żre za dużo prądu i inne alternatywne elektrownie nie dałyby rady zasilić miasta. Teraz po katastrofie nie ma kto odbierać prądu i bum.
@MokomaSusi : Didn&#39;t say anything of coal! The transition works with gas-power!
But finally, we have to recognize, that the sun is producing every day more energy, then we are able to consume!
thumbs up if you&#39;re watching this because of Japan.
@IamChinesePatriot You&#39;re just embarising yourself, quit that, seriusly, for your own good.
No politician can tell anymore, that nuclear power is &quot;safe&quot; !
Switch them off! All over the world!
Sun is producing enough energy for all of us!
At around 0:24 the building is hiding the lower right side of the tower.
After explosion at 0:26 you can see the complete lower right side exposed.
So, roof was not blown off - the WHOLE BUILDING was destroyed.
The reactor blew - that&#39;s MELTDOWN.
No matter where you are - take iodine.

ciekwe ilu zginęło podczas wybuchu :-/
@vobis8 idiota! ;/
Ja JAPONIA jest popierdolona  na maxa  budują reaktory atomowe tam gdzie 4 płyty tektoniczne  sa koło siebie 
Usually the melt-down occurs due to the loss of primary / secondry/emergency Coolant  &quot;i.e. LOCA&quot; I wonder if they had time to achieve SCRAM State... or is the Fission still going on ..........!!!
Japan military need to take lots of concrete and lead go there with helicopters and spill concrete mixed with lead on reactors .
@TheIxtlan 
Yeah, &#39;cause &quot;God&quot; sure loves to fuck around with the forces of nature, ehh?
@drcaos They dont seem to be doing so well at the moment...and now thier talking about wind direction and radiation in the air
@agenthelios1 Calm down, I´m sure that they will solve this. 
No worry Everyting under control here!!!
@agenthelios1 corporation will try to have &quot;dead peasants&quot; on us!
May 21,
@JoaquinaKeaton65 
wtf are these things? where do you put that in? 
Cannot wait till this shit meltsdown and fucks on the worst countries in the world ( The U.S asia and of course russia) long live the king
Let me see, Dec21, 2012 the world as we know it is perdicted to end. A nuclear threat after the largest earthquake in Japan`s history? And fallout and more potential deaths worldwide? I`m just saying, but if you haven`t accepted JESUS CHRIST by now then you`re pushing it my friends.


92 people dislike Japan blowing up. What the fucks wrong with you 92 people. Purl Harbur.
@hansbo11 Works better than having no life on the internet.
@Beau1K Sure does work better than having no life on the internet.
dear god  we are fuked send jebus
@DragonDriver100 

radioactive steam? your joking right?
hahahaha...support through prayer...what a joke!  They need FOOD, WATER, FUEL - not prayer please give me a break!!!!!! Freaks!
That&#39;s incredible what&#39;s happened in Japan. Really hope nothing else goes wrong there and that they can get all those people help who need it. 
If the four reactors at Fukushima Daiichi go to full meltdown, expect up to 100 million deaths, including west coast U.S.  Prepare for death.  Pray for God to save humanity.
Report said third explosion happened inside the containment vessel and that radiation is spewing out of the reactor.
fuck you people for spamming such a stupid site on this tragic disaster
Radiation could strike california if those nuclear plants melt down...!!
It&#39;s not looking good. The steam they are venting is radioactive. Undamaged fuel rods produce steam with small amounts of radiation. If the rods melt which they are the steam becomes more radioactive. The reactor building that just exploded contains MOX which let&#39;s off even dirtier steam.
@smiles1969able did the reactor blow or did the building that houses the containment unit explode.
I&#39;m so sick of the words MAY and MIGHT when describing if the rods are melting. We must assume they ARE. 17 Americans contaminated with radiation. They flew in on a releaf mission. It&#39;s ok we washed them off with soap and water. There fine now.
@JCedition1 done. 
@GRATZIANI2002 During shutdown the fuel rods are submerged in water to cool them down.
@TheJay9002 couldnt u use your earlobes to hit the caps button so it doesn&#39;t look like your angry 
@JCedition1 I WAS BORN WITHOUT FINGERS SO I MUST USE MY EARLOBE TO TYPE LETTERS :(
@DR4PEPER the japanese government along with the mainstream media is covering up the real danger of the meltdowns..  it wasnt until alternative media had to push it out in the open, then they started talking about it... all in all dont trust your government or the communist news networks, because your gonna find yourself hanging out to dry... 
@TheJay9002 ok answer my last question y are you writing in caps
@JCedition1 NO ITS OK OVER HERE IF I COMMIT A CRIME BECAUSE THE MEN AREN&#39;T ALL GAY IN JAIL IM NOT THAT INTERESTED I JUST WONDERED WHY AMERICANS BEHAVE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY SHOW DOCUMENTARIES ON THE TV
@myrtiswashington Quote &quot;there exists a ton of vids out there you don&#39;t﻿ recognize is there you actually have got to look at this&quot; -- gibberish, my dear fellow, completely meaningless, what ever are you trying to say?
@JCedition1 IN EUROPE PEOPLE ARE ATTACKED AND STABBED FOR GAY SEX IN JAILS. FOR SOME REASON AMERICAN MEN JUST LOVE TO BEND EACH OTHER OVER AND SATISFY EACH OTHER IN AN EXTREMELY GAY MANNER WHEN THEY GET ARRESTED. I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND IT. WHY ARE YOU SO GAY? THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT BUT PERSONALLY I WOULD BE MASSIVELY OFFENDED IF SOMEONE TRIED TO STICK HIS PENIS IN MY ANAL PASAGE 
@BlackOpsInsaneClips uhhm good idea but...... how to get the power off the island to the city i mean an nuklear exlosion is big like real BIG 
they new it could explode from adding sea water, that doesn&#39;t mean it damaged the reactor.
what you just said made absolutely no sense.
@TheJay9002 when your in jail and your not getting any you only have one other option.....(and its also not only in america ... its in mostly every jail cell ...... and y do you keep writing in caps
wow... over a million views.. i hope people are starting to wake up about the world around them... and how corrupt their governments are...
Chances of it exploding are about 1 / 100
JESTEM KECZUPEM
President Obama  has no plans to change the U.S. approach to energy policy despite the possible meltdown of as many as three nuclear reactors in Japan following a massive earthquake and tsunami, the White House announced Monday.

WHY?
Because they need money to explode the planet and skip off in a spacecraft!
Kidding? Maybe...
@TheMonglo 
The French Government has already acused Japan for withholding information. And Japaneese engeneers don&#39;t exclude the hipothesis for meltdown of the three reactors. They say it&#39;s really a problem. Look up at the Fox News...
@nly8nchz Because as we all know on this type of situations if there was a catastrophic meltdown, the government would come out and say &quot;We have determined that there is a Catastrophic Meltdown!!! and lots of people will die... but stay calm because we say so, have good evening! and remember no panic!&quot; 
Yup
japan is fucked

@guydecervens It&#39;s also not a tumor, and its never lupus.
And today (14.03.2011) exploded next 3rd reactor , I think that explode all reactor in Fukushima...
ahora si no tengo dudas de que conoceremos a &quot;GODZILA&quot; en la vida real 
@guydecervens You&#39;re right bro it was a nuclear explosion. Around 10 kiltons. The fallout could reach as far as the eastern coast of the united states.
@Doviux09 That was NOT a &#39;hydrogen gass&#39; explosion. I have no idea what it was and I&#39;m not a nuclear technician like you experts here but I can tell you it was NOT Hydrogen.

You should really not disrespect people who give their lives for their country. Anyway, where is the British in trying to help oter countries?
@JCedition1 BUT IM AMERICA MEN HAVE SEX WITH EACH OTHER IN PRISON Y THEY DO THAT?
british maybe u should think before u speak people died in that war ur disrespecting their lived its true america does have one of the strongest militaries
@TheJay9002 Chernobyl 
@justinbieberlovemii BUT WHAT IF YOU HAVE A HART FEALURE?
espero que la esplosion de los reactores no afecte ael pueblo japones los españoles estamos con ese pueblo que ya vivio en sus carnes la bomba atomica
Why do they have 4 nuclear plants on a faultline, Japan has a history of covering up accidents.
@TheQuinch I agree in their being messed up as far as having their financial orders in disarray, for much longer than the current financial malaise the rest of the world is mired in, among other things. However, there is no other nationality in the world that would remain as calm, collected and orderly as the Japanese; no looting, chaos and general disorder you&#39;d see in the rest of the world had it happened elsewhere. 
@ihavtugo TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE ARE SHERNOBIL
@chr0nicForc3 IT WAS A NUCULAR BOMB
JESUS CHRIST ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL THE NEXT NIROSHIMA MILLIONS KILLED HOLY FUCK GOD HELP US
@BlackOpsInsaneClips there&#39;s no point of going through all that effort. its perfectly safe most of the time to be fair. this is about the third time this has happened throughout all the years of nuclear power stations so there failure rate is extremely low.
@BlackOpsInsaneClips 
thtas would be possible 
@artisticsabuko 
No one cares about your Bullshit, How would it feel like to lose your home and belongings, even your family? 
All i see from you is dreadful, retarded lies that you cannot prove. Any who, THIS has nothing to do with the lies you express. 
So why not keep it to yourself, and your stupid Party Beliefs can be &quot;liked&quot; by others to &quot;follow you&quot; somewhere else. You just proved how fucking stupid you are- do you even care whats going on anywhere else &quot;Communist&quot;?
@BritishCommunist1986 
List of things:
1. What does WTC Have to do with this event?
2.What evidence do you have if this video has nothing to do with this?
3.You know how many lives were lost you ignorant fuck?
4.No proof what so ever, Stop spreading stupid conspiracies.
5. AIDS was discovered in 1984, how could America spread something lethal that can be spread through Sexual Intercourse?

6. Do you realize how much pain and suffering Japan is receiving? How many loved ones were lost? STFU ok?
Thumb up, so people will see it

Exloding nuclear reactor explodes in almost same way as overheated steam boiler. Of course there is some radioactive fallout, but it&#39;s nothing compared to an actual nuke.

I suggest visiting Wikipedia, type Nuclear Energy, Atom Bomb, Nuclear Reactor and so on.

Again, thumbs up so people will see it. We must educate society.
@Doviux09 i didnt speak about this reactor but generally
BROWOUT SOON FERROW STARKER
@Ludichetnik OMG... Get ur facts right. It cant explode like a bomb, you need a chain reaction for that. When steam pressure builds up, then it explodes. And here, the hydrogen leakege was ignited, the hydrogen gass exploded, not the reactor, nor the steam pressure was released.
@yeee321 nothing is radiation free
@BarcelPL actually they can but not with such intensity....reactor in chernobyl didnt had so much plutonium as bomb but blast is clear and obvious....capsule with holds radioactive materials cant stand such pressure and it explodes....
@zeronova77 What does that even mean?
@Thremle  Wth is your problem?
Chernobyl won&#39;t be radiation free until the year  22,000 A.D
@foley2222 No . yOU DON&#39;T KNOW A SHIT DUDE ! Your shitty country will be dead prety soon .
@zeronova77 you&#39;re such an inbred.
so if a metldown happens whats the worst thing we could expect?
Remember to ignore the trolls tiring into their negativity only feeds it. Just comment on your feelings of the tragedy and ignore them. My heart is with you japan! Pray for a speedy recovery. And the safety of those still in danger
To All Japanese people, were Malaysian make apologize for making a character of Ultraman running away from Tsunami in the newspaper lately~
We didn&#39;t meant anything, but we will lose the manga episode after this~
Please don&#39;t hate us O&#39; Japanese people, we never make any fun of you all~
It&#39;s our people fault~ 
Japan shoulda checked itself before it wrecked itself
@bahrainTVchannel open up Yahoo! then look just below the search box to donate to them~
i want to help them.....how?
There asking us to send them money for charity i saw one guy on the news he had three planes 2 helicopters 5 cars and half a shopping mall on his front lawn and there asking us for money rich snobs
Just like in Chernobyl where 600,000 army workers cleaned up and built the containment dome after the explosion.  Everything they touched and breathed was radioactive.  I don&#39;t know how many died because of that clean up in the aftermath, but those were brave people.  In this situation, it might take some people to &quot;take one for the team&quot;  to do something extremely brave and deadly to contain those reactors because if that thing meltdown Japan and the whole pacific are screwed literally.   
@ColonPatroll lol 
that made me smile

@BarcelPL   except the radiotion stays for years
@TheQuinch  Life just begins in this short span on earth but beyond this is eternity. So yes he most definitely can help those!!  For those hurting on Youtube it was specifically targeted, Blessings
@foley2222 Dumb people - nuclear reactors CANT blow like nuclear bombs. Get some knowlegde...
The Japanese people like all people are body, mind and spirit. The suffering goes much deeper then physical and emotional distress!!  Religious rituals will not sooth and quiet the tsunami  that rages on in the spirit. God is inviting those that will to enter a relationship with him through Christ Jesus the Great Physician!  Test and see by calling to him and meet the one that can heal deeper then you can imagine!! 
@foley2222 
It&#39;s not going to be like Chernobyl 
@panshit2628 WOW... heartless bitch.. with that pocodot scam shit
@toneo2001 Oh for the love of gog. Does he save those who are crushed under wooden beams? 
Comfort  is available to the Japanese people!!...Psalm 34:17 The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them;
   he delivers them from all their troubles.
18 The LORD is close to the brokenhearted
   and saves those who are crushed in spirit. 
Comfort  is available to the Japanese people!!...Psalm 34:4 I sought the LORD, and he answered me;
   he delivered me from all my fears.
5 Those who look to him are radiant;
   their faces are never covered with shame.
6 This poor man called, and the LORD heard him;
   he saved him out of all his troubles.
7 The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him,
   and he delivers them.
8 Taste and see that the LORD is good;
   blessed is the one who takes refuge in him. 
  

@FanGirlMania They&#39;re not explosions, they were venting excess steam from the makeshift cooling.
=0   =O
@moto1p1 Nah, the Japanese are as messed up as any of us. Still didn&#39;t deserve this, though.
@youtoobization Yeah, those things, uh, couldn&#39;t be related, could they?
Earthquake, Tsunami, and now nuclear plants failure  and it&#39;s only 2011.  I wouln&#39;t want to be anywhere near Japan in 2012.
FUCK YOU WHALE
AND A FUCK YOU DOLPHIN!!!!!!!!
@panshit2628 FUCK OFF, HOW CAN YOU SPAM SUCH A SAD VIDEO?
damn i hope tokyo won&#39;t be affected.. or else byebye animes 
AS IF THE JAPANEESE PEOPLE HADN&#39;T HAD ENOUGH!! They had an eart quake,tsunami and TWO fuckin&#39; nuclear explosions! SEREOUSLY! LEAVE THE POOR PEOPLE ALONE!
I was told in physics today that the uranium or plutonium fuels when the start splitting and things (not exact words :L) they produce a metal called caesium an alkaline metal which Is the 2nd most reactive metal with water and the steam the hot reactor made from heating up the uncycled water had tonnes of energy and made the violent reaction with caesium even more violent and so blowing it up and the reason theres fire is because when caesium reacts with water it makes hydrogen which then set a
@XCHAPYEG and were all going to still be alive... again
@dofke125 hahahaha that&#39;s so true!!!
@markfieldfr wats that
and this is how pokemon will come to existence
@ROlSDUMONDE doubt that they motors that power the pumps are hard wired because of the current that required to run them so there is no way they are incompatable plugs because they are not like your bloody house sockets your the morons who talk a lot of shite and dont know the first thing about 11 stage impellar cartridge pumps i work on them everyday so stop trying to scare people with your jiberish
@ROlSDUMONDE Keep in mind that they just got hit by a ludicrous earthquake and a tsunami as an encore. It&#39;s quite possible that they did have compatible plugs, but were unable to bring them in. In the end, it didn&#39;t really matter quite so much - it was just one in an arsenal of backup plans they had.
the threat of meltdown is pretty clear i am not afraid of the core melting and hitting any water in the area causing a massive explosion and ejection of a lot of radioactive materials 
thats what they feared after chernobyl that the reactor core would melt through the concrete and hit the water below 
they said if it happen half of europe would be wiped out and the other half uninhabitable
ALLAH AKBAR
@masanamasana What... the hell are you talking about? The reactors went into shutdown the moment the earthquake hit. The cooling system held until the backup power generators got knocked out by the tsunami. The mobile backups came within hours, but they had incompatible plugs, so they used cycled water in to keep the reactors from overheating until they cooled off. The whole crisis management went *perfectly*, especially since the earthquake was x5 stronger than what the facility was rated for.
@mrabacusler Because they are.
@califgirl11 why hes right...
@mrabacusler 

euhmmmm earthquake and a tsunami may affect many things ... why blame the people?
Hahahahaha I thought Japanese ppl were smart!!!! Haha
@BritishCommunist1986 
is your caps lock button STUCK???
ive been wondering after looking at ur comments on many vids
Nice.That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been waiting to see.They have been showing it only in the zoomed in version.
Co za asy
Radiation leak?
@Piggieism 
Lol.
Like that ever happened..
@IamChinesePatriot You must be some freak communist shit to speak things like that, get life, don&#39;t spend all of it next to a monitor.
oh it wasn&#39;t too bad....
@BritishCommunist1986 nope, that was all actually done by the British, duh. It&#39;s so obvious. Also, you guys created Al Gore, jerks
@Piggieism Resident Evil?
WATCH MY newest video and With enough views I&#39;ll DONATE Money, HELP ME HELP THEM :)
@BritishCommunist1986 Prove it.
Done.
@Zanethedarkone Yes, it is!... watch Apocalypse Now and read more /b/ ;-)
I thought that a nuclear power plant exploded much stronger
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
@TheJAZZMAN3000 your a sick person for saying that. thats fucked up.
@TheJAZZMAN3000 come on really? You got to be Trollin! 
@NOVCAN
Yes, fission alone is dangerous, and we are only able to use 1% of the fuel. We get immense power from nuclear reactors tho, we can&#39;t shy away just because of a few errors, we need to keep going and learn from our mistakes. In about 20 years we might see hybrid plants, when they get the technicalities figured out, a plant that uses fusion to produce neutrons, that we in turn use to bombard uranium. Fusion produces enough to use 80% of the fuel! And the is no danger of melt down!
@BritishCommunist1986 Your an F***ing idiot!
@00woolley Dude thats not funny
I live in the mountains of solid, stable australia. Like most things in life, I got here by a series of events, out of my control. By happy accident I can sit safely in my lounge room and watch these terrible events occur. If I had been born to Japanese parents, I may well be living their shocking existance. Individually most of us have nothing much to complain about, after seeing these poor devils. I for one am thankful for the existance I am suffering through.
still human and earth suffer from Chernobyl now another nuclear disaster
i think we humans can&#39;t controll that power
Warning! Jesus warns, the biggest one will come over the whole earth is near…(Ex. Before women give birth she feels pain) Which means these things... must come first, then… (Read le399 to understand more…)  Le Nghia, &quot;unworthy servant...&quot; (Luke 17:10) Capuchin Franciscan
are those effin nuclear reactors Made in USA 3 Mile Island???if it is,please recall,like what you made Toyota do to their &quot;defective&quot; cars

60 year Anniversary.
*fart*
Something exploded... Just not the rods... They&#39;ll melt everything at the plant and release radiation =(
what caused the exsplosion ffs!
How would it explode? When theres a neltdown the rods just get so hot they melt the plant... Thus a meltdown. Then we poor concrete and lead to contain the radiation... Poeple are scared of the massive radiation of the meltown not hollywood explotions
@CxerRy96 Sup, u mad? 
@coreymaggette Your a fucking heartless moron. You need a fucking slap! 
@wHisperis001 i watch the news i know but thanks anyway :)
@CxerRy96 It&#39;s not the same as an atomic bomb..... look at Chernobyl, there&#39;s plenty of pictures of the plant after the explosions, it&#39;s not destroyed, just a massive leakage of radiation
@cudmore23 twin tower was work of man...this is nature...so please don&#39;t be an idiot
@ShadowOfLight3000 seriously dude grow up and stop watching cartoons and is that all you can think of?
exactly...if it was the nuclear generator the guy filming this wouldn&#39;t be able to share this...
A lot of idiots here, the &#39;smoke&#39; you&#39;re seeing isn&#39;t a nuclear explosion.. the generators are houses in chambers, too much water vapour from trying to cool the generators too quickly caused the outer casing to explode releasing all the water vapour and dirt/dust from the plant.
Think of all the anime that&#39;s going to be delayed.
@xxkarinaaxx There&#39;s no nuke radiation.. the only people going to be effected by this are the people in the plant working hard to control it.
@cudmore23 haha what do either of those have to do with the &quot;End of the world&quot; It would be scarier if all the major events before add up too, but this is just stupid haha c&#39;mon. 
@cudmore23 
The date of the earth quake was 3/11/11

But suit yourself, If you want to predict the end of the world just by adding 2 arbitrary dates.
does nuke radiation kill people slowly or instantly?
no! :(
i really wish i could be there to help them... sighh :((
twin tower- 9/11/01
japan quake- 3/10/11
equals - 12/21/12 the day w die
@IamChinesePatriot Or just generally the majority of the countries for that matter. No nuclear weapons.
Good thing there gone.
Even the fucking water doesn&#39;t like Communists and gay Anime.
@jleah8 hahahaha
@jleah8 Hahaha nicee
I just came back from Tokyo and the radiation is terrible! terrible!

almost everyone i saw there was yellow!
Keep pressing 1.
@IamChinesePatriot why not..
@IamChinesePatriot Lol, its not their fault that it exploded, think before you post some shit again....
@Adolfo2006651 
the entire world support JAPAN! 
@toddshere 
Nuclear plants need lots of water.
All nuclear plants have to be built close to a source of water (river or sea)
PANDAS!

here come the boom
Meanwhile, most of us would want help if this happened. Forget your war-based  arguments. You&#39;ll never untangle that crap- they just need help. The ones you see running from the waves didn&#39;t shoot at you, and if some 95 year old veteran who followed orders in 1942 is down there drowning, I doubt they now believe the war was a good thing okay? All invading forces, including American, committed war crimes at one time or another. I would want help from that friggin wave.   
@WinstonAdrian you watch way too much tv
support japan!
@jamesjak555 yeah, so people will get their youtube accounts hacked, fuck you, sir. We are not stupid.
@jamesjak555 stop spamming, we know it&#39;s not free and that link gets ur account hacked.
@derfvcx Sadly I believe you are correct. There&#39;s been too many people for a long, long time now....  &quot;Take care of your costs... and your profits will take care of themselves&quot; -- Carnegie. Less demand is what we need, so we don&#39;t have to keep playing catch up and clean up. Nobody likes to hear it but every time they get optimistic and say &quot;we&#39;ll pull together and solve problems&quot; we usually have more problems created by those up-beat &quot;solutions&quot;. Inventions= time, energy, people to make them. 
@jamesjak555 youre an ah
@Neylonx They murdered over 100 MILLION civilians in only ONE war. Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved millions of soldiers/civilians lives on both sides.
@AziaticAmericas Agree, except one factor always has to be included... building our populations. If more people coming into the world once in awhile, great. But it shouldn&#39;t be a GOAL. It&#39;s the one thing that (besides China) nobody seems to think we have to control. We&#39;ve become far too good at more than just surviving. We have far more than food and shelter.. we can&#39;t even tolerate a boo boo without neosporin, yet we slice millions of shark fins for soup. Wish I knew the answer. 
@ColonPatrol 
 U wanna see some fucked up shit? Go to that&#39;s plucked on google
@ColonPatrol if its boring gtfo
no more anime/manga/PS3/cosplay and most importantly JAV for us
oh well, may you be safe always japan
oh god
that idiot TIBOR
@Consp1racyTheorist.. One and the same if practiced by moron&#39;s.
Moron beget Moron. touche, capish, Dummkopf...    
The radiation could leek throughout the world
did remeber the TWIN TOWERS IN PAST ..DUNNO WHY ...but i did get a DEJAVU
that cant be good
Why did this explode? 
And thus the world&#39;s first superhero was created...
Ohh Emmm Geee
@bioshockfan1  you are so stupid! if they blow we are all fucked , is time to stop bullshit stop judging people stop destroying the enviroment , forget about &quot;living easy&quot; and we gotta do something for the world , not for us, we are no more than a bunch of &quot;humans&quot; killing everything for our &quot;lifestyle&quot; thats sucks! as you do.
Smoke wow??
so what does this mean?
Lol now we are gunna get mutated fish with 6 eyes and 4 human legs
@jamesjak555  ya lets all go to your channel you fucking loser!!!
Although a Utopian afterthought, the world should have worked together to find a less dangerous and very efficient energy source (method). I feel this video, with the dependency of fossil fuel today, epitomizes our lack of awareness of the factors limited by these sources. Countries are too prideful to concentrate on the general idea of world unity and collaboration, thus it could be to late for the world to find alternative energy sources.
Lol
is it true that this radiatio can make us ZOMBIES?

w3w!!
I may be an insensitive twat and I know that this is a bad thing but this actualfotage just looked like dust.
; _ ; ...too scary....
@wringerranger i thought it was a hydrogen explosion.
@W00tMUKI that was ukraine
An Earthquake, Tsunami and the fear of a Nuclear meltdown. 

These weren&#39;t God&#39;s choices, these were ours. 
That was about equal to a 2000lb bomb going off. You can see pieces of the structure flying away and dust. That had to be a complete destruction of a building. Have they released what exploded? There&#39;s no way that was a minor explosion. It looks alot like the explosions I seen in Afghan.
Yup were screwed.
i can&#39;t believe the spam -.-
@someone0000000000000 HEY EVERYBODY, LOOK! ... Wait, never mind, it&#39;s just another racist trollfuck on YouTube. Move along, nothing to see here...
@someone0000000000000 This from a fool who proudly screen names himself after his inability to evolve and clean themselves like educated human beings.  Man, there are some who even try to wipe instead of letting it dribble from what you call a brain into your socks.  And you call someone retarded?
@ConquerTHEgreat221 WTF is wrong with you? You need to stick it in a shredder so there is no more of your DNA polluting this planet.
I WANNA STICK MY DICK IN A BIG BOWL OF PUDDUNG!!
@someone0000000000
You&#39;re just mad that what he said was true, kinda fucked up, but it wasn&#39;t smart to do that. Btw America is still a superpower, unlike wherever you are
That&#39;s gonna put the panfish down for a while....
u can see the shockwave
@Lyeaest racist i dont know if ur black or white or wat ever wat if someone come up to u let throw him to the lava so he will be black wat would u feel so fuck u
@iiNsTiNcTzProduction I don&#39;t see the face
@jjkente look up 3 mile island 

its (on a basic view) America&#39;s Chernobyl 
@Exposure232 Then perhaps tomorrow me and a group of people will go to some empty field and kick a rock for 30 minutes in the name of Japan. It&#39;ll show we care.
@LiveL0v3Die in the event that the radiation were to leak from plant due to a melt down then the radiation would get shot up into the atmosphere and eventually circulate around the globe. right now the radiation from the Chernobyl meltdown is in your body. if the radiation does spread there is very little we can do about it :( but on the bright side it won&#39;t affect us for a while and when it does it wont cause us to instantly get cancer or something. stop watching the news and google it
We&#39;re all ganna DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE :P
@Exposure232 I&#39;m taking advantage of the moment? But aren&#39;t you too? This is a perfect opportunity for you to get a moral boost and feel like you&#39;re a good person when in reality (a place you should visit sometime) you haven&#39;t helped at all.
Donating money will be filtered away by the greedy middle men like it always does. Haiti is just as bad as it was. The new world order types run non profit organizations and places to donate your money. Buckle up things are about to get interesting. Watch how they handle the food and water problems, because you may be next.
I don&#39;t get why they use nuclear energy if something happens it&#39;s like building a frikin nuke WTF I don&#39;t get it
@Consp1racyTheorist Dude, I got into the same way of thinking a few years ago and trust me it&#39;s not worth it. It&#39;s easy to believe these theories because there is &quot;proof&quot; and the ideas are intriguing. How many aliens have you seen in your life? Reptilians? Illuminati? UFOs? It&#39;s like a snowball effect, if you believe in one you&#39;ll end up believing another and another until you think the entire world is out to get you and secret organizations are everywhere. Go outside,enjoy your friends/family
@sweetqueenrock The 2004 hurricane season was the deadliest season, and the Indonesian tsunami also happened that year with an estimated 250,000 deaths. Hurricane Katrina happened in 2005. Also in 2005 was Hurricane Wilma. Of course, no one remembers that, they just freak because these recent natural disasters are close to 2012...If our weather truly was changing for the worst, it would be consistent instead of a small window of &quot;worse&quot; disasters ever once in awhile.
Oh Crap this is not good.
You &quot;like&quot; a video when it is relevant and matches the title of the video.  You &#39;dislike&quot; if it&#39;s stupid or someone says something you don&#39;t like.  I don&#39;t like this disaster, but we like the video.
@Exposure232 I&#39;m sure the Japanese families who no longer have a home will be happy to know people sent their prayers in order to rebuild. The fact that it isn&#39;t tangible (therefore useless) is why no one wants prayers.
@Consp1racyTheorist You&#39;re so easily convinced by &quot;interesting ideas&quot;. Let me show you have weak minded you are. Not only do you believe in the moon landing hoax, but you also believe aliens exist, Illuminate world order, planet Nibiru is coming in 2012, reptilian people are out there, ect... Grow some balls kid and perhaps a brain as well.
@hmoshref 
THAT&#39;S RIGHT! 
This is so sad!
Peek at my page my little boy tells people how to DONATE
@Exposure232 lmao, i&#39;m not the one who believes in an ancient and outdated religion that has been disproved countless times, and is still being supported with little to no evidence as factual.
@brunoprela kid this information is way more reliable then other mainstream news. by far...
@Exposure232 yes, because wishing and wanting is what the japanese people really need right now............... idiots
@hmoshref i choose both
Makes me think of Russia...
mot good
Japan: the new Haiti.
I&#39;ve gotta say this is sweet that someone shows the truth, but sad that japan is in chaos.. Why is so many countries falling apart this year!!! This woulda been a great time/interesting for china to take over Taiwan..
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH&quot; -Dom
@TO3A11 and it did: absolutely nothing.
I have japanese friends, and actually donated.
when the shit goes down you better be ready.
@oldcat1959 shutup this was a hydrogen explosion...

Here we go with the 2012 bullshit. People we have had worse earthquakes than this. It&#39;s not the end of the world.
@TO3A11 or how about do something that will actually make a difference, such as donating or volunteering.
God bless PEOPLE OF JAPAN... this morning we prayed and lited candels in our
Serbian Orthodox Churches!
@Brentsey 

dont worry, you wont think its funny when something happens to the US. and you&#39;re about to die and nobody is there to help you. its real funny. 
@nikvin you mean like Sylver Surfer ? =O
@Barnz1980 
Any video yet?
They&#39;ll be like Static shock, or wolverine or Fantastic four. 
THE NO# 3 REACTOR JUST BLEW!!!! not good
Anybody who thinks this has to do with 2012 needs to go back to school to learn some critical thinking.
BURN BABY BURN!!!
Is it normal to be really scared? I don&#39;t wanna die. ): i&#39;m starting to believe 2012&#39;s real.
2012 ppl
@Adirtybird Your post is hilarious.  Why do unwashed conspiracy theorists (they&#39;d have to remove their aluminium foil hats if they stepped in a shower) seem to prey on people on the Internet?  But doesn&#39;t EVERYONE know the Earth is flat, the end of the world is in 2012, and the US is controlled by black Zionist Jews who also appear to be Muslims, and we&#39;re all to blame for the fact the Pluto is extremely cold?
#3 just exploded. Same way as #1.
Some ppl already makin mean  political jokes about! this! I sad!!!
@Adirtybird You can&#39;t argue with people who prefer to wallow in delusion and paranoid fantasy.
@Consp1racyTheorist Oh thats right you&#39;re one of those morons who thinks NASA conned the world into thinking they never went to the moon.... 
42 years later and not one shred of evidence that they faked it, yet total morons like you think they did..  
@Consp1racyTheorist Oh so David Icke clips mean you must subscribe to every conspiracy theory there is.. 
Fuck off read a book and learn something for once. rather than trying to tell all us about some planet that does not exist.. 
Do you think NASA has big curtains up in space to stop us all from seeing this so called planet x ?????   
@iiNsTiNcTzProduction pause at 16 and look to the left on the smoke. u can see a face!
@sweetqueenrock This is exactly what I have been thinking for the past few months.
This is the end. And now runnig on bad situation in other nuclear plants.
These plants are built by Toshiba Corp.
USA lost many lives on 9-11-01. Japan ost even more lives on 3-10-11. Now add those numbers together and you get 12-21-12 Now tell me that&#39;s not creepy
@BritishCommunist1986 hehe to bad british people arent allways like you, ive allways thought your island needed a few new craters, but im a peacfull american and i speak for all my fellow &quot;fat fucks&quot; when i say i hope i dont have to be violent so could you please go fuck yourself? and besides does it really matter what we are fighting for? you forget, we are winning regardless.
2012 is NEAR!!!
Last days, Be prepared.
@Iplayrs8D if you are serious, dont you think they would do more than that and besides we can always teach japan another lesson but hopefully the tsunami teaches them for us.
OK WTF JAPAN DID THIS ON PURPOSE TO GET REVENGE ON THE US. The wind patterns goes strait towards the U.S. Stupid Japan... 
@yeilmon why are you so mad at japanese people?
@beatlesgirl1115 No it is nothing like Chernobyl..
@Consp1racyTheorist I think you may need a new tinfoil hat...
British people OBVIOULSY don&#39;t know what the fuck they&#39;re talking about
OMG I CANT WAIT TO CATCH ALL DEM POKEMAYNZ
@hmarkvitz- power plans were a bad idea and no that person wasn&#39;t being ignorant. They are bad for us and can kill people if something bad happens like what just happens to japan. We could have gotten our power in a different and more safer way. So actually you are being ignorant for pointing out someones opinion
@TheLatestJoke 
I hear what you&#39;re saying. I&#39;m pretty sure it was chaos inside there when they were trying to cool it down. But they couldn&#39;t do it. Everyone makes mistakes I guess... 
people we have to help them........ stop the radiaton and chemicals from going into the air.... tis going directly to the canda usa mexico...... we need to research when it does get here... so we can be ready.
@lemob182 Who exactly fucked up? Mother nature? I&#39;d like to see you contain a nuclear power plant.
They FUCKED up.
EPIC FAIL
Yeah, a GOD hater. Typical. You are a true Moron. Unfortuneately,  GOD loves Morons too.
@iIIegal we are not going to die on that date. Its only a day where there will be a lot of magnectic action. i mean face it, most scientists if not all of them are saying that theres no way that anything will happen. that being said, that addition thing was pretty sick
I&#39;m wondering what this radiation is causing, can someone fill me in with more info?
Dont believe in this 2012 end of the world shite. but if it gonna happen its gonna happen. fuck it just life it up! if we&#39;re gonna die we&#39;re gonna die nothing we can do...
Amazing how composed the Japanese appear to be in this time of disaster.  Compared to them the rest of the world looks like cavemen.  Hopefully we all learn something from this.  
@Ilegal 9-11 wasnt a natural disaster though and ur comment made me poop my pants
@iIIegal congratulations you can add.
Listen mayans didn&#39;t base their predictions on shit, they knew that the sun is eventually going to have to release some gases from deep within it&#39;s core and they predicted when. Also, other natural disasters are happening more often as we get closer to 2012. Can&#39;t you see? Honestly, hasn&#39;t just the weather in general changed a lot? It has. The scientists know more than they would tell us, because we&#39;d only panic. As advanced and smart as humans think they are they&#39;re nothing when it comes to th
@ChiiboxV2 student, why ?
@TheUntamedPube cool story bro 
sure, comments like &quot;Godzilla&quot; or &quot;12/212012&quot; are so much better .


@drevillives2112 pretty fucking simple, we are all going to die on the mayan doomsday...
@iIIegal thank you for the wonderful math problem that you gave us.  so what is your point?  why tell us to add those numbers and not explain your logic behind your post?  
@AndMaida not funny..
the people that design nuclear reactors are stupid, I bet it was Homer Simpson.
On 9-11-01, the US lost many lives. On 3/10/11, Japan lost many, as well. Add those dates together to get 12/21/12.
This is classed as a category 4
Chernobyl was a category 7
@lskandarr you can&#39;t just say that! what proof that every potential and actual American politician in the world is corrupt anyway!? if the American people got more involved in the government and less in the media (the bad ones at least) then maybe we would elect good politician. what do you know about our bad politicians? your not in America, what gave you the right to say every American politician is corrupt and corrupt is just from one point of view, some people just think there doing good.
@Lindy166 I feel sorry for all the ants you step on :( they&#39;re so small and defenceless!
If I was a dick, id say &quot;I hope this happens to you!, its karma yay!&quot; 
@iIIegal thats twisted
@iIIegal it&#39;d be 12/21/4012
On 9-11-01, the US lost many lives. On 3/10/11, Japan lost many, as well. Add those dates together to get 12/21/2012.
we already gave japan 2 nuclear bombs :) 
@daswerck91 they did, dumbass. it was only meant to stand up to a 7.0 quake before this disaster a 7.0 was almost unheard of. the earth quake that hit japan was above an 8, thats the highest recording in history
Muammar Kadaffi has Just been murdered
watch?v=qtnqrE2bIhA

MY CHANNEL !!
@aqinthe i wasn&#39;t referencing your previous conversation, I didn&#39;t see it.
@isoIdier fucking idiot. 
the fuck

can&#39;t they build a protection system for cooling the power plant even if a Tsunami hit it ? 
sounds easy for me, jsut need to make a fucking Bunker or something ... damn, people in charge of nuclear are silly dumbfucks. 
Now enjoy your yellow 3 arms japanes
@noble381297 you already nuked them and killed ten times more people in hiroshima alone than in pearl harbor. what more do you want. 
@noble381297 this is so ignorant it&#39;s unreal
Chernoble again
@Rhythmicons Ya I know. It wasn&#39;t mean to be a literal comment. Have you heard of this new thing called a joke?
@2pure2 These Japan isles have been shocked many time by earthquakes, each time the NNPs have not been destroyed...
I reply about the idea who say &quot;its stupid to build NPP on a land with some earthquakes trouble under&quot;, you could have an EQ in L.A. and a tsunami who travel all the pacific north to hit Japan, doesn&#39;t matter where NPP are builded ;)
Oh my gosh that&#39;s really terrible i really hope they get it under control its so sad poor japan
@aqinthe lol one of those reactors was made by GE hahahaha
Now we just wait for Godzilla
@Rhythmicons yeah after I posted that, that occured to me. I hope they get that fixed, but I sure have a tendancy to not believe ambassadors in crisis situations though becayse you KNOW they don&#39;t really tell the whole story.  

Fukushima.  Well named location.  F U too, Japanese nuclear industry morons.  Thanks for those &quot;foolproof&quot; safety features you &quot;designed&quot;.
we are going to see a film of how someone become super-human after that very same explosion 
For all the morons who think my &quot;made in China&quot; comment was meant to be literal. 
F off 

@PiewHeadshot Hey stupid, do you really think I meant it literally? I don&#39;t know how they would get it there? Maybe in small pieces and then put it together. Do you think they bring a whole bridge in and put it in place or bring it in different pieces. I love how your big problem with my comment was the transportation of the reactor. it was a joke, not a literal comment. Moron!
their power plant they use water to cool it . Welp they def have water now .
@pyr666 

We won&#39;t help in Lybia because the left has spent the last decade demonizing America for our actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, because of this Obama&#39;s hands are tied.

The fact is we do have oil interests in libya, of course why should we help after the way America has been denounced. 

IMO let libya burn along with the rest of these western hating middle east country&#39;s.
@party489 

Enjoy atheist thumping much?
@Lindy166 funny how you rationalise the deaths of 1000s of innocent people by accusing them all of cruelty to whales. Karma may be a bitch but you are a real heartless one. Perhaps if you spent less time believing in your bs god you&#39;d have a little more respect for people. 
@Lindy166 
fuck you and your creatures bitch.
this is about japan right now, not the fucking ocean creatures.
@Lindy166 funny how you rationalise the deaths of 1000s of innocent people by accusing them all of cruelty to whales. Karma may be a bitch but you are a real heartless one. Perhaps if you spent less time believing in your BS god you&#39;d have a little more respect for people. 
@Lindy166 Seeing as you love animals, like I do! hurrah for their loveliness! why dont you think about the Natural damage from this earthquake/tsunami? seeing as you have no sympathy atall or humanity. think of all Wild life that lived in the north now drowned, shed a tear for all life lost, human and creature.

I just found it funny that you ignore the animals that died when you speak so highly of them. Don&#39;t be so narrow minded, Disasters = bad, you = stupid. 
RIP to all life lost!! 
@Lindy166 so thousands, if not millions, of civilians must now pay for the wrong doings of fishermen? yes some japanese are cruel and their history with the US is not great either, but face it--&gt; they&#39;ve donated alot in helping fund for the US in our times of need. They&#39;re people themselves. Its time like these we should see ourselves as one race- the HUMAN race. Under the forces of nature, our bickering and wars prove futile. It is best we offer an extending hand to the Japanese and pray.
everybody was expecting the &quot;boom&quot;
It&#39;s really hard to feel sorry for these Japanese people when they are a cruel, heartless nation that has no respect for any living creatures that GOD created. Remember the Whale Wars? Those poor defenseless endangered whales that have baby whales just like Japanese moms? And here comes the whaling ships ready to harpoon and slaughter the poor whales that are just doing their thing in the ocean. Do I feel sorry for the Japanese? No. Karma is a Bitch!!!
This plans is meltdown,,,really,
@IzzyBunneh  Religious? We don&#39;t have a lot of those. What we do have is people who have met the living God Through Jesus Christ and in  a relationship rather than religion.  You can say we are &quot;post religion&quot; As for Japan, these hurting people are hurting more than physically and mentally, they are hurting spiritually too. Those that go to minister to Japan in Christs name  will bring medicine and supplies but they will also bring a &quot;medicine&quot; that helps heal the deepest part of man.....
@Jochemogool Thank you Captain Obvious!

@g17y5wb It&#39;s funny how you leftists have this  inconsistent attitude about the﻿ government. It reminds me of the way an adolescent sees their parents -- they want mommie and daddie to give them money and things, but they want near-total freedom to do whatever they want, whenever they want. Lefties see the government as &quot;evil&quot; and untrustworthy when they speak of how governments &quot;lie&quot; about nuclear safety, but when it comes to providing money or &quot;things,&quot; the government is THE answer.
SO TRUE!!!
the tsunami must have saved the world from nuclear japan.  i&#39;ve vacationed in japan before, boy they&#39;re freakin&#39; mad about ww2 and for them to have a nuke man, thaz frightening.   they&#39;re worser than north korea.   
there isnt anything wrong with where they build them...its how they are building them.  the reactor core needs to be built so then in the event of this ever happening they can open a hatch or door and flood the area to keep it cool, cant believe it takes someone not too bright to realize that...LOL
WE are &quot;GODZILLA&quot; We&#39;ve created all our horrors ..all our monsters...want to stop them? They feed on money....
@kobhalt94 so it&#39;s the earthquake....  
@manosman97  that not the earthquakes who have destroyed the NPP but the tsunami.

(...) 

Other countries as France built their nuclear power plants in high-risk areas, as in Alsace for example on a tectonic fault.

They need water to cool the condenser and the radioactive material.
Without water, there is heating of the radioactive material, and a risk of fusion of the nucleus . 
At Three Miles Island in U.S.A ., they called it &quot; the China syndrome &quot; because the idea was when case of fusion, the nucleus would join China.

Let us remind that Japan is a set of iles.
That these iles consists of mountains at 90 percent.
That the populations can live for the greater part only on the coast and the plains for the cultures.
Nuclear power plants can be built only on the edge of seas.
They cannot have of hydroelectric dams.
Thus the choice of the nuclear power to produce some electricity.
This country is an enormous consumer of electricity.

@donjuandonjuan so many million years on this planet an we still haven&#39;t found a way to sort out our differences.... May all the nuclear weapons/plants rust in peace (as one of my favourite singers would say!)
@manosman97 
because they need a sustainable power supply?
just because they are prone to earthquakes does not mean they shouldnt have means to power their cities
think for a second
It&#39;s already known that it was a hydrogen explosion. And this can happen again in any reactor&#39;s containment for all reactors with damaged cooling system which is bleeded at the moment.
Dear Natives, it&#39;s time to drink iodized drugs.
@Jochemogool 

we should build them on vulcano&#39;s
This is sad...was this where the 4 workers died or was it another plant explosion?

&quot;Hey man did you know Obama was a muslim? Other guy &quot;Cool where did you found that out?&quot;...&quot;The internet&quot;
@Jochemogool geez dude a lil to soon i live close to that and everyone is extremely nervous about this. Think about it the entire island is near a fault line

Chornobyl #2............... 
@carolb1970 You&#39;re an idiot.
@zaks04 not according to nearly all analysts-just media hype
@FreonRose no because this explosion was not in the core caused by hydrogen gas from a pipe and not a runaway nuclear reaction (as in a nuclear weapon). besides this is minor compared to three mile island let alone chernobyl-nothing to worry about. IMHO this just shows how incredibly safe these plants are because after all it has been subjected to a magnitude 8.9 earthquake. this meltdown we keep hearing of has been averted and was limited to partial meltdown of a single fuel rod. 
@Jochemogool Maybe not... but should be built where they are needed. 

Fukushima....... Who is Shima?
@hyprvypr Calm down dear! People are allowed to worry!! Lol. I think its kinda nice to see ppl joining together and worrying and trying to help. :) Even if it is over something so horrible... :(
@sintetsu Those are Hellfire missiles on the sleigh, not Patriots.  Quit trying to cover up the facts!!
@8SOUNDFX8 Never said you weren&#39;t mate. Just stating what I&#39;m entitled to believe in. Ok? You stick to what you believe and I&#39;ll stick to what I believe in. :)
i don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be the new chernobyl but it&#39;s definitely way worse than three mile island.
All you folks who feel it necessary to post things like &quot;oh, those poor poor people&quot; or &quot;my heart bleeds for these souls&quot; are as useless as those who post racist comments.  What&#39;s needed now is calm, rational, logical action to assist in rescue and recovery.  Sobbing, weeping and expressing your grief to make yourself feel better doesn&#39;t help anyone.
@nismobeach japanese govn. turn off 5 monitoring sensors to iaea. so no other govn actually know what&#39;s going on those 5 nuke powerplants...
@Fluxion77 The media is even more terrified and guilty of sensationalism about nuclear events then the general public is. OMG THREE-MILE ISLAND! HOLY SH*T! WE&#39;RE LIVE ON SCENE AT THIS HORRIFIC DISASTER AND OFFICIALS SAY THE DEATH TOLL MAY REACH 0! OOOOMG!!!

Thanks to &#39;Russia today&#39; for uploading!
@harrymook  there are multiple RCPs (Reactor Coolant Pumps) on stand-by per reactor,with so many redundant systems, there are other systems than PLCs.I don&#39;t know about Japan,but I do know that a very simple mistake can cause a unit to &quot;SCRAM&quot;(shutdown),the scope these plants operate at would boggle your mind,if you leave certain doors open over a short period of time,someone WILL show with an M-4 assault rifle,and you better be able to explain why that door was left open
@sheltv100 Use your brain for a second.  What exactly would CNN gain from lying to you about this event?  Oh, wait.  They&#39;re probably just taking orders from the Illuminati or from the international banking cartels, or maybe the Bushes.
@nismobeach Ummm, yeah.  Because that&#39;s how the U.S. media gets people to watch...by -downplaying- the significance of events.  Are you really that clueless about how things work?
All of you idiots continuing to say this is worse then expected, a horrific catastrophy, etc. etc. etc. - SHUT THE FUCK UP - you don&#39;t have any CLUE what you are talking about. Besides the fact that Japan&#39;s nuclear program is safer then 99% of other nuclear systems, they have ALREADY EVACUATED *and* the nuclear threat itself is also overblown. Do you know how many people died at 3-mile island, including those who died of cancer? ZERO!!! Now STFU and quit worrying and speculating, you fucks.
brutal
This turned out to be 1000 times worse than what they expected. What I got from CNN this morning was a lie when they said it would not be so bad.
@IzzyBunneh  Not S A . Its just  local churches using their own funds..Sorry if I came across harshly, but from what I have experienced and seen its usually the &quot;praying people&quot; who also get there hands dirty by being on the front lines helping... Also prayer is so powerful. I have personally witnessed . I have how prayer has soothed the heart and mind of the tormented, gave  hope to the suicidal,  comforted the grieving, broken the chains of addiction etc. all in Jesus name.  blessings.
@cyber8000  Famine affects 14% of the world population. Thats over 900 million people who have to struggle every day to secure enough food to survive. 10 million dying every year from starvation is not stupid shit, its reality. Look up the statistics, all the information is out there. The world isn&#39;t such a nice place you know, just because you can get food on your table everyday doesn&#39;t mean everyone can.

So is this gonna be like Chernobyl? Someone please tell me!
wow Japan got nuked again!
watch this  sgaS72GRJVQ     somethings wrong
This won&#39;t any worst than 3 miles island, don&#39;t worry guys
all i that i can say... poor japanese :((
i feel sorry for all those who became homeless or even worst... suffered a lost of relative
Japanese nuclear industry have neglected safety at  nuclear power plants concerning Earth quakes. This is the reason safety standard board had resigned in 2006 because safety was being compromised to save money.  
Just more proof that human beings are totally incapable of using nuclear fission safely. 
This is a totally irresponsible industry and no amount of money or &quot;jobs&quot; can change that fact!
please don&#39;t feed trolls.
荒らしは放置しましょう。
@Minuteman9112012 Yeah, whatever shithead, and in case you missed it the other times, fuck off.
You&#39;d think the Japanese were used to getting nuked by now, at least this time they get nuked,  USA will be helping, instead of...well... nuking.....  Good luck Japanians, and don&#39;t forget the sunscreen, SPF 100,000,000 should be enough.
in a pandemic or power outage the worl will fall into chaos in under a week. unmaned nuke plants will blow in 3 days or less. some alot less.
@aveto81 Uh no they don&#39;t! Shut up. hey wait, maybe u deserve it? No-one, not even the most horrible person in the world, deserves this punishment. Not even you.
@8SOUNDFX8 Yeah... Right... What a load of crap
@arcemadnes god? Seems to me if there was a god this wouldnt have happened to them.
@jojoplin2003 Well said :)
@heavenssdin No-one deserves this kind of thing to happen to them! It&#39;s terrible for everyone. :(
Um pavor para aquela gente...sigo preocupado. Aquele povo diz-nos muito, .. Os Portugueses foram o 1º povo ocidental que os japoneses conheceram
wow that is so sad japan is in my prayers my god be with them 
@TheMochaProductions japan anime and manga will survive..and of course the people of japan will also survived 
@comatarmsFTW Yeah i made a typo.
@Minuteman9112012 Yeah, so as I said before, fuck off. Got it now?
@Minuteman9112012 Deleted your post LOL! Figures you can&#39;t handle it when it comes back at you. Now go away little girl , don&#39;t want you to get your panies in a twist.  
@Minuteman9112012 Why? Your just another internet tough guy who dosen&#39;t have the balls to do anything anyways. So fuck off :))
@OakIslandBandit As much as I agree, this is cyber-space. Thats means zero acountability for what they say, so every basement dwelling idiot chimes in with their two cents of moronic drivil. It&#39;d be a WHOLE different story if our tags said &quot;Goofydude (of 123 Everystreet, Sometown, New York) said: &quot;. Yeah, then we&#39;d have a few less morons and internet tough guys. Just my oppinion though.
@firewall705 I&#39;m defending America numbnuts. I live in Oregon. Read before you fucking type.
All you people throwing conspiracy theories around, get a fucking grip.
free this world from Nuclear
fuck japan ! live long U.S !!!  We are the superpower and we remain the superpower... if you fuck with us, chuck norris will fart in your country and make a 8.9mag earthquake
the reactors in question were manufactured by General Electric...
@aqinthe 
And you were probably made in my ass.
@aqinthe it&#39;s a GE general electric reactor
@Rhythmicons It was probably steam.
we are all doomed, time to head for the hills and live off the land
@masanamasana Well i hope this catastrophic failure never happens.
some people will be surely exposed to elevated levels of radiation...
Btw, i doubt we&#39;ll give up nuclear power....Unfortunately, people are more obsessed with power and make money instead of caring about life and future generations. this is a reality that no one can deny.  sad =/
@Rhythmicons , that was the shockwave , it was visible cause of the pressure change . Its the same phenomena that happens when a F16 passes the sound barrier . 
WHat was that blastwave that shot out the top, was that &quot;energy&quot; or what? It didn&#39;t look like the roof because it just dissappeared. It didn&#39;t look like smoke.
EVERY nuclear workers MAIN priority,from top to bottom is to protect the core 
and fuel from terrorist?s,malfunctions and ANY kind of &quot;event&quot;,and I know there were people who stayed doing that,you&#39;ve got to understand,those people have families living just outside of these plants,worldwide.The LAST thing they want to happen is their families to die! Some VERY brave people stayed to save the surrounding areas,all were willing to sacrifice their lives.These people are HEROs!

the unit 1 comprises nuclear fuel bars, a body of water to be steam, a vessel made of a 15cm-thick steel and encloses the bars and water, a water feed port/a steam output port both communicate inside of the vessel, a pressure-proof big containment building which contains the vessel and a diesel which circulates a coolant system.   by the earthquake, the coolant couldnt work.  any of pipes leaks hydrogen in the containment, which causes high pressure and explosion. the vessel is still safe.
Very simple,your car&#39;s water pump goes out,it overheats.Fukushima Unit 1 had a power failure,pump stops.ALL nuclear plants have emergency diesel backup generators,they kick in after power loss.These kicked in..for one hour,they failed because of the Tsunami,not because of reactor design or human error.No water pump,no circulation,no coolant,no coolant,stagnant water heats,boils off,levels drop,fuel is exposed,
@theband2010 HAHA your fine. Any kind of radiation that comes across the pacific will probably be nothing compared to the natural background radiation you would get if you visited eastern washington, which gives off 1,700 millirems a year. I&#39;m sure you will get more rad if you ate a banana for breakfast tomorrow than from japan. Don&#39;t fret. That goes for everyone else on this page. 
i live in washington state and im fucked if the radiation gets really bad and if the reactor doesnt cool down. the raditon will come my way.
@tgmilano doubt that.
@aqinthe   How do you think a Japanese reactor Must be made in China? American&#39;s aircraft carriers also made in  China? what the f**k.....
@aqinthe   How do you think a Japanese reactor Must be made in China? American&#39;s aircraft carriers also made in  China? what the f**k.....
@MrVonKruger People NEED to educate themselves,those who work in the nuclear industry,from floor sweepers to SROs (Senior Reactor Operators) do understand this.If you don&#39;t understand,it&#39;s time now,&quot;holy fuck&quot; is something that those in the industry understand also,to much bullshit  and clutter from those who don&#39;t know gets in the way of those of us who are aware of what the dangers are without having to read,holy fuck over and over,and NO,the reactor was NOT made in China,my God people!
все равно мы вам Курилы не отдадим!!! а людей жалко конечно...
Пиздос , второй Чернобыль, в рот мне ноги если это не так Блядь
@TheIxtlan You sir, Are the greatest troll in history.
@fizzywool you are talking about a pressurized water reactor- the reactor coolant loop is water at high pressure to prevent boiling under high temps. the japanese (and most american commercial) reactors are boiling water- the water boils directly in the reactor and the steam goes to the turbines.  it is supposed to do that.
@redlightdeath i do know the military. i served 8 years on a carrier, including a deployment for operations enduring freedom/iraqi freedom.my husband is on the reagan with over 12 years in. the point i was making is that the reagan was on its way to drop bombs, it&#39;s now dropping food. yes, boots on the ground do humanitarian hearts and minds stuff all the time, but a carrier is a weapon. pure and simple. to see the mission change from kill to help is something that is underappreciated.
@xbountyhunter331975 first off modern seismographs werent invented until 1880. We have record of earth quakes through out history but not how big they really were. Plus you have to think that human population has greatly increased in the past couple hundred years. Which means that more casualties from natural disasters, humans living in places that were uninhabited before and more advance technology and communication to take note of disasters. its not that theres more were taking more notice
@hawaiianluver I actually agree...I&#39;m Dominican-American, but its funny how people decided not to put logics into their comments...Pearl harbor happened like 60 years ago, and got revenged by nuking Hiroshima and Nagasaki...yet people still mock this one country STILL, and don&#39;t even show passion...If you&#39;re like a Gamer of Nintendo or Sony, and wish Japan was gone, you are really unreasonable...Haiti and Dominican Republic had bad conflict back then, DR won. After Haiti&#39;s earthquake, DR helped.
&quot;helping others over killing them. good on us.&quot;

You are an idiot
3 word expression: HOLY-FUCKIN&#39;-SHIT!
i just don&#39;t remember japan having ships in the gulf when new orleans was drowning, and if there were 45 countries helping us.  sorry, im a little tired of us being the good guys and hated so much.  i feel for japan, and that conspiracy  theory called HAARP.
@YourDaddysBelt Not justified?  Sure, it was horrible, both the immediate and long term effects of the bombs.  However, without them, how many MORE lives would have been lost in the assault on Japan itself?  How many more American AND Japanese lives would have been lost in the all out assault on Tokyo?  I would dare say a lot more than have died as a result of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The Japanese would have fought to the last man, woman, and child.  Just as we would have if it were reversed.
@hawaiianluver trololololo....
@hawaiianluver  Shame on you. Because one person made an idiotic statement you are going to rush to judgment for the rest of us Americans? Shame on you sir, keep your hatred and your uneducated, twisted beliefs to yourself. Wishing for plight on a nation is utter evil, go away and do us a favor don&#39;t come to the USA.  
That does not look good.
@hawaiianluver Didn&#39;t hurricane katrina owned new orleans? I laughed epically when that happened.
The reactor must have been made in China.
The big difference in this country is that they are so organized it will be completely rebuild in 2 yrs. The Human Capital Japan has is amazing. 
@hawaiianluver I have a feeling we arel all in for a taste of it!
@junglestreet 

They really have no other choices(on the power plants)
solar panels and wind energy isn&#39;t feasible yet.
@eweneekest 

Name one natural disaster they dont help in?
oh dear! pearl harbor bombing never happened.
@hawaiianluver  were not all that arrogant.  My dad&#39;s sister in law is from Japan and her family lives there.
Damn you can see the Supersonic Shock Wave from the Explosion. That Explosion Was Powerful and high speed.
@hawaiianluver Once again don&#39;t blame the whole country for what a few idiots say. That is just as bad.
@abcedy123456  You mean like southern california? I fully agree.
@aivilik Looking at your profile, you seem to be a intolerant nut case. So you shut the fuck up and get the fuck out of America.
oh shit,thats not good.
Fuck all you people blaming anything but bad luck. and double fuck you people wishing disasters on people
Why would any goverment build a nuclear reactor in such a volatile earthquake zone like that? Thats just asking for trouble.
leave the political crap off the boards and pray for the people of Japan.  (fellow humans on the planet we all share). The only people who deserve bad karma are those heartless enough to troll boards and post crap when so many lives have been lost....anywhere...any time....anyone. Death is not a joke...and we will all face it at some point. 
@hawaiianluver I agreed with your post up until the end. No one deserves this
@trottheblackdog And apparently taking comments about our death wishes like champs. Aren&#39;t we just such pricks?
@hawaiianluver Why are people like you so quick to judge an entire group of people just because of one member&#39;s actions?
@mu17ten Yeah us big assholes and arrogant jerks are sending lots of aid to Japan right now.
@hawaiianluver Hawaii is part of the United States, unfortunately. However, America is also known to have the biggest assholes and arrogant jerks in the world. I wish all of those people would&#39;ve been in that power plant when it exploded and then try to make that kind of comment. :)
Pearl Harbor was a false flag attack so thats bullshit anyway! research it!
i opend all channels only Rt was showing this..cnn was busy making money from its tv commercials and BBC busy with  some stupid show..thanks RT
@eweneekest your comment is kind of ignorant... if you knew anything about the military, you would know we help people wherever we go, even iraq and afghanistan.  we only kill those who take hostile action against us. japan is yet another example of how we want to help everyone.
@miranda75gr If I, remember correctly it was to quickly end the war but the main reason was to stop russia from getting a piece of Mainland Japan.
@IzzyBunneh  Its funny that people quote this useless saying and the say they &quot;give&quot; as to elevate themselves. Having worked in the inner city for the last ten plus year helping the homeless and hurting by collecting and serving food, clothes and the message of hope. I have learned this.... the hands that  I have witnessed  serving, holding and loving the &quot;unlovable&quot; seem to always be the same hands that get &quot;clasped&quot; in prayer.  Just my experience.... many like these are now headed for Japan...
@enjoycpp 
これはNTVの映像です。
All the people from the United States saying &quot;Karma. That&#39;s what you get for bombing Pearl Harbor.&quot;, you guys are so arrogant. How could you have the conscience to say that. First of, you got your revenge with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which were much more disastrous and had insane long-term effects. And now you say this is karma? I hope a natural disasters sweep over your country and all of you idiots feel the pain. Good riddance.
@kickracistarse Trolling a serious video about people in danger.  You take cold and heartless to a whole new level. Usually, I don&#39;t feed trolls but in this case I&#39;ll make an exeption. Also I must ask. How would you feel if you lost your home and maybe even you family in this disaster? I bet you would be crying!
watch this! there is something strage about that   sgaS72GRJVQ
&quot;GOKU return tsunami in japan? OMG !

watch?v=VlvmpX2-zFA

watch?v=VlvmpX2-zFA&quot; 
@erik212 people who don&#39;t understand how a reactor works, much less the problem here, aren&#39;t going to understand you....use smaller words and say &quot;holy fuck!&quot; a few more times to get your point accross, I find that works best here on youtube :))
I now know where the next title in the Stalker series of games is going to be...
May God be with all of you.
i am very suspicious , love and light people we got to get it together 11:11
@Kirawn ,the same reason shawn dawson TV has millions of viewers,because 90%of the people have overdosed on TV,fluoride,processed foods,and chemtrails.most folks are braindead idiots,and its a miricle they can even tie their shoes..
Stay strong people of Japan.
Chernobyl: Part 2: Japan
How do you say chernobyl,in japanese?
@KimmyGarza You started off good there, then you went religious. Not scoring any points with fantasies.
oh, and if there is one light shining for america tonight, it is this: the USS Reagan. Headed for a routine trip to the Arabian Gulf as a scheduled show of force and to participate in the Afghanistan/Iraqi wars, as well as the other events that could take place in the Middle East/North Africa,  they have turned around and are providing assistance for search and rescue in japan. helping others over killing them. good on us.
@MrElephino wow deep. 
youtube.com/watch?v=wCgzfCMzzB4
i just wish people would have a clue about what they freak out about before they started worrying. as for me, i&#39;m going to go put my baby to bed and play some video games, because i am about as worried that this power plant will kill me (or my baby) as i am that martians or zombies might come into my house tonight. good night all. remember: nuclear power is safer, cleaner, and more efficient than coal or oil plants.
@WACBlackout stfu idiot.
there is, effectively, an on/off switch. the trouble comes from the heat that is created after it has been shutdown, that still needs to be cooled to prevent the high temperatures from causing damage to the core. however, that heat would have to be ridiculous to actually cause the damage, and the safety net is so huge that the chance of damage is next to nil. chernobyl did not have the safety systems that modern plants have. 
there is no reason to worry about these plants. there is no significant radiation being released, there is no reason to think this is another chernobyl. the core has not blown up, and there is no meltdown. stop spreading fear and misinformation. as i said before, i have 8 years experience in nuclear power. the people spewing this crap probably don&#39;t even know what &#39;meltdown&#39; actually means.
See nuclear power is clean and good but there is no on/off switch but that is a risk we must take
@kickracistarse Im on the West coast (vancouver, BC) and have my KI pills on route, I hope the core doesn&#39;t blow anymore before the shipment gets here.

God speed.  
when a reactor is critical, it is self-sustaining. nothing to be worried about. people throw around jargon like they know what the heck they&#39;re talking about, but they don&#39;t. there is no issue here, and if you read back a bit, you&#39;ll see exactly why.
@hyprvypr- it is a serious issue, just not how it is being portrayed. it is serious because a lot of people are going to see this as a hit against nuclear power, rather than for (as i see it) and your ranting and qusai-cursing probably didn&#39;t get anyone to really understand why they shouldn&#39;t worry, whereas we&#39;ve been having a level headed discussion here about it. but thanks for your support anyway.
These reactors have gone critical
STFU jackass, this is NOT a serious issue.

Fuckin jackasses, this is NOT a chernobly situation and in all likelihood NO ONE will be killed by this reactor failure. The system is repeatedly backed up with state of the art protection systems. Beyond that, radiation itself isn&#39;t nearly as dangerous as the majority of mook fucking people are afraid of in the first place. Not﻿ a single﻿ person died from the &#39;disastrous&#39; three-mile island incident - so kindly STFU with your worrying
@starionboi, even if that is right, nobody lived in that part of alaska, more than likely, and there was probably no tsunami. the tsunami is what killed so many people, not the earthquake itself.
@nerblebun ;) earthquakes aren&#39;t my forte... but nuclear power is...lol
Bottom line is this- with a tragedy as huge as this (8.9 earthquake, tsunami), the fact that this plant ISN&#39;T in full meltdown (and as i explained before, likely won&#39;t be) is a testament to how safe nuclear power really is. an explosion/fire/whatever, could happen in any power plant. this is not chernobyl. this is not three mile island. 
@eweneekest You&#39;re correct about the richter scale but your math is a bit off. This earthquake is 8,000 times more powerful than the one in New Zealand.
WATCH THIS VIDEO   sgaS72GRJVQ
i think nuclear power is a great alternative to most energy sources. it is remarkably clean and efficient, compared to fossil fuels. it is also very safe, just over-hyped in the media because of chernobyl and three mile island. i did some research into both years ago, and both were operating under odd conditions and had either poor practices or odd coincidences that exacerbated minor problems. with the current oversight, i&#39;d rather have a nuke plant in my backyard than coal or oil.
they say theres fifty nuclear bombs and twenty reactors on the ocean floor
@Brentsey  Umm 8.9 is huge bud.
like i said before, the amount of radiation is likely much smaller than most people realize. it may be 1000x normal, or whatever, but &#39;normal&#39; is almost nonexistent. it would have to be A LOT higher to actually cause damage. i&#39;ve been seeing reports about &#39;raising cancer possibilities&#39; but anything can raise cancer rates. you get more radiation on the beach than in a power plant... and unless there is actual core damage, it&#39;s not likely to be as harmful as what people are screaming about.
you know that the richter scale is exponential, right? that this is the biggest earthquake in japan in recorded history (1800s) and that it was 1000x bigger than the one in new zealand last month?
@eweneekest i sure hope your right
the steam that comes from inside the reactor is considered contaminated, but that&#39;s mostly just safety-speak. the margin of safety on stuff like this borders on ridiculous. the only way it would be dangerous is if there was core damage that caused the release of actual radioactive materials. from the fact that they didn&#39;t go to the extreme measure of seawater right away, i&#39;d say full meltdown is extremely unlikely.
@dakoffran not likely. i worked for 8 years on pressurized water reactors (they are not supposed to boil in the core) but these are boiling water reactors. they are supposed to boil in the core. that&#39;s the whole point- to make steam. there are safeguards to that kind of pressure. more than likely, the blast here was unrelated to the actual reactor, and was something in the building instead. i can&#39;t think of what exactly, but i hesitate to believe it was the reactor itself.
@eweneekest do you think a full meltdown is unlikely??
@eweneekest I like the way you think! We need more level-headed thinking like yours at this time. ...Let&#39;s all just hope your logic is correct.
@japanmeltdown, no i was referring to zach&#39;s comment about seawater causing fallout. if he had a clue about nuclear power, he&#39;d know how absurd that is.
nuclear power plants do not cause nuclear bombs. if the plant &#39;exploded&#39; it wouldn&#39;t be any bigger than a conventional power plant exploding. the issue would be from reactor meltdown (damage to the core) that could cause a spread of contamination. chernobyl was a huge mistake upon mistake upon mistake of undertrained people working on badly designed equipment under poorly executed test conditions. nothing like that is likely to ever happen again.
@zachthedspfan, i&#39;d have to say that you know very little if anything about what you are talking about, and all you are doing is expanding the hype and fear over something that is not as serious as everyone thinks it is. please stop spreading fear.
@eweneekest cant necessarily blame the media for the hysteria because that looks like a huge explosion, to us untrained it looks catastrophic.
Dam japan is so small tht if tha plants really did explode alot of people wuld die b/c tha plants explodin n tha toxic in tha air 0_o
@zachthedspfanthere is supposed to be water, and it is supposed to make steam. that&#39;s how power is generated. the difference is the purity of the water. the salt and other impurities will make the reactor useless until it is severely cleaned. steam is good. as long as it is contained, anyway. 
@japanmeltdown shutdown means that the nuclear reaction is not occurring anymore.
OMG
cracks in the core are bad. always. if they had put seawater in immediately, i&#39;d be a lot more worried. seawater is bad for reactors- once it is inside, the core will likely never be used again. that means they were hoping that they could restart the reactor soon to use for power. therefore, the problem is probably not as severe as the media wants everyone to think it is.
Putting nuclear power stations in earthquake zones is a bad idea.
there is no reason to worry right now. the plants are (from what i hear) shut-down. the released radiation is no more than you would get on the beach in a year. (the sun is the biggest source of radiation, a day or two on the beach is more than i got in 8 years in the nuclear navy)
@japanmeltdown: ever take a glass out of the microwave and put it in the fridge? it breaks. you don&#39;t want to break a reactor like that. dry ice is a bad idea. everything i hear from the news is what i would expect... (8 years experience in nuclear power)
@LesleyHeart1 I&#39;m not one to give into generic pop culture references... but... are you mad bro?...
there is a &quot;fine line&quot; for temperatures in a plant. as long as it is not completely shut-down, cold is bad. extreme cold is bad anyway. ever take a glass out of the microwave and put it in the fridge? it breaks. you don&#39;t want to break a reactor like that. dry ice is a bad idea. everything i hear is expected... (8 years experience in nuclear power)
justa thought, what if the point of the earthquake and tsunami was to destroy this plant

the thing is it seems here was not the earth shaking? why then it exploded?
Its a good time to buy a toyota. Japanese cars are flooding the market.
now compare this to the shitty buildings in china that fall over by them selves
Ooooo.......Awwwwwwwww........... I&#39;m glad I live in the eastern US 30 miles from the nearest nuclear plant and 98% of the time up wind from it.
god help japan in the time of need 
@sgtcadaver1234 well said
An aged Japanese sailor was found floating amongst the debri....all he could mutter was... Godzirra..Godzirra....Godzirra...

Chernobyl part 2 
The Americans had to nuke another city? Even 70 years after ww2.
whatever happen to coincidence! are world is in the crapper because of people not because of scheduling! i can&#39;t fathom the fact that people believe in the 2012 bull! wow!
I&#39;m never trusting nuclear power plants. Nuclear radiation has to always ruin everything. 
That was awsome!!!!! You can see how big the blast was even though it was contained. Nuclear explosion at a nuke plant. Freakn awsome!!!!! 
2012 is coming 
Fukushima - the new name of Chernobyl !
Reading comments from the doomsayers about the radiation coming to the US via the jet stream made me wonder how much the radiation from the 2 nukes we dropped on Japan during the war. I wonder how much was released then versus the possible release from this accident. I think there was less than 100 lbs in those 2 bombs, but I&#39;m not sure, but it was just as likely to come over to the US on the same jet stream, and is still around, diluted throughout the atmosphere.  
@mattl2k6 So you are telling me 10 million people die from starvation each year?
Seems like your full of stupid shit :D
@mattl2k6 So you are telling me 10 million people die from starvation each year?

Seems like your full of stupid shit :D
@kickracistarse wow, thats alot of hate comin ur way through comment replies, well I see most of what youve said is in the idea of trolling, yeah trollings fun but don&#39;t do it on something thats happening as we speak, just not cool. And maybe cos you googled some crap doesnt mean your a nuclear genius or anything, or just that youve had one or 2 science lessons, but please, save it till it&#39;s over at least.
@kickracistarse, you do realize that the US is not an isolated region of land. Other countries and landmasses are affected by nuclear leaks not just where the nukes are aimed at. There&#39;s no telling who will be &quot;attacked&quot; and how far the radiation will spread to.

So before speaking out about how unsafe the states are, brush up on your geography because the nuclear leak has become an international threat.

and no I&#39;m not from the US, I&#39;m Canadian.
@filipinfrancis Thank God I spent hours on that.
i thought japan outlawed nuclear power for this reason or was that another country!any way i hope they get this shit wrapped up!
Imagine this. The engineers who designed that thing were perceptively unaware of a potential natural disaster. Earthquakes and of course tsunamis. Think about it! 


@tomsullivan60 you idiot don&#39;t you know that Godzilla protects Japan its his home, he&#39;s probably going to get how ever started this mess or wondering what woke him up (please don&#39;t flame me for my joke because I know its stupid but a Tsunami in Japan should not be a surprising thing, nor should people start saying that they desperately need help because they are the Tsunami hot spot of the world. if this happened to any other country it would be 10 times worse at least in my opinion but idk)
@b11odik  xD
Chernobyl!
oh my goodness. i just saw godzilla walk out of the ocean. At least this would explain what is going on. I hope he does not destroy japan
@xMendy22 i live in vancouver, but my family and i are traveling to Maui on Monday
@kickracistarse thank god im canadian
What is the real risk of a human getting exposed to radiation?
@pg1171 well they have batteries that are powering these systems and they are getting more to the plant if they keep the flow of these batteries then they should be able to fix the cooling systems. the Japanese aren&#39;t stupid they know what Tsunami is they made the made the word so you&#39;d think they would have there best working on plant and preparing for the worst before even the US media found out about it. I hope they fix the problem because radiation moves a lot nowhere is safe from it.
...and 66 years later, Japan nukes ITSELF!!
fuck you i love America bitches but  yea our votes don&#39;t count and we&#39;re giving away our rights little by little i say lets start a fucking riot !!!!!!!!!
Yea we get it... Its America&#39;s fault that your life sucks. I wish to God our stupid government would stop trying to rescue the rest of the world and let you animals eat each other.
fuck you i love America bitches
where will the nuclear fallout hit?
@kickracistarse aren&#39;t you the clever one? 8.9 richter scale quake, a blast at a nuclear reactor and you&#39;re making clever jokes. Don&#39;t you have any grip on reality at all???
@kickracistarse

You sir, are a sick fuck. Joking about anyones death puts you in the ranks of Westboro Baptist Church members. It&#39;s unfortunate that you are so ignorant of Americans views of things. How about you actually talk to an Oregonian or Washingtonian about how they feel about shit before you condemn them?
@kickracistarse  I wish we could talk in person , I&#39;d teach you to behave like an adult 
@kickracistarse hey:) spread organic heirloom food seed﻿ far﻿ and﻿ wide, its﻿ called&quot;johnny appleseed economics&quot;or&quot;gorrila gardens&quot;,spread more﻿ organic﻿ food. wake up everyone,do your part!

START﻿ NOW!SOLAR ENERGY,HAM﻿ RADIO,WATER! collect the seeds please u all see how high gas is, make sure u can get food if u cant drive ur car or get to work! its scary!﻿ springs commin 
@UberMonsterDude caring little about other countries?

I just..I just..wow

(speechless)
That&#39;s scary shit.
@GivenTime14 many people hate the american government for caring little about other countries and destroying the people that threatened our government interest. but that doesn&#39;t mean that everyone hates Americans anyone who hates Americans for what the CIA did to Guatemala 50 years ago need to grow up and relies that some American&#39;s don&#39;t like their government too. if more Americans were invloved in the politics and voted then we could make our image the way we want it to be. I hope this helps:)
@kickracistarse Chances are if Americans turned into zombies or develop &quot;some gross disgusting deformity&quot; idiots like you would still be trying to hang on our shorthairs Fuck Walmart and Fuck you.
@mojoshow97 
The nuclear reactor has stopped. 
Meltdown is evaded. 
The radiation level of the explosion site fell.
Glad I switched to DirecTV. Now I can watch the world go to Hell in HD. :)
@BlueMastr887 
holy shit its a gay porn phone number too!!!! the end is nigh
@KralTube2 
america got its revenge when it murdered millions in hiroshima, now stop.
@MixedFamily Haha I would expect that kind of answer from a low brain count person. Statistics has no relevancy once a nuke plant explodes the damage is massive. Would you build your home close to a Nuke Plant? Not to mention it puts your country in a precarious position against a terrorist attack. Thts probably why the America&#39;s force Japan into Nuke plants, as a measure  2 make sure they would do as they were told or else. This is not about emotionally believing in stats but pure common sense

Accident conditions inside of the reactor core leads to the production of hydrogen gas.  This hydrogen gas was vented into what is called the secondary containment.  What you are seeing in this video is the explosion of this hydrogen gas.

The secondary containment is constructed of a steal structure and sheet metal panels.  The sheet metal panels were blown off the building in the explosion.

(At the time of this video) The primary containment and the reactor pressure vessel are still intact.
 exploding first machine injects seawater. 
In addition, the breakdown occurs in the pouring water system as for the third machine.
third machine is a possibility of the seawater injection.
@iidaanxX hitler dying wasn&#39;t a tragedy... URGGH  your logic fails
@UberMonsterDude Have to have power for those systems to work. Don&#39;t know for sure if they have power or now, but when you see an explosion at a nuclear power plant, it&#39;s NOT good! Just say a prayer that things are getting better and there isnt another Chernobyl caused by an earthquake!
@TheLeanneching why don&#39;t you just fuck off
0:34

Godzilla...
@daisychix1 Wha?!?!?! The whole worlds fault? Did we make them build nuclear power plants? Did we cause the tsunami? Did we cause the earthquake? NO! DON&#39;T BE STUPID! THESE PEOPLE NEED ASS THE HELP AND SUPPORT THEY CAN GET RIGHT NOW, NOT SOMEONE SPOUTING IDIOTIC DRIVEL ON YOU TUBE!
I&#39;m afraid they are having more problems with this power plant than they are saying in the news. I really hope not though. They are going through enough with the quake and tsunami.
first of all: what happened to Japan and what WILL happen to japan is a HUGE tragedy!!! and NO SINGLE COUNTRY IN THIS WORLD deserves something like this. has anybody even thought about the people who live there? what they LOST??? and if ANYBODY says that this is the revenge for pearl harbor than they basically SUCK!!! because that was in the past and I am sure that not all japanese people support what happend .... so let&#39;s just pray for japan and hope the best!! 
GOKU return tsunami in japan? OMG !

watch?v=VlvmpX2-zFA

watch?v=VlvmpX2-zFA
This is why we cant have nice things... and nuclear power plants
@GivenTime14 

YOU ARE SO FRIGGIN IGNORANT!!!
i cannot even begin to explain how pissed off i am at people like you. this is the whole world&#39;s fault!!
@2deltaactual i think things should get better I heard that the power plant has system that were created in the event that something like this happened so as long as that countermeasure system is intact i think the news (NOT television news) will gradually get better. besides look at all the water they have now (no pun intended) they should be able to keep water running through the reactor until the cooling system is fixed. besides if there was a full blown meltdown we would hear about it right?
That was a MAJOR explosion. The plant is in serious trouble.
lol I love how Japan said &quot;Noo, there was no explosion&quot;
This is going to have terrible after effects.. 
@plstrom thats what I&#39;m trying to say, for a country like japan, windpower could have been great or thinking of a cleaner energy could have been even better, but for now, we have to be smart and think where to put different types of power plants
@ladylari7307 YOUR SORRY EXCUSE FOR BALLS IS THE NEW NAZI GERMANY 
My respects to the engineeres that have to go into that nuclear plant and attempt to get control because they know they are a heart beat away from death,RIP to all the victims of this natural disaster.
@sebamkfan this as nothing to do with the tsunami, this disaster is result purely from the earthquake... but still is very revolting the greed of people. Nuclear power plants are used because it&#39;s cheap and very productive but the risk is soo high (specially in japan) and it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to produce &quot;cleaner&quot; energy...
wow, this can&#39;t be good.
Its quite clear that this is not a nuclear explosion.
please stop making fun of this disaster. it doesn&#39;t show your awesomeness at all. 
@Khultan technically yes, but stuff like this could have happend anyday, and putting a Nuclear Plant near the ocean not a very smart move, near a river could have been better, I mean it sucks if its polluted, but you can block it so it doesn&#39;t pollute anything else
@595o The reactor that exploded at Chernobyl was 1000MWe and the one in the video in Japan is 460MWe. Russian one was dual use for makin&#39; bombs too, and it was super Ruskie in design, so like way complicated to operate, obsolete, not very safe, had oversights in design and required people to yell angrily at it in Russian all the time. They&#39;re both boiling water types, which everyone in the easternlands likes usin&#39;.
I wonder if the radiation will turn people into zombies...
The Japanese earthquake + tsunami killed about 1000 people.

everyday, 30,000 people die of starvation alone.  

Thats the true tragedy  
@Arturo52 yes but when stuff like this happends, it just turns out inconvenient, I mean now the pacific ocean could be flooded with radiation, isn&#39;t that bad?
@jbond193 Your a moron. Even when you look at it from statistics, nuclear power is the safest in the world.  It also has the LEAST impact on the environment.  Don&#39;t believe me look it up!
@sebamkfan  They put it near the ocean because they use the ocean water to cool the reactors.
@sebamkfan   Well, isn&#39;t one of the reason to have the plant near the ocea for emergency to have that water available to cool down the steel rods?   Hey, don&#39;t you know what happened in 1979 in America?  Three mile island, shit, they tried to cover up the incident. 
Dam what if the radiation mixes with the flooded water and goes back into the ocean. oh and BTW no 2012 here folkes
Does anybody know if the entire building of this particular reactor was destroyed? Is the reactor still intact? And what exactly caused the explosion?
