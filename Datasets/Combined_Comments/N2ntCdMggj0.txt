Can we just appreciate the new intro?
But the rvb reference-
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ntCdMggj0&amp;t=232">3:52</a> Is it normal that the light behind Pewds turned by itself?
What if the whiskey parts were edited out too so late people wouldn’t know why the sub is whiskey themed
When trees die, I’m sure they release all the carbon dioxide they’ve ever absorbed. So like replanting is still good but a little less helpful.
I just thought of something.<br>If a toy from Toy Story died the girl wouldn&#39;t know and she would just play with the toys corpse.

Abstaining from alcohol made me a better person. It will make you better too, Felix. Alcohol reduces your immunity, and decreases your capacity for making informed decisions while under it&#39;s influence. You also need to be able to feel good without a crutch

Since pewds and Elon Musk are friends Pewdiepie should get in one of Elons rockets and become the first youtuber to stream from space.
I see though the lies of the jedi!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ntCdMggj0&amp;t=178">2:58</a> Pewds: &quot;The absolute mad lad&quot;<br>Me: &quot;NANI??!!!! DOES HE KNOW NUX TAKU??!!!&quot;
I am confused, I thought Pewds had a pretty bad stint with drinking and wasn&#39;t gonna do it anymore.

Elon Musk is a poster child just like Mark Zuckerberg.  A smart guy that can roll out new tech to the masses with a smiling face and appearance that it&#39;s a super smart idea because its Elons idea.  Its all bullshit like Bill Nye and Neil DeGrasse Tyson.  THEY ARE ALL NOTHING MORE THAN ACTORS

Dude is super wasted.
That&#39;s cool but did you know you can save 15% or more on car insurance with Geico?
Love the new LWIAY intro 🤣🤣🤣 we really missed you Felix ♥️
I&#39;m 10 now
It&#39;s fine pew we are used to clickbait at this point.

Highly recommend you watch Alite then pewds its a great movie. Recently watched it for the first time a month ago and then watched it the next 2 days as well, you could say i got alittle &quot;to into it&quot; i am addicted dont judge me
Why does pewds casually have whiskey on his desk?<br>you good dad?
I love pp review
shave your hair and wear an e girl wig
I&#39;ve never disagreed more with Pewds than when he said put pickle Rick on a rocket. That would be so dissapointing if SpaceX or NASA started taking themselves that unserious. To even suggest that is sad.
i miss the old pewds who did the last of us playthrough :(
Do a PodCast But call it a PewCast
Quick,everybody in the sub Reddit,keep sending him Minecraft dungeons trailers so he plays it
the alita battle angel thing is photoshopped lol
Pewds starts YouTubing in like 2000.<br><br><br>Pewds in 2020, &quot;I&#39;m thinking of my longevity.&quot;
He lost 1 mil subs 😂
Felix you are awesome and you should try bold for a meme
Play mine craft
Who actually presses the dislike button
The Girl in the first post was kinda cute like pls see this and msg me somewhere 🥺🥺 (sekiro_outlawz on insta snap or tiktok :( )
This was made on my birthday
Are we not gonna talk about how Pewds had a bottle of Whiskey in his recording chamber?
Clickbait!
Felix, I think the joke was that one person unsubscribing would make the percentage go down a whole point 😂
I think Alita Battle Angel may have been one of the worst movies I&#39;ve seen in a while. Elon-chan be repping his brand tho
can&#39;t do pickle american warplanes have pickle rockets nowasays
Podcast would be dope
The comments are so unoriginal calling them unoriginal is unoriginal
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ntCdMggj0&amp;t=390">6:30</a> me:☺️ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ntCdMggj0&amp;t=394">6:34</a> me:😐
Why in this does PewDiePie actually look like a evil villain😂
The netherlands
got a pewdiepie g fuel ad on this video
love the New song A Lot
Felix: “ha, even 19 year olds can’t drink whiskey”<br><br>Me: <b>cant laugh because I’m American</b>
He saw a ninjago meme
Pweds: 9 year olds can&#39;t drink<br><br>People in scotland (or the entire uk, I&#39;m not sure): I&#39;ve been legally drinking since I was 5 years old😎
Part of me thinks that pewds is taking 2 days off every week to smash Marzia to make a baby.
I really really loved this lyric...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ntCdMggj0&amp;t=17">0:17</a>
I don&#39;t get the The Netherlands one.. I thought it was about the allround speedskating but that happened after this video was uploaded
we did this to him, we liked the video and he shaved his head
Pewds: Not even 19 year olds drink whiskey<br>The whole comment section: Makes memes about it
shave head
Loved it 10 out of 10
I like Pewds but he really doesn’t seem to appreciate us that much 🤔
2000 swedish crowns are $211 USD
No you’re right Felix, everyone has days off from work. 😄 do as many videos as you want 😁 I’ll watch them
Felix: even 19 year olds can’t drink whiskey.               LAUGS IN BELGIUM
If he doesn’t decide to call it Pewdcast he’s missed a trick.
I REALLY LIKE THE NEW INTRO FOR LWIAY
G E K O L O N I S E E R D

When you talked about doing something like a podcast I thought about the video you made about the break-in and how it kinda seemed like a podcast sort of thing. You should do more videos like that! It&#39;s really interesting and relaxing to listen to
pewdiepie: 9 year olds cant drink<br>danish people: Are you sure about that
do not s h a v e
I hope they cast pewds as the next Spiderman

Pewdiepie probably has enough money to get on the starship honestly
the &quot;pp&quot; sounds like word vagina in the philippines, but because pewds is saying it, its not awkward to say it in front of 19 yr old boys anymore but then it means dick in the other country so

Japan has despised our people for genocide, forced labor, and our country, but does it make sense that the Abe administration doesn&#39;t have an apology? Bushbaby na have to get Dokdo. Dokdo was Korean territory ... And the Japanese don&#39;t know these facts So curse us and our independence fighters in South Korea during Japanese occupation found it, I was the kind assistance of their country north and south.Cracked and a hard time and this is settled with money? As the war broke out, there were many people in North Korea whose families were there.<br>In the Abe administration..

Pew news?<br>PP NEWS!
Now you are back pewd<br>Can you get me a new phone so I can watch your videos on? 😢
I remember the famous scene of Star Wars. After all, Anakin could not beat the teacher. No, after all, he was a little hesitant. In fact, Anakin was stronger. If the master and the disciple fight, the disciple will win. It does not come true for young people. However, if any of the apprentices are cared for or careless, the teacher will not miss that chance. Indeed, in order to be independent from the teacher, the disciple must absolutely defeat the teacher. That is the real repayment. Anakin was sweet. So it fell to the dark side. Thank you very much. God.
Herres for all the Dutch guys
XD My favorite youtuber just spat at me and said &quot;I don&#39;t care what you think&quot; isn&#39;t he like, 30?
damn he was definitely shaking his “phone” gently

Pewds would look like jonny sins if he shaves his head bald
Im tired of this misinformation. Touching your face is a huge vector or water droplets in the air from a sneeze or cough. And a mask will protect from that
