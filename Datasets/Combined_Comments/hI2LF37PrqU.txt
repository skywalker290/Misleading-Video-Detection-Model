Off topic but I always loved how effortlessly Teena caught the scarf.
That duptta scene actually meant &quot;ja behn tera red flag terko mubarak&quot; 😂
I try to forget, but not

The first movie to make me cry
In 2024 I still cry for this scene. I dont know why this is so touching. I was only 5 or 6 years old the first time I saw this scene and I cried at that time. How could I feel the emotion at the very young age? LOL
Srk his eyes . He is a energetic guy
❤❤
This generation never get this type of movie still 😢 seen this movie
Pyar sirf ek baar nahi hota hain anjali❤
Heart Touching Scene ❤️💕🤵🏻👰🏻💕❤️
❤SRK❤😍
Nggak mudah loh melewati hari demi hari untuk menjauh dari orang yg kita cintai, dan memberikan ruang kpd org yg kita cintai utk bersama orang lain. Sangat nggak mudah.
Watching 2024, this scene jst😢
Rahul hi
MissuVikramjikiran
No other movie can never ever hold the emotions of this scene in the whole Bolly industry.<br>Bollywood just peaked here &lt;3
Do pal ka khabo ka karwa 🚉
Aku pun pernah rasa cinta pertama tapi dia memilih wanita lain hingga kini 2kali suda aku kahwin namun nama pilih dia tidak kan sekali
Rahul has FOMO
Bye Rahul next junum milenge😢
I have exactly the same outfit which I wore on the 1st boat party at university 😅😅😅😅❤
I don&#39;t know why people doubt whether Rahul really loved Anjali. This scene says everything to me about his deep feelings for Anjali. Running after train, telling her needs her and he will fail his exams without her, and not being able to look away, even after the train left the platform. He also never forgot about her because her last name was the 1st thing that came to mind when he played Neelam&#39;s game with his daughter and was always practicing basketball. He also had tears in his eyes when he saw her again after several years in 2nd half.   He also didn&#39;t develop romantic feelings for another pretty woman and showed no interest in seeing another woman after Tina died so I don&#39;t think he fell for Anjali because she was more beautiful and attractive in 2nd half. Rahul only realized the extent of his feelings for Anjali after seeing her again in 2nd half.  Srk and Kajol showed their heartbreak perfectly in this scene.

This scene always hold my breath 🫁🫁
Tina could have told Rahul that anjali loves him 😢
I love this movie
The way srk realizes Anjali will never come back and the violin starts is just perfect...no matter whenever I see idk why I cry😢❤<br>This scene is a masterpiece
After watching this movie I became Shahrukh fan.. and trust me I watch this movie in 2010 and after that I watch his all movies.. before that I was always thoght why so many people like him.
This movie outstanding ❤
Recollecting it.........     without notice
SRK deserves to be King of bollywood..

tbis scene is so special for me. I remember, i have already watched the movie for so many times. But once, many mamy years ago, i just sat in front of TV ans started to watch this movie , suddenly when Rahul turned back and said &quot;Shit, Anjali, Anjali, dont leave&#39; , i started ti cry so deeply and so painfully. Which btw, i have never cried for or due to movies. At that momet, i understood that, i have grown up myself and this movie will not be in my childhood any more , but will be my memories , and i will change , as Rahul and Anjali&#39;s lives change suddenly after this train leaves 😢. I don&#39;t know , will anyone understand me or not, all i want to say is that, as she left, the same way, my childhood left and never came back ..

I hate Tina because she knows and she feels from first that anjeli loves rahul but Tina broke their relationship.. how stupid she is
This movie and these 3 actors what bring Bolywood to global stage. As non Indian, I still admired, Shahruk khan, Kajol and Rani Mukherjee untill now.
Evergreen movie superb movie
Ma kolfi Sy boht zeyada payar Karti hu magr usy bol nhi pati hu, or wo kesi or Sy payar Karta a😢
Bro this scene proves that Rahul saw Anjali as his dearest ,closest &amp; best friend. He didn&#39;t see her as his gf or love. He did love her but as a best friend. He loved Tina as a bf. He didn&#39;t ignore Anjali for Tina! He just saw Anjali as his best friend and Tina as his true love. He didn&#39;t even know that Anjali loved him! You can see the pain in his eyes when Anjali was leaving. Anjali didn&#39;t even say correctly where she was going. She stopped contacting with Rahul &amp; Rahul couldn&#39;t find her anymore! After Tina died, Rahul fell in love again but with Anjali! But it&#39;s true that Aman deserved better.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
😢best seen 😭😭
Srk king of falling in love ❤❤❤
Main ladki to nhi hun lekin phir bhi mai anjali ka dukh jerur samjh sekta hun 💔😭
❤
Sometimes what our heart truly wants is in the deep inside of the our heart ,we realise it in critical nd choosable conditions .😢 Life
This  has  nothing  to  do  with  the   horrible  life   Today 😱😱😱
Like Anjali or other girls/boys never fall in love again after having this kinda pain into their heart. Actually I can&#39;t describe Anjali&#39;s pain, but may Allah it never happens with whom, who has a soft heart please 🙏
This scene was so tear-jerking
3.07
srk srk srk srk srk srk die hart fan
Their acting ❤<br><br>.. That&#39;s why they are running nowdays also .. new commers should learn from them
The difference between us is I ignored other for you &amp; you ignored me for others :)
Omg this is very painful! Makes me cry.

When I first watched this scene I cried so hard
Love you so much more than ten thousand helicopter , srk and kajol

Very emotional scene same situation I faced when I realised I love someone but his already in the relationship with another
While watching my parrents😂 why are u crying
I really believe saccha payar hamesa harta hi haii😢
Vaay nə gözəl günlər var idi internet yox idi ama həyatımız gözəl idi😢
I love the way this story is made! Every single scene.. like she threw her dupatta towards Tina which is the only color she has ( rest of her dress is white) like she gave all her color in life (Rahul) to her …literal swag to the film team!!
&quot;Всё в жизни бывает&quot;😊
I love you Kajol ,I miss you.
I really cried in the last scene after see SRK&#39;s eyes😢
Kuch kuch hota hai....tum nahi samjhogi....
And Then Happiness
really sad to watch it.
This was the same year when I introduced one of my female friend to my guy friend, and they both fell for each other, sidelining me totally. I disconnected from both together and realised I lost two best friends at once, I was in huge depression and this was in 1998, when this movie released. So this scene made me cry a lot as identified with Kajol&#39;s character.<br><br>However, as karma would have it, these two so called friends eloped and married, the  poor girl who enticed my rich friend with her sweet talks and looks threw in a divorce case and asked for a hefty alimony in just four months after a court wedding. That is when I realised that God blessed me with sanity by decluttering these people and Karma gave them a lesson.

2005 me bhi wahi feel hua, ab 2023 me bhi fir se🥺emotional😢

Ya Allah lama lama ikhlas gw
Even though SRK is my most favourite actor but I really don&#39;t want him to end with Anjali<br><br><br>In childhood we love Rahul<br>In 20s we understand him 😢<br>It&#39;s better if she choice Aman 🙂
Still now this scene brings tears from my eyes.....😢
❤
Its very hard to बीयर that situaton <br>Losting a freind
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2LF37PrqU&amp;t=187">3:07</a> Those who say SRK can&#39;t act...Just show them this clip and let them know what real acting is.......
अब ऐसी फिल्मे कहा बनती है

This scene is only relatable for those person who only faced it in their life. Yeah, feelings can fade the beauty of friendship.

This scene is well crafted, When Rahul was saying he doesn&#39;t care and all, He thought of he said these She&#39;d stay. But when the train horn was pulled Rahul realised she really is leaving.
रोज़  तो  तुम  हारते  थे  ,  तो  तुम  क्यूँ   जा  र  ई  हो  ?<br>अबे  तो  तुम  उन  स्टूपिड  लड़कियों  के  पीछे  भागना  बंद  करो हाँ  ऐ.... ऐ....ई.....😔

When Anjali throws her red cloth towards Tina.... what&#39;s that mean?

After going anjali rahul was happy with tina.. But anjali she completely changed..
Did she leave her education for a guy/friend like him? Seriously? Nibba Nibbi shit!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
It does not happen exactly in the real world !

My favourite scene 😢
This movie, especially this scene, is very much related to my school life. Miss those days. 😢😢
My favorite movie ❤
So am I
Just look the eyes of srk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2LF37PrqU&amp;t=188">3:08</a>
And the time when Teena realised that Rahul loves Anjali.....so much❤❤<br>Because &quot;pyar ek dosti hai&quot;
Iss film ka best scene <br>Jo dil hilarious deta hai❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Kiya pary ya Mary I don&#39;t  on only ding dong that&#39;s its
This scene clearly explains that we only understand the importance of someone in our life when we are separated from that person but then it is too late.<br>Only only rare the cases  are where we get back the chance or the person again in life which is almost impossible.❤️🥺
I miss you yaar wo time ke liye 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤
In this movie the biggest sacrificer is. Tina but in Real life of srk is man Enocently said many thing in this movie . Which helps our 90s Batch kids on Thier Journey of Life
The best film ever made 😢

😢😢😢😢😢
How perfectly their voice blend
Rahul + tina ++ anjali = Love
LOL her dad’s health is bad and he’s like “who cares, why are going?” 😂😂😂

Kon bhool skta hai ye movie kon .. ye to meri bachpan ki yaadein hai.. yadeein.. L.G ka rangeen tv..kodak camera..polo tshirt ❤️💐
Izin share booss
this movie is Amazing bhai ye tho super movies hai
The absolute look of understanding that passed between Anjali and Tina sends chills down my spine, they were never each other&#39;s enemies and never wished each other ill. Just wrong timing
I am loner with no friends or lover. I can understand the pain of seperation. I cried multiple times to this scene. But no one sees me crying
Miss those watching movies in 📺,,, nostalgia
Jab Dil tuta hai to awaj nhi hoti,
How did two women fall for this jerk. I don&#39;t know!! ( I love SRK but Rahul&#39;s character was a jerk certainly)
Так я плакла😢😢😢😭😭😭💕👌
I faced the same,<br>Love bear all things and sacrifice 😢
🥺🥺🥺
Her eyes : Rahul I am going home, Please stop me, I want to be with you as we used to be..!! Its hard for me to see you with someone else..!! Have a good life Rahul, I will miss you forever..!!

Bhai acting mein koi actor takkar nhi de sakta srk ko❣️❣️❣️🔥
Chod diya use...kyunki main Teena ban na nhi chti thi
reality of man, they usually  fall for woman&#39;s appearance but they get trauma  they suddenly need woman&#39;s who truely understand them.
The day of pathan m watching this scene and cry for his fans today I realised fan k power kya hoti h mohabbat k aage nafrat kbhi nhi Jeet sakti h
2023 love you khan
I hated Tinaaa, I just hated her
❤️☹️
In my childhood I always used to hold my Tears, During this scene. So that i don&#39;t embarass myself infront my Parents. LOL :)
King of Bollywood
This movie sha....my childhood 🇳🇬
Not the best acting, but this is still so romantic 😍
can this scene get any old...
90&#39;s kids please like 💜
Rani mukherjee just 18 yo on this movie.
A very flawed story. The character of Rahul is not even likeable. He was an ass. He went after the chamri and only wanted Anjali later because his wife had died and now Anjali looked more attractive. So Rahul can have whatever he wants when it suits him? Realistically, Anjali should have married long before or at least stay with the other guy. Stupid film, nice songs though.
🖤🙂
Who watching this masterpiece in 2023 january 💗

After this incident I and anjali were met with with husband.......this is happening in only in film only....
I cried like a hell when I watched this movie for the first time
The great scene of Bollywood.
My childhood memories ☺ love 20s bollywood from South india.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😷😷😷😷😷😍😍
What does it signifies when Anjali throws her dupatta ??
He never loved her hmmmm she was only second fiddle
Ох севгини дўстлик деб қабул қилган бечора қалбим, чушинганингда эса кеч бўлди.
childhood memory ...realy emotional
What if Teene didn&#39;t die? Rahul will not even remember Anjali. What if Anjali&#39;s appearance hadn&#39;t change? Rahul will not fell for her!
Decades later and this scene gets me every time I watch it
Stop cutting onions mom please. 😭

No one can compete with shahrukh khan in Bollywood. Excellent emotional expressions he will completely involve into the role and can do any role like Kamal Hassan in South industry.
That scene 🥺

😭😭😭😭😭😭
After 22 years miss you yash
This scene just shows Rahul realising his best friend is leaving him, but I wonder how when Tina and him got married, they never tried to search for Anjali at all? Tina also realises she might be in between Rahul and Anjali but she still chose to marry Rahul and only tried to reunite Anjali and Rahul despite not knowing if Anjali is already taken or not. While Anjali is having trouble forgetting her first love after so many years…. I am sorry I can’t. I just can’t- <br><br>How is this even considered a beautiful story? This whole thing is a mess and I am so bothered with so many things!
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷💝💝💝🌹🌹🌹💪💪💪🆗🆗
Rani ko yakeen ho gya ab
I love you kuch-kuch hota hai 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️
When I see this seen,I can&#39;t control my tears...

This scene never gets old
This gen kids won&#39;t understand the worth of this movie when they are watching and praising movies like student of the year , kalank , Kabir singh etc.... Only 90s kids would understand the value of movies like kkhh ,kabhi kushi kabi gham, kal ho na ho, etc❤
KJo<br> love his movies<br><br>Kuch kuch hota hai<br>Kabhi khushi kabhi gham<br>Kabhi alvida na kehna<br>Kal Ho Na Ho<br>Yeh jawani hai deewani<br>Ae Dil hai mushkil<br><br>❤️
They did Anjali dirty with that ugly wig 😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2LF37PrqU&amp;t=100">1:40</a> All living creatures wants to be remembered. That&#39;s why Anjali threw her signature towards Tina.
Those eyes in tears...  Remainds myself
When his earlier movie Dil To Pagal Hai was released, I was extremely disappointed when his best friend Karishma who&#39;s in love with him leaves and goes away when he falls for Madhuri.  Shahrukh and Karishma looked so good together, did a lot of masti.  She says that she&#39;ll be back, but she doesn&#39;t get his love even when she returns.  <br><br>I had written a letter to Shahrukh telling him how I wished he had fallen in love with Karishma in the end.  Then this movie released with a similar story but different heroines.
Never love a girl again 💔
Jab koe apna chahne wala choed ke jata hai to pura jivan barbad ho jata hai.
Tina&#39;s character is super selfish in this movie. She saw with her own eyes the true love between Rahul and Anjali. She even knew it. Yet as a good friend of Rahul she made no attempts to make Rahul realize where his true love is. Instead she selfishly married Rahul for her own happiness throwing Anjali&#39;s love under the bus. Only at her death bed, she is asking her daughter to do something which ideally she should have done long before.
Kiya chiz hai Sharukh khan

Only who understands bond of friendships can understand this scene, created such a beautiful way !!
Movie is shit but this is a legendary scene
Why does this scene always make me cry even being a boy😥
This scene never gets old. Always get goosebumps and teary eyes. Anjali♥️Rahul
Hollywood-Rose and Jack<br>Bollywood-Kajol and Srk.
One of my favorites movies. When I watched this as an adult made me realize the whole situation was kinda toxic lol
Rahul is a play boy type of a guy who fell for Tina&#39;s appearance. He married her thinking that&#39;s his true love. It&#39;s something happens in common in this world. Two good looking people falling for eachother and getting married right away. Thats the main reason for most of divorce cases nowadays. <br>He was happy with her and had a baby too. But there was only LOVE between them. It was only romance. No FRIENDSHIP no fights no fun just a boring relationship. He thought he took the right decision. But in deep he&#39;s missing his best friend. He was clueless and his feelings for Anjali were vanishing by the time. But it was like a rubber ball under water. His inner feelings for Anjali started showing when they meet at the camp. <br>First I thought Rahul is selfish to get both girls. And felt sorry for Aman. But then I  realized that there&#39;s no reason to hold a relationship when the partner is in love with someone else. <br>Love is blind. 💗
I have seen this movie.. i don&#39;t know like 1000 times... But yesterday I saw this movie after a long time on Netflix I just got emotional to this scene ( I don&#39;t usually cry while watching a movie) but idk what happened yesterday my eyes were red &amp; I was into tears... when Anjali leavs Rahul and he don&#39;t even know why this is happening... I felt that..<br><br>this is year 2022, yet &quot;Kuch kuch hota hai&quot; is my fav movie and it will always be ❤️
SRK ♥
Ys
I were on place of Anjali i would definately  choose  Aman because for me self respect is more important than love anjali was rahul second option after tina

05/07/2022 Still it&#39;s a very imotional Moment Tears come out
What I can understand from this movie is that Rahul really love Anjali , there are many hints like this train scene and Tina&#39;s letter also when Rahul and Anjali meet again in summer camp and when they were playing a game with I love you scene is best example which shows that he love her from beginning
This is my one of the favorite movie

Is this scene possible without kajol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2LF37PrqU&amp;t=189">3:09</a> This is the moment Rahul suffered his very first heartbreak!
Facts =You will watch/remember and watch this scene and cry but it&#39;s too late. You feel the value only after you lose him/her.
Tina had realized that Anjali loved Rahul right then and there, but she was in a quandary. if she rejects Rahul then rahul will be heartbroken, but if tina tells rahul that anjali likes her then it will bring down Anjali&#39;s self-esteem as a woman. meanwhile tina herself may still love rahul but in different feelings before knowing this fact
Tina looks after and keeps the red sari so that her child can take care of it, it&#39;s really amazing
🖤👌💙💚💛🧡🥰😍🤩👍😘😘✌
Mene jindagi me  Amitabh Bachchan ko &quot;manjile apni jagah he raste apani jagah&quot; song pe originally hard touching  imotional  expression dekhe the or ek bar fir is film me Shahrukh khan ko.<br>Verry genius.
Flim indrustry me ye pal hamesa yad rahegi...

Childhood memories 🥺😔❤️
I am really very obsessed with angli&#39;s character in this film...i wish if karan johar make part 2 of the same movie then i want him to make 2 hero&#39;s and one heroine just like in this movie there were two girls....and i want him to cast me as on of the two male actors😊❤️
This masterpiece never forget everyone watching movie
The films of these two kings will remain in my heart forever❤
Vry emotional 😭😭 swsame 👍👍
It&#39;s 2022 and these moments are immortal 🔥❤️
Watching it again on 18th April 2022<br>Masterpiece movie😭😭😭
Iam crying after watching tis scene😭😭😭😭😭😭😭anybody here to wipe my tears😭
There&#39;s a deleted scene where Karan wanted to start the movie with Tina in an emotional state at her wedding. She was aware that she had little time left. And remember the scene on Friendships Day where Mr. Malhotra explains to Anjali that his wife passed away a long time ago, it makes sense that Tina could&#39;ve inherited a genetic trait from her mom that puts a lot of strain on her during a pregnancy. So Tina knew she wasn&#39;t going to be alive to care for her daughter. Other producers decided against the scene that&#39;s why it was cut.

Just for a man, she didnt complete her college degree. She wasted her parents money just for a man. Lol

<b>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</b> :- Kajol Diserved ShahRukh but he went for Rani Mukharjee.<br><br><b>Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gum</b> :- Rani Mukharjee deserved ShahRukh but he went for Kajol.
Sedihnya saat Anjeli mencampakkan hijab nya.....
Sedihnya Anjeli......harus pisah sama seorang sahabat kecilnya......
Sometimes I feel Shahrukh is selfish, he wants both kajal and raani, i loved Kajol&#39;s role, many scenes of Kajol made me cry
My heart is broken 😭😭💔🤧😭😭💔

Even after 20 year&#39;s,this scene still bring tears into my eyes 😢
I&#39;m crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭<br>I&#39;m crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭<br>I&#39;m crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Tina knew they loved each other but were too honorable to hurt her yet she deliberately kept them apart which in my opinion is selfish and inhuman....Tina knew Rahul never really loved but still chose to punish all of them and making everyone miserable.
Heart touching
I cant count how many time i watched this movie years ago..and stil i loved it though it s been yearssss ...
23 years ago but 😥
2022kon hai?this story was amazing
Even after 23 years,this scene still bring tears into my eyes

💓💓 it&#39;s give me great imotion to watching this seen 💓💓💓
Still in 2022 is hearts touching 💓💓💓
Really heart touching seen  💓💓💓
One of the thing i got to understand from this Movie is that... Rahul only started loving the girl when she is too hot or beautiful like Tina or Anjali in second phase or when they started leaving him ... And that&#39;s the Nature of Every Men and Boy!!!!.....
&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2LF37PrqU&amp;t=77">1:17</a>&quot; Am I the only one whose eyes are teary after listening to this BGM? 😢
Crying 😭
Yeh scene meri life me real me ho gya  i can relate how much it hurts
Ye hoti thi filme ❤️

2022 😭 the Epic Scene 🔥✌️
&quot;Love doesn&#39;t claim possession, but it gives freedom.&quot;<br>Rabindranath Tagore<br><br>Here Anjali doesn&#39;t claim possession of Rahul rather leaves him at Tina&#39;s disposable. Love demands sacrifice, Anjali does that, she is the genuine lover. So at the end she smiles.
I hv seen this movie n number of times
Kajol and shah rukh❤️❤️❤️

Wow this movie have a lot of memories for me
Who is still getting emotional by this scene in 2022 ???
😢
??
WOW NICE MOBIE
But i don&#39;t like the end. Kajol shouldn&#39;t marry srk as he got feelings for her by seeing her beauty that&#39;s too after Tina&#39;s death.. Whether tina alive he can&#39;t and won&#39;t marry Anjali
Hijab Kajol itu untuk Tina Rani......
Hijab Kajol itu untuk Tina Rani......
Hijab Kajol itu untuk Tina Rani.......
Hijab itu punya Rani.......<br>Hijab itu punya Rani......<br>Hijab itu punya Rani......
Cerita singkat nya......<br>Kajol mencampakkan hijab garis garis tiramissu Tina.......
Sedih nya cerita Sharukh Khan ini......<br>Antara Tina dan Kajol tak habis habis........<br>Akhirnya si Kajol mencampakkan hijab garis garis Tina.........
Di indonesia Anjeli tetap pakai hijab hijab Kajol..........
Kalau di indonesia.....<br>Kajol itu tetap sama aman........<br>Rahul tetap sama Rani.........
You can see the whole emotion in this scene check it guys  1.25min you will get a spark in this scene for sure,,, ooh my god srk n kajol🥳🥳💙💙💙💙💙

Anjali&#39;s dress is same as like my college 😂 wahi kahani chal raha 😭kuch kuch hota hai 😥
this scene never ever fails to bring tears in my eyes :)<br>can just never be over of the goosebumps that this film gives me everytime i watch it. FAV FOR A REASON ♥️
Still with tears in my eyes
🥺🥺🥺
🥺
The real love 🥰
😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but FRIENDS are for life!!<br>-Phoebe
That &#39;shit&#39; from SRK when he realises this is really happening
The most painful scene...even after all those years I am yet to come upon another heart breaking scene like thus one. I could feel all that needed to be said between the 3 of them. Anjali knowing that she has to go away so that she hides her feelings and avoid heartbreak, Teena knowing why Anjali is leaving but she can&#39;t do anything for her friend, Rahul finally coming to an awakening of the deep connection he and Anjali share. <br>This is the best movie in its genre and given the standards of those days, I&#39;ve ever seen. <br>It has everything.
I cries like a baby during this scene😢😢😥
Just Love 💓💓💓
Now a days i am in this situtaion😥😥😥really pain apna love apna bestfrnd kisi ko dena bht mushkil hogya ha bht 😥😥😥
Please Subtitles.
Amazing 👍👍👍😘

কি কারনে ওড়না ছুড়ে ফেলে এইভাবে চলে যাচ্ছে কিছুই বুঝলাম না Really so bad স্টেশনের ৭০% লোক শুধু তাকিয়ে থাকতে পছন্দ ও ভালোবাসে।বিশ্বাস না হলে রেল স্টেশন বা বাস স্টেশনে গেলে দেখবেন😳🧐
Sonny tsanglao. If you are reading this. I have loved you and take my love for you till my grave. I may be bad but I truly loved you. You know it. Pyar is not always about staying together.
Pardon faîtes quelques choses
Pourquoi il y&#39;a pas les films indiens en version française😭😭
I am crying while watching this scene🥺🥺
बँबई माफिया का सारा पैसा,  पाकिस्तान के नियंत्रण मे जाता है .....फिर, सितारों (Hero/Heroin) के भेष मे छिपे जिहादीयोँ को पहुँचता है...जो हिन्दूस्तानी भावनाओं को फिल्मों मे डालकर,  जिहाद का जहर पूरी दुनिया मे बाँटते हैँ।

Agar tina nahin marti to rahul ko anjali se pyaar hi nahin hota. This is called true love?
Kya moment tha
We all know Tina was selfish in this movie  that&#39;s why she get the reward of death at the end 🙄😭😭😭
Chup rh pana,sob ki baas me nhi hota...🌧️🌧️
Rona ata ha bhot 😥😢😢😭
Kajol is best actress in Bollywood
2021 still watching 🇵🇭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2LF37PrqU&amp;t=90">1:30</a> rani caught the love in anjali&#39;s eyes but Rahul can&#39;t😑😥
Just bcoz anjali use to dress up like tom boys rahul didnot have feelings for her. Suddenly when he sees her in feminine get up(saree+long hair) his affection for her arises. What a shit. I feel sorry for anjali. She should have chosen aman. She deserved a person who loves her for who she is.
nothing is more important than self respect to me,,I
I watched this movie in 2016. It&#39;s been my favorite Bollywood movie since.
This secen is very emotional my favourite film
Yar ye Pyar be bas chiz hai
আমি খুব কেঁদেছি
💙💙
Every time I see this my heart melts <br>what a great movie <br>Everyone knows what a one side love means ❤️<br>That pain you have to hold in your hearts regardless others know it or not <br>This scene resembles that
Kisi ki khusi ke lie bhut kuch chodna pdta hai kya ehi pyar ka mtlb hai
que pena que Anjhali se fue
Bollywood ne 1980s kids ko pura bigaad dia hai… actually this is a super stupid movie…
50 Years later;<br>My son :- “Dad who was Shah Rukh Khan?&quot;<br>Me :- “Sit son, I have a story to tell you&quot;..
<b>This was undoubtedly the most painful scene of their untold story.</b> The way he wants to hold her tight, don&#39;t want to let her go but he&#39;s still letting her go because he doesn&#39;t seem to have many reasons to keep her by his side. <br><br>The way Anjali knows how much she loves him, but he&#39;ll never see her with those love eyes like he sees Teena, the way he claimed he loved Teena when she was about to confess, and the way their friendship took a big turn and ended with just small words of how they&#39;ll miss each other, never knowing when they&#39;ll meet again, it&#39;s all hidden in their actions how much they care for each other.<br><br>Yet Rahul doesn&#39;t love her. And she knows that. And she wants to forget him now. Of course, she never does that because it&#39;s hard to do that. Because he was her first love. Much much harder than anything ever. It&#39;s toxic and exhausting but its addicting at the same time. <br><br>What makes this scene harder to watch is that they really didn&#39;t meet each other for at least half a decade because at that time, there really wasn&#39;t much ways of communication as there are now. Only a person&#39;s viable phone number  or a present address was all that a person could obtain in those days. <br><br>So when Anjali said she was going, she really was going. Forever. Leaving him. That&#39;s what she decided. <br><br>I still can&#39;t say whether I totally agree with how Rahul falls in love with her later, or how some people claim he&#39;s already in love with her. &#39;Cause Rahul was so carefree, careless, impulsive for the most of the guys of his age. So can&#39;t really say what changed for him. <br><br>But the role of Anjali always pricks thorns at my heart, it&#39;s so real, so alive, raw and breathing (Kudos to Kajol Mam) that one can really relate easily to her on so many levels. <br><br>To those who think that &quot;if you love a guy and he doesn&#39;t give you the same attention that you want from him so later when he comes to beg you to take him, you&#39;ll rather marry someone else&quot;<br><br>First, it wasn&#39;t his fault that he didn&#39;t see you the way you saw him, at first, (believe me when I say I have a severely broken heart on this matter)but now that he sees you (never happened with me), atleast give him a chance. If you claimed you loved him, you should learn how to forgive too.<br><br>I don&#39;t care how short, transient and baseless relationships are now at this age and era, but if yours is a true love, you shall never be able to forget him. Even if you move on from him, be with someone else, you&#39;ll still feel regret and sense of loss of your other half. It happens and it&#39;ll keep happening anyway. That&#39;s what true love revolves in your heart. <br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kkhh">#kkhh</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2LF37PrqU&amp;t=90">1:30</a> You don’t need words to explain how Tina realised at that moment that she had come between Rahul and Anjali.
