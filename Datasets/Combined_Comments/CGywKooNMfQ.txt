School of fish stupid
Its a portal to another dimension.
Or seaweed
Looks like a blanket to me
A giant harlem trout , It left because it didn&#39;t  like all the piss in the water  from all those people...
Could be a sting ray.....probably is a sting ray....notice how it swam away when the people started touching it? A school of fish wouldn&#39;t have swam that close to the shore ...let alone to humans...a sting ray might have...and there was a second smaller,but still large one off to the right. My guess is the guy filming was just lazy.
Send it to billschannel
Dont worry. Its just a bird&#39;s shade falling on water.
es la sombra de una nube pendejos ilusos.

that&#39;s was a group of small fish
it&#39;s some kind of intergalactic space robo-marital aid from alpha centari, sent to give ancient aliens another season of bull shit...
It&#39;s most likely a big school of fish. They swarm together to make themselves seem like a single big fish and deter predators. Like the fish in Finding Nemo that formed into various shapes, or like  Wishiwashi and it&#39;s Schooling ability from Pokemon Sun and Moon.<br>It could also be a large clump of seaweed being brought in my the tide, but I doubt that would gain so much interest.
It appears to be a manta ray
its a small fish
No I think the people are pulling a net.
Something that can be seen from far ...........................
probably from the blue sea
Sting ray üò¶
isso e o que
For those of you saying it&#39;s a giant sting ray. It&#39;s called a manta ray and they don&#39;t sting.  Harmless and  very beautiful peaceful creatures look up manta rays. or its a school of small fish
Well, I guess if it was something scary or harmful, the people would have ran out of the water? I wish the camera person would have gotten closer!!! Might have been a large school of fish.
fkee
My guess is a baitball. many thousands of small fish,  schooling, to avoid predatory animals
hmm what is that
ITS A Shadow or something

It&#39;s a school of fish

They are school of small fish that is why the shape of blue color change.
people wouldn&#39;t be standing near a giant sting ray, idont think I would want to be near one bc of its tail
but their is people in the water
Manta rays are the largest rays and are known to be very docile. They can reach 7 meters (23 ft). That&#39;s the first thought that I had, especially because it&#39;s slower moving and doesn&#39;t seem to mind all the people around it.
oil
sting ray or oil from a boat
inflated hot air balloon

I think it&#39;s a sting ray
its a Pussy fish
You&#39;re all crazy. Does no one seem to think it is a cloud shadow? They can be in any shape. They move, they dissipate and they change. If it were sardine and someone dives at them, they would scatter; if it were a stingray many would keep clear, plus stingrays do not swim near humans; if it were a cloud of plankton they would separate if someone dived there. My instant feeling was a cloud shadow.
it&#39;s just a big ray-fish
it&#39;s GODZILLA   RUN
üôàüôâüôä
idk what is that creature but I don&#39;t believe it, so I don&#39;t want to watch it agajn

This is chupacabra!
dorry guys it was my mistake ,i shouldn&#39;t masturbate under the water
The lack of panic from those in the water leads me to believe this is fake
ohh i was there and .. it was not a sea creature ...!! duh .. and if it was a sea creature then we all would have freaked out !!!! ohhhhhh
What is that kind of sea creature?
So the only fucking person with a camera decided to stand 100 yards away WHILE others were rushing the shape and practically on top of it? Get real. The camera person wouldn&#39;t be that far away. It&#39;s a school of fish or a long cloth. Similar to the ones used on long dinner tables. I&#39;m not buying this BS of how EVERY time a ghost or creature or UFO is &quot;caught&quot; on tape it is always too blurry, too far, too high, too dark, get real!

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a school of fishes, maybe a manta ray of sting ray, no screaming or running so its either that it&#39;s nothing to worry about r it IS something to worry about and I those ppl are so dum or badass that they don&#39;t get out of the water. Anyways it isn&#39;t a school of fish cos some fish will fall behind,there aren&#39;t any stragglers in this vid,so ray or jelly fish
What is going on I don&#39;t get it at allüò™

skool of fishes
A lot of times schools of fish will rush toward the shore to get away from something.  They&#39;ll run right into the people lol.  I grew up on the gulf coast. This type of thing is common.  And the no screaming and running kinda lets you know it&#39;s innocuous.  
Just a 25 foot long eel
Its kyogre
Pokemon are real?????<br>Yay no its a squid
Its a wave! 
Looks like a fishing net to me. Maybe something is caught in it?

I wonder if it was a fish that ate to many tacos and burritos

It&#39;s a school of small fish.
It could&#39;ve been a huge black blanket, no?
Everybody gets closer to the, what ever it is, yet the filmer stays on the same spot all the while and expects us to believe it&#39;s something strange. üòï
I&#39;d call this a sea carpet
Its probably just a manta ray, the biggest ones can have a wing span like single prop plan.
Looks like a giant ray....
Coop

shoal of small fish
Nobody is afraid of it?!! And it changes shape. So must be school of fish. People run toward it not away!!

Of course its a school of fish, but with 13 million views its good advertising for the lottery.

a shadow of a big kite or a parachute
noob
screw the sea creature, what about all the hot chicks running on the beach!

Somebody have accident, that all.
It could also just be an over sized stingray. Stingray have been known to swim around people. You just have to be carfull when your doing it. And these people are being carfull<br>
Wow! How amazing!
Wow 
i think its just some little fishes that ¬†swim close together ¬†
This is fake it&#39;s just a big school of fish notice how nobody tries to get out of the water lol
It could of been a  shadow of  a kite 
Not a stingray... not a single creature... It&#39;s a school of fish.<br>You see it change shape half way through.
Its a school of fish ....

A beach blanket or a manta ray
School Fishes!
forse brachi di placton o avanotti

That was a clump of seaweed at the bottom of a shallow ocean with clear water.
Which one male or female bro???
People aren&#39;t running scared from it because they know it&#39;s just a school of sardines, which are very common in that part of the world.
????????????????????
It&#39;s just a school of fish
it is call fish if you never heard of it¬†

cat fish
its a sting/manta ray ._.
Its just seaweed.
millones de pececitos¬†
I don&#39;t think its digitally manipulated because people seem to be running towards it to see what it is. And the people near it aren&#39;t moving away from it because they are close enough to see that its not scary, like a school of fish most likely...
it&#39;s a shoal of fish that losing the navigated
les grose coneris mons gars cest du bleufe

I cant be a school of fish
What is it<br>
It can&#39;t be a kite
I think its an alien from pluto
I&#39;m inclined to think it was a large Manta ray. The like contact with people. Most of the time , not always. And before anyone mentions the sadly missed Steve Urwin, that was accidental. The ray didn&#39;t attack him.
¬†No way it&#39;s ¬†Godzilla
If it was a real strange creature the guy with the camera would have gotten closer to show a better look .
And the fuckin human race won again!!
like to see the man try to jump into the shadow hihi
Its a pool of godzilla urine

HEY EVERYONE LETS ALL SWIM TOWARDS THIS LARGE BLACK SHAPE IN THE WATER
√∂lfleck oder plane!kein tier! ;)
What is it
It&#39;s a shoal of fish. Amazed those people stayed in the water as there are great whites in the Med.....
was that an oar fish or just sardines? if so, then i want some of them sardines.
Ribbon worm
Schools of fish, nothing more, nothing less.
It is nothing a fake more then likely ...Come on the people would be freaking out
school of fish
it was actually a group of sardines. they swim in massive groups. they are not harmful at all. they do not like being touched so they clear way for¬†objects but they eventually completely surround the¬†object without even touching them no matter which direction the person moves
Guys I think it&#39;s a very large manta ray coming in to shore in search of food, and happened to do so at that beach. Although it is just a blob not a ray shape. Really, I could believe ¬†either answer.
fish band
That is bunch of fish
NO MORE THAN A BABY SPERM WHALE...
school of fishes.
C&#39;mon guys it&#39;s a kraken calm down
Either just seaweed or a school of fish, we&#39;re not stupid
Every one stays in the water close to it so it was nothing.
Probably just a bunch of fish. No splashing on the surface even though It was super shallow. And all the people near by weren&#39;t shitting brick and hauling ass outta the water
Or monster
A big ass sea worm
You all should have ran
Could be a school of small fish, it looks similar to a flock of birds.
Im sure this is some cloth left  by someone and all this is fake...

My wife, who has never left Maine in her life and never even seen tropical water guessed &quot;small school of fish on her second guess. Come on people. Lol
Hasn&#39;t anyone seen a large school of really small fish? This is why the swimmers didn&#39;t freak out guys. I have seen this up close and personal. That&#39;s just a bunch of really little fish. Nothing scary. :)
its a school of fish. is all.¬†
It&#39;s a parachute Dumass
It&#39;s clearly a shoal of bait fish. The shoal above is being attacked by predators, you can see the splashes of evading prey. Bait fish will hug the shore as a defensive posture, similar to armies using the landscape to avoid being outflanked.
Its just a stingray!
shoal of fish.... you guys need to got out more often....
its a bunch of fish
Probably a type of ray...or aa grouping of small fish?
maybe a big stingray?
Run away - it&#39;s a hnakra!!!
it looks like a giant stingray by the way its moving
If it had been really interesting surely the person with the camera would have walked over to it rather than standing still.¬†
And no one even cares to try looking under water at it really
Those people aren&#39;t scared so it&#39;s someone in a costume
What is that kind of  that sea creature<br>
Oarfish.
It was a school of fish. Look at how it changes shape
Its sharkpedo...pokemon
geeez it&#39;s just a school of bait fish.
School of fish
MA E SOLO UNO SCIAME ¬†DI SARDINE!!!!!
With a manta ray that size, I&#39;m pretty sure no one of those people would have gone that close!!
I saw 3 during that vid. There was one near the rocks...
Manta ray don&#39;t you think 
Its Lagaricus.<br>
ok..............
un ban de poisson certainement
I think its a kite from above
&quot;Brody it&#39;s just blue fish!!&quot;
Whut is that
Its fish -_-
Looks like a giant stingray
A tarp. Definitely not a group of fish because it would move in different directions

The bathers don&#39;t seem worried. They would be in a panic had it really been a.strange creature. 
it is a manta ray
school of fish
jesus that&#39;s a big lilo
It&#39;s a shadow from something in the air.
I can&#39;t believe a bait ball got over 12 million hits. You think word might get around.
Group of some fish
HEY GUYS! BYE GUYS!
Its just a long piece of cloth<br>Idiots these days. (:l)
do to the small freckles on the &quot;sea creature&quot; it is just a confused school of fish
I believe this is &quot;Sulur Bidar&quot;. It&#39;s a mystic creature lives in water. Old folks says that Sulur Bidar is like a carpet in the water. Fishermen often sees them whether in the sea or river or mines
shadow of an airbloon
Giant piece of cloth
tarp fish
Giant piece of seaweed?
Probably that is only people shit<br>Hahaha eat that shit..people =shit hahaha

if that was like a sea creature then if it got to the shallow then it would surface
A school of fish trying to get away from other big fish, wish i was there to have seen them :-)

Thats a group of little fishes
Group of little fishes
Ir a a blanket

Anyone ever hear of a bait ball?! Lol really tho it&#39;s a fucking ball of baitfish
the real answer is its a school of small fish idc if u do not believe this answer im telling u 100% truth.
I&#39;m guessing the guy videoing it was wheelchair bound then...........?
WOW!!!
It&#39;s called a school of fish
could&#39;ve been a school of fish¬†
the black thing is moving with the wind (i.e., an onshore breeze), is very long, not thick, and rises and falls in the water like a black plastic sheet - people find it non-threatening - just some flotsam or jetsam from a fishing vessel, possibly
A school of fish
Probably a floating whale carcus
ti htan telika?
its the very rare caribbean carpet
INTERESTING VIDEO................................11,963,039 VIEWS, ¬† ¬†YEAH !!!
Yes hats it quite people run towards it. Smh
seaweed, a net
These are all over the beaches everywhere. It&#39;s a school of fish. It is creepy looking though
Its not one animal.¬† That&#39;s a typical movement of a school of bait fish. Look how it moves, changes shape etc...¬†¬† Im more surprised about how close it came to people.¬† Rays etc don&#39;t change shape like that, and plastic sheeting doesn&#39;t suddenly move the other direction in the current, so no, its not one big fish/ray/shark or etc, its a whole lot of small ones.
Its just a school of fish lol
that is definetely not a creature... people wouldn&#39;t have gotten so close so carelessly if t were
This is drunked russian tourist
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGywKooNMfQ&amp;t=71">1:11</a>
its a school of fish thats why it reacts to the waves and if it was as big as that folks would be running away not walking towards it
its either a sea eel which can get to around that size or a plastic tarp from a boat
im pretty sure if something that big was in the water people would be getting out instead of jumping in....i call bullshit¬†
The Blob.. or the Creature from the Black Lagoon..
I was so sacred I most pee my pants<br> 
I think it was a big ass stingray
Okay either that&#39;s some type of fish or some type of giant piece of plastic in the water.. The only reason why i say that is because one it looks like it&#39;s moving with the waves of the water or two it&#39;s underneath water and the waves make it look like it&#39;s moving with the waves.¬†
dumbs thats a manta ray
It s √† lot of smallest fish cock suckers!!!
???????? well who ever filmed it,must of spoke to people after and they were stood right near it..so disapointed there&#39;s no more info on it,,or its not this persons video footage
is that kaiju blue ??
They (people) should have gathered side by side behind and beside it .. therefore .. forcing it more on shore for a clearer look. Yes ! it was a school of small fish or anchovies ?
I don&#39;t think sea weed move close to u<br>
So wat the fuck was it
They were all Humans.<br>Predominately land based creatures they can use jointed limbs to swim or paddle¬†
Lol I love how everyone runs to it like the thing will be freindly and give presents :3
school of fish
I think it&#39;s a video of someone drowning.. But then whoever made the video edited a dark shadow imagine into it. I could be wrong, but that&#39;s what it looks like to me.¬†
could be a dead whale
Sea weed
could be a cluster of small fish¬†<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZwmVd9kF5Q">http://youtu.be/KZwmVd9kF5Q</a>

is it a fish? it is something else? NO ITS A SCHOOL OF FISH!
Thousands of small fish must have been separated by the rest and found themselves here I guess. Or it could be a sea creature we have never seen before. Sounds more logical to me...
What really is stange is the lack of reaction of people = shit of bull vid.
Someone must of had taco bell.
sting rays can&#39;t get that big..
it&#39;s my grandma

Oarfish

I was watching grumpy cat and this video showed up
GREEEEECE FOREEEEEEEEEVEEER
its a giant turtle
I wonder why he didn&#39;t move closer to get a better view while everyone seemed to be running excitedly to see....
Is it me or why is all of the other people just swimming in the water watching what this so called creature and dunk their heads down in the water and try to get a closer look? I&#39;m just saying!!!
maybe its a huge pile of oil and other chemicals mixed in to make it clump together like that or it might even be a giant stingray
I was there and no one thought it was a school of fish.
Its Rays not fish, fish jump even when the water moves by someone, they come right upto people
ssssoooo what is it?

It&#39;s a deflated rubber boat, or something similar, like a piece of plastic tarp.

that is a oar fish

I AM from Asia, but never seen such stuff like this... Only UFO&#39;s that I have seen with my naked eyes. I havent ever told anyone about what I saw those horrible nights... Including appartions aand Ghosts and stuff, but never &#39;Sea dragon like stuff&#39;.
its obviously not scary or deadly or people would be screaming and jumping out of the water
it looks like a simple school of fish 

i seened this many times, its not in the water its under the ground
this was in Greece i think...in Santorini
