Yo no sé pero ni Jason Statham Ni Keanu Reeves me convencen a mí como peleadores de artes marciales
ワイスピこのコンビ好き(*^ω^*)
Amo o jason statham
This is not only a movie
the best F&amp;F
The praises on Dwayne 😊
Hi ❤❤❤❤❤❤
They were the beest of fast and furious......That&#39;s why Vin loves the Rock.
i would prefer to have jasons fighting technique and quickness over dwaynes big muscles lol
Very hard work
Я бы на их реальный бой посмотрел бы!!!
Work work work its even harder when you dont and when you get older
James wan👻
Both Jason and The Rock play movie role’s as “the good guy and the hero”.<br>But then WHAT IF they found themselves fighting each other for the wrong reason?
I just wana be happier
For me this is the best one on one fight I ever seen in a movie
It&#39;s cool that no shaking camera was used.
Jason Statham. What a lovely guy. I have met him in person and he is so down to earth 👍
Paul is not dead he is just waiting for us at the finish line
Man James Won is the best.
I was always disappointed that Jason Statham wasn’t cast as The Hitman.
Jesus the rock is loaded to the gills!

That since was awesome 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😎😎I saw that movie several times
Pro there&#39;s some parts blocked I can&#39;t see them why??!
Jason Statham ❤️
This deserves to go down as one of the legendary action scenes from the 2010s
👌🏽👌🏽👌
Туфли то кросы у декарда
Bom filme tô querendo ver o 9
You two are not action movie star but jus a actor. Real action movie star must be a martial art person who do everything without any stund double, wired or computer
Love the rock!!!!

Rock said it was refreshing to bang it out with him... in Jamaica we say that&#39;s yyyyyyyyyyyyy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Jason
Nice muvie very nice 👍
THE ROCK is my all time FAV
Mientras la roka filma sus películas asu primo le están dando una putiza en la wwe
Jason
Jason sthatham my favorite actor and great Martel artist in the world
Dwayne may be the most buff guy but Jason always fights with style
https://youtu.be/zvI-_wVaYys
https://youtu.be/zvI-_wVaYys
Jason: Thank god its a movie <br><br><br>Lmao 😝
Jason fights like a well trained military fella. Like special ops training etc. Plus his fighting choreography is amazingly elegant. Something you would expect from a trained military guy. He fits the profile very well. <br><br>Rock fights like a wrestler. Pounces like one too. His weakness is his size,  which makes him bulky and slow. But it also is his strength. <br><br>Fighting is much more about your mental ability and strength than it is about your physical strength. Both have very different body types and fighting styles. That&#39;s what makes their fighting chemistry great.
&quot;It was very refreshing to bang it out with him&quot; - the rock. Never knew the guy was gay...
No doubt The rock is stronger but Jason is more resourceful with the things around him....
👍🏻👍🏻
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgvLvRWMMfc&amp;t=83">1:23</a> omg
I can watch jason statham fight my whole life
&#39;thanks god it is a move- standing in-front of this huge guy.... &#39;&#39;
Pero no falta el Marrano que vea esas pendejadas
Qué caspa de películas unos bobos para arriba y para abajo haciendo mala cara y no les pueden pegar y nunca les ganan
Chicas pague película ya van para la 20 y unos idiotas que no les pueden pegar para arriba y para abajo en unos carros haciendo mala cara
This was the most badass fight I have ever  Jason do

Those who think than jason martial art can beat the rock ,the rock one proper  punch on the mouth can demolish you jaw make you think twice to go again for the beast
Fast 11 and fast12
Haa rock kimondare 👍👍👍
PERO  DECKARD SHAW NO DERRAMA SANGRE CON TODA ESA PALIZA
I think this movie has lost what it known beat for and start with a lot of impossible shit that just don’t make it as interesting
How could I get a job on set doing things like this.

James wan from singapore
Jason is my hero!!!<br>Oh my god!!!
Paul walker would never have thought that this will be his last film of fast and furious franchise Which he will complete full
The same guy who made Aquaman.

hay rock
Think of this as a WWE TLC match. First the fight starts off with Jason kicking Rock through the window. Then it intensifies Rock drops Jason through desk and then comes the interesting part Jason gets Rock Bottomed through the table.
I dunno why the glass didn&#39;t cut em.
I could watch jason statham fight all day!
カッケェ
