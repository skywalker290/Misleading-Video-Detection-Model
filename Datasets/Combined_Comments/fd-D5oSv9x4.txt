Bhai log!!! Yeh kalpanik hai asal mein aise breakup karne se aap par kitne bhi fake charges lagae ja sakte .. yeh hmare mothers ke zamane ke aurat nahi aaj ke ran**yan hai , please handle maturely
Girls and boys..<br>This topic will never ended..<br>Kitane bhi comments karlo,,kitne bhi movie,, video banalo,, chatting karlo, debate karlo..<br>Jo he wo he,,aur reality,, ladko aur ladkiyo ko bhi pata he..<br>Par accept karne ki,, statement karne ki himmat sab me nahi hoti..<br>Real man- pure girl ,, still a Mistery..
Single...😎
1 minute silence for the simps, who get serious with the girls with male best friends.
Good old days when Kartik Aryan used be a good actor
I f u😂😂😂😂
That&#39;s y I don&#39;t trust anyone.
Chutiya love....😅😅😅😅
I think best frnd ka bhi zarurat hain, Life hain Relation hain to bhi ek achcha dost hona chahiye boy/ girl jo bhi ho, Best frnd hona chahiye bt aap ko Loyal rehena chahiye apke partner ke saath, Loyal ho to Best frnd hain bhi to kya hua par agar aap Loyal nehi ho to Best frnd nehi hone se bhi kya faida !!!
Usne galat kya kis tha??
Powerful scene and the love story is beautiful ❤💝💜💖😻💐
I&#39;m so fortunate. My wife never had a best friend.
Bada chutiya word h I love you
Bharucha perfectly fits in role of a bitch, a bitch who has ruined my school years.
When boys decides to play....😎
कहानी अभी ख़त्म नहीं हुईं<br><br>उसके बाद लड़की ने हरसमेंट, मॉलेस्टेशन का केस किया <br><br>लड़के पर लिव इन रिलेशन पर रहते हुए बलात्कार किया और शादी से मुकर गया का आरोप लगाया <br><br>फिर लड़की सनी के साथ सुख से जीवन बिताती है और लड़के पर 376 लग जाती है और उसे जेल हो जाती है 🙏🏻
Wish he says all three at last &quot;Bitch&quot;   &quot;Bitch&quot; &quot;Bitch&quot;
Should have kissed all three !
Kalyug ka prasad hai ye sab me batega, aaj nai th kal beta tera b katega! 🤣

Sometimes we just tired of forgiving them and crushed our self respect for them this is worst feeling when you beg to someone to stay with you and at that your self respect just ended i felt this pain they just used as a object 💔 this is not about gender it is all about person character 💔💔
सस्ते और झूठे शब्द ....👌👌👌💐
I love this Movie 🤩😍🥰
Ladkiyon ki sachai dikhane ke liye thanks pyar ka punchnama ladkiyon ne hi sikhaya ki unse pyar kyun nahi karna chahiye BC MC hamari paise pe sirf hamara hak hai na ki tum kuttiyaon ka

Arrey BC 😂🤣🤣🤣😂 kiss kar diya 😂😂🤣🤣
Guys can be toxic too, it&#39;s not always women.
Fatiye diyeche
Yeh sahi hai... <br>Kuch bhi karlo, phir last mein, <br>&quot;Sorry, jaane do na... I LOVE YOU&quot; waala card khel do and expect everything to be okay...<br><br>Kabhi kabhi sochta hun, agar yeh invasion of privacy reverse hota toh kaisa hota ...<br><br>When people can judge you and not only form opinions but spread those opinions about you to all your College mates, tuition mates, school mates, office mates, flat mates, gym, internship,NGO and so on... You name it and the place or the person is infiltrated and turned against you , doing their bidding and passing on your information to them... <br><br>What would have happened if the situation were to reverse... <br><br>Which ugly truths and details were to spill...<br><br>Guess , I don&#39;t the have to reverse the situation to find out...<br><br>You have hinted and said a lot already...<br><br><br>I wish no one in the world gets false-friends like you people who drive one to his/her suicide... Plant false friend around them, make them feel lonely, useless and incompetent, make them go into depression , turn their college life into darkest period of their lives, try to botch up their careers, leave them scars that refuses to heal and opens up every now and then oozing bad memories and nightmares... <br><br><br>And surprisingly there are people helping her in this... I mean how screwed the world can be to be hearing one side of story and believing it and helping them to extract revenge... <br><br><br>And REVENGE for what exactly?<br><br><br><br>Did I ever go back on my words... Was I the One who cheated with your best friend... Was I the One who had long calls with your best friend... Was I the One who went in relationship with you on advice of your best friend... Was I the One who said sorry to you before we kissed... Was I the One who cried afterwards with guilt weighing in my heart knowing fully well that I shouldn&#39;t have just kissed someone just to settle scores with your best friend... Did your best friend ask you about for how much we snogged... Or was I the One who goes about clicking pics with your best friend years after passing out and spending times together getting cosy over milk shakes and lattes... <br><br><br>Yes I lied and I accept it... Call it my childishness or plain stupidity... I lied because somewhere deep down there I felt in no perfect world would someone like you be ever interested to go out with me and beneath that all tough confident charm I was pulling in my high school years, I felt maybe I am not good enough for you... I found myself falling for you even before I could help myself or before I knew who you were... <br><br>I remember that embarrassing time when we were returning from Maths tuition , Omkara classes, Arunodaya market and you said you had to take a turn as your house was near and I without thinking made a quick exit into an alley so as to look cool and not be perturbed with you wishing to part ways... But embarrassingly found myself in a completely strange and unknown alley of which I had no idea... That&#39;s the level of childishness and stupidity I was operating on...<br><br><br>Nevertheless with all the things said and done, even if I lied , today with grace of God, I have the capacity to turn each one of my lies into truth... I can always work harder to be more successful, richer and famous than before... And I will be inshaAllah , all in my own good time , not to win or impress you... <br><br><br>But the scars that you gave me, the years of pain, humiliation, torture and games you played... No one can undo them or erase those dark memories from my life... You can never fix those traumas that pushed me to the point of suicide or ease the feeling I felt when I was experiencing them or going through them... Even thinking about those dark college days brings tears in my eyes... There&#39;s not a single shred of happy thought that I borrow from that hell-hole... <br><br>But you had a blast there at my expense , didn&#39;t you? Well done KM . Really well done. 👍<br><br><br>But you know what hurt me the most... That all this time, you didn&#39;t even think me as a human being enough to stop the incessant torture and humiliation... Even people don&#39;t do this to their worst enemies , what you did to me... <br><br><br><br>Anyways I was kind of saving the above confession for your birthday next month but don&#39;t think it matters now... Nobody in their right mind would ever think that this could ever work and with present Govt and Media machinery in place which makes all Muslims look bad, this is not only impossible but for something like this to happen, even the slightest possibility doesn&#39;t exist... I think I am just being delusional and for all I know you never cared for these wishes or random you-tube comments... Heck! I don&#39;t even know if these make it up to you and you ever read them...<br><br><br>There you go another stupid act I have dragged on for years now... Maybe its finally time to close this chapter once and for all times to come...<br><br><br>Agar mujhse koi galti anjaane mey(kyunki jaane buch kar maine aaj tak tumhe hurt karne ki koshish ya saazish nahi ki) ho gayi ho , jisse aapko takleef pahuncha ho , please maaf kardena...<br><br>I AM SORRY. <br><br><br>Wishing you all the best.

Ek committed ladki ke single female friends, uske sabse bade dushman hote hai! ~ Chanakya (probably) 😏
It&#39;s happens in  real life
Kamaal hai yaar ye .....
The best part is when he said ILY to her friends too, it was just so casual😭😂
Girls apne friends se discuss kre vo friendship boys kre to tum sabko dhindhora peet dete ho relationship ka<br><br>Esa kyu?
I love you😂
Break up 💔 ho toh Aisa
I&#39;m also a girl.. but  I don&#39;t have this kind of friends. Actually eysi ladkiyon k wajah se hi sari ladkiya badnaam hai..

Jo cheat krti hain unn randeeyon ke bare m ye comment nhi h but jo normal one guy at a time wali ldki h, unke liye ye comment h !!! &quot;Bestfrnd hone m koi burayi nhi h but there must be a fine decent line between a bestfriend and a boyfriend !!! Agr bestfrnd ke sath bhi whi sb kr rhi ho jo boyfrnd ke sath kiya jata h, emotional attachment etc tb kya frk h dono m ??? Bestfriend ke ander bhi faltu m feelings jga rhi ho aur boyfrnd ko bhi bura lgta h !! Ab ya toh frnd ka dil tutega ya toh boyfrnd ka... Tmhara kya h, tmhare pas toh hmesa ek extra choice hoti h, you just have to choose !!
Ldkiyan Boyfrnd ke samne bestfrnd ke gaand se aise chipkengi jaise janm janm ke bichhde ho, laudi kisi ek naaw m safar kr, ya toh bestfrnd ke gand m hi ghus, ya boyfrnd ke... Sala jb Boyfrnd se ldayi hota h toh kud ke best frnd ke pas chal.jaygi, aur jb Boyfrnd sorry bolega tb bestfrnd ko chhor degi...  Itna agr boyfrnd kre apni female frnd ke sath tb toh gand jal jayga aur brk up ki dhamkee degi ki usse bat kiya toh mai ja rhi 😂 khud itni narrow minded hoti h aur dusro ko broad minded hone ki salah deti h... Khud 75 ldko se gale milti rhegi aur boyfrnd kisi se bat krle toh shakk !!! Inn behennn ki lawadiyon se Relationship rkhne se better h sala admi single rhe 😂
bete moj kr di ...🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My Favourite Sence 😂😂🤣🤣 Jaise lag raha hai I love u ka koi game chal raha hai 🤣🤣😂😂

Dec 2019 when I broke up after seeing my girlfriend cheating on me for years, again and again and taking me for granted.<br>Till date it just ruins my day when I even see a movie clip of someone cheating. I don&#39;t know how these people who cheat live with themselves.
kartik aryanis best actor
Back Ground Music Name plz
Ye scene mein cringe kuch alag hi hai
everythiing aside <br>that breakup kiss ,,, hits different
Those three breakups were the most satisfying scenes of the movie 😊😂
Iss movie ko dekh k apni maa par aur zyada pyaar aata hai yaar!  Pyaar toh wohi karti hai
Arey @ocean sir pubg ki casting mein kAmal yaha bhi kamal
Among those three, this was the best way to breakup. Loved it
tharak nahi chode but end me<br>😁
U nailed it kartick..
Me apne friends ke sath gayi ye movie dekhne<br>Before movie - yrr kab tak single rahenge..ek gf dila de<br>After movie - bhad me jaye love..chahiye hi nhi gf 🤣🤣🤣
I am still waiting for that famous human being who will come here just to comment how &quot;misogynistic&quot; this entire film is and that we must file a petition in court to ban it. Where are you girl?
Today&#39;s generation don&#39;t know the real meaning and feeling of love,it&#39;s just become a time pass, game and status for some people,,,love based on understanding,trust ,and believe,,,when you break this ,,no meaning of realationship,,,when you love from your heart,you have no confusion,,,but girls confused about it,,, firstly identify/clarify ,who your friend and who&#39;s your BF, otherwise due to one&#39;s love so many people specially,male suffering from this situation,they lost their time, energy,money  on this ,so don&#39;t do this time pass and vulgarity in the name of love &amp; defame ,,love,. Love is pure and immortal!!
Best part of this movie

👍most of them ladki ya ladke ko bigadne me unke dost ya roomate hi hote hain...
Their attraction qualities are different ony same skin colour
One minute, she was upset and was discussing something with her friends, was she wrong there? Is it not normal to go on to ask your friends should I break up with him or not?<br> I mean, I don&#39;t get this whole thing completely.<br>Though, I do not support getting extra close with your guy friend especially when you are in a relationship.
Corona to India: I love you
Ye to me bhi manti hu cheap words 😶
Lagta hai pyar Ka punchnama movie ke director Ka Kisi ladki ne buri Tarah kaata hai !!!!
Same situation with me. My ex also looks like Nushrat Bharucha. Such a relatable scene.
I Love you is the most misused word 💔
One of the best sense
Kitna sach h iss ek scene mei bc 😐
No one but Karthik
ये मुव्ही नही है सच्चाई आज की.
I tried same with my ex , but my bluetooth didn&#39;t connect , than they said they can&#39;t hear it , and blamed me for recording , and she broke up.. 😆
I love you😂😂😂

Kya chutiyapa hai be
L***e  lag gaye background me chal reha tha didi k...😂😂
It is hard to believe in girl in term of love becoz they have turned chief to the libes &quot;I L U&quot;...
As a girl who just have boy best friends...idk about other but for me all of them are like brothers....and whenever is see a girl too much like too much clinging on guy like how nushrats character did idk but ok <b>laying headin her lap ok a lot of us do</b> <b>making food yeah!!</b> But bro u would never ever sleep with him if I have a boyfriend honestly I was so glad that kartik trusted her even though he had a feeling still he trusted his girl....he deserves better and thank God!! Broke up......as a person whose my St of the friends are guys while watching the movie I definitely too felt chiku was cheating .....*while picking a stone she lost a diamond* damn!! Me and my boy best friend are like Tom and Jerry but they treat me like sisters ........I would never let go of such a man who trust me and take care of me like how anshu did......
Your friend circle gives your character and your choice description.
Hahaha
Pyar sach me hi sali aisi chutiya chiz h
I watch this movie before I get into rltnsip so that  I can be in my senses 😆

Favourite scene
Best break up ever
People with brain and who knows the value of friendship would have asked the person in a relationship to talk to his/her partner and sort it out. If it isn&#39;t still resolved  then do whatever you think is right &amp; not what your friends think.
if you have a best friend who is male and you also has boyfriend is don&#39;t wrong but when you get too close with best friend is wrong please don&#39;t do that to anyone
Maan gye bro .... break up time par bhi ...kiss ...🤓🤪😎
Epic scene
I watched this movie at the theatres with my then girlfriend  and one of her female friend , after the movie they were like we&#39;re not like this, this is too much and shit. <br>And now she is with her friend&#39;s  boyfriend.<br><br>Moral : sab Ladkiyan chutiya nahi hoti par koi ladki apki chutiya khaat sakhti hai
50,Rs kaat overacting ke
This is my favourite scene
I love Tina..
Happened with me but I was at place of kartik🙄
Pyaar kisi ko bhi chutiya bana sakta hai
I m a girl. But i like dis movie ladko ko thoda hard hona chheye halki sb ladkiya aise nhi hoti but jo hoti hai to ladko ko aise hi krna chheye thoda to attitude me rehna chheye ye nhi ki laabr laabbr kr rahe hai ary apni self respct bhi hoti hai ladko ko sheekhna cheye iss movie se
Bc kya bkchodi h ye
Seriousness aside<br> I want that phone which can record that high quality voice.
Hahahahahahaha
Nice
Niyat se hi kamini thi by thakur
I love you😂😂😂😂
Breakup se pehle akhri chummi le lu...kisi ko kya hi pata chalega 😝

At last, Breakup krna tha toh kiss q kiya😁😁😁😅
🔥

Swaad aagaya phir se
Aisa kya galat  tha recording mai... It&#39;s normal. Maine aj tk kbhi bhi apni best frnd k bf ki tarif nhi ki. Hm hmesha ldte h but my besty handles it very well.
😂😂😂😂😂
आइ लव यू आईलवयू खेले

I love you 😟😟😟😟😟😢😢😢😞😞😞😞i love some one so much 😞
Mai toh thapad zaroor marta
Its real natural and everone should be ready for this also if he she is in a relationship
Best way to breakup. Anyways the girl was definitely wrong.
Love apnai app mai ek duniya ushe koi badnam ni kar skata hai,,,but i Love u kehnai bala har koi sacha nhi hota hai,kitna sashta or ghatiya cheap word hai ye,,,
Ladkiya ko izzat v chahiye pyar v chahiye trust v chahiye care v chahiye azadi v chahiye or ladko ko sirf ladki h sath zindagi bhr ka sath chahiye
Guys want hot chicks, good looking face  &amp; then they blame all girls. <br>Boyz blame urself that u r the ones who r running behind Only Looks  then u should NOT expect all good characteristics.
Gaand maar di launde ne 🤣🤣🤣🤣😎
इससे ज्यादा तो इसकी दोस्त हरमी है।।<br>ऐसे दोस्त बहुत मादार चोद होते है।।।
girls ki girl friend hi sali haramu hotihai
This was my favorite scene 🔥
Sahi baat hai ye frnd logo se bht pareshani hoti rltn me chahe ldki ho ya ldka frnd
Best scene of the movie
Rumours is that they are still dancing in a circle cheering i love you
In bhend sacne  he say s I hate you
The best scene 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Agar yhe tumhari chut jaisi shakl se pyar nehi hua hota na to batate Kitna Bura Lagta h hme
Isko Bolte Hain baithake chhodna
Best scene
I want to see the movie.....❤
I am a girl and I too believe that being over closed with a friend by giving a name of best friend is completely wrong
Perfect movie, truth of today&#39;s society
There should be no need of male best friend, if you have hubby or bf, you should make your hubby a best friend, Kabir Singh is latest example, why to involve third person if you truly love each other
Everything that is shown in this movie is truth of today&#39;s society
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd-D5oSv9x4&amp;t=190">3:10</a> yup bro

Ye totally scene mere sath hua h..but in reverse...I&#39;m a girl nd my bf do ..ditto like this butvh girl with me for d sake of his friends...I still love him and missing him so much yar
Lover friends are dangerous guys be careful
Ye movie dekhke pyaar se vishwas uth jata h....
Awesome...acting by kartick
What a powerful scene, this.<br>Finally, a love story from a man&#39;s perspective.<br>In a world filled with movies that criminalize the male gender, this movie is a stark opposite one. Yet, a harsh truth, a truth that none likes to accept.<br>Women too do shit.
Personally.. This was my favourite scene ever..!!👍
😜
I love you 2👍👍👍👍👍👍
