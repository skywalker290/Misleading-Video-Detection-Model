ALL MERMAIDS ARE FAKE,  IN CASE U DIDN&#39;T KNOW!
so fake YOU CAN SEE KNEES
fake
fame
U can see the knees
that&#39;s not real you can clearly see both of her legs
wait... how can she breathe underwater
real
i like the tail
This was fake!! If you look closely at the bottom, you can see her feet!! But the real question is how did she breathe, and Get out the water! if she was a real mermaid, she would have swam away because mermaids don&#39;t like their cover being blown that they are mermaids!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIq06bBGsPk&amp;t=16">0:16</a> wtf is that scream?!
Obviously it&#39;s fake, guys. Her entire channel is the exact same thing. The point of this is to raise awareness for marine life.
she is fake cos the mermaid went to get air when she went up and u could see her feet and knees
fack
this is not real
How does she breathe
of course the mermaid is fake what a silly answer how can the mermaid is real

stop the video a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIq06bBGsPk&amp;t=122">2:02</a> then look at the lower body u can see clearly that it bends u can see the natural bodyshape bends like knees<br>where this wouldn&#39;t be present if it were a real fish
fake look at the body lower half when it swimms u will see theres a bend which is the natural way human legs bend<br>but if u look at a fish the body would stay straight completely with no bends at all hence for this is fake
very intertening
this is fake because look how her legs bend anyway fake as fuck
this is face she is only a girl people
Real mermaids are scared of things like people.
the tail is not supposed yo bend like that this is totally fake
How did I end up on the weird side of youtube.

She has trained for years and the last time I checked she is able to hold her breath for up to 4min and 32s, the world record at the moment. :)
Wow
Wow
Response to someone who&#39;s username I forgot xD<br>The government would obviously allow mermaids in an aquarium due to all of the people wanting to view a real mermaid. The owners of the aquarium would of course have to pay extra to enter. It would be a struggle getting them into the aquarium because they are said to be deadly and vicious but it is their habitat and nature
I don&#39;t know how she can hold her breath that long! Also that water is so clear! 
That&#39;s fake mermaids don&#39;t look like that
fake
She holds her breath for very long😡😡😨😨😡😡😨😨

Thats a pretty tough job.
She&#39;s not a real mermaid.
is it real ? -_-
Wow! Japan has evidence of mermaids!!!
wow its awsome
O_O
No, she is not a real mermaid. They sell fake mermaid tails now and have professional mermaid actors. Some have been doing the mermaid business since they where 6. Practice makes perfect.
Real becuase i cant even breath that long!
Ok update, it&#39;s a woman playing a mermaid.. just type in &quot;The Journey of Mermaid Melissa - Real Life Mermaid Update&quot; and you&#39;ll see who she is, I think she does a great job.
-.-

Are u a real mermaid??
There has only been little video proof of mermaids and they weren&#39;t at all associated with interacting with people.
shes a real mermaid
If it&#39;s salt water then how are her eyes opened in it? Obviously only certain fish can open their eyes in salt water and live in salt water also a human can only hold their breath for the amount of 5minutes as long as they are still, calm, and relaxed. That&#39;s proof that she could possibly be a real mermaid
my 9yearold love this
You know what was funny about this was I saw that exact same &quot;mermaid&quot; on a channel where she was teaching kids cool water tricks I will comment below the name of the video :)
how can u hold your breath that long
NICE mermaid

nice mermaid
I love  it★
Guys its for the kids, stop the hate!
There is evidence of mermaids being real. I watched a documentation on the recent discovery of a dead mermaid. Two boys caught it on tape they were freaked out when it lunged up seeming to try and breath. It was amazing they said in the documentary that the navy and government were trying to keep it hushed up and they were only ably to show the footage now. Look up mermaids the body found.
i knew that girl ..i just dont remember her name ....
Fake only really only wow
Apoko si!!! :p
I mean that mermaid is not a real one mermaid have this kinda skin on there hand
Not real
Is this legit? Is she a real mermaid

...that should be fake...cause u can see the leg bending n like she have a knee...
Wow people shut up with the &quot;it&#39;s fake&quot; comments. Of course it&#39;s fake. She&#39;s a mermaid performer and her title is &quot;Real Life Mermaid&quot; just it straight. 
If it was a real mermaid her knees would not be bending Dahl

So fake
Cool, but just a real girl in a mermaid-tail :P How does she hold her breath for so long?
 1 we all know it&#39;s fake<br>2 stop saying it&#39;s fake<br>3 it&#39;s a job -_-
Melissa :D 
It&#39;s not suppose to be real<br>
I think this is real besides who would want to swim on a tank with a shark if it can&#39;t breathe underwater
That mermaid would not show it face or web hands
I don&#39;t think this is real mermaid, guys! Real mermaids never wear bra!!
Wait there&#39;s a mantray it could shock her
Obviously computer animation
That was cool and also scary
People who dislike and say fake are retarded lol
Fuel the imagination of children

I love mermaids (because of the tail) if they did exist today, they would probably be in danger because of human pillution and some people might try to capture them
Don&#39;t be such a kid,it&#39;s a perform.

with enough practice you can hold your breath more than 15 minutes.. my record is 2 minutes tho
