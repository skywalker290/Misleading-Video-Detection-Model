I&#39;m so proud of Nick Jonas marrying an older woman that can smother him with motherly love.
Priyanka is talented actress
Chonas is a good nickname

The fact that priyanka choose not to come to the front is a proof how much she respect Nick&#39;s  space and moment❤️❤️❤️❤️. So gracious

So blessed
Why all celebreties are uncomfortable while sitting in this seat
Jitna bhi pyar ho jaldi divorce na ho jaye
The way she was there and didn&#39;t enter to the spotlight 🔥🔥💕
I don&#39;t understand why we as human beings (and especially as &quot;fans&quot;) need to take a nuance about a famous figure and laud it with all the positive hyperbole in the world. <br>&quot;The way he respects her culture is so amazing and touching!&quot; Or, &quot;She is sooo down to Earth!&quot; Hmmm...looking within the grand human populace, you will see the same admirable traits. <br><br>Let&#39;s stop using histrionics to make situations look more than they actually are. <br><br>Start looking to your family and friends in association with that admiration. The people in this circle deserve it THE MOST, way more than any entertainment star. I will swear by it and I will promise you. This fawning over these &quot;illustrious icons&quot; is highly overrated and has gone on far too long.. And let&#39;s be truthful when assigning credits or kudos whenever we DO state praise. Because let&#39;s be honest: Any famous<br>figure captured on TV and in photos is ALWAYS going to appear in homage and appear to have only the best qualities  anyone can have. They are always going to put their best foot forward. But how they are in secret is their true character worth. And that is what we should focus on.
I watch both interview and They both have so many things to say about each other and I think that what true love is.
The way he respects Priyanka&#39;s culture is so adorable❤
“Prick”😂😂😂
Indians feel proud about this🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
NICK&#39;S &quot;LUCK&quot; THO LMAOOOO<br>(sounds a lot like me ngl)
It&#39;s nothing 10 years gap in america but in india.... It&#39;s 3rd world war 😂 😂

Priyanka makes every time proud moment for India,, all Indians celebraty go another country and getting married&#39; but Priyanka comes own home.. ❤️
&quot;Picnick&quot; :))
A Man who&#39;s priority is you ,and respects you and  engages himself in you like you do , is the one a real woman deserves.and I would choose to be that woman.. congratulating Priyanka and nick in Choosing the right one .
Priyanka and Jimmy are buddies
What&#39;s going on can you let me know what is the problem how so many man and women in my house and room  inside the wall what they are talking about
Me been thinking for 2 years ik it id nika lol
I think that is really cool that Nick Jonas can write his own plays and movies and I love that about him because I do the same thing and that is pretty cool
Note to self : don’t drink beer around Michale Keaton !! 🤣🤣
They must pull the chair and respect priyanka also
The way he respect the culture 🙌
why he is not wearing his wedding ring?
The cruel profit routinely peel because ticket histochemically radiate aside a typical part. guiltless, verdant cow
Their couple name could be &#39;NickYanka&#39; 💙
I like that way how to introduce as her half it&#39;s lovely ❤️ proud of u both
Why the audience is shouting as if there is a mass shooting going on nearby?
Is priyanka really in crowd?
What a supportive wife.
Now nick has became the jejuu of all the girls of india😂😂❤️❤️
They&#39;re nickname should be picnic 😂
Кисс

The right shorts pathologically guard because multimedia sadly employ underneath a cut move.  flippant, blue-eyed rat
Nick is very nice humble person. God bless him.
❤️❤️ Best couple ❤️ NP❤️❤️
This is Priyanka&#39;s husband?
Priyanka&#39;s confidence🇮🇳
Nick Jonas is incredibly well spoken. And just awesome ❤️
Nick : &quot;We met through a friend &quot; <br>Jimmy : &quot; I had a friend, a F*<b>*G A*</b> &quot;
i jus love his cutee little smile mannnn!!!❤❤❤
Priyanka’s reaction to Nick saying “she likes Prick” is everything !!! 🤣🤣
I love nick jonas
I didn’t know that Nick Jonas writes his own plays and movies that is so cool
They love you,<br>We love you,<br>I love you,<br>Then let&#39;s gets merried
Yeah!
Careful Nick ! 3 strikes your out !
Be careful the next time you drink around Michael Keaton Nick , or else we all know he will say “you better not be drunk” !
Marriage !

I&#39;m getting goosebumps while he&#39;s talking about Indian culture 😂
He calls her Prushi.... that’s lovely.
K guys why are there more haters and judgemental people in this comment section than I have seen under my favs ☹☹☹<br>Niyanka or i better call them Prick is my new favourite couple, even above Hailin and Joeler, they are so cute together they really do love each other a lot u can see that, but the comment section has negative people in minorities but in huge quantities whyyy<br>You guys need to understand that not everything which seems to be a business/clout chasing strategy was intended to be that way.
The way I laughed when he said Prick...
“Prick” , Pri and Nick , so slick we stick” I just made that up on the spot , I mean that’s really good for a thought , I’m a poet and I didn’t even know it !
He is rock why he married a mother looking woman question

POV: you love Prick.

I love the way how jimmy congratulated both of them unlike ellen. She acted so weird when she invited priyanka to her show.
So this is where Gino the Germans name comes from
He should have called her up
Tbh everything he explained about our is so precise.
How he respects and adores Indian culture...that&#39;s lovely

Y was priyanka there?????
the world best cute couple 😘😘😘
vsauce
I wonder who was the common friend? 🤔
Nickname -&quot;prick&quot;❤️
His maturity is greater thn his age, that&#39;s why he chose priyanka over Gomez
Love the way they both respect each other&#39;s culture .. 🖤🖤
The Prince of America and The Queen of India. Looks like fairy tale love story does happen in real life.
Why does it matter the age difference? Priyanka has a bubbly personality while Nick is very serious so he actually seems older then her when she&#39;s responded then him like 10 years is seriously not that muc h so y&#39;all need to calm down
Both priyanka and nick respects each other and thats the best quality one should have and look at nick the way he is describing roka ceremony and hindu tradition so well that many indian men wont be able to explain

Priyanka looks like his step mom.
If both of them are happy with each other I don&#39;t think any body should have problems. They are happy , there families are happy (the thing matters the most ) that what matters the most .
Both nick and priyanka have 13M views on this channel!!!
Was she in the audience really?

Nick is definitely more matured than his age. He is so composed and very simple , which is the most important thing difficult to be.
Audience reaction is kind of irritating
This should be the official nickname &quot;pricknick&quot; 😇😅🤗🤷🙆
He is really Gentemen<br>God bless both of them
😡😡😡😡 BTS
he forgot the jonas brothers secretly decided to get back together and would be announcing it in 5-6 month
dry bar comedy
Nick you are one lucky guy you choose a women with looks brains talent love and most of all a Indian she is like a diamond good luck to both of you 🙏❤️🙏
I love how Jimmy hates the name &quot;Prick&quot; here, but like a few months later he helping Priyanka promote it on this same show, lmao
Why do I always feel like jimmy is faking it.... Overdoing everything?
those woooohhs are so unbelievably annoying.
Such a controversial couple, There both of completely different cultures &amp; race and have a more then a 10 year gap. Haven’t really seen much of interracial couples in Hollywood.
Hey, what about Prick??🤣
I wanna hear Nick speak in Hindi...
Prick nickname
This guy never gets to speak...and even when he speaks it is like silence
NICK IS A GENTLEMAN!
I don&#39;t no how people get soooooo many likes i&#39;m the only one who doesn&#39;t get 1 likes
Well, He is the Son-in-Law Of India...👍👍👍👍👍👍♥️
So.... Priyanka+Nick= Prick<br> <br>I&#39;m like... Thank God Nick didn&#39;t get married to Deepika.😁
Nick Jonas is a man of fun
Nick and Priyanka a couple that prayers together stays together keep doing all the good things together and stay safe 🙏❤️🙏
He’s not even a manly man he’s a boy. I’m not hating but pc could’ve done better.
Really a unbreakable couple love you both 💙💙❤️❤️💞💞🇮🇳🇮🇳👌💕💕
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zag_tB4fgJw&amp;t=51">0:51</a> and that friend might be lily right
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zag_tB4fgJw&amp;t=39">0:39</a><br>When jimmy said priyanka who else thought that she was going to walk out and sit down
This couple is one of the most beautiful i have ever seen🤗
Thanks to priyanka ....we got to know him after marrying pc. ...he is very good human being
I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s aware of it, but he&#39;s setting quite a high benchmark for prospective grooms here
Perfect couple ♥️
Nick actually respect and appreciate Indian culture and all rituals ❤❤❤
priyanka + nick = prick
Anyone from India
I’m not trying to be mean- but I’m curious. How the hell can jersey produce MCR(my chemical romance) AND Jonas Bro’s? That crazy 😎 cool!! Seriously.🤙🏽
Both of them same horoscopes.
Hindu culture is very much beautiful
Priyanka is so beautiful
Who is this prick?????
Where can I find someone like him!!
The ohoh girls bursts my ear
I love yoy
Our Indian aunty stole this sweetest crush of world.....from all 😂😂😂😂😂♥️
Their couple are world&#39;s Best Couple.lots of love  from Nepal
My favorites among the favorites. Wish them much hapiness
Hes too young for her. It may not last
I like jimmy show instead of Ellen’s
I love how nick was so nice to indian traditions!💘
Roka he talking about its only matter that if u didnt fuk eacheacher before engangement
This ugli ass fuking prianka super model...
Well, all I can say is this guy is 7 billion times lucky to have a woman like Chopra, am officially jealousy but I ain&#39;t got nothing to do about it 😂
Prick causes BISEXUAL DISTRESS (but I also think they are SO sososo adorable 😍)
I get Priyanka and Nick&#39;s points on the Prick name. Priyanka likes it causes it does combine both of their names, and it sounds catchy. Nick is like &quot;We can&#39;t sell child-size t-shirts with Team Prick on them without opening a can of worms for parents to explain what prick means&quot;  HA HA!!!!
I am form NJ too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love you both👫<br>You&#39;re lovely together❤
After knowing that Priyanka is sitting over there in between the audience, Jimmy should have called her to sit next to Nick <br>Why didn&#39;t he called her? 🤔🙄😡

Nick Jonas may be in love with Priyanka because he would have so many other options except Priyanka, but Priyanka is definitely an opportunist and gold digger. Shame on her. <br>That host is a joke.
Nick is all heart 💜
You know Nick Jonas just got famous in India....In a population of 1.3 Billion only because of Priyanka.....Got a Bundle of audience in here in India only bcoz of &#39;PC&#39;<br>No one knows him here before priyanka&#39;$
I love you<br>We love you<br>You love me <br>I love me too<br>Hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂

Amazing shows by Priyanka Chopra is very good, just like quizzes,
“Jumped right in”
prinick

They were filming the doc here!!
After all this time, who sits sometimes and is just like &quot; I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re married&quot;
that is a M A N wowza
I love Pryanka and Nick bless them.
He is a midget
Nick doesn’t know how many hearts he broke with the engagement like if he broke yours
I honestly have no idea 😂 why people have such a issue with their  age difference and the funny thing is I have heard some American interviewers saying that Indians are conservative but the fact that most of whom are complaining about their age difference are Americans 🤣 like seriously grow up people 😂
Priyanka and Nick...Prick<br>Well, thankgod Deepika didnt marry Nick
Prick - Priyanka Chopra Jonas &amp; Nick Jonas!  What A Lovely Couple
I ship them so fucking much!!!!

Mature and respected couple ever seen.
I’m a fans of priyangka since she’s winning those miss world title and don’t even imagine she’s married to this American teen singer.. I thought she’s gonna choose one of Indian millionaire
Nick Jonas is younger than priyanka but is Soo mature I think they match each other perfectly. They must be really lucky to get each other. Love y&#39;all
I accidentally clicked this video and he s not actually joking but people are laughing
I actually like the name &quot; prick &quot;
Instead of &quot;Prick&quot;, what about Niyanka? Huh? Nick, let me know if you like it.
May I just say it’s funny that nick is the youngest Jonas brother but is wife is older than Kevin and he’s the oldest
Love them
The British accent tho  😍
He is a calm, mature and a wise guy .

Nick so mature over his ages ...love...just love can make them to be one....
Why is priyanka in the dark?
Nikos You are very respectful and nice guy <br>From Tibet
Priyanka Chopra’s father was accused of molesting a 12 yr old. She used her crown power and money to not make the story come out as it should be and the victim had struggled a lot. Post the incident she had a tattoo “ dada lil girl”. She as a woman and miss world never took up on the issue and instead defended a criminal. Sadly it’s her father. Very disgusting person and fake person and shame to the family.
Most of Hollywood celebrities wanted to marry nick jonas but guess who did the job an indian the one and only pryanka
I love that 😍😘😙💏💑
Nick-name get it?? This vid is about Nick Jonas? No.. okie
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Nick jonas is a man who is young talented cute and very down to earth. I dnt know how he fell in love with priyanka chopra....😁
Shiv Ji our ma durga in dono ki jori salamat rakhe....
Priyanka<br>Pr<br>Nick<br>  ick<br>You do the rest

What I feel is that Nick and Priyanka have a great understanding in their relationship
He&#39;s still wearing that yellow thread around his wrist from the &#39;ROKA&#39; ceremony!!💗

Симпотичный малый и вроди по лицу и поведению хорошый человек глаза немного  не подходят для полного положительного характера а так в опшем Прианке по везло с мужем но ему не очень по везло с женой она его сажрет .

Stiam că , acest gen de bărbat o atrage
Little different from Jersey is right
Introducing me.
Jimmy&#39;s guest are always funnier than him lol
india capture kashmier and killing in kashmier
Prick good match
She got married to him for US citizenship, quite evident man
I always thought Nick would marry Britney Spears, pop star royalty  👑
They were basicially datin online for 6months and then met up finally in person and dated for 5months b4 he proposed damn that&#39;s quick but i guess u know when ya know but this couple nick and priyanka not expected at all
Age is just a number. My bf is 6 years younger than me. We both are happy together. 😘😘😘😘😘
Ich love priyanka!!!!!❤️
they both look so cute together... some people are saying about their age but love does not see age.. it sees the feelings and emotions that people had for u....
bohot bohot cute lag rahe he😘😘😘
Priyanka was so professional that she didn&#39;t come to sit when Jimmy mentioned her. Such honourable and classy behaviour gave nick all the attention didn&#39;t want to take it away.
I watch that Movie, enjoys them game of survival
he is a boy and she is an old lady there is no chemistry
Koi na#5
I think priyanka is very nice girl,,,,she&#39;s ok for me for him than other Hollywood actress or American actress coz American actress is very fast to divorce after married in how so many years they together,,it&#39;s ok if other nationality......hope they still strong......
HELP what brand is the jacket Nick is wearing?? Thanks!!
This is the most transparent I have ever seen nick ... he must be veryyy happy fr
Am here after the marriage
Jimmy is Weird
Prick lmfao
This guy is fuckin awesome

Their celebrity nickname should be PicNic .<br>Who agrees??
Is priyanka chopra is their
Love you both😘😘
Congratulations nd God bless you both 😇😇
God bless them
U happy now??? Hmmm???
Nick jonas has more money and fans. The woman who will marry her will be recognised more .He is famous from his teens. He is still young and already more and more fans like any young American famous singer has.Cheers Mr jonas. ....
isn&#39;t she like, 10 years older than him?
I’m not here to watch the whole video just was wondering from thumbnail the couple name would be like (niriyanka /pick) lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6onjIXW9WS4">https://youtu.be/6onjIXW9WS4</a>
Why was Priyanka standing there in the corner???
If I was in  nick&#39;s place I would have called priyanka mom and not honey or dear 😜😜
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23jonanka">#jonanka</a>
She Likes PRICK 😂
They is a cute couple
Priyanka best of Nick Indian girl is very beautiful
Did u guys too notice that priyanka wasn&#39;t really there rather it feels like as if some kind of rays were projected...<br>I mean just look at the transparency of her image in that corner...
He defined &#39;ROKA&#39; ceremony  so beautifully <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23respect">#respect</a> 😊
See the level of other country Priyanka is also a celebrity eventhen she is not on stage.
Howww sweet... The smile on Nick&#39;s face when the host says &quot;Priyanka&quot; 😅🙈   both r perfect
Suddenly a fans of NP 😍😍 wishing them happy marriage ever after 😇😇
Niyanka
I can&#39;t believe this has over 8m views, lol
Female to male transgender    Nick Jonas   (Fake man)    {Research &quot;TransVestigation&quot;   on you tube } <br>in absolutely fake &quot;relationship&quot;   with priyanka.<br>Expect some big drama. <br>the entire wedding is a set up <br>Some sort of diabolical social re engineering drama involving India.<br>Priyanks is embarrassed to be involved in this but she has no choice she has sold her soul.
Love Ur genuineness nick... It&#39;s so bful to c u and Priyanka together
M I the only one who is not concerned about the video but the comments😂😂😂

El se ve angelical
Easiest way to get green card good luck
Good sent.
I find the whole thing a little bit sad.  Not God&#39;s best for a christian but then look at the downward spiral he&#39;s had through the years.  Doesn&#39;t surprise me he marries a girl like this.
Love you both.. Nick n pc
Wow I love this couple<br>May God bless them
He’s 10 years younger than her.. anyway they look good and love each other
Both of these plastic shit eating phonies are starved for validation.  Both depended on the temporary outer marketable appearance of their now gone youth.  Now they think they are ballers.  The grossest of the gross.  Nobody will tell them they’ve been over for a while now.
I guess there&#39;s finally a straight couple I ship just as much as Ellen and Portia 😁
Sooo beautiful nick
So cuuuuute
She don’t love she love your money
I still feel a bit awkward
he z so loving
Jumaji earned coz of Rock and Kevin and Jack not because of him.. .... Get your facts correct Jimmy..
He said &quot;She&#39;s the best&quot; twice.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zag_tB4fgJw&amp;t=46">0:46</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zag_tB4fgJw&amp;t=113">1:53</a>
Bc sbka ktega 😂😀🤣
Priyanka&#39;s is my favorite artis
he looks like a kid compared to her,, i dont see the appeal
She is ugly shit as hell
Priyanka needs to get pregnant NOW! She’s already 36😅 I won’t be surprised when the news come out in 3 months later or so after their wedding lmao
Super jodi
Looking forward to the divorce
True love happens suddenly.. that&#39;s prove!!! Just Look at him guys.. he is so excited while describing everything about her..
https://youtu.be/IqhqElhcEUU
Why is she keep sitting there......... FUCKIN RACISM!!!!!!
Nah man... At the end of the day! You India... You lose
I love the fact that despite Priyanka being there she didn&#39;t come infront and take away the spotlight from Nick on the show
I admire Nick as he shows lot of respect for the country &amp;  the culture she belongs to...but what surprised me was his tears.... while she walked towards him ....this shows all human are with same emoticons no matters what cultute... which place....I wish them good luck.
Congrats Priyanka on hitching the greatest fuckboy in Hollywood.
Or a nick chopra

The Bollywood Hollywood ARE VERY LUCKY.. BRO!! 🙄😒

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-4BzQEN3qA">https://youtu.be/o-4BzQEN3qA</a>
prick?
Nick you&#39;re such a real man, who is full of quality. You picked a women who is breathtakingly beautiful to settle down with.<br><br>Only a real man can see a women&#39;s value. (her heart, soul, spirit, character) Real men don&#39;t want the youngest they can get, to feel more like a man. They want someone who is enough. Someone who they share real love with.<br><br><br>I wish you 2 a lifetime full of joy ✨🤞🏽⭐️
What the heck Nick, are you a Christian turned into a Hindu??  What a waste!
Its amazing how they got to know each other’s for a short time but he loved her to marry her not for fun💓.

Is Nick wearing one of those bracelets that Hindu sisters tie onto their brothers? (Sorry my Hindu brothers and sisters, I forgot the name- I’m not Hindu) If that’s what it is that is so super sweet- he is so adorable.. love how he shows so much respect for Indian culture

Lovely couple

Nickyanka? Niyanka? Chonas? Jopras? Or we can just stick to prick

Foreigners always make fun of india then also desi girls want videshi product.For example ,see in this video where Priyanka is standing.
