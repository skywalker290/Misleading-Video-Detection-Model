Can&#39;t be perfect if I can&#39;t have access to half the features on android. Even on Bose, I can be connected to 2 devices simultaneously. On android I can&#39;t even check my airpod battery life
This released in 2019, now end of 2023 is there difference on quality &amp; feature? <br>I mean software-wise for the airpod pro 1
I&#39;m back to this video after 3 years almost and I have to say they are GREAT.
In Canada, the AirPods Pro are almost 400$ due to the currency exchange üò¢

The classic apple strategy of calling something pro for no reason
I like your AirPods man
Did anyone review what problems your gonna face exactly after the warranty üôÑ i had them for 2 years and couple of days. I rarely use them and now the sounds only comes from the earbuds while its in the charging box and disconnects as soon as i pick them up !  Every thing is fully charged but doesn‚Äôt help at all. Unfortunately Apple will simply tell u its out of the warranty ü§î go buy a new one thsts why i bought the cord kind its clear and way cheaper üòä
I just wanted to say thanks because this was super helpful for me!!
That was the worst intro he ever made can we all agree
They charge via lightning cable am I right? Please comment?

Review in 1 word : Average!
Currently watching with my airpods pro on noise cancelling
I&#39;m an Android person, but I have an iPad. My bro switched to Android, so I inherited his AirPods Pro, and it makes me happy to know it has ANC, which can help me with my work. Old version but still guaranteed to useful
I love the noise cancelling. I&#39;m sitting here in bedroom while my lawnmower guys are out front. Can&#39;t hear the lawnmowers.
Just got them today üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
‚¨áÔ∏èlike this comment if your wearing AirPod‚Äôs pro‚Äôs while watching this
So after having these for 4 months, they‚Äôve had to go back and be replaced 3 times. Blown speakers and connectivity/battery issues. Got so damned mad with them I literally threw them out of my truck while driving. I‚Äôm out $200 but at least I don‚Äôt have to send them back again and have to repair them to my phone every time I want to use them. Junk.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=105">1:45</a> Me coming back three years later when AirPods Pro Second Gen has volume control
broo i got this for my birthday and I was not expecting that noise cancelation it was trippy af for me
Who else was watching this with AirPods Pro?
how come you don&#39;t mention that these AirPods Pro are absolutely horrible when it comes to taking calls. Unless you are sitting in a completely silent room its impossible for others to hear you.
yea we definitely needed the volume controls on airpods, thankfully that was fixed with airpods pro 2
I have long hair and whenever I move the AirPods stop. How do I stop that?
whenever im thinking of getting a new device i watch this guys videos to decide
finally i wont have to listen to the vacuum

The human being who invented AirPods Pro is a genius and a life saver!!!

Best purchase i ever made
I think these for 75$ brand new is a pretty good deal.
Airpods Pro 2 review?
WF1000XM3
Watching this on my way to buying the AirPods Pro 2.
damn, apple heard you
I remember when I put these back in for the first time. There was a celing fan and the sound was so clear in transparency mode that it almost sounded like a wave of Oceanside. It took me a minute to understand where that sound was coming from, I though it was some kind of sound effect AirPods play when you plug in. Damn Ô£ø good job fr
the thumbnail idea was amazing
Your ‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening‚Äù acting is on point haha
It‚Äôs pretty wild how fucking profound of a product these things are. Everyone I know, work with, and see in public has a pair it seems
I‚Äôm tempted to buy these for ¬£177 UK price but heard a new version is due soon
Definitely I am planning switching to Apple products especially the earbuds Samsung currently makes is totally junk with connectivity issues even after repair!!
Do you really have to squeeze it? I thought you have to just tap
I‚Äôve tried 2 GEN hurt my ears, tried 3rd  GEN hurt my ears, tried studio buds, connection issues with 3 different pairs. Tried fit beats bro, fell out ears. Do I dare try these?
I‚Äôve had my pros for about a year now after going through 2 pairs of normal<br>AirPods, I love them so much, they sell for about 180-200 on Amazon, they‚Äôre phenomenal everyday earbuds that always get the job done well. I‚Äôd never consider anything else for myself personally
the thumbnail is epic. It‚Äôs like: AIRPOD-MAN
Sony for the win!

Dang boy that‚Äôs a brutal scar on your hand. Story?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=97">1:37</a>
Bro the production quality is mad
NC Works great‚Ä¶for my right ear.
Oh, my man was listening to Life is Good by Dynamic Duo. An amazing album called Lucky Numbers. Do check it out.
i‚Äôve had these for over a year now and they have some of the most ridiculous issues i‚Äôve ever dealt with. <br><br>every single time i use them there‚Äôs another issue to deal with before i can just listen to music or watch a video. after having them for only just over a year you can rarely ever just put them in and go. some days the left pod won‚Äôt connect and charge, some days the right won‚Äôt. you can clean the case and reinsert the pods over and over it won‚Äôt do shit. they work when they wana work. they randomly disconnect at times when literally doing nothing to cause that. some times one disconnects and you have to put them back in the case to reactivate it as if the fucking case forgot that pod existed. sometimes you‚Äôll be at full charge on both pods, put them on and then get a low battery ding only to see one of them had a fugazi charge and is now at 1% battery. <br><br>they work well when you first get them as any other product does but just know they‚Äôre fucking dogshit after you‚Äôve used them for a bit. not even the garbage ass old wired headphones they used to give out for free had this little of a product life expectancy üòÇ
Very good review.<br>I love these airpods, good buy.
Genius thumbnail
Marques, i used the foam tips and they feel better than the silicon from apple.
Excellent video
Zamn
You squish 3 times to repeat a playing song
Great
Did you test the mics ? They are so so bad and CANNOT be turned off, this leads to the hilarious situation of having to disable bluetooth on the go to speak into  e.g. whatsapp whenever you want to speak.
Someone said they‚Äôre jack of all master of none, does that make more sense than imperfectly perfect? Haha
for me, i love the no volume control on them. i ride a motorcycle to work and if my helmet moves on my head, there is a chance sometimes were where my old earbuds would just change volume sometimes. idk why but its whatever. this is a very nice improvement for me anyways.
Just picked up the pros. Way better fit then my AirPods 2. So glad i upgraded!

Bro that thumbnail is creative as hell.
Don‚Äôt buy this piece of s$&amp;$t! I spent almost 300$ and I‚Äôve been wasting my time to fix the discharging issuesü•µ
I originally owned a pair of Klipsch T5 McLaren editions and I loved them. They work great and sound good, but I work in the automotive industry, so I‚Äôm surrounded by grease, oil, dirt, debris and everything DIRTY.  The Klipsch worked great in loud environments with transparency mode on, but once the charging contacts got dirty it was almost impossible to get them to charge after a day at work.  I got these and sound is on par with the Klipsch but now I have no longer charging problems and the pro‚Äôs feel like nothings even in my ear unlike the Klipsch.  I go hours with the airpod pro‚Äôs in  and even sometimes forget I have earbuds in
Don‚Äôt waste your money on this inferior apple product. Get yourself a good pair of Bose earbuds. My AirPods cannot maintain a connection with my Apple devices. I constantly have to forget and then pair them to get them to work. They are a low quality product that are poorly engineered. Get Bose you will be much happier.
Well JABRA elite series are the BEST. Does everything perfectly in half the price
Wow creative arrangement of elements (Video thumbnail)
Do they leak sound
Never thought I&#39;d say it, but I think I&#39;m grabbing a set of these when I get the chance.  The price is high compared to what I normally spend on earbuds(I love finding the cheapest pair with decent audio), but there are just too many conveniences packed in here for an iPhone user.  The fact that I can use Find My on them alone is massive, as the only time I&#39;ve lost my current earbuds is when they&#39;re in the case.  And having had my current pair for ~3 years, it&#39;s obvious these are going to last me as long if not longer(the days of buying cheap earbuds because they&#39;ll die on you in a year anyway are long gone).
bro it says imperfectly perfect on shirt
Just got mine today and they are absolutely wonderful 10/10.
They haven‚Äôt dropped the price even after 2 years‚Ä¶.

watching these on my airpods pro
Watched the video then went and bought it
I the past two years I have dropped mine so many times, still working, those things may be easy to drop but they are pretty indestructible. Though I have dropped the case and almost every single time the case opens and my AirPods fly out, I&#39;ve had some really close calls.
how does the battery percentage  of airpods case  being fetched by the iphone when we connect through bluetooth?? Do case of airpods have inbuilt technology or hardware pieces to give information to the iphones?? ü§î

Watching this video using the AirPods Pros is really nice.
Sure the sony ones sound better but they are massive and look ugly
Should I buy them today?
WOW ... These are way better than the $16 earbuds with the wires that don&#39;t require charging ... ummmm ...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=472">7:52</a> but‚Ä¶ Apple
Cant wait to get my airpod pros but I live in Australia so with the noise cancellation too I‚Äôm scared of some eshays just grabbing them out of my earsüòÇ
you havent rreviewed the beats fit pro
Though the retails aren&#39;t that expensive to be honest, I still wouldn&#39;t bother buying them. I bought Navapods some time ago (for 50$ or so) and they work great. I&#39;m not an audiophile or anything but they sound pretty decent to me. But nowadays there are quite a lot of knock offs out there so you might get them even cheaper (I just can&#39;t recommend any since Navapods are the only ones I tried).
2 years later, I‚Äôm watching this in anticipation for AirPods Pro 2 üòÅ btw great content as always dude!
This video is really well made!
I&#39;ve had my AirPods Pro for about 6 months and they great earbuds that really help me with doing homework. They have excellent noise cancellation and transparency mode feels like your not wearing earbuds at all. Their a crucial part of my apple ecosystem.
Legit amazing for workouts! <br>I use to used the over ear Sony WH1000XM or whatever. Loved them. <br>These never fall out, and when you are benching they don‚Äôt slide back like over ear
its been 2 years since these released and still the best
i bought for my iphone 13 pro max , honestly the noise cancellation is unbelievable.
I wish you could use one as a controller without it being in your ear
thumbnail is perfectüëå
Nobody commenting on the shit quality of the microphones?
Can we get a ‚Äústill worth it?‚Äù Video PLEASE
No volume controls is an absolute deal breaker for me. So many songs/videos are at drastically different volumes. Battery sucks on these too, can&#39;t wait till the pro 2 comes out so I can upgrade from my pixel buds 2.or pixel buds 3, hopefully one of those drops soon
Nice
I get around 5h with noise cancellation on
Trying to figure out what case to get for them‚Ä¶
Ok let&#39;s be honest Sony has the best ANC on the market that&#39;s just a fact.  Sennheiser is right behind them.
Definitely not being able to change volume is something I would love them to change. I really love that they finally made &#39;wearable&#39; EarPods, I am so happy with them I can walk around with them the whole day!!
its 2022, is it worth to get this now?
memory foam tips are available now though
Airpods only playing in one ear on Macbook Pro (unless I keep Sound Preferences window open)<br><br>So, here&#39;s a puzzler. Over the last day, my normally-fine Airpods will only play through the left ear when connected to my Macbook Pro, but play fine through both ears on my iPhone. However, when I open the Sound Preferences window on my Macbook, the right ear Airpod connects. When I close that window, the right ear Airpod immediately stops. Is there a fix for this, or I am now taking this extra step going forward?
Please can you do airpod pro 6

I‚Äôve gone through two sets of beats and prefer the pro.
Nice review. But I fail to see a good review of the microphone quality of these. Using them not just for music but also calls and voice messages is going to be an essential feature for most users and I personally don‚Äôt think they are good at doing this job, for instance in noisy environments. What do you think? :) thanks !
Just got a pair of these for Christmas and I love them!!!
yes k lol
Just curious if anyone else has had the same problem as me with Pro&#39;s, when you move/shake your head fast you can hear the silicone tips shaking with your movement regardless of the size of the tip you use. If anyone knows what im talking about and has a fix it would be appreciated
I was hit by a bus while I was jay walking and these stayed on the whole time
A like for the thumbnail alone
SO NOBODY IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW AFTER 30 MINS WITH THE PROS IN YOUR EAR IT FEELS LIKE YOU CONSTANTLY GETTING PUNCHED IN THE EAR
‚ÄúPerfectly Imperfect‚Äù lol<br>Close enough.
Great video thank u!
I just got my first AirPods Pro after buying my first ever iPhone 2 months ago and wow they are so goooood! They are still some of the best earbuds I‚Äôve heard. The sound is awesome. It‚Äôs not overly bassy like Sony and the highs are also crisp. Transparency mode is so perfect. It almost feels like I am not wearing them at all. The noise cancellation is so close to my xm4 headphones, it really came of as a surprise. And what‚Äôs best is that it doesn‚Äôt put so much pressure in the ear thanks to the pressure vents. I wonder why other earbuds makers don‚Äôt copy the pressure vent system
People complaining about not being to adjust the volume but I do that with my apple watch and it‚Äôs still a great convenience compared to having to pull out your phone. I literally feel like I‚Äôm living in the future after I fully immersed myself in the Apple ecosystem
i think i‚Äôm alittle late to the giveaway
Is it me or are AirPods pro not that loud?

hi i like your videos and your reviews question could you for an homeworker compare the air pods pro 2 and max ?  thx
What a great video! You&#39;ve got skills! I&#39;ve always struggled with silicon tips as my ears are a strange size - do you think I&#39;ll have problems with these if I&#39;ve had problems with every other silicon tip? Standard wired apple ear pods work great for me though...
It&#39;s not a word, but its an oxymoron.
Me watching this while wearing AirPods Pro be like ‚Ä¶ üò≥
Just got some myself. Best earbuds I‚Äôve ever had. I usually go for over the ear headphones. But I wanted to get AirPods a try. I highly recommend the best earbuds or headphones I‚Äôve ever owned
Why is nobody talking about the fact he was listening to the best dynamic duo album ever???
Just ordered mine! So excited! Got a free engraving reading ‚Äúdingus‚Äù
Dont have volume control is such a bummer
Great video! My gen 1 airpods that I got maybe 3 years ago are dying out. They barely last an hour or will just cut off randomly but the % is on 89 and I‚Äôm sick of it so I was wondering how the pros are.
Hi
You 100% can get new tips now, BTW. <br><br>I‚Äôm literally wearing some.
I wish Apple would have upgraded the Beats X instead.... A little wire but 8 hours on a charge.
Listening to this on my AirPods Pro
my uncle got me these but I have a Samsung s10 is there a sound difference
Does live listening feature work on beats as well? Which ear pods do you use along with your iPhone!
Are these compatible with iPhone 7 plus ?
I asked my friend for his Airpods pro on a plane and when i put them in i thought the bluetooth waves had caused an engine failure because it suddenly was so silent

Sony WF 1000 XM 3 are goated
The Airpods Pro are really a great package. They sound very good, noice cancelling works quiet well (for the size) and they are TOUGH! You can use them at home, when travelling, while running, in the gym‚Ä¶ I had an accident where I left them in my sportswear and they even survived 90 minutes in the washing machine - which is not something you should do to your headphones... That happened one year ago and they still work and sound great. So even though Apple doesn‚Äòt claim they are water resistant - they are.
got the airpods pro. astronomical
These just dont work while working out. You have to keep pressing them in to not lose bass and also to keep the noise actually canceled. If you‚Äôre sweating they literally slide off. Forget about running with touching them every 30 seconds.
Dude I just got them. When I put them in my ears, noise cancellation turned on (which I was not aware of) and I thought my AC turned off. Yes noise cancellation is insane.
Pretty good but the silicone eartips always slip out my ears
lets goooooo marques so proud of you for blowing up I been here since day one you my favorite I wanna meet you I love you marques I&#39;m so glad youtube recommends me marques brownlee
I got severe ear damage from using these. It‚Äôs incredibl‚Äôe that thieves are allowed to sell garbage.
Enjoyed the video and very informative
POV: You clicked on this video because your about to get AirPods Pro or just got AirPods Pro
Thumbnail is oddly disturbing but so creative at the same time.
I recommend soundcore waaaaay better prices, you can change things including volume by just tapping lightly. And it has changeable sizes right out the box. And it has a custom sleep mode where you can add sounds and change the volume in them and much more.
I can still audibly hear my family talking with ANC on even with my music on; I was washing dishes yesterday and heard the plates with my music on full blast. AND THESE JUST CAME IN BRAND-NEW so I sent them back to Apple just in case it‚Äôs a shitty unit
Yoooo where can i buy the exact same case i really like that one brooo but exactly the same cause the most are the back and front open <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=564">9:24</a>
Right on the money my guy üëçüèæ<br>I wanna say if you have an iPhone then AirPod Pros.
Battery life is pretty bad compared to other brands. Typical I suppose.
Do you have any phone case recommendations?
im going to 9th grade in 4 days so my mom ordered me AirPod Pro&#39;s so that i don&#39;t have long and slippery earbuds (regular AirPod&#39;s) so when they fall out they get stolen but witht he pros im safe. ik they still might get stolen but at least they dont fall out
I am about to buy Airpods pro and after watching this, I will definitely get them.
It only gives one thing‚Ä¶ that is comfort
People still can‚Äôt hear me very well when there is background noise from outside. Only down fall.

Just got mine for $60 off at best buy. Pretty great
u can actually replace the eartips. there‚Äôs a lot of options on amazon

Update: apple replacement tips are 7.99
As a person with a (trigger warning) healthy distaste for Apple products, I went ahead and bought these anyway. They&#39;re fenomenal. Here&#39;s my experience.<br><br>Context<br>I have an office job and have Skype/Teams meetings for about 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. I also am a music producer/mixer and have been for 10+ years, so I am familiar with audio devices and sound quality is really important to me. For producing I use the industry standard ATH M50x headphones, but I wanted something smaller, portable, wireless and with a mic for work and casual use on Spotify, Tidal and Youtube. <br><br>Pros:<br>- They have great, seamless connectivity with my non-Apple devices (Samsung Galaxy S10 Edge, HP Envy, Asus Zenbook). Yes, really, they do. Note: to monitor battery life of the AirPod Pros use the MaterialPods app and place the widget somewhere on your phone. It&#39;s a great battery life monitoring dashboard displaying the battery life of each in-ear individually and your case. I was not paid to say this, just a happy user!<br>- The mic is clear and doesn&#39;t pick up much background noise at all in busy places.<br>- The ACN is fenominal. It&#39;s like having a volume control to the world. Very exciting experience and great for focus in any environment. <br>- Sound quality is great for casual music listening. Pleasantly detailed and immerisive sound. At least, when listening to more recently produced music... 60s/70s rock does not sound equally great which is a pity (instruments sound weirdly roomy and far apart, low end is kind of missing). When listening to Jazz from the same timeframe the instuments sounded better, but also a little bit unbalanced, but acceptable. <br>- In-ears are stably positioned and will not fall out when using.<br><br>Cons:<br>- The in-ears get kind of painful for me (although many other people do NOT have this issue). <br>- Price.<br>- Case is laughably scratch sensitive. Look into case protection.<br><br>I also briefly tried out the Sony WF-1000XM3. Sound quality and ACN are very slightly better on the Sonys. However, the mic picked up LOTS of background noise (which killed the deal straight away for me), huge case, less stable fit in your ear, design, and last but not least: less stable connectivity!!!!!!!<br><br>I would recommend the AirPod Pro to anyone really. And no I will not be getting any other Apple merchandise.
Marques nails it in the end. They&#39;re the best for day-to-day use, especially if you&#39;re an iPhone user. The way they blend into the Apple ecosystem and the way it flawlessly &quot;just works&quot; all the time with my iPhone is wonderful. <br><br><br><br>Before I got these, I had a pair of wireless earbuds by Anker for 3 years that worked great. They were 1/4 the price and never gave me anything to really complain about. Sadly, I lost them somehow while on vacation. When I bit the bullet for the Airpods after my friend raved about them for weeks, I finally got what he was on about. The occasional connection problem that made me need to turn bluetooth on and off, the occasional sync problem between left and right... all of that was gone. Those were just minor annoyances that never <b>really</b> bothered me, and I still would be perfectly happy with my Ankers, but I do get the appeal of these things. <br><br><br><br>Noise-canceling works better than I thought it would. The sound quality is satisfying. They sound &quot;bigger&quot; that you would expect. It is not audiophile stuff by any means, but I don&#39;t think most people even want that. They&#39;re great for podcasts, audiobooks, and casual music listening. They really stick great in my ears, better than any other earbud I&#39;ve ever used. The tips aren&#39;t round, they&#39;re oval. It&#39;s a subtle difference that is effective. They are expensive. I picked them up for $199 at a sale, which is the most I&#39;d be willing to pay for them. That&#39;s still quite a bit of money, so if you don&#39;t want to spend this much, look at what Anker has to offer. Their stuff is great, too.

Iv given AirPods Pro a bit of a hard time, especially as far as sound quality goes. And in fairness they‚Äôre not the best sounding earbuds you‚Äôll get for the cost. However since apple has finally upt their game with Apple Music and increased the audio quality I have to say the AirPods Pro are sounding a lot better! Also with iOS 15 beta. You get spatial stereo as well as the spatial on Dolby atmos. This has really improved the sound quality and there‚Äôs a noticeable difference between the sound quality on iOS 14 and beta 15. I‚Äôm really Impressed. There‚Äôs still better sounding buds out there. But the AirPods Pro are certainly worthy of being some of the best. And with their superb integration with the apple ecosystem. Their excellent noise cancellation and seamless flow between iOS devices you simply can‚Äôt get better from an all round perspective. Put it this way they work way better than let‚Äôs say Samsung integration between a s21 ultra, tab s7 plus and their buds pro. They just don‚Äôt work together as well as the iOS devices do. Well done apple.

I will never regret buying these.
Anybody who‚Äôs looking to buy one of these just don‚Äôt. Paying 300 dollars for none existing call quality. It really sucks to not being able to use my AirPods outside because people can‚Äôt hear me every time I try using it people say my voice is muffled. This problem is out there in forums with thousands of replies and apple not responding to it.
Can you do noise canceling without playing music?

I don&#39;t know what I have it with you when it comes to any sort freakin&#39; review on this planet about a tech and you sort of always? seem to kinda nudge those areas of legit warmness which really convinces the user regarding their buy. I mean you&#39;re as branded and reliable and posh as a good company like say Apple or Bentley would be! And you&#39;re an absolute reliable person to get a review from everytime I see your videos. Please keep being so fantabulous and I feel convinced about my Airpods Pro buy, here in 2021! Although I just needed it for good quality handsfree call but seems like I didn&#39;t waste my money :p Cheers bro!

Surprisingly, the Airpods 2 stay in my ear while the Pros fall out. <br>I&#39;ve also had the problem that the Pros cut my ear. Like, the inner microphone scrapes against the inner wall of my ear and leaves a bad callus.<br>Traded them for the sony xm4.

This is another example of the complete put up job that you did with Jaybird&#39;s product. Which was and is awful. This Apple attempt isn&#39;t really that good. It doesn&#39;t sound that good really. Nor does it suppress ambient sound that well. As well, it doesn&#39;t fit most people well enough to be a general use device? This is a poor representation on your part, your conclusion is misleading. They just aren&#39;t worth the money. Period. You should have said that. Really. This is your integrity at stake.

one thing litterly nobody reviewer misses out on with these - the airpods pro really suck in phonecalls outside when its windy.<br>Its even worse than the regular airpods. <br><br>Other than that - i love this pair.
Every time I watch one of your videos I am amazed by the production quality. It&#39;s genuinely fantastic.
I love teh thumbnail
Man I wish I can get a bunch of shit for free
Ok I have these, the Powerbeat pros, and Bose 700. Out of all of them the Bose ones are the best (considering you‚Äôre fine with üéß)
Without rubber wingtips, they fall right out of my ears within a couple of minutes.  Fortunately, you can get them cheap on Amazon. A bit of a pain to apply, but so worth it. Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt close the case without taking the wingtips off. I really wish they were standard like Bose‚Äôs.
What is Sony doing with those names.
Shouldn&#39;t ANC actually make sound a bit worse given how it &quot;kills&quot; the tone of the noise from reaching your ear? If the noise has the same frequency as the mids, for example, then the mids from the music you&#39;re listening to would be slightly dulled. In addition to that, since ANC is using a technique called destructive interference, then that would put more strain on the single driver that these earbuds have. Just my 2 cents.
The questionable save indisputably confess because sack conservatively film after a ten bubble. weary, skillful watchmaker
This is late but they‚Äôre like the jack of all trades of headphones where just a little bit is good at it all but it‚Äôs not perfect
Jack of all trades master if none.!!
Wow Susan.
im glad they got rid of that uncomfortable ass bud shape cause the original airpods for real put scabs in my ears
Great vid but the song choice for the simulator made it sound like the song was the coffee shop
They are the german shepherd of earbuds, not the best at anything but the second best
Hi Marques, I enjoyed your review and I like your approach and how unbiased you are.  I sort of wished you did one more comparison based on pricing versus the Sony pair, but short of that, great job and great reviews!  Thanks!

I have the Powerbeats pro and they‚Äôre trash. They don‚Äôt charge 3/4 of the time and the case is huge in comparison.

jack of all trades, master of none
The noise cancellation works so well that when I first put them into my ears, I thought my car had stalled just sitting there because I no longer heard the engine or the air vents blowing full blast. Gave me a bit of a scare for a few seconds until I realized what it actually was.

To be honest I clicked this because there was a AirPod man/ woman
Love AirPods but once they shortened the stem I rarely bother squeezing them anymore. I‚Äôd rather use my phone to change tracks, hang up, etc. otherwise they tend to become dislodged from my ear. Easily their biggest design flaw
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=81">1:21</a> I think you mean they sound just as bad for phone calls...AirPods microphones are complete trash
AirPods Pro are the best, The size of them is amazing, and still sound great and its a very quality product ;)
A year in with these things and they&#39;re pretty good. Only bad thing is that sometimes they feel like it&#39;s not in your ears and other times it feels like it&#39;s digging into your ears.
Just got these as a gift and now checking these videos lmao, love them ü§©
For me the AirPods 2 is much more louder and has more bass than the AirPods Pro! I‚Äôm so disappointed with this shit!
It is so dramatic

you got a Mag-safe shirt 2 years ago
Am getting mine soon.  I‚Äôve had the first AirPod for 4 yrs so I time for pro ones
So my experience of having them since near enough launch. They are superb, absolutely love them and use them almost everyday. However, I have had to have both the left and right buds replaced by Apple under warranty on the two separate occasions as each one developed a clicking sound. It wasn&#39;t noticeable when sat still or laying, but going for a walk made a click with every footstep. Possibly the silicone cap coming loose from the bud itself, i&#39;m not sure. Both were replaced for free by Apple and I just had to upgrade the new buds firmware, however they are now out of warranty, so if the replacements develop the same issue i&#39;m not sure i could really use them anymore, fingers crossed that they don&#39;t! Otherwise, as I say, fantastic! Spacial audio blows my mind every time, volume controls and track skipping etc from my watch is seamless, phone calls sound good, music sounds great to my non-audiophile ears. I love them. Hope that helps someone.
Excellent review, this really helped me out!üíï
Me when i see someone wearing airpods pro<br>Hey siri max out the volume
Still got mine and they good till this day
I‚Äôve just brought myself a pair and I‚Äôm very impressed with them, they‚Äôre perfect to use for walking to work listening to my music. The noise cancellation is bloody brilliant as it genuinely blocks noises you‚Äôd rather not here, especially for my girlfriend when I‚Äôm snoring away at night!
My experience with these being a delivery driver and needing a headset that works well with the iPhone no headphones can hold a candle to them I only use one at a time with the transparency mode on and it almost feels like the sound is floating outside of my ear if that makes since I can hold a quick conversation with them and be able to hear well the touch features I feel are better because say like pulling your hoodie up won‚Äôt pause them or skip the song and since I only use one on the old air pods I had them both bound to pause for the tap so this makes it I can fully control music or podcasts with one headphone in my opinion if you work with headphones or need a headset to hands free text and make calls quickly while not pulling out your iPhone these will be your best friend but I will say this is a very niche use in my opinion

Sbrigare! Le persone non possono fermarsi (sconto del 20% sull&#39;offerta limitata Apple AirPods Pro)
Hey MKBHD. I love your reviews. Thanks for everything! I have a q about the AirPods Pro. I bought these a couple of days back and loved the iOS integration, however being the ‚ÄúPRO‚Äù version they do not nearly live up to the expectation of the sound quality specially on the low frequencies. I mean I can do with fine bass but it almost sounds like they completely lack it and for my initial impressions that‚Äôs a deal breaker. My question is after using them for over a year now, do you think that the other features absolutely make them still worth it even though they sound completely mediocre specially in the bass department? Would love your perspective as I want to decide wherever to return them or not.
My head feel heavy after wearing them, similar to when an airplane takes off. Doesn‚Äôt happen with the regular ones. Is it just me or someone else feels the same too?

The sound gets muddy at high volume and it isn&#39;t worth the money at all if you&#39;re an audiophile. <br>I&#39;m listening to The Tempest by Pendulum on the AP Pro after listening to it on my Sony WH-100XM3 cans and the comparison is insulting. <br>I can&#39;t wait for my cans to finish charging so I can take these ear condoms off. <br>Don&#39;t buy these unless you get them as a gift like I did.
Does anyone know what skin he‚Äôs using on the iPad Pro?
This review was far better than any other reviews about Airpods. You‚Äôre amazing!

who is watching this after the airpods max came out?
I like the thumbnail pic
I have 2 big points that I want to mention because I do not know if the problem is in all AirPods Pro but in noise reduction modes or the other mode that I have forgot the name there is little noise on the back it&#39;s not really good.. and the second point is for the mic .. in my videos the sound came from the mic of the iPhone and not from the mic of airpods pro ..

Bruh one year later you look dumb if you have the old ones as the pros are a new style
Alright so I have a dilemma. I want the AirPod Pro‚Äôs, but I‚Äôm an Android person for phones. If I get the S20 and the AirPods Pro would that be a good experience? Or should I get an IPhone? Design wise I prefer the S20 over the IP12 but I‚Äôd be alright with getting an IPhone

Had these for a year now and they&#39;re still awesome. They don&#39;t have the best sound quality by any means, yet they still manage to easily be the best earbuds I&#39;ve ever had, and it&#39;s not even close. Also unlike 99% of the welfare trash here, I&#39;ve actually owned a lot of good and expensive earbuds, there are not even in the top 3 of my expensive earbuds, and they&#39;re still by far the best. Only thing I&#39;d hope for is slightly better battery life, but that&#39;s only an issue because they&#39;re so comfortable and I can easily go through 5-straight hours of usage without taking them out of my ear.

I truly don&#39;t like these. I just got them this week and I just don&#39;t get the hype. So far, the only bonus I can see (and the reason why I am keeping them) is because they solve the &quot;can&#39;t charge the iphone and play music at the same time via headphones&quot; issue. I also like that it comes with different sized tips. But the sound quality? Even with noise cancellation? Nope. I have cheaper, wired sony headphones that are almost two years old, and they sound better to me than these. The noise cancelling is okay; it does block out a fair amount of sound depending on the environment. But even after playing with the EQ features, these cannot handle the base my Sony wired-headphones can handle (that cost 200.00 less than these). I gotta be missing something because everyone love these except for me and my sister.

I have AirPods 1 and AirPods Pro (recent purchase). My opinion is the pros are noticeable in your ears üëÇ obviously. The AirPods 1 and 2 are simple light and comfortable to use anywhere/everywhere. They‚Äôre both equally good in terms of sound quality. I think the pros are only better because they push further in your ear canal. If you push the AirPods 1 or 2 deeper in your ear you‚Äôll hear it sounds same as pros.
My pod pros make my ears sore for a while when I first start using them but it doesnt last long. These buds have honestly genuinely changed my life. Ill put them in after a hard day at work and not even listen to anything. Ill just use the noise cancelation to quiet my kid down some to take the edge off and it works fing GREAT!! Ive never had noise cancelation before and its crazy how well it works.

I just bought  Airpods Pro and for the life of me I can&#39;t see what the hype is all about. They sound like crap compared to my Galaxy Buds +.  The only 2 things I like about them is they are comfortable in the ears and ANC.<br>Can&#39;t adjust the volume on the Airpods Pro. That is an unforgivable sin in my book.

Am I the only one that feels like a really obnoxious and arrogant person when I use hey Siri in public
I was annoyed for a minute that I couldn‚Äôt tap to fast forward or pause. But the noise cancellation is great. I work in a refinery and it‚Äôs really loud. I can switch between noise cancellation to transparency when someone is trying to talk to me. You can actually watch a movie in a noisy environment. Couldn‚Äôt do that with the previous AirPods

I can&#39;t get enough of that intro tune, slightly addictive. Who created it?
They are nuts on Bart
Jabra 75t is a better fit, much more reliable, and it always works. Sound quality is better too. The new Jabra 85t has active noise cancellation, but you really don&#39;t need it on the 75t. The buds fit so well that they are like wearing earplugs. The hear through feature might be slightly better on the Air Pods Pro. Still not sure how I feel about that. It&#39;s a toss up.
My Air Pod Pros have charging problems. The left bud discharges at double the rate of the right bud. Maybe more than double. The charging cradle sometimes works on the left ear bud, but not always. Sometimes both buds will charge to 100 percent, and then in the morning the left bud will be dead. I&#39;ve deleted and installed the Air Pod Pros twice, and I have updated the firmware. I&#39;m about ready to return them. Pretty poor build quality. They sound nice when they work. I always carry my Jabras as a spare just in case.
They worked 10 months for me. Then the clicks started but the most annoying things was the buzzing when I speak. Was lucky to return them.

Air pods pro will be perfect for my everyday stuff. I travel 2 hours for work so I can listen to music. Charge it in the case while I&#39;m in the work so battery wont be an issue. Also at home is very noisy so noise cancellation will be amazing. Love that it is small cause I am a guy so that means I carry a lot of stuff in my pocket so small the better.
Achaglby
Jack of all trades, master of none
Caption:confusedly very clear
AirPods owner: Do I smell broke in here?<br><br>AirPods Pro owner:let me turn off my noise cancellation to hear your broke
Thumbnail of the year üèÜ
Sweet vid, get mine tomorrow
Tried the airpods pro and this is the most expensive earbuds with the most lackluster bass. The bass are so halfbaked they should put full bass not a half baked bass by hiding it with treble clarity i will call this a bullshit 250$

who is watching this video with your new earpods pro..
I USE MY APPLE WATCH TO ADJUST THE VOLUME. Ergoüëç
Wait why am I watching this I don‚Äôt have money
I wish I will have that one even if it is fake or real. üòÜ
Why anybody not talking about AirPod pro static sound issue...
Funny that a video about ANC has a constant fan noise in the background.
Friends, order high-quality airpods and True noise reduction airpods pro product links,<br>@t

I‚Äôm starting to like them a lot now<br>If I was patient I would buy them but I have enough for the oThere so
on amazon there is a review for airpods pro that says<br> &quot;Saved my marriage<br>With the new transparency mode, I can listen to music knowing that I will never be ran over by a car on the street again. Another W for Tim Cook and the boys&quot;
Are the silicone tips easily cleanable? Especially for earwax?
im¬∑per¬∑fect¬∑ly<br><br>/imÀàp…ôrf…ôktlƒì/<br><br>adverb<br><br>&quot;in a flawed or incomplete way.&quot;
There is a huge thread in the Apple Discussions about these new tips causing people itchy and infected ears, yet Apple is not even bothering to reply. The tips they use are not the same silicone ones as other brands and are causing people some serious issues, so if you have sensitive ears, think twice before investing in these overpriced health hazards.
Who‚Äôs watching with AirPods
only problem with the seal is that it collects alot of Earwax
I watch this vid with wierd one ‡≤†_‡≤†
AirPods I don‚Äôt want them like AirPods airport üòÜ
The biggest question is though, is it worth the price?
I swear these hurt my ears and u definitely can not lay down in themüò≠üò≠should of went with the bud lives
Great review.  You just nudged me off the fence, I am going to order a pair now.
buds live - ANC for 150 dollars<br>the people - we want ANC AirPods <br>Apple - ok sure but it&#39;ll cost 250 dollars
I find it funny how I‚Äôve watched this 10 times and this is the time watching it where I finally say, if you have airpods, and complain about no volume changer of sorts. Go get an Apple Watch (if you want to obviously), I change the volume to my pods on my Apple Watch 95% of the time even for my phone volume!
Turns out that small pocket that MKBHD never uses is meant for my salary
Who else is watching this video with AirPod pros In their ears
It‚Äôs good . Not worth the money
Anyone using 10 months later? Is it still good? Thinking of buying one.
Should I get Airpods Pro or Jabra Elite 75t?

I liked cos that thumbnail is perfect
The squishy earphones always fall out and now Apple makes them too, noooooooo! üò≠
Very cool,  but not designed for my wallet
There are some problems on AirPods Pro. I bought it on September 2020 here in Nepal. But left side of Airpod continuously producing beep like rattling noise in every 2 seconds. <br>Disappointed with this!
Best thumbnail
Got these for my girlfriend sadly the pair was faulty so got them exchanged today! My gf tells me they are amazing. I can say so as well
It was like magic in my ear lol compared to original airpods. I had to come see what you thought about them too.
Actually i use I watch to change the volume, so that avoids asking for siri all the time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=14">0:14</a> me when i bought 1st generation of some tech and the 2nd generation which is cheaper is announced next day
Why are you reading a script? And what‚Äôs with all these cut outs to clips of you wearing them? We see you wearing them... <br><br>Trying to hide a script for some reason?
I can finally watch this with AirPod pros!
The thumbnail of this video was one of the biggest flex ever.
Thumbnail&#39;s awesome
the thumbnail was adorable, so i clicked
Love the Thumbnail... &lt;3
Dont like the design <br>Gonna stick to air pods 2
Are these worth getting if you have a android an not a iPhone
I must be the only person here who actually likes the way regular airpods fit over the AirPods Pro type silicon tip earbuds. The silicon tip type always fall out of my ears as I can never get a good fit, while the regular airpods have never fallen out of my ears once and are pretty comfortable. Now I wish they could somehow get noise cancelling on the regular versions, maybe in like 5 years they‚Äôll figure that out lol
Me with jailbreak changing the volume üòÇ
should i buy these or anker liberty air 2?
Does this feel like your ears are blocked by just wearing it alone?                                                            Can we use either of the stem as a primary one for calling use?
Who was surprised how he mad there title
Who else ordered their new airpods and watching these reviews on YouTube?<br>Cause i am ü§≠ .
Just got them. They are much better than galaxy buds.
I‚Äôm surprised that they didn‚Äôt make us pay $100 for the silicon tips aloneü§£
My friend let me try his pros today, I ran away with them, watching this video with those .<br><br>Thanks bro
I love the thumbnail and i honestly clicked this video just to say this
They are so good i wear them every day and if i need to listen just set noise canceling off and listen without taking them out off mi ear so nice
Mkbhd <br><br>Give me your air pords üòÖ‚ù§Ô∏è
Does it auto connect to an Android phone when the case opens or bud removed?
how did you get the long stitch scar on your hand???
I usually find myself adjusting the volume with my üçéwatch
Anyone else find it funny when people complain about microphones? Like I‚Äôm buying headphones for me, I don‚Äôt care if people think my phone calls suck.
Cover your right ear the volume goes up. <br>Cover your left ear the volume goes down. <br><br>The microphones could tell when the ears are covered and this could be a simple update to allow for volume control.
I don&#39;t care evn if I don&#39;t like the video but I will like it for sure because of the thumbnail
Dose it fall out with small ears
X √Ü A-12 got these built in üò≥
Thumbnail is sick
People with AirBods are broke cuz they can&#39;t afford wires
Imagine hearing AirPod Pro simulator in a AirPod Pro!
Waiting for your galaxy live buds review as I‚Äôm using S10 and they appeal more in terms of comfort which I need for my 10 hr day on calls
Sony CEO: Ok, we need a name for our new headphones, YOU, what should we name them.<br><br>Some dude‚Äôs baby: (blabbering)<br><br>Sony CEO: (whispering under his breath) PERFECT
The little vent on the left of mine got dinged up so now it looks weird but they still work great, nice design from apple i must say
I just upgraded to AirPods Pro from airpods 2 and the difference is incredible
I don‚Äôt understand how not being able to control volume by touching the AirPods is an issue. Like how about you take your phone out your pocket and turn it down lmao
I wish these came with a charge plug.
Yo would be hella nice if you&#39;d make a video about the Sennheiser momentum true wireless 2 and perhaps compare it to the airpods pro.
Imperfectly perfect? It is a LIE . The recording and receiving my voice on my air pods pro is terrible.
Got these and they keep on falling out.
You could volume control just go to the place where you rename it
I am getting pods pro on my bday. Is it worth it
Watching the review of airpods pro after getting em, shashka bro!!
really enjoying the way you made the review. great content!
Buying these tomorrow :)
Who else is watching this with AirPods Pro
The &quot;tiny pocket no one uses&quot; test should be standard for all electronics
I remember when people made fun of it lol
I can wear regular airpods but can&#39;t wear in ear headphones does anyone know if these might fit i have small ears
&quot;Can you change them with foam tips&quot; YES! You can buy different tips now.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=97">1:37</a> anyone know what that scar on his hand is?

Sony what??? That‚Äôs a mouthful!

How many features do you want?<br>Apple: yes
Airpods Owner (me in the past): sorry i can‚Äôt hear broke<br>Airpods Pro Owner (me in the future): what did you say? Can‚Äôt hear you.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=394">6:34</a> We still remember you buddy
All of u just buy Honor Choice wireless earphone it was good

I have all the features on my android. There are apps for that
hi bro please can iget an iphone please please dm me at instagram my id is @ahsan.khan_1050
Is no one going to notice the thumbnail that was a masterpiece
That thumbnail tho...
Can you fall a sleep with them in? I want to listen to stuff on my ipad and fall a sleep :)
Does the noise cancelation and pass through feature work on a samsung / android device? I hate iPhones,  but I like the Air Pod Pros, especially since I am on my 8th pair of galaxy buds. Complete trash. Warranty is alright since they send me new pairs, but 4 months is the longest a pair has lasted. 2 days is ths least.
So is the AirPods is great?<br><br>Mkbhd : yesn&#39;t
the thumbnail is a flex
Glad I have an Apple Watch for volume control. More natural I feel then putting my hand up by my face to change volume
What happened to your right hand if you dont mind me asking
Yes air pods pro are great
I like that thumbnail lol
Can&#39;t wait to get mine tommorow.
I hate that they keep falling off my ear smh. I tried 3 sizes and they fall after a while
Noise doesn&#39;t feel like noise in your simulator broüòÇ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=422">7:02</a> <br>This sold me for the Airpods Pro.

The ‚ÄúG‚Äù in AirPods is for good
I‚Äôd be afraid the tips will get stuck in my ears
So is it Worth getting airpods if you dont own a iPhone

Meanwhile watching this on my airpods pro. Lol the ones that i bought 10min ago from facebook marketplace and came to know they were replacedüòÇ

I both agree and disagree about the noise cancellation sounding better. I find it depends on how much noise it&#39;s trying to cancel out. So for example, if you&#39;re on a bike with a lot of wind, I tend to notice that the bass gets awfully muddy. In most scenario&#39;s it works great, but if you really pay attention you can hear the bass sacrifice when it&#39;s trying to cancel out the bassy frequencies.<br><br>I find they sound best in &#39;Off&#39; mode, or with Noise Cancellation on in a steady environment (Like you mentioned, a coffee shop, busy street, or an airplane)<br><br>But wind definitely isn&#39;t Noise Cancelations friend on these
I was all in until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=460">7:40</a> üòÇüòÖ
I really like your reviews! They helped me settle on the AirPods Pro for my new wireless earbuds. Something that I‚Äôve read from reviews (although isn‚Äôt always mentioned) is that the stem design on the AirPods makes them better for phone calls. I was highly considering the Sony earbuds with the confusingly long name, but I‚Äôve read that the lack of stem means the earbuds get a lot of interference when youre trying to have a phone call somewhere other than a quiet indoor space. I would love earbuds with the type of sound fidelity that the sony ones seem to have, but if it can‚Äôt work well for one of the uses that are really important to me i.e. phone calls, then I can‚Äôt justify spending the money on it! I would love to hear more details in future reviews on testing how earbuds work for phone calls in different environments, too. Thanks again!
Normal people : wow best earbuds blabblanbla<br><br>Me : AirPods man epic, 10 / 10
I like this guy, he‚Äôs straight up.
Who else is watching this with wired earphones?
A small thing I always enjoy about Marques&#39; videos: the framing of the close-up shots is always good. For example, at the @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=134">2:14</a> mark there is a cool looking Apple Park model top left, some colorful Apple product cards bottom right, and an iPhone 3G(???) at the bottom left. There is a lot small details in his videos that make them very enjoyable to watch.
No volume control would be a huge deal breaker for me and tbh I&#39;d rather be fully aware of my surroundings when listening to music podcast etc. So therefore I have massively enjoyed my shiny new Google pixel BUDS still
You can squeeze the side to play or pause. Double squeeze to skip forward. Triple squeeze to skip back and squeeze and hold to activate noise cancellation
Got them. Love them
no you can get 3rd party tips, there are plenty on the market but they don‚Äôt fit or feel as well as the original given ones
thanks bro
How loudly can you safely turn these AirPods Pros to without damaging them?
I think its the most precious stickman ever lmao
Comply makes foam tips for the pros
I was peeing in the forest and dropped my AirPods and didn‚Äôt realize I lost it until I came home
I just use my Apple Watch to turn down my volume ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Nice nubnail lmao
I just bought a MacBook Air + the AirPods Pro with the education offer!! it came to about $1100. That‚Äôs a deal especially for two apple products brand new
Another episode of rich black man
AirPod pros are really a waste of money I got this but really there no better than the cheap ones
Why no Jabras reviewed??
dude I&#39;m gonna buy airpods pro but I wanna know is <br>sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 2 better or airpods pro is better ??
I like your video‚Äôs üëçüèº
LMAO i found those airpods pro between the grass in some field im so lucky
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=163">2:43</a> as you were saying that my AirPods 2 fell out of my ear
The best way to use these are to use one at a time whilst the other charges. Practically the unlimited battery until the case dies!!!! Also, didn‚Äôt realise that my old AirPods 1 are now limited and og!!
Why am I still watching this when I already have them?
I had 15‚Ç¨ fake airpods and they fell ino my coffe and the survived
I keep mine in that same pocket :3
Can someone tell me what the intro music is ???
The most creative thumbnail ever

Listening to this from my AirPods Pro!
I‚Äôm selling some Brand new AirPods Pro respond if you are interested
Hey men, so i buy the airpodspro, put on the anc and i can hear a dog barking 15 mts away, that means my airpods are not working? Or this is the anc? Can u help me?
Did anyone notice the og iphone in baground üßê
You put your airpods in that tiny pocket.....i put my salary üòê
Just got my first pair Monday. Thanks for the vids. P.S. - like the shirt! Got the same one on my visit there in November. Your channel is awesome!
Somebody out there: Omg I‚Äôm going with Powerbeats pro!! Screw Apple! <br><br>Me: uhm Apple owns and makes beats headphones..
I have Apple‚Äôs AirPods Pro and the case has it‚Äôs own battery so you don‚Äôt have to plug the case in to charge the AirPods Pro.and it‚Äôs the same with the old Apple AirPods from the first generation of Apple AirPods to AirPods Pro and i know that because I have the first generation Apple AirPods but they quit working so i have AirPods Pro because of my old AirPods not working anymore
Condom pocket for a win
The data graphs show apple having better noise canceling than the sony.. i was suprised too but just bought then for specificlaly that purpose
Airpods pro are more expensive than my better over ear headphones. And also the stalk thing is ugly as sin and always will be
I liked the thumbnail btwü§ü
That thumbnail deserves an award!
The title was Imperfectly Perfect
Think I‚Äôm bout to cop.
The intro audio In This video makes me revisit it every time
OMG THAT AIRPODS MAN IN THE THUMBNAIL WAS SO CUTE OMG OMG OMG!!!!
I almost decided not to have this! The &#39;imperfectly perfect&#39; phrase got me!hahahaha! Sooooo..im going to get this on my birthday!üéÅ
use ur watch to change the volume
My boiros earphones which I rate is 5/5 because it‚Äôs waterproof, and it is good sound and it takes 2 seconds to pause by clicking on 1 earphone and if I click it for 5 seconds it can activate Siri and if you have an iPhone you can spy using hearing mode and it‚Äôs for $30 on amazon.
Anyone else here think the regular AirPods fit perfectly in their ears?
AirPods Pro are the Gullit of headphones (Fifa players will get me)
The airpods 2 are ‚Ç¨140,- in the Netherlands compared to the Airpods pro‚Äôs that are ‚Ç¨214,- are the airpods pro still worth the bigger price or not? Would appreciate it alot if someone could give me advice
They‚Äôre not Great for anything but there great for everything, I see.
am i the only one who has the hard plastic ones fit better in their ear than silicon tips?
Nice Thumbnail
I dint even have airpods
On android use the App Assistant Trigger that enable all and more functionalities of airpods
I bought the AirPods 2 about 3 weeks ago and they hurt my ears after 1 hour of wearing them so I‚Äôd decide to give the AirPods to my brother and I got myself the pros best  decision  I‚Äôve made ! Should of gotten them the first time !  They don‚Äôt hurt my ears üëÇ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=149">2:29</a> The tiny pocket you never use. Women all over the world stunned.

Black reviewrs suck
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=460">7:40</a>
Just what i needed, i was about to buy  these.
The volume is just a way for apple to want you to buy the watch so you can do it that way
They&#39;re uncomfortable
Re.
Im sorry but did you make an airpods dude<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Its adowable &gt;‚Ä¢&lt;
Loveee that intro with the camera
I wager the &quot;on&quot; mode thing was just a small mixup. Realising it actually says &quot;off&quot; causes it to make so much more sense.
I literally bought these and now I&#39;m watching the review smh... Whatever, they&#39;re amazing!!!
If you have a iWatch. Just use the crown on the watch to up or down. Its pretty neat with small volume control increment. Its better than touch control IMO. Another thing why it feels better in the ear than other ear buds is because the ear tips is oval shape. Think Apple study human ear canal is not totally round but oval. That explain why I feel better with this compare to all the rest of the rounded tips ear buds I have as some part of the rounded tips is exerting more pressure on the ear canal surface than other part which makes you feel uncomfortable at times.

Does active noise canceling work without music ?
I love your intro
Does marques really workout  or does he have a gym in the studio just to test earphones....ü§î
The squaseing see anoyoing.
Great review! I&#39;ve been trying them out for two weeks now. So far the ANC is incredible. Unfortunately, they fall out of my ears every time I smile or chew food! I&#39;ve tried all three tips. Planning to order some memory foam tips and wings which I&#39;ve heard help. It&#39;s sad to have to buy accessories for a $250 pair of earbuds though, just to make them fit right. With that said, they do sound great and I love how well they integrate into iOS on the iPhone. Overall, worth getting-IF I can get them to stay in my ears better. -Griptioneer Dan
Same dude don‚Äôt wanna ask siri too change volume can‚Äôt carry my massive iPhone everywhere
Jabra elite 65t does all this and more I highly rec!
lol<br>&#39;Is that a word? well that&#39;s gonna be the title&#39;.
me: <b>buys sony over-ear ANC headphones that cost the same price as airpods pro</b><br>marques: &quot;They&#39;re not audiophile-great headphones..&quot;<br>*me who wanted to try out the pros cuz the regular airpods are shit*: &quot;damn, nvm then&quot;<br>I want to give them a shot but for that price and that quality.. nahhhh :/
When I saw the pic scrolling though YouTube I laughed so hard
Volume control isn‚Äôt too big an issue, you‚Äôve got the Apple Watch my dude! When I‚Äôm out walking or going for runs and need a quick volume toggle, just use the crown on the watch. :)
Whose watching this with airpods??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8PXdTlDag&amp;t=346">05:46</a> Off mode. <br>We get the gist, just wanted to point it out that the &quot;Off&quot; mode can conserve battery. If it was On, battery conserving wouldn&#39;t be a thing in my opinion.
These Cost more <br>then My phone
Lol 250? I got it for 140 :)
They don‚Äôt sound any better with ANC on. That‚Äôs a placebo because outside noise is cancelled you noob.
Youtuber with 10M+ subs yet didn‚Äôt do a mic test.
I love you so much MKBHD that I wish I could hug you ü§ó
When are we getting a galaxy buds review ?
You didn‚Äôt do a mic test.
Am I the only one that I like that first and second gen AirPods design more than the pro
AirPod user: I can‚Äôt hear broke<br><br>AirPod pro user: I can‚Äôt hear

The AirPods pro are great at everything, but isn‚Äôt amazing at anything. EZ ‚ù§Ô∏è
AirPod pros are just a jack of all trades head phones it good at everything but not the best
Honestly a really really good review channel
You can even pick up calls using double tap<br>But apple don‚Äôt want you to know this because you should buy the watch to do the sameüßê
Please make your vault hoodies available. Ready to drop some major $$$
