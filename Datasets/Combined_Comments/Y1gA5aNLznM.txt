‚ÄúHeyyyyy, who switched the missile and tactical flare buttons?‚Ä¶.‚Äù
they&#39;re lucky the most common variant of S8 is heat and not HE-Frag
Russian army - 3rd best in Ukraine, they say! Intelligent lads!

Putin wanted a reporter dead and so this accidentally happened
Holy shit!!
Comrade Colonel......our 80mm rockets work quite well!

Sloppy pilot
Remember, no press
&quot;Accidentally.&quot;<br><br>surejan.gif
Itchy trigger finger
RiP...
If I was rich enough, I would totally buy this thing. <br><br>Glad no one was seriously injured, from what I heard it was an issue with the fire control system. <br><br>Maybe it‚Äôs a bad idea to fully arm an attack helicopter for training.<br><br>Still this is a badass heli!
Russian propaganda is like German propaganda: efficient, strong and still alive.
Itchy fingers don&#39;t they...... Jesus Christ!!!
The slow motion ruined the whole video, well done
fingerslip
Russian super weapons at work lol

this is fake.
–£–†–° –°-8–ê–° automatically become on the combat platoon when approaching the target, there was a failure in the avionics KA-52 and the guidance system captured the target and launched on the nearest (coincident on the signature) target.<br>Nurses were &quot;inert&quot;, i.e. without an explosive, so that the flame (rocket engine) without explosion and debris (up to 2 thousand ready-made damage elements).<br>Because of such cases and not only two wounded and one damaged &quot;Kamaz&quot; happens ...
In soviet russia, the rockets fire you!
Who said it was an accident?
The scene looks strange and It might be wrong to blame the pilot for this if it&#39;s true, relating that at this altitude and airspeed he couldn&#39;t be aware of that weird situation early enough and following given coordinates and practice orders blind, accepting the thermal device shows up some heated western-murican-not rush b-shooting-dummies. <br><br>Shit happens every time. Youtube give us an short insight of daily madness if you play with guns and the army is the most common place for it, like US and Russia have proven it over and over - it&#39;s not even more different in a small army like in germany. Is there any official statement/confirmation about this incident or some details about the people staying around in the middle of a practice area?
They was on target . 500m before the launch. Pilot switch &quot;fire&quot; socket On. But secondary fire button was slipped...  so, authomatic system find a target  with closest parameters to battle task and made a launch. Rocets was without warheads. So, only minor damages of military van KAMAZ, and few light injuries of 3 persons
Pretty sure that helicopter was firing at a target wrong place at the wrong time.
