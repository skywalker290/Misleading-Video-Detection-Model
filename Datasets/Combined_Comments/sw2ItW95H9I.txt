Wrong bobby diol kissing seens  taneesha mukarji and shakalaka boom movie actress on screen 😮
Among all of them i have only seen Salman Khan, Shilpa Shetty, Asin, Sonakshi Sinha &amp; Tamannah Bhatia have not done any kissing scenes in any movie.
Most of these are nepo products or influential people .. agreed, they do have talent but the privilege to make decisions and get work is still based on above mentioned facts .. others still have to wait for it or has to go with the flow
Salman khan did in radhe movie
Amazing video .thank you for this informations
Good person👍👍
It&#39;s good that they respect each others company costars and coactors privacy and personal life❤
Ta man na bhatia kiss in other film I look his flim
stars who hates kissing but still give best scene fuc....ass...les 😂
Dadu kaise ki ki karega pagal
Sab ne kiya h kiss salman khan, sonakshi, ritesh deshmukh ko chhodkr
Why is it an issue lip locking in Bollywood? If Indian film industry does not support doesn&#39;t  mean you should deny us kissing scenes, mind you, you don&#39;t make films for India only but the world at large unless you say Indian real couples don&#39;t kiss during intimacy. So please act according to real life and include the dame kissing on screen scenes stop pretending guys, BIGUPS to the likes of Alia bhatt, Randeep hooda, Ajay devgan and others who show it all on screen.
Lie on Ajay Devgan
big fan salman khan <br>all are kissing on screen but salman khan never do this inshAllah ❤❤
If its true, i like salman even more...
You are gone mad this are actors who love kissing
When they all do kissing in on screen they not fell bad
Shahrukh really hate kissing <br>But other actors ....I don&#39;t know🤪.<br>SRK really hates kissing but director forced to kiss with Katrina and Anushka .it is real truth
Isemein Sara Ali Khan nahin hai sali video chalu hone ke liye kuch bhi dhukate hai
But ajay devgan had kissed
Lol wrong abt ajay he had akready kissed one movie shivaay, ajay directed that movie 1minute of liplock, aash kissed vivek one movie, srk in zero, why u need  to include pak acters

Ishwarya rai and hruthik roshan kiss scene in dhoom 2
Alia Bhatt had a kissing scene in the student of the year, Raazi, gully boy, Kapoor, and sons. How can show her pic
Looks like earlier actors/actresses refuse kissing on screen. But the new generation ones who hardly know how to act are very expert doing kissing scenes. Very good upbringing by their parents!!! The exception to this new generation actors are people like karishma and kareena kapoor who will both do anything for money. And of cos not forgetting that Bhatt family involving both Pooja and Alia Bhatt. Again very nice upbringing by their parents. If only HIV could be transmitted through kissing I bet nobody will want to do kissing scenes.
Salman khan is the best person 💞
No kissing onscreen is a good policy
You idiot even Tiger shroff hates kissing scenes but he do that to keep on to his character... you missed many actors and actresses, especially Tiger Shroff
Yo srk kissed in jab harry met sajal and zero
Also Kajol ❤️☺️ because we barely (almost never) saw her kissing, but yeah she has romantic scenes

No tammanah kissed in tollywood
It is wrong shilpa shetty kissed in many films
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw2ItW95H9I&amp;t=239">3:59</a> how&#39;s that possible..fawad kissed Sonam in khoobsurat and I think he also kissed Alia in Kapoor and sons
Emraan Hashmi

Agar sare Actors hi mana krenge bold or kissing scene k liye to directer ko film banani hogi to uske bina b bana hi lenge <br>Sahi ki nahi..?
Or samaj me bura asar b nahi padta
Agar actors or actresses hi bold scene krne k liye mana karde to bhi film chal sakti he
Why you have put thumbnail of tiger,alia and Sara.
The all had kissing scene without salman!😶😶
SRK did kiss on jab Harry met sejal

If some one think  that openly kissing is ok then what is the harm in openly pissing or shiting &amp;  ___king there is a main difference  between animal &amp; Humen , senceless animal have no sence of privacy  but a human is a sencible animal human has few things which they don&#39;t  shair to every one or anyone ,kissing   ,making love , going to toilet , changing dresses  are all private affairs. No matter u believe in any religion, God  or not  every one has the sence of privacy  and shame so performing  every thing openly is not wisdom keep all private  activities to one  person at a time
Wrong list <br><br>It should only be salman
Alia bhatt is notin the video but u placed her picture there
Bobby and salman
Bhosadichya shivvay madhe tujya aai la kiss kelela ka
Where is katrina,  kareena and sharddha kapoor this three actresses are expert in kissing on screen....😂😃😄😂😄

Why you mentioned Fawad Khan? As far as I know he did kissing scenes in the movie &#39;Khoobsurat&#39; !
Fawad is in Lollywood
No kissing policy is good because sometimes girls don&#39;t want to kiss
I agree to them  keep it  up thats culture and tradition  respect  guys
But in Bahubali Tamanaa kiss bahubali son😂
Salman is real
Srk kisses kajols necked in K3G
I only open this video for Sara because I saw her picture
Fawad Khan kissed Alia Bhatt in Kapoor and son’s and he also kissed Sonam Kapoor in Koobsurat
All wrong information
Sali Tiger ki photo deke view barate hoo😡😡
Sk
Fawad khan kiss two in khbsoorat movie
Fawad khan kissed sonam kapoor in “khubsurat&quot;
It&#39;s good that they dont kiss.. One can watch porn movies if they want to get erotic. We watch Bollywood movies for entertainment.. It really becomes uncomfortable when we are with family and such scene comes. Even a comedy movie nowadays is risk to go watch with family, one never knows kab aisa koi scene aa jaye. There are many films which are loved by audience and super super hit without having such scenes
Fawad khan done kissing seen with alia bhatt in Kapor and Sons movie okk
Shilpa shetty is in most of the videos of hers 😂🤷‍♀️.
Josh film Mai ash nay kiss Kya tha
Only slman khan
Sonakshi Sinha Has Done Kissing With Ranveer
i was a big fan of indian film but now I hate Indian film because of the bad things that they are make and it is very dangerous to watch it with children or family and very bad for Muslim to see  some indian film now old film are very interesting to see than films now.
I&#39;m also apart of this video I&#39;m proud of them who hate kissing screens
Baler news...sala view pawar jonno jotosob dhyamna pona....
I think except salman khan everyone had the kissing scene. Y did u include aishwarya and shilpa&#39;s  name in this video they had done kissing scenes many times
I like alia bhatt very much
Yes..ajay devgan&#39;s kiss ileana d cruz
hypocrisy, behind doors they cheat on their partners even foreplay on sex. religion does not allow sex before marriage, but they do so. but kissing looks a big sin or crime above all this. I call it hypocrisy, and you??????
Really?? They put aishwarya rai here!!!!
Only Salman Khan real I never seen him kissing onscreen
It’s their choice and we should respect it.
After watching srk, Ajay &amp; Aishwarya name I was starting think to that they&#39;re gonna put Imran hasmi in this list too
Only SK is real😍
Alia..and don&#39;t like kissing..🤣🤣🤣🤣..BULSHIT
They earned my respect
Baki kato pata nahin par Ali Zafar kato Love you zindagi me dekha hai kiss karte hua ........
