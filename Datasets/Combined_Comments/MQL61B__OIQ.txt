This is called the gyroscopic effect, a bike in motion stays upright which make us bikers&#39; lives much easier. And because that Harley has a very high torque the engine even at idle keeps the bike going - unless the rider used the throttle thumb screw as cruise control. I wonder how he came off though... Silly stunt gone wrong maybe.
Seems like the bike wants to drive by its own casue it annoyed by the driver

That&#39;s some great balance.
There is no mystery the rider fell off and the bike keeps going until a crushes.  That&#39;s why they don&#39;t show you how it crushed. Because that will take away the mystery 😂
And then crashed... 😂
