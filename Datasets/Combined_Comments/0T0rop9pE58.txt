Who is using it in 2024
we can&#39;t buy also it in 2024<br>Waiting for 2025
bro ias wearing illuminati stuff
Who is using note 10 plus in 2024?
Hardest intro ever
Wtffff look at his fucking shirt
Best looking phone ever
I&#39;m using mine now in 2024.
Galaxy s11 doesn’t exist and also a s12 or s13 or s14 or s15 or s16 or s17 or s18 or even s19 doesn’t exist too lol
This looks like the s23 ultra
What happens to the phones after you get through reviewing them ? 😁
One my favorite MKBHD intros ❤😊😊
I&#39;m here just to say that I&#39;m still using my note 10+ which I bought in November 2019 and it&#39;s still working as day 1, and the battery life is impressively almost as day 1 🙌
Just got my note 10 plus 😅..... and am right here watching the review 🎉....
I’m thinking of buying a second hand one and really happy to see a group of people using this phone even after 4 years it is released and is rocking fine. 💜
Assurant is going to send me this phone to replace my recently cracked Note 8. Seems like a big upgrade though the OS is likely to be dated. Only paid $99 for the deductible so I guess it’s not too bad.
I love how people thought that there would be a note 11
Take off your cariminati shirt
Does it have Dex???
who watch this video in 2023😢
Who wanted to okay
S24 ultra should have same back panel. It looks awsome.
seeing you getting so excited for 45 watt fast charging in 2023 is really something
That Illuminati Tee though! ;)
I wish they brought this back in 2023 but revamped in every angle
i have personal beef with the note 10+ because I got the s10+ RIGHt before it came out not knowing about it existing and the note is leagues better
Watching this again on my S22 Ultra and gotta say, if I still had a note 10+ I&#39;d still keep it. Nothing much has changed in my opinion (except the camera quality).
I have an s21 ultra but still want the n10+... Lol
Hi good morning to iam munir franjieh from Lebanon 🇱🇧 I have note 10 plus its fantastic mobile thanks for putting this video bye fro munir franjieh bye
4年経った今でも世界一綺麗なスマホ<br>s23ultra使ってるけどiphoneみたいな無難な色ばっかでデザインいまいち。このオーラグローみたいな色が恋しい😢
Fucking bulletproof.  Best Sammy ever
Her King
can you add external memory to the note 10?  I just ordered a replacement note 9 for my failing note 9 which i think is due to the home UI one app you mentioned
All these pretty gadgets now I understand why people get addicted to these things
What am I doing here 3 years later and I use a 300$ smartphone 😭
I love the phone so much.  If am in a position of financial stability right now I will buy it straight away.
Where to get that wallpaper??
Watching from my note 10+. Absolutely love it, its really big and the video stability is awesome
Man this color looks so good its unbelievable they didnt rerelease a phone with that color.
this man always criticise samsung even how great samsung phones is i think he need to stop review samsung and only work for shit apple
The design is no different than Sony Xperia models that you hate but you like this design for Samsung 😅
I thought note 10 plus has a 120hz refresh rate option. Under settings, display, and smoothness. Check it.
iluminati tshirt !!!
not 10+ How mach
Samsung Note was known at three Phablet
Always give us option of headphone plug or Bluetooth/Wi-Fi!
Appeared out of nowhere in Mid 2023....
Rocking my note 10 plus... same color
I&#39;ll do anything (legal) for a new phone my current phone is bad. I&#39;m a Samsung and MKBHD die hard fan🥺🥰
What&#39;s that on his T shirt?
Who is using note 10 plus in 2023?
I&#39;ve been using note 5 for 6 years &amp; this month it stops functioning so I bought an A53 5G just to change my mind but quickly regrets it &amp; now I&#39;m going back to note range...your video helped me finalize my decision to get a note 10+ &amp; I already book one...yeah I wasted quite an amount of money where shoul&#39;ve just straight away bought the note 10+ but I bought the A series (which I&#39;m not fond of 😢)...finallyI&#39;m I&#39;m back to note series 😅
Still, can’t afford this😂
Watching this on my Note 10+ in 2023. This phone never dies.
Yes this is the best designed phone ever.
I&#39;m here appreciating how far we come &quot;s23 ultra&quot; from this beast of a phone only 3 years ago now
The design of the new devices has gotten quite stale ever since about the Note 9. They&#39;ve all sort of decided to go for the subdued colors rather than looking like this. Don&#39;t know why but I prefer having some more eclectic color variants with my device
Still my favorite design
Watching this in 2023. Didn&#39;t realize MB was the one who bullied all the phone makers into going 120hz, lol.
This guys just talks alot, he doesn&#39;t review phones like other YouTubers... and no one uses a wired headphone anymore,  so the jack isn&#39;t necessary you
Why that shirt ?
$200-300 for this phone (256GB) in 2023 is a steal.
Still rocking this phone in 2023!
Wow. Remembering when the Note was something special than ultra’s unneeded sibling.😂
Me watching in 2023<br>And I find it wierd him saying S11
Finally got mine today
How Funny, Samsung had 45 watt charging support in 2019,it is 2023 and they still have 45 watts(which is almost same as 25 watts), where as other companies have gone 200+ watts already.
Put a fucking case on your phone
Hearing you say S11 now just sounds ..........
I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ and when I&#39;m connected to wifi, the speed test shows half the speed I have. Whereas when I connect to my laptop (I connect via WiFi and I know that the laptop has better reception), I have a declared speed of 50 mb.<br> <br>On the Huawei P40 pro I had no problem with that, even when I use mobile internet, on the Huawei P40 PRO I had better reception and much better mobile internet, while whenever I use a Samsung mobile device the speed is lower and I have problems with mobile signal reception, less is than on the Huawei P40 Pro.
Is this phone still viable in 2022?
Can I still buy a note 10 plus..........hope to use for the next 2 years? Am on a budget but I love the design is there anything other you will suggest???
The galaxy s11 💀
Hi can someone please tell me what&#39;s the full name of the intro song ?
Best design ever best performance...best camera  love it
what is with the T-shirt man, are you👺👺?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=678">11:18</a>
I&#39;m watching this on my Note 20+ in October 2022....nice
Bro wearing a triangle and eye randomly just like that
45w is insane for a phone?<br><br>Oppo: hold my bear
Yes, yes, yes, when a  phone is more than a down payment on a car, then nit picking isn&#39;t just justifiable, it should be expected. If I&#39;m paying more than $1000 then I want everything. Also I fell in love with the S-pen when I forgot to bring a pen and paper to a meeting. I was like 😃 wait this is the whole point of my note phone. Took out the S-pen started taking notes.
Cannot lie thats a beautiful phone the note series is my dream phone
Is this device really water resistant guys?I put mine in water but i quickly switched it off cz if the screen which was changing its colour
My oraimo 27000 mah power bank can&#39;t charge my Samsung galaxy note 10 plus phone. Please help 🙏
New phones used to bring more not less. Boo !
Is headphone jack useful
Dude they didn&#39;t do the high refresh rate for one simple reason.<br>It would have compelled the redesign of the entire chassis: To accommodate a bigger battery cause a 120hz refresh rate would eat the existing battery up.<br>Hey Playa don&#39;t be a hata..<br><br>Check this vibe.  2022.  Picked up this phone new;<br>For under $400.00<br>I&#39;d have to say that makes it the finest mid-range phone of the year😲
S11?
should i buy this later?
What’s the name of the intro song??
Galaxy S11...
Yeah, I think they should bring back the headphone jack, a lot of people miss it
Helpus PLeasus!<br>I got this phone in 2019 november somewhere and still love it.<br>But now its been hacked via Whatsapp.<br>If I now go for another Note 10+, chances are that they will sell me a refurbishes piece.<br>A Note 22 ULTRA is a bit too heavy for me at this moment.<br>What can I do Mr. Marques and fans?
Checking in 2 years later and I still am in love with my note 10 plus. Only thing is I wish I would of gotten the 5g model
What about the battery
Glad you showed One Plus 7 Pro. I was using it for more than 2 years, and was just thinking about getting a Note 10+ 5G variant as an upgrade. It is available for ~$400, and seems like a great deal!
Huawei: atleast I have color&#39;s.<br><br><br>Samsung: Hold on!!
No headphone Jack ‘?
Forgive my stupidity, but I forget, is the note 10 plus  5g? Or just 4g?
The one major thing I found out is that this phone over heats so I returned it thats just after half and hours use
As for the headphone jack, I just got a $9 3 inch dongle at best buy, USB mini to 3 5 mm.
Got mine in blue back. Most amazing phone I&#39;ve ever had
Note11😐 Who&#39;s gonna tell him?
in 2022 this is a must phone only $350 right now on ebay and the specs are still great
I love my Pixel 4xl, A Lot. But I am quite excited to try out my new Note 10 Plus as my secondary!
Why did Samsung get rid of the headphone Jack because it was iconic <br>You would of thought that with a high price tag you would be getting a high quality product <br>And that notch in the middle it makes it unattractive <br>I have owned my note 8 for 5 years and it still works great like the day I got it on contract
Always wanted a note phone. Wanted to upgrade from my one plus 7t. But can&#39;t afford the latest. So I was consider the note 10 plus but I CANNOT go back to 60hz .my god I&#39;m so upset.
Did you say S11??   Well, that sh*t didnt happen...sorry
Coming back and hearing S11 makes me think Samsung got us all back then.
Zoom in zoom out zoom in zoom out zoom in zoom out
I found a couple month this gorgeous wallpaper... But I lost it in my 2To  Google picture... Someone can help me
I bought this phone in 2020 January and I am still using it up to date. It&#39;s a very good phone 👍
I got an S22 Ultra now and it immediately reminded me of the Note 10+ I was using before this.
Still using mine in 2022 and it&#39;s still holding ip really well compared to the phones around me
Just turn transitions off. Boom, no slow FPS feel.
I JUST BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR $400 HASN&#39;T ARRIVED YET HOW LONG GOES GAMING NORMALLY LAST ?
Dose the note + have a single tap to answer a call.
Watching it on mynote 10 plus in 2022 since most flagships have same design
Note 10 plus.$$$
I can get this now for $300 is it worth it ? For an upgrade from a galaxy S9+
Is this a good upgrade from the galaxy S9+?
Still the best Galaxy.
Watching this in 2022 and it&#39;s still a great phone
there is no point if you&#39;re famouse buy selling your soul i pray that God saves your soul.
Illuminati shirt? Ok
Nice
to me the fingerprint is fast 😭 because the finger print I have on my phone doesn’t work haha so I have to type in the password every time
did anyone see whats on marques&#39; t shirt
Still better than samsung note 20 not ultra
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=655">10:55</a> which app is this?
someone said S ELEVEN
Wow
S22 Ultra is exactly like this phone except somewhat decent camera rings.
It has wireless DEX now.... Nice!
Lol 120hrtz... most people don&#39;t even know what it means without noticing it.
Hi Marques, I subscribe to and watch a fair amount of your YouTube videos on phone tech. I&#39;m not very &quot;techy&quot; at all, but I have a Samsung Galaxy Note10+. This morning when I unlocked my phone I was presented with a new update. But this didn&#39;t seem to be your average Joe basic update. It&#39;s called, &quot;One UI 4 Upgrade (Android 12)&quot;. I&#39;m wondering if when a phone like mine has this drastic of an update, do you go back to update it and use it again and do another review? Will you review this new update?
Have you ever dropped a phone down those stairs???
Finished my micro payments last month with the Note 10+ water 2 years usage.... I&#39;m debating between the S22+ or the S22 Ultra. You&#39;re right about the S-Pen..... After while you tend to forget about it.
Omg I was about to buy one of these cuz great deal on them certified pre owned with Verizon. But no Aux jack!? I always need that port at some point. Some of the trucks at work dont have a Bluetooth setup so I need an Aux cable to hook it up for music or podcasts. So dissapointed
MKBHD wears illuminati T-shirt
Still using the Aura Glow Note10 Plus as my primary 29 months later keeping my lightly-used Note20 Ultra as my reserve until I see where the Note Series <i>might</i> be headed. The Note10 Plus remains a powerfully capable device.
anyone know how I can win a free Samsung Note 10 plus??
what about in 2022?
Rewatching this in 2022, and Marques saying S11 is sounding weird 😅
it&#39;s a beautiful phone
Let&#39;s hope that his final exams will be on cell phones.
Update 2021-22 on this phone rn still good
Great review man. You&#39;re witty and that&#39;s pretty sorely lacking from tech channel content creators, imo. Subbed.
his shirt is iluminati
I just got this phone and I love it
Still valid
Best line of a review video I&#39;ve ever heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=655">10:55</a> &quot;it&#39;s honestly better than the ones that I hate&quot;
Imagine if the front camera hole doubled as a headphone jack.
Sir, it has been 2 years since this phone was launched and now 2021 is going on and 2022 is about to come.  But if I buy this phone now, will it work for me or should I go for another phone 🤔
I love my Note 10+ in Aura Glow  :)
Glad that i got mine today
are you illuminati ?
The heck with flips and folds...a chunk of glass and metal is the way to go
One of the best favourite brand Samsung☺️ i love this brand and this phone experience is so good👌phone design so awesome
I want that home screen wallpaper
It has 4 cameras
2 years after still rocking ma Note 10+
I understand your thoughts on the phone.
Watching this now and seeing him complain about high refresh rate and after this no one complain about iphone having no high refresh rate
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=371">6:11</a> WTF?
Its good to be back. Still using a note 10 plus. But samsungs software update ruin the air gestures.
*No*<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=372">6:12</a> look his hands 🙌 <br>He got hunted
Question, what&#39;s the difference between the note 10 plus and the note 10plus 5g?
illuminate shirt👀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=655">10:55</a> can somebody tell me which app is that, pls
out of the 256 GB of internal storage ....how many of that is SYSYTEM MEMORY?? (cant be erased memory)
hate phones that cant dual screen
where can I find the background image he has on
It&#39;s 60 hertz...really? Get a life humans.
Can someone tell me the difference between the note 10 plus vs the note 10 plus 5g version apart from one being 5g ?
Great phone
High refresh rate over rated takes to much power
I was dreaming on this phone but now I am watching this video on my 20 Ultra.
Finally got Mine 😭😫<br>Goddammit I love this phone!!
All you did was complain about this phone the whole video.
I love you 💗 bro
Still love this phone two years later with a clear case to show off the color!
Note 9 owner and I&#39;ve been loving this phone for years.<br>I just finally dropped and broke my screen and originally was just going to replace it but I think its time to upgrade to the 10+ instead.<br>Love the note but I refuse to spend over 1k on a cell phone. Prices are down to 500 these days on the 10 so im happy
The Note 10 Plus was probably my favorite Note from the line. I&#39;d abuse the battery throughout the whole day and still break 4AM with little over 30% battery left. That thing was a monster. The Note 20 Ultra needs to be topped off by mid afternoon most days at least with my usage.
I paid $200 for my note 10 plus. And it&#39;s the best phone I&#39;ve ever owned lol
Damn 1,100 dollars when it came out. 😄 I just bought one for $155 unlock in 2021. You gotta be crazy to pay retail price. 🤣
Why is it new price at 2021
2021 and this is still my favourite phone ever.
like the pen to have customers sign with it for invoices and credit card charges<br>Just selected 2, 12 mini
he said that its like 1000 but i found it on ebay for like 400
Aural glow is ugly imo
Best phone I&#39;ve ever owned
The iphone 12 pro max STILL doesnt have a higher refresh rate
2 minute silence for headphone jack and bixby button
I&#39;m Obsessed With This Phone ☠️
mkbhd: complains about 60hz<br>also mkbhd: records in 30fps
bruh really? the Illuminati tee
This is my old man&#39;s phone
watching in July 2021 , and currently using this phone since Aug 2019.
Who&#39;s the mom?!<br>👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
Why am I watching a review of a phone that I&#39;ve had for a year and a half now?
Skinn it NEVER... I paid 1100 CASH for my phone.
Mine recently got left on top of my car I drove back seen it getting run over, front  screen worked still only just but was glitchy a bit.<br>Rear screen stuffed and S pen stuffed.<br>In for repair right now <br>Perfect phone
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=250">4:10</a> Take off the animations, and you&#39;ll get a much faster response from the fingerprint. Mine is not slow like that.. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I have an 8 Pro, a mi 10 t Pro, s20fe poco f3 and I keep coming back to this phone its just beautiful and it flies, the rest will be sold on ebay, the higher refresh is great but, note 10 plus is smooth enough. More so with Samsung browser and YouTube is buttery smooth, don&#39;t feel I&#39;m missing anything
I bought one, it&#39;s was suppose to be brand new open box from a guy on ebay named bob_cat wireless. The phones speaker broke within 2 months and it keeps locking up and freezing and I have to reset it, the phone is super laggy as well. I came from an s9 plus and loved that phone. I contacted Bob_cat wireless and he told me I&#39;m shit out of luck and ignored me, I can&#39;t make calls on the phone or listen to videos, the phone cost me $700. Next time I&#39;ll buy brand new from Samsung, my mistake.
Hmm...
Why does everyone think no bezel or very small bezel is a good thing? Bezels are Good, they prevent you from accidentally launching a App or changing screens, on my Note 9 I will many times bump a App icon and launch it or cause the the screen to change from the home screen to one of my other screens. Also the camera cut out sucks, I don&#39;t want a black dot at the top of my phones screen. Also no finger print reader on the back stinks, It&#39;s easier to tap the back of phone with one and then the front on the glass where there is not tactile feed back to an actual finger print reader button or device.
I love the music he chooses for the intros
If anyone wondering about the intro music it&#39;s blood on your hands- jordyn edmonds
Place Sumsung note10+ pen program?
Wat with the shirt
Why I do not like you&#39;re review is that it&#39;s just an average user review  when it comes to top smartphones like this.... You can&#39;t review a phone of this type without a significant game processing review and that&#39;s why power users will buy it... 12 GB ram is not meant for Facebook and camera... especially testing it on PES PS2 OR WII games using Play! emulator or Dolphin emulator is a kill for all youngsters and like we in the gaming community... you can even test it on call of duty or PUBG... THAT WILL BE STUNNING!! <br><br>Apart from that your reviews are cool and awesome I must say
Is it too late to buy this guy in 2021?
I agree with you on the refresh rate Samsung ought to be ridiculed over and over for shrimping on such an expensive phone Samsung starting to piss me off pretty bad they took away action memo I might just leave Samsung and go buy an iPhone
BUY A BOOK XDDDD
i love big phones
Higher refresh rate vs battery life, I&#39;ll take battery life
Ever And Ever Note 10 + Is My Favourite Mobile Forever I Love It A Lot
Illuminati confirmed
Note has better fingerprint
Love that intro music!!
Watching this on my Note 10 Plus in June 2021. This phone is an absolute beast.
Can I have the Note 10+?☺️
Guys, don&#39;t buy this Galaxy Note 10 or Note 10+. A lot of Samsung users especially those in the community at Samsung Members app (Philippines) are complaining on the &quot;S Pen Disconnected Error&quot;. Almost everyday, same compliant arises, and I&#39;m one of them. I came from iPhone, 3 years ago then returned to Android choosing Samsung, but the experience is so frustrating. To this date, No official advisory from Samsung HQ has been made. The complaints in the Samsung community are growing. My money isn&#39;t worth it for a flagship phone worth Php60,990.00 and then they&#39;re giving me this ordeal. Not fair. So this is it. Nothing more, nothing less.
this video is so helpful and informing... thanks
The pen is blue! The pen is blue! The $%@#^&amp;* pen is blue!!! 🤣🤣🤣 (watch Liar Liar, starring Jim Carrey)
Is it a good buy in June 2021?
Another Apple review of Apple main competitor. A businessman will not even care if the refresh rate is 60 or more, since all operations are fluid and stutterless. This is not a toy it is a tool.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=3">0:03</a>
PLEASE DO A LG V60
The note 10+ deserves more credit than wat u gave. Not pitnicking, more whinny now.
You have a one wheel omg can you do on a video on that
watching in 2021 and he saying s11 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Someone stole my phone!!!!!<br>Officer: What colour was it?<br>Me: Ever seen the back of a CD?
why one eye on your fucking T-shirt
I just upgraded from a iPhone xs max to note 10 plus today &amp; I love it for sure their is a lot of features, on this phone that stands out battery life is great the camera 📷 is mind blowing for sure it takes high quality pics but I&#39;m still learning things about this phone but watching video 📹 it definitely shows me a lot of things that I may have missed.
Watching this on my note 10 +
Theres no coming back for me on this gadget videos addiction loophole
Samsung 10+ is killing iT
What color do you want on your new phone?<br>Samsung: yes
Is it just me or on every video i see about samsung flagships i see the tesla app on every phone
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=320">5:20</a> YOU PROBABLY SAW THIS BUT(T) COMING FROM A MILE AWAY 😂
Ah the mythical S11 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=228">3:48</a> 😂
the camera bump is there but scratching the hell out of your camera lens doesn&#39;t effect anything else 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤪 but when a phone costs $1,100 who cares right? just go with it 🤪😂
Illuminati t shit
Illuminati t-shirt boo 👎
That&#39;s the phone I&#39;m using right now
Marquis, 6 just ordered the Note 10++ 5 g. Is it really a 5g phone? I haven&#39;t opened the box yet. Please tell me.
So pretty until now &lt;3
I want something different. Maybe I look at this one now
May i have a Iphone 10 plzzzx
The terrific shelf oppositely injure because british expectantly increase out a breakable fireplace. nonstop, gleaming decrease
can anyone please give me the link of intro music. TIA.
S11?
The diligent tree neuropathologically call because elbow randomly precede as a overjoyed good-bye. striped, material slip
❗I truly believe this Samsung phones are not worth all that money that they are sold for!!<br>This gay color phone has way too many problems not to mention the ridiculous slow processor that has never changed!!! I am looking for a better or just a total different phone and stay away from this garbage Samsung phones❗
awesume?
Me too I love boxy sharped edges displays
this guy is jelouse of samsung for some reason
No headphone jack is such garbage. I refuse to wear wireless headphones. You can&#39;t tell me those radio waves going straight through your head isn&#39;t going to have long term consequencea.
Good video and keep up the good videos
Watching a reveiw of my own phone 1 year later. Lol
You must be f**king kidding me? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=374">06:14</a> (Pyramide and the All S E E I N G  E Y E) and throughout the video<br>Deep State F*****. Couldn&#39;t be more obvious! Gender/Transgender colors on the pillows of his in the background.<br>SYMBOLISM ARE YOUR DOWNFALLS!
illuminati slave, much?
Is it better than p30 pro?
Anyone know the wallaper on that phone ?
I&#39;ll have mine Tuesday!
am just about to buy note 10+ this year
It would be nice if you had a frame of reference for the size other than your hand
Still using it to this day, great device all around! Exynos. Cheers from The Netherlands 🇳🇱
Psychedelic?! It&#39;s fucking holo......oh lord why is it that reviewers don&#39;t know this?!
I got this phone for 300$ because I know the phone guy and he has his own shop and I gotta say it&#39;s the best 300 I&#39;ve ever spent
Hey dude!Stop wearing Illuminati Freemasonary T Shirts
jazza
codelyoko
Honestly I wish they used the thumbprint finger scanner like the S 10 e as it&#39;s more efficient
if you had a job where you did presentations then you could use the Dex feature to do the presentations from your phone this is a professional&#39;s phone it&#39;s not for YouTuber but for somebody who actually does something like medical sales or somebody who presents to crowds and does professional presentations you can do your slide presentations you can sit there and use it like a computer with a keyboard it&#39;s great when you&#39;re taking the picture and you want to set the phone up and use the s Pen as your remote control.
I honestly think that for the price that they charge they should be made out of stainless steel at least the frame. It should have a quad dac and a wireless mouse for your TV / IR blaster. If they&#39;re going to charge you close to $1,300 for a phone it should have everything but the kitchen sink like my note 9 did like my note 3 did
why dont we - an avg user, capture such amazing pics with our flagship phones. Just looking at photos from my note10+
Someone please tell me the name of that intro song(not the music) please!
Hmmm good idea that twirl your s pen to Fwd YouTube! Need something tapping the screen all the times abitty outdated lol Normal one 4000mha not that much difference 4300
Watching this in 2021 giggling cause MKB said you couldn&#39;t wait till the s11 Samsung lol. Samsung went to infinite and beyond 🚀
“Um, So what color is your phone”<br><b>Its complicated</b>
entersandman
it&#39;s so pretty
me smiling while watching this
Remember, your devil cant save you ..
You are illuminati. Devil follower....
A difrent phone galaxy note 10 +💙
just got the note 10 plus after my note 9 did not came back from repair. <br>The last generation of sd card support Note! Good old times
No matter how you look at it, if they left the headphone jack in and introduced high refresh rate, you would have had a smaller battery on a more power demanding phone, making this beast useless.
The back looks so cheap tho i don’t understand who likes colours like that
That t-shirt tells everything you need to know.
<b>And now they might abandon their favorite children...</b>

Did anyone  bought  the verizon  galaxy Note 10+ 5g with no compatibility with there 5g network. Verizon  says  that  the phone  only works with 5G UW. We pay $200 dollars extra for  a 5g device that&#39;s is supposed to be 5g built-in, the phone  doesn&#39;t advertise  5g UW like other  phones do.
friday
what kinda case is that?
Anyone still enjoying the note 10+ like me :)
you are wearing an illuminati t-shirt.
this is not the right place to rant at all lmao but here i go:<br>i got the note 10+ because i&#39;ve wanted a note phone for so long but could never afford it so i was super excited to finally get it. and when it arrived, my roommate was next to me and we unboxed it together. she has a xiaomi redmi 9 or something and i didnt want to make her feel bad or something so i went along with her when she compared the phones on a website that there&#39;s not much of a difference between them. however, it makes me kinda salty when she gets an attitude about it, almost making me feel bad for buying a phone &quot;that&#39;s so pricy because its a samsung&quot;, which is true to some extent. however, please tell me i&#39;m not crazy when i say that you can&#39;t compare hers with the freaking note 10....
Tf he talking about ? 5 hours of screen time ?? A let down on the speakers ?? .i mean lets be real . . I am not degrading appke but . Lets do a drop test  🤣🤣 i mean i work in a fancy chocolate shop and i saw all my customers most of them has broken iphone 11 pro . .jusy one drop . ..ya&#39;ll feel me ? 🤣🤣
The only thing i dont understand why do most people never complains about the iphones with it 60hz
The t-shirt 😞😐
Why is watching this a year later with my note 10 plus so satisfying
No they remove headphone jack cuz its water resistant
What&#39;s the name of this wallpaper?
120hz is a gimmick

Dude! You have 13 million subs. How have I never heard of your channel till now?

Hello my friend.  I watched your review videos. I only have a question like this, is it normal for the speaker to vibrate behind the phone in note 10 plus model?
Why this recomended me today btw Merry Christmas
90 hertz isn’t that important thats the only thing it lacks
Best phone ever after s7 edge
Why don&#39;t they make removable batteries phones anymore?!
Had this phone over a year and have used it to its full potential. Never had any issues. Versus every apple iPhone I&#39;ve owned gave me problems within three months.
Great vid.. Which camera setup do you use to make videos bro?
My dream phone
Marquess is illuminati
should i buy note10 plus in 2020 December ? or any other better option in this range
where can i doenload your wallpaper?
I&#39;m still keeping my note 9 cuz of the headphone jack and its my fav
illuminati fucker
Ami I the only one who thinks that the Aura Glow color is tacky as hell? All reviewers are praising it but I think the black is way classier.
I think I have a serious OCD.. I can&#39;t stand the Google apps with the white background at the same line with apps that don&#39;t have regular background
Wow! I love this video to watch Samsung Galaxy Note 10+
Looks like my A90 5G (2019)
Samsung probably lied about the size of their battery or my new one has a small battery. Why:I used a have a note 9 from launch. It was said the battery can last up to 3 days and sometimes it did; my batt used to last for just about 2 days on high use. So max was 3 days.  <br><br>With the note 10+ i get a full day, without using it for calls, just googling and few vids on YouTube here and there because I also have a apple phone 11 that is new. The note was a replacement phone after a terrible experience with Samsung customer service(the worst I&#39;ve ever ever seen). Was supposed to be a brand new phone(looks like it,fresh in it&#39;s box). I am stunned how a 4000mhz batt could last 2 days ob heavy use while a 4500 batt not lasting a full 24hrs when I&#39;m using another phone along with it and not even using calls. <br><br>Overall in my opinion Samsung have nice design but the quality built is not so. They have the worst customer service, and literally became ill getting them to fix my note 9 that they messed up after them changing the battery. <br><br>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll buy from them again!
Oh boy look at his illuminati t-shirt
His t shirt is illuminating
I&#39;ve always bought Note series but it looks like its time for a change. Thanks!
wallpaper link please... anyone???
Because wat to wat way better than sansun s9 +plus thanks,
&quot;Big glass phone&quot;<br>Marques 2019
Marques could get a phone that doesn’t need charge and still somehow get 6 hours of screen on time
Anyone watching this even after  note 20 series released?
What do you think about buying the note10+ right now ? <br>I have the S9 and want to upgrade on black Friday. With the release of note20, the note10+ dropped the price, and I think it&#39;s worth the purchase right now ?<br>Do you advise to buy this phone or another one ?
Is ok of mine note 10plus has gaps between screen frame and frame backglass the gaps are tiny which u can only slip tiny paper is that fault or is ok
Pramod 😂😂😂
4-5 hrs is so low
Not only big glass phone it is a big ass phone!
Please give me this wallpaper please 😍<br>I try to found this wallpaper but note found
Hi @mkbhd , which phone would you recommend out of galaxy note 10+ and oneplus 8 pro in terms of productivity? Please.
Is this snapdragon or exynos ?
I want that wallpaper
If this is 1100, i am sad that it half sucks
Here is a trick:set up multiple scans on difrent angels of your finger and then its much faster i know because i have a note 10 +
Nobody:<br><br><br><br>Marques: I have been having parents for 26 years now...
I&#39;m thinking of getting this. Not 20 doesn&#39;t interest me
Different <br>N<br>ice
I love this phone and want to switch to Android so bad! How do I co-exist with my husband and children that all have iPhones? Thank you
I would suggest Galaxy Note 10 Lite for around 40% of the Note 10 plus price plus it has ear phone  Jack, you can have almost all the important future of the Note 10 plus .
And at the end of 2020, &quot;The iPhone&quot; still have 60Hz :))) Whenever Apple upgrade to higher refresh rate, they will call it &quot;The massive upgrade&quot; &quot;A game changer&quot; :)))
S Pen: Harry.....Potter......game.......??.....
I just watched your Ipone 12 and Iphone 12 pro review and 60htz display in October 2020 is no big deal for you, but it was a big deal in August 2019. Funny, right!! After watching your almost every video, now I believe you are Iphone biased person. And sometimes you are so biased that it feels like a sponsored video. :) Anyways, I enjoyed your videos so far, but not anymore.
fka twigs
I love watching things I can&#39;t affourd
MKBHD is complaining about high refresh rate 1.5years ago and okay with the Iphone 12 now :/ :/
Am I the only one who is used to big screens now because of this Godsend <br>PHONE? 😍😍😍😍
Just wondering where all these phones go  after you make a review on it?.
galaxy note 10+ or Iphone 11?
Pls have subtitle as sometimes im watching yr video in the library and my earpod batt jst die on me😅
So does the pen work for selfies using a stick tripod ?<br>Next, no 90hz display? Looks like Samsung is definitely ditched, like they ditched us.
I use this note 10 plus and I feel happy to have this amazing technology
Transparent skin on this phone would be sick!🔥
Power button on the left. Blehhhh
Just got the Note 10 in 2020 and galaxy buds+ to make it a compete set..way better and Cheaper than what&#39;s out there atm...Cant justify the New prices... just ridiculous
Exynos version not good
Sana all
Reply yes if ur cool
He doesn&#39;t like this phone. But this is unique. All the others are almost the same. There are different just in spec. Nothing in real life.
twinkle twinkle little star
I have one, like it but cracked 2 screens already wearing the Samsung provided silicone skin.  In fact my friends who have them also have had cracked screens.  So not a fan of this phone or the curved screen design.  Not practical for most people. Had Pixel phone before and it was a steady performer and rigid enough for daily use without worry of cracking your screen.
Those S-pen air gestures are only useable in distant self images
anyone know the name of that wallpaper<br>I NEED TO KNOW THIS
@ 0.5 animation speed I don’t know the difference with 60Hz display.<br>PS: Why is Apple always the last to get anything? Pretty sure we won’t see the punch hole design until at least 2025. They just now released widgets and an app drawer on IOS 14 update, which android has had for..how long?
So, to update, at least in Canada, the internal storage and RAM upgrades are no longer offered for any of the S and Note series. They still list it in the description but when you go to purchase...
I can not believe I got this phone for $70. I went to my local flea market looking for a pendant for my necklace and some random guy walked up to me and asked me if I was interested in buying a Galaxy Note 10+, I was skeptical at first cause I didn&#39;t know if it was stolen or not so I almost turned it down until he showed me that he had it activated and it was his personal phone, I did a quick IMEI check and it came back that it wasn&#39;t blacklisted and that it was an unlocked phone so I was interested, he was asking $100 for it and I was able to bargain down to $70 I had no idea it was such an expensive phone or I would&#39;ve just gave him the $100 (feel kinda bad actually)  I got a hella of a deal and I ever see that guy I&#39;m going to give him his $30 just because but this phome is great especially for the price I got it for
Wtf why am i watching this even though im literally using the note 10+??????!!!
I&#39;ll but this phone on 2023.
you are wrong its s20<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=211">3:31</a>
Li-Ion 3500 mAh why
This is an incredible phone BUT I went through 3 of them within 7 months because they have a very common problem where the phone will not let you charge the battery because &quot;phone&#39;s temperature is too low.&quot; They cannot repair it at a repair facility (for some reason) though I&#39;ve seen it done on YouTube.<br>If you buy this phone be sure to get insurance, because you very well may need it.
Congrats on 12M subs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=414">6:54</a> Marquez congratulations. This is PROOF Samsung watches ur videos. They did ditch it, and yeah.... everyone noticed.........
This phone is really impressive!
What would happen if samsung got there hands on apples A13 chip and put it in their phones.?
Ever since I bought my 10+ can&#39;t stop watching this
Who’s watching this again cause they don’t want to buy note 20 ultra
Where can I get the wallpaper in the one plus phone?
I am looking for a deal for this.
Thank you for the review!! Just ordered one online, upgrading from Note5 - I&#39;m not going to know myself lol!!!
got mine yesterday!!! Sweet &lt;3
Eluminati shirt😲😲
Damn you note 10 plus, I hate your 60 hertz
Very good looking phone but im going for the note 20 ultra
Thanks for inform us that you&#39;re a member of illuminati!!! It&#39;s fun😂😂😂😂
The way you film and edit these videos is one of a kind, love it
Hey there! I have a question. Buying a Galaxy Note 20 over Galaxy Note 10 Plus worth in 2020?
I did see the but from a mile away 😂
what was that wallpaper app? does anyone know?
So good phone
Marques can you please tell me where did you buy the casing woody like silvery in the video ?? Please
The question is. Do I upgrade to the Note 10+ or the Note 20 Ultra 🤔
STOLEN PHONE <br><br>OFFICER: What color is it?<br>ME: Chameleon
I&#39;m a musician but not a producer and I hear something with the zoom in mic feature. The background noise sounds fairly constant but the voice definitely gets louder. I would guess that it is using a combination of noise reduction (like the headphones) and frequency adaptive compression to bring the low sounds of the high change value frequencies up in volume. It would be like having a robot audio engineer fuck around with it in protools for a bit, just in real time. I highly doubt it has anything to do with triangulating the source of the sound with the dual microphones.
Whats the name of the app for those wallpaper?
When I saw how good this phone looked and it has a pen and it can run power word and excel i had to switch this makes apple feel like a an expensive with no features
how did Samsung move from this camera bump to the Note 20 Ultra camera bump 😂
I&#39;m looking to purchase a new phone on verizon I have a note 8. What&#39;s your best pick for me?
Look at that weird t shirt
I am from the future. I can tell u that there is no s11 and yes iphone 11 has a night mode
guys im confused between this phone and oneplus 8 pro ? can u advice me ?
If yall want a cheaper phone and a headphone jack, just get the note 10 lite, it has the s pen, headphone jack. 6 gigs ram, 4500 mh battery, 128 gigs storage
This whole review is BIASED!! Note 10+ is a ridiculous beast!! And the DISPLAY  &amp;  SPEAKERS are insane!!!! Nothing compares
Why are you wearing this illuminati t-shirt? Are you Illuminati?
Watching this on me Note 10+ 😉🤪
Haha I&#39;m watching using this phone
It’s not my favorite UI, but it’s better than the ones I hate. Lol, savage.
Who&#39;s watching this on they note 8 or 9
4-5 hours of sot is mediocre at best. where are the android phones that can do 10 like the iphone 11 pro max? i&#39;ve got the s9+ right now and im afraid i will have to go apple this year
what&#39;s the wallpaper app you used..
WTF IS THAT HOLE ON UR HAND
&quot;Skinning it&quot;
Hey im from the future <br>And im  here to tell you that they changed the s11&#39;s name to the S20 :V
Still the best phone till date🔥 love it
What about the battery
Let&#39;s be honest,  you are a phone lover.  This needs to be reviewed by someone that do use the Samsung Notes everyday, with full use.  I use my Note 4 S Pen  everyday, especially being able to select text that sights won&#39;t allow you to touch select.  Awesome, and I can&#39;t go back.  What the latest Note that&#39;s coming out, I will seriously consider my next upgrade.
Note 10+ :  6.8&quot; display, no jack 4300 MAh battery<br>Note 10 lite:  6.7&quot; display, headphone jack, 4500 MAh battery. Did I miss something or are we just getting less features for more money?
Also, how is the phone / voice quality? Funny how that&#39;s not a top 5 characteristic of a phone...anyone?
Am I the only one looking to see what apps this dude has?
I completely disagree with this review and I love your channel and content!!!
Intro
Remember Marq, you were offered the world by the prince of this world in the final times and you took the offer
All ports have 1 line of symmetry??<br>Why u wearing a illuminati shirt you dork. Trolling or making sure every port has 1 line of symmetry
I can not wait enough for the note 20 to come out so I can get this cheaper!!
Spot on with the 3 5mm jack.  How arrogant of Samsung to assume that we don&#39;t use our smartphone for recording interviews with a duel wired mike whilst charging &quot;from the wall&quot;. Remember the days when everyone had a Nokia charger..... similar marketing mistake. These companies get &#39;smarter&#39; but yet, they do not learn.
Those shoes though! 🔥 🤭😶

Enjoyed the review, thanks! I have a 10+ on order, and am biting my fingernails waiting for it to arrive. :-D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=319">5:19</a> that&#39;s what she said
What is so pro about that tip
Crazy credit music
Lol
I wouldn’t skin it. Why? Because i NEVER get the skin on correctly and it looks hideous.. And yes. Paying $1000+ for a phone you bet im gonna nitpick that sucker to death..
Can the S pen be used on any of the newer Samsung phone
Where can I find the background of the phone in the review?😪
Yea just got this phone,  got be picky when its $1100.
This guy is awesome man
I upgraded from a note 9 to this 10+ and to be honest, so far, I really don&#39;t see much difference. The only major difference for me is I couldn&#39;t keep an otterbox on my 9 due to the fingerprint sensor. I outright own the 9, and my screen broke, im going to get it fixed. I&#39;m leasing the 10+ and im pretty pissed about losing my headphone jack. For this price why can&#39;t I have it? I can&#39;t have a phone without the spen, I use it so much!
A quick ques to you Samsung or apple or one plus which one is your all-time favourite 2020
Wallpaper link please?
It&#39;s very fast at 144 Hertz!
Honestly the design of the phone is number one for me. it’s my favorite design and I’m glad they are also bringing the same design to the  GN20+ or Ultra. I’m do for an upgrade so I’m either getting the GN20+ or iPhone 12 Pro Max. this Samsung design is so tough for me to skip though.
Watching this on my brand new note 10+
illuminati exposed...
Awesome has no u in it
So much complaining, really the most i have heard
People on Samsung:<br>• It&#39;s so expensive.<br>• No 90hz or 120hz display.<br>• The design is &quot;okay&quot;<br>• Most of the newly introduced features are gimmick.<br><br>People on Apple:<br>• Finally put an ultrawide lens on its recent flagship phone: &quot;I N N O V A T I O N.&quot;<br>• There&#39;s not so much difference between the display of Iphone 10 line up and Iphone 11 line up: &quot;Well that&#39;s fine.&quot;<br>• Now supports fast charging: &quot;I N N O V A T I O N.&quot;<br>• Also don&#39;t have 90hz or 120hz but you don&#39;t usually hear the complain about it.<br>• You don&#39;t hear these reviewers complain how &quot;expensive&quot; an Iphone is even though for a fact that there&#39;s only slight improvements every year 💁‍♂️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=139">2:19</a> I Would put a Mous Clarity Case on it
Hello marques i&#39;ve asked you a question on fb but i guess your busy but i&#39;m thinking to switch from huawei mate 10 pro owned for 2 yrs and everything working perfectly i was wondering if the note 10 + is worth buying in 2020 really would apreciate your opinion am from Mauritius island and being reviewing all your reviews available on the note 10 + and really the s20 line-up is excluded regarding the screen issue and cracks on camera glass faced by uses already owning the s20 series as getting spare parts in mauritius is quite struggling.
Note 10 plus now is faster and better than before because of the updates that&#39;s been received. The Fingerprint ultrasonic scanner is way more snappier now and the touch screen sensitivity. Can you give another review Please! Bernz from Philippines 🇵🇭😁
Wallpaper plz
WhT up with you arm that a big scab
4 to 5 hours of screen on time! What are you doing that is sucking that much power! I get like at least 7-12 hours of battery life.
Im thinking about downgrading from my s20 ultra. Should i?
Fu*king iluminaties
I agree that clicbait got me, but learned some stuff abou hacking camera.
Recently I bought a Note 10+, (SM-N975U) the AT&amp;T variant. The challenge I&#39;m having is that I&#39;m unable to update to android 10. It has failed the OTA and Smart switch options. I went on Sammobile and downloaded the version of the OS for my variant but it wasn&#39;t for AT&amp;T it was USC.. Can you or anyone else on this thread help me please..?
Is it worth to upgrade my note 8 to this. I&#39;m pretty right on the line to upgrade or not to upgrade.
So:<br>Price: 1K$ <br>No IR Blaster<br>No 3.5mm Jack<br>No Call Recording<br>No Notification LED<br>No Screen Wake Up Notification<br>No Full Third Party Apps Compatibility<br>Power Button on the Wrong Side<br>Loudspeakers crappy Sound<br>...<br>I believe Samsung have become to &quot;think different&quot; :)))

Note 9 is better
Plz review sony experia 1 mark 2
One thing with the finger print scanner go into setting and turn off the animations and it quickens up
He&#39;s said other phones get average rating while having the same screen on time. Not very consistent.<br><br>But because it&#39;s a physically big battery it&#39;s good??
I think he&#39;s nitpicking on it and stuff and notice more features like the disadvantages and advantages of the phone, etc. because he&#39;s seen A LOT of impressive and non impressive phones in his life so if a phone is lacking something he&#39;ll notice that quickly thanks to comparisons to other phones he has had and/or used...
Where can I get that wallpaper? Anyone have a link
Intro: Blood on your hands
What about burn in? My Google Pixel 3 (15 months later) has some significant burn in. Also the lens can&#39;t do video too well, it flickers every 5 seconds or so. It&#39;s ok for pictures but I got an SLR so not use so much. So some pretty major flaws but maybe I got a bad one. I love the Pixel 3 just the 4 was a dud so may jump ships. Need a good display though!
Nice shirt.
It does know have a 120 refresh rate
looks like the back of a cd
One word: Beautiful♥️
as a long time note user, and while i recognize this is a great phone, im afraid my next phone will be an iphone...
Just ordered a pair from Consumer Cellular for $900 each on sale! Should arrive tomorrow or the next day. It&#39;ll be good to have a Samsung again finally! Been using cheap BYOP&#39;s from Motorola for the past two years now.
hes so biased 😂😂😂😂 lit every samsung review hahahahahaha
Yes. The lack of a headohone Jack is kind of a head scratcher. Especially when they made fun of apple for just this thing.  I guess those dongles weren&#39;t so stupid after all.
why dont you never talk about samsungs etra features like samsung dex? is it bcuz you don&#39;t use it? I use it and think many others do.

So, no one&#39;s gonna talk about the intro music ?<br>Please tell me which song it is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=53">0:53</a>: Huh?! It&#39;s actually stainless steel on the sides according to Samsung&#39;s ad and Customer Service instead of aluminum, Marques. Well I can testify to it that it&#39;s Stainless rather than  aluminium just like on Note8/Note9 as I am personally using it for almost 3mos now.
Nice 👍🏽
R u not using spen really i pity u .we r using it&#39;s a great thing.... Really spen ( stylus)  is super powerful gadget  samsung is only one company to make this .....Luv u samsung .Samsung&#39;s all note series r unique than other branded smartphones .....
what is it&#39;s touch response time? like we see iPhones display is 60hz but touch response is 120hz. what&#39;s note 10 + touch sampling rate?<br>didn&#39;t find anything about it
$1100 bucks and they couldn&#39;t add a friggin&#39; 3,5 mm jack...such a shame...
What happend to your elbow?

You are my favorite phone reviewer on YouTube. I like your matter-of-fact style, and the lack of theatrics. But like many tech reviewers, you have developed &quot;gymnastics judge syndrome&quot;. Meaning you focus in on the smallest of (perceived) faults, and don&#39;t pay enough attention to the wondrous things.<br><br>Example: The amazing, under-glass, ultrasonic, fingerprint reader, which is borderline fucking witchcraft, is a half a second too slow?!?!?<br><br>If that is something that actually bothers you, then you will never be truly happy with anything ever.
you is illuminati...
Omg I ordered this phone and it&#39;s coming today, can&#39;t wait! I had this s3 for 4 years. Definitely a huge improvement.
Maybe Samsung couldn&#39;t get the high refresh rate to work with the S pen. No other phone with a 90 or 120 Hz screen has a stylus.

How is it that they are able to implement a complex technology like a finger print sensor under neath the screen display but they can&#39;t seem to get completely rid of the hole punch for the camera by just hiding the camera under neath the display and then just turning off the pixels at the camera area to let light in? I mean, how hard can this be?

you get way more than 4/5 hours SOT   most the fuckers walk around with wifi mobile data bluetooth location on all day everyday  battery drain much.  theres no need for that
Watching on my note 10+...speaker is crazy
Little did he know Samsung would call the next generation s20
Only guy I go to for phone reviews
S10: Headphone jack<br>S10+: HeadPhoneJack<br>S10 e: headphone jack<br>note 10: HeAdPhOnEjAcK<br>note 10+: #!@%)&amp;($@*!#*
which app you got this wallpaper from?
Note 10 never got it&#39;s own review.:)
The S11 😂😂... poor Marques
Illuminati confirmed your
Zoom in audio.  You needed other sounds around in the room to test.  Then you wouldn&#39;t have thought it just made you louder.
There is no s11 it&#39;s all 20
Hey Marquez, whats on your opinion on note9 vs n10+ on daily basis? Is it faster, smoother, does extra 6gb of RAM really show up? Also, how cameras compare in daily use, and battery?<br>And finally, forever-lasting question, should n9 users upgrade to n10+?
Which is your wallpaper?
Who needs a headphone jack use bluetooth easier to do stuff with bluetooth headphones
I have the note 9. Im happy
Illuminati shirt ?... so you&#39;re a sellout ... i just unsubscribed .
60hz ewww
“No headphone jack” 😭 😭 <b>STOP!</b> ✋🏾🛑
should you use the font and screen size tiny ?????? please answer
Using galaxy familiy since iphone 7, I never got to use the notch.
why is he wearing a shirt with the illuminati symbol,
Whattttttt!!!? The speakers ain&#39;t great man? That&#39;s a big no for me. I think you criticize more than you appreciate. Go watch Flossy Carter&#39;s review on this same phone.
The quality of this video. Amazing .
Apple: we removed the headphone jack because we want to achieve a wireless future.<br>Android users: apples dumb we need a headphone jack no one should buy an iPhone now<br>Samsung: we removed headphone jack<br>Everyone: eh fine we don’t need it
Illuminati t&#39;shirt
Anybody noticed white S Pen at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=626">10:26</a>? White colour released at later stage AFAIK.
Would any of you swap a pro max for a note 10 plus .
I do gotta say I&#39;ve had my note 10 plus for 6 months now and I&#39;m still loving it !!! I&#39;m not gonna lie since the galaxy s20 ultra dropped I&#39;ve been so tempted to upgrade......but I know it would be a mistake. I cant live without the s-pen. I love the Note line so much!!!!
Thank you !  I saw the aura glow in the Verizon store and I only saw the silver....thanks for explaining the color!  What is your favorite color of this phone?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=321">5:21</a> butts are for pooping<br>- Joshua from adventure time-
yea i would skin it
DON&#39;T LICKE THIS COLOR , THE WHITE WORKS BEST FOR ME !!!!!
Watching this on my aura black note10+, using my galaxy buds. Upgraded from an alcatel pop4. Bigger difference than I could ever expect
I like Androids better than iOS, problem I have is that you can&#39;t replace the battery anymore. Seems like a money grab and very unnecessary.
I bought the Note 10 Plus <b>because</b> it has the S-Pen. Love-it and use-it daily. All other features are great accessories too. -Very satisfied customer
Was this the worst note since the note 7?
it is lighter than it seems because it&#39;s lacking a headphone jack
ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED
Love... the hidden infrared range finder.
Hi guys! Can you recommend a phone ranging from $400- $500 with good specs?
What I love about this phone is I watched it in Netflix series. &quot;Crash landing on you.&quot;
i prefer all the buttons on the left side
i just destroyed my A30 along with my knees, damn, my knee still hurts though.
Put a clear case on it, that&#39;s what I did
This phone is perfect . The only negative things you can say about it are that the battery life it&#39;s not amazing especially if you compare it with the Iphone and some Huawei&#39;s phones and it lack the headphone jack . Other than that the note  have pretty much everything anyone can dream off . Some flagship phones have also a slightly better camera but the difference is minimal  .
Your shirt
Where can i find the wallpaper?
Just got one used for 625$ unlocked to from att!! I&#39;m waiting for new note then I&#39;ll upgrade.
There are great quality truly wireless earbuds for $40 in Amazon right now. Stop complaining and get the Tranya T3s. You won&#39;t regret the decision.
Air gestures are bogus...so is the price Samsung.
fuck me I hate charging EVERYTHING.  Bring back the headphone jack.
Subscribe to my channel plzzzzzz
My note 10+ hangs with 12GB... idk what garbage they hv keep inside my note 10+..
the reason this phone is not as heavy is because the battery is less dense, as this allows for faster charging
What&#39;s the call quality like
Don&#39;t use s pen often but when I do it&#39;s important. Still have useful notes from my note 2. It&#39;s also entertaining from time to time just for doodling and sketching out ideas and such.
It’s not the first time a Samsung Note phone removes a major feature. The Note 5 removed the IR blaster.
ILLUMINATI on ur shirt. R U??
I appreciate that you took a picture of a Chick fil a building for the camera review 😂
Dying for it but still can&#39;t afford it
Plzz brother make a video of mate 20pro compare to Samsung note 10plus....
Flossy Carter&#39;s review is better
Wallpaper ???
It&#39;s called HOLOOOOOOO
Good video marques. Watching this on note 10 plus.
You DONT NEED THE SCREEN ON WITH THE ULTRASONIC FINGERPRINT SENSOR. Stop turning the screen on everytime people. And it is real quick when you turn off animations and unlock transition effect.
Where can I get that wallpaper?
I need this phone. I have been using iPhone for a few years now, but every time I upgrade, I’m not impressed. I’m still on the xs max because I’m on the fence. The pen would help me a lot because I carry a notebook with me to take quick notes for my job.
But the note 10/10+ in 2020🙂
Please, can you explain to me why everyone makes such a big deal about losing the jack???? There are so many wireless headphones now. Why would you WANT to be tethered to the phone???
i hate you
that is right off the  bat
I love my note 10 +
I&#39;ve never met a SINGLE PERSON who skins thier phones.
I actually kinda like the speakers on this phone. Some of the best speakers I&#39;ve had since the Nexus 6.
Good people of the internet. Does anybody have link for that wallpaper? I really need it.
Watching note10 reviews while on my note 10 plus
20,000 mah battery <br>Marques: So the battery is really good. I get about 30 mins of screen time
Bruh do you even like anything
I literally watch your videos twice cause I love the way you do it
The pen is great for long text and I like that it can be used to trigger the camera shutter.
Whaaaaaaat? Dude the speaker is loud as hell on this phone.<br>-Note 10+ user
Being a little disappointed in the S20 screen management and noting the The SnapDragon 875 will have 5G in the processor, I will get this until one of those tickels my fancy.  Everything with a SD 865 will be a dinosaur next year and too expensive this year.<br><br>Thank you for your keen revue.<br><br>As a comment, I do appreciate the One+ 7 90 MHz refresh rate, but I am not a gamer and in an application, a quicker refresh rate makes no difference on static content.
Coming from iOS to Android has really been a breath of fresh air. I was seriously stuck in the apple ecosystem for a very long time. Since the iPhone 4 actually. Year after year I&#39;d upgrade but always felt like I wanted to try Android but I always followed the crowd of apple being the best at everything I don&#39;t need to switch. But I&#39;ve had the note 10+ for about 2 months now coming from the 11 pro max and I really like the experience I&#39;ve been having. I like the design a lot, Android software is night and day difference, customization, etc...
Deserves best phone  2019.
Please someone link the wallpaper that in the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=50">0:50</a> minute
Feel like tech reviewers are obsessed with refresh rate. Do normal people even notice or care? My 60hz tv and note 10 plus feel smooth as my 144hz laptop. Maybe I&#39;m blaspheming.
I had a 2012 flagship (iPhone5) and I recently switched to Nokia 6.2 which is just a mid-range and its fine for its price but I would like to have a Note someday just because of its professional capabilities
Marques,  what&#39;s with the Illuminutty shirt why are you promoting them?
<b>Big glass phone</b> 😂

Pardon me but , the one that is getting my attention is your shirt . Thats a great .. triangular design ..
HEY YOU SHOULD HAVE WROTE BUY A TENT INSTEAD OF BUY A BOOK LOL HUH WOULD HAVE BEEN FUNNY FOR HUMOR BRO BUT THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME DECIDE FROM THE NOTE 10 TO THE 10 PLUS SO THUMS UP YO BYE NOW
So should I get the note 10 plus or should I get the s10 plus
Can u pls review ur fav child lite version Samsung note 10lite😃
Great video!!
ILLUMINATI On His TShirt
I&#39;m literally seeing this video on my Note10+ to know a bit more about the phone I just got 3 days ago. 👌
ironic you compare every feature to one plus no more comparison with iphone, one plus has come so far
Honestly who the fuck needs a 6.7 inch screen
Watching this on my note 10+ makes me happy! 😍
The screen/display is really nice, but I went into a shop to get hands-on and the back and sides look and feel a bit plasticly which I didn&#39;t like.
I’ve been with iPhone since the 4s and I’m sooo bored with it 😭 I miss customizing so badly. Often find myself watching these videos but just can’t seem to switch. I find a minor reason here and there that’s ultimately the deal breaker
Cant decide between note 10+ or mate30 pro ☹️ need help people
When your budget realme phone has a bigger battery and bigger memory than a flagship samsung
Flat screen and a 16:9 aspect ratio please!!
Can you have wireless charging with dbrand skin on?
Sorry bro, thumbs down on this video. Way too much complaining over little stuff. 60hz vs 90hz, not going to notice it on a tiny screen, no headphone jack, big deal, their is products that use the type C to 3.5m jack.
Don’t get d brand get sophiguard, they ship faster and have quality skins.
My thing is what more can you do to a phone every year to upgrade it?
Which app did he use for the wallpaper?....looks good !
Is the Samsung Galaxy A10 e  water resistance??
I&#39;m in need of a phone I currently have a galaxy s9+ is this worth still picking up or am I better off just waiting for the next galaxy note ?
Awesome phone, got mine a week ago. It&#39;s the best!😃
That zoom in microphone thing is actually pretty cool
Imagine using a headphone jack
Did you notice any blinking dot beside the front cam when making a phone call and if you have Accidental touch feauture on? I thought they&#39;re dead pixels.
It looks like they melted a CD to the back
Here&#39;s an idea: a tiny attachment that converts any regular wired headphone/earbuds to bluetooth compatible :)
Illuminati agent MKHD
I imagine scrolling through YouTube videos with my S pen while the phone is not in my hand. The phone is pretty big, so some users might get tired always holding it in hand while watching or reading.
so the eye in the pyramid has taken over youtubers as well? interesting
As a contractor I save numerous property maps on my phone in S Note so I can jot down notes right on the maps, which has made my job so much easier, as I used to have a pocketful of folded paper maps. On S Note, each map turns into its own book, forward button clean map, back button past maps so I have a history of my notes. I don&#39;t really see this phone as being the top choice for a casual user, as it&#39;s like a business phone to me.  It&#39;s my mobile office and worth every penny.
I got the iPhone 11 Pro Max 256gb and I seriously regret not getting the note 10 plus .
But the camera not so good weyh.. i more prefer to my 5z boomm...
I’ve watched you on 60hz and 90hz. You’re still kinda annoying on 90 hz. So I don’t think it’s a big deal breaker.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nitpicking at 1100 dollars. What do iPhone users do at 1300?  If I had an phone it would be worse then nitpicking. I’d be pissed off. Not even close to Samsung in feature set.
Illuminate spotted... <br>I  recon if he really has done something with illuminate
Totally ranting about something that&#39;s ok. Really Uncool.
Its funny you said samsung should be able to make a 90hz display considering they are making One Plus 7s displays lol
Can i give it
Why people waste a lot of money on a new phone is beyond me. Like why would you buy a phone that costs $1100 if you can get most of its features on a cheaper phone like the A70?!?!?
this design is beautiful, hopefully i&#39;ll switch my iPhone 8 Plus for the next note (20 probably?). love the videos.
my dumbass brain <br>mk saying big glass phone<br>me hearing bigass<br>me:did he just say a bad word
Wait what no 90hz display on Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus Phones for $1200+?<br>Then what&#39;s the point then?
i use my phone in my left hand so the buttons on the left is better for me.
I thought this video was about the note 10+ he keeps saying note 10 🤔
Is it a worthy upgrade and entry from a S9?
LMAO AT <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=432">7:12</a> HOW DID MY BRAIN IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE THAT WAS A CHICK-FIL-A
It&#39;s so convenient for privilidged people to just start searching for wireless headphones.<br><br>Some people had to wait 2 years before upgrading to a phone, now they have to save more to get a wireless headphone.<br><br>Still inconvenient since the technology for wireless stuffs are not that good yet.
I get its random but theres too much cheating accusations in major league baseball
I&#39;m an Apple fanboy and even I can admit that this is amazing.<br><br>Written on iPhone 11 pro :|

Do you really like the back of it !
Headphone Jack
Link that wallpaper plz
I had to pause it because I noticed his demonic shirt lol. How did he get be in the Illuminati?
Apple:Removes headphone jack<br>Community:How dare you!<br>Samsung:does the same <br>Community:Meh it’s fine<br><br><br><br>Like srsly I understand ppl like Android (so do I) but be fair!
Had this note 10 plus , I had issues 1,battery ,2, finger print sensor ,3, color shifts from blue to light pink . Am back to S9 plus
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=435">7:15</a> How did my fatass know that brick building was Chik Fil A
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=321">5:21</a> 😂😂😂
From someone who loves both iPhones and Samsung notes....<br>USB c headphones come in the box....but wired headphones in general are effectively out. Have you ever tried the Samsung buds? Convenient to use, stay in.<br>Higher refresh rates sound superfluous to me, screens and content looks HD enough.<br>I got 7 hours of on screen time yesterday. Lots of people don’t like to go by this, but I was on the phone absolutely loads ( my iPhone X and Samsung s9 both only got 3)<br>Negatives - as phone isn’t flat, using the pen to draw on the screen whilst leaning on it is difficult. Gestures are strange.
I want it but my note 9 is still working fine. Might hold off and maybe the note 11 will be out by then... also yeah those are all gimmicks, but it&#39;s fun to have them available.  I use my s-pen a lot, specifically for drawing.
I feel like Marques has been paid off by One Plus...
where can i find this WALLPAPER??????????????
Illuminati Comfirmed
Note 10 plus is a beast
Yeah your whining about everything😂.<br>The phone is crazy! Salute to Samsung for the 10+
Peace.
Ugh my Note 9 is starting to get burn in and I was really hoping the Note 10 would keep the headphone jack since I have an older car 😔
What is your permanent phone
The Note 10 plus looks tiny in his hands. 😂😂😂
Watching on my Samsung Note 10+ now 😁😁. Love this device ❤😍😘😗😙😚⚘🍷🍺
I want a link to buy a Note 10 Plus phone from Qualcomm with a capacity of 512 5g from Amazon, can you thank that?
No headphone jack so deal-breaker. Definitely not going to buy this one
In my country the note 10+ is jus available in aura black and aura glow
This or pixel 4 xl?
Any wireless headphone recommendations?
Screensaver??
Why get wireless headphones when you can just use a usb-c converter.
My God, your really hate Samsung phones lol
Hollerin from my s6
No PUN intended....
wait.. 2 years agot if im not wrong i saw a note 8 have 5 hours screen on time and it was considered bad..
I want to thank you for a wonderful review. I&#39;m thinking about upgrading 3 phones to this phone on Verizon Wireless. I&#39;m going to need Verizon Wireless to help me get the 3 lines upgraded but I have decided to go with this due to your extensive review. 🧔🏿✊🏿💯 Five Stars man. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I’d totally forward and rewind YouTube with the S pen if I could with air gestures
Alumnati shit go to hill unsubscribe

Hi, there is a sale deal on microsoft for note 10 plus from $800 if you pay in cash. Is this a good deal ?
A prefer a cheap reliable phone, and a good Linux laptop :) That&#39;s just how I roll...
This phone has terrible cam lol all those pics he showed were crap<br><br><br><br><br><br>Oh wait..... I&#39;m watching at 240p
Nice
<b>qwerty</b>
I&#39;m glad and lucky to have both phones the Note 9 and the  Note 10 plus. I get to choose which one to use as my daily driver 😀👍
Tried it. Loved it. But nothing works as seemless as the IPhone.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=439">7:19</a> you know that using a smartphone in a car is illegal while driving, right? So did you break the law? To take a pic on ur note 10? Explain
I dont know why, ive been ios user for 10 years, and now i bought the note 10 by accident not really, I&#39;m not feeling very comfortable with the android system I was thinking going back the the ios i used to have the xs max, since the iphone 11 pro max is not much of a big change, i decided to try something new, different something i never done before but im still thinking of buying iphone when it comes on september 2020 what do you think guys?
Should I get a note 10 plus or galaxy s10 plus?
It seems like Marques shirt is getting more attention than the phone🤣
where can i find the wallpaper at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=183">3:03</a>
I really just wanna know where that background come from tho, and wat the name of it is...
I just realised they got rid of the heartrate sensor wtff!?!?!?
Had this phone for 2 weeks today dose so much more then i need or can handle but like it a lot the only thing that I don&#39;t like abt it is that the location of Volume buttons i hv a wallet case with kick stand and when in action it would be great if button was on other side
Marques, especially since you’re such an influential YouTuber with a large follower-base, I feel like you need to have a greater responsibility with what you say because lots of people will blindly listen to your words and take it at face value. I think you need to stress that these are YOUR opinions in the video. As in, instead of making it sound like everyone will experience the same difficulty, you should emphasize that you’re not a Note user, never really have been, and therefore, you will definitely have some bias when reviewing it. You did mention a few times that you “personally” would not ……. but I still think you should mention that you’re not a Note user, and therefore, you don’t really understand nor appreciate the platform in general. <br><br>That being said, for one, I actually enjoy all the buttons on the left side. In the chaotic times we live in, it allows for you to double-tap to quick launch the camera with your third finger, take a video/picture with your index finger, and then turn the phone off with your third finger again, all in one smooth movement. Very discreet. You wouldn’t need to shift your grip to place your thumb on the power button anymore. So I don’t know what the issue is. This is the second video where you brought it up.<br><br>Also, what do you mean the speaker isn’t exactly great? I agree more with Unbox Therapy that the speakers are actually pretty good. The sound comes out through multiple speakers in the phone. One at the top, and one at the bottom, to give you a stereo-experience. In addition, due to the extra speaker, it’s actually VERY loud. I’m talking 90% quality compared to iPad Pro loudness (that’s right, I’m not a Samsung fanboy, I’m unbiased and buy whichever product gets made the best).<br><br>Also, just to get this on record: as Americans, we should NEVER buy Chinese phones like Huawei and OnePlus out of principle. It’s well known that Chinese phones, like their government, are dishonest, and disrespect your privacy and your personal data like location data. The reason why Huawei is so strong is because their government pumps in lots of money to try and compete with the world. Regardless, the notion that my personal info is being leaked to the Chinese government makes any Chinese phones a huge turn off, and it should for you too. I think if you keep up with Taiwanese news (why would you, you’re not Chinese/Taiwanese), you’ll find out that China does a lot of shady sh*t that doesn’t even get mentioned on American media such as purposely sending Chinese people to go to HK/Taiwan to increase the chance of a successful voting for pro-Communist parties or send spies to spy on Google (which is why US banned Huawei to begin with btw). To that end, even though the fingerprint scanner is faster on the OnePlus (great phone btw, I would never buy it), is it safe? Is the fingerprint even secure? Is the reason it’s so fast because it doesn’t even do a good enough security check on your fingerprint before it just unlocks the phone? Also, where is that fingerprint data stored? China? I feel like you should do better research on the security between fingerprint scanners. After all, you have more resources than the average phone user, and I mean...this is what you do for a living.<br><br>Also, you said that even though you’re just nitpicking at this point because it’s a phone of a thousand dollars, what decent phone that you can buy safely in America doesn’t cost a thousand dollars nowadays? Keep in mind, China phones are not an option so you can’t say OnePlus.<br><br>I think we all know that between iPhones and Notes, which one is by far worth the thousand dollars as long as you’re not biased. IPhone 11 Pro Max only come in 64 GB storage at base model, compared to 256 GB on the Note 10+ base model. IPhones 11 Pro Max have 4 GB ram compared to the amazing 12 GB on the Note 10+. Also, 6.5 inch display on the iPhone 11 Pro Max compared to 6.8 on the Note 10+. Like, how is this even a contest? They COST THE SAME!!! If you want the 256 GB storage iPhone 11 Pro Max, you pay 1249 dollars! (I do admit that the iPhone 11 Pro Max made insane advancements and improvements this year though, and honestly, I was close to buying one. Amazing scratch-proof material, next-league waterproofing capabilities, and as shown by PhoneBuff YouTube channel, the battery capacity is just otherworldly.)<br><br>Same as with the fingerprint sensor, if you don’t know whether the zoom-in mic works as claimed, why not test it out? You clearly have the resources, way more than the average person, and viewers go to you for answers, so why not figure it out before shrugging your shoulders and saying you’re not convinced that it actually works.<br><br>Also, I’m gonna be real with you. Up until last week, I had no idea that the iPad Pro that I’ve been using for almost a year as a whopping 120 Hz refresh rate display. I don’t know what is with this obsession with higher-refresh rates. Your eyes can only see so fast, and no, the differences are NOT easy to see. Safari on the iPad actually doesn’t even support that 120 Hz, and only goes up to 60 Hz. In addition, I honestly couldn’t tell the difference if you hadn’t told me the numbers. After all, I’ve been using it for a year, and basically thought it was the same as my now-replaced Note 8. Why does the Note NEED 90 Hz? Why is refresh rate so important to you? I’m actually curious, not attacking you. <br><br>Finally, just because you don’t know how to use something properly, doesn’t make it a gimmick. It just means that it’s difficult for YOU to use, but not for everyone. The S-pen took incredible technological focus in order to make that work. Apple doesn’t even have a stylus (but it does have an incredible Apple pencil which I use a lot and love). To answer your question about how many developers would make SDKs for the air-gestures, “uhm, actually a lot?” Do you think Samsung developers are just going to sit around and let ONLY camera be the sole-app that takes advantage of these features? No, I don’t think so. I think it’s fully possible that Samsung will allow you to use gestures for other apps, like, you know, powerpoint? Letting you go through slides with a flick of a wrist? Why didn’t you talk about that in your video, Marques?
<b>When you can’t choose which colour you want:</b>
Interesting Shirt Choice.
It ain&#39;t all that. But it&#39;s pretty damn cool! I have it (x I made a little vlog.
nice one. ..  still got my old phone. .. love to fill it up with songs and education audio for study. Google ZillaTube, it works
Imagine the S pen hole doubled up as a headphone jack
Hahaha
Is this better than the iPhone 8 Plus that I have now? Should I upgrade?
I wish I could afford it
Love your videos  keep it up And GOD BLESS!!!!!!
yes 😍 I want this and  I feel like this colour is mermaid 🧜🏻‍♀️
Are you a member of illuminate...?
Does it have grenade mode
I&#39;m literally thinking of getting the s10+ instead of the note 10+ just because of the lack of the headphone jack
Here after this phone won the blind camera smartphone test
The Blues better
Great video. However, I want to purchase your 3rd eye shirt though... Where did you get it?
Did you say you give the battery an A and not a A plus, but other phones with greater or similar SOT are meh?
Watching this on my Note 10+ lol
Dudes out here dissing pixel 4 XL for a 5 hours SOT but when it&#39;s Samsung 4 to 5 hours is &quot;pretty good&quot; for the note 10?
Getting for Xmas!!
4-5 hours of screen on time for note 10 is pretty good. 5 hours for pixel 4 is just okay
you look like you are an apple fan but samsung will always beat apple
What wallpaper is that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=410">6:50</a> you forgot the TOF camera
Why is it called the S pen of its only available on galaxy note, but not galaxy S. Why not call it the Note Pen
Alright we get it you hate the note 10 plus
It&#39;s not the power button, it&#39;s the Bixby button.
So this is a phone right? Aimed at the business user right? I&#39;m just asking because like a typical millennial you said nothing about the actual reason it&#39;s called... Wait for it... &quot;À phone&quot;. Seriously nothing about call quality?
<b>Bring back the IR blaster in NOTE X11🤷‍♂️</b>
I can&#39;t explain how happy I&#39;am with this phone, it&#39;s so amazing!
I’m a phone fiend. 😣
no headphone jack is making me hate samsung
Its so.....shiny
yo what happened to your arm
Note 7 all the way 🔥🔥🔥
I cant find that wallpaper anywhere can someone help me out?
What&#39;s that wallpaper app?
Was watching this review, very excited until no headphone jack. Deal breaker
Nice man great phone and snapdragon
This is literally the loudest and clearest phone I&#39;ve owned tf you talking about
One major issue with the phone :  Strong vibration from the speakers even at lower volumes. It&#39;s very disappointing...
galaxy note 10 plus...support 5g? or its a different divice? thx
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=98">1:38</a> best moment hahaha
Can i get some link to the wallpaper that marques use? 😩
You guy are making to big of a deal of the 90hz refresh rate, I mean I&#39;ve never owned a smartphone with a 90hz or higher refresh rate, Samsung&#39;s display on the Note10 + looks just fine to me.
What happened to Ask MKBHD!?
Anyone having that wallpaper link ??? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=50">00:50</a>
The <b>speaker</b> is amazing!
my first note is the best one made!  love the 10+
Looks bomb🔥😍
I ordered this phone because I always go to kpop concerts in this is the best one to take videos and pictures with, coming from the note 8 which was also superb
Low-key I think since the s8 and note 8 they haven&#39;t really improved much bruh
A phone without a headphone jack doesn&#39;t work for me.
Can i have that phone pls<br><br><br>Do a give a way pls
Just swapped my note 9 for a 10+, taking 300 off my total payment for the phone. So I&#39;ve basically gotten a 800$ note 10+.<br><br>My main reason for upgrading is that after a year of constant use I&#39;ve noticed a significant decrease in battery performance and after the shitstorm I suffered from trying to replace my S7 battery I figured trading it in while it&#39;s still worth something is better than trying to repair it and have the back glass shattered by a batteries + employee.
It&#39;s lowkey ugly
Just  got this phone  on black Friday 500$ off sweet. And i have  the 5g
EVERY PHONE IS A FINGER PRINT MAGNET SO CAN WE IN 2019 STOP MENTIONING IT IN EVERY SINGLE REVIEW? IT&#39;S LIKE SAYING THE THE PHONE TURNS ON WHEN U PRESS THE POWER BUTTON....
The song in the intro?
Sooo....... Everyone gonna forget about the illuminate t shirt
Amazing review!
There is something I simply can&#39;t wrap my head around: After so many years doing note phones, why haven&#39;t they implemented an &quot;eraser&quot; feature to the other end of the pen like apple does ?!
Marques, your wallpaper sir? I’m digging it and would appreciate a link for it.<br>Thanks
Best phone ever.
👀😍Anyone noticed his sexy thighs @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=36">0:36</a>?🥰😏

As a musician, Audio Jacks are still important to be able to own one pair of headphones for all of the equipment that will never switch to wireless.
I miss HTC!!!!!!
Took away the great speakers and the head phone Jack. Deal breaker I&#39;ll stick with my 9
Can you please tell me the wallpaper you are using
Even the note 10+ looks small in this dudes hands
If Apple removed headphone jack, it is not at all a problem, it&#39;s future. But when Samsung did it, it was the biggest concern for him. You&#39;re getting biased nowadays.
Note 11: <b>adds headphone jack because of how much hate the removal of it is getting</b><br>Headphone jack: <b>you could not live with your own failure....where did that bring you....back to me</b>
yes you right it 60 Hrz  only and it is the main and big problem in 2019😠😠😠 bluddy samaung
Go to developers menu and you’ll find 90 herz refresh rate..<br>ar least it’s how it’s done on note 9
Rewatching this on my note 10 plus feels weird
I&#39;m waiting till it costs 700$ so i could buy it 😂
&amp; NO memory card slot.. i will never buy without
yeah, the &quot;air gestures&quot; feature is definitely a gimmick, but come on... it&#39;s a pretty sweet gimmick.. :-)
I want to buy a phone right now so wanted to ask which is the best phone to buy right now and I am confused  between Google Pixel 4, Note 10 plus, S 10 plus and I phone 11 pro. Please help me out here
<b>Why you rockin&#39; the 🔼 shirt, you part of the brotherhood?</b>
@MKBHD Why do you always shit on Samsung on their flagships, but never the same complaints on iPhone PRO MAX XFINITY INFINITY XXXL? Wheres dat 90 HERTZ brah!
That Intro! &lt;3
Note 10+ gets stolen*<br>Police: what colour was your phone?<br>Owner: Yes...
You said all the important stuff in like the last 30 secs of the video
Hey Marques, could you please tell me the wallpaper that you have used for this video on the OP 7 Pro(the lighthouse one). I&#39;d like to use it for my phone.🤗
<b>Wrong...definitely worth the upgrade  from  the Note9</b>
Hi there, Marques. Is it just me or is there something wrong about the Note 10 Plus&#39; photo quality? I am using my unit for almost a month now, and I am noticing that my photos are not as sharp as my two-year-old Note 8—the shadows and dark corners are either grainy or smudgy, even in daytime photography. And while using the ultra wide lens, some subjects (our limbs, for example) look ridiculously stretched even when the &quot;Ultra wide shape correction&quot; mode is turned on.<br><br>Is this common among Note 10 Plus phones or is this just my unit? 😰 Help.
I know  placs where for the 1000 it takes to buy this thing I could bang  100 hookers.<br>In the past many people died without ever fucking 100 people.<br>So what would you choose?
Am I the only one who literally never thinks about the 60hz until marques brings it up?
Marques, have you ever accidentally dropped a phone down dose stairs?
Same statement I been making for years, if it&#39;s not the best display than what is....not a oled or Samsung fanboy
but if you’re taking selfies from 100+ yards away and don’t wanna run yo ass off, you can use the s pen lmao
Sooo he buys phones for a living...
Absolutely a great phone!!!<br>All you got to do is get a headphone Jack connector just like iPhone.
Wallpaper link please!
I just checked the Samsung website and this phone is 649 bucks. Pretty much half the price since it dropped. My question is should I get this phone or wait until all phones are 5G
Love my note!!!
Apple:*remove headphone jack”<br>Samsung:Hahahaha thats so stupid fucking decision hahahaha<br>Samsung:<br>Samsung:We removed it too
4-5 hours on screen time?My Xiaomi mi 9T can 6-7.Good luck.
Hey Marques, where did you get that shirt brother? I need it :D
Once you see 90hz can&#39;t go back to 60hz. If never seen it you will be fine.<br>Skipping this year&#39;s note 10 plus due to that reason.<br>At $1100 there shouldn&#39;t be compromises as big as screen from the king of the screen makers Samsung
Is the gross rainbow finish the only option?
What wallpaper app do you use? You always have the best wallpapers
Wtf I couldn&#39;t watch this without an 18 second ad this is bullshit
&quot;What&#39;s up guys MKTHKLTNBHD here&quot;
Yo .. YOOOOO ... WHAT THE FUCK samsung... They removed GearVR support!!!! Man I was so excited for this fucking phone.
Refresh rate is within the settings. It’s the window animation scale  setting which should be set at 1.5 if I’m not mistaken. It compensates for the slower refresh rate. It’s fast as lightning. The 3 three options are 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5.
I absolutely fucking love your unbiased reviews. Subscribed
Nobody: <br>Literally Nobody:<br>MKBHD: I&#39;m literally nitpicking at this point 😅
Fam ur a fan of Apple we understand but the Samsung Note10+ is also amazing stop saying negative things about it .
I think I&#39;d buy a clear phone case for the note 10+ if I got it in Aura glow cause I still wanna look at that psychedelic unicorn vomit pixie fantasy madness.
The advantage of having a tech uncle or auntie or even a cousin: they can give you a free phone😂😂😂
Would love to see a parody vid of youtubers doing a Samsung phone review as if it were an apple product review.
Samsung: <b>removes the headphone jack</b><br>Everyone: <b>holy music stops</b>
At least the finger print scanner works while the screen is off unlike the oneplus
Someone help please but what is this wallpaper and where do I get it ?!?!?
What is the particular skin that he put on the phone..I know it&#39;s dbrand but not sure which particular material..Someone help
I prefer with the headphone jack. Are u listening samsung
My LG G2 had that audio zoom thing. It didn&#39;t work great, it seemed like it was trying to isolate the sound from the subject and block out what it thought was other noise sources. It usually got it wrong tho
sponsored by samsung
You and your title should be thrown out
Can someone tell me what Marques&#39;s daily driver is rn? Is he using the note 10+? Thanks
I got mine last week. Loved it!
Iphone is also 60hz u dumb fuck why dont u nit pick it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=53">0:53</a> walpaper link??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=283">4:43</a><br><br>&quot; So, on the subject of nit picking, the display. No pun intended&quot;<br><br>Like seriously 🙄
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=102">1:42</a> <br>Why not give them all the colours😂🤣
Secreen On Time is More than 8 Hours... i Think u Have Faulty Unit...
I&#39;m thinking about trading my S8 for thr Note 10+. Should I do it? Is the 60 hz display a deal breaker?
Can someone tell me what is that background called?Is it default for 10+? Or where you can get it
This is the phone I’m going to get :)
Which should I get: Note 10 plus or iPhone 11 Pro Max?
Watching this dude last of the reviews for the n10 plus. As usual his face tells the real story doesn&#39;t it. He hates that Samsung has released another monster. A superphone that is the note series.<br>He&#39;s never liked the note series much.<br>9 out of 10 reviewers loved the phone only this guy seems as if death has incurred him! 😂😂😂
Absolutely THE BEST video of yours in recent time...<br>And especially the intro music 👌
Where  can i find this note 10 wallpaper ?
The wallpaper is great, where could you get it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=370">6:10</a><br>Hey Marques! Is that a giant 90 hertz sore on your arm? <br>Marques: NO! its a giant note 10...................(sigh)<br>Marques: plus... SHUT UP!!!
Ahm.. can I ask a question please? How did you get that wallpaper in your note 10+? That&#39;s so dope. Can i get link from that?
Apple has left the chat
Ok but like imagine swiping up on tiktok instead of killing ur fingers
Why the fuck Illuminati t shirt?
&quot;Buy a book&quot;<br>😂😂😂😂😂
I feel like the &quot;half a beat&quot; you&#39;re stressing about for the fingerprint unlock could be fixed by toggling the display animations with the developer options.
People were drilling &#39;headphone jacks&#39; in their Iphones, after reading on the internet this would work.
Specs?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=285">4:45</a> What pun?
That shirt tho...for those that kno.
I wanted to get the auro black but i ended up buying the auro glow... cant wait for it to arrive... hopefully i get it this week
On my way to buy a note 10+ . Stoked a bit actualy
I don&#39;t understand how you can be pro tech and at the same time be so hell bent on headphone jacks. Its&#39; old tech bluetooth is real.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=585">9:45</a> ?????
Where is the regular note 10 video?!
Samsung slowly making there S-pens into a magic wand!😂
got to get the Js in the shot
Information about the wallpaper..? Anyone?
Nokia N95 <br>the best
We don&#39;t cut corners
Question from a lefty. Does anyone who is left handed have this phone and can you still use the s pen effectively with it all on the right ride like that?
Ok thank you. No headphone  no note..
Let me start by sayingGREAT channel!!! I got the note 10+ based on the tag line of this video. I wanted to use it before I watched the video u made. I agree with everything u said except the refresh rate. But the fact that my phone before this was the stylio 4, and you use the newest phones all the time so I&#39;ll defer to your wisdom lol. Anyway keep bring the tech M!!!! I&#39;ll keep watching!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=654">10:54</a> Definitely, all Samsung phones hang.
Even if the note 10 had  a 120hertz refresh rate  he&#39;d still use the pixel by default
Which phone is better for the average consumer, galaxy note 10+ or the iphone 11 pro max?
The sides of the phone is steel like the I phones  not aluminum
Iluminati spoted
If you dont want an s8 can you send me pls
I was checking the demo phone in shop after 15 mins it was superheated,can u tell me if it has overheating issues i am looking to buy it
From now i just watched every single NOTE&#39;s review MKBHD ever made just to watch their innovations &amp;.. DAMN SAMSUNG ❤️😍🤙<br>Always love for you SAMSUNG ❤️
Why you talking shit about the screen on time thus phone is capable of a lot longer than 4 to 5 hours sot
His Illumanti top is distracting 😂
Girlfriend:Babe, the Moon is so beautiful<br><br>Marques:But it isn&#39;t 90 hertz thou...
I wish they didn&#39;t get rid of the headphone jack ._.
惊艳的很，就是系统能细腻一点就好了
Change animations to .5 or off and you will see that the finger print reader is just as quick.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0rop9pE58&amp;t=371">6:11</a>   wtf is that on your right hand
Can you share the wallpaper you used for this video
Could you please tell me where are you downloading your Wallpapers please?
What&#39;s that wallpaper app called?
Just joined the note 10 plus crowd today with my upgrade. I&#39;ve been an s user for man years my last being the s8 and I&#39;ve been curious about trying out a note for a few years. First thing I noticed is how much I love the s pen. Not so much for its gestures although useful but its basic function on screen is something I didn&#39;t realise I preferred. Not only is it easy to get  use but its fucking fast and handling benchmarks like buttery with fantastic results. It&#39;s a powerhouse alright it&#39;s like a mini computer I love it.
Meh, this phone has wired earbuds. They just have USB C support rather than the traditional 3.5mm jack.
why mkbhd dont like Samsung?🤔
I was forced to use the S-Pen on my note 9 since I managed to break the Screen which made digitizer not work but I decided to use the S-Pen and that still worked. I used it for a month and I loved it even more lol
Note 10+ or Pixel 4 XL?
Note 9 ftw
Most versatile phone of 2019. Camera is even better after the October security update.
Nice shirt you wear there mate
What&#39;s up with the illuminati shirt?
Watching this on my Note 10+ and gotta say man that video quality you put out is crazy
Apple: the new iPhone 11 pro max is 5 hour longer. This is the biggest battery in any iPhone.<br><br>Samsung: we need to make a phone like a power bank battery.<br><br>Apple (2020): the new iPhone 12 is one day longer than the previous iPhone. <br><br>Samsung: 😐
Someone name the song at the beginning
Huawei Mate20 pro of last year had 40W charging. (in 2018)
Samsung note screen? Pixel 4 XL 90 hz screen? iPhone video and battery? If all camera pics feel close enough, which do you spend the day enjoying? Pretend they all cost the same on Black Friday! Help me please?
The Chad phone
US Govt: builds nuke<br>MKB: I do not like that colour... Just slap a D-brand skin on it
Oneplus 7pro has faster fingerprint reader while note seems to have a more smother fingerprint reader
Man every phone I have seen him review this year has a missing feature that he like which makes it fall short. I wonder what his best “overall” phone is for this year.
It just looks like something you&#39;d buy at 5 and below.
Excellent display...Aaaaand that&#39;s it.  Lmao.<br><br>I&#39;ll skip the Note 10+ for a better alternative. 😊
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT THEME OR APP THING HE IS USING CAUSE ITS NOT THE DEFAULT SAMSUNG!!!
Brownlee with Symbols and Shit, a nice way to get views and money and fame
I love mine
Did anyone notice the MKBHB Tshirt?
No one puts skins on they&#39;re phones
Does anyone else think the phones almost as gorgeous as him? 😍🤩
He really doesn&#39;t like this phone!
@Marques Brownlee what phone are you currently using
That blue wallpaper though? Where did you get that? Backdrops?
awesome
Is the fingerprint sensor supposed to stay on when you have the always on display on all the time?
&quot;Big glass phone.&quot;
How can 4-5hrs SOT be good for this phone, which is 60hz, but not so good for the 90hz 7 Pro???
When are you reviewing the Pixel 4 (XL)? I am literally waiting for that review to decide between the Note 10+ or the Pixel 4 XL. :)
Blood on your hand
Intro song name
Anyone knows where to get the wallpaper?
He forgot to mention the Samsung dex
Memos are awesUme
Hey Marques, what&#39;s the song at the beginning of this video?
I the 60hz thing is the only thing that made this phone a pass for me.
I got a s10 plus but the note 10 is beautiful🤩
What&#39;s that wallpaper he is using and or app?
Don&#39;t listen to this shmuck selling you old shyte with new money!  Reselling the Saumsung&#39;s crappiest ideas  again and again and never getting tired.  This phone is shytest of them all. They still have kept edges on Note series destroying real estate of the phone just because some a-holes at R&amp;D wanted to keep selling old shyte with a new label but for more money! You&#39;d be wise if you don&#39;t buy this crap.  Samsung destroyed note series after Note 5 because of some idiots in control. Not to mention, if you bought it with cash (more expensive), then forget about updates...lol....
I have noticed that when I buy samsung phone, I try to make the whole phone look and experience like Iphone... Apple time yo make changes!
Gimmick city 🤣🤣🤣
The lack of headphone jack really hurts. It&#39;s only the S-pen that really ties us onto this phone.
Bro I see your poppin notebook and your switch controller. I see u.
Is it wise to lay a phone on the table and start typing with camera&#39;s nowadays sticking out ?
Mkbhd<br>I want switch form note 9 to note 10 plus<br>Is it OK?<br>Plz help me out
what if the millennial&#39;s next lot of kids never have a phone with a headphone jack,,, like theyre dropping so quickly in flagship phones i wouldnt be surprised if in 10 years they just stop with the headphone jacks...
i love the colour situation on this (and the hauwei p30 pro),,, if colours like this keep coming out in the future im gonna be absolutely stoked but if they just have it for the 10,,, looks like that&#39;ll be my next upgrade in 3-4 years
first phone i Didnt plug when i go in bed
how did you injure your left elbow?
Dude where did you get your tshirt? 8ts awesome
Wallpaper on Oneplus 7 Pro?
The headphone jack is officially dead
Nice Shirt Marques <br>X Files theme plays
Best phone available!
