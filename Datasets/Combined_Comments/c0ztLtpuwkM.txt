Ludzie pizdy. Szczyle robią co chcą. A wyjebać w ryj i z buta zamiast uciekać przed frajerami.
Why didnt police arrests?
I am pretty sure if u deck one of them kids is instant jail for u their victim. Its a hard pass for me. I know the video is old but crime is still bad. Watch anything dated now, it’s mostly motorcycle mugging. Go somewhere else guys. I left my professional camera in a street vendors chair in mexico. The mans wife followed me 6 blocks to return it, she wouldn’t let me pay her a rescue fee either. Most islands in the Caribbean did the same to. There are places in the world you just don’t go or go with nothing expensive. I leave everything at home now, don’t even bother with the camera either. My clothes are the ones i bought cheap. Even in Cuba? Before it closed down? We gave the kids brand name clothes as gifts. I wore a sweaty shirt back to the cruise. The only scare we had was in one of the primitive villages in South America were a gang of kids and teens boxed us against a dead end. I swear god sent a cop, cuz we didn’t see him rolling out with his knight stick n saved us. Kid spit on us n ran like chipmunks. Cop told us straight up to stay in the city n not to ever fight cuz the other cops would arrest us. Village had this beautiful gothic church divided between christianity and their old gods. I regret not having the camera but i am lucky we didn’t have it. Huge market around it with roses , fruit n art. Very primitive housing. It looked like what u saw in fairytale books. Never seen anything like it. Just mind opening, seeing such beautiful n scary experience. The adults? Super sweet. Kids? Better watch what u bring.
Why all delincuents or most of them are black? Is it a coincidence or what? It happens in another countries as well 🤔
Why all black guy did that?
A rede globo eo psol eo pt diz que aqueles que estão assaltados são o milicianos,
No more cups on Brazil!
Pasti anak miskin
They got to feed their family every way mn <br>I blame the government
Wtf 🤬 still wonder why police don&#39;t take any measures against them
I think they need education because if they educated they would be very smart and no need to steal just help them not to kill them
Só eliminando mesmo

Police???? Never because corrupt
Y que tal si en vez de una camara fuera un fusil?
I see a lot of foreigners complaining that people don&#39;t help victims, that&#39;s true. They don&#39;t help because Mr Lula&#39;s own government supports these criminals saying that they are victims of society. That they can&#39;t be arrested just for stealing a cell phone to have a beer. as thieves as he is.
Isso só acontece no Brasil pois falta inteligência policial ou então é de propósito mesmo.... basta colocar policiais a paisana dando sopa atravessando a rua e quando virem assaltar o policial da frente, o policial de trás saca e enche de bala o ladrão.... sendo assim vai retirando um a um de circulação....
Y nadie hace nada,nadie ayuda a las víctimas. Vaya mierda
Tem que ficar um pessoal escondido, com tacos de baseball na mão, pra poder arregaçar esses &quot;meninos&quot;.
POS&#39;
Tem que linchar esses lixos
Começa assim depois entra para o PT 😂
Sou brasileiro, mas isso é para vcs edtrangeiros verem o lixo que está o Brasil. Não venham para essa verdadeira merda

Quer mudar isso ai é só todo mundo andar armado igual no Estados Unidos ai eu quero ver vai ser bala pra todos os lados zuera é só mudar as leis e triplicar a pena e quem for menor de idade pagar igual adulto só que o governo não faz nada a polícia prende e a justiça solta ai si vc mata um muleke desse na pancada ai vc vai preso entendeu a lei foi feita para beneficiar políticos e bandidos e não o trabalhador.
Esse vídeo ai é antigo 😂da um rolê no centro de SP hoje rouba idosos crianças e família dentro do carro é muito ladrão na rua os drogados rouba para sustentar o vício e bandido rouba para ostentar agora tem umas regras de audiência de custódia si não confirmar o flagrante o delegado libera e quem for de menor si tiver juntos com os maiores saem pela porta frente 😂😂😂😂😂

Que asco! Jamás iré a Brasil, jamás!!
Disgusting people....never change....no education, no jobs, no discipline no nothing...

Fkin beat them.
Where is the police visibility of this country!? If locals are scared, how much more the tourists! Thieves are beaten up by private citizens in my country even  minors that&#39;s why they are afraid to commit a crime vulgarly.
What a pathetic place
Games should be banned in this country.
Apakah tidak ada polisi?
Netizen fight back please!!! Calling all by stander prevent this from happening!!!
Where is the fucking police ??
It&#39;s a big shame for the country
Most pathetic country

Camera filming great but no protection or police there…. Pathetic. If one scumbag would mug me I would beat him till he can’t talk anymore.
stupid
such a crappy country.
Криминала не увидел. Прыткие, тупые  и наглые малолетние дебилы. Мусаров в Бразилии вообще нет?
Notice they all have a bottle that they seem to be drinking from. That&#39;s actually a solvent like paint thinner or any other substance that they can huff and get a high from.

Bad country no police 😁
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0ztLtpuwkM&amp;t=38">0:38</a> Now thats how you handle a thief
It&#39;s always the same kulur, always. Anywhere you go. America, Brazil,  UK. They are always the ones creating problems.
That’s one place off the bucket list
Where police???
Is this real
Rio de Janeiro is the worst city in Brazil, it has much safer and more beautiful places, for example Curitiba.
The fact these thief are not afraid and keep comming back at their victims is beyond me. Do that here in my country and you&#39;ll get beaten up by the crowd.
This motherfucker country with the poor government. Look criminals are robbing and no police. Fuck brazil
The situational awareness of some of these people is non existing
If Brazil becomes a communist country and makes the law cruel, <br>those criminals will be good people on their own. <br>Can you really say that&#39;s a country? It&#39;s really pathetic..

Waiting for musicians to beautify stealing now the way they beautifying drugs now. Western people are living in bubble thinking those musicians and tv people are not influencing much but reality is way way different. The Brazillians are high on drugs and they need lots of money to keep the drug flowing. Bring a change guys and boycott those stupid young influencers.
Try this in my country..we would burn your alive no cap.Nigeria
Women need men to protect them so women should obey men, this video is a prime example
Strong Successful Modern Women can&#39;t protect themselves and need proper security lol. Living in their own bubble they think this is how world operates.
UNICEF comes in favour of these bastards

Why do people let them go? Surely you can&#39;t use more violence and pain like finger/wrist breaking ?
Love diversity
This is what happens when you have high fertility rate
These thugs don&#39;t like Bolsonaro, a tough president, against crime. The Brazilian Left that makes life easier for these bandits. Against the good citizen.
So the idea here is to just keep watching these thugs doing their thang on the streets. How’s that helping anyone?
We need Shariah Law in Brazil and these thieves would not even dare to think about stealing
Good thing in the us you can pop them with the 9mm
Brazilian police are sliping,

Brasil is one of the worst country in the world!If your a tourist and If you have plan to go to brasil, dont do it. Its looks like hell in there.
This is not safe countries for the travellers , the law enforcement will do nothing for peace and order of the busy urban community.
Kill them all this country need duterte!!!
It&#39;s also forbidden to be naked in the Philippines, especially in public areas and smoking in public areas. If you&#39;re seen, you&#39;re in the police&#39;s hands, because here in the Philippines, if you&#39;re a snatcher, a local will beat you up, and you&#39;ll go straight to the police, that&#39;s up to them.<br>That&#39;s my famous salvage🤣
especially when snatcher is famous, life will be thrown away hahaha, goodbye to the world, just throw yourself on the road or river
Idiots

Very annoying!
I have seen crime in many countries, but this one here is out of control. Where are the police.<br><br>You don&#39;t even need to invade Brazil when you have crime like that. Its own people are finishing up this country.

Thirsty shiesty little niggas
There is drugs in their water bottles
Okay i got it :D I am not going to Brazil :D
The messed up part is that the cameraman is probably watching them to protect them from retaliation.

Fun fact Brazil has an extremely high rate of unsolved homicides.

Brazil = a country of no old man
I would have been walking with a knife and fucking stabb them all <br>Little fuckers
Why do people take everyone just to see in my country if there are people like that, they get hit by a lot of people
If you saw someone with a flip flops ,just run or hold your shit hardly
Those living in the favelas think they are entitled to earn whatever people in the urban have. No remorse and no guilt whatsoever as they blame everyone with better financial stability for their misfortune.<br><br>There is a major difference between being poor and being scum of the earth.
Brazil is a bad Country 🤨😡
First dude just shrugged it off like he’s used to their shit
if this is hapand in india the kids will die before the police come the public will allready kill them by own

All these filthy animals should be executed 😡😡😡
Un balazo a cada uno, nadie los llora.
Thats why I dont like to visit Brazil, fun fact, the farther of these thieves are police  some of them , once they caught they can easily out of jail.
Brazil is not on ordinary place.
I&#39;ve been looking for a place to practice my overhand right and round house kicks. I hope the cops there permit it.

This video change my mind to visit to brazil thanks 👍🏻
Bad country.
Ugly brazil

Ain&#39;t going to Rio... if these fk&#39;s were in my country they would be shot by the police but first by their parents<br>We fear our parents more than anyone, disrespect to our family is the biggest crime<br>These little b!tches have guns around the corner if you fight back or chase
It&#39;s 2021 , still like this in this fucked-up street ?
Where&#39;s the video of these kids getting shot in the face?
They all need a good kick in
SO UNSAFE TO TRAVEL IN THERE! I know most countries have these, but with this one?! Oh my. I will never wish to travel in that place. Where are the police by the way?! Or the people in there helping you? Just merely by stranders?! What a place!
Diversity is our stench.
Brazil police is semlike animals y no shot
Tiktok in public : NOooooooooo
It&#39;s a really fucking country
The photographer is also a criminal, why doesn&#39;t he call the police and why is the police not there?

I am appalled by the indifference showb from the people around.
ถ้ามีงมาทำที่ไทย ไม่ตายก็พิการอะ
Coming soon to an American city near you. Honestly these type of things would be happening in the US too if we weren’t such a police and welfare state. It already is happening in certain neighborhoods in cities in NY, Chicago, LA, and San Francisco.
Lol city lol
Ainda bem que aqui em Santa Catarina não tem esse tipo de coisas, Só Rio de Janeiro mesmo
it&#39;s so shameful.
From this video on I will hate ALL BRAZIL 🤮🤢💩🇧🇷
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0ztLtpuwkM&amp;t=320">5:20</a> she just gave her phone and walked away lol
Should steal in Saudi Arabia.will find out how much fun it is looting innocent people .applauding give bad name to a beautiful country
The brazilians don&#39;t even help the tourists when they&#39;re assaulted... what a shame.
I heard they have execution squads at night where the police come and just flat out kill them....
<b>No words can describe how much I resent and disgust this kinds of humans</b>
One thing for sure is no one not running up on me so they will definitely leave with some bullet that&#39;s if they could leave and all who want too talk about young they know what they are doing
where polize? kill all robbery stupid
disgrace the country
Damn i wanna punch them 😤
Os poliça podiam ter o direito de atirar nesses malucos, nem que seja com bala de borracha
Busted up country.
Like a hyena 😀
Poverty sucks
In Indonesia thief is enemy for everyone. People will punch them before police come
Absolutely disgusting
Where is the police de sécurité
national lier dolls and national useless governments make grow those people
advice for that teenager don&#39;t rob the drug dealers or you&#39;ll get shot in the hand
i hope that i was walking there and have a silenced  pistol 😊
Can you defend yourself with deadly force in Brazil like you can in America<br>This would be considered assault and robbery,, not what ever a picpocket charge is
Can&#39;t help but hear the Aladin song        &quot;street rat&quot;
tantos gringos falando mal do Brasil hahahaha. Dizendo que somos selvagens e não temos respeito pela vida. Muitos deles, árabes, indonésios e filipinos, nos sugerindo cortar as mãos desses menores ou até mesmo queimá-los vivos. Mas claro, somos nós que não temos humanidade. Também há uns americanos dizendo merda, como se o país deles não tivessem cometido tamanhas atrocidades, na Libia, Afeganistão, Iraque e etc. E por último, outros latino-americanos de países tão violentos quanto Brasil hahahaha. Enfim, essas pessoas criticam o Brasil mas no país delas coisas tão ruins quanto acontecem.
Not a single police passed by atleast 1nce in any 1 of those videos...now I understand why the crime constantly
very shameful for Brazil.<br>these craps can injured them also
Those criminals are like hyenas.
JAJAJAJAJA es encerio? osea se dejan quitar sus pertenencias con tanta facilidad? aqui en Venezuela ya muchos de esos ladrones estuvieran muertos.
Fuck 🐶🐶🐶
Never ever got to Rio
In india these guys are surely bitten to death by the public around. If get caught
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0ztLtpuwkM&amp;t=92">1:32</a> water
If this situation happened in my country especially in my region...the rubber i will slice
Kung dito yan sa pinas bugbug yan
Hope this bad people will repent and find the miracle
These teens are so stupid yet lazy. They even rob earphone? Gosh I really want they capture those shit get run over by a bus
everybody is thefts
just shot them in head
Fuck brazil
They&#39;re so intrepid as if lawlessness exists there, the government should create awareness and rehabilitation. for these misguided kids, if you can host Olympics you can&#39;t cry for fund deficiency for this much needed cause which puts bad name of Brazil internationally.
Esse pessoal acha que no Brasil só tem roubo (não que isso seja verdade) mas também precisa cadê o respeito?
Real athletes are seen mostly outside the stadium 😂😂😂
Scumb people
Why this Kids didnt get run over? I mean it would be justified in my eyes
Teenager brazil like dog shit
If I can One Of them.. I Will Like Too Beat them Up So Bad. they Will Forget About Stealing..
just bring a taser
If law accept cut hand person who steal, than we will be in safe.
Kenapa pada diem aja sih
Reached in the bus and broke the phone then gave it back 💀
How do these kids not get shot over this all the time? Lol do they only target tourists?
Bolsonaro: More ppl I can blame my own incompetence on :)
Dangerous Country
Where&#39;s the murder
Those bottle in their hand seems to be the issue
This is only in Rio de Janeiro, if this city were removed from the country Brazil would be perfect!  I live in Curitiba, in the southern region of the country and I have NEVER been robbed or threatened!  FUCK RIO DE JANEIRO And the northeast region, another shit
İt is simple just kill of them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0ztLtpuwkM&amp;t=525">8:45</a> lil bro separated from his squad he would’ve got his jaw shook if that was me😂👎
Wher is the police?
If I&#39;m this cameraman who always see this situation, I will use sniper to shoot every thief per day of incident
di brazil patung yesus doang yang gede kelakuan orang2 kek babi ngepet
I know it sounds cruel but all these should be locked in prison for ever. They are of no use whatsoever to society and I don&#39;t think they will ever show any proper social behavior. Yes I know they are poor as hell but there are poor people all over the world. Stealing is not justifiable..
as a brazillian teen i just want to beat their ass
Pathetic kids
Wlay naka badlong ana nila Basta naa na diri sa cebu patay jud nag mga bataaa mga yawa kaau pisti 😠😠😠😠 Ang mga pulis dira wlay paki alam promise
Stupid people
if someone took my fcking phone btch they dead as hell...
Brazilian citizens should do something with their fucked up president and his corruption. Brazilian people deserves a better system and lifestyle. Not this shit.
In Indonesia, if there&#39;s a pickpocket, the citizen will catch the pickpocket and wait for the police to arrest the pickpocket
This place looks fucking scary dude..
Too lazy to have a better work.
I wanna visit this place someday
Give that camera man a sniper
So no power of police
but who is making the video?
Brazilian teenagers represent Brazil 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Stab or shoot somebody!!! I would end up in jail.
Huehuehue
the definition of a hotspot
Shit country
Brazil is just a big meme lmao. Joke of a country.
Who is filming? These scoundrels&#39; boss?
What the fuck with brazilian police
If they same happens in India, international media would have shown this again and again on their news to give india a bad name
Lesson 1: Don&#39;t wear a necklace in Rio.<br>Lesson 2: Stay away from teenagers.<br>Lesson 3: Start fighting, because they are not into it.
Fun fact: this video was recorded from the window during only a day
the people are like a flock of sheep. rob one the rest like rams look. no one to intercede for the weak
Brazil need a Chief minister like Yogi Adityanath. He is the CM of Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh was also having crime issue in 4 year back it was called crime capital of India. But after Yogi Adityanath got elected for CM in UP crime rate‚ Rape got decreased First 16 months of Yogi Adityanath govt: Over 3,000 encounters, 78 killed.<br>3,026 encounters till July 2018. In these encounters, 69 criminals were gunned down, 7,043 criminals were arrested, and 838 criminals sustained injuries. The letter claims that in the same period, 11,981 criminals had their bail canceled and surrendered in <a href="http://courts.an/">courts.An</a> analysis of the data shows that during this period, an average of six encounters took place every day, with 14 criminals arrested. Also, at least four criminals were killed in encounters every month
That&#39;s why I hate brazil &amp; there Law sistem also Brazilian President😡
Since the police don’t do shit, I think it’s alright to shoot some of them
Junk
Fun fact: Gabriel jesus was also one of them
City of god realize version:)))
Stupid thieves. Put them all in jail. Cut off their hands.
Seem they need sharia law there . Because I’m sharia law they cut your hands for stealing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0ztLtpuwkM&amp;t=322">5:22</a> what did I saw this ???🤣🤣🤣
This thieves should try this in india. We will show them what mob lynching is called.
Sao Paulo?
These theives should do this in Saudhi Arabia 😂😂
How to identify them? - they&#39;re shirtless.
horrible place
horrible place
These bastards need to be shot or at least the general public needs to team up and beat the living shit out of them.
Wow what a shithole
I used to think that Brazil was a good country and a safe place
If you haven’t  watched the movie « city of Gods » you can’t appreciate this video
Why people still walk with neckless on crime and dangerous area??
Give me an AWP…
After watching this HELL NO am I stepping foot in this country.
bope
SHIT COUNTRY I HATE BRAZIL
OMG this shit is happening at Daylight.<br><br>Why other people don&#39;t catch them?
Brazil can be very hard to navigate! I remember being on a business trip and was wearing an expensive pair of loafers. I was sitting outside at a restaurant table on the street and being that i had been walking for most of the day my feet were killing me. I slipped my loafers off under the chair I was at and I guess when I was eating someone had seen the errant shoes and reached under my chair and nicked them right from under me! It was not fun getting up from my chair and realizing my shoes had gone missing. Quite embarrassing leaving in just my socks.
Where is the police?
Shamful country
Welcome to Rio de Janeiro👋
Very stupid country
this is how I lost a thousand dollars... I was gonna buy a bottle of water with that money
I live in Brazil but I have plans to move with my sister to live our lives in Lisbon. We can&#39;t live here no more.<br>Brazil is a country of fear. We can&#39;t live without dignity. Is not a good country to live, our live is very bad and hard.<br>And many other problems: corruption, poverty, narcotraffic, expensive taxs, poor education.<br>I want to be husband and father. How can I have a wife and sons in this type of country?<br>I want to be happy with my sister in Portugal. ❤️
Ai quando chega perto da morte, vem pedir perdão á Deus
i would knock them out if i were there
Aya ven que roban y pocos actúan.😤<br>Acá en Colombia hace rato lo fueran corretedo y linchado

What are the police &amp; govts doing here ?
islam is the best, low criminal
This is the only reason they starve till death
Will never visit Brazil after seeing this.
Omg sem to sem pakistan 😂😂😂
Meu País ❤🇧🇷
typical
Free boxing membership in Brazil 😎
This is forest
i guess even brazil police would be part of those robbers, thats why they have guts to steal in daylight. Police must be taking money from them to keep their robbery business booming in brazil.
Brazil is a really shitty country
I wonder why people stand up to watch the criminal, why don&#39;t they protect themselves from thieves?
Thank God for security and safety in Saudi Arabia as there are dealing with thieves by cutting their hands 💛🤲🇸🇦✋🏻
الحمدلله على نعمة الأمن والأمان في السعودية 🇸🇦 💛🤲
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0ztLtpuwkM&amp;t=321">5:21</a> hey what happened there🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡
If this happen in India, they would be badly lynched by the hot headed public But seems like Brazilians are pretty OK with it.
This country is not safe to visit.
Brasil needs the Taliban Anti-Thieves-Squad (TATS) to sort out these parasites. Islamic Sharia Law will work wonders for Brasil.
It&#39;s bad where police.

You don&#39;t know brazil very much if you knock some kid he will go and bring his older brother with a gun so you&#39;re fucked up
Umm...Is it save to visit Rio?
I still could not believe something like this possible, those robbers are behaving like they are shopping in a shopping mall

So shame....🙄🙄

That&#39;s what I am talking about !!! You try to steal from me , you get some left and rights !!! ( That&#39;s My Purse , I Don&#39;t know You ) 😁
<b>Podia cair um meteoro no Rio de NOJEIRA!</b>

I am sorry. I don&#39; t understand the situation there but why are there no police officers around ? There have to be like 5 officers around there or just a police car. It can already intimidate the criminals enough.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣

All tourists must have a gun there and fire without hesitation.

Viram? A maioria são brancos.
Countries don&#39;t have rules.
Puto asco de pais en general
Po meu na moral , Como sempre gringo só faz merda , essas coisa só acontece perto da periferia , não no Brasil todo ... os cara são muito burro mesmo
Worldless = Cạn lời       from vietnam 😐
Gta Brazil
No futures for these kids and feels bad for them.  The uneducated and poverty made them like a bunches of shameless human being.  Sad for Brazil.  USA should take over South America and create a more prosperity and a best place to live.  Only Americans can achieve that greatness.  South Americans cannot do anything good.
what the fuck here happened🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
I like how all the comments ignore the most obvious thing.
Stupid country
i&#39;ll still go cause them lil rats will never mess with somebody like me. if they ignore common sense and try to snatch something from me they can&#39;t out run me and i&#39;m slamming them to concrete with no sympathy.. they&#39;ll never get up again.
Garbage city

Argentina se acerca
Street kids. Abandoned by parents. The containers they&#39;re sniffing out has glue inside. They are rounded up and shot by the police on a regular basis. The cops consider them cockroaches. There was a movie made about this.
Someone’s gotta do something to fix all the shit and scum that is Brazil
This is shame brazil is a dangerious contry
Brazil =  we have  highest  rate  crime                south Africa = hold my  beer 😌😌

ពួកហែងបើនៅស្រុកអញវិញ ប្រហែលទក់សាច់ដូចប្រហិតហើយ
After watching this I am happy that atleast India is not like this ..... I dont know how BBC, CNN and other broadcasting agencyies have shown India to rest of the worl. I have seen beggers in Delhi asking for money from Foriegners but I have never seen them  trying to snatch or ever stood like a goon or mafia in front of them. Even beggars are innocnet in India with a good law and order. Next time make slum Dog millioner movie based on western countries. I am sure they too have slums for which they are perfect to hide buy running propoganda against Asian countries .....
I will never visit brazil, what a shit thief country
One atomic bomb would be nice
Why do they all have water bottles 😂
노예제도 제발 ㅋㅋ
real Ghosts &#39;n Goblins
Lol? Why nobody cares? If all of the people kick they ass hard... they wont show up again... like in my country... sometimes beat them half dead... that scare em...
They must implement a policy that for every thief to be caught, 1 finger will be cut or remove.
Person who is filming this...should have been a sniper...pow pow..headshot 😜
remember THIS IS RIO not Brazil
If you did this in Ethiopia never mind the police, the people alone will kill you 💀
Que asco dan estos ladrones, unas gana de cagarlos a palo

It&#39;s funny how some people don&#39;t even react. It seems so casual like it&#39;s just a normal daily activity.
where are the police? Maybe sleeping?
I bet everyone on this comment thread watched Aladdin and rooted for the security guards  vapid monsters y&#39;all are
Just stab these fuckers it doesn’t look like anyone else cares what happened to either of you
Brothel country. Brazil is a thief
Try to do this shit in malaysia... i swear to god you don’t have face anymore
7 ????
these things only happen in Rio, a place where 99% are vagrants and thieves. in other states this does not happen, definitely the fault of brazil being frowned upon is because of this garbage called Rio de Janeiro, the shame of the country and represents everything that is bad in the world. in short: you can visit Brazil calmly if you don&#39;t get close to this rubbish state, know that all Brazilians are also afraid to go there. there you find thieves, arrogant people and a horrible thief accent and if you are there and need to be sure you are going to try to steal your feces.
they destroy their own country lol
It&#39;s a good thing that the cameraman knows that brazil is going to hell
Brazil nice but dangerous
Corruption &amp; crime do not go to Brazil! Or wherever this shitty place is
왜 저럼
Que vergonha desse país lixo parece que os  brasileiros acham que um dia o político corrupto que eles idolatram vai mudar essa situação
If it&#39;s happen in my country, the victim will yell &quot;thieves&quot; at them, and people around will catch them out.<br><br>It&#39;s sad, they&#39;re do nothing about it and that kids pickpocketing freely in broad daylight
where is karma?

<b>seeing that one guy actually fight back and beat one of em up made me so happy</b>

Remember, this is bit on the entire brazil, gramado is not like this, (gramado is beautiful, the best thing i’ve ever seen in my life) just rio de janeiro is like this
يشفط غرا ويسرق ملاعين ياخيي😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💔
Sad but true...
Brazil<br>Argentina<br>Italy<br><br>Don&#39;t go
And people does nothing, they must kill those fucking. &quot;childs&quot;
que vergonha alheia .
você estrangeiro, fique longe do Rio de Janeiro.
just dont go to India + Africa + Brazil
This is what poverty does to you.

This is so fucked up.. In my country if u want to die a quick death then do that!
street bullying
Rio the beautiful city... but i can&#39;t visit there because I&#39;m a small, week Asian guy.
Brazil needs to go back to the old days where thieves would get their hands dislocated/cut off
Despite the level of crime and issues related Brazil is not just this aspect.<br>For those who would like to visit Brazil don’t get discouraged looking these images. <br>And then Brazil is not just “Rio”, but a huge and very beautiful country with lovely people.
Reamente a policia de vitória da conquista e nota 10 porque se um muleque desse fazer isso e 10 viatura em 5 minutos e ai a bala come
Actually i want to go to Brazil to knock all of them
Putos drojos de mierda pónganse a trabajar pinches huevones
Son bien pendejos por no defenderse niaser nada x ke sifuera Aki en México ya les ubieramos dado una madrisa chida no manchen de fiendanse
Where the Police? 🤔
The guy who filmed this is a hero after this was shown to the world quickly the government arrested all these thefts and now we have decent police patrols on Rio downtown. Just show us that all the problems in our country could be solved if the government wanted to.
Le Brésil est un pays dangereux,les voleurs sont armés,les drogues etc...<br>Ne visiter pas le Brésil vous risquez votre vie et merci.
Pura pinche basura, los deberian de matar o mocharles las manos o los pies, esos perros van a crecer y seran peor basura
Worst thing is that people just stand there
This is brazil ... then Worse country
Worst fellows... What government doing ...
Crazy if i just think to go Brazil 🇧🇷
I would kill them

Rio de janeiro is dangerous place. more theives.  😱 I thought rio de janeiro is the best city but i was wrong. 😌 Keep safe everyone specialy the tourist.  Hays! 😔

Humilhação é o sentimento que transborda de ver os comentarios aqui . Infelizmente um video com 54 milhões mostrando a tristeza que é o Brasil,vai muito além de copacabana e Rio de Janeiro e sim não adianta querer passar o pano esse é o meu país
Denles plomo

Yo siempre llevo una navaja cuando salgo ::
Eu rezo pra eles tromba um polícial e toma 3 tiro e morrer não ia fazer falta Memo um dia isso acontece e vai ser o dia mais feliz do rj pegando um por um
I&#39;m brazilian and i confirm this for you, RIO DE JANEIRO IS THE WORST PLACE TO TRAVEL IN BRAZIL. If you want to travel another beautiful places in Brazil go to: Brasília,Maceió,Pernambuco,Rio Grande do Sul,Amazonas,Bahia,Minas Gerais,Jalapão and Sergipe. Rio de Janeiro is 100% robbers,scams and drug dealers. Nice travel and good luck ;). <br><br>Salve pro Brasil porraaaa🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
WTF they dont have any police in that area?
in my city, they will dead in 1 week shoot by police.  no need arrest.
Metalo preso a todo eyo
Yes Rio is a dangerous city but I think that if you want to visit a city like this you don’t wear stuff like necklace and bracelets. It’s obv the people that live there have nothing and never to lose. Adapt to the city that you visit
這是什麼地方？治安那麼差
And everyone keep asking me &quot;why do you always carry a knife?&quot; hehehe, I am waiting.
Fck Brazil bruh
Porq nadie agarra esos ladrones
The people there are so stupid.. <br>They won&#39;t help?get a life

A alguien no le dio ganas de darles un 👊
Esses fela deveria levar umas 3 bala na cara pra para de ser otário
I&#39;m Canadian and I can guarantee that not all of Brazil is like this. I&#39;ve been to Florianopolis, Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte and felt safe in almost every place I went there. Even Rio de Janeiro can be quite safe for foreign tourists, but only if you stay in places like Ipanema, Copacabana or Barra de Tijuca (favelas are NOT a tourist attraction). I&#39;d definitely like going to Gramado or Porto de Galinhas next time.
Solo de ver lo descarados que son dan ganas de pegarles una buena golpiza para que aprendan
O
Y la Policía de brazil donde están.????
Im brazilian and i hate the brazil because of this i want tô life in america
