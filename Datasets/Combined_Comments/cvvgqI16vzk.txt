Sonakhshi is dumb. Who cares?
They all are anti government so what do you expect
No politician/Farmer/Trader/Middlemen/Media/Fake secular has told till date what is bad in this law, but still these kind of anti Hindu Newspapers (compare their reporting of Hindu and Non Hindu festivals) are driving the agenda of anti Modi because they are indebted to congress dynasty.<br>Hindustan Times editorials are written by Barkha Dutt, Chidambram, Karan thapar Rajdeep  etc etc all are anti Modi and everyone knows it.Many of them lost their jobs because of Fake Reporting now you yourself judge level of this newspaper and their hidden agenda.
How can ordinary former stay for rally ,it is impossible without money and food  more than a month  in delhi
rihana jo chahti thi wohi hua....now see everyone is talkingüòÇüòÇüòÇ
90 percent of supporters and farmers don&#39;t know what&#39;s 3farmer bill.thats the problem
Tapsee pannu is too woke inko Sweden mei janm lena chahiye tha
I believe in Modi,if there would be congress in power then they would have killed thousands of farmers in 26th of Jan
Inki dukaan band honi hi.....
If we were to do polls on the most famous nd loved politician in India rn... it will be MODI.<br>The more these leftist will push... the more popularity modi will gain.
Both Sonakshi and Tapsi are brainless. Let&#39;s have an open debate on farm laws, they won&#39;t even be able to name the three laws correctly. But this time they are not against any govt, they are against INDIA. They will pay for this.
It starts with fight for human rights, ends with naxalism or riots.
Stop giving importance to these entertainment people! They are good for entertainment.  Pls keep your political opinions with yourself . We respect out indian government.  Your so called stars earn so much from the public and missuse fame . What did you do for the framers with all the money you have ?? Only if you did something open your mouth .
Sabka career mein kuch ho nahi raha, sabko pata hai politics behti ganga hai sab apna hath dho rahe hai bas ....chahe sonakshi ho ajay ya akshay ...
F*<b>*</b> rihanna thats all
I just don&#39;t understand why only farmers of N.W India having problem with Farm bill while rest if Indian farmers ok about it.
Hahaha...where is greta now???üòÇüòÇ<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edTegxOBIPM">https://youtu.be/edTegxOBIPM</a>
Meanwhile some stupid thinks Rihhana is muslim
We are united together ... Anti Nationals like Tapsee and Sonakshi who don&#39;t have any knowledge and credibility should be thrown out of the country . They r paid to say all this
Not even a single intellectual genius dares to highlight the negative aspects of the farm laws, because there are none. It&#39;s just a propaganda that has been well orchestrated and planted into the minds of the farmers. After 26th January I believe people should understand what&#39;s brewing.
All doubts about the farm laws have been answered multiple times point by point. Farm leaders have no point left. Even in the 11 meetings, they could not give any solid point. <br>All major economists and experts are supporting the farm laws.
It is not about one show rattling our faith. <br>It is about these shows coming year after year as part of a strategic effort to disrespect our Culture.

Delhi police constable exam Scam by SSC
You mock b wood celebrities of no proof. There was direct mention in that bloody toolkit that rihanna would tweet this. And everyone is acting like they didn&#39;t know the deal Between SFJ and Rihanna.shame on you
No need to give response to these actress.
Few tweets made the MEA respond!! Idk how our Government became so unsecure , they even sent templates to so called famous celebrities (all paid and fake nationals)üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Idk why can&#39;t twitter Ban Kangana&#39;s account, we won&#39;t have to look at her shitty tweets then.
Now I seriously think the govt should not replied to this in the first place.. Why did they even care that Rihanna or greta tweeted  something about which they don&#39;t even know anything. The opinions of these celebrities that have hardly graduated school or college should not be taken seriously... Govt should just quote the statements of IMF, WTO  World Bank, Asian Development Bank and the father of our green revolution.. The pro -protest media has also focused on the statements of these celebrities only while they have completely ignored the people who are qualified to speak on this.
Wait wait who is Tapsee??
Hindustan times why u lost your credibility for promoting paunati  tapasi panu, sonpari like flop star...
People are trolling Sonakshi and Tapsee but no one talking about Sonu Sood<br>Kyunki in right wingers k liye itna aasan nhi h na sonu Sood ki image ko malign krnaüòÇ<br>Easy targets choose krte h ye bhediyeüò†üò†
Tapsee Sonakshi Sinha and Sonu Sood are great fearless people
Taapsee missionary
So happy to see Bollywood standing for the right thing first time
Let&#39;s just not criticize some big personalities like sachin n others for their tweet, how come they tweet same in some extent unless someone has given then to tweet this like(government). Government is manipulating even their right to speech and expression in some kind.
I just want to say one thing if you believe Rhianna was paid to tweet and believe Akshay and all were not plz die ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ we have enough stupid people don‚Äôt need y‚Äôall ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôèüèªüñï
Everyone those talk against government laws will branded as anti nationalist,  but  that happen only  bjp in power. When  Other party comes power, make laws, people can protest against law, they don&#39;t brand you anti nationals.
I support Tapaswi, Sood and Sinha.
Issue toh badalte rehte, inka instance toh fix hi hai üò°üò°
Accha lobby wale actors <br>Tapsee <br>Sonakshi <br>Siddhart <br>Ek or hai anil kapoor ki chori, pta na kya naam <br>Beta aane do movie ghar na baitha diya to kehna
If farmers don&#39;t want those laws then they shouldn&#39;t be pushed accept those laws
These people are unbelievable. Some foreign singer is intervening in our matters are people are supporting it. Maybe if tomorrow I go to their house and intervene in their own matters they will be okay with it
First thing to control is this mf media&#39;s in india..have to bring strict laws
Tapsee, ...forget the rest.....don&#39;t have a single movie to act.....!! Some kind of so called last try to have some limelight
I just wanna ask... Why are we STILL talking about this. ? Why the f* do we care what a pop star says ? To hell with bollywood and hollywood. When IMF Chief, Raghuram Ranjan etc said in support of farm laws... News channels barely cared and are fanning some foreign popstar&#39;s tweet for a week now. When will we grow out of lapping around popstars and follow real intellectuals and framing opinions for OURSELVES ?

Namaste:<br>Khalsa: The Five HINDU warriors (Panj) the five Hindu warriors the PANJ PYARES who accepted the GURU&#39;s  call and transformed into SINGH to fight against the Islamic oppression, on 13th April 1699 guru govind RAI from patna BIHAR a HINDU who became a SINGH transformed the KHALSA order into SAINT soldiers, he asked for 5 volunteers who could give their lives for the GURU, the 5 volunteers were HINDU&#39;s from different cast and backgrounds from different parts of India, they were: DHARAM DAS (a jat farmer) - hastinapur-Meerut), DAYA RAM (a Khatri soldier - Sialkot - Punjab),  MOKHAM CHAND ( a DHOBI / washerman - Gujarati) , HIMMAT RAI (a Jhir / water carrier - odishi-odisha), SAHIB CHAND (a nai / barber - Karnataka) after reciting the 5 BAANIS guru govind Ji named them as PANJ PAYARE&#39;s who re-shaped the guru nanak&#39;s foundation and in return were greeted with waheguruji Ka Khalsa waheguruji Ki FATEH, than the PANJ PAYARE&#39;s were renamed as BHAI Dharam Singh, BHAI DAYA Singh, BHAI MOKHAM Singh, BHAI HIMMAT Singh, BHAI Sahib Singh,  from this very day the 5 HINDU warriors had a one devoted son a HINDU and one devoted son a SIKH in same families, BANDA SINGH BAHADUR was also a HINDU warrior, his real name was LAKSHMAN DAS VAISHNAVA and he was a KASHMIRI PUNDIT, Sikhism is a DHARMA religion and should not forget the 5 HINDU WARRIORS who became singh&#39;s to protect HINDUS and SIKHS, also Sri CHAND guru Nanaks son said that Sikhs should not forget their ancestroul roots of HINDUISM, NOTE: Khalsa was created to protect and defend MOTHER INDIA (Bharat Mata) including all DHARMA religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism,   bole so nihal Sat Sri Akal, OM Namah SHIVAY, JAI hind.
&quot; Why aren&#39;t we taking about this&quot;...indian media, people all miss interpreted her tweet as &quot;why aren&#39;t you talking about me&quot;.üòÖ...so here we all taking about her ..mean while Rihanna be like......
Again once again. One more breed joined using farm bills for their political agenda. Already toolkit exposed vested interest forces. And this new breed joined to fight bjp with farm bills as a issue.ü§¶<br>If it goes like this when will farm bills get ammendments.
So if someone kills u ,the problem is in u and not in ur murderer, thx for opening my eyes Taapsee
Lagta ha Country mae Civil war hon wala ha , don&#39;t know where re this people when police have been bitten up like animal. Now just because  Internet shutdown they re worried now this re same people who vandalized the tower&#39;s in Punjub,  hypocrites
When a long going protest becomes a motive for separatists and some foreign organization to spread there agenda to defame the nation........I think weather you belong to left side, right side, or totally against the govt. when it comes to the nation We should all come together to support our country and counter the separatists agenda and there propaganda.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23indiaagainstpropaganda">#INDIAAGAINSTPROPAGANDA</a>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23indiatogether">#INDIATOGETHER</a>
