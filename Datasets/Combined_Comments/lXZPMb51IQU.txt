In olden days women were best at singing and dancing. Before modernity
That is the advantage sanskrit gets
If they are interested in music many people listen to just shastriya Sangeet (women). That is why Veera Raja Veera works.
That director is not true. Best music or Best film. (Women)
If you believed all music in movies will be carnatic (women)
It&#39;s possible for individuals to have different preferences and biases based on their background, experiences, and cognitive abilities. Non-visual individuals may have a heightened appreciation for music directors, while brainy individuals might prioritize the director&#39;s intellectual prowess. However, these are just stereotypes and don&#39;t necessarily hold true for everyone. Appreciation of film is subjective and can be influenced by a variety of factors.<br><br>ChatGPT 🌹

You have to pretend runners up is best (Anurag)
All the other prizes are runners up (Anurag)
Absolutely, you&#39;re correct. The &quot;Best Film&quot; award recognizes the overall synthesis of all the individual elements of filmmaking, acknowledging that even if a movie might not excel in every single category individually, the way these elements come together can create a cinematic experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. It underscores the importance of cohesion, synergy, and effective storytelling in creating a memorable and impactful film.
Whether &quot;The Dictator&quot; movie by Sacha Baron Cohen is considered &quot;junk food&quot; entertainment can vary depending on personal taste and perspective. Some might view it as a satirical comedy with elements of political commentary, while others might see it as lowbrow humor. Ultimately, it&#39;s subjective and can be enjoyed by different people for different reasons.
Maniratnam should make the best junk food films.
Venkat Prabhu&#39;s film &quot;Chennai 600028&quot; can be likened to cinematic &quot;junk food&quot; due to its focus on light-hearted entertainment, humor, and easy-to-watch storytelling. The film revolves around a group of cricket-loving friends and their misadventures, offering audiences a fun and enjoyable experience without delving deeply into complex themes or narratives. It&#39;s the type of movie that provides quick, guilty pleasure akin to indulging in junk food for a temporary escape from reality.<br><br>ChatGPT
&quot;Golmaal&quot; can be considered cinematic &quot;junk food&quot; in the sense that it offers light-hearted entertainment with slapstick humor, much like indulging in a snack for a quick, guilty pleasure. The film prioritizes comedy over deep themes or intricate storytelling, appealing to audiences seeking easy-to-digest entertainment. However, just like with actual junk food, enjoyment of &quot;Golmaal&quot; is subjective, and some viewers may find it delightful while others may dismiss it as superficial.<br><br>ChatGPT
They should give an Oscar best film to grand Masti and entertainment. That would set a new norm.
Junk food films<br><br>Describing &quot;Grand Masti&quot; and &quot;Entertainment&quot; as &quot;junk food in cinema&quot; can be a subjective interpretation. Both films are often classified as adult comedies with slapstick humor and rely on lowbrow jokes and situations for entertainment. Some viewers may enjoy them for their light-hearted and escapist appeal, akin to indulging in junk food for a quick, guilty pleasure. However, others might criticize them for their lack of substance and reliance on crude humor, likening them to cinematic junk food that provides temporary amusement but lacks nutritional value or depth. Ultimately, whether they can be labeled as &quot;junk food in cinema&quot; depends on individual perspectives and tastes in film.<br><br>ChatGPT ♥️♥️🌹
Even script
People want to believe in logistical issues like call sheets, foreign visas, pregnancies and so on.
What I said is true but people do not want to believe that.
It works just like tamil poets 😉😉😉😉😉
Joke or serious do not know : Many people believe there is no category and if you spend more money you make better film like Bahubali or Adhipurush
If there&#39;s only one award category, it should be for the &quot;Best Film&quot; as it encompasses the collective efforts of the entire filmmaking team, including the director, actors, writers, cinematographers, and more.<br><br>---<br><br><br>I am only picking best film. That&#39;s all that matters and not AK vs AK
In many movies director has to just hold camera. (Anil Kapoor)
Yes, some movies are primarily identified by their actors, while others are more strongly associated with their directors.
I did a theoretical search with ChatGPT and directors are more important for better films than actors. However people do not go to watch better films but just actors they prefer even irrationally like junk food. If audience viewership is a criteria then winners are actors. If just films independent of viewership than directors. This is the theory.<br><br>Basically it is a philosophy problem: If a tree falls in a forest and there is no one around does it make a sound.

I want to go back to January 14th 2021 that’s the first day I watched the film on Netflix with my mom and I loved it I was hyped about the film good ending twist
What a movie mahn.. 😳
Anil Sir🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥
I STILL WONDER FOR WHAT REASON ANIL KAPOOR IS WEARING AIR FORCE UNIFORM.....THEY ARE DISRESPECTING A SOLDIER&#39;S UNIFORM ..SHAME ON BOLLYWOOD
Oh god, who thinks this dude actually love to sonam. He doesn&#39;t match to a father
Kis bhosdi wale ko ye movie acchi lgi? Aur kyu, INDIAN AIR FORCE ki uniform ki esi insult bardasht nhi ki jayegi, chase kuch bhi ho Jaye.......uniform ko Galt trike s <br>Pehna h chutiyo n, m khud ek AIR FORCE BRAT HU, defense aspirant hu, isloye dil p lgta h
What a waste of time
The best part of this movie was when Anil Kapoor gets hit by a car and Anurag says “Shot Liya na”. Shows how mercy less and mad film maker his character is.
awesome movie bhai climax is best
Wat a movie,,, I&#39;m a big fan of AK bt now I am also a big fan of AK who plans the script(those who have watched will know it, and those who haven&#39;t go and watch it)
The film insulting the indian air force
My big question <br>Is it real is or not ?
PLEASE MAKE AK VS AK 2
I like the creativity
Awesome. Not going to miss it.

Demeaning the dressess of our defence forces is their thing right now!

Baap ka dada ka bhai ka sabse badala lenga tera kashup😂😂😂
Bollywood legend in a video production looks cheap and sad (hehheh Bollywood in a nutshell btw). Film actors were selected to be photographed on FILM!   Hire new actors that suit video cinematography.

The best role played by Sonam Kapoor; other than the last few seconds of her during the credits, she was brilliant throughout the movie. Hope she takes on roles like this 😶👏🏾

Good use of uniform
The movie is good because his surname is KAPOOR !!
I&#39;m literally confused.<br>It&#39;s looking like its a movie about real life incident happened to Anil Kapoor.
JHAKAAS MOVIE!! A Breath of Fresh Air from Bollywood, thanks to Netflix... Excellent and unique Concept, Superb performance from Anil Kapoor, proving that his career is faaaar from over! Even Kashyap&#39;s acting was surprisingly good...Must Watch! Hope enough people appreciate the efforts to create something new....
Dumb sonam kapoor
Is ak vs ak 2 happening??  Wana see anurag takin revenge lol
Fakeness at its peak<br>Anil kapoor is searching for sonam kapoor by showing her picture and asking from civilians.
A bit like &#39;table no 21&#39;
Ek number bavaa love it 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩

AK vs AK based on True Story 🤔🤔
Anil kapoor is a fucking blessing to India. Nothing but respect for all he&#39;s been doin for his craft, especially at his age.
Earlier I thought AK vs AK was Arbaz Khan vs Arjun Kapoor 😂😂
The trailer is full of spoilers. Please dont watch the trailer b4 the movie

The film is more like Table no. 21 , but the latter is much better than this.
Spoiler alert: They hit  the camera a hundred times in this movie
Dawood ka sath hein yeh anil kapoor.. dont support him.. nhi bharosa hota toh search krke dekh lo

Trust me Anurag is telling truth about Bollywood in this movie 😂😂😂
Anil Kapoor playing actor, as a actor proves &#39;director is more important for a film as compared to a actor&#39; in a fight of actor Vs director.
Why if dress
Just watched movie... must watch 🙌
I couldn&#39;t understand anything<br><br>Will anyone please tell me the meaning and content of this superb trailer<br>🙏🙏😜😜🙏🙏😜😜
Anil kapoor ne jawani ka knsa portion pee liya he 🤷
Super hit
Good movie... I personally don&#39;t like anurag kashyap... But I love his work...<br>This time again...<br>Anurag&#39;s acting wasn&#39;t that good ..<br>But it wasn&#39;t that bad too.<br><br>Baaki it was an out of the way movie ..
Finally bollywood is doing the right thing. Kidnapping Sonam Kapoor
last tk movie ni real story lag rhi thi its really confusing
I never thought this movie will be that amazing
Superb movie!
This thing is so fucking confusing.
Is it a trailer of a film or behind the scenes or reality show or talk show or what the heck ???
Super Flop😂
Anil kapoor shoes changes in this movie check it
Sonam was kidnapped with makeup on 😂
vai pehle ja kar movie dekho. bad me comment karo.....<br>1 of the best movie...... 👍👍👍
Shame those who support this trailer or these ppl <br>One side a person whose girl always those ppl who want divide india n other a guy who same words like sonam kapoor <br>Shame guys
Sabkuch thik hai lakin what is the need of wearing IAF Uniform in it ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXZPMb51IQU&amp;t=5">0:05</a> true...
The biggest flop in the world
best actor male goes to harsh kapoor 🤣🤣
Ghanta reality sonam ki ankho mei over acting dikhai de ri
Both go to hell
We need a film : <br>Directed by Anurag Kashyap<br>Written by Anurag Kashyap and Christopher Nolan <br>With Nawazuddin siddique<br>          Pankaj tripathi<br>          Anil kapoor<br>         Jackie shroff<br>A psychological mystery thriller. Netflix, please do this.
OP ❤️
F**k off if you disliked the trailer😾 cuz movie is so good 😍😍😍

Mobile phone se banaya kya yeh flim? 😜
Great movie!!! Cant understand its real life or a Movie  Nice Experiment

Time waste movie
Baap ka dada ka bhai ka sabka badla lega tera ye kashyap 😎
Who disliked this?<br>This is an epic movie
Bakchodi ultimate 😂😂😂😂
yupp its Jhakhasss..!❤️
This movie is movie behind the scene trailer..😂 too confusing
Pata  nhi  sala   kya  haag  diya😆😆😄😆😄😆😄😆😃😃😆😆
Different kind of film, worth one time watch, the best thing is how the actors are so comfortable playing real life characters and letting certain things be on the reel. Good story telling and extra marks for the commendable performance of actors.
Jitna tera nawazuddin bhi naa kar paaye aisa realistic acting kar daala maine...
Anurag Kashyap 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Nice 👌 direction 👌
Kuch bhi
Atleast, Anurag saved us from Sonam&#39;s Acting. Thanks Anurag 😘
Everything is OK good experimental in Indian cinema, but purposely missed d Valimai Updated....
Duniya ki bakwaaas treen movie
No Kapoor were harms in these movie😂😂😂
Worst movie
Rubbish ....Sonam ki shakal dekhtay he mood kharab hogaya
घटिया , नशेड़ी
STOP DISRESPECTING ARMED FORCES ONLY FOR ENTERTAINMENT ... NOT ACCEPTABLE 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Am i the only one disappointed by not finding Arvind Kejriwal in this?
Chalo kuch to acha dekha
The worst kind of movie
Hope he never finds sonam 🤣🤣
Very nice film<br>Totally different concept
Yesterday night I watched this movie and yr no words just outstanding 🤣✌️❤️
now this is a movie unlike....sadak coolie no.1 staring varun dhawan
Abe ye Kya bawasir banadiye
Nawazudinn is best realistic actor.<br>Anil kapoor; hold my bear
New
Sir, it&#39;s not good sir you are disrespecting our 🇮🇳INDIAN AIR FORCE uniform 👮you don&#39;t know the value of this uniform.
What a movie man! Way to go Netflix. We expect this type of content more!
One of the legend trailer ☺️😎😎
Anil kapoor is still Jawan...😭😭😭
I really confused , is this movie trailer or behind the scene ? 🤔🙄
Kutty ke tarah lad rahe ho
bhagwan jaana sonam kapoor ko acting karna kab ayagi bhai isko dekha kaar hasi aha rahi hai bhai
it&#39;s awesome
loved the movie  🧡🧡😍
So it&#39;s a mock kidnapping found footage film with self aware actors playing themselves. Gotcha. Cool concept but not really anything new.
My rating for this film <br>4.5/5❤️
to Anil Kapoor, Jakkas to Bakvaash; to Anuragh Basso, totally time-waste
The best dialogue of the movie was the Taxi Driver saying &quot;Aur kya bolte Anil bhai&quot;😂
Just watch. This is unique indeed.
Kya bakwas h
The acting has been amazing from both, but it&#39;s just too huge a gamble to have released in theatres, for a general audience this won&#39;t work, it would be a flop as the content is not new except the characters themselves for real, not expected from Anil Kapoor atleast!! Atlast Netflix has promoted this for the least to say promoting the negative side of Anil Kapoor. It&#39;s a comedy more than a thriller
❤️Da ka Ak🤣🤣
Imagine running out of ideas.
This film restored my faith in Hindi films. An outstanding concept and execution ❤️
just saw the movie. It was a waste of time. Justbullshit
Finally 1 good movie after so long .
What a movie, Anil Kapoor 🔥
Wow Sonam ek film milla
Sonam ki mardi . AK NE 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
अल्लाह करुणा से सभी की रक्षा करे
sonam kapoor na mile to badiya he .😁😁😁 anil kapoor ji app sabse 1 no. actor ho
waooooooooo
This is something i have never seen even in hollywood tbh !!!!<br>Hats off to you guys
May be  trying to make an Indian version of &quot;A Serbian film&quot;. Definitely  not 18+ though 😅
Movie was fantastic .....OMG
Public ko gaandu bna rahe hi🧐🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
motherfuckers who disliked the movie trailer this was the best movie i have ever seen
New way if making laymen FOOLS and fall for such idiotic Bollywood stunts. SHAME ON NETFLIX 😡🤬🤬🤬
Superb movie
Why tf this bollywood guys are getting into netflix ?
Who come her to abuse...<br>.....
What a movie
Kya bwasir bna diye be 😂😂😂😂😂
After watching the trailer, it seems like unique content and a different way concept. I&#39;m going to watch it.👍
it&#39;s like watching a dog and wondering which one it has is head or which one is tail even though you know the answer
Anil Kapoor:- meri beti lapata hai.<br>Poora desh khush ho gya<br>after some time<br>Anil Kapoor:-yeh film ki script hai<br>public:- yeh bik gayi hai bollywood, ab bollywood me kuch nahi rakha😂😂😂
Sonam kapoor had 2 minutes of screen time in this movie and that too without any dialogue but somehow she still managed to be the worst thing in this movie along with her annoying brother 🤣🤣
Bakwas movie time west
Bachalo use drugs se
Lousy bollywood fuckers. Bunch of wannabes bastards
I&#39;d always thought is it possible that will there be any movie where they&#39;ll use the real names of the actors and here it is!! I&#39;ve always been  a Anurag Kashyap movie fan but here we see a good actor in a brilliant director.... climax was crazy!!
i first open thus movie and thought its some kind of documentry and shut it

बोसडी के क्या बनाया दोनों मिल हे अपने नाम से पब्लिक की मूर्ख बना रहे हो देख कर मा बहन की गाली ही देने को मन कर था है सालो
IAF ki wardi ka apman hai yeh toh 😾😾
Harshwardhan was so damn Irritating yaar. All he says fuckin Fuckin Fuckin. Highly irritating.
Is he showing Sonam&#39;s pic to the public while looking for her? Seriously?
This can be the Human version of finding Nemo🙄
यह फिल्म मेरे जीवन में सबसे खराब फिल्म में से एक है ... पूरी तरह से समय बर्बाद किया...
Anurag Kashyap&#39;s jacket name ? Adidas which edittion?
The policemen lol what an acting sir😂
English movie ka copy
Hugg diya yaar
You must include the director of films like Gangs of Wasseypur 1 and 2
Ganjewalo ki movie ganjewalo jaisi hi hogi bhadve saale
Yeh kya bana rahe hai roy movie jaisi feeling aah rahi hai 😑😑
Thank god sonam not much in the movie 👍👍👍👍
In the movie all time anurag say to anil.kapoor  - anil sir and sir<br>But anil kapoor &#39;s son harsh say to anurag all the time - fucking anurag
Acting me reality 🤣 reality me acting Jo samjna hai samjo
I don&#39;t know about people disliking this video. just gonna say if people wanna see talent in Bollywood. This movie is fucking brilliant.
BOMB AF❤️🌟
Kya Zamana aa gaya hai. Pehle film ka trailer dekhte thay aur cinema hall mai jaate thay ghar walo se permission lekar. Aur aaj webseries ka trailer dekhkar webseries dekh rahe hai bina kisiki permission kay phir bhi koi maza nahi aa raha...Miss old days...
Mene ye movie dekhi <br>What a fresh content 👌 👌 <br>Sach m maza aa gaya
Its a shame that just because its an Anurag Kashyap involvement that the film needs so much swearing. Why? Just because you are on Netflix and world is watching, doesnt mean you have to use foul language to get noticed.
Bestest movie i have ever seen
Mind blowing ❤️❤️❤️ I love ak vs ak kuch alage hai 🔥🔥🔥
I hope end me Sonam kapoor Nai milti.. :p
Just watched, it&#39;s what bollywood need, audience needs to support these kind of films, awesome concept loved it, baap ka dada ka bhai ka sabka badla lega re tera Kashyap
It&#39;s a diamond don&#39;t spread hate dislikers, it&#39;s the difficult work of 7 years which is real and appreciable🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wow!!
This called a movie
I thought it was Akshay Kumar vs Anil Kapoor but .... you disappointed me🙁
Chuthiyone chuthiya bana raha hain 😂😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXZPMb51IQU&amp;t=46">0:46</a> ide gaaaas  hahahahahha
Is it kamal hasan movie remake i don&#39;t remember the name but i have watched that movie!!
🎭Masterpiece🎭!! 🏆... This one goes out only to AK and AK (but no other actor in the film) 🙏
Sonam Kapoor&#39;s best performance to date! Bravo, bravo, bravo!
Don&#39;t disrespect our GREAT INDIAN ARMED FORCES...
Super fitness of Anil Kapoor...amazing actor
This was very good...climax was let down
AK vs AK is just a treat to watch... it has all the material to hook u up... Superb performance, Direction, Real vs Reel plot, 5 stars for the Jhakaas performance n direction...!!!!
Worst movie
Table no 21 ki copy
Kya Bawaser hai yeh?
Trust me, the movie is beautiful ♥
kasam se mind fucking blowing movie ......suspense , thrill, acting ,story ........real masterpiece
Blockbuster movies of 2020
Ak/ anurag kashyap<br>Ak/ anil Kapoor
Vikramaditya Motwane is magic.
Wow dislikes 😂People are still alive 🙏
Snake 🐍 Kashyap
KAPTI KASHYAP
Wah 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪ajkal indian movies aur Netflix ki story dekh kar aisa lagta hai jaise mix shikarpuri achar hai 🤪🤪🤪jis main Bollywood aur Indian air force ki band baja de jate hai hahahaaaaaa 🎃🎃🎃🎃🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊📢📢🤪🤪🤪🤪
Finest work by a director n actor ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Office sitcom style movie
Best film of the year. .. 🔥
It Quite Different from regular Bollywood Stuff ........Great movie
really go and watch it this is such a nice movie .........
Why so many dislikes, it&#39;s a great original idea for a movie. Don&#39;t let it flop.
this movie flipped me
I was laughing to see some parts of this ak vs ak trailer. They was a part where anil kapoor is dancing and anil kapoor hit by a car.
Better than disgusting Coolie No. 1 🥰🥰🥰
Ye kya mazak h 🤣
Good web series
disgusting movie, anil kapoor had tried his best as his acting skill was outstanding. but anurag had ruined everything. i don;t reccomend to watch but if  you have so much time to waste then go ahead
NOBODY WILL EVER BELIEVE THAT ITS TRUE EVENT MOVIE., THE WHOLE PREPLANNED BULLSHIT....
How they shoot the movie?😵😂
I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE AND ITS JUST FABULOUS , NOW ALL I WANT IS THAT NETFLIX MAKE ITS 2ND PART ASAP!!😊😊😊😊
This is masterpiece🔥
I don’t understand anything it’s confusing is this trailer or making of the film 😐
Very nice
THIS MOVIE THIS is IT. This is Indian cinema. For anyone hating on Anil you all should stop it with your pseudo intellectual opinions. The guy is 64 , he is also literally the best part of the movie not a fan of Sonam but she couldn’t ruin this movie for me at all. The storyline and Anil’s acting was THAT GOOD. WATCH IT jeez support these movies. That’s the only way for commercial movies like coolie to stop existing.
Mastt hai Movie -- Bilkul different --- 1 time Must watch 👌👌👌👌🤩🤩<br>Anurag kashyap ki movie jabardastt Hoti..Kuch alag hi sochta hai ...👏👏👍👍
Awesome movie
Why that uniform
Never expected this kind of masterpiece from Bollywood.
Damn Anil Kapoor is ageless
Jhakaas/ AWESOME,UNIMAGINABLE SCRIPT
Awesome anil kapoor sir u are the brilliant real life actor
Oh my God it&#39;s amazing 😍😍😍

Kya bakwaas hai 😡
Flop
👍🍌👍🍌
This movie really gives you an edge of the seat experience with super tense Bgm .The chasing and violence looks real , though it&#39;s scripted , Obviously .Lots of awsome One-takes and great camera work .Also it makes you laugh sometimes . One of the finest movie in 2020 .👍<br>[Spoiler] <br><br><br><br>Baap ka ..Dada ka ..Bhai ka ..Sab ka badla lega tera Kashyap .😁😐🤯
Different concept. Great
The end really got me! This is outstanding, kudos!
That is a Trailer or Behind the scienes.<br>What happen in Bollywood.?<br>What they want to do?<br>Ans: Wait &amp; Search...
Chalo .. sonam kapoor kidnap hui toh picture accha hua🤣
gangs of wasseypur 3 kab ayegi
Bas inki baate nakli aur movie usse bhi zyada nakli. 🤮
‘Saala yala mhntat acting’ 😂😂
Shayad Bollywood bhi acchi movies bana sakta hai😅
Iss movie ka Naam behind the movie hona chahiye tha😂😂😂
Will watch for Anil, Sonam and Anurag
After  BnfTv review
A rare gem is headed in bollywood . Wish more like this come.
Thank god she got kidnapped
Outstanding Movie 👏👌 Worth to Wathc 👍👍
is that movie ?
Why??
Pura jhakash mafik
it is pretty interesting that Bollywood is now making found footage style films I mean seriously that&#39;s interesting
ye asli me anil kapoor ke sath hua tha,<br>sad
Just time wasting to see this tharki movie
Wow❤️
No need to find her 😂😂
Abe ye kya bakchodi hai be, Ye anurag to mujhe lagta hai Daut hai shala Dubai me plastic surgery kara ke india me aakar ,  maje. Se jee raha hai...
Bhai movie dekhi ha.  <br>Osm. <br>Gjb. <br>Kya twist ha.
Kya chutyayi film hai bhosda mtlm kuch bhi bna rhe ho sb sale tumlog gnaja mar liye ho sb ka re
Finally we got something new from Bollywood 🔥...
One of the best Indian movies this year.
This is too good
This is  really something new...it was outstanding 🔥👌
Well i love how confused I am after the trailer lol
If you notice the background music is do you love me
But we all know ... The real AK is Akshay Kumar
25k dislikes are from mindless people who can&#39;t appreciate a unique screenplay and story.
This is masterpiece🔥.Vikramaditya Motwani&#39;s potrayal , the way he cinematise it is way ahead of it&#39;s time for bollywood audience. <br>Ye log Coolie no. 1 ko gali denge ki ye cringy typical bollywood hai and on other hand aise experimental, true cinematic experience ko accept bhi nahi karenge.... Waah rey Indian audience
Good movie
This is clearly way better than any experimental film ideas , anil kapoor and anurag spices them beautifully anil kapoor 40 saalo se hero hai aur aakhri saas tak hero rahega...
Guys first watch then comment yaar
This will test our brains for sure
third class movie
Next level concept 🎉🔥
Avoid this anurag keshyap
Aise comments daalo  ki saalo ki ga*d fatjaye. Kabhi socho bhailog yeh log army ke upar hi kyo karte hai yeh kyoki yeh planned hai inka bas ek hi motive hai ki kaise BHI Apne army waalo ki bezati kare
Khel karta khalaas. Bhai tera jhakaas ❤❤❤❤❤❤ superb performance. Anil Kapoor is back and khakaas
Just watched.. It&#39;s diff climax was best part of the movie
The most logic less thing he has made! Anurag you can never match the level of Hollywood.
what a movie ! Both AK Nailed it love it
I will try ke anurag kashyap ki dobara koi movie na dekhu...<br>Worst story total bakwas.....
Stupid movie to glorify movie actors...
SAME DIRECTOR👌 WHO MADE A BRILLIANT RAJKUMAR RAO STARRER TRAPPED 🤟
Dear Stranger who are reading my comment may their parents live 100 years❤️
Kaya movie hay bancho hahaha .wow 😂❤️ .just wow
it&#39;s somewhat like the truman show
Sonam ko dhundne Anil Kapoor bhi nahi jayenge ,🐶
Rrr movie weiting
Better watch John Cena&#39;s 12 rounds
experiment k naam pe kuch bhi..anurag is no way near “a” of acting..as an actor needs proper classes..pls get some..focus on what u do best..anil kapoor is a fantastic actor...but overall this is a bad movie
Anurag Kashyap Vs Anil Kapoor Ak vs AK
Jhakaaas<br>Diffrent concept <br>A must watch movie ak vs ak<br>Till end it make me felt real
The reason I won&#39;t watch this movie because it is a movie.
Apni family ko time do <br>Don&#39;t vest your money on <br>Drug ywood
Faltu
Sonam atleast 2 % seko tere baap see acting
<b><i>Its real Experimental Movie And Rock Movie🔥🔥i Wtch this Movie Out cLass❤</i></b>
KUtta 🐕
Kutta
I don&#39;t understand the amount of dislikes on this trailer. The movie is so soo good. Definite watch for everyone.
What a filim yaar..!!
This trailer is so confusing don&#39;t know this trailer shows behind the scene or it&#39;s just a official movie trailer. I wonder how much the movie will confusing 😂
Watched this movie today. And i really liked it. It was a fresh concept and anurag was a treat to watch. Plz dont spread hate without even watching a movies.
Abhi movie dekh ke aaya hu....movie bole toh jhakkkaaaasssss🔥🔥
It was good movie... Actually but at the time sonam came in the movie.. It was blunder...
Super moves aaj Maine देखा <br>Such me both are great ak vs ak
Well done excellent  Anil kapoor 😀😃😀😀👍👍👍
Abe tweets ki war dekh k lagta h sach m aisa ho rha h ...😂😂😂😂😂
It&#39;s like &quot;lost in London&quot; and &quot; blind spot&quot; people who interested in this go and check these masterpieces too
Only thing I absolutely hated about the movie was forming a conclusion at the last...the movie should&#39;ve been kept grim...gloomy and dark....kya zarurat thi last me....&quot;mere sath meri puri family act ki&quot;...no I mean the concept was mind-blowing...agar last ka 20 minutes nahi dekhta na...to probably till date this would&#39;ve been the greatest movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my life....just the reason why I ain&#39;t much attracted to Bollywood films is this...why Conclusion?Dark rakh do...aur kya... audience theories to hai hi...but moreover mind-blowing job....
Vs akshay kumar bhi kr lete ek canada citizenship phek ke marta gend phat jaati😂😂
Vs akshay kumar bhi kr lete ek canada citizenship phek ke marta gend phat jaati😂😂
Salute to anurag kadhayap
Jhakassssss...
Not a good film
Just watched it. Superb movie! Anil Kapoor is amazing in this one!
Ak beta ke sath ak baap
Ha ha anil ke sath yeh chor dobara khada hona chahta h
Very often you get a chance to get rid of trash like sonam.... I hope anurag kashyap wins 🏆💪🤣🤣🤣
AK vs ak is available full movie on my channel check it out
This was movie trailer or movie&#39;s behind the scenes trailer
First thing Anurag kashyap did is kidnapping Sonam.
Anil kapoor air apko airforce ki uniform pehna zarrori hai pehni hai chalega Gaali kyu de rahe hoo pehen ke
Isne toh mood ka hi Jingle bell baja diya....
bro its a total disrespect of an airforce uniform .man how are  we guys are enjoying this it -takes a lot of fukin guts to earn it man,and that to uniform of armed forces!!
C u soon dkhlo ja k
Wow... What a great script ... Great actor....   Anil Kapoor 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Anil Kapoor acting is like Aamir khan in this movie
I just watch the movie it was great movie in 2020 who agree me and who don&#39;t comment
The movie was very fantastic
I just saw this film. Brilliant act of anurag sir. Best film.
I hate Bollywood
This movie was epic and a masterpiece,must watch this flim
Sonam Kapoor lapata hai, toh dhundhna kyu hai?  ;-)
Mne esa trailer kbi nhi dekha mere ko smj me aagya
Meanwhile Sonam  was at hers friends house thinking it was a prank be like:- *lode lag gaye plays in BG *
Sucharita tyagi is here wooohooo
cringe
spoiler alert : AK VS AK part 2 me anil kapoor ka beta kidnap hoyenga
Audience: We want something new. Something out of the box(camera)<br>Anurag kashyap: Yes
Ye trailer hai ya behind the scenes
The movie was pretty good. Especially when Anil kapoor gets frustrated and angry during the second half of the film.. It seems real then. Anurag ji toh hmesha hi sadist lgte hi h. Haha. Love both of them. Worth a watch 4/5
This was an experimental film ,why the f**k audience wont understand. people are just busy in coolie no.1 even through they call it worst they watch it .it has more IMDb rating than this one ,please watch this , dont waste your time
Netflix waalo ko aur kuch nahi mila😂😂😂
To wo Twitter wali ladayi ka kya hua??<br><br>shukr h nakli fight thi, main to abhi tak apna side bhi decide ni kr paya tha ki kisko support karu😆😆😆<br><br>Tough Choice
Anil Kapoor&#39;s Last Try, Sonam &amp; Harsh ko sath me rakh kar bhi dikha diya ki aise krte hain acting, ab to seekh lo😛😛
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXZPMb51IQU&amp;t=97">1:37</a> Ye Acting Nahi Ha..............
Ak vs Ak is there will be sequel
ye kuch alag hai
Disliking it just because of cheap tactics used by both of them to publicise it.
Yeh kya bkchodi h
Notanki sala
Abe buddhe bus kar ab torture
Are bhai akhir dikhana kya chahte ho🤦‍♂️
It&#39;s a good one time watch 👍👍👍
I watched this movie<br>Unbelievable end
i could see Boney Kapoor here! Saaar valimai update saar?
Lawde ka Script
Sonam gupta bewafa thi aur Sonam Kapoor lapta h 🤭🤭
Plot reminds me of Table no. 21
Phely Sonam Gupta Bewafa hui<br>Ab Uski Bari Behn Sonam Kapoor Lapataa.
Fact that people getting confused by watching this trailer is the reason why people will watch it😆
Why Air Force uniform is involved in it ? 😶
Bolo maze ki baat yah he ki Sonam Kapoor tweeter pe aake 21 ko this is incredible, congratulations likh rahi he yarr anurag kashyap bhi unse Phone nahi chhudva paye aur kabh jabh woh kidnapped ho chuki thi🤣🤣
the iaf uniform is shown in a  disrespectful manner. I did not like this pathetic movie.
The indian air force uniform was shown in a disrespectful manner. I did not like this pathetic flop  movie.
The indian air force uniform was shown in a disrespectful manner. I did not like this pathetic flop  movie.
Just Watched The Movie!<br>Still Imma Say AK Is Phenomenal!<br>Now Keep Guessing 😂
Koo btayega kya bakchodi hai ye ?
म*<b>***</b> एयरफोर्स की वर्दी पहनने का क्या जरूरत है सम्मान ना कर सको तो आप मन मत करो यार <br>ऐसे ही नहीं मिल जाती एयर फोर्स की वर्दी 😠
&quot;hyla mhantat acting&quot;.......that was awsome :D
Sonam kapoor while watching the trailer- who kidnapped me baby when we are in paris?
Bakwas movie
Watched it now . Flawless .
Ek aur BAKWAAS..... 💩💩💩💩💩💩
Airforce ki uniform mazak ni h jo ise pahan kr badnam krra h🤬
This is called  soft influencing<br>Representing uniform like jokers  ISI ke pillo sahi paise le rhe ho pkxtan walo se
Just watched the movie. The best part of the movie is sonam had no dialogue &amp; people have to tolerate her for just few seconds. Not in whole movie.
Jhakas bidu
It&#39;s called content
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿
Ak Vs Ak very good movie saw it today morning.. entertaining Ak and aks performance brilliant and specially in the climax....something different but engaging 🔥
Extraordinary thinking ❤️
Kia bawaseer banadiye ho?
This is what happens when you&#39;re trying to copy Borat.
Insult of IAF uniform  in this movies
Why is he wearing the uniform of Indian airforce&#39;s pilot??
Table no 21
Netflix is becoming whorst Ott platform
Indeed only Anil Kapoor can save Sonam Kapoor in the industry ;)
Wat a concept man
Anurag ki movie chalna Band hogyi h toh nautaki chalu kardiya h
<b>Ek No Movie Bole to jhakaasssss Maaza Aa Gaya Yaar</b>
Seriously!??? Matlab kuchh bhi !!!!!
Saal khatam hote hote sonam kapoor bhi kidnap ho gayi😂  iss saal kuch toh acha hona tha
Sonam Gupta Bewafa hai <br>Sonam Kapoor Laapta Hai. Yhi mil rha ab Netflix ko . I am surprised that Anurag, being such a great director, is wasting his time with Anil.
Trust me this is going to be way better than Coolie No. 1
Anil kapoor:s acting in this movie outstanding
Single camera shots<br>5 5 minutes long single shot
Kamaal movie hy boss
Bollywood aur kitna bullshit banoge....wahi kapoor wahi khan...its so rotten
I am watching the movie I am so confuse🤷‍♀️ still 30 minutes left look so real
super BAKWAAAAS.
What a movie 🍿🍿🎥🎥🎥❤️❤️
BRILLIANT MOVIE ! :D loved it to bits.
The number of times Harsh says &quot;Fucking&quot; in his dialogue pretty much sums up his fucked up career🤣. 2 mins of fuckin limelight to fucking no where😜
These bastards again messed up with the iaf. Now nobody literally nobody but I’ll make sure as an iaf officers daughter and a spouse, he pays for this. People sacrifice, get trained , proves themselves and then they earn the prestigious uniform .
Anurag: script aisa hai... Maine Sonam ko kidnap kar liya hai... Aapko usko 10 ghante mein dhundna hai...<br>Anil: 2 ghante uska mooh (gutter) khol de... Tu khud usko chhod jayega 😂😂😂
Flopped
Ye trailer hai pr dekh kr lag raha hai &quot;behind the scene&quot; ya &quot;making of the film&quot; video hai😂😂😂
Its Called extra ordinary thinking by the director or writer, Total reality feelings. Awesome.
Ye kya hai
For those few who still think this is real - &quot;ghanta real hai ye&quot;.
This is really something new.
Bekar h
Marketing was top-notch but their service=SHIT, the movie not yet released. I completed all my work and was eager to watch this tonight...and highly disappointed.
The movie is not released yet why so?
Kuch bhi hootiyapa ko produce kroge @NetflixIndia
Director of wassepur in the house 😎
No Sonam Kapoor was not harmed in making but sentiments of Armed personnels were. But why think. They are meant to die. Good job India. 👍
Got Surprise by hearing that  this film was make in seven years.
Why do they say 24th December release ...when it is not releasing on 24th ...fuckers.,.
I am happy that sonam kapoor is kidnapped bcuz no one wants her bcuz she one of the dumb nd talent less starkid
This was a also a marketing gimmick.... Saying it will release today but did not released... It created more eagerness in the minds of the people as to why it was not released... Eventually leading to more marketing of the film...
Ma*<b>*****c*****</b> movie Kahan hai
Isme bhi indian airforce ko glt triqe se represent krra h adhiktr movie me humri army ko glt represent krte h😡😡😡

Why does it look like copy of 24 series in which Anil Kapoor was lead?
I&#39;m all in ...said ak
I think&quot; d &quot; told&quot; ak&quot;  To disrespect IAF uniform.<br>Samaj rahe ho ?
Please don&#39;t disrespect the Indian armed forces by using their uniforms according to you controversies I best way to attract the public attention because nowadays you are not getting views
Aha... Nice new concept
Ye Kya bawasir bna diye ho be..
Anurag kashyap ko next film finance karne ke liye i think ye film karni pad rhi hai. Bahut hi chutiayap hai ye

Who the hell are u to wear IAF uniform and use these types or vulgar language 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Why are you defaming IAF by wearing that Blue Dress, that uniform. Do you even know which rank you are representing. Stupid people

Is suchitra tyagi from film companion in this movie because she listed on the cast in the Wikipedia page
I think AK must be playing IAF Officer in a movie &amp; when on location his daughter gets kidnapped. That&#39;s why he is in IAF dress.
Saala yala mhantaat acting.<br>Ye acting nahi hai.<br>Nahi sir acting lag hi nahi rahi. 👌👍

Filling relax after dumb Kapoor kidnap
I guess India is the only country that can run saas bahu serial even in netflix..why even waste time watching these bogus shows..can&#39;t env make a decent series like the Hollywood does
Instead of AK vs AK, this movie feels more like &quot;Kapoor &amp; Family&quot;
I wil be really happy agar sonam Kapoor is movie ke infinite part tak kidnapped he rahe..🤪🤪🤪
the budget of the film is same as Sonam Kapoor struggle
Producer money been saved. Big thanks to sonam kapoor.
Omg, y’all are so mean. Like I understand if you guys don’t like her, but please don’t hate on others. Just ignore
Anurag sir.. Good..<br>Anil sir good. But tech her how to act like you sir...
report kro IAF ki uniform ko disrespect kr rha hai
Karma follows everywhere.. What he did Jamal few years back for being honest and he sent jamal to jail. slumdog millionaire. Now he himself come to police station for being not acting. simple
remake of mollywood velithirai movie
Chutya movie
Yaa IAF ka uniform ko mjak samajh ka rkha ha kya yaa bollywood walo na 😡😡😡😡😡 mothrchod bollywood.
LOCKDOWN( covid -19) has increased value of web series<br>Hit LIKE 👍 if u agree

Very experimental . Can&#39;t wait for it.
<i>bawasir</i>

Plot Twist:- AK was acting
Divine
Aap hasenge toh bhi...Pause was mind blowing and then koi outsider involve nahin hoga
Anurag kashyap &#39;&#39;sonam ko kidnap kar liya gya hai&quot;<br>Me in my mind &quot;thank god she is not in the movie&quot;<br>😂😂😂😁😁😀😀😀😆😆
This is the first time ever that Sonam Kapoor&#39;s struggles are real.
Military ka samman nahi kar skate toh majak kya bana raha ho  Anil Kapoor air force ki dress pahenakar altu phlatu movies banana  kya hai ?   😤😤
Wat stupidity is this.. meaningless contents from these established professionals..
Everything was jhakass until they said &quot;sonam&quot;   🙂  ) :
Anurag kashyap has ruined his career joining mainstream bollywood artist.  He no longer interests me🤮
BS
Ban ban ban ban
Maha bawaseer. Jab flop hogi to bolega indian audience abhi ready nahi hai. Ajab chootiyappa
So basically, Anil Kapoor is Indian Liam Neeson! <br>Wow, Bollywood “Taken”
😇
Let&#39;s see if this movie says based on true events...
Bai trailer   g**d faad hai  agar movie khatarnak huii toh  pakka aagg laga degi ye
Kya h ye 😳
Abe kon deta he inko vrdi phne ki izzazt
What a overacting 😂
This is not less than a big &quot; बावासीर&quot; . flop hoga  to bolega abhi indian audience iske liye ready nahi hai.<br>अजब चूतियापा है
This just looks faadu !
Piece of Junk.
Kuch bhe chutyapa
😂 Ye kya tha bhai..
R u people so stupid to understand that u r actually demeaning the uniform of one of the toughest airforce in the world.....does any of ur team members or Anil Kapoor even has the standard of cracking an Airforce exam.I seriously doubt....paise ke liye apne ma behen ko bhi bech to tum NETFLIX!!!
Ahhh Man!! This film industry has taken the armed forces for granted.<br>Here it&#39;s clearly visible that Anil Kapoor is wearing an untucked shirt with all those batches on, which is absolutely a disrespect for our bravehearts serving in The Indian Air Force.<br>And after watching the trailer I didn&#39;t get the point behind he wearing the uniform for saving  his daughter<br>I seriously am a big fan Anurag Kashyap but this thing is not right.<br>Netflix should definitely take some serious against this.
Nahi dekhunga, Sonam Kapoor ko marne do.
Anil kappor u r a great actor we want to see u in good movies like u uses to do like virasat, Black and white, Pukar..ye sab na kro aap yrr
Netflix is only hope  amid the environment created by ridiculous hindi tv serials.
😂😂
This is new concept by netflix
बॉलीवुड की मां की भोसड़ा अनिल कपूर की मां की चूत
Aye sonam kapoor ko mtt dhundoo yrrr ....usko band hi rehne do warna faltu ki shopping or bol bachchan karegi....
