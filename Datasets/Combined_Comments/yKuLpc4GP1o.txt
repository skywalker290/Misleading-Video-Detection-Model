😮😮😮😮😢
Thats why you should not hang around lakes or whatever that place is when you cant swim, like not knowing how to EVEN ADJUST YOUR BODY SO YOUR HEAD IS UP. They were like they were paralysed or something. Now imagine you guys if they were near water fall or at place where there is like turbine rotating (i dont know how you call power stations that use water as source of electricity). They would be dead wth no chance of being helped.
What happened to the baby next😮
U
And what did the cameraman do? <br>Correct he recorded it instead of helping
well played, sir.
Just miracle 🙏🏻 God bless that guy and those kids❤
Does the camera person knows how to swim? Or shout for help?
Hero
True hero legit .he earned his way to heaven 100%
I learned how to swim by drowning 1st and surviving that moment.
Wow. The little girl tried to rescue her friend. One word fearless. The guard didn&#39;t know how to swim. Two words, selfless and brave. So great.
Those children probably have parents that never taught them how to swim
👍
my issue with parents my issue with parents where is the f*<b>***</b> parents don&#39;t let your kids out of your sight
This freaking music is annoying
I would not just stand there like an Idiot for so long time...🤦🏻
Parents fault in this case due to not monitoring those children. Teach young children to swim at young age, for their own safety
👌👌👌👌
Go to swimming lessons with your children as early as possible
hopefully they got lots of spankins.
This is SO sweet. The fact that they remained calm .....Those children were SO brave. Where was Mom and or Dad?...That guard was also amazing. So sweet,
thank you God.. where the fuck is their parents!? Fucking!!?
How tf do kids not know how to swim yet.
Gotta love Asians they will put Beethoven on for the soundtrack of any movie or video apparently. Lol <br>Seriously I love Beethoven too though
😭😭😭 jay jagannath 🙏🙏🙏
Bless the guy

Hey! The man who drowned was finding his saviour who is a security guard, I bet he is one of these children! He found the guy and bond with him. I saw that in another video. The man said he was so thankful for the guard saving their lives!! OMG
How about this can we ask the question why none of these idiots knew how to swim in the first place come on that’s the first thing you should teach your kid swim dumbass swim
Fhfhhfffufuf
What happened to the person who shot this video? Shouldn&#39;t he stop shooting and called for help, or he go save them?
thees sad
Thank you so much
Where is the f*cking parents?!
Yep, completely staged for the camera.
They learn to float on they&#39;re back quick.☺️<br>I&#39;ve lived on the beaches all my life.<br>I don&#39;t even remember all the times I&#39;ve had to pull people to safety.
ตกแล้วจมมันโง่ อีโง่
คนฉลาดแล้วรอดมันต้องแบบนี้
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKuLpc4GP1o&amp;t=27">0:27</a> why he floating like that XD
sad but kudos to them to think at that time to just float and stay calm.. great job kids but be careful next time..
What a hero
Ok
I wish, I could be calm like the red kid during exam
ဟဏဏဟ
สุดยอดครับพี่
Good job baby!
Why are they playing Mozart?
What a tramemdous effort of those two kids... that&#39;s how need to be floating on the water without get panic.
those kids are smarter than most adults.. adults would take down even their heros in a panic
Cameraman enjoy the scene
Chinese propaganda.  Come on people, put more thought into what you&#39;re being fed &amp; stop believing all this crap.
Kdecuido
Sooo sweet babies 😥😥😥😥😭
NAM MÔ A DI ĐÀ PHẬT
Omg so fake.
Penyelamatan yang sempurna 👍👍👍
This looks staged
As far as i know if the two person are in trouble they dint floot in the water its already singking its my opinion ok thats the Real story wethere you like it or not lets experriment on actual seatuation you find out thats my opinion ok its only on my knowlegde
My sons fishing went inside waters then youngest was going to be pulleg by water inside two one my otherson jumped in and another saved his life . Thanks god .
I see an angel in this video
O my God
Bravo👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<br>These children knew what to do and it saved their lives. <br>Question; Did the red jacket child jump in or did he jump when he was falling in? Cuz he jumped
ดีมากๆฟ
All I see is people jumping into the water chaotically and then swimming further and laying in their backs . Why the fuck did they jump in and swim if they can’t swim? Tf
That dude literly ran all the way around 🤦‍♂️🤣
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wow
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
They have true superpowers to float themselves.
The one who said red one is smarter and white is not is the STUPID here. That girl in red is half concious. That is why her body relax. That is what happen when you almost drown. When your brain and body exhausted. They both just lucky. So stop make your own prediction. If she can be relax like that at the end, she dont need to act like maniac at the first place
Fuck the got who is taking video
อธิบายที
And what was the camera man doing? Waiting for the children to drown... disgusting
Эти дети умеют плавать. Их дома на воде. К чему этот цирк и для кого?
Those kids have knowledge how to float goodthing they use it.
Бедные дети, но умные!!! А взрослые сволочи подбегали и смотрели! Ни кто не прыгнул, кроме одного человека!!!!!!!!!!
WHY TF DID THAT PERSON TAKE TIME TO TAKE CLOTHES OFF ANF STUFF I WOULDVE JUMPED OFF THE RAILING SO QUICK
I am absolutely grateful for these kids having learnt to float in such a situation. ALL children should know how to at least be able float in a similar situation this will save your child&#39;s life.
Where are the parents? Immature people for sure.
No😔😔
The water doesn&#39;t seem deep and the shore seems very close.. 🤔 Sorry but I don&#39;t understand why it was  hard  to swim out of the water 🤔
太棒了大哥救了2條生命
God&#39;s mercy is new everyday.
This is so sad I woulda jumped over the barrier and saved them both at the same time tho.  Glad they’re ok
most people in china don&#39;t know how to swim
Why are they floating like a piece of wood? Is it real? It looks fake and scripted from beginning where the kid in red jumps is unnatural animated way.
Where in heck are the parents when you need them ??
And the mouse pointer guided them
Is that red wone ded😢
Los ángeles en acción, cómo siempre están a nuestro lado.<br>Gracias

Absolutely unbearable to watch. Thank goodness, they were saved.👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 I hope all children learn to swim ，it is so important.
Camera man filming instead of help them

Что делают дети там одни без родителей?Что за безответственность?А если они утонули бы?Детям  просто повезло.
Looks like the first kid jumped in...why dont asians learn to swim?
Who wasn’t watching their kids.. 😡🤬🤬😡🤬
Absolutely disgraceful parenting; not ensuring their children have swimming lessons.
Thật là mai mắn cho hai cháo bé cảm bạn đã ưu hai cháo bé chúc bạn luôn luôn thành công nhé
😢😢
Children are soo stupid.
The security guard is the hero here....where are the parents?

Porque se corta el video para mi q es video editado
Teach your children how to swim, it could easily save their life. Imo the fact that none of these people even the adult knew how to swim if a failure of their families. Swimming is easily taught at the right age and can be done almost anywhere with a few feet of water. I was lucky enough to have proper lessons at a young age but my grandma told me she learned to swim a very different way. She was scared to try so her older brothers took her to the local river and told her to swim or drown before pushing her in. She said she learned pretty damn quick at that point and if she couldn&#39;t her brothers would&#39;ve obviously saved her but that how it went back in the day. No coddling or babying, swim or drown, simple and effective.
Wow that white tshirt kids also jumped for save his friend and 2nd that security man
Teach your kids to swim as early as possible.<br>Even babies are comfortable in water with the right training.
They obviously know how to swing just based on the white shirt kid... just my opinion
I saw the kid staying still I though it died.
THIS is why, you TEACH YOUR KIDS TO SWIM!!!
Alhamdulillah...
Y yo solo me preguntó 🤔 quien rayos graba ? Se está dando cuenta desde el principio y no hacen nada !! 🤷
This is a set up..there was no current..the water was shallow near the rocks..and they could easily have climbed straight out .Also very unlikely that two kids &quot;DROWNING&quot; would act so calmly....TOTAL B U L L S H I T
Eu fico tentando entender a pessoa que tá filmando ja que essa filmagem PARECE TER SIDO FILMADA POR UNA CÂMERA DE CELULAR 😐
:)
Повезло🤔, я два раз тронул в своей жизни. Первый раз в 5лет упала в озеро, второй раз в 7лет голову подводой затянуло в трубу плотины для сброса воды.
😎😎😎
Cena montada pra gravar vídeo. Fazem isso, inclusive com animaizinhos indefesos.🤮
❤
The kindest video I&#39;ve ever seen on CGTN.
THE WAY THE KID JUMP IN AND SAVE HIM 😭😭😭😭
OMG... Cool kids..♥️♥️
O imbecil que tava filmando deveria ir preso!!!
My God What An Ordeal. Their Lucky That Man Saw Them And Reacted. He Is A Hero For The Rest Of His Life
Aonde estavam os responsáveis por essas crianças???
Thats why parent must be carefully their children
...
Gente   saber   nadar   e uma    necessidade    oji  em  dia   deveria   emcinar   nas   escolas 🏫
Criança não tem juízo mesmo 😱🙀👀 ir nadar sem acompanhamento de um adulto
Thanks God and this good people!
Eles estavam só boiando 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
มารับชมด้วยค่ะ
Espetacular
The guy who jumped in and saved them both also couldn’t swim! That was such a brave thing to do! Water scares many people through childhood fears, fear of drowning and just basically not liking water, truly selfless &amp; amazing 💯🙌🏼❤️
😯😱👍👉🔔
Poor babies I&#39;m just glad someone taught them well 🙏

Watching from the Philippines, proper training or swimming lesson in school is a must. But sad to say not all school have a facility..... And expensive to have a swimming lesson....
Hey liar the damn camera move like that damn liar video I😫

Masya allah
I respect this guy saving kids drowning.. but.. when hes see what happen, too poor.. its took long time to make a move...  N we can see this guy not have an experience about saving drowning... As we know to saving people when we reach the victim, head up of a surface... U dont need took a long time.. when see that... Expect the pool lot of aligator....
Ok ,tutto il rispeto per quello che ha salvvato i răggazzi, ma dov&#39;è sono i loro genitori??!🙈I bambini non si lasa cosi da soli  viccino a un fiume, acqua,.....che genitori sono questi??!🙊🧐triste per vedere una cosa cosi !!😮
Hats off tat guy

សុំអរគុណបងប្រុសដែលជួយ
OMG , So sad.That guy took forever.  I would&#39;ve <a href="http://jumped.in/">jumped.in</a> from the start . When my stepson was 6 or 7 me and his mom was swimming in the river in our little TX. Town waters real clear , people swim out there all the time .. we started finding stuff on the bottom people lost. Like sunglasses alot of those. I found a silver ring with 15 diamonds in it with TX star . Money , any ways Alex was on the bank well in shallow water as we both went under at the same time , mistake ! Will we was under water scanning the bottom , we could hold our breath along time . Well we both popped up at the same time . We automatically always look to see if hes fine.  All I seen was the top of his head in a different spot deeper out , he went out the wrong direction and it droped of real quik . I was in chest deep water he was at least 75 to 100 yards away .. he was doggy paddling , he was real chubby back then so i knew it wasnt good . I was running seamed like slow motion in chest deep water but it started getting shallow fast so i just kept screaming , Alex look at me ... Dont Give Up ... keep your Eyes on Me .. keep doing it , your doing good... trying to help with the panic . I will never forget the look in his eyes . He was scared to death  eyes real big . Man I&#39;m proud of him he never gave up . And hes fine , we never done that again.. but one time it rained alot so the river was flooded Rapids moving fast same all of us drove down to look at the water . We have a small bridge we drive over the river to park . Had my dog with me cattle dog , good dog protective . Well I was buzzing ALITTLE that day drinking , I thawt I would hop in the inner tube and ride it down ALITTLE ways then hop off . I jumped in , I did not think about my dog . He jumped in to get me , so now I&#39;m trying to grab him , moving fast I flipped out tube took off ,  dogs clum8ng up on me my heads going under then I pull him his goes under we I&#39;d that all the way to the bridge fighting the current.  Man we rounded that corner i seen there was only abou 6 in. To touching the bottom of the bridge we are gonna have to go under water for the length of a 2 lane road. Thank God there wasnt any hung up tree limbs under it . So out the otherside ot spits us out dog went left I went right , my shorts got ripped Off shirt halfway off one boot  and out of breath. I laid on the bank a min heard my dog winning , looked and hes about to jump back in to come across.  I heard the truck coming,  we made it . That water is no joke . Remember what I didnt if you ever get in that situation.  Try to relax dont fight it . Its gonna take you under and beat you up but fighting it will just ware you out . The next day I felt like I was beat up by 10 men and ran over by a car . Learned to respect that water real quik.
Ở đó quay video mà k kêu người cứu đúng là bọn YouTube
Good 😊
Omg ...that man is a real Savior💪🙏. May I know where is this please?

Of course China haters would say the security guard that saved the children was either Taiwanese or Japanese
Stupid idiot . He dove alone into the water
Whose making video ??
When I see the thumbnail:I laugh<br>Me when i see the end of the video:I&#39;m sad
Emocionante
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PllnajYf0F0">https://youtu.be/PllnajYf0F0</a>
The fact that they did not panic or struggle but lay on their backs saved their lives.
He don&#39;t know swimming too
How incompetent to hire a security guard who can&#39;t swim for a lake area....just....insane luck how no one drowned here lmao. I&#39;m really upset to see this though, every emergency needs to be considered when hiring security!
FREE TIBET
Who the hell  was that guy one whose taking video instead of saving those lil ones
I didnt know you can float on fresh water
Are they okay?
Auh hero medal
Good thing they knew how to float. <br><br>Where are their stupid parents? How can their parents let them play near the pond without keeping an eye on them?

The camera man thought it was to good to put down his camera to help
Just lay on your back. At the beginning you would think that you are drowning but only your  body will get submerged and your head would remain on top of water. Remember to keep your legs and arms straight.
They left the childern unsupervised near the pond!
No no no💔😔😭😫
Jitne video kya hai vahi to uska baccha sakta hai na to fir Hasina kyon nahin kiya hai ki sab jhoot hai
Let’s make pond angel! That was a joke but this person did a great job saving them!
But what about the guy with the camera
All is well that ended well.
When the girl in the white tried swimming towards him🥺
I fell into a pool as a small child and I remember feeling so relaxed and at  peace when I saw my Mom, fully clothed pulling me out. I wondered what all the fuss was about. I swear it felt like I was breathing underwater.
China must make it necessary, if not mandatory, that school children take swimming lessons.

Adultos irresponsables dejar esos niñitos solos frente a una laguna ..tuvieron suerte de sobrevivir por la ayuda del adulto ...que descuido ..
Puto héroe
Modo tieso
Damn, they are harder to get rid of than I thought!
For anyone who cannot swim. You won&#39;t sink if you relax. Easier said than done. Tense up and you will sink like a stone. Lie on your back.
such a good friend that he jumped in to helped his fellow kid friend 😃
he was going for a walk to enjoy the fresh air then “Eh someone is in the pond!” 😂😂 good guy 😃😃
Hahaha so funny
I think they should make swim lessons in school mandatory or a class on survival can save ALOT of lives
Pansy standing there staring... I would&#39;ve lept over the damn fence to get them. He even ran around and <b>STILL</b> just stood there watching! 😠😠😠

Y la persona que está filmando estaba dispuesta haber cómo se ahogaban que dejar de filmar?
The guy really took his time saving them. Like, damn did you get your shoes off alone with your shirt to. Did you stop to put on swimming trunks too.
Awww sad and happy at the same time, second fell to get the first out. 😊🥰
Thanks all to save thier lives
DEUS É FIEL PRA GUARDAR O SEUS PEQUENINOS👏

Allah ka shukar
Where is the mother and fother I think they don&#39;t want there baby&#39;s

😄😄😄😄😄😄👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Where were the parents?
Thank God they&#39;re smart enough to stay calm instead of panic, which could&#39;ve caused them drowning.
🙏DIOS BENDITO LOS PROTEGIO MANTENIENDOLOS A FLOTE
We all must know swimming .
good job...
I have USCG training and I would have been in there in a heart beat no question.
Whoever you are, God bless you!
I see miracles and dramatic in this video. Kid were floating instead of drowning and the man who rescued them didn’t know how to swim but he done job perfectly. Can someone explain with logic here?
Salute that man. God bless him
Who the hell would be recording in such a moment and not going to save them  !!!!!!!!!!!!! WOT THE HECK !!!!!!!!!
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Que triste los dos niños se ahogaron 😭😭😭😭😭😭
CPS ain&#39;t gunna waste time on this one...
This is why you make kids learn to swim. They saved their own lives knowing to float and relax.
Stupid parent🤬
Oooo...Thanks god.....for saving their lives
У мужика реакции-ноль. Уже спрыгнул бы с моста за ними. Как дурак стоял, потом оббежал, разделся и еле плыл. Капец. Хоть самого спасай

I will teach this to my daughter.<br>Even if she dont know how to swim, atleast she know how to calm and to float
👍👍👍
Parents need a public beat down
But how can I at 36, male, kinda obese and aquaphobic be able to float like that?! I think I&#39;m doomed. Hence I&#39;ve stopped visiting swimming pools and beaches.
I wonder what is the camera man doing this whole situation lol, he was just like let me record this whole thing and post it in youtube 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀
I was saved twice and saved my little brother and a teenager from drowning..both equally scary..my little brother panicked pushing my head under water..thank God I was able to put him on my neck somehow and walk us while still underwater to the shallow end where we could stand..god bless them!
respect to help !
南無阿彌陀佛
😂😭😂🙏🙏🙏
God bless these beautiful souls! 💖
Прыгаи черт
Да жестко
Why didn&#39;t he jump over the rail every minute is crucial
Always teach your kids to float on their backs at a young age.
So, can someone tell me how to float on my back?
Looks stupid or it&#39;s fake! How did the kid suddenly turned out to be in the center? They were both near the stones on the bank! There&#39;s no stream at all! Why the adult is standing and looking? Doesn&#39;t look truthful at all!
Thank God they know how to float🙏
The kids are soook smart 🥺 They floated on there back until someone showed up
Bravo save by the way &amp; bravo young  children for not drowning,  for relaxing &amp; did the float, wow ! Move ! Yeah !
На одном дыхания смотрела. Слава богу, что дети живы.
Clap for camera man 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤬
40 years ago, I was the same age as these children when I was saved from drowning in a lake.  A woman jumped in, pulled me off the bottom, and carried me to shore.  30 more seconds and I would have been dead.  I will never forget her, just as I&#39;m sure these kids will never forget this man.
Teaching your children to swim is important too.
and the parents of the kids a<br>taking a selfie 🤳🏻 in the other side of the bridge 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
People should put the camera down and go and help.
Why did they get in the water if they couldn’t swim
The main culprit is the parents of these two children
No man was a jerk the kids could have died as casually took his time and why he wasn&#39;t watching these kids anyways if they they were black that be in jail no questions ask 🙏🤔🤨
The more you flat on surface of water, the greater is the chance to survive.<br><br>Broken english
amin
always remember , parents or guardian, eyes on the children even they are kids......
too dangerous
i think this is a fake video because if it is real, why the person filming it did not help at all but kept on recording
Teach ur kids to swim or keep them away from water
a di đà phật
Survival instincts 🤙🏾
Что это было?
😳
Screw Super man this guy is a hero
Whoever taught them to float on their backs saved their lives
And wtf was the camera man doing? Watching them struggling😡fak you
Hello Chinese Govt:<br>1. Don&#39;t plaster the screen with links before the video is finished. Very rude to viewers.  WAIT!<br>2. While this was a heroic act by a person, why don&#39;t you show some of your govt&#39;s cowardly acts toward your own people. Fix your issues and don&#39;t do propaganda for your sick govt.  Fix your govt.
O my god so said love from Pakistan
Camera man should have saved them, instead of recording this video.
At least teach your son or daughter how to float. They did great
thôi song rồi nguy hiếm quá
This man important her clothes 😭😭
Glad they are OK, but if that was a hand held camera why didn&#39;t the person holding it do something!
Omg, angels procted them...
I taught my kids to not panic and lay on back and float. Both love too swim but not good at it. My son actually did this in frount of me at the beach. And remember ed too float.
GOD IS GOOD ALL THE TIME AMEN 🙏🏿❤️💯<br>IT TOOK HIM FOREVER TO HELP THEM
Thanks 👏
😓😓😓
And who is that idiot taking video without saving 🤔
Its kinda weird... Why the white one dont pull red at first and why red just continuing goes away... Why dont red take white hand at first?<br><br>Thats only what i saw at first...<br>But i love the way they float themselves
Chinchilla hats<br><br>2 weeks ago<br>The other kid going to save the one who fell in 🥺 they were so smart to stay calm and float on their back. Most kids don’t do that.
Remember 2 mind game pros kicked out China Hillary Clinton met them at airport that is them tricked Hillary Clinton
Like that time Hillary shooting the face off another senator paid a senator to cry say it was a hunting accident
I seen senators save a child that was staged im Christ u can&#39;t lie to me thy lord cane Buddha g
To save one life is to save all of humanity
I like the one who tried to save.. but then.. she struggled more than the kid she tried to save.  Luckily the other one was smart and know how to float calmly while waiting to be saved
2人とも助かったんですよね？？<br>浮いて助けを待つ、って親に教えられてた？ここの近所でそういう教えは当たり前に教わってたのかな？<br>怖かったろうに慌てずジタバタせず浮いていて本当に偉い。<br>親御さんなのか学校の先生かわからないけどそう教えておいたのがこうも結果を出すかと思うと、些細な事でも、普段の生活とかけ離れてるような事でも教えておいて損は無いですね。
<b>I am proud to say that I&#39;m the mom of these two kids.</b>
Спасатель бля тормоз )долго думал бегал...
So the person recording just decided to not run down and help??
Am I mistaken - didn&#39;t the child in the red t-shirt purposefully jump in?
Every kid in the world should learn how to swim from 4 years old, it should be mandatory in every school in the world. 👍🏻. Just a small effort for Governments around the world.
Good brave Samaritan, smart calm children.<br>God bless them all ❤😇
Who is the person which is making the video😡😡,as camera is shaking not calm(so someone is making video and not helping these for long time😡)
Waheguru
This is my worst nightmare... thanks youtube for showing me this. So thankful someone was there to save them.
China？
Worst nightmare of our parents
Bruh! How they know how to inflate themselves and float on their backs? Lmfaooo
Smart child
Người cha thứ hai của các con.các con có phúc khi gặp người cứu sống các con,A Di Đà Phật,
Omfg I nearly bawled my eyes out! I thought they had drowned! Wow! Such smart young children😢 floating for as long as they could until someone came to rescue them. Thank god and god bless that mans soul for being there that day✨✨
👳🙏🙏🙏🙏
What i saw is that the kids knows what they are doing..<br>You can do such floating if you had a training..
That water looks kinds natural like, as if it&#39;s an ecosystem or something...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>wait... oh no...</b>
Saved by a hero who is not a swimmer. God bless you for ever... MA
God reminded them how to survive drowning
Deus poderoso
Honestly, teach your children how to swim........ Its kinda basic in my oppinion.<br>Gj to the dude
For views its May be create like this I think
Both know swimming
all i can say not to offend anyone, where the hell are their parents, really irritating when being careless like this, children are hyperactive always, being parent your work is to supervise them time to time. luckily the kids survived.
Ok. Were was person who was filming all this
IT : Time to float children ! Hehehahaha !
Was this video shot from a spacecraft?? What the hell was cameraman thinking??
Where was the struggle
So smart children
மனிதம்
I woulda just jumped from the top
Is the red kid died?
why don&#39;t people learn to swim in china?<br>Even the guy who saved them could barely swim which makes what he did actually quite brave.
Great work sir   may Allha bless you.....
shamefull that you kept filming for 2 fucking minutes .  you could have chosen to instantly drop the camera and help them . but nooooo   making a video seemed more important   didn&#39;t it .    the camera man/woman should be jailed for their unwillingness to  jump into action .
i wonder how the kids are doing today.
这俩孩子厉害了
Gott sei Dank 👍
Wish it could&#39;ve ended this way for my 9 yr old cousin  S I P Cameron 😔

Smart children with dumb parents!!!
I think it&#39;s funny how that guy ran all of the way around.  If it was me, I would have been up and over the railing.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Долго думают, помощь или че, родители не оставляйте детей без присмотра!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just came from a video where this exact same thing happened...except in the other video the girl&#39;s sister just sat on the side of the road watching her older sister struggle and drown.  Luckily some delivery driver on a moped saw the girl in the water and jumped in to pull her out.
You are so great sir 🙏 ..
Alleluia!
i thought the boy in red was dead
Why no one wtching kid play
At first I thought the red shirt child is dead but he was a Brainiac
Храни господь и компартия того человека который рассказал детям, как вести себя в опасности на воде - лечь на спину.
Maybe instead of building a skyscraper every day, China can build a few swimming pools.
Scripted
Oh my god.
Why don&#39;t you just quickly look for help rather than filming them to death
Oo
Why the music, ...
It&#39;s a prank 😂
Brave kids
Man I’m an adult I would hate to see this, I can’t swim and would most likely jump in and drown.
Hero
Зачем мне это в рекомендациях выходит <br>Я спать не могу от ужаса такого <br>Ради всего святого не пускайте детей одних к водоёмам
I don&#39;t understand why they moved so far away from the rock bank that they were holding on to at the beginning? Stupid kids🤦‍♂️
Praise the lord
But why did they not just stay close to the rocks and grab onto something like they did at the start
fresh water is more difficult to float
Oh my God
Fake
13k thumb down？ what is wrong with those people? in real life, all pretend to be gentleman while oline, totally release yourself LOL
Pesan khusus untuk orang tua keluarga &quot;jangan pernah meninggalkan si kecil tanpa pengawasan di manapun dia berada anda harus cepat sigap tanggap dan peka😇🙏
Seems the one in red jumped in
The one who dived in to a real friemd
هل اجد من يترجم هذا الفيديو
Security guard didn&#39;t know swimming
How the F they cant SWIM!!!
to the person who did nothing but stand there and record this—   -_-
So where are the parents?
Chinese people need to up their swimming game
আল্লাহ আপনি আমাদের ছেলে মেয়ে কে হেফাজতে রাইকেন,,, আমিন

Luke warm response but it&#39;s good though
But wat the shit the camera 📷 man doing.
sana all naliligtas
I will defenitely jump after i saw that
Ahh damn their smart.<br>Instead of struggling their just float.<br>Now I understand why mom started at floating techniques instead of swimming formation
i only see a cursor swiming and nothing else
precious babies!!! omg , that was so hard to watch , yet so amazing that they knew what to do !!! but why that music EEK.. bless the childrens hearts
🙏🙏🙏💓❤️🌷🌹
2人とも泳げなかったって事かな？<br>でも冷静に浮いて救助を待つ事を知っていて良かったし、無事救助されて良かった✨
Stop arguing on which is smarter, Can we just appreciate the man who tried to save em&#39; even if he couldn&#39;t swim
I have to disagree with the description saying the security not being able to swim, if u cant swim trust me you will not jump in, n i actually think he is so fkin slow tho he saved them
The child in the white would have drowned if someone did not come when they did
Wondering the person filming the video is doing.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Yeah wheres the freakin parents.
Glad he showed us with the mouse cursor where the kid was.
Ya Allah in baccho ki Jaan bacha de😭😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Back float is smart technique i had to try too
Calm in the water works well done kids
Thank goodness there were no Gators in that water.
im adult and i cannot even do that 😭😭😭😭
О Алла
The camera man with tripod, just watching...
Whoever thought these children to float on their backs saved them with knowledge
Thank god this children are safe 🙏
WTF?!?!?!  Those kids are swimming?
Allahuakbar
And where is they stupid parent who left them alone..??
حتى اطفالهم متعلمين على سباحه منو لاحض شلون حافظو على هدوء لو باقين يرفعون اديهم فوق كان غرقو

Thanks to that stranger
It says struggling, but they just look like they are chilling for two minutes, lol.
Background music: Beethoven symphony No.7 II

Ой как я переживала за этих детей,что же сними сейчас,живы они остались😭
1st one was just chilling
؟؟
چه اتفاقی افتاده؟؟؟
idk how to swim but i know how to float my body
13K dislikes, thanks oh dear🙏🙏🙏 great people
What a ideia to put music on that kinda videos.
Who is recording?🙄I&#39;m in doubt
But, why not learning swimming? Let&#39;s teach our children how to swim without delay.
I so said 😭
Что за музыка? Не могу вспомнить , но точно помню , что в каком- то фильме слышал.
ليه يجنزلون مقاطع زي كيذاة😭🥺
bullshit...<br>fake .. video edited in between ..<br>1. if u r able to float then u must have learned water threading .. if u have learn water threading then u must have learned basicstrokes - breast stroke..<br><br>2. u fell at the edge ... how did the they end up in the mid of the pond ( stagnate water) not a flowing stream or sea...<br><br>3. the water isn&#39;t deep enough ( adult was walking in between)<br><br>4. video shows clearly that the kids knows swimming and they didn&#39;t fell in to the water .. instead having fun.
The security guard is a HERO!
Fuck off cameraman, bastard 🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😠
Lũchó ngu
The fact that they know how to float is genius.. I can&#39;t even do it.. Parents pls watch your children
Thanks to the men!!!  But I would rather jump first before remove my attire..  Good job..
And who says angels don’t exist , well done people god bless 🙏💖👍🏼.
I am not even kidding my dumb ass will probably just drown , the kids are really smart for real
God bless Your Browser
Without knowing to swim, how they were able to float 🤔<br>I have been to this situation couple of times in my childhood. I used to get drowned rapidly 😭
I like how the one kid jumped in to help the othwr
I dnt understand...is it vry imp to do vdo that time...???the camera man..dnt hav that much of humanity to save the child????😈😈
Good person
😮😮😮😮
Way to jump and help safe two lives!
Que fait le blanc il l&#39;a sauvé puis il l&#39;a lâche est et parti
Thanks that man 😍😍 damnit tats scary  poor kids 😰<br>If it&#39;s me  il be drown that day
Salute to the hero who rescued
🤒🤒🤒🤒🤲😨
first to teach our kids ,stay float .remember .
One of God&#39;s angels....truly
Floating on back can work??
Soooooo sharp brain.
All people were doing great on their own parts, which was lucky.
Thank god man .....chinese black white latin dont matter the race...our children do not deserve death they deserve the best in life thwy r our future
How lucky they are there&#39;s no crocodiles, they&#39;ll be easily ripped in pieces if there&#39;s one.
Good thing they know how to float. Even me as an adult i will panic if i witness this alone because i dont know how to swim as well. Good job for the security guard.
Still i don&#39;t how they  float . Thanks god saved
😭😥😢
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKuLpc4GP1o&amp;t=90">1:30</a> так неохотна в воду лезит
God bless u sir
Whose the camera man he can&#39;t save child if something happened to them he or she will be responsible why u all are not noticing that instead of making video camera man should save the child
Is this CCTV footage? or someone who shoot the incident?
اللهم لك الحمد على نجاتهن
Looks staged
😱👍😀
The other kid going to save the one who fell in 🥺 they were so smart to stay calm and float on their back. Most kids don’t do that.
Why didn’t the person behind the camera go help the kids he just kept filming....?
Боже,я очень надеюсь,что дети выжили!!!
Read the description, thank me later ❤️
Algún comentario en español en abril de 2021?
China fake news channel.. water was not that deep child can walk
Pauvre enfants, que dieux soit avec eux.
Quá thông minh
И что это было??
😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I would if jumped over the rails for those kids
Some parents need there arses kicked letting youngsters play near a lake without them being there madness
And this is why you don&#39;t leave you kids unsupervised at a pond when they don&#39;t know how to swim
Plot twist : <b>the kids had fun floating in the water and this uncle just ruined it</b>
thank y god🙏🙏
Ya Allah pak rahama 😢😢😢😭😭😭show everyone&#39;s right way inshaAllah ameen sumameen from Pakistan
Type of friends you need in Life.
yea for the red shirt to be able to remain so calm so they could float no problem is amazing..very proud
😠my🤬🤬🤬തന്തേ, തള്ളേ ഇല്ലേ 😤😤പന്ന
What the cameramen is doing? Recording video ! Shame on you
এর লাগি বাচ্চাকে কাছে রাখা একা কোথা না যায় আর কে বিডিও করছেন হে গিয়া বাঁচাতে পারলা না
Good job 💯
<b>let me see some cloud</b>
This is how I float thinking what has my life come to. 🏊‍♀️
ഹോറിബിൾ
No!
The shore was like 5 feet away how stupid are these kids
Everyone saying their smart for knowing how to float is silly. Yes they could float so they lived but a better thing to teach them is not to fall in in the first place! Especially the second child!!!! They should have run for help, not got close enough to also fall.<br><br>Im a swimming teacher! We teach the kids to get something that floats and throw<br> it to the drowning person and to lie down at the edge to reach into the water and grab the person, so they cannot fall in. The second child clearly had no idea what to do. <br><br>They are just lucky they stayed calm enough to float and wait for someone else to save them.
Chuttiya Camera man sala
salute this human 🖤
Teach your kids to swim!!
I shed a tear
Better course of action would be running to adult
They were just chilling and swimming
😭
Who leaves children near water?
Trust in god🙏
Idiot a men
Super
Thank u every one
Thank God
Ah so this is why they taught us how to do the “sea star” in swim lessons when I was little

Well who the heck is videoing this the whole time but not helping???
Esse é um verdadeiro anjo da guarda
Who is taking video,idiot

No excuse to not learn how to swim! Everyone should know how and teach their kids
Question why did he jump in
Who are those 13K people clicking dislike on this video? Do they prefer to see the two children die in water? How is youtube full of horrible people like this?
Love you nice
I have tried to learn how to swim for so many years but not success.  If I happened to be there, I don’t know what to do except yelling for help.

Thank you god thank you men
can i just say that I watched Bondi Rescue and I swear from the most part of people drowning in australian&#39;s most famous beach are either japanese, chinese or korean people it&#39;s unfortunate
Who was recording ? Why didn&#39;t him or her safe the kids or rush to get help ???
Вот это герой.Господи дай ему всего лучшего.
The kid with the white shirt was trying to help the one with the red shirt but they both failed

Tq god smart
Nhinh thang cha nay du du thay ma tuc
Looks like a staged video. Children knew how to float and breath.  Security cameras do not focus on the action they just record.
Who was filming?
Many people cant swim in china  even the plice sad
He’s a hero
The response from the man is very slow!!
Hi
He is a Hero
Почему не прыгнул сразу как увидел?! Побежал в обход, потом ещё штаны снял , время только терял🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️.надеюсь второй ребёнок жив остался...
😱
Itu laki apa bukan lol
Muddai lakh bura chahe to kya hota hai, wahi hota hai jo manjure khuda hota he
Oh God
public stunt fake video
Even that guy who help the kid not good at swimming,but he decide to jump in,he was “i must reach this kid no matter what”.
Nadie cuidaba a esas criaturas ...
Thank God you little girl through how to float
งง  อธิบายน่อย
omg😢
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Humanity
I don’t know swimming but I know how to flout. This video taught me I can still my life in water.. but what if no one comes to rescue me!! :/
Wow, that girl was really struggling! She was really fighting, he got there just in time!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKuLpc4GP1o&amp;t=30">0:30</a> secs is a long time to think.<br>If u should get in and or not, to save those kids
what did the person who was filming do?
Holy crap
Those kids are great actors
Astahfirillah
Thank goodness that guy was there god sent him. 🙌🙏
Lol I&#39;m 14 and all I know is that I&#39;d jump in that water the second I saw them even the cost of my phone would be gone for them kid&#39;s
This is a terrible video
el que a yudo los niños primero lo maldeci&#39; .porque estaba tan fresco semejante vuelta que se dio y se quito algunas prendas de verdad que me dio coraje yo me ubiera tirado desde arriba con todo puesto almenos los ayudo y no paso a mayores pero baya que me despere mucho
Main v dubane se bachaya gaya hu 😭yar very good yaro I love you ❤️ so much save life Jai Mahakaal Jai sree Ram 🚩 bhai log
The kid in white shirt is brave he didn&#39;t let the other one alone, he try to save him when he couldn&#39;t he kept following him.
OMG
What were two boys unable to swim doing playing by the water unsupervised??  Although the little boy in white was sure brave (not smart but brave) trying to save his friend!
They are smart
What music?
Allah razl olsun🤲🥺😭🌹
The worst thing is someone panicking in water ... it makes it very difficult to save that person as many times they panic and start to hold and push the saver into drowning... it has happened . You can’t blame the person who’s panicking but it is important not to panic.
😥
Ye jo b vedio bna raha tha agar ye vedio stop karke pehle jaan bcha leta to iska kya jata

BRAVO
Ahhhhhhhhh
Why
O no I&#39;m scared
Where are the parents?
hoooo por dios como ay su cosas q pasan
It&#39;s interesting, cuz I thought the kids would just floating and kind of relaxing in the water. I didn&#39;t realize they were in distress.
لاحولة ولاقوة إلا بالله
Jai shree ram
At gateway park in Penn Valley, Ca I saw 3 drowning kids and one brother trying to help, thank God I was able to get 3 to shore and a man jumped in and got the other one, it was scary but nobody drowned

Let me get my swim trunks. Hold on!

Violations of Sworn Oaths to the Constitution alone should be grounds for expulsion from the US Government (all levels). The way it is now, any covert Traitor or Spy can gain Public Office and Wreck this Country. This should now a National Security Issue..
very smart kids floating on their back.
Omg so glad they are ok . Bless their heart
Tu vedio bnane me jitna time lgaya utna me bca skta tha

What
She will remember her friend always and no hesitation put all her money even her life in her trust. But who know, she is the one who stab her back in real life  in chinese soap opera in gangster movie.
what&#39;s with the music?
Amen
Accept they know how to swim on there back better than me
There is no God but Allah Muhammad, the messenger of God.

Молодец, мужик! Спас детей.<br>А взрослым нужно быть по внимательнее, смотреть за маленькими.( Если они были не сами).
Batti baji video he
Thank god and god bless dt person who saved them🙏
тормоза тупые
I thought he was going to jump🤣
Where were the parents or the guardians
The guard doesn&#39;t know how to hold someone and swim. 🙄
They are lucky couse no crodcodile
Omg where are the parents?? Negligent parents 😡😡😡
Kiddos..... don&#39;t play by the water without an adult and especially if you don&#39;t know how to swim!
👍🔥❤️❤️❤️🎉👍
omg
I thought those were plastic dolls on water based on the thumbnail.
Ini yg kejadian yg di Menggala/Lampung itu ya yg pertama adik nya tercebur kedalam kali terus kakak nya mau nolongin adek nya terus ada ibu nya juga terus ada nenek nya juga lalu jadi viral itu bukan ya
Tô com coração quase pra parar pensei que eles tinham se afogado 😢😢graças a Deus  QUE AJUDARAM
от таких спасателей тоже нужно спасать
sorry to say this,what I noticed was, how the girl was still floating even though they had been drowning for quite some time.maybe this vedio is just done to teach the audience this vedio .because very rarely the victim does not sink to the bottom of the water
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlQBW9VTiZo">https://youtu.be/PlQBW9VTiZo</a>
Oh my god super helping
You cant yell because you can suck in water and stop floating. Its so cool that people were watching over and smart to see how they could help. <br><br>Lakes are the worst especially if you have no training etc. If you get tired its better to float.
👁👄👁
They are hella smart , like doing this when u r drawning is hard
The camera man just watching Wtf
Why is the camera man videoing?!
Wtf arw then parents
Bukannya d gendong d angkat malah di ambangin gt haduhh
Thanks god...
OMG....I thought the kid in red t-shirt was dead.
There is no way they could of survived RIP to both
I hate masses of water!!!!!!!! It&#39;s not for human comfortability or entertainment period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HUMANS should be no where near it!!!!

But were they to late or?
Eles se afogaram?
Es muy lento dió esa vuelta por ke no se tiró por en cima
Some adults wouldn&#39;t survive this..<br>why? cause they are easy to panic <br>these kids are lucky and they used their brains,memory and mature thinking<br>but ofc most adults would too
Oh my God😢😢😢
Hold up where was the parents or guardians?
👍
И что это было?
Nao entendi nada nos comentarios. Mas nao tem ninguem morrendo afogado ai... que nao sabe nadar, afunda de imediato... so volta a tona uns tredias depois... e quado rompe o basso e infla o corpo...
Good  ..god tanks
Parents? Where are the parents?
Who was watching them? OMG
Thank God someone taught them how to get on their backs and float.
Дети легли на спину, молодцы. Видимо их родители научили этому. Я научил своих дететей ложится на спину в таких ситуациях. Жизнь - непредсказуемая штука.

Hero
who video taped this the whole time they was drowning??
I almost drown in my bath tub. I can&#39;t swim...
Very idiot
Thanks God they were no crocs in water
The one in red just lay on their back like nothing happen. I thought was a dead body lmao. The one in white struggling to stay afloat. Might want to lay on your back with little to no motion. Your body will naturally float if you do not move.
kudos to the kids for not panicking.  i wonder if they&#39;re kids of one of the faculties there, if so i can see why they&#39;re smart to figure out how not to drown.
And where are the parents , number one life skill to all  parents , teach your kids to swim !🤷🏼‍♀️
🙈👍👍👍👍🤒
Preciso fazer um cursinho de inglês urgente
Statt zu filmen sollte diese fiese Person lieber Hilfe rufen
👏👏👏❤️
I do not understand, it is like they were all caught in quicksand.... sorry but I did not understand
Am sooo terrified watching this
omg
Ебливая постанова. Препиздки плавают на спине и все
HEROES DOESNT ALWAYS WEAR A CAPE IN REAL. GOD BLESS THESE MAN.
Зачем я это смотрел, блин???
Stupid parents
E os idiotas dos pais, estavam aonde?
What a guy the now swimmer security guard is
I just saw how that white one went to save the red one but end up getting into pond itself
چقدر غم انگیز. مادر بچه ها کجاست ؟
The kid in the red 😂😂😂😂😂
😔😔
Parabéns  a este senhor que salvou vidas
А чо с рекой?Или она чем-то покрылась?
Aw poor babies...the way the other went to save her friend. Just so innocent.
the brave girl in white went to save the other girl
Oh God 🙏
Essas pestes sao teimosos, aposto que não  ouviram  os pais.
God bless those guys lord Jesus Christ.
They didn&#39;t look to me that they were struggling. The one that was first in was just floating on their back. They were not in trouble. I have done that myself when I was young.
This just brakes my heart thanks the heavens for the guy

Ujas😱😱😥😥
To be honest. Those kids must have also be trained. They did VERY well, especially the one in red by staying calm and staying a float. Because my ass arms and legs would have been flying and I would have drowned.
This is why I&#39;m taking swim lessons. Not for my own sake,but just in case someone else needs my help.
Oooo uf follow me 🥰🥰🥰👈👈👈<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mirzafaishonlehenga">#mirzafaishonlehenga</a>

There is clearly someone filming this👁👄👁😑
Simple fact roll over on your back and float everyone that can swim knows it.

All this while my heart was breaking....

Unnam security guard for US president 2024
Дай Бог ему здоровья и его детям!
What The Heck I Would Have Dived In From That Balcony Thing  Not  Just Looked At Them
Am so glad they know how to float on their back
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Red shirt:  &quot;It&#39;ll be fun he said&quot;
Red shirt :D     210 IQ
Q.
Where the fuck are their parents though? Honestly.
This made me cry

Gaaaaa :v
.vcxs
Ok, ok they are safe .... However the one in the red jumped in I would have wore his tail out.... Horse play no adult supervision... Parents???...  Accidentally fell in my ASS!!!
We should all teach our kids to flout👏👏👏👏👏👏
Fucking man
I think its fucking dash both are know swimming... they are acting like smart.. by practically human fell into the water they drowned... but they smartly swimming what fuck human have a knowledge
Bambini stupidi
The kid are very smart I&#39;m proud of them
Video kon gadda bana raha hai
Thanks hero
How did that man manage to swim. I can imagine him trying to copy the movements he sees other people do when swimming but still... sheer willpower and adrenaline!
WHO CANT PEOPLE SEE THE GIRL
security guard also didn’t know how to swim, which made his decision to jump into the water even more heroic.
That&#39;s why it&#39;s best to know how to float first
best thing to do is dont panic ..relax and turn on your back and lay stilll u will float til sumone comes saves you.......dont panic.....
wats
Poor babies oh my god I have kids this is scary to watch poor poor beautiful babies xxxx
Их спасли кто знает
so sad, the parents should be put into jail
Wie lang wollte er eigentlich noch zuschauen bevor er mal auf die Idee gekommen ist das man da vielleicht mal retten könnte ? Was ist nur aus den Menschen geworden. Da graust es einen richtig.
Ngayon kulang napatunayan na napakaraming bobo sa ibang bansa umikot pa para iligtas Ang dalawang Bata Kung tumalon Sana siya ede mas madali tsaka Yung bahay niyo bakit pinalagyan niyo ng tubig 🤣🤣

oia esse youtube man, recomendando isso
Like feel just for you hero thanks
Não entendi, eles estão se afogando ou brincando??
con nhà giàu ngu bỏ mẹ
Poor babies! Thank God they are fighters
Очень страшно...
Guuaaa los niños no miden el peligro solo juega y jurgan cuidado papas solo un segundo y se trassforma en una terible trajedia
If the security guard didn&#39;t know how to swim, how was he swimming!?
bien por el guardia que aun sin saber nadar se medio al agua pero deberían contratar o capacitar con natación a quienes trabajan en zonas de lagos , piscinas o similares
Quick question... Where are these babies parents!!!
They survived thank Goodness , that piece of Music is Fantastic, one of my favourites.
Thanks and God bless you
💔💔🥺😓
True hero!!
Glad they all are OK. I think everyone needs to learn how to swim &amp; drive also
Where are the &quot; so called PARENTS  &quot;.....Dumb asses
Идиотс
Bginilah tiada yang lihat yang budak bermain kat sungai.. Harap selamat
I wonder if this was in China?
When I was 10 years this happened to me then I did what that girl did just floating until my dad notice that and swam to save me. I was so scared and believe it&#39;s my last day in my life hhhhhh now I&#39;m 29 years. Alhamdulillah.
Mẹ cứu ng sắp chết đuối còn ở đó cởi đồ
How they are floating in water
God saved them believe me
جزاك الله خيرا
And where the fuck was their parents?!?!? They should be charged!
YA ALLAH
Omg horrifying.
Where the parents? Leave two kid’s alone, in a lake like this is irresponsible, fortunately by grace of god everything gone fine.
I went to the pool by then drown because I was wearing my swimming suit on
No gator arround ?
Where the hell were their idiot parents??
And the public learning lesson is..thank you Chinese government
The parents are stupid they can’t even keep an i on him
撮影してる人意味わからね<br>警察に通報しなさいよ
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
And where are the useless parents, kids and water don,t always go together
Nakita na nalunod nung nag video Hindi pa tinulungan
smart kid there in the red. funny that humans drown when the human body literally floats, and why do humans need to be taught how to swim when every other animal does it naturally.
Hy vọng 2 cháu kg bị sao.
11k dislikes, ARE U HEARTLESS?
This gaurd risked his life to save others. God bless this guy, true hereo.
Useless  guard
なんで、こんな事に。
Always best to just float and don’t exhaust yourself
i couldnt have asked for a better soundtrack while i die drowning
My goodness,if I can swim I don&#39;t get not even close to waters.what da heck were they doing there?? Thank God this quy saw them and help them out.
Really hats of to that guy you are the super man sir you don’t swimming but you save it’s really not simple you are the real hero 🙏
මිහිපිට දෙවියෝ..
Tf were they just trying to swim or .I&#39;m confused
漂浮這一招叫做&quot;死囡仔躺&quot;，小時候夏日裡常在每年會有婦女投埤自盡的虎頭埤玩水，年紀這麼小就會這招，太厲害了。
Eu daria uma surra muito grande nesses muleques !!! Ate eles desaiarem.

Awesome ending! <br>Thank you security guard! Well done!<br>The very first thing any parent can do is to teach their child how to float on their backs and -in still water they can get back to the side by barely moving their hands. When in doubt... throw things into the water that might float...<br>So many things do these days.
Why are there 11K thumbs down?? 😳
