Audience should have kept their mouth shut while they were singing. What a waste..

Would have been even better without the croud singing along out of tune
AWZM, you&#39;ve now got a fan in Arctic LoVe Islands, Norway! &lt;3
So weird being from Waterford like Ronan and Glen and seeing them casually on the street after this. 😂😂
Absolutely brillant!
Still can&#39;t believe I&#39;m watching my cousin hahaha incredible Ronan!
they&#39;re so happy! this is awesome ^_^
This gave me chills!!! 👏
Hello, Im writing to you from the One Show at the BBC and we are making a piece about Adele. We would love to use some of this footage, would that be possible at all?? Thanks again Charlotte
She needs to go easier on the food. She can&#39;t even successfully hide it under the loose fitting gown.
That gives me goosebumps that&#39;s amazing
Could anyone tell me the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RBcIPuKDUc&amp;t=210">3:30</a>
Can the bitches just stop screaming??!!!

Viva Adele, you are beautiful FOREVER.

the whole world  has the need to sing along with Adele...
I wish people would just enjoy the moment rather than cheering every other 5 seconds...
Bravo
LOVE
they did a good job, from what I could hear. too much screaming to really hear their music.
I like how she just sand in the back, and let them sing...so wonderful
Cannot wait to see her in Seattle in July! OMG she is so amazing!
woohoooh!!! :D
Adele sendo Adele...Amooo
OMG :&#39;(
AMAZING absolutely amazing. Well done Adele and the lads!

😌😌😌😘
she just made these boys famous
Stop singing audience!! I wanna hear them not u.. Grr
Amazing singers. Adele is always amazing.
I think I love the Adele Audience as much as Adele! You guys shot some awesome video and it was really well done capturing the emotions of the musicians on stage.
Yes, it also made me love Adele more too .... Amazing!! Love it!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RBcIPuKDUc&amp;t=160">2:40</a>, fucking goosebumps.
Better than Rebecca Black
i liked it, but could someone make those people shut the fuck up? Reality TV and their trained audience to clap when someone shows up, clap when he/she shares her age, scream after 2 seconds of his singing, scream after first complete scencence, screams after they recognise a song, scream after single thing they notice. You people didn´t appreciate shit. I love Adele, but thought she has different audience at her shows.
this was amazing!<br><br><br><br>but i cant avert my eyes on that guys pants........
very emotional. love Adele and  the guys were great. ye did a great job. mary
cool
This made me love human beings so much.
кто заходит на мой канал и постоянно ставит дизлайки?
Brilliant . Love to see work like that
this is why i love Adele so much :) these guys are amazing
Amazing.
This is awesome!!!!!!
glad I watched this.
Jesus shutr the fuck up women, you paid to hear her/them, not yourselves.
this is gonna be a million view in a week...
This made me love Adele even more. OMG this was amazing
Awesome clip! I&#39;m a producer at Entertainment Tonight/The Insider -- could we use some of this video online? We&#39;ll credit you on screen. Let me know either here on at brice.sander@cbs.com. Thanks!
