&quot;i think im close to beating it guys&quot; <b>is still in the titurial</b>
This reminds me when pewds played ARK
“Do you die if you die in this game?”
i miss pewdiepie.
as a subnautica enthusiast, it hurt when he said &quot;I&#39;m assuming this is procedurally generated&quot;
This is fucking 3 years ago???!!!
2020 was 3 years ago...?
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!<br>(PewDiePie)

Pewds: maybe i should go towards the ship?<br>So who&#39;s gonna tell him? 👀
Ahhhh, it’s always good to see people overstocking on mushrooms on their first run.
pewdiepie says this game is so beautiful 2 secs later ew ew ew this game is disgusting
There are something worse then sharks...
great video! Im trying to learn how to make videos and yours are one of my inspirations. I have some videos up of subnautica and Im improving a lot because of you I think.
since the very first playtrough hes ever done pewds has been talking to inanimate objects i wonder why
I came here after days of following the news about the missing Titan sub.
felix! why are you always sucking on my toes

Hes right
PewDiePie: A grown man playing like a child.
This has to be one of the greatest games I&#39;ve played.

PewDiePie next play subnautica below zero
Pewdiepie: Mushrooms!!!<br>Literally all the people who play: plz no
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=936">15:36</a> &quot;I think I&#39;m close to beating this game&quot; When he hasn&#39;t even made a base ;-;
I wonder if he will also get the fear of the ocean by the Aurora way witch is the hard way
As a reward, I shall give you my seed.
There are no sharks
BUTIFUL
Why do I have so many mushrooms - Felix, 2021
I played this game on my computer.<br>But I don&#39;t play it anymore.<br>Subnautica&#39;s still on my computer.
👍👍👍👍👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I have that game
Here before 40k
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=187">3:07</a> same reaction of me seeing that lmao
I feel like every youtuber always grabs an inventory of acid mushrooms on their first playthrough.
This will be a good series
Pewds: finds titanium in Limestone &quot;YEEEEE&quot;<br>Subnautica players: ...
Of course Sean recommend subnautica to him 😏
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=298">4:58</a> every guy watching recognized this hand gesture
“Do you die if you die in this game”
to get seaglide you need to scan all 3 fragments
they fart poison
Honestly you probably chose a good time to play it. it&#39;s had a lot of updates since 2014 and 2015. and improved greatly
I love that he asked if there’s sharks seconds before encountering the Sandshark
Yo can make Titanium Out of Metal salvage
experienced players watching this and wondering why he didn&#39;t make a scanner
No shocks do you see monsters will kill you
Bruh his aurora wasn&#39;t on fire?
please bellow zero next
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=277">4:37</a>. no its actually not procedurally generated, but you can spawn in different parts of the &quot;spawn&quot; biome

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=238">3:58</a> is that no way
The amount of acid mushrooms he picks up in the beginning makes me sweat 😅
New pet: cuddle fish
Pewdiepie: Are there sharks in this game?<br>Everyone who’s ever played this game: I wish
I just love the undertale reference
Not even 4 minutes and he found leviathan.
&quot;Do you die if you die in this game?&quot;
😏🤐
“I think I’m close to beating it I’ve been playing for a while”
I&#39;m a part of your nine year old army general pewdiepie
&quot;Maybe i should swim towards the ship&quot;<br><br><b>HAHAHAHAHA</b>
Why does every beginner Youtubers for this game always pick up way too many acid mushrooms lol
I don&#39;t play this kind of game very much, but after vivid explanation and demonstration, it seems to be very interesting.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=870">14:30</a> what is you your dead that&#39;s what you is 😂😂😂
The most unsatisfying part is him looking for titanium and going past sm metal salvage
Levithen
seeing pewds going through what i went through feels sooo relaxing
Best game i ever played
Someone should introduce pewds to No Man’s Sky. It is like this x110% as far as building and exploration
Pewds: &quot;Maybe i should swim and get closer to the ship&quot;<br><br>:Should we tell him?<br>:No no, let the Man conquer his own fear.
I wanna see him go 600m deep.
You the best bro 🤗🤗🤗🍺🍺🍺
&quot;Can you have like a flipper friend in this game&quot;
Ahh your to big to plock!<br>My mum next to me: o-O
<b>drinks bleach</b>
Glad you played it hahaha
Hopefully my Minecraft dog wasn&#39;t on there -pewdiepie
Pewds you should try the new Gargantuan leviathan mod when they release it😥
I think I&#39;m close to beating it because I&#39;ve been playing a wile.what you don&#39;t know
JESUS loves you very much and died for you 💔🙏❤️.
That is the most quick I ever seen someone find a reefback, xd
I slept on this game for a year<br><br>I&#39;m regretting life choices
O
dont say bad words or else i will unsub
I remember watching this during quarantine
idk why but subnautica always gives nostalgia vibes.
Felix: I assume this is procedurally generated<br>Subnautica: Cries
my anxiety everytime pewds doesnt scan something 📈📈📈
So sad he doesn’t make a play trough, i think he would have absolutely love the game.

This game don&#39;t have procedural generation...

“I think I’ve almost completed it” ha ha ha no we’re close buddy
Play subnautica below zero (its in early access so there is bugs)
I think I have nearly completed this game.<br><br>Veterans: you’ve got like 30-50 hours left to play
Was swimming around 2 days and didn&#39;t figure out what tf I&#39;m supposed to do in game

“I think I’m close to beating it” <b>literally hasn’t done anything</b>
&quot;I think I&#39;m close to beating it. I&#39;ve been playing for a while.&quot;<br>My guy hasn&#39;t even scanned a seaglide fragment yet is he for real
was the ship always that close?
Pewds&#39;s span in gaming is short and im glad he loved Minecraft
Just started the vid. Who else is waiting for him to encounter the leviathan with the name of Death minus Grim?
Him talking to the fire extinguisher was him losing his mind

I will never forgive you for killing that cow. It was so long ago yet my feelings do not budge.
It pains me that he didnt let himself enjoy the game as we all did.
I speak Deudchland 😆 ,,wie läuft&#39;s in Amerika?&quot;

bro the map of subnautica is so small compared to the planet, imagine you could explore the whole world
I have watched this 10 Times allready, please do more subnautica videos
How do I buy merch
Felix: i think im close to end i&#39;ve been playing for a while Subnautica players: keep dreaming Felix

You should try the mod return of the ancients.  It brings big canonical surprises to the game.
why does he not get the survival knife
The first thing people do in subnautica: gets high on acid
So the maps are different cause I spawned right next to what was basically the void
we cant see ur oxegyn
Pweds: I think I&#39;m almost done with the game<br><br>Me: Are you sure about that
Correction, it’s not a horror game it’s a terror game. The game makes you scared of what’s coming before it’s coming, nothing really kills you and that keeps the scariness alive and there at all time, terror not horror
Some random creature: makes satanic noises<br>Felix: “Shut up! Shut up! I’m Swedish and I don’t speak Deutschland!”
I started playing this game recently. my thalassophobia and submechanophobia is not having a good time
Pewd u are my fav now cuz you play this my fav game
i been playing this in vr so cool haha
FINISH THE SERIES! or else…

Pewds:&quot; i think im close to the end of the game since ive been playing for awhile&quot;<br><br>me who has played for 50 hours and still hasnt beaten the game: &quot;this is just the beginning&quot;
Hi
If you didn’t fill your inventory with acid mushrooms the first time you played the game, you’re not elite
&quot;What happens when you die?&quot;<br><br>A: They take everything good from you, which is why you still have 500 mushrooms.
&quot;Don&#39;t hurt Swedish man in water ... We explode&quot;😂
Bro
Pewds: are there sharks in this game,<br>2 seconds later encounters sand shark
Love ur vids
From the thumbnail I thought it was a cringe family friendly dad gamer
Fun fact: <br>When pewds in the start said &quot;I feel like if that crashed it would cause a fricki tsunami or some sheet&quot;<br>It probably did. <br>Ryley Robinson (the name of your character) woke up from a concussion after being hit in the head by a medal plate that fell off inside the life pod during the emergency exit from the Aurora.<br>This leads us to believe that a tsunami happened, but Ryley was asleep which could also explain why you arent as close to the Aurora as you would think as the tsunami would have pushed you away.<br><br>(Note: I&#39;m not trying to hate on pewds i love his videos just wanted to let other people onto this theory lol have a good day)
AS A PERSON INTERESTED IN ROCKETS I CAN TELL YOU THAT SPRAYING A FIRE EXINGUISHER ON A FIRE IN A SPACE CRAFT WITH LIMITED OXYGEN  SUPPLY IS THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO IT WILL KILL YOU FASTER
It is sharks yes, it is the Reeper
Came to this video fully aware of how goddamn cringey it&#39;s gonna be to watch. 😎👌
I had no idea Felix played Sub1, wtf!? 😱<br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m late absolute f**k, I know. 💀
this game is survival and horror game
&quot;I think I&#39;m close to beating the game!&quot;<br><b>5 parts later</b>
Finish your series please.
I dont know why he didn&#39;t complete it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=935">15:35</a> not even close pewds not even close
Pewdiepie needs to play Outer Wilds
Please play subnautica below zero!!!!!!!!!! I think it’s better than the original
come back to the game ffs
Fills up storage with acid mushrooms, continues to dive deep and pick up more 🤣🤣🤣
&quot;I think I&#39;m close to beating it&quot; <br><b>Still hasn&#39;t figured out the easiest way to get water, or really left the shallows</b>
Jack must&#39;ve had a real laugh watching this series
I wish pewds would finish this game :/
felix if you&#39;re reading this. FINISH THE SERIES
youuuuuuuuu curse
“This game is amazing!” 2 seconds later: “THIS GAME IS DISGUSTING.”
Me finding that pewds made a whole series on this:a surprise to be sure be a welcomed one
I wish subnautica would add a toggle run option... holding down my joystick is doing so much damage lol
if you have a thalassophobia don&#39;t watch.....
I love how everybody&#39;s first instinct when getting this game, is to get an entire inventory of acid mushrooms.
Jesus Felix, why do you have so many mushrooms
get a load of this guy, he thinks hes almost done with the game heh heh
um mr. pewdiepie you can find a friend its like a octupus  and its name is cuddlefish that you can play within
Experienced subnautica players referring to themselves as &quot;veterans&quot; is so cringey
even Pewdiepie cant avoid this urgent feeling of picking up tons of Mushrooms^^

Love watching him play games
‘Yea, that is titaniun’ picks up floater
Now you got below zero to play
Hope he plays the new one (even though the first one is slightly better)
Me: <b>Goes to creepvine forest on hard-core on first playthrough</b> Stalker: imma end this man&#39;s whole career. Me: <b>proceeds to not go in the creepvine forest forest for weeks</b>

A year late. But I wanted to wait until I got the game and then watch him play, anyways I want to see his reaction to the reapers
still waiting for him to give this game another chance
pewdiepie: did i call the spaceship a fish?<br>veterans: <b>COUGH (lifepod) COUGH</b>
<b>white</b>
Why is he picking so many mushrooms 😆 I love it
When you realise his channel has had 27b views wow
there&#39;s a monster is creepy.
<b>euw euw euw euw</b>
The scariest part is it’s mostly accurate to the real world
Someone should make a 10 hour alterra boot up
Just watched jacks playthrough again. Never watched yours. Thanks reccomended
play subnautiker
My brain is hurting
That fish was swedish
Same, I fear the sea and forests. Plus. Infinity
Pewds: I kinda want to play this in VR, nevermind ill get sick.<br><br>Veterans: I dont think being sick is what you should be worried about.
Pewds: plays for like 20 seconds and finds a biome I took 30 minutes to find <br><br>Veterans: (ง •_•)ง
I have watched Felix since 20134 or 14 and i legit dont even remember he played this last year! I remember he played it but was it really last year? Saw zerkaa played it in 2018 lol wtf
my trypophobia in this video : 📈📈
Ahh yes <br>Now I will subscribe
I don’t like pewdiepie
E
Things that make a reaper scary: fog that blocks your vision so he can stalk you, you hear him before you see him, he is probably the first aggressive type leviathan that You&#39;ve seen in the game so he scared you more bc you didnt expect it and now you have a slight fear of him. You will probably enconter him in a seamoth(for the first time is worse) and for attacking the little sub he has a &quot;special&quot; attack and it is designeg to bring you horor. So the fear of the reaper isnt actually him but the anticipation before the actual attack, whitch actually can&#39;t kill you or the seamoth in one hit.
&quot;maybe i should go to the ship???&quot;<br><br>me who has beaten the game several times &quot;you have ultimately lost&quot;
I like this guy just like over 100 million people do
Every survival game has a pet minecraft this one idk if terraria counts
DE DE DE DE DE DE
YES now i can even scare me more even whit the deep waters while waching pewds ty for helping my mental helth
“Made with Unity”
Wish he took it seriously...maybe he&#39;ll do below zero n take it seriously
Felix: This game is so beautiful!<br>Sea of Thieves: Am I a joke to you?
When anyone else says “imma get 1 million comments telling me I did it wrong” they are over exaggerating. When Felix says it he actually means at least 1 million people are going to yell at him saying he messed up. Crazy
555k likes
Cant believe he got Ruby so fast wow
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=343">5:43</a> Did he just say &quot;The ocean has always been scared of me&quot;?

What is scary about this game
Game looks garbage
Conor mcgregor!?
Pewds: &quot;Is there sharks in this game, be honest&quot;<br><br>Me: <b>laughs quietlly</b>
I just finished the game and came across this..... Wtf..... I DIDN&#39;T COLLECT MUSHROOMS!!
Imagine playing the game wrong
im really late, but yes there are sharks, i have one in my comtainment, i just got it last week so......
everyone’s first action in this game is filling your inventory up with acid mushrooms lmao
holy crap this was a year ago
love how pewdiepie thinks the spadefish was a reefback
PPPEEEWWWDDDIIIPPPIIIEEE
Imagine being 20 years too late to a game
<b>too lucky spawn</b>
lmao im so late but the fact he thought the floaters were titanium was just funny even though he was new to the game
I can&#39;t believe he approached the floater, saw it was called a floater, and said &quot;this is titanium&quot;
HuH
Pewdiepie: table coral 2 seconds later acid mushrooms! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=206">3:26</a>
People in the present day we all know that felix just quit and disappointed us
I loved this game until I saw that I had to go beyond the shallow area and for a guy with thalassophobia I do not think that I will like the game
&#39;&#39;Full Playtrough&#39;&#39;
Swedish subnautica!!!!! Yes
I have thalassophobia but this is still one of my favorite games
Fish: Does nothing but yellow clouds<br>Pewds: &quot;I can&#39;t murder them? That&#39;s unfair.&quot;
Every single player did this <br><br><br><br>The mushies they pink i need more
Pogg
I love that every lets play he does he always makes friends with a non-living object.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=201">3:21</a> that is literally the first thing i did when i got in the ocean
Pewdiepie is dababby <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=2">0:02</a>
And with that, the series will never continue again..
I cringed so hard when he picked up the acid mushrooms.
I like Mr. Fuel Tank
My man should play the forest next especially since the sequel is coming out soon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=213">3:33</a>
we all had the mushrooms phase at the beginning
Glad Jack told felix about this game
It really is a horror game 😂
I love how ppl call subnautica a horror game when on ps4 its a 7+ age rating lol
Food
Pewds: &quot;it&#39;s ok I&#39;m not scared I have knife.&quot;
very nice
For your first meal to have been a spade fish and not a peeper... wow
I just got this game and it is pretty good so far.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=185">3:05</a> <br><br>That’s the summary of this game

PewDiePie, Play Sea Of Thieves its... EPIC!
“I think I’m close to beating this” haven’t even gotten seaglide yet
I remember when i first played, i was in a cave and got exploded my the fcking cat/pufferfish.
Nu nu nu nu.<br>You get titanium from metal salvage, not limestone
It was like a flashbang when he was holding the flare
Ur in urainas
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
He needs to make more subnautica videos
I’ve been watching you for years, and after 5 years I just realized I haven’t subscribed I’m so sorry 💀💀💀
I like how he doesn’t waste any time he’s like alright we is doing this
Pewds probably never have been in a beach.
ok . so im kinda getting the hang of subnautica now. i am playing the 2014 subnautica now . i already built the essentials like survival knife, scanner, repair tool,o2 tanks ,  radiation suit, and also the habitat builder. now i have literally no idea what to build. im thinking of maybe building a rebreather or a compass. im scavenging the blueprints for the seaglide too. should i start  building my base because i have the habitat builder ? any tips ?
I am from estonia and scared of ocean
Felix: I think I’m close to beating it<br>Me:💀
Wait subnatica is a horror game
pewds: who will know what happens<br>me: everyone who watched jack
Why is there a clip option
It’s pronounced led not lead
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=300">5:00</a> casual ball scratching
pewds: maybe i should swim more toward the ship and see what i can find<br>subnautica veterans: nO
Still waiting for the next part
This game is fun
I think I’m close to beating it I’ve been playing for awhile. Jack with 75 episodes on his channel
I guess this is going to become the type of game I keep playing but never finish the story like MHWorld (60 hours in and not even on mid game yet)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=916">15:16</a> lol an aquarium to put in the aquarium you currently live in.

Felix: “I am so good at this game though.”<br>Me: You didn&#39;t fixed your life pod. You are not good at this game.
Felix: is afraid of a gasopod<br>Also Felix: isn’t afraid of a giant turtle squid
Subnautica subnautica subnautica
Always has been.
I’m really upset rn and I have to go to school and I can’t stop crying but thank god pewds exsists. Good thing I don’t have school tmr though I can cry all day
I really love torturing myself. Even though I have Thalassophobia, I still watch this 😀😀😀<br><br>Even though most of the time, I just listen to Felix&#39;s voice instead of looking at the screen hahahaha
Him scared of gasopods leviathans
I wish he had at least gotten far enough to see the G.U.N.
You are so close I&#39;m a noob😒
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=490">8:10</a> literally every subnautica player
Why every youtuber starts clauming tons of mushrooms
The aurora landed on an island
Next thing you know he finds jeb
felix is basically mincraft veteran doesnt know how to play minecraft
Pewds:i almost finished with the game me : laughing
I think I’m close to beating it me “HAHAHAHAHA no”
i know damn well all of us were going insane by the fact that he wasn’t scanning anything
pews: is scarred of oceans and dense forests <br>also pews: plays subnautica and slenderman
It took him that long to play subnotica
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=637">10:37</a> me when I have to watch my little siblings
Why are you playing in creative
pewdiepie like a seesaw, go game beautiful, then game ew
He should play the forest
The amount of mushrooms he harvests stresses me out
There&#39;s a sea dragon on 1200 dept
felix at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=676">11:16</a> looking for titanium <br>that piece of metal salvage :(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=1046">17:26</a> lol Felix thinks he’s safe from the leviathan
Pewdiepie if you swim behind the ships thrusters you can get a pet leviathan
play subnautica below zero
Imagine if you were that one butt that was useless but raced to the escape pod. Imagine if the captain died because you had called dibs.
Felix when he got the o2 tank:<br>Breathing is fun
Literally haven&#39;t watched him since the horror compilations but god <i>damn</i> I missed him
actually swimming to the big mothership for equipment would be the first thing i would do. judgin from the comments i wouldnt live long
shouldnt the first thing in a survival scenario be to find water? is this ocean not salty?
pewds:are there sharks in this game<br><br>me: nahh if thats ever thr case theres much worst
Pewds just confessed he never watched Jacksepticeye videos.
felix: i need titanium <br>me: literally screaming metal salvage
&quot;A million people: you played the game wrong&quot;
you ruined it
Hei
Watched about 20 different youtubers/ streamers play this WHY DO THEY ALL FILL THERE INVENTORY WITH ACID MUSHROOMS
<b>test</b>
Pewds: Doesn&#39;t have a scanner and wants to go to the aurora<br>Veterans: Anger intensifies
*grabs all the mushrooms in sight<br>WHY DO I HAVE SO MANY MUSHROOMS
whowwww
&quot;This is so pretty&quot;<br><br>wait until you get to the aroura when it explodes pewds... (people who played the game knows what i mean)
&quot;Will cause a tsunami&quot; BRUH ITS ALL WATER
Pronounce my name correctly
I can&#39;t tell if he is in survival or not
You should make a base
hahahahahhaaha
plock
Felix: I hate forests with a lot of wood<br><br>Me: that&#39;s what a forest is
Awfull editing dude, all the time zooming on yourself ...what for? It is not funny, you are not 12 so it is no excuse there. Damn annoying, left on 3rd minute
It big flash is the dieettiä fish
So sad he didnt invest in the game or story :(
pewdiepie i have  subnautica
Who else is holding there breath while watching this?
please for the love of god!! Scan everything. Its like a main story to do so.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=410">6:50</a><br>if u close ur eyes and listen to him he sounds like a girl 😭
Why did he stop playing this? 😢😢
Felix: &quot;wow this is a beautiful game&quot; <br>Two seconds later: &quot;Ew this game is disgusting&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=15">0:15</a><br>“Jack told me”<br><br>Of course he did
Imagine he found out about raft
felix : i dont like the ocean <br>me : i dont like google earth’s ocean
GuY&#39;S iT&#39;S a mINeCrAft RipOFf
dude.... 9 months
so mewdiepie , have you tried the new arrival krabby patties with Extra cheese there  at KRUSTY KKKKRABS ??
I have played lots of subnautica and never thought of using a flare for light before torch and seaglide
Pewds- scared of gasopods.<br>Pewds- loves reefbacks.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=834">13:54</a> :)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>you are :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
How did I forget he shaved his head?
I love how he calls this game fully finished
Pewdiepie be like this game is beutifull
fire no<br>&quot;fire gone&quot;
&quot;are there sharks in this game?&quot;<br>Umm no, but... You will see
i miss this
Bruh I don&#39;t know why he stopped playing this series was pretty good
I get really angry when people make mistakes in subnautica or spore so this is pretty much just me raging
My Sweden friends said hello :P
Hey Pewds please finish this series thank you
PewDiePie clearly didn’t put much thought into the power of a tsunami.
Hey it’s the kid from stranger things
this was so hard to watch felix lol
play raft
Pewdiepie: is thier sharks in this game?<br><br>Me: well yes, but actually no.
In case anyone has not yet told you, this world is not procedurally generated.<br>The map is fixed and there is a story plot that goes along with it.
I play subnotica on xbox
this game would be amazing if i didnt got stuck every time i played it
He basically made the knife cause he thinks its cool and did not think that he will made it to improve his suvival.<br><br>Typical Pewdiepie😂😂😂
Felix might be the minecraft king but jacksepticeye  is the subnautica king
espanis
This game is a horror game for those with Thallassophobia.(The fear of large bodies of water)
Finish the game or peril
Ahh yes, another series felix didn&#39;t finish
Those gas mask manatees sound like fricken Tusken raiders.
Pls finish game
du spelar fel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=874">14:34</a> WHAT IS YOU?!!?!?! DEAD!!! THAT WHAT YOU IS!!!!!
First thing everyone does in this game is pick up acid mushrooms.<br>The map isn&#39;t procedurally generated, your map is the same as mine.
Watersheep guides him in this world
Хоть он и не русский но.. смотреть можно
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=220">3:40</a> its a reef back leviathan
U da god
Felix : Are there sharks in this game? be honest!<br>Veterans: <b>psycho laugh</b>
Still waiting for him to finish the game
It’s called a gas o pod and it is pronounced peeper and the exposing fish has sulfur
I would love to see Felix play below zero
So  Swedens explode so that fish is swedens
Hey fellas this is a noob question, but may I ask how some people see the goggles on there screen and some dont? Is that just an option in the game menu or what?
I’ve waited 5 years for this
I’m so upset that he didn’t continue this ughh
Felix “this game is beautiful.”two minutes later Felix “eww are they f*cking that’s dis disgusting
a
Felix: &quot;It&#39;s so pretty, I love it!&quot;<br>Also Felix: Never been underwater
I love how he passes right by the metal salvage when he&#39;s looking for titanium
KAPO
its so funny watching how similar our gameplay was, litterally its like he copied me lol
“i’m most scared of oceans and forests with a lot of trees” <b>plays minecraft and subnautica</b>
Have you played SOMA?
Dawg this game is awsome
Having just gone through the Subnautica experience, watching Pews jump into the game blind is so oddly enjoyable; every time he gets amazed or freaked out, I’m like: <b>I feel you</b>
This is hard to watch <br>-subnautica veteran.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=179">2:59</a> svenska ja
Wow, he noped right after the first monster, that was epic
big iron
no there are animals bigger than sharks
Ja vi exploderar
I saw one meme and now I&#39;m watching this whole letsplay.
I like when he plays games but he dont play games that much any more really except among us but other wise idk
Lol that’s exactly what I did when I first played: grab as many mushrooms as I possibly can 😂
Pewds: sees gastropods &quot; WHAT the hell is that&quot;<br><br>Me: You ain&#39;t see nothin yet
Never even finished the game
&quot;This is how we fish in Sweden, PLUCK PLUCK&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=43">0:43</a> sven no. don&#39;t worry felix you there&#39;s a nice cat poster in the game. im sorry for your loss
You suck a this
Pewds: “I think I’m close to beating it”<br>Everyone who’s played subnautica: it goes deeper
Your so cringey
Hej

If you haven&#39;t already you should play ark and record it.
ew ew ew ew!!!! this is so gross. - pewds
Anyone else feel like Auto is worse quality than 1080p even if Auto = 1080p, or is that just me?
Hey Hey
You sound scarily like MxR!
blacksheep dsp bodypaint
This was soooooooooooooooo funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ou can live under water
There’s no sharks in this game. There’s something more terrifying
If you like pretty survival games, play The Long Dark! No zombies also so that’s refreshing.
anyone come back to rewatch hoping he finishes the rest of the game?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=220">3:40</a> minutes in the game and Pewdiepie alredy saw reefback. World record
Jeg kan rigtig godt lide det her spil 🇩🇰🇩🇰<br>I really like this game🇺🇸
Hur mår du
me before: subnautica is lame <br>after seeing pewdipie : we live for subnautica
U should try the Forrest
Hey you should go to the ship for good
Did anyone else hella relate when he immediately grabbed all of the mushrooms? 🙋🏽‍♀️😂
At my school i sell G fuel and your flavor is the best seller.
*I think I’m so close to beating it, because I have been playing for a while”<br><br>𝙋𝙚𝙬~
Me:<br>Playing subnautica while watching this is epic gamer moment<br>Felix:<br><b>gets vored by panel</b>

Annoying man-kid plays with head switched off.
Yo man I really love this game.

Hi
i subscribed to you
Sad that pewds hasnt returned to this game :(
My parents were arguing and shouting when i watched this. This took my mind off of it. Thanks pewds.
Well Felix doesn&#39;t have to worry about batteries...
Plot twist: when you escape the Aroura at the beginning, you’re the imposter escaping the ship after killing the crew mates.
6 months already?? felt like it was yesterday
It would have coursed a tsunami but due to gravity the aurora would have crashed fast there for your ship still wouldn’t have sunk
I’m noob I just got the game a need to watch a play through cuz I don’t know what to do
Lol fart fish
“I think I almost beat the game.”<br><br>Veterans: <b>sigh</b>

Damn he really found reefbacks that close to the lifepod? I didn&#39;t see one until I ventured like 300 meters away from the  lifepod.
I just got major amnesia the dark descent vibes when he said &quot;Just me and my friend fire extinguisher&quot;

The funny thing is the fist things he grabs are 26266352616275453728 acid mushrooms....
İ like how pewds too lazy to a introduction
&quot;two things realy scare me. the ocean, and forests with alot of WOOD in it&quot;
The way he said hey hey I was dead
I have this but I need my game pass:(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=568">9:28</a> do you die when you die smh
Everyone’s reaction to the exploding fish “AHHHHHHHHHHHHH”
this game gave me thalassophobia
I miss this:(
Suddenly huge boost in Subnautica sales out of nowhere.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=534">8:54</a> famous last words
Why is he always so late to games like these
Little did he know he can play it in vr
I just finished subnautica I’m proud of myself!
<b>quarantine day 57:</b> revisiting the good old gaming week
i have subnautica but never played it yet. i will get to download it soon
The first thing everyone did in subnautica : got a shit ton of acid mushrooms
You should play astroneer it’s really fun it’s also a survival game
is there sharks in this game? me: um yes but no
2 hours in I think I’m close to beating the game👌🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=43">0:43</a> he would have even survived this m8
10:6 there are no sharks <br><br><br><br><br>But there are more terifying things
there&#39;s legit no sharks in this game but something much much worse
Felix <b>takes tons of acid mushrooms</b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Veterans &#39;&#39;That&#39;s cute&quot;
(in swedish accent) WHERE WAS COCOMELON INTRO
Hey hey subnatica
Welp now I know what I’m doing on my 5.5 hour car ride today
Pewds died by oxygen at start<br><br>Me: dies 4 times by putterfish in caves at start
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=344">5:44</a> nope, most people find that horrifying
your so proooo!
Underwater tablet that actually works
I asked my mom is she can buy subnautica and she said: Su-na-u-hi-ca????
Did he stop playing?
i was eaten by the metal panel guys i&#39;m sorry<br><br>-Felix 2020
hah I’m watching this even though I have thalassophobia
why does every single youtuber shit their pants at the sight of the gasopods....
You would think that playing hundreds of horror games that involve light sources, he would pay attention to the fuel of the lightsource, but no..<br>Randomly using his lamp during daytime, watching the energy drain.. Also picked up over 40 mushrooms, and comes by some more and thinks, wow i&#39;ll definitely need more of these.<br>Mate, starting to think you&#39;re not a real gamer
Felix don’t gooo to the aurora do it for your sanity
I am sorry pewdieipei but i do not like your voice
Bleach to disinfect water.   Aaaa
Felix: the ocean has always been scary to me.                                                                 Me: why are you playing this game this game can really terrifying.
Furlud papyrus:<br>Pewdiepie:papyrus? Where sans?
are there sharks in this game?<br><br><b>far worse,my child</b>
why does every youtuber picks the acid mushroom as the first thing felix did and markiplier and I think jack
Can you send me the right cumputer<br>And the game on it
Underwater stuff is always really scary for me, too, Pewds. Kudos to you for playing this! It&#39;s so cool to watch!
&quot;It&#39;s just you and me, Mister fuel tank.&quot; &quot;Okay, pewds.&quot; I laughed so hard! XD
You&#39;re the best YouTuber I love your videos and I and I love you
You play the game best you are better than me I just got the game so you are better than me and you&#39;re the best YouTuber on Nemo on YouTube
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=153">2:33</a> nah bruh, that wouldn&#39;t cause a tsunami.. it would definitely cause some giant waves/ripples but they would subside. Nuclear bombs have been detonated under the ocean and even those waves caused by the nukes can&#39;t match the power of a tsunami. Tectonic plates shifting under the ocean is some serious shit! It&#39;s literally an earthquake underwater. And we already know how strong earthquakes on land can be...

It&#39;s not a Horror Survival Game. It&#39;s a Terror Survival Game.
Dude you have no idea, you got a long way to go
I installed this game and quickly uninstalled it after discovering that I have thalassophobia
Play rain world it’s fun
Derix it may not have sharks but has giant monsters so be careful!
HEY HEY

Pewdiepie <b>looks at floater</b><br>&quot;This is definitely titanium&quot;
Minecraft cave sounds are scarier
Pewds: I think i&#39;m close to beating the game cuz i&#39;ve been playing for a while<br>Everyone: <b>Should we tell him? No? k</b>
Not procedurally generated, its a standard map. always the same.
What version do you have? EA or the FG
is it a swedish thing because of year walking? (idk if that was really a thing or not)
there some reapers
“PAPYRUS, Where’s Sans?”
Pewdiepie: Is there sharks in this game? <br><br>Me: <b>laughs in leviathan.</b>
EmBR did it first.
Yo gasopods are the best things in the game ngl
So happy he’s playing subnautica
This game is given me anxiety for no reason
“I’ve been playing for a while think I’m close to beating it”
Just feeding the video more algorithm metrics.
Is he the first one to not be initially terrified of reefbacks?
Felix’s reaction is giving me life 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=131">2:11</a> why is it not in fire this is so wierd

Hi
Pewdiepie:sadly i eat Boomirang<br><br>Me:I eat puffin
Imagine if this game was VR... 😐
Me waiting for him to see the reaper Leviathan😈😈😈😈
I CAN BEAT THIS GAME IN 3 HOURS!
He discovered that catching fish was a thing a lot faster than I did... For a while, I thought they were just background sprites to make the environment pretty...
Felix: &quot;Ew ,ew, ew! This game is discusting!&quot;<br>1 second later<br>&quot;Look at this, gorgeous.&quot;
What if Pewds is actually Conner McGregor.
“I think I’m close to beating it, because I’ve been playing it for awhile” (Just imagining Jack snickering watching this)
русские есть?)
I completed it yesterday
Subnautica is like 75 irl days long boi
Felix: I&#39;m scared of forests with wood<br>Me: Hmmmm

&quot;Breathing is my thing now&quot;<br>- Felix 2020
I like how he thought it was an indie game with not much depth and then got so surprised by everything
You never know when you’ll need lubricant pewds-2020
Well ok everyone reading this have a great day and have a nice everything and stay safe
I love subnotica and I hope you do too
Met my first Reaper Leviathan today. It was scary. When I was swimming away I could see its tentacles in front of me and I somehow survived. 😅
OMG GAME
I&#39;m french and I like you videos,you can translate your videos,I understand 90% of english
Pewds if you ascend to quick the oxygen in your lungs will expand , making them explode.
Pewds looks like the drummer in an indie band
Nope. no sharks pewds.
Who is watching this in quarantine 🤧☠️👨🏻‍🦳
this game is not generated its all hand made
Varför härmar du matinbum
Pop
Pewdiepie: I&#39;m Swedish we explode <br>Crashfish: I&#39;m going to end this man&#39;s whole career
Why does everyone do the same things first episode. They just go into the ocean balls-deep without any foreplay. They get scared of the bulbasaur dudes and do a lot of acid.
Play Trainz a new era
I want to see this series come back
“Is there sharks in this game?” Literally 2 seconds later sand shark enters the battle
Akulonok TURURU AKUIONOK TURURU<br><b>KAKOI UI DURAK</b>
Pewds harvesting all those &#39;mushrooms&#39;  like he&#39;s playing minecraft
felix: those are evil<br>me: cries in gaspod
The most famous content maker in the world😎✌
After not watching PewDiePie for awhile, its nice to know he isn&#39;t loud and obnoxious as he used to be in older videos, no offense lol
From Malaysia ❤
Every single human being who plays Subnautica fills up their entire inventory with acid mushrooms in the beginning
Simp
😁👍
Me looking at Felix, knowing the main plot and end of the Subnautica: <br><b>Felix:</b> I think I&#39;m close to beating the game.<br>Me: <b>laughs evily</b> You&#39;ll know soon ;)
idk if anyone has suggested this but i would love for you to play bendy.. You playing horror games is my favourite thing on earth
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=153">2:33</a> good poimt. But the tsunami would be long gonenat this poimt tho.

He already played this game though a while back
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=725">12:05</a> Felix: whatever ewan me: hey that’s me
Imagine if there was a megaladon in this.
“That’s ok I’m not scared” Just wait... wait and see...
Reading all the comments makes my pp hurts sksgakakaja
About Fucking Time
It hurts me physically how little he knows about this game
this would be better in vr
I watched EVERY episode of Jack&#39;s series. Thank you, Pewds
IT IS IN FACT A HORRER GAME I WONDER IF HE WILL GET A HEART ATTACK BY THE GHOST LEVIATHANS
Jesus Christ... Pewds atlast you played this shit. It&#39;s like I was waiting for you for years to play this.
i have my best friend, fire extinguisher.... &quot;it is normal to feel lonely after a long time without psychological contact, subject may befriend inanimate objects.&quot;
he should play the titanfall 2 campaign
Love this. Like and sub.
Sorry if I’m a little late but you can get titanium from those metro thing on the ground then turn them into titanium
<b>lmao</b>
He not even close to beat game I’ve been  playing it for a month and I’m still not close

Who else is watching this is 2020? <br><br><br>Like if you are!!
Damn I wanna pick up the cave sulfur and those metal salvage parts that he didn&#39;t
I was waiting for him to meet the Leviathan lol
HE FOUNF A LEVIATHAN THAT I AHEV BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR AGES HE FOUNF IT IN THE FIRST 2 MIMUTES
It’s so funny watching him do his own thing grabbing hundreds of mushrooms
He this guy is pretty cool. He needs more followers.
где русские субтитры?
The first thing that anyone does when play Subnautica is fill their storage container with acid mushrooms
&quot;I must be close to the end of this game, I&#39;ve been playing for a while.&quot; <br>Little did Felix know this game is about 15 hours long if not more.
YESSSSSSSSS FINALLLYYYYYYY YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Action online is copying you lol
“Maybe I should swim closer to the ship.”<br><br>:)
Pewdiepie: Its so refreshing to play a well made survival game. <br><br><br>Pewdiepie three seconds later: This game is Disgusting!!!
Philip DEfranco hearing pews say let&#39;s, <br><b>aah shit here we go again</b>
Find a cuddle fish and you can make it your buddy
Tip for felix: You can propel your self through water faster if you spray the fire extinguisher behind you while swimming
Pewds says he’s close to finishing it while swimming in the safe shallows<br><br>You poor bastard
Pewds: it seems we don’t have too much storage in here<br><br>Also pewds: fills it mostly with acid mushrooms
Omg pewdiepie second time watching this Series please play subnautica below zero its currently a beta but its really well made still its already near done
We All Know Why He Put That Scuba Mask...<br><br><br><br><br><br>B A B Y S H A R K
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS54qL3GeaI&amp;t=1046">17:26</a>
its funny to think that every subnautica first time players fills their inventory with acid mushrooms (including me)
Anyone play this game on Ps4?
Felix has already embraced his inner subnautica player by dancing to the music during a time when you really should be trying to stay alive
Pewds please make a series out of this

Jacksepticeye: recommends Subnautica to Pewds<br>: Jacksepticeye watching him play<br>&quot;What in the Non-Subnautica god f*** is this s***&quot;
Subnutica isn&#39;t a horror game it a survival game

Forest with a lot of woods and ocean are scary? next game is green hell i guess
Play journey to the Savage planet
Grabs floaters: “these are definitely titanium” lol
Sharks are the least of ur worries in this game
You Should Try No Man&#39;s Sky Beyond its an open universe Adventure Game you can Find Earth Like Planet visit planets you can explore Them, some time there are planets who can give you gusbumps Alart Felix Don&#39;t Be scare when you visiting a Ghost Planet or toxic planets, you can Build Base on any planet Like minecraft, you can fight online player if they pop up on your planet or on the galexy, So Many Ships Infinity Planets infinity galexy, and mainly all animals are creepy, last time a peranaha look like gaint fist eat me, its an awesome game to you should try<br>third person view and first person view you can play in any one
