Not the last foldable phone. I&#39;m using one right now it&#39;s a Samsung galaxy Z fold 3
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=92">1:32</a> the moment when he was about to destroy the phone
Bro do you still got this phone???
I believe android and most android apps just refuse to let you hold your phone upside down, when there&#39;s no right-side-up it gets confusing. <br>discord is one notable exception until they fixed it with the latest update. no clue.
Foldables have finally came to the point that they are usable...
I like the waterfall screen effect a lot… More so than the current foldables
Hahahha. His face when he unfolded it it, amazing. 😂
That is the worst phone I have ever seen it’s crazy how far foldable phones have come since then
Looks like junk.
I would like to see that childs mode in One UI.
r/agedlikemilk
Surely a paid review from samsung 😂.i have this phone and it is still going well.
the noises or not the phone, obviously you&#39;re folding it wrong
Hideous
&quot;It kinda makes some noises sometimes when you touch it the wrong way&quot;<br>MKBHD out of context
How that title has aged
Janky translation… well I bet it would be better than what American could translate things in Chinese, if they would ever do :)
This didn&#39;t age well
Watching this on my fold 3 is amazing, lol. I still smile and get excited like I did when I first opened it in September. First piece of tech I&#39;ve been this excited for since the ps3, and I&#39;ll continue to buy folding phones from now on
Well this dinner age well 😂
This video, and all these top comments, didn&#39;t aged well.
Bruh there is more folding phones

The last and first he he he ha, he don&#39;t knew the future in that moment
The title of this video didn&#39;t age well
Folding phones will never be it unless the can get that line out of the middle on the screen who wants to see that especially when ur watching a video or playing a game for jus in general
Folding phones look so dumb. I hate it
Thanks ✌🏼😍❗️🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
Why is this just now recommended to me in 2021 going into 2022? And why don&#39;t I ever see your videos in my recommendations anymore and I&#39;m subscribed and have alerts. Damn YouTube algorithm
Fine wine
The intro😂
sorry bro but...
This didnt age well
Fast Forward .......best big smartphone of the year lol
Well, it doesn’t seem to be the last anymore now, does it?????
Yet 2 years later : <b>nope</b>  :)
So my qestion is what is the name of iz and whats the price
And boy was he wrong
Watching this two Years later on my Galaxy Z Flip 3 is kinda surreal...
And then it turned out not to be the last.
Hasn’t Samsung released like 3 of these??
This man is wearing a sneak attack podcast shirt, respect
&quot;last&quot;<br>Samsung: well you see this is where you&#39;re wrong
What&#39;s your opinion on the fold 3 Marques
SAMSUNG....
This aged like fine milk
So cool as I watch on my fold 3 hahaha
Samsung fold : the last you say
Here we are using samnsung  z fold 3
Galaxy is better... than chinese corporation kk
Every phone is foldable If you are strong enough
I just wanted to rewatch this to remind myself on how shit this was
You were wrong about the last folding phone part
All phones can technically fold but might not unfold
This didnt age well
Didn&#39;t you just talked about a folding phone lately ha!?
First bit was a flex
so that was a lie
Whats the phone name?
And then OPPO dropped the King.
This is an ugliest thing that I ever seen in my life
😭😭😭 i wish i can have expensive device that i cant afford 😔
❤️💗
Shit.
Very strange phone
From the start I was like why are they going backwards...?
First wave of innovation
but why should i need a folding phone?? What&#39;s the necessity??
It&#39;s not the last
This phone is so ugly
I don&#39;t know that if this phone is the first folding phone. But It was&#39;nt definitely the last. Galaxy Z fold 3 is out boiis!
It’s a nice indeed but the technology is move first
Last huh?<br>Are you messing with the technology?
So whos gonna tell him
heh i wish
i loves you brother maybe i only one who follow your eye contact 👀
why Last we have still few more coming
太丑了吧
&quot;last&quot;
Haye Sir Your&#39;s Information is very Unique, I like You
That doesn&#39;t work all over world phones
Price???
That&#39;s india
Dang this phone is really cool. I think that if it the issues were fixed (hinge, operating system, thickness, etc.) it would better than the Galaxy Z Fold. I think the ability to open one app on one side and one on the other is really cool and the ability to use the main camera to take selfies is cool, and the Z Fold doesn&#39;t have that.

Nice video
Samsung
Et
I just saw an ad of an moviea and all of my favourite actors are there now there is no need to watch this video. LOL😂😂😂😂
It&#39;s not durable bro.!!
Which company phone is this
Porcaria
You got 8 ways to rotate n 6 work! Not 16 and 14! 😌
Weird looking moder phone end 2021
I&#39;m from the future and it won&#39;t happen :v
Has there ever been a phone that maybe has one screen behind the other and the screens just slide out flush next to each other ? I definitely could see that working especially if they had edge screens and it definitely could be done with multiple screens in that set up .
Bad ass folding tablet that happens to have cellular capabilities that needs an really great case .
Why would people buy that ? Folding phones look ugly
👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿💩💩💩
It&#39;s ugly, no thanks..
Can i had 1 of that😔im using for my vlog..thank you..
Well this didn&#39;t age well
Cool man🙏❤️
Wow
Huawei mat
I&#39;m not a fan of any fucking folding phone, what is it for?, if you need a laptop go buy one for yourself..🙄
👍👍
This is tappar
This aged well, didn&#39;t it?
Susah kalau udah jadi fanboy apple lu mah, betah di goblokin terus
I&#39;m from Brazil, here there&#39;s no black Youtuber that tests cell phones, so there&#39;s no way for me to know how the device&#39;s camera works on black people, I finally found one but I don&#39;t speak English
And 2years down the line we have samsung Z fold
Sony to me is like half of LG and Samsung mixed together. They sometimes come up with excellent products but sometimes wreck it completely with the funkiest experimental designs.
Watching this on a galaxy fold lmao
I&#39;m glad you give them the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; and not just knock it because it&#39;s ugly....... full stop.<br>It&#39;s horrible 😂 but at least they gave it a shot
We have Fold 3 now :)
I would love so much to have that I think it is so cool I really want it 😞
You were so wrong about it being first or last lol. There was one before this &quot;Axon M&quot; and there is ones after this one.
The folding trend will soon die out..
Samsung z flip: Am I a joke to you
Boom! ❤️
It&#39;s funny to watch this now on my galaxy fold 3
I am biting iPhone 13 Max pro… but idea behind phone and mini iPad i love it
I know this is an old video but the title, 😆. First and last folding phone
Nokia: am I a joke to you.
watching this on my fold 3
That title did not age quite so well
The unfolding at the beginning was so wince inducing
This video title didn&#39;t age well
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣  that intro 💪🏾
Hey I’m from the future(2021) now Samsung has released Fold3 and it’s a beast. People are crazy about it and the phone itself is spectacular
Are you sure this is the last phone ?
This video title didn’t age very well
Video didn&#39;t age well
this shows up in my recommendation. hahaha  i thought this hints an end but now actually we are having a lot of folding phones available 😂 funny it is.
POV you watched this  in 2021 for ironys sake because it&#39;s obvious not the last folding phone
Got anything to add now?
Not the last I think now.
Good talk
That wasn’t the last.
And last lol
Great
How did u get the scar on your had
Watching this on my Z Fold3 is really cool.
Watching 2 years later with the galaxy z fold 2 😊
When you compare this model from 2 years ago vs  the galaxy z fold 3,  it&#39;s crazy to see the development of the technology on the folds phones.
Now we can say they are here
That video title didn&#39;t age well..!
Mm yes the last
Bending phone
Except it&#39;s not
This is just horrible, i wouldent use this, would feel like some sort of tricked fool.
70% of video is only about complaining the device design fucking shut up it&#39;s great new design best for gammers.
A work in progress
And now foldable phones are released every year from giant companies. 🤣🤣
Tbh I wish I could have this phone, sadly it&#39;s super expensive-
The title didn&#39;t age that well
I&#39;m here, 2 years later, and the SS Fold3/Flip made  revolutionary phones
Complex phone

Hi
After 2 years we live in a world with such shits
Yeah yeah the Galaxy fold has a better hinge and durability and performance and screen and software….<br><br>But does it have baby mode? Exactly, that’s what I thought.
คนไทยหลายคนไม่มีเงินซื้อนอกจากมหาเศรษฐี
I like it
Guess Who is here on 2021 with the zfold 3

Haha ........ The &quot;last&quot; and the &quot;first&quot;.... 😀
How to get this phone iam from india
Samsung Fold 3 says hi
did this age well?<br><br>no.
How wrong was this guy
It kinda makes some noises sometimes when you touch it the wrong way 😂😂🤷‍♂️
Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’. In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals.
I got recommend in 2021 😂<br>Where now samsung rules with fold3
Now it&#39;s looks horrible
Price broo?
Z fold 3 add playing on this video epic
Why is it recommended by youtube now??
First folding phone
Only one word for this phone is &#39; useless &#39;
What about galaxy fold 3
Its kinda funny watching this in 2021
.
What about Samsung z fold
Lol looks so funny in 2021 with fold 3
So wrong lol
See you in 10 years after another recommendation
What kind logarithms is it after 2 year they suggested me this Video
The title aged well
interesting to come back to this as the third generation of the galaxy fold phones have now been released
It feels like useless.<br>I don&#39;t see myself using it
well This didnt age well 😂
&quot;and last&quot;
Seeing this video after the galaxy z fold 3 has released.🥲
My cats paw typed this
What&#39;s the point of a foldable phone. The only one I like was the Motorola
The first folding phone was the iPhone 6.
Good  phone  bro <br>අදරේයි 💖💖
At most, 14 works and we would wait five more years then. 😁
Imagine if he folded it the wrong way 😂😂😂😂
This aged well
Name sounds like a dessert.
Yeah these are ugly af
My question is why?
I think all mobile companies should focus on building a battery that last for 48 hours on single charge with out usage restrictions... No matter what the feature of the phone EOD phone should not get drained with many unused features..
I only got 1 question: why in the fuck would I or anyone want this? Who would like to awkwardly and carefully fold his phone?
This phone is super uncomfortable.. I m still happy with my iphone
and iphone users will still claim to be &quot;innovative&quot;
This phone is dead ☠️ already the price killed it
You should do a review of your thoughts in this video now that the Samsung Z Fold is about to get its third generation
I don’t agree with your statement about being first. That’s the reason you are reviewing this and we are watching it, so mission accomplished for them
The title makes it seem like you never heard of flip phones. A better title would be The First Smartphone With a Foldable Screen.
How do you put a case on this
Oppo x 2021 best one
why?
POCO X3 AND OTHER PHONES ARE FAR BETTER THAN THIS PHONE
Is there actually any supposed benefit to a folding phone? Except for companies proving that they could actually do it?
It kinda makes some noises sometimes when you touch it the wrong way 😂
Weird flex hahahahah
I don’t want a folding phone
Foldable phones are useless I don&#39;t know why people keep thinking it&#39;s the future
Please don&#39;t Shoot Chinese products bro man🙏
2021 PEOPLE? <br>GALAXY FOLD 2 ALL READY OUT!
The scandalous cupboard descriptively occur because horn internally disagree on a old-fashioned fear. violet, acidic point
If you do buy a foldable please buy samsung gakaxy fold2 im happy with it, great hardware and samsung always has good quality
Folding phone could be tricky plus not well designed just waste of money
Yeaaa no....
I died when he say.... now ur phone looks like an accordion 😂😂
All phones are foldable, once.
fold both ways
wtf is this
i mean why ?!
I think its the 6 and 6+  that folds
“The first (and last) folding phone” well that didn’t last very long
best intro ever period.
My phone can also fold <br><br><br>once
Ad are playing on this video even after a year !!!!
It&#39;s more like bent less like a fold
This title aged poorly
✨weird flex✨
Fold in with extra screen on the back
Its better to take your time and release your products later than rush and make headlines with the risk if it being crappy
“Last folding phone”<br><br>Galaxy Fold, Z-Flip, and Motorola Razr: “allow us to introduce ourselves”

Samsung Spent 8 Years designing a foldable phone. While Huawei designs it in 2 seconds
Folding phones still look like ass today 😂
What’s the intro song tho
remember Jesus die on a cross for our sins and rose again repent get saved he is coming soon God bless you all 💘🙏
It look like a tablet
weird flex lol
How wrong he has
A flip phone but bigger and more expensive basically
iPhone 6 Plus was the first folding phone
Wait a minute, you&#39;re calling it a phone?
Seltsamer Winkelschneider, aber ok
Folding phones are a BAD IDEA
Do Huawei Mate X2
srilanka
Thanks you
In my opinion folding phones are the worst possible design as this video shows
Remember that episode of mythbusters when they made a car run with squared wheels and it worked but it wasn&#39;t viable, this is the same thing but with phones.
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=370">6:10</a> i got that from cat s60 it does work from leaft right, down and upside too
what is the name of that phone
why is there a same ad popping again and again
We&#39;ve come a long way in two years.
Stupid phone
all i said during this video is ew
Its like the first smartphone!  It will get better
2021- Press X to doubt
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=169">2:49</a> &quot;It kinda makes some noises sometimes when you touch it the wrong way&quot; 💀💀😂🤣
i don’t really see the point of these folding phones i mean it’s convenient for keeping bigger screens in smaller areas like your pocket but apart what other kind of things can it do that normal smart phones can i mean you can open different tabs on a phone
This didn’t age well
The oldschool Motorola flip-phones were legendary and extremely well built. These .. &#39;things&#39; .. just don&#39;t come even close...
This aged like milk
Everything about this device makes me feel sick
Ah yes, here in 2021 and can confirm it isn&#39;t the last
Fold 2: hold my beer
It looks like an accordion
Oh my gosh sorry I changed my account but now I&#39;ve subscribed
.
haha, last...
The most impressive thing about it is baby mode
fortnite, and mark ass brownie
Why last?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=6">0:06</a> sounds like ball joints cracklin&#39;
ur wrong
Can we call or talk using this phone ?
Technical Guruji..  👌
If iPhone 6 was the first folding phone <br>Then <br>Samsung Note 7 was the first terrorist certified bomb phone (try to get the joke Samsung fanboys)
The charging thing must be because of the heat from the charging. The Samsung screen likely has some heat resistance so that it doesn&#39;t warp
Cut to 2020 and nobody’s using these
Little did he know
Aap English meaning Hindi mein bolo
Best intro
The last folding phone. dont you feel stupid now
flexpai . hmm.. not so interesting
Bro this is not the first and last foldable phone because huwawi has done a foldable phone
Fold 2 also launched!<br>By the who is here in 2020 <br>HIT LIKE TO KNOW <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>WHO IS ALONG WITH YOU !
We indians support samsung it is depressing to think that we dose not have our own smartphone or pc company yet but we think that cheaper and afordable with quality is good not expensive just for showoff.
Saingannya Gadgetin
It looks fragile. So unappealing.
so they don&#39;t have any camera...do they?
People are coming up with the weirdest shit nowadays.

Yeah umm galaxy z fold 2
They should make it were you can detach both screens and reconnect it so you would have 2 phones and 1 tablet
It’s a literal flip phone.
Title didn&#39;t age well

Who else is watching on Samsung galaxy fold but 2
z fold and flip are here
6.9 million views ayeeeeeee
Samsung and Motorola: are you sure about that?
The sound of the unfolding is so satisfying.
E
If i was making a review, i would just say: shit, this is just shit
Bra you must be joking that&#39;s a phone bra not a joke and try asking Samsung for how long it took them just to create it
This video didn’t age well
I guess this wasn&#39;t the last
&quot;the First foldable phone&quot;<br><b>Laughs in Nokia 9300</b>
I was rewatching this video today, and someone tell me why it&#39;s auto quality was 360p? I know that my MacBook Pro is almost 10 years old, but it does HD! I should know because I changed it manually and the quality was AMAZING
NEVER SEE A UGLY LOOKING PHONE LIKE THIS
Buy samsung a21s foldable phone

Between the 16/14 rotation comment and Thanos i screeeeeamed 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dear marques bro.. I have an idea of new future electronics if u help me this will make a new...
Who da fuck would buy a bumdass phone like dis
little did he know...
U.G.L.Y phone. Seems like it just folds just because it’s folds. Tried to cool n didn’t.

Hi from the future, my note 20 ultra is better!
Well the title has aged poorly
He lied to us
Want to buy
Ya really, it&#39;s the last folding phone?😒
this was not the last one
Last that&#39;s what you think
Whenever you fold a stack of paper the stuff on the inner curve pushes out whilst the stuff on the outer curve seems to not push out as far. As this is the case, why doesn&#39;t the screen pop off given that it is being stretched?
This aged pretty well.
See by my channel On yt.. Like&amp;Sub u have From me. Nice Video!!!
Samsung has entered the chat
Why do ppl like folding fone ...? Just to have a bigger screen? Get ur self xperia if u like to have a cinematic view ...fuq folding fones ...
We&#39;ve definitely gone a long way from this!!
Tablets : exists <br>This phone : ima about to end this man&#39;s whole carrier
I&#39;ve never laughed so much at a mkbhd video.
Ok this is definetly not the last anymore
I will cry always I told that phone, don&#39;t trust that phone 😢
Well it wasn&#39;t the last folding phone.
This aged well
Well the title seems a bit off in 2020
Bro z fold 2
this title didn&#39;t age well...
The sound of the screen folding scares me that’s it gonna cracked and I would bet that screen will be almost the same for the phone to replace
Awesome 😊👍😊👍😊👍😊
Yeah sure
A lesson to learn here : never hire a bad hands on agents. MKBHD charged fire on this because of that 😂😂😂😂
Just imagine sitting down on a bench forgetting that, the phone is in your jeans 👖 back pocket 😭
This phone is literally cosplaying as one of those accordion buses lol
Everytime he unfolds the phone, he looks like he&#39;s about to vomit
MKBHD: this is the last one.<br><br><br><br>1 year later: so you&#39;ve thought.
WEIRD FLEX BUT OK
Ah yes &quot;phone&quot;.
Fake. Other companies like iPhone and nextbit have already made foldables
Normally with Plainrock124…
This feels more like a physical digital book precursor, if that makes sense. The rubber, I’m not touching it so idk the quality. But it seems like everything else it’s ideal; except extreme heat. As an Arizonan, I’m still waiting for a normal smartphone that can be used atleast 105F normally. But most of the best weather rubber components for outdoor things, (chairs, awnings, wheels [not quite cars], etc.), have an extremely limited life compared to elsewhere in terms of looks &amp; usability. That $h!+ can’t survive 1 summer in the car out here is my bet.
Do phone companies always take the phones they gave to review?wat diffrent one phone would make to such big companies !!?
It’s just missing an Apple logo, then it becomes revolutionary
In case you were watching this to see if you should buy it, fuck you
Well that was a lie
And Samsung just launched the another new Folding phone. What now Marq? Haha
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=91">1:31</a> imagine if he accidentally fliped it the wrong way..

folding in is better than folding out <br><br>Mate X: I beg you pardon?
Hi. I:m from kerala
Boy was he wrong with the title...
I&#39;d rather stick with my Nokia Brick
MKBHD:What will these look like in 5 more years from today<br>Me: Most probably it&#39;ll look almost the same as now but with a bitten apple symbol😂
Want the last but ok
Ngl that baby mode seems really creative.
No
`it kind of makes a noise when you touch it the wrong way`
Valo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=170">2:50</a> .....sounds like a girl I know

Royole really tried to kill folding phones before they even took off, huh?
A man tried to fold a nokia in Arizona <br>  <b>ARIZONA CRATER WAS FORMED</b>
I can see these things going the same way as the 3D tv, everyone is impressed with them initially but they just never take off. We just aren’t anywhere near the technological level to make this practical for most people, maybe in 15-20 years the tech will catch up with the concept but idk. Right now, and for the foreseeable future these things are like the Jeep Pickup which fail as a Jeep and truck, these fail as a phone and tablet.
Lets just say its trash
iPad Pro was the best foldable device
What about the flip-phone
Royole needs to learn from Boeing&#39;s 🇺🇸 big mistake!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=11">0:11</a> - “Weird Flex” you got me there
I feel your disappointment this is a stupid phone
Just like with every other folding phone, this one leaves me asking... &quot;What&#39;s the point?&quot;
The beginning clip 😂
The title of this video didn’t age well.
it is very ugly.
Wow you have  a good mic
No u
When I hear flexpai, I thought  it was flex pie  that flex on other phone.
I like the fold better then this
Kinda makes weird noises when you touch it the wrong way😂😂
Why would you even want a foldable phone , it’s just not necessary 😴
What is the point in a folding phone, just get an ipad 🤦🏽 just unnecessary and easy to break
That rotation problem is the drawback of android because android allows to rotate in 3 sides not the 4th one.
Least did he know...(galaxy z flip/Motorola razr 2019)
&quot;The Last (and First) Folding Phone!&quot; I&#39;m really confused about if something that is the FIRST AND LAST REALLY exists...
And I oop really 😂
it&#39;s too slow and looks very fragile and ugly
Huh! &quot;The last&quot;
Where can I buy it ???
&quot;wierd flex but...ok&quot;
The title of this video was really funny 😂😂
lol😂
MarkASS Brownie
Well this video didn’t age well
What about the flip z
what camera do you use? It looks really clear
I thought it said Royal Flex Pie.
There will always be a bunch of ppl buying this so they can flex on others cuz  its new design and unique, even tho the phone sucks
That fold can last up to 200,000 folds so 7 years of everyday use
him: I need to fold my phone weird flex<br><br>is it no pun intended
Flip phones : Am I a joke to you?
Humans cant be impress yall want to much just fuck off the phone looks sexy as fuck
I like having one side not rotate. It helps when sleeping on the side with landscape mode.
Escobar inc has some innorpropriate advertisement
What’s the point of having a folding phone?
Its the last becus not many want it

“They Last (and First) Folding Phone”<br><br>Razr and Z Flip:
No, it sure wasn&#39;t the last.
Not first or last 1900s
Awwww i want thosee
Imagine playing DS or 3DS  emulator with a folding phone
Ohhhhh-- you&#39;re Mark ass brown Lee
I am looking at this video and I am wondering why I should buy such a phone. This should go only in my backpack hence if I need a bigger screen during my day i will take my tablet. This look really just the idea of creating something just because the business should continue not because there is any meaning of the creation  the company creates.
Why is this phone so thicc
Why does it look like you let a two year old play with this phone at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=461">7:41</a>. Is this thing just showing finger prints that easily or do you need to wash ur hands?
Apple 5 years later : We are releasing the FIRST folding phone
i just realised that this is the same phone that the escobar company used to relaunch it by the name of the escobar fold with just gold plated back and the upper side of the phone when the phone is unflipped.
I&#39;m usually on youtube watching lifestyle videos but every once and awhile I hella binge tech videos. And I&#39;m finally subscribing.
I want it
I dont get why you would want to fold your phone🙌
Guess what young man there was a DS that does that
when you have the first folding phone but a half year later everyone has a better folding phone:<br><br>i have won,<br>But at what cost
The baby mode actually seems like a really good idea
Samsung:Are we a joke to you
Why would anyone want this?
Yes.... the last...
Agreed
The first one is ZTE Axon M
Bottom line: Hot garbage.
Bruhhhh, almost broke it before even it being on u fucking moron
What if it could fold both ways....<br>Now that&#39;s some matrix shit right there.
I feel bad for the guys who made this. They had a brilliant idea, but they didn&#39;t enslave a steve wozniak, so it didn&#39;t work.
My friends: HAHA YOU HAVE A TABLET!<br><br>Me: <b>folds phone</b><br><br><br>Them: (•‿•) (dying on the inside)
These foldphones are literally useless
That is not the first folding phone. Every phone is foldable it is just harder sometimes
Chinese
I agree about the folding
It’s technically a bendable phone
Now we can all <b>Flex</b> our phones wherever we go.
Sneak attack podcast shirt. Nice.
Hey what’s the intro music? Just curious.
Am i the only one TRULLY amazed with this technology. This is so close to those clear phones. Or the ones as thin as paper. This is mindblowing. Of course he needs to criticize this, but 10 years ago this was a dream.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=141">2:21</a> that&#39;s probably not gonna be an issue because NOTHING fits into my tiny fake woman jean pocket anyways 🤷‍♀️
Wasnt the first folding phone from the late 90s
To get a better folding phone buy two of the same phone then put hinges on them
Still too expensive . When the price (if) will reach 500 pounds then people will be really happy and many will have it because it is great . But I am not too sure if they will give that good price ever.but I think screen should be inside so it will open like book and will be more safe from scratches and damages ,unless Samsung doesn&#39;t mind so people will have to buy another one soon
The fold 2 will be released on unpacked 2021 not sooner not later
FlixPie is like that kid in class that  puts his hand up first but gets the answer wrong
Ill pass.  The tech is still shit.  Not durable enough
Yo what about my flip phone that folds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=93">1:33</a> bruh bent the wrong way but it makes better sense folding it inwards
This shit ugly😂💀
Yes
Did you know that the zte Axon M Z999 is the first folding phone.
Every Phone Is Foldable..<br><br>But For Once Only.
What&#39;s with most companies not making their os simplistic I&#39;m fine with Samsung&#39;s os,iOS and Stock Android but the others it takes a long time getting used to tbh
Huawei mate x : hold my phone
I swear you didn’t exist until youtube rewind I’ve never seen you on YouTube before that ever

Ugly.
Jeez you&#39;re wrong
👍👍
My low budget fold phone, a headband and 2 phones.
I want a phone that&#39;s like putty
Show this to the people in the folding galaxy S3 ad all those years ago, that would be the best comparison
I got the perfect folding phone idea. Have it fold in and one side of the back is a workable display so it turns into a smart phone.  Once they learn how to put a screen on the front and a screen on the back these phones won&#39;t be that good.
z flip.
Phones without no headphone Jack suck
That pun at the beginning tho
Umm that&#39;s not the last folding phone <br><br><br><br>There is the galaxy fold<br>And galaxy z flip<br>That&#39;s all I know

“The Last Folding Phone.” Well, this aged poorly.
I really still dont understand why anyone would want a folding phone. Its stupid
I got a z flip ad...

Looking like an accordion isn&#39;t a problem silly...

This phone is hellllll it thickkkkkkkkkk
it&#39;s horrible
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=170">2:50</a> Me too
The DS has been doing this for like 16 years
MARK ASS BROWNIES
This design makes a lot of sense, it makes for a much softer curve which should be easier to do. And you don&#39;t need a third screen when folded. But that diameter is too large. The point is that is should be pretty small, and you fold it out to make it big. This starts big and folds out to huge!<br><br>The baby mode is genius.
The iPad pro is secretly bendable.<br>People: guess ill buy the iPad air 2 then.
where are holographic wearable devices we expected in past.???
10/10 on the flex
“First folding phone” yeah sure the only way this is the first folding phone is if you classify it as the first folding SMARTphone you ignorant fuck
Escobar used this phone to ship the escobar Fold 1 to unboxTherapy and trick him😂lol
It actually has dust covering. Why cant samsung do that
Cant you just download android on that if you can download different OS&#39;s just DONT do IOS
cool review ... thanks
Who is here after the z flip
Your videos seem to be the only one with an aspect ratio that fits my Galaxy S8+&#39;s awkward sized screen.
It&#39;s definetly not the last lol
Is there a Jerryrigeverything video on this?
Marques please review Huawei XS real fast. It is mind blowing

So imagine a case for this phone
Imagine him getting copyright claimed because of the verse <b>&quot;but at what cost&quot;</b>
I think the main goal wasn’t to be good, but just to get$$, like, if new tech ideas are booming, unpopular companies get to profit from this because people are just eager to get new tech no matter if the build sucks or materials used are cheap
Folding phones just aren&#39;t practical
GALXY FOLD IS HERE THE TITLE IS MISLEADING
The motorola razr is very cool... not very powerful but very very cool

Ppl need to quite calling these a phone? It’s basically an android folding tablet that u can make calls on. When I see these devices I don’t get phone.
Personally i think this phone is trash

반응속도 ㄷㄷ 숨넘어갈듯.. 너무 느려..
It looks like a toy and fake
Lol this like pocket while Microsoft fold is like book
Treat the Galaxy fold with care and it will do wonders as a folding phone should. This joke of a flexible phone idk what to call it other that the most confused device in exsistince. Like there is nothing going for this phone that somehow costs $500 more than the fold... To me this phone should called the Royal Joker. It&#39;s most definitely a joke of anything technical. If anything is to be first it&#39;s this their party brand who literally just dumbed random things into a carless package. This is something you would sell to factory works not tech enthusiasts.
I don’t get why folding phones are a thing<br>There’s no point, why would you need a folding phone
It&#39;s not something you&#39;ll pay for.<br>It doesn&#39;t have the technology.
stupid..... weird...
You should do tutorials on the various rugged phones out there. There&#39;s no way that phone still works after a year of regular use, and I&#39;m not a fan of spending $1300 on a phone for a short term experience.
Ok nvm 😑<br>............
That’s probably a wallet or not.....idk
It is not even folding.<br>It is out Bending techology which Samsung invented 7years ago(Youm display). Which exactly 7years behind techology.

Useless technology with not a single feature that is somehow a win in terms of usabillity.
I don&#39;t really get what all the hype was about the folding phones..there is nothing special about it
My last name is Brownlee
I’m pretty sure you’re forgetting about the 90’s and early 2000’s......
Lack of headphone jack? Well, that&#39;s all you had to say, then, lol.

This thing is gonna be re released before I get a girlfriend
Just can’t believe anyone thouht a folding phone was the new wave.
what about watch phones

That’s not the last or the first folding phone. They been around now. It’s called a very large phone called the laptop. Now. It has more features then the phone. It has a keyboard. It’s bigger. And it’s not portable.
price
Pls give him +Respect for ending a video at 9.17 not 10.01...
most phones does not support reverse portrait but support reverse landscape.
Like earbuds.. the first ones had major issues but they have gone leaps and bounds in a short  period  of time....
It is so big for the pocket
It&#39;s cool that we have the tech for folding screens, but it has no function to my on my phone other than as a gimmick, so worthless... please just stop with this nonsense and let me have a user-replaceable battery and a 3.5mm jack.
First foldable phone is made<br><br><br><br><br>Nokia:am i a joke to you

It&#39;s so ugly, even its mother thinks it&#39;s ugly. Also, way to big... and grumpy... and not-the-phone-like phone that it amazes me someone actually thought of this being a new trend for phones and even more so that it became a reality. Never buy this guys and show them all companies how much it costs to realise retarded ideas.
Bruh and I oop I’m done loll
Too bad to be the firsts...<br>Folding out doesn&#39;t make sense! <br>Nice and honest review, as always! :D

I don’t understand why anyone would want a phone like this
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍Nice video support all my fd bro youtube channel
No.. just no.
Galaxy fold is literally on different higher level.
this is not the first one unbox therapy has the first one you are full black man
We can all agree that the iPhone 6/6+ was the first foldable phone

markass
In my opinion, I personally think the folding out phone is better because you can potentially put a two piece screen protector on it and it may reduce the cost because the manufacturer don’t have to add a third screen on the outside like Samsung.
Watching on ZTE Axon M foldable that has been selling since October 2017. Kyocera actually came out with the first foldable phone.  But they both have two screens with a hinge,  not a folding screen. LG also offers a second screen model.
price
That hinge looks like the bendy buses in my country which used to run back in the day.
&quot;Being first doesn&#39;t really matter if it sucks&quot;<br><br>That applies to girlfriends too ;)
I don’t think that the folding phone is the way to advance phone technology bc what’s really the point of a folding phone
How do u get a case for that thing
I don&#39;t like it
if in the old days, foldable phones break quite often if you are a owner, you know. so now you have a flexible screen, foldable design hinges, i doubt there are any improvements being made to mate with these flex screens. besides, kinda silly look if u look at the fold, its like a tacco shell without the stuffing.
I watch your videos just because of how crispy the quality is
pretty cool, looks futuristic, I would buy it for fun but deffo not using it as my main
This phone is rubbish.
I would accidentally snap it by folding the phone the other way...
Thumbs up just for the meme &quot;wierd flex,but OK..&quot;
That phone is sooo ugly
Just wait a couple weeks I am about to release my own folding phone ... its actually 2 iphone X taped along the edge using very high quality electrical tape ... costs a bit more than 2 iphone Xes ... Any takers?
I&#39;m good with one screen. This just looks gimmicky as hell. Even in a perfected version the only thing they&#39;d succeed in is creating a huge failure point in your $1000 device, and what SANE person wants a damn crease in their display? A small crack in the corner of a display would be enough to warrant a screen change for me. And while I&#39;m on this subject, how could a case even be made for this thing without looking like a mid evil torture device?
I can see somebody who just had the Samsung Fold, Folding this the wrong way and breaking it.
A normal phones: 50% chance of breaking<br><br>Samsung galaxy fold: 100% chance of breaking
Please don’t let this be the future of smartphone
i like this one better than the galaxy
A phone for kids
It was literally a weird flex
Who in their right mind would buy this crap!!
The new phone are getting trashier, 2012-2015 was the golden time for phones
Hard gimmick. Hard pass.
Because it folds out it seem reaaally finicky with the touchscreen always on.
So which phone is that? No description? Tnx
And I oop
Why would anybody even want to make such a phone and why would people want it??? This is horrible.
No one reads the instruction- it&#39;s clearly say Do not unfold making pressure on the center of the screen....

How much money was r&amp;d for this phone
I wish you would have put the mic close to the phone so we could hear the noise you speak of when you fold it .<br>Like is the noise really that bad ?
Ok and how comes that no reviewer has reported his / hers is broken yet?
The Flex Pai folding phone tablet is big and ugly. I prefer my regular cell phone and my regular tablet.

I miss the days when a phone was just a phone.
didnt samsung make one and then they tried to peal the platic part of but then the phone broke i dont get it did they steal samsungs idead or <del>not</del>
With a screen setup like this, I can see you push a button and the screen facing outward turns into a screen that captures what the inner screen sees, turning it into a &quot;transparent&quot; phone.
Oppo Reno review it also do a oppo Reno 10x vs p30 pro

Who will buy this shit
Wtf is the point? A screen that changes size? Meh.
To be honest thats a brave and a welcome step!!!<br>Thats how tech grows!! By refining of early crude forms..
That&#39;s a phone? It looks like a tablet
Have y’all ever heard of a thing called a Nintendo DS?

Make a  video about  Samsung dex and linux on dex..
IN one of his videos, MKBHD compares the fingerprint scanner between two different phones. I can&#39;t find the video, please help.
Folding phones remind me of socks with individual toes.<br><br><br>Apparently some people like to buy socks that surround each individual toe uncomfortably, but I have no idea why.
Why are your hands so white
We jumped the shark, I am going back to Beepers
Looks like it&#39;s really easy to touch icons and launch apps accidentally.
Do we really need them?
Lol, I remember a short few months ago people criticizing samsung folding like a book. Where are you now ?!

Marques with the dead memes
There is going to be a day where he runs out of cool, techy intro songs.
when it&#39;s folded it reminds me of the old Samsung Galaxy edge phones
I thought that was a wallet
Foldable phones are a bad idea. Nothing is that durable.
Crap review
I would like to see a review over time.
it always boggles my mind when these Chinese companies have enough resources to R&amp;D a state of the art technology like a folding phone and yet fail to hire someone who speaks fluent English.
No. Two metal phones with glass screens. Separated by metal in the center and closes completely flat.
What is the name of that xiaomi device
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=437">7:17</a> your information is already sent to &quot;who knows where&quot;, no matter which OS you use.
It&#39;s a foldable tablet.
Galaxy phone is trash stop renting phones
I like the shortcuts on the screen side but the four screens I don’t see it and the split I don’t see it .  Awhen  you still flip back you can still display this phone on the other side
How did you get the American apps on the Chinese version talking about Google and Google friends is it possible to get on Royal flex
Why do you open yours all the way like that I don’t open mines that wide
That’s so cool looking though
Why not get rid of the “3rd screen” and add a specific folding mechanism without the chance of a screen cracking because of the fold.<br>Edit: that would also get rid of the awkward fold that makes it harder to fit in a pocket.
yay mark ass brownie
Wait, no Google Play Services?!
The folding around of the Portrait view phone screens, is less interesting than the folding out of the phone screen to make a tablet size screen which is I believe the object of the mission. And if my Lenovo yoga 14 inch 360° hinge laptop had telephony, I wouldn&#39;t need a phone or a tablet! If it were not for corporate greed itself, windows would have built telephony into their operating system along time ago, and we would just be carrrying around foldable laptops with touch screens, and able to call our friends without needing a mobile phone. Mobile operating system&#39;s are half assed anyway, so our desktop environment has and always will be the best. It&#39;s just a shame they refuse to add telephony to the functionality of the operating system
Literally any phone from 2006:We&#39;re thicc<br>Royale: Hold my beer
&#39;You&#39;re 1st. but at what cost&#39;....classic..😂
Can I scare my friends if they don&#39;t know what it is?
Hello,how I wish I have one of this foldable phones

Mark-ass Brownie

No. No. Nope. I am getting the Note 10 instead. No folding phone for me.

This phone is ugly
Fucking suck
Folding both ways is the future
I like the custom HTC Vive with an audio strap in the background!
That is bigger than a phone but smaller than an ipad
click bait!
Mark ass brownie
Why that 3rd screen portion is not poping out while defolding it
literally pice of crab

Remember when cell phones were portable?
C.O.M.P.L.I.C.A.T.E.D phone.

Mark ass brownlee
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ뭐임
Will it cost 1000.00 or more than 1000.00
“Being first doesn’t really matter if it sucks...” this is Apple’s entire philosophy.
Design gone terribly wrong.
His face unfolding the phone was the best :-D
Is that a 4DS?
I can barely wait to see the Motorola Razr reincarnation.  I always loved the clamshell folding phones.  They were very efficient, durable, and I loved trying to close it just the way you demonstrated at the end.  <br><br><br>Also, it was a very cool way to show your annoyance at the conversation you just abruptly ended when closing the phone, especially when paired with some eye rolling and calling the person an idiot.
Marques: *snaps<br>Half of all tech products become matte black<br>Marques: Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Drop it and break everything....
So umm how much is the phone case
What is the point in a folding phone.
Бабабаба пэпэпэпэпэ пыкпыкпык
Yes! The chinese version of the galaxy fold!
I&#39;ll wait till the first liquid phone comes out.
Kaam payena buari, padako kondo konai.
You&#39;re wrong.  The flip phone came out years ago.  You are too young to remember it.  You probably don&#39;t remember bag phones either. Get real.
Bullshit
whats the benefit of the folding? I dont get it - looks like a complete fail
I think folding out will help with the development of protective foldable screen protectors and even foldable gorilla glass
Baby mode is the only thing they got right.
Why would I want my phone to fold in the first place?  This is just a useless, costly and impractical gadget.  Fire somebody for the idea and fire someone else for moving forward and wasting company money and resources on this dumb idea.
Unboxing of asus ROG
Instead of creating a retarded phone, why not invest on inventing shatterproof glass for a phone?
I&#39;d be satisfied by folding it the other way.
Lmao cool
The 5k dislikes are moms that want to make there babies instagram famous
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROkXM3csNWY&amp;t=170">2:50</a> &quot;it kinda makes noises when you touch it the wrong way&quot; woah there buddy calm down we are trying to be pg lmao
Why are people so obsessed with a folding phone? What functionality does it provide?
It’s so ugly. I won’t buy it.
stupid
very uncomfortable to use
anyone else think he was kind of negative but i get why i jus thought he could have looked at positive perspectives x that’s just my opinion
meh, I don&#39;t want a folding phone
Take a what of yourself?  Selfie? Surely, you mean, take a picture of yourself. Anybody who seriously uses that stupid term deserves a dislike from me.

Why do people need folding phones? Maybe it’s just me but the idea is dumb.
