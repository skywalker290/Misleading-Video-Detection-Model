Ese combate lo ganó romero
From here izzy hatres begon
Izzy ran for 5 rounds and won
izzy is right
I&#39;d love to see Alex Pereira do this type of interview maybe one day hahahaha
So why didn’t Yoel walk him down lol how can he blame Izzy
“You wantA seeYa running , go see A UsiainBOLT”😂😂😂
izzy vs yoel&#39;s leg😆
adesanya..the biggest Pussy.. hahaha.. Running Champion 😅😅
Lmao you wanna see running go see us Ian bolt this is a fight!
Running champ..what a shame
Israel Adesanya is so petty😂
Yoel he was running but you were standing half the fight trying to counter and not attack.<br>Also, if he was running 🏃‍♀️ this is ufc not boxing make him fight Yoel. You were the problem this fight not him.🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿
He said champions dont run 😂 basically
Yoel sounding like tony montana
😅😅😅😂😂
The only question mark in his career was Joel he needs to run that back, because he clearly showed how scare he was
Adesanya fans are more delusional than Connor fans hahahaha izzy literally ran away every hard exchange 🤣 😂 😅  he said he was gonna be the first one to shut down romero. He kicked legs and stayed the fk back hahaha
Your full of shit bro lol romero fkd u
Yoel is the only man to make Izzy turn around an full on run nawab from him the entire fight, Izzy was so scared he literally ran away and just threw leg kicks
The people pay hahaha
😂 nanalo pa yung takbo ng takbo 😅
Why didn’t Yoel go after Israel and fight if he wanted that? To complain is ridiculous. It takes two
Yoel tore him a new one, Adesanya thought being disrespectful is fine, Yoel told him there&#39;s levels to this.
In my book, romero.
Yoel got the hypocrite belt here though so no losers today
God I miss Yoel
Romero wins this fight i very clear he won 1,2,5
The people want a bull fight. That&#39;s a what the people wanna see here. Y&#39;all wanna see running y&#39;all go see Usain bolt 😂😂 Romero is a danger to your health and your language but you heard him tho 💯
na fuck that - you wanna take the belt - you gotta take it. Yoel tried to prove a point and failed miserably. Adesanya is defensive fighter, everyone knows this.
It was Yoel’s fault for not challenging Izzy
After this fight dana cut romero immediately
Israel wouldn&#39;t last in bare knuckles
As old as he is as many fights and headshots in his life and after 5 rounds 100 push ups and speaking his second language i was able to distinguish 90% of what he said. I get the impression from him that he is super intelligent and his reaction time was impeccable this fight
Yoel won 1/2/3
He was right it’s a bloodsport not track and field.
For real that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about Yoel Remero tell him that&#39;s right booyyy people pay paper view for a fight not see people run away like Usain bolt that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna start saying now lol that&#39;s right
Grande Yoel 💪
THE PEOPLE PAY
sorry but Romero is right....Izzy was scared to engage all night ...to me Romero never ran once...izzy was tripping over himself running away so for him to say Yoel was running is just pure projection lmfao
yoel was the one stalling it’s the guy with the reach disadvantage that’s supposed to close that range
Jjjjjj Haci fue campeón no no coloco nada solo patada al mismo punto con ese mastodonte no pelea mala para la bestia
Broo his translator is the biggest piece of shit
I think yoels wins 100% this fight
I don&#39;t even know what he&#39;s trying to say 🤣🤨
Yoel was so angry 🤣 I feel so sad for him 🤣 Dancing all the round 🤣🤣🤣
Take this video out. It not representing the sport!
when not loosing is a win
i love Joe but ...
i think Yoel got cheated by the UFC MANY TIMES!!
The best interview in the history of ufc. That is my Petrie! 😂
Man, Yoel&#39;s interview was more entertaining then the fight itself
Man, if Yoel won this fight the world would be a better place.
Imo Yoel won this fight
I know people what to see a war but fighters still need to feed their families and make a living if they can fight a safe fight and win they will do so .
Look EZYs face lol🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=40">0:40</a> I am dying hahhhahahah
Shoutout Yoel man !
Go to see Usain Bolt If you want to see running 😂😂🤣
Dont blam romero <br>If you great fighter then ,<br>Broke her difence,and<br>Win..<br>This match is 50=50
Romero won that fight for me<br><br>This guy was robbed the most by the ufc<br>He beat Whittaker for me.<br>He beat Costa for me<br>He beat adesanya for me<br>All the decision losses are debatable a real gladiator..... A real man
See ? The big mouth he has ? He can’t stand and fight like most do,he keeps running like a girl ! Costa vs romero that was a fight ! Adesaya someone will shut you up one day ! Big BOOOOOO FROM THE AUDIENCE!!!!
His leg 🤣🤣🤣he frustrated izzy
Everybody n the crowd said what he say
Izzy tan the whole fight
Usain Bolt wants to race u
Yea yoel was right...   he was a track star in this match ... lol running hiding... scared just wanted a decision knowing it would be in his favor smh
The boos speak for itself. Bad champion.
Even the gladiator arenas are big to give the participants room to move around. I don&#39;t understand why yoel have to complained.  He came with a game plan, izzy came with his own game plan. Yoel is the one that started the fight as if it was a joke. Izzy took out his legs to give him something to think about after the fight for not being serious and setting traps that didn&#39;t work. Izzy&#39;s team new exactly what Yoel romero&#39;s team game plan was and izzy beat yoel clean. Go izzy.
Romero 1/3/5
Keep running bro trash
well Adesanya fight smart and dont wanna rush against this guy becauze romero is much bigger and powerful but he pick him in a part and thats it so romero cant stay that Adesanya run because he just try to avoid the punches and hit romero with leg kicks and other punches if romero was good he would engage and try to finish the fight but he didnt so he lost at then end.. so u have to play smart to win sometimes and in my opinion Adesanya did good job in fact that this guy is much bigger and both of them he little distance betweeen and slow going forward so he cant say that adesanya did that or that when he did same thing and just staying there doing not so much.. adesanya throw many kicks and won the fight !
Izzy is cringe af bro
WHY RUN IF YOU ARE THE BEST?
Still better than Rose🌹 vs Esparaza
Fuck izzy, glad he fell off after this, rightfully so. boring cringe fighter and cares about himself more than the sport
He sounds like Bane from Batman. But Puerto Rico version
he is wrong af, look in the mirror mr romero, you are describing your actual failure as the CHALLENGER role.. y would the champ go to u..? huhuhuhuhu
Terrible interview by yoel
Yoel didn&#39;t do anything and then has a go during the interview
UFC champs defend belts with leg kicks. Telling.
😂😂Yoel was dreaming. No way he won the fight. And he didn&#39;t really try to engage. Any proper ufc fight analyst knows this
I understand him n respect him 😂but his English the way he talks makes we wanna cry and can&#39;t stop laughing at the same time 😂😂
He sounds like bane
Sore loser, once you step inside the octagon everything is allowed and what does it say about your form when you can&#39;t catch a &quot;runner&quot; xD
This fight for relaxing and insomnia you will sleep calmly no action don&#39;t worry
My name is fezi. I am a fat crap!
Romero&#39;s right
Izzy is the most boring champion
Fake ass champ, that&#39;s why he went up and got destroyed
That made no sense.. if you could take his shot..than why would you not have stand and bang not kick his leg to take the lead foot out🤷🏻‍♂️😭
Honestly Izzy won I guess idk that was the worst fights I’ve ever paid for. Lol commenting 2 years later but damn that was trash 🗑. Izzy was trash this fight….   booooo
Izzy  ran like a puss yoel  is right
yoel literally sounds like donald duck
Izzy knows deep down inside he lost that fight...
Why is Yoel acting like he didnt contribute to it being a shit fight ?
100% agree with Yoel
&quot;Did what I had to do&quot; = run💀
Yoel will always be the undefeated undisputed champion
Isreal is fake news, yoel should of beet  50 shades of shit out of him, run like bolt i will always back the soldier of God. It really is his victory
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=37">0:37</a> lmao Yoel is so pissed he had to sneak that one in
I don&#39;t understand Yoel&#39;s logic. He has what you want, go take it. Too bad he&#39;ll probably never get a title shot again.
How can someone hate this man 😂
Great respect to Romero for fighting 2 tough matches in one night, one against Izzy and a devastating one against English language...
2 years ago! Time flies man
Good times ✌
Israel Adesanya is the new Floyd &#39;Chicken&#39; Mayweather of the UFC
I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that they booed izzy but cheered for Yoel after the fight lmao makes 0 sense ESPECIALLY given the fact that Yoel should be going out there to TAKE the belt from the champion
Izzy so wack lol. &quot;I did what I had to do, LoOk aT HiS LeGs&quot;. It&#39;s likes he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else lol
Yoel almost knocked out Rogan with this right hand 💀💀💀
Yoel..dangerous man
Fucked his leg up he says 😂😂 good for you bro that’s not a fight pussyhole
Ridiculous
Aí está uma luta comprada kkkkk
Yoel sounds like bane😂😂😂😂
Izzy was so scared his gyno started running out of his body
I love that Joe respects both fighters and he doesn’t try to disrespect them. Much respect to Joe for that. Yoel One of my favorite fighters and so is Israel. In my book I think they both are winners but yeah the running around nonsense if a fighter wants to square up with you is not fun to watch.
I love him lol
Stick to wrestling u fool
Dude is huge Lmaoo cmon you gotta adjust to your opponent
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=311">5:11</a> the translator is like &#39;&#39;well, there goes my gig... this motherfucker trying so hard to speak English&#39;&#39;🤣
Say what you will about Yoel, but he was a G for this interview.
This is very smart move israel played...
Go see boallttttt
israel got countered in his first attempt to run in on yoel and was scared after that
The legs don’t lie...😂😂😂
Romero loss lol
If you wanna see running go see usain bolt
Yoel Romero :  Talking for 2 minutes long to say that the fight was shameful and so boring<br>Joe Rogan : &quot;Thank you for an other excellent fight&quot;
They did him dirty.
English (UK)<br>English (US)<br>English (Romero)
Nah yoel won. He tried to have style in the beginning that wasn&#39;t well received. But everyone sees he was head hunting that little boy.
Israel getting rude with Joe Rogan
And stillll the middleweight &#39;fastest running&#39; championnnnn ....the last speed run bender
If you ask me Yoel was just mad cause  he got his legs kicked black and blue bruise color and lost fair and square . Dude was limping around the otagon
People cheering on Romero while the dude literally did nothing lmao
“After that, I knew I could take his best shot” <br><br>Translation : “after that; I knew I couldn’t risk getting hit again”
Yoel should stop takin stuff he is never Natural
Making fun of a man who fights for living for the way he talks fuck yall step in the cage with him
Yoel is a big hypocrite for this. I mean his attitude at the end is total BS. HE&#39;S the challenger... HE goes forward! He has to GO GET the belt. Izzy has nothing to prove. Romero is Persia and Izzy is Sparta. Romero is the one saying &quot;lay down your weapons&quot; (or &quot;give me that belt&quot;) and Izzy is the one saying &quot;come and get them (it)&quot;. You don&#39;t invade a foreign country and then sit on your ass and wait for THEM to attack. WTF
That boo<br>Says it all<br><br>Congrats Romeo the People&#39;s Champ!
The crowds reaction says it all
Am I the only one that actually liked the fight. Everything except the stupid crowd booing
I understand half what Romero said
If he is running then he should have just chased him the first place untill he catches him. But didnt coz he is also afraid to get countered. That over hand is a bomb. Why would you try to catch it ? If you know you cant handle it.
Israel still talks trash while he was running like 🐱s in arena and says he a champion<br>He a champion in running inside the arena like scared 🐱
everybody in the comments think yoel is a clown because of his english...
After reading the comments section I realised one thing most people watch UFC with the mindset of a WWE fan lol real fighting is unpredictable and not how u pictured it to be...izzy literally won the fight what more can you ask for, I bet these are the same people who go around commenting casual on everybody who&#39;s got a different opinion than theirs🤦‍♂️
Yo soy Español y entendí mucho mejor el inglés de Yoel que el inglés de Adesanya !  ( Si pones los subtítulos (en inglés)  automáticos de you tube , es un espectáculo lo que pone cuándo habla Romero)
Da peepole pae da paepervue 2 si us fighh, <br>Yoel the people’s champ, one of those fighters, win or lose, love to see him live and well 💪🏾
Am I the only one who saw Adesanya being shattered,more than a couple of times during this FIGHT ? <br><br>Also,am I the only one who thinks that if this fight would have been a classic 1v1, Romero COULD have eaten him alive easily ? <br><br>(IF HE COULD CATCH HIM OFC)
Adesanya is so full of himself and thinks he is the best when he kept running lol
Izzy  called down the THUNDER, and when the LIGHTNING start striking. He ran for the hills.
Adesanya is the cringiest guy ever !
im happy for this fight but not the results. at least we all knew that yoel won the fight and izy couldn’t beat him
Fake fights in UFC! Dana quit faking! Otherwise you are turning UFC into Jake Paul bs
Yoel acted like he was innocent.. dude you just stood there not even trying to engage a fight, you were also the reason this was bad fight
It’s hit and miss with the UFC PPV. I’d still like to see them go at it again.
Close your eyes and Yoel sounds like bane 😂
The people pe-a-ay
counter striker vs counter striker<br><br>worst match up UFC history
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=291">4:51</a><br>aeh
Izzy so cringe 🤢🤢🤢
The fight wasn&#39;t that bad tbh. It lacked action but had some good moments. Fans just set a high standard after seeing Weili vs JJ. I mean, Yoel did better than Costa and Vettori.
Shut up yoel
Romero great fighter
Thatsawhatthepeoplewanttoseehere
Thatsawhatthepeoplewanttoseehere
Adesayana vs Romero 2?
Izrael lost and was running like a bitch
“I can take his best shot” you just ran away after that😂
You izzy run away, lol,  before fight i will finish Him, after fight i do what i need to win
romero said he just run and run that not run stupid thats Footwork 🖕  but why you just doing dancing in octagon not attack 🖕🖕🖕
&quot;I low you mike&quot;
When the winner has to point out that he fucked up his opponent’s leg u know it’s a shitty fight.
Adensanya literally ran away at one point
I was hoping to touch em more, he didn’t wanna dance😏 fuck outta here
no wonder u didn&#39;t see a real fight ....one of the fighters was drunk....u can tell when started talking 🤣🤣🤣
Yoel ain&#39;t limping 😂. He made of steel
Yoel won 48-47
Guys. Izzy&#39;s whole game plan is to fight from the outside and pick people apart. To get mad at yoel for something izzy does all the time requires mental backflips. Yoel literally stood there and it exposed izzy for who he is. A cautious fighter who will never come in against guys who can sleep him
Run and run that was a Marathon
Joe: &quot;Thank you for another excellent fight.&quot;<br>Everyone Else: &quot;...&quot;
The boos said it all😁
He ran like a beahtch...he ain&#39;t no champion ✌
That was good running. Awesome fighter though
Why is Yoel acting like he did fucking anything this fight?
Izzy is lame as fuck
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=312">5:12</a> bro even his translator was trying to keep from laughing 😂😂
Imitation is the best form of flattery. Adesanya&#39;s &quot;costa see you soon boi&quot; says it all.
I don’t understand how people can be mad at adesanya Yoel turtled up and expected him to run into a trap he didn’t fall for it what’s the problem 🧍🏽
Yoel Romero, Nate Díaz and Chael Sonnen on the commentary table please
Rogan was biting the shit outta his gum to not burst out laughing 😐
Still champion bull shit
Not fair. Romero deserved
Why does this man sounds exactly Conor in Assassin’s Creed III
Adesanya fight like a pussy. Run, run and run
Yeah Israel just ran away. He knew he would lose. Yoel had this one.
If Romero wanted to fight, then why the fuck didn&#39;t he fight? Why didn&#39;t he attack? Why did he loss?
I know both Spanish and English!! And I still don&#39;t understand his Spanish as well! 😆😆
Romero won this fight!
Yoel deserved the win
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=265">4:25</a> joe looks so confused and trying to understand yoel 😂
Who can boo adesanya
Yoel romero said “the people wanna see a fight” as he just stood there and did nothing for 5 rounds
Even tho he cannot speak English so well, at least he can communicate in USA by speaking English, I wonder how many that are talking crap, can go to cuba and speak Spanish. Smh
Ngl, I actually really enjoyed this fight. It felt like a silent psychological fight between the two. You know how Adesanya plays, and when he pulls the trigger during the earlier rounds, Romero has a gameplan with this and he instinctively counter punches. And because of that Adesanya had to respect him. And during the fight Romero keeps waiting, only to charge with takedowns or strikes once in a while. But throughout the fight Adesanya picks his leg off like poison which Romero doesn&#39;t adapt to and it pays off with the W at the end. Romero expecting a mortal kombat fight with adesanya, but adesanya has been slowly eating him already.
Paber Biew
Yoel is the people’s champ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=291">4:51</a> aggkk
Yoel: 😭😭
i ain’t gonna lie i’m a big fan of adesanya but idk man 😂 they gotta fight again
great card but these fans are stupid as fuck. even the ones at home. if you think izzy is in the wrong more than Romero than your just as stupid as he is with all that CTE. he can’t say real fight and then not engage. shelled up into a ball like a bitch.
Rogan was about to faint trying to understand Romero 😂
It just makes me smile hearing everyone boo Adesanya and cheer Romero after Jan kicked Adesanya’s ass
Yoel<br>Won that fight
I don&#39;t laugh at people,but I had to laugh this🤣it&#39;s the Engilsh for me!🤣🤣 <br>This fight was just like Romero&#39;s english<br>When I watched the fight all I got was sleep🥱🥱one of them was dancing and one started running🤦‍♀️🕺🏃whatever🥰team Izzy🇳🇬🇳🇬🏅
Love Romero
No offense but I did not understand a fooking word Yoel said 🤣
Lizzy is such a punk.. &quot;look at his leg..&quot; bro look at your FACE. Then he wants to talk about inactivity, but after mero landed, he ran away from him the rest of fight. There were times where you could visibly tell he was scared of mero. All that talk before the fight and the only thing you can say is &quot;leg at his leg&quot;.. So happy Jan was able to dominate and slightly humble this arrogant pos, even though he says he&#39;s still undefeated LoL how does someone who is said to be &quot;the best striker in the UFC&quot; get outclassed in striking from some with a reach disadvantage?? Lizzy is so overated, can&#39;t wait til someone puts his to sleep and he can&#39;t make excuses.. Lizzy gonna be Rhonda 2.0 😂😂
Go see Usain Bolt
Whats with the fake cheering everyone was booing i remember
Oh heck yeah
Came back to this fight and Romero still won this fight
A lot of respect to this man 💪💪💪💪💪<br>See you soon yoel vs adesanya 2
Yoel was robbed of this championship..
Yoel the only guy you can honestly say hasn’t lost his last fight each one you can give him it smh yoel still a legend he got a silver medal his legacy lives on
Mike I loooove you, see you soooon
Lost most respect for Yoel after this, he didn’t engage anymore than Israel and goes on to blame the whole thing on the latter. So much for sportsmanship.
1,2,5 - Romero
Fake Champion
I used to speak like Romero in my English class exposition haha
Bien Adesanya
Yoel won actually...
&quot;The realli addrelina, Adrenalín&quot;
Watch a non championship fight once in the UFC, the fighter dominated the other fighter for two rounds he knocked him to the ground twice but after that he stayed away and waited for the cards maybe he thought he would win because he knocked down his opponent twice and any other than that it was pretty even but his opponent won and the judges said it was due to octagon control. He kept running just like Izzy did weaving out of harms way while his opponent always charges and sinks a punch or two from time to time, if that guy won even after gotten knocked to the ground twice i&#39;d call this fight a robbery.
Champion lost he was running all the way like a goose he lost!!!!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=291">4:51</a>  ah
Both to blame for that fight being the most boring fight in history I don’t get why people still blame Yoel adesanya did nothing and once he got caught he did even less
The running champion😂
Romero 💪🏿
Who is here after Izzy went Sage mode agianst Costa
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=267">4:27</a> The face Joe Rogan has, trying to make sense of what Yoel is saying is priceless😅😅
Adesanya is the champ, he has the belt so Romero should’ve took the fight to him or Izzy would’ve picked him apart from the outside the entire fight which he did. Idk why everyone blames adesanya
Jack Paul was true <br>Dana White is damn fucking pussy 🥴🥴 he don&#39;t deserve the titles to be honest 🥴🥴🖕
Israel did not fight like a champion.
skip to Romero&#39;s speech, it&#39;s very funny)) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=224">https://youtu.be/0atug3XxODY?t=224</a>
Romero won that’s fight
yoel is the winner ...
I could be wrong bc I&#39;m not an avid ufc follower, but it seems like all the israel fights never go to the ground. Can nobody take him down to wrestle and grapple? <br>Is he that good at avoiding it? <br>Maybe they have, I just don&#39;t remember seeing it happen.
Yoel vs transISRAELgender??? <br><br>Fighter vs Runner???
You Didn’t won this fight my boy fuck Outta here !!!! All the running please
Joe consentrating so hard while listening to Yoel
Yoel could have done better sure but Izzy did run simple.
Joe looking at Romero trying his hardest to understand what he sayin 😂
Yoel is a loser🤦‍♂️
Look legs hahaha łeb dancing run star
Adesanya run Forest run Forest hahaha
lol if yoel was really that great of a brawler and a powerhouse as he thinks himself is than y didnt he chase iggy down and beats the shit out of him instead of waiting for a big counter shots after performing one successfully and why did he complains about iggy running away as if they were fighting on an infinite open stage lol seriously and he thinks hes a peoples champ lol really instead he proved to be a retarted champ for retarted fans someone with power but no brain someone who got outplayed and bitched about it for not playing his way as if that was the only rule also i know people will say iggy said this and that during the beef leading to the fight n im not saying u guys are wrong he didnt met with the standards he set during the beef but thats nothing to be taken seriously but instead i admire him for not letting his ego get in the way showing how smart and a controller of a fight he is for embracing his strenght and his flaws during a fight after  trying that hard punch showing he actually tried at first and realising it that first that that might be the wrong move showing hes a genious and doesnt underestimate his opponents and that is way better than the standards yoel was trying to portray by bitching about it 😂😂😂 omg
Adesanya is a piece of shit
Izzy: If you stay around til you&#39;re 50, I&#39;ll see you soon boy<br>Yoel: I&#39;ll see you soon!<br><br>Dana: I&#39;m bout to end this man&#39;s whole career
Yoel is OG as always
3 clear hit on Izzy face hahhaa come on...
Stfu Romero, this is exactly what I wanted to see. People with brains, who want to win, who win. Nobody wants to see sore loosers
Fight was boring and thats true! But It was not a bad fight whatsoever. This is fighting not a clash guys. They had their strengths and Izzy used his better. Ofc you are not going to get into trades in close range with Romero. Why would you? Izzy adapted to fight after first round and did what he had to do to win it. It is not a beating up contest. Romero is talking like he forced any situation on Izzy or tried to force any sort of close encounters. Nope he tried couple of times and he fucked up because Izzy is slippery. After not being able to dominate the fight with his style and getting ripped apart slowly, he is frustrated. He knows that he fucked up and he knows that Izzy controlled the pace and distance of the fight. And after that fuck up he is playing to the crowd and trying to gain the favour of the crowd by complaining. He says &quot;This is not how champions fight.&quot; you do not get to describe how a champion should fight, thats the job of the &quot;Champion&quot;. The champ fights the way he wants to fight and thats why he is the champ and you are not.
The most boring champion 🥱🥱🥱
Lol izzy kick yu like worlcup bruh you lost shutup
Romero clearly won but anyways...
Romero mereceu a vitória não tirando os méritos do adesanya vai entender esse UFC
I think romero win this fight
Romero is better..
Is it bad that I understood Yoel perfectly
Give me the fuckin boy
Yeal champion
Really just a clash of personalities, Yoel comes to fight, and Israel comes to win.
Yoel Romero  has won I think sory poor umpayere
I was just waiting for Yoel to jab Joe&#39;s chin at the end
It’s not Adesanya’s fault the fight was boring. He just had to maintain his belt. It was up to the contender to march forward and win it.
Normal people level in English :b2<br>Yoel : e1
Izu, Jan is coming for you 💪👊🇵🇱😉
Much respect to Yoel
Romero blaming Israel is stupid lol Romero<br>Didnt do shit
Damn right he was fighting a running guy
La candela 😂
Yoel Romero can’t expect a fighter to come towards him when they know his rushing counter. Just like how he didn’t wanna go towards Izzy knowing his precision and counter striking is dangerous.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=246">4:06</a> <br><br>All things that allow Joe Rogan to comprehend what he hears audibly transcends from his body.
i have a one questooon.....i have a one questooon..... who is here from the people in 2021 :))
By the this is also one tactic he wanna win and he won good night
Yoel has to be the most dumb talented fighter in the history of the ufc. His last title shot and he did nothing.
Isreal didn&#39;t fight like a champion
Who also still feel for yoel??
why is the upper left leg swollen?  What did he put in our pants?
Izzy is so damn smart , i love it, people don’t seem to understand how fighting is.
Adesa just run buhhhhhh
The real win is romero
adesanya ..very nice running....bad fight fir you!
Romero... روميرو
what a cook? adesanya 18-1
He didn’t win though
The people pay e ei
Hi! I am Adesanya🏃💨💨💨💨💨💨💨
Isreal just run not fight loses
QuEsChIoN Queschion Queschion
Romero top 👏🏽👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
What the heck??? What happened  Romero&#39;s voice???
How the fuck Yoel convinced morons that he won is beyond me. Yoel stood there for 5 rounds, too scared to get countered by Izzy and yet he blamed the fight being boring on Izzy. A lot of mma fans are complete idiots.
If that first shot was on the chin it’d be over
Livin&#39; la vida costa😂😂
Wow<br>Gynosanya.
Adesanya is a great fighter but is really hard to like due to his personality. Just goes out of his way to be a prick.
This is the best octagon interview off all time by far 😂!!!!
Dark Souls 3 PVP
Lol the crowd IQ = -9000<br><br>They cheer for Yoel, and boo Izzy. Yoel did nothing in that fight. Izzy was smart, he didn&#39;t run. He evaded and picked Romero apart like a tangerine. If Romero was a bit more aggressive he would have lost badly. Izzy is smart and didn&#39;t put himself in jeopardy unnecessarily. Look at the rest of his fights, all exciting. Both fighters are counterstrikers, but Izzy is more aggressive than Romero in his fights. Romero is much more laid back. Both are counterstrikers for the most part and that&#39;s why it was a stale fight. These fans, filthy casuals...
Adesanya the Road Running 😂
&quot;He is ruining and  ruining and ruining &quot;....
Can you believe this was the last fight of Yoel fkn Romero in the ufc! :&#39;3
Romero knew they were gonna cut him. Plus going 3 wars, 2 with Wittaker and Costa and still losing to a decision will deff make you think the odds are against you to take the belt.
he ran like a gazelle but the lion didn&#39;t hunt him. And it was the lions job to win the fight and get the belt, izzy was just defending what he already had. Sounds like the people booing should&#39;ve gone out to the parking lot and watched a street fight instead.
I hate when dopes get mad when they don’t have the skill to touch a guy and call him a coward for being smart and keeping distance.
La Candela !!!!!!
Most of you are missing the point. The idea is survival; winning! The real fight isn’t just kicking and punching, trust me. Take it from a martial artist and a competitor, there is more mental stuff to a good fight than the physical brawl.<br>Izzy did what he had to do... and he won! Romero can’t expect Izzy to make him comfortable, no. Not if Izzy truly wants to win. If you’ve seen Izzy’s past fights, even the next one against Costa, you’d know he is a fighter and of physicality is what is demanded, he has an abundance of it.
I think Israel did what he had to do. Yoel’s fights are kinda weird. Watch Israel in his other fights and you can see how he takes his opportunities very skillfully. Being careful isn’t necessarily bad. Maybe less entertaining, but I still enjoyed the fight.
Da people pa pe pew
Isreal Fight IQ is over 300
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVYCnQcwag4">https://youtu.be/jVYCnQcwag4</a><br><br>Some comedy with FACTS
What’s Yoel blaming it on ia for?  They were both as bad as each other.  The only ufc event I’ve ever been at.  I want my money back!!!
TODOS LOS QUE DICEN QUE ROMERO GANO ESTA PELEA NO TIENEN NI IDEA. EN QUE HA GANADO  EXSACATAMENTE? SOBRE TODO EL COMIENZO DEL PRIMER ROUND LO QUE HIZO ES ES OTRO NIVEL DE TONTERIA, POR LO MENOS DISIMULA UN POCO HAZ QUE VENGA  A TI ,PERO QUEDARTE TOTALMENTE QUIETO? NADIE ES TAN TONTO. SI LE HUBIERAN DADO ESTA PELEA ME SCD . PATETICO.
romero win . ufc is fakev
Damn tony montana is an ufc fighter
G. O. A. T (soldier of God)
YOEL ROMERO WON THIS FIGHT, IZZY HAD NO TAKE DOWNS AND LOOKED SCARED THE WHOLE DAMN FIGHT. NO CONTROL OF THE OCTAGON AND KEPT RUNNING 😂💯
You wanna see Ronen go see usaim bolt. Well said 😂
This fucking guy lost and still a champ?? Exactly Mayweather-Castillo I. EXACTLY. Wow...fucking UFC is rigged
Yoel is my favorite fighter. He&#39;s right. People paid to see a fight. You want to see running, watch Usain Bolt.
la ufc no te merecia yoel, las ultimas peleas te las robaron a luz del dia con 200000 personas y sin arma... No te merecia !! , pero nos diste muy buenos espectaculos !
I don&#39;t know what Yoel Romero said lol
However you saw the decision - it was a strange fight.
The last time we saw Romero fight in the UFC. We had no idea of this before the last week.
Most boring fighter ever isreal Adesanya
In UFC if you dont die againt Yoel you win by decision.
Who’s here after Yoel was released
Yoel lost n still got the crowd to cheer
Joe rogan staring yoel down trying to understand what the fuck is he saying
the people pay for pepper view!!!
I  don´t understand how adesanya won. Yoel landed more punches and significant punches. Robbed big time!
Adesanya is a pro dodgeball athlete.
Izzy played smart after eating that punch in the first round. If he can eat those and pick apart his opponent little by little, even the biggest guy would fall. Just like mayweather vs Pacquiao, everyone thought pacquiao won but mayweather had the better “stats”
Yoel talked a lot about wanting to give the fans a real fight but also stood like a statue in the beginning
Yoel you’re the best there is no doubt. Adsanye he is the biggest runner in ufc. Polo costa and you had hell of the fight. You make me laugh 😂 when you said you wanna run 🏃‍♀️ go for hussen bolt. Mate I’m still laughing
Poor guy. That was his &#39;&#39;bictory&#39;&#39; :D
Go watch Fluffy stand up about how a Spanish fighter talks and then when he tries to talk English. It’s so perfect for this man. I think yolo won
Adesanya could have been more humble and realistic. The fight was terrible.
Joe - An odd fight<br>Izzy - A hard fight 😂😂😂😂
Look at Adesanyas face. He know He lost the Fight. UFC need a underated Champion.
Asadena was back kicking Yoels legs. just like Jon Jones does in his fights. Quinton Jackson said that really misses peoples leg up because it can end careers.
1st wants to fight 2nd wants to run they don&#39;t match ) joke of a fight
The last UFC event to include the crowd before the coronavirus
People was really mad at Israel for this fight but love watching Floyd Mayweather....
Romero was better
Hahhhahaha adesanya win omg fucking ufc
I think his English is great--totally understood him.  What a beast.  Those Cuban vitamins do a body good I see :-)
the judge that gave 46-49 scores is not doing his job
Yoel fucking buff the homie can&#39;t even turn his neck, moves his whole body🤣
OCEANS ELEVEN
&quot;de pipopepapipopu&quot; - yoel romero
Adesanya you cannot even win in dancing with Romero...his older but stronger than you...that’s a rubout...Romero was right the viewers deserve a better fight from Adesanya ...Adesanya runs like a chicken...big mouth but can not even deliver a good fight with Romero...Don’t worry Romero it’s  very clear that you won the fight 👏👏👏
That’s BS Adesanya...you know it yourself that the 12 yr. old Romero kick your ass😂😂😂
&quot;you want see runnin&#39;? you see oosain b0lt&quot;
Hes a cheat he took steroids before the costa fight look at the physic diffewnt
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=265">4:25</a> Joes so confused😂
Yoel I feel you brah. but u also did nothing for 25 mins.😂
Soooooo i guess Israel was right about Costa lol
13
Everybody thought he was just bluffing about Costa but he really did it 🇳🇬👉🏿👌🏿🇧🇷
Real question tho.... why does he Romero sound like bane
I still don’t know why Yoel was complaining about the fight when he was 50% of it
Would really like to see Yoel talking to Till 😂
Izzy ain’t standing still for no one. The best fighters are able to hit w/o getting hit.
Yoel just wants them to hit each other with hammers in the middle of the octagon...I can respect that. The majority of people don’t watch nascar for the laps
*Joe Rogan interviewing Yoel*: Yeah I don&#39;t know wtf you&#39;re saying but I&#39;m going to nod.
&quot;I did what I had to do to win that fight&quot; that&#39;s all you need to know. Playing to your strengths is fine just keep that same energy and don&#39;t act like you wanted the smoke
Usain Bolt 😂
Yoel played smarter and didn&#39;t played Izzy&#39;s game. Though he lost, but man he is a beast.
Romeo sounds like true communist. He does things and blame others.
Any more doubts?
Reason. In 5 rounds you can&#39;t knock Him out , if you&#39;re really better than Him even He is running you defeat Him. And besides, that&#39;s the strategy of champion. It&#39;s a professional fights not street fight.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23andstill">#AndStill</a>

Who is here after izzy tko costa?
No gyno on his right lower peck here. But take a look at the Costa post fight interview.
who&#39;s here after Costa got ko&#39;d 🤣🤣🤣..... izzy mah man erased the eraser
Love yoel.    Best thing bout ISRAEL IS the name ISRAEL.   GODS kingdom
Yoel can&#39;t wrestle for shit despite being an Olympic wrestler. Weird.
Rome needs to respect for romero
Why was Yoel Romero hesitating in the fight?<br><br>You would think the bigger guy would be the aggressor.

Adensanya looks anime at naruto damn
Both Sucked
Everyone wants a war and a straight on brawl. But the most realistic way is the.Floyd Mayweather Jr. way.
WHY NIGERIAN FLAG?
I bet 500 € for adensaya! Tomorrow
I hope I see a different Adesanya on sunday
Well romero I got your point but this is UFC not a street fight. You do what you gotta do to win..
its easier to understand than Paulo Costa..
hello
YOEL RAMEO 💪💪💪

Yoel &quot;Peipaviú&quot; Romero
What do you mean Yoel you just standed in the middle of the octagon doing nothing
He&#39;s right, Adesanya running like a🐓Yoel is the better Fighter point
Israel&quot;look at his leg&quot;Adesanya
I&#39;m really confused with how yall view &quot;running&quot; in a fight. Yoel did nothing but shell up and wait for openings. Adesanya actually tried to engage but as he said &quot;It&#39;s hard to engage with someone that doesn&#39;t want to attack&quot;. Yoel planted his feet in the center as if he was defending a title and not fighting for a championship win and it&#39;s crazy how some people really ripping on the champion for &quot;running&quot;. If you want to see brawls where people just take hits for no reason go to worldstar cuz that&#39;s the professional fighting. He would have been a fool to just continuously attack a shelled up yoel that is clearly waiting for counters and not even attempting to be the aggressor as you would except of a challenger. Another thing to mention is yoel showmanship; this was clearly a horrible performance for his fans, definitely not the fight they came to see. I&#39;m starting to think that most of yall arent in yoel fans just a bunch of adesanya haters
Why is the crowd booing ... Izzy only showed respect
que robo le hicieron a Romero ufc das pena
There will never be another spyder ... this guy Adesanya is good but u can tell is really scared to get k.0 again
Yoel“La Candela“Romero
Lets all be serious😄😄who stood, Yoel stood bt ddnt trade
If you whant the title you must fight yoel
49-46? IMPOSSIBLE
I would love to see Yoel commentating in the UFC
“Yoel how did you feel about the fight?” Yoel: “this is my bitree”
Post fight interview of Yoel was better than the actual fight
yoel is trash lol
Yoel “That is the champ of a US (UFC) in the weeee... and you all you want? No! We want a fight, we wanted a fight the warriors, the really warrior, not like this” Romero
I love Izzy but I want him flattened when he meets Costa
DISNEY ARE RIPPING EVERYONE OFF, ROMERO IS RIGHT. FUCK JOE ROGAN FOR BEING SO BIAST TO THE PUPPET MASTERS. ISRAEL IS THE NEXT UFC HYPE TRAIN THAT WILL DERAIL. PEOPLE PAY FOR SKILL IN FIGHTING NOT DRAMA AND CELEBRITY ENTERTAINMENT. UFC HAS LOST ITS SOUL AND SOLD OUT, IT WILL SINK SOON. ONE CHAMPIONSHIP IS BETTER
When you have to say I screwed his leg up after a win you can tell he doesn’t even think he won
He&#39;s so proud of himself please God this man need to be humble he&#39;s not trye
He trying so hard to be greater talker but he&#39;s not the real champion u guys see why don&#39;t u just give the title to the real champion
I wish Romero swong those hands in the fight and not in the inetview after fight
&quot; I back. &quot;<br><br>- Israel Adesanya
Yoel &quot;Ay hava Questiongg&quot; Romero.
Look how skinny stylebender looks in first 30sec...LOL.

I thought this is UFC, ultimate FIGHTING championship, not RUNNING contest. Adesanya is boring as hell
Okay, UFC officially entered in to sprinting competition🏃🏃
Usain bolt...funny stuff
What he say at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=192">3:12</a> ???
Joe rogan not agreeing is funny 🤣🤣
joe rogan  face while talking to yoel is as if his studying a specimen
Israel &quot;look at his leg look at his leg, i did that&quot; adesanya
I am biased af and don&#39;t fking care lol what a titan Romero, Izzy &quot;with 100 fights&quot; was extremely cautious about walking towards this cuban wrestler guy 💯
&quot;Ill see you soon&quot;
Idk why anybody was expecting Izzy.. to trade with a guy built like Yoel.. thats suicide😂 and he knew that.
the real champion cant dodge strikes he has to take them all to prove he&#39;s the real champion
I don&#39;t think ufc judges can judge . They don&#39;t respect the real fighter ....
WHY U RUNNIN???
As much as I love Romero..it&#39;s like, bruh..fck outta here with that &quot;people pay to see&quot; shit.. you fckd up too big homie.
“I’ll see you soon boi” the MW catchphrase
Israel is the Mayweather in UFC. I&#39;m just sayin.
Fucking idiot
Romero deserve to win
Romero was offended. He refused to take a step back during the fight and yet people say  that he was the one who made the fight boring.
The post fight interview probably got more searches than the actual fight<br>😂
Israel is so cocky. He takes everything personally like after they announced the result, Yoel gave him a sympathetic punch but he acted like a fool. Show some respect to your senior, boy.
Yoel “ LIKE THE GADA-DOR” Romero
Yoel said he would go forward but didnt so not izzys fault hes the champ you want the belt come get it and yoel didnt.
Yoel is a growing young man , should be champ when he’s 50. He’s a very exciting prospect and this kid has a lot of talent. Can’t wait to see him perform in the future.
Izzy so pathetic.  Lol... as I said he didn’t win that fight.  And most importantly those images of his scared face expressions when Yoel was unloading and chasing him, made everyone in the division realize what a fake the middle weight champion is.  And I actually was a fan before this fight.  <br><br>I felt he needed to own up to this performance especially considering all that Macho talk.  Instead, he blamed it all on Yoel, insulted the fans in post fight interviews and claimed he was perfect.  <br><br>Yeah... enjoy the belt.  You certainly ain’t a champ.  Yoel is correct.  Embarrassing champion.
Sorry, but Romero is right. Adesanya is a good fighter, but this wasn&#39;t a good fight from Adesanya. He was on the run!
So many people criticize yoels English. Yoels Spanish is exceptional, while the people criticizing yoels English speak peasant English.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrRSdrAAk7o">https://youtu.be/BrRSdrAAk7o</a> main card prediction
Yoel barely moved 😐
Watch Joe rogan imitation of yoel romero. This is why he was so good at that. He was focusing deep on what yoel was saying
adesanya is always boring to watch..no KO power nothing special about this guy he&#39; just tall and long after all he is nothing all hype..young silva would ripped his head off
He ronnien ronnien and ronnien.... - Yoel Romero
Very Close fight
Adesanya should join marathons, he likes running. hahahaha
andesanya running away from the beast
No doubt, isreal fought and run like ***king shit!!!
A camper angry that another camper is camping? Izzy did his fight yoel, you stood there like a tree
Israel  put all his stats into counter &amp; Mid to long range stirking. Not into in-fighting and Bullish Forward brawling. Yoel put everything into CLose Combat In-fighting &amp; wrestling. You think it makes a fair fight to go inside only? everyone loves a brusier fight with a knockout but tbh this ain&#39;t dog fighting. everyuone has clear styles and we should expect them to use tools that have nothing to do with there styles. If this were normal kickboxing Israel may have been more mid ranged and forward (No chance of takedown or wreslting) But its not. its mma. Watch one of his Kickboxing Fights if you want to see his real Style. (Except for the one where he gets KOed...) it happens...
Blah blah blah
Wow you fucked his leg up thats all you can say that wasnt focus you just ran ran ran ran
Adesanya is a champ thts y he nid to defend it! That&#39;s he&#39;s strategy! Fan&#39;s can&#39;t fight you Romero
I swear bro these translators they get paid for jack shit they&#39;re trashhh
Israel not so popular Adesanya 👎
I&#39;m glad I paid for that fight
Israel is so cool. He&#39;s got real confidence in him.
I want Izzy to lose so bad
Crowd will keep booing izzy
Horrible judgement
You know you didn’t do good when you have to point out what you did after the fight.
the people pe eh eh walking a lot
Because adesanya has participated in a marathon race
Champion who trying to please people he won just by kicking such a disappointment
Israel thinks that a leg kick for 25 minutes win you the game. He does nothing. This fight should cancelled. No winners.
i think yoel might be right. you don&#39;t win like a gladiator by kicking someones leg
Yoel “see you soon boi” Romero
I can&#39;t wait to see Israel Vs Costa 👍💪
they were both being such pussies in the fight lmao
That was like Batman versus Bane. <br>Bane is obviously Yoel Romero.
So many views . I think the only other recent ones are ufc 246 &amp; 242
Adesanya taking Mayweather&#39;s entire fight tactic: Run and Run some more.
The interview is much more entertaining than the fight 😄
Translator: why am I here?<br><br>Romero: he roonin roonin da peepo pay fait no champon
Whaaaat!? Clearly Romero Won!!!
Yoel is so selfless saying how fans deserve a real fight after having paid for PPV and tickets
i cant wait for costa to smash his arrogant face up...
He’s a pussy
stupid playing by farangs! Muay thai match is better than this. MMA fight is like fucking a girlfriend in the kitchen.lol55555 come on the stupid farangs we will kick ur ass by MUAY THAI😎🤛
Both of yall didn’t want to dance.
This is another take on David and Goliath. Clearly everyone knew who won this one.
He can&#39;t run from Costa..🤘🤘
isreal &quot;his legs dont lie&quot; adesanya
Crazy how similar Lyoto Machida and Romero sound : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DXRIbrjHsk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DXRIbrjHsk</a> LOL
Adrenalina Yoel romero
Look I messed up his leg
Don&#39;t understand why Yoel Romero lost. He was definitely the better fighter.
Run kick n run n kick n run n run that how you won lol
Booooooo bboooooooooo
Yoel the King!!
Romero speaking his own dialect
Romero: I hab one question for everybody here... I have here por or at-let
Lmao the guy who’s doing the interview face tells it all...he’s fighting with romero for the mic
Fuck the charges romero won
jon jones laughing
Dare you to run it back?
Not much of a Style Bender on this night.
Israel&#39;s face showed that he was less than pleased with his performance. There&#39;s a difference between avoiding shots and running.
Izzy has one boring fight in his entire career and everyone suddenly turns on him. Dude, Romero is a fighter who thrives on countering his opponents with explosiveness. Izzy is too smart for that so he did what he had to do to win. He hit Yoel with frequent little shots and won on points. It&#39;s a boring fight, but a unanimous win nonetheless. I&#39;m sure Izzy wouldn&#39;t mind exchanging with Romero if Romero actually pushed forward, but like Joe said, Yoel&#39;s attacks were so few and far between. Izzy would evade and reset, then Romero would just stop and wait again. That was the theme the whole fight. Anyone who&#39;s ever been in a fight, especially for sport, knows you need a dance partner to make it exciting. I hope Costa actually goes after Izzy because if so, Adesanya will TKO Costa by the 4th and all these casuals will finally be quiet. Anyone who thinks Costa actually has a shot at beating Izzy outside of a lucky punch clearly doesn&#39;t follow MMA, or Stylebender&#39;s prolific career. Costa is a beast, but Izzy is wayyy to technical for that boy. Can&#39;t wait for September!
Costa will kill adesanya he’s a different kind of beast
Your a fool Israel your reign will not last long
Id love to see yoel sharpen up an beat israel at his own game 👌
Ain’t it sad this was the last fight a live crowd saw 😂
WHY R yu Runin? why R yu Runnin? whayarunnin?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=200">3:20</a> onwards best part of the interview
Romero win 👏👏
He ran like a bitch
Running running running
Solo corre ese negro
He might need a prostheic leg tho😂
When you get kicked too death like that you want too see a fight i think i seen enough..🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=44">0:44</a> I feel like Yoel got kinda angry at him for that
At least Yoel is trying to speak english.. :).
Romero is right the true champion dont run .
He’s like Manny Pacman against Floyd but instead of being quiet, he said everything with no fear. 🤣
So glad I can’t afford the ppv because u would’ve been robbed
He played it smart that’s why he still champion
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H-FiCIMh20">https://youtu.be/8H-FiCIMh20</a><br>The art of fighting without fighting is Izzy running 🏃🏽‍♀️ when Bruce did it it was pure class when iz did it he looked like an ass.
yoel romero vs pacquiao Speech interviews
Yoel is complaining like he did something. He would&#39;ve been gassed out after 2 rounds and then KO&#39;d by Issy
kinda cringe when he went to Paulo and he wasn&#39;t there... this guy&#39;s a joke
You see yoel frustrated multiple times that izzy refuses to stand in front of him,  you don&#39;t see izzy frustrated one bit , izzy was ducking yoel and hoped those legged kicks saved his ass and they sure did
clearly isreal was running from Youel
Israel &quot;running man&quot; adesanya
How Yoel managed to turn the boos on iggy I’ll never know, Yoel is talking as if he didn’t just stand there and do nothing for 25 mins
Ran like a BITCH 🍻☺️
I want to see a rematch so bad.
I hope whoever thought adesanya won, be k.o by some small kids
They just dont wanna give the title to romero which he actually deserved bcos hes old and adesanya being young a rising star, its all marketing tactics
Would love to see Romero fight in a gladiator outfit though
Izzy is good but his attitude is just meeeehh :(
Joe: Did you expect him to stand and trade with you?<br>Yoel: ... Yes.<br>I love Romero but man miscalculated bad for this fight
Im trying so fucking hard to understand Yoels English but, dooode it’s impossible
Yoel you are the Champion bro! Adesanya needs to stop acting like he&#39;s doing something. There is counter strikers and then there is  people running away literally like Adesanya. Can&#39;t wait till Costa chases him down and punishes his ass. If atleast he would admit he&#39;s using a distance approach but he said Yoel didn&#39;t wanna dance? You mean chase you around tirelessly with his head down like and idiot so you can keep running and just throw surprise shots. Fkn be for real. Adesanya and Usman need to start coming with better fights or I&#39;m not even gonna watch title bouts no more. Seems like once they get a hold of the belt they just wanna hug it out or run.
“Bruh look at his leg, look at it!!!”
Respect yoel Romero from Tunisia ! You are a true champion !
And this guy gonna actually come foward and try with me so he know who the moder-efer is fuuuuck espn sorry espn+
Joe&#39;s reaction while Yoel&#39;s talking 😂😂😂😂
Floyd mayweather 2.0
Adesanya run run run and run
Yoel saying that Izzy was running but if you watch the fight you clearly see that Izzy was the one who was keeping the pressure and was attacking and Yoel was the defensive one.
That&#39;s why there&#39;s a cage; there&#39;s a limit to his running. If you are a real gladiator hunt him down. Stop crying. You played safe too from the outset. Chase him; gas out; get knock the F out! Brunson, Gastelum, and Whittaker, etc came to trade; ask them what happened. PPV fans, every day isn&#39;t Xmas...one love!
I wanted izzy to beat costa but after this fight i want costa to win
Is it just me, or the interview were actually better than the fight?
Dude won only off leg kicks only because his opponent didn&#39;t run away but stood in the center instead. Real niggas believe truth, not other humans opinions (judgees)
La propia gente lo abuchea <br>Yoel Romero fue el ganador
Yoel the people&#39;s champ Romero
Do you guys see how joe is looking at Yoel like he’s trying to decipher a riddle 😭😭
Romero Good figure
romero looks like he wearing armor
I was mad because I knew this was the last ufc event with fans, yoel should have went crazy like he did in the Costa fight
Maybe next figh, adesanya vs usain bolt
Fake champ
I&#39;m a israel fan but ain&#39;t no way he won that yoel bullied him
Esse aí e cagao<br>Até eu que não entendo nada de luta correu e só levou na cara kkkkk
He cheated and ran for 23 min took the heavier shots and also got taken down and still won UFC judging is some of the most corrupt out there 💯
Israel was defending Romero should have came after him instead of talking at the end Stylebender deserved his win
Israel won stop if you guys prefer romero that’s different
Only Adesanya can beat bolt too in 25 min. running match.  Was it running competition adesanya vs romero? If it was then there is no doubt adesanya is the champ. Change the name ufc to ufr (ultimate fast runner).
Adesanya very clever fighter
You know you were passive and evasive when you argue in your octagon interview that you hurt your opponent.
AHHAHAHHAAHHAAHAHAHA THIS IS NOT REAL
Romero 👆💪
&quot;Buffonist ignoramus!&quot; <br>&quot;Busta, livin la vida Costa!&quot; Lol<br>The balls on this skinny kid.
Adesanya win????? <br>What happen to ufc now? <br>Marathon event?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=310">5:10</a> “THE PEOPLE...WE Nee..THE FANS NEEDED PAY. THE PEOPLE PAY BECAUSE THE WANNA SAY...SEE THE GOOD FIGHT”.
Yoel fought the same style that got him the L in his other fight Izzy played it smart Yoel should’ve done something different for once
Yoel won I think
Yoel &quot; pay pa pieu &quot; romero
Everyone hating on Adesanya for ‘running’ but It was Romero who messed up, Izzy isn’t stupid he’s not going to stand and trade with Romero, risk getting knocked out and lose his title. He’s the champion so he doesn’t need to push the pace he can fight at his own pace but Romero should’ve applied pressure, I think he could’ve finished Izzy if he did but he fought a very stupid fight just wasted time even in the first round for the first minute he did nothing then did a little dance move, After coming off 3 losses he’s lucky he got another title shot but he ruined it for himself I doubt he’ll get another one
Israel did nothing wrong in this fight and he deserved that victory 100% ... YOU are the one trying to get the belt, why dont YOU attack ? Instead he stood on one spot for like a minute ... Israel was the guy DEFENDING the belt, therefore Yoel needed to do waaaaay more than just landing 2 or 3 overhand strikes ... fight like a man or stop crying like a baby
Both fighters are to blame for this boring fight
Post fight interview in a nutshell<br>Israel: I fucked his legs up Paulo Costa see u soon boi <b>insert cussing in other language</b><br>Yoel: <b>pE pUl PaE fOr ReAl fIgHt, No ThIs! If YoU wOn RunNiN, UsAiN bOlT</b>
Yoel is right
And people used to say Mayweather was always running. At least he landed punches while doing so 😂😂😂
Israel is the biggest pussy eater.
If you want to see ronning go see Usain Bolt 😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂he said if u wanna see runnin go see Usain bolt 😂😂
Hahaha look who&#39;s talking😂🤣 hes the most boring fighter and talking about people jsut cuz they cheered him lol
If costa was&#39;nt that brave......that (costa vs romero) fight would be trashed like this fight......in that fight yoel fought like Israel did in this fight<br>Yoel is definitely the last in those three fighters<br>Yoel also didn&#39;t have the guts to attack and put pressure on Israel like Costa did to him<br>Yoel is not thatgood and brave
Usain Adesanya🏃🏾‍♂️
Fuck this adenshitya
Running like a girl
Joe’s face trying to understand Romero 🤨
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=240">4:00</a> HAHAHA I&#39;m dying Yoel is the funniest guy Yoel language is the funniest thing I ever seen 😂😭

Can someone explain to me why or what Yoel was even doing in this title fight when he currently was on a 2 fight losing streak ? Same thing with Aldo against Yan . That really devalues the titles when guys who are on losing streaks are still getting rewarded with title shots . Makes zero sense and makes ufc look like a joke .
Most boring fight in the history of UFC.
Yoel Romero is not 6ft. More like 5,9  or 5,10.
Lol for the first time Yoel Romero didnt raise his hands thinking he won...heck even Israel... this match was a real game of chess
joe:how did u feel abot the fight<br>yoel:datyjbkpppyteeweqaxxgbkmmbteshuil
Paulo costa
yoel sound like bane from dark night lmfaoo
I forgot how bad the boo-ing was at the end of the fight.  Let the people speak -- Romero is a champ.
Adesanya sucked but yoel didnt do shit either....why the fuck is yoel talking about paying for water and not whiskey because yoel wouldn&#39;t k how the difference between both values anyways
Adesanya was scared as FUCK, feared the Soldier of God. Romero won that fight, he actually wanted to be in the octagon Lol<br>He&#39;s gonna run from Paulo Costa aswell.. Honestly I rather not see Adesanya fight at all, it&#39;s like watching maybe late in his career.
Thankfully Weili and Joanna were there to save the event
Yoel is someone I would NEVER wanna fuck with
Theres no humble in israel
Yoel “PEI PO PEWW” Romero
49/46???
Yoel is a joke. Where is his stamina, just juiced up.. He has power, but no stamina. And he did not engage, Yoel was a let down.
Poor yoel, very low fight IQ, doesn&#39;t realise it&#39;s a sport first, fight second.
People are mad but I don’t see you in the ring fighting Yoel!
Borrachinha tem mais bomba que a Coreia do Norte
To me, a champion is supposed to be ruthless and show everyone why they are the champion. To be honest, paulo should be the true champ. It should&#39;ve been yoel, but he is like izzy.... a counter puncher. Paulo backs it up and mows you down.
Yoel complaining about Izzy running and the people wanting to see a real fight . Wtf was he doing , he was just standing there and all he did was 2 or 3 flurries. The ufc should fire Yoel for what he did .
The funny thing was how Izzy said: &quot;look at his leg, he&#39;s going to be limping after this..&quot; but in reality Yoel was chilling and training the following day vs Izzy had to take off 6 months from fighting because he damaged his own legs with the kicks he landed on Yoel LMFAOOO
Terrible fight
What is Romero expected? that Israel to get in touch and take punch!?😅 <br>Romero is a  great Fighter but lsrael have done everything, to win the fight 💪
Call me GSP because I was not impressed with their performance
Otro robo a Yoel.....ufff gue vergüenza
Lets be honest guys. Yoel didn’t do shit in the fight. As a smaller and more muscular man you can’t expect the taller guy to trade bombs with you
I just don&#39;t understand Y they keep Robbing Romero! It&#39;s sad it come to an Image.... An a 40 yr old Champ isn&#39;t in there Picture... They&#39;ve Robbed this man right in his Face 3 times in a Roll... Just like they did shevchenko against Nunez TWICE! Watched both numerous times... Just look at Nunez face 1st fight, she herself was surprise... Look at Shevchenko first 2d fight, she like (Forreal, this how yall gone do me)....  I mean only round Robert Whitaker won against Yoel was 1st... Maybe another, but was close to being ended, he got beat the Fuck up... An they still gave Whitaker the fight. Costco was the closes an Yoel still won, Costco was swinging missin, more then landing... It&#39;s Sad its become this corrupt, Fighters not in there image gotta Finish fouls... Except Jons, he use to be, thats forsure... Yoel Romero is the Middleweight Champion in the eyes of anyone who isnt blind.... Lol
Everyone in this comment section ripping in Adesanya are fucking retards
Adasanya bum romero lion heart
Israel is luser
Lol
Israel run and won but he talks like he destroyed Romero or something
Adesanya took a dent in this.... not impressed.
I hate both of these are shit how did izzy become champion hes shit
Run forest run 🏃🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man Yoel got pissed toward the end of the last round! He suddenly realized he stood around waiting the whole fight and was about to lose. Yoel ranting at the end about Israel running was just cringe he himself spent 90% of the fight standing around doing fuck all.
Just realized that Yoel sounds like Bane in this interview 😂😂
No running with Costa... 😉
I come every once in a while here to have a good laugh
It&#39;s been 4 months and i still don&#39;t know what Yoel&#39;s tryna say
What the fuck did yoel say
Mais toi aussi Roméo la cage est complètement fermé si tu étais un 🦁 tu pouvais le mangé mais on constate que tu n&#39;es pas à la hauteur😂😂
Should’ve cut their wages and give it to the ladies
Israel &quot;Bolt&quot; Adensaya
Yeol is the one who was running n saying that for israel
He sounds a little like bane
Running it&#39;s called defense learn it most important thing about fighting look at floyd 50to0
Is running even legal? Lmfao
After seeing that fight with him against kelvin gastelum that was a war fights like that will take a massive toll on your health. Smart move by israel.
Romero &lt;3 he&#39;s furious
“I luv you mike I luv you”
Yoel is a crazy roid head .. Izzy won fair and square
Israel Adesanya is wack. He promised he would destroy Romero,NOT, oh please “look at his leg” I didn’t know that’s how he was suppose to destroy Romero that way by kicking him in the leg.  Shut up dude, too much talking and a lot of running around.  P.S. Romero was robbed big time.
Yoel Romero is actually really smart and shows serious technique awareness when he speaks in Spanish. Not an olympian for nothing.
Israel&quot;look at his leg&quot;Adesanya
Yoel dead sounds like my dad whenever he talks about boxers now💀
I like you Izzy, but Paulo will destroy you
I&#39;m not a Yoel Romero fan but he got robbed
The people where angry because they didn&#39;t see want they want to see. but adesanya did win, and he used his tools well, he has the speed and the reach, that is why he is the better fighter. He&#39;s not a meathead like others
In Mortal Kombat Israel is Jade and Romero is Shao Kahn.
This fight was so boring I went into the bathroom and shaved my beard. I was going stir crazy.
I might be biased but I thought Yoel won this fight
Israel Mastered the art of fighting. He’s a great Champion that fight according to his will no one can make him lose focus he finds a weakest and attack.. Great Job Israel!!
Congratulaysions To Israel Adesanya For Defending His Ufc Middleweight Championship For The 1st Time Aginst Yoel Romero And Now He Would Be Setting Up To Defend His Middleweight Championship For A 2nd Time Aginst Brazilian Paulo Costa That Would Be A Completly Different Fight For Israel
Yoel bottled it 😂
Yoel can&#39;t fight he lost his last 3 before this fight🤣🤣
Costa, beat this marathoners for me.🤣
Joe Rogans face is so underrated when Yoel was speaking
Adesanya killed himself for running
Joe is just trying to understand what is Yoel trying tosay
I just don&#39;t like andesaya
@Yoel..what a madness after lossing the fight ! The winner is the champion !! If the runner win this fight why do&#39;nt you stop him from running? Boy you just lost your title shot,you cannot backward  the fight to start over...complaining after losing mean&#39;s you are more afraid of him!! Naw lzzy has alredy piss you off.more than that just give up like as silvia does &quot; naw you are champ&quot; then it will be the best for you instead of peekaboo.OK.
Yoel spits bars 😂😂
How are they so sweaty... ? From dancing? 😂😂😂
Yoel Romero is the champ
If you want to see Rooney go see Russian Ball 😂😭🤣😭😂😭🤣
Who were the judges? Idiots
Honestly Romero shouldn’t boast about anything.When you try to win over the fans and try to brain wash them into thinking Adesanya was scared. Both fighters were relatively scared of each other.Adesanya was scared of Romero’s Power,Romero was scared of Adesanya’s technique.
Yoel &quot;if you want go see roonin, go to see Hussain ball&quot; Romero
From tanzania am saying no body can figth with adezanya
I love how they hugged...had the feeling he was really fine with it...
big roremo
Israel maywedder
Joe Rogan has no idea what he was saying😂
Yoel romero is win , romero champion for middleweight divition in ufc and beat fighter in this divition .
Israel adesaya The run champion
Strong romero
Before the fight: &quot;See you soon&quot;<br>After the fight: &quot;See you soon&quot; <br>Between: &quot;See you later&quot;
Israel Adesanya is my new idol .. he has the spirit to fight the whole world even it turns against him.
Adasyna was running around  haha
Common guys stoping the bullshit lies , remaro clearly won the fight so what’s all this about
Compare this title defense to, Jon Jones vs Thiago Santos. This fight was soo weak on Isreals behalf. To call out somebody and fear them throughout the fight was ridiculous.  Notice the chin punch pokes which happened twice to Isreals chin after the fight. Acosta will beat his azz!!!
Romero take the L bro.... You lose...... Take a walk man.
&quot;de pipol pey pa pa piu&quot; -Yoel Romero
Shakira- the hips dont lie<br>Adesanya the legs dont lie
israel is annoyingly smart
If u want to see running see Usain Bolt omg that was so good for that moment.
I didn&#39;t think a so called &quot;decision win&quot; could get any more lame and piss poor than Jon Jones &quot;win&quot; over Reyes the previous month but boy was I wrong.   Not only was this a shit fight but all Adesanya did was stop Romeros take downs and bruise up the inside of his leg.   Romero rocked him with some bombs in the face that he had no answer for.   Jon even deserved his win more than Adesanya did and the UFC judges should seriously get drug tested before every event cause they&#39;re slippin hard sometimes.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=242">4:02</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=247">4:07</a> romero said thus is the real shampoo for 200 thousand
nasty judges
sux they didnt bang it out. hopefully issy costa is good
Pobre ramiro <br>Experimenta las leyendas de los católicos romanos Son sus conquistadores, estúpido
Adesanya sucks
Adesanya: trust me I’m French I can go another 5 rounds...more like 5 miles🏃🏿‍♂️
Yoel Romero  wın
i fucked his leg up........oh my god, you shouldn&#39;t try to explain to audience that are booing you how it was really a good fight, they just fucking watched it, shame shame shame
Adesanya is scared shitless horrible champion
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23adesanya">#Adesanya</a> will enjoy watching this <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzzpGOsgtHs">https://youtu.be/DzzpGOsgtHs</a>
He is very a good and bad actor in the very same time. Very unique. Very bizarre
romero ne bos yapmissin be
Yoel is awesome lmao. &quot;the people pay to see us fight, not see a guy running away, if you want to see a guy running then go see usian bolt&quot;.
I thought boxing fan were bad but it’s like MMA fans expect the fighter to get brain damage 😂😂
THIS IS MY BICTORY
those tattoos are paid vainly, they are invisible...
yoel romero win .<br>such a shame on UFC juges
Joe Rogan : 🥴
HE RUNNING HE RUNNING AND RUNNING LOL
Israel &quot; I&#39;m gonna be the first to properly stop him &quot; Adesanya 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️😂😂😂
Yoel wanted Izzy to stand still and trade punches with him. He thought if he could annoy him enough that he would get frustrated and bored and give in to his dumb ass game plan.
s rico<br>THE great Hickey Martin costa has broken many people in and out of the octagon. The sluts in the clubs have had their assholes broken by this beast man and another asshole gender bender adisinous will literally b a broken native after Hickey Martin makes an example of him!!!!
Romero halfed his fan base with this farce. Had to nerve to blame Adesanya, a counter striker half his size. As if Adesanya should have been the one attempting take downs. Romero has been unlucky with decisions in the past and made sure that he wasn&#39;t going to be caught by some upstart kid. That&#39;s fine, play it safe all you want but don&#39;t blame the other guy. This kind of mentality is why he&#39;ll never be a champion and Dana won&#39;t give him another shot.
I love yoel cuz he cares bout dapeepo
🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
You can tell Joe was trying so hard to understand Yoel, but couldn´t keep up
Censored Quietly. Thank You, UFC, if You have to censor.
israel “the leg don’t lie” adesanya
The fight was total bad man none of them won for me BOO to that fight not tryna be rude😜😜😜
Thank god the women’s fight rocked. The two title fights were like night and day.
“You don’t need 10 rounds with a man!” At least Rob beat Yoel in an exciting fashion
Yoel always gets done over by the judges.
Mann look at joe,s face when romero is talking 😂😂
blah blah blah adesanya blurry
Why was Yoel talking like he was more active than Israel throughout the fight? Because based on what my eyes saw during that event, he was literally standing still most of the time and hopping around from time to time. He did nothing.
“If you stay around till you are 50 I will see you soon”
Romero got outplayed...it is not about staying in the middle and trading punches when there is that much muscle mass diff...Isrsel played real smart.
Israel Adesanya is a dummy.<br>Dont u ever compare him to the Notorious Conor McGregor ever.<br>He has never delivered such a dummy fight.
Un verdadero robo,  Romero fue el vencedor
At the end yoel makes sense..and appreciate his loss
Yoel Romero won this fight. Fuck the JURY. this is ridiculous.
If anyone needs a translation of Yoel&#39;s speech:<br><br><br>&quot;I&#39;m mad he didn&#39;t walk into my range and give me ample opportunity to counter&quot;
This fight is definitely making it into Izzy&#39;s &quot;legacy&quot;
Para mí ese Israel es un corre camino , es mejor q se retire de la UFC , es una vergüenza como peleador.
Please look at Joe Rogan trying to understand Yoel 😂😂😂😂
Some of y’all are spoiled y’all wanted to see a war between Israel and Romero and Israel plays chess. Romero is awesome but he isn’t smarter than Izzy. Appreciate the chess game between them and stop being so spoiled not every fight gonna have blood shed💯 Team Izzy Team Khabib 💯💯
Yo whoever is mad that Israel didn’t go to war with Romero. Stop to think how Israel was brave enough to call out Romero. Also stop bitching bruh, a smart wise man is strategic and plays chess. Clearly Romero is physically stronger than Israel. Fighting isn’t only about strength it’s about technique and mind game. Israel is a mind genius and Romero is frustrated. Please comment if you disagree cuz y’all idiots wanna see Israel lose his focus and he not about to play anyone else’s game. He has his own strategy and he will always stick to it
Yoel&#39;s interview is nice but still loss lol
Romero basically saying that adesanya should stay in the middle and maybe stay still to get hit.maybe next time we should give him the belt without a fight. What a pussy reaction.childish sore loser.he wouldnt say none of that if he was the one with more landing hits.israel was.and he won.end of story
Rogan&#39;s shoe lifts are like 3 inches tall.
Lame ass.. <br>Israel: Look at his leg.. He can&#39;t walk<br>Romero: wrong sport, He&#39;s a 🏃 Runner lmao
They should run it back, they owe it to the millions that paid to watch this fight
I had so much respect for izzy until he started bragging about yoels leg
Romero:The people is working hard and pay for the fight, not fight like this, people wants good fight not running like this!
Pathetic ass shit
I feel bad,Yoel should’ve won that,he actually wanted to fight,i like Israel but he only can go 5 more Cs he ran
Oh the owner of the video, there is a video that has been deleted on Romero and Israel in which nine minutes with rap music they deleted in April. Can it be brought back to watch?
It&#39;s a trick Romero is the winner 🥇👍
Yoel yg dapat zebb telak,malah israel yang juara..macam mana pula ini!!
Lets say the dance battle was the real fight
Yoel you are crazy . You keep shouting see you soon but you couldn&#39;t do anything
Yoel sounding like my drunk father
Romero win this one 🤣🤣 adesanqya runing guy 🤣🤣
Costa to Adesanya: See you soon, runner.....
yoel was right .fight like a men in the middle not running around  like a chicken
Adesanya champ
It&#39;s Romero&#39;s fault, clearly.
Yoel is right. This guy is no real champion. Mans 42 and still sparks fear in this Nigerian Neegaah’s chicken heart.
When you expect mutton biryani but you get dhal rice
For me yoel romero win..
Just watched this again on ESPN+. I almost fell asleep. What a lame-ass borefest!
What was that? Social distancing?
This interview is better than the fight for sure
shut the fuck up romero you fucking fridge
I hate yoel I hope he never becomes champion....it seems like every fight he has is for the belt and he loses every time...he just needs to quit trying to talk English I mean Jesus don&#39;t let him talk without a translator he just sounds stupid it&#39;s the only part I actually feel bad for him about I mean the dudes first language is not English lol....but Israel is an even bigger douchebag also you don&#39;t stand there and bash your oponent and call him out after you beat him sayin look at his leg look at his leg right now standing there talking like he&#39;s some kind of God or something....he really thinks he&#39;s something special and kept going as the whole crowd boos him lol.... That division needs some new guys to step up and take it over and get the top 3 out of there...i can&#39;t think of the guy who had the belt before Israel but that&#39;s probably bc he fights 1 time every 2 years...no one wants to see a champ not fight....so hopefully some new younger guys step up in that division and get those guys out of there
This guys the future!
Yoel was saying bring it! You are the champ, you said you are going to knock me out....bring it so we can go. I understand it&#39;s a two way street. Understand, Izzy is the champ....why is it that the challenger must take it? I blame both yeah, I blame Izzy I bit more because if you are the king of the jungle, show the world that!
1 month after the fight still don&#39;t know what yoel was saying . Lol
👎🏼👎🏼 🗑
Vaya mierda de campeón, ojalá venga Paulo Costa y le parta bien la cara.
UFC DANA IS A MAFIA. CRIMINAL
Ufc Romero vs Israel
Israel is coward Romero is a winner
Voy a ser el primero en noquear a este viejo 👴... palabras de Israel..... pero rápido se dio cuenta que eso era imposible y que si atacaba a Romero sería él quien acabaría durmiendo.... fue listo Israel , mantener la distancia y que pasen rápido los minutos, la primera vez que vi el miedo en Adesanya,
Romero taking no responsibility for how this  turned out is the most disappointing thing of all.  This isn&#39;t boxing. If someone&#39;s running, you&quot;re allowed to lung at them and wrestle them to the floor.
Romeo respect
This guy ran around the ring the whole fight fights like Mayweather
adesanya looks more sweaty than yoel
Romero 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Wow! I never thought Israel would beat Yoel.
Honestly, this fight was the most retarded fight i have seen in my life
Yoel won
dey people want hu see the huud FITE!!
Yoel is very stupid  because he didn&#39;t attack adesanya who has the belt ...You expected the champs to come and meet you...HELL NO ......Paolo costa next ...Congrats CHAMPS ....ISREAL ADESANYA
This are the smartest fighters to ever face eachother that none of them wanted to play the other guys game that&#39;s why it looks wierd to you&#39;ll who&#39;ve never been in a ring/octagon b4..😀
Yoel cant say they wanna fighting champion when he doesn’t wanna go after izzy cause he’s scared to get dropped like Whittaker 🤣
respect Romero the guy has true fighters heart. izzy is a disgrace to the fight game talking all this stupid shit about how he fd up Romeros leg....only casuals with no fight IQ think that shit was impressive, he a coward who has no heart if you a champ fight like one you called Romero out saying you was gonna ko him and retire him, izzy bitch got hit hard and ran the rest of the fight and only used the leg kicks to keep distance because he was scared
is Yoel  the better and stronger fighter ? yes<br>is he the one to blame for the boring fight? yes
these fucking casuals smh what is adesanya suppose to do he&#39;s the champ, yoel stood there if he wants the belt go fucking get it...show out he didn&#39;t. The fight was boring but it is what it is, blame yoel for that he didn&#39;t engage when he didn&#39;t have anything to lose
El MAS grande robo en UFC.<br>Claramente Romero ganó la pelea.
Romero 1,2,4,5
Honestly the most interesting fight I have ever seen.<br>Despite not seing some disfigured!<br>I think people just don&#39;t get how much control about their body these two athletes have.<br>Moving for them is not like throwing a limb, it is a whole body explosion with all the muscle fibers being tensed up to move in a certain direction.<br>The underlying strategy and intersutuational tactics of each fighter had to be adjusted to the opponent. And if the opponent is a being with enourmas potential to hurt you, it would be downright stupid to think you can throw a combination of something without the second person in the fight dealing some dangerous counterdamage.<br>Appreciate this art, shut up or do it better to own up to what you are saying.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=336">5:36</a><br>If oo want to seeeee ryunning, go seeee da Oosain Boult
It’s like Diaz vs Silva. One wanted to fight their own style, the other wanted to play politics.
The most SUCK fight ever🤑🤑🤑
i c u soon boi
Yoel Romero talked the truth
Hahahahaha Yoel is fuckin hard loser
yoel should back up what he&#39;s saying....  not just stick his hands up...
No that&#39;s all you did was touch his leg. You did nothing to Yoel.  The couple punches Yoel hit Izzy with hurt Izzy more than anything Izzy touched Yoel with
Fight at time of 👑virus: social distancing! 🤣
Israel &quot;Like I Said&quot; Adesanya
HONEST MISTAKE! Both thought they were doing a very light contact sparring match as a demonstration of MMA. Only after it did they realize it was meant to be full contact. Massive FART NOISE to both fighters they embarrassed themselves and the UFC. Romero was pathetic and never tried, Adesanya ran away and did just enough to win = BORING!!!!!!!!
ROMERO MAN...adesanya pussy...is not CHAMPION.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY">0:00</a>
romero was spot on !  israel just looked like the last rooster at a butchers shop trying to run away throughout the fight. disgraceful
Take ur losss and gway cho!!

Costa vs Romero 2
romero le dio su tanda . que pendejada
The best thing he did was complain it is sports  not street fight ,of course izzy would stick to his game plan and do what he really wanted to do.
fuck you adasanya the real winner is romero&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.
If Yoel vs Saenchai..that leg Wil Fracture...
Let&#39;s not forget yoel is a cheater he will do anything to win. I am not surprise he acting like he wants to fight but did nothing for 5 rounds.
Y&#39;all captions is messed up bro.
Yoel is demanding for a fight and what you did in the 1st and 2nd round? Man, walk the talk. Look at your legs, that&#39;s busted and you still don&#39;t see Israel fighting?
Y con esa pelea pala verga esos weyes se hicieron multimillonarios
This was the most fake fight ever. The UFC should fold. You can&#39;t be a bloodsport and fake like pro boxing. It was like bad pro wrestling but all a big lie. Toe Blowgan gives it away.
Running chicken, Adesnaya~!!!  No Fun No more Game~ Sayonara~UFC!
Costa i see you son booi
Fk Dat Kuiet mabro
It´s so easy to complain when you have lost.
Yoel is the real champ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=290">4:50</a> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yoel Romero win
Wtf the worst fight ever , women can fight better this is not ufc 😫
They should&#39;ve sanctioned 5 more rounds knowing what we dealing with now
Both Romero &amp; Adesanya will go down in history as having the worst championship fight in the history of the sport. What a legacy.
If octagon was smaller in size, Izzy would be an average fighter or below!
Real champ Romero 💪
Remembering this I feel good that I didn&#39;t get up in 5am in the morning to watch this fight,<br>I was thinking that it will be epic, but now I am sure Paulo Costa will fucked up this dancing moneky very bad./
Adesanya: Threw and Landed more strikes than Romero nearly every round<br><br>Romero: He was running!
I think this fight is set up.. Romero gave the match..<br><br>I watched romero vs costa fight.. hes a fighter but here he play safe not to be hurt...
Romero should finish israel guy <br>Very prideful guy <br>Romero will click his Ass one day
Israel &quot; the Counter-Style bender &quot; Adesanya!<br>Overhyped fighter : fights not to win but not to lose.
Run Adesanya  run.. Like mayweather 😂
Could we ever see Adesanya VS. MasVidal???
Romero is a bad loser .its not ab standing and trade.its ab techniek .if i was Israël i should never stand-and trade becuz thats not the strategie To fight u
Adesanya:I did what I had to do.<br>Me: Is it pretending to be usain bolt?!??
Israel is the champion Yoel should&#39;ve fought harder to get the belt End of Story... NEXT
Getting in a war didn&#39;t work for Joanna. Would you rather look like you fell down a set of stairs or walk away champ looking fresh?
Romero in won
Adesanya fuck U You cannot do that in jone bones .. bones will break your nick
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5ugONBoBvU">https://youtu.be/n5ugONBoBvU</a> temon
Personne ne risquerait de se ruer sur Roméro et de finir KO au bout de 30 second. Le fight c&#39;est pas seulement aller donner des coups, c&#39;est le game plan et Izy a parfaitement respecté ce qu&#39;il avait prévu. En plus il était le plus entreprenant presque tout le combat. Yoel était toujours attentiste cherchant le KO ce que Izy ne lui a pas permis d&#39;obtenir
Real champion Yoel Romero ! ❤️💪 <br>Many 💲 champion Silva !
Yoel was so pissed off he didn&#39;t even need the guy to translate for him. lol
Resultado manipulado , Romero campeão.
Yoel weak asf for this fight , glad I didn’t waste no coin
Rematch!!!Probing noooo!!! you didn’t want to get close to a monster.
Thank God for Yoel Romero. Sad though the the real OG of the game are in their late days... He is the people&#39;s champ anyway and the BMF of that division!
Romero no hizo una mierda, el nigeriano tampoco pero obviamente no iba arriesgar su cinturón!!
Let&#39;s get a diaz boy vs adesanya
Why wasn&#39;t Yoel playing offensive? I guess after 40, it&#39;s no more adrenaline but adrelina.<br>N.B.<br>He, himself, said it @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=265">4:25</a>... 😁
Good
Pipol pay peper view no di runny
Bitch u can go another 5 round cause u haven&#39;t right yet untill the fight is over 🤣 fuck u isreal
Hahahaha 👍🏻
UFC started to pick the winner based on who will get more pay per view, not on who is the real winner. Jon and Bolt proves that
Solid punches from Yoel on winner&#39;s face. The winner didn&#39;t landed any.
But still adesanya is the best👍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=242">4:02</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=247">4:07</a> Someone translate this
If izzy beats costa. Who the hell is going to dethrone adesanya
Da pipol pay for fight nou ronin no.!
Yoel Romero 🏆🏆🏆
Watch it again, use a timer of need be, Izzi had more forward motion and center ring control.  <br>If you&#39;re the challenger, you&#39;re the one with something to prove, so stop hanging back! Bring the fight to the champ!<br>And Still
If i wanna see running i see Hussain Bolt!
lol feel bad for Romero next opponent, someone is gonna get sent to mars
Is he gon be a political leader for Cuba (for the people)? 😂
UNTIL ISRAEL KILL YOU WITH HIS WONDERFUL LEG...... You will know those people would watch another fight after you go... do you hear the LION he can go more 5 round...lol
Romero is people&#39;s World champion.
Why romeo is loser?
Pemenang sebenarnya sangat jelas...Yoel the monster romero
Romero is better
Yoel 1,3,5 easy. Adesanyas just trying to convince himself he won. I guess Dana wants a champ who’s cool with the kids.
What a complicated scenario 🤦
Adesanya should have traded more
Even Floyd doesn’t run as much as Isreal.
Broken english israel is the best
Yoel es más luchador, si quieren ver gente correr vean a Usain 👏👏

Idol Yoel Romero you are right..we aim to watch a good fight, not  watching a running man execution..people paid to watch this fight 💪 but seems not satisfied 😡
Yoel &quot;peepel pay &quot; romero
Ufc = gringos corruptos oooiii
What&#39;s the losser saying please?<br>It&#39;s like a team in uefa champions league final, complaining about the other team being too defensive  as thier reason to loose.😁😁
The real champ
Krasser Angeber 😂
No estuvo tan buena la pelea
RESPECT To this man
When i start watching mma 10 years ago it was way more brutal, now its like a wwe funny story bro
I love yoel Romero
YOEL DI BEE SHAMPION
Adesanya mocking Romero&#39;s injured leg was pathetic. So unprofessional.
Only on ufc.     I think you can curse on espn1 never on boxing
Goo bless
Yoel did the most damaging strikes and and take down, put fear in him and made him run but apparently kicking a leg is what wins you fights 🤦🏽‍♂️ honestly didn&#39;t believe it when people say the UFC is rigged now I can see why they&#39;d say that 💯
🔥🔥🔥 <br> a tough fight <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0atug3XxODY&amp;t=82">1:22</a> 💛❣ <br>  👇👇👇❣
The only thing i hear is “i’ll see you soon boi” but nothing ever actually happens
💣
Cowboy before, now Romero.. F**k this UFC
Izzy said &quot;if you stay around til you 50 I&#39;ll see you soon boy&quot; man ima otaku dancer and mma practitioner just like izzy look up to him crazy but izzy you lost madddd respect from me on this one. Weakest shit you ever pulled. Whatever gets the win i guess
Adesanya Chicken running looser
I think yoel and he is team don&#39;t know what is tecnical fight, adesanya is a very smart Guy as yoel standing waisting time, adesanya was making big money, much love Israel Adesanya, i love you boy...
Adesanya is a great fighter master🥰
Stylebender took his style! Bad matchup xD
Romero are the champion
Expect to see more of a running game from Israel Bolt. Hahaha
He can take Yoel&#39;s best shot? Damn🤣. Just run boy.
Israel was a bitch in this fight. How do you call someone out and not push the action? He got hit and got scared, as he should. But you call someone out and then stay away and are proud of a leg kicking decision, sad. He&#39;s a great fighter but don&#39;t call someone out if you ain&#39;t willin to bang with em.
I just witnessed a Pacquiao-Mayweather fight
Do you want to see running, go to see Spongebob..
Yoel :The people want to see the really &quot;Adelina&quot;... Hmm Adelina is my sexy neighbour..
God bless Isreal Adesanya,,,,,,, u are the best fighter..
Romero is talking trash.... how do u think that guy willl stay there waiting for your punch.... who does that. If u are in fight u need to have style and stamina to beat your opponent..... Israel will beat him because He can survive many rounds but those over big guys cannot
What the fuck.... Romero is best
This was a boring fight... he talks so much but it wasn’t even a good fight...
Gay adesanya the running man! Hahahaha of ufc!
Africa will robb you and take all
Boooo.your a younger than he..and your RUNNNNNNNINGGGG..and call yourself a champion..pweeee..
This fight proved how average Adesanya is, no confidence in his own skill set to engage with or finish Romero. Ran around the ring and stayed on the outside to bore out a points victory (which could have gone either way). Average champion.
I think Adesanya is guilty here, he said he chose Romero because he wanted to prove he could stop him. So Romero&#39;s spent a camp training for a counter attack style. This was Adesanya&#39;s fault.
Romero won...plain and simple. Romero had hard hits, takedown, ring control, and had Adesanya running away the whole time. Lil&#39; Izzy slapped Romero&#39;s leg a few times and won because of that. And don&#39;t play that whole, oh, &quot;get hit in the leg by a martial artist&quot; BS...you don&#39;t have legs like Romero. So stop cause you sound like some local city MMA amateur...if someone like Luke Rockhold says it hurts kicking him, I&#39;ll believe that over some YouTube comment artist. All of the professional MMA fighters agree and had Romero winning that fight.
How come adasenya win? He is not fight he is running in there. Did they see??🤣🤣
Man, I couldn&#39;t understand like 45% of what Yoel Said
Congrats to our Israel Adesanya! Nigerians are proud of you.<br><br><br>Full blooded Yoruba !
it’s almost as if Romero is speaking a language of the gods and whatever alcohol you had when you watched this live determines what you interpret from his interview
Haven&#39;t paid for anything in ten years my mom and dad are the real suckaz😎
This guys a fucking tool lol
Some many excuses you now you lose 🙄🙄🙄
Israel you lose....running is no fight
This fight is a joke 🥵🥵🥵🥵
Yoel Romero should have won. <br><br>He is the people&#39;s champ!  ❤
Adasanyah you talk too much shit it won&#39;t be long you will be knocked out cold...Boooooooooooohhhh!!!!
Romero is the champion 💪
If Yoel was under 30, he would’ve won all of the fights that went the distances. Romero won this one. Romero is an insane athlete, wish him the best. Costa vs Izzy would be entertaining
The champ just said it&#39;s hard to fight when someone doesnt want to ingadge,Hello that was u Mr kick and run,wtf
i hate ufc fans. they can suck a fat dick..
Yoel winner..not....bla2
He ran 5 times  for  hes life  u can tell he was  fearful..it was clear  as day. He scampered like  a chicken  running  for  his life.
El cinturón más adsurdo de la UFC y puso en ridículo a Dana W, decepción total
Usain Bolt vs Israel A.
Izzy fought his strategy<br>Romero should of pushed
“The people walking alot. They don’t wanna see running!”  -Romero
Adesanya
I dont think the judges like romero 😂
Champ gets booed out of the arena. <br>Next..
Le partieron los pies a yoel perdistes eso lo bio todo el mundo✌
Damn Yoel Romero spoke nothing but FACTS. People pay their hard earned money to see a real fight. Not that bullshit. Lol he said &quot;if you wanna see running you go see Usain Bolt.&quot; He was clearly afraid to exchange with Yoel. That&#39;s not how a real champion fights.
Izzy beat him so badly his leg didn&#39;t work properly but everyone saying Romero won like a dumb birch
This guy blows on the stick
How can people blame Adesanya..he’s the champ, if your opponent isn’t willing to bring it or put it on you then why risk your game, why risk getting hurt when you can just do what needs to be done to get the win. It’s like Floyd Mayweather, people can say he’s boring but he’s the champ and if the opponent is coming for a pay check and aint willing to take risks and take the fight to floyd why should floyd risk getting hurt or going to his opponent. It’s an easy win. Romero missed his opportunity..
Israel ‘The Last Marathoner’ Adesanya
Fuck you israel
I&#39;m rather late to comment but just have to get this off my chest.<br><br>Firstly, in my view, to blame the fighters for a boring fight is absurd. These are two athletes at the highest level competing for a world championship, and we get to watch. They do not owe us anything. What we&#39;re paying for is not to see an action movie or Kung fu street performance where the main point is to entertain the audience. Rather as stated, it&#39;s a competition for a world championchip. That&#39;s what we&#39;re paying to watch (those who pay anyway). They have dedicated their entire life to get to this point, and stepping into the octagon they have an opportunity to leave it as a world champion. You better believe they&#39;re gonna do whatever it takes to do that. With this in mind it should seem rather absurd to then expect them to try entertain us. No! They&#39;re gonna try to win the fucking world title! How can we blame them for that!?<br><br>So with this in mind it seems to me as though to judge this fight in terms of the extent to which it entertained us fans completely lacks perspective.<br><br>Secondly, to primarily blame Adesanya for how the fight went is also absurd in my view. Romero mostly just stood there. How is Adesanya the one to blame here? But like I wrote earlier I don&#39;t think either of them is to blame here.
Lasagna turned out to be a real pussy.<br>After calling out Romero &amp; putting on a performance like <a href="http://that.one/">that.One</a> overhand left in the  1st round then all he had was kick &amp; run..Shameful. Romero blew it. Glad l didn&#39;t pay for this shit
Yoel needs to shut up, he was running as well. The fans were expecting you to wrestle Adesanya but you were afraid to approach him.
Fight more and talk less. Just a matter of time till he gets &quot;micheal paged&quot;.
just fuck that crowd
the worst fight ever both guys were garbage
probably the most boring champ fight i’ve seen in a while
&quot;As long as they didnt listen to the crowd i was fine&quot;
Yoel u asked for this loss u stood there for the first 2 minutes did nothing got your legs fucked up shouldve taken him down to the ground but u didn’t
Yoel: That’s what people want to see here.  He running, running and running.  The big champion stay here in the middle.  Like fight like a real champion.  Like old people in Rome.  Gladiators!<br>That’s what people want to see here! That’s what people want to see here! <br>People pay pay per view for real fight!  Not for THIS!...  People pay for fight not for running.  If you pay for running you go see Usain Bolt!
Israel walk in dancers would done a better fight lol
Romero needs to move to the light heavyweight many fights are good for him there : him vs thiago santos would be interesting
