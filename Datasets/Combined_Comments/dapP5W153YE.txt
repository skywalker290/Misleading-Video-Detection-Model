Does anyone feel bad for the pilot when he got thrown out the helicopterüò¢
Ah yes the trucks we need in forza horizon 5
No Trucks And Helicopters who were harmed in this film!
I love the buildup of the fear of them about to get lifted in the air to the sudden arrival of the brothers all tinkering with their controls to the beat of the music. Couldn&#39;t have created a &quot;the playing feel is levelled now Brixton, we&#39;re coming for you!!!&quot; vibe any better. Gets me pumped every time I hear &quot;we&#39;re coming uso!!!&quot;.
Jason Statham is awesome and he has lots of skills to defeat bad guys!

Oh I call BS! That blackhawk can lift 9,000lbs. It sure as hell would lift that car off the ground
bullshit
What if they accelerate the helicopter so that the vehicles lose strength and balance?
Wow, this scene has like ALL the bullshit. haha
I can&#39;t believe they did my man Optimus like that.
Is this a true story?

You could&#39;ve called Captain America. He will catch the helicopter with his bare hands
The pilot didn&#39;t listened to helikopter hard enough and didn&#39;t have enough para kofer power  so he lost. Classic.

To think Brixton could have just fired the chopper&#39;s weapons before the other trucks came in and blown Hobbs and Shaw up.<br><br>This is an F&amp;F movie,no one ever gets hurt by their own explosives.

Dwayne Johnson (hobbs): i need a distraction<br>Roman Reigns: Uh-Ah  (and give the villain the spear
This is literally one of the 3 only scenes in this movie that actually gives fast and furious vibes to it
This was exactly what I wanted to do as a kid
Haha...so genial
ÔºõÔºõÔΩåÔΩåÔΩã
Never has such garbage been put on film
I expected mom to show up last and attach car to the others.
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE!!!
This would actually be a great clip to analyze in a Physics class
Imagine that there was a room with moviewriters, brainstorming about this movie and someone came up with this scene and proposed it to the other writers
This is like the Gi Joe Comic only someone filmed it without the license.
Considering the fact that in reality several things will happen like the chain breaking, Blackhawks are not Chinooks they dont have that lifting power to pull 4/5 trucks, Hollywood juz love to use NOS as jet pack booster for vehicles. Still this scene is awesome......hahaha
And a friend of mine said that FF is realistic
Those are the all mighty truck and rescue trucks
I like the all mighty truck and rescue trucks
This is the easiest way to teach kids Toretto and Hobbs&#39; Law of Physics, show them this movie + the FF franchise.
Fun Fact: ur mom was in the car so it was too heavy to lift

no thanks
Just so we are clear, we all know that helicopter can lift that approx 6000 lbs of truck right?  Right?
There is no way a black hawk could do all this. If you are going to do these sort of stunts, at least use a helicopter that could probably do it. This reminds me of that harrier scene in True Lies.
In reality, had the helicopter been in attack mode, bye bye Hobbs and Shaw. Movies is magic.
A Blackhawk can lift about 9,000 pounds. All the weapons on that one are taking up a significant portion of that weight. Under ideal conditions, it might be able to get one end of one truck slightly off the ground. There&#39;s no possible way it would be able to lift several trucks at once.<br><br>Also, the &quot;hit &#39;em with the moonshine&quot; bit... just no. For one thing, if your tires already have limited traction, spinning them faster is going to do nothing but kick up dust. More speed means nothing if the traction isn&#39;t there. Second, two tires on the ground wouldn&#39;t be able to pull four trucks and a helicopter around that corner, even on pavement. All four trucks 100% would have gone over that cliff (assuming the helicopter could even lift them in the first place). Contrary to popular belief, nitrous is not magic.<br><br>I know I&#39;m being a buzzkill here, but it&#39;s pretty hard to suspend disbelief for scenes like this. I wish I could turn off my brain.

I&#39;m more than happy to ignore the particular masses and thrusts, as well as the fact that Brixton only seems to pull up harder when each truck is added. It makes for an enjoyable watch.<br><br>However... That part (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=170">2:50</a>) where Brixton tries to pull them off the edge... If there&#39;s too much weight for him to lift them up, what&#39;s pulling them off the road going to do, other than crash the heli? xD<br>(I guess <i>maybe</i> he wasn&#39;t trying to pull them off, but to disconnect the trucks, perhaps, or get one of the chain to panic and disconnect, but it&#39;s a huge risk given, if nothing else, they might not <i>be</i> able to disconnect the trucks! :P)
Helicopter could barely hold itself against one truck, then all the sudden it&#39;s lifting three?

Ppl really say you have low iq when watching movies emphasis on movies cause unless they are based off real events damn near every movie is fantasy, fiction, unrealistic like the villains is an enhanced super human lmaoo with a motorcycle that transforms and can come to him damn near anywhere and this is not supposed to be fast and furious type movie I‚Äôm pretty sure this is own type of action movie just with the fast and furious presentation ü§¶üèæ also the part where they went to Samoa wasn‚Äôt dumb it‚Äôs called strategy, the part about their weapons is actually smart and dumb cause for one your enemy can‚Äôt just pick it up and shot you but it can be hacked and you would be in a messed up situation it‚Äôs really how you perceive it honestly this movie was great to me and I didn‚Äôt know a lot of you don‚Äôt enjoy movies but instead just criticizes movies when a good 85% are not realistic and nothing more than fiction, fantasy etc. but hey it‚Äôs your opinion, it was great to meü§∑üèΩ

Screenwriter: And so Hobbs is going to grab a chain holding the bad guys in the helicopter in one hand and hold on to the truck in the other hand to prevent it from flying away. <br>Head of Studio of whom the screenwriter is presenting to: Oh that‚Äôs ludicrous!!<br>Screenwriter: No, it‚Äôs Dwayne Johnson. <br>Head of Studio: Never mind.

Name is movie
These feels like a hot wheels comercial xD<br><br><br><br><br>Also: that is a military modified chopper, a chopper that size could easy lift around 30,000 pounds, and that truck in the beginning is roughly 8,000 pounds, so that chopper should have taken off with no problem xD
its so over the top but i love it
Excellent stunt üî•üî•üî•üî•

That was horrible
I just realized that when shaw yells &quot;were gonna need nore weight&quot; the guy in the next truck is more heavyweight omg... idk if that was an intentional thing or not lol
I just don&#39;t get that he could left all the cars when they got attached to each other but couldn&#39;t left the first one all the way up. ü§î
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=125">2:05</a> this reminded me of the tow truck glitch me and my friends tried to do in GTA, every time we were launched into the air
That chain would&#39;ve snapped like a baby bird&#39;s bones

Hobbs<br>Shaw
Not Helicopter vs truck<br>Helicopter vs The rock
that is just stupid...<br>I mean - if that heli could have picked up 3 cars, it could easily pick up the very first one, instead of &quot;fihgting&quot; with it :V<br>Not to mention that is not how physics work ;__;
That helicopter was aimed directly at the truck why didnt it just open fire and end this horrible scene
wow super cheezy fake
Fentastic

full movies
I swear NOS is basically God&#39;s fuel in the FoF franchise giving hacked and 100% guaranteed wins no matter the situation
In reality, Hobbs and Shaw wud be hanging from the chopper midair while trying to climb up the chain which Brixton would cut and the rest of Hobb&#39;s fam would be stranded on the island with broken axles and bumpers
I love th rocks dad is wearing flip flops
Dumbest action scene ever; give me my 80s action heroes any day.

Say what you will about this scene not making sense but I believe the fast and furious franchise don‚Äôt make sense they make car films with lots of action and I think this delivers true
Lol, this movie was asinine.
That&#39;s like 16 tonnes of weight to be lifted by a 4 tonne helicopter engine<br><br>I dunno man. I dunno

So a mid sized helicopter can carry the weight of 3 trucks? So without load at full throttle it must be able to break the sound barrier vertically. Lets not forget about the technology behind the front wheels of the first truck, able to get traction on dirt with the weight of 4 trucks and full throttle helicopter as resistance.

Ok, you can complain all you like, but you KNOW this wouldn&#39;t be a &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; movie without a physics defying car chase featuring a load of crazy, tricked-out custom cars.
