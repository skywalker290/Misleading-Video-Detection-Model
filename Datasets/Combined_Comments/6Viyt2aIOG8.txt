Can&#39;t believe its already 8 years old😢, time is flying like crazy. Shes such a beauty that has a bold character and unique elegance, the new 2024 7 series doesn&#39;t even compare to this masterpiece. Miss the Old BMW❤
BMW absolutely needs to have this man as their spokesperson. He makes the car sound absolutely amazing, and his voice, demeanor, and presentation are incredible. He exudes professionalism and knowledge of the car as if he were the sole owner of the company. 👌
❤❤
the fact that this car is from 2015 its just blowing my mind🤯.
I had to comeback to this ,it&#39;s insane ❤
Watched this video when I was sleeping on the couch now I own one the 2019 model
Bmw sedan series 7 to nascar at alabama bmw the driving pleasure sheer
This was peak BMW
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23babydoge">#BabyDoge</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23minibnbtiger">#MiniBNBTiger</a> Take these two projects and build a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bmw">#BMW</a> factory. ❤
8 years till i saw this video and his presentation just mesmerizing. Best introduction i saw
Better than Apple announcements
crazy to think that this car came out 8 years ago
I love this heads up display. Why newer cars don&#39;t use it?
All you need to know is: GARBAGE!
Sell your house now and pre order this car!
How is this car 8 yrs old already… very timeless design
This 7 year old car still looks more sharp and futuristic than the present day cars
I like the house what is the country
YouTube recommended me after 7 years.
My favourite car 🚙 love 😍
I own this car, and I like it a lot, but I don&#39;t understand why BMW only has 6 ambient lighting colors while Benz has a color wheel where almost any color can be selected 🤔.
No doubt, This model year was the best!!!!!! <br>One of the most favorite VVIP protocol car in Bangladesh until it replaced by the new S class 😂😂
Wish thwy would go this deep into the engine cooling system.<br>&quot; this expansion tank is made from the cheapest plastic we could find ensuring you return to your service center often buying our bmw coolant not available at your local parts store.&quot;
nice
good
Fantastic <br>BMW 💝
👍👍👏
Any one here after the launch of the new ugly AF 7 series??
I can finally afford this next year.
Any car that put ads advertisements on the Super bowl is absolutely ultimate crappy machine. The good car should sell itself take a good look at Tesla
Please share the music details
What year is the BMW 7 series and model?
Perfect piece of machinery!
The best 7 series ever built, today&#39;s designers are in drugs
The old one definitely look way better
i&#39;m looking at the new 7 video n then i see this one... it&#39;s still so sleek n elegant ❤️
Watching this in 2022 ❤️
Nice explaination sir, I like the executive drive of this person explaination about the cars
My favourite cars are bmw 6Gt &amp; 7 series

I have to come back and watch this one, my favourite 7 series,  the new one is really nice too, but not so BMW.
What did the &quot;Moe eye poke&quot; gesture control again??
I think this generation was much better than the new one! Especially the exterior design. And the interior was a combination of classic and modern design, but now it nothing just many big screens!😕
This car aged well. It may wasn’t ahead of it’s time unlike other BMW’s but still looks good for 2015.
I have to translate the video so that people can understand better
This was the best generation
Here after seeing the new 7, this is more I like it, I feel at home now. BMW has lost it.
Who&#39;s watching after the new 7 series unveil
wow
I own a BMW 2017 750  I X drive M sdport and it is constantly in the shop as something keeps BREAKING  $123,000 CAR SUCKS . Betterr off with a Lexus LS   as they are amazing in dependibility
That Place is New Zeeland or Germany ?<br>I really Like The Landscape in this Video <br>And Of Course The Car 😄
the technology that bmw already had 6 years ago is insane
I have BMW 730li......<br>I need some information...<br>Need engine oil after 2k or 3k kilometer. Engine oil decreases with water normally?
I wanna buy this house
Anybody else back here in 2022?
It should have electronicall table
Bmw ❤️😍❤️
One day my dream will come true🥲
Mercedes S Class better
hmm yes a video of a bmw 7 series from<br>2015<br>time to &quot;recreate&quot; that 7 series in roblox<br>-me, 2021
Fun fact: The interior was done by Corsair
Mau nay rat dep . Dep hon nhung mau 2023  2024
If person can afford this easily afford s class and it&#39;s so better than this
Bmw 7 series is amazing
wowwwww
I hate Autonomous Driving<br>I would rather Driver Aiding or Assistance, I saw best driver aiding feature in BMW is the camera in dashboard to watch driver eyes are attending the road during driving aiding systems active.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Viyt2aIOG8&amp;t=273">4:33</a> “eight different fragrances”<br>That is upgrading from the 6 used to be
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Viyt2aIOG8&amp;t=71">1:11</a> “Starting and killing the engine..”<br>“Killing” what about “shutdown” or “turnoffs” or whatever other than “Killing”.
I believe BMW’s flagship is 8 Series, not 7 Series, as in early nineties.
The last great 7 series.
In Turkey, taxes for this car that you need to pay to the state are even higher than the price of the car itself.
A BMW is my dream.🤗❤💝
Great video to present 7series and presenter doing good job.
Wish I can afford this bad boy
I love bmw
What year I series is it?
I need this car❤️

I wish,  everyone can buy it
Greetings from Scotland! I have a late 2016 740d in Carbon Black. I haven&#39;t stopped smiling since the first day I drove it out of the dealership! A truly superbly designed happy machine! I get at least 42 mpg and I don&#39;t exactly drive slowly. A long motorway drive is no longer boring or uncomfortable. On more than one occasion it has activated the anti-collision systems to prevent a side swipe and stopped on a pin head when a pedestrian has walked in front at the last minute in town. At least one stray dog is still alive because of that excellent technology! To wrap it up, BMW have thought of just about everything, except a voice control for my wife&#39;s constant nagging about my driving, but nothing is perfect I suppose! 😂😂
Dream Car , Goal to be Acheived
This looks like something from today
Useless technology the narrow space parking. How am I supposed to get in and out of the car? I will hit the car next to me when trying to open the door. And even if I get out before getting in the narrow parking space the other cars owners will be unable to open their doors to get in / out
I know that this product presentation is from years ago, but I cannot deny that it is always very good to see it due to the dynamics of use.<br>I will always like
For those who can&#39;t afford a Rolls.
Great video as usual !! Pleasure to listen great voice and presentation!!! Simply superb
I got the 2022 BMW 730li yesterday lol. Trying to figure out how to put of child protection on the rear tablet.
Kenapa ganteng sekali sih kamu😭😭BMW mudah2an sya bisa beli..

who is that presenter?
I&#39;ve made a setup for shooting cars in 360º to create an interactive view, and I wanted to test the setup, so I shot our own BMW 740, and I linked this video here in parts to build up the explainers, again, this is just for testing and demonstration not for commercial purposes, here are the results: <a href="https://magicmedia.me/3d-product-views/bmw-demo/BMW-by-MagicMedia.html%C2%A0">https://magicmedia.me/3d-product-views/bmw-demo/BMW-by-MagicMedia.html </a><br>I hope you like it, enjoy :)
I&#39;m from France, i am thinking of buying bmw 750ld.🙋‍♂️🇨🇵👍

I hope one day purchase this car god help me😭😭😭
If one car is missing from the BMW luxury factory ...<br>It is a simple thing<br>But if you received it.<br>It is the best dream .. ever
Dream 😍😍♥️♥️🥺🥺
I dont wanna spoil this car by buying it
Blackstone motors feltham
Amazing
Which model year was that?
drive it easily , but  next life
go for Mercedes or Audi If you are from  India.... Bmw have very expensive services and parts are too expensive.. compare to audi or Mercedes
Mercedes Benz, BMW,Audi,Volkswagen are German cars
I like this German car
I have told the BMW to send me many of this cars 😒
Mg gloster gives this at 1/5th cost.... I somehow see these brands quickly catching up greatly improving on quality providing at dirt cheap prices.... lets see how German vehicles do
its  so  impressive cuz this was in 2015
I really want the instruments cluster as it is there in the new 5 series..  That&#39;s awesome..  <br>I don&#39;t like the round shaped cluster 😫😒
You are the best reviewer of BMW and the car was just mind blowing <br>What about BMW 7 series 2021?
The venue in combination with the car 😍
♥️
Monopoli money cash bank
Wow
My favorite &amp; lovely car BMW <br> Thank for your review 👍
I hate myself for not being able to afford this beauty.
2.2k people didn&#39;t get a loan for it 😂😂😂
Doctors love them!
no way this is 2015... bmw is so far advance it&#39;s not even funny
Surprise super
Great job!<br>This video is why I made the choice between the 5 and 7 series.  BMW needs to give you a starring role in all their upcoming videos and you need a higher pay rate as well!
which model?
Hi BMW! I really need help. My dealer in Russia stole my darkened mirror. And he doesn&#39;t want to give it back to me. The service gave me the usual one. Support for BMW Russia does not want to solve this issue. Please find out the truth. I can send you the vehicle&#39;s VIN code to check the configuration.
My dream 😔
Bangladesh is one of the biggest market of BMW. But here It&#39;s price is too much high. So that, Marcedese &amp; Audi is increasing on the market. Please BMW, reduce price of your can in Bangladesh. 🇧🇩
this guy is so good i wish i was him yes
i wish i can buy this
This video and this guy are slick! I love my 745e.

When BMW actually used to innovate and not just stick big grills to their cars.
One thing I don&#39;t get is why they bring the cool and new features to the sedans first then bring it to the X versions a few years later.

Hi bmw 🙋🙋 give me a car
BMW car quality surprisingly sucks !<br>The BMW dealer (stevens creek) is selling you defective car with brand new price !!!<br><br><br>I purchased a brand new 2020 X7 from this dealer.<br>And the car was broken after 7 days driving:<br>1. The touch screen is 100% off, I can not control anything on the display.<br>2. The bluetooth wipe out my and my wife&#39;s phone (Andriod and Iphone both) connection 3 time a week, which mean we need to reconnect/reconfigure our phone connection every other day.<br>3. The battery is dead permanently, the error signal was on when I purchased it originally, but the sales told me it will be back to normal after couple days driving. But after 1 week driving, the battery error signal is still there, and need to be replaced.<br>4. The rubber seal on the frontend hook is coming out, and looks really ugly and do not match the BMW brand at all.<br>5. The auto lock is not function at all. After enabling this feature, the auto lock still not working at all. This feature is very normal one on any premium brand car back to 5+ year ago.  I personally own another Acura and Tesla, all of cars have this function and there is no problems to use such function in the past 3 years.<br>6. All of the cellphone app remote control function is not working on my car. I can not lock/unlock/flash/horn the car via the phone app.<br><br>I drop off the car 5 calendar days (4 business) ago.<br>And service department is still working on it, from the time it took, I can definitely tell this is not a small issue. Since the service adviser told me, replacing a new battery will only cost them half business day.<br>So for sure, there is a huge defective on this brand new X7 car.<br><br>I am really surprised that this dealer will sell defective car to the customer, especially on such high end/premium 7 series product line.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Update @2020-06-24:<br>After 5 days waiting, today afternoon the service department just called me back, saying the display is totally off, and can not be fixed by them. So they decided to order a new display from BMW, and the new part will arrive on Friday(so another 3 business days waiting). And then they will need to replace the display part completely!<br>Can you imagine this is what happened to a brand NEW X7, with 7 days driving and only less than 200 mileage.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>update @2020-07-16<br>After 3 weeks of review, the BMW North America customer relationship department called me and said they made a decision and will do nothing regarding my defective X7. <br>I feel speechless and helpless. BMW is acting like a robber, who steals your $, with a defective product, and does nothing about the complaint. I do not see how BMW is caring about its customer. <br>Really disappointment, and I will seek to sue BMW North America.
Maybe I will afford this after 20 years
Just more 13 years  to buy this car really can&#39;t wait for it
Hey BMW 😊 i love your cars,can&#39;t wait for an electric series

I think it also comes in hybrid but do we have any clue if there is going to be a fully electric version?
Be back in a year! When I can afford it...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Viyt2aIOG8&amp;t=37">0:37</a><br>So much attention to detail. They made the key reflect the sun while the car rolled out of the garage.<br>They can sell me air with this kind of advertisement
Ugly 🤮
It is my love.... i realy want it, thanks for motivation, i love you bmw, you are really best...
I&#39;m 2 years from 16 hope it depreciates down in price so I can afford this lol

If I had a dollar for every time he said &quot; the all new 7 series&quot;..... cha ching!
50000 miles then its stuck in the shop
Absolutly amazing! Well done, BMW! :)
All you need to know is BMW post sale  in my country is shame for the brand!!<br>I have 7 series for 7 years.. Spent in official dealership for services and maintenance more than 25 000 $. <br>BMW never gave me replacement vehicle.  Never! Not even once!<br>Btw my car spent more than 700 days is service in that last 7 years.<br>Best thing: i asked BMW in my country how much would they give me for my perfectly maintened 7 Series BMW if i buy new BMW they said : nothing! We are not interested in taking your car into account.  Really depressing..<br>Never again BMW 7 Series!
How much is this car right now in the market??
Bmw is best in india car
And I’ll be back in 7 years. When I can finally afford it.

The BMW is good, but the presenter is a piece of shit! Why need a black presenter? German cars need a blonde echte GERMAN presenter ;)

Amazing how a high-end ad like this can&#39;t write English so the grammar is correct. It&#39;s about half-way through, and so far 3 pretty obvious errors. I&#39;d be embarrassed if I were a copywriter for BMW. I guess it could be the German to English translation. Maybe.
That&#39;s not all you need to know. Because you better have a big check book when that warranty expires! These are such beautiful cars. I only wish they were dependable.
That&#39;s not all you need to know.  You also need to know, you better have a big check book when that warranty expires!!  You&#39;ll also be customizing a special gesture when warranty runs out.  These are such beautiful cars, I only wish they were dependable.
Testicles sold! And organs!
One of my favorite brand.

Awesome car but why you guys messed with that classy grill ?

back when there was more Bmw than grille
Fuck this bmw. But man, gotta hand it to you. The review was flawless.
This guy is one slick presenter. Awaiting my 745e plug-in after two 640ds. Just wish they had updated the switchgear and dash with TFT screens ala Audi A8, then BMW would have delivered the full package on the seven.
I drive a bmw x1 car...the driving make me love bmw😍🔥

It will be worthless in five years.
Alright, I just checked out the 2020 BMW 7 series and I must say, I think this one, specifically this one in this review has some other cooler features than the 2020. <br>Also the front grills are much reasonable than the 2020 7 series only the headlights on the 2020 are dope!
Bmw legend, no argument!
Can anyone tell me the music played in the background  at start of the video
<i>high quality material beautiful  looking</i><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Don&#39;t forget the price man it&#39;s 180 grand
that interior is horrid omg...
Pimp shit.. I&#39;m buying one. I&#39;m already sick of my 535i
Looking at this in 2019 team bmw!

If you are not worth at least 1 million dollars, you should not buy this car, do not invest money on things that go down in value.

Chris Brow really is the best in introducing BMW vehicles... I been waiting on him to do an intro on the new 7 series though
Geborener verkäufer der Typ
Nice car but unfortunately BMW interiors are a bit boring and the hand gesture command doesn&#39;t quite work in reality, still after Mercedes it is still one of the best in the market...

Definition of luxury and excellence BMW 7 series

Iam getting a heart attack
Wow, the car i will never be able to own in million years
but its a too cheap

HE DOESN&#39;T MENTION ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH THAT BEAUTY.

Why I am watching this video
Product of extraordinary human brain 😘
My car
I have A Alto 800
Awesome look
These cars are becoming so much like land running spaceships day by day . too many features and equipment too much technology makes the feel of a car absent !!
Well how much people&#39;s can Bay this car, i think one percent only in all world.
it probably knows how to fly as well
Normally such cars are driven by drivers so now they need degree to use so much options
And what about horse power? Wheres the real info

So if you have executive read package it’s four seats right?

Very nice, but I hate how luxury car manufacturers trying to say us families only have 4 not 5 members
It&#39;s beautiful...it&#39;s just next to a Tesla Model S that drives itself. Tech seems to speak louder than leather pillows and carbon fiber.
Perfect car for rich peoples but not for poor peoples like us

I love this car! And I will own it someday. Love BMW !!
It&#39;s a bottomless money pit.
I love this car and am seriously considering it as a summer replacement for my Range Rover Velar. However, it’s shocking that basic safety features such as autonomous emergency braking has to be purchased in addition when most other European manufacturers offer it as the very minimum standard.
Almost the same as Audi A8 L
Wow. I want this car.
Hmmmm    does this car also catch on fire while parked!!!  Wonder who will buy them at that price to set their houses on fire.
I love this car 😘😍
Ambient air package damn haha
Bmw is awesome and the guy speaks so clear

Wow awesome.. I Wish To Buy BMW 7 Series.....
Can you tell me the model number of bmw 7 series
Omg those interior lights though. Makes my 3 series look like a gremlin 😱
Purchased one of these new 7.50xi M-sport. Spent over $100k for this car. Has been at the dealerships service department almost more time than it’s been with me!  One problem after another. From electronics that don’t work properly. To engine and break malfunctions. <br>The only thing good I can say about it is the service department at the dealership I bought it from really tries to address the problems. But the car itself in my opinion is horrible!!<br>I would never buy this car again!!! <br>Stay tuned as will be coming out with videos and blogs detailing my experiences with this car.
It looks dated now in comparison with the new X5
Puedo estar orgulloso por que tengo uno de ellos
where was this shot at, beautiful scenery.
That&#39;s why I want to be rich
Great salute to bmw engineers, designers and technologists

Dear Chris: Please meet few people who actually own BMW-7. You will know how many technical problems they are going through. How they are not getting any support/positive response from BMW, once the car is purchased. Can BMW dare to publish a video on how they are taking care of all the technical problems everyone is facing? Can they really help the suffering customers? Can they see the falling popularity of the car and their falling stock, even after 5 year warranty? In Singapore, the popular slogan is: If you want to hurt someone without getting legally stuck: Ask them to buy a BMW. The higher the model, the greater the revenge. I am a &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;PROUD&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; owner of 7 series and suffering for last one year, from the day of purchase of the car.
I can&#39;t wait the BMW to be cheap
Beautiful car and technology! And of course amazing people behind it. ❤
I want Emile and Im offering the show
Super and amazing technology of india
I hope that i have money , to get it ❤❤❤🙁🙁🙁
And I am here struggling to fix a blown head gasket for my 02 accord.  Let me get back to what I was doing.
I&#39;m so in love :&#39;(
can i has one for free plz
Light only a bit passed down and a bit tight and nothing new more and a technique that corrupts us and the car and us .Now people think when the new thing comes out and a hundred kilograms lighter than its predecessor, it would be better, everything goes wrong and as soon as parts are expensive Like Mercedes and AUDI
BMW+AUDI=❤🇩🇪
Bmw🇩🇪❤👏
وااااو حلوووووه
Luv those wheels
I have 10000000000000000 bmw
What a gorgeous car! Way better than Benz,Cadillac,Audi,Lexus has right now

No hojfg
Has the car got WiFi?
Music, Soundtrack PLEEEEEEAASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How much is the car
Favourite BMW by far.
Bmw is a best car and very popular and comfortable car
In the beginning I thought he was going to sign 😂😂
All I had to know... That I can&#39;t afford it
I am a sad owner of 740BMW(so called luxury car) for last one year. Have been struggling hard to get the features from BMW for which I had paid for. <br>Every advertisement/website of BMW shows that &quot;road speed&quot; is a standard feature of 7 series. BMW have sold me a 740 without this feature. <br>After struggling for one year, they are offering me free spa vouchers but no remedy for the missing feature. <br><br>Not only this, my keys have not been working properly, the data always gets lost, the key with display suddenly stops working and you cannot open/close your car. You are stuck on the road. They key takes long to charge and does not hold the charge. You have to keep on charging it every few days. <br><br>The heads on display is supposed to show &quot;low gas level&quot;. In my car it does not display and I got stuck in the middle of the road. <br><br>Can you believe it, how much I must be troubled that I traveled all the way to Germany from Singapore to make my complaint. It was with great efforts that I was given one form to fill in. This form carries no Serial number or complaint number. Nobody officially acknowledges it. I am still waiting for few months for a reply. I do not know whom to remind and whom to contact. <br><br>Their local dealer was happy to sell the car, collect the money-great smiles. Now no help for the grieved customer. <br><br>Logically the proof of the poor quality of the car and state of affairs with BMW comes by way of: <br>1. BMW is offering 5 year warranty to be able to sell the car.  <br>2. Declining consumer rating in US/elsewhere<br>3. BMW stock value for last two years. <br>4. BMW not able to offer a complaint number for complaints made even in their main office in Germany&gt; Scared customers will use it for follow up.<br>5. No e-mail address/phone numbers given to customers in case of such sufferings. <br><br>Trust me, my personal view is, you are lucky and blessed if you do no own BMW.  <br>After fighting/insisting for 11 months, I am offered to either return the car at less than half the cost(BMW agrees that their car does not even have 50% value after 11 months) or take TWO FREE Spa vouchers.<br>Friends, please think million times before buying the car.
One thing bmw has which mercedes and audi doesnt has that is<br>The display key😍😎
Wonderful
One day. .
Its ironic that im watching this on a galaxy tab 4
Still Cant beat Tesla.......

Strong, confident, precise review, thank you very much, the inside lightings and colors are just stunning
I purchased a new BMW in 2013 in Portugal that this 2017 /2018 winter put water in the suitcase and destroyed various electrical systems due to a defect in fence, besides having put in question my safety and my family.<br><br>The BMW dealer in Portugal, Caetano Retail of V.N.Gaia assumes no liability despite all the revisions being made religiously in the mark and the problem is notoriously a manufacturing defect.<br><br>I intend to solve the problem according to the premium service with which I have always been accustomed by BMW.
oh my god on of the ever best cars in the world- B..M.......W.......!!!!!!!.
Full of useless gimmicks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Viyt2aIOG8&amp;t=234">3:54</a> look at the leg room LOL

Why is he telling the milage i dont think any one buying this shit will care about it
Did i just saw him putting an iphone 4 on a wire less charging pad
wait years this car will depreciate in be 3000 dollars lol
S class is superior.
wow cooooollll
Next future feature is to drive your BMW to your favorite vacation spot without sitting in it so you don&#39;t get tired from traveling.
Gostei!
love it👌
I&#39;m nabeel ihsan I&#39;m indian   I&#39;m translate you&#39;re video  ?
The thing is...all of those features do not come with the car. Those are extras. So...you need to cough up another 50k to have EVERYTHING. Total price would be around $300k which is enough money to buy 3 classic Mustangs that turns peoples heads when you drive down the road. :-)
I fuckkkkkin hate that headlight design that BMW is using for all of its cars. What the fuck is this? All of your vehicles looks like a clone of the others.
Not better than mercedes
Gesture control is a nightmare if you&#39;re Italian.

I buy BMW 6series not this
We need a two door version of this
We can all like and admire things we will never have Wat harm is there in lickeing it&#39;s a pity more people can&#39;t learn that to be happy to just like is to be contented😊

very nice
This is how you advertise a car. Mercedes did too damn much trying to hard to high class and boring. The ad for the S class was solely based on aesthetics(atleast the one I saw)
This guy is one n away from hitting Rihanna
Is Chris Canadian? He&#39;s very articulate and doesn&#39;t have that annoy American tone.
I like that place more than the car!
OK fine cars I will buy two BMW cars😊

Poop.

Is this a Sci-Fi movie ?
I really don&#39;t think it should count as &quot;Luxury&quot;.  shit looks like an Uber
Have you ever thought of what country are they advertising at?
<b>EXECUTIVE LOUNGE</b> = the back seats<br><b>SKY LOUNGE</b> = tiny little color changing lights in a black glass panel that could&#39;ve been a back seat moon roof<br><b>EXECUTIVE DRIVE PRO</b> = good suspension
where are the nature scenes filmed?
When I got rich I buy this car &lt;3 BMW and Merc 4tw!
How many years do i need to get one !! God
How about the cost. I need to know the cost.
Well if you think of the guy as a professional sales person then you realize that you don&#39;t need some of those features. Well at least I don&#39;t cause I know how to park a car in my own garage. Or ambient lighting who needs that shit. I call it over engineered.
Germans stole money from the whole Europe and now all people admire them.

Tbh all I want out of a car is comfort, some good acceleration, the best infotainment integration, ease of use, style and affordability. Somewhere along the line these German and other brands lost sight of what they&#39;re doing. You deliberately cripple the entry level to sell your 70K cars. Then get massively overtaken by the likes of Peugeot and their new 5008, 3008 line-up with far better value for money and comparable features to your top range included. Please... Remember your customers and what you&#39;re selling. Give us the best car you can make at something like 20-30 grand and make all but the most ridiculous of options included or cheap (especially infotainment). It&#39;s sad to see so much potential of BMW and Mercedes, etc go to waste because they want to brand themselves as &quot;exclusive&quot; and up their prices for the sake of giving people a reason to buy the top level cars. Regular people can&#39;t afford even the 3-series.
A Ferocious BMW Car
So much technology and you&#39;re still a egg head... LOL
Doesn’t beat the new Audi A8L
Complete crap. &quot;Ambient light package&quot;, so basically you pay a shit load of extra money on top of that garbage to get 8 more led colors. the tablets in the back are useless. When he talks to the car they never showed what was the response, I could have said We have to go back Marty and say we are going back to the future. &quot;Executive lounge&quot; - the back seats of the freaking car ffs. This shit really pisses me off.
hi u have bmw 7 series.and i biggest fan of u .
https://youtu.be/bHE9oeXXM6U
cool
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMM
The BMW is great. But the black dude kinda cheapens the look. They should have a blue eyed blond German man in his early 40s with a mild accent foreign of course
U can&#39;t beat tesla
too much
That steering wheel is so outdated looking. It could be in a 2007 bmw. Steering wheel is a very important thing to me :/
Fuck yuuuu

I have been a lover of cars especially BMW. I drove one of the oldest versions back home for just a day. Most often, I am hitting the streets corners in Taichung City, Taiwan watching these Taiwanese flipping on this 7 series. I am like wow but it&#39;s likely not impossible to own one at a later time or purchasing a customized version with a system satellite for sport TV, internet for all location, oven and refrigerator which is possible. This might scare you which makes it a dream!
i was late for work today,
là seul chose qui me plait pas da cette voiture c&#39;est que c&#39;est pas à moi
It&#39;s a shame that they can&#39;t even pronounce their company name...

God i hate being poor......😭
Has science gone too far
ohhh my heart {}
Everything perfect but one thing that really stressed me when he slammed that door ... how can you talk about the flagship of luxury without using a softclose door  model... that honestly killed the whole vibe of the video for me
can someone pls tell me which is that place or spot ???

What&#39;s the price
I’ll stick with a Maybach
It is same but improvement
But we have one but it has cup holders and mini bar
It ain&#39;t a Tesla though.
I invented a bmw 315i
Am I the only one annoyed by how the &quot;raise&quot; and &quot;lower the volume&quot; screens are opposed to what raise and lower mean?
Now tell me how much all these options cost
Work hard and get one.
How many times he said &quot;the new bmw 7 series&quot;?!
Now that is what im talking about, being driven in a beautiful Car.

Outstanding BMW 7 series

The dislike is from Mercedes-Benz but BMW better than Mercedes-Benz
every time I see this man in bmw ads, I remember Obama :)
BMW All you need to know: it will break in 3 years. Lease it but never buy

Sick! 🔥
so niceeee i hope one day i buy it
I have the bmw 7 series its amazing.
I just came twice
nice! but no money dude
the bmw serie 7 is quite good but i rather like the serie 5 535i 😍
it&#39;s a felony, truly.
Just awesome car love it
those back seat tv screens have to be detachable. it looks like they&#39;re just dangling down with very little support. seems to me they&#39;re velcro strapped.
Kobe 👌
I will one day
wow Wonderfull I will bring this bmw realy.<br>.
Mercedes s class is better,Better luxury, better interior, but it&#39;s my opinion
Someday, I&#39;ll be able to buy this, with enough hard work and positivity. Someday.
always the best BMW.....🤘🤘🤘
for how much u said...?
Its high time bmw changed models.  Look at Mercedes.
Only issue is height.
I love this car
a person who can afford this car will surely hire a driver as he cannot waste his time driving and all these features you are paying is only for your driver to enjoy.:)
Will it blow up just like other BMW&#39;s?
but i dont speak english....how the earth is going to talk to me!?
Shut up and take my money <br>Wait I don&#39;t have that much money
Nah .S class all the way..
i brought this car it awesome
Imagine dropping the smart screened key and shattering it !
Next Transporter movie&#39;s car?
I wish I can Buy One BMW 7 Series !!
why does this car have chrome hockey sticks on the side of it?
Tesla model S is better
hopefully in 10 years this car is worth 5k and all technology and touch screens still work
can the middle finger gesture say fuck you?
Is this shot in New Zealand?
why is kobe bryant advertising this
As a proud owner of an E65 7 Series, I must say the new iDrive system is the worst car system ever. That&#39;s why I brought a Mercedes. I still use my 7 series today, because of high depreciation and it wouldn&#39;t be worth it to sell, even though I have low mileage (67k km for a 14 year old car) Im thinking about buying an S class simply because it is cheaper, depreciates less, has more attention to comfort, and doesn&#39;t have the stupid iDrive system. My new GLE has a very easy to use system, compared to the X5 or my friend&#39;s new 7 Series.<br>Oh yes, I&#39;m thinking about buying a 4 series BMW. But I already have too many cars.
ever best features BMW 7 series.
what?! I regret buying Mercedes
Although I just bought a Volvo s90 , I would soon go for this champ.. this is the king.
hands down, best car I ever seen 😍
i don&#39;t know why i watch this everyday
is this the 2016 model
Diese Auto und diese Marke ist einfach mega Geil und das einzige und ware, das beste !!
What is the name of the songs that are used in this video?
can i buy one without the tv attached to the front seats? i hate them..
Why am I watching this! I am 20 years old kid who still don&#39;t have any plans  but  watching these 🐸😭 Need to do something big
Someone please tell me the &quot;year&quot; of this BMW 7series
I have 730li

Ldg
The HUD and the table in the lounge is very reminiscent of early BMW promotional films reminding the customer of their airplane manufacturer heritage !!
you&#39;d think they&#39;d have automatic opening and closing doors at this level
very good fecares
This car doesn&#39;t look respectable. it looks like cheap ipad. My next car will be something more serious than car for kids.
😍😍😍😍
Mercedes S Class &gt; BMW 7 series
In a word of smartphones and VR, excuse me that I am not impressed by the touch command tablet or gesture control for handling phone calls.
I love BMW, but they really need to do something different with their interior, they&#39;ve had the same style since I think 10+ years ago.
Yes
Fuck Benz
What a load of useless unnessesary features
What&#39;s the model displayed in the Video?<br><br>BMW 7 series is My dream car, not sure if I can ever afford for this but it&#39;s My Ultimate goal. I&#39;m an Engineer by Profession, I wanna see where My skills will lead Me from a Hyundai Sonata to BMW 7 series... :)
You know you spent too much money when your car has a &quot;luxury lounge&quot; in the back.

its time to face facts BMW ISNT building great cars anymore.   Im still waiting on a better car than the 2000 e38 and this new fancy G platform isn&#39;t it .

No one does a better review than this guy. He takes a car of 10/10 to beyond the rating scale!
hiI&#39;m sorry, one more question, Who knows the background track of friends Whose is this clip?Please if anyone knows the song and composer who is or downloaded link. Thanks
I had a 2006 BMW 330i that I loved but after 100,000 miles it was costing t9o much to maintain. I just started working for a BMW dealership and wish I could afford to buy another 330. It was an amazing car!
I am going to buy this lovely car in some months!!!!!!!!!
Soooooo...does somebody have 200k for me so I can afford the 760Li version with all kinds of shit?
Also curious what the exterior color of the car is (most prominent at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Viyt2aIOG8&amp;t=330">5:30</a>). It was asked prior but didn&#39;t see an answer. Awesome car!
which variant is it?
i love BMW car
what is the exterior color showcased in the video? Sophisto Grey or Arctic Grey?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Viyt2aIOG8&amp;t=165">2:45</a> a Nexus 5!
BMW is the is beat
PSSST!!!! BMW, I work for you. Can I get like a 60% discount on a 7Series!? Joking (kinda).
I&#39;m going to by this car when I&#39;m older maybe a better version of this :) WELL DONE BMW
Really you just drove 200 miles in your new BMW seven series but you&#39;re just too lazy to park your car in the garage !!  It&#39;s time to sell the house what do I need to ask for when I can sit in the backseat of my car and do paperwork and use my tablet !!!! Ahh ahhh where is the masturbator assistant at ??? It&#39;s pretty sad when you need to have your car parked itself in the garage because you&#39;re too lazy not get your fat ass in that car and park it in the goddamn garage lazy bastard
what the name of the reporter ???
Sorry I dont speak spanish
good
what a breathtakingly beautiful machine.<br>Here&#39;s hoping my E32 750il lives long enough to see the day of one of these resting next to her in the future. Maybe like 40 years in the future when I can finally, hopefully, afford one.<br><br>in the meantime, the E32 will have to work a little longer and I have to bleed myself dry to keep that V12 content.
This car is just like a trophy...work hard to get it
i want it baby
Have a 750 d
I&#39;d rather have an E30 M3 though.
blah blah blah blah beautiful now give in take a few ks and would be the same as the rest bring my wallet BMW
no words on BMWs new stupid 5 s<br>and 7 series
its very good
its very good
I was looking at the 7 series as a potential daily driver in the future but the problem is in my experience, BMWs seem to have a very short shelf life. I bought a newer generation second hand M trim 3 series about 11 months ago. It has caused me nothing but problems - after a £500 NOX sensor, 2 full plugs &amp; coil replacements, fuel injector replacements, many diagnostics and catalytic converter regeneration... I&#39;ve now got more catalytic converter problems, unknown cylinder misfires, water pump issues <b>and</b> potentially 4 fuel injector faults. If this is on a 2009 BMW, I can&#39;t imagine what problems a car with so much more technology such as the BMW 7 series will have. I love BMW as a brand but I think the service costs are just ridiculous past warranty and it&#39;s why I&#39;d have my doubts purchasing this.
interesting car, can i have more details in private BMW ?
the car nice, i like it
i have this car
alexandro745/ali can
I rented one, had it for 3 weeks in Germany. It was brand new and fell more in love with it every day.
Too much things in a car
Do these ones have turn signals?
It is not good. You can buy model s .
Never understood why someone would want to get a driver when they have a car like this, a bentley mulsanne, rolls royce or a maybach. Where&#39;s the fun in that. The best experience is when you drive the car yourself. If you don&#39;t want people to see you just tint the windows upfront
is that a car? i rather stay with my old e36...
i seen one in traffic this morning...i cursed the driver out just for driving it
Poor people be like &quot; I can&#39;t wait till 2047 to have these options on my car&quot;
My dream car
çok iyi vidiyo
This luxury car looks great! But in the future BMW can make a M7?
Thank You very much for this BMW 7 series presentation video. When I hear that You can speak with your car. I remember the Famous Tv series Knight Rider.
Why no space in the middle? It can&#39;t take 5 people, shit.
Noooow, if I could have money to afford it...
My dream car
25 years from now it will be affordable. i cant wait
Yay, it has an iPad! <br>Wait, is not an iPad, is a &quot;Samthing&quot; else.  Peasants!
And BMW is the best BMW ever I love BMW they are amazing
thanks chris brown.
how the fuck many times did he said &quot;ALL NEW BMW&quot;!!
How about the turn signal gesture?
Can&#39;t wait to get mine 760M
It&#39;s a great car, won&#39;t deny that, but so many of these features are expensive relatively useless gimmicks. Underwater basket weaving.
BMW 7 is well designed and customized for the new high tech generation.
its actually nor that expensive 60 grand
now all it needs is wifi
Very beautiful car ! The new design is amazing and so perfect. The quality looks awesome !
Any BMW with 70k miles is the bottomless money pit. BMW 550ii needs a update valve cover .I told Auto cars.North Brook,IL NO.I dont want to spend the money.He wouldn&#39;t do the valve leak unless,i have get the update  valve cover.  2  valve cover $2000,Update hose $200.2 Sensor $900.Later BMW Dealer ,you dont need the update valve cover.I ask Steve.if its time to rid of the car. Steve say , valve cover leak are very common.Not too worry.I have oil leak ,when it fix,then coolant leak.then back to oil leak then coolant leak.Its went back and forth for 3 years.Every time ,when i drop off the car ,I need to take another car.I made 15 to 20 trip .Think about much time and gas you spend.My cat sat in park lot for 4  month.Repair list.2 valve cover ,water pump . All new hose .New oil pan gasket , Alternator bracket gasket . New  Battery .,New radiator .Battery ground cable .New alternator .Front timing cover ,New radiator.New spark plugs hole.Every oil/ coolant hose  was replace.
Que carro foda veio 😍💘
Hey we are also bought  a BMW 740le in Sri Lanka and we won the travel for Germany BMW factory. If you can ask Sri Lankan dealer for give 4 passes for enter the factory.Thank you
Kinda looks like the interior of an Audi A6
BMW needs a new writer. Sounds like a 6th grader trying to fill an essay with fluff.<br><br>&quot;Just sitting here in the driving seat lets you realize the car&#39;s driving qualities will be outstanding both in dynamics and comfort&quot; LOL
soooo it can park in a perfectly clean and level garage with no small obstacles?<br><br>I&#39;m wondering, would anyone actually use this feature if you ever got this car? Or would you finally remember this feature after the warranty only to find out it doesn&#39;t work.
25 years from now it will be affordable. i cant wait
send me one for free please :( :( :(
I have Mercedes Benz 2017
I&#39;ll never go for a BMW in Sri Lanka as the local dealer Prestige is not doing a proper job. What ever the bmer they will ruin it. Let see in another country.
This is gangster as fuck and as soon as I&#39;m rich I&#39;m getting one and a driver.
Owsum Car I like IT ..
If I had this car, I wouldn&#39;t need to own a home anymore.
It is a good car in India but Lamborghini aventador&#39;s body is fully made of carbon fibre
how it cost
Oh look, another car ill never have.
I just bought an a4 which I&#39;ll keep for three years. Next is this one. Future of cars looks exciting
This is BMW that only few people can buy ;)
what is the price in india
CONGRATULATION TO BMW YOU MADE PERFECTION
LOVELY
what a car. as much as I love BMW I would still buy S class mercedes. what ruined this car is too much electronics. can you imagine running this car after 5 or 8 years? it&#39;s a money pit
it is much better than Ferrari
Good suits
Realmente um belo carro, esse més estarei adquirindo o meu no modelo sport.
been working on bmw  for 20 years if not mantenace correctly cars will cost you dearly. pre owned can be your worst nightmare if car miles is over a 100 k .

This is State of the Art 😆☺
Until they see the Mercedes s550....
Cough... M7... COUGH
Impressed by this video! The best video I&#39;ve seen in a car commercial. Good job BMW on making this video and it makes me want to buy it one day when I do earn enough. The detail showed for the car can only be described in &quot;very complete detailed on all feature&quot; making this video a real &quot;all we need to know&quot;. Keep making a video like this for the signature BMW 7 series.
What kind of house is that?
Does the display key have any lag in its animations and controls?
If you can&#39;t park your car,  you shouldn&#39;t be driving!!!!
cheese and butter,   eyes on you when your driving those things... I WANT NORMAL, TO MANY EYES ON MEE--- SELLING BM FOR &quot;KIA&quot;
S CLASS &gt; 7 SERIES
If anyone&#39;s wondering it&#39;s Lake Wakatipu in New Zealand.
Why BMW is not making the M7
Imagine the depreciation of this bmw in the next 10 years. Id love to get my hands on one of these lol.
this one i want for christmas
Great review!
german engineers and designers - I salute you!
