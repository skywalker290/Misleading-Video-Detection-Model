Flop series
Goosebumps❤
OK where the 2nd part ??
The 2004 composition is seems like it had been composed in recently year<br>Power of rehman&#39;s sir music❤️👍
One of the most underrated series 😟
⚡⚡Magic of Rehman sir.....and brilliant acting performances ...this web series &quot;Tandav&quot;  is so underrated ⚡⚡
🌱⛎♈🅰
On adapting the song, Rahman stated &quot;Abbas Ali called me and said the song was the centre of the whole series. So I said why don’t we tweak the lyrics because they were written for something else. So we got together with the lyricist Mehboob Alam and he wrote an extra antara. Now we have a new intro for the song. We were careful about not changing too much of the original. You get a certain magic in the mix of things. This song has aggression, a sense of melody and harmony.&quot;
Sunil is awesome 😍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_GOpW7dAsg&amp;t=98">1:38</a> 💥💥💥💥
A R Rahman recreate his composition for this webseries.....because no one has potential to do this for A R rahman music......love u sir....
I am speaking out of context, but this song is incomplete without Surya / Micheal vasanth

15 yr old me and 32 yr old me still have the same level of josh after listening to this
This proves yuva was way ahead times...yuvaa movie won&#39;t get  appreciation back when it is needed
Sarkar ek web series se dar jati hai😂 Itni kamzor neev hai sarkar ki
Tamil people be like I am your headmaster on the school you studied
Remembering my school days. The movie yuva was ahead of its time. Ar rahaman worked with mani ratnam multiple times in his career. Dil se, yuva. Yuva was released both in tamil and hindi version with different actors at the same day.
This song was a tribute to George reddy. !!
Like it 👍
Abhishek Bachchan and Ajay Devgan coming in our minds
That&#39;s exactly what magic is... you take a song 15 years old, make no change apart from lyrics, yet it sounds fresh. I bet it still will many years from now
What an amazing series it was.. Loved it
Bhagat Singh ne kaha pado lekin koi collar pakde toh use maar maar ke dho dalo
Yuva(2004)----Tandav<br>Om puri----Saif<br>Ajay Devgan----Zeeshan<br>Abhishek B---- Sunil Grover<br>No wonder tandav wasn&#39;t appreciated when you straight copy a movie
Man, this catches faster than covid
This could have been a revolutionary communist show but it went on to become a Bollywood-esque shitshow.
The King composer...❤️

One of the best webseries I thought Ali Abbas did hard work on it all gave justice to their characters saif ali khan and all . It  gave to feel like rajniti movie both are very different but all roles are very excellent
O....yuva yuva.... o yuva
Behtariin music 🎶
Original remix
It’s a remake song again
Wtf
Welcome back sunil Grover
Rahmans music is always ahead of its time. He has proved this numerous times.
Can anyone provide full version of &quot; dil mein mere tum hi tum ho &quot;.. the song played at very beginning of tandav ep 1 ( gurpal listening while driving)
Op saif
Remake aise karte hai Tseries walo. Seekho kuch 😏
From original jana gana mana Tamil song to Dhaka laga bukka bollywood song (Film name : yuva (2005) ) to Amazon prime web series &quot;Tandaav&quot; (2020) ....<br><br>Might be come same song in more remake/remix in next 10 yrs ?? 😂😂😂<br><br>Really amazing journey of this song ❤️❤️❤️
Dil mein mere tum hi tum ho Bhai ah song kah full name batana please Bhai

Seemed that this Dhakka Laga Bukka is made according to Salman Khan Version ! If you know what I mean ;)
You watch such student politicians rise on screen and it gives you all goosebumps, but when such leader rises in reality you call them with different names, criticize.
The music feels so fresh and crisp. Does not feel like it is almost two decade old track . Kudos to the editor. Also hats off to the idea of reusing this song.  Awesome work 👍
yes, I am Amit gupta and I am a political analyst and leader but I want to remain a leader but do not want to become a minister because I have to write the future for all...
I am a wounded lion
BJP ki chaddi kholne waali web series hain yeh 😂😂....I loved it ❤️❤️
What is the meaning of dhakka laga bukka
The people praising Rahman sir is the same people who degraded him for the remake if mazzakali .. 😂😂
Even after 16 years ARR Music Feels next generation album.. That&#39;s AR power 😍❤️
The soul of the song is the Bass guitar and I am glad that they didn&#39;t avoided it in the remake.
I love the series 😍
Jab jab  RAVAN ayega yuva me RAM Samega❤️❤️spirit of India

Till now not even a SINGLE film, web series or serial is made on Muhammad but if someone does and depicts his life inappropriately or disrespectfully would muslims still not protest and demand action...but hindu faith has constantly been stabbed casually just because we were tolerant. Atleast we are following legal means even after repetitive disdain and not beheading someone.
AMAZON ANTI HINDU, HATE HINDU PEASE BOYCOT IT AND HE IS JIHADI COMPANY ISLAMIK COMPANY

Nobody: <br>Tamilians who heard the original version of this song 2 decades ago be like: WTF😂
Great sir ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Kindly note this song too is been composed again by A R Rahman and re-written by Mehboob.. Same team but new lyrics
New lyrics seem forced rather than fitting in well with the rhythm.
It&#39;s disgusting that AR Rahman song is being used by tukde tukde gang who are mocking our (Nepalese) supreme Lord Pashupati Nath in this lousy web series called Tandav. I would like to pee on the team of Tandav. आक थू !💩💩💩💩
But where is that whistling part?

Boykott hinduphobic bollywood support south.
Every single actor did true justice to their roles. Fantastic movie, an eye opener for today&#39;s YUVA.
Another good music after Scam music
Ayub is a great actor. Khan&#39;s best villainy happened under Bharadwaj&#39;s orchestration. I don&#39;t get it right away here. Glad to see him play bold roles.
Saif ki mkbd
Saif Ali Khan is great actor.
Reminds me it’s been sooo many years of YUVA

What a remake man! This is what you really call a youth anthem. Even better than the original one from yuva movie.
Music = A R
Spoiler: Saif Ali Khan didn&#39;t become prime minister!!
Mullo ka series he
The suicide of the girl in last was unexpected for me 😟😟
Now can anyone compare this with France making cartoon of their faith and their response.<br>Our way of response to these nonsense is the cause because they Insult us again and again.<br>They are shameless minority, they don&#39;t respect others faith and<br>We are boneless majority, can&#39;t come together for the respect of our own faith.
Sadak par jis din aa gayen us din desh se nikal diye jaoge tum😺

Aega to modi hi
I would rather call it &quot;reuse&quot; with some addition, instead of remake. Because the track was already ahead of its time.
Kanhaiya Kumar : Zeeshan Ayub <br>Shaila Rashid : Kritika Kamra<br><br>Dimple Kapadia : Sonia Gandhi <br>Raghu Kishore : Rahul Gandhi<br><br>SAIF ALI KHAN : Hum sab banna chahte hai par bante kabhi nahin 😂
When the orginal is remixed with same Great Music Director AR !!!! U get the BEST!!!!
Came here for only Rahman
Fake narrative banned this movie
Fantastic recreation and sounding of the original. Simply the AR magic!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dPHd7xcxFc">https://youtu.be/8dPHd7xcxFc</a>
This Song is in Tamil ( Movie name - Ayutha Eluthu,  Song name - Jana gana)
This series is superb and this song is also awesome, Shiva reminds me of ex JNU president kanhaiya kumar he is gem  and he can contribute alot in development of our nation and to the Indian  politics , kanhaiya kumar deserves a chance.
what india needs
Ajay Devgan walking aggresively reminds me everytime I listen to this song....YUVA Movie❤️
Watching this I just remembered yuva movie, that&#39;s was great

It&#39;s a Biopic of Kanahiya Kumar 😂.. only This Music is Very good but webseries is not Good ..
Disappointing 😑
That&#39;s the magic is only created again by his Master A.R. Rahman<br>❤❤❤
👍👍👍👌👌👌💯💯💯
Cast ho to esi ❤️
Masterpiece ❤️...I saw the whole series
This song was released in 2003..and the music, arrangement, etc. is still relevant in 2021..thats how futuristic A R Rahman has always been..👏
Kids listening to this song first time right now<br>Legends know it since 2004
This is exactly what the movie &quot;Yuva&quot; was about. So glad the song and the movie&#39;s essence are being defined fabulously here.
Original by mani was better
Kuch aisa hi revolution Bharat me Ana chahiye studento ke thru tb Naya Bharat ka Janam hoga jai Hind
What a desperate fucking attempt to create some sympathy for tukde tukde gang
The only good thing about Tandav is this 16 year old masterpiece from the Mozart of Madras.

Reminded me of old Yuva !! Rehman Bhai  ko Salaam !
This will be flop.. Amazon making series with left mind set.. Note it

Only thing worth watching is Sunil Grover. Otherwise all people in this movie are Anti CAA, anti hindu.
mulla director<br> Therefore, anti hindu, anti India propaganda guaranteed.
Arr😘😘😘
Amazing Super Fantastic
This song is just awesome<br>If you guys don’t mind I recommend the Tamil version of this song which is the original song it’s called Jana Gana Mana from Ayutha Ezhuthu
Now this is a proper remix we need more songs like this
Bhakt movie dekhte time burnol leke baith na.!!!

Thank God for not messing with this classic song

JNU IN MOVIES: We salut bhagat singh.<br><br>JNU IN REAL: AFZAL HUM SHARMINDA HAI TUMARA KATHIL ABHI ZINDA HAI.🤣🤣<br><br>Bollywood is MANUPULATORWOOD.
Saif Ali khan ❤️❤️
Would anyone believe that this is a composition from 2004? Time has flown (almost 17 years!), but Rahman&#39;s music will always be relevant.
Rahman ji 👍 😘😘😘😘
I think the story is slightly related to JNU prob

So many STARS 🤩. LOVE THE GURU AR RAHMAN
Sunil Grover is like water, he can be any character , true actor, industry should treat him as an actor rather than comedian, he is an actor who can be anyone as script demands.<br><br>Happy to see him in serious role.
Here for ARR&#39;s magical music.
Today&#39;s kid wont understand wat music is ..they are happy with tanishk bhagchi songs.
omg saif ali khan is stunning 😍😍😍
This is perfectly adapted and very beautifully executed..Rahman and Mani sir should feel proud of this..they did this 16 years ago and still sounds so good with new lyrics
A.R. Rahman Sir....❤
It recalls.  Tamil movie:Ayutha Eluthu Suriya fans and Jana gana Mana song fans!!
looks promising ✊🏼
Saif comes back best suited n  dialogue delivery  boss for this kind of role zeeshan ayub good actor learn from Khans
Song, Saif, Sunil Grover, Mohd Zeeshan...... everything perfect in place ♥️♥️
A political show requires mature audience
This is how you do remakes ❤️
Rehman made such music when we we were kids...no wonder now his music goes over common audience&#39;s heads😂😂🙏🙏🙏 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23legend">#legend</a>
Kanhaiya Kumar
Seekho kuch ! Aisa hota hai remix bc
People are so in this music that they forgot to like the song😍power of AR Rahman
Another old hit screwed
Awesome .. can’t wait for this
Instant goosebumps...
Movies ho ya OTT. Purane gaano ki maa chodna nahi band karenge ye aalsi haramkhor
Dino Morea Back To Back 🔥🔥🔥
Hats off A R Rahman sir!
Sunil groover rocks
This is Tamil movie remake
ARR Vera level da
I will definitely watch it for sunil grover...
Yesterday I was listening to this song, and it here refreshed again.👍🏼
Another left propaganda 😂
Another good try by Communists to incite a riot and come out on the roads for anarchy in the name of &quot;bro democracy brooooo&quot;. Even the cast is a famous leftist islamist and the other cast is a guy who has named his son after one of the most brutal man to have been a genocidal against Hindus, but people don&#39;t see these easily identifiable propaganda for some reason.
Goosebumps 😯😯

AR RAHMAN&#39;S OLD SONGS TILL DATE CAN GIVE A RUN FOR TODAYS    NEW MUSIC COMPOSERS. THESE ARE JUST EVERGREEN.
Remake Nonsense 😡
Still fresh, A R Rahman for life and beyond. ❤
Koi is comment me btado kitne cast hai total bcz mene deno mariyo ko bhi dekha😜😜😜
A R Rehman magic never finish.
Any&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;School and College&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;students here 👍🙏
Kon kon Apni Maa ❤️ ki respect krta hai vo Like kare 👍👍❤️
ZEESHAN AYYUB ROCKS!!
AR RAHMAN SIR!!
this song is still so fresh
Ar rahman❤😍legend..all actor&#39;s❤😍 n actress&#39;s ❤😍all my fav
Surya&#39;s ayutha eluthu movie song n da same exact scenes... wud dis be a remake of it??? Hope not to be
AR Rahman
this song incites violence
15 yrs old Tamil movie Ayutha Eazhuthu remake... A product of Mani Rathnam
Rahmannnnnnn wowoowowowow🎉
Felt the song without lossing its original essence...Only A.R.Rrhman Sir&#39;s magic😘😍😍
Thanks for not f*cking up the old classic..
Yuva movie song.....
This song is taken from &quot;ayutha ezluthuthu&quot; ( three dots) . Ar music
Another propaganda in the name of Shree Ram to break India!
Krtitka kamra
Zeeshan and saif ali khan❤️🔥
A.R.Rahman 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The song is still so catchy and perfectly captures mood
I am glad that Amazon decided to use this song in 2021, Its timeless! Compare this with today&#39;s music and you would understand what garbage is being fed to us now. We downgraded from AR Rahman, Shankar, Ehsaan &amp; Loy, Vishal &amp; Shekhar to the likes of Badshah, Tony Kakkar and Tanishk Baghchi!
What a coincidence!!!!! yashraj mukhate has composed a similar one before
why rahman sir is a living legend!!!!
Solid
Fake views😂
Damn nostalgic. Yuva was such an epic movie.
A song made by Rehman in early 2000s is being reused 20yrs later...represents the timelessness of his fabulous music
Best line -Jab jab ravan aayega <br>Har yuva me  raam samayega ❤️💥💥✏️
Yuva came on 2004 and it&#39;s been 16 years of this masterpiece album.ARR is so ahead of his time that this song is still getting addictive to listen in repeat mode and refreshing..goat..❤️❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ufff 🔥
Ooo YUVA .... YUVAAH.......❤A R R A H M A N❤✊✊
Suni grover....man....how beautifully has he transformed everything about him for this character. Body language and those eyes !!.....if we remember dhippadh from patakha. Hands down man......killin it he is...
I hope this full song is there in the series
Good but Aarambh hai prachand still remains best.😏
That&#39;s kannadiga nakul abhayankar 😍
Stop using old tracks and create something different.
I love these song from yuva
This is what we call a genuine remake
Youth anthem🔥🔥🔥🔥
JNU students watching this - hamare aise sapne......barbaad kar diye shah😂
Zeeshan great actor
Seems like OTTs are not only doing justice with the stories but with the music too. This is how you should remake a song without killing the original one.  YUVA vibes all over!
Am i only one who is very excited to watch Sunil grover  in this fire look...?? 💥
Only for A R Rahman!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_GOpW7dAsg&amp;t=35">0:35</a> Sounds like Akshay Kumar
Thank you so much all for your overwhelming response to YouTube channel MURABBI MURABBI... A R Rahman musical YouTube channel!
No one Replace Ajay Sir
मणि रत्नम की मूवी युवा फिल्म का गाना ह जी ये 😀😀😀😀 copypaste 😎😎😎
Amazing 😍🤩
A.R Rehman 🔥🔥
Sunil grover has too much fab
Show this to Tanishk Baagchi. He should learn how to remake a song from this video 😒😒😒
Yuva’s theme song copied.
Youth of the country is destroyed in hatred , fake news , unemployment .... Youth has power to change the system..
LOOKS LIKE KANHAIYA KUMAR, SHELA RASHID, UMAR KHALID
Bhakto 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🤟🤟😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🤟🤟🤟🤟😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🤟🤟🤟😁😁😁😁😁🤟🤟🤟
Yes, i am not here for song, i am here for movie
Love you saif ❤️❤️❤️
AR Rahman&#39;s every creation is timeless!
In just 10sec got goosebumps awasome man👍
support farmers 💪🏻
looks like, the Tandav is very similar to Ajay Devgan&#39;s Yuva movie. Even the music is matching with it.
भिक्कार काम आणि सुमार अभिनय आणि कंटाळून काम करणारे!
HansRaj College✌
It&#39;s a remake song from ajay devgan film yuva they just copied and pasted it when director like Ali abbas zafar are working on web series who remakes bharat and gunday and this series is also based on house of cards 🤦‍♂ I don&#39;t know why they are trying to Destroy Indian web series where they already destroyed Bollywood
Very cool version and video! Especially Zeeshan
Fantastic
rajkumar would be better option than zeeshan
hope it didnt try to justify ndefend the idiotic n antinational deeds of JNU students like kanhaiya gang
Goosebumps this was my fav from movie &#39;Yuva&#39;
awesome thats how u remake a song!!!
Bloody propaganda
This is the power of Rahman&#39;s Music... Always ahead of time.. ❤️❤️
Here for A R RAHMAN SIR❤<br>This song is one of the example why Rahman sir Always called &#39;Ahead of his time&#39;❤
Now That&#39;s A lot of Talent🔥
Thanks for reviving this song without spoiling it !
wow wow wow....what a Song❤️❤️❤️<br><br>Thank You A R  Rahman Sir
Abb web series meh bhi remake kyun karey hai bhai
Kudos to the creator...for this recreation👌👏
Is the series based on JNU and Jamiya Islamiya???
A. R. Rahman majical
So this is basically CAA-NRC protest on reels.
Surya movie song thane ithu
If this doesn&#39;t make you watch the show, then I don&#39;t know what would!
AR RAHMAN 💖💕
Justifying the original track<br>Thanks for not ruining it..

Ar Rahman OP
This song has come a long way!
Music magician AR Rahman sir 😍🙏😍 <br>Yuva
Hindu virodhi
This happens only in reel life,real life  is Kanhaiya kumar lost bihar elections
Rahman Saab... you lifted my spirits again! This is one of my all-time favorite tracks and Thank God you re-mastered it yourself, not any Bag&quot;chhii&quot; or &quot;Bad&quot;shah.
Music effects 👌👌👌although it&#39;s taken from ajay devgan starrer Yuva
IMO Zeeshan Ayub is terrible casting in front of Saif Ali Khan to counter.
Needless to say, the original video of this song from Yuva is gonna get a lot of attention.
technique hi galar h tumhari apni party wali
Sunil Grover is a miscast. He looks like a joker
superb
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_GOpW7dAsg&amp;t=83">1:23</a>
I want a role
1: 23 the sound effect is soooooo hilarious
wow
Amazon Prime is really doing great job...Maximum best series of India are from Amazon be it Family Man, Bandish Bandits, Panchayat, Breathe, Mirzapur , Afsos, Patal Lok and now Tandav... Too good
Dumb Brain video
Bollywood series are really on 🔥🔥🔥🔥 but movies are 😭😭 fasak
This is how you remake a song without destroying the original essences
Are those actors playing Rahul Gandhi , kanaiya kumar? And those beating scene was from Jamia or Jnu?😂🤣 Controversy coming soon
Song and music 🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_GOpW7dAsg&amp;t=27">0:27</a> jab jab raavan ayega- shows saif ali<br>is that a nod to Adi Purush?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_GOpW7dAsg&amp;t=164">2:44</a> Beautiful 💋💋love u💋💋
Yaaaaaa it&#39;s yuva movie song... great song
Who thinks that saif ali khan is amit shah and that boy is kanhaiya Kumar JNU😀
Jabardast
Is this YUVA 2 ..?
Ab OTT par bhi remix gane chalu ho gaye  😭
2004 comes back
Looking strong
Eagerly waiting please don&#39;t disappoint
Who else find similarities in Zeeshan Ayub character and Kanhaiya Kumar ?
Saif on fire...he is really talented..
This is going to be real big
Mr AR.Rehman Plz Do not Enter in This Remix Shit🙏🙏😎😎
Season 2 jarror ayega❤️
Sunil grover fan like here
Sunil Grover looks like a badass in this series.
Seems inspired by Mani Ratnam&#39;s Yuva. They&#39;ve used the songs too
Sunil Grover😍
Modi vs kanhiya kumar<br>I know the story☺️☺️☺️
😍💖🎶

This is what we call a remix of old song...true gem of india ar rehman sir
15 ko Tandav, 19 ko Family Man trailer, phir 12 feb ko Family Man, mein to busy :)
Rehman magic still better then today s recreation songs
Renamed it as JNU
All time I listen this song goosebumps in my body
chutiyapa sunil gober
Amazing 🔥🥂🥂
Saif Ali Khan Is looking dashing
Lol Nice try to peddle Communist agenda... JNU type street and student politics ...raising slogans and inciting violence. Also note the Bhagat Singh Quote. Communism has a place in a democracy but there is no democracy in Communism. P. S I absolutely love the song. It&#39;s pumping and AR Rahman is a magician.
Murari of Ranjhana ❤️❤️  learnt his politics from Kundan😉
A R Rehman 🙏
Yf
Glad they didn&#39;t remixed and ruined this
We are waiting for this series 🔥🔥
Zeeshan is new ayushmaan khurana <br>Hitmachine
Legends know .. its an old song from movie Yuva
All hail to Rahman sir !!!!!!😃😃😃
Now this adds to the playlist of protesters.....new song to be played at some protest hadd hai
Always AYUDHA EZHUTHU  is mass.... Waste REMIX....Suriya presence impossible
A R Rahman
Youth ko politics par ana chahiye tab hi hamre desh ka kuch ho sakta hain ...<br>Jay Hind❤
Very nice 😍💋 💝💖♥️❤️
Zeeshan is the best bollywood actor
Ab hoga tandav
