Vikram Bhatt movies ke baat he aalag hai
Kitni mehnat karni padti hai yaar.
This is going to be one of the greatest horror Bollywood movie !! <br>Even before it&#39;s release I&#39;m waiting for the other ones in the franchise....
All the efforts invested in making a movie is a movie itself.
Huge respect for VICKY 🙌🙌🙌

Congrats for The movie To Your Team
Really Vicky survived a lot...<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23salute">#salute</a> to Vicky
The success of this movie will mostly depend on the sound......sound will be the key.....take my words......Dolby Atmos has the power to create any environment and if they used it effectively and release this movie in dolby atmos in every theatre in india then keep my words it will be a blockbuster.....otherwise it will be like a normal horror movie....baseless.
&quot;Exams are getting ovee on 20 feb , feeling damn lucky , gonna watch on 21&quot;😁😁
I wish this movie is not related to Hollywood movie Ghost ship (2002)
i feel this movie wont earn as much as it can due to students exam i am one of them

What i just watch part 1 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwmFlSY_UU&amp;t=190">3:10</a>
Is the story of the film real?
Grammar wise, shouldn’t title say “Trapped ON the Haunted Ship” ?
The good thing is that there is no song in this movie otherwise other horror movies have songs in it dont put songs in horror movies 😂😂
It will break all records
So Karan Johar Nade shit movie Content but Very Nice Netflix Content<br><br>Now he is doing the reverse
Is this ship still there on the Juhu beach or was it again made for d movie ???
Hollywood level
damm u guys used a audiojungle copyright BGM, dude please send it to us will purchase the music for u guys

Bhot hi achi movie hone vali hai.... Bhot achi cinematography.. or storyline... Ummed h love story na ho
Why you let us know nobody gives a fuck everone know its a business
😂 😂
Am I the only one jissey trailer dekh k darr nahi laga?😂
After bigg boss..
Atkeast Bollywood is now experimenting !! Loved d idea ... Even though a good English movie with similar theme came long back
Ek dusre ki video puri Dekha Karen Kyunki video ka watch time pura hoga Nahin to video banane ka kya fayda
Thumb nail me muje ye parmish verma laga😂😂
Theres so much behind the scenes.. thats why do not criticise unless its really bad.. <br> *student of the year 2 ahem ahem

Dedication will pay off....hatsoff vicky
Hollywood movie hao raha ha kya??? Sb kuch English may explain kar raha ha
Bhai hollywood nai Bollywood me ho aap or sab k sab Bharat ke nagrik .......to kripeya Dharma production valo hindi pe zor do
Saale angrej de bachhe .........saaleyo sadi rashtra bhasha hindi aaa........
They shouldn&#39;t have revealed that it&#39;s a studio, not an actual ship. At least not now.
Its something new and great . And ya its a bollywood movie which is truly horror .
Lagta hai Karan johar ka dimaag sahi jagah pe aa gaya
Non Dharma - Dharma film . 👏<br>This kinda publicity/promotion is better than nonsense social media interviews silly games etc .  tiredness comes easy to acknowledge on actor&#39;s faces
When you&#39;re having a Stairing contest with a Doll AND YOU WIN....
These types of movies makes us feel like bollywood is growing.. ❤
Also feel few comments are paid comments , i didn&#39;t see anything exciting but vicky&#39;s and crew efforts .
Ghost ship ki copy hai🙄
Going to watch this movie for sure
This movie is going to be big hit man. congratulations to vickey
Vicky Kaushal so super and intelligent actor
Waiting for this movie<br>Only for Vicky and his efforts.....<br>In fact a lot of efforts.......even in his pain<br>Definitely gono watch this movie in theatre for that experience.......lots of love for Vicky
Agar real horror stories sunni hai toh jaldi se mere channel ke photo par click Karo. 😱😱😱🖤
When vicky got hurt I actually cried! He is so sweet and i love him so muchhh😢😢😢😢😢😢😍😍😍😍
Heavy hardwork can be seen this made us curious for movie
This movie is going to be Bollywood&#39;s one of the best horror movie , hope so 😉😉😉
Hopefully yeh movie revolution laigi horror genre meh<br>But bc mera boards ka exam rahega😭
Only vicky kaushal can do this
Maine book kardiya first day last show <br><br><br><br>Raat ko bhoot dekhne me alag hi maja hai

They are giving very much efforts.
Vicky khaushal expression are actually so real I feel when I was seeing taliar is that Vicky khaushal is not doing acting it feels like he is naturally doing hats of to him to do this natural acting and make this movie more scary and feel like their is real bhoot
Puri movie hi daaldo na youtube pe

Jobhi apna bhai smjh k <br>Subscribe krne ki sochra h<br>Please krdo 😭❤️❤️❤️
If this film works it would be such a breakthrough in indian film industry...as people will thrive for such unique stories....encouraging others to try out and explore different story!
The work they do in term of sets and thier dedication towards shoot  and everything sets to be in screen and what we do we just criticize them thats it
I wish fl2 k romantic scenes naa ho 🤐
Tumbbad is legendary movie of all time ❤<br>Wanted one more movie like tumbbad
Non drama ..drama film
.. Very horror
Maren ge sab ke sab🤢🤢🤢🧟‍♂🧟‍♂🧟‍♂
This might be not on conjuring 2 level but it will be one of the best Hindi horror movie atleast without any sex.
AAP and BJP both leaders are sitting in cinema<br>Horror scene started <br>AAP: Hanuman chalisa started<br>BJP : ram ram ram ...<br>Then audience : Abbey sale..😂😂<br>Bhoot : oye mujey maro.. Hollywood I&#39;m coming✈️

Already a movie is there in Hollywood.The movie name is Ghost ship.
This movie should be released on 14feb
Surgical strike on bhoots !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sab abhi he mat shikauo

Jitna emotional hai na double darawna hai
You don&#39;t need to make people fly to make a movie  scary
Ye movie gadar machayegi.......aaj lag jaiyagi hall me...🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
bhoot: how&#39;s the josh?<br>vicky:  aage se nahi hoga sir <br>maff kardo
This movie is going to be super duper hit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwmFlSY_UU&amp;t=106">1:46</a> ok so now for marketing a Dharma film you need to claim that it&#39;s like a Dharma Film 😂😂
But , Tumbbad is Masterpiece
<i>Har din thora thora kr K full movie dikha doge kya</i>  trailer me hi😂😂😂😂
U guys have done an amazing job ..😊😊😊
Think must watch movie for Vicky
Ananya : mai struggler hun.<br>Vicky:mai chu***ya hu😅

Imagine if director would be KARAN JOHAR😅😅
The movie is biggest horror movie of all time in india
Hume totally horror story movie chahiye masala tadka nhi chahiye hum Vicky ji ke liye hi theatre jai ge  <br>Maybe movie achi ho
Bhoot exists ,yes <br><br>Just behind u ,someone is there ,u can&#39;t see . But someone is watching u every moment. Now turn off the lights ,and peeche to  dekho ,m not joking ,meri 3 saal pehle bike accident Mai maut ho chuki hai ,yes ,we exists
Just hats off to the team and especially Vicky.
Only disadvantage it will have  is due to  it&#39;s release date .most students who are eager to watch it , are having their exam like me.<br><br>Apart from it , it&#39;s gonna set a bar for other horror movies.The trailer was too scary compared to others.
