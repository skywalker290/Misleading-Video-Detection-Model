Thanks to that crazed woman people feel it is ok to shit on this masterpiece. Calling it a rip off of 8 Mile is just pathetic as it is based on the real-life stories of two underground rappers based in Mumbai. This movie will continue to age well due to the sheer amount of talent (the rappers) who worked on this while that psychopath will fade into obscurity.
I remember when some morons started to lambast this movie in favor of Chhichore and questioned the relevancy of Ranveer Singh&#39;s getting honorary accolade for his role and performance in Gully Boy. For me, this movie was far and far better than all of its contemporary movies released in 2019. Yes, SSR did a good job in Chhichhore, but you can&#39;t base your premise by using Chhichhore to criticize Gully Boy calling it a trash movie. That&#39;s why I say, only biased and stupid people will call this movie trash. <br><br>For me, it was one of the best movies, not because of the raving performance of the cast but due to portraying a good cinematic message of &quot;when the going gets tough, the tough get going.&quot; <br><br>And lastly, Zoya is definitely India&#39;s one of the brightest minds who know how to direct a movie with great cinematic values.
Maturity is when you realise that the guy in first battle was kr$na.
Starting line is voice of krsna ❣️
The fact that this trailer starts with KR$NA&#39;s verse just takes the trailer to a whole new level ... 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kr$ <br><br>Mallom hai na
Is this idea taken from Eminem&#39;s 8 Mile?
apna khana ayega tu abs le kar aya hai mota ho kar jayega
Oscar mila?
Apart from kangana,I actually feel this it gives me motivation
Though, it&#39;s a love story. <br>But still, informative and inspiring. <br>Atleast the Indian masses will   treat &#39;rappers&#39; with more sensibility.
Neazy 👑
Masterpiece
When you realize movie starts from an og kr$na&#39;s Dialogue 🔥
Harika bir konu,oyuncu ve şarkılara sahip bir filmdi. Beklentimin üstünde güzel olmuş.
One of the best movie of Bollywood, masterpiece ❤️
I am here after hearing that Sardar Udham got rejected for Oscar. Some people were also saying that those same jurys accepted GULLY BOY for Oscars, implying that this is a bad movie. Smh
&#39;&#39;khaa meri kasam&#39;&#39;<br><br>&#39;&#39;marr jaayega tu&#39;&#39;<br><br>😂😭
People must understand that Gullyboy too was a masterpiece. It was based on Divine and Naezy&#39;s Bombay Street life. It involved Zoya Akhtar, Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh. Yes, it involved nepotism. *I&#39;m not supporting nepotism*, but the movie was really not bad. Divine fans must know this. The thing is , another masterpiece called CHHICHHORE💯 came in , these two movies shouldn&#39;t be compared. If compared, competition destroys both the Fandoms. 💔
This movie is a masterpiece
Can&#39;t believe I took so long to watch this movie...stunned. speechless. What a brilliant brilliant movie 👏 👏 👏 Ranveer&#39;s performance wrings your heart out..this is a classic!!!!! And Alia...in some cases nepotism is great..and she is an example of that!!! She is more brilliant than all the bolly actresses put together ❤
Who is here after 8 Mile?
8 miles still best...no one can beat it
Aa bolo aazadi
This movie was good<br>People used to praise Gully Boy a lot. Only after SSR&#39;S death same people started hating it.
Ngl but this movie is op🔥
Naezy aur divine best rapper
Divine has a underrated role in making of this film
Very very beautiful
chhichore had story no acting ,gully hoy has acting ,dialogues and story
First line is from kr$🤞🥵

Whole beef is planned before it&#39;s releasing to understand the underground hip-hop scene..😑💯
I think almost 99 % of those who hated on star kids after Sushant&#39;s death, including even kangana herself, if they had been in the place of star kids, would have definitely taken help of the likes of Karan johar and yet they hate on these people for doing favouritism. This  hatred shows how immaturity runs through our new age public discourse which is dominated by the likes of kangana ranaut. Even if she is meritorious actor, this hating on others is not just right.

this movie is a masterpiece. truly loved it
the trailer starts wid the voice of a legend 🔥🔥🔥

Yes Gullyboy didn&#39;t deserve an Oscar but that doesn&#39;t means it&#39;s a bad movie .

If they think this is a copy of 8 Mile then RIP to them
Kangana before Sushant&#39;s death: I loved Ranveer&#39;s performance in Gully Boy and Alia&#39;s performance in Raazi.<br>Kangana after Sushant&#39;s death: All stars in Bollywood are garbage.<br>WHAT A HYPOCRITE
So everyone ignored kr$na🙄
Only for KR$NA 🔥🔥
This movie doesn&#39;t deserve to win that awards it&#39;s good but not brilliant
i was never been a fan of alia, but after seeing this movie, i think, i have understand why people love her so much, she is too cute yaar, i have just fall in love with her..
i literally don&#39;t give a F whatever people think about this masterpiece but it&#39;s really one of the best movie ever made in bollywood people are not hypocrite here they are confused cause they don&#39;t even know what point of view have to be followed because they didn&#39;t have their own thinking rip logics<br>i didn&#39;t watch much movies but when it was released my friend recommended this to me and i really thankful to him for that i really liked it so much<br>best performance by all and good story line i know it is similar to 8mile but its not a bad thing about it because its okay to be inspired from a creation<br>and there is a big difference between copied and inspired
Don&#39;t know why people hate Alia yes she is dumb but she is talented and also cute😂
Only for KR$
बकवास  ,  सब हॉलीवुड पिक्चर  &#39; 8 Mile &#39;  का कॉपी किया  हुआ है l  🙏
Naukar ka beta Naukar ab change ho chuka hai. Naukar ka beta ab malik banta hai.
Nice movie
Allia is real genius
Gully boy is the best thing I&#39;ve ever watched. ...........It deserved that success........it is such an inspiration for all those who feel that their so called bad conditions  are pulling them  back ......I think who have disliked should watch it again and feel it 💖
Only Hear For A krsna 🔥👏
Trailer Ka First Word Says Krsna 🔥🔥🔥👏
Trailer Started With Krsna Voice 🔥🔥🔥👏
Motivation
Since no one is talking about Alia here , so i want to say about her . She is one of the most versatile and talented actress in Bollywood . She literally did an amazing and outstanding job in this movie . Ngl Zoya should give her more screen time in this , what a great actor she is 👍 but seriously whenever any scene of Alia comes , she totally overshadows ranveer singh , this tells how great actor she is .
And why for heavens sake, this was sent to Oscars? To degrade the value of Indian cinema worldwide?
I am not here to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but this is such a terrible movie. Nonsense, overrated. Till the end, I was waiting for some magic to happen based on the amount of rave reviews it has received. 🙄🙄🙄
I am here to dislike this trailer👍

Who is here after kgf : chapter 2 teaser ..
I&#39;m honestly pretty upset seeing this mob mentality from Indians... I&#39;m in the US, and I was in an anthropology class where we were going to watch Slumdog Millionaire to study the Dharavi slums of Mumbai. I told the professor to try Gully Boy instead since SM is outdated and by a British director. She loved this movie. She&#39;s using this in her classes now to teach about India. <br><br>Soo... you can hate it as much as you want, but it&#39;s a brilliant movie that&#39;s being viewed and studied by people. Not to mention, ALL these musicians are the same underdogs you say we should support. Don&#39;t just talk, go actually support them.
People just can&#39;t simply accept that this movie was a masterpiece and is giving unnecessary hatred which it doesn&#39;t deserve. If they are telling that alia is a nepo kid then shraddha too is a nepo kid in chichore . By that logic even u can criticise chichore
Both hard
Faaltu movie hai 😩
Awesome movie ❤️❤️❤️👍👍
I don&#39;t know if Zoya Ma&#39;am or anyone from Tiger Baby is reading this, but I have an honest request to make.. Gully Boy is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I loved every second of it. I even loved all the deleted scenes and there are many of them. So please, I request Zoya Ma&#39;am to release the Director&#39;s Cut of Gully Boy. If someone can even show this comment to Zoya Akhtar it would mean a lot🙏❤

Wow
Worstest movie
Worst movie ...
Here after Kangana &#39;s big speach on nepotism and short minded thoughts about star kids no offence but if she is really possessive about these thing she should have said openly right there and then when these legends were getting awards and this is actually award deserving but why did she talked about nepotism after SSR death because she wanted footage 🤷🤦

People are such hypocrites before many were praising later those same people said shit. This proves that people can easily manipulate our thinking
Dec 24, 2020 <br>3.22 AM<br><br>Still same goosebumps as watched first time❤️❤️❤️
To be honest this movie wasn&#39;t bad nor was Chhichore but after Kangna Ranaut&#39;s comment, now people aren&#39;t positive about this  movie. GREAT audience!
I am
One of the greatest films

Bhaisaab Mein movie pause karke ye comment aaya hun ki mujhe aaj pata chala ki Starting mein Sher jis se battle kar raha hai vo KR$NA hai!😁
why the Bollywood movies still soooo shity!!?
I dont say its a bad movie it says a lot about underground rappers and there story.. but it wasn&#39;t just necessary to hand them over all the awards. The movie deserved but not each and every cast of the movie
Why gullyboy is getting  best film chichore is far better than this.Chichore should get best film
Everyone must be loving chichore but i love gully boy . I know that alia is star kid but her actions and acting was damn good and sushat acting is also damn good but ranveer also struggled to reach at this level so i think both are amazing but my favorite is chichore if you agree then like if you disagree then comment
I m here only for krsna&#39;s intro&#39;s part....krsna bhai big fan
Trailer Start With Kr$na Voice<br>K R $ Maloom Hai Na.
First voice is of KR dollar sign tujhe malum hai NA...... (KR$NA)

This is a worst local film I ever seen before and I’m shocked how this 💩 movie got oscar 🤮
Hollywood is making a remake of this, and it&#39;s name is Bully Boy. 😂

They can&#39;t make anything without copying.
Alias fighting is awesome
Kalia 😂
Great movie! His uncle is a typical ignorant Muslim (well as well as his father). He mentions Allah and mix Him with Hindu cast culture. Where does Allah say you are your family?
Bollywood ne aaj tak ek bhi movie orginal nhi nikale ye bhi Eminem ki 8Mile ki copy hai

7.10.2020 and this movie still better than chhichhore .. and Ranveer is the best!
Ranveer .....wow acting
Tab nahi pata thaTRAILER ke starting mein KR$NA hai ..<br>OG!!!<br>😌😌😎😎

Worst ever film in the world
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUz75zsdZkc">https://youtu.be/EUz75zsdZkc</a> 😇
Audience sabse badi hypocrite hai. 1. Number movie hai yeh, Shandaar ekdum. Log jazbaati hoke kuch bhi bhonk dete hai camera kholke aur madarchod chutiye log unki baatein maan bhi jaati hai. Chhichhore aur ye ekdum different movies hai. Comparison ho nahi sakta. Aur bhen ke lodo agar itna hi support dikhana tha chhichhore ko to theater me jaake kyu nahi dekhi. Ab yaha magarmach ke aansu dikhane ki zaroorat nahi hai. <b>who is here after watching kangana ranaut video.....</b> <b>vahiyaad film</b> aur baaki chuttad baatein. Chutiye log saale
If you have seen 8 miles then you will pause this movie and let it go <br>Dude you can copy the movie but u cannot copy eminem rhymes 🥰<br>4 people can bet this  rhymes <br>B reddit <br>Eminem <br>Slim shedy <br>Marshall <br>Real slim shedy fans stand up ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Before Sushant&#39;s death, Gully boy was a revolutionary film, inspirational film, best film and Chhichhore was vahiyaad film full of cuss words, adult language.. after Sushant&#39;s death, Gully boy became vahiyaad film just because of the word &#39;nanga&#39; and Chhichhore became best film, clean film..
This Movie don&#39;t justice to this trailer
Feel Good Movie ❤
Its best Ranveer was a Footpath I think Ranveer will be happy Deepika get selected because he will get her clothes
Worst film got Filmfare
sushant was perfect in this movie
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Time nikal gaya
Jisko yeh full movie dekhni hai mera channel subscribe karlo full movie aplouad karny wala ho isi week main

Beniwal&#39;s tummy boy is best than this trailer

Pemeran wanitanya cantik alami
❤️
This actor must shit in his pants. Fuckface useless creature
We Indians are the greatest hypocrites ever.  Postive comments before Sushant Singhs&#39; (with all due respect to him )  death and negative after.  Seriously ??<br><br>Don&#39;t think of what kangana said or what Alia bhatt said. Just watch the movie and see if it&#39;s good or not, form your own opinions. I felt this was a good movie with real charecters and a gripping Plot. Why hate , just to make a point ??<br><br>In my opinion what we should hate is movies of people like Tiger Shroff, Katrina etc who have  literally 0 acting skills. Their only talent is looking good. Alia bhatt even though she&#39;s a star kid is a good actress actually.
TRAILER STARTS WITH KR$NA VOICE😘<br>KR$NA - G.O.A.T
Ye comment Mai sab chichore kyun likh rahe hai... trailer to gully boy ka hai😐
I Love Alia Bhatt Acting iam became a Fan of her amd Ranveer Combination excellent
Faltu film he
How insensitive can you guys be calling this movie a copy of 8 mile when it is a biopic of Divine and Naezy. Apni faltu argument ke liye unhein to discredit mat karo.
There is no comparison between Gully boy and Chichore. Gully boy basically is a social drama where Chichore is just an entertainment film. Nothing else. As per story, acting ...both the films are good. But as per social impact, Gully boy is far better than Chichore.
Came here just to dislike. I didn&#39;t watch this movie. Just disliking the old movies, because no new new movie is coming.
Honestly as much as I would like to hate this movie I can&#39;t cuz its a really gd movie. Mostly bollywood only potrays the upper class of the society but this....... is one of those few films that has ventured into the lives of normal ppl. Evrybody in this film did a wonderful job even Alia .
Just because that Chichore had better &quot;Message&quot; and the lead actor is dead, it became better than this masterpiece Gully Boy... Audience is the biggest hypocrite...<br><br>Gully Boy is excellent in almost every section like screenplay, director, editing, cinematography, and equally great acting by every cast... Yahaa protagonist ko heroic entry nhi di, aur poori movie me struggler hee rha woh. Moheen jaise character ko kitne pyaare tareeke se likha hai, side aur chota role hote hue bhi impact bana gya..<br><br>Just because &quot;Ghanta hee toh aaya hai&quot; line hai, movie bekaar ho gyi ?? Aise toh Chichore me kitni vulgarity hai. Sexa, hilata hai, Bunty girr gya, etc. Woh chlta hai... kyu ?? Kyuki movie me ek basic sa message hai ki give-up matt karo... And just imagine if CBI also declares the case as suicide, then toh movie ke lead actor ne hee movie ke message ki aisi taisi krdi...<br><br>Point is, don&#39;t change your thinking by someone who never talked about the guy when he was alive, and after his death using him for both her film career and political future...
Start trailer with KR$NA voice.
This movie is 3rd class. I dont how this movie get award and not manikarnika 💔💔<br>If u also think then like it .<br>We all are with u <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kangana">#kangana</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfbxcD6biOk&amp;t=1">00:01</a> is KR$NA ❤ ..IF YOU NOTICE
Very bad trailer
People; <br>Before SSR death: Wow! This movie is awesome!!!!<br>Same people immediately after SSR death: This is a whack ass movie!!!<br>Same people about 2 months after his death: People are such hypocrites!!!!!!
Whos here after seeing the 8 mile movie trailer comment section?
Wht a  bgm of the film .. mind refreshing
Perfect
Proud that its trailer is starting with krsna&#39;s voice <br>🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
Worst film ever
Thug life
Gully boy photocopy of Hollywood movie 7 miles
This copied shit won best film award lol.
Zoya Akhtar and Ranveer thought there would be audience who have less knowledge about Eminem&#39;s 8 Mile 🤭
Jahil rap
Salo gully boy 😡😡 BC desi hip hop app sab Ka bap bohmeia na laya ha .jis Ka Lia ha movie bni chyi thi chutyo tum to Naya Aya ho apna bap Ka nam tak nhi liya ISS movie ma
The actor was not Fit in his character 🤦🏻‍♂️ he was to big there is no Swag on it they should find someone young and fit this Movie or else DeVine him self portraits his story 💯 i definitely not gonna watch this😂🙊
this is just ghatiya film i don&#39;t know why this film got award 😬😬😬😬
Best movie..
I like Ranveer Singh not Alia Bahttttt
Zoya akhtar makes awesome movie maybe it&#39;s considered wahiyat now because isme slum conditions batai hai mumbai ki but when movie released everyone was going mad over it!! This movie was awesome in its sense and cinematography was great calling the film wahiyat just because kangana ne ye movie ko chose kiya apni bhadas nikalne k liye is not fair! Maybe other movies are good but this was also an awesome movie and now kangana is saying just abt anything to anyone she see fit and she is going way beyond herself it&#39;s looking cringy and miserable
Ooo maja a Gaya🤐
Nas is listed as a producer..
Hurgdi
What&#39;s the problem that u guys have with gully boy?! Seriously what&#39;s wrong with the film!
Dislike /this video
Sushant lovers dislike the video
Alia acting is so good 👍❤
👎👎
Justice for sushant sinh rajpoot
Aliya bhatt ko to kush Aata nahi hai Aur film bana rahi hai na jane kahs se Aate hai aise ek dum bhangar move banayi hai kush dhang ki move banao
Bahut ghatiya film h ye kaise award mila samajh me nhi aata h ......ranveer singh mental h..
Ab bolegay ke chichore is better than Gully boy but fuck that mindsets 🥱becz both movie in  his place best but industry  make problem not movie show your love ❤
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
Except Alia and Ranveer the movie was awesome
Let&#39;s Declare Anti-Nepotism Day on 14 June in memory of our beloved SSR Jai Hind🇮🇳
Bekar Chi thu😂😂😠😠😠😭😭 please dislike all  alia bhatt movies
My favorite song love you so much Ranvir muje bhi singing bohot pasand he ✌🤟👍👌❤👄💋
Not a hater and i don&#39;t believe in this bullshit outsider and insider thing . But they should have sent super deluxe for oscar instead of sasta 8 mile .
This movie is very worst movie
This movie tells us that gully singers are way better than Bollywood singers
Who thinks that Kesari movie was million times better than this movie😏
This movie is not at all a wahiyat film.<br>Kangana was just taking advantage of SSR&#39;s death to mock gully boy because of her personal rivalry.<br>I know this movie got some undeserving awards but still it was best film of 2019.<br>The atmosphere of that slum and the language is example of excellent cinematography and not wahiyatpan.<br><br>If a film&#39;s hero lives in slum, uses foul language and has an unorthodox occupation and doesn&#39;t speak any patriotic or feminist dialogue, that doesn&#39;t mean the film is wahiyat.<br>This film has no match in terms of Best Actor, Best supporting actor, Best Film, Best Cinematography.
The hypocrisy of indian audience is end level <br><br>Cant really believe some idiots are comparing two totally different films in terms of genre
Good
Ohhhh Ravir Singh is so much <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ugly">#Ugly</a> 🙊
Actually &quot;CHICHORE&quot; Movie is better then &quot;GULLY BOY🤢&quot;

Worst film in the world like for SSR
One of the best films♡♡♡😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Trade
Chichore is an outstanding movie and gully boy is also a fantastic movie. Some people are just going with flow and now saying that gully boy is not a good movie but these people only were amazed by gully boy when it was released. Everyone was appreciating gully boy and were loving the phrase (apna time aayega). But yes it shouldn&#39;t have won all the awards, this was wrong. Here no comparison of SSR with any other Bollywood actor.<br>SSR was our favorite, is our favorite, and will be our favorite. But don&#39;t change your opinion all of a sudden just to go with the flow <br>Let&#39;s wish justice for dear and beloved SSR 🙏🙏
What a movie....loved it...♥️
Best movie 🤩❤
stupid movie
Who is disliking all of the movies trailers and songs.
This is a nice movie,no bad comments after SSR death
Chichore is great movie than this nulle wale log ki movie
If they can send superdeluxe. Even we can nominate in Oscar or another good  film .not copied <a href="http://one.name/">one.name</a> film name to copy boy 😂😂😂
Just came to dislike
Itni achi film hai Magar kangana ke chaatu peeche parjaayeinge
Suddenly itni hate kyu mil Rahi hai Gully Boy Ko?
Just came here to dislike this shit
Yeh movie hai kya??? 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Lose your self Thika Onek Sean niche
Lots of mistakes we hv done,like for this movie is one of them
Came here to dislike after sushants death
The cover has been blown off of Bachchan’s, Kapoors,  Khans, Padukone, Shetty &amp; others in the Bollywood Cesspool as their political ties become amply clear ....they are all about their own material gains and fame. Satyamev Jayate was only a formula for commercial success. Shameful! Disgraceful! Not one word for the national treasure &amp; their extremely talented Bollywood brethren, Sushant Singh Rajput, who was viciously murdered?!!

The one and only undisputed legend of a Bollywood, an exemplary human being and a national treasure, Sushant Singh Rajput ❤️ Complete boycott of Bollywood, do not click on any of their videos, do not view, do not comment, do not like or dislike. Down with Zoya &amp; Farhan Akhtar, Javed Akhtar, Shabans Azmi for supporting the influential criminals guilty of murdering a national treasure, an icon, a legend, Sushant Singh Rajput. All Bollywood celebrities have shown their true colors...Bachan family, Akshay Kumar, Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Kareena Kapoor; not one word requesting inquiry into a murdered legend, SSR. We will not be silenced or distracted or fooled by Rhea, Pithani, Pancholi, Khan, Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena, Baby Penguin, Mumbai Police. Indians, all over the world have their eyes on Republic TV, Ujjwal Trivedi, Ishkaran Bhandari, the Supreme Court of India and CBI. Maharashtra Govt and Mumbai police are involved and protecting the true criminals. They have reasons to cover up the murder of a legend. All their actions and mishandling of the case are evidence enough of their guilt. Shameful that major Indian media channels are still not giving SSR the fair share of coverage. They’re scared...just like the Bollywood celebrities. If SSR fails to get justice, the common man of India will have no shot at justice ever again. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#Justice4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbiforssr">#CBIForSSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23globalprayers4ssr">#GlobalPrayers4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywood">#BoycottBollywood</a>
Fuck Gully Boy! Fuck Ranveer! Fuck Zoya! Complete boycott! Down with Zoya &amp; Farhan Akhtar, Javed Akhtar, Shabans Azmi for supporting the influential criminals guilty of murdering a national treasure, an icon, a legend, Sushant Singh Rajput. You chose to side with the oppressor and the murderers. We will remember where you stand on this. It is NOT a witch hunt or a media trial as you would like to portray on your fictional narrative. It’s but the opposite. If this was Farhan hanging from the ceiling fan, would you claim the same position?!Hypocrisy! All Bollywood celebrities have shown their true colors...Bachan family, Akshay Kumar, Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Kareena Kapoor; not one word requesting inquiry into a murdered legend, SSR. Complete boycott of Bollywood, do not click on any of their videos, do not view, do not comment, do not like or dislike. We, the Indian masses will not be silenced or distracted or fooled by Rhea, Pithani, Pancholi, Khan, Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena, Baby Penguin, Mumbai Police.

Proud to dislike this fake directors and actors shit .....sadak 2 sadak pe laye na...now your future films will face the same fate<br>Challenge to any Bollywood film..dare to beat Dil bechara the most liked trailer 10 m likes......proud farewell for SSR and Dil bechara 🥰
Alia Bhatt doesn’t know anything except Gulu Gulu dialogue! Shame on the partial Bollywood! Awarded her and chose this movie for Oscar instead of real great movies like Tumbadd!
Haq se dislike kro
Shitty Bollywood
billo tu agg
i like Sushant but chhichhore was a boring version of 3 idiots.. this film is superior
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEI0Q99QzzE">https://youtu.be/oEI0Q99QzzE</a>
Jo Jo iss movie ko flop bol rahe vo sab k sab chutiye aur Kangana k kutte ye movie sab raapers k liye inspiration he ye uss har ek insaan k liye inspiration he Jo Kuch artistic karnaa chahata ho❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<br><br>Zoya Akthar best director 😘

One thing I realised after reading these comments is that Indians are the biggest hypocrites. <br><br>Man first u hype a movie then abuse now.<br>Why?? Because of shushant?<br>Abe chutiyo jb wo zinda thaa tb tumne usse star bnaya?<br>Audience kuch nepo kids ko psnd bi krte hain thbi ye logg sign bi hote hain.<br><br><br>Abe bc yaha thumbaad jesi film famous nhi hoo payi kuki tum loggo achi film pehchan nhi paaate. Aur gully boy is not a bad movie or anything. U just want to go with the trend aur bss isko dislike Krna hain bcoz isme alia hain aur Film fare win kia. <br><br>Abe bc kudh kuch Krna nhi iss movie ko gaali do jisme bhut hardworking rappers, filmmakers ne kaam kia.<br><br>Abe phle kudh bdlo. Tbi bollywood bdlega. Wo tumhe wahi dika rha hain jo tumhe psndh hain.

The worst movie in the bollywood who got many awards because foolish people&#39;s in this movie
The public is being very biased after Sushant’s death. If the roles were switched- if Ranvir was an outsider and was dead and Sushant was a star kid, then I am sure all of you would be going on Sushant’s videos and commenting “flop actor, nepotism, flop film”. Alia bhatt and Ranvir are genuinely good actors and they deserve the awards, not because they are star kids but because they are good actors.  This film is also good. Chichore was also good. You dont have to pull other films and people down if you liked Chichore.

boycott   Alia Bhatt said in coffee with Karan that she wanted Sushant Singh Rajput dead.
Useless movie
Dislike karo
Gully boy is the best and chichore is also best but ranveer killed it bro
It&#39;s embarassing and shameful to think gully boy released in the same year as super deluxe. Bollywood movie makers should learn a thing or two about SCRIPT and CINEMATOGRAPHY from Tamil and Malayalam cinema.
All people sucks who hate this movie ....
All u people who r disliking or talking bull shits don&#39;t forget this was the movie which was selected as the official entry to oscar.and u wer the people who loved and made a bit now talking nepotism bla blaaa. When dilbechara came u were the people who told shits about Dil bechara now dead opposite and started to compare films of different jonours... And don&#39;t dare to talk about aliaa who has been selected to Oscar academy. U may say film fare and all awards are fake but Oscar is not just a word ❤️
Wese dekha jaye to iss movie me koi burai ni h mjhe tb bhi acchi lgi thi or aaj bhi acchi hi h
Who is here after harsh beniwal gully boy proof song
Chichoore and Sonchirya is much better than Soty 2 and gully boy!! 😠😠😠😠
I just watched it and I love it!!!!! Excellent work!!!
Sonciriya 100 time better than this flims sorry sush we just want to see tiger&#39;s 2 rupe&#39;s body building and ranveer , varun copied flim bt not sociriya rabbta kedarnath others
I&#39;ll watch it tonight, Amazon Prime.
Fuck nepotism<br>I hate Salman Khan
8 Mile : Like👍<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Gullyboy : Nothing just scroll down.😒
This movie is a fucking copy of the G.O.A.T Eminem&#39;s legendary movie 8 mile. And the song Apna Time Ayega also copied Lose yourself.😡😠🤬 Thats why I Hate Bollywood films. They are nothing but master copycat. I&#39;m totally disliking this video. Not just this. Dil Bechara also copied famous movie The fault in our stars and Koi mil gaya copied ET. What a SHAME!!!!!😠
I have to watch the 8 mile trailer after watching this
Chhichore should have won best film not because it was better but because it had an important message. Alia didn&#39;t have an important role in this movie and she got Best Actress.🧐
Why kangana said that this movir was shit<br>The acting was totally good<br>By RANVEER<br>SIDDHANT<br>ALIA<br>AND THE LYRICS BY JAVED AKTHAR SIR
LAUDE RANVIR    TERI GULLIBOY IS SASTI COPY OF EMINEM&#39;S....ALL TYM... CLASSIC 8 MILES.... KUCH.. TOH... CREATIVITY DIKHAO CHUTIYON.... SAB COPY KARTE HI BC....SOUTH YA FIR HOLLYWOOD....
8 mile can i copy your homework?
Filmfare awards giving this Awards Movie like Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress etc. It Reason, because Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt are Starkids. What a stupid Jury to organzie. Shame you Bollywood and Filmfare!<br><br>Slumdog Millionaire is better like Gully Boy!
Most Chutiya movie I have ever watched. And it won the best movie, is it? Were the judges on dope or had eaten pig shit before voting for it😂
Otha seruppu must have nominated .. wonderful movie ...who all missing otha seruppu in nomination like here
कुत्ता सलमान कुता कपुर
😩😩dirty movie ranveer singh and aliya bhatt very disgusting
Ye movie kha pr dekh skte h
god i cannot stand all you fuckers in the comments dishonoring the type of person sushant was and using his death to bash on a movie that had nothing to do with his depression i am so sick of you
https://youtu.be/Ay_OFv8XpjA
Chichoore is the best movie in 2019. Who the hell gave this movie the award &quot; BEST MOVIE OF 2019 &quot; .
Gully boy is good movie. But Chichore and Tumbad far better
Best movie <br>Good story line😍😍
Watched it......Superb Movie....Alia and Ranveer and also the other actors in the movie Everybody Nailed it...
Bakwas
जय श्री राम 💪
Keep disliking guys.
Kisiko kyo nahi pata chala ki &quot;8 mile&quot; ki copy hai ye film🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Wow how people have now started talking negative about this movie. But remember when it was released people were going crazy wearing those Apna Time Aayega T-shirts, chanting Alia&#39;s dialogue. Audience is the biggest Hypocrite. U people are saying Chhichhore is better than Gully boy but tell me how many of you&#39;ll really went to watch Sonchiriya and Detective Byomkesh Bakshi. Audience is also equally responsible for nepotism
Google pe search karo kangnaa ne 2019 ki apni favourite movie gully boy batayi thi aur aaj usne mauka dekh ke chauka publicity ki hai,chalo nepotism to saamne aaya
Bakwasssss
Ab kharido awards
Proud to be a disliker
I don&#39;t know why they are uploaded mono audio track. Gandu lok
Trash movie
Legendary dailogue gully boy jeisi wahiyat film KO 13_13 award mil Gaye or chichore jeise masterpiece KO aik bhi nhi
Nice movie but chhichore is superb than this movie
Very dirty and noisy movie, those people are stupid who like this movie
Such a worst movie 🤮🤮🤮🤮<br>Chhichore is 10 times better than this.....<br>Love you Sushant ....❤️❤️❤️<br>We always miss you ....
This situation completely exposed the herd mentality we indians are famously known for. When everyone said it was good, it was good, now when someone said it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s bad. Our opinions are never ours, they are always someone elses. &quot;wE dID iT bOyS wE eNdED nEpOtIsM bY hAtInG rAnDoM pEoPle&quot;
All the idiots disliking this video forgot that Siddhant chaturvedi got his break from this movie.
When the trailer of Dil bechara released long before SSRs death, I saw a lot of meme made by people like &quot;hollywood chaap&quot; , &quot;copy cat&quot;, &quot;we can only make copy of hollywood&quot; &quot;unoriginal&quot; &quot;bakwaas&quot; and now see the comment box of gully boy. <br><br>If there is any villian in this situation, its not bollywood mafia, its not nepotism, its INDIAN JANTA. I am worried about the future of my country for the type of people that live in it.
Ish joya ko award chahiye... Jo 2, 3 film baneke vi ... Director from this film , that film... You are still. Nothing......zoya...
movie bohot acchi hain lekin chhichore jaisa nahi hain.kiyun ki sab chhichore ko 3 idiots ke sath compare kar rahe hain aur 3 idiots ki tarah koi movie aj tak nahi bani
Fun fact 😂 Gully boy has more awards than 3 idiots, Mughle Azam and sholay combined.<br><br>What a wahiyat movie this Gully boy was! 😂
Bakwas film.......
a Flop
Always showing alia as an iim graduate ,medico( liver transplant), student of year , Abe yaar 10 pass hai woh aur president bhi nhi pata <br>I think she was a below avg. Student and sushant was an academic genius which may also be a reason for her envy for him
KR$NA is next level.
You people are disliking this trailer and writing bad coments only because here is a starkid ? SSR ki lifestory  bhi toh kuch aisa hi tha . So atleast please show some respect for the story of the struggle of those people who are just like SSR .
Ghatiya movie
Ali tera gard chota hai
India  se yea movie oscar nomination pe gaya thaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!sala isilie bollywood ka koyi izzat naahi hain!!!!<br>aisa tatti lyrics se filmfare hi jitegaa oscar naahi
Gandu  Film,randi Alia bhatt
Issse bwahiyat movie aauur kuchh nahin ho sakti
How manyof you say this movie is only for apna time ayega 😁😁😁
One time watch film
250 rupaye mein se 200 rs siddharth chaturvedi ke amazing performance ke liye aur songs ke liye aur baaki 50rs mere wapas karo overall below average film now I regret
And some idiots says it is a Flop movie rip to thier mind
Why this piece of shit was sent from India for the Oscars when there were thousand other better films like Sonchiriya and other regional films?<br>This proves why we don&#39;t get an Oscar
shit movie dont watch
Bakwas
Those who r criticising this movie are the ones who are responsible for its 238Cr boxoffice collection. There is definitely something wrong  in sushanth&#39;s death but stop acting silly by  comparing gullyboy with chicchorre, both are different genre movie which are good in its own way. And alia&#39;s acting is way better than many heroine of this generation . <br>BTW i am not a fan of alia though.<br>Stop acting childish😑🤦🏽🤦🏽
Kati zear
Please upload this movie
Wojsjfjt
Disgusting
Cheap actress  Alia bhat 👎👎👎
Chutiya movie story nhi hain ganta nhi hain 😡😡dislike maro es bc movie ko👎👎👎👎

Bina Dare keh rha hun chhichhore is better than this sh*t.
Shame on bolliwood....nepotism😡😡😡😡justice for sush
Maybe the chicchore movie is best than it but why are you telling such a bad words to this movie coz this movie had a lot of real acts anyway it&#39;s an oscar winner♥♥
Ab to logo ko aisi movie pasand aati hai Yeh Kya samjege chichore movie ko 🤓
Tuje dukhtunga movie kar aliya dislikes ka barish hum karenge
Before kangana&#39;s reaction , everyone was like how good this movie is..and suddenly they are calling this movie shit for no reason
JALLIKATTU🔥
Ye chutiya movie chal rahi hai.  Vd pathetic acting.
Guys pls support kangna she is honest
India hate Aliya
Everyone calling this movie shit after kangana&#39;s comment why don&#39;t u guys make a better movie than this<br>It&#39;s really easy to criticise anything unless u urself try doing it once
Worst movie I have ever seen in my life <br>Realy worst movie koi itna ganda movie kaise bana sakta h 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I can proudly say that I have never watched this CHAPPRI movie!😑
Tere movie mein potty karne ki man kar raha hai
8 Mile auf Wish

Awesome movie thi yrr
Last year Kangana herself said &quot;GULLY BOY&quot; is her favorite movie and now she is taking advantage of someone&#39;s death.
Ohh god u all can just make such movies but cannot imply them . YES THATS BOLLYWOOD <br>THE BRIGHTER ITS ON THE SCREEN THE DARKER ITS ON THE BACK<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ripssr">#RIPSSR</a> <br>You were and are still loved
Gully boy movie mein views bhi nhi h film fare award mila h thu h saale

Worst movie
<b>PLEASE DISLIKE THIS TRAILER</b>
It&#39;s funny how people started hating on the movie after Kangana&#39;s video but all you see before that are positive comments. Audience ki hi problem hai. Jab appreciate karna rehta tab nai karte. Hypocrisy 101.
I just finished watching 8 miles,I mean guys seriously... selling chori ka Saman ...bgwn se daro yr
Joote maro Alia ranvir matlab bhat t cam or Khan camp walo ko potty khaao Bharat walo ki kutto justice for shushant
Hatttt bhnnnnn bcccccccccc
Copy of 8 miles
Bakchod movie
Wrong
Alia ❤️❤️
People are saying chichore is better but everyone knows the concepts this movie touches be it domestic violence, poverty, underground rap etc is revolutionary. Please hate nepotism but be mature enough to understand that this is a masterpiece. Also before chichore there was 3 idiots which was much better than it. So chichore had nothing new to offer.
Wahiyad film
Yes .. This is a shitty movie. Which shows nothing but the struggle of Small town rappers..... Hahahaha
Shushant best actor
Chichore best movie
Alia acting bullshit
actually chichhore is infinite time better than this gully boy
Dislike this bakwasss...😡
This movie was deplicate &quot;The most beautyful girl in the world&quot;

Go...And dislike..This video
Faltu movie..vag aliya
I will make dub on this
Stupid story
Nepotism film
This was a good movie, yes I repeat this was a good movie. Definitely not as good as Chhichhore. No way it deserved so many awards. But, I have no shame in accepting this was a really good film with good performances. Just looking at the comments section is making me laugh. This is our Bollywood audience. Double standards of a different level. <br>People are commenting that this is a horrible movie, flooded with such comments. But look at the public reviews, reactions to this movie when it was released. As if this is one of the best movies of Bollywood. No one commented anything negative about this movie. And see now. DOUBLE STANDARDS 👏👏👏👏👏<br>Mein aur kuch na karu, apni baat par tikna jaata hoon. So yes I repeat, this was a good film. But yea, Chhichhore was way better, Sonchiriya was way better. <br>U may write all sorts of negative things in reply, but I can guarantee that even u said that Gully boy is a great film when it released. So I don&#39;t care. <br>For now, looking forward to Dil Bechara. Usko superhit banana hai (OTT platform mein hi sahi). RIP Sushant 🙏🙏🙏 Truly u don&#39;t deserve audience like us.
If u want a proof of double standards among Bollywood audience, just browse through the recent comments and compare them with the older comments below this trailer. Aise audience ho toh industry ko bolke kya fayda🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
Thank God I have not watched this movie .... Trailer is 💩
Alia bhatt..useless nepotism product
Whos here after watching dil becharas trailer
Laora movies laora song🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Best movie ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Awkaad to alia ki nhi haiii
Lets make this most disliked movie trailer ever ... we can do this
It&#39;s funny how before SSR &#39;s death ,everybody was in love with this movie .It&#39;s not about nepotism it&#39;s more about talent and Alia is talented. Even if she was not a starkid ,she would have made it to Bollywood.Mock all the starkids except Alia ,Ranbir and Kareena.
Phaltu flim
How this movie got award ! How falthu movie hai yaar ! Chichorey is 1000times better then this 🖕 movie

Don&#39;t know how this bekar movie take awards
Alia Khan is a fake actress.  Who gave this film an award?  Who is that idiot?
Actor ka beta actor banega ye fitrat hai 😖😖<br>Strugglers: apna time aayega😠💥🔥
If Alia Bhatt is not present in this movie, then I will see this movie at least 10-15 times. But I can&#39;t see the movies of Alia bhatt, Annannya Pandey and afcourse Karan Johar movie,song,etc. This people are like the 😈 at the EARTH. <br>If anyone like SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT then promise with your Heart that you will not see the movies of these 😈.<br>I am not saying to like my comment, I am saying to support truth.<br>Thank you
Kaun kaun is movies ko gali dene aaya h like kro 😂😂😂
Sala iska 2 min 42 sec ka trailor mujhse sahaa nhi jata !<br>Pta nhi kaise kaise madhrchod bhre pde hain jo puri pikchr dekh aaye 😂😂
Bakwas movie poor acting of kalia bhatt
Super flop movie senseless meaningless, shamless Alia Booth.

Another COPYCAT in Bollywood, stealing away awards, like stealing stories, even the scenes from .... 8 MILE (better)<br>The &#39;Akhtar&#39; children lack originality. First Farhan with Don, and Zoya? You people make me avoid Bollywood movies. <br>I thanked God, there were people like Shushant. Now that he is gone...<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ripsushant">#ripsushant</a>.

who came here to dislike this trailer
This movie don&#39;t deserve a award 🖕
I do not like indian Bollywood movies but these movie gave me goosebumps....you know how the story ends but its simplicity and message is so astonishing....really enjoyed
I still remember the craze of this film when it was released. And now suddenly this movie becomes worst for some people who didn&#39;t even watched the film lol. Anyways after few years this film will regard as a classic. Indian critics are not stupid who gave the film great reviews.
Idiot song
One of the most nepotism reflecting film
Kangana:gully boy jasi wahiyaat film ni dekhi mene or usko family fare award de diya <br>Karan johar: m bnaunga tabi to dekhogi.
Lora movie
Kich khas nahi hai<br>8 miles ka copy

<i>Actually its name</i><br><i>should be</i><br> <b>&quot;tatti boy&quot;</b> 😬😬😬
chichoore movie  much much.......much better that this film trust me
I got headache after watching this film pls ignore karo!!!! Is film Koo
People here are being so stupid. Hating a masterpiece. Hating one of the best actors in the industry. Dude you all are emotional fools. Just think critically. Are you all really using your brains or just trapped in some emotional influence. Believing in so called fake news.
Bakwas movie, ranveer hero ni gunda lagta he ic movie me.
Eminem “ 8 Mile “ nicely copied ( of course without shame) 👌😂 No wonder talented 💫 stars like SSR ❤️ suffered a lot. And he was really trying to do different movies all the time...
Gully boy me muslim dikhaya hlgra islie hypocrite hindu iski pasand nei kia do they trying to compare it with chichore  while the 2 film  is totally different topic based. Come on grow up
Chhichhore  Screenplay &amp; Dialogues are 1000000 better than this Entire movie. Overrated non-original GULLY BOY 💩<br>Best Director - Nitesh Tiwari (Chhichhore)✔️✔️<br>Zoya Akhtar (GULLY BOY) ❌❌<br><br><br><br><br>WHO agrees??
Fuck film
Apna time aiga
Best bakwas movie
This trailer is so fucken lit. Stop joining the clout 😂. Bollywood finally made a different film and I know all you liked it from the inside but you&#39;re all liking chhichore because it&#39;s the trend 😂😂. When chhichore came out I watched it in the theatres it was empty, but now it&#39;s a trend so you like it. Both films are fucken amazing understand it

Copy of the movie 8 miles with eminem.
Overrated!!!
Ban kro sala kabad hai ye movie alia bhatt chutiya jaisa acting
This movie is worst ever I have seen
Ghatiya muvi or chutiya actors ....mc
Chichore is batter gully boy Che 😡
Worst  bekar ... Meaning less
A copy of 8 mile 😒
🙂...kuch bhi kho movie acchi thi.
Is this a copy of eminem&#39;s movie
In 8 mile,eminem was atleast relatable and real af!  But ranveer singh does not relate,he smells of nepotism power,sick man who snatch sushant&#39;s chance etc etc I mean no wonder It doesn&#39;t even deserve the O of the oscar !
If sushant was in this movie,it would be more relatable. Talentless actor ranveer singh snatch this movie from sushant by nepotism power. No wonder why this moviedid not  got an oscar or oscar nominee!<br>Jaake filmfare se hi trophy kharid le sick nepos! Your reality has been exposed and this time for real ! Shame on you nepos! Don&#39;t trust star kids and nepo products anymore! Not watching gully boy anymore!
I hate alia vat

Do kodi ki film gully boy ..akk thuu.
Worst Movie i ever seen in my life.. This Movie is only run By Songs.. Otherwise this movie is worst and alia acting is Bakwas
Worst movie and worst song ever ???? But also they receive 13 awards 😂😂😂😂 nepotism sucks 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
NEPOTISM😂😂
CHICHORE IS BEST
Alia Bhatt bad
Chichore is better than gully boy
Chichorre ❤️
Kya faltu filme he
This movie was good. Ranveer’s acting was good, we dont deny that but giving it all the awards and ignoring other good movies and especially giving alia best actress for her 10 minutes performance was straight up absurd and unfair. RIP Sushant
alia bhat tatti acting
Joker.....
Joker actor
Don&#39;t know this film... Came here when they talk about this... It&#39;s just a copy, indian dont do rap😂😂😂😂so funny BOLLYWOOD COPY INDUSTRY
Faltu movie ...
I hate alia bhatt now onwards I like more sushant Singh rajput <br>Who like sushant Singh rajput hit like
khali packet me hawa thi andar wafer hi nahi hai...<br>kyu na bolu bhai ch**tiya bnaya.<br>rap picture ka hero asli rapper hi nahi hai...<br>Rapper,s ko rapper wala role milna chahiye...<br>rapper ko v hero wala role milna chahiye...
Laughing at all the hypocrites in the comment section<br>First they blindly worship gully boy and then just because kangana said gully boy is a bad movie they make the issue gully boy Vs chichore and suddenly star hating gully boy and worshipping chichore to get likes  <br>The issue is not gully boy Vs chichore<br>It&#39;s outsiders Vs nepotism<br>Society Vs mental health<br>We act mean towards people and don&#39;t give a shit about them , ignore them and when they kill themselves we act like we cared for them.<br>If you have even a little bit of respect for Sushant then stop treating people  and your classmates badly because every life matters equally....<br>I think that is what Sushant would want...
It&#39;s a copy of 8 miles and they are sending this shit movie to Oscar I mean........<br>Are you kidding me!!!!!
I have only come here to dislike this 🙄.
8 mile right
It is our fault that a masterpiece movie like Thumbbad collects only 13 cr in box office with no awards and this shit collects 165 cr with 13 awards...shame!
Fully Faltu... Bohot hi ghatiya film
Maa ki chut inki. Make it the most disliked video. How the hell that it got all the awards???

With me, Who else Dis-liked this stupid video after sushant death ?????
Waahiyaat

Hopeless...
