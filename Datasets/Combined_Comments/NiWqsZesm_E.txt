Which would you choose?
I pick. Apple cause it got good quality
In which buds, you guys found better music quality?
I literally dont care
Obviously Airpods. üëç i ride bikes with these they stick in the ear like magic.
Airpods is still the best
People keep telling me why i got mentos in my ears‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the goddamn earbuds
I would choose galaxy buds in my opinion theor better
nice, thank you
I&#39;d agree with almost everything you thought including the different comfort/noticeability, but wouldn&#39;t go for the airpods as much as I feel it makes you look like a dunce üòÖ
I never cared for the sound of the galaxy buds.  I found them to be very tinny and harsh.  The Apple Airpods are a bit better sounding.
They are hard to find I lost one earbud and then I saw my dog chewing it up so now I only have one earbud and I can&#39;t tell my parents
The Samsung Galaxy Buds are the better choice for me, since I would usually be working out or sleep them in my ear.
Let‚Äôs be real, we all bought the AirPods bc they look nicer. And the galaxy buds obviously sound better
The galaxy buds can mute people??!!!
bro which phone is that
I still feel like the airpods are better quality sound.
I have both since I made a switch from Droid to Apple and I use the airpods for a casual outing and around the house and school but I use my Galaxy buds for working out and when I work since I do a lot of moving at my job.
galaxy buds are terrible if you plan on keeping them long term. the right earbud is quieter originally than the left and over time it gets worse, regardless of cleaning or damage. they also start to lose the quick connect feature over time as well.
Have em both. Better the buds..I don‚Äôt like listening to music and also everything else in the background like with the pods..
Samsung earbuds plus
I haven&#39;t used the airpods yet, but galaxy airbuds cons complete out weighs the pros!!!<br><br>It&#39;s touch options sucks compare to soundcore.  The bass not great. But the biggest drawback to galaxy bud is the battery life is really bad and when it&#39;s in its case &quot;charging &quot; and not even in use it is draining and will eventually die. Plus here&#39;s another no go for me. The bluetooth range is horrible, especially compared to the way cheaper soundcore.<br><br>I don&#39;t recommend it
I perfer the AirPods only because I have them and use them on my iphone. My only complaint is,, they die very quickly. I just bought my airpods in the beginning of March
Samsung forever!
How well does the galaxy puds stay in your ears those who have it ?
Air buds and galaxy Pods
Samsung is better
AirPods Pro is the best headphones
Now im left wondering if i have an ear canal similar to this guy ü§®
I think the AirPods Pro wins over galaxy buds since it‚Äôs 2021 now
Looking into getting a new galaxy bud cuz after 2 years I have finally lost both earbuds
Hmmmm I really want to want the galaxy but I always prefer something that is not tight in my ears<br>I guess it depends on each persons ears
I&#39;ve never been an apple user but I&#39;ve  always preferred  Samsung  over Appl eeven when I can afford Apple
Me watching this with wire earphones: üôÅ
I got my clones at IPLAYPODS,CO and they are awesome. They have great sound and mic quality. Design is same as apple. Have everything as them. My recommendation.
I just got airpods because they&#39;re just too comfortable, and the sound is pretty good, I&#39;m done with the earbuds that goes all the way in the ear canal
What is your phone?
I dont know if I fucking hate somebody more than I do with your bullshit fucking channel. Dont make your videos come up to me so you make sure you dont get like this comments... YOU WANT TO SPONSER THINGS SO FUCKING WRITE THIS IN THE FUCKING TITLES.....
Note:Using Razer Hammerhead for this vid. However, I‚Äôd like to say that Apple is so good at what they do in terms of brainwashing us masses. They know how to make companies that make their own wireless earbuds for their own phone, feel as though they‚Äôre using a 3rd party product.  (Follow w/me here)<br><br>How I explain this? Us Apple users (New Apple user actually) feel like there‚Äôs care put into everything but it‚Äôs really just the ecosystem that gives this impression. I know iPhone users that use other brand earphones but I think it‚Äôs psychological tricks more than anything and FOMO. Exclusivity does help because every other phone is on a universal OS whilst Apple has their own and the idea of that is cool, it doesn‚Äôt matter what other companies do if you think about it. <br><br>No matter how you look at it, Apple wins in the end because they work on a basis of, ‚ÄúWell, this is here as an option but those other products will work with ours anyway, we‚Äôre still here when you‚Äôre ready,‚Äù
Believe it or not but samsung whas the first one to make wireless pods, it was called gear iconX
Galaxy buds better than 1more triple driver<br>In sound experience
I feel like the galaxy buds block noise better
I rather have the galaxy buds if they can charge on any phone compatible  with wireless chrage. How convenient is that?!
But he has big ears
My galaxy buds are way more comfortable than my airpods for me. My airpods hurt my ears after like 15 minutes
Im samsung
AirPods gang for life
Is there any lag while watching videos when we use airpods with android ?
I don‚Äôt have galaxy buds. But I do have AKG Samsung earphones doe
Watching with my fake airpods
I like the galaxy buds because they fit in my ears better
The Galaxy Buds+ are far more convenient with that 11 hours of playtime, seal is the best for me and comfortable for long term use
Do AirPods fit like the headphone that come with the iPhones ??
I sense the biasness
Great review!! Easy to understand and has all the considerations for an average user like me. I listen to mainly videos and podcasts. Music, hardly. So I don&#39;t care much for the extra treble, bass features on the galaxy buds. I also don&#39;t jog or do any really physical activities so I don&#39;t need the extra tight fit either. In fact, while I acknowledge that galaxy buds have many more features that work with my Samsung S20+, I might actually buy the airpods just based on the fit. I really find it uncomfortable to have the rubber seal in my ear. Makes me feel like I&#39;m underwater. And gets annoying after a while. I dunno if this reason alone is worth the extra money though. I might suck it up if galaxy buds are not as uncomfortable as some reviewers make it out to be. Anyone willing to vouch for galaxy buds ? Haha.
Just picked up some Galaxy Puds Pro üî•
me watching this a year later on galaxy buds that I got for $50
the beans
I cant fit airpods in my ear for some reason thats why i like the galexy buds
Its a bad thing if you dont feel them,because you can lose them and when you go home you realise you lost your air pods
I have the buds plus
The biggest advantage is- galaxy buds are cheaper way cheaper
How do Samsung buds fit in people with small ears?
I got the better earbuds. Bose Quiet comfort. Those beat both of them easily.
Honestly i find airpods uncomfy because airpods are REALLY light i sometime forget they are even in my ears which makes me really sensitive about them falling also u can hear EVERYTHING outside of the air pods my mom who hates songs can hear it even when the vol is at 1
I had airpods and I just lost them so I‚Äôm buying new headphones... don‚Äôt buy airpods they are just so much trouble
Well i dont like an earphone that hurts when you wear them for a long time.. so i guess im getting the airpods
Your facials are priceless
Prob samsung cause I have a samsung and Samsung has more accessibility, and more features but that is just me.
Galaxy buds of course!
I LOVE APPLE PODSüçé
Galaxy buds plus
The buds i love them
I tink
airpods are better
Apple AirPods all day
I&#39;ve tried galaxy buds and galaxy buds plus and neither pairs well with windows(bad lag and out of sync left and right audio) , I just watched this with airpods 2 and the results were WAY better and I can comfortably put my head on a pillow.
Watch this with my galaxy buds
Airpods rocks
Which sony headphones is he referring to??
Samsung: imma make the price match its quality.<br><br><br>Apple: <br>Imma make the price.
airpods are good stop chatting shitte
I lost my galaxy buds and couldn‚Äôt find them for months so eventually replaced them with AirPods. Found my galaxy buds again so now I guess I‚Äôm stuck with both lmao.
Nice
Watching this video with airpods 2 that i wanted to buy but my parents made a new years gift for me
IPhone users: did that phone just wireless charge?<br>Android users: yeah its called technology <br>IPhone users: don&#39;t belive it... iphone is better
Great video keep up the good work my fams
I dent know this guy is from Canada I am to I am from pei or should I say prince Edward Island üèù
What is the app called
i have bought airpods 4 months ago because of this guy‚Äôs awesome video and idk why i watched it 100 times again.
Im Apple fan, But seriously galaxy buds are much better than airpods who agrees...?üòÖüòÇüòÇ
you sold me at ambient sound because i am a female and i love listening to woman but ALSO need to be aware of my surroundings
Hole
Ive been using the galaxy buds for almost 3 years now!! No complaints whatsover ,i am going for the galaxy buds plus now
I have both buh I prefer the earbuds...they sound soo much better
Me over here switching to AirPods since my galaxy buds started getting muffled and random disconnects
I much prefer the SAMSUNG GALAXY EARBUDS, bec0z I have red in so many reviews that It is much better when it comes to design, performance and quality and It is much cheaper but has the same quality as you see in the APPLE AIRPODS...<br><br>And the Samsung Earbuds has way more glazing color rather than the Airp0ds esp. theyre black ones... Thats beautiful...
Bence airpods daha g√ºzel
Absolutely agree with you about feeling, but I will go for earbuds cuz my note10+
üí©üí©üí©Apple sucks
When you talk with your BIG MOUTH, tell us which is Samsung, which one is apple
F****k you man... You DROVE ME CRAZYYYyyyy
I recently bought AirPods for myself as a gift to myself and the sound quality is brilliant and it also fits perfectly into my ears as I thought it would be the opposite. I absolutely love the apple AirPods
Me: uses 5$ skull candy inkd headphones
I have iPhone but got Samsung buds
How can I fix my Ambient sound doe? Mine wont turn on
Say what you want Android is better, Faster, More durable, and battery last longer.<br><br>But there‚Äôs one reason why they never will beat Apple, because it‚Äôs iPhone üì±Simple.
I love that he isn&#39;t biased.
Don&#39;t buy the Samsung buds they are faulty I&#39;ve needed to get mine repaired twice now. USLESS
Apple ones do not fit in my ears :(
Samsung wins, im going to buy a pair now
Dental floss vs contact lenses
Shine on you crazy diamond is a great song to test headphones.
I love Samsung but I switched to a Iphone a couple months ago and bought airpods. I gave my dad the Icon x and he said he prefers the sound on those.
Watching this on my Airpods I got from last Christmas
mind blowing tech in a small package
&quot;The fit, the feel, the sound seal.&quot;
People are so ridiculous for wanting specific name brands over quality. I had a pair of New Balances that felt like I was walking on clouds, and a similar style Jordan felt like wooden clogs. There was only a $200 difference in price...
My replicas are from iplaypods,com and they are awesome. I love them because they are same as apple ones.
apple is Best.....
Bc sidha sidha btaon konsa sahi hai
I am watching it before I get it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=26">00:26</a> i lost some brain cells
What app do u use on the phone?
Listening to this through my current AirPods, wondering if I should make the switch to galaxy buds
I personally think that it‚Äôs better feeling the bud in your ear than losing it after a week and having to spend another 250 dollars.
Why do people always worship apple when from what I seen Samsung always has more features on their devices
Samsung 10/10 Apple 7/10
I just got some AirPods and I&#39;m sticking with em for now
Air pod pro are so Damm comfortable.
wdym u can still isten to music while the other one is charging
Sir which one is the best
has to be great haveing fitting ears for the samsung buds xD
Never made sense to me about how people talk about how airpods would fall out. With the normal wired apple earphones people never complained about them falling out so what&#39;s the difference with airpods? To me wired earphones would fall out more since the wires would put on a little more weight to the earphones because of the wires.
U can bet ur ass I‚Äôm using my galaxy buds on an iPad right now
They‚Äôre all so pretty üíñ
Samsung fan of you
I like galaxy buds more bc I want to feel it if its in my ear or not bc I don&#39;t want to lose it
Choice is easy:<br>iphone owner: get Airpods<br>Samsung user: get galaxy buds<br>Oppo owner: get oppo buds<br>Etc.<br>Get the ones that work perfectly with your device
Ambient sound is one of the key things for me, I think it&#39;s super essential to be able to hear what&#39;s around you
Great review..can you please review the lypertek tevi
Hey man great video again very unbiased review and you did an awesome job comparing the features of the two like ways. I&#39;m considering the buds vs the Raycons what&#39;s your opinion on those?
Price
i use airpods everyday, they sound great <br>my friend uses galaxy pods, i tried them and they sound terrible
I‚Äôm watching this with airpods lol
Can everyone stop bullying me for my headphones now?
Hard decision but galaxy had so much more pros that air podsüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I always forget my AirPods in my ears lol
The rubber that should keep the galaxy buds in the ear was in his ear the other way üòÇ

I‚Äôm an Apple fan but Samsung is always better which pisses me off. Samsung legit releases there stuff after Apple so the know what they are dealing with and that‚Äôs faxx
Get what you use
The thing with airpods is that its just simple. Sure the galaxy buds have more quality and there are the equalizer features. But airpods are just so so simple it makes everyones lives easier.

Bro airpods are so uncomfortable. Before I had my Samsung buds I used my sisters airpods and they always came out when I moved my hair, they were hard and cold and made my ears hurt. Then I got the Samsung buds and they were so comfortable and the sound quality was just amazing. The only thing I don&#39;t like about them is that the touch pads are so sensible. When I want to put my hands on my ear to hold my head it always passes the music :(
Headphone/buds is like normal Hi-Fi speakers, they start out with the membrane stiff and after some time in use the sound changes a bit. Usually towards better.<br>Bass will then probably be better at lower volume too.
Apple: we are the first with wireless earbuds<br>Some random Chinese: wait a min.. we already did that 10 years ago
I use an iPhone but I honestly prefer the galaxy buds, they work great
Do these work on iPhone
i got my pods at iplaypods,com and they are awesome. i love because they are amazing and quality.
I used the galaxy buds, honestly couldn‚Äôt hear the difference between them and dollar store Bluetooth headphones.
+ the buds can be more confortable when wearing a beanie than the airpods, which help for surviving in Siberia
I‚Äôve walked into work with my AirPods on. I forget I have them on.....
Literarily bought a pair of galaxy AirBuds today and they are shit they keep falling out
i‚Äôve just got air pods pro and i highly recommend if u don‚Äôt mind the price 100% worth it
i was super excited to try the galaxy buds but they literally sound like $10 skull kandy, came here to find out if it was just me or what
this video was quite therapeutic for me I must say. I am team Samsung but maybe I might purchase the apple air pods because I think they&#39;re be more comfortable for me.
Airpods case looks like dental floss
Just bought the galaxy buds. Used then at work today. So far I like them. Need to mess with the fits little more though. I am paranoid they will fall out. Lol
When I saw AirPods for the first time I thought someone had just the top of earpods in their ears... I thought they were just mentally disabled since they looked proud wearing it <br><br>I do live under a rock
I just care about sound bruv and as long as it doesn&#39;t hurt idc
I find Samsung to be more comfortable
Getting mine tomorrow! üòä
Dose the galaxy buds works on iPhone?
Apple toxic fans: Airpod is better than everything<br>Samsung fans: Ok...
For the Quality Imma go for Air pods I love the noise cancellation of it
Did he custom the galaxy buds for his ear with all those pieces?
I&#39;ve been having the s10+ for a while ,my parents got me the galaxy buds for Christmas and I absolutely love them. They have good sound,and feel good. I dropped my left one in water once and it still works perfectly! Also if you lose them they have a find my earbud option which plays a loud beep til you find them, and i love that,i had to use it a couple times lol
I own samsung but got apple but they look so much better when it comes to holding esrbud but sound good too
I have the Samsung galaxy s10e and I use the airpods because to me they sound better
SAMSUNG GALAXY BUDS AND GALAXY S20 ULTRA WOOOOOW CRAZY üî•üî•üî•üî•üíã
do airpods light up a rainbow color when using, bc my classmates airpods does that, or lemme say she fake, she flexüåö
for those who just want to flex i recommend you to buy fake AirPod on online shopüåö
Just want to note that if the Apple AirPods are paired to an IPhone they will do the ambient sound feature as well
Got the galaxy buds even though I have an iPhone. AirPods look stupid to me. Looks like someone ripped the wires off a pair of old headphones and stuck them in their ears.
Dental floss case VS Eye contacts case
I liked the detail of choosing shine on you crazy diamond
Stop the Apple fan boy act and say galaxy buds are better for the music, just because they will fit better and give you more isolation. Why the heck you want to wear a headphones or earphones if you want to always hear the ambient sound. And it is not like Galaxy Buds don&#39;t give you that capability. A lof the times, I am wearing headphones just for noise isolation and so that people don&#39;t talk to me.
When apple users stop being bias. See kids, don&#39;t show partiality. You will find greater things.
And all the things that you said about the galaxy buds have it on the AirPods too
AirPods are better
watching the video while wearing the buds...LOL
It was a hard decision for me to make when i was comparing and reviewing both the apple airpods and samsung earbuds -  i ended up choosing the samsung buds as the quality is equally or even better, you can charge it on your phone and much cheaper than the airpods if your in Australia. Thanks for the video tho.
Just comment as if I said something aggressive and then I will edit it and annoy ppl
On some people the AirPods look a bit huge on their ears and the Samsung looks pretty üî•
What kind of app is he using for the Samsung earbud??
Now I don‚Äôt have the galaxy buds so I can‚Äôt say who‚Äôs batter but like you know people gon buy the airpods like almost no matter what ü§£
Can&#39;t make my samsung airpods stay put into my ears for my life...so annoying
Aorpods is way easier and comfort but galaxy buds is a little bit better in terms of sound .<br>  But u can&#39;t wear buds more than one hour.
For me I can be doing backflips and the AirPods stay in while any size and ear hook on galaxy buds it falls out
I need a quality. what i choose ? plz help me for this
Samsung tha best
I still don&#39;t know what to get. Can you guys please tell what I should get. Please
Tell me why everyone says galaxy buds but I never see them out in public I only see AirPods
Alright, I&#39;m a Samsung person, phones, tablets, TV&#39;s, my fridge, and the earbuds as well... so... I love Samsung, and the quality of the earbuds are great except the FACT that when I&#39;m on a phone call the other person says they CAN&#39;T hear me, and because of that I cannot believe myself for saying this, I am considering of buying the Airbuds Pro
Samsung
I got the Samsung galaxy earbuds to go with my phone. And hated them just threw them to the side and was thinking about selling them. Until my sony earphones stopped working. So was like guess I&#39;ll try them again sat down really went over and set them and adjusted the rubber pieces. And damn I am glad I didn&#39;t get rid of them. They sound ffin awesome. üíØüíØüíØ
I need one of these
I use Samsung but all my friend use Apple.. I don‚Äôt get why üò¢
Can u review Aukey Key Series EP-T10 most review state they are better than air pod n Samsung bud

Apple earpods are just cheap plastic
People saying that they&#39;re watching with Galaxy Buds and Airpods, but alas, I&#39;m sitting here with my $30 Pasonami earbuds.
Galaxy buds to the world!ü•≥
I bought both and here&#39;s my unbiased opinion<br><br>The galaxy bud (bought 120 used) case is easily surface scratchable, it can get dirty inside and charging can be interrupted because of that. The case requires a button push to get open. The rubber on the buds gets gunky easily. The buds are very uncomfortable how deep you have to wear them in your ear. The sound is good and I like yhe ambient mode but the bass isnt the best. The app is cool but i don&#39;t really care about opening an app to do a bunch of things.<br><br>Air pods (second gen) (i got used for 70) the case is nice and small and easy to open and close and put your buds back in.  They fit my ear very nice and the weight of them is great and theyre very comfortable. They don&#39;t get gunky as easy due to the desgin not having as much rubber. They are just so quick to pull out and pop back in with the flick of a finger. Sound quality is bassy but the highs SLIGHTLY compressed and a little staticy on some songs.  Also the buds look nice to me personally.<br><br>Overall I liked the airpods better and I&#39;m an android user. Theyre just so much more slick to open and pop in your ears and seem more responsive to your phone. Theyre very comfortable and one more thing I forgot to mention is the calling sounds better too. My girlfriend complained about the call quality on my galaxy buds and they glitched a lot.
Airpods look awful.<br>Just looks like someone chopped off the wires lol.<br>And they&#39;re massive.<br>And the sound quality is terrible.
Result - can&#39;t decide!
A year later I got &#39;em for 70 bucks (:<br>kids do not drink the cool aid .
I&#39;m an Samsung/Android guy but the Samsung buds are HORRIBLE. The most uncomfortable earbuds I&#39;ve ever used, even the slightest facial movements will cause them to become dislodged so actually using them to let&#39;s say......TALK is difficult at times. All the tech is amazing and convenient but as far as using them for the simple things like a bluetooth device....NO. Too uncomfortable to listen to music for any period of time. Can&#39;t wear them to the gym because rigorous movements will dislodge them. The battery life isnt great and the sound is just okay. I&#39;ve got about 5 different buds/bluetooth devices and I only grab the Samsung&#39;s if every one of those is discharged. I literally have a set of earbuds from Walmart that cost me $35 bucks and they outperform the Samsungs.  By far.
I have been using Galaxy Buds for 10 months , its not a good choice if you want them for phone calls.<br>i havent tried apple buds
Great video guys! Can I use them to workout? I sweat a lot working out and the galaxy buds plus are barely rated IPX2. What do you think? Greetings from Spain üá™üá∏
I choose none: I still using wire earphone cause my wallet doesn‚Äôt allow me to get earbud.
Battery life?
So the Galaxy buds are better. Good to know
when your an apple user with galaxy buds
Samsung : makes wireless ear buds <br>Every company: ok cool <br>Apple : makes wireless ear buds <br>Oral b dental : pfft why wear air pods when u can cut off the top of our automatic toothbrush
So I have airpods now but I think I‚Äôm gonna get the buds because it has many more features, also my dad wants AirPods so that‚Äôs great
and I‚Äôll still have airpods, because those Samsung ones look shite
Amazing background music !
Try using a different gasket on the galaxy ones it might help with the feel
one of the few phone reviewers that actually uses andoid. mad respect
It goes from Idek I&#39;m wearing them  -&gt; idek where I lost them lol
by far the Samsung wins
Samsung earbuds are nice but my right ear bud died within a month!!!!! Disappointed
Let‚Äôs settle this... ok? You like what you like <br>BOOM <br>I personally think Samsung just tried there best to make a better version. Simple
Galaxy Buds for sure
What is your all time favorite earbuds
When I had AirPods they kept falling off but the Galaxy Buds r perfect fit for me
SAMSUNG ALWAYS WINS!!!, EXCEPT!!!!! FOR THEIR FUCKING EXYNOS CHIP!!!!!
Galaxy buds had so many more features, and they were cheaper.<br>Easy pick.
Haha galaxy is just way better<br>Apple has plastic <br>Galaxy has rubber <br>G is way better and even less price!
Phone call usage is very important to me and you never talk about call quality, do people hear you ok. I use my phone constantly for work
Their both equally as ugly why are people trying to compare that but I‚Äôm still going to buy the airpods because they honestly are the same so you might as well just choose which one you want and I want airpods no completion
im using s10+
Easy, just get them both, problem solved
Is the touchpad only on the galaxy buds plus or is it on the normal galaxy buds as well
Samsung: Creates good, underrated phones and everyone hates on it. Also Samsung: Makes better version of airpods and nobody talks about it.<br>Apple: Creates the same phone but just very slightly different design, which people prefer over good phones from Samsung. <br>Also Apple: Makes airpods.<br>Everyone else: Oh mY gOD! THiS iS aMaZinG! So MucH bEtTeR tHaN AnDroID!
Apple came with them first ? Or did samsung?
I would be embarrassed if I owned the Sam sung ones they look like hearing aids lol they ugly
I have a pair called enacfire e18. I am really happy with them, only thing I don‚Äôt like is the case, it‚Äôs to big
iPods hurt my ear.. But I like the sound
I&#39;ve seen galaxy buds on ebay for 50 bucks
Does the App Store for Apple have the galaxy wearable app?? Because I can‚Äôt find it
I think we should all buy Nokia phone speaker
I hate in ears, thats why i choose the airpods  even for jogginf sports whatever and i also habe a samsung mobile. I hate earphones which are going deep in the earcanal, u can hear yourself breathing.
Lol I&#39;m on earphones from Samsung and it good!
Galaxy had the same features that the air pods pros have now
I love the &quot;But they&#39;re uglier&quot; comment I keep seeing... So you&#39;d rather have this lil penis looking like thing on your cheek that an EAR BUD in your ear?! Okay, you win I guess üôÑ
But then the airpods pros come out üòÉ
Yeah airpods just feel great in your ears
My ears start hurting when wearing airpods!:( so I definetely choose galaxy buds.
Sir u should give subtitles. Too on your viedo
Stupid question are the galaxy earbuds compatible with any android phone?
This is a bad thing because they can to fall and u wont even feel it
Thanks brother.  I have the Samsung 10 I&#39;m looking for a perfect pair...
Im an Apple user and want to buy the Samsung buds but the app doesn‚Äôt support this years version üòû
Bang Minta Samsung Galaxy Buds
Me:has galaxy buds and AirPods also me EAR BUDS SRE EAR BUDS
How are the buds sound spectrum and noise canceling compared to the bose qc20 which are my go to headphones
You shouldn‚Äôt have to have the volume on the buds and phone in prefer to enjoy the music
Ok first of all airpods are WAAAAAY MORE LOUDER. <br>I CANT HEAR MY FARTS!!!! <br><br>Galaxy buds. ü§´ü§êüò¥ I can hear a fart.
People like airpod more cause they look cool but samsung one are better
i barely like the buds+ and i like samsung so you know how bad the galaxy buds are compared to the regular airpods
Rubber tipped wireless earbuds üëé
Samsung actually sucks.<br>Apple is expensive but better products.<br>Samsung just good at copying but it still sucks.<br>Samsung is one of the most ugliest phones I‚Äôve ever seen.<br>People say apple sucks and they didn‚Äôt even try it.
These things are killing people slowly
Airpods:Toothbrushes <br><br>Galaxy buds: Mentos <br><br>Choose your pick
Thank you very much, really help me, we are waiting for your next video, keep healthy and keep uploading
I was watching with my AirPods and damn<br>All I can see is Galaxy Bud users shading apple üòî
Airpods more like A**pods
Pink floyd music, to know if the either is good or bad. ikr xD
i have both and i gotta say I don&#39;t see myself reaching for earbuds much. Too uncomfortable for me
Dropped my left AirPod in the tub because I forgot I had them on
i don&#39;t see any comments on here about the quality of sound when you&#39;re talking to someone on the phone...i have both...if i&#39;m not talking on the phone and just want to use them for listening (movies, books, etc.) the samsung are by far the best for all reasons mentioned...BUT for talking to someone one the phone, there is no comparison whatsoever, in that the Apple are the best...Almost EVERYTIME i am on the phone with someone with Samsung buds, someone will eventually say &quot;you went out on me for a second&quot; or &quot;i missed some of what you said.&quot;  I NEVER have that happen with Apple...This is disappointing to me because all other features of the Samsung are better, and I&#39;m also a Galaxy user since the Galaxy even came out years ago...
You can do moth of these with airpods and pros
Can I use the Samsung ones on my iPhone?
You placed the buds in a wrong way tho..
Galaxy buds are better than airpods like it
Galaxy buds

Apple is trash.
I like the Apple air pods because they don‚Äôt go all the way in my ear and they feel good . I have sensitive ears and if ear phones go all the way in my ear canal it‚Äôs just uncomfortable üò£.  Sorry Samsung.
I use my samsung buds at work. U can easily hide them and they do show. While wearing a hoody lol
Apple: more popular and for flexing.<br>Android: For people who prefer quality and don&#39;t want to show off or get robbed.

Galaxy buds look way cooler the Airpods
Do you guys keep all the electronics you guys receive? What do you guys do with them?
IM GETTING THE GALAXY BUDS
Earbuds is better and cheaper.Airpods has lot of sensor problems.
He said unlike the AirPods these have interchangeable your Tips well just wait till the pros
Ummm.... my broke ass here using the wires üòÅ
Nah I&#39;m gonna chill with my pear pods
I‚Äôm dumbfounded , I just purchased a pair of galaxy buds. first off they sounds absolutely disgusting , like I bought them at the family dollar. second they never work at the same time, lefts works then right works it‚Äôs horrible .
I actually think think the Samsung buds are worse because my cousin has them and they sound very echoing
and galaxy buds are cheaper, and you dont need to buy an extra case for wireless charging... samsung is officially better at 90% of things, we just need a better ecosystem and messaging app, and better audio, but the audio is good enough to listen to for a workout, you just zone out anyway
So you used it for min and gave 7 minutes review on product????? Have some respect for viewers fool !!
I tried both and i chose Samsung
I had AirPods Pro
the air pods hurt my ears
So as a user of both........ mmmmmm airpods take the win. I mean galaxy earbuds just dont cut the cheese. They lack the ability to GET LOUD. I can hear my farts at the loudest setting on galaxy earbuds. Airpods I can&#39;t hear NOTHING. The win airpods.
air pods looks like you&#39;re wearing a toothbrush
If you get airpods 2 for 135 $ yes ?????
i have a ring on my s10 case...<br><br><br>crap
Im using galaxy buds
Galaxy buds are alright but definetley needed some work, hopefully the galaxy buds+ are far more improved because the left bud is lower than the right, the right bud is muffled like crazy and its terrible over all
Can you tell me which phone is that you using at this video ?
i tried once airpods and after 15 min of songs it sturted to hurt my ears becouse of cheap plasticüò°
samsung buds are made from design of akg headphones that you get with s10
He played Travis Scottü§ò
Listening to this on my Galaxy Buds...
I heard alot about the caller voice from the budds isnot clear? Is that true??
they both cool don‚Äôt have em but both cool
i have the galaxy buds so i chose them because price.
I‚Äôm an apple user, apple watch, iphone xs max, and ipad, but I chose the galaxy buds over airpods. I prefer the shape, the noise cancellation, and they were cheaper. Airpods don‚Äôt stay in my ear and I dislike that bar that hangs down the outside of your cheek from your ear. If I was looking for super amazing sound I would have gone for Bose over either. But I was just looking to finally get rid of corded headphones, and for the price $120 wasn‚Äôt bad for what I got with the samsung galaxy buds.
Stupid
Can you use the Samsung with a iphone
been an apple user my whole life and i dead ass want a S20 ultra now and galaxy buds to replace my iPhone and air pods. My primary thing holding me back is that people say android is laggy and support isn&#39;t held for as long. I just cant believe the quality that Samsung is producing and the fact that there is literally 99% screen and a tiny dot camera in the front its beautiful. I do love I-message games and face time but realistically idc about face timing people. If someone from Iphone really need to talk to me they could text me or call me. If they realllllyyyyyy wanna see my face and talk get an app that works on both like Skype its not that big of a deal. I dont know im gonna see what Apple can produce in 2020 but if its not in my book better than the S20 Ultra good bye Apple. Anyways id love everyone&#39;s thoughts if you actually read to the end of this enormous paragraph.
Ok everyone here are Samsung fans I love it I haven&#39;t seen apple fans I LOVE SAMSUNG
Shortened<br><br>He prefers galaxy buds for quality, configurations, UI and charging<br><br>He prefers airpods for comfort<br><br><br><br>Conclusion: Galaxy buds win
It&#39;s way too obvious that the galaxy buds are better. Even he knows that, that&#39;s why he chose for a subjective conclusion. Is he would&#39;ve been objective, we all know it&#39;s 100% Samsung.
Next gen will have voice recognition and comands
if I got airpids if I&#39;ve lost them I wouldn&#39;t even notice until later
Good simplified opinion and review
i think you should do galaxy buds+ vs the airpods pro
When I first got my airbuds I like it because of the noise-cancelling feature but it gets tricky with in-car conversation. Then I tinker around a bit and it has ambience mode. Always bring it everywhere afterwards
I literally played 2 songs on the apple airpods and it died
Ima stay with speakers taped to my head.
Apple fans and android fans: Fighting<br>Me with an IPad and Samsung phone: DEVICES ARE DEVICES
Had both , buds are quality
Could you make a video with the galaxy earbuds+?
Apple Air Pods are louder on Iphones. Air Pods on Android/ Galaxy is low. I&#39;m got the Air Pods and I&#39;m so disappointed, but my Dad&#39;s Airpods on his IPhone is louder
You can find one if misplaced from the app?! Dude I&#39;m sold
AirPods look like wireless headphones <br>Galaxy buds looks like your going deaf .. hearing aids
Dam those galaxy buds r ugly üò®üò®üò®
Comment= Samsung earpods<br>Like= Apple airpods
I know I know that the Samsung eirpod has a really great sound
I don&#39;t understand why people choose sides. I am here like should I use airpods to my samsung or should I rock the galaxy buds to my Iphone tomorrow? Like just stfu xD
I have iPhone but I‚Äôm definitely gonna get the Samsung earbuds
It dose have hearing on AirPods
Awesome Samsung nice üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèfollowing the footsteps of Sony ü§®ü§®

How do you connect your airpods to you Samsung
Any others besides these with better sound?
If u wanna be rich get aurpods
Buds is better
It&#39;s like he knows samsung buds did better but he still has hope in airpods lmao
Unbox Therapy and Linus Tech Tips are the only tech youtubers that aren&#39;t obsesed Apple users that don&#39;t just say, without seeing how they perform, that the Air Pods are better than the Galaxy Buds
I have samsung buds 2019 a d i lost the left one ,can i buy left bud and program them together ??
SGB &gt; AP
Remove the fin and it will be really conformable.
The only thing that I like about the air pods is that they are way more comfortable to wear then the galxy buds, the galaxy buds start hurting my ears after wearing them for an hour
Dude, you do an amazing job at describing and explaining each pair of headphones. I&#39;m definitely subscribing.
I have the buds &amp; wish they were louder.
So Samsung is better but Apple is more about flexing.
So basically galaxy buds rape the fuck outta air pods.

Great video!! If you had to choose 1 ear bud with loud amazing sound and great bass, which one would you choose? Thanks for all tour great videos!!
I bought AirPods to be with the trend (had my money and compromised with my mom don‚Äôt judge I have a lot of grandmas) and I use them a lot b I will get so mad if ‚Äúgalaxy buds‚Äù <b>TAKE OVER</b>
Dude, if it&#39;s tight, use one smaller plastic thingys on the buds. Like....bruh.
I just bought the galaxy buds and what a great pair of little earbuds they are great and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t go with the overpriced crap from apple.

samung - quality, apple - just pay for shit like gucci... BOTH are good but just look at the price...

On Both of them, Sound quality is very poor. The bass is flat, no deep listening! I just bought one pair, but I am going to return it right away. <br>People who likes the sounds quality of this product doesn&#39;t has for sure ideia what a good sound quality is. <br>We are paying $130 for a earbuds that sounds like $14. <br>Other wise I found everything fine. <br>But I repeat, THE SOUND QUALITY IS VERY POOR!
Â∑≤ÂÖ•Êâã‰∏âÊòübudsÔºåÁúüÈ¶ô
Just received my earbuds Yesterday. I had seen many comparison reviews and was delighted that the Samsungs always came in first. Opened them up, charged them completely, then paired them with my Samsung TV flawlessly and EXTREMELY easily. Then listened to movie and was severely disappointed that there was virtually NO BASS, volume on the TV (through BT) had to be turned waaaay up so they could be heard (yes, proper fit and silicon ends well shoved into my ears, etc.). Tried them on my iPhone - again, paired without problem - but the sound was horrible; no bass. Tried them on my computer and used it&#39;s graphic equalizer to crank up the bass - still no joy.<br><br><br>I have a set of bluetooth water resistant buds with over the ear hooks and a cable that connects the two through the inline control/microphone. Those do not shove into my ears (which ended up hurting when testing the earbuds) and they have excellent sound production but only about 2 hours of listening time - the kicker is that the ones I have cost about $14 whereas the Samsungs were over $100. <br><br><br>Sorry Samsung (and Apple) - looks like I can stick with the cheap ones that have the two buds wired to each other and have better sound, greater ear comfort and 10% of the cost. Oh, I suppose I&#39;ll lose style points... Maybe I&#39;ll just paint mine white and people won&#39;t know they&#39;re not the name brand versions...
Samsung is that funny guy in the classroom who no one listens to, then Apple take Samsungs joke and everyone laughs at that instead.
Just picked up the Buds with my Note10+...love em and look better to me üòÅ
Kinda funny, he said that the airpods were the &quot;not being able to feel them&quot; setup, as I&#39;m nearly falling asleep with galaxy buds, not being able to fell them at all
im android my entire fam is ios.... i just dont get it ... i can show them my phone does more... and i hear them say hey my phone wont let me do that etc... they all brain washed by apple...... my gf main arguement is well do you have face time? ...............im like no i dont need to because every social media platform has its own video chat anyway AND IF I WANTED VIDEO CHAT I COULD DOWNLOAD ONE OF SEVERAL APPS..... then she said ya but iphone can message on wifi .. me: ya so can android with any app .. android just dont have the app pre loaded....  THEY ARE SO BLIND TO THE TRUTH
If you have a Samsung get galaxy buds or people will roast u<br>If you have apple get AirPods or people will roast u
My galaxy buds , while i calling with someone he tell me i listen annoying sound how i fix this problem ?
Thinking of getting them ü§î
Answer:<br>Galaxy buds are better quality but not as comfy as the AirPods since the Galaxy Buds are more secure.<br><br>if you already have a very good pair of headphones\earphones go with apple but if you have no other very good headphones\earphones, go with apple.

Are air pods pro not just the best???
If my original buds that came with my galaxy s10e don&#39;t fit in my ears does that mean the galaxy buds won&#39;t fit?
Lew looks like a Buddhist monk in airpods..!
I have the s10+ with that exact color
The Galaxy buds ain&#39;t loud all, I don&#39;t want pure audio quality I want some VOLUME!!
What about fake airpods? They are great
He forgot to mention a few things but a big one for me (besides everything else) that makes galaxy buds better is that galaxy buds are also ipx2 certified which means they are water and sweat resistant. Air pods are NOT.<br><br>Tight fit + ipx2 means they will be a good choice for working out. Which means a lot for fitness users.
Well how I see it if you have an iPhone get the AirPods. If you have a samsung get the galaxy buds ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I&#39;m going for Galaxy Buds. Samsung is quality, Apple is flex.
If you want to call somebody switch off Bluetooth remove galaxy buds from ear and speak directly with phone... Samsung galaxy buds don&#39;t know there is one mic in it.
The Buds are much better
Lost my razor pods got a s10+ gonna get the buds nruh

I chose the galaxy buds but I&#39;m finding some discomfort with long term use as I have a tragus piercing, I don&#39;t notice this discomfort using the wired akg earphones that came with my s10. I&#39;m now looking for a wireless option with a similar profile to the akgs
can i have one of your airpods? hope u noticed this comment ü§©
Yeah but it‚Äôs Android
Try kitsound Metro headphones using them rn to watch your video
Galaxy ,, cuz it has ambient sound control cuz without it I could be hit by a car or riding bicycle it is a must option
If you change the wing tips to the one with no wing, you feel them less!
Airpods look like my oral b toothbrush
Galaxy buds are west of money <br>They don‚Äôt provide sound like apple airpod
The apple airpods are too over rated bc its apple
Why do Airpods Fall out? <br>So that you lose them and pay 70 dollars for one again.
what if i want samsung but they gift me airpods :(
Galaxy buds
Simple answer: there both good
I bet Samsung and apple fanboys are coming to the comments just to argue like there both good I honestly like the design of some samsung phones but I like apple because of how good it looks and the performance
Apple Air pods PRO:like.<br>  Galaxy Buds:comment
So rich you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre wearing.
I am listening to it with galaxy buds
I prefer the galaxy buds to the air pods. Galaxy buds is more decent<br>, but air pods look like u are having a pair of cut ear phones in your ears.
Imagine someone working for iPhone uses a Samsung phoneü§£ü§£
WHERE MY AIRPODS GANG AT?
I keep my discreet Samsung buds in dynamic mode at work and couldn&#39;t be happier.
Who made Airbuds first? Samsung or Apple?
nah the casio fx 785 calculater earbuds  are obviously he best
How about we switch it up <br>AirPods: like<br>S Buds: comment
BREDSTIK
Me watches this with AirPods in
I already got AirPods but they on a leash
Is it possible to get the galaxy earbuds app on a samsung Galaxy A10e
I choose neither I walk around with a live band
Are You still a broke boy if You own a galaxy buds?
Lmao u pay less for wires... üòÇ
I have airpods, my brother has galaxy buds and they are Wayyy better. I have to commit
I&#39;m actually using the Galaxy bud right now
How he says Samsung. Samsong.
GalaxyPods: Like<br><br><br><br><br><br>AirPods: Fuck off
Most of the settings on the galaxy buds are on AirPods, you just have to go in the settings app
Wow....I&#39;m so so soooo glad I didnt buy either, if you&#39;re still in the market for decent enough wireless earbuds do what I did and get the jbl 120s which is like $79 and it sounds fantastic better then my uncles Samsung wireless earbuds
So basically, Apple can go screw off!  Great!  That is all I needed to know!
This dude is a whole Samsung fan he didn‚Äôt even really give AirPods a chance
Everyone who said those buds are better than AirPods you dumb you dumb as shit
For me they&#39;re both bad, the Samsung Earbuds are comfy n&#39; stuff but they constantly fall out the case when falling, not to mention it constantly slips out your pocket, (I own a samsung) if Im not mistaken they&#39;re exclusive to Samsung phones, Airpods hurt my ears and aren&#39;t adjustable they&#39;re uncostumizable on android but I mean they are made for their OS so that&#39;s understandable, the case is small and slippery, and thats why I prefer Bose Sportswear
Most times I double or triple click my bluetooth headset or headphones dials 911.  <br>I&#39;m always having to explain to operator that it was a mistake.  is anyone else has this issue?
I want samsung!!!!!!!
Airpods better
i was watching this video wearing the galaxy buds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=304">5:04</a> <br>Is the musical refrence of josuke&#39;s stand crazy diamond
Everyone prefer galaxy buds but can&#39;t choose between them cause you can flex with airpods
unbox be like you can have one earbud charging and one playing for the samsung<br><br>airpod users wow ours can do that to suprise suprise
Hey hey use the AirPods pro STOOPID
What&#39;s the song in the background? When he listens to them
Well I have Samsung so I went for the buds
Maximum volume?? U tryna kill yer own  ears? U deaf now??
ngl, i got my first airpods a few months ago and I kinda regret it now. should have gotten galaxy buds, they were the same price :(
I&#39;ve putting buds right now
The galaxy buds probably sound and work better, but the AirPods have a better and more iconic look, even if they look like shrek ears
Song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=257">4:17</a> ? ? ? ?
Apple sucks Samsung is a glory
i hate how airpods have such little configurable options
Galaxy buds
galaxy earbuds doesn&#39;t work if you put your phone in your pant&#39;s front pocket. It&#39;s shit.
I have a note 10+ and a note 9 for work. Am I  able to pair one bud for one phone and the other bud for the other phone?
Linus said air puds lew says earpuds
Earpieces suck they feel so uncomfortable AirPods rule thumbs up for airpods
I actually have both. The Galaxy buds really hurt my ears and give me headaches.
I‚Äôm on IOS and I love the Samsung buds
Agreed. Buds do hurt your ear sometimes. But considering safety and sound base. I still go for galaxy buds
I am watching with AirPods
Xiaomi buds
Samsung is underrated
Buy skull candy literally the best for wireless and sound quality
For my birthday I got a phone and Christmas I got airpods
Well no I can&#39;t pick one, because I use galaxy S10 and loves everything about Galaxy Buds but Airpods feels better when you wear it which I really like...<br><br><br><br>*Edit: I decided to get a wired one instead of wireless ones. I&#39;m tired of suffering from making choices
i think you are wearing the Galaxy buds are wrong. once you put them in your ear, you can rotate them forwards and that ear lock thing will slide right behind a part of the ear. this prevents them from being knocked out if being hit. however, if your ears are on the smaller side, they will hurt after an hour or two of wearing them like this, which is a simple fix, as you can just rotate them backwards and wear them normally. also, you can change the configuration of the bud so that their is no ear lock. anyway, i feel the quality, customization, anfeel of the buds are a lot better.
Galaxy buds
I don&#39;t regret my so expensive Galaxy Buds, they&#39;re worth it
Galaxy ear nuds smell a little bit wierd
I probably prefer the galaxy buds as I have a samsung phone.... but a friend gifted me airpods.... I won&#39;t be able to use the full capability of the airpods just because my phone isn&#39;t an apple one.... but it is the thoughts that count
For Me Airpods Is Better Because Airpods Is Very Easy To Charge<br><br>sorry If You Don‚Äôt Agree With me
I don‚Äôt any ear buds I listen to music in public out loud
Android buds are for people who lack on standards but the real people here get AirPods cuz there rich asf
What&#39;s the app called?
Just got the Samsung plugs. Sound is terrible! It sounds like the sound is comming out of a tin can. No bass or any warmth in the sound.<br>Don&#39;t know if the apple plugs sound any better but i have the cheap wired apple headplugs and the sound is much much better. Even my 20 year old Sony Ericsson wired plugs sound better than the recent Samsung plugs, wired or not... <br>I love all my samsung stuff like my phones, galaxy watch, galaxy tablet etc, but the audio stuff they create is pure shit!üí©üí©üí©
I have a samsung but i use airpods
AirPods are trash the galaxy buds are good
I think ill stick to my 20$ Sports buds that do perfect for me

I dont think people are asking which one they should get, if they have iphone they get airpod, if they have samsung they get galaxy bud. Thanks for the video tho
Who is watching this with galaxy pods on?
AirPods my dude
I fully agree, I am a die hard Samsung fan, but for every day use I want something that sounds good but doesn&#39;t give me ear fatigue after an hour.

Airpod is fugly as hell
Samsung makes all right

You don‚Äôt want to be caught with those
Galaxy buds has so much more specs<br>Unbox theory: i like airpods because i cant feel it  up in me ear cannal
Apple: We made wireless ear buds<br><br><br><br><br>Samsung: <b>Does same thing but better</b><br><br><br><br><br>Apple, months later: So we made new air pods that are uglier and do the same thing as the Galaxy Buds.
could you do a review on the jbl Tune 120 TWS and the jbl Reflect Flow ?????
Samsung Buds have more umph, more configurablity, wireless charge on the phone, better sound isolation, are cheaper.<br><br>Lewis: &quot;That is a hard pick&quot;<br><br>Really? Pander to Apple fanboys much mate?
I got both and use them both regularly. honestly, the galaxy buds are better. if I&#39;m working, I can turn on ambient sound, and if I&#39;m sleeping, I can use the sound seal to my advantage to cancel the noise.
Hello unbox therapy, question: Will the Samsung air buds pair with my galaxy note 5?
Lmao wired earphones gang, too broke for either.
Galaxy buds reign supreme over airpods. Airpods are just a &#39;flex&#39;.
I recently returned my Galaxy buds after having them for two weeks. They are very comfortable without the ear tips, and sound great. I returned them because the left bud would stop working from time to time, and I couldn‚Äôt use the Galaxy gear app with my phone. So I figured it would be better to stick with something that was made for iPhone. Now my original AirPods sounds good, but I was afraid they would hurt my ears and I was right!!üôÑüôÑ they are very very uncomfortable!!! So I just might get the AirPods pro.
Did Nike pay u to wear nike hat ?

Galaxy buds
I would choose Samsung buds because if you don‚Äôt feel it you won‚Äôt get to know if it fell
I dont care how much better the galaxy is over the airpods. They can have rockets and can make you fly. At the end of the day my man im choosing the airpods
Apple? Hahaha! Samsung? Pshhhh! I got me some SOULJAPODS
Airpods look so STUUUUUUUUUUuuuupiddddd though.
Listening with galaxy buds

The only problem I have with the buds is that when I move my ears they become loose and i have to constantly adjust them to messsge sure they don&#39;t fall out.
How many did the Samsung costs? Because I want to buy them.And you are the best üëç
Watching this with my galaxy buds.<br>They&#39;re pretty good and really fit in my ear, nice sound quality.I can shake my head and it stay there.Pretty good and very comfortable for me.
I had some but I never opened it I gave them away because I had a iPhone, you&#39;re loosing alot when you don&#39;t have the app downloaded IMO.
Galaxy ambient mode is quite shitty. You cant here shit. When music is 100% volume you cant hear shit. Unless there is a hidden setting.
The ambient feature is useful, I just wish it faded the sound out into the ambient feature... I think if you need to hear outside you shouldn&#39;t need to still hear music ect.. I use them in the kitchen, two clicks and I can hear everything and it&#39;s nice but a fade into the surrounding would be nice..
I agree with you on everything but in my opinion I like the buds better, they fit in my ear better, lower price, and the airpods hurt my ears if I keep them on most of the time
Apple headphones have always hurt my ears after awhile and I hate that they never bothered changing the design
Can you review the bt21 wireless earbuds plz ü•∫
Sony noise cancelling: bitch hold my beer
Can you see the battery life of the airpods on samsung
I think overall the galaxy buds are the better. They sound slightly better. They , in my opinion look better. They&#39;re more practical and fit better. Airpods are more likely to fall out of the two. However in fairness both are pretty decent in their price range. So you won&#39;t be disappointed which ever you chose. However for real audiophiles, you need to look elsewhere. There&#39;s way way way better out there. But you pay for the better sound. Then there&#39;s the echo buds which are also worth a look.
<b>LIKE BELOW... FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY EARBUDS</b>
I turned in the airpods for a pair of Samsung ear buds. Better fitting, sound quality, and all that it features.
Unlike air pods they have cusions<br><br>Airpods pro: Let me introduce myself
If you care more about &quot;looking cool&quot; than having quality ear buds. Get the air pods
Samsung I would say has better sound quality and more customization
Bruh the airpods are smaller
hahahah you noob i have wireless charging airpods you fucking poor piece of shit
Try realme true wireless
You can use use one AirPod at a time as well
Be honest, galaxy buds are fkn ugly
They are the best
Samsung buds
Samsung: look what i made<br>People:<br>Apple: i made the same thing but it costs more <br>People: take my money
What about airpod strap? Heard about them? Try to search it.
Buds were around before pods
Comment section when Samsung does it better: woW Samsung iS Sooo mUcH better! ApPLE sUckS!<br><br>Comment section when Samsung does it better: lol yall such apple sheep!
Ngl the yellow ones are gonna make apple lovers say &quot;aTlEaSt AiR pOdS DoNt lOok LiKe EaR wAx!!!&quot;
People just choose apple to fit in with everyone else and most of them think they&#39;re the only good phones on the market that&#39;s why apple has more sales. They target mainly the teens because every teen wants to fit in and have the best phone üòÇ so that&#39;s why people choose apple a lot. I&#39;m always Android no matter what‚ô•Ô∏è
Watching on a iPhone listening with galaxy ear buds.
ARE YOU AN APPLE GUY OR AN SAMSUNG
i wore my friends airpods once and they honestly hurt my ear ._.
<b>EAR TAMPON</b>
Samsung Buds are obviously better.  Besides, I don&#39;t have balls to walk around with a ear tampon lol
Yeah, but with AirPods you look cooler and Samsung no offence to the Samsung users.. but kinda look lamr
wait my airpods work if im just using one, and i can see the charge of the individual pods plus the case
&quot;The Samsung Buds can charge wirelessly FROM your phone, also the app gives you a lot of configurability, also they have a tight fit so you&#39;re confident they don&#39;t fall off. ALSO they are cheaper than the Apple Airpods... But man it&#39;s a hard pick which is better...&quot;
Amazingly helpful! Thank you.
Airpods look like ur a dumb dude with half cigarettes sticking out your ears.
You could get a ball for dat price
I&#39;ve tried/tested both I&#39;d totally recommend the Galaxy Buds IDK why people keep buying Apple products most of them are not even worth their price and let&#39;s not talk about their recycled phones.
They need to stop stealing from Apple

Apple AirPods&#39; kids:Yo look how rich I am I don&#39;t speak to poor little kids.<br><br><br>Samsung AirBuds&#39; Kids: Well we don&#39;t speak to kids wearing cancerous radiational Bluetooth headphones
Samsung: Here&#39;s ambient sound mode<br><br><br>People: Okay neat<br><br><br>Apple a few months later: Here&#39;s the same thing with a different name<br><br><br>people: WoAH ThiS Is ReVOluTioNaRy<br><br><br>(Don,t kill me this is a joke)
This is the &quot;I dont even notice I&#39;m wearing them&quot; headset, which also means you wont be able to tell if they drop out!üò±
I do agree with that the airpods are not noticeable but that can be a bad thing. If you loose one on a bus and you wouldn&#39;t notice it would pop out then that wouldn&#39;t be so great but what is good about the airpods is the tracking system.<br><br>I haven&#39;t tried the galaxy buds yet but as I am so used to the AKG wire earbuds i will go for the samsung one. not that i have anything against the airpods
Apple: see we so much better<br>Samsung: ummm mind checking the price?
I bet you 90% of the people will still buy the airpods instead of samsungüòÇ
I‚Äôm on iOS and I‚Äôm using the galaxy ones
Everytime I see someone wearing a square faced watch I instantly start looking for the &quot;Asshole Trendy Sticks&quot; in their ears. Lol
Not trying to be rude but i think u speak to fast
Apple fans: SaMsUnG fAnBoYs ArE sO tOxIc NoWüòÇ üòÇ<br>Me in my mind: I don&#39;t give  a damn about it. EARPHONES ARE JUST EARPHONES
He&#39;s got a pretty awesome beard.
I enjoy the Nokia air doots
My old school wired beats bitch slap those 2
Dislike people trying to be funny doing a review. But I do appreciate the rest of the information. Thank you
Galaxy Buds are better in every way, and are mush cheaper. Also has a much better design.
can it be connected to samsung j8? ( j8 bluetooth version 4.2) please currect answer.Galxy buds
How do you play music on one of the Samsung buds and charge the other because mine won&#39;t do that üò™
Make another video but with the AirPods pro
Idk why I&#39;m watching this, I literally carry both In my pocket on any given day
can i get the app on ios?
Galaxy buds
Samsung for my Google pixel 2!!!
I have a galaxy s8, will I get the full use out of these or are there things I will be missing out on?
you wear the buds wrong!! you must put it to the ear and then  rotate around under the ear! and they will never fall of your ears
Isn‚Äôt feeling the galaxy buds in your ears an advantage.<br><br>Because If you rarely feel the air pods, then when your AirPod falls down, you won‚Äôt notice that that happened but if you feel the galaxy bud, then when it falls of, you will notice that it dropped from your ear.
Does the galaxy buds     stay in when you dont have ear canals
My mom has Galaxy buds and I tried them out they&#39;re really good except for me they don&#39;t fit airpods to me fit much better
Can you get the Galaxy Buds app on iOS?
Hey dummy, they have to fit snug to isolate sound.
I will never like Apply products. Never will I buy anything from them. BUT! If it wasn&#39;t for Apple and their innovations.... Samsung would have kept us with slow phone&#39;s like the touch pro 1 or touch pro 2. So good job apple.
so which one doesnt fall out when doing cardio?
I&#39;m listening to this video with galaxy buds
Galaxy buds are better in features and airpods are overrated, I recommend Apple to make a AirPod app and make more settings and options for airpods
Samsung and apple...<br>Samsung is comfortable/ cheap than apple<br>Apple is great to listen sound
What app is this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=275">4:35</a> Sanju Baba üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
WAIT so youre telling me that Samsung Had noise cancellation, and silcone adujstable tips ALREADY. Apple is so behind
Air pod
One or the other you have to be copying off each other
Samsung: makes comfortable ear buds.<br>Apple: We‚Äôre listening...
Good vid tnx made my choice! Samsung it is! goas well with a s10+
i was watching this with galaxy buds
AirPods are trash
Still worth buying?
Galaxy buds is awensome...
Villagers be like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=238">3:58</a>
But do they pass the pillow test?
Samsung Buds
I call the galaxy buds ‚Äúoogle boogles‚Äù idk why lol
Air pods have the best ambience sound
If you dont notice your wairing them than its easyer to loose
The thing is,  you&#39;re wearing them wrong..the plastic on the side should go right behind your inner ear
Is samsung buds has a voice control of bixby?
Now the new AirPod pro has the rubber ear piece so it can be customized.  I am an apple you.  I have had numerous galaxy phones and they are good but any phone that uses another companies software isn‚Äôt going to run the greatest.  That is why I like the iPhone so much.  Apple makes it all.  Hardware and software.  Every apple product I have works amazingly well.  I have a 2015 Mac book pro and it will still outrun many of the newer windows based laptops.  But I ain‚Äôt one of the idiots that bash one or the other.  Choose whatever you like.  I‚Äôm sure both of these are great products.
Pods pro is better in all aspects but it better damn well be it cost 200 MORE THAN THE FKING BUDS
Galaxy buds look like something sid from ice age would wear
Galaxy buds be lookin like hearing aids
Anyone realize there‚Äôs no music playing
Omg are you kidding me you said Samsung has better everything but the sir pod feels a little bit better in the ear and u didn&#39;t know what to choose are u kidding me everything was better about the Samsung Budd and just because I air pod feels a bit better u like it more wtf is thus
Bro if you put airpod for more than 1 hour it painss...it is really annoying.....but Samsung Buds are awesome ‚ù§‚ù§
Tried flicking out my friends airpods out of her ear with no issues. She tried it with mine and mine are snug like a bug. Samsung buds üëç
Who else is watching while using Galaxy Buds?,
Well, the airbuds just exploded (dislocated) while listening to music
I have a small ear...which one should I get
In my opinion u can&#39;t flex with samsung buds.
Apple sucks
Um i have a question, so the samsung work on all android devices, right? or only for samsung products?
Any news on a galaxy bud 2.0, cause i dont want to buy it and then a couple months later the new one comes out
If you want to waste your money on a overpriced piece of plastic go with the airpods <br>If you want to get true wireless amazing sounding earbuds go with the Samsung buds<br>Your choice
If u did not notice it on ur ears  while u wear it and then say good bye if u lose it unnoticed.
The Galaxy buds have terrible sound quality compared to AirPods!
Thank you for your review.  I think convience will be my buying factor. But comfort and fit is a big deal as most ear buds do not fit well for me. The fact that samsung has different tips may help me as well.
Me: ‚ÄúWho SLAMS there AirPods case!?‚Äù<br>Celebrities: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm RICH!!!‚Äù
So should I get the airpods or the buds?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=104">1:44</a> when i was 6

Im listening to this video using my Samsung Galaxy Buds ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
üíØüíØüíØüíØ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
Could atleast tell us that we haft to download 2 apps ffs
I want to habe the quality of the Galaxy Buds but the airpods fit perfectly in my ear and it&#39;s as if I&#39;m not wearing anything...
Samsung is the better phone
i would choose galaxy buds
üçé
I bought both the Jabra 65t Elite Active and Apple AirPod 2. The Jabra was better in every conceivable way except one: ear comfort. In ear buds have never been comfortable for me and the Jabras like the galaxy buds just weren‚Äôt comfortable, at best I could keep them in for an hour. The AirPods pro are extremely comfortable on the other hand but I‚Äôm not gonna pay even at the Costco discount price the cash Apple wants for the audio quality it puts out. I‚Äôm not even audiophile but even I‚Äôm able to distinguish the difference between AirPods and Jabra. <br><br>The only reason I bought and kept the AirPods is for the comfort. I wish they felt more secure but they‚Äôve only ever fallen out of my hands, not so much my ears. But man do I wish those Jabras were comfortable. They were clutch. -mind you I haven‚Äôt used Bose or Sony headsets.
Full volume?? This man just destroyed his hearing
The new airpods copied the samsong pods!
Is all the settings for the galaxy buds only for samsung phones??
Who is listening to this with airpods or Galaxy Budd in right now like if true
&quot;The fit and the feel, and the sound seal.&quot;üî•üî•üî•üòÇ
You have a fan on your camera???
Ur a good man for choosing samsung
I have had both I had Airpods first and then just got some Galaxy Buds and the Buds are significantly better!! Better sound, they fit better in your ears, cheaper and already come with a wireless charging case as the single option
I use airpods for Android
I have small ears and the airpods fit nice in my ear
What about AirPods pro
Airpods=Flex<br>Galaxy Buds=Good Quality
I&#39;m just going to leave my input.<br><br>Apple is a scummy company, sorry to break it to you. They make mediocre products for people who are blindly loyal to their company. That&#39;s how they make money. I have gone through a fair amount of the comments and most arguments against samsung do not give reasons as to why airpods are better. If you want an argument to be valid, include evidence next time. Many people flock to apple because its accessible, but I bet you they never considered why its accessible. Its accessible because  its generally for people who dont want to read specs and just want the product. And dont go commenting: &quot;I read specs all the time and I use airpods.&quot; Because if you actually did then I&#39;m fairly sure you wouldn&#39;t buy apple most of the time. I&#39;m just saying apple always goes for looks and sleekness over practicality which if you&#39;re a smart consumer is just plain dumb.
Why do you need ambient sound on earpods? They are from plastic and you can hear everything around you.üòÇ
Honestly both of them are good. I personally would go with the Galaxy buds though. I prefer the in ear seal they give, vs the the just sit in your ear feel from the airpods. With that also comes the noise canceling fact. Also if you have a Samsung device, that&#39;s a big plus. For me though airpods just don&#39;t fit my ears very well.
Great review ngl
Maybe you notice the galaxy bud more because you&#39;re not used to it yet...
You did it wrong you must turn on your dolby atmos for max sound
Hi
Just got my Galaxy buds and they sound like toy earbuds. I also can&#39;t hear any difference in ambient sound mode. Glad I didn&#39;t pay full price. Update: I put the bigger ear tips on them and they sound pretty good now
SAAMMMSSSSUUUUUNNNNNNGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!
I like bass like the sound of the beats by Dre x not the wireless the ones with the wires super loud alot of bass i use them when I ride my motorcycle and damn I feel like I&#39;m inside the club so if the Galaxy buds got bass like that I want them lol
With AirPods you can use one of them while the other is charging too
just use the one that comes with that particular PHONE.<br>SIMPLE!!!
Maybe samsung is better
Galaxy buds just made some apple users feel stupid and feel stuck in a diff eco system.
They&#39;re giving the Samsung ones away with Samsung phones at carphone warehouse, every now and then
I have a s10 plus and airpods but I regret buying airpods I want the buds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=195">3:15</a> me when I have my AirPods Pro in and didn‚Äôt hear what someone said to me
AirPods Pro is king
Galaxy buds for the win.
I have a s10 and I chose AirPods because Samsung buds hurt my ears
Lewis: ‚ÄúWireless charge sharing‚Äù<br><br>Me: Its reverse wireless charging
The bass is there if you toggle the bass to high in sound settings. It sounds flat if you turn bass boat in the app you have to turn it up in sound settings also
plz review the audio technica truly wireless earphones cos i think they&#39;re a bit of a hidden gem
the one time apple makes a product with a decent audio codec and samsung is still somehow better
Dose the galaxy earbud APP support apple
Can Galaxy buds be used with Bluetooth 4.2
I&#39;ll just stick to my ones with wires and I have my note 10+
Can I get the galaxy buds app on iOS
Im planning to buy new wireless earphones or earbuds. Im confused between Samsung Galaxy Buds or the ones from JBL. Can someone recommend? Heheh thank youuuu üòä
Are the galaxy earbuds wind resistant and noise cancelling ?
Now that the AirPods 2 are out it‚Äôs funny too see how all of the things that the galaxy buds did better than AirPods the AirPods 2 has fixed and implemented
My problem is, i think i have tiny ears. My friend has airpods and i really wanted them too and we shared them at her place while chilling. After half an hour i couldnt take it anymore, my ear just hurt and it wasnt comfortable at all. Ive always been better with in-ear earphones (the normal AKG ones that come with any samsung phone are amazing for example no pain nothin) so i thought aye the samsung ones should be good then but they look kinda...big xD im scared to get them and cant use them either due to pain :/, any experiences?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=126">2:06</a> people refuse to believe that galaxy buds came with &quot;transparency mode&quot; before airpod pros
The battery life which one is better?
So, Samsung just loves copying
Can you review the raycon wireless earbuds?
When I hear the fantastic sound of this Unbox Therapy video through my wired samsung headphones I forget about the topic!
I&#39;ve both and I can definitely say that airpods have much better sound quality but the galaxy buds have better sound cancellation and isolation but really lacks bass
Hey if you need them üòä buy both, and if can&#39;t afford to pay for it, get the fake ones, same S**t
Soulja Pods guys!!
And my friends with airpods will still make fun of me even though their only like 30 bucks cheaper
Apple: makes AirPods <br><br><br><br>Android: write that down write that down
Who the fuck would use galaxy pods they look like fuckin hearing aids
for me also i think airpods look lil stupid
I love EarPods üéß
Samsung is just following apple and there just copying them <br>Like just<br><br>STOP
To anyone who has samsung: are the buds too chunky?
In his last video reviewing just the airpods, he said it&#39;s all about his reaction. He definitely reacted more positively with the Samsung buds.
As stupid as that looks xD
Okay so clearly the Samsung buds are better but can someone confirm that these features (like ambient sound) are available on iPhones too?
Am i the only one who use the fake airpod
do airpods pro review!! but in flight test!
No fucking conclusion in the end.
The reason why I bought airpods 2 is.....shit!!! cause i am a show off..I know Samsung is better but I just want to show people that I am rich..actually my dad bought my airpods so basically I am not even employed ü§£
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=257">4:17</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=260">4:20</a> smell the fart acting
I would rather use the airbuds because of the ambient and you can charge it with ya phone lol
Bottom line is: If you want to get the best sound out of your buds, you skip the phone branded ones and go buy a pair thats made my real music companies such as bose, sony, and sennheiser. But if you‚Äôre a hipster who likes to hangout at starbucks then go ahead and buy airpods. They‚Äôre used for that purpose anyway.
I‚Äôm having a hard time deciding on these
Honestly, I wish they made the earbuds that come with the Samsung phones wireless. Just like Airpods, it&#39;s just the buds without the wire
Finally someone who‚Äôs is compare airpod and the galaxy bud.thank for the content bro
And now that Airpods Pro are released galaxy fans are still salty asf üòÇ
The buds look like you have cotton wall in your ear it‚Äôs so gross
Apple lovers are going to hate this video... Because of some secret that I know.üòÅüòÅüòÅ
Android or sumsung as you call is copying apple greatest innovation for rich people. Sumsung made a cheap airpods for poor people innovation
What don‚Äôt headphones was he on about
Try the new AirPods2 pro
I have both. The Galaxy Buds are night and day better sounding than Airpods. It&#39;s not even a competition. The feel imo is also better but that&#39;s subjective and the price and features are just better too. $149.99(buds) vs $229.99(pods) where I live. Also, the buds use Type-C and have wireless charging, the airpods don&#39;t have either. <br><br>My only gripe about the buds is the case and while it isn&#39;t a huge issue and it still very small, the airpods case is more comfortable when thrown into a front pocket vs the buds case.
Literally the samsung buds are the new airpods pro
There just to chep to Buy the wire
Just about every single thing about the samsung buds were copied..NOTHING original..as usual.
Samsung earbuds
now there&#39;s the airpods pro
You get used to the buds to the feel of the buds pretty quickly
Now you have the one from google to compare
I don‚Äôt have a buds and AirPods so I don‚Äôt care rich one both r cool
Fun fact :<br>99% of Korean adore air pods while other foreigners find galaxy buds much better. lol
How is the battery life on the Samsung buds?
I would <b>definitely</b> get the Samsung ones. My friend had airpods and let me try them out, and THEY WOULD NOT STAY IN MY EAR! Plus, the extra thing that makes it rest in your ear better work magic. Plus, (again)  there&#39;s more features for them and they are cheaper. <br><b>Congratulations, you heard my review</b>
My phone slipped outta my pocket 2 times in the bus and now when I get out but forget to check if I got it, I know I got it for sure because the music playing in my wired earphones. But imagine not having wires...
I  disagree with Louis‚Äô sound decision... have both and I love them both but for sound quality the AirPods sound a lot better but when it comes to features and accessories the Galaxy Buds won. <br><br>Personally I‚Äôd choose the AirPods because of the better sound but if you like features and stuff you could check out the Galaxy Buds :)<br><br><br>Hope this helps somebody make a decision :)
The dislikes are from Apple users
What about both
Not sure if I missed your review, Can one Samsung Bud work independently or two have to work at the same time. Can the left or right be on while the other one is charging? Thanks
Who‚Äôs watching with AirPods???
I&#39;m a Galaxy buds boi I own them who else?
Just curious, what icon pack is he using on his S10?
A new challenger appears<br><br><br><br><br>Sony wireless buds
Can I use Samsung buds with iphone??
The buds look a bit wierd tho.....
this guy has to be the most annoying famous person I&#39;ve ever seen on youtube
I cant use the apple Airbus because they dont stay in my ears but samsung earbuds stay amazingly well. Love them.
So how do you turn the buds up to full volume cause the volume sucks to me
I have an android and I have airpods ü§£
AirPods: like<br><br><br>Galaxy Buds: reply
Is the galaxy good for talking ?
I like the samsung
Can please you send me that
You can try some redmi airdots
Are you <b>tired</b> of losing your wireless earphones? Don‚Äôt worry! Put a leash on it! The leash connects the earphones to the phone‚Äôs headphone jack.
I just got the pixel 4 yesterday, can you do the configurations with the Galaxy buds on the pixel or not that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna make my decision
Great. Why are you not testing the airbud with an apple phone and the galaxy with the samsung
What you get with:<br><br>Galaxy Buds: <br>Wireless Charging, Noise Isolating Sound, Ambient Sound, Customizable Controls, Built In App<br><br>Airpods:<br>...
The yellow Galaxy buds really sold me.
Leave a like of listening w AirPods üëÄ
AirPods Pro are on the way.
Hurry up hurry up hurry up
Can anyone confirm if either one of the se wireless headphones work with Alcatel flip phones(Alcatel Go)? My grandpa can never hear me on his flip phone when I call. Please let me know!
So basically if you work in an office airpods would be better then  buds.<br>If your work involves something physical then buds are better then airpods.
Which one has a better microphone for talking?
I have tried airpods and galaxy buds in my galaxy S8 and they provide a below average sound quality and as per the people in Samsung store galaxy buds only provide its best in S10 &amp; Note 10 models.  . Is it true??
They look like armor in minecraft
Someone stole my earbud, I ran after him, pushed him on the ground and kicked him in the nuts. I got it back
Idk I have an iPhone 8 and am considering the Samsung one. Mainly because AirPods don‚Äôt fit my ear well and also hurt my ears after wearing for a long time.
Didn&#39;t know you could use the air pods with galaxy phones. üòÖüëç
Literally no one is going to charge their galaxy buds from their phone
airpods look less weird
Apple: AIRPODS IS THE BEST WIRELESS EARPHONES<br><br>Samsung: BET
Ima use galaxy buds so they dont fall out and ambient so i can hear the teacher talking
Airpods makes you looks stupid, Buds makes you look disabled.  Which one will you choose?
Plus the Galaxy ear buds are locatable with the app!<br>That in itself is amazing!
I&#39;m getting the galaxy buds with my tab s6 but I currently use the Marley Liberate Air
Samsung Buds because I have them they are the best
Galaxy buds win. Airpods look retarded with their long rat tails
You get a thumbs up just for playing stargazing by Travis Scott
like they say the original is always better then the imitation
I was watched this full video wearing earpods üòÇüòÇ
Flex with pods<br><br><br><br>Quality with buds
I been using AirPods for my Nokia
Going for comfort and sound, i heard airpods are average to the joe on the sound.
Who watches this video with his/her AirPods?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=353">5:53</a> but the problem of not feeling it, is what if the airpod fell out of your ear? U wouldnt notice because you dont FEEL it. But the buds are more noticeable cause you know when it falls out. My friend once lost her airpod cause she didnt notice it fell out. Earbuds all the way!!!
I would pick samsung because i would want to feel it incase it falls off and its cheaper
Airpods
<b>The fit, the feel, the sound and seal</b><br><br><br>Is this guy a poet now
Either have something like white sperm dripping out, or white sperm frozen in
i love the airpods case want it bad lol
He acts like our iPhones can‚Äôt tell us the battery of each AirPod and thinks our AirPods don‚Äôt work individually
Galaxy
What about battery life?
People say that you can loose your airpods and don&#39;t even mention it. So +1 to buds on this one ;)
People going in for galaxy buds, lol
Unn I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t hear you video...nah I. Just joking with you üòÑüòÑ nice video also galaxy buds
I think samsung is the dominant tech company<br>Does apple make washing machines? No.<br>Does google make washing machines? Still no.
I&#39;m watching this with my samsung buds on.
Galaxy samsung stay copying apple
Literally the only reason I thought airpods is because of the snappy lid , it&#39;s just so satisfying and before you say I&#39;m an isheep I use an s9+ so yeah they are cool
Which one? <br><br>Like AirPods comment earbuds
idk why there&#39;s arguing. Some people prefer samsung, some people prefer android and some people prefer apple. I don&#39;t think theres anything wrong with that.
um i want galaxy buds i can also hear what the others are wispering about me
Due to the discomfort I exchanged my Galaxy buds for the AirPods for my Samsung. Download the Podroid app and you&#39;re set..They sound better too...best decision I made
Airpods!
that look way better than airpod
When I got my Galaxy Buds, I thought they were super quiet but then I pushed up the volume... They are perfect.
If you wanna spend more money and look rich for worse wuality choose air pods. If you would like good quality. For less money choose galaxy buds
Is the range good? I like charging my phone upstairs whilst listening to music on my beats solo 3 downstairs. Atleast 10 metres would be good
he&#39;s listening to shine on you crazy diamond üíô floydüíô
Lue has the best job in the world he is able to review the latest tec an probably has a huge pile of smart phones and Head set&#39;s and laptops in the corner. <br>HILARIOUS IF YOU THINK ABOUT ITüòÇüòÇüòÇ
So I got the galaxy buds and at 1st i thought they fit well but then i thought of testing a different rubber combination after several trials i found out that i was living in pain and they do fit very well and i  now forget im wearing then on! also u didnt test out the mic for the calls and which one of them is better. I think u must take ur time trying the product for a week or so.. It will help evaluate better.<br><br>Thanks love ur channel
Not even a comparison in terms of design or sound quality. The Galaxy buds are miles better than the airpods which sound like earpods with no wire.
Samsung galaxy buds are the best
Apple: we introduce you Toothbrush<br>Idiots: im gonna put that in my ear
How many splinters have you got in your arse sitting on that fence? Ha ha
If you like this comment nothing will happen<br><br>But like it please I&#39;m desperate
Like: galaxy bud <br>Comment :Airpod
Then give me that samsung buds to meüòÖ
team samsung
apple
AirPods cuz I have them
AirPods are great but there‚Äôs  just one thing that disappoints me about the Apple AirPods.... they‚Äôre NOT loud ENOUGH! Lol
Watching this with my AirPods lmao
Im not sure which one I&#39;m gonna take.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Oh i forgot i am broke
Galaxy buds have the galaxy wearable app for any phone which works great (even a non-samsung phone) but airpods don&#39;t have that app if you want to use it  for a phone other than iOS
Galaxy buds are way better  bu far
AirPods<br>Because they‚Äôre the original
The samsung galaxy buds are better but if u feel like trying to flex your money go for the airpods although they aren&#39;t as good pls stop being delusional apple fanboys the airpods are just overpriced for the mediocre performance they offer.
Someone tell me why the airpods are more expensive but the galaxy buds are better?
some of the stuff is not true. for example the AirPods do have that ambient sound future and you can use only one AirPods at a time if u want to...
I&#39;ll admit, I do like the galaxy buds better but I only bought the apple ones to flex on those broke bitchesüòÇüíÄ
Galaxy buds are more sophisticated
I have galaxy s10 but I am thinking to buy Airpodsüòë. The only problem is that they are not really compatible with Samsung devices.<br>Which one should I buy?
There tiny thats a joke i play with legos imagine my life
Best site to buy fake Samsung buds on?? I live in Europe
And Samsung wins again
Samsung, hands down!!! Love the buds in that AURA GLOW.  especially since they DON&#39;T offer the NOTE 10+ 512GB MODEL IN AURA GLOW!  I was forced to get the Note 10+ in black (it&#39;s only made in black) when I really wanted it in that fantastic Aura Glow!!<br>The airpods look ridiculous when worn.  What&#39;s with the &quot;stick&quot;?  Apple has never made an earpod that actually stayed in my ear.  Samsung always fits just right.
I personally only use samsung products, EXCEPT for their earbuds i use airpods. Because the samsung earbuds are trash and i dont mean the sound quailty i mean the way the fit is the most uncomfortable feeling ever. Airpods are far more comfortable, but i use galaxy watch and galaxy phone so yeah.....
Airpods definetly
Who&#39;s like me watching on Galaxy Buds
Are buds working on every type of samsung?
as stupid as that looks......dddddwlllwwwwwwwwwlllllllllllllll

I wouldnt prefer anything because...<br><br>I cant even afford it
Hmm this prove android id stealing tech to make better
Summary<br><br>Galaxy buds if you want really nice comfortable better sound quality and lots of cool features chose these and if you need to save money.<br><br>Airpods if you wanna flex
So which is the winner.
I like how Samsung kids are tryna have a decent conversation and Apple kids are being toxic
Idk about the ipods being less noticeable, it looks like a long ass thing coming out of your ear. If you&#39;re sneaking it I definitely feel the galaxy would be better at concealing
Im lazy so samsung buds
34 ads on a 7 minute video
Headphones that aren‚Äôt Apple never fit in my ear. They always fall out üòÇ
You should review the Jaybird Vistas!
AirPods ‚úÖ
Being able to use one ear bud at a time is a HUGE factor for me when deciding to buy wireless ear buds. I sometimes like to wear one under my ear muffs at work, you can&#39;t hear anyone worth crap anyway so might as well have some music lol. I bought a pair of edifier tws3 and they are pretty good but dont work worth crap on PC, the audio constantly cuts out and there is a massive delay between video and audio when watching youtube, but when I use them on my S9 they work awesome. <br><br><br>There are actually a lot of ear buds that don&#39;t really work on PC bluetooth apparently, not sure why. Gonna be buying these next pay day when I can afford it!
The more you wear the buds, the less you feel them. You should use the buds for a week and let us know how you get on
I have the akg earbuds from s10e and they hurt in the correct ears
My choice would be (OG Samsung Cookies) them galaxy joints for my iPhone 11. Shit I&#39;ll pass on both &amp; go with bose or Sony for my audio quality.
This is common sense. If you have an Android Device go for galaxy buds, if you‚Äôre an iPhone user get AirPodsü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they both cater to their respective brands and if you get them mismatched with your phone they won‚Äôt perform to their fullest potential
Lewis please do review for Noise shots X1 air.
no cap and thats on period
airpods de way
For me is impossible to have the full volume in my buds, the sound is too high
I dont recommend them at calls they suck
Smh so much poor people who don‚Äôt have enough money for them BEATS
Is there an app that I can use on my iPhone that gives me the settings on the buds???
I went with AirPods 2 for my all day pods and jabra elite 65t for my workout/ need more secured fit situations
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWqsZesm_E&amp;t=54">0:54</a> you can do that as soon as you open the AirPod case and take them out on an iPhone
I‚Äôve had both now, but I like AirPods better. <br><br>Samsung seemed to disconnect a lot more. With my phone in my pocket I‚Äôd see 1-2 stutters per hour on the Samsung‚Äôs but none on the AirPods. As nice as all the extra features were, I couldn‚Äôt keep the Samsung‚Äôs. <br><br>All that said, the AirPods fit nicely for me. I know many people who hate the fit of AirPods, and the Samsung‚Äôs still a fantastic option.
Which are better to connect with samsung galaxy?
I don‚Äôt know what this guy is talking about. I WANT to know that the earbud is in my ear so I know if it fell off or whatnot
so wheres the souljapods vs those BROKE pods...
Like = AirPods <br>Reply = Galaxy Buds
what is the app called
watching this without headphones
Someday test punjabi or Indian songs on your headphone test...you have huge fan following here :-)
I tried over 10 earbuds in 2019, Galaxy buds is one the shittiest ones, it&#39;s a piece of junk and has a lot of issues. it&#39;s a total disgrace and stupidity for Samsung to make this crap.
Both of them
I had the Iphone 8 + airpods and then switched to Galaxy S10 and recieved the buds. I think the airpods are easier to use, but the buds are just way better at almost everything else, and something I worry about, is that people around me can also enjoy my music while I was wearing the airpods
Please try NOISE X5 Shots earbuds
Hey hi am willing to purchase the S_buds in next few days,I have  a doubt on this product regarding its comfort and sound quality.<br>Am going to use it mostly for gym n run..what&#39;s do u say..?<br><br>Like I have seen other products like noise,boult..but they  pain after a a hour and sound quality is not that good.
Almost lost air pod because I never fell them is my air pods
The galaxy buds suuuuuck when used with an iPhone every time I try and use them to talk on the phone people complain
Of course you like the feeling of Airpods better, you have gotten yourself use to it. Wear the Samsung for a month then try the Airpods on, you&#39;ll hate them. It&#39;s the same for everything, I hate the feeling of wearing a new pair of glasses, but a week later I can&#39;t switch back.
I beg some1 reply to this comment what devices do the samsung buds connect to
Connectivity? Who wins?
airpods = like<br>galaxy buds = comment
Your review is helpful but not that helpful!
Their both good but tbh AirPods just look nicer and sound better
Airpods look like Nike sign in ur ear.
Get airpods
Airpods is for flex
FIRST ...SORRY.......but let me guest ...U wan&#39;t to choose the Airpods for Comfort,Sound Quality, and Built Quality like Feels Solid....AT THAT TIME ...But as u said..HARD TO PICK...maybe..MAYBE .. because Galaxy the Galaxy Buds is newer....like it Feels or Sounds  NEW.....And Again SORRY...I&#39;m just GUESSING...ha ha. .....
You know fighting for which brand is better looks dumb because both brands are just really amazing awesome brands. And they just insult them like wtfüôÑ
Fucking hate AirPods so much they never look good when I wear them, they don‚Äôt sit on my face like I see when other people wear them

Can it work in my samsung j8?
Galaxy Buds: Like<br><br><br>Air Pods: Comment
I bought Galaxy Buds yesterday and my girlfriend and parents told me I look like I&#39;m wearing Hearing Aids lol! Anyway, it&#39;s significantly better than Airpods for me, since it doesn&#39;t fall of easily and the sound is a little better, and the other features like touch pad and all that.
ATTENTION IPHONE USERS!! The app does not work on IOS. Like people can see
Just bought my Galaxy Buds today. Love them üñ§
I bought Galaxy buds it&#39;s so nice <br> My friend have airpods  not very good
Galaxy pods are better
My friend was wearing a hijab and her airpods underneath and freaked out cause she thought she lost them
i think people like juul pods more
Even Travis couldn&#39;t figure out which one to buy after watching this. He ended up buying Skullcandy buds. Lol.üòãüòãüòã.
At least one person in every class I have has a pair sometimes upwards of five
Hey I know I&#39;m late to the galaxy buds but I want to know if i should buy them. I have the note 9 and I got airpods. Should I buy the galaxy buds?
is the bass better than the akg ones?
No matter what extra options samsung throw at their products they still just aren‚Äôt as good as apple products. Cant quite pin point why but thats just how it. Apple products are just so sleek and refined to touch and use. Apple‚Äôs simplicity is why people love them yet samsung think if they throw 80 options on their products it‚Äôll somehow outsell the Apple products and it never works.
Apple is not better then android and android is not better then apple<br><br>People have OPINIONS
I think the Samsung headphones look better, and have far more features, and I think the airpods look pretty stupid when you are wearing them
I always liked samsung better
I have both. Mainly cause I Use Samsung products and my wife uses Apple.
I&#39; used to have an iPhone with the airpods but I got tired of both of them so I switched to Samsung but I can&#39;t get the galaxy buds but the airpods aren&#39;t bad so I don&#39;t have a problem of sticking to em<br><br>In conclusion I don&#39;t necessarily regret the purchase but it could&#39;ve been better with the buds.
OK BUT... Where do you get your hoodies?
I will get the apple air pods<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because these have dental floss situation
I like this guy bc he actually thinks about which sounds better, not just bc the phone he has.
