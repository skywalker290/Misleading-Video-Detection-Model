Your favorite smartphone right now... Galaxy S10 or something else?
on the Note 7 its called &quot;Night Theme&quot;
Old Samsung Experience beats the New Samsung Experience
Leave bixby alone, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with it at all
missing this old setup
Nostalgia at its best🫠
He has dirty hands
It&#39;s you saying that
battery disaster
I like how I can customize the app icon looks and size
I love how you can reconfigure the Bixby key to Google
Damn i miss these old unboxy therapies ♥️
End of 2021 still using my S10+ dont see any need to upgrade. Love this phone.
Two years down the line and still my favorite
I&#39;ve had it 6 months and love it
By far still my favorite galaxy
Fact: In a couple of weeks, this video will change from one year ago to two years ago.
I don&#39;t wanna switch from apple.... I&#39;ll just have both
whos watching this in 2021 lmbo
Here I am in 2020 trying to figure out if I should save some money and get the S10 or just go all out and buy the s20
Watching in my s10+
We don&#39;t care about buttons.. bring the led notification light back!!!!
Dude... you look like Connor McGregor&#39;s brother.
Wait that is not s10 right?
Tbh this is the only phone I&#39;ll get if my LG G7 ThinQ&#39;s battery dies soon, and it&#39;s late 2020. I&#39;d rather have an older flagship than a new budget/mid range phone.
I Haaate this damn fake trend they cut the video every damn 2 sec. why not keep it natural and roling? This cutting shit makes it fake and annoying. i can´t watch it. i´m out.

Can you make a video about s10e
Watching on s7edge ?
S10+ is incredibly Beautiful.  Samsung is always years ahead.
Samsung is always being better than apple
Who&#39;s watching this on their Samsung s10+ ?
U can change the face unlock <br>Quick unlock in settings
If you can reach too the top too swipe down setings, why do you need to have them lower
See I love watching unbox therapy because lew brakes the stereotype of needing to buy or use and iPhone where there are good and arguably better android phones out there
bxActions made me a fan of the &quot;bixby&quot; button.
Me watching this on my s10plus lol
I m use s10 plus ..one of the best phone
The last time Samsung was on the consumer&#39;s side.... The last time....
I got the s10 plus like 3 months ago anf i love it. It takes really good photos.
Mine is arriving today can’t wait
I love the rear and front appearance of s10 ...
<b>E</b>
I like your videos
For me, this is the most complete phone today. If the S20 Ultra came with a headphone jack, it will definitely be the most complete phone but sadly it doesn&#39;t have it. Please Samsung, don&#39;t remove the SD Card for the next flagship.
You can turn off the swipe up for face unlock so it instantly takes you to your main screen
there is an option for the facial recognition to go directly
Samsung galaxy s10 plus has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, snapdragon 855,  4gb ram, 1 tirabyte of internal storage<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Pretty  Good  !!
&#39;It does actually look for blood flow...&#39;<br><br>You can&#39;t prove that wrong
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=220">3:40</a> Yes out of the box it is a two - step process, but they let you change that setting.... 🙄
Hello inbox therapy!  I wander what are you doing with all those phone 😂😂😂😂 any for sale?  Just curious,  I can&#39;t afford one any way
s10plus, its a great smartphone.if you dont wanna pay that much choose s8🧐
I had an s8 Iv always had a problem with my finger tip being moist and could never get the finger print to work ever and facial never worked because if if a little brighter or darker it never works
Actuallly when you have Face Recognition as a means to unlock your phone, you can configure it so you don&#39;t have to do an extra swipe to unlock it.  Was wondering how you would do it and stumbled across it the other day, and also there was a YouTube video explaining it too.  It works the same was as the Galaxy s8 (which I&#39;ve got).  Go into Biometrics and Security &gt; Face Recognition (when you have registered a face) &gt; and then there should be an option that says &#39;Stay On Lock Screen&quot;.  It should be on by default and if it is, toggle the switch to the off position, and then the next time you lock your phone and then as soon as you unlock your phone again, you won&#39;t need to swipe on your phone and it automatically unlocks.  Hope that helps
Bixby has got to be one of the most disrespected pieces of software the world has ever known
아이폰있는데 근데 s10 너무 예쁘다 😭🤩
Its so sad to see that the headphone jack is a feature now rather than a compulsion
Got the 10s + yesterday
Nice!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=240">4:00</a> yeah like watching hentai<br><br><br>100% me
Do i get a s10+ or a s20+ because i love the waterfall screen on the s10 but the s20 has a bigger screen<br><br>Edit.i already got the s20ultra
Feb 21, 2019 published date<br><br>And today feb 21, 2020 here i am watching it.
I really agree on lew with this. At first I admire a stock android experience and never really a fan of samsung. But when i got a second hand galaxy s8 that has one UI. I fell in love with the software, for me its better than stock! It is basically a stock android experience  but better and improved.
whenever i want to decide on buying a tech, I always come to your channel. keep it up!
I’m considering getting an android phone. I want to try it out and see how I like it.
I have used S9+ and not like it on the whole. I feels like the software on Samsung phones are just sort of &quot;slow by design&quot;, I mean those little transitions animations that are just unneccessary. Google and Apple nail the animation speed in my opinion.
If the Samsung s10 plus had single camera on the front instead of dual camera it could look much much better
I have had my phone since it came out and it will be my last phone till it stops working. It has everything I need and with the new UI update Its even better. Hopefully this phone last me for at least 5 years
Did anyone realised that he has a galaxy watch
i just watch this beacause im poor and i dont have a modern phone and i have a flip pone
bigsby nightmare is real
Him: dirty fingertips= &quot;A certain kind of business&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Me: Um... ok.
There is now options to disable the swipe on the face recognition.. one ui 2.0 is amazing!
I was about to by one, but if the dog don&#39;t love it...<br>Maybe he knows something
😂😂
Yes.
This makes me want to buy an iPhone
You can turn off the swipe up face unlock thing
Then the oneplus 7 pro came and took it all from samsung
Watching on my S10+ &lt;3
My cousin likes bixby idk why
Most of these options are in my s8+
Samsung allows you to skip lock screen, le the way the OnePlus does when it scans your face.  It&#39;s disabled by default but it&#39;s there.
I got all of that on my s9 plus as well
Man I hope we can use eye scanner next time

A lot of the things that you think it&#39;s unique to ONEUI actually exists on other android phones like the trick with the notification bar or disabling the animations<br>They also existed on samsung before the ONEUI<br>You&#39;re losing your touch mate.
I don&#39;t know some rumors say the s10 battery is draining so fast is that true or not????
I double tap the screen on my S10+ and its opens without swiping with the face unlock
Bought the S10+ today! Hyped af!
Dark mode was first than iphone
I switched up..... after android for the past 11+ years,  iphone/apple stole me with the iphone 11 pro max... kind of feel dirty not going to lie but we will see because if anything I&#39;ll go back home but this vacation from android will be interesting trip...
The Bixby button actually saved my life when I crack my phone screen rendering it completely unusable. Was making calls and sending texts all throughout the Bixby button for about a month until I was able to fix the screen.
If you go into unlock settings you can change the setting so the phone will unlock immediately..🙂
Why am I watching this when I own an iPhone ?
SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU ONE DAY GO TO THE NORTH POLE OR ANY COLD PLACE AND PUT YOUR HAND IN THE WATER AND THE BLOOD STOPS FLOWING TO YOUR FINGER? XD
Why does everyone hate apple a phones a phone isn&#39;t it guys 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
So I&#39;ve been using the s10 for a few weeks now...<br><br>Dont get me wrong, it&#39;s amazing, but I get trolled so heavily by friends if they get their hands on it.<br><br>Because the face id is so good, my friends can just hold it in front of my face for half a second and unlock it :/
Any phone that has split screen feature is better than iPhone
Should i buy iPhone 11 or Samsung s10??
Lol
For face recognition you can make it so it unlocked without having to swipe in the settings ever since samsung s8. Everything that you guys cry about samsung already has but you have to configure it from the settings because yes, samsung is VERY customisable and that is why I only buy samsung.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=240">4:00</a> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wanted to buy s10+ or new iPhone. Got the galaxy A70 instead. Used the rest of the money left to go to the moon and back. Money well spent. Galaxy looks awesome from the space.
Samsung: has quality screen<br>Apple:has quality screen<br>Google: hAs lEd lIghTs tHat mAkE thE sCreEn pInK aFteR 2 wEeKs
Actually, TouchWiz goes back to those &quot;pre-smartphone era&quot; feature phones, not running Android, but a proprietary operating system.
You can make it with settings so it opens the screen right away when face is registered.
Why do all my galaxy s9 and up get burnt in image so fast? I keep brightness down
You can change the settings to go straight to the homescreen after face unlocking
What is that orange wallpaper in the thumbnail?
You can fix the thing with the face id unlock .. and make it in one step from the settings. I am with the S10 and i just look at it and the phone unlocks ✌😉
The face un lock problem  can customize in settings
You are my favorite YouTuber I love how funny you are and your different prospectives on the devices you review !! ANOTHER GREAT REVIEW THANK YOU
Don&#39;t know if you already know but you can get right into the phone after the facial recognition. There is a specific setting for that.
He knows, we have to silence him.
Hey why are you leaving out the S10e on an unboxing / review
What’s so wrong with the bixby button
I had the same problem with face recognition.Then I went to face recognition settings and turned off the &quot;Stay on lock screen&quot; then it worked so fast.I didn&#39;t need to swipe up to open.
Really? Swipe down twice to have all those easily accessible things readily available.... Been on HTC since... Well forever. Same with iPhone stuff. Seems like people are being made happy with stuff that&#39;s actually old. Ah well you know what they say... Wait long enough and it&#39;ll get back into fashion.
Mine is Samsung S10
IOS is removing too much shit off of the app store and plus my iphone is glitchy. I’m switching over to Samsung.
you can change face unlock 2 step in settings
Now I know Mexican cartels cant unlock my phone now with my finger.
What if they don&#39;t chop you finger of
You can switch the face unlock settings to were it goes to the home screen with no swipe
places give me a one phone s10 🙏
I will definitely buy it, in the next 5 years, pre owned.
I&#39;m a painter and never bother with finger print scanners on my s7 as it NEVER works if I&#39;ve got paint on my hands. I&#39;m about to upgrade to the s10 plus so I&#39;m really hoping this works better.
U can change setting of face unlock directly goes to the home screen lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=250">4:10</a> I am a casual swimmer
Why is the 2 swipes down at the beginning so exciting? Doing it on my s8+ rn?🤔🤦‍♂️
Is it “apparently” or “supposedly”?
Bruh... i cant wait till the end of the month when i get this! I just wanna see the screen, im on a cracked iphone 8 plus right now lol
Lew you can change the face unlock from two step to single step ; just open settings - biometric and security - face recognition - and turn off the &quot; stay on lock screen &quot; , by then you can immediately go to home after face unlock🙂
Watching on a iPhone XR , this phone is good but in the beginning I wanted a galaxy s10
Subbed and liked. Great content.
Is this Guy high or what LOL
U could always double Swipe down notifications
They have the depth vision camera on the front of the + so why don&#39;t they use it for 3d face unlock?
That system layout is nothing new... Oneplus put it in the 6 and 6 t with oxygen os
I want a phone.  with the best sound It should have absolute best DA converter It should play DSD files and it should play 24 bit pcm sound.  Well it should be so good that even the bat would be satisfied
Then you have to answer the question Which phone should you buy if you do not want an Android phone?
While I&#39;m in looove with that gorgeous holographic skin I&#39;ll keep my s9.
For me charging phone from other phone is very idiotic :D<br>what do you think &gt;
I’m an iphone user. Honestly most of my teenage and adult life I didn’t even look for whatever else was out there. My very first smart phone provided by my dad was an iphone. I just stuck with it. Looking at other options is pretty cool.
we all know what he is implying here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=255">4:15</a>
ABOUT THE FACE UNLOCK: on my S8+ , I have been able to go into the settings and disable the swipe after the face unlock, so it should be something you can do on the S10 lineup
A bit of special time with the Mrs, ya get a text, no hand wash, bam still unlocks even when a juicy funk layer...
Hi @Unbox Therapy Hi do you have still some s10? if you have, can you please comtact me on somewhere to help me get ikonik skin in fortnite? I will leave my instagram here-      @callmesasey
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=505">8:25</a> even he doesn’t wanna we the bixby button. 😂😂
Dude you suck at reviews
Is This The One? or Is This The One Ui? :D
Bought an s10 and am now using it as a powerbank for my iphone 🤷‍♂️
Ok im sorry but since i actually have the s10+ ill tell anyone wondering YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HOLD YOUR FINGER THERE THAT LONG FOR THE FINGERPRINT SCANNER  works super fast for me about 90% of the time just have to say
Love one UI
I have a iPhone 6s and sadly I can’t work (yet) to save up money to buy a new phone and I know my parents are not going to buy me a new phone if I ask. I wanted the iPhone XS or XR, but after watching this, I think I’m going to consider putting my money towards Samsung once I start working.
I have a Nokia 6.1 plus<br>and also<br>Galaxy 10e<br>And I have to say that Nokia&#39;s devices are easy to operate with them<br><br>And s10e even after a week of use feels very small in the hand
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=300">5:00</a> you can choose you want it or not
Well..... Looks like I’m upgrading from iOS to android
It&#39;s the best skin I&#39;ve ever used One Ui
When he got to the discussion of &quot;Now, I don&#39;t know what you all do with your fingertips, but I&#39;m out of that department.&quot; OMG I LOST IT :)
ខ្ញុំបាទបានត្រូវរង្វាន់ samsung galaxy សុំសួរបងតើខ្ញុំត្រូវទៅបើកនៅកន្លែងណា
I&#39;m a welder and my hands get beyond dirty and the fingerprint censor still works, and you can always set up Bixby to recognize your voice and you can tell Bixby to unlock your phone, now I wonder if it will work as good with a cold, and Bixby makes siri look stupid.
The Note 8 had this...
Samsung: innovates<br><br>Apple:imitates
But u can change the that swipe thing of the face lock to instant unlock
What&#39;s that watch you&#39;re wearing?
You know you can change the size of the icons and the icons themselves,right?
Watching this on my S9 plus
Guys I got it and I love it :D
You can make the s10 to go directly in to the home screen after  it have been unlucked with face recognition.  You gotta go inte to the the biometric setting and the in to face recognition settings and there will be an option there that you can turn off(it on by deafult)
I want it I just hateeeeeeeeee how the icons look that’s my only issue with galaxies as a whole
Asus has had the double swipe down for settings for a few generations now. Glad Samsung has implemented it because once you&#39;re used to it it&#39;s hard to go back
Definitely I will get one of Galaxy S10 I&#39;m still using Galaxy S9.
Igggghjh *SAMSUNG FUCKING SUCKS ITS SOOOOOOOOOO BROKE APPLE IS SO PERFECT AND IS BEUTIFUL AND GREAT SAMSUNG IS LOW QUALITY HAS A SHITTY CAMERA AND IS TRAAAAAAAAAAAAASH
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=61">1:01</a> is epic
Should I upgrade to this from my iPhone 8 Plus?
Anybody here know what watch he&#39;s wearing
I just made the switch from iPhone to Samsung and let me tell you. There is no way on this planet that I will ever and I mean ever in my life pick up my hard working money and spend on a iPhone much less borrow my own wife iPhone to use again for not even 5 mins. I&#39;m LOVING the S10+ so far and I&#39;m only 2 weeks in
Swipe down with two fingers for s10e or s10 or s10+ to get complete notification panel .... Unbox Therapy!!!
The s10e&#39;s face unlock doesn&#39;t need to swipe in order to unlock the phone, you just have to turn the phone on, and your phone unlocks
Can I change Bixby name
Hey bro plz give one phone that I can play pubg because they have updated it&#39;s more than 2gb I can&#39;t update due low space. If u have...😭👶
Loved my s10+ since I got it. You can change in the settings so just looking at your screen will unlock it without having to press any buttons.

Are dual sim Samsung s10 plus fake ?
It&#39;s supposed to be handled by the fingertips department. Haha
People here are trashing Apple because of them removing the headphone jack and Samsung keeping it in this phone even though this is probably the last Samsung phone with a headphone jack
All my android  users  like this coment
I haven’t seen one of his videos in a while. His voice has changed since he lost weight it kinda threw me
Guy is crazy
I came from a iPhone 7+ and the finger print scanner works 60% better than the s10+.  Most time I just enter my password if face unlock doesn&#39;t work.
S10: like<br>Note9: comment below👇
@t
I got a Samsung before and I got bullied but now it feels so much better to have an I phone 📱 👍🏻
I hate that Bixby button. I gave up my galaxy over that damn button
He looks like wwe samy zayn 😂😂😂
Use two fingers to swipe down the notification bar. Thank me later ;)
How do you turn off Bixby all together. I have already switched the one switch to another app. But the press two times on button is Bixby
😂you dirty man!  You said idk what youf doing with your fingertips and then made a dirty smile😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<br><br>Btw love your video&#39;s❤❤
Should I stick with Samsung and get the s10 or should I switch to Apple? I&#39;m having trouble deciding
Try bxactions for bixby
I still got an S6 that I bought in 2017 and I think I&#39;ll hold off on upgrading until next year.
what&#39;s your smart watch? Xiaomi amazfit 2?
Iphone price is the EA of phones
Face recognition is a lot faster and better on the s10 plus from the s9 plus  and the battery is nuts on the s10 plus
But it does always work
But it does always work
The inscreen fingerprint scanner is a lot slower than the s9 plus
Does it still have bloatware/apps that you can&#39;t uninstall, such as news, youtube, etc?
Do you have to use finger print or face unlock?
Who else want the ikonik skin?
S10plus is great ..love mine
The settings allow you to let it unlock immediately with face id
This phone makes me want to switch my iPhone XR
Can you change that animation for the finger scanner? Personally i don’t like it, makes things cringy
I use my S10 with face unlock and it skips the swipe up part. You can turn off that extra step.
I love the option of finger scanner and Face ID... I just got the iPhone Xs max and the Face ID is really hard to use if you’re laying down or in the dark... I wish I had the option. It’s so cool that they have it on the glass.
you can increase sensitivity of the ultrasonic sensor too!
Samsung is taking hardware to another level<br>Google is taking software to another level <br>Iphone is taking price to another level😂😂😂
This is the best tech channel
My s7 edge has the same double swipe down feature?
I&#39;m just bought the S10 and I love it , and i just switched from iPhone, had to see both worlds to see what I like the best, Samsung hasn&#39;t disappointed so far
14 million subscribers, what a joke.
I only want the ikonik skin
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=495">8:15</a> ...the best part of this video!
I prefer Apple phones 😂
now i know where cory barlog got his look
I feel like Samsung&#39;s/galaxy&#39;s are more for business people and iphones are more for teens and young adults 💀
Smart people buy Android devices.<br>Basic people/people who don&#39;t know shit about smartphones buy Apple devices.<br><br>It&#39;s as simple as that.
You can make it unlock as soon as it recognizes you
Hey dude! Big fan of yours....<br>Would you mind giving me that kind of phone😁🤗
Can someone tell me what the unboxing video is called?
Where is ur unboxing video for this phone?
I love my s10. I got mine in flamingo pink!
Currently on Moto that&#39;s tuff I think I&#39;m going to buy the S10 they are really stepping up their game with their phone.
It really hearts me every time you slide that phone across the table
Im watching this only cuz i wanna buy this phone for the Fortnite skin and emote lmao
Which should I buy? The s10 or s10 plus?
The finger business XD
Lol my figer tip are  full of thc of all that fire i be grinding
Wet dirty figure tips sounds like a good time 🤣🤣
I’m looking here because I’m really considering leaving Apple 👀 I’ve been with them for years but their storage, battery, and camera quality kinda suck.
Cool. But I’m staying with s9+
those are some nice phones but that puppy is gorgeous.
Waiting for the s12 to get the s10
I have some of those features on my Samsung S8.
Hello, I would like to ask if it would be possible for your cell phone to acquire a skin of the game fortnite, only has this skin has the cell phone
me watching s10s from my j3 pro 😅
Shhhhhh..dont tell the government
My phone turns into an Autobot; it has alot to offer
abolutely zero unboxing happened in this video. thumbs down (dislike).
I don’t what to get galaxy s10 or s10 plus
Aw I need a new phone :(
I have finally purchased the Samsung Galaxy s10 plus, and all I have to say is thank you. Thank you for convincing me to make the switch Unboxing!
I&#39;m a fan of samsung ever since. I didn&#39;t even tried apple lol. Samsung  to s10 now.
Watching this on a s10
Nightmode is crucial for your sleep. People have major sleep issues because of phone use. Its not just because its comfortable
Great review..especially coming from you 😍
I thought it is a review
I&#39;m on S7 edge and I still kinda prefer the UI from Oreo 8.0. One UI is too bright for me.
Please can I have a good say if I should buy this phone?
I&#39;m only here cause at&amp;t told me I could upgrade to a phone I can never afford for a hundred bucks. But nah...
And I have been hating android but now i&#39;m probably gonna buy one😂😂😂😂
how i can use s9 as keyboard of s10+?
LG V40 has about the same specs but way cheaper at $350 refurb or New unlocked for $485 with amazing #1 Audio among cell phones with that ESS DAC
Why do people not like Bixby? I genuinely don&#39;t understand. Can I get an explanation please.
I love S10
Im getting the s10 for my birthday wish me luck 😀
I....got the s10 for a fortine skin.Lmfao.
I need a new phone. You should gift me with one.
We&#39;ve been able to to lower animation for 5 gens now my man.
That  pull down feature has been on even the low end $100 LG phones for years and you can reorganize the icons
Actually there is an option on s10+ if you want the phone to unlock directly afer detecting your face
I bought 2 of these (me and wife)  Been using Samsung S5, tired of the tech being old, tried iPhone S8+ (COMPLETE waste of money).<br>  So, got 2-S10&#39;s.<br>   My take:<br>   Samsung trying desperately to emulate iPhone platform which is a HUGE mistake.<br>  The fingerprint reader (sonic reader...bwahahaha) FAILS with amazing accuracy.  I (and wife) count on it to NOT work.<br>   Samsung customer service is absolutely pathetic and that&#39;s a compliment, I assure you.  Lie to you, lie about you, will NOT follow-up.<br>  Ear buds are okay only. <br>  MY ADVICE:  YOU CANNOT TRUST SAMSUNG, don&#39;t give them you money.<br>  FCK Samsung...
Wooooooaaaaaaaahhhhhhh (“what u do with your finger tips”)
So what about the Chevy S10
Apple said they are removing headphone jacks to make the phone thinner but the s10 is thinner but they still have the headphone jack. Facts
Bro my dad got that phone and it’s pretty cool
who&#39;s watching this video on iphone 4 hahaha
lmao dirty Harry 🤘
I have always used Samsung software, one  ui sets the bar way high!
A lot of is the same.
Dude the pull down thing from the beginning is on my s7
Apple innovation died with Steve Jobs.  Im very much over apple products
I switched from A7 2017 to S10+ and all i can say is that, I&#39;m very impressed. Everything is so perfect, no regret. Loving it so much! I recommend you to switch to S10+!
What if you remap the Bixby button to load pornhub Lmao.😂
Whats the price?!?!?
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing with your finger tips&quot;
S10  came out and I&#39;m still on S3
<b>I am poor....send me anyone of those ????</b>
I&#39;m a long time LG user who is burnt out using them since the lg3 and was let down by the g8. I was think of an S10+. Do ya think it would be hard to learn?
I&#39;m going to keep my silver Note 9 for another 3 years😊
To be honest my Droid turbo 2 is still holding it own these many years later. In the looks department well, not so much. <br>But for everyday use from Gmail to YouTube, texting, FaceTime and running the game asphalt 9 it does fine. Hardware wise I barely notice a difference between these new phones and the Droid turbo 2.<br>But the Galaxy Note 10 might be the phone I jump to. Everything else has been incremental improvements Samsung has done an awesome job on the Note 10. <br>Seeing that the Galaxy &quot;e&quot; is close to the same size as the Droid turbo 2 might even consider that. <br>Samsung has certainly stepped up their game.
I&#39;m really a big fan of the Galaxy s10 plus❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
My dad works for samsung
Went from s8 to s10 and wow great call, not that the s9 is bad in any way it&#39;s great but wow
Can you give me the ikonik skin? :D
Sangsung all over here nothing against apple but the brand seems boujee to me and there very expensive to break so much
Freakin hilarious 😂... Now I don&#39;t know what you do with your fingertips
I just ordered mine. Can&#39;t wait!
i don&#39;t think you can use the bixby button for google assistant which makes no sense
Notch or punch hole looks like  imperfection to me galaxy s9 for me the best phone
Took the reverse wireless charging idea from Huawei 🤣 still playing catch up with the best maker of smartphones right now Huawei Mate 20 Pro is 6 months old and still imo the best phone out there huawei know how to make a phone just wish they would make there software nicer to look at functions great just ugly
Love the prism white color...but i kinda wish the 12gb version...idk what to do..
Should I get the regular Galaxy S10 or the Galaxy S9 Plus? Currently using a Samsung J5 2015
I like my tech gear like anyone else but it didn&#39;t take all the recent news in the last few years about cell phone provides &amp; social media sites sharing &amp; selling customers private information to realise that modern cell phones are built to log on into &amp; track your every move &amp; what you&#39;ve looked at &amp; what you&#39;ve said &amp; though some may not find this an issue, I Do...<br><br>Seriously a fingerprint scanner &amp; now a face recognition scanner, what next stool &amp; urine samples!..<br><br>I remember the days before cell phones &amp; of not using or needing a cell phone but that was until of course they became more accessible/affordable &amp; eventually reliable...<br><br>But even then you had enough as you had your Calls &amp; Text Services which was &amp; is all you really needed but now for the last 10 years or more cell phones are a circus act of gimmicks &amp; data collecting of the cell phone users private information &amp; daily routines...<br><br>My S7 Edge which I got a few years back had the fingerprint scanner but did I use it Hell No...<br><br>Users of cell phones have become addicted to &amp; sold on to the idea that without one there must be something wrong with you &amp; you must have one as you can do all sorts of great things on a cell phone...<br><br>And Yes I agree with this but I&#39;m not giving up my right to my personal privacy being constantly &amp; illegally violated by companies selling my personal &amp; private information...<br><br>Then you had the let&#39;s get into the kids market for these phones &amp; build cell phones for kids that are hopefully not going to give them some sort of cancer or illness from the materials used in cell phones &amp; after many years they developed a so called child user friendly version which wouldn&#39;t cause any ill effect to children &amp; then the seed was really planted...<br><br>My kid(s) have a cell phone so therefore I can rest easy as I can contact them &amp; vice versa when I need to &amp; I will know they are safe...<br><br>But your missing the point of what these companies are doing &amp; that&#39;s getting you addicted to products that if used properly for what they should only be used for which is calls/texts &amp; even emails, then Yes it&#39;ll come in hand...<br><br>But the very nature of human beings is to want more &amp; then even more &amp; phone developers along with app developers are all to happy to oblige you with all sorts of crap along with your every move being tagged &amp; before you know it you dont own a cell phone but a multimedia unit that owns you &amp; will eat into your life if your not careful...<br><br>I&#39;ve seen relationships destroyed &amp; so called family nights become a farce because those people in those families are all sitting there all in the same room but they are not talking or socialising but instead they are all on their phone/laptop etc &amp; not even talking to one another...<br><br>Its become an addiction to the point that you use a cell phone for everything else than what it was initially built for &amp; that is to make calls or leave &amp; send messages but instead a monster has been created to the point that when I walk down the street I rarely see anyone&#39;s head facing forwards as they are all looking down at their phones &amp; no matter where you go you&#39;ll be sitting next to someone who is on their phone but not for calls but for all the other junk that its happy to throw at you...<br><br>There is a TV advert that&#39;s been on for about a month now for a certain phone next working &amp; a well known actor playing a gentleman who gets on a packed train &amp; everyone of the other passenger is watching some TV series or drama like Game Of Thrones as an example...<br><br>Very quickly he noticed that he hadn&#39;t seen that particular episode &amp; therefore doesn&#39;t want the plot &amp; suspense ruined so he gets up to find somewhere on the train where he can go &amp; not see or hear what is happening with regards this show that he&#39;d rather wait to get home to see it but there&#39;s nowhere to go so he turns round and says <br>&quot; What Is Wrong With You People &quot; &amp; the sad thing is it&#39;s being used as a positive way to advertise how not to miss your favourite programs when in fact we have become addicted to these gadgets to the point we are literally the walking dead...<br><br>Look I could go on forever about how out of control this has become but I won&#39;t as Each To There One but I will leave by saying &quot; Wake Up &quot;<br><br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.....
Sorry but Android users are just salty they can&#39;t afford an iPhone. If you think in-screen fingerprints are next-level technology then you&#39;re missing out on the world my friend.
I NEED IT.
My Huawei Mate 20 pro can do exactly the same and I have it for 6 months.... Thank you Samsung but you are too late, like Apple (regarding software update...) =)
Samsung: Give them more to do and see<br>Apple: Give them the same exact phone, charge them more for the same phone.
Yes it is the phone
Have u guys bought this phone I just wanna know your impression?
Ø555Ø<br><br>Bixby never a problem.<br>Problem with S10..... that &quot;MOLE&quot; (Punch Hole)<br>Even my S8 look better.
Favorite smartphone is galaxy s10. Just sold my iPhone to get one of these. After apple came out with basically the same phone two years in a row. But then Samsung came out with this. I’m done with apple.
Samsung allways have good things out when it comes to tech knology and smartphones.👍😦
😂😂😂
This guy makes me want to switch from iPhone to Samsung s10+
I can&#39;t help but notice a lot of techtubers seems to ignore the mere fact that Sony&#39;s latest phones are much better than any of these gimmicky ones...
This dude is the description of a millennial
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=242">4:02</a> - busted out laughing haha reminded me of The Office
Isnt that secondary swipe on every android phone?
Heres a useful tip:Wireless charging works with the iphone 8 and above and even the note 9 etc. it is not just the s10 that charges
THE FINGER DEPARTMENT!!!!
Thumbs up, If you&#39;re on the Galaxy S8+!
Two things I love about Samsung <br>1. They listen to the people.<br>2. They make the phone to fit you.<br><br>Apple doesnt listen to anyone tbh, they literally just make the same phone for like 5 years straight.
It’s good to know one can unlock your phone when you’re dead.
cool phone, cool guy, liked
The double swipe down feature is the same on the one plus phones
I&#39;m watching this video with my s10 ☺
You have to tap the fingerprint scanner. Don&#39;t hold it it will make it slower.
unbox therapy can you get me the ikon fortnite skin if you haven&#39;t done it for anyone else yet ?
Now you can use Bixby button to open different apps, by doing a single press or double press. Go to advance settings and then Bixby Key. I have set it up with Bixby a single press and Google Pay with a double press. And yes, you cannot use other voice assistants.
he bought two s10s...
Apple killer
iPhone gang
No matter how much Samsung makes their products look good LMFAOO as long as it’s running Android os I won’t be buying their phones
I&#39;ve had Samsung phones for long time, my s7 active had double pull down notifications bar, my now note 9 looks same
Anybody else find that butt dialing is worse with samsungs new one ui?<br><br>Talking about putting your phone to sleep while on messages and trying to put it in your pocket<br><br>Im using a S9 +
Problems with this phone : <br>Button for voice assistant useless<br>3 virtual button when One plus has slides<br>The price. When One Plus also has the slide down for easy access of shortcuts...
That&#39;s funny when I do the face recognition it automatically unlocks and takes me to the homescreen I never have to swipe up after
Got my s10 yesterday
I have the s10e now but just feels too small thinking about getting the S10 but not a fan of the curved display.<br>I always use cases and tempered glass screen protector.<br>Can anyone tell me how the S10 with a case feel with one handed use (I have medium size hands)
Literally everything he mentions LG put out in the V series like 3 years ago!
I&#39;ve got the s9+ it&#39;s pretty much the same, with the face unlock you can change it in settings so all you need to do is wake the screen it recognizes your face and unlocks so you dont have to swipe aswel to open.<br><br><br>But I reckon the iris sensor/recognizer is better then the face reconizer
There&#39;s a setting to open the screen with face unlock without the extra seioe6.
Samsung: OH CRAP WE KEEP LOSING SALES TO APPLE!<br><br>Also Samsung: well let’s just copy apple so we can maybe sell some phones. <br><br>Samsung fans: oh wow there changing the game!!
I like how people say &quot;fast&quot; when its stock and doesnt have snapchat, Google maps, YouTube, facebook and spotify going in the background 😬
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=230">3:50</a> so it will finally work while I am walking in the rain? My iPhone 7 Plus can‘t do this
No blood flow?! Sold.
Where&#39;s the unboxing ?
They`ve only kept half of the Bixby remapping promise so far. That`s a bummer in my oppinion. You can chose if you want that button to do something on a 1x press but Samsung will make you open Bixby on 2x. And vice-versa. Why can`t they just kill Bixby and let ppl fully customize what that button does on 1x press and 2x press?

One thing, you have to give Samsung credit but the real question is will the power share feature make it into the the next gen model Galaxy S11.
Well after using the s10 all day i can really say these reviews are BS just clowns getting paid to tell a lie to help sell a product. The s10 battery didnt last all day after 8 hours needed a charge. I made a 15 min video porn of course and texted and talked went on fb a lot which is what i do everyday not just to test the s10. The video compared to my note 5 was the same so the 3 camera deal is nothing but hype. Its to skinny after using my note 5 for yrs. The tech is a few upgrades from the note 5 after all its 5 yrs newer but the new tech is nothing to go crazy over. Note 5 wins hands down over all the newer phones. The iphone x is a big joke its laying there never use it. S10 i will use until i take it back. I missed the return date with the iphone x got stuck with it.
This or keep my s8+ for another year?
DuckDuckGo &gt; Google
Otis should get his own channel. Your reign will be over dude.
If the S10+ is that big there&#39;s only one question..<br><br><br><br><b><i>WHAT ABOUT THE NOTE 10</i></b>
For the record, you can reconfigure the bixby button now with an app called bixbye! It works really well.
it would be cool if he reviews the best gadgets at the end of the year. like all the phones, laptops, tablets, etc that he has viewed over the year he announces the best. but then again there would be no point since companies like Samsung, apple, and oppo to name a few will all make new products. but you know just for the sake of it.
What the hell are you talking about my dude? My S7 has the exact same &quot;pull the top down for one handed use&quot; so it&#39;s been the same for AT LEAST 3 years.
Waiting for note 10
If anyone has this phone and doesn’t play Fortnite message me on Discord (Xerø#5003) or Twitter (@Xer0Skill) *Twitter plz
That second swipe isn&#39;t just on the s10 though?
Oneplus&#39;s implementation is better and faster
I&#39;m stuck with both because I want to use the apple face emoji but that&#39;s the only reason I want get iPhone I. Stuck in between can anyone give me any advice?
nevermind the iphone x being the future of smartphone, THIS is the future of smartphone
Just bought S10+,so far the worst Samsung phone I ever  owned. Fingerprint scanner works 6 out of 10, smart Lock doesn&#39;t work at all, Samsung pay = always connection  problem.
since dudes like Unbox Therapy have millions of suscriberes they probably get pay extra cash from samsung and Apple, but mostly from samsung, I have a bad experience with samsung galaxy note 9 after nearly 8 months of use, I bought it after I saw one of this dude from unbox therapy video now I realize that is bs about samsungs phones,  note 9 which I will never buy again samsung products because I think they are trying hard to get to a new technology that phones are not ready for, maybe an iphone will last longer.
Ok i fell for the hype twice first the iphone x i fell for that BS now i just fell for the S10 BS this ppl get paid by these phone companies to run BS game on us. Oh the finger print scanner u damn near have to bust the phone for it to work useing yo code is faster. Its small AF dont have a full hand feeling. My note 5 is still my favorite phone Samsung maxed the phone industry out when they made the note 5 there isnt anything that comes close to it.
a unprofessional review of s10 but no unboxing video of a s10 on &quot;unbox therapy&quot;
why the hell is unbox therapy not having unboxing videos anymore?
Good for my super damn sweaty hands
that pull down UI has been on the phones since the s6... its not new.
So they will use my finger, then chop it off?
lemme flex on yall  what im using right now<br>Huawei mediapad T1 7.0<br>-2 MP Front and back camera<br>-8 GB of internal storage<br>-1 G of Ram<br>-Quad Core 1.2 GHz<br>-Version 4.4.2<br>- And a good 4100 MaH Battery👌👍
Lew, What watch are you wearing? Looks dope af bro...
You can change the face unlock situation in settings and it will unlock right when it sees you
so exciting, like snowboarding with the condors in the Andes.
My Favourite Vloger Unbox Therapy
CM Launcher has that double swipe as well
You fucked up your beard 😂😂
Guy seems off in this video. Voice is different, eyes are shifty and he doesn&#39;t seem present.
samsung s10 is this the one <br>A human is  this the one
Please  Unbox Therapy please can you give me one phone
Wow you have lots of phone can you give me please i need a phone for school can you give me
Every noticed how boring it is to be using a iPhone..
why Samsung only offer 3 colours in my region: Prism white, black &amp; green. I think they should include more colours like silver which unlike in cars you don&#39;t have to worry about a bird pooping on it lol. Or Stainless steel colour or bring back the old gold colour or light gold
Poor confused Otis. He just wanted to eat his snack.
iPhones are still better🤧
Finger print flow motion ditector:0 wtf
For the face unlock you have to turn off swipe to unlock setting under security so you don&#39;t have to do the 2 step thing. Works for my S8 so I&#39;m guessing Samsung left it on there
How have none of you actually considered App Store &gt; Play Store<br>Heck android names half their apps from apple
he did not even mention the camera quality!
Anybody else facing lag issues during pubg on s10+ ?
So.. like already mentioned you can turn on or off that swipe after unlocking...<br>BUT more importantly the BIXBY button.. Everybody was hating  on it from day 1, but now not only you can disable the accidental turning on, but you can programme it to do all kinds of cool stuff.. And nobody talks about it.<br>For example I&#39;ve made it my &quot;gym&quot; button. So when I get to the gym, I press it and it automatically shuts all apps down (so I don&#39;t get distracted), enables BT (to connect my BT headphones), starts my gym tracking app, starts my gym music playlist and opens my Routine image (i&#39;ve made a screenshot of it)... just one press on the bixby button... nice :)
Sony Xperia
I thought at first when I read this they were going down the Raspberry Pi route and releasing the Samsung Galaxy 10 Dollars.... now that&#39;s a good price for a phone.
The lack of symmetry on the phones chin and notch in the corner annoys me ALOT
Aliens gave us this technology.  Who woulda ever thought we would have this kinda tech 100 years ago   in ww2 . Imagine a s10.   No way eh   aliens bro...aliens
LoL I knew it that fingerprint scanner will be on display
Do you know that has been on every Samsung phone like it&#39;s just like changing brightness
Mechanics have dirty hands
No IR port
My Microsoft phone has most of these....and it&#39;s four years old
i&#39;ll keep my note 9
Samsung makes really good phones, the bad thing is that they become obsolete when a newer one comes out due to no longer being supported.
Secondary swipe has been out since the S8
한국인 손
As a mobile videographer am I good with the s10e battery or go with the s10e for bigger battery?
LOU’S HUMOR MAKES THE CHANNEL 🤣👍🏼🙌🏼
Samsung always impresses me with brand new designs, technology, the only thing changes about IPhones is the number, and they don&#39;t even know how to count right as well
I&#39;ll give you 10 dollars for 25%
Looking at that dark mode.!! I miss my Microsoft lumia 540..!!
I am on a G6. Its a good phone but does not feel like a flagship. More like a High-Mid tier at flagship price. Looking into the 10e.
They just copied the Google pixel
There is a  Chinese phone that I bought  in 2015, that is call The Leagao Lead 9, Those phones can charge other phones Wired without Affecting it&#39;s own Battery Power, it have a 6 Thousand mAh battery in it, &amp; it also Reverse Charge Wirelessly, meaning Back, &amp; Front Wirelessly, no matter if you put it on a wireless charger Back Side or Front, Also you can rest a phone on it Back or Front to charge that phone as well, &amp; again it does not interrup it&#39;s  Battery Power. Fully charged at 5 a.m. it takes 1 hour and 18 minutes From 0% to 100%, &amp; i am playing YouTube Videos all day, &amp; i am  on every Social Media Network i can think of, lots of Pics, &amp; Videos because i&#39;m a barber, sometimes i also charge my clients phones up to 5 who forgot their charges at home am doing so much on it, The maximum SD card Storage is 256 GB, Room 6GB. Powered by Android. at the end of the night when i&#39;m finished working say at 2:30 am the next morning i still have 25% battery left. Which can run mean another 4 hours or more.
I will buy it in 3 years from now. See you in future guys..
My 8 does that and has done the double drop for a long time
does samsung still try to force there god awful apps down your throat? Talking Samsung Pay, Samsung Phone, Galaxy Apps.
Someone please tell how to change the settings on the side volume buttons! Can you not put your phone on silent without going to settings?? I dont mean with vibration only I mean complete silent!
you can actually change the face unlock to open immediately wiith in the settings
i phone sucks! <br>is just ridiculous
Apple left the chat 😂😂
Nothing truly new under the sun here..<br><br>Yet probably sells like water in Sahara.
Getting my s10+tom! Super excited 😋😋😋
It still has a forehead and an even bigger chin. It’s lopsided. The XS doesn’t have either because the bezels are the same all the way around. And before you mention the notch remember how dumb you are. Because Samsung put a hole punch in and you completely forgot about the speaker grill up in the forehead area 🤣 I guess the notch is the better all in one solution for now 😂
Spaget
Talks about nothing the whole video. I wanted to know about the phone.
It&#39;s dope, buuuut I&#39;ll wait for the new note
There is a settings for the facial recognition which is prompts you for an option so you don&#39;t have to swipe up as well, it will just simply recognise your face and the phone will unlock
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=246">4:06</a> LMAO this dude funny
You already can configure the bigsby button..  you change the bigsby setting to double click, and single click opens any app of your choice....    DONT DOUBLE CLICK. Not hard...
Giveaways? Yeah yeah yeah
I work for AT&amp;T and you’ve been able to disable the bixby button to a dead key since forever. I said for a customers s9+ that being said it did take me awhile to do, but it can be 100% shut off cause fuck that key.
My hands are too small even for the S9
Are you going to do any giveaways?
1ua seems a lot like Oxygen OS ...(best UI I&#39;ve ever used)
i think this guy is so handsome if he would shave his beard and mustche
Music in the background please?
There are a few things I wish came with the s10. It doesn&#39;t have multi-app windows. It doesn&#39;t offer read receipts. And the AR emoji is a little glitchy. But the phone itself is so sleek and futuristic. The camera is amazing and it offers 3 different angles/perspectives because of the multiple camera lenses. I upgraded from the s8 and I&#39;m very happy I just hope future updates incorporate what it&#39;s missing. Edit: The front fingerprint sensor is so much more convenient because even towards the end of having my S8 I still had to search for the sensor.
Huawei flagships devices let you choose how to unlock your phone from face id, it&#39;s a very democratic solution in my opinion
Oh slaves! Your new Samsung god is here. Now, quickly, go line up for it, buy it with money you don’t have and argue why your Samsung god is better than you apple igod. And watch videos from this slave as he reviews it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=240">4:00</a> he got fingering people on his mind
You have just made me spend 1000 quid hope I don&#39;t regret this
I 100% agree about the larger icons and the 4 icons horizontal grid. <br>The smartphones nowadays has more and more screen and less and less borders.<br>I started to use this grid and to me improves a lot the ergonomy and the general easier use.
I played with all the models and landed in the E. So far I love it. Coming from S8+ the size and overall experience is so much better.
Samsung is the best.
Hi, your pressing it wrong, your meant to press it quickly not press &amp; hold.<br>😉
Why do I have a Galaxy S8+ when Galaxy S10/S10+ is already here
i&#39;ve got the iPhone Xs and im just gonna get this phone next week instead, looks sick.
My mind is wondering what people are doing with their fingertips now!!
Im using it right now and as a past iPhone user I love it and prefer this over the iPhone 10 X
Which smart watch you are wearing Sir?
Song in the back round??
I&#39;m skipping the S10 and going to save up and wait for the Samsung Fold. Lol
I don’t know how anybody noticed the fingerprint has a problem. Besides that is difficult to fine the place where to put your finger, which is very annoying. Also if you set the fingerprint vertical, you will not be able to unlock the phone in other angle. This it does not happen in One plus and it’s way faster. I know this is another kind of tech, but in a premium and expensive phone like this one should not be happening. Also you forgot to talk about the gesture function with the 3 bars at the bottom. This a good idea but the 3 bars on the bottom are so thin, that sometimes is almost impossible to reach them and worst when you have a case on it. I hope they release an update for both things if not I will returning my phone
Come checkout my youtube channel. <br>Subscribe me and i do the same.
I have to thumbs this down.  You talk about the UI but not enough about the hardware onboard itself.
Hi is this also 4 the note 8,?
Just got my delivery &amp; it was my daughters LOL toy so looks like the s10 won’t be here today 😭😭😭😂
Certain Type of Business? Like i dunno Plumbing? <br>I never Faceplam&#39;d so hard in my Life🤦
pretentious
Dont u guys see rectangular bar under the finger print zone with the sunlight? It seems okay without the sunlight.
Privacy matter
Still rocking with my s8
Just bought an S10 plus and an XS Max to see the difference between them myself 😜
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=440">7:20</a> dark screen for more speedy functioning.<br>You are an idiot!<br>No one else needs that but samsung, tells you how randomly and quickly the devices are put together... Seriously, are you a moron?
1 word<br><br><br><br><br>Price
Alot of that stuff is on the S6
That&#39;s great regarding the fingerprint option. I install floor and my hand are always dirty and struggle to unlock phones.
I have the Note 8, and I see this.... and I don&#39;t know what life wants from me anymore.
Just waiting for galaxy note 10 unboxing
I&#39;m just curious about something this curiosity is solely for the women. Not saying this is me but some women do look different after they take off their makeup. So with the face recognition would it still work if we took off our makeup? 😂😂😂😂😂
I have the S10.<br><br>The only thing I don&#39;t like is the fact that it does not have the LED notification light so you don&#39;t know when u have a missed text/call or even when your phone is charging. I was thinking of converting back to the S9 but I guess I&#39;ll keep it.
After One UI (android pie) update Samsung galaxy s8/ s8 plus, s9/ s9 plus, Note 8/ 9, s10/ S10E/ S10 Plus does not have pro video mode (manual). So it is %%$##$ seless shit now!
you are crazy
so overall, do you like and recommend Galaxy S10?  I am about to purchase one now and just awaiting for some honest opinions...
Which brand smart watch are you wearing
You dont have to swipe after face recognition. Its in the settings.
One UI is trash. Wasted real estate, more swipes, more clicks. Looks like an iphone. I don&#39;t see anyone every using their phone with one hand.... subway, airplane, taxi, walking... all 2 hands. I want everything on the screen, not 2/3s of it. I dont need half the screen saying SETTINGS. No shit im in settings. I dont need to scroll past SETTINGS to get to the fucking settings. Samsung, go back to samsung experience and android 8.0.
Fav device.... Note FE. i like a physical button, and hate rounded screen corners.
Most of this tech you pointed out was available on my s8 active lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=296">4:56</a> - Wrong. iPhone does not need anything but a simple swipe up to unlock, using face id. By default, the screen wakes up when you pick up the device.
you are funny guy wahhaahahahaha
Srill honna use my iphone 9 who with me
Where can I get that yellow/orange wallpaper on the right?
People will complain in a year why diddent they wait for the s11 they always do
Still happy with my note9
A certain kind of business...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=507">8:27</a> 😂 hahahahah
This video only talks about the unlock functions and the night mode, not really a review, wasted time
I&#39;m still ok with my note 9. I love it.
Breaking News: Apple has decided to shut down due to Samsung +1 ing them
I got my s9 3 months ago , and after seeing this I don&#39;t want the s9 lol
what breed is Otis?
The double swipe down has been around for a while.
I literally learn nothing from your review. Really sucks.
I just got the xs max I switch from s9 but I got it cause I got the money to switch back and forth hahahha
You can change the way your phone behaves when using the Facial recognition. There&#39;s an option that instantly &quot;unlocks&quot; your phone, without you needing to actually swipe, thus avoiding the &quot;2 step verification&quot; :)
android xda
😂😂this guy
The only bad thing is that they provide you only 2 years of updates, i think now that&#39;s the only thing samsung should give attention to.
those who dislike, please comment your reason here:
My Galaxy s8 just got updated to One UI... I found out a glitch there.. All the call logs just get deleted on their own.. I can see just today&#39;s call logs, yesterday&#39;s and the day before&#39;s get deleted on its own... Please investigate if this is a problem globally
One hand pull down is on the Samsung S7 nothing new, you really waste a lot of time on this vide
Fortnite skin I got it for  1000
Checks for blood flow?! Cops all over America screaming Noooooo!!! Now they have to keep me alive to delete whatever I record b4 they kill me
My IPhone X turning into IPhone Ex
I agree, one UI really changed the galaxy experience, personally I love it!
News apple 20x gets rid of camera
Lou im very disappointed in you, Samsung has had the double swipe dropdown for years
My S9 is still great so, NO
Hej Lu, I can face unlock my S9 Plus with the new UI, even when the phone is locked. You say in your video the opposite about the S10 which I don&#39;t understand.
would have been a nice review if it werent for the gay undertones.
you&#39;re the one man
&gt;Ultra power saving mode is already a &quot;dark mode&quot; plus saves loads of power<br>&gt;UI is just the exact same except your quick settings are bumped down an inch<br>&gt;same useless &quot;unlock toy&quot; functionality for narcississts <br>&gt;same pile of shit infinity (very close at least) screen<br>Can we please get phones that actually do good shit? The S6 for fucks sake had the IR blaster in it so I could run my TVs and everything with it. Hell, the camera in it was even better than 97% of the new phones I looked at. Only reason I upgraded to the G7 was for power and storage alone. If my S6 had just the battery, cpu, and memory of my current phone, I wouldn&#39;t even dignify my current phone as a paper weight.
I&#39;m going to stick with my S8 plus for a couple more years.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=210">3:30</a> - Just an observation but did you know when a person scratches or plays with their ears when they make a claim it usually means they don&#39;t believe what they&#39;re saying; same when you purse your lips or bite your bottom lip. Works for lying too. It&#39;s called micro expressions and subconscious body movements. You may not have noticed yourself doing that but I did. New technology so I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re just unsure how good it is right now. :)
I&#39;m bored. Smart phones should be changing.... stuck
Apple releases a product then Samsung comes around and cracks their knuckles and tells apple to watch and learn every time😂
Your in your bag in this vid! 😂😂🤣🤣 Love it! Great vid bro
Samsung just took a bite out of apple
Hold your horses: another s10 is coming in 4 months with killer 5G.
Galaxy s7 gang where ya at wishing for an upgrade 🤧
He trying so hard to put the phone gently on the table😂
lol if you go on face unlock option you have ON / OFF for that &quot;after scan stay on lock screen  untill you swipe&quot; ... its up to you how u set it
Who Can tell the music name?
my 8 does the same thing
Should i buy the s10 plus or should I wait for the 5g s10 plus to came out, please help me , Thak you.🙏
So the fold comes out on April 26.   Why then are any of you tech fan boys buying an S 10?
Oh wow a different reading technology for your thumbprint and a updated operating system to make it just a little easier to turn on the flashlight. Think I will run out and spend a thousand plus and get one.
😂 you&#39;re a clown
Fanboys arguing in the comments are why i come to these videos. Thanks for the reviews Lew!
What is the difference between the E and normal s10? Can anyone tell me?
Phones have barely changed in the last ten years and yet people run out to buy a brand new one every year for $1000+.
Google pixel 2 XL already did it
I ordered the Samsung Galaxy S10+ in the white colour yesterday :-) iPhones have kinda gotten boring so thought I&#39;d try something different :-) and venture out of my comfort zone of iPhones and Blackberry&#39;s lol.
Anyone know if it still uses the curved edge like in the galaxy s7 edge?
This guy was annoying.
I just got my Samsung galaxy note 9 now they&#39;re an s10 WTF!!!
<b>Dude my old OnePlus 2 has most of them UI and its 4 years old. It cost me $300, probably get a newer one for $400 and would be 10x better than this phone.</b>
Unbox Therapy<br>@Unbox Therapy I guess you are just Unbox Therapy but just for a moment, would you consider an Afftbox Therapy? Not sure how that will affect your ins and outs, but i reckon you&#39;ll gain a few more subscribers. For example; I&#39;ve just move from my Samsung Galaxy 5s (which I&#39;ve have for years and had done me well until they &quot;updatded&quot; the software. Whatevs, I got a Huawei P20 Prp and it is a nice phone. The hardware is second to none (But you, being Unbox Therapy may no more), but I find the software lacks the natural intuition that came with Samsung. It&#39;s a bit like the PC vs Apple War. What is your opinion? Many Respects form the UK
All of this has been around since s7 edge and maybe even older... you can change bixby already. The swipe thing is already on older devices. Same thing as most phones same shit different camera
Someone be real... does the camera suck? My note 8 stretches my face. Most samsungs always did.
It sucks same shit need 2 more years to get something totally different,if the United socialist States of America doesn&#39;t crash first
U r smooth with the joke thats cool
being able to remap the bixby button like on can on my s7 active was actually one of the tipping points for me.
You are lagging behind reality...Double pull down list (first 2 minutes of video) exists since AGES...for example S9...
odd my poco have that second swipe for more settings and even let me choose wish buttons are there...
$1500 for an s10
Love your watch. What brand is it?
Oh thats hot
Did this guy always sounded like a New York stereotype?
Thie 1 UI is also on the s9, s9 plus and the Note 9 as well....
How many phones do you have now?
4Million views!!!
I&#39;m gonna buy this once my S7 finally craps out on me.
Lgv30 finger print is faster
Can someone tell me what kind of watch he is wearing? That watch is fire
I wish I could have it. 😭😭😭
Watching this video by the galaxy s10 lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=57">0:57</a><br>It’s not Mi, it’s Samsung
i can&#39;t wait to get mine
Apple have left the chat sadly:(
Someone help forreal!!! I pre-ordered the S10e but now I&#39;m leaning into the S10! Tell me why the S10 or S10e might be better. I just wanna know what others opinion are🙏🙏
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 love from Kuwait
The double swipe down function has been on android for quite a while..
lmao ultra sonic 🤣 saving the world . do what you please with them finger tips 😂😂😂😂😂
what I don&#39;t understand is why Samsung lunch a new phone when the Galaxy Note 9 is not even a year old, I am confused now that I was going to buy the note 9.
Nothing new same shit <br>With few more added things donot spend 1600 on this shitt wait for the price to comedown<br>See how much is s9 now is 700 only
I&#39;ve been configuring the bixby button for my own apps since they put it on there.
APPLE is still FAAAAAAR from bankruptcy smh
Power share?! The future is here.
Yo what&#39;s the background music???
U guys should open up a 24 tech hotline ..
By the powers invested me as a phone geek. I now pronounce you galaxy owners. You may now throw your Iphones away.
The Bixby button will open Google play music for me
Does Nike pay you to wear there merch? If not they should!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=252">4:12</a> 😂
Anyone else have bixby activate at the end of this video when he said Otis has a bixby nightmare!?!
Next phone will have 5 adjustable buttons
honestly i think ill be sticking with the S10+ for the next 4 years. phones dont have very much to offer now-a-days. <br><br>(Currently on Galaxy s9 plus)
The s10 is disgusting, it has a hole punch on the screen. What&#39;s the point in having the worlds best looking screen on a phone when there is a hole on the screen which spoils the visual experience.<br>I think I&#39;ll stick to my Note 9.
I&#39;m gonna stay galaxy s8 for another year.
im just happy it still has a headphone jack
Hey man I wanted to ask<br>What&#39;s the watch you re wearing called? Looks damn fantastic!
I&#39;m watching this on the s10
You&#39;re using the fingerprint scanner wrong....Don&#39;t press and hold.... Literally just tap your finger on it, it unlocks so much quicker 👍👍
Finger tips topic was really filthy dirty man.
Samsung: &quot;The Bixby button will be programmable in an updated.&quot;<br>Everyone: YAY!<br><br>Later...<br><br>Samsung: we will now update the s10 and S10+ <br><br>Everyone: that came out six years ago...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=60">1:00</a> yes you have it was for a OnePlus phone (eather 5t, 6, or 6t can&#39;t remember) you liked how the only difference were meaningful changes.
Still cant find a valid enough reason to evolve from the note 9
I have a galaxy s6 and I have that first UI
What about testing the new shift phone 6m?  It has a big future!
I use One UI on my note9 and, i love it but with gestures (when you hide the guides) it&#39;s perfect to use the big 6,4&quot; screen <br>And you can have unlock the screen without swipe, and you just take your phone, boom unlocked.<br>Just check the parameters
Literally my Moto z2 has the same pull down feature. I&#39;ve had this on phones like the Droid bionic which is a dinosaur now. And even the Droid turbo. This isn&#39;t new technology. It&#39;s been around for forever
Plzz make a review of the Samsung Galaxy A 50
These phones are fucking ugly the camera has to be in the middle no matter what
Samsung need to be punished for ruining a brilliant phone screen with a stupid and incredibly annoying pin hole camera.
Give me the Fortnite code for the exclusive skin that comes w/ the phone please 🤤😭😂
Great vids dude!
Fuck you
Why are people surprised or acting like changing animation speed/ scale is new? If you unlock developer mode then you&#39;d have that option anyway!
Nokia keypad foravah🖕🙌🖕🤙😂
I wanna get but my dad hates Samsung phones cuz of the apple ecosystem
I wanna get it but I’m stuck in the apple ecosystem
Can you show the ar emoji
one ui is just an emui clone
Amigo puedes poner subtitulos en español en tus vídeos
Which skin are you using for back cover?
You can turn off the swipe in facial recognition. Works brilliantly on my note 9. Faster than the fingerprint scanner in some cases.
My motoZ Force from 2 years ago has a secondary swipe down from the top for easier reach. You acted like that shit was a game changer lmaooo
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=83">1:23</a> - @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=210">3:30</a> I thought this feature have existed in years. I had Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and that feature exist. Except for the dark mode.
Nice vid <br>Samsung are going on another level!!!<br>Apple!where you at?🍎🍎🍎<br>Step your game up!
Not really different from the s9+ so far
What&#39;s the watch, you&#39;re wearing here?
I love it when people finally take night people/workers into consideration. I always have to put dark themes on. Even with the ui on my tv. It&#39;s less eye strain and saves energy
Anyone know the song in the background ?
Gilbert Gottfired (ranting and squinting) and Jay Leno (lisp and voice)..lol
It still has a chin??? No Thanks.
The s5 active has a programmable  button
Update is already live. I couldn&#39;t think of what I wanted it to be mapped to, so for now I have it setup to bring up my camera. Will probably change in the future but glad to have the capability to change it now
No my bubby getting greys 😭😭
Swapping from the iPhone XS Max to the galaxy s9 plus
lol I have the samsung j prime and I can swipe down the settings toolbar...
What kind of watch is that?
I hate that the glass is so thin on the s10 an s10 plus. It makes it not durable
One Ui update takes away pro mode video recording and draw and paint with s pen via advanced editor.
I love the s10+ it is insane, the features, the specs, everything. Just wow! Unbelievable, I hate the price. 1,600. I would have the finance option of 800 dollars that is a deal. I love the terabyte space and the better battery.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=297">4:57</a> You can change that two steps
Apparently ee wants £60 a month for the Samsung s10+ I&#39;m really dismayed today re phone pricing bought my iPhone 7 £45 a month and I thought that was high and full price £700 which was a lot 3 years ago today £1000+ seems standard today is a joke it makes me wonder will I be able to afford a new phone one day?
Can you do a skincare routine?
Other than the ultrasonic part, everything else in the first 5min sounds exactly like the S8
Wait, am I supposed to pay 1000$ for this? Samsung, note this: if you literally need to cut corners to launch a phone just because you still don&#39;t have the tech ready (to remove the chin and hide the cameras under the screen), then price it accordingly until you do. Even Apple shouldn&#39;t ask 1000 bucks on their phones, but at least they own iOS and a full eco-system, while this is just Android. I feel like everything inside this phone could be achieved 2-3 years ago and because of that, it seems outdated to me. Also, for 1000$ every year you&#39;d think that at least they could build new cameras with bigger sensors and wider apertures. But no.
the dirty hands or finger tips part is cray!!!!!!!!
Who also hates it when you eat a burito upwards your beans go to the bottom
<b>Samsung</b> - One Ui<br><b>APPLE</b> - WE HAVE CREATED all new iPhone 10X faster than usual iPhone
I am said ... Are you crazy 😂😂😂
The vivo, appo, xiaomi are better than S10, and its cheaper, and the technology is far away from S10
I hope someone will give me s10. 😍😍😍😭😭
Have you used eye makeup while filming? 😯
Can u gave mo only one
Oh my god do i have some
Im not a samsung fan, but apple products aren&#39;t that durable from my experience.
I want.
Night Mode, yes!!!
The One UI is a great software improvement
S10e
The front reminds me of the honor 20 phone from China......just saying
What so special about the reverse charging when mate 20pro had it last year?
Can I get a mobile device from you ..... please reply me.
Is that a Samsung watch?
All of the videos of s10 fingerprint scanner are wrong,just tap the area do not hold<br>and you will see how quick it is
Try go launcher for your android phones and customize your  home launcher. No need to smash on stock UI when you can download customizable UI for any android. and custom is ALWAYS better!
Interesting how you always praise Android in every which way, but when you talk about iOS you always seem to have a reason to criticise. I noticed this in one particular aspect: you criticise iOS, for example, for having a 2 step gesture for the unlock procedure, but praise One UI when you need the same 2 step to pull down the Notification panel to access everything.<br><br><br>Just an observation.
How about the front facing camera and how S10&#39;s version compares to the notch on other devices?
but seriously great channel man...I’m rewatching your videos a week later!!!🤩🤩
The best tech youtuber by far....👀after mkbhd of cause 😂😂😂
Pissed off I just got the S9
Smell the hype, TRUE RIGHT!<br>Different software?? I&#39;ll believe it when I see it!<br>This new phone may be a good lol show pony, but what about the software and apps that run the phone?<br>Samsung does not update it&#39;s software, BEWARE!<br>See my profile and watch a couple of videos that I have posted about the media player, smart switch, Auto Reconnect etc, YOU&#39;LL THINK TWICE!<br>Their customer service is full of very apologetic Customer service &quot;Team&quot; of &quot;Speciallist&quot; Excuse makers!
How about OxygenOS instead of One UI?
I&#39;m getting this phone and the iPhone xs max
From my point of view, someone who’s been using iPhone 5 for over 3 years, y’all look like spoiled rich kids 😑
Can you slide down from about halfway of the screen of the S10+ to open the notification/settings screen, or do you have to slide down all the way from the top? Not having to slide down all the way from the top of the screen would improve one-handed use quite significantly I think.
I guess I’m a biased Apple fan boy but I truly dislike that “hole punch” camera! I like the display a lot but that to me is a lot worse then the iPhoneX botch… I truly don’t mind having tiny bezels on the phone… like take the iPhoneX’s components in that notch… I think it’s entirely possible to fit all of that in a bezel that only takes up 2.5% of your screen real estate! A tiny edge to edge bezel at the top of the screen just slightly bigger then the speaker would be able to house all the FaceID sensors and 2 cameras! It would basically be an edge to edge display with all the bells and whistles squeezed in without having a notch or hole punch in the display… I might be the only one who feels that way but it would be much sleeker! Also to everybody who enjoys poking fun at Apple because of the lack of a headphone jack need to experience Bluetooth headphones! I don’t mean AirPods either! I was the same way, last phone I was gonna buy was the iPhone 6s and use it until it fell apart in my hands because I wanted a headphone jack… then I got a job on an assembly line where you could listen to music well you work, the only issue was wired headphones got caught on things and were ripped to pieces by the end of a shift. So I went out and bought a decent pair of Bluetooth headphones and I’ll never look back! I honestly wish I bought the next model up with noise canceling! Bluetooth headphones are the future!
Anyone can open your s 10 phone while you sleeping.. No need to cut thumb... Fingerprint sensor is not secure as compared to face unlock and password.. Mummy or gf or wife can unlock your phone when u sleep.. So be aware!!
The + on the sonic sensor is that you can tap it, and it works just fine. The long hold you do isn&#39;t strictly needed.
Updated my galaxy s9 to Samsung One ui and the newest version of Android. HUGE battery drainage!  Searched the forums and seems to be a bigger issue...
Ill stick to my s8, i love it. If you know how to look after your technology and have proper software on it to protect it from malware and all that bs, then you are absolutely set with android.
Soooo they put a iPhone 8 rear camera on the front ? Fuck One UI that revised touchwiz is still 🗑 why can’t they just give us stock android. Like who makes Android Software Google or Samsung ?
If i buy from Samsung directly Unlocked, can I use it on Verizon??
samsung: apple, hold my beer.
The amount of money Samsung wasted on sabotaging ads against notches. Now they wasted even more money for the R &amp; D to develop a &quot;zit&quot; for the camera/sensor. It&#39;s just as obstructive for viewing media. It&#39;s also a waste of screen space between the zit and edge of the screen.
Gotta love all the insecure android fucktards who have to mention Apple in comments. <br><br>Insecure much?? <br><br>Or Is Apple really that much in your head??? <br><br>😂
What watch you are wearing??
Your screen is going to have burn ins all over it by a month or 2 with your screen turned up that bright.
Galaxy S10+ with iOS would be the ideal dream phone for me.
Apple taking notes to release these idea in 2 yrs...samsung always a step ahead
Still lovin my note 8 waiting for samsung 12plus
You were very funny today, pal!! Hahaha 😜👍👍😊
Great vid as always. Keep up the great work.
Don&#39;t really understand the whole 5G thing
I JUST WANTED THE IKONIK SKIN AND EMOTE OH MY GAWD WHHYYYYYYY
Gotta hand it Samsung
Haha You&#39;re my favorite tech channel man
Note 9 new software update is similar, if not exactly the same.
Trash
I had a Samsung galaxy s7 edge and I didn’t like it at all. Would I like a new Samsung s10 or are they the same. I’m not sure if android really optimized between then a now. Can anyone give me input?
No note 10 ???? 😡😡😡😡
+Unbox Therapy thanks for this review yet another amazing fantastic review of an amazing Samsung smartphone. But I’ve googled the price point on these phones and the prices are outrageously ridiculously high bro.
Huawiei have been using the one handed use settings for ages, and they don&#39;t charge £1000+ for their phones
There&#39;s a setting called Motion Sensor which allows you to turn on the screen when you lift the phone up. I use it all the time with my S9 Plus and combined with facial unlock it&#39;s pretty quick that I don&#39;t rely on fingerprint sensors as much as I used to. You can enable this on the S10 lineup so there&#39;s no &quot;2 step&quot; authentication process.
&quot;Huhuhuhu well just skip another generation and introduce the iPhone XII!!!!! Bwahahahahaha&quot;<br><br>-apple
you&#39;re supposed to tap the fingerprint scanner not hold it down. the holding down slows it down
I think you need to change it in settings for the facial recognition, mine can unlock without even pressing the power botton.
The second swipe down came before the One UI which actually is pretty limited in comparison to its predecessor.
Theres an option for direct face unlock like oneplus
Ur not supposed to press down on for the ultra sonic sensor just place ur thumb on it
Very nice but just switched back to iOS. My GS8 on sprint was all kinds of not working properly. Apps crashing, old operating system and crap battery life. Amazing camera though.
Ok. These phone companies are getting ridiculous. Outrageous price tag for something that isn&#39;t much of an improvement from previous versions. Stop buying this crap and this crap won&#39;t cost so much.
SAMSUNG GALAXY S10+ 1TB <br>1599,99 €     :S
Love the one ui update on my s9plus big upgrade from old ui
Can I put a screen protection and still use the fingerprint scanner?
I hated the iPhone x face unlock swipe and now that Samsung has it...mmm I hope we can disable it
has anyone ever thought of getting two s10+&#39;s and using the power share with both and boom u have unlimited battery!!!!!
when he used to fingerprint scanner wrong<br>YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE OUR HERO!!....
I have it so it imediatly works and unlocks
I need a camera review of this bro
You plug it in to hdmi yet??
I have to say, the worst part of one ui to me was that swipe down feature. In 8.1 you would swipe down twice and it would bring your notifications down with it. Now it makes the notifications disappear and only presents you with the different utility options. I used that feature to either get rid of or go into notifications far more than I ever used it for those utilities. That ended up being a major hiccup in my workflow on my phone.
which watch you got? looks familiar to Gucci i-Gucci,. but it&#39;s not..
Assuming &quot;IF&quot; I am considering leaving Apple for Samsung again, I will likely wait and see what the Note 10 looks like.
Hey Lew, has one UI finally got as good as pure android? From what your stating, yes! The ultra sonic FPS reads your blood flow, yikes!
Dedicated Reddit button boi
U seem annoying
I hope samsung will put in screen transparent front camera in the next generation of S11. so there be not notch over the screen like samsung has done on samsung s10 in screen fingerprint
Huawei P9 also have double swipe thing? 🤔
please do the nokia pure 9
LG has been doing the secondary swipe down and dark mode for YEARS
Look at screen?! wow, the screen is literally around the camera lens. Wow.
I&#39;m to poor
Err… the 2nd pull down thing… I&#39;ve got that on my S7
You are using the ultrasonic sensor wrong
Woww, this makes more excited with what I ordered
Samsung is getting wiser now by studying and analysing Oxygen OS. 😁<br>Naming it &#39;One UI&#39; is their strategy to attract OnePlus fans, or users who are planning to lean towards OnePlus.
This guy is so cool 😎
just touch the screen to unlock don&#39;t press down with your thumb that delays the unlock process
review the LG G8 thinQ!
Oneplus has some of these features since Oneplus 5.
nokia9 plz
Man u don&#39;t know how to use fingerprint<br>Just make a quick touch
Came for the tech, stayed for the pup
Do unboxing video on the Samsung M series!!
unsubscribing... I love samsung but I stopped liking your way of presenting products...plus you scream a lot. da faq...
Sounds like someone is being paid by Samsung lol
That camera notch is disgusting, its like one giant dead pixel. <br><br><br>I can already feel the gay android nuts screeching about isheeps and promoting there gay androids. Why do i feel like android low lifes are the only ones who watch android and apple videos criticizing apple so they can promote a company that doesn&#39;t even know you exist, how sad.
Who else is watching on an apple product
There is a dedicated app for the Bixby button to do a different function for example I have my Bixby button set up to turn on my flashlight
Getting this phone because its probably going to be the last with a headphone jack :/ <br><br>Honestly dont know why they have this fetish of making phones thinner, never have I ever thought even once that my phone felt too thick.
But what kind of watch is that?
What is all the fuzz about that swipe?! I see this on nougat as well, am i crazy or what?
Nice phone, I’ll wait for the note 10 tho I love the pen!!
My Note 8 has the double-swipe notification bar. Am I missing why this is special on the 10?
BTW, Samsung pushed the UI from the S10 to the S9. Got it just a couple days ago.
Not gonna lie I’m over here with an iPhone X, I’ve always been a Samsung person and I’m super jealous my parents are getting this phone next week. Can’t wait till next year when I get it xD
AT <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=362">6:02</a> MY PHONE SAID “Battery Sufficiently Charged” AS SOON AS IT MADE THE LITTLE NOISE
What&#39;s watch brand is he wearing?
Help, what would u choose, the iPhone XS Max or s10+ ???<br>I have the Apple Watch and Apple TV:(
I got samsung financing so i got 3000$ credit do imma buy
Okay.. I just got one 😊 📱
Just preordered mine let&#39;s see how it goes. TBH the S9 sucked personally my battery is drained all the time despise cleaning my background apps and closing every opened window.
when you swipe down twice you can get all of your shit, my s7 does this, what&#39;s the big deal, i use it all the time it is a great
I am going to buy the s10 getting tired of s7 plus my camera lens shattered no flash sucks<br><br>would buy the new iphone but no headphones jack kind of turned me away<br><br>I think it costs 30 a month anyone know the release date?
You said the industry... I&#39;m a cook and gloves are always a thing. Does the fingerprint still work through latex or non-latex gloves? The s9 does read through latex and non latex gloves.
I am always going to be a fan of Galaxy&#39;s
Does anyone know if the s10 (hole punch camera) also illuminates around the camera like the s10 plus does?
A camera cutout is still a notch, prove me wrong.
Unfortunately, you got it wrong! You&#39;re using the fingerprint sensor wrong! It&#39;s ultrasonic fast and to experience how fast it is you should tap on it as opposed to holding down like older tech fingerprint technologies. Holding it down actually slows it down!
Razer phone has been using the swipe down for nearly two years.nothing new
I own the samsung galaxy A7
so a piece of shit like my s8
Why does it always feel like he’s yelling whenever he talks? Can you guys bring the mic closer to his head so that he doesn’t have to yell?
S10 5G is the final the future is here.
Phones Are Capable of so Many Things But I just Use The Camera and YouTube😅😅
One of your better videos!
Facelock was in Galaxy Grand in 2013 also lol.😂😂
you know that u can swipe down from the bottom also...u don&#39;t have to swipe from the top :)
DO SCREEN PROTECTORS WORK???????
You have the option to have 2 steps in face unlock or one(android)
Samsung already pushed out an update to Galaxy s9/s9+ phones to look just like how that s10 does. So if you don&#39;t care about the new gimmicks and own an s9 or s9+ don&#39;t bother with the upgrade.
I just updated my s9 to pie and now it&#39;s burning through battery so fast it&#39;s driving me crazy.   Also Google play services won&#39;t stop telling me wifi scanning is on even though I&#39;ve turned it off.   Wish I never updated
Please do a review on the Galaxy Buds of you can.
Give me a phone plss
wheres the notification light?
U jst need to touch the sensor to unlock.wndr y evryone is jst long pressing it??
this new finger print recognition is good for people with dry skin, for me phones often don&#39;t react to my finger print because skin has cuts because of dryness and it changes a finger print a bit so other phones strugle to recognise
I don&#39;t know why in Europe we are forced to bay the Exynox 9820 chip !
I will det this phone yet<br>Edit: Only in my fucking dream
Why&#39;s he getting hard over the notification tray dropdown?<br><br>Pretty sure every HTC phone i&#39;ve had did it
Please cc
I really hope  you DONT have to use the finger print to unlock this device as a only option ? Also I hope the mobile data quick toggle is returned . Miss it on my S8 ????
Donate one to a broke college student
configurable bixbi. google assistent, here we go
It goes faster when you just tap on it no need to hold it (fingerprint)
How should I get the sample piece or demo piece of new Samsung Galaxy s10 to explore it
Weather in Samsung not working👎
Shid good work sammy
<b>cough</b> one plus shows the shortcuts for settings in the same way already <b>cough</b>
I’m an Apple user but this phone is amazing. I would have got it but only 2 months ago I got a iPhone XR.
Please make a video of Nokia 9 Pureview .!!!!
what song is being used in the background ?
Face unlock doesn&#39;t seem up to par. I have an LG G6 from 2017 and it does face unlock from black screen, no swiping (unless you set it that way)
Old news man
Many tech reviewers are not aware that you need to press lightly on the in display fingerprint scanner for it to unlock at fast speed. If u use optical scanners like other phones then u need to press hard. Omg don&#39;t complain not fast enough when u are doing it the wrong way
You can hide the front camera by going to display then go to fullscreen app to hide the camera but cut the screen  a little
Haha, I have this feature available on my Pocophone F1 already, which I only purchased for $300 in comparison to Samsung 10 Plus, which is $900 US or more. So you&#39;re uninformed  regarding this feature which is already available on some of the cheapest devices.
What watch is he wearing?
can anyone PLEASE! confirm if the cámara cut out has LED notification? if i get a message and dint notice it will there be any LED light notifications?? thanks in advance.
Is this water proof?
I would rock with Samsung but they have a really weak ecosystem. All they really have is a good phone. If that’s all you care about then cool. But I want a good phone, tablet, laptop, and watch that works seamlessly together and makes sense. Apple does this the best. If Samsung did it better I would get Samsung. But they’re 1-dimensional.
First, Samsung did everything it possibly could to copy Apple’s iPhone and iPad. Then, it spent billions upon billions of dollars belittling Apple products in TV, online, and print advertising. Samsung spent years positioning its own devices as the cool alternative to Apple’s iPhone, and its efforts paid off big time. Even now, Samsung continues to copy Apple all the time across several different product lines. The latest example is Samsung finally deciding to dive into the years-old smart speaker market now that Apple is getting ready to release the HomePod. Apple copies Samsung and other Android phone makers all the time too, obviously. What’s odd and ridiculous, though, is every time we discuss Samsung’s long history of copying Apple, Android fanboys seem to lose their minds. Again, this is not a big deal. Samsung copies Apple. Apple copies Samsung. Toyota and Honda copy each other. Coke and Pepsi copy each other. Who cares? How could this possibly matter to someone enough to warrant hammering out an angry, misguided email to a complete stranger? It’s just so weird.
Get a rock climber to try the ultrasonic finger print sensor.  I remember I had issues after a 2 hour session I couldn&#39;t use my finger sensor.  I&#39;m in T.O.
Whatever happened to graphene batteries?
Yo! What&#39;s up with all the color banding!? Makes me think my TV is defective...
This is literally just a copy of oxygen os
To make ultrassonic fingerprint faster, its easy, just use in the right way, don&#39;t press the screen, just touch, same thing when setting it
How many guys are going to get this just so their girl cant get in there phone
I felt the same way about Samsung skins, terrible. It&#39;s the reason I went Pixel. But, the new skin is actually very good. Still has bloat BUT it also has features/functionality that I wouldn&#39;t want to be without. If Bixby died it would be near perfect. Samsung is definitely leading in both hardware and OS these days. I&#39;d imagine Google would have to start copying some of their skin features to keep up.
Imagine a world in which Unbox Therapy didn’t edit the bezels for the thumbnail
What kind of watch do you have?
Uhh, you could already remap the bixby button.  Who is this guy?
Apple used to be the company that was ahead of everybody else in the Tech market. Now they’re starting to fall behind, adding features to their products other companies have been having for years. I’m switching to Samsung, i have an iphone 6 right now and i refuse to upgrade past this model.
Bro say the truth
One thing off at least for me is that it&#39;s not all one solid color seems like the outer edges are chromed.. would like it to be all black.
The ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is not used correctly; instead of pressing the screen, touch.
Whats better s8 or s10 pluse... My s8 battery sucks now.<br> Dose not even last the day
Which watch is he wearing
The guy didnt use the ultrasonic fingerprint the right way!
they messed up iphone
I like the iPhone X androids are slow
The reason why the face unlock is 2 step is because it allows you to read the notifications on the lock screen without it instantly switching over to the home screen.
S10e don&#39;t need the extra wack stuff. Dope background music my dude.
Your unlocking it wrong tho. <b>You should only tap the screen for the fingerprint</b> don&#39;t hold/press the screen as that changes the thumbprint and there by making the scanning take a bit longer
It looks like it&#39;s left to me to tell him that the secondary down swipe on the notification bar is not new. Also manipulating transitions. He just seemed so excited about something that&#39;s on older Galaxy devices.
Can you explain why someone would buy a T-Mobile carrier phone vs an unlocked phone? Both are sold directly from Samsung, and I don&#39;t understand why anyone would buy the carrier version.
should i go for Samsung Galaxy S10 or huawei 20 mate pro?
What is Apple gonna do!!
Try the foldable Samsung smartphone which can turn into a 7.3 inch tablet
Good phone but still not getting it sry
you using the fingerprint  wrong
Big mistake to buy a high end phone now!<br>I`ll wait for the 5G phones, if i`m about to upgrade and keep my phone for the next 2 years, the best upgrade is a 5G Phone!
Lew your people is using the ultrasonic fingerprint <b>*Wrong*</b>
The Pixel 2 already has this type of GUI for a while, nothing new.   I kinda dig the screen finger print sensor.
God I want one so bad. But I also want 4-5 year software updates. Literally the only reason I still want to buy iPhones
Funny how Apple users don’t say shit about android but android users instantly diss Apple. I mean they’re right to do it but it’s still annoying as fuck
In the face I&#39;d you don&#39;t have to swipe up after it fors it like on an iPhone. It&#39;s a setting called &quot;stay on lock screen&quot; or something like that which you can turn off in the face Id settings.
Great videos Lou!
Can you get IKONIK SKIN on fortnite for me with this phone please😭
Or help my mom for blind  person
The Bixby button  is more for if you dont want to touch  your phone
Lol  your dirty  fingers
I love  dark mode on my note 9
Can you do review for Sony Xperia 1? Thank you
Meh, it still has a chin...
great vid
Wtf won&#39;t Apple make a night/dark mode yet
After 8 years, 2019 is the one i will switch to Samsung. Apple got stuck in 2015.
I MUST HAVE THAT PHONE!!
3,300 jealous iPhone users.
the moment when u are so broke and you have to start a funding campaign to buy a phone😭.... link below
Was thinking about getting whatever new iPhone comes out this year since I&#39;ve gotten android phones every time but definitely trading in the s9 for the s10 plus
Rock climbing!! My iPhone 5s fingerprint reader was trash anytime I went rock climbing. Would be very interested to see how well it works with chalk covered hands
Prebooked s10e prism black i just love it !! Btw i love the way u talk and explain everything seriously bro u r insanely awesome love ur videos 😊😊👍🏻✌🏻
Bruh night mode is android 9. Lol
My s8 does the same thing
huawei&#39;s mate20 pro got the reverse wireless charging first :))
This Apple vs Samsung war got to stop. Same thing with ps4 and Xbox
Double swipe? Oh, you mean like I&#39;ve been doing on my Pixel ever since it came out 2+ years ago? Eh...
Thats a BIG step towards showing Trust and Support in there Customers and the Consumer. Huge play on there behalf.
Should I get s10 or s10 plus?
I live in the Netherlands and can asure because of the shitty rainy weather, wet fingertips is an actual problem when you&#39;re outside
you have a huge channel, will you please inform people of the dangers of 5g ?<br>allmost everyone talks about 5g like its cool and like its no big deal and its already comming, while its radiation is kown to be VERY DANGEROUS for our health... <br>they should NOT go on with 5g untill serious diseases can be cured easily...
Unbox the S10? Everybody is doing the S10+...thanks Lew.
My s7 has quite a bit of burn in on the screen. This s10 I hope the screen will be more resistant? Or do they all eventually end up like that
I&#39;m a Samsung fanatic but I&#39;m not digging that hole punch...
Yes, don’t buy the Samsung 10+<br>iPhone XR is better although I have an iPhone 6 and I still can’t get it because apparently 13 is too young to be able to get the newest phone. Arhhhhhhhh😡😡😡😡
I bought the iPhone X for no fucking reason
Does S10 support quick charge or power delivery.. Buying a power bank so want to know
You and Otis excel in comedic timing my friend
Android pie is the worst piece of trash devised. Oreo was way better. Everything looks like a clone of iOS now. You have to zoom with the camera with 2 fingers instead of one. It takes longer to split screen apps. It&#39;s just horrible.
Still using my Galaxy S5 until it fails on me
does this come with a screen protector like people have said??
Should  of talked about  the cameras front and back :/
Hope i get one
Hey man love your show, i remember a while back I asked you for advice on upgrading my Nexus 6 and you gave me some solid suggestions but I&#39;m thinking this is the one man....this is it!
Samsung: First Sonic sensor<br>Apple: 2 years later,  we created fingerprint in screen
dude your videos are terrible recently
<b>Apple has left the chat</b><br><b>Samsung has joined the chat</b><br><br><br>Samsung: &quot;Get out a here apple u ain&#39;t have these things like me
well its samsung so its crap, so no its not &quot;the one&quot; next.
NOKIA 9 PURE VIEW PLEASE
This guy is so annoying
being able to hide the s10 camera hole in the display settings is an awesome option. esp when u want to play a game or watch videos. least the options there when u dont want a hole in your windscreen when your driving. i mean playing a game or youtubing. just a shame u loose a chunk of the screen when enabling the option.
I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing with your fingertips... I almost lost it at the coffee shop. haha this is gold.
Google UI already has the two swipe notifications page, as well as the dark mode. Did you even review the pixel?
I wonder how VR will work with the new hole and pill punch out display
Does the s10 have a non curved screen? Did anyone have a curved screen and it break? I have a s7 flat. Drops without case and no cracks or breaks.
Hype is real
No more Notification Light? :(
What watch is that?
My s9 dose the same thing
Goodbye Apple Hello S10 plus.
Let’s see what Apple has to offer this year.
unboxing mi 9 PLEASEE...
Please get your hands on Sony Xperia 1
You had the double pull down on the note 8
The Galaxy Fold is the one.
Th e wireless charge does it work on other phones beside that like say u need to charge ur s 10 can you use another phone as a power bank
IOS &gt; ANDROID <br>S10 &gt; ANY IPHONE THAT IS OUT RN
Is it just my friends that grab my phone while I’m asleep, unlock it with my fingerprint, and text other people from my phone?
How much did Samsung pay you?
crypto key storage built in
Wait for the Note 10. Or next gen Galaxy Fold if it had a larger front screen and smaller inside notch.
Pre-ordered. Looking forward to even better camera features than my S9, along with more RAM and Powershare.👌
Keep your green texts to yourself!
You should talk about the crypto wallet
Ummmm when he was talking about the issue where you have to swipe up after face unlock, that&#39;s not necessarily true, I have the s9+ and Everytime I open the screen, when it sees my face it automatically goes into my home screen, it&#39;s in the settings, and it&#39;s at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKjLzlc-hY&amp;t=314">5:14</a>  where I&#39;m talking about
At this point... it’s just a phone
Sir can you give me some S10 if it is release in the market. Please, as my birthday present because my parent doesnt afford to buy one ☹ thank you in advance ❤ God Bless More Power
I have the Note 8 and its still like new. No need for a new phone yet. I will never understand why people have to have the newest items when theres really nothing better about it from the last phone. But people will believe whatever sales people tell them.
I have the s9+ and I just got the update to the new UI. This video just made me so happy. I&#39;ve been so pissed at this new UI because of all of the little here and there are things that I couldn&#39;t figure out, I feel like this explains it all. Oh yeah, and dark mode; praise the Lord they have a dark mode!🥰
TRACK NAME?
Thumbs up for Otis and Bixby button remap.
People complain about the most stupid shit........... Touchwiz wasn&#39;t all that different. And most os&#39;s are practically the same!
I use the Microsoft Launcher so I don&#39;t care what Samsung does to skin the phone.
As an iPhone XS user, not going to lie the S10 seems pretty good. Just not a fan of the lesser security. None the less, awesome phone :)
Most painters can&#39;t use the finger print sensor so it just doesn&#39;t work for us it useless feature almost
About the OnePlus face unlocking. There is an option to choose whether to unlock immediately, or to swipe up to unlock.
This is probably not &quot;The One&quot; just another in a long line of slightly different phones.
Impressive but I&#39;ll stick with my S9+. Especially now it&#39;s got the same operating system as the S10
Is this phone stronger than my Chevy S-10? Hmm
My S9 plus has all that.
Apple has left the galaxy
Can anyone please tell me the prices?
I have the s10 it’s AWESOME
Hey Lou, how about you give us a review on that Polar Vantage watch you&#39;re wearing.
Samsung beat Apple to dark mode 😭
Apple sucks Samsung Galaxy is way better watch iPhone try to copy something from them
The Bixby button may be the reason I decide to get a phone outside of samsung and i&#39;ve owned every galaxy ever made except for the s4. Damn that Bixby button. Damn it to hell!!!
2 days left for mine s10  to unboxed
My favourite it&#39;s Huawei Mate X!
Please can someone do a review of the normal S10 and not the S10 plus. It&#39;s like the normal version doesn&#39;t exsist.
is it worth giving my samsung s9 plus for 300 euros and get the s10 e for 450?? Or instead getting the s10 for 600 euros but with the ear buds included???
U can make go strait to the home screen when unlocking with your fac in settings/biometrics
Nahh apple better 🤝
&quot;I buy these phones for the software&quot;, said no one ever.<br><br>The Note 8 does this too......WHAT?!
Im still upset about the change to ub-c i miss the days of being able to find a micro usb charger with almost anything else you buy
Samsung galaxy A5 2017 has the secondary swipe as well
Sounds like that phone has a whole bunch of baked in security and privacy vulnerabilities.  No thanks.
They should have never removed dark mode. I remember buying S4 like that back in the day when the Android UI was only black. LOL
Certain kind of business hahaha
The secondary swipe is a feature on all galaxy phones correct me if i&#39;m wrong? I had a galaxy S4 and that same feature was there
who&#39;s here to check out the phone iKON got given by the ceo in Singapore😂😂😭
Favorite phone the BlackBerry q5
Does only s10+ has the lightening effect around the front camera on unlock?
I kept thinking you were talking about the chevy s10 every time you said s10
I regret getting the iPhone XS Max 😕
Not the one. - Zathras
why am i still stuck at iphone 😭
Man you can change the swipe up thing for face recognition in settings
Waiting for mine 😍
Xperia 1 by sony unbox this device
Do sony xperia 1
I&#39;d say my htc u12+ face unlock works faster
HTC
Is instagram and snapchat camera better?
Look at that icons..............shit as hellcan we change it previous ones?
Mac Miller therapy
S10 feels way to early
Apple will have X-ray machine for sure.
Do a review for nokia 9 pureview penta camera is here man!
Hey lew, make a review on he Nokia 9 and the xperia 1, it&#39;d be great
Nice! Where&#39;s the accessories for the S10?
Should have waited for S10 now stuck with bad battery life of S9😭
what case are you using
It only took 6 years for stock Android to finally take simple features from cyanogen mod
Cell phones r getting out of hand they are not worth the money they are getting tooooooo...high in cost
You can change a setting so you don&#39;t have to swipe after face unlocking.
I just got an s9 i shouldve of waited
Whaat is the &quot;Available&quot; date for the S10.  And - How do you get 3.7 million views with no comments?
all those UI features that you say you like on the new Samsung One UI exists on your current phone already... OnePlus 6T..
Hope my comment makes sense... <br><br>I just recently, like a day ago broke my daily phone. Pulled out an old LG G Stylo. I have come to find out that we are all taken for fools. This almost 5 year old phone is blowing my mind. <br><br>There is absolutely no need for the phone to be as crazy and so who ever takes the time to read this please understand that you&#39;ve been fooled. Now go and spent a $$$$$$$$$ for a phone. Lol.
As is customary these days, Samsung is <b>way</b> ahead of Apple who must be tearing their hair out in despair with their notches, ugly designs, slow face unlock and camera humps! <br>Does anyone know whether the S10 can be opened without picking it up, or activating the power button...a limitation on the One+ 6T?  If it can and you could eventually assign a &quot;silence&quot; option to Bixby, a-la mute switch on the iPhone making the switch would be even <b>more</b> tempting for me! 😉👍
Xperia 1 is better
Can someone tell me the difference between stock and a skin. What. Is the diffrence. If it comes on the phone how is it not stock.. iam kinda new to android.  I did use Apple but then realized I was missing out on a way better product.  So I said good buy to my I-phone x and got a note 8 and made $300 profit. It&#39;s also a better phone. But any help is appreciated.
What watch is he wearing? Garmin?
I think the only thing samsung doesn&#39;t do is screen record or am i wrong??
The Bixby button to me is a waste of space.
<b>*talking about fingertips*</b> : If youre in some kind of ..business...that uses dirty fingertips....*<b>zooms in awkwardly*</b> 😂😂
I’m convinced that kids should first get an android device and later on change to Apple iPhone 📲
absolutely love my S8, using for like 2 years still going ham. I don&#39;t think worth a upgrade tho, perhaps when S11 comes out totally notchless, it def worth an upgrade.
Im gonna sell Battery to drunk people. jepp. 10$ each 1%.
Dude you&#39;re presenting it as is the next best thing since sliced bread. Try Asus ROG Phone
I see that Jim Cramer is no longer picking stocks instead is focused on cell phones.
My only question is has Samsung fixed burn in issues?
Samsung listen to their customers  samsung finally let us choose any application that we want by pressing buttion.
Yes one ui is way better than TouchWiz and also it has some settings other didn&#39;t have.<br>Allover s10 plus is beast <br>Like if you love s 10 plus
You can change the settings for face unlock so it unlocks straight away..
Changing the Bixby button to a different app is amazing.
Why Samsung is using exynos in india not snapdragon ??
How is this dude so popular? This is the most unhelpful and dim-witted tech video I&#39;ve ever seen.
So does it work with snatch juices on my fingers or not?
We need phones under 5”
Might be the one to make me switch to Android
Apple has joined the chat 💭
So if you turn on powershare on both phones do you get unlimited power?
Still like apple but I do really like this device. I just wish I could try the device for a week to see if I would like it better than a iPhone
samsung Galaxy S hole
