Wow, that is incredibly beautiful music, also colorful background, very cool. I also like in one of the shots the change in the look of the eyes, also the colors. I think it&#39;s an unforgettable moment that it&#39;s hard not to notice, I really liked it, Demi you&#39;re well done.

Satan is not allowed to talk to shawnda. Shawnda sounds like the name of a person.
I’m not a demon. But I want satan to be murdered more than I was. I want him to suffer the way he thinks people should suffer for him. And I don’t want anyone to suffer for satan.
I don’t like the way the singer looks but the song is ok.
Love neon light ❤❤❤

Who’s here october 2022
Not many of their songs were charted on Hot 100&#39;s top 10, but trust me, Demi&#39;s songs are the worldwide biggest hits!!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9uDwppN5-w&amp;t=207">3:27</a>
And he began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower, and leased it to tenants and went into another country. <br>When the season came, he sent a servant to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. <br>And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed. <br>Again he sent to them another servant, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully. <br>And he sent another, and him they killed. And so with many others: some they beat, and some they killed. <br>He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, They will respect my son.<br>But those tenants said to one another, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.<br>And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard. <br>What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others. <br>Mark 12:1-9 ESV
It sounds so similar to dynamite
I love her voice 💄
Neon lights! 😼✨💕
Imagine being so gorgeous, blessed in so many ways and you just fuck it up. I miss the old demi, I miss demi and Selena&#39;s friendship so much

These terrorists Lukini, Shainurovi, Ahmatnurovi from Perm, Mitini from Moscow,  Ahmetov from Alicante, Zenkovi from Perm, Morozovi from Moscow, their band stole digital copy of my body and my voice for making easy movies and songs to feed their terrorists group. Never publish their movies with  heads of their team members attached to my body. I never gave them any right to use digital copy of my body and my voice for making their movies or music. They must be in jaiL. I want them to get exradition....

Search up Bay of Plenty Showquest 2022,  the show quest i did (mokoia intermediate) we used this song for our introduction with wendy darling, peter pan, and tinkerbell. We got 1st place partially because of creative songs, dynamics and choreography. Love this although I was 2 when it came out.
Hoje me deu saudades desse Hinoo 😍😍💙 mais alguém em 2022?? 🤷🏻‍♀️💙🔥

The Rapture<br><br>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.<br>1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events.<br>Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life.<br>I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live.<br>Deuteronomy 30:19 R.M<br><br>WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?

I&#39;m sorry
A copy of “Be the one” Neyo 2012.
I love the track would loved to see the dancers shuffling with all the neon all over them would looked gold . My daughter and a few of her friends came through that dance era . Actually think it would have suited the dance track too. But hey I&#39;m just one woman in the whole world full of great ideas .
This song is the best :) (G28) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKqspE1eI8g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKqspE1eI8g</a>
I like demi she has a high voice
Seriously do you have anything better to do? I am here for your amusement. Hopefully, you all got through! I get to go home ALONE thank God...:) Let me go and don&#39;t ask for anything else that isn&#39;t given to every regular Joe
Não precisava largar o POP, podia ter ficado com os dois, POP e ROCK.
Wow amazing Party song!🎉❤️
awesome                                   sings

Extrañó mucho este tipo de música en 2022
Missing Demi&#39;s song like this 🥺
<b>this song was part of my childhood and I miss it so much</b> 😭
This song is eight years old?? EIGHT??!!!
2013, 2014 y 2015, sin duda alguna esos fueron los mejores años de mi vida, incluyendo rolitas cómo estás en mi vida❣️😢, que ganas de regresar en el tiempo 😭😞❣️
Alguien más en pleno 2022?

Yo boy a comprar una cosa para darme el placer yo misma
Yo no se que es el cariño nunca e tenido a alguien que me enceñe lo que es el cariño yo cuando estoy muy mal de la deprecion me encierro para mi seguridad para no hacerme daño yo misma yo escucho tu musica y me calmó te lo juro que yo  puedo aguantar la condena por amar a quien quiera soporto golpes soporto de todo y me da igual  pasar golpes y palomas me vasta con tener esperanza te juro que voy a  hir a por todas de mi lovato y que ya basta de aguantar que te peguen ya basta de aguantar homofobia por que te gusten cosas diferentes ami no me importa el género que sea da igual que sea chica chico o trans eso da igual todos tenemos el mismo derecho de amar y ser amada y ojalá alguna chica o chico o lo que sea me encuentre y  quiera conocerme y lo que surja yo tengo esperanza de encontrar  a alguien que me enseñe lo que es el cariño  y la ternura deberdad es triste que una niña joven como yo este sola pero yo boy contra todo ahora nadien me para y voy a por todas vasta ya de aguantar  todos somos iguales y tenemos derecho de amar y si quiero besar a una chica em la boca lo hago o sino me tomo mi placer con mis propias manos
Tus canciones me relajan y boy a enpesar a dejar el alcohol  yo se que yo puedo hacerlo y lo voy a hacer por ti demi lovato  tu eres mi esperanza
Me encantan las canciones de demi lovato gracias  a ella pude salir del armario este año  y las canciones las escucho todo el día y si me dieran a elegir cual es mi cantante favorita es deli lovato mi favorita ella es la única cantante que me encanta de verdad que demi lovato tiene pinta de ser una buena persona y llo le agradezco a demi que aya sacado la cancio  cool for the summer si lo lee quiero decirle que  es una persona maravillo y que gracias por ayudarme si mudarte cuenta  si tu supieras demi lovato que cuando le dije a mi madre  que soy pansesual y aparte no me siento ni como mujer ni como hombre di tu supieras lo que me iso me pego me iso un moratón en las costillas y me dio una paliza pero yo la encare como podía le puse cool for the summer  y la encare y si hubiera tenido a algún chica para besarla de lante de mi madre lo hubiera echo pero no tenía a nadien yo te juro demi lovato que me has cambiado la vida no tendré a nadien de mi familia pero si puedo tener lo que me guste da igual el género que sea yo te juro que  si tuviera a alguien que me diera un habrazo quisa lloro pero bueno da pena que una niña de 20 años como yo este sola sin trabajo son familia sin nadien que le pueda decir necesitas un habrazo  demi lovato e caído en una deprecion con anciedad y neon mucho alcohol y por la noche no duermo por la anciedad y la deprecion por que me da hormigueo y me derrumbo y lloro sin nadien que me de un habrazo y me  consuele  me habrazo sin que nadien me mire  y la verdad es que cuando concigo dormir es cuando escucho tus canciones que me relajan  la verdad es que bebo para no sentir dolor  pero lo peor es que no tengo amigas ni amigos es lo peor de todo pero gracias a ti me ciento contenta  gracias a tu alegría gracias a tu belleza y gracias a tu musica puedo poner la mente en blanco y me dejo dormir gracias por ser una persona maravillosa no se como devolverte lo agradecida que estoy con tigo  por cambiarme la vida y enseñarme que cuando ay tormentas viene la calma yo creo que se como agradecérselo te voy a decir una sorpresa voy a dejar de beber alcohol y ojalá que lo leas demi lovato lo voy a hacer por ti  si yo fuera tu amiga seguro que seríamos íntimas amigas leales y que no dicen cosas confidenciales me gustaría algún día poder ir a algún concierto tuyo algum día ❤❤❤❤❤❤ de mi parte

Acabo de ver CLEAR BANDIT (SOLO)...Y ME SIGUE GUSTANDO MUCHO...🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Daqui a pouco essa musica vira febre no tiktok, anotem ai.
i remembered how my 7 years old ass got into emergency room cause of the liquid inside the glow in the dark sticks, i secretly bought a lot of it then i put it all over my body, my lips and i accidentally swallowed it causing for me to have a hard time breathing <br><br>and after it, this song is prohibited to play in our house 😂
9:08 PM

This brings me back to the eighth grade (2013-2014 school year).
Hi Demi xoxoxo
Love you always Demi! I remember listening to most of your songs while I was in middle school through high school. You still rock! 🎤

Hi Demi
Zovi policiju
Izbaci ga iz kuci
Obuci se toplo izadji
Za zivce
U hladnu vodu uleci
Čujem ti mene ne čuješ moram da ti pišem opust se
Volim i ja tebe
Sapuni mi nesto
Volim te Lovato sestro
Idi kod Britni Spirs da je smiris
Srbija gruza crno beli kačket naočari braon plave oči belac vrata zelena majica Boston 5 Kevin Garnett
Gledaj moj profil na fejs buku
Spremajte se dodjite u Srbiju kamuflirajte se polako kao klosari ponesite pare dinari
Demi ti si mi sestra Madona mi je majka zovi YouTube za brisanje mojih komentara gleda ceo svet volim te sestro zovi familiju pricaj
Hold on, she&#39;s only 21?! I&#39;d give her 35 at least...

Que nostalgia
Hello 2022 🎉
anyone remember the floating away from your bullshit meme, right after she posted this video? Iconic.
I love Demi Lovato
You can tell Demi wasn&#39;t feeling confident with her body in this video. She doesn&#39;t dance or show below her waist. Just in that dark silhouette shot. I wish I knew this before so I could leave a message to encourage her. Sorry Demi.
Tinha 14 anos quando essa música foi lançada, é da minha adolescência, amo. Demi Lovato canta demais slk, bem balada, alto astral, daora esse clipe. Continuo ouvindo como se fosse pela primeira vez 🎶🎧💜

I love the video but I wasn&#39;t feeling the song, there were wayyyyy too many songs that sounded similar when this came out with the same lyrics, same themes, it was tiring year after year. Demi always kills whatever genre she does though!

I don&#39;t know exactly how musicians of this genre and caliber of play earn money. I sincerely hope they earn what they deserve so this music can have a shelf life.

2 weeks ago l contracted the Covid 19 virus.I walked in the hospital and was placed on the ventilator 3 days later.<br>For a week I was on the ventilator.<br>I&#39;m also a Registered Nurse and a veteran at that.During that time I had one on one encounter with God himself.<br>He also would send angels that hovered over me day and night.God raised me up like Lazarus.<br>I&#39;m forever grateful to my mighty great God.Hallelujah!!!!!!
