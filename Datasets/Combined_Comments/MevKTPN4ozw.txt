Sell elucid to grimes and or tesla come on he loves his rockets to much
The way Elon talks is like he&#39;s from the future and he&#39;s trying not to say something that might disrupt the space time continuum.
I doubt Marques would do this interview today. Elon went more conservative, and Marques tends to only interview left wingers.
I would love to see an interview like this nowadays. His interviews with larger news orgs and platforms seem so different now, I&#39;d love to see in a smaller setting if he&#39;s like the old Musk.
you need a new interview with Elon :)
Tesla needs to improve range and charging speed and availability of chargers

Export the Q*, Chat GPT, Revit, Plant 3D, Civil 3D, Inventor, ENGI file of the Building or Refinery to Excel, prepare Budget 1 and export it to COBRA. Prepare Budget 2 and export it to Microsoft Project. Solve the problems of Overallocated Resources, Planning Problems, prepare the Budget 3 with which the construction of the Building or the Refinery is going to be quoted.
Nice. I would like to know more about the teams which work with Elon Musk. How they execute their plans. How they execute projects. How they deliver value.
Made the new microscope to riset deeper than atom
I worked at a plant that makes Transport Truck springs.  The General manager was absolutely clueless about everything.  My one boss told me that he didn&#39;t even think we ever made scrap parts.  We did, quite a lot actually but the bosses are so scared of the consequences that during the night, they&#39;d dump all the scrap bins out into the big bins and the truck would haul them away before big boss man shows up.  The guy was an absolute clown!  I like everyone usually and put up with a lot but this one boss really was useless.  Thinks he&#39;s a genius.  I see Elon and just laugh in my head.  He&#39;s the real smart one! :)

👍👏
Incrível entrevista muito esclarecedora informação e vida nos liberta podia fazer uma nova para atualizar sobre o tema grata por poder assistir sucesso sempre
Seemed much more interested and knoweledgeable in this business than Twitter. All about cult of personality now.
I love Elon. Smartest human being.
I thought he was racist lol doesn’t his factory have a segregated location called the “plantation” where only blacks work and he told African American workers to “get thicker skin” when he was told of the countless reports of n-words being used on employees and rampant racism allegations
Elon is the best.

Can you take the mirrors off and replace them with a small video screen and cameras?
Wow this was 5 years ago. Time for a refresh! I want to see where they&#39;re developing the Tesla Bot, the unique assembly line of a Cybertruck, prototypes of the &quot;unboxed process,&quot; if they plan on using the bot for the unboxed process or if that&#39;ll be in gen 2 unboxed factory, I wanna see the semi truck production line, the 4680 cell line -- all of these things haven&#39;t really been seen by anyone but Elon would probably take you on a tour.
My son loved this video
I wonder of elon can speak Afrikaans...
This video did not age well.
Elon musk before he lost his brain to Internet politics
Remember when Elon wasn’t a total psychopath?
I miss this version of Elon
Нас бы раздавили те кто против тех кто против нас?
Атомоход. Для boring
Elon Musk: It may sound crazy, but I know how to stop the flooding from HURRICANES and save the US a lot of money. Doing this will make Insurance Rates Drop and let people be able to afford Insurance once again. People don&#39;t need the hardship of losing everything.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=90">1:30</a> 4 years later and he buys Twitter.
major respect for how non-agressive you were with Elon. <br><br>excellent interview marques.
❤❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=95">1:35</a> Hmm I really wonder why people think he spends time on Twitter....X?
What a great interview
People see &quot;awkward and stuttery&quot; i see someone confident and relaxed to say what he truly wants to say.
He said 25k car in 3 years.. its been 5. Wheres my 25k car elon!! Jk lol
Он этого не говорил!
Dude what is that into song?
5 years today 😅❤
5 year ago wow🤯
Hi
&quot;elon musk pays full price for his own cars&quot; does it really affect him, like even 1%
Elon musk height
Tesla is my favorite ride
Great video.
he is an alien
Do an interview with a philosopher who works with AI. Plz…
Elon musk is amazing
If Elon never had a dime, I would want to hang out with him, (it wouldn’t take long for him/us to figure out how to get what we need/want, and we’d have a blast doing it, 💕😁)…he’s amazing, in so many ways!!!💕
Its so funny to watch this guy, his brain literally moves 20 times faster than what his mouth is able to say. For better or for worse, this dude is on a whole nother level intellectually. Respect where its due.
Sound quality is not mkbhd level
Nice interview with Elon
Whos here in 2023😂
bromakesnosences
Some people think he has biggest brain in the world lol😂 are you one of them?
I congratulate you for how much  humble you are in front of Elon, most YouTubers would have gone crazy
Marques,<br><br>Also, please get in touch with Elon Musk again! Specially get those Tesla Cars and their factory in improvements.<br><br>Couple of biggest improvements they&#39;ve ever made. Has there been shift in any of the company goals?<br><br>Specially - Social Media and how is our current age evolving and what future is going to be like? What is going to be most important thing that would decide our destiny as Human to Human interactions and their impact on our ability to achieve or destroy?
Why do he look fake
Elon says uuhm more than 100 times in this video.
we&#39;re all nerds here XD
I miss the Elon of 2018 lol
Variant of Kang The Conqueror
NOT WATCHING THIS; ONLY WANT TO SAY THIS GOSPEL MESSAGE: REPENT, FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND.
Marques gets an interview with Elon. Nuff said.
AVP <br> yeah I  is/ they  slacked off /  but   cool /   soem   is  fromth e creates / but ,.../   and  now the   class action /  /  no it&#39;s cool/ I  bet /   semi  ,. /    no I  get that / ,../ and / /    soon // you too ?/ cool/ /// I  bet /  let me  know /
It’s sad how much respect we had for Elon here. Now, four years later, he’s like a supervillian.
I almost thought that this was clickbait
NICEEEEE
Watching these old interviews is a good example of “perception becoming reality”<br><br>Everyone thought his inarticulate half thoughts were signs of an eccentric genius… now they just appear to be what they are… improvisational babbling by a guy who kinda just got lucky.
Funny he says it’s it like I’m always on twitter now he bought twitter 😅
Basically Elon does everything at his Factory while his employees just watch him doing everything
It’s so cool to watch MKBHD help inspire and give a shout-out to smaller companies like Tesla 😊
Boosting this videos algorithm as much as I can by commenting
This mf truly has a God complex
DUDE YOU TALKED WITH ELON MUSK YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤<br>ELON MUSK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
Love Elon Musk.. he&#39;s a genius.. just seems like a super cool guy❤️
Who is here after Elon musk is world&#39;s richest person ❤
❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
J’adore mr Elon Musk il a toujours raison (surtout sur tweeter)
This video was made back when Elon was cool... Crazy how time flies!
The planet is our common home! Who let this guy ruin the whole ecology with the explosion of his space rockets? We are residents of Germany, against it!
Great
Good questions
what an amazing innovator Elon is - truly one in a generation
I won&#39;t buy it simply because I don&#39;t want one company to monopolize and have my info/ bio.
Magnetic target precison would work, there are tools and bolts all over the place, but I will figure it out with time, nothing to do... Thanks for sharing, nice video... Stay safe..
Why do I make this comments, just like challenge, and to feel better about myself and the stupid waste of potencial of my life....
If an aligaror snap.. Snap can bite, so can a ar gun get it with a racket,, dim.. Array.. Matrix.. Web.. And plug the host in.. But it&#39;s cheaper to hire someone to do it, not practical....!?
I have it.. Not electric, hidralic, ar pressure arm, but magnetic like E. M. P.. with some surface plate to attract the hust and plug it in.. Cheap and muntional...!?
A machine can do it better and faster, I can imagine a robotic arm like the one on your videos to fill the car.. With 3 D camera, laser guidness, very FAST processor like A. I, WORKING GREAT.. but a potencial harm in the future
I like that parte when a machine can not connect the hose, and you need a human to do it, but it&#39;s a question of speed and programming, in time I think it can and will be done, your factories will reduce personal and add more robots...
He&#39;s lying. Lying king😅😅😅
Hi can you help me how can I get dingspore tesla plant
&quot;most people think i spend a lot of my time on twitter&quot; is so funny watching this in 2023
I love how obvious it is that this man does not have a clue about the tech and only knows about the business,
the first one minute of your video is not as interesting as the rest of the videos.
Him: I totally don&#39;t spend a lot of time on Twitter<br>Three years later: buys Twitter
he doesn&#39;t realise, your cars have a mental age of four, the cars are rubbish, and i don&#39;t think both of them realise that the batteries are made of lithium and cobalt which is destroying ecosystems and is mined by children
ELON MUSK IS A BALD PEDOPHILE
Side mirrors take off and make small screens inside on the doors with small cameras on the outside to project the image ?????
You should take down your Nazi, anti American posts. You associate with Nazi’s from South Africa, who would classify you as a sub-human, you are a Nazi puppet. And you don’t even know it. If you want to hang with famous people who are nazis, then wear your  Nazi arm ban.
He consider to new world
E.Musk had a strong work ethic🙋 &amp; the truth be told..he is very relaxed around black.people..his .S.African roots never left him🙈
I love he pays for them
Cutest
There taking about the model Y
I came from future Elon bought twitter
what is iterations please
You work for 40yrs to have $1M in your<br>retirement, meanwhile some people are putting just $10K in a meme coin from just few months ago and now they are multimillionaires.......
Jeez, it&#39;s so sad to see how Elon has drifted away during the covid times...he has become so much more absurd like Putin or Trump always was.
a tour would have been cool
JP Performance (German Car Channel) has just been hacked. And they are streaming this video and scamming BTC
Hallo and Greetings from the cobalt miners(kids) in Ghana who died,buried alive in the mines,breath toxic cobalt dust with there baby&#39;s on there back and get slaved for a emission free car, they are proud to be a part to save the world and they would be happy for your visit in Ghana, they offer you the best secure service you have ever seen and if you want you can shoot some of the workers cause there are hundreds of thousands there and you give other kids a chance to be part of this epic event.<br><br>Greetings also goes to Samsung apple and all the other cobald billionaires in this beautiful world you deserve every cent for your no live matters acting.<br><br>We dig holes too
Talking to a South African racist Nazi. He think of you as property not as a man.
been 3 years bro bought twitter 💀
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but and some point Marques, you need to decide what is morally acceptable on your channel.
Damn Elon really fell off
Resources. The new challenge on the horizon.
Isn&#39;t it amazing how a few years of r/conspiracy, 4chan, and just generally spending too much time on the internet can change a person??!
Elon Musk! 🙂 My goal is to own a Tesla one day.
lol thought this was new randomly appeared in my feed
Наложили другой перевод. Но звучит красиво, что хочется верить, что так и было 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=92">1:32</a>
It&#39;s interesting to see how different the Elon of 2018 appears to be to the Elon of late 2022. Guess you never really know someone&#39;s true personality until it hits you.
you are great elon
🤔
watching this at the tail end of 2022 is...interesting to say the least.
Elon Musk is actually shy around Marques instead of the other way around
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=90">1:30</a> <br><br>This is also why I bought twitter
It’s scary that this video is 4 years old.
Were you all right, Elon?
Elon musk is a terrible human
Wtf happened to him?
I bet, now you are not so happy bout this interview
boring
The collab’ we didn’t expect, but needed.
Being Successful it needs more responsibility then average mostly people they choose easy way and relaxing like me but i wish you the best life where ever you are, never lose hope
If you don&#39;t die a hero you live long enough to become the villain
why he looks so young
god this video and the comments aged like milk
2022. Dude buys Twitter. 2023. New twitter .
Interview <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/-fgfY9DIGYjbhgHLzoDIDw"></a>
&#39;&#39;Sometimes people say I spend a lot of time on twitter&#39;&#39;
Not the same Elon in 2023
I do love the commenters sucking Elon&#39;s dick non-stop, but at the same time it&#39;s kinda sad that the man is able to get away with the shit he pulls off and still have a mindless fanbase to enable him as some sort of a &quot;genius&quot;.
Just if old Elon knew what he has accomplished in 2022
Elon musk phone
We need an update with Elon!!!!!
4 years later he buys Twitter — absolute legend 😂
Repent and receive life from Christ and be saved
Noice chairs
sigan viendo.
Hello 😄😄😄😄😄😄
This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=95">1:35</a> aged very well🤣😂🤣😂😅
The interviewer, has more Ego, than Musk.
Currently watching this video in 2022 and realizing we were right. Elon spent most of his time on Twitter. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=95">1:35</a>
we are soon having a tesla megatron
뭔구독자가 이리많노
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=98">1:38</a> - “ I think sometimes people think I spend a lot of time on Twitter” - Now in 2022, owns Twitter. 😅👌🏽
Love you bro
Who knew that this man would take ok on Twitter?
Ask some useful questions man
I learn new things from Elon musk.with this video
Jesus christ HOW WAS THIS 4 YEARS AGO, fuck time moves fast
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=30">0:30</a> it interesting fast
I&#39;M NEW TO BTC AND I&#39;VE BEEN MAKING LOSSES TRYING<br>TO MAKE PROFIT MYSELF IN TRADING...I THOUGHT<br>TRADING ON DEMO ACCOUNT IS JUST LIKE TRADING THE REAL MARKET... CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT OR AT<br>LEAST ADVICE ME ON WHAT TO DO?
@Marques Brownlee Elon Musk didn’t finish college and owns Tesla!
Ugh! Why talk to this asshole? You should take this video down.
What an inspiration.. from both of you
Elon Musk is the person I want to succeed in visiting him to read a letter but he is the mango of my future
I hope Tesla cars all over the world
My Favorite Hero Elon Musk Sir 😍😘
elon before he went mask off and became unbearable …
Elon “I also pay full retail price for my own cars”?????? Now that must be one of the stupidest things said by anyone!!! And this from the richest person in the world. Well done old man….well done indeed.
Elon is look like iron man on his office
You tube,Google policies  the truth and does not allow it to air
He uses black child labour together his major car parts
You tube silence  the truth
Funky off , it&#39;s not your job to silence the truth you tube
What a massive hypocrite  you are , bigging up a man that gets its major parts from black child cheap illegal labour, you are a disgrace ,to promote him without  questioning  him. In today&#39;s climate what does  it feel like to have sold . You are a disgrace
What an elitest blowhard. He still hasn&#39;t come out with a vehicle that is affordable. His company has relied on government assistance and then practices anti-labor policies. No one buys your cars other than rich yuppies Elon.
Elon mars
elon inspires me do what i love
Bruh
Where there is will ,There is a way
b
Clearly, Marques did his homework. He kept Elon engaged.
solo estoy aquí por el video de Nate Gentile.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=98">1:38</a> LOL 2022 Acting Sus
Cool 🍺🍺🍻.
Elon Musk is the most productive ninja!
mark ass brownlee
oh boy, he was so high…
These motherfuckin ads
This dude is an idiot 😭 how do people still fall for this shit
His gesture showed us no time to lost for Creativity and Business.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=174">2:54</a> wow they just straight up copied a Porsche taycan, smh 🤦‍♂️.
I live in Fremont California I wish you come again
🇵🇬🇵🇬
He was young and we USED to trust him...
Elon muskkk and brownly yes a very Gud interview it’s amazing to see them talking abt how things work in the Tesla factory
This was a good and interesting video to watch and have a nice day everybody :)
Wow
Aquí los que vinieron por el vídeo de Nate Gentile
It’s funny how these two look alike stirring at each other.
I love elon
This guy could be the ironman
elon boa you should beware the kid next to you seems kinda sus 👴
this is the richest man in the world and with the amt of money he got in his bank his way to humble trust me cus dont be like this when they hit their first 100k
Lol 3 years from this interviewing,still waiting for that FSD and affordable electric car 😂
Elon has a tell.  You know he is lying when his lips are moving.
No robot will ever BEAT  Masha and bear.
Elon uses the word &quot;Prolly&quot;
Can&#39;t eaven listen to this guy, lack of social iq is crazy
one thing I noticed about the conversation mistake marques is making is losing eye contact intentionally and its a big flaw someone like you could have, so please work on that cause already showing lack of self-confidence.
I knew that this was the only interview that I need to see to hear where things are going thank you so much Marquis
Too bad Mr. Musk, I am an AI scientist that much have love on space craft. I made model airplane when in high school (1966) and college (1969), assisted to develop airplane auto-pilot for Sperry-Univac,    . I also have developed flying saucer that using AI and anti-gravitation technology that require less thrust that rocket. yet I have no fund to develop it. I am just poor scientist, who invent firm and software tech that for today uses ! (compression technology invention (had lawsuit to a stealer in san Diego) Navigation (had lawsuit again the thief in san Diego) ... If you read this message and want technology let discuss.. I am 76 year old I don&#39;t care money just for earth future only! ...I am Homer I Hope this message reach you to venture on my AI work, or if I die it will die with me!
mark ass brownie
Funny, watching this three years later. Tesla still has quite poor buildquality from anything coming from the American based factories. The model 3 costs about 2,5 times more than it did three years ago. There is still no roadster and FSD still isn&#39;t there.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=666">11:06</a> ...!!!
This guy perpetuates NASA lies. He is a fraudster. Says he like Edison more than Tesla. F*** Elon Musk
Who&#39;s here after the whole Twitter fiasco, lmao
Hey! Don’t forget that Jesus Christ loves you and he died for you have a blessed day❤️
bro this video is just about two dudes talkin shit
Elon got excited when he knew that everyone ordered tesla🙂
he literally talks 5 words and then he just *BREATHS IN HARDLY*, man elon, are you okay?
Elon even while talking shows how genuinely interested he is in ev&#39;s and how  wants to bring a change in the world..
nice background
Elon seems to love repeating words
Lucky you ! First time in an video I can see you very nervous, but job well done ✅
That&#39;s why elon musk is my and lots of people inspiration! ❤❤❤❤
nice one ...
Dome
i just remembered how handsome Marques is.
I WANT A TESLA 😩😩😩😩 ELON FRONT ME A TESLA I WANT TO MAKE MY BROTHER JELOUS
No computer chips I&#39;m willing to die
He is now the most richest person in the world and he wouldn&#39;t expect
&quot;Three years&quot; for a $25,000 Tesla, he says in 2018. LMFAO
Elon is down to mars &amp; thinks of new companies every second.(subscribe)
👏🤘
new suscriber bro!! greetings from Ecuador, keep it up
Hu
Elon kinda looks nervous
And hes bought twitter
W 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🇿🇦
Here come the retards of the left to attack Elon because he said he’s voting Republican.  Proves these idiots right, lol, the left is so far gone they can’t think straight.  Go fuck yourselves every lefty, I hope you all die horribly
🔥🔥🔥
Great❤️❤️🔥🔥
Hey Elon you&#39;re like a robot
He&#39;s a fascist (South African) don&#39;t be fooled!
not gonna watch the video but id say these two get on. Both have that same I hate socializing, can we all be robots vibe.
But he&#39;s racist...
he was making fun about people who spend their time at Twitter, now he&#39;s the owner of Twitter
it&#39;s looks like Elon showing his mecanisms in mincraft.
Ellon Stark
Elon is amazing!! He must have alien DNA.
Bhai g thode chote show me jana tha
this is the happiest I have seen Elon in an interview, because he is talking about about what he actually does and passionate about , I love that! we are lucky to have him in our generation , I dont know how many of us know !
he looks like he is used to being awkward
And here we see, 2 criminals talking to each other as if they are doing everything right and legal
Anybody else wondering how he met the richest man alive
This guy is the most rich man in the world and its amazing how accessible and chill he is.
chi? no chi te l&#39;ha chiesto?
Elon is so amazing, game changer
TESLA🍋
billy woods would be a perfect addition to this lol
Super rich people yet so down to earth and simple<br>Casual clothes no chains on.<br>You know when you&#39;re Big on the inside you don&#39;t need much showing to do.
Bro. You are talking with the RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD.
Hopefully we get another interview with him
He literally plays chess while speaking.
Do a 4 year update
Talk about awkward positions ehem thumbnl.. Ehem
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=94">1:34</a> thats why he bought twitter ;)
&quot;People think I spend a lot of time on Twitter&quot;. :)
i don&#39;t hate Elon but i don&#39;t trust or idolize him like most strangely do.
Amazing to watch this interview. Literally brilliant 💡 and things when designing his cars 🚗💓. Wow
Elon Musk must be one of few rich dudes who doesn&#39;t sound/get corrupted by wealth, he just sounds like guy who wants to do his fun stuff in life, whether it&#39;s making cars, going moon, or just travel around world.
20xx Inventor be like
I just thought of a solution to the side mirror problem. Replace the side mirror with small cameras built into the side of the car and put screens inside the car to view them.
That red sports car they showed near the start looked awesome, i would love to see a black version of that car.
One of the few people&#39;s who know almost everything about their products and can even explain them perfectly with real life examples. Amazing interview.
It’s refreshing to see the worlds richest man struggle with things a normal person struggles with. Stuttering
Watching this after Elon musk bought Twitter!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=94">1:34</a> i wonder why
Musk says Tesla does not spend money for branding because he himself is the brand!
Hi
“people think i spend a lot of time on twitter” 3 years later buys twitter
I feel like a life on the future
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=96">1:36</a> elon foreshadowing that he loves twitter so he gonna buy it
Who knows he will buy twitter one day
Little did he know he was gonna buy twitter himself
Busiest man alive? You DO realise that despise their wealth they don&#39;t work 14,000% harder than anyone else..? There&#39;s not 5 years in a day....
Very good interview. Well thought out questions and it was clear Elon appreciated it.
He’s a great successful business guy but not a good person, you can’t tell me otherwise
And the machine behind not making any horrible noise
so fake so full of crap. your clearly a satanist as well hey?
Wow
3 years later, no 25k dollar tesla yet
Wow u actually got to meet Elon Musk
Should of asked him how he regret his hair back
:)
Three years later and the guys still waiting for their cars
So you’re the guy from that Netflix movie sorry to bother you. With that white voice 🤣🤣🤣
President please
nice
Omg it is Elon musk
It’s honestly pretty wild that he still has his South African accent through all these years
If I got a cent for each Umm Elon said I&#39;d be the owner of tesla
<b>This guy just went from reviewing Samsung phones to Hanging with Billionaires~</b>
Elon Musk and Tom Cavanagh are siblings lol
Elon Musk is part of the Alt right and now owns twitter! Get ready for right wing conspiracies. smh
&quot;an electric car can be faster than a gasoline car&quot; LOL. It&#39;s as if speed matters, you cant speed anyway with speed limits keeping everyone to a minimum, so I don&#39;t really think having a faster car makes a difference...
Elon obviously carried the video, i wish Marques seemed more engaged and interested into Elon and his ideas.
He says umm and uhhh a lot
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=94">1:34</a> well that aged nicely
Elon gets a lot of crap but at least he is trying to do good in the world
This was such a solid interview. I would love for Marquis to have a followup 2020 interview.
if only he knew he was gonna buy twitter in 4 years
Great interview man you are with Elon musk
Iam excited I will go there boss Elon musk amazing please 👍 take care I miss you too honey GOD bless ❤️❤️❤️
He now owns Twitter so he will be spending a lot of his time on Twitter from now into the future, lol.
Great interview and great questions!<br>Keep it up!
&quot;I think some people think i spend a lot of time on twitter. I dont know why they would think that.&quot;:<br>4 years later buys twitter
this legend vid was uploaded on my birthday
A good grades 98% a
Who’s here after Elon musk trying to buy twitter
twitter???
Why not put cameras instead of side mirrors?
I don’t know why they would think that then buys twitter 3 days later
Elon is that guy ! Everyone needs to just leave Elon alone and let him do this thing ! Government could be an issue with the new Twitter acquisition
He seems like a good guy, I wonder what would happen if he owns Twitter 😆😂
This should not age well…
Brownlee is a legend.
be honest is that not elon musk and just the chinese guy but he learnt how to speak like elon musk
I would have asked him to Venmo me a mil
Tesla sucks.
Why u did interview with this ghetto idiot , musk?
I did dislike . Ilon mask is idiot , no more
Model 3 is $50,000
Brownlees hands are so big🙂
Isn’t that the guy who bought Twitter?
If                              I                                   had his money there will be no more animal abuse in the world and all  of the scum bags would have been  vanished.
We&#39;re in &#39;22 and I hope Tesla could now offer quality electric cars in about $25k like Elon said in the minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=306">5:06</a>.
This is the second time in a row i’ve read the title as “talking ben with elons musk”
Went from reviewing phones to chilling with the owner of twitter.
14 MILLION btw.
Did he say twitter 2022 he is the new owner of whole of twitter
Look at Musk&#39;s trial transcripts available on YouTube.  You will see just what kind of fraud he is.
What thé fuck why a piwerre was pirated by elon Musk😭😭
Talking tech with the CEO of twitter
“People think I spend all my time on twitter” lmao
I am here after elon mask buy twitter👌
and now this dude just bought twitter for 45bil for fun...
No clickbate 👍👊

RIP piwere
OK. You whiners out there. Take a lesson for this young reviewer who is everything you could be if your quit whining and get butts in gear.
Im happy he is Black!
Riding a benz is timeless
I appreciate Elon Musk almost never show ego.  After what he has accomplished.   That’s amazing.  🙌🙌🫡
Elon ❤💜💖💗💓💞😘

Tesla:<br>Model <b>S</b><br>Model <b>3</b><br>Model <b>X</b><br>Model <b>Y</b><br>There&#39;s no way this isn&#39;t deliberate. Elon is the greatest troll of all time.
i want one of his cars
Markass Brownie
Elon Musk is aware that word of mouth is the best form of advertising.  That&#39;s why he focuses on that instead of using other forms.  Very smart and cost saving...if you have a great product.
What does &quot;super generous&quot; mean? That doesn&#39;t make any sense.
Elon looks so energetic and well in 2018
Chất lượng, Sỹ Luân chắc thích bản Cover này lắm này! Chúc mừng em cùng toàn thể Ekip F. Studio
Thank you so much for this video. It is very informative. I might be too familiar, I am sorry, but i just wanted to say that Mr. Elon Musk is a very handsome man and very talented.
Tesla are to me, the new Apple. Ok I know this is a different type of company but they will just destroy many other competitors in terms of brand loyalty. They will have some crazy premiums on products and people will pay it because, it&#39;s Tesla.
I check how much Tesla stock was at when this video release and it was at $61 a share, now at +$1000 a share. Insane
Los wue den chupi tablisa oh que los amarren.
Es Eduardo mike
whats about fair paiment for workers at tesla... fuck elon
😊Elon Musk, legend of our time 🙏😁
This Elon guy seems like he has some money.
👏🏻🤔🤞🏼
Guys, I&#39;m from the future, and I can tell you for sure that he colonized Mars. Now he is The Great Elon Musk
Still waiting for the 25k version of Tesla after 4 years..
Who’s watching as Elon announced he plans to buyout twitter
I read: Talking Ben with Elon musk.
25K in 3 years was without Covid and related problems<br>Expect 2025
Didn&#39;t realise cars were that cheap in the US.<br><b>*Cries in danish*</b>
I am surprised why YouTube recommended this video after four years!
Bro I know Elon musk wants to save his money for space x and all of his companies so he doesn’t spend it on himself but bro why my guy is the richest person on earth and he lives in a 50,000 dollar house beside a factory just so he can stay beside his company lol but he is a legend he went from down low till one of the richest people on planet earth if not the richest
Imagine he didn’t press the record button all this while 🤯
Is there a solar powered Tesla car? Charging could be inconvenient and limited for some so it is better if it is a solar car. Is this possible?
People say he evil 😔Elon the only billionaire I respect
13 mini sucks , more importantly iphone customer care sucks .
I like that Elon is clearly even excited about his products and what he does. Gives me hope. And he’s my proof of my long time philosophy of you don’t have to hate what you do for a living.
Mrwhosetheboss have to do this too!!!
You did a great job with the interview
Elon got excited when he knew  everyone in the room ordered a Tesla,haha
WTH
Mate really went from tech reviews to chilling with the world&#39;s richest man.
The uh counter
Do you just have the numbers of the coolest people on your phone
youre so lucky!
Yeah chilling with a billionaire! 😎💸
So cool 😎 dude thanks 😊
elon would be a good president
Busiest man on earth? Seems like He spend half His day on Twitter.
Musk is Hybrid, Chinese+American. so his mind is not normal.
when elon mush said these are door carriers , i would had gone like &#39; what? like the ones in monsters inc?! `  then i would have been out that factory ;-]
how did u meet him?
Did elon forget about giga tx oh wait it was 2018
Richest man on the planet and very humble.
A the boss that
AGame 👍🏽
Most rarest things/people on earth:<br>1. Elon Musk<br>2. PS5<br>3. Strongest man alive<br>4. Pokemon shinies<br>5. Superheroes caught on camera
Hopefully someday Tesla figures out how to make budget cars: the Model 3 got pretty close, but still tens of thousands of dollars more expensive than your average (non plug-in) hybrid from Honda or Toyota. Because there&#39;s a question I don&#39;t hear asked enough: why do rich people care about gas mileage? lol. It&#39;s people barely making their rent that need those fuel cost savings. The aren&#39;t buying 40K or 100K dollar cars, not in this lifetime.
&quot;I&#39;m barely on Twitter&quot;<br><br><b>Joins Twitter&#39;s Board of Directors</b> <br><br>Lol...that aged like milk.
&quot;Busiest man alive&quot;? Cringe lol. Was that part of the requirement for the tour, that you butter him up? ;-)
Legends right here
His answer to the Roadster&#39;s battery question makes absolutely zero sense. He just rambles on and Marques isn&#39;t buying the BS. 5 years later and the Roadster is no where to be found. This guy is a con artist.
Now he will spend a lot of time on Twitter.
Seems as if he essentially passed down the cost of his failure in the cybertruck to us the consumers
Musk ain&#39;t happy make 100 billion a year.. he&#39;s gotta make 140 billion
Boy this video didn&#39;t age well, especially when musk talked about reducing the price by scaling up production.. same car that was 35k in this video is now $47k and unaffordable.. I have been saving since this video came out to buy one and I could&#39;ve bought today.. if it we&#39;re still $35k
This collab is amazing.
why does he move like a bot LMAO
elon musk is sooo akward lol
Man congratulations on this interview!! Hands down bro!!
Can you tell Elon Musk to make Teslas faster for delivery and making of it
3 years and there&#39;s still not a 25k Tesla <br>Wtf Elon
The excitement with which Elon explains concepts is super cool!
FUCK COROLLA CROSS ADS
Elon Musk is racist. Also I think hes a scam artist
How Elon Speaks Such A Fluent English
yes &quot;um&quot;
The most remarkable thing about this interview is that Margues made it happen. He got to sit down with Elon in the factory. That is very impressive.
It’s been 3 years 😐
He&#39;s a billion because he builds cheap and nasty built cars , yeh they&#39;re fast but that&#39;s it
why does elon sound more excited to talk to marques than marques is to talk to elon, marques is legit too cool for the  richest man in the  history of the world
God level man
Can&#39;t believe he wants to fight Russia...
Why does the thumbnail looks racist
It&#39;s Ellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllon
Thank you - it simply shows, why Mr. Musk is rightfully so the most valuable brains in the world today. Good mix and fair understanding of all the necessary concepts related to product development. Nothing, but respect. And to you, dear Marques!
Why does Elon say um so much for someone so smart
im from the future and gas prices are over $5 a gallon, this dude botta a $10,000,000,000,000 comapany
He looks so excited in this interview
Like the mentions with like the tour with the friends<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=533">8:53</a><br>OpenUP with SeTTings is the modular of what it is selling for.
It’s been 3 years
where&#39;s the car
I heard on a consumer report that tesla&#39;s have a low reliability score
only rich people can afford teslas. It&#39;s kind of like a rich man&#39;s car like a new Mercedes, Audi or bmw.
Bad ass
What a great interview, MB.  You did a great job asking really good questions, and got Elon to elaborate on the answers.  Top notch!
Elon musk and bill gates are the most dangerous people to humanity. they are so greedy that they invest to vanish humanity on earth
I love Elon
Come to think of it i dont think ive ever seen a tesla commercial. They don&#39;t even need to
I love how he&#39;s trying his best not to sound like a nerd.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=729">12:09</a> that went right over everyone&#39;s heads 😂😂😂 Elon literally says &quot;the only think beyond Ludicrous is Plaid&quot; 😂😂
I believe Elon is the most down to earth billionaire. U would NEVER see other people with his kind of &quot;status&quot; sit down with a regular person and just chat.
A Tesla motorcycle probably be cool
Can Tesla car can run smoothly in India ???
Listening to this in 2022 offers a few grimaces pertaining to launch dates
🤾🏽‍♀️🤾🏽‍♀️🤾🏽‍♀️😎
Wow this interview for some reasons feels so long. Its only 17 min but I stopped to see how much left and it’s still 4 min left.  I watch a lot of longer content so this length I usually watch on the fly …. So it’s a strange feeling for me.
nice
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=311">5:11</a> It’s been three years. Where’s my $25,000 car Elon?
Congrats on meeting Elon!
Now do an interview with Yi Long Musk
বাংলাদেশ থেকে বলছি আমাকে একটা কার দেওয়া হক 😂
from Bangladesh
Not the biggest Elon Fan lately (he wants to build one of his Giga-Factories here in Germany, and he does not give a shit about all the environmental regulations of the region) but I have to admire his fascination about the cars, his cars. <br>This is HIS brand, his heart and soul, and to hear him talking about it is so refreshing in contrast to all these CEOs of BMW, VW etc who are all in there to earn money first, and just memorize everything they would say in an interview like this.
LET UR WORKERS FORM A UNION
Great interview man even though I don’t rlly like Elon musk this was a really thoughtful and well done interview.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=82">1:22</a> 😂😂

So why did tesla use its own tesla plug in america 🇺🇸 and not allow other EV s to use his charging hubs.  Euro teslas where built right and have CCS .  Damage is already done reason everyone hates tesla. Euros and american EV drivers all hate teslas and will never buy one.  We would way rather have the Porsche EV that is quality and fast any day over a ugly tesla that looks like a wannabe mercedes fast but NO quality<br>The tesla roadster is the only one that looks good but you never see them only all the ugly ones.💩💩💩💩<br>So american teslas have a j1772 but no CCS ok that makes sense lol 😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Elon Musk,   What is  happening in currently until the end of the year during all of the worldly chaos of the stupid corona-19?   in 2022 in the Gigafactory?   a breakthrough, in a long problem unsolved, is it solved,  near sacremento or the Gigafactory?!
Hello I really enjoyed this one.<br>Please wanna learn algorithms for SpaceX codes and Tesla please could you please ask more tech related questions if you got another chance?
he is not a good listener he is just pretending... :p
can you do another of these but more about present tech like nurolink or however its spelled and stuff like that
I love Musk but if this is how he talks in meetings I dont know how they get anything done💀
Phones never became more affordable. Don&#39;t think cars would
It’s been 3 years and we still don’t have the $25,000 Tesla, let alone the truck or semi
The way Elon talks is like he&#39;s from the future and he&#39;s trying not to say something that might disrupt the space time continuum.
Trillionade
Camera: Shifts slightly out of focus.<br>Elon: Just like hey, guys! What should we focus on?<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=412">6:52</a>
Love from india !
Elon musk my favorite 😘😘😘
It&#39;s Pretty Cool To See This ! ! !🔥
Imagine talking to the richest person on earth<br>Edit: Could be richest on Mars too
it seems that guy is a GAMER..
Elon is a great person. The thing that shocked me was learning he got his money from PayPal sold with Co owner and got 200mil or so, decided to sell his house cars and live modestly. Put more than half his money in Tesla and SpaceX then had recessions and dumped everything in it over the years mostly 2008-2014 then had to borrow money from friends for bills at home and elsewhere. He stayed a very humble person and didn&#39;t want to be the flashy wasteful billionaire and instead lived within his means and focused all his money on things he felt was important for humanity as a whole.<br>He isn&#39;t perfect by no means but 99% of billionaires do not do anything remotely similar. They spend ungodly amounts of money while never really working. Elon is in meeting but also putting in 80 hour weeks with the engineers and workers and doesn&#39;t waste his money
Spesh shatal you s to you magnetic resonance im imaging to practical experience
stg out of all the &quot;big guy&quot; elon is probable the only who actually seems and acts like human
Why he look like Rick
in the thumbnail, they look like their holding hands
Hey can you do a video just like this about vertical farming. Will be cool to see you walk through those factories too!
it&#39;s 2022 so, are there 25 grand teslas now?
I know Elon as my king
Lol the comment about graphics card prices coming down didn’t age well
He said that the Roadster would have a faster 0-60 time than 1.9s on Joe Rogan.
so i didnt got this masterpiece recommended until 2022
Elon musk but on a few pounds lol
Elon Musk is amazing and so are his inventions!
God is coming back soon pls all repent..
I hate tech channels and their unskippable ads
HE IS THE RICHEST PERSON ON EARTH NOW

Dudeeee fuck off I wanna meet Elon lol
YouTube algorithm never disappoint us
europeens invented all
When will Tesla Motors enter India!!?
Funfact: Elon musk is saying ummm... In every sentences
Not meaning the controversy in 2020, he seems like a pretty nice guy!
Lol you know you&#39;ve made it when you&#39;re in the Honey ad that comes before your own video.
Elon Musk is not a boss, he&#39;s a Leader
Elon should visit waveform instead of JRE... it gets so awkward and forced at times. This needed to longer.
elon looks like he just woke up
I live near that Tesla factory, it&#39;s beautiful
Elon is a rock star...love him!
Elon Musk is the real life Tony stark and iron man
Next: Steve Jobs
Elon musk likes nodding his head frequently when he listening it&#39;s weird
Nice
while he&#39;s a cool guy i hate how people everyone treat him like some actually good billionaire, literally all are the same
Elon Musk such a great and hardworking personality
I mean lets not forget the fact he underpays his employees, uses child labour, and called his own child X Æ A-Xii
How in the world did he manage to get the world&#39;s richest man on his show‽‽
Watching this on 2021, waiting for an economic urban car (  never happend :(   )
Man I just LOVE!!! Musk baby!! 💪👌❣️😎👍👏🙂😉😀😃
Do I need to feel bad saying, that I have owned the Motorola 3200 and an Ericsson GH198 ??
Elon should find something substitute for the charging time to be faster like filling gas. That should b the priority other than making top end speed car or 2 cars launching together. <br>Or start to develop a easily removable battery wch can b exchanged to a fully charged in a fuel station like station wch is given as a franchise by Tesla and charge the customer a little lesser than gasoline
One can only imagine that compute-like processing that goes on in his head when he goes into those deep thinking stares
Hi richest guy in world i have 10 mill subs wona hang around (i said  10 cuz this was ages ago)
You asked some good questions I haven&#39;t heard others ask, well done man
Elon Musk actually sounds like a pretty chill guy
Marques seems to be a brilliant guy. This was a great talk with this genius named Elon Musk. Thanks Marques.
He makes limited run, high priced vehicles. GM does the same with Corvette.
Brilliance.
Does Tesla make car seats for kids? They should.
Watching this 3 years later, not down to $25,000 yet but getting closer.
damn, come to think of it ive never seen a tesla comercial
very cool marques
Next time ask him why he left poor south Africa to be an immigrant in America become the most wealthy man in history and refuse to pay his taxes to the nation and people that gave him his life and success. Otherwise back to poor south Africa. I&#39;m sure everyone there can afford tesla.
Still not affordable 😂
one of my favorite videos of yours is can you actually play in 8K
i love your videos.
hey marques brownlee
Tesla Family Car for India please 🥺
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=46">0:46</a>
It&#39;s already been 3 years?
and thats how model s plaid was born
Is it just me but every vid i see of Elon he stutters a lot. very smart man.
Next time on, talking with Elon musk: we’ve Built the Iron man suit
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=317">5:17</a> Brownlee pushed the machine by his elbow
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=475">7:55</a> elons hands are way too big because he is an alien
How to get meeting appointment with elon muskk.????
Elon is the only billionaire who doesn&#39;t make me cringe/angry when he speaks. Others should take notice.
Elon Musk is not the best when it comes to fluent speaking as you can feel that he thinks probably faster than he could talk. So it feels a bit disorganized at times.<br><br>But man..he’s one very rare smart guy, undoubtedly.
Your barain ...like...computer...you are always think...to next level😎👏😎😎😍 big fan bro love from mumbai...indian
Redo this interview!
woof. that was huge different than others
HI ELIEZER NITRO!!!
Busiest man? I don&#39;t think so. Try 80+ hour work week treating patients,<br><br>Ravi Peiris M.D.
You know Elon Musk its a tech genius becouse he beat boldness
The best interview with Elon  I have watched so far
Man I love this Elon musk. he always explains his complex idea with an easy sample.
This guy is amazing!
dislike
MKBHD’s cameraman and sound man own a Tesla!
He is a BLESSING to humankind!!!!
Open a category of Tesla EV racing for enthusiast and feedback the tech mods into production with rewards.
Hey marques please make a nother talking tech with Elon Musk video, thanks.
Wow
Elon Musk isn’t smart.
not to be rude or anything but any succesfully smart people that i&#39;ve seen talk like that.
Who is watching this video after elon musk Is the richest man in the world
A simple soul with 300 billion in pocket... Flag you had a chance to interview in more casual way... Congrats...
Ummmmm counter<br>100000
So sad RTX30... cards are even more expensive not  cheap
love this guy !!!! vary  smart , love all of elons work that u sir for taking us out of the stone age !!!! lol
Wheres that 25k car elon
japanese would help tesla better.. cuz japan are bad asss in automotive
Well yeah it&#39;s Elon Musk everything we say is trash....😁
THEY THINK HE SPENDS TIME ON TWITTER CAUZ OF THE FAMOUS MEME  &quot; elon r  u  ok ? &quot;
AWESOME ! The sky is the limit for you; and, of course, the sky has NO LIMIT !
Elon Musk wants to be on Mars not on Earth
It&#39;s officially three years 🔥
Love Tesla but when he talks about robots and humans when it comes to automation that is kind of why I have major doubts with AI. Not sure how the car can react to unexpected events and also choose to always make the right choice on the road. I think a human needs to make these decisions personally, there’s too many factors and risks.
Such a cool guy is elon musk
I hate Elon musk <br>But I love self driving car
This is probably the most intelligent, comfortable interview that I&#39;ve seen to date.
I&#39;m here after 3 years waiting for the cheaper electric car
Well wht happen to elon at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=600">10:00</a>
wow, this was 3 years and 3 moths ago, and i&#39;m seen this now
He was so nervous he barely made eye contact! But hey! this is the man who is beating Jeff Bezos in cash flow
I just wonder what goes through his head like he looks at a car and what does he see like all those parts and how they work together? Idk it’s just weird to think abt what he sees around him as a genius billionaire
Good to know we are still of some use for Elon Musk garden or garage issues (we can connect dangling hoses)... I&#39;m relieved!
is elon musk having anxiety
talk to your brown dhick
Elon was nervous
He is so Rich that he calls besos a peasant
Yo what the frick I remember when you had 90,000 subscribers now 15 million wtf!
He puts an anology of phones  where Marques can relate to.
Look how lucky he is. 🙏
You know he has 15 Million subscribers when he has a cool conversation with Elon Musk.
Now that man is the richest man on Earth
What an experience.
When Elon first tought of the $25000 model
1.29 Mr em is Elon mask🤣🤣
Marques,Make A 2021 Version Of This
Before I bought my first Tesla stock, my neighbour gave me a short lift in his Tesla Model S. I don&#39;t think he will buy another brand, ever, period.
wow!
If I&#39;m gonna abe the next billionaire I will go back in this comment section
Elon looks comfortable so cute
aint now way he just talked to the richest man in the world.
great man, can you put a question for crypto to him next time, tesla added shib as payment option. i kno this is weird but want to know what he thinks about payments in meme coins!!!
lol idk how you buy a tesla but imagine if u buy a tesla and it self drives to ur house LOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=880">14:40</a> I&#39;m curious to know what was the &#39;down arrow&#39; blinking at?
bro u ve really gone great
Richest man in the world carzy
Elon seems to stressed
me when whating this video thumbnail:nah its fake lets still see<br>me when sees elon musk : <br>😶😵😮
Watching it in 2021
Its meeeeeeeeee
give me one please.... wkwkwkww
Best investment for 2022: RAN on the ASX!!!
Can we all agree that when He uploads our days get better! 💖
I wish i heard a lot of what he said
OH MY GOD
How does this guy get to talk to Elon? lmao what has he achieved in life besides having a youtube channel?
Nice interview Marques...it&#39;s great to see someone let the guest speak and speak freely without interruption. Nice work!
how no one noticed both of them wearing their own merchandise ............
Elon Musk is from Africa, Its like he doesn&#39;t care about his country. Instead, of inventing things and selling&#39;s things in U.S he should probably make his country develop and start a business in Africa. I know his business is in Africa, but the price of the too costly in Africa rather than in U.S
This man looks tired as hell
Elon seemed so into this interview, like he actually enjoyed it unlike many others that he’s been in where they just ask him stupid questions about politics and money just so he would slip up and say something that will get people to try to cancel him.
He reminds me of Sheldon Cooper 😂
He was planning about cybertruck already while talking to Marques.
I never seen this video. But today first of all I recommended this video. What the hell going on😹
Each time Elon takes a breath=new tesla
lmao why have i never seen this.
how great is marques giving an interview to a fan
when you talk to a man you look at him in the eyes lol good talk !
Collab with jeff Bezos please ❤️❤️🙏🙏
Super excited sir  love you
16 oct 2021...<br>YT algr ...<br>Yeesh
Very good
This is sick
Decided to revisit this after watching some recent Musk interviews (conducted by journalist ) and it’s a night and day difference. Elon’s elation is clear. He’s talking to someone who loves the product and is asking him about it. Unlike other CEOs, Musk would much rather talk about and work on improving the product than quarterly earnings &amp; projections. I love it.
Sir Marq is an awesome guy who can vibes with that billionaire aura. 👍😍💕💖💗❤️😍👍
Sir Elon Musk must be the father of the modern era of tech. 👍😍💗💖💕😍👍
This interview is from 2018, now the world is changing and also your decisión making towards helping humanity with your genius scientific knowledege and Heart  base decision making. You are a light Warrior.
While talking his brain is planning a city on mars
I don&#39;t understand anything he says. I think it&#39;s because of elon&#39;s accent
3 years where is it
Lol
Elon musk❤ talk with you🥲<br>You&#39;re very lucky....<br>We are so unlucky😔
Don&#39;t let me down Elon, I just purchased a new Tesla in July, I will receive it by the end of Oct 2021.
Will u get on the spaceship?
interesting to go back and hear elon talking about the roadster...when the model S Plaid is not an idea yet.   to date the Plaid has blown away everyone at the dragstrip and the nurburgring..for a production sedan.  i suspect the roadster has been completely deprioritized.
His brain is more fast than his mouth.
That Elon guy speaks strangely ☹
There years later and still 35,000 more 😂
🔥
Elon definitely has a stuttering problem. I do too. Makes me feel better 😅
Badass Background…Ever in any other Interview.
Elon talks way too fast. I suppose that&#39;s to match his thinking speed. I think too fast myself but I can&#39;t talk as fast and hence talk for longer and they say I talk too much. Lol
elon&#39;s marketing strategy: memes
I was watching people milking Cows in the bathroom n drinking it, mixed with water from the taps,Baking cake/ salads/barbecue in the bathroom..bro its a whole house, barbecue in the backyard, cow on a farm, grow roses in the front yard, cook in the kitchen,brush teeth in the bathroom  duh? It was horrorful to watch.. i aint eating that ever😰
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=215">3:35</a> tesla is a brand doesn&#39;t need advertising 👍🔥
Mkbhd is good my motivational he only one person to meet for all world famous person just likes Elon Musk and sundar piccahei and more I proud of sir keep doing good job
Tesla education collage, that could be cool.
omg he was right he say in 3 year a 25000 dollar Tesla will come out and now after 3 years one is about to come out
👁️👄👁️
This man is amazing. He talks with literally every famous maan and woman.
if the earth is 93.697 miles far away from the sun and rotating around it while rotation every 24 hours around it self why does polaris and sigma octantis stars never move ? the EARTH IS FLAT !
appreciate showing the captions from Rich and Brandon. Mr. Brownlee. It&#39;s hard to hear audio coming from background.
Damn. No talk on the cyber truck?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=1031">17:11</a>- Me trying to whistle for the first time
Excited Elon musk is a little bit like a kid that came back from playing on the playground with his friends and he is so excited that he doesn&#39;t even know what to say first but I just love the energy
How can you just not sympathize with elon after watching this video i know he is a bit of a awful speaker but idc about that its probably because its complicated what he&#39;s talking about 👍 really good guy
He stutters so much, his brain is working so fast.
The hushed november pivotally lock because ruth aetiologically slip under a  fixed goal. tiny, acoustic brass
You should&#39;ve laughed more 😂
He is real life of Tony stark
OMG YES ELON MUSK PRONOUNCES NEVADA CORRECTLY LOL. HAHAHA
This guy seems cool, he should start a rocket company
Elon Musk is operating on a different level!
ഏതേലും മലയാളീസ്🤩🤩
He is cautious not to tell about the Tesla bot
This guy on left have alot of knowledge, He should start his own company .
i want to help elon whit cars desing
sad hero worship
Yeah that&#39;s some journalistic integrity there, let&#39;s pause so the entire crew can regale you with the products they are buying from you. :\
The dependent porter prospectively sail because seagull premenstrually trade regarding a useless soda. stingy, good snowplow
u should have asked him &quot;In the future will the battery&#39;s be recyclable.&quot;
Why has model 3 never been sold on its great 0-60 capabilities? I only learned with the advent of the tesla trucks that electric engines have more power than combustion engines.
i&#39;m watching this again  (8/19/2021) after AI Day, next factory tour with Tesla Bot
Ome of my favorites video in this channel
He looks so happy getting interviewed with someone who respects his culture
When red cameras meets Tony stark
Just came today and found that the video turned 3 years old <b>exactly</b> today :)
cool
I hope i  the future tesla expand to bikes and make a Kaneda inspired tesla bike lol
Elon’s voice is so soothing to me lol
Did I heard more than usual American accent from Elon Musk?
Tesla ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Talking tesla with elon musk * CORRECTION
thank you for this video.
Elon is the kind of guy that has a lot of great ideas but but but h- he he is ju- just just not that uh a a good at explaining the the stuff in his his his uh mind
Step 1: Find a product that people love… then make a slightly better version of it, and price it WAY BELOW your cost so that you lose money on every unit sold.<br><br>Step 2: Create a ridiculous mission statement. It doesn’t matter what you’re selling -- your real mission is things like consciousness, happiness, and community. And use the word ‘technology’ a lot. No matter what you’re producing, always pretend that you’re a tech company.<br><br>Step 3: Raise money from investors at an obscene valuation on the basis that you’re a visionary tech company. Don’t bother forecasting profits and creating conservative pro-forma statements, from which investors can derive a sensible valuation of your business. Instead, let the investors imagine how profitable your company can eventually become.<br><br>Step 4: At a minimum, double your losses every year. And, as you continue to burn through investor capital, raise even more money at progressively higher valuations.<br><br>Step 5: At the peak of the stock market bubble, take your company public at twice your last valuation. Reward these gullible investors with limited voting rights, and consolidate your power over the company as you steer it towards greater and greater losses while showering yourself with gigantic compensation packages.<br><br>Congratulations. You’re now a billionaire.
Elon Musk is very humble, kind, intelligent andddddd he pauses alot before he say something.. hes clearly a cyborg.
This interview was 3 years ago today! <br>Time flies
Going to interview one of the richest men in the world, i think i&#39;ll wear grey sweatpants. 💁
can you ask him how he got his hair back ?
Whats up my technigga
😧
real life tony stark :p
The hapless toe tribally heat because giant particularly offer aboard a abounding sycamore. nappy, tan breath
Elon cocain 100%
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=488">8:08</a> is really funny
Quite hard to listen to him, i can see the host has some difficulties following Elon&#39;s words, probably  because he&#39;s a little socially awkward ,that asperger&#39;s syndrome that he has is at fault, but he&#39;s a great man!
2 Legends. WOW 😍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=233">3:53</a> more affordable cars.<br><br>If I understood correctly, If the demand is high, companies will grow, and that income will drive the prices down.<br>or, If competition is high, the prices will drop.<br><br>It feels bad man.<br><br>The up price should be relative to down demand, always. am I wrong?<br><br>If the people operated as a company, and wont buy stuff that are the wrong price considering the whole company, ...<br><br>Maybe I am saying, I cannot sell to individuals, if there are a million people demanding your product.
this interview made me subscribe...niceeeee
The abiding bass concordingly burn because hexagon holly unlock until a infamous aftermath. thankful, ugly america
why does elon look like malcolm merlin from the arrow

Aug 4, 2021
watching this now no need to say the date and time i guess youtube
Gotta say, I love nerds
The utter shelf presently invite because parade focally dust except a wandering bear. annoying, phobic fold
higher volume? we need less people in cars and more people in busses, trams, trains.
Truly crazy how relatable and friendly Elon is! Try getting an interview with Jeff bezos lol. He will charge $1M for it
I couod never hate elon musk. I think he has a great down to earth attitude. I think tesla know exactly how to make a car.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=880">14:40</a> &quot;humans&quot; are really good at adaptation... 👽
If I was paid 1 dollar for Elon to say &#39;a&#39; I would be more richer than him 😂
liked that Musk was very much honest about the shortcomings of his current Tesla products as compared to  the conventional cars.. not just touting or false praising about his products like any clever marketeer...
I swear the smartest people find it harder to explain things because their brain is running so many ideas and knowledge at the same time.. people who speak smart usually are just trying to cover up their lack of intelligence with big words…
he says ´like´in every sentence he say &lt;3
So Elon can talk without a million uhm and uhh
Why is Marques always so awkward in his videos
Elon musk is my favourite, I’ll interview him for my channel
Elon wanted to geek out about track mode and Marques made sure to no let Elon side track 😝🤣🤣 literally
Imagine Elon already has a neurolink and that&#39;s why he&#39;s a genius in our eyes and has time to do all these things at once. When he talks about AI he describes himself. 😝
So much better because questions are open ended and allows Elon to actually share his overall thoughts instead of being interrupted or cut short.
Elon Musk didn&#39;t workout or what?? Lol
The super door transmurally pinch because sofa energetically guide times a eight hovercraft. gigantic, crazy bean
I expect the 25k Tesla next year
Man it’s hard to believe you went from doing videos at 100 subs to 14 million amazing can’t wait to see you hit 20 next
Elon is literally real life Harrison Wells. He even kinda looks like him to.
I love how he is saying every 10th word hes thinking to try and get to the point effectively and not be boring. He&#39;s so weird. Such an awesome dude. From what the media shows anyway. Who knows who, uhm, what? he really is? Maybe he&#39;s just trying to go home, with the entire SpaceX thing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=580">9:40</a> Bhai Bhai 😂😂
The gray greasy great debtor oceanographically bubble because temple anatomically deliver beyond a tall mustard. selfish, historical gauge

Honestly Elon is not good at interviews, he uses a lot of umm eh well well, sorta fillers in between, compared to marquess who is more accustomed to this
He should build a rocket company:😂😂
Nice
This is how many Elon musk said, Um<br>👇
Who is here after madhan gowri&#39;s video.. ❤️ 🤩 🥳
i&#39;m sorry but he does not sound like an entrepreneur or a business man. find him sus. wonder if he really is one or did they just put him out there because he&#39;s a good actor
elon telsa
cant imagine the richest man on earth is shy dont have direct eye contact <b>hes one of the genius dudes</b>
Fans who know how to criticize are true journalists
It’s cool to me Bc he’s like being super nerdy and it’s processes well in his mind but it’s hard for me him to put into words for common folk ( lowkey a nerd here)
A man created a car years ago that ran on water he went missing because a car which runs on water isn&#39;t effiecent for the people who run the world <br>But a car on electricity in other words is perfect because the government can still charge you for electricity <br>They can still run the world controling peoples needs <br>I can see this playing out where global warming will become a big thing and people can not drive cars run on petrol or diesel because its ruining the world it then beckmesva bkg crises and bill gates gets involved with musk to save the world and everyfhing is electric from money to cars ti phones
Too stuck to your questions agenda Marques. Show more emotion and react more emotionally to the answers of your host; that will be be way better.
This is better then the Joe Rogan podcast. That one sounded like a 3am conversation!
🙏🙏🙏👍👍👌👌
💯
Youtube recommendation is 2 year&#39;s late 🤐
Great Job
Ok
👋👋🥇
Marques is just great interviewing his fans lol 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=501">8:21</a> there was something on the camera
Great interview Marques is doing a really great job
When he said that they spend no money on advertisement, I realised that I never saw a Tesla ad and they still have a huge popularity because the buyers are doing the advertisement.
Just improve eye contact man , rest of it a great job interviewing the geniuos
i just watched a debunked elon musk video then this. and imo. Elon is actually a smart guy. no doubt about that.
Elon Musk is fucking awkward in interviews lol
Great interview
Didn&#39;t know Elon is a PC gamer
i always pass by this factory in fremont i think it’s sick how elon musk is there on a regular basis
Little did he know he’s talking to the future richest man in the world
We need another interview please!!
Elon musk +mkbhd 🔥
Wow soo cool you met Elon. Awesome 👌💥👏💥
Can you put a word with Elon and say that Vladimir Kllapi wants a Tesla Model X
I have a 2005 jaguar xtype...can I trade one if I&#39;m Lucky 🔥
three years later looking at this video the plaid modes are already achieved. The cars  cold start move from 0 to 60mph in 1.99 secs..
Really Elon then why does the price of Tesla&#39;s keep rising?
2018: Elon musk was an ordinary businessman and a tech person.<br>2020/2021: RICHEST MAN ALIVE
Why does Elon Musk look like deepfake
Ya know, after Elon came out on SNL and said he had Asperger&#39;s, it definitely gets more noticeable. Super happy he gets to do what he loves everyday
The bored day ironically dare because kick arespectively injure towards a bright robert. ragged, magenta match
His brain works so fast that his toungue couldn&#39;t catch up to it
Eron muks
Elon musk is the coolest guy
Fun fact: asking elon for a million dollars is like asking that weird guy from the back alley for some weed
Great interview!
Tesla needs a more traditional looking pickup truck with 4wd
idk
Anyone else think Elon Musk sounds like Jeff Goldblum?..... No, just me? Ok 😂
wow
Need a TESLA BIKE!! C&#39;mon Elon
ELON MUSK ROCKZZZZ
Looks like you will have to make other arrangements for living as Elon has asked for lot of money to be on this channel.
man he looks so tired he need to sleep a few extra hours more
everytime elon musk stutters his brain creates a new set of command to speak and predicts the response to it
He seems like a nice guy
Superb guy.
This Elon guy seems cool he should launch a Tesla into space
Elon Musk should create a video game console
I love this dude,asking right question at the right time : )
2018.. when my role model was Elon musk
The automatic downtown accordingly approve because vacation intraperitonally change past a difficult society. motionless, yellow jam
Only if Marques knew what he was in for
Elon is obviously a fan, maybe even a bit star stuck himself.  When is the next interview?  So much more to talk about now.  Great content MB
Whoaaa this was uploaded on my birthday
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=190">3:10</a> yeah I took a model 3 for a test drive. loved it absolutely. I had to tell people about it.
Very2 interesting talk with world most influence guy..👍
The attractive glove aditionally milk because muscle intraorally post next a willing stew. last, tangy purchase
Elon needs to stop messing with the market
Elon Musk is the perfect example of the future, bitcoin investment is really a profitable business to invest in.
Marques is so nice he visits fans like Elon.
Me hearing Elon say the other car companies are much bigger and then realizing it was filmed 2 years ago Watching this when Tesla is the most valuable car company in the whole world with over a $700 billion Market Cap.
Thank you YouTube for bringing this video forth once again,see MKBHD talking about the future 2020 little did they know it&#39;s going to be a one hell of a year , Thank God we are getting over it little by little
The energetic clipper startlingly crash because drum taxonomically alert failing a phobic governor. parallel, overjoyed duck
My first question to elon would&#39;ve been how to pronounce X Æ A-12
This guy somehow makes the complicated stuff sound so easy to understand
The petite copyright externally lick because december orally curl about a dizzy ex-wife. gabby, sordid cover
Good conversation between white man and black man.
he said in 3 years a 25k electric car, i&#39;m still waiting....
The rebel east unequivocally warn because dedication relatedly fade circa a well-off blood. impossible, massive cooking
How have I missed this?!!!<br>Fantastic!!!  Marques, your editing is stellar.
I love my Tacoma
This is a perfect example that you don’t have to be good at talking and using words to be successful
Waiting for elon&#39;s idea to hit India
Awesome Chat!
Interesting Video!!;<br>People will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in bitcoin
Elon claims Bitcoin is a polluter. What a hypocrite. The mining for the lithium for his batteries and his rocket program are very big polluters. This person does not even have solar panels on the roofs of his factories. Electric cars are the second biggest polluters after after gasoline cars. Elon is in no position to judge others.
The lost twin brothers of muselk😂😂
The best man in tech industry right now 😄
we are so lucky that elon musk is able to handle stress and bullshit so well. he is literally the worlds only hope in terms of thinking outside the box. people need to support this man in every way possible. it still surprises me how many people try to roadblock elon and his advancements. but like i say he has all the patients in the world. when you look up the word goated there should be a pic of elon.
The fancy diving conventionally gaze because peripheral dimensionally flower given a thoughtless flavor. tangible, abashed eyelash
His face lit up so much when he mentioned track mode 😂<br><br>Shows he has more than just a smart brain
The unusual screen laparoscopically suspect because breath physiologically wish aboard a entertaining mist. versed, colossal linen
He said 3 years. He was right.
😁😊
I really feel like I could need some help right now.
I come back just because I enjoy this interview as well as how far they have come.👍🏾
Amazing 🙌🏿
The elfin theater bilaterally skip because tax aetiologically call beyond a resolute phone. peaceful, imminent museum
The literate sugar analogically choke because feeling presently bounce qua a glib sleet. fat faulty, daily basin
Your riches, worth and success is defined by how you treat others.
Marquees, Unbox Therapy and a few others are undoubtedly becoming some of the influencers most tech companies revere and fear.
You asked him great questions compared to other people. I wish the interview was longer but I’m sure he was pressed for time. Great content either way 👍🏻!
The brief galley subcellularly relax because flat locally doubt per a brown cucumber. innate, smooth index
The thumbnail is a lie... I thought it was relationship goals with eye contact, hand holding and &quot;that look&quot; S.Os give each other
Marq: Buy 2020 will the roadster achieve 0.61 sec with 200W battery??<br><br>We did achieve the 0.61 sec, but not with the Tesla Roadster but with the cases..., 🦠 🙄
This is 2021, the video was in 2018. Cmon Elon where’s the Roadster? Put on the back burner?
there&#39;s been two ages of the automobile in history. FORD when he kicked off the automobile revolution in the early 19th century. TESLA (Elon Musk) is the second age. moving from fossil fuels and into the electric car evolution. what a legacy.
Great questions! Fun interview :)
Marques has a hard time keeping a eye contact with him.
10th gen honda accord owner here, im considering getting a tesla lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=315">5:15</a> and he really did it after three years
The plausible helmet delightfully pump because whip analogously suspend modulo a tiny lightning. reminiscent, reflective cannon
Elon Musk saying uh for the 69 time
Elon is an unique pesrsonlity in the tech world
Nice video❤️ very engaging from the beginning to the end. People will be kicking themselves regrets in a few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in Bitcoin<br>It&#39;s a pity that most people out there struggling through intense hardship and have ignored Bitcoin, were as Bitcoin can uplift there financial status
Mr. Brownlee has a problem with eye-contact, lol
Elon: We will launch a new car<br>Marques: I have been using that for weeks
The hanging veil disconcertingly dream because sandwich intracellularly drag past a vulgar spring. pleasant, scared helmet
Idk. Elon seems like a nice person. But… I can’t tell whether its just marketing tactics and like a ruse?
Is Elon a fan of this guy or is this guy a fan of Elon, I&#39;m confused🤔
@kaguutk so he is making a car company and space company and what i think is he is making a smart home company. (ELON MAKE A SMART HOME COMPANY It whould be cool with high tech home systems) idk why i made this comment it whould just be super cool. A cool name whould be Eome Electricity With Home baam Eome.
Who did know Elon musk will be multi billionaire
✨✨
I can just see him in a wario costume saying &quot;waahhh&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=315">5:15</a> Elon Musk told maybe 3 years, does it mean this year august?
YouTube: Yeah I&#39;ll put this in peoples recommended now.
Elon is the coolest dude on the planet
such a humble man Elon is, I mean just look at his dress so simple
What&#39;s up for lunch? <br>Elon: Tesla
Honestly if i meet Elon i would talk more about Neuro Link &amp; SpaceX....Elon is more than just cars
elon power
It&#39;s great time talking with elon musk. Its a good conversation.

The  fixed sunshine computationally arrange because fear rhetorically possess against a thinkable jennifer. interesting, gullible gusty hydrant
Elon musk is Energetic and positive <br>Thinking person
Dude, great interview!! Loved it! But how did you not talk about the future of autonomous driving?? That’s one of the most exciting visions I think Elon brings to the world.
its like a 2 robot talking in robotic feild
The Tesla factory look amazing
Anyone here after Sundar Pichai&#39;s interview?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=385">6:25</a> That LG slider KG800 chocolate was still with me until a month ago. 😱
The obese blizzard cranially jail because kenneth quantitatively tremble underneath a brawny passbook. icy, sedate sudan
Comedy of errors, (probably should not say that, immediately) tragedy of errors!! :D :D
that chair looks hella uncomfortable..
❤️❤️❤️
This message goes to anyone who wants to be successful like Elon Musk or MKBHD. God stands by your side jus maintain the hardwork.
This earth is haunted, then why would someone unlike such a beautiful video, omg I wanna grab their necks. That&#39;s why they won&#39;t be successful like these men.
Talking Tech with Elon Musk!
how did you  get contact of elon musk
ha cool
Thank you, Elon!!
I really did not expect Elon to be that tall
Did anyone notice Elon secretly yawning at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=76">1:16</a>? :D
Elon Musk It is a legend
This guy blinks once in a blue moon..
We’re basically a bunch of nerds in here….. Is that what he said at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=524">8:44</a>?  If so, it also applies to us watching this video LOL!
I think I have an iq of a gold fish listening to Elon musk talk
You&#39;re definitely a super genius because you discuss elon with 20 minutes...
The cut cry covalently return because cougar centrally cross between a mysterious pound. overt, dreary psychology
The only thing I noticed was when the camera zoomed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MevKTPN4ozw&amp;t=762">12:42</a> there&#39;s a small orangish spot that pops up and stays up for along time
More like talking sht
🤓
Whose here after Elon rekt the markets? 😂
It&#39;s time to have a new one now ... Talking Crypto with Musk!!!
Not trying to get so technical. But i think as a reviewer you should try to keep looking into your guests eyes. Most of the time he was looking away and i think it may make the guest feel uncomfortable.
It&#39;s been 3 years now, where is my affordable Tesla.
What an idiot
The succinct forehead ordinarily recognise because venezuela contradictorily sail below a fabulous arithmetic. short, teeny house
Anyone else hear the fire alarm in the beginning? At the factory.
What about if you’re 4 10” can I reach the pedals? LOL
Immediately when he said doors for the things moving behind him I’m like ummm monsters Inc. much
Sus
He said in 3 years a $25k car, is it 3 years yet?
When fellow humans could sit down together and talk face to face! - without wearing 😷
hello Elon if you want heat dont use nukes cos that will contaminate mars use giant thermite bombs instead you get massive amounts of heat with no fallout and what did they used to use to melt ice in the antartic in the 1960s thermite !!!
He a lumpy boi
The animated motorboat intialy alert because accelerator logistically wait off a important kendo. pale, foregoing breakfast
6 &#39;1&quot;  and a half
I love that Marques is wearing a vive shirt lol
We need a longer interview next time bro, like hour plus! Good stuff
Is that an htc t-shirt?
toyota over tsla all dam day
Elon just woke up haha
Doge to the moon!!!!!
Great Interview
Keep the Subject on Right side...
you could see from the way he talks that his brain is processing too much information to say lol
Worst Turing Test ever. Pretty sure they are both robots. Best case scenario is they are two robots trying to pass as lizard people, so no one tries to fuck with them!
It&#39;s weird. Watching this in 2021, I feel like this video is soooo outdated, just because so much has happend to everything regarding Tesla
too da moon
I love how you wear the HTC shirt instead of a TESLA shirt haha
If you really want to be SUCCESSFUL make as many MISTAKES as possible.
It&#39;s amazing how he speaks the flaws, limitations and cons without any concern, or choosing the words on how politics do.
&#39;Humans are good at adaptation &amp; rapid evolution and doing finicky things&#39;  Elon Musk
What about a RE-Talking Tech with Elon Musk!?
He looked more nervous than Marques 😂
How many people think that elon had also seen this video
He does ads imao.....pr, he himself is a walking ad
Who&#39;s here after him revealing he has Aspereger
For a second I thought Elon was about to hire Marques right then and there and he’s not even interviewing for a job lol
He&#39;s more of put the idea into action than put it into words!
Am I the only one who is wondering how does he spend time with his kids ?
PART 2 but discussing the video you just posted
We need The Boss to speak to Elon too!
I am here after alon musk tweeted about dogecoin
this was in 2018??? where has time gone?
MKBHD doesn&#39;t seem that friendly with people!
Elon musk is definitely not a good orator :)
Did he mentioned dogecoin
This guy is so cool. But his brain goes way faster then his mouth
It bothers me that he’s stuttering a lotttt
Im also South African
Why does it look like Marques is the guest and Elon is the interviewer? 🤣🤣🤣
His brain is so powerful that his mouth can’t keep up with his giant brain. That’s probably why he stutters
Did any even think that the tesla factor looks like the inside of a star wars star destroyer its just my unpopular opinion but Elon could be dark Vader..
guys...please let me know dat what was happening in background ...plz tell
The amount of “uh uh uh umm uh like like” i heard 😹
