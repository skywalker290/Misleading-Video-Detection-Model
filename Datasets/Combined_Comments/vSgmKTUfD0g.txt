Watch my review of Dolly Kitty aur Woh Chamkte Sitare: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21zsgxLY3Qk">https://youtu.be/21zsgxLY3Qk</a>
I stopped watching Dolly when someone jerked off to a Mr.India song. despite being a feminist I hated Lipstick as well. Tired of such woke+ full of politically correct ideas being thopoed at you films that make you feel bhaad mein gaya believable storytelling?

Thanks you guys!
For a movie that deals with some pretty harsh issues, it is surprisingly and heartbreakingly tender. Some people have commented on the number of issues that this film is trying to tackle. To me, they felt like a part of the whole - different strands that go towards creating a social fabric that is so suffocating. Beautifully written, directed and enacted!
When you understand these whore mentality

Ye bhoomi har movie mein same acting karti hai😠
Netflix, upload complete  song
Idk why but I feel that Netflix is the only platform who brought changes and challenges in movies, and giving chance to other strugglers, by which viewers are getting aware of different real talents from different areas...
Ha ha ha Rasode me kon tha <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH9_231nIaQ">https://youtu.be/vH9_231nIaQ</a>

Watch my video one time ..😜 i feel you love my video😘
Telugu dubbed please
Okay so either Vikrant is engaged or married or about to marry another woman!<br><br>2 behen ki journey me freedom aisi hai- Konkana gets free from her husband bcz sexual satisfaction nhi milta plus he&#39;s a pervert. Bhoomi gets free from her jiju, her parents and a liar boyfriend.<br>Both were betrayed, both gets freedom in the end💁‍♂️<br>Quite Predictable huh!? I&#39;d be more than happy if the film gets an entirely different storyline and climax than this cliched climax
Vikrant Massey is everywhere 💯😁
Bhumi❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🙏

It&#39;s sad that Netflix is loosing it&#39;s standards these days by promoting more of violence, sex, fake feminism etc as content. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the right way to promote women empowerment by showcasing only female sexuality as a method of liberation. I saw the trailer of the film and it&#39;s sad that films like lipstick under my burkha, veere di wedding, and now dolly kitty and chamakte sitare are loosing their main theme under the garb of unnecessary sexual projection and promotion of infidelity in relationships and marriage. We as women aren&#39;t just about unsatisfied objects of physical desires. We have careers, ambitions, dreams and physical and mental well-being. Yes sex is a necessity and we do have desires but our lives aren&#39;t just revolved around partners that mistreat us, ignore us, abuse us or do not satisfy our physical and emotional needs. A women centric film is supposed to cater to all these dimensions of a woman&#39;s life. But sadly makers are simply directed towards cheap feminism, drugs, alcoholism and unnecessary sexual content. To be equal with men doesn&#39;t mean equating with them in terms of loose moral character, criminal mindset, lethal addictions and bad behaviour. Men and women are never equal, and we are perfect in our own ways. And our equality should find its place in career, political and economic opportunities rather than socially degrading actions. I hope Netflix comes up with some real women centric content like Gunjan Saxena, Mary Kom, etc (without starkids ofcourse 🙄).
Is that bablu bhaiya🔥😂😂

Vikrant Massey is the new Radhike Apte for Netflix.
Let&#39;s see what the movie is like once it is released, she did good in movies like bala and underrated film saandh ki aankh.
When you are so early that you see no one is blessing your parents😀
