Jai Jaganath🙏 🙏
To beat Australia in semifinals/final   strategy should be only attack.
Australian😆🤏

Aus par pressure banane ka hai toh aise hi khelna hoga final ya semi final jab bhi aap aus se khele tabhi match jeet sakte hain
Only England and West Indies has the capacity to smash Australia
Australia won 2023 world cup
This match is a prime example of needing more reviews. Roy&#39;s decision was very poor. I&#39;ve always thought Kumar just guesses
You are already winner if you beat australia in knockouts
2027 WC india will take revenge from Australia
England deserved to win the WC2019

Who is after Australia vs India 2023 final
Some shitty Indians will come here and comment that how happy are they to see Australia lost that Semi Final match against England. This shows that how much mean mentality Indians have and we just think to win the World Cup trophy 😂😂😂😂😂. This is extremely hilarious 🤣😂. Indians are always Indians with mean mentality and that’s why they lost both world cups in 2019 and 2023. 😂😂😂😂
England left Jason Roy in WC 2023 and they bite the dust😮
Really missed jason roy in this world cup.<br><br>I am missing that demolishing England team as well.<br><br>Come on England. Win both the wt20 2024 and champions trophy as well.

Ye match dekh kar eng par proud hota hai
I wish if India defeated AUS like this😢
Verry good to seen sad faces australians
England 💥💥
Australia ko haarta dekh acha laga...
Watching Australia&#39;s defeat is another level of satisfaction. They should be f*cked in every single WC from 2027.
Jabse aus ne ind ko cwc 2023 haraya ye mujse bardash nahi hora ha isliye ye semi final ki highlights dekh raha hu isme England ne kya mast pela hai aus ko

Dang warner just need 2 more runs to get most runs the pain bro
Gg
Why these Team have rivalry?
It was special perfomance from England. Their classy bazball at its best. If theirs someone England missed the most this wc it is Jofra Archer and Jason Roy. <br><br>Never saw such a dominating perfomance against Australia in a semi final.. Jason Roy&#39;s blitzkrieg ended any little ray of hope left for Australia.
Everyone thought that Australia England would be a very interesting match and it will go down to the last over but it turned out that the semi final 1 which was played by India against New Zealand turned out to be one of the most Epic matches of World Cup history rather than the Aus vs Eng one...and everyone predicted Ind vs Eng and Ind vs Aus game as finals and there came Kiwis to shock all the people
Jason Roy is such a stylish batter when he gets going just don&#39;t know why he wasn&#39;t included in eng side for 2023 WC atleast when topley got injured they should have included Roy and bairstow was utter flop show didn&#39;t score in a single game in 9 matches he played pothetic
Smith deserved hundred here as well...2 hundreds in 2 back to back semis what an unbelievable record that wouldve been
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=50">0:50</a> what a stylish short man 🥳
When Aus goes down smith ready to fight for Aus in knockout game&#39;s

Who ever wins semifinal against Australia will win World Cup 2011 India 2019 england
Smith always performs on big stages . he gave his best where no other batsman could not score
joe root is truly a gem in world cup. in 2016 t20 world cup he was tin top 3 in terms of runs and in 2019 he was in top 5.

Iss baar world cup me India ke saath Yahi huwa, 2019 me aus batting and bowling accha thi aur semifinal me eng ne dono taraf doya r 2022 me India ka batting and bowling accha thi r semifinal me eng ne doya r dono baar eng champion bana
Who came here after Eng won T2P wc 2022 ❤️👑
Alex carey plays crcuial roles but underrated ...
For england woakes and stokes doing job <br>But <br>For me Rashid and Archer are champion ND done the job and send them into final
I love chris woakes 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️❤️
This is One of my Sadest day,

Aus team ka players league phase  mein koyi aur the SM koyi aur
Miss you so much eion morgan 😢
England win world cup 2019
Itna gatiya umpiring
After 1992. Nasser Hussain enjoyed it 😅
Archers played a handful of games and is careers is already over. damaged goods he&#39;s not got the body for cricket.😉 he should of played for is home country West Indies. END OF🤕
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=172">2:52</a> we talk about the Kohli and Babar Elegance. When Jason Roy gets going, he plays such great cricketing shots. What an amazing player to watch!
Fully fixed to to win england 1st wc trophy
Roy is my favorite ♥️
unforgettable match ever
No matter what Smith never fails to perform in important matches
Roys only impressive innings in this carrier
Jason roy treaten stive smith and i treate bowlers in wcc2 game

Roy hits the ball on roof 🤯
There is no other happiness in this world than to watch australia loosing
This semi final was fixed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=249">4:09</a> watch Jason Roy reaction 🥰🥰
Changed openers Australia!
England the fake world champions NZ robbed most hollow victory ever in the history of ICC tournaments NZ knock England out of the T20 world cup netball world cup and 7s rugby world cup hahaha revenge
Well played both teams
Why do I feel like every one has watched all of the cwc 2019 matches at least 2 or more times? This wasn&#39;t the way this game was going to pan out in my head when I heard england were playing australia. I thought it was going to be very close, or australia was going to win. As a england supporter, I was very happy at this outcome. But australia played SO differently than this in the group stage leading them up to this. They even beat england pretty badly in the group stage. Smith should have tried to accumulate runs and play out until the end, and the hit out so he could get them to around 250 or so. But when Jason Roy gets started, there is no stopping him. No hate to any teams, reply if you disagree.
I was at this game, absolutely incredible. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen England beat Australia in such a one sided fashion before this game.
JASON ROY My Best Of The Best Player 😎🥰😘
Archer and Roy you buty 🥰🥰😘😘
Woakes and Archer were lit😶‍🌫️
Roy and Woakes sends England to finals <br>Ben Stokes and Buttler makes England win the ICC Wc
Steve Smith was playing just like he had played in 2015wc against India in semifinal. If he had got good support than they would have thrashed England just like India but good bowling from England
Maxwell and Carey should have done better after getting a good start big matches makes big players 👍
I still believe Josh Hazelwood could have done better that behrendroff I know behrendroff did well against eng earlier but Josh is different and zampa in place of lyon 🔥
That was Morgan we knew....
Why Australia didn&#39;t change the openers. If Head, McDermott or Phillipe plays they are better than Finch.
Real batting starts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=172">2:52</a>
I had to watch this a few times during the last Ashes series!! Just to remember when we were able to beat Australia!!
This semifinal was not exciting as first semifinal. England had won the match single handedly.
BRUTAL hitting approach by England!
2011,2015, 2019 all 3 wc&#39;s won by home countries
Pleasure to watch from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=230">3:50</a>
Maxwell thinks he’s a power hitter but he’s just a kid in comparison with roy butler hales bairstow stokes and Livingstone
Nowadays England takes Australia like kenya zimbabwe 😂<br><br><br>Love England team from India 🇮🇳
&quot;Morgan takes his team to world cup final&quot; - 2019<br>&quot;Morgan announces retirement from international cricket&quot; - 2022<br>Time changes soon 🙃
Most weirdest world cup where a team won the cup by even after a draw match, with those stupid rules.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=338">5:38</a>
England played superb.
Jason Roy: That&#39;s how you hit the cricket ball
Aus vs eng
typical finch affair! get out without scoring in knockout matches
Smith runout like dhoni 😭
Is this guy the only referee in cricket?
so why are you shocked it can happen i think your brain is in half half of you brain is cutted and it has also happened in ipl india hosted the ipl and all of those ipl indian teams won and in psl all of the pakistani teams hosted and all of the psl pakistani teams won and also in BBL
My fav moment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=244">4:04</a>
Roy reminded Smith.... why he dropped his career as a bowler..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=110">1:50</a> gotta feel for the lone warrior Smith
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=173">2:53</a> What a classy shot that was.

They have Jos butter, Sanju Samson and devedut padikal and the interesting factor is that all of these three are in form and scored centuries in the last season they also have James Neesham and Daryl Mitchell and also Rassie Van Der dussen they will make it only worry is management.)<br>PBKS/(will let you know) after an edit by till then!!!

🌺Devi Padmavathi🌺(Goddess of snakes)  is my father. Yes it is true. I have born by her blessing.  For example I am like Karna ( in the &quot;Mahabhartha&quot;) who was born by the blessing of Lord Surya. If you want any proof please come at Guma Manasa Bare ( very famous temple of my father) in West Bengal and ask here. Here my father comes every Sunday. I not only want that people knows my truth but also I want that everybody knows my father&#39;s power and nobility. Belief or unbelief is your matter. Don&#39;t write nor think any hate speech about my father and serve her. My father blesses you. Thank  you so much..🌹🍒🌹💖🌹

The umpire was dreadful during the entire world cup
Smith 49❤
2019wc winner -ENGLAND
That moment Jason Roy hit it out the ground was utter perfection! What you didn&#39;t see on the highlights, that you saw on the TV, is the faces of the poor little Bruce&#39;s looking up as it when over their heads and the looks on their faces was an utter joy to watch haha!!! If you want 20 seconds of how important it is for any English team to get one over on the Aussies, that hit is it! Perfection 👌 <br><br>Sorry Bruce! Better luck in 2023
Roy forgot it&#39;s a odi
Australia best
The same plastic you throw on the ground can go too the sea and be eaten by the same fish that’s been served on your plate,stop poisoning yourself and your loved ones ~use a thrash can❤️❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=244">04:04</a> when Jason Roy hited 6 was awesome
Yyyw

England is my favorite team🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Who is here after Australia won another World Cup?
England is my angry 😡😡😡😡😡 <br>Wood is ගොනෙක්
Two runouts in this wcup turned out tobe turning point one dhonis runout and other steve smiths run out.
Jason&#39;s clapping at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=300">5:00</a> is hilarious he looks like a school kid who got punished for no reason
5 time champion
I play wcc2
Australia didn&#39;t only win 5 world cups but also each World Cup they win in different continents . <br>1987 - Asia<br>1999 - Europe<br>2003 - Africa<br>2007 - America<br>2015 - Oceania (Australia) 👍
wistindies vs paskitan
Australia played like we don&#39;t want this we have 5 in almarah.
jeson roy, Not out..🤣 😎
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=310">5:10</a> bgm name?

Alex Carey is a gem to this Australian squad
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=301">5:01</a> me when my competitor wins
Both marginal runouts broke their chances for finals.... talkin about dhoni&#39;s and smith&#39;s😪
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=277">4:37</a> kumar dharmasena worst umpire 👎
😍😍😍 england england 😍😍😍
T20 world cup in icc bring it in icc channel
England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤
Woakes and Roy send England to final<br>Other team-mates- <b>Why are we still here to suffer</b>
Well done England for beating Australia
supper
Jason Roy treated Steven Smith like l theat bowlers in wcc2 game 😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂
England did the same thing to Australia what australia did to India in WC SF 2015
Woakes op
Bro england ne ek bar world Cup जीता hai or austrailia ne 5 times जीता hai
Same run mai out
Unfortunately Smit and Roy 2 great player same run out
<b>This Kind Of Batting in WC Knockout, Take a bow England!</b>
Woakes treated the Australian batsmen like I treat the batsmen in Wcc2
Feeling sad for usman khawaja not get place in middle order
OP
Who wants to watch this match with me
Jason Roy was on hurry to finish the match 😉😉😉
Yuvraj Singh :🔥🔥🔥 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_41paeArOX0">https://youtu.be/_41paeArOX0</a>
Go England!
, 😇😇😇😘😇😇😘😘😘😘😘😘
2 legends became run out in semifinals, 😔
Both the semis had a brilliant run out at crucial times
Anyone noticed, Root missed his half century by 1 run ?
easy mode
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=281">04:41</a> saying no but raising the finger 😑😑
Even tho I am a diehard England fan but I really feel that getting Steve Smith out is not a business England excels in
Australia really need some batsman(and bowlers?) bro these ppl won&#39;t do anymore, other than warner, smith and maxwell, they need good batsman now...they give up the moment they allow steve smith to bowl in such low score condition.
It&#39;s a good reavenge from England 🇬🇧
What a player Jason Roy is amazing
Dhoni run out and India loose Smith run out Australia loose
Did anyone notice or heard iPhone meme song in the background
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=109">1:49</a> that ohh tells us about that ball from archer
what a brilliant match it was
What about buttler&quot;s throw
The mistake of Aron Finch is he elected to bat first on pitch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=94">1:34</a><br><br>Rashid : aahh? <br>Umpire :<br>Rashid : aaaaah? <br>Umpire :<br>Rashid : aaaaaaaaaaaaah? <br>Umpire : ok (given) <br>😂😂
Look at Jason Roy reaction <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=301">5:01</a>.
Slow start from Australia
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=301">5:01</a> thats me during my school assembly

Best 👍
India 🇮🇳 is the best
Morgan was really greedy taking the winning runs and root was on 49 and England needed 2 runs
The day my heart broke again 💔
Pity root didn&#39;t got his fifty/half-century
Chris wokes 💪💪💪😍😍😍
and our indians (except jduu and mahi) surrendered to kiwis
And thus Australia missed her sixth world cup title....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=280">4:40</a>
Chris woakes is a superstar.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=246">4:06</a>

Wokes nice performance
Roy and Bairstow deadly combination
Alex Carey  added valuable runs to Australia and gives affect on scorecard and which cannot be handled by opponent
Any RC20 fans here?
What&#39;s the beauty from Archer and Jason roy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=243">4:03</a> That&#39;s enormous
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=244">4:04</a> Michael Slater 😂😂
👍🏻
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=83">1:23</a> tough shot
I can&#39;t believe it that Australia loss semi final 😤😤😤😤
I love that shot when roy was twisting his hands to hit six, still i like that moment
Broooooooooooooooooo the Jason Roy flick
Amusing 🙂🙂😊🔥
Cummins and Carey should not have appealed for jason  Roy it was not good
Australia&#39;s team selection was all wrong for this match. Playing Glenn Maxwell in place of Usman Khawaja was a blunder. It left them with a weak batting line up. With Alex Carrey batting at number 5 it exposed their batting badly. <br><br>Also why play Marcus Stoinis as an all rounder when his bowling is of little use against a strong England batting line up? Why not play a proper batsman to strengthen the batting?
Roy ended Smith&#39;s bowling career in an over.
ICC needs to learn editing ❤️
I was very happy that Australia didn&#39;t win it. I am very happy for England.
Kumar dharmasena wrong decision Jason roy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=183">3:03</a> what a shot!
My. Favrate player. Is  the j barstow but  jason roy best. Oppner
Fixed match
Jason roy punish aussies for five times winning world cup 😎😂😂
This WC was filled with runouts, painful for the losing teams : SF1 : Smith, SF2 : Dhoni, Final : Guptill. These runouts were agony for India, NZ &amp; Australia
Imagine if we won World Cup
Root hit a boundary t
That empire who gaves Roy out, Played Major role In England winner of WC2019......
Jason Roy and Jhonny Bairstow are the best openers after Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan 🤟🤟
Title woakes and Roy send england to final <br>Rashid be like: am I a joke to you
When smith come Boling starc be like - to Mai kya karu job chod du 😅😅😅
I watched this match LIVE .. England played brilliantly.. Jason Roy played fearless cricket. So smoothly , like he didn&#39;t hesitate even a little in hitting those drives and shots .. they made the match completely one sided towards the end, what a great match it was!
I support newz
Jason roy and Smith 85 runs
Australia should have played Usman Khawaja instead of peter Handscomb
Admit it or not jason roy ഒരു മുഴുവട്ടൻ ആണ് 👀🔥
Jason Roy and Steve smith same score
Jason roy desrv 100
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=249">4:09</a> roy showed the look on the australians faces

Smith and knockout have a same blood❣️
AUS WTF AND ENG WELL PLAYED IN THE FINALS TOO
Steve Smith Is Alone Warrior In Aus Line-up 😭
When I saw it was a highlights of 5 min I thought it is not a full highlights but 😂🤭
Smith,morgan,Williamson are far better captain than kholi. They always play powerful knock in decider match. Kholi is overrated and overconfident 😡😡
Oz crickters are a disgrace period .
cris woaks treated glen mexwell like i treat
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=300">5:00</a> wat ws that

Smith&#39;s run out in semifinal 2 and Dhoni s run out in semi final one was heart breaking
Australia play very well but England win
should have been India and Australia but bad luck
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=244">4:04</a> didn’t understand the commentary
Bairstow looks so cute
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=57">0:57</a>
I don&#39;t understand how australia team select the team
Let&#39;s talk about Jason Roy 3 balls 3 sixes in Smith over
Bechara Steve Smith got hit for 3 sixes by roy
Stoinis is a very Overrated player in Australia....he should be replaced soon
Expensive Steve smith😂 after that ball tampering
England
England deserves karti hai world cup champion ke liye
Though I don&#39;t watch that much Cricket, nowadays I am watching as I am at home, so I am watching the highlights of World Cup matches.<br>England played very well, Love you England from New Zealand!
Happy birthday smith
One like for sumit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=144">2:24</a> One of the most underrated throws in cricket history.
Jason treating smith like kids<br>Smith to roy:came in ashes
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Smith run out aus lose semi final. Dhoni run out India lose semi final
Smith and Dhoni both are my fav of all time
<b>Joe Root My Favorite Batsman Please Joe Root Ko Sport Karo</b>
Oh that flick shot from roy what a beauty❤️....love him so much😎
I think Australia dont want to win more world cups they have sufficient. 5world cup in their name.
What a irony British vs British??🤐
Jason Roy is underrated player
england 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 superb country.
I treat bowlers to every ball boundary in wcc2.. just like Jason Roy treats Steve Smith with hat trik sixes..
The Fact is that<br>In &quot;semi Final&quot; -1 INDIA 5-3 wickets<br>In &quot;semi final&quot; -2 AUSTRALIA 14-3<br>☝☝☝🤔🤔🤔🤔<br>What the CWC19 playoffs was Fix<br>🤔🤔
Opening batsmen and opening bowlers of eng were the reason behind the success . Roy was in his peak form of his life .
Both the Semis had crucial runouts at crucial times.<br>Coincidentally both Dhoni and Smith completed fifties in 72 balls.
https://youtu.be/YXhLH8HuDRg<br>AB De villiers 10 best sixes
What a run out from Buttler <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=142">2:22</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEg0bh0H96A">https://youtu.be/kEg0bh0H96A</a>
F Australia! I love England! Yayyy!!! Was a great world cup indeed!😍😍😍
Marys ha, Avludhan,
Two throws made difference of from Buttler and 2 from Guptill
Superb ball for Warner
its cheated because the super over was also tied
Joe root is the best part time off-spinner among smith,Williamson,kholi.
Smith is good
Unexpectedly England Won the Match
But still Australia is better than England after defeating them in bilateral series by 2-1 in their homeground
Roy is my favorite player
Aaron finch wicket is a game changing wicket
Archer woakes wood rashid deadly bowler
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2dq3b6REg8">https://youtu.be/q2dq3b6REg8</a>
in ind vs zea semi final dhoni run out<br>eng vs aus semi final steve smith out almost with same strike wow!
Smith always performs under pressure
Honestly we always says Virat is best but in pressurised situations he never plays good innings...like Steve smith, kane Williamson and joe Root plays...
All people only talk about Williamson see how calm always Morgan is .
1st SF: well Playing Dhoni Runout<br>India lose<br>2nd SF:well Playing Smith Runout<br>Australia lose<br><br>Final: well Playing Guptil Runout on last ball of super over<br>Rest is history
Jason roy very handsome cricketer
Jason Roy  treated Steve Smith the same way as I treat the bowlers of WCC2😂😂😂<br>Lol😂😂😂
I liked the bashing of Starc.
Me in wcc2 666646 Roy in in world 66666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666.......

Mostly Roy played like 400+ yarget

Very relatable
Jason roy srh
Eoin Morgan 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
man nobody noticed the pace of mitch starc , 150 and 149 KM
I like Kohli more than Smith but Smith is by far better performer in big stages than Kohli
&quot;England has incredible grounds for World Cup matches&quot;
Steve Smith best player  and vell play England  and Jason roy
england are selected world champion like selected PM imran khan
Zampa should in place of lyon, marnus labuchagne should in place of handscomb
Australia shouldn&#39;t have bowled to Roy when they heard the music at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=249">4:09</a><br><br>SHOT ON IPHONE 🤣🤣
Yellow yellow dirty fellow🤣🤣
I thought during this match 2inning Australia will do bowling than Australia will be in final but i was wrong England has defeated very easily and entered in finale worldcup
result are in the title of this vid
England should not have won because australia is better
This is what Australia used to do with other teams in the knockouts of early 2000s tournaments
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=236">3:56</a> power of bubble gum 😂
England show their class on the Semifinal 😇
Actually Roy and Bairstow send England to worldcup
Jason Roy absolutely destroyed Australia
India doesn&#39;t won because of the loss of ambati Rayburn as didn&#39;t got no 4 batsman
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=243">4:03</a>- why wasn&#39;t this six considered in the biggest sixes of world cup 2019. It has gone 101 meters.
Steve simth and MS dhoni both were run out on the semis 😢😢
Best innings for Roy
Roy the fearless batsman.
So no one is going to talk about Steve smith and how great he was?
I don&#39;t know but when it&#39;s edgbaston ground always England won lol
Is nathon lyon a commentator, seriously?
Very Very sorry
Who is here after India defeated England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 in ODI...?? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fact:- The target for Eng was same to the Run made by indian team in 2nd semifinal.
Sorry aus I go for you

😰😰😰
Cheating
You beat Australia in Knockouts you deserve to be the champion
Downfall of Aussies Started from this Match
Australia won the toss &amp; chose to....... 😆😆🤣🤣😄
Sky blue Jersey is the lucky Jersey for England, 1992 , 2019 in same Jersey
Srh fans assemble🔥❤️
eng played like oz and oz played like eng
Australia ki middle order mein batting bahaut weak hai,ek time tha jab Andrew Symonds jaise khilaadi middle order mein aakay dhaamaaka krtay thay,Maxwell bharosemand nhi
India icc ke tournament ke knock out matches mein acha perform nhi kr rhi hai 2011ke baad se
New Zealand is champions actually
If australia in final...they are champions
feeling bad for smith he is really a hero love from india
Steven SMITH the lone warrior
Roy is such a good batsman
Rohit warner were briliant
I like joe root.<br>Because of following reasons:<br>1. His simile<br>2. His captaincy in test<br>3. His drives.  i.e. cover drives <br>4. His batting.
It so ironic England whom kept Zimbabwe out of test cricket for so many years adopted Graeme Hick Zimbabwe brightest batting star
England and Australia had never care a puppy tail about the progress game in the associate countries all they care about who can won the Ashes . South Africa should have been praise for allowing Zimbawe for playing in her four - day domestic which helped Zimbabwe emerged as test playing countries. England had never allowed Scotland , Netherland or Ireland to play in their first class four - day domestic league yet they allow them in their one day league knowing one day game hardly improve in a player . What England do is to use talented players from some of these countries to bolster their test team. Australia had never allow neighbouring Pau New Guinea to play in their domestic four - day league that this countries can get the experience to come into test cricket.
England and Australia for years treated test cricket like their own personal toy telling whom come out to play . For many years these two white nation pretented Zimbabwe from playing test cricket . One ask if the ICC body is a fuzzy organization ? How could they allow England and Australia to have such monopoly
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=7">0:07</a> golden duck for finch
:nice:
worst umpire
Never underestimate Jason Roy he can any time play a destructive inning
Austrlia not much good now like earliet
Both semifinals had a crucial run out of dhoni and smith and also had two crucial lbw as well of both losing captains kohli and finch
Whatever happened in the final.... That does not take away from the fact that this England team deserved the success as much as new zealand did...... Very well balanced squad
Good performance roy
England J&#39;s combination players are lethal <br>Jason, Jonny, Jos, Joe ,Jofra,
One of the most one sided matches I&#39;ve seen in recent times. Aussies were clueless how to bat and ball while England played perfectly 10/10
Luck plays a massive part in sport
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=281">4:41</a> dharmsena pays off of roy&#39;s wicket for meaning less wicket in final
so it was all run outs that changed the course of the game.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=152">2:32</a><br>Smith&#39;s runout was similar to that of Dhoni&#39;s runout
2011 : <b>India hosted WC, India won WC</b><br>2015 : <b>Australia hosted WC, Australia  won WC</b><br>2019 : <b>England hosted WC, England won WC</b>
Why did dharamasena did that  at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=282">4:42</a> 🤣🤣
What was that dance by jason roy about?
All knows by unfairly England won the world cup .
Highlights of this match is SwaG off Jason Roy😂😂
🕕👍
Roy do a Large 6
k, lol
Finchi comes Finchi goes! The RCB effect!

Brilliant ❣️ performance
Australia ka dominance ab khatam ho chuka hai 2019 World Cup loose <br>Ashes tie 2019 after wc<br>Ind aus Series 2020 lose
Archer the man too (Maxwell and Finch)
Is no one going to talk about Smith’s 85?
I love Chris woaksh bowling action ❤️❤️❤️
What about Adil rashed
Outstanding
Finch and Warner both destructively batted the whole world cup season but in the important time they both got out
Really England deserves this World Cup. :3
0;22 super catch
Icc:Woakes and Roy send england to final.<br>Adil Rashid:Am I joke to you?
🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏
Woakes is the most underrated England player ❤
There is run outs in both semi finals and they are heart breaking.
All best batsman were runout during semi finals.  Steve Smith.  Ms Dhoni.  Ross Taylor.  Etc
I think England is best team
Buttler agrassive run-out is the best.🔥
J Roy my favourite batsman

Jason Roy reminds me of Sehwag.... No fear😍

Eoin Morgan was at the receiving end back in 2015 but what he&#39;s done to this side is commendable
England openers after 2015 World Cup right from Eng vs Nz series in May 2015 have completely changed their ODI batting way<br>These players are just wow 🔥
Cheerio cheerio 🔥🔥😂😂😂
My favourite moment was Steve Smith was bowling
I like this match
Root should have made his 50
Ben stokes great cricketer for all time❣️❣️❣️
Australia could have played better
What a comeback for England australia 3 wickets down only 13 score and Australia batting and bowling lose and England win this match
Smith 👌
Smith Was More important in this Semifinal than Dhoni Was in the other..<br>But Still Indian Fans Cry On Dhoni&#39;s Runout..<br>Thats The Spirit Of Game.<br>Those Who win Shall Not Cry all time on Loss.
Please Take a minute to watch my short clip..<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XDhnGLpAa8">https://youtu.be/3XDhnGLpAa8</a><br>When you can&#39;t memorize that you can&#39;t memorize

I mean Australia played very loosely
Final chances : <br>England Vs India<br>England Vs New Zealand<br>India Vs England<br>India Vs Australia<br>Australia Vs India<br>Australia Vs New Zealand
India knockout because England is not a place for World Cup because weather is not good in such a situation even team will better performs but bad weather stopped the game But Ind 🆚 Nz game rain not happened weather will good then I think India wents up to the final.....
I can&#39;t stop laugh at 4.40 😂😂
when stokes was bowling u can see that smith had a struggle bec hes small<br>bec stokes is bigger than him thats why
I really enjoyed this match COZ Australia always shows attitude that we never lose match In semi finals and this time also we are d champions again.but England performance shows right direction to Australia.
Smith is a big match player he proved it again
I want in 2021 ipl anyone knock out Mumbai Indians like this
Australia murdabaad

India should learn from England that how to not choke while chasing totals in the knockouts of the icc tournament.

England took revenge of lose vs Aus in league stage.

The different thing India and England that India lose semi final is that India is very pressured in semi finals and England are fearless that why they win world cup

England
If you ever feel depressed, then think about david warner! He was just 2 runs behind rohit sharma for wc 2019 leading run scorer!!!
My favorite is jose butler
I&#39;m an Indian but always supported England. Am glad they have won the cup. I couldn&#39;t believe that they invented cricket and it&#39;s the first world cup they&#39;ve ever won
Morgan the man who brought revolution in the England cricket, huge respect.
Jason roy-the lion.
I have never seen Aussies playing this worse!
<a href="https://youtu.be/a2ij4xb3Or4.">https://youtu.be/a2ij4xb3Or4.</a>. MUST watch - - Pakistan vs England 2001 natwest series thriller match at Lords in HQ
Jason roy 0 in 2nd over vs pat cumins. But wrong umpiring. Aaron Finch given out on 0. See in final also against trent boult Jason roy on 0 in 1st over but wrong umpiring and he scored 85 and 27 in semifinals and finals. See the match changing moment. Ross Taylor was not out in final. Other wrong umpiring. Martin Guptill throw to Ben stokes other wrong umpiring. Jason roy was out on 25 also against India on hardik pandaya ball but wrong umpiring. Aus vs eng 3rd test 4th inning wrong umpiring 4-6 times against Australia.  Especially when jack leach was out when 2runs needed and Nathan lyon was bowling. Pak vs eng 2nd t20 Eoin Morgan was 0 out against shadab khan but wrong umpiring umpire call what against arron finch in semifinals. England is luckiest team in cricket😭. That&#39;s why they won. Otherwise they don&#39;t deserve anything. Sl vs eng match and world Cup changing moment. When Joe root was out after lasith malinga taken DRS. 🇦🇺 is unluckiest team in cricket still they are successful as compared to other team. England luckiest team that&#39;s why nowadays they look strong. Other wise they are weak. They can loose series against Ireland also 2020. But wrong umpiring. West Indies vs eng 1st test 2020. 6 wrong umpiring desicion against west Indies.
I believe its adil rashid who should be in title lol. Got break through when partnership was building
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=118">1:58</a> Smith seems disappointed 😩

Steve Smith😍, when team is in struggle...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=281">4:41</a> what is is saying and why?
Actually I&#39;m a bangladeshi. But i always love england fans and england players. England is always my second country
This is fixed match because Elizabeth gives money for loose and australia has lost it and If you can see Smith is playing Slow and Warner <br>Have need to play Pull Shot and Why Finch not take the Out chance So that&#39;s why Australia bowlers throw  slow balls this is the reason
I love to play for ENGLAND CRICKET
England is a poor
AND THATS UP HERE IN THE COMMENTARY BOX

i think that due overconfidence India lost the game against NZ......and only the first 3 players had overconfidence  and over smartness..that NZ is a very weak team and we can easily win the match

Australia vs england semi final.2 england win 😁😁😀😃😍😍😀😁

Why u all are running after Steve Smith ,he does good only in tests ,but he is not a match winner only he can pile up runs for his team ,but he can&#39;t finish match when his team is under pressure ,there are other players also who are doing hardwork ,u have to also see other players
Stokes takes all the plaudits for winning the World Cup. However, without the blistering form of Jason Roy, we wouldn&#39;t have even made it out of the group. Player of the tournament for me.
I think that batting order wasn&#39;t right Handscomb is not a good choice at that position... Steve Smith should&#39;ve been sent at No 3 and Stoinis at no 4 because Smith rotates strike and Stoinis can play Fast bowlers well ...in the middle Alex Carey and Maxwell can play spin well and are a good finishers..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=244">4:04</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=247">4:07</a> who knows what the commentator was saying
Eng worth it
Smith is always one man  army.
Who thinks Australia win before macth start like here
1 minute silence for those who thought pakistan would win this world cup🤣🤣
Tamil
Can someone tell me what “gaurd middle stump” means?
Jason Roy cover drives were mind blowing and his.innings is one of the best innings of world cups.<br>Love from.Pakistan
England bowling snd england to the final
🐽
foundation for England&#39;s most of the victory is the  Roy -Bairstow  partnership
England murdered Australia here.
When  australia gets  out of world cup it feels satisfying.😌
WC2011 : Host &amp; Winner - India<br>WC2015 : Host &amp; Winner - Australia<br>WC2019 : Host &amp;.Winner - England
I think after pakistan ausrtalia is also a big choker team like pakistan
Starc was waste of time
Fixing match fixing would cup England loser team
Whether it&#39;s any team opposition but it&#39;s satisfying to see Defeat of Aussies in World Cup
Roy is not out
Wonderful bowling from england. Love from india.
I love england cricket team and india
Australia is a wild team

Jason Roy really played like sehwag for England during the entire tournament
I just love the English crowd🥰, very cheerful
Indians fans dont become said because virat is ahead from finch beacause he scored 1 runs in semi final and finch got out for duck

look at the umpire at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=280">4:40</a> he is saying no but raising his finer ......not and out
Stoins out with eng and India 0
Unlike Virat Kohli, Steve Smith scores runs even in the big games. 😢 I wish Virat came big in big moments more often
Eng won by 0 runs<br>Nz lost by 0 runs<br>Trophy should be shared
That&#39;s world cup history man. Those teams never won the world cup whose middle order is not scoring runs. No matter they reaches semi finals or finals or top the group stage as like India.
Eion morgan is ahero

Australia was struggling by good bowling by england archer,chris woakes and adil Rashid
Where was the last wicket of Australia ?
SUPER  ENGLAND
When Jason Roy not out in Semifinal 2 so he hits a century cheaters umpires who giving him out that&#39;s a wide ball I am sad that Jason Roy doesn&#39;t make its century 😞😞😭😞 If u also sad so plz like He made his second century when he was not out in Semifinal 2. 😔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=260">4:20</a><br>Chasing 224 and opener play with this rate.<br>Wow!!!
This match was a dream match ... Beating Aussies in a semi final
Steve Smith forgot how to bowl his bowling career is now over.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=300">5:00</a>😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 actually roy stopped himself because he saw camera is in front of him. otherwise he would clap on the face of his partner🤣🤣🤣

INDIA and AUSTRALIA will take revenge in next world cup.😢😈
Whoever beats Aussies in knockouts, wins the world cup.<br>1996 - SL beats Australia in the world cup final and won the world cup.<br>2011 - India beat Aussies in the world cup quarter-final and won the world cup.<br>2019 - England thrashes Aussies in the semi-final and they won the world cup.<br><br>Similarly in football, whoever beats Germany in knockouts, wins the world cup.<br>2002 - Brazil beats Germany in the World cup final and won the world cup.<br>2006 - Italy beats Germany in the semi-final and they won the world cup.<br>2010 - Spain beats Germany in the semi-final and they won the world cup.
I think unofficially actually we got 2 winners of wc 2019<br>Both ENG &amp; NM EW ZEALAND😊👌💐
I love England cricket team
Smith the alone warrior
England is best
Roy was robbed of a semi final century
Aussies were clearly lacking due to Khawaja’s injury😓
Bairstow should not have reviewed
Very poor decision by umpire for Roy
Roy was the winning Hero of WC2019
Kumar dharmasena..said NO..then out..😂
I was happy because both the teams &quot;ENG and NZ&quot; never win wc ones . England won first time I was happy<br>Ind already won 2 times<br>If NZ won I also happy
Well the scorecards are reversed ,  10 years ago Australia used to have England&#39;s scorecard and England used to have Australia&#39;s scorecard..
India can play wc final with aus but in their dreams😂😂😂
England crushed Australia in this knockout match
Who is watching this in 2020
Jason Roy Play nice
Change the title of the video to &#39;Jason Roy buried the Mighty Aussies&#39;
Never seen this class of batting in any match
England side not great bowlers but still beat other teams easily
plz explain someone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=220">3:40</a> what kind of shot
final ind vs Australia
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=160">2:40</a>, anyone else just go &quot;that&#39;s not bloody unfortunate&quot;
Green in the Australian jersey is unpleasant. Earlier deep green shade was better,especially that which was worn in 2015 cwc and 2017 CT.
Smith run out from 😂😂😂😂
how many watching this in lockdown
Smith again proved he is the Best batsman in crucial matches
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=152">2:32</a> why this match is similar to ind vs new Zealand
Great bowling.
Not the best Australian eleven. stoinis was an absolute wastage throughout the tournament. Australia loose it&#39;s prideful middle order history .That&#39;s not their best bowling lineup. Josh wasn&#39;t picked.Maxwell was in the lineup even after  failed too many occasions.  performance depends only on dev, Aaron Steve and starc. This was the worst Australian line up played in a world cup semi&#39;s in tha last 32years.Aaron was an unlucky captain because he couldn&#39;t win like his predecessors
Very good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=281">4:41</a> if gand phat gayi had a face

Eng and nz the 2 teams for whom no one is jealous
Mitchell Starc...Bowling 149/150+ ...Speed ....But totally went useless....Cause Pace is Good ..But Until u r not using it as a weapon like targetting the Body or well directed bouncers to head or Shoulders..Then World Class batsmen like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23root">#Root</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23morgan">#Morgan</a> will just surpass like this ...<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wellplayedengland">#WellPlayedEngland</a> 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
On my birthday November 15 this year we&#39;re gonna have the same match but as a T20I Final
Admit it or not australia fully fixed that match. Look the shot from Maxwell  !!  really ?  On a batting pitch he played liked that clueless shot !!  they thrashed England in their previous game like they were playing against a school team..but on this match  !! 😪  I can bet this match was totally fixed by england. Well paid Australia 👏👏
Australia would posted 300 if Smith and Carey have played for little longer
An irish has changed the english white ball cricket...england would never have thought to play odi cricket in so aggresive manner.....well done morgan💞

Roy from good bating
Brilliant
Jason Roy makes hitting huge sixes so easy. Same goes for starc , he bowls consistently above 145km/hr and he makes it looks easy. Such simple bowling action
England&#39;s best opening pair Roy and Bairstow
If semi final is between india and Australia then who will win
That&#39;s a brilliant way to shut ricky ponting
Jason Roy dangerous

Roy, the face of fearless cricket.
Its was too easy... Australian batting line up was very poor.
England deserves this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=5">0:05</a> &quot;first ball 4&quot;<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbvx1wUMXc&amp;t=12">0:12</a>  &quot;given first ball&quot;
ICC has perfectly managed to ruin match highlights by reducing a whole match for just 5 to 7 minutes.
