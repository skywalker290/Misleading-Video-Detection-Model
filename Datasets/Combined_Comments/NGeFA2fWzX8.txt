I don’t care how unrealistic that catch was, it means something to me 😭
Roman Pearce, Brian&#39;o Conner, Letty Ortiz, Owen Shaw, Dom Toretto
I would done the exact same thing for my girl like dom did
i do not understand the physics but the clip is AWESOME!!!!
Dom is brave!
Still one of the best moments of Fast and Furious though❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Weon HAY UNA ESCENA
🚔🚔🚔🛻👍👍🔥🔥
Jhþ
Still one of the best scenes in the series
This may be the greatest action scene I&#39;ve ever seen
In the script Letty is supposed to die, but Vin Diesel improvised and saved her. Tge director like so much he kept in the movie

Can you imagine if he missed her hahahaha.
I&#39;ll take <b>My</b> action with Extra cheese, thankyou very much! 😂👌
This is so realistic, this is the cinema - Martin Scorsese
I gave it to Rapheal- hasta i trust her
Read between the lines journal Superior, Program Matter, Scarlet, Original, all handbooks of the Antichrist lets just say he talkin right now think of 2008 snack time it time to eat , 2 blocks
2015 🥲
This was the exact moment Dom turned into Heisenberg
Physics has left the chat.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=156">2:36</a> the power of family
I just turned 21 in 2013 n it was a fun yr til the fall came n it sucked
I genuinely cant tell if some of these comments are supposed to be jokes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=158">2:38</a>  Why does Dom get launched here before the car even hits the wall?
People saying a lot of this scene is unrealistic - literally only the dom jump is ‘unrealistic’ lol<br><br>80% if this screen is completely practical
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=67">1:07</a> I love that moment with Roman and Brian. Just an iconic duo 😅
Man I love this scene!
Dom was already in the air before he wrecked his Daytona to save letty 🤣 I&#39;m now seeing this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=158">2:38</a>
Bollywood style 😂
Is this a remake of The Matrix... Dom is basically Neo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=41">0:41</a>
Screw it boom..<br>Behind the scenes they jumped that skyline like 8 times untill it looked real enough and landed
I had faith
La escena mas ridicula
This is the point at which Dom jumped over the shark an into the AWESOMEVERSE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=150">2:30</a> 😂
He must think he captain America
Me trying to figure out how many takes they had to go through to get the right one
Who needs physics when you have family ?
Y’all still mad that family &gt; gravity and it shows
Eso es verdadero amor
&quot;Yo no sabia que ibamos a caer aca,Tuve Fe&quot;
In next fast furious they will reveal that toretto born in lab with dna upgrade
¡EN EL AIRE, WEON!
Bro,wow!❤
Letty doesn&#39;t have any momentum.
Bro back is too strong
Pff i did that in real life
vin deisel hitting the car saying &quot;augh&quot; was funny <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=160">2:40</a>
Fonzie jumped the shark. Letty jumped the tank.
It was at this moment fast and furious abandoned reality
Although this is over the top this is as close to romance moment that we dudes will watch
Y Vin Diesel dice: &quot;Yo no sabia que íbamos a caer acá, tuve fe.&quot;<br>¡QUEE! ¡!QUEEEE??!!!!
only time I&#39;ve ever walked out of a movie was after this scene
All these movies are so stupid and over the top.. you have to turn your brain off to even slightly enjoy😉
ridiculous!
Will anyone with editing skills please add cartoon sound effects to this? It’s the only thing that fits with this scene.
That white tee stays clean
The physics of this scene makes no sense
My whole theatre laughed when dom flew like super man
This was when I gave up on this franchise
I gave up watching this crap after this movie came out.
The director really thought he was cooking something
أشبه دا رايح جاي
Everyone in my theater groaned at the same time when this happened 😂😂
Es una completa fumada, y me encanta
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=65">1:05</a> The way this scene brings me nostalgia Brian &amp; Roman from 2f2f😭
ooo so thats plot armor
¡¡EN EL AIRE WEOOON EN EL AIREEE!!
It’s just the situational awareness some of these feats require it’s like the characters in universe can see the future
LOL HATERS ARE SHOOK , they just had to come see it themselves
trident 👊
naow
This scene isn&#39;t about realism its about the symbolism that anything is possible with love &amp; family.
i will never understand the people who would watch this scene and say they shouldve stuck to street racing
I’ve never seen any of these movies except this one, a mate dragged me to it when we were away on a work trip, I died laughing in this bit😂
they cut out the best part
Just searched this bc its so funny
Brian and Rome always made a better duo in my opinion.
Revivir recuerdo <br>QUEEEE?!!<br>QUEEEEEEE!!!!! :V
Y vin dieses saleee volando y la otra sale volando y chocan en el aireee weooon, en el aireee!!<br>Quuuee?
Y vin Diesel sale volando!!
The scene that changed the history of cinema !!! 🤣🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=168">2:48</a><br>QUEEEEE!<br>QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!
Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson Vs Luke Evans, Michelle Rodriguez And Joe Taslim
UNPHASED
These two ❤❤ 😭 😭
I demand that Dom should be in next avengers movie to save the earth, as i know he has secret superpowers.
When Roman said “YEAHH!”, That was proof when he was his best friend :(
what’s brian driving here?
Imagine he missed
Wah re secen madarchod toothi car haathi ko gira diya🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣wah re sence
So many awesome classic cars destroyed for a scene, though.
In the air webon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=141">2:21</a>
No one :<br>Some British sergeant in Al-Mazrah :
I can&#39;t believe that Shaw use letty as pawn
Back when Dom still had the infinity stones.
:2:35   Khe Khe??!
Jumping the shark? No, this movie jumped a TANK.
Did anybody hear when dom Landed on the car after saving letty he was like “IEEEEE”
WALLY BAYOLA HAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHA
Vin diesel is Soo brave😵🙀 and strong 💪🙀🙀🥵...<br>This is what is meant when said Partner in Crime 🖇️📌🔥🔥🔥
Still one of the greatest dumbest scenes I’ve ever seen
this would look great on ticktok
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=160">2:40</a> wtf
One of my favorite scenes
Oh I miss Brian O&#39;Conner!! I found out about the show too late.
Ah yes world of tanks in fast and furious be like
Best scene of all of fast and fruits and the reason vin diesel did the impossible because he had family
This scene is what killed the franchise lol
Absolutely loved this scene even tho it was unrealistic lol
Perfect Timing
Tuve fe weon
Doms white shirt is made of vibranium
actually this happened to me once on the bridge over Lake Pontchartrain. What are the odds?
This showed up in my snapchat feed came here to watch the scene i will not be watching the movie .....
Do whatever it takes save your LADY, if you die you die TOGETHER 💪💙

Ridiculous? Yes. Stupid? Yes. Awesome? HELL YEAH!
These Movies are getting ridiculous.
Is a car that size even capable of stoping a literal Tank? I mean i get it was hooked onto something but still....
¡EN EL AIRE WEOOON!!!
Badass
Yogi at its Best
So far this is my fav scene in fast 6
En él aire weon
HES LITERALLY SUPERMAN
Hi everybody just wanted to let you know that god loves everyone and everyone should give most of our time to him he loves you 😊❤️
The Fast and Furious family could stop Russia all by themselves.
A movie for 7 year olds?
I almost walked out of the theater when I saw this.
A reminder the God loves you and Jesus died for your sins 💗
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=159">2:39</a><br><br>QUEEEEE!!!!!!…..QUEEEEEEEE!!!!!?????????
Dom supposed to had been dead 6 fast and furiouses ago
Lol what??
C&#39;mon Dom. Why you gotta always get those pricey and rare cars just to destroy them at the end? I mean, I get it. You had to save Letty. But for God&#39;s sake atleast have mercy on your car.
Why does everyone land on the damn Windscreen?
Nahhhhh this man loves this woman….. that’s love like for real
يصادف اليؤم 30\12\2021 نهايه ؤبدايه سنه جديده يالله الي في كلبي اتمنى ان يصير اليه ؤداعن التؤقيت <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=310">5:10</a> ليلا الى القاع Z ❤
Even more recently he caught a car with his bare hands while standing on top of another car 😂
Yeah the movies are unrealistic af now, but they’re still entertaining
This is what you will need to do to get drivers license in future.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=159">2:39</a>
There lost and noone says anything....now violence Luke the silence of the lambs
We are witnessing the power of Family at its finest form, ladies and gentlemen
I did not know bollywood is invovled in this scene
FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For family
The power family is strong with this one. May the family be with you
Physics died a slow painful death after watching this.
Anything for family 🤧
No PHYSICS was harmed during the making of this scene.
Epic moment !!
This is the best scene in the entire fast franchise for me
This is by a HUGE margin the worst stunt i&#39;ve ever seen whoever came up with that should be boiled in beezlenut oil.
Most realistic scene evah!!
and the bad guy will throw the ball to the open receiver and dom picks it off. INTERCEPTION! All turnovers will be reviewed but dom made sure that it didnt hit the ground
Dom is like a superhero :D
Best actor paul walker 😭😭😭
The superbird tho
Jordana looks gorgeous!
Jordana and Paul look great!
Michelle looks gorgeous!
Vin and Michelle look great!
Best scene in the whole series
you would do anything to save the person you love, if you like it
I think Dom has the super soldier serum
¿Queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee? <br><br>Al español de España
Even gravity gave up for Dom&#39;s Family
Family is the greatest superpower💪🦾<br><br>Hence Proved.
ما تعسرت إلا وتيسرت، وما ضاقت إلا فرجت، وما أبكاك إلا ليُضحكك، وما أشقاك إلا ليُسعدك، وما منع عنك إلا ليُعوضك، وما ابتلاك إلا لأنه يُحبك<br>فاستغفروا الله لعلها ساعة استجابة ❤️
Can a actor tell the director to down play his bullshit scene a little bit?
Tuve Fe
EN EL AIRE, WEON! EN EL AIRE!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=158">2:38</a> he saved her
FAMILY !
When I find the film
Only one thing saved Letty here and it wasn’t Dom - it was family
Tedd in f9: as long as we abide the laws of physics<br><br>Torreto: and I took that personality
EN EL AIRE WEON
we don&#39;t need physics ,we got family.
The power of family
I wanna be just like him when I glow up
Can we get some physics in these action scenes please?
moral in that stund that...&quot;For a real man&#39;s true love he will become super man... At some instinct&quot;
There were reports that Isaac Newton died when he saw this scene
Dominic Toretto: I Believe I Can Fly. I Believe I Can Save Letty.
thats tuff
if the tank can&#39;t go faster than 60kmh + it got a smash car slowing it down and Dom car is probably 120+Kmh speed will it possible to save Letty like the movie?
EN EL AIRE WEON, EN EL AIRE
By the speed he was going it doesn’t require gravity is just good timing ⏱ the car worked as a sling shot for don to catch her in time before she started falling
Dom : for the family
Be honest guys, put the logic in trash can, this scene was epic despite it. I love this series no matter how much illogic it is. At last, cinema is what you find entertaining and no logical.
Gravity: she&#39;s going to die<br>Dom:she&#39;s my family<br>Gravity:Mm ok
Issac newton: No! You can&#39;t just ignore the laws of physics<br><br><br><br>Dom: <b>haha family go brrr</b>
All this talk about Toretto flying.. a tank could never move as fast as all those cars 😂
This is when I decided to stop watching this stuff but I got to be honest it gave me a good laugh for like a good week
Fast and Furious 1: *Physics exists<br>Fast and Furious 6: *Physics has left the chat
😂😂😂😂😂
Who comes to FF for physics? It’s a movie. It’s just entertainment. Y’all want physics? Watch a documentary 🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=67">1:07</a> that little moment between Brayan and Roman hits different now
Whaaat! Whaaaat! en el aire weon
Tuve fe
The family saved Letty
I still think this is the best scene out of any of the fast and furious movies. I would have done the same thing for the woman I love. I&#39;m not saying that it would have been the exact same outcome🙏🏾😂 but I would have definitely crashed and jumped to save her. It would honestly be the only way.
He had faith 😎
En el aire weon! En el aire!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=157">2:37</a> y chocan en el aire weon EN EL AIRE!!!!!
Family
this is the scene that changed the fast and furious series to the Marvel Avengers deleted scenes
Don&#39;t worry guys...he&#39;s got family
People keep forgeting that this is the FF universe and don&#39;t know what law of physics apply there
Dom legit looked like Thor when he caught Letty
Physics of a bollywood movie
En el aireeeee webon!!!!
Fui al cine y no había nada que ver en el cine, y solamente había para ver Rápidos y Furiosos 6. Weon, WEON, y hay una escena... ESCÚCHAME. NO. Hay una escena en la que Vin Diesel está en su carro, en un puente... EN UN PUENTE que tiene un hueco y viene un tanque del otro lado y luego SALE VOLANDO, y Vin Diesel SALE VOLANDO y se enchocan en el aire, weon. EN EL AIRE, WEON. Y caen encima de un carro y Vin Diesel dice &quot;Yo no sabía que íbamos a caer acá. Tuve fe&quot;. ¡¿QUÉ?! ¡¿QUEEÉ?!
Letty got have some WAP cause ain’t no way she got this man defying the laws of physics for her😩😅
This was last fast movie I saw in theaters 🎭
I don’t care what anyone says , after Tokyo Drift this franchise became a complete mess
This is arguably the moment when the fast and furious became WAY over the top
Who needs gravity - when you got family🔥
He saved her because she was his family.
I can&#39;t believe I actually watched this film... ridiculous.
<b>Gravity and Isaac Newton at the movie theaters watching this</b> : &quot;Aight let&#39;s head out&quot;
You don&#39;t need logic  when you got Family?
Probably the most cheesy stunt in the franchise lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=155">2:35</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=158">2:38</a> Doms car crashes twice
Instead of shooting the bridge why didn&#39;t they just straight up shoot the car??
THE CRAZY PART IS TYRESE PART OF JUMPING OUT LOOKS MORE REALISTIC THEN EVERYTHING ELSE
Corny af lmao
All I imagine watching this is Lety being the clay disc and Dom the shotgun.
So bad... Comically bad.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHH
Doms family plot armor
One of the most bullshit fast and furious scenes of all time
Everything seems possible except the landing tbh
Issac Newton - Whats the meaning of this..<br>Dom - It make sense if you have Family
ok f off.
That poor ‘69 Charger Hemi...my favorite car, ruined :(
No just no.
En el aire weon en el aire!
Apparently a solid metal car can break your fall

Tuve fe
This was the beginning of the end for this franchise. It just got way out of hand from here.
Now they&#39;re just copying my Batmobile moves. ;-;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=157">2:37</a> Worst thing is that Toreto doesn&#39;t even seen to be hurt by that.
I&#39;m going to give this movie credit for not having Letty immediately regain her memory when she slammed against the car.
From the first movie to this…🤣
(HERE IS THE GOSPEL MESSAGE OF JESUS CHRIST) JESUS CHRIST DIED ON THE CROSS FOR OUR SINS AND HE WAS BURIED AND HE ROSE AGAIN ON THE THIRD DAY BY FAITH IN GOD&#39;S SON THE LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST AND JESUS CHRIST ONLY SALVATION SHALL BE YOURS AND ETERNAL LIFE WITH GOD IN HEAVEN WILL AWAIT YOU WHEN YOU DIE THE BIBLE JOHN CHAPTER 3 VERSES 16 THROUGH 21 AS WELL AS 1ST CORINTHIANS CHAPTER 15 VERSES 1 THROUGH 5 THE BIBLE
En el AIRE huevon!!!
That is the Brian o Conor way
Torreto ആൾ കൊള്ളാമല്ലോ❤️❤️❤️ എന്ത് jump ആണ് jumpiyath..
I started to almost cry when dom jumped after letty, that is What I call true love ❤️
The most badass saving a person scene in movie history
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=116">1:56</a> a big mistake in this movie guyz how car was still dragged ? a piller came between bridges but car was still dragged by tank🤣😂🤣😂
Shut up about the physics it’s still awesome
Sooo dumb 🤣🤣
If you Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins  then Resurrected three days later and is our Lord and Savior you will be saved ! He who is sinless died on the cross for our sins just so we could be here. He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords from generation to generation! Read your bible daily please  and Repent!! God bless you and your family!💜 ( Not trying to force upon anyone who doesn’t agree)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=156">2:36</a> Letty weighs like what? (lets be honest) 120 and Doms momentum is like he just caught a 5 pound kitten
Ouch my brain the people who consume this is why democracy doesn&#39;t work
This is ok but would&#39;ve been better if a T-REX was about the eat Letty out of the air and Dom came in on a Pterodactyl to save her
Bro...like atleast lose consciousness cmon now
Physics 101: Family by Dom
Friends are trying to convince me to watch the newest fast and furious movie and came back here for reference for why I hate these movies now
his shirt wasn&#39;t even wrinkled
por escenas como esta es que pienso que toretto quedo en coma después de chocar en la última escena de la 1 y esto es un sueño, osea, va a despertar sin piernas jajajajaja
<b>¡EN EL AIRE WEBÓN!</b> <b>¡EN EL AIRE!</b>
That bridge is over 100 metres high, they should have died of a Godzilla size fall.
Toreto is like DIO, they don&#39;t believe in gravity.
Love when people get pissed of by these movies. Makes my day 😂😂😂
Its amazing how a steel cable can magically got right threw concrete i guess they didn’t this anyone would notice lol
Solo vengo a decir una cosa respecto a esta maravillosa escena...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>¡¿QUE?! ¡¿QUEEEEEEE?!

Neo must to learn how to fly in the first matrix film but this guy Mr. Toretto no need to learn how to fly. He can fly across the bridge without getting hurt.
&quot;EN EL AIRE WEON&quot;
After 7 and 8, this is still realistic.
In reality he would just fall straight down
this franchise is a dam joke. Go back to street racing. The first movie had soccer moms racing in their mini vans.
Thank god that glass was there to not cut him once so ever after hitting it doing about 60mph through the air
Everyone talking about how physics is ignored by that jump, but my question is how is the car running from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=150">2:30</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=156">2:36</a>? Doms is on top of the car, how is he putting his leg on the acceleration? Does he have super long legs or something?

This may have been nearly impossible to survive but I gotta say this is one of my favourite movie scenes ever
I am a simple man, when I see anything named Fast &amp; Furious I forgot everything I knew about the laws of physics.
Y Vin Diesel dice: &quot;Yo no sabia que íbamos a caer acá, tuve fe.&quot;<br>¡QUEE! ¡!QUEEEE!
EN EL AIRE WEON
roman screaming sounds like cj on fire
Dom chose family or physics
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=159">2:39</a> how?

Y Vin Diesel le dice, yo no sabía que íbamos a caer acá, tuve fe... QUÉ!! QUÉ!!!!
Poor Mustang 🥲

I came here for Paul walker
Fast &amp; furious movies are just entertainers.. watch it for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY... if you want to learn physics &amp; science then please go to SCHOOL guys...
Legends are here in 2021
This Dude jacked up on heroin 24/7 and gained superhuman abilities
Both of them could have died but this tells me dom has superpowers this would not work in real life

Man! Dom Just ruined a perfectly Good Dodge Daytona!
LMFAAAO
Always cracks me up
QUE????!!!!!!!
Thats love right there. He must really love her.
Not offer nothing special, like American movies are all typical the same crap
If the bridges were a little closer, and he did this in real life he might have bad it.
Dominic Toretto:<br>The Last Physics Bender.
and fast furious its dais very beautiful film
this is the only video that has the most funniest comments ever.<br>and everytime i came here is not for the video but for the comments
I swear dom maxed out his luck stats
I won&#39;t be surprised if dom launched a car from space
🤓 🤪 😣 🤐
This was one of my favorites scenes.👍👍👍
Its A Hollywood action pack movie. Its suppose to go down like that. If you watching for realism, then your watching for the wrong reason. Want real reality? Just wake up in the morning and ohh, ...don&#39;t turn on the TV.

Why has Vin Diesel not been called up by Nick Fury yet? Give the man a car and he can defeat any villain in the MCU.
Owww, this is a superheros movie of course 😅<br>Oh silly me

Dom &amp; Letty hit the car behind them &amp; the Tank flip over on the Bridge with the cable tied around The Tank &amp; With Owens Shaw &amp; his guy inside in Furious 6.

no physic law allowed in this movies..

I can’t Count how many charges r here like police charges lmao
Erode tower 1
Psychics ?
the collision would of killed them both, easily.
Ok Logically speaking, was the car enough to stop him from getting broken into pieces?
all this no one noticed no cops
I honestly find this more believable than when Dom headbutts Shaw&#39;s big sasquatch in the plane 😂😂 He really flew then 😂
Birds walked out mad <br>Birds:cars don’t fly

Vin deasel wouldve went splat and blood wouldve been all over the place the moment he hit that windshield but since its rated PG13, physics just get booted out the window

You guys don’t understand what this scene they want to tell you, they trying to show  that Don loves Letty so much, that he willing to sacrificed his car just to get Letty. For Don, Letty&gt;Car&gt;Realistic
this scene is beyond ridiculous lol.
I just now realized i live there.
Of course, this scene might be amazing.<br>Dom: Fans are family.
Fun fact this is actually possible in real life but both would definitely die or dom has serious injury when he hits the windshield lol

I attempted to work with math on this. Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez weigh 102kg and 54kg respectively. Let&#39;s assume both are flying at 100km/h. That gives Vin and Michelle a total momentum of 2754kgm/s and 1458kgm/s respectively. Now, I assumed that Vin flew off his car at 45 degrees to the road, and Michelle was flung off the tank at 20 degrees to the road (but in the opposite direction, so -20 degrees)<br><br>Splitting the momentum into two components using these assumed angles:<br>Vin = 1947kgm/s parallel and perpendicular to the road.<br>Michelle = 1370kgm/s parallel to the road, and -498kgm/s perpendicular to the road.<br><br>Now let&#39;s assume this is an elastic collision, and that there&#39;s no drag or air resistance. Once Vin and Michelle combine in the air, the components from these momentums combine to make a single object, whose momentum is 3317kgm/s parallel to the road and 1449kgm/s perpendicular to the road. As the perpendicular momentum is positive, that means Vin and Michelle would still move towards the other lane. However, Vin won&#39;t be travelling at a 45 degree angle anymore.<br><br>Calculating the new angle is as easy as calculating the inverse tangent of the ratio between the perpendicular momentum and the parallel momentum, or in easier terms: 1/tan(1449/3317). The final angle comes out to 23.6 degrees.<br><br>Instead of travelling at a 45 degree angle to the roads, Vin and Michelle should now be flying at half that angle and more parallel to the roads. After reviewing where Vin catches Michelle in the video, the outcomes would either be (in decreasing order of likelihood):<br><br>1. Slamming off the blue guard rail and falling to their deaths<br>2. Falling to the deaths without hitting anything<br>3. Landing on the road, not the car, at approximately 83km/h.<br><br>In conclusion, they&#39;re dead, comatose, or if they&#39;re lucky, crippled.<br><br><br>Edit: Okay it&#39;s July 2022 and I&#39;d like to apologise for this comment. In the process of calculating everything, I completely failed to account for <b>F A M I L Y</b> which negates all physical constraints and replaces them all with whatever Dom feels like. For the record, I think the skyscraper jump in Furious 7 could be a one in a billion long shot.

I mean ik everyone is talking physics but leaving out one major point, the car is going at least 60mph when it hits. The car stops but because he is not held down by the car he is still going to fly. We shouldn’t be talking about the physics, we SHOULD be talking about how he was able to aim and time it perfect
Dom keep up, you have broken the force of gravity by from your car to save Letty, I would like you guys visit Kenya in East Africa

Now saving Letty here wasn’t impossible according to the laws of physics, but it was highly, highly unlikely. There’d be a 0.0000000000327 chance you’d actually be able to pull that off
He is like NOKIA 3310 throw him from anywhere then reassemble him as good as new only difference is phone starts with 🤝handshake sign and he is like in thick voice (hahaha family )😂😂
I’m more confused about how a tank was at all affected by an old mustang lmao
Oh look. A bridge. He must&#39;ve just gotten off of gta v or something similar.

There&#39;s a chance(very low) of the catch actually happening coz Dom is heavier...inertia and stuff, but with just a tiny bit of death or serious injuries<br>. There are worse scenes in F&amp;F franchise 😂😂 like Whoa🤯
Late as comment. But I just love the sound of that Ford Escort, especially when he shifts before the jump!
It would be funny if dom not crashed in the car,,instead flying all over the bridge
a fine lie is always better than a bad truth :)
Apparently driving fast cars grants you superpowers. Can you just imagine how powerful Formula 1 Racers are?

1 word ----&gt; Love. Have you ever heard of those stories where mothers pickup cars to save their children? (Yes cars in real life, a toddler even picked up a bookcase to save his little brother -it is on YouTube look it up). People should be 100% willing to do this for their children first and mate 2nd...
Mercedes windshield perfect for landing

I&#39;m sorry DID SOMEBODY JUST SAY A TANK!
So a army tank is faster than a mustang?
Superman
The most romantic scene in movie history
I wonder what the chemical composition of Love is on the periodic table of elements? Any guesses...
This would be stupid even in a superhero movie
😏😎🤔
First of all, he didn&#39;t have as much speed when he shifted from forward to sideways, because the car was still moving mostly forward. He had mostly forward momentum so he wouldn&#39;t have hit the car that hard, but he definitely would&#39;ve gotten hurt. Second of all, the amount of forward momentum he had would&#39;ve been plenty to overcome the gravity for enough time to get across.
I don&#39;t buy that 😂
Dom was lucky there was a car conveniently parked on his landing spot to break his fall. Otherwise he and Letty would have been splattered all over the road. 😂

Risk modhl Dom
Pinche churazo😂
Newton never sacrifice his virginity just to discovered Gravity.
Warning: kids do not try this at home. The results will not be the same.
tried this my girl
It&#39;s possible in real life .<br>I do catch things in mid air while moving.<br>Yeah ! Of course I never tried on bridge.<br>But him measuring the intercepting point and the right momentum is more astonishing.<br>And one more thing,<br>Movies aren&#39;t to be taken literally.
It’s crazy how his shirt got more crisp after the hitting the window <br>If this doesn’t prove that vin diesel isn’t Mr.Clean idk what will
Best scen ever
this scene was inspired by a real incident that happened in 1995 see Shawn Nelson
Newton who ?
Physics: ight imma head out
I think this might be the exact moment the series completely lost its mind

That escort 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
We all know Redick came back to earth that’s why he could do that
Next thing is Dom would be the next avenger having phenomenal superpowers🤣🤣
Speer Speer Dom with another speer
Now this aged like a fine wine!
Dom get out the car jump cross the brigets and saved letty life its was awesome
This is the worst of all F&amp;F movies.
RIP Paul walker
If you want to become One with your girl, try this at home...you’ll become one chunk of meat😂
how cool was dom flying threw the air like that
This is my all time favourite scene from the FF series so far...
That lighting is so inconsistent though. Jeez.
I would have given Goldberg spear to Letty for more safe landing..
-there are fly now?<br>-there are fly now.
Jibba liba this movie really came out in 2013?
Well in this case.. Where was Dom when Thanos almost wiped out the universe my boy Dom let iron man die
These MF bout to have scoliosis and herniated discs.
I like that saving her scene
No one will be seated as Don defies every one of the natural laws to catch his girlfriend
I just noticed that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=118">1:58</a> there’s a pole that the rope completely passes through somehow

So realistic
The intensity in this scene. One of the greatest scenes ever, whether it&#39;s unrealistic or not.
THE ONLY REASON I WATCH THIS SERIES IS FOR PAUL WALKER AND TYRESE!! BIG FACTS
Am i the only one that its hurts me seeing the Daytona get destroyed like that
I just Loved It 👏👏👏😍
This is stretching the laws of physics but Dom would be able to move through the air horizontally perhaps not to this extent because he would still be moving with the momentum of the car, as the force of the wall acts only on the car not on Dom himself. It doesn&#39;t completely defy the laws of physics but it does stretch them quite a bit
Seems legit
Don’t worry his back is made of rock.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=67">1:07</a>  huhu:(
Phew! Thank God that white Tee stayed clean!
Honestly, I don&#39;t care about realism in action movies, the thing is that these movies are making everything way too dramatical and sad, rather than.. I don&#39;t know, enjoyable ?<br>Don&#39;t mind me, I do love dramatic movies, but only when they&#39;re good lol
Joe taslim from indonesia🇮🇩
When I was watching this movie in theater, I didn’t think FF would top this scene..... then the fast 9 trailer dropped and I saw the web slinging car itself.
At that speed both of them should of went through the entire car .... and still die
Wow. Thisbis so bad
Tried this with my girl, we&#39;re in heaven now
The most underrated fast and furious movie.
can’t wait to see how “realistic” the new one is

Everything in this scene is totally possible ....

Aaron Ramsey’ll need to retire his goal killed Paul
Oh my God.....*shakes head* wow. That was stupid. They&#39;d all be dead.

Give Torretto a car and he can do literally everything 😂😂
The physics is bonkers let me explain if the destroyed car that fell and hit the pole that holds the bridge would not shake the bridge and destroy the tank the car would of gotten more destroyed and when he saved lenny the momentum would of crushed the heck out of her and when he crashed into the window he would of went through it because of the speed and probleby killed him

Too much trivial stuff
They should replace vind diesel with ken Jeong. That scene would of been so much better.
Dom👀👀👀Who speaks Afrikaans here?
Wait I thought Groot, Xander Cage, and Iron Giant were his only superhero characters?
The same people complaining about this are the people who unironically enjoy movies about space wizards with glow sticks that come out every December.

Completely ridiculous
DCEU has to recast vin diesel as superman
Edris: im black superman<br>Diesel: Im bald superman
I don&#39;t care how ridiculous it is, it&#39;s still epic.
Letty: &quot;Dude, enough already...would you guys just leave me alone!? I still dont remember any of you&#39;s&quot;
In which part they got married?
Superman
KUAY
This is relationship goals
Wait do you get it Lenny did a different team and then dom did that
It was this scene i gave up on fast and furious movies
And that, Ladies and Gentlemen, is how Dom broke his back.
In Furious 9 they will probably team up with the Autobots and fight the Decepticons
When I saw this part I was ready to walk out. My dad saw this when it aired on Tv he walked out the living room lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=155">2:35</a>, I got goosebumps
U have to be healthy as hell to  catch and land perfectly after u smashed ur spine on a window shield
This is where I stopped watching. What kinda nonsense is this?! Who the hell was the director for this? Agnes from despicable me...guy let his imagination run wild

I saw this in theaters and some old lady yelled out &quot;Oh come on!&quot;<br>It was quite funny

like avengers but with cars
I don&#39;t understand people getting angry at the utterly bonkers physics of this series. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re making Titanic, they&#39;re not bound to make a film that&#39;s true to reality.<br><br>These films have always been dumb fun popcorn movies. Fast 5 was where they really hit their stride, when they embraced how nuts the series was and went all in on being insane.<br><br>These are the sort of films where you just turn your brain off and enjoy some muscular oiled men punching each other in the head and flipping cool cars for a couple of hours.

it was at this point where the rock thought he might lose his role as black adam
In this scene they don&#39;t use FX or stunt actors only use Vin Diesel
Was Dominick a few inches taller than his actor?
First letty betrays the group then get back. Then in Fate of the furious dom betrays the group and then gets back in the group.
Roman&#39;s car couldn&#39;t go under bridge if it wasn&#39;t about &quot;videoshop&quot; . anyone noticed that ?
I feel sad for that W124

Bullshit movie. Too fake

Shouldn&#39;t an impact like that hurt him and knock the wind out of him
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=156">2:36</a>
WTF LMAO
ffs
Newton: Saving Letty was impossible, don&#39;t you have any gravity? <br>Dominic: I don&#39;t have gravity... I got family
The unrealistic bullshit vin diesel make dom do is stupid. We get it. You&#39;re jealous  of the rock taking your thunder. Get over it!
When this happened at the theater everyone was laughing lmao.
Deam
How did Dom not get paralysed there? His back must be made of titanium...

What a bullshit scene
The new fast and furious / Matrix multiverse.
This scene ilustrates love and mechanism of relationships. Very deep.
How are all his ribs not broken from impact
One of the best scene in fast and furious
Brian:cars don&#39;t fly<br><br>Newton:men don&#39;t fly
🤦‍♂️
After this scene Dom can pass as a Avenger.
Complaining about physics? What about all the bullshit dom survives throughout the franchise?

Kkhheeeee!!!! Kkhheeeee!!!!
IMHO this was where they blew the movie....I know no one watches these movies for their realism but seriously 🙄
I am a physics graduate. This is torture 😭😭😭
The way how Dom took that impact on that windshield, it&#39;s exactly how most of us men take the impact everyday though life to provide for our family.. great scene👊😎
The way Dom loved Letty, reinforce the theory (true love is blind)
Vin diesel is my favorite dude in this movie from Rp3

They killing all the civilians.

Look guys it was a paid actors car surveillance

嗚呼、よかった<br>(●´ω｀●)<br>神よ Thanks
After the scene when Dom catches Letty is the point where I stopped watching the Fast movies
okay now y&#39;all are just mad f*cking greedy, this is a Hollywood movie so this doesn&#39;t need to be real just like how it&#39;s not real when they can just rob a millionaire, stop a tank with just car&#39;s, let alone a giant airplane, stop a small army with the help of a secret oraganization, have a gods eye, fight and defeat a high ranking british soldier just by kicking the ground to make him fall in it, steal the key to launch a nuclear bomb with the help of that small army that blackmails people and then stop a f*cking submarine by making it target at the MC to later get it hit the submarine.... it all doesn&#39;t make sense but they were all badass when you first saw it and you know it was. <br><br>edit: it&#39;s stupid but it was BADASS
Let&#39;s face it... Dominic is <i>The Chosen One</i>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=4">0:04</a> Oh look, I’m bored.
What car was Paul walker driving?
Dope
This is when you really have to go take a crap <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=131">2:11</a>

He was a wide receiver
haha simple calculations it could work, though it is a movie, but  the  force of   dominic from his car  crash actually push him forward,but where   you land  after catching her in mid Air, absolutely no idea, any parkour in the house
I thought this is fast and furious not tanks and furious?
Dom got Superman&#39;s power!
RIP Paul Walker

Hey
So the dislikes are because of physics... So what&#39;s the point in watching a modern day action movie if you want realism? Or any movie for that matter
Touchdown 😭

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGeFA2fWzX8&amp;t=157">2:37</a> there in no way he could have timed that perfectly
Lmao
increible
I love this movie.
Actually, given that Dom must weigh at least twice as much as Letty and is moving a lot faster it&#39;s not beyond the realms of possibilty that his sideways momentum would be enough to cancel out hers.<br><br>Did anyone else notice that in the wide shot when Dom takes flight, he does so BEFORE his car hits the rail?
to this day one of my favorite action movie scenes ... go big or go home
Is he toredo or superman
2.35 to 2.38 kya baat hai kya ye scene dekh ke maja aa gaya yar 😈😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
That was cool

The &#39;Stang knows how it feels 2 get tailgated by a Volvo!
Cool
I always thought it was a scene from the first Fast N Furious movie, how silly of me 😋😋😋 !!!!
ohhh good
jajajaja I like the idea of smooth voice.....😉😉😉
First letty betrays dom, now dom betraying her.
When he shifts gear and blazes off the camera
I mean seriously?
Wow
So many good cars ruined for a shitty action film series. Hope they all suffer the same fate as Paul.

Isaac Newton dislike this
Why do I feel like this franchise hates Mustangs?

you should do a movie about Fast and Furious 2001
If you watch these movies as superhero movies, they become way better.

IRL, this wouldn’t have happened. Dom was at least going 60 mph on the bridge. A 1000lb car couldn’t stop a 2 ton tank. The rate of speed dom was going couldn’t have intersected letty safety enough for them to land on a car. The amount of force of impact they had would’ve broke the windshield completely. In IRL, that would’ve sent dom flying over the other bridge and they would’ve died, tragically. I know it’s a movie, but come on guys.....
جميل
Why does Dodge Charger and Challenger was the best cars than Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro in Fast and Furious? Why?
This was when I had to let the franchise go.. I guess I&#39;m too old and outgrew it
That&#39;s crazy stuff.
