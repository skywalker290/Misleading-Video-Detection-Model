Please continue this thanks you
Get titanium or adamantite ore make that type of armor then get the storm bow and get holy arrows and potions + heart lanterns for extra regen kill (destroyer (boss) first) after you kill him, and make asphalt block make area out of it then craft the ( mega shark ) and craft cursed bullets at least 999 of them and kill (twins/boss) then skeletron) craft the hallowed pickaxe with the mech bosses souls and go to jungle mine chlorophyte the green ore then get 3 turtle shells for the turtle armor then kill (plantera/boss) then find the jungle temple and kill golem and make beetle armor/ ASK MORE IF NEEDEDüôÇ
Was it too much to ask that this series would get completed? Obviously it won&#39;t be now because Pewds is living it up in Japan, but man it&#39;s disappointing we never got a full series of this. Full, edited Terraria series are rare as hell.
still waiting for part 7 :(((
Chlorophyte looks like hellstone but green
come back
BOI I just bridge ut to da clouds if  I were you
I thought he might return to the game when the Terraria x Pewdiepie merch dropped,  unfortunately not
This is so bullshit
3 years, PEWDIEPIE!! its been 3 years NOW! WHERES PART 8 WE DESERVE?????
i feel bad for all his viewers, you guys get dry endings xd
We need to get pewds to come back and beat the game
WOW did not expect the rest of the series to need to be paid to watch. Thanks Felix üòí
Terraria&#39;s art style reminds me a lot of legend of the brofist. Who else agrees?
you didn&#39;t beat the game...
how does bro find a hallowed kay and blessed apple within 5 munites
Completed this series on 14/July/2023 around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=1279">21:19</a> (edit) and started 13/July/2023 I forget the time lol but its around 21-23<br><br>(Commented at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=1281">21:21</a>)
Felix: &quot;I beat the game&quot;<br>Terraria: <b>Impending doom approaches</b>
I miss this series
It all returns to nothing
PEWDIPIE COME BACKKKKKK
WE NEED TERRARIA PT7
He had THE BEST SEED for this play through, finding rare godly variants of weapons. Anyone know the seed? I‚Äôve never found a enchanted sword shrine.
where part 7
Yea plssss
Bro really got a hallow key, corruption key, and a turtle shell 2 seconds after getting into hard mode then quit like he wasn&#39;t the luckiest motherfucker on the planet.
This series skips so much stuff. When did you get the mithril pickaxe? When did you get the magical unicorn? Were those parts just edited out?
Imagine hi doing legendary mode, he would get royally clapped lol
I‚Äôve played for hundreds of hours before getting a fucking key and this dude gets it in 30 min
My man didn‚Äôt even manage to cover the surface of the game. It has SOO much more, once you enter hardmode that‚Äôs when the fun things starts to kick in. Too bad the server got discontinued
Why are the next 6 exclusive? Gd üòí
No fing way he got hallowed  key (1 in 2500) and a blessed  apple which has 3% chance to drop
I&#39;m NEVER EVER GONNA PAY TO WATCH ANYONES VIDEOS EVER
The moment he didnt kill the bunny
Bring this back
Bring the series back it was so fun too watch ü§ô
Rewatching
cool
Pls make every vedio public please
Beat mech bosses beat plantera beat golem beat lunatic cultists beat celestial pillars then beat moon lord then you beat the game
When pedwiepie is fighting skeletron prime Rayman 2 music is playing the best feeling
We need part 7
I would love to see more of this series!
bro his character looks like a forbidden jojo&#39;s part 7 character lol
continuation of terraria experience!!! Beat all the bosses :D
Disappointing
Really wish he would&#39;ve just googled what to do when he got stumped instead of streaming the game. With Terraria being as old as it was 8 years after release, loads of people were inevitably going to not have the brain cells to know to not fucking spoil him on what all to do, ruining his sense of discovery and exploration. Pretty disappointing that&#39;s what ended up happening
Bring it back
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=531">8:51</a> he got a turtle shell
WTF IT TOOK ME 3 PLAYERS FINISHING THE GAME TO HAVE BLESSED APPLE
Plz bring this back
Go to Terraria wiki like everyone else
for real tho how is he getting rare items while not trying HAHAHA
The classic people giving up after pre hardmode
Bring it back!!!!
you should use pylons
The vids skip so mich progress but still fun to watch
pewdiepie: can‚Äôt mine an ore <br>‚Äúi beat the game!‚Äù<br>pewdiepie: can‚Äôt beat a boss<br>‚Äúi beat the game!‚Äù
&lt;pweds&gt;i Don&#39;t know what else to do<br><br><br><br>&lt;destroyer&gt;... <br><br>&lt;Twins&gt;... <br><br>&lt;Skeletronprime&gt;...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=510">8:30</a> it is chlorophyte
Now summon king slime
Can&#39;t watch the rest. Lame. Loved the series though.
My man you didn&#39;t finish the game lol
Imagine if PewDiePie randomly scrolled through steam trying to find some good game he can find then he find tmodloader
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=132">2:12</a> <b>Corruption World</b><br>ok so were gonna stop the &quot;crimson&quot; from spreading<br>LOL
just got into hard mode.
dude gets his ass kicked by prime and then said idk what to do
Pewdiepie, &quot; why do I feel like I&#39;m twelve when I play this?&quot; Because he is twelve.
E
Play Modded Terraria!!! Try Calamity first ü§™
THE GUIDE WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO
Dang that&#39;s disappointing that this series was never finished. RIP the fact he thought the game was already over wheeze-
The thing is, if felix didnt hate connor, we probably would have gotten a longer series
Bring terraria series backüò≠
Where update?
please continue this!!
Pewdiepie if you defeat the final boss in terraria , then you beet the game.
pleas bring back the terraria series.
You‚Äôre like 25% done so please bring the series back
There way more bosses to fight
It&#39;s too bad he hasn&#39;t continued this series.
Pewdiepie: I‚Äôve basically beaten the entire game.   Moon Lord: Am I a joke to you?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=277">4:37</a> did anyone else see that pirate walking backwards?
Please bring back this series :(
I feel my heart crack
Ma,e another terraria video plz plz plz
Fighting skeleton before destroyer wtf
he has two keys without even noticing... I&#39;m sad
Pls play more
*is holding the key sword<br>*goes after Prime with the most dinky hardmode yoyo possible
BruhhhüòÜüòÜüòÜ
Bruh this is so hard in mobile with 2 gb ram
The Rayman 2&#39;s ost at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=633">10:33</a> is just too good with the fight !
Me watching this series I&#39;m a veteran playing for the worthy mastermode
PewDiePie: kills hundreds of bunnys innocent<br>Coner: accidentally kills one bunny murderer
Did he never finish this? he just had to get some better armor, maybe kill a couple of mimic¬¥s. you could also farm the wall of flesh to get an emblem you can use, bullying Connor in the process. then you should be ready for a mechanical boss. then beat all 3, and make some hollow armor, get the green stuf ore (chlorophytebeat), beat up plantera. From then on the game can pretty much play it self.
You need to explore the clouds
i cant watch the live stream im stuck in part 6, cant afford to join
Plz Pewds bring this back üîô
Didn&#39;t anyone noticed the painting in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=10">0:10</a>
Get a mithtrl pick axe then get adamntaie
pewds ur next goal is getting titanium armor and killing the threeechanical bosses, preferably the mechanical worm
How the fuck you get a hallow key 5 min into hardmode lmfao
I hope Pewds play Terraria seriously after Skyrim
Miss connor

Pewdiepie where is the rest of this ?

If you pay close attention at the end of the video...he said:&quot;smash like if you enjoyed the series. &quot; wich means that he already ended the series. But I hope I&#39;m wrong.
Please come back you have to break corrupt alters with ur holy hammer u got after wall of flesh then u can get titenum and fight skeleton prime

Parte 7?
YO, this is really important for pewdiepie!!!!! you got the corruption and hollowed key. they can be used in the dungeon to unlock the hollowed and corruption chest. inside the hollowed chest holds a rainbow gun, and the corruption chest holds the scourge of the corruptor, a powerful melee weapon. these chests are found deep in the dungeon after beating plantera. which you summon by finding a small pink bulb in the underground jungle. these bulbs spawn after defeating the twins, skeletron prime, and the destroyer. i hope this info was helpful if you see this!!!!!
Bring it back plsssss

HE GOT A DAMN TURTLE SHELL FIRST TRY
new episode when :&lt;
Just do a expert playtrough ‚Äúits not hard‚Äù eye of cuthulu is hard
I know what to do pewds since you are on pre hardmode, go to the under ground  of the jungle and find the pink glowing flowers and destroy it it will summon a boss called plantera. Mabye after you do it you get a jungle temple key and if you find the underground jungle temple use the key to open the door. And if you see power batteries or something in the chests. and if you go very down to the very bottom of the jungle temple, you will see the alter the light thing, use the batteries and now you have summoned a boss called the golem destroy the golem and go to the normal dungeon at night and then you see cultists around a round coin shaped thing destroy the minions and then you summoned another boss called lunatic cultist if you manage to defeat it it is a very hard battle if you managed to survive and kill the lunatic cultists you see random flesh like pillars, 2 on the right side and 2 on the left side if you defeat one of them you can get these strange artifacts and remember you get a special crafting table when you defeat the lunatic cultist alright after you defeat the pillars you will see a text from the chat that says &quot;impending doom approaches...&quot; build as high as you can and if you wait up high in the night moonlord is now summoned and if you manage to beat him with your powerful gears and all it will drop luminite that helps you to craft with the strange artifacts from the pillars. And you get a epic portal gun and a powerful weapon. make part 7 please i wrote this so you can understand it is not the end of the game. Plus you got this -Epic Gamer
pls bring the series back i already beaten moon lord
Still can&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t get the news that he isn&#39;t even close to beating the game.
Who else is kinda cringing in 2021?
why didnt he finish the game
What a fukin scam he gets  money for us watching him already but to watch his new videos u have to pay for a subscription how greedy are you mate
MARZIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA PEWDS PLAYED MINECRAFT I MEAN TERRARIA ALL DAY !!!! HERE&#39;S PROOOFS <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=422">7:02</a>

The Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes during Skeletron Prime fight were great lol.

I want see teraria again
More terraria?
ive spent so long getting that key
I thought he was being serious for a minute when he said he‚Äôs almost finished the gameüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I missed all gameplay between end of wall of flesh and this episode, where do I find the progress?
Use your f u king nightedge sword
pewdiepie getting the hallowed key and corruption key within an hour feels like a crime
pewdiepie when sees starfury: TRASH <br>when it is literally used to make the most powerful weapon which is the zenith
hey i don&#39;t know if anyone will see this, but is this the version of terraria on the xbox 360 bu on computer? i am so confused cause it doesn&#39;t look like journeys end.
the shell fell from the first turtle you beat. wtf. are you joking
Awww that snowman is so cute.
Yo the three mechanical bosses
Pewds: after sky cities, i think i&#39;ve beaten the game!<br>Me: Well yes but no
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRE
Imagine if he brings back the series after a year
Pls the updates out you promised ü•∫
You didnt even defeat moonlord so ur not finished yet
HE KNOWS NOTHING

Me:Uses the most intense weapons in hardmode<br>PewDiePie:YOYO the this dude
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=883">14:43</a><br>he actually said &quot;smash like if you enjoyed this *series*&quot;<br>his intention was to quit after all...
Go to dungen and use that like purple key
Plzzzzz can u continue playing terraria
·¥Ö…™·¥è: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=131">02:11</a>
Idk about this being legit tbh bc the uploads were wrong or something with episode 3 and 4 I think, not to mention the tower and the designs are pretty good till you see him on camera and it&#39;s scuffed even the little homes are walls all over the place and he said he&#39;s gonna nit pick everything and he did till like the huge skip from ep 2 to 3. Honestly seems like half of his playing time has been off camera so it&#39;s the minecraft ep1 rough and ep2 &quot;hey welcome back, I did some mining off camera and now we have a mob grinder full set of diamond armor neither weapons just got done building a beacon it was crazy&quot; like idk if I really buy it js. Regardless it was fun watching him play but this episode seemed forced and not seamless like the others? Like he was bored of the game and just ran in a circle and didn&#39;t do anything actually or even wanted too. It&#39;s been over a year and journeys end has been out for a really long time and we still don&#39;t have a video, I think he&#39;s given up. He did it for the clicks just like with mc smh. I remember him hating mc and thinking it was so stupid and pointless and just dogged on it everytime someone said something about mc. I really did enjoy the first few episodes but the juice. It&#39;s gone boys... rip.
Just defested Moon lord for first Time. Now I came Back to watch pewds. Sadly he never finished Terraria‚òπÔ∏è
And you can use drills now
Yes
Also yes bring series back, AND WHY U NOT PICK UP TURTLE SHELL NOT LIKE ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO GET IN HARD MODE
Mine titanium, fight mechanical bosses
you can get dog from frost moon I‚Äôm pretty sure

Pewds what happen to your promise
Pewdiepie? Why aren&#39;t u playing anymore
Pewds please continue this series
rip
and when you defeat empress of light in expert mode you will get soaring insignia (endless flying with wings or hover)
mind getting a better wings like the steampunk wings from the steampunker after defeating the mech bosses[skeletron prime,the twins(spazmatism and retinazer),and the destroyer]
that unicorn mount is a rare drop from some of the enemies in the hallow
with the hallowed key you can open a hallowed chest in the dungeon but you must defeat plantera first
He needs to play expert or master mode to get the exclusive boss items and loot bags.
Should we tell Felix that he needs to defeat the Moon Lord before he can officially beat the game?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=26">0:26</a><br><br>remember?<br><br><br><b>fa-fa-fabulous</b>

If Scrabble and Minecraft have less than 5% similarities, how much greater than 60% have Minecraft &amp; Terraria have in common?
the hallowed key is used for golem&#39;s temple in the jungle
well will the king return to reclaim his pixel throne
Months later i am still having a seizure over how he‚Äôs just casually flexing a hallowed key
Why did you not continue this game you stoped at the begging of hardmode where you have 3 mechanical bosses to fight the destroyer, the twins and skeletron prime also you should go deep and mine adamantite/titanium depends what your world has.
Bruh why did he stoppppppp?
Bring seris BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why. Haven‚Äôt. You. Finished. It.
Please Pewds, I love this series. Bring it back
You dont get fall damage with wings on even if you fall fast
alternate title: yoyo bride and her magical unicorn vs terraria
I hope he continue his 1.3 playthrough
he forgot plantera twins destroyer and empress of light even moonlord and he forgot event bosses and invasions:pumpking ice queen santa NK-1 mourning wood and Everscream even the goblin summoner miniboss solar eclipse and mothrom mini boss

Dude he had hallowed key and currupt key
you should make a episode where you try to get ken to play
How on earth  chlorphite ore is there before he defeated 3 mech bosses??
BAKA CONNOR
Focus on getting souls from the different biomes, defeat the destroyer and the other mechabosses which will cause plantera to be able to spawn. Get more health from life fruits in the jungle biome. Get the key to post plantera dungeon where you can defeat the golem boss which unlocks new npcs for example. The lunatic cultist will also spawn which is another boss that you need to kill in order to defeat the moonlord and complete the game. Other than that there are many other events and bosses you have not finished but they are not mandatory!
If your not gonna keep playing terraria then at least play Minecraft
Go to old mn hause to open chest
Craft pick axe cobalt
Mr pwed get some life cyrtal

There is a reason why you follow order and dont rush the game lol<br>You kill mechanical worm first so you can craft the megashark and with it you kill the twins and skeletron
Holy F!<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=126">2:06</a> That‚Äôs Elsa with The water spirit and Olaf.

Don&#39;t mess with it<br>Then why you died?
You have to get the Daedalus storm bow with holy arrows then tackle the destroyer, make some hallow armor ad use the bow
JOJO REFERENCE!!
tap the apple two times
he needs to try and fight the moon lord
I don‚Äôt want pewds to take this as offense but I hate when he literally does so much off cam and I think I missed and episode and he just gets so much good stuff I know this an old series but still
Imagine Pewds Battling Empress of Light
T series has more subs
He claims he finished the game forgets one boss moon Lorde
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=42">0:42</a> you gotta be joking its like 1 in 4000 chance to get it.
Mothron dropped eye of Cthulhu mothron also drop broken hero sword
I kill the iron boss using<br>Eye of Cthulhu (yoyo) dropped by nothing also nothing drop broken here sword can be summon solar eclipse

@Peter struass<br>I don‚Äôt think that He really gave up on it he just doesn‚Äôt know what else to do.
I‚Äôll Try to get you the recipe for the sword later but for now you need to focus on getting better armor and more HP also get rid of those garbage Yo-yo‚Äôs those yo-yos that you have are not very strong. But don‚Äôt worry if you like yo-yos that much there are some in hard mode that are far stronger than the ones you have.
You use a Clementator with the ammunition from the Cyborg to get rid of the corruption.
Any Indian???
OMG I HAVE TWO JOJOS <br>Me:Laughs in a gadget its name I dont remember.
Imagine Pew against Supreme Calamitas
Moonlord and Empress Of Light: Hold our drinks

You can found another hearts of life on the Jugle.
when you learn about the mechanical bosses and think you are done... one thing lead to another and you find yourself fighting a bunch of aliens and celestial beings and you don&#39;t even know what TF you are doing anymore.
Pewds haven&#39;t beaten moonlord yet lmao
U should continue the series                                       Anyone else? &lt;3

Pewds kill captain I‚Äôm the captain now
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=100">1:40</a> that‚Äôs a unicorn not a horse<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=110">1:50</a> THAT A SHARK
So let me understand, you&#39;re an eye-patch, leaf-winged, unicorn riding, bride ridding the world of corruption with Yo-yos? That sounds like a cover for Sailor Moon.
Please continue this series pewds
Pewds finish the game
hey pewds
U Should craft frost armor and the storbow then u can easily kill the 3 mech boss the twins, destroyer,skeletron prime
Wow you got this in 0.67 chance üò≤üò≤üò≤
Upload another episode of terraria or im subscribing to T. series
Pewds please
everyone is talking about this being the last terraria episode, but really im sad cuz it is the last thumbnail of his stinky face
Felix:*accidentally summons skeleton prime*<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Everyone liked that</b>
bro so lucky to have 2 keys before even defeating a mech boss
Me: plays  100 hrs and never gets a hallowed key<br>Pewds: plays for five minutes, kills one enemy and t drops it.
The old man is the clotheir
How did he get chlorophyte when he hasn&#39;t defeated the mech bosses yet?
6 months later and his 1.4 playthrough ended the exact same as this one; early hardmode, gathering titanium and failing to kill a mechanical boss.
keep going
I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW DAMN LUCKY THIS MAN IS LIKE BRUH!!!!!!
–Ø —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π
me no monaey
brooooooo you putting killua when you said two yoyo&#39;s made me renew my faith in you.
You‚Äôre supposed to be all the mechanical bosses then defeat Planterra then you get all the keys turn into non-cursed keys then you can unlock really good chests then you defeat the golem from the jungle temple The last boss you battle is the moon lord
&quot;JOJO&quot;<br><b>Shows image of Killua</b><br><br>(Not a mean comment. just thought it was funny)
I also got the last prism
I got the best weapons on terraria plug it‚Äôs so cooooooool!!!!!!
How pirates summoned in softcore
I Can Imagine People That Don&#39;t Play Terrraria Acusing Him Of Using Creative Mode.
theres something called terraria wiki
Do more!!
Bring this back please
After I will complete game the last 5+ bosses excuse me
I cant watch terraria, I don&#39;t have money
who still play terraria in 2020
Joergen the Unicorn :D

Smash alters in the corruption to get titanium/admantite to spawn and get armour of them
i have nyan cat as my sword
You think your ritch? I got 15 platinum in EXPERT mode.. now Pewdiepie is the small pp

The skeleton is skeletron
He really said ‚Äúlet me find the sky island I will have beaten the game‚Äù
too bad that you need to join the channel for a series that was available to anybody

It‚Äôs genuinely annoying, you left it like at 10% completion.
Bring this back
hey pewds if you take the witch doctor moves to the jungle and then at night he will sell wings :)
it hurts me that pewdiepie sounds like dio when he says jojo
Terraria reminds me of the escapists for some reason
you still haven&#39;t killed the plantera and the Golem , which is one of the hardest bosses in the game
Im almost triggered I can&#39;t watch the rest of the series
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=443">7:23</a> Polnareff looking for his sister like:
i think he finds exploring and finding new things to be more interesting than fighting 50 bosses in a row, so i cant blame him for not wanting to continue, or feeling hes finished
clothier=old man
PewDiePie has gained more subs but has seemed to have dropped out of the public eye a bit, makes it way more calm
Use the clentaminator it&#39;s so useful and it will get rid of the corruption
Pewdiepie : I haven‚Äôt found sky cities I think after that I beat the game<br>Every terraria pro : <b>laughing intensifies</b>
Haha, too bad you didnot know steampunk.
Owen ambrumsin
I always thought that the floating island was like beginning of the game that‚Äôs why the stuffs not good
Pewds defeats the wall of flesh in one try and gets out alive<br><br> Also pewds: Dies in the middle of a pirafe invasion
YOU PROMISED BRO<br>U GOTTA DO IT<br>OR A PHANTASAMAL DEATH RAY WILL SPANK YOU
Hey Felix here is something to do <br><br>Terraria: The Terra Blade (Tutorial)<br>Step 1: Craft Night&#39;s Edge Sword.<br>Step 2: Make Excalibur from Hallowed Bars.<br>Step 3: Make True Excalibur and True Night&#39;s Edge using one Broken Hero Sword each.<br>Step 4: Combine True Excalibur with True Night&#39;s Edge to make a Terra Blade.
To beat the game you must kill the moon lord
Pls play again pewdie pie
Pewds ‚Äújojo‚Äù screen: hunter x hunter
Fight moonlord to end series
He gets excited for platinum when he doesnt care about cobalt
Do part 7&gt;:(
i can&#39;t afford to be a member :(
Next fight mech bosses
Pewdiepie: Did you know that I was riding this unicorn backwards?
go to the dungeon an find the hallowed chest
all of the keys for the chests are in the dungeon. In each biome there is a key and if you kill enough mobs you might get the key. It&#39;s a 1 in 10000 chance you will get one. I know im the 22,870th person commenting but I hope it helped!
Sucks to know that pewds still opens the door
you promised dont break it felix dont break that promise
Wouldnt it be funny if he ran into a wyvern
Weeee
wings
That character is a gay polnareff
bro that was the rayman soundtrack when he fought skeleprime
Btw, the beam sword is a 0.3 chance to drop from skeletons.
If by any chance your down to mod it, hit me up for some fire modsüëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
ur not close to done
y is pewds doing every thing i did as soon as i got hardmode (leaf wings, unicorn.........)
U beat the game when u kill moon lord
Me, a terraria veteran watching him fight the hardest mechanical boss without titanium or adamantium armor:
Bruh guys he is already playing terraria journey&#39;s end.
You should do a Journey&#39;s end play through.
Beat the three mech bosses, make light discs, curse the old man to make him skeletron and kill him then explore the dungeon bellow and find the hollow chest for that one key, stay on the floating Island and wait for a wyvern to spawn so get souls of flight to make better wings, after the mech bosses go to the jungle and find a pink blub but don&#39;t break it it summons plantara so dig out and build an arena around it, after that kill it a few times it has a few good items, then you can open the big temple but first you wanna get three turtle shells by killing the big turtles in the jungle to make the the turtle  armor, then after that your gonna wanna make an above ground glowing mushroom biaom by putting a layer of two mud blocks to about 100 to 150 blocks stretched across the over world the then place a glowing mushroom seed on the mud and let it spread then bulid a suitable house there then get the mushroom spear, after all that then go to the temple and explore carefully there&#39;s a lot of traps but you can collect the traps for farms, collect all the lizhard cells to summon the gollem boss  then kill him a lot cuz he gives you one of the best pickaxes and beetle shells which can be used to make your turtle armor into beetle armor which will give you around 93 defense, then go to the new hard mode dungeon after those bosses
Impending doom is approaching
god if poods really gets hooked then imagine him playing calamity, i would absolutely love to watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=278">4:38</a>: omg there‚Äôs a pirate moon walking that‚Äôs epic!!
It&#39;s in the dungeon all of your keys
I rlly want you to keep on playing terraria so here r some things that u need to do to complete the game 1.Defeat all mechanical bosses 2.defeat plantera in the jungle by looking for some plantera bulbs after u defeated the mec bosses 3.defeat golem in the jungle in the jungle temple 4.defeat duke fishron in the ocean biome by getting these special types of worm bait 5.defeat the alien invasion idk what it‚Äôs actually called or you could go straight to the lunatic cultus at the dungeon 5.defeat the 4 pillars sola nebula stardust and vortex 6.then finally defeat moonlord then u r done so i hope this helps and i hope you carry on with this series and play terraria with new update
Just a pro tip from a god once you kill wall of flesh up your almost half way done with the game.
Ufo uhh kill them they invade!üò≤<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=796">13:16</a>
OMG THE HALLOWED KEY IS A 1 IN 2500 DROP 0_0
Von str√∂heim
Some things you could do:<br>Bosses-&gt; Eater of Worlds, Queen Slime, Destroyer, The Twins, Skeletron Prime, Plantera, Empress of Light, Golem, Duke Fishron, Lunatic Cultist and Moon Lord.
Get adamantite or titanium and upgrade
Felix there is still ALOT to do considering i play terraria myself and i am already pretty far.<br><br>But you still have to defeat: 3 mechanical bosses, plantera, the golem, the lunatic cultist and last but not least the moon lord. I still have to defeat the last two myself.
Looks like he&#39;s completed the game.
Pewdiepie, you have to play the new  update
Terraria now has star platinum loll
This shit ain‚Äôt fair. U NEED TO PAY TO BE ABLE TO WATCH MORE-

The reason his hair is flat: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=714">11:54</a>
And the final boss in terraria is MOON LORD
The pirate invasion was a event not a boss<br><br>When you reach 50% the flying Dutchman will come
YAAAY FELIX CAME BACK TO TERRARIA
Felix looks hella tired
Lol its very funny that pewds claims that he had beaten the entire game
I&#39;d really LOVE to be able to watch the newest streams, but I unfortunately am unable to spend the $200+ I have at my disposal

Bring it back
Where is part 7?
I cannot wait for his reaction when he tries to finish the game and encounters the moonlord<br>he might be like &quot;WHAT THE +BLEEP+ IS THAT THING!?!?!?!?!?&quot;
Hey YouTube can Go to the donjon and Youse your jungle key
He cant stop the series because he has not beat the game yet lol
Imagine Felix playing in Master mode<br><br><br><br><br><br>The whole world would be a graveyard
Finish game
You know u can put coins in chests so u won&#39;t lose them everytime u die right....
ToDo:<br>Get mythril pickaxe to mine adamantite/titanium<br>Get titanum/adamantite Repeater and armor<br>Fight Skeleron prime, the twins, destroyer, and if you find a gelatin crystal in  the underground hallow, queen slime aswell<br>Then there&#39;s a bunch more of bosses but this avobe is enough  for like 4-6 episodes (3 or 2 if you do 3 mechs in 1 episode)
Get a full set of titanium/ Adamantite armor, and that should protect you more for the bosses, and try to get shadow flame knife (From hard mode goblin army)
Still waiting for The seventh part.
Come back father
Did anyone else get anxiety when he didnt pick up the turtle shell
How come you dont explore up on the sky, there are many chests with lots of new swords
PLAY IT
pewds go to the ocean and kill acuatic enemys as jellyfish and sharks, they can give u a treasure map, if u use it u will summon another pirates invasion, do this until the captain pirate drop u his sword, one of the best melee weapons pre planterra, it will be useful,  u have to kill the 3 mechanic bosses so they will give u a new ingot, the best ore of pre planterra, u will be able to do useful tools and weapons like the excalibur, then planterra bulbs will appear at the jungle and u will unlock a ore called chlorophyte (better than the ingots of the mechanic bosses, and create better things and armors with it)  , and if u destroy one planterra will summon, kill it so starts pre golem stage, but before u try this u will need to equip well, cos it will be difficult, its no so easy and there are 2 stages more, pre moon lord and post moon lord, with important events after and before.
pewds: what else is there to do <br>Me: laughs in terrablade
Pewds pls bring this series back pls and also you don&#39;t take fall damage when your wearing wings actually.
Soon he will rise again
PLEASE CONTINUE
Bring this back for journeys end: newest update
Are we just going to ignore the fact that  pewdiepie made his character Polnareff
Pewdiepie you have the voice of flamingo
I cant take pewds seriously rn in the video when I&#39;m looking at him, he looks so immature compared to him with a beard
To stop the corruption use the clentamanator and use the ammo green solution all bought from the Steampunker and shoot the clentamanator at the corruption to turn it back to normal.
PewDiePie beaded Terraria me you are not even close to the end<br><br><br><br><br><br>You just started
If you make more terraria videos i will like every single one i promise
Keep up the terraria series!!!!! (After ur break lol)
How the heck did he have the hallow key already
i DoNT kNOw wHat To eVeN do AnyMoRE whhyyyyy has this series died you even said you liked the game
R.I.P <br>he lost his save
You didnt beat the game! you need to beat the moon lord!
Please do more episodes of terraria
Go fight da moonlord, twins, skeleton, Duke fishron, destroyer or all the other onesüòÇ
Pewds play more terraria
What happening to terrira
Please more
Play more
i love u, and i miss u, huuuuuuuuu, HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Can you play modded terraria?
and the way he cut off the corruption wasnt actually that bad to be fair.
at least pewds is trying.
Btw you need a mini shark&#39;s older brother  with ichor bullets the ichor will reduce their defense
HE GOT THE AMAROK AND THE ICE SICKLE AT THE FIRST DAY ?!, look at me, day 20 no yoyo, no ice sickle<br><br><br><br><br><br>bruh
Did PEWDS defeated the ocram and the fishron?Plantera?Moon Lord?<br>The Mods?
Seach up chippy gameing he dose a hardmode guide
The hollow key is for a hollow chest
Next you need to kill the mechanical bosses, Destroyer, The Twinz, Skeleton prime. after that the jungle starts spawning pink bulbs, you break those to beat plantera. once you kill plantera you kill golem in the jungle with the key from plantera, then you fight lunatic cultists at old man&#39;s dungeon. then kill him once thats done fight the celestial pillars kill those summon moon lord OP boss btw then kill him the kill Empress of light then you finished the game!
WHY YOU DONT USE YOUR ICE SIKLE!!!
Pewds: who knew pirates where rich<br>Me: everybody that&#39;s why they hide there treasurea
Pewdipie: i beat the game<br>Me: ????üòÄ¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø
Pewds: I AM DONE ONCE I FIND SKY THINGS<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>DUDE YOU FORGOT LIKE 10 BOSSES YOU IS EVIL
Says that he thinks he‚Äôs done everything while wearing cobalt armor
Nurse is no longer immortal
He was a yo-yo master even back then
FINISH GAMe, ON CAMERA
Has he even beat a mechanical boss?
U still got so many bosses to do XP
I hope he knows what reforging is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=421">7:01</a> JOJO REFERENCE
WHAT HE IMMEDIATELY GOT A TURTLE SHELL
Tip: you should defeat The Twins, The Destroyer, and skeletron prime so that you could get the pickaxe axe and get the steampunker number one the pickaxe axe is the thing that could get that green thing that did not break or so called chlorophyt and the steampunker for the more efficient way to stop the corruption from spreading.
Now finish the game! Like if you agree
GUYS ITS OK <br>HES BRINGING BACK THE SERIES<br>HE SAID IT IN &quot;bye minecraft&quot; VIDEO<br>so yessss
Plz bring series back
my guy really found chlorophyte and couldn&#39;t mine it but still thought he beat the game
ok felix, you need to mine some adamantite ore. its a red black color and you need like 300 of it so mine a lot the make a mechanical worm with 5 iron bars, six souls of night and 6 rotten chunks. then wait till night, summon it and use the nimbus rod you got and attack the probes it summons while your nimbus rod kills the boss.
Idk how to play this game
update came out a while now, hope he uploads Journeys end 3 new bosses. He didn&quot;t complete this world yet either :p
1.4&#39;s here bring it back aaahh
its been over 5 months and im still waiting for this series to continue
Me when I see a jojo reffrence: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zH_4RPaCvI&amp;t=130">2:10</a>
i recomend watching how to play series on youtube just please watch
I can‚Äôt wait for the series to come back
PewDiePie after that I should‚Äôve eaten the entire game everybody who‚Äôs ever played Terraria I‚Äôm getting triggered there‚Äôs like 10 more bossis
No I want to see PewDiePie fight the Mac bosses that would be hilarious there‚Äôs no way he would win that fight if he struggled with the Flying Dutchman I‚Äôm almost at the moon lord and it‚Äôs almost impossible to kill it‚Äôs still hard for me to kill the Dmac bosses
felix you still arent even 20% in the game excluding calamity and other mods :D
It‚Äôs annoying that he randomly left this series alone üòî
You have to find plantera small rose like growing bulb randomly spawns in jungle you need a lot like a of space to fight
He put so much effort to the editing (or the brad did it) Rather than the minecraft. <br>The conclusion is that he loved terraria, so sad he didn&#39;t make it to the end since 1.4 came out
PETITION TO REPEAT THE WHOLE SERIES AND PLAY THE MASTER MODE XD
Chill people .He will play terraria again when the update comes out .
BRING THE TERRARIA SERIES BACK PLS
moon lord is last boss
or happy days
watch chippy couch or chippy gaming
theres like 12more bosesslol
Wait till it says ‚Äútonight is going to be a terrible night.‚Äù
Bring the series back
he got 2 of the keys before knowing what a destroyer is
Bruh what happened? Part 5, he had hellstone armor and just defeated the wall of flesh and my dude just gets cobalt stuff out of nowhere.
Pewds, it&#39;s not unfair or cheating if you need to look on the wiki or anywhere online when you don&#39;t know where to go. You aren&#39;t even halfway through the game!
Plz do more
That moment when Pewds says he beat the game but still hasn‚Äôt even beat a mechanical boss: T_T
I rewatched this series after Pewds said he&#39;d bring this back. We may have to take a break from Minecraft, but we&#39;ll have a new and Fun series in Terraria!!
Why not you continue it :(
Pewds: *Gets hallowed key in less than 5 minutes<br><br>Me: Impossible
where&#39;s part 7 lord pewds?:(
hey 1.4 is out now
Hey pewdie continue terraria please
Pewds Jouneys End is out can you please play?!?
