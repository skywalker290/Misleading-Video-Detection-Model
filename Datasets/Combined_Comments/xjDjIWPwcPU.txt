I have saw this movie
I have watched this movie at 2:15 pm today and it was great and perfect black panther movie
To the one and only Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman - may he be at peace and joy in God&#39;s Wakanda. 🙏🏽🕊️🙏🏽
No sharks they sent me emails
When will we expect the white phanter?
I want to watch this movie tonight.
My favorite part of the movie was when T’Challa went “it’s panthering time” and panthered all over the place. Truly the Marvel movie of all time.

Happy Birthday to the late Chadwick Boseman you always be remember <br><br>Wakanda Forever 🖤
This was badass.... now it hurts to watch.
Rf
When you see this and then you think about BP2. The differences are hard to miss. Wakanda was a patriarchy. You had to fight the strongest man to have the right to be king. You had to risk your life if you want to rule. Now Wakanda is a hereditary monarchy. Did his mother beat M&#39;Baku in combat? No. She&#39;s just Queen for reasons. Shuri is Queen for reasons. The king&#39;s guard is now the only army. Its basically Woman King in the MCU. They replaced and degraded all the male characters. They used the excuse of Chadwick&#39;s death to do what they did in EVERY other movie post-endgame. Pretend it&#39;s a story about men, but really it&#39;s a story about new perfect women replacing the useless male characters.
Passei para relembrar as experiências boas que nos deixou. Obrigado por ser uma lembrança boa para as novas gerações.
Y&#39;all don&#39;t even realize what&#39;s happening. These black panther movies are a cover up so that you forget about the real black panthers(The Black Panther Party). Open your eyes. Stop being ignør@nt
I remember being in the theater an this trailer played and everyone clapped.

Chadwick Boseman Forever !! ❤❤❤❤❤
He was and will remain the best representation of Black Panther!!
A definitely awesome trailer. Great music, great visuals, and great performances.<br>I love the line: &#39;The Revolution will not be televised. The Revolution will be LIVE!&#39;<br>Wakanda Forever!
THE GOOSEBUMPS TILL THIS DAY! 😭🔥
Killmonger should be revived as king &quot;he has learned&quot;
Wow!! I truly forgot how amazing this trailer was! By far this is my top 5 movie of all time not only this is a great superhero movie this is a great movie in general marvel please recast the king because Shuri is not it for me
Best trailer i&#39;ve ever seen, makes me wanna run through a brick wall

I don&#39;t care what they say about this movie<br>One of the best movies in MCU<br>Rest in peace mr Boseman
Still a Legend in 2023 ❤❤
To be honest I tried to watch the 2 movies but had to laugh so hard when the actors tried to speak English so I stopped it because I wasn&#39;t in the mood for a comedy movie. This is even worse than watching Dragon Laird from Teutonia when people try to cross his genome with monkeys just for the fun of it. But we see every day that people of color have a lack of school education when they call themselves black even if their just brown and I am not talking about the university here.
Anyone with the link on how I can download this movie, please help

This trailer still goes unbelievably hard. RIP Chadwick
how can i download the full movie
Marvel will never top this movie 😭
I hate this movie and almost every character in it for no particular reason. <br> - 👴
Where is White Panther?
😁😁😁 hahhah
Still Classic!  WM&gt;NFMLV!

Trailer itself deserves an oscar.
Whites were to busy building cathedrals out of Roman concrete to be interested in colonising black people&#39;s mud huts.
Don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t follow-up with a similar style sequel. This trailer is so good.

My dream hero is Black Panther. I was worried about not being African.. Not anymore.
OMG, what&#39;s the world coming to when the blaxploitation inspired James Bond movie &quot;Live And Let Die&quot; (1973) depicts African culture more accurately than this Marvel film? And The James Bond movie wasn&#39;t even trying too, it went for straight stereotypes and sensationalism to increase the humour, excitement and tension in the movie and it still manages to be better at authentic African culture that this immature random mess of a Marvel film.

This movie true masterpiece
Wakanda for ever just wow we miss u our black panther😢😢😢.
The Revolution will be Live 🔥🔥
Black penther are you in Kenya
Story Sucks
That was half of half kingdom cousins ...<br>Because one of them grow up royalty value and education and such as Alien of sky or witch ör death awake ,<br>But he did not win War .<br>The other of them grow up poorly and non education and humanlity but he won every War nearly almost all of them , Even if the last War did nor accept to succesfully.<br><br>And then for thus they are half of half kingdom cousins royalty value,<br>What happened outside the metal of vibrabium lived ? What did u do such wildly animal ?<br>Why did u not keep on life such as royalty ? And also he nearly always same life such as head on own hand ... <br><br>Even if he won War of protesto attack War , they are equalty War and also just blood kingdom

I get goosebumps from this trailer🔥. RIP CHADWICK BOSEMAN🙏🙏😞
Marvel sure makes absolute junk.
Nah not me…….but I have a few good men in mind ❤
Watching this after 5 years when wakanda forever can and the one and only black panther aka tchalla aka the black panther
Classic
I don’t care how many years this is, it’s always a good movie. rest in peace Chadwick Boseman
RIP Black Panther 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Long live the king😞
goodd
This one is better than wakanda forever😢
First 40 seconds 🔥
This music reminds me of the DOOM ost - at dooms gate
The playlist of this movie is fire.
It&#39;s been 5 years this trailer still hits diffrent
Peak MCU time, peak trailer and an amazing actor.
Chadwick was a TRUE hero in real life! Fighting cancer, and still bringing a smile to our face! Rip to you goat! 💔 ❤ loves forever
This is a classic 👌 it set a different standard for marvel. If it&#39;s your favorite then ohhh boi don&#39;t I have  a Quiz for you.  True fans only though 😂, if you are not you&#39;ll surely be exposed but you can try.😮
And then despite Chadwick&#39;s direct request to re-cast his character they made Wakanda Forever into diverse and inclusive mess with Shuri becoming a new Panther, which made no sense storywise whatsoever.
Yee can y&#39;all extinct my lion thru time in reverse I don&#39;t like body swapping it&#39;s disgusting it&#39;s only for losers and ugly people @Africa I don&#39;t want to be alive no more cause of simulation self pods and etc I&#39;m. Straight
Çok güzel
GUYS I SERIOUSLY HOPE THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE CAN REDEEM ITSELF AGAIN AT THIS LEVEL OF TIME DUE TO PHASE 4 NOT HAVING THE SAME HYPE THE MCU WAS AT ITS PEAK DURING BLACK PANTHER, AVENGERS INFINITY WAR AND AVENGERS ENDGAME MAYBE THE MCU SET THE BAR TOO HIGH?
As a South African, I have to agree that Ulysses Klaue reaches the pinnacle of most South African name ever. Though I would have personally gone for Barend Van Der Merwe... or Kristian Pretorius.
Why all the time good people get Cancer and those Bad politicians are not?<br>I am sure there is no GOD
This movie sucked
Àa
After 5 years I still come back
actually, it&#39;s racism, why do only blacks live in wakanda?
What a complete retarded and racist shitmovie....
A joke that is all this is goodday..
Man the difference between parts 1 and 2 is a lot. Part 1 never could compare with part 2. It&#39;s 100% better
A highly advanced black society... I like science fiction, but this is jumping the shark.
Glad we re not of that would
I&#39;m gonna obliterate Wakanda
what&#39;s the song plz that&#39;s so dope
Last movie I saw in the theater like five years ago it was really good
I have a pretty cool and inclusive idea, what if in the next black panther movie - the main character and super hero is a middle aged white guy? What you guys think?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU&amp;t=105">1:45</a>
R.I.P CHADWICK BOSEMAN
Good times when marvel hadn&#39;t gone woke 😮‍💨
5 years old!<br><br>An operatic comic book film I gotta say even though it falls short of pitch perfect.<br>The cast is excellent, the African culture is spot-on with the costumes and colors, and hits some great politics.<br>The look of Wakanda is pretty impressive not only appearing as large skyscrapers but also feeling grounded with traditional architecture of stone homes and hut villages making it a character.<br>The music is a cool mixture of African instrumentals and hip-hop tunes.<br>There’s just a lack of big action set pieces, not that much Black Panther in the actual film, some of the CGI looks cartoonish and they really did waste Andy Serkis after he had such a cool intro in ‘Age of Ultron’.<br>But the film is a breakthrough bringing so much African American influence bringing a lot of attention about what a third-world nation can still offer. <br>I’m happy this is a game changer as far as portraying black superheroes socially and having big cultural significance.<br>Touches upon racism, colonialism, slavery, unification vs isolation, and choosing between kingful duties and the warrior&#39;s way.<br>Killmonger is a very sympathetic villain next to Loki and you get why he does what he does particularly when it comes to how history has treated blacks in the past.<br>It’s cool the female characters are strong, intelligent, resourceful and wise.<br>‘Black Panther’ not only acknowledges and celebrates traditional African society, but also debates, the power and beauty of black women, and the complications of family dynamics. <br>Heck it even unpacks various types of masculinity while doing so. <br>Dads shouldn&#39;t afraid to have tough conversations with their kids next to admitting making mistakes.<br>It might shatter the pristine image of &quot;manliness&quot; but honesty and openness strengthens the relationship. <br>It&#39;s okay to stumble cause you learn from the experience. <br>Marvel Studios achieves big time with this one; Overall it&#39;s a statement of positivity disavowing cynicism and embracing death as a change of worlds--knowing we will see our loved ones already gone.
Happy 5th anniversary, Black Panther!<br>Released 02/16/2018!
Bozeman done all these movies while having cancer RIP Legend ❤

The fact that this 2 min Trailer is better then some 2 hours Marvel movies.Also , this is prove that the Song you choose has at least 50% influence and weight on the Trailer.The Songs represents everything, the Fight, the black struggle in society in the Marvel universe and the &quot;bow down&quot; in the Lyrics also refering the the King but at the Same time the Artist talking in His Lyrics wanting black people to Go big and wanting to See a black President, Just fits seeing wakanda coming Out and showing their true Power and the King showing the Power of the black  society with the black Panther costume and Power. This Trailer is Just on Point
Sti2d on est là
🔥🔥🔥
Legends watching in 2023 !!! 😁
Black panther 2018
Even wakandaforever was awesome
The movie was amazing
I don&#39;t know why the media keep targeting specific people and demonizing them, like when black panther attack the muslim terrorists who force women to wear hijab and then kill them all. The thing is, I don&#39;t know why the media never mension that the Nazis were Christians protestants and burned alive more than 4 million jews in WW2 and don&#39;t forget that there is no movie shows how the Christian schools killed and tortured the native Americans. Can you guys find another enemy because it&#39;s become so old. Is there a movie on the capital attack. I don&#39;t think so 🤔.
NTR kosam chusena vallu like kottandi
Wakanda mes frères !!! ALLEZ LES NOIRS !!!
Black panther show us how beautiful a culture is while it is fiction but it is an emotion🖤

one of the best mcu trailer and definetly one of the best mcu movie
to this day one of the best films of all time
Hero Legend King
Just another lousy movie! 😳
The person who mixed the music and beat for this trailer must have earned a huge raise cause it single handedly made countless people want to watch this movie.
Лучшеб эти чёрные снимали как рабами были и кто их угнетал, продавал, насиловал и истреблял и как сейчас идут дела в Африке.<br>Свои корни забыли, переобулись, а там их братья, сестры, сородичи по помойкам лазиют, пожрать что ищут, пухнут от голода и умирают, не не умирают, ДОХНУТ - так правильнее. Дохнут пачками.
Trailer doesn’t do the movie justice
I will Black panter you!!!!!
This movies is the greatest movie ever crafted
This still one of the greatest trailers eveeeer
One of the most epic trailers of all time. legend!!

REST IN PEACE MY FRIEND KING CHADWICK😭😭😭😭 i miss him

Black panther 2 should have been made earlier
always getting goosebumps to that beat playing as they enter wakanda
The King
There would never be other REAL King like Chadwick 👑🖤<br>I’ve watched Wakanda Forever today .. and made me cry the entire movie!! The pain of missing him is almost unbearable 🖤💙👑🖤
Black pantherHave a son he might be at the next Black Panther Black Panther 3
Baddest trailer that still gives me goosebumps.. that and infinity war 2nd trailer
5 years later and still the greatest marvel trailer
This is the sequel of wakanda forever: the return of king
Marvel just knows how to make good trailers
Woke-inda movie....oh god, just too much. Really?
Getting back at Black Panther after watching Wakanda Forever is just chilling. Seeing a rise of a king, who passed away too soon. Rest in peace❤
This trailer is so good lol
This film....I saw it multiple times in the theater. It gave me that nostalgic feeling when I saw The Last Dragon and Blade for very first time. Pride and representation. The fact Ryan put The Last Poets on the trailer..wow. Despite the final fight vs Kilmonger (that was horrible) this is a perfect film. For me at least
Don’t freeeze ,  <br><br>Chadwick - I NEVER FREEZE<br><br>RIP 🪦 KING
it&#39;s been 5 years.. this movie still amazing 🔥🔥🔥<br><br>Rest in peace King 😔❤️👑
Pin me
5 YEARS AGO AND I STILL HAVEN’T WATCHED THe FIRST ?
I never wanted shuri to be the black panther. I miss Chadwick!! They should have chosen someone else.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU&amp;t=56">0:56</a> The Skydiving scene is still Badass to this day.
after watching that Wakanda forever, I realize how much I liked the first black panther; they should have stopped after him gone.
Where it all started.
Gone are those days
Hard af
Never seen the trailer seeing it in 2022 makes me wanna it black panther 1 again
i remember i used to watch this trailer over and over again bcs it was a masterpiece???! now i watched this after black panther 2 and it makes me sad:’))
5years n still coming back to watch the trailer n still gives me the same chill when I first time watch it.
It’s almost 2023 and it has been 4 years since Chadwick’s passing the day he died I didn’t feel sad even tho I’m a marvel nerd but my brother did yesterday was his birthday and he was happy seeing wakanda forever the story is really good so we’re the character’s I cried when I saw the ending <br>R.I.P Chadwick wakanda forever🙅🏿🥹
I&#39;m from Chile, so I&#39;ll ask: a movie about black people IN AFRICA comes out and their song choice for both trailers is a rap/hip-hop kind of music... Isn&#39;t that a a little racist?
Forgot how good this movie was
chad wick full power
rip Chadwick
Any one else come back to watch this trailer for the nostalgia.😊
came back to watch this tralier for nostalgia after seeing Wakanda forever
you never freeze&gt;?
RIP Chadwick Boseman❤️

Who else misses Chadwick boseman more after watching wakanda forever
Came back here after watching &quot;Wakanda Forever&quot;. For me, Black Panther was more than just a film, it was a message, inspiration and motivation for all black people everywhere. R.I.P. Chadwick Boseman. You battled a terrible diesase but you had the strength to keep making movies, visit guests and children battling the same thing! You&#39;ll always be a King. Wakanda Forever!!!!
I stil watch this trailer in November 2022. Hands down one of the best trailer from Marvel.

For Chadwick Boseman !!!<br>-- From Black Panther : Wakanda Forever  2022--
I can&#39;t get enough of this trailer or the whole movie. Chadwick proved to us that sickness or disability or any form of ailment is not an excuse to stop pushing in life. this guy battled with cancer to creat this action filled master piece that will go on and on in the heart and mind of people. Wakanda may not be a real place but I hope one day someone or some people will name a place wakanda and you as it former King. Long live the King.dont worry death is just the starting to point to  another life bro.<br><br>R.I.P King of wakanda
My school was going on a field trip to the cinema and we were gonna watch black panther but a mother said no so now we need to watch some kiddy show called Lyle Lyle crocodile LIKE WTH
I have always been a huge Marvel fan, but this film had me mesmerized more than any other of their films. They got this one right! I will forever remember Chadwick as The King 👑 of Wakanda ! May this legend live in our hearts forever!<br>I’m excited to see Wakanda  Forever and see how they honor him in the upcoming film. What an extraordinary man, he did his best even through his illness. He wanted to complete his duty, and that makes him not only a Legend but a Hero as well!! 💔❤️<br>Never Forget!
Wakanda forever is a mockery of this movie
Is it just me or black folk movies always got the sickest soundtracks😅
My 5th favorite movie 🎥 of all time. I love it and Chadwick  Boseman  is and always will be the actor who broke barrier in that movie. Rest in Power My king. Wakanda Forever!!!!!!
This was and still will be the only black panther
Chadwick Boseman You&#39;ll Always Be The One And True Black Panther. Long Live The King 🤴
fockin legend
As he said  in my culture dead is not the end
I never freeze 🥶 🙅🏿‍♂️ 🐈‍⬛
It’s just so sad seeing this trailer after the legend has passed I’m so excited but sad at the same time for black panther wakanda forever to come out 😢 Chadwick will always be king👑😭
Won&#39;t watch a movie that dictates what a person can or can&#39;t wear to watch it!  Woke gatekeepers trying to dictate what people wear in a free country!  Disney should condemn it, but they won&#39;t!!!  Will not be seeing this for the reason of ..... &quot;dress code police&quot;.  Nobody is going to tell me what I can or can not wear to a movie in the free country of the USA!   Just creating greater division.
Rip 🙏 🕊 ☮️ 🪦 😌 ☹️ 🙏 🕊 ☮️ 🪦 😌 ☹️ 🙏 🕊 ☮️ 🪦 😌 ☹️ 🙏 🕊 ☮️ 🪦 😌 ☹️ 🙏 🕊 ☮️ 🪦 😌 ☹️ 🙏 I saw that movie

Agree or not but this is the most badass trailer in history of marvel
La mejor película del ucm🖤
This is better than the one for the new movie. Rip Marvel
Man! This movie had style! That&#39;s for sure.<br>In fact, it created a new style of its own.
Back to the first one...back to the original Leader..Black Panther ⚔️
Legend watching after “Wakanda Forever” trailer😢❤
putaoqueopariuuuuuuuu vai ser ducaraleooooooo o filme....
The first black character in 20 years to mean something to the culture. RIP.

Yooooo! This trailer SHITS all over the new one hahahaha. I’ll ask again, what’s the name of the song right after Ross asks “how much more ya hiding?”
WAKANDA FOREVER 🖤
This trailer explains more about the movie&#39;s story than the wakanda forever trailer
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU&amp;t=53">0:53</a>
RIP KING
Wow thought Submariner Namor was from Atlantis not from India just more woke garbage from the Disney Monopoly destroying iconic Marvel characters
top 5
RIP Wakanda King😭😪
Wakanda Forever will not surpass this movie for me. Sorry not sorry
Wow MCU does it again ruin an economic Marvel character Namor the Submariner....... the Disney Monopoly is a pure rip-off turning every Marvel character into a woke garbage !!!!!!!!!!!!!! The real creators of these characters people like Jack Kirby John romita. Neil Adams Marshall Rogers John Byrne.
Man, I remember exactly where I was when I started sobbing seeing this for the first time. I love my culture. Wakanda Forever. <br><br>Lets get ready for the heaviest marvel movie to date. I dont think were gonna get any of that funny we get from the first or other movies. I think its going to be heavy from top to bottom. almost 3 hours long and please everyone stay for the credits tribute. Dont get up and leave, ya only going to stand in the parking lot talking anyway.
Who is here on oct 3 after watching wakanda forever trailer🥹 RIP to the Legend

this trailer looks sick and dope cat wait to see black panther have his own film
Chad you were HONORED all over the world. Never forgotten. STILL AMAZING Trailer
Ops
Literally one of the best marvel trailers to this day. Rest In Peace Chadwick 🙏
“Mom, why do all the good and great people die early?<br><br>When you go into a garden, which flowers do you pick? The beautiful ones or the ugly ones?<br><br>The beautiful ones.”<br><br>Chadwick was like a beautiful rose among a field of weeds. This world can be so cold and horrible sometimes. You look around and things can be just terrifying and dark. Chadwick was a hero, both on screen and off screen. Rest in power, king T’Challa.
We wuz Kang.  RIP.
Black panther deserves more fans than iron man
RIP Chadwick Boseman 1976_2020 age 43

WAKANDA FOREVER, வகாண்டா வாழ்க😥🔥
Revisiting this trailer after the new BP 2 teaser trailer released. I must say whoever handles the BP trailers is a genius. Both are so so good. It&#39;s weird watching this and remembering how happy and excited I was to see the movie contrasted with the sadness I feel when I watched the Black Panther 2 teaser trailer. I hope they make Chadwick proud wherever he is. Wakanda Forever! 🙅🏾‍♂️
Interview gundogan
WAKANDA FOREVER🙅🏽‍♂️👑

3 Years later...&quot;Everything is gonna be alright&quot;...🥺🕊️🕊️.
2022👻👀
I came here after watching the Black Panther Wakanda for ever trailer, that trailer feels empty without him.
I&#39;m going to comment here because if I put it in the sequel trailer I&#39;ll probaby be crucified......................I&#39;m not feeling the Wakanda Forever trailer as much THIS ONE IMPACTED ME, I defined miss the presence both Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan give to this....they were the STARS of this film and without them....................just feel EMPTY, plus, this feel like a MOVIE TRAILER.....the sequel trailer feel like.....just something make for marketing and exploit Chadwick passing......I would rather have a new Tchalla than all the effort Chad put on THIS CHARACTER be loss, I feel that&#39;s need to keep alive and Chadwick probably would prefer if Tchalla live CONTINUES in the MCU.
miss you king &lt;3
This trailer slaps just as hard as the day it was released!  Also, Kilmonger is STILL the GOAT MCU villain!   RIP Chadwick!
The most iconic part of this trailer was Killmonger. Change my mind. RIP Chadwick though, although Black Panther wasn&#39;t necessarily my favourite part of the film, I did enjoy Chadwick&#39;s performance for what it&#39;s worth.
2022 and this trailer still hits different!<br>The music used 🤌
{.|.};;&gt;.&gt;&lt;
Even after your death, you&#39;re still inspiring us with all the incredible things you’ve done &amp; all the great things you’ve said. Thanks for being such an icon, King💜🖤
Rip king
Best Marvel Movie Ever ❤✌️
Here after the black Panther wakanda forever trailer Chadwick is truly missed he maybe gone but he is not forgotten long live the king T’Challa black Panther rip 😢

Show of hands who&#39;s here after seeing the Wakanda Forever trailer
Literally the best trailer I’ve ever seen, I always come back and watch it.
Too bad they couldn’t recast, doing injustice to the character in the name of respect, even though Chadwick would’ve wanted the character recasted himself
Rewatching after seeing bp2 trailer just to see chadwick

Sir you can alive black panther by like wax techniques...
when will bp 2 trailer come our
So that&#39;s Grim &amp; Death Reaper, Vampires and Zombies and Death for The Black Panther to beat Death take out all timeline options first if not may be very bad- this leaves the controlled timeline and the negative-zone. After you know where to put Death_ in the negative-zone. That&#39;s Analysis war and whatever left let them do away with the negative-zone;
The Revolution will not be televised. But it will still happen.
😘😘😘😘😘😘💜💚🇺🇸

I was scrolling the screen but it showed up. Literally I jumped off my bed saying &quot; What&quot; and at next moment i realized it was black panther 1 trailer
The film brings a vision of a world where African people are very technologically evolved. Because of that they are hiden from the world, so that there is no problem (with people trying to steal their technology) .  It is shown in the film that there is a tradition in which the king of Wakanda receives ancestral powers from a panther, and that this is how it is passed from generation to generation. The plot of the film is about an ex-wakandan who seeks revenge for his father against the country of Wakanda. The protagonist (the currently black panther) will have to defend his home and the rest of the world. Prejudice is also embroidery during the movie. The antagonist says it&#39;s hard to live outside Wkanda for those who are like him (black people) and at the end of the movie the protagonist helps the neighborhoods where black people live in the USA.  Particularly, the movie was very good, mainly because of the approach to racism and African tribes and traditions, which are not shown in many Marvel movies, but for sure the movie was one of the best in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) . <br>Vagner Vitor
Rewatching this trailer feels like a gut punch
Bagbak on background music is just lit!
Impeccable trailer. Audio choices were amazing. Chadwick remains king.
Jesus saves❤️✝️

Listen to the song playing lyrics, &quot;show me my respect, and bow down&quot;, &quot;we are not my homie, cause we own ya&quot;, yes that&#39;s pompous black supremacy and privilege that you&#39;re hearing. ✊🏾 the only privilege that exists is black privilege.
Afrocentric black supremacy! ✊🏾

&quot;Official trailer&quot; is the new term for &quot;recycled footage&quot;, huh?  Or maybe this is just fake.
The use of The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is incredibly ironic
Awesome trailer, watched it now.
racist movie, karma to all of you
King 👑
God is King ❤️

African Chosen One - King Uniter <br>The One - Maxim Ben David

Amazing to all! The movie, cast, music, and everything else about Black Panther! Wakanda Forever!<br>R.I.P. Chadwick Boseman. A marvellous king.
sometimes some messages are sent to us all predicting a future event like  Chadwick&#39;s death but we never get to know till it happens RIP to the KING. Wakanda forever
WAKANDA FOREVER
Thanks for this awesome movie! And may Chad Boseman eternally rest in the loving arms of our Almighty God! &lt;3
Long Live The King.
R.I.P black panther who is next black panther ? Marvel
Who’s still coming back to this in 2022?
<b>Only once you live, but legends never die.</b>
Can&#39;t believe king is gone 😥
In Black Panther 2 we need White Wolf
We waz kangz
I just watched 21 bridges last night and Chadwick did an awesome job in that movie. I haven&#39;t seen black panther yet but I&#39;m going to watch it soon.
funny how the gov eliminated the balck panthers activists
Wakanda Forever...rip Chadwick 🥀
racist movie
Wakanda Foreverrrr !!!
Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38
It is true “this never gets old”
🤢
A true hero on and off the screen
The next black panther role should be given to a white man so it&#39;s fair and not racist ( like the majority of blacks are ) I mean you guys cry and make white characters black, so i think it&#39;s time the black panther is a white guy. Thanks black ppl, don&#39;t cry too much.
By far the best trailer ever...
We wait for the sequel but it will be hard without you brother. Rest in Power King.
guess Juan
Black panthers are not allowed inside city limits.
This November, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever comes out. Not sure if I can handle the trailer when it comes out.
I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t see this in the theters Chadwick. I was just too hyped for infinity war during that time and I only cared about that but after I saw this movie I now regret seeing it in theters <br>Rip Chadwick
That&#39;s what your fighting for &quot;WAKA&quot; DUHHHHHH!!!! AHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAH
Legends never dia
miss u Chad!! ♡
Rest in peace king✊🏾
RIP Sir Chadwick, But One Message to Marvel from a True Fan.<br><br><br>Black Panther isn&#39;t Chadwick Boseman.<br>Black Panther is the person Who represents the message of Equality, protector of their Community, and a true Fighter. Be it Male of Female. And I&#39;d highly appreciate Marvel if they put in Shuri as our new Black Panther.<br><br>WAKANDA FOREVER ❤️
to the first and so far only superhero movie to get nominated for best picture
01100100 01110010
Black panter🤤🌚
Happy 4 year anniversary.
Best trailer in marvel
Legend never die .....
RIP Chadwick Boseman ❤️
Was he saying we own ya they control the internet
WAKANDA FOREVER
Overrated.
lol...just saw this POS movie, sucked deekly
I watched this movie in theatres in my favorite theater format - IMAX 3D!!!!!!!!<br>it was epic!!!!!
My forever king 👑
except no bunch of blacks could EVER hope to build a high tech society. Everybody shold have been running around haken holding sticks, that would have been more accurate.
Rip Chadwick world will remember you
&quot;Hero&quot; &quot;Legend&quot; &quot;King&quot;<br>Yes he was. Rest in peace, Chadwick Boseman.
The best trailer ever.
legit when I have a bad day, I come watch this trailer, listen to the soundstrack and watch the movie &lt;3
This was one of marvels highest grossing film
No offense but Black Panther woulda been better with Wesley Snipes and Denzel had it came out early 2000s
&lt;3
still hand out the best &amp; most built up trailer i have ever seen
I ❤ this movie.
Legend Pls come  back
:( wakanda forever
Please send me link to trailer music
black panther appearances in mcu .     captain America civil war :  black panther :   avengers infinity war.   avengers endgame :
Rip Chadwick Boseman he was a good actor 🙏🥺
Respect to ta challa , aka Chadwick boseman
shame he couldve been the leader of the mcu goodbye chadwick
White Tiger doesn&#39;t have an MCU yet, it&#39;s still comic and in animation
Legends never die
WAKANDA FOREVER!
Massively overrated movie. Chadwick Boseman was a good actor but this movie was mediocre at best and was only bigged up due to the politics behind it, not because it was a great movie.
I have to admit I am spidey fan but this is the coolest hero in MCU. Rest in peace Chadwick 🙏
In black panther 2, We want legendary tribute to chadwick boseman...
Is legend and king and hero this power Chadwick bossman
Rip to the king
Except for the infinity war trailer I think this is the best one they ever made
this video deserves a lot more than likes 👍🥳💥🤩😂♥
Still idiotic.
Wakanda Forever
I&#39;ve never scene anything like this. This line is dope
repent for all of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
He was the best man ever rip my one in only king wakanda forever
We miss you Chadwick Boseman as an actor who played Black Panther.
Bring a tear to my eye still one my favourite films rip King Chadwick gone but never forgotten

im crying! whos crying with me
I watch this movie over and over again.
Rip
Black Panther really was a terrible movie almost as bad as Suicide Squad. But for the safety of me and my family I think it was best movie in cinema history.
We miss you King T&#39;Challa, RIP 👑 Wakanda forever🙏🏾
Best Marvel trailer <br>btw RIP Chadwick 😞❤️🕊
R.I.P Chadwick Boseman you are amazing
So watched the movie and here again
R.I.P. Chadwick
I never watched the trailer I just heard of it and watched it in theaters
Jai shree ram 🙏🙏
Welcome to Wakanda, the most technologically and intellectually advanced society in the world. We choose our leaders through dynastic inheritance and physical brawls. THAT&#39;s how advanced we are!<br>The fact that Killmonger wants to help people in Los Angeles and not the Congo is very telling as to the motivation of the creators
I wish blackpanther is alive 😭
Wakanda forever
I am still so sad about Chadwick&#39;s passing. What a loss.
What this song
Негры радуйтесь тому, если вами русский спецназ не занелся! Негры вам был просто конец и ужасный! А ваши американцы США в армии это никто! Где ваш спецназ США! Сдохли перед преступниками! Сват США ну работать! Применение любого вооружения! Сват США давай работай! Уничтожай преступность США!
4 years later I came back to this trailer again, RIP MY KING
Rip black panther
Chadwick Boseman could be on a wheelchair and still do stunts. R.I.P Chadwick Boseman
Aquaman is caterpillar to this panther🔥🔥🔥
Still the dopest one and will be forever.
Treiler music name?
RIP LEGEND 😢
Best trailer ever made 🖤💫
❤️
wakanda forever 🔥
Still epic in 2021 ♥️
Anybody else here wondering how in the world thousands of people gave this a thumbs down. SMH....WHAT???!!!???!!!
``IN OUR CULTURE DEATH IS NOT THE END`` -T`CHALLA
A great movie
To chadwick boseman ❤
miss you chad
🖤🌸
RIP Chadwick Boseman
Marvel Studios Black Panther is just like Iron Man. Both are so perfectly casted that they feel like they exist in real life
Chadwick Bosemen
This movie was the biggest load of shite I’ve seen in years.
If t&#39;challa had ANY honor he would have yielded to N&#39;Jadaka, Then we&#39;d have an interesting and socially relevant canvas for future stories and character arc. T&#39;challa is a bougie coward and a petty murderer of family members, just like his father. They QUICK to sacrifice ALL those thousands of years of secrecy to save the WHITE spook tho, hm... Someone needs to rewrite Black Panther. It was obviously written by Nazis.<br><br> Spoiler alert: The embodiment of Black anger, hope, and solidarity is stabbed in the heart to maintain the status quo.<br><br> Long live N&#39;Jadaka! The only Black Panther for me. What an important fuckin character.
they will always be poor, hungry, and undeveloped.
The Real Legend❤🥺
revolution will not be televised????? wtf
Highly Over-Rated and Over-Hyped<br>I literally was feeling sleepy just half way through the movie. I might not be a good critic on someone&#39;s acting, but the people who acted in this film seemed pretty dull. The characters were very simple and predictable , exceptions only Andy Serkis &amp; Micheal B. Jordan. T&#39;challa&#39;s sister was a bit interesting. So she might be an exception too.<br>But other than that, the film felt too dragged.
Stumbled back here to see how amazing this trailer and film are.<br>As if wanting to be in 2018.
R.I.P King..
Who thought
if its  not michael b jordan then they shouldnt do another sequel lets not spoil the best marvel movie
Honestly The Best Trailer of MCU
I just watched through the marvel movies and can&#39;t get over how racist this movie is. Marvel should be ashamed of themselves. Boseman was a good actor and but the movie could have been so much better.
A very racist movie. What happened to blind casting promoted by Marvel/Disney? Why there is no white people in Wakanda? Even in Nordic kingdom of Asgard there were cast black actors Heimdall, Valkyrie, etc…..
the song fits awesome insanely well when he throws those ball thingys
Not in movies but chandwick boseman is really a king
everywhere i go i see his face miss you king
Wakanda Forever
Most overrated movie of all time. 3 Oscars? Give me a break bruh...
Rip Chadwick
Wakanda for ever
&quot;In my culture death is not the end&quot; Rest in peace king 🖤🥺
I just click on this video seeing late Chadwick boseman as black panther without looking the full title and date of uplode i thought it is black panther 2 trailer but at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU&amp;t=65">1:05</a> i realised my mistake but i watch full trailer and enjoyed it like movie
I’ve never seen this trailer at all
It’s so bittersweet to watch this now. 🥲
« The Revolution will not be televised » in a Hollywood movie trailer...
R.I.P Our Legend, Our Inspiration Chadwick Boseman
النمر الأسود
We All Miss Black Panther
still the best trailer all of time
i miss the actor he was so good at acting t-challa : i never freeze
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU&amp;t=68">1:08</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU&amp;t=71">1:11</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU&amp;t=74">1:14</a> the three words that describe Chadwick. RIP🖤
good movie, but overrated
Wakanda Forever ❤️
Just one word for this trailer, <br><br>BAADASS
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU&amp;t=112">1:52</a> &quot; wakanda forever &quot; tears in my eyes 😢

R.I.P Chadwick your a true king
we are family :)<br>but.....<br>you have to earn my respect 😇🔱😈<br><br>ps : ye own...no one ...but yer own soul  😇🔱<br>but if ye say otherwise....there is no difference between ye and them 😈🔱
Man, his run in MCU was too short lived
i remember being so young and exited for this film. rip chad you were and are a true inspiration.
We miss you! 😭♥️
🖤🖤🖤
Rip
I was almost crying when I found out he died 😔😭☹️😔😄☹️😔☹️😭
The Legends Never Die<br>He Lived In Our Thought<br>     Rest In Peace Sir<br>           Miss You
Even if he is gone he was not only a king but a legend ✊👑
Rip Chadwick
token and cartman
Can we all agree that this movie has the best soundtrack of all MCU?
I&#39;ve only heavily cried for Aaliyah, Left-eye, MJ, Whitney, and Chadwick. I cried the most for Chadwick since I was old enough to remember his entire career from when I was in middle school until now.
I miss the hype this movie had.  Can&#39;t believe just 3 years ago it feels like nostalgia now. I was done with 2020 when Chad passed. Just couldn&#39;t process it, but I&#39;m glad he was given his flowers while he was living. I miss his voice, presence, spirit, wisdom, and talent. So much I could say about what I loved and admired about him.... Thank you for leading by example and persevering! Continue to rest in heaven king!
Just came here check the legend...RIP KING
This will forever remain legendary.
1 year completed her death
I got This recommended to me ☹️
🙅🏾‍♂️🐆
1 year since Chadwick’s passing. RIP King T’Challa. Wakanda Forever!
This is the BEST movie trailer i have watched so far.....
Today marks His one year’s death. May his soul rest in the heavens. We miss you, King.
Our community stands up strong with the great Chadwick Boseman
the feeling of watching black panther for the first time in the theatres was unparalleled
1000000%<br>Awsome masterpiece
Rest in power my king
the music in this trailer is a bop
RIP Chadwick Boseman<br>Wakanda Forever!
Most amazing movie from marvel ever made! We love you! You will be remembered forever! Wakanda Forever!
rip black panther
No one can take his place as BLACK PANTHER.
Wakanda Forever
How to make black panther<br><br>Step 1: make him a superhero<br>Step 2: based on him with West and South African culture<br>Step 3: give him Purple powers<br>Step 4: Make a costume that inspired by a black panther animal<br><br>Finished!! now you have Black Panther.
Chadwick Bosen a few years later: ight imma die now
I can&#39;t lie, I think the actual movie is overrated. Not bad, but hyped up too much. But this <b>trailer</b> tho 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 RIP Chadwick
RIP
Legends never die
There should be a part 2 of black panther
This has to be my favorite MCU trailer, watching it gives me chills to this day
Chadwick Boseman♥️
Who came after what if episode 2
I had to watch it for a second time last night before playing as him in the avengers game today
R.I.P Chadwick Boseman...WAKANDA FOREVER!!! <br>Long live the King!!!<br>We miss you 3000.
🖤
THE BLACK PANTHER
Glory to Hanuman🔥🙏🔥🖤
I really like the casts and the settings in Wakanda of the 1st Black Panther film, reminding me of how Africa would look like in the future as a prediction to be inspired by the superhero in the Marvel Comics for sure.
RIP , the king of wakanda
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU&amp;t=47">0:47</a> ENCHANTMENT TABLE  LANGUAGE IN THE BACK hes not just the king of wakanda hes the king of mc :O i wish he was alive to still be the king tho rip :(

The most badass trailer ever
My name is Madison Fitzpatrick and I am an intern at EUE/Screen Gems studios in Atlanta. I am currently making a documentary about the history of EUE/Screen Gems. The movie “Black Panther&quot; was filmed on our lot so I wanted to include it in the documentary. I was wondering if I had your permission to use 2 seconds of this video that you posted on Youtube in my documentary. <br><br>Thank you for your time, <br><br>Madison Fitzpatrick
Woooo
It&#39;s weird but came here after &quot;Succession Season 3 tease&quot; where Kendall Roy screams &quot;The revolution will be televised&quot;
Black Panther is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in Fantastic Four #52 (cover-dated July 1966) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Black Panther&#39;s real name is T&#39;Challa, and he is depicted as the king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T&#39;Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.
Rip Chadwick bose man 😭😭😭😭😭
The panthers plagiarized my words after I said &quot;Panthers and Leopards get no room at Mekonen University.&quot; Way below academic misconduct ,it is laymanic misconduct.
Chadwick - The only super hero who died after the very first super hero movie ? - &quot;HHHHHMMMMM&quot; 🤔
My question is what are those ha I love her
Can we all just packing it up and go home 😂
Bro why did chadwick have to die man 😭
We can break it and sell it on eBay 😂
Hey is this yours who are you bro who do you think Duh I’m Superman 😂 nah sicke
victory of black fascism!.
R.I.P chadwick💔🕊
Spoiler<br>This Movie Is Next Level.Worth Watching..
The revolution will not be televised. It will be only on cinemas and Disney+.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rip Chadwick boseman<br>Our king will kill Batman
Horse manure of a movie.
Music matching with trailer is at highest level
How are they gonna make the next black panther without Chadwick?
The best Marvel trailer ever, I still come back and watch it.
2021 and we&#39;re still here. Still reeling from the death of a hero that gave light to so many kids that felt they were in the dark. Wakanda forever? Yeh but I feel it&#39;s more fitting to be... Boseman forever!
Your in a better place my king
As you can see I am Not dead!...... &lt;3
missing black panther 😭😭😭😭
He is Really Hero, Legend, King 🔥
&quot;The revolution will not be televised&quot;. Perfect track for this
Looks like another bullshit show.
Music is soul of the movie.❤️❤️
Movie was not so good, Basically a rip off &#39;The dark knight rises&#39;...with some cool CGI though.
Everything is cool, except part where they fight with swords and claws with all this technical advancements
He actually died like a true king. <br>Didn&#39;t give people the time to show pity towards him in his final days. <br>Left a legendary legacy. 🤍<br>R.I.P King Boseman.
R.I.P. Chadwick Boseman. One of the greatest actors of all time.
What a legend R.I.P King
what&#39;s the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU&amp;t=128">2:08</a>
rip chadwick boseman
Best Marvel movie i&#39;ve ever seen. Rip Chadwick Boseman, Wakanda Forever!!!
&quot;the revolution will not be televised, the revolution will be live&quot;
If you shave a panther&#39;s fur it&#39;s skin is white😂
who here just watching the trailer because its so cool?
I noticed something in the end: The reveal of the word Black Panther, there are scars on the letters, foreshadowing Killmonger&#39;s scars
RIP Chadwick
How&#39;s that for a Questionnaire?
I swear warner Bros better put some Cumbia music when the blue beetle trailer comes out
Does anyone know the soundtrack?
the legend never die !
this trailer still gives me the goosebumps... you will be in our hearts forever
🧢
This is still one of the best trailers I&#39;ve ever seen.
Wakanda Forever!! RIP Chadwick, we miss you!
WAKANDA FOREVER 🙅
WAKANDA FOREVER
Masterpiece
RIP Chadwick Boseman❣️
Canggih bener negeri Wakanda, tapi kali ini Michael B. Jordan jadi antagonis-nya
Watching Again , May 2021
My black kitty is gone 😭
What a waste. Sure there are other talented actors but Chadwick&#39;s Black Panther was flawless.
Overated AF
We miss you 😢 Chadwick Bozeman 😥😥🥺🥺🥺😓😓 You were a good man
Any one know the song

Screw you i thought this was Black Panther 2.
Legend rest easy 👑
The King
This movie and Infinity War are over 3 years old, dang times flies by real quick. Thank god for this movie and Infinity War or else Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom would have been the number one highest grossing movie of 2018. Thank you Marvel, Thank you.
WAKANDA FOREVER🙅🏿‍♂️
RIP<br>CHADWICK<br>BOSEMAN<br>😭
Wakanda forever
Wakanda forever ❤️

am i  the only one who watched the trailer after watching the movie?
Looks like blacks finally got their black supremacy movie. With a little help from Hollywood of course.<br>By the way; do they use that disgusting accent in the whole movie?
Who’s excited for the sequel Black Panther: Wakanda Forever?
2021
What can I say...  Just Mind-blowing !
BLACK PANTHER LIVES MATTER
ONE NAME GOT EVERYTHING
YouTube recommendationa rocks
This trailer was more entertaining than the whole movie, not to discredit the movie, but the trailer is just that good.
