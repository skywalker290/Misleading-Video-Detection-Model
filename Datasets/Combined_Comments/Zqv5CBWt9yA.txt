Safar❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
While I was listening to this song in bus ....on my way to my academy .... I was feeling sleepy.....and then out of nowhere there was this kid(around 11 years old) crossing the road and he struck my hand while the bus was passing by him ....i came back from my sleep to see him .....behind the bus , crossing the road ....looking back at me waving his hand and smiling.....something which i didn&#39;t expect💫 ....<br><br>I dont know but this scene very much resonates the lyrics of this song.....so I thought to comment this incident right away...<br><br>Very coincidental yet wholesome ❤️

I guess the moto of this beautiful song is been inspired from the poem &quot;The road not taken&quot; by Robert Frost.
भुवन भावा खूप जबरदस्त song आहे मी आज ऐकलं आणि माझ्या tour ची सुरवात करत आहे म्हणजे केली पण 190 km झालं आज ते पण Left घेऊन , love u तुझ्या भावा कडून अजून खूप पुढे जा  जय शिवराय
