Conor should NOT have lived through the 3rd round. My God.
Nate was like wtf. Bro you got knocked down 2-3 times 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=158">2:38</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=170">2:50</a>
conor better with hands u think? or punshing bag is better?
I think real zombie is nate.....omg
the fact a professional mma fight is classed as a “rematch scene” really shows how good of a performance this was by both fighters. this match is being seen as something you’d see in a movie. incredible.
Bias highlights
This a movie ???
Husband and wife
This is crazy, but in my opinion this is art 🥹
Nate diaz the father of the face of the fight game
SURPRISE MTHERFCKING A KING IS BACK🥶
conors damn lucky that time ran out.
Hell of a chin McGregor
Imagine McGregor with Nate’s stamina
I really think this is Conor’s best what we saw here…he was composed, calm, had the skill and speed.
CM star👊👊👊
I watch it everyday
This was a great fight but lawler vs macdonald 2 is way better
Corner is only good at trashtalking
Nate needed 10 more sec
This is the best fight ever 😂😂😂...
Nate would definitely be a spear hunter in tribal society. Dude would chase his prey till it collapses from exhaustion.
Nate vs Conor 1 and 2 was such a time to watch UFC. And also Conor vs Khabib as well.
featherweight to lightweight take bow connor ❤
Its inly buisiness lol😂
Cornor was so good at 170lbs
Шедевр и сам бой ,и то ,как смонтировали это видео - пересматриваю бывает раз в месяц - постоянно идут нереальные эмоции <br>Лучший бой
Nate was the true winner
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=172">2:52</a> is soooooo badass
Conors very long uppercut is crazy.
They went nuts <br>This fight was crazy
Nate is incredible he can take a beating and still be dangerous
Bro I&#39;m not huge conor fans. And i watch so many times. I still can&#39;t get it why ppls say nate won. Conor mostly dominate whole fight. Nate only win last minutes round 3 and 5 . 1st definitely Conor. 2nd conor. 3rd nate win last minute round. 4th conor. 5nate.
Respect nate
Why only show gregor&#39;s points..In this match nate beats gregor.
Call khabib the eagle🦅🦅
Yeah after watching this.. that kid Paul he&#39;s fighting not standing a chance.
nate should have won the second fight but he let the money get to him
Whats the musical theme in the backround called?
Nate is bad but in a good way
A Mexican and an Irish man
A real dog fight
Nate is like Tryndamere
When they both hit eachother at the same time &gt;&gt;&gt;
Surprise surprise moda foca da keng is bac
Diaz really won.
Its likr nate doesn&#39;t even feel amy pain after each round
This was the fight that made me fall in love with the UFC man
I know nothing about fighting or MMA. Other than what is obvious : McGregor has inferior cardio, compared to many of his contemporaries.
Actually the legend iss Nate Diaz mark my words NAKED PAIN WFT MAN HOW. CAN HE STAND ON. HIS FEET.
Nate got ROBBED!
This is real movie?
Nate is a REAL legend cuz he ate so many punches and was still standing
Conor le conectaba muchisimo mas fuerte los golpes de nate diaz es como una niña
After all that shir talk Nate still helps Conor up at the end, true sportsmanship by both men during this fight
Did he basically do a Muhammad Ali? Only with out the dodging?😅😅😅 took took all the shots in the beginning on the head like wtf
Song at the end?
Awesome can’t wait for the sequel where I’m sure it’ll be better than the first!
Movie Diaz imparable corazón de hierro sangre latina
Make an update on his career now🤣
net 2 much wise ting time
What fithg!!!🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Who is the winner? I thought Diaz finished by technical knockout.
NATE THE REAL OG
Conner who?
Surprise surprise mother f*k** the king is back
Grande el mas grande Mc Gregor 🤙🏼☝🏽☝🏽❤🔥
The best en most entertaining fight of all time
The face and the looks on Conor McGregor face when John Kavanagh said &quot;5 minutes for the best fight of your life ,, is funny 🤣 asf
Biggest fight in mma history?
Nick foi roubado
That &quot;Thanks for the fight&quot; said by Connor to Diaz after such a fookin crazy brawl... Goosebumps.
Congratulations Conir McGregor
Still waiting for 3rd
Great Lucky For Blood Out Cover Show 😎
Nice shoot
2 Back Cover The Blood ,,
nate is a beast .... you just can&quot;t ignore that he is one of the greatest fighters in ufc , i have a great respect for nate , like him or dont he is the badass of stocton california
Love this scene. They didn&#39;t do Nate dirty. The editing made Nate Diaz seems like the terminator that keeps coming back after getting hit, rightfully so. Respect to both men for fighting their hearts out
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=217">3:37</a> damn move👌👌
You didn&#39;t win. He beat you twice and you no it. And anyone who watched it nose. Puss
Chozen,robby and Miguel then we solo every one
I’m the beginning oh this video when they all Jump the old man hits the women with a red dress .. why 😭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=9">0:09</a> is no one gonna talk about the dude elbowing the chick lmaoo
Poor nate
Rogan, shut the    up.
reaaaaaal interesting🔥💥
Nice
I felt like I was watching a movie 🍿
Surprise surprise mf the king is back 🔥🔥
I am A huge Khabib Fan But We can&#39;t deny Conor McGregor is a Very talented and Hard working Fighter .
nate won
2 more minutes and Diaz had it again.
Nate&#39;s got Heart of Steel!
You are not a king. I only see two clowns. he doesnt know what will coming to him. 😁
Nate diaz wins
If the khabib fight would have happen after this, it would have been way better
Nates terminator end of story how can any human being take that to the face and still stand love him and Nick
The fight was a tie the first four rounds. According to the point system he actually want to fight with that takedown in the 5th
Conor has been a first round killer <br>2nd and 3rd round he clearly lost and took a beating from Nate<br>But from 4th round he was back at it <br>This is what he should be remembered for <br>GOAT
A short circuit in his brain made him unable to be knocked out. The only one who can defeat him is the doctor, or he will fight until he dies in the ring.
Best fight in mma❤
Nate Diaz is the man
That&#39;s the last time conor won a fight.
Fixed
Diaz outstruck conor but conor had the knockdowns and just overall has a cleaner style that favors the judges . I give the slight nod to conor. -Diaz fan
I miss this mcgregor so much 😭
really was an awesome fight for the ages
One of the greatest rivalry in ufc history
fake
Who is here after Diaz Win😤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=284">04:44</a> nate didnt like the decision 😅
Diaz marque vite mais un très bon encaisser
Nate biaz a plus rien a prouver a personne très bon combattant mais le roi de la catégorie et conor il reste juste le meilleur combattant ufc et sa depuis déjà plusieurs années ces une légende de l&#39;ufc je pense con peu lui tirer le chapeau a se messieurs conor
Stupid music
corno fake mcgregor, maior mentira que o ufc já produziu
Ate I Ate Hindi and ko on and off I for the sure was I was that
John 17:15<br>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.
Khabib Nurmagomedov is the best 29:0 He won Conor, Getjea, Porye and other good fighters
you know whats gonna be the best UFC trilogy - fight - moment &gt; NateConor3
PiNBY DES. ON CONOR. <br>5 <br>Leonardo PERUCHI <br>Piracicaba

Much respect to both of these guys 👍👍😎😎
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=280">4:40</a>  did he say &quot;the winner by notorious decision?&quot;
This is UFC Rare Fight 💪👑👊👊 wtf khabib batter go to WWE 😀 you  are not fit 4 UFC  👊 wat a shaame
In this moment, its not a scene. Its a history.
Dana is still mad about that fight ….damn
I like to see how Connor fight ,his accuracy and perfect striking skills suit him perfectly
One thing I can say about Diaz, he never switched up.
that blood is true man♥️
When did this become so big that people put them in “movie clips”
Great diaz
Nate got rob from this fight
nice
We need Conor vs Nate 3!
Natě Diaz 👋🏽🔥
amazing 💯🩸
nate can take alot alot of blows
C&#39;est triste. Pas beau c&#39;est pas normal. 🤪😔
That was a Sick Fight
Awsome fight
nate is the man
The only 2 fighters in mma that i love
Nate Not bad for a , as mcgregor called him,  a &quot;small framed , injured gazelle&quot; Scraped by with a win but only just Conner , only just.
Diaz vs khamzat gonna end the same as Nate vs Connor heard it here first
conor was lowkey saved by the bell
Amazing fighting 💪💪
This is the most notorious moment in UFC the finale of best of best of what UFC could’ve ever offered to fans
Conor could&#39;ve been something great, all because he let floyd win get to him and having bunch of yes man in his corner.
really close fight
After Nate Conor 2 <br>The UFC handed Conor everything <br><br>Nate tapped Conor first<br><br>Khabib first UFC opponent Nick Diaz KOd him in 2006<br>Nate started 9-1 all finishes against much better competition than Khabibs first 18 fights
Conor mostrou sua capacidade, merece respeito, nike dias é um cara dificil na queda..
That is two warriors man the will to not want to get beat. these guys both have it
Just awesome to see they respected each other’s effort . Both great fighters and they both know it. Def go down as one of the best UFC fights Nate and Conor 1 and 2
Another special moment shared by two awesome  warriors
Damn they both was going at it
How did the judges give this fight to Connor is still shocking 🥹🥹
Uno de mis peleadores favoritos, habló de Nate. Lo demás es kk.
The difference? M.G trained his nuts off for this only the opposite of the first.

Conor McGregor: Notorious  LMFAO LOLOLOLOLOL
I swear Nate won that fight.
nate you are the king
Things just got &quot;reeeeeeeeeeea-natesmyfriend-aaaaaaaaal&quot; interesting.
Deadliest fight in the history of UFC. How can people hate Conor he is a warrior. Nate was like he is built different
Me at the end of the clip:😱🤗 Finally found the original sound of the &quot;surprise, surprise MF the king is back&quot;
Dftghhhjjj
Conor forever
Nate won that fight<br>End of debate
Conor wouldn&#39;t be nothing without this fight if wasn&#39;t for Diaz
Ngl was all about Diaz winning again after that come back of his
Damn Mcgregor&#39;s combos and counters looked beautiful in those first two rounds
The way Nate lifts Connor after this utter madness and bloodbath it&#39;s just pure class... Not sure how Nate survived such massacre and then He almost finished Connor...<br>This fight should have been a draw... Just 2 warriors not giving up but shakes hands like true sports man after this blood exchange 🤜🤛
Conor&#39;s power isn&#39;t as great as people make it out to be. Especially since moving up to LW and WW.
What a fight man what a fight
Where is the King now
Nate type of guy when he hurt more he love taste blood
❤😊💪
nate is luffi from one pice
No grappling no wrestling just stand up fight.
This was very entertaining but man if you aren&#39;t gonna grapple then throw some kicks.  Otherwise you&#39;re just playing &quot;face to face&quot; for an hour
One more round and it would have been nate all the way: Every Nate Diaz fight
I remember watching this live in the summer of 2016. Fresh out of senior school. Good times.
Nate in street fight he win all his fight
Nate win this rematch , Conor run baby run baby run baby run ...
5000
Diaz has heart like no other!!
Excellent editing that, Kudos.
I don&#39;t know how these guys can take all those punishing blows.  Should they even be
They did ... Unbelievable from both sides . REAL
Fighting one of the Diaz brothers is like a war of attrition. They just keep coming at you, hitting you relentlessly.
Hope Connor leaves the octagon at his comeback fight on two legs at least
Diaz is a deadly Souls boss
This fight had me on the edge of my seat
Two Warriors
REPENT TO GOD LORD JESUS CHRIST GOD LOVES YOU<br>REPENT TO GOD LORD JESUS CHRIST GOD LOVES YOU<br>REPENT TO GOD LORD JESUS CHRIST GOD LOVES YOU<br>REPENT TO GOD LORD JESUS CHRIST GOD LOVES YOU<br>REPENT TO GOD LORD JESUS CHRIST GOD LOVES YOU<br>REPENT TO GOD LORD JESUS CHRIST GOD LOVES YOU<br>REPENT TO GOD LORD JESUS CHRIST GOD LOVES YOU
Either people are blind or stupid that are commenting saying that Nate Diaz won the second fight, he did put up a really good fight but McGregor controled the fight a lot more. He dropped Diaz five times and Diaz&#39;s face was a busted bloody mess McGregor didn&#39;t have one scratch on him I know the fight isn&#39;t judged based on damage but I think it should be and because Diaz landed just a few more punches more than McGregor did, that makes everybody think that Diaz won LOL. I always liked the Diaz brothers and they&#39;re both great fighters and are as tough as they come but the both of them always seemed to have a problem with really strong, athletic and quicker fighters
Gregor has a bit more horse power but doesn&#39;t have the same amount of gas in the tank as nate.
Habib 💪🏻
Uno dei più grandi combattimenti di sempre!
I used to be one-sided about these two fighters, but now I just have mad respect for both of them, they will definitely be remembered
I CAN NOT BELIEVE THEY EVEN GAVE NATE POINTS LOOK AT DUDES FACE I MEAN TF ...AND I THINK THIS IS THE FIGHT IM REMEMBER NOT NATE BEATING HIM LIKE THIS.....OR RETIRED MAN..... JUST SO HE DONT GOT GO AGAIN AND LOSE .....SAVING FACE KIHAB OR W/E I DONT RESPECT DUDE ENOUGH TO EVEN LEAR HIS NAME...HE HAD TO PN HIM CTFU HE KNEW HE HAD NO HANDS LMAO ......... THIS WAS A MAN BEATING A DOG ....
LOOK AT NATES FACE LIKE MAN I CANT LOSE WAIT I JUST DID CAUSE HE FIGURED MY STYLE OUT AND DID NOT DO THE SAME MISTAKES DERRR THIS MAN CONOR HAS BEAT SO MANY PEOPLE WHEN HE GETS BEATS PEOPLE JUST GOT GO AFTER HIM BUT WHEN HE WINS EVERYONE IS HATING SO MANY LOSERS YOU COULD NOT FIGHT YOU ARE A SHAME ....I MEAN I BENCHED 400 I KNOW WHAT WORK IS AND ANYONE WHO HAS DONE THIS KNOWS SMH.....
Gregor did not deserve to win.
If they ever do make a movie about Conor Mcgregor, he should be played by Tom Hardy and Nate Diaz should be played by Jon Bernthal. Better than casting Jared Leto no offense
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=290">4:50</a> LEGENDARY ✨
@Once Believer:..John 14:6 “I am the way to the truth and the life. The only way to the father is through me”✝️- Jesus Christ❤🙏..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=291">4:51</a> 💯
The movie absolutely failed by glossing over the Alvarez dismantling for Conor to become 2 weight world champion. What a bizarre move relegating that to a quick summary when that was essentially the bookend to Conor&#39;s entire journey of dreams and motivation.
Conner is changing weight class...to hold belts in 3 different divisions...he can do it...speed is on his side...
Nate looks like a thug...Conner looks  like Mr. Cocky...both are great fighters...but Conners speed and accuracy is on another level...pound for pound he is the best ...mainly because his mentality is vicious ...
This Connor would destroy Khabib
SUPRIZE SUPRIZE MOTHERFUCKERS THE KING IS BACK
Just wow. Thankful for these two warriors. And what an amazing edit 🔥
&amp; they left it in the octagon…. Love to see it
Diaz look like he got hit by a truck
i swear nate has the most health points
Awesome video, a even better fight
Some people say this has to be draw 🤦‍♂️ Conor gave him clean shots
Conor is the real fighter who can fight with every weight not like khapip
They are like Rocky and Apollo <br>Mcgregor is flashy and prideful like Apollo<br>Diaz can take the worst beating you’ve ever seen and still come up Winning like Rocky <br>Haha
Conor won fair, but dam he was running 😂
Amazing
I never seen two dudes that can handle so much dmgs, I am not a UFC fan but this fight was the best I have ever seen, and I love those two, especially Nate who is funny to watch, he makes me think the dude with the baseball bat in One punch man, he becomes stronger when he gets dmgs

Conor work on stamina plz
how they gave the win to McGregor ? Nate Diaz whooped his behind
Last time Conner fought like he really needed it
The only way to win against Dana&#39;s boy is to make sure you finish him. Nate won this fight
I&#39;m sorry but no way in hell did nate Diaz lose this fight.
Nate is monster 🔥🔥🔥
Best fight ever…2 warrior’s
Ah, mcgregor. The casual&#39;s champ.
Nate&#39;s greatest talent was the beating he could withstand. His striking is actually very bad, as witnessed on this video he slap punches, but damn the man can take a punch. Guts. Great fight. Miss this UFC
The fight of Nate soo nice and good. I think Nate winner in this match.
Diaz world
Funny, I watched this fight a million times, Diaz won every time. Cut the film all you want, Diaz won, hands down.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=11">0:11</a> look at it closely … guy in suite elbows lady in red dress in the guy 😂😂😂
Conor ❤️❤️
The Best UFC Match ever ✍️✍️
Couldn&#39;t ko Diaz though.....
Props to Conor for giving Nate that big payout, dude was damn near broke, win or lose Conor is the real hero here.
Nate is AN android from DRAGON BALL Z
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=11">0:11</a> old man elbows blonde in vajeen
Nah this fight was peak. They both got absolutely hammered and I love it
Conor literally dranked Diaz blood
Diaz ❤️
Nate Díaz you are a mother******💪🏽

Nate🔥
Respect of men in a fighting sport.
I have a new respect for nate
good sportsmanship
And they say nate won that fight lol
Nate&#39;s like a zombie what the hell he just keeps standing
Nate won that fight in my opinion
And Nate was challenging khabib lol🤣🤣🤣🤣
How this is legal is beyond  me
Is kick allowed?<br>Idk about this stuff😌😌
Nate diaz é raçudo!!!!
I hate this
best commentry ever
Did Connor say &quot;you&#39;re a natural warrior&quot; to Nate?... if so damn thats awesome
I want to know everything the diaz brothers ate or took since they were kids
Nate Diaz No:1
Tell the guy who follows the devil
I&#39;m I&#39;m gonna go to hell U better give me a match
I got to Joe Rogan saying &quot;REEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL INTERESTING! Turned the video off straight away... Clown
Robbery
&quot;the king is back&quot;? More like he was on his back getting beaten.
The way how diaz helped to get connor up at the end.. respect
Mcgreggor vs Diaz 3.<br>Do it soon.<br>I’m getting old and loosing interest fast.
3?
When diaz is seeing Blood is finish
bro diaz tanked those heavy punches for real man. Incredible
CONOR TU ES BEAU JE T&#39;AIME
Respect 💯
diaz better
I know this is not the full match, but only looking at this video it looks like diaz actually made many more points than mcgregor did
Diaz is like playing darth vaders abilty in battlefront two
Big Up to my man Nate 💪 You a winner in my book .
If it&#39;s a 10 round fight Nate won
Rock chin Nate
Dude how can people respect McGregor after he ran away in the end of the fight
This was a warrior&#39;s performance from both of them.
Legend
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=10">0:10</a> any one watch
Nate omg 😆 papi 😍😘🥰
100 percent Diaz won that fight
I love Conor but they cut the parts where Conor literally ran away from Nate
Nate won that fight and a few more seconds would have finished Conner mcgregor .
7717
7711
Diaz...is undisputed 😂
A message to conor &#39; if you really wanna be the champion again ,you need to go back from where you have started &#39;.
Epic fight
Lol mc croner khabib teach unbelievable chapter ..lol mcroner
The Conor Mcgregor and Nate Diaz fights, especially the rematch brought the UFC into the bigger main stream.
Nate won that too
“Best fight i’ve ever had” 🔥
Back in the day when conor was actually somewhat respectable...
These guys are warrios.
That&#39;s an bloody battle.
Dishonest referees
Khabib will never have a fight like this..
I seriously wish i saw this fight live
This is what and how a &quot;Fight&quot; should be!! Much Respect to both the fighter!🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=172">2:52</a> gives me goosebumps. Shows deep down they respect each other. They are just doing what they do to support there family’s. May the best man win.
two great fighters.
Any touch butt training for this rematch......
Is this not one of if not the greatest fight ever?!!
This is what prime conor looked like <br>It&#39;s a shame he threw his prime years away like nothing but <br>He is/was the best striker in his prime <br>And we should remember him like this fighter or his performance against Eddie not a wine seller with $500m in his bank.<br>Conor has changed MMA forever
What a battle!!!!
This fight ended with Conor on his back getting beat up. 😂😂
Diaz all time favorite❤
In this one conor was more focused and nate acted goofy
That impossible 4th round comeback by McGregor, is what makes him McGregor.
Anyone know the soundtrack at the beginning?
Ohh so those famous words  *Surprise Surprse MF The King Is Back * are from Conor
Nate was my favourite
Chicken Conor 😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=218">3:38</a> That reflex though 🥵🥶
King is back 🔥🔥🔥
McGregor King all
I love Nate pulling Conor up and then hugging.
I think it&#39;s draw
Nate won this fight. This is the definition of a bullshit decision.
Surprise surprise motherfuck..er the king is back is his dialogue 🙂
Where is match with khabib?
I want this Conor back so bad.
Legends allow s win
Sem dúvidas,  dois dos melhores lutadores de mma da história.
I like how that nate guy persevered even though he was in much worse condition...
Conor shots are so accurate
He kick Nate Diaz butt that day I think he&#39;s been smoking too much bud lately
Blood everywhere
Trash edit. Just watch the actual fight
McGregor lost
Only average MMA fighters put on great fights and I want to thank these average fighters.
Nates new nickname should be the blood king
Nate barely lost<br>Conor barely won<br>♤♡♧◇
They need a trilogy to finish it off
Honestly diaz wins the 3rd this was a different conor and still couldnt pull the finish.
I think Conor after the second nate diaz fight and especially after the floyd fight changed. He definitely got CTE, the way he speaks and moves, his style as well, became one dimensional and more focus on boxing rather than overall striking. <br>But he could still never beat khabib, even when he was in his prime, he would&#39;ve gotten dominated by khabib. Khabib is a different beast.
I thought they were fighting fo real. Dint know it was a movie
that McGregor last word is still hits forever
exhausted at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=166">2:46</a>. Focus and gave it all at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=168">2:48</a>.
Nate is like a zombie, getting pumbled but never stops coming after you. Wonder who would have won if there wasn&#39;t a clock.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=290">4:50</a>
Nate won that fight
Damn, what a fight! Both of them true warriors! Respect for the fighters!
Nate won that fight. Conor should have had a couple points deducted for dropping his hands turning his back to Nate and running to the other side of the octagon like 6 times  like a punk
He said rinse and spit Conner said I love the taste of blood. Num num.
Winner or loser both are legend&#39;s ❤️❤️🔥🔥
Legendary
Hotoz ve köpek dövüşü yasak ama insan dövüşü serbest şu hale bak akan kana bak amq böyle sporun
I love the UFC. That&#39;s literally all there is to comment lmao.
Lmfao 5 rounds. Talk about editing.
After two rounds:<br><br>Conor&#39;s Gas Tank: Mur Mur Mur Mur Mur!
To this day, this fight is so rigged, It was so obvious that nate won, the only rounds conor had any success at all were 1 and 4, the rest of the fight, Nate completely just dominated, like he really dominated. i really dont understand how conor won if it wasnt even close to a draw, its like saying conor won in conor vs khabib.
Conor👍
Holy c@ap dude those guys deserve every penny they earn!
Nate won that one!!!
Muito sangue que nojooo
Lol it&#39;s wild they didn&#39;t show a single clip of McGregor sprinting across the octagon to avoid Nate.
Jake Paul can’t beat Diaz by ko , it’s impossible man has a chin of a rock
shame on humanity
209 in ya azzz bietches
That was a war...
Go
Nate <br>It is easy come on <br><br><br><br>Cornor I put my life on it go put all in
Nate Diaz le viking
Nate&#39;s like a machine, he can switch his gas tank on at later rounds!!!
Nate only bleed s shame eyes only opening  .. I think he must give up n play tennis
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=120">2:00</a> Did Conor just got saved by the bell?
Conor is a legend, his best weight class is 145, still he fighting at 170
McGregor is overrated
Most entertaint fight of history
Whiskey and too much smoke effects
It just feels like nate won
I freakin love Nate’s fighting style 👑🐐
Stockton slap.
I wish he’d bring back the karate stance. Dude was so solid. I mean in the fighting game you get bad stretches. Hope he bounces back. But even if not the run was incredible changed mma forever like it or nit
Man this hits hard when I need motivation to finish every single problem in my life.
Du din
Not fair
Diaz can take a beating. Imagine Conor keep landing hits and Diaz wont stay down.
Nate is a trooper
Nate be fighting this small guy and still losing LMA
Nati Diaz is soldad
They had this edit with some good music but it’s gone now
Diaz forever.
Much respect for both fighters . But I think Nate is the better fighter.
Vegan gainzzz lad!
Didn&#39;t know UFC fights were movies 😂
<b>Nate Diaz the best! Especialista em jiu-jitsu brasileiro</b> 🇧🇷🇺🇸
Hell of fight ... Respect to Both fighter... And I really like Nate fighting spirit &quot;he just kept going and going after so much blood&quot;&quot;
Still don&#39;t understand why connor mgregkr cardio is so bad
This is the nastiest sport ever
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=167">2:47</a> what’s the original music called

So much striking<br><br>Dafq is dis K1?
Damn good fight!! Kinda emotional you two did a great job!!! 💪💪
Conor needs to do some cardio.<br>Nate can just take so much punishment like its nothing.  You can tell the difference between them is that Nate grew up naturally tough, probably in a roug neighborhood, getting into fights, where I bet Conor didnt get into fighting until later on in life.
The music at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=167">2:47</a> got me every time i watch dis,  if anyone know da music background right it down below my comment plz.
Why does Nate Diaz eyes burts easily...is it from excessive stitches or he just had baby skin
Nate diaz fights till death!!
yoy think whichky gonna help you????
We need Conor vs nate 3 <br>Both of them cannot defeat Dustin.<br>So it&#39;s better they fight each other and give us such a epic fight again
Let&#39;s make movie on khabib vs mcgregor 🔥
I admire nate for letting this kid win, i bet he couldn&#39;t take another loss
😇
Has Nate ever been knocked out?
The respect at the end of the fight was everything 💪
Diaz won that fight!
He actually had good defense in this rematch
Brilliant editing job loved it watched it every time it pops up , gets better every time 👍🏻
I miss this conor prime 😐
This version of Conor is completely missing nowadays
For Nate it’s just another day in the office…
Name 1 Conor fight that was boring?
Joe Things got REAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL interesting Rogan...
We want this Conor McGregor back meh!! 🥺
What I love about Nate is that he never gives up
connor has a very low gas tank
In this shape connor would‘ve destroyed everyone
I want to see them 2 smoke a joint together
Is this a movie scene ?
🐔
feel like it was a draw
Amazing
The best
MAN, Nate Díaz endurance is anormal o.0
That was definitely 2 to 3 rounds Nate Diaz
Habib Nur Mamedov ⚰️🤣
Nate won this fight too
One of the best moment - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=233">3:53</a>
Nate should&#39;ve won. But yes, the greatest fight in UFC I&#39;ve seen.
I swear nate has so much nerve damage he doesn’t even feel pain anymore. This is the kinda fight I love, not grappling and choking
Nate is just a beast, like dude doesn&#39;t get tired.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=11">0:11</a> Lady in red  dress  gets  elbow liver punch
I think the decision / result is fake... conor got so so many shots , he was just defending.... How can he win ?
2021
A fricking blood bath
Someone lands a leg kick <br>Joe Rohan: HE ROCKED HIM
Conor honestly won cause he put boxed Nate in the first 2 and 5 Conor came back
He guys is this real or movie
Prefect fight for both guys. The ultimate test for diaz chin. McGregors stamina. Both willing to stand and bang
Conor is unreal
Such a war Nate fighting weight is incredible he looks massive.Two warriors.
What&#39;s the intro music? It&#39;s so intense 🔥
Nate Diaz a.k.a the hardest man of all times
WOW!! Just.. WOW!!
Another round and Conor would’ve died
Conor ❤❤
A mayor confianza mayor traicion
The best fight
Definitely they left it all inside the octagon. Such a great fight!
Stoner vs Drunk
It&#39;s coming.
I come back to watch this fight, just to realise how good conor was, I&#39;m from Ireland conor gave us the best times, we don&#39;t have much to cheer about but conor u gave this little country some good memories
Joe Rogan is so biased
Eso fue un robo ganó Diaz
I still think Nate won the match you should never count blood when it comes to Diaz Bleeding is His thing like he goes super Saiyan
Dias is like that one boss in a game that generates extra HP when you’re just about to beat him
see, this is why khabib shouldn&#39;t take trash talk too seriously, see hw conor and nate still congratulate each other after the fight, who is childish here? it&#39;s just business, why so serious zzz
The are really  fighters 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍🖤
this is why khabib prefers wrestling over this type of fighting style...
all the coke and booze takes a toll on your stamina
Essa Luta Foi Show,Torci Muito pelo Diaz 💥
Is this a movie clip......
miss these fights
Nate is a embarrassment to sports all over the world
I love Nate as a fighter way more than Conor...however...the way Conor is drained and literally has nothing left in the last 2 rounds...&amp;&amp; Finishes rather strong for a non war fighter.. he&#39;ll forever have my respect.ROUND 3 WAR DIAZ V MCGREGOR SETTLE THE SCORE!!ONCE AND FOR ALL🛡️⚔️🎉❤️
Conor mcgregor vs nate Diaz 3 coming soon 👀
Conor should’ve already knocked him out at the beginning he had the chance bro that’s crazy lol
What&#39;s He become now😥
I think Dana is saving their triology for the bad days because he know that their Part 3 will be the biggest headlines of MMA in recent years... ..Boy I can&#39;t wait for this to end
One of the most biggest baddest fight of conor...miss this type of conor those day...back this type of conor...
miss this version of Conor man.
Who else here after McGregor vs piorier 3 :(
Kakashi vs obito fight 🔥
Nate could probably retire, be a blood donor and be more successful.
Verdadeira guerra
I love cornor God bless you love from india
I love you khabib💪
Go up two divisions and fight a war with Nate Diaz in this way, it&#39;s just amazing and that&#39;s because Conor McGregor is an historical.
It’s fights like these that make the UFC the UFC
This is a fight were Conor displayed a lot of heart ❤️🙏
It&#39;s the biggest fight in UFC history. legend
Imagine this was the first UFC in 93, no rules, no time limits, no weight divisions, no judges, no tapouts JUST FIGHT AND SUBMISSIONS
why are the majority of the comments salty muslim Khabib fans? funny how Islam is supposed to be a religion of peace, yet I always see the complete opposite from them, good job muslims, I&#39;m not converting anytime soon.
Anyone else see the lady in the dress get elbowed in the stomach in the beginning 😂😂
︎
Watching this after the Chicken got humbled
What a fight!
Unstoppable force meets immovable object.
Khabib be like <br>That is cute
Diaz is strong of all time
Really want to see khabib vs nate. But khabib just was retired
This really was a dog fight
Disclaimer: in this video we saw wrong highlights <br>Where McGregor got devastated 🤣😂
Lmao they even made a movie 😭😂
Nate won the 2nd fight
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=72">1:12</a> Nate’s like calm down bruh you talking to much.
Was Conor tapping to Nate and Khabib part of the movie?
Any khabib 🐻 fans here ?
The fact there wasn’t a trilogy proves Dana was trying to milk everything he could out of Conor. The UFC has really done the Diaz brothers dirty.
We need a 3
What’s the soundtrack in the beginning
Conors Career Ended The Moment He Decided To Fight Nate Diaz
Team nate
Modern day warriors
Meanwhile bloodbank team b like:-<br>Lets head towards vegas.
We whant this Connor...<br>My god what a show..
They all doubt me, doubt me now
The look in conor eyes when he said these are champion rounds
And then Khabib came
Nate won
2-0
<b>Movie clips</b> literally made this awesome asf I swear, it&#39;s like a diry or story that reminds you from 2 legends fought eachother...
AND STILL the biggest fight in MMA history.<br>Total respect to both men.
Nates at the ends like wtf
How is this a sport
Believe it or not... Nate won this fight
We need this conor in the trilogy against DP
Probably the best MMA fight I’ve ever seen.
Lmao, “the king is back!”  Nate strangled you the first time and then you squeak by a majority decision.  ☺️
From plumber to ufc icon wow
Rory McDonald vs Robbie Lawer is the biggest fight in mma
Not gonna lie, Nate Diaz has a talent for having his face absolutely obliterated and acting like it&#39;s nothing
At exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=169">2:49</a> you can see the change in Conor’s eyes, like he switches to the reserve tank or calms himself and refocuses.
This legit looks like a real life ufc fight
Diaz brothers just run out of rounds
I carnt think of any fighters out there that can match the heart of these two
Loved that sportsmanship after the fight both guys proved why they are living legends
God is great
That was well worth the money
He literally wanted to fight he like nah get up
Lets go Nate .
I watch it before Connor Dustin 3🇮🇪💯⚔️💪🏻
With a Stance of Southpaw that has range and a mixture of Legkicks plus Boxing and Counter punch Thst makes conor A superior striker
Khabib UP😂
Nate Diaz 💀🔥
How are they not re matching? Money doesn’t talk
“Keep it flowy...flowy Artem”
Best Match i have ever seen
McGregor = Naruto<br>Diaz = Sasuke<br><br>This reminded me of their brutal taijutsu fight at the end of the series 🔥
Realest fight scene
Conor McGregor is awesome!
Conor vs nate 3? I always like bloody fight, close and unpredictable fight like this.
Nate will rock him in street fight
What ufc was this?
Nate won this fight
This is the definition of “you should see the other guy”
2017 Conor is something else
Gregord losser
Greatest fight in UFC history all in
Tht women in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=10">0:10</a>🤣🤣 got hurt
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=161">2:41</a> &quot;Rinse and spit!&quot; <br>Conor: <b>Nah fak you mate...</b>
conor has a lot of power in that left hand, nates chin is just wild. Welterweights like Edwards and Jorge can&#39;t even put him out with punches, Jorge needed a headkick to drop him.
It&#39;s a draw fight they both win
Khabib would bring a whole different show to the table. Undefeated undisputed for a reason.
Diaz Wins
Diaz won that fight and everyone knows it.
These two are so good. Though I really hate seeing both of them hurt and bloody. I like both of them equally. Much respect to both.
Nate esa pelea fue tuya
2021 needs mcgregor vs diaz 3
Most of the blood on conor is from Nate&#39;s face
why are not you making video on khabib<br>-Where is problem he is undefeated champion .<br>😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
Now i knw why people respect Nate Diaz man he is goat
You know nate&#39;s done when mcgregor looks like he&#39;s bleeding even though the does&#39;nt even have a single cut .
Joe &quot;we have ourselves a fight&quot; Rogan<br><br>    ....damnit i don&#39;t think that was Joe 😒😁........dmt
Aztec warrior and Celtic berserker ✊
This literally played out like a well written movie fight
Kavanagh: “rinse and spit”<br>Conor: <b>swallows</b><br>Kavanagh: 😑
Im a diaz fan but i can say conor won the rematch. Should get a point taken away for running tho
Conor is real king 👑👑👑
The final seconds of round 5  Diaz rips the body he can&#39;t breath works the head he&#39;s out Connor is out and falling over he stood straight up on his toes just so he could fall into Diaz giving him the take down and surviving can&#39;t deny DIAZ HAD HIM KO&#39;D GREY MAYNARD STYLE
I like the documentary. When Connor first started out I though no fighter would be as skilled as him. Now he good but not as great as he first was. I remember when he knock out aldo within seconds.
The nod they gave eachother between the 2nd and 3rd is why I love em both. They both respect a good fight.
This is what respect is
Not fighters.They are LEGENDS❤
Khabib can never go this far
When you put all your points into defense and regeneration, you get Nate Diaz<br>When you put all your points into literally everything except stamina, you get Conor.
Legend 🙏🏻
Nate lost years of his life here
No matter how you slice it Conor won 1, 2 and 4.. They are just the facts
Connor stamina bothers me just like Canelo’s lol they used to beating people easily that they don’t work on their cardio that much.
Nick Diaz army ✊
best punches you can see man, end of conversation
“Biggest fight in MMA history” <br>Seems like every Conor or Khabib fight is the biggest in history
Should’ve been a draw man
Nah man I think nate won
He bit off more than he could chew. He wasn&#39;t a natural Welt3rweight. Should&#39;ve fought Nate in Lightweight atleast .
I&#39;m gonna be honest this fight got me watching ufc back in 2016
The brotherhood of mma..they both acknowledged each other
Conner gets tired easily that’d the problem
Low leg kicks mede him win in 2017 and lose him 2020
McGregor will never ko nate diaz
Nate is terminator
Khabib still the Best🔥🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=12">0:12</a> oh sorry
Conor was literally saved by the bell 3 times.
Hate or love Conor he gave us a top 3 fight of all time
woah! everytime i watch it and think nate diaz is a great punching bag
Can we please see the Conor, Nate trilogy?
nate diaz ,,,,shock proof👍
Watched the fight live and nate obviously won but they gave the win to conor because it would make him look weak if he lost twice and if they ever had a 3rd fight a 1 to 1 record would make more money.
Nate won
Wow this was crazy
That&#39;s how you fight for real not giving up respect to them both<br>For brutally hurting them selfs for our intertainment 🔥🔥
After this i have to watch khabib vs mc regor
The king is back!!!!<br><br><br><br>To get whooped by khabib🙂
McGregor one of the greatest
Connor barley won this. Nates efficiency is insane
Why they edited the part where conor was running
👍
Nate diaz is like the final boss in a movie you throw your best moves at him and when the smoke clears he still standing....
Nate is durable as they come. To have choked out Conor, and then to take Conor to the fifth round. Conor was definitely on survival mode.
Reminds me of the final fight of Creed
If Nate didn&#39;t start the second round the way he did, getting knocked down twice, he gets the majority decision.  Nate finished the second beating Conor down.  Unfortunately that is what cost him this match.  the first two and half minutes of the second. <br><br>   Conor runs away in a cowardly fashion way too much for me to respect him.  He simply lacked the conditioning that was needed here.  Nate is ready to brawl at all times.
Nate dias bleeds so much its scary it looked like the scenes from 300
Should&#39;ve been a split decision.
Nate is real life Metal Bat.
I always come back to this fight again and again after watching other great fights. I come back to Nate Diaz,Conor Mcgregor, Nick Diaz fights at the end of every fights I watch. Nate Diaz has one of the greatest fights in his name so, does Conor Mcgregor. They put their everything, they gave their everything, they gave their 100 + 100 = 200% into this fight. They both are winners. If the fight had lasted little bit longer Nate would&#39;ve won the fight again. Conor was already down and Nate was re energized\recharged while hiting Conor like he was 100% back at it again. But that doesn&#39;t mean Conor is weaker. They both are real fighters. They both performed one of the best fight in the history of M.M.A\U.F.C. All my respect, appreciation, admiration, all the credit goes to these two living legendary great fighters🙏🙏👏👏👍️👍️💖💖🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️💐💐✌️✌️
The way Nate picked up Conor at the end of the fight and Conor hugged him back. You could tell that they had earned infinite respect for one another
The way this was edited is like some Spartans or Gladiators fighting to the death
He painted the Octagon, and himself in Nate&#39;s blood.
This is more entertaining than those wrestlers in UFC and MMA
I have to truthfully say this should&#39;ve been a draw man. Both of them went into straight warrior mode the entire time. I&#39;m with diaz for life but i say it was a draw.
Khabib is the Best madicine for Connor.
poo
💎 This was the end of an era 💎
Aguante nate díaz
What a fight. Straight out of a movie
Nothing.
Jake paul thinks he can beat this legendary man, what a clown🤡
Robbery, Nate is the winner for me anytime
These guys are warriors
Notice how they told Conor don&#39;t push anything we got 4 to go? They knew nates cardio was unreal.
The blodiest and best fight i ve ever seen
Wdym this is not a movie.,, this is a goddamn movie
And they say he can beat khabiib lol 🤭🤭🤭
How can you forget these fights and start calling him a tap machine coz he lost to khabib ? <br><br>This man is responsible for putting MMA on the map ! A lot of people started watxhing UFC coz of him
these 2 boys put there lives into this fight. probs
Bruh people like Nate are scary, usually people say in a fight always swing first but Nate the typa guy to eat your shot and be like &quot;is that it&quot;!
Nice fight
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=102">1:42</a> was almost lights out again for mcgregor
Chicken 🍗
Nate and Connor are both G&#39;s!!
Nate was robbed :/
Nate won that fight - he was robbed and we all know why: a Conor loss would’ve sorely hurt his brand and the $$$ flow for the UFC at the time.
Can’t believe Jake Paul is even comparing himself to Conor
Conor&#39;s chin in this fight man, that&#39;s something special
This is the conor that needs to fight poirier
Whoever edited this did spectacular!
Absolute chills.
Diaz didn&#39;t care about hurting Conor. He only wants to touch him.
How connor won this fight I&#39;ll never know. When I watched the whole thing...not the highlight reel....I thought nate won. Either way, agree or disagree, this deserves the trilogy.
had a big fire under him after the first fight 💯 we’ll see the same conor when he ko’s dustin with a left head kick or left hook 1-3 round
Jake Paul thinks he can knock Nate Diaz out in 3? Has he seen this video?
Stumbled on this on the recommended section Dude I’ll give Conor credit where it’s due this man has a beard on him at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=102">1:42</a> of this clip Nate catches him FLUSH with a headkick where I saw this fight live I never noticed that.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=99">1:39</a> NATE diaz slapped Conor
imagine it was 6 rounds, Nate would have won.
This trilogy is a necessity
Jake Paul be like, “I can take him”
I knew McTapper wasn’t gonna show the first one
I always push myself hard a week before a match with my brother. So then I can be friends with the tiredness and exhaustion so they won’t effect me as much during the match. It works for me
Esse lixo desse diaz é feio de mais 🤮
2.28  suppose to go green
Nate diaz is a fokin zombie
Nate combination are treat to eyes
A lot of people don’t know nate Diaz is a black belt in jujitsu because he likes to stand most of his fights
God bless stay safe ✝️✝️✝️
Gentlemen in the world
Great Fight!!! Respects!!!
this a movie now? YUHHH
easy, nate is a vegan and vegan dont have meat. he dont feel pain in his body
MMA is more brutal than boxing
170 pound cerone fight McGregor would smoke Diaz. You can see moving up from featherweight to welterweight so fast he has put on wasteful body mass. Where as in the cerone fight he was naturally 170, muscle in the right places and his heart and cardiovascular would have adjusted to the muscle mass. I’d love to see this rematch
Just want Conner to hit us with the “ Surprise Surprise “ against Dustin after the trilogy ):
Nate WON, and Dana white knows it
Nate is literally a machine
Love the respect they gave each other after the fight I love this sport
Nate takes a punch like nobody ive ever seen
If he fights Dustin like this he wins
I miss this conor so much
Nate may not be the best boxer in the UFC but he&#39;ll go 5 rounds all day.
Just me or is ufc like gladiators but modern times
Man Nate never go away 😎😎, rocky of MMA
Nate Diaz is so overrated .. this is his biggest win and he&#39;s beating another person who&#39;s overrated so I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s that big a deal
Crazy that Conor has won only once since 2016 and his fans think it&#39;s just about him being hungry again.
Conor fans be like, &quot;bUtWhAtAbOuT hIs kArAtE sTaNcE?!?!&quot;
Diazs punches were so weak. The faces of both of them the next day told the whole story. Diaz was unrecognizable while McGregor looked brand new.
How did conor win this fight lol totally rigged
I watch this when I bored lol
One word- “ Khabib ”🔥🦅🔥
Man Nate falls but omg he eats those punches and always tries to counter . Wow
Nate: i will spread my blood on my face to conor&#39;s for him to look like he is hurting
The king is back 😆😂😆 the referee help you lol
Yeah this video is sick!
It’s was a close fight
Nate definitely took Conor to the deep end. Nate has got a helluva chin.
Ahahaha i like how a dude on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=11">00:11</a> punches in the stomach a chick
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=200">3:20</a> Lmao Conor dyed his hair red with Nate&#39;s blood.
He iz a  GREAT SPORTSMAN Of the MILENIUM
Dog fight
The 2nd fight ended with Nate on top landing ?<br>And Conor got tapped in the first ?<br>Nate&#39;s the real winner.
0 title defenses
Nate&#39;s team is like a Nascar team everyround they gotta take off and replace with new tires lol
2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣1️⃣
when they both shook there heads at each at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=173">2:53</a>...they both know there in a dark place right now final rounds
If conor had the cardio of nate, UNSTOPPABLE
Went 25 min against Diaz triathlete pressure damn and still swung full force each punch
COLEY FOLEY NEVER: SAW THIS MOVIE &quot;NOTORIOUS&quot; BEFORE... (INTERESTING... AND... COLEY FOLEY ADMIRES &quot;CONOR&#39;S&quot; GIRL... HAHAHA!) ON &quot;STARZ/ENCORE&quot; RIGHT NOW.
McGregor looks like kratos in god of war
I love how they made this a hole movie lmfao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=159">2:39</a>
Yessssssssssssss
We want this McGregor again, he hasn&#39;t been himself since the Khabib fight and as of Nate, he and his brother are really great they came from nothing and have achieved so much in the UFC world always respect to them.
Beautiful just beautiful! Diaz brothers are beasts!
To who all that reads this God has a plan for you.  Stay positive and strong...❤🙏
Hope this Nate shows up for leon
Nate was robbed
This is insane 🙏
You have to kill DIAZ brothers to stop them from fighting.. true ironheart
nate got robbed
Funny thing Jake call out both 😂
legends never die they fight
Feel like they gave it to Connor to build up a third fight.
Damn what a fight, can’t stop watching this
Horrible editing!
Nate Diaz always puts on a fantastic fight.  Amazing battle.
Conor is the boss
Who&#39;s here after porier TKOed him
I watch often this dog fight.what a  match
This should&#39;ve been either a draw or a split decision for Conor...
The apathetic children eventually comb because reason neuroanatomically unlock past a outgoing brain. childlike, concerned expansion
We need this Cornor again ✊
bro this was a fight like none other
One more minute and Nate win..
Suck stamina 😂😂😂😂 🐔
This is art, ma man!!!!
Cinematic look. Nice!
khabib ❤️
Wish his movie came out in 2019 so it could&#39;ve included the khabib saga
Who won this fight.?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=144">2:24</a> John didn’t know what to say to him😭
Diaz is just a strong chin, no more
McGregor is all good until he met Khabib. LOL
Ur connor
Praise to nate I have never seen a persistent fighter till now.
I would love to fight Conor McGregor
AMAIZING GREAT FIGHT ONE OF THE BEST FIGHT IN HISTORY OF UFC 💥💥💥
Haha...no offense....but nate is really a fat skinny guy
Nate won that..Robbed
I like the part were they fight
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=92">1:32</a> Does anyone know Diaz Said what😅🤤🤤😜🤭???
if you pause it at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=265">4:25</a> you can see joe peeking over buffers shoulder and seeing the winner on the card and smerks<br>  lol
Nate must be on drugs to take so much beatings
Not gonna lie I knew Conor was gonna win because of all those hits
This fight is fix for win fight corner   look before bruse buffer Alounsment   refry hand s up corner    look the closely
Fun fact the blood on Conor was nates
Diaz... Im Surprise now
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=250">4:10</a> the handshake 😖😖😖
Too much blood
Diaz got robbed
That was a dog fight 🐶🐕🐕‍🦺
I think this fight should ended with the  draw decision
They tries to kill each other lol
If Nate had a good fighting style he would be amongst top tier just imagine if his coach was khabib
It shoulve been a draw
Conor doesn&#39;t hve the same chin anymore
This was clearly suppose to be a draw
Parece ser de verdade 😳😳
I think Conor ruined his legacy and its sad because he work so hard to be the guy who he was back in that /15/16/17.

How I see my toys fighting...
this is an actual movie?
Good strategy by conor... Run run run... Til you reach final round
Diaz’s whole training and fight style is based on fighting at least 3-5 rounds. The fact that mcgregor even survived that is impressive
Steroid Vs whiskey
Conor used to be so hungry😭
I like to think that Nate&#39;s immortal
Incredible fight i miss this McGregor
Blood everywhere
They fighting and blooding and destroying themselves, and for what? a peice of belt?<br>And people enjoy this?<br><br>Humanity is in serious question.
2 barely average fighters going toe to toe..
Oh God I want this Conor again in action
Are they ever gonna set up a 3rd fight 🤷🏿‍♂️
how nate is taking all this hits, everybody else would lose 3 round before that
Teu lucu ah... Babaturan anjingmm
Love/hate Diaz  he&#39;s a tough  cat.
Rewatching this made me realize conors corner is terrible they give him no useful advice
Fight with Floyd made him kind of slower. So money is what makes different otherwise we could have same Conor these days.
The only time i saw what is called ..motivated conor <br><br>Admit it guys this guy is no more
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=125">2:05</a> so smooth! Love it
Song please <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=167">2:47</a> – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=236">3:56</a>
Look at the blood on both
Let’s be honest Diaz would have won this fight if he got knocked down one less time I thought Nate won 3 rounds to 2 rounds
Nate class act....
Surprise surprise motherF the king is dead
This is Conor in his prime he got rocked by Dustin Conor your time has come and gone
This Mcgregor is the best fighter in ufc history
Win stolen, change my mind.
Why is this on here I thought it was movies
dont hate anyone in this game very hard for there family to watch this people should appreciate both fighters win ir lose its game
Nate had him on the ground and the bell rang. McGregor saved by the bell, 1 more minute nate would have submitted him.
Surprise mfs the king on his back sleeping 😂
We need the trilogy to this match up
I wanna coach his son
This was conor at his best in my opinion
We need a 3rd fight with Conor and Diaz each fight has been amazing to watch
came back to watch this cause this same exact thing is gonna happen when conor gets that rematch with dustin tired of all these people writing conor off hes gonna come back better and stronger mark my words hell be on top by the end of 2021.
Who else thinks Nate won?💯
What a crazy fight this was. They ate so many shots it’s unbelievable. Both legends!
Who won the match
Nate, he looks like DeadPool...
i remember when i saw conor lose to nate and it really seemed like he&#39;s done. and same thing with khabib too, what inspires me in that man is how he deals with failure.
Weed vs Whiskey
And Logan Paul wants to fight him
This was one of the most entertaining matches to watch, felt like a fight to the death from start to finish
This Conor didn’t show up last Saturday
Why not a trilogy.
Whrere were the kicks against poirier
this is the best McGregor, the lovely McGregor is trash
Poirier&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nate,Diaz don&#39;t use low kick so pathetic.
God please bring this McGregor back.
2 yrs later
Lol are you allowed to slap in the UFC?
Why cant Conor be like this? 🥺
Roubado Diaz foi campeão
Who’s watching this after he lost in second round
This Conor in a trilogy with Dustin will close the show in one round
Diaz pulling Conor up is legendary. What a good action of sportsmanship.
wheres the part were he was running from diaz
Conor fighting style was so much different againts poirier<br>He ain’t the same tho
A wounded lion is very dangerous than a fit one
Conor won the fight, Nate won the hearts!! ♥️♥️
&quot;mcgregor is hanging on&quot; while a few slaps land and any big blows are slipped.<br>Rogans knowledge is immense 😂
I react the same way unreal
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=217">3:37</a> look how conor moves like a snake
Movie clips hat jz einf 48m abonennten
10 seconds in, when conor knocks him down you see his Mrs in the red dress jumping &amp; cheering ringside.  The guy next to her jumps up at the same time and WHACK elbows her in the guts! She took it well, McGregor style.
i like how they are literally repairing Nate every round
All the hate between each other was all business. I think they respect each other. Best UFC rivalry?
This is one of my favorite fights all time
That nod of mutual respect bro
This is how it might go Conor with Dustin
Let’s talk about how Conor was destroying err body else he fought, an Diaz came in on eleven days notice the first fight an submitted em... Then beat em up in this fight.... Diaz a monster
✌
Me ido llorar 😭
Use to hate Nate but this fight was what turned me into a fan. Class from him helping Connor up at the end
I wonder why they make a movie about Conor McGregor even though you can see it in UFC :/
This fight who win world know but make joker win no one believe this fake joker
Roubaram a luta do Diaz pra não ficar muito feio pro McGregor. Ia dar prejuízo pro UFC pq o estrelinha era mais famoso.
IS THIS BEFORE  SMASHING OR AFTER SMASHING....?? SOMEBODY  TELL ME
At the end of the day this fight was a pointless money fight. It was a great fight for sure but I think most casuals who watch conor forget the reason diaz fought him in the first place was because RDA pulled out late and had to make it a welterweight bout. So the ufc only made the second fight happen because they knew they could make money off of a mcgregor comeback arc.
No way  Conor won this fight😂
its so funny how wrong joe rogan does be and how much he influences what people think
Respect to both
such a glorious battle.
In both of their fights Nate had the strength, energy, athleticism and body build advantage<br>Conor underestimated him in the first fight but he didn&#39;t back down, he got back up and went at it again and that deserves respect, cause to go 5 rounds with a guy like Nate Diaz is no easy game<br>Overall I think this was an equal fight between the two of them cause they both unleashed the dog inside of themselves
Nate Diaz,one hard man.
Nate DiaZ💪💪💪
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=172">2:52</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=175">2:55</a> beautiful!
When u beat ur faster Younger brother but he comes back prepared next time
This was when mcgregor was getting to hollywood and in his own head for his own good... hes always been the ultimate talker but that was mind games but then he started believing his own BS
Wtfis wrong with this jake paul tossa. Ue wants to fight THIS GUY!!!
This is why I love connor, you&#39;ll never see a khabib fight like this. Fought in 3 divisions against all types of styles. Legend.
Naruto vs sasuke in real life.
They hugged like brothers at the end, and that is called respect.
What did Connor say at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=140">2:20</a> when he leans over?
Only lost 2 in the ufc and both losses coming from 2 elite if not the best fighters on the ground yet people still hate on him
Diaz would have easily TKO&#39;d Conor if he wasnt a vegan and had some damn power in his hands instead of pillows...
jake paul really thinks hes better than this💀💀
Rogan really called this fight like Nate was his brother or something lmao.
Hell of fight dogs hell of fight
time for part 3 before it&#39;s too late
This is the fight that turned Nate into a zombie
Nate won js
Robbed
and jake paul still wanna fight him
That 5th round was close but I still think Conor won it
Khabib 🤟😎 defeat conor
Sei não em kk
Eu amor luta eu tenho meu filho vou botar ele pra lutar
They need to go back again
Diaz looks tired before the fight and looks 100% in 5th round.
Am I the only guy who watched more than 10 times and still thinks Diaz won this fight?
I wonder how many brain cells they lost ?
Magrego,força,precisão,resistência...o melhor
this was a beautiful fight
If we count strike landed of course diaz won. Many says connor cheat but actually connor win 3 rounds and nate won 2. Its how they judge in UFC. Connor won fair n square
NATE IS NAILS
Respect nate Diaz
Conor looking like kratos after fighting
This fight is the greatest fight in MMA history
Nate dont retreat he moves forward and is game as they come
This was the best fight I have ever seen in my life
what a fight diocaneeee
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=99">1:39</a> moms when u even breathe without cleaning ur room
this video just motivates me everytime I feel low... stay Blessed Conor, you have changed lives of millions around the globe. Very proud of you brother!
conor mcgergor king okay😎😎❤
Nate wins! Is a Lion..
Cena pra filme
Was a very close fight, could have gone either way.
Intro music?
Conor mcdumbass is NOT 5&#39;9 more like 5&#39;6 Nate towered over him ... Nate is not a very muscular guy so that makes me think Conor McGregor of course is a big cokehead and has probably paid his way through failed drug test the ice pack to the chest he will have a heart attack before he&#39;s 40... And I want to see rematch 3 Nate will beat him...again
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=91">1:31</a> you can’t get away from me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=170">2:50</a> best part for me was that they nod to each other before the next round started. It was both giving respect to each other to fight one of the best fights in history for themself and others.
Jake Paul 😂😂😂
paid off judges . Nate won again// ufc u should be ashamed
Nate really got good durability iron head
Mcgregor he Lost
Jack Russell terrier is brought hunting for a reason,take a fat jack Russell will it ? No it won&#39;t, all dogs afraid of a propper jack Russell
What would the point of competing be if there was no competition? Gotta love someone that can challenge and push you to greater heights!
joe ‘and he just rocked him’ rogan
This is not UFC, this is dog fight.
Big fight
Great fight really close but Conor won 1 2 4 winning 3 2 in rounds
This fight should be in the hall of fame
Que pálisas
Connors word at the end best fight his ever been given💪👌
O like Nate Diaz, The Best
Imagine if this came out after the khabib fight. They’d have to show him getting mauled
you&#39;re only as good as your opponents<br><br>and unfortunately for khabib...  he was never really tested and that will always be a nark on his legacy
Epic Battle 💣💣
Why Nate didnt fight Kahbib? He woulda wrecked him
🤣😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂😝😝😝😝
😂😂😂😂😂🤘🤘🤘🤟🤟🤟🤟
Khabib Bro ❤️I love you because you beaten McRager like dog 😂😂😘❤️❤️
I&#39;m Irish and I can&#39;t stand the man
Nate throws a punch and misses<br>Joe: NATE JUST ROCKED HIM
Nate got stamina man ... F*cking stamina
I don&#39;t get it I mean,Nate gave so many punches and more attacks and McGregor was about to go down
Great fight. Two warriors 💪🔥
Good thing the doc was released in 2017 and NOT in 2018😂
Hardly redemption when this was a close fight that could&#39;ve gone either way; honestly another 10 seconds Nate would&#39;ve had the finish
The bloodiest fight i ever Seen
No losers here
Nate can only count to 5
МакГрегор велик
Nate will never look the same
Not a quitter,,,, hell of a fight.... 2 CHAMPS
2nd fight was a close one... What sucks is we won&#39;t see the 3rd one.  I guess we&#39;re all winners thanks to this 2 Warriors
conor is a 1-3 round fighter but nothing but respect
Best fight ever
They need to do studies on Nate Diaz cause that man ain’t normal
It’s mad how there on movie clips
It should have been at least a split decision
It should have been at least a split decision
I wanna see khabib vs nate diaz for one last time
Still wonder why nate lost. He won twice imo
I am not into ufc but from my point of view it seems nate won<br>Can somebody explain me how connor won?
Ok this is actually nuts, the way it&#39;s edited too literally makes it look/feel like a movie scene.
Nate is incredible
If Nate could hit a touch harder he would have dropped Conor in those middle exchanges. His horsepower is insane.
“rinse and spit” * swallows *
I wonder what fight the judges watched
Этот бой круче чем , бой Хабиб и Геджи !
If u criticise Conors stamina here, dont forget he moved up a lot in weight
Wanna see gsp fight khabib
Khabib being like ......hmmm lunch xD
People getting confused by the blood on connor but its diaz&#39;s blood...
Should have inducted in Fight of the year nomination
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=10">0:10</a> sound great ı love this
No matter how many times I watch this fight, it never gets old
Nate is tough as nails. Both of them can take a good beating. I love this 2 fights from them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qZZWAScCn8&amp;t=11">0:11</a> she got  pregnant from the wrong dude
Best fight in the octagon ever wow props to both fighters amazing performance
Diaz is a real &quot;undead gangster&quot;💪...
