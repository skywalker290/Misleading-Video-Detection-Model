12:8 is a bacteriophage. Gross in a large form but cute imo illustrated
I really don’t think it’s his place to tell people what they can and can’t do with their bodies though.. and to tell people they look ugly just because they got something done to make THEMSELVES feel better is pretty disgusting.. I expect better from Felix
bets in the comments but you revealed it in the intro
spray pesticide over the entire earth, and everyone will get birth defects and BOOM! no children or insects.
I have a question how can one ban children
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=306">5:06</a> this is not racizm right?
I regret watching this while eating my food.

PewDiePie: &quot;I will ban all children&quot;<br><br>me: &quot;the world is gonna turn into City 17 from half-life&quot;
20% lest wants to live
POV PewdiePie logic: Black=Bad
Is he /ourguy/ ?
I should not have watched this while eating
you have my vote
Well guess what ..... pewdiepie was born an adult...
Yes it&#39;s true in Australia our bugs have anus demons and satanic moths
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=535">8:55</a> It is just a normal moth from Australia but the stuff around it makes an illusion

The tennis balls help older people alot my grandpa and great grandpa both used tennis balls so they didn&#39;t have to pick it up all the time. It would just slide around and wouldn&#39;t exhaust them as much.

The hot water in my school is white
in the uk you can drink the hot water in most modern homes
13 january now good job youtube...
Everybody grow up PewDiePie&#39;s coming
In the UK hot and cold water come from the same source and the hot water is just heated up in the boiler so its perfectly safe we used to have hot water tanks and some people still have them the problem with hot water tanks is that the water can be sitting in that tank for ages before its used in some cases people have even found dead drowned rats stuck in the tanks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=307">5:07</a> : &#39;&#39; its really bad, its black, don&#39;t use it&#39;&#39; lol

You should have clean hands in case you accidentally touch the food. But she should earn enough to pay for child care they need to step it up
Okay but we all thought eyelashes went into the back of our eyes when we were kids
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=780">13:00</a><br>But Spiders and everything you hate in this video wasn&#39;t i- whatever, i think the parasites and the spiders will RISE
Pewdiepie the puppet at the end is of a bacteriophage and In a few decades they will take the place of antibiotics! You will inject those things into your stomach and things! I know that you needed to know that.
Is he dyslexic? Not trying to be rude at all, genuinely curious bc he can never read lol
bruh why was i watching this when i was eating
Pewdiepie for planet guy illegalize children!
Who is going to tell him that spiders aren&#39;t insects.
The worst video to put on while eating dinner
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=675">11:15</a> did you know every sixty seconds a minute has passed on the moon
Wow

The spider in the headphones gave me a visceral reaction and I threw my earbud. ⚰️🪦
Why does the yoga teacher look like Count Olaf in disguise?😂😂😂
Then we take the chldren away ,more orphans
People who like spiders and know that they are not insects: <br>Alr I’ll still vote for you, but you have to know that the spiders will begin eating other things to survive
I’m a child so idk about that
i really hope the public transport thing got a LITTLE better from Covid
People are doing some wierd $hitty stuff and calling it yoga.

The Spectrum store got me. Like best of Walmart in their stores. 😆
Pewds: &quot;I will ban all children&quot;<br><br>Me: &quot;Still nicer than Trump&quot;
I don’t wanna hear Felix talking bout wack shoes when he wears platforms
But what if he got the tattoos ironically.....
This is an old video, but to anyone who sees this, he didn&#39;t quite fully explain <b>why</b> hot water isn&#39;t good. Hot water heaters have a high metallic content from the tank and in general the water, while not toxic or bacteria infested (so hot showers are fine), you really dont want to be ingesting it regularly, so use the cold water which doesn&#39;t touch the boiler.
“You don’t deserve human bodies” 🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=127">2:07</a> I was eating…

Haters
Man, the woman with the baby at work is so fucking sad and you picking on her is even sadder. Not having where to leave your newborn either because everything is closed or because you don&#39;t have enough money for it is literally one of life&#39;s lowest moments.<br><br>Respect those people, they&#39;re literally fighting to keep the child alive.

I so agree on the lip trend being disgusting, how people seriously believe they look good blowing their lips up to balloons never stops to amaze me! And sad part is they destroy whatever beauty they had. If my soul mate turns out to be a duck face I rather live alone for the rest of my life. Natural is BEAUTIFUL wake the fuck up!
the moth with tentacles though i looked up what they are and there yucca moths and they sent shivers down my spine

I can relate to the kicked parasite. When I was in 3rd grade I accidentally stepped on a praymantus. It&#39;s lower half was crushed but it was still alive and next thing you know a long black worm comes slithering out like a belly buster and the praymantus tries to kill is while it&#39;s still half in its torso. I&#39;m in 8th grade and still remember it well.....
Spiders aren&#39;t insects, he&#39;s tricking you, don&#39;t vote!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=728">12:08</a> That&#39;s a model of a bacteriophage. It&#39;s a type of virus that preys on bacteria :)

Spiders are not insects 🤯🤯🤯
the guy at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=593">9:53</a> from the “news event” is Sam Hyde and he can’t keep getting away with it.
The hot water to a black at my school to I think it’s a means of mind controlling it’s the way they create the crazy horse girls and that one obsessed with cats who scratched you because you pissed her off let’s face it we all knew one of those in elementary school
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=593">9:53</a> that guy looks like that ring meme with the pig at the door.

If a spider crawled out of my earbud I would probably kill myself
even though I am legally classified as a child I am 100% on board with the eradicate all insects and children movement
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=728">12:08</a> that thing exists, although much smaller. It&#39;s a T4 bacteriophague. They&#39;re actually dope, but they do look horrifying

its amazing how we agree this shit need to  be thrown into fire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=728">12:08</a> ,but yet we are in love with the shit that bloodborne gives us . I believe a new subreddit must be made with the title  &quot;Yes....but no thank you &quot; with stuff we love but we would throw into fire the moment we got it into our hands . Just a though ( if something like this exist please to lend me the link for i will be very thankful )
i watched this video while eating my lunch......
Lol video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=660">11:00</a> that person looks like an angry bird
Actually that puppet he saw (12:8) Was a bacteriophage which is responsible for the death of more then half of all ocean bacteria everyday! They use a stinger between they&#39;re legs to inject they&#39;re genetic material into e bacteria, then the bacteria is forced to make more phages until it is so full that the small phages produce an enzyme that explodes the host, There is almost one species of phage for every bacteria or virus out there, Also fun fact is that most viruses like Covid are just a shell of fat molecules in casing its DNA or RNA
<b>Grosssssss</b>
“We start with insects, we then take the children”. You had me there. Thats all you had to say. PEWDS FOR PRESIDENT!!!
hai
In sweden you can use hot water since boiling water usually kills off the rest of the bacteria :/

The black water reminds me of Elisa Lam.
that black water is activated charcoal......it is put there after plumbing repairs..... it cleans pipes. but it also can be accumulated minerals in pipes.

I’m Australian and moths don’t look like that.
Seeing the thumbnail I thought it was a large spider taking a shit. Now that I actually watched the video it was just a gecko inside of a spider toy.
Can’t deal with the bug ones. This ruined my day. Thanks Pewds 👍

PewDiePie:I will destroy all the kids<br>The 9 year old army:..............ok
i didnt think i could hate my own country then i saw this video
I&#39;m voting for pewds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=128">2:08</a>
apple + starbucks seems like an expensive life
So... what you&#39;re saying is that you will put all children in concentration camps? Cool.. I&#39;m down. Wait.. do you count 16 year olds? I hate other kids and teenagers as well. I know how to annoy them, entertain them, hurt them (But not physically), hurt them physically. I could be an essential asset to your uprising.
Thumbnail got me thinking wtf is that, sorry I didn&#39;t recognise Pewds...
I am never going to sleep again...
Pewdiepie 2024 for no children or wet sleeves and socks!
2 parasites and i&#39;m eating noodles
the friends with the plastic surgery is doing a jojo reference
I feel like it sounds like Felix has something in his mouth. Like a gumball or something
Pewdiepie...you better be careful calling kids germ-spreading creatures. After all, everyone who watches your channel is 9.
Hot water bad it’s black
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=625">10:25</a> i actually used to think that it was true
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=235">3:55</a> is literally what you’d see at Centrelink (here in Australia) 💀💀💀
I vote for you
Wouldnt hot water be cleaner since bacteria cant handle heat. AND doesnt it really matter since odds are its going to get boiled
I havent watched pewdipie in so long omfg, last time was like 3 years ago
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=348">5:48</a> the crocs of the future
When Felix will ban all children, humanity will not repopulate and  pass the bloodline, so all he’s doing is killing everybody, but even people who have that in mind will still vote and do everything to get Felix to the presidential seat
Introduction to this vid: No he doesn&#39;t turn it to a hat...<br>Later in the vid: guess whats his doing in the comments
The last time water was black there was a dead body in the water tank..that school might wanna check that out
With what pewds said about the hot water <br><br>1. It does boil faster<br>2. People use to drink boiled water because any other water was nasty with parasites and germs
&quot;we start with the insects, then we take the children&quot;<br>vote PewDiePie for supreme leader of earth
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=704">11:44</a> kinda looks like grey matter from ben 10
At the end I genuinely thought that a pixelings add came on but no it was just the vid
Dessa videor .. är verkligen störande.<br>Jag har aldrig varit så störd i mitt liv.<br>:(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=583">9:43</a> looks like the spider is taking a living shit.
Hi Felix.  Great video.  Please stay safe and healthy and take care of yourself and your family members.  To all members also.  Talk to you later my friend.  ☺☺☺😇😇😇
Pewds dont hate childrens cuz your subscribers are all 9 year olds

Ok so my 23 year old son used to watch you all the time when he was a teenager &amp; thought you were fab. I recently mentioned you in front of my 10 year old but before the end of my sentence she yelled; HE SUCKS! Having watched this I&#39;m inclined to agree
Yes so awful
Vote pewds 2024!
It&#39;s so embarrassing but he&#39;s right that&#39;s definitely the US with the pants and wig lady. I live here.  That&#39;s not even the worst I&#39;ve seen.

Naaa i think u can destroy the insects and the kids at the same time because there both insects
Real talk, if the bacteria in hot water can survive boiling for 10 minutes, it deserves to enter my body and make its home there.
Pretty sure water turning black like that is a sign something died in the water tanks... Hope there were no missing kids :/

What&#39;s the problem with black water?<br>Are you racist?
im ten and somehow agreed that kids are disgusting. i think im dying
I once was watching a video on how to get rid of earwigs and it had a scratchy noise like a bug wiggling around at the beginning. Then later on there was the same noise, but it was in a weird place. Took out my head phone looked inside. Yup. Earwig. Inside my headphone. Developed a new fear and habit of checking my headphones that day.
spider gang
That old lady&#39;s twisted sister wig made my day lmao
From this video onwards i will hate Reddit because im f××king horrified
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=25">0:25</a> the part where it gets weird
i just understand something why this video and images exist,<br>its because you can&#39;t getting attention for something normal.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=593">09:53</a> It&#39;s good to know that Marv from wet bandits is still alive and kicking, trying to steal people&#39;s data this time.
Thst thing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=732">12:12</a> was a bacteriophage and looks like that but its actually a good virus because it holds bacteria to spread crazy.

Boiling hot water kinda kills the bacteria...
Hello, It is me, the water nerd man. Drinking hot water is bad since certain bacteria can live in it and it can make you really sick, that is why we humans don’t like hot water, it’s a defense mechanism. Now boiling hot water is fine though because the bacteria can’t survive the boil and die, so actually I fully recommend using hot water since it boils quicker.
Felix: Every last insect will be destroyed<br>Spider: *PHEW*, close one

BRO you stop it. Stop selling little people clothes at the expense of anyone larger than a US small.  You have one chance or I&#39;ll let the libs know you&#39;re racist against anyone larger than 125 lbs.
If you&#39;re a girlie man  or tiny boy or cross dresser, get Tsuki clothes! If you&#39;re any larger than a tiny boy, nothing will fit! IT&#39;s racism against people not underweight.

Pewdipe is antichrist
The parasite is a hair worm, it goes into crickets and controls them to make them land in water, then they come out and swim

Been watching Pewds for years. This is one of the videos I remember most cause he taught me about not using hot water for consumption lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=106">1:46</a><br>I seriously thought those were mannequins.
Oli londons mom 😂
PewDiePie, shut up, like just shut up.. you&#39;re like Children are bad/stupid/disgusting but most of your viewers are kids also your comments and subs are from children, Don&#39;t belive me?? Hmph. You&#39;ll be surprised. If kids didn&#39;t exist you would have like 2 million subs. like if you agree.
The thumbnail of this video haunts me, literally, it keeps popping up asking me to watch this video.
Anyone notice at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=8">0:08</a> (pause the video) that if u look on the left of this chair it’s a 👌🏼 symbol
I was thinking of the exact same eyelash thing and then it came up in the video and I&#39;m scared
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=710">11:50</a> is the worst thing I&#39;ve ever fuckin seen
But you started as a child to pewdipie so you would ban yourself
im going to have nightmares about that moth
Na Na take children first!
This man would be the best president lol 😂
Spiders are not bugs!! They&#39;re arachnids.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=578">9:38</a> - Sort of reminds me of the scene from Ace Ventura. Is this the animal detective&#39;s pet?
felix... :( i agree that some plastic surgeries are a bit extreme but don’t say that every girl who does it is dum. they’re not soing it to please others, they’re doing it for themselves
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=730">12:10</a> Felix the puppet thing is actually based on a real thing. <br>it&#39;s based on a bacteriophage, which are microscopic viruses that kill bacteria. They are the deadliest entities on Earth.<br>I suggest googling it it&#39;s pretty interesting
‘A great use of new Vans’<br><br>I, for one, prefer the traditional method of placing them on your feet and not mutilating at least £50 worth of footwear
And pew die pie is a child stuck in a man body

Because of this video I can&#39;t put my earphones on without checking in side of it

Why not use the children to kill all of the bugs instead of killing them
pewdiepie doesn&#39;t understand how boiling water is a sanitization process..
“Babies are germ spreaders.” PewDiePie starting to sound like Sakusa from Haikyu. 🤣
I can&#39;t confirm that the airport scene was from the U.S. but damn, that&#39;s basically Florida in a nutshell!

The hot school water is black because the school dumps the souls of the poor kids in the water system and the evil of the teachers and the educational system

If there are no kids there is no future for the human race. There Felix is secretly a hyper realistic automaton trying to destroy the human race by banning all kids.

The small print at the bottom which you may have noticed reads: &quot;Please bring signed waiver agreeing to allow The Great Horned Owl to observe you silently for the duration of the Wet Yoga Practice.&quot;
I had no idea about the hot water from taps being a health risk. Apparently it&#39;s to do with lead pipes contaminating hot water more easily. Not ONE single fucking person in my entire life EVER mentioned this, and of course I&#39;d never even suspect it was unhealthy on my own, it&#39;s just tap water after all. I feel so betrayed.

It’s not the forbidden Oreo it’s actually a Cyclocosmia it’s part of the trapdoor spiders and it’s also known to be extremely rare and often called an Hourglass spider. They use their abdomens as traps doors and when a bug walks over it they sink in to the hole cause if the bug to drip in with it and they feast.(this is what happens when your “That” kid in class and when asked to do a presentation on an animal shelter Nostradamus of choosing a dog,cat,fox,wolf,shark no you choose a rare spider that terrified your classmates.

If you kill all insects than bees will not pollinate plants plants will die than we will all slowly die.<br><br>If you kill all the kids than there will be no new generation and everyone will avenaly die and the human race will be no more.

So how many of you checked your head phones (or threw them off your head while screaming) when you saw the spider in the headphones.

The thing around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=737">12:17</a> is actually in the shape of a very bad disease I can&#39;t remember what disease it is but I know it&#39;s a parasite/ disease

Time to vote minor party
I’m ready for your plan. Because of this video I agree children and bugs should be dealt with..
that australian moth is stil giving me nightmares
It&#39;s nice to know other countrys make fun of Americans as much as Americans make fun of themselves.
i like your plan please do it
I had to thumbs down because I’m prego
I was on the bus and slapped the seat for my friend to sit down and a cloud blew into his eyes and he spent 10 minutes cleaning out his eyes.
I saw one of those parasites at boy scout camp once. I crushed it with a rock and dumped a glob of hand sanitizer on it
Instead of killing the children, send them to a island like you said in earlier videos so I can go and finally use my boy scout survival skills to kill every child and create a tribe to kill larger groups of children and we will become adults and be sent back to the real world and meet you
&quot;We start with the insects, we then take the children.&quot; My new life motto. Thank you Pewds.

Everyone was a kid at one point
33 lunar seconds is 15 mins
Zombie cricket
The clip with the old lady in the crazy wig looks like it was written and directed by David Lynch.
There are 24 hours in a day, each hour has 60 minutes and each minute has 60 seconds. So one second is 1/86400 of one day. Which mean that one &quot;lunar second&quot; is equal to approximately 27.3 earth seconds. 33 lunar seconds are therefore slightly above 15 earth minutes.
Why is pewdiepie from,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=645">10:45</a> It looks awful, but when you think about it a little... that spider is super tiny. Still it wouldn&#39;t see the light of day should I find it in mine. I kill spiders on sight.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=276">4:36</a> And that ladies and gentlemen is why our contry has such strict laws regarding pipe water.
Every week.....<br>Disgursting Shat...🤣🤣
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=650">10:50</a>, I had to check if there really was a spider in my earphones since I&#39;m wearing similar ones while watching this video. God that it awful.
children are the biggest environmental problem...<br>1. They add up to the total population (overpopulation)<br>2. When they grow up they usually want kids themselves<br>3. Overpopulation is the main source of all the consumerism that is poisoning the world... higher demand means higher production (of everything)<br>4. They think they are good a minecraft or fortnite but in fact they are not!<br>Man, i hate children XD
Ew gross, whose lip is that?
Why am I re-watching this right before bed
Pewdiepie: if I become a president or a leader I will ban all kids!!!!<br>9 year olds watching: Men vad i helvete säger han?
