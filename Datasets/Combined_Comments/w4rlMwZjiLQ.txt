<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=190">3:10</a> talking about Padmavat
The title should be renamed as ANUPAMA BLUSHING GUSHING OVER SRK&#39;S CHARM
He was offered Khilji&#39;s role in Padmavat movie. He denied it as people would start liking it if he plays it &amp; it&#39;s not a fictional character.
King Khan ♥💯

This feels more like a therapy session than an interview
I am a fan of his interviews &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; movies 🎉🎉

His wish comes true, the movie where he doesn&#39;t need to lead , Tiger 3 , pathaan, Dunki , where you could just see he will be acting and somebody else would be the leader ❤
Eventually he took a bigger break than Will Smith an came back with a bigger bangger than ever, and now he will continue to just entertain
It is all about Hindi Films, naturally for Hindi Audiance.....why in English ??
Shahrukh is the most amazing intelligent gentlemen. Whether it&#39;s romance or action, he is the best❤
Films don&#39;t change the world. People watch Get influenced for sometime and then forget. 😐
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=810">13:30</a> And then he went for a break and cameback with a hit. Pathaan
Can anyone be more grounded yet confident, so talented and intelligent, so self aware and a lil brash, all at the same time! This man is the epitome of all things attractive and inspiring! ❤❤❤ God Bless you Shah! Keep ruling! ❤❤❤
Srk❤❤❤❤
Which films do you think he left that were successes?
His interview is more realistic than many motivational speakers !
Pramod satpathy a child harasser must be jailed
What kind of nonsense question is that &quot; your film bring changes you wish that ?? .oh madam actors don&#39;t do any wish , they get characters ,they portrait the character on the screen that&#39;s. All
What a lovely conversation. Shahrukh is quite intuitive and Anupama has really intelligent thought provoking questions. Shahrukh has a calm energy. Someday I will have a nice heart warming thought provoking intelligent conversation with you Shahrukh. And with you too Anupama, I love your work. And I don&#39;t know why Fan didn&#39;t work but I absolutely loved the movie.
His own &quot;time off&quot; is making history and  records.
Fan really deserved to be a blockbuster 😔😔😔
the way how SRK talks in English with appropriate accent and grammar , perhaps no any other hero of Bollywood could talk such way,  King Khan is really the most learned and groomed hero of Bollywood !
Over smiling of girl make me boring
Will  smith didn’t hit a ceiling, he hit a rock.
PATHAAAAN 💕💕💕💕💕
Brahmastra finally let him have a movie that wasn&#39;t about him.
I watched his interview because I want to improve my communication skills
Being a die hard fan of SRK(i started liking him when i was 10 years old), i just wanted to have a meaningful conversation with him.
This man is beyond words...a truly magician in real life and Bollywood ❤️❤️
sounds arrogant
Danke!
Handsome and confidence 👍👌❤️. Real personality. Cool👍
I just love him
The halo effect of SRK: this coming from<br>A huge fan. Anupama has no bones to pick with SRK if he decides to work with younger girls, but had a big issue when Sara Ali Khan and Akshay Kumar seemed like they were a pair in Atrangi Re. I hope SRK does work with actresses his age now that they’re all coming back to do more work. He actually looks better with them than the younger lot.
Thanks Shahrukh Khan g.... the most admirable hero in Bollywood
Love ❤
Both are useless mentally
His communication skills .... 🥰
SRK.. If you don&#39;t like his acting, that&#39;s cool. But you cannot not admire his brilliant mind and his sharp wit. Anupama, with SRK, even you giggle!! :D &lt;3
As if I didn&#39;t love him already that I watched another masterpiece view into his thoughts , views and mind :))
Srk you are the 👑 ❤️

Life is a Wonderful Opportunity And An Amazing <a href="http://journey.it/">Journey.It</a> must be Appreciated And Celebrated Happily Hopefully And Abundantly
I love this guy. And, yes we have all seen him overdo the humility thing, to compensate for all that. Sometimes, it even becomes annoying seeing him thank so many people at the awards shows and being so so courteous everywhere. He can do it but it is insane that he does it even after being Shah Rukh Khan. But, then you realise that it becomes just as more relevant... doing what he does after being what he is and the fact that he understands this and does it anyway, makes you love him even more. God bless you, Khan sahab!! 👑 ❤ 😇☺
Hi
Srk ap itne ache kaise ho
Shahrukh is very arrogant guy who calls him a superstar.Look at akshay,he never takes his superstar tag very seriously and very grounded.Learn from him
Forever bae 😍😍😍 SRK gets better with age ❤️❤️
I&#39;ll be honest I&#39;ve watched it many times, but it&#39;s always so pleasant to hear him, see him talking he&#39;s soo genuine!!!
SRK man, He made Anupama laugh like hell in the end.
❤️❤️
Very educated superstar srk <br>Baki sab to chapri wala topi chasma pahan k kahi bhi shuru ho jate hai rap bolna🤣
Total farji h
Love this interview, very interesting and sincere.
The greatness comes from his ability to keep on growing! Every person tries to grow but isn’t really able to do it as successfully as this man! That’s what separates him from the rest of the world…he is beautiful and it is a therapy to listen to him! People who get to have in length conversations with him are lucky!
I just feel lucky to have been born during the era of ShahRukh Khan….the level of beauty as a person this man has is unmatchable❤️
great interview! SRK is such great personality to listen to! even though I expected better sound from this video, I&#39;m still very happy with this video! Film Companion never fails to give out great content.
The ending says ir all, on why is the King of bollywood. You need to be destined with goodness of everything that makes up this world.
❤️.
Shah rukh should act in more down to earth movies and unleash his acting skills completely 🥰
Nice interview .
A kind of charm in him rarely seen in any other actor in the world. SRK is god not very much as an actor but as an individual, such depth of understanding &amp; such expression. Anybody who listens to him will straight away fall in love , im sure about that.
SRK is exceptionally charismatic ❤️❤️❤️❤️
oh God how can a  man be so good orator
Srk❤️
The one who can answer your question with intelligence.. More than an actor he is a great human being.. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kingkhan">#KingKhan</a>❤️
I feel he is brutally honest on camera and tells what he feel with so much ease.
Shahrukh is my favourite❤
Anupama is fangirling so hard
Sharukh khan is such a humble intelligent and genuine man. I totally respect and honour him. God bless him and his family.... 🙏
You can retire now.... his wit🤣❤
This was really good.
He overthinks the idea about how much influence his movies will have..and that what ruins it...no one going to go away thinking I need to be that bad guy..they will think what a movie and srk is the man. I wonder how that less softer version would of been..could of been a gangs of waseppur type of feel.
Her face always lights up whenever she interviews Srk.. She turns into a young girl, seems like she&#39;s got a crush on Srk!! 😀😁
SRK 🤩
Srk is one of the best orators/speakers in India..definitely in India&#39;s top 3 alongside Shashi tharoor n all..
Perumale thunai nga!
God said nga promise nga!!!!

Proud to be a SRKian.. This man never cease to amaze Me with his intelligence &amp; witty answer&#39;s.... Can listen him forever... The humbleness in his words &amp; his attitude towards others is what makes him better than any other stars in the world... He always make sure that the person sitting in front of him be comfortable... And his smile😍😍 is definitely to die for.<br>Love you Shahrukh sir❣️❣️
His brain is a book!
Anupama accidentally confessed she wants baniye ka dimaag
DDLJ ruined him. He was experimenting with his craft so much before that. Was dishing out such sincere and impressive performances.<br>Post DDLJ, he stopped getting such roles and was wrongly stereotyped as a &quot;romantic hero&quot;.<br>Swades being flop just made it worse.
Hope u get more  perspective of life
🤦‍♂️
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=1297">21:37</a> - “this is your 3rd interview, you’ve arrived” is probably the most savage thing said with a smiling face. Dayum, ONLy SRK. <br>Take a bow King !! 😂😂
He took a break like Will Smith 😌
Just imagine film industry without SRK.
Ok fine i shall leave nga!
He&#39;s great.
BESIDES LOVING HIM AS A HOST I JUST LOVE HIM AS AN ORRATOR!!!!
He is so intelligent and charming with such a great sense of humor
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=330">5:30</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=1050">17:30</a>
King Khan SrK 🔥❤️🔥
Srk&#39;s Voice Is Like Expensive Whisky ♥️
Can listen to this intelligent man for hours and not get bored
Sarukan fu.....off form iam  tamil nadu😂
Pls bring him in for one more interview ...
Whatever he’s talking at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=650">10:50</a>. That’s what he’s doing rn, taking a break to come back better
The problem with Indian Stars is they have to think twice before delivering something which erupts from the bottom of their heart as there are some silly fans and toxic media which will divert the actual sense they made.. like will smith said he felt like he hit the ceiling of his talent and he said it because he felt so whereas Indian star can’t quote anything like that because people will start bullshitting about the statement that he lost the creativity and stuff
Says he doesn&#39;t believe in taking breaks. Does so immediately from next year. Life can truly be humbling. Come back stronger King! 😭😭😭
I admire I adore and I love srk not just because he is just an actor but he is genuinely a man who fits in every role and does it so smoothly. Anyone can become an actor but the man who can control our emotions just by his presence in the screen is the real magic man.
His acting in Devdas was at another level.  Real good.
Anupama chopra is 54 ... And she still look so young and beautiful
He is so talented 😍
SRK, forever ❤️
King Khan leads from the front for he’s the true Lion King……. The greatest of all time …
Movies are for entertainment. Postal services are for messages. Lol
Its just this life. Can’t even get to meet king khan in real life is a huge disappointment. Loved him since 1992 and still in love with the greatest Megastar of all time. Its not fair. I dreamed of playing in a movie with him, growing up. But the reality of life is something else. And it hurts that forget being his costar, I won’t be even able to meet him in this lifetime. But then I console myself with his very iconic and famous lines, “agar kisi chis ko shidhat se chaho, to pudi qayanat tumse milane ke koshish mein lag jate hai…” so I still hope…… that may be someday… one fine day….. let’s see! 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
suffering from success
Biggest fan of you Shah Rukh Sir. Lots of love, respect and gratitude
Fangirl anupama trying too hard for some eyecontact...
Its sure Hollywood should come down to  Mumbai just for srk...srk...srk.
Why this fake accent?
he doesn&#39;t agree with Will Smith and then he took 2 years Gap......he needs to change with the time..romantic NRI roles wont work now....TIME Keeps moving...
Tbh I really really liked FAN and Raees. They are such underrated movies. Shah Rukh Khan acted phenomenally in both and the characters are so special and diff , the plot the storyline was so unique and interesting. What do people even like now. The same old rom com action thrillers?<br>Even tho zero was messed up in the second half but the concept was so unique. If we don&#39;t appreciate such stories and concepts then we&#39;ll always be stuck in the same old genre of romance and action. We as audience should be more open towards choices. <br>Applauds for SRK to experiment diff genres and roles. God bless him ❤❤
Shah Rukh Khan is the most well spoken, wise and intelligent man. His personality is so charismatic  and his aura is so fiercy and huge. Can make anyone fall for him. He&#39;s witty and got a great sense of humour with the right presence of mind. Honestly  he&#39;s one of a kind. A phenomenal actor and a great human being. The King for a reason. <br>God bless him ❤❤
Bollywood legend 😍😘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23indianking">#indianking</a>
I am so proud of this man!
Wow. Far real than what I considered him to be. He explained stardom in the best possible manner<br>Well, I don&#39;t know about saawariya when om shanti om released. Let alone the same release date
&quot;there is a bad guy doing but things but he&#39;s making it so sexy that we&#39;re all rooting for him.&quot; never have truer words been spoken about Raees <b>*g*</b>
Very good to see srk talking about will Smith<br>Iron Man Robert Downey Jr<br>And Sunil Gavaskar ❤️✨🖤
Don is really sweet<br>I was sad when in the first movie Don died cause I don&#39;t wanna see Vijay, I wanted Don<br>Glad to say, I wasn&#39;t dissapointed
SRK can be a GREAT ANTI-HERO<br>Eg) Don, Don 2, Baazigar, Darr(a stretch but still)
Raees was great with Mahira, still love zaalima !
First <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=100">1:40</a> mins srk successfully roasted anupama chopra

I especially come back again and again to watch his interviews. <br>I think there is a separate fan club just for his interviews and I am a consistent fan of that club😄<br>Brilliant man💐
He perhaps requires a filmaker like Martin Scorsese

Anupoma: Do you think that your movie bring changes? <br>Sharukh khan: Its like a book. I read a book that doesnt mean the world will be changed now, but it makes a discussion... <br>( My heart gets locked after getting such intellectual answer frm Shahrukh khan)
SHAH Rukh Khan wonderful actor 😀👍
Yeah, he did act like an arrogant jerk during OSO and Sawariya clash. But anyway, oso was a better film. And srk is , was and always will be 💞🔥👏🤩🥰
He literally is the wittiest person ever in bollywood

I just hate him he n Shahid insulted shushant Singh Rajput in an award function see the karma will give them back so hard he was beautiful soul n innocent
Srk is always trying to be himself which is so sweet. He has a way with words where you can just hear him talk all day and still not get tired🙌🏼 You will always learn something when listening to his talks Masha’Allah. I love Anupama’s interviews with Srk because they are all so delightful to watch. She knows how to take great interviews.
Hater always comments down below
Actually in ki zaida tar films pakistani Dekhty tha but jab se pakistan me indian films ban hoye ha in ko projects nahi milte
<b>SRK IS THE HUMBLEST, EARNEST, CLEANEST, SWEETEST, SMARTEST, FUNNIEST, FRANKEST, STAR I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! AND EVERY COMPLIMENT ON THIS EARTH GOES TO HIM!!!! HE IS JUST FAB!!!!</b> .....and if I keep writing, this comment will never end!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰
Sari sablok bohot accha hai
Srk fans in the comments section - abe galat kon bola be😡😡😡!!!😂
I liked the video in the start itself, the zaalima song and the cute srk
My fav❤🌍
Did everyone forget about DON , where he was a bad guy...
Human with intellectuality
He is just love the way he explains with full cuteness hotness and his fluent english there will be no one like him
I like it when two people &quot;who know their job&quot;talk!👍
Shah Rukh Khan is not a good actor but he is an intelligent man. If he used that intelligence in his selection of movies, he would have been one of the best actors of India
I respect you a lot Shah Rukh Khan ji
Sushant literally copied shahrukh khan. He was true admirer
The SHAH RUKH KHAN Said He has a Soft corner for everyone who works around him....loved it
whenever Anupama have an interview with SRK, , she somehow turns out like a leading lady in SRK films who can exchange witty discussion with him and also showcase that very pretty and sweet smile. she has that heroin laugh too. 😊😊
He is saying it&#39;s James Bond type and she promptly responds let&#39;s say it&#39;s cartoonish SRK 😁😁 it&#39;s sweet
Saw this interview back then when it was posted... and watching it now again...!!! But the transition phase in 3 years has changed whole lot of perspective of looking towards life, that even this video seems different now from a back then one..!!!
👑THE MOST APPRECIATED LEGEND
Shahrukh Sir should work in Web Series. Don&#39;t know why he is creating many web series under Red Chillies Banner but not acting in it. We want to see u, sir do something like Yeh Meri Family it will suit u more cause u can&#39;t use abusing words.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=1027">17:07</a> I love it 😂😋💜❤️💗
Amazing!
Bro those 4 self questions in the beginning were on point. Ahahah. Srk is a g
Iam not a great fan of Shahrukh as an actor<br>But he is witty and Anupama seems to be so silly with that fake Laughter 😂😂
He is king😈💜💜💜
❤️❤️❤️
Why does this woman laugh so much and so unnecessarily and in such a fake way. Shut up and be serious and professional.
Shahrukh khan&#39;s English is next level.
For me iq is srk  though his recents not much succeeded but his acting was same as legendry 😍😍😊
Shah Rukh Khan you don&#39;t how much I love you
srk is like my own father he doesnt like talking too personal with his own daughter and gets shy my dad is like that but with less emotion and words
he is too nice for the world
He is so well spoken. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23srkianforever">#SRKianForever</a>
He is doing now. He has taken a break From Movies and It&#39;s more than 2 years. And last time he announced his movie was 4 years ago. He announced ZERO in 2016 Nov.
SRK in real life is more interesting to listen than in acting .  Such a gifted charmer he is!!!
Do even know who is Will Smith Ass Hole?
Oh myyy!I&#39;m so honored to be your fan for 18 years.I lived my childhood with your movies dady!I&#39;m in love with youuu!Mahsa always love you till she dies!you are such an amazing spirit with such an amazing lovely soul.
SRK
king of my heart❤️
😍
👌👌👌👌
He reached the top of his talent or not moving forward now. And he is been taking break since 2018, Zero movie. He lies about being shy and blush about swearing but he swore at wangade stadium at old security man who was only doing his duty and security guy was honest about his work. More power to people who still work with such honesty. Filmy stars lies and create image in interview and shows about being good persona. They do all drugs n womanizing. SRK used to throw IPL party where drinks, drugs and women are served. Arjun And Maher used to host for SRK. See his interview now.
U are the best ma sharukh ,❤
Anupama . Your laugh is bad and evil.. plz don&#39;t laugh while interviewing someone. Humble request.
What the hell happened to him? He looks sooo bad. He is not ageing gracefully....🙄
Go back pack
Faku maal
ماشاء الله
Khudki kaise lal karta hai?
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=142">2:22</a> srk saying he didnt do a film based on real character it must be Khilji of Padmaavat, he is saying it has done well at boxoffice but he is trying to confuse ppl so that we dont get it. There is no real life bad guy in a film which was successful in BO except padmaavat.
Love king shahrukh khan.
19 : 50 when kgf destroyed zero😂😂
Drug addict
The anchor seems so excited but shahrukh seemed in the state of nonchalant and all that.
The film &quot;FAN&quot; was AWESOME!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥👑👑👑👑
I had great respect for SRK . The way he insulted Sushant in award function...you lost  respect .your chuthiya
Whoever did Shahrukh&#39;s makeup in this video; really had a bad day....He/She ruined it for Shahrukh.
Anupama Chopra is a true journalist..always in form.. But in front on shahrukh, she&#39;s turned into a shy girl... Giggling all the time and all.. but SRK does have that effect on people,so don&#39;t blame her😂.. wish I could meet him Yaar!
🧡
He’s right we should do more round table interviews and try to understand how we can make their working experience better
Anu...atlast you talk about the characters from his films...not about him 😂😂🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🙈...what to do...its that wonderful journey where only Good Work,Good Art and being a Good and Bharatiya Human matters who had just put Smiles nothing much and that is HUGE..... hopingly... now..atleast.... the whole Humanity will understand the value and the need of that.....He Is Always Good at his work...that proves and is what always inspires..... atleast me....  about being a good human being nd be at peace with my price of doing....Made my day...though again after 3 years...but He is just a ❤️....Thank You Anupama for the Aura u create around everyone..... Positive......🙏🏻
Imagine Sallu giving this level of interview. Impossible.
Haters plz don&#39;t watch his interviews as u would get to know him,,,leads to loose of your hate for him..
Shahrukh khan and Ranbir kapoor<br>Both are very good actors with great communication skills...Go and watch Ranbir -Anupama video ...It&#39;s a tough battle between two intellectuals (RK-SRK) talking about acting process and film making...
you can listen to this man lifelong
He took the break ...irony is what he never believed in now doing the same😅<br>But I really want him to bounce back with a bang ❤️❤️
What is srk wearing can anyone tell me that ?
She laughs so loud, that she is interrupting the talk.
Hi shah Rukh... I have a wish in my life. Tat I want to c u. I don&#39;t know tat how could I express.... Tat much I love you Shah Rukh... You are a legend. God bless you n family. Love you Shah Rukh.
His interview is more entraining than race 3
Irritating ufff. Narcissism at it&#39;s best. Uggghh
This man is a gem. Man ur truly awesome 👍👍👍

Is harami ko ku bulaya tumne tum pagal ho ky sala mhullla kutta kami a
wait a second shahrukh khan played a bad guy in DON series as well
You should get retired and give chance to the new youngster like shusant sing rajput. <br>Justice for shusant...
Don is a every excellent movie. He every kool. And some of it real. And don fits srk.
Love you srk 🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮
Kingg👑khann❤❤❤
Jaaa pakistan phut bc...bhale kitna bhi bada superstar hai...hattt mc
How interesting and talented is this guy 😍😍😍
Such a sensible person he&#39;s nd a good human being..I just listening his words like a sweet..cz he&#39;s so sweet... proud to be a fan of shaH siR ❣️ 😘
Ra&#39;s Al Ghul anyone?
SRK IS VERY HUMBLE BUT HE LOVE ACTING AND IT A PART OF HIM. LISTENING TO HIM SAYS THAT HE LOVE ACTING AND IT&#39;S REALLY APART OF THE PERSON HE IS.  THE HARDEST PERSON ON HIMSELF IS HIMSELF.
SRK CAN PLAY ANY ROLE. DON IS VERY GOOD.  AND SRK PLAYS IT VERY WELL. GOOD GUY BAD GUY HE PLAYS VERY WELL.
The whole bloody interview was over when she said &quot; I promise you not to ask you any of these&quot;. I wish she could reply &quot; the interview is over, go home Mr. Superstar, bye bye&quot; instead of saying what she said. This whole interview is a repetitive and clumsy except for what Shah Rukh said about the questions he doesn&#39;t want to be asked....very clever but than he shat himself all over. making a bad guy attractive.... what the hell has attractiveness got to do with good or bad...bat shit crazy nonsense.
Shahrukh is one of d finest orator..i mean he uses each n every single word with so much conscious n with so powerful impact.I just feel like listening him over again n again n never get bored of his interviews n speeches.He is a great human being with a great soul.Truly the king of bollywood n king of d earth.He is so generous n so humble that one feels to be like him.I just love SRK n he is truly marvellous n a great legend.
I&#39;m so starved of SRK on screen. Love him so much.
Now he took time off.. lol .. how things changed
As correctly Malayalam actress Parvathi spoke usually Indian movies glorify bad guys on screen they present that way, other industries like Hollywood example Joker show this is how joker is or the bad guy is .. that&#39;s really a difference
I love u .....
He should actually do character driven roles what he doesn&#39;t realize is that girls too now want acting...we are a netflix and web series generation...it worked amazingly well for saif aftee sacred games...it will work beautifully with srk if he puts in work
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=1119">18:39</a> 😂🤣
There are ppl who criticise srk as being too much indulge into fame. But actually he is not. He is a good actor , he has done lot of hardwork and he appreciate and praise brilliant actors like irfan sir n nawaz uddin. He is humble enough to accept that. And above all I think he is more intelligent n witty than most if the bollywood actors.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=202">3:22</a> (ye maine kabhi nhi socha....jabki mai human behavior pe zyade videos dekhta hu....padhta hu)<br>Shah Rukh Khan agar koyi kitaab likhe to sab se pehle mai hi khreedunga!
SRK didn&#39;t really come out from Bazigor, Dorr, DDLJ. Basically he had nothing many more out of them. That time industry people didn&#39;t value much Aamir and Salmaan except this kkkkkkk Guy. But Aamir and Salmaan are Phoenix bird. They are much much independent. SRK always needs and liked to be surrounded by flattered people. He can&#39;t live without praise. Everywhere he has weird and strange sort of attention seeking attitude.  He never sounds like a man.
IRONY of SRK talks.. He has basically  gone and done things in REAL life that he said he wouldn&#39;t like to do 😁  am watching this interviews because I simply LOVE utterly butterly delicious KingKhan  😋😜plus it&#39;s Lockdown due to Covid-19 so Stay at Home n my main time pass anything SRK;-)   .. I would really want AnupamaChopra re-interview SRK very soon and point out to him all this interview statements which he said he wouldn&#39;t do or follow in real life but he actually did ........ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23filmcompanion">#FilmCompanion</a> Someone please tell SRK not to feel burdened by the films he does, by getting over involved in the films process,, instead just do you part as an Actor like you used to do earlier with your hit successful films..  For this start by selecting the right scripts enough of all these dodgy, Emotionless , half baked stories .
Aby Hindi Mai bol ly kro Kuch begad jy GA kya
how he treats women and people around him..and his hospitality, business mind, dressing, and offcrse greatest actor of all time..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTBT68XHu58">https://youtu.be/XTBT68XHu58</a><br>Wow ... Awesome 😊😊<br>Love you maa
Confused anupama chopra w anupama kher
This man is pure diamond! 😘
Im a cinema specialist .Baazigar is phenomenal.
Like his interviews more then his movies
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=855">14:15</a> laurraaaa lag gaya na?? break nai le g?? do saal ho gaye hain abhi koi picture nai hai isk paas, itne barray bol nai bolnay chaiye insaan ko
Shahrukh khan is such an interesting guy off screen
I feel if kabir singh was played by SRK , it would have received huge appreciation from Anupama only because SRK could have explained and justified the movie so beautifully 🤔
His interviews are way better than Selmon bhoi&#39;s films
The only man who can seduce a woman with his intellect only ,, despite having the look n i swear I&#39;m a straight guy
😉😉😉
Notice he talks about reading no wonder why he is so well spoken.
Such a annoying laugh
Why is she so annoying
he is a good actor and Fan is a good movie . SRK is really sweet ,intelligent, well spoken
Good interview
Expecting better movies from shah rukh sir during comeback not those shitty ones like happy new year, jhms, zero
I love you and so does my daughter.
Now that he has removed all the bad films out of his system, and has also taken a kind of a break. <br>We can expect him to come back and break the box office again.
What scene he is talking about? (of Fan)
I admire his intellect and how well spoken he is.
@caesar k - Ur comment is like - If u don&#39;t like Modi, why do you see him speaking. Both the guys don&#39;t talk complete meaningful or completely meaningless.... It&#39;s our intellect how we perceive their speech/ interview &amp; take the positive things positively
cool guy
I think the movie is &#39;once upon a time in mumbai&#39;
I&#39;m first time watching Shahrukh Khan&#39;s interview, and it&#39;s amazing
he is so smart, still makes shitty movies...tells us we need emotional iq along with normal iq
He talks very spontaneously and with a lot of conviction...something that not most stars are capable of!!!
Please ask some to akhsay Kumar that films are for interanmant not for msg all time
Raees is mafia story. The lifestyle is &quot;real&quot; but the character Raees isn&#39;t real so I get what he means
i remember a scene from movie deewana where he sort of confesses in front of his friends that I&#39;ve fallen in love with this girl that particular performence he did my god.
Release his interviews instead of films
Stop background sounds its irritating me
The interviewer&#39;s laughter is horrible and distracting
He is becoming rubbish very fast.
Sir we all love you.
🙏 God bless you and your family sir
Another albert einstein
I love you today, tommorow and always. Your always my good guy
I feel so bad that some of his movies didn&#39;t do well. Like Fan, Dilwale, and even Zero. I watched Zero, and I&#39;m not gonna lie, people were overreacting. Its not an awful film. Its obviously isn&#39;t DDLJ or like his acting in Kal Ho Naa Ho, but I really feel like it could have done better.
After 2 years srk take Mr smith advise<br>Take a break
Wow.. amazing interview..
I thought Fan was a great movie, I really liked it
His knowledge,is the best Achievement of all!❤️
what an irony....finally srk took break for a year to sign a movie..same as will Smith..no one knows about the future....SRk interview is better than many star movies 😅
You laugh at salman&#39;s IQ. He will laugh on your bank balance😎
.hallo
You are overlaughing lady
You are right khan in your comment,you say he is from another world beautiful one, and in India people do not deserve such a man ,they do not appreciate good actor  Mashallah bless him and his family and those who believe his ability .
What an amazing actor and an intelligent person! I don&#39;t understand how FAN was not appreciated. It was a wonderful film and his performance was amazing!
So how’s it taking a break now?
pehle chat le shahrukh ki den interview lena
Don was Best Role done by Srk 😊
Nawaz and pankaj interviews has more viewrs than this even this was released 1 year ago than those ,this show his popularity level among youngster I think they are more down to earth then him
This man has just another level of confidence,wit,guts and IQ....
Srk should be the pm
Amazed 💖
Srk and director of raees are fraud.. <br>He showed latif as good criminal..  Actually  he was very cruel and baster..
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVEEEEEEEEEEE U SRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love Shah Rukh but he has had a nose job....just an observation before u guys pile on, remember I’m one of his biggest fans
♥️♥️♥️
Badshah of Bollywood
Class personified shahrukh khan <br>Love him sal no class man should take notes on how to speak
I respect SRK so much, even though I am from another country from Turkey. If you are Indian, you do not have to love SRK or anyone but you should be respect and proud and grateful of SRK or who is hard working and trying more. I think you should respect his contribution and should appreciate the innovations his bring to develop India and education and foundation and Hindi Cinema etc. Because I think he is the one of the best-bigest the value and culture brand of India. And this video or many similar videos prove that. I keep watching SRK&#39;s speeches, interviews and kind of spiritual talks. I&#39;m taking a lot of advice and learning English from his conversations. I like his speeches or hosts or his humorous persona more than his some of films. I should say even now I can&#39;t understand how and why his performances in &quot;Fan and Zero Movie&quot; were not liked and appreciated? They were one of the best. You don&#39;t like or can hate movies. It is normal. But his performences and techniques he uses were like one of the best Hollywood&#39;s performences he did it, I think. This is different. So I don&#39;t know...
Love you srk! 😍
Srk
We don&#39;t deserve you sir ! Perfection to another level...
It seems now you are following will smith&#39; s advice..taking break.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wemisssrkonbigscreen">#WeMissSrkOnBigScreen</a>
These film critics should have some shame..... Fools interviewing worldclass superstars.....
Wow,<br>Ultimate ENTP In Action.<br>Love To The King Actor Of India.
Here after watching Sandeep Reddy interview, here Anupama herslef is glorifying ShahRukh Khan&#39;s Raees character of a bootlegger saying it looks sexy and wants to make us being a bootlegger, and also agreeing with ShahRukh on that in the end a film is there for entertainment. I mean if thats not the hypocrisy than what is? She talks so much about constantly bashing the star system in bollywood from time to time but here just because she is a long time Srk fan and he is the biggest star in the world, she is holding up to him and his films on different standards. I think as an interviewer she is great but her and her channels reviews are biased, hypocrite, and cheat at the core of it. peace!
Srk hindi
So much to learn .. u r the greatest superstar
srk❤💋
This man is so inspiring and real.. If he is bestowed with the honour of being called the king of bollywood then he has truly earned it and he deserves it. He is a superstar.
Srk ❤️
Shahrukh khan ek hai or ek hi rahega
Don is not cartoonish, fiction means not real, this woman is growing just too irritating, self-proclaimed movie critic, journo. <br>SRK - you&#39;re lost, the movie is not led by you unless the story demands it like Dear Zindagi, audience madness has made you loose touch with reality. You should be bad guy like Saif in Race, you in Baazigar with a hint of goodness, do real movies, remember Chak De? Romance sells still, will always...just dont repeat DDLJ, hands flying style, get new flavor. The more relatable, the better it is...else superhero of India like Bahubali (of course not you as bahubali) or contemporary superhero, not Hollywood copy. However, stop doing comic-romance...Zero, Dilwale, Chennai Express..just too much...come back to serious movies. SRK, SK think just too much of themselves..making crew wait for hours just coz you want them to is SICK, but when fans roll themselves over on road in front of their idols, it is natural to think like that..at least he acknowledges that, unlike SK. People are to be blamed for making their idols act like shithead.
Anupama chopra got scared after askings questions to king😂
India speak hindi ,I am hearing hindi enjoy,,seeing more India hindi ,interview
Scope limited ACTOR.
He&#39;s beard so perfect...
He is veryy talented
love you srk
Srk has the best humour......well done by Anupama chopra too
Buaa is the best “ love u king
I love u king khan
King of Bollywood
why she is fucking laughing for no reasons like judge of comedy show.
SRK is protective father about his children like all fathers in the World
So charming my favourite actor in the World  no one can take your place in my heart
The most complex machine in the world----&gt; SRK&#39;s mind !!
I agree movies in general are more for entertaining but some can make you think depending on the topic.  Bollywood movies has made me more curious about the Indian culture.  I think that is a positive thing.  The other topic they discussed &#39;going through the motions&#39; I believe it happens to most of who work whether it is acting or serving as a waiter.  There are few fortunate people the love what they do every single day of their lives.  Sometimes you just don&#39;t feel like working but you do it because you have to.  You know?
raees movie is fraud..  director is fraud and srk as well, they showed latif as good hearted man.. he was not, he killed 19 odd ppl at amdabad hindugymkhana at a time. just to kill one he killed 19. many more incidents.
Such a God gifted person
SRK😍
☮️❤️🌈🍀.<br>Thank you for making and uploading this media,:).<br>Hearty Regards,<br>☮️❤️🌈🍀.
Still one of my most favorite interviews by Film Companion in the last two years! Shah Rukh is incredible to listen to
👍
What an endearing interview and that honesty in srk&#39;s eyes
Anupamaji omg you should have sent some one else. You are in love with this guy like rest of us! Your eyes r like twinkling and the smile never goes away....oof I get the same heat up feeling. Alas!!
Until shah rukh does character driven films which he said that he would not since girls are still finding him sexy his movies are not gonna be success in box office anymore...And he is having a very wrong notion that girls are still finding him sexy in romantic roles with 25 ,26 , 30 years aged heroines opposite to him while himself being 52 years of age..Just too much of a wrong notion he is having and that is very clearly reflecting in the box office collections since chennai express to harry met sejal ,none doing well at box office at all...He must be back to doing character driven roles like that in chak de,swades,devdas otherwise his movies will fade away more,the decline has already started since chennai express it&#39;s high time for him to shift tp character driven roles...His recent selection Of movies  has been a quite poor and his acting has become too much predictable
does he have hina on his nails?
SRK thanks for existing
comnt aftr first 5 min...srk saying raees was study of that research of that bla bla...but the film was nothing new camera work similar to gow, bond 007 nawaz was continuing his role from kahaani, the story was no way sexy just some attractive dialogue. farhan is not the same farhan, excel has lost its track
Forgot hater&#39;s king Khan Sir we love you and our idol ur number one
He is way too spontaneous in interview
&quot;King&quot; Øf acting ka baap Srk world biggest globel megastar Srk
One of the most intelligent actors of Bollywood it&#39;s always a pleasure hearing him speak
When srk speaks he only speaks . No other actor can speak like him. He is legend in all the areas
Huge star!!! 💫
Subdue enemy without fighting
As a main stream actor  only and only he can play bad role as great as good role only Bollywood &quot;actor&quot;
Hate SRK Or LOVE SRK. It&#39;s your choice. still he is the biggest superstar in the world.
Ahhh! Photo frames in the background are disturbing.... please align them properly.
💖💞SRK😍💕😍💕😍💕😍💕😍💕
Mr. Khan, your fingernails look gold plated. Is that the lighting or the megalomaniac in you?
For some reason, I&#39;m not annoyed when she cracks up at the jokes. Subconciously it&#39;s cute for me i guess
Ohhh man he is so real and so inspiring.....there is lot to learn from him.....I feel proud to be a die heart srk fan😍
I think SRK Is talking about Munnabhai MBBS
The biggest fan of srk.....just because of his control over the language....whenever he speaks and i listen to him I enjoy like being in spa.....lagta hai koi dard tha aur main dawa ki khurak le raha hu aur behtar hota ja raha hun....<br><br>Something seriously wrong with you guys if srk doesn&#39;t impress you....
If a Superstar says I have problem in swearing on screen,<br>Director with the whole team change the script while a newcomer specially an outsider says that he will not swear. With in a sec he will be replaced. <br>That’s how this industry works.
I wish bhakts were educated enough to see and understand that Srk never glorifies bad guys on screen !!
Yeah right ! We were rooting for Thanos even though he was abad guy because be was sexy...kuch bhi??
Srk u should do more negative characters
Anupama you are cuteee and aduring 😘😘😍<br>Talented &amp; sensible toh no doubt 😄
Most intelligent witty actor of bollywood ...<br>SRK for you
I dont know what to say about srk he is really an inspiration for me
So just to get the bad walls(read bad movies)out of your system u did movies like HNY,Dilwaale,Raees,fan etc etc P.S-please get them out of ur system ASAP we r badly missing The SRK who did movies like My Name is Khan,Chak de India,Swades,Veer zaara even Dear Zindagi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meF8B8udPHs">https://youtu.be/meF8B8udPHs</a>
Came after AIB Podcast
Just handsome❤❤
I was just watching srk all the time<br>He&#39;s so handsome &amp; charming 😸
PR does a great job before interview fueling new stuff to make it more interesting. Nothing new. Too Boring.
Did Shahrukh have a fight with his wife before this interview?? Who pulled his hair and messed it all up??
I jst love this man..... Love u shahrukh
I hope he will become a true actor one day like Nawaz and Manoj bajpayee and will be able to say Dusht and kutta easily.
Should retire now. Too boring to be watched. But but, unmatched wit is &lt;3
The Bad Guy he is talking about is Allauddin Khilji from &quot;Padmaavat&quot;
He has got talky eyes 👀 so many untold stories he kooks really sad but some smile he keeps in his eyes made him king of acting ..i love ❤️ you
Take one interview wid our Sunny pajji im missing him
Love You SRK, too good interview, would have little more longer, importantly question about suhana answered very diplomatically. Enjoyed watching you &amp; i must say enjoyed watching anupama. Cheers
Om shanti om is like my favorite movie
He is so well read..his vocabulary shows it..every answer of his in this interview was fantastic..
Waqt aatey toh bht dekha jatey hua pehli bar dekh ra hu sharukh is an example of a star exploding into pieces but banda bht humble ha pata ha usko time aagya ha but phr b.... Paise bht ha aab koi tention nhee to fight with young stars
LOVE UUUU SRK <br>my childhood crush
He’s the only Khan well recognized here in the states , they also respect a lot more in the west  because out of the 3 big Khans , he was the only one who started up from nothing
📼      I just won an iPhone X on this giveaway. Hurry up there is few more left! <a href="http://app2win.ml/h4__d">http://app2win.ml/h4__d</a>
What a beautifully boring interview&#39;...
this scumbag is so full of himself
This guy is one of the worst and most overrated over actor in the world. His performance in that idiotic my name is Khan is beyond horrible, it is comically horrible.
Love SRK to the moon and back! But, he should fire the person who did his makeup here! His lips are pink and glossy!
Srk what can I say for you , you get so many complements.I m thankful to God that you are part of Indian film industry May God bless you always Hope to see you some day
I saw Raees 11 times love u ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg his voice and his look so sexy love you SRK I am praying I could hug you once ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love you SRK ❤️❤️❤️❤️
worst sense of humor exchanged, sorry not sure why you both are laughing cause those jokes were cracking sounded idiotic
GORGEOUS...♡♡♡♡♡
Shahrukh is so charming!! So inspiring!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=170">2:50</a>, definitely talking about Dev in Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=196">3:16</a> SRK pronounced  the word wrong its not &quot;PENCHANT&quot; although it looks like because of the spelling .....the word is pronounced as &quot;Pasha&quot; means habitual liking. ......sorry I am not showing off.
anupoma chopra help us be witch.
east west saab oor my brother sharukh is the best. vaia.
Movies are for entertainment and postal services are for messages :D
Don&#39;t worry, La La Land is still the villain. Manish Sharma is a great director! It was a Bollywood thriller. BOLLYWOOD THRILLER 😍
I haven&#39;t seen Saawariya yet..... but Om Shanti Om is nice.
I like your list
Don&#39;t mention Picasso, he cut his ear off to stay inspired <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23notarolemodel">#NotARoleModel</a>
I thought you were the good guy in Raees...
What a well spoken, intelligent man. He deserves every bit of adulation and appreciation he gets.
Amazing session! I have always &quot;liked&quot; SRK as an actor but given a chance I would rather watch a real actors&#39;s film which in my mind SRK and Amitabh are not! That said, I love these 2 gentlemen because of how the behave in public, how they speak in their interviews and how they communicate their thoughts with utter simplicity yet laced with oodles of wit and honestly. I just love that about SRK and Amitabh. I may not go watch thier movies in the cinemas but I will stop at every video here on YouTube to listen to what they have to say. I feel smart and proud listening to them. Strange na?  Thank you Anupama! And, thank you ShahRukh! So we have 9 more interviews to look forward to? 1 every month right? Heh heh!
she should uphold the decorum of the interviewer<br>they way this interview conducted looked like some school girl going crazy with an overrated star by asking questions which has no revelance
lots of
I cannot believe Fan was so underappreciated. It was so sweet and sad - what Shah Rukh said about Manish. <br>He really felt the loss/failure of Fan, I think. There was no reason for that movie to have not done well.
I like his interviews more than his movies. Maybe he should just do interviews...😂

Superb interview Anupama Chopra you are amazing and what can we say about Srk he is a genius.
wish srk does more of darker, grittier, character driven roles more &amp; more. pls avoid toilet standard movies like dilwale and happy new year
old.song
U shud INTERVIEW DULQUER SALMAN
which movies he was talking about which he left in the last moment
I love this interview
I love srk
Film Companion Please give us an interview of Vidya Balan and Kangana Ranaut ..
Education shows , A truly inspirational person . I may not be his huge fan , But I like the person who he comes across through the interviews .
so what about Don? wasnt that a charming bad guy and a &quot;new&quot; movie of him? how is raees any diffrent in presenting the image of a bad guy sexy? xD
this women laugh to much harshly my ears becomes bleed
I wish SRK would do a movie where the premise was basically him giving interviews. Like a Curb Your Enthusiasm meets Truman Show. SO MUCH I love to hear SRK speak, whatever his movies might end up being eventually, I shall always want SRK to remain around.
Round tables are overrated !!!
how do outsiders tell their stories
SRK and his sense of humor.. doesn&#39;t get any better.. n anupama is really a star now 😝
Why don&#39;t you call Aamir Khan in your show in-spite of Dangal being the biggest success of 2016 both critically and commercially
Movies r for entertainment &amp; postal services are for messages. Very well said sir
Anupama chopra is lame. Period
Anupama chopra is so lame. Period
Anupama chopra is so lame. Period
Anupama chopra is so lame. Period
Anupama can someone please teach SRK to construct shorter sentences in interviews? Each time, I am excited to watch his interviews, i cannot take his &quot;compound never ending long winding sentences!&quot; and have to drop off within few seconds...:)
Very nice
Srk is too big a star like Rajni he shud release he&#39;s movie n sit at home or take a holiday ask the producers to promote  rather waste time giving interviews to journalists
Love u SrK coz u only know how to throw shoes at someone with sugar coating only that person will feel the pain the rest will c the sweet sugar that has covered the shoes.
Raees rules box office and hearts all over the world!  Superb acting by Shahrukh and Nawazuddin. Dialogues amazing and will be remembered for many years.
Kaabil a superhit Raees lacks collection
my dear srk has gone old :( stop smoking for god shake
well i have a suggestion for shahrukh sir,...what if you spend hours to write a film for yourself..the film that you like...as i think you just dont fit at all,,, after yash raj died... i think you have the guts to write the best and perfect story... for yourself..Because the movies you are going to be a part, is just letting you down..in some way or the other. ..and, select the only script that makes you feel better or the one who you were some years ago,, and,,dont change yourself for the sake of other actors,,
Why everyone praising Anupama? Her laugh during interview seems bit inappropriate and disturbing. Laugh at right matter is good.
anupama you are very cute god bless you
Absolutely adore him, the way he speaks can listen to him for hours!

Absolutely loved the interview and as always SRK&#39;s choice of words.<br>The best part was that you (Anupama Chopra) still had questions to ask SRK inspite of him telling all possible questions he might be asked. that was a kicker... And shows how well @Anupama Chopra has prepared and knows her craft. Love you guys both and Look forward for more...
Excellent interview Anupama, really appreciate and thank you for all different set of questions !!!
Idont know what is the secret behind his change in his face and his character  in the past and now
you are fake ..stop being fake...and delhi wanna be..I can&#39;t say dog name in Hindi..and kaminey ..I mean seriously
holy fuck shahrukh nailed it with those first four questions 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He&#39;s just soooo HUMBLE
I freaking LOVE U SO MUCHHHHHH.....SO ORIGNAL

NOW , I ALSO WISH TO BE CALLED FOR A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION JUST LIKE MY <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23shahrukhkhan">#SHAHRUKHKHAN</a>
Anupama, why didn&#39;t you interview anyone from dangal team when dangal was about to release or just after?
good interview
He is really very pleasant to hear and also very inspirational.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rlMwZjiLQ&amp;t=1322">22:02</a> Dear Shar Rukh Sir just find good story  &amp; you in that movie believe rest all will fall more than any one can imagne
He&#39;s very very confident but never overconfident. Always real and candid.
hahahahaha the first 4 questions that was hilarious ! You can feel SRK answers the same things all day ^^ Anyway what does dusht mean ?
Don&#39;t like him in movies but think he is the only actor in Bollywood who sounds intellectual. Its always a pleasure hearing him speak.
Hmm, Raees is not based on a real guy? So, who was Latif, the mafia in Ahmedabad during 80s and 90s?
it&#39;s always a pleasure watching him 😍
everytime listen this wonderful man I get never bored
Anupama Chopra your loud , grunting laughter is bloody irritating. Stop it women. Be a lady. lower the volume . SRK your innuendos r really not necessary on every question. I rarely watch this stuff it was recommended by a friend. Adios!
saawariya was a good product? it was crap
This guy looks like a donkey with skin like suitcase leather!
This guy can&#39;t act and this interview shows how narcissist he is.
7 years ago?? It has been 10 years of Om Shaanti Om and Saawariya
Crazy in love with SRK
Way to promote your husband and Srk.. .. Why don&#39;t u put pics  of all the ppl he talks about during his interview? Salman?? Aamir? Alia? Rahul? Ritesh? Gauri? Karan? .. Haat sali anupamba.
Shahrukh, you&#39;ve become a coward actor,  you don&#39;t have guts to make movies like Dangal and Pink, you are happy with Chennai Express, Happy New Year, Dilwale, because you&#39;ve managed to fool the audiences and earn profits. 10-15 years from now no body will remember you for such movies. Your time is near.
This guy ❤ ! :)
Anupama Chopra.. you&#39;ve arrived. !!! ;)
Why SRK why this desperate Clash with HRITHIK? Despite being a good friend of him. Sad.<br>Good luck for ur movie though.
Very nice interview!!!  I Love FAN,Dilwale and Happy New Year. I love you SRK!!! You are the Best actor in the world.
last 10mins &lt;3 Srk so honest man
Anupama Chopra, &quot;7 years ago Sawariaya went against Om Shanti Om&quot;. That was 10 years ago.
Raees hazir hai
Hit like if you like SRK and don&#39;t understand how someone can actually hate him.
Why are people saying that Raees should be realistic? It&#39;s a MOVIE at the end of the day. It is suppose to have unrealistic elements too. Fan was without any songs and any lead heroine, and it was not accepted by most people in India especially. Movies can be realistic and also escapism cinema.
is this side of his life portrayed or is he real in any way he talks?
I think Anupama needs to start a roundtable series of her own..with all the actors, actresses, directors etc
❤❤❤ srk...!!!
niiice ! x
King of All Times ...
Shahrukh comb properly man! Hee he used to be a style icon ... very untidy
SHAHRUKH KHAN is now theeeeeee most FAMOUS MAN ON EARTH
+ Film Companion Anupama please fix the audio on your videos, the sound is bad and it echoes
He is the best overall. Nothing else touches this man
He just fucked up Rajeev Masand&#39;s Round Table Conference. HAHAHAH
Guys stop replying to those haters , we are making them top comments , srk is really the best bc he speaks from the heart and the funny thing is that they who are talking about honesty misunderstand him all the time , srkian 4 ever.
Bencho Maachis tow fuzool mein badnaam hai, logon ki tow Shah Rukh Khan ka naam sunn kar hi Jal Jaati hai!!  XD
I love salman, shahrukh and aamir they r so different from one another I don&#39;t know why people compare them
Shahrukh as an actor seems good to me but as a person he is way more intelligent than other Bollywood celebrity out there.
Wow... actually come to think of it, sanjay leela bhansali did get a sweet revenge when baajirao did great despite clashing with dilwale.... Just thought of it when anupama asked abt saawariya clashing with om shanti om.....Actually i dont know why if srk is such a great actor cant deliver good performances in his films.... will there be a day when i see him on screen n wont be able to see him but the character that he acts... i loved him kabhi haan kabhi na, swades.... when will I see that side of srk again?
Most Intelligent interview yet witty :)    well done Anupama...<br>Its okay SRK .... U cant please everyone in this world especially haters.... <br>Just do it.......people simply cant ignore u bcos u r the best!
I am a fan of both of you ... good interview...
he will look like AL Pacino when he grow old
There is no actor in the world as smart and eloquent as SRK
I love you so much
like the new intro. and the interview is on point as always.
raees bhai
This man is from another world... we do not deserve him.
Ahh another good interview. I love it when Anupama and Rajeev interview SRK. They make him talk more and it&#39;s interesting to listen to him
Who is interviewing actually srk or anupama ..lol :P :P
I enjoy  Anupama and Rajeev&#39;s interviews more than the rest. As for SRK I can listen to him forever you learn, you laugh he is simply the best
please do not insult the institution and art of acting by calling this man an actor. he is a star etc etc. but not an actor. he is a wannabe. and he may believe he is a great actor, but he isnt-someone with reservations like the ones he mentioned, cannot be an actor.
people should stop focusing on his stardom and realize what an incredible actor he is . also an original and amazingly beautiful human being . im so proud to be a fan of his
I adore SRK and love Anupama (she&#39;s my fav journo of all-time) but this was a boring mess. Possibly because I watched the SRK-Rajeev Masand interview less than 24 hours ago and a lot of that was repeated here. An ill-advised slot.
Some ares saying that he is faking his humble nature, i don&#39;t think so, it is his own way of showing it and even if he shows some arrogance , one thing i really admire is that he knows what to say and at the same time giving respect to the other person and above all his impeccable confidence. All these things reflects in his movie, which earlier i didn&#39;t get it, but now i am appreciating it.
so funny u r Anupama , gr8
SRK = Superstar. This interview is like history and evolution of 25 years career of one of greatest Bollywood stars ever. Learn from his wit, intelligence, confidence and life experience. Amazing man!
&quot;दिन ओर रात लोगे के होते होगें साहेव..सेरो का जमाना होता है&quot;!!🔫🔫🔫🔫<br>Be #Raees😎 😌<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%235daysforraees">#5DaysForRAEES</a>
He sounds so complicated and yet so beautiful ! Love him 💟
Saawariya and OSO released in 2007. So that&#39;s almost 10 years ago not 7.
Din Aur Raat Toh Logo Ka Hota Hai Shero Ka Toh Zamana Hota Hai ?          <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%235daystogo">#5DaysToGo</a> Raees
hr said raees is realistic movie, but realistic movie doesn&#39;t have songs or romance or gravity defying action.
love u bcz of srk
Can&#39;t wait for Raees. Looks like another brilliant performance by SRK after Fan. He can play anything. Brilliant actor.🙌🏻🙌🏻💋
haa bhai kuch bhi
SRK did many great films...Dilse,Asoka,Dear Zindagi, Devdas, KHKN,Darr,Hey Ram, Paheli,Swades,CDI,Fan &amp; many others... But silly enough some ppl in his country only act as if he&#39;s just doing HNY &amp; Dilwle alone. Ignorants that all I can say. As for SRK..I LOVE YOU &amp; I&#39;m big fan of you as verstile actor &amp; talent. 👌🏻❤️
anupma plz plz plz plzzzzzzzzzzzz do the interviews with directors like sanjay gupta,sidharat anand,rohit dhawan plz and many more directors because we learn more from directors
last 3 of his movies failed at the box office now he did 1 more clash
SRK 😘😘😘❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
rajeev and anupama are the best interviewer ..... AND SRK BABE U R GENIOUS
Srk Anupama interview as always super hit.!!
the introduction part &amp; the first 4-5min is so good
Anupama Chopra is a wonderful journalist. but with SRK she becomes a true fan girl. always laughing. SRK does that to most of the women 😊😊
Film Companion: If I&#39;m not wrong, Anupama said that when seven years ago OSO release with Saawariya. 2017 is the decade year of both the films. Both were Diwali releases for 2007.
✌ SrK Rock ✌
Again a great work film companion...
you can hate him or love him...<br>still he is the biggest superstar in the world
😥😥😥 no one can ignore srk....one can listen to srk whole day 😀😀
So nice interview :* :*
Anupama really amazing interview, good mix of professional and personal questions. Not an SRK fan but he is inspirational truly, we get to know he is a gr8 father as he speaks about his children. <br>film companion is there any facetime interview with Mr Aamir khan ?
I think film promotion is the worst part of being an actor. Only yesterday Rajeev released an almost identical interview with SRK. Even the duration of the interview is nearly the same ! Must be so mundane and frustrating for them to give the same interviews and answer the same old questions over and over again. Promotion has become a necessary evil, which is sad because it distracts actors from their craft. Makes them markerteers more than artists. For serious actors it must be pretty dehumanizing to do this on a routine basis :(
I love you yaar Shah Rukh 😂❤
How can anyone admire this psychologist&#39;s wet dream, considering,he doesn&#39;t even hide his issues. He is a mess! Probably coz people don&#39;t have to deal with him on a daily basis. Only superficial, opportunist people can have any relationship with him. I pity his family, mostly his children!<br>But then, maybe it is not my space to say something like that, but who cares? throughout the interview he keeps showing off while explicitly saying that he isn&#39;t! 😂😂
19;47 The man who destroyed sawariyaan....got divine justice in the form of his film getting badly beaten by the hand of the same director..so the big man learnt his lesson that day....that in front of God everyone is a kid..so stay humble..
The most intelligent person ever after Mahatma Gandhi &lt;3
what the hell kya problem h isko gaali dene mein...mediocre thinking of Indian audience...
only talks about stardom .how can a person be humble when there is so much stardom in his head. Arrogance personified.
