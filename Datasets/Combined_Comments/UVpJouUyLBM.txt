<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=352">5:52</a> finally usable in ios 17😅
Looks like 90&#39;s tv
After seeing the 14 pro and 14 this iPhone looks like ancient history
S  l o f i e s    lol
Funny how he hoped for a smaller notch at this point in time 😂. My best guess is Apple had thought about a smaller WAY ahead of this point in time.
That&#39;s my first iPhone ever! I love it! 🙂
literally just an XR, same thick ass bezels probably thicker than the iphone x&#39;s. same annoyingly wide screen. same battery life . same horrible ppi screen. if the XR had 3d touch the 11 would have been a direct downgrade
I am getting it in 2021 and i am excited
This iphone 11 model is everything for me that i want upgrading from 6s plus btw i am getting it pure white 😉 excited
Ok my question is when ppl say they end the day on roughly 25 % with the iPhone 11 is it with “Low Power Mode” ON or with it OFF. <br>Ending the day on 25 % only happens with it Low Power Mode on for me and I wonder if this is ok. I got my BRAND NEW phone on Saturday January 23, 2021 and I made this post on Tuesday January 26, 2021. I need help please
Apple just killed 3D Touch right under our noses!
I am writing this Dec 2020, IPhone 12 is here.   I was just curious to go back and check out iPhone 11.<br>One of the most surprising things is how dated/old the 11 now looks<br>Kinda clunky bezels, and the old and tired rounded edges<br>I actually do not like having  such a  jaded reaction to a one year old phone
My Apple 11 camera quality poor, touch screen slow...
At this point, apple can make their own camera brand now using the same apple chips.
The pro one looks so so much better
I’m watching this on my iPhone 11
hi your beautiful amazing smart kind awesome human ever just thought to create a positive comment for everyone and you love and respect to you and everyone in this world
I can afford the iPhone 11pro but i have the 11
I don’t care about the resolution, but the 60Hz LCD is what irks me.
Watching this with my iphone 11 mint green 😍 So amazing design. :D love it. Upgraded from iphone 6s+ to iphone 11.
Mast colour here baba😍🤣😃😭
We really, REALLY, need to start talking about what Apple call’s the “most durable iPhone ever”. Even the commercial of the IPhone 11 shows an iPhone being tossed around while the support pages are filled to the brim about iPhone 11 screen scratching.
Does anyone know the name of the intro music?
So iphone 11 is out now. That means iphone x will get cheaper<br><br><br><br><br><br>So now I can finally afford iphone 6
11 review on 9/11, CIA onto you bruh
I bought the pixel 4 but I respect how good all smartphones are!
I have wanted A iPhone ANY iPhone can&#39;t wait to finally get one,  but... do i wait for the iPhone12??? And why am I the only one in the world that LIKES THE NOTCH????😂🤣🤣😂 I&#39;ve been a Galaxy dude since the s2!! Whenever I see that notch I knew i was looking at a iPhone,  and i been buying phones because they look like,  an iPhone but not as expensive as an iPhone and now it&#39;s time for me to have my very own IPHONE!! LOL 🤣😂
Do iPhones 11 sold in the US come with a dual sim not esim? Thanks
They realised too late that the oled should be held back for “pro” line premium products.<br><br>That’s why the x and xs were discontinued.
Is anyone else disappointed in the screen colors and some blurring?
Everybody in the comments jealous of how good the iPhone 11 is 😂
lol
Best camera<br>Best battery life<br>Best performance <br>Premium Build quality<br>Good Ram Management <br>Powerful A13 bionic chipset<br>What do you want?
Marques is very smart to record the video and audio separately. So annoying when people do first impressions while it&#39;s super loud and rushed!
Greetings from the future
im usimg an iphone 11 and i can get used to the bumb but its still annoying when you first get it, also this thing gets hot fast so be careful
Even if there are disadvantages to iphone, you won&#39;t mention it.
Upgraded from a 16gb 6s Plus because apple forced me to. Took up 5gb for system and another 5gb for other. Left me with just 6gb for apps and whatever I need on a daily. 11 at 64gb was a good upgrade. Not too flashy but runs exactly like the Pro version. Not to mention i didnt need to finance as i payed this phone in full, this phone has a very good price point.<br>If you need a good camera, buy a damn DSLR.
Was worth it going from my 6 lmao
$700 for a phone and this is after a &quot;price drop&quot;.
I love it
I subscribed you, nice video
Have you tried the Huawei Mate 30 Pro ?  Thanks !
I&#39;m using my OnePlus 7 Pro rn. Kinda wanna completely switch to iOS
iPhone 11 is def attractive for its price value with its newer A13 bionic chip and new features. Nothing too drastic about its design as usual, other than its new camera (bump) setup with an extra lens being an ultra-wide lens 😉
Not going to buy it either...
After having the 11 for almost a month it really is a serious upgrade coming from a 8 but the x and 11 have similar tweaks but 11 is definitely the go to if you don’t wanna spend a ton of money 🪐🪐

Watching this on my new iPhone 11 at 1080p😛
I am watching this video on a iPhone 7
Please recommend some Apple Watch bands for less than $20
Johny Ive leaves and the next iPhone is the first iPhone with an ugly design ! <br><br>Design was the one and maybe only thing they were always amazing at
The notch is so ugly
Wow, I’ll only have this phone in my wildest dreams 😓
YAWN, what else?
decent job... Thanks heaps for this. iPhones are really fun. 💛
Marques.. does iphone 11 plays song on top of the phone&#39;s speaker?
iPhone 11 series is hard evidence of a perpetual &#39;jobs&#39; vacancy...
Perfect for people who didn’t upgrade. The Xr compromised a bit too much against the X, this doesn’t. Most people buy phones through carriers, and T mobile offers this with no down payment. Perfect time for me to upgrade from my 8.
Best part about this phone it&#39;s made the xr cheaper so I can get the same phone with a less resolution camera for cheaper.... Nice
Apple... Get ive back please....
Is it worth upgrading to an IPhone 11 from an iPhone XR? Please help?
The iPhone 11 is the same as the XS tired of the lousy design 😒
Please tell me I&#39;m not the only one who laughed out loud when I heard the work...slowfies
Watched this on my iPhone 11. Crispier than expected. 👍🏼
I still have the iPhone 4s ! Absolutely love it but can’t do much with it anymore due to updates and stuff so going to upgrade to iPhone 5 or 6 I think 🤔
I’m rocking the iPhone 7 so I think it’s time for a upgrade
That&#39;s a really crappy phone.
Does this have the same fat bezel like XR?
To call it a 720p screen would be incorrect, it&#39;s higher than 720 but still lower than 1080. Closer to 1080 than 720 actually...
I&#39;m glad to see some intelligence in the comment section. To clarify the &quot;closer to 720p&quot;, consider the notch kills off more than a couple pixels and the corners also shave off some pixels. Calling this 720p is actually being generous IMO. Only a true dipshit would try and convince everyone the less than FHD can sometimes be equal to FHD. Kinda like magic. Apple magic. Make people believe then make those same people influencers with millions of viewers.
see through camera bump is probably to make the actual camera bump look less large
Ok I phone 11 is out.. now time for leaks for the iPhone 12
Full Review please!
This is probably the ugliest phone
I like the phone camera but the tech is feels same as max lol
Apple is testing y&#39;all brand loyalty with this mess.
Why is your vocal audio so poor in this vid?
i’m contemplating getting a galaxy S10 from having an iphone. i also have an apple watch. what should i do? just get the 11 and stick with apple or take the jump?
色の質感が分かる動画でした。 感謝してます ありがとうございました😊
is purple too gay for an adolescent to use
The best use of the I phone 11 is cooking😂😂😂😂
I bet they literally just added an extra camera to the i phone 11 just to get people that want to flex on others to buy it😂😂😂Can&#39;t wait to have a good laugh😅
yes, its not much of an update except the camera.. but for someone like me, that has an iphone 7 this is a huge update (i ordered the 11) so honestly cant wait for it to arrive
I will now hate on Apple for likes <br><br><br>Apple sucks this is why:
in night mode u will be visible
years later people will say upgrading from XR....cus XR gang is strong and the numbers are high
An 🍎a day keeps doctor away. But takes kidney away!!!
Well atleast it&#39;s 699$ comparable to other flagships
and here i m with cracked screen iphone 5s holding in my hand (y) 5s is a legend
Sony xperia 5 best one...
Comments are disabled... Our official you tupe channel.... IPhone.... Apple.
You know if you aren&#39;t disturb by that huge notch in 2019, you&#39;re a true..<br>iSheep!
I was gonna get the red one but i kinda really like the lavender one. Idk which to chose😬😬
Beam? Lol samsung already had that in 2012 with the galaxy s3🤣
slofies..SLOfies SLOFIESSSSS...SAY IT AGAINNNN😂😂😂😂
Hello sir. I want to know about iphone xs max vs iphone 11. Which one is better.     Can u please reply my comment
This camera focus people have is so stupid. <br><br>Like, as long as it’s a normal, clear image— great. But these mfs make phones. Focus on the processor. Focus on the speed of it. Focus on NEW features. How about making a battery that last for days. Shit, I would pay 999 for that shit!
It doesn&#39;t look bad. I&#39;m not mad at it, not at all.
It’s so funny when you say camera pump
Can someone tell me how difficult it is to transition from and iPhone with a home button to one with Face ID
Thank you. Green iPhone 11 seemed pastel?
This phone is A joke... 🤣🤣🙈🙈
This puts this phone well in competition with the galaxy s10e which I thought was a good deal. Since I prefer android I can&#39;t wait to see what samsung does to their &quot;e&quot; model next year.
That yellow one is mine. Already pre-ordered. <br><br>But damn that mint green is sexy as fuck, I think I might switch to that one
Never ever buy a iPhone again after slowing the iPhones scandal!
I never buying an iphone, can i buy know?
Slow,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fies!
Cmon iPhone ya robbing people just a different camera and a13 chip what a difference
Samsung will be the soon introduce a transparent phone
2030<br><br>Kids : Mom can I have the  new I icamera.<br><br>Me : You know when I was your age Apple used to make phone.<br><br>Kids : WHAT ? 😱
Anyone else think all these &quot;new&quot; phones are crap? <br>&quot;It&#39;s going to look and feel very familiar...&quot; lololololololol but wait! They&#39;ve added some new&quot;key&quot; features! Oh good, so you mean they&#39;ve finally started catching up to the rest of the  smartphone industry. Wonderful.
Always liked the quality of your video man...👍<br>Now seriously waiting for @JerryRigEverything to tear this phone apart.. Lol
I&#39;m just poor
I
The only thing stoping me from buying an iphone is the shity LCD display and that it does not have a micro sd slot
Who else notice Samsung S10+ is better. Subscribe to my channel anyway.
should i buy the red one?
Please do not fall into buying this just because it exists. If you have a fair phone already, there&#39;s no need, it&#39;s a bit of a childish tendency you must grow out of.<br>This is not a significant change from what you probably own already. -likewise if you&#39;re younger or being begged by your child to buy it.
Is it come with 5g ?
Where do I watch the podcast?
I haven’t had an iPhone since the 6 and this doesn’t seem like a very innovative model compared the XR. It really seems like Apple’s pixel 1 lol which is what I have currently. That lower price seems fair though. Unfortunately, I’m going to have to get this since my grad school has forced me to get an iPad. The compatibility is too good to pass up
I hope someone can help me: everyone is compairing the iPhone 11 w/ the XR, wasnt the X better than the XR? <br>So compairing this three phones. Which is the best one? Which should i buy?
I rather get a flip phone since they don’t seem to upgrade display
Night mode not being able to be turned on when you want and only when apple thinks its right? Thats peak apple.
How do I get that wallpaper! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=370">6:10</a>
slofies!
can someone tell what colour is that on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=200">3:20</a>? is it the purple or white? tia
iPhone 11 starts at ₹64900 in India which is roughly $900! Apple ripping Indian customers smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
I&#39;m not buying another iphone until they bring back the home button with the fingerprint.
Should I purchase an iPhone XR or iPhone 11?
A12....awkward
iphone just recycled their unbuy phones
Nice video. Thinking about upgrading my iPhone 8 Plus to the 11 or 11 Pro...
Well nvm I will stick with galaxy note 10
im waiting my new iphone 11 for the 1st time... i chose white-128Gb... 😍<br>3 days left...
Can a iPhone 8 case fit in the iPhone 11 case
Why would you purchase a iPhone 11 when AT&amp;T’s G5 internet is being rolled out nationwide next year.  I will be waiting to purchase an iPhone with the fastest new G5 technology.
Why seem like new thing on iPhone is all old stuff on Android
what about the faster LTE?
This price drop just shows how much money they probably made of the XR. Cost of production especially with the lower quality display is probably insanely low.
It is disaster!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=378">6:18</a> Eight awesome angles!
I have a xiaomi mi max 3 larger screen +7,2  bigger battery 5500 mah additional memory sd and i could buy 6 more in the price of an iphone .... Of 2017.
Omg poor Steve if u could only knew what the fuck they have done to your inventions... Stockholders have taken control and now they make cameras on your iPhone.
The only problems I have is <br>1. Slow charging speed<br>2. The lighting cable<br>3. The aspect ratio is a little wide. I think longer phones are more beautiful now adays. That so little complain compared to other phone because almost everything is ideal if not for the prices.
Price??? You can buy two super mobiles for that money like xiaomi m8 ???
Apple should’ve just made a new camera not a phone
Remember it&#39;s got 4gig ram vs the 3gig ram on the xr. I feel this is nice phone that are reasonably priced plus IOS is supported for a long time. So this phone might last 4 years. That is a  smart buy in the long run.
Hey guys pls help haha should I buy the black one or white one? 👀
Why you make video of same tech? Go through Xiaomi Mi A3
Should I go for a refurbished Iphone X or a 11 ?
Are the Lenses really new? Or the same like the iPhone X
Helped me pick what phone i should probably select
Love this channel
Watching on Galaxy s10
Copy Previous iPhone + Change The Appearance A Little = Printing Money
Do iPhone 11,11 Pro and 11 Pro Max have Live Wallpapers feature? Cuz new iPhone 11s don’t have 3D Touch like iPhone XR.
Apple is doing so bad.... not even usb-c, incredible!
The funny thing is....people are gonna buy this
Still in love with my jet black iPhone 7.
i’m getting the iphone 11 and i can’t decide on the light purple or light yellow ! like for yellow comment for purple PLEASEE! (i have an iphone 7 rn )
Is there a reason why in 2019 we’re still getting flagship devices with barely 720p displays?
i have an iPhone 6s and i really like it
Slofies!!! 😂
The company became a camera company lol
I am not excited at all. Boring phone especially that ugly notch
The Apple logo is a bite of the forbidden fruit. The price of the first Apple computer was $666.66. The Google Chrome logo contains a 666. The Amazon logo is a phallic symbol. The Monster Energy logo is a 666 in ancient Hebrew numbers. It&#39;s everywhere today.
When the iphone 11 is worse than the iphone X
What Apple needs to do is how they can create a technology and resurrect Steve Jobs. Apple is merely fooling stupid apple fanboys to shell out big amount of money for an Apple &quot;branded&quot; mediocre products beautified with &quot;cool&quot;  advertisements so they can save their company and pay their CEOs.... And it is working! When will you guys wake up? This is no different from Theranos.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Slowfies, WHataaaaaaaaat
Please told us about ipad 7th generation..
Love it !
Marques may i ask , what do you have on the white pack behind you on the table? I feel that you already have new iphones for testing but can not make a video untill Apple let you do that isn’t it? 😉😀
Just say how it is. Same apple laziness in design. Yay smh.
It&#39;s full HD LCD display, not 720 fyi..
Keling bet keling
Mi 9t pro better
Tbh you don’t but the iPhone for new features you buy it for the looks you get the features in the updates which is great for iPhones you can get new features with updates
I think Marques finally sold out to Apple. This doesn&#39;t seem critical from him. Just my opinion.
720p, my cheap piece of shit Chinese phone from 2 years ago is 1080p and it was less than £100.
“Apple’s number one in the world on selling previous iPhone?” are you serious? where did you get the stats? in Tim’s presentation? and you believe everyone knocking on your house door selling “salvation” ? or it’s American world only? lol
I m weating for jerryrigeverything unboxing😂😅🤣😭
still a notch that sucks
Hi! Is it worth it since my current phone is the iPhone 7? Thank you!
Hey if you are coming from an iPhone 5 or 6, it might not disappoint you but if your coming from an XR, you will get bored and disappointed because you don’t need to waste more money except for ones who actually need new phones. 🤘🏼🖖🏻👍🏻
People would even buy ishit for 2000$
These reviewers would&#39;ve been furious if this design was implemented by android phones , what about camera bump when you put it on table and text marquees been giving bad remarks about it to android phones and now he&#39;s okay with it
White or purple???
Great vid as always, hey even I made a video/parody on the new iPhone 11 it would be great if anybody could check my channel out
My dream is to get an iPhone opened up a YouTube channel for financial support to buy an iPhone but unfortunately no one can subscribe to my channel.

Whats the best top of the line phone right now?
Hi
Bullshit what the difference between r, s ,xmas apple=hustlers
I dunno man. I have an 8. I’m sure they’ll update the OS and make it hard to use. I game more than anything so I guess it’s the ROG Phone 2 for me
You are handsome hehe
You are just paying for a extra camera
Lol. This is laughable..... We recycled iPhone 10...... We give you.... iPhone 11! Hahahaha.
Dang it. All of these colors are available and I&#39;m gravitating towards white. Chi sono
I wish in my life I have a iphone, I can&#39;t afford it because im a poor person only 😭
Now the IPhone XR will our sell this too.
3 Words<br><br><br><br><br>Google Pixel 4!
hahaha I can finally get the iphone8 now lol
Why is he editing his vooce
It’s a rubbish phone, but who cares <b>LoOk At aLL ThE PrETty ColOrS</b>
lame
I’m not buying a new iphone until the notch is gone.
i’m gonna buy this phone because of the colour, and no one can stop me
I wanted to get the 11 as I currently have a xs max and was wanting the upgrade cause it’s cheaper a month then what I’m paying currently . Is it worth it you think
Steve jobs would be dissapointed....
You are an excellent reviewer .
Fucking comments. Everybody here criticize the iPhone.  Wtf ? You have nothing better to do !? Stupid people
U miss one thing which is screen size ? 6.1
Wow I Want It
Fugly ass phone
Its the same, stick with the Xr
i am disapointed.. sincerely
i rather get the xr then this

Those Side bezel .. omg...
How bout you STFU
Stfu mikalya
Slowfies bwahahahaha
Same of y’all complain too much. Try to come up with something innovative in 2019 🤔
Hey man I like u r hairstyle😋
iPhone 11 or iPhone X’s max or note10 plus... which is best to buy now!!🤯
Watching on a s10 right now does anyone recommend switching to iPhone 11
My main disappointment is how much gigabytes it has (only 64 gigabytes) which is a little bit, and it won’t last long
The logo is moved! I better go drop a grand for that!
Still waiting for the holographic model
he&#39;s shading the phone the WHOLE video 💀
Uff practically its not necessarily ✌🏻but it’s crazy if u follow all new features of I phone,.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=128">2:08</a> or the thumbnail, is that the new violet color or basic white?
The wireless communications sounds a lot like wifi direct...tomato tomato.
I preorder and I hate waiting 😤 just fucking ship it to me
Should I get the iPhone 11 or the Samsung Galaxy S10+????!!!!!
This is just an additional camera , not a new iPhone but Apple will still make cash from people who don&#39;t know Ip X is still relevant
Wait so the max it can go to is 720p on YouTube and others?
I still have an iPhone 5 🤣
𝐒𝐢𝐫 𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐩𝐡𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐩
What&#39;s the song in the intro man?! He&#39;s used the same song in another video as well! Just gimme an answer people!
sooo if you are able to switch to video when long pressing the shutter button, how do we do the burst now?🤔
iPhone 6S gang
*Sigh*year after year apple is failing at making me upgrade from my 7 plus
IPhone is a Disaster ...it died in the same day when Steve Jobs died. I don&#39;t understand why people are still buying it,except the bright colours  that attracts women and gays there&#39;s nothing positive  unfortunately.
Nobody talks like this about MontBlanc 500 dollars for a pen. It’s about build quality and reliability. While you’re Vivo or Nokia phone may stop working after an year. That’s not the case with the IPhone. Don’t buy it if you don’t desire to. But don’t be a negative Nancy about it.
Wow, more efficient chip. <br>One hour more!! Now I will be able to have my iPhone work for... two hours.
For me XS is better then this XR recycled Product and yes i will be staying with it 😍
finally upgrading from a 7+, and i gotta say the 7+ is so efficient and gets the work done.
4K video on a not even 1080p screen
Is it bigger than an 8 plus?
I&#39;m stuck between the red one and the white one!! any suggestions
Who knows the background music at the beginning?？
Wish I could effort and iPhone😓😓😓
Someone help me, is it worth upgrading from a XR?
Please review the Nubia z20
In my view the 11 Pro with the triple lense looks good, but this designe doesn&#39;t works with the 11 as the square is the same but a lense is missing and the whole things starts to look just clunky.
New toy 📱📲
Same, same same same
iPhone 11: Fine<br>iPhone 11 Pro: Good
Lol wtf is this
I&#39;m going from a 6s to the 11 in Red. Looks like I made the right decision, the phone looks beautiful.
How come the price goes down for the 10s max it’s ridiculous and it looses so much value smh
720p 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 what year are we in again
Sticking with my iPhone 6s it’s 2019 and apple are still trying to rip people off with rubbish changes
Still rocking the 7
If Steve’s where to come back alive he will see how us need Asian people
or on your lap when you’re driving:)
well technically  it isn&#39;t cheaper because as usual the moment it dropped the price on the phone it replaced dropped. the difference is to keep it in line with the usual price difference the previous builds are dropping $150  instead of the usual $100. so the 10r is now $599 which means since there are hardly any changes besides the camera is the new phone worth it?
Apple really is proud of a 720 p display in 2019, lol
That Phone is terrible.
Love you reviews - minus your wants.
Love you reviews - minus your wants.
Great! I love the XR, and feel zero surprise that the XR sells so well. And you know, if it ain&#39;t broke, keep on doing likewise (AND making it cheaper).
No point at all upgrading my XR
Apple&#39;s creativity and innovation died along with Steve Jobs. Apple is getting way too comfortable and not taking many risks.
I’m still using an iPhone 6s  do you think I should upgrade to the iPhone 11 ?
I don&#39;t like this phone but I&#39;m mad because they discontinued 7, xs and xs max. I&#39;m trust trying to get and now I&#39;m really angry so....
Hello iphone 11 see you six years
Iphone 11 or iphone xs max? Which better?
So apple adds a dope camera AND drops the price (which y’all used to complain about) and y’all still complain. SMH. Grow up and just buy another phone lmao
I was looking forward to a nice iphone but honestly disappointed. Might make the switch now.
I can see how this phone broke Jony Ive
Smh apple! Same design again! This sucks! I miss the old iPhone days where we actually looked forward to innovation.
So people shoot 4k video to watch on a 720 p screen?
when you look at the cameras sideways, it looks like a face with a pimple.
Cool video
I&#39;ll get the iphone 11 because I&#39;m still using a 6s.
I really like his voice...it’s so soothing....I keep coming back to this video
I was also hoping for a smaller or and elimination of the notch...
Are the bezels the same as the XR or are they smaller? Because in video they look thinner 🤔
Can’t wait to upgrade from my 6s plus to the 11
Worst model ever
Watching this while having a samsung hurts
Kitchen stove phone 😂😂😂😂😂
Why just why so ugly??
my 2013 xperia has 4k..it should be standard on all phones.
Steve Jobs would’ve never endorsed a model like this 🤦‍♂️
Is 5G ready ?
Bro how you will get the new phones early.. Will you pay money for it pls say bro
S10 is 100 years from the future, when I see this shit.
I still use iPhone 6 Plus
One of the most ugliest phone ever created !
Can anyone recommend any good phones better than this phone?
It’s ugly. Can they put all of this in one lens?!
Shit review.
I&#39;m never gonna say &#39;slowfies&#39; outloud
I’ll stick to my XR there is nothing new except a slight change to the camera. Why can’t they change stuff like making the phone calls appear on the top of the screen without taking up the whole screen when you’re doing something. Oh I forgot Samsung has that feature already 🤷🏻‍♀️ And Snapchat has that slow motion thing already. Disappointed🤦🏻‍♀️
isheep : innovation 🎛.
So the basic iPhones are now the cheaper versions? Lmao apple just bullying y&#39;all now.
Lies in the trailer <br>Hasn’t got the highest video or photo quality (has a 12 Mega pixel main  camera🤣)<br>Doesn’t have the the fastest chip in my phone<br>The huawei mate 20 pro has a 40 Mega pixel camera <br>How can it take a 4k video when it has a 326ppi screen
11 pro camera looks like alien
Wait did you take your iMac pro with you to the event?
I realize this is seen as the new IPhone XR.  Would you view this as a sensible upgrade from the iPhone X?  I’m aware of the downgrade from OLED to LCD but seems like you’d get a significant bump on the camera and the processor.  Thoughts?
Ahh yes, a new phone for the non sensibles
thank you for showing what ios version it is running.
Marketed for the younger generation that think having the &quot;best&quot; phone is what it&#39;s all about. Maybe you should do a video more about why it&#39;s a waste money on the phones.
Marques, overall what do you think about Apple calling a phone with 720+p  resolution LCD display and just 64gb storage as iPhone 11 in 2019.I really hoped apple would at least match screen resolution to that of 6s plus even though LCD!! So far we have come to a state if we want an iPhone with 1080p with more than 100GB storage, $1000 is a bare minimum!!

Watching this on my iphone 6 goml
Anyone else out there with an iPhone 6 still?
iPhone is to the phone world what English dubs are to the manga/anime world. These features (triple camera setup,  telephoto,  wide angle and night mode) have BEEN on phones for at least a year or so and they&#39;re just now getting it. We already done read about it(manga), experienced it(anime), and now you&#39;re just now catching up (dubs).  But Apple is still making money
I love my iphone 5s
here comes all the apple fanboys saying <i>i bUy it bEcaUse oF tHe eCosYsTEm</i>
I hate Apple but my gf wants it, and I&#39;m gonna buy it as a gift for her, it&#39;s killing me that I&#39;m gonna buy an iphone
Damn man why don&#39;t they play around with the design of the phone .....<br>Same old design from last 3 years!!<br>They definitely are not daring!!
Title should&#39;ve been: Huge Apple Fan Boy Tries To Find Good Things About The New iPhone 11.
Marcus and his love of camera above all. A true sheeple phone
Every thing is going as I planed. Apple drops the iPhone 11 and iPhone XR price go down and buy it. And finally I’m going to let my iPhone 6s go. Sike
I saw Jonathan hahsha lolz 😂 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=432">7:12</a>
nothing special to waist money on. flop
Copy of pixel 4 leaked concept.
Still rocking my iPhone X - maybe 2020&#39;s iPhone
I have an iphone 7 and I am planning to buy the 11 idk tho I’m quite broke rn
its those blade less shavers
I have always been annoyed by one camera bump. Now there are two ?! And still the same low resolution as the iPhone 6.. so if I “upgrade” from my old 6s+ to the iPhone 11, I get a screen with a lower resolution?
For all of you saying apple is going downhill sales wise, the IPHONE XR is the best selling phone worldwide of the first half of 2019 (november 2018-june 2019) with 26 million sold. The 2nd best is an entry level samsung a10 with 13 million sold.
It looks horrible.
just ugly
Seriously. Apple needs to be more creative. Same bs every year besides simple camera updates. Ridiculous
It&#39;s camera bump but camera bump 😂😂 lol
No OLED<br>326ppi<br>No fast charging<br>Price drop is just hype.<br>For 700 dollars it&#39;s still not worth buying.
can u give me a iphone for free..i m very poor
My mom’s 4s finally died today. It was running iOS 9, but the main apps still updated (Facebook, Weather, YouTube, etc). I swapped sim cards with my old 4s in the meantime which still works. I am still loving my 7 Plus, but now that we’re phone shopping, I can get 50% off an 11 for my trade in. We like iPhones because they are reliable and solid. Get a screen protector and a $10 case. Mine’s met the wood floor more times than I like to admit, but looks like new. <br><br>Whereas my Android died a week after my 2 year contract was up, like it was programmed into the phone to self destruct. And it only worked well for the first year before it started getting hot and barely holding a charge. My Samsung tablet died in about a year. The lifespan on those devices make me never want another Android. They seemed glitchy and a bunch of the apps didn’t work properly. I’m not the kind of person who always has to have the newest thing. I want what I have to work well and last. <br><br>If only these phones worked like my 2005 iPod, which also still works like new minus some surface scratches from living in my car and the bottom of my purse for almost 15 years. That thing is a rock.
The iPhone 11 will surely beat the Galaxy S7 😆
The brand new iPhone  lol the only new is the apple logo on a different spot lol same ugly notch lol
I’m pissed it doesn’t have 1tb internal storage or at least more then 512gb
Ill stick to my iphone 6s thank you.
iPhone pro like panda yes?.
Time to buy the Xs I guess 🤷‍♂️
Well, i am keeping my xr, already waiting for the 2020 launch to upgrade lol!!
I’ll keep my 6s. Next year probably I’ll go for galaxy note. Adios, apple.
No match with my Iphone X ! <br>X was and is the best one.. trust me... I didnt have to upgrade to XS
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=364">6:04</a> Beam me up scotty
Next year the Apple logo will be on the bottom of the phone!
Is that just me or is the notch bigger?
Where is the iPhone xr gang ?!?!<br>Hit like😍😍
Better enjoy the money at strip club instead of buying this shit.
Like si viniste a ver la calidad de la cámara de 40 000 $
Ugly as hell
What good is a phone without a fingerprint scanner. I won&#39;t buy any iphone until they bring back touchID.
Apple is releasing a phone that loses a fight against Samsung&#39;s s10 ? Are they trying to commit suicide?...
1 kidney = just camera..nah
Android user here? <br>Only me? Okay
Yeah, I’m fine with my Xs Max. It’s literally the same phone just a upgraded camera
Just switch to Samsung Dammit<br><br>They&#39;re not even hiding it no more they think we are stupid.
I would rather buy a good camera instead of a new iphone for just a camera upgrade
Still Redmi AND realme give more at cheaper price
All the Android fanboys come here to preach how their OS is better lol
Do I upgrade from the 8 plus to this 🤔
Probably the worst design of all time, good job apple you just started digging your own graveyard!!
Why just dont go and buy an expensive camera ????Why people are so crazy about takingng photos 🙄🤔😦<br>I dont see anything new and exiting in all the new phones these days....
Everything is the same except the camera so a waste of money to upgrade good to know.
When comparing photos taken from all three models, is there anything that stands out from one another? Clarity, blurs, lighting, etc.?
If people want fluff buy an Android, if people want quality and a product that always works, pick an Apple.
Cameras are huge
How much iphone 11 in philippines?
slow fees 😂😂🖕🏼🖕🏼
Mark ass brown lee
My last iPhone was an iPhone 6s. I seriously need an upgrade. This phone will be good for me in terms as a new upgrade.
You&#39;re paying for a camera Apple died when Steve jobs died
Couldn&#39;t they join the cameras like in the iPhone 10?
...still sticking with my TMobile Sidekick...
My iPhone 7 Plus has 1080P.........
did you pack your imac with you :o
Alguien más viene por marciano?
I will wait for iPhone 100 with 100mp camera
Send me one iPhone 11
Why aren&#39;t you talking about the big notch on the iphone 11 marques?
Still rocking the 6+ 🤣🤣
Those edges are terrifying. So much space wasted
F*** that selfie camera, Get rid of that ugly notch
Will these still have the front camera portrait mode? Like the 10?
I have an 8+ might upgrade if you can really call it that lol but the new camera shit is a plus
720p display, what the heck is that lol
🎶 Still no headphone jack 🎶
I don&#39;t have a iphone but when i get a iphone i want the 6s because the new iphone doesnt impress me😂
What else the NEW iPhone 11 has that is not existing on my S10e phone? Like what else?
iPhones nowadays are just garbage
Sticking with my iPhone 7 plus until the wheels fall off...
I still get will smith flashbacks
Apple: releases new phone <br>Marques:&quot; Same.. Same.. Same...&quot;
People will buy this just to make themselves look good, if they buy something that’s worth a lot they will get more clout
Still modern feeling... No gimmicks as a slider camera or something... And the screen prooved itself to be a great lcd (in the Xr)
HD+ is a joke
I don’t know if I should stay with the iPhone 8 Plus for another year
For that price i will buy samsung s11 next year
I got excited when this released so I could get the XR for cheaper, butttttt they&#39;re the same price, and still to expensive for me😂😂
Like si vienes por Marciano
Roll on 2020 iPhone 12 shall hold onto my iPhone 7 thanks.
People: why there is nooo difference between xs max and 11 pro max ?!!!<br>Childish Gambino: this is america &quot;&quot;
I used to dream of having an iPhone 10 but seeing this...<br><br><br><br><br>I still dreamed of getting an iphone 10
Hey guys I&#39;m a new youtuber it would mean alot if you subscribe to my channel. For my upcoming content.
fingerprint Sensor on the Logo Please!!! arrrrrggh
My friend what is up with that unpopular aspect ratio you chose for you videos.
Still the thickest bezels out of all &quot;bezel-less&quot; phones. Even 2007 iPhone&#39;s side bezels were thinner
Them taking the headphone jack out is the dumbest move ever that company really is stupid but I really like the purple tbh
It&#39;s very impressive how they manage to go up on stage to announce a phone that has absolutely nothing new and they can still feel proud of it ....
Lol $1000 for a not so upgraded iPhone. 1000 dollars
still no AMOLED screen :D and such an ugly camera bump OMG apple!!!
Just came here to laugh...
my oneplus x from 2015 has thinner bezels than this, and that notch, what where they tinking?
Still watching this on my iPhone5s and still think apple became boring and greedy since iPhone 6.  New wine in old bottles is the motto of this company now to rip people’s money but hey if they have it who am i to tell them to be mindful
anybody else already pre-ordered the iPhone 11
Even if I own an iPhone, just because I like the iOS instead of Android, I think Apple is the most overrated company on the market, just because in the past they rocked the smarthphones market. If they will GO straight on this line,in 5 years Even LG will be more productive than Apple. Poor Steve, I think he’s rolling in the grave.
I am gonna keep my iPhone xr
Ou this iPhone sucks
Vengo de marciano aver tu cámara de 48 mil dólares
Like si vieneron aquí por marciano :-!
Just preordered the 11, can’t decide between black or red, currently have a red XR.
Is this company joking with their fans? Meanwhile Samsung and Huawei released like 2 different phone series each with its unique features.
This iphone 11 is really bullshit looking phone
Hey MKHDB, do you have a specific LUT for black males ? You look so dope on screen. xD
Ohh. The biggest AppleLogist is here again. Hyping a dead product. Sad
Cook launched a new cooktop!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=334">5:34</a> dedicated wam
Wtf why it looks so small 🙄 <br>Stupid phone 😌
the fact that apple on the back is not a little upwards but in the very middle makes me uncomfortable
you keep comparing it to the XR so is the new main &quot;iPhone&quot; now the new cheap phone? is the Xs or X better than this new 11?
iphone is shit
The point overlooked by you and so many others; is that some of us long time Apple users are photographers. We have a bag of lenses and can already access ultrawide and also understand nightmode is stupid.
Apple definitely makes the best red coloured phone..<br>Like if u agree 👍

I just want to know how big his hands are
You have three hands?? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=279">4:39</a>
are the big ass cameras that necessary? looks really bulky
Samsung ftw🔥
MKB Thanks so much for sharing Deb.✌👍🏼
Youtube should have a HAHA react button.
I don&#39;t understand why company like apple can&#39;t reduce thickness of bezels. So fat. Nothing is perfect✓✓✓
Base 64GB iPhone 11<br>US $699 (£560 here in the UK)<br>But it&#39;s priced at £729 here ($909)<br>Yeah now imagine the 11 Pro models. <br>Fuck Apple.
its very ugly from back.better to buy Xiaomi K20- pro.but there is no comparison of camera.
My grandma loves iphone
3D video yet?
Can u pause the video and continue with a later addition. Say I record a project in the beginning pause and then show the end project?
I’m still using the iPhone 6s Plus it still works can do the exact same stuff as this iPhone
I love you 💕
Wait so the iPhone 11 only has 720 resolution ? As in on YouTube you cannot watch 1080p videos ?
another dissapointed year from apple apart from camera and apple logo from top little bottom hardly anything new.....   😞
Apple out here selling $700 phone skins, same phone. 🤷🏾‍♀️ I’m good.
Can’t wait to see this man hit 10 mil Subs I like to see people succeed in life.
Thank god. Now I can buy iPhone 7 plus
no innovation = apple
Idgaf I’m Riding with iPhone .
I’m torn whether to go w red or purple iPhone 11  :(
that shit will buy only americans most because they love to pay more for less
Bakwaas
Its the ugliest iphone design ever! Iphone X is much better.
Please let the zombie apocalypse happen, so steve jobs can show tim cook how to make a correct iPhone
Feels like watching  the New IPhone video from LongBeachGriffy
this is just dumb
I love the lavender purple🤩
in a few months we will see android manufacturers making clones of the iphone 11 camera square, google already cloned it
what do apple top employees feel passionate about in life? being different to the point of taking the wrong route?
I have not been excited for an iPhone since 6. And Apple didn&#39;t drop the price. All it did was increase it year after year so that when they don&#39;t it becomes a surprise.
I want it. It’s beautiful
Hey @MKBHD. Can you please tell me that which phone will be perfect for me. I am going to change my 6s soon, so I was thinking that Iphone 11 would be perfect for me, and not Pro
Any one interested.....
I have a 7 plus that is not good at keeping a charge at all. I upgraded to the 11 just for the color to be honest. And hopefully the battery life holds out longer!
2019 : Iphone 11 <br>2020: Iphone 11 GPP unlock
It&#39;s basically an xr&#39;s brother with one more camera but it&#39;s way more bad looking ... 😢 <br><br><br><br>Btw price is still lower than xr
The difference between the phones are that the 10 has now been turned into an 11.
Alright! Same phone higher price! Woooooo!
The only thing that keeps me coming back to IPhone is the durability &amp; reliability... innovation at Apple died with Steve Jobs... So I never go for the latest iPhone... just moved to X from 6s 3 months ago...
Sorry Apple... That desigh is just sad as fuck...
Im good ill continue using my 6s plus lol
I’m feeling really uncomfortable watching these outstanding camera lenses. Don’t they get scratched?? Why don’t they plunge them a little?
WHEN WILL THE FULL REVIEW COME?
2009: Your iPhone has a nice camera <br>2019: Your camera has a nice iPhone
We all become sarcastic and say lame jokes about I phone because we can afford it. but deep inside we all want it<br><br><br><br><br><br>.if it is not true ask yourself
This 6,99 9,99 10,99 stuff.. do english native speakers really say that or is it rather marketing bullshit that seems to stick and work incredibly well?
Poda poora you fake son of a bitch you fucking apple fan boi fuck yourself..you pussy.
You inspire me man. I&#39;ll get to where I wanna get, I&#39;ll get there. Thank you.
Booooorrrriiiiinnnnggggggggg!<br>Yawning...
Looking good but producer must write desşgned by apple in california or fakes are very very will be fautred
Nah I’ll stick with my $250 Huawei
sucks to be you , kid
I wonder if it has 3D Touch
Sorry.. but i love my galaxy S10..
Apple is now making phones with camera . In the future, they will be making cameras with calling  feature. I see where they are going , from competing Samsung to competing Nikon .
Video round up. The iPhone 11 is the same as all the other iPhones but has an extra camera
In general I am in agreement with Marques&#39; opinions on new products. He is always fair with his impressions and calls out a product when its subpar; but I feel he was being a bit lenient on Apple&#39;s new Iphone 11. The product itself has the features companies such as samsung, LG and Huwaei used to implement in their phones 8 years ago. The screen resolution is subpar, the charging speed is super slow (the fact you have to pay more to get an upgraded charger is ridiculous). The camera is as impressive as the other phones that came out two or three years ago. What it does well is integration into it architecture (which most people would agree). There is no way this product represents innovation. Heck oneplus is more innovative while utilizing a budget that is nowhere near in comparison
Apple has been officially renamed to icamera
Real quick, I have an iPhone 6 and was wondering are the new iPhones worth the money? If not I’ll just get a hand me down from someone. Also don’t say ‘just move to samsung’ I have too many apple products that I can move out of the eco system.
hi, marques can you sponsor meeee😹😹
Everyone one:  oh the Samsung s10 has 3 cameras a 2k amoled screen and has amazing battery life with 8 gb of ram and the most powerful gameing processor to use it.<br>Apple: wE HavE 720P aND a ExTRa HOur Of BaTteRy liFe.
Since I own a note10 I find I fone look like phone from 10yrs ago
As always<br>Apple sheeps.... Buying the same fucking shit over and over again.<br>XD
I have a legitimate question:<br><br>I own the iPhone XR (I love it by the way) but everyone told me that it could only do 720p also but atleast on YouTube it can do 1080p?l.. is that something different or??
The only reason why i’m hesitating to get a note10 is because apple has my saves from games I’m actually playing.
S10 👍
Apple also removed “3d touch panels” from both 11pro and 11pro max, so they saved up some cash so they can cut the 50 bucks off of the new “iphone 11” 😉😉, and I guess these two panels may cost them more than 50 bucks. Anyway smart and good move.
and same idiot rich buyers
I like your voice lol!
so useful thank you!
Steve jobs apple company is ruined by the current management
so you get a bluetooth to send gifs like 14 years ago
Apple is just greedy for money.
iphone users are fools if they buy this phone just like note users who brought the note 9, its okay to skip a year if the new alleged upgrade is not worth it. i just upgraded from the note 8 as the note 9 was not worth the money as they didnt do anything worth upgrading
I hate thar iPhone the others are better
Samsung S10 :X
hhahaha the notch is as big as apple fanboys asses cuz they like to be fucked in the ass every new release
The Same this ,the same that ,the same . The difference is the logo ,I phone is pathetic
Camera?? I thought it&#39;s a burner
Yeah they drop the price cus the phone is ugly
Wonder why no information is realsed on millamp battery size for the new iphone,?<br>Because its absolute shit compared to anything else, 3110 mAh battery HA, my phone same price has 4000 mAh. Its fkn hilarious how shit iPhone products are and people keep buying the,.
Samsung user
iPhone 11 can cook better than Redmis,
Is that mean, I can&#39;t play 1080p video on youtube with iphone11?
I’m waiting for jerry to rigs it
Shout out to all NOT watching on their iPhone’s 11.
Should I upgrade I have the iPhone SE
Stupid fucking notch lol
So no innovation ur saying lol
Apple is garbage.
Yesterday I just bought iPhone 7 Plus 👌
cameras are like allergies to I-phones...oof...they are spreading...
This dude is a hype beast prob got paid a little something to try and make it seem better then what it is it’s madden for phones same thing new features not worth even $500 garbage smh
Go from an 8 to 11 or wait for next year?
I&#39;m sticking to my max, this iPhone looks ugly and odd
What&#39;s the use if you can&#39;t view your own 4k video on your 720p phone
☹️😞😩😩😩😩😩
<b>IT. LOOKS. UGLY</b>
Iphone going unglier every year
but dude, at least fill that screen to body better ffs, make the notch smaller, you definitely can fit the hardware in a smaller space, they really used the same template as the the last two years, its freaking disgusting to put new phone not changed even in the slightest
Pleas dont show more the ny iPhones its just ugly phones
I wonder how many Apple victims will spunk 700 dollars on this old technology device with an upgraded camera?
I phones are dead wood since old Stevie Jobs went to sleep, Huawei is where its at in 2019. WORD.
Not even close to the X in my pocket
I dont understand why they used the bump for the iPhone 11<br>Why not just use a normal dual camera
miss the days where apple done a redesign then a s model of that design and that was it.  Keeping the same phone design for 3 - 4+ years sucks
Face lift of Xr
If your new product is shit, then you drop the price.
This phone is UGLY!!!
nobody even mentioned that the logo is now in the centre and looks so much better in general.
What is that song that is played in the beginning ?
Tim:the i phone 11<br>Me:google,can a person survive without kidneys
Coooooool.😁😁😁😁😁😁
Говно💩
The super wide camera preview hint is brilliant,  those features are what make apple a great company.
Team give me a new idea,  ho ho ho me , what if we put more cameras<br><br>Love it! Great let’s build the 11 and
Okay I’ll just keep my old phone and buy a real digital camera
you&#39;ve said &quot;slowfies&quot; over 3.7 million times now
How much does Apple pay you MKBHD for promoting their outdated phones ?
I’m still happy with my iPhone 6, planning now to invest for the next one I’m still between XR or if is better get this 11 generation
the design is so... childish. definitely could’ve been executed better. i thought apple was always concerned about aesthetics? they flopped fr this time 😪 i’ll soon be switching to android (samsung s10+) bc apple doesn’t seem to get the clue that THEY NEED TO CATCH UP WITH TECHNOLOGY. it’s literally same shit, different day, higher price. how about no? how embarrassing.
The colors 😚
Yuck love my OnePlus 6
Why is the iPhone 11 cheaper the. The XR
wonder if they can use the u11 for audio transmission. would be great to finally get lossless wireless audio in a phone since they ripped the headphone jacks from our cold, dead hands. <b>still rocking my hifiman cans</b>
Recently i remarked one thing. Are we using phone as we knew it or are we using just photo? Because you guys just talk about camera. We are not photographer we are users. If i need a good camera i will buy a canon...
Your kiddin me. He called THAT an 720p display? It’s 828p. Wow, Marques actually calls it 720p. I thought a big tech head like him would know that. <br><br>————-       ———- <br>                               <br>   <br><br><br>|_________________|
Its same shit over and over again. Sooooo bored now
I bet they removed the R so people won&#39;t easily make fun of it as a &quot;cheap alternative&quot; like what happened to 5C and XR.
Impression: an iPhone with a tumor, or maybe  3.
$699<br>IPhone 11 : 720p LCD 60Hz<br>Oneplus 7 Pro : 1440p AMOLED 90hz<br>LMAO
Oh shit! Jerry is so gonna roast this camera bump :D
Apple announced iCamera not iPhone at Keynote 2019. What a disappointment apple.
You can get more features than this on android. Let&#39;s say for a really lower price. But let that sink. People buy that s*it to make them feel rich.
Observing a moment of silence for all iPhone users. I would suggest before buying these new iPhones to go and compare iPhones to the S10 or Note 10 in real life and you will clearly see that the iPhone clearly looks 3 years behind it. Just the processor is faster but other than that, iPhones are so much behind.
too many cameras staring at me...
you lost me at 720p
Remember ppl it’s just a phone.........IT’S JUST A PHONE
Everyone hates apple but can&#39;t stop stalking apple instead of ignoring it..... weird!
Sorry sorry ... What is the new features again ??? <br>I have it better in my xiaomi k20 which is only 300$ lol 😂<br>No more lies Mac and apple <br>No more lies <br>I swap completely my both iphones to xiaomi Mi9 explorer edition and k20pro<br>Sorry great America <br>China is making my life more easier and better and longer
I have spent thousands of dollars on apple products since the very first<br> iphone. I have had many macbook pro, ipads,imac. And you know what, you<br> android guys, YOU WERE RIGHT. Apple just laughs at us and spit in our <br>face. Android, here I come. Better late than never.

I got an ad from Apple
Who else brings their iMac Pro to a 1 day event
I liked this video not for the i-PhONe but for you brother
Apple logo should be on his default place
I know you&#39;ve already touched the Pixel 4 and I&#39;m hoping for your great video from your channel very very soon. 😊
if i have the money ill just buy the XS Max. It’s like the peak and the rest after it are just copycats. but i really like iphone’s camera. my iphone 6s’ camera is still good for me.
OMG
720p . Fuck this shit . If i shit myself and mix my shit with horseshit, itd still smell better than this shit. Fuck apple. <br>I like mkbhd but i turnt off the vid right after that
Fuck that! Apple dose not know what year they are inn... wake up and step it up aplle!<br><br>Such a disappointing year for apple company...
Any sri lankans here?
I agree
yaaaWn....from my Samsung Note 10
“They say” 😂😂😂😂
Once again they&#39;ve done nothing. Apple is yet to make a major contribution to tech in the last decade. When your the 3rd best selling phone, prices drop. Come on man.
These tech nerds are never satisfied... smh
omg the red color is hottttt
Is it sad that my mouth dropped when he said the price was $699.
Ridiculous!!!
iPhone 11: A familiar disappointment
Capitalistic brainwashing spinning  better than disc jockey
It’s ugly
Color suggestions? For the 11
We miss Jony Ivy to explain it all to us in his “aluminum” accent.
Hope y&#39;all know the iPhone 11 is the R version while the pro is the actual iPhone 11.<br>Apple just played y&#39;all
Thats odd, I got a notification for this when I dont have the notification bell clicked.. am I mad, heck no! 👊🏻
720p. It&#39;s ridiculous
Apple’s upbeat presentation did an excellent job of highlighting the advanced new features on the iPhone 11 Pro duo – all that positive energy also helped it hide some of the missing upgrades that we expected (there were even some downgrades). Here’s a rundown of the good, the bad and the ugly.<br><br>Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max and 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 11 Pro<br>Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max and 11 Pro • iPhone 11 Pro Max • iPhone 11 Pro<br><br>The Good<br>The triple camera is feature that makes these phones worth buying. The new member here is a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera (13mm or 120°). It enables 0.5x optical zoom to fit more in the photo – or the video, like the other cameras this one can record 4K video at 60fps with Extended Dynamic Range.<br><br>Apple iPhone 11 Pro upgrade: the good, the bad and the ugly<br>The 12MP telephoto camera (52mm, 2x optical zoom) gets a brighter aperture than before, f/2.0 (up from f/2.4). It features improved autofocus with focus pixels. Meanwhile, the main 12MP camera gets full coverage of focus pixels – it’s effectively a Dual Pixel AF system.<br><br>Apple did some clever things to improve the camera performance. It calibrated the three cams at the factory and made them talk to each other. So, once one camera gets a focus lock and adjusts the exposure, the other cameras can use to values to get a running start when you switch to them.<br><br>Apple iPhone 11 Pro upgrade: the good, the bad and the ugly<br>Even more clever is the upcoming Deep Fusion feature, Apple’s take on HDR+. It will use the faster and more power efficient Neural Engine to combine four short exposure shots and a long exposure enhance image quality. There’s a new Night mode as well.<br><br>Apple iPhone 11 Pro upgrade: the good, the bad and the ugly<br>The TrueDepth selfie camera matches the rear cameras – it now has a 12MP sensor (up from 7MP) with 4K/60fps video recording and extended dynamic range (capped at 30fps, though). The Smart HDR feature has been enhanced compared to the XS generation too. Also, FaceID is now 30% faster.<br><br>The battery upgrade is huge, even if not glamorous. Apple finally decided to include a fast charger with the flagship iPhones – an 18W charger with a USB-C to Lightning cable.<br><br>Apple iPhone 11 Pro upgrade: the good, the bad and the ugly<br>Battery life is improved as well. Apple doesn’t quote caoacities, but the iPhone 11 Pro lasts 4 hours longer than the iPhone XS, the iPhone 11 Pro Max beats the XS Max by 5 hours. Yes, you could use an iPad charger on older models and get fast charging, but battery longevity and faster charging will greatly improve your day to day usage of the phone.<br><br>The new body is more durable with water resistance that outstrips the typical IP68-rated phone – it can dive to 4m under water and stay there for half an hour. Android flagships are typically rated at 1.5-2m.<br><br>Apple iPhone 11 Pro upgrade: the good, the bad and the ugly<br>The Super Retina XDR display is the brightest on an iPhone and offers 800nits typical brightness (up from 625nits on the XS). It maxes out at 1,200nits when viewing HDR content (the phone supports both HDR10 and Dolby Vision). Apple improved the contrast too.<br><br>The Apple A13 Bionic chipset is both faster and more power efficient than before. It’s the fastest mobile chipset in single-core CPU performance as well as graphics. Also the beefed up Neural Engine enables the new computational photography magic in the camera.<br><br>Apple iPhone 11 Pro upgrade: the good, the bad and the ugly<br>The Bad<br>The phones may feature all-new cameras, but the low 2x zoom ratio is old news – it may have been impressive on 2016’s iPhone 7 Plus, but in 2019 3x zoom cameras are pretty common and the best of the bunch offer 5x.<br><br>The chunky notch doesn’t live up to modern beauty standards either. Other makers have moved away from wide notches, but since Apple doesn’t have an in-display fingerprint reader, it has to keep the same notch as the iPhone X for a third year in a row.<br><br>The iPad Pros launched in 2017 with 120Hz screens and given the new name and all the talk of a “Pro” screen, it is reasonable to expect something better than the age-old 60Hz refresh rate. Apple is lagging behind the competition already in a feature that will only become more widely adopted on Android phones.<br><br>No reverse wireless charging is another issue. It was never promised, but it made a lot of sense with the announcement of the new AirPod case that supports wireless charging. As it stands, Apple’s only charging-related upgrade is including the 18W brick in the box – something won’t impress even a 2015 Android flagship.<br><br>The Ugly<br>64GB base storage is a joke on a $1,000 “Pro” phone. Especially when Apple’s product lineup basically forces you to pay $150 for the upgrade to 256GB storage (there’s no 128GB option like the base iPhone 11 has). The Samsung Galaxy Note10 ($950) comes with 256GB, most Chinese makers would agree that 128GB is standard for a mid-ranger.<br><br>Apple iPhone 11 Pro upgrade: the good, the bad and the ugly<br>Keep in mind that one minute of 4K/60fps footage with HEVC encoding takes up 400MB of storage. The iPhone 11 Pros can record 4K/60 video with all four cameras – they can even do it simultaneously – but if you get a phone with 64GB storage you’ll have to use this feature sparingly.<br><br>The two iPhone 11 Pro handsets are heavier than the phones they replace – 188g vs. 177g for the Pro and 226g vs. 208g for the Pro Max. The larger model is particularly chunky, it’s one of the heaviest phones to be announced recently. Also note that the bezels are slightly wider.<br><br>The Pros are thicker too, likely to accommodate the larger battery. But it’s the double camera bump that looks pretty ugly – the square sticks out of the back, then each individual camera sticks out of the square.<br><br>Apple iPhone 11 Pro upgrade: the good, the bad and the ugly<br>Losing 3D Touch is a downgrade on a phone that’s supposed to be an improvement. Not everyone loved the feature, but still it was used by many as an intuitive way to navigate certain UI elements. Also, it was present only on the premium iPhones and not the “affordable” XR.<br><br>The outlook<br>The triple camera has impressive features and we&#39;re sure the image quality will be great too. Also, the fast charger will be life-changing for long-time Apple users who have never known anything better than 5W. If there are two features that should convince you the Apple iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max are worth it, the camera and the charger are it (the longer battery life is great as well).<br><br>Other than that, the phones feel like iPhone XSS. For starters, the displays are the same size and resolution as last year. Yes, the A13 is the fastest mobile chipset ever, but as Apple itself said, the A12 is still faster than Android&#39;s best - if you have an iPhone XS, the A13 is not a reason to upgrade. Also, the water resistance up to 4m sounds great, but Apple&#39;s terms and conditions state that it degrades over time and it likely won&#39;t honor water damage warranty.<br><br>The equation changes if you have an older iPhone, but not as much as you may think. Even the iPhone X has a screen just as sharp as the 11 Pro, the same optical zoom, a very fast chipset and (if you buy an iPad charger) fast charging.<br><br>So, the question really becomes &quot;is the new camera worth $1,000?&quot;. $1,150, really, because living with 64GB storage is the opposite of a &quot;Pro&quot; experience.
شي عربي هون يقولي عم سعر الايفون باليورو لو سمحتو
If i switch from Iphone xs to 11 (not pro), would that be a good upgrade or more of a downgrade? i wont really spend any money if i sell my xs online for about the same price as 11 so should I do it?
No amoled display this time ??
another expensive junk !
أريد مشتركين بقناتى ممكن تساعدونى👍🔔
You wrote that the iPhone 11 is cheaper than the XR. But that isnt correct? At least its not in sweden. In sweden the XR is like 150 dollars cheaper.
Why go for an  iphone 11 if u can buy a cheap one motorola one with the same screen design and back camera design!
literally no one : <br><br><br><br>iphone 11 : 🎛
Guess I&#39;ll be waiting another 10-11mo. for iPhone 12.. I&#39;m sure that one will be epic along with the watch. This your last chance Apple 🍎
I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this. The bezels are huge.
This is sad, apple is crumbling down in the deep, wtf
My friend every year explaining me why he&#39;s gonna upgrade: <br><b>THEY CHANGED THE GODDAMN CAMERA! WHOOO!!</b>
A LCD screen is acceptable but 720p is what really holds me back. I would ideally want 1440p but I&#39;d be will to do 1080p if the price is right. 720p in 2019 is just not good enough for a flagship product.
720p lol
don’t forget to buy that new iphone with your apple card, excuse me apple pay. get that 3% cash back
Apple watch: actually a good product<br><br>They listened to their customers about the always on display feature <br><br>And a new useful international emergency call feature.<br><br><br>IPhone: good ecosystem but<br><br>Same ugly notch every.single.year.<br><br>And good luck cleaning the dust off of the sides of these cameras.<br><br>Also no USB-C.
No type c charge port nahhh
the rubbish
They&#39;re still using that notch. smh. its 2019 people
Wonder why iPhone got bumped by the competition? Oh, that&#39;s right. Big reveal of same phones year after year. Then all the extras you have to buy and live in that ecosystem! My goodness apple. Step up and keep up....
So it&#39;s a cheesy mini camera phone so you can do blogging. Nothing elese.
Is the screen resolution really 720p?
2017 🚥<br>2018 🚦<br>2019 🎛<br>2020 🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛<br>2021🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛
Come on guys, get this man to 10mil
Is it worth to upgrade from 7 plus?
thank u for the review, always to the point
Lol still has a notch.
Where is the “innovation” they’ve teasing about?!
828 x 1792,  326 ppi display in 2019 ?
the intro song tho
did i hear that correctly, camera is 4k and the screen is 720p?
Please subscribe  in my channel and thanks ❤️<br>to pure hearts  ❤️
Weird he is not mad about the price.<br>The whole internet is still mad.
No matter how ugly it looks, people are still gonna buy it for the logo and status symbol
And this is why I still have a 6s. Nothing new besides the camera, looks, and useless features. Hopefully the 5G next next doesn’t disappoint. I mean I guess they’re smart because snobby high school and college kids will buy it regardless
Moment lenses is trembling
I want to buy it but it’s £729 in the uk which is stupid
&quot;The same.&quot; Lol is essentially the overview of this video.
So everything is the same just the camera? Damn... innovation
I guess apple didn&#39;t get the message that Samsung is literally kicking their ass rn . . . But iPhones with sell no matter what because  of clout value
هلو
S10+ is the winner.
I’ll stick to my xs max. It looks classier than this but between this phone and the note 10 plus, I’d get the note 10 plus😁
So i can show my XR to anybody and say it’s the iPhone 11. Cool 🥳
Marques, you said “slowfie” over 105k times! Wow, you’re really making it happen! 😂
Sucks i&#39;m switching to a Samsung Good bye apple!
Dear god that notch...yuck.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=152">2:32</a> If the wide angle camera shows like this,then is just crap! He&#39;s like an alien there! 😅😅<br>Then, &quot;automatic night mode&quot; without the possiblity to turn it on/off when you want? What the hell?!
ugly camera of iphone 11
Dude brought his iMac Pro on a plane with him 😂
Watch people buy just because it’s new
Nah my dude, it is not like a go pro. I&#39;ve taken my GP way deep. Snuba diving in the Bahamas, not even close to the GP
Wtf lol. Looks like the old iPhone 3G I had from the front. What&#39;s with that massive bezel. Glad I switched to samsung. Note 10+ ftw
Same o same o
Why can the cheapest phone maker out there fit the outdated Mt. Everest like cameras in their phones with no bump, yet Iphone cant fit what the call top of the line camera Hardware in the phone without making a bump that takes off your head when you turn it.
Galaxy S10 and Note 10 win.
Lol the notch..
Yo I still have the iPhone 7 Plus 🤷🏻‍♀️
Bye Apple 👋🏻
next year we’re gonna have a full on stove with 4 cameras on the 12 pro
honestly i dont like the camera design on these phones. even when huawei started coming out with 3 lens phones to me it just looked ugly. sad to see apple is doing the same. hopefully they start working on a new technology where they can include all different functions in one lens.
Feel sorry for you apple people stuck with ONE company unlike android that gives many to choose  from.... enjoy your small phone with no really wow factor over the competition.... apple had really lost its wow.... no one cares about your phones as they use too... lame
I love this
I&#39;m fine with an s10e thanks though
Both phones are really good but samsungs 3 camera design is wayy better tbh
Just UGLY !
The camera of the iPhone has gone through mitosis over the years, from I phone 4 camera to iPhone X camera to now. That’s why it’s called the cell phone
Really they still made iPhones???
Apple could sell a bag of dirt and ppl would buy it
Steve jobs where you at
I can&#39;t wait for Samsung&#39;s latest burn promotion video.
I can sell my iPhone X for 400€ and buy an iPhone 11 for 400€ (800€ in EU). If I do so I get 1 year for free of Apple TV+ and I can stop paying Netflix (150€ / year). So the iPhone 11 = 250€. Im getting consumist or this is an intelligent decision?
Your breaking my hart arse wipe lol
Долбоебы бегом за кредитами!😂
Nothing big deal..
No 7 on trending
°Dark mode... It looks like they just dim down the brightness, and it&#39;s not a new thing even windows phones had it back in the day, <br>°Night mode... Been there on Android for a couple of years<br>°Wide Angle camera, almost every android had then since last years models<br>°720p display lmao<br>°Battery not a lot of info on them... Probably the same as last year&#39;s.... 3000mha...galaxy s8 had that one couple of years ago <br>°bionic13 no doubt is fast, the 11,and 12 were fast too, but iPhone&#39;s OS has no multi-tasking whatsoever making it pointless... <br><br>The only reason to upgrade is because is $50cheaper than the current XR and the wide angle camera to catch up with the current market , the rest is marketing bullshit...
<b>triggered android fans have entered the chat</b>
Does the 11 (R) support gigabit lte?  I know the XR didn’t.
You used the slofie again
Meh sticking to the 6S. Looks the same. Just a minor upgrade. New specs. And a new camera. Waiting for Next year. It should be called the iPhone 10SS. As it’s still the same body. I miss the days when it was a new body every 2 years and an S upgrade. We’ve had the same body for 3 years in fact probably 4 years.
تسترو علينه خايب يوميه مطلعينه نوعيه  فلك لصابكم  نشالله
The iPhone 5 body with a full screen notch would literally be the perfect iPhone
I&#39;m not buying a new iphone until I can get Touch ID again. I don&#39;t like this face scanning bullshit.
So they only increase the camera and prices... And middle the logo 👻
google pixel 4 better
Samsung would never do this
Apple is like, our users are blind anyway so lower resolution in not a problem
lol.... let me get this straight. this is the year 2019. and apple is selling 720p screens... like the iphone 4 from... 9 years ago?<br>Yeah... no wonder it runs this long, it has basically nothing to work for. LOL.
A 720p LCD in 2019 for $700? That just doesn&#39;t cut it anymore, i don&#39;t care how big of an Apple fanboy you are.
720p YEAH BOI     2      0     1      9
I can already see everyone not being able to take pictures with flash because of that frosted glass cracking.
Yall stop using apple
&quot;That probably the first and last time ill ever say that name out loud...&quot; don&#39;t kid yaself
ugliest phone
720p is horrible in 2019
Super aweosme video. crisp , concise , perfect....
I get goose bumps looking at the two dots at the back.
To all people complaining about how this phone looks ugly, you must know that pretty much any change in the design with any object will be precieved as weird &amp;/or ugly by buyers until three years later when all companies in that field use the same design for their produce and peolle get  used to it &amp; start viewing the old design as weird &amp; ugly, and i say this a samsung user and lover.
Im still waiting to hear whats PRO about it
Still have s7 lol might get note 10 MIGHT😏
the design is the same so how can people see that i have the new iphone??
I’m upgrading from a iPhone 7. Idk which to get.. help? I just like taking selfies on a daily basis but I’m not a blogger or anything. There’s only a 600 pixel difference between iPhone 11 and pro.. but for 400$ more
Lol they relaunch same phone 🤣 rubbish
Am I the only one who actually loves the design? 👀🤔
Iphone camera went from 🚥 and 🚦to 🎛️.
I love you man! You’re by for the best tech YouTube channel in my opinion. So professional. Good job man we really are thankful for your channel!
Apple really didn&#39;t want it to be iPhone 9/11.<br>So they made it 11, 11 pro and 11 pro max instead of 9, 11 and 11 max.
The camera design is difereent and beautiful..
you&#39;re ecoing
Do you really believe that this is a device which fits into 2019? I&#39;d say Apple is going more into subscription services then their iPhones.
So it’s literally the same as the XR but with 3 cams.. The XS max has a better screen than the 11 also?
Mkbhd here
Completely forgot about the ridiculous battery claims
I wouldn&#39;t mind if they just called it an istove
I don&#39;t understand why ppl keeps buying these things....
I have the 8+ but I want a upgrade so should I just get the XR or 11? I’m hearing a lot of people say they’re basically the same anyways
he said the word „same“ so many times in the first 90 seconds. so why not buy the Xr
Hey <br>Plaese make a video about the new ipad  and think you😄
Like fidget spinner
Why the fuck do they only have 720p..... whyyyyyyy
Another stupidphone
Slow-fies dafaq<br>Would be better if they call it Self-mo
I can&#39;t believe how thick those bezels are.
Is it lcd display?
Apple - we moved the logo down<br>Apple fans - wooow
I have a dilemma.. what you think is better between the iphone xs and the iphone 11? I really don’t know which one to buy..i love photography and mainly i am upgrading from my old iphone 6s for this reason. I know both of those are an huge step ahead mine but i would like to buy what is considered the better one. I seen the iphone 11 has better photo features but at the same time the iphone xs has better display resolution etc.. considered i could have them at the same price what you advice me to buy?<br>Thanks to whoever will help me out with this choice
I&#39;m gonna buy the note so I can charge my iphone11 on the back of it
I don’t want it I have the max I’m straight
Which one is best for buying plz suggest
Teethbrush, fidget spinner.. whats next apple?
You got big hands man that phone looks tiny
Apple 2019 64 GB for a &quot;camera&quot; phone <br>Meanwhile my Note 10+ has 1.024 Terabyte storage and saves RAW Pictures xD
Not  good
Apple trying to compete with the samsung s8.
Hi marcus
Really don’t care iPhone 11 is very boring no point upgrading
Everything Great ...But when r we going to get CALL RECORDING option free in I PHONES
Are people actually buying this?
My iPhone 6s Plus has a 1080p screen while that has a 720p screen😂😂😂
Apple could sell a cucumber for $2000
I&#39;m finally buying Samsung
no 5G = NOT BUYING.
Can we all please team up and go to the video Apple uploaded and dislike it?!?!?!?!! They need to see that we are not happy with their dumb innovations.
So much awesome tech in theses iPhones. Miles ahead of android in terms of polished and new technologies.. BUT I do wish the design was new and squared off like the iPad Pro instead of regurgitation of the iPhone X/XS design.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=278">4:38</a>   HOW DOES HE HAVE 3 HandS??
Why did iphone make this!? Im swiching to Android maybe
apple in 2019: here is the wide angle camera gays this is innovation<br>mi: hold my bear
It started off as an April fools joke... Then the truth was revealed.
jobs is crying in the hell
For all the photographers out there... does anyone else wish the 26mm equiv. lens was closer to 35mm?
Watching this with my note10+ and thinking Damm does iPhone have a phone case or something.. Look at them bezels. Lol. What a shit looking iPhone.
I have saved enough money to buy<br>iPhone<br><br><br>5S
830€ for an LCD-display phone... in 2019 FFS... nope.... nope,nope,nope... I&#39;ll stick with my oneplus 7 (500€) with amoled display, thank you.
I was expecting ultrasonic sensor and punch hole design. hate notch bye
Not that I’m advocating for this but why do people care about a “cute” camera or phone and not what it can do? Just curious lol. I’m not upgrading.
720p lol

The most hype is the camera, you can buy any reflex camera and cheap
I was the one to see his video 1st of IPhone 11 pro
SAMSUNG NOTE I AM COMING FOR YOU
That beam thing you were talking about it being the &quot;1st&quot; in that phone is not! <br>Samsung was the 1st one to have the beam passing thing years ago
Man, those sheep will be so happy! BAAAAAAA
The ugliest iPhone ever doesn’t matter what it has 🥀
Why did they move that logo down??<br>It’s hard to say something at this point but seems to be ugly!
iPhone 11-- guys give me 700$ dollar for nothing. <br>isheep- here you go...
It&#39;s the fugliest iPhone in history
Same same...but different...but still same!!<br><b>*insert meme here*</b>
Garbage
i dont even own any iphone, just wondering what caught their interest buying every single series of iphone..can any iphone user answer this ?
People demands and speak about innovation, but the majority can’t solve a differential equation....if you want innovation then just do it by yourself. Then you will understand what innovation is. <br><br>Also the majority doesn’t understand that is all about milking almost the same products by just polishing the design. This is business and science, not charity. With all de disadvantages of iOS, still is the best phone os. Too bad is super isolated system.
With iOS 13 Face ID is supposed to be 30% faster already for X/XR/XS, so does this mean the 11 and 11 Pro will be 60% faster?
The camera is undergoing mitosis every year 🤣
Dear apple what the people want is better battery life and a notch free phone not that big square on the back from the phone you need few ideas hit me up I’ll help you out this shit has to stop you in 1st place for ugly phone hit me me up I’ll get you out this mess you in
if I was in the market for a new iPhone I would get the 11.
Worst iphone ever... Apple should maintain values otherwise it will become like blackberry
People complain its design and missed the fact that there isn&#39;t much progress and potential for the future. Well apple is focusing on making profit out of movies and game following sony&#39;s foot step
TF apple_🙄🤥🤥
720P screen resolution in 2019! WTF apple? Moreover, very ugly design(both front with big notch and back with stove!)..
I love iphone but man.this iphone looks like gas stove 😣😣😣
Not good
Camera setup is look like gas stove ☹️☹️☹️
What rubbish is this, still u have to appreciate  it😂😂😂
6S users where you at?
Apple is out of ideas. Upgrading the camera is the last thing I care about with a new smart phone
Shots whenever he says &quot;Same&quot;... anyone?!
I will stick with my iPhone x for next two years.
بدي 😥😥
Next video from Tim Cook: How to cook on the iPhone cameras...
I don&#39;t use the camera a lot, so one single camera is good enough for me
So 11 is a bigger number than 10 so logically iPhone 11 is supposed to be better yet it has lower resolution than the X lol.
iPhone unboxing parody on my channel, please watch it and share
So I like a good camera I don&#39;t need 2 or 3 just 1 good one. You should do a survey: do people really want this many cameras?¿
Now it’s not an apple again, it changed to a Pineapple coz the camera lol
Apple: “and a brand new revolutionary feature! We added another camera bump!”
I would hate any phone if it had 720p right now. It&#39;s just personal preference.
C6 Corvette nice..
Watching on my s10+,loving my phone ....clearly no innovation from apple
I have one big question for you, I have an iPhone X, would I be upgrading or downgrading if I switched to the 11? My only fears are the screen and the thickness....
Same thing I will past
I m fed up with that shity look every year same looks 😠
بس حبيت اقوول يا حليلك😭😭
Tech nerds go for spec but a normal user who want something generel good overall take this!
Let&#39;s be real it&#39;s ugly
MKBHD: I was kinda hoping for maybe a slightly different design ... or something a bit more modern feeling <br>Apple: We don&#39;t do that here
I used to  not like Iphones, now I feel sorry for them..<br>This looks outdated with the huuuge notch and camera bumps, are people still buying Iphones?
What a joke.
I’ll probably keep using my 6s + until they stop supporting it
ITS SOOOO DAMN UGLYY HAHAHHAH
&quot;You just got beamed some memes.&quot; - iPhone 11
I don&#39;t think this is a tech channel anymore coz he makes like one video a week and that too is not that good anymore.
Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave. This is pathetic! Don’t call it a pro when there’s no 5g capability, no USB-C, no airpod  reverse charging, longer lasting battery, the base capacity should start at 128gb.
That price drop is only in the us tho&#39; the PRO is in my country, which is Belgium, around 1329€ (+/- 1452,66 USD) for a 256GB non Max model. That&#39;s still very steep...
&quot;Everything is pretty much the same, except they moved the logo and the camera looks a bit different. It kinda looks like any other iPhone at this point.&quot;<br><br>Apple: <b>By innovation only!</b>
Bro WTF they took the iphone X and made it look like is has 2 buttholes now
My company stopped supporting Galaxies and now only low-end iPhones are available. I&#39;m turning down replacement every year not to end up with XR or this thing. I prefer to hang on to my S8. <br>This just looks cheap.
Hey could y’all help me out what color should I get?
Seriously, what do they think? The Appleheads will just buy a new phone bcuz it has a better camera ?
Anyone still got a regular iPhone 6? lmao
After steve jobs there are everything except innovation
It ugly tho
that notch is embarrassing
Nothing more than new feature other than upgrading camera, I am a iPhone lover but this is one of the ugliest phone in the world.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=71">1:11</a> respect to that man
... is officially official.&quot; Yes haha, i love it
Got an 8plus two years ago. Still no reason to upgrade when the “upgrade” isn’t different at all. Cameras are the LEAST of my concerns
Mark-ass Brownlee
If im actually gonna buy this, what color should I get?
Ugly asf but you better believe i’m still getting it 😂
Garbo
They took the word &quot;iphone&quot; off of the back.<br><br>That&#39;s hands down the best feature of the phone.
720p LCD ScreenThat show budget get better 699$ get a better Android for that money If talk about overprice are this the most expensive budget mobile on market lot of crap if not just Not Criticize that 🤔
iPhone 11 Pro cameras gonna trigger some people&#39;s trypophobia.
Steve Jobs would be disappointed
For me it&#39;s not a beautiful lens 🤢 i love the UI
🗑️
All these people complaining are the same ones who would still buy the iphone if it was a potato..
Love them or hate them. IPhone knows how to sell phones. By making subtle name changing like the XR to the base iphone 11, they know they will still sell the XR. <br><br>I&#39;m about to go buy some apple stock damnit lol
The iPhone that I would buy, instead of $300 more Pro.
IPhone Camera’s Be Like: 🔘 🚥 🚦 🎛
2-way Fidget Spinner
Samsung had that camera feature before apple. but we all know isheep will say iPhone made it first
Apple&#39;s got a cheese grater, a trash can, a banana stand and now an electric stove apparently. If we say that the iPad is a cutting board, all we need now is a kitchen sink.
It&#39;s 2019 and the iPhone still has that huge notch 🤦🏻‍♂️
My XS max will be the last iPhone I need for a while... Apples updates are so predictable and unexciting these days...
I still have an Iphone 7 Plus I guess it&#39;s time to upgrade now that night mode is a thing. Every Iphone that comes out doesn&#39;t really have that many changes so I never have the urge to go splurge on a phone unless it changes the game. Which the wide camera angle and the night mode is something new and not a bad price.
It looks so thick
Iphone 11 868 pixels.. not even full hd.. pathetic apple
still no multi tasking lol
The fact that Apple said “all new design” about the iPhone 11, makes them lose all credibility with me. They literally lie in people’s faces and NO ONE DOES ANYTHING ABOUT IT. They even said “all screen display” AGAIN and it’s NOT!! Lmao!! They KNOW they’re in the wrong and that explains why they always disable comments on their YouTube videos. They don’t want people exposing them for the bullshit company they actually are. Tim Cook is about the money...not the innovation.
Why do people who hate apple even watch (and comment on this)? lol. What a waste of time LUL
It will still be over 800eur in Europe. Here the iPhones are so overpriced it makes zero sense to buy one.
Still 720p...
Marques gift me one ☝️ please, I want it but can’t afford 😁😁
I don’t get it. This phone looks amazing.
Looks so ordinary.. &amp; that notch! I mean com on apple!!! 🤐
People say it doesn’t looks good,but I disagree:3
People talking about the camera: 90%<br>People who care about the actual features: 10%
I think a missed feature in iOS13 is unlocking your phone with your voice. If I say “hey Siri” on my phone, my phone is the only one that responds. Why can’t that also be applied to unlocking the phone. I was love to say “hey Siri open Spotify” and it just do it instead of saying that I have to unlock my phone first.
people will buy apple product no matter what they sell.
The stove has overtaken slofie
Well the phone is same, so he made the video different.... There r so many people in the set...
IMO, since I&#39;ve watched the video, yes I have my own opinions on the iPhone 11, especially since I&#39;ve never owned an iPhone. But through out the many years I&#39;ve played around with every model. LoL!! I have a 16 nephew so you know what that means. It&#39;s a high school symbol status which I&#39;ve never quite understood. Nor can I get a direct answer from him or his friends. 😏😂<br>To me this isn&#39;t worth the upgrade if you have last years flagship , especially for the price. Apple needs to stop putting out old gimmicks that Android has had forever and release a lot if not all into all the variants that year and not make their faithful iPhone fan base keep having to upgrade. I found it VERY strange that Apple would put camera features do far away from the app itself that the user needs to go into another while setting window to access these features. Major fail on Apple&#39;s end. The A Bionic chip is going to be amazing and is an amazing chip. But that&#39;s about it that amazed me about this phone. By putting on a max of a 720 display, it&#39;s not exactly what I would want for the distance Apple has come and again ..... the price. But on the flip side of things the liquid retina display on iPhones in general always in my opinion looked great for Apple users.<br>My major issue I got out of this video that concerned me was with the ultra sonic bluetooth file transfer.  It flung to be great for Apple users that have never seen this done before. So it should be pretty amazing to see on an Apple device for those users but I think it&#39;s going to open a huge window for 0days and ways to possible do MITM attacks. Who knows Apple&#39;s system is pretty locked down. I might be 100% wrong making that assumption so early but it&#39;s interesting to see where and how far this phone takes itself in sales, updates and user feedback.<br><b>But seriously</b> And I really mean this.<br>I&#39;m really beginning to hate reading through the comments on YouTube channels. Almost ANY genre now. It&#39;s always seems like young impressionable kids arguing over the smallest, dumbest and repetitively keep throwing jabs at each other over &quot;fanboy this vs fanboy that&quot; Everyone in the tech world KNOWS we have Apple and Android users. But we also have these damn trolls it seems like  who love to ruin the comment sections. On a database forum online these people would be banned. Someone please explain why it&#39;s necessary to have 100 posts in 20 threads all saying the same thing slightly different but the same argument, which is nonsense from the beginning. Or lots of  majorly off topic comments. Off topic questions happen but it shouldn&#39;t over take from the videos comments. We need to stick to the video and the videos content it would eliminate more than half of all the comments throughout YouTube. <br>Sorry for the rant.
Looks like china phone the design is not good particular the camera
Hmm let me take 4k footage for my 720p screen
No 5G
So you can get the fastest Android on the market OnePlus 7pro or the worst iPhone, think people
Their event was called &#39;by innovation only&#39; hahahahahaha haha, what a joke
This iphone is just like me, nothing special.
Will stick to my iPhone X
Memebeam
so they pretty much selling you 1 small camera for $700 dollars ok
That&#39;s an ugly ass phone
Apple Event . Here 3 New models with ugliest Design We have ever Made and new innovation Camera Bla Camera Blaaa Blaaa Blaaaaa 🤣🤣🤣 <br>isheeep Reaction. Wooow Woooow Woooow 🤣🤣🤣<br>WTF
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=280">4:40</a> Ninja on the right?
Everyone talking bad about this iPhone. Yet ur still gonna buy it...
So grateful to have iPhone XS max and I’m so happy that I didn’t like this stove😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=153">2:33</a> what is he doing  😂😂
Same junk, ugly bulky dated design looks trash R.I.P apple.
720p res 😂😂😂 what a joke man 🤣
Apple is targeting Indians
I’d take this over the pro
It’s the same thing with that new camera. And it’s ugly 🤦‍♀️
iPhones have become like FIFA video game, every single year “new” release, yet it is exactly the same shit phone with minor “tweaks/updates”.
Not worth the money
💩💩💩
So the same shit budget iPhone XR, but now it’s called the iPhone 11, so they can rip off people by offering 2 PRO in different sizes.
apple is losing the game 😶😶😶
Someone should just list the specs of a bunch of 2016-2019 phones and compare them to the iPhone 11. Should settle some of the debate.
What about the storage?
Apple is just fooling around with people.
What&#39;s the name of the Jordyn Edmonds intro song?
tbh I honestly don’t mind the iPhone 11, it’s at a great price and the colors are gorgeous.
My s10 has a fucking better screen than that garbage and better camera
Everyone is getting mad about the design and saying how it’s so ugly but people are still gonna but it lol 😂
Why is noone talking about the naming though?!? I feel like that&#39;s the biggest announcement this year. The &quot;cheap&quot; I phone is the &quot;main&quot; IPhone now. Last year Xr was the cheap iPhone. This year it&#39;s the 11 Pro that is the expensive iPhone. The 11 is just an iPhone
Changes made with the camera... and people already hate it for its looks, typical. I&#39;m not even an iPhone user 😂
Big deal 👎
<b>Good one Mr. Markass!!!!</b>
Flop!
I just got a Note 10 ad at the beginning of this vid....... Bruh 😂
They say its cheaper than the xr. I just bought my xr 2months ago .;(((
Guess I&#39;ll stick to Huawei
Steve Jobs gave you new and innovative products... The new liberal idiot gives you different color iPhones released every three months.
Biggest company in the world and they’re running out of ideas? This is what they came up with?
Bye apple I started using in 2008 with the 3g but no more I gonna try the note 10+
Too little too late. R.i.p Apple
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=278">4:38</a> Not only his camera has a Tripod !! Lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=138">2:18</a> Jon on the other side...doing his review !! Lol
Does it have a headphone jack tho
Please give some type c haha...
Apple CEO: &quot;what now?&quot;<br>Worker: &quot;Samsung show 5 new flagships, LG tries multi screen phone, Asus build gaming phone, what should we do?&quot;<br>Apple CEO: &quot;Add ugly camera&quot;<br>Worker: &quot;Sir, you are genius!&quot;
Apple can sell a brick and it would sell
How come every review I see of an Apple product, when the downsides/lack of features are talked about it&#39;s always &quot;fine&quot;...<br><br>Like every other tech product it&#39;s &quot;this poor value&quot; or &quot;this is a deal breaker&quot; but with Apple products it&#39;s always just &quot;fine&quot;...<br><br>Just demonstrates the pervasiveness of Apple brainwashing. Like come on... it&#39;s not pathetic that they&#39;re just now offering 2 cameras on the base model? (Samsung already offers 3 on their base model galaxy)
So basically, trying to catch up with android
its horrible
I’m so happy that there’s a new iphone! <br><br>I’ll definitely buy the iphone 7plus now.
Nothing more innovative <br><br><br><br>@apple
the phone is absolutly unexciting.
Jobs: WTF
Everyone be like &#39;iphone 11 is so ugly&#39;, &#39;but the lilac one is cute&#39;
The cameras at the back looks like a machine gun barrel ( iPhone pro)
Eggphone 0
They are just manipulating with those cameras. They didn&#39;t done anything wow upgrades. Just same phone as iPhone X . Still there is a notch, which is outdated. Which they didn&#39;t figure it out to no notch. And that iPhone 11 bezels are very huge. Which look very bad for that price phone.
iPhone camera: 🔘=🔘🔘=🚦= 🎛
I have loved Iphone since 3gs but now I think we can part ways .......hello Huawei
WHAT A HORRENDOUS LOOKING PHONE! FOR 2019 APPLE IS SERIOUSLY LAGGING IN LOT&#39;S OF AREA&#39;S!
Still 720P lmao
Cell phone design is dead, according to this. What happened with 5g? If you want to loose the market, make another rectangular phone again. I pay a lot for cell phones, so I’m waiting for a big improvement. And this is no it. I’m disappointed.
720p display 2019 🤣🤣🤣
Next video from Jerryrigeverything: How to cook on the iPhone camera...
Next video from Apple: How to cook on the iPhone camera...
Nobody :<br>Android fans: iPhone 11 PROblem😂😂😂
Give me😂😂😂😂
Bhai ipad dilwa de
No one has been looking faward to night mode, the phone doesnt look nice and is lagging behind Samsung in a hek of alot of areas imo, its a simplified phone that limits u in hardware and software and locks u into a limited eco system. And is overpriced. Imo
720p resulation which is like a 700$ gurbage
Waiting for iPhone 42 having 100 cameras
Tell me what really changed? New cameras and new screensavers? Everything seems to be! Apples become a boring, monotonous device. The market is already not so much in demand for these phones! Now there is much more powerful devices and more diverse!
Xxx
All these people saying its ugly. Come on, really.. I&#39;d love to see what there phones look like. Proberly dealing with cracked screens,  chipped edges you name it. 😂
Apple iphone 11: Still has the irritating notch <br><br>Marques: Ah shit ! here we go again
all the same in these apples! Boring!<br>всё одно и тоже в этих яблоках! Скучно!
I feel like the audio sync was off.. maybe I&#39;m wrong tho I dunno
Such and overrated phone
I’ll keep my iPhone 8 for a cheaper phone bill lol
Roses are red<br>Violets are blue<br>I&#39;m here for kidney memes<br>So are you
iPhone Camera: 🔘=🔘🔘=🚦=🎛
The iPhone camera said:  “🎛”
That notch thou
&quot;New iPhone&quot; haha 😂
next year it is going to be A14 chip the following year A15 chip and so on. WTF
if you have the iphone X then this is a useless purchase nothing new except for that crazy didget spinner camera. I have iphone 7 (3 years ago) and been wating for this one but now idk maybe ill stick to my iphone 7 ...
How oldschool those iPhones look compared to other flagship devices. Rly funny that apple thinks they don&#39;t need to change the design at all.......
omg<br>this is shit<br>hahahaha<br>wdf<br>720p lcd again<br>improved ugliness<br>hahahaha
নোয়াখালী থেকে কে কে দেখছো?
Am I the only one who actually likes the design of the iPhone. I&#39;d love to upgrade from my iPhone 7 but I don&#39;t use my phone for much intensive techy stuff. Probably going to wait on the next model purely for value reasons as the 7 will be close to being discontinued by them.
That’s worse ! When becomes Heated they will drop FPS FCK iPhone X UP!!!
It looks like a Portia spider
Lets ban Samsung now , Samsung Note 10 + is  better than Iphone&#39;s itrash . Donald trump  get on this !
iPhone 2023: 🎛  🎛<br><br>And they will still refuse to show the phone front in their ads since they’re ashamed to confess they can’t get rid of the notch
Trump: well then, Let&#39;s ban Samsung to make Iphone great again
Pretty sure I know which phone is going to get the &#39;Biggest bust of the year&#39; award at the end of the year.
The only design concern are the BEZELS for the 11, as you have used it in person. is it any smaller than the XR...???
Finally, Apple is back on 2018. <br>Happy New Year Apple.
It was nice to see they gave the 5C another chance.
what&#39;s the difference between iPhone 10 and iPhone 11? absolutely nothing
Welcome to 2017, Apple.
M afraid Steve Jobs is complaining in his grave
Ok somethings not right , you say it’s $699 but on the British website it’s £729. It should be £566 if it’s the same price as the American version, so either  you Americans do some weird thing with tax or there ripping off every user in the uk
Yo it’s nothing but suckers on this planet. They keep releasing phones and dumb ass niggaz keep buying em. <br><br>The phones should come out every couple of years or so, obviously they last longer than a year and don’t change much. <br><br>Fuck apple, greedy cockroaches ...but the people buying this crap like crackheads every year.  <br><br>Why do you have to have the latest phone? <br><br>Do you feel happy now? <br><br>Is your life better? <br><br>Do people like you more now? <br><br>This shit is corny, that’s a fact.
That notch is fuckin disgusting
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpJouUyLBM&amp;t=345">5:45</a> i use an android and i wish it had the air drop functionality. I find this is one of the more useful features of the iPhone/iOS ecosystem.
