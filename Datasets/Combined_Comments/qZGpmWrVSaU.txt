It is a huge company, it&#39;s the funded Chinese communist company, that&#39;s HUGE!
Literally caught with Spyware delivered with their electronic devices sending info back to the Chinese government.. That just might be worth mentioning? 🤷
Long live Huawei!!!!!
A follow-up video on this subject would be smash. Please and thank you. Kindly

I feel inlove with Hauwei Phones when i first got an honor 9 I was blown away by the performance. I was a hardcore Microsoft fan before. I&#39;ve had a few samsung devices. I am so amazed at hauwei. I currently own the hauwei p30lite, Funny I&#39;m actauly getting a mate 20 pro beucase it was cheap and the battery on my p30 lite is about to explode since it&#39;s expanding. I think what hauwei is doing is super amazing. It&#39;s 2023 and I can&#39;t wait to try harmony os. I&#39;m anti apple and I would never buy any apple products but I will say apple macbooks do look good. Huawei&#39;s laptops actaully look very simialr to a macbook which I love. I hope hauwei continues to be strong and who knows. us might revert back and things will be great a again.
Trump was the best president
Hi Love
Huawei surpass the apple sale.. Thats all..
Huwawei was killing apple and other us products...  Security issue is b.s.. even facebook collects data of users and stores in data bases within US jurisdiction 💁🏻‍♂️🐒
Update: They sure regret doing it now.
Bro,<br>Will Huawei Y9 prime 2019 receive updates now?<br>Coz I have a Y9 prime 2019!<br>So if an update comes will it remove google!?😮
Why using Huawei use apple oor Samsung
So the greatest spy country of the world, got mad of being spyed?<br>Hmmm
The king is back👏👏👏
Huawei is still alive and well the P60 pro is a beast of a phone
Huawei just announced their new phones recently.
Please review the Mate 60 Pro!
4 years later, Huawei literally destroys the warmongers.
I&#39;m here after their comeback
Its 2023 kids and Huawei just made one of the biggest come backs ever with the mate 60 pro
Under such a severe and extreme blockade by the United States, Huawei has unveiled a new mobile phone with its own 5g chip and operating system, not one phone, but three. At the moment they look a lot more attractive than the iphone 15, on September 25th there will be a new product launch in Huawei, and I hear there will be other new cell phones. This is incredible! The United States has tried its best but has not been able to stop Huawei, which is just a Chinese private company, the failure of the United States&#39; efforts to prevent China&#39;s continued development in recent years is not so surprising.
huawei : hello we are back ! 😘🇨🇳
I would never buy a Huawei smartphone without the Google Player store. I have a new black Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra 512Gb smartphone abd its an excellent smartphone!!! 😆😊
yea complicated topic but basically china getting better at capitalisms and usa being a hypocrite about it. they are better now their army getting better with a lot of policing on oceans. huge economy and USA is worried about it.  At some point they will invade and they will say what to do to world.
huawei the best smartphone brand imo
2023 Huawei is back , with its own chips and OS😊
hahaha, 4 years later you was right on point, but I wonder what you think about the new Huawei P60. You got skills man.....
and 4 years later🎉
Just let u know mate60 is back with Kirn 9000s!
huawei comes back with mate60 pro with 5G and made-in-china soc!
Huawei Mate 60 launched with kirin 9000s
waway
If huawei was banned why honor wasnt banned? Now im confused
Would love to see an MKBHD update / take on where Huawei are at now etc
Stupidest thing to have ever happened. I LOVED the Mate 20 Pro..If Huawei was still easily available I would never have bought another smart phone period. I traded my mate 20 for a S21 FE and it was the dumbest thing I could&#39;ve done. I literally still miss that phone to this day. Samsung is overrated, they&#39;re far from the best.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😅
4 years later huawei still produces
Huawei was about to kill the competition. What a shame
guys want to know huawei is a cut apple this logo
I remember the bravis phone there was google there was also prestige 👑 and meizu 🎈
Best to call them Huawei as &quot;Who Are we&quot;
Such bullshit and so unfair
P20 still getting updates to this day
When you cant beat them..ban them
Mines fucked n sky are in with em too... everyone know China got chip contract from Putin invasion
I HATE TRUMP😠😠😠🤬🤬🤬
safe to say dey did it W huawei
americans thinking china has time time to care about them....
Typical Americans who have been spying on us for over 50 years blame a company that is technologically overtaking US tech so they shut them out. Once again when free markets don&#39;t work to the US advantage they change the rules.
3 years from then, here&#39;s some changes I still have my P30 pro totally supported with latest software, the Kirin 980 is a beast I left Apple for Huawei I started with the p10 Plus till the P30 pro , they built the Harmony Os Ecosystem that is shining each year , they are upgrading their App gallery and filling it , they didn&#39;t stop taking their independence, US gov still tanging on them but they are finding alternatives I guess Huawei is the toughest tech giant company I&#39;ve ever seen and maybe in near future they&#39;ll make it, it still hard to run globally as Google but they are making their pathway and their devices wow are the toughest ones in the market , now I&#39;m thinking on getting the Pixel 7 pro maybe one day I&#39;ll get back when the Harmony Os reaches the global sufficiency
Huawei only need to put back google in their phone😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZGpmWrVSaU&amp;t=409">6:49</a> btw these companies wanna make profit, they will add these apps on to new alternate appstores, if google services got ban on those countries, people have trust issues over US tech giants if u know what i mean💀
Everything related to Chinese technology is a national security concern to America and the West. We know that Chinese tech companies and the Chinese government work along to spy American citizens and government.
And look how Harmony is warming up...
Comment section is a bunch of chinese bootlickers
24 24 24 24 24. I almost forgot about Mr. 24. He is a warrior. The best warrior in the universe.
Do you know what Hoors are Mr Brownlee? Theyre the prettiest girls in the whole universe. May Allah bless you with many. Ameen. Im jealous but I cant do anything because you are a good guy. Go go Mr Brownlee. Yippieeee.
I think you missed something there. Hauwei is still going to use all the American parts. They just aren’t going to pay Americans for it anymore. All those American companies have their parts made in China. The Chinese don’t have any laws against use of your products without your permission. They’ll get a custom version of Linux os that isn’t Android. That’s it<br><br>If you honestly think Americans have any impact on a major Chinese company... well, you’re a fool
I see you are still promoting this company while the CCP burns down our constitution. All for clicks and money.
I have been using Huawei (mate and p30 pro) since 2019 and it is the best phone I have ever had, by far. I&#39;ve had 2 Huawei phones since 2019 and both are still in amazing condition, as if brand new, and I put 80-90 hours on it a week. I bought both before the ban, so I have full access to Google and everything else still.<br><br>Also, I was neighbors to the CFO (Meng Wazhou) when she was placed on house arrest in Vancouver Canada. We had undercover agents surrounding the entire neighborhood. They would take pictures of us whenever we drove by. Crazy!
This isn’t good for consumers the west is China’s biggest enemy they are stranglehold on our economy is frightening due to the increase in Chinese import it has cut our labor and capital value in half
We are so screwed
I feel like I’ve seen you before… like on some YouTube frame video a long time ago on a guest account or something. You’ve been like living on the back of my head rent free.
I use everything from huawei
The problem is that all phones spy on you we all know this and there is no stop to this and I think it is completely stereotypical and stereotype centered because it is a Chinese brand
Get A VPN move your location to Europe like I DO, still running my MATE 20 PRO yes the 20 PRO in 2022 still get 2 about 2 days from my battery, getting all my updates via switching location to europe .... running the latest EMUI which is wayyy better then IOS imo, my wife still using her P30 pro and our daughter using an Honor devise for her first phone...... but this is due to Apple going to Trump getting huawei banned right after huawei took the number 2 spot
3y later iPhone 14
My dad&#39;s close to 10 years old Huawei smartphone is still thriving hard, only very minimum black screen that happened to my old S6 scarcely year 2 into its life. Huawei would have smoked Samsung and Apple if it were let to run amok. No. Do not bring me that spying bs. Apple has been proven to be spying on everyone, if not Facebook etc already doing it.
Trump literally said: imma end this whole company career
Apple is behind the executive order for the market coverage strategy.
The huawei ban was simply pure jealousy, the united states are just bad losers.
I&#39;m watching on my Huawei mate 10 lite now 2022 their still launching phones I just love huawei forever 💕💕💕
Watching using my huawei nova 9
good job Trump, your ban is making Huawei more stronger and innovate them their own HarmonyOs
Huawei phones are just the goat fuck google fr
Who else is watching this video in 2022 after YouTube recommended it all of a sudden
How the hell is this company so big, but the vast majority of people haven&#39;t heard of them.
China dictates what can and cannot be sold in China, they have no copyright laws and steal all our patients. Our companies in the western world invest in the manpower, talent and infrastructure then they come along and copy it for free.
Watching from my Honor device, I love it 🙂
It’s pretty simple. They were using their tech to spy on other countries and individuals and got banned
The govt still spy on you anyway
Not a complicated issue at all. There is not a single technical paper that shows how Huawei is spying or poses as security threat to US or to any country. The real reason why Huawei is banned is they could take away market share from US tech giants in 5G, Internet server etc due to their significant cost advantage + R&amp;D advantage . This is just clear as day and night.
In Canada,Huawei also ban because of US Sanction
Me sitting here with the huwawi p40 pro
I just got a huawei device just because it&#39;s the best priced mid range device I could see, They got a psuedo-google access but it&#39;s not good enough, I still need to do some 3rd-party shenanigans just to be able to play wild rift. And I can&#39;t even buy premium currency coz I got no google service
Huawei still stands their ground
That&#39;s  why huawei should need to ban because  Huawei make andriod failed to work ,spread malware . Samsung working well because not huawei as huawei touch main andriod linux kernel .
Doesn&#39;t apple and Google do the same shit with there products
and customers are suffering from this political fight!
lo
All a way to control the market. Cheaper phones with more quality this is why they banned them.
only apple for winning the market 🥲
bro i clicked on this and a honey ad of you in it popped up lol
Fact check!! Google not bound by Trump executive orders! They proactively complied to stay in &quot;good grace&quot; with the Trump supporters. An Executive Order by the President is not legislation. Instead, its purpose is to enforce laws passed by Congress. Executive Orders only apply to government employees. Executive Orders cannot subject private citizens to specific restrictions and rules. They cannot be used to pass a budget or abolish an act of Congress. Trump not only corrupt but an stern racist (per Michael Cohen). Trampling on citizen&#39;s right has become the &quot;New Norm&quot; Truth Seeker Unite
Whatever the ban can be....<br><br>But noother giants can beat Huawei technology......<br>Huawei could have rocked the world with new innovations...<br><br><br>We lost it...
Trump is a prick man he lies in everything bans things he dont even own u no! Had nuffin to do wiv him
Huawei just got banned in Canada recently as well!
Not having to update my phone sounds every second sounds like a good idea to me. I don&#39;t need &#39;security updates&#39; everyday until I have no storage space left...
Seeing the phones they are making, it&#39;s bullshit. The big dogs were afraid. There was a time 7 out of 10 persons had a Huawei
I would do the same thing if some other company raise up so fast , this is all bullshit you think Apple and Samsung would let some other company raise up so fast ,,,shit
Huawei 2022:<br>HarmonyOS isn&#39;t android and it&#39;s our own OS with our own Services<br>Me who has Huawei phone:<br><b>installs android apks</b>
Huawei was blackballed by other companies. Marques doesn&#39;t mention this because well... what good what that do for him if he&#39;s denied access to say Apple. Soon as China makes a product good enough to compete and essentially make US companies lose billions, they block them. Pure corrupt politics. I just hope this doesn&#39;t happen to NIO
Idk, I feel like the real reason of this ban is because American sector couldn‘t keep up/compete with huawei. Like other companies also spy on us, it is not new it is disingenuous that only huawei is banned.
Nice hair style
Fk Google and it&#39;s services. Google proved through time that it&#39;s not reliable. I will keep buying Huawei products because they are the best and I will skip the stupid Google services finding new alternative. Again fk Google 👎
Good job explaining the issue, and while you focused on ways Huawei could work around the ban, you said nothing about whether there was any substance behind the reason for the ban. Do Huawei products spy for the CCP?
They could always do a Linux
You didn&#39;t really talk about WHY the ban!
Good fuck china we need to put the USA before a phone
Yea this was really stupid to do , why would you stop the competition with the tech company’s? They was putting the pressure on each other and was creating wonderful things. The folding phone was about to make things turn up in a great way for tech. Capitalism is a problem, and the tech community should have came together and boycotted all the remaining companies, the people have power enable your power. Then again maybe we need other options besides google and android. Why not, why doesn’t it exist already?? Got me thinking , to the real smart coders , you’re palms should be getting moist.
Few years later Harmony os dropped 😂😂😂
Google spys on you as well ... There it&#39;s not privacy while using a phone...
Huawei smartwatch are awesome and cheaper ...
Every company spy&#39;s on you iPhone Samsung Facebook .. they only banned it cuz they don&#39;t like competition Huawei products are as good as Samsung.....
Bruh trump is worried about them spying on us?? 😂😂😂plsss everything basically is, and yes including google
<b>L.</b><br><br><br><b>just a big L.</b>
American created apps and browsers are banned in America. Who gives shit if they let go of Huawei? 😂
usa has always being a bully, they are trash.
I would like to see a update on this topic, there happend a lot in my opinion.
GL
I cant understand us gov added huawei but didnt add honor
Waawai
One percent of Huawei is owned by the company’s founder and chief executive, Ren Zhengfei, which makes him a very rich man. But the other 99 percent is owned equally by all 180,000 workers through their union.<br><br>What U.S. company allows its workers to own 99 percent of the business — especially a business that is growing and thriving?<br><br>It seems very likely that this position of the workers at Huawei is what accounts for its remarkable achievements, as well as for the great hostility of the U.S. ruling class toward the company.
We have smart TV these days.
Obama created 59.5 million refugees that overtook Europe.  Trump hurt our cell phone infrastructure by banning Huawei.  NATO is doing all they can to start WWIII with Russia.  Gotta love America the country that spreads competition, democracy and freedumb.
3 years later and still no Huawei phones. I think this is permanent.
Holy $hit what did Huawei do? What kinda big f** up is that
Big nose hah hah ah ha ha ha
Google running long time ago,it take lot time to get here,china just request help from google.without the google services it become trash,now china get kick out from house,huawei need many years to make complete house like google😆🤣
waway
I have huawei 😀
What happens when I get rid of Huawei?
So pity.. i love all huawei phones  and their design.
I can Rader stay with Huawei f3the rest of my life even know there&#39;s no Google service like I just bought the nova8i that just came out on the market
Motorola is owned by Lenovo which is a Chinese company yet the vast majority if not all US Police Departments use Motorola for their radio communications does anyone see the irony in this?
Huawei need a second ban lmao the honor phone is literally huawei with different name
Now we need a Xiaomi ban
when all your phones have been huawei
Welp, American government playing politics to hurt a company abroad that is about to surpass them? not the first time, youtube Alstom, a company from France which was leading in energy and now blackmailed and crippled by America. Or have you hear Plaza Accord, where they crippled Japan&#39;s economy in 1980s when they were about to surpass them?
Welcome to golgumbaz 2021
Americans American government talk about boycott Huawei ,Huawei 5G and others way before the BS Meng Wanzhou case about National Security Risk , National Security Threats.
American Government lies fake news CBS 48 Hours and many hacking false claims of spying lies about National Security , Risk National security Threats still lying about spying.
Huawei never spying on Americans or any other countries or murder of Americans Engineer in 2012.
Did you see the movie about this company??? This company is basically a spy machine for the ccp! Don&#39;t like Trump but I can see why he did it
Portuguese me holding my huawei... Banning facebook out of my life (not really, cos mark Zuckers bought instagram and whatsapp. 🤢) <br>Huawei Services and phones... Let you download an Android Rom and still use the same ish!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZGpmWrVSaU&amp;t=244">04:04</a> ~~
Forget Huawei is great and forever be.The company just gives you their all in one that&#39;s amazing. They should male their own os etc we will still buy.
Also doesn&#39;t China also assemble iPhones?why aren&#39;t they scared of that?😂
It’s pronounced ‘Huawei’, not ‘Wawei’..
This sucks
Huawei is the biggest but now vivo and redmi and OPPO and others are winning but my device is the huawei mediapad m5 lite pro that is space black and it has Google but every update goes to more to be huawei which is not good for installating apps😔😢😞😭 and honor is a separate brand but it is the same but they are trying to trick the banners they are not using huawei and mixing with others 🙂
Oct 2021 Update (its a important news): Honor has separated themselves from Huawei and with that, Google Services returned to Honor Phones.
Trump: Stop evading other Asian teritories.<br>China: Who U!<br>Trump: Ban Huawei!<br>$tupid American: Kick him out!<br><br>China: Lets spread a virus so that the world does not know what we do in the pacific and they might blame triump.<br>WHO: Ok!
Lol i just use vpn to switch server
Probably why US hasn&#39;t reversed the ban is because of the pandemic...
But you didn&#39;t explained why was it banned in first place....
huwawei just lost alot of sales and progress.  im happy
ive had a therory that that samsung could do somethibg if android gets discontinued; they could make ONE UI into an operating system
hate that big a** apple logo...don wanna see it ever
It been 2 years now could you please make an update
Huawai was (is) spying on us?<br><br>Anyone remembers Edward Snowdon? Echelon? Big hyprocritical Americans... -.-<br><br>This was and is just a way to stop and destroy Huawei as a company.
If you can&#39;t beat them, ban them
No ban anymore isn’t?
Bad president plus good company = oof
I’m not putting a dime of my money in the CCP’s pocket.
Google and Facebook have been banned in China for almost 10 years now. Why should Chinese companies get benefits they don&#39;t give American companies? You&#39;re suddenly mad America is doing what China has been doing for years?
the windows issue isnt really an issue, just don&#39;t include windows, load it with linux.
not complicated.<br><br>explanation:  capitalism.
Whether anyone likes it or not, one has to admit that Chinese tech companies being in the mobile device market has made feature phones extremely affordable to anyone and everyone. When the Chinese levelled up their tech game, the entire world felt that, particularly Apple and Samsung who then decided to put flagship features into budget phones. So I&#39;m grateful to Huawei and the rest of the Chinese tech manufacturers for doing that, if it weren&#39;t for them I&#39;d never be enjoying the rich online content like I am doing now. Moving from Samsung to Xiaomi was the best decision ever for me.
What about other Chinese tech ones like Xiaomi and Oppo?
All the Chinese companies are belongs to corrupt communist governors FREE HONGKONG TIBET Muslims in China Remember Tiananmen Myanmar
No Google No android no 5G. that&#39;s will happen to those Companies are just emulating only and after that now a Spy
Everyone in the comment section:<br>&quot;US bad china good they&#39;re ending competition by banning others&quot;<br><br>How Ironic 😐
And here I am watching this vid with a Huawei P9
That&#39;s bull.... 😄
Watching this from the huawei nova 8
They steal all their tech from the U.S. and Canada. This is a fact.
SO THATS WHY I CANT LOG IN AT MY SCHOOL ACC Huh?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZGpmWrVSaU&amp;t=496">8:16</a> lol, LG.
Huawei’ App Store is like trash lol I’ve tried using it b4 and I hated that 😂
Summary: Huawei surpassed Apple in mobile phone sales globally. The US got scared and started banning Huawei on the guise of &#39;China is spying on us with Huawei phones&#39;. Google, Apple, Facebook and the American government have already been doing that for decades now but they are just scared that Huawei will own global communication services by the end of the decade and be the next superpower and bring The US down.
2 years later, and its blatantly obvious Corporate run US cant handle organised competition on the free market of global consumerism. So they have organised mass propaganda against china, and its companies, to slow down their massive growth. To give the slow private slaver capitalism a chance to catch up and compete against organised might of a working government that weaponised same capitalism against them. <br><br>Its never been about safety or security, everyone spies on everyone all the time. Post cold war that USSR collapsed at, the world didnt stop being the world and start being hollywood ffs.
I have been using phones since 2001. From the good old Nokia 3310, Ericsson, Sony, Sony Ericsson, Alcatel, Samsung etc. I bought my Huawei P10 Plus 4 years ago and to this day it runs like the 1st day I bought it. The best phone I ever had period. It&#39;s a damn shame this US vs China Brawl happened. Am gonna go full retard and say that US (google) shit their pants when they saw Huawei&#39;s potential and smacked them down.
Apple loses market share, Trump bans the biggest competitor , and they say it&#39;s free market...
I don&#39;t see how this kind of behaviour is different from what is done in North Korea or in western China, or when my bank ask me not to deal with Irak or close my business account. This is just ridiculous, just do atomic war and finish this. If we as a civilisation can not make it right, then self destruct, it&#39;s well deserved. And it is so so stupid when I read on facebook someone that does not want to be tracked ... ON FACEBOOK !! duuuude !!!
MARKASS BROWNLEE
It already stopped<br><br>Huawei user😭😭😭
My Huawei Matepad 10.4 didnt have play store and Google Meet doesn&#39;t work.
Ok fine I will say it, video is alright but that custom MacBook is subpar gents 😭😭 We all were thinking it.
Huawei = Yahweh
you don&#39;t know anything this company is ccp china communist party if it is it&#39;s top 1 tech company huawei will control the world n your info with 5g smarty
What this video tells me is that Google like kinda illegal??? It&#39;s probably not the textbook definition of a Monopoly buuuuttttt its pretty freakin close
I rather be monitored by China &quot; Huawei &quot;, instead of the Middle East Genocide bringer USA &quot; Google Phone and Iphone &quot;
If anyone can beat the bull shit of American lies that&#39;s Huawei. Soon Trump would be very sorry he banned Huawei. Huawei is not a small company like ZTE.
Watching on my Huawei p30??
I’m still upset by this
Guess what...the whole Country is putting all the strength to chips, now they can build the 14nm by theyself, and made a 65nm machine, guess 5 yrs after U.S. will regret this.
american capitalists couldn&#39;t compete so they cheated, like they always do
sooooo, this is why pokemon go stopped working on my huawei phone...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZGpmWrVSaU&amp;t=480">8:00</a> I recently got a Huawei laptop running windows, how did they overcome this issue?
I will explain very simple, google cannot effetely spying on us if there its other service spying, its only explanation that its valid<br>i myself got Huawei phone, and if i&#39;m being honest so far i like that don&#39;t have google services, its important that i can call and text, and use camera and mp3, Also they don&#39;t need own phone to spy they can probably hack anything in the first place
Something that will be damaging to Huawei is that they won&#39;t have YouTube or Netflix or even Amazon prime not even Disney + I don&#39;t know how they are going to solve those problems.
I just dont like huawei having the entire Chinese government paying them every single thing. Its kind of cheating also i like apple being number 1.
Huawei can’t use YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, google search ?? Sorry I’m from Central America so I don’t understand many things
Huawei phones are so good but I can&#39;t live without Google
Me watching  on my p20 pro
Huawei won&#39;t  need the US business in the future.  The Belt and Road Imitative will take care of this.
it seems as an opportunity to  me
they are  geting  emu
The comments so far are all about Trump. Now that Biden is Presixent, what is the current state of the ban ?
Seems like Apple paid someone lots of money to make this happen.
Market leaders in 5G: Ericcson (Swedish), Nokia (Finnish) and Huawei (Chinese). None of market leaders are from the US, so US gets a bit jealous and decide to ban Huawei to make the impression that the US has some authority in 5G technology. lmao
It leans to the right
A lot of people are talking about how Google and Facebook spies way more on people than Huawei does and how it’s ironic that Chinese Huawei is the one getting banned. The thing is, this is not about the privacy of the public. This is actually about a rivaling global superpower having the capacity to gain access to USA’s state secrets. It’s nowhere as near as major as a company selling your search data so that ads can be more directly targeted at you.
I am just surprised the Chinese never worked to compete with Youtube, Gmail, Facebook messenger, Whatsapp, Instagram and twitter -  WORLDWIDE !
I use a hauwai phone and I still have google and all that so idk what ur talking about
Jayconectz on Instagram is amazing 💯💯...
Jayconectz on Instagram is amazing 💯💯...
As a Chinese seeing Huawei Banned for 2 years now: What a great move!<br>Guys, I know you guys don&#39;t like your former President Trump, but banning Huawei is a absolutely brilliant decision.
Huawei is actually a very good phone with great camera functions.  I switched from an iPhone6+ to a HW Pro 30 and the photo-results have been phenomenal.  (I could take pictures of the moon!) <br>I was an Apple fan, die-hard, despised all the imitations.  but they have since surpassed the functionalities and innovations and this ban is unfortunate.  Reduces competition, innovation and consumer choices.
😂🤣 why this in my recommendation,nahhh eveyone know ,when western going to loose ,whey will cheat,then they call themself a champion,what a shame
But in Sweden huewai it is banned
Google :sweating profusely
because fuck china
I m here after HarmonyOS being presented
People here who think Huawei is just this innocuous company really are quite ignorant of how closely related it is to the Chinese government. It’s a tech fronts for the communist military period. Only a military company can manage to get a competing cell phone maker to fire their PR employee for pointing out huawei’s product is theft.
Hua Wei is backed by Chinese govt at all cost to drive out competitors and to dominate the market. You may think it’s good for consumer for the short term but for the long term , it’s a Faustian deal.
Great I have some problems understanding this Huawei phone I have
When I see Huawei getting unbanned now in 2021, all I think is that they did it just to stop a chinesse company&#39;s market share in the US... maybe I&#39;m wrong but that&#39;s what I feel. In the end, it&#39;s easier to compare statistics rather than knowing if they were spying or not 😅
Now I xnat play any of my games since apkpure doesn&#39;t update 😭😭😭😭
Here, After one year later......
The shut patient surely polish because burma neurologically skip alongside a soggy garlic. handsomely, dramatic delivery
The hypnotic middle topologically supply because toad aboaly hate amongst a billowy mask. obscene, capricious iran
The illustrious step-sister additionly fill because twist formerly rub between a earsplitting accountant. unbiased, disgusting receipt
Due to the horrendous US abuses against Huawei &amp; China, I for one from now on will buy China/Russia products whenever possible. China has become the most powerful nation fair and square and for that, the US is showing itself as a sore loser. We need competition and Huawei is a fantastic company as to is DJI &amp; Zhiyun Crane-Tech these companies make much better products than their American counterparts and for that, they are punished which is a travesty.<br>The US answer for everything they can not control, buy out, silence is to discredit or destroy, its sad but true and history will show that this is yet another dark stain on their history.<br><br>The real spies are not the Russians or the Chinese but the &#39;5 Eyes&#39;
Why Blacks don&#39;t make Holiday in Africa?
Wieso machen schwarze kein Urlaub in Afrika?
China: Prohibits most Western companies from participating in their market.<br><br>US: Bans Huawei<br><br>China: surprised Pikachu face
I&#39;m worried about Xiaomi.. 🥺
Matepad battery is actually insane.
FYI, all the APPs you mentioned in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZGpmWrVSaU&amp;t=407">6:47</a> are banned in China, so no worry for Huawei
The problem we don&#39;t see here is how this US companies have monopoly over the world. You can&#39;t use a computer without Microsoft, Apple . You can&#39;t use a phone without Android, Apple.  Also the most popular apps are also from USA.
If you can&#39;t beat them ban them.
Great video quality as always.  I watched it all the way through but didn’t learn why Huawei was banned.  Just that it was banned and that sucks.   Your title is a bit misleading.
He is telling the truth
Why Samsung has less than %1 marketshare in China? While the same company got %30 marketshare in US. Oppo and Xiaomi also got around %8 in US market. In Chinese market only Apple got %16 that is it. No other foreign brand including world leader Samsung got a share in China even though Chinese smartphone market triple the size of US market. Why is that? Is this fair? They are restricting Korean tech companies for a long time. Nobody is talking about it. Noone can explain why Samsung (world leader brand) doesn&#39;t have a significant share in the world&#39;s largest smartphone market. Why nobody don&#39;t critisize this unfair situation about China??
Huawei has great cameras<br>Too bad they&#39;re still banned from using Google
U lie bro I upgraded from android 9 pie to android 10 on Huawei Mate 20 Pro
This just shows hos US corpo has way too much power over international companies..
USA: oh no we are AFRAID of competition of a rising superpower<br>USA: We’re banning Huawei because I guess they’re spying on us<br>Huawei: Bruh you annoying piece of *(&amp;)(*&amp;(*&amp;^&amp;^%$%^$###^&amp;*&amp;##$%^&amp;*(&amp;(_(*(&amp;^%$#@#$%^&amp;*()_)*&amp;^%$<br><br>Other countries: I guess we’ll also start banning Huawei
Ironically there&#39;s more evidence Google is spying on people than Huawei. The spying clearly isn&#39;t the issue, it&#39;s who&#39;s doing the spying
Are they still banned
F! Communist Governments.
One of the reasons behind the US ban of Huawei ban is to to try and illegally help Apple regain its 2nd place position in the world mobile phone market which was taken by Huawei until recently. There is another and more important reason however. And that is to stop Huawei&#39;s dominance in the 5G equipment sector which is years in advance of the US with Huawei actually possessing 95% of 5G equipment technology patents. That was the reason why the US embarked on a  5G technology theft from Huawei by illegally ordering its dominion, Canada to arrest Huawei CEO Weng Wanzhou while on transit to Argentina to launch its 5G network in that country on fabricated accusation of breaching the illegal US unilateral sanctions against Iran and steal her laptop and storage devices containing Huawei 5G technology secrets and send them over to the US in 2018. Since them the US has rebranded Huawei&#39;s stolen 5G equipment technology and forced it dominions to ditch the original Huawei system replacing it with the US copy of the original Huawei 5G technology.
Watching this in Apr&#39;2021,i am wondering how did Huawei managed to solve these issues? Wud love to see ur thots on this as an update to the storyline..
Even though Huawei had to jump through hoops of flame , sharks with lesser and spikes they gonna come out of this okay
The Huawei ban is one of the dumbest things Trump did.  Since the Chicago Apple store did not give me my Macbook pro back before I came back to Italy I bought a Huawei Matebook pro.  I also got the Matepad pro, and love their phones.  Maybe Trump&#39;s protectionism was the reason I got a great deal on the phone and computer.  BTW your videos are great and very informative.  At this point my phone updates and it seems the only one that does not have Google native is the Mate Pad Pro, though you can work around it.
they ban them cause samsung and apple cant compete
Thanks America! We all know why Huawei got banned. And it had nothing to do with spying...<br>Like so many times before: If you don&#39;t have any reasons, make up some and repeatedly insist they are true until people will believe you. Making your own reality apart from reality...

Can&#39;t Google or the other US companies work with Huawei through a Google company based in another country? Aren&#39;t those separate entities?
The berserk cuticle trivially wave because carnation enzymatically frame for a petite peripheral. scarce, needless earthquake
Half the software/hardware that Huawei buys from American tech companies, they produce themselves. So Huawei is only getting to expand more without American tech assistance. Watch Ren Zhengfei&#39;s interview with the BBC. He&#39;ll explain it to you.
Bans are good. Fuck communists.
Ahh the good ole American mentality of Its bad when you do it but not when do it
Android is open source -- they can use Android, they just can&#39;t get the nice custom builds Google usually gives manufacturers, and can&#39;t use Google Play etc.
Huawei is banned because it have best technology available than anybody else in usa,same thing what edison did to nikola , saying his dc current  electricity could kill people and animals.
so if the orders reverse..... how will the present devices get android or google services back?
I wish I had seen this before buying my Huawei.....it sooooo freaking useless....the worst part is no one is ready to buy it even at 25% of the price .....if any own has any solution to ds plzzzz comment down
All the anti-China racism has led to the recent attack on asians.
Don&#39;t worry Marques Brownlee,  America will bow to China.
Hahaha that banning was just a dark moved our government did as usual, no one soy more than our American companies
Trouble with Huawei is they we tied to the hip with the CCP. Which means you couldn&#39;t trust them further than you could drag a soggy mattress up a spiral staircase.
Not a totally bad thing to China,it is an alarming to every Chinese company that they need to plan for US&#39;s sanctions for no reasons anytime, and what they ban, we will make it ourselves.
Trump:<br><br><br><br><br><br>2024! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸SAVE AMERICA🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
My next phone, hopefully
You are making better than us? We ban you !
Thanks usa for banning Huawei and others Chinese companies. Now they are building more and more and getting stronger.
Please review Huawei Mate x2. I am a citizen of Bangladesh I watch all your videos. I hope I have never commented before reviewing this is the first time. Thanks
explained? i thought explanation would be to explain WHY al this happened, not chatting about consiquences
Some rich Chinese dude should buy Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and Google, lol.
Even godzilla cant survive with its head cut off. Trump did it because America is well behind on 5 g technology and by banning America can secure market share on 5 g  by buying themselves time.
Samsung: stonks
my next phone is a huawei
Who would want to do business with a company complicit in genocide.
Hi!<br>Do you think Biden will be able to restore the business between China and the US, so Huawei will have Google Services back?<br>Love from The Netherlands!
So people should be afraid of Huawei, while my facebook account all the sudden shows adds for things i&#39;ve SPOKEN about, but never searched for.<br>Yea... It is Huawei that does the spying.
If huawei and ccp secret relationship can be cut off, huawei is welcomed.

Soooo why didn&#39;t China ban Apple?
Everytime a Chinese company is growing bigger the USA would fuck it up, Huawei, Wechat, DJI, Tiktok... And then they would criticize China for not being a free market or whatever. Who’s next? Tencent or NIO
Huawei is a very successful company. The west.. Esp USA and UK just cannot fathom their success... So what they do... Ban it... Shame on these countries... Huawei will succeed in spite of these bans. They are the leaders in these technologies... They will get stronger and stronger.. And all those other companies who have been given the the licences to operate in these countries still rely on huawei... Go huawei... And keep going
Do anyone notice that when a phone start coming up and competing with the Apple phone they get throwed out of the United States of America it is something wrong there. there should be in competition against apple apple is getting rid of everyone that is their competition to keep us buying high phones with bad batteries this is not the way America should be doing business. This is becoming a communist move where we can only use Apple products in America because everything else is going to be Chinese and we&#39;re not going to be allowed to use it.
Ugh can&#39;t the new president undo that executive order? They have some pretty cool looking phones.

How about if Huawei Mate 10 or Mate 20 considering it is made before the ban?
Huawei Is A Flagship Killer Smartphone 🙂🙂
Being cut from google is fine I reckon, it&#39;s being cut from buying/selling with ANY US company that is a pretty big blow. In the end I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine now, a growing Chinese and 3rd world market is all you need, me thinks. Especially if the 1st world market is close to shrinking. Hopefully that will mean that there will be less reliance on intellectual property BS and they can finally make linux laptops instead.
Can u download apk files?
I can’t exactly put my finger on it but this video just feels super weird to me. There’s a lot more to this that wasn’t spoken about and China was barely mentioned throughout the video
It&#39;s not about security its about being dominate and helping big corp like Apple and qualcomm to have the upper hand.
It&#39;s all a power move for $$$$ they dont give a flying fart in space about our information security. Huawei was making waves, dominating the 5g market and disturbing companies like Apple and Samsung with their prowess (Huawei was already selling more than Apple and was about to beat out Samsung as well). <br><br>If you can&#39;t beat em, ban em!
My new iPad has Huawei app store  but for the app Google docs and Google Chrome app I need use another app to install... Is working here in Portugal, I have all my online work in Google docs...
Good??? For us? Nah!!!!!
How to UN ban Huawei?<br>Apple should ban trump🤣🤣
I think it&#39;s worth to mention that in China people don&#39;t use Google Play Store at all.
Huawei has officially proven  to spy, and hack. As of today every single bit of evidence has come out, about the election being rigged, Huawei was a part of it, as well as other foreign countries from outside the US. Most rigged/ changed hit in specific areas, but just about every state had some form of vote fraud going on from foreign countries. Over 66% of those were coming from China. And a matter of fact is tied to Huawei. <br><br>This hits different.
they might make a windows phone or they might use an apple ios perhaps
Right now some Huawei users are doing bypass to add google playservices. HAHAHA. They doing a lists of process to add Google Services and other apps
We want Waah-Way to die, cuz were,  &#39;Merican!!!

Trump: BAN HUAWEI IN US AND CANNOT ALLOW TO PARTNER WITH GOOGLE!<br><br>Google: why? We want to partner with Huawei?<br><br>Trump: BECAUSE THEY&#39;RE SPYING ON US!!<br><br>Google: <b>gulp</b> o-okay....<br><br>Huawei: but you&#39;ve been banning China products from the past years.<br><br>Also Huawei: alright if you wanna fight. We&#39;re gonna fight <b>builds Huawei AppGallery</b><br><b>builds its own Chip set</b> <b>builds its own assistant and more</b> there. HarmonyOS i know its isn&#39;t much for Huawei users but there we work hard to this. We will still upgrade.<br><br><br>Me: i want to wait to buy Huawei phones without Google so its all upgraded i don&#39;t want apk websites what if there are viruses so i just need to wait patiently.
This was just for market share zero to do with “spying” lol the US spies constantly I just had all my accounts hacked by the FBI. It’s hilarious how people say oh east Germany had a stasi when west Germany had a stasi too and conintelrpo killed people and spied on people. “Free speech” lol lolololol
That&#39;s not like China hasn&#39;t been American companies from doing business in china. If I remember correctly Facebook and Google do not exist in China for very obvious reasons.

That’s why Xiaomi is much better then Huawei....
Yes,,, until China&#39;s Huawei is as moral, ethical, and straight up as the USA the largest Domestic and International Spy Nation in the World well then we,,, just can&#39;t ethically do business with them... I mean look at the honesty of Apple iOS and Google Android back door heaven? We can invade people&#39;s electronics and have back doors in our cell phones but not China&#39;s Huawei...

I don&#39;t know about US, but in my country Huawei phones are very popular. Mostly because they are very good for the price. Even the low-end ones. Very nice design, built quality, well optimized OS and reliability is there. That&#39;s everything that most people expect from a phone. I had cheap Y6II Compact for like 5 years and it worked great until it finaly suffered from charging issues and died. Now I got 4 years old used Y6II (bigger one) in mint condition and it&#39;s great. I don&#39;t need a better phone, with great camera and fancy features, high resolution display, latest Android etc. Just want it to be reliable and responsive.
Huawei kinda sucks now. I can&#39;t used important apps bec of this ban, will be moving to other brand next upgrade
Have things changed because I have a huawei p30 pro I&#39;m in AUS I&#39;m getting updates
CHINA
Right now china is on the hot seat, as they should be. They have done and said a lot of shit that will sadly not be answered for. Stuff like this is worth celebrating to show that we remembered the evil things that the country has done. And some fancy consumer goods will not be enough for us to forget

If they&#39;re worried about spying, just make laws against it that all manufacturers have to comply with. Though, it would have to include U.S. companies too if the government doesn&#39;t want their spying operations to be obvious.

I&#39;m using huawei coz I like it better than iPhone and Samsung. I still have Google play though, still annoying how USA are greedy and jealous. I don&#39;t like Apple and would never support it, I better buy Samsung or Xiaomi. I&#39;ll still use my phone until it broke. I hope China make a better Appstore.

USA talking about spying😂 When they spy all over the world.
Can you do one on HarmonyOS?  Their answer to Android.  Thoughts?
Now the dumb yellow-haired man is history there&#39;s a chance things calm down here.
They are already cut off from Google, even from an apple device, YouTube and google don’t seam to work in China
MKBHD, your right, the Android huawei have right now isn’t ideal, with out google, YouTube, gmail... oh wait, Chinese people don’t use them anyways, they have their Chinese alternatives within the firewall😅

Why baning its one of best phones samsung fedup with iohone and there Huawei always loyal to its costomer... We cant even find google... So google will be proud of  joining huawei and much more
Trump is just😤😤, but Joe Biden is now finally president thank god🙏😢👍
Another bad decision of your president ... thank god is leaving a place he never deserves ...
We all know that the US just use the spy part as excuse! US just doensnt like when non US products are doing it better then US products. thye did this same shit towards the german car industy to make sure germans dont sell more cars in the US then US own made cars.
Please update this because I isn&#39;t know how it is today ?

Huawei&#39;s products are insanely good. This ban sucks!
Okay, so your video is well over a year and a half on YouTube. I just got myself the Huawei P30 Lite New Edition 2020 and all &quot;platforms&quot; are fully operational and updated. I&#39;m running on Android Version 10.1 and very soon, the device will update itself to Version 11.
U.S. : We not will let Huawei spy on our citizens, only we get to do that

Waw
I&#39;m so angry that google have to bend down by a racist president in the WHITE HOUSE. its 2020 with covid and i&#39;m lashing out now bcs it start to effect me. I had a huawei phone that lasted WAyyy longer than any other phone (especially samsung that only last for two years maximum before it goes koo-koo). I&#39;m so disappointed that and do you think this situation is just on a baseless allegation that the white house come up with, which later they back track and oh, its bcs of the 5g, than oh, its bcs the founder was an ex military personal for china...... who don&#39;t serve your country? oh wait yeah, the trumps. So if huawei is a spy, than what about snowden revealation? I&#39;m gonna say it and say it again...... cos snowden overnight became a terrorist but the cia who illegally spy on the world, gets nothing. Simply announce oh they shut down the programmed which i don&#39;t&#39; believe so. I do have a feeling this have something to do with the big corporation. Why? They all take turns taking the lead selling new phones, and than huawei comes in....... boomz, its perfecto. NOW i wish President Biden undo this mess and really just lift this stupid banned. Its not just us users are suffering but hey, how many american businesses too rely on huawei good reputation software to keep their business run smooth.... ay lot. sigh. Lets hope lets hope guys..... biden = change.
Wait till these people realise that almost everything they own at least has 1 Chinese made part
Oh yeah Google sure doesn&#39;t sell your information to CIA and NSA
Us: bans Huawei <br>China: bans apple <br>Samsung: lol XD
For me, it&#39;s either Samsung or Apple. But Apple is expensive so I bought a Samsung smartphone  J2 Pro with split-screen and full HD 2 years ago and it&#39;s still working
waiting for cheuk sing ban
Is this good news for Huawei ban = Biden in
Apple was trying to make a good 3d scan like years or months and then Samsung users: Apple sucks <br>Also Samsung: <b>ima copy this</b> <br>Samsung users: APPLE STOP COPYING US! <br>Literally Samsung users are useless and they always wrong!<br>Apple was being creative unlike Samsung! My favourite company is Apple!
meanwhile apple: <b>sweating intensifies</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZGpmWrVSaU&amp;t=597">9:57</a> That ZTE phone looks like if Trump were a phone.
Other country: <b>industry starts doing threateningly well</b><br>The US: What they&#39;re not allowed to do that. Welp, TIME FOR TRADE WAR.<br><br>Honestly. Just accept that that&#39;s the natural progression of the world and stop rigging the game for God&#39;s sake.
Me: whispering to my wife 5g is banned.<br>Wife: why are you whispering??<br>Me: I don&#39;t want Mark Zuckerberg to hear me.<br>We all laugh. And soon enough Siri laughs, Alexa laughs
5g was also banned cause it is harmful at a cellular level in the human body and harmful to the environment. Look up the particle physicist who talks about this.
US: don&#39;t buy Huawei equipment!<br>citizen: Why?<br>US: Because they will spy on you<br>citizen: How do you know?<br>US: Because we  are spying on the Chinese government and you!
Trump: Huawei is spying on us.<br>Facebook: <b>Sweating</b> yeah they shouldn’t do that.<br>Google: heh...
politics sucks man i dont understand anything
A year from this, I still find it weird that they singled out Huawei right after they beat Apple in the market sales and consumer preference.
Hopefully this can be undone... just to make 2021 better.
Huawei has a big appetite, their firstly should make phone who can work more than 2 years without bugs.
Can kids hold these things and learn tech from &quot;unusuable&quot; phones? Because root folk like myself would be glad to have one if we could... or would it be such that we have to go there and physically pick up the device? Cause if so then never mind
apple s no 1 ass kisser
google, facebook should also be banned !!!
Even NOT BAN, as a consumer I WILL NOT USE any CHINA BRAND. I believed China Brand is just a RUBBISH. You will know after you used one of it... NO THANK YOU. Not ANYMORE.
Google spy me anyway 24/7 .... I weith to end Harmony OS and say bye bye google forever!
“You wont get anymore software updates”<br>Galaxy S9 users: “oh yeah nothing to worry about”
I realize this video is over a year old, but could you make an update discussing how all this has been playing out?  Thanks!
Google: why did you ban Huawei<br>Trump: because they&#39;re spying on us<br>Google: ( heavily sweating ) oh ok
Why did I buy this phone
huawei sold american equipment to iran
I&#39;m watching this on Huawei y3 2018
India, Taiwan, Hon Kong... the whole world, the new Nazis. Ban Huawei
they need 10 year to create almost same like google services
Well yeah, that&#39;s what we expected
Why did they ban only Huawei?<br>Not OnePlus Vivo Oppo or Xiaomi??
Ooohhh... Sooo basically, the US wants to be the only one that&#39;s able to spy.
Can this ban be removed by Joe Biden
The government :No more software, security updates<br>Every Huawei user:This is fine
China needs to change there attitude and start respecting peoples privacy
This sucks I really wanted to get a Huawei flagship 🤷‍♂️ oh well I guess
you can install app illegally lol if you really want there is a way.
Huawei: <b>*gets banned*</b><br>Xiaomi: <b>*screams in chinese*</b> <b>HELLO AMERICA!</b>
Well. just bought p30pro, gets updating from play market..
Why are YouTube ads longer now ?
I imagine these Hauwei restrictions only apply to the U.S.
The US will ban an innocent phone company and innocent kinder eggs but they wont ban guns
I live in UK i`m thinking of buying second hand Huawei P20. I`m not sure now.  :(
I would like to hear about how huawei was banned. I&#39;ve heard a lot about bad stuff they&#39;ve done.
it makes sense to avoid your fotos and geolocation information taken by foreign companies.
Dont let huawei spy you bro you have your rights and that what we called privacy.
Job well done usa👍👍..    ❤️
So, I bought Huawei Y9 pro this year and unboxed the phone myself. To my surprise, Google Play Store was working along with Huawei App Gallery. Also, up to date Android was also there as a OS. So, propaganda is fuxking dead -- bro.
This is just shocked me 👏👍Now i believe Huawei they developed far beyond. Huawei can do it. All countries should Not always rely on USA who always ban and stop anyone they want.
Starting to sound like Google has a unfair monopoly...
Peace!✌️<br>Yea peace indeed
Huawei  already working on 6g  , developing their own version of android and app market, mad respect.<br>What would have samsung done if there was no android, run windows 10??
USA talking about spying😂 When they spy all over the world.
Wait A sec if China already Ban Google, snapchat, Facebook, Instagram why do they make business with them
So blacky WHAT YOU SAYING NOW!
Huawei is controlled by the CCP. Ban it.
This has been MKBHD&#39;s way of talking about politics.
America spy&#39;s on allied countries hypocritical much
That explains why I&#39;m banned from twitter
WTF, Almost Chinese people are using iphones
I use Huawei Matepad, no GMS, no problem...
Welcome to the era of big government everybody, it is going to be fun ride!
Kindly do a video about HarmonyOS. Huawei&#39;s answer to Android.

Wow
My friend tried to buy a Huawei phone mail-order and it was confiscated by customs.... buyer beware
So the real story here is the stranglehold Google has, not only on the tech world, but the economies of countries in determining what can and can&#39;t get sold or who can make money or what information can be shared, and the sheer staggering amount of information they have on the world&#39;s population and businesses is truly glute-clenching. They are effectively every scary business entity owned by Ronnie Cox in 80s films.
DoD already used up a big part of the 5G MMW frequencies (spectrum allocation for 5G), leaving less commercial use.

Although DOD uses certain MMW frequencies for high-profile military applications such as Advanced Extremely High-Frequency satellites that provide assured global communications for U.S. forces, it extensively uses sub-6 frequencies—leaving less sub-6 availability in the United States than in other countries. The Defense Innovation Board (DIB) advised DOD to consider sharing sub-6 spectrum to facilitate the build-out of 5G networks and the development of 5G technologies used in the sub-6 band. While DOD has been moving toward greater spectrum sharing, it has expressed concern that sharing presents operational, interference, and security issues for DOD users. As an alternative to spectrum sharing, some analysts have argued that portions of the sub-6 spectrum should be reserved for commercial use. This would require DOD to relocate certain applications to other parts of the spectrum. The DIB estimates this approach would take around 10 years to complete, as opposed to 5 years for spectrum sharing.&quot;)
why iam still getting updates on my Huawei phone tho?
This could be a chance to have another competitor to Google and play store.....<br><br>This move from the US government could fire back on them .... by making other major companies like samsung .. questions there future with the US companies ..   they will feel they are not safe as well ..
When i grow up I wanna be you
Holy shit the way he pronounces huawei makes me want to kill myself
They should sell the company to america
I just got a new tablet <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>And its the Huawei Matepad T8
Ad skskkppe 0:1
please check your facts better most of the companies U mentioned are all Chinese owned/controlled
Google is technically an international company, not only a US company
Americans Engineer Shane Todd  fake death and Huawei in 2012 have to do with all the banned companies now  claimed of stealing technologies espionage The Todd’s families want justice a totally fake biased hateful ignorant racist story nothing but a lie on 48 hours crime shows been debunked many times. The Banned of Huawei trying to ban Tiktok Wechat claimed of stealing users information and give it to China Government it was totally false all lies to make money out of the books the Todd’s are liars and a Fraud like North Korean Defector Yeonmi Park all about money for their Books and fame.
Reminder - On December 1, 2018, while transferring planes at Vancouver International Airport en route to Mexico from Hong Kong, Meng Wanzhou (a Huawei excecutive and daughter of company founder) was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) at the request of the United States, pursuant to the extradition treaty between Canada and the United States. Meng has been under house arrest since. Huawei and Meng were charged with bank and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud in relation to skirting American sanctions on Iran. The same day, the U.S. government announced a different indictment against Huawei relating to theft of trade secrets; but that does not pertain to Meng personally.<br>As far back as 2003, the company was accused of stealing intellectual property, including from U.S.-based network hardware maker Cisco. The companies settled out of court, but Huawei has been accused of stealing other firms&#39; intellectual property and violating international economic sanctions.
Iv just picked up a p40 pro great phone with some work arounds I have 95% of the apps I use

I wondered what had happened to ZTE.

intel is not us comp since 8-9 ya, the good engineers from intel moved to amd and amd won back the market
If America is worried about &quot;security&quot; then they should talk about Facebook. They just mad cause huawei was beating the hell out of apple. Sour losers lol
Oh man I have been looking for that iWatch ban, where did you find it and how do I get it?
Keep in mind, in China, children work in production plants producing smartphones for Huawei. The Chinese government, the CCP, state that children under 16 aren’t allowed to work, but through an investigation back in 2014, it found more than half of the company’s employees were children under the age of 16. They work more than 13 hours a day for about 40 cents an hour. <br>So if you’ve bought a Huawei phone you’ve supported exploration of thousands upon thousands of children.
&quot;Sad version of the app store&quot; ~MKBHD 2019, Rekt Amazon with a couple of words.
Why you call it waway and not huawei?
They did it to keep Huawei from getting #1 (USA spies too, so complaining about spying is BS) ...its Apple and Samsung that keep pushing the prices up...ill continue Buying alternatives (Huawei) as long as they try to keep the prices lower
Google fackebook shud be banned by all countires...cos they do too much data stealing
One year down the line the headline says &quot;Huawei topples Samsung to become world&#39;s largest smartphone maker&quot;. As usual you are only shooting yourselves in the foot if you try to suppress competition illegally and not trying to improve yourselves. Lack of innovation and failure of US tech is more blatant than ever.
It is a trade ban between the US and china, so why shouldn&#39;t google offer its services to huawei outside of the US like for India, or any other than US???? Some please explain this.....@MKBHD pleas reply very eager to know....I am a google fan, i don&#39;t want harmony os to take up android&#39;s market share.
They might create a new game or app that might encourage non Chinese<br>Use hongmeng.
Huawei has even been banned from buying tech from other companies that use just use some US technology in their machines, which is just sick and much closer to entitlement and more like bullying than anything else
haha huawei don&#39;t play game with apple.     apple don&#39;t do like Huawei    no one going to buy.  this mobile for Huawei BOSS
So basically I need to get a new phone god fucking damnit
China : ban us companies<br>Us : ban china companies<br>China : wait, that&#39;s illegal
One of the reasons why I don&#39;t plan on buying Huawei, it&#39;s really cheap here in the Philippines when I first saw it, so I was really skeptical about it on why a phone like Huawei can be so cheap? And I found out that it&#39;s a Chinese company 👁️👄👁️
I don&#39;t support Trump and the ban but keep in mind that Huawei is not completely innocent
Open gapps: hello<br>Huawei not giving bootloader unlocking codes: nope
<b>1 year later</b> and <b>Huawei</b> is the <b>Number #1</b> manufacturer of <b>smartphones</b> in the <b>world!</b>
Who&#39;s here from 2020 and own a huawei phone, yeah i still have a juawei phone: huawei p20 lite. Haha
All lives matter.
USA like a bitch talking about honor
Everything will change whem Trump goes away this november!!
2 words Tik Tok
Today, who distrust Huawei from the CCP? You have the useful for pain of Chinese people. Do you want to be devils? You can choose.
Then what apple so expensive? Them tell apple make iPhone that everybody can afford!! I love US but this happened I don&#39;t like you anymore US much better US is time to time they will also banned here in Philippines 😂
Thanks Marques.....
I think bad idea to ban Huawie 🤔! In long term they will make a different system that means more companies that usa and eu has to fight for customers for . Banned Huawie will turn good for them . would be good for customers in the long term 5 year&#39;s from now
Nigaa tech
That&#39;s a big lie !! Why would Huawei want to spy on American ? Huawei even give their full source code to US and Europe country to examine. If Huawei is capable of spying then Apple iphone , Google , FB and etc is the biggest spy !!
short term pain but long term gain....this definitely help Huawei to grow
The new Huawei OS is called Harmony and the same OS is designed to work on everything from phones to laptops to refrigerators. It is much faster than Android and uses less power. The good news is that apps developers and working fast to develop their apps to work on harmony. So there may be a little lag time but you can bet that harmony phones will soon have all your favorite apps. What America has done is prevent their population from obtaining the latest and best tech items
It won&#39;t belong before trump starts a civil war, they will be begging Huawei to come back to create new jobs
If you can&#39;t beat them, ban them.
A few people in the US administration act in own case without any moral. They will not protect own companies, they destroy own companies and the income of millions of people.
I&#39;m  a Huawei  user and I will not stop buying  smartphones  from this company....for me Huawei has the best smartphones..!!! 👌👌✌🔥💪
Without Goole Huawei is incomplete..they have to collaborate with each other ...by security concerns..and user&#39;s data security concerns..
Damn you trump!
CLICKED JUST TO HEAR HIM PRONOUNCE HUAWEI😂
Need to stop china from spying on other countries it’s unacceptable and I am happy that they have been caught red handed and the world has now seen their true intentions and colour ✌️🙏🏼
USA banning huawei: <br>China stops making apple products:cha cha real smooth
Cod war in 1941-1991:Missiles, space race  ,assassinates ,spies<br>Cod war now:lets ban Chinese phone ,lets ban chinese apps like wechat
i hate Huawei  anyways xdd
I NEED GOOGLE<br><br><br>RIGHT NOW PLEASE BRING IT BACK I NEED IMPORTANT TO DOWNLOAD THE MISSING GAMES I WANT GOOOOOGGGGLLLLLEEEEE
They&#39;ll be back with whatever new administration
It’s xenophobia and anti free market disguised as “national security&quot;
I loved the intro before you said wassup guys
Omg thank you I was thinking of getting one 😫😭 am done 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️✌🏾🇲🇿❤
480p of your videos are 1080p of mine
Solution: Go Apple bruh!
I like how he avoids calling a Huawei a &quot;trash&quot; or something without google because it is😂😂
what a dick move...imagine if china pulls the same move on the usa: &quot;youre not allowed chinese products and chinese production anymore&quot;....the usa goes bankrupt quite literally the next day...
all you&#39;re guesses were that they banned it because it might destroy Apple market share but what if they planned to license IOS to Huawei phone??? piece of deca cake but the possibilities are there... To destroy Samsung naaaah I really don&#39;t think so
if spying is the future, what would be past-future?
Everyone: Huawei don&#39;t have google services and are now basically useless<br><br>Nick Minute: Here in 2021 Huawei have the largest app store of the globe. Their new operating systems are off the charts remarkable. Everything from there software, to their hardware is awesome. They no longer need google services at all.
Trump is heavily invested in Apple stock, and eager to push the US into 5G investments. Might those be his reasons for squashing Huawei?
I have an old Huawei phone. Got it 3-4 years ago. Other than a battery and power switch changed, the phone remain reliable with no drop of speed. I can&#39;t say the same with my Galaxy Note 5 and newer Xiaomi.
1 year later watching YouTube in Huawei&#39;s y6p which is running latest Android 10 and has all apps in appgallery
Still getting updates here
No Marcus the real reason is that the Us government is trying to bully  Huawei into giving them the 5G technology that the they the us can’t produce. Did you remember the stealing of the prototype phone send by Huawei to America via DHL? And it followed with the illegal arrest of the daughter of Huawei owner in Canada. This indicates that America is in serious trouble technologically.  WHEN SOMEONE SAID:  GIVE ME OR I KILL YOU. We all can recognize the bullying tactics. It’s probably a matter of 5-10 years max then America will fall just like England did and so is Rome before.  I don’t think this is a good way to get make yourself relevant technically again,  but now that the snake is out of the box  there will never be any trust even if things calm down.
Thx for doing this video without making it a political diatribe. You are one of the best yt content creators ever since you started.
Why would anyone use a Chinese Communist product who steals private information? DUMP HWAWEI
Huawei will succeed without USA products.
The issue is the privacy &amp; trade.<br><br>Kicker is that Government is starting this.
they just banned them because Huawei became more popular , not to mention their phone cameras are the best , even if you compare same pixel phones , my one camera huawei phone beats many phones with 2 cameras , Huawei should trive , they make quality phones that last
An apple a day keeps the doctor (hu)awei.
This is really informative, I own a Huawei p20 pro, had it for 2 years, amazing phone, amazing camera - have had hardly any issues with it at all, other than connectivity with Android Auto but now looking for a new phone similar to specs of the Huawei p20 pro, due to the 90 days now expired of google updates, was going to get the OnePlus 8 pro, but seen a few reviews on the oppo find x2 pro and your review on it, and I am going to look into that phone a bit more, its the only one I have found that is close to specs of the Huawei phone and is available to buy in the UK. <br>Sucks about Huawei being blacklisted by Trump though, best phone I have ever had, but who knows what can happen in the coming months..
USA : BANNED HUAWEI FROM USA , ( secretly called others to boycott ) <br><br>OTHER COUNTRIES :  NO , WEE NEED 5G FROM THEM &amp; CHEAP PHONE..<br><br>USA : FUCK YOU ALL  MOTHER FUCK.<br><br>CHINA :  RELEASED THE COVID !!!<br><br>USA : ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE.. DEAD DEAD DEAD...  KEEP COUNTING.. <br><br>CHINA : BANNED ME MORE PLEASE...<br><br>USA :   ........................................................
me a huawei user is scared of this happening, im scared of loosing my data and all the stuff i built over the years.
Spying on Americans they admitted to it. Collecting personal data and uploading to a database... alot of western countries are banning it.
Huawei become number 1...<br>USA is upset because they want to be first on everything!
just use google uk
They will stop making the kirin cjip.because it&#39;s USA technology
Someone needs to pull the dildo off this morons ass
Do you know about how uighur Muslims are being enslaved in China
You put other operating system , like black berry os to sand box Android applications
The question is whether Google continues spying on Huawei phones after the ban? I mean only spying, without further updates.
US can’t spy if you are using huawei equipments 🤣🤣🤣
They banned a spy phone. Didn&#39;t need a whole video
I dont know wtf u talk about. I have Huawei mate pro 30 whitout giving al my info to us gov (google) and still can use google shits, and i think china can do own. Everything we owned in this world was made by theam.
Me owning an xiaomi:**heavily sweating**im fine,for moment
Every government: Spies<br>Every government: Hey stop spying on us
Best thing US done was ban Huawei because it&#39;s sort of the same thing as putting a bowl of lollies in front of  a kid and saying you can&#39;t have any lollies 😂😂😂😂<br>Let&#39;s make Huawei so famous <br>I just brought the Huawei y9s and a ChiQ 55&quot; TV and will now only buy Chinese products and next will come the laptop 😊
Stay healthy everybody.
Don&#39;t let all of these distract you from his macbook art.
Me watching on honor 8x:  👀
Me watching in 2020 on my Huawei Y9S...
All lives matter!
I love how when watching a video a out huawei  i get an ad about huawei
I have this phone!
Did this lead to the tiktok ban?
All Huawei have to do is forget about Google play store and Google and come up with thier own app to replace the play store and Google .
Me who uses a Huawei phone and Tablet
Stop trumpeo dictactor!
America did the same when Phillips developed flat screen tvs and America was behind. Ban them and try to catch up
So much for free market lul
Just replace the whole Google store with China&#39;s alternaltive. and do what epic has done and offer a better commission rate.
Banning the gov employees using it, I got it. But what can they spy on regular people? My amazon shopping cart?
What about the 2 (two) Canadian business men that China put into prison because they &quot;thought&quot; they were spying? These guys still have not been released!
They can spy on their own people.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZGpmWrVSaU&amp;t=577">9:37</a> meanwhile me with my brand new p40 pro
I was thinking of switching from  Google to another search engine. Apple use their own operating system. This Google/US ban will cost Google and Apple any share of the huge  Chinese market. China will continue to ethically expand its economy without resorting to waging various kinds of economic warfare on dozens of countries all over the world. Check out the Barrett channel for some on the ground real info on China.
Why not just disconnect everything from other countries. A simple geo loc ip trace can be counted as spying. How about google map? Even with street view thats already considered as spying.
CHINA RETALIATION : CORONAVIRUS COVID 19
I can remind you without Google Huawei is more powerful go Google and check tommorow news Huawei beat Samsung worldwide and become most selling phones ...
But why don&#39;t they just offer 1bli dollars and maybe they will get Googles service
Keep in mind that the USA is only 5% of the worlds population. This opens up HUGE opportunities for other non-US companies to rise and fulfill Huawei’s needs.
Will Samsung be next?
Is it legal now to use huawei phones in US?
Huawei then probably tiktok
Tik Tok: Breathes Chinese
Are all chinese phones under this umbrella? Particularly one plus.
a stock DeGoogled phone great
Google knows where I am going.
A year later. They are the number one cell company 😁😁
Black live matters, Huawei live matters. Stop Trump virus!
What&#39;s all that in the video about Huawei not being allowed to run Android... Absolute nonsense Google don&#39;t own Android or have a say in who uses it.... The GMS ban is still in place. <br>Microsoft are in business with Huawei &amp; I&#39;m writing this on a Huawei Mate XS running android 10 with access to all the services on my phone I used before the ban although some things like Google Maps &amp; you tube I run desktop versions... Facebook mobile app works fine... It&#39;s just not a big deal not having GMS<br>The losers in the long run will be Google.
Huawei makes great phones, but under the subsidy of (foreign) state capitalism.   In the long run, it&#39;s not good for fair market capitalism.
My Huawei still has all of the Google services etc
Chinese electronics giant Huawei has overtaken Samsung to become the world&#39;s biggest smartphone maker in the second quarter (Q2) of 2020.
Clearly china is stealing tech from the U.S.
It&#39;s funny to watch this in July 2020!
Their handsets were making the competition look bad. Apples had some time to catch up now and Samsung have failed with copying the P40 with the S20 line up - Overall it had to be done to protect the interests of Apple and the US
Shit fuck Donald Trump just you are bold ass fucking shit
u.s.a Donald Trump is poop and pee
@mkbhd Can you update as at 1 August 2020?
Imagine if Samsung were based out of China. That would be very bad lol
Trump seems to have something against China
Márquez Brownlee can you please advise me on which phone between Huawei  p 10 Google pixle 2 is best cause I can&#39;t afford expensive phone  thanks and I will be waiting for you ,stay safe and healthy respect
Huawei didn&#39;t spy Trump was threatened by 5G
The demon-craZist usa is very angry &amp; Jealous at Great China who have shown how Great &amp; Superior China &amp; Chinese are, while the the despicable demon-craZist usa still have to grapple with their deep seated inferiority complex <br>For 1,800 of the last 2,000 years, China have been Earth&#39;s NUMBER ONE POWER ( this are facts &amp; history, can you imagine how prestigious it has been for Great China, how much it torments the west to feel inferior before a Superior ChinaMan<br>Only in the last 200+ years the west caught up with Great China<br>BUT in the last 30+ years Great China again surpassed the inferior west ( so these western inferiorist are very jealous &amp; angry at Great China)<br>Imagine the west needed 300+ years to catch up with China, BUT CHINA only took 30+ years to catch up and surpassed the inferior west<br>This is why the west are so jealous of Great Chinese, The Superior Great Golden Yellow Race<br>Chinese are very proud of being Chinese , proud of their History, proud of their only continuous Civilisation in the World. Only China lasted from 5,000 years till now, the same Superior China &amp; Chinese<br>Other civilisations became history and no longer existed<br>So can you see why the demon-craZist usa is so envious &amp; jealous of the Great Chinese, God&#39;s Chosen People, The Truly Exceptionals<br>So when you have a Great Golden Yellow Peril , it&#39;s simply delightful &amp; awesome!!!
Sometimes it sounds or looks like US think they can survive alone with no help from any other country .....haha is Trump cyber security specialist :D
If the US isnt carefull China will ban apple......
Bit late to the party. Anyone else just hearing about this? 2020
US is making mistakes <br>i know  china will make again comeback and hit US harder
if sheeple think Google or Android is not spying them or using there data not only for positive but mostly for negative purposes the whole human race is at risk and in extinction real soon that depopulation agenda is in auto mode
Is non educated non engineers in Washington not educated in nanoscience and high tech engineering, Way are they really really paranoid or thinking they will stop development going back to stone age.
I start a daughter company called GO GO le SPY to colloborate then.  And the AND Droid. American political stores are loosing out a lot just now. We will build our own stores instead and leave all of that old 4G stone age. will we have to leave that google and american company behind then ???
i have a question<br><br>will the old huawei phone models like huawei y9  be affected by this ban or will they still run Google?
That is a KNOCK OFF SAMSUNG PHONE ! ! ! ! ! !  !  ! And  i GUARENTEE YOU PAID LESS than the comparable to the Samsung Galaxy ! ! !  !  ! ! ! !  ! !! ! ! ! !
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZGpmWrVSaU&amp;t=43">0:43</a> huh wawei? Hmm I thought it was Huawei(as in Who-a-wei)
It&#39;s a shame, i have a p30 pro and iphone Xs and honestly i prefer p30 pro over iphone....So sad to see such a great company being banned from Google :-/
Xiaomi mi 10 youth phone about video plz  😀😀😀
It&#39;s been a good free advertising for Huawei and ZTE.  Not forgetting Ericsson and Nokia both have about 40% of their 5G products made in China and in joint ventures with Chinese companies. It will be interesting to see how things goes.
How much has Google lost in fees since. Billions per annum. Also China market will also move from Apple.
Huawei users literally can&#39;t see this video because it&#39;s on YouTube 😌
<b><i>NET_MACTOOL ON ÎG FIXED MY DEVICE</i></b>
“Google their a US company ,”he says....but it’s Owned by an Indian . So who’s the boss 🇮🇳😋😅
You are great at what you do dude. Keep it up
Trusting Huawei is like hiring a convicted paedophile as your nanny
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZGpmWrVSaU&amp;t=496">8:16</a> Bingo. If you can&#39;t compete with them, ban them. That seems to be the running motto of this terrible US administration.

You might want to let these knowledgeable people who think G5 came from china, you are an intelligent young man. Just inform them that G5 came from the real giant America. It was started by Verizon and not their beloved china. Ya their phones look like Apple  Interesting. By the way, I know Verizon started G5 because I worked at Verizon at The time  G5 was created. G5 was our brainstorm and we  wanted to get the idea across America. We were very excited about this project and realised it would get across the globe to companies who wanted to challenge The USA. So get your facts straight.
If google Facebook anything doesn&#39;t work in china so, why huwaei and tik tok work here <br>Tit for tat!!
Instead of saying huawei I say hawaii lol😂
bro  from where did you get your mac skin looks soo dope asf
US is a bully...but everything happens for good reason...hope huawei give something new ....end the monopoly of west....
2020 I think they are doing ok still
Everything about how much it is important for everyone but not a single word about how they should stop spying on other people, You were paid quite a bit for this for sure. Money beyond anything for youtubers
Update: Huawei is now number 1...Number 1 and they&#39;re banned from the US...That&#39;s pretty damn good. Sorry Apple.. Lol<br>But honestly it&#39;s a two way street. Apple needs parts from China just as bad, so it&#39;s terrible for them as well. I feel that Huawei and Samsung have a better chance in continuing the flow of products at a competitive rate.  Apple may have a hard time if they had to locally source all their components, and still provide the same price margins.<br>&quot;It&#39;s a super massive challenge to build your own app store&quot;....Sure, but wasn&#39;t that the challenge google had from the beginning? People need to stop look at Google being the &quot;God of all&quot; companies. By that logic Marques, new &quot;Youtubers&quot; shouldn&#39;t even try to make content as it&#39;s all done before and there are much more well-known &quot;Influencers&quot;...and look where you are now. Companies can still continue without google, and Huawei is showing that&#39;s possible. What OS do you think North Korea uses? Ever heard of Red Star OS?
wait what, android is open source, that means that anyone should be able to use/modify it and you don&#39;t need a license. THAT&#39;S THE ENTIRE POINT OF OPEN SOURCE! Huawei should be able to use android without google&#39;s license BC ITS OPEN SOURCE IN CASE GOOGLE DIDN&quot;T GET THE PICTURE OPEN SOURCE MEANS ANYONE CAN USE AND NO LICENCING AaAAAAAAH<br>Here is an excerpt from the preferred android open-source license, the Apache License v 2:<br>&quot;Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.&quot; <br>Huawei should still be able to copy and use the android source code regardless of the fact that the government says no business with google bc its open source and anyone can copy and use modified versions of it.
Its your own government you need worry about
This has to do with China exerting control over Hong Kong
That&#39;s why this country is not capitalism nor a democracy.  Look up Adam Smith, the father of capitalism, what he thinks capitalism is. There is no competition, this is a monopolistic economic system and why the middle class is shrinking and the 1 percent is buying more G5 jets.
Who&#39;s really going to benefit from the banning of Huawei 5G equipment?
Me: whispering to my wife 5g is banned.<br>Wife: why are you whispering??<br>Me: I don&#39;t want Mark Zuckerberg to hear me.<br>We all laugh. And soon enough Siri laughs, Alexa laughs
And after this the Coronavirus magically appears!
The US wants a larger cut of the pie.... That&#39;s all... Economics
Huawei banned july 15th 🇬🇧
Retaliation for covid 19  folks right here
Does the US have three mobile it setup 3g in the UK it&#39;s Hong Kong owned company now Hong Kong has lost its special status with the world after China ended it&#39;s international law of 2 system one country rule
Everything you use is spying on you for adds and now data mining, yet all the US companies are not mentioned or the Obama laws passed leaked by Snowden and wiki leaks
There are a lot of Chinese bots in the comment section. Something needs to be done about this issue.
All the people saying that companies like Google also track you so it&#39;s no big deal can&#39;t be anymore wrong.. The Chinese communist party owns Huawei and every other company in China. They are responsible for the most human rights abuse in most of the world. They have 2 million people in concentration camps.. They use AI in video cameras to monitor you anywhere you go and to persecute people for any reason they decided. They passed security laws where if you say anything they Chinese government doesn&#39;t like, you go to jail for life. This includes everyone in the world. So let say you live in Canada and you say something bad about the ccp there., if you step foot into a Chinese airport, you can be arrested and charge for life. You guys need to learn before you speak. This is coming from a person who owns a Huawei P30 pro and love it. But I will be switching to Samsung due to Chinese human rights abuses and global persecution of people..
Showed up on my feeds just when UK banned Huwaei 5G  H/W 😂😂
Trade decision,nothing to do with spying.
My dad’s Huawei lasted 5 years before he had to charge the battery daily. He’s so happy with it that he bought a P40. It meets all his current and possible future needs.
The CCP cannot be trusted. Socialism and communism is our real enemy.
So the H sounds like a W and the W is a W 🤔
This guy never bothered to mention about intellectual property getting stolen. Having chinese company in such a strong position might be a risk. All he cares about is his tech. But without mentioning shameless chinese companies copying. According to him that does not stop the growth
On street level, it&#39;s simply a case of banning consumer choice, is this democratic?
The first 15 seconds of this video are literally useless.
Huawei. You can do it. I believe in you. You show them.
Meanwhile market shares in smartphones from Q1 2018 to Q12020<br>Samsung	23.5%	21.2%<br>Huawei	11.8%	17.8%<br>Apple	15.7%	13.3%<br>Xiaomi	8.4%	10.7%<br>Sorry USA, guess it didn&#39;t work....
huewuei does way to much rediation😫
I bought huawei p40 lite and its frustrating -. -
Why YouTube algorithm
I am currently an upcoming 3rd year student at MIT (as of 12 July 2019 and as of 18y9m old) and I have a Chinese girlfriend born in HANOI Vietnam (18y7m old) named Linh Nguyen who have just upgraded from a Huawei Honor 5X to the Huawei P30 Lite back in 2019, despite the Huawei ban. She never accepted any Apple devices I gave her, and she also currently attends a community college in the Boston area (2nd year), despite her being very smart and capable since at BBNS, we both perform as one of the best. I am also an exchange student, but I am a Korean born in Russia, and my two primary phones are the iPhone 11 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G, and I am currently awaiting for the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra. I don&#39;t know why she refuses to use Apple and would only use Huawei products (she uses a Huawei MateBook Pro and she used multiple Huaweis throughout her life). She bought that Huawei when I took her on a trip to Europe last summer before the pandemic.
This sucks. I&#39;m currently using Huawei P20 Lite for, like three years or so. I love it, I&#39;m super satisfied customer. I have even replaced broken screen month ago for 10% of my salary, because it&#39;s still running as smooth as it was when I bought it. I was thinking about upgrade in 2021 and of course I wanted Huawei. But now... what&#39;s the alternative?
Me watching this on my p30 still on Android 9.1
I’m in Canada 😎 😎
Me watching this on my huawei 👁️👄👁️
Is this all fixed now?
Tiktok is next!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZGpmWrVSaU&amp;t=510">8:30</a> <br>Having them around is not good.  As many governmental agencies have found out that there has been many &quot;call home&quot; code in the devices.<br>Homeland security, CIA and even the FBI, secret service all used to use their products, and found out that their devices was pinging home &amp; sending data out over to China.<br>Hence why USA government immediately cut ties.  Last thing we need is a company that is actually listening to conferences &amp; tactical meetings that ANY <br>president is having in the war room.  Specially when USA government has Seal Team &amp; CIA and other agencies at risk because of these devices.<br>I understand you like Tech, I like Tech too....  But there are some companies who at face value seem to be a good company, but in the background they have alternative motives<br>and not telling anyone, UNTIL agencies like the CIA, FBI, Homeland Security and many other agencies figure out whats going on when one of their techs bump into some serious situations like this<br>on devices.<br>All this started when several white house devices was sending out data from the white house, and the Secret Service &amp; CIA intervened. <br>See, what people dont know is that when you are in the White House or  secured buildings like the White House,  your incoming and outgoing data is monitored.<br>Secret Service knows what that device is doing at all times,  even if you are only using your Carriers node and not on WiFi.<br>because each government building has a Carrier antenna YOU have to go through that they monitor. Because its inside the government building.<br>Hard to explain over Text on youtube.  Anyways, you get monitored, and all that data they know the IP&#39;s and locations of communications.<br>Again, this happened in the White House when Obama was in office,  6 phone devices was sending data out, and secret service found out that its been calling home to China.<br>Hence why government banned their devices.  This was on the news and well explained on many news stations live telecasts.<br>When the Secret Service found out about the massive data calling home, they investigated the communicating IP&#39;s which included China.<br>6 of those devices was actually in conference in the white house. The Secret Service also found out that those devices was on constant monitoring , just like Alexa,<br>meaning it would constantly listen.  And knowing those devices was in the white house.....  well you can clearly guess what happened. - then the ban started.
Huewei is a good phone, but they clearly spy on people and are owned by the CCP. It&#39;s like supporting a North Korean company. Just google all the atrocities china does to it&#39;s own people and you will never support Huewei.
Well u could use a vpn to make it so ur in a us country and use google
Trump is an idiot.
One year later.. I feel like this was a good idea to ban them.
There is nothing  complex in this topic , Huawei is cut of from Google for same reasons why Apple cut of everyone  from their Apple services . That is because if you want to be a part of that you need to pay for it . Now Google has a problem , its Free software so they cant charge for it , however they can charge to manufacturers  for licences ,  and they do  Huawai is not a big fan of that .<br>And there is another reason for it , and that is that global corporations need to distinguished cheap products from more expensive ones .  Because technically they cant , its all the same ,so they do it by software . Cheap phone , you dont get Google ,  more expensive one you do .<br>This will grow , its just a start others will join  google is just first to do so .<br>Slowly they will make everyone pay for everything on the internet , free or not .
So will my Huawei phone become usless and all my apps will get deleted?
Why don&#39;t they just do business with Google Australia?
I hope Samsung is the next!
Amazon free products, no need to buy, no need to review，If you are interested, please contact me,Tell me what number you want.
1 year later. Many countries will be banning Huawei
Anything coming out of China should be banned including Apple
HUAWEI was sending data across US.. So ban is fair.
When Trump no longer is president this will hopefully change
who keeps listening to this elitist apple fanboy? yep me
Well, once again teh USA has decided for the rest of the world what we should and shouldn&#39;t buy and use
ALSTOM, TOSHIBA, and now HUAWEI. F**k America.
You can get spied upon from any network whether cisco,nokia,or Huawei. I&#39;ll go for cheaper Samsung phones
i&#39;m from China and can confirm, HUAWEI is trash
amazon is now a trillion dollar company on of 2
I love your content Marques. You’re well spoken and knowledgeable, and thanks to your reviews I’ve made many decisions on tech purchases that I’m happy about. Thanks
Huawei should ban in India
Trump from USA just scared China be no.1 country one day.. so he started ban here and there?????? haha<br><br>it&#39;s good news to samsung lol
I think I&#39;ll be fine I mean I bought my phone nearly a year ago
That moment when you <b>JUST</b> bought a Huawei phone<br><br>Me: oooo fuggg
One down hopefully we blacklist more and move to apps
Huawei is going down my sister won huawei Y6P AND MY PARENTS GOT COMPLICATED
The play store is an app so if they make a phone that is compatibility with android apps, the play store could be added after the phone is sold.
7.7k dislikes. All china
In The Future<br><br>Me : Orders A P90 online.<br>Also me : Why Did you give me a Gun
What if huawei is working with apple?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Google: <b>Can&#39;t rid with this dude</b>
TRUMP is the only common denominator in everything negative a distructive taking place in the USA today.
Nice video.
usa : if you can&#39;t beat them &#39; ban them
So if I buy a second hand P8 lite on 2020 is there literally no google apps?? Playstore? All the games and apps?
I love the fact that he didn’t criticize trump at all just in case it might be controversial and sound biased
Huawei is too good for America, you don&#39;t even need google for a Huawei, they will have their own search engines and apps.
Just bought Huawei yesterday completely American free, everything works well.<br>Huawei focuses on biggest market, Asia. <br>The ban make US companies lost 11 billion dollars, well done Trump lol<br>BTW FB, IG, UT, Gmail, Gmaps and Google search all work fine lol<br>Thousands of apps can be downloaded from APKPure nothing blocked if using Oprah explorer.
Huawei was growing too fast and apple didn&#39;t like that
I know I&#39;m late to this video and probably won&#39;t get a reply, but couldn&#39;t they just buy the software from Samsung or something like that?
I like your reviews :)
Haters always trying to bring the best smart phone down :)
Linux,would be my choice it&#39;s free it would be easy yo port over apps and you could have a full desktop in your phone. Games from steam and windows have been coming to the platform as well. It failed last time but on much lesser hardwear.
1 year later ... fuck the ban, they do just fine i own a huawei and i don&#39;t give a fuck about google
Love the intro music... Its so fresh!
All chinese phones don&#39;t use google services, you have to ask for them to install google services onto the phone, there are plenty of different chinese app stores...
China: <b>Gets banned for spying on people.</b> <br><br>Google: &quot;Let me step right in, I&#39;ve got things to invent.&quot;
That&#39;s because the United States doesn&#39;t want Huawei to continue to develop, it needs to suppress Huawei.
China has banned Google, Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Wikipedia, Reddit, Tumblr, PInterest, Instragram, Dropbox, Medium &amp; Flickr.<br>US has banned Huawei. <br>Fair?
Trump is officially hated by everyone
Jokes aside, China does not hesitate developing technologies and policies that violate human rights and freedom. As Huawei has a close relationship with CCP, it might be appropriate to ban this company from expanding globally.
Nice
There are bigger questions, than you raise, but with a shallow understanding of where the CCP would put you, for only expressing disfavor, dissatisfaction or any criticism of the CCP, people have not included ALL the costs of surrendering to China&#39;s lead in 5G.
Everyone commenting Google, facebook, etc... You&#39;d rather have communist china spy on you rather than an American private company (yeah they sell your data, but not to a communist country)?
And 1 Year after this Video it turned out to be pretty wrong. I use a Mate 20 pro and I have a fully functional Google Services Phone getting updates
Dude has a sloth laptop... Did you get it from Timmy Ham himself?
Huawei dominantes the 5g market, sells more than apple and were about to sell more than samsung.<br><br>There is everything you really need to know
competition is always better for da consumer... ppl who want competition dead cant rlly call themselves tech eunthusiasts if they like to slow down innovation
Will this affect huwawi phones in other countries
It&#39;s 2020 and my huawei phone keeps getting android updates (security patches)
meanwhile google assistant when I say ok google : your mic is turned off
Why other Chinese phone companies can do business with Google then?... Please explain it
I mean,,, this video getting recommended is ok but a video from 2009? oh no that&#39;s another level
Actually USA wants a world order. I don&#39;t want that. I ditched my overheating iphon 7 plus and got my pro40 without Google play.
Samsung is just sipping Tea at the back.
guys think of this. do you have routers ? yes. where are made? the routers have procesors, ram memory, and every component from a pc. or a phone? so if china want to spy... belive me is more more easy to use a router.
waita minute is the the ridge wallet guy lol
F*** Trump ...
Lol im not in united states im in australia and plus i still don’t have any interest in huawei im more of a samsung liker so yea
Well. Guess they shouldn’t have been spying. Fucking morons
God is the mic attached to the desk I can hear the hits every time you touch the desk
So in the US the president is allow to kill a company just because he doesn’t like it
WHEN HE SAID PERIOD KDKELFPFPR
I had look up the pronunciation for Huawei because he keeps saying Wowway and apparently, yes, that is  the normalized English pronunciation. Very odd since the Chinese pronunciation isn&#39;t even difficult
Watching this a year later on an up to date Huawei phone
USA: Oh Huawei, I heard your spying on us? That&#39;s just not allowed. You would never do such a thing right google?<br>Google: <b>sweating profusely</b>
<b>Google</b> basically <b>bans Huawei</b> in the U.S because they&#39;re <b>chinese</b> and <b>the chinese are communists.</b>
Man I loved huawei but I can&#39;t live without Android,Trump just kinda murdered Huawei phones.
i’ve never even heard of it until today
So .... why exactly Huawei was banned from America ?
China is the worst evil country, screw them and their products
Has anyone tried Opensource Android with Google services?<br>I&#39;m considering using Huawei P40Pro. Will harmony OS work apps outside China?<br>I wasn&#39;t too overjoyed with the google-COVID app tracker forced on us.
Huawei was partial funded by CCP,
It&#39;s just funny how trump tries to stand loyal to American companies like apple and therefore abuses his power.
Its funny how I got an Huawei add lol
Remember guys, the U.S. government spies on you already, that&#39;s 100% confirmed, however there is no conformation that the Chinese government was spying on U.S. customers. Just let that sink in for a little.
Who cares... im watching this on huawei
when US kidnap their founder&#39;s daughter. U know their product is good..
Harmony os
Huawei: <b>Holy shit I am growing fast af.</b><br>Trump: <b>You played yourself</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZGpmWrVSaU&amp;t=278">4:38</a> Sony!?<br>Wasn&#39;t Leica manufacturing cameras for Huawei.
You&#39;ve gotten many many things wrong so allow me,<br><br>This has absolutely nothing to do with the ceo selling things to iran or anything to with spying. Both of these arguements are laughable. Fuck you trump, your a liar and a theif.<br><br>Normally competitions in markets is an incredibly useful thing Democracy and capitalism but not for the us i guess.<br><br>The company is banned for 3 reasons, advances 5g tech, advanced 5g comms and comms production, and incredibly good for phones.<br><br>1.The company has created a 5g technology tha thg is superior in function to regular 5g, its years ahead of its competitors and much more developed and reliable. Its not replicated easily at all which is frustrating for other companies attempting to steal it. 2. Its easy to be a cellphone manufacturer,  but Huawei is much more than that. Its a company that builds and develops and owns its comms network. If that got into the us it would literally blow att and any others head off. The company itself is incredibly efficient and talented. Not only that but they can do it all at a better cost. 3. Their phones are just stunning, p30 like outperforms my samsung note9 in performance. The design is also more lightweight. Great screens, great cameras, great processors,  all of this is done at a great price point again, blowing the balls off apple att , all of them. <br><br>The CEO was accused of selling secretes to iran. Can you imagine apples Microsofts or Samsung&#39;s ceo getting put in jail for anything like this? This is a ridiculous claim. Huawei would never ever ever sell their technologies development/ structural information to ANYONE let alone iran,  and if Huawei wanted to SELL/ provide physical comms network and sell phones to iran it wouldnt NOT be illegal. ) the us had tried itself to develope other countries yet fails all the time and jeeps them outdated and poor. And if this is the case then toyota should have its ceo thrown onto death row for their trucks in iran. <br><br>They then said it was due to spying : others contries has conducted their own investigations and huaweii is being incredibly transparent about its services. No nature of spying has ever been found by any of the investigators for example Germany. The company clearly states on its website it has absolutely no connection to any goverment or government agency. employee or shareholder, none of them are government officials if any kind. <br><br>Now getting on to the phones. What you have said is epically wrong as far as phone use in the us. You can buy a Huawei phone in the states online perfectly fine. That phone, comes naturally unlocked and will work with any micro sim you put in it. You can update it and it automatically updates just like any other phone and you CAN use any google service you like and it will update those apps totally fine. How do i know this? I have one, it works fine. The p40 does not come with google installed on it. But again, you can install whatever you want to onto the phone as long as you have an apk for it. Huawei has its own app store aswell and its completely dope with most common apps and if not you can download it just fine on your own. I have netflix, snapchat, Twitter, google maps all the normal bs youd find anywhere else. <br><br>Also, I use my Huawei in the states with mint mobile. I dont give a shit about this executive order, trump and all these other lobbiest can eat a seriously big sea cucumber. I love my phone and will continue to buy them, its my right at a citized in a democratic, capitalist society.  The only reason the us doesnt want people to have their phone is because its so kick add- doesn&#39;t that piss you off and just want one more? Fuck you trump, and Melania is going to divorce you as soon as you get out of that office.
It&#39;s not entire true.. I use Honor View 10 and I have the latest Android version
I bought my sister a p30 pro a few weeks ago and she is still getting updates for Os
The whole info you just gave was ditto copied in a video for the same subject and posted just after 1 day of this video by @techburner
Who else is here from JerryRigEverything?
A new video with current updates would be awesome!
marques looks like he would be a stock football player in a fifa game<br><br>the argument happening in the reply section is completely useless
Actions unclear,<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now I&#39;m banned from the United states
Well... I just bought my new Huawei Nova T5 and it has everything from google (chrome, play store...). explanations?
I came here for Jerry
Government:NOOOOOO YOU CANT SELL GOOD PRODUCTS<br><br>Huawei: money machine go Brrrrrrrrrt
Watching on a Huawei phone
Do these still get updates? I&#39;ve been thinking about getting a P30...
There  a company ahead  of its time
Our favorite boi Markass brownleeeee!!!
Um, yeah, you can make PC without windows. Itx called Linux bro, its 2020, surprised you have never heard about it! Speaking of Linux, there is now a version for mobile thats being developed since like 2010. Huawei is big company. They will make thier own OS. Its time Google moved over.
Sorry but the way the guy is saying Huawei really bothers me
Man, Trump is slowly trying to isolate us from other countries. First Mexico, now China. Who&#39;ll be next?
FBI : <b>Hey! We are the only one who can do that!</b>
Watching this with an Huawei!!!<br>Hope it doesn&#39;t read thoughts!!!
6,9 million views<br>nice
Yeah they spying on USA . Not a big fan of China . But last time when the USA say 1) gulf of Tonkin ,and destroyed whole Vietnam, later on found to be a lie 2) Iraq having chemical weapons . Which too was a lie. USA is a bully. If he finds out you have something better than him or you are occuping trade . Then he starts playing the foul game . land of free and brave , their own land being occupied by killing local red Indian&#39;s .
Are Americans Hypocrites or something?
Ban and boycott huawei.<br>We need economic distancing with china.
Watching this on a Huawei
I&#39;m a big big fan of Huawei od Asian brands... I blame Trump. I can&#39;t wait till he is done. I&#39;m very sure he collaborated with Google to turn down Huawei. Or got pressured from Trump stupid claims that China is spying on us🙄🙄🙄I am not a big fan of Apple. Trump is making an Enemy. China will always ways be a giant country. Remember it grew on its own without outside influences.
I used Huawei P20 Pro since it came out. I pre ordered it before hand. So I probably belong in thay 1% in USA Huawei consumer. But if Huawei is 2nd from Samsung without selling Huawei on regular on USA base. What does that tell you? Imagine If it&#39;s sold here in USA🙄
Aw I have a p10 lite
idk if u noticed but he says wauwei
Thank you for saying that I could not pronounce the name
Time to hack Huawei&#39;s ... What if google sees a Huawei phone as a Samsung? :))))
that&#39;s total bs why would US think that Huawei is spying on them ( the video is not bs whats bs is that US thinks that they are spying on them)
Huawei is a fu_k sh_t THIEF and they fu_king spy on everybody tech
An Apple a year makes your money disapper
just bought a y6p... <br><br><br><br><br>now im watching this on the browser cause youtube cant run... :/
The ZTE ban was reversed shortly after it was imposed. ZTE had plenty of their own problems.
A year from this, I still find it weird that they singled out Huawei right after they beat Apple in the market sales and consumer preference.
Nothing about Google is US. They are too powerful to still be considered anything other than a National and even Global threat.
We know the USA does not like that China has passed the USA in most ways economically, so the Huawei Ban case is just one symptom of this.<br><br>But Huawei has the resources to bypass the problems this ban creates, and they can aim to create a) They can create a far superior social website <br>than Facebook, b) They can create a far superior search engine than Google if based 100% on what is relevant and not frequency at all, c) They can create far superior games than Google offers, d) They can create a far better ecosystem for user experience and user value than Apple offers, and in fact we have reached the point in which offering ever better and  better user value is the best way to stand out from the competition when we can not expect major new technological advances worth upgrading for every year.  I have studied how to sort and absorb information and knowledge more effectively, so what I think of is not merely wishful thinking, and we have already the technology for doing what I think of.
typical american If you cant beat them ban them 😅🤣 coward
Is there a way you can explain this with puppets??
Keep in mind every company in China is owned by the Chinese government and look at their track record over the past 50 years
So then how come Xiaomi still uses android
&quot;No China Made&quot; Good for the world!
This isn&#39;t about a trade war or politicking, it&#39;s about a fascist state using controlled tech to violate peoples civil rights; who would support Huawei in this?
From the perspective of a customer, I feel like I&#39;m choosing which company to spy on me, and it doesn&#39;t feel good at all.....
I have a question.. why us companies are so restricted by the us government, or they don&#39;t want to make the deal with Huawei at the first place?
WUMAO
&quot;COMMUNIST BANDIT&quot;
Simple answer JEALOUSY..Huawei is killing Apple iPhone products..
Well Huawei are fudged now aren’t they!!
Me after the 90 days extension: Laughs using the android 10 with the p 20
Rightly banned because they spy. It’s the Chinese way: cheating is viewed as the smart thing to do. Everybody will get it and they will be banned. Good effing riddance.
The difference is Google and Facebook have to follow laws in place to protect user data while Huawei doesn&#39;t. It has been known that Huawei equipment has had significant security risks. Not necessarily back doors but easily hackable security. Also they are known to pay off government lawmakers to propose and vote for legislation that would benefit their company. Look if you don&#39;t care about the security risks then more power to ya. But allowing their tech into say a 5g network can pose significant security risks. How can you send sensitive information over a network that isn&#39;t secure.also since Huawei has to follow any order given them from the communist party. Say they are capable of censoring speech sent over their network signals. There is a significant risk involved with Huawei and their equipment.
Ban Huawei ban China ban every products of China, save the world.
Doesn’t apple manufacture phones in China? Can’t Huawei then ban Apple in China?
very sad for Huawei. I&#39;m using a Huawei phone, it&#39;s a very good phone.  I think Huawei is not really a problem. what I saw that upset the U.S was their association with the CCP.  The news media has reported many bad things about the CCP such as Human Rights abuses, Organ harvesting, prosecutions of Christians, stealing of intellectual property rights, etc...
China should cancel Apple&#39;s contract 🤣🤣
Man this sucks, I got the P20 and it still works perfectly after 2 years. <br>I really don&#39;t want to replace this phone by another but I really do want to keep using google&#39;s services. Anyone knows if these services will be deleted in the future?
Fuck China
The first video I decided to watch on my new phone :)
It&#39;s funny how MKBHD doesn&#39;t mention how Huawei is owned by Chinese communist party that is spying on the US citizens.
The last 5 months:<br>-250,000 dead and counting worldwide<br>-21,00,000 phones silenced in china<br><br> What amazes me, is how time and time again, groups of lemmings like yourselves think your smarter than Trump, only to be proven wrong in the most embarrassing of ways.<br><br>Still waiting for stormy Daniels to sink him, still waiting for his taxes to sink him, still waiting for his tweets to sink him, still waiting for avenatti to sink him, Still waiting for mueller to sink him, still waiting for his impeachment, still waiting for covid to sink him.<br><br>Why? <br><br>LOVE TRUMPS HATE, EVERYTIME, AND HE LOVES AMERICA<br><br>Trump 2020- making America great again!
So many ppl here pro huawei, i mean meh whatever but i do genuinely think they are a security risk being so closely tied to the communist party.. I don&#39;t feel sorry for them at all, they are doing just fine so.
This ban made me buy a Huawei. I can`t support the imperialist US Goverment.
Wanna bet that Apple/Microsoft have something to do with this
That&#39;s pretty rascist.
Whst now😢
US bans a chinese company and here in India my Huawei is in limbo ☹️☹️☹️
It’s because Huawei pricing is well below the competition and other companies would have to start lowering prices. Why start lowering prices when you can just eliminate that company. And what easy way could they get the people to turn against the company? By saying they’re spying and stealing your info. Done.
So, if i were to buy a p30 pro now, does it come with android and google services?
Thanks for the info, always nice to hear your input!
and 8 months later China unleased its Wuhan Virus, now Marquee Brownlee knows why
I truly think Donald Trump is a fool, the reasons: 1. more than $11 billion Huawei purchase last year was to US companies, who will buy those product now? 2. Huawei will make their own OS, The domestic market alone would make that very economically feasible, 2 plus billions consumer. On the other hand what if iPhone is boycotted by the Chinese people? 3. The biggest thing for Huawei is not cellphone, 5G is, and they are the leader on that. 4. Huawei will buy those companies that buy from US companies, then those companies will stop buying product/parts from US companies. China can make everything the US can and more. 5. The world is very well aware that they are being spied by Google, Facebook, etc. The world are longing for alternatives, this is just an incentive to develop the alternatives combined with 5G features. Who will be the biggest loser?
You are paid by Huawei?  Chinese government is corrupting the world by buying influential westerners including youtubers.
Fuck China
I need to read more on this... because their ban is  “they might” spy on us :/ makes no sense. How can we ban a company with some of the best lenses, when we have 90% of our country owning a cellphone assembled in china? like they wouldn’t or couldn’t stick something on iPhones to spy on people. 0.o not to mention we have already allowed every US company to spy on us the moment we sat on that Starbucks using their WiFi. Yeah we can use VPNs but lets admit it almost no one truly uses it, or only uses it to watch Japanese Netflix.
good!! i hope huawei can be ban in most country! I DONT WANT HUAWEI! EVEN MODEM.
Huwei phones looks ultimate and price is like heaven
“You wont get anymore software updates”<br>Galaxy S9 users: “oh yeah nothing to worry about”
Chat: Huawei has been struck by the BANHAMMER
I promised myself from now on other phone is going to be Huawei
“Why did you ban Huawei”<br>“Because they stole our 5G technology!”<br>“We don’t have 5G technology”<br>“Exactly! Because they stole it!”<br>“......”
It is troubling how many Americans are falling for this CIA PROPAGANDA - as if all the other manufacturers and the US government would not possess the exact same spying capabilities! It is beyond comical and even those, very rarely found, clever Americans are falling for this BS. It is propaganda, nothing more and every government can spy on you, if they want to.
Hey, Aron wheen you u gonna plan a new phone Giveaway_?  I&#39;m a beginner entrepreneur and I need a phone to work
Dude, this was the worst ban, I had the p30 pro and now my phone is completely useless
Corona virus phone should be banned
👍
Isn&#39;t it possible to do business with the Google businesses in Ireland? Those are de jure an Irish business.
Trump don&#39;t want us to have a p40
Watching this on my P30
Any one watching on huawei
Wawei
guys stop hating on trump
Thank god though nothing bad has happened yet with Google and Samsung which means Samsung doesn&#39;t have a ban so thank god also this bad tells us that Samsung should&#39;ve bought android when they had the chance but unfortunately for some reason they did not
Samsung already got the Galaxy store I&#39;ve been on the Galaxy Store and it&#39;s neat but we would want all of our fav Google apps also Samsung&#39;s ui is loveable but without Google I&#39;m not sure what Samsung users that love Google will do
Thank god u made this vid so I can get a better understanding about this ban
<b>Looks at comments</b><br>AW, I too like to get bend over by the Chinese Government. <br>Tell me did you all get 50cents too?
Is it only me or u too hate the new comment design
I need  the iPad  pro
Things cannot be banned. -marc27
I think Huawei will sell their company...
Just look at (made China 2025)
it used to be Russia here Russia there, but now it China China
Lmao I just bought a Huawei p30 pro like 4 days ago and now I see this
here over the pond in the u.k if you own a p30 or p30 pro,  then you will still continue to receive updates,  and patches. and all google products. i have just updated the software on my p30 pro,  software version 10, i can still play call of duty,  mobile,  and shadowgun legends, even though i am a 49 year old vet,  i like my shooters and dont have to worry about not being able to update anything from the google playstore. only devices which are newer here in the u.k are banned or wont receive google services anymore. so if you live in the u.k your good to go if you live in u.s.a then its pretty much F.U.B.A.R with regards to the p30  phones there is no 90 day period either its just given a pass
maaaan, what phone do you not own any way
Wish Huawei does not exist.
Ban still ongoing in 05/2020. Such a shame. I really like P40 Pro but without Gservices its useless to me :/
@marques brownlee clearly you haven’t been to China and used their phones there. Just like you said, you can use the android software w/o doing business with google. They already have their own App Store and google and it’s products are already banned for the netizens. They just have to make other people used to it
Huawei should always and forever remain banned.
Can Huawei phones work in the Caribbean ?
Us: our coming 5g will not spy.<br>Huawei:🤣🤣 keep sleep ahead<br>VPN:if you can&#39;t spy,who au?<br>Samsung:😝😝🤣us lol
US govt are a bunch of thiefs<br>They&#39;re just trying swallow the world whole and they control mainstream media and lie about everything Period
Trump is acting like a jealous first grader. how did he become a president?
i will only buy chinese phones only if american carrier supports chinese new phone.  way cheaper.  Best bang for my money.  The usa spy on u dumb ppl anyway.
Its all game about 5g huawei is way ahead in 5g technologies than American companies
trump is a stupid peice  of shit, cant wait for Biden to get voted in after the November election so huawei can get google services again, fuck samsung and apple
It&#39;s funny how lots of people are defending China 😂 They don&#39;t just spy through phone. They rip off anything they can get their hands on...
I like apple and its design and all my electronics are Apple. But honestly I’m thinking about switching to Huawei, because I hate bully.
China copied everything it has today from Western tech, iPhone format was copied by phone manufacturers all over the world. I have used a chinese smartphone as a work phone and an apple iPhone as my personal phone. The Chinese phone had load of issues, including shocking security issues with constant hacking. The apple iPhone, was Miles ahead in both quality and security, as I had zero issues with hacking.
China uses spycams installed in chinese people&#39;s phone so they could find out who are the HK protestors.<br><br>Edit: The business law in china is companies have to be loyal(or contribution) to the chinese government(or the country) and the CCP is really really corrupt.
safe huawei, pray Trump to get corona
You have such low standard, it&#39;s 2020, huawei once again got caught using DSLR advertise their camera,  how many times they have to lie, until you say enough is enough?
Planet earth: hey trump, i think you&#39;re right.<br>Trump: yeah yeah am always right cuz am the trumpster.<br>Google, Facebook, Youtube, instagram, Twitter, Tiktok: but why?<br>Trump: Kong flu, you know what i mean....<br>Google, Facebook, Youtube, instagram, Twitter, Tiktok: ok you win!<br>Planet earth: thats why he is the Trumpster, am kicking Em into space.
Where is the explained part?
Why would the government reverse things? When China is using them to spy on America. And why was the Cfo of Huawei  arrested by the united states government!
What do you think of the ban now?
I feel real sorry for the dumb asses  who think that facebook and google are completely innocent. Like, you don&#39;t have any problem with them &quot;stealing&quot; your data? Huawei will recover, in a year or 10 i dunno, but they will. Fun fact: Their research campus has their own tram service.
γαμω τον Τραμπ ρε μαλακες. τι φταίνε όσοι εχουν huawei και δεν ειναι απο την κινα
If you can&#39;t beat them, block them   US policy.
Trump is an idiot.
Hi tomorrow I will move from iPhone<br> to Huawei P 40 Pro 5G... NICE!!!!
Hah couple months later huawei anouncment of harmony os <br><br>Huawei: Bitch pls I won&#39;t go down! No matter what
ive just bought the p40 pro and thanks to this ban i cant get my online banking app for my new phone i cant say im best pleased about that. But that didnt make me change my mind about buying this phone and i think google is in for a nasty surprise if you take a look at Huawei app store now it amazing how much they have on offer now in such a short time. Also i wouldn&#39;t be surprised if all the other china phone manufactured phone companies drop google because lets face it what they have done to zte and Huawei could happen to them how much would that cost google.
USA thinks huawei will do same things as America has been spying for  years and huawei not opening backdoor for USA to spy around the world through huawei phone .. hats up for huawei to fight back. What doesn&#39;t not kill you makes u stronger..huawei phones are futurist..
Can someone tell me how this guy is making money without placing Ads on his videos....
Can u still buy Huawei phones in the US
&quot;Marc Ass Brown&quot; Will Smith.
That intro 🎵
This is the end of an empire or the beginning of an empire.
.. Yeah thx Trump now all the planet needs to suffer.
Can you please make a review on itel s15
Trump: if I can&#39;t beat them, ban them. simple and easy.
Security risk my ass. Samsung is paying America to keep them on top. Samsung is a South Korean company(our buddies!) and we HATE Chinas communism(expect when they are making our stuff for pennies. Like how that works?). Do the math folks.
Lol as soon as china threatened to ban American companies in America<br>Trump lifted the ban
basically there done
How do I update my phone then?
Knowledge never lost its position US and Google thinks that they will win I don&#39;t think so because the sun never hide by 2 fingers.
I hate it when Google ban huawei so I can&#39;t update any social media anymore... everything just stuckk :///
Huawei is a blessing. Finally a device that ordinary people can afford
US is lucky China ain&#39;t bitter like them. Picture China bans apple product in China.
JAPAN&#39;S 5 G IS BETTER AND WHY CAN &#39; T UK, A COUNTRY WITH THE BEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD,  DEVELOP THIS THING?.
A year down the line, the story is a little different
They probably will be able to do business in the US once Trump is out of office.
Google : why did you ban blah bla <br>Trump : blah blaha blhalala <br>Facebook : blah blah alallalalla <br><br>Comment section is full of this shitty joke  .
In light of huawei&#39;s ties to the CCP, and CCP cover up the Coronavirus which caused the current pandemic, what do you think about Huawei now?
I really hope someday Huawei will be the one laughing.
Well in Australia they’ve banned Huawei from using our 5G so I’m not surprised that this would happen
I just love to hear you speak ☺️
All these comments are the same and I hate it
I&#39;ll never get any Huawei phone again because they work with harmony os and no Google so i&#39;ll get<br>Samsung <br>Oppo<br>Mi<br>Sony<br>Apple (iphone)<br>And lg
This is horrible news for foldable phones. 😟
I am personally an Apple user and will probably remain so. But this is the shitiest way to avoid competition. I hope huawei recovers!
we need to get away from google
move to china they have 5g
The trade war between the United States and China has caused that technology innovation like 5G doesn&#39;t exist, political issues have slowed the implementation of these technologies. We&#39;ll have to see how the NSA continues to believe that these technologies can be a risk for the United States instead of regulating them now.
So I just want to ask...Huawei p30 pro can use Google chrome or not
US is scared of China
Damn I really want that huawei foldable. I really hope trump and the gang rethink this ban
When Americans spy on the world its called &quot;Security&quot;, when China does it it&#39;s suddenly a threat..smh
you are living in a country where its okay to ban Huawei witout any evidence.... Shame on you...
No Android updates no problems
