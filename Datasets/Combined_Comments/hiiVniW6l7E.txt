If i get a foldable phone it’ll be when apple does it
Nah, not feelin it.
ik it sucks but the reality is that a phone that folds will have a crease
Why tho?
But it&#39;s not glass.
I would never buy another Samsung Z Flip, where the screen fold the plastic cover on the screen has lifted and now has dust between it and the glass screen. It&#39;s 5 months old, I have sent it back to be repaired just for Samsung to tell me the damage was done by me now I have to pay for a new screen. I&#39;m willing to pay for the new screen even tho I didn&#39;t damage the z flip screen, it&#39;s been two months now without the phone and everytime I call them they have different excuses why I don&#39;t have my z flip back. I couldn&#39;t wait any longer and I could of bought the new z flip 5g but not after all the lies and stuff around from Samsung. I will never buy another Samsung phone again, instead I bought the new Motorola Razr 5g and Wow it&#39;s a much better phone. The Motorola Razr even looks like a flip phone, not like the Samsung Z Flip looks like a lady&#39;s small makeup  case.. Be Ware of the Screen on your Z Flip, shame on you Samsung 👎👎
You should check out the z flip 2 (it is an tablet thing)
Idk why bit foldable phones seem dumb to me.
Its 22:9
Imagine being the engineers who are creating these folding phones are hearing reviewers complain about the crease !?
The pastoral leather thankfully grab because cable spectacularly unite except a bright buzzard. delirious, handsome area
I love this smartphone
I really want one but I just can&#39;t justify the price with a lesser screen and battery life 😫 maybe they&#39;ll sort it out on the next couple modles
Why do u call urself kbdhc whyyyyy I want to know please tell reply
Its glass, what a fucking joke bro. :v its plastic.
Imagine Apple dropping a folding phone...
I dont think anyone would need that unlike a Fold 2
The Z Flip is so absolutely stunning. The design is 100% on point. Also love the tiny camera preview / clock on the cover.
No matter how hard u scratch the screen of the z flip, u can still rub it off
i reeeeeeally like that folding phones are coming back, but my wallet reeeeeeally doesnt like the price. dont know if you have pay as you go over there where you just top up your credit, thats how i do it here (uk), &amp; I don&#39;t use my phone much so dont top up much. paying monthly or over 1k for sim free is out of my price range at the moment.
I really do like the phone I think Samsung is a generation or two from perfecting the folding phone but it&#39;s a very big improvement over the original fold just like the fold Z 2 is a big improvement over the over the flip and the first fold...I&#39;m definitely considering buying generation 2 of the flip I can&#39;t wait till you do a full review of it
second tiny screen is good for letting other people see themselves if you are taking a pic of them (called cover screen preview)
Why dont they make to glass screens at connect the with strong bendy plastic in the middle
Looks like the iPhone 6... If you know you know
I believe the best folding phone is iphone6 👁👄👁

Folding phones: <b>Creating problems without there being any.</b>
I honestly find it intriguing but what is the durability of the phone?? Keep us updated!
Hypothetically couldn&#39;t the first half the phone be made out of glass and then where the folding happens they use the utg?
Poor people buy luxuries first, rich people buy luxuries last. If you want to be rich sacrifice yourself from glitters things.
Excellent overview!
Dude it’s a foldable phone! Ofcourse you gonna feel the crease! Give it a break
Again am here
I&#39;d rather wait for apple to release theirs.. 20 years from now LOL
There&#39;s absolutely no need for flip smartphones, they&#39;re just playing with people&#39;s nostalgia
I hope it doesn&#39;t explode like note 7
Gameboy emulators are looking better and better.
it&#39;s ridiculous that samsung did not put a big screen on the outside. this will probably come with the next x-axis foldable phone from samsung
it&#39;s horizontal folding
Man this phone is ugly
dude this phone has more memory then me

WOWOWOW
I decided to skip the z flip after watching all the reviews on you tube but I was blown away after I saw the actual phone in Samsung store.  I own it now :) I left my iPhone 11 Pro Max for it.   You need to try the z flip before making a decision.  Its a much better utilisation of your hard earned money Vs buying something like a note 20 ultra.  Hats off to Samsung !!!
So we ain&#39;t gonna talk about the sick way Marques started the video?
What about the backcover of the phone,,,,
Folding phone.... no thanks
Samsung is die hard to make people buy it, like every Korean celebrity use it and in every program or drama it is shamlessly used as product replacement like he get full shot in mid of a variety program, it it ugly thing to watch considering its price, it is expensive
It did pass the &#39;JerryRigEverything pebble test&#39; though..🙄
Apple really do be quiet about fold phones tho
zfleeep
Wow ILoved
Cost plss
I think it’s a great idea, and Samsung us always taking risks to innovate. I definitely see Improvements. Having flagship specs is impressive. Do I think it’s worth 1300? No!, thats the price tag for their notes but hey that’s on Samsung. Again they take risks and people will buy them. It’s pretty versatile so I can see this being used in other great ways like zoom meetings and just quick glances especially with the pill notch on the front cover. Overall I do see it being something great in the future and for sure a step forward on mobile phones.
nice try for samsung
I love this phone!
Open box excellent at best buy is under $1000 but I can&#39;t stomach the glasstic screen for that. <br><br>love the form factor
Is this better then the s20 ultra or no
I think it&#39;s cool but the crease will give me anxiety
Im gonna buy this one thx a lot bro💕💕💕inshallah
First comment with subscription, trying out!
For my business mobile phone, Love it!!
Price❓
After one month flip stop working.
I just got this phone from an iPhone 11 pro max and I regret it its not nearly as loud only gas one speaker the batter sucks and gets so dirty  ugh
Thank you for this. You answered my questions because I wanted to buy this phone.. I appreciate you saving me 2000 euro
Giant screen? Being a 6,7 inch display doesn&#39;t matter since it&#39;s 21:9 (the higher it is, the less meaning the inches have)
I thought the whole purpose of folding phones was to be able to fit a bigger phone into a smaller form factor not make a normal sized phone smaller.
Its not glass!! Do the scratch resistance
I don&#39;t like folding phones or Samsung or Android. Or anything other than Apple to be honest.
Damn I’m really into this one
small laptop
🤤 I want to have it, too.<br> LGvsSamsung=???
It looks so cute
Lol $1380  I better buy S20 and a good tablet
I feel like it&#39;s would be a good idea to buy these so Samsung would continue trying to make a better phone that folds
Great video
Always Samsung 🙏💟💟
This phone should be a $700 phone
Why does it flip in the first place?
People who has broken screens won’t have any problems using it🥺🥺🥺
Why battery mAh is so little? 3300 mAh :)
I will buy Galaxy Z Flip 2 when I get adult.
edit: you can dig your nail in it* screen is soft AF
prize?
Phone companies: we need to evolve phones.                          <br>Some guy : fLIp pH0nE$<br>Phone companies: GENIUS!!
How much is this phone
Waste of money and time
who the fuck would buy this
In the small screen you can make calls?
What ? Does the glass is not hard you can damage display with fingernail
Z flip is better than Razr
This looks like  gimmick
Can I use the PHONE without opening it? i.e. Can I answer calls, can I phone someone and talk with it closed?
Seems like a nice phone but, Why does it fold!?<br>Samsung: <i>Because WE CAN! Now give us money</i>
This is a nice  toy for kids, I am gonna buy this for my nephews
This is the perfect flip phone ever
Waiting apple&#39;s iPhold
Sorry bro but that’s definitely scratching at a level 3 with deeper grooves at a level 4
No headphone jack?? 😩
You can literally buy a fucking Iphone 11 pro max <br>Which is 10x better than this piece a shit for the same price
This is the cutest phone ever but the price ain&#39;t sadly
Samsung: Releases world first highly technical foldable phone<br>People: Meh.....It&#39;s overrated<br>Apple ( Year 3000) : Releases phone with no notch<br>People: Take my kidney 0_0
Of course you&#39;re gonna feel the crease, who expects a fold in a piece of glass to be smooth? 🤷🏽‍♂️
I don&#39;t mind it really,especially the size in pocket when closed.But the battery size was why i left the note 8 for the note 9,and i still haven&#39;t seen anything worth upgrading too.
Look like you hate Samsung :@
I am just worried about it.... You know what happened to Galaxy Fold...
I mean in terms of the folding screen I dont think it is worth 1k, I bet many of these brand phones could be made for a few £100 but as normal things are massively expensive, I mean how do they expect to grow 5g or even 6g even more if they are expecting common workers paying about £600 to £1k + just to use 5g network or and esim etc, even if all had 5g I bet they cap the speed or cap it when someone uses to much, unless they sort that bs out people might be sticking to fiber optics with no caps.
It seems like it would be opened and closed so much that it would break the hinge or and start squeaking etc, it is horrible seeing that crease to it is like a scratch.
waiting when it will go cheaper
I would break that yesterday
Het is een hele goede telefoon volgens mij ik zou hem zo kopen denk ik
The folding phone... solution to woman’s increasingly micro bags..
Imagine dropping it and needing repairs. You&#39;d have to dash to area 51 and bribe the fuckin aliens to help fix it lmao
Overpriced! I bet you that The production cost is max. 400$

Folding phones are really stupid
This guy needs to do videos like those  where guys build houses and pools in middle of the jungle, at least for a while. To raise his testosterone levels if not he will probably die because of the crease.
Anyway cut is a cut.
I searched this after seeing bts were advertising this phone
May be it&#39;s lifespan not better
Baddddd
I think the Z flip is the best for a dc emulator<br>I hope they fix it for double screen and play with<br>A controller
playing this at 0.5 is hilarious

At first I wanted this phone but at the price point I think I’ll stick with apple. It’s not worth the inconvenience of changing over tbh.. and if this is only the 2nd gen I might as well save my money and wait until apple comes out with something better down the track.
Nope! They definitely lost me with this phone. 👎🏽 I&#39;m better off getting an Oppo.
HONESTLY, why would someone buy this?
Although this looks absolutely beautiful to me and very fascinating, what is the point of a folding phone? Not hating, actually curious.
Again another clueless  reviewer. The lips are on the screen because IT CANNOT PHYSICALLY FOLD FLAT . Jeez and this guy has 10 million idiots following him.
In the 2020 people will make fun if someone had a flip phone but now all of a sudden everyone likes it
I WANT BLACKBERRY STYLE!
Watching videos because I will never be able to afford it😂😂
Wow, I hope he was just ignorant about it having a plastic screen (it&#39;s not actually glass). What an embarrassingly serious error. Sad to see how the content quality has gone down as the visual quality goes up on MKBHD.
Nice
I’m gonna wait until these phones cost around $800
Yeah it&#39;s a garbage idea.... End of ... :)
Me: thats some hightech<br>Gameboy SP mkbhd he got.
This looks so cool I can’t wait for apple to steal it
But then whats the purose of being foldable , it has no screen on back
Great to have this phone if you don’t want these new age huge ass phones in your pockets, bags, etc. For all you people don’t know that’s only thing this phone was made for. To use less space in your everyday life👍
I’ll get this in 2 years when I have a full time job that makes money
Any third party casing?
Markass brownie
This is actually awesome man
i can definitely not afford this but its just... so pretty... why did they have to make it so pretty im going to lose it...
I wish i could use this hinge in my door
No headphone jack...deal breaker!

Love it oml
How many time you can flip it before it brokes?
whether u like it or not, you gotta admit this would be damn cool to have!!
I think it&#39;s a really sick idea for sure!!
I find Microsoft&#39;s solution the best. Two separated non folding real and coated glass screens. Microsoft&#39;s designs so ergonomic and sweet. Forget about folding phones. They&#39;re gonna be pricey for a long time.

It reminds me of my very first mobile ph which is song errison. It flips and folds just like this one.
A phone that if you flip will transform into a phone. Whoa. Brilliant idea Samsung. Brilliant!<br><br>🤣🤣🤣
What is the point making these kind of phones?
It folds. You can&#39;t have a fold without a damn crease. It looks freaking amazing what more do you people want!
I think Steve Job would be embarrassed
If I get one...I’m going to call it ‘Ze Flip’
This is cool but why.. just why
ugly Galaxy Z
Let me just have that :&lt;
This will cost close to 6K Reais here in Brazil. Our minimum wage is 1K, so yeah, its pretty fucked up.<br><br>Thanks Bolsonaro

The Fold had that &quot;little extra&quot; on the outside with the exterior screen and the world criticized it, as they could not see it as extra but rather see it as a screen where you need to do all and hence it sucks. Now with the Z Flip the focus is reversed, now people wish for a bigger screen. I&#39;m quite sure had Samsung implemented a front screen covering the entire upper portion of the Z Flip, the discussion would have been again that you cannot do all on it and it&#39;s just not a good screen. Sigh.
Watching videos for the foldable phone is like me watching videos for playstation 5. I’m never gonna buy it because I’m a PC gamer. The phones look nice but come on I’m never switching to android.
Love to see that Greyduck shirt!
Oh wow Samsung made a Nintendo ds
The world has to a point where blacks, after suffering discrimination since centuries have started discriminating and making fun of others by stereotyping a poor’s word for the whole community from where he belongs. Its funny, how I know for the fact that in your country, no one is homeless and begging for money, everyone is billionaires. Is it so? Grow up kid. World can be a better place if we get away with hatred of all kind. Don’t understand what is hatred? Ask your forefathers.
Why that hideous shiny back? 🤮Looks cheap. ☹️<br>Why can’t Samsung go for matte finish?
I prefer flip phones.
I love it. Too expensive though.
lol i like how engineers pour thousands of hours coming up with new tech and marques just shits on it because it feels weird
You should be able to press a button on the side with your thumb. Then more screen slides out horizontally (cameras can slide up and down). And push the extra scrren in (or press the button) again when you don&#39;t want it.
Ugly phone.
한국의자랑
You always complain about screen ratio and black bar. I don&#39;t really understand why you shoot on 2:1. There&#39;s always black bar on any device I watch your video on. My xps 15, galaxy s10 plus, my qled 4k tv. SMH. I am not really sure where am I supposed to watch them on.
Nice Gameboy SP
rewind phone
I WANT this Z Flip.  It&#39;s everything to me! 💖 so far this will be my next device.
The battery is the bottleneck. The only reason I will consider buying any phone is if has a significant higher battery life : OS performance ratio.
they need A flip button like the Motorola Nextel i860 🤙
Damn, the 90&#39;s and 00&#39;s were so good, they bring back everything from that Era.
seriously tho.. why?
Its not glass ... Its plastic check out &quot;jerry rig everything&quot; for more details
Stop calling it a glass display. Its glass particles fused in plastic so its plastic with glass particles fused inside.
It&#39;s like a tiny laptop, like.. the same size with the new MacBook pro

The only problem with these &quot;folding&quot; phones is that the folding does not bring any special feature to the phone, it really serves no real use or value except being able to say it folds...
Are you sure you can’t dig your fingernails into it lol
“constantly...K-onstantly”
i really don&#39;t get it
I want this phone NOW!
Seems u guys forgot those day u keep having cord problems....smh y u want ur phone folded
inb4 people selling tons of cracked C Flips on craigslist within 1 month
Sorry but that’s not glass it’s plastic. Stop saying that is glass because it’s not. Take it to a lab and do the tests. You’ll see. It’s just plastic
Mesmerised  at the way you opened  the video ...
Nice
junk
So no tempered glass then I presume
&quot;Scratches at a level 2 with deeper grooves at a level 3&quot;

I appreciate how bold this design is, but you definitely pay one heck of a steep price for convenience.
Guys you don’t need to say thank you to Koreans. We know that we are the smartest people ever
ok my question is how many folds can that glass take before it tears
I really wish Motorola had released an updated Razr but still as a flip phone, not smartphone
This is just a passing gimmick to me… I still have my S8 and while I really like it, I was over the curved screen reeeal quick🙄 and I also don&#39;t want to upgrade because of the missing headphone jack, ever increasing prices, ugly notches or cameras directly on the screen (instead of being hidden in the bezel) and not being able to use my own memory card to force me to buy a higher gb phone.
It looks like a woman&#39;s make up case. That&#39;s a hard pass for me haha.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=115">1:55</a> yes, you can. JerryRigEverything proves it! The glass is under the permanent plastic layer
with the crease how do u think the phone will stay together u are just being picky and just get on with it
MKBHD it&#39;s glass.<br>JerryRigEverything it&#39;s not glass!!
I just want a smartphone with a pen in it.
Anyone here know that some hindus( a religion in india) do not eat non-vegetarian food ,they do not eat the food like chicken and all that because they have a feeling for animals .They even dont eat eggs, all hindus are not pure vegetarian, but India is the most vegetarian populated country

Please Review The Moto G7 Or Moto G7 Power.

I feel like the price is to insight quality because it&#39;s not worth that. The price is going to drop drastically just like any other phone. I say wait another gen, but that flip style viewer for video calls etc looks useful.
My OCD can&#39;t deal with that crease
Watch jerryrigeverything’s video. It’s not glass
I&#39;vote 👍samsung flip samsung is kingdoom of smartphons 💎💎💎
again, if you know better, make something better! you are a youtuber, what did you invent!?
This whole concept of a folding phone is easily one of the dumbest things Ive seen. The old Apple scroll idea like 8 years ago would be a lot more logical than this.
It&#39;s literally plastic. Has been tested in other channels, you can mark it with your fingernails.

I am an Arabic content creator interested in Taklongpa. I need your support to continue the channel
I&#39;d rather find a payphone and wait in line at a post office to communicate than pay $1300 for a phone that brings not much more than the ability to flip the screen.
Back to the drawing board, flip phones are in
Looks awesome!!!
Wondering how long this gimick is going to last. Seems like Samsung only sells phone because they are gimmicky. This will break, by the hinge/glass or it&#39;ll catch fire.
It looks cool but I don’t think I’d get one. Maybe in the future after more improvements. I definitely like the idea of a folding tablet.
Dope!
Why did no one review the Huawei mate x??
People: &quot;Apple is so greedy. I am sure no other smartphone company will ever be this greedy!&quot;<br>Samsung: * Hold my foldphone *
Stop reviewing only high end stuff.
It is plastic and you can dig your nails in though, you should watch Jerry rig everything’s video
10 years later apple will launch a foldable phone and call it innovation
Amazing video you really inspired me to start my channel would you mind taking a look and maybe subbing??
Wouldn&#39;t It break quicktly?
남자는 핑크지..ㄷㄷㄷ
This video aged like milk. Calling the screen glass when Jerryrigeverything just exposed it as plastic. And don&#39;t defend it as having &#39;a thin layer of glass&#39; in it. No even if there was a thin layer of glass underneath the plastic then Marquess and all other users are still touching and interacting with the useless plastic that can be scratched by a fingernail not the glass. Samsung marketing is a scam.
It&#39;s a bit of a gimik tbh. Just go and get a one plus 7 pro for half the price like I did a few months back.
नमस्ते.. आप अच्छे वीडियो बनाते हो। मेरे तरफ से आपको बोहोत सुभकमनाए।<br>Namaste.. You make wonderful videos. I wish you best of luck.
Things are becoming more and more expensive. <br><br>No wonder the richest stand today at $100+ billions when couple years ago they were struggling to cross $50 billion
Your reviews are too intense and nit-picking. I mean it&#39;s just a phone at the end of the day you either like it or not. I think it&#39;s quite a cool phone and Samsung are trying to change the &quot;boring phone era&quot; we entered since 2015 by creating new styles.
The charging &#39;jack&#39; can also be placed with a headphone or earphone if you have its connector just like my galaxy tab5e
This is real innovation from Samsung! Take notes Apple
it screen isnt a glass u will get to know if u watch jerryrigeverything its useless
Waiting for xiaomi to launch one.
All I see is a shinier Gameboy Advanced SP...
Big issue is the crease a problem ?
MKBHD: its an ultra thin glass screen. You cant dig your finger in!.<br>JERRYrigeverything: YES!
Are you still using the one plus mclaren edition I&#39;m thinking about getting that or the note ten plus pr maybe waiting.for the s20 or one plus 8 pro but I really lile the McLaren edition the screen the look the case etc
People who make these phones are running out of ideas for a normal phone. Who the fuck need this?
Prefer my old dumb phone that can never ever be hacked. Or tracked. And only cost me $10 per month with Rogers. Can&#39;t stand rinky dink little screens - give me my 12&quot; tablet anytime. And a real camera (Nikon D810) for pictures.
2k trash. There&#39;s a report, they&#39;re already broken.

The phone nobody asked for and a price nobody would pay for.
With summer coming I gotta say that I’ve this idea, because in warmer weather I will be shedding winter coats with big pockets and moving towards putting a phone in my small pant pocket. A small phone that fits nicely in my pocket is a very welcome change as phones seem to be getting bigger and bigger. I will be buying this when it is launched. Thanks, 😁
Its not glass
Boring same tech: Smartphone manufacturing is not even revolutionary anymore: wake me up when the mechanical battery technology is practical to mobile phones.
when pretending put a makeup on  but actually taking a stolenshot to your crush 😂😂 really good idea🤔
that folding phone is good. I hate having massive phone on my pocket so. would love to watch more reviews before buying . kinda expensive tbh lol
But what&#39;s the point of this.
Does glass fold?
I&#39;ll be glad when you started making phones with clear color backs see what inside
What&#39;s the point of folding phones that still need to unfold it when we used it? Is it really necessary to fold a phone? It&#39;s still better to use regular phones with no extra effort to fold or unfold everytime we pull it out from our pocket. Just my opinion.. 😆
Im here cause that Jerry burn

Back in the day flip phones were cool, but today...? Nope, not gonna waste my money on that.
bezel on bezel gachiBASS
Ok but why, why do you need a flip smartphone
The splash screen seemed to hint at the potential creation of the MKBHD app? 🤔
DO NOT BUY THESE PHONES FROM SAMSUNG!!!!! They DO NOT under any circumstances take responsibility on any agreement with foldable phones. Any issues you will pay out of pocket for. They have all kinds of little clauses to get around having to take responsibility( just a quick ex is u can&#39;t carry the phone in ur pocket WTF) Dont buy it go with another company. The design sucks anyway with that stupid little front window
&quot;It&#39;s a glass&quot;....oh c&#39;mon fuck off. Its freakin&#39; plastic shit where even the damn finger nails dug it up.

Just got an Xperia 1 mint condition from CEX in UK with 2 year warranty on EE for £330. <br><br>Flagship specs, Incredible 21:9 AMOLED 4K HDR screen which is overkill for movies and gaming.<br><br>Fits in my pocket with ease and no stupid crease in the middle of the screen.<br><br>Saved £1k on a novelty feature that ruins the overall look of the display lol.
I think that it is impressive overall, but at the minute i would not bother with a folding phone, it feels a little gimmick at the minute and not really polished enough to be asking that sort of money for something which, in reality, is still a concept.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=113">1:53</a> ask jerry, def. No glass
This makes me want an Android 😢
The screen didn&#39;t survive 1wk.<br>The Z flaw
I like this more than the fold, but ide like to see better cameras &amp; a better front display. If I was to upgrade it would be to the s20ultra 😎
Doc Disrespect will love this flip phone lol
it looks like a modernized gameboy advanced sp
ew
You can feel that right away its not platic its glass....<br><br>Meanwhile the screen gets scratched and damaged by fingernails... This does not happen to glass so stop calling it glass its made up by harder plastic.<br><br>You dorks need to stop it its plastic
&quot;Its not a soft plastic that you can literally dig your nails into&quot;<br><br>Well that didn&#39;t even get a <b>chance</b> to age badly.
The screen doesnt appear to be glass, thumbnails leave big grooves in it according to JRE.
The crease complaints will soon become as irrelevant/ignored as complaints about alleged shortcomings as &quot;fingerprint magnet&quot;; &quot;hard to operate with just one hand&quot;; &quot;distracting punch hole/notch&quot;; &quot;no audio jack&quot;; &quot;not a premium feel/build&quot; etc.
It&#39;s not glass. It&#39;s plastic mixed with glass particles.
nah..u still can leave a mark using finger nails..
JerryRigEverything has stronger fingernails I guess... Increase the Omega6 intake, Marques :)))
Imagine copying the other flip phones-
Folding glass is a major necessary development.
I still don’t understand the appeal of a folding phone.<br><br>🤷‍♂️
Nonsense tech
I love the idea of the flip phone. Hopefully the price will come down. Can you see caller ID when the phone is closed?
Jerry rig!!!
I think you&#39;re asking for too much. It&#39;s a folding phone with flagship specs, u also want a creaseless fold and a second screen... do u know how expensive that&#39;s gonna be
Mon i want to buy a flip phone<br>Oh more cheeper than iPhone i will <br>Yes when u on the way home can u buy for me? Name is Samsung Galaxy Z
I think JerryRigEverything would beg to differ about the screen!
Looks like a great new waste of money. What’s next? Back to small phones? Back to buttons? So many suckers itching to pay big for recycled tech style.
Except you CAN dig your fingernails in outher layer of screen made of plastic.
This is very impressive, can only wait to see what apple does if they do a folding phone
Hmmmm why on some people says it’s plastic type.!???
It has a glass, But just cover with plastic for protection. Search for Pbk reviews
Nice intro<br>The Samsung Z Flip Ad directly at the start
It isn&#39;t glass!
Shoutout to my YouTube channel please I am your biggest fan !!!<br>Channel name : Pure Genius
Y’all should watch jerryrigeverything ‘s video
Oh no! Samsung is going back into the past and starting to make old 1996 flip phones!
IT’S NOT GLASS!!!
You have a literal folding smart phone, STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT A DAMN CREASE IN THE DISPLAY!!! If you dont want a crease then just buy a normal phone FFS!
A bald guy with an Adidas cap was heard shouting &quot;This phone bends...!
&quot;leave a thumbs up if you wanna see x&quot; I lol&#39;d
Eat your cereal
I&#39;m a Korean and I&#39;m so proud of Samsung which is my country&#39;s company. But why do we need to fold the phone? Current smart phones&#39;s design was made because folding phone is uncomfortable. Why is Samsung moving backward?
How much it&#39;s that z flip
fanboy ..great content....
Phone prices are crazy.  Technology usually results in cheaper products but this has not happened with phones yet.  Corporate greed is to blame, corporations can manufacture the same phones and sell them for a way lower price, but they are sadly plagued by greed instead of putting the customer first.  This will not last, competition will ultimately prevail and result in a slashing of phone prices, and those companies that do not will lose customer share and not survive.  Apple was the pioneer company for the smartphone, but now that the competition has caught up there will be tremendous pressure on Apple to slash prices, and I mean slash not cut, either that or be left out.  Customers have no patience for corporate greed.
so y’all wanna go back to flip phones?💀😂
How come you never review Sony phones? Would like to see how the Xperia 5 compares to Samsung/Apple/etc.
Epic fail! 👎🏻
Can you do one on the z flip please ?
I thought the folding phone on the thumbnail was photoshopped but reality hit me like a truck. Ouch...
Better but still not there.
That crease is an eyesore for a $1k phone. Besides, folding a phone only adds bulk in yur pockets, doesnt save any dam space.
Not really glass though
Review the Escobar fold 2
No jack for a headset? Forget it. (I hate wireless headsets).
Why 2020 is shitty phone year , nothing is impressive .
Mate can you please review the Escobar Fold 2, And not order it in your name so they don&#39;t know your gonna review it, I&#39;m very close to buying it and I need to see your take on it or if you will even receive it.
What&#39;s the whole point of a folding phone? Samsung stock is about to take a tumble next quarter or 2.
Soooo you saying after all these years we went back to the flip phone
It is okayish but Samsung telling 200k lid closes is all it supports would maybe hold for like 2 or 3 years. And people who are more often opening and closening their device will reach EOL even earlier.
I think samsung did an amazing job on this one. They did better. So much better to the point where I&#39;d buy

God i fucking love how your videos fills my screen
It’s glass but it’s actually quite pliable compared to what most have come to expect from Glass especially when talking about a phone. Zack has a video showing how weak the “glass” is. I haven’t had my hands on the phone so I’ll reserve my questions on the feel.
Jerry rigs everything would disagree!! He scratched the screen with his fingernail. The screen is plastic.
Can you add subtitles in Turkish?
It&#39;s not a glass 🙄
No folks, them blokes had diamond fingernails. The Zflip, with a true transparent screen.just don&#39;t try clean anything off it with your fingernails..Boom...like Brexit all over again..
The crease is still less intrusive than the selfie camera 🤷
U can&#39;t dig your fingernails into this screen.<br>This statement clearly aged poorly .<br>Plastic is plastic and plastic can be digged with fingernails .
It&#39;s actually plastic. And you can dig your finger nails in it.
glass doesn&#39;t bend
It&#39;s great how a lot of these YouTubers are taking Samsung on their word that the screen is glass. Whereas jerryrigeverything just went to town on the phone and proved that it&#39;s plastic that can be damaged by your nail.
You can actually dig into it with your finger nail. Jerryrig everything proved that. And calling it glass is not correct.
No one wants a fucking flip phone though.  Been there done that. The chapter of my life thats in the past now
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=113">1:53</a> its not glass its plastic.
This is not a real glass..
It feels ridiculous to me while engineers spent their life and used their great intelligence to develop miraculous material, the glass that can be actually folded and not be broken, so called influencer jibber jabber about how crease feels... I hope they know the meaning of the technology and have respect for it if they are &#39;tech&#39; reviewer
I like this i think i can get use to the fold
&quot;It&#39;s not a soft plastic that you can literally dig your fingernails into&quot; <br>lol<br>JerryRigEverything literally scratched the screen with his fingernails. Is Marques just reading scripts from Samsung or did he honestly reviewed the device ?
&quot;Glass&quot;
The screen is not glass, please watch JerryRigEverything . Samsung lied.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=116">1:56</a> JerryRigEverything kind of embarrassed you
Could u please do a video on which is better, Samsung or Apple
But it&#39;s not glass and you CAN dig your fingernails into it. JerryRigEverything proved that.
No disrespect to your vid bit who’s dumb idea was it to bring back a flip phone
it has plastic screen you can leave nail impression on the screen i have check it out !
Nintendo DS
the screen is nowhere near glass. scratches as easily as expected from plastic. don&#39;t believe all the marketing wank
Am I the only one who noticed he is a stranger things fan
He can get copyrighted for fake stranger things shirt😅
&quot;it&#39;s glass&quot;  offscreen; checks bank account to see if Samsung already wired the 5k :p
i am very disturbed and concern about that phone. it doesn&#39;t sit right with me.
Jerry nailed the screen like literally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=112">1:52</a>
genuinely excited to see what Apple comes up with in this space... in several years. From switching back and forth a couple times I ended up sticking with Apple, but this Z Fold is super tempting. I’m glad to see the price for this tech coming down.
Jerryrigeverything says different. And I believe him.
What&#39;s next? A phone with a rotary dial 🙄
This phone is really cool, but I&#39;m just going to stick with my Galaxy s10.
If only people cared about politics as much as a new phone....and we wonder why our government is crap.
Specs: not to impressed tbh. Was hoping at least a triple camera setup. At least for that price. <br><br>But overall seems to be something to build upon these coming years
umm...that&#39;s not glass...
Bro the tempature is 66 out side on he&#39;s Z Flip DID YOU YALL Realise what i did
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=117">1:57</a> I don’t know MKHB if you haven’t seen Jerry Rig Everything video but the screen is plastic and can been scratched by your finger nail
Am I tweaking or is that Tik Tok Application at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=55">0:55</a> ?
I hated laptop hinges...broke countless...and im def. not getting this phone! Why just why is this a thing?
Anybody else watch so many reviews but not gonna buy the phone? 😂
This phone looks like a modern gameboy advanced lol
Galaxy flop for gen Z people who haz to much money...
The front glas is not glas samsung lied its still plastic
Just watched another video where the guy clearly shows that the screen is NOT glass!
Its a plastic screen...not glass.
just Plastic not a class bro Use your finger nail 😂
The material choice is so awful. Pure fingerprint magnet.
This is not glass, watch the video from jerryrigs
On another episode How Can We Sell Things To Vain Idiots...
Stoopid. Looks cool but that&#39;s about it. The Razr will forever be the only flip phone I&#39;ll want and never had 😥
It’s time to make a correction.. you can literally dig your fingernails on the screen.
Just get a fucking flip phone ffs lmao! Truly nothing new under the sun except for prolly Elon Musk.
I&#39;ll stick to my Ultra
Its not glass its a plastic screen just watch a video that proves it.  Not worth over a £1000
No need for this garbage. Remove the shit.
Marques Brownlee: The screen is glass<br><br>JerryRigEverything: The screen is not glass
Lol the z flip isnt a glass screen go look at Jerry rig everything&#39;s video on it
Honestly, what&#39;s the point in talking about phone specs and speed anymore since they&#39;re all still slowing down phones with software updates whenever it suits them. The specs are &#39;it just came out&#39; and that&#39;s the full story.
I love it!
The screen is plastic, it get burned, you can scratch it with fingernails and it won&#39;t brake like glass
Marques: it&#39;s not a soft plastic that you can dig your finger nails into<br>Jerryrigeverything: hold my bruised thumb
The screen is plastic. What are you going on about?
Have you seen the lg g8x thin would be cool if you made a video comparing it to these phones :)
2030: Trade in you cell phone for 20 cents off of our new $2000 corded phone. <br><br>Free year of dial up bonus with 4 year overpriced contract. <br><br>New customers only.<br><br>Fuck our current customers.
I was excited about the screen when they said it was glass. Then I watched Jerry’s video and he scratched it at a level 2 with deeper groves at a level 3. And then his finger nail. Thus I was disappointed
Go watch Jerry&#39;s video you will see it&#39;s not glass( not offending Samsung I love the phone
Fake glass
phone is trash!!!!!!
Why would anyone want to fold their mobile?
Have you heard what JerryRigEverything said about the &quot;glass&quot; not being glass ?
2030:walkman
Marques... Zach from Jerryrigeverything tested the screen and its plastic
Wait... I thought you could use the outside screen?
It’s not a plastic you can literally dig your fingernails into...<br>JRE: literally digs his nail into plastic screen.
I&#39;ve seen a video that the so called glass is bullshit it&#39;s very fragile and he scratched it with his nail.
I don’t want an iPad in my pocket I literally just want a phone in my pocket that I can make smaller
That moment when the screen isn’t actually glass -came from JerryRigEverything’s video
Not glass!!!!
That ain&#39;t glass...
Just start putting bigger pockets in women&#39;s pants and pockets in leggings and we won&#39;t need all this..
Love that plastic screen...
So glad flips are making a comeback! I’d also like to see the sidekick-style phone make a comeback. I had the original Razr instead of the Sidekick and always through the sidekick was so much cooler. I’d love to see them compete again.
I feel like a flip phone like this is almost pointless these days when we are so used to the larger form factor of a smartphone anyway...well, many of us are. <br>This tech I think will be more interesting for having a tablet that folds to a phone size. Being able to carry a tablet in your pocket that folds to current smartphone size I think is basically the best use of this idea.
The screen is plastic. Samsung lied. It&#39;s like how the realme has a plastic back that feels like glass.
Dad! Look! That man has a Gameboy SP!!!
No, the screen is not hard, watch jerryrigeverything’s video
Samsung: WE FOLDED GLASS <br><br>Jerryrigeverthing: <b>I&#39;M GOING TO END THIS GADGETS WHOLE CARRIER</b>
Not glass, but like the idea.
The screen is plastic not glass<br><br>I know this is just a “first impressions” video, not a full review, but I know that plastic can be made very thin and very smooth to the point where it feels like glass...but that screen ain’t glass, it’s plastic
Me, who used a flip phone for a couple months because I actually really liked it and everyone used to joke that it was a drug dealer phone: Well. Look who’s ahead of the trends lol.
The screen is <b>not</b> made from Glass. Jerryrigeverything proved this.
2: 01 It&#39;s glass<br>JerryRigEverything: Hold My Finger Nails
phone: folded<br>Phone case manufacturer: <b>ANGER</b>
I definitely understand a horizontal flip so you can have a big screen, but why would you want to fold a normal sized screen <b>in half</b>
&quot;Its glass&quot;...   Jerry scratches the Display with his Fingernails <br><br>Scratches at 2 deeper groves at 3.....dont lie dude
I hate new phones with no headphone jack :&#39;(
thats not glassss
I wonder if this guy saw Jerry rig this phone and prove your finger nails will leave a mark on that plastic screen
2020: Flip Phone Generation 2
Bad idea the design
Real glass you say... wait until Jerryrigeverything gets a hold of it
FLIP PHONES ARE SO SASSY!!
I want that phone
This phone doesn&#39;t do anything to get technology going forward. Just like Samsung&#39;s 3D TVs/and Curved TV..it&#39;s just a phone for teens, all bells and whistles..no actual breaking new ground.
Ew
&quot;If glass isn&#39;t glass then truth doesn&#39;t matter but the truth does matter&quot; <br>      - JERRYRIGEVERYTHING
I hate this whole folding-smartphone era of technology.<br>I just look at it and keep thinking of the future of smartphones. I really don’t want us ending up having phone that folds 20 times and how hard it will be to handle it. I’m sticking with my basic smartphone.
I saw a video that it&#39;s noy real glass. Even the man did put his fingernails in it and you could saw the dammage.
I think you need to watch Jerry rig everything. It&#39;s not glass and you can mark it with your fingernail....
It scratched at a level 3 its plastic
I&#39;m not sure about this catching on the phone trend but this would be awesome as a handheld gaming device! 👍🏾
THIS SCREEN IS NOT MADE OF QUARTS, FUSED-SILICA!! You can call it glass, but people should understand that it&#39;s more like a plexiglass which is just a transparent plastic.
Why don’t u go invent a phone
is it for stupids who found out that the classic flip phones were better than the 1984spybigbrothernasty AKA &quot;smart&quot; phones, and think they&#39;re less intrusive just because the newest ones fold again?  Buddy, you&#39;re still being surveilled by psycho creeps in government and hackers, still being listened to and watched by csis kgb cia fbi and commies too.
Marqass Brownie
What&#39;s up with these stupid companies not putting a headphone jack in their phone? It&#39;s literally the dumbest thing
That screen may be called glass but it’s not glass. False advertising.
It&#39;s not glass. Jerry rig everything
Get over the fucking crease
Sad.. its not really glass. I just watched the durability test by Jerryridgeeverything
It&#39;s not glass BTW that&#39;s a lie. You can cut into it with your finger nail.
btw its not glass, you can damage the screen with your fingernail.
Glass you say.....did I mention this video auto played after JRE&#39;s durability test of this phone.....TLDR...not glass.
Jerryrigeverything proove that&#39;s not glass.....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=295">4:55</a> -&gt; it passed the test
I really hate having to flip and unflip my device....not into flips period!
&quot;It&#39;s not a soft plastic that you can literally dig your fingernails into&quot; <br>that didn&#39;t age 5 days
Amazing how they made glass as durable as plastic ... I hoped it is glass that doesn’t scratch with a fingernail but it looks like that was wrong. It may be what they call glass but it’s still scratches at lvl 2 with deeper grooves at lvl 3.thanks but no thanks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=116">1:56</a> this didn’t age well after Zach’s durability video. Marques a poor victim of Samsung’s hype and deception.
i recommend to dig your fingernail into it ,its not glass.......
XD the &quot;JerryRigEverything throw a bunch of pebbles on the phone&quot; test
2007: WE HATE FOLD PHONES WE HATE FOLD PHONES <br>2020: PRAISE THE FOLD PHONES WE LOVE FOLD PHONES!!!!!
The screen is very cheep plastic that fingernails can ruin easily
So hot garbage. Got it.
How many phones does this guy have
liar
After watching jerryrigeverything video:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=100">1:40</a><br>🤦‍♂️
Who&#39;s here again after Jerry&#39;s video 😂
According to Jerry rig everything this phone is not really glass and actually still quite soft
It’s like the iPhone 6 Plus except it still works when you bend it 🤯
The best! So so so nice rewiev👌✌👍👍👍👍
Jerry doing the real work
“You can feel the crease of the fold...” - These are our first world problems 😂🙈
Why do people complain so much about the crease? Big deal, like can&#39;t you just appreciate how incredible it is that the foldable phones we dreamed of in the past have now become a reality, or simply the ingenuity behind this device.
That screen is not glass, watch jerryrig ;)
The Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro????? when
That screen ain&#39;t actually glass.  Go watch Jerry&#39;s video
it&#39;s not glass. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=108">1:48</a>
Jerryrigeverthing damaged  the screen with his nail, regardless as always great review.
its not glass go watch jerry rigs durability test
So a flip phone?
The galaxy z flip &quot;ultra-thin glass&quot; is not glass. Its 100% plastic
Lmao. &quot;If glass isnt glass, the thr truth doesnt matter, and the truth should matter.  This isn&#39;t American politics. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Watch jerryrig. Samsung false advertised the screen being ultra thin glass. It&#39;s just plastic like the fold. Lmao. Hahaha.
So, not glass.
Jerry Rig destroyed the “thin glass” gimmick.
inner screen made from plastic
it IS plastic, it is NOT glass, you CAN dig your fingernails into it
It is not glass.  It has more of plastic properties
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=115">1:55</a> &quot;it&#39;s not a plastic you can dig your fingernails into&quot;<br>Jerryrigeverything: hol&#39; up
deeper grooves at level 3......ITS NOT GLASS!!!!
Jez I gotta say Samsung really leading the market not a Apple follower anymore
Folding phones are really just quirck phones the future relies either on smart glass tech or hologram tech, folding phone is not really an advancement its really going backward in technology. A folding phone is just Samsungs way of selling you some garbage technology to make profits it&#39;s really not something cool that I would buy... anyways that&#39;s just my opinion, feel free to agree or disagree.
So since it’s not glass are you just full of it?
Dislike, because of THE GLASS!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=112">1:52</a> I don’t know what do you feel, but watch JerryRigsEverything’s video
It isn’t glass btw check out jerryrigeverything for the more info
1st 5 Subscribers to my channel will receive a sub from me 3 likes and comments on your video!!! Lets get this going
Watch jerryrigeverything <br>The screen is plastic<br>Am confused now
Still like the RAZR better, the Z flip looks like a regular phone broken in two but not broken. I could do with a cheaper foldable but don&#39;t need top specs. And that tiny outside screen is a joke, might as well put notification led.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=108">1:48</a><br>The screen is NOT glass !!!<br>It&#39;s plastic with 0 resistance to scratches.<br>Samsung lied to everyone.<br>Please stop spreading false information.<br>Jerry already proved that is plastic!!!
Still not sure about the whole folding a HD screen thing 😬 It hurts watching it fold. That crease. Cool but it&#39;s a no for me ✌️
Gameboy advance sp vibes
Glass not plastic go check Jerry&#39;s video and than say anything More
Liar! The screen is shitty plastic nothing else!
Game boy advance sp
i like it though, it&#39;s just not GLASS.
how about the foldable cases?
Jerry rig everything just did the Galaxy flip z video and he showed the screen is in fact plastic. Please let the people know that the screen will scratch very easily.
So basically it&#39;s a pimped up Nintendo DSi? I can live with that
It’s not glass
The screen is plastic
Is it true that the screen made of plastic not glass!?
It’s not glass even though they call it. It has more plastic properties. <br>Bad move samsung. Should not sell people telling that the screen is glass.
Samsung: We made a ultra thin folding “glass”.<br>JerryRigEverything: I’m about to end this man’s whole career!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=114">1:54</a> yikes...  ya sure?
It’s already been proven the screen is plastic and not glass. You didn’t honestly thing they could make ‘glass’ fold did you?
爷终于上油管了！
Jary discovered  it is not glass
Folding device is only useful when the display can expand beyond what we have already i.e. 6&quot; on average. If we are making it 3&quot; that doesn&#39;t actually feed the consumers. But appreciable effort by Samsung.
The screen aint glass, its plastic, go watch jerryrig&#39;s video
@MKBHD,the screen is made of plastic and not glass as advertised by Samsung..Check JERRYRIG EVERYTHING video on the Z Flip..<br>You wil be abrested
It can&#39;t be glass no matter how thin it is. My thought though.
Great phone for people who do proper construction work, or play ultimate frisbee.
Its not glass..
Kind of phone you don’t buy first revision.
except you can dig your finger nails into it...
crease: well the damn think folds like a book, in is foldable so you get a crease
but u can literally dig your fingernails into the &quot;glass&quot;.
Scratches from fingernails with dead pixels on level 5.
Nah man its plastic not glass.
Looks like make up set<br>Which is  good for women
history is damned to be repeated
But it&#39;s not really glass, it&#39;s still a plastic screen.
Jerryrigeverything just debunked the glass thing.
I mean I&#39;m already laughing now, but in 10-20 years we&#39;ll all be laughing at this bullshit called folding phones they tried to sell us for $1000+..
This phone reminds me of the GBA SP
Nokia Users: whats the difference??<br>(1year later)<br>Apple:BRAND NEW IFLIP THE BIGEST INOVATION IN PHONE TECHNOLOGY
My first thought: Gameboy Advance ?
garbage
I love Samsung but $1500 for a Ds is to much
Waste of money... still waiting for Surface Due!
What&#39;s the point of the Razr if it&#39;s uniqueness is being passed around?
How are you doing Marques? I hope all is very well.
I&#39;m going to upgrade to the S20+ I need the bigger screen. The plus phones also play nicer with their Gear VR.
That pink is horrid
Motorola: <b>*cries in background*</b>
Step 1: Create a need<br><br>Step 2: Satisfy it<br><br>Basic principle of marketing
A question: so the glass bends? Wtf
Probably vibranium might sort the screen issue.🙂
Why do u need a flip phone now for real
it&#39;s an unfinished product
👍💎
Flat and bezel-less is the end-game as far as form factor innovation goes. until some new, groundbreaking display tech makes its way into the phone world, we&#39;re up for a long string of pointless gimmicky feature innovations like this.
We all know where those phones will break... Material fatigue is a thing. Enjoy .
Samsung Z flip: 1400€<br>Apple:&quot;Hold my beer&quot;<br>            iFlip 2000€
Mark ass
i don´t get why i should buy a folding phone??? I mean its a cool and funny thing but i just don´t see any positive things
If it were Apple, you’d be dripping
Hinges are extremely important for foldable phones...Come on Marquee I think I could have not figured out if u wouldn&#39;t have said it :p
People need to stop whining about the crease in the screen....it&#39;ll always be there. it&#39;s folding on it so you have to expect it. Personally, I&#39;m over all the bells and whistles, I think I just want a turn of the century style flip with no apps  - just basic calandar, email, SMS and phone book functions...oh and a removable battery so I can go OTG if I wish.
It&#39;s a gimmick.. And only thin what is nice that it is smaller... nothing more
I would buy this
Is this video taken in your home??

It gives me anxiety.

Foldable on mobile phones are really stupid idea.
Just switched to Samsung, I love it
Why do you always want a perfect device  that is manufactured according to you. It’s getting annoying!
Absolutely useless phone. Near future must be like Huawei Mate X.
Let&#39;s be honest why would you need a flip phone!?!
the crease is just fine Marques.
This is why android is awesome. Its the android manufacturers pushing the boat out on tech and design. Unfortunately, it needs apple to release a flip phone for suddenly everyone to go yeah need a flip phone 🙄

cool!
I don&#39;t think the crease will be a issue for me; I often use the bottom half of the screen when scrolling.
Okay, how about stop spending money making pointless changes to technology we don&#39;t actually need to progress. <br><br>Could have been much more worthwhile in the medial industry.
When he said there is no headphone jack, I lost my shit because I fuckin love music and I hate listening to music on the go without headphones. The no headphone jack thing is a huge design flaw.
The first i was thinking about was gameboy. Idk why
That shit looks like a motha fuckin gameboy advance. I would never buy that shit. 😂🤣
And they say history repeats itself.
Unless you wear tight Butt crack visible jeans,these phones actually serve no purpose.
That display is not 1 inch. It’s maybe 0,2. 1 inch would be the size of an applewatch display.
You can wear it on your wrist as a watch too..sure there will be accessories for this ..😁
U use bolster ? 🤣
I would get it .. but if Apple made it
I can&#39;t believe people are just buying and destroying them for videoes. Give me one
Guys trust me... I bought this phone and it looks amazing.....dont trust this guy...he&#39;s an Apple fan boy
This thing just make me more excited for the inevitable Fold Note. Kudos to Samsung for pushing the bar and testing the market&#39;s boundaries!
We need a real revolutionary to come up with new ideas.
Jerryrigeverything: &quot;Ouh new toy!!&quot;
I&#39;m pretty sure Marques has the OP 8pro with him now.....
Her is getting real!
Yea I&#39;m gonna stick to flipless phones. This is a weird fad. Why would I want to have to open and close a phone all the time?
Great video! I actually like both the Z Flip and the Razr.
how a glass can be folded? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=107">1:47</a>
People are missing the Point with this Phone. It&#39;s Samsung destroying Motorola so Samsung can stay THE top name
<b>thicc pebbles</b>
Let&#39;s do a reverse bend test 270 to 360 .. ufff tak takkk
Stupid idea, people do&#39;t put their phone down long enough to fold it anyway, it&#39;s always in use
Do the &#39;Razor v Z Flip&#39; video!
BUT I WONDER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FOLD THIS PHONE ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES.... HOW&#39;S THE CREASE LOOK THEN.
My laptop has 8Gb  Ram 😥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=231">3:51</a> unfold the phone, why not just say open?
Why? My phone already fits in my pocket. There’s no reason to use this...
855 isn&#39;t flagship.  865 is.  Minor point but c&#39;mon
RIP - Tempered Glass Screen Protectors
This looks better than fold
battery is so fucken small
With no headphone jack!!!I&#39;m out.
Real question: but why???
What about games
samsung is great
Yo what up Mark Ass Brown Lee
People in 2001:After 19 years we&#39;ll create a hologram phone<br><br><br>Samsung: Brand new fold phone
gonna wait... im sure apple is working on it too xD
Gameboy advance sp vibes lol
$1400... at that price, it better make us coffee
Shoul be x flip
It&#39;s a pretty nice improvement from the horrendous Galaxy Fold. But still a long way to go. Either way, I&#39;m sticking with the iPhone lol...love this impressions vid  though.
Folding phones: a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist 🤔
so it doesn&#39;t need casing?
Instead of bending and creasing screens. They should finally remove the camera punch hole and put camera under the screen. No one is longer impressed that type of mobile phones as the patents for flip phones died ages ago.
u can feel the crease?<br><br>I dont really swipe that high
How do you get a case for this phone
엠흑새끼가 리뷰도 하노!
Looks good to me
My main question is “WHY”<br>What does this gimmick add to the actual device, aside from just being... a gimmick? It’s way weaker, one wrong bend and you’ll snap that thing in half. Eventually that crease is gonna get worse and worse over time. Sure it may save some space in your pocket, but who even keeps other things in the same pocket as their phone? It can’t be more comfortable, I have an iphone Xs and I never even notice it in my pocket. I find this really pointless and stupid.
Fold phones are good in the past. This is just a ridiculous trend. Improve what already works instead of creating a Frankenstein phone
Samsung: Unveils ultra secret Galaxy XYZ<br><br>MKBHD: So, I&#39;ve been using the Galaxy XYZ for a month now...
lol this is legit Iphone 7+ &amp; 8+ camera
...I don’t really see the point of these vertically folding phones. Is all this trouble really worth having a smaller footprint in your pocket? I’m not sure.
They figure it out the flip phone 20 years ago and now they&#39;re trying to figure it out again
5 years later folding phone be cheap
£100/ month for 2 years. £2400! That’s about $3200. What idiot pays that for a phone?
Mixed feelings, just wait a few months, this model is not very good as they think
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=130">2:10</a> It’s like a mini laptop
Samsung is better than iphone
If it&#39;s for 800$ then i will think about it , but on that price range that&#39;s a definite no
Looks like a Gameboy Advance 😂
Zed flip if you&#39;re British
Whats the point of using this over a normal phone
Are there really people in the world so soft they care about creases on a screen touching fingers . Are yall suffering from some sort of hypersensitivity
I suspect the crease in the middle will end up being like the curved edge on  Samsung&#39;s S/Note lineup; some people will hate it, some people will be fine with it
<b>iphone takes out a folding phone 20 years l8r</b><br><b>I&#39;ve seen this one before</b><br><br><b>iPhone users: What are you talking about its brand new</b>
Look. I still want it. Womens pants, dude. They sadly exist and they still refuse to give us actual pockets that go in it !
am i the only one who noticed that it said 68degreds. where is he?
🤭 did I just look at my iPhone wanting to know when Apple will step up to the plate with Iphone flex 💪🏽 no crease or visible hinges 🤔🤣  I’m  looking to buy a flip phone but for now I’ll wait.
you are a really good guy
<b><i>The big question is...  Does it have a &quot;fold counter&quot; app?  So you know before when it&#39;d self-destruct.</i></b>
God it pissed me off saying zee instead of zed
razr vs z flip waiting for...
Has potential its going to happen eventually its the next step in next gen phones can only get better in time so i will wait for now
Really the z flip has an 855+?? That&#39;s stupid, it should have an 865 like it&#39;s s20 counterparts...
Great Video
Some uhm there&#39;s a thing called folding glass?  Good for all the iPhone users with broken screen.
LOOKS LIKE  YOURE IN THE MANDARIN ORIENTAL HOTEL SUITE.  NOW THATS A BACKDROP :)
Closing bezel on bezel, nice try on justifying those ugly things but that makes no sense.  What about the glass in between the bezels? They&#39;re still going to touch
man that&#39;s just a ds
It&#39;s like a slip joint knife... Solid &quot;Walk &amp; Talk&quot;
The z flip looks like an iPhone 🤣
Ok but what is the usage???
you know the crease wont EVER dissapear right? it has to be room for the flip
I can&#39;t wait until sliding phones make a comeback
Just get an apple is all I will say. <br>I’ve had bad experiences with Samsung phones in the past and still have so yea I’m good with my iPhone 7
What is the purpose of the”fold”there
If apple had a phone with a crease Marques would love it
not a fan. that front display is pointless.
Why would I need a folding phone
Can&#39;t put a good protective case = not interested
How far we are from folding an iPad &amp; push it to our pocket?
To be honest, I was waiting for the point where they were gonna replace the plastic screen with a glass one. I think this is a pretty good step up for Samsung given what we have seen from the Fold a while back.
On the razr phone has tiktok on it
Before start: He&#39;s gonna say &#39;I&#39;ve been using this for a while now&#39; for sure.<br>Edit: half an hour? I&#39;ll take it
You forgot to mention it looks like a Gameboy Advance SP.
Does this mean we’re going back to slide phones with full keyboard like we did before? But instead of actual physical keys, it’s gonna be another touch screen keyboard.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiVniW6l7E&amp;t=36">0:36</a> dafuq is that shit? looks like a make up kit LOL
It actually looks cool
Bendy glass?? 🤔
Wanted a preview specifically on &#39;slamming shut&#39; sound and functions.
Come on man there will be crease on anything which will fold
i think they have add physical button for opening this phone it will be easier to open your phone
i bet it gonna break after 3000 flips or 30000 flips
This is such a stupid idea...i think folding phones always looked bad...and this really looks so bad... :(
I don’t like it. Sorry
It’s there for people who needs it ig?
Minnesota greyduck?
snApDraGon
but like...is there any way to put a case on or a protective glass on the screen?
BUT!
this mobile is only for soft handlers. Lol not able to put screen guard on it.
Looks like a better iPhone 8
I love it!
Meh the crease and not being able to read message while its folded killed it for me. Its a good start but with its price and these two issues its a no.
Goddamnit I can&#39;t flex to the kids the feeling of using a flip phone anymore
There’s no need for flip phones. They need to get this idea of bringing them back, out of their heads.
I hat this video only for ads
Bro please review Honor Magic Watch 2... Please
I am so sorry that Apple comes with exactly the same phone every year for extremely high prices. While Motorola, Samsung and other brands are experimenting with the most impressive innovations. This is really going to be the downfall of the iPhone because Apple keeps coming up with the same stupid trick. We are really going to see a shift in brand dominance on the smartphone market and unfortunately Apple, if it does not drastically adjust its strategy, will not win. As an iPhone User I’m thinking about changing brand really hard.
Cannot WAIT til the clamshell design makes a full-on huge comeback and the phone companies make actual better / more developed clamshell smartphones 🥺🥺🥺🥺 I DIG IT!
Pointless phone for the consumer. Your paying to help them design it for the market and by the time it is at point worth buying mobile phones won&#39;t be used as they are now
anything you fold will crease, simple!
Wow we really went full circle
Why are they not doing something like 32 by 9 or 21 by 9?

Does anyone want this
what about a case

Does the back of the phone has a screen to?
The dislikes are from the official Samsung employees!
how to know I&#39;ll buy it:<br><br>does it has a headphone jack?
Please review Galaxy tab S6
Z flop
The only phrase to describe the comment section is “Holy shit, that’s boomer as fuck”
Are they running out of ideas?
Hmmm does the folding go loose in a long time? like if ur playing and u push it slightly it folds a bit
What about if you want to put a tempered glass on it? It will break when you fold
I cannot possibly understand who and why someone would buy this thing or any “folding screen” phone for that matter
When I see a phone like the Z Flip not having a 3,5mm jack, I really get why they did it. This is a phone that needs the extra space, to make room for all the advanced technology that went inside of it. When I see  an iPhone 7 f.e. or any other regular phones I can&#39;t see why they don&#39;t have one. Or why that was &quot;courage&quot;...
Ugh.. <b>one fold</b> is so 2020
WHAT A FUTURE PHONE 🥰🥰🥰
For me, the big question is not which folding phone is the best - but rather, do I have the need for such a device at all?<br>Right now, I earnestly can&#39;t see myself getting such a device at any time soon.<br>My current device has a screen at 6,7 inches, which I carry in my pocket without problem.<br>Nope, personally I cannot see the relevance for folding phones at this point.
Can&#39;t stop laughing, impossible to get a drop case for this. Rubbish &amp; avoid
Beautiful but not very comfortable to use, you never had the need to touch the flip center in old flip flop phones, now you do, it&#39;s just why touch and flip flop aren&#39;t so easy to get along

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the way to fold a phone. I mean, it makes more sense having a small iPad that folds than a normal phone that folding simply get super tiny
Thanks for the review, Now Jerry Rig will take it from here.....
Why
oh shit, the nintendo 3ds got an update
Imagine a laptop with that hinge....ooof 🤭
Sir can u review laptops 😊
For the price, no thanks. This is where the phone companies  are taking advantage. It&#39;s ridiculous.
I think Motorola did better with their foldable phones.
2010: flip phones are no more<br><br>2020: flip phones are back<br><br>2040: we&#39;re bringing back buttons
So... What exactly is the advantage of a folding phone?
Wish you had addressed the issue of how to protect your new, very expensive, phone.. ie, silicone cover, leather cover, screen protector... that seems to me, to be a problem straight away...
can&#39;t wait for a flipxel in a few years!<br>interesting usage with the flipping
Do u get a &quot;Flip Phone Protector!??&quot;...everybody drops their phones!
Yeah I&#39;m filling the fold too, on my 40 years old phone....
Moving parts are a liability. I am not going back to a flip phone no matter how fancy it is. Gone are the days
Wow
May be they use graphene
Omg I an in love with the design, I always like the flip design
Good
Is there any phone case for foldable phone?
No head jack?! <br>No head jack..no phone!
its so easy to sit and comment on a phone right? hard to make one buddy
Why the f ı want my phone to fold in half what is the purpose of it
Mark Ass Brownlee
There&#39;s nothing more to add to phones feature wise so we&#39;re going back to the past and hyping out the ability to have a foldable phone
The fold crease would get annoying when your watching a movie..
I think we are going back in phones
Being an engineer taught me 1 thing. If it consist of moving parts. It will break easly

it reminds me of the gameboy sp
Good Awesome keep it up 👍 would you like be YouTube friends??
moto razer much better
not good phone
I can&#39;t wait for the next new phone: connects to the wall in order to use!
Best foldable phone till now
i like the fact that the chin is the same size as the side and top bezels

I don’t get why anyone would want a foldable phone
Euuuh, no!

This is like my dream phone. Easily pocketable, is it&#39;s own screen protector, still flagship specs. The halfway fold thing is genius.
8k video
The Iraqi people are asking President Donald Trump to rid him of the members of the Iraqi Bernman, all thieves and possessing the billions they stole from oil exports and all of them out of the Bernman
I think women might actually like this phone. The foldable camera with the hinges keeping it upright, will double as a mirror that women carry in the purse. Also foldable makes it take less space in the purse and possibly less scratches on the screen 😉
This thing gives me major Gameboy SP vibes
I hope it is for gaming
First-worlders complaining about how the crease on their FOLDING GLASS DISPLAY is just a little bit too noticeable to the touch 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️y&#39;all should literally be worshipping the engineers who make this stuff even possible.
One flips the other folds.
Consumers are so spoiled. They’ve worked to make a foldable glass phone and no ones surprised by this tech and only complains
Why you complaining about the price? It cost what it cost. <br>I bet you if apple put this out you wouldn&#39;t complain about the price.<br>I held the phone in Singapore, it&#39;s really nice, but I still rather have the Fold. It has a reason to have the fold, this phone is just so Razr doesn&#39;t get a leg up.<br>And there is nothing wrong with crease.
We have the same name mine is marqueswynter
Why is Apple being brought up in the comments section?
Lol I can&#39;t wait to get mad at someone on a call &amp;&amp; slam it to hang up again 😂😂 such great timesss .

2k is the cost I&#39;m guessing
But what is the purpose of the flip on this phone if it only has that tiny display on the front
That&#39;s going to flip my wallet 😂
Needs to be water proofed!
I&#39;m a masochist. Everytime I see a folding phone, im unimpressed and don&#39;t want it. Yet, whenever a new one comes out, I check it out. Wtf is wrong with me? <br><br>Btw. Still have zero interest in a folding phone. They still look stupid, this one with the 2001 folded look 100% irks me the wrong way.
A folding glass. Damn I made it into the future.
That fold line will eventually split
The flip went away in the rest of the world, except for the US, for a very long time. maybe even till the iPhone came out. I see the AMERICANS using a flip phone once again but the world gave up on flips a long time ago, even before the Razr and all. However, like the Tab, there will be a niche lookig for a small phone and until the CREASE goes, we cant be looking at mainstream acceptance
Can&#39;t wait for those GBA SP Emulators.
They are looking really great
Early 00s phones be now like:<br><br>&quot;That was not even my final form!&quot;
I think a foldable tablet would be more useful. Hope we see that one in the near future.
The thumbnail made me scream for a second- even spookier than the penguins of Madagascar phone
Phone looks so sick, I&#39;d buy it
unnecessary.
Buying a folding phone and whining on the crease - fed up with the drama.
Whats the point
1380$ in America..<br>Welcome to Sweden, the most expensive country in the world 1640$ here 🌡
Worst invention of the decade by far.
Um, I think if only the Motorola Razor didn&#39;t have that big chin @ the bottom, I&#39;d be interested in it more than this Galaxy Z flip ;)
imagine breaking your screen
cant wait for flip tablet
it. is. not. glass.<br>please stop repeating samsung&#39;s marketing bullshit just because they paid for a nice visit to san francisco.
HALSS MAREKLAMONG REVIEWER
I think the phone is intended to be used with the Galaxy watch
SAMSUNG. Is it really worth spending 1,400 dollars for a phone that is more likely to crack and break internally, just because it can fit in your pocket better?
$1300 for a phone?  il stick to my galaxy s 3!!!!
Why am I seeing linus in adds now?
I would love to have one, but it costs quite a lot, and I don&#39;t want to look spoiled. You&#39;re welcome Mom and Dad!
what about the protection case? <br>does it flip also?
Moto razr is much more classy, it looks like a real phone, unlike Samsung&#39;s implementation, just a folding slab of glass
That Spectacular Display cancels the Flip line , I mean it&#39;s Super fine Glass Wow &#39; &amp; the Mini siZe is just Super Convenient &quot;.
i tough you could fold it in a tablet
These companies are overpricing the shit out of these folding phones. The only thing this phone does that the other phones don&#39;t is fold. And with those specs, those are 2019 specs. Plus phones have the triple camera nowadays, and this one only has 2. Anyone who buys this phone is getting ripped off. Oh and the display sucks.
I wonder when he&#39;ll realize that anything that folds has a crease? 🤔🤔
Mark ass brownly
He just seems like the soundest guy ever
who is asking for a folding phone?
Looks like a Gameboy SP
No one, and I repeat... NO ONE WILL TOP THE MOTOROLA RAZOR IN THE TOUCH SCREEN FLIP PHONE WORLD.
Too bulky looks like a gameboy advanced sp Razr got it spot on

Why do the foldable phones lack features such as DeX and the Ultrasonic Fingerprint Sensor?
Seriously what is even the point of having a foldable screen phone 🤦‍♂️
Imagine when Apple releases the &quot;first of it&#39;s kind&quot; &quot;groundbreaking&quot; phone called the ifold...
Cool, folding phones with no big notifications screen will make it easier to put them aside and have less distractions I guess.<br>Yet not a single system update to my Galaxy K Zoom phone since it released on 2014, thank you Samsung for causing me to be stuck on Android v4.4.2 forever only because I wanted to have a cool camera-phone :/
<b>2017:</b> Normal comments relating to the video.<br><b>2020:</b> The use of semicolons in every comment.
I think its time for Samsung to consider Galaxy Note Z/Fold series. <br>Its just makes sense s pen would be much more useful with the bigger screen.
I am addicted to the song in the intro by alta
Imagine playing a game like pubg mobile and the screen accidentally close flips. The rage.
StrangeR ThinG..... Minnesota GreyDuck.....
Why is this guys hairline so weird
....but why?
Wouldn’t a case made just for this phone protect it from dirt getting in the hinges
Razer looks so much better aesthetically
Wow, do people really pay $6.99 a month to watch more videos?!
If it folds it&#39;s plastic.
Negro!
Am a man, that makeup glass will pass.   Somebody get me a beer.
Overpriced.
You became such a whiny piece of I don&#39;t even know what
Is that the back of a TV or a computer  blocking the left side of the video ? What&#39;s that about
in my opinion they are going for a direction to differentiate themselfs from other phones hoping it will become the next big thing. Altough it certainly is a cool design, it comes with problems that will appear sooner or later. For example dirt (e.q. pocket sand, etc.) getting into the hinge at some point even with the &quot;protection&quot;, also it will wear our sooner or later, decreasing its lifespan drasticly compared to a normal phone, altough not many people use the same phone for more than 2-3 years.<br>The only pro i can see here is the size through the folding, making it compact. But anything other than that looks just the same for me (they could just make the clock they have on the z-flip on every other phone at the front).<br>All in all it is &quot;just&quot; a foldable phone, trying to stand out of the masses there are and try to get into a new market.<br>I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s worth $1380,00 just because it&#39;s foldable as you can get compareable, not flipable phones for half the price.
Didn’t we all decide as a culture that flip phones were dog shit like 10 years ago? This tech is a joke to me.
that move at the beginning was lame dont do this again..
Flop phone

Can I use my s10 case on this
I dont see why you need a foldable phone, thats not usefull at all
F yu&#39; reviewers Motorola Razr doesn&#39;t have crease big as Samsung z flip and you fail to mention that , shame on you
New Samsung SP looks cool. <br>But seriously imagine the emulators for that!
Probably never gonna buy 1 I am a clumsy person and I don’t see no case or the glass you put on 2 I’m an iPhone person 3 it’s 1000 dollars
Gameboy advance SP the device.
I feel like these kinds of form factors would only majorly benefit something like a Nintendo Switch successor. Kind of like a DS when folded and flat for tv use.
I don&#39;t understand why on Earth we need a folding phone! Isn&#39;t it going to be a pain to open it 1000 times a day?????    This is a fail product.
waste of money
I told my bfs deck
Its evolving just bavkwards
Yes ur invent is looks very good and nice to keep in pocket and its portable as well but when it&#39;s not affordable so what.?
the small display on the front is ultracool
Just found out that we actually got birthday on the same day!
I&#39;ll keep my S10+ thanks.
Sir please if you came in India please meet me
Sir I want to meet you...if possible?
Too much money for a blah phone.
Can’t decide Z flip or S20
lot of hard work for &quot;Jerry Rig Everything&quot; this time..😀😀😆
I want one but not happy with a crease
At first, Samsung made us want to buy big phones. Then, Samsung wanted to convince is that big phones should stay in our pockets and we should buy a smartwatch. And then Samsung wanted us to buy big phones again. And finally, they want us to buy a foldable phone and other ones for +$1000 prices. No thanks.
i wonder what will happen if we put a glass screen guard on the phone..
Not for me...
Fuck smart flip phones, I want a smart sliding phone. Have half the screen available, then slide it up and it seamlessly locks into a full phone display.
My question is why do people want a flippable phone so badly? I thought people wanted to move on from this, I’m sorry but I just think flippable phones don’t look nice at all.
Hi sir  everything r good
The Galaxy fold makes sense to me, although it needs work.<br>This makes no sense you gain nothing by the phone being foldable.
Folding cell are a bad idea. Just a silly FAD just like the curved TV , silly idea that lasted only a year or two.
Cover designers be like now<br>&quot; Ok.f... &quot;.
Always on point
Happy Valentine&#39;s day 😊
Unless the phone can become an origami crane I’m not buyin
I like the T-shirt
I want the S20 5G Ultra but I miss having a flip phone (my first DD was an Sony Ericsson Flip Phone) fight me lmao;
Nice!
Marques with samsung : just not the package <br>Marques with apple: this is the future of smartphones
To pay so much for something really unnecesarry is like wtf.
The  price of this and the razor is ridiculous.
It&#39;s just the 2ND generation let&#39;s give that shit some time
Do you think Apple will do a folding phone in the near future?
You didn&#39;t mention horizontal video quality because of the crease. How is it. Can one watch a video without distortion?
It sounds like there is just more shit to break when you drop it
I want to know what the point is? With the galaxy fold it let u carry a larger tablet in a small form when folded but this phone, like the razor just seems pointless it unfolds into a normal sized phone. Only real advantage is it taking up less space in pocket or bag. But seeing as there&#39;s a crease and got bigger bezels than normal galaxy phones is it really worth it?
Glass is glass and glass will.....

The problem with flip phones is it&#39;s solving a problem nobody had. The innovation of previous generations solves issues, a flip just makes a phone clunkier and has an unnecessary feature.
MKBHD come to MN, its -20 🧊

Brutto non mi piace
I love it when companies other than Apple try and innovate. They just don’t care about the customer experience they just want bragging rights to being first. They should maybe realise that being best for the consumer and having a polished product is way better than having something ratchet and first!
but Why fold phone? why?
Folding phones are such a bad idea
T_T
Why are we making this a thing?
When I watched Samsung Unpacked and they showed this all I could think was ...f i n g e r p r i n t m a g n e t

I feel bad for people who think this is a worth while investment 😂
NICE:D
Gimmicky.
👍⁦♥️⁩
I think it&#39;s a strong step in the right direction but it&#39;s still not really worth it or good enough to choose it over another phone.
I like the aspect ratio you film in, it fits my OnePlus 7pro perfectly
I&#39;d go with the razr for nostalgia and the huge secondary screen.
