Beached dolphins ❤saved they were these mass strandings sadly are dolphins and pilot whales
They have spread the word among their species that we&#39;re friendly, for now.
This makes me think it was a test to see if they are still friends with humans. Dolphins are so intelligent that I really think it could be possible 😂
Obrigado Deus por pessoas desse tipo no mundo, que tu as abençoe á cada dia❤🇧🇷
There are zero women helping out. So often, when shit comes to shove, the ladies are well away.
Even dolphins use Google Maps apparently.
That&#39;s a great video. I will always cheer for you in Korea I&#39;m looking forward to a great video. Have a nice day.
God bless you
Wao bello el hecho de ayudarlos ❤
God bless your heart. Two brave ladies.

What a beautiful scene! Humans helping less fortunate animals.  I guess humans have a purpose too. This brought tears to my eyes.
Dolphins are not fish. They will not suffocate if stay out of water 😊.  In that respect the &#39;savers&#39; timing was not that  critical. Maybe they should think of lifting each dolphin by pairs. Not dragging them by the tail😅.
I wonder if orca`s chased them in?
Greetings, bro, I&#39;m from Aceh, the beach is very beautiful... lots of fish come ashore, right?
Acho muito bem o que as pessoas estão a fazer para salvar os golfinhos para não morrer é lindo.
I was amazed at the efforts of the men . The woman , who want equality just stood their and offered no help . 😊
Faith in humanity restored...
it&#39;s possible the dolphins were testing the humans,. and they reacted with compassion, community, a common unity, humans and dolphins together
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Wow! Bottlenose dolphins!
Wow, when the man kind is at it&#39;s best.
What about the fish?🙏🏻🙏🏻
Good job bro
Love
It&#39;s like humans when they to suicide they get into the sea and when shark wants to suicide they get on land.

Dumm humans we are fine the tide was gonna rise in a couple minutes.
🌈The cyrpto market has been unstable. People ask themselves if this is the right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. Crypto is the best way to make earnings due to the recent outbreak. Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a particular thing, we always lose focus and then invest or spend the money wrongly. Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by trading. I&#39;m an investor and am winning by applying the same method in every trade, you can also become a winner today. We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls or bears) which is trading. Buy the Dip and trade, I have made over 16 btc profits not just by buying the dip but implementing trades with signals supplied by expert Jay Pelle FX .
So glad everyone was in the right place at the right time!!  but im so jealous of PPL walking by that has a better view of the actual dolphins!! seeing that YOU ,MR CAMERA MAN/GIRL was not helping y are you standing a whole continent away from the action ?

That was in Arraial do Cabo, a small village in the north of Rio de Janeiro (state), Brazil. The men are speaking in Portuguese. It&#39;s very common to see big turtles, whales, dolphins, sharks and so forth in that place.

ad for apples new beach pod ^^<br>now that must be some fabulous vacation spot for 30 dolphins to try to walk out of the sea - nah <br>maybe they were hunting (hydroplaning) fish or they just got reeaally confused all 30 dolphins at once... maybe they didnt do this for the first time? or maybe..you can see that an entire group can be mislead by irritated leaders? hmm...  <br>great atmosphere, everybody jumping in to rescue like they do this all day - and afterwards the cheering crowd - what a &quot;moment&quot;. faboo
Hi
Great job guys, and let&#39;s not forget that dolphins help humans at sea too, especially against shark attacks.
Amazing how they help them get to the sea right  away , without  taking pictures.

They ar either eating school of fish or avoiding some predator
Dolphins have saved humans in the past so it’s only right to return the favour.
I am the guy who wants to know why, because i dont believe nature would do that. Just curious, you guys hear the weird background noice, like a bass? BRRRR      BRRRRR.
Well, i just learnt the technique to un beach a dolphin, the tail drag

Superrr heroes...good job friends...you people proved that we are humans....bravooo...
Dolphins sometimes go to shores because they are not feeling well. Maybe in this case, their Alpha Dolphin is not feeling well so every dolphin followed their alpha to the shores.
Agiram rápido parabéns
Yep I salute you guys for saving those dolphins it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekmMD8oYtJ0&amp;t=480">08:00</a> there I wonder what time it was in the UK

Dolphin: Darn, we wanted to build sand castles too! Humans have all the fun!!!!
👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
They are really human
Thanks all for what you&#39;ve done to these dolphins
i dont think they saved many. most of them just drowned once they were dragged into deeper water
Very nice brother save the dolphins dolphins
Great job 👍👌🙏love you all<br>GOD bless you all brothers &amp; sisters... thanks bro👍🙏🙏🇮🇳
NO,There&#39;s a monster out there!!!
dolphins: LET THE INVASION COMMENCE<br>dolphins: ...<br>dolphins: help....?
No one from them tried to catch the dolphins for their benefit.<br>That&#39;s Great!!
Great
Damn humans! Our invasion has failed, but we&#39;ll come back soon with a bigger army!
Nice🙏
this is why dolphins help human
They were probably chasing small fish. Lucky nice people where there to save them or they would have died.
Great work
Saya mewakilin ikan lumba2 saya ucapkan terimaksih kepada semua warga di sana🤝👃
what the fuk, pathetic. They&#39;ll definitely be extinct, at most in a few million years. Ichthyosaurs were supposedly identical to dolphins, though even more specialized! No wonder they themselves suddenly went extinct in the Cretaceous [25 million years before the meteorite], if they did stupid $hit like this it&#39;s no wonder.
💚
👍👍
I wonder why they headed out to beach themselves, though. It happened so fast...As if something was perturbing them or trying to hunt them. Sometimes rarities won&#39;t happen just because... Plus Dolphins are one of the cleverest marine mammals. They wouldn&#39;t beach themselves like this because they miscalculated their swimming orbit, would they?  Still, &#39; Glad they were saved.
Awesome! :-))))
Nice
Nice. Happened in Brazil.
Come on, brother and sister, any channel, stop by at my place, I definitely fully support💪
👍☝
The dolphins were like; come to my belly you fishy...... NOOOOOOOO!
Human being 👌👌🙏🙏
हम भी देखना चाहते हैं किसी को पता है इस जगह का नाम<br>Coment  में जवाब दीजिए<br>प्लीज
यह कहा का सीन है
Geesh let them try to save  themselves before you start &quot;helping&quot; them before they even beach themselves , just so you can feel good about yourself and for the admiration of the beach thots.
God bless every single of you angels
I THINK THEY WANNA BE STRANDED THAN BEING EATEN BY ORCAS.

12 thousand Japanese people disapprove.
They were chasing (hurding) Jack&#39;s, or rays. They werent stranded lol. But nice to see people help them faster than wriggling out with the tide.
Dolphin pulls a stunt like that in China and they will kill and eat them.  Shows the cultural maturity and superiority of the western culture.
Dolphine: want to feed,<br>Human: save the dolphine<br>Lol
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The dolphins c@me to say hi
Awesome job people
Dolphins decided to sucide<br>But human didn&#39;tt allowed
Thanks for all men saved these wonderful creatures!!! God bless you all !!!!
Yet humans, at times, will slaughter their own species. We are the best and worst of the animal world.
Just amazing great job everyone cheers 🕶🕺🕺-The Boyz
Jesus bless you all.  thank you thank you.
Dolphin lives matter
Dolphins&#39;: Hoomans, We&#39;re here to join you!<br>Dolphins beach  and are thrown back.<br>Dolphins&#39;:  Ok, guess you get land and we get sea.
Dolphins wondering which rookie leading took a wrong turn.
nice video
Not one woman helping
most intelligent creatures yet they don&#39;t know how to turn around and swim the other direction xdd
Путина  за ноги и туда же !
Nah they were just having a dance party

It&#39;s beautiful thing i seen ever in my life,human being done a great job, Why 12 k people unlike video?
submarine or warship sonar
They just wanted to hang out with you guys... people are good, dolphins are great.
Who in the FUCK gives 12k  &#39;&#39;thumbs down &#39;&#39;....is there really that many Trumpanzees viewing this stuff ???
Dolphins are not stupid, they new that if they beached, the hoomans would grab them and take them back to the water, they were needy.
Love how all the women stood there watching instead of helping. L<br><br>dolphins aren&#39;t light so that was impressive to drag them out. Several dolphins too
Claps Not Enough.....If they listen even Now..I could have whistle until I get exhaust..!! 😍😍😍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏Life Savers ....and guy who given great Visuals.!!!! ^_^ ^_^
Great job everyone there!
These guys are amazing! Such a cool experience they’ll remember forever. Poor dolphin I wonder what they were thinking
Thank  you humans thaj you love animais 🙏🙏🙏❤🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪👍👍👍
Всем огромное русское СПАСИБО из Забайкалья!!?👍👍👍✊👊👊👊☝☝☝✋
&gt;Hooray to the heroes!&lt; But why are all the women just watching? None got the guts to help out?

Dolphins visit people too...
昼間の人が海辺に来てる時で良かったな
Looks like a mass suicide pact.   Maybe dolphins also have crazy religious cults.
They all came for suicide, humans saved them
Parabens!
Brazil.
Thank goodness enough of the men understood the danger the dolphins were in and helped them.
I can’t believe you counted all of them!!<br>Me: 1...2.... 3....? I am tired 😓
Классно сработали👍🤝
Mujeres inútiles nada más observan pero no ayudan
Only respect!!
From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekmMD8oYtJ0&amp;t=114">1:54</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekmMD8oYtJ0&amp;t=120">2:00</a>, the gentleman with purple shirt is the fastest one. He already knows how to handle the situation and grabs the Dolphin from his tails while others try to lift them from the middle of their bodies. Maybe ha had done this before; nevertheless, credit to all of them for helping these magnificent creatures back to their natural habitat.
Ma quanta gente imbranata ed inutile esiste!!!
BRAVO  and thank you from The Netherlands
Notice how the dolphins just relax when they got drag. They know the human was saving them.
Notice that MOST of the people helping were men? Everyone wants to be a cowboy/hero. Couldn&#39;t risk looking weak in front of their partners/family.<br><br>I suspect this because most of them would not behave this way and they see people in need of help on a daily basis.
The Sounds From the dolphins 😍😍😍
Great work
There are good people on the planet.
Ty and God bless you all
Cooperative people

Bravo! 👏🏻
Well this shows that men and women are equal but women are good at something and men are good at something else.  You can&#39;t say men are good at anything so are women.  We should respect each other like how these women let the men do their job and gave applause to them.
Crying crying 😭😢.thank all off you can not talk more.
I do not have marine knowlidge, but was thinking maybe the dolphins saw/sensed some danger in the see not visible to the naked eye.
That was so beautiful and awesome to watch those little sweethearts be saved by amazing people. Also I can’t help but notice that 12,000 people disliked this video?! Wtf is wrong with you people?!
Esse lugar é lindo por natureza... Prainha de arraial do cabo.
Thank dog they was dolphin, imagine if 30 of orcas...
Those Dolphins were trying to escape being hunted by Orcas. This Beach is a place with mounts at two sides. They had no way to escape else the dry beach. See one of the Orcas at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekmMD8oYtJ0&amp;t=73">01:13</a> minutes.
10 star post you&#39;ve gained a Fan here<br>by the way I&#39;ve a small educational channel and It will be awesome  if you would join my youtube channel family<br>All the Love<br>👶🏼
So much wonderful things to do by many people help out dolphins in water back to ocean 🐳🌤️🦚🕊️
My first thought was the dolphins wanted headpats ._.
They are all the best men.
Pulling from the tail may hurt their wings 😟
Decent ! Well done people
Eso se llama restitución 👏👏👏👏al planeta a la vida
Waves push with more force in sea shore. So dolphins were not able to return. . <br>Life is not that easy for animals 😣...<br>Human should be protector of these animals
🙏🙏🙏👍
(👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏)n   👍

Why do people just film the save and not help when they see a lot of dolphins on the land
вот это мужики
people r just standing there just help them for cries sake
Que Deus abençoe cada um de vocês
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I am soooooo soooooo happy it happened during the day while bathers were out ..  Thank you to all for saving these amazing creatures 🌹🌸❤️🌺💓🌷🌼
SAVE THE DOLPHINS! DONT BE AN IDIOT WHO TAKES PICTURES OF A DEAD ANIMAL!
Wow great job ❤️❤️
I hope this was a natural phenomena and not ELF waves shocking them to shore.  Good job guys.
Thanks to all of you to save dolphins
It happened in Brazil, Arraial do Cabo, Prainha Beach
🐬 These folks are in my prayers!!! The sooner people realize that us humans aren&#39;t the only 1s who need help, the world would be a better place.  &#39;2 friends are better than 1. That way, if the 1st friend falls, the 2nd friend can help him up&#39;.  This is in the BIBLE!!!  ♥🖖🙏
Half the idiots sat there watching
Wow amazing nice ples 🐟🐟🐟🐟👌👍 and subscribed New ಫ್ರೆಂಡ್
They always help us. So it&#39;s time to return the favor.  God bless these kind souls .
Wow...! ❤👏
“So long &amp; thanks for all the fish!”
They were going on land to become humans you dumb shi+s they&#39;re evolving.
Great job... Thanks
The instinct of us humans wanting to help these Dolphins, is same as what I believe the Dolphins&#39; instinct of wanting to help us humans from Shark attack, drowning etc which were reported several times before.
I love this people

Fuck the Japan people like kill the dolphins or whale for their Cook~ i hate Japan~
Parabéns a todos 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
<b>SAVE THEM DOLPHINS WOHOO!</b>
I know its not right, and they need to be in the wild,  but I know if I was there, some part of me would of wanted to keep one,   Great job to everyone that helped out...
Ça fait plaisir de voir des gens sauver ces créatures....même si d&#39;autres préfèrent les contempler dans leur galère.
chinese people will eat them all
Anyone who saves a dolphin automatically goes to heaven❤️❤️🐬🐬✨✨
👏👏👏👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏
The real Humans...
Gracias 🙏
Good deed,👍
Thank you guys super well done
april 2, 2020 there was even a wild dolphin ( a thumbler, also to find on youtube now) in The Netherlands, followed a ship more day&#39;s. He was stranded after even swimming through a lock with the ship, stranded in a lock of Amsterdam. They managed it after the second time to release her to the sea with a boat again, again through the lock. I hope he find his way back to France in a healthy way, where he was coming from. I hope he will survive, our sea water is not so clear and there is a lot of ships sailing there and through the France-UK Canal.<br><br>A dolphin traveling through the Canal and through a lock, very very rare, especialy in The Netherlands. Why would a dolphin do that in the first place in such busy and dirty waters?
This is the way we are supposed to be.  Have compassion for other animals with the exception of rats and other pests.
Good job everyone!!!👏👏👏
👍👏👏👏👏👏
So why is there 12k dislikeas<br>Do i swe humane? Do i see abuse? So i see anything bad?<br><br>What are you disliking this video for?<br><br>Also rhe cmameraman suck at holding his camera....
Once you watch enough of these &quot;animals being saved by humans&quot; videos you start to see a pattern. 95% of the time it is MEN who go out of their way to save animals. This video is a perfect example. All men helping while the women stand around and gawk. Us men really get a bad rap for being evil animals when in reality we are the more altruistic of the sexes.
They were probably escaping from the Orca&#39;s killer whales.
What is it?
apparently they not that smart after all
Did the tide bring them in?
yay happy ending for the dolphins!
The dolphins were running away from predators
Bravi
The dolphins are fishing. They use this technique to corner their fish on land and then slide back to sea with the waves. But this technique can at times get them stranded. But maybe they took a bigger risk by going even further to land knowing there are humans there that will help them back. Clever dolphins haha
Great Job
👏👏👏👏👏👏
30 men 0 woman helping 😳

Эти люди все герои, Дай бог им счастья в жизни и животным тоже, слёзы на глазах когда видишь такое !!!!<br>👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️
in these bad times for everyone around the world things like this make you smile again .
Heheheheh so sweet adorable
Why did they all swim up on the beach in the first place? Strange behavior. :p
Mashaa Allah
Nice
You know if they beached in the wrong country they&#39;d probably just get killed and eaten by people.
I love dolphins, brought back my memories of the edge of pacific islets in tahiti while in vacation..watched them flies high and speedy movement..they are so beautiful ... big thanks to those guys who helped pull these creatures back to the sea..such a kind heart of yours..god bless all those who are saving sealife animals back to where they belong..thank you.
Didn&#39;t anyone notice that a man first removed his slippers, then removed his shorts and then go for saving the dolphins at the starting 😂😂
Quite amazing to watch at the beginning. They, the dolphins, seem determined to beach themselves. looks almost if they have been scared, running away from something. I sort of expected  to see the fins of some killer whales chasing them.

God job  BRAVISSIMI
Who’s watching today?
Put down the camera numb nuts
Great people
Why not just pick them up by the torso ? Instead of dragging their entire body weight by their tails and causing stress and muscular tension/strain ? <br>:/
Maybe we&#39;ll live together, side by side, no matter what terrain we live on little dolphins.<br>Just not today...... not yet.
Glad to see all the women helping
😂😁🥰💙💜❤💕
I&#39;ve seen a whale get beached but never so many dolphins. Why is this happening?
I wish the whole world was like this when it came to saving animals
heartwarming to see humans do something right
Aww... yall did an amazing job:)  this is something I would love to do..

Gooooooooooooood
👍👍😘😘
Maybe if you just left them alone, they could have made it to their bicycles and continued the race.  But nooo.  Y&#39;all gotta &quot;rescue&quot; them.  Typical humans.  This is why you rarely see wild animals competing in triathlons.
Why did they beach themselves though, were they running from something cause it seems like unusual behavior for dolphins anyway I’m glad these people helped, all it took was one person taking action, others followed suit, well done people
Where is this sea?

Tfw u realize Dolphins breathe air
Usually dolphins save humans from drowning, quite the opposite here!
Heb zin in haring.
They were either hunting or something disrupted their echolocation sensors.They sometimes beach themselves to hunt but I doubtt that&#39;s what happened here. Great job stepping in though.
Thanks to those ppl for not killing it for likes on there instagram
The reason why dolphins and whales beach themselves is because the submarines are sonar testing and makes the mammals go nuts! They end up beaching themselves! Its messed up! And the people need to recognize this!
