Sushant ke bad sandesh-- aa ja beta teri manokamanaputti kar ja beta! Bhagawanaji,aap ki daya mahan! My boy sushant aaja!
I am from kashmir ❤I just love him. He is complete package I would have followed him in acting but I am alhamdulillah muslim. I used to hate studies after I regard him my ideal I start to study much  just to follow him now I look too much to study then I decided to enter in competition and I crack jkpsi. I miss him❤
Albert Einstein write a letter to Madam curie <br>If you ever care yourself with deliberate negative reviewers  if you have to do it  that then just measure the length of the article  you need a ruler for that !<br>What a thought❤😊
Kedarnath movie is best❤❤
After looking at sushant&#39;s intelligence level, I got to know one thing that even such an intelligent person can choose a wrong partner for himself
Give justice to SSR and Disha saline and Jiya K for Indian public 🙏🙏
Again he has said the problem of his life too he doesn&#39;t know what to chose even to whom to choose for life partner or as gf also he did mistake .you can get to know his secret of his life in his video only
See all he said on a serious note he kept the character of Monsoor in real life too .Monsoor died in reel life saving someone Sushant too died in real life trying to give justice for someone or saving someone .it seems there is similarlity
He could have actually been the last of the stars but because he was already a star they killed him, mark my words all the killers will be put behind the bars because the public won’t spare them.<br>The matter has reopened already.
Nice interview
3 years have passed. See SSR we have not forgotten you.
Love coming back to hear him speak ❤
Miss you lot sushant sing rajput ❤

It seems that SSR was on some medication while recording this interview.
PERFECT MAN WITH Gentleman interviewer
I have been assigned a project on AI today. I came here to listen to you, my project will be dedicated to you, Sushant.
Wonderful annalises about the movie. Thoughts differ. A true fact as man differs.Time and place  makes the difference..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1640">27:20</a>    he describe himself as paradox.paradox is a logically self-contradictory statement or a statement that runs contrary to one&#39;s expectation.<br> <br> It is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to a seemingly self-contradictory or a logically unacceptable conclusion. A paradox usually involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time. They result in &quot;persistent contradiction between interdependent elements&quot; leading to a lasting &quot;unity of opposites&quot;.In logic, many paradoxes exist that are known to be invalid arguments, yet are nevertheless valuable in promoting critical thinking, while other paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions that were assumed to be rigorous, and have caused axioms of mathematics and logic to be re-examined
Even If I Die hits hard💔💔💔
Love you more 💖 miss you more<br>Sushant Singh Rajput 💫 Justice4SSR
This interview is so different interview among all his interviews I have watched, he is so unconscious like he has taken some druggs or something else. He is not normal in this interview.
He is an institute in himself. Marvelous brain with positive attitude.
Sushant Singh Rajput, his intelligence &amp; equally a golden heart make him a rare gem of Indian Cinema 💖💕 Always in our hearts ❣

:):
I can listen to him for hours and hours on end.
Kanika Dhillon is the reason which can cause so much communal hatred.
Just wow.....
What a tragedy man. Such a gem was murdered. And IT WAS MURDER NOT SUICIDE. Faridoon does not get what Sushant spoke of coming technology. Sushant was bang on.
The one line he says &quot;Our ignorance cannot stop what is inevitable&quot; is so true!
Look at the face of interviewer😅. He is feeling like he is sitting in the Schrondinger&#39;s wave eqn class and trying to undertand. The understanding of SSR is remarkable. Miss you my idol❤️
Goosebumps when he started speaking 🥺😢❤️ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsinghrajput">#JusticeForSushantSinghRajput</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justicefordishasalian">#JusticeForDishaSalian</a>
I would have enjoyed this interview if it was fully discussed in English... I get lost in the Hindi dialect.  I feel the interview is a jigsaw
Such an intellectual, brilliant, humble, honest actor. Rare gem 💎 for sure our dear Sushant ❤️‍🩹
He is so dehydrated in this interview... wish we could wind back time and knock away the demon, and save the angel
It is this intelligence and awareness in him that causes me think he did not commit suicide. He is too smart for that. Truly we have lost a great lovable human being.
He is very  intelligent <br>But  in this  interview something is wrong
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1540">25:40</a>
He is very subtle in his thinking
Well!.. There is Schrodinger&#39;s smile on his shirt 🥲🥰.... Someone who understands Quantum Mechanics will get that 😍
sir 😭😭
if nepo star kids didnt killed him, he surely become the King of Indian Films and might have reached hollywood level. But killing him just woke up the people from how dirty workers and murderers bollywood nepo stars are.
Samee sr
awesome man
Some sections of the shallow Bollywood didnt understand him and hence mocked him.... he&#39;s one of the best brains in Bollywood or in Indian cinema
Ssr a mind they trying yocp trol by drugs he slightly stamnersit is effect of toxic o his nf
Faroodin trying hard to understands for first time cos he met with one intelligent guy for change
I met him in connaught place, new delhi. This was back in 2012 when he had just quit tv and was about to leave for new york for an acting course before starting in the movies.. He was there with his then girlfriend ankita and couple of friends. I was with there with my parents. Mom dad both used to watch pavitra rishta (his tv show) and dad told me to go say hi to him and get a picture with him.<br>Still share that picture on his every birth anniversary and death anniversary.
Just because he is bluntly revealing everything the interviewer is not so much invested or intrested in him
Justice for ssr and disha
He has not been killed and he is living in our hearts...! <br>I wish he wouldn&#39;t come to Bollywood bastards and live life as a top scientist in the world...
Brutally murdered | leg frustrated | niddled in feets | Drugs | Disha Salian | Underworld | Bollywood | planners SK and family | Difficult to see anyone so pure like him.
He was most knowledgeable  in bollywood  I haven&#39;t  seen anyone.
Sushant when u will realize that stuborn stuborning is no good u have been putting all my family members down with ur evilness black red white blue magic n on other side ur enjoying ur self with nude womens in india ur free to marry.FEAR ALLAH UL B ALONE IF U DONT STOP BAD EVIL JADOO MAGIC
If ssr would have done tumbbbad ufff bhai sahab.........
❤❤❤<br>miss him a lot💔💔💔
Justice for Susjhant  i miss you
He said he knows what&#39;s going to happen in 10 years from now...amazing
Till now people are screaming for your justice... It gives me a deep depression that here we r demanding your justice but we can&#39;t get it and it shake me, create anxiety that we have not u... Sushant you can never come, I can&#39;t say to anyone that I&#39;m fan of sushant and I want to meet him🥺 I can&#39;t see u again on silver screen, can&#39;t live with the fact the one with whom I inspire is not here in this world... It breaks me sushant, any justice can never heal me 1% of my grief... No matter how much I convince that I&#39;m ok with this bitter truth, I will be happy, strong but at some points, I become too much depressed, hopeless, sad.... What a loss my angel, I can&#39;t denie this fact, it makes me stronger... But it&#39;s painful very painful, if once u come everything will be ok... Not ok it will be more then ok.... Come back yaara...
इतना इंटेलिजेंट आदमी कभी खुद को खत्म नहीं कर सकता है।।। Sushant Singh Rajput was Brutally Murdered by bollywood Mafia 💯 Justice for SSR
Ssr
Sushant was so intelligent that this gutter wood was not a fit place to him ….. India nd Indians needed this talented Guy …. God bless you Sushant wherever u r .🙏
World know how brutually u were murdered but when it&#39;s time of justice our system is failed. Still we r getting abuses.. We r called as ssr bots, stupid, jobless and what not. Is it ok to live like this, there r a lot of crimes happen around us how can we keep shut. You taught us to always stand against this crimes. They killed u, this disgusting bollywood r still involved in illegal activity but if we r against them we r fools. What a hell world this is.

Such an interesting and intellectual person, cannot stop listening and learning from him. Who would have thought three years down the road, people with vested interest would murder him in cold blood and say he committed suicide. Definitely not a suicidal person.

SUSHANT ❤
How politely and gently u use to talk man.

Highly intellectual ❤️
What happened to AI after SSR death?
Too intelligent for bwood.  Sometimes,  I wish he had ditched bwood and he would be still alive. India&#39;s young would have followed him, regardless of bwood.
Wow!!! This guy is such a visionary.  Amazing breadth of knowledge for an actor.
Tum aoge kabhi puri zindagi lekar, bari lambi guptgu krni h, akhir itne din jo gujare h tumhare bina 😭😔
बॉलीवुड में तब तक नेपोटिज्म रहेगा जब तक हम नेपोटिज्म से उठे लोगों की मूवी आ देखते रहेंगे अगर उनकी मूवी देखना बंद कर दें और उनकी जब कमाई बंद हो जाएगी तो फिर वह उन्हीं एक्टर को लेंगे जो मेहनत के दम पर आगे बढ़े हैं जैसे कि सुशांत सिंह राजपूत और कई एक्टर सुशांत सिंह राजपूत दुनिया के सबसे बेहतरीन एक्टरों में से एक ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wish I can learn a lot of things from u, life is become cruel with u 😔
Love you SSR, waiting for your ressurection!♥️♥️
Sare anpadho k bich 1 hi vidwaan
He sounds like great Professor. 🙏
After the first question<br>Interviewer - wait what ohhh...
Simply adore him and his beautiful poetic name
Do anyone have this interviwe translated in english ?
Still can’t believe this gem is gone! Nobody else compares to him, he comes across as nothing but a hardworking, genuine, humble, but absolute intellectual genius! My bitterness towards every other Bollywood celeb is on another level. Screw the Khan’s, Kumar &amp; Kapoor’s!
Genius
Superb answer on getting the context right... I knew there was a person called SSR when he was alive... But after his death... We know there was a martyr a legend called SSR
Is anchor ko AIEEE bhi nahi pata.. jo bol rha hai AI E E E..oh come on. Tum kya loge ssr ka interview or kya smjoge  inko
You&#39;re still my favourite<br>Will always remain so .  True talent🌟
Most talented actor I have ever seen in the Bollywood industry. <br><br><br>Bollywood druggist brutally murdered him.<br>Hey Shiv Sambhoo bless your pure soul and serve him justice.🙏❤️🕉️🔱
All in one man Army Mr SSR❤...I havent seen this energetic in Dirtywood.SSR was out of all..he was Genius.<br>Boycott Gutterwood
Is he saying that he mayb playing a detective later on in real life mayb ? Are there clues in his interviews ?
Completely cheated by Bollywood cheaters n fake friends.
Will remember you even in 2060
Rhea entered his life just during this- see his face color changed how
Reading all the comments n listening Sushant Singh Rajput tears come out of my eyes. As if they hv killed God. He is very unique, no one can ever take his place. Bollywood mafia gutterwood were  very very jealous n afraid of losing their powers. But he makes them flop in all ways. They killed him but he is still killing them. The killers(all linked)are really cursed n they will never be successful, happy n in peace. <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#JusticeforSSR</a>
Ssr we all miss yu 💔
Faridoon do you realize what a connection you had with Sushant? You are able to bring out the nuances of Sushant&#39;s brilliance, mind...why did you edit the part where he requested you to sing with him?..Please release that song you sang together...
Justice for Sushant Singh Rajput 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
He is fumbling a lot unlike him coz of the damn drugg that witch administrated in him in coffe without him knowing
He looks dull the sparkle of his eyes the smile and bright face with giggling laugh all has gone coz tai was administrating drugs I&#39;m his coffe and his life was in a mess
This is Sushant house
U r again acting<br>.... stop being emotional
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1545">25:45</a> broke
How cute he smiles man ...no body will forget himm believe me
Highly intellectual and articulation with clarity of thought.. believe he was much more than an actor!<br>Farriddun had v intelligent questions but looked v puzzled with his reaction at his answers!
Love you Sushant and we want justice for Sushant 🙏
If I change my name trump ,,,,,,best reply to shut the mouth up humbly
💔
Why he said he was born on Saturday 11.30 pm when his birth date 21st Jan 1986 fall on Tuesday??
Why did you do, what you did?
Beautiful explanations expressed. Love the way this angel has explained the difference between core relation and causation. I am a teacher by profession and there could not be a more simpler way for me to explain the same to my grade 6 class wherein they understood so clearly. SSR has helped me in my profession with his reasoning and definitions on math and science.
Honest brilliant person🙏
Smartest person , people can learn from him They really lost such a extra smarter Soul. He can’t be in Bollywood HE WILL COME BACK IN BIGGEST WAYS ON EARTH 🕉🙏🕉

Very talented and intelligent guy SSR.  So sad bad people killed him.
Faridoon&#39;s interviews with Sushant are the most interesting. He has the art of asking a question and allowing  the person to have their say without interrupting! And his questions are intelligent instead of just being nosy or gossipy.
Observe the expression of the interviewer 😀😀 cofused .. everything is going over his head..
A beautiful mind ❤️
What a thoughtful, eloquent and observant individual. Bollywood did not deserve this pure soul. Rest In Peace … namo namo🙏
He is too clever others in bollywood are dumbs with  no brains just  want money that&#39;s why they murdered him of jealously <br>The ones who murdered him are vultures
Who&#39;s that stupid reviewer by comparing A Character name with Sara Ali Khan&#39;s grandfather?
Such a Humble Human Being. When he said &#39;Aap Gaoge ?&#39;

I know him as a Manav <br>But when I saw him in Main tera boyfriend song  I was made and wanted to check his real name and now I know that He is Our Sushant Singh Rajput My love  So proud of you ❤️❤️
I don&#39;t know why I am watching in2021  but he is really a gentle hero for Indian youth
He was the most knowledgable factual hardworking habitual man not just like so called their  nepo kids and just typical Salman Khan who always do 2-3 same steps and same acting  in his all movies
Juz like how he sacrificed his life for a young boy in Kedarnath similarly he did so in real life becos he wanted to expose some villains. He is a real hero. He was a very accomplished actor in such a short time but some people became jealous of him. One can see his intelligence the way he speaks and that is something lacking among many bollywood celebrities. Really so devastating this wonderful guy gone too soon. Justice must take its course and the public and his fans will not give up until the villains responsible are thrown into jail(hell).

This guy was the best in industry I believe...We will miss him
Why do I feel that the interviewer is just pretending to understand whatever Sushant is saying and not really listening to him !!!
Abe chal saale jhoothe
I&#39;m hopeless.. I never know what kills him, why he leave
Amazed at what a person he was. Have watched it multiple times and still find it so hard to move on or treat this as just one more sad event. The tragedy is heartbreaking when you listen to him

I have watched this interview multiple times and each time I am in awe of the insightful and honest responses from Sushant Singh Rajput. My heart aches to come to terms with the loss of this extraordinary human being with a beautiful mind! <br>Respect for the interviewer too for allowing SSR to get his point across.
Sushant Singh Rajput Kohinoor of Bollywood and India - God Bless Him Rest in Peace Son - Justice will come and Murderers will be caught - here I find SSR looks very tired - poor soul, if only he had gone home to his sister - Miss him
Love you Sush❤️
This is exactly the reason why bollywood wanted him dead!!! His brilliance in everything he did!! It was too much for them to handle!!!
Unmatched level of intelligence. Miss you sooo much Sushant 💔💔😭😭
I wish I could go back in time for you and hold your hand and bring you back in light, happiness... And lastly I could save u... There was so much to doing, to learn us,,, so much to give... We need a person like u in this dumb world... Miss u man...
Justice for Sushant Singh Rajput 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ye interviewer ko to ghanta samaj nhi aa rha hai kuch v bate Sushant bhai ki. How someone can understand everything so deeply 🙏🙏🙏
Missing you lot♥️❤️😭😭😭😭😭😭SSR please come back if possible 😭😭🕉️🙏🙏🕉️🕉️🙏😊💐✨✨😊❤️💞 SSR ❤️♥️ SSR ♥️♥️
He should have been a scientist
This is the most different actor I&#39;ve ever seen.  He extremely intelligent. I wish He could come back. Bollywood is so small platform for such an intelligent man.
I see his interview often to get motivation and wish if I could get 1% of his knowledge and analytical brain to explain the things differently with lot of sense.
He was genius and it is not easy to understand his perspective of looking things differently.
Brilliant....we lost a GEM❤️
Firdoos is the only interviewer who understands his words...

How well he analyses his on screen character....no wonder the buffoons in Gutterwood couldn&#39;t accept him
I wonder who are the 59 people who disliked this video of Sushant. They must be complete morons,dhurrs
This anchor is always clean bowled with the depth of Sushant’s Intellect and clarity in thoughts in his answers
Same ochre yellow colored chair Ankita  Lokhande madam too was sitting on in her Republic interview 😮😲
In this he looks a bit drained out sadly ... than he was in Dhoni interview on same channel .. life !!
Why the anchor&#39;s face is so blank.. 😂😂
Kedarnath was hit only because of our sushant 💥.... sushant have done absolutely brilliant job in this movie, when I seen this movie in theater, sushant ✨was in my mind for complete one month such impact of sushant ✨was in this movie....Love you Sushant ♥️ and miss you Sushant 💫
O God 13 no. is so unlucky for him .His mother passed away on 13th of December and he passed away on 13th of June..
Boycott Bollywood druggies
&quot;We all act, all the time ...&quot;. <br><br><br><br>Few in the industry would understand that, much less admit or declare so publicly. <br><br>Most telling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=915">15:15</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1037">17:17</a>,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1065">17:45</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1161">19:21</a> and very true. <br><br>He knew all this, understood and yet didn&#39;t yearn to flee that morass, that quagmire? To take flight into the pure blue above?<br><br>Incidentally, did either of these guys, or any of the others, realise that the film was a slightly reworked adaptation of The Ottoman Lieutenant? The writer and the maker had to know, of course, but presumably they wouldn&#39;t admit the plagiarism. <br><br>&quot;Trivial issues like religion&quot; - ever tried telling that in either bible belt, or at the turnoff to your ultimate pilgrimage spot where &quot;others&quot; are not allowed within miles of the town? Ever tried to enter Lourdes without Vatican permission? <br><br>No, it&#39;s much more comfortable to throw guilt at India isn&#39;t it! <br><br>Try China, where foreingers were not allowed within borders (very graphic descriptions in Amitav Ghosh works), and non Chinese are referred to commonly as either &quot;ugly barbarians&quot; or &quot;foreign devil&quot;. <br><br>You might condescendingly ascribe that to lack of familiarity. You couldn&#39;t be more wrong. The usage of those terms is common in U.S. too, by Chinese towards others. Not first generation migrants, but locals born and brought up, in local high schools. <br><br>Re lyrics, especially the anchor&#39;s favourite, he fails to realise how badly it is written. Someone who not only lives and works at a pilgrimage spot and earns his living by taking pilgrims up, or back down, is using terms like kaafir about the girl he&#39;s falling headlong over heels for, even though his defining song as per Sushant is &quot;Namo Namo&quot;? Worse yet, she&#39;s thinking in terms of kaafiraanaa, despite her bringing up not admitting such concepts, much less any association thereof with hell? <br><br>Admit it, that song was supposed to appease some and shock, repulse, horrify most.
The interviewer is trying very hard to understand his answers..but failing miserably...He is totally baffled! 😂

Very intellectual comments from SSR...actually so much to learn...i can listen continuously...no comparison with current Bullywood crap actors...He was on another level 🤗<br>Its a loss of not having him.
I love Shushant sir and your smile is killing and so lovely voice
Sushant sir is always succeed
what an intellectual person he is, he can never commit suicide, he has been killed by some demons!<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsinghrajput">#JusticeForSushantSinghRajput</a>
The way He is answering ..as a science student..economics student
Watch shushant in his old interview he was look fresh..energetic and shiness ..but after kedaarnath he was looking dull shine loss fubling ..
Miss you SSR.
Mehnat kre SSR or fame le jae SARA ali khan maa choda e bullywood
Sushant jaisa koun hoga jo apne ek ek shavad ko kahte huye jeeta tha kitna positive tha sushant negativity toh use choo bhi nahi sakti.❤😢
I Love you sushant.
Great sense and simplicity , great can&#39;t forget you sushant , Rip sushant
Missed
How many of Sushant fans stil come here to feel him 😭😭😭😭😭
Miss you SSR ♥️♥️
I m still saying he was murdered.🙂
Its sad we lost a handsome,intelligent and charming person, we will always miss him
Beauty and Brain plus amazing human being with a great sense of humour-perfect man! Dream that is made of where man like Sushant exits!!
Sushanth was a class apart.
What could have been the reason for the killing of this sweet intelligent darling 😘😘😘
His intelligence is mind blowing
:):
He was a very highly intellectual Human Being.  Sad they killed him off because he was such a capable awesome actor. Really miss him so much. Justice for SSR
His voice<br>His looks <br>His personality<br>His acting<br>.. intelligence<br>.. personality<br><br>Everything just ❤️🤧 I miss u boo <br>And it&#39;s ok because nobody deserves u . U are an angel Sushant ❤️🥺
He comes across as a very intelligent, extremely knowledgeable, most well spoken and interesting person to talk to. If he were alive, he could have given us more quality content in Indian Cinema through his acting and dancing. RIP SSR
Looks like Faridoon is observing sushants  face and body  changes and thinking what&#39;s wrong with Sushant way of talking ? Is there any health problem he is facing?
He is good looking actor
Please Sir Come Back Crying 😭😭😭😭😭 Aapki Jarurat Hai
Big loss 😭😭
Apart from all his brilliance n genius ness if you’ll notice that this interview is uploaded just a year back and we’ll know what was all nonsense been happening to him with people <a href="http://around.in/">around.In</a> this interview he’s looks a bit broken inside also the charm he had is missing on his face...his lips looks more dark and his eyes too looks like he was going through all those hidden drugs n medications that was being given through his food secretly of which he didn’t know.Also he used to solve maths equations when depressed or sad seems at this time as well he’s not happy inside the reason he’s more into science that gives him some kind of healing.He was a gem we just couldn’t do anything and we lost a great soul among us. RIP to Bollywood
Each and every statement of his is So damn logical and meaningful.... one in a billion
Smart Guy. He cannot be a part of the illiterate Bollywood. No wonder he was called an outsider. ❤️❤️❤️😭😭
❤
Thank you to the youtuber for making SSR&#39;s  memories alive
SSR became an big threath for some in Bollywood, just because of his talent and his personality!!!!!!!
Justice for Sushant Singh Rajput
We lost a great actor
Sushant will always remain in our heart. Guys, do watch this beautiful tribute to Sushant Singh Rajput  at.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHj2avDj4zk">https://youtu.be/mHj2avDj4zk</a><br>And do subscribe if you like it
Faridoon AP lucky person ho ,apne Sushant se ko Karib se dekha Or uske wicharon ko suna samjha .
Sushant Singh Rajput ke Sochne ka tarika hi unique tha .kash ki Sushant  NASA chla jata .
He said he used to watch his movies only months after their release. So what about Dil Bechara? Didn&#39;t he watch it before release? Or was he waiting to watch it months after release?😢
Love you Sushant💕 Want him to come back 👍 And he will..he just showed me the picture behind him..he will come back stronger just like that
I dont know how many times I have seen this interview but it never fails to astonish me that what a wonderful man he is and the way he expresses himself through his hands. U were not meant for this wicked world
The way he explained how learning new things and learning same thing in different ways..absolutely amazing!! What a loss!!
We never meet such humble personality so sad his untimely demise
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1456">24:16</a> he ask diplomatic or such ssr said such kabhi bhi ❤️
I can&#39;t  see the  full  video <br>How can someone kill such a divine  soul <br>May u have  received the  real  position  which  only u deserve 🙏
Yar kyu chala gya yeh inni jaldi 😭😭😭😭
🔥🔥🔥🔥❤💔💔💔💔😢😢😢😢🕯🕯🕯🕯🙏🙏🙏🙏
I can listen to shushant for hours and not get bored.
The clarity of thoughts he has... mesmerizes me everytime. Hope I can have atleast a fraction of what he has. (Not referring him in past tense on purpose) You are missed, in more ways than I thought it would. 💔💫🔱🌪️ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sushantsinghrajput">#sushantsinghrajput</a>
Sushant sir jaisa multitalente  insan boliwood me dhundake bhi nahi milega, justice for ssr

SSR was brilliant human being and very handsome, intelligent and handsome compared to khans of the bollywood.  Miss you SSR. I will not ever watch another bullywood film. You were too good, pure hearted soul, bwood was jealous of you. Miss you, we will not get another you/SSR 💔
Sushant is very intelligent so Bollywood jealous of <a href="http://him.so/">him.so</a> karan johar didn&#39;t call Sushant  on his show   .karan is very poor guy and mean minded hippo .
Miss you bhai
Sushant is such an inspiration for adults as well as children!! He&#39;s so much educated!! A mastermind!! I can&#39;t imagine how much of knowledge he has within him!! Never ending luv for u my darling Sushant!! God🙏 justice soon for u darling Sushant!!❤❤❤
Is kedarnath the reason for the murder!!!!!!!@?????????
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=660">11:00</a>

Yes, You kept Mansoor with yourself but he took you with himself. You also died like him while saving others&#39; life.
Kedarnath was successful coz of SSR Sir 🥰😍<br>Not coz of so cold nepo kid charsi ...yakkkkk 😡😠🙄
Level of intellectuality 🙏
worst yr for SSR 2019. <br>for us: 2020
I can listen to his interview again and <a href="http://again.so/">again.So</a> much to learn just by listening to him.Indirectly, opens your thought process.
Extremely sad this person who had vast knowledge was killed and been eliminated
Justicia por Sushant..!
habiliten los subtitulos en español. por favor!
When India and other media houses were promoting only Sara for kedarnath,this channel anchor faridoon was giving sushant his due for this <a href="http://film.today/">film.Today</a>,when he is no more useless journalists like arnab who never promoted him when he was alive ,are earning money with his death.This anchor is dignified enough to not earn money with his death.Hats off Faridoon for giving him his due with this interview when everyone ie media houses ignored him.
He seems to be very dull, usually in his previous interview he has spark.. kuch tho gadbad ek saal se..😭
I can listen to him for hours..
Sara broke up in this time with him 🥺🥺🥺😭😭
Makes me cry when I see it. Seeing it for the third time I think. It is still, till today impossible to accept u died.
Love SSR.  The host uhhhmmmm NOT. well he treats certain people better.  I remember how the host treated Daljit Dosanjh.   Watch interview with Anuksha.  So degrading.
the interviewer is trying very hard to understand what SSR is saying.. I must say its easier for tech people to undersatnd what SSR meant.. Sorry SSR u were too good for Bollywood.. how i wish u were in better personal and professional space.
i still cannot sink in that he is no more... dont know how his family is coping up from this huge loss.. but there are still vulture people who r targeting the family instead....
Beauty with brain he has. Miss you and your acting ssr sir
And, also you are one of the very rare interviewers, that seem pleasant, interesting and dignified at the same time.
IN PLAIN WORDS, SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT IS A RARE GEM, ONE OF A KIND. HE COULD DO ANY ROLE WITH EASE &amp; PASSION. NO PERSON IN BULLYWOOD CAN EVEN COME CLOSE TO HIM EVEN IN THE NEXT CENTURY.
He would&#39;ve shone as a director.....had he be given that chance!!
Coding is actually prophecy by SSR which kids are already actively involved in now....
Sushant is head and shoulders above any other actor from Hollywood or Bollywood. Every observation and comment he makes, he sounds like an engineer and scientist that he was . i wonder if any of his grlfriends or friends really understood his brilliant mind.Very heartbreaking that his life ended this way.
U r so great. Why did u leave us so early love u dear. Miss u. Justice for ssr

On the world 🌎 miss big hero 🦸‍♂️ excellent good actor like Sushant no body doing acting dance to but now on the world 🌎 never watch the movies 🎥 boycott the Bollywood,
Looks like he is going to burst out a tear and wail , once faridoon leaves, you can see he was not in good shape at all 😔
Words are not sufficient to describe you how fabulous your are sushanth <br> Host —not for your standard at all —atleast he cud not manage his face experience ..he was blank on ur intelligence <br>God if u have created such a great person ..why u not let him live more to do more wonders <br>Hope ur death will not go I vein wll fight as much we can
If u learn more;it will take a less time to learn more .. what a observation he had .really  miss him a lot 🙏
The only bollywood actor with zero haters
Acting ke bare me itni knowledge in nepo jockers me he kya....
At start , he says his character also act in front of his co- characters,  this man was fucking genius.  RIP😢
You were more like Mansoor. &#39;Amrit sabhi main baatke, pyaala vish ka tune khud piya&#39; :(
He said he is a paradox. I guess he was right. People must listen to this full interview if you love him.
I love this interview a lot. His perspective of different things were so unique and interesting. Thank you for this masterpiece. This tells quite a lot about the person Sushant Shingh Rajput.
He was very happy till this time. In 2019 things changed after sarah left him. And 2020 lets not talk about it.
sushant is the best actor sorry was the best actor.
Superb  He has portraid Mansoors character very well. I have witnessed such men in those hill stations they r innocent to the core and behave with a subdued character  He is a replica of my pantry chef in Srinagar. These mountain men r very straight in life
What happened to him here ?
SSR and his physics language💞❣🙂 love you forever..!!
What a fab person Sushant gosh will miss u
Kitna acha tha yaar ye ladka... humne kho diya isey, ye boht kuch kar sakta tha India k liye 💔💔💔💔
He is looking quite normal in this ...quite logical...there is no sign of depression
Sushant Is A Legend by all means ! ... Good natured , Honest , Smart , Intelligent , Handsome &amp; A Gentleman ! . He stole the shows so effortlessly . So precious light being . Unbelievable to believe Bollywood’s saga that brought about his lose . No matter what no  one will like him . He is the One only Sushant Singh Rajput ! ✨🎩👌🕊🕺🕯💕💕
Wow.... Wow...<br>Mind it m just writing this comment in middle of video.. to be precise at past <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1080">18:00</a> minutes.<br>And this was like 1.8 hrs of experience already...<br>So much knowledge so much narratives n explanation...<br>What have you done bollywood...😭😭<br>We are gonna miss this forever... But you will  reside in our heart,mind &amp; memories always...😖😟😞<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#justiceforSSR</a> ❤️❤️❤️🙏
What an interesting and intellectual interview about Kedarnath. Simply spontaneous answers to the questions. Sushant&#39;s was a gifted with over brilliance and intelligence by God.
Brother, I&#39;ll miss you... Your biggest fan. The World will miss you. The World has boycotted Bollywood and we&#39;ll ensure that this industry collapses and the perpetrators and murderers die a painful death. We&#39;ve captured you in our hearts and this New India will maul those criminals. Rest in peace. We love you and we will miss you forever. You were the best that ever was and you&#39;ll remain the best that will ever be.
Sush ❣a force to be reckoned with..
Faridoon looks soo impressed with ssr intelligence ❤❤❤❤
Listen from 10 .00 min to 12.00, he knew everything in advance which we are facing now. How amazing he was.,! We lost a gem😭😭
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Please come back Sushant
Great interview! Loved his way of speaking so intelligently! Can&#39;t believe he is no more! Rest in peace Sushant! U r in a better place in heaven above
He was a gifted child!They are usually well above average and are not a general class.
He was a gifted child!They are usually well above average and are not a general class.
It all started from kedarnath...... Look at him
This interviewer is way too dumb to talk to Sushant. I mean look at his expressions. Sushant’s answers are going above his head.
He seems sad I think after this movie Sara ali khan broke up with him
RHEA CHAKRABORTY SHOULD BE ARRESTED 😡😡😠😠😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
We need to sit together nit fight together.... correlations n causation...... and so n so on ...... just sad ☹️ sushant was a sweetheart
😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔
He is so intelligent. Such a loss. A beautiful soul a beautiful person. So humble. Love him and miss him so much
He is so much better than any other Actor out there. Will miss him so much
Kaha itna brilliant insaan ek 2 kaudi ki tuchi ldki k chakar mai pdd gya! We miss you Sush! You will always stay in our hearts! You&#39;re eternal!
Faridoon was only one who listened to Sushant and  tried to understand his intellectual talks.......Other journalists like Komal Nahta and  Rajiv Masand  always  criticised him ,never   valued  his talent.
One of my favourite interview of sushant. . Very intelligent, brilliant and a genius person I have ever seen ❤️❤️❤️
Plz come back 😭
Miss you ssr so much 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Really miss him 🤦‍♀️
Faridoon how lucky you are that you got to meet him and experience his passion in person. I hope you also missing him..
Miss you sushant sir
How can no one see how depressed he looks here
RIP Sushant... Return If Possible 🙏🙏🙏
And youtube is recommending me this video of SSR, when he&#39;s no more.. 💔 Wish he gets justice, now just want to see his killers behind bars 🙏🏻🔥
This man is my entire heart 💘. I can assure this he can never commit suicide. SSR is heart,he is literally a true Legend ❤💯
He is such kind of intellctual person,that we have ever seen,..his every answer is unparallel,,i think so called bollywood heroes will not understand at all his explanation..his level is sooo high,so calked kapoors n khans are far away .......to understand it.......
The person taking interview seems clueless and I wonder does he understand Sushant&#39;s reply
Such an intellectual n knowledgeable person can&#39;t commit suicide. Wish he be surrounded by intellectual people, he would have alive today n shinning somewhere else where u worth to be. Ur talks n thoughts took everyone to somewhere else. U will be missed forever 😢 Hope u have reborned to lead another great life 🙌
All changed in a <a href="http://year.so/">year.So</a> fit and enthusiastic here.  Coming together did not work for SSR, Sorry and Sad.
Superbly intelligent person. We are going to miss you forever and ever.
Now coding is added in NEP
I&#39;m falling in love with him more I see
He had so much potential as an artist  to contribute to indian cinema... sushant says in this interview that he loves acting so much,he could come back as a GHOST to continue his love for acting.......BEWARE ,YOU MURDERERS.
he&#39;s right....what difference would there be in calling him trump or mansiur ali....there are many mansur alis and many trumps.....as simple as that...ha ha.
KADERNATH... was the most enjoyable hindi movie ....a simple love story  set  amidst the breath taking rugged,snow capped mountains in all its glory, and the everflowing glacial river meandering through the most picturisque vally dotted with pretty hamlets and wayside stalls...best of all ,the charactors in the movie gave their best natural and spontaneouse acting ,highlighted by the dashing mansur ali&#39;s love for   sarah ali khan. She  exudes  a magical  freshness  as a newcomer  in her first movie and gives a natural performance.<br>justice for sushant.
He was just not an actor, he was a leader - crores of rupees donation, supporting orphanage, opened company ...
Sushant,was a brilliant,he is explaining the facts of life with science,wow,not too many people like him in the world<br>Bollywood didn&#39;t deserve him,he should have taken the scholarship from Stanford University and work for NASA or some tech companies in the US and would have make salary in million dollars,like sunder pichai, he is graduated from Stanford University an being CEO of google making salary in million dollars,<br>His biggest mistake ever going to Bollywood and another biggest mistake was getting involved with evil rhea
I think even the interviewer was amazed by sushants intelligence and his charm..miss you Sushant 😢😢
Miss you Sushant...Sara you lost someone who truly genuinely loved you..
U were the best....I wish if I could  meet u ...how much talented a person can be...after watching ur interviews I can not put anyone in ur place u..were the person who cannot be compared to any Bollywood actors..
Intelligent, confident, intellectual,
This interview is a must watch for everyone
SSR you were very good guy but unfortunately got in contact with wrong folks
Gentle man SSR
I miss you sushan
Exactly! That&#39;s the reason I am sure that those wanted him out. What intellectual conversations soo many lucky people have had with him. He would have definitely clearly without any major effort, been the next top actor and whatever else he would have ventured into...it would have been just a little bit of time...and he would have been there...soiled sport was this corona in the literary sense and the other Corona...the ones who did what they did to him..
Guys just see how he already predicted that coding would be the next big thing. And now see you will that WhiteHat Jr. have started advertising it daily and Byju have taken them over. He predicted this 2 years ago😭😭😭😭 Miss you SSR💖❤️💫✨🌪️🔱
Hello Faridun, don&#39;t you think he had &#39;ganja&#39; before the interview?
He is real man and humble boy.
His mind not same like Bollywood fake actors. He is really good thinker.
I would have loved to have him as my friend. he was so conversant, can talk on anything in the world and make it an interesting topic.
What a beautiful mind he had! We have lost a  genious!
He said he&#39;s looking forward to the next interview 😭😭😭😭
What a brilliant mind!!!India has lost a great soul.
Nice, Sushant is definitely an intelligent sensitive human being. It is a big loss that he is no more. So much good could have happened through him.
His face changes here <br>seriously why he hv to show his dayagiri to that fattu rhea!!! Bestfren of saraa khaan <br>m muzzled!
Main hmesha sochta tha ki kyun Inhe  <br>Koffee with Karan mein nhi bulate the ab pta chala ki inki aadhi baatien tho uske mathe se upar se jaati!! <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23highlyintelectual">#highlyintelectual</a> he was the best!!!
Jo interview lerahahai it is going up his head 😂 thora intelligent hona padta hai to understand his logistics.
“Science does not deal in philosophy, science deals on maths”! Well said brother! Be in peace
I wish he was alive, such knowledgeful person he was. When he spoke about kids learning coding, i felt Goosebumps, the kids coding online class is currently booming. Looks like he has seen the future.
Dear Philosopher may you rest in peace
Sushant ❤
Sushant sabhi ki tarif kar rha h fir bhi koi uske liye nhi bola na salman,na preeti zinta koi nhi..
Rhea drug addict bta rhi h par Sushant to rapid fire me lassi chunta h
Ye banda itna intelligent tha or salle khud ko bachne ke liye depression bta rhe h or pagal bta rhe h
From Dec 2018  till his death all videos were filled with comments pointing out his change in look, voice etc.  <br><br>I still remember the troll he got at that time.... These Social media bullies even used comments like &#39; Drug user&#39;.
His face looks tired ,look his face at the time of raabta and now
Justice for sushant sir 🙏🙏<br>Boycott Bollywood
God’s gift truly ❤️❤️
He used to understand and analyze acting skills like physics equations.<br>His intellect was way above than what most people can even comprehend. 💛💛💛💛
He is so intelligent. How did he end up with Rhea ?  I don’t understand.he is so straightforward and very Genuine.
Itne achhe insaan ko maar diya....Kaisa world hai ye???
I could watch and listen to him for hours...  Rip beautiful soul...  You soul is where it belongs, You were not meant for this world.
Genuine
Still don’t understand why they killed this innocent gentlemen.  Such high level talk.  Also, just don’t understand how could he like senseless Rhea.
He  is a best Actor natural real  and smile all the time speak well over all best , I don&#39;t watch Bollywood films much but  If  sushant flim I don&#39;t missed it
This anchor is he looks cynical
Miss u lovely handsome brilliant ssr
Coward Ass soul
all praises to all those good comments whose time is &gt;  4 months
Always loved you and Will always love you Sushant ❤️
What an intelligent interview by Sushant, how knowledgeable and prompt answers. He is really over and above with his skills. Not anyone in Bollywood would be able to give such a flow of talks and IQ. Will miss SSR forever.
Bc of his extreme intelligence, he simply understood someone’s dirty secret in Bollywood and they murdered him.
God...he was so intelligent...total misfit in Bollywood ......such a loss....
bollywood didn’t deserve him. he was just too good for it
Humble personality...Ria k hat ane se pehele APNA documents leker Bina bole Bihar /USA kahi v nikal jate .Unko khatra feel hua tha,Feer V.....Ku so called LOGO se dur nehi hue ap ,, APNA pitaji k pass help milta apko surely.. phone off Koro,disconnect ho Jao,why Susant??? AJ ap hamare sath hote,6/7 months apne ko dur Ku nehi Kia faltu LOGO se..
Sala es duniya me acche log jaldi mar jaate hai rhea randi aur tera team bhagwan tujko jarur saja degi
Each time I watch his interviews, I fall in love with him more and more..Brilliant man ♥️
To become the target of such powerful people(who are manipulative enough to move freely for 60-70 days after crime) one needs to be Sushant Singh Rajput!!!🔥
Such a cool guy, you people really believe he commit suicide, they murdered him, fu......  Bollywood nepotism 😤😤😠😠😡😠😠
Still can&#39;t understand 😪 why such a beautiful person had to killed badly when all he spread is love
Culprits have taken you away from us SSR... Will never forgive those culprits
SSR ne bahut achha acting kiya. SSR, aapko yeh duniya bahut miss karega. aap ko jorurat hai for good people. Plzz lout ke ayo.
You can sit and listen to him for hours. He was so charismatic, so talented and it is such a pity that some people took advantage of the purity of his soul and brutally mardered  him and lost his life.<br>At the moment I do not know what hurts the most The loss or the thought that he was tortured😔
If one could see the future...some bad things could&#39;ve been changed
Why people had done such harm to him
Faridoon be like ,..... Mere ko kuch samj kyu nahi aa raha 🤔😜 ,..... Bithways Appreciation For Sushant , Iski baatein Genius level ki thi 👍👍
What to say Sushant sir...??? You were amazing...<br><br> Wow.. He is an aquarian too.. We shared the same zodiac and that why I felt as I know more about him I feel more of similarities.. Not an intellect I am though.. Alot of his thoughts about the world is something much as mine.. (Edited after the listening to the end part of the interview.. )

His ways of thinking is very sensitive, unique, extraordinarily intelligent ,a man wth a great potential who could have contributed to raise the level of humanity into another level not only in terms of his acting but looks like mystic,scientist,innovative technologies,. He was definitely  a Gem whom we lost. He was very very far greater than ordinary nepo kids. A great loss to humanity not only for INDIA BUT FOR THE ENTIRE GLOBE.
It&#39;s more about coming together not competing!
Anchor is so patient and trying to understand his views
He is a fantastic teacher
So much depth, your place was in Stanford, Oxford or Hollywood, not at Shi* Bollywood full of animals
Audience loved the moments with Mansoor and Mukku,
Miss you so much Sushant. Thinking of you each and everyday. 💔💔😥 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsinghrajput">#justiceforsushantsinghrajput</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23warriors4ssr">#Warriors4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23godiswithus">#Godiswithus</a>
Listening to a genius! He is my Institution for life!❤️
He answered most of the questions by taking reference from science. True science lover. He had cut short some of his answers due to limited time otherwise he had so much to say. In this interview he also shed some light on importance of coding and education for children.
Aise log crores mein ek hotein hai woh ek hee sushant hain
Interviewer seems clueless about sushant&#39;s deep intellect.
He said if I die I will move around as ghost tgats why he likes horror movies
Miss u great actor, gt human being sushant
seems sad and not well internally ..🥺
Namo namo truly define his character
Faridoon bhi sochte honge ish actor ke liye questions kitne different type ke aate hai baaki actors se.
OMG pure interview mein sushant ki baatein samajhti rahi is interview ko aaram se dekho aur suno warna kuch samajh nahi aayega.<br>Mujhe iski mind brilliance samajh mein aa gaya rhea ko yeh paagal dikh raha tha ab toh mujhe lagta hai rhea ka mental chekup karaao bahut bada garbar ghotala niklega.  Rhea mein intelligence ka I bhi nahi tha or ish brilliant ladke ko depression ke medicines deti thi.  <br>Paagal crack ladki. I can&#39;t understand this type of girls . Ladkiyon ke naam par dhabba hai.
From today...I won&#39;t apply ..was with Sushant..he..is.. always with us..how a person can be so brilliant..and vulnerable..and saddened..not ..had a true or same calibre mind lover.. May God bless you.. create a fairy..who is as beautiful and unique as you are...
“”Genre as ‘horror’ and can have Sequel as a ghost... “” and we all know now. He was wrong.. he is a true aquarian.
He somewhat looks sick... eyes voice skin. Or just woke up from sleep.@ifaridoon sir was he under the weather when you took this interview?
Everything he says ... in movies, in interviews... is prophetic of his death. Most of his characters die at the end... so many of his interviews are prophecies... like this one, if there was a movie to be made about him, which genre (25.44) and he says &quot;Horror... I can play a ghost...&quot; and what is he doing right now in Spirit? Urging all of us to shed the light on his horrific death? Sushant, I don&#39;t know what to tell you other than... could you have not chosen to stay on a little more and die differently? I know your answer, but all of this, listening to things like this are just so heart-wrenching. Like rubbing salt in the wound, the open gaping wound of your untimely and most unnatural death.
Such a beautiful, innocent person, tears in my eyes. He has no hatered to anyone. Why Bollywood biggies were jealous of him to such an extent that made him to f dg is appear permanently from this earth. I hope that are happy now.

at 17 mins. into the video, he talks about science is maths .. it is true. <br>intelligent Rajput !
Whenever i watch SSR interview, i learn something from him. It really hurt so deep inside my heart that he left too soon. Its big loss for country.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sushantwasmurdered">#SushantWasMurdered</a>
This video must be shot in his house
I hate all of them for not standing for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ssr">#SSR</a> case earlier but still I have a huge respect for Bollywood hungama host for only one thing that he always respect <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ssr">#SSR</a> knowledge and his hardwork. <br>He asked apt questions for him. <br>and Wondered by his intelligence.
I can listen to him on and on and on....he&#39;s such a profound intellectual yar😭😭
Why do I feel hostility in the host&#39;s behavior ???  Sad.. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#justiceForSSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23warriors4ssr">#warriors4SSR</a>
His thinking is too deep....I luv his brain
&quot;If a movie is made on you, what genre would it be?&quot;<br>&quot;Horror.. because i want sequals.. even when i die, i can play ghost!&quot;<br>How i wish he had turned into a ghost &amp; return to haunt &amp; revenge those who had hands on his sudden unnatural death.
Humbleness is an another name of Sushant... We really miss such a gem of a person 😢
Boycott nepotism boycott mafia films boycott entire bollywood
Super star!
The background had the same shiva panting that he drove..
SSR is the soul of the movie - didn’t get credit which he deserved
Don&#39;t get me wrong dear SSR fans, he is amazing however just (unbiasedly) watch this video carefully - he is all over the place. You guys/ Like he is jumping from a straight one line answer to a philosophical 2 minute answer. This happens when we consume more than we create (Consumption vs Creation). When you read or watch more than you actually expend those thoughts in creating something, you end up talking like this. Just watch again guys, he is talking about too many things at a time. Medicines or not, something was going on inside that mind of his. His thoughts are all over the place and it&#39;s not stable. I feel bad that he got isolated from his real family otherwise he could have gotten help.
poor child was a total misfit in narcissistic and ignorant bollywood!
He was such a jinius,jem of a person,v.pure soul, should get Peace,❤️
there&#39;s a scar on his right side of head, which wasnt there before
This LEGEND SSR always taught so much through his interviews, movies tweets.. Atleast now may his fellow colleagues learn something from this LEGEND...
I the first few minutes ,The question mark on Faridoon’s face is unmistakable!!! It’s like “ dude what are you even talking about ??” !! <br>Glad the movie did well . Wish he got an equal or larger ( being senior) part in promos and success parties! <br>Lots of love Sushant !!
Iss choot Faridoon (garibo ka Himesh Reshammiya) ko kuch palle hi nahi pad raha hai Sushant ki baatein.<br><br>Causation vs correlation, language getting standardised in the form of coding, Rate of change vs invention etc.
Love 💗 the schrodinger t-shirt 🌟..<br>Absolute genius <br>We lost a gem 💎🙏😔🌹
He did so many interviews at his house
I am extremely sorry for India peoples who loose such a talented person ,😢
honestly i wasn&#39;t a big fan of sushant. it feels like this is a loss to  humanity.Such a humble and bright intelligent person he was .... bollywood is total plastic.... we as audience we are so use to plastic heroes that we failed to recognize such a gem amid us. Humongous loss to planet Earth. He is gone to some other planet and living life king Size.
i find a new definition of intelligent &amp; talent... just 3 words.. Sushant Singh Rajput
I m just blown away by his presence of mind. What we lost we also can&#39;t determine.
love you sushant
He was way to smart for bollywood. I wish he had completed the engineering. He could have been successful in any field.
Rhea should face capital punishment.
After watching hundreds of interviews of his , i can tell he is not okay here .. Can somebody find out when this interview happened? And if he was taking any meds at that time given by rhea!!
Yaar kafi movie mi last death hue h.
I feel sorry . I know him form manav ... <br>But didn&#39;t give him that much attention as I should given him . All the time I was fan of Salman Khan .
He is so so intelligent but among idiots he was misplaced and may be he accepted riya a duffer as source of entertainment but she high flier played a game
Brilliant..Miss you ..RIP❤💔❤🙏🙏
Such a smart chap.. love you Sushant 😢
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1173">19:33</a> &quot;no skill&quot; indirectly for those dumb nepo kids..
Sushant was genius and highly qualified....he is unique guy
We lost such a beautiful charmer 🔱🕉😍😍😘😘😞
Why he is so much upset
ऑखों में नमी हांसी लवो पर<br> क्या हाल है क्या दिखा रहे हैं <br>क्या गम है जिसको छिपा रहे हो । ♥️
Very intelligent 👌 👍 👏 person <br>All bollywood actar and actress Very dumb 🙄 stupid 🙄 i hate them all bashtar mafia family&#39;s not everyone 😑
Who killed him 😤 🤧 😕 <br>We can&#39;t forget him
He was so clear intelligent crying crying crying
Such an unfortunate thing a good guy meets viciously cunning folks <br>-rhea <br>-sandip Singh <br>-pithani <br>And so on ... <br>hope all of them rot in hell!
Such a rare combination of talent looks and passion
Genius
Damn !!!!!  Looooovveee  the image he projects in his talks.... so scientific ... so mathematics (thumbs up)
Big bannn or big band.....will never happen
Will u please share qaafirana song video with shushant sir....if u had
He talked about coding 1 year ago. Now look at the newly introduced education system.
Wish never happened Big Bang.
Rest well bhai ❤️ 😔 🤗
Sushant = ∞
The way he explaines everything!!  Excellent!!  Ppl call him mentally weak, shd watch this video!!
Its his own house
omg Sush, tell us. wht hapnd to you pls??
Genuine and intelligent talk.. not even a single time did i felt that he is showing off like most other actors.. saying things beyond movies though sticking it to the point... Great soul.
I have never seen someone from acting profession so diversely interested in all types of subjects...from emotional intelligence, to Albert Einstein, Man... his wisdom was so profound...Academic world of India probably lost a brilliant gem..who can be the face intelligent  India in the world of 21 st century . Moreover, his untimely demise seems more and more personal every now on then. Be forever happy wherever you are...may be smiling upon us from Andromedea Galaxy..,  Orion constellation...Miss your infectious  Exuberance, effortless talking and charming disposition.....you will be forever alive in our mind!!!!!!!!!
just look at the intro carefully..he is trying to control his tears..
This man can never be in depression and him committing suicide is just not possible . Love you man
If a movie was made on him, his answer might be a &quot;Horror&quot; movie titled &quot;Paradox&quot;
SSR😢💔
He would&#39;ve been very happy with this education policy change
Love u miss u Sush...
Do anyone notice....He is wearing a tshirt on which Schrödinger&#39;s smile is written.... By seeing this we can understand that how intellectual he was!! He aware of all concepts of physics and astronomy... Not only touchup but deep knowledge about it!!. <br>He was also learning Android programming in these lockdown days! And developing a mobile app for us! <br>He was a great coder..!! <br>He was a great gamer!! <br>He was a great philanthropist! <br>He was  a great man! <br>He donated crores of money in kedarnath flood!! Without any publicity! <br>He was kind to all! <br>We will always miss u sushant!! 😭🙏🏻<br>Rip sir!
He was so much in a single body.<br>I don&#39;t know if we ever deserved him.<br>I hope wherever you are you are happy and at peace.♥️<br>All of what you&#39;ve said will keep enlightening us and the coming generations.<br>Miss you always.
Sushant aap engineering continue karlete 💋💋💋💋 the fake world of Bollywood was not for you! Bloody genius
i wish that u come back to see how much we love brother Sushant ... May Allah have mercy on ur soul
And now indian government made coding compulsory form class 6
Indian govt should follow his ideas to develop our education system.
To understand his statements , you&#39;ve to go deeper and deeper.
Its entire Bollywood&#39;s loss.
A VERY RARE AUTHENTIC COMBINATION OF VIRTUES N INTELLECT For the very 1st time from the emerge of Film industry. Period. Was of high value in an average people of industry.
The Big Bang 👌👌🤣🤣🤣🤣
SRK k bad SSR dusra hai jiske paas itna knowledge hai bollywood me ..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1544">25:44</a>😭😭😭😭
Omg....so much of intelligence...  very difficult to understood ur level of intelligence...you are superstar dude
SUCH AN EXTREMELY TALENTED INTELLIGENT PERSON FULL OF HUMILITY <br><br>WE HAVE LOST A GEM ...<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23arrestculpritsofssr">#ArrestCulpritsOfSSR</a> 🙏
I don&#39;t think such a deep thinker with that level of knowledge can commit suicide. Lot if things are being hidden under the carpet.
Analyzing and experiencing .....wow
Probably the one of the best interviews.....people couldn’t handle this much of intellect of this visionary guy.....<br>I love the way faridoon interviewed sushant. I feel you always asked him relevant questions n tried to see the real guy behind the actor.
Recently I hv re-watched many of his interviews again &amp; I hv cracked it dt why he had only few frnds bcs Bollywood is full of dump, class dropout ir failure Nepo kids, so they could not stand his knowledge, they knew he will overshine them.. So they did not include him in Karan house get together or, Farah khan Sunday lunch get-together
My  gooood what a gem we &#39;ve lost,not solo you India but entire world,i love this diamond brain,was most brilliant for this mediocre world.i am &#39;&#39;jealous &#39;&#39;for the stars who talk him now.  Ciao da Roma SUSH !!!!
Schrodinger&#39;s smiley-both sad and happy at the same time.. he was really into physics. Why man...why?? You were doing so great and then this... We need closure.
I love uuu sushant plz come back...i dont want live without uuu....
I love this interviewer. <br>also I don&#39;t know another actor with so much knowledge and depth of thinking .
What an intelligent man.but v v sensitive.down to earth. Very handsome.nazar lag gai.badi buri nazar.
Fucking bollywood brutes did it all to sushant  . Matlab usko pressurize  kar rahe the. Aur saale  sushant ki sab  films cheen rahe the . Karan johar ****u
Love you Sushant❤
Every question he answered so good in explaning way , just outstanding. Best answer was about negative article &#39;measure the length of article.&#39;
He always trying  applying present life situation in method way... in Economics our lectures r trying to say that .... u don&#39;t think Economics is subject... it&#39;s ur lyf... if apply every situation wh hpnd in ur lyf... it&#39;s Economics... might be v r interested 2 do that.... but he does... anything hpnd in universe he thinks scientifically, Economically, psychologically... implied that formula logically...he had believe in trying 2 learn new things... u r great physicist... he knows everything but he always &quot;I don&#39;t know anything&quot;... C hw he had applied correlation casuation &quot;when two variables fluctuate each other...it may causes  each other... he simply implied in it...<br>Trying to educate plpe wid his analogy... grt humanitarian by dng help 2 poor nd needy plpe.... innocent, humble, decent person.... I nvr had seen anyone lyk him ...down 2 earth... respect...he calls his interviwers &quot;sir&quot; and &quot;mam&quot;... being a super star, he may not need to call dem... no one can&#39;t reach u in any aspect... v call him &quot;super star&quot; not only for films... wt he had done for society, intelligence, for his beautiful dreams, work for free education,  help for needy plpe without any publicity...v sad part, v get know all ur humanitarian thoughts after ur demise... u will b missed bro...
When I saw this interview I wanted to question him why did he do this?
V have lost a brilliant intellectual human being who .......WILL haunt d uneducated n stupid starkids.... eternally.....  !!!!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bollywood">#bollywood</a> sucks n it&#39;s mafia will perish slowly n steadily....!!!!
He was murdered it wasn&#39;t a suicide! So much hope for life and tasks he planned to... Such a hopeful character can never do that. Above all no suicide note... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushant">#JusticeforSushant</a>
I have respect for sharyar because he treated SSR so respectfully otherwise I have noticed everyone used to bully and insult him
Each and every word was meaningful.Miss him badly.Divya bharati and sushant cases are same.coz both of them knew something big abt this industry.If ssr case is sloved lot of unanswered questions will solve.
His level of introspection is amazing and infectious ...its urging and compelling me to think and comprehend things around me in a different way...<br>People and critics did the big mistake of trying to fit him in the typical bollywood hero box...he was clearly a misfit and we love him that way...
Perfect host... perfect guest...both are really well aware, having respect for each other&#39;s knowledge... wonderful to see them hear them...
Thank you for this interview. Thank you for asking all the right questions to Sushant. Thank you for being patient and letting him complete his thoughts and sentencesn
Wooow his knowledge about Education and future technology
His eyes and his smile was really attractive.. But more than that his brillant mind was so fascinating. ❤️❤️ you will be missed deeply sush<br>💔💔💔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1357">22:37</a> you can see the sadness in his eyes when he was talking about his struggle. Star kids would never understand this.
When he was alive I didn&#39;t followed him much.... but when he is no more I started watching his movies , interviews....then I realized he was a fantastic artist with treasure of knowledge, good communication skill n attractive <br><br><br>Today I&#39;m praying to god his culprit should get highest punishment
I would like to watch his theater shows how and where can we watch them?
I think shushant ki koi bhi bath is usko samaj nahi aa rahi hai but wo aisa dikha raha hai ki usko bhoth samaj raha hai
Shushant bhoth intelligent hai .
What a man, to understand his talks a person need full concentration, then you will be blown up, every situation he relates with logical equation. &quot;Co-relation aur Causation alag cheezein hoti hai&quot;
Very meaningful answers , from the very first answer he delivers intelligent interpretation..a big loss for the industry  the brain &amp; heart  has gone with Sushant, only corpse is left behind
O god , why u took him too soon from us, there is lot of things to know from him ,he was a ocean of knowledge, intelligence,an humantarian. He was such a gentleman with golden heart . I&#39;m a big big big fan of urs sushant ❤..No one can be like u sush , u r replacable champ❤.u will be always alive in my heart ❤. I &#39;m just keep watching ur video on rpeats ,still i can&#39;t able to accept that u r no more with us nd seriously this is so painful for everyone💔💔💔😖😖😖
We lost the precious gem! 💫💫The way he thinks hits right at heart ❤️
Great mind gone
Sooo REAL... sooo TRUE...soooo PURE was HE...❤YOU SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsinghrajput">#JUSTICEFORSUSHANTSINGHRAJPUT</a> 🇮🇳
❤❤❤❤❤❤🌹🇮🇳
It&#39;s a clear murder.. Ssr never commit suicide.. They are all laying. They murder our real hero. 😢💔💔💔
Sushant&#39;s point of view is amazingly beautiful. Love u always!
There are several things I have noticed in this interview.They are:-<br>1) For the first 10mins Faridoon has completely no idea what Sushat is speaking.<br>2) Sushant must have been  extremely intelligent and had a huge amount of knowledge in various fields otherwise how can he speak so well at all the questions thrown at him?<br>3) No words ...simply no words for all his answers! Very very smart, educated, knowledgeable answers..! What was he doing in this fools world of Bollywood? He deserved much much more than he got in his lifetime.
Sushant sir 😭😭😭😭😭😭🕯
I love his voice heis example for good man ,actor

So true <br>..COVID IS THE BIGGEST UNKNOWN  FACTOR TO HIT US ...HE PREDICTED   UNKNOWNS
I am here after his “murder”
SSR - Horror movie because Even if i die, i can play as ghost..I want sequel😪😪😪😪 every time I hear it, i am in tears.. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23aliveinheartsforeverssr">#Aliveinheartsforeverssr</a>
Kitne innocent ho, kitne genuine ho yaar .. simple  attitude se baat karte ho..koi arrogance nahi.. fir  aap k sath hi aise  Kyu ... Sushant hi kyu  😢 ... ? Where are you.. 🥺😢 ab kaise dekhenge apko .. kaha dhudhenge apko Sushant 😢 plz come back 🥺😢
Aur kabhi bhi ek new interview nehi dekh paungi , firse kabhi aise words nehi sun paungi 😔😔😔😔
From 14 June till today, one thing I m watching, only Sushant&#39;s interviews on YouTube.
Faridoon treats every actor respectfully kudos to him🙏
Such a wonderful, great,humble , golden hearted person he is 💕( was 😢)<br> I am European so i didn&#39;t know so much about him , but i&#39;ve seen his few movies and i found him very good actor. But i&#39;ve never thought who he really is. This interview ( and many others what i was watching with him ) showed me he was a diamond in this world. Huge loss 😢<br>I hope he will get justice after all what happened with him 😢<br>Fly high dear Sushant ❤
Who killed him .and why such an person  .
Bahut bol Gaya SSR in this interviews. He wanted to achieve more with the world experiencing his good work. He was honest in his output. SRK N SK BOTH NOW ARE NOT TO BE MENTIONED ANYWHERE
U can see the difference between his interviews nd Ranveer, Ranbir
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1780">29:40</a> he clearly says don’t be perplexed by negative publicity and trolls, I fail to understand what happened to him during his last days.
His death is the most wished desire of Bollywood mafias and I can clearly name that Bastard Karan Johar as their leader because he deliberately didnt ever invite him on Koffee with Bastard owing to the popularity of the show as it would have exhibit sheer excellence of his personality amongst public and public would have discovered this precious gem in an easier way.
Such a good interview by Faridoon  Shahryar of Sushant Singh Rajput. I think the questions are so balanced and the answers are so well thought of. I love the line &quot;ignorance cannot stop the inevitable&quot;.
Anchor is astonished about his knowledge
His emotional intelligence, depth, humbleness, eye for detail, curiosity to know things, want to contribute into people&#39;s lives, genuinity, knowledge, witty humour, ability to achieve any goal through focus and hardwork, love and myriad of compassion makes him such a gem in this oh so materialistic world. Nothing he does (I say does coz his impact still lives) is for the heck of doing or to satiate any obligation or formality but because he genuinely wants to do it. How often do we have humans like that? Sadly, how often do we rightly value humans like that? I mean while they are here. Big love to the man who will always have a piece of our hearts in his name. Sending good energy to his angelic soul:)
He seemed sad ,tired and not well.but naturally intelligent and well studied mature than before.feel so sad this was only a year back he should have stayed with loving family this time.
Faridoon genuinely liked him
Faridoon was awestruck from the intellect of sushant. The way he explained or given that interview, if god comes and tell me he did suicide, i will not believe god. I am convinced that he has been murder. I was not his fan but did watch his movies. Still i was taken aback hearing the news of his demise. Om shanti Sushant
What a great Actor talented Actor justice for
We lost such a talented actor
I love sushant n<br>Qafirana song
Was that his mind or Google 💓
Faridoon Shahryar I have seen you do many interviews for SSR and you always were so supportive of him. Thank you.
You are such a great speaker Sushant Bhai !So convincing! Proud of you. Its pleasure listening to you. You create deep interest in Science in the viewers! Your interviews should be seen by every high school and collegiates. I&#39;m damn sure Sushant Bhai that they will know that this talented star is a very good Scholar too. I have great respect for You owing to your rich treasure of knowledge. Keep Reading is the message from him to us all.<br>Om Namah Shivay!
Sushant we all love you We want justice and CIB enquiry for Sushant Singh Rajput
Can you imagine Varun, Shidarth Malhotra, Tiger Schroff, Ranveer or any of these so called star&#39;s even trying to explain &amp; talk like this? He was too good for Bollywood. Will miss him forever 😢💔
Oh so sad. Can&#39;t believe that you are no more! 😢😢😢😢 Such an intelligent and talented boy. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushtsinghrajput">#justiceforsushtsinghrajput</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbi4sushantsinghrajput">#CBI4sushantsinghrajput</a>
Great Sushant Singh God have given you great success in this world which shows God love towards you ... I hope God loves you after ur death as well and forgive all ur sins 😘
I used to wonder y he&#39;s never been on koffee with karan, but lukin at his intellectual level, dumb kjo would never have understood his answers
I feel Mr.Faridoon is having bouncers  in this interview
Bahaut dard mein tha Sushant <br>Kitna pareshaan kiya unn haraamiyo uski dard bhari aawaaz se aur aankhon se iss interview mein saaf pata chala raha hain 💔<br>Bhagwaan agr hoga toh unn sab ko punish krega brutally jinne iss intelligent aur beautiful soul ko maar daala <br>I love u 💝
Just wonderful
I can just said He is brilliant God Bless Him
Lagrehehi this interview abi ho rehe hai, miss you lovely inteligent smart guy,
What a intelligent boy he is. Who more I watch his interview or video who more I learn him.....every words what he is says can think in different ways. He was from science student but how he explain his thoughts or Facts is comes from philosophy and science together,....it is amazing, science and arts together is making a new section.....His IQ is unbelievable high, in  bollywood filmindustry nobody has so  IQ as him.....Sushant, you leave way too early......we miss you...
His IQ and EQ (which is clearly reflecting in this interview ) is more than that of the entire Bollywood combined.
Faridoon is trying hard to understand what Sushant is talking about..... SSR was ( use of this word give me pain) beyond intelligence......<br>Jahan sabki soch khatam hoti hai.... Sushant ki shuru hoti thi.
I wish I could protect you on that day...
seen this interview feel like u are here and will see u more n  grt work in ur New movies.. in a very next second I have come to the  reality that u are far more away.. missing you Sushant 😢😭
I think his year of birth was 1984.. 21st jan was Saturday...
It&#39;s literally a treat to watch and a feast to listen this man named SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT
He is beyond Brialinacey.  Mr interviewer trying to understand him
Sushant why did you Dead<br>I can&#39;t control myself from thinking about you. Crying <br>I never feel like this before for any celebrity.
10.00 the most best thing he said was rate of change is increasing and we need to learn to deal with uncertain situations and teach kids to deal with uncertain situation. same is happening today corona and all
This interview proves can&#39;t sucide
Impossible he can&#39;t be depressed.... They way he think... He knows himself very well
Thank you so much for this interview, Faridoon. I wish I had words to express how these archives are helping us cope with him not being physically present. That said, Sushant is immortal. What a beautiful beautiful boy.
Completely mesmerised by the intellect he holds...Man of wit and intelligence... gone too too soon!! Such a pure soul... may God serve Justice soonest possible.
Can&#39;t believe he is no more.... But I want him to be with us... if I could change one thing from past... I remove 14 June
Sushant look drastically different.. In Bomkesh Bakahi interview and now this interview...
RIP Sushant❤️ Praying justice for you soon.
If we doesn&#39;t make any stand for Sushant&#39;s death then we should back throne 50 years back . Because education means  and parhaps Indians  will never able do have DREAMING ....
Sushant truly loved acting, and he would keep entertaining us, but fate had different plans
A philosophical conversation
Teach emotional stability
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I am an activist. That is how I am picking up my films . That is the pattern. See the choices of my films. ~ Sushant Singh Rajput. He spoke against Suicide in his last film. Why will he commit suicide for Acting when it is the last thing on his list he likes to do? Mumbai Police, stop covering up a murder to serve Bollywood mafia.
How to deal with haters? ~ Sushant quotes What Einstein wrote to Madam Curie. He will commit suicide? NO WAY. EVER. NEVER. Acting was one of the 12 things he did. So all those theories floated by blind article writers, and Mahesh Bhatt camp that he was shattered because of his obsession with film offers and validation from hypocrites of industry is bull crap .
Whoever murdered Sushant Singh Rajput, thinks we will forget him, with time. Bollywood Mafia, you will be forgotten. Not Sushant. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushant">#JusticeForSushant</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23murdernotsuicide">#MurderNotSuicide</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbiinquiryforsushant">#CBIinquiryForSushant</a> . 🕯️🕯️ 🕯️🌹🌹🌹🙏❤️ 🕯️🕯️🕯️
Miss u yar
In K interviews dek k bahut afsus hora itne zinda dil insan itna jaldi chale gaye
He was so so so so so so so so intelligent. We can’t reach his level. Wish we had supported him earlier.
The way he speaks you need to have a different intellect. He was from different world. He got stuck with morons in the industry.
His eyes are painful in this interview. That means he was going through a lot.
About the name mansoor name,   Even sara name was not there.  Reviewer is the worst in our country
I really wanted to see him playing bajirao- how it could be
🤐
Hello Faridoon, Sushant wanted to sing the Namo Namo song. Did he sing 🎤 that and if you have the clip plsss share...
Miss u ♥️♥️♥️ bina hand gesture ke mujse bhi baat nhi hoti hai
Honestly speaking, Sushant is a rare combination. I’ve never seen any actor who speaks so much of intelligence and at the same time so finest at acting cores. Bollywood just lost a true gem like him. It’s going to be a month and I’m still clinging on his videos rewatching it again♥️
Now I&#39;m going to read up neurochemistry!!!
Did you both sing Qafirana together? Would love to listen and watch you both singing a lovely song.
We definitely need to find out the CO-RELATION and the CAUSE of your murder dear one......surely experts are gaining momentum towards pinning down the murderers.
Look at how he included every technician as being crucial to the success of a film.......only a highly evolved soul can do.
I can repeatedly watch his interviews without getting bored; it&#39;s like attending an absorbing psychology class conducted by an expressive professor 👌.
Mira ko zahar diya <br>Suhant was so divine <br>so he was killed ...<br>but he still is there as <br>Angel
He himself is Divine ...pure
Whole day one can see and listen to <br>such a lovely person
He likes Horror <br>Playing Angel now <br>Ghost for his murderers
He talks like an enlightened soul
❤️❤️❤️
It so apparent that most of Sushant&#39;s answers and statement are like overhead transmissions for him..they are so used to dumb questions and answers that he is having a tough time in deciphering his statements.That is why he is the only movie actor who enticed me ever.
♥️
He&#39;s so animated when he talks.. Look at his hands and eyes and face!  They&#39;re in total sync. It&#39;s beautiful.. <br><br>It&#39;s been almost a month now that&#39;s he&#39;s gone...  Still can&#39;t believe 😐
A wise man, philosopher, dreamer, humanist and an extra ordinary artist. <br>Great interview. Faridoon you are very good.
Indian cinema has lost a gem. Sigh.
We have made killers like Salman Khan into  a superhero...and this genius was slighted by the media....listen to him....he has every right to be arrogant about himself....rest of these so called industry insiders utter complete nonsense....their low IQs turn them into sycophantic dogs to the Johars and Chopras
Am not on social media but would really want to be part of the campaign against Sushant&#39;s slandering.....no actor matches his intelligence, his prowess in dancing, his acting potential....wish the media had given him his due....didn&#39;t discover him earlier coz he was never promoted by the media
I have never been a filmy buff....but listening to Sushant ...admire his dedication, hardwork, quest for perfection.....wish his coterie had nurtured him and wish the entire johar,Chopra and Khan clan perishes
Such a intelligent and humble person missing you sir😭😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💖
First I would like to thank the interviewer, you have done many interviews with Sushant and have always been successful at bringing out Sushant’s intellect, that we admire in addition to his screen work. Sushant you are in a league of your own, it’s a joy listening to you dissect your thoughts for the average. We lost a treasure! and your fans are in mourning, you will stay with us. Rest in Peace!
*Now they know...&quot; And the host didn&#39;t catch that
His laughter 😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔❤❤❤❤<br>I love you! Please come back!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
Let&#39;s all focus on what be says. They&#39;s a universal consciousness which has brought us all together and it will deliver justice
look at the stupid expressions of the host as he is unable to understand the highly intellectual interview of SSR
Watching his different videos/interviews tells us that his death has been so senseless - such a brilliant mind and he had so much to look forward to and contribute to the world - all gone!! Dont know how many decades will go by, before another such a brilliant mind will land in this world! This world has become hugely poorer without him.
He was so strong that in Dec his mother passed away n from Jan he had a exams n he had  n he was rank holder .so In this critical situation he convinced himself n he moved on . So how could he committed sucide ..
There is this loss of emptiness in me since I have lost him. I miss him every moment. Everything around me somehow connects to him. It&#39;s been three weeks and yet the hurt is still the same. I feel like I can never get over this heartbreaking reality. Everywhere I go, I see him. I see him in the STARS he admired the most. I see him in the RAIN that poured heavily on the day he left us. I see him in the LAUGHTER of the kids he adored the most. I see him in the KINDNESS of my mother that he yearned for the most. I see him in the NEEDY people that he wanted to help the most. I see him in the SICK that he wanted to heal the most. I see him in the PHYSICS/MATHEMATICS equations that he was curious about the most. I see him in the CODING that he wanted to learn the most. I see him in the LITERATURE that he was fond of the most. I see him in the NIGHT LIT SKY he would gazed through his telescope the most. I see him in the zeal of eyes of a DREAMER. I see him in ME, in YOU. He is in ALL OF US. He has become ETERNAL, beyond the limitations of Time and Space. Now I can find him everywhere person who makes so much sense is bound to be IMMORTAL. He is a STAR who was born to touch our hearts and be IMMORTAL within us. <br><br><br>Always in my heart, Sushant Singh Rajput.
between all the interviews sushant is more keen to talk about his interests a lot with bollywood hungama.
RAJEEV MASAND COPUY LEKE BETHTA HOGA REVIEW LIKHNE
Yeh Sushant Ji ka ghar hai blurr kia hua hai. Books n so many books. It was his favourite house jise woh stupid and fraud Rhea haunted bol ke such high rent ke ghar pe le gayi. There only everything happened and he was murdered. Sab planning lagti hai. May God give him justice.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=120">2:00</a> &quot;the industry is quite surprised&quot;.. yeah ofcourse, they did everything they could to stop its release but they failed, and the audience supported Sushant.. STARS Must Be Surprised.
Talented guy
He&#39;s not here anymore to do interviews promotions like this for his new and last movie Dilbechara 😥😥😥
Only Susant in bollywood could talk with this level of intelligence , intelectuality n humbleness...this is why we miss him must....not only just a actor in bollywood
Even if i die i can play ghosts..:(
He said looking forward to the next interview. That’s the positivity this guy had . He can never give up
He’s a cusp of an earth and air sign. That’s why he’s paradox. We love u sushant . We want justice and eternal peace for you
I have noticed that the host never understood him, his face expression clearly showed.
Intelligence and humility personified.......
Thank you for this interview faridoon . Its treasure for sushants fans

History has been written but in d worst way 2020 could offer. He would be the only actor in this world who would be loved more post his death than when he was alive. We blame media for it. For not keeping us aware of his INTELLIGENCE, COMPANIES, CODING SKILLS, TEACHING SKILLS, ACTING SKILLS, EXCELLENT VIEWPOINT, CRAFT OF LEARNING ANY NEW SKILL, hard work, BEING OK WITH LEAVING ACTING AND STARTING A NEW CAREER, PHILANTHROPY but INSTEAD boasting about some star kids weight loss/pcod/mom-loss struggle. Media always covers up wrong news. Bhed chaal. For not giving national award to him for dhoni but wasting it on Sonam caz his father had political connections. This man here SSR did not even call his struggling days as struggle. I am totally in love with him. But 😟 i am so sorry. So so disturbed by his murder. Its a full stop from me on bollywood movies. He is like d JORDAN PETERSON OF INDIA. So many talents in one soul. No wonder earth couldn&#39;t handle it ! I so hate that doctor. I curse that doctor loses d most precious family member of his so that he realises what pain it is.
He was so humble and polite. How do these journalists after knowing and talking to him so personally still went on to write demeaning stuff about him in blinds. Such pathetic people I curse them all the suffering they gave to this amazing boy. They stole him away from us. I&#39;ll never forgive them for this.
Kedarnath was one of the best movie of all times. Its tragic and it&#39;s a pity that it got embroiled in controversy. Fabulous piece of work, stellar performances by Sushant &amp; Sara..it will be always in our memories.
Cbi krwa do modi ji bilkul acha nhi lag rha 4 April ho gya h ap log kyu cbi inquiry nhi kr rhe china ka drama shuru kr diya ap logo ne is case ko dabane k liye sab samjh aa rha h plz do cbi investigation asap🙏
Looking forward to the next interview he said in the end.
<b>What happend to Chanda mama door ke?😭 It would be a sci-fi movie something very fresh in bollywood.These nepo kids movies r so boring with cliche predictable plots evertime.Sushanth would do Hollywood level movies if he was with us now🙃</b>
I could listen to him all day, everyday. God bless Sushant! Huge loss to mankind.
Faridoon ji - thank you for listening and letting a wonderful interview happen. Ab bas yeh yaadein hi reh gayi hain.
Watching his interviews again and again. Crying. Sad. Because It does not make any sense. Does not feel real even now. Why why why why why. 💔💔💔💔😢😢😢😢😢. Difference between a correlation and causation. He is so sincere. Dil bechara...kya Sushant...Kyun kiya. Yun toh har baat Sushant itna detail mein sincerely samjhata hai, but how come he takes such a big step without a hint! Bizzare!
Super Brainy Physicist Actor Bollywood has ever seen. He is Brilliant. He should have been Academician and students would have benefitted immensely. Why did you join dumbo Bollywood?
He is something else...far ahead of his contemporaries. Now he is living in another world. He would always live in our hearts .I wish I could have meet such an honest,humble and intelligent man. There is so much one can learn from him.
Sushant ❤💔<br>Mansur Khan 💕
missing himmm baddddlyyyy...oouccchhh itss hurtttsss sooo much...😓😓
Why does Faridoon does show acknowledgement when Sushant speaks?  The look in Faridoon&#39;s eyes is disapproval.
People only with deep intellectual can understand this interview
oh shushant sachi kahan tum.chlegye kiu kiu
bhagwan kiu shushant ko he kiu ab kiski movie dekhege kisko sunege bahot galt kia apne bhagwan shiv ji galt kita tuc 😭😭😭💔
I have watched this interview a number of times now and he clearly seems upset, sad in this interview..This is especially evident at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1351">22:31</a> where he looks so emotional that it’s heart breaking!! Yet his answers are still as deeply reflective insightful and thought provoking as ever!! What a gem we lost :(
Very intelligent answers.  Love SSR
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1545">25:45</a> ❤️💔😢
Bollywood Industry would have been just fine for years to come if there were only few brilliant actors likes Sushant Singh Rajput, Raj Kumar Rao, Vicky Kaushal, Kangna Ranaut, Irrfan Khan, and few other self-made  theatre actors. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dreamteam">#dreamteam</a>
&quot;As a society we don&#39;t acknowledge nuance... there is a difference between correlation and causation..&quot; Who else in Bollywood speaks like this? :(

muh dekho anchor ka expression aise de raha hai jaise alien dekh liya ho....
I can just keep listening to Sushant  the whole day...he is such a bright chap. It makes me laugh when I compare him to other kids in acting.
How did he go from that to this in 1.5 years?
This is called an interview
You are so... real 🌟 Sushant Singh Rajput.... miss you....♥️
He used to talk with his fans also such a humble person!!!
His sense of humour is so good!! Miss u sushant

Itna intelligence????itna???saalo nepo kids ko yeh interview samajhne ka knowledge tak nahi hai....why man why????tumhara brain tumhare sabse precious thing tha...
He dead so stop saying RIP and who is seeing this after his Suicide and all. Just enjoy interview
One of the more intelligent actors.
After studying this man properly I can say even in depression he cannot commit suicide. This is definitely a murder!! (He was NOT in depression just saying even if he would have been in depression he couldn&#39;t commit suicide) he was murdered. Even a dumbass can tell that. The ligature mark on his neck itself makes it evident.
He was a topper and would always been on the top this is what didn&#39;t digest by these movie mafiya gangs.it&#39;s so sad we lost such a brilliant Actor
Sushant Singh is wearing this T-shirt <br> “Schrodinger’s smiley”<br><br>Schrodinger’s emoticon is in a superpositional quantum emotional state of being both happy and sad at the same time
Please watch the whole interview of him before scrolling down. You can take a hell lot of inspiration from him.😞😔😕
I wish I was his friend , I am an introvert too
Here I can see sadness in his eyes..😪♥
Brilliant mind....
My god. What intelligence. His thought process is so deep and clear. Never have seen an actor talk like this. What a loss 💔. He is brains, good looks and talent.
U as an interviewer , is very good U r media , dnt let off like this , which happens all the time with suicidal cases
The investigation should not stop and truth should be revealed
he looks upset and sad in this interview
Sushant’s t-shirt 💔😔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1642">27:22</a> Sushant Singh Rajput Paradox 🥺
The hint of what is Sushant&#39;s feelings is on his shirt. From one side he looks happy but from the other side he is sad.
Sb upar se jaa rha hai bhai k... Man SSR  is too genius... Coding on grounds💕
Hv been watching all bt him,crying for three days now,wat a loss....He was such gifted child....God wat we hv lost ..nvr knew him so well...
Kings of nepotism Salman khan and Karan Johar  ...they need to be answered for Sushant death. and not giving the place Sushant deserves...These people only want to see star kids appear in the cinema ...They drag Sushant kill himself ....how to tolerate such a pressure when it&#39;s coming upon on his chest .. Such a innocent poor boy he must have gone lot through with these egoistic people, And I still say Sushnath you could have not done that ..where ever you stay happy RIP ...and my CURSE TO ALL OF THEM who put him in such a tragedy.
Poor Sushant he was wiping his tears of here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1382">23:02</a> 😔😔 He mentioned somewhere in this interview of being laughed at... 100% it&#39;s from the bollywood &quot;biggies&quot;
Love how Sushant talks about correlation and causation. I science we talk about it all the time. We always try to find causation, correlation is not enough.
Unke shirt me notice kiya kisi ne ek side se smile face or under se udas
Want to read his journal 150 Days.Hope I <a href="http://can.no/">can.No</a> one can ever killed this person mentally that&#39;s why he was killed physically. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23demandjustice">#DemandJustice</a>
No one have the this level of knowledge in bollywood industry ..............<br>He was the only person in bollywood who have more n more knowledge in every field .....💥💥💥💫💫💫
He even remembered his fans... what a wonderful personality he was ❤️
I need a DAMN REASON!!!!
Bhai I will always remember you in good things..rip
😭
aapko koi angrej nahi sun raha hai dost hum hindustani aapko sun rahe too indian bande ki interview to hindi main kro🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Love for u sushanth
Sushant kyu itni jaldi kr di abhi bohot time tha apke pass to proof himself 😭😭
He was so intelligent and inspirational!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=432">7:12</a> difference in correlation and causality
He was too intelligent and most genuine personality  of bollywood
I think he was more like the Nikola Tesla of bollywood. Smart, giving, geniune, but the people around him defamed him, loathed him until he thought of himself nothing at all. <br>The Schodingers smiley on his shirt says a hell lot. It was right there, but we all failed to notice.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1172">19:32</a> what&#39;s this? Vincent van Gogh behind him who committed suicide at the age of 37. Find out who Van Gogh was.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1260">21:00</a> he blinked and tears came down but he smartly wiped it off!!
I wish he is alive !!! Ur An amazing human being such a great person oh god why did u do it!! I’m so disturbed thinking about this that why did u do it ... I wish I could hv been to listen to ur problems I know it sound silly coz he doesn’t know me at all I’m a random person who is his fan but I really feel I was there for u so that u would be alive now !!! .... super intelligent and down to earth person u are and we lost you I wish we can get u back but it’s not possible no matter what we we al tell now doesn’t get u back but I pray that u be happy whet ur now and we always love u rest in peace Sushant Singh Rajput 💔
Waoo how intellectually he responded all the questions. And he explained very well many concepts inbetween. Waoo very intelligent you was Shush. If the news is right that u did suicide then you did too bad with youself and your dear one&#39;s.
More I see him more I m feeling upset I my eyes fills with tear..I don&#39;t know I m not able to come out of this
I DID NOT KNOW SUSHANT BEFORE HIS DEATH. I HAVE BEEN DISCOVERING HIM SINCE AND I AM IN LOVE. SUCH A WONDERFUL SIMPLE, INTELLIGENT DOWN TO EARTH HUMAN.THIS GUY IS AWESOME. HE IS WHAT BOLLYWOOD NEEDS TO MAKE A CHANGE. I AM SICK OF THOSE PRETENTIOUS STARS LIKE SALMAN KHAN, KARAN JOHAR ETC. BOYCOTT &#39;COFFEE WITH KARAN&#39;<br>BOYCOTT THE NEPOTISM THAT BOLLYWOOD NURTURES.
He is no more!!!😢😢😢😢😢
I feel this interview of him is very different from so his previous ones. <br>He is not right in this interview.. what I mean is he is different or very different. <br> was he drugged or in hangover or is he depressed of something back in his mind. Because he is talking very very intellectually.. but That mischief thing was missing.. smile miss horahi hai.. <br>He is one of the most intellectual actor I had ever seen.. I don&#39;t know but I just can&#39;t get over the fact as to how did he just jumped off the cliff blindly even after his mind being with so much fabulous thoughts. Haar kaise maan gye yaar.. !! Miss you dude..!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=1541">25:41</a> you should have never said that 😒😔it seems to be my personal loss.
Interviewer not in sync with him, Anupana would have nailed it
Overactive mind, maybe troubled him
Behind him van Gogh painting who was a van Gogh n he also did suicide
By seeing his interviews we are coming to know that he is the finest drop of honey which can&#39;t be tasted in a glass of a beer ..
Really heart breaking......sushanth...y brother y u did like this....😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
vast truth in everyword he speak.mainstream interview has ruined the gem interview like this.
Want people like kangana Ranaut who say truth... We know that he was depressed bcos he didn&#39;t get what he deserved .... We want justice !!!!!! Rip Sushant <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkwklMAuwK4">https://youtu.be/CkwklMAuwK4</a> u can watch if u want no one is forced....
I can&#39;t believe yar itni deep thinking. nobody can imagine ki inke dimag me kya kya chal rha tha ..This is a huge loss for the country I must say this
I’ll miss you bro. I’ll really do
R.I.P sir
so intelligent, philosophical and so profound. He has an infinite depth of understanding emotions and complexities of our behavior and patterns of cognition. He could have been a beautiful teacher.
Very rare, self-motivated, deep actor, he has always developed himself. Very inspirational person. World will always learn from you. We love you sir. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ripsushantsir">#RIPSushantsir</a>
Itna pyara aur intelligent admi. I can&#39;t believe aisay kaisay chala gya
Rip😭
RIP sir, suicide is never the answer guys. Look to God😞🙏🏾
Who came here after his suicide news🙄
He s matured enough and a motivator too.he s always used to take madam curie like legends for his examples.i dont think ths s a suicide .There is something unknown behind his death like sreedevi mam
💔
why do i feel like he cried before the interview started...maybe we only truly pay attention to a person and see beyond what you see when the person is no more..feel saddened by the news...and i don&#39;t necessarily get affected by passing of public figures...never thought this guy was not well...only if i could have done something about it
I came after his suicide. I hope he&#39;s better there now 😔🥺😭
RIP Sushant gone too soon
I sense some sort of unrest in the way he&#39;s speaking here
That was one inspiring interview.. And a person who had so many interests, still can&#39;t believe what happened with him today !!🙏🏽
His t-shirt though😟
He was one of his kind! A terrible terrible loss to the film industry 💔 <br>Such a humble man reaching out to so many on a daily basis
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Who is here after SSR&#39;s death
It was definitely not a suicide !!!!<br>I just pray that the culprit gets punished ..<br>Maybe he was too intelligent for them ..he knew how to think and feel and would have inspired the audience to do  the same , which is what most of them can&#39;t and don&#39;t want us either <br>A very big loss for the industry ..<br>Shocked , shattered, heartbroken
Rip sir😭😭😭
rest in peace sir
RIP Sushanth .....You are always the best
Just notice the symbol on his T shirt...it says alot!!
Rip sir
Gone too Soon
Miss u
Who is after his suicide 😥😥😥😥
Who else watching this after Sushant Singh Rajput sucide news 😢😢
SSR R.I.P😭😭😭
Who is here after his suicide 😭😭😭
Rip sushan singh rajpoot
Rip sweetheart😭😭😭
NO MORE SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT R.I.P
who is here after sushant singh suicide,like for his RIP
Rip
Rip 😭😭😭😭😭😭☹️☹️☹️☹️
He is the actor who has given movies <br>Like <br>Dhoni the untold story<br>Kidarnath  <br>Kai po che <br>Chhichore <br>And still he is so underrated but people are backing up actors like tiger varun over him that&#39;s sad and hurting for actors like him
Probably the most underrated actor.... the films he has done so different, every time he comes with the content films...actors like him should b backup so he can have the enough confidence to do movies like he has done...... ❤
THE ANCHOR IS PURE ISLAMIST
&quot;Co-relation aur Causation alag cheezein hoti hai&quot; well said<br><br>Sushant has mastered explaining these kind of facts
This Man Is The Most Knowledgeable Actor I&#39;ve ever seen !! 😱
Versettile, n super intelligent
one of the best interview of sushant thanks Bollywood  hungama
Now kedarnath is became my favorite movie..
Sushant live the mansoor khan..role verryyy seriously..
I really love mansoor khan.
he had the saddest eyes when his charakter was talking about his father i enjoyed his performance
Sushant is a true  Aquarian. Aquarius: The mad scientist n humanitarian of the zodiac. They are different but definitely one of the best.
nice hancy sushant love u💔💘
This journo is so biased and has hidden agenda
i love his voice when he speaks english anyone like me?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=43">0:43</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85eLjkNMh4I&amp;t=120">2:00</a> this guy is a frickin genius and really knows his craft more than anyone 😍😍
He is so intelligent.
He is just amazing in all his ways.. that&#39;s the reason he is my favourite..😍😊😘💕
Saala bhikari jaisa dikhta hai!!!!
Sushant seems to be just woken up 😊
Thnq for interviewing him. I love his talk , description on subtle things with so much knowledge. He is more than an actor. He always puts thoughts on life that make him slightly away from his competitors. Movies come and go. It doesn&#39;t matter it gets hit tag or floppy . SSR will always be into my heart....regards!!
❤
He is going very deep..so intelligent person..
According to me coding will get upgraded so that every human can understand it....
Sushant is the perfect example of being energetic, humble and enthusiastic without being a fake showoff unlike Ranveer singh.
HE IS JUST PERFECT THE WAY HE IS
Sushañth Singh - JØKER Dârknight
He says science is maths . Per kidhar hai is gyan baba ke
Thanks a lot for interviewing him..!!❤
OMG I am in tears..I don&#39;t know why...I have never see such a humble person ever..love u Sush &lt;3
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I am so amazed how intelligent he is ... the way he views everything and understands in depth I dont think any other bollywood actor or actress has such a brilliant mind ... an intelligent man is such a turn on ... he stole my heart 🤗😍
Something is special
Listen
Genius.
Excellent interview but Sushant should work on his body language. Lots of regards😀
His words are so meaningful! 💜❤️
Fantabulous movie it was!! Picking up small issues &amp; assemble them to a movie is a bang on. &amp; I just want to tell shushant that u must have heard of ban in Uttarakhand &amp; my relatives from Uttarakhand travel here in UP just to see ur movie.. Dude anything  wont work if ur moto is good &amp; content is so strong
Life sab sikha deti hai... shusant sir you are live example.
This much intelligency in answers reflects the deep thinking ,studying and understanding...
A prime example of what you can achieve if you work on your skills and improve yourself constantly. Everything else will follow!
Best human best actor rare to find such humble down to earth celebrity !
One of the best in Bollywood ! Sushant Singh Rajput!
What a superrr intelligent person and one of the best actor we have. Commendable !!
he is just too good to be an actor
All his interviews seem like he’s giving a discourse ... he seems so wound up.. lovely actor though .
I love this guy shushant <a href="http://singh.best/">Singh.Best</a> actor of recent time
He is the next biggest thing in bollywood.
thanx  sir for interviewing him ....... bcuz he is not everyones cup of tea.....
