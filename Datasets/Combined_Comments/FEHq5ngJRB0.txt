Awesome 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤘🏻💯
In many ways this movie is rather sexist. Male friendships ruined by women, typical BS trope
Akshay khanna is too freakin good man <br>His subtle expressions ❣️
2 K2AA MCDs imposed upon us as heroes...go figure!!
Kya ek waqt tha ...<br>Actually, main akash hoon ...<br>Shala, ab kaha ake fass gaye ... 😀
I would give equal credit to its awesome BGM. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=243">4:03</a>
Growing up in the 80s anyone remember s the timeless classic... Chashme Bhadoor.... Farooq Sheikh and Deepti naval...directed by Sai Paranjape...u can relate to it more...Sai one indias best director...a woman how well she captured the three bachelor s lives ....its still so refreshing watching it ....
😂😂
Can&#39;t remember how many times my wife said she doesn&#39;t like my friend(s)...bastards they&#39;re always there in times of need 😊
Har circle me ek Akash jaisa kameena dost hota hai aur ek sid jaisa samjhdar dost
Before this film, I despised Bollywood films
Priya is very toxic
Aamir khan❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=249">4:09</a> priya kya thodi retarted hai sameer ne jab usse call kara toh akash ke landline sei he toh kara hai toh iska matlab woh uske ghar par he toh hai😂 gadhi aurat😂
a timeless work of art
India’s top gun
Golimaar do
Just amazing refreshing movie
Sir ji F make film
2024 coming but this movie still young
How idiot  this girl is  this  is landline  call if sammer was not aakash home hw he taking on phone with priya from aakash home  use brain not boyfriend
Asli mai to dosti tutjae
This movie is still the best  n still the favorite its all about friends n only friend ship
This movie is far ahead with time
22 years and still popular
In this movie scene everyone relates with their own friends and the most beautiful moments of life lived ❤️
Age difference lovestory khanna, Saif dangerous torture , amir to unique love story ...🤓
Man A Timeless Gem 😂😂❤❤
Jab priya ki baat already ho gayi Sameer se Akash ke ghar mai hi aur fir jab priya ne phone kiya tab Akash ne kaha ki Sameer yaha aaya hi nai ....tabhi priya ko samjh jana chaiye tha ki Akash jhuth bol raha hai.......plz correct me if I am wrong
This film deserves Oscar
What was funny in this?
In the first scene she wants him to stop seeing Akash. <br>In the last scene she slaps him for not being at Akash&#39;s. 😅
This is the perfect example of those who irritate u the most are the ones who cares for u the most❤
so i watched this movie for the third time. 1st was when i was in school. I liked the film then. Than i watched the movie 2nd time when i was completing college. I liked the movie more this time. Now i am 30 and watched this movie for 3rd time. Believe me every watch was a different experience all together. This movie is a masterpiece. What the hell happened to farhan akhtar man. why doesn&#39;t he makes movies like these anymore?
AK is the best
Amir looks like turbo movie villain
Amazing superb movie 💯👍🔥 Saif Ali Khan acting very very good and award winning performance Saif Ali Khan 💯👍🔥 so excited part2...
Now people don’t have any problem with this movie? All 3 of them are nepo kids 🙄
Just amazing Akshey Khanna expression 😂😂😂 when amir was on the call 📞
Jab akash ke phone se call Kia Sameer ne . Toh akash ke ghar kaise nahi aaya honga😂😂😂😂. Wo landline phone hai akash ke ghar per hi rahenga😂😂😂
Nobody could&#39;ve played Siddharth better than Akshaye Khanna 👌👌👌💖💖💖. He was brilliant and phenomenal as Siddharth 👏👏👏🥰🥰🥰. The way he portrayed the introverted and mature personality 🔥🔥🔥😘😘😘. <br><br>Akshaye Khanna suited the role/character Siddharth 👌👌👌🔥🔥🔥. This role was tailor- made for him only 👏👏👏🥰🥰🥰. He nailed this character brilliantly to the core 👌👌👌❤️❤️❤️. I loved Akshaye Khanna the best in this film 🥰🥰🥰🥰. Siddharth was the best character out of all the 3 🙏🙏🙏😘😘😘.
Saif ,aamir ,khana they are legend
The fone from which sameer called to her girlfriend was same as on which sameer&#39;s girl friend called her later. Why did she agree on akash&#39;s lie that sameer was not here. The number was same both the time.
This is advance movie on that time.  Some people are not understand that time.
People often describe this movie as &quot;ahead of its time,&quot; but in truth, it&#39;s timeless. It encompasses all the essential elements of youth, including friendship, carefree living, relationships, and emotions. It resonates with audiences from any era, as it captures the essence of the young generation in its entirety.
there&#39;s a plot hole in the phone conversation scene.
I really don&#39;t understand how come some people are so mad about girls that they don&#39;t even think of their self-respect.
EPIC Scene. What a movie. Watched it in Coimbatore Apsara Theatre back in 2001 or 2002... not sure. I believe the theatre itself is no more.
All time fav movie
I had same frd as sameer😂😂
MY FAVORITE👍😍 SEEN😊😅
Amir sahi bolra he saif done be a ladki ka gulam 😂🙆🤣
It is as fresh as water till date...fantastic and way ahead of those days ...excellent movie ..waiting for another 😊
But call was dialed n recieved from the same phone right . Akash telling sameer was not here doesn&#39;t make any sense
This never gets old!! Still laugh the same way I laughed the first time I watched this masterpiece. To me, this movie is pure Happiness!!
I miss only one thing...during 90s I missed it to watch in theatres...and watched later in VCR...<br>Whata a movie, the style, the songs, the background music, and acting....<br>What a perfect movie...<br>Perfection ko Improve karna mushkil hai❤
😂😂😂😂
My फेव्हरेट मूवी ❤
This movie never get old
Sameer (Saif) talked to his gf from akash home phone right now...and after few min she called again on the same home phone and Akash (Aamir) says that he didn&#39;t came there....and at the same time she believed as well.....😂😂😂
Best movie on Friendship
Farhan making always great movie real life inspiration it was a true friendship showing in this movie i most like dil chahta hai ❤
But she called on the same phone in which Saif called her . Didn&#39;t she realise his with  Aamir
That Akash&#39;s painting drawn by sid was awesome👍
Original coming of age....❤❤❤
Cringe movies
Red color ka trouser pahna he saif ne... Lol
This timeless movie was made timely
Tu kabhi nahi sudheraga ye bt mere daston ne bht bar bole mujay
This movie was a true game changer from all the actors involved especially Aamir&#39;s perfectionism. <br><br>He showed everyone at that time, how acting should be done with his sublime performances. <br><br>He set the bar so high that it hasn&#39;t been challenged still to this day. Only one or two can stand toe 2 toe with him in a acting sense. The guy just thinks differently outside the box compared to your usual boring types.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=157">2:37</a> 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
Which film were Aamir Khan and Akshaye Khanna watching on the television before Saif Ali Khan entered the frame
🤣
Saif ali khan 🤣🤣😃
A TRUE friend is a precious asset
Evergreen movie and evergreen scene...jitne tarif karu utni kum hai..
&quot;How can she slap&quot; 😂😂
Kitna Kameena Charatcter hai Aamir Khan, aur usne pura kameeniapan se kiya bhi hai. :) Love watching him again and again.
now i got it... but the girl called to akash landline right and saif picked it initially....
Peetega Sala 🤣🤣
Saif always my favourite 😜🤣🤣🤣
Call back at same number
There is a catch in this scene, if she had talked with Saif on the same ph sometime back, how can Aamir say Saif hasn&#39;t been here  n she believes him ??
I just love Akshay.. Among very few guys i like.
Imagine a crossover between Dil Chahata Hai and ZNMD as the sequel 🤩
Akshay best&#39;hero&#39;
No BS dialogue, no exaggerated emotions. Even Farhan could never reproduce such effect in any of his movies. ZNMD etc are good but DCH was class apart.
Who can give me the link of full movie
The Title for this Video should be &quot;Akash saves Sameer&quot;  🤣😂<br>But its really tough to be in a Toxic Relationship <br>I have experienced it 😥
October 10 2022....<br>11.39 PM
People saying why Farhan stopped making movies because he lost his raw tallent just like karan johar, it was start of his carrier and his passion and hunger to bring all out just decreased by time.<br>DCH and Lakysha were made by heart compared to Don 1 and 2 which were just made to make money.<br>This is the reason Anurag Kashyap still comes up with some fresh even after going main stream because he tend to make with low budget with still with passion.<br>Farhan will never make a small budget movie with non-superstars, these people got heavy bills to pay.
this movies is awesome yaar. spick cut. this movies is undastand those peaple they have very good friends . like us<br> amit. Sameer<br>ali .akash<br>bhushan.sidd
The film was way ahead  of it&#39;s time.
Farhan Akhtar should get royalty from Goa Tourism ministry for this movie !
Can&#39;t love this movie more!!!<br>Lots and lots of love Farhan Akhtar!!!😍💖💗❤
Im 24 . And watching this fr d first time . Only came here for aamir. But haven&#39;t seen refreshing movies like this now. As usual aamir is excellent❤
Aamir khan 😂😂
This movie changed the landscape of Indian cinema changed everything
अंदाज़ अपना अपना<br>दिल चाहता है<br>रहना है तेरे दिल में <br>लक्ष्य (ऋतिक)<br>स्वादेस(शाहरूख)<br>काइट्स (ऋतिक )<br>रॉकस्टार<br><br>are the movies which are far away ahead of its times. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
An ageless movie...
Farhan Akhtar is a way ahead of his time . Directed iconic movies like Dil chata hai and lakshya.
i used to hate aamir&#39;s phone move but he actually did a big favour to saif
My favorite indian movie, i was 11 or 12 when  i watched this movie now im 32, still had a lot of memories.
Smile of Akshay Khanna&gt;&gt;

Lekin wo ...  suno to... magar me ...tm ne to .... akàsh k haan 😅😅😅😅
U
Typical bossy and insensitive girlfriend. .
21 yrs old movie. Such a cult classic, can watch it over n over again. A true masterpiece by Farhan Akhtar
6 minute ka clip, ek ne bhi gaali nahi di.
This movie was Saif&#39;s career&#39;s turning point!!
Jab usi number pe call aya tha to pagli kaise maan gyi ki sameer waha ni tha....
This movie was way ahed of its time <br>I remember as a kid my parents disliking the movie because it had no &quot;family&quot; in the mains like mummy papa beta bahu bua ji devrani jethani or vilans ... hahaha only friends
A more romantic and serious version of Zindagi Na Milegi Dubara
Dil Chahta hai<br>Zindagi na Milegi dobara<br>Dear Zindagi<br>Dil Dhadakney Do<br>Best movies with no bollywood shit, realistic and so relatable!

This movie is way ahead of its time
I love Saif so cute
..learned something... no caller ID it seems here can be such a disadvantage...!!!😄
Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna were totally different in the Race movie
Pittega saala 😂😂
Har ek friend kamina hota hai 😀😂
DCH change Hindi cinema dynamics for better. That melodrama cinema of 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s were bit done.
Pitega saala😂😂
You must have group of 3 friends in your life...
💜
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=307">5:07</a> was amazing
This movie is aging like a wine. Jitni baar daikho relevant hoti ha
Kon kon November 2021 me ye video dekh raha he. 😍 Batao jaldi. 👍😍
I’d have had Saif looking around to see if anyone’s watching this farce being played out. What alpha girls usually do.
I can relate myself to aamir character 😂😂
One of the best movie
One of the best Indian movie. Right up there with Sholay and MughleAzam
The look with which Sid and Akash look at Sameer
Amir.- mard ban. Be a man. <br>Saif - yes. I m a man. Ab me jata hu.. <br>Aamir-  ab Pitega sala. 🤣🤣🤣
Bhai dost hai agr tumhare toh iss movie ko zaroor dekhna aur agr nhi hai dost tb bhi dekhna zaroor n bnana dost.
Sach do ladko ki dosti ke beech tisri ladki entry maarti to sach main decision lena muskil hota hai jaise ki humare case main hua tha
This movie is still is way ahead of it&#39;s time 🙌
My favourite movie ever, Amir Mr perfect.
All of them watching TV straight but when Aamir switches of tv it&#39;s on their left side...what a direction
Rdb and dil chahta hai are hands down the best movies of amir khan
In real life , by character wise ,Whom do you people resemble ? I&#39;m almost similar to character of Akash 😄😄
Heathe ledger drawing on the wall....JOKER😍 hats off to farhan
Amir Khan☄️🌊❄️💝
Saif gave many superhits during 2000s to present
This movie is way ahead of its time...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=186">3:06</a>
I would crave for a friend like Akshaye.
Aisi hutiya gf kisi ko na mile 😂😂
Breakup karna hai toh karo lekin thappd kyun mara 🙄 he doesn&#39;t deserve that
Ek chiz koi smjhao sameer ne to usi phone se baat kiya tha jisse akash ne baat kiya udki gf se to usey to pata chal jana chahiye tha ki Akash jhut bolra h
Ya ?<br>Ya 🤔<br>Ya !!!
Akshay Khanna Over Actor
Wow firki is in this movie
Dil chahta hain vs zindagi na milegi dobara. I think both are a masterpiece
Saif&#39;s character is something very funny and affable ..he is most inocent and easy going in the gang
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=170">2:50</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=365">6:05</a> aisi ladkiyon se dosti karne ki zaroorat nhi hai jo sirf Keemat maange dosti ki
Aisi priya ho to mai bhi mana kardu
Akshay Khanna Is best
This movie was ahead of its time.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=265">4:25</a> Who is that kamina friend like Aamir Khan😂
What Gajini&#39;s portrait doing on the wall?
Aj puja kal koi duja 😂😂
Ha mai, Lekin mai....... 😜😝😁🤣
Aamir Khan the boss
Saif is my favourite actor ❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Sid solved the Rubik&#39;s cube
Dil Chahta Hai &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
saif-  helooo nhi to .. mai to .. pr suno to... <br>hahaha 😂
But he use same phone
Kujh  character Yade ban jati h jo kobhi nahi pholai jati
Aamir khan was fantastic in this movie.
Akshay&#39;s shoulder held high walk is next level class. 🔥🔥
Ye sala dobara saf ka devosh karayega
It&#39;s a benchmark movie for any college triplet  group segment
Always waiting for the scene main Aakash ke yaha 😂😂😂😂
We actually lived this movie
Aamir ignited the flame within saif mard ban be a man and eventually Pitega salla was outstanding
Most underated actor : akshay khanna
Saif ali khan was handsome dude that time
Best directions producer technision no words
Akshaye Khanna is such an underrated actor. Love his acting and his character in the film. ❤️👌
Jab wah Akash ke ghar phone karke Sameer se baat karti tab woh kaise maan gayi Sameer waha nahi tha
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKfOhPTW3s">https://youtu.be/wbKfOhPTW3s</a>
Shalini ke mangetar ne to Akash ke right eye  par Mara tha to left eye par Nishan agya...how??
This era of Saif was so good<br>Dil Chahta hai<br>Hum Tum<br>Salaam Namaste<br>Kal ho na ho<br>Parineeta<br>Ta ra rum pum<br>Thoda pyar thoda magic
Akash ne bacha liya Sameer ko iss bossy GF se. :D :D :D
this movie relatble till now
Pitega  saala
Girls in this movie except. Preeti are having dark complexion. But the have been cast. And looks amazing too 😍
But she called on the same phone from which Saif calls her how she couldn&#39;t see that numbers are same 😐
I love Dil Chahta hai 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Best movie...absolutely great..
He Should Say Mard Ban Kadak Ban  Tu Dhokla🤭
This movie changes an era of Indian movie history
Amir khan is best
3 Idiots<br>Dil chahta hai<br>Zindagi na milegi Na dobara<br>🔥🔥🔥
But akash did that to save his friend sameer&#39;s life from that nondeserving girl
Yeh scene ka amir khan exactly mai hu😂😂😂.Har waqt mazaak and bajaate rehta hai dosto ki 😂😂
Luv the movie my first movie with my hubby
Dumb girl how she dont Forgot same landline number she talk with sameer and that was not mobile when she talk akash
Said Ali Khan so boyish face..  Clean his shave today and kareena will get taomoor&#39;s elder brother..😁
How bulky pyjamas and pants they used to wear.. And now so tight that they hardly bent their legs...
20 year&#39;s gone my friends still planning for Goa
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=234">3:54</a> my fav scene 🥰
Is that Aksa beach?
One of my all time fav movie
This movie was 20 year ahead of its time cause its totally relatable with our current lives.😀
Sameer....... Soch ra hu😂😂😂😂😂
20 saal hoggaya bc pata hi nahi chala kab main ek launde se ek bachche ka baap bann gaya lekin yeh gaana mujhe phirse usii daur me  le jaata hai, phirse wohi dosto main dosti ke saath jeena chahta hai ❤️ Haa yeh dil chahta hai phir na kabhi ho yaaaro ke Bin aise din 🙏
Farhaan Akhtar is a brilliant director, slightly above average actor, and a terrible singer. Yet, he wouldn&#39;t direct.
Watched dch during college 1st yr 2001...was so relatable as seeing ourselves on the screen
Why not suc films/series now.<br>Just violence these days
Saif was just too good in this movie
Movie scene tumhara naam Sameer hai haha
Ye movie me mujhe , seriously, <br>Logic dikha hi nahi, <br><br>Kisiko, bhi kabhi bhi kisise bhi pyar ho jata hai, <br>Pyar ki maa bhen krdi, iss movie ne
My character also Akash&#39;s character 😂😂😂
I love akshay khanna he is awesome in every role
Pitega Sala🤣🤣
Samar pratap singh at vivekananda university 🤣
3.44- Look at  saif-akshay here....Then compare them in Race movie...here saif is immature n akshay is like elder than him..but in Race their demenear fully interchange 👍👍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=125">2:05</a> true friend always do this 😎 no hard feelings
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=54">0:54</a> How double standard she is...use bol rahi apne dost se dur hoke uske sath ko..sath hi sath bol rahi hai mai kuch dosto k sath bahar jaa rahi hu... 🤣🤣🤣
can someone tell me Sameer called his gf with akash&#39;s landline number still his gf believed that he was not at akash&#39;s place.
Saif looks like Ibrahim Ali Khan here 😬😁😁
One thing to notice is the big blunder they have made in this scene. There were no mobile phones during that time so Said must have used the same phone that Aamir used which is clearly a sign that Saif was at Aamir&#39;s place, then how come Aamir said kl shaam se yaha nahi aaya?? And how come priya is so dumb enough to simply believe what Aamir said? Didn&#39;t she talk in the same phone to Saif a few moments ago.??
Dil chahta hai 2 bana do yaar..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=236">3:56</a> what a rhyming 😂👌
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=125">2:05</a> kam se kam protection toh mil hi jayegi 😂😂😂😂
I didn&#39;t really get the point of the prank
Akshay khanna...xpressions..blinking eyes...👌🏼👍
My Favourites:<br><br>1) Dil Chahta Hai<br>2) Kal Ho Naa Ho<br>3) Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara
Still holds true!<br>All of it still holds true!!<br>This movie is too good!!<br><br>Specially the first flashback - &quot;I hate Economics!!&quot;
i think subodh was still better than priya.... lol
ZNMD is a remake of DCH...
Pitega saala 😂😂😂
This film was second film to restart sync sound after Lagaan
Where is this actress now?
Why do movies from 1999 and 2001 look so different? Lmao
Sara dost asa hi ch***ia hay.... May God help us with girls.
This film was the best tourism ad for Goa.<br>Fun film
When there were no cellphones 😂
The throw was so good
Iconic scene man
😂
Well.. that was the same phone Akash used to receive  Priya&#39;s call which was used moments ago by Sameer to dial up Priya , how could she even beleive that Akash was telling the truth here... Looks like a miss by the movie - makers and yeah it looked like a cordless too😉
Farhan thoughts were ahead of time... Amoung the three the most innocent was saifs character...
Landline tha na 🤨🧐😣
Farhan Akhtar and Zoya Akhtar are gems!!! Such raw talent!!!
Haha very funny
This movie is cult movie ... No doubt about that
The movie that brought Saif back in industry 👍
Aamir’s character was very mean. No respect to others and their feelings. I was so happy when Akshay slaps him. Well deserved.
Every gang of 3 friends have 1 gandu, 1 baba and 1 harami.....<br><br>Be it Dil chahta hain, ZNMD or pyaar ka punchnama....
Pittega saala .... That became our catch phrase
This movie destroyed goa.    After this movie everyone wanted to go to goa .. <br><br>Goa today is a crowded market place
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=290">4:50</a> Best scene ever
Awesome maza aa gaya scene dekh kar
Fun fact: this movie and its another cousin ZNMD are directed by Farhan Akhter and Zoya Akhter. Talented siblings!! They are much ahead of time.
She calls the same number but when Akash picks it up she believes him that both of them were not together .WOW
&quot; Usne teri khuddari ko lalkara hai yar kya karha hai mard ban be a man &quot; epic lines 😂
Chandeller is Aamir Joe is Salman Ross may be Shahrukh
Slapping is the best answer 😂😂
Saif likes strong dominant women, shows in his real life lol
This movie was ahead of its time.
I love Amir Khan
I love Sameer charrecter Saif Ali khan
aakash-be a man<br>I-are you a woman
ZNMD is only movie which comes close to this masterpiece 🙏❤️
I love this movie my favorite movie
Ladies that&#39;s how guys play the role of close friends. Watch and observe 😂❤️
Whenever I watch this movie .I feel it isnot a movie ,it&#39;s like experience which happens with myself..
Low budget Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara.....<br><br><br>🤣🤣🤣
They are like indian version of James, Srius and Remus. Minus all the death and grief..
When saif called from Aamir&#39;s number , and aamir told Saif&#39;s gf that he hasn&#39;t come to his house since yesterday then why did she believe ? How was saif able to talk from Aamir&#39;s landline when he wasn&#39;t there ( According to Aamir )
Pasand aaya tujhe bhi chahiye😂😂😂
Wesy seen achaa tha lekin yeh boht bari mistake hai q k voh b Akash k e ghr k fone sy fon karta hai or Priya b us k ghr k number py fone Karti hai..but voh kehta k voh yahan aya e nai....kia bukwas bat thi wesy.🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
She redialed on Akash’s landline number shows Sameer was there few minutes ago.
Goa tourism
Saif just stole the show....
Priya is so dumb that she called on her land line both the time  she still believed Akash.
Dost ho tou aise hona chahi ye
Didn&#39;t she called on the very same phone she spoke to him before 🤔
Movie way ahead of it&#39;s time.... This movie changed the lifestyle of the people&#39;s, changed the hairstyles, changed the way of dressing, changed the way of thinking, changed the taste of movies....
2020 still I&#39;m watching it
Bhai Do Baar Bhi Call Gharke Phone Pe Aaya Aur Sameer Ne Gharme Hi Pick Kiya Phir Bhi Itna Nahi Maloom Seriously 😓 Waah Waah Modi Ji Waah
This movie was little ahead of its time..
जैसी हरकत तुमने मिर्जापुर मेँ करी उसके बाद तो हरिद्वार जाना बनता था
this movie is perfect example of time travelling
Movie bohat achi thi per akshay khana aur dimple ne bohat pakaya tha😏
Like this movie so much
This movie is for current youth no matter when you see it. I saw it with my elder brother back in 2001 and didn&#39;t fully understood it, but now when I see it, it seems it explains the issues and emotions of today&#39;s youth.
Peetega saala! 🤣🤣🤣
I never understand why farhan akhtar stopped making films... even after making gem like this.. he is better in making films than acting
Usne Teri khuddari ko lalkara hai yar
Farhan akhtar&#39;s first movie DCH<br>karAn johar&#39;s first movie KKHH<br>They repeated such a successsss
That was casio calculator watch. How could that thing slow down!
you deserve more subscribers than t series
Aamir Khan and Akshay Khanna have a 10 year age <a href="http://difference.it/">difference.It</a> works because Sid is mature and Akash is immature.
I really don&#39;t get this scene. I mean she calls back on the same number and Amir says Saif isn&#39;t with him...and she believes it
I still can remember a scene at the theatre toilet after the show was over.  There was one boy leaning against the wall clutching his hair, head down and the other boy sympathizing - &quot;maine bola tha bakwas picture hoga, tune fir bhi zid ki&quot;  !! 😃😃.  They actually came in expectation that three heroes will equate to thrice action but there was hardly any.....😂😂 !!!.  This audience is still there of course.
Who is the actress?
They seem like perfectly fine talented kids from film families :) . Aamir, Saif, Akshay and the Director Farhan!! This nepotism must be terrible.
Ha m, mgr tum, suno to,lakin wo, 😅
😂
Turning point of Akshaye and Saif
I remember the first trailer of the film had this dialogue Usne teri khudari ko larkara hai
Film used sync sound after Lagaan
Aaj pooja kal koi dooja
Sunday is a holiday.
Yeh Sam karta kya hai!

This movie really started the trend of friends gng to Goa 😀😀
Before we saw in sonu ke titu ki sweety how kartik saved his friend from ishita and sweety, aamir did it in dil chahta hai
Friends be like that what ever say whatever thing will do with him he feel angry but when say chal sale bas kar yar and immediately back in
Why this movie looks like it is made recently...
This movie was much ahead of its times.
How can he not be in akash house when he just called her and she called back on same no.
Bollywood&#39;s golden tokens ..!!
Girlfriends khud toh kitne bhi male female launde laundiyon ke sath kitni hi der tk ghumti firti rhengi, lekin agr unke boyfriends apne Male Best friends ke sath bhi rhe toh unpe restrictions lga dengi ki ya toh unko chuno ya mujhko !! This happens in real life too... <br>Khud pe koi restrictions manjoor nhi h toh hmpe kyu lgati ho be ??? Bhag behen ki laudi, khud 75 laundo ke sath ghumti rhogi aur hm apne bhai logo ke sath bhi na ghume??? <br>Ghatiya soch,
Saif Ali Khan nails the scene. He is too perfect
apple watch at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=99">1:39</a> 🤭😜
I cant beleive its 20 years<br><br>Farhan akhtar is able to make Timely but timeless movies!
Who the hell is this akash these people are talking about?? I m not gonna leave her for this akash--it
That time Truecaller was not there, that confusion won’t happen!!😅😅😅
Thank you Farhan for this masterpiece. U r multi-talented. I love ur acting too. But u as a director ...... Too good....... Please direct more..... All ur directions are either cult films or box office hit or both
Best movie in my young age, still most favourite, wish to go goa, only after watching this movie
When there was no bloody youtube and smartphones
Where are those directors.... Producers..... Writers..... of Hindi Cinema..... (MISSING)..... who gave us films like DCH, DDLJ, Lamhe, Khuda Gavah, Dil Tho Paagal Hai, KKHH, Sholay, Hamaare Dil Aapke Pass Hai, KKKG, Dhadkan, HAHK etc..... etc.... There was fun... tears.... at last &quot;happy ending&quot;..... 😱😱😱😱😩😩
What happend after thisss
Is that a heath ledger poster at the background?
Have a huge crush on Akshay&#39;s character
Haan mein... magar voh &#39;suno to... tumne to&#39; lekin main... kabse keh&#39;
Best line... Pitega Sala 😁
It&#39;s Farhan Akhtar&#39;s creation afterall
From Akash&#39;s phone Sameer called  his girlfriend <br>Within couple of minutes <br><br>And on same phone  Akash got the call call from Sameer&#39;s gf .n he said Sameer was not with him since last evening.... <br><br><br>How can Akash say this to her... <br><br>Isn&#39;t it bit incorrect 😬
That WHAAAAAAT? 😂
A girl problem.. If a boy has his ex then he should&#39;ve left her, on the other side.. She&#39;ll never leave her best friend dog, because she thinks she is right, even if the heart is on the left side 😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=202">3:22</a> That smile and dialogue of Akshay khanna😍
Akash is the best
Aamir killed it .. dint he .. was amazing to watch it in the theatre..
😛😛😛
Bharun ko lake some time por ana uaki acseptation alak place mey mather alak hey rehani ki place vi alak hey.....
We laughed when a woman slapped a man...woww!!
Saif ali khan was life of this movie.he made this movie memorable.
Chutia matlab.. Full chutia aamir khan
One of the best scenes....but here most the people who have commented on Priya not being able to get the fact that Sameer was Aakash&#39;s place as he called her from the landline didn&#39;t know the period in which the Film was made... that time everyone used to have landlines with mostly no caller ID and mobiles were very expensive ..
Akshaye ......... underrated actor....
I can see tiger Shroff on the wall
ZNMD was actually it&#39;s part 2
Farhan akthar
Dil chahte hai part - 2 with same cast.....
&quot; Vishesh tipni&quot;
DCH is actually much better than ZNMD!!
Ross is definitely Sid, intellectual, pretty intense and very committed, Chandler must have been Akash who was a prankster, had serious commitment issues and later became so sincere towards his Monika aka Shalini and Sameer? well an amalgamation of Joyee (who is naive and confused but loves his friends to death) Chandler ( silly jokes and one liner but became dead serious once he finds his ‘true love’ ); or may be they all were the extensions of the brilliance called Farhan Akhtar; in every aspect of cinema DCH was way ahead of it’s time so much so that even we the audience have felt that in 2001.
So big house and still the girl didn&#39;t had Called-ID.
mard bun be man 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kaun se desh mein yeh par 4 bajnewale hai 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ye uski gf priya anjali rai hai kya.
Cristine ne kat diya 🤣<br>Fir main kya Roz is takiye pe baitha hu
This movie is so ahead of its time that even if you watch it now if feels like it was made this year itself. From the way each and every scene was framed and shot. The cast was impeccable. The music was amazing the background score was flawless. This movie has aged like fine wine. One of the Best movies of 2001. Better than Lagaan in some aspects.
Ladkiyo ke velle kitne chutaap h.
Khuddari ko lalkara hai be a man dialogue is also in wake up Sid .. and this film is Ayan mukherjee s favorite film.he said in an interview this film inspired him to be a director.
Movie way ahead of it&#39;s time.... This movie changed the lifestyle of the people&#39;s, changed the hairstyles, changed the way of dressing, changed the way of thinking, changed the taste of movies....
ye movie ke baad kon kon goa trip pe gaya
I have many group  of 3 people.  Dosts is like that only. One darpoke, flirt and one smart guy (Matured one)
Can&#39;t believe this film didn&#39;t do well at the box office Real gem
How we&#39;d fool people during times of landline!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=348">5:48</a><br>Kabir Singh be like : Maine kiya to itna controversy!!!! 😭😭
I always thought and still thinking @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=306">5:06</a> agar such mein cube aankh ko lagjati toh... So scary... One of the greatest movies of all time in Bollywood.. just bcoz of Goa element
Bas Ek Baat samajh nahi aai, pehle sameer phir aakash dono se ek hi no pe 5 min ke andar hi baat hui and she is convinced ki sameer wahan nahi aaya tha... Bollywood logic is amazing
One great thing which Farhan Akhtar gave to bollywood. Dil Chahta Hai really changed the game of Bollywood those days.
😂😂😂😂hahahaha
This Scene is just LIT (Iconic) and a Masterpiece 🥰🥰🥰🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not sure if this is noticed, Samir&#39;s gf dialled on Akash&#39;s phone through which Samir called her earlier. She could easily make out that Akash is playing a prank on her by telling that Samir didn&#39;t come over his house.
One of the best 💖👌
Really this was very dumb........abhi to aapne usse usi phone pe baat ki hai sameer se usi phone pr ab akaash ne bola to maan liyaa ........oddd
How can she doubt on Saif bcoz he called the same phone
This film is craaaaaazyyyyyyyyyyy one of the best films bollywood ever made...!!!!
I am so lucky to have not 1 not 2 but  3 best buddies 🤸🏃🏊🏋️🤼😂🧗
Zindagi na mile ge dubara is much to learn from Dil chahta hain..very unique n genuine....
This movie is like the Friends series watch any scene of the movie anything it never gets old
This is the cult movie.. ..
Only a caring friend can save one from such chudail gf.

🤟👌👍💞💘💕🤩
He called her from a landline, and she called back to that landline. So how could she not realize that Akash was lying?
There&#39;s a glitch here. When Sameer first called her, he used the phone of Akash and told Priya that he was at Akash&#39;s place. Then Priya redialed the number and found Akash. So, I don&#39;t know why is she thinking that Sameer lied because Akash picked up the phone himself.
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=267">04:27</a></b><b> Mard ban, Be a Man!</b> 😂
Baap re baap. Aisi girlfriend to dushman ko be naseeb na ho. Itna kaun dominate karta hai
Love you Aamir ❤️
Some bitches talk like they are the last women on earth..sameer got someone really good at last.😂
Saif top level acting ..
Hahaha har group mai ek sameer jaisa chutiya zaroor hota hai
Imagine India without Muslims
Han mai, Nhi mai, Suno to, tumne to, kab se k, laikin main, Main Akash k yahan. Famous dialogue... 😂Love u saif
Bc chot kr di saif me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
fuck this movie
Just look at the interior of room...the background...this movie was ahead of his tym...
Legendary movie!!!
This movie is like Friends. It will never get old. 1000 yrs later, it will still be as fresh❤️
lol
Bakwas
Way ahead of its time . One of the best films . 👌
Ek baar big screen pr aur release kro.  If agree me so comments
Did anyone notice....saif called her from landline....but when she calls him back aamir replied that saif isn&#39;t at home.
before pyaar ka punch naama this was the greatest and will be friendship movie i ever seen.
This movie <br>To my friends <br>Ahmed shareef<br> Abdul samad

Need a part 3 of it
I love Saif acting ... Truely awesome I am a big Fan of Saif
Excelmovies Don&#39;t you think we deserve Dil Chahta hai 2 with the same trio ??
millu ke bich kaha phas gaye khanna
Dil chahta hai 2 ... should come
DCH &amp; ZNMD are the films this mankind badly needed.❤️❤️❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=224">3:44</a> - The scene which you all want to see!
This movie changed everthing. From lifestyle to hairstyle to living style to thinking style to even Saifs Career. Wowww. Its really an iconic movie. Dam.. Never ever boers you even today after almost more than 20yrs of the movie.
&quot;all iz well&quot;
Advantage of Not Having Caller ID 😂😂
I&#39;m just like amir&#39;s character in real life except of the fact that unlike his character <br>I will never fall in love with anyone
Plz comment karne se se pehle farhan akhtar ko thanks bolna hashtag lagake
Sameer called her through landline..it&#39;s obvious he was with Akash....but still funny
Very nice movie
No mobile phones, no text messaging, no social media... Them good old days
The real star of this scene was the WATCH.Always messed things upfront😇😇😇
mistak same landline num.but he said wo yehan aya hi nai
This movie changed Saif&#39;s career.
Perhaps the most iconic scene of that decade.
Trend setter movie
Aaakaashhhhh 😜
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=308">5:08</a> the way he clicks the remote button is very comedic
This very ahed time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=199">3:19</a> Akshay Khanna expresssion of maturity.
Great movie but in one scene kuch gadbad  thi jab saif priya ko phone kiya he is using cordless phone...... number bhi gaya hoga tabhi priya ne call- back kiya.. but Amir says wo to yaha aaya hi nahi ...she believe on akash statement.... funny na....but over all use time ki aur aaj bhi most modern and great movie thi aur hai... apna teenager ka time yaad aa gaya.
These type of girls are thiefs they steal love only for lust. She can&#39;t break two bestfriends
Just imagine if the same thing would have happened with a girl. Just interchange sameer and priya. All womanazis would have come ahead and shown hue and cry.
Milestone movie.... which is created a history n change the trend of Hindi movies
Don&#39;t know why all looks skinny
Bahot bada wala kat gaya iska
Lovely lovely.... the best ever child hood memories...
My favorite movie
A friend in a need (of prank) is a friend indeed....
Ladkiyo m dimaag ki kami hoti hi h..... jab saif n aamir k phone se call kiya h to wo us pr dought kaise kr skti h..
Lovely movie
Aise dost ho to dushmano ki jarurat hi nhi h
Hi Priya..(uuh) haan main, <br>Magar woh- suno to,<br>Tumne to- lekin main!<br>Kabse kya!..Main Akash ke yaha..
Poor Saif 😆
SUPERB MOVIE
In Whole Scene Akshay Khanna’s acting is supercool
The movie that finally changed Saif Ali khan&#39;s career
Aise movie aur nahee bnne waala
<b>दिल चाहता है</b><br><b>हम ना रहें कभी यारों के बिन</b><br><b>दिन-दिन भर हों प्यारी बातें</b><br><b>झूमें शामें गायें रातें</b><br><b>मस्ती में रहे डूबा-डूबा हमेशा समाँ</b>
They all used to do over acting.... that&#39;s what we can see here
Ye movie abhi bhi laptop mai padi hai...
Not good acting
Logically yeh scene sahi nai hai kyunki priya ne landline pe phone kiya tha aur same landline se Saif ne kch der pehle baat kiya, so how come priya viswas karegi ki Saif nai aaya aamir ke ghar think..
I got Married in 2001 this movie was released when i got engaged,  just 2 months bfore my marriage. It was an arranged marriage.  AFTER watching this i really missed my friends and time spent together. I was addicted to this movie that much  i even wanted to step back from my marriage. Holy shit 😂😂😂
Sameer ka breakup karvak rahega akaash
Saif &amp; Akshay were very good in this movie.  But Aamir was just phenomenal in the movie.
Kya kr rha hai yrr, dusri aankh bhi jaati 😂😂😂😂 Epic scene !!! DIL CHAHTA HAI is really an evergreen movie. Many of us can relate to it even in today&#39;s era. 😍
Childhood movie 😍
Did anyone noticed...? Sameer calls Priya from Aakash&#39;s home landline and after that Priya calls back at the same number and Aakash picks up. And she believes that Sameer was not with Aakash...😂😂😂😂
i remember those days when there was a trend in my school to give Dil Chahata Hai CD&#39;s to boys on their b-day&#39;s or whenever we want to have a new friend in the gang, gossshhh i miss those days.
Akshay khana is a great actor but just he doesn&#39;t get any scrript
Soch raah ho Rohit se dosti Karlun kam se protection mil jayega 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mard ban, be a man
<a href="https://zagred.com/VYpJQ">https://zagred.com/VYpJQ</a><br><br>dil boht bra h ap ka a dost
I was 2 years old when this movie got released, the world has changed so less
This movie completely transformed Saif....isey pehle bilkul ladki lagta tha....and his acting was almost on another level
People went bonkers with that soul patch, it was such an in thing back then 😄
One thing I just noticed, Saif is wearing a digital watch, how come a digital watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=100">1:40</a> can stop if the battery dies, the display will go off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=143">2:23</a> . Digital watches don&#39;t stop.
Kon kon is movie ko  2020 me dekhna  chahta hai
This movie will never get old PERIOD
Hi priya<br>Haan main<br>Magar wo<br>Suno to<br>Tumne to<br>Lekin main<br>Kabse keh<br>😂😂😂😂😂
Pitega sala😂😂😂
If this was in 2020 then title would have been : Pranked my friends girlfriend (GONE SEXUAL)
😃
Mard ban be a Men🤣🤣
Aamir and saif s chemistry in DCH ♥️♥️😂😂👌👌
Akshay Khanna had hairs that time! How time flies!
Please upload Saif Ali khan and Sonali Kulkarni hotel scene
who else hates this girl&#39;s guts?
Amir 😂😂😂
That&#39;s why i always says that girls don&#39;t have common sense.
Farhan Akhtar must  remake of this cult ...
Aamir khan mera jaan best actor ever <br>He can do anything for his movies🤙
It wil always remain alive...v wer same 3 friends n many of u might b too...wid same nautankis n mischiefs...dil chahata he wo din laut aaye.

Nostalgic 👽
Abe aalo Ghar pr phon karke bolte ho ki wo Ghar nahi aya. Toh thodi pehle call conference pe li thi kya
Bc bollywood me ab aisi filme kyu nahi banti..???<br>Inki maa ka bhosda sab chutiya banane k chakkar me hai..
Best scene of this movie

This movie has changed Bollywood completely.
आज पूजा, कल कोई दूजा। 😛😊😛😊😛😊
90s<br>   k yuva
Remember going to see this in a NYC theater and had no idea what I was about to see. I was blown away at the entire look and feel of it. It was refreshing and had a real feel. I think it was the first time they were using real time sync sound. It was a Game changer indeed! It did for movies, what DDLJ did for romance movies. Bravo!
Ye Saif aur Amir hey.<br>Akash ya Sameer nahi.<br>Chutiya ban rahey ho tum Hindu.
How&#39;re they dumbass 😂 they both (amir and saif ) talking with same phone and she didn&#39;t realize 😁😁
all time fav movie
Life me 1 baar dosto k saat goa jaana hai 😌😋<br>Aamirians like here👇
Yeh beard style Aamir se hi aaya hai😋😋

Isn&#39;t that a Cordless Landline Phone?
👍👍👍👍
This movie is relevant for all the times . <br>Best movie to watch always . 👏🏻👏🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Struggle dekh rahe ho woh time pe<br>Watch me time ki gaurantee nhi thi aur call kaha se Ata tha pata nhi chalta tha.
Taimur be like &#39;Papa aap kaise se the yaar. Koi bhi bnake nikal leta tha aapko&#39;
Kya film thi yaar yeh.😊 Aisa lagta hai jeise kal hi release hui ho.
Time was really great at that time,,<br>Aj 20 movie mila kar bhi Aisa ek movie nahi bana sakta,,kya ho gay Bollywood director and Indian public ko,,<br>I’m from Bangladesh,I was a big fan of Bollywood
Guys I really recommend style 2001 movie it&#39;s really underrated I remember I watched that on TV nowdays people don&#39;t even know that movie exist
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHq5ngJRB0&amp;t=295">4:55</a> he solved the Rubik’s cube
Though Aamir was a main lead but akshaye&#39;s performance was just next level 👍
Movie was way ahead of his time. When i saw it first 18 years ago on DVD i didn&#39;t like it because at that time fighting movies was ruling the bollywood. But with maturity and time it is now my fav movie of hindi cinema.
that&#39;s was one of my favorite movies list 🙂👌 just fantastic ☹
Movie ka spinoff series banao
Its like..joey,ross n chandler of Bollywood 😂😂
Life was so easy back then without mobiles..jaise inzamam ki interview ...online hai tho problem off line main bhi problem especially with wiifes..only words I hit I out I left I out same words
Somehow saif reminds me of kelso from that 70s show 😂 in this scene.
Sameer called her using aakash&#39;s phone,  she called back on the same phone and Aakash said sameer is not here and she trust him (rather we all) <br>That&#39;s how they make a fool of us.
Aishi dusri movie bhi banani chahiye,to like thoko
Evergreen movie...one of the best films made in bollywood
Master peace movie
Very close to my heart this movie is what cast and story
Because of this movie the craze of Goa in boys increases😂😂😂😂😂
Let&#39;s have more of these clips please <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nostalgia">#nostalgia</a>
That rubik cube shot at Aamir khan by Akshaye looked really dangerous. Someone should ask them in an interview how was this scene shot and did Akshaye almost made an error.
There&#39;s only 1 word to describe this movie. Fresh. Never ages.
Who wants to watch this movie again in theatre in 2020?
The way Akshay wink I always try to copy
Yahi se wo suru huva<br>Har 1 friend kamina hota hai.<br>😄😄😄
90s youth had wrist watches. No mobiles...this gen has no wrist watch only mobiles
Abhi kaun haramkhor 37 log jo is movie ko hate  kiya. Abhe kutte Canada ka visa laga nahin aur ghar basane ke sapne dekhte.
The Trio  was simply superb
Dil Chahta hai and Zindagi Na milegi doobara jaisi movie Ka part 2 banana chayiee
When Aamir says pitega saala....
Excel movies was always ahead of its time...DIL CHATA HAI, LAKSHYA it would have been superhit if relased now....if you agree.
Hahahaha! Such a classic scene! One of the best movies of all time ❤️
Can you re release this movie??? In theatres
Absolute cult.. even in 2020!!<br>Hit .. not on chick of Sam!!👌🤩
This movie never gets old
I love akshaye’s character....wo wala frnd jo group me sb ki sunta h 😍
I still couldn’t believe this movie was made almost 19 years ago. This movie is still relevant and youngsters will be able to connect to it even in today’s time.
A film that should have been released in 2020 !!
Bhai iska next part bhi bnao..🙏😍
These movie man kitne frnds ka dream trio hoga jo Goa janeka plan banayenge honge
They say Aamir is short, but he is as tall as Akshyae and Saif
Best movie.❤️
This is a movie, which is very close to my heart
This movie is still modern today  ❤️
I think Iska bhi remake hone wala hai...🤔😪
Ever and ever my all time Fevrt Movei <br>Dil Chahta Hai <br>and Zindagi Na Milengi Dobara <br><br>thank You So Much Farhan For making Such a Beautiful Movies ❤
so if he called her from Akash&#39;s Cordless/phone .. shouldn&#39;t this be a clear sign that he was indeed at Akash&#39;s house then?
Still watching this scene in 2020...sameer😂🤣😂
❤❤❤❤
Never gets old
Movie way ahead of it&#39;s time.... This movie changed the lifestyle of the people&#39;s, changed the hairstyles, changed the way of dressing, changed the way of thinking, changed the taste of movies....
