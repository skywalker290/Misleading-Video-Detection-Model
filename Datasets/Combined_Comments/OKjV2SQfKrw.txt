Where was the goalkeeper for the Germans
World cup winner: off from the group stages
if germany won this match even 1-0, they would have been through
2018: South Korea beat Germany<br>2022: Japan beat Germany (and Spain)
One word : Overconfidence !!

mesut was scapegoated after germany failure of this WC, but you can see their problem wasn&#39;t on him at all.

ألمانيا وايطاليا منتخبات لها تاريخ كبير لكن في الاونه الاخيره خفت بريقهما
당시 피파랭킹 1위 독일이 이때부터 쭉 내리막길.. 멤버들만 놓고봐도 최소 4강이상갔을 전력인데 독일인들 충격이 얼마나컷을지 상상도 안된다..
What was keeper doing?

Complete garbage performance n team selection on German part
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKjV2SQfKrw&amp;t=82">1:22</a> Fue una irresponsabilidad de Kroos.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKjV2SQfKrw&amp;t=95">1:35</a> Pero la de Neuer fue más clara que la de Kroos.
YEAHHHHHH KOREA, KOREA, KOREAAAAAAAA
🤣
Why was Neuer there 😂😂😂
The speed of my son, who scored the second goal, did not decline at all even in the extra time of the second half.😮
16강을 떠나 너무나도 최선을 다해준 한국 대표팀의 모습이 자랑스럽고 빛이나네요. 뭉클❤<br>수천년동안 강대국 사이에서 나라를 지켜냈던 그 한민족의 투지가 그대로 보였습니다😂
Thank you Korean brothers for defeating Germany, these Germans will forever feel entitled to dominating Asians and constantly dating Asian women while labeling Asian men as feminine. All Asians should stand together to combat white male supremacy. Fighting!
South korea👏 🇰🇷
Korea was sinking... but sinking with the former world cup champion !!!  hahahaha

Who are here in 2023 ...... Fan of Germany football team 🇩🇪 ( EURO 2024 GERMANY 🇩🇪 VS FRANCE 🇨🇵 THE FINAL 😉) 💚
I remember being so satisfied back then that Neuer finally got punished for leaving his line in the world cup. That guy was so frustrating to watch as a supporter of the opposite team during the &#39;14 wc
what was that Germany goalkeeper doing
The 2nd goal ended Germany&#39;s whole career
I occasionally come back for this video. Germany was the defending champion and ranked #1, and South Korea&#39;s performances in the two previous games were underwhelming so I thought it would be an easy win for Germany. Living evidence that if you keep pushing forward, miracles indeed happen.
The saddest thing about this lost was how Mesut gave his all, created chance after chance, watched his team missed sitters, while carried all the hate he got for political reasons. Only to end his national career with immeasurable hatred by the very same people he gave that joy in 2014.
이게 5년전이구나...볼 때마다 가슴이 뜨거워진다..
Feliz 🇰🇷🇩🇪🇯🇵🇧🇪

This WC had one of the best group stages ever. Better than 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014 easily but Qatar did overtake it. I remember watching this at my office in central London and the entire multinational workforce were cheering for Korea and happy that Germany were out
웃긴 사실: 경기가 끝난 후, 손흥민을 비롯한 대한민국의 선수들은 16강에 진출한줄 알고 기쁨의 눈물을 흘렸지만(독일을 2점차로 이겨야 한다는 조건 충족)<br>멕시코가 스웨덴과의 경기에서 패배해, 그들의 눈물은 신기루가 되었다.<br>웃긴 사실2: 스웨덴과의 경기에서 패배한 멕시코에서는 대한민국이 독일을 2점차로 이길 가능성이 없어서 체념하였지만 이것이 실현되어 16강에 진출하게 되자<br>주변의 모든 동양인들에게 대한민국인이냐고 확인하여 그들을 형제로 대우하였고, 이 열기를 취재하던 대한민국 방송사의 리포터는 생방송 중 멕시코 여자들에게 키스세례를 받는것이 화제였다.
Foolish Germany!  😂 Over excitement had hampered them
진출에는 실패했지만 지난월드컵 챔피언을 2:0으로 이긴게 참 자랑스러웠다
SLAYYYYY
Even after lost, germany still not accept, Asian better than them
Did Germany used all of their goals on Brazil that one time or what?
Neuer now is playing as midfield player 😂

Brazil national team and messi curse germany
2018 was a tough year for Germany
As a Korean, to this day I don’t understand how Korea won this game
Dude Manuel Neuer😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKjV2SQfKrw&amp;t=95">1:35</a>
Dieses Spiel ist ein Spiegelbild der Politik dieser RAFfGIERung hierzulande.

Who’s here after Germany out of wwc?
Aaand the Korean Women’s team did the same thing in this year’s Women’s World Cup 😂
Germany futbol fans must hate us 😂 sorry ya&#39;ll
2023: Women&#39;s World Cup Korea equalise Germany, and Germany fails to proceed to knockout match
De javu 😂😂😂
Again Korea did it in 2023 women disqualified Germany l😂
I won&#39;t be surprised if Germany banned Korea from traveling to Germany. Because it got like a pain now it has become a conflict.
I am here after the south Korean women team kicked Germany out . <br>thank you South Korea men &amp; women may you always bring joy to the world  and kick Germany again in the next tournaments
In 2023 women world cup, the Germany was eliminated in the group stage after a 1-1 draw to South Korea while Morocco beat Colombia 1-0.
2018: Korea Republic men&#39;s team eliminates Germany from the World Cup<br><br>2023: Korea Republic women&#39;s team eliminates Germany from the World Cup <br><br>Deja Vu
Here after history repeat itself with both Germany &amp; South Korea for their Women Team this time 🤣
It’s a delight to watch Germany lose
2018 World Cup: Korea exited from the group stage but the Koreans brought Germany out of the game as well. <br>2023 Women&#39;s World Cup: Korea also exited from the group stage but once again, the Koreans also had to bring Germany out of the game as well. <br>Same vibe.
South Korea is Germany&#39;s killer 😂
came back to this after south korea womens team tied germany to knock them out of the group stage 😂🎉
Korea and Germany are out again.<br>Germany is afraid of Korea
Who is here after South Korea 1-1 Germany from Women World Cup?
Women&#39;s world cup result reminded me of this game.
mulker needs cooler ...
Sweden beats Korea Mexico beats Germany
Germany vs south korea 2023 women this time must be a coincidence impossible for South Korea women to eleminate Germany while moroco and Colombia ties 1:1
Neuer become no ear no year
&quot;Two nil, that is it!&quot; 😅💀
Την Ιαπωνια θα την κερδιζε 2-1  αλλα αν επαιζαν το 2023 θα εχανε με σκορ 3-1
Κορεα 🥅⚽️🏆
Γερμανια😂😂😂
Και με την Ισπανια 2-0
Αν επαιζε η Κορεα με την Γερμανια στο Καταρ το σκορ θα ηταν 4-0
If anything, this world cup has the best match highlights. 2022&#39;s match highlights can&#39;t compare
the Brilliant Korean coach is Sin Tae Yong.
Come to think of it. <br>2018 FIFA World Cup, South Korea met Germany in the last round of group stage. <br>2023 FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup, South Korea is also going to meet Germany in the last round of the group stage. <br>Coincidence.
I’m not Argentine but as an Argentina fan I would just like to say, thank you South Korea. 🇦🇷🤝🇰🇷
Hawn-empire become again
My old man said it was payback for the 7-1 they pulled on Brazil in 2014.
Everytime they wear green kit they lose
한국이 월드컵에서 당시 세계랭킹 1위를  꺾은 경기

Sty bersinar <br>Skrg dah redup
Korean GK was like Emi Martinez
I&#39;m feeling happy.
No. The reason why it&#39;s count was the pass before from Kroos so there is no offside at all
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKjV2SQfKrw&amp;t=95">1:35</a> neuer is now playing as a midfield player!!
그로부터 4년이 흐르고, 독일은 대한민국의 이웃이자 라이벌한테도 개박살나고, 스페인한테 다득점에 밀려서 2회 연속으로 조별리그에서 탈락하고 마는데...
2023년에도 이 하이라이트 보는 사람 손!
5 years the champion curse never ever Germany never lost😮
Happy 5th Anniversary of this game! 🇰🇷🇩🇪23
What was Neuer thinking man 😂
Arguably the most entertaining game in the 2018 World Cup.  Just incredible.  Bravo Korea!
It&#39;s common germany lost in Russia 💀
Germans didn&#39;t know this is just the beginning of their nightmare

&quot;노이어 없어요!!&quot;
Almost 5 years later, and Neuer playing in midfield gets me every time 💀☠️
This game is crazy.
This is what you germans deserve after running up and spitting on us swedes when you scored the winning goal against us in the 90+5th minute.
Why was neuer playing in midfield?
중요한건 꺾이지 않는 마음
Lets say germany is failed to qualify for the ko stages 2 straight wc<br>What about italy they failed to qualify for 2 wc<br>( i am a italian)
Mesot ozil was the guy who gave world cup to Germany but now without him Germany can not win any match 😂😂
Korea’s goalkeeper last year was amazing really.

I don&#39;t remember watching this match before but I wanna ask. Why is Germany goalkeeper all the way up in the field at the end instead of defending the goal?
Biggest loss for germany shameful
2018 defeated from asia  team south korean<br><br>2022 defeated  from asia team japan
Now Germany don&#39;t want Asian team in their group 😂
South Korea dragged Germany out of the group stage in this match.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKjV2SQfKrw&amp;t=70">1:10</a> the german team was absent mind.
South Korea was very happy, even though they also go home with Germany.. 🤣🤣
So embarrassing to win a world cup then 4 years later not even making it to the rounds of 16.

As a Brazilian I have a lot to thank Korea, Germany is paying for 7:1

the only one i feel bad abt is özil

gERMANY failed twice in 2018 and 2022 to pass through second round. Whats the issue? If one notices germany never plays like germany! this is because the new players are not foddered from typical german school of football thought.The 2022 team no player is German origin.

I skipped out a lot of saves by the SK keeper while Son did miss quite a bit. The keeper was the MVP.
As of 2022, Germany goes home before 16 round is no longer a surprise. They still didn&#39;t get better this time
Let&#39;s face it. Everyone tried this with their goalkeeper on either FIFA or PES as a kid 😂

Who’s here after Germany got eliminated
Here we go again...
Who&#39;s here After Germany vs Costa Rica? 😁
South Korea the beast
South korea is best 🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
This time Costa Rica.
We gotta give a lot of credit to Son Heung-Min. To catch up to that ball at the speed he was running and to get that perfect touch to hit it in. It&#39;s a lot harder than it seems especially considering the magnitude of the game; the world cup against Germany, the defending champions, with a win meaning you send them home. Well done.
What&#39;s the name of this commentator ?
Hope Korea can beat Spain in the last game..go Korea👍👍🇰🇷from Indonesia.. and make Asia Proud👍👍
I laughed so hard when son scored and noone was at the net 😂
this year&#39;s world cup, Germany lost to Japan
Son 😍
Korea republic goals 😍😍😍
South Korea Sorry for not supporting at first
Last time South Korea<br>This time Japan<br>Yayyy!!
나도 할 수 있는데
Korean 100 vamos
Korean 100 vamos
So surprise Korea won this game but couldn&#39;t go to tournament. Mexico, Sweden went to tournament back then.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKjV2SQfKrw&amp;t=8">0:08</a> that save was actually amazing world class recovery by neuer
Now they need another miracle against Portugal - another European Team?
Mesut özili görünce anladım gundilik oldğunu
And now JAPAN 😭🤣🤣
이번 월드컵에도  독일이 일본에게 패배했습니다.독일은 아시아 국가에게 취약하네요
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKjV2SQfKrw&amp;t=95">1:35</a> how I liked that goal
Manual neur playing for korea
The day that the whole world was happy. Except for Germany.
ㅆ발 국뽕 떨어질때마다 온다 ㄹㅇㅋㅋ
But remember 2014 Germany 🥶
Came back to watch this after seeing Germany lose to Japan.
I come from 2022 to say that France has broken the curse of world champions in Qatar
May be Germany will go home again2022 world cup japan will send home
Congrats Japan 🇯🇵🇰🇷👍
I am one of korean but almost no one expected that Korea will won.Even Korean and in Korean betting the possibility was almost 0.2% but korea did it😄
France is breaking the curse this time around!
Well played korea 💞
history repeats itself
Cant believe, 4 years ago ozil was a top player.
And now they’ve done it again in Qatar!
Who&#39;s here after watching Japan&#39;s dramatic comeback vs Germany??
Here after Germany fumbled to yet another asian team this time Japan
Hello
Says the trash english
who is here after japan beats germany😂
Classic moment ❤️❤️
Neuer playing as a midfield player feels like out of a fifa game
Apply the same logic of that first south korean goal to the Belgium V. Canada game then Canada should&#39;ve had a penalty after hazard passed the ball back
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I remember watching this when I was in last year if highschool, literally one of the best matches I&#39;ve seen
🗿Too many referees in the game
Well all I can see is Germany better do not play asian teams
Olivia culpo, boto!🇺🇲
Who’s here after Japan beat Germany 2-1
This time Germany slaped by the Japan...😄 Definitely will go home soon
Germany always loses to Asians(South Korea,Japan)

The first champion team which had 2-losing-streaks against Asia 😆
Coming back to see this replay after Japan beating Germany four years later.
I’m a new football fan so I don’t really understand why the Germany goalkeeper left goal wide open.
Who is here again after yesterday&#39;s german loss?🍻

Almost 4.5 years later, Japan gave Germany a second consecutive FIFA World Cup defeat! Seems like the AFC has replaced Italy as German football&#39;s new boogeyman in international tournaments!
韓国も頑張ってほしい！応援してます🔥
독일 뭐해 이새기야!!
독일아 고맙다 재밌는 경기 만들어줘서
Japan has given a jolt today 😂😂

🇰🇷❤️🇯🇵😂
The Germans then committed the unthinkable mistakes —especially Neuer— they tried power play to wage one final battle against Korea and Japan.<br><br>They fought ferociously,but were utterly defeated.<br><br>They didn&#39;t realize that times had changed.<br>Facing one defeat after another, losing   Their prestiges and watching their nation dwindle.
Victory for Korea four years ago and for Saudi Arabia and Japan this time! Definitely, Asian soccer is evolving!!😆
Japan not only cleaned the stands, they also cleaned the stadium😂🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🔥🔥👏🏻
ドイツも4年間一生懸命練習してアジアから1点取り返せるようになって良かったね😊
germany too easy 😂
🇯🇵❤️🇰🇷🇯🇵❤️🇰🇷🇯🇵❤️🇰🇷
스페인은 벌써 골잔치. 독일은 어쩌다 이렇게 되었나? 차붐 의견이 듣고 싶다.
That was disastrous but hey, at least be optimistic. Germany won&#39;t lose to any Asian team in the future, right?
2026<br>China 2 : 0 germany
LOL, same thing happened again 4 years later
2018<br>🇰🇷 2-0 🇩🇪<br>2022<br>🇯🇵 2-1 🇩🇪<br> <br>Asia is Germany&#39;s kryptonite

16+ LV
본선 3경기 초등학생 축구부 수준의 졸전을 벌여서 국민적인 비난이 있던 대표팀. 마지막 수세에 몰린 독일을 꺾었다고 좋아하는 것은 부끄럽다.
Brings back memories when South Korea embarrassed Germany and knocked them out the world cup in 2018.
이때 진짜 역대급이었음 ㅠ <br>16강 기적을 이뤄보자 !
저도 정국노래듣다가   여기까지 왔어요 <br>아 . 흥민선수 눈물난다 .

Can i understand why the german keeper was way on the other side lol
🇰🇷
The Korean Goalkeeper was soo focused and outstanding 👏 <br>The sk defenders were like militants
I love korea
🇰🇷 KOR
I literally miss the old Germany-Team, and 2014 line up was the best for sure.
국뽕 빼고봐도 ㅈㄴ 잘한 경기 <br>물론 독일이 못한것도 있지만 스쿼드부터 한국이랑 넘사급으로 차이날 정도여서 이변일수밖에 없는 경기
Hopefully Korea will go to the round of 16 this year and be surprised, it would be nice to see them happy
Germany beat Brazil 1-7 in 2014, and they didn’t get through the qualifying stages in 2018, wonder how they’ll do now
No Germany you are not the best at everything 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nuer acting like he’s playing fifa on easy mode
I remember this when everyone in Mexico were playing bts songs to thank Korea💗
Still remember this lol
South Korea vs German record<br>1994 WC Group 2:3<br>2002 WC Semifinal 0:1<br>2004 Friendly match 3:1<br>2018 WC Group 2:0

Hahahaha 🎉 🇧🇷
Korea is really underrated team.
신도 예상 못 할 혼돈의 조 ㅎㄷㄷ
Lololol 2022 will be the same
For anyone who sees this, this match gives Korea hope for 2022.  If they beat Germany, they definitely have a chance against Uruguay and Portugal.
댓글 최신순으로해서 한국인찾을려고?
Koreano hermano, ya eres mexicano. Much love to Korea from Mexico 🇰🇷🇲🇽❤️❤️
Korea 🇳🇵❤️❤️
This is why football is the most exciting sport in the WORLD!!!!🤩👍🏼
Korea only one Asian countries beat 3 world champion Italy Germany Spain and euro champion Portugal.

i want to see extraordinary events like this in this worldcup.
Soy un coreano que vive en los Estados Unidos y recuerdo este día con claridad. Solía trabajar en una taquería y todos mis compañeros de trabajo son mexicanos y cuando digo TODOS me dijeron que “te amo y amo a tu país.” Estaba feliz de que ganaran pero fue obvio que significaba más para todos mis compañeros porque México podían avanzar a la próxima ronda. Nunca he recibido tantos abrazos y besos en mi vida. 😂
Most funny part, germany are going home
South Korean goalie Cho for this particular match, was basically Yashin with a combination of Gods&#39; protection.
Germany is not the best anymore
As a germany fan, this was a tough watch. i had started supporting them in the 2010 world cup, and with the 2014 win and fairly solid performance in the intermittent years i really thought they could pull off a back to back win.<br><br>but, thats the drama of the greatest game. brilliant plays by mexico and korea and, lets be honest, terrible plays by german made their bed. they havent been doing too well since then but i am hopeful that they will at least make it to the quarterfinals this year.
كوريا انتقمت للبرازيل من المانيا 😂
Mexicans love Koreans, they are our brothers
Oh
From 7-1 to being disclassificated by South Korea (who also didn&#39;t advance). Last in group table, didn&#39;t play knockout phase. As a Brazilian, I had so much pleasure watching this match. I supported Croatia in knockout phase. Modric was a beast at this World Cup, I look foward to see how is he gonna play now at this edition.
Germany got humiliated lol
I remember this match because there was no goalkeeper
i remember watching this live it was insane
독일은 우습지
Koreans neverrrrr give up.<br>Although we dont make it to the tournament, we dont let others qualify for round of 16
Imagine all the Asian people who aren’t S.Korean but stilled got carried by a bunch of Mexicans for giving them the pass for the next stage. Y’all should be happy lol.
I got a feeling Korea will be the next world cup champion
Bahagia rasanya Jerman kalah melawan Korea Selatan 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Blue lock vibes

All we can do is pray this happens again to Germany and they lose again in the group stages!
This world cup was epic, Brazil got to see being avenged by Korea and Korea showing true talent.
Where was the goalkeeper in the 2nd goal?
XD
The Korean goal keeper was like a Wall to germany, which they cannot Break
Defending the World Cup is virtually impossible. Just shows how incredible Brazil&#39;s achievement in &#39;62 was.<br><br>I would love to see a team like South Korea or Japan go all the way.
I remember back when i was watching this match with my dad who is a german fan. He was like, &quot;wth korea you already lost, just let them score already&quot; and i remember all hope was shattered when korea scored XD Truly an unforgettable moment
Still remember this match. S Korea showed it&#39;s grit against an overconfident Germany. I was so proud of S Korea
🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾❤️❤️❤️
Where is the german’s goalkeeper in the second goal?
Shin tae yong
독일과는 50년간 경기하지 말자!!!...이 경기를  계속 써먹게....
The assist for the second goal was absolutely amazing 🤩.Many wont notice that
I’ll never forgive the Mexicans losing to sweden
Last match of ozil
Now that is world class goal keeping from korea ❤
very satisfying to see germany knocked out in group stages
Karma played its part 🤣 they humiliated Brazil and the immediate next cup they got kicked out that too  being defending champions
Germany vs South Korea and Barcelona vs Chelsea are David vs Goliath.
I just don&#39;t know how France is gonna be knocked out of 2022 wc
this is more than to be a winner for Korean Republic. the best match ever❤
I guess Germany can&#39;t win on russian soil, how ironic
Man Made History 🤞

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKjV2SQfKrw&amp;t=96">1:36</a> Neuer now is playing as a midfield player 😄😄
It is very outstanding performance.
엌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
역사에 남을 경기였지. 당시 독일은 이겨야 되는 절박한 상태였으니..우리나라가 승산 자체가 없다는게 중론이였는데 이번 월드컵도 궁금해지네.
씨발 이때가 너무 그립다. 우리나라가 월드컵에서 이런 강팀을 잡을 날이 또 올까

Humiliation just huge Humiliation for Germany 😁
I can&#39;t believe our country is the winner of this game. That&#39;s amazing!
What a game. Korea were absolutely cold.
If the first goal counts, then it is amazing that the Everton goal against Liverpool can be ruled offside. Clearly shows the mediocre levels of refereeing in the EPL.

오랜만에 다시 보러옴 이번 월드컵은 좋은 성과가 있기를
Neuer outside from his goal 😂😂
No korean will forget this ever...... One of the best group stage&#39;s matches ......
The germans would not have lost if the goalie had not made a run
I asking Germaney u are  remember the 2014 world cup 7/1 <br>It&#39;s revenge the Korea 😂
A horrible day. Before the match, a feeling of dread in the bus taking us to the stadium. Then during the match, I had my head down for minutes because I was so afraid. And looked up to see the Koreans score the two goals.
the goal was empty lol
독일쯤이야..,

Muy bien coreanos, pero en Qatar 2022 deberán perder si o si todos sus partidos, porque me he enterado de que te discriminan allá cuando vas a entrar a las discotecas, y no será ninguna sorpresa si en esa liga de fútbol en Corea practican la xenofobia :/
On this day, I couldn&#39;t control my joy and banged my head on the ceiling with amazing jumping power. I was so happy that I didn&#39;t feel any pain.<br><br>And it was the first time I knew that I had such a jumping ability.<br><br>Will there be a miracle like this in this Qatar World Cup?<br><br>I&#39;m worried, but I&#39;ll still support my country
😭
Neuer was literally playing outside bru 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
This is crazy to witness
so proud of this match
son
Who&#39;s watching this now? <br>My subscribers are!
according to croatian korea
croatia vs korea republic
This is not the first time Germany lost in Russia 🤣
but wait Belgium defeat Japan the asian nations
El arquero tuvo que bajar para ayudar a su equipo, pero en un error suyo se descuidó y el coreano lo aprovechó.
There is not Austria to save German <br>Who Remember w Germany vs Austria 1982 ?
114 Days to go until 2022 World Cup!
Pocos leeran esto, pero la felicidad de ver a Son hoy día en el Totteham es increíble gracias a ese último gol, gracias Son por todas esas felicidades ♥️
Nice match .
Germany would have to win by a gap of 2 goals, otherwise this wouldn’t have mattered. Thats why after the first south korean goal, german goalkeeper came forward to play as a striker. There is no other reason why they would have lost 2-0 to a team like korea
O dia que o Brasil sorriu!
People are watching this video over and over again because they are enjoying Germany&#39;s humiliating defeat. 2022 we are counting  on you Japan👍
This game is extra meaningful for Team Korea, since this marks the end of the dark age of the national team.<br>There have been many ups and downs since 2002 World Cup: many managers came and went, and various experiments taken to end the downfall. Of course, during this time Korea won the 2012 Olympic Bronze after the desperate match with the archrival which is Japan; however, the public interest in football in Korea was dropping steadily which was the worst news of all.<br>I remember that moment. It was midnight in Suwon. Everything was against Team Korea, already lost two games and facing the next big opponent we call &quot;the Panzer Corps.&quot; Most went to sleep, many bet on Germany, and only veterans-turned-commentators were saying &quot;Could be worse. Who knows?&quot; I, also lost interest in A matches, was playing video games instead.<br>Nearly two hours later, a loud burst of scream followed by confused voices was heard from neighbors. Bit annoyed, I started watching the stream to find out what happened. I doubted what I&#39;ve witnessed, but the screen was clearly showing KOR 1. The champion was losing. Germany looked so desperate in the last minutes sending the GK front midfield. Then, a long pass to the empty German side. Son followed the ball like a maniac and managed to reach. Another goal! &quot;What the Red Devil magic is this?&quot;<br>Tigers wrecked the Tanks. It didn&#39;t matter that Korea failed to advance to knockout stage; the team brought even bigger. This single game couldn&#39;t crumble the throne, but it left a deep scar on it. Celebration messages came from all around the world, mostly from Mexico and Brazil. Everyone was happy except Germans. What an unforgettable night.
South Korea is like: &quot;if we&#39;re going out, we are taking you with us!!&quot;
The day Mexicans were Koreans.
Best Asian team for a reason 🔥🔥
When you couldn&#39;t buy the referees this time *
hay lắm hàn quốc
Proud of korea south.. my country...
Biggest upset in World Cup history since the start of the 21st century with Slovakia beating 2006 Champions Italy at 2010 World Cup winning 3-2 and send the Italians home.
So satisfying to watch.

Germany were ranked #1 in the world at this time so it’s no surprise to me that it meant a lot for South Korea.  Plus, I am a huge fan of Son.  He’s one of the best players in the world in my opinion.  I support a rival at club level (Liverpool) but I can’t help but admire how much of a legend he is for Tottenham.  He was easily up there as one of the best players of last season for me.
언제 봐도 기분 좋아지는 영상이다 으하하하
Özil was the best player in that team undoubtebly! and they fooked him up
معجزة كروية
Son is the best
o brasil todo gostou disso
We will always remember this game since it’s shocking that Germany has lost.

There should be a trophy along the lines of &quot;Champion slayer&quot; award for the country that eliminates the current world cup winners

그때 미쳤었는데
Humiliating, textbook example of overconfidence
that&#39;s the day every east / south-east Asian is South Korean in Mexico.
war crime racism country germany
World cup 2014 : Germany won Brazil 7 - 1 .<br>But World cup 2018 : Germany lose South Korea ( a football team &quot;not strong&quot; come to Asia ) 1 - 2 .<br><br>The life is a long journey , future and the life of everyone can change , a football team also like it . <br>Success and happy in today , future not sure can hold it .
손흥민 최고🤍🤍
2010 South Africa defeat France<br>2018 South Korea defeat Germany
인종차별 당한 손흥민 선수의 독일에 대한 복수를 또다시 보러 왔습니다.
Son Heung-min (30, Tottenham) confessed that he suffered racism in Germany in the past and picked the match that defeated Germany at the World Cup as the best game in his football life.<br> &quot;There are actually many reasons. Other friends can say that we beat the German team, which is ranked No. 1 in the world, so it&#39;s a memorable game for me.&quot;<br>He recalled his memories, saying, &quot;I went to Germany when I was young. I had a very difficult life that I could not have imagined. I suffered a lot of racism and was in a difficult situation...&quot;<br>Son Heung-min said, &quot;I think I had a lot of thoughts that I had to pay this back one day while I was going through a very difficult situation (in Germany). In my heart,&quot; he said.
just come back to watch how Son put all Germans in tears for revenging his suffered of racism.
This time the new Germany squad under Flick should win most of their games in the next world cup
Indian Flag , in this stadium what a worldcup and salute to the person and group who raise Indian Flag there 🫡 🇮🇳
im pretty sure oneday asian country will win world cup
2002년 월드컵 이 후로 최대의 환호와 환희를 보냈던 경기다...

독일 사람들이 진짜 젠틀맨인게 저 경기 후에도 좌절하거나 화 안내고 축하해주고 위로해주더라... 진짜 국민성이 나라의 선진성을 보여주는구나... respect 🇩🇪!
난 당시 군복무 중이라 이 경기를 못봤는데 자고 일어나니 2:0으로 이겼다길래 귀를 의심했다
How can Germany lose to South Korea?
if this is the republic korea then the north is the empire korea?
😂😂😂😂😂
Wait so germany beat the brasil like 7-1 or something but korea beats germany 2-0 😂

South Korea played like Mexico did against Brazil in 2014. They went the distance, even when they were counted out.
O brasil será sempre grato a Coreia do sul. 🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
How tf did this first goal count and Benzema against Liverpool 2022 didn&#39;t???????????

Poor germany 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a game, all of goals were in 90m more. S Korea just pushing hard at the end.

이거 보고 있는 한국인 나와라
한국은 독일을 2018년에 2:0으로 이겼지만 이미 그전에 2004년에 3:1로 이겼기에 별로 놀라운건 아니다.
Корейцы показали немцам как играть футбол...

Depois da goleada de 2014 eu aposto que a Alemanha era favorita em 2018
still dont understand why they celebrated that hard. They didnt make it into the round of 16 either

1994년 2002년 월드컵 복수 성공
F german
I&#39;m korean. I&#39;m hoping for Germany. 이번 월드컵에선 절대 방심하지 말고, 일본전 최선을 다해주길. 한국전의 복수를 일본에게 하길 바람. I expect 🇩🇪(5) vs 🇯🇵(0). 뮐러가 일본과의 경기에서 헤트트릭하고, 노이어는 무실점 경기를 하길. 이 글을 보고 있는 독일인은 이것을 반드시 해낼 수 있다고 글 남겨 주세요.
어차피 일본에는 손흥민이 없다.  강팀 상대로는 사실상 점유율 내준다 생각하고 한번에 역습으로 공격 해야하는데 역습 특화된 선수도 일본에 없고,  그 한번 찾아온 기회를 안 놓치고 넣을만한 결정력을 지닌 선수도 없다.  ㅅㄱ
ドイツを倒したいので日本に孫興民をくださいオッパ

Ozil was magnificent this game, but every other German player was so flat footed and out of it. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKjV2SQfKrw&amp;t=69">1:09</a>, you have 4 German defenders just watching this South Korean donnie take his time with a first touch and a finish past Neuer and none of them do anything.
