Super man bhai

I also liked Byomkesh Bakhshi. Actually I loved it. The way he characterized a Bengali without being an actual Bengali.<br><br>N.B.: Another Bengali took his life. Shame 😢
He is the ONE, always. ❤️

Justice For Sushant Singh Rajput
HE BASICALLY TRIED TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD JUST ENJOY &amp; DO WHAT WE LOVE.
After 2 years of your death we don&#39;t get what we want. Only we learn so many things from u, and still learning but it creats our anxiety, heavyness of heart that u r dead, we can&#39;t see you physically  in this world. I shed tears everytime I think of u. The set of emotions I have it is difficult to express, it but I will do my best. I want to convey my emotions to the world whom I know, I want to tell how much this injustice hurts me, how much your death broke me, how much I love u, respect u, missing u, who r u for me and why I m so sensitive for u but I never dared to say these all, because there r no one who can understand these emotions, if I find someone who is like me I definitely say everything. But I want u brother to tell u. But this is dream I understand. Somewhere I believe in God time, nothing is in our hand . <br><br>also taught me, leave everything on God and be in present live your life without any insecurity of future. And I m doing it but the thought of loosing a great philosopher like u, I kind , gentleman like u my heart become so heavy. Sushant u were someone whom I want in my life but it&#39;s too late when I recognize u now I can only cry, vlam destiny, regret on myself, curse those evils who snachtched u. That&#39;s it. I&#39;m trying to go on your path. I&#39;m happy because I know somehow u will born again in a beautiful life and because of our dua for u u will blessed with beautiful people around u. Sush u did so much for this world and we pray for u all these things give beautiful result one day in a different life. Wherever u will born my dua is always for u sushant. I miss u a lot my idol, and I love u more today... God bless u my sunshine...
SSR rip
Beautiful  speech  of  essence  of  human  life  very   very  eye  opening   speech .  Great  speech  by  you  SIR .
I have never seen such humble gentleman as film star from Bollywood industry. Thank you for uploading the video.god bless you.😊❤️🙏🕉️🔱
Can&#39;t believe this genius actually fell for dumbo ankita 🤪
what a gem of a speech !!
How many Sushant fans are watching this by now😁
This boy was going to be the next big thing, an Indian-looking Indian actor, hardworking, rooted, humble, and yet aspiring to reach the sky through hard work and perseverance, a true &#39;son of the soil&#39;, pride of all those who ever crossed his path of that I am certain. For 10 years he stayed in Bollywood without being &#39;of Bollywood&#39;, and I am sure he irked many. I never followed up with the case, but whatever the verdict, I am certain he wasn&#39;t a patient of depression, had strong black magic done on him, possibly using his birth chart by powerful practitioners of witchcraft. I have been through the experience, and know what it feels like. It is easy to blame Rhea, but I think she entered his life in 2019 when it was already too late, and she faced the brunt of it.
I always came here to listen his speech 😭😭😭
Life is so unfair
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTpOyqD4omw&amp;t=1140">19:00</a>
Sorry my love, it&#39;s not important everyone is loyal for u who crying since the day u left, someone pretend to became ssrians, but don&#39;t know why they do such a stupid things which ruin your image, or make fun of u, it hurts when some so called fake ssrians make your fun on social media, being very loyal and honest for u, I never want to do such things which harm your Image, even I don&#39;t talk to anyone about you,
Ssr❤❤🔥🔥
😍 you sushanth sir
Sushant 😚
Sushant Singh Rajput sir was very good human ❤️❤️❤️❤️ come back sir please 😭😭😭
Who is watching this in August 2021...Justice for sushant singh rajput
Yahi sushi ki life ki sbse badi galti thi jo usne acting ka rasta choose kia
What a humble soul! Asked the organizers for the permission to sit on that sofa.. M
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕😭
We lave you anyways
#@it&#39;sSSR always alive in my heart
Hatts  off to you sir love you and miss you ❣❣❣👑
Wellll said Gem 💎😍❤️
Sushant was a Great legend
The line when he said &quot;not son of khan&#39;s n kapoor&#39;s really appreciable&quot;👍👍
He is still alive in our heart man!
We miss you ssr plz back
Hats off too this guy..too inspiring but unfortunately he was made to go through things I possibly can&#39;t think off... Bollywood deserves what they are going through ...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTpOyqD4omw&amp;t=2131">35:31</a> 😄
You make me a strong person dude, don&#39;t know how I say thanks. You did a lot for your people. Tum jate jate aisi cheej hme de gye jisne hme zindagi me age bdhne ka rasta dikha gye. When I look up to u I see a strong, pure soul. They are trying to make u looser, make u depressed and weak but u don&#39;t allowed them to do it, even they kill u when they think u can&#39;t go down, but again your soul is there and they are suffering what they did with u. My dear guide us always because your guidance is needed. I have a lot of people around me who make me in trouble sad, I have a lot of problems in my life but when these things make me weak I recites your thoughts,, what I lived if my life is going smoothly without thorns and difficulties, today pain is only the medicine which make us stronger,,, hats off to u. You win us my love. Now I can proudly say I am biggest fan of yours. Sushant Singh Rajput &quot;&quot;this name make us strong, fearless, it&#39;s a emotion for us, we r being extremely sensitive for u. If country will not punished your criminals, agencies, govt. Don&#39;t give u justice, then they will watch, what public will do, what public will do if there is injustice in the country. We r ready to create a big battle for truth, and we will win. Because at the end truth will wear the cloth of victory.... This battle is for a pure soul who was killed because he went against bad people, he want to exposed dirty secrets.
Even after 1 year of his death don&#39;t know why it still feels like a personal loss
Still watch all your vedios..😥
Jo star kids hai..shayad wo sushant jaisa pen bhi nahi pakad sakte...faltu gupshup karne ke liye dimag kaha lagta hai..sushant jaisa speech dene ke liye knowledge aur self confidence hi chahiye..other so called superstars are very rude and egostic on stage and behave like they are king or badshah ..and insults non starkids ...on the other hand very much polite with not only stars but with there dogs also..
I still watching this videos. I love this man madly. Why we lost him. He is gold digger. God is is not fair at all. How interligent, how handsome he is.. We will miss you for forever
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTpOyqD4omw&amp;t=212">3:32</a> the girl who shout &quot;we love you anyway&quot; felt so hard ❤️
Here to listen him again , we don&#39;t have him now just his limited clips... 😓
his quick responses shows how smart he was
I think Sushant gets Fed up by doing same job now he has gone to space for research 😭😭
Mention  it&#39;s about 1 year by sushants death if  we want to give him tribute we have to decide that we should bycott Bollywood 🙏🙏<br> Salman khan<br>Aamir.khan<br>Shahrukh<br>Both ranveer<br>And all ladies
man like Sushant with his real attitude living in present  movement and excitement for best is the required thing for development <br>Sushant you will always in our hearts as a guiding light
If he wouldn&#39;t dropout he would be still withus😭😭😭

Who is watching after his death sushant (rapta that movie*****)
Justice for SSR
Always 💔
He was an intelligent individual.why did he kill himself ?doesn&#39;t make sense.he states he was an introvert yet he looks extremely confident and expressive.he states he was spoilt.spoilt means he felt he deserved more.he was a mediocre actor.he should have got over the obstacles in front of him
Nobody can be like ssr.  He was one an only...    Bro miss u everyday...

He could have done so so much! I have never hated anyone in my life more than I hate Bollywood! Sushant was a lovely guy! Such great vibes...great energy...damn I miss him
If only he&#39;d a clue - it&#39;s neither money nor fame nor popularity that mattered, it was something much more precious - and he had it - that needed blossoming, and he searched for his path but took a wrong turn, to descend into the Shavian hell, unaware he did so. <br><br>And he really belonged to Shavian heaven, which is what evidently impresses most of his fans, as amply clear from comments.
admi tho bahuth acha he par sunne keliye admi hi nahi he

He is basically talking about flow state. Miss you genius 😭😭😭😢
The unforgettable inspirational person for my life. 👍🙏
Missing him.... Sushant ❤️
My brother sushant 🌹🥀🌷😭🙏💋💔
I love u susanth bayya
This speech tells that he acted just for the kick of it, not for fame or money or anything else, and they say he committed suicide by getting into depression because some of his movies weren&#39;t a hit and some he lost to other actors, after watching this video anyone can say that for him acting in pavitra rishta and acting in MS Dhoni were no different, they gave him the same kick...now i am having some serious doubts about his suicide theory....
Sushant was the best is the best &amp; will be the best  ...... Most Intelligent ❤
SSR 🌟
After his gone I know him . I made a mistake . Let&#39;s  support Ssr like talents . Ssr is one of the rare movie stars
MAN LUCJY ARE THOSE WHO INTERACTED WITH HIM

Bollywood ke koi bhi heroine ka koi aukat nahi hai shushant singh rajput ke gf hone ke. Sushant singh rajput deserved much more than these shitty bollywood fucking queens.

Your Life compels people to rethink about the importance of having Dreams,  Humanity,  Innocence and Pureheartedness in Human Life......SSR You are indeed a Great Soul.....😊🙏
Sushant u are such a mastermind but a person with such a golden heart!! I just can&#39;t stop my pain thinking why u had to leave this world so soon! U&#39;ll remain in my heart forever darling Sushant! Luv u to the moon and back!❤❤😘❤❤
His 4 to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTpOyqD4omw&amp;t=330">5:30</a> time which he had and enjoying was taken away from the cunning people.
Good
I can see 661 SHIT EATING PEOPLE WHO LOVES DRUGGIST
He can&#39;t commit suicide🥺🥺🥺😕😕such a strong person 😕❤️💔
I never had the fortune to meet him when he was there with us, but would surely want to meet him in the afterlife if there&#39;s any such thing. We will always love you Sushant!
Can&#39;t stop seeing your photos, can&#39;t stop thinking about you.<br><br>Praying for justice to you.<br>May the culprits be named atleast, leave alone punishment
I love you sushant 🥀
Kabhi to saza hogi Aapke gunaahgaro ko 🙏🙏🙏
He was born with the mighty purpose of awakening us to the truth of Bollywood, and Mumbai as a whole. Government&#39;s such as this can exist in this day and age, is hard to believe. Now the correspondences I get, are all about the shock people are in at the aloofness, or maybe incompetence of those at the helm of running the country. If central government doesn&#39;t take the correct action - people don&#39;t want someone framed - for Sushant&#39;s murder. They want the real culprits behind bars. As for the actors in Bollywood. Their careers are done.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
RIP bro it look like some one has murdered me.....
Such an epitome of experiences
Hey sushant its for you wherever u r <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ssr">#ssr</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhizCcdJScw">https://youtu.be/BhizCcdJScw</a>
NOW plus Excitement. Well put. A person with such knowledge, wisdom and vision can never commit suicide. God bless his soul.
Can&#39;t believe such motivated actor can commit suicide. Something must have hurt him very deeply
Esa banda kabhi suicide kar hi nhi sakta 😒😒😒😒

Now i wonder that he shouldn&#39;t drop his college, and do what their parents said may be now he would be an IAS/IPS. Bollywood didn&#39;t deserve him. He was a precious gem.
Shusant Sir ap is duniya se chale  gaye ho pr sabki asli rup dikh gya kon kaisa haa. Miss you Shusant Sir

Justice for Sushant Singh Rajput.....<br>🙏🙏🙏👊👊👊👊👊👊🙏🙏🙏
Any sane person who is in senses can clearly see he is not a depressed kind of person. And this kind of positive person cannot take the suicide step!!! Hes an angel and a gem who was murdered!!<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsinghrajput">#JUSTICEFORSUSHANTSINGHRAJPUT</a>

🙏🙏
Brings Smile each time I watch his interviews and a deep halo followed by disbelief , you’re missed
In every possible way he was ahead of his time.  What a humble boy he was ! The Youngest kid of the family. The loveliest boy. Mother couldn&#39;t stay without his wonderful child. So SHE might take him away from us.

you are such a tremendous and pure soul, Sushant.. we and the world misses you dearly, shame on you insane, inhumane, illicit, coward, barbarous people of bollywood, mumbai police, maharashtra govt, shiva sena including roommates of Sushant for killing this beautiful soul, you won&#39;t even match to him even to the smallest part of sand in an ocean.. :(

I wish he had been given a platform in TED. Absolute brilliance, most importantly his intent towards the progress, the work, and the hard work he puts in the veil of &quot;excitement&quot; (in his words) and the truth he carries in his heart.. Thats set him apart.. he is an integral soul, the only soul who could have made huge utopian change in this current world. I wish he was let to live, he was let to contribute, he would have made wonders...I wish.

This person who talks so much sense. A person who is so knowledgeable , how can people say he had mental disorders. And the saddest part is people are believing this.
😭😭😭😭

Bollywood and it&#39;s lighters ( not stars anymore) they all collectively got scared of his charm &amp; excitement, they all planned &amp; succeeded to kill him,  and their silence is showing their jealousy &amp; low height compared to him now ..  Loved him from detective vyomkesh  bakhsi ( he was like Sherlock acting in vyomkesh bakshi)

Ab raja ka beta raja nahi banega, raja vahi banega Jo hakdar hoga🙏🙏
This is how it feels when a genius talks..... Baki bollywood ke chutiyap interviews to poori duniya dekh hi rahi hai and unko grow karne m help kar rahi h.
Riya killed Susant through overdosing drugs...
Any Hollywood&#39;s  acter not sports  kangan  she is fight alone with sushant  marder  case
Let Truth come out
Who are watching after his death
https://youtu.be/1ZXjMbec4aQ
Itna hot teacher ho toh padh chuki main ...lol 😇.... but on a serious note major inspiration. I hate maths but after listening to ssr in various videos...i hv started liking maths and developed  interest in quantum physics as well ..!! He was the perfect youth icon the world needed !! Come bck ssr !
The most humblest man on this planet
Really he was outstanding intelligent guy .... Sushant&#39; is the only person who made me cry after his death don&#39;t have any relation with him but still feels like I lost my very close person don&#39;t know why ....
Miss you
Excellent speech of SSR sir..<br><br>Thank you so much SSR .. miss you sir...
One line which he always says in maximum interviews that &quot; I live this moment.. I don&#39;t think much about future, I enjoy present&quot; seriously what a amazing person he was..
Ãryâñ kūmâr
Who else will boycott starkids
I love you suahant sir
Come back 😭😭😭 Shushant
Da man with such a clear vision n passion for life just can&#39;t commit suicide... Just can&#39;t believe he can suicide
In between Pin drop silence when he was giving such a wonderful speech... Shows da power of speech...
लोग चले जाते है पर कुछ यादें रह जाती है
Miss you
All of us are hurt as if a part of us take.....why do we feel like this?....tried to analyze it ...and this is what i think...<br>..Why do we like a song?.....because some part of our emotion is related to it....why majority of us cried or carry a tremendous pain in our hearts ?.....its because some part of us is mingled with his life....for a student  ...he is a  genius ...for a ambitious person its his perseverance.....for a poor person he proved that nothing is impossible....we see our self in his life....our struggle to achive inspite of handicapped circumstance...due to this....all of us see a part of ourself in him...that is way we feel that part of our self is taken away...his life is snapped before we could see his full potential  .....part of us is taken away because he was in our shoes and he showed us the way....that nothing is impossible...keep pushing your dreams and inevitably it will be accomplished. ...
When the screen goes off and the poster came to end i feel blanked ..
I love you sushant Singh Rajput 😭😭😭😭😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💕💕💓💓💓💕♥️💕♥️💕💕💞💕♥️💕♥️💕💞💕💕♥️

Articulate febulus Magnificent greatly tribute for SSR ji
Dear Sushant, <br>It has been quite a few weeks since they pushed you over the cliff of &#39;life&#39; towards the abyss. The good thing is you - being the &#39;Child of God&#39; - have safely navigated towards the Pearly&#39;s Gate and ensconced yourself comfortably in HIS lap. In retrospect, I believe that you were too rich and endowed to have polluted your soul and self, by dwelling on this earth amongst the lesser mortals any further. <br><br>I suppose you can see for yourself how deficient and short-sighted most of us are. Being lesser mortals, we are deficient intellectually and stunted morally. We had failed to nurture the treasures in you. We failed you - Sushant. The few conscious stricken here are now running helter-skelter to exhume the &#39;truth&#39; and fetch justice (in actual &#39;face-saver&#39;) for you. Well, this is all we the lesser mortals are capable of. <br> <br>Your sisters ( they had nurtured you well, Sushant) are giving their all to get back at the &#39;monsters&#39; - those demented and degenerate creatures in human form. Your father has shrugged off the rusts formed from old-age and is on a mission. I am sure they will all have much to share with you when they too take their leaps to the other world where you dwell. <br><br>To cut a long story short - WE THE PEOPLE FAILED YOU. That is because we are basically hypocrites who deify murderers as &#39;dabangs&#39; , eulogize child molesters as intellectuals who sculpt the &#39;saaransh&#39; of life and those chicken hearts as &#39;singhams&#39;. We chew delight from &#39;sanitary napkins&#39; and end up idolizing illiterate restaurant attendants as super-humans. I am a hypocrite too - I have contributed towards ensuring that these germs thrive on by paying to watch them procreate. I can only say - SORRY!
This LEGEND once said &quot;Bollywood would collapse if they wont let the real talents come in&quot;, are here you go RIP BOLLYWOOD...Its an end now
Nice
Wow
Jisne dislike kiya WO harami  Pakistani hoga
&quot;after winning a rat race you are still rat&quot;,he is a person above success,a person down to earth
I am the biggest fan of SSR ❤️😭

सुशांत सपने देखता गया और उन्हें पूरा करता गया।
जाते जाते हमको जो सीखा के गए हो,वो हम कभी नहीं भूलेंगे।<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottallbollywood">#BoycottAllBollywood</a>
he is a bit nervous but natural.<br>I LOVE HIM
Yaar aisa banda kabhi suicide nhi kar sakta hai🙏🙏🙏
i need some things from government:👉👉👉👉<br>1) a star in the sky named after him.<br>2) he be given the title &quot;STAR OF INDIA&quot; or &quot;BHARAT KA TAARA&quot;<br>3) he be given highest level award like Bharat Ratna,or Padma Bhushan<br>4) any indian state be named after Him.<br>AGREE?
LOTS OF LOVE SHUSHANT
I never believe you are die sushi 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 whole life your fan&#39;s Sushant sir please come back 🤲🤲😭
I miss you ssr😭😭
Where is he now? Miss him 😢 so much
miss u  sir
So unfortunate  . Full of life  no words to express
In all his interviews I feel he used to undersell himself, very humble, introvert and didn’t disclose much about himself I.e. this was a perfect platform to tell this educated audience about his love for cosmology, quantum physics, won physics Olympiad, his love for amazing books , etc etc I feel somehow somewhere that didn’t let people know him as much before then we know of him now!
SSR multi talented super star our sushant Sir.. Sushant Sir is one and one in whole world 😍😘😘😘😣
What an inspirational speaker- intelligent and witty🙌🏻👌👌🔥🔥
I wish  he had never met Rhea Chakraborty 😭😭😭
Illiterate chamcha journalists, selfish hypocrites of Bollywood &amp;  corrupt illiterate politicians who r saying Sushant was never so big star or famous they should watch this video.<br><br>I bet  Bollywood’s any so called big stars wouldn’t have lasted more then 5 mints. And in those 5 mints they only would’ve spoken abt their stupid films. 😂 ..But I think no one will call Bollywood  uneducated hypocrites on this type of of intellectual platform 😂😂.<br><br><br>Actually all these hypocrites of Bollywood were so insecure from Sushant that’s y they asked their paid PR to write fake articles abt Sushant &amp; they themselves insulted him on every  possible platforms. <br><br>But look now even  culprits murdered so him  so brutally this innocent honest soul managed to   Creat so much awesomeness  in public abt fake Bollywood’s hypocrites &amp; Mumbai’s system.
Come back ssr
Guys let&#39;s start &quot;JANTA MAFIA&quot;<br> it&#39;s an era by youngster and janta , boycott Bollywood by product ie, movies, brand they sponsor, company,product etc,,<br>Let make Bollywood beg for support from us...make them realise who they really are...i# swach Bollywood abhiyaan<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23janta">#janta</a> mafia vs Bollywood mafia...and Alia Bhatt is Muslim...# Sagar bhalla bhai<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23janta">#janta</a> mafia

Guys 1 request pls dont forget after some years like in salman khan &amp;sanjay dutt case now,or else after some years they would together kill again some innocent new life.Remember guys bollywood,ISI,D gang,criminals,politicians and even police all are one.<br><br>Want NIA(National Investigating Agency) for entire bollywood, their crimes, ISI links, etc<br> 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏<br><br>Its the best thing occured in covid, saare Murderers, Rapists, Criminals k glamorous chehre se mukhota utth raha he. BollyDawood industry ka GLAMOUR se jyada DAMBAR dikh raha he. Inka STARDOM se TARDOM dikhne laga he. Its really a good thing that no one would ever like to call these antinational, biased towards criminals, and intellectual terrorist, as A listers or role models, ANYMORE.

The awesome Sushant with most humble talented person in the world
Tal-Ben Shahar  said the same thing in his book. Engage in actions that gives you present happiness and future benefits. Not rat-race,  not being totally spiritual.
How can anyone do injustice to him!!!!
IIT Bombay + SSR = Heaven .

Life of everybody is precious. But here we had Sushant, whose synonym could be nothing other than &quot;Born to WIN&quot;. We would ensure that no other bright mind, enters this muddy Bollywood. Boycott Bollywood.
Awesome 👍

Those who have taken him away from the field of Arts, the gift he could have given with his talent, over and all, such young life with child like smile....those who took it away has to lament eternally for what they took it away from us, from his family, from the world of cinema and from our planet. Their sin won&#39;t be forgiven.

Truth - <br>Like Jia Khan was murdered to make space for aliya Bhatt.<br>Shushant was killed to make space for Ranveer Kapoor.....<br><br>Rhea played role of Sooraj Pancholi in Shushant&#39;s case.<br>Both directed by Mahesh Bhatt.<br><br>Mastermind - still hiding ..
He is great
Our jaan
Is the video edited @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTpOyqD4omw&amp;t=1760">29:20</a>? Or is it just me who thinks this? <br><br>Also, was moved to the core when he replied &#39;an unsuccessful engineer&#39; and then asked, &quot;Aapko answer acha nahin laga?&quot; How can someone be this decent? Wow! ❤ No other star could ever have done this! Then shaking hands with the winners. He was shinier and more valuable than all diamonds this earth could have. ❤
Very intelligent and unique personality 1ever seen.May his soul rest in peace.

Iam just half way through the video and I couldn&#39;t help but be impressed by his thought process..<br><br>Rarely does one we see someone this good looking. intelligent and humble  too<br><br>It also makes you think.. His speech is so well written and connected that that &#39;I am thankful for bebu in my life.. Iam thankful for lilu in my life bullshit &#39; seems so fake.. You don&#39;t even have to study the handwriting to see its fake <br><br>WE all should learn how to follow our dreams from sushant.. And we all now connect with him as someone of our own<br><br>Banda apna ban gaya hai... Ab ⚡💐💫
Speechless
Lot of things to learn from the entire video.
we miss you SSR !

It is very difficult to forget u Sushant💔
18 min... Wow
What a funny interview<br>I enjoyed it <br>Love you sushant <br>U r my inspiration
Sushant seems like a highly gifted and talented person, his IQ must&#39;ve been high. The gifted people are vulnerable in the outside world. Sushant is not cut out for Bollywood. Bollywood are for street smarts with less education and low IQ, he chose the wrong field, he should have chosen technical field, he could been a entrepreneur with his intelligence. Its sad that India gives so much importance to Cinema field and that&#39;s why people get influenced. I feel sad for him, he is such a gifted and talented person. It&#39;s sad that India doesn&#39;t have any program like other countries for High IQ kids.
You fought for truth Sushant....You were a youth icon n  will always be......You will remain in heart always 😭😭
Anyone came here after Pewds’ vid? Or it’s just me.
Love you Sushant
It is very difficult to accept he is no more
Why?Why?GOD...you loved him so much that you called him so early.....that also this way...🙏 it&#39;s now your time God to answer our prayer to give this pure heart JUSTICE.
India lost a real hero, intelligent actor. Ap jaisa talent dobara janam nhi lega India me. We all miss you. We love you. You always stay in my heart as a real star.
Riya ne kaise fassa liya yaar ... shushant kash aap jaan paate that how much we al lov u n miss u more now .
such a deep sentences he has.......................

You can relate to his experiences in life. We&#39;ve all had experienced parents pushing us to seek education so we can make something of our life. We all had same dreams to make it big so we could finally buy the car or house etc. He put himself out there....took the risk.  He was so brave to risk his college degree in order to chase his dream. Not many of us could do that. We let go of our dreams and settle for the security. He believed in himself and was willing to take that chance. I admire that so much in him.
I&#39;m sad didn&#39;t knew much abt him before he died... Myself being an engineer respect him ... Way too intelligent to be in Bollywood... I wish u had chosen some other profession wud have definitely got derseving fame even then.. love u sweetheart 😘

The Best Person i ever semen and knows from Bollywood. His so very inspiration, a person like this never decided suicide for died. His clearly died by Murder. Many good pray and love for u from Indonesia 🇲🇨🇲🇨♥️♥️🇮🇳🇮🇳
He was an true asset and gem of India
Love him🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️. Will always remain your fan😘😘
He was an extraordinary man in an ordinary world. If you have read his 50 dreams, those were not some random dreams, those were well calculated, thoughtful and deeply studied dreams. They not only killed him, but killed his dreams too. I mean what this person could have achieved in the next 15-20 years is beyond imagination.
Bollywood died for me with Sushant(My Forever Hero, My Inspiration) on 14-06-20 <br>14+6=20
Such a true soul and a enthusiastic person,he was....you are being missed every second Sushant Sir...😓

Οne of my favorite interview from him😘 Iam so sorry to dont understand the  hindi language and some other cant understand them .But this speech was so motivate so charismatic I believe that there was no better representative than him to show what the will means, dreams and maturity of a person means. World not only India lost someone great
It&#39;s been 60 Days since The Handsome Hunk Emerging Superstar Shushant Singh Rajput was murdered by REHA CHAKRAWORTY,  SIDHARTH PITHANI, Sandeep Singh, Mahesh Bhatt,  I&#39;m really SAD whenever I see his pic or video i found myself very SAD. We have lost such a innocent &amp; Talented actor .....he was brilliant in terms of everything. <br><br>Let&#39;s support for justice with Shushant Singh Rajput. <br>.
We want justice for our legend Superstar sushant sir 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Soo inspiring, such a talented...i am missing him 😔😢..he always being in our heart🙏🙏
Wow...this was an excellent speech...<br>He learnt meditation...To be in Present.
Wow...he is giving a speech and dropouts..he is??<br><br>Oh God...all dropouts are well talented and die early like Steve job from Apple/ warren buffet etc.
This person never ever do a sucide...
We lost a legend
You&#39;ll always be my inspiration.
Such a great intallegent personality we never forget you Sushant 😘 love you sooo much
He is brilliant 🥰😘
Sushant&#39;s qualities - good human being, intelligent, handsome , healthy , hardworking , can write by both the hands, very good dancer , actor,  person hving deep interest in astonomy , plantes ,successful man. Most of us did not get work or success till at d age of 30 or 35. He has achieved fame starting from Television at 20-21 I guess.
question asked by students were ok but greatly answered by SSR which was the best to see this interview of SSR.
What a great intelligent brilliant multi talented actor ❤️❤️ cute guy love you SSR n miss you
Sushant was bullied,banned, vilified and abused by aditya chopra. All his movies were given to ranveer singh. Big production houses refused to work with him because of aditya chopra. His character was defamed by paid agents aka journos. But still he survived and thrived. Sushant representated the real India. The underdog with No sugarmommy, no godfathers, no influencial gf&#39;s, zero affiliation with bjp heavy weights, or relatives to give him leg up in the movie industry. He shattered stereotype and excelled in every thing he set his mind into from engineering, background dancer, top grossing tv actor to giving back to back hits in bollywood. Above all he was good human being and honest hard worker. May Allah take him to paradise.
Everyone says that Sushant was a legend, but he was more than that. There is no word that could describe it.
So lovely person sorry to lose this good man <br>From Iran
Miss you man
Feel like to cry when see him 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏sorry SSR we did not support ur movies somuch when u ws deserving hero...we all ws behind glittering but now we understand every glittering is not gold but u ws real gold gem of industry🙏🙏🙏🙏
Man of success
To all the viewers of this video - &quot;Please stop watching bollywood movies, the industry is run my mafias who all killed this GEM and this would be the biggest tribute to SSR.&quot;
Best questions so far and answer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTpOyqD4omw&amp;t=1800">30:00</a>
It&#39;s hurting 🥺🥺
I watch him, enjoy his talk and in the end  I remember he is no more which makes me sad. I wish someone  consoles me &amp; says his murder will be avenged  , sushant will not return though. Saddening
🥺🥺🥺
We lost a💎 gem
Sorry to say but that was really a very CHINDI bouquet💐😬 to present to such a wonderful star🌟<br>He&#39;s such a sweetheart ❤️
Isss seminar me jo students hai mostly wo pro wale sabke baap type nahi hai.....ye sab MBA wale hai.....IIT bombay ki shaan lab me coding kar rahi hai
One and only star my sush ❤💔🥺😭
Pl eliminate bollywood
Genius Sushant.....youth icon
We lost a 💎.. Boycott Bollywood nepotism
I can&#39;t believe this guy could not get a decent girl...
He was very wise, very intelligent, not only about science and all <br>But overall he understood the overall life process very strongly<br>He planned everything of his life, writing things then executing plans<br>And regularly achieved targets<br>Such a person can never commit suicide. Many reasons r there 4 this but 1 which is linked to his writing habits is that a person who makes and plans everything about his future  in writing , he also wrote about what all he is grateful for<br>Then why such a person will not write a single very much important suicide note<br>It was a murder!! <br>Please believe this
This thing can&#39;t be proved in court but in general people know that people who have such a deep knowledge of science and tech and r   such highly wise as sushant was, such people view life in a completely different perspective and they keep on fighting and hence can never commit suicide<br>He was 100% murdered!! <br>Plz believe this since this is the truth
Multi talented Actor..❤❤
His words are not common and repetitive his vocabulary is outstanding no Bollywood person can touch his level of I.Q
WE MISS YOU.
Love u Sushant love u Yar love u alotttt man  love u no more words Ntg is left here just love u am missing u a lot am feeling that my personal loss ur man loveeeee u
He never said to any 1 ...No<br>Greedy people around him took benefit of this quality of SSR😭
