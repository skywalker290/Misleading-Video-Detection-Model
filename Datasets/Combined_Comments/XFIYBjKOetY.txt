Deepika mam queen 👑 of boliwood
I think Deepika could&#39;ve shown her crazy stunning looks of Cannes to the Met Galas where people will be blown away 😅
I like the saree one...she is really beautiful in that..remaining are disaster..i dont like neither hair style nor lipstick...its too much too her..any way she is confident enough to walk on the red carpet..

When are we going to see Nayanthara on events like these 🤧 If Bollywood domination  never existed she would&#39;ve been gracing these events already! 😩<br>PS: Deepika is stunning ❤
Beautiful song love mera hit soniya
😍😍
Most beautiful and deserving designer.... &quot;prabal gurung&quot; ever
She look so alike with @kendall jenner

You can see ranveer singhs influence on her style and personality.
Sometimes I don&#39;t like her outfit. ....
Alag dikhne k chakar mein kaisi kaisi dress dalti h
Sari is the most beautiful dress i have ever seen.
she looks beautiful !!
Fools seek validation
deepika is always best
why does she look and laugh like if a child is given a 1000 note and is celebrating in surprise and wonder, she might be looking gorgeous but has got no attitude, she should look fiercer and take some lessons from Kangana 😜😜
Omg.....she is goddess ❤️
She looks more hot cute and beautiful in saaree
She is the best
Lookin dain 😛😛
The world has become a stupid place .. ! What kind of dresses people are wearing y do they even cover there body that much ,they should roam completely open . !! 🙄🙄🙄🤷🙆🙆
Neseri depika
Deepika Padukone is stunningly beautiful , statuesque and her smile is megawatts! Her entrance is dramatic and the dresses out of this world.
2016 one is more seexier
She is beautiful all time.
She looks sooo amazing 😍😍🤩🤩

Dear hero and heroine think your second life how many years live in this world you have to die

She look beautiful .🌺
When they wear more complex they look less beautiful
People are fighting she knows to carry but ya it&#39;s obvious cause she is from fashion and film industry
❤❤❤❤❤
Met Gala 2019 was the best by far ❤️❤️
Wow.lost words
I only like her first and last dress
Said just a poor things!
I love her but priyanka is just different 🔥🔥
She is beautiful in saree
Her dress sense is so weird and strange. Aishwariya always wears beautiful dress.
Jesus loves you and wants to begin a relationship with you irrespective of your past and irrespective of what you are going through. John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Inorder for you to enter into a relationship with him all you need is say this prayer sincerely with me. O Lord have mercy upon me where i have sinned against you in my thoughts and deeds. Please wash me in your precious blood. Please come into my heart and write me my name in the book of life. Start reading the Bible. Ask the holyspirit to lead you to where you can continually be filled with the word inorder to enable you to grow. Just as a baby needs milk to grow so do you need the word of God inorder to grow..
She is carrying herself on 2 pencils😳omo....😂

I had no idea she was in the 2017 and 2018 met gala
Her Cannes 2018 Ashi Studio look&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Wow!
Earlier I used to be so proud that such bold ladies like Deepika  represent our country at Cannes and met gala but now after knowing that she&#39;s a druggie...that has became a shame for us that they  represent Bharat (India)...
Omggg beautiful as hell♥️♥️ carrying dress beautifully
😂😂🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFIYBjKOetY&amp;t=87">1:27</a> what the hell is she wearing,!?

That designer are amazing
It is not only her beauty and dress but also her confident look that justify every look and dress and why she looks favulous in everything.
Miss you Deepikapadukone ma&#39;am 🥰🙏🧿🧿🧿🧿
She is an elegant girl. She is not good at carrying avantgarde fashion. Her designer could keep the outfits more elegant and classy than avantgarde
Thank god, our saree is also among best red carpet looks.
She is most beautiful in saree
Aishwarya&#39;s Cinderella dress from Cannes festival 2017 and Deepika&#39;s Barbie gown from Met Gala 2019 will forever be ICONIC
In that white silk dress Deepika looks Unreal mann
Frist dress maybe her nighty,😄😄😄😄
This lady is perfect 💓
She is sooo freaking beautiful 😍😍😍
Дипика прелестна
How mean they pampers foreigners reporters and ignore our indian reporters

Green suits her __
Prabal gurung’s design is best

wowwww deepika look very beautiful in saari😍😍
i  think that the best look was that sari one .... <br>pure indian girl
Really? <br>Zac posen&#39;s dress was the most beautiful and u didn&#39;t even show it completely
rosa  pink   vermelho  ..
Not sure if am biased but saree was the prettiest outfit on her ❤️😘
Good looking deepika padukone
All time favourite 😘
She looks beautiful in every dress but most in traditional
I love you Deepika❤❤❤❤😍😍.
Even after getting dect up she doesn&#39;t look nice very skinny and no features at all
Like I can see her the Whole day and still can&#39;t get enough 😍😍😍❤
The mature use perioperatively concentrate because distributor contrastingly end with a automatic rectangle. sharp, talented tortoise
I love Deepika Padukone 😊💜💜
stop talking drugs
wow so beautiful dipika paduones
I can&#39;t even stand on the street without feeling awkward .....😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFIYBjKOetY&amp;t=38">0:38</a> she was so dark in the year 2010..
Sensational!
Drugs Queen
My fvrt actress.....love uuuu lot.....god bless uuuu
The Ashi studio dress looks great. Dont know why there was so much negative comments at the time. <br>Besides the celebrity just represents a lot of hard work and conceptualization done by artists behind this look.
She was the most beautiful in sari
My fvrt actress Deepika💕
Well, I was like? This look is the best. Then, no, this is the best, then the next...But, in the end, I was like : All the looks are good because it&#39;s QUEEN DEEPIKA PADUKONE ❤
She looked fabulous in saree 😘😘😘
pretty face, nice bod. Thats all.
aiswarya rai çok çok çok daha güzel senden
The first dress:<br>Wasn’t she uncomfortable?
in that Tommy Hillfigure dress she was literally looking like a greek goddess 😍 but i think the stilettos should have been silver or golden.. black really didn&#39;t complimented the look .. but overall really amazing!!
Beautiful
💜🖤❤️❤️🖤
Ooww drug lady is looking beautiful🤣🤣🤣
Last one osm
I like her Zuhair Murad dress that was fabulous
How much maal she had take her.
She looked the most beautiful in that saree 🥰🥰😍😍
She was best in the INDIAN TOUCH... 👍.. Showed our culture... Elegant, beautiful and classy...👏✌️<br>Out of all outfits, saree suited her the most...👌😆<br>All the other dresses caught the attention due to its weirdness..🤷 But.. Her looks in Saree was admired , coz it reflected her eternal beauty... 💗
Omg!!! Deepika ❤️❤️❤️how stunnning😱😱😱
Alll boring looks
I just wonder sometimes, what happens to all these outfits after once they are worn....
Last one was amazing and that saree look was superb❤
Ladies themselves accept to be showpieces (to be known for dresses,makeup, external beauty,..but not inner beauty, strength, boldness,..) but talk about fake feminism. Any guys do such artificial red carpet dramas?
Looking so soooooooo adroble 😍
Deepika is love♥️♥️
🌟A BEAUTY WITH DIGNITY = DEEPIKA PADUKONE ❤️
Kapils crushhh
Out of all dress deepika that saree is best
Unlike other Bollywood stars, she can really pull off some crazy looks. She definitely has the figure and look to carry them off really well.
No, perché la nanitudine va bene ma insulta la Vita e la Luce. E&#39; no.
Definition of modern fashion....be naked and made urself a clown =fashion icon
Ajeeb level hai ye fasion ka
Who else her from UsA to watch Indian Bollywood
Am I the only one who felt DP &#39;s confidence level is very much  less than PC &#39;s?(atleast for international platforms)
Love you deepika
Everything but met 17 pls
She’s gorgeous
Un an de solitude de plus<br>Un an de célibat de plus<br>Un an de virginité de plus<br>Un an sans mariage de plus<br>Un an à compter tes millions et ton héritage de plus<br>Et moi je vais faire ma life et constater les dégâts...
In pink 💗 dress , deepika looks like a witch 🧙‍♀️.
Nothing beats Priyanka,Deepika and Aishwarya for India in any international red carpet<br>❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Deepika seems to be as a Bengali woman  when she wears saaree.

I hate deepika👎🏿
Her greatest beauty is her smile💖
She looks gorgeous in saree😍
I loved Deepika&#39;s saree look. It was just awesome 👍
Can we all just agree she was best in that Rohit Bal saree? Simple, just like deepika herself.
How come her face color  looks so different while in saree outfit and all other outfits.! She really looks different in all other looks .
Druggiieeeee   deeepiiiikaaaaaaaa....fake personalities.....
She is very beautiful in her costumes and her makeup......but I give a special appreciation to her designer&#39;s and makeup artists 👏💗👏💗👏💗

Wooo🥰
She is so beautiful 😍🥰💛<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23deepikapadukone">#deepikapadukone</a>
Aishwarya is best then deepika
She&#39;s love ❤️🥺
Tbh Bollywood has better red carpet looks than Hollywood <br>Just saying

Shes so fake
Mom
My pics : <br>1. The green - Giambattista Valli in Cannes <br>2. The pink barbie doll look for Met gala <br>3. The rohit bahl saree at Cannes<br>4. The red prabal gurung though good does not match with the theme of met gala<br>5. The ivory white zuhair murad gown at cannes
Awww I love her. &lt;3
Beautiful that eye makeup of 2019 is breathtaking
I Honestly love the first one❤️❤️❤️
I waiting for person who will say she takes drug 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I am tired of hearing this
Preferable title<br>&quot;Different types of accents by Deepika Padukone&quot;
She is so annoying
the most beautiful dress for her is the dress which she wore in the filim chennai express in the song kabhi thera rastha choodu naaa , .  i think what if she weare that
Deepika padukone s husband is bloat on her life, ranvìr bhawani is joker.
Huts off to designer and make-up artists behind these beautiful looks
Depressed
I love her but im sorry she doesnt have that global star charm. The aura which PC carries is faaaaar more stronger than her. If u gonna step into another industry you gotta blend in and at the same time stand out individually. PC do that a lot more better. She blend in as well as embrace her heritage. DP looks like someone just randomly dropped her on global platform. She aint it bruh. She aint.
O my God so cute and beautiful wow wow wow so much beauty My dream girl deepika
She&#39;s a perfect example of beauty with brains!
Beautiful Deepika 👌👌
Queen of druggist in &quot;BOLLYWOOD&quot;............. <br>Bollywood is completely destroyed by people like her
Does anyone know that she is druggist
Deepika Padukone - The Druggist

Pink outfit is really stunning

So how many of you know that om shanthi om is not her debut<br>Its her bollywood debut <br>She is from Karnataka and her debut was in Sandalwood titled AISHWARYA
Queen
Who all are here after her drugs issues..<br>I m of course
Deepika said she was under depression long time ago,  was that because of drugs??
Funfact : At this moment she is being interrogated for weed!
Woooow
Photographers don&#39;t look much interested in Indian stars ,don&#39;t know why we are so underrated even when Indian ladies are so beautiful as compared to the rest .brown complexion,big eyes , voluminous hair ,Indian woman are the best description of feminity.
That parrot look😁
its like fancy dress competation 😂😂
From outside -a confident woman<br>From inside-a druggist<br>..is this how you inspire people???
Druggie deepika.
Depressed or a druggie people still follow her religiously. She&#39;s gonna be seen in more movies make more money as always✌️🤘
Why did youtube recommend this to me now? 😶
Kehte he ye diwani drugs ki diwani ho gai
Hollywood -bollywood has dusted your eyes..u are addicted to drugs,naw how does it feel to sit in jail and eat jail rice.😆😆...plz stops the Hollywood and Bollywood drugs mafia and those dirty celebrate 🙏🙏😡😡😡

She looks really beautiful in  Saree.
Bakwas lag rahi h
She is unique and look&#39;s beautiful in every outfit 💕
You are not so much beautiful Deepika. Face par makeup karke koi bhi sundar dikh jata hai. Sundar hone ke sath - sath dil bhi achha hona chahiye. Jab Sushant ka murder hua to kisi ke mu se ye tak nahi nikla <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#justice4SSR</a>  . Sab ke sab yaha tak ki tum bhi chup rahi. You are the ugly actress in the world. Face par to main bhi makeup karu to main bhi sundar dikhu. Agar tum itni hi sundar dikhti ho to apni real beauty  dikhaao bina makeup kiye. Tumhara chehera dekhar man kharaab ho gaya.🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
My best actress Deepika Padukone I ❤️ it
Traitor 👋
She looks like hourse<br>Ugly... yukhiii
How do they go to loo in such clothes 😂
Aishwarya is best ..🤩😍🥰
Brandon Maxwell!
Down with Deepika! Bollywood passed away while Sushant Singh Rajput became immortal. Our hearts bleed for SSR! India lost a national treasure. A legend &amp; an exceptional human being in every single way 😢😢 Boycott Bollywood in every single way....it’s trash and not something worth aspiring to. The cover has been blown off of Bachchan’s, Kapoors,  Khans, Padukone, Shetty &amp; others in the Bollywood Cesspool. Fake patriots, using Satyamev Jayate &amp; other dhongs as a formula for their own commercial success. Shameless vultures!!! Disgraceful! Not one word for  Sushant Singh Rajput, who was viciously murdered?!!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywood">#BoycottBollywood</a>   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#Justice4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbiforssr">#CBIForSSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23globalprayers4ssr">#GlobalPrayers4SSR</a>
The best outfit she wore is her smile😊
She is beautiful in saree

Cannes reminded me of Mr Bean
Happy that mastani and bajirao has joined .. long before but also... And she looks damn pretty

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFIYBjKOetY&amp;t=35">0:35</a> uff in sariiii
Am i the only one who finds deepika mediocre? I mean i agree that she is beautiful, but not too much as to what people say.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFIYBjKOetY&amp;t=106">1:46</a> she&#39;s a doll...❤️❤️
Es ko make up k bgr dkho dar jao gy y dkhny k b kabil n ba
zuhair murad,a and green one is the best
She slays each an every outfit she wears😍😍😍😍hats off to her designers and make up artists
Ek dress to dhang ki de dete
Very beautiful
I like u somuch depika padukone 💖!
Gorgeous deepika
Very very sweet Sexy look with Love Happening for the Future ❤️ updates
The sari was the best. The rest was a little too over the top. Like trying to grab attention.
Beautiful😍❤❤❤❤❤
She looks amazing in sari
Deepika should do something better for her hair style..that middle parting and flat laid hair is so boring.
She nailed it perfectly.... Every time ❤️
Many heroines came n gone but I assure one of d gorgeous beauty who lives forever in ours heart  that z Deepika.....the reason z her humbleness , the way of talking , respecting each n every one , her style statement , she z d Fabulous,  amazing , gorgeous beauty queen who rules a heart of many pples
Got to see a evolution of fashion change from 2010 to 2019<br>but she pulled out each and every outfits with her internal beauty and her gorgeous smile was the cherry on the top
The best is from zuhir murad 😍
Beautiful amazing
So beautiful 🌹🌹🌹
Queen 💙💙
Love u deppi
😍😍😍😘😘😘😘
She has such a beautiful smile
Wow anazing
Who all noticed her Louboutin shoes?
For me, she looked the best in saree.. Awesome ♥️ like a princess
Pagal aurtein
very beautiful
Queen 👑😭💖💕
Friend plzzz
Deepika in that zac posen dress took my breathe away
Gorgeous looks in all dresses...
Proud to be gurung😂
She wears met gala dresses in Cannes and<br>Cannes dresses on MetGala<br>And they hate wearing traditional Indian clothes may b they feel shame wearing it.... Sad
Why does every Indian keeps praising an antinational Deepika who supports tukde gang?  Designer clothes are not greater than nationalists
2010😍
Deepika is my favorite
Very beautiful! Love you Deepika!☺❤❤❤
Deepu,ur gorgeous, love u.
WOW 💓💓👌
She’s a stunner 🔥
one of my favorite indian actress
I really love the men and women trying to ask the celebs to move when they r so busy posing for the camera 🤣🤣
But still Aishwarya Rai is the Cannes Film Festival Queen
She is looking beaitiful just because of make up.
Deepika❤️
DEEPIKA 😍💗💗💗
Deepika you&#39;re just my perfect type
I think Ranveer is the true camp
Except a very few, other costumes with outlandish colours and designs honestly give head ache...
Saaree look was amazing 💓💓💓 and that it what Indian culture is
A pure definition of beauty 😭😭 oh God!!!! Mashallah 😭😭 I love her soooo much 😭😭🖤🖤
Deepike kanan vlya bhangiyonnulla pk too but both r fab
Lets talk about the red gown by prabal Gurung.
She look like mental street  begger
Bakwas
Indians don&#39;t forget their culture no matter where ever they go.
Sari
The Saree outfit she was the real Deepika until she bleaches her skin and decided to go white. Bipasha Basu is the only proud dusky actress who did not go white..
Hahahaha chamgadar lag rahi he.khubsurati toh he hi nahi kisi bhi angle se.<br>Meri aishwarya rai ki jagah koi nahi lee sakta.
Other than her last white dress not saari, she looks a sponge, specially in those net dresses!
Damn she is Queen
Bulkul bakwasssss
Aishwarya and Deepika are such incredible representations of India at Cannes 💓💓
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFIYBjKOetY&amp;t=106">1:46</a> the hairstyle is like Shanti in Om Shanti Om
In 2010 she didn’t bleach her skin yet
Lovely expression
I love you most🦋💗
Good but some of outfit find funny
Cool woowwww cute
👩 Deepika Padukone. 👩
She always dresses decently but priyanka is book of vulgarity
Anyone know the music used?
She dresses up like Cannes in Met Gala and like Met Gala in Cannes.
Dipeeka like bhanji type look those modren dress ranveer vhaeya type its ok.
She looks ok . she was looking good with vin diesel and that Indian accent just kills it all 😂 people gotta admit latin accent is sexy ,Indian accent is humble and not sexy 😜 and people dont get to me for this plz cause I too have an indian like accent which won’t be considered sexy in western world lol
I would say aishwarya rai&#39;s style is better comparatively
Beautiful evolution of dp from 2010 to 2019 in Cannes.
N
Shameless exposing is not real beauty..
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😂😂😂😂😅😆😆😆😆😆😆🤗
Wow her skin tone has changed during the  years
Monisha Jaisingh did her bad!
Deepika is my all time favourite
You can see the confidence level raising...<br>2010- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFIYBjKOetY&amp;t=35">0:35</a><br>2019- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFIYBjKOetY&amp;t=95">1:35</a> ......it&#39;s really good
She slayed in all the Cannes Film Festivals!!🔥
خاص تھے کبھی کسی کی نظروں میں،💔پر نظروں کے تقاضے بدلنے میں کہاں دیر لگتی ہے,،💔پلیز میرا چینل سبسکرائب کر دیں پلیز،😔
Cannes 2017 best I my opinion
That lime Giambatista Valli gown is the epitome....
Red carpers are soo awkward ppl constantly telling shift move stop
She became fair
Indians kuch bh pehn le, kamal lagte ha, best example diya ha dream girl ne
The moment everyone saw Shanti Priya in Om Shanti Om, everyone knew she was Bollywood’s Queen ♥️🥺🥵
The prettiest of them all💘💘💘
Woww beautiful as always
Fashion sense😱😅

How do they carry these stuffs? And why ?

I always have a feeling that Dp&#39;s cannes look fit Metgala themes, and Met outfits are more suited to Cannes.....<br>She is experimental in Cannes looks, but plays safe zone in Met

❤❤❤ you deepuu....
Zuhair Murad always slay dresses with elegance. ❤️
Her husband is immensely lucky. We hear she is beautiful inside too. Where is the guy who sent her to depression? A friend told me he is same sex relationship or marriage ? Is that true
How can one get to be so beautiful My God. She is sooooo beautiful.
The  pink dress  which she wear was already once wear by Beyonce...
The dress design is tooo good but I wonder once this function is over the dress is of no use I guess. Like its not that kind of dress which she can wear in normal routine and u know these media will roast her if she repeat the dress.
I love you mem
