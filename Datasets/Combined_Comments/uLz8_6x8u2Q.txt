Shilpa shetty ...natural beauty real beauty
Anushka looked good why did she do plastic surgery
I&#39;ve seen some Bollywood actress would spemd lootta tym in skin cosmetics and skin treatment just stay young or blah bt does not workout or exercise which makes u look more Young and fit. They are lazy to follow natural and easy steps than idly spending money on unnecessary products n spoil themselves . Lol
Why always their lips. Xd
Agar Paisa h to kuch bhi Kara lo
Plastic surgery buri nhi hai jisko jarurt hai usko krvani cahiye pr kuch actresses or jyada beautiful dikhne ke chkar me apna face kharab krti hai .....to unhe esa nhi krna cahiye ....ab mouni ka example le to unki surgery bhut achi huyi hai .jisse bo or jyada beautiful or popular bhi ho gyi .,...pr jinka face pehle se perfect hai unhe ye sab nhi krna cahiye
Natural beauty is perfect
Nhi karani chahiye
Fake beauty real appreciate 🙂
Humare na kahne se kya koi manega ..
Nose ki surgery karwana jruri hai..
Make up isn&#39;t beauty..u guys fool people around by artificial appearance..do not entertain our generation calling it beauty..
It&#39;s good for them who feel comfortable and impowerd after sugery  we shouldn&#39;t criticise
No
Rekha and shilpa shetty is missing in list

Dear God🙏💜💜💗💞 in heaven, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I acknowledge to You that I am a sinner, and I am sorry for my sins and the life that I have lived; I need your forgiveness.<br>I believe that your only begotten Son Jesus Christ shed His precious blood on the cross at Calvary and died for my sins, and I am now willing to turn from my sin.<br>You said in the bible that if we confess the Lord our God and believe in our hearts that God raised Jesus from the dead, we shall be saved.<br>Right now I confess Jesus as my Lord. With my heart, I believe that God raised Jesus from the dead. This very moment I accept Jesus Christ as my own personal Savior and according to His Word, right now I am saved. Amen.
The Gospel of salvation of our souls: 💜💕💜💖💞💗💞💗💞❤❤💗❤💗❤💜💕For what I received I passed on to you as of [first importance]: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve.  After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time,

No
Nhi
May be everyone is beautiful❤
We desi people always put the whole towel inside our nose 👃 to clean it up. No wonder why our nose keeps getting bigger and broader. Always use the pressing motion when cleaning nose; never insert finger or things cuz it will stretch your nose from inside. 😃
&quot;...apni jaal mein phasa diya hai.&quot; LMAO. It&#39;s plastic surgery; a product/service not some mouse-trap. haha.
If anyone is real beautiful, so no need plastic surgery
I hate people who change themselves just because someone else call them &quot;ugly&quot;. Didn&#39;t Priyanka said &quot;be yourself&#39;&#39;, wtf happened now?
Bilkul nahi 😎
Rekha ki khoobsurti ka kya raj h???

Age ki hisaab se body mai badlao aate hai aapko ye accept karna hi padega. Aap uppari body change karoge lekin internal changes kaise badloge. umaar ke hisaab body destroy hoti hai better hai jo hai hai bas usko acche se maintain karo baaki upper walle ki haat main hai. Artifical se orignal achhaa hai
Karishma Kapoor surgery se pehli hi jayada sunder thi...
Plastik sargary nahi karvani chahiye go insane ko Allah tala ne diya hai vo bahut achcha hai agar vo kisi bhi chiz changing karti hai to bahut badsurat dikhti hai
Surgery ka best effect kvl Mouny Roy pr his h... Unko iski need t.. And she looks so beautiful now... Baki sb NE Apna face bigada... Lunch Ho zaroort ni t fir v Kiya h....
Say no to cosmetic surgery.

Ayesha takia ne apne takiye ka bhi surgery kiya he😂😂😂😂
Some of them might have just had a glow up... Accusing someone of doing something when you aren&#39;t sure about it isn&#39;t a good thing

Natural beauty matters
Ayesha takes looked too horrible after surgery
but most of them ruined their face like recently i watched dil bole hadipa and rakhi was looking very gorgeous and now she looks like ghost. Similar is the case with ayesha takia and sri devi. Anushka also looked so bad in KWK but then she enhanced her surgery
Sridevi rounded face turn into long sock karishma also anuska is beautiful before surgery looks sruti Hassan but after surgery her cuteness loss.
Our own skin is the best skin then the plastic surgery

Ya thatvgood you want to improve your face but natura is natural  that my opinion that your life whatever you want to do in your face that not our problem

No comments all actress looks are fake they shd have had their true beauty
Kon kya karega unki apni choice hay obviously
Oee pagal hema malini became old that&#39;s why her face became like this

nehi chahiye
Allah ne  jaisa bnaya h waise hi rhna chahiye nachural chijo se  chhedh chhad krna  bhot gunah h
I think every one has right to b beautiful by their own way of perception they have right to b wtever they want to (as long it doesn&#39;t harm others)but in my personal opinion they were also very beautiful even before the surgery and had a natural glory which I like very much in every thing every living being 😊♥️
the sad part is none of them needed any work.
All plastic dolls nothing is real ..they look awful...
I hate Rakhi Sawant😒😖😵🥴😡
Nhi krni chy srgry

Which  god has given us face is only the natural one may the  big big specialists of plastic surgery try their best but one not the other will be not perfect so be happy with ur   face 🤗🤗
No actually I don&#39;t think that film stars need to do plastic surgeries because natural is beautiful...
Money is main important for them . Not their face or body. Just waste of money and their natural face is hone . God gifted face they destroy
No

Surgery is not good <br>Natural beauty is the best
It&#39;s their body their choice
The only people needed plastic surgery in bollywood ever was Sridevi and Shilpa Shetty. Bcoz their nose shape wasn&#39;t as per &quot;beauty&quot; standards. and it turned out dramatically well for them. It enhanced their beauty. for rest it&#39;s dysmorphophobia. a mental disorder which is constant need to look flawless. Plastic surgery has only temporary <a href="http://effects.as/">effects.as</a> u get old it will disfigure ur face as it&#39;s unnatural and dosen&#39;t cope with ur body. Look how Katrina Kaif looking now. but it&#39;s root cause is constant pressure by &quot;Men&#39;s beauty standards for women&quot; in glamour industry as thers very low number of women who got control. these poor women are victims and puppets of their system. I seriously think if women controls and get all the power to beauty standards, there will be a much lower pressure on women and normal for us

Netural look is better and beutiful ... No surgery
I think there isn&#39;t anything wrong with getting plastic surgery when it can either actually make you more beautiful or you really need to get one done....But for people who are already beautiful they should think a 100 times before they go ahead and ruin their faces...then again there is nothing wrong with mild adjustments which would not have much side effects but going for repeated surgeries is only going to lead to health hazards and not beauty...by the way I don&#39;t know if others feel the same but Priyanka Chopra&#39;s nose after surgery kind of looks like voldemort&#39;s nose from Harry Potter 😅

Everyone who is reading this comment I want your opinion that  if you are going out with some guy but later he tells you himself that he has done nose job as he was always insecure about it will you still go out with him or judge him based on his previous looks and 2 ques that if you have gone through for any sort of plastic surgery shoud you tell your partner like for ex I got nose job done I met some guy two three later and we started going out should I tell him about my surgery or not

Lmao... In india you have to get a plastic surgery for being an actor because your talent is not needed in the movies, just some dancing and looks would be all. The great actors who don&#39;t look very attractive are not appreciated here! Producers, directors or even some audience just wants to see some pretty faces not actors.
Natural beauty always appreciable
Shilpa Shetty ko bhool gyi aap

Natural looks are always good, dont do experiments with ur natural looks even daily makeup with lots of cosmetics is also very harmful. <br>Try to stay natural, if u want to change anything that makes u look most beautiful then make ur inner beauty more beautiful
be natural enjoy and accept natural looks <br> some of them look horrible(chhudail) after plastic surgery <br>I still fail to understand how priyanka Chopra got that tittle, kuchh toh jhol hai.
