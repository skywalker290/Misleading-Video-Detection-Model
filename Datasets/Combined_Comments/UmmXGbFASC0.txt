Dom walking in the beat gets me everytime
❤😂🎉😢😮😅
Please give me the name of the song from the first movie?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=3">0:03</a> when she says her parents aren&#39;t home
Take your time walking to the car dominick.....
If we learned 1 thing for certain, here...those streets are dusty as hell.
The cinematography throughout this sequence is epic.
I love how earlier in the movie, Dom said he was afraid to drive his dad&#39;s Charger.. he was left with no choice but to drive the car he was afraid of to avenge his buddy Jesse.
what is the name of the background music?
When Fast and Furious was about Street Racing before they ended up being GTA online 😂😂
Who here after the sexual assault allegations???
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=84">1:24</a> is what I’m really here for lmao 😂😂 I love that v6 growl
The way the charger roar echos at :19😮
Name of the somg in the begining? They had a video of it back in 2016 but they took it down. Dont remeber the name.
I don&#39;t know why they decided to just kill all the original characters and add some clowns to the crew
Whenever I walk fast I hear that techno music that plays when Dom walks to the charger 😂
RIP PAUL WALKER 🕊️
Dom actually went to save Brian.
the best part of this scene is right after brian checks johnnys pulse and confirms he’s dead, and he hears torettos car, as soon as he hears it, he gets absolutely terrified. you can see it in his eyes, and confirm it in his voice. it’s great.
Is that a Supra?
&quot;Gave his mark his car keys and let him slip away... that&#39;s why he&#39;s not a cop anymore.&quot;
The music is LITERALLY Burnout 2: Point of impact, mainly when Brian clicks on the button for the nitro. Literally Burnout 2 man.

Do Vin Diesel Or Paul Walker Talk In This Clip?
That 600 round magazine on the gun is impressive.
My expectations:<br><br>Dom&#39;s crew (Dom, Letty, Jesse, Leon, &amp; Vince) with Brian vs. Johnny&#39;s crew with Lance Nguyen (melee fight) in the final battle but it never happened.
Dom walks to the beat of the music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=4">0:04</a>
😂
Every comment be like:<br>Back when they were only racing...
It’s crazy how this movie is now 22 years old
when FF was great
I prefer this kind of fast and furious. Not the other ones with films becoming too high tech with mercenaries, global terrorism and submarines. I like it when it involves just criminal gangs and street racers.
You killed my friend. Think I&#39;m gonna let that fly?
This film was so good compared to the rest of the dogshit films that followed. 2fast 2furious was okay.
Paul Walker is way better than that actor Keanu Reeves.
Honestly, still waiting for Jessie to miraculously return to the franchise 😂
which song in the beginning???
Part of me is still holding out as Johnny Tran was saved and is a cyborg whos been behind ALL of this and itll be revealed in Fast 37
We don’t get in to that.
He Shot Just Below His Lungs So He Had To Live
Brian He Just Below Anuff To Take Him Down With His 45 Automatic. Nothing To Kill Him But Just Anuff To Put Him Down And He Checked His Vitals Afterwards.  Now A Smaller Calbiuer Would Have Most Likely To Him Out.  Even From 15 To 20 Feet Away
Its Possible Johnny Tran And Lance Made It Outta The Fight.  I Lance Did.  He Was Stunned Johnny Tran Was Shot In His Side But It&#39;s Possible He Did Live Some How Though
Badass car man ❤ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=9">0:09</a>
So im guessin lance isnt dead
Tran survived this and will seek for revenge in the next F&amp;F
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=118">1:58</a> Holy s that was horrible 😂😂
You know what I don’t get.. how come Brian uses nos in a very steep downhill? Shouldn’t that Supra have wings and fly across the city 😭😭
It is cheesy but it has a simple and good story, good cinematography, and good acting for the most part. I wish this franchise stuck to its roots.
😂😂😂Dom Kill Lance
22 years of this movie, and i swear this movie makes my happy when i see
The way they changed the sounds of the cr250 aha
Universal is dead.
The guy shooting had unlimited ammo 😂

This entire soundtrack is sick. Which is it by BT?

Ceh dom pun bawak kereta itu mengejar kawan nakal nya
Cant believe when you compare this to new fast 9 shooting guns on the air like star wars
What&#39;s the name of the song playing in the background?
Lance fired all those rounds and didn’t reload once. This was pre-John Wick firearm realism in movies. 😂

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=110">1:50</a>
Faster
So funny when people say they miss the old movies when they were about racing. FF never was about racing, cars just had a bigger part in the movies but it was always an action movie. <br><br>Yes, they totally overdo with the action scenes in the new movies. Logic and physics almost don&#39;t exist but I really enjoy that. Action movies don&#39;t need to be realistic in my opinion.
Back when dom and brian still drive a car like a normal
I&#39;ve always thought that was a pretty cool kill by Brian.
Lance is definitely not dead.
What’s the name of this song
See, this is how you make a action scene with balls. No dramatic trombone music, no flying drone camera angles or any of that stupid s*it.
I wish this was the last fast and furious
The score for this scene is 🔥 🔥
ぽ
WHY can&#39;t they make movies like this anymore!?
meh ded bight meh a slurpa
Dukes of Hazzard and Fast and Furious are the reasons why I want a 2nd gen Charger
Shooting like a stormtrooper
What is the name of first song? Please
My homie really loves Don&#39;s car the orange one
Back when Dom didn&#39;t have Infinity Stones
This badass stop and shooting in the end is so cool, they still didn&#39;t maked anything cooler than this in the following 8 movies, bruh. F&amp;F turned into some strange Indian movie.
Paul will always be remembered Rest in Peace Paul Walker
just hearing that Hemi start 🤤🤤
The coolest cop car in existence
I love  the cars so so so much especially the big badass  Dodge Charger
I always expected lance to come back looking for revenge after Brian killed Johnny I hope before the series ends Lance appears one last time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=115">1:55</a> whatd he kick out?

Name of the song in this video??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=35">0:35</a>
“This is officer Brian O’Conner in pursuit of two motorcycles involved in a drive by shooting. Back up requested.” Or something to that effect seems more logically now that his cover is blown, but it just wouldn’t be as cool ya know.

Johnny had a smg to kill Brian, Brian only needed 5 shots to kill Johnny.
This is what Johnny and Lance get for<br>Destroyed Brian eclipse<br>Shot Jesse car <br>Killed Jesse
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=45">0:45</a> <br><br>There is no way Johnny missed 100 shots at that range while spraying and praying. <br><br>(Yes I know a Mac 10 realistically can’t hold a 100 shots in a stick mag that short but its Hollywood. What do you expect)
i miss the old fast and furious so much where paul walker was playing in movies back then the whole world sucks without him around

That silenced pistol has a lot of ammunition.

the bike&#39;s engine sound is amazing

When fast and furious wasn&#39;t mission impossible
Since Tran and Lance just committed 3 counts of attempted murder, possession of illegal arms and 1 count of first degree murder their parents can’t bail them out of this one.
Brain&#39;s supra is jumping high as a rally car
Moment of silence for the 2 stars that are gone: Paul Walker... and now that Supra :(
Man the good old days when the camera was shaking like an earthquake and confusing me where to look so much

They did this scene wrong in this movie <br>Jesse got shot in his leg and twice in his arm and survived<br>And in part 2  Brian visits him in the hospital then Brian goes on the run <br>Jesse comes back in 4 or 5 especially part 5 along with Vince but didn&#39;t happen 😕
After watching the 9th movie of the franchise it&#39;s nice to look back and see that physics used to be alive
Sad
Fast and Furious is an example on how to stretch a film franchise to the point where is about to rip
Do the police just not exist in this world?

2021 anyone?
POV: When that one kid owes you money
Since the series has gone so unpredictable with all these deaths I’m guessing Mr. Nobody was hiding some where underneath that tunnel and Johnny Tran And Lance fake their deaths.
This is what GTA v online was like before the rocket bikes and deluxos
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=74">1:14</a> Is when you can see the shattered glass on Brian’s Supra. It’s crazy that there’s a blooper!
The music in this is so memorable! Everytime I think of this scene I hear <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=61">1:01</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=35">0:35</a><br><br>The tracks in F&amp;F 4 - 8 I can&#39;t recall besides a couple like &quot;See You Again&quot; and &quot;We Own It.&quot; But those weren&#39;t really ambient tracks like these ones.

I’ve always found the shot of them jumping down the street, combined with the subdued music, to be so striking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=61">1:01</a>
they should have later pretended that Jesse survived the drive by gunshot so that he could come back to F9.

Entonces este es el doblaje original de rápido y furioso ya me vi toda la saga pero sinceramente el que más me gustó fue el primero el segundo el tercero y el 4 lo demás ahí estan pero bueno la que más me gustaron fueron esas
What did he kick with his foot when he fell on the bike?
Cut at the best part: CALL 911!

I love it how when Brian fires his gun, it sounds like a movie-cliched silencer. You know <b>joop joop joop</b> in reality, silencers are more like a loud <b>pss pss pss</b>
the fast and the furious is the only movie in this franchise with raw scenes.  This and Tokyo Drift somewhat.<br>everything else since has been just junk.
Motocross bike could never keep up with a car lmao
All this and no cops

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=153">2:33</a> the on the back he is like minding his own business. That’s gun shots??? Whatever I must keep walking like there is no dead people behind me.
Motorcycle guy 1: <b>Slams into side of doms car</b><br>Also Motorcycle guy 1: <b>Flies off a mountain at full speed</b>
Oh man
His dad&#39;s charger is daddy of God
The first wheelie he did in this movie was hot the other ones were ok but this wheelie in the movie WAS HOT!
bro rip paul walker
How on earth can a motorcycle outrun a supra
So what do the guys on the motor cycles just have infinite rounds
😂😂😂

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=35">0:35</a> BT - Enter The Eclipse
wow empty street, what day was that on? sunday?
Well Lance should still be alive but Johnny Tran bit the dust
IM A ELITE GODLY JOCK OF 2020 🏈💯💪🏽🇹🇹🏈💪🏽‼️🔥
I used to love this scene a fuckton when I was a kid, until I noticed they reused scenes and took out cars for some and then brought them back in another.<br>noticing that kinda ruined this for me, but hey I still love this movie overall
I love you Toyota supra
As I’m a fan of the film like this paul Walker will be much missed
I thought suppressed weapons hides the muzzle flash.
.
when the movies were good before they drived the franchise into the ground .
The machine gun  never seem to run out of bullets lol
So that supra wasn&#39;t fast enough to catch some dirt bikes without nitrous? It supposed to beat a supercharged bigblock race car?
Nostalgiaa
The way he pulled up and blasted Johnny with that 45 was so smooth. That was such a great shot, they don’t do anything that classy in the following 6 movies and it makes me sad.
براهيم
Fast and the furious 10 they return tran and Lance return
My favorite part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=111">1:51</a>
That techno beat with the Charger rolling out awakened a love for cars in me as a kid that will never fade.
F&amp;F best scene
Their accuracy is worse than stormtroopers&#39;
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=115">1:55</a> he said &quot;Looks like team rocket&#39;s blasting off again&quot;
He escaped before the car blew up
Han is still alive
Bien que corres
No. That. Fast 1
Fast 2. Nothing
I hate Johnny Tran
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=13">0:13</a><br><br>Still remains my favourite car in the entire franchise. The almighty 1970 Dodge Charger. This car is a beast!
I bet you they gonna name drop Jesse in fast 9

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=159">2:39</a>  I bet you couldn&#39;t tell Ford had a chunk of sponsorship dunked into this movie.  lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=30">0:30</a> this will always be my second favorite part in this movie
9 years later, if you&#39;re watching this you&#39;re a legend.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=35">0:35</a> i love the music
If only Universal didn&#39;t milk the Fast and Furious franchise when it became more silly and flashy and after Paul Walker&#39;s passing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=35">0:35</a> is the best moment
That supra is a legend for sure
This is the chase that made the supra g of jdm
Soundtrack?
This is like boyz in da hood
I love the walk up to the charger
The trance music really suits it
Song?
While Filming this the guy on the red bike actually broke his leg during this.
I miss paul walker😢😢😢
are these asians strorm troopers?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=4">0:04</a> whats the original beat? know thats BT but title?
Play stupid games, wins stupid prizes!!! Lmfao.
The 20 speed gearboxes, the 30 mile runway and the 500 shot magazines.
Strange seeing the cars and bikes driving down a real road 🤣
Their do their guns look like a suppressed smg from Fortnite
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=4">0:04</a> My grandfather has a 67 Chevelle SS all black he gave me,  first time I went to drive it I walked like dom and thought of this scene exactly lol
Still can&#39;t believe they haven&#39;t brought Johnny Tran back from the dead yet ........... Maybe in Fast 10 he will be as some sort of cyborg ninja vowing revenge following on from the rest of nonsense with returning characters to the series.
Moral of the story you shouldn&#39;t welcome Chinese to America
This movie deserved an Oscar compared to the sequels.
Confirmed Johnny Tran Will back in Fast 13
Bro when dom walks up to his car, gives me chills lol.
this scene always bugged me how the uzi had unlimited ammo and he never had to reload.
It amazing how they can hit all thw other car but not even one bullet on his car .
The good old Fast and Furious. Back when it used to be about cars and racing.
can someone tell me the soundtracks from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=5">0:05</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=35">0:35</a> ???
Dude&#39;s firing a mac like a airsoft
Isn’t the guy DK from Tokyo drift? No? Just me? Ok...
YES! I have a Fast and Furious car! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=160">2:40</a> I had that exact color and year Ford Taurus Wagon!
R.i.p paul walker
I really love this chase scene and it’s awesome and cool
Just could not understand why the streets were so empty without traffic...
THAT&#39;S A LOT OF DAMAGE

Cleb
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=34">0:34</a> in my opinion one the best parts in the whole movie
They got trash aim fr
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=119">1:59</a> that sounds like it kinda hurts
They need to play this song in one of the fast and furious movies as a way of saying &quot;okay we get it this us the last movie no more after this&quot;
Watashi Wa tanin hay que cogerla Sólo que pasaron en la moto

Love you
I need boy friend
Nobody:<br><br><br><br>The charger and Supra: <b>you wanna see some real speed</b>
It’s great that Dom ignored Mia’s pleas not to get involved. Otherwise Brian would have gotten killed if you think about it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=76">1:16</a><br><br> pause it, Did you see head?
Swear to god,if i found out the paul walker&#39;s homie that makes paul died at crash still alive,im gonna bust his damn ribs, wash his hair using gasoline, and throws a wooden match at that

Brian Transitions from a cop....... its a great scene!!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=45">0:45</a> Funny how he hit everything but the Supra. Next time he should try to aim for everything else.
Paul washer....we miss u brian...
Jordana looks good in that scene.
Fast and furious make the Toyota supra famous
It&#39;s an amazing machine....r.i.p lance

Vin Diesel Looked So good back then
When this franshise had more Drive and less nonsense.<br>Sad.
Song????
Plot twist: so you know in F&amp;F Tokyo drift? The bikers are actually the idiots with the 350Z’s. And in 1 of the F&amp;F guys on motorbikes had SMG’s which they have here. So the bikers are the kids with the 350Zs.
The second shooter look like Han
when that guy fell down the hill lmao
Fast 1 &amp; 3 are by no doubt the best in the franchise<br>This was the official remake of Point Break
I get goosebumps when he presses the nos button
Me every time I get in my car <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=3">00:03</a>
ANDRÉ    SOUZA    DE     CERQUEIRA
His aim is potato like holy
Lollll<br>They got pinged in the end...<br>😂😂😂🤩
Plot twist:<br> the car was saying “Dom yes” when Mia was saying “Dom no”. You couldn’t hear it because Dom has challenger powers
RIP  Paul Walker
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=4">0:04</a> yo cuando mis amigos hacen joda y no me llaman

To think if the got 13mil views think of the actual movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=143">2:23</a> The way Brian immediately pops out his semi automatic and starts shooting at Johnny was just so smooth and amazing
Then Dom is jumping cars from skyscraper to skyscraper in Dubai 14 years later.
Triceps bigger than my future
Just peeped they reused a few clips in the chase 🤦🏽‍♂️ and copy-pasted the clip of the Supras first jump as the second jump
Notice the person the purple just walking randomly in the background after Brian takes out Tran? Like, what the hell? Lol
yesss paul walker is survive yes go go !!😨

Win Brian&#39;s Toyota Supra Aerotop in Fast &amp; Furious Presents Hobbs &amp; Shaw - Downfall.
I thought Johnny Tran (Rick Yune) was still in the Honda S2000.
Everyone knows if speed kills in the charger r/t that&#39;s &#39;cause it&#39;s got V10 from the Dodge Viper.
Dom&#39;s Dodge Charger R/T: (engine screaming)
Jesse (Chad Lindberg) gets killed by the killers &amp; both Dom &amp; Brian (Paul Walker &amp; Vin Diesel) chase &#39;em down.
When Dom stormed toward and got into the beast itself, you knew it was over
I watch this move since I was 2 and that is when i fell in love with car culture
I wanna know what dirt bikes their riding
Oh if only these characters knew what was in for them in the later movies.
Hhm an Uzi holds up to 40 rounds... shoots 500 per minute... so it&#39;s empty after 5 seconds continuous fire... and those guys were firing about the of the half time in this scene, about 1,5 minutes, meaning they needed 750 rounds in that magazine... hollywood at its best
Cool

I still dont under stand how much bullets are in his uzi
The point is when the villain shot, it can&#39;t hit the main character
RIP paul Walker u will always be a great actor who always drives suit up cars
Has anyone noticed that they used 2 of the same shots?
I don’t care what everyone says..yeah after fast 4 we forgot what racing was but all the story ..cmon guys..I love all F&amp;F!!
that Supra will still look good 50 years from now.

Right as the Fast and Furious music came on, it was on.

Who&#39;s here after f9 trailer?
If Lety and Han can survive car explosions, then Johnny Tran and Lance is still alive for sure.
Does anyone know the name of that first song as doms walking to the charger??

If they had there crotch rockets they would of got away easier
Owning a 2003 mitchibishi eclipse i would take any car from fnf supra and the 98 eclipise especially
I love import cars
This is what happens when you&#39;re Vietnamese and you try to kill american people without hiding among the trees.

Such an underwhelming death scene
R.I.P Paul Walker still hard to believe you passed away
Sorry, but I will forever prefer Muscle, to Import
I Love this vídeo <br>💙🚘🏍
Where is all the traffic lool
The best FnF films have the asian dude in the red bike.
At least Lance lived....
Hahaha surprise!
There&#39;s no way that gun has that big of a clip
Notice the exhaust on the red dirt bike is to a 2 stroke but making 4 stroke sounds
Has anyone ever noticed that they passed by that old red Lincoln about 70 times?😂😂😂
He died and the franchise died with him
🤔
So the chinese cousin is alive.. they could bring him back for revenge
It was him who killed han
This 3 minute clip alone is better then the new movie. :|

Yo how much ammo is in this dude&#39;s gun.... got a mag of 200 in a sub
That dude will kill it as a Stormtrooper. Hits everything else but the car he&#39;s aiming at.
Tran is the best villain in the series.
Ok
Fhfog
So... the guy Tran just went from selling stolen stuff and car racing to murder for a car?<br>Shortly after the cops raided his stock?<br><br><br>Ok...

Real smart doing wheelies while trying to get away from a crime scene and being chased. Definitely a priority.
rest in peace Paul &lt;3 now that i look back it just makes me feel sad.
They should have used this song in the final film
So is the windshield of the supra broken or nah

2019? R.i.p paul😭😭
The most realistic film in the series
Yup, ALL about cars and racing
B  m<br>M
This movie is such royalty it should be off of All Platforms. This could be put up out of stock  for being so iconic. And they bring the movir back  out at the movie theaters every 2 years. That would be special😨😨😨😎😎😎💪🙏✊💴.

Dom gettin in the car is badass as is.
I feel bad for the supra
R.I.P Paul Walker is Best actor Ever
When I see Dom marching towards his dads charger I feel the tension of the scene
In Hollywood:charger is the beast<br><br>In real life:supra is the beast<br><br> I miss these cars and we only get to see cars with weird modifications and stunts that mock Newton himself in the remaining sequels

One of the killers is the guy that beat that guy jesse with his honda
So, this dude just can&#39;t aim!! He sniped every car on the road but Brian&#39;s car 😂😂😂😂
Brian has good accuracy with a 1911 pistol
the motorcyclist&#39;s guns have to be the pistol equivalent of the AK-47: <br>hits everything besides exactly what you&#39;re aiming for

I like how vehicle accidents happen next to Los Angeles graffiti like this and the movie Fallen Down

One of the best moments in all of the fast and the furious movies this will always be my fav part

The Fast and The Furious franchise is still a great franchise in my eyes even The Fate of The Furious wasn&#39;t as bad as people said, I actually enjoyed it because of Mark Sinclair&#39;s exceptional and emotional performance though I&#39;m more of a Paul Walker fan even before the Fast and Furious movies were made.<br><br>P.S Mark Sinclair and Paul Walker are the real Dynamic Duo in my eyes.<br><br>Edit: What would actually surprise some people is that some of the stunts in this movie were performed by Paul Walker himself because he can handle tuned up cars though his stunt double looked a lot like him from a far because he had the same haircut and skin color as well as same outfit.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=176">2:56</a>
The fast and the furious why not fast and furious?

I’m surprised how the Supra doesn’t have an bullet holes. 😧

Paul walker s toyota supra i like his car in the orginal movie
I love this movie
I had the hot wheels version of Brian&#39;s supra when i was a kid and I&#39;d get so hyped to drive it around whenever this scene came up
I&#39;ve always been bothered by the fact that they&#39;re Mac-11s had unlimited ammo. In reality it would only take about 1.37 seconds to empty the magazine.
Man those nerds don&#39;t even know how to shoot on the bike

This is my favorite scene my childhood is here !
I dont get it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=113">1:53</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=114">1:54</a> place. He hits the car in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=113">1:53</a> by side, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=114">1:54</a> he drives like he missed the road :D :D normally in that kind of speed even if you hit a car by bike side driver totally needs to be throw away from bike :D
As an adult I realize that if they had been street bikes that supra wouls have never caught up with the bikes
I guess they never heard of reloading or bullet shells 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=62">1:02</a>, they jumped off a ramp
I would have prefer that Dom was the one Who killed Tran and Brian his cousin

That chargers first roar and it became an instant legend
Oowe se ven la ranplas cuando saltan las motos
The music is called Fourth Echo.
Bruh, from street racing and drive by shootings to jumping out of planes and dodging missiles from nuclear submarines 😂
I love how Dom walks to the beat of the song
ultimate music in all the series is this videos starting seen..i liked it very much
I Totaled my 1st Car thanks to this Movie 😎
I was thinking it&#39;d be cool if Johnny came back as a villain, if possible lol
RIP Paul Walker
This may be an objectively bad movie, but Jesus Christ I love it (all the others do suck though)

Not a single bit of CGI, a realistically shot car chase - the fast and furious films really have fallen from grace.
What song is playing
Hi
Dom, you didn’t let the engine warm up before setting off so you should of kept it under 3000 RPM until at operating temperature. 😂
Piece of shit American muscle. Only good at straight line speed, to an extent. Terrible at everything else

i built the exact same car dom has 900 horse power
I love the sound of the iconic 2jz
anyone know the backround music?
My favorite R.I.P legend (Paul Walker)
Super
Music name??
I miss those times too much, the life was simple and there were real legends in the past. When ı see the film, it reminds me my childhood. We were simple,we were happy with our best friends, we used to play football matches on streets. When I see today&#39;s generation, they look more complicated, they are unhappy because of using mobile phones and pc s too much and friendship is the last thing for new generation.
only thing that would have made this scene better is if Dom would have hit lance with the 12 gauge
I love the soundtrack,goosebumps
Lmao how is it that the gun never runs out of Amo smh🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Bullets didn&#39;t even touch the Supra,

I think he could’ve landed good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=117">1:57</a>

RIP Paul
I love how under the bridge are all those eyes just peeping Brian&#39;s mad skills
Oregon grown, Paul Walker.
Yeah I know dominic kill lance and brain killed Johnny
R.I.P Paul Walker he is my idol
When I see the dirt bikes and Supra jump it’s so satisfying and with the music the movie was perfect
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=35">0:35</a> i love that moment

Dom&#39;s Charger in first F&amp;F movie was the MOST FEAR INDUCING car in the history of cinema. After all these years, I still remember how BRUTAL it sounded at this moment during the plot. Like the car is grunting &quot;watch out I&#39;m coming for you&quot; lol. What a GEM was this movie. Good old days.
How many bullets were in that thing?!
Esse cara de rica esse cara fica esse cara é rico esse cara é Zika

Lol that moment when you realize he should have been put of ammo after the drive by happened
Is that Lombard Street they&#39;re going down and jumping? <br>That street is in so many movies and TV shows. Is it Lombard?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=5">0:05</a> EPIC
That&#39;s what happens when you give the enemy an upper hand or open space. Johnny Tran had to be taken out sometime ago knowing he would attack back.
Anyone know the beat at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=4">0:04</a> ? I tried looking for it years ago, still no luck. And now... I&#39;m hoping someone knows it and can tell me what&#39;s the name of it so I can download it

If the first movie is not your favourite its the second movie,<br>if the second movie is not your favourite its the third movie,<br>if the third movie is not your favourite its the fourth movie,<br>if the fourth movie is not your favourite and neither are the ones stated above, you just typically don&#39;t like the fast and the furious for what it was.
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=10">0:10</a> they got that classic 1990s beat
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmXGbFASC0&amp;t=111">1:51</a>: Dom appeared out of nowhere and wins again.
the beginning part of this clip gives me chills every time
This was like a cars vs bikes tag team duel lol
Remember when fast and the furious was a car film now its just heists
This might sound weird but fast and the furious 1 and 2 was the best ones ever made
