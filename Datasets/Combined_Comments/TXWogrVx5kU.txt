I like filmfare more than coffee with karan... No more fake controversial series just to win a hamper... Agree?
My myan discribing about me love you👸👑👑👑👩‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍👨💕💕💕😇😇😇🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊
I hope Deepika cherishes this man for ever and ever. <br>Every woman desires to get a man who would love and appreciate her immensely, and Deepika is fortunate to get one.
Deepika be like : My soul only fir you Tanveer, but my hole is for everyone!

he&#39;s just ken, she is everything
He s wearing red pants but he s a walking green flag 😂❤
deepika is so lucky to get a gentleman
Ranbir u are a super actor &amp; a super person 👌👌👌
Perhaps one of the very few celebrities that you can see and say &quot;you get what you see, see what you get&quot;
The interviewer reminds me of Saroj khan
Deepveer❤️
Are yr he is best literally 🥺😍
The biggest fan  of Deepika in the world has to be Ranveer  handsdown🙌 omg even after marriage he is obsessed with her beauty, her charisma, her attitude, behaviour what not, he is mad about her 🥰 which husband in the world would adopt his wife surname such a humble human 😍
Bollywood ka upcoming megastar
Ranvir and deepika made for each other such a beautiful couple ❤
She has always problem with Ranveer Singh&#39;s surname she never proudly accept like other actress like Kareena Kapoor Khan and Priyanka Chopra Jonas Whoever addresses her like Deepika Padukone Bhavani Singh, she interrupts them. I mean I don&#39;t understand At least once, with love, Say with your name by putting his surname.but no even he has no problem with addressing him Ranveer Singh Padukone he love her so much ❤️ he literally adore the floor that she walks on 😩 she don&#39;t deserve him 🙌
Basically Ranveer Singh is real life Chandler!
Virat &amp; Anushka, Ranveer &amp; Deepika Their Love Chemistry, Intimation, independence is Lovely. They Are The Top Model Of Conjugal Love.
Dear God... wanna husband like Ranveer😍😍
I genuinely love him and they both are rab ne bana de jodi 😍😍❤️<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23deepveer">#deepveer</a>
Deepika couldnt take the surname of Ranveer&#39;s but Ranveer is happily accepting the so called &quot;Padukone &quot; title that&#39;s ringed to him in this interview !!! He is the gem of Men !!!
Deepveer love you pls one interview of deepveer
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXWogrVx5kU&amp;t=120">2:00</a>
I love ranveer singh. Love from Morocco
If Ranbir Kapoor comes in your life wait for ranveer singh.
Wow he said so nicely all the gully boy rap song
Ranveer is a perfect boyfriend,husband,partner
why does he talk about Deepika like a beast. PLS - 🤣🤣😭😭😭
I admired as an actor already, but with this interview alone, he has become one of the two men who ruined the rest of men for me.
I love the fact that Deepika didn&#39;t change her last name!!
every girl desearves this love
I want a kiss from HIM.
All Capricorn women deserves a man like Ranveer✨💖
Ranveeeeeeer singh is the best!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Deepika Deepika Deepika . You so lucky ufff .. blessed with such an amazing loving person uffff.
Only deepika padukone have enough patience to handle his craziness
I wish God will send to me also a husband same like   him
Very genuine person.......
Guys, everyone thinks all this is really romantic and all. But seriously, everything he says is about looks, hotness and &quot;primal&quot; thoughts. Honestly, i would be upset if the guy that loved me talked about me like that. he also said he couldnt believe he bagged a chick like her in another interview. Sorry but this couple looks like a highschool couple that just started having sex.
I like ranveers rap
I love how he answered that question about ranbir. Nothing but facts.
He is a pakka husband material u damn it 💜
Amazing Super Fantastic
homeboy&#39;s IN LOVE in love
I love you ranveer the way of respect and Ur love towards woman and it&#39;s luck to Deepika to have u in life
Failure of loves lead her to choose the best of her choice who the men die for him totally that&#39;s ranveer ram chahe Leela happy couple
Loved this Filmfare .....To the point talks ... No Fake Topics or Gossips ...and very short timing which are good enough instead of getting bored I must say....💯👍♥️♥️♥️
❤️❤️❤️
Ranveer Singh is christian??
This kind of boys are required in the world.
Jesus he is so telented
Ranveer Singh is looking very handsome 😍
Jesus forgive this man for taking Your name in vain. He&#39;s a naive man.

Shame on you bastard... Anil kapoor&#39;s nephew. Your billionaire dad did pay for your debut it was not 10 lakh, may be 10 or 20 crore. SHAME ON YOU RANVEER for lying and playing politics with sushant
respect
Well, it is Deepika Padukone and I’m sure he’s lucky to have her too.
what a cheesy idiot
चरसी फैमली😂
Ncb inke peeche lagi ..
Over smart ..joker ...and charsi
Deepveer❤️
He looks high in this interview:.i think he’s on drugs..his eyes look wierd...
He is love❤
Why all gays have same accent
OMG HE’S AN ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!👏🏻💕
Don&#39;t like this host.
Ranveer literally worships the ground she walks in🥺❤️

She is the luckiest girl! 😋✌❤😣
she&#39;s so gharelu that she consumes and operates the biggest drug cartel company. oh boy
Wwooaahh that rap.... loved you for that ranveer 🌹🌹🤩🤩🤩
Get lost
Hearing this again knowing  ranveer is on drugs all day, this interview makes more  sense now..
He is coke d up all day that&#39;s why acting all so much in love. <br>Looks fake..<br>True couples settle in post 6 years of love..and not so exicted like 1st 6 months of a neq relationship... even abhishek bachan isn&#39;t so excited about  beautiful aishwarya after 6 years...then why is ranbir building up deepika s beauty so much .. definetly LSD drugs effect..this one clearly faking to make girls believe. Druggie couple
Ranveer has a very English accent, like he is speaking Punjabi English. Ranveer bhai, just stick to your native language.

Feel free to delete my comment but you can’t silence the voice of Indian masses. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywood">#BoycottBollywood</a> In losing SSR, India lost a national treasure, an exemplary human being, an academic, an epic actor, a true philanthropist, a jack of all trades. We, the Indian masses won’t stop until the entire criminal nexus involved in SSR’s murder from Bollywood to drug cartel to politicians to Mumbai police is publicly exposed, charged in court, legally prosecuted &amp; given death sentences. CBI must must must demonstrate their fairness in probe by concluding it with all the big and small fish involved in the murder exposed . <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23iamsushant">#IAmSushant</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#Justice4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23middleclassmatters">#MiddleClassMatters</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23reportforssr">#ReportForSSR</a>

The interview   guy looks  n behaving  like a gay  ..Ranveer looks grt.
The one and only undisputed legend of a Bollywood, an exemplary human being and a national treasure, Sushant Singh Rajput ❤️ Complete boycott of Bollywood, do not click on any of their videos, do not view, do not comment, do not like or dislike. Down with Zoya &amp; Farhan Akhtar, Javed Akhtar, Shabans Azmi for supporting the influential criminals guilty of murdering a national treasure, an icon, a legend, Sushant Singh Rajput. All Bollywood celebrities have shown their true colors...Bachan family, Akshay Kumar, Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Kareena Kapoor; not one word requesting inquiry into a murdered legend, SSR. We will not be silenced or distracted or fooled by Rhea, Pithani, Pancholi, Khan, Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena, Baby Penguin, Mumbai Police. Indians, all over the world have their eyes on Republic TV, Ujjwal Trivedi, Ishkaran Bhandari, the Supreme Court of India and CBI. Maharashtra Govt and Mumbai police are involved and protecting the true criminals. They have reasons to cover up the murder of a legend. All their actions and mishandling of the case are evidence enough of their guilt. Shameful that major Indian media channels are still not giving SSR the fair share of coverage. They’re scared...just like the Bollywood celebrities. If SSR fails to get justice, the common man of India will have no shot at justice ever again. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#Justice4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbiforssr">#CBIForSSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23globalprayers4ssr">#GlobalPrayers4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywood">#BoycottBollywood</a>

India lost a national treasure, Sushant Singh Rajput. Bollywood lost an icon. Not one word from filthy Ranveer Singh &amp; his likes!!! Down with Zoya &amp; Farhan Akhtar, Javed Akhtar, Shabans Azmi for supporting the influential criminals guilty of murdering a national treasure, an icon, a legend, Sushant Singh Rajput. You chose to side with the oppressor and the murderers. We will remember where you stand on this. It is NOT a witch hunt or a media trial as you would like to portray on your fictional narrative. It’s but the opposite. If this was Farhan hanging from the ceiling fan, would you claim the same position?!Hypocrisy! All Bollywood celebrities have shown their true colors...Bachan family, Akshay Kumar, Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Kareena Kapoor; not one word requesting inquiry into a murdered legend, SSR.

I feel like this is little fake.. over acting
fly all the way across the world to see your partner  just for some minutes??????. okay dude is a keeper
Every single one of his answers about Deepika revolves around her appearance and body..  yet another shallow superficial body obsessed male 🤦🏻
Wife Obsessed men 😂😆
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXWogrVx5kU&amp;t=343">5:43</a>;people should watch this interview before being blind haters thank you so much ranveer for talking abt this..being a son of businessman or being a relative of a star doesnt make anyone guilty its upto people now how they see these actors..1 yr ago people were dropping adorable comments for ranveer and deepika n since one month they are constantly hating ranveer singh i just request you all not to be blind haters just coz of some rumour or some other hate-deserving people.
He is crazy about her 💕

Lol When ur husband is ur biggest fan

I really love the fact that ranveer actually accepted, acknowledges and talks about deepika&#39;s heartbreak so that he can pamper her rather running away from the fact. Plus both of them have no bad blood with Ranbir
You&#39;re really an amazing actor .. just people are jealous of ur success that&#39;s y they talk shit abt u =_=
If she&#39;s not gorgeous... Then the love is going to be the same??
Jesus Christ ??😒😒Christians never say hindu god name

Bssic Primal thoughts means
Deepika is so lucky to have such an amazing husband
Nice couple Allah inko khush rake Ameen
The way he say nazar na lage mere baby ko
💓
Why do all these interviewers behave so gay?? Do they not understand ki surf Karan Johar Jaise behave Karne se koi interviewer Accha Nahi ho jata
God he is so much in love with her..oh gosh😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
He is so so so HOT 👌👌😍😍😍
I see tangled Eugine in ranveer don&#39;t know why
He is so confident and yet has no ego to show and tell how much he admires and loves deepika. Usually guys who &#39;appear&#39; confident never really show girls how much they are crazy about them because of their stupid ego and arrogance.
I love the host
😘😘😍😍
Omg they are so lucky to have each other. I wish to have a boyfriend like him, he is such a sweetheart. An absolute dream he is. I don’t know how she doesn’t blush 24/7.
Actresses love newcomer co-actors they work with but then marry someone with big family surname or business ... But Deepika was different .
Yr I wish I could get a husband like ranveer sing I mean he is perfect idol for husband the way he cares her understand her and importantly he proudly says that she mine awww that feeling is uncountable ❤😘😘😘
Both Ranveer &amp; Deepika are such a sorted people ❤ilovethemmm
Ranveer ur rap is too gud😍😍😍😍😍
This is awwwwwww 😘 😘 😘 😘 😘. Every grl needs a man like him

ye sala joker ugly kale hoth wala ranveer singha is fimfare editor ke sath sex karta hai tabhi award milate hai award derseve shahid for kabir singh aur is gandu joker ko mil gaya aur gay jesa pose bana ke insta pe award wali photo award start se pahele hi dal di award ka bhukha ugly ranveer
Ran veer how u memorized all this and l wants every husband love his wife the way u present ur love to deepika
Ranveer is the legend of bollywood
Sala jam Bollywood me karte he or jesehi interview deneka aata he ye sale Hollywood star banjate he Angrej ki olad ban jate he 😂
Their love story proves that you should marry a person who is crazy about you and not a person whom you are crazy about. Now that even she is crazy about RS though
Ranveer Singh very down to earth person ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nazar na lage Meri baby ko😍😍😍😍😭
He is just awesome
This guy is cool
God this interviewer is so f***ing irritating.
This guy is an energy ball.
Superstar! Love for him
Thank you ranveer.
Liked for the ad 👍
Sale in sbko desh bikala krna hoga...sale ye mota pkka firngiyo ka awlad hai .. ak word bhi hindi nhi bola
Love u man..No one like you!!❤❤😍 Soo genuine and charming!
So blessed.... wow. I can watch this man and his woman if they are on a movie of  everyday like kardashians. Better lessons, better and divine unity. So much to be hopefull and so much to look upon. Bless bless🙏 the best husband of our times. Deepika and her rabne banadi jodi is a blessing on earth. 😊
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXWogrVx5kU&amp;t=321">5:21</a> gotcha!!<br>He has to make his own decisions and not getting advised by mother neetu! This was the one of the reasons of their breakup
Omg.What a lover
Very nice person
Love you ranveer
I love ur craziness n how u carry ur in clothes like u own them n confident man hats off love u deepveer❤
I am so shy ☺️🤭😝
This guy got mad when he met deepika
oh wowww...RAVEER SINGH is just awesome 😘😘
Wow.... He really have evolved soooo much... Beyond anybody&#39;s expectations...... Rap was awesome..... He is now 😍😍😍 just after Deepika...
both of Ranveer &amp; Deepika was very lucky to have each other 🥰  also, I need a Ranveer in my life 😩🙏🏻
loves playing “house house” soooo cute
I cant believe I found myself smiling when he started rapping😘
No matter what people say, <br>I adore Mr. Jitesh Pillaai. <br>He is so sweet, warm &amp; affectionate &amp; makes any celeb feel at home....He tries to bring out the hidden side of celebs  without any unnecessary drama or pretensions.<br>Kudos to you Sir.<br>Commendable!
Ranveer is a sweetheart❤<br>A perfect husband material. He is very sensitive &amp; soft...😘<br>Whereas Deepika is too cold sometimes. In so many past interviews , I&#39;ve seen her just ignoring him or letting him down whenever he expresses his love for her. She sometimes makes him feel like a fool in public, by not reciprocating properly.<br>I really hope Ranveer never ever gets hurt. He is such a pure soul.<br>He deserves a lot of happiness 😘❤
Love ranveer rap
Omg .... ranveer Singh is amazing
May someone kindly translate from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXWogrVx5kU&amp;t=145">2:25</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXWogrVx5kU&amp;t=175">2:55</a> the parts that are not in english please? 🙏🏻
I could watch this guy a whole day without moving anywhere....😍😍😍😍😍
I was genuinely impressed by the fact that he can rap without studio effects
He flew from half way across the world to see her for a few minutes.<br><br>Makes me feel so insignificant. 😢<br><br>Although I absolutely love their jodi. They are amazing.<br>All I can say is jo hota hai ache ke liye hota hai. 😅
&quot; Jesus christ &quot; says ranveer
He has a beautiful heart <br>A beautiful wife<br>N a beautiful smile 🥰
I seriously hope my wife does not watch this....common brother don&#39;t set the bar so high for the rest of us.
This guy looks like male Saroj Khan.
Best!!!!😍😍🥰🥰🥰
All Deepveer fans be like &quot;inhe buri nazar se bachao God&quot;
His love towards deepika is beautiful ♥😍 it made me cry😭😍♥
Ranveer singh is amazing Actor! He is Handsome and real.
They are soulmates i can say that because i have my soulmate with me from 3 years and 8 months.he respects me care about me protect me love me and call me jaan in front of her mom also.it&#39;s his upbringing that he is a true gentlemen.
When growing up they used to say rap will be worldwide one day. Well, they were right!!! 🎤
Ye Banda mohabbat krna janta hai😍❤
I love them loads of love to deepveer
Not 10 lakh it was 3 crore
This is called ‘over-acting’
Oh My God... Ranveer Singh... Whyyyyyyyyyy just WHYYYYYYY SO NICEEEEEE?
Ranveer is so loving caring husband Deepika u r so lucky
When both Deepika &amp; Ranveer came into scene almost 10yrs ago I thought they&#39;re kind of fair weather people.. Short time actors..but look how both of them changed my presumptions with their hard work.. infact same happened when their link up rumours were around.. never thought Deepika would marry someone like Ranveer so early.. I mean front row actresses never get this kinda catch.. like someone within industry plus without ex wives, without children, without inter religion stuffs.. only Kajol and Deepika caught the right one👍
Oh my got the Interviewer he is an such an aunty 🤭
Ranveer should really thank Ranbir 😆😁<br>And every girl deserves a man like Ranveer but not everyone are lucky like Deepika❤️
FUCKKK ♥️♥️
I think they bath were drunk.
Why jitesh talk like this? So much irritating
What a pussy twat
Came here after watching Deepika’s interview. Though I am big fan of Deepika, I felt that she has attitude VS Ranveer is so down to earth. Such a lover he is. I must say Deepika is lucky.
Ranveer singh after watching To Dipika Padukone first time  ...he was Thinking  ,&quot; Zindgi Bhar Isko Ko Thokna hain Apan Ko  ,&quot; 👈😂🖕
Deepika is sooo lucky girl
Ohhhhh ranveer u r too good too too too good......u nd deepika make equally pefect couple
Ranveer Singh Bhavnani!!!
Every girl should deserve a husband like her....i want a husband like ranveer singh...
Saala chootiya
ranveer singh, tum jallaad ho, tumne gai ko c*** mein nocha maaraa aur murder karne ki koshish ki, i hate you!
FIRST DILIP KUMAR, THAN RAJESH KHANNA, THAN AMITABH, THAN SHAHRUKH,THAN RANVER SINGH..<br>RANVEER IS NEXT KING
strong man RANVEER
Love you ranveer u have gem of heart love you ranveer
Could he be more annoyingly gay like such a put off the fake gay accent is so fake
Is it legal for him to rap like that.....god he&#39;s amazing:-)
♥️♥️💕😘😘💫💫💫🧿🧿🥰🥰🥰
The way he appreciates her is amazing, this dude is actually amazing he’s not afraid to show how much he’s in love, they hella cutee
God I please deliver my marriage prospects to them.. They are my favorite 😍<br><br>PS: I don&#39;t wanna marry.
You have my heart😍
Someone sees the flaws....n someone sees the right person in one.....ranbir was nthng for her....<br>N this man...is all love😍
I am fall in love after watching his Videos..😆😂
The way Ranveer loves Deepika...i mean it&#39;s every girl&#39;s dream.  He&#39;s awesome...
Deepika is the luckiestttt women
<b>He is adorable.</b><br><b>His royality,his pure heart,his love for her!</b> ❤❤❤<br><b>He is inspiring and lovable.</b><br><b>Blessed be the lovely couple.</b>
Hope to find a ranveersingh in my real life! ❤️
All 772 dislikes are from Ranbir Kapoor and his fake accounts.<br>Actualmy when I saw Ranveer first time(many years ago) I didn&#39;t love him. And I loved Deepika only with Ranbir. I hated Deepveer. 😅😅😅 But then I saw the reality, what Ranbir did to Deepika. And saw Ranveer&#39;s love to Deepika. OMG Deepveer is my favourite couple. They are the best💕 Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi💕
He is amazing .
Chutiya hai yeh.. Yarr sirf chatna aata hai
ranveer bhavnani is good actor
Deepika has literally married her craziest fan
He is NOT a product of Bollywood nepotism, which is great! A total outsider.
Y he is repeating Jesus Christ🙄....
When you marry your crush
Even by not talking about his love for deepika, ...his rapping skills shocks me
He is so charming and kind.. wow!good hearts shine through!
Kaash YouTube me v Love reaction de sakti thi like FB
I really love when ranveer raps 😍😍💯💯❤️
I love how he said &#39;that&#39;s ok&#39; and that he was understanding when they talked about deepu bot acknowledging the relationship.. That was so beautiful.. Like pure love ❤️❤️
I really have a hug respect for ranveer. And I&#39;m so happy at how he answered all questions even those of exes with maturity and openness... Ranveer should start a lesson Husband 101..he is the best friend, lover and husband you can ever get. Really. He loves deepu openly, flawlessly and passionately, genuinely..... I just am so greatful they found each other 😊😊😍💯..i think from what I see of their relationship, they have comfort, trust. And family is the most important to them.. Ranveer should really be the national lover, boyfriend and husband... Always amazing 😘😘.. And he
😂😂😂😂.. Omg.. Ranveer is always so funny and so energetic really.. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I get emotional after watching it..😥....Deepika u are so so lucky..❤<br>And me too becuz I also have a bf😍 like ranbeer singh...who truly loves me...care about me and respect me alot...i love you my mitthu..😥❤❤❤
OMG 😍 frankly I was never a fan of ranveer but after their marriage his approach towards Deepika is incredibly fine 😭 lovely ❤️
Now this is we can call a perfect gentle man! A man with class. Even he knows about Deepika&#39;s ex and all and after getting married he is still mad for her. Wese to Anushka or virat ki bhi sahi chemistry hai but Anushka ne Shaadi se phle kabhi accept nhi kiya that she is in a relationship. And here our dipveer they are just a perfect example for all the couples I love you both. May God bless 😘♥️
Deepika is lucky to have himmm
husband goal right there
such a amazing person  i couldn&#39;t find anywhere 😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘💕💕💕
He is so expressive every single time.
Ranveer ❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥

He makes me craving for a guy someone like him 😍😍😍😍🤪🤪🤪
Ranveer Singh do overacting always...Never looks natural.... Always brags like pheku and fakes his character which also clearly visible in his movies also... But that&#39;s the thing he knows very well to do which is required to become star in Bollywood... Not dislike him but told truth...
Ranbir kapoor is the most luckiest man in bollywood🌟🌟🌟
Apna bhai bohut hard hai...
What a man he is,just super cool and Deepika  is very lucky 😍😘😘
i am a big lover of depu and felt so jealous when heard about ranveer dipika marriage .......but i m also a big lover of ranveer ....he&#39;s a genuine and quality person......touchwood...............both of u are highly inspiring ........my fav couple...........love u dipika and ranveer.........

Ram leela<br>Bajirao mastani<br>Padmavati<br>Sanjay leela bhansali makes superb movies.<br>And those 3 movies done by this awesome married couple were hitts.<br>And all the confession of love ranvir singh made in all those three movies were not just a part of his script. He expressed it genuinely from what he felt internally for real. <br>His expression of emotion towards deepika burst out truely in every movie they have done together.<br>And that&#39;s how Ram leela and the other 2 movies became worth watching. <br>True that no one can love deepika like ranvir does.
He is looking like some other men, in india to their wives, Dont go to work ,we have lot of money.
Pura gana gaa dala yar . Awesome
lucky Ranveer. all the best.<br>Deepika is the truly the living Koh-I-Nur of India...
Every girl want a loving husband like him
There is unlimited love,  he can&#39;t able express it Deepu lucky girl

But I respect my mother tongue to say this word to deepika and ranveer. வாழ்க பல்லாண்டு கல்யாண வாழ்க்கை நூறாண்டு. இதேபோன்று நீங்கள் என்னென்றும் புன்னகையோடு வாழ்த்தும் உங்கள் சகோதரி.
I love and like one and only couple in the world. Yes, there is deepika and ranveer. They are amazing pair and i couldn&#39;t find any pair in the world. See I&#39;m tamilnadu but I love one and only couple deepveer. i want to say tq to sanjay leela bhansali sir. Because he is the reason for their mrg , may be i think soo. Whether it&#39;s right or wrong but this is point of view. <br>So all credit goes to him. <br>And i don&#39;t know to say any words. Such a wonderful couple<br>Loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee YouuuuuuuUuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo muchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<br>Deepika and ranveer😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍<br>If I have a chance to meet any actor and actress in the world, i will suggest, &quot;i want to meet with you&quot;💕💖💕💖💖💖💕💗💗💗💗💗

Something to learn from Ranveer the way he answered the question about Ranbir
Love him and his whole family looked so chilled. His father looked so young. I believe their last name is Bhavnani. So, why did Ranveer become a Singh? Is it a Bollywood name?
yh kis pr telecast hota h.
I couldn&#39;t stop myself to comment..love from Nepal ❤️❤️❤️ ranveer n deepika❤️❤️
Why is he shouting all the time Jesus Christ 😏😏😏😏
That rap though 😍
My god, he is so so i dont think there is a word that can describe RANVEER SINGH. Where did you came from!!!! You made all the girls here mushy gushy. This will put me to happy mood forever!
Aamazing 😍 all time fav Ranvir Singh and Deepika
God bless them 💖💖🎉
For U still I believe that true love does happen..<br>God bless u Mr.Singh

My God deepi so lucky
he is only outstanding 😍😍
I like filmfare becase it bring close to the celebs
Ranveer you are the best😘😘
He is just the same like my husband is....deepika is too lucky....so as me💕💕
It&#39;s annoying to hear him say Jesus Christ repeatedly.. N no hard feelings but I could get tired just hearing him talk even within this short interview 😰
Since Ranbir Kapoor, Kareena and Kjo are the trio ultimate bollywood gossipers; I hope they are listening and viewing these comments section. Dear Ranbir, Pls stop being a spoilt brat, grow up and learn from Ranveer Singh how to love only one woman with all your heart. Kind regards .....
Pls, is there no FilmfAre award 2019 for bollywood movies released in 2018?
Deepika is not lucky to have Ranveer. They both Deserve each other. Just because of who she (her kindness, purity, generosity, loving nature, good heart &amp; warmth) is why her praises and adores her. She gives in her own way to him and that is what he recognizes and adores. If Ranveer was with any other Bollywood actress, this would also not be the version of him the world will see. He is just as lucky to have her.
Pink hearts
He is soooooo cuteeeee♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I just have to see her omg he is so adorable 😍😍😍
Kinna pyaara h Ranveer
This guy should be announced as the national lover of our country <br>Every girl deserves a guy like ranveer Singh.
Very smart answer for ranbir..really he doesnt need any advice.he is such a big flirt.
Dipika is so lucky to have ranveer..
soo adorable dey both r soo gud fr each other
Deepika is blessed to get him after so many break ups.
He truly is such a precious soul. You can see how in love with Deepika he is every second. And I think it&#39;s amazing that Anushka and Katrina came because I feel like a lot of people over exaggerate their lives for drama but we forget they&#39;re real people and I love how they&#39;re all so classy and are genuinely friends.
Everyone in the comments is like deepika is so lucky.. just another example of deep rooted patriarchy.. if the girl spoke like this, she is the crazy lover whereas if the boy talks like this, wowww the girl is so lucky.
That Lovely Hawas Expression :D
&#39;Meri baby ko nazaar na lag ja ve&#39; 😭😭😭 😭😭😭 😭😭😭
Ohhhhh god........... he is....... so..........cute😚
Now i feel like getting marry aftr seeing  ranveer how good husband  cn be

All of these interviews are fun and conversational, except for the one with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. She might be a great person, maybe just not meant for interviews. Just does not open up!

That what I always like abt ranbir singh that he is so so so crazy abt Deepika and so much in love with her. It’s so visible since they r together. He don’t have any male ego and at the same time he is so charming.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXWogrVx5kU&amp;t=299">4:59</a> jesus christ !?<br>now that&#39;s what i call an wanna be American people
❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXWogrVx5kU&amp;t=210">3:30</a>-That’s how a partner should be.Ranveer you are bf/hubby goals 💕
They need to add a new reason for not interested. I have spent 10% of my last 4 months watching his face
Ranveer Singh really rocks ....😘
that&#39;s it only 7 mins... y cant they make it 10 mins
He is the super 🌟
Can anybody tell me Which goggle or shades they are ?
Good rap. didn&#39;t understand it though but it&#39;s SICK
Who broke Deepika&#39;s heart before?
Jitesh and Karan would have been a great couple .. But the problem is they are RIVAL... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23showhosts">#showhosts</a>

That rap ❣️
Ranveer is a pleasure to listen to...his wife on the other hand is such a bore. She’s beautiful and talented but her interviews a mind numbing. She’s so cautious and diplomatic. Ranveer however is energetic and friendly and awesome 👍
Last rap was🔥🔥
I love you deepveer, and I LOVE Famously Filmfare, it is genuine &lt;3
He is truly crazy about her always been since the very beginning. His passion for her is genuine. I hope they take good care of one and other cause marriage is a precious thing that requires work, dedication, devotion and love.

Wow how much passionate he is about DEEPIKA. I like Deepika, and so i started to watch his interviews. This guy is so much love and fun..what a passion and what an energy. And when he told that Deepika was already had a heartbreak and so she needed her time and its so understandable....i just felt that. Where to find such guys. I also found him so humble and yet so crazy. Love from Pakistan.
I am also very lucky like dipika my husband love&#39;s me so much we completed 6years of our marriage my husband surprises me &amp; cares me like before our marriage wen v r in love😍

Need Priyanka in this jitesh
find yourself a man who talk about u like ranveer
An overdose of Ranveer these days. Bechara, how tired he must have become in finding all new ways to constantly impress audience. U r neither a great actor nor a Handsome. May be another 2 years. u cannot never be a sharukh or akhshay to stay in our hearts for a life time.
Such love! 💖💖
I like your show...nice bro...you both r my favourites...
❤❤❤

when these bolllyActors say &quot;Jesus christ&quot;  and sing those rap sons (LOL) it shows how much  copy cats they are of western ,Artificial and feel shameful of their own identity . feel sorry for india. By the way i am not against Christianity i am just talking about how some Indians are cheap copy cats, Artificial and shameful of their own identity.  i hope these Indian realize their real identity and gain self respect again.
Mar  sala  kooo  RS

wow! It&#39;s amazing to see how much Ranveer loves his wife Deepika. Sadly, he&#39;ll get bored of her when they get old.
Love ranveer as actor. Hate watching his narcissistic interviews. Pls be grounded, better in long long
It appears to be a good honest relationship.... let their love grow deeper and become spiritual oneness
I really love ranveer bc the way he is so normal &amp; loveing &amp; good persone
The interviewer is creepy.

He is madly love deepika 😍😍😍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXWogrVx5kU&amp;t=196">3:16</a> I just have to see her ❤️ awww
What wonderful energy! Immense amount of love! And what honesty too.. when he saw her for the first time .. from behind..haha!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRbY1tMEDjI">https://youtu.be/TRbY1tMEDjI</a>
God!! He did my favourite rap!! 😍😍😍 Love him!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
2 Points<br><br>Where are those so called &quot;feminists&quot; when he said he loves seeing Deepika in the &quot;Gharelu&quot; mould . Where are they to create an outrage that &quot;Girls are not only meant for housemaking, kitchen etc&quot; shit...<br><br>Secondly, I know what struggle is for Ranveer Singh. I remember he tweeted that how poor he was that he could not travel to Europe like his friends and had to adjust with a holiday trip to South Africa.
Wowowowowow husband perfectttt
Interview after wedding, not marriage
The way hr talk is just Luv.deepika is very lucky to have such handsome and luving person Luv him yarrrrrrrrrr
my god the interviewer has the most annoying, screeching voice ever
Great! Great! Great!
Amazed !! Only Entertainer
I love that Ranveer did the &quot;waray jaoon&quot; pose for Dips. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23toosweet">#TooSweet</a>

That&#39;s my favorite kind of love ....God bless them both.
deepika padukoon is the most luckiest woman in the world.

Every man shud learn from him how to love their wives he s damn good he loves her madly
Ranveer 💕💕💕💕
Noticed from the ‘back’ ????? Thats exactly what Hardik Pandeya said, and we stood up for it strongly. What happens to us when it comes to actors? Its sad. Really very sad.
aise hawas ki tarah kyun bol rha hai? <br>specially when he said gharelu
Please please please someone make a movie with Deepika and ranveer soon
Dat &quot;Haaye nazar na laage meri baby ko&quot; Uff.... I love this man..   Deepika is damn lucky...
I bet Deepika , was not doing the dutiful Nahi drama in general. Home maker comes naturally to women. But they are moulded to waste time on mundane things after marriage.
Ranveer and deepika your both are so lucky that you met each other and i love both of you so soo sooooo much i think ranveer apse itna pyar krte h jitna koyi nhi kar skta he is so nice person
I&#39;m really obsessed with his way of talking
God his manhood is not at all at stake for being called RSP. Boys look good when in love😉
awwweee.. u r succchhh a sweetheart 😍😍😍😍😘😘😜😜😜😜😜
Bet ranbir Kapoor is watching and regretting it
Can&#39;t help falling in love with him over and over again♥️♥️. How maturedly he dealt with the question about Ranbir Kapoor!!!!!! His ways have also changed upto a huge extent... Shaadi ke baad achanak kaafi bada ho gya hai ladka😍..<br>PS- That &quot;Nazar na laag jaay meri baby ko&quot; was literally an AWW moment♥️♥️♥️♥️ <br>I&#39;m so happy that after a really ugly phase of heartbreak, Deepika has finally found the ultimate definition of &quot;peace&quot; and  &quot;happiness&quot;.....<br>Deepika ma&#39;am, &quot;Kissi Shayar ki Ghazal ; Jo De Ruh Ko Sukun Ke Pal...;  Koi  Apko...Yun Mila Hai...Jaisse Banjaare Ko Ghar...🎵🎵🎵&quot; ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
there was one day she always get hurt by ranbir and now look at her she became most lucky girl in this world
Deepika is such a lucky girl ..  she must proud on you.. the way he praising her is melting my heart 😭😭
Ranveeeerr....Man of Entertainment ...!!! Love u so much...!! Stay Happpiee DeeppVeeerr...!!!!

Ranveer the next icon of indian cinema....
