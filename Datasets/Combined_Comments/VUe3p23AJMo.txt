Heart touched movie
📱⌚️<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hello<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>📱👂
Kaha mily ge yy movie
While watching this movie, I realised that even if cloth is in good condition, needle is theirs&#39; and thread is also for them to fix something for them
Very very nice movie<br>5 star movie

A motivation for the people who are lost in life, Nobody believes in them and are being called loser to change their life!
Movie so motivation and super movie
It&#39;s sad that in capitalistic societies,  we only seem to appreciate entrepreneurs who run companies that provide value to shareholders. Entrepreneurs like these who run small businesses and provide value to their customers often don&#39;t get as much visibility. They are just as (if not more) important to the economy. Their stories should be celebrated too! I haven&#39;t seen this film yet but I came to watch the trailer because I was suddenly reminded of it, hope to watch it soon!
Trailer me puri picture hi dukh di 😂
Are bhai badhiyan film hai❤
Anushka ne kaise is movie me acting kr li bahut ajeeb hai
Pehle October,fir bdlapur or ab ye sui daga, <br>Jesi super hit movie ko flop krva ke log bolte hai Varun Dhawan bdiya acting nhi krte.....<br>Hippicracy...
Oscar level acting by Anushka Sharma 😂

Mauji and Mamta, forever our perfect characters! 🥺💕
Now THIS is the Varun we love! 🥺💗
I like this Varun
Though, bollywood is all about &#39;happy endings&#39;; but atleast they tried some &#39;truth&#39; via this movie. <br>The picture of &#39;real bharat&#39; - &quot;ab jindagi ki cycle par toh maarna padega pedal; chahe mile ya na mile medal&quot;.( As we are alive, we have to suffer hardships and overcome them).
Share, this best movie of India, so everybody can watch !
Me ap ki bht bri fan hu acting ki nhi nature ki i love it plz ap esi movie mt bnaye mujhy nhi pasand ap amir hi achy lgty ho
No😂 Varun dhawan didn&#39;t fail as an actor We failed as an audience!<br>Bitter truth.

Watched the movie a number of times. Awesome work by Anushka and Varun. Praise from Pakistan!
Amazing movie..
What has happened to Bollywood
After watching video,I got goosebumps.
90%: praising varun<br>10%: praising varun and anushka<br>I say she deserves wayyy more....film sirf hero ki nahi hoti...it belongs to the both of them
Hello

Superb. Although I didn’t understand the whole language but some, the story &amp; acting was amazing. Varun &amp; Anoshka rocked. The fighters like him and her are everywhere so chances should be given to them. Amazing

I loved this movie... I don&#39;t know why it couldn&#39;t work in box office... Then same audience asks content kahan hai... Anushka n varun r just lit awesome movie 😊😊😊

I became fan of varun after watching this movie
One of the best movies !!
Hats Off really very good art presented by all the artists , this movie shows the actual ground story of a common man .
The best ever performance varun &amp; anushka both.
🙏
Wow dope 3 min was equivalent to 3 hours damn good
Gjb
Where Badlapur and October are highly appreciated, people barely talk about this movie. This one is also great like the other two movies. Varun should improve his choice for movies and should do more movies like these. His acting is good, but choices for movies are bad.
Plz upload full movie...
Wow am from Guatemala... And I want see this picture...! Saludos a todos mis amigos de India... Son increíbles
Any school and college students here 🥰🥰🥰
I think rather than blaming Varun , we should blame ourselves as well. We didn&#39;t appreciate him for october, Sui dhaga but criticised him for coolie no. 1 and kalank.  He deserved criticism for coolie no. 1 and kalank but he also deserved appreciation for October and sui dhaga.
Really varun&#39;s acting in this movie was totally impressive.Dont know why he chooses all those outdated remakes. Should focus more on acting oriented movies. He truly have a great potential.
Anushka was amazing in the film.....very versatile actress
We live in a country where such nice movies like &#39;October&#39; and &#39;Sui Dhaga&#39; struggle at the box office and so Varun Dhawan has to choose scrap and remake films like &#39;Coolie No. 1&#39;  and &#39;Judwaa 2&#39;. And bang! The same audience, who don&#39;t show interest in watching &#39;October&#39; or &#39;Sui Dhaga&#39;, make the theatres housefull when those scrap films are released.
Superb 👌🏻

The journey of two imperfect singles<br>But a prefect couple ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Only film of Varun I like.
Danny dengzongpa, Varun dhawan , ShahRukh khan, john abraham, Amrish puri and Paresh Rawal has no any self Respect. I analysis them this is all Actors who are ready to become the dog for their movies.<br>Why ?? <br>Have they dont Feel humiliation and insults for doing this ?? <br>If any one kiddnaped and threats to kills me and threat me that if i dont act like the dog so he Would be killed me so then i would be kill but never do this. Because i have too much self respect. <br><br>Now i am 20 years old when i was 13 years old so my one friends request me that i Give him to his shoes but i deny this...
Varun sir you don&#39;t have any self Respect. <br>If someone threat to kill me and blackmailed me that if I don&#39;t act like dog so he killed me but I referred to honour die instead live disgrace life. <br>But every person have different nature and mindset.  Every person have different personality , thoughts and Psychology.
Best amazing movie 💐💐💐

Awesome film yaar💖💖Great work..isko kehte hai film lakin aj kal film mai tw sirf nudity or vulgarity hi dikhai jati hai...Asay concepts hone chaye jo is film mai hai js se koi sikh milay.
MD.Anowar Hossen
Also ...... Just think about how many slaps Varun had to tolerate during the shoot of this, Humpty Sharma ki dulhania and Badrinath ki dulhania...etc............
I just love Anushka and Varun!!
I really really feel so sorry for Varun Dhawan...... recently watched the movie and he literally had to act like a dog...no offense but srsly why this role!! Also you guys should have seen Anushkas expression when that scene was there! Always the funniest scene on earth!!
Love you VD
SUI - DHAGA : MAD IN INDIA 😎😎😀😀🔥🔥
Varun bro all the best ❤️👍
Only Anushka can suit this role perfectly <br>This character is made for her <br>She perform very well in every movie and she do not act but lives in every role
Mamta you stole my heart
2years sab badiya he
This is what everyone wants from Varun dhawan 🔥😎😍🔥❣️
Love you Varun
Congratulations for 2 years of Sui Dhaaga - Made In India
❤️❤️❤️😆😆😆
where r those people who said that he dont know acting...plz pehle movie dheko bad mai kuch bolo
hypocricy if it&#39;s made in china no one buy it now or atleast in india
Varun is a good actor. He should choose this type of films. Many says that he is very over acting. Yeah he does over acting in comic roles. Comic roles doesn&#39;t suit him. His character in Badlapur was awesome. Now Mauji too😍.

इस फिल्म की जितनी तारीफ़ की जाये उतनी ही कम है| वरुण धवन जी और अनुशिका की एक्टिंग बहुत ही बहतरीन है| बहुत अच्छी फिल्म|
I don&#39;t know why people say Varun Is overrated I don&#39;t feel like it he is a good talented and very hardworking just because he come from flimy  background or does movies like abcd or judwa 2 that&#39;s does not mean that he is overrated people need to understand this is his work and he has to do all types of roles not just serious roles but also this types of roles also.anyways he is a great actor and people who called him overrated are jealous of him he has proved himself by badlapur sui dhaga October and many more flims that he is a good actor and he is❤️so please don&#39;t say anything to anyone without knowing.

Although Varun is an amazing dancer and comic, he should definitely do more movies like this. He has it in him to do this type of emotional acting. I cried while watching this movie tbh.

Sui dhaga hit
Supar Bhai Varun Filmfare awards Mila he Bhai KO super hit
Best  acting in this movie anusha Or varun
Movie is showing intense Hard work done by mauji and mamta... Very nice movie I must say... And best movie of anushka and varun...
Very nice movie...very good chemistry... Lovely concept... 💟💟💟💟💟
I swear this is the best role played by Varun ever. No flaw here. Proud of him. This film has proven his mettle.
I never thought Varun and Anushka will look that good together. So what if I ship Anushka with Virat &amp; Ranveer, and Varun with Parineeti &amp; Ileana. They nailed it in this movie. And kudos to the make-up artist to make them look good together.
Nice movie varun<br>It shows struggle of life
Varun dhavan acting was good, but not so much perfect.....I only think rajkumar rao for this kind of movies
This movie is outstanding,  A1 movie 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Good movie

Awesome Realistic Stories Of Central Indian Societies. Hats Off You, Author &amp; Writer To recreate the Seen In your Writing...
why the role of anuska keeps crying so much for everything. At least she can say some of emotional dialogues without crying like chimps. i dont thing some of dialogues were so emotional dat she need to cry. I feel the way she kept crying looks awful but still nice movie, great acting with great actor n actress apart from anushka kept crying for every normal things. If they kept anushka as more strong lady as she was already very clever in movie it would be great. Apart from that great movie. Anushka, Varun and all the actor great. Hit
Sab badiya hae💚
I&#39;m really glad that Varun finally took on a serious acting role!  <br>Anushka is incredible as always
Zabardast movie 😂 with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mamta">#mamta</a> memes

Varun Dhawan&#39;s 2nd nice movie after Badlapur
आज तक किसी भी फिल्म को देखकर इस तरह जज़्बाती नही हुआ, इस फिल्म ने तो दिल और दिमाग़ को हिला कर रख दिया,यहाँ पर आकर कमेंट कर रहा हूँ तो लग रहा है जैसे मौजी और ममता को शुक्रिया बोल रहा हूँ इतनी शिक्षाप्रद कहानी को जीवंत रूप में दिखाने के लिए।                             &quot;💐बांकी सब बढ़िया है💐&quot;

Good sang
If you make memes of anushka then you insult poor people anushka just role played in this film , the film screen the real fact of garib aadmi and uski faimly
anushka acting 2.38
Walked out after an hour.  The mother admonishes her husband who&#39;s crying over a soap operat:  &quot;Don&#39;t watch those if you can&#39;t handle the emotions.  You will have a heart attack or sick.&quot;  Well guess what?  This movie is just that.  An emotional roller coaster that I didn&#39;t need.<br>I was expecting to see someone build a garment factory one sewing machine at a time.  Nope.   Also, there is no way he could have made 30 nightgowns that had a lot of detail and appliques, etc. overnight after he went out of town on a bicycle, to get in line to take a sewing test and win a sewing machine and carry it back on his bicycle.  So that was too implausible.<br>The crowning moment was when the mother was in the hospital with a heart attack and her giggling, everything is a joke, other son shows up acting goofy.  <br>I was outta there.  Let me know what you think if you are able to sit through it.
kisne kisne sui me dhaaga dala hai
Who said VARUN didn&#39;t know abut acting!<br><br>Hit like for Varun&#39;s acting
My favourite Hero Varun Dhawan

Watched this movie twice in theatre😊Osm movie🎥
Very nice  movies
Saui  dhaga  movie I watch today evening, was very touching!!!!  In real life hardly such successes happen.  In order for India to progress jobs employment should be in abundance and pay rate should be higher.  Aameen.  This way middle class and lower middle class don’t take shit from business owners.  I take lot of shit at work and from employees in USA.  Our country India should be better so we could all successes and not have to leave our own country for better life. Inshallah.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23respect">#RESPECT</a>.  Aameen.
I love var un acting. But these tailer       was super
I am known as the Anushka Sharma ki Deewani on Fb bcz i have posted sooooo many memes of Anushka Sharma XD
Ab actor aur director log line pe aagaye motivation movies bana suru kardiya ab acha lag raha he
Ek number movies
great  varun
great  varun
No plastic faces with make ups!<br>No hero fighting with 10 gangsters!<br>No feministic non sense!<br>No cheap ass comedies!<br>No petty politics!<br><br>A warm hearted movie showing everyday life of ups and downs of an ambitious hardworking couple. Simplicity is it&#39;s beauty.
Very interesting movie yar💗💖💕
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUe3p23AJMo&amp;t=103">1:43</a>  That epic moment which went viral globally :) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUe3p23AJMo&amp;t=147">2:27</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUe3p23AJMo&amp;t=158">2:38</a>. Love to see such realistic inspiring movies.
Great movie.....superb content......great performance by varun n anushka...........depicts true reality ...............a ray of hope that our country would shine if we all make sincere efforts in our respective fields...

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUe3p23AJMo&amp;t=159">2:39</a>😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUe3p23AJMo&amp;t=103">1:43</a> who came too see this ??
It is a very good movie, today i saw. I am overwhelmed by the simplicity and humble acting as well as portrayal of middle class people of India finding it difficult to earn livelihood and the film gives a message to every youth how to MAKE IN INDIA is possible.  Anushka is the dream girl of the film
ye sweater kyun pahan rakha hai?abhi toh tempreature 35 degree tak rahta hai.
