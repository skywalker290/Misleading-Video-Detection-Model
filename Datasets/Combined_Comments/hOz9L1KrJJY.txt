If the writers wanted to, Jesse can still be alive…. just saying
I genuinely got chills rewatching this scene.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=18">0:18</a> Dominic Toretto Was Very Cross
THE WORLD DANGEROUS CASE IN THE WORLD :AMERICA 3/4 GONE ,GERMANY HALF GONE ,SOUTH KOREA BOILING POINT .NORWAY SHUTDOWN CHINA :😓
That&#39;s the last we saw Jesse, and we will never see him again. 😔 (And neither Leon; who was &quot;missing in action&quot; after the first movie for some reason.)
Hahah this is why democrats think the way they do lol two 30 round 9mm Mack 10 how many rounds was that lol 😂 and two 9mm suppress don’t sound like that lol hell the Jetta was a Honda civic in race wars
Brian: Where&#39;s Leon and Letty?<br>Dom: They&#39;re long gone!<br><br><br>Me: Where&#39;s Shadow and E-123 Omega <br>Sega: They&#39;re long gone!
I&#39;m Not Running! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=18">0:18</a>
Legendary scene and movie, betrayal and the complication of two sides
Miss Paul 😭 RIP
R.I.P. Jessie. The only one of the original crew to NOT come back from the head.

Technically we never saw jessie actually die, we just assume. They should bring him, vince and Leon back for the last movie
Остынь Уокер
I would just like to say its scenes like this one that are the reason they are still making these movies
RIP Paul Walker
Vin diesel’s walk and the music lookin like a model
Jesse&#39;s not dead. In the future they&#39;re gonna find out Ramsey&#39;s not the only person who made God&#39;s Eye. It was also Jesse, who went off grid and made God&#39;s Eye to track Dom.
How they bring han back from getting blown up ,but can&#39;t survive jesse and Leon
Jessie man
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=17">0:17</a> actually really startled me. I’m so used the meme of him talking in a quiet growl that this was shocking.
Sheesh, recent Fast and Furious movies brings some characters back from the dead. Hope to see Jesse again XD
I am sorry Paul  walker 😢 😔 ❤❤❤
Can&#39;t wait for Jesse to return to the franchise as a cyborg riding on a flying dinosaur.
Jesse from breaking bad
Damn cant believe leon never even made a cameo in any of the 9 films after this one.
When are they going to revive him back? You know, with all the dead people rising again in latter fast and furious movies.
Why didn’t Dom throw the house at them?
Pokud  netrefí můžeš mířit ty .
Nikdy nemir na přítele pokud víš , že tvůj přítel.
Still waiting for Jessie to magically come back
Jessie will come back in number 11 as the criminal mastermind who was pulling the strings all along
That&#39;s the real &quot;toretto&quot;)👍
Rest in paradise to that beautiful Jetta
When Vin Diesel knew how to act
Jessie forsure is coming back in Fast X part 2, I&#39;m calling it
Poor kid
we will find out jessie is alive in fast 11
So jessie coming back in like Fast 11?
Someone said the next villain for 11 is going to be Jesse’s dad. After the death of his son he’s going to get revenge on dom and his family.
Jesse will be back in fast 12
My only thought was if u seen the bike coming why aint you yell everybody get down now
c’était mieux avant
I swear I’ll never watch another Fast &amp; Furious movie if they bring Jesse back from the dead lmao
👨🏼‍⚕️🌬🔥
Jessie the only one too stay dead
first time iv seen blood in the franchise
I miss Vin, they killed him off for no reason.
When he dodged all those bullets we should have known something dumb was to come and 22yrs later fast x
Hope Jesse returns at some point seems as tho his death was never confirmed, the actor is also very vocal about hoping to return. We need an O’G back before the franchise ends
went from this to going to space and racing submarine on ice...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=18">0:18</a>
Somehow even Jesse survived
I&#39;m surprised they haven&#39;t brought Jesse back from beath.
This Dom &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
fast and forius 4
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=72">1:12</a>  &quot;My family senses are tingling!  Something&#39;s wrong!&quot;
Honestly, for the last two they should just bring everyone back. Jesse, Leon, Vince, Suki, Fuentes, Owen, Mr Nobody, Johnny Tran. It’s obvious now that there are no real stakes, death means nothing, characters just come back. It could be Dante and every previous villain vs every other F&amp;F character, just go batshit crazy.
I miss the days when Dom spoke like a normal person.
i want to see them bring back Jesse in fast 11, or if they do a fast 12.
Yeah remember every time see it does give me goodspond
Pvt Caparzo lost his family
RIP jesse &quot;sadly dead&quot; 😢
Now that was a good movie
RIP Jesse
Kete film e shof edhe gjith diten, nuk me merzit eshte bukur kur kujton nje artisti filmi american ,e the 😞🙈🖐

Paul bagdad bag recollection initial
Back when Dom actually spoke. Now he growls and mumbles like he&#39;s had a stroke a few minutes before the filming
I always liked how real the first movie was. No crazy car backflips and 007 stunts, just believable stuff. Even the train scene at the end was realistic af and it was done with no cgi.
Why are those Asian Guys on the Bikes Acting Like Black People ?
Oh yeah, back when Supras were cheap and Dom didn&#39;t gave a gut...
Iiwieiii2ii2i2ree2e2e wjsujeueuuewuu  rjjwiqii13i1i3i1i31 kke2i..........kk2kk2e23k2k424kekr3ko42o32o32oqu1u1u3uu3uj232iri2i4i2i4ikkkiiwiqii1i3ii1i3i33233ii32443444
I would have hit one of them squints. Zero chance they both ride away alive. And hey after I get a free bike!
If this scene happened today dom would’ve jumped in front of him and caught every single bullet
Dead in this movie, villain in the next movie..
I love how its supposed to be super dramatic of Brian rushing home, and he’s just going barely the speed limit, until he decideds to throw it sideways a little for the effect lol.
They don&#39;t make movies like this anymore.
Lol I&#39;m 11 years ago
This is how the new ones should be done with new people and about cars but also have vin diesel pop up on some scenes, like for example the kids that lived across the streets from doms house saw and heard the torreto family legend name and now theres a new batch of crews hitting licks for parts on trains and semis in california, imitating doms crew in the first movie and you can have the dominic torreto character pop up and show this kids right from wrong, but keep it about cars, no extra action bullshit, we need more street cars and races and alsp good music to it, theres so much to but think about for scenes when it comes to this idea but thats just a lil but of what the movie would be about i feel like its a great movie plot for a fresh fast and furious movie compared to what we’re currently getting, the rock and vin diesel are trying to just out do eacchother with the stunts, we need good songs to go with race scenes and just race not action bullshit
The Rooftop Koreans are now on bikes 👀
The first one was the best👍 I remember watching it at the theatres back in 01,  back when F&amp;F was about stealing DVDs VCRs  stealing cars and illegal street racing, now the rest are like Marvel Super Heroes coming together to save the world from corrupted leaders....
I really didn&#39;t mean to I&#39;m sorry they are always making things so Flippin hard for me to live
What if Fast &amp; Furious and Triple X were secretly connected? While Brian went to Miami, Dom was suddenly brainwashed into another identity to do covert missions. After a few years, Dom gets his memory back, looks for Letty and finds her in the Dominican Republic that leads to the 4th film.
I miss when dom spoke like an actual person
Movie 1 and 4 are the only truly good ones, 2 fast 2 furious was funny, but i wouldn&#39;t call it good, 3 was terrible, and the rest are just pure cheese
Jesse gets shot a couple times=dead,Han gets blown up in a car after being tboned going 100+=alive
Hes probably gonna return for fast 10 or fast 11 solar drift 🤣🤣😁
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=18">0:18</a>
Poor Jessie he was so young.
Jesse wasnt a made guy.
TBH F&amp;F 1 had the biggest heart of all movies that came after it (7 being 2nd) I miss the days when Vin Diesel acted like this.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=79">1:19</a> dom salto como gato xd
I forgot it had a drive by seen in the original movie.
Michael Stevenson&#39;s Drive car Nissan Altima chase by the Coleman&#39;s henchmen ( Michael Anthony Stevenson) in San Jose California Carmen Sandiego&#39;s outside ( Gina Rodriguez)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=78">1:18</a> makes this scene unrealistic. No way that hyped up ADHD dude doesn&#39;t dive behind some protection the moment he sees 2 bikes coming up the road. Good movie tho.
To Movieclips, you have a few spellings and space errors in your closed captions, and also has one bad word that you need to censor, the B.S. word. Can you fix your closed captions for me, please?
The only FF I like
The score for the chase scene is absolutely 🔥 🔥
There faces at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=73">1:13</a> is just such a good scene, in real life if you see death coming at you im sure that’s how your face would look just like doms and Brian’s
おい
IM NOT RUNNING!!!!!!
Jessie comes back too life in the 10th movie
My favorite part❤🤣🤣🤣
Brian was spooked..
Scary dom when screams I&#39;m not running
I think jessi was stupid in this scence
OG
Never understood why Brian didn&#39;t start shooting at the bikers earlier...
let&#39;s be real here, this is the only good film in the franchise and every movie after the first is the equivalent of what Schumacher did to Batman<br>i&#39;ll only watch them up to Tokyo Drift because of the tuner cars... maybe the fourth one as well... maybe
Why is none talking about Jesse&#39;s  death by Tran
Nooooooo jesee

You watch, they are going to resurrect Jesse for the 10th film
💕💕💕💕
Normal day in America be like
2022 here
Toretto treated his fellas like family and that&#39;s one quality which always gets me.
I can’t believe I met Chad lindberg at Fuel fest
It haunts me how jesse just stood there like an idiot for the whole time while dom came bear walking halfway across the yard,
I like this version of Dom so much more than the version we have today
You should of stayed in the car Jessie
jesse will never be forgotton
&quot;No more running!&quot;
First movie and Tokyo Drift were my favorite.
The subtitles for this video are just… You turn them on ok? Trust me.
Dom got some sharp spidey senses
Anyone here after F9?
Tab off the soda can to fix the hose it worked.  Familia.  ❤️
Man this movie makes me vomit from my eyes. 😂 The greatness..
Dam Jesse pissed some people off at the car wash
f.b.i. plaque n.plate
This was powerful Dom would of killed a cop or snitch in his instead he loved Brian he knew he wasn&#39;t a cop but wanted him understand this fed life not for you your one of us

When fast and furious was about cars and racing
For the LONGEST time I always wondered why tf Jesse didn&#39;t take cover, but when I realized he had ADD (which he claimed to have in an earlier scene) I understood why🤷🤷🤷
Suspenseful

Most satisfying moment in the movie😂
If Han can live and letty why can’t Jessie 😢😢
One of the 00’s movie i would watch and enjoy
Jesse, Vince, Johnny Tran, Elena, Gisele will all be resurrected by Eteon in FX! FX needs a new Brian O’Connor and this new person is Matt Damon! Brian O’Connor will be back via CGI/digital/standins is going to be with Caleb Walker and Cody Walker! Cody Walker will have a new character as Brian’s long-lost brother Little O’Connor!
Never turn your back on family
Came here for I&#39;M NOT RUNNING!!
I miss this movie, I get that they switched up the formula to appeal to wider audience and be more family friendly (studios are after-all, in the business of making money) but damn.. this movie became an instant cult-classic, for better or for worse. I remember the combined release of TF&amp;TF and Need for Speed Underground little more than a year led to the car tuner / racing scene becoming wildly popular in the 2000s. They had to tone down the street racing aspect after the connection was made between dramatic spikes in street-racing related deaths following the release of subsequent Fast &amp; Furious street racing movies / Need for Speed games, but I still miss those times. There were a lot of cringeworthy ricers driving around in the early 2000s but some people managed to build some really unique looking aftermarket performance cars. That wasn&#39;t really a thing outside Southern California and Japan before TF&amp;TF came out, only old school muscle cars and drag racing in most places.
A hit and run

I love those movies, Jess shouldn&#39;t have died, he should have been with Dominic until the end as the best friend as well as Brian, in English it has a completely different atmosphere

Did Jesse die
Beautiful sweet heart 😘😍😎😎
for me this FF is the best for me , it brings nostalgia in a way , love this movie ❤️
What the hell was that all about!😐
Best
Why’s Dom going left? Bikes took off to the right…
The look on doms face when he saw the bikes lol
💔💔💔😭😭😭😭
I still love dom and family in ff film its not trick scene, but the next ff many scene trick to over power of dominic
This is actually my favourite scene in this entire movie for some reason lol
THIS MOVIE NEEDS A SEQUEL!!!!!!!!!
Man that techno music gets me hyped every time I hear it 🤣
And people say fast and furious was about racing 🤣 it&#39;s about cars, guns and heist.
Dom put the gun down now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=9">0:09</a>
This movie was so kino
Dom is already running and ducking for cover by the time they started shooting and Jessie is just standing there like a dope.
Dom:    Know why I didn&#39;t get shot? <br><br>Brian:    Plot armor? <br><br>Dom:      Cos I got family
Still the best movie out of all them
Very interesting🤔
I am always with you❤
He was not saying all this &quot;cuh&quot; stuff before 2 fast 2 furious
Dom shouldnt have put that gun down.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=82">1:22</a> wtf is this 4 limb running.
TBH I wish Jesse lived
These movies man !!....I don&#39;t know what make them so special and irreplaceable
RICKYYYYY!!!!
F10: Bring back Jesse from the dead
“JESSE!”😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
lol get rekt
Cool
Back when characters could actually die. Now they survive even after getting shot by missiles, dropped from multiple stories high, getting their cars crushed with them inside, go into space in a junkyard car, getting shot at by multiple shooters point blank, and the list goes on. Characters now get killed (Letty, Han) and come back to life!
FAMILY?

For me the best fast and the furious! This movie has an incredible essence different from the rest fast and furious, that became super unrealistic and fanciful
Doesn&#39;t the guy who got shot post on TikTok?
A man once sayed: BALLAS....drive-by....incoming !
Stan Marsh: Oh my God! They killed Jesse!
How come this movie received negative reviews?

How do u hold character yelling at your best friend! That’s hard not to laugh 😂
Still  waiting for Jesse to come back as an Alien Cyborg  on FF25
Its not even the same film series anymore
Now they in space I think it’s pretty sick
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=18">0:18</a> when your parents sign you up for cross country
he’s still alive because of family
Before Dom became a super hero and spoke in only low growls
damn never knew jessie is resurected and bec ome john cena
That overacting tho <br><br><b>I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SORRY</b> <br><b>IM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SCARED RIGHT NOW</b>
Back when F&amp;F wasn&#39;t about being the Avengers and was actually about street racing and grounded and realistic
before CGI and it turning into mission impossible
Cyborg Jesse will be the main villain in Fast and Furious 10
family
I walk by this film location all the time, live just around the corner
He didn’t survive cause there wasn’t enough <b>FAMILY</b>
I can&#39;t believe this movie is 20 years old already 🙃
Diesel killed Walker
then they went to space
Came a long way from this to flying cars. Lmao.
I can’t believe it’s been 20 years since the fast furious saga came to be
Back when Vin Diesel actually acted.
Paul Walker, I still miss you ♥️🙏
The one time Dom&#39;s white t-shirt is actually dirty
I’ve never watched the first one
I even forgot that Dom had emotions lol. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Vin&#39;s fault cause he has range as we can see here. But the latter movies just make him act like a dumb superhero one emotion all the way
20 years ago... Times fly
Oh no. Dom lost his family..
Paul walker looks nice with long hair and vin diesel looks nice with a fit body. If he still had a fit body, then those unnecessary actions scenes the new ridiculous movies have would look a little realistic.
Movies nowadays miss style.
Man when that tune hits <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=104">1:44</a>

I see the algorithm has found out about the Family memes.
F&amp;F 11, Jesse survived and resurfaces. Leon makes a comeback too. That would be too cool. Hans return was nice, Jesse and Leon&#39;s return would be the cherries on top,lol.
and to think 8 movies later they take a car to space
What did jessie do?
He’ll probably come back alive supposedly mr nobody is around there
Jesse in the fast and the furious reminds me of mouse from the matrix
In the 10th movie they will resurrect Jesse using Jumper cables, calling it.
Here before the meme exploded
Am I the only one that actually didn&#39;t care that they killed jess....he was kinda weak
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=78">1:18</a> dom big jump
A guess.. F10 starring jesse!! He is alive for the plot xD
No cgi in this seen 👌 makes it that more authentic.
This is such a great movie
Still one of the best. Back when everything was grounded
Johnny and Lance came thru an spint the block lmao
Fast and Furious 100=Jesse comes back alive
Jesse might of lived, if someone said “Get Down.”
Leon just disappeared never mentioned again
First of the Beta Male Franchise 😂
Back when the fast and the furious actually had good acting and no excessive stunts
Jesse was a damn idiot. &quot;Oh here comes guys with automatic weapons shooting at me, everyone else is ducking and diving let me just stand here maybe they won&#39;t see me&quot;
Please explain why brian got in trouble for letting dom go? Think about it just as Brian said he didn’t call the cops… doms cover at that point wasn’t blown. I mean he was at home so if the police thought he was the one doing the truck job why didn’t they come for him already… I guess you could say because Vince got hurt and was at the scene and Vince is doms friend but that wouldn’t hold up on a court of law as long as Vince said dom had nothing to do with it
Life&#39;s been good to Vin😀
FF movies are so stupid. <br>Bikers pass by, Dom and Brian have enough time to dodge bullets and evade for cover all the meanwhile Jessie stands there like an idiot for 30 seconds until he gets shot …
Man good movie , the prime of the series.
They straight ripped off Menace II Society.
Back in the day before they were cartoon characters and could defy physics.
Damn
Maybe, all they wanted to do is shoot up the Jetta.
2021 I&#39;m NOT RUNNING!
This is a Meme
Why did it have to be Jesse he was my favourite
Back when Vin Diesel could still play a believable character
this one is still my favorite I hated Jessie got killed I liked him  then you see the code dom lives by where family and loyalty are the most important things and that you ride for family
jesse shouldve had a red shirt on
RIP amazing angel i love you paul
Back when FYF used to be about racing, now whe have star wars meets avengers.
When their cars couldn’t fly
Jessie deserved it. A man does not run and hide.<br>If the situation was reversed, then Dom and Brian would have done the exact same thing for their car, respect, and money.
Back when the actors were trying and the movies had stakes smh
Awesome movie clip
At this point toretto is perfectly able to save jesse just picking up the time machine that his long lost genius grandfather build to try to stop hitler
Guy remember ,<br><br>When Assassins creed was about Assassins and their creed<br>While<br>Fast n Furious was about Being Fast and Furious in Racing...<br><br><br>Those were the days 👁️👄👁️
family
Vins acting in this is probably the best I&#39;ve seen from him
This was the best! The second was good too. Then the franchise just went too improbable chasing the next dollar that I lost interest.
Are any of these movies good?<br>I haven&#39;t seen any.
Can’t wait for them to bring Jesse back to life in fast and furious 11
And now they jump off their cars from planes. Fight tanks and submarines.
This was before they had SUPER POWERS 🤣

I just noticed Jesse was so scared and freaking out real bad that he didn&#39;t even notice Brian pointing a gun at Dom. He didn&#39;t deserve to go out the way he did...
R.I.P. Paul s<br>he Was so a good Actor an a greatfull  man 😢
Just trying ti figure out how in the world did this movie turn into a GTA Online game in the future with the jets and flying cars SMH
They did Jesse like 2pac
Jesse has the nicest car imo
Donnie take pictures of Elijah behind eight glass cabinet full of guns were held hostage in a while Texas an apartment in mineral Wells Texas in apartment 502 Shady Hill Circle Donnie new Shelly surroundings he was human trafficking kids in the 80s they were taking dope

I personally think that where F&amp;F went wrong is definitely the fact that they didn’t stay true to what F&amp;F stands for and was supposed to be. Maybe making so many movies wasn’t a good idea because they’re basically milking it at this point. F&amp;F was never suppose to be about saving the world, it was about street racing. Which is a more realistic and interesting concept anyway. The colour scheme was one of the things that disappointed me the most about the newer F&amp;F films. The cars in the first three movies are in various different colours making it more aesthetically pleasing and adding to the street racing concept. Their clothing was better as well. In the new movies not only are they getting old now but the main character/ actor Paul is not around anymore. So I think it should’ve at least stopped at furious 7. I feel like if they wanted to make more movies they would need to bring back the original concept, better colour scheme and probably a new young cast.
Man Vin’s physic was the best here
God bless y’all! The Lord is always by your side no matter what!!!
I miss the grounded story of these movies
I like this film so much
I was crying
Back when Dom actually showcased severe emotion unlike the robot he is now with his witty vague responses
Kicks the hell outta the new ones . Love this movie
Everything is changes , include movies, actors, actress, ages.
R.I.p poul walker  he died in a car accident Rest In Peace poul and roger
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I feel like any normal person would duck down and run when they get shot at, but guess that’s what creates a plot for what happened
If you Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins then Resurrected three days later and is our Lord and Savior you will be saved ! He who is sinless died on the cross for our sins just so we could be here. He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords from generation to generation! Read your bible daily and Repent!! God bless you and your family!💜 (Not trying to force upon anyone who does not agree ) Have a blessed day!🙂
Geeez look how young they looked, hahahah    this is my dads favorite of all the past ones...... cause it was just more real, not wayyyyy over the top as they get sometimes with the  CGI and  stunts, and  crazyness...

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=78">1:18</a> why does dom look like a cat who got scared shitless lol

These movies suck.
Best scene ever.
So they can kill off Jesse. Which who was only shot twice. But can bring back Letty and Han? Which who were both blown up. That doesn’t make any sense.
I love fast and furious
I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 20 years ago that this movie came out along with Harry Potter, Lord of the rings, and Cat and dog.
This scene is better than FF 2-8
What happened to beans? I forgot what happened
This is why you can&#39;t have an argument on the streets anything can happen to you
R.I.P Jessie

Alright
Damn Dom looks so young here
Jesse could have simply ducked. He would still be alive
<b>Dom senses are tingling.</b>
its last words were i dont :  know what im doing
Rip Paul Walker
In Fast 10 Jesse will be alive tho
Fast and the furious went from this to advanced warfare
Jesse would’ve lived if he was stuck in the moment and would’ve ducked out the way
Acting on point
How the hell did all of those bullets miss Brian when they first started shooting?
Rip Paul
i don&#39;t care what anyone says every fast and furious was a banger
Even tho brian was a cop he was always one of them
He died as he lived, awkwardly...

I hope he makes a return in the future. Hopefully when they land on the moon. It would be a plot twist where he is resurrected as half human half cyborg

Why did Jesse die so fast and it was not even the 5th episode and he DIED
If only they kept this kind of vibe for the rest of the series.

Uzi Variant name?
Why vin was so good on the first film and now he&#39;s just always mumbling ?
R.I.P. Paul Walker (1973-2013)
The times when Dom wasn&#39;t robot😌
LOVE the acting in this scene!!!!!!!
Tom move your car Brian bullshit <br><br>What he say is bullshit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=105">1:45</a> why does Dom look like Donkey Kong
I had the worst dream a couple of weeks ago. I was on a plane going somewhere and I was sitting by Paul to keep him safe, I wasn’t going to let him die again. On my way back home I was on the plane and forgot to sit by him. As it’s taking off I said “wait, no I have to sit with Paul!” The plane was vertical and people were in the way. I pushed my way through and did everything I could. “Paul, I can’t lose you. I can’t let you die again” is what I said. He smiled at me like he was saying “see you soon” or saying goodbye for the last time. I kept fighting to get to him but I couldn’t on time and I couldn’t save him, I was so mad at myself when I woke up. The worst dream ever
went from this to fighting superheros, what happened
Dom reaction time: 🐆🐆🐆 💨 <br><br>Jessie reaction time: 🦥 🦥 🦥
All you had to do was hand over the car Jessie
Toyota
It is still the best movie even though Paul died
17
Shoots a million bullets there way and of course the “heroes” of the story all survive just fine lol 😆.
Little did dom knew that this franchise would die in a much more miserable fashion
That&#39;s a ride-by shooting
When F&amp;F was good and didn&#39;t have BALONEY PHYSICS.
The original and the best movie
To była fajna cześć  <br>To były czasy
2 fast 2 furious is the most underrated one
what kind of acting is this .. even i can make this
am I the only one who noticed how crap the subtitles were? Literally said plates instead of police multiple times
I can’t look at this with out choking up this was such a good movie and I miss seeing Paul walker in thes movies 😔
these movies are literally like cutscenes from the older GTA games
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=83">1:23</a> how he ran like a dog tho im dead
Shooting them would be easier then them shooting on a highspeed motorbike, very unrealistic...
Seems like a lifetime ago!
Don‘t worry Jesse, you gonna become an even bigger role in a great TV Show!
The best Fast and furious and 20 years old... Wow!!!

Rest İn Peace Paul Walker..

YouTube is just I’m time to remind me that this movie is now 20 years old
Am I the only one who thinks the 1st film is the best
Imagine if Jessie was alive.. Would the franchise be different
Looks like dom has spider senses
They shot him for some reason
Oi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=52">0:52</a> I need Jessie’s Jetta
To be honest.. I was happy when Jessie died... I didn’t like his character
They bourght Han back pls Jesse
Lol he fvked up<br>He bet a fvkin pink slip and yet he ran away
Thanks for your terms and conditions
9 years later, if you&#39;re watching this you&#39;re a legend.
those motherfucks
They went from this to hobbs and shaw...
It would be crazy if Jesse survived and he&#39;s in f9
And the award for best comedy goes to... The fast and the furious
Back when bullets killed people.
This was good back when this was more about the really lose fiction of a more realistic crime world. Next stop, Dom vs. intergalactic terrorist. Wait, that&#39;s just Guardians of the Galaxy. We already peaked.
That&#39;s what he gets for not paying up
Did jessee died or didn&#39;t?
He deserved it for driving that sh** car lol.
The og crew was the best crew
Song?
you missed me, Paul Walker! : &#39;(
I wish they could use like custom cars
Rip paul
RIP Paul Walker
YOUR A COP
♥️🤗♥️

Vin Diesel.<br>Holding a shotgun.<br>Next to a  black supercharged Dodge Charger.<br>Doesn&#39;t get more badass than that.
I WATCH PAUL WALKER THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS MOVIES 🎥💜
why are the fast and furious antagonists always foreigners?
You know Dom has a special place in Jessie‘s heart when he goes and tells him what was he thinking in such a big brother way
In 2021 jessy Return in fast furious 9 😆 🤣
Paul walker will never be forgotten
Bullet accidentally hits Brian or Torrey in the dome... boom movie over
F&amp;F Before Nick Fury.
Y Jess was so afraid... still don&#39;t know
Exactly get the real bad guys
So Dom and Brian took cover, but Jesse just stood there like a deer caught in head lights.
God dude <b>THIS MOVIE IS STILL SO GOOD!!</b> like wtf 🥵🔥🔥🔥
I wish I had a main character script to protect me from bullets just like Brian and dom had.
That&#39;s what 2000 hp looks like. Between both of those

I love how deep Dom’s voice is
Many F&amp;F films later, and you got The Rock jumping from the highest platform and perfectly landed on a moving vehicle.<br><br>I mean seeing this scene in the first film transits from that moment to driving on ice against a nuclear sub before the gang uses their car as a shield to save Dom from a fiery explosion.

I thiught my kind didnt do drive byes

Just a random joke:<br><br>Teacher: today we are going to Bangkok<br>Kid named Kok: ...
This franchise really deviated from what made it interesting. Now it’s just a typical action franchise. Look at how animated Vin’s acting is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=29">0:29</a>. You don’t see that amount of intensity or commitment in his later Dom performances.
And to this day Dom is still running.
Its funny they had all the time in the world to hijack that truck but all of a sudden remembered Jesse could be in trouble lol
Fast 1, 4 and 5 are the best imo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=17">00:17</a>
Lol 😝
Lmao worst franchise ever
This is a movie that I watched almost 100 times and it always hits deep watching it. Great memories and missing Paul walker.
jeez, the acting in this scene is just... Awesome. Especially considering that this film was Paul and Vin&#39;s beginning in acting.

When the F&amp;F movies were actually good and not a complete joke like now...
What ever happened to Leon?
waaaaaatch yo back<br>watcho watcho back<br>watcho watcho watcho back
And that&#39;s what happens if you lose for pink slips
They went from this to chasing the Tadakhul lol

Can someone explain why dom triple pumps the shot gun?
Bit harsh to kill someone because they dillydallied with ponying up their car after a race....
When physics still exists
Damn my Jesse Jetta
Oh my god
HE GOT SHOT! LMFAO!
Jessy... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
I wasn&#39;t even born yet when this movie came out
This scene is realistics as this does happen in LA
Rip paul 😥😭
Those two were sorta even at that point threatening each other like that.
Theres no way tran sent those chinese/Japanese/yakuza I dont know there just bad humans that killed jesse on dirt bikes with their smg&#39;s
i don’t get it<br>how did the bikers know someone was gonna be standing on front if the house. why drive-by shoot a house?..
Today you need to explode an entire continent to kill anyone from the crew.
Now UOU see

Miss the days when Dom speaks clearly.
When fast furious was cool and just the movie about vehicle enthusiasts
That never made sense to me. You’ve got witnesses and motivation. He might as well just drive to the police station next and turn himself in.
Here&#39;s a scene a little reminiscent of New Jack City which came out 10 no years before this.
tien youtube cua paul . 0.15% cho co con gai &#39; cua paul
Bryan voice changed 😂😂😂😂
He should have avoided the bullets in slow motion.
back when Vin Diesel wasnt some superhuman bullshit
Only this part and i can say that this crew was the best man!!! Paul😭😢
There&#39;s no way Dom would have a brother that he never mentions
RIP Jesse, his first and last movie of f&amp;f
Poor jesse such an innocent pure hearted good boy
Long time ago<br>Before they had super powers<br>Fighting abilities<br>Saving the world😂😂😂🤣<br>Death defying stunts and un-beleivable <br>Skills knowledge about sub marine high tech knowledge 007 bond type stuff.<br>Jumping off buildings flying in the air. Saving lety on a bridge in mid air. Omg. They really went too far🤣🤣😂😂😂<br>Please GOD.  TELL THEM TO STOP MAKING THESE HORRIBLE MOVIES.<br>NEXT THEY WILL BE RACING IN OUTER SPACE AND FIGHT ALONG SIDE THE AVENGERS VS. THE ALIENS
Should have stopped at the first one  or took their time with follow ups of this movie
The fast and the furious ( 2001 ) - drive - by shooting scene ( 8/10 )| movie clip
# amg
how did we go from street racing to blowing up the universe next door.
I felt so bad that Jesse got Killed and that we never found out what happened to Leon after this Movie. No mention of him ever since !!!
Cmon coulda saw that coming a mile away.
When this film was actually related to street racing unlike the others
F&amp;F 11 trailer - JESSE IS ALIVE
Don&#39;t worry, Jesse will be resurrected in F&amp;F 38. Right?
I love how everybody else had plenty of time to duck and cover while jesse was just standing there staring at the sky.
Still wanna know what happened to Leon after fast 1, he was one of the best things about the movie.
You know, i feel Brian couldve like, opened fire BEFORE these dudes got there.  He had the gun primed and ready
All of these movies suck. But this one sucked the least

R.I.P Jesse and Paul Walker
I’m in love with that 1970s charger &amp; the blower on it
If jesse died,then what happened to leon after after fnf1?
First movie is my favorite
Back when Vin deasel actually shouted in the movies
I have a mad respect for all the details in all of fast and furious... Im not a fast and furious fan, but i&#39;ve been watching these movies while growing up and seeing the house from the fast and the furious explode in fast and furious 7 made me realise all this stuff mann... you know.. first I didn&#39;t even realise that It was Brian from the first film to all the way to 7. I have been watching these movies in a wrong order but I get the stuff.. yeah ik not the best comment, but I tried to explain my mad respect.👏😔✌
<b>M O V E    Y O U R    C A R.</b>
Shut
See this was back then when this movie was more realistic in terms of action. Now we&#39;re full DC mode
one of the most powerful scenes in this film, this movie was about brotherhood, friendship and loyalty, period
I hope Jessie is still alive like Han
This guy will return is fast 12
มันคือmy mate nate
Whey put so much heart in this movie!!

Hehe

This scene will always be legendary.
It makes sense that Dom helped Brian not cause Jessie died but because Johnny and Lance shot up his house.
You can tell when dom says BRYAN I GOTTA FIND JESSE BEFORE THEY DO that he loves him as a brother.    He uses his first name
dominic: JESS!! &gt;:O<br><br><br><br>What wereyou thinking, man? :/
Doms dad must&#39;ve been a badass dude for his son to be the way he is. Crawling to his dude while bullets are flying through the air

I like this movie nice car

If you think fast and furious has gone too far nahhhhh this movie is just 2000s while the action fast are 2010s 2000s and 2010s movie give you a different feels.
I think its like a hondas two thousand

If that happened in FF8, Tourette would&#39;ve just deflected the bullets with his hands and family got this bikes blown up to hell.
R.I.P Paul legend we will never forget like if with me 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I swear I can’t tell if vin diesel/ Dom is cuter when he was young or cuter when he was older but he is fiiiinnnneeee and plus why is his voice so deep and mysterious like I swear he should be nominated for sexiest man of the year!!🤣😂🥰😍😘☺️🥴🥴🤤🤤

See why Jesse can&#39;t return in f9
Man Paul and Vin&#39;s acting in this is so strong, you can hear the emotions running through their voice. Especially Paul&#39;s
What did they do to that Supra????
BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD  FAST AND FURIOUS ALL COLLECTION OF MOVIES
Wish the series stayed raw &amp; real
When Vin Diesel could actually act 😂

😱👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
ah yeah... Back when Dom had emotions
Evrybody complain about how  fast and furious was about racing cars in  street an runing from the popo and now  have cars flying like indiana jones and ciborg soldiers  but remember folks you always have to start with tony stark walking out of a terrorist camp to ironman fighting a purple alien warlord  who want to retrieve magic stones in the purpose of whiping out half the univers,  all in a planet called titan so nothing is wrong for here lol
Johny Tran is the greatest ever antagonist in the history of hollywood, right up there with vader,thanos,joker!
If you can bring back Han, How come Jessie can’t come back ?
When a character of the main group can die and never return again
Dom: Let me just throw a loaded shotgun in the ground real quick.
“You’re a cop!” is basically this film’s version of “You’re a wizard, Harry!”.<br>I mean, The Fast &amp; The Furious did come out the same year as the Sorcerer’s Stone, I think.
I always wished hes character survived
IT DOESN&#39;T MAKE SENSE LOGICALLY HOW JESSE WAS THE ONLY 1 WHO GOT HIR BY THOSE BULLETS
I love you Paul like teacher 🙏🏼
Back then when Torettos voice was normal
<b>sees them coming a block away</b><br><br><b>*does nothing until Jesse is dead*</b>
Fast 10 the return of Jesse
I see death of jesse han s face
Hell if they can bring han back from a car explosion, I&#39;m sure they can bring Jesse back
Jesse isn’t dead the actor is teasing fast 9 on his insta
So the three of them had ultra instinct in the first movie.
I hope León comes back in the last movie of the series. Since hasn’t been around.
Jessy the only character not to come back from the dead. 🤔
Now he would jump over, take one of their guns and mow them all down while picking up a car and killling the last one by slamming it onto him.
Gg
The first movie is cult classic than the rest 💯👍👍
How tf did dom not get shot
They need to mention Leon for fast and furious 9
Jesse needs to return! I know he’s dead, but if they can bring Letty and Deckard Shaw back from the dead, they can bring Jesse back too!
A stupid guy let Jesse died only because he didn&#39;t listen and Jessie to bend down but he didn&#39;t poor Jessie but did you see that there was a man was crawling like a spider Wicked in it it this is the baddest movie I will watch it all over over and over and over
What’s this song called anyone know?

Gotta love how dom runs to Jessie
Why the hell didn’t Jesse duck

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=72">1:12</a> it was at this moment where dom revealed his superhuman abilities
Criminal life will always lead to this,   death,  misery,  dispair and sadness.
When that kid pulled up wasn’t he curious as to why those two guys were pointing guns at each other?! <br><br>Like, hey what’s ahhh what’s going on you guys?
Anyone can tell me what&#39;s the bgm from Brian start chase them <br>I Searched for 4 years
2019 ?? <br>☝
This movie is a blatant rip-off of ‘Point Break’.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=83">1:23</a> Dom runs like my dog when I say it’s dinner time
😍😍😍
So much respect 😍<br>This scene is more emotional than the drag race.
the 1st two movies were amazing after that it really went downhill
If only the rock was in Jesse&#39;s place there we would have never been introduced to the worst FF character ever.
Dom, put your gun down now!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=46">0:46</a> i don&#39;t understand Mia she tells Dom to stop it ? Brian&#39;s pointing the gun at Dom plus she&#39;s his sister and she doesn&#39;t take his side ?
Dang I felt bad for the kid
If ecwcftewv2:2&#39;uirif
But did he die tho??????
What happened to Leon
Balla’s drive by in-coming
Where&#39;s Leon and Letty?!<br><br>Letty will be back in Fast 4!  Leon, idk man maybe Fast 9 or 10!
This scene makes literally no sense.<br><br>So Johnny Tran, who&#39;s son of a dude (probably a mobster) with tons of cash. Risks life in jail, by personally killing some kid for not delivering his car (yet), which he could easily buy in the snap of a finger.<br><br>Even if this was about Dom banging his sister......really?!?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=77">1:17</a> When the Ice Cream Truck drives fast and past by you .

All Jess had to do was dive behind his car bro lmao 😂
Jesse is the only one who is partially concealed by cover during the drive by, and is the only one who is actually hit by the hail of bullets
still waiting on what happened to Leon
First movie is easily the best. 5 was dumb fun but the series becomes a cartoon after
Worst cop ever
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=30">0:30</a>When you play cops and robbers with your cousins and they dont wanna be cops
Funny thing: Jessie was the only one with the solid cover.
18 years of this
<b>You are the Cop. You’re a Cop!!!</b><br><br>For some reason, I love that line
Paul Walker here was a bit better than the other F&amp;F films
I love this scene so much apart from Jessie getting shot. Xxxx
Nobody knows this movie make more hit parts hereafter..
What always stood out for me in this scene was what a cool looking shotgun Dom&#39;s holding.
What is jessie scared about?
Vin Diesel&#39;s acting is so much better in this one.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=18">0:18</a> When it&#39;s one minute left in PE class but the teacher wants you to do another sprint

Whatever happened to Leon anyway anyone know??
I can’t believe it’s been 18 years. Just a reminder that we’re getting old.
So everyone keeps wondering where the &quot;family&quot; aspect came from, huh? This was it.
That shotgun didn’t go off when he just threw it on the ground like that?
The rock just filmed his first movie.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=72">1:12</a> Thats so Raven
Dom feels different in this movie I , this movie best of should’ve ended at fast 5 <br>6-8 ruined the franchise
Movie cool.

18 years strong
Drive by shooting menace to 2 society
From this to dodging heat-seaking missiles, blasting off EMPs and disabling nuclear submarines.
Brian saw the eyes that’s why he ran
I thiught we already dis this
Mia is annoying
Handaaa two thouaaasaaahnd
GOD DAMN THAT GUY HAS STORMTROOPER AIM
just saying.. the first movie was an amazing movieeeeee.. nowadays, would make easily 800M ..
Wow look at that young Vin Diesel
Move your car
This is is one of my favorite scenes of the entire series for some reason. Their chemistry here is great.

Best
If the series had stayed this way, just typical street racing/heists... it would’ve done so much better. Waste of potential😴 still my favorite movie lmao
For the last time it was never about racing it was always action and drama love etc
I guess Bryan couldn&#39;t have returned fire a little earlier 🙄
Ever noticed how jessie just keeps talking while brain had the gun pointed at dom lol

dde
miss the old movies
DDE
Whos here from dde?
Jesse is alive he&#39;s on dde latest vlog right now...
As soon as they heard the motorcycle coming in they start popping off rounds those guns that they were holding those were Uzis 9 mm little mini guns they&#39;re kind of like a little handguns but there really are a pack of hell of a punch when Jesse saw them coming he should have gone down on his knees right behind his car he would have been fine right there the moves right up front but nope he stands right there in panic
Jesse could&#39;ve just ducked behind his car.
If vin diesel did thanos voice
IN GEDENKEN AN IHN IMMER NOCH FOR EVER WALKA  IN LOVE WE ALL
From this to superhuman strength
Why toretto acting good in the first fast and furious and now his acting is bad?
When fast and furious was actually about cars
Dom so cute
Rip Paul
What fast and furious that was??? and i miss Paul so much😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️
i’m here in 2019
What if they did a recreation of the beginning as a throwback on the fate of the furious so Brian could make dom snap out of it
I love how in 2001 it was just one movie then over the years it became a huge franchise
My gosh vin disel voice deep
Should bring jessie back
I dident know asians can do drive bys like that
I LOVE this scene!!!!!!
Wow 7 years and now it’s in my recommended
Jesse&#39;s been dead for about 18 years now.<br><br>Since he was murdered by Tran in 2001.
I&#39;m sure Dom remembers Jesse.
In real life they all would have been dead they dumb trash at shooting
Brian hold his M9 really weird

Jesse is such a wimp tho
Rip  paul walker
I think I was more devastated by Meadow&#39;s reaction to her dad&#39;s death. It really put me in tears seeing her crying about it. Sometimes I&#39;m not scared to show my emotions and sometimes I am. I was sad to hear about Paul Walker&#39;s death, but more sad about his daughter&#39;s reaction.
I love how the shotgun is made of stainless steel.
Rip paul walker
I know when I saw Dom going right after Brian I was don’t do it Dom! Don’t do it!! But he went Force 10 From Navarone on Lance! And Brian the same on Johnny
Whos here because of the meme?
So you&#39;re telling me in that 5 seconds they noticed the bikes no one shouted get down?
So they committed a drive by murder because they didnt get a car in time....while destroying the car they were supposed to get in the process. And I thought asians were smart lol

Every scene in this movie was so beautifully directed. It&#39;s amazing how beautifully this movie has aged over time. It&#39;ll go down in history as a classic.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz9L1KrJJY&amp;t=65">1:05</a> ooooo Dom threw a loaded gun !😲😂🤦🏾‍♂️
Let&#39;s not make this death forget that Hector is gonna be running three Honda Civics with spoon engines. And he went into Harry&#39;s and he ordered three T66 Turbos, with NOS, and a MoTec system exhaust
The original crew MUST return
THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE. <br>2001 FILM &quot;THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS&quot;

Which part is this
Had this happened in the new FF films, Dom would&#39;ve chased down the bikers on foot, fly 30 feet crossbody to knock down both motorcyclists and knock both of them out with one single punch as their heads will explode like a watermelon.
