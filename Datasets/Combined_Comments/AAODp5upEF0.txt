Pewds: this one you can actually tell what it is, it’s toy story!<br>Me: tries to think of what it could possibly be

Yui
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh
He&#39;s look like a twins from everibody love Raymond in the age of 4
drawing the eyes popping out like that is actually pretty creative! i haven&#39;t seen any kid (or adult for that matter, which probably makes sense lol) draw eyes like that before

How does he remember all this xD ahahahh
Felix should remake his first comic
But where is the old PP captured on Nokia?
Me as a sweed too / that spell is like my old spells<br>Also me: WTF
Thanks for the story, I just had an anxiety attack but the worm story combined with the calm music managed to make me sleepy and now I can sleep well despite my world burning like forest fire. Again, thanks Pewds, I bet you&#39;re going to be a great father with banger bed time stories to tell your kids before sleep, good night 🙏🏼

He looked like a blonde bruce lee in his teen years 😂 damn.

That spelling was horrible jesus
His childhood comic book is actually a great children’s book idea, I’ve never heard of the reverse animal eating thing, 10/10 very creative 👌🏼
He will didn&#39;t know he will be the King of the Internet and the creator of Brofist

Hey Felix,<br>I am a librarian from the Gothenburg library. I hope you return the disk soon and also best wishes.<br>Yours sincerely,<br>Nick Gur<br>Gothenburg, Sweden
Well apparently, some of the Vikings ate the amanita muscaria and then peed in other Vikings&#39; mouths and that digested mushroom was what truly hyped them up for battle. Don&#39;t ask me how they discovered it.
I really like this photo because the belt is in between my legs -felix 2020
I can actually kinda understand this bc I&#39;m Danish lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=328">5:28</a> OMG MY NAME IN A PEWDS VIDEO
Yo, I know your channel wasn&#39;t as big as now, but I first saw ur vids in 2012 and I&#39;m from the Philippines! That is youtube success worthy of the newspaper lol

Felix’s drawings look like they are from a Jack Stauber animation

does anyone notice that felix looks like the older brother in good luck Charlie(pj)
Hello january pewds i am a youtube time traveler in april right your swedish hair was murdered by your future self
I saw his spelling and I’m like damn he doesn’t know how to spell and then I remembered English is not his first language
“I was such a bad speller”<br><br>Me: mmm ya it’s just random letters because I can’t speak sveden person language
He was a great drawer back then <br>(No a fence I&#39;m joking)
The comic sounds like hundred years old folklore stuff
Watching this with poppy eyes 😢😟
That moose was pretty good.
It&#39;s called a bowl cut Felix
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=658">10:58</a> Felix looks like the kid from home alone
The JetSki is literally sitting on dry sand
skloo
&quot;Who&#39;s that handsome devil?&quot;<br>IT&#39;S THE KAZOO KID
Swedish school food is actually not bad
I think he is translating everything wrong<br>- A MESSAGE BY THE SWEDISH GANG
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=570">9:30</a> Thought someone was next to me talking to my ear

Felix: that’s how you draw a car when your a kid <br><br><br>Me: I just draw cardboard boxes with wheels on
If you’ve lived in Partille you better at least pronounce it right // someone from Partille
Felix:I was a pot-head<br>Americans:PEWDIEPIE SMOKED WEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
Bruh he we was predicting the future. He caught a dolphin in minecraft.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=393">6:33</a> I learned that too but it was in an anime called vinland saga
i loved this
Felix: reads childrens book<br><br>Felix: copies book format but adds his own details so he does not get caught copying the book<br><br>Fan: i hate u
In the start of the video Felix was reading some of the things he wrote down when he was younger and I could actually understand some of it before he translated it to English because I’m from a Denmark and Swedish and Danish have words that are actually really close to being the same😂
Child pewds kinda looked like maxmoefoe
This video is so so so underrated😔
ngl, the story about the worm, is pretty good.
LOL!😂😂POT HEAD!do you ever wonder pot head,
Sick pothead
YOUNG FELIX SO CUTE AAAA😭💗
Bowl cut
Me seeing Felix writing in Swedish: Wtf?
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=583">9:43</a>, it says SVEN on the bottom of the cup.<br>Illuminati confirmed
Who tf is Mishel anjelo
Pot haircut? You mean....... a BOWL cut?
What came out first the chicken or the egg? <br>The chicken came out the worm...
lol i have the spikehead pic with colors
T .series beat u👎👎👎🇮🇳
i like how he calls a bowl cut a pot head
Felix&#39;s American counterpart is for sure Jason Dolley, at least during his high school phase 😭
Mi vida 😭💜
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=71">1:11</a> cuz Brad stole it lol
Yeap. That&#39;s how I figured he would look as a child. That&#39;s why he looks like that now.
that story was the cutest thing ever😂
best comic ever!
Я тут одна русская?
How come every time i come back to pewds channel, i see myself get unsubscribed?!!! I sub it every time, its been a while now so annoying, anyone else have this isse? 😪
This is too HD for me
I have a similar hedgehog toy. Three of them in fact. I bought them for my doggos to play with.
Bruh in third grade pewds looked like an off brand bts member
Felix: I think I should get the spiky hair back.<br>Also Felix two months later: shaves hair short...<br><br>なに@(・●・)@
Imagine that girl now a women terrified after seeing that helix wore that costume without underwear xD probably hating that she chucked it away tho lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=391">6:31</a> Totally a Minecraft Dungeons reference

The mushrooms from midsommar 😭
That story was actually somewhat decent and creative for a kid
Есть кто нибудь Русский

Should have Thai language <br>Fc Thailand🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🥰

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=304">05:04</a> he wrote &quot;slut&quot;. Felix you naughty boy

Felix with spiked hair looks like a bully from a dcom
Eminem wants to know your location
Lol wasn’t there a video to go with the newspaper article? I remember seeing a video with someone interviewing you and you were wearing that outfit. I’ve been watching your videos for a long time..
The date on the toy story bit will be 24 years old tomorrow (or today in sweden i guess)... it&#39;s older than me by about 2 weeks 😂😂😂
PewDiePie should make a video where he reviews Sweden candy and he uses pp points to right then
I dont think the media hates him I just think that they&#39;ll make more money exposing someone who has influenced millions of children who are also the leaders of the next generation.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=596">9:56</a> why does that look like my dad when he was a kid lmao
Please can someone tell me the name of the song at the end? I’ve been asking for it since 2016 or something 😭
Felix we have the same drawing style
Omg that story was actually really good
I love this video sooo funny<br>Btw you looked really cute❤-❤

Cool
Seeing old newspapers ;-; AAH MEMORIES
Wow baby and teen Felix was adorable
&quot;I&#39;m going to expose myself!&quot; - Pewdiepie 2020
Meo ovo
he called himself a pothead. but he doesnt know what it means.
I never knew Pewdiepie wrote Inception.
the poster brought back serious nostalgia :&#39;(
I&#39;m Finnish so we have to learn Swedish and my Swedish level is literally at the same as fetus pewds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=391">6:31</a> a Vinland Saga reference!? 😂

Pewdiepie with spikes=Leonardo DiCaprio from the movie the beach
Ah the memories

dehär e så kul att titta på som svensk xD
420k  for you Felix🤙
Everytime he said pothead, I was dying
The worm game is the best game i’ve ever played when i was at young age.
The story of the worm made me laugh harder than I should&#39;ve....😂
I like how the word for end is slut
You&#39;re like Sam Winchester. <br>He was changing style all the time. :D<br>Why so much suka blyad :D :D
I thought that with this video I will realise when felix losed his legs
LOL WE CALL THAT A POTTY HAIRCUT IN FINNISH and the mushrooms are &quot;kärpässieni&quot; = fly (the bug) mushroom. 😹😹 I always wondered why there&#39;s no emoji for that mushroom. I guess they don&#39;t have them everywhere then.
Pewdiepie EXPOSED by Pewdiepie, the video.
Okay but why did you draw genitals on people as a kid
I came here because I heard this person had the most popular channel on Youtube.  I am now leaving mystified as to how and why that could possibly happen.
I recreate your worm story but its a snail

Small pewds looks like the kid from home alone...

My fave videos of pewdiepie is him telling Childhood stories! Its so funny!
We called that haircut you said was pot head a &quot;bowl cut&quot; in the US. You looked like PJ on Good Luck Charlie when you were in high school. This is entertaining. You should do more of these types of videos. Lol! 😂😂😂
little Felix ate Bengt!!!
My favourite TMNT was Michael Angelo as well!
You&#39;re childhood photos are adorable

Everyone else: bowl cut<br>Felix: p o t h e a d

Bring back the spikes.
You look like Shaggy on your college years
The entire video was pretty funny but I completely fucking lost it at the transition from the media portrayal of his success story to his spike haircut lmao
Michelle Obama is also my favourite ninja turtle
felix as a child looked like the kid form home alone
Being Swedish and seeing his spelling is the best
that Swedish spelling doe
&quot;This Book Loves Pewdiepie:in Tiny Print&quot; on amazon. Support the merch that promotes the pewd! TRUE BROS UNITE FOR THE MERCH!
Felix: What color is skin color?<br>Media: Pewdiepie is racist
Irony.<br>Bunch of 9 years old talking about decades!!

Never realized how much Felix looked like PJ from Good Luck Charlie

Wow me and pewdiepie both were blonde as children and now just have weird brown hair fun
Felix has the best story i ever heard &quot;Bing Bang Bong&quot;
His adolescent picture looked like Isak Valtersen from Skam
Those red and white spotted mushrooms are poisonous agaric fly mushrooms. They&#39;re highly poisonous and will cause complications if eaten.<br>We love you Felix.<br>Don&#39;t do it
Pewdiepie: &quot;They robbed my house in japan*<br><br>Also PewDiePie: <b>I lost my mic that&#39;s why i&#39;m holding other mic, SOMEONE STOLE IT</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=31">0:31</a> Go Go Power PP
Felix: “Sick pot-head<br>Also Felix: “I don’t do drugs”
pewdiepie&#39;s tv in the background is the same as mine
Michaelangelo: <b>Exists</b><br>Felix: <b>Michelle</b> angelo.
I have the same T.V as pewds
Felix: &quot;...I&#39;m going to expose myself.&quot;<br><br>FBI: &quot;FBI, OPEN UP!&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=382">6:22</a> pewds wants the shrooms

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=290">4:50</a>, I don’t think Felix knows how meanful that story could be and how genius that was. “Comical genius” he stated
“Nice shade of skin color”<br>-Pewdiepie
Is it just me, or do I see the word slut when he finishes the “Worm” comic on the full moose page
OHMYGOD Pewds was drawing in &#39;95 that is the year I was born, freaky!
When you’ve already seen all his photos because he posted a video exactly like this a few years ago
I&#39;m swedish and being able to understand his &quot;stories&quot; he wrote as a child is awesome
Havät
How much did he like tennis? 😂
Writing exciting as x t c <br>Xtc? Pewds been rolling from a long time ;)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=666">11:06</a> XD that was funny
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=297">4:57</a><br>Read the last word.

So basically, Felix made a hentai of himself?
Smh <br><br>pOtHeAd <br><br>Its Bowl-cut. <br>Mk
do the roar lookin man
Idk but I&#39;ll eat bebeh Felix
Teen Felix can gladly break my heart
When a black person asks you to let them borrow the skin color crayon<br>You are presented with a universal decision. <br>If you pass the white(peach or apricot colored) crayon, you will look racist<br>If you pass the black crayon, you will look racist<br>The power move that will get you out of it the situation AND make both laugh is to give the person, who wants the crayon, a light purple crayon.

Who wants minecraft furniture for tuber simulator WHO IS WITH ME
Imagine if everyone unsubscribed...
I cant read pewdiepie comic

this warms my heart
michelle angelo tho
How dare you<br><br><br><br><br> you destroyed my childhood
Pewdiepie: I finally hit puberty at age 29,30<br>Late bloomers:wait,hold up
Dislike 👎 HAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAH 😤😤😤😤
this is my favorite video of yours by far, very fun, and wholesome
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=540">9:00</a> looking like maxmoefoe
Tiny Pewdiepie looks like a combination of Macaulay Culkin and Jacob Tremblay
Get rid of the moose and I actually like how the worm&#39;s role was reversed.

We call it a &quot;bowl&quot; hair cut, boomer 🙄
damn this man makes me happy
Felix: says epic.<br>Captions: <b>a pig</b>
Felix you were so cute!!!
That comic so sad. I felt it
Hahaha, skrattade högt till din quote i Partille tidning 😂
Felix called his younger self a p o t  h e a d
His first 2020 video
Felix: Stop finding my old photos!<br>Also Felix: <b>*Shares a bunch of old photos for people to find*</b> xD
Var i Partille bodde du?
I know I’m late, but i think at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=134">2:14</a> he thinks his mom told them to set the table, but i think she said that they should take a shower. The picture he made is of him showering!
Honestly, sometimes Felix sounds like a swedish version of Jim Carreys grinch
SICK POTHEAD
Beautiful comic book
Pewdiepie wanting to eat 🍄 makes me instantly think of Bjorn
Pewdiepie talking about 🍄 and explaining that Vikings used to eat them to get amped up makes me realize how many cultural depictions of Vikings in Vinland Saga were accurate.
Felix was such a weird kid. 😂😂
His old story’s probably inspired his Minecraft series
This guy knows what&#39;s business
Piewdiepie you pro men
I got my stories.
That worm story looks like poopdie from your game.
I’m sorry but I laughed way to hard at this 😂
Terraria.
Elon musk need the blueprint of that cyber truck

Thank you for the photos! Such a freakin cutie!! And you grew up to be such a handsome man. Lucky Marzia!!!
Did you ever think that young Felix look alike Sam from Supernatural
Pot cut  bowl cut
Aw little pewdiepie would never have guessed that 5 million people would be listening to his comic book 20 something years later!!!!!
Kinda look like Bryce Harper in this video idk why
We call that the legendary bowl haircut here in the states😛

Caaaalvoooo
When Felix was reading his writings, my dumbass did did not realize that he was translating what he said. I was like &quot;where does it say that?&quot; Looking for the English version of his writings i- I did not realize it was in a different language
And so the decade ends...<br>~☆♕

Bring back pot haircut
“jokes on you, i’m going to expose myself”<br>mood
In Canada the haircut is called a bowl cut or technically a pot head.

Lmao, this made me laugh. It reminds me when I found my Kindergarden drawing books, and it would tell us to draw something, or a letter, or to write #&#39;s 1-10. Omg it&#39;s hilarious the shit I was thinking back then.

Can we appreciate the fact that once Pewds hit a certain age he just stopped aging?

WhaAt PEWDS HAS A SISTER? Since WhEn-<br>I jus figured it after this vid lol. wow haha | Proof: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=147">2:27</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAODp5upEF0&amp;t=162">2:42</a> and the likes.<br>Also Who else is watching this now? OwO<br>~Curious Internet Star from Discord☆♕
man i really just honestly enjoy watching these kinds of chill vids where pewds reminisces about things.<br><br><br>another thing is that i remember watching that specific video where pewds talked about being interviewed for the swedish newspaper for the very first time all those years ago.. felt really nostalgic and then felt kinda strange about how you can find articles about him like everywhere nowadays.<br>it was such a big deal back then, like an actual newspaper acknowledged a silly video-website and this particular guy making videos on there. most folks had never even heard of youtube at that time!
“Michelle-Angelo”
Felix: Here is me and my sister <br><br>Me: There is another

Hi
I TOLD YOU <br><br><b>Moose Ain&#39;t Vegetarian</b>
Pewds seems a bit out of practice reading the Swedish articles there... I would imagine after time it would fade some if you spoke and read nothing but English 98% of the time... and he knows Italian.
Felix is spying on his pat self with pictures and memories

Felix: What was I spelling?<br>Me: dude idk. It looks like chicken scratch. Plus I think it’s in a different language so that doesn’t help.
I wonder if you think of your old thoughts in English or Swedish. Do you remember them first as being Swedish, or does it come to you as English?

You are a very cute child, but in what country are you the prince? Well, it&#39;s an intelligent note, this child will surely become YOUUBER in 20 years. Please raise it carefully. At that time, I was the still young mediator who divulged the young couple. Did you remember? In fact, I was hungry in front of a long line of mediocre people lined up to see the &quot;Month Stone&quot; of the American Pavilion at the World Exposition held in 1970 in Osaka at a glance. My teacher taught me the secret art of a 10-year-old who was empty. He has since trained in the Himalayas and is no longer over 300 years old. Thanks to you, I&#39;m 60 and I&#39;m immersed in the ultimate bliss when it&#39;s time for me to finish my training journey and to share the knowledge I gained during this period. Hey, God.
