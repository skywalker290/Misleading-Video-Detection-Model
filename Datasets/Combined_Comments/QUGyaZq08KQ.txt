Talented actress who stole India&#39;s Dil
i was in year 7 when she received this award i was in tears when she was giving this speech as after HUM AP KA HAIN KON IN 1995 many of her movies didnt work and her critics use to write bull shit, and then in 1997 two movies came called MYRTUDAND AND DIL TU PAGAL HAI for which she got this award and that&#39;s where she dedicated this award to her critics. i use to pray for her success. as i had watched her movies, and i thought that she deserves a better and by the grace of Allah she got it through her hard work and compassion.
Oww madhuri🙈🥰
Ohh my god...... Like,the way she talks... Uhhh,......very impressive😍😍😍
ये पर्दा है जो नजर आते छा जाती है, दिल की धड़कन बढ़ती है तो अरमा की किताबें कह जाती है।। पाता साया देता छाया सकून काया ,अद्भुत माया।

Very nice romantic exciting movies...stunning.30+jeetender..

I love madhuri mam
Pata ni.. Madhuri ji ko dekh ke dil kuyn khush ho jata hain
She did not deserve an award for DTPH..a very mediocre performance that year. In fact Sridevi should have been awarded for Judaai for playing such a complex role with such panache in a terribly directed film. In fact if they would have awarded her for Mrityudand it would have made some sense. Anyway filmfare awards are very bias and their standards stooped down by the mid 90s. Dil, DTPH were very mediocre performances indeed.
Madhuri dixit she is the queen and a angel she smile so beautiful. U are a beauti.🌷🌷🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟👍
Dislike krne waley  bhain ky lory katrina karena  ky fan ho gy

Same lines......
When awards were mostly just awards, not social media-targeted, sponsor-happy  PR stunts featuring pretentious so-called stars and their edited, oh-so spontaneous reactions. <br><br><br>Hats off to this talented lady.
How did she overcome her pimples, acnes and lightened skin tone..??  want to know badly. ...  😻
What a slap on the face of brainless critics den and even today when they penned her down again by calling total dhamaal as stupid comedy and den the film went on to become one of the cult money spinner .. love you MD... More power to you
Happyyy Birthdayyyy to the Bollywood actress I love the most❤❤❤❤❤
