Welcome back Pablo Escobar💗
“Before, fun fact, he died of a gun shot wound to the head the day before I was born”<br>Welcome back, Pablo Escobar!
Downhill of unbox therapy started after this Escobar phone video.
The website is down lol
&quot;Some people think I&#39;m privileged cause i get free phones but i actually pay for every single one of them.... (Meaning in way more essentially privileged)&quot; <br>🤯🤯
😂😂😂😂
Why has no class action lawsuit been brought against these scumbags?
barcoesq
The most curious aspect of this is the idea that the Medellin Cartel, a Cartel so rich they spent millions  of dollars (millions) on rubber bands to roll their cash in, somehow didn&#39;t give enough to the leader&#39;s immediate family for them not to use his own mugshot pre-headshot wound or name to make a quick buck on somewhat scammy products. <br><br>Let&#39;s pretend he was the assassination CEO for a moment. Pablo must have really kept him out of the loop money wise.<br><br>Also, Hansen, come on, man. You gotta stop. I&#39;d say it&#39;s getting sad, but we&#39;re past that.
If Pablo came back alive and saw this shit he would unalive himself on the spot
If Pablo Escobar believed in reincarnation... welcome back, Señor
One of the video that made me stop watchng Unboxing scam channel. Thank you.
Can they just get away with not shipping the product? Aren&#39;t there laws against it?
Ok... But... Hear me out...<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Why are Chris Hansen/Anna Anka selling ads for 50-100 bucks?<br><br>Is someone going to tell me that they read the lines and did not realize it was an ad?
Using AI, it pieced together this with El Chapo. Can’t wait for the El Chapo Gold 15 Pro!
The fact Klarna thought it was a good idea offering their services to this was insane.
they literally just took samsung folding phones, changed the wallpaper and put a gold sticker on the back, it&#39;s crazy that this even got all that attention.
atleast its free shipping
Dec 1st: Escobar birthday<br>Dec 2nd: Escobar gets shot and dies<br>Dec 3rd: marques brownlee is born<br><br>Is marques brownlee Pablo Escobar reborn⁉️🤯🤯
You do realize you just funded a criminal organization, right?
Still waiting for mine, tracking says it crossed the border
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=501">8:21</a> WHAT?! hahaha
why does it say payment method Klarna?
😂😂😂They got them
The guy behind this is a Swede that tricked old people with dementia to sign their house to him in the and then he was jelous of swedens biggest youtuber and tried to buy a swedish website tricking pedophiles to meet them, just to try us think he was one by publishing this youtubers name on it. This man almost breaked this youtubers sanity even calling his neighbors telling them to not let their kids out. All of this is proved on youtube to be false when the owner of the site recorded the phonecall with him, he then followed/stalked the youtuber on his holliday in Spain the guys name is Olof K Gustavsson and this is just the tip of the iceberg!
Olof K Gustafsson is a stalker
the fold 2 page got wrecked now. hats off to who managed to do that.
can u contact me pablo pls
They should make a George Floyd phone 😂😂😂
however is behind this escobar firm it has a great sense of homour. you may laugh or cry but it is your call
Remember samsung isn&#39;t one company, they&#39;re mutiple like they make tanks, missiles, and fighter jet
What is this 18:9 shit man...
Marque just want to tell you that we don&#39;t have money to bail you out of those kidnappers 😂
what cover is that on your macbook?
Never hear about him till now
Where are you Escobar? Ready to go scam more. Worst scam
wts jag visste att Anna Anka hade en skruvlös, men att hon gör reklam för denna telefon tar sitt pris
I love Narcos Season 1 and 2
The fact that Marques just has money to spend like that 🫠
i know pablo escobar bc of the memes
How is it an upgrade when u never received the first one... They still owe you at least the Escobar 3 n that&#39;s probably an iPhone 13 pro Max
You can joke about anything. You just need the right delivery.<br>Except this escobar phone. They just never have a delivery.
I respect Marques and his honesty and integrity and his braveness but also his calmness and resilience he tells things like their meant to be told Its really sad that these fake people would treat not just Marques but also everyone else like crp <br>But also I respect Marques for having the blls to say do not buy either of them<br>I was wondering about Marques merch would the phone cases he has made be suitable for a note 8
They&#39;re trying to pressure Samsung by getting people mad. They want people to think &quot;Samsung is ripping us off!&quot; Then the Escobar douchebags will go to Samsung like &quot;if you want this to go away pay us money.&quot;
I think the craziest aspect of this whole story is that the ‘To Catch a Predator’ guy sold out to Pablo Escobar
Escobar: I&#39;m going to release the new Escobar<br>Samsung:No I&#39;m going to sue you<br>Marques: HAH scammer <br>Escobar:nooooo
I knew Escobar is scamming company and It&#39;s like The Connections in RE7 &quot;F***in&#39; Company&quot;. Your review help everyone to avoid scams.<br><br>I hope the Police &amp; the US Government successfully takes down Escobar!
Someone explain to me how this is legal!!? Taking money and not sniping the product
That is the normal income you make the money easy so you will lose them easy
let&#39;s pay a bunch of rich drug lords for a reskinned phone...
Why didn&#39;t you ask you money back from Fold 1?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=1">00:01</a>
Atleast you still saved 1050 dollars by getting the actual phone
This is number 1 bullshit.<br>- Escobar Phone <br>- Kahbib Nurmagomedov
Pablo Escobar died day before mkbhd was born, now he he fighting against Escobar family/company.<br>So AMAZING.

MKBHD is kinda boring compared to Mrwhosetheboss, possibly because he has less background music.
This is a pretty frigging brilliant scam though, pretend to be related to some O.G., buy a couple domains, pay some half naked chick&#39;s to mess around, buy a skin from dbrand and slap it on a phone and then have a bunch of trash sellouts advertise your scam on YouTube 🤣
“Chief of assassinations” 🧐😳🧐
But I can see the Escobar phone fold phone having a bad condition. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=388">6:28</a>
They are fack company
This. This is comedy.
Who the hell says, gold color looks good on a phone??? Even if Iphone would bring gold products, I wont ever buy anything like that, let alone EscoProd.
Marques, I hope you&#39;ve distance yourself from that CROOK Unbox Therapy. He&#39;s a dishonest salesman.
So it&#39;s a scam trying to look legit
You made $1,100 profit.
pablo escobar is my hero
I love how a tech YouTuber somehow has much more integrity than the pedo catcher.<br><br>How Hansen has fallen, the man is pushing scams for scraps.
What the actual fuck?
What knife is that? May I ask?
Dayum
2022
Pablo Escobar was like &quot;Marques, you take it from here&quot;
Probably a heist that got them plenty of those galaxy folds then they decided to rebrand it as their own phone. and since nobody would dare travel to their company&#39;s doorstep it&#39;s safe for them to scam plenty of people. they maybe got 5-10k of those phones and probably sold fictional 100k&#39;s of them = ez money.
It&#39;s money laundering. They are hoping that the phones will become quite collectable as they aren&#39;t delivering many, Now.
Marquees wants ALL the smoke
but i wanted the golden sticker<br>:(
im waiting to buy the adolf hitler phone made in germany
If Unbiasness had a face
Marques, we love your honesty and objectivity, good job!  America is full of reasonable white people who support blacks and anyone else who is honest and hardworking, although it&#39;s hard to see that today.
If ur smart put in Linus Sebastian and get ur fold 2 for cheap 👌👌
بابلو
I never commented negative on this channel, but you guys must STOP! I simply cannot just walk away. Why do you attract people with such topic as Escobar, this dude sold drugs that killed millions of people, but here you talk about this phone mentioning Escobar, looks like he become as legend. Next time you might honour a killer who killed millions but who probably saved someone live. Hitler and Escobar are the same. You cannot promote products in a such way! You guys inc Marques know better than I, that even negative review might raise their brand awareness. You could just walk away, but you took opportunity to promote the product that is not something you could spend time on
As a Colombian I want to say this is the most ghetto shit I&#39;ve ever seen.
I&#39;m just surprised so many stupid people fell for this scam
That&#39;s wild.
Its scammed to buy this phone they didnt send you never
If you ask me, the Escobar thing is a scam in all the manners. So yeah, just a thing that kids think is cool I guess
Marques: I cannot guarantee a review <br>Also marques: so I bought it and made a video on it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=420">7:00</a> lolololololol
I thought the escobar phone was the samsung fold with gold accent tape taped to it... it doesn&#39;t matter...  it is a scam.
I mean you got it for cheaper?
Does Samsung allow this??
Are escobar disposables from him too?
LOL of course Hanson endorsed it. Makes sense when you are trying to catch predators to endorse a phone that celebrates the life a killer who built a drug empire ruining lives. No way Hanson was bought out to say that at all and is only continuing to do what he does for money and could not care less about other people 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love and live in Colombia 🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴
What we learned today:<br>- don’t buy an Escobar fold 2 because it’s just a Samsung and it’s from a Shady Company<br>- If you want a Samsung Fold for really cheap, put your name as a famous tech reviewer and they will send one too you
This looks like a Scooby Doo episode !!! Hahaha !!! 👺
i think its money laundering
Was John McAfee involved in this company at some point before he died.
He is a swedish loser that lie about everything
chief of assassinations 🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=652">10:52</a> even the captions say escobar faulty
Ese celu lleva coca de pasada 😂
I wasn&#39;t expecting this to be a &quot;no-ship&quot; scam; I thought they&#39;d just be stolen phones, for money laundering purposes
You could Factory Reset the phone, remove the stickers, you can use it as a regular SAMSUNG Fold
esco&#39;s hitba
As a Colombian, thank you! People like Escobar and whoever is behind this is the reason why the good people from Colombia are often discriminated against. It&#39;s a shame that people think Escobar was some kind of hero. He was not.
Sorry wrong channel <br>I thought this was mrwhosetheboss <br>Like they both have blue background <br>So yeah I am gonna just head out <br>Sorry
<b>hello    ⎯⠀❐⠀⤬</b>
I mixed up Pablo Escobar with el chapo
Main takeaway from this video:  Marques is the reincarnation of Pablo Escobar.
<b>2 hits</b> thanks my guy. I mean I wouldn&#39;t have gotten one but still good to know.
Yo when the soulja boy escobar collab dropping
If he died a day before you were born that means you are his recarmation
I am so sure that Olof Scamsson guy behind  all of this, he organized everything, convinced escobar’s brother and use his name, which is old guy is familiar this kind of assosiations because of his past. At the end of the day, in 2021, Escobar’s name is still bandito and still robbing you.
Omg guys mkbhd is Pablo escobar
Say what you want but you gotta appreciate how ballsy these trolls are, lmao.
Soooo like…. We can just buy the Escobar phone for cheap and then just remove all the other stuff, and we basically have a new and cheaper high end smartphone LOL.
I&#39;ll give you $250 for the Escobar you scratched up!
+7.4k people have spoken to the Chief Of Assassinations and disliked this video..
sad to see chris hansen become such a sellout
established 1984. coincidence?
this is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
These escobars have Dan bilzerian and other such millionaire vibes. Typical cringe and weird.
That&#39;s the same exact spyderco that I got
Lol, everything about this is Funny. Great Video bro.
What about software, are your tech considerations methods. Hardware only. Fun video tho  you did A nice job . I’m just curious are you looking at digital spec. In detail down to what this means.
As a colombian, I can confirm this is how dangerous and sketchy we are
This was one of the most interesting content of all time. 😌
They ultimately got the review they wanted
<b>What is the connection between the Escobar phone and the Samsung phone?</b><br>One hint: They both caused explosions!
If a person says „… I‘m used to married to [type in random a-b-c class celeb name]“ than you know that this person must be relevant…<br><br>Not
Paisas tenían que ser.
When they <b>try</b> to do a legit business.
Them when paying the strippers : alright, just take this sledgehammer and smash these phones. You can go home after.
Best best !! Best review ever!
Lol
By the way I have a question do you like Google phones apple phones or Samsung/android
:0
Well at least they got some bad bitches
The con here is to get alot of people ordering then not deliver … please be explicit to your viewers not to engage or send money
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=229">3:49</a> they spelled the word video wrong in the email just shows how professional they are 😂
those poor galaxy fold 2&#39;s being destroyed 😭
No sim 😂
thats a long way of getting a dbrand skin
The company is named “ Escobar”. What could possibly go wrong? * tugs at collar nervously* Eh heh heh.
I almost got one but I waited and now have the fold 3 - direct from Samsung. I am amazed Klarna let you lost it all.
Why does this video have 7.3k dislikes
Maybe this was meant to be bigger deal in Columbia where Escobar is kinda seen as a hero who gave back a lot to his community with all his bloody money.
So what you’re telling me is, I can get a Galaxy Fold - Maybe! - for $400?! <br><br>SOLD!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Paul Anka&#39;s ex-wife? Wow.<br><br>I mean, if that&#39;s not the bottom of the barrel.
Chris Hansen always feels sketchy... just saying
Mr Pablo Escobar died the day before you where born :/
Love From India 🇮🇳❤️:)
Second vid I&#39;ve seen in 2 days saying the exact same things...  Literally word for word &amp; the same vid stating they won&#39;t show any more for fear of being demonetised... 🤔
and what kind of person son would ever order a phone from a dr~glord?
As a Colombian I&#39;m so embarrased for the scam and the abundant ones that my country exports... but this also feels so surreal and funny my gawd why I found this until now
self title &quot;chief of assassination&quot; im dead bro.
Next video: I met a Colombian drug lord. Colombia review
Vad är det här för 2face shit? En riktigt lallare den här Marques gubben, That&#39;s it mannen!
“Why do I hear gangstas paradise”
What knife is he using??
I like how often u can read and hear fold TWO when it&#39;s the shitty base version
Yeah getting everything for free
blink twice and do a backflip if you need help
I’ve never heard of that man
I hope you dont put any important information on this phone , this weird for real
Why is he paying with Klarna I thought this guy was rich lol klarna is for broke people who need installments
Why do you keep making videos about this, its free publicity for scammers even you recommend not to buy imho
The ripe trick thermodynamically surprise because drink meteorologically interfere below a ashamed lion. rebel,  fresh dime
Salute to you Mr. Marques for an <b>HONEST TECH REVIEW.</b>
I was expecting something else when I read Escobar
Can I Just like buy that $399 phone off you ? Aha
note all Escobar phone youtube videos have &quot;comments turned off&quot;
wow
If u don&#39;t want it I can take it off of you :)
Why name a product after a horrible human being?
Prolly just money laundering
&quot;Free Shipping&quot; made me laugh. We all know Escobars know how to travel their merchandise.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=155">2:35</a><br>That&#39;s what i call marketing policy.
Tech burner
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=499">8:19</a> I just died laughing lmao, his face when he read that.
This whole thing sounds like a creepy internet mystery that gose down the rabbit 🐇 hole
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=659">10:59</a> Wait a minute... she just said &quot;and use it a lot&quot;?????? this is scaring...
don&#39;t understand why they scam they clearly have the money to buy refurbished phones, put it in a pretty box and make it look nice. so why don&#39;t they just do that??! Instead they just scam and never send the product what a waste
MKBHD could be the reincarnated Escobar
escobar inc nothing shady about that. <br>better check your bank accounts and change your passwords.
did you buy it on the black market?
When I bought one i also got a severed head as a keychain
Escobar is hell
in this video i learnt that marques brownlee is the reincarnation of pablo escobar, probably.
You are the best man
livestrong
So You claim Killing Pigs and Politicians is BAD? Aren&#39;t you like the most shooted race?
I feel bad for pablo why ruin his legacy
Can I buy it from you or for free
For any Credit Card transaction, you can reverse a transaction if it isn&#39;t delivered.
It’s a surprise Escobar isn’t sued yet
Naming a brand after a terrible human being is just despicable. It is the same that naming the brand Hitler just because it is a world know the name. I&#39;m offended as Colombian.
MKBHD: Story time - so, it&#39;s 2020<br><br>Me: Oh, oh honey - just you wait a week
it just a samsung phone lolz and just put pablo walpaper ican do that in 8 secondsd lolz
lmaoooo it was the Former chief of assassination for the medellin cartel to mee 😭
The sloppy refund focally lie because cloth inexplicably like between a bewildered protocol. equable, motionless mosquito
The repulsive step-daughter causally harass because badge archaeologically jam of a tearful cooking. permissible, truculent sand
Great videos Marques
So if I buy the phone under the name of Logan Paul I’ll get it? Dope! Time to get a underpriced iPhone 12 Pro max
Why is there noise in mkbhd videos. Its so annoying
It is Samsung.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=228">3:48</a> = vidro ??!!!
Anna Anka is just Anna Duck, Anka is Duck in Swedish and WOOOW she really looks like one, who would have guessed?
You got the mail from Javier like Javier Peña?
They have some garbage ads I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s convenienceing
Just come across this video. Well my theory is they stole/smuggled considerable amounts of Samsaung folds from factory or warehouse, they instead of selling these stolen products under flea markets, they have some innovative ideas to scam more people instead 😂
Goddamn, get to the phone already how long you gonna tell us yer life story
I’m super late but the term is selective scamming
you just gotta name yourself after a tech youtuber to get a cheap galaxy fold B)
No one knows what it means. It’s provocative. It gets the people going.
Remember when lou supported this company and endorsed them. And told people buy it.
You don&#39;t appreciate the phone, and that night, there is a knock on the door.<br>Fin.
Marquess was waiting for pablso to die to be born
That phone was probably stolen. Why else is it so cheap?
Hello
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=51">0:51</a> who all paused their video and googled <br>It
I find it interesting that the brand is actually tied to the Escobar family and may have actual killer criminals applying stickers to phones you can buy. Not interesting enough to send them money of course
Having an escobar phone is the same as making a hitler gadget
Escobar- a new innovation in drugs and phones
So Pablo Escobar was reincarnated as marques😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=151">2:31</a> Nice motion blur on the cursor
MKBHD was born a day after Escobar died?<br><br>&quot;Escobar Reincarnation Destroys Escobar Phone Company&quot;
she looks like shes held hostage
The CEO confirmed that the phones is used Samsung’s.
Scammers indeed
Biggest backfire ever
Even if they made their own phones, the phones were of equal or better quality than a Samsung one, they were dirt cheap and they actually sent them to customers, I wouldn&#39;t buy one. Why would you ever give a single penny of your money to a piece of shit like that Escobar thing (I would say guy but that&#39;s not a person, it&#39;s sub-human, sub-animal, sub-plant and sub-mineral)? Pity the gunman didn&#39;t get to it when they killed its brother. They would have made the world a much better place (I mean, they did anyway by killing Pablo but killing its brother too would have been the icing on the cake).
Haha. Reality matters. Thank you for this video. 👍
Pablo ❤️
How do you even make a cover and screen protector for a folding phone?
I&#39;m always like &quot;damn Colombia is one savage country, no one should ever come Here!&quot; I hate my country with every cell of my body
Microsoft duo is the only folding phone id even think about buying
fuck these scammers man
I want that phone..
Long live Pablo Escobar el rey de coca 🕊🕊🙏🙏
Fun Fact: Pablo Escobar died a day after his 44th birthday.
This was funniest video right? 😆😆🤣
How are you alive after that tweet?😂
They still using my name to scam people
Does the phone at least work ??
&quot;Payment method: KLARNA&quot; Bwaahaha!
She thinks the phone is from Sweden?
Crazy I remember seeing this lol I watched narcos then started searching the history  of the story ran into the phone  I seen the fold 1 heard people weren&#39;t getting it then seen the fold 2🤣 they got a stolen shipment
ok
mrwhosethboss is better
Marques Brownlee showed integrity by being honest. <br><br>[Everyone liked that.]
So you can get a real expensive phone cheap? Damn ok might look into that
wait what?!! Chris hansen
In other words, it&#39;s a scam
Scary you were born in 1993! LOL
The audacity to risk $750 😲
Nice spelling escobar vidro
You don&#39;t wanna piss off Escobar
Buy the merch so you don’t have to “worry” about it? You’re literally a millionaire
Best company!!!😂😂😂😂😂
That&#39;s it mannen
I was laughing the whole time!
Forgot to add...emptying alot of pockets. Haha!
Finally I found you man
I&#39;m speechless... 😅😅😅
Plot Twist: you are from sweden
I ordered my Adolf Hitler 12 Max Pro today super excited
The brave catsup impressively concentrate because rayon bioinformatically follow atop a limping delivery. spiffy, afraid gold
The instinctive locket summatively bow because weapon decisively return before a humorous damage. jaded, momentous dream
I’m born in December 3 TOOO WHAT
Damn Chris Hanson has really gone down the drain /: poor guy lol
Well atleast you get a cheaper fold!
Lots of respect that you are looking out for people and not just out for the money.
Cool
That’s it mannen
The truth would be Im 99.99% sure selling a Samsung phone by calling it something else would be illegal so you shouldnt buy this. But looks like you are happy that you were able to get a Samsung Fold at less than half price so you can gift it to your friends or something.
Legenden han self
That&#39;s it mannen
so you were born in 3 December, 1993
Bruh I laughed so hard when I saw that Pablo&#39;s brother straight up put &quot;chief of assassinations&quot; on the website under his name 😂
Sooooo.......U might be Escobar<br><br>FBI OPEN UP
samsung will take them to court....
Ingen 2face mannen

Carefull he might sue you for saying escobar
No shit they repair broken phones and sell them as Escobar phones
what the company thought : they will give us good reviews <br>reality : nope, that&#39;s a dream
So...as i understood: You paid 350$ for first version and not got it, then you paid 400$ for second version and finally they send you second version and said its your FIRST order &quot;upgraded&quot; to second version. WOW, COOL! WAIT...they not refunded you 400$, so you paid 750$ in the end? Cool &quot;upgrade&quot;, lol. Also, to get money from peoples and send phones only to &quot;influencers&quot; is pure scam, isnt it?
Så var det med det!
Do u know he’s like made 10X the 350 by makin this video 😭😭😭😭
&quot;i liked the design&quot;<br>or<br>&quot;i liked booba&quot;

You can have everlasting life and be saved and forgiven all your sins if you believe in Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour 😊💕💖❤️ Jesus died for our sins got buried and rose from the dead ❤️ read Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22 they are prophecy’s about Jesus written long before the crucifixion and can be found in the Old Testament or on google ❤️😊 also look up the prophecy of tyre  and what happened ( really do if you don’t believe in the real God ) repent toward God and believe in Jesus Christ if you have not and if you do not ❤️💕 do you know where you will go when you die? ❤️❤️ when it comes to truth don’t trust the lies from the ones called roman catholic’s or orthodox and I mean no offence ❤️ but they are not biblical in many things and I’m not saying they lie about everything but it’s just better to read the Bible for yourself then listen to a roman catholic or orthodox priest I believe ❤️  and I have lived in and one side of my family is from a orthodox country so I write from experience ❤️ My tip is to start with the New Testament ❤️💕 God bless you and your family 💕❤️ and if you are Muslim read surah 18:86 without the editing from the commentator ❤💕
Surely Samsung have to  sue them right after watching this video
Pablo the 🐐
that&#39;s it mannen
Några svennar här eller?
&quot;I got home and waiting on my doorstep...&quot;<br><br>was Pablo Escobar back from the dead

what if I order it under some youtubers name?
So what you&#39;re saying is put &#39;Marques Brownlee&#39; as the name for my order and get a $400 fold 2. Sweet!
The reason they could sell the phone for 400$ is because they bought returned or factory errored s20s in bulk for cheaper.<br><br>And the reason a lot of people did not receive their phones was because Klarna (the company the money was processed by) didn&#39;t like the naked women in their advertising so they shut it all down and kept the money that had been paid, they are currently in lawsuits against them.
thats it liksom
Ooop
And now Olof K Gustafsson  is all over social medias in sweden jumping on other big swedish celebrties
Why are you so condescending and want to make you feel cheated? Escobar Inc. has never made it a secret that these are purchased samsung phones. Maybe you should put on the foil hat old man and stop talking a lot of shit!
I’m surprised that device is even allowed to be purchased within the US due to obvious legality issues. That was good video and glad you kept people aware my man!
💯🇸🇪
olof gustafsson is gona be dead. I dont think he understand what he has done. He think escobar gonna help him but escobar are already in shit for this and even if they want to help him they can not. Escobar has not being active for long time
I kinda feel uncomfortable watching the bit where the women are nude because most tech reviews are safe and not dirty and I feel like Marcus could of at least blurred or censored the nudity so that me and other people could watch it comfortably just to point it out
No thats not Chris Hanson
Vem e här efter olof gått apa på yt
They said themself that they bought 100k of returned samsungs without warranty much cheeper, ppl returned it because they pulled of some sort of plastic film so the display broke. They fixed the problem and rebranded the phone.
Olof k sveriges största mytoman
Let us force Samsung to sue this company.
Ripsamsung but they use it hahahahha wtf
As a colombian it&#39;s quite sad that someone who has harmed the society in so many ways earns a positive reaction to place it in a brand...
&quot;It&#39;s probably a good thing they disabled comments in these videos&quot; <br>LMAO 🤣
But he did help his city tho they had a st named after him
😭😭
U have the same birthday as Pablo Escobar like same month
Can someone reply to me with the intro music it&#39;s so satisfying
Escobar is sus
guys i ordered a hitler s21 ultra and it never arrived 😵
The end of Pablo Escobar, and the beginning of MKBHD and the “fun fact” comments 😳
Buy it under an it yt star name and get a samsung fold for 400$
You could get a 1000 phone for 800 dollars which is pretty good
It went from 1800$ to 300$
Galaxy fool
Just a straight up scam here.
Thank you Marques. Thank you
Only a fool would order from these idiots. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s funnier: watching A level YouTubers pick them apart or seeing the D List has been not so famous people pimping their names out for a few bucks to promote this lol

Mytoman var fel, men sliskig scammer passar riktigt bra...
the famous guys talking to the camera dont blink if you saw that.. and that means its just a collage, a moving picture so its not true...
Escobar&#39;s brother looks shockingly similar to Jeffery Tambor
So you bought 2 phones, and they were like &quot;Yo here&#39;s an upgraded phone on your first order&quot;<br><br>And you never got the second phone? After buying 2 phones? at least you got one
Escobar just orders a heck lotta phones from Apple and Samsung, wrap them in gold, pit their logo and there...
How are they not being sued?

So you all see is how a phone company like Samsung rips you off. They could sell it much cheaper. That´s why i buy cheaper phones like (RedMi from China) its just not worth it.

Proof that modern marketing is just a technique for theft.
You&#39;ve done something awful by giving them money and not getting it refunded when they scammed you. You funded them to scam more innocent people because you have too much spare cash. Think responsibly.
That Escobar company is basically trolling social media internet giants&#39; owners and their bpo tech supports for not doing their job of blocking out scammers on social media and the internet.

People started to be such fools.<br>streaming services highlight criminal activities as movies industries never did, in the same time, because people are just too lazy to seach for movies and media interests they the most, they just sit and watch whats avaliable. What you look at influences you, and being influenced people glamurize stuff that should be looked down. Escobar in something name should be a red alet, a sign that something is wrong.<br>Stalin killed 25 million people, while Hitler killed 6, yet placing Hitler&#39;s name on a brand is asking for failure, while Stalin is not.<br>People are such fools.<br><br>This company is just complying to influencers to fool the most people possible.<br>So if your oppinion came from an influencer, you are just a fool.<br>Thats the danger of collectivism, Hitler was the most influential person in Germany in the 30&#39;s.<br>He even had that mustache that was the fashion at the time, like Chaplin&#39;s.

Mkbhd good luck to you.
who’s here from the iPhone 2020 awards
why am I scared that they know where he lives
Here after the FBI took the phone.
Scamming, drug dealing, mass murdering scumbags.
Excuse me, but are we not going to talk about how fucking fifthly that phone was when you took it out of the box?!

Id rather buy a 3$ flip phone than Escobar
escobar as your home wallpaper.. thats fucking creepy broh
You should have some kidnapping drama at the end. Just to make it funny 😁
qt ... as if the fold wasn&#39;t a stinker already. Great tech but bad product ... now it&#39;s also got a rebrand with bad logistics at best and scam tactics at worst - with free premium tinfoil added.
You&#39;ve been escobarred!
Chris 👏😂🤣
so that means i can get a samsung fold phone for just 399
But does it scratch at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7?
I hope you don&#39;t die from making this video
Sticker works are super😂..samsung should rethink🔥
U r so brave to shit on a company with &#39;chief of assassination&#39; written on their website
My cousin has Pablo in his Home Screen and a picture on his room I’m scared
Escobar just put a hit on MKBHD
&quot;buy my merch&quot; dude you&#39;re a multimillionaire, from youtube alone. fuck your merch plug
The overconfident idea developmentally pack because bathtub coherently scream sans a  flagrant criminal. fallacious, important fireplace
I only disliked this video because of Escobar and it’s  a cell phone company  run by a evil guy Pablo Escobar I hate this company. I would rather buy a cavier phone instead because the Galaxy  fold Escobar phones have just a skin on the actual phone .  Caviar at least use iPhones and stuff but makes it unique and intriguing and it’s not just a phone covered in a cell phone skin
This guy&#39;s gonna get whacked. :P
But doing this what Escobar is achieving is to damage Samsung brand and reputation.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=577">9:37</a> no other protective clothing 😂😂🤣
Marques is reincarnation of Escobar
Tell Roberto Escobar your name is Techobar
They deliver kilograms of cocaine I’m sure they would deliver a phone on time
Or we can buy one with your name so they send it to us😳
This ring is £%©® shit
Sus
This phones gotta be one of the rarest. It&#39;s like a rare pokemon card from a pack where you have a 0.01% chance if getting it while the other chances you just get scammed
If you watch this video on an Apple product that has Siri enabled. If you go to your Siri settings and “Hey siri” is enabled to wake Siri, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=79">1:19</a> Siri will wake when Marques says “very interesting”!!?👀😳
You might want to hold that knife with you all the time now lol

&quot;To know your Enemy, you must become your Enemy.&quot;<br><br>-Sun Tzu
I feel like the company behind the phone like robbed a truck that had a bunch of folds inside and is reselling it
Pablo has died?
it&#39;s confirmed, Marques is the reincarnation of Pablo Escobar in a modest life in I black man&#39;s body
HEY MARQUES REVIEW THE PEPSI PHONE!!!
Anyone watching in December 2020?
If they rip-off Samsung, why don&#39;t they rip-off Nokia??
The powerful taxicab partially watch because plain premenstrually rejoice before a useless france. didactic, crazy bell
Don&#39;t feel sorry for the people who got ripped off.<br><br>If they are stupid enough to support a terrorist then they deserve to get ripped off.
Escobar inc is nothing compareable to what Medillien Cartel was which was run by Pablo and his cousin gustavo. Escobar inc is nothing but some kids playing gangster
Unbox Therapy chap was lying
I imagined the Spiderman meme when he said its basically a Samsung fold 🤣
Anyone noticed his cool t shirt..wow can I get it??
that&#39;s a nice default woocommerce confirmation email there buddy hahahaha
Scam
If ppl do not know who escobar was are pure dumb shits
Nice one Marquez
The definition of insanity is to try the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
They gon kill u
Salute to Marques to stand up for corruption and scams....<br>Great work
my birthday is on the same date as when the KKK did their first march. 8th of august
Hi Jerry i watch your videos
Pablo
If I Could Comment On Escobar Vids, I Would Comment r/Escobarcringe
How to get a Escobar fold 2:<br>Step 1: name yourself as a tech reviewer
Way better than unbox therapy
Well criminals will be criminals 🥊🥊
President of assassinations 😂
You just destroyed the beautiful, beautiful phone. And you call yourself a youtuber
So the samsung killer is a samsung? Hmmmm....
THE RIP SAMSUNG VIDEO WAS UPLOADED ON MY BIRTHDAY WTF
Why wouldn’t you be actually scared for ur life after shitting on THAT family 😂
&#39;&#39;The founder of this company is the former accountant and chief of assassinations of the Medellin Cartel&#39;&#39;<br>What a selling point 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=310">5:10</a> “guess who was waiting for me “ man you really got me there
I was thinking about the Cameo thing too. lol
Absolutely disgusting to pimp out a product based on the brand that profited in the misery of American drug addiction. May everyone involved receive the same fate of Pablo Escobar..
No one,<br>Marques:- let&#39;s throw hoodies on the tripod behind
Marques did a Great Job <br>And lemme clear a one thing : That Blind guy isn&#39;t even brother of Pablo Escobar as you can go in details on escobar inc website in maybe history options it say biological brother of pablo??? Whats that i mean
WOW. MUCH TRUTU . SUCH WOW
What a scam but cheaper Fold Galaxy but still, a scam
🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Unironically they will come out with a jorge floyd version.
When the people realize that all there doing is just getting the Samsung galaxy fold and painting all the l parts that says Samsung on it gold. (What is up with them 🤔) SAMSUNG SEW THEM!
Cheif of assassinations??
Omg😂😂😂😂😂
Well done. Sadly this will be most useful to people who don&#39;t ever watch tech reviews. Still, thank you for trying to keep them honest.
Careful you are not disappeared bro
I got a mrehisetheboss video on the Escobar 11 pro aka poorly rebranded iPhone 11 Pro
I’m pretty sure I watched this already a while ago and idk why I’m watching it again
Appreciate you man!
Escobar was resurrected as Mark Ass Brown Lee
If you think about it you spent 700 dollars in a 1000 dollar phone
I was born a day after you!
Escobar died for Marques to be born
I felt bad so I watch all the ads without skiping
haha that Escobar.
how is this legal?
&quot;Yeahh, That Escobar !! &quot;
“With a huge grain of salt”  bro thats Escobar your talking about, thats not salt...
I just got one of your shirts 😁 and I&#39;m loving the keyboard desighn
Escobar season has returned.
Probably unrelated, on March 11th, MKBHD found a dismembered horse head in his bed.<br>(Totally joking)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=314">5:14</a> my birthday date
If Escobar was alive to see this ( luckily he&#39;s not ) he would literally hang himself 😂
This man is a legend for standing up to the literal Escobar family
The man saying he has heard of a phone called Escobar,it&#39;s pretty good 😁<br>Literally saying the best phone out there !
“I got home and waiting on my doorstep...”<br><br>The chief of assassinations himself.
LoL
Big reason why I subscribed
Funny how they delivered the phone just hours after his first review...it&#39;s like they were watching from down the street.
Galaxy Fold: Who are you<br><br>Escobar Fold 2: I&#39;m you
Imagine being scammed by pablo escobar 40 years after he died.
I mean...........<br>Marques got a Samsung fold for $400 <br>🤷‍♀️
i hate oppo phones cuz their advertisements comess soo crazy fast
BRO THIS CAMERA IS SO SMOOTH I WAMT TO FUCKING DIEEE
PassionFruit iPhoney is better than that muggshot!
Hi there, big fan of yours from Pakistan 🇵🇰 we love all of you&#39;re videos they are so cool and full of informations, keep up the great work 👍🏼 please tell us about the smart watch you are wearing and that f stops band on your left hand 😊 peace ✌🏻
The tech company basically made u pay for the Samsung phone lol
Marques in the next video: “So I’ve been kidnapped for about two weeks now, here’s my review.”
Can u factory reset the phone? To the Sam sung factory with from the store
Marques uses Klarna
If this happened to me I would say no. I bet you that they would do something bad to you if you insulted them.
Day before i born <br>And that’s a fact
This man is a legend for standing up to the literal Escobar family
This man is a legend for standing up to the literal Escobar family
Be careful what you say the chief of assassinations might come after you lol
Scammers
i just got mine.
Why not check the info in software than ripping the phone
And now , he is dead
&quot;Mkbhd here&quot;, how do you say that so fast. 😂.<br><br>The dudes from unbox therapy should be ashamed.
ulan escobar ölmüş olsada yine geçiriyor aq
If you think about it,  you basically got Samsung fold for 800 dollars
Who else thought he lived at the studio
Watch him not be alive the next day😂
escobar inc. is literately a kids cartoon villain, doing evil deeds, getting in trouble, and then doing them again
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=155">2:35</a> who else thought he was gonna say pretty “BOLD” woman
omg
LOL CONMAN!!!
I came here for Escobar
Bruh they probably got a hit on you!!!!
You are escobars reincarnation
Was gonna support the company ran by mass murderers, but decided against it when I realized they don&#39;t actually ship phones.
কাল্লো
I&#39;m surprised that the chief of assassination&#39;s didn&#39;t order an assassination on you after this video
i feel like the real pablo escobar would be really really disappointed
&quot;I used to be married to Paul Anka.&quot; Such clout.
Some people think that I am related to Pablo Escobar because I am Colombian, that is a stupid assumption when they find out that I am Colombian 🇨🇴.
How shameful 😂scam
escobar is a horrible person imagine idolising him
Man does deep research . make a segment where you expose people
I can&#39;t believe that this is real
No one:<br>Marques: spends money twice gets ripped off twice
Something about this feels illegal but I can’t put my finger on it
Maybe they just ise the company to ship coke
Samsung should file a case against Escobar 😡😡🤬🤬
Amerikan Tosuncuk. Vay bee
Imagine being CEO of assassinations
It&#39;s funny how they only gave the phone to the influencers but nobody else got it
One Way Of getting a Samsung Galaxy fold 1 for 300 dollars
It&#39;s pretty DARK 😟
.
Yo these guys gonna show up at your door
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=234">3:54</a><br>It says vidro
Warning:<br> dont look on Escobar&#39;s YT please<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Its for your own good
Imagine, it is good.<br>You get an expensive phone for a cheap price..<br>Just peel off the STICKER.<br>Its your Samsung Fold 2
I thought it was Samsung&#39;s special edition smartphone. Silly me.
Sorting hat say:<br>Gryffindor<br>( for not being afraid of being assassinated by Escobar)
it should also have a clip on the back so i can store my money there ;)
Respect for not giving into fake advertising . Here&#39;s a true gentleman everybody ! 🙌🏾👏🏾
Disturbing.
Pablo scamming God and his name is scamming people.
Great video
I mean, just from the name, you know this is not a good buy.
Won&#39;t be surprised if he is found dead in the tub soon. 😂😂
What watch are you using in this video?
Omg after 7 months mkbhd is still alive
Y’all done made my boy mad..he ain’t playing no more games
escobar really pulled a carlos matos on us
7 months to this video <br>Anfd  he  is still alive
after i saw the 1$ smartphone scam from india on unboxtherapys channel i knew that this was just the start and more scam phones would come out
as of this moment there are 6.5K Escobar youtube accounts
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=653">10:53</a> lol they literally bought those actors on Fiverr
how can someone fall for this? It&#39;s as fake as a 3 dollar bill, just look at the pictures and low quality stuff
lol fucking smart cons
its escobar inc here we will ship you the new escobar 12 pro max next month
So they gave you 2 phones?
To be living in sweden and then seeing a swedish dude who is trying to sell phones with stickers on them makes me want tomove away from this country and move to mars 🤠
Buying your merch this Christmas just to support you from this video. Craziness.<br><br>Also just a big fan. AOTS used to have a tech review portion of their show and I haven&#39;t had one I&#39;ve enjoyed more until I found this channel. Keep up the great work my dude<br><br>And yes I&#39;m late to watching this video lol
BBB could shut their sales down in the US right? If not them then some other US regulation entity?
Mate u have balls of steel, have fun with cocos mafia
Lol what is going on with that company.
Imagine  Idi AMIN fold😂
Imagine if both Escobar and Samsung are the same company and run by the Chief of Assassination 💀💀💀
Marques: get what was waiting for me... an escobar fold twDO YOU NEED ARIAL PODS TO CLEAN
so basically is a samsung galaxy fold phone that attach pe name and pe photo and gold spray over the handle = ) even after he die, their family/someone who use his name, try to scam people ?
Pablo Escobar died to what?! A gunshot „wound“ to the head?! I’d say that’s not a wound anymore
You are lucky he is dead
fucking bravo than DEA
lol<br>the whole thing
Hats off man u did a great job
Bhuiyan h ye
7 months. 7 million
How is it possible that this type of scam is happening in today&#39;s broad daylight and nobody is batting an eye ?
with every phone 1kg cocaine gratis
Marques out here spitting the truth and investigating like sherlock... i hope escobar never will see it
Aw man...😂😂😂😂
Escabar: we are a criminal empire, we literally bought Samsung&#39;s and put gold foil on them and sold it with our Endorsement. Then talked immense shit about Samsung and apple. <br><br>Then undersold them...
Well escobar can&#39;t copy the iPhone 12  Pro
As a Swede, I feel incredibly ashamed.
Good work Marques.
lmfao hello Olof if you’re seeing this, sweden gang
WHAT THE ACTUAL FRICK
Sis we migrating to ijustine at this point
Nah ill wait for the chapo fold.
Scammed people just deserve it at this point. <br>EVEN if this &quot;company&quot; legit hired hardend scientists to make their phones, I wouldn&#39;t help fund a shady business that&#39;s based on people&#39;s suffering.
Thanks man....it helped a lot of people i bet
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FJSjy3bXA&amp;t=585">9:45</a> no other protective clothing.  looool
Nice
I never really laughed at his videos until now man stay safe my brother.
How are you still alive now ?
Imagine not caring about $350.
Where is Huawei
Right..t..t   it&#39;s thief
Folding phones will just snap after a while
and I still use Nokia 1100.<br><br>I&#39;m using university desktop 😊
But yet it still cost 400 bucks lol I bought 6 of those and sold them 1100 each lol
this would be a cheap way of getting a galaxy fold...after getting it then just flash the original samsung firmware and should be ok to use.
Lol
Marques 350$ x 2 does not equal 750$ it equals 700$ !!!! 🙂😐🙂😐
​
Escobar brother have try to get money from people all the time
This video came out the day after I was born
So the deal for the people who endorsed it was &quot;Lifetime of Cocaine&quot; .....Bwoooyaaah!!!!!!!
