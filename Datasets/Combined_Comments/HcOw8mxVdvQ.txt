I recently bought a new car, but it had less registration than i originally thought, so the other day i got sent 2 letters at the same time. One saying i need to pay to complete the tranfer or I&#39;ll be fined, and another one saying i need to pay to renew the registration. The annoying part is i cant pay the registration unless the car is in my name, and i cant get the car in my name unless its registered. Who actually comes up with this stuff?

I actually didn&#39;t know that about plastic bags...
if you want to get a constantly reusable bag then you should go for nylon and not cotton.
just because a phone has the option for cords doesnt force you to use cords, but it lets others who dont have wireless headphones actually be able to use them
LOVE YOUR VIDEOSSS
can I still win the chair?
Pewds be woke dawg wakanda
Pewdiepie is evil we see him wear shirts with Russian flag, he is a supporter of the Ukraine war, unsubscribe immediately. It feel sad to unsubscribe after so many years but some things are more important supporting kil ling of innocent people  I can¬¥t not be part of. Boycott Pewdiepie. Slava Ukraine
this man i awesome, I have been watching him ever sense 2016 and he had showed me how to be myself. I have  been much more social and I have gathered more friends.

&quot;props to pringles, at least you don&#39;t get scammed&quot;<br>all the pringles cans come half full at the store though...<br><br>I mean really, when was the last time you turned a pringles can upside down before opening it and it DIDN&#39;T turn weightless for a good second before all the chips crossed the gap of emptiness and slammed into the lid making it jump out of your hands...
I mean, flushable toilet wipes don&#39;t have to be nonharmful to stuff in the ocean...<br><br>where I live we have this thing called a sceptic tank where it all goes, and the reason you don&#39;t wanna use normal wet wipes is because it clogs it up and causes some major issues that you gotta call people in to fix.<br><br>and I don&#39;t know a lot about how they take care of waste closer to the sea, or in cities, but I&#39;m fairly sure it isn&#39;t just dumped into the ocean. otherwise there&#39;d be plenty of toilet paper in the sea.

Tbh when you buy chips, you pay for the weight and not for the size of the bag.<br>If you can&#39;t understand that, you&#39;re a moron. Also it says net 500g so it doesn&#39;t even count the bag itself.
I don&#39;t think the asshole design is the headphone jack itself, its that Apple took something off their devices just to charge you more.

You&#39;re being scammed out of printer ink;<br><br>The computer uses the color cartridges to make the &quot;auto&quot; color (which appears black) instead of using the black ink, which is why it needs colors to print in black.<br><br>So switch off auto and select black, or print in black and white on settings.

Another reason to hate fedex, they treat they&#39;re employees like shit, they give you pto (paid time off) but dont let you use it, they make people who cant lift heavy objects (disabled or handicapped people) lift 200-300 pound boxes when there is a whole section literally dedicated to the small packages that they put all the people that are buff as fuck and can easily lift the heavy shit in, the safety standards at the warehouse are atrocious.

Bags of chips actually don&#39;t have &quot;air&quot; in them. It&#39;s a nitrogen mixture that helps keep the chips fresh and crispy longer. <br>If it was air, they would be stale when you opened it.

Chips actually have so much air in the bag because they are trying to protect the chips during the shipping process. The air makes it so that a lil squeeze won&#39;t crush the chips inside as much. But that said, the two 500g bags of doritos is stealing and doritos needs to pay.
True, but in my country: 0,0001% chips and 99,9999% air

The thing about that not having headphone Jacks if you&#39;re out in public and let&#39;s just say your wireless ones that die it&#39;s nice to have a backup Wireless pair  so you can still do whatever the hell you&#39;re doing. They just remove the headphone Jacks do you have to buy another thing to order to use headphones it&#39;s so bulshit either you have to buy their earbuds or you could buy this headphone thing

There is a science for soft pack chips based on gas injection and psi thatpreserves your chips and makes them not turn to dust from impact in shipping, but that large bag is bananas.
Jokes on you...I still have headphone jacks<br><br>Adding discord friends is really easy...want a demonstration?
Said so many times where chip companies inflate, people don&#39;t know it&#39;s for packaging reasons so your chips don&#39;t come as a powder.
Honestly that&#39;s a pet peeve of mine, DVDs and blu-rays at this point should just go straight to the menu and then be able to play without having to watch ads watch warnings any of that shit, honestly I don&#39;t even like to see animation or scenes or anything when I pop a DVD in I just want to get to the menu and get to my movie and have the options for the behind-the-scenes stuff and bloopers and crap but I don&#39;t want ads I don&#39;t want all the FBI warnings all that craps unskippable and they&#39;re going to bootleg it with or without that warning
I think that&#39;s one of the reasons why I really haven&#39;t wanted to get a new TV especially a smart TV because of all that bullshit
in latvia some people just dont pay for the bullshittery, they cant do anything.

ou know its bad when buying a new printer is cheaper than refilling your ink.<br><br>2.1 K
But Felix, why you don‚Äôt stream on dlive anymore?
I&#39;m in percussion in the band and I have to pay thousands for drums. They then charge me for a band shirt.
Best way to deal with ink, once you run out, sell your old printer then buy another printer with the money you got from selling your old printer. Ink is more expensive then printer, but since you resell and buy at the same price you don‚Äôt lose any money.

I live in NYS and we have paper bags, I personally switched to reusable after we stopped using plastic. But I work at a dollar general so I have to bag paper bags and it&#39;s not that bad cause you can fit more in them but at the same time you have to watch the weight of the bag cause obviously if it gets too heavy it&#39;ll rip. And it&#39;s also a pain with freezer/fridge products because the bag is gonna get wet eventually and fall apart. I&#39;ve never heard anything from customers saying they&#39;ve had issues with the bag getting wet from product but I&#39;ve had people complain about bags tearing at the bottom or whatever else (whether it&#39;s with our bags I have no idea) but apparently the ones DG uses are not that bad, and they even have handles. <br><br>There are also people that roughly handle paper bags as if they&#39;re indestructible and sometimes they rip, most of the time however they don&#39;t and I stand there thinking &quot;omg no&quot; and I feel relieved when it doesn&#39;t rip but I don&#39;t know what happens when they get out the door so who knows. Paper isn&#39;t that bad but at the same time it has its inconveniences

I remeber once buying a pack of chips opening it and there was no chips it was just air, I dont think anyone ate the chips as there wasn&#39;t even a crumb and the bag looked untouched.
why did this suddenly get in my recommended again,
Fun fact : When you buy a snack, you buy most the air than the snack üòÜ
Fact: Theair above chips is nitrogene and prevents chips from getting expired. So the companies are not cheapskates but they just put the air to make their products last longer.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I know it is not funny but it is the truth

Government is the biggest and shittiest scam.  Get rid of it all.

Omg is that why my Epson printer suddenly thinks I have no ink? Fml. Fk you Epson <b>throws printer in the trash</b>
The thing with the cotton bags tho <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcOw8mxVdvQ&amp;t=1065">17:45</a> : we have three bags for at least all of my life, i&#39;m 19, my mom uses them whenever she shops. Not sustainable, huh? I mean you don&#39;t just throw them away at some point, right?
Hiiii
Toilet thing pisses me off so much, i don&#39;t mind paying for the cleaning, but many times i wasn&#39;t carrying coins with me so i had to get cash from a machine and then buy stuff around to get change while holding my piss like a champ just so i can be in for 30 secs
Life is a scam
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcOw8mxVdvQ&amp;t=529">8:49</a> I had two Epson printers growing up. The first one worked about 3 times then constantly drew streaks in my paper and such even after cleaning and refilling it. The second one DOESN‚ÄôT EVEN CONNECT TO MY COMPUTER. Even the tech help wasn‚Äôt sure what to do!<br>Fuck Epson, I‚Äôm getting a simple HP printer next time

You know what the dumbest thing about taxes is? They never teach you how to do them. I&#39;m at my last year of secondary school and I have literally no idea how to do taxes or when to do them.

What‚Äôs with UK and unfair taxes?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcOw8mxVdvQ&amp;t=626">10:26</a>
Chip bags have lots of air so the chips don&#39;t break.
like !
thats why i got an ink reservoir printer. it last a lot longer and it wont know if you put 3rd party ink in it because no chip.<br>Its more expensive but you save a ton not buying $40 of ink every week.
I can relate to the thumbnail. When you buy a bag of chips it looks like there‚Äôs more than there are. Also with bigger bags,you will naturally think there is more, but they are cheapskates.
Can&#39;t wait to wirelessly power my desktop PC. Or wirelessly connect my GPU to my Motherboard.
Felix the reason you need color ink to print in black and white is because your printer actually uses a bit of color ink when you print using black ink to waste more of your money.

The mumbo jumbo case wasnt a sample but what happened was he used a remix (the guy who made the remix let him use it btw) but the guys who made the original claimed him because they were kinda similar

Dude, Phoenix Kill Burg, please... I get your point about the whole demonetization because of 2 seconds being BULLSHIT and I entirely, unequivocally, 100% agree with you ‚Äî however, in the end, the person who used that clip to begin with without authorization has to be held accountable and is ultimately the single entity responsible for incurring this unfair treatment. They could simply have avoided using copywrited material in the first place.<br><br>But again, I am NOT saying that I agree with the music industry or the movie industry at all. Their behaviour is abhorrent and abysmal of course. But again, the person acting in contraindication of the strict copyright laws is ultimately the responsible one here.

The flushable wipes thing is a misunderstanding by the OP.  ‚ÄúFlushable‚Äù wipes means they can be flushed down the toilet, where the waste material is then routed through the sewers to waste treatment for cleaning. ‚ÄúFlushable‚Äù means that the wipes will not clog up your pipes or the sewer (paper towels, by comparison, are not flushable and can cause blockages). <br><br>‚ÄúFlushable‚Äù does not mean non-toxic or bio-degradable and does not indicate that something can be disposed of in, say, a freshwater river or lake without harmful effects. <br><br>Pissing, shitting and throwing toilet paper into your koi pond will certainly cause harmful effects to your fish. That‚Äôs why we have advanced SEWER SYSTEMS.

My Epson printer was pulling that shit as well, I knew I had to buy the black ink and the three colours to be able to actually print in black. I AM A BROKE COLLEGE STUDENT THO BACK TF OF MAN. So I went to the store and bought the inks but not the black one. I printed my paper in a really, really dark green tone ( it looks black tbh). Could I just have bought the black ink too at that point? Yes. Was I just being stubborn? Also yes.

I once had a plastic package that was abnormally thick. I couldn&#39;t pry it open, and I couldn&#39;t get anything between the two halves. I ended up using a paring knife that I heated up with the stovetop. I&#39;d slowly melt a small line along one side, wipe off the melted plastic on the knife, reheat it, and repeat. It took half an hour, stank to high heaven, and ruined the knife. What was in the package, you ask? <b>A pair of scissors!</b>

Hi
American mobile companies do suck, thankfully fedex doesnt charge you for a package someone sent you, and if a news article wants me to turn off adblocker for their already crap article, then i guess they dont deserve me reading it lol

Here in Denmark you report your income, what type of income it is and then you get an estimate. If you&#39;re over or under they reimburse you or send you a bill for the rest once a year.<br>Other than that our taxes are mindblowingly high here(60% of everything if you make a lot and 35%-45% normally), the system is fine.
His censor noise is going to destroy my surround bro
Who was watching this video and got a pwedipie add

I like his videos before watching it.
Have you ever noticed Felix looks like the actor Owen Grady
Pewdiepie: FRICK YOU EPSON<br>Me: <b>Looks at my printer</b><br>Printer: E P S O N
You know what? I saw a pattern. Before Felix got married, he grew beard. He came to have a long beard. Just before his marriage, it disappeared. Again, after his marriage, the beard re-grew, and is still growing. And, the length of the beard is an indication of his madness, which I like very much.&#39;
got a pdp commercial in this. nice
the pewdiepie add I saw in the beginning of this video made me cry &lt;3
Simp is just another word for gentle man
Felix says he doesn&#39;t know how to use discord and in his among us games with other YouTubers it shows.
