Soy mexicana y me he vuelto, ansiosa por ver más películas de la india, tengo que verla sin duda después de leer sus recomendaciones ❤
2024
It&#39;s it to a great well best.😊
Why are there no dialogues in the trailer, it is mostly made of music. This is slightly worrying. That being said it is my favourite movie of all times.
So my bf is not indian. He watches indian movies with me but has never seen this before. We have been working towards this one since it&#39;s sooo long. Found this trailer so he could decide if he wanted to watch and my word you can&#39;t tell anything from it 😅😂😂😂😂.
Congratulations for completing 22 years of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham
Happy 😊

Is this not a sequel to kuch kuch Hota hai?
I ❤ srk and Karol best
Great actors good movie
Fact :-You are here cause you have already watched it 👍❤
Hit like if you are watching this in 2023
Pehele trailer se zyada film pe dhyan diya jata tha isiliye filmein acchi hoti thi aajkal film pe zyada trailer pe by the way Iam 90&#39;s kid<br>SRK❤ IS CHILDHOOD CRUSH
Not just a movie this masterpiece is an emotion
Only kjo understands the real potential of Shahrukh Khan. All kjo movies along with srk were something else which cannot be created now. Whether it is his latest rockey and Rani.
My mom brought this home on VHS 📼
Deleted scenes ko add karke again release karte toh phir se ye movie hit hota. Rocky aur Rani ki Prem Kahani se best hota..
Any one here after rocky aur rani trailer. I feels kkhh was once in a bluemoon magic. Even kjo can&#39;t recreate that era❤❤
Who&#39;s here after watching ROCKY AUR RANI KI PREM KAHANI trailor?
Came here after watching Rocky aur Rani Ki prem kahani trailer. And realised this era of KJ was something else. I doubt his new movie can recreate those magics. K3g, kkhh, khnh, mnik all were class apart, stylish, dramatic, melodramatic, larger than life characters but at the same time heart touching, classy elegant. They were perfect blender of love, comedy, madness, romance, emotions, relationships and the awesome casts. And the musics were so good. There is not a single song of those movies which I don&#39;t like.
The Best Movie EVER ❤❤❤
Karan Johar’s Fictional World..
Any one 2023???
This looks like donkey if ya know what I mean- like 7-11 mixed with 9-11 and apu from the Simpsons
Childhood memories 💜💜💜
This era of Bollywood are unforgettable This Shahrukhkhan will always remember
Bakwas movie
Woahh,, Every frame, every melody,.. this movie is lives in our emotions.
Shahrukh Khan is a best best actor for all time<br>Love 💕😘 Action, Drama, Comedy perfect in all characters
It was a 14th December 2001 kabhi Kaushi kabhie  Gham.... Full movies.. Karan Johan.. Director..  Soo very good Very Good.. 👍👍👍 🎊🎊🎊🎊💞🎉🎉🎉🎉😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Jao  kishi se kishi ko door nahi karna
Glorious well. So good. Best.
This single movie is enough to represent entire Bollywood
My first movie jo theatre mai dekhi thi...2001 ko bas 7,8 saal ka tha
Once in a ages 💎
That was a masterpiece way ahead of its time ❤️
Bible fresh waters
they really don&#39;t make movies like this no more..
On that erra how well designed the trailer is  they don&#39;t reviled the songs but they use every bit of those song
Abhishek bacchan should give a special appearance in this video
❤️❤️❤️

Amitabh Bachchan sir, jaya Bachchan mam, shah rukh khan sir, kajol devgun mam, Hrithik Roshan sir, kareena kapoor khan mam and all other actors and actresses are acting is superb in this hindi movie kabhi khushi kabhi gham and the music is awesome and fantastic and the songs are superb to hear in the morning hours and in the evening hours okay 👋😀😇😇👍👍👍👍👍🎉🎉🎉🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹👌👌💐💐
The greatest bollywood movie
2 sbse badi bat movie ki amitabh bachan amd voice of lata di
Kabhie khushi kabhie gham<br>The perfect title. Haste haste kab ro denge pata hi nhi chalega.
This movie is just awesome ♥️♥️
Los mejores actores de la India se unieron para hacer esta película, han pasado muchos años desde la primera vez que la vi y sigue siendo mi favorita
Karan Johar Movies are always special . There is something extraordinary in each movie and every movie is special and carries a particular theme. Though the story is simple but it is presented in such  manner that it leaves memories in our heart forever and we  never feel bored watching that movie again and again. The direction , screenplay ,music everything is superb . We laugh ,we cry and we learn so much from these movies .thanks Karan for these priceless masterpieces.
No story revealed..this was past..movies with substance and trailer revealing nothing..but now a days.. trailer shows entire movie
It is best. Accusteelsoodiesote.
Agar esi movies ab aa jaye to south ki film chalna band ho jayengi
Karachi mein videos centres ka harami pun yeh tha ke her new copy mein 2 se 3 scene ghayab, aur craze was such k her dfa un scenes ko dekhne k lie we would bring the cd on rent and watch the whole movie..SRK was the King back then
This is such a grand movie. Each scene of the movie gives you goosebumps.
This movie is really emotional
Still goosebumps in 2022. Like if you agree 👍🏼
Whatsoever anyone says, but Karan Johar&#39;s all films are box office cult...I love how he direct his movies, not the recent ones but ya old ones<br>Cannot imagine this was his 2nd movie only
Such a crap trailer for a crap movie!
It&#39;s an full emotions
&quot;It&#39;s all about loving your parents&quot; the best thing❤️
Jzt Oh My  God!!😍
Best time of 2001🥂❤️
Uff this film
20 years of this epic movie 🍿
20 years completely
Hats off to Karan who dared to bring these legends together...The movie has a special place in our hearts. Back then, I still remember I visited the video center to get a copy of it multiple times as it was only available in video cassettes in karachi.
20 years complete this movie
The caption at the end was more suited to Baghban than it was to K3G.
My all time fav movie... Just love this one.. Lots of memories are there with this movie... I first time took to my mom theater for this movie wich i wl never forget.. Love u srk.. Loved d bonding with u nd jaya bachhan is the best part of the movie... 😘😘😘
Today Mark 20 Years Of This Movie....✨✨✨<br>Thanks Dharma Movies For Making Childwood Awesome ❤️✨🌈
I am being immersed in the way how jaya bachchan expresses herself in those emotions and the other reason is shahrukh khan. Just finished now, yes still because you can cravings like this. Loved each and every part of the movie but totally got blown away and felt a deep sense in jaya bachan expressions. She is the best mother to him ❤️

K3G IS HOLY
Ye film mere Jiban ki all time favourite ke list me Saamil Nahi ho paayi - <br><br>Bajah hai -  kharina Kapoor sirf aur sirf uski Bajah se pure family ke Sath ye film dekhna Kisi erotic movie dekhne jaisa hai<br><br> 😠 Agar Vo  Nahi Hoti ya fir uski role ko Thoda SA decent Jo ki family ke Sath Dekh sakte esa role hota Toh - All Time Favourite 💝 jarur ban jaata Unfortunate thing.
i miss k3g
hrithik can do any role....so versatile
To, że ten film jest dobry to mało. Podoba mi się postawa głównego bohatera, który opuszcza dom rodzinny, ponieważ rodzina nie zaakceptowała jego ukochanej. Brawo Indie.

A subtile study of KKKG has been realised by the French writer Mrs D. Aubier into her book about Indian cinema where she reveales the symbolical and archetypal structure of the film. +++ <a href="http://dominique-aubier.com/crbst_25.html">http://dominique-aubier.com/crbst_25.html</a>

It is elastic bonding. It is sad and doplomacy and not string upon to have glaring relation. It is have things to make that full swings finishes all dots to have its rise to mark level knot. It is there is auspicity grief half melancholic but Gh there is gazing drop glance.
My favorite movie

i can’t stop crying whenever the ending of this movie comes. it’s so amazing I’ve watched this so so many times and still can’t help but cry.  this movie is beautiful. dramatic but beautiful ❤️🥺
Biswas nhi hota,karan johar ne direct Kiya hai 🧐
Love you 😘❤️❤️
The time I read  in class 8th. I remember lot of  moments
In hindsight this film was over long , however despite its length , the film was very good . Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham put forth the ideas of parental love vs traditions vs oaths . A great movie that offered a rollercoaster of emotions . 8/10. Great preformance by all cast . Rani was a delight in the film . Such an iconic movie and is one of the few indian movies that  started the transformation of indian cinema .
Itep social problem psychiatry. It is slateosteip psychiatry.
This is best movie
Yrrr ye full movie ek sath b bej do plz

Iske jaisa aur koi movie hai to batao yaar please please bhaiyo
I don’t watch Bollywood films that much. But because of all the hype I went to see it in the cinema. It was a fun film at the time but I think it’s a bit OTT and silly now.
I remember when this film came out in late 2001. There were posters everywhere advertising it weeks before its release. Everyone was singing the songs and talking about it. Especially Kareena Kapoor’s character. Some cable channels<br>apparently played it everyday.
Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham &#39;It&#39;s all about loving your parents&#39; - a beautiful film by Karan Johar about relationships and bringing families together.
Worst movie trailer ever BTW the movie is the best 🙂
The first bollywood movie i had seen as kid 😊😊❤
I love all the songs in this movie
When it was released ?
This film is in my favourite top 10 films
Yang suara indonesia dong

k3g all time favorite👍👍😋
you know what this is my beloved films
kareena kapoor and jaya bachan spoiled the thumbnail.
This is one of my favourites, in my late twenties and I dislike majority of Bollywood films, too much kissing and sex scenes, no longer any family or moral films. I used to love watching filsm with my mom, Mohabattein, Veer Zaara, KKHH, KHNH, love the classics, theses were the films you can watch with family. The last film I watched with my mom was Prem Ratan, that was a clean family film. But this film was one of the best, excellent characters, great acting, amazin songs, clean, no sex scenes and a awesome family firm with a great message. I wish Bollywood goes back to its roots.
Shahrukh khan kajol kabhi khushi kabhie gham
2017???
super
Without Kareena I can&#39;t imagine this movie. 2nd part was lit just because of her and how can Dharma prod. Not mention her name in the title of this video?
This is one of those films that I can watch for more than 100 times<br>And one of the reasons is &quot;SHAHRUKH KHAN&quot;
SHAVA SHAVA
plzzz full movie
My most watched movie.... More than 100 times

Best movie ever
I love this movie but trailer is not good
The best movie ever!❤️
Omg best movie 10/10 IGN DANK Worldstar 420 Get mom the camera. Great movie of 1546. Great movie if you love Indian women dancing like the blow ups at those car dealerships. Plus I would reccomend this movie to my friend Abdul Yehee,m and Jafishi Mabar. And I would like to say this movie shoud be rated R because Im not indian and It has a lot of women in it and not enough men. Thank you. :D
kushi indiski
Kuthi
