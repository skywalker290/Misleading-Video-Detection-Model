Ooh, it&#39;s a tornado! Let&#39;s all go and look out of the window.
I feel bad for that canyon blue southwest
I love the caption.  &quot;I started to tape...&quot;  times have uh changed lol
Omg I was in the airport that was awful I live here
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgbYdnL6e8Q&amp;t=23">0:23</a> when he said What’s happening here? In that funny voice, that had me laughing so hard <br><br>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgbYdnL6e8Q&amp;t=133">2:13</a> that lightning and that cloud looked scary
I’m glad it didn’t hit directly (I mean, it didn’t…did it? 😰) Would have been chaotic as heck…
,😮😮😮😮😮😮
Just came from the video taken from behind this guy where all the comments are like why are these people up against the windows filming in a tornado...? 😒
It not funny when a Tornado hits.  The airport could be destroyed if it a direct hit by tornado.
A pior coisa do mundo é você está no Aeroporto e vem um Tornado que arranca tudo. Telhado levanta carro contener, derruba casas telhado arranca árvore e a única saída é orar : 10 Oração do Pai Nosso que o temporal vai embora as mil. Amém
People are way scarier than the tornado.
I seen the tornado on the weather channel and I was super young too in the storm happened to travel upwards after it hit St Louis I&#39;m glad the storm died out when it did though when it was traveling upwards towards me
Why did people walk away from the window?
Everyone is laughing and taking it all in stride. I&#39;m the one somebody has to slap because I&#39;m screaming hysterically. I won&#39;t even go  anywhere near Tornado Alley. Nope. Not me.
Mr. Conductor: Get us the blazes out of here!
I was on a plane to this airport and got routed to KC after circling 45 minutes. We couldn&#39;t get a ride or cab to STL...it was so crazy these guys were yelling and screaming at us for not going in on their 400 cab rides!
Bro where is the tornado even at i can&#39;t see it
&quot;I knew it was a tornado, man!&quot; Lol with his face up to the window until they were yelled at to move...ok!
The people are incredibly annoying
Ok so it took some guy yelling &quot; get out &quot; before the sheeple  moved !! They had their noses up to the glass Window right before. How dumb can you get ! Reminds me of the old western movies and the famous line &quot; get down they&#39;re shooting&quot; ! Duh !!!
the people whos luggage was in that plane😐
People are way too calm, I would&#39;ve been acting an ass. Not proud of that fact, but I know me, and I&#39;m trying to live.
I was on the south on that Good Friday when all of this was happening
Back when people weren&#39;t sheep wearing face diapers
“What’s your favorite movie?”<br>Me: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgbYdnL6e8Q&amp;t=3">0:03</a>
Oh it’s the YO GET OUT guy from that other video
Hey women who chose to scream when it gets windy; what the fuck is wrong with you?
bro thats looks like nick eh 30
Who else was thinking why are you by the windows?
Really?  Why on earth would you fly in tornadic weather when it could crash from wind shear😱🌪🌪
I wasn’t in the airport when this happened but, we were hit pretty hard in Evansville, IN. It was crazy. The house I was staying in was damaged by the tornado that hit STL airport that day.
Looks like a regular thunderstorm to me
That is our airline logo
The weather national service in st Louis should have issued a tornado warning
Man on camera: we&#39;re going to be here all night<br>Tornado: how about a direct flight?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg">https://youtu.be/Ndk1d5lSUNg</a> i think this guy uploaded the video, he was in the same airport as you.
The pandemonium leads me to believe the majority didn’t grow up around tornadoes.
in the distance...&quot;the plane could EXPLODE!!!&quot; lol
Can you send me pictures of the plane
Southwest Flight 10 now arriving at Gate E6.....E5.....E4.....E3.....E2.....Now arriving in Terminal C.....Gate C50.....Gate C49.....
your a badass for keeping your composure and not flipping your shit!
I&#39;m pretty sure I saw someone eating a burger at burger king idk if it is or its just me
&quot;The plane&#39;s gonna explode&quot;<br><br><b>That&#39;s just plane stupid.</b>
<b>OMGS GOD I HOPE ALL OF U ARE OK!</b>
Anyone ever heard of heading for the nearest airport tornado shelter???
The airport windows are designed to handle jet blast but would not count on them to handle an EF 5
Evacuated?! Don’t send them outside!!!!
Word is, we&#39;re still finding shit belonging to people just floating down the Mississippi river. Thank you for your contribution. I hope you enjoyed your stay.
There was another person filming already at the gate when you were evacuating.
People running out of the airport burger king and ect like &#39;fricking grab your chicken nuggets and run&#39;
why are people so afraid of tornado&#39;s all it&#39;s going to do is kill you there&#39;s no harm in that LOL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My home town St.Louis. The storms there ain&#39;t no joke, storms are rough.
Is very scary in STL with a siren and a tornado watch for St Louis
Hopefully the SWA flightcrew evacuated safely.
I’m the lady who remembered to grab the beer.
This is my airport
I&#39;ve watched 3 videos of this tornado and all I know is that there&#39;s a guy name George
Scary😱
&quot;I knew it was a tornado, it&#39;s st.louis.&quot; he&#39;s so damn right
That airport is all windows.
...omg...heavy rain, lightening, and strong ass winds capable of tearing through almost everything. What could it be!?!? ....ugh...a freaking Tornado maybe? Get away from the Windows.
hehee hehee
When the plane is like, Guys! Don&#39;t leave without me!!
I hope the flight crews were ok and not on those planes...
So there was a tornado? I just saw ppl trying to get away. I thought I was going to see a tornado. Clickbait.
&quot;Your journeys just beginning&quot; xD
the people in the US are...the greatest 2012 Hollywood actors for any Time😂😂😂😂😂
Crazy
People were like &quot;I&#39;m just gonna stand by these windows while theres a gigantic tornado outside, knowing the fact that these could break at any second and possibly kill me, no big deal.&quot;
Wait<br>Is The Tornado Named Lambert?
Hey look at that plane we will be here for days (looks at spiral cloud) hmf (people scream get downstairs) haha there&#39;s a tornado
everyone:is that a viking out there<br>viking:FUS RO DAH<br><b>glass shatters</b><br><b>everyone near the windows flew across the lobby</b>
why was everyone that close to the window 😔retards<br>everyone:lets stand as close to window so we can get impaled by the larges pieces of glass shards
What you expect &quot; now everybody plz line up in a orderly fashion way&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>Reality &quot; everybody run!!!! (People screaming in the background )
right were the other guy was filming!!!
omg
&quot;I knew, i knew it was a tornado man, I knew&quot; THEN WHY THE HELL were you just standing/sitting there watching instead of taking shelter? Knew my ass. LMAO
That was just a warning from God. People need to stop defying His Words or He will start taking lives with them.
People yet talk while there&#39;s a tornado <br><br>People:walks to exit<br>Smart people:runs to a safe place
I hope the people on the plane were ok. (I didn&#39;t know if there was anyone on)
&quot;The plane can explode!&quot;<br><br>Why the fuck would you say that with people already panicking around you? Do you want to start a stampede or something?
would have been interesting to see the plane move... ah well... o-o
Were any ground crew working outside?
panic room
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgbYdnL6e8Q&amp;t=121">2:01</a> there is a lady drinking Starbucks while there is a fucking tornado over her head! I would have thrown that cup and ran, like, &quot; Bye Felicia!&quot; lol
I live close to St. Louis. It was one Wednesday afternoon and I was about to go to the library. My dad told me to stay because there was a storm coming. I&#39;m glad that I listened to him because the wind started picking up and that&#39;s when stuff got very serious. I ran down into the basement freaking out. My family stayed by the back door watching the storm. The winds were so strong that a big tree fell over onto my neighbor&#39;s shed and broke the power lines down into our yard. Though it wasn&#39;t a tornado it was close enough!
Hey look a tornado. Let&#39;s stand right in front of these large windows.
well you should need to down
😶
:D
&quot; THANK THE HEAVENS! &quot; Within all the time it took for everyone to get to the lower level, they would have been killed had it been worse.
A flight attendant that&#39;s inside the plane. &#39;Another day, another flight&#39; * realizes that there&#39;s a tornado right outside &#39;HOLY FUCK!! GET ME OUTTA HERE!!&#39;
did anyone fall from the gate when the plane moved
O:04 &quot;hoe bai&quot;

What happend to ur luggage 🙀
&quot;We&#39;re all being evacuated here.&quot; WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU LEAVE THE AIRPORT???
Southwest airlines flight 302 will be delayed until further notice...
I have tornado warning at my school
It&#39;s like a movie
&quot;Men, women and children?&quot; Soo...everyone?
&quot;I would like all the people boarding Dorothy Airlines Flight 24 to line up at gate E12&quot;
OMG!!!!!😱😱 Is the plane ok??
That looks fun!
But they survived, the gates did not
Dude, there was people in some of the c gates that were there when the tornado hit and the plane was damaged and the glass was broken, they weren&#39;t warned in time
Your journey is just beginning...dun dun duuuun!
....................i did not see the tornado that sucks I wanted to see the tornado.
Like herding cattle...
Why is everybody chuckling about it? and they seemed extremely slow moving, without a care in the world. I be terrified!
99% of teenagers would cry if Justin beiber  jump of a building but 1% of me will say do a backflip!!!!!!!
when everyone screaming and running I was be like WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
We&#39;re ded thow if we get a little tornado what&#39;s a dust devil
I live in St. Louis
I saw other people who recorded the incident but he is behind you
&quot;Toll charge&quot; LOL! 😂 the ending tho 
I  have   to  Ian  <br>
&quot;Man, I knew it was a tornado.&quot;.... No you didn&#39;t
I love St Louis!! Been there twice♥
Dude i think behind you there was another guy recording he uploaded a video
Yup they rushed they assed out of there before they demanded refunds..
That&#39;s pretty scary..
I want to be a storm chaser but living in Michigan you don&#39;t see too many tornadoes
I was right next to you
Omg!!
You can claim your baggage at baggage claim C. And the woods about a mile west of the airport. And the river to the west of the woods.😊
Someone else was filming that day 2
Please message me about using your video for a Weather Channel series. thanks!
Dorothy airlines, sponsored by Oz 
I feel sry for all these people who has to live in places that have tornados
1)<br>UP/SUBSKRYCE.
dun dun dun (Leopold screams)
Who needs an airplane, you can fly in a house with a dog like Dorothy
&quot; Toll charge&quot; at the end waaaat
Wouldn&#39;t aircraft control ie: the highest point at the airport say something like &quot;Hey there&#39;s a f*in tornado on the runway, might wanna get away from the glass&quot;. It seems there was no control from airport staff 
Jayipatel was recording at the same time
What I don&#39;t get was why don&#39;t they have restrooms in the terminal for tornado shelters like what the Oklahoma city airport has? 
why is he outside???
Seriously, how did you remain so calm? 
I still hate how they didnt even try to keep people calm... they just scream GET OUT
Just casually take a sip of my Starbucks drink. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a tornado anywhere! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgbYdnL6e8Q&amp;t=123">2:03</a>
That person your talking to sounds black no offense not trying to be rasict I&#39;m not
Who needs to fly on an airplane when you got a Tornado like Dorothy?
i watched the other one mostly there the same!
what was that at the end? sounded like a gps voice saying &#39;toll charge&#39;
Love to come during a storm &lt;3 sounds fun!
Hi, check your inbox, got great proposition for your video. Message me when you get this. Thanks
Did someone really say &quot;the plane&#39;s gonna explode&quot;?<br><br>Do these people not know how tornadoes work????
heym like ?? why did the ? roof come off ? in my sight .. the nadoo should take that off and all the umm people would be great danger along with the glass there ..ughh great videoo !
Who else heard Siri at the end of the video
 There&#39;s always that one guy. &quot;Man, I knew it was a tornado!&quot; Then why is the man with the camera beating you to baggage claim? haha
I live in oklahoma, Typical stuff that i see every may
I grew up in St. Louis and this is so typical.  No one or nothing upsets people.  The mood here please note is almost jovial and despite this being an F-2 or F-3 but the time it hit the airfield (west of Lambert it was an F-4) not one person was killed nor seriously injured.
I find it hard to believe that I was in that same concourse last week
&quot;Everyone please move toward the exits in a calm, orderly manner....(crashing sound)....uh, screw it, just run!!&quot;
In an emergency like this...just use Siri!
They were.
Guess I better get used to it, since I&#39;m moving to St Louis in two weeks. East of the Appalachians we never get anything bigger than F2. 
You are free to move about the sky...
We don&#39;t, we&#39;re used to it. With me it&#39;s &quot;OUTTA MY WAY MY LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOURS!&quot;
Mainly because I have anxiety and have had it since I was about seven, so I don&#39;t do good in emergency situations.
Glinda the Good: You have killed the Wicked Witch of the East!&quot;
Pilot: &quot;Back in the plane, this is too cheesy!&quot; *Engine kills Glinda*
Pilot: &quot;Whoops!&quot;
theres an app for that.
they are scared 
Note to those of you who don&#39;t live in Tornado Alley. Don&#39;t just stand there and gawk at the pretty tornado. Those things will KILL YOU!! There&#39;s a reason we have sirens. 
I live in St.Louis and I was in Branson during the time.
&quot;This is your captain spealing we are about encouter some uhhh minor turbulence. Oh! And uh we have been diverted to the land of Oz.&quot;
Yes, the wings are full of jet fuel.  You won&#39;t want to be around if the plane happens to catapult through the glass or into anything close by.  Pure physics....
well the fact it can be pushed into the building and have a fuel tank ruptured than catch on fire.
I just realized 3 people who recorded it where here at the same time. Wierd
Go t Burger King
ive seen 3 videos now with that same guy saying &quot;get out!&quot;
1:32 tornado is gonna hit the airport
take escalater
We&#39;re ok we&#39;re all safe
A air plane blowen away WOW
i did not know that -.- 
0:35 The plane can explode?  Lol, winds ignite aircraft!  Pure physics
 There&#39;s always that one that says &quot;I knew it was a tornado!&quot;
It would suck if you were in the bathroom and you come out wtf where is everbody
Just to be a troll:
Shacking -----&gt; *Shaking

There are several bathrooms down on the lower level which would be perfect cover, but they didn&#39;t tell folks to go in there it seems :/
YOUR JOURNEY IS JUST BEGINNING !! MUAWHAHAHA
this is the exact same tornado that is in 2 vids on youtube i saw u in the other vid i watched lol
WTF?! I just saw my uncle chris wth is he doing there?
were did you go
At least if you stay at the gates you will board first with nobody else on the plane!
he was going to safety i doubt he was thinking about pleasing you while he was filming so stop being such an ass dude
I am no Einstein, but if there is a Tornado Warning you are supposed to stay away from windows right? Yet, they are evacuating everyone, passing a terminal with more windows. Wouldn&#39;t the bathrooms be safer? That is what I was taught growing up.
Hawaii DELAYED 
Tokyo DELAYED
London DELAYED
Your life DELAYED


All of a sudden its night time

What freaks me out about this is I work over at Indianapolis International Airport.... aaaaand this particular airport looks very similar to ours.... I could not imagine if that happened over where I&#39;m at....
really ? :O
are you really complaining about the camera being shaky during a TORNADO!? what are you expecting him to do? sit there and hold the camera nice and steady while the airport gets obliterated around him?

just saw this on the history channel
at the airport it was EF2. One Mile West it was producing EF4 damage. Check out my channel for footage.
I love how this video is shot 20 meters from that video I just watched... /watch?v=EXmi2p4uSCc&amp;feature=related
&quot;I know your trying to get to safety but if your going to film then hold the camera still.&quot;

...

...

...
Shuddup

I&#39;m really surprised that there isnt an automatic alarm system for this!  You would think at an airport with all their weather information and radar that it would be an easy thing to do!

The evacuation was wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy to late.
Dude, he was in a situation that involved a tornado. Stop being selfish, and ungrateful. Like everyone else he was doing the best he could.
&quot;ok this isnt good we&#39;re guna be here all night&quot; And then he realizes it more than storm delays.. 
&quot;Okay, this isn&#39;t good, we&#39;re gonna be here all night.&quot;
--two seconds later--
&quot;Get out, get out!&quot;

Or, maybe we *won&#39;t* be here all night!
Good thing everyone got down to the lower level AFTER the tornado passed through.
@cinstlu thats how we work in the lou lol no one takes the weather seriously till its too late
@3034893118 
I won&#39;t comment on your use of the English language (shacking......like you in an earthquake...???), if you don&#39;t comment on what it is like being evacuated during a tornado......because i doubt you have experienced this.......
@NayburhoodSnipa What kind of comment was that was that a rude comment or a comment that u did not know what i was talking about comment?
@3034893118 wow really?
i cant see the what happening stop shacking the camera. No wonder you get such bad reviews all the time its because you shake the camera to much not letting anyone seeing whats going on. I know your trying to get to safety but if your going to film then hold the camera still. its like you in an earthquake or grandpa birthday party

I dont mind not a lot of weather, I would have yelled Screw you all!!! and ran to the bathroom! 
Too bad you couldn&#39;t get the plane moving that would have been awsome!
the brotha knew...he just KNEW it was sumthun!:D
thumbs up for the poster at 1:40 ur jorney is just beginging
Imagine if this happened when someone was going to go on their first flight they would probably never go on a plane again Thumbs up if you agree!!
that red and blue plane looked like our chicago midway plane
@ThEViBers95 same.
@cobbius lol!
what was that &quot;told george&quot; at the end?
0:23 lol
do u have a daughter or son?
because at 0:16 u went &quot;come on!&quot; and showed somebody&#39;s hair.
i want to experience a tornado at the airport i live in norway so i dont get to experience suck things but i would like to experience it becasue its kinda awsome when watching the tornado as longest you have a brain enough to keep distance away from it or else it would exiting or what peps:)?
I&#39;d stay in the terminal. I feel safe there.
&quot;The plane is gonna explode.&quot; what a dickhead that guy was to say that.
thank you buh bye...buh bye thanks for flying lambert airport...
@IIZODIIAC  does it really matter? there was an F4 tornado outside and your worried about a hat?
@diegodaudt haha :D that&#39;s a good one! &quot;YOUR JOURNEY IS JUST BEGINNING.&quot; Final Destination!!! 
@rlax106 im talking about &quot;weather&quot; not earthquakes . . . . . .  moron  &gt;.&gt;
I was there, two days ago, watching my brother leave with my niece, and I was standing at the escalators, watching their baggage get checked. I almost just burst into tears. 
I was waiting for a entire plane to come crashing in... sad for the views, great news for the people actually there
This video kinda reminds me of Cloverfield
Sheeple.  Pitiful.
lol the frickin plane moved i mean&#39; FLY OVERSIZE BIRDIE FLY! HAHA he URRAH for the teans on phones at 1:51
We do action. Seriously, check our videos out...
@PIlotrcm 
&quot;Carol Anne, stay out of the light!&quot;
@sethy200
Look out, my pants are on tight!&quot;
@PIlotrcm I think it was &quot;get out, go this way&quot;
What does he say @ 0:04, is it &quot;GET OUT, TORNADO&#39;S IN SIGHT!&quot;?
@adulby  Intimidation - they were warding off a low pressure system with a positive attitude.
at the end was thunder or lights from planesss??
Oh, Tornadus.
Dude the plane is flying away!!
Well no shit thats what planes do.. OH SHIT TORNADO!!!
@Proverbs31intraining somehow our government has the ability to create tornados at ease and send them wherever they wish? I really hope that&#39;s not what you were trying to say. The government doesn&#39;t control nature FFS
@FlyBoyDC10AA &quot;Get out.... get to baggage claim&quot;
I can&#39;t make out what the FA was shouting? get out something?
@Larsky1010 I know right, not the smartest design for mid-west weather. hahaha
Difficult to get away from possible glass shattering when the building is nearly all glass exterior walls!
f4 tornado. worst tornado to hit st. louis in 44 years, and no one died. Miracle. 
MOVE ALONG......NOTHING TO SEE HERE
why did they run toward the tornado?
cloverfield? 
so uhh any flights delayed?
I live in st. Louis we get too many tornados
Great...now the TSA is gonna start checking for tornados in our carry-on luggage now.  
I live in st Louis don&#39;t worry people are fine we just got a lot of damage.
@devilzfood well i cant move because im under 18 and live at home. trust me, once i can go to college i am getting the heck outa here
Looks like a movie.
00:47 Some lady says she&#39;s got beer. Sounds like a good plan
Lets see here.. Christians said Japan deserved the tsunami because they don&#39;t worship god.. So what, americans deserves this for?.. be american? 
Fun.
2012

As usual, people are posting dumbass comments.

The people in the terminal are not just stupidly staring at an approaching tornado without taking shelter. The funnel cloud of the tornado was NOT visible. All they can see is a thunderstorm.
@evenmorebetter It&#39;s called slang, and depending on where you live will determine how commonly it is used, I live in Texas and we say &quot;aint&quot;, &quot;fixin&quot; and &quot;ya&#39;ll&quot; and guess what, they&#39;re not really &quot;real&quot; words.
86 comments, 93 ratings, and 90,000 views, thats bullshit youtube stop messing with view counts
THAT STORM CELL WAS WEATHER MODIFIED VIA HAARP............
@JosephStalin11 ME TOOO!!!! SOCAL WEATHER FTW XD
I live in California where it is 70 degrees and Sunny!!
@dbtb99 uh you&#39;re forgetting about the western part of Missouri, we usually get around 40-50 tornadoes a year all around Kansas City so no, we get WAY more than 9 tornadoes a year. Think outside of the &quot;St.Louis is the only city in Missouri&quot; mindset.
@shananojuice12 How about instead of telling others not to move here, you just leave? I love it here and take offense to people who just sit around complaining on the internet about why they hate St Louis. If you aren&#39;t part of the solution, you&#39;re part of the problem. 
@gsv67 I get pissed off when people say &quot;There are other things going on in the world&quot; . Duh there is always something else going on and this tornado was a &quot;going on&quot; even though thousands of lives were not lost. If your so concerned about more devastating things happening then what are you doing to help people in that﻿ &quot;other&quot; situation. The Tsunami got attention for a whole week so why are u comparing this to the Tsunami which happened almost two months ago.

I get pissed off when people say &quot;There are other things going on in the world&quot; . Duh there is always something else going on and this tornado was a &quot;going on&quot;. If your so concerned about more devastating  things happening then what are you doing to help people in that &quot;other&quot; situation
I live in st Louis my house didn&#39;t get hit but my sisters dance teacher did her house is almost completely destroyed :( nobody move to st Louis there&#39;s crime everywhere, terrible weather, and its boring as crap.
@pbostley Lol just like in Airplane haha
@gsv67 to be quite honest, i think being on the national news for a few minutes one weekend is hardly &quot;getting all the attention.&quot; yea, this video sucks, and there are DEFINITELY some serious tragedies going on out there far more catastrophic than this one, but chill.I was in a vehicle that got lifted a foot off the ground and if you had even an inkling about how scary that shit is, you wouldn&#39;t be so crass.It was very serious, and extremely frightening for some of us.
@TomenGage1 Agree totally! 25,000 people die in a Tsunami in Japan, and a small wind through an airport gets all the attention!
That was dumb! I thought we were actually going to see some windows get blown to pieces, or maybe a tree come through the window, instead all we saw was a bunch of people going down an escalator.
Did I seriously hear some dumbfµck say the plane could explode? The ignorance of some people.
Tornado arriving at gate E18..  E17... E16...
@sTeadFasT96 They wouldn&#39;t have been able to see it until it was almost on top of them because it occured at night.
Missouri pride please?
@dbtb99 lol no we get way more then 9 a year.
@OmerPT well something could have happened to him!
@Soulself Irregardless is not a word, it&#39;s irrespective or regardless.
@Psychonaut2021 That guy has me LMAO.  

Oh the humanity!!!
crazy footage. think you actually got it on tape in those first 20 seconds. that wind is crazy. probably the outside of the tornado or just off to the side of it.
@dbtb99 WHAT?! Where the heck did you get this incorrect set of stastics. Missouri averages nearly 40 tornadoes a year and St Louis metro sees one with a frequency of about 1 every 3 years.
&quot;I knew it was a tornado man, I knew!!&quot;
It actually looked like a pretty good evacuation for as many people that were there.  Hat&#39;s off to everyone involved.  Yes, better safe than sorry.
In situation like these &quot;Better Be Safe....Then SORRY&quot;
ah tornados the one thing that harms planes that the TSA can&#39;t search...
Ummm...the average tornadoes per year in Missouri is right about 30....not 9. Irregardless your point is still true, above average season taking place. Incredible video by the way.
I live in Florissant , like right next to the airport . I was scared shitless when i heard it hit Lambert 
looks exciting
my uncle was supposed to fly that plan that moved but he got the stomach flu and couldn&#39;t go. Thank god!
Jesus, usually I don&#39;t even pay attention to news concerning tornadoes in STL.  I only heard about the airport getting messed up from someone not even living in missouri!
I was in Maryland Heights at the time - right near the airport. so scary!
Thanks for sharing!  Glad that you and everyone were not hurt!
Its allright its just Chuck Norris pissing !!!
&quot;I knew it was tornado man, I knew it!&quot;
Crazy that a Tornado actually hit the airport, of all places. Street behind my house is completely destroyed. Everyone in Bridgeton/Maryland Heights keep in your prayers! 
I miss living in the midwest
I live here too, near st louis
@dooderguy Missouri usually gets only about 9 tornadoes a year. So far this spring we have had about 20, and usually nothing bad ever hits St.Louis. We&#39;re the state with the fewest tornadoes in the midwest, but so far this spring its been really shitty.
Edit the scene from Airplane where the plane slams inro rhe window.
Thank you for sharing this.  It&#39;s just amazing.  This has not happened in St. Louis for as long as I&#39;ve been alive.
I&#39;m happy everyone is safe and okay.
I&#39;m glad everyone was safe.  Thanks for sharing.
Hey, there&#39;s a tornado outside! Lets all stand by the giant windows and stare dumfoundedly!
You said something about a &quot;first&quot; tornado experience...not from the midwest?  Also, with no trees around I&#39;m guessing some people didn&#39;trealize the full extent of the windspeeds outside?
Thanks for posting
thanks for shooting &amp; posting.  I just can&#39;t believe the people in charge of the airport didn&#39;t know what was coming so they could get people away from those windows.
This is a crazy video! It shows the chaos of the moment.  This is nuts!  I can&#39;t believe it pushed the Southwest 737 away from the jet bridge.
