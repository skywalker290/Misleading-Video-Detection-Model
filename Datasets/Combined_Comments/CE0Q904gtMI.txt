Damn! 😂
That super strong eagle was flying weird and sounded a lot like a hawk
The bird needs too be put down asap
%30 of the vid has the camera pointed down.
пиздец)
Wait what?
דילן אנחנו מתגעגעים אלייך
coming back to this in 2023 man, i remember when i first watched this and thought it was real. You guys are amazing at animating can tell you really paid attention in this. good job!
😆🤯😱😱(?_?)😅
Los links que puso en el video estan mal
damn we all really were convinced this was legit back in the day
This will give parents nightmares.
Tge the jeeper creeper 😂😂
OMG THE BAY WAS SNATCHED BY THE EAGLE 💀💀💀
😓scary
Eagle: oh dang, these things are chunky 😔
What a terrible cameraman
Omg the baby is flying
The sound effect of the eagle always gets me 😂😂😂
Hahaha wish this was real I’m going to hell
There are many tiny clues that this was computer generated, if you are knowledge about that kind of stuff. But the thing that tipped me off was the eagle&#39;s hunting behavior. When taking down prey larger than it&#39;s self, golden eagles don&#39;t try to fly away with it, instead they crush the spine of the animal with their massive claws. Actually they try to do this regardless, but even more so for the larger animals. They&#39;ll even fight on the ground if they miss the first time, rolling around with their quarry. They do this with freaking coyotes, and if food is scarce enough, farm animals and deer.
Kids are overrated
Definatly not real, Eagles only pray on animals smaller then them, children are not on there diet.<br>Just remember there are some animals that actually fight against the Eagles
Haha 😂 hilarious… that is good editing
Guy with camera: &quot;Aye Whtz thi fux fliisfjjfke? 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
It literally took that MORON of a dad 5 whole seconds to turn around. Damn idiot.
How scary@
this is walt jr<br><br><br><br>like if you get it
I&#39;m Sorry!  But Is It Just Me? Or Does This Baby Looks Like A CHUCKY DOLL Sitting On The Ground Like That??
I laughed my ass off when I first saw that. Especially when the guy exclaims &quot;Oh Shit&quot;. I knew it was a doctored video.
OH HE FLIES TO BE THE WINGS OF THE FLIGHTLESS
Yo this animation is super good 👍
my teacher made me and my class watch this video it was hilarious
Bye Billy!
Knew it was fake, Eagles are not that strong to carry away a 2 year old
Sad that for a whole year I thought this was real
Poor eagle, nearly got 2 week dinner
Didn&#39;t know Anakin was into falconry
🤣
F A K E !!!🙄👎👎

Thanks YouTube for removing dislikes

Saw a vid where a huge eagle grabbed a goat off a cliff ledge and tossed it off a 1000ft- it was apparently very Tender by the time it hit the ground from bouncing off all those rocks
Funny to know ‘oh shit!’ is the natural reaction no matter the language 🤣
so today we have video eagle atack 8 yo girls, maybe thit video real.
I&#39;m not sure who was worse, the mother or the camera man.🤔
Transcript for those curious:<br>Fr-En<br>« Hey, ton enfant est-il correct? »<br><i>”Hey, is your kid alright?”</i><br>« Ah ouais, mais t’a vu ça là? »<br><i>”Oh yeah, but did you see that?”</i><br>« Ah, ça va? Ah, non! »<br><i>”Hey, you ok? Oh, no!”</i><br>« Hey, il est où là, où là…? »<br><i>”Hey, where is he, where is he (the hawk)?”</i><br><b>Enfant pleure</b> <i>Child cries</i>
This is so fake... The eagle didn&#39;t use physics to maneuver, as the laws of physics dictates...
🤣😂
new way to regulate over population!
Actually took a couple of looks to see that the eagle isn&#39;t real but damn
Para los que vinieron por Dross. <b>El video es falso</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guoJUqc_Jtc">https://youtu.be/guoJUqc_Jtc</a><br><br>Me gusta los vídeos de dross pero no debería verificar la información que cómparte
헉..........
He almost didn&#39;t even notice...
This reminds me of Yubaba trying to fly when she&#39;s heavy. Long heavy swoops lol
That was hilarious  wish he got em
Cap
Holy shit, even now in 2022, it looks so real!<br><br><br>EDIT: NEVERMIND. it&#39;s the baby that&#39;s the CGI, not the eagle itself.
The baby was hiding weapons of mass destruction in on pocket, and oil in the other.
When Chariots of Fire starts playing 😂😂😂
That looked mythical.
Considering that golden eagles are known to try and pick up things that are heavier than them, I&#39;d say this video would&#39;ve had me fooled back in the day.
That kid drank some red bull
Oeeee les gars 6.     5 mr argaud tu coco
Had him off the ground and let go. Amazing how strong those birds are
Shit happens. With no bad intentions but somebody always has to pay
It sucks how people’s minds get carried away
If that golden eagle was successful and no one noticed how fast do you think they would have that park on lock down interrogating everyone?
Ye to khatarnaak hai
The reason I know it&#39;s made for fun is the fact that the eagle stops really fast without flapping much and the wingpatterns are wrong. But in the rest of the animation I&#39;d give it 5/5
Jesus ,    I thought it was real ! .
This almost happened to me as a kid there was a eagle circling us and tried once but mum was onto it
not many hoaxes wake up folks to the prey scape like this. Easily could have been real.
Thunderbirds are said to have picked up adults in Alaska and Washington state. Though rare. A woman dissapeared off of a mountain in Alaska shortly  after a thunderbird sighting.
This is an amazing hoax. Holy shit. I know it&#39;s fake an still can&#39;t spot the editing. and to think, this was done in 2012. Amazing
Vicky no me moleste al niño!!!!!
Very2 stupid parent
This one is still the GOAT
Give me the red flags on why its fake
and that&#39;s how the legend of Eagleboy was almost born
If the kid were half as young, it might have been lifted into the higher sky
Imagine a person from a 3rd world country came across this on the  internet and watched this thinking it&#39;s real and pass on the story, from one person to another
Camera man fucking sucks.
These people should be strung up and tortured for a week or so, the biggest problem in the world today is fake news .I wonder how many eagles have been killed since this video was MADE !!
Every parent&#39;s worst nightmare...animated (great job)
I know it&#39;s fake but when I first saw this years ago I was soooo upset! 🤦🏾‍♂️ I once saved a 4 yr old from a huge korso. I don&#39;t know where I got the strength from but I jumped that fence and threw dog around like a rag doll. I am so happy I did. Because I believe I save that kids life and his parents came out hysterical devastated we were all crying. They don&#39;t speak English but we are friends still. We hug, we have tea. And that was 17 yrs ago when I was a teen. Still friends 🤝🏾
The bird sound in slow motion with that song at the end killed me 😂<br>But it most be scary tho
And that background music though
Gotta say, I have known this was fake for years, but still watch it, because it is so good.
This is why idiots shouldn&#39;t be allowed around eagles.
wtf is music
I&#39;m sorry for your loss what happened to your kid,<br><br>That damn eagle
It could happen with a really big eagle and a small infant.
Baby’s diaper fool, to heavy to pick up
Im reading a story in school about an article called the camera does lie it explains that this vid is fake lol
Is he was a bit lighter he would have been gone
I&#39;m shocked that commenters finally knew that it&#39;s fake(commenter aren&#39;t know for knowing things,except me since I&#39;m obviously better than everyone else)these are facts.
Parents fault
Crazy part about this is if the baby weighed anything less than what he did it would’ve flew away with him.
Legends say that after some days that eagle picked up the same child again and they both are living happily since then....
Thanks goodness it wasn&#39;t a Pterodactyl ⚡︎
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE0Q904gtMI&amp;t=36">0:36</a>
Closest we&#39;ll ever get to a video of a Thunderbird...
The Eagle wouldn&#39;t of been able to just pick the kid up like that lmfao. Kid must only weigh like 5 pounds! Good thing its fake.
I wish it was real and the kid got lifted. How about that?
🤣🤣
*Eagle fails to snatch baby<br><br>This guy: &quot;Oh no...&quot; *proceeds a video about it with cheerful music
It fake
what if the bird actually got away though wtf
was that a baby
Funny how people just buy it when someone for attention starts to spreed the lie that this video is fake, and that they made the animation themselfe. And doing it without any evidence whatsoever. People seem to be so disconneted from nature that they have no idea how an eagle flies or what they are capable of.. Nothing is fake here. An eagle can lift a deer.
Fotomontage
you need to edit better
Fun fact: the eagle would need a 33 foot wingspan to even lift the baby if the baby is approximately 28 pounds since a golden eagle weights 14 pounds and needs a 7.5 foot wingspan to lift just its body weight so to lift the 28 pound baby and the 14 pound eagle the eagle would need a 33 foot wingspan
Sooooo fake it’s ridiculous 🥱🥱🥱
And the oscar for best sound effects in a short film goes to....
Eagle said come visit Mexico
I somehow believed it as there are real incident like this exists.<br><br>Great editing.
Hey, you don’t look like a rat or a cat. Yuck, you’re a human! 🤮
Barely flew
How much weight can a golden eagle lift?
If I was the child with 100 IQ I would first take the eye out and punch it in the heart then bite the legs

I only watched this on =3, so I was pleasantly surprised to know that the music was actually from the original video lol
Eagle. I’m going to get you kid!<br>Kid. No!! <br>Eagle. Yes!<br>Kid. Oh my god!<br>Eagle. I got you!<br>Kid. Help me!<br>Eagle oh no I dropped him!<br>Kid. cries
The person who edit this song in the end is an asshole that kid could’ve been snatched into the air
That’s   So bad
This is fake? Dislike
I thought it was real for some point
they bad parents situation could have been avoided in several differnt ways
At first glance I thought it was real but through some digging it&#39;s actually just an animation. Props to the guy for making it look real.
FAAAAAAAKE AF!
the people who liked this are evil pieces of shit
Golden Eagle: that looks like a baby. Come here kid im gonna eat ya! Im bigger than you, im hiring a food chain. Get im my belly!! Come on! <br><b>*Baby escapes*</b><br>Also Eagle: you are a luckily Man.
That can&#39;t be fake.
Am I the only one surprised this is from 2012...... I can’t believe how I’m ageing
fucking eagle!!!!!
Oh no
DANG IT I DIDNT GET HIM he was to fat and heavy
So eagles kidnapping too 2021 is changing everything
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAAAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHA too bad the eagle didn’t get a meal
People are so sure it’s fake. Sure, it could be fake, but eagles have been known to attack human children. It doesn’t happen often but has happened
Yoink
I kinda wanna see this happen irl now even though I know it&#39;s fake
boy he said why the golden eagle snatches me
I want to see the baby expression on crying i want know his expression soo comedy hahaha 😂😂😂😂.
“Oh shit “only that you can do ?
I guess people do sacrifice their kids for fame.
Kidnap
If this was a real that kid would have already been dead that the eagle would have had his claws buried in the back of his neck
Eagles are terrible
Why is the slow-mo SOOO FUNNY :D
The war between us and the birds is really heating up.
I cried to this as a kid idk y right now 😂
ちゃんと赤ちゃんの近くにいろ！反応が遅えよ。
What state was this in?
Imagine an eagle saved a kid from a lion(and it worked like this)
Great animation, looks so real without careful analysis.
kid enjoys flying (:
Hawk: Heh heh heh heh... Looks like I&#39;ll be adding something PC to my menu! (Grabs toddler) Damn, this thing&#39;s heavy... (Notices his dad approaching) Uh-oh. (drops toddler)
apparently this inspired detective heart of america
LOL
That&#39;s not even funny. No.
Would of sucked, that golden eagal could of took him but the adults stopped him.
ALLES ECHT
imagine when the eagle eat the kid alive up in the tree
I held it together until the music hit. Omg I know I shouldn&#39;t be laughing this hard at this, but hot damn if this ain&#39;t the dammedest thing. 🤣
If the eagle could pick up the child doesn’t that mean humans could be capable of flight with wings
This was not ainmated

I can’t be the only one who wanted the eagle to fly away with him right¿?
Hiii
That was funny
It’s not possible for a golden eagle to carry a child unless they have about 25feet wingspan which is t possible lmao it’s fake
&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&quot;
The strongest and fiercest bird is the unrivaled golden eagle🦅✔✅✔✅🦅
That kid is going to grow up and learn about eagles and his teachers are going to wonder why he is screaming

Poor eagle, no lunch today :(
yo, ca vient de chez nous en plus wow!
Thats why we should be able to murder these fucking predators. It ridiculous the the fucking POS U.S. government cares more about a damn bird because its the &quot;coat of arms&quot; than a human being.
I hope the child, who must be 7 or 8 by now,  can laugh at this and is doing well.
I bet the fact that this is a hoax video is a lie. <br><br>They lied and said it was fake to appease the eagles.

this is a film project of nice students. but from a teacher that piece had to be a viral video.

💀💀💀
This is a fake -- nternet sleuths pointed out that there had been no local news coverage of the story bar that on the video, and perhaps more importantly when slowed down the eagle’s shadow seems to appear from nowhere, as though it had been left out of a couple of frames.
any one from Lawrence Snyder - Fluency with information technology :)
I did not expecting that.
FAAKE

make more
poor kid
Video may be a hoax but that<br>is not to say large birds of prey <br>dont try.  I had same kind of bird<br>(Golden Eagle) fly by us, turn around<br>and swoop down to my two year old,<br>I got to my kid first and the eagle <br>aborted.  The hit alone could kill<br>a two year old, if grabbed by head<br>and claws go in eye sockets.<br> Dont under estimate large birds,<br>They&#39;ve been known to attack pets,<br>even small goats, and if they can&#39;t <br>take &#39;em to go, may try to eat them <br>right there.
That eagle was nearly strong enough to take the child away and eat it.
Remember when this was all around the news
да нихуя это не фейк

I&#39;m only 9 and I can tell that this video is Fake
I wish it was real and the eagle took the kid up a mountain and raised him as an eagle. Then we&#39;ll make him fight against the kid raised by wolf to see who is the pound for pound best feral kid of all time...
It&#39;s too bad it&#39;s fake. I bloody hate children

You could be all proud and say it&#39;s FAKE...but I remember the first time I saw it I fell for it! And to think this went mega viral, is because millions of others did. This fake totally WON. The exposure it gave these guys.Damn. I remember showing my friends at work and we all thought it was real. Then I had to break the news and say it&#39;s fake! Haha...classic video this is.

This is fake the skit
Big eagles can snatch little kids and babies.  My mother used to tell that there have been instances were an eagle would swoop down and snatch a baby that the mother has put outside the house in the garden to soak in the sun.  I do not no which species of eagle that is though.  I&#39;m of nepalese origin so could be some mountain eagle?

The video may be fake but a golden eagle is definitely capable of carrying a toddler if it wanted to.
Im not even mad that this video is a fake. Its an EXTREMELY good fake on blockbuster movie level. Good job.

It&#39;s fake people. Scientist have tied 8 pound rocks to the talons on Golden Eagles,and they couldn&#39;t budge them. The fear of an eagle flying off with your child is unfounded. Relax

Just being honest can you make this any more fake
Just being honest can you make this any more fake
Now look as the bird flys magesticly in the sky ... oh wait oh shit ITS GETTING THE FUCKING KID
Annnnd that&#39;s why we should promote obesity! Weight wins!
Good fake!  Nice 3D rendering.
the eagle didn&#39;t screech as it was swooping down the first time  what was that but it did on the replay(when the music was playing) huh..?? insert cocked eyebrows /confused emoticon here : ..??
THIS IS FAKE FOR A SPLIT SECOND PART OF THE EAGLES WING DISAPPEARS!!!Plus the kid hovers in mid air when the eagle lets go?! And why did the eagles shadow just poof up that&#39;s not possible!!!!!!!!!!
Wonder how many people think it&#39;s real?
That is freakin scary
it happened irl today
SPONSER EAGLE
It&#39;s fake
Lmao so fake.
very well done
Poor baby... Good thing Eagle realized he was too heavy and dropped him. I have literally (no joke whatsoever) seen a bald eagle pick up a Chihuahua and carry him away for probably 200 feet before dropping and injuring him. It was so sad. They will eat anything that they think they can carry away. They usually catch mice and rats and such though. NOT KIDS! People don&#39;t realize it, but I have seen a dead eagle adult up close. They are HUGE and have great big talons that are used to easily grip and hold onto prey. Even slippery stuff like fish. Alaskan Eagles pick up and fly away with 10 pound salmon easily in my home state of Alaska. They literally could pick up a toddler like that if they thought that they were edible prey. (which thy probably could be... sadly)
VERY LUCKY!
EVERYONE MAKE THIS A TREND! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pizzabird">#PizzaBird</a>
Amazing that people thought this was real. The bird stayed in the same angle the entire time
FYI, the eagle and the kid are both computer generated animation.
You do know this is fake right
Gonna fly like an eagle... Let my spirit carry me!
This is one of the reasons I want to understand what animals are thinking
In real life the eagle would have done a lot more damage..they dont let go so easily. They are fierce.
I was thinking I believe I can fly
こわ
OMG the music is the best part!
The baby positioned himself for the fall perfectly.
Wait ! That&#39;s our bird.
Golden Eagles are assholes.
fake or not the music at the end is hillarious

Good job on the A in your class. XKCD for the win!
thats 100% persent fake people don&#39;t you see the it was made by a student do you realize thats just fake but if you think its real then your brains are dumb down.
wtf
The “Golden Eagle Snatches Kid” video, uploaded to YouTube on the <br>evening of December 18, was made by Normand Archambault, Loïc Mireault <br>and Félix Marquis-Poulin, students at Centre NAD, in the production <br>simulation workshop class of the Bachelors degree in 3D Animation and <br>Digital Design.
While the shadow is very good the kid floats upward for a few seconds XD
BS
canada !!!
those students are geniuses
That eagle didn&#39;t know it may make his whole specy endangered. The animal it was preying on is the boss of planet earth.
fake

Fake the kid is floating for 2 secs
THIS IS FAKE
First part is so mean, but when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE0Q904gtMI&amp;t=30">0:30</a> comes it&#39;s HILARIOUS!
I wonder if that kid is afraid of birds today.
This video is fake!

That&#39;s a doll
Congrats on 44 million+ views though!
Wow 44 million + views and it still has less likes than a pewdiepie video
eagle says,       TOWING CAPACITY,                    EXCEEDED !!!!
Oh I see how this is fake; The kid doesn&#39;t cry even after being dropped by the eagle, hat still on the same way, only cries when the man with camera reaches  him making noise. Those 3 students who made this video this deserve a 100% in that 3D exam.
Oooh my Gosh.Suppose the child was alone???
fake
Dat kiddo must have shitted in his pants when da eagle grabbed it. So it stinked and da MLG eagle decided:&quot;I&#39;m not eating shit like this for breakfast!&quot;

Hun

Fake
que pedo fue eso

Jesus I wish the eagle actually took the kid all the way, damn so close!!!

Nep nep nep nep

this fake ..look caught on camera
aaah...natural selection..
Song name is Darude Sandstorm
THIS IS NOT FUCKING FUNNY!!!!!!!!
i think it was baby what do you think guys?
Wow what a stupid reaction. I feel sorry for those who think this is real like seriously if that was real that guy with the camera would be screaming his head off seeing someone die before his eyes and the parents wow I can&#39;t even imagine how they would react to there baby flying away
False and homosexual
I would think by now everyone would know that this is a total fake.  It has been circulating for years!  First of all it isn&#39;t an eagle, secondly you can tell the kid is a &quot;dummy&quot; (probably stuffed clothing), third eagles can only pick up and carry half their weight, which would only be about 4 - 7 pounds.    You can check it out on Snopes for more information on who made the clip, etc.  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/eaglegrab.asp">http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/eaglegrab.asp</a>
44+ Million veiws, while Pewdiepie&#39;s most popular video has gotten over 60+ M veiws. <br>Still better videos than Pewdiepie&#39;s.
This one ate too many cheeseburgers<br><br>*drop
Still don&#39;t sounds fake.<br><br>The shadow moves correctly. This video is real, I guess<br><br>The eagle is real, what she&#39;s doing so low ?<br><br>I don&#39;t know guys, I think is true
A condor swooped down and snatched a lady&#39;s dog at a rest stop while he was still on a leash, whether fake or not, it&#39;s possible
I&#39;m here from =3
FAKE!!! I KNOW EAGLES AND THEY ARE NOT THAT EVIL!!! I LOVE EAGLES!!!
If that kid had a sturdier jacket on he was a goner... Fucking Canada, not even in a national park just chillin in the city.
no no no, that&#39;s not a hobbit.
I absolutely believe that it is real.  I have seen an eagle with my own eyes snatch a lamb that was bigger than that child and flew off with it up higher into the mountains.<br><br>You can find on YouTube a video of an eagle killing and eating a full grown deer in Siberia.
Faakkkkke Canadianssss r fakkkkke (this is a reference to a video btw )
in the first second you can a half of a wing disapers and in the slowmotion you see that the eagle isnt even holding the kid and the kid is flying after the eagle
Fake, made by students. The baby is auctually a doll.
Considering the kid was dropped, it must of been american. Since, you know... too heavy. <br><br>Yes, there are americans in Canada sometimes.
I wish eagles went extinct.
That took a turn!
fake and gay
HEY LOOK ITS THE EAGLE THAT RAISED GRAY.MANN
I&#39;m sorry but I laughed so hard at the slow motion vid
A fake video but surprisingly well done.
Salut au geek 💜
actually it&#39;s fake! just some students project
slg
Am I the only one who got here cuz of Ray?
This was made in a cegep in no Montreal called NAD they do video editing and 3d stuff 
I barely understood the Canadian french.
Super animation bien joué ^^
Because the Eagles just want the kids to have freedom.
OMG  I&#39;m so sorry little baby
Fake you can tell because the eagle is flying and when its wing is there then part of its wing disappears <br>
Its fake
Is it real or fake? Well.... slow it down and the wing will clearly glitch. And the baby drops after hovering in the air for a while. BUT THIS VIDEO WAS MEANT TO BE FOR A PROJECT.....
So fucking fake
I think this was a film student project to see who in the class gets the most views
good mythical morning brought me here :)
This was uploaded on Christina Aguilera&#39;s birthday!!!
yo les SLGiens !
Its fake i saw it on kids react thats alllllllllllll.
even if this really happy this would not be funny thats not good and not funny
in real life an eagle wouldn&#39;t dare get so close to snatch a baby with its parent very close by
c&#39;est dingue !!!
Hahah I found it funny<br>He pick the baby n droped it<br>N careless mom is like hawww my baby!
What the heck  is that
Really 12k subs for a school project
+Jason street you are right!
This video is so fake! Look at the back round!
A golden eagle can snatch a baby deer, no difference at all in weights..
Even if it is a fake, which it is, it&#39;s pretty simple to understand that an eagle might see a baby as a potential food source, manly because that baby is about the size of many of the animals golden eagles hunt. If this was real, I don&#39;t think the eagle would have dropped the baby.
Brilliant 10/10 most overrated video on YouTube. And now this comment will get deleted by someone I just know it. But seriously, I myself am immature at times but lol this is so Juvenile. Good at spawning memes though. 
Better we concentrate on more serious matters such as what is going on across the other side of our world with Isis be-headings. Just a question of time when we will be asked for our help and then, another war. No laughing matter about that possibility.
Fake sickening messages such as this should be banned. That is a scary situation no family member should endure since it is so very possible.
this never gets old
I remember when they announced that this video was fake on the news. But there are some interesting accounts of eagles pulling off extremely amazing feats on humans. Take the below accounts involving harpy eagles for example. Also, there is an account of a golden eagle killing a man. <br><br>It is said that if an eagle several times misses its stoop it becomes so angry that it will sometimes fly at a man. On one occasion an eagle swooped at its master because he was wearing a cap of fox fur. The eagle&#39;s talons pierced an artery and the man died. <br><br>This year, an American Harpy eagle was shot by a settler in the Southern states of America, and when he went to secure it, the attack it made on him was so furious that he had to retire to dress his wounds and go home for assistance, the bird receiving a charge of small shots before they could capture it, even in its wounded state. It was after all carried home apparently not much the worse for the two shots it had received. <br><br><br>Some years ago, a harpy eagle was shot in South America and considered dead, the natives pulled out the feathers and even the down, which they use in dressing wounds, and in this state the naked bird was thrown into the canoe, but all at once it sprang at the white man of the party, and wounded him so severly with its talons that it took 3 natives to take it off, and the unfortunate man was placed thoroughly hors de combat. <br><br>Hors de combat- out of action due to injury or damage.<br><br><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=w-4WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=imperial+eagle+attacks+dog&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kGwvPhmVOm&amp;sig=m11LJxoTapJhFfBYhDidX4pXXNs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3xAeVJOYNY-jyAS68YEw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=imperial%20eagle%20attacks%20dog&amp;f=false">http://books.google.com/books?id=w-4WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=imperial+eagle+attacks+dog&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kGwvPhmVOm&amp;sig=m11LJxoTapJhFfBYhDidX4pXXNs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3xAeVJOYNY-jyAS68YEw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=imperial%20eagle%20attacks%20dog&amp;f=false</a> <br><br>A Mexican miner before daybreak one morning in the mountains near Orizaba, surprised a pair of harpies and with a cudgel knocked down one of them which flew directly at his head. The miner now dispatched the bird as he thought, with a few well aimed whacks, and shouldering his game, resumed his journey toward the valley. Halfway down the mountain side he reached a steep cliff, and shifted his burden to his left shoulder, to use his right arm to a better advantage. But at the most critical moment of the most dangerous descent he suddenly felt the claws of the eagle at his neck, and in order to save himself, had to drop his stick which fell down the cliffs into the bed of a mountain torrent. Holding onto the bird with one hand he managed to reach the foot of the priciepie, where he siezed the struggling captive by the legs, and swinging it up, dashed its head against a rock, till its convulsions had ceased entirely. His arrival in the village with the story of his adventure created quite a sensation, but when the bird was deposited on the ground to be examined at liesure, it revived for a third time, struck its claws through the hand of its capture, struggled to its feet, and would have escaped after all if the enraged minor would have not flung himself upon it, seized a stone and hammered its head to a jelly. <br><br><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=aywDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=harpy+eagle+engages+in+mortal+combat+with+shepherd+dog&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Mis21edb93&amp;sig=ao--bPBn30NXXA_DXRC6tBrcMnM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=higeVNLgA4eyyATigoGoBQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=harpy%20eagle%20engages%20in%20mortal%20combat%20with%20shepherd%20dog&amp;f=false">http://books.google.com/books?id=aywDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=harpy+eagle+engages+in+mortal+combat+with+shepherd+dog&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Mis21edb93&amp;sig=ao--bPBn30NXXA_DXRC6tBrcMnM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=higeVNLgA4eyyATigoGoBQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=harpy%20eagle%20engages%20in%20mortal%20combat%20with%20shepherd%20dog&amp;f=false</a>

fucking bird have sent us to the bottom of the food chain
the abduction of ganymede, in the flesh

I saw it its on caught on camera so its fake you know that show caught on camera and you edit it and made the eagle and the baby
It&#39;s fake xD
Its fake. I saw it on the React.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE0Q904gtMI&amp;t=27">0:27</a> ..mom ..dafuq just happened ?
This viedo is fake!
This video is fake the creator came out in said it was fake. All it take is a simple Google search. However I watch them on tv debunk it and show how the video was made. Have you ever herd of the TV show &quot;caught on camera?&quot; Well that&#39;s where the creators of the video debunked it and told everyone it was fake. So  for you dumb asses who cannot think on their own and just search the dam Internet to see if it is fake... here you go
baby is not crying, yet crying sound was added. Bad move
MURICA F**K YEAH
It&#39;s because big things take small things away to eat and kill.
its fake because eagles dont just decid to snatch a baby 😡
Fake!  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/eaglegrab.asp">http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/eaglegrab.asp</a><br><br>But a convincing one!
i love the accent when he say oh shit
This video was actually made with CGI. There&#39;s a glitch in the wing at the start if you look closely and also the kid floats in midair for a while after being dropped if you look closely and pause it a lot.
fake
FAKE WHEN THE EAGLE DROPS THE KID THE KID HOVER IN MID AIR?! WTF
its fake
why why
....A few hundred years ago, there were much bigger birds of pray around, and children back then were carried off and with ease too! Check it out on Google The Haast&#39;s eagle this one went extinct around 1400 AD.
It can be fake BUT in my hometown Placetas, Cuba a boy was snatched by an eagle (?) in 1940, and dropped few meters away in front of family and neighbors who were stunned....and after that everyone called the boy the nickname &quot;Pajaro-prieto&quot;         
FAKE AS FUCK
What was the name of the song, by the way? :3
Guys! It says right on it it&#39;s a hoax!
You know, the thing about all these viral videos, is that people just &quot;happen&quot; to be randomly recording while something crazy but fake happens.
Its fake but a baby could be easy pickings for a hungry eagle, its just meat for its dinner to the eagle.
Shoulda called this video &quot;Babies can fly...proof!&quot;
This is actually a film school assignment i.e its fake.I found this out thanks to the fine bros.
Almost Ganymede.
Fake. if you notice in the background there is a unicorn
Lol
Poor kid
mon dieu sa fait peur ca
whats the music when the Eagle Took the Baby
Everyone says it&#39;s fake BUT it&#39;s very possible.  Golden eagles have been known to kill deer. Let that sink in. 
So fake. The reason why I liked this video was because I like it when animals kill and eat people. Too bad it was fake.
This has to be fake, there&#39;s no way. Why do stupid ppl make fake stuff like this. Smh
That was so crazy to see it I thought it was real but the second time no
If everyone thinks this is real it&#39;s fake the people who made the video were students they had to get over 100,000 views to get an A
Don&#39;t give a damn. I&#39;d break that things neck if it tried eating me.
guys watch caust on camera becase they showed this and this is fake
This is fake.  Well done to the students who created this video.  I just saw this on caught on camera
FAKE!!!!!!
Bahaha!! The chariots of fire song with the slow mo cracks me up.
Damn most views I&#39;ve ever seen on a video 
if your going to video tape well wold it up when your running not down
Good thing that is fake, poor baby. He was so scared, if that eagle really took the baby. His wife would be pissed at him big time.....
OMG! HOW COULD THEY DO THIS TO A BABY!!!! THIS IS SO ILLEGAL. SOMEONE GET THE POLICE!
thats not cool at all
Опять Путин виноват?)
hilariously FAKE BABy Plus it says HOAX in descry
joli fake alors :)
it&#39;s actually fake, they did this for a project at their school
Fake
Disinformation crap!
OMG a boy who could fly!!! 
Pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE0Q904gtMI&amp;t=3">00:03</a> and look at the eagle&#39;s wing if you don&#39;t believe it&#39;s fake.
FAKE FAKE FAKE
i kept laughing so much.<br> 
That is a really well done fake.
Fake. If you notice when the eagle lets go the child is hovering
It wouldn&#39;t be the first time humans have cashed in on bullshit
FAKE, FAKE, FAKE
Fake
Just one thing : this is not real. This is the final project of a student. Great FX from this guy !!!<br><br>Juste une chose : ce n&#39;est pas une vraie scène. C&#39;est juste le projet de fin d&#39;année d&#39;un étudiant en cinéma. Superbes effets spéciaux mec !!!
I called this video out as a fake the second I saw it... <br><br>It was supposedly shot on Mont Royal in Montreal, the weather clearly indicates that this was shot in mid fall but the footage was only released on Dec 18th. It’s an obvious fake for this reason alone. A stunning piece of viral footage would have most certainly been uploaded immediately, not 2 months later. There is no snow on the ground and the grass is still relatively green. There were no reports describing the event in the media at all prior to the YouTube release date.<br><br>The video editing is excellent but not perfect; there is a noticeable speed envelope mismatch in the flight of the eagle when it swoops around in the approaching arc. Its brief, but noticeable to a trained eye.<br><br>If the creators had pushed the release date to the following autumn it would have lent much more credibility to the footage.
that&#39;s horrible! the poor kid!
Your completely wrong. Babies are NOT nutritious. They are actually very high in fat and oily. I would not recommend dining on them very often if you want to keep your cholesterol numbers normal. Their thighs and brains are not so fatty. 
You could be all proud and say it&#39;s FAKE...but I remember the first time I saw it I fell for it! And to think this went mega viral, is because millions of others did. This fake totally WON. The exposure it gave these guys.Damn. I remember showing my friends at work and we all thought it was real. Then I had to break the news and say it&#39;s fake! Haha...classic video this is.
I laughed my ass off when the music came on
If an eagle was trying to steal that kid it probably deserved it. Fuckin anti Christ or some shit.
it&#39;s fake i watched kid react it is A TOTAL LIE! but good animation skill :D
It fake
It picked up a doll
&#39;Murica
Where the in the world did this happen? <br>That was crazy! 
Where the in the world did this happen? <br>That was crazy! 
This is hoax 
Awww poor baby
It&#39;s fake, BTW.
fake and gay
&#39;MURICA FUCK-YEAH!!!
The Haast Eagle of New Zealand really could do this!<br>No worries though, like so many other things, we humans have killed them all.
The baby was crying because he missed his chance of freedom.
Am I a bad person fir laughing
That deserves a &quot;World Record&quot; for??????
It is fake so don&#39;t kill eagles students did this for a 3D project I think
do tht again in HD
Nice to know &quot;oh shit&quot; is multilingual. 
Didnt look fake to me O.o wtf 
Did anyone realize that the eagle dropped the baby on his face?! D:
Even though the vid is fake, a scenario like that is possible. An eagle that size can kill animals bigger than that kid.
Its fake lol, this was a research project for a bunch of students.
Just watched a story telling how it&#39;s made
This song is not appropiate to this..
It&#39;s real guys, don&#39;t listen to anyone that tells you otherwise.
boi je moi
It would be nice to find out what kind of jobs they&#39;ve wound up with. Too bad you don&#39;t get paid for YouTube videos... Even a cent per click would be a nice haul at this point...
if this is fake its well done!
FAKE AND GAY!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ray William Johnson sent me here. fuck 
Golden Eagle: Wild wingspan 8 ft., Domesticated wingspan 9 ft. GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT!
Aw man too bad, it&#39;s a fake. I was hoping to find a bird big enough to take the wife... 
For all who believe, this is false and q is not really demonstrated is an assembly
Para todos quien lo creyeron, esto es falso ya demostraron q no es verdad es un montaje
Am I the only one who lol&#39;d?
Fake :P
That must hurt
Eagles are so cool.  Wonder if theyd like cats.  Mine keeps shitting on the carpet.
That&#39;s funny
Behold the power of video editing! Well done to all involved!
The real hoax is the story of this being a film project. There are far too many variables in this video that can&#39;t be duplicated by film makers even with the best software. The film project story is a cover.
Fake
delete i mean
does anyone know hot to delete a coment
now i kind of hate what i commented a few weeks a go

I seriously would have believed it if they didn&#39;t add the chariots of fire music at the end.
&#39;MERICA
Can easily tell its fake 
good choice of music lol
Jajajajaa esto  me dio fue risa 
wow my mom is gonna have a kid and this is what i have to worry about eagles!Thats messed up...
FAKE
Calm down to those who are thinking its real, IT&#39;S FAKE! It was a project for some students to make a video and if it the video got 100 000 views they got an A so calm down 
Nope, I&#39;m a small person, and now I&#39;m never going outside again. Thanks YouTube 
JE HURLEEEEEEEEEEEE AU FAKE !!!!
Fake
Guys its fake, it was an assignment for some Canadian film students.
Haast&#39;s eagles in Canada? I&#39;m gonna need a bigger birdhouse...
I thought this was funny, actually.
kid isn&#39;t even crying...fake or not that kid sounds like hes scarred for life
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s fake or not (the baby looks fake to me), but, a Golden Eagle is an absolutely massive bird that could easily fly off with a 10lb kid. People need to respect this predator because it could happen to someone&#39;s kid. These eagles have been documented killing and flying off with deer. Some people even use them to hunt coyotes and wolves. They&#39;re no joke.
great fake
Thank God the baby is too heavy for the eagle
This is fake btw
Fake im watching the caught on camera real or fake and it was a edited baby and a edited eagle.<br><br>
Awwwwww I know the baby was really fucking scared

Seriously, google it :p 
Lol its a fake but a very good done one
Its fake it&#39;s for a school project! It even said on the news and kids react!
Not a fake. How do you think it happened some robot bird or something?
WHAT THE HECK Did I just hear a happy song from the end when the eagle ALMOST get s the baby?
hey hey, that&#39;s my baby... lol
I guess no one reads video descriptions anymore? This was a hoax put together for a university class on viral videos.
Man, that&#39;s scary.
FAKE omg
There&#39;s also the South American condor that can do that too.But it the condor case it actually took the kid 

It&#39;s real. There used to be eagles that could snatch medium sized dogs like its nothing.
yeah its the parents fault that a fucking golden eagle decides it wants to eat their baby yeah okay dog.
the eagle is cgi
So much views
Ohhh noo this baby is so sweet
Guys it IS fake, this was made as a school project the assignment was to create a viral video and get at least x amount of views. These guys probably got an A
Clever
I was driving through ste dorothy&#39;sforest  laval residential area,saw last wednesday sept 4th , saw a golden eagles landing .. huge 3 foot bird with a wing span of like 6 feet. impressive view
Omg wth
Wow. Lucky sia the baby! What if like the baby have been taken away?! Siao!
Whale Ray William Johnson reviewed this video, it only had 18 million views, now it has 42 million
Turn your computer off. Idiot.
THRID: It says so in the f***ing description
that was fake
PROOF: FIRST,the baby was still flying even after the eagle left him. SECOND the eagle shadow appeared from no where.
It&#39;s a fake video, this didn&#39;t really  happen.  It was done by some students for their 3D animation class, they were promise a 100 on their project if they were able to get over 100,000 views on the video. 
The eagle should of tried a black van with the words &quot;Free Candy&quot; written on the sides.
LOL ? eagle: come on kid i&#39;ll bring you with me on disneyland
  kid: not today , i want my toy first ! 
          
the eagle dropped the kid feet from the ground!

I soooooo want to take this class.  A masterpiece  :-)   
Кто от Стаса, лайк!

fake
I saw a eagle swoop down on a 19 lb poodle...it&#39;s amazing what they will try when they have babies to feed and the hunting is convenient.
If a whole new world had played I would have died.
go and fuck yourself 
it&#39;s fake   pause it an look
Fred and Ciaran&#39;s podcast
WHY IS IRON MAN YELLING AT ME.
YOU JUST HAD TO GO AND ADD INSULT TO INJURY?!?!?!?
Haha, my apologies!
oh this was a hoax... then I have to ask, who kicked the Canadian baby? was it Kyle? and also was the baby&#39;s name Ike? (SOUTH PARK!!!)
honestly can&#39;t believe this is fake....Oh well, thats some awesome CGI there, if it can make u feel that it is real, then the effects must be really good
When did I say anything bad about Canada?? I replied to the idiot above me who THOUGHT this video taken in the US. Like holy shit, don&#39;t be so fucking defensive. 
Canada.. the best country in the world pal ;) Let me guess you&#39;re an American, lacking in education and from the south. 
nvm i just figuerd out it was fake
this is def not fake thats just crazy
Pidgeotto, fly me to another city!
good dad

1) you spelt virus wrong
2) fuck you youtube bot
1) you spelt &quot;virus&quot; wrong...
2) fuck you youtube bot
nuke+maya =)
not a fake
music makes it lol
god that is not good
i too xD 
Is this for real??
what video editing did they use caus its fake
Stop disliking it because it is fake, it was an assignment for crying out loud, they had to make it. It&#39;s only their fault it was that awesome.
Well, You used all caps, misspelled &quot;you&quot;, one of the most simple words in the English language, and used horrible grammar with the multiple question marks. Also, your name says &quot;Maya Malik&quot;, which means you are a One Direction fangirl, which is also a nono. Canada gave us Justin Bieber. That is all.
its a animation -.-
OhHHhhhh MyyyyyYyyyy GooOooooD 
Danm the views
Holy $&amp;@!
42,000,000 views... Holy shit.....
yes i mean it, this is really fantastic. Listen, i really didn&#39;t expect that this site would send me a check of $240 for doing some surveys. i got it from here. you can also try it: bit.ly\148ZdlP
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH
Fake Canadians aren&#39;t real.

Oh shit, bird taking my ki... this grass looks pretty.
That is written in the description.
faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake if seen it onthe news

ужас!!)))
This is not fake, I&#39;ve seen it with my OWN eyes ._.
that&#39;s right, i know alot of people who think it is fake. Listen to this, i&#39;ve been getting paid about $200 a week just for letting brands know what i prefer to buy. if you wanna try just try now: bit.ly\140m3ft
FAKE video -_-&#39;
Play it backwards and you have a stork.
Too bad about it being fake.  It&#39;s totally plausible.  A big golden eagle can carry off about 7-12 kilos.
やばっwwww
Very convincing video.
Um...what? I was correcting the guy above me because he thought the video took place in the US. Calm down and stop shaming your nation.
It&#39;s fake :/
STFU STOP BEING SO MEAN TO CANADA WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO U????????????????
Ok, done my research and see that they did in fact do 400 hours work to make this look &#39;real&#39;. What a waste of time. This does not negate the fact that Golden eagles are quite capable of eating human toddlers. I still love Golden Eagles though. 
If it&#39;s fake it&#39;s a very good job, and I am speaking as a fairly good CGI artist. Someone would have had to do a lot of work to make that look so real. Why would they do that. Look at the way that the shadow of the bird comes in so perfectly, the picking up and dropping of the child, not to mention making the whole thing look as if it&#39;s been taken on a cameraphone. 

fake
that&#39;d be amazing.
except this is Canada.
Hahahahahaha ha
looks like the bald eagle must have snatched one from Kenya instead :3
Fake.
