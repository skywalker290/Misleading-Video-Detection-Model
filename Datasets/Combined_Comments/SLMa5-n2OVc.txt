you go to a place where bears live without any protection. i.e. a gun of bear spray. however, you have your helmet on.
Saw  no bear
That was boring
I must have missed two of the three charges stated in the description......
That brake sounds like an animal in distress
Where did bear disappear?
If you are in bear county better pack a shotgun
Bro and the worst possible thing happens you crash your bicycle it&#39;s just like in the movies everyone falls in the near death experiences
I&#39;ve been told you can distract  an angry attacking grizzly that is protecting their young by throwing it a jar of honey. Or... shoot it with a Glock 15 times in a row.
Excuse me sir, you have a brown streak running up your back
Biker: whoo I need to catch my breath<br>Grizzly Bear: WHY IN THE WORLD DID YOU STOP!? KEEP GOING!
It&#39;s a bear spray is useful for bear?
If I lived somewhere that had bears in the wilderness I would NEVER go into the woods
This guy is known for posting fake videos lets get him banned
Nice fake video
moral of the story...don&#39;t go biking in the f🤬cking woods😑😒
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=32">0:32</a> Bro..
I am so glad you made it out okay. And you got killer footage as well. <br>The worst part is after, knowing it’s out there with you but not knowing where it is.
Plot twist: Bear was trying to ask if he could use your bicycle
The only way i ever go into bear country is with a hand cannon and bear spray. It’s why i never go into bear country. Lol
Fffaaaak that was  damn close!!! GTFO asap.
I thought he was gone for sure good thing the bear had other plans
I wanna believe this but theres so many fakes these days
Glad you’re safe brother.
This makes me hate even teddy bears L😂L
If a bear is charging at you at that point it doesn’t even matter what kind it is. The only difference is how quickly you will be mauled if it gets to you (and MAAAYYYYBE a slight chance of surviving if it’s a small bear)
That’s why you carry a pistol on you when you’re in the wilderness friend
I&#39;m the future when riding through bear country ride on a dirt bike cause that way you will be able to get away instead of running
Your dumb all you had to do was draw a circle in the gtound to drive it away like all seabears
CARRY A FIREARM MORON
🎶somewhere deep in bear countryyyyy🎶<br>lives the berenstain bear familyyyyy🎶they’re kinda furry around the torsoooo🎶they’re a lot like people only more so🎶
Maybe just stay away from the bears and leave them in peace
Click bait bitch
This is what happens when people go in savage nature like it is a picnic. It is a picnic. For the bears. And you are a lycra basket full of snacks. So, the bear goes like: eyes, lungs, pancreas.. So many snacks so little time.
Imagine if the bicycle tier pumcher at the same time
Thank God for that shrub. Totally outsmarted that bear.
Part of the ship part of the crew
and i thought me surfing with great whites in their hunting grounds at dusk and dawn high tides was sketchy for ten years. this is gnar
theres a lot of people making money from this on youtube. just saw it in a few bear videos and looked up the original
Me I&#39;d do what you did
Those dudes are funny.
Now imagine Quiet Place 1 &amp; 2 Monsters
I wish these damn bitch bears would get it through their head that most people, don&#39;t want to have anything to do with their ugly cubs. If they truly are scared then they should move their cubs far away from where the human/s are, I mean come on.
This is a shitty video because it&#39;s simply misleading,  At no point ever did I witness a Grizzly bear charging.  Thanks for wasting my time. ....... Just because a Bear sees you, doesn&#39;t mean it wants anything to do with you, so instead if being able to move faster and keep riding, you freaked out and just fell down the hill. I would have stayed on the bike lol 😄🤣😂
Everything is fun and games until you see a big ass bear runing towards you.
Not all that sure that the video is real. A glimpse of a bear. Possibly just click bait.

“After careening down the hill a bit on my bike, I was able to distance myself from the bear.”<br>You were able to do that because the bear stopped chasing you. You were lucky.
Would like to see the heart rate monitor on the screen 😂😂😂
I would have played dead. Yeah right! No way in hell.
Let’s see if running or biking in bear country can trigger their predatory instincts to chase fast moving objects
I hiked Jasper and Banff in the mid 70s......Mount Assiniboine ....we tried it.<br>.weather moved in ...lots of grizzly around
What’s he say after he falls?
These bears love them some bicycles
A . The sow had 2 Cubs with her and you should have hightailed it in the opposite direction once you realized that.<br>B.your lucky she didn’t give her kid’s a tutorial lesson on how to disembowel a human in three easy steps <br>C. Grizzlies, Brown’s, Kodiaks are nothing you want to trifle with.<br>D. Papa bear is waiting down the trail and you almost got bushwhacked!
The initial reaction is understandable but panicking and going off of the trail like that could have been a fatal mistake. Firstly because the rider could have easily broken his neck or another bone going down that slope on a bike. And secondly, if that injury would have incapacitated him the bear would have had a greater opportunity to injure him further. The dude up top on the trail played it cool and that&#39;s the ideal way to handle these situations. This is coming from a forest technician  with years of experience and innumerable wildlife encounters in the most remote areas of western Canada (including the area around Japser national park). If you are making enough noise in the forest, the probability of seeing a large animal approaches zero. Make yourself known and animals will make themselves scarce (for the most part). Bear spray is great but more often than not, people will spray themselves rather than the bear since the wind can blow the spray right back up in your face, especially in the case of a panicked reaction. In dozens of bear encounters, mostly black bears but definitely grizzlies too, I have never once deployed spray against a bear, although I always carry a can. If you plan to carry bear spray, get some practice actually spraying the can at a target, even if you waste a can in the process of learning. Stay safe in the woods and make sufficient noise. Cheers.
As a man you are responsible for the safety of the people around you. Traveling through bear country you should have a Glock 20 loaded with hardcast bullets.
Is that bear spray in your  hand?
Was watching intently with my phone right up near my face trying to spot where the bears were near the end when a loud add popped up and scared crap out of me 😂
Hahaha oooh shiiit
Dang that bear tried to steal his bike! What a dick.
Amateur, I would’ve done a u-turn then hopped on the bear and made it run into a tree then I would back flip off the bear and punch it in its eyes before round house kicking it off the mountain
Here there be bears.
🤣🤣😂🤭🤭🤭🤔😉🗣️🗣️🤟
Moral to this story? Stay out of bushes..
Does his friend yell “you’ve got to get your breaks fixed” ?
Was that two cubs at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=165">2:45</a> ?
I&#39;m okay without there being grizzly around.
Bear:  I want to talk to you about your lord and savior Jesus Christ.
Guns &gt; spray
That&#39;s probably the scariest thing I can imagine of encountering in North America. Grizzly mom with a cub. Well, maybe polar bear would be a bit scarier but still. Especially if they see you before you see them.
I would have done a blackflip and then zoom pass the bear matrix style. An then stab it in the heart with a butter knife.
He was coming like a locomotive, scary.
I don’t think I’d want to mountain bike through bear country. Good luck.
That was some guy dressed up as Ted..so obvious
Jasper National Park: We don&#39;t allow people to carry guns for the wild life.<br><br>Wild Life: King of the Jungle music.
I woulda did a backflip then zoom past the bear matrix style and blow it up with a bazooka.
No what to expect traveling through the damn woods on a fucking bike. Smh. I guess u want some excitement huh? Keep playing around in the woods like prey!!! Go ride where most people ride there bikes.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=161">2:41</a> did he say how&#39;s it going? And just stand calmly while being charged?
This is why im happy I live in New Zealand lol no dangerous predators or deadly venomous animals or reptiles in our wilderness
Is this Jasper Oregon?
FUCK YOU
FUCK YOU
Why did you go downhill?
Always carry bear spray with you..
This is the weirdest and most confusing comment section ever
Pola
Purchase a downhill bike next time 😅
I mean your in there territory idiots
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=25">0:25</a> you can see the bear standing at the top of the hill, kinda hard to keep your eyes peeled when your trying to stay on the trail. I think this guy did the only thing he could, Nice off road riding, probably kept you from becoming food.
This is alllllll false people
Guy almost kill’d his damn self
Fake
&quot;OH SHIT!&quot;
looked like the bear stopped and stood up... what a possible life changing moment though hey? dont ever play around with those and make sure to have safety gear for scenarios like this... no one is permitted the day of life....
I&#39;m glad you both were ok.
Still wants to tell a driver to share the road after delaying his day for twenty minutes
That went downhill quickly!
Couldn&#39;t hear the audio.  Those looked like black bears, definitely not Grizzlies!
Thanx for nothing
600 lbs of bear comin at ya, DOWNHILL? Oh god, what if it trips?
Crazy ..stay safe man.
А зачем вы там катаетесь на велосипеде? Вы из России, что ли?
This is a lesson folks - anytime you want to venture out like this, carry a bear gun.
🎶&quot;And it was just my imagination&quot;🎶
Don&#39;t mess with nature you will lose
Stay on the trail please.
There is an alarmingly large amount of bear charging videos on YT...
Wait. Wait. Wait. The guy’s friend stayed up on the path??!!!
Change your drawers then go tell the ranger.
Va bene trovarsi davanti un Grosso e feroce Grizzly.......ma se di fosse trovato davanti  uno di Forza Italia ???? Non bastava certo scappare...,
FAKE
Oh shit i might just jump to my death!
On another day, that ends badly. When he ditched and went down that embankment, I don&#39;t think you could but yourself in worse position. There would have been no way out if the bear had followed. Very lucky
Damn, go riding through those woods its just a matter of time till you get eaten by something.
Dude forget the bears look at the ancient stone monument you walked by on your way back up the hill..  definitely nan made ..., circular in the middle of nowhere... please call an archeologist <br>Have them review your footage..,<br>Maybe just a old well😐
Omg, that was scary, i experience that too here in cranbrook
The bear just wanted a bear(bare) back
Crazy Idiots !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Look at the fuccin SIZE OF THAT
I take my fat friends along when in bear country. Has anybody seen Johnny BTW?
He couldn&#39;t take it anymore your squeaky breaks were unBearable
I would definitely have a pistol at leat a 357mag....
I DID NOT mean to laugh as hard as I did when he first saw that bear but I am in tears crying laughing omg 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is fake
Bear: “we’ve been trying to reach you about your cars extended warranty”
Are those cubs running around at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=164">2:44</a>?
He did the right thing by going downhill, bears have trouble running down hill.
Wow
Rule #1 When in bear country don’t ride a bike with brakes that sounds like dying prey.
The more people invading their land. The more they will always attack. Stay in your place.
I feel like bears get aggressive and scared of bikers for the same reason dogs do. They see you moving but they don&#39;t understand how or why as your legs aren&#39;t in contact with the ground.
I&#39;d have a little grizzly cub in the back of my shorts after that
were those dogs?
He’s got that bear spray. And wow, what a tumble
Yogi!
Good to see you have your anti-head-getting-eaten protection on
The squeak of the bikes brakes sounded like a wounded animal attracting the bear 🐻 crazy !!!!
Legend has it he is still standing next to his bike waiting for the bear to leave.
When is the charge?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=181">3:01</a> those CHOMPERS!
Thaaat was intense!
Lol, Do you want to go back?&gt;&gt;&gt;Does a bear sh!t in the woods?!
They can outrun a human on all 4&#39;s uphill or down
Wow, poison oak much?
Ill never understand why people go into woods that bears roam ... With nothing but a bike
Excuse me  but did I miss something  here. Where&#39;s the charge?
In the initial moments it looked more scary than Blair Witch project.
What are his balls made of and where are they?
This happens all the time with mountain bikers and bears, in many states. I&#39;m not sure why one could not wear some kind of a whistling device on the helmet to give these animals some warning that these humans are coming down the trail.
If u slow it down he sounds like one of the drunk guys on live PD
Godam tho man....why do all you people have that bullshit ass mase on you....if the bear is fully charging there going to run through the fukkin mase an attack you. Ya it might FUKK them up a sec..but not honestly it ONLY HELPS IF YOUR LUCKY &amp; THATS AFTER YOUR ALREADY ATTACKED. BRING GUN
That has to be the scariest craziest moment in the world other that being In the ocean &amp; attacked by a shark or sharks. Lol hope this man made it back home with 0 or little serious injuries. But like I said .....THATS WHY YOU GOTTA KEEP A GUN
Why you gotta disrespect Yogi like that.
So those were bear cubs playing and running? That&#39;s probably why momma charged.
How can you travel in bear country with no bear spray or nothing to defend your life with . I hope sight seeing is worth it . Ask grizzley man !
Let&#39;s go biking up and down the hills through grizzly infested forests.
Welp, you&#39;re on a game trail, it&#39;s just for hunting, hungry grizzlies instead of humans
Too bad he didn&#39;t get you.
Should be titled morons in Jasper
Bears will eat you alive. Ineffective killers they overpower you. Broken they drag you to wear the  tear you apart. Curious yet detached by their hunger. Alive piece by piece into that clumsy beasts belly you go..
Thats right. Run from it then sneak up behind it.
A woman went into her local newspaper office to write the <br>obituary for her recently deceased husband. The ad rep told her the fee <br>for a submitted obituary was $1 per word. <br><br>She paused, reflected, and <br>then said, &quot;Well, then, let it read, &#39;Billy Bob died.&#39; &quot;<br><br>&quot;Sorry, ma&#39;am, replied the  editor, &quot;but I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s a seven-word minimum on all submitted obituaries.&quot;<br><br>Flustered,<br> the woman thought for a minute and then instructed the ad rep to write,<br> &quot;Billy Bob died. 1983 pickup for sale.&quot;
In bear country without a 44 magnum!? U really can&#39;t fix stupid!
Did he send u a friend request and u refused it? That might explain the rage, I too have felt that rage...
He just wants to ck out ur bike u monster!
LMBO Erin
It&#39;s just a Drop Bear
Get out of their world. Real simple 😎
Hell , looks like &quot;meals on wheels&quot; for Yogi ! . . .
Wtf is bear spray? Bear spray back then was a shotgun in the bag and a .45 on my hip. Out west your in Grizzly country. Idk what they thought they would run into 🤦🏼‍♂️
If you step foot in the woods and don’t have a REAL solution for predators. You’re an idiot. Never ever do I step in the woods without a plan to survive anything that’s in there. Quit being idiots and protect yourself. It’s not a game out there.
Meals on wheels....
Dont rely on bear spray too much bro , Ive had them run right through it at full charge, its better than nothing though
This is why I mount two AR-15s onto my handlebars when I am riding in the woods.....Giggity goo!
The noise of his crappy brakes didn&#39;t help the situation
Your not going to outrun, outclimb, outswim, or jump over him. Might as well pepper spray and out bs him.
Should’ve had an E bike 🚲💨
There is almost nothing more dangerous than a mother grizzly bear protecting its cub. Those guys are lucky the mama was satisfied with a bluff charge.
What they waiting for bear to come back and eat them they must be watching to much jason and freddy 🎥
Just a false charge by the look, bears are deadly animals and are very hard to escape from if they mean to attack. Lucky enough this one didn&#39;t.
His Bike Brakes sounded like a Wounded <a href="http://animal.it/">animal.It</a> Bought him in to go after him.
I&#39;d wouldn&#39;t of stopped at all
Idiot
Hahaha.
I just heard “OH SHIT” and could tell this was about to get interesting
Why not continue on path and make the bear change direction if con&#39;t to chase?? Why turn and go off path and in the same direction the bear was already travelling? Let me guess.... didnt have much time to think? lol
😳😳😳😳
if i was a hobbyist mountain hiker/cyclist i would carry a rifle or pistol of some sort so at least you know you can defend yourself or scare the bear away. let&#39;s face it you were at the mercy of the bear
Yeah those little bells let them know dinner is ready.
A bear makes a mountain biker 8x times faster
you can see him the ridge for split second at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=25">00:25</a>
If he didn’t look up 😳
Where&#39;s the goddamn bear guys
I&#39;m always like, &quot;how do people keep getting eaten in the woods? what the hell are they even doing in the woods???&quot;  now I see, they&#39;re riding bicycles.
How did it not run after him ?
GLOCK 20 with hard cast bullets.
nxt time activate the sharks w/laser beams on their heads.
I wonder if the sound of your brakes, that sounds similar to the wine of a young deer or yearling might have attracted the bear, LOL
Just a casual Saturday in Ambarino
This was actually a Russian bear that had mistaken the bike for a unicycle. This misunderstanding occurs far more often than you’d think
What a wimp. Let the bear you and take it like a man!
That was a close call
Why oh why would you venture out into bear country unarmed...
Hell to the fuck naw
Fuck i would never go biking in bear county. If i did I’ll bring bear spray, a shotgun a pistol and a grenade just in case that shit gets a hold on me im pulling the nade I’ll either kill it or take him down wite me
Next time carry the new Bear called 44 magnum. Best Bear spray made or even up grade to 500 mag or the awesome short barrel pump 12 gauge.
🚳🐾🐾👣
You&#39;re pretty lucky, you know... too have a grizzly charge ya... he could&#39;ve charged that credit card.... then you&#39;d be really screwed!!!!
I’m kinda surprised that if it was a mother and her Cubs that they didn’t die. They are literally suicidally protective of them.
Why put yourself in a situation where there is a possibility of getting attacked by a grizzly?  I wouldn’t go near those woods without some big guns and a few buddies with big guns.
С десяток килограммов потеряли в весе одномоментно...
Вообще не поримаю ...а зачем сразу в лес бежать в кусты увидев медведя????😂...нужно сразу газку поддать и вперед с горочки..!!!😂😂😂
Где звук?
😳
NO Glock ???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=136">2:16</a> if you look closely at the top left corner you can see the bear
Always remember you dont have to be faster than the bear just the person next to you.
The Bear afterwards: Thath wuth a prank HAW HAW HAW you dumb hooman.... HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW oh goth....
What did he say? You got to get your breakfast?
Wait was the bear meowing😂????
That&#39;s odd. Never seen the bear or a charge duh
It&#39;s CGI all day. Otherwise why jump off a BIKE and run...not to mention your bike lays there forever and you don&#39;t even think to get on it and high tail out of there?
The Jungle Book
Hehe Fast Food
You should never run from a bear, but if you must, running down hill is always the smartest. Humans can out run bears going down hill because a bears hind legs are longer than its front making it difficult for them to run very fast downhill.
The bear heard the bike and thought it was a cat meowing.
Hello ?  Please don’t ride around in wilderness / bear land , with brakes that SOND EXACTLY LIKE A WOUNDED SMALL ANIMAL ?   Can’t understand your inability to connect those dots.
Northwest Montana, getting ready to survey. Our grizzly orientation- don’t be the slowest one in your group.  Bear spray is a joke to a charging grizzly, run side hill. They are so large they have to serpentine on the steeps. That said, it only buys you a few more seconds of life. The SOB’s can run down a horse!
I would&#39;ve climbed a tree.
Ok someone needs tell Cashnasty to watch this video right here 💯
He said I will ride this bike off the fuckin mountain before I get eaten by a bear
Говно то успел вытряхнуть?😂😂😂
All jokes aside, it may have been a bluff, but it was fucking coming in HOT!!
Pee Wee Herman&#39;s bike would have had bear spray in the handlebars.
If I found myself in grizzly bear territory, I would always carry a high powered gun on me at all times, so if a grizzly bear charges at me, I can quickly kill myself before it reaches me
Ну и? Дальше то что? Надеюсь, все живы?
It was funny af when he seen the bear he aint care what was in his way😂😂😂
This is why you always carry bear spray on your person, either in a holster on your waist or on your chest, never inside a backpack.
I wonder how his balls survived , the bear was nothing
This just seems fake to me, the way the bears are moving is very unnatural. Almost photoshop like
Who the fuck goes into the National forest or any woods for that matter unarmed?! Let’s fucking get off our social media and start practicing common sense . Idc what the law says , don’t go unarmed without personal locator beacon , map, compass, extra water and food , flashlight with extra batteries , medical pouch , fixed blade knife, 550 cord, a rain coat and a emergency heat blanket and a cell phone or satellite phone . When with a gun carry at least 20-30 rounds . 3 rapid shots anyone who has in experience hunting in the area will know that’s a call for help and if you have firearm and you hear 3rapid shots for help should return 3 shots  to help that person to find their way. Also follow your gut instinct it’s like a 6th sense . Do you really want to know how many people go missing in the National forest and do you really think something is not gonna hunt you out there ?! You should probably look in 411 missing person cases before doing so. All above will save your ass .
What trail?
風鈴
自転車で山に入る時は鳴らし続けて走る　フエ　すず　自転車についてるベル
i didnt even see pooh bear 😓
When they know they will be in bear habitats,  why can&#39;t people just go to cycle parks  or just away from the bears
fake or real
This man used the &quot;OH SHIT!&quot; better than anyone who has ever Oh Shitted
What if it&#39;s a brown bear with cubs? I can see a mother not caring at all if you just play dead. She is going to put a hurt on you
There&#39;s always the keyboard warrior that&#39;s never been in bush before that knows it all
@17seconds is where he messed up. The wet brakes sounded like a wounded fawn.
Where did you think you were going? Through  the trees?
I bet the bikers pants went from neon yellow to a dark brown. I know mine would. 😆
Just fyi, you only see the bear for a fraction of a second.
7 years ago😆
Always carry a gun
😂😂😂😂
I’m sure the smell of poop in the bicyclist’s pants dissuaded the bear from continuing his charge.
Se fosse um penhasco o cagão teria se jogado. 🙄
This &quot;Ohhuuu shit&quot; earns the Oscar for the best &quot;last words of man who doesn&#39;t want to die but death was looking at him and he literally looks back&quot; 🤣🤣😂😭😂
Ouuuuh shit 😂😅😂😂 I agree
I survived many Grizzly Bear Attacks<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>in Red Dead Redemption II
Ever hear of bear spray?
That second guy is a trooper. I got let down and was attacked by a bear. The world needs more friends like the guy that stayed with his buddy
Dont forget to cycling in area that full of bears..do not cycling in safe area
your lucky to still be alive
Bear or cliff..... whisking bomb sound.....
You sure that bear wasnt just riding his bike and got scared and was hiding in the Bush like you?
naw that aint tha move
These look like black bears. I’ve heard wasp spray is better than anything to deter bears however,  I wouldn’t care what the laws were in Canada about shooting wildlife in National Parks if a gun kept ME alive.<br>Hope you had clean shorts, maybe that’s what kept her from attacking you when you stopped?
Yeah he’s gone guys get back to it
I don&#39;t ever wish anything bad to happen to any of us that enjoy our different nature hobbies. I kayak. Even if I&#39;m in a small lake. One compartment of my boat always has food, water, my side arm, 2 way radio, lighters, matches, tent, sleep bag. A 1 hour adventure anywhere can turn into a unseen disaster. Point being, all lucky to be alive stories, no one takes everything they need. If your mountain biking, purchase things in a large backpack to save your life..
Bet his heart stopped soon as he started losing his balance lol
I wouldn&#39;t cycling around there without a riffle on my back.
Bear was like: DOORDASH has arrived!!<br>🐻🍴
Scary
i just moved to the kootenays and had a black bear encounter. scariest moment of my life! that looked more like a black bear which are less aggressive which is why it left after you took off down the hill. to this day my biggest fear is coming across a bear. stay vigilant!
Man fined for littering, throwing bike away and dispensing human waste in  Jasper Alberta.
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😉
You know the squeaking of the bike sounds like a wounded animal
Federal parks in Canada during certain times of the year should ban bicycles. Too fast, too silent, you&#39;re on the bear before either of you know it, and the result is not going to be good for the rider.
Lucky lucky day for these guys! Glad they’re safe.
Imagine that bear has a bike too 😜😜
WTH did he say at :43???
Grizzly bear charged in Jasper, I would say...
Why in God&#39;s sweet heaven would an idiot ride a bike in  bear 🐻  country?
Que buen fotoshop
What about continuing the trail. Whats the point to break your arms and legs before the bear gets to you?
First of all where is the bear here? secondly, how stupid you have to be if there was a bear to still debate if you are suppose to go back or not! Of course! you have no chances with a grizzly on in such a bush, because its his territory and he perceives it as such.
Good thing bears cant run downhill
Those bear nacesitys
How about just carry a 50cal handgun and I promise it will keep you safe from bears.
Meals on wheels
It was Donald Trump in a costume!
Stand your ground, don&#39;t run.  This is what we actually do! That was terrifying
What I dont understand is why almost every single video where there is a bear encounter whether the bear gets sprayed/shot or not, there is always a large proportion of downvotes. There is absolutely no pleasing &quot;animal lovers&quot;. According to the &quot;animal lovers&quot; you are never to leave your house if there is an inkling of a chance at encountering a bear &amp; if you do have a bear attack you, you are rightfully supposed to just lay down &amp; die. You know, because bears are superior to humans &amp; their lives are far more important.<br><br>I doubt these people would feel the same way if it was their mother or brother who was getting mauled.
1-Bikes squeelin sounds like wounded game, key, don&#39;t brake;) 2- DON&#39;T RUN! YOU MAKE YOURSELF PREY BY RUNNING. 3-Your&#39;e lucky af that you didn&#39;t become lunch.
Lesson:  Always wear a diaper when traveling in bear country.
Imagine running away from one just to run into another........😱
Would the bear have stopped the charge if he stayed frozen?
Charge? Looks like it was just on hind legs to see what all the racket was. Usually when they smell a man they take off the other way FAST. Unless it is a mom and you are too close to cubs or you are just way to close and startle one. Neither seem to be the case here. Not sure if running away is wise. I think you are supposed to stay still, get your bear spray out and then slowly back away. Still. What an experience you had.  😧
It was Matt moneymaker
fake charge, they do it often
I never get tired of that &quot;ooh shiiiit&quot; holy jesus, that was pure despair right there
The best way to handle a bear attack is, eating beans and bad foods. Your fart will be much more effective than bear spray. I know, I wiped out many populations this way
Wait, what&#39;d the other guy do to get out of that?
I guess, to a bear, those fast moving and noisily chattering bikes seem like a serious threat to its cubs.
You made no noise whatsoever while on the trail. That’s pretty much why this happened. Great for your YouTube channel, not great for others.
Bro u was very lucky
When in a place with bears  bring a fucking BIG GUN might just save your life there
Bear smelled ur stink balls
Absolutely clueless dudes supposing he safe by carrying a pepper spray and funny part on video description: &quot;we&#39;re glad we didn&#39;t need to hurt the bear&quot; or something like that lol. Btw, it was likely a black bear... had encountered a grizzly and ran away I bet the end would be very different
Ffffuck.
動画主に同情して心臓止まりそうになった<br><br>怖くて最初から最後まで見れなかった<br><br>これ助かったってことでいいのかな？
That scene from reverent
Hope they took clean shorts along!
Bear thought you were prey moving so fast with the bike, charged out of reflex then backed off when it noticed you were people. Just like a whale or even shark swimming up to surfers.
Gracias
he damn near ran out of his shoes 🤣
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=228">3:48</a> you can see a couple of bears. Cubs perhaps
That makes sense wait for it to come back good one 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄😂
When humans encounter bears they turn into the crabs from finding Nemo.
WOW
Lmao i thought this was that dumb fake one
Is this in  jasper Texas?
Proud of them for standing their ground! BRAVE MEN!!!!
That thing was charging so fast it would have had him in 2 seconds after he turned his head away. Instead the guy has time to slowly find a small bush and some foliage for cover.
That bear use to belong to deebo
At least they had their helmets on
Keep fucking riding, hero.  It obviously doesn&#39;t want you around.  John Wick with that tiny ass pistol would&#39;ve gotten fucked up.
Maybe carry a 44 magnum when your in their house.
You can see a cub at about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=222">3:42</a> mark in the upper left corner going back up hill.
God forbid you put the camera down
You don&#39;t have to tell me bout this kind of thing , because this one time ....at band camp
Why the fuck would you go mountain biking where there&#39;s bears!!??😂 Mind you, we don&#39;t have bears in the UK so I expect that&#39;s easier for me to say!
That bear was like: “GET THE F***OUT MY FOREST!!!” 😆
Ok, so only 3 seconds of this 4 minute video was mildly interesting.
So, uh... That was quite a tumble.  You all good, bro?!
That bear knew where you were , and could have hurt or killed you at any time, and there is absolutely nothing on earth you could have done about it.
What was the second guy carrying that was blurred out of the video. Looked like a rifle
Вы очень везучие ребята:)) если рассматривать вас как ужин:))
I guarantee his butthole turned to ice the second he saw that bear running at him.
was you able to clean out your shorts seeing the dead bike?
I would have crapped my pants
wake up...when in backcountry..weather hiking/biking..carry a side arm.....357 or bigger...bears/mt.lions//ther everywhere/wake up.
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; Right there with you, buddy.
It was a hungry bear, and it was attracted to the meals on wheels.
Stop talking!!!!!!!!!!! Bears have great hearing and smell. Say nothing!
Its the same footage used in that other bear hoax video. Watch how the bears look &quot;jerky&quot; as they walk in the distance.  Super fake! Hahaha
Let’s all act shocked that a bear would chase after a bike in their home territory
Jasper Georgia? I live in Michigan and I still fuckin limit my forest time, I used to be all about survive and I loved the woods but now, idk, fuck all that survival shit if I don&#39;t have to I&#39;m not doing it.
It’s official... the cyclist has poo in his pants 💩
Careless!unless your wearing  a coat of armour?😂😂
The brakes sounded like an animal, I think the bear was there because of that sound.
This is why I take my 45-70 with me when I hike.
はいbad
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=183">3:03</a> same
Bro. I wouldn&#39;t just carried my bike in the opposite direction at that point
Darwin&#39;s theory of natural selection on display.
Meals on wheels!
Yet people say Australia&#39;s dangerous. Much rather deal with our stuff then that haha
Get a gun mate
I&#39;m happy there&#39;s no bears in my contry. <br><br><br>There&#39;s snakes and jaguars, tho.
This would NEVER happen to me...know why? Cause I lay on my couch eating Doritos watching videos like this on YouTube all day to remind me just how dangerous exercise can be. ESPECIALLY where there’s bears!
I wish the bear was hungry for how stupid you are biking in their territory
You can see the bear run up from the left at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=225">3:45</a> and the douche nozzle doesn&#39;t even see it
How do you keep animals from charging?<br>Take away their credit cards.
If the bear was committed to the charge you&#39;d  be dead
well hes asian soooo...........
My favorite thing about where I live in northeast Alabama is all we have are 200 lb black bears and they’re all chill as Hell.
He’s on bike going downhill and goes for the bushes as if the bear won’t get in there
Why did that baby jump off his bike and run like a scaredy-cat
2 for flinching!
bear no like white men on his land.
Go to 32 seconds into the video, then stop it right at 50 seconds because you do not need to see the rest of it nothing happens, You&#39;re Welcome.
Bears don’t like running down hills. Their front legs are shorter than their back legs so it makes them unstable
Fuck me. Get a hand cannon
So i guess bears really do not like bikes or people who ride them cause this is the second video ive see of someone getting charged at while on a bike .
People commenting that they won&#39;t go into the wild without being armed, why are you even going there? I&#39;m not stepping one foot where there are Grizzlies roaming 😂😂
As someone who’s encountered a bear in the wild before this video gives me PTSD
Did I miss something?!  The only thing I saw was the rider driving off the trail on purpose.  I saw no charge!!
Maybe next time use your bike to ride away
And that my friends is why I always carry my gun
People that zip silently through bear country will have run ins with bears ..duh ! Use your brain next time .
Glad I&#39;m from a land where the only threats of nature for the most part are aquatic
What fake video!
Fakeeeeeee my friend 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Looks like lost Blair witch footage
1111
Puta si sabis que hay osos en esos lugares lo minimo es andar con una pistola bien cargada.<br><br>Pd: Es como ir a nadar con pirañas 🤦‍♂️
Sir bears don&#39;t ask permission where you going or how ya doing buddy they assume you are trespassing on their PROPERTY which is call habitat go research this for your own health and safety and remember stay safe go ride biky in the city instead this is not your thing have a great day sir...
Bear spray?  You guys got lucky.  A mother with cubs will laugh at bear spray.
Don&#39;t mind me I&#39;m going to go home and change my underwear
You flip the bear off ... Then hit it with a Stone Cold Stunner
アオアシラ怖っ
At least you were not alone you just need to decide if you’re faster than your friend
Jimmy Halpert got bit by a radioactive bear right?? Well....
ran like a bitch square up next time
You forgot your bike
Would have been faster to dart back on the trail...not into the bushes.
Fake vid.
I was hiking in the mountains once and encountered a local. He told us that if a bear charges at you, you should run downhill because bears can&#39;t run downhill. So I suppose this dude did the right thing.
What does he say after oh shit?
I’m sorry but that’s a man in a bear suit, seriously
Was he trying suicide istead of being eat? 😂 I get that in these two seconds you have to make a decision that could safe your life, but why his brain didn t suggested him to keep going on the trail? Jajaha
He just wanted to ride your cycle!
Bears are killers... What the f*ck you doin out there anyway??? Should&#39;ve ate yo f*cking ass...
Dang! Almost 2 less A-Hole bikers... I was routing for the bear!
i think i knew it how to feel that. look so scary damn!<br>and 2013 aug 5 was when i join military service in korea xD
Crazy! I mountain bikes for 4 hours in Jasper and luckily didn&#39;t run into anything
:33 Fight or Flight. He didnt even think, it was just an instant human reaction.
BBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Going back up too soon
I got chased by a dog once
Same thing happens to me all the time............ except it&#39;s fat women...🤔
That was the most warranted &quot;oh sh!t&quot; I have ever heard!
Your brakes squealing have deer in distress <a href="http://sound.you/">sound.you</a> are lucky to be alive .
Was the trail that rough that the forest was a better option?
Biker 1: Wow!<br>Biker 2: You okay? <br>Biker 1: Yea, just a little scared.<br>Biker 2: That bear smells like crap, doesn’t he?<br>Biker 1: That’s me, dude.
You have to look for a tree to climb
Best comment section EVER!
Your handbrakes sounded like a dying animal. What do you expect?
2 bears at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=160">2:40</a> mother and cub
So how was immediately going off the trail a good idea, again???
Gun laws are so lax now...carry a gun. Everybody else does
Don&#39;t be stupid don&#39;t run away from the bear
Extremely lucky.
Damn wtfk 👀
Yet another reason to netflix and chill at home!
Guys, a bear can SMELL for up to two miles. I used to pack horses in CA Sierras. Horseback? YES. 35MPH. BIKE? HELL NO. God was protecting you, ABSOLUTELY. You&#39;re beyond blessed to be alive.
The reaction!!! Oh shit!!!!
Man this guy panicked and veered off the bike track, tumbled down a steep hill fell off his bike and risked being a easy lunch for the bear, I know u can&#39;t outrun a bear but I think I would&#39;ve taken my chance on the bike
Get some bear mace.
Bear: Why are you running?
Steel nerves. Scary
Looked more like a black bear
where did you buy your replacement seat and shorts?
If bear spray misses start trowing him shit... Where do you find the shit?.....
Omg how cracy...
Now if never seen a bear in the wild but I&#39;m pretty sure that was a lilttle of an over reaction pusssssssssssssssy
“OH SH*T!” - Famous last words of anyone experiencing a near death encounter.
He probably did what I&#39;d do in such situations, which is wet my pants after seeing my own life flash wright in front of my eyes.
Very Danger.
wow. this guy is damn lucky the bear didnt continue to follow him down the hill. he would have been a sitting duck.
1 reason why I carry a crossbow when I bike or hike
This is my neighbor. I rubbed honey on his seat before he left.
This is basically Skyrim with bikes
12 gauge with 3 inch magnums 00 buck shot will blow that bears head off!!!
Guys are thinking: how far to the car.<br>Bear is thinking: how long until dark.
Oh bear! Not, oh shit!<br><br><br>Shit it was you left in your pants 👍
You should of hit it with pepper spray, and kept recording, I want to see the ramifications of pissing off a grizzly with pepper spray.
That&#39;s what you get MB in Grizzly country.
bravo nek tije sa srecom
First thoughts are-😱 later thoughts are-😨Did I bring any clean undergarments?!
Ride in bear country with loaded 12 gauge,  blast bear in the face if bear gives you no option
I would love to see the bear come down to the bike, pick it up, get on it and ride away.
I’m so relieved it didn’t chase you further than that path🥺
“Wanna go back” yea nigga we outta here lol lucky he didn’t get his friend
Scary as fuck got lucky he didn’t chase after him probably wasn’t hungry 😋 lol
Carry bear spray and a rifle.
He might need  to be watching for whoever&#39;s weed he tumbled over.
I would have been inside a running vehicle that can get up and go .. And I mean fast , with the windows rolled all the way up and the doors closed .
Most compelling video on YouTube and it shows up in my recommended 7 years after publication.<br>However, #1, I wouldn&#39;t need bear spray, my screams would&#39;ve rendered the bear both deaf and blind. <br>#2, I&#39;m gonna need a new pair of cycle pants forth with.
If your reading this dont ever fuck with bears
Who on earth thumbed this down?
That&#39;ll learn ya!
What’s the guy in front at the end holding?
That sure was a scared grizzly bear charge. I would have been scared too ????!!!!?!!??
Wasn&#39;t  your  time  friends  those small bears can cause damage too.  And they can out run you.
The fact that you turned downhill apparently  may have saved your life. Even braver was that you went back up the hill for round two!<br>On a lighter note. Is that the noise of mud under your shoes or a shit pancake jostling between your cheeks?
Running and cycling on bear country. Not a good idea
This is when you realize that you are actually not on top of the food chain
Your breaks sound like a young deer call.
That is what you get for biking
I think your only lucky this time that they didn&#39;t feel like charging.<br>The distance the closest one got would have been on top of you after a short sprint. Why you were hanging around is beyond me.
Looks at cliff..looks at grizzly..looks back at cliff..    yaYEET
Figured as much, Mama had babies out there.. People really should be more aware if they&#39;re gonna be out on bear turf  🐻🐻
Bear country is not a big enough country to be in.
only liberals would go into the woods where there are grizzlies without a gun.
100 bucks says they walked their bikes back😂😂
Man the albertans get mould buy bears every year us in sask we carry guns on the daily
Bro your in grizzly territory an don’t have bells on your bike to alert the bear ?? Or bear spray your wild lol
That pistol I was gonna bring is just too bulky he said, once. There are going to be those who take up for the bear and be mad that you didn&#39;t offer yourself as a treat for the bear. There always are, lol.
0.36 When your girlfriend says, she’s home alone.
Lol would have been much better if he just continued on the trail rather than taking a tumble
Did you bring toilet paper? Next time remember the toilet paper
Complete waste of time
I&#39;d like to criticise the sound quality and the fact that you didn&#39;t mic the bear up beforehand. Just saying 🐻😁
Biker&#39;s move too fast by the time the bear hears you, you&#39;re on it....
Looks just like here in finland. Did you know it&#39;s better to bike on trail than in the forest 😅
Always carry a 10mm glock with a spare mag in the woods
Carry a 357 snub nose. At least someone will hear the shots and find your body.
Jfc. You did everything wrong in this situation. You need to make a lot of noise in bear country, and never, EVER run from a bear. You&#39;re one lucky man.
Fake
I&#39;d jersey that bear and dust him with mah right hook...
Go to canada they said
&quot;ohh shit!&quot; 😂
😭😭😭
How does he live himself knowing<br>that he ran away like coward instead of squaring up and fighting like a man?  SAD!!!
480 p thats impressive for these types of videos.
Just say no to the bear, it will respect your personal space and be ashamed about itself.
Just hit them in the head with a frying pan they like that.
CGI is cool!
Probably was a &quot;bluff&quot; charge telling you to get the f^&amp;k out of my way. I&#39;ve seen and experienced this with black bears on the AT in Virginia.
Scarier than the horror movies they make these days.
thats what my neighbour does when i open the fridge door too loud at 3am
This is scary not that other fake ass video of the guy getting chased on a bike
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=31">0:31</a> <br>Did your front brakes squeal “BEEEEEEAAAARRR?!?”<br>Was it just me who heard that shit?!?
Why would people go there if they can encounter bears there
Momma Bear to Cubs.<br><br>&quot;Hold my bear&quot;<br><br>Ba-dum bum
Next time don’t run. Make yourself look big and stand ur ground.
If your in bear country you need a .44 not a can of hot sauce. You Midas we&#39;ll bring some pepper and salt for the ole grizzly.
I will never understand white people. If you know there are bears in those woods, why on earth would you ride a bike in them?  They have mechanical gym bikes now. You dont have to risk death every time you go outside.
Can someone tell where is this forest??
Wow he stumbled quite quickly after seeing the bear running, where did the bear go? Maybe he does this for fun, scaring humans 😂
That grizzly was lucky to get away alive.
Well if your bike brakes didn&#39;t squeek  just like a baby deer , you would of been fine.
Maybe a gym is better
What the hell are you doing in the wilderness without a gun? Duh...a ..44 mag revolver with a bear round would be a good idea. You are in Wyoming.
Probably if you had  personal protection say a 357 Magnum, oh wait a minute the government won&#39;t you do that .
Bear repellent will do NOTHING but piss it off.  Best to always have a 44mag w/300grn bullets or larger on you at all times.  Their population is increasing and moving closer to humans.  I’m just saying if you’re going to be outdoors where they range. Better to be safe. They are man eaters!
Fake news
Careful
You know what really scary? Drop bears. You don&#39;t have the luxury of seeing them charge. They just drop straight down on you. So unless you can wear a fire on your head cause they really hate fire? Then you have to be always looking up. Which makes off road biking pretty hard.
My birthday is August 4th :)
The bear was just jogging and you stopped in his way
The bear just wanted to play tag
The bear just wanted to play tag
why do people go alone in the woods where there are bears? Wouldn&#39;t the smart thing to do be take someone with you?
Hate to tell ya bear spray will not do anything when you get between a mom and her Cubs.  When you come up fast like that her instinct is to kill you.
Perfect exam6of what not to do.
Never get between a pissed off mom and her little kids, make that a new rule for you and your boyfriend! 😂
Phew! I&#39;m really smelling poopy bike shorts, yuck! 😂
Y&#39;all know this is fake right?
You don&#39;t have to out run the bear ,just your friend
That squeaking sound your brakes are making probably didn’t help lol. <br>Either way when your biking through the trails and a predator sees you on a bike moving like that it sets them off.
If there is a grizzly bear in there and you fall off your bike tryna out run it you get up and run to the closest hiding spot you can find
His brakes sounded like a wounded prey animal to the bear.
Beutiful place but I wouldn&#39;t go bike riding there
BEAR DISPATCH: they&#39;re rite on top of you! <br><br>BEAR: i gottem....
Omg he’s so cute 🐻🍯
&quot;Frankly I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t have to harm the mother in any way...&quot; <br><br>Dude, you had bear spray against a fucking   grizzly. Bear spray is a mild irritant against one of those monsters! I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re one of the few people worried about injuring a grizzly bear in a face to face encounter. I could have a benelli M4 loaded with slugs, a barrett M107 50 cal, and a 50 cal desert eagle and I&#39;d be totally concerned... about myself, not dying a horrific death at the hands of a massive fucking grizzly 10 meters away. <br><br>My point being. You could have done your worse with whatever you had available to you at that point, and the bear would have been just fine
Fake
When traveling in bear country always wear little bells that jingle which alerts the bear that you are in the area. Also, carry pepper spray to spray them if they get too close. For preventative measures, watch for signs of bears in the area, like tracks and bear poop. The tracks should be obvious when you see them but the bear poop can be harder to identify. You can tell when it is bear poop because it will have little bells in it and it will smell like pepper.
WOW SO COOL!!!<br>THANKS FOR SHARING!!!<br>GLAD I WASN&#39;T THERE!!!<br>LOL!!!!
As I’m watching this Taylor Swift song came on out of the woods She’s out of the woods but you guys look fucking stuck
Bears like: GOT EM! Huff huff huff
The bear probably thought you took a shit so he told his buddies you guys all smell that?... Fucking meats ruined ... c&#39;mon let&#39;s go
What the fuck was his friend doing? He walks up to him and he turns looks back and it&#39;s like he&#39;s pretending to hold a make believe sword in his hands
Smith and Wesson 500
Well there’s a million ways to die doing this hobby getting eaten by a bear or go to another country and do trails and get eaten by a wild cat or racing through a forest and end up impaled on a tree
You dumb fucks 9 times out of 10 momma will charge again until the threat is dead or gone always Back away immediately don’t stand and film together she will rip you both to shreds
Fuck bear spray get you 500 smith and Wesson..fucking bear spray pretty sure that bear will eat you with hot sauce that your spraying
Did anyone else see the second  guys fucking Teeth...Jesus those chompers should&#39;ve scared the Bears or worst case he goes full Dracula on their asses lmao
Lucky that bear didn&#39;t take that pepper spray and use it as hot sauce on your ass! Get a 40 cal like a man!
I have no sympathy for these people, your in bear country what did u think would happen, if u was to get mauled by the bear it would be the bears fault...<br>Same as people that get attacked by sharks...go in there territory and expect to get fucked up...brain dead people
The ground was shaking when that bear charged
Doe ! It’s amazing how fast you reacted phew !

I don’t know, but whenever my Dad took me up in the mountains on trails, we wore bells on our shoes, whistles around our necks and Dad was armed.  We saw bear from time to time and once, a lynx, but never had to shoot in self-defense or get charged.  I wouldn’t go unarmed into the back country.
It was running away from big sasq
worst editing ever
Dude turned around and looked like jarjar Binks
CGI bear .
Oooooo SHIT !!!!!!! xDxDxD
Well that’s not nice of you...that bear saw you taking a little rest and gave it his all to bring you a cold drink. And whatta you do? You run from him like he’s a toxic person.
So much for “bears never run downhill.”<br><br>Glad you are ok.
You need to bring bear spray along.
That Schwinn is going to sell like hot cakes.
people in this comment section have no chill 😂
for those who read comments before viewing, there’s half a quarter of a second of bear, and 4 minutes and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=271">4:31</a>.875 seconds of nature watching
I got chased by a sheep in kent, it charged me!! £10 fkin quid for a ball of wool!
Ya gotta be outta your head if you are hiking or biking where these bears roam!
You and your buddy went &quot;tharn&quot; in Animal Farm speak.  Get the hell out of the woods boys.  You&#39;ve NO IDEA how to survive in the woods where there are actual predators ready and willing to kill your dumb asses!!!!  I am very concerned for your welfare since you&#39;ve no idea how to survive in the wild!!!
Yes, lets just stand there like idiots with no weapons, waiting for the bear to come and kill our asses.  WHY are you not moving with great haste away from that bear infested area?????
Should have brought your spas shotgun with you hiking
It charged because of the sound of his breaks..like a wounded animal..
Fake
Have you boys sued Go-Pro yet for ripping off your actual experience?
What was that sqeaking noise?
Change your shorts
This ass clown should have climbed the tree. Grizzly bears cannot climb trees like black bears can. Instead of going down the hill risking breaking his leg and getting mauled by the bear lol
Where do yoi wanna go ride bicycle?<br><br>**:at the near neighborhood.if it&#39;s ok with you.<br><br>Friend:fine with me...👍👍
I live 15 minutes away from Jasper and there are a ton of bears here. The last time I drove home, from Jasper, I saw 5 bears. <br>The last time I went camping, in a big campground, they had Forest Rangers going around telling people what to do if they ran into a bear because a bear was hanging around the campground. They are constantly in people&#39;s backyards and the towns have even had to place warning signs, within school zones, because bears have been seen wandering around the area.
I’m a YouTube expert. And that was definitely a golden retriever,NOT a grizzly bear.
This aut to tell u, never go into the wilderness WITHOUT a gun, or u could b somthings lunch.
Oops must peddle faster
Ну все ушел, вытряхивай кирпичи.
Что эти два дурака там стоят гипнотизируют медведя что ли? Там валить надо что бы педали сверкали,я бы на их месте по этому виду спорта на велосипеде по горам рекорд поставил бы,елки только сверкали бы, ну его на хрен это  лес и катание на велосипеде где есть гризли,лучше лев, тигр, любой хищник только не медведь, это животное рвет своими когтями 20см тебя в живую это ужас.
Why the hell did he go barreling off the mtn instead of staying on the trail!?

Grizzlies aren&#39;t black. I did not see any charge or attack. I get it. Every Bear is a Grizzly and every Shark is a Great White. I just love sensationalism.
Bring a picnic basket as a gift and the Bears won`t bother you. Mr. Ranger may get mad though. He hates bears with picnic baskets.
I just don’t understand that why people go to trails alone when they know about wild animal surroundings 🤦🏽‍♂️😵
Dan has so much guts to stand his ground with  that bear charging at you ,total legend.
Let me see if I got this right. You went bike riding in bear country and for protection you have on you pretty helmet. You should have had a .50 desert eagle, stopped the bike, let his ass get close, fire two in the dody and one in the head. Take pictures and enjoy life.
Smart people would of stayed on the trail. Idiots go offroad and wonders how the bear caught them.
Lol “what kind of bear are those” if you have trouble identifying bears don’t bike ride in Grizzly country
Does a bear shit in the woods?yep and this mountain bicker shit his pants 😆
Literally no one: <br><br>My 10 yo brother: <br><b>”Dude it’s not that hard bro- just jump on the bears back like a sav and ride that thing to it’s death bed🤷‍♀️ or just yeet it with a pic ax:/“</b><br><br><br><br>What he would actually do if approached by a bear:<br><br>🏃‍♂️💨💨💨💨
Did you draw anti-grizzly bear circle around yourself
First rule of mt. biking:  have bear spray.   . . . LOTS of bear spray!
He was waiting for his friend to be mauled <a href="http://alive.lmfao.you/">alive.lmfao.you</a> good johnny!
What kind of weapon was the guy holding?

Bears make great garbage pickup , just leave a bag full of garbage outside your tent , and the bear will come like the garbage man , and pick it up.I had this happen to me.A bear pick up my garbage outside my tent.Fortunately i lived to learn a great lesson , do not sleep next to your garbage <a href="http://bag.you/">bag.You</a> might become a barritio snack in a sleeping bag.Thank you , Jesus for saving me.
That bear was at least 10 yards away from him. He&#39;s lucky to be alive. Crazy.
Fake
Squeaky brakes sounded like prey in distress call I’d get those fixed lol
I think Americans have no respect for Bears.  I guarantee you no one would go mountain biking in the African wilderness.
At least you were wearing a helmet.
Mama bear , hey kids , lets get a laugh , watch me scare the sh## out of this dude on the bike . Bears walk away to there favorite tree and laugh there asses off .
The fact that this video has been uploaded proved that you two good bastards  survived the ordeal. That&#39;s what counts.
i beg your pardon. but have you seen boo boo.
The bears can have it shit...I’m riding in the city
If just one person had a concealed carry it would have changed everything 🇺🇸💯
Bear spray ? You didn’t even used it , i guess what scare him away was your shit spray
Rider: “I want to ride my bicycle, I want to ride my bike.  I want to ride my bicycle, I want to ride it wear I go!”<br><br>Bear be like: Bi-cycle!  Bi-cycle!  Bi-cycle!
What&#39;s for lunch....bear steak I carry a .45-70 for just such occasions..<br>Boom baby.

If you ever see me fighting in the forest with a grizzly bear Help The Bear!!!
how about we call it a day Dan?
Oh Shit is right
Too bad people are too fucking stupid to realize that this is fake
Didn’t know I had so much in common with bears.
I dont get people who do shit like this and don&#39;t carry a gun
Bears come to my home every night we keep loads of bear spray. Haven’t had to use it yet! Thank god
hearing the gallop of the bear in the beginning is horrifying
Captioning would be nice...couldnt grasp the conversation
3,48
Fake
She has a young one...
Rumour has it the man&#39;s still there. Waiting for a safe time to get going again.
The noise the breaks made when he stopped his bike sounded like an injured animal and might have got the bears interest is what I think happened here.
Same thing happened to me last week, it wasn&#39;t a bear though it was a foaming squirrel.
I won&#39;t lie, I would definitely shit my pants
Biker stops and looks right<br>Bear sitting: hello there
Hey man far out,lets go riding in Bear Country, with no gun.
Rule number one when you see a bear.... don&#39;t stop to pull out your phone to film it. get the F#<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23k">#k</a> out of there. You stick around you are going to be bear poop. Stupid is is stupid does.
I think if your boy didnt show up you were dead.  Maybe scared him once he saw another guy.
20 0z bottle of Bear Repellant would keep you alive and no need to change your shorts, I would of needed to. Take care Guys
bro don&#39;t dy
exit, stage left even
The bear just wanted a scooby snack.
Where&#39;s the Bear?
lame
lame.
All you bikers insisting  on trails for bikes, may you meet a bear and die. This is not our habitat. It is theirs. Please remember that and not you extreme sport....
He just wanted your autograph he was a fan , now he&#39;s going to talk sht about you on Y.T for brushing him off .
When you see a grizzly bear with cubs, you know that you’re royally fucked
You can literally hear his heart pounding
Your brakes sound like a fawn in distress that’s my guess you most likely lured him in for lunch.
this was your chance to do a gnarly bunny hop to quick stall on top of a bear and you decided to run straight into a tree instead. You turned left and I gawked for a bit before realizing you were preparing for a killer run downhill w/ a few good jumps, but I guess I&#39;m happy to see you are still alive and safe.
Should have gotten off and drawn a circle.
I dont understand the point in riding a bike unarmed in an area where there are jus bear roaming around
That bear may have heard the sound of your brakes squeaking. That kind of sounded like a baby cub call.  The sight of a baby cub is pretty much game over for you without defense.
These stupid people
Go for a hike, carry a gun...
I don&#39;t go hiking without my 9 mill
Pretty dumb, hard to feel sorry for dumb people.
I thought you&#39;re going to die just riding down hill into the forest.  Around here, you&#39;d die from falling off a cliff.  You were lucky on both sides of the coin that day.  Next time, stop... hold your bike above your head and back up SLOWLY.... cubs involved though... so ya... the cliff would of been less painful.
wow i thought you wer dead ?
Fight or flight syndrome....and why are you both just hanging around eith your GoPro’s. You would’ve lost  this one pal.  Hope you learned something from this.
City folk.
Never run from a charge. Never. Get off the bike. Put the bike between you and the bear and stand your ground. You’re sooo lucky to be alive.
People are fucking dumb your gonna risk getting mauled to death or eaten alive just to ride a stupid fucking bike y&#39;all aren&#39;t adrenaline junkies or sportsmen your fucking IDIOTS
Why ya riding a bike in the woods first of allll you stupid fuck
Just a mama bear protecting her cubs.  Glad you guys were ok
oánh chết cha giờ
The bear just wanted to ask you for directions
It probably was chasing the sound of your brakes that sound like something dying
I&#39;d have died of a heart attack right there! Did ya see the face on the bear? Pretty sure you scared the shit out of him too lol!
Got dam
Slowed down to .25 around second 25 and you can see the bear before the biker stops
Hay veces q las personas se buscan las cosas Por q no vas a montar bicicleta en un lugar donde no aya oso de veras te pasas de pendejooooo......

More idiots hanging out where Bears live! &quot;You almost had a [Back Country] moment son!&quot; <br>Back Country, watch the true story on Netflix! You&#39;ll never enter the forest again!
It was Ben the bear. Ol grizzly Adams was up in the trees watching y&#39;all !
Where&#39;s the charge? You were riding, saw a bear and panicked and rode down a hillside leaving your friend at the top. No charge. Just over reacting. Don&#39;t go into bear country unless you&#39;re prepared to handle bear interactions.
Now thats what i call a bear trap!
Dont afraid. I wont bite
It will be fine take a couple of bath salts and stand your ground
What caliber pistol were you carrying bro. Hope it was @ least 45 acp to 10mm
I wouldn&#39;t enter the woods without at minimum a 10mm.
Comments:<br>90% chastising people who say film better<br>10% people actually saying film better
Your breaks sound like distressed rodent a bit lol<br>You sounded like food
Just stay away from their territory.
This video sucks so bad it is unreal
nice and very very fake!!!
Might have been the brakes with the squeal to a bear might sound like a hurt animal just guessing but yeah defo squeaky bum situation.
Is jasper In Wyoming?
Anyone else heard his heart pounding? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23heartbeat">#heartbeat</a>
The  most rridicilous thing is that people bike, hike and live in areas where this kind of animals live as well - and in the era of knowledge available with a few clicks have absolutely no knowledge what to do when they face one. Human race is stupid.

I believe there were Cubs. You can see more than 1 at top of hill  closer to end of vid. You guys were lucky to not have been attacked.  Gave you plenty of  warning too.
Just wondering...what made you instantly get off the beaten path and then off your bike? I&#39;m not judging  because I have no clue what I would do if actually faced with this situation. But....I would think staying on your bike and hauling ass with be the better escape route.
Im assuming everyone is aware that google will soon let you see moving bears/animals within a half mile of where you are ,ending random bear encounters.The real Mike Wilson subscribe 2 me
It&#39;s going into the woods ANYWHERE 101, YOU SEE A MOMMA BEAR YOU FUCKING RUN!

Your breaks were acting as a predator call I think😅
Yeah jump off your wheels and hide 😂 great tactical plan my friend

You “Bearly” survived bro! Lol
That bear was a  paid actor.
It played out exactly how I thought it would biker sees bear and turns off the trail heads straight down hill towards the unknown tree trunks and thickets. Instead of staying on the trail and out of the bears direction of travel. If that bear was hungry enough all he had to do was slow down and come unwrap your ass out of the cluster fuck you were tangled up in 🤣
He just wanted someone to play with... lol
Need more bear.
At least you burnt more calories than expected that day eh?! You made ‘er out alive!
Our country luckily no bear
Black bear. Lucky it wasn&#39;t a grizzly. She had cubs
Dude I have nightmares about this shit
The bear was just answering the mating call of your brakes you big tease!
Why did they turn and crash when a perfectly good trail was heading downhill. Seems to me a better way to get away than heading into the weeds and crashing within the first few feet. Oh well, it’s their life. They can spend it anyway they want.
Have all cyclists got a death wish  in city&#39;s they go straight through red lights undertaking buses and great big trucks on tight left hand turns an when you give a toot on the horn u get abuse an a ridged digit thrust in the air ,,, an there just as stupid in a forest with massive tear your face off bear&#39;s and the people are on push bikes ffs atleast have a moto x bike
Nadie habla español 😢
Bears are no joke. Not like a Disney movie.
Ya no se puede caminar por los senderos del bosque sin encontrarte al coñazo antiecologico de estos tipos de la bicicletita, que te pueden atropellar en el sitio más inesperado.
You supposed to talk to them not run 🏃‍♀️.  Boring video
Good thing she just wanted to scare you away.  Glad you’re okay.
I can picture that bear leaning against a tree laughing at the idiot who decided riding his bike down the hill through the woods was a good idea to escape.  Lmao
It&#39;s okay for a grown man to piss himself in some situations.
Your playing in the bears backyard, I know it&#39;s a scary situation but bring some weapons along with bear spray...Rambo knife, flare gun, *air horn, back up knife 😉
Todays the day the teddy bears have their picnic...<br><br>And your the dessert...
You might as well be a steak riding by on a bike.

RELAX IT&#39;S JUST ME
‘Grabbed the bear spray from his bag’ you’re both lucky to be alive. Bear spray should be more accessible than your phone or gopro, it should be instantly accessible. Also spraying the bear would not harm it, spraying a short warning shot even out of range nearly always deters the bear from further aggressive behavior because they can smell it, surprising innit? Props for even having it, most cycleheads seem to think they’re immune to animals while sitting on their nuts. The two dumbasses in Washington found out recently that mountain lions aren’t afraid of bicycles either.
All three of you are unhurt. That&#39;s something
And that is why I carry my glock 17 with me when I ride, granted I&#39;m on a fourwheeler (much faster than a bike obviously lol) but when shit hits the fan I got a 10 round mag with Mr bears name on it.
In case of bear charge turn left and drive off cliff.....
Lmao, he went straight down the hill into the tree&#39;s. 😂
what made the guy turn towards the bear? did he hear him rushing towards him or growling?
I would not be standing there after that. I would have ripped myself up with how quick I would be going up one of those trees lol a surprise grizzly charge would have me and anyone else shitting their pants 😂
I didn’t see a bear charge.  What gives?
Y ride your bike there ? I mean how extreme do you  need to be lol
Nah stay home!!
<b>&quot;OH SHIIIITTT&quot;</b><br><b>ROLLS OFF TRAIL</b>

Why don’t the bear spray cans have an air horn, which would surely scare the bears off at distance. Then spray for close encounters?

You people make me laugh. Your in the wild, just light a fire ffs or climb a tree and when he follows you up kick his grip and he&#39;ll fall, then jump on his belly and bounce back on to your bike..Its happened to me loads
This is the third video of people saying oh shit when seeing a bear I seen today😂😂 i probably would say oh fuck
If you want an adrenaline rush.... this is what you should do! 😇🤕🤣😜
BRUM BRUM EDGAR!!!
once ya see the cubs,ya better run when the parents catch up like if u agree
Dont me so with mama bear. Lol

I&#39;ve never seen a can of bear spray in that  new,  economy free sample  size .  (the directions say, good for one mature, Koala bear)
Holy shit man, bet that left a streak in the undies.
Are very lucky these are not grown bear charging you with real intent, cause while I understand it&#39;s easy for others to say who where not there but I have experienced it with dangerous animals on the large side although not as big as a full grown Grizzly (which these are not either), this is NOT the way to do it if genuinely attacked, playing dead is also as stupid as it will ever get but never turn your back and flee in panic, never! Many animals also have a superb smell and hormones can be detected + just mood in general triggering them further.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t15t8WyFY9k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t15t8WyFY9k</a>  There you go, prime example of what to do and must mean it and come out in a genuine way, whether a cougar, bear or even wild boar on the big side (can be as dangerous as small bears) which is the last one I experienced unexpectedly coming up on some small ones and next I ay something charging from the corner of my eye that I missed focusing on the wrong thing out of curiosity cause not often you do see them out here even when hearing them ever so often.  I get it&#39;s some snowflakes not liking this but do not care, men are not what they used to be, if it&#39;s potentially your last seconds why not at least fight for them, if reacting fast and properly you could just walk away without a scratch like that brave Swedish man did and that was not a playful cub either.
These fake bear vids are getting out of hand
luck counts.
Just like the Horror movies...fall down while running away lol.
Huh? And his friend behind him didn&#39;t get attacked?
People think this is real or what!
You use pepper spray , lay down on the ground use your bag as a shield while using your arms to cover your head or fight for your life because unless the grizzly lost sight of or had no interest its going to charge non stop.
lucky he a got bear spray
You could have been at home watching netflix but no.  Stupid is as stupid does so they say....
Even bears hate bike riders....
Another reason to carry a 44 caliber!!
Meals on Wheels that&#39;s what the bear was thinking
I remember this video....this was INSANE! That bear was charging with only one intention 👀
CHARGE*
BROING where was the change of the grizzly bare
Mount a airhorn on your handle bars.  It&#39;s loud as fuck and will scare it off
There&#39;s always that one &quot;expert&quot; that comments &quot;Oh, I would&#39;ve done a backflip and then zoomed pass the bear matrix style. And then stab it in the heart with my butter knife&quot;
We should just kill all the bears in America so we can have some fun
It was absolutely those damn breaks that caused this charge. The bear was honing in on the sound which sounded a lot like a calf of some sort. I think the bear was just as shocked to run up on you as you were. If it wanted you it easily could have had you, it stopped almost immediately upon seeing you.
You bearly made it out alive
Its dont Real
You must have shat your pants when you saw her charging
Except for the gays, this was a waste of time watching
We used to live in a shyte neighbourhood. Riding home at twilight was a lot like this, no bears just bear eating people with the red eyed rash!
Yogi just wanted your picanic basket.
This guy just BARELY came close to that bear if I where in that position it would have been UNBAREABLE to watch
Stupid bears, people die all the time just minding their business and bears come and mall them to death
Hey guys, time to start cycling 🚴‍♀️ in town 😮
Bullshit video not worth posting. Wanted to see or hear him being eaten alive. Take this pussy ass vid down
It didn’t keep charging after you because he/she was standing their ground and was trying to push you out of it. Probably thought you were a threat with the sound the bike or you and your buddy were making.
the bears are just letting these city slickers know they&#39;re too close and should back off
Where exactly is this place
Why ride on trails where you can be killed by a bear.Mentally challenged.
Brakes sound like a dying animal
Wow! That was intense!
Did you have a gun?
Talk about danger close woo babay
Wow! Lots of Grizzlies roaming around Jasper.  There is a famous #200 something Grizzly that some asshole trophy hunter killed.
Luckily for you that was a warning charge and it was probably a mother warning you to back off from her cubs near by🤦🏾‍♂️also, never run from a bear. Running literally triggers it’s predatory instincts to chase you
Fucking morons. Bear mace doesnt do shit. Get a fucking gun you fucking idiots.
That&#39;s what happens when you play on someone else&#39;s playground! Score one for the bear! 0 for the helmet head! Ha ha!
I&#39;m glad you bear through this traumatic situation.
Awwwww. Shiiiitttttttttt. Lmaoooo
Why can&#39;t the disgusting human race leave the wild life alone?
Anyone else jump at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=71">1:11</a> thinking that rock in the upper left-hand corner was the bear again?
Ya...no 👀
Lol,  the spray is cute.   Careful where you tread, and if you do,  bringing a bigger stick.
Everyone saying the grizzly had no chance. . . 😂 hand to hand combat NO GUNS that grizzly would tear that guy like some homework. this guy is VERY lucky to have encountered such a beast and it just wanted to be his friend he came across Pooh bear
Not sure what I would have done. But turn and go as fast as possible the other way may have been my first instinct as well. Glad you survived man damn!<br><br>That would have to be top five most intimidating animals you could happen upon mountain biking wow!
I live in blue ridge
Be nice to be allowed to have a high caliber pistol.
Aww she was scared , just crouch and speak softly to her while reaching out with your inner man bear convincing her you only wanna snuggle and be her friend ....it works ...just ask ole Timmy .
I bet that Shit scared all the Shit out that bikers ass
Imagine if it were a tiger..
Hey, who wants to go mountain biking through Grizzly 🐻 country?! Let&#39;s gooooooooooo!!!!!!?????
I don&#39;t like bicyclists either.
Gee a bear charged at you because you were riding a bike in the woods for no reason that&#39;s crazy
Stupid why ride your bike were you can be killed.  Stupid people.
Another fake shit on YouTube
No gun in the woods ?
Holy crap man! Glad nothing bad happened to either of you. It doesn&#39;t always end up like The Great Outdoors. Stay safe!
At that point, you&#39;re just screwed.
And why wouldn’t you have your own bear spray? If that bear wanted you, you would have been screwed buddy...
Fucking stupid bastard. Going into the woods unarmed. Bad choice
I think your brakes sounded like a wounded animal.  That’s what drew the bear’s attention.
I had a similar situation when I was hitchhiking Cross Canada near Fernie BC, but it was a cougar checking me out from the woods.  I had an extra pair of shoes with me and threw them as far as I could into the ditch and along with some clothes. Now I can honestly say from experience I bet you those bicyclers s*** their pants
Funny how u where standing BEHIND ur friend afterwards.. &quot;slowly step back while pushing ur buddy forward&quot; is how u prevent urself from getting attacked haha<br><br><b>Glad you guys where ok</b>
If that guy was smart he would slit his friends bike tire and take off.
This guy definitely  pee&#39;d his pants just a little bit...
That would be hilarious if he had a pump spray. f**k that pepper spray. I&#39;d be carrying my 357.
It was a bear. It really had to go. The bikers made her lose that urge. I&#39;d be mad too.
Hey let&#39;s take a bike ride in the woods where at any time a grizzly bear could kill us. I know, let&#39;s not bring any weapons or bear spray to help us get away. All we need are cameras to film us being eaten, will be famous on YouTube.
wheres the geizzly bear charge??? jw.  learn how to label your videos.
Where&#39;s Betsy DeVos when you need her?
What a pussy! I would of squared off wit dat nigga!
Holy crap at least you were wearing your bike helmet!!
Jesús christ I woulda shit myself if I ever saw that , thank god I live on an island
This is fake
Bears are bad mmmk
Holy fuck
paras, from the philippines 🇵🇭?
There&#39;s no way I would go out anywhere where there is bears without being armed.
Wow that thing was coming at its top speed WHILE down hill so even faster...you see him hear the whistle and look downhill left n feel him think oh shit it’s not there so it must be up hill right?! Turns cam<br>Edit: I read desc. And oh..still amazing luck you heard
Get on yer bike and ride
should be called seen bear soiled my panties
it was a Circus bear and was attracted to the bike.
&quot;This is fake&quot;...
It was a bluff charge. If it wanted your ass it would have been through that underbrush like nothing. These things are faster in uneven ground than you could ever believe
Bears get bored. That&#39;s how they have fun. &quot;Hey Carl here comes some bikers, watch this shit&quot; They were probably rolling around laughing their asses off and drinking some PBR&#39;s they lifted from someone&#39;s cooler.
Man I wish my music was in the movies Clayton astoforoff on Facebook and YouTube
Holy shit
Dont post crap like this. BEAR CHARGE my eye. Had you titled it &#39;I saw a bear&#39; I wouldn&#39;t be so disappointed.😐
If you are going to bike thru grizzly territory, you should carry a gun. I don&#39;t understand these leftist anti gun fuck tards who want to ban all guns.
You stopped...he was gunna come give you some directions....
Continuing to screw with a mother bear with her cub nearby, is just plain stupid.  If prople are going to go into bear country (all types of bears not just grizzlies) they had better know about and have a healthy respect for, what bears do.
I&#39;d be caring bear spray or a shorty shot gun on my backpack if I were you guys
Why do humans have to invade every inch of the planet and can not leave other species in peace.
I agree that these animals should live. What I do not agree with is if a 1,000 lb animal is charging you that can run twice as fast as you should &quot;stop, drop and roll.&quot; You want be a rag doll for 5-10 minutes before death by pain go ahead. Armageddon. Don&#39;t ride your * tricycle in bear country unless your traveling for a PURPOSE, which does not include &quot;spending the weekend with the GUYS(who does that?)or a f <b>picnic</b> this is &quot;territory&quot; not fkn Central Park. Take your childish Fking bike riding to parkour in the city where you can get just as bone broken by cement slabs the same way you can by trails &quot;littered&quot; by large sized rocks, bull moose and protective female grizzlies. I don&#39;t like to call people idiots but riding &quot;bicycles&quot; on rock strewn dirt trails in grizzly country for kicks constitutes some sort type of brain loss. Somehow surfing is cooler because you can&#39;t carry a firearm in the water to defend yourself so at least you KNOW you are <b>F</b> UP!
What’s in bear spray that’s so bad that puts them off? Like celery and black olives etc yeh?
Atlast not a fake bear chase video..
Most boring video ever <br>Don’t understand how it’s garnered 6.3 million views
You should have stay on your bike and continue riding it and you will have gone far and faster away from the bear . Stay on tracks and the bear will not able to keep up with you .is what I think the safest way
i want my gd 4 minutes back.  *hitsbackbutton *selectsNOTINTERESTED
Lame
I didn’t see bear
Bear thought you had a newborn bear on your wheels.
Lol mmm chicken
&quot;Charge&quot;? Pssh
Who else thought that rock was the bear
Pussies! If the grizzly wanted you you assholes would have been chopped up and spit out his ass within a nanosecond. You still there for f*<b>***</b> ever and nothing happened. F***! You children stay out of the woods!
So regardless of the yellow streak...it is a well known fact a person can’t outrun a bear and you drop your bike as your fleeing did it occur to you to turn around and ride like fuck... key to all things that create fear watch and analyse before you act of course easier said then done
i&#39;m scary
You should have had a nice glock 20 on your hip. He would seen it and turned around
Not sure why you stuck around. Seems like you put yourselves and this bear family in danger. The charge was a shot off the bow. It&#39;s a warning.
This is my ex-husband&#39;s idea of the perfect vacation ... packing out sparsely &amp; nearly escaping death.  More of a Naked &amp; Afraid type, while I want to read on the beach.  Why we are ex&#39;es, THAT -- and a whole slew of things we just did diferently. .😥

So because you feel the need or &quot;right&quot; fucked as it is, to ride in their home.
scary AF
Hey man appreciate the unique footage but the camera quality was a bit off. Wish you could have focused more on the bear.
Boring
F&#39;ing Horror Film!
Brilliant to go directly downhill off trail rather than staying on trail. Split second decisions are best sometimes.
People ought to fear God like that! Proverbs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=550">9:10</a> &quot; The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy isunderstanding. &quot;
always carry a sidearm in the woods....these animals aint playin around
Yeah don’t continue down the smooth  open bike path, go down the hill covered with trees and other vegetation, that’ll make you go faster.
Bear spray😂😂😂😂 WHAT A JOKE...500S&amp;W IS MORE LIKE IT
Should&#39;ve worn the brown pants
Looked like a really ferocious charge - If he could have just held his ground for 10 seconds more
You can just record the bear with out running away like a crazy person
I was hoping Jason Vorhees would show up!
Well I guess the grizzly bear didn&#39;t want you dead ...but why ?.....because you&#39;re not .dead
Well that was about the stupidest video I&#39;ve ever watched
You did the very last thing you should... off the trail into the woods ..if he&#39;d intended to, you&#39;d of been dinner dude
All he wants is a hug 😠 you  bear-aphobic 😠
4.33 minutes of life lost thanks!!
European here: Why the fuck are you goin into woods where bears live?
Wheres fucking khabib when ya need him
Winnie the Poo and Yogi were after lunch! and I’m not talking about no picnic baskets booboo!
He just went oh shit then falls down a hill lol
Next time, just outride the bear on the trail, son!
And that is how theexpert level run : &quot;the bear chase was created&quot;
I&#39;m just wondering how I would have explained the doo-doo💩 like substance running down my leg when I got home😂😂
A- you were not charged by a bear.<br>B - you could have peddled your ass down the trail with your panties full of shit.<br>Dipshit.
and for the love of everything bring a gun
we have no business that deep in the woods anyway
Hod damn she got close.
That&#39;s when I would go home., sell the bike and find a new hobby.
Is it one of those bears that rides bikes, wanted theirs? 🐻🚴 . I been to the Smoky Mountains. Black bears there. I didn&#39;t see any. Still, felt safter there than the city.
It’s fucking little hat boys wearing so much curious if they’re going to get hurt riding a bike we didn’t use no protective gear and we didn’t get hurt and we rode her bike’s more than you ever will you clowns are so goddamn stupid asshole fucking asshole I know it’s pathetic if your scared to death about hurting your little head that don’t even get on the bike to begin with you fucking clown
That&#39;s what the Canadians do best in danger,...run.
Could have been skinned from cleaning the trails up, but I doubt it. Looks to me like a lot of bear scrapes and marks in the beginning of the video.
Hecc
well at least you had a friend with you
The bear was just minding his own business... 😁
Yeah that bear was fake ive seen it in like 3 other video coming down the same angle but with different people
You city slickers really don&#39;t know shit about bears! Running away only triggers their hunting instinct and they will go after you. You have to go/ride directly at them! They aren&#39;t expecting that. It will totally irritate them since they aren&#39;t used to being charged and it will make them retreat.
I don&#39;t how they do it,but I think alot of these are fake.if it was that easy to get away ,how to bears or mountain lions kill people????and if u got chased by a grizzly wanting to EAT u,u gonna be calm and hang around??
Wow 😮 if that happened  to me I’d be scared out of my mind glad you guys are ok and safe! 👍😱
Brakes - sound just like baby Deer cry
Chicken sh.. walking up to hide behind friend. Stay separate to confuse bear. Don&#39;t make it go after friend - font move. But threatening it you endanger your braver smarter friend.
So fake. You can see his tennis shoes under the costume
This is as fake as my grandmas couch
If that beast charged full steam ahead...no spray would stop it before it reached you dude. Down that hill???? She would take a good swing and most probaly hit target.
Fake
We&#39;re you wearing brown pants because I bet u are now
Should have drawn your anti-bear circle.
What a waste of 4.33 mins of my life. Fucking loser!
I can agree with the guy above it would be nice to get a little more video of the bear charge barely got a glimpse of it next time stay a little bit longer focused on the bear charging thank you.
Lucky you, you
She was just trying to save her cubs who made noice before she came ..people in the comment section showing of their knowledge of guns ..which is the best to use against them when in danger ..Just saying but it gets to dark when you place a human and think that the mother is not able to think property as a normal human and thought that you are going to harm her children and she protected her by whatever she thought was correct ..and you thought being a intelligent person not to be little generous step out and take decision rather than kill her ..u may not relate that because you think there life is nothing compared to yours
Hope you brought the guns
<b>O~O</b><br><br>Remember- the most dangerous land animal <b>ON THE PLANET</b>
He just wanted a hug!
...lol!
Shiiiiiiit 😂😂
This has been the only appropriate wild animal encounter I have view today. Not only did you possibly save your own lives but you saved the bears. If it had charged further it may have been put down. I hope your outdoor activities have been fantastic.
Wow
Exxxxxtra fake
Puta que pariu!
My legs started aching when he was cycling up the hill...
Ryli
What&#39;s actually the best thing to do if one meets a bear? play dead, stand there, stand behind a tree, climb a tree?
Do you want to go back?<br><br>Nah.. let&#39;s just pitch a fucking tent!
Alguém 2018, Alguém brasileiro aí??ksks??
Idiots

Got your 🐻 spray he’s not e  v e   N interest in you
Should have ran upto the bear and punched it to assert dominance
Be funny if the bears stole their bikes.
Seriously 6 million people watched this crap? Give me a fucking break and 2 pussies on mountain bikes pathetic!
P
The grizzly heard so much about the fish with a bicycle he wanted a bike too.
SO YA HAVE time after to watch and not get the hell back on your bike and BomB THAT TRAIL SON....shake my head...lol...

&quot;Mountain biking&quot; makes no sense on trails.  Hike instead.
Hit and run Vancouver
Carry guns you idiots
Fuck dude, I would keep a gun on me if i knew bears inhabited this area.
And this is why I live in Chicago
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMa5-n2OVc&amp;t=30">0:30</a> I thought the brakes was a woman yelling &quot;Big bear!&quot;  from a distance... 😐<br><br><br><br><br><br>Send help
That&#39;s how you do it just be quiet
See they&#39;re doing the right thing by stopping staying still because most Grizzlies will not attack. And if you&#39;re in a forestry area with Rangers they won&#39;t they will remove bears that are vicious most he&#39;s barely just wanting food and they&#39;re probably chasing something else not you but you react I just got upset some people that were Taurus that were taking over a riverbed so many of them that the bear couldn&#39;t even get to the water to get his fish that he was hungry for and that&#39;s all he wanted to try to get away from all these people and it was a Grizzly but these people all started going her friends yes it&#39;s got a few people that are filming this we&#39;re out of your car you probably be dead because you cannot be noisy you just be quiet if you have to lay down it&#39;ll go away you pray to God it goes away but normally if you&#39;re in a national park they are lift Grizzlies that are mean out of there the most Grizzlies and stuff don&#39;t want a problem with people people are in you know taking over there where they grew up that&#39;s all they know
Get you some bear Spray my man..its expensive as fuck but will save your life.
Only wanted a hug
<b><i>This one always gets my heart pumping!! Super scary!! Lol</i></b>
I&#39;m not sure why the guy freaked out so bad, the bear probably wanted to know what kind of shocks he had on his bike. No big deal.
