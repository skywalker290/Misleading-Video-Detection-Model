<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=430">7:10</a> fact check so no one&#39;s confused: That&#39;s UP TO 128GB of storage. It starts at 64GB, which is a little soft.
Is this a good phone for YouTube videos.
Idk if I should buy it in 2022 since it&#39;s cheap right now
Wish someone had told me that the radar is deactivated in my region before buying
Head bazel is bigger than the chin bazel<br><br>I love that........
2021: bought the phone again. the feature actually works 95% now. it&#39;s actually amazing.
Pixel: why is the chin so big you don&#39;t have to make it symmetrical<br>Pixel 4: WHERES THE CHIN
Uncommon&quot;&quot;&quot;
Am I the only person that actually believes telephoto is more important? On every other phone I rarely use ultra wide but I love telephoto for portraits
Love this phone . Have the 128 GB storage. Your turning into an apple fanboy mate.  Software-wise google is still way ahead of apple.
Still I watch back your old videos
I know the only reason why you arent impressed<br>The didn&#39;t make a matte black option
i hope this isnt a stupid question, never had a google pixel phone but<br>can you share the phone because of the facial recognition, can you turn off the feature? on the phone...
GL
I think the design of this phone except the front is reallyy good
Man rants about phone....first world problems! 🤔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=207">3:27</a> a year later &amp; its a quick u turn on that decision
I think the 2,800mAH battery is fine because my iPhone X has a similar battery capacity (I believe 2716mAh) and after four years of using, I still have no battery issues.
I thought you mean google apps by Gaps <br>The rom / root guy inside me
Who else read it as Google and Maps?
Watching this on my 4XL lmao
This phone looks like from 2009
Me :- Interestingly watching this video<br>Marques :- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=248">4:08</a><br>Me :- all right im out.
You where swiping your hand to high I have one and you need to be close to it
Its almost like google wanted the pixel 4 to suck
I&#39;ve always wanted a pixel because they integrate android so well.
Was planning to buy Pixel 4 XL but there&#39;s just so many &quot;meh&quot; reviews about it so I had to go with OnePlus 7T the closest to stock Android with a little customization here and there, but I hope the Pixel 5 XL will make a comeback
I just got the 4xl for 599.00. For me now it&#39;s worth the 💰! I let you know how I like it up against my s10+?
Greatest phone of 2019. I love my Google pixel 4 xl
What’s that sticking out of his Nose 👃!!! Can’t unseee it ahhhhhhh 😱
What’s that sticking out of his Nose 👃!!! Can’t unseee it ahhhhhhh 😱
That&#39;s some jacksfilm level forehead right there 😂
They definitely cut corners on this phone.   But definitely worth it now when it&#39;s on sale for 599!
I absolutely love my Pixel 4A!!!! I started out as a iPhone user. Got bored of them. Switched to Android. Tried a OnePlus and a Samsung. Didn&#39;t like the interface.  Really sluggish and &quot;clanky&quot;  Bought a Pixel 4 XL. I love it!!!!  Back to that premium iPhone feel but with the freedom of Android. Great battery much better than any other Android phone. Recommend to anyone! The software is what&#39;s worth the money.
Can i get one
lol google hardware is stupid. even one plus have better android functions and better hardware for half the price.
I think they reason why Apple is really good is by making simple small changes to each new phone they release. They don’t want to jump onto every other companies hype. Like built in screen fingerprint or pop up selfie cam.
I feel personally attacked lol
Is it compatible with Boost Mobile?
Where’s the gaps part?
Pixel 4 price has dropped significantly last few months and there were few software updates. Considering all this do you still think pixel 4 worth the price ? Thanks !
Can you recommend me to buy google pixel 4 for $ 515? Or pixel 3a xl at $ 370?   Or can you recommend another phone with a camera like the pixel?
bonjour je vien du Québec plus présisément de Montréal et j aime beaucoup l&#39;éléctronique et je regarde defois tes vidéos
Now that the price is all the way down to 299.00 (at T-Mobile), this suddenly seems viable.  :-)  I am an iOS/MacOS guy, really, but I like to have a Google Android device of recent vintage just so I know how it works and what they&#39;re doing.  So the Pixel 4&#39;s replacing my aging V30 as a play Android device.
Pixel 4 probably have the best software but poor in hardware.
Review of the note Ted
the gif at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=543">9:03</a> sums it up
The only problem I have with this phone is the big forehead and the small battery.
I bet new Pixel 4 as scrap as all gadgets from Google. I have Pixel 3 XL and I cannot express how much I hate this garbage. Just money on wind. The battery is in couple in 4-5 hours, the performance is lower than in mine iPhone 6. Bluetooth so stupid - sometimes cannot connect to my car or 0<br>Pixel Buds headphones (this one even worse than Pixel phone).<br>Google should apologise for Earth for using sources in such useless way.
Clean you nose before marking videos
This phone is terrible. Lets be real. And i hate saying that since ive had the Nexus 5, then Nexus 5x, and ive been waiting and waiting and waiting for something to replace my Nexus 5X but google just cant deliver. Now ive got a Samsung A51 - the price is right, the specs are really good, but it has all that bloat ware you would expect which is a big minus and why i prefer pure google phones. But i couldnt wait any longer :) So A51 it is!
These hand gestures kind of remind me of my old Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which even Samsung abandoned. Anyway, gimmicks are why I chose to go with OnePlus 7T when I replaced my LG G6.
My favourite android phone
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s 2+ zoom
If the pixel didn&#39;t have the huge bezel on top and had an ultra wide this wouldve been an awesome phone, but it sucks.
Wow for 799 this phone sucks
Very googly glossy just black. Very googly way. Lol
You missed the mark on this one yo 😬 @Marques
The good part of the phone :<br>-The back looks good(seriously, I do love the camera cutout)<br>-Stock Andrio<br>-90hz<br>-Great Camera<br>Bad:<br>-Battery Life (no battery no life)<br>-No Wide angle <br>-Big forehead (I dont mind slim forehead but that forehead is huge)
Thanks
Pixel 4 Is too expensive is it worth It to upgrade?<br>I have an S9 fron Samsung
And another copy.
Galaxy A50 6GB ram 4000mah 128 storage for $300 now🔥😂😂
That small battery in pixel 4 is actually a physical version of digital well being so that you dont use your phone for long
Yeah, without ultra-wide, no free unlimited backup, and with the cost at $700, nah, I will wait for the Pixel 5 and the Samsung S11 to see what the competition has for us.
My bottom left speaker seems to be spoilt :(
Literally everything except the one plus 7pro and the s10s have kind of disappointed me Ross year.
nice that they are now forcing you to give them your face data
This phone looks like the IPhone 11 leaks when it wasn’t out..
appreciate the review, confirms im not upgrading from pixel 3 ill wait for pixel 5
Am not impressed with any of Google phones. I don&#39;t see anything new?
November 24 Google Fi, I am an existing customer and was just able to order the Pixel 4 xl  128 GB with Fi and $500 Fi credit!!! Amazing deal, good till December 2.
After using  iPhone 11, I think TelePhoto is more important than the wide angle
Does anyone think that it looks the same as the iPhone
pixel is too expensive!  there is a realme x2 pro phone, it costs much less and is better in terms of characteristics than a pixel!  there is confirmation on my channel!)
lol
Message for those who criticize design of the pixel 4<br>Apple have a prototype of iPhone without notch and they will market it once the solution to delete the notch are found
I think it is the best phone I have ever owned for my purposes. Battery life is not an issue for my lifestyle. The storage ia not an issue because I save almost everything on the cloud. More storage is just a waste for me. Functionality is the best I have ever experienced. There are only gaps for people the phone is wrong for. For some of us it&#39;s the perfect phone. People should buy what is right for them. No need for people to be disappointed with a product that was not designed for there life style.
They fucked YouTube up. They took google plus. Now they’re fuckin the phones up too?!?! PASS!!!
It won’t be expensive for long. Google had it the Pixel 3 family on sale for like 2-300 off for most of its life cycle.
Send me a phone for free..
Oh please, certain phones have mega telephoto &amp; wide angle &amp; extras.....they had to cut costs. 😔  Bummer!
The title is oddly literal after JerryRigEverything did his thing.
My girlfriends dad meeting for the first time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=70">1:10</a>
I bought the Google pixel 3 when it came out after watching your review of it.  My husband just bought the 4 but some of these new features seem like a negative change to me.  For example,  the face recognition instead of fingerprint.  I often give my baby the phone to play with while he is on my lap so I can put on his shoes, etc. but I like that he can&#39;t unlock it so that he can&#39;t delete my apps, photos, etc.  If me just being there would unlock it, that would be a disadvantage for my needs.
They actually charge more for this than iPhone 11. 👀😂😂😂
Google: let&#39;s remove fingerprint sensor.<br><br>Chinese companies (ZTE): let&#39;s put two fingerprint sensors.
My oppo a77 is better
Trash to many features.
<i>&quot;Orange&quot;</i><br><b>LTT has entered the chat</b>
Awesome like always buuuuuut that white nose hair is driving me crazy hahaha
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=489">8:09</a> he has no cell data on the status bar
Marques, I had the Pixel 3 and have been using the 4 now for a couple weeks. The battery lasts me all day like the 3. The face unlock is fantastic, by the time I lift the phone its open right to the main screen. That was something I didn&#39;t like about the Iphone X. The grip on the 4 is way better than the 3. I don&#39;t understand what your all complaining about! The reviewers for this phone had me almost sending it back until I used it. I think you reviewers need to modify what your expectations are. I almost passed on a very good cell phone. I&#39;m disappointed that these reviews now are becoming hyper critical of new devices. Like Linus Sebastian used to be an upbeat positive reviewer and now I don&#39;t even watch his reviews anymore because I know what he will do. Sure hope you don&#39;t go down this road.
Shit man, i don&#39;t care about this. I care about THE WINDS OF WINTER
I bought the pixel2xl in 2017. Nothing much has changed in two years to be frank. I will buy a new phone in 2021 only.
Is my phone a joke to you?
I’ve already seen this design somewhere
this is just a nice version of tailosive techs video about the pixel 4.
That album cover at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=350">5:50</a> is creepy as..<br><br>Also at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=440">7:20</a>, is it me, or does the screen look off-centre?
I wish samsung phones  had that flat screen nowdays.. s9plus owner good luck finding a good screen protector or tempered glass plus that creepy back on pixel 4 is good
Pixel 2 is still the best pixel.
2020 is the year for flagship upgrades....and flying cars!
Which one do you recommend? 3-3xl-4-4xl or other?
Quack 😎
love it but that forehead kills me inside
Pixel 4 is a joke and a disappointment like no ultra-wide lens, which every company has one now including Apple&#39;s latest iPhone 11 lineup XD<br><br>Not bright enough and battery&#39;s small :-:
S10 is better
I was just curious if you knew you can turn off the setting where it skips the lock screen with face unlock. I noticed you said it barely shows the lock screen when it unlocks but if you go to lock screen settings you can turn that off and you have to swipe after the face unlock occurs to use the phone

Garmin Vivosmart 4  vs   Apple Watch Series 5 up next?
Please, make Huawei Mate 30 Pro review.
I feel like the Pixel has so much potential to be a major player and they come up short in a few significant ways every year.
Hate the extra bezels on some your videos 😡
Good luck pixel! Lol
The biggest problems with the pixel 4 are the battery and the processor.
Already copying iPhone?
I think companies like samsung, google, and apple underestimate reviewers like you guys. 9 mil subs and they dont think you have an impact? Pfft. I totally judge my next phone off what you guys say. I&#39;ll pass on the google.
This video was published on my birthday 🎂 🥳
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=422">7:02</a> I love that self-balance scooter shot.🙂
Is it possible to e.g scroll up or down websites? <br>Imagine that you are doing cake and read the recipe. You have your hands covered with cake and want to move the website with recipe down a bit. Is it possible with radar, or can it only switch off alarms and music?
i just got the Pixel 4 today upgrading from IPhone SE and i couldn&#39;t be happier <br>i know most people are underwhelmed but i love the phone <br>its crazy fast apps have never loaded quicker in my opinion<br>the thiccer top bezel was weird at first but i got over it really quick<br>the only thing i don&#39;t like is i finally had to give up an aux port so i need to buy bluetooth headphones (but obviously people have had this for awhile I&#39;m just late to the game)
I&#39;ve had every pixel so far. Love them.  Removing  the fingerprint unlock is a deal breaker and I won&#39;t be getting the pixel 4. Why  not have it on the power button like the pixel Slate? So Disappointed.
Crazy to think we are already at the pixel 4 as I watch from my nexus 6 lol
4head phone
Can you charge it wireless?
really like the design of this one these soft look is dope
I guess I was the only one that noticed his nose 🤦🏾‍♀️👀
this phone sucs
Am I the only one who wants to be able to look at their phone WITHOUT it unlocking? That&#39;s why I want fingerprint, not face unlock

Yeah, that&#39;s a no for me dawg.
gaps with one p?
Nothing much of a change but I&#39;m still happy with my Nexus 6p ☺️
iPhone 11 pro max copy’s are started coming 😂😂
Can&#39;t wait for the night time camera comparison between the iPhone 11 Pro and the Pixel 4. Should be interesting to see the results.
Fuck you
its a fucking camera bitch  fuck you and the rest of the industry  who cares about the fucking camera
Pixel 4 doesn&#39;t have the best camera, doesn&#39;t have a fingerprint sensor/scanner, doesn&#39;t have a wide angle camera, doesn&#39;t have a MATTE BLACK DESIGN!<br>I guess only thing I&#39;ll wait for us the ported apps on XDA.<br><br>Edit: FUCK! THAT RADAR TECH IS REALLY LIT!
Bezels are good.<br><br>When will people learn? You need something to hold on you while you&#39;re using the device. It can&#39;t be all screen... That&#39;s ridiculous.
Glad I got the 3a.
Thanks..
Pixel should learn from chinese phone for design. Look like outdated. The price.....Oooooch.
they just missed it &quot;matte black&quot;
Nice review! Where can i find this Wallpaper?
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=195">3:15</a> that guy was recording you
If you bought a smartphone in 2017  ... keep on keeping on.  Because these companies ain&#39;t doing shit to warrant dropping another another 1000 bucks.
Technology is always going backwards these day.
I feel so much biased towards pixel now that I kinda wished he actually dropped the orange phone on the stairs.
The disappointment....<br><br><br><br><br>HARDWARE???????
Mkbhd, im planning to buy a phone.. pls help..<br>Iphone 11 pro max or Pixel 4 xl, gv me ur choice of phone. Thanks
soooo.....no fingerprint authentication for payments and stuff?!!<br>Another joke by Google.<br>They should market it as a photographers device as that&#39;s what is good for. <br>Peace
$899?! Has all the other flagship beat except oneplus
Marty Mcfly &amp; I are going back to get a Nexus.
Pixel fans: So, what&#39;s new this time<br><br><br>Google Mobile VP: We have tried to imitate iPhone&#39;s look even this time
NO HEADPHONES!! Why is no one talking about that. If Apple did it, it would have made headlines!
You sound Bias... if it sucks at his only way of security and it doesnt have fingerprint, and on top Google took the headphone jack away come on man. You have given the Apple iPhone more shit for the same stuff. Come on I come here for unbiased reviews.
Google totally messed up
Please send this device to me. If you can
No ear buds... No ear buds.... Y there&#39;s no ear buds. Y pixel... Y... 😢 😭 😢 😭 😢 😭
I&#39;ve read a lot of comments on here and not impressed with this community&#39;s feedback. You complain about price, there&#39;s not one smartphone out there that&#39;s worth full retail. Find a promo. Don&#39;t compare it to the iPhone 11. It&#39;s not in that phones weight class. It&#39;s comparable to the 11 Pros which it handily beats in almost everything. Higher end Android users will complain about specs. Google&#39;s happy to pick up sales in the highly competitive Android market but they&#39;re here to steal people from Apple. The real cash cow is siphoning off people from the company with the largest market share (US).
The swipe function works better in my galaxy s5 than in the 2019 Pixel 4...really google
Please bro review for one plus 7T
Galaxy s10+ comes out, MKBHD: this is the phone to beat, the bar is set VERY high. Comes October,  as usual and as all other youtubers (except unbox therapy), they ignore the comparison with galaxy. Or even the galaxy note for that matter, which came out like a couple of months ago which is still fresh,and no I&#39;m not talking camera. Overall comparison. It&#39;s only fair to stay true to &quot;your own remarks&quot;.  Go figure.
Seems like googles phone last year was better..
I think we can sometimes tend to loose sight of what Google mission with the Pixel line of phones. With so many phones being introduced on a consistent bases it&#39;s easy to compare or want to compare them. But Google&#39;s mission is to show case A.I. and its own software because Google makes money on ANY smartphone sale with the exception of the iPhone, which Google considers it main competition. Google is not producing the Pixel line to compete against OnePlus or any other flagship Android phone because Google owns Android! So when you choose to buy a OnePlus instead of the Pixel phone Google still says &quot;thank you&quot; you just bought an Android phone!!!. The Pixel should really only be compared to the iPhone because Google is targeting current iPhone users not other Android users. So buy that Samsung, or OnePlus or any other Android Phone... guess what...you just bought a Google phone anyway...you just don&#39;t get the benefit of experiencing Android at its best which is what  the Pixel line of phones is about... Android untainted..
Ive ALWAYS said google pixel looks like a bootleg iphone in the hardware department and now theres no chance you can deny that i mean i thought that was an iphone pro and you would have fooled me if you didnt say its not...<br><br>Other than not wanting to make Google more rich than it already is like come on be at least a bit more subtle in your copying of iphone and be more original (ps im an android user before androiders get mad).
799 for THIS??? No thanks
Google: I&#39;m a simple man, I see something useful, I mock it and then copy it a year later
unsure about something, so theres two speakers on the bottom and one in the ear piece?<br>sound firing from 3 different locations?<br>*in terms of music/video
Phone appears to be very 2015ish...
I don&#39;t mind large forehead on the front if someone can give me a wide angle front camera as good as the back camera.
Interested to see what Google does with 5G on pixel in the future. Lots of misses on this flagship.
Yeah yeah yeah but does it have a head phone jack?
I&#39;m Brazilian, If i buy pixel 4 at USA, the radar will work om Brazil? Or other countries like India and mexico, that they are not selling the pixel 4?
@mkbhd flossy got the gestures working great in his vid.
4Head
Seems like Google just threw this together in an afternoon and figured that was good enough.
Like does google not know there’s people like me that turn off cameras whilst half asleep? They’ve made it easier for me to do this. And that’s not a good thing
The ugliest phone😜😜😜😂😂
The Pixel guy thinks 2x telephoto zoom is more important than wide-angle. As if you can&#39;t have both.
Google should just partner with Samsung and let Samsung creat the hardware a d let Google create the software...no more bixbi only the assistant and all the latest specs using stock Android and all the great things Google does with it&#39;s software. Call it the galaxy pixel the words first super phone.
Wireless charging/sharing ?
This phone is already dated. We need to see pixel 5
No one:<br><br><br><br>Mkbhd: so I’ve been using pixel 4 for five years now
You should make a video on smartphone privacy and security, it&#39;s a big issue these days, hacking and all the intelligence services stealing and looking to our data without permissions. Tracking us and our locating without us knowing. There are lots of people who don&#39;t know about privacy on smartphone theses days.
I understand that Google Pixel is 800 USD in US but for a first time that is phone that when you go to UK, Germany or else in the world it is still being sold for 800 USD so the price is persistent.<br>For example last year pixel 3 was 800 USD in USA and almost 1100 USD in UK, do you think that is fair pricing? Now Pixel 4 may be priced higher than iPhone 11 in USA, but that is only there because the iPhone 11 price changes from 750 USD to almost 950 USD and that places the Pixel 4 a lot cheaper than the overall competitors.
Any word on how haptic motor is compared to iPhone?

Thanks for that radar - NSA
you have something on your nose, on the left side
No front facing speakers, might as well call it  the Apple Pixel 12
Samsung s4 feature 😂😂😂😂🤣
well pixel was never good......you were the one who created all the hype for pixel from the beginning.
Pixel 4: exists<br>Mkbhd: immabout to end this man&#39;s whole career
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=365">6:05</a> the white smudge shifts as it detects your hand, you can see on some of your attempts it does detect som motion but not all. Other attemps, none at all. I think the key factor with the radar sensor is frequency and field. I can see that if you move your hand too fast you might not get enough of a detection, think moving an object at greater than 1/60 of a second across a field of a camera that is filming at 60 FPS
Dam you just made me wait for the next Pixel ! Pretty disappointed
Battery life? Tell me about battery life.
Google pixel 4 XL camera &gt; iPhone 11 pro Max camera
If the 128gb pixel xl was 699 or 649 and the prices adjusted accordingly, THEN it would be a decent phone. As it stands though, its a joke, like every other pixel phone has always been. Google honestly doesn’t give a shit about the pixel line.
Android fanboy here, and this is the first time I admit Apple made a better (and cheaper!) phone this year
Fine print: Swipe gestures do not work if the radar detects an Apple watch in the room.
MKBHD you should do a comparison between both Face unlock
Where&#39;s the Post Embargo Review???
It&#39;s really weird. It&#39;s an inverted phone. It makes me wanna turn the phone upside-down.
for $200  is good 😂😂
As a cyclist/motorcyclist/snowboarder I would like to know if the face-unlock works with your face partially covered by a helmet, hoodie, snow-mask, goggles, etc. in those use cases, it is useful to have the finger print unlock.
I just dont get it. It looks like they have so much money to butn that Google just blows off phone building. I dont get it! I want one, but my G7, in my opinion, is far superior and I only paid $210 for it.
Why this Pixel 4 looks like my Redmi 6A with the chin trimmed up on the the screen 😂 ?
I wish that i could shoot a 90 fps 1080p video and see the video in 90hz :)
nothing revolutionary or worthwhile to upgrade
when you notice that booger  you can&#39;t un-notice.
Video quality ....for brolls
Im not gonna buy this shit
the air swipe is not really useful .. cool.. just not useful
Headphone jack
Hello MKBHD, I really hope you cover the battery performance of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL in detail. I am especially concerned for the Pixel 4, it has a 90Hz display and a small 2800mAh battery. I am not sure how can optimizations and variable refresh rate save this abysmal battery capacity to last throughout a working day.
You absolutely do not like it.
am i the only one to notice he has a boogie? hehe
I&#39;ll wait for pixel 5. Thank you.
What the fuck is that on the top 😟<br>So you guys follow take one step forward.right after that take 5 steps back <br>Fuck you Google
Are they trying to beat Apple&#39;s disappointing people of the year award?
iPhone 11 over this 😂
I didn&#39;t care about the Pixel 4 before its announcement, and this video has helped me realise why. It&#39;s just a boring phone.
My least favorite feature of a smartphone is the auto features and intuitive options. And that is the trend of all manufactures. Frustrating! I am more than capable of operating a &quot;Smartphone&quot; all by my self. One of the main reasons I don&#39;t buy Samsung phones packed full of bells and whistles that I will never use. Have manufactures not heard the calls from millions for an easy to use basic smartphone for a reasonable price with a good camera. You know, for those of use that still have lives beyond the little screen in our hands.
Google is copying apple every year!<br><br>Pixel 2 xl - ditched the headphone jack <br>Pixel 3 xl - embraced the notch<br>Pixel 4 xl - copied the square camera design from iphone11 pro!
Please do away with the pauses. It’s cheesy and tarnishes your image as a serious tech critic.
I didn&#39;t like about the Pixel 4 is its price and its battery coz according to its price it should have a Snapdragon 855+ and 4000 MAh battery..
I want to know what happens when you say that this display is 90Hz or 120Hz. What does that actually mean in terms of smartphone performance and which quantity is good like 90Hz is better or 120? I have this little query and I shall be thankful if it can be cleared. Thanks, and Cheers !!
Smartphones incredible camera is useless on facebook with its terrible photo compression smh facebook really suck
Did anyone think of No Life Shaq when he said &quot;That&#39;s tough&quot; ? 😂😂
You know u r doing it wrong when it&#39;s more expensive than Apple, lol
600$ tops, take it or leave it
When you&#39;re Soo into customising your phone that you read the Gaps as Gapps(GApps, if you know lol)<br><br><br>iPhone users can continue scrolling. <b>Pity feelzz</b>
What&#39;s your phone
Does it have power share to charge watch or buds
Everybody showing back of this phone because front side looks ugly.
which phone should I buy note 10+ or pixel 4xl?
It&#39;s Ugly!!!!!!!
Regarding the voice memo app: I am into genealogy so I want to get a oral history from my dad, and was going to see what I could get in the marketplace. (it&#39;s strange since it&#39;s really quite timely being that is something I&#39;m actually looking for.) <br><br>I have a couple questions concerns though: how long is the recording times/ how big can the files be? Does it allow voice to-text-transcripts? If there are transcripts, where does it save to?<br><br>This could be what I&#39;m looking for, but I don&#39;t want to get my hopes up.
my dream phone 1 like 1 pray i get it
The only time i felt, MKBHD is being paid by Apple.
No wide angle == Fail.
Google downgrading a phone (lock8bg the portraid to the 2x)? That must be new cof cof
You were doing the hand gestures wrong. If you go to Flossy Carter&#39;s video on the Pixel 4, he was doing it with eas. Small things like that make me gravitate more towards his content versus any other Youtuber.
I really don&#39;t get why companies think we prefer a big vessel.... I can live without saving the 0.0005 secs that the technology on that part of the phone is gooing to save me. Do these people ever discuss this with anyone outside of their bubble? I&#39;m an iPhone user but I would love to have the scrreen to body ratio that the Samsung Note has.
this is the first time iv been tempted to move to apple
I imagine that buying a Google phone is like buying what was hot the year before for the price of the actual year.
Everyone- wideangle<br>Google- it&#39;s not in my radar
Please do a battery test of pixel 4
I’d rather them be glossy than matte so if I get it I’m getting black
This phone has more headroom than a 32 bit floating point DAW
Bit gutted, pixel phones seemed to keep getting better and better and this one is incredibly underwhelming for me
Hey soooo when’s the LG. V50 getting a review, its honestly one of if not the best phone this year, minus the software which lags behind but they always bring all the features from previous years
“I feel slighted” lol
No not like face unlock. I just got over having Finger print on the pixel 3
apple: lets sell costly phones with little to no capablities<br>google: hold my beer<br>samsung from the outside: hahahahahahahahahahahaha kids
this phone makes the pixel 3 look godly
Google is  so silly not to include in ultra-wide giving iPhone 11 a big edge. An ultra-wide is just for &#39;fun&#39;? Common... he should resign or be sacked
Why ain&#39;t you making 60 fps videos man in 2019?
The orange goes hard ngl. Shouldve gotten that over the black
Come on Marques! You’ve gone ahead and did a new pixel thoughts and review soon how can you miss the HUAWEI MATE 30 PRO 😢🤔🤦🏾‍♂️
Yo this phone is so ugly
Is it better than the pixel 3 xl?
IPhone: Get your kidneys ready iPhone 11 is here, we&#39;ll sell highly overpriced phones.<br>Google pixel 4: Am i a joke to you.
😍😍😍 beautiful phone
Oneplus, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi : let&#39;s make futuristic phones with beautiful display pop, shark fin, triple and quad cameras with all lenses n 20w, 30W, 65w fast charging<br>Google: Done with the single camera, now time to copy iPhone 11 design and put two cameras this time with pathetic big bazels and big chin and small battery 😂😂
CLEAN UR NOSE :(
Ahem the motion sensors are recycled ideas from the galaxy S4, that&#39;s disappointing
I&#39;ve got a OnePlus 6T and really like the new design. The iPhone 11 is way uglier with its big notch and the thick bazels.
Been there done that, next!
Kinda sad. Wanted to upgrade from my pixel 2 but will probably stick with it until it dies.
Actually miss my s3 and s4 now
the samsung galaxy s4 had those motion gestures years ago
google is going to sell the scans of everyone&#39;s face that uses these
I can&#39;t wait for a phone cameras comparison video! Literally waiting for that review to decide what phone to buy. Is pixel still in the game?
Ahh man. I was expecting this to be great. I thought it might trump my One Plus 7 Pro  but it&#39;s weaker in every way. Perhaps the standard photo lens is better? I&#39;ve just got Android 10 Oxygen too. Seems the same as 9 but with good features removed?
I found the booooger!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=105">1:45</a> You&#39;re welcome.
Google died when he introduced the colours 😂😂😂
Okay so i guess google is trying to sell something before its time.
Man, Google really dropped the ball this year.
Buddy listens to William Eyelash🤢😂<br>Love these videos though!
no headphone jack ?? no ty
how does it compare to iphone in snapchat and other popular apps
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=210">3:30</a> that footage looks so early 2000s
I read gasps 😂
The price is too expensive. They should do like 🍎. Announce a cheaper version like the Pixel 3a. They missed that opportunity at the launch event.
Do you get unlimited video and photos space in Google Photos with the purchase of the Pixel 4 or 4XL?
Maaan such a letdown for me. I LOVED Pixel 1 but they haven&#39;t impressed me since. Here&#39;s hoping the 5 is good!
Will they have a budget phone like pixel 3a?
No fingerprint unlock ? :(
Have you notice that security probleme about to unloclk the phone with closed eyes
Google&#39;s phone division is what happens when people have no passion for the product their creating or any consequences for failure.
I can’t believe how close you are to 10 MILLION subs!!!
They copied apple -_-
Just another copy of the iPhone unfortunately
Damn google users made fun of the iPhone camera and they also got the huge square
That face reading is creepy
i really like the look of this phone. Note 10+ screen on this body and color and that wouldve one badass looking phone. Samsung does the worst color choices. Matte phones are so much more muted and stylish
Still feel the best looking pixel were the 3 and the 2XL. Not forgetting the Pixel 4 looses original quality / 4K backup on photos. What a bleh!
So happy with my Mi 9t and it has triple cameras
Download gcam and pixel experience rom. We got pixel device. 🤔
I&#39;d say the design doesn&#39;t match the price. The OnePlus 7T Pro is probably the most beautiful phone of the year with an all-screen display and the pop-out selfie cam and it costs the same like a Pixel 4 that is very barebones in terms of design and haptics. Google has the best camera every year but they need to step up their design game and wide-angle should be a standard  these days.
So, can someone explain the purpose of these two white thingies that appear in the corners at the bottom when you go back to home screen when using the new swipe control? When i first updated to A10 and tried it, i though this is some visual bug, but it is still there. Some sort of indicator. But why? How is it useful? And it is not showing up in older 3 or 2 button control scheme.
Only way I see those hand gestures coming in handy is when I&#39;m driving doing Uber and I&#39;m trying to drive and navigate my phone at the same time
The swipe is still in Beta
I&#39;m mad about that glossy black too bro
Google leaked to much information that no o ones surprised at the phone or was wowed
So it just looks like a cheap iPhone 11
I bought the pixel 3 xl a few months back when verizon had it on sale for 500$. The biggest problem with the pixel 3 is it&#39;s ram management. It only allows two apps to be open in the background at any given time. If you try to have more than two apps open, it will auto close the third. I would love to see if the 6gb of ram does anything for multi tasking in the pixel 4!
Wallpaper?
Gapeing assholez
Pixel kibhkicht
I&#39;m totally out of focus here. does he have something in his nose???
All these apple fanboys In the comments 🤕
HAHA.. LG provided the swipe thing, a headphone jack and a lot more. It lacks software support though sadly..
No audio jack and SD slot AGAIN?! ... I&#39;m completely and utterly DONE with Google. MOVING on to the Librem 5, geez it even has a removable battery! That&#39;s nutz!! 😲
Love how everyone is trashing a phone they haven&#39;t even touched, sure it has a ton of drawbacks but once you start using a phone you begin to love it. I was wary on OnePlus but gave them a shot and have been using them since, switching to this from my OnePlus 6t though because I wanna try something new but like to have my phone actually updated instead of waiting a year...*cough* Samsung <b>cough</b>
Pubg with extreme frame rate ! 🤔
bad phone, bad design, bad work google
Why don&#39;t Google scrap the normal camera and only do wide and telephoto instead..?
In countries where the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) limit is 1.6 W/kg averaged over one gram of tissue. The highest SAR values for the Pixel 4  are 1.20 W/kg when used near your ear or 1.34 W/kg at a distance of 1.0 cm (0.4 in) from your body. The highest SAR values for the Pixel 4 XL are 1.35 W/kg when used near your ear or 1.20 W/kg at a distance of 1.0 cm (0.4 in) from your body. <br><br>In the countries where the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) limit is 2.0 W/kg averaged over ten gram of tissue, the highest SAR values for the Pixel 4  are 1.38 W/kg when used near your ear or 1.42 W/kg at a distance of 5 mm (0.2 in) from your body. The highest SAR values for the Pixel 4 XL are 1.41 W/kg when used near your ear or 1.39 W/kg at a distance of 5 mm (0.2 in) from your body.<br><br><br>NOT REALLY GOOD.
Pixel 4 is probably the WORST flagship of 2019. I was anticipating this phone for ever. Now it&#39;s here and I wish it wasn&#39;t. It&#39;s like Google listened to us, and did everything completely opposite. Smh 🙄
Swiping over phone, i used in 2014 with samsung Galaxy s4
what a fucking disappointment. im glad i got the 3xl, the last true pixel :&#39;(
So disappointing to see Google utterly destroy their value proposition year and year. There is just no reason to want this phone at that price.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=308">5:08</a> I guess they never miss huh.
Who cares, how bad you feel about the phone, its a phone....
Mi A3 or Pixel 4? 4030 mah vs 2800 mah
Not better than the pocofone f1
this will sell late hot garbage
ugly as f**k
Are they leaks when Google’s doing the announcements 🤔
Could you please review samsung A70s?
What&#39;s the IP rating? Is it waterproof?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=335">5:35</a> this year is &quot;keep waving to your phone&quot; year.. so funny 😂😂😂
iphone 11 pro max feel bad for google pixel 4xl finally google don&#39;t have the best phone

Have said it before - Surprise ! -<br>Saying it Again -<br>2020 - See Ya Then 😉.<br><br>Thank You Marques 🙂,<br>JL 🕊️
202Syl fans wasupppp??!!
The camera is quite good! But the &quot;no&quot; ultra wide is the most disgusting thing.
Why do they even use something which Samsung used way back in S4? And to be honest it was nothing but a gimmick.
Google: Let&#39;s ruin every banking app that uses fingerprints for biometric authentication! <br><br>Facepalm major.
Marques: goes into a store and they don&#39;t have what he wants in stock<br>Also Marques: I FEEL PERSONALLY ATTACKED
Lamest pixel
Man let&#39;s be real Samsung came up with those gestures 7 years ago
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=354">5:54</a> he&#39;s listening to Billie eilish
This is my next phone.  The pixel camera features are just too good
This phone is just shit
How much of this phones &quot;tweaked software&quot; is a complete gimmick. And how does that justify the price for just meh and honestly lacking hardware. At the end of the day software gets updates, or camera apps ported to other phones. However your stuck with the hardware. Would love to see how the pixel 4&#39;s strong point the camera stacks against the OnePlus 7 pro or 7 t pro with Google camera APK installed. <br>Also, good luck getting Google to honor a hardware warranty through Google Fi, still paying for a faulty P2XL that I have been trying to warranty for almost 2 years with Fi.
&quot;So while wide angle can be fun, we think telephoto is more important&quot; <br><br><br>- Quote of the year.
Seems very disappointing.  YIKES.
I like both the orange and white versions... please do giveaway...😉
Google put more effort in making those pixel pizza box’s than the phone and their presentation, maybe that team should have designed the pixel <br>They backward with a lot for that price point . no front firing speakers , smaller battery 2x vs wide angle , and a radar system for gestures that doesn’t seem to be finished.
Can you revieuw the realme x2 pro?
No wow in 2019
I was going to buy it, but the missing wide-angle camera and the small battery is a no go for me.
Am I the only one, who doesn&#39;t see any difference in phones for the last years?
Just like the overpriced 3 when it came out... It will go on sale for 550 again and again and again
Are companies are compeating for the worst design
That booger though. 😲
Oof it looks cheappppp
Would have upgraded from P3 just to go XL and be shiny and new but removal of fingerprint sensor is a deal breaker
I love my Pixel 3 and one aspect I absolutely love is the front facing speakers. I really don&#39;t like having to cup my hands around my phone to hear videos on my phone. Please compare the Pixel 3 and Pixel 4&#39;s  speakers.
The ego on this guy is as extensive  as his vocabulary
You can actually fake ultrawide lens by software taking multiple shots: panorama mode already does it.
All the negative comments from every review I have seen till now is bcs the people are obsessed with phone with good triple four cameras what for for selfies and freaking social media posting the people are zombies buy your self a DSLR if you want a camera go home plug in and download the photos but no they have to do it straight away in the car,toilet,work place,party,meeting everywhere.Everything is BS in this industry like in the car industry.
ceramic stove designs in 2019.<br>Microwave included in 2030.
The swiping above the screen works on the 2014 Samsung S4. Period.
Why did google copy iPhone? The color range is ugly !
Resolutions of pixel 4xl 1440 or 1800
Will it accept gestures only from the owner&#39;s hands or can anyone do it ?  People around you might mess with you if it does.
⚠️💊Please review the revolutionary flagship Realme X2 Pro with 64 mega pixel camera.⚠️🔭🧲📌
Why are they selling phones when it&#39;s not getting better?
man i did ignore your video 3 times today,and while i was watching some other video it autoplayed,and as usual,your google bashing was up,haha more of an iphone fanboyish stuff since past 2 years,even though comparing iphones now with android is absurd.
Cool , pixel copier 😁
Reminds me of O+ with that swipe thing.
The 855 pluse thing is bullshit and enough with the all glass front i break enough phones as it is!
Google: copy the iPhone 11 .... oh and do away with the headphone jack and make it Face ID...... while you guys are at it copy the AirPods as well but don’t make it super obvious
Does google&#39;s and apple&#39;s designers are same and dumb. They are missing the whole idea of android is ..customisation and u guys are releasing phones same like  Apple. Pixel will die a slow death.
To satisfy us Samsung,Google and apple should do a collaboration and give us the best ever phone.
test it with the new buds
Please take a camera test between iphone 11 pro max and pixel 4 xl
Have always been a fan of Google since start of Nexus ... Can you please let me know why Pixel always stick with low battery storage and also is Pixel 3 xl better than Pixel 4 ... Currently I have pixel  n wish to upgrade (Pixel 4 is not available in India - your thoughts)
Dear MKBHD <br><br>The sensor technology initially introduce way back in 2013 in Samsung Galaxy S4  and eventually they dropped in there subsequent production due to heavy battery drain I hope the same happened to Pixel 4 too since the battery capacity is not huge with today&#39;s market flagship phones <br>I think Google little bit over optimistic about there software side but we know that without proper hardware even you create great software it won&#39;t match performance 😡😡🙄😉
If its apple im pretty sure youre gonna bash that big forehead lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=43">0:43</a> Correct for you young man “so the design” similar to other Pixal phone, No, it’s kind of similar to iPhone 11.   Now similarities boxie camera, non flasher back glass same as iPhone 11.
Google hates their users. I feel this has become obvious over time. It&#39;s why I switched to OnePlus last year.
Apple: “YouTube reviewers think our phone isn’t innovative enough”<br>Google: “Hold my beer”<br><br>Lol still wanna whine about no usb c on iPhone?
Rip iphone
Can you use just the storage for your pictures? It seems you must use google photos  on these phones. I do trust google with my personal photos
Is it worth to upgrade from pixel 3xl to pixel 4 xl?
camera design 100% huawei mate 20
Gesture is working for everyone, but not for you...there must be something wrong...
Google has been dropping the ball since pixel 2
I wonder if you know how many fans you have . I like to watch this channel because your like a extremely nice person.
when are we getting a full review??
I remember how much hate the earlier iPhones would get just before release. This phone must be pretty amazing too.
Nice
Google 2019: the most important is ultrawide camera lens. Pixel 5 xl <br><br>Me: but i just bought pixel 4 xl??????? Ugh
Maybe google have to learn from Samsung and huawei
Telephoto is definitely not more important. You can always zoom digitally, or walk closer. But you CAN&#39;T make the view wider in any other way. It&#39;s the number 1 feature I miss from my curren&#39;t phone&#39;s camera. I always have to back away until I can&#39;t and just have to place the phone against a wall and it&#39;s still not good enough. Wide angle is a MUST over telephoto.
Billie Elish? Really? Jesus christ man, not asking you for a music rec anytime soon. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Ok. Let&#39;s talk about the elephant in the room. The pixel 4 is a waste of money compared to the other flagships and the other android phones.  Simple.
Something irritating is in your nostrils 🤔🤔🤔
It knows when your coming 👀
Can you use face unlock for apps that you use fingerprint for, now? I&#39;d like to see how face unlock works inside a waterproof case? I use one when cycling and naturally fingerprint sensors don&#39;t work through an extra layer of plastic.
No 4k 60fps
I hope to upgrade my pixel 3 but no wide angle and a small battery for 90hz 🤦🏻‍♂️
Lg g8 flop 2.0
This video left me wondering what Google was thinking with this phone. I was looking forward to upgrading to it but I think my OnePlus 7 Pro might be on par with it, if not better, and it&#39;s like $250 cheaper than the Pixel 4 XL.
Nice factual vid brownie
Who is gonna get it for me???
I can&#39;t believe google used air gestures.  Remember when Samsung did that years ago ?
So i guess there&#39;ll be a Pixel 4 pro.
I think motion sense will best be used by helping you go handsfree in the car.
So many people are saying the phone is trash but honestly, it&#39;ll probably end up as his daily driver
Google needs to fire the design team. Their last good phone was the Nexus 6P. If the pixel 4 had front firing speakers, S10 design, add an ultra wide lens, 8 or 12gb ram, 4000+ mAh battery and ultrasonic fingerprint sensor they would&#39;ve had a beast of a phone. IDC about those useless gestures or face id
Gonna have to pass on this one. Maybe Google will get the Pixel 5 right.
Billieeee
the colors are great but the specs and not having ultra wide camera is very disappoint
Um don’t you mean the iPhone 11 pro?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=90">1:30</a>.  It took longer than usual to hear &quot;20-19&quot;... 😂
Better than apple better than apple!
I would love to have an orange phone as long as it&#39;s not the specs on this Google pixel  failed
Apple: here is the all new iPhone 11/ 11 pro.<br><br>“Google pixel 4 literally looks like the new iPhone”<br> <br>Google: the google pixel 4 made the google way. <br><br>&quot;I am dying” 😂
Way to drop the ball Google, try again next year.
Body ratio is ridiculous bad
Is there gunk coming out of your right nose? Can&#39;t focus on the vid....getting distracted. lol
I hope they do more with the Soli radar chip, because from what I saw in the research for it there are sooooo many cool things it can do (really interesting gestural inputs, to the degree of accuracy where at a British uni they could sense what liquid was being poured into a beaker with it), so I&#39;m disappointed with how limited their vision is with it currently.
I think the swipe may not be working because you have the camera lens pretty close to the detector as well while you wave your hand over it? Just guessing.
What happen bro so much negative 👎 comment on all features 🤔are u paid by apple😜
meh, am I the only one who thinks this phone is lame and overpriced?
camera comparison between pixel 4 and the 1+7 pls
What music Player is he using?
Sad.. not good looking and over priced
After what OnePlus 7T is offering for lower price this phone sounds like a total bust.
Pixel 4 only thing is good about this phone is camera other than that this phone is completely BShit
This phone would be worth it at the price of the Pixel 3a. Not at this flagship price.
Easily worst phone of 2019🤘😁😎
Once more android stole  iPhone camera design like always
Once more android stole  iPhone camera design like always
Once more android stole  iPhone camera design like always
That radar is a gamble that will not pay off for Google. <br>Screen-to-body ratio is more important to most people.
I want to see battery life compared to iPhone 11 pro max and screens with audio and video comparisons please and thanks 😊
The color and back design reminds me of nokia lumia back in the days like the lumia 830.
See kids, this is what you get when you purchase the iPhone 11 pro on Wish
Cut off the front camera on note 10+. Trust me.
Almost half the battery of other phones? Why?
Aaaactually, ultra wide Is the easiest mode to fake with software. It&#39;s called panorama mode...
Should I switch to the pixel 4xl from a note 9
his BOOGER is very distracting.
They effed up. The design looks 4 years old. That forehead...😂
Yessss, someone used Disarm as an intro
Is google drunk? I&#39;m getting emotional
What’s sad is that the telephoto is only a 2x and the iPhone pro is a 10x. A no brainier if your a camera buff! If I were to come back to Android it certainly wouldn’t be a Pixel 4. Maybe a S10+ or a Note 10.
<b>Maybe the radar sensor has narrower angle and slower speed, and your hand is too big so it already covering the whole sensor and because of slower and narrower sensor it couldn&#39;t sense you were hovering</b> <i>Try to use the edge of your hand a little bit tilted closer to the perpendicular to the sensor, instead of flat palm facing to the sensor,  and hover slower</i>
<i>MKBHD</i> : <i>Stop being racist and discriminating me google, give me</i> <b>MY MATT FINISH, NOW</b> ! 😤
haha good luck selling this for 800 bucks google
Why google is always copying  iphone .google pixel 3 notch ,4 camera
As a Verizon customer, I&#39;d have to pay almost $12 more a month for the iPhone 11PRO so seeing this as a minor let down compared to the Apple isn&#39;t so bad for me. Maybe some updates will come into play? However, if this cost me $40 a month through Verizon, THEN I&#39;d say this is a HUGE let down.
The black version is ideal (more discreet).  Unless you are a cheerful and bouncy young man.
I got to see Pixel 4 at Best Buy. The bezel didn&#39;t bother me one bit. I was impressed.
I&#39;d rather have thin bezels that a notch sticking out.
Pixels have always been duds. Every single one has had a whole host of deal breakers.
Remember how module phones existed so Google bought them and then just destroyed the project
little display in a big phone !! failed !!!
I see no reason why anyone would pick this over the 7T. I work in wireless and this is the biggest bust I&#39;ve seen in a long time.
Mark ass brownie
Battery life is my main concern. I have the pixel 2 and my battery is starting to drain fast.
FYI...Even iPhone has radar too! 😅
Please Tell us if it&#39;s worth buying....
It looks like a toy iPhone
Privacy gone, again.
Seems like Google is confused.
I like how he never mention about the square camera looks exactly the same as the leaked iPhone 11.
No Headphone jack.. and wide angle lens.. BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Orang
I&#39;ll just stick with my pixel 2 for now, still digging it
Didn’t Samsung had that swipe gimmick with the galaxy s4?
My LG G6 want to know about your wide angle camera.
Glad I got the note 10 plus
Pixel Trash.  😂
When does the embargo lift for the full review?
No more infinite pics storage
Hot take (from someone that&#39;s never had a telephoto or wide angle camera): give me telephoto over wide angle!
I don’t get the swipe feature. You added a radar just want to get two inches away from your phone?
Marques @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=579">9:39</a>: lemme know if you have any concerns,camera,battery life<br><br><br><br><br>Also Marques @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=587">9:47</a>: but no matter what you do,just make sure you subscribe
Damn the camera going crazy every pixel launch
2800 mah battery?? Worst phone for 2019 yet!
It definitely misses the mark for me
This is a letdown
Shittiest phone of 2019.
That swiping gesture was also a feature on samsung galaxy s4
2 months later...… Google Pixel 5!!!!! Coming soon!!! waste of our planets resources. a phone that lasts a few months before its outdated!? Wow that sounds like such a good idea to buy one!!!!! Lets go blow $1500!!!!!!!!!!! People dying of starvation have no homes.... yep lets put all our effort into useless fuckin cellphones that give u cancer/brain tumors and have mass amounts of radiation being produced from them.
waste of resources/money. grab a brain people. shit like this is meant to keep you distracted from the real truth of what is going on in our world
rip battery
Where all the people shitting on iPhone 11 pro at 😂 BrO eNjOy BeFoR tHe PiXeL 4 DeStrOyS ApPlE. Just buy the phone you like ffs
Yikes. It&#39;s as if they wanted to make the phone as unappealing as possible. Face unlock only? Great. So I&#39;d be typing in my pin all the time, because mostly I just want to glance at the phone which is on my desk. Without drawing all that much attention. Just see if there&#39;s anything important and be done with it. Having to hover over it? Nah.<br><br>No headphone jack... I&#39;m still not a fan. I can live without, but I don&#39;t want to.<br><br>And then that camera. Having had the P30 Pro for a few months I&#39;d say the ultra wide gets more use. But the 5x zoom is fun too. But that&#39;s 5x. For 2x all you need is a bit of software and a high res sensor. Having a second camera which will probably take worse photos than just cropping down the main camera? Pointless. Absolutely pointless. I&#39;d much rather have the Pixel 3...
Does pixel 4 still comes with unlimited storage on Google photos at original resolutions?
Google: We&#39;re better.<br>Apple: Really?<br>Apple(2019): Launches iPhone11 pro.<br>Google(2019): Copies iPhone11 pro.
Waiting for Pixel 5 leaks to start happening
Great review as always.  Loved the pixel 2.  Did not buy the 3 in part bc of the eyesore notch.  Def will not be picking up the 4.  Pixel is devolving and now serially underwhelming.   What&#39;s next, Pixel BB storm?? Keep it!  Currently using OnePlus 7 (not 7 pro) and love most everything except camera..which I admit is the weakest link...but what do you expect for $500?
No p2!!! :(
2 things keeping me from buying this phone.  Back looks like an iPhone &amp; where&#39;s the fingerprint scanner.
One of the most underwhelming new phones I think they talked to apple
Marques u got a big ass booger in ur nose bruh.. nobody was gon tell u bruh! Be easy .. and the google pixel 4 look like a knockoff iPhone 11 pro max
Phone with forehead in 2019 ,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 it looks like it has case in it already. <br>When everyone is going beezelless ,but google designed a phone with dated design, those designers in google r&amp;d🤮🤬😠
Who the heck is needed for ultrawide camera? I&#39;m still using one camera phone and that&#39;s exactly what I need.<br>And one more thing to say. In my mind, this normal-sized (I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s big) forehead looks way better than that ugly iPhonish display notch or any other cutout.<br>IMHO
Iphone 11 release: Ugh thats ugly <br><br>Pixel 4 release: oh that looks nice i love it<br><br><br><br><br>You iphone haters
Fake iphone11
Should I rather buy the oneplus 7t (ugly cricular camera...) or the 7 pro (2 months old, but new condition) if they are both the same price?
I don&#39;t care about ultra wide. It&#39;s not even accurate on most smart phones.
This video looks amazing on my note 10+.
Will stick with my pixel 3.
It starts at 64GB, which is a little soft.、、科学上网V2ray/SSR翻墙机场梯子VPN来了，强力抗封，支持安卓、IOS、MAC、WIN等设备，超低14.9元/月100G流量，4K秒开，不限速，线路任选，免费体验网址：xindongli点top

Samsung: Let’s add 3 cameras<br><br>Apple: How bout we do the same. Totally not copying...<br><br>Google before: Nah, we’re fine. We don’t need no 3 cameras. 1 is enough<br><br>Google one month later: Boi we need them 3 cameras with lenses. We’re failin’ hella hard
The camera unit at the back looks like the early leaks of the iPhone 11. Lol
it&#39;s a perfect phone but NOT ULTRA WIDE !!! GOOGLE WHAT ARE YOU DOING ??!
It feels like you are holding the phone upside down with that huge up-at-the-top thing (IDK how they call it). Why?
🤮
iPhone 11 pro has left the chat
OMG the photo sphere mode is SEVERELY UNDERATED marques please mention it in the review people need to know it exists
Nothing life changing here
Awesome phone!!!
One more thing: they don&#39;t give you unlimited Google Photos storage in original quality anymore. Only HQ. That&#39;s really frustrating.
honestly this badest design phone ever for google pixel.
hit like if u think the Gestures on Samsung Galaxy S4  is better than this
So its not very impressive at all. Thanks google, now we only have samsung to rely on for meaningful upgrades.
Me: Oh my god, this is such a great phone, I need this!<br><br>Price: £769<br><br><b>Slowly backs out of room</b>
Literally everyone: Eeeewww new iPhone&#39;s camera is so ugly<br>Google: Hold my beer!
no headphone jack?
Copied iphone
You guys would be screaming if a new iphone would look like that , thats how much bias you put in your videos , if a iphone would have these cameras and bezels omg the iphone would be such a step back in all the competition is so much better but when its a google or android phone is perfectly fine . Marques this thing is utter crap in design and features , the pixel 3 impressed me way more than this did and my XS unlocks just as fast as this ... so no points for the face id fake and the copied design
Mattteee Brolwnleee...
nah,iphone 11 better,and cheaper XD<br>what a plot twist
panda panda panda
You should really review more chinese phones like oppo vivo...they are much better than pixl..the googles engineers are so lazy they dont even listen to thier coustomers
is this going to be one those google dick riding videos, again?
Nice LG phone.
I disagree with you almost completely mainly because other brands, especially apple, have been making the same phone every single year with little to no changed for years now, and yet somehow this is supposed to be more of a letdown?
Would love to hear about the 50mm camera focal length. &amp; the incoming call features.
All I care about is if the camera, video quality amazing ?.  I&#39;m gutted about the unlimited photo storage but I feel like Google might bring it back.
it looks like it already have a body cover! 😂
What&#39;s in your right nostril? Can&#39;t take my eyes off it
I can see your disappointment from miles :)))) but i like it though that you are very balanced in your reviews . First impulse should be to destroy this phone, but you are always looking at the good and the bad stuff . That is maturity right there. Good job!
As a Pixel 3xl owner, I have to think twice if I get the pixel 4. <br>1. The XL model in orange is not available in Germany. (Why?)<br>2. No front speakers.<br>3. No unlimited storage of pictures taken with the pixel.<br>4. 899€ here in Germany for the XL-version<br>5. Except the 90hz display no feature that would be worth it to change. (The radar gesture thing is, well... Nice but not really a must-have.) The Astro fotography thing will also be released on pixel 3 I guess... <br><br>So... Actually, there&#39;s no need to get the Pixel 4... Besides of liking the design of the phone...
I&#39;ve been really looking forward to the Pixel 4. I dont know a lot besides some of the specs. I want to know why someone would buy it over some of its competitors like Samsung. I have been an android consumer since the Note 4. I got the S7, and currently use the S8 Plus. I have wanted a Pixel since the 2nd one, but only now can I since they are available to all major providers. Just wondering how does it compare to a S10 plus, or Note 10 Plus? If anyone could explain a little I would greatly appreciate. I&#39;m looking at new phones in November after my plan changes.
I don&#39;t see what all the fuzz is about. I like the phone.
So it ripped off the camera square from Huawei just like Apple did. Americans and their shitty phones. 😂 🤷‍♂️
I can see something coming out of his right nostril.
Anyone else noticed the tiny booger? Once seen cannot be unseen. No pun intended, just funny, we&#39;re all human. :D
Bruh it’s just a copy of iPhone 11.
Is the pixel 4&#39;s 2800 mAh sufficient to handle the 90Hz display with OLED FHD and QHD combined with Snapdragon 855 for the whole all day?
I own a Pixel 3 XL and that&#39;s more than enough for me in 2019 and hopefully till the end of 2020. Great camera, good display, and tons of features that just standout from other phones (Android and Apple). I don&#39;t mind the big notch that everyone is/were concerned or mocking it for. <br><br>+Front firing speakers<br>+Flat display<br>+Camera features<br>+Now playing song recognition<br>+First to get software updates<br>+Unlimited google cloud storage for photos<br>+Stock Android<br><br>That being said I also agree that google can do so much more easily and sooner for their old and new products. <br><br>I was contemplating between Note9 and Pixel 3XL and I am very glad I chose the latter, not that Note9 is bad but I realized that I may not use or need all the features that Note9 has and plus let&#39;s not forget the UI .
who cares bro its just a colour
Good mid range phone.. wait!! As per Google it&#39;s not mid range 🤔
Pixel 1: &quot;Headphone Jack, Satisfyingly, not new&quot;<br>Pixel 2: no headphone ja<br>ck and at the same time we released wireless earphones<br><br>Pixel 3: &quot;We only need one camera and don&#39;t need zoom as we have software&quot;<br>Pixel 4: Telephoto zoom is important so we added that.<br><br>Pixel 4: &quot;Wide angle is less important&quot;<br>Pixel 5: ? Take your best guess what they&#39;ll add
Square camera bump is the new trend now.
This is the worst Google made phone I have seen in a long long time
Mat on the back
What a let down. I really feel my OnePlus 7 pro is a better deal right now.
Swipe shit like the galaxy s4 and they sell this shit for new lol<br>Fuck this garbage for that price.
It just copier of iPhone 11 thats all
Thanks Marques. No ultra wide angle camera, no matte black,...it sucks. Skip.
I think the smaller pixel 4 battery is not enough to handle 90hz display 🤣
Booger sticking out of his nose @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=105">1:45</a>
Google quality as usual. 👎
Does pixel 4 works in India?
I’m not gonna lie ...<br><br><br><br>I like the camera design better then the 11 pro
That&#39;s the worst phone I&#39;ve seen this year. Very cheap looking, ugly and traditional.<br><br>At that price only a fool would get it.
Go buy the $699 i11.  It’s the best hand device in 6 years.  Apple decided for the first time ever to give you the pinnacle for cheap.  The i11 is the really best thing on the market right now. I’ll admit, Apple as been ripping people off since the the i7, but the their new gig really is the best phone right now. <br><br>It truly is the best tech in your hand overall for less than $800
One more reason shouldn’t buy pixel4 is they remove the benefit of free uploading photos and videos as original quality from it. Yes the phone is so ugly
I don’t really know how gestures can be use in a phone...like you literally got to get close to the phone, why don’t you just skip the song the hand?
no one:<br>google: lets remove the fingerprint sensor and add some gimmick features the s4 had in 2013
Another thing missing is no 4K 60FPS recording support. Pixel 4 can record videos at only 4K 30fps.
Its a BORING Phone
If there&#39;s no fingerprint sensor, do your apps work with your face too? Most financial and several other apps let you sign in with your fingerprint. How does that work on the Pixel 4?
the amount of times hes been hitting the woah at the end is killing me
Had Apple introduced this phone with last gen specs, buggy software gestures, dual-cameras, removed the fingerprint scanner, a huge forehead, and no new innovative features, the internet would have been shitting itself and every reviewer would have been in uproar.  With the Pixel, it&#39;s just ughhh...okay.
that billie eillish cover  will give me nightmares tho
I was thinking about getting the pixel xl but now I&#39;m not so sure, thank you for all your impressions.  I think I&#39;m going to stick with my galaxy s9+
What does the 3rd sensor in the camera module do????
Google you’re almost there and you blew it off! 😔
Also im not big on gestures. Its a touch screen. Im holding my phone 90% of the time. Its just as easy to touch the screen as it would be to wave my hand a certain way. I feel like this has been the most underwhelming pixel yet, just from what i saw. Every year it seems they have gaps and it leaves us saying why? Pack every feature in that you can and make me want to pay $799....
The first pixel that should be awesome, but i don&#39;t want it. I had pixel xl, loved it. 2 xl, love it. And was going to get a 4.... But no fingerprint? I mean, maybe its not needed for everyone. But if you charge $800, don&#39;t remove things. I want my fingerprint scanner. Im not interested in face id. Camera is cool, i agree, why not add the third one? Stop trying to act too cool and say we don&#39;t need that. Just like removing the headphone jack... Come on. Just keep it. More people want it than not. As a backup. I will go with a 3 and if the 5 is not right, i will be going back to samsung
Big smartphone players are become lazy and arrogant in the market after every launch of their new smartphone
I like this one. classic and ergonomical.
phones are taking a huge dump the last 4 or 5 years.
That intro gives me nostalgia
Didnt samsung do something similar with air gestures
Yours is very likely the best review channel I&#39;ve encountered. I love your videos and your clear and interesting facts about these products. Thank you so much for your work! ❤️
I want to see this in the sun , the pixel 2 screen sucked outside
Hmm..seems like my Samsung Galaxy S9+ already does everything minus the interchangeable telephoto, and gimic star map ... :(
Apple knockoff
So my iPhone was working fine until I did the new iOS 13 updated, now my audio doesn’t work. This happened to me a couple years ago, anyways.  I went to the Apple store and they said the “audio chip is not working” and I told them it was working this week 10-18-19. Apple is making more money, screwing with peoples iPhones so they can updated or get a new one. Now, I’m switching to Samsung Android just for that. Not fair!
I don&#39;t see any rational reason to purchase this phone over the s10.
I don&#39;t think they improved the video much, but did they? I&#39;m curious if it&#39;s at least 60fps or how great it can look compared to iPhone 11.
Fuck i can clearly see google following the path of apple😂
Damn that&#39;s ugly as hell
Design 😥lol
Does it not have wide angle? I read they don&#39;t have ultra wide  just a wide angle one. Heres the link @t. If it doesn&#39;t have that going to cancel my preorder.
Why these feature less phones gotta be $900
ya’ll samsung users gon talkshit when apple imitates samsung shit, but when Samsung does, u gon shut up.
honestly, it looks like someone tried to sell the iphone 11 but it was a scam.
Marcus bruv why you wasting our time with an impression video. You have the phone just put all your thoughts in the full review ...
Dear Google,<br><br>Not interested in $800 and $900 phones.  Also not interested in watered down &quot;a&quot; models.  Give me a phone with the latest chip and sell it for $600.  If you need an example of what I mean, look no further than the OnePlus 7t.  Do this and you will earn my business.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>A former Nexus owner turned OnePlus owner.
One plus 7pro best phone of 2019
So it’s an iPhone.... with one less camera. <br><br>Cool
Attacked. Google wasn’t even thinking about a random kid on YouTube while developing this phone. They don’t care about you. Lol
Man, idk why but that camera module looks better than the iphone 11
50IQ google decision making
Going to wait for the Pixel 5.<br>No wide angle lens and no 5G or storage capacity increase from the 3 was a bit disappointing...
Your camera was too close to make the radar work as it should have
Waow 2800mah, i think it will last for 1 week :))
Face recognition in the dark?
telephoto is totally better guys, accept
Starts at 64GB, not 128GB
Never heard of any of the music you&#39;re listening to.. I must be old
When will the full review drop ? I&#39;m considering on buying it but don&#39;t want to rush into it till I watch your full review
YOU ROOK THIS FROM APPLE YOU BITCH
Love your vids Marques. You know you saw that nose thing when you edited and uploaded this vid. Good for you not caring.
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Guess I will still keep my Note 9
What&#39;s the battery life like?
I m just scrolling comments to find the link of the blue wallpaper. Sad i can&#39;t find it. Please leave link ..
i actually prefer the telephoto over the ultrawide
Bought the Oneplus 7 Pro the same day as the official announcement. Couldn&#39;t be happier with it and really glad I didn&#39;t get the Pixel 4!
The camera is going to be the best in class for sure, esp that front camera as the pixel 3a’s selfie cam even blew me away. However I can’t accept the fatal flaw of a phone someone can unlock by holding it to your face when you are asleep. Like what the hell google?? The only real saving grace of the Pixel 4 is camera. Everything else is lame.
&quot;So...I dont know I feel slided&quot; 😂😂 so funny but so great lol
Notch is the gayest thing a smartphone can have
I don&#39;t know what are you doing with the sound, but keep it up. Sounds like honey for my ears &lt;3.
i just want the pokemon live wallpaper
No ultra wide angle … no Pixel 4 for me!
Am I the only one that remembers having hand gesture like 5 years ago on the Note 3?! I remember being fascinated by it cos it worked so well! Way better than what this Pixel can do lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=358">5:58</a> Galaxy s 4 Am i a joke to you ?!
Not saying google is right, but now I&#39;m thinking about the ultrawide camera. As a photographer, on my Galaxy S10+, I loved the ultrawide camera and took many shots during the first week of buying the phone. But today if I look back into my gallery not a single ultrawide in 2 months.<br>I think we mostly shoot selfies, portraits and people on smartphones, not so much architecture or scenery. I wouldn&#39;t just take a smartphone on vacation to take pictures, camera is must. Ultrawide doesn&#39;t fit well for regular phone phone photography, just like fisheye lens (it&#39;s fun- but not much useful).
I really hate to say it, but this phone looks like the ugly brother of the iphone 11, hardware and software 🙄
И чем картинка пизже чем у ай как просто сука?
the one thing I am looking forward to the most about the pixel 4 is the pixel 3 lowering its prize so I can finally buy it
I know you know that you have a booger, but great video... as usual.
2019 and I can&#39;t find a flagship phone with an LED notification light.
just disappointing .pixel 4 lacks a lot of features.
No finger print scanner?<br>How you meant to unlock your phone if it&#39;s dark<br>Or even use apps that require fingerprint like banking apps<br>I&#39;m going to pass on this one
Getting the note 9 last year was the best decision I have ever made. Wow these new phone have been disappointing
Please make a battery review for the small pixel 4, I actually wanna see what 2800 mAh can do in 2019
video quality (sound included) at concerts would be nice to know about. maybe even compare it with the new iPhones, as they have been leading concert/festival recording quality for years now :)
I think I see a booger
Rip pixel
I feel like you out there who care about what the back of your phone looks and feels like live life on the edge :P. Mine will have a case on it.
How the I phone 11 should of looked like
Telephoto? I missed that... YEAH! It&#39;s the single one reason why i don&#39;t upgrade my iPhone 8P to the iPhone 11. The telephoto is so much more useful for me. This could be the reason to go back to android.
Samsung Make Flat Screens!
The screen on the pixel looks ugly as always
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=204">3:24</a> lmao the ad for the pixel 3a and iphone x
Google in Pixel 2: we have headphone jack! <br><br>Google next year takes it off.<br><br>Google in pixel 3: we don&#39;t need 2 cameras to do portraits!<br><br>Google next year: adds telephoto camera 🤦‍♂️<br><br>Tbh this makes them look stupid.
Will the pixel 4 be releasing in India?
Great, google can now sense your movements even when you’re away from you’re phone with radar
Have you tried having a white guy test the soli radar? Maybe the tech is racist like those viewfinders of the past
Google: This phone will unlock as you reach towards it before you even hit power button.<br><br>MB: But Black color is glossy. What a shitty phone.
Can we now officially say that OnePlus does Android better than Google themselves?
Better than the iPhone 11. Not better than 11 Pro.
Nosehair!
its like iPhone 11
I really wished they made a Not Purple  color like the Pixel 3a
Maybe a pro is on the way
Google should go back to making $300 nexus
God, Google if you really want to copy Apple so much why didn&#39;t you wait till the feature is fully there and then refine it. An example would  be wait till someone can make a fully bezel less screen and then put your front facing speakers. You didn&#39;t have to take away both the front facing speaker and fingerprint reader. Apples main thing is just refine something that&#39;s been out for years.
Why is it that none of the reviews i see don’t note how this phone is a iPhone copy in looks. Sounds like a little paid bias’s going on from these big phone reviewers. Same old
Thank you for your review!<br>Kindly test pixel 4 battery life on day to day routine.
why is he hating on this phone though? its like everything that&#39;s slightly off triggers him. I still liked the review though
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=418">6:58</a> I&#39;m sat here slightly amazed at the idea and creativity of this shot leading into specs. So simple! And brilliant.
Why is this trynna copy an iphone🤦‍♂️
This phone ain&#39;t it. I&#39;ll get the s11 if it has a headphone Jack. If not, s10plus
3.5k dislikes.. you idiots should rate marque&#39;s video, not that you dislike the pixel 4 phone...
Pixel 4 is a scam
so much milly rocking in this video with the swiping
I need Ultra wide<br>Waiting for the &#39;pro&#39; or &#39;T&#39; version of this beast❤
4k booger :(
Test the video quality, please. I know 2019 is the year of photos, but video are interesting too!
The panda one😂😂😂
Booger in the nose. Right from the beginning
Nice Google cell phone, the design is a little bit boring and it is missing the wide angle camera and sd card slot.
When it will lanch in India?...
Do you buy phones in order to review them!??
I can&#39;t believe there is no matte black
I like the finish but that forehead bezel, what are they thinking!?
This phone is shite for the price and lack of features
Thanks Google for removing my finger print scanner, and not adding an ultra-wide camera. Perfect, that&#39;s exactly what I wanted.
Isn&#39;t the primary camera of the P3 and P4 a wide angle lens? Because I have a P3, and the (only) primary camera is wide angle. I can see that because there is a fish eye effect with the camera (that effect is fixed in software). Telelens therefore makes the whole picture complete.
This is ugly so is the iPhone!
y&#39;all are wildn&#39;
im getting the pixel 40
MKBHD: I feel personally  attacked!!!<br><br><br>Google: Uhm ,Do you also want to feel personally demonetized???
Wallpaper in the review  video
Android 10. Would love to know how that is working out.
Worth mentioning:<br><br>- The Pixel lineup will have first-dibs on Stadia.<br>- Once they&#39;ve refined Soli, it will almost certainly open up unprecedented controller-free AR/VR interactions that you can&#39;t get on any other device.<br><br>I am disappointed that they didn&#39;t go with the 855+, but I&#39;m really excited for the 90hz display and a long-awaited RAM boost. I do also wish they had incorporated both wide and tele lenses, though if I had to pick one I think I will use the zoom more often.<br><br>Can&#39;t decide if I love or hate the orange...
In other words the iPhone 11 pro max is a better phone?
This is why I&#39;m sticking with Samsung Galaxy phones. These other phone makers are either adding crazy/useless features or leaving certain features out
thx
Pixel 4 launch was like your surprise birthday party that you already knew about.
phone is trash, software is excellent
Soooo... it&#39;s shit... good. OnePlus is just way better.
Lol, why does google do this they should know what we want but they give us this shit? Like wtf?<br><br>Edit: On the other hand it&#39;s good for OnePlus.
Is this worth switching from a pixel 3 to the pixel 4?
I like to have a headphone jack. Went back to wired earpods after 2 years of using Bluetooth ears. I need a headphone jack!
Nice USA U Jersey
Please give me a phone
Suivez ma chaîne s&#39;il vous plait
😂🤣*BATHTUB NOTCH*
Small battery, missing wide angel camera and missing fingerprint reader is killing it for me. A lot of my apps use fingerprint to unlock for example banking... they mostly dont support face unlock.
Google Pixel 4 Face Unlock Works Even If Your Eyes Are Closed👀<br><br>Google Pixel 4 is fresh out of the oven with dedicated hardware for face unlock, something Google claims is a fast and accurate method of authentication with a motion detection feature added for convenience. But it appears that face unlock protocol on the Pixel 4 has a major flaw, as it can unlock the phone even if users are not looking at it or their eyes are closed. This security scare is not just a bug that early Pixel 4 users have discovered. Instead, Google itself has warned users that their Pixel 4 can be unlocked even when their eyes are closed or if someone holds it in their face without them knowing.<br><br>The Pixel 4&#39;s thick top bezel houses dual face unlock IR cameras, flood illuminator, dot projector, a front-facing camera, and the Soli radar chip – all of which work in tandem to recognise facial data for authentication. But the purpose of having such hardware comes into question when it can unlock the phone even if the eyes are closed. The most obvious misuse scenario is that someone else can hold the Pixel 4 in front of the owners&#39; face while they are sleeping and unlock the phone, leading to catastrophes such as data theft or even rob them via banking apps secured by the face unlock protocol.
Aah, no headphone port.
Basically there is no reason to buy this phone.
Pixelbook Go???
how the iphone back shouldve looked imo
When you can’t afford an iPhone 11
I´m the only one that can´t stop looking at the hair nose ?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=395">6:35</a> &quot;90hz display&quot; Marques is starting to sound like TotalBiscuit, but for phones. ;)
Huawei : we dont make ugly phones<br>Google and Apple : exists ☹️
Pixel 4 makes even iphone look beautiful. Smh
Il stick to my Nexus 6p running Android 10 (pixelexperience)
mark ass brownie
new iphone leader in the market......confirmed!
Just another meh...phone 😆 just like iPhone etc...
MKBHD &quot;...so this arnge one here...&quot;
The things Google should do/include to actually sell their phones are SO OBVIOUS. Why are they so freaking stubborn every year and refuse to do them, they’re so stingy with everything on their phones it makes them a hard sell when the competition is so fierce
The Pixel is officially dead. What a joke of a phone.
This phone is a miss. Hardware still matters
Man that bat in the cave was annoying me the whole video.
128GB max. That blows. I still use this Pixel 2 XL and I&#39;m happy. If Pixel 5 is insane in terms of an upgrade, I might finally upgrade. Really disappointed with this one.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=296">4:56</a> Sounds like the women I know 😉
For the price... just no
well, not that it&#39;s new.... google never fails to disappoint , they&#39;ve had gaps in the past.... and the telephoto is more important thing had me laughing ...
Is 6gb of RAM enough on the pixel 4?
Yikes pixel executives are gonna get in trouble for this shitty launch. Nobody likes this phone lol
is it me or the google phone is copying the iphone ideas and the camera
Pixel 4 XL or Note 10+?
Where can I find this tshirt?
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=405">6:45</a> when i saw pattern dots , i remembered my childhood , lol
Is this worth upgrading to from Pixel 3
Such big bezzels are a proof that you cant be good at everything. Stick to your  area of expertise.
I think google have one thing right and that is a never use my fingerprint unlock
Can anyone else notice booger on his right nostril ? :p
iphone 11 FTW  this thing is garbage !
I still think the 2xl looks the best
I wanna know how the radar works?
Personally I like it, and the bezels are still an upgrade from my 1st gen pixels
Get closer.. Get on top...
The booger hanging out his noes is annoying me
Why are they so stingy on storage? With all the media people consume nowadays, 256 should be the default with 512 always an option.
Look at that Markass booger
when are you dropping your 4 moth review?? tomorrow?
ئئئسييييسيي
What is the point of upgrading from Pixel 2 to Pixel 4?<br>I just downloaded Google Recorder, live backgrounds from Pixel 4, upgraded my camera as well.... The only difference is the refresh rate... And radar that apparently doesn&#39;t work that well.<br><br>I don&#39;t get it.... But maybe it&#39;s only me? 🙄
why would someone buy this (pixel 4) ugly looking phone? or the iphone 11? when there are so many other cheaper, better, and good looking smartphones out there on the market..
I hace the Google pixel 2xl right now, and scrolling slowed over time and got worse with updates until the most recent. Now it feels much smoother and faster. Can you speak to what you notice about speed over time with the 4s?
Lord willin&#39; - Logic
iPhone Xs, never been happier with a phone.
This, or 2 max redmi k20 pro premiums with 12+512 and snapdragon 855+
Didn&#39;t reach my expectations, but still I might consider/exchange for Galaxy S9+..<br>Pro&#39;s<br><br>Still loved the &#39;smooth&#39; 90Hz display<br>The Motion Sense radar-based gestures<br><br><br>Con&#39;s<br>Less battery capacity<br>The amount of basic storage
I hate the fact that year after year google just trying to make pixel the android version of iphone.
<b>Google is copying apple confirmed</b>
Did Apple engineers start working at Google?
Still blows me a way that a company that owns Soooooo much information can not get a phone right...this should be the best in the business, they should know through shear data analytics alone what people want. <br><br>But hey what do I know, small 2x zoom instead of wide angle, a radar feature no body will ever use, no head phone jack and small batteries could turn it into a big seller....
I bet if you had your way, you would mat black everything around you

is no one gonna talk about how they copied the iphone11
I once owned lumia 830 orange color<br>I swear it looks same as that.
Camera test please because if that&#39;s still decent then there&#39;s a little hope. Video test as well
Disappointed 😗😙marques😅😅
google spying on huawei, like the Camera design
Why does Google make phones?
Why he is not criticising the boxy camera? He was doing it against apple? Did he just got paid not to mention “copying apple “?
Oh my god! Don&#39;t copy Apple`s copy from Huawei! Evil appearance!!!

Voice Memos Guy: I&#39;m Super into this!!!
Pixel four worse mobile for 2019 i guess
Is it worth the upgrade from pixel 3
No finger sensor is a deal breaker for me. No thanks to the facial recognition bs.
All these iPhone and Samsung Galaxy haters trying to degrade the pixel 4! 😂
Let&#39;s see what the new samsung will bring next year. Apple looking good to me now. Cheaper and camera is better
If apple would of did the same thing to the camera like they did the google phone iPhones would be the main topic rn 👌🏽🙃
Shoot RAW on OnePlus - and that&#39;s your best Android Experience.<br>C&#39;mon it&#39;s Android! - Lightroom, Snapseed, VSCO, Polar etc<br><br>UFS 2.0, Same Image Sensor, Snapdragon 855 available before the Galaxy S10, 6000-series aluminium.. It&#39;s just a mass Surveillance tool directly under Google for them. Idiots fanboyism over markup Pixel.<br><br>Everything about the Pixel has nothing to do anywhere with hardware, only Software - more specifically» Computational Photography for JPG. Shoot RAW with better Image Sensors out there.
Hi , would like to see a review on the scripting ability of this phone. It was mentioned at the Google event. About it manuscripting and recording speech. I feel this could be an overlooked feature. If it works well this could be amazing especially for work. I write case notes whilst out and about which can be problematic. If you could just dictate and the phone wrote it down...how cool<br>Please review this feature.<br>Thank you.
Check Ur nose dude !
This feels very much like a beta tester device. Google is even offering heavy incentive to buy early ($100 gift card to play store). I think they have more software sided features that haven&#39;t baked enough to be released alongside the phone. It&#39;ll be interesting to see a post-launch review 6 months from now.
So this is the iPhone 11 with Google UI 👌🏼 I didn’t even have to watch the video 😁
Just a disappointment, if I had to spend so much money on the phone I would choose the iPhone 11. large corporations introduce gesture control function that will be just as necessary as a notch on the screen. Meanwhile, Chinese phones are offering more and more for half this amount
Conclusion: Don&#39;t buy this gen of Pixel
I don’t understand why google doesn’t make the best android phone .... I want a pixel but the features suck.... just add all the fucking cameras it’s almost 2020, why not future proof your customers ,... and I’ll be an idiot not to future proof myself
But then hey i felt Google is quite clever in opting for SD 855 than 855+ as it Pixel 4 isn&#39;t a gaming device. Also, just for 87 Mhz increase, why at all should a tech Co. shell out its bucks to the product chips processing OEMs 🙄
will pixel 4a come to India???
I really want to know how the battery on the small version is, battery life is important for me
i don&#39;t like pixel 3 and 4. 2 bad years and 2 bad event with rick osterloh. really you think google can&#39;t understand what we want?! they know everything about us,everything!!!<br>google you most bring back Hugo Barra and launch again project NEXUS.
Place this against the OnePlus 7T, hard sell imo.
Google obviously made the black phone glossy as literally everyone hated on the pixel 3 black as it was very easy to scratch.
Please marques, cover assistant part during pixel 4 review.
Pixel 4 has the thinnest top bezel in 2019.
Does google really want to sell their phone 😶😶😒😤
I can only imagine Marques reading through his comments when he sees someone mentioning his booger, then watching his video to see what we talking about.. now that’s a reaction I would see on YouTube.
Clearly still making the nexus, but with apple prices.  The pixel has never come close to an appropriate price strategy.
I&#39;m pretty bummed about there being no finger print scanner
It&#39;s the iPhone 11pro max
Na shukra bhadkhau
look at other markets, too, because of this:<br>Pixel 4: 749€ (64 GB), 849€ (128 GB)<br>iPhone 11: 799€ (64 GB), 849€ (128 GB)
Do you want to talk about wide angle selfie lens missing on the pixel 4? In my pixel 3 I use the wife angle lens all the time..
i thought this was going to be about gapps ;)
something in your nose for the whole vid, sorry didnt get anything of what you were saying..
&quot;I&#39;ve gotta test this for the full review&quot;. What do you mean? You&#39;ve had this phone for about a month now
UPILMU LHO MAS, ILANGI SEK. JIJIK DELOK E
Highly disappointing phone.<br><br><br><br><br>They didn&#39;t even try
How to make a google pixel phone: <br>1. Get an iPhone 11 pro <br>2. Cut out camera<br>3. Paste it on the back and twist it 90 degrees<br>4. Use the same things as the pixel 3
Will this voice memo feature be coming to Pixel 3 XL? Would be nice for recording classes... also does it get saved in the cloud?
I was expecting more from google suks.. guess samsung wins this one.. step back i guess..
Dude sounds so 2019... Cringe man. Idk how they let you review phones for free
Indian users will definetly go for apple 11
Here we go again with iphone design copies
This is the first time I wish he dropped the goddamn phone down the stairs.
i WASSS so ready to upgrade from nexus 6p. buut idkkkk hmm.
I swear man people aren&#39;t satisfied with anything everyone gave so much shit about the notch and now it&#39;s the forehead? Jesus LOL. Y&#39;all have issues. I love/hate my pixel 3 Xl. within a year the charging port has weakened to the point I have to constantly switch my charger in and out just to get a good angle to charge and ontop of that I keep getting this annoying pop up about my Bluetooth not working causing me to turn off my phone entirely as a restart. anyways gonna give this one a try and if this one ain&#39;t good it&#39;s bye bye pixels
The premise I&#39;ve noticed after watching many reviews is the following: 1. Google should have went with wide angle over telephoto. Or have had both.  2. 6gb is an upgrade but with most Android flagships phones having a minimum of 8gb. In 2019 6gb is still a hard sell. 3. 64gb of storage is a no go. 128gb base is a must. Especially if they&#39;re taking away unlimited orginal pictures/video storage. 4. Battery size is ridiculously small.  Touting a 90hz display, 4000-5000mAh  should  be standard. 5. Keep your design consistent. If you&#39;re going to use a matte glass design do so for all variances.  6. And lastly, the price. If Google is going to charge flagship prices. They need to give us flagship specs.
bad
I heard they took out the Group selfie function on the front-facing camera. Can you please verify this on your review video!  No one else is mentioning that.
What a shit phone.... Honestly
Am i the only one who loves Google pixel 4&#39;s design
No ultra wide camera.... This is a sad day 😢
Could you also please test the small pixels 4 battery life?
Night had a booger the whole time 😭😭😭😂
The phone looks like a Cheap poorly made iPhone 11 Leak Clone.
Want to know how the pixel 4 (small one) battery will hold up😬
2019,  the awkward phase for smart phones
What&#39;s the obsession with octa cores and teraflops? There are 2 things about it: first, your phone is running of battery most of the time. More powerful CPU is more hungry more often. Meaning you will need to recharge more often.<br>Second, besides running games, what are you doing on your phone? Setting up VMs?  Running calculations for NASA? But I mean if you&#39;re a gamer, go get a switch and bring it with you it has better games anyway. I would still be using my Pixel XL if it would have more RAM for a more fluent experience.
Turd of a phone, iPhone 11 pro buries it.
The voice memo is dope! That’s great for classes &amp; taking notes
The phone that mkbhd didn’t used for a week🤣🤣🤣
Surprised that the people who had portrait mode down without the use of a telephoto lens opt’d to add a telephoto rather than an ultra wide. If they were going to do dual camera instead for triple camera, normal+ultra wide made the most sense for google.
who even likes ultra wide photos? Isn&#39;t mobile photography also moving towards portrait photos more? Wide angles are such boring pictures from a photography point of view!
They have to stop copying apple
That hand gesture thing was on laptops for a while like 10 years ago. It sucked then too
I&#39;ll just keep my pixel 2
Camera overhead while swiping probably confused it. I&#39;m a case guy, so the color of the phone doesn&#39;t matter at all. If the night sight astrophotography feature is as-advertised, my mind is blown. My only disappointment is the lack of a fingerprint reader, because that&#39;s what I&#39;m used to.
Sounds like apple paid u to talk shit.
Not interested in pixel ... Too much attempt to follow iphone .... Pixel need serious restructuring by Google.
is your hairstyle inspired by pixel 4
Its tactics, pixel 4 will be shit and pixel 5 will seem to blow your minds off
MKBHD is appleist.
If they were making the forehead big then they should have at least made it even and added a bottom firing speaker so that both speakers are front facing then they could&#39;ve marketed it as such and thus have more excuses for the bigger bezels
I don’t know which phone to get should I get 3 or 4
You forgot to mention no more free unlimited original quality photo storage
ultrawide shots is only useful for tech users to show off k
I feel like Pixels are prototypes to test for future features rather than a smartphone that is for consumers to use, except they release it anyway lmao
Design is simple, colors are muted, hardware specs are great but not amazing, lack of wide angle camera is not a deal breaker, screen is killer. It&#39;s a natural next gen phone for Google. Google doesn&#39;t make flashy phones.
As the inbuilt radar operates at 60Hz, will google pixel 4 work in other countries except United States?
Mobile is used for hand operations..Why this need..total bullshit..
Booger! Was watching at his booger all video long.
Arggghhh THATS HOT! 🔥
I love my iPhone XR. Definitely prefer the notch over the huge forehead and Face ID gestures are very intuitive.
Google pixel 3 vs 4. I need a new phone and I&#39;m wondering if I should just save money and get the Pixel 3 or is the 4 worth it??
Ehhh......feels like they want us to skip this.
What a shit ass phone. Thank god it&#39;s not even gonna launch here.
Hi marques can you please review sound. Bluetooth compatibility and ease of access in automobiles. How long does it take to fully charge and how long does the charge last with normal activity use. Is anything water resistant? Ididnt really pay attention if they advertised it. And a drop test pleaseeeee and thank you!
Google is not learning anything new from year to year.
Samsung is the best...
great video as always. can you please make a review video of  the astro as well as night sight of the pixel 4
UTRAWIDEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
Big chin, big forehead, lack of jack, no mentions of wireless charging, no touch ID. No Ultra wide cam. Low battery capacity, no dual facing speakers, over priced. Notice anything? Most of these features are available on pixel 1,2 or 3.
Ugliest flagship phone of the year nominee.
When is apple going to launch new ipad????
in the middle of the video , it felt that MKBHD has suddenly become irrelevant to me, dont see your value add in my life anymore, so good bye
u got a booger
I think we can prove that google copys iphone like how iphone copy’s android
pixel 4 is a total flop.
in terms of information Google probably knows more than anybody in the world. So there must be some reason any options they make. If they think telephoto is more important, that&#39;s probably the data tells them. No argue.
orange pixel is  more eyecathing 😍
Honestly guys. I have this feeling that has been confirmed by the latest Google event. Google is just a troll who wants to say we also have eco system like apple.  And so they started producing products one for one against Apple products. Probably started as one of those elaborate April fools pranks but some of Android fanboys liked the idea so much that Google felt the need to do it. The proof of that the last event looked like it was done by the least professional, lowest paid, least experienced low level employees in the company.
When MKBHD rants on the pixel , you know its bad
Well guess I&#39;m waiting for the pixel 5
This gens pixel is interesting I literally got a first gen Xl yesterday on the cheap used for 100 bucks the 1440p panel are per you said in your 2016 coverage of this device is amazing and so is the camera to this day with the updated gcam mods from xda
Google always wants to copy apple for no reason it’s so obvious yet I’ve seen nobody point it out.
Google - Pixel 4 XL with 64GB  it dose not have 5 g   Processor Speed Info<br>2.84 gigahertz  799.99 it dose not say what the Screen Resolution  Display Type<br>OLED<br>   Pixel 4 Google - Pixel 4 with 64GB Processor Speed Info<br>2.84 gigahertz   $699.99 it dose not have 5 g  Display Type<br> OLED  it dose not say what the Screen Resolution this helping out:)
What I want to know is if all apps can use the facial biometrics instead of the fingerprint scanner. For example: Paypal, LastPass, or my banking app. Or do they have to manually put that functionality in there? Because if so then I won&#39;t even think about getting the Pixel 4.
Ugh air swiping hand over phone? Reminds me of when I owned a Galaxy S5...
Your way of conversation and review is awesome
All that forehead and no headphone jack :-/
Trash. All the hype leading to the reveal and they release this bullshit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=307">5:07</a> I guess you never miss huh
I&#39;m not an Android person, but I really like the way this phone looks! Would get the white phone with the matte black!
When did Android add a the swipe from the left to the right to go back? AND a home bar at  the bottom — both of those features are SUPER iOS-y 🤔
Yeah the Pixel 4 is 100 dollars more but at least they do killer deals around Black Friday unlike 🍎
I would like to know more about the battery life of the 4 and the screen outdoors.....I am so disappointed in Google
anyone not gonna say he has a booger hanging out in 4k?
They straight up copied Apple😂
Usually when any new Apple or Google smartphone is released, people whine about it. Then as time passes, the price goes down and the sales go up. Then as more people pick it up, more praises for it. <br><br>Wash, rinse, repeat. That&#39;s my takeaway for every major smartphone announcement from Apple or Google. The cheaper 3 will only get more love right now as the price goes down. <br><br>In a year, people will whine about the Pixel 5 and start snatching up the cheaper 4.
How do you unlock your phone in the dark ?
They had to do they same stupid camera set up like the iphone ..no originality here
Its a sad excuses for a competitive phone in 2019. This is clearly minimal effort and an attempt at max profit. At best they get all their tech to be flawless and it becomes an alright phone at worst they fail to get the tech figured out and it becomes a garbage fire phone.
I&#39;m trying so hard to pay attention to the content of the video but all I can concentrate on is the booger in Marques&#39;s nose
Review the nokia 7
What the heck is google doing. As an Apple fan I am always envious of wide angle portraits. It’s really awesome to be able to take subjects from Far. So excited when I got it on my Pro max ,Took so many wide angle portraits on my vacation which I couldn’t do before on my iPhone X. <br><br>Why the hell would they remove such a nice feature. They are nuts !!<br><br>I was never actually sold on ultra wide. Throught it’s uselsss but now am using it way more than telephoto camera. If they only decided to put a telephoto camera they could have put one which zooms lot further or something.
Could careless about the camera it&#39;s all about the software for me
No SD card reader, small battery, 64GB, no fingerprint reader, no headphone jack, bigass forehead. I don&#39;t see why I would get that phone. I guess I&#39;ll go with a S10+ then.
Google pixel event happened at a good corner of mkbhd studio he didn’t knew it.
that voice memo update would be amazing for university lectures. Hopefully they add that to other android phones and dont make it pixel exclusive
&quot;From £669 Pixel 4 and from £829 Pixel 4 XL&quot;  Is it some kind of joke? These pricetags for these phones?  (128 GB XL is £929....no comment...)
fuck Google pixel4
Can&#39;t quite put my finger on it but something about that iPhone 11 is off
Apple:  the iPhone has the bigger side bezels<br>Google: LOL
R.I.P. Boomsound
Apple: hey Google, with the money your pixel is worth, I can buy better things.<br><br>Google: hahaha, look who says it.
Id rather have a chin and forehead than a notch, the bezels really dont bug me tbh, the full screen phones feel like a solution to a non problem.
wow i like p4....
Is there other security features on this phone? Like password or a code? I refuse to use face unlock on any device.
Google: ay let me copy<br><br><br><br>iPhone11: alright but make it look different for the teacher won’t know...
Wow the Goole pixel 4 ....im not impressed at all...I would not buy it any time soon.....
Not good phone<br> Worst google
What is the battery life like? That&#39;s my only concern. Test it out and let us know :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=83">1:23</a> Your thumb is a totally different species in itself.
LG did this Hand gesture thing and it didn&#39;t boost their sales at all, why would google try the same thing?<br>Google, give up, please, your smartphones are a disgrace.
Read an article saying that pixel 4 unlocks even if your eyes are closed. Is it true? If yes then it could be a security concern.
Google a shit phone,...
Yeah, I&#39;m not really a fan of the face detection for unlocking my phone. I would go for this if only it had a fingerprint reader. Plus that battery... oof. Hand gestures? Right in front of the phone? Why don&#39;t I just touch the phone instead since I&#39;m so close anyway? It&#39;s still water resistant right?? riiight?????
Great, there goes fingerprint login
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=535">8:55</a> shout out to NoLifeShaq
iPhone 11 pro max better lul
I&#39;ll pass..
I know the lack of SD card support is to be expected in a Google phone (since the Nexus One), but lacking that convenience &amp; expandability is still a deal-breaker to me.
Seriously? The Samsung Galaxy S3 and S4 did exactly the same with gestures 😂😂😂<br><br>Everyone thinks it&#39;s new, but it&#39;s already soooo old tech
atleast they dont have any notches or holes
I wish Google would actually go hard at the smartphone market because they could be dominating but it seems like they choose to stay an unsatisfactory competitor.
Does anyone know what music app is being used at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=335">5:35</a> into this video?
I hate this intro so much
Love the phone, don&#39;t see the big deal with bezels, hate notches and punch hole
How&#39;s the face unlock in the dark?<br>Does it still work instantly?<br>How about the radar sensor in the dark too?
That&#39;s why HTC<br> Lost their markets. Google shall buy one plus instead
Dat booger, tho. 4k at it&#39;s finest.
Not upgrading this year 😆
Fortnite and marques brownlee
Samsung has the same camera ready on their galaxy m30s if you look at that phone only looks way better it’s still looks kind of weird but it looks better and they have three lenses in that square type of camera or Google does not they still have one lens the other ones a telephoto it’s still not a camera it’s just a telephoto lens it just makes your images look more stable for a better image there’s no wide-angle on the pixel 4 like the galaxy m30s has
Gross, light mode.
How does the Pixel 4 XL compare to the iPhone 11 Pro?
Solid review mate
I have one big question, should I switch to Iphone 11? I never had a Iphone I was always on android?
Samsung included over display gestures as far back as the Galaxy S4
People want smart phones to look like pimp my ride cars. It&#39;s a phone chill out lol. They all do amazing jobs for the most part
although... the tele lens probably looks super dope on a moment tele on tele setup
booger!
ووههههه
You annoy me...
All I see is a worste version of the iPhone 11
trim your nose hair bro or blow your nose
wow.....<br><br><br>and not in a good way
No mention of 90 Hz screen?!
Google never took the Pixel 4/4 XL serious (my views)
899 for 128 GB lol Asus is like we can do 500 gb for 899
I feel like you should try swiping with your hand flat, I think it&#39;s been designed to work with a flat hand over the phone
if it&#39;s two cameras why make a square :( ?
Samsung was doing this(air swipe to accept and decline calls, air swipe to move pictures) like 7 years ago... 🤦🏾‍♂️ 🤦🏾‍♂️ 🤦🏾‍♂️
Google is copying from Apple on every phone. Annoying af
I don’t like that forehead
That forehead😔
The forward glide from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=420">7:00</a> up until the wall is so dope!
Who Designs these phones for google, I mean wth is that
So the Samsung Galaxy S10 is still the phone to get.<br><br>Well done Samsung 👌🏾
It&#39;s trash 🤪
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKJ4i7p-o-4&amp;t=213">3:33</a> me too bro.. me too
Pixel is turning into some kind of Internet Explorer.
What type of mic are you using i sounds goob
I actually completely agree with Google.  I would much rather have a telephoto camera and zoom in better than wide angle.
Wasn&#39;t this motion sense thing, or something just like it, in the LG G8 earlier this year?
It’s an iPhone with android, so rubbish software lol
phones these days suck
I genuinely prefer the design of my Pixel 3 XL. I never got the issue with the notch. That huge forehead looks much worse to me.
It sounds like, &quot;We are a phone company now, and here are the phones for the current year!&quot; PERIOD
This phone is not worth its price. You are better off getting a oneplus.
So you keep the head phone jack away and you use R&amp;D money to do that swipey thing? Like seriously who need that feature?
Just get yourself a Red Magic 3s.
Very weak sauce
No fingerprint reader = No buy.
What a disappointment 😒
put more makeup on
does it work without the camera in the way?
it looks like the galaxy s8/9
more about the battery life on the smaller pixel 4 please!
&quot; moon and stars in the photos &quot; I&#39;ve been able to achieve this for ages on my Xperia XZ2 Premium
TMobile had Pixel 3A for $299 and I&#39;m skipping the 4. No wide angle killed it for me. I also don&#39;t like my phone unlocking just because it seems my face.
This is a bullshit android iPhone. I&#39;d rather buy an actual iPhone and that&#39;s never gonna happen
