Ukraine, Russia... at this rate it&#39;s all going to be Russia anyway. They should have just stayed together in the USSR as one big family, instead now the big brother is beating on the smaller one.

please try Stalker: Anomaly, its too good
If i download stalker cop from gog can i still play with mods? And where can I find them?
he didn&#39;t look at the pda once

He&#39;s still √Æn his pijama armor and with his pew pew shooter and he goes to Iron forest. At the start of misery there are mutants every where. You dont use binoculars if you are not on a high rock. You don&#39;t look up, you look 360 around you. And you go straight to Skadovsk, on the pipeline route, unless you like cyka blyat.
you&#39;re wrong. the game is made in Ukraine, and the map you are playing is also in Ukraine (Pripyat).
You idiot game made in Ukraine and pripyat in Ukraine.
stalker game took decades for the making... bruh

Western spy in the zone....

Man, i had a lot of fun watching this, but am saddened bout the fact that you went right for misery.<br><br>Stalker is a series of 3 games, and you should really start by playing the first one shadow of chernobyl, then attempt the second one, drop it because its janky, and then play call of pripyat, and after mastering that, play misery then anomaly.<br><br>Going straight for misery is like it was your first time playing minecraft and you decide to teleport to the end to fistfight the ender dragon, with no items or prior knowledge of the game.<br><br>Pick up shadow of  chernobyl, its a bit of a difficult game, but with the non modded game you get stuff like a minimap, armor that actually protects you, and enemies that dont eat bullets for years on end and then turns around and spit you dead in an instant, but still with this spooky atmosphere that your viewers will love to see you in!

Its not indie))and that places with fire much safer than roads)<br>Game tells about alternative reality, about Chernobyl nuclear accident, when tons of radiation pop up into atmosphere, and radiation creates some mutants, artifact&#39;s, before play something like that, Read a book Arkady and Boris Strugatsky : Roadside picnic, its similar, and get you some understanding whats going on around))<br>P.S.<br>Its not russia simulator, its simulation of Ukrainian nuclear catastrophe, using USSR writers novel about mankind catastrophes and Human greed

how does a youtuber with this standarts come to this mod XDD<br>there&#39;s a basegame and literally hundreds of other mods that are &#39;&#39;easier&#39;&#39; + stalker anomaly which is a standalone game/mod pretty much based on every game in the series and this guy .. i mean the first thing you see in the description is his minecraft playlist.. no wonder he shits his pants... or maybe that&#39;s the point of the videos.. like markeplier and those other dudes who make videos just for the sake to scream the whole time..

If yer gonna start yer Zone adventures with a mod, I recommend any version of Oblivion Lost (especially Oblivion Lost 2010). Really best to play unmodded &#39;Shadow of Chernobyl&#39; first, though.

Why is he so scared of this? Wait is this because I haven‚Äôt installed mods?
its looks like escape from tarkov
When you play CoP/Misery first time:1) Read the gameplay manual(not a big deal but you have to understand there&#39;s almost nothing out there gameplay wise , similar to this)<br>2:) Don&#39;t &quot;check this place out&quot;(or other places) , head straight to Skadovsk haven...<br>3)Once at Skadovsk , don&#39;t pick up any quests yet start reading everything about items , about effects of radiation, hunger,bad food etc... as much as you can<br>4)Buy a shotty and ammo( or find one if you are lucky ,even if it&#39;s busted and jams alot) and start grinding mutants around Skadovsk using highround (rocks etc) don&#39;t head out too far out into the wild...the Zone is a very dynamic place , mutants and all other kind of  scum roam the place, fight each other, die and drop loot, whenever you hear shots fired in the distance pick up the binoculars and scout the whole scene there might be good treasure involved.Loot fuckin everything from corpses and what you don&#39;t need ,sell to the traders at base even it&#39;s a shitty price after a couple of hours you&#39;ll see money piling up.Usually keep a 5&#39;45 rifle at first  because that&#39;s the most common caliber for assault rifles, don&#39;t even think about repairing it or improving it, when it&#39;s almost busted ,replace it with other weapon of the same type.<br>5) Usefull tip :when grinding mutants in the first hours check the gas station from time to time as mercenaries , bandits tend to camp there , get in fights with stalkers or mutants  and mercs especially can drop some insanely good gear and consumables (medicine, food etc).
Its a cod4 map
Me: finishes 2 stalker games<br>Also me: there&#39;s a hotkey for bandages?
I am actually impressed he even TRIED this tbh. <br>I wasn&#39;t expecting him of all people to give a hardcore mod like this the time of day - but I def recommend Anomaly 1.5 instead.<br>Doesn&#39;t need installation or previous titles installed. As Todd says &quot;It just works&quot;

He should try again with just Vanilla Shadow of Chernobyl (on Master Difficulty of course) instead of just diving headfirst into a hardcore mod.
Its quite cool to think that when pewdiepie starts recording he thinks we are all there to be scared shitless with him
I started cringing when he was going inside the lair
Choosing misery as your first stalker experience was not a wise choice Call of chernobyl would have been a better start
Congrats on choosing the most difficult and unforgiving mod! (...well, there&#39;s always Dead Air if you want even more)

Wow i never got the notification for this playthrough
Pewds, this is for you. You must play Stalker 2 once it releases or else...
Imagine playing Stalker for the first time, and you proceed to play the hardest mod for said game.

Stalker isn‚Äôt a indie game. It is created by Ukrainian developers - ‚ÄúGSC game world‚Äù and the first game came out in 2007. There are 3 games - Stalker:Shadow of Chernobyl(2007), Stalker:Clear sky( 2008 ) and Stalker:Call of Pripyat (2009). This mod isn‚Äôt ment for new players... i would suggest mod called ‚ÄúStalker Anomaly‚Äù for better visuals, better gameplay and gunplay or the first vannila game - Stalker:Shadow of chernobyl (with no mods)

Guys, I appeal to you as a trusted and proquanil Stalker.<br>The zone is harsh, you can&#39;t just understand it, there are other qualities needed here. Such as:Courage, intuition, cunning, (speed and strength at the last moment)<br>Don&#39;t think that if you find a person in the middle of the forest,They will help you. You must survive by yourself, train your qualities. And if you trust everyone you meet,you will be robbed and deceived globally. Well, in the Zone you will be known as a Stray dog.<br>By the way, you always look around. Mutants in the Zone, they are also not such degenerates. Given the glitches and bugs of this game.<br>      You live there, you don&#39;t even know what they breathe in Ukraine...

Choosing misery for your first playthrough is like filming a tgf video and then running to the shetland islands and back to film another video. I&#39;ve played the game for over 2 years and haven&#39;t dared to even touch misery. Although it&#39;s good that a huge youtuber is giving attention to an unpolished but amazing game

I can&#39;t believe your playing this game especially with such a brutal mod first too. Watched Mr Sark&#39;s playthrough of the original gameplay and it looks completely insane, you should come back and try that first üòÇ

Play MISERY like first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game, is like start a new civilization in other planet without technology
Shoulda played vanilla first to get the hang of it
get to high ground and scout areas before you go in. avoid combat if possible. stick to roads I think you can hide in pine trees if needed. loot spots are horrible in the misery mod don&#39;t bother unless you need cash.(most I found are bad). drugs, vodka, food and sleeping bag is your lifeline. head shot if any all hostiles. stick to pistol ap and or shotgun early but if you can get a good single shot rifle use it keep them all at a distance.

It sad that you started playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. from Misery. Misery is a hard mod for old players who know monsters&#39; behaving and mechanics of the game. I would recommend you too play Classic SCoP or Anomaly 1.5.0 where you can change difficulty level with many options. Also, I&#39;m russian and I want to say, that &quot;—Å—É–∫–∞&quot; technically must be written as &quot;suka&quot; on english, not as &quot;cyka&quot;.

Felix, please, continue this trip, it is a brilliant game, but you just go in a wrong place to high leveled mutants, and some hints to you : there are a map that can be used by pressing P on keyboard, on map you can find safe places, and please buy shotgun, it is wery good against mutants.

Atmosphere is good, but i don&#39;t understand how it can be that scary for Pewdiepie. Maybe because i&#39;m russian and see this kind of stuff everyday (mutants included).
Reminds me of metro games.
Stalker is not a indie game and its not a Russia simulator
This is Ukraina not Russia
Wowowowowow I&#39;ve wanted to see Pewds play stalker since forever!
In the game USSR never disbanded so its a &quot;Russia Simulator&quot;

Make A Series Of This I Love This Kind Of Game..!!!
Tiny people have telepathy, they will throw things in you, like the flying shotgun, you can loot those zombie corpses you killed, and I suppose you should have a map on button m or p, beware of anomalies, they can kill you instantly, you have screws to drop in them to test for anomaly activity, on button 6, and the octopus guys are called bloodsuckers or smth like that, they are getting almost invisible, but if you&#39;re accurate, you can see them, and just be quite near them, good luck dude. This game is one of the most legendary games in Ukraine and Russia üëå

Actually that&#39;s Pripyat,Ukraine a.k.a Chernobyl Disaster
In this game, actions do not take place in Russia. Judging by the picture that was in the beginning, one can understand that everything is happening in Ukraine. (The picture had the word S.T.A.L.K.E.R) Find it on the Internet: a fire in the Chernobol nuclear power plant. S.T.A.L.K.E.R was created based on this incident.
