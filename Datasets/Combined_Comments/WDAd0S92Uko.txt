Sweetheart you need take your tears to god and he will your tears into smile
This song and this voice kills me! Wow❤
this song hits different a year after going through the worst breakup of my life 😭🫶🏼
Sounds like Adele 🔥
It is Just amazing.
😊😊😊😊
the seceret is in the chin
Was like a drug 🎉
Right back here crying over the same guy 7 years later. Leaving a promise here to myself that I won&#39;t be this stupid again.
Where is the glass breaking and a bad ass bald guy handing out stunners?
A great song by a great singer with great voice 👌👌👏👍
I use to sing this song in the feels but now it represents my situation. I respect his decision, i dont accept it yet im trying to be happy for him, i always wanted him to be happy. But happiness is elsewhere and im stuck looking at my phone.
I feel this song today. ❤<br>I would overcome this pain.<br>I will come out the strongest. Just wait and watch.
Demi is literally more talented then most of the main streamed artists, like Selena , a lot of ppl aside from Selena
😭
Oh hell yeahhh <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDAd0S92Uko&amp;t=196">3:16</a>
WWE Stone Cold : <br>- Hell yeah bitch 🖕🏻🔥
Just right now, i really can feel the lyrics 😊😊😊 &quot;i&#39;m happy for you&quot;
no one can sing this song as good as her.
Her  voice is amazing!!
omg what a vocals
I&#39;ve got a right to pray. Why are we dying? Preying. So as for the constitution?????
This album makes me sad! :(
It’s been 7 years and this song still hits like crazy
Hacia mucho tiempo que no escuchaba realmente su voz, esa que la hace brillar y mostrar quien es interiormente.  <br>Magnífica canción. ❤
This is the best version of demi i still cry if listen to this song❤
I ( JESUS CHINNA CHRIST ) DO NOT SENSE India ( Bharat ) , Europe ( Vatican ) , Usa ( America ) , THEY ARE CHEAPEST IN EVERYTHING . DO EMPTY SCIENCE ELECTRIC .<br>IT IS WAS AND WILL NOT THINK OFF ABOVE THINKING .<br>IT ( EAT ) IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE 💡 .
She is so underrated! She is got a set of pipes on her!
Steve Austin
Songs hit different when you actually feels it<br>With each new drop, Demi Lovato consistently amazes us with her musical prowess, consistently presenting Authentic views as the crucible for unbridled talent, resonating throughout the rhythmic cultural terrain. It serves as the true epicenter where artists forge their paths to greatness. My girl skillfully harnessed its power.
Beautiful song
vocals!!!!!!!
melody would not feel the same, my point,
the only best cover of this song i heard was in the kids voice back then in 2016 by daneliya ...she sang the exact tbh ik that a creator is a creator but that child omg
OMG 😳🤍 I felt her expressions 😩
When there comes pain<br>with catastrophe and sudden rain<br>when you&#39;re crushed, being destroyed your trust<br>cheated by your beloved one<br>to you who was nothing but an angel swan,<br>It&#39;s better to be strong than being bitter to<br>as the person is your love and you were used to<br>so lets her fly rather you cry<br>and to move on, move on and move on...
This song is good,cuz Stone cold said So!
❤️
Girl I’m happy for YOU.  You sang the shit out that song.    <b>Sprinkle sprinkle snap snap</b> yassss
Its so sad that the only thing i saw about her that one day you have to call her they them one they she goes back to she and i never heard this melody intil now
Demi has got to be one of my favourite artists (if not the favourite) in the industry, I love her sooooooooo much, she puts all her heart in her songs and has really great songs not to mention her admirable strength, she went through a lot and still continues to be amazing and I love how genuine and sincere she is, how she’s opened about herself and doesn’t hide anything fearing that it might affect her career in a negative way unlike other celebrities who would have their PR teams covering things up for them, I’m not trying to diss those celebrities though, it’s not the easiest thing to be honest with a world that watches your every single move but I’m saying I love how Demi is brave to face the world and be true to herself no matter what
December 10, 2023 anyone??

Demi, this song is so bittersweet to me in a great way! You go, girl!
I think this song is about letting go
Man Demi is stunning 😍 and her music is lit .!!
My comfort song
What talent  Beautiful!
La musique est géniale en famille 🔥
Vindo aqui pra dizer o quanto essa música me impactou quando terminei com um ex que era meu amigo antes de tudo e quando ele ouviu essa música ficou muito triste pois sabia que eu não estava feliz com ele mesmo ele me amando muito. Hoje queria muito poder dizer pra ele que fui muito bobo de perdê-lo mas a vida seguiu pra ambos.
I can really relate to this song and this helps me to move on, thanks Demi! &lt;3
Say what you may about Demi&#39;s struggles, but no one can deny the gifts this woman possesses.
Here I am listening to this song while my boyfriend is getting marries to another girl next week after dating for 5 years and I can&#39;t hold my tears
demi is the best singer i have ever known. I love this song so much. It contains one of the most genuine vocals.
I don&#39;t like this version. I prefer the live studio version she did in that black and white video
I have no idea why this song less views 😔 she is really amazing 🎉
2023?
It&#39;s touch in deep soul. She&#39;s perfect. Armazing
I thought when my relationship ended a few years ago this hit hard.  But it doesn&#39;t compare to the pain I feel listening to it and singing it about my mother who refuses to love me but loves and appreciates my little sister more than anything else in this world

Super strong signature voice and super touchy song❤
Vocals were good. Lyrics are stupid.
It’s not that serious. I get it. Life goes on. I knew this would happen. I don’t give a fuck. Money is a significant factor/component. I don’t give a fuck.
This song is underrated it hurts !!!
🥺🥰
29/10/2023 😊😊😊
This girl gots pipes.. cant deny that...
Genio, qué voz
Don’t like it much. Too high.  Overly dramatic.  Not appealing to me &amp; others.
What I’m feeling right now 😢. “If happy is her, I’m happy for you Ki. Hope you both happy together.”
This is honestly her best song yet🥺. She really showcased her vocals, emotion, pitch and everything else into this!
Randomly remembered this song
Just wow
I thought this video was about the texas rattlesnake steve austin 👎

This song is a soul-stirring journey through heartbreak. Demi Lovato&#39;s vocals are nothing short of stunning.

When my ex left me this is the song I screamed. Her music got me through a couple tough times in my life.
Me, 7 years into instant tears whenever I&#39;m hearing just one note of this song: I&#39;m not crying, you&#39;re cring!
<b>This song emotionally breaks me to this day... what a freaking masterpiece.</b>
This song just...<br>It feels like she ripped into my heart and said exactly how I still feel. 💔

Never heard of this before, until today Excellent song ❤️❤❤❤❤❤
I came here for Stone Cold. Obviously I was disappointed 😢@Austin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDAd0S92Uko&amp;t=196">3:16</a>
Steve Austin, next music
&quot;if happy is her, I&#39;m happy for you&quot;
She’s one of the artists we’ll see in 100+ years in choir classes. Absolutely having full control over her voice will serve her well in the years to come
God her voice is just GOD. So underrated. 100%
I can feel so much of her in this video AND song
O mãe foi meus amigo

We need  this  Demi back,,

The voice is wow😮❤
Sometimes, I think, celebrities lose in love simply because they can love fully where they are, but, their loved ones want something more focused on them. A homebody. The ones who can respect where each other is at and love them for who they are, succeed.
i was looking for steve austin but this will do
Her pale skin and dark hair against the snow is so beautiful
i miss the old her
Thank is song

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Learning To Love Myself” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💕

DEMI LOVATO STONE COLD VEVO DEMI LOVATO
If girl says this, it means she truly love him, not selfish, but higher, agape, insane love<br>She ready to sacrifice own plans, hopes for happiness this man
HER voice is so powerful wow,SHE is an amazing beautiful and talented WOMAN.
tem futuro
essa musica é boa mesmo
Wow! Wow! Wow! Quel voix extraordinaire, wow! Et que dire des paroles...quand j&#39;ai traduit toutes les paroles, en français,  j&#39;ai fait rejoué la chanson! Et en sachant ce que ces mots voulait dire, dans ma langue, le français, premièrement les larmes ont coulés, c&#39;est sûr, mais pleins de frissons ont parcourus mon corps...( je vis une relation à distance avec mon copain, car il est camionneur, travaillant 70 heures par semaines, et je trouve ça très  dure, surtout que c&#39;est la 1ere relation à distance, que je vit, c&#39;est tellement dure de ne pas pouvoir serrer, l&#39;être aimé, dans nos bras,  Pourtant, on dirait que lui, ça ne lui fait rien. Avec toutes les épreuves que Dieu sème sur notre route, l&#39;enfer ne peux pas être plus pire que cela et jamais je n&#39;aurais pensé que le corps humain pouvait nous faire pleurer, autant que cela. VRAIMENT, Demi , BRAVO, BRAVO,  BRAVO.  20000000 ☆ SUR 5
Her voice just makes me feel so much.
très belle chanson. . . tu es une artiste extraordinaire, je t&#39;aime de tout mon coeur
Aunque los años pasen me seguirá causando escalofríos

After watching American idol❤
Man. She was so talented before she went crazy. This woman, female, girl, lady, gal, chick, went off her rocker.
When you just happen to fall for a girl with a man💀
This is such a beautiful song and her voice is  so awesome!
Demi Lovato I care about you I want to let you know I want to do 25 songs with you in the studio
i want to like it as many time as i watch and watch and watch and watch this video ...................
2023 and counting 🤞🏾❤️💕😻
Bah god
Sabe a dor? ela dói!
No grammy trophy? Really?
These vocale are epic!!  End of story
Perfeita
I don&#39;t have that much but I want to brake bread with you and I want to give you some of my inventor money
Arte arte arte arte
they / them ?
just love save
This so much speaks volumes to me!!!! I feel everyone and their comments! I had a 27 year relationship with a man and 5 children plus grandchildren. He chose himself and his selfish needs above us. Not okay! When my youngest child was 14 , he(the father) started screwing an 18 year old at his work. Devastating for us all! Truth is he truly scarred us all for life. Also truth is we have each other and he can roll the fuck on!! Actions prove it all! If anyone out there is in this situation… I got you!! Rise above and walk away and run from the narcissist!! Sharing love and inspiration to you all!!!!!!
If happy is her im happy for you ❤️
What?!
Como depois de 7 anos eu não me curei ainda? Será a saudade da minha mãe que se foi e ele ficou e depois me deixou? Será amor de verdade? São 7 anos sendo 5 sem você e eu não consegui superar isso por que? Carma? Não existe mais uma vida para nós dois juntos e o pobre do meu coração não entende isso💔 Por que você insiste em viver em mim? São tantas perguntas,sonhos que não se realizaram. Que Deus tenha piedade da minha alma e me faça esquecer aquele amor de 10 anos atrás 🥺🖤eu preciso esquecer ooo Deus me ajude eu não posso enlouquecer 🚶‍♀️
And that’s the bottom line<br><br>Cause Demi Lovato said so
To: Demi Lovato, American Singer<br><br> <br><br>I am appalled by your recent blasphemous cover album.<br><br> <br><br>It openly dishonors Jesus Christ, mocks the crucifix and offends Christians worldwide!<br><br> <br><br>I demand that you immediately remove the album and stop its promotion and circulation.<br><br> <br><br>Sincerely,
This song is a good one. It reminds all of us that Christ Died for our sins. It is the truth. He Is our Savior. Thanks Demi.
❤❤❤
A natural beauty
This is how I feel ryt now I though I found my loved one yet it was just a fairytale...I guess u never know wen u got the right 1 but what can we say it&#39;s life ...

Stone cold, stone cold<br>You see me standing, but I&#39;m dying on the floor<br>Stone cold, stone cold<br>Maybe if I don&#39;t cry, I won&#39;t feel anymore<br>Stone cold, baby<br>God knows I try to feel<br>Happy for you<br>Know that I am, even if I<br>Can&#39;t understand, I&#39;ll take the pain<br>Give me the truth, me and my heart<br>We&#39;ll make it through<br>If happy is her, I&#39;m happy for you<br>Stone cold, stone cold<br>You&#39;re dancing with her, while I&#39;m staring at my phone<br>Stone cold, stone cold<br>I was your amber, but now she&#39;s your shade of gold<br>Stone cold, baby<br>God knows I try to feel<br>Happy for you<br>Know that I am, even if I<br>Can&#39;t understand, I&#39;ll take the pain<br>Give me the truth, me and my heart<br>We&#39;ll make it through<br>If happy is her, I&#39;m happy for you<br>Don&#39;t wanna be stone cold, stone<br>I wish I could mean this, but here&#39;s my goodbye<br>Oh, I&#39;m happy for you<br>Know that I am, even if I<br>Can&#39;t understand<br>If happy is her<br>If happy is her<br>I&#39;m happy for you

Can&#39;t believe Stone Cold allowed this crap
🇧🇷😍
This song is f**king underrated what a masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥
Incantevole Demi❤ hai una voce straordinaria
Jesus Christ loves you too much so please turn to Him, repent and let Him guide you to peace
If happy is her I’m happy for you…. My ex had a double life for a whole year. I’m broken and he hasn’t apologized or said a damn word but I blocked him I have the worst anxiety can’t even work rn it’s so pathetic.
ive been practicing this song ever since i was in 2nd grade (now a freshman in college) and i can finally belt this song ☺️<br>edit: okay not 2nd grade i keep thinking im like double digit age at 2nd grade 💀
STone COLD BAAAABY
This song has nothing to do with Stone Cold Steve Austin... I&#39;m disappointed haha
de vez en cuando vengo aqui , no creo que leas esto , pero , te quiero…
2023 anyone???<br><br>😍
Música mais linda
I know she had to be special to be one of Simon&#39;s judges but, I never saw her perform and never heard her songs on radio/ media. <br>      Today I heard a kid sing a song on YouTube The Voice called Stone Cold it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Soooo I looked up song and found Demi&#39;s video. You guessed it I thought she did a cover so I looked for original and was blown away. I had no idea this woman had such MAJESTIC TALENT.🤯💥🏆🎉<br>         I always admired her being an advocate for mental health now I&#39;m a fan of her voice and persona too. BTW the video was stunning. 😍<br>       I wish her greater success , respect, personal growth and joy.
Stone cold Steve Austin
~ i salute you of being a good singer performer....just keep on singin&#39; ...<br>~ 🌷🎶🎤❤🤘🌷
I just gave permission to the guy I love to find a new girl because he&#39;s tired of waiting for me. This hits like a brick to the heart
This song makes me feel calm
Woah😥❤
É bom saber que ela deu a volta por cima em vários aspectos na vida dela,sempre me identifiquei e gosto da Demi
Omg this is amazing…it’s already one of my favourite songs ❤❤😍
OMG!!! She has a new fan!!!🔥🔥🔥
Oh wow😮
Quality of Grammy has deteriorated in recent years <br>Useless song are getting awards with useless lyrics which consists only slang words like PUSSY COCK etc etc. <br>It is giving awards to artist like CARDI B whose lyrics are worst than ever
daşak
Still one of my favorite songs  <br>Every time i listen to this i say &quot; i  love this amazing  voice  !! &quot;<br>and what a beautiful lyrics!!<br> it&#39;s just so touched 💔 <br>I love you so much Demi!!!<br>Please keep singing 💜
I miss her..💔
está canción ahora es mi aliada
Demi is a perfect single, i love she so much.
Wow!
She sings son well, because of the high notes, but her voice is so annoying - _-
What a vocal<br>.....❤️❤️
I suggest you watch the cover of Morissette Amon of Stone Cold. It is a better version. You will be left in AWE!    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9J8gTdpSjo
She nailed it ❤❤❤❤
I&#39;m not a huge Demi Lovato fan but this song is so beautiful and her vocals are great. You can almost feel her emotions listening to this.
I love you D! 😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍
high notes higher than my grades fr
Demi should be a Grammy award winning artist. She certainly is worthy of it!!
❤
ชอบเพลงนี้มากค่ะ
❤️❤️❤️🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿
This was definitely about Selena leaving her for Taylor
Perfect 😍
STEVE AUSTIN STEVE AUSTIN!!!
Best cover from Daneliya Tuleshova!
How did the sound engineer manage to not be driven crazy ? How did he cope with theses vocal varations ?

Going for 2023 and still fire
A song from an era when Demi was still sane 😓
Best Demi levato song ever
Wonderful😍!!! Golden voice! extremely exciting, unattainable, sentimental, suffered
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
forever , love her voice and this song
Ano passado chorei muito ouvindo essa música
Coming back in the hopes we get music like this again someday
desde hace 6 años esta cancion me causa escalos frios, no puede tener una voz tan poderosa! te amo demi
Damn!  I didn&#39;t know that Demi had all that sound and range! Nice. 🥰
2022.. Still stone cold. I love this song so much. ❤️
You re enourmous strong
Missed this era &lt;/3 i remember listening to this 4 years ago, It was my favourite 😢😢😢
beautiful    dera
Listened it 5years ago and still hits same 😓
“That’s why you use autotune and I don’t” 🤦🏻‍♀️ That guy was just frustrated.
I&#39;ve watched/listened to this so many times and it never fails to amaze me how much talent you have.  Your voice is so raw and full of emotion.  It&#39;s like you bared your soul for everyone to see and it makes you so beautiful.  I&#39;m in awe of how great this performance is.
Everytime i listen to this song, it reminds me of the little boy in the elevator belting the F out of the song. The lower the elevator went, the higher and brighter his notes became.
cool

Cómo no escuché antes ese tema se me puso la piel de gallina de lo que transmite la canción 😱😢
Please forgive me, I really suck at first impressions. Just flat tell Max to fuck off. Let Fez worry about himself.

Bravooooooo❤
The Rapture<br><br>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.<br>1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events.<br>Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life.<br>I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live.<br>Deuteronomy 30:19 R.M<br><br>WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?
Hey it&#39;s me from 2022 :)
“I was your amber but now she’s your shade of gold”<br>That hit so deep<br>Demi Lovato never fails to touch my heart

Hello
Those high notes and rifts send chills down my spine every time. Miss Lovato is the epitome of &#39;her voice is her instrument.&#39; She could do this A Cappella and it wouldn&#39;t take away a thing!
Stone Cold/Demi Lovato - lyrics<br><br>Stone cold, stone cold<br>You see me standing, but I&#39;m dying on the floor<br>Stone cold, stone cold<br>Maybe if I don&#39;t cry, I won&#39;t feel anymore<br><br>Stone cold, baby<br>God knows I try to feel<br>Happy for you<br>Know that I am, even if I<br>Can&#39;t understand, I&#39;ll take the pain<br>Give me the truth, me and my heart<br>We&#39;ll make it through<br>If happy is her, I&#39;m happy for you<br><br>Stone cold, stone cold<br>You&#39;re dancing with her, while I&#39;m staring at my phone<br>Stone cold, stone cold<br>I was your amber, but now she&#39;s your shade of gold<br><br>Stone cold, baby<br>God knows I try to feel<br>Happy for you<br>Know that I am, even if I<br>Can&#39;t understand, I&#39;ll take the pain<br>Give me the truth, me and my heart<br>We&#39;ll make it through<br>If happy is her, I&#39;m happy for you<br><br>Don&#39;t wanna be stone cold, stone<br>I wish I could mean this, but here&#39;s my goodbye<br>Oh, I&#39;m happy for you<br>Know that I am, even if I<br>Can&#39;t understand<br>If happy is her<br>If happy is her<br>I&#39;m happy for you

How I feel right now. .sad 😭
Have u seen the little girl Danelia from The Voice Ukraine singing this. She did AMAZING 🔥
Stone cold Steve Austin
I&#39;ve known who Demi Lovato was for years but never listened to any of her songs.  I&#39;m an old guy, child of the 80&#39;s.  But color me impressed.  That was authentic and intense.
Man this song 🤕
😍😍😍😍
She controles her voice so well
My Demi....
Even if I don’t understand.If happy is her , I’m happy for you
i&#39;m  crying every time i listen.
Sin dudas, tiene una vos increíble, es una pena que la gente solo se guíe por los dramas personales y no escuche y valore su maravillosa vos, sin hablar de sus letras.

Demi lovato vs ADELE Who will win the Grammys
I think this is her best song
Watching in 2022
7 years later first time watching this vid
I always liked this song. <br><br>It&#39;s hard to believe this &quot;non binary&quot; person today, singing to ghosts and having a shaved head with a spider tattoo on her scalp is the same person.
2022?
😓😩😫😭😢😥😪
2022?
You can see the real pain in her face in this video she put her all into this song and it shows
Listen to Daneliya Tuleshewa from Kazakhstan,  she performed this song in Voice kids Ukraine when she was 10 years old! ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍👍
