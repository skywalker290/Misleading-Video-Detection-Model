My review :-<br>Man I can&#39;t believe this movie is from bollywood.<br>I just came out of watching this and what a story! I was thinking like I&#39;m reading a book the whole time.<br>At the beginning of movie I was thinking that this one too is another bollywood s**t but as the movie proceeds specially the second half... just goosebumps. <br>It contains a lesson to remember for the rest of the life which you&#39;ll get after watching the whole movie. <br>Dhanush and Sonam acted brilliantly.<br>The songs, the story, the title all blends perfectly.<br>The climax was unexpected and left me with tears and whosever is reading this review I just want to say go and watch this movie and experience this journey of love by yourself you&#39;ll love it.<br>A must watch movie and a movie to remember for lifetime. тЭдя╕П

Mast movie ЁЯСН
I know it&#39;s not the best love story but for me Kundan&#39;s love is far better than Kabir singh
Everything in this world is temporary except love. To love someone unconditionally тАФ to say a little more, to show a little more, to love a little more in life, and to keep someone&#39;s else heart safe is the biggest responsibility then. Kundan, all of us want to be loved but how many of us just want to love someone with all our heart and skin, and to believe that what a beautiful feeling is to have found someone worth being vulnerable for isn&#39;t a myth in reality.<br><br>Kundan you were like those etched poems still trying to complete itself by looking for happiness in Zoya&#39;s smile. You kept her in your prayers, and you made sure she found her happiness in the person she loved. writing this letter to you is just a small way to remind you that both of you still share the silver sky, somehow somewhere.<br><br>Sometimes when you love someone and lose them it is because maybe our knees have refused to kneel for the prayer to be said to let that person be freed eternally. To love and to wear vulnerabilities on your shoulder takes courage and you were an embodiment of that and these words of mine couldn&#39;t put your love and longing for her in words, but would speak of all those silences spoken between both of you in those exchanged glances in some parallel universe. When your home of love is thatched from pillars of grief, all the unspent love in the corner of your hearts rents a part of your skin to live there as a remembrance for a lifetime because you know the biggest tragedy is that grief here has no place of to go.<br><br>Kundan your love for her cannot begin and cannot ever end, and I hope you know that?<br><br>But, in a parallel world maybe, you and Zoya would collide together through different timelines, looking at each other for a lifetime until both of you finally stay and the space dust would end up whispering I love you&#39;s to you.<br><br>For every time your heart beats it says to her &#39;Tum tak tum tak tum tak,&#39;<br><br>тАФ with love and prayers and a little bit love.

I watched this movie when I was like 9 or something and I didn&#39;t understand it too well lol. But Swara needs to be appreciated for this movie. She was better than Sonam
Lol am I the only one who is watching this movie or trailer in 2020
One of my favorite trailer.
Horrible movie. People who are blaming the character Zoya shows that how South Asians are still so misogynist.
Dis movie feels like a beautiful novel

Ful movie dawonload karo yaar
In this movie Sooonam is look like my school time girlfriend.... whenever I listening ranjhana movie songs I totally felt in memories of my school and girl ЁЯШн but unfortunately she got married in last year.....
The reason there are female harassment cases still prevailing, is this romanticizing  the creepy stalking of a women.... who&#39;s clearly not interested. Do the writers even know kitni gandi feeling aati h when someone keeps stalking u to the every single place u go? Kaise pata hoga, all r male, and all the wanna do is please their thrki male audience and console them by giving wrong ideas ki ladki ne na bola, toh bhav kha rhi hai and what bullshit, she&#39;s totally not creeped out by ur disgusting behaviour, right? ЁЯЩДЁЯЩДЁЯЩД
2020?
One f my fvrt film
Trailer looks interesting like a simple love story movie as usual with lots of twist but that is not actually .. It&#39;s too much complicated and many many much emotional ....<br>It&#39;s not just a movie , seems much like reality (whoever saw this movie will understand better) .. Maximum love story movie contain so much unreality and too much shitty stuff ... &quot;Raanjhanaa&quot; - it&#39;s a masterpiece .. A best love story based one I have ever watched .......
Terribly waiting for atrangi re

No one could play Zoya&#39;s role better than Sonam Kapoor.
bekar movie he ....ek ladka jo bachpan se ek ladki ko pyar krta he ...or ladki lgatar uska chutiya katti rehti he...fir bhi ladka usi ke pas apna katvane jata he...bollywood movies me ladke k pas koi kam dhandha nhi hota kya ya sirf pyar hi krne ko hota he...it&#39;s misleading our generation
Raanjhna is one of the best movie I have ever seen in my life..I have watched this movie many times but still can&#39;t get over it...it still gives me goosebumps as if I m watching this for the first time...... awesome acting,story,music...ЁЯСМЁЯСМ amazing movie....I hope that more such types of movies to come... тЭдя╕ПтЭдя╕ПЁЯЩВ

Props to Sonam for signing up for this film, there are actresses in bollywood who would have flat out refused to work as Dhanush&#39;s romantic interest purely because he is darker skinned. This film really made me like Sonam

Damn Damn Damn Damn┬аFucking good movie for fuck&#39;s sake fucking himanshu sharma is a fucking genius Bollywood needs more writers like him these days fucking Bollywood movies are a disgrace because of their lack of originality in their pursuit of incorporating ideals, values, and beliefs from the western world. It was beautiful to see lots of india in an indian movie.

Anyone know where I can find the music piece that starts at 25 seconds?
Vijayalakshmi Ashokkumar┬аHaha....u have tried to mention people from one particular region in a very biased way...Such a narrow mind and such a narrow thought can come from people like u...what about Abhay deol and Swara bhaskar...<br>Dont try to make Dhanush a south indian before indian...all the international applause he is getting is because of bollywood film industry... Secondly, he is loved by everyone so dont try to show he is from South...lolzz..<br><br>Now try to delete this thread and show me...haha
I think sonam did a great job in this movie i dont understand why most of the people dont like her acting she is not that bad ...i get to know that there is an actor called dhanush just by this movie and now he is one of my favorite actors of bollywood ...great movie 
i still feel sad about the end but this film is sooooo greattt bravoooo

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER9vmhxFucg&amp;t=25">0:25</a> song name plz?
Didn&#39;t even know who this Danush guy was and never heard of this movie either, but happen to see it on tele yesterday and when i saw Danush as a hero i was wondering what&#39;s going wrong in Bollywood, but all that changed after 20 minutes into the movie and his looks didn&#39;t matter as his acting and subject of the movie was so strong. Good to know Bollywood is still making movies with something in it rather than just bang bang crap.
Good

i really really love this movie!! peace from Malaysia
this movie is really depressing┬а
superb i like it
The film wasn&#39;t successful, because it gets very depressing &amp; dark in the 2nd half. But Dhanush is a very good actor.
i yam froma papu nu guiena
I love to see this movie but im from Philippines..
Love dhanush!!
 He&#39;s a good actor, dancer, and singer!
Hahaha.. Just because you are a Ajith fan and Ajith is a big flop in Bollywood ( Ajith acted as SRK&#39;s brother in Ashoka ) you are not able to digest Dhanush&#39;s success lol.. Dhanush earns a lot and produces movies and makes big money, so stop bulllshitting about his father cheated 2 crores.. 
This was Bollywood&#39;s best of 2013

Poor, Ayesha, you start worshiping a person, this is what you get at last. However, love you give them make them feel incomplete though they have everything in life. It is always a power struggle. Worshiper is an awesome gift any person can every get in their lives. Sad part is being worshiper you get nothing but winning heart with nothing left in life than triumph.
its a bloody BS movie.. the heroine was sooooooooo stupid n her character was so negative n full of attitude.. sali nahi shadi karni thi tuo kyu dost bna bna k ckipakti rehti thi, fazool mein larkay ki jaan lay li.. huhhhhh :@ poor kundan died :(
You never seen those movie awards then, American hollywood movies do make it to the Oscar awards. That&#39;s why there&#39;s American Movie Awards, Oscar awards etc. Face it, these Bollywood movies should just stick to their own kind and not try to copy other movies.
Amazing movie and great plot
Dhanush&#39;s acting was flawless.
He is going to go very far. 
Awesome Movie!!

rajhana ek mast movie hai.

What a movie. maahn seriously. dhanush deserves more than a billion claps. 
&quot;Dhanush is a die hard Ajith fan.He has said in many occasions.Always talented artist support talented actors.Personally i like Dhanush very much.I watched Ranjahnna mind blowing performance by Dhanush.Best of luck for UR bollywood carrier by Die hard AJITH FAN&quot;.- This is your comment 4 months ago on mariyan trailer. What happened to you in 4 months? oh.. u r an ajith fan that&#39;s why.
I was talking about the bengali films and I am sure there are lots of acclaimed directors and actors who are constantly trying to take Indian cinema to a new level but to you and certain other ppl Indian cinema comprises of only masala bollywood film. Remember that the so called blockbuster holly films don&#39;t make to oscars....story matters and we have loads of them
Sorry, never heard of whatever you&#39;re talking about. And i am grown up. I just dislike many hindu movies out there that just tries to look good and copy American movies.
the indian cinema has a rich diaspora of bengali films , old classic hindi films, southern films and you say that they cannot compete with hollywood cinemas. I myself being a bengali is proud of the veteran directors like mrinal sen, rhitwik ghatak, satyajit ray and more recently rituporno ghosh, aparna sen, Gotam ghosh,Anjan Dutta. Grow up will you and learn to be proud of your nation
indian movies will never be anything like actual hollywood movies.... ;) They should make an indian bollywood called Taxi, it&#39;d at least best describe one. LOL!
U KICK MAH DOG!
shut up you hairy elephant
nuts.
Sonam and Abhay chemistry was awesome. They should act in a love story in future, wil be great.
Dude, the movie released in July 2013 and is out of theatre&#39;s as well.

I would like to figure out how to attract women. My good friend has started dating a 10 because 2 months back he registered to a website named Master Attraction (Google it if you wish to learn how.) I&#39;m so envious because I wish to fall in love too. How come it&#39;s so difficult? I&#39;m going to take a peek at this Jake Ayres man&#39;s emails. Surprising point is, he used to have no joy with girls. How can you transform so swiftly? His girl&#39;s a fucking model!
He is a good actor but he is dangerously skinny.
I want this starting track .. if anyone knows where can i find it please help me out.. just send a link for download on priyanka1991990desai@gmail.com


Very Good
seriously dis mve was great ,, no words 4 dhanush

crazy.c my conversation full. that guy insults dhanush as ugly.so i countered him. wats der in that? stupid girl. go and get life...

ha ha Cheers bro....:) 
OMG I loved this movie !!! Dhaush &lt;3 
Yuva raja i guess you must be some kind off a hot model to say that?
#I AGREE THAT DHANUSH IS UGLY# then u should be a mirror cracking material :p

moral of the story...never love a muslim girl
WHERE TO GET THE SEHNAI BACKGROUND MUSIC USED.. PLZ URGENT HELP

Just watched the movie. So heartbreaking! Really good movie. 
Osam
osm...


Amazing movie!!!
they doesnt fall in love.watch the movie first then comment.

ni amma pooka lanja munda koda
dont be racist....Dhanus&#39; acting was superb in this movie
Dhanush is very simple n good looking, his acting is very much real. Lots of love from - all Rajasthan (India)
Hello this is a place for astrology . Seriously stay In your field
Yup Dhanush Rocks ..he&#39;s amazingly awesome in this movie !and  i m also from North, bt we all have only One Identity bro ..n i.e &quot; Proud Indian &quot; :)
seriously , One of the best Movie i have ever watched . Hats off to Dhanush&#39;s acting .you deserve all awards 
wtf don&#39;t u know the actor Dhanush....he is the son-in-law of Rajinikanth and he is the youngest actor to earn the national award and you say he doesn&#39;t interest you at all while the doll face Sonam with stoned expression interest you. Go to hell....the film was carried by Dhanush and Dhanush alone
i saw this movie last night i just cant get out of this lovestory..its stuck in my mind!!! HATSOFF TO THE STORY WRITER, DIRECTOR ,DHANUSH, AR REHMAN AND EVERYONE WHO WAS A PART.
Beyond the borders of Bollywood, not a lollypop love story.
I would just say:
simply beautiful
beautifully simple
atleast this film was better tham those stupid love stories 
love the songs as well
----&gt; Danush &lt;---- the Superstar 
i am surprised that; how your agree that he is Ugly ... i like him very much and lots of people around the world like him ,,
we all love Danush ...  he is the superstar :)))))

Disappoint to know that, people still want to see the good faces not good acting..,
Danush is not good, he is Amazing
Thanks for spoiling the movie!
the best movie ever...it shows real and true insanity that can happen in love when one falls for someone from the DEPTH of their heart... zoya loved &quot;akram zaidi&quot; with the same depth and kundan loved zoya in tht manner... both loved but just not each other.. gives a climpse of reality since they didnt have a happy ending..
flop actor? ha!
i lobe this song

Loved the scene at 2:05 very well executed!
This Movie was Different &amp; special from the cinema i have seen.
I didn&#39;t expected much from this sonam-starrer. Yes, I am saying Sonam only because i really wasn&#39;t interested in the actor at all.
I watched this film 3-4 days back. And I really loved the movie overall.
The Theme, characters, THE MUSIC,direction, dialouges, dance. Everything was just perfect. Lastly, Dhanush Hats off. RESPECT.
500 words r less to write about this movie. Plz thumbs UP so that Dhanush sees this
you call that handsome blukhhh

UGLY TAMIL GUY? DONT BLUFF OK GO AND CHECK TAMIL ACTOR AJITH KUMAR HE IS HANDSOME AND STYLISH STAR IN WHOLE INDIA SO OUR TAMIL IS BETTER THAN URS GO AND CHECK ACTOR AJITH KUMAR
I AGREE THAT DHANUSH IS UGLY BUT HE IS TALENTED ACTOR AND SINGING, DANCING, HE IS TALENTED ACTOR OK AND HE IS SON IN LAW OF SUPER STAR RAJINIKANTH SO STOP HATING
Best movie of the year
Best of the year
Best movie of the year...
I didn&#39;t expect it to be good but it was a really good movie.  Loved it.
It&#39;s really shameful that a fake and immature film like YEH JAWEANI HAI DEEWANI has done better business than RAANJHANAA the ultimate love story.It reflects the mindset of today&#39;s youngsters who have became completely fake after using FAKEBOOK.
RAANJHANAA is the best love story ever made in INDIA,good acting ,good cinematography, good songs, good dialogues,etcThe film has exposed the true character of indian girls of 21&#39;st century,only a boy who has been in true love with a girl can understand this movie,others will not at all understandDHANUSH looks like a true MARD,he is more HERIOC than fair and GAY type actors like SHAHID KAPOOR,RITESH,TUSHAR KAPUR,JACKKY BHAGNANI,IMRAN KHAN KYA YEHI PYAR HAI is as also as good movie as RAANJHANA
good
trashy acting low class stars.
I saw this movie it was thrash
check out this page its hilarious /user/GurianNewsNetwork
I seriously can&#39;t find a betr replacement for this role , he was brilliant aftr seeing this movie I saw many tamils of his he was even betr ter, Now I understand why bollywood remakes tamil films they are too good there are many gr8 movies yet 2 be remade waiting for that !!!!!!!!!:)
Amazing movie
My fav
You are right, We all need to broaden our horizon &amp; soon or else our corrupt politicians will reap the benefits by creating more issues.
Well said:)
agar ab bhi nae bole..to sale
ladki ke walime mae firnee khate dikhoge 
if people are hating on him than they are missing one of the better movies of the past 2-3 years,  i went into this thinking its gonna be average and it turned out to be a great movie

why are people hating on him is beyond me 
I agree that dhanush is ugly but he is a brilliant actor and a very modest actor. And they needed a mediocre looking guy for this role. What&#39;s people problem? Rock on dhanush. And ya. I&#39;m a North Indian
Great movie, hats off to Dhanush! :) 
let me continue ur last word...grossED more than 100 crores...this movie without Dhanush wld have been a flop...Majority of audiences loved the movie...u belong to the insignificant fraction of audiences...that can glorify western&#39;s poops as gold...do u get it? u belong to tht category....its meaningless to argue with ur type of level of ppl...lolll
WOW! why so much hatred on Dhanush? Only based on his looks? Let me remind you that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, you may consider yourself the most attractive person in the world while others might find you ugly. Learn to privilege inner beauty because that is REAL beauty. That would make you sound less shallow. Also, instead of writing mean comments on someone&#39;s looks, please spend your time on educating yourself. You have a LONG way to go. God bless you :) 
@bwooodstar Can u pls stop praising yourself n stop annoying people
Gharephal nitesh
more famous than you too. but at least im better looking than this ugly tamil guy lol flop actor
Happy B&#39;day DHANUSH :)))
nice movie  bhai dhanush
VAIN AND OBSCURE.... DO YOU REALIZE THAT HE IS MORE FAMOUS THAN WHAT YOU WILL EVER BE....LOL...
it is not really a song, it is just a tune
which song is this? from @0:25 till 0:35
EW HES SO UGLY AND DARK gross
Dhanush...... Just loved you in this movie...... Superb movie......... Superb trailer!

2013 best movie 
Dhnuss you r to good
NICE
SOOOOOOOOOO GUD

Well everyone knows Rajini sir. He looks very dark and not that good looking however he is a superstar in Tamil industry. People who live in simplicity and down to earth are the people who reach the top. Rajini sir was a bus conductor before he came to the movie industry, where is he now?
Raanjhanaa just crossed the 100 crore mark... IN YOUR FACE DHANUSH HATERS!!! 
GO DHANUSH
Just perfect movie to watch. Haters gona hate guys so no point even arguing kuz we no how special movie is this.
jo ladka soya nam ke ladki ke peeche gaya oh kuthe ki mouth mara (jannath 1,ishqzyade)
i sound like fun...well you spot me right on thats becuase i am a very fun loving vibrant personality, but anyway that is so commendable that your ready to convert to you lady loves religion which is islam i think if she hears this news she will be blown away with the intensity of your love, but remember one thing boy you gotta be committed once you convert its not a joke you know firstly how old are you and your girl your in love with and secondly what city you from if u dont mind me asking.
this movie reminds me of my story 
shit :(
Its hilarious when Kundan forgets his own wedding XD 
hi whats up Antonio the new kundan in town lol jokes apart love is always love and so pure that nothing can come between we are meant to respect each others religions not disrespect them, If you love the muslim girl passionately then i strongly recommend that you confess your love to her unless its to late, but remember kundan&#39;s love was so intense that he was ready to convert in his lady loves religion now that is something to die for right, if you love her with a true heart go the kundan way.
HIE

HIE HOW ARE YOU?
hie
want to watch this looks so fanny :)))
thanks Ninnie Tom for supporting your right love is always love and so pure that nothing can come between we are meant to respect each others religions not disrespect them, i mean come on why would i reject a guy like kundan whom has so much love to give, why would i reject his unconditional love because his opposition of religion and then again kundan love was so intense that he was ready to convert in his loves religion now that is something to acknowledge
Sometimes you just have to think further than just looking at the religions of th 2 lovers..
Far im gonna hate sonam kapoor now in any movies of hers!! Like serious, kundan loved her so much O.O , i wish someone loves me as much as he does to her, and i would love him back in return,&lt;3 who gives if that boy is not &#39;&#39;educated&#39;&#39;..... i mean hees definitely educated in how to love ! 
What kind of muslim girl are you? Swearing in Ramadan..and thanks for spoiling the film :)
i&#39;m with you
superb   i love the movie ...........
Sonam should get some support aswell in 1,000 comments she is only mentioned once thumbs up if you think she did a good job
I agree with aiza Hassan but not only that, religion is to bring people together,not apart....Love is always love and the strongest element in a human.
No use of arguing with a Dumbass,thats why i took a time for reply for such a stupid comment..
&quot;you forget me, mmmuahh!&quot; I Love You Kundan &lt;3
john abraham is a half south indian
Best movie of the year... (till now). Dhanush.... brilliant.
I agree what an acting in that movie from Dhanush:)

iwatchthivideo

itna saal laga ek south indian ko accept karne ke liye.  yeh hosh jab kamal hassan bollywood mein acting shuru kiya thab kartha tho behtharian films mil sakta tha. Aur bhi talented actors are there in south like surya, vikram, mohanlal go and watch there movies also. 
Well in that case...I love you!!! :)
nice movie...dhanush a really talented actor!

You please see the suicidal scene of Dhanush in Tamil Film &quot;three&#39; available in Utube, you will cry.
hey its kool i know your just saying it all in good humour.its ok dont worry.
interesting movie wanna see this 
Dhanush is the best &lt;3

After reading some of the comments.. one thing s clear that many assume that ppl from south are not good looking and believe any skin shade less than moon white is black !!!
I don&#39;t know which gentle-man n tis World declared south indians are not good looking !!! If u think so.. I am sorry to say that u are living inside a well.. Jump out !!!
so i love u
Pizza never overtakes Dosa and Panipuri(Our inventions suits us better).....Chak de INDIA..
Thanks for recognizing Dhanush....
bcoz muslim girl(sonam) is loving a hindu guy (abhay deol) that&#39;s what the censor board in pakistan said according to the newspapers.
ASDFGHJK


it doesn&#39;t want it&#39;s people to experience pure love
I saw this movie in the US and perhaps because I live in a larger city. Do a google search &quot;Raanjhanaa showtimes yourcity&quot;, you&#39;ll find a nearest theater. If no results within drivable distance, wait until DVD release. Even though I was lucky to find a theater within 10min drive - trust me - this movie is worth watching in a theater even if you have to drive 100-200 miles long distance. So you have plenty of options, even if you live in a small town.
I don&#39;t know abt colour...but the guy in this movie done awesome role....
They suck....
He himself had a dialog in a movie which quotes&quot;there is only 2% of guys looks like a srk or salman rest of the guys look like me you have to love us&quot;
people like danush, boman irani, arshad warsi are better than some A list actors. 

you sir are disgusting, if you think skin color and looks are essential for good acting then you are an idiot and are out of your senses
Am Persian n a love ondian movies thum up for bollywood
Why is tgis trailor so long
Aiza,
tu mere liye kya kr sakti hai?
mujhse kitna pyar krti hai tu?

jhut bol k khud ko tasalli nai sach bol k mujhe tasalli de..
yes... well said.... nyc

Who the fuck says you look like Katrina Kaif, and yeah sure its easy to type shit on youtube, 99.99% of girls are superficial and you certainly are not an exception. The first thing you said is I look like Katrina Kaif. Stop chatting shit on youtube.
LoL besides i pray to God that you definitely find your zoya that loves you.
lol trust me there are many girls like me with a good heart but there are not enough guys like kundan out there
well if someone loves me to the extent and intense of kundan&#39;s love then i can do ANYTHING for that boy.
yep man. fans got shocked by watching this. fans got shocked when kareena kapoor smashed on the news reader in public. she must be mad.

you can also watch it here   -&gt; bit.ly/155e2RO?=bjegv
Awsome movie and this is really true as happened in movie do not trust on every one trust the right girl ... Awsome movie gr8 message for the youths... 
well i look like katrina kaif and if he had come in my life i woulde of married him,
hai danush you welcome to baliwood
I love this film. When I first saw the trailer of this film I said to myself what a unprofessional actor. But when I saw the complete movie, I realized how great he is. I would love see he next film. Thumbs up for dhanush.
Dhanush u r smthng special man... i luv ur 3 movie n raanjhanaa....
Shallow bitch! -__-
youtube.com/watch?v=XyLnPjA0mYU
You are a muslim yourself.. why do you refer them as &#39;Idiot&#39; Khan&#39;s ? just wondering !!
cant wait to watch this .
Can this boy from South make the grade in the fiercely competitive Hindi filmdom where a he-man image is very much necessary?
Very good
Pakistan banned the movie because........
very good until interval than after  very worsttttt

trust me your missing out
Havent watched it but looks like a beauutifull film..bless xx
I identify with Kundan because I feel I&#39;ve been Kundan for someone, that someone who walked all over my heart and never returned back the undying love I had for him.Years may go by but love and intensity is the same.Do I regret loving him? No, I don&#39;t.It&#39;s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. It takes guts to do what Kundan did.Self destructive love is lethal.I chose silence. &quot; Tujhko ruswaa na kiya khud bhi pashemaan na huye,ishq ki rasm ko iss tarah nibhaya humne&quot;
I watched ashiqui 2 and YJHD but after watching Raanjhanaa I feel I&#39;m stuck on this movie.I&#39;ve already watched it 3 times.What brings me and others back to Raanjhanaa is his undying true love for his lady who doesn&#39;t reciprocate in the same way.He still worships her despite her refusal to acknowledge his love.He is so attached to her that he&#39;s willing to leave his people behind and die for her.He says &quot; Zoya tum jahan bhejogi hum jayenge aur bholenath ki kasam wahan se bhi jeet ke ayenge &quot; 
I was reading Anand L Rai&#39;s interview the other day. He said &quot; ab koi shayar nahi banta kyunki log ab sachcha pyar nahi karte, log dil tutne se,pyar ke dard se aur taklefon se darte hain.Unka pyar mein padna,kisi se rishte banaana aur fir badi aasani se dur chale jana,rishta tutne ke baad itni jaldi sambhal jana kaise sambhav ho pata hai&quot;. I totally agree with him.The likes of &quot; Kundan &quot; are a dying breed.We all wish for someone to love us with so much dedication but we&#39;re afraid do to the same.
It&#39;s a music piece composed by Rahman which was used in various scenes in the movie as background music.It&#39;s not a full fledged song with lyrics.
what is the name of a song played in 0:27 anyone please reply..

Dont Get me wrong But sequel will surely spoil nd insult  this awsome movie with nice ending...
Dhanush proved it yet again and now to Bollywood that color and size just dont matter, all that matters is the passion for acting and talent !!!
Oye hoye , kudiye ......... shakal bhi changi tan gallan hor bhi vadhiya ! Very Nice .
fantastic movie....loved it ...after many years one of the best movie 
Declared smash hit....still doing good biz, domestic and overseas (source: wikipedia)...point is...people appreciate good cinema....if ur too into skin colour....there&#39;s hollywood for you...ufff even there also u will find problem with amazing black talented actors...so mr/miss SNOW WHITE...quit watching films...u will come across fine talents...whom for ur eyes...looks terrible...shallow mind...
 aweeesome movie loved it..... dhanush keep  intact entirely in the movie  BETTER THAN AASHIQUI2  simply great dhanush . I have watched the film 3 times and every time it grooves u on its music

Anyone have this movie with english subtitle?

Thank You so much for this wonderuflll film......... 
Kundan , Zoya , Murari , Bindiya....feels like part our life......
So much emotionally attached with this movieeeeeeeeee
and i didn&#39;t get how Abhay Deol died in the movie..... i thought he was recovered before brought back to his home? 
HOLY GRAIL tht was an awesome movie.....just watched yesterday....Bollywood needs to make this kind of movies...loved tht part when he says &#39;&#39;U FORGET ME&#39; @ 2:46 and then he went home to find out wht tht actually means....Abhay Deol&#39;s part was awesome too...another actor with very intelligent acting skill......10/10 movie overall....
not much of a dhanush fan BUT have become one after i watched this movie ....this guy and his friends character  have done well to make this movie watchable more than once
dhanush rocks
I Watched Raanjhanaa From---------&gt; bit.ly/watchraan?ve
852 dislikes ?? Huh! All of them from asshique 2 fans..
i did not like the movie....  so what.. i have the right to opinion... do not behave like a illiterate uneducated stubborn idiot who wants people to think the way he thinks... or gaali de ke apna level mat dikha .. 
This movie was much better then most movies that I saw in 2012 or 2013.. Danush seriously needs to recieve a best actor award for this movie.
Don&#39;t see this movie made by namerd
I m a huge Dhanush fan, but guys please stop comparing this film with Salman&#39;s film.. unnecessarily Salman fans will start bashing at Dhanush.. it is normal whenever he is compared with some other star, that star&#39;s fans gets protective over their star and start bashing at Dhanush instead of being neutral.. so lets just enjoy his success and not compare him with any other stars.. 
hi. wher to get the song from 0:26 to 0:38. Thanks
guys can anyone translate whats happening on this video clip ? looks like Anand Rai and Dhanush are having some misunderstanding.. but I dont know hindi, so not very sure.. if someone can translate, that is much appreciated.. thanks in advance.

/watch?v=dQ7gxLKYykc
haters can go and watch some salgand movies
I Watched Raanjhanaa Full Movie From--------&gt; bit.ly/watchraan?vidi
ATTENTION JUST TO CLEAR OUT A MISCONCEPTION OF THE STORY THAT WHEN ZOYA CONFESSES HER FAKE LOVE TO KUNDAN THE REASON HE DOESNT GET THAT HAPPY WHEN ZOYA SAYS SHE LOVES HIM IS BECAUSE IN THAT SAME MORNING OF THAT DAY EVEN BEFORE ZOYA CONFESSES HER FAKE LOVE TOWARSD HIM KUNDAN ALREADY KNOWS THAT SHE WANTS HIM KILLED AS THE INSPECTOR HAD INFORMED KUNDAN ALREADY THAT THERE WILL BE A BOMB IN THE RALLY TODAY.
stupid movie! 
thats not a song but just a small music piece that comes a couple of times in the film, A.R Rahman at its best :)
anyone know the name of the song starting from 0:25???
please translate to turkish subtitle, ─▒ want to watch so much... please

Bollywood ka naam badnaam kr ra h ye movie
Chutiye log ko bs psns aata h esa movie
watch south movies, esp malayalam movies if you want to know what acting is all about. bollywood is all about glamour.
great movie first half is excellent and dhanush acting is marvellous new star of the bollywood all the bollywood top stars be ready for the new competition my hero is coming abhay is also looking great and we can see improvement in sonam too .a must watch film.

leave it wat u will get from sonam or sonakshi. just think abt me and MY ...
true love story 

 
i saw this yesterday and was very surprised by how good this movie was,  danush did an excellent job 
I happen to be a non-Indian who enjoys watching Bollywood films. Before this movie I did not know who this Dhanush guy was and then I did a little bit o research and found out more about him. I have to say after watching this film he gained a new fan. I love this guy and I do not think he is ugly at all. He&#39;s very handsome with a face so refreshing that is needed in B.wood. I&#39;m kinda getting tired at this so called &quot;good looking actor&quot;. B.wood needs more of Dhanush. He&#39;s absolutely great! :)
Chutiya movie chutiye log ko bs psnd aayega mera 150 rp wapas kro mai ni janta
very good movie and songs are also awesome
Sale ko acting b kha aati
aat movie aa

Donkeys...Pl undersstand...U pay not for looks but  for acting..Those who want looks of hero,,they can see the picture sitting  in house...Not required to go to cinema hall.

If u want to love so please love like dhanush.heart touch film
Fantastic movie.truely mind blowing
Mere ghr me jo naali saaf krta h wo b isse acha dikhta h
Bekar movie h koi mat dekhna.itbi bore movie aaj tk ni dekha.acting to kisi ko ni aati na. Hi sonam ko aur na hi pagal se dhanush ko..theater me nind b ni aayegi iska chahra dekh k
I Watched Raanjhanaa From----------&gt; bit.ly/watchraan?jhanaa
dhanush was wow but sonam........... shuld hav been shruti hassan in her place...
Bindassss love
the best picture of the year so far.........
ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION SONAM KAPOOR INSULTS SONAKSHI FOR BEING THE FIRST CHOICE OF RAANJHANAA, JUST TYPE ON YOUTUBE &quot;SONAM KAPOOR INSULTS SONAKSHI SINHA&quot;
I watched ranjhana for just Dhanush and gonna watch it infinite times.Dhanush&#39;s acting was superb  for sure...&lt;3 &lt;3
to the small percentage who keep talking about his looks.. he is always going to carry on acting tamil films..   always on screen as our tamil superstar :)  waiting for maryan* 
The current breed of actors in bollywood is nowhere close to potential of dhanush.he lacks looks ok but he can make u laugh,cry,and fall in love with him by his acting which the newbie&#39;s cant do.
superb movie,before this film the only time i saw dhanush&#39;s acting was in pudhupettai(tamil film) and trust me he was mind-blowing in that film...i guess he should do more hindi films,bollywood at present have only few good actors like aamir,irfan,nawazuddin,ranbir etc and now dhanush joins that list....
agree with u....
AR RAHMAN IS JUST AMAZING.......TUM TAK TU MUN SHUDIIIIIII PIYA MILENGE..........Great

i watched Raanjhanaa Hindi Film From-------&gt; bit.ly/watchraan?hindi
k.thanks :-)
k.thanks :-)
you forget me ! mwahhh 

hahahah

Loved Dhanush !Loved the movie! I am gonna go watch it again , finally a movie that&#39;s totally worth it

The first movie  that I saw of Dhanush was 3 and I was amazed by his acting, so when Raanjhanaa&#39;s trailer came out, I was so excited! I never went to watch any Bollywood film in the theatre but I went to watch Raanjhanaa just for Dhanush! And I&#39;m going to watch it again tomorrow. I LOVED this movie :)
A Bilingual movie ( Hindi &amp; Tamil ) was already announced for 2014.. Both Dhanush and Aanand gonna jointly produce the film.. I wish Sonam, Zeeshan (Murari) and Swara (Bindiya) will also act in that movie.. I very much loved all four of the them.. But yesterday Zeeshan has told he is getting many offers to play friend role, but he wanna play more important roles now.. .so not sure whether he will act in the next year&#39;s movie if the role was small, but I think Murari was good role, he played well
Sorry just saw this msg.. hope somebody already cleared ur doubts.. 1. Yes Sonam very much knew Abhay is a Punjabi, she lies to Dhanush that he is a muslim, so that he will convince her dad to let her marry Abhay, Sonam uses Dhanush like a puppy for her selfish needs (like Dhanush uses Swara).. 2. Dhanush was responsible, cause he exposed the true identity of Abhay, so Zoya&#39;s relatives beat him death, so Dhanush feels guilty.. so thats why Sonam was pissed at Dhanush cause he ruined her plan..
Hmmm, second half of the movie was totally unexpected, a very different  story. Enjoyed it!!!
We dont fall in love just because someone is cute, there should be some spark.. which Kundan had for Zoya, which Bindiya had for Kundan.. as per your logic, we should wonder what was Kundan thinking when he had cute Bindiya was all over him :).. 

In a way both Kundan and Zoya are selfish, they both used Bindiya and Kundan respectively for their selfish needs, thats why this movie is a classic, writer projected the lead characters with grey shade, like normal ppl, instead of showing them as GOLD
Super..... Flim
They are doing another film together. It&#39;s official news
search DEEPIKA and RANI MUKHERJEE etc without make up - they are DARK - yet I still think Deepika atleast is still beautiful. Shame on you for judging based on skin colour.
Must watch movie, 
better than yjhd!!

&lt;3 dhanush!!

Dhanush is a really refreshing actor - in my and a lot of my friends - all of us living overseas - think that him and ranbir are the only ones in mainstream bollywood movies that can actually ACT. totally agree with @gurlsrkewl ...are you all supermodels!? I doubt it. and tbh I&#39;m from the north and still think dhanush is pretty cute because of his smile and charismatic acting. SKIN COLOUR DOES NOT EQUATE TO GOOD LOOKS. YOU NEED TO GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASSES! SUCH BACKWARD THINKING!
dhanush tamil movie hit list.puthupattai,pollathavan,padikathavan,mayakkam enna,3,thiruvidaiyadal aarambam,kadhal kondan,kutti,yaradi nee maghini,mappalai,vengai,aadugalam,dhanush fans watch these movies in YouTube or by download
This is the fucking movie at all.I feel really bored I wanted to slapped dhanus.chodu ko ni pta kisne star bna diya kuch ni aata saale ko
Because of their character weakness. They are blind to see what&#39;s inside of a person and will even settle for any white washed tomb. 
(Cont..) Hats off to Himanshu Sharma for writing such a great story/screenplay and to Anand Rai for his direction efforts. Both Dhanush and Sonam displayed brilliant performances. I am expecting several awards for this movie.

I was first skeptical about this movie and thought it was over-hyped. Surprised to find that this movie was playing 4 shows/day in a local theater in the US. Went to check it out last night and was literally stunned after seeing it. Usually there are only very few Hollywood movies that would have houseful occupancy at theaters in the US but this one was houseful and I had to settle for one of the front row seats. (cont...)
nice
Gaand phat gayi...seeyogey!!  LOL!!!
don&#39;t know why people consider dhanush ugly.
he has a manly look with brilliant eyes, and ofcourse his talent makes him more adorable
Nic songs
awesome movie... dhanush  rocks.......

Watch Raanjhanaa Full Movie From XOBUTA DOT COM
yoar r right...! awesome movie

@Aiza Hassan .....&quot;I&#39;m a girl that&#39;s resembles Katrina kaif &quot;....what a load of horse shit.....ppl here weren&#39;t born yesterday....you&#39;re either a ugly bitch or a guy.......
In today&#39;s life where love story are so damn predictable.  This is movie I love to see watch again and again.  Great movie. Don&#39;t really get into movie where I get emotional but this out of the line. I do reckon watch this movie. And plus great music from the music legend itself A.R .R
For those who saying tat he s not talented.....pls watch tis video...... type &quot; 3 movie climax dhanush &quot; in youtube .......and after tat u can  comment here...............

you would marry Dhanush (because, of course, hez a big star) but you would never marry Kundan. Because you know who Kundan is,,,he is just your regular neighbourhood guy, whom u never gave a damn......
I would marry Kundan, he&#39;s super cute.. I don&#39;t know what Zoya was thinking!! :)
watched for the third time in theatres yesterday ..you will love the characters more .. more you watch more you will find out how brilliant dhanush is and the music of A.R. Rahman.. just loved the whole experience of the movie for the third time even more
Guy looks like a good actor.
I&#39;m a girl that&#39;s resembles Katrina kaif and I would marry the character kundan if he had approached me in my life with his looks height colour everything just the depth of love should be real and genuine like kundans, being katrina kaif&#39;s look alike when I don&#39;t have a problem with dhanush&#39;s looks and I believe he is an average good looking guy then what are the people on here on about that he is ugly I think they should go look at themselves in the mirror before commenting on dhanushs looks.
