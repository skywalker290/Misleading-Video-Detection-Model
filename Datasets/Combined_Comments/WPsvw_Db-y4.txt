Hello, I have one question about samsung galaxy phone. I was thinking of buying an s20 ultra this year but s21 ultra is coming soon next year. Is it more worthwhile for me to wait for the s21 or is it more worthwhile for me to buy the s20?
This mobile spec is far more better then my laptop
Ultra
Theirs just no need to get it, computers drive forward because people build gaming pc&#39;s, unless you play games on a phone their is just no need to get something with those specs, takes nice pictures, surf web decent speed, good UI, thats all you really need on a phone.
Samsung used to be a market leading phone until they decided to give inferior chipset in European market now even the cheap Chinese phones are better than them.
Out of all the videos I‚Äôve watched, this is definitely one of them
HA HA, funny start !
S20 ultra is a technology made for Indian aunty for snooping around the neighbourhood
He stills calls it mkbhd
Nammude mammokkayude aduthulla phone Alle ith
I really appreciate this guy, he makes things easy to understand for those of us that don&#39;t know a lot about tech lingo, but still makes it clear what the product is and what it can do
Damn, no phone is big in your hands.
Let me guess: he loves it?
PLUS
Budget
MKBHD elaborate please...
Now samsung has no more thing to add to the camera other than microscope<br><br>letsss goooo!!!
not too long ago (2015) flagship phone only cost 500-600, and then Apple sell iPhone X for $999, in the future, if Apple sell their phone for $19,999 samsung be like &quot;Our Galaxy S70 Max Ultra Only Cost $24,999&quot;
The s20 comes with the glass protector!
I bought the s20 ultra
Would anyone else like a phone without a slick/smooth back? Like a sticky side so you didn&#39;t feel like it would slip out of your hands!
These are getting more expensive by the year
S20 just does sub 6
Apple will have this tech in 4yrs and rename it some pompous ass libtard fence riding we discovered it 1st name. <br>PS: I am team apple.
Just got my s20 ultra, first samsung phone i use after 6yrs of iPhone. Jumped from iPhone 8 to this one! Cant compare the phones but the s20 ultra is the best phone I ever used! Love it
Imagine this phone the same form factor only smaller with the same camera but with zero bump and the camera is in the center instead of being in the corner, the camera is behind the glass. That would be a piece of art. The only thing that is stopping so many people from buying this phone is the size and the large camera bump on the back, otherwise the phone is excellent
And he still uses an iphone
Who saw Supersaf camera tst S20U vs P40 Pro+ where S20 Ultra had faster focus
yeah so the S10 Series and Note 10 and S20(+) are better, because they have a normal 12 mpx cam, each Pixel is bigger and can Catch more Light: This is why iPhones e.g and Galaxys(before S20U) have such good Video footage! But 48mpx and all above doesn&#39;t make sense, it makes everything even worse!!! So Pixel Binning is a crime!
I&#39;ve got the UK exynos S20 standard but it feels slower than my old S10 except the 120hz when it works and doesn&#39;t slow down. What can I do to make this feel as fast as it should be and stop it slowing down frames automatically? I&#39;ve tried setting it to optimised and high performance mode. I&#39;ve tried disabling animations and 0.5 in dev options. I&#39;ve tried 120hz at 720p and 60hz 720p. I&#39;ve tried medium power saving mode lol. Can anyone help? Thanks!
What a beast of a phone! Makes me re-consider my iPhone..
Bruh the RAM is massive
Can we print true 108mp photos?
This is the best phone I&#39;ve had in years!!!!<br>The only real competitor too me was my old lg stylo 3 wich was trash
With Ultra, I can really get UFO sightings as clear as possible.
s20+ and s20 Ultra are compatible with Mmwave 5G
You have become a &quot;pro&#39; Apple customer, I can see biasness in your reviews, you &#39;re just elongating the analysis of the phones, discussing minor flaws all the way (rather being general in reviewing things, you discuss how and to what extend you don&#39;t like a particular thing (we like to know those imperfections but not a whole video about it). Do justice with every piece of tech and please stop being cocky to every phone out there, make reviews in the perspective of a common user. peace!
Another giveaway bro üòä
I wonder when we are gonna get to the stage where you - as an average person - cannot afford a regular phone anymore because they all need to be super fancy which you basically don&#39;t need.

hey guys .<br>please help me grow my chanel and subscribe.<br>Budowlaniec w Anglii
does any body know how can we screen video from a samsung like screenshot but video...? i used to have this option in my iPhone but dunno how to do it in samsung...
the s20 ultra seemed great on paper but has too many issues. Exynos variants have garbage battery life, and even snapdragon version still lag behind the 11 pro max. The 8k recording is practically useless, and the video recording is once again behind apple in terms of quality. The 100x zoom is terrible at high powers and the fingerprint unlock is again slower than apples. As with samsung, only decent thing was the screen
Need your advice should I buy galaxy Note 10 plus  or galaxy s20 ultra.
üíì
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsvw_Db-y4&amp;t=89">1:29</a> it‚Äôs kinda ironic that the app he‚Äôs looking at is plague inc.
I think the S20 Plus is the better deal, and I don&#39;t think the Ultra brings anything desirable to the table except the 10x zoom. The S20 Ultra camera focus system is Phase Detection AutoFocus,  which is slower and less reliable than the full sensor Dual Pixel AutoFocus on the S20 and S20 Plus, and does not work as well with moving objects.<br>100x zoom is just a novelty due to the useless photo quality, and the S20 moon shots can be beaten by holding a $15 plastic telescope up to a regular phone.
FACT : if you rub the S20 Ultra , four times really hard it expands to the Samsung Wall MicroLED TV a whopping 292 inches !
Does the phone have headphone jack?
P30 pro: u can see the moon. S20 ultra responds: u can see a person on a moon. 10 years later: p140pro : you can see mars. S100 ultra: u can see the volcanos on mars. Iphone 21 pro max ultra s: hold my 2x optical zoom.
Who is watching in Süòã20
Deep down you know you don‚Äôt really need this phone. Unnecessarily extra on sheet and practically you won‚Äôt be using as much spec as it has.
The Best tech Youtuber....
Hey Thanks for your video. I have three queries to you as I gonna buy a new device. Its very important to me....<br>1. Do you think Ultra&#39;s auto focus  can be fixed by software update? or its hardware issue? if it is hardware then whats the fate of this device?<br>2. Does s20+ have same issue? <br>3. Whats the difference between Note 10 + camera module and s20 Ultra / s20+ camera module? Thanks
Watching  on my Ultraü§ë
Tech2
Buying a phone + a portable camera  still less $$$ than an S20 Ultra... Thats sad!
actually, I planned to buy the note 20 ultra when it&#39;ll be released but there are two reasons for me to be scared:<br>A. if the s20 ultra is priced at 1399$ minimum, the note version will be at least 1549$.<br>B. samsung&#39;s 1399$ pricing reminds me of pewdiepie&#39;s 399$
R.I.P.          BROOOOOO!!!!!!!!
120hz only on 1080, why doesn&#39;t he mention that
Samsung is shit

I dont understand why there is need of 12/16 gb ram on a phone ??
quick everyone.. isis is stood next to him whispering coronavirus in the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsvw_Db-y4&amp;t=97">1:37</a> forcing him film this video, save mkbhd..

12 to 16 gigs of ram <br>Meanwhile my computer is struggling with 4 gigs of ram
I just canceled my s20+ 5G due to stronger frequencies. Any phones that have 5G causes cancer. I&#39;ll stick with 4G for now even though it&#39;s still harmful, but lesser than 5G.
It is absolutely no different then my g4 that I had last week..absolutely no difference..I still get no reception in my areas that I had g4..its all bullshit..I&#39;m no better off from g4..now that I went to g5..its all bullshit
No more smaller sizes? Like S10e?
Sorry to tell you. U are wrong about the 108mp camera makes a big difference. And the price is worth it..
Ok but why do I need to an 8k camera and  16 gigs of ram üêè for calling and scrolling through a site??
Someone needs to do a video on a pro mode camera test. I would love to see how far the raw photos can be pushed with a little post work.
You‚Äôre holding the phone over a high place. Makes me nervous
That phone is more powerful than my laptop sheesh lol
Samsung: 100X Zoom<br>Apple: <b>1000X</b> Zoom

Does the sd version work in europe?
I get the feeling Marques got tired of all the superlative high numbers being quoted, like, this seems a bit overwhelming and like some kind of marketing gimmick but here I am saying what they wanted me to say.
People  photography really did change actually
Man no 1tb internal storage on the Galaxy S20 Ultra damn but hey 512gb works too
Wtf 6.9 inches what the heck Samsung and 240hz woah
Samsung did what Apple did finally and bumped the price so high let&#39;s go
Ahaha S20 Ultra ad on S20 Ultra video üòÄ
I don&#39;t care if it jerks you off too, I&#39;m not paying $1400 for a smartphone
I might stick with my note 8. Lol first time not feeling that my phone is outdated after more than 2 years
How do you maintain NOT having any ads on your videos?? Please give @GrahamStephan some of those tips ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Samsung is ass and is for poor people
this phone is definitely required to ... show you can afford it.
After ƒ± lost a lot of earbuds and I discover this Bracelet earbuds and newer lost it recommend it to everyone     @t

It would be great to see a video on Vivo Apex 2020!!
Smh hear how u go in hard on all the specs like this is the only phone...the lg way better
Shit just listening to u talk about this phone and how u try play off all the shit about this phone jus show me u guys most be getting payed from samsung cause i see the cam bump and that shitty zoom and u play it off like its ok but make it was a LG phone and i know u would make it look like its the worse phone ever
I was gonna get the ultra but now I don‚Äôt think so.  I just can‚Äôt justify dropping that many greenbacks on a device.  I‚Äôll stick with my s10 another year.  The cost just took the fun out of it.
I got a Samsung j3 $50. $1,400 u can buy a beater car ü§îü§îüòÇüòÇ 4 dat price
Future : You will have many pre installed cameras in tourist places, Just connect to it and take a high resolution picture from your mobile. No more 50-100 megapixel camera&#39;s
$1400... It&#39;s only a matter of the only the rich can afford these phones
12 Gigs of RAM is already a lot. Now they wanna bump it up to 16. 8 gigs is enough for a phone. But it&#39;s fine either way.
Amateur porn is gonna look insane with these cameras.
My mind is into the Ultra, my wallet is into the s8.
Look at stars with the phone it&#39;s the best to show people the true about the stars so yet
I&#39;m not an apple fan but in my opinion iphone is the best phone at the moment and a long time from here on, we have to be realistic samsung has been and will always be under apple can not compare. The best performance the best camera , the best software optimized. The only thing that is currently a &#39;&#39;plus&#39;&#39; for the samsung is the &#39;&#39;zoom camera&#39;&#39; which is a crap, a marketing thing, totally useless. Don&#39;t waste your money on the s20. If you have the money to buy the s20 ultra do not buy it is the biggest mistake. Buy iphone 11 pro or pro max which is even cheaper and much better than s20 ultra. I am not paid by anyone to say this but this is the truth.
Z flip
I sold my winning iphone 11. because if i can get my need in about 200 dollars then why to showoff
On the real, if you work at a certain hardware and lumber store... you can save up to $400 on the S20 Ultra and Galaxy buds+...
How not to like YouTubers in 2020! <br><br>I still don&#39;t get why so much criticism on Samsung and the whole Android phones? <br><br>If it was Apple with 108 megapixel zoom, Youtubers will make it like the best thing in the world and say go with Apple.<br><br>I am really impressed with Samsung this year, the price is high, but they have a reason why is so high. <br>The best thing is that the price of s10 will dropüòçüëçüëç
I saw you try to swipe back like it is on iOS. I‚Äôve had an Android for 2 days and that‚Äôs my biggest issue so far
Apple gang round hea cuhhüòÇüòÇ
Apple:We skipped number nine<br><br>Samsung:Well we skipped 9 numbers<br><br><br><br><br>Huawei:Lol we skip 10 numbers every year
It‚Äôs time to face the obvious facts, that<br> phones have nothing new to offer anymore except better cameras. My best advice to you is pay off your phone and keep it as long as you can.
While Samsung makes good smartphones, knowing they don&#39;t support my two year old Note 8 (for $1000) by not giving it Android 10, I will not be buying another Samsung device again.<br><br>Next phone:<br>Pixel 5<br>or<br>iPhone 12 Pro Max Plus Minus Equals
Best smartphone
Korian and Chinies products are just crap and garbige
Samsung: Because We Can
win s20 pro or ultra from Mrwhosetheboss<br><br> @t
Still the base model iPhone X costs more than this in India
What do you think would be for the Note Series. Maybe just add the S Pen to that phone
all I want from a phone is to make phone calls.ü§™
My brain for samsung s20 ultra <br>My heart is also for samsung s20 ultra <br><br><br><br>But my budget is for samsung A10 <br>üëéüëéüëéüëé
I&#39;ll wait till price drop
With the design of the camera and the bump, it looks like an iphone design, ugly and samsung looks like going back in time rather than moving on to future. I dont like it.
The way you talk about any other phones or gadget... You seems familiar to so called Apple&#39;Fanboy&#39;. ü§ôüèΩ
I didn‚Äôt go watch the S20 video lol
SMH now people are bragging over zooming rights..... zooming...
Are you checking Sony Xperia 1 MKll???
That 16GB is much needed for GoPro 360 processing. My S9 is burning up from the heavy load of processing.
Watching a preview of a phone I will never have, ok I&#39;m done...
This phone price covers alot of my stuff for 6 month
Question do you think the new Note 10 is going to top this phone when it comes out in October

What is the minimum focal length for rear camera? Will the hybrid zoom work well for macro shots?
I will buy this phone 2022 300 $
Waste of time a 120 hz phone review on 30 fps v√≠deo.
You Can use the 10x zooms to spy on people. Imagine if a paedophile get a hand on this device.
I feel bad for spending so much money on this phone. And I&#39;m upgrading from a galaxy s8
I though the s20+ also had mmWave....
Wow I love cool phones but, me still using my Tecno Y2
2020: felt like my s10 is old<br>2021: felt like my s20 ultra outdated<br>Me using s8 &#39;)
iPhone is officially dead. Unless they come out with OLED screens, there&#39;s no way Apple can beat Samsung.
For sure the ultra, I can care less about the other two basic models. Go big or go home.
Neither. They fooled us with the note10+ giving us an already outdated speced phone for the price we paid for it. This was a huge insult to us note loyal customers. Thanks but never buy Samsung again.
I wish to have one of your reviewed phones as a gift to my sonüò•
Why TF do you need 12 or 16 gigs of RAM on a phone?? My gaming laptop runs on 16
I&#39;m so torn between getting this phone or wait for the iphone 12 :( What should I do?!
I think S20+ is practical if you want the best high-end phone. It has the same specs as the Ultra except for the 108mp and battery.
2030 - phone can zoom up to mars, so that you can see what elon musk doin...
Expecting a review of sony Xperia 1 mark2
Still has those home keys, wish they had the swipe up like BB10 or iOS.
watching this on my iphone 8
Please review the Sony Xperia 1 Mark ii...And compared it with other <br>flagships
Oh yes, the useless phone
Ultra
Can you please do a review of the CAT phones?
I think you said the s20+ does not have 5g UWB, which is false. The s20 is the only s20 series phone without 5gUWB
Prefer the Ultra
I will definitely go for the s20+ .... the ultra is just too much and I am a power user so I will run that phone thru hell üòÇ
Disapoointed you didnt do any side by side pictures.
Just ordered the ultra, and going by camera tests that are now starting to come out, this setup is amazing and the others for now have been left in the dust.
My mom going on a air plane I am grounded playing on my ps4 my mom  takes  out her Samsung 20 ultra a and uses the 100 zoom camera and see me on my play station and then she messages telling  you grounded form longer amount of time when I get back home
Most expensive thing I&#39;ve ever bought... God, what have I done. This is a terribly mistake I&#39;ve made.

I am at an age now where I wish smartphone manufacturers would make cameras worse again.
Is the &quot;screen protector&quot; the Ultra comes with out of the box, worth keeping on it? Or just replace it right away with something else?
Please do a review on the new Xperia 1 Mark 2
is it possible to zoom in and out with the frontcam ?
What will they do next year? 32GB RAM? It&#39;s insane. I don&#39;t think beyond 4GB or 6GB it makes any difference.
Iphone 11 pro max is better option rather than this tablet sized shit styled camera smartphone.<br><br>If you can use this s20 utlra with just one hand I will purchase it right away!
Best phone ever ,I need for my job ,plus it will pay for it self I need that quality of pictures for my reports and get paid ,my galaxy 9 does great but the newr the better
So what is everyone  doing for the micro sd card.
1 weak late
for 108mp the difference is disappointing, its only about 10% visibly better
In one year that s20 will priced as same as the iPhone XS Max üòÇüòÇ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsvw_Db-y4&amp;t=90">1:30</a> Shit this isn&#39;t iPhone, where&#39;s the &#39;go back&#39; button?

So I guess nobody went to see the S20 impressions video
It should&#39;ve been a 6000mah.
the best one in reviews ‚ô•Ô∏è
I did not see the intro song. which one is it?
Ok
Ultra  is what I&#39;m interested in
Please hurry with the review! Lol I wanna upgrade my Note 8 but stuck between note 10 and s20 help me :(
I got something else that‚Äôs 7‚Äù in my pocket üòâ
Samsung only has one thing left to work on, the speakers. Having ok speakers is great but for 1500 dollars all we are paying for is the camera. That&#39;s kind of insane
Not joking I&#39;m still using a moto x2 which has 16GB ROM. LOL!!!
So it&#39;s almost as good as the ROG2 for twice the money.. only thing that&#39;s really better is the updated Snapdragon, screen res and the crazy camera.<br><br>I still prefer ROG.. just looks better overall and isn&#39;t as much as a full gaming rig PC lol. But I do want that zoom.
Laptops be like , am I a joke to you
When are you doing a give away, cause that&#39;s pretty much how am ever gonna be able to afford such a phoneüò´ üòûüòî
I&#39;ve already &quot;SUBSCIBED&quot;  Marques :P
I think the S20 Ultra will suit Joe Goldberg
It so funny how scummy people are against Apple, everybody was calling Iphone 11 pro/pro max ugly and shit because of its camera but now nobody doesnt mind camera on samsung which is 10x times uglier
MkbkdÂ∏ÖÁöÑ‰∏ÄÁ¨î
I bet Samsung DeX with that 16gb of ram will actually have enough juice to give people a good experience
Apple watches the video üòõ
Samsung is going to price itself out of the market.  I, for one, will never pay more than $600 for a smartphone!
&quot;ultra&quot; but still no headphone jack :&#39;(
I would go to non of new Samsung phones, but OnePlus...
Camera review?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsvw_Db-y4&amp;t=331">5:31</a> Alright time to climb a tree and take some photos of my neighbor üòÇü§£üòÇ
They Make fun of apple and copy apple. (Camera)
The specs sounds more like a decktop PC
I can officially say that person who give 1400$ for phone is an idiot...
Marques, I know it has single shot for capturing 10 seconds from each camera and photos but can you record just video from all cameras like you can in Filmic Pro on the iPhone 11? Also, what do you think of the stills you can capture from 8k footage?
ÂÅ∑Á™•Á•ûÂ•á
Image pointing the 100 x zoom at the sun or sky when planes are flying by lmao
Already preordered..gray 128
apple is out
now we waiting for canon and nikon to turn into mobiles.
Imagine how much MB that&#39;s gonna take for a 108MP Image.
Samsung: Its over Apple, I have the high ground<br><br>Apple: You underestimate my power! <br><br>Samsung: Don&#39;t try it.
108MP?? I really want to know about that sensor size though. There&#39;s nothing weird for a Hasselblad camera to have those many MP because they have the bodies to hold medium format sensors. But, a phone?? Something seems fishy here.
The S20+ also supports both 5G mm wave and sub 6 according to Samsung rep I spoke to today.
Halo guys David di sini dan ini adalah Samsung S20 Ultra
When a smartphone beats your computer in ram and storage size
Well since the note 10 got best camera, this is pretty much the note with a 108 mp camera, so yes it makes it the best
I just got the 7T Pro 5G McLaren damn now I want this lol
as i wondered maybe like everyone else how do these people get the new phones even before they are released to do videos on Samsung get me in on the game so i can do reviews on new products
Camera bump. Canada bump.
i preordered the s20 ultra black reading all comments and going thru all the youtube vids and getting well versed with the phone even before i get it so i can make my own video and unboxing when I get mine as im in Canada i paid ALOT more for my phone ü§ëüòÄüôÉü§ëüòÄ
So you&#39;re pretty much buying a $1400 camera.
Yes but no headphone jack
i remember holding my samsung galaxy note 2 with 16 gigs of storage
With this phone I guess you can peep at someone‚Äôs destiny
2020 samsung üíìüíìüíìüíì
I want all these specs... but not such a big screen
where can i buy it?
thanks
Oled display???<br>dynamic amoled
Should of used the phone to record this video, that would been awesome
If Samsung would guarantee three years of firmware updates, I‚Äôd buy the Ultra.
Then shoot in 60fps!
The S20 Ultra is by far the most beautiful and superior.  I&#39;m totally in love and wish it had an sPen...and yes seriously an sPen.  I&#39;m a Note series person, but the S20 Ultra is quite tempting and has me wondering what the note 20 plus/ultra will be like lolü§îü§îü§î
Does 120hz only work at 1080p on the ultra as well?
Apple could sell a potato for 2000 dollars and people would still buy it
I pre-ordered the S20 Ultra. Go big or go home.
What&#39;s the BGM of start
Ultra.. I&#39;m very intersted
Lol I can&#39;t wait to see what Note 20 Pro Ultra+ is gonna look like on paper.
Can I use it instead of a 100x microscope.
Can you compare it to the Oneplus 7T pro mclaren.
I guess this will be the most wanted phone of 2020
Start at 999? I&#39;d better get an iPhone 11
We are waiting for the ultra as I loved it and for the specs it provides it is future proofed too so what more do we need
Sorry I didn‚Äôt switch to the other video.  I‚Äôm lazy.
display - 6.9 inch<br><i>nice</i>
intro music at its best again
&quot;S20 Ultra starting at $1399&quot;<br>Apple: Wait, that&#39;s illegal
I&#39;ll stick with the S10 + for another 3 or 4 years. Epic phone. No new innovation here
So I still have the note 9, I decided not to upgrade to the Note 10 plus primarily because I felt that it wasnt that much of a upgrade. But I just preordered the s20 and I love every feature of it. The s-pen is the only thing I&#39;m losing but I never used it anyway. <br><br>My question to you is do you think that the s20 will be a good choice? Since the note 9 is still such a great phone
Camera is crazy... and ugly
My galaxy s10 plus is absolutely still amazing for me.
No matter how bigger space it will be difinetly shortage of space in future I mean when you taking lot of picture and video coz it has 108 mp resolution.  Samsung never make a new unique mobile phone.  It similar like Google pixel 4 or iPhone pro or something.  They just copy other&#39;s  idea and they try to make new phone. Sorry to say that.
I am a die hard Samsung customer but they are getting crazy with these prices.
Iphone &quot; bbbut we have emoji&quot;
Most interested in the ultra, but probably going to upgrade to the s20 plus model from the s8+
This phone is insane.

It doesn&#39;t convince me to upgrade my S10+
Instead of making &quot;smaller&quot; versions of their flagship devices (e, s or c), the normal ones are now the cut down.
Do you guys think they will make a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
Its crazy how galaxy just said fuck it lets make the best phone in history
My favorite was the S5. I have the S10 now. Let me check out this video.
Flossy Carter&quot; S20 is a Certified Beast&quot;.
Can we see Galaxy S20 Ultra vs Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro
Do you all know it&#39;s not exactly a 108 MP AND NOT EVEN AN ACTUAL 10x zoom??
imagine spending over $1399 for a phone running android ü•¥

Whi spotted the neomorphism logo intro?
I was gonna get the note 10 + but I think I just changed my mind
This phone has 16gb RAM and 512 gb ROM, while my laptop has 4 gb RAM and 320 gb Hardisk. üòâ üòÅ
I&#39;m happy with my galaxy s4
I think 100x optical zoom story is a hoax.<br>There are various parameters like white balance, saturation level,colour gamut, sharpness and above all size of image processing sensors which has to be very carefully looked at before designing a mega optical zoom.
Me: thinks my 16 megapixel camera is good<br>Marques: 108 megapixels
The dislikes on this video are from people without souls.
Missing the side curves on s20
I want that üò≠üò≠üò≠
Really we need 100 pixel camera in phone?  An ugly looking camera bump up..I don&#39;t see any AI features in this mobile...why people spending huge money on mobile?  Just for camera and 5g features spending $$$$$?
It&#39;s ok I guess.
its so fat phone
MB always hatin on Samsung, headed back to Lou peace
haha i didnt go watch the other video
My computer only has 8 GB of ram..
10 Years from now we&#39;re all going to be looking back at how ugly that huge camera is.
108 megapixels but shitty photos just like the iphone 11.  You CAN&#39;T HAVE GREAT PHOTOS WITH A SENSOR THE SIZE OF A CONFETTI.  Just don&#39;t listen to this commercial shit, and buy a Ricoh GR if you want a real quality camera in your pocket.

This phone is definitely for the perverts and peeping toms lol
I just want my headphone jack
I still have my S8 and while I really like it, I was over the curved screen reeeal quick üôÑ and I also don&#39;t want to upgrade because of the missing headphone jack, ever increasing prices, ugly notches or cameras directly on the screen (instead of being hidden in the bezel) and the removal of expandable memory to force me to buy a higher gb phone.
I just got the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G then they release this jesus.
Did he really think that we skip this vid to watch s10 vid!
Still not a fan of a front-facing camera cutout.

Samsung with the Galaxy S20 Ultra just founded the Stalkers Club. lol

I&#39;m ready to pre-order the Ultra, trading in my Note 10 Plus. I like the 5G speed I&#39;m getting on my OnePlus 7T 5G McLaren and I can&#39;t wait to see this massive 6.9&quot; screen!
or you could get a nice s6 or s7 and an amazing camera for photos
When people expected for s11, Samsung Made s20 :D
I am going for the S20+ because I think after awhile with having the ultra that HUGE camera bump will start to annoy the heck out of me but this is making me leave my pixel to retire
People need to stop throwing money at flagships. $1400 for a phone that will be topped in a year is stupid. <br><br>At this point smart phones are commodities. The flagships dont actually net you anything than luxury and brand. <br><br>Mind you, you can buy a used S9 for sub $200 pretty easily.
Why the fuck arent your videos doing 60fps?
Just give a thicker phone and remove the camera bumps? Could have been a 6000 amp battery they are already so thin k with a case sure it would be way to thick but not every one is so unlucky or stupid to drop his phone
I hope you do a giveaway, with my wedding coming up my wife to be will only let me get this phone if I win it üòÇ

Yo I&#39;m just going to wait until 2022 until the s20 ultra is being sold for $700
Man the audio in this is satisfying.
These prices are just ridiculous
This phone has more RAM than NASA had on all the Apollo missons combined...<br>Its storage is also triple the storage the Soyuz missions had available until the breakup of the Soviet Union...

My only issue is for 1399 you have to provide more than 3 years of slow software updates. It&#39;s ludicrous at this point to think otherwise! -still want the phone though
Pretty much $1,000 of camera and $400 of actual phone. This is made for women who spent their lives taking pictures of themselves and their meals.

Lens is irrelevant. It‚Äôs the sensor that creates the quality and phones can only accommodate a teeny tiny sensor.
So looks like samsung completed the oven range
Razer phone 2 had that display 1-2 years before the samsung s20 ultra!<br><br>(Watching on my razer phone 2)
Honestly the only thing I&#39;m pissed about is the MASSIVE phone size.<br>I wish the S20 Ultra came in a 6.1 inch size or 5.9, my current S9+ is already hard to use with one hand.<br>I wish phones were more small-hand friendly, shit fucking sucks.
Used to be something called a 7&quot; laptop...
This one run AUTOCAD or ARCHICAD ?! Or maybe CATIA ?  LOL
I&#39;m not coming back!
I got mines pre-ordered through an upgrade program so I&#39;m getting the phone for like ¬£800 because I can trade in my Samsung S9+ to get a ¬£100 discount + the extra ¬£200 O2 is giving me and the phone is like ¬£1,200 here in the UK.
Everytime a galaxy comes out :<br><br>This is the best display ever
Maybe the phone should be called the &quot;S20 Ultra Flex&quot;
I&#39;m still running my galaxy s8, but shes getting slow and the battery drains faster these days. <br><br>Eyeing the s20+ probs keep it 4g too
Sounds and looks awesome, can&#39;t wait for it to hit the shelves!!!
Samsung: let&#39;s release a 1399$ phone to all these broke tech enthusiasts. <br>Us geeks that wanna support advancements in technology: well that wasn&#39;t very plus ultra of you
Did NOT watch the other vid
do you think that the s20 ultra will work fine with the osmo 3 gimbal?
@marques: Please upload the Camera Comparison with other flagships!!! This would great help
I have noticed that MKBHD from an impartial assessor had become iPhone fan and Samsung hater. I watch the videos because I hope he would get out of this enchantment but I notice the opposite - the enchantment goes deeper.

I can&#39;t wait to see phone in 10 years from now they are gonna be insane
You could strap on a $8,000 dslr camera to and android and the Snapchat quality will still be the same as an iPhone 3G
This phone can produce 120Hz (40 more than my monitor.)<br>It has almost as much ram as my PC and it has 4k resolution. I might as well run BFV on a phone. Or I should get a super computer

Where&#39;s the health sensor? The pulse oximeter sensor??
Oh, a lot of camera together that looks like it doesn&#39;t make me wanna puke.
I will go from a samsung s8 to the s20+ i think
Im german and that camera can do 5x optical and 10x digital.
Them phone prices have gotten  ridiculously too damn high. 20 years from now people will have to make a decision to buy a new üì± or buy a new üöò.
8k vid when 4k ain&#39;t even mainstream
You get 6.6 million views and the only test you do with the camera which is the highlight of the model is zooming in on a book haha
Should i go for the s20 ultra it the iphone 11pro max? <br>Please reply ü§î
16 GB RAM and all the latest spec..  Well.. Does it have a &#39;Snake&#39; game like my Nokia 3310?
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you do with your periscope&quot; üòÅ
they copied apples camera design
we are now in the land of diminishing returns with phones,    if you have the s9 or the s10 the update will not feel substantial.
Who else actually went and watched the video I clicked on this first because it had 108 megapixels in the title but MKBHD said go and watch the first one so I did and I am glad I did otherwise I probably wouldn&#39;t have understood it properly
Loving my M30s...
Watching this on my iPhone 7. <br>I‚Äôm guud.

What you say about numbers is very true.
I&#39;m still super pleased with my Galaxy A70.. I&#39;m curious what will be out when it starts to fade on me..

I&#39;m going to wait for the final review to make my decision but I definitely need an upgrade.
You haven&#39;t actually used this phone. Everything you&#39;ve just mentioned we can look up. Sorry man but your review was now help. Next time actually try the phone out.
Why 865 and not 855?
Arun&#39;s video on Oppo reno 10x zoom too zoomed to moon. No no samsung, you&#39;re just motivating creepsters who spy!

Pollii sadanam
Samsung has been lazy for a while but man what is the point of this??? Who is this even for? How does this even remotely make my life easier/better for 1400?
The phone looks great but at that price there&#39;s no way.  Phone prices are really getting out of hand.
With all these useless upgrades, we cant even use it to show off over youtube, instagram, facebook, etc coz all photos or videos doesnt support high resolution upload..
No matter how good the hardware is but if they have junk processing   software, camera will still suck!! Biggesr regret is buying s9+ at launch instead of waiting for a couple of months for huawei p30 pro.
hey marques, gime the phone for free
This or Pixel 4 Camera?
Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. how&#39;s the big battery treating?
Is there an &quot;e&quot; version again? I really want a smaller phone and not an iPad mini as you described.
Nice, but no! It&#39;s over kill. However it still looks awesome!
100 times zoom is perfect for stalking lol
Is it a phone or a camera with  a sim option .
Suck next look like note 10 lol are you f*<b>***</b> kidding me Samsung S phones suck
Holy shittttt.....

Why don‚Äôt you understand people. You guys compare latest 2020 flagship work last years iPhone and declare a winner. But them Ô£ø releases their new 2020 iPhone they become king again. Lol sand for other companies hahahahahaah

Why stop at 4 cameras? Just go balls out and make the entire back a camera.

Does it have wireless powershare like the S10 and N10 did?
Unfortunately, Samsung is still married to Android. The only deal-breaker for all Samsung phones in my opinion. If they made their own software and convinced google to let them do it, they would have tremendous changes. Like Iphones, things like SnapChat and the front camera would feel extremely smooth. No matter how good the hardware is, there is always that &quot;Android LAG&quot; that feels disappointing.
Do a comparison vs the Xiaomi Mi 10 pro
Well shit. No more relying on samsung for the best phones while cheap.
Wait... Why 240Hz tho?
S20 Ultra definitely. Unless a better phone comes out from one of the other phone companies.
But can it make a phone call ?

Great video üëç. I&#39;m going for the ultra or the note 20 if they make it. I have an S9 plus so I&#39;m waiting for Android 10 on the Verizon network. By August after the note comes out I will make the decision.
Ugh. This thing is hemorrhaging gimmick after gimmick after gimmick. Samsung doesn‚Äôt care about making the UX awesome. They only care about what their devices look like on paper. It still has a tiny sensor  so 108 megapixels is so useless. All it‚Äôs doing is taking up farrrrrr more memory on your phone. Or forcing you to pay for cloud storage, or buy a ton of extra physical memory for the thing. It isn‚Äôt a well thought out execution and it‚Äôs so obvious. Instead of packing a device to the brim with crap like ram and megapixels they ought to think about how they can make their devices more optimized for a better experience.

It&#39;s a very fast and capable spyware. People should stop for a second and ask why they (big tech companies) need to own so much information from us with such subtle details? We are we willingly giving them the access to own our life by supporting their new &quot;products&quot;
Love it
Apples got some work to do for the iPhone 12
Didn‚Äôt expect this from Samsung,now even they have turned greedy to attract noobs
who the hell is going to film their kids&#39; soccer game in 8K??!!
Samsung:We have 108 megapixels<br>Nokia: 108mp, at $2000, we have 240mp for only $500
$2000,üò£
The camera bump is a üí£
Can&#39;t wait to see how that Space Zoom perform, I&#39;m liking that 40 mg front camera and larger display. Samsung may get that 1399 from me.
Maybe someone will finally find sasquatch.
the phone is good just the colors can be better and the price can be lower
S20+ worth upgrading
Peace ‚úåÔ∏è
I honestly don&#39;t like the way it looks and prefer the standard S20s. The Ultra looks chunky in the wrong places.
I know a way for you to show the refresh rate use a slow mo shot I am pretty sure your red can handle it
Nice Jordans!
Samsung: 16gb ram phone<br>Me: cry in 4gb ram laptop
Still no FaceTime
And everybody said Apple was gonna have soooo many cameras
Samsung Is GOD.
Any only apple users change to android? Considering
Can you still call someone though?
Please can you review the Samsung A71 üôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ
It better take pictures the same resolution of my eyes or im gonna kill somebody
Ultra rules for me but first I need to see que Oneplus 8T McLaren edition
I will take one!<br>You know as well as all of us.. if Apple comes out with the same cameras.. we would be praising it more then you are now.. I have a iPhone XS...if the iOS 12 doesn‚Äôt deliver... I will be going back to Samsung.<br>Mahalo for the video
Cool phone but will be forgotten about because Samsung won‚Äôt update the software after 2022
My gf will need that 100x zoom
You need to get a normal sized hands person to hold this for you.
Damn your hair cut ugly asf
Fuck right off Samsung.
You talk about a mobile like it was a NASA spacial transponder...&amp; you know something? it is not.
I bought my Hyundai elantra 1.6 motor with 13000km on it with zero problems for less than 1300$   in sweden üá∏üá™ , phones are getting really expensive men thats alot of money for a fucking phone that just do the same shit that any other phone since 2015 does. We just keep buying just because of ‚Äú‚Äù yea why not ‚Äú‚Äù . That‚Äôs stupid üôÇ
Am getting this one
They‚Äôre in the 20th already tf
$1400 and no headphone jack and IR blaster. üòí
Does this mean all Samsung users are now gonna have better insta stories or nah?

It&#39;s the LeBron james of phones...<br>A Locomotive coming at you at full speed!!!
Samsung make great phones and always new things add to their phones
6,9 inches<br><br>nice
Samsung: 16gb RAM<br>Me: my phone 16gb storage am ok no big difference ü§îü§îü§£ü§£
They should call it: Quick Flex
Once Samsung realized that customers would pay more than $1.2k they went crazy over the price of Flagship phones.
thanks Apple

Hey Marques, nice one theres. What‚Äôs the name of your wallpaper behind you? Can I get a link to where you got it? Want to get some for my new place. Would appreciate the help. Thanks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsvw_Db-y4&amp;t=303">5:03</a> OMG...
I used to like it when the word to use before ‚Äòpro‚Äô or Ultra‚Äô or whatever was Turbo. Everything was turbo. Even turbo sunglasses lol
100 times zoom to see the aliens
Soon if Samsung keeps on going the way it is we will explore the new galaxies with the phone but I have I phone just because the app and google maps looks too good in it..
This shit sick fham I rather get this not yeo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsvw_Db-y4&amp;t=91">1:31</a> oops it&#39;s Samsung üòÇ‚ù§‚ù§
Awful design
No under display camera, so old tech here. I&#39;ll wait
I&#39;d never thought that I&#39;d see 16G Ram, and 108 megapixel camera, 40 megapixel selfie, and 8K video on the phone in 2020....Samsung did again!!
S20 ultra HAS NO SNAPDRAGON 865 in Europe, it has Exynos 990 which is 20% slower (but is doesn&#39;t cost less money). Many europeans will miss that fact and wont understand why gameplay isn&#39;t stable and smooth all the time on their device. For Europeans, if you want the best, the s20 series aren&#39;t because of this.
Hey marq do you think it‚Äôs worth it to upgrade from an iphone xs max to this ? I like watching videos on my phone mainly youtube\snapchat and gaming so I definitely dig the bigger screen and I‚Äôm sick of the face lock and want to use the fingerprint thing like the old days
Honestly prices on flagship phones r getting bizzare...next gen price will prolly be within 3000 dollar range...
There is no sub-6 in Malaysia and some other countries in my region. Also, S20 and S20+ that will be sold in my region will not support 5G completely.
Still snapchat will suck on it
You know it&#39;s crazy tech when there is ZERO talk of call quality!
do you think that there is a note <br> version is coming?\
&#39;Ultra&#39; is Samsung&#39;s version of &#39;Pro&#39;, they dont throw that word around as gratuitously as some other manufacturers right now.<br><br><br>Im dyingüòÇ
But it doesn&#39;t have a headphone jack..
I don&#39;t even use the camera on my phone that much...
15,510 comments - you will need an AI machine to read them.  Telephoto lens and 100X zoom is great for construction sites.
Don‚Äôt see the link to the 108mp camera video.
Yo Marques. Am a fan of yours but after watching so many of your reviews on Samsung phones I noticed a subtle sarcasm and fallacy towards Samsung devices. Are you on Apple&#39;s payroll? You should be grateful for how Samsung is pushing technologies forward unlike Apple. Your reviews used to be neutral and informative which helped greatly in the past when it came to packing that purchase decision. Now you seem very bias. Come clean to us please.
My brain-s20 ultra<br>My heart-s20 plus<br>My hands-s20

&quot;why did Samsung and apple skip 9?&quot;<br>&quot;bcz 7, 8, 9&quot;
I only have one camera on my phone
I got to $1400... do the people who buy these lie/pretend they brought the cheaper verion to avoid judgement? Anyone on here thinking they need this?
RIP headphone jack
Not sure why mmwave is supported on Ultra but not on S20,althought both have same SD865modem
40 mp front camera? Come on, that&#39;s just retarded.
This s**t is getting boring. There is nothing unique at all just big numbers.. my s8 is still working just fine.
Will you buy S20 or face mask? Pick your choice.
And here i am with my galaxy s7...
Great üëçüëç
One + 7t Pro is unbeatable
Add the word IMPRESSIONS at the very start of the video. Because as of now, it is worthless as it is. I am in for reviews and not for a quick glimpse and a tease.
Jesus they are making phones uglier each year
Why is Samsung more expensive then a iPhone?
2025: Samsung is more branded than apple<br><br>Me with Samsung: I want apple!!
Me: is that a gas stove on the back?<br><br>The S20 camera looking at me like wtf

Samsung Cheat .... they should have Samsung S11 first.. they jumped staright to S20
Hello everyone.. Good day.! I‚Äôm New on YouTube. I knew MKBHD most popular channel at all time. Thats why i came here for promote my channel.. Please check it out my channel &amp; subscribe for Logo Designs. I hope you support us.. ThanksüëçüèΩ
Why they don&#39;t launches Samsung Devices with snapdragon in India even though exynos is a good processor still many people prefer snapdragon üòêüòêüòêüòêüòêüòê this really feels bad they are destroying their own market bcz india plays a big role in market shares as people are just crazy  heir in buying devices when they comes to market
Bring on the 7 Inch phones!!!
is &quot;Call&quot; feature still in there?
Might as well make the whole back the camera now, damn
In vietnam, s20 ultra only 1150$
i want that but idont have money
I read that Qualcomm Modem X55 used in S20 series supports all bands of 5G frequencies i.e. low, mid and high bands. Then, why is it that different models of S20 Ultra are offering selected frequencies only for 5G. Is the limitation due to the fact that different frequencies require different antennas in addition to the X55 Modem and there is not enough space in the phone to accommodate all these antennas? But, I see no such limitation for 2G, 3G and 4G bands as S20 series is offering virtually all the bands for 2G to 4G. Is it because only a few antennas are required for 2G to 4G?
It&#39;s here, it&#39;s ugly
No curved screen :(
In India s20 ultra is cheaper than 11 pro..lolüòÇ<br>When is apple going to do something about itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I had a 5100mah in the Lenovo P2... so this is the least they could do. Impressive nonetheless, what sucks with Samsung though is that we in Europe get the shitty Exynos. Snapdragon version is MUCH faster in multicore, as usual.
This guy is paid by apple to mock Samsung
P30: U can zoom the moon.<br><br>S20: Behind moon.
Even tho the phone is so big, it still looks small in Marques&#39; hand üòÇ
I&#39;m still using my fkn core prime.
This is why I choose Samsung every time! And in my opinion, my s8+ s9+, and s105g all had amazing cameras. I was even complimented by an iphone user who&#39;s phone was six months newer. So there&#39;s that.
LMAO this phone has as much RAM as my gaming PC.
2019: Phone that comes with a camera<br>2020: Camera that comes with a phone
Samsung needed that 45w charger money damn. I see a switch to the new oneplus in a few months when the hype dies down.
I like turtles.
Samsung releases phone with 16 Gb ram<br>and My phone still has 16 GB internal storage : (
Insane
Samsung releases a new flagship:<br>Everyone: <b>this is the best Display Samsung has ever made</b>
Go to r/android on reddit. Seems like people are finding out Samsung has lied about some camera specs on their new s20, s20pkus and s20 ultra. There‚Äôs a few upset people in there. Did Samsung lie?
In 2021 this device will cost adequate amount of money and we can talking about it )
Nice video
They should&#39;ve called it Samsung galaxy s20 + ultra ;)
2032:the whole back has camera&#39;s
Soon we r gonna see a camera with a ‚Äú calling option‚Äù as the highlight.
The hell you gon do with 16gb of ram? 8gb is sufficient, they should make the chips faster and more efficient in terms of battery consuming not stacking rams up.
Ouch, Samsung finally got 108MP.<br><br><br>Xiaomi got a new challenger.
What about software support?
Until new iphone comes in
S20
OF COURSE ITS WORTH 1399!

huawei: we are first to have 50x zoom into the moon<br>Samsung: 100x zoom into the space, wow i see captain Marvel
Hi sir, i really like your videos and i really like the way you actually review the products. I just want you to upload a video on apple service. The way they take huge amount of money for nothing. Apart from that on their exchange scheme. Which we pay more than half the amount of the product to get back the same product. <br>I really want a video on that coz companies listen to you. <br>And Please guide me and contact me if you can help me with my iphone 8 plus issue.
Anyone have the link for the video he mentioned at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsvw_Db-y4&amp;t=264">4:24</a> about the main camera?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsvw_Db-y4&amp;t=90">1:30</a> I saw him try to do the iPhone backswipe
did you changed your mic? it is very &quot;echoed&quot; (dont know the real term).
It all sounds delightful.but I have absolutely no idea what you&#39;re talking  about..I just dont understand interpreting specs!?! Is it just me? Im not tech savy and have a Note 9..er still not entirely sure how to use my S pen üôà. Must be showing my age!
U need a stand for the 100 zoom..
i`ll wait till august or so for the price to drop a little bit and i`ll get the ultra!
is it me or galaxys phones are getting more expensive than iphones
S10 ke bad s11 nhi sida s20 Samsung things aur back camera ka design apple se Liya lagta hai
Meh
Now where&#39;s that winning lottery ticket?? Mmm...
I am sorry but this is the problem with society. Tablets dont emphasize their cameras. It is based mostly on performance. Why do cell phones make it a main focus to broadcast the capabilities of their cameras? Social media has forced phones to go into this direction. I purchase devices based on performance and functionality
Never count digital zoom as zoom. Ever.
It&#39;s less money than IPhone 11 Pro max and much better than IPhone too
Imagine 12/16 gb ram AND snapdragon 865
Ultra impression!
On October 4, 2019, the Dutch national newspaper Trouw published a report with the headline ‚ÄúTribunal names China a criminal country.‚Äù <br><br>The opening paragraph read:<br><br>‚ÄúThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has seized power for seventy years. Let us review it together.‚Äù<br><br>The subsequent text described the CCP‚Äôs harvesting of organs from living Falun Gong practitioners and the final judgment of the independent China Tribunal in London earlier this year.<br><br><br>Dutch national newspaper Trouw carries a report entitled ‚ÄúTribunal names China a criminal country‚Äù on October 4.<br><br>The article stated that the China Tribunal&#39;s investigations were based on solid evidence and firsthand testimony.<br><br>‚ÄúIn order to get live organs and kill people, CCP doctors select organs when the victims are still alive,‚Äù the author wrote.<br><br>‚ÄúAs early as 2006, there have been reports that the Falun Gong practice group is the main target.

Are you are about only the Ultra having mmWave? I thought the plus had it too.
Fun fact: no one does zoom that much in any time in their life
watching this on my s8 plus any one ?
Glue on a domino.<br>When my note 8 dies New phone&#39;s / camera 2023 imagine
Only MKBHD can hold a 6.9 inch phone and make it look regular sized.
The thing about Samsung is that, when you process the photos in a photo editing app the result is really bad. The quality is not good unlike iPhone, huawei and LG phones I I think they have considered this aspect.
I will never pay to a phone more than 700 usd. No matter how much i earn. I think its really a waste since there will be better version coming next year.
How ironic he uses the apple watch series 5 üòÇ
Awesome video bro I like the way you do your job üëèüëè
I&#39;ve yet to see a phone review where anyone actually talks about it&#39;s ability to make &amp; receive calls...
But Sony is freaking out about asking 500 for the PS5
You know what we will be doing with that zoomüòé
All these smart ‚Äúphones‚Äù are way too massive.  Cannot wait for these manufacturers evolve deeper into the 21st century.  I‚Äôll wait for the new foldable flip phones.
I think phones are bad for your eyesight. When will tablets take over
Joe: you said 100x zoom ?
What&#39;s ur favourite phone !!?
Hi
When you take good pictures of someone but they look away because of the camera
You are always bias you never talk well about samsung .....unfollowing asap

if this was running win10, im in !
The S20 Ultra is overpriced and a niche product. And if you are using 100X Zoom that would be really creepy in most cases.
You are ugly as fuck marques
Marques can you please do a review on laptops that are suitable for students in 2020 please. Thank you I appreciate it.
Man, these phones are getting crazy. I love galaxies, but for me it&#39;s still simple, I like small phones with my goddamned jack! Phones are tools, they have to fit to my use and not the other way around.. so if new phones have 20 inch screens, fold 7 times and send signals to Jupiter, awesome! But I still want screens that fit in my hand and headphones that don&#39;t need battery. Call me crazy.
I just got a new phone üò¢
Ultra
Ultra or z
just got the note 10+, wish I didn&#39;t rush out to replace my dying iphone. done with apple, love owning my files!
I&#39;m at the point with smartphones that I would rather get something like Nokia 7.2 because it has Android One and it&#39;s good enough. I don&#39;t like bloat, and I don&#39;t honestly see any reason to get flagship phones anymore. And I have had flagship phones since iPhone 4. I&#39;m just regular phone user,  though I like to customize my phone with nova launcher and such. I need battery life, decent camera and small bezels. <br>Unless you game on your phone, you just don&#39;t need massive performance. Only games that need that amount of power are rpg and fps games and it&#39;s just crappy experience no matter how you go about it. There&#39;s literally no reason to get flagship aside from being amazed at it for a while and then you just do all the same things in it you could have done in your previous phone or some cheaper phone.<br>I would buy Samsung phones if they made Android One versions, I would even be willing to even pay some extra. I think Samsung still makes the best phones. Though I don&#39;t think I would buy anything that&#39;s more than $600. As technology has gotten better, my priority has changed to OS and price. Because you can pretty much ignore specs and even low end phones have decent camera and small bezels.
In Marques we trust
Maybe hacker could do something with the zoom
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsvw_Db-y4&amp;t=385">6:25</a> The moment you notice he&#39;s holding a $1400 phone over the edge of a balcony

after he said 1400 dollars I just stopped watching, no piece of crap that will be obsolete as soon as I buy is it worth that much
Killer camera
Here I am thinking should I buy S20ultra or a new bike.
Competition is great for business...I love the times we‚Äôre living in...
Camera looks UGLY.
This video has 6M views and that video @mkbhd is asking us to watch before this has just 4.3M views. <br><br><br><br>People: don&#39;t worry we will understand what u say
At this point, Samsung is just coming off as try hard like redmi, OPPO etc, with gimmicks and marketing stunts. For one thing, Apple has done its marketing right.
I never left why are u welcoming me
I feel gansta when i did not click on the other video and just kept wachting this video
The camera bump should not matter, any sane person buys a good protective case anyway
Apple: this year we should make a camera which turn to a phone
Can you please next time talk about safety on Android phones
Wow! 100X zoom every stalker will going to love it..<br>Love From India
I pre-ordered mine on Wednesday! I&#39;m excited. I currently have the S10+ so hopefully it won&#39;t be too big üòÇ
I&#39;ll wait some 5 years until this technology becomes commonplace and affordable
cmon bruh samsung isn&#39;t that bad they did perfect justice which iphone never thinks of. The price is perfect because these aint mi 108 cameras but they are samsung&#39;s. apple sells a phone at 1400$ with an 18 W charger. A note 10 or an S10 or oneplus 7t is a better buy then 11maxpro
All the phone upgrades of the last two years seems pointless to me except for higher refresh rates. I don&#39;t feel the desire to buy a new phone and my HTC U11+ is from 2017. It&#39;s not only that I don&#39;t need it, I just don&#39;t want to, whereas with cars and clothes and watches it always happen to me  that I&#39;d like to buy more. Phones used to feel the same way to me. I think that&#39;s a symptom of the smartphones companies not being able to offer significant functionality upgrades in the last two years.
Will apple in September able to show up?....this is big even though on paper...Cupertino hope u have smthng up ur sleeve.
WHAT????. My laptop is 8gb ram and this phone is 16gb. OOHH NOO
Regular S20 is going to be my way to go.
Hilarious a bit when a Phone gets 16gb RAM while my PC still runs 4gb RAM...<br>Hilariously Painful though... ü•¥
Well I guess that 100x zoom equals no excuses for capturing poor quality Cryptid vids.

Just a few months away from making a phodslr.
I don&#39;t understand why Samsung copied iPhone Design?
The camera technology of this mainstream junk was stolen from Huawei p30 pro .
Pricey
Way too expensive, waiting for apples answer to that... i think will be much better option
Spec is insane. This might finally push me to buy a Samsung phone
Do ROG phone 2 vs S20 line
i could never spend that money for a phone with a giant hole in the screen
Wow! You talk so clear and educated!
They should have release this 3 years from now to early
Wtf 108MP
How did you get the phone before release date?
Wtf 16 GB ram???...my i5 laptop has 4gb ...

im so excited for when the note comes... who knows what samsung has under its sleeve for that... im pretty sure the note20 is going to be a monster
Ultra
I&#39;m waiting for the next Galaxy Note Plus or the Galaxy Note Ultra phone... will probably be about $1,500, but I&#39;m still using the Galaxy S8+, which still works well and looks awesome, so I&#39;ve had time to save $$$... I&#39;ll be crying &amp; kicking myself once I spend it though... lol... I spent $1,500 on the Apple iPad Pro 12.9 256gb with accessories... it was almost worth it- minus the $180 dead beat keyboard...
It&#39;s funny how we thought the &quot;Galaxy Mega&quot; from 2013 was huge (6.3&quot;) and nobody would buy.. and now ppl are buying (6.9&quot;) phones for 1400$.<br>What a crazy little world we live in. :/
Next year 144hz displayüòÄ

Just discovered your channel a few weeks ago...wish I would&#39;ve found earlier...great job~~ I was wondering if you knew the names of the companies making the cameras/sensors in the S20s? I know there are multiple camera companies but can&#39;t seem to find which companies are making the cameras for this galaxy version. Thanks for answering and wish you continued success on the channel.
where is the video about the 108Mp camera he&#39;s talking about at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsvw_Db-y4&amp;t=272">4:32</a> ?
16G RAM or what?????

Dear Mr. Brownlee , please compare the photocapability to the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 . I like to know if it has the same edgeproblems with the quality in photos. Its the same sensor , it should ^^ . You know alot about camtech, please tell us why that is üëçüèøüòÅ

Ah, and there we go with the <br>&quot;Oh apple products are better&quot; and the <br>&quot;Oh Samsung is the best&quot;<br>Like y can&#39;t we jus<br>Say that apple and Samsung products are good.
I need 1399 bucks :)
homie forgot about the selfie cam
What makes this phone expensive is just the camera, the camera that we don&#39;t need.
Just now pre booked S20 ultra ..very exticted to have in hands. Bye bye my s10+
And iPhone users will still beleive that their phone is better üòÇ
Hi Marques <br>I asking you for a favour <br>If you can give me this S20 Ultra as a gift And I will be appreciated that
Iphone 11 Pro or This Samsung?
So.. where is the camera video?
I&#39;m honestly between the ultra and the s20+. Not sure if the camera and battery will be worth the extra $200
You know you broke when a android phone has better spec than your pcüòî
Xiaomi mi 10 pro half the money more beautiful design üí∏üí∏
I still love ‚ù§Ô∏è iPhone üì≤
The Samsung software + bloatware is still terrible. I cant buy Samsung until they sort this out.
Support me üôè
TRUMP will have this phone banned in the USA due to its 100x zoom. Will think its a spy tool.
hey please review about Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro.
Sooooooo the note isn&#39;t the ultra Flagship anymore? I don&#39;t know what Samsung is doing anymore with all the different phones that they&#39;re throwing at us but at least they&#39;re naming scheme is easier to follow than Sony&#39;s
Yeah the weird black rear camera bump is becoming a trend in the smartphone industry,like how fake exhaust tips on m0st cars now.
What brand watch are you wearing?
If Samsung Doesn&#39;t Release A Son Goku UI Themed Variant Of This, I Will Literally Buy An iPhone.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsvw_Db-y4&amp;t=193">3:13</a> beautifull shoot i loved it
Starting at $1,400 Samsung and I aren&#39;t speaking the same language at all also I intensely dislike the back design I hated it on the iPhone, on the Samsung it just reminds me of a six burner stove
Wait till xiaomi bring out a phone with similar specs but 1/4 the price
wouldn&#39;t it become 1 Gigapixel already?
how fast is the charging speed?
Why S10 to direct S20 because of its 2020 ? Just curiosity..
Talk to me when they make something practical like technology for having the camera behind the display and appear when you use it so they don&#39;t have that ridiculous hole punch at the top of the phone.
Regular S20
Hole punch still a fail
Watching this in my galaxy s8. Eeeeerrrrrr.....
damn ADs they are everywhere ü§Ø
&quot;Mark-ass Bownleyy&quot;
How does this compare to the Note 10 Plus? Is 120hz really THAT much faster, for example? I was really looking forward to getting the Note 10 Plus, but now, I am not so sure.
Without spen. It is Garbage!
This guy is so deeply in Samsung&#39;s pocket, it&#39;s not even funny!
Samsung is showing off now, finally.
Jahntu fhon
No matter how much costly it is, we will be able to buy it for 300 to 500 dollars within year 2022.. üòÑüòÑ I&#39;m gonna buy it than... üòÑüòÑ
I am waiting for Alon Musk to come up with his phone... it will be called PhoneX, and will be run by hydrocells!
You need it for fancams lmao
can anyone subscribe me ?
Because of this phone, you can just buy a GenAd seat on concerts and zoom in on the artists faces

Reminds me of them Chinese that put 100 megapixels on the box but in reality there are only 5.
looks like the smartphones technology reached its top
No jack no party
Nothing else to say, just ew.
So cool asf
&quot;6.9 inch which is nuts&quot; I like that part.
Samsung guyz are renewing interfaces and launching new technologies but why people are still fond of using iphones which have the same interfaces and technologies since such a long time?? The answer would be android still sucks and iphone rules the marketüòôüòôüòôüòô
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
fuck what did you do to 108 mega pixel it will never be a great and nice picture 12 megapixel get the nice and great picture!  i dont get why they put 108 mega pixel hahah lol! iphone 11 pro max still the best!

Marques Brownlee Chipset? in New Zealand no full-fat Snapdragon 865 that the US and other regions get? NZ gets Exynos chipsets  (slighterworse battery performance/ day running? What difference to consider?  64mp or 128 GB microSD?
Which phone do you like?
Bro for a person who travels a lot is this s20 ultra phone would be good in camera context i mean
I know you talked about camera etc an number don&#39;t matter but would you rather choose a 64hz or a 120 hz screen i mean big numbers don&#39;t matter lol
xiaomi poco f3 hold my beer.
It&#39;s a flop. Samsung&#39;s trying too hard
How much price
None
the phone you need to run elder scrolls blades smoothly in 2020
Samsung is in race with NASA. üòÖ
awesome!
You should make a 60/120 fps 1080p video so that we can experience the smoothness of that display xD
still waste
Still cheaper than iPhone 11 pro max, which costs approx 1500 USD for base 256GB variant here in India.
I hope these phones don‚Äôt blow up like the note 7s
Koreans so exorbitant. According..their economy
Does it still have heart rate sensor?
It&#39;s not a Smartphone, It&#39;s a Superphone
Give me plese
IPhone looks ugly I hate iPhone even in s20 ultra there will be lot of fun to get 100x zoom
Yes it&#39;s better camera than iPhone make camera comparison with iPhone it&#39;s better than iPhone camera, display and iPhone is nothing in front of s20 ultra
Now canon and Nikon should add a mobile features on their camera‚Äôs

Best smartphone ever
this phone is a beast and also it&#39;s price
when will pocket sizes catch up with smartphones?
price plz
Played with the 108mp at Best Buy today with a few of the sale people. Tested out the zoom on the phone. Pretty good up to 20x after that pictures started looking like trash. At 100x zoom the pictures looked like blurry blobs. Played with other features of phone for about an hour. Difference in cpu speed was negligible. Screen didn‚Äôt look any more vibrant then the note 10 plus next to it. 120hz was good but screen lost some punch cuz well 1080p. Not sure if there is a real need for 120hz as there isn‚Äôt much for content that uses it. It seems more like a spec war like who‚Äôs dick is bigger. Compared some photos between s20 ultra and iPhone 11 Pro Max and didn‚Äôt see much of a difference. Software is still same as note 10 plus. 16gb ram vs 12gb ram absolutely no difference.  Then looked at price tag and laughed hysterically. 2500.00!!!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Wow Samsung. You didn‚Äôt just move up a bit you took a running jump. Clearly isn‚Äôt worth it full price. Asked about financing and at 78 dollars a month this is ridiculous. Gonna wait to see what comes out from other companies this year. Cuz clearly I want to be able to afford a couple mortgage payments instead of marginal upgrade. This is my true unpaid review of the s20 ultra.
Not enough storage space
Eventually I understood. I will have to wait for the launch of Galaxy S 40 and then I can afford this one.
Finally I can buy s7 now.
‚ÄúSo this brings us to the most important part of the phone... the camera. ‚Äú. Why do we even call it a phone anymore?? Hahahaha
2010: 3.5in display<br>2020: 3.5in camera bump
I‚Äôm xs max user and bored, will take this s20 ultra ü§©
Apple: when did you come out with this<br>Samsung: when<br>Apple: yuh<br>Samsung: no when did I ask
One day we gonna make a phone which has a fan,a mixer,a cooler,a oven,and a....a...bathtub everything in it.
Hole punch wtf? It&#39;s 2020 bruh
So does this phone have the same restrictions for refresh rate as the non-ultra variants? You edited in a clip for them, but not sure if it applies to the phone with more ram
Need advice. I got a student discount so I can get the S20+ for around 800 Usd and the Ultra for 1050$. I don&#39;t really need the 100x zoom but I think it&#39;s a pretty good deal?
No more Bixby button?  SOLD!!!
#3 on trending
! They keep on adding more cameras (its going to look Iike an octopus one day), keep on making the screen bigger ( will be a Wacom tablet one day)... But they should; focus on screen durability so we can rock these cool cell designs without cases, they should develop a all in ONE camera, they should focus on making the batteries thinner but with larger capacities... You know... They should PUSH THE ENVELOPE and CREATE! Yet... They just add more cameras, usually use the same battery capacities, fragile materials... BORINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!
Future : full of cameras in the back with 5000 mega pixel camera
No thank you, Im gonna stick with my s9 lmao.
The most ridiculous specs I&#39;ve ever heard...
Huawei/Xiaomi : makes zoom phones<br><br>Samsung: makes zoom phones<br><br>then apple comes and creates their own and calls it new and innovative
