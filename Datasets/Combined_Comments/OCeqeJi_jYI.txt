❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The end..... Express the feelings of all the students.. That&#39;s the reality of schools colleges and Institute 😔Really the students have so many pressure on them .... And teachers only see that we are not competing there homeworks asingments Or projects they really don&#39;t know that we learning max 10 subjects and daily we get homework of each subject  .... If they can teach only one subject then how we can learn 9 to ten subjects daily 😢Those who are agree with this comment and ashish bhaiya<br>👇
the last scene was too relatable
Bro that Id part was sooo relatable I cannot 😭
😭😭😭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCeqeJi_jYI&amp;t=753">12:33</a> Bhaiya sant ho jaoo 😢
2024😂😂
This is the voice of millions of Students 😢 being a average student it hurts a lot when u try ur level best but the teachers taunt u instead of appreciating ur efforts. Due to this many students are suffering from anxiety and some are having sucidial thoughts. We badly want our Indian Education System to change. Here they only brainwash us that more marks = more intelligence.
❤ heart touch video last scene

Bat to sahi hai bhai😢😢
Bhi you can express all the students life😢😢😢😢😢😢
PTA nhi kab Tak hamare Desh Mai es very serious matter ko sirf comedy platform mai he present Kiya jayaga because es pur action liya jna tu impossible he lg rha hai
The lesson behind this is absolutely overwhelming for students like us. The ones who care deserves success but the ones who suffers deserves a salute because even after facing drawbacks they keep running no matter how much the wound of teacher&#39;s, parents and world&#39;s taunt for not being better or as so called smart and intelligent like others pains
Im still watching Ashish vdo in 2024 ❤️❤️
Student ki life aasi hi hoti hai 😢

Tum to bs physics karvati ho hamne to 9 subjects parhne ha .<br>Samjhati ase ha jase koi news par rha ho kuch smajh nhi ata jo likha hota ha vo parh ke suna deti ha are yar itna to ham ghar me bhi dekh ke parh le ge agar ase parhna hota to school kyu ate sach me zaleel kya hova ha .  Really this is the video in which someone tell the reality of Schools and Students .

Besically i had watched the video before but now I am watching again the only diffrence is now I am at college and this thing is now hurting a lot. <br>You travel 30km only for attandance because not a single teacher knows fuck about teaching, but the lecture gets cancelled and you now have to travel again with only disappointment and anger.

At the end, sir you spoke the utter truth. A truth that everyone knows, but it remains unspoken. What an irony, where our education system asks for us to be vocal, it self suppresses our voice.

And I after that I fully fucked that teacher&#39;s life by getting into AIIMS bhubaneswar

Wow!! Thank you so incredibly much for understanding how it feels to be a student. Because our life is, tbh the toughest. People may say it will get harder once u grow up, but the amount of stress and anxiety given by school is the absolute worst. If we don&#39;t submit our work on time, then teachers humiliate us and say that we will never achieve anything in our life, even though they are the ones who are teachers in a random school.
Indian education system kills productivity
Hashtag humane ya aise he hota hai

Ek number
the last one was heart touching
Like I&#39;m noticing, everyone here is going through the same frustration...inter college politics is biggest threat to talent...in my college too, when they put the internal and practical marks, students who get passing marks, suddenly their internal marks goes to 95-100% and those who study thoroughly and sincerely, they get less marks and when someone argues then they say that this is based on internal performance, like this is beyond limits, they blackmail if we go against them...like i can&#39;t even explain inter college politics
Kon kon 2023 me dekh raha hai
yes last one is correct
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCeqeJi_jYI&amp;t=680">11:20</a>😘

Bhai Mera 11th college ye mahine chalu hora gand fati padi hai
Watching is 63 milion log  but like 3.5 milion and 122k comment
It&#39;s said that student life is the most beautiful part of life... but actually the life of students ( especially good-medicore science students) after 10th is an application made of tension, competition, criticism, Jealousy, stress, depression and sometimes SUICIDE...
Bilkul aisa hi hota hai
Joke+reality= that is ashish chanchani 🥺❣️🙌

Would sound weird to someone but I really don&#39;t like my college and college life. It was the toughest period of my life. Neither do I miss those folks (i don&#39;t call them friends) with whom I used to sit in classes. I&#39;m happy now and earning enough to eat and survive on my own.
as a science student it&#39;s true....n when someone ask job experience the fire from my heart rise up😡😁
The ending we wasn&#39;t a joke it is reality 😂

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCeqeJi_jYI&amp;t=630">10:30</a> was related evry students 😢

I agree this video is full of comedy but the last scene was not, it was the absolute reality of our indian education system. <br>Abe saale kisika baap mar jaye dharti ulat palat ho jaye fir bhi inko kya chahiye 75% attendance. Homeworks likhte likhte saala gand hath mein chala aya pen chalate chalate copy khatam ho gaya abe gandu ye pura saal project mangenge assignments mangenge project mangenge wo bhi sajaya hua saala gand maro decoration ko inko to andar mein kya likha hai parni nahi hai kisi se baat karte karte pura project check karenge aur marks denge decoration pe .saala inko pata bhi hai pura prohect banate banate kitne research karne parte hai lekin nahi inko to decoration chahiye saala pata bhi hai inko ki kitna paisa lagta hai hamko. Itne bojh denge pith par fir bhi agar class mein answers sahi se na de pao to class k bahar khare karwaenge abe hamne kabhi kaha apko ki light chik chik kar rahi hai naya light lagwao kabhi bhi kahi hai ki current chala jaa raha hai bar bar pankha bandh ho ja raha hai kuch nahi kaha aur nahi inko kuch farak parta hai .par saara kam to hame karna parta hai assignments journals projects homework ghar jakar tusion coaching class abe saala PADHU KAB ham bachche hai koi robot thodi ma hai ki itne saare kam karne k bawjud bhi na soye na khaye SIRF PADHTE RAHE ch8tiya kat k rakkha hai aur thodi der rest karo aur tab agar koi parent dekh le ki ham REST kar rahe hai to haalat hi kharab ho jayega inke taane sunkar. SAALA KARE TO KARE KYA KARE MAR JAYE 😖😖
The reality 🤐
Bhai mujhe rona agaya
😪😔😪😔 I like this video
TRUE ❤
Hi
It&#39;s a true think
Sahi kaha bhai student ki life esi hi hai 😢😢
The Last part was soo touching it&#39;s actually true I just finished my 9th finals and will be going to 10th and there is no drawing subject and sports period will be taken by other teachers and I really want to be an animator it feels hard
Sahi hai bro likh likh ke hath par chhale pad gaye 😢😢😢😢
His last dialogues were justttt awesome real💗
This video deserves 300 plus million
Well done bro
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCeqeJi_jYI&amp;t=680">11:20</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCeqeJi_jYI&amp;t=528">8:48</a> <br>Generally cbse need 75% attendance but in our school need 100% attendance I don&#39;t know what the f**k principal do with 100% attendance
Great ending 👏
Yes he photo is real life
Endiing wasn&#39;t a joke 😢
This video is 100% relatable with students life
Bilkul sahi kha last one was great..<br>Humara education system pehle Aisa nhi tha jb se bahari akramad hue Bharat pr jab aisa ratta maar bana system 😤🙏
bhaiya ne actual dil ki bhadas nikal di, felt really happy, our whole system is based n the way that if u try something new and different from others everyone else will pull ur leg in such a way that u won&#39;t be able to stand up ever again, they start to doubt themselves and that&#39;s when they lose half-way, i want to be an engineer myself, not bcz of others but bcz of my own choice and will, what i want to do is far away from what will be taught to me in the process, never really understood the concept of learning organic chem for becoming an engineer but find absolutely no other way other than that, trying something new is way hard than any one can even expect, people focus tend to focus on the one red rose growing between the bunch of white roses and they try their best pluck that flower and murder its existence.
This is boys
And there is so much drama in big schools that the pressure of studies is put on the students. and Students can go into depression due to high pressure. And such a meaningless book is given to read, there is no use of reading it. First of all our family puts so much pressure on us regarding our education. The school pays more attention to our marks than our learning If you get good marks then you or if you don&#39;t  then you are very bad. Our teachers tell our future  seeing our marks.
Hiiiiii
This was shot in my school 🏫😊
This is called reality

Well u said the truth bro <br>My life story is also kind of same tho😢🥺😭
Students like karo , share Karo , comment kro <br>Or education system wale : thodi si sharam kro 🙏 dhandha bna rkha h education ko ajkal jiske fees 2 lakh thi ab sidha 12 lakh kr di ?fees sirf itni honi chaiye Jo bache khud part time krke de sake these days even parents ko loan lekar pdhana pdhta h . Learning ke liye udhar the person who discovered education must be ashamed of the system now !
Very relatable
