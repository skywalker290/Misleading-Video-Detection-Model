Da am uitat la toate filmele Unde este realitatea și unde nu este realitatea o să spui că de ce și alte lucruri în schimb trebuie să înțelegi că mă duc pe realitate în fiecare dată foarte mult o să spui că în film nu este în realitate badam este umbra foarte multe lucruri când te face film și când se face la se vede umbră foarte multe
My favourite actress Anushka 🥰🥰
Even her acting is shit...lucky to have yrf signed her....and majority of her films were hit coz of superstars..be it srk, Aamir, salman...not coz of her out of the earth acting...now girls like this are smart so she...played Smart and took kohli...now she is safe..
Oh she did something out of earth......owwww
I watched NH10 ,I really appreciate  the charector you did in the film 👏👏

Your mindset reflects in your work Anushka. Whenever your movie  trailer comes out, or your production house dishes out content I always know there is something to look out for. You dare to experiment, strive to give quality content and perhaps the first leading lady to not dance on an item song.

I wish this woman who knew and worked with Sushant had been more concerned about how he died. I wish she had joined the JUSTICE FOR SUSHANT movement. It&#39;s not just about Sushant; it&#39;s about the criminality in Bollywood  and Democracy in India. It&#39;s about the many deaths. It&#39;s about the freedom (Arnab on Republic) as well as the integrity (blind items) of the press. Sushant, noble soul. Remember, BOYCOTT BOLLYWOOD and their brands. Sushant, noble soul, is bringing about a much needed revolution of awareness, honesty, humility, creativity, spirituality, intelligence and equality in art, in life, in the world.
She is a such a great actress but how simple and down to earth girl. She is just talking straight forward and like common people.
Children start at 16 ....🤣🤣🤣
Very much for your kind words ❣️
Anushka in my right ear and Anupama in the left, what a nice feeling lol
बेहतरीन बातें...
I think she studied in class section B in shoos because she walks for her living only inside her owned house not needing work as homes.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ind">#Ind</a>-use
She is speaking such valid points here but she never spoke a single word against the injustice that happened with SSR.
We dont drink funny now we dope
She is such an inspiration! An amazing actor and a true Girl boss! She really shows that you can have a super career and have a family life too! She is the best

Come on , even she can&#39;t speak well and confidently.🤔
Nonsense woman for Nepalese.
Anuska❤❤❤
She said same statement in hindi in Kapil Sharma show😆😆😆
So nice madam s only shat R kis
look at the honesty of this girl....I am impressed highly
Amazing Anushka! So Proud - fellow Bangalorean!
Am just amazed how there are only 341 comments on this when there should be 600 or 800 but it all proves what Anushka says about being perceived as an &quot;activist&quot;.  I think people saw &quot;NH10&quot; and didn&#39;t want to acknowledge how women (in probably the most extreme way) are not valued.  I don&#39;t think Hindi actors should ever be considered &quot;mediocre&quot; compared to American actors.  Generally there is more expressed emotion, thought and feeling shown either inwardly or outwardly by South Asian actors and people because with American actors it is considered, soft, rural, uneducated and frankly backward when actually, to lack emotion, thought and feeling in one&#39;s acting is backward, regressive and completely stone age.  In American films, one must always seem, tough, sophisticated and in control no matter how smart or stupid.  This Western influence seeps into urban more expensive South Asian films.  But Anushka is right, that she and Kangana are not liked and even Kalki Koechlin are not liked because of their out there right at you &quot;attitude&quot; although Kalki is loved more because she smiles with the attitude and even Tapsee Pannu always holds her ground and makes them eat their words one way or another.  I always want to see Anushka&#39;s films because she is out there not taking the easy road and speaking the truth.  I think Preity Zinta should be making as many films as Saif Ali Khan but he is more valued for being a guy.  This is what I think, Anushka is alluding to.  This is a great interview with Anu.
Super girl  anushka
Wow...what an amazing Interview...not only cause listening to her is always funny and interesting, but cause theres finally a person who is brave enough to talk about the truth. Cause it is already sad that Indian men think they r better (theyre absolutely not!) but that male stars think like that is more ridiculous, cause Bw isnt a &quot;mens&quot; world anymore. Now women start to become the real heroins and also hope that in real life men also realise it soon. Itz a womens world...men have to obey and bring the money xD
She is not having nail paint on...  I can&#39;t think of any celeb who came for any event not giving importance to nail paint ... Love her for that ❤️
Anushka seriously people taste is mediocre that&#39;s why jokar Ranveer singh has become star. Otherwise usko koi rickshaw walla na puche lol
She was damn correct when she said that society calls  these types of women difficult or arrogant or women with attitude who are independent enough to take stand for something.I just don&#39;t understand this concept.Nobody calls men arrogant when they stand for something, instead then society calls them,the initiators or bold.This mindset can never produce anything better for the <a href="http://females.so/">females.So</a>,let the society cry and be the best version of woman yourself without listening to society&#39;s judgements.
“We’re all stars because the taste of people is so mediocre” <br><br>Damn. No lies detected. She said it jokingly but she’s not wrong whatsoever.
Our film industry is very blessed mam by having you this video proves it salute
🙏 God bless you and your family mam
very straightforward come from heart.nice thing
Art her has endless fights. 1st to 4evr.
A fight is a problem and a problem is a fight. Problem&amp;solution/fight.
Art&#39;s mom only eats 3 meals a day.
I am big of anushka sharma she is very beautiful
This Interview awesome 😊 I like Anushka sharma Confidence ,and perspective 😊 she is Real, awesome 😊 I am fan of Aishwariya Bachan but I like Anushka also. Both are Best 👍
Holy fuck<br>That Indian accent lol 😂
Lovely interview ... Real and Rawness. 👏👏👏👏
Always inspiring. Who&#39;s watching this in 2019?
❤️
You will have to help me to meet Leonardo or I will hate you my whole life😊🙏
bakwas...aadhi baaten muh me kha jati h..itni jldi interview....she is just pretending good..
Super women... 😍truely honest
now that l see this again in 2019 it&#39;s not much different than what Kangana was saying...
Oh god she is damn amazing, actually on fire and speaking truth without fear🔥and then the sad reality is I still see the viewers are just <a href="http://364k.like/">364k.Like</a> really!!!!! <br>Really the taste is mediocre!!
First of all, I attended the interview with one of the most popular actresses Anushka Sharma, and listen to her own feelings about women&#39;s rights and roles in Hindi films very exclusive interview woman also parallel to the man so why should think it is down and no value of the woman<br>        I am also saying that everybody else has given the value of the <a href="http://women.so/">women.so</a> thank you for your interview.
Both conversation different to each other and in accurate manner
Anushka you are sooooo real <br>&amp; that i liked a lot in u.
aap kuou aap kuou malum hheyi ham KEEYI kartheyi hheyi ham ham ji
This is the first video that I heard their voices separately, anushka&#39;s voice in left side and interviewer&#39;s voice in right side
When Anushka says &quot;the problem is the problem&quot; she sounds like kartik aaryan in pkp&#39;s monologue.
So pretty Anushka ma&#39;am
Genuine Girl👍
Why are you speaking in English? you&#39;re in India.
how many were here looking for acting tips and  to know about acting tecniques
U never wanted money but u wanted virat<br>Strange
I don&#39;t understand what is her problem with &#39;the activist&#39;
When I see interviews like this I feel like throwing my phone on the wall..
I just love to watch anushka&#39;s interview<br>There is always something to learn from her.<br>I just love the way she is<br>So pure, genuine , honest, straight forward<br>Love her❤️<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23gaurisdanceandyoga">#gaurisdanceandyoga</a>
😃
Cute
Anushka is my fvrt
Because she&#39;s not only an activist but  also she has guts and as a soldier daughter
I love you so much Anushka!! You are such a lovely person, and what a talk, very impressive!! And she was so honest about everything. More power to you Anusha! Keep doing the good work❤️❤️
More power to you girl! Love you Anushka 😘♥️
The reason I love her so much, so humble, so real unlike other actress who fake themselves .you go girl! You gonna change the cinema one day
Shes my new favorite actress and sonakshi theyre both amazing 😊😊😊😊😊
💝 u always anushka.. keep it up!!!
It&#39;s so true, what she says about how nobody&#39;s discriminating on purpose, it&#39;s all ingrained. Consider how in film credits, it&#39;s always the actors whose names appear first. Even when it doesn&#39;t make sense!! E.g., Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, a film I really enjoy, features its main cast in this order: &quot;Abhishek Bachchan, Bobby Deol, Preity Zinta, Lara Dutta&quot;. But Preity was the lead heroine of the film, and Bobby had a supporting role. Why, then, is his name first??
Tomorrow if a director is asked in the movie which he is directing to star Salman Khan and Anushka Sharma who will he pay more? Obviously Salman Khan because he has more fan following and can drive in more audience to the theatres If Tomorrow Anushka Sharma can do the same a director will be more than happy to pay her the same amount so that doesn&#39;t become discrimination that is because Salman Khan has more star following. And if tomorrow you are the main star and a fresher or a new male actor is your leading man obviously he will be paid less so there is no question of discrimination discrimination is just an excuse made by feminist for not taking responsibility
mam mam mam the discrimination you are talking about happens also with men and it is not gender specific it doesn&#39;t only happen with women, should stop giving excuses that only women are being discriminated Men At the workplace face even more discrimination, Especially many women come at a specified time and leave at a specified time and then say and complaint that they do not get equal pay when you are talking about gender equality where is the equality when you are asking for privileges. This is something to do with the traditional roles which women have played in the society that of a house maker and Society and men in specific have always appreciated this role of women today women are participating in all realms of society and in all industries and many of them are doing well but that is not an excuse to complain about the past and keep bragging about it. <br><br>Nobody has stopped women from coming into many different industries but actual science and research shows that many women do not prefer certain fields. <br>Of profession and do not prefer to work in such harsh environment that is why men dominate certain fields for example science and research politics even films and the film industry where there is a lot of uncertainty women always prefer to go into those fields which give them a stable income and where risks are less, That is the reason why women dominate feels like teaching schools clerical and white collar jobs and also in nursing this is not the fault of a man and should not be blamed on men.
Bollywood actresses are themselves imposing the gender norms (inequality in pay, shorter shelf life of actresses etc) by having plastic surgeries, paying so much focus on their beautiful costumes and makeup (done to hide there imperfections and to make them look &quot;beautiful&quot;, not to support their character), and trying to have a perfect body. They don&#39;t focus on their acting skills at all. She herself has done those roles. She has taken up roles opposite successfull male superstar to become a superstar (&quot;I don&#39;t care about money and fame&quot; she said- duhhh!) And come on! age is a pretty important number. So as these so called actresses get older and don&#39;t remain as perfect, they don&#39;t get work. While actresses like Vidya Balan, Tabu try to work on their acting skills and that&#39;s why continue to get roles even after getting married and older. <br>If an actress only sees herself as someone who can offer good looks and not a powerful performance then she can&#39;t expect others to consider her someone beyond it.
Anushka ..kudos man...i love you...watching this in 2017.<br>Also Shahrukh did dear zindagi wherein he didn&#39;t have a proper hero wala role ..the way he keeps the names of his actresses first in credits.
I love her. Wish you a happy married life Anushka
Notice Anushka Sharma&#39;s fake half leg
What she said at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4X9YlbOq24&amp;t=1150">19:10</a> is reflective of the general Indian attitude. Same with our education system.
This is something else❤️ seriously . Everything she said is so correct and insightful 💕how honest. How pure. How true. Anushka you’re are love❤️
Anupama you should arrange a conversation between Kangna and Anushka in this context. It would be fiery .
Anushka seems very honest which makes this interview an interesting one to watch. Very close to kangna ranaut interviews.Kudos to anupama too. Anushka very cutely accepted her relationship with kohli without being asked which was thé beauty of this interview unlike other interviews where the celebs are constantly being asked about their private lives whether or not he/she wants to answer them.
Her voice is annoying
I don&#39;t find her good looking or sexy
She is not at all well spoken
Her English is not so good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4X9YlbOq24&amp;t=890">14:50</a> &quot;People dont like women with guts in this industry&quot; Such a shame even our film industry is this shallow..
anupama is great
Just coz Gender parity is the in thing these pampered brats who get practically everything as freebies want more money. And anushka Fyi Sreedevi and Hema Malini used to do stunts, so you are not shifting the industry. And if u needed better room y not tell the producer rather than whine about  it in here. Sure there are stereotypes, but u pampered people are using this forum to earn more money rather than shift paradigms in society.
I dunno why I can listen to Anuskha speaks...she is amazing!
I love this interview. I&#39;m also a feminist
This continues to be my favourite Anushka interview ever. I love what she stands for. As a girl, I identify with her so strongly! 💪 :-*
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4X9YlbOq24&amp;t=919">15:19</a> Did she just mocked Sonam Kapoor??? Haha... Just kidding. Kangana, Vidya, Anushka Amazing actors.
such a genuine person she is....😇😍
Thank you for the passion and for caring Anushka. Hope other women see that as women we are not just limited to being pretty and shallow, we can be beautiful, stylish and brainy and have an opinion, just like Anushka. What a role model ofr young girls. Thumbs up!!
Love Anushka! &lt;3
fantastic
That was great Anushka. Can you step out of the thing or the situation in which you feel discriminated?. Have you done that till now?. why don&#39;t you come out and show this to the people who can&#39;t see the things as you see?..
ohh more strong than she seems like
Women who speak their mind,strong,independent talented are despised ,loathed everywhere in all fields and branded feminists ,activists etc .
this interview is just superb..its real conversation which we would love to hear .its like we are sitting in front and also part of the conversation.brilliant interview..
Chopra&#39;s laugh is really irritating
well said Anushka.  its in our head how much we say boys nd girls are equal until we stop behaving natural about it nothing gonna change. still we believe that man has to be more powerful than the female in any family that&#39;s where the problem........ highly appreciated..
One. Honest. Celeb. And one mature interviewer!
May be if an established actress like you have taken the step to question the difference, atleast in the matter of the hotel room, the next generation hopefully, sorry definitely, wont face a situation as the same. The friction that which will be created if somebody like you create in the smoothly done discrimination against a woman will definitely matter.
this is the kind of interview I would like to hear to...can connect to what you were trying to convey
more power to you!! amazing, I&#39;m stunned by her strength and courage.
100 likes  anushka
nice interview😃😃
Anushka is an empowering women with courage
Stumbled upon this channel today,, really enjoying the raw, mature conversation here. It really shows actors as just themselves, beautifully done :)
Anupama, has anyone told you and Anushka look like sisters.
brilliant interview. anushka is very confident &amp; sounds powerful. good luck to her for her future projects. she is fantastic actress.
why I am watching this ... lolzz
I think she is trying to find right thing at wrong place! lolzz :D
That is because of Indian tradition of course. She is saying it clearly. We know what is indian tradition ! :D
An excellent interview!!<br>Amazed &amp; felt proud by anushka&#39;s independent &amp; &quot;being just yourself&quot; way of life.
I dare anupama to ask the big actors this question, why do they accept better hotel rooms or a higher pay check. want to hear men&#39;s point of view...
Wonderful interview. Even more an Anushka fan now. Always enjoy watching Anupama Chopra interviews :)
Respect....superb Anushka sharma
NH10 was copied from Eden Lake! and its ending was much much better and realistic than your idiotic movie Ms. Shrama!
All these interviews have actual content and that&#39;s so amazing and refreshing. Gonna binge watch all of &#39;em🙃
change is happening ..aishwaria she is working at 4p
hahahahaha why is anupama even there ? she can ask her own questions and answer them as well ! gapppodi ! love this girl  . yapyapyap &lt;3

There are some decisions that change ur life upside down . Virat is currently the heartbeat of everything in India. Financially or personally all sorted. Go for it Anushka, ladka achcha hai .🙃
I LOVE HER &lt;3
She is a bitch in real life.  I know her personally!!!!
I really wish this interview was longer!!!
Loved Anuskha&#39;s very real Hinglish way of speaking. You don&#39;t need a fake accent to be a successful actor.
wow.. anushka is awesome..
I think Anushka has very good thoughts and strong view points.......Only thing I would say to say is being a bit more formal..Not trying to be rude, all I want to say is just be a bit calm and just remove the &quot;you knows&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; That&#39;s all otherwise you are great :)
What a beauty head to toe, inside out. Super.
Film Companion !!    kitna teiz boltee hai yeh anushka sharma, anupma <br>ji..kiyun..?? itna bol bol kay sar may dard kar deya iss nay, <br>goshh..anushka ka galaa bhi khushk/dry nahee hota itna zyada bol bol <br>kar.
that indian accent though :D :D
&quot;let them do something, then we will know that they are different!&quot; :D<br>Loved it!
more power to you Anushka. what an outspoken girl. love that clarity and confidence
Anupama really knows how to ask questions - i always look forward to her shows and interviews as they&#39;re always executed well  ... Fabbb!!
Itni problem hai to bollywood se chali jaaye
nice lip job...looks good on u
Anushka you use a lot if &#39;like&#39; and &#39;right&#39; for fillers! It gets very annoying after a point!!!
Nice interview. Really eye opening on the skew of how the sexes are treated in Bollywood. Nice of Anushka to open up about all these matters that are actually plaguing the industry.
Respect for the way she spoke
I wish there were more actresses like Anushka in the hindi film industry
Actresses talk about equality, equal opportunity and pay, yet they objectify themselves in to doing item numbers in movies with extreme skin show, just to showcase their desirability. As long as they don&#39;t respect themselves for being more than just an object of fantasy, they will be facing inequality. They must value themselves so that they are respected for what they do to demand seriousness from others.
This must be one of the best interviews...she just knows what she is doing... Keep up girl! &lt;3
Audience don&#39;t care of 100cr or 500 cr.. they watch movies with good story and nice screen-play.
aree yaar... on the name of equality dont make the world monotonous ....men are meant for something and women are meant for something.. that makes the world wonderful...
All due respect... women in the society is reflected in films too. I think let the nature take its course rather than worrying about % of women and men % of different religions involvement caste involvement .. study of that makes you feel discriminated.  Hero is a hero right.. I don&#39;t think character actors get better pay than heroine. Many actors who are males paid much less than many heroines.. so what... that is business.
NH10 was a snooze fest. My wife and I were bored to death during the screening of the film. Seen there, done that...already...by lot&#39;s of film makers.
Going to bottle this interview and pour it over myself as a tonic every time I think, &quot;Am I being unreasonable for asking this?&quot;

Her English is hard to listen to but she makes some very amazing, honest and true points. Kudos to her for being outspoken and being eloquent despite the language barrier. Would love for her to write a column or an article about this issue so she can speak in more detail and express herself more.
Fabtiyaan na kasa karo maharani, tumse kuchh nahin kaha humne
Awesome conversation..........loved it..........
How can this interview get dislikes?! Anushka was right about &quot;mediocre&quot;, &quot;cheap&quot; minds.
Ladies in Bollywood - Anupama, Anushka, Kangna, Shabana Deepika, etc., please keep doing what you are and in whichever way possible. This is how interviews should be; personal on a level where the celebrity can actually speak their mind and opine without any hesitation. What are we to do with who they are dating or where have the spent their last vacation. Amazing job Anupama for interviewing Anushka. Somebody&#39;s talking sense here and working towards real development and enlightenment. More power to women! If this is not done now I fear it will be too late for women to voice their opinions in any platform. And, there is no better way than to start with the bold and honest celebrities. You&#39;ve got this ladies!!
Right swear to god right listen right you know right like right that right
Oh God! Terrible terrible English along with her awful accent.
myaan she is luking absolutely stunning..N well said..More power 2 u beautiful young lady
What Anushka is referring to is called &#39;unconscious bias&#39;. The day I learnt this term, I felt liberated because I was able to have a constructive conservation with those who make decisions that are discriminatory, without using the word discrimination which divides people and doesnt lead the conservation to change.

Kudos to Film Companion for talking about aspects of film making and not purely about stardom! It&#39;s heartening to see people talk about different facets of the industry. Thank you, it&#39;s thoroughly enjoyable.
I m very inspired with this lady after this interview. Thats how honest n blunt people should be. One of the best interviews I have seen!
adore you Anupama :D
excellent interview!!!
did she just say &quot;tits &amp; ass&quot; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4X9YlbOq24&amp;t=601">10:01</a> ? wow...brave girl!!!!!!!!
Thank you, Anupama for asking these questions.  You are making a difference.  Please keep going!
to me none of the top actress will be remember years later except tabu or vidya balan or to some extent kareena.....tabu n vidya are powerhouse performers and what they get paid is much less dan so called top actresses so what u will say to this....
woman disparity of earning.....debate for nothing not abt male or female its only about who pull the crowds to theatre and u get paid accordingly.......if tanu weds manu makes 150 crores its not only kangana ranaut its about anand rai too and the content good content works on even less known actors but a bad content will work on it star power......its they have earned working 25 years Khans devgan kumar they have work their ass off to reach their stardom......its simple producer will pay how much u can bring people to theatre......its not in bollywood its evrywere rdj gets 80 million $ for avengers 2 in a ensembled cast movie now what do u call hollywood producers....so to me this logic of disparity is bullshit
Great to see women with the  power to impact lives talking about and actually attempting to bring about a change in the ingrained patriarchal values and the discrimination against women prevalent in the Indian society. And it is rather gutsy to be frank about a relationship between two people where each belongs to the two most worshipped things in India. Great interview!
Anupama Madam- we want Aamir khan in your show.
Anushka Sharma - you are one amazing woman! Hats off!
Anupama- Always love the way you make your interview a willful dialouge rather than a scripted question-answer round.
She spoke so well, I had to sit down and see the whole video. I like hearing such conversations, please do these more Anupama. On the side note, I have never understood why on earth Katrina Kaif is still in the industry. She&#39;s so bad at acting or inspiring....
loved this interview.....wohoooooo 😆
All the journalists must take lessons from you on how to interview.... It felt as if i was involved in the conversation... Hats off to you
This interview has reiterated the fact that being  the most popular actor/actress is not a proportional to being a brilliant,sensible,humble and grounded actor.We see so many &quot;stars&quot; worshipped but adding nothing of value,neither to society nor to their job.I&#39;m glad we have someone like Anushka ,who is changing the image of a bollywood heroine.She likes to be normal,does not confront to the fashion trends , create an image of glamorous mannequin wearing expensive designers, does not resort to meaningless item numbers for easy bucks,does not make her relationship -a public affair to remain in news everyday, does not put an act of being something she isn&#39;t and all this while being aware of the industry she is working in, not looking for easy bucks and &gt;100 crores, not settling for mediocrity ,having a vision of good cinema and not just her own bank balance and by just being intelligent and sensitive to society.I&#39;ll watch all her movies from now on,just because of the strength she has shown by not being afraid of her voicing her opinions ,being a strong partner in a challenging relationship  and by just being &quot;normal&quot;<br>This a woman ,young girls should admire,not for her fashion,designers ,beauty or relationships but purely for her personality.Anushka and kangana will change the way we look at women in the industry.
More power to u girl...Awsme interview😉✌
Minus the &quot;you know&quot;s and &quot;like&quot;s and &quot;kind of&quot;s this would&#39;ve been stupendous.
why is she telling the same thing again and again
this is one of the best interview done . well behaved yet honest .
respect ...🙏 to this girl ... ...<br>love yaaaa
Nice.... puri bhadass nikal di....
woooo thsi interview was something (y)
At the start, she says she has no idea about collections but NH10 did 35 crores business in India despite being an adult rated. But end part, she says that Movies are now competing for 300 Crores collection. Anupama is pleasantly diplomatic.
Wow I&#39;m a guy but I found what Anushka had to say absolutely compelling and upsetting as well! Who knew that in such a popular, lavish and glossy industry that this kind of discrimination was so apparent? That&#39;s crazy.
Credit to Arjun Kapoor for acting in Finding Fanny where Deepika had the title role.
Aside from George Clooney in Gravity, I also really respect Arnold Schwarzenegger for taking a backseat in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Especially, at the time when Schwarzenegger was the biggest superstar on the planet, that was an unconventional choice.
I&#39;m a diehard SRK fan. Can&#39;t wait for Fan and Raees. Also, SRK gave way to Irrfan Khan and took the backseat in Billu, which I think is very respectable for an actor his stature. I mean King Khan giving way to another actor to shine in a film. Even Rajeev Masand had acknowledged that in his review of the respective film.<br>Not to forget, since Chennai Express, he has been giving the female credit before his own name--which I really respect.<br><br>There&#39;s a reason he&#39;s such an icon and inspiration like no other film star in the world.<br>And no, I don&#39;t dislike other Khans. I really like all actors and more power to all. I just prefer SRK over others because not only is he an amazing actor, he&#39;s just a great figure.
This interview is giving me so much life. Such refreshing honesty is more than welcome.
Oh my goodness! Sense in questions from a media person! Ah! :D
One of the best interviews that I have watched recently... She is really sorted and know what she needs from life .. good job Anupama for the great interview !!!
I wish her English was better so she could speak her mind more eloquently. Great points though. Good on you girl!
This thing was amazing...i saw this interview twice....it gives an honest insight of how the film industry thinks ...hats off to Anushka for doing such work n she must go on even if she&#39;s labeled to be an activist....cuz she is on the right path...n she&#39;ll surely make a mark..<br>Thanku Anupama fr bringing all such interesting stuff to us😘😀
I love how actresses are openly talking about their views of the world. Anushka is so young, and yet she has this craving for making changes and leaving her mark on cinema as something more than just being a pretty face. It&#39;s important when artists know the impact of their work and want to use it in a positive way. Anushka is probably making a lot of girls think about things that would never cross their minds. All those behaviors that she talked about as being ingrained in society become less automatic when someone talks about it. Do you see how many women are here on the comments section, loving it? This interview is a huge thing.<br><br>Thank you for giving her the space to talk about it. Now I feel that I know and admire her so much more. More power to all of us!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4X9YlbOq24&amp;t=922">15:22</a> hahaha! The gibe at the dumb, talentless star-kid (read Sonam Kapooor) was subtle..but you gave it away with the smile towards the camera ;-)
you go girl!
What  a Great Interview..really next gen women kindly get inspired and lead India from the front.Anu the Interviewer brings the best in Anu the interviewee.
Go Anushka! I love her honest opinions, not like Deepika who answered the salary inequity question by saying she doesn&#39;t get involved in these things. These women need to stand up and talk, otherwise nothing will change.
What a fabulous interview. I am a PhD researcher working on Indian actresses from the silent era. I have been poring over newspaper archives from the 1920s, when there was a lot on anxiety over the &#39;respectability&#39; of actresses in the industry. It&#39;s so interesting to look at this within the context of 2015 where actresses expecting basic parity and substantial roles are labelled as &#39;angry&#39;, &#39;activists&#39; with &#39;attitude&#39;. While some things change, some remain the same...<br><br>That being said, the industry is creaking and groaning towards change. I like how this year has seen films with overt feminist themes like NH10, while others have been more subversive - like Piku. The next few years should be very interesting to watch. Thanks again for this fantastic interview.
This whole interview was just a delight ! I absolutely cannot wait to see what she will do ahead. More power to her indeed !
Cheers to that man???
WOOOO Anushka slays! btw I just want to point out that Ranveer did a cameo in FF where he has to be Angies choked up dead husband and Irfan Khan did Piku(and Ranbir said he wished he played that role, dont know if that counts), so there are forward thinking male actors.
awesome stuff AnupamaJi &amp; Anushka
lady u said it all..the way u addressed discrimination on basic level,samll things which people don&#39;t even how it is imbibed in their brains..commendable<br>I have so much respect for u anushka I never saw this side of u before..applauses
Saying it like it is...go Anushka!
she is luking extremly beautiful as alwz😍😘😚
I think the word &#39;society&#39; is thrown around a lot unnecessarily. She talks everything wrong about the film industry and connects that with &#39;society&#39;. I dont understand this.<br>She has acted in movies like &#39;Patiala House&#39;, &#39;Matru&#39;, &#39;Bombay Velvet&#39;, &#39;Dil Dhadakne Do&#39; which have itsy bitsy roles themselves and then she says that the same thing is wrong with the industry. On top of that she says she dosen&#39;t do movies for money.<br><br>BullShit.
An absolutely  amazing and thoughtful interview !! Also Felt sooooo happy when she said touchwood in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4X9YlbOq24&amp;t=1776">29:36</a>
I have not seen any Bollywood actress having as deep a technical knowledge, having knowledge of the state of affairs and a general understanding as great as Anushka. Bravo, for this hard hitting interview. Sexists can comment here in a manner they want, but this interview is 100% truaa
Salman did a movie with Sonakshi (who was unknown and was not a hot/desirable actress).  @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4X9YlbOq24&amp;t=1340">22:20</a>
anushka i like you even more than before after this superb interview
It reminded me of Kangana&#39;s frankness in the TFR interview. Lovely watch.
God, I knew Anushka was different from all others. Natural, straightforward, down-to-heart, humble, intelligent, honest…this girl has it all. It&#39;s a delight to watch and listen to what she has to say. Thanks Anupama for asking the right questions and making such a meaningful interview. Rather than asking stupid questions that will lead to controversies, this discussion is giving us for a change an insight of how an actress is seing the industry.
I was clapping!!!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4X9YlbOq24&amp;t=1088">18:08</a> well said Anushka!!
These girls ( not just the two great ones here) are giving Bollywood a definition .cheers 😊
@Anupama u just might have forgot ..(more I feel is u lied for conversation) ... abt the question &quot;George Clooney&quot; -&quot;Gravity&quot; matter... I remember your that Interview... the way sarcastically u put in front of Main Tera Hero star-cast...<br>btw i am in the middle of the above video and its going good :)
A well done interview. Great Anupama👍
Sadly, you already knelt down &amp; let others control your life when you went under the knife &amp; then tried to hide behind &quot;temporary enhancement&quot; for the film, if that was the case why is your face still different? Truth is power, honesty is power; if you changed your face for your own happiness then you should have stood by your decision. But clearly you did it for other pressures that&#39;s why you tried to cover it up by saying u did it for a film. Ridiculous! Lost all respect for you after that!
More power to you girl!!
THIS GIRL IS ON FIRE! more power to u Ansushka...great interview, so insightful
YESSS!!! ANUSHKA!!!!! - SO HAPPY SHE CALLED OUT THE MEDIOCRITY IN INDIA!!!! THANK YOUUUUUUUUUUU
I love Anushka! Her acting is incredible, great interview with great questions! Enjoyed this 😊
thank you soo much Anushka for giving such a raw non diplomatic interview unlike most other actresses who shy away from this!
Anushka sharma !!!! You go girl . It is such an amazing feeling to hear 2 brilliant women have an intelligent and Important conversation . They are talking about things which matter . This makes me happy :)
What a confident, sensible young actor. More power to Anushka. Such role models are important especially in a male dominated soceity such as ours. And Anupama, you are a sensitive and marvelous interviewer.
my favourite
Absolutely fantastic to see a young professional who has her eyes and mind open and has it together in an insane industry. Anushka always keep it real &lt;3
Anushka is speaking well here n facts of life she is honest like my Inspiration Priyanka chopra
It was very interesting conversation. Well done anupama and anushka for being honest and amazing👍🏼
I love her!! You are Amazing!! lovely interview!!
It was absolutely delightful to watch such an honest and raw interview. As someone who identifies as a feminist and dearly loves bollywood and its art it&#39;s great to see it changing so dynamically and definitely for the better. Bye bye item numbers (what even are those things anyway?) and hello good content produced by great performers and story tellers.
Yeh kya F.C? Aap ko yehi actor milte he? get better actors for interviews
For all those who blatantly ask celebrities personal questions. This here is the perfect way to ask personal question without being intrusive. Good on you anupama!
The statement Anushka make about becoming a pawn is incredibly striking. We often don&#39;t realise the amount of pressure public figures are under to conform to expectations.
my favorite aushka us back
Anushka is such a brave..great interview..anupama great too
I really loved this conversation beautiful,confident and funny
she&#39;s just not very articulate.
