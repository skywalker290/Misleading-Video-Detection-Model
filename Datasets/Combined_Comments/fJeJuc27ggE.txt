Fast forward 6 years, Maraoane Fellaini, who has scored an amazing header in this match, has retired. Thank you for everything!
Felaini brilliant goal
How Genius is KDB !
Belgium to strong for all those teams.
I em happy for Belguim   BC  live in Belguim❤
Le meilleur match de la Coupe du Monde Belgique vs Japon
Well done 👍✅
アフリカの勝ち🎉

IF JAPAN QUALITY TO QF THEN I THINK BRAZIL REACH TO SEMI FINAL 😂

史上最高の試合
Ce soir-là, on a été se coucher fier de notre Belgique avec un sourire monstrueux
This is a curse. Never getting past the round of 16...

Every fighting of Japan even lost is still so impressive..
Negara jepang lagi. Kalah tipis namun menyakitkan bagi rakyatnya. Mengikuti jejaknya sendiri 2014 kalah telak 4 : 1  dari kolombia. 2018 <br>Kolombia kalah tipis 2 : 1 namun jepang kalah memalukan dan menyakitkan dari belgia 3 : 2 <br>Congrats belgia kalian tim tangguh
아직도 주기적으로 보러 오는 잊을 수 없는 명경기. 벨기에야 우승후보였지만 일본도 정말 대단했다. 4강은 갔었어야 했는데. 요즘 일본 수준 보면 아시아 최고이긴 한 듯. 정신력도 강함.
Best comeback of world cup 2018
この動画、30秒でやめちゃうんだよな。
Prime Hazard &lt;3
I felt every feeling during this match, sadness, annoyance, motivation, anger and above all happiness and relief. I cried so much during this match, at the end happy tears
The day I cried is this day.
I remember watching that Belgium counter attack live, it was the last action of the game and was just pure beauty how they made the comeback. Poor Japan deserved better they played very well but it was so unfortunate for them not to hold it until the end against a world class squad of Belgium.
One the best come back in World Cup history ❤

This is one of the most sad thrilling matches I&#39;ve ever seen!
Holy moly! Wat een geweldige wedstrijd in 2018!
Who’s comes here from facebook?  Same as me
Unforgettable match 2018 fifa world cup

悔しい、だが最高だった<br>ベルギーのスーパースターたちと互角に戦えたのは日本人として本当に光栄だった
Japan was like 2. World war
I THOUGHT Japan GONNA WIN THIS but Belgium beated japan 3-2
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=94">1:34</a> only one moment, when Lukaku didn&#39;t turn into Lakaka
One of the most attractive and forgettable football match in history.
Belgia ok 3=2
Japonia oooooooo =2222222
Congrats to Belgium for this remontda but I was so sad for Japan, they are so clooose but the luck is sooo horrible
What a match wow Belgium and Japan

Today&#39;s Japanese players are required to have decisiveness and a manager.
!BELGIUM GOOOOL JAPAN AND FRANCE FOOTBALL COME ENGLISH!
Japan-yamate kodassai💀

The match which set the stage for <b>BLUE LOCK</b>
What a game it was👏👏🤩
Who can forget this game 😯
It&#39;s hazard&#39;s prime time 🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=112">1:52</a>
and this is how the blue lock project was born
Lukaku, influencing everything without a single touch.
Japan goalkeeper trash lol he ruined the hard work done by the rest of the team
Lakaka
The only Asians teams left were Japan and Russia
We love you, Japan ♥️
경기 중반까지는 일본이 승리할 것 같았는데 벨기에 국가대표 선수들이 무서운 공격으로 단번에 3골을 넣어 역전승을 이루었을 때 정말 멋졌습니다. 끝까지 최선을 다한 양팀 모두 대단합니다.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=95">1:35</a> LUKAKU 🇧🇪🤣
This wasn&#39;t a football match , but an emotion
My favorite match on WC 2018👏
copa do mundo é copa d mundo nada n futebol é igual.
この頃のベルギーは何処へ😢
what was that?<br>Belgium have a incredible come back and defeat Japan 😯 <br>🇧🇪3-2🇯🇵
I really miss Belgium’s run in Russia 2018 I don’t know why they have been horrible in Qatar 2022
I&#39;m Belgian and i was born in Brussels in October 2001 and congrayulations to Belgium
&quot;Courtois is the best goalkeeper&quot;
01 July 2002
I wanted japen to win :(
This true was the golden generation of Belgium
Surely has to be one of the best if not the best game in entire world cup history ....
Love from India🇮🇳❤️🇮🇳
as an indian i was supporting japan in this match wish someday india could also comeup with the legends like sunil chettri on the feild
2点取って調子に乗ってたのでは？
This was such a crushing defeat to watch live
japanese players are so much shorter.. they are in so much disadvantage in headers
일본은 앞으로 우승도 가능할듯
Before bluelock project
The best reverse sweep
👍👍👌👌
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=87">1:27</a> Team Japan would never expect Courtois would pass the ball to De Bruyne, neither would anybody else.
A storming second-half fightback from Belgium!!!
Announcers should pronounce last names of players properly - not like the British female announcer on Fox before who butchered Japanese last names
Fifa 2022 seems a bit fishy after watching all these matches spanning over the years!!!
負けたけど、めっちゃいい試合だった。
Since they did this, I&#39;ve been a fan of them since. This game was one of the most intense games I&#39;ve ever watched
🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪
vertongen header is an absolute miracle.. 😭😭😭 how is he even able to aim so well ? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=53">0:53</a>

2002<br>Jul 2
Another heartbreak today😢
Very sad to see Japan lose like this again to Croatia. It seem with all odds, Croatia remains unbeaten for now through penalties. I hope Japan comes back from this 💪.
Japan<br>This is your time
What happened for Croatia in Qatar 2022??? 🤣🤣🤣
決勝トーナメントで再戦できる可能性もあったから、ベルギー敗退は残念
Vertonghen&#39;s header was difficulty off the charts (the ball was so high up and the open area was so small)
この頃のワールドカップのハイライトの再生数ヤバ
I am here after Lukaku’s disaster class in 2022 😀
Who&#39;s here after Belgium has been eliminated
Japan in WC 2022 will definitely win from Belgium.
この試合の動揺、困惑、絶望。全てを晴らす為の権利を遂に得た。日本なら出来る。4年前の悔しさ絶対晴らす為に、死ぬ気で応援する。頑張れ日本！！！！！！！🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
As a Belgian I would have dreamed of a rematch against Japan. If only Lukaku had scores against Croatia...
Only because they are European thats make them win against japan not because of skill, they are just higher😂
Despair
Doesn’t matter they destroyed Germany anyway🔥🎌😹
This game ripped out my heart  😞  Keisuke Honda&#39;s last ride

日本がリードしている試合はいつもこの試合のことを思い出す。
I felt so bad for Japan, but that 3rd goal was the most beautiful counterattack I&#39;ve ever seen
Here is the winner
After this game 4 years in blue lock and  the result 1st place in Group stage against Spain Germany and Costa Rica
Hello Everyone. LORD LUKAKA and JAPAN&#39;S 4 YEAR CHALLENGE.
Even though I&#39;m Argentinean, I remember watching this game back in 2018, as I love Japan, and it was all I could think of during today&#39;s match. It&#39;s a shame the video doesn&#39;t show the timer; Belgium&#39;s third goal came at the <b>94&#39;</b> mark. I&#39;m very happy Japan finally made it to the Round of 16.<br><br>That ball was out though.
This game you can see, that you shouldn‘t underestimate Japan. That’s why Germany and Spain lost.
Watching this as the sun sets on this golden generation 🥲 3rd place wasn&#39;t too shabby at least
Anybody knows the name of the commentator?
back when belgium was united
馬鹿試合（誉め言葉）
if Brazil did not lose to Belgium, maybe the final match will bring together France and Brazil and the final will be interesting .
What a comeback
boy do I miss this belgian form....
Me
今の高齢化で衰えたベルギーは悲しいなぁ
旭日旗は置いて、韓国と日本の未来のために協力する姿が必要です。 旭日旗はドイツのハーケンクロイツ旗と同じ意味です。 日本の繁栄を象徴するとはいえ、内部的に応援するには象徴性があるかもしれませんが、周辺国との協力には良くありません。 どうか、日本の未来のためにも過去の過ちを晴らしてください。
I really hope Japan makes it to knockouts this year, but its looking difficult.
Japan should have won this.  Poor goalkeeping cost them the match.  No way that first Belgium goal should have gone in
Who&#39;s here after Costa Rica choked Japan 😂😂
Japan lost not to Belgium but the physicality. Belgium coach took a smart step putting taller player to the pitch. There is no way japanese defender could cope with the attacker 6-8 inch taller.
今回も決勝トーナメントでベルギーと当たりそう😢
Japanese first 2-0 and belgium 3-2🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅
I am now from 2022 and Japan beat Italy 2.1😂😂
こんな興奮した試合も絶望した試合もなかった笑笑
One of the greatest come back of Belgium in world cup. What a class performance even in the last minute👏 2022 Qatar world cup I am rooting for Belgium again this year
敵ながらベルギーの3点目はほんとに美しいゴールでした。悔しいけどやっぱりベルギー強かった🇧🇪🇧🇪

We are ready to fight Belgium again.  The soul of the blue samurai is not yet dead.
This is what inspired Blue Lock

Bekaar match aaaa thu
This has to be the greatest comeback in football history
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best football match in the history
Japan delivered the performance of a lifetime
This game you can see, that you shouldn‘t underestimate Japan. That’s why Germany lost.
Still one of the best match in World Cup 🤯
Japan is definitely great team!
The greatest team of all time.... unlucky to be loosing to France

Japan is the Asian superpower in football.
What a match
Japan had skill not luck in this time.<br>Today, they certified it.(2022/11/23)
やっぱ原点はこれだよな
この雪辱から新しい風を取り入れて強くなった侍ジャパン🇯🇵

4 years later, Japan won the game 2-1 against Germany.
Japan has finally avenged this painful loss after their 1-2 come from behind win against Germany.
What a loss
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=54">0:54</a> the defender should remember this moment for his life.
Pain
Our golden team😞
I remember vividly, when courtois caught that ball, I knew it was a goal for some reason. Everyone in the stands went wild. It was surreal
choke ever
This is one of the thrilling matches in the History of Football, I have ever seen.
Japan had speed but less stamina they couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace
and then...Blue Lock was created
Japan were so close, hope they can repeat some time.
Love Belgium
Courtois passing the ball and Belgium winning is so epic
I had seen death note recently and was listening to its music during this match. I vividly remember listening to the end credits song, it was almost a full moon. I was rooting for Japan to win. I was rooting for the underdog. It almost happened till the end where the result was quickly altered.<br><br>I often come here to watch this epic match&#39;s highlights since then. Tomorrow the next world cup begins. It&#39;s been four years; time flies.
That vertoghen goal i dont  believe how it get in absolutely amazing header
at the last act Belgium gave them the business

Japan lost this game bcs they are short<br>Believe it or not
all the japan plays and goals give me goosebumps, their fans are really passionate too. this match makes me really want to like japan
2010はPK負けでベスト16<br>2014は最高の状態でグループリーグ敗退<br>2018は逆転負けでベスト16<br>日本に何が足りないのか、まだ分からない<br>2022はどうなることやら
I experienced the best and the worst moments in my life at this game
Respect to Japan, fought their hearts out
how many of us are here after reading or watching blue lock?
日本めちゃくちゃ褒められてて嬉しいんだがwありがとねぇ
at least we got blue lock out of this match
Japan should&#39;ve parked the bus, they didn&#39;t. Belgium responded.
So proud to be Belgian ! We know we won this cup ❤
belgium should just lose
Can I use these video clips
বেলজিয়াম শালারা
Lukaku played a crucial role in the third goal without even a touch on the ball. All the free spaces in Japan defence was created by him if you notice.
what a match it was.. Belgium team was down 0-2 down in first half totally under pressure..<br>The 2nd half saw a different belgium team taking advantage of shorter Japanese players through putting in air ball in the D box to score.<br>In the 2nd half  poor japanese team was no match before them..
sayang bgt musuhnya belgia andai musuhmu indonesia bs menang 10 : 0 pang jepang
As a neutral, the ending to this game was painful. Japan played so well and were clearly the underdog in this game. Had they won this game nobody could say they didn&#39;t deserve it. I also like that there was no dirty play or anything that required VAR just pure football from beginning to end.
<b>This country needs a Blue Lock Project.</b>
Ed è proprio da questa partita che inizia il blue lock
They had us in the first half ngl
Hands down the best game of 2018 worldcup.
Thanks Belgium for being the caused of the best sport anime ever.
Japan is a excellent team but Belgium is the undeafeatable gamechanger.
Who&#39;s here because of Blue Lock.
I forgot this Mach but the first when I read blue lock manga I remember it 😂 ..
Blu lock histori
2022
as a big belgium fan big respect to japan for continuing to play the game, simply the best game ever
ngl best game ever
悔しすぎる…。😢
I want to beat Belgium in Qatar&#39;s final tournament!!<br>To do that, we have to beat Germany or Spain in Group E!!
How blue lock made
I really love watching Japan play, I want them to do well against both Germany and Spain
That counterattack reminded me to the blitzkrieg
Who this commentator? Does anyone who his name?
best gamer ever. nothing is impossible
Lukaku so selfless assist there
So hyped for November
Man its been 4 years now
As a moroccan i will say to belgium see u next november : &quot;we will f**ck u&quot; 🇲🇦👉🏻👌🏻🇧🇪

この試合はマジで悔しかった
I feel so sad for japan.
The japanese was on fire
I am very surprised Japan could hold up this much with Belgium. They both played a wonderful match. Japan should be able to  get further in the future at this rate
This still haunts me to this day. As a japanese i officailly announce that i thre the remote at my screen and it cracked.
Japan deserved to go in to the quater Final.

Thank you for the video. Can I download the videos uploaded on the FIFA channel and upload them on my YouTube channel?
Japan could beat Belgium for 2-0 asif Korea beat Germany for 2-0
What a fake by Lukaku
What everyone expect from a football match.
Nice match
Belgium tryhard mode be like:

japan gk should never play football ever again.
Japan vs Germany and Spain in Qatar 2022 🤣
Love you Japan from Bangladesh ❤️❤️❤️
Actually Japan did their best. Many people said Japan had to play defensive after 2 goals, however attacking was the best Defending for Japanese team on that match since Belgium was way stronger team and  they have much taller players.  If you watched the game fully you can found that Japan played so well on this game but also they got lucky as well.
M
best 8...
4 years ago…. As a belgium i will never forget this
I can’t believe I’m here in the same day before it turns into 4 years ago
It is been 4 years ago for best remontda ever
This is me when I made my year at college💗😆
Like for japan
So sorry to Japan
I don’t know why I watch soccer now if I hate soccer
Iran level with protugal , japan almost beat belgium , korea beat germany , saudiarab beat egypt
One of the best football matches I&#39;ve ever seen in my whole life.
That third goal!<br>This is why I love counterattacks..🔥
Okay But This Time Japan Will Win World Cup
I did bet around 1000 euro for Belgium
What a game!! I remember this one like it was yesterday, rooting all the way since the start of the tournament for Belgium. What a shame though that the manager played KDB deep vs France for most of the match
আমি জাপান
Nhật đã chơi hay
For Japanese, this match is nightmare. But also, this is the best match I&#39;ve ever watched.
Belgium the best
3:2
European football team use techic because all they score from heading ball benefit of tall players any way they used really nice tactic in the end
bro blue lock will do a wonderful work in 2022
Japan is best.
One of those games whether you know the result or not, you love watching over and over
Belgium&#39;s entire team pretty much do or did play in England. Kinda interesting
Korea vs Germany and this match is the interesting one
Germany and Spain never think they can easily beat Japan in the World Cup.<br>Of course, both countries have a history of football more than Japan, and the results they have left are amazing.　However, Japan is definitely stronger than Russia and South Korea at the time of 2018.
The  Vertonghen   goal  can be  easily avoidable  japan  made  a  mistake  was  there
They should&#39;ve parked the bus
Notice how low that ball stayed the whole time in the counter attack
Japan was better
cmon belgium55555
Single ethnicity🇯🇵 vs. multi-ethnicity🇧🇪
What am I saying I thought Japan was going to win
I thought patrician
That was a very cool
heartbraking
How can Japan ever win in a match with Belgium? There&#39;s no way. No Asian country will ever win a world cup.
Thanks to South Korea 2002 with corrupted referees. VAR was born 🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=16">0:16</a>
I watched this game over. If Japan had played counter attack they would have won. Their open style hurt them in the last 25 mins
Still searching and watching this clip in 2022 june..... beautiful match so far.... awesome play
Belgique est le meilleur
What it remarkable comeback<br>Belgium 0-2 Japan but for now<br>Belgium 3-2 Japan Belgium has 3 goals to win
I was rooting for Japan this was a great match I hope they will so even better in Qatar!
This is a game that Japan will never forget.<br>How they managed to get 2 goals past Courtois is a mystery to this day.
was a fire match
The last minute goal🔥🔥🔥
What a comeback!

This match is the visual representation of the fact that height does matter.
한국인으로서 A매치가 일본이랑 걸리면 최고의 적대관계인 나라이지만 스포츠매너만큼은 일본을 욕할순 없다 나는 이때 벨기에를  우승 후보로 생각했기에 일본을 칭찬한다
It&#39;s too sad to see a large hoped team lost 😞
Em chơi hay quá

The trully drama when the king of asia finally lose their win
Lukaku was everything in that final goal ...2 decoy runs  that sealed the fate of japan
Amazing game
I couldn&#39;t stand up when the game was over... It was really tough to go to work that day...Japan was 5AM then.
could have won a lot of money that day....
2 Belgian born Moroccans that at some point represented morocco score the winning goals. How great is that we meet each other in group F this year
最後オフサイド
I still feel Hazard deserved the golden ball more than Modric
That vertonghen header is one of the most odd, satisfying and amazing goals i’ve ever seen.
Japan deserved to win
Japan is the best team in Asia and Japan is definitely way better than South Korea. Much respect for Japan from France 🇯🇵🇫🇷
Despite losing, hats off to Japan. They had an amazing world cup

Respect for Japan
This is how you play a game, you don&#39;t just sit back and take strike after strike, you try to get more! You played great Japan!
For the fair Belgium won Japan

Belgium&#39;s Next Match is Equal to Courtois Carrier I mean only that match he was perfect Goalkeeper 😑And when he came to Otherside of Madrid we shouldn&#39;t talk we all knows
Nacer Last Minute Goal will always be in Opening of Belgium&#39;s Football and FIFA world Cup Opening seen Marci Chadli <br><br>😅 De Bryune Taking ball from  Courtois is Unbelievable I guess he forgiven him
ありがとう
if only japan wins
🔥🔥🔥
Uno de los mejores partidos que he visto en mundiales.
best soccer match in the last 4 years
One of the saddest World Cup games in the recent history.
I support both team..but Belgium counter attack is best..❤❤
일본이 반드시 독일을 이기길 바란다.
Belgium tactics is : high balls and perfect crosses beacuse japan players hieght
I wish Japan won tbh, they deserved it more 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🤝🇯🇵
They should have parked the bus and play defense. That coach of Japan should have been fired after the game.
I was so sad for japan. They just crumbled on defence everytime.
It is not Belgium who won, but the Arabs! Shazly Filali are Arabs!! Arab players always give victory to Belgium and France
اليابان لعبت افضل واليابان  من تستحق الفوز
아시아라서 응원했는데 아쉽다
As a fellow asian i will root for japan in 2022 wc as well
Just take a look on Chadli run in the third goal
Belgium just spamming crosses to Fellaini.  So average.
And here we are.... Japan and Belgium might have a rematch in 2022..... If in the smallest chance Japan makes it out of the Group Stage
I&#39;m sorry for Japan for losing to Belgium 2-3 but I congratulate Belgium on winning the World Championship qualifiers
so this is why blue lock was made
アザールやルカクが今の調子で対戦してたらなとか考えてしまう。14年のハメスもそうだった。日本はもしかすると運がないのかもしれない
負けて悔しいけど、これ以上の試合はなかった。2018W杯の中で一番好きな試合だよ。負けたけど…<br>ベルギーは本当に素晴らしいチームだった<br>日本人だけどベルギーを愛してるよ<br>いつか行ってみたいものだ<br>🇯🇵🇧🇪❤️
الهدف الثالث لبلجيكا  ...هبطه مقوده
Such a shame Japan didn&#39;t win. Respect from the Netherlands!
The last of thee amazing Eden hazard
Yay Japan lose I am korean
Japan until 2-0: It&#39;s like a dream!<br>Japan by 2 - 3: This must be a dream.
Lukaku right 👍
最後のカウンター見るたびに俺たちは嫌な思い出をまた味わわなきゃいけないのか

Japan really made whole Asia proud.<br> Asia should learn from them.<br>🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵 🎌🎌🎌🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
🙏
🇯🇵..🇯🇵..🇯🇵... rising star of Asia
Japan here we go to WORLD CUP😊
アザール、デブルイネ、ルカク、クルトワといった言わずと知れたスーパースターたちをかなり苦しめてた。今年もこういう素晴らしいゲームを見せてほしいな
I&#39;m Japanese, but it was a pity that Belgium lost to France rather than Japan lost to Belgium.
dope match
솔직히 일본은 이 정도이면 축구 매우 잘한거임.하지만 그럼에도 불구하고 지금 이 경기에서 일본이 벨기에 에게 지는 이유가 아마 피지컬 때문에 졌을거라고 생각한다.<br>내가 지금까지 월드컵 , 유로컵등 전부 보면서 느낀것이 유럽애들 공통점은 피지컬이 훨씬 뛰어난다는것임 아시아인들보다 <br>예를들어 키 그리고 몸 다리 발 허벅지 등등...<br><br>만약에 일본이 유럽사람처럼 피지컬이 좋았다면 이 경기는 일본이 앞도적으로 승리했다고 생각한다.
この時の屈辱を晴らせ日本
🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
🤣
Gran remontada de los belgas
Any Blue Lock fam here?
Soooooo sad
Kak Febri dan kak Edward merayakan gol Rizki menit 48 Fateh menit 52 gawang Belgia 16 besar piala dunia 2018 kak febri dan kak Edward gagal mengatakan anak asuhnya lolos quroter final Rizki dan jason dan teman-temannya sudah tersingkir kalahkan 2-3 dari Belgia
Japan not only didn&#39;t defend but also stopped attacking when Belgium was getting aggressive... So it seems more like Belgium just underestimated them in first half
.
one of the most dramatic games ever.
Japon merecia ganar ese partido:(
bad japan battar
What a comeback
Crazyyyyyy I remember this like yesterday
Japan should play defence
속시원하다 ㅋㅋ
nice 👍<br>Japan 👎
Who&#39;s this commentator?
玉砕！無念なり！
Fact is, they scored more goals then France played against belgium
🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪  was gonna win
I really don&#39;t understand how this last goal ended up on goal of the tournament
Wow what amazing performance to both sides but dang i really feel bad to Japan
Soccer isn’t my favourite sport but this match between Belgium the men in red and Japan the men in blue was just pure gold
Infantino, you are Putin&#39;s friend. This is a great shame for you and FIFA! You are putting your hand to a great crime against humanity. This is not soccer! You are ruled by unclear interests and dirty blood-stained innocent people murdered at the behest of your friend Putin!

One of the most very best comeback in world cup history
Love You My Favorite Team Love From Bangladesh🇧🇩 💖🇧🇪😘
WHAT A GAME, que gran partido 😮💯👌
Sayang sekali,padahal jepang udah mau lolos ke 8 besar dari tim negara asia
Kevin de Bryune passing so awsome👍💪
Japanese team always had subpar goalkeepers in history, if they can find a half-decent goalkeeper and a solid striker, they can go much further.
I&#39;ve never seen any polite people than Japanese 🇯🇵
The best game I ever watched live
time for de bruyne to lead this attack⚽
🇧🇪🎌
日本最強！
Japan lost because they had REVERSE ANIME POWER UP effect<br>Had they been trailing They would have won
Japan lost because they had REVERSE ANIME POWER UP effect<br>Had they been trailing They would have won
정말 강하다 일본.황금세대 벨기에와 정면으로 맞붙어서 대적가능한 아시아 팀은 사실상 일본밖에 없음.게다가 수비만 하는게 아니라 주도적인 운영으로 경기를 가져갈뻔했다는게 대단하네 인정한다
Japan will be dangerous in this year World Cup ( if they qualify) they caught the number 1 team off guard
Can i just say that this World Cup was amazing
Epic Comeback
ここでとった2点は日本サッカーの大きな希望になって、後にとられた3点は日本サッカーの大きな課題になった。<br>この1試合の価値は日本サッカーにとってかなり重要なものだったと思う。
Japan did mistake, they should have made a foul instead try to play clean to stop it for the winning goal for Belgium
🇧🇪 ⚽⚽⚽ X ⚽⚽ 🇯🇵.
Belgium struggled this game.
Loser Japan😂😂
aowkaowk di comeback
ベルギー🇧🇪マジで強かったし好きなチーム！<br>カタールでもし対戦あったらリベンジしてやる🥺
ウイニングランとまではいかないけど、守備への切り替えが日本の最大の課題１９９３～　中盤にすぐに守備的MF入れればよかったかも　(^▽^;)
LoL..... 🤣
This was the superb team game Japan vs Belgium.💞💜💞💜
As some one Japanese it’s devastating
勝ったと思ったのに
Belgium is bettr0
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=90">1:30</a> look at the Japanese player in front of the Belgium player, this defense does anything!!
ほんま悲しかったな
Japan😂😂😂😂
Last goal was so smooth
What a goal fellaini scored here and against france
A great match
Asian team 👎👎👎👎👎🤣🤣
Best game in the tournament 🔥🔥
Still the best match of all time. Rooting for Japan but great game Belgium.
Japan played great and they deserve to be commended!!
Felt sad for Japan
Felaini gei &gt;:V

Came back to watch because of the anime &quot;Blue Lock&quot;.
epic comeback
ベルギーが強すぎた。香川真司のプレー大好き
I can stop watching this<br><br><br>🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿
cool.
The fact that I’m half Belgian and I love Japan , it’s hard to chose a side
Japan 🗾 asian 💪
What a comeback for belgium!! Top notch
No diving, no whining, no cards, no cheating from both teams. Football can be a freaking beautiful game.
Im half Japanese and this broke my heart
Orang-orang Asia gak bakalan bisa jadi sepak bola terhebat
Maen Badminton aja orang Asia..mah..kasih bola tinggi depan gawang lamaaaa jebol juga..😂✌
thrilling match
🥲
⚡️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=23">0:23</a>　I am Japanese. OK, I&#39;m back.
Best Match Ever...
the most important part of the counter attack was lukaku leaving the ball for Chadli.
Wow <br>Respect is 🇧🇪
🔥
Percayalan beberapa saat kemudian, negara yang dibagian Asia akan menjuarai Fifa World Cup
Futebol tb é tática, algo que a seleção japonesa não teve, pois deveria se defender, retrancar o time. O importante não é jogar bonito e sim ser vitorioso.<br>Saudações do Brasil.
Belgium are amazing I hope they win the world cup final or atleast make it to finals or semi finals 🇧🇪 and for Japan better luck next time love you from jordan🇯🇴♥️🇧🇪
What A Comeback From Belgium
Wow
WHAT. A. GAME
I predicted that moment
Congrats to Belgium, love from Qatar
Japan is really improving
Great match
Loser
何回でも見ちゃうな、見る度に吐き気するけど
My motivation match, look at the last Goal is 💪 tremendous
They should made a statute of lukaku in Belgium for the great assist he made.
I still remembered this today Japan almost win but unfortunately Belgium take the lead.
EPIC COMEBACK
love japan
One of the best game in footballing history
that last belgian goal was a practice drill.......
miao
Crazy Match
Respect to Japan
El fútbol es para vivos y los ponjas pecaron de inocentes y trataron de jugar siempre a lo correcto
♥️ GLORIA A DIOS ♥️🙏.
On this day, I cried for the first time in soccer.<br><br>from japan🇯🇵
Japan is best asian team  they have some skills
BELGIUM🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪❤️
Worst goalkeeper from Japan
My heart breaks into pieces when Chadli scores, but Japan earned everyone&#39;s respect at this World Cup including me.
I saw this match in live.epic match it was.this is called football.anything can happenat any time.both Japan and beligium gave their total best to win🔥.but special mention is lukaku&#39;s leave.thats genius presence of mind🔥
Whenever I feel sad for Japan watching this, I watch Wales beating Belgium at euro 2016 to cheer myself up.
123🇧🇪🙂
That last goal👌💞🚩⚽🔥🔥🔥
Japan brought us som real entertainment
Best game of the World Cup!!
Bélgica es impresionante se merecía 1ue ganará la FIFA WORLD CUP , aunque os goles de INUI no estuvo mal
Prime Belguim, i miss it
この最強メンバーのベルギー相手に2点取ったチームは日本とチュニジアだけやから誇って良いと思う。<br>そして世界の広さを改めて思い知らされた一戦
This is the real thrill of sports
This WC was crazy. I can&#39;t wait for next one. I wish Poland will be there too (but propably they will lose with Russia, you know, politics).
<b>JAPAN NO.1 ASIA!!! 🇻🇳❤🇯🇵</b>
That heading goal should not have happenned
Now I think Japan deserved the win 🇮🇷
The best match cup! Japan in the next cup go champion!
Me after 3 yrs 😅

Japan thought they would pull a Inazuma Eleven on Belgium
I felt very proud of Japan at that night. What a night!!! I&#39;m not even a japanese
Asian team never go to quarter final😅
Always come here once a while to smile 😊
My respect for Japanese team.
One of the best World Cup matches ever !
On a eu du cul !
This match defines RESILIENCE
ฟุลบอลอะไรก็ไม่แน่นอน/ต่อให้คุณนำ3-0ก็อย่าพึ่งดีใจ/เพราะเขาจะไล่แชงจนได้ชนะ4-3ก็เห็นมาเยอะ
Who is watching this masterpiece 11/11/2021🥰
After first half:<br>Japan: haha easy win<br>Belgium: I dont think so
CÓ AI NGƯỜI VIỆT NAM KHÔNG ?
Perfect commentary puts some extra icing to this.

日本は2022年のW杯にでれないかもしれません。
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=87">1:27</a> Hazard couldn&#39;t even follow Nacer :-))))))

Which commutator is this
この試合は今思い出しても悔しいけど、日本代表史上WCで1番最高の試合だった。
Belgium won the match but Japan won hearts
Football is a beautiful game.
Dava pro Japão. Esse era o jogo... Na real mesmo, estava tão perto de chegar num lugar mais alto nessa copa. Esse time do Japão era muito bom, mas vacilou demais também
wow
bien malos son
GO JAPAN WIN
did not deserve defeat Japan 🇯🇵 😭 greetings from Somalia 🇸🇴
japan blew this one up 2-0
no kicks and punches like Korean
Japanese played very well respect Japan and Belgium
Nations League 2020/21: Belgium got from France what it did to Japan 3 years before LOL
Vertongan&#39;s header is the best header I&#39;ve ever seen my entire life
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=84">1:24</a> que contra-ataque do caramba!

America first, but Belgium is my 2nd. I will never forget this game

Courtois must be given more appreciation for that quick reaction and pass for that last goal.
Sometime karma gonna happen lol .. and the blue team was france this time 🤣
Fellaini saved us so many times man should get more respect
Amazing match from losing to winning in the last minute. Congrats Belgium!
jlkkjlk
2018 : 🇧🇪 3-2 🇯🇵<br>Japan were 2-0 ahead, Belgium made a incredible comeback to defeat Japan 3-2. Japan lost in heartbreaking fashion. <br><br>2021 : 🇧🇪 2-3 🇫🇷<br>Belgium were 2-0 ahead, France made a incredible comeback to defeat Belgium 3-2.

Here after Belgium 2-3 France Nations League Semi-Final.
This is sad tbh
2018 - Belgium Comeback on World Cup 3-2 vs Japan<br>2021 - Belgium Lost after Comeback France in Semi Finał Narodów Ligi
france - belgium game of october 7th 2021 is quite similar to this
time 800 I&#39;ve watched this as a Belgian and boy that lukaku step-over still gives me goosebumps
beautiful match
the best game in football history💐🇧🇪
한국인 엄지척
スポーツで涙を流したのはこれが初めてだった
That was an amazing comeback, but man it was heartbreaking. <br>My place went silent at the Belgium&#39;s third goal.
Japanese people celebrating goals of Belgium 😌
The best match of the tournament aside from France vs Argentina tbh
Lukaku finish japan 😂😂😂
&quot;There is just time for De Bruyne to lead this attack&quot; If I was Kevin, I&#39;d be proud of myself after hearing this in a World Cup game.
Trận này căng thật
BELGIUM YES YES YES
So this is why blue lock was made
gg Belgium and gg Japan!
Japan dropped the ball harder then WW2 xD
3 _2
❤️ belgian
❤️
FINAL GOAL: Mesmerizing to see Shoji on a DEAD RUN from the instant Courtois releases his throw until Chadli directs it home ... all that hustle and he was one step short.
Best match comeback
I rewatch these highlights every year. How did Japan throw away a 2-0 lead with about 15 mins to go? WHY did they not just play a short corner at the end and keep hold of it? An exciting game but Japan really threw it away.
この時はマジ悔しかった
FIFA 2018 best comeback ever
This match captivated the world.  Japanese soccer was great.  Belgian counters are first-class.  Anyone can see it.  It ’s truly world class
most love game
世界ランキング１桁の底力と一瞬のギアチェンジですね
Que  virada sensacional gol no último Segundo
This is why I love football, anything can happen at any time
I’m Belgian &amp; I feel bad for Japan
Respect for both of them!
Japan is Asia Tiger.
Jan vertoghen
What a asian nation🥰🥰 we will conquer one day😍 Ins hallah
De Bruyne&#39;s role in the counterattack is so underrated. Collecting the ball from the man who stole his girl and running halfway through the pitch with blistering pace, then laying down that scrumptious outside the foot pass
One of the best match
Olympic, soccer , basketball, gaming   hi-tec, why&#39;s allways japan in it ?
Jappan 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Japan should not have sent so many players forward for the last corner kick...
%%^
I think this is the most beautiful counter in football history from Japan👏👏👏👏
Never ever it&#39;s the best match
Nooooo japan
Blue Lock
Everything about this match was simply awesome including commentary
I still get chickenvel if I kijk this again
ほんとに夢見させてもらいました<br>来年も頑張ってください<br>応援してます

If this match doesn’t tell you “never give up “ I don’t know what will 👌👌👌
Almost killed the giants.....<br>Next time japan ❤️.
Japan keep attacking and weaken their defense even after 2 goal. Big mistake.
Can’t believe this happens 3 years ago time flys
Japan we&#39;re underrated they literally almost defeated one of the best contender for the cup
Ven super campeones
Belgium to Japan: OMOE WA SHINDEIRU.<br>Japan: Nani?!!?
Ngl Japan played better than Brazil on the World Cup. Is just the defense that sucks
From the moment courtois gave it to debruyne ,you feld already that there&#39;s going to happen something.. That attack,that vision..wonderful goal.<br>Endless respect for japan for keep playing soccer and not parking the bus.<br>Best attack in wc history!!
Vertonghen header is so underrated
Japan 2nd goal 👍
Same as Costa Rica
惜しかったな😢
Japan got too relaxed after that corner 😌😌😌
If Japan beaten Belgium, Japan could go to semi finals in their first time in history.
Japan should win this match because they deserve it..
Beautiful
Awesome come back and you know Kevin  actually send me a message
it so fun watching old world cup highlights
VOOR VORST VOOR HEILIG EN VOOR RECHT RETEKETET
Slow and steaty wins the race!

勝っても記憶に残らない試合もあれば、負けても記憶に残り続ける試合もある。この死闘は後世語り継がれる試合で、この瞬間を目の当たりにできたことに幸せを感じます。
BEST GAME IN 2018
Tehnik ancaman ini guys
If Belgium 🇧🇪 would have lost to Japan,that would shock the world
🇧🇪 3 - 2 🇯🇵
One of the best games of the tournament!!!
Yoooo that last attack gave me chills.. attack mode all the way ..unruly
Japan shouldn&#39;t keep the goalkeeper to the knockout stage. His reflex was too slow, most of the loses was his faults as well
次のカタール大会に期待だけど、毎回日本が前評判が高いときになぜかグループリーグ敗退するんだよな,,,,,
Lukaku &amp; fellani❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When life was better 🥲
comeback
What a comeback from Belgium 🤯🤯
Next year, i want to see Asian team at the top of the group and winning the world cup
Para mi esta es la remontada mas historica
Bro they almost won
Belgium is never easy the counter strike of them has made the biggest team&#39;s of the world cry 🇧🇩🤍🇧🇪
Really it&#39;s a great match.
🖤💛❤
Love Japan! Love Belgium! Love football especially the world cup! Love Sport! This was such a beautiful game that produced the best kind of drama: Respect to both teams!
This was one of the historical match in FIFA 2018..!
Best 2nd Half 😂
Woulda been so cool if Japan won 😔
Well done Belgium!!
Vertonghen made a mistake in this game and didn’t clear the ball against Italy leading up to the goals.
Yes belgium won
best game of Belgium&#39;s history
Great great game. Glad to see them in the Olympics
As a Belgium supporter, I totally respect the Japan&#39;s football and I hope they can be a strong team in the future because they have the potential! <br>WHAT A MATCH
美しいカウンターでした
This defeat will make Japan stronger again🇯🇵
Que mala defensa tienen los chinos Kjjjj
Proud to be japan for Wel played congratulations to Belgium
Only one asian team who is fighting there l love japan from india.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=24">0:24</a> Kevin just chilling lol
Rooted for Japan after Mexico got clapped just for them to choke
Japan really played a fair match, but Belgium did an insane comeback<br>I respect both teams
Playing with high ball does the trick in Second half for belgium.. And here comes the super Head man.. Felaini 😂🤣👍
Respect+ for japan
It was foolish from japan to not play defense
After a 2-0 lead. I’d definitely be seeing my team in the quarter final. Too bad it was taken away
Wish i had bet on Belgium after Japan was in Lead 2:0 😲🤑
I come back to watch this every now and then and each time I do, it&#39;s all goosebumps 🥶
It was one of the greatest matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Finals. Belgium 🇧🇪 &amp; Japan 🇯🇵 played a match for the ages.
Dude vertohngen scored 69 MIN?????
Top 10 tragic anime deaths.
Belgium is in top 3 teams of FIFA rankings since 6 years.<br>So underrated. My support to them in WC 2022.<br>❤️ from India
Japan goalkeeper
Belgium barely squeak by as usual like their game vs Portugal score one goal and then survive an absolute onslaught for 90 minutes
🇧🇪 - 3  vs 🇯🇵 - 2.      Kyen de  bryen
Lukaku was astonishing in this match!
Japan Goal keeper didnt use anime flashbacks thats why they didnt win
That day i really wished Japan would win....
JAPAN GOALKEEPER POOR

It was a beutifull game  ever
Can&#39;t wait fifa world cup 2022,because japan have new player,kubo and minamino
この試合を見ると絶対に泣いてしまう
That last minute counter attack has to be one of the best in football history.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=95">1:35</a> Shivers. Absolute shivers.
Japani boys have short height so they have some limitations. If they remain similar to all other nations, they might have a real chance to win world cup. 😔
To be fair, credit to Japan. Not only did they finish 2nd out of Poland,Colombia and Senegal. They scored 2 goals against Belgium who were one of the best teams in this competition.
You gotta feel bad for Japan
Best match of the tournament
JAPAN
still remember that day, I supported Belgium😊<br>lost hopes till the 60th minute but after that they rocked🔥 this was one of the best comebacks I&#39;ve ever seen
Hats off to Number 3....
A beautiful game of Football ❤️ Probably the best match of the tournament. Love from Pakistan
Pas mérité pay de fraude
If anime football character,s are real than Japan will win
Best football match I ever seen.. great respect for Japan 🇯🇵.. love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩.
Partidazo
No joking i am Belgian but this is remaining in my memory for ever and ever .  We played way better then then we did in 2021 EC cup , we deserved our cup there , only France did get in our way . I do believe we were at least equal to France , just part of luck on their side. IMHO in EC we did not stand a chance , not against Italy , but also , not against Portugal ( which we won by luck ) . 2018 was the best we ever got , and it will take long long time before we will get that quality back .
If japan won Brazil would have won quarterfinals
One of best match match, most surprising
Have to feel for Japan - heart breaking for them, but that Belgian winner was a masterpiece.
Lukaku leave is the best thing see in goal
One of the greatest comebacks
I watch this match lot of times<br>What a surprise
Japan is the most underated national soccer team.
As a asian i got hurt in the last. Japan should have been defensive after scoring 2 goals
Familiar scoreline, but this time we can&#39;t come back 😭😭😭😭, Belgium aren&#39;t the same when kompany and fellaini is gone after all.
Chadli sus 😂
7月3日のベルギー相手に2-0なんて盛り上がる要素しかなかったけど<br>日本と違ってイタリアは甘くなかったなｗ
Anyone here after belgium got knocked out of euro 2020?
Watching while belgium are down 2-1 against italy in quater finals in euro 2020 we need another comeback
It&#39;s a disastrous game for Japan.
vertonghen just keeping calm even though he got a brilliant goal
This painful day has come again this year
🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
Was not inazuma eleven, sorry
The best comeback
Takashi inui shot always like that
2点取った後から見るのが地獄だw
That Japan goal keaper need to improve
3 years later still heartbreaking
If japan had a taller keeper they would have had more of a chance
That was best mach play
朝早起きしてみる価値はあったなぁ<br>今となっては懐かしい
japan may have played very well, but their players were very short. no wonder how belgium scored 2 headers so quick.
I love this match
belge is trash
Se o japao tivesse passado o brasil tinha avançado por o japao é fregues do brasil
Jav the best
BELGIUM BELGIUM
It is Belgium...
It was a disappointing result as a Japanese, but I enjoyed it very much as a football fan！
Japan&#39;s up to great things in the world cups to come. Great playing, amazing fans.
As someone relatively new to football, this is the best match i ever watched live. Why can&#39;t every match be like this. Just two teams giving it their all. No backhanded tackling or injuring eachother. Both sides play the game and show brilliance while doing it. It took probably the best counter attack i have ever seen for belgium to win this one. Probs to both teams.
To this day that last goal still gives me chills everytime i think of it
Nacer Chadli going full blown Usain Bolt right there :p
Belgium🇧🇪 is the best.
My match of the tournament cannidate <br>4.5 out of 5 star match
Hairy coochie 😆😆😆
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=50">0:50</a> Man if a couple bounces went Japan’s way there
Japan could’ve played defense after they made 2 goals, but they didn’t, they decided to play football and for that I will always have great respect for Japans team, love from Belgium 🇯🇵🇧🇪
Japan deserved to beat Belgium, Belgium have always been arrogant.
I guess you could say Belgium were... HEADstrong in that comeback.

It&#39;s a routine to watch this once in awhile
The red team look like supa strikas 😍😍
Nc
To me japan is the winner
Love jaban
In fact, Japan and Belgium have played 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses so far.
Most dramatical game
apparently this was the first time in world cup history that a team managed to win within 90 minutes after being 2 goals down in the second half!
Amazing run from lukaku in the last goal, pulled the defender in to allow meunier open
Hope Portugal have taken note of this....
ordéname chinitos 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Japan lost the game, but they won our hearts.
i love japani <br>i love japan
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=53">0:53</a> el principal error del primer gol es que el que cubría la pelota fue con miedo ahí lo ven
Japan could have easily won this game after going 2-0 up. Belgium didn&#39;t really win it, Japan lost it. They just keep on pushing forward, instead of managing the game.
amazing game but this was heartbreaking
This game was a perfect demonstration of how far Japanese football has come and how far it has to go to be a top footballing nation. Japan technically are on par with the best nations but are still lacking physically (this gap is closing now though). They still need to get over mental barriers and not to have inferiority complexes against big teams like Belgium. The current team now is more talented than the 2018 squad and the Olympic team look very talented, so the future is bright for Japan! They might win gold medal at home😉
Almost forgot to watch this masterpiece today
Over confidence beat Japan
What a finish by Naser Chadli
Top 10 anime betrayals.
最後の一点は正に赤い悪魔だな<br>何十キロも走った後にあの猛ダッシュ…しかもその数5人。Despire red devils!!

Still feel bad for Japan
Can anyone help me telling the name of this commentator!<br>Very curious to know
In 2018: crying<br>In 2021: Still crying 😭<br>Huge respect for such a perfect goal... from Japan
Please tell me who is the commentator of the match?
this game was so awesome, I still remember it!
In that match i got lot of shock for Japan because i am only Japanese supporter from childhood..
🖕🖕🖕🖕🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
So beautiful match. What we wanna see
What a game
I still remember the reaction from me and my family that moment whas insane!(iam from belgium)
未だに最後の本田のフリーキックが決まる世界線を探して彷徨ってる
Japan is so oppp
&quot;I AM TOTALLY SURE THAT THE PERSON WHO STOPPED TO READ THIS MESSAGE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN EVERYTHING HE DOES&quot;
&quot;I AM TOTALLY SURE THAT THE PERSON WHO STOPPED TO READ THIS MESSAGE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN EVERYTHING HE DOES&quot;
Japan must remember this game forever so as not to be repeated. And I hope that they break the past.
I remember I was like 14, I WAS CRYING CRYING it was to beautiful 😭😭 🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪
日本はGK弱点。川島いつまで使うんだか。森保監督も嫌い。アジアカップ負けた時や、韓国に負けた時に監督辞めて欲しかったのにまだ辞めないなんて
This comeback never gets old,Goosebumps everytime I watch this😃
That&#39;s my Country ❤🇧🇪
It&#39;s been 3 years ago and I still have to watch this goal every now and then
im still can&#39;t move on from this game , its beautiful
NO 💔 😭😭😭
Respect for Japan from belgium !!❤️
The only Asian can beat Europe team is Japan &amp; Korean
Chadli et fellani made in Morocco
Aku dtg sini balik lps tgk belgium buat teamwork goal lwn Denmark kt euro 😍😍😍 KDB 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This moment will stay with me forever, what a game!
2018 ൽ ഏറെ ആവേശോജ്വലമായ ഒരു മാച്ച്.. 2 ഗോളിന് 80 മിനിറ്റ് വരെ പിന്നിൽ നിന്ന ശേഷം മൂന്ന് ഗോളടിച്ച് ബെൽജിയം ജപ്പാനോട് ജയിച്ച മത്സരം.. ബെൽജിയം ടീം അംഗങ്ങളുടെ പ്രതിഭ വിളിച്ചോതുന്ന മത്സരം❤️❤️👌👍

Rode duivels!!!😁<br>I do feel sorry for japan tho man they were 100% certain of their victory
best match
One of the  best  match  from all  world cups
Im Telling you in the whole campaign this game was out of the world
Japan had trouble stopping the defeat🤣 sounds so familiar like the wars🤣
Japon merecia ganar, tremendo equipo y portero que tenian, pero para mi fue uno de los mejores partidos que vi de ese mundial
日本人で日本応援してたけど、必ず勝たなくちゃいけない相手に0:2で負けてて、逆転できずらそうな時に出来て、相当嬉しいだろな、
daym tibo pass it to debruyne in last min
Football no worries <br>Japan is still no 1 in entertaining the world (by animes) imo
They lost that match because they were shorter , Belgium using a lot of headers that game
Belgica entrou nessa copa só pra encher o saco do Brasil e japão, nem a copa ganhou
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=96">1:36</a> thats so clean
World cup classic
가와시마가 못막긴한다 정성룡 못지않은 덩크맨. 일본 골키퍼는 진작 세대교체했어야 했다
What an amazing counter attack from Belgium! Waw
France revenge our Japanese friends . Frites belges au déjeuner 😝🤤
Cuma kalah bola atas doang, tapi overall terhibur banget
this game is the best showcase of what the sport offers, hands down.  I remember barely watching it because I hadn&#39;t been happy with JPN in the tournament so far.<br><br>Whoa to behold, and nearly woe to BEL, both teams gave all fans a match to both enjoy and be proud of
Japan amazing....
This game... the best in the WC 2018 my dad couldn’t handle the second goal of Japan and went cycling 😂<br>Japan thanks for the fair and strong game 🇯🇵🙏🏼
Japan made whole Asia proud
If Japan had a better GK, they would have made it into the semi finals
wow
RL9 playing without the ball

Ahahhaahahahhahahahahahahahhaahhahahahhahahahhahaah
そこのパスをスルーするのかぁ
Nippon gokil coeg
Eden Hazard la légende 💯
World Cup 2018 was one of the most entertaining. People are just mad because their favorite teams were out. Thank you, Croatia and Belgium.
Coming back to this legendary match, probably the best of the whole World Cup that year. Japan played such a beautiful footbal, with a great mindset, and put our Belgian players in huge danger, which led them to become absolute beasts for the comeback. The whole game was breathtaking, huge respect to Japan for being the best opponent against Belgium since a long time !
Who&#39;s watching this in 2021?
la france n&#39;as pas fait la même erreur que le japon
en vrai la belgium mérite pas
As a belgian myself i can tell you when that third goal went in belgium went crazy
Asian level
What a shock 😭😭😭 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=33">0:33</a> 😁😁
I didn&#39;t watch this game thinking Belgium were gonna win easily 😭😭😭
On that day we all asians are with japan❤️.. Bad luck
E Pensar q o Brasil pegaria o Japão...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJeJuc27ggE&amp;t=114">1:54</a>

Jepang memang cahaya asia
Who&#39;s watching before euro 2020?
Japan is Best asian Team.
Japan has see Brasil waiting..in quater final so they  don,t want to win Belgum !
One of the most heartbraking moments in the 2018 WC, Japan was so close :(
Mantap
One of the best matches in Football history. An Underdog about to win against a fancied super team who are all in their primes and the greatest Belgian team up to date. What. A. Counter. That was the mother of all counters right there.
The match that inspired Blue Lock 🔒
