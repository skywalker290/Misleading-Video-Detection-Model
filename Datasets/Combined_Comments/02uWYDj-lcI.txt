maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan wtf........shit like this makes you wonder....like seriously wtf man
CGI? what freaks me out is, how the cloud seem&#39;s to evaporate like the water was heated up? Freaky
Fue estudiado el video x in show American y descubrieron in el primer vista so era falso en Una parte antes Del dus esta y en la otra ya no y buelve a aparcer un truco muy malo totalmente &quot; FALSO&quot;
It must be a &quot;chinese lantern&quot;... but in Brazil they launch really big ones, like 50m high. When it burnt it released the torch, which divided by two when it was falling.
I bet you say that to anyone who disagrees with you.
You sound like an idiot hahaha
That&#39;s so fake!!
Manta Ray
Procure no original. Lá tem.
it could be a top secret military weapon

Really?  Okay please make one and post it.  Thank you. ;)
FAKE six time I have seen this. It fake. 
o video e original e alem de tudo tem outro ufo rodeando neste video!
The ONLY reason I&#39;m here is because my dad called me last night and explained seeing something JUST like this. I told him to dig around and find something similar and here it is. He wouldn&#39;t lie to me and this is a video of EXACTLY what he described. You don&#39;t know me but nothing is worse than hoaxing or lying about something as important as life outside of our own. I would NEVER do it.
That was not a hoax, I see them everyday and he saw the ship, that was great but he was too fascinated by that to notice the entire scene in the sky that they had created. Don&#39;t believe me look at again at 42 mark. There was an entire scene in the sky being created, and there are orbs all over that sky hiding behind clouds to keep from being seen. I see them every day, so I would know. 

someone nuke that shit hole of Brazil
say hello to ur new friend ......
If this video is real then.........oh dear!
Brazilians were never good at faking anything.. Other then orgasams.. 
it is fake and the authors announced it....search it up!
@pocketrocket426 i see what you mean. but that doesnt prove its fake. Looks like its missing when its flashing a couple times aswell.

After seeing how good people are with adobe after effects though im not so sure on this one either
I know many people believe this is fake...can someone tell me how they created such a bright, flashing light and then drop smaller lights? thanks  
That&#39;s a friggin weather balloon blowing up.  You can hear the explosion during the last few seconds of video.  That&#39;s helium and aluminum burning as it falls.  Any chemistry major can attest to that.
O mais interessante neste vídeo é que não tem depoimentos em português, estranho.. 
Fake, 1 frame before the truck enters the picture the ufo is missing.
wow this is some of the most amazing footage ive ever seen.... they would have to be amazing to do this CGI.... the cloud lights up from inside indicating that the craft is actually causing that light.... wow guys good catch!!!!
I have seen , on two occasions orange globes hover quite a distance away,and eject white hot material that flared up in the night sky unbelevably bright! Some of the material went clear to the ground, like in this vidio, they are getting rid of something! I also have heard that these craft run on a liquid metal form of fuel, and get rid of some at certain intervals. once saw a tv show where a man actually picked some of this up and put it  in his car trunk, it looked like melted aluminum!
I dont think thee are any inhabbitable planets.. In fact I think the nine or eight planets here are the only ones in the galaxy and universe... Just stars and BIG asteroids
the exact flash that happpened in jerusalumaiomoa
Anyone who supports this please lets unit and asks the authorities what&#39;s going on ALL AROUND....... We seriously need some answers now...... we elected them and that&#39;s our RIGHT!! I mean its become so frequent from last couple of months that it&#39;s become boring now........ What do they take us for a dyslectic retards????!!

lets unit and keep in touch................ 
@Oweboy1960 

If this is real.
These are your Demons at work.
O.O!
wtf
I don&#39;t care if someone has been doing CGI for years, or abt some &quot;video-editing expert&quot; coming on here like they know everything saying it&#39;s a fake..your opinion is invalid. Listen to your own heart folks and trust your intuition. Much less likely to deceive you than some alleged expert bring nothing to the table. &quot;look at the frame here; it does this and that; etc etc&quot; no stfu and go &quot;debunk&quot; an episode of spongebob squarepants..tell us he&#39;s not yellow but citrine. 
If this is a fake then this guy should be making some hollywood  movies by the looks of it
Fake my ass.. that shit looks totally real.

I hate how debunkers automatically dub a video &quot;fake&quot;. have you analized it? Looked at in in slow motion frame by frame? Using diferent light filters also? 

That footage is real and a great one imo. Thanks for posting!
@zezba9000 yes i saw it,,on u tube too u can stop it right there ,,wtf 
personally i think its one of the best REAL or best FAKES put out in the past 2 years...
@salo73 I mean that when the lights come on, the UFO either moves fast enough to appear to disappear or it leaves this dimension, either way, the UFO show is over.
@a55kika18 I think its a warp like star trek
Looks like the star ship enterprise when it goes into warp
could someone tell how  this guy knows the exact spot  where the ufo would be?
the rumbling at the end sounds like the rumbling you hear in the recent &quot;strange noise in florida&quot; video.  there are also flashes of light, but the lady only filmed the flash at the end.  it&#39;s as if they are opening up some kind of portal to another dimension.    just an observation.  
@DISCL0SUR3 what is with the lights?Would you mind explaining that?I&#39;ve seen a few videos of UFO&#39;s beaming light and stuff but I don&#39;t get it.
@marcos497 

what are they talking? 
i know all these alien-shit is nwo-agenda....ufo´s (aircrafts) are technnology from the earth (nazis were first)
Well ,these kids are good actors, you guys dont understand the language, Their scripted speech was going well, until one of them mentions that the ufo is &quot; going down &quot; he actually says that before the craft goes down, other than that their theatrical skills(Dramatic comunication) were perfect sync with the wind blowing and the sound of cars passing by...
Well teleport tecnology its seems to be pretty advanced for us and the lighy omg.. its just like an Galatic Federation Mother Ship
they are falling behind the trees. go catch them........
no video...
this is fake!! i m brazilian!!fuck lie!! midia want you abilive this shiit!!!
Like I said, when you see the lights, the show is over.
este video é nosso po...
Very poor CGI!!! Especially the &#39;falling debris&#39;. Fakers faking.
@Aluminiumimmunitaet What are you talking about...? I think it is fake...
its funny. the more REAL videos are claimed as FAKE. n the fake ones are more believable.  It obvious we just do not want to accept this sort of thing is taking place. making all the movies and story of past be true. we are scared of what we don&#39;t know. 
Just go back to bed and pretend it isn&#39;t real. Its time to WAKE UP! 
Thats the real truth...
@DISCL0SUR3 This dude know whats he talkin about!!
paresia un zeppelin 
i look at a lot of these kind of videos and unfortunatly it looks like a fake. i believe in other forms of intelligent life. but when someone makes a video that even remotely looks like cgi and the people who shot this are unkown usually for a reason but its a nice try.
Nice After Effects job, obviously fake.
Had a close look at the video and I can not see any hints of CGI. The frame &amp; pix looks very clear.
FAKE
@zezba9000 
Thank you for your kind words ;)
@Yogsoggeth &quot;why hasnt he added links to the original in the discription&quot;
-- Maybe he doesn&#39;t know,.. as you say with all the reposting it makes it hard to find the original. But this is not one persons fault, its just the YouTube environment right now. I know video&#39;s that I have found I would love to repost to make it viral. That is whats going on here.

I wouldn&#39;t judge people intentions so quickly as there can be many reasons for why something is the way it is.
@zezba9000 if he didnt make it then why hasnt he added links to the original in the discription. thats the polite thing to do when posting someones video you don&#39;t own.
also why would u repost something thats an obvoius fake like this on a channel called DISCLOSURE3 if it wasnt intended as misinformation. its not that hard to find real UFO Footage. but people like this are making it harder and harder by re posting fakes and posing as pro Information/disclosure..
@Yogsoggeth &quot;DISCLOSURE3&quot; is not &quot;DISINFORMATION3&quot;... He posted up this video for other people to see. He did not make it, so don&#39;t blame him for anything. DISCLOSURE3 is put in front of all his video&#39;s, just check out the other video&#39;s on his channel, many of which are very good.
@zezba9000 Hate to say this but you&#39;re right. Pause at 1:01 right before the truck crosses through the picture and the thing vanishes for 2 frames. ALso I don&#39;t think real UFO vid&#39;s have production company credits at the start :( &quot;DISCLOSURE3&quot; AKA DISINFORMATION3??
blah blah blah fake blah fake, why dont you go and watch something else and bother them for awhile! you bunch of know it all experts, oh listen to me i know what i am talking about i am sooooo smart! geez, like i have said before they will become more clear and i think this is REAL so shut the f up and go take a hike
cada ves que lo miro , descubro un detalle nuevo ...
01:30 tiene un especie de cubierta , compuerta &quot; y listo para LANZAR 
01:36 la columna de nubes solo camufla la forma de la nave .
01:39 si aprecias bien , se ve claramente como al manifestarse tanta energía VERDE? en la nube dejo el hueco del radio MAGNÉTICO &quot; mierda &quot; que caña 
01:40 CLARO QUE DESAPARECE !!!!
&gt;Una cosa mas..
según cables desde Argentina , especulan de cierta relación entre pilotos de la fuerza Aeria y no se quien de la Constelación Galáctica , en fin ...su mensaje era claro sobre el pronostico , y la actualidad , pero Hablan de un trabajo en especial... 
mantener , la tierra sostenida por Hilos magnéticos .
suena raro pero podría ser .. la solución..  
SI NO ME ENTIENDES INFÓRMATE:::&quot;&quot;:&quot;::&quot;
Hey Guys, I`m in Brazil and not far from the cities they mention in the video which are Bauru and Lençois, in the interior of the State of Sao Paulo. By any means someone can point me to the original uploader channel ? I would like to get in touch with them and gather more details if possible. Thanks.
@zezba9000 its real!!!
the light does not reflect off anything, the other clouds should light up  with a bluish reflection when it gets that bright.also if something that large moved that fast in a cloud i think it would disrupt the cloud
THIS IS FUCKING REAL!!!!! NOTHING FAKE ABOUT THAT! that was an alien space craft great great video!
FAKE!!!
@DISCL0SUR3 If you look at this video frame by frame you will see that it only disappears &#39;One&#39; frame before the truck covers it up, this is pretty clear that its video editing. As much as I would like to think this is real, it&#39;s just probably not.

I hate when ppl make fake stuff, all it does is make ppl who can&#39;t think for themselves more close minded you know. I think we first must change within to see the change we seek externally. I also kinda wonder if &#39;they&#39; are waiting for that as well.
@wideafukinwake totally agree dude ,i been bangin on about the fake jerusalem vid since it started and i feel just like u do ,every time one of these appears it sets everything back to start again in the eyes of the wider sleepers.doubt is a big word and is easily cultivated and this just muddys all the real evidence all over again.
Wow this is a keeper thank you 
this is fake you stupis fucks
You want a bit of new in your washed disinformed brain ? Take that guys :
?v=6Zf7scVDQ1g You won&#39;t regret to watch it. The guy doesn&#39;t seems fake at all. At least less than your studies about the different dimensions :)
This is just that if you would know special effect you would understand that what makes the video incredible is that the truck is passing in front of the came so everybody says wow this is not a fake so if you had to do that trick you would have to delete the input of the ship before the truck and put it back after. That&#39;s what he did but a bit too early hehehe, sad that could have been well made. By the way stop with your stupid dimension we have more dimension in ourself that those stupid 5th.
It looks real but it should be investigated and analyzed by the likes of Jaime Maussan a professional ovni/ufo investigator.
FAKE.  I managed to pause on the last frame before the truck crosses and the thing disappears. Nice try though..
When it&#39;s too much for our perception , we absolutely don&#39;t have the choice to say it&#39;s fake. We don&#39;t know at all about inter-dimensions, and different physics that is apply in different density and/or dimensions.I&#39;d like to see this vid being entirely investigated by real proffesional studios : )
very tough call for me, dome of rock vid definetly real. the fact that the craft changes from solid to light doesnt bother me, thats to be expected with our limited understanding. just would have liked to see a zoom or something, oh well time will tell. nice up ;-)
ITS REAL!!! but all the drivers including the biker near the end just didnt have the cam with the editing software to see it... 
@zezba9000 
If this is in fact an authentic alien craft, there is vast amounts of evidence suggesting that these ships are inter-dimensional.  I have seen credible videos of these craft literally flickering in and out of 3rd density, this would certainly explain why the craft disappears upon close analysis.
This is fake.
Read the comments from this video:: watch?v=zvUel_ZDRdY
The space craft disappears before the truck blocks the camera. You can download the video, then open it up with QuickTime player. Use the arrow keys to go frame by frame &amp; you will see what i&#39;m talking about.
fake..
wow
:o WTF
