from 2024
The tiny bit of red is to catch your attention in the first place. I don&#39;t know how scientific this is, but it is believed that red is the most eye catching color for the human eye, and often people&#39;s attention will be drawn to the color red first before they&#39;re even aware of what they&#39;re looking at. Admittedly a lot of the thumbnails I notice first have some kind of red in them. I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s used just to increase the chance of people noticing and I guess taking an interest in your video.
When a youtuber says &quot;This video is getting too long already...&quot; as if there&#39;s a limit, or people don&#39;t watch 5h video essays.
Well you can’t get a sufficient amount of subs…
I feel like this video was all about how anything pewds does is okay and every thing else is annoying
I was not entertained. Stopped watching at 4.
Great
he reads comments but does he like them? 👀
PewDiePie Nice 🎧
This video has aged like wine.
:)
Hundred percent agree. It&#39;s so ridiculous how people can literally write a formular of what to say and do to make people do certain thing. People are npcs and they don&#39;t even realize it.
UX designers for youtube watching this:  👁👄👁
&quot;you&#39;re not slick&quot; hahaha get fucked commenters
Don&#39;t let MrBeast see this video!
I are come downstairs and fall :(
Wait he has legs?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=680">11:20</a> I completely agree with you on this one, it&#39;s one of the reasons I like your videos actually😂
All these &quot;I like how&quot;, &quot;I love how&quot; is what made pewds just sort by new. Also stop making some kind of dialogue it&#39;s not funny and quirky. <br>Pewds: ur mome gay<br>Me: no<br>Hahahahahahahaha so funny 🤣🤣🤣 like stfu it&#39;s not and people that are liking it has a sense of humor dryer than the sand on Mars.
Good to know pewds has legs
Poopdie came out on my birthday
I wish I got in on this Christmas merch, but YouTube has NOT improved since this. XD
it&#39;s so annoying when youtubers have the nicest house and cars and give $100 to someone and act like it&#39;s all they do.<br>also, when they have some prodject and update you every 2 days when there&#39;s no progress
My pet peeves are when YouTubers complain about other YouTubers copying them because they play the same game or react to the same video ect
Now I understand why I like watching Pewds so much. Lol we basically hate everyone and everything. And everything is just super cringe. Lol
My pet peeve is when in challenge videos like mr beast or Morgz they feel the need to throw in day 4 or hour 9 in the thumb nail it’s just day/hour then a random number it just kinda annoying
One more thing is those YouTubers who ask opinions or something like you correct them and they say STFU or i don&#39;t care, like dude you are literally cancelling a 9 year old that is potentially smarter than you, don&#39;t act cool.
Mr. Beast yelling about money: I&#39;m in danger
yaagga
Hearing you say &quot;I DON&#39;T CAARREEEE&quot; in that heavy Swedish accent is very nostalgic.
YouTubers like you Felix are very lucky. You were already popular before the adpocalypse and the changes to the algorithm, you can essentially make whatever you want and people will watch it because you are PewDiePie. <br><br>If I did a 3 Scary Games Series on my channel probably about 50 to 100 people would see it. Where as you can make a video of you taking a shit and it will practically go viral. <br><br>I can understand why people want to play to the algorithm and make sure people are actually seeing your stuff, spending 6+ hours on a good quality video just for 200 people to see it really sucks.
i think if pewd had started in this era too he would be doing the same thing .... unfortunately thats how it is now
you lied to me. Where are the pewdiepie thongs.
love how Sive put &#39;sexy voice&#39; when it was his part

I rly wanna know why the heart dosn get tired
true thats how his tumnail looks now
bruh pyrocincal cameo
so you was watching fifty shades of grey
A year later... he still can&#39;t be bothered about thumbnails :&#39;) &lt;3

i like the sarcastic of pewds that he used the thumbnail as well lol
ain&#39;t it ironic that he himself does it now.
One of the most immersive experiences you will find on smartphone
Pewds: &quot;If the video starts off as super obnoxious, just click away.&quot;<br><br>Also Pewds in 2021:<br><br><b>KEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!!</b>
Now every pewd video has same tumbnail with red color
Great video Pewds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=34">0:34</a> lmao pewds do this too now
Lol
&quot;if you see any video that starts off super intensive, it should be a sign to click off&quot;<br>jacksepticeye:<br>TOP OF THE MO-
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=930">15:30</a> Felix you can sort by newest.
The moment I clicked I recognized his facecam to be the time he reused in his thumbnails as a joke
Imagine Youtube trying to get the most successful person on the platform to change their approach.  Piss off, YT.
lol now look at yourself
When they say sorry for the bad set up I moved but their set up is worth 200000
And now the thumbnail faces continue
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=68">1:08</a> i can&#39;t xd
Pewds!! 😦 <br>You sooo thiccc!!😤
Using the same face picture in every thumbnail sounds familiar...<br><br>Mark, Bob, and Wade: ...
basicly this is a tutorial on how to scam people to watch your bullshit on YT. thank you, i will try that :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=201">3:21</a>
It’s funny to come back to this video when he almost used the same thumbnail for 3 weeks
Literally PewDiePie&#39;s last four videos have that tiny bit of red he complained so much about. He became the monster he tried to destroy :(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=1174">19:34</a>
This was posted on my birthday
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=278">4:38</a> perkele
How nearly everyone on YouTube starts their video with “Hi Guys”
pewds: I hate it when YouTubers put the same face for every video<br>pewds now: <b>same face every thumbnail</b><br><br>LOL
I literally had joe rogan spicy ones recommended.<br><br>What tf do I care?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=225">3:45</a> Well... That didn&#39;t age particularly well...
Okay, I guess...
I&#39;ve been a fan since the beginning pewds, but why dont you help markiplier grow more? If you wanted to you could go on strike til your subs sub to mark. Or you could visit their house and use force to make them sub.
PYRO NO
This video reminds me of Danny Gonzalez instead of pewds…
Me looking back at his recent uploads, still seeing same face all over the place.
i just noticed these recent videos that pewds be having thumbnails with the same facial reaction
Sive litterally edited his own raid shadow legends ad into the video lol
This is a podcast
Red is a colour commonly used because it gets people attracted to it more for whatever reason. That&#39;s why so many apps and fast food restaurants have red in their logos
those WHY videos are pretty good like Why japan doesnt hate u.s.a? i was wonder and damn japan was the king of war crimes
Cancel knowledge
This explains the recent thumbnails
Lol markiplier is the YouTuber that starts important sentences and never finishes it.
3.59 HE ACTUALLY DOES THIS NOW 😂
WHY IS WILLNE HERE LMAOOOO DID HIM DIRTY
<b>comment</b>
Well really why don’t planes go over the pacific… I need to know now
Tal fishman is probably the most annoying youtuber ever
I agree on everything
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=353">5:53</a> <b>Mr beast who has worshiped pewds for over 5 years</b><br>Mr beast: am I a joke to you?
Damn if my girl was wearing a pewdiepie thong sheeesh i would marry right away
My pet peeve is....<br>&quot;i WaS tHe fIRst oNe tO CoMmEnT oN ThIS vIdEO&quot;
Obnoxious screaming yelling and very obvious fake emotions are the worst
I hate it when: <br>A youtuber sponsorships raid shadow legends while my brother is choking
Pewds complain about these youtubers then but he is doing same thing now in 2021😅😅
Well.. most of the criticism you have made, matches Mr Beast&#39;s channel. This video didnt age well...
IDC what you say Internet Historian makes the best ads i&#39;ve ever seen anywhere
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=171">2:51</a> Did Felix just dis jack
didn&#39;t you literally have a podcast with Ken?? what happened to that
😏👌
A
My pet peeves are those stupid 5 minute craft videos, stop recommending me that content farm garbage please
i love how he mentions the faces people make in thumbnails and his most recent videos have the exact same one in each of them😂
My biggest Youtuber pet peeve is when YouTubers don&#39;t put the name of the background music they use in their videos.
Does PewDiePie actually read comments<br><b>He’s not going to read this</b>
Damn. Watching this one a year later and it&#39;s still accurate...
The people who&#39;s comments got liked:<br>Sh*t he acctualy saw my comment.<br><br>The people who&#39;s comments got liked then unliked:<br>...
damn, pewdiepie really turned into a clone of myself in this video. Seems so good that you changed so much, you used to be the ultimate teenage girl cringe guy.
I know this is a year later but the ad secret. thank you so so so much, king
Liked and subbed for dual shadow legend on raid..
U luk like the vampire from true blood
&quot;what is this budget vsauce?&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=318">5:18</a>   had me rolling XD
Also the fake giveaways, saying that they going to giveaway cards or money and all of that, saying &quot;all you have to do is Sub Like Com Bell&quot; all that. And majority of YouTubers that do this are clearly fake
I also watch videos on 2x speed to save time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=564">9:24</a> omg, you have legs
Bet you wont read this comment 😎
The fact that pewds did use that face in the thumbnail makes me happy
I think EVERY YouTuber has done these things to some point. If not, their idiots. I guarantee Pewd&#39;s has done some of these. In 5 years, the stuff he does now will be &quot;looked down upon&quot; by YouTubers with 100 million subscribers. Of course lmfao. Why would they care at that point. It&#39;s not necessary anymore. It&#39;s just hypocritical. And yes, I find a lot of these to be annoying. But, it&#39;s everywhere. It&#39;s okay to disagree sometimes. I don&#39;t hate a person because they call out stuff they did in the past. Take Pokemane for example. I mean, nuff said. You have multi-millions per year, everyone else is wrong for even trying now.
Pewds: I watch videos at 2x speed<br>Me: Same. 2x speed all gang
I hate the comments on nostalgic videos saying things like &quot;Is anyone else here for nostalgia?&quot; or &quot;Anyone else here in(current year)&quot; and the worst part is the fact it gets thousands of likes and replies. This may sound like jealousy of all the likes and attention..... It 100% is. I wish I could put no effort into a comment and get praise from a bunch of sheep but no. I try to come up with a genuine comment that&#39;ll add to the conversation
<b>I really HATE IT when YouTubers tell us to “ring the bell” especially in EVERY VIDEO. We all know about the goddamn bell. We just don’t want to be notified of your IDIOTIC videos, Linda!</b>
&quot;dont ask a question on your title! i dont care&quot; 🤣 its funny watching it after watch his new video
And you got 8mil views
.
I see the legs
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=332">5:32</a>)<br>Well in those “Why Vids” defence, you did specifically search it up and even if it did come in your recommend, it’s not the videos fault for making a title that about THE TOPIC OF THE VIDEO <br>Also if it’s roping you into the video and you don’t need to know this information anyway at the end but you still want to click on the video and isn’t that the point? To attract people to click on your own videos because it’s not like tooling with the algorithm, it’s just an interesting topic
HAHAHAH &#39;Today I Found Out&#39; as budget Vsauce. Thats absolutely hilarious, cuz Ive ALWAYS thought that as well hahah
Probably because you&#39;re on it
poor mrbeast
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=536">08:56</a> Internet Historian’s take on the promo is actually an original one, and very entertaining at that. I really watched it from beginning to the end. That promo section has more entertainment value than most of the videos that you can find on the tube
@itsJerian<br><br>CAMEO
Noticing pewdiepie also used the red shade on his thumbnail
He should talk about Nikocado Avocado. I swear it’ll be funny 😂
&quot;If you click on a video and it starts off too intense, just click off immediately.&quot; <br><br><del>immediately begins roasting 2012 pewdiepie</del>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=237">3:57</a> the start of the annoying thumnail lol
Why is sssniperwolf is the first subject on this video
hes thumbnail has red next to his face lol
asallahuakbar
pewds: ur not gonna get anything out of loud intros<br>jack:
when i was younger i thought azzy and sssniperwolf was the same,just like someone in the comments said
pewds
Do I find Pewdiepie more articulate before than now?
This was posed on my birthday 😀
my pet peeve is pure reaction channels. ik pewds reacts but he makes it funny so hes ok but there are certain youtubers who just play other peoples tiktoks and videos and occasionally say wow and idk if its just me but i find it very annoying
respect for pewds for putting up a south park pic in the video
You didn&#39;t say.... When every creator starts their video with &quot;Hey guys&quot; ..... That gets so annoying
Think about how all those people who had their comments liked and unliked just for this video! So sad... U know they saw that notification and were so stoked
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=79">1:19</a> imagined that photo on the red rectangle on every video that has a title like<br><br>&quot;TOP 10 BIGGEST PIZZAS!!1&quot;
Lmfao, the poopdie ad Felix worked into his video popped up, and was immediately cut off by a webull ad, priceless.
I really hate mob mentality, like a person says something, but doesn&#39;t call for violence, and some stupid mother fucker goes and attacks that person, I don&#39;t care if they do call for violence, if you are stupid enough to just obey someone blindly, whether you like them or not, you are pathetic.
One of my pet peeves are when randomly in the middle of the video the YouTuber plugs their own merch 😑
Not gonna lie, I enjoy watching Internet Historian&#39;s ads and those are some of the ads I never skipped. They are executed in an interesting way so it&#39;s not boring to watch.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=193">3:13</a> did... Did he forgot he used to scream from cupboards and or with/without some weird items
&quot;this does not affect me whatsoever but i am still bothered by it&quot;<br>ahh america
Hey don’t rip on JonTron he’s goated on the sticks my guy (I had to stop myself from self inflicted punch wounds after saying that btw)
Watch pewds say &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot; for 21 mins straight
Me watching this video years later but still decide pewds will see my comment on sort through new.
Pewds saying more than 100times:<br>  <br>   &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot;
even though I know that it usually works pretty well to yell every five seconds LIKE SUBSCRIBE AND TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS I still don&#39;t on any social media platform because it annoys me so much when that happens to me so I just don&#39;t do it
oof to pyro
Right now Jack has this stuff for thumbnails

i love reading the comment section
god bless you and your family everyone amen🙏 and Congratulations to everyone who is early and found this comment”🏆
My biggest problem with YouTubers nowadays is when their editors completely take over their content. It irks me so much whenever YouTubers I&#39;ve been watching for years get a new editor that can&#39;t go 5 seconds without adding in a pointless, intrusive edit.<br><br>Now there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with YouTubers hiring editors. And that style of editing CAN work when it&#39;s YouTubers like Foekoe of Apandah. But it doesn&#39;t work for everyone.<br><br>I used to LOVE Jacksepticeye&#39;s old content. But recently I watched his video on the Henry Stickmin collection. I quit watching about halfway through. His editor is TERRIBLE. The difference between his old content and what he makes now is like night and day. The edits are so intrusive and annoying and they don&#39;t fit his style of videos in the least. Markiplier&#39;s editor, Lixian, is kind of like this, but every now and then he doesn&#39;t have an edit over something (therefore making the funny moment funnier) or, maybe once in a blue moon, his edits can be kinda amusing. Plus it seems like Mark tries more in his recordings more than Jack appears to.<br><br>Now to clarify, no, I do not hate Jacksepticeye or Markiplier. I still do watch Mark and even though I don&#39;t watch him anymore, I still do respect Jack (and sometimes go back to watch his videos from a few years ago.)<br><br>It feels like those YouTubers don&#39;t have to try as much as they used to and just think that &#39;eh the editor will just add something funny in. Might as well half-ass it today&#39;. It really sucks, especially when the YouTuber never had irritating edits like that before.

I agree
Ooof.. thinking of Mr. Beast

I don’t care about most of the stuff in this video but it is annoying that because Felix talked in a baby voice and now so does everyone at school

Whos watching this in 2022
you say you read comments, say every comment
felix i thinkthey have the red because they put there face in it and I&#39;m pretty sure that like shows there reacting
im here to collect <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=201">3:21</a> kind of materials
Red is a very alerting color, therefor Sniper is probably using it. It helps with catching attention even a little bit.
Internet historian is differant with sponsers with nord vpn he makes a nord vpn person thats a predator
&quot;The people they hire for videogames can&#39;t write...&quot;<br>Soul Reaver / Legacy of Kain series.<br>That is all.
Is it just me or did he just make fun of Mr. Beast&#39;s methods in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=342">5:42</a> xD
&quot;Why the heart doesn&#39;t get tired&quot; is an interesting and useful video for those fascinated with biology though. I would, personally, thoroughly enjoy such a video, and also use it as functional knowledge.
The person who got his comment hearted by pewds must be freaking out
The rich flag pathophysiologically handle because bolt particularly spell without a actually kitten. nosy, idiotic time
The imaginary word postsurgically gather because sweater pathomorphologically punch alongside a intelligent afternoon. knotty, quickest square

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=847">14:07</a><br>Especially when they ask for likes every ten seconds of the video.

Wait why is there azzyland on the cover
he brags about him reading comments in every video.<br><br>i hope he sees this
I feel Pewds is genuinely a really nice guy, who is really down to earth in a way that he doesn&#39;t feel alien to me.
pewdiepie i don&#39;t like it when they ask me questions i don&#39;t care about: also pewdiepie &#39;&#39;which youtubers could i beat in a fight&#39;&#39;
Press is basically describing Mr. Beast
This video is still relevant to this day
Sorry ladies the pewdiepie thong stays on during sex

if you repeat the start over and over and think of knowing and annoying it sounds like both
Uhhh whats goin on u guys i have 10000000000 millinao subscsricebe

Pewds: complaining about raid shadow legends<br>Also pewds: GO DOWNLOAD LORD MOBILE RIGHT NOW
He’s not a boomer, he’s a YouTube veteran
<b>FONGS?</b>
2021<br>Just caught this and you&#39;re saying all the things I think about on here. I get it, and do your own shit, right? But I don&#39;t know how it went from &quot;you&quot; tube to television lite. There&#39;s an audience for everything, but it seems like the trainwrecks will always win out.<br>Not everyone and everything is going to be huge, but the things that do definitely have patterns. <br>Besides standout entertaining individuals. But then even they unintentionally have clones at times...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=68">1:08</a> Holy shit- I thought they&#39;re the same person
I strongly agree

I’m way late to this video, but I definitely agree with a lot of this. I also appreciate how levelheaded you are with your thinking - it’s refreshing!

hi
One of the most annoying things youtubers do:<br><br><br><br>&quot;ok GUYS whats up GUYS welcom back to my channel GUYS, ok GUYS today i will be doing...&quot;
Mr.beast      &quot;sad noises&quot;
its jarian gang
&quot;If I rant about YouTube, it&#39;s because I really want YouTube to do well. It&#39;s ridiculous to care about these small things, all these things don&#39;t mean anything by themselves, but year after year after year after year, each progression....It&#39;s not entirely impossible that we find ourselves looking at a YouTube that has been shaped in a way that we don&#39;t want it at all.&quot; Very true, especially today.
Facts
You know if you think about it you could pretty much put “why” in front of every title and you would probably get double the views like for example this video title could be “why YouTube is stinky” it’s just a way to get easy clicks and it’s sucks it has to be this way but I guess that’s just YouTube for ya
This got recommended to me after what happened to coco
hi
The female fertile grade holoprosencephaly harass because february conversantly memorise afore a fearful fearless keyboarding. previous, sneaky jet
Pyro and internet historian makes the raid ads watchable because how creative they are. Kinda would expect that from JonTron to make a creative ads.
we finally found out<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>why youtube hates pewdiepie and deleted his diss track
More rant videos! This is surprisingly pleasing to watch.
dude i jsut like ur videos
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=458">7:38</a> his phone rang and let me just tell u it almost gave me a heart attack cause I fucking hate that ringtone , it&#39;s the same one my dad has and whenever it rings it&#39;s usually my school calling him , ugh pewds made me scared....cancel him🌚 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Its sarcasm u dipshits
Bruh they arnt the same person i just thought azzy changed her name
How was this a year ago
I hate Azzyland because she copies off Sssniperwolf
I like Vanoss’ crew thumbnails, getting digital artist to create them. I do digital at myself and I wouldn’t mind doing thumbnail and get paid for it.
One thing I ✊ about Pewdiepie is he wears the real headphones. <br><br>Quality sounds like that can’t be put into wired or wireless <b>ear buds</b> <br><br>I’ve seen the revoews that claim to have a great range from treble to bass and anyone who thinks their pods are <b>Bumpin</b> are retarded.<br><br>Do the Xmas thongs come with zipper pockets too?
my pet peeve is every single pewds video being seen as a gaming video on youtube. dude we talking about memes and maybe pidgeons? idk ITS NOT GAME
hello from 2021 :D
I know I am late to commenting on this vid but you can hit sort by newest first then it is just not creator liked comments
Blip blop
How the hell is this 20 min long?
pewz rant podcast???????
&quot;You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain&quot;
&quot;that is why I don&#39;t do good things anymore&quot;<br>-and that&#39;s enough to make grown man cry
Pewds: complains about people making videos way too long<br><br>Also pewds: makes a 20 minute long video with no real point
Sssniperwolf&#39;s using the same 4 pics of her for every single video....<br><br>Like I like her and watch her, but her thumbnails kind of annoy me.
.
hey pewds
funny how i got this video recommended after a week of coco&#39;s disstrack being removed from youtube
“If a video starts off intensive, it’s probably not worth watching”<br><br>Jacksepticeye and MrBeast: 👀
mrbeast sub to mrbeast
Lmao rip to those 3 people who got a notification that pewds hearted their comment but then never got to see it
What does pet peeves mean?
pewds needs a podcast where he complains obout podcasts and YouTube and Instagram and everything
Well pewdiepie if you read this then vad tycker du är godast Ikeas köttbullar eller hemmagjorda?
Every reaction YouTuber ever: 😱
When I first started watching azzyland and sssniperwolf I thought they were the same person 😂🤣
My pet peeve is having no friends to count the 0 times I had fun
YT still be stinkin&#39; taking down Coco
Make a 2.0 after the recent activity
The people thing the same thing: HA! See I have a reason to hate my 9 year old cousin (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=28">0:28</a>)
Zoomer approved
Youtube <i>IS</i> stinky
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=460">7:40</a> : Sad Lines noises😥
Who is watching this in 2022
When Youtubers delete certain comments. Or when YouTube does it.
Raid shadow legends F A C T S
pewdiepie like my comment
My pet peeves is when you start a video then they begin to scream and shout and their energy is too much like damn chill bro
I came here after YT take downs Coco potang ina
Hi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=346">5:46</a> Mr.Beast is quaking
&quot;YouTube is stinky&quot;<br>YouTube : * Removes Coco *

wHo’S wAtChiNG iN 2o21?
Just now bought the merchandise
I&#39;m genuinely grateful you shared this with all of us bc these are literally all of my pet peeves as well. I was beginning to think I was just crazy because these things are everywhere now, and everyone seems fine with it.
It’s ironic because pewds is like the prodigal son of YouTube but he doesn’t follow any of their advice and rules <br><br>Edit: Love you pewds
Lol remember when every YouTuber was like “so they added this thing where they don’t notify you on my videos unless you click that little bell next to the subscribe button”
I know he didnt just call my boy simon whistler budget vsauce. Get out of here
This music 👀👀 its on Beau &amp; Caleb&#39;s Mighty Vibes!!!! Brah holy shit
I love how down to earth and honest he keeps it with his audience
You should also make a video about youtube comments<br>&quot;If you&#39;re watching this in 2020&quot;<br>&quot;omg thanks for the likes&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=1037">17:17</a><br><br><br><br>PewDiePie 1 ear later announcing his cocomelon song for 3 months
Sad mr beast noises
Pyrocynical
love u pewds ＼(￣▽￣)／
Having a very clear question in the title, and then spending half of the video introducing the question instead of answering it.
My pet peeves is people using like a 100 emojis in their title and thumbnails
ur so random pewwww haha
Imagine all of the 5 year olds that clicked on the thumbnail thinking its a azzyland video😂
Ravs be like *
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=615">10:15</a> my mind immediately went to tati
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=201">3:21</a> the video starts here
Hearing this is like everybody ik complaining about they’re jobs
me: tryin to find tech video in english (clicked a video) with an english tittle.<br><br>video: so guys sabhee logon ka din shubh ho kalahe
Super intense intro is bad click off - séan 🥲
back in my day you won for the pride
When he obviously wants to know but doesn&#39;t want to want to know.
What annoys me most from YouTubers, but it&#39;s hardly effective against me, is when you&#39;re watching this video, and while it&#39;s still animating (not when it&#39;s kept on one picture), it gets overlapped with the end screen that shows you thumbnails for other videos, and you know, it&#39;s just blocking everything behind it... and then there are these certain jokes about privates that, just to me, make me cringe. I really hate those jokes about male privates that have to do with toilets, it&#39;s just not my thing. It&#39;s actually why I don&#39;t sub here...
I hate...<br><br>When people BEG for likes on comments just to boost their ego<br><br>People who say...<br>WhO iS WaTChiNg In 2021<br><br><br>When YouTubers put like 50 ads in a video <br><br><br>When people copy content<br><br><br><br><br>I HATE when people are making videos with ABYSMAL acting, such as morgz
YES ME TOO I WATCH VIDS ON 2X SPEED &lt;3 (Also do youtubers get paid the same amount when i do?)
Ok I like you and all but NEVER and I say NEVER diss my man WillNE
Ooga Booga
I hate the channels that call out other channels because of how negative they are. And how they include personal bias into the video. Basically everyone who talked about the Miniladd situation like Prison Mate Luke.
then a few months later, all of roomieofficial&#39;s thumbnails are pretty much the same..
its not if you do it its how you do it
now this is epic
We need a part 2 of this
i hate the loud clicking noise when they play the subscribing animation
It would preeetty funny to do a &quot;Comment Section Rant&quot; as well
I really find it annoying that ypu cannot sort the youtube comments by<br>Top comments<br>Newest<br>Liked/hearted by the creator<br><br>Ik that it is given, but it doesn&#39;t work and when you do sort it by the Top comments, the most liked ones won&#39;t be on the top. :(<br><br>But, anyways Thank God, pinned comments are atleast on the top.
Papa Pewds&#39; ranting out about how youtube changes as generations changed. <br>(PS: I&#39;m with Pewds on this one xF)
Me when my teacher ask me questions : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=310">5:10</a>

Jerian MADE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Big will
Pyro was finally in a pewds video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=541">9:01</a>
pewdiepie : youtube is stinky <br><br><br>me : I DONT CARE !!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=9">0:09</a> when you Really wanna sneeze but you can’t.
Get my channel as big as Pewdipie&#39;s and I&#39;ll give you a cookie 👀
I agree with you Felix. I hate these YouTubers making money off of bullsh**
Things I dislike on YT:<br>Video titles without any capitals e.g. ‘i ate at a burger king...’<br>People saying “FiRsT rEpLy” with such pride.<br>Fake giveaways.<br>People who take 3+ minutes to begin the real video.
Is he using a voice changer? . . . Bruh-
When a couple years ago you got one ad at a time and now it give you two one minute videos
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=1133">18:53</a> : &quot;when youtubers overly complain about YouTube &quot;<br><br>Pewds: I disagree <b>titles video &quot;YouTube is Stinky&quot;</b>
bro I have arabic noika as a ring tone to my phone I literally thought someone is calling me   XD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=690">11:30</a> I understand and I think its totally tru3
My YouTube pet peeve is when a u tuber uses the same face for every thumbnail.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=672">11:12</a> thats all im gonna say
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=877">14:37</a> jacksepticeye has taken over<br>Literally sounds exactly like Jack
who be watching in 2021?
I don’t think Azzy and Lia are Vopy and paste. I think there just people who ended up looking the same and have the same personality
That thumbnail is hella sus
I know this video is old but SSSniperwolf is actually the one copying Azzyland
This comment is sponsored by raid shadow legends
When nobodies go to larger youtubers and says shit like &quot;what do you think of my channel&quot; or &quot;like if you agree&quot; just to generate more traffic directed to their own channel.
PEWDIEPIE IS DADDY
Me In 2021 hoping psds will like one of my comments
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=673">11:13</a> hmmmmmmmmm
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=371">6:11</a> sweating MrBeast noises
one year later and im just now figurin out what thongs are
My pet peeve is morgz bc he always Copies everyone and screams in his videos..
I hope all of pewds future vids start with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=201">3:21</a>intro lol
new one: stealing dream’s intro and showing your fucking statistics to gain subscribers
I love this guy, and all the points he was making are soo true
Hey if you are watching this in 2069 congrats u are alive
Mr. Beast is the master of Giving rewards in his videos but goddammit da shit good compared to the other channels
I agry
l
I saw WILLNE EEEEEEEEEE
My pet peeve is when people on aimless live streams say the dumbest questions ever so that the person can respond. Why do you need to know what they ate last week, and why do you want a room tour for no reason?
That uglysweater Pewdiepie edition set is literally the most beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever seen, and I&#39;m a year too late.
why does the face cam keep zooming in and out
Something that annoys me about youtubers is that they put something in their thumbnail and it isnt even in their video, and also the title of the video sounds way cooler than the video is, like it&#39;s such a disappointment
I like this vid and if you dont want to like it its good but Just reply if you like it :)
Me. Pick me...<br>I&#39;ll happily write descriptions for you, for the low price of nothing.
Who is watching in 2069?
And we dun care even if they used the same thumbnail
the pay 10k or something is just people copying Mr Beast
Finally we know who is STINKY
I stan internet historian and his sponsorships, still major entertain
PEWDIEPIE HAS LEGS AND HES ELLING THEM WOOOOW
&quot;Everyone has a podcast now&quot;<br>Me: <b>sweating profusely</b>
Pewds: I hate when theres pointless rewards in videos<br><br>Also Pewds: WHATS UUUUPPP MRBEAST!!!!!!!/ I love Mrbeast.
I wonder how much the lives of the people that had their comment liked and then had like removed were affected
Why is Azzy on his random vids
&quot;the writers that game devs hire are so <b>*****</b> bad&quot;<br><br><b>sad david cage noises</b>
My pet peeve:<br>When they make a long ass intro<br>When they “shade” other YouTubers<br>When they make a 30 min apology video
I was watching this in the background and when pewds was making the joke about being sponsored by raid, I thought it was a real sponsor 😂
Imagine those people randomly getting those hearts then having them removed
When I YouTube something basic like how to change my wallpaper (as an example im not this dumb) and the video is like 15 minutes long for some reason. This makes me irrationally angry and I just gave up on YouTube for tutorials at this point.
Those high tops where fire tho
Happy birthday video
the thing is I care about the questions since the vid is actually interesting. <br><br>idk its curiosity, it aint the cure for cancer
wow a whole year ago
my pet peeve is &quot;underrated comment&quot; and its always top 5 comments
poopdiepie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=350">5:50</a> this “why” sums up Youtube
Just realized every win 10k video is just a MrBeast concept reused
Phooods like my pubes
hey 2021 or 2022 or 2023 or 2050 or 3000 OR 9999999999999999
Imagine getting a like from pewds and getting all excited...<br>For him to unlike ur comment seconds later 😂😂😂
Man i am so happy you mentioned this annoying things on youtube! Youtubers are making it more annoying asking for subscription. And now everyone is doing the same thing! Shadow legends and AFK arena fuk you i am never gonna download your app!<br><br>Thank you Felix!
Who else made the video 2x after Felix said he does it just to see what it’s like.
now there is a graph that youtubers r using  that tells the percentage of ppl that r subscribed or not
The idea behind the red is that it draws attention to the veiwers eyes
Who wants to self promo here cuz YouTube is in fact stinky
lol just watched it even though its dec of 2020 didnt even know
Look, I love Felix but...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>He went for my man Chad Wild Clay <br>I can not forgive him I’m sorry Pewds
AHH NO JOKE EMMA CHAMBERLAIN DOES THE DRINK SPONSER MERCH THING AND ITS SO ANNOYING I LOVE HER VIDS BUT HOLY CRAP
Or you can just get an adblock for it, like me.
On the behalf of America, I apologize for these youtubers
I think the most annoying thing that YouTubers do is having a pure reaction channel, and all they do is react to really popular videos and it’s obvious that they just want to steal content
hi human wat are u hras
Hit J or left arrow to go back 10 or 5 seconds. Same for L and right arrow. Then K pauses the video.
yes lazily is a word
WHAT PEWDS HAS LEG s
YouTube: You should write a better description to get more views<br>Pewdiepie: I could care less<br>Pewds get 100M subscribers with crappy video descriptions.
And I then proceeded to watch the whole video on 2x speed
when he was talking about rade shadow legends and he said &quot; but wait if you download now... &quot; my headphones said LOW BATTERY bc they are Bluetooth and they died and i was said &quot; ya makes sense my computer will get low battery if a download it and im playing it all the time&quot;
&quot;this is such an epic rant&quot; exactly
pyro was in pewds video
Personally, I thought my thumbnails were never cringe,<br>At least since I learned to set them
i agree with most of them, my favorite is where they pull the same face in every thumbnail
hi piediepew
I knew Jon trim would be on there
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=561">9:21</a> is this what they called fan service
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=515">8:35</a> good thing internet historian make his ads more interesting
Those were Edgar’s legs, he doesn’t have legs
types of ppl i like: realistic normal humble funny caring supportive ppl <br>ppl like that: pewds💙
The cover explains it all
poods shouldve watched the aim sucks video. it would prevent n word incidents in the future
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=920">15:20</a> : their best day ever<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=922">15:22</a> : gone
8.52 sive
sorry about my comment a short while ago but Coronavirus AND mom is a little hard to stomach
he used azzylands face and sniperrwolfs face
pewds your completely sane... i think them Krispy quality vids are not that good that&#39;s kinda the reason i watch  yours... (oof)
Bring back the BroKen podcast.
pre recorded videos make you feel less in touch with the youtuber. if makes you feel alone instead of the youtuber being along your side.
My pet peeve is family YouTube channels like Morgz
.
whos watching in 1969?
I love u pewds
I like how felix says: well it clearly works, so everyone does it. also pewds: is the biggest youtuber in the world and doesnt do it.
You are wholesome
congrat sive for the edit at the end whit those legs
its optimus lmao
i love how willne is just in here
Everyone copies mr beast
I know I&#39;m about a year late but a pet peeve I have on YouTube is when I&#39;m watching an informational video and they try to either make a joke (and the joke isn&#39;t even funny most of the time) or just go off topic for a solid 20 seconds.
pewdiepie: dont yell or have super crisp setup <br>jacksepticeye: <b>looks away</b>
I don&#39;t think I have ever subscribed to someone cuz they said so
guru ji
You read comment?<br><br><br><br><br>Play minecraft more please.
Can we just take a minute to appreciate Jackson Wang at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=1096">18:16</a>

The complains about pre recorded videos and those too professional set ups remind me of a famous YouTuber in Brazil, Felipe Neto, I stopped following exactly for starting to lack that personal touch.
I was on my 67 daily log in reward then i missed a day and. I quit:)
i like how this face he made still exists in recent thumbnails lmao its still going
hhahhahhaha....AZZY AND SSSNIPERS MEMORY
U don&#39;t need ask for likes. I&#39;m on phone and when I swipe up to see next videos there is like button so I hit it.
Mr. Beast is crying
“ KNOW YOUR PLACE ! “ 😭
“Why does the heart not get tired like all the other muscles”<br><br>Because the heart isn’t a muscle
What about mr beast
Me:opens the video Ads: Takis hot nuts
Anyone else hereto hear him make fun of azzyland&#39;s accent from the thumbnail?<br><br>Man,it&#39;s not even her accent it&#39;s her voice... sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo annoying 😒🙄😲!!
I don&#39;t do any flaw that is mentioned here in my Youtube channel. Maybe Daniel MLG&#39;s commentary is present, but if never gets distracted. This is my mom&#39;s account... My phone got hacked or something. My account is getting recovered and it&#39;s called &#39;Jaison&#39;. Subscribe to PewDiePie my fellow humans.
Better title: &quot;pewdiepie making MrBeast&#39;s content down for 22 minutes straight&quot; 😂
Pewdiepie: I&#39;m working on something exciting, I hope I didn&#39;t say this.<br><br>literally right after: Here a new game coming out
my pet peeve are Dialog-memes in the comments section.
I hate it when YouTubers go on a long rant before they actually get to what the main video is about is so annoying and then once you try to skip through it they have an end in every few slots and they also tell you two times from the beginning and the end o like I subscribe like And subscribe comment to bet you didn&#39;t get to the freaking main point of your video.
Red is used because it is an eye catching colour
bUdGet vSauCe<br>hahahaha
I think a lot of ur opinions on this stuff makes a lot of sense like it really shows how u are so successful. Much respect. Keep being honest and true to ur fans along with yourself
There is a problem.<br>I&#39;m not a 9 year old anymore.
i hate the hacker dumbcrap and morgz is cringe
I bought an ad block chrome extension so I don&#39;t even need to deal with ads😎
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=239">3:59</a> he really did it<br><del>i mean it was for less than a month but</del>
Pewdiepie: stop asking questions, i don&#39;t care.<br>Pewdiepie: what is Jake Paul up to?
No
5% of felix’s thumbnails: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=2">00:02</a>
Who else hates when people copy comments<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>No......just me......okay
Boomer
Hiii
you see pewds, this kind of video that you made gave me insights of the things and how people and i interact with the outside world. i can say that whaat you do do entertain me and at the same time do what is in the above. but now it&#39;s saturated with reddit and even though there&#39;s still insight i could take it doesn&#39;t feel the same. however ypu do say that you had fun and it&#39;s all that matters right? i just want to say that i appreciate what you do and what it had done to me who came to be amused. cheers and brofist
This video is just felix telling you what youtube is
P
&quot;technical youtuber dont have insta followers&quot;<br>&quot;linus cries in canadian&quot;
My pet peeves are things that connect with Lele Pons
Morgs is my pet peeve
There is someone on YouTube whose voice is monotonous, even if (from a female perspective, I would say) good looking
It almost feels like azzyland is following the footsteps of sniperwolf when it comes to clickbait content
I feel like MrBeast popularized the 10,000 award thing and everybody copied, like morgz
I like how he really did the thumbnail with that face and red background
This showed up just as the &quot;shadow ban&quot; has been addressed
Hey you forgot ur biggest supporter @mrbeast
Mrbeast does and started a lot of this the most epic betrayal ever Pewdiepie attacks mrbeast
My pet peeve is the whole hide downvotes thing. It&#39;s so stupid. That&#39;s like going I DON&#39;T WANT TO HEAR IT IF YOU DISAGREE
何？！
Worst podcaster: Opie Radio, Stuttering John and Chrissy Mayer lol pewds needs to listen to who are these podcasts lol hed likely think
WhAT!?! They’re two different people 😦
I&#39;ve always wondered about how you read the &quot;democratic&quot; comments. I thought that maybe youtube is making it easier for the creator to see most valuable comments.<br>Probably, a special algorithm could be made if it will be strictly for creators of the video, if you think about it.
Youtube recommendations be like:<br>when you wanna search for something, you just fail to find it coz the <b>algorithm</b> doesn&#39;t allow it...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>meanwhile when you are about to search up something, it just pops up in your recommendation automatically</b>
Literally vents for 21mins straight. But I understand his points.
too many people posting the same joke in the comments over and over and over and over and over and over and over
&quot;we even got thongs&quot;<br><br>ok buddy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=980">16:20</a> <b>cough</b> iDubbz <b>cough</b>
types in ld you tuber <br>him: sees a bald guy <br>me: sees Anakin sky walker
Pewds says video game writers are bad so I will try to toss my hat in the ring of game writing for 11 crispy generational <br>games
annoying things youtubers do:<br><br>have insanely overdone 3D spinney intros
The 10,000$ in the box is just a couple of bills plastered in front
crybaby
wait i had no idea you had legs i have lived my life wuthout a leg reavel thank you for blessing me with your pretty legs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=280">4:40</a> hey that&#39;s tom scott
This video&#39;s thumnail has that red in it
Another one is when people edit their comment after it blows up, and say, &quot;OMG thank you so much for the likes&quot;. I have even seen a couple of people put like goals on their comments, saying, &quot;Can we reach 5k!?&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=668">11:08</a>
Did you know? I used to watch chad wild clays project Zorgo videos the reason I stopped watching them is because it’s similar to click bait to where it has been going on for 3 years now and it’s fake news that’s right FAKE NEWS!!! Don’t watch it If you don’t wanna get baited
I’m starting to think Felix is just naturally low quality in real life.
Video titles that end with “…” annoy me so much
Azzyland was actually the First youtuber I ever watched I did not like her boyfriend tho I think he cussed more and I hated that but idk I liked her just kinda outgrew her
Are you insulting jacksepticeye
I hate how every day on trending there is one person every day who vlogs about giving birth.
Personally I think when someone keeps on giving me something to buy is pretty obnoxious.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=1174">19:34</a> this face is so jarring.
don&#39;t double-tap 6 times,   just tap 7 times
I’ve got one, I hate when you tubers put 70 midroll add per video
mr beast be like NANI
I totally get it!
Hey PewDiePie can I ask you one more question why is your channel so good￼?
Cool found the origin of him using the same image for a thumbnail for a while.
Thought the pewds phone ad was the start of the video, very smart move YouTube I watched it all
I want a pewdiepie podcast pls
My pet peeve is ...you know in India they just say &quot;like if you this person and comment you like that person&quot; <br><br><br>😑
When I watch a video like “how to change your car tire” and my recommendation feed is a thousand videos on how to change a tire
I watch comment 😀😀😀 I but people don&#39;t watch me 😢😢😢😢😢😢
whos watching in 2032
when youtubers put teaser at the beginning of the video, thats just annoying
TBF Tom Scott videos are really entertaining, informative and overall really high quality. But he knows how to manipulate the clickbait &amp; thumbnails to a tea - though in a lot of vids he&#39;s humble enough to acknowledge the fact in an almost down-to-earth &quot;I do this but I&#39;m still better than this&quot;.
&quot;don&#39;t watch videos that start out intensive&quot;<br><br>Jacksepticeye?
lmao i just discovered this and it&#39;s so good. <b>clap clap</b>
Foot
Pewdiepie, is CoLoRbLiNd?<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=56">0:56</a>
My friend won a Big Mac and ran off like go stole it and was screaming “LeTS gO TO mACcAs”
Imagine the people&#39;s reactions of getting notifications that he hearted their comment, and then they watch this and see he was just using you as an example
my dad: il be back in 20 min.<br>Me :*sees this video* :  Pikachu surised face
Number one: Excessive quick edits/cuts. My god.
If u haven&#39;t noticed, Azzyland almost always copies sssniperwolf.
Pewds is being overly critical on people being overly critical
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=193">3:13</a> what about Sean
Pewds: <b>dissing podcasts</b><br><br>The BroKen podcast: Am I a joke to you?
Some video ads are straight up 3 minutes long
I got an ad for Pewdiepie Dbrand merch on this video
YouTube Staff was shaking watching this video
pewds: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=192">3:12</a><br>mrbeast is sweating
this whole video is just Felix being a fat mood for 21 minute straight.
Hallö stöp......byeee
Dude really just said &quot;hardwear.&quot;
Just realized this video is sponsored by &#39;raid shadow legend&#39;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=176">2:56</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=191">3:11</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=360">6:00</a> it&#39;s kind of Mr. Beast expose video 😂😂
Who’s watching in 2020?
Pewdiepie all youtubers who was loud intros should be clicked off of immediately:<br>Sad MrBeast noises
This is why I love pewds he is the best I wish there were more smart YouTubers  like him
MAKING FUN OF JONTRON... OK KEEP MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE WHO PUT x20 MORE EFFORT IN THEIR VIDEOS THAN YOU DO
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=284">4:44</a> it&#39;s same what u doing!.
Omg I thought sniperwolf and azzie were the same person.<br>Either way they&#39;re both annoying and useless
Just get an ad blocker guys
i love how the thumbnail has also the red background lol
5. Offering prize on videos<br>Pewds-it&#39;s just that u can&#39;t do anything now there has to be 10 grands on line<br><br><b>Mr. Beast</b> :
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=332">5:32</a> he do be treating jerian like that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=291">4:51</a> for all the nf stans
get a add blocker for YouTube as a chrome extension
haha poopie go <b>brrrrrrr</b>
Shave the beard pewds
must be a mannequin behind those legs, can&#39;t be possible...
Also the comment section is freaking annoying. Everyone copies the same stupid meme from 2010 and they get upvoted. If you wany to find some normal comments than you have to scroll down for like a minute.
the reason youtubers bait you to comment, is because the more comments, the more likely it is to hit the algorithm and get recommended to lots of people.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=353">5:53</a> the notes are literally glued on the glass lol
nah that too polished thing is exactly what happened to rwj. he even got a newer younger youtuber for his channel to replace HIM like that&#39;s the next step when they&#39;re just polishing none stop. polish the youtuber and officially everything we loved about the channel is gone. they aren&#39;t just disconnected. he flat out checked out on us.
ha
can we just talk about that morgs thumbnail...
Dude that game looks terrible I can&#39;t wait for you to stop advertising it at the end of every video lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=350">5:50</a> sad mrbeast noises
When creators say they will see us in  the next one and I&#39;m like no you wont😑
taking notes in order to not be a stinky youtube
my pet peeve is people who screams into their mic telling us to subscribe and give them 10 Quintillion likes.
Felix was drinking out of a sippy cup for some reason.
a pet peeve i have is when they&#39;re talking about how they have depression if you really do try to get help and start talking to people about it instead of making a video about it
WillNE did it for a joke
HE USED AZZY
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=928">15:28</a> You&#39;re talking about Love not Like. The thumbs up is Like. Just click the Like not the Love.
Make this most liked video for rewind 2020
Bye
If pewds gets a podcast it’s just gonna be him , Edgar , and a tambourine
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=292">4:52</a> Well Felix, you might not care, but some people do
Yes it is
Goes to find out why joe rogan wont do hot ones lmao
I’m watching with my dog.<br><br><br><br><br>she’s floor gang.
&quot;boomer hates youtube meta&quot;<br>I want somebody to throw the script for the raid shoutout and adlib it, but throw some sincere feedback, good or bad.
YouTuber&#39;s that are like &quot;oMg gUy&#39;s cOmMenT wHat yOu tHinK iS gOinG tO hAppEn!!!&quot; As if it wouldn&#39;t happen in the next 5 seconds. This is mainly kids channels.
i just watched pewdiepie hating on everything present  on youtube
When felix rants about raidshadowlegends but literally does the same exact things
Bbc
Anyone Else Just Cycle Through PewDiePie vids
Mrbeast does the dumb face for his gaming channel now <br>It&#39;s sad
I just bought the floor gang membership (tier 3) I don’t regret
Isn&#39;t the red from the youtube guides for getting clicks made by youtube?
I like how Sive put his own Raid Shadow Legends shout out in the video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=530">8:50</a>)
Who else clicked on the thumbnail bc it had a picture of Azzy from AzzyLand in it?
Yes Felix! 2x speed ftw
YouTube becoming  shit. These practices should be moderated better.
Pewds : azzy and sniper wolf...they look so similar <br>Me: WHAT THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PERSON?
Are ya really reading these comments, ARE YOU!!! Prove it 🤪
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=290">4:50</a> NF watching this 👁👄👁👍
I double tapped a couple of times and your video ended
I always get sssniperwolf &amp; Azzyland confused
click bait
Nah I hate podcasts
The worse thing about this video is<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>It has ending
Pewds when he was younger: &quot;then maybe consider subscribing&quot; <br>Pewds now: &quot;SUBSCRIBE NOW!&quot; &quot;ALEXA CAN WE HIT 500k LIKES ON THIS VIDEO!?&quot;
Pewdiepie: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=181">3:01</a> <br>Jack:...
Make it black
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=328">5:28</a> Felix became ceiling gang for a second😳
you mean unpolished like a floor
I thought im the one who realize nowadays that almost all youtubers doing podcasts.
I watch 4 hours + PewDiePie, now I&#39;m having nightmare where Felix become CEO of  YouTube
when someone has overly high quality equipment for their low quality content.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=350">5:50</a> sad mr beast sounds
its kinda funny that pewdiepie hates all of these things but he has done half of them
Sniperwolf &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; azzy
I think he was very angry this day
“If a video starts off super intensive it should be a sign to click off the video” Jack: DInG DInG DiNG TOP OF MORnING
SPY NINJASSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Azzy and Sniperwolf are the same person<br><br>Change my mind
What about how the titles are in ALL CAPS
tags: satire
Big up willne for getting in the vid
These videos hit different when you’re high on acid lol
PewDiePie changed logo?
I’m still waiting for a Pewdiepie podcast
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=192">3:12</a> SKRATTAR DU FÖRLORAR DU
I hate it when a YouTuber I really like uses a sleazy tactic for subs...<br>So there&#39;s a YouTuber called Fundy and he makes really good Minecraft content with some brilliant coding. Well he now does this thing Where he&#39;ll say that due to a YouTube glitch people are being unsubbed from the channel. This is bullshit and he knows it. But he continues to do it and it really makes me lose respect for the guy.
Azzyland is one of the worst YouTubers on the platform deal with it
The background little beep things sounded like my fridge opening lmao
I appreciate Felix not changing his camera until its difficult to work with. That&#39;s how electronics should be used, all electronics have rare earth elements in them and if you keep on changing them frequently the elements will vanish soon enough and we&#39;ll go back to living in cave. So don&#39;t change any electronic device until its broken.
At the National Helium Reserve in Amarillo, Texas, the US government once stored 32 billion cubic feet of helium. There have been breathless news articles recently saying the world&#39;s running out: but it&#39;s still possible to buy party balloons. What&#39;s going on? - You made me watch this
The funny thing about this is the fact that mrbeast hits almost every single of the bad things pewds talks about this video, which means that either people just change or, every single person on youtube does not care anymore xD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=556">9:16</a> Rare footage of pewdiepie legs
Slow? Watch Viva Frei.
my pet peeve  is the &quot;lIkE If YOu AgREe&quot; comments  also the edited comments<br><br>like if you agree
He had to put on the prosthetics for the Christmas merch plug
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=591">9:51</a> why is your pet named peeve
This might have been the first video of him announcing and actually referencing poopdie and now it&#39;s coming out on the Nintendo Switch!
When they start off “HEY GUYS” or during the entire video they do “how fast can you like challenges”
What I hate most about YouTube:<br><br>Who has been a follower of XYZ YouTuber before 2020 😇 (followed by this fucking halo emoji every time)<br><br>Edit: OMG thanks for whatever likes. Never got these many likes before.<br><br>Don&#39;t look at my profile pic. Followed by don&#39;t click on my channel, etc etc.<br><br>I am a small artist with big dreams, watch my latest video. I hope you all will like my channel, please follow guys.😊😊<br>(this is specially annoying when they start by actually praising the video and then casually go on to plug their channel)<br><br>Who agree with me like (and other variations of this messed up grammar)<br><br>Writing perfect English followed by (sorry for bad English guys)<br><br>I&#39;m subbing to whoever subs me<br><br>Comments with channel name 20,000 subscribers before 2021.<br><br>Who is watching in December 2020 hit like.<br><br>Jake Paul.
how to clean bird. they had a camera for 3 years.
Ok he used the face in the thumbnail.  Why has his shirt changed colour 🤨
Roc and Ks: Coincidence, Pewdiepie was talking about people doing Raid: Shadow Legends, and at the end of the video, we got a Raid: Shadow Legends add. XD
I completely lost it when he said thongs😂
Was on the way to work and put my phone in my pocket. Listening to this like a podcast, check mate!
the freakin background music !!! why ?? it .. doesn&#39;t make sense !! <br>but i don&#39;t care<br>but why ?
budget vsauce
Did I see LEGS?????
I have a rant about you pewds, you leech off reddit and other peoples content and i dont like it.
F in the chat for the people who got the comment heart.
It smells bad
Don&#39;t hate on Azzy, she helped meh thru a very difficult time.
Binod
ok felix, raid sucks, but don&#39;t put internet historians ads in the montage, they are quality
I cant belive this video got ads
You are 0% annoying
I used to watch any when I was 8 and I used to accidentally click onto sniper wolfs videos
Not will 😭
Adding advertising in the body while be bombarded by Youtube advertisement.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=919">15:19</a> those 3 people probably just got really excited from those notifications, then checked and saw it was unhearted
Hrllo
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
I dont watch jacksepticeye anymore because I feel like im watching a commercial...
I really like this PewDiePie version
Why do you hate people they have their own videos
Я в игре
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=618">10:18</a> me too... 2x speed makes me happy! Just saying I&#39;m happy... No... Yes... Idk huh
Complains about red shade* uses red shade
Poor will🤣
Imagine how cringy it would be posing for the thumbnail, awkward silence and making a shitty face
E
Ssniperwolf and azyland are differentttttttt??? I didnt know lol
Azzypie in the thumbnail
Something i really like about the Just Cause games is that alot of times, the dialogue goes into the beginning of the mission, rather than having to sit through a whole shitty cutscene. It is amazing. Even though half the time i still dont give a fuck what theyre saying anyway
Sorry gay
does anyone know the song in the background around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=1110">18:30</a> mark plz ive been looking for it for a while
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=920">15:20</a> those people probably got the notification, got super excited, and went to check just to see he removed it :&#39;(
Hasn&#39;t he done raid before
pewds: * looks up something *                                                                                                                                                                                pewds: I don&#39;t care                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * keeps scrolling *                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       pewds: I DON&#39;T CARE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   just click off of it bro xD
Pewdiepie is a whole Scorpio and it shows 😂😂
This dude selling loafers for 80$ lmao
S2W
My pet peeve is when a YouTuber doesn’t recognize Simon
Those 6 random comments pewdiepie liked and their notifications the people got. When they went to check, it wasn’t there. I feel bad for em lol 😂
hi
:(
Is it me or has pewdiepie started exposing youtubers? 🤔
I like how he also put the red background thing...
Honestly, reading YouTube comments is a pet peeve. The purpose of the comment section is to give feedback and serve as a reaction, but commenters do it in such an obnoxious way. Every comment is almost like a script now. You can’t go 5 seconds without seeing something like “I’m about to end this man’s career” or “_<i>__</i> isn’t real. It can’t hurt you”.
POV: You&#39;re trying to see if he&#39;s hearted any comments
P<br>E<br>W<br>D<br>S<br>I<br>S<br>S<br>O<br>E<br>I<br>P<br>I<br>C
The dislikes are Azzyland fans saying that Azzy did not copy sniperwolf
Podcast ??? What about boner cast
Jesus loves you
Who is pewdiepies leg model?
I hate how youtubers put the thumbnails as themselves (or random people) with their mouths wide open. Like fuck it gets so annoying. Absolute bait
congrats on 106m
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=240">4:00</a> so that was a frickin lie
Who else is hear from wills video
I wonder who the leg model was in this video
fair criticism eh
Sad mr beast noises
He knows a thing or two about youtube😂
&quot;You were the chosen one&quot;
internet historian&#39;s raid shadow legends sponsorship was the funniest
<b>mr.beast left the chat</b>
Shane dawson acting like a broke slob when he&#39;s a millionaire
i could very much use those stupid gloated 10k for my student loans :/
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=26">0:26</a> love how he added the tiny bit of red in the thumbnail too lmao
Если уж будет выбор между Либра и Грамм, то однозначно выберу Грамм.
pewdiepie tu es le roi de youtube.<br>si vous savez ce que je dis, vous avez probablement utilisé google translate<br><br><br><br><br>hi i know English too
anyone else thinks Pewds looks reeeaaally tired?
I hate it when you tubers like sniper wolf half ass the things that they do on their channel just so they can say life hack didn&#39;t work or they want to be funny
I love how poopdie came out on my bday
Why tf every comments were about him
When pewds talks about point 5: That girl ripped Mr Beasts idea of giving away money.
Theo baker sneaking in
I once got over 4k likes on a comment pointing out white privilege in a video and then 1k likes on another comment defending people with autism. Even though most of my comments go unnoticed, occasionally I get a good response and it feels so much better getting likes for what I really think than trying to fish for likes by copy and pasting the same old comments/formats. I always get annoyed when people are like &quot;edit: omg I&#39;ve never gotten so many likes before!!! This is a record thank youuuu!!!!&quot; And the comment is always shallow and not original at all. Why are these people so proud to get likes? It&#39;s not because they&#39;re happy that people agreed with/thought they&#39;re joke was funny, they are just happy to get attention which is pretty shallow and annoying. My advice is to just be yourself and stop fishing for likes (you may not get the likes you want but you&#39;ll be way more interesting and have interesting conversations in the replies)
sorry about the background noise... <br>meanwhile off camera: GET BACK IN THE KITCHEN SUSANNNNN<br>a little later: wtf Susan why are you out of the kitchen, and why did the captive come out of the Dungeon<br>on camera: H E Y   G  U Y S!!!!! I took care of those childr- uh workers <br>off camera in basement: kiddos who wants the industrial drill <br>on camera: sorry guys my slave- uh I mean hardworking wife is USING THE BLENDER AGAIN<br>off camera: SUSAN shut up or else you&#39;ll end up like the captives
Ayye just noticed WillNE
I know that this is an old video, but I am so glad that pewds saw the internet historian RAID ads. I actually watch their ads because they&#39;re really funny.
What music is that in the background????
if u wanna skip 5 sec in a youtube video when u r watching it on pc. JUST USE THE RIGHT ARROW KEY PEWDIEPIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS SIMPLE. hope u read it and it also helps ;p &quot;winky emoji&quot; XD
Pewds talking about 10k vids meanwhile mrbeast is mostly about that exact thing(I love mr beast I’m not tryna hate on him)
Red colour has the shortest wavelength and easy for the eyes to pick it up. That&#39;s why they use red colour
Jesus loves you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=242">4:02</a>
;-;
Another weird things some youtubers do is liking hate comments...
For some reason i read the title “Youtube is Skinny”
S T I N K Y
Bruh at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=460">7:40</a> I thought someone was calling me. It&#39;s that Samsung life
Exactly felix I just love seeing people&#39;s reaction thats why i am here right now
I read the comments and it not my video
I actually thought azzy and ssniperwolf were the same person  for a while.
I haven’t watched the vid but my pet peeve of YouTubers is when they  sound so fake! Like they’re so outgoing there’s nothing wrong with being outgoing I’m outgoing! but just extending it to the limit where it’s almost creepy!  :/
I wonder what Pewdiepie thinks of Leafy 🤔🤔🤔
I can see gamer sweat
Hallo
&quot;Not everyone needs a podcast,&quot; H3H3 callout????!!??
pyrocinical and internet historian got called out during the raid shadow legends rant oof
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=417">6:57</a><br><br>: <b>Davie504 is shaking</b><br><br><br><b>SLAP LIKE NOW</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=355">5:55</a> <br><br><br>: <b>mr. Beast is shaking</b>
the poor people who thought it was yiay and answered ironicly
&quot;boring dialogue in game&quot;<br>me over here doing the dragonborn dlc in skyrim where the hermorus mora dialogue is un-skippable like T - T
Wait... does Felix have 2 different eye colors?!?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=920">15:20</a> : their best day ever<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=922">15:22</a> : gone
Raid shadow legends and NordVPN are sponsoring a lot of french youtubers as well and some of them are making the most hilarious ads possible, if you understand french I suggest you go see &quot;Joueur du grenier&quot; and &quot;LinksTheSun&quot; &#39;s latest videos for that
Felix can you please tell me the name of the music playing at the end of the video
I noticed that and it made me maddd and like in the picture thing they don&#39;t act or idk what it says  or shows in the picture
I hate when gamers yell into there mic. It&#39;s like.. OMG WHY ARE U YELLING
What about TIKTOK ads?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=514">8:34</a> What about Internet Historian dude
Tasty<br>-Context matters
Pewdiepie was calling out mr beast straight out in number 5
If anyone wanted to know, the helium question guy was Tom Scott
Yo optimus is in this video
I was just nodding my head during this whole video
lol
I just love messing around with the place he&#39;d turning it super fast and super slow on Felix&#39;s videos because it makes them 50 times funnier
Let&#39;s be real the thing that is the most fucked is the YouTube algorithm
“Legs”.     ... wait that’s illegal
Legs revealed
help me beat T-series, let&#39;s make Youtube great again!
Actually the face sniperwolf is making. Pewdiepie does it too... not the same face but the “dramatic” face, check some of the thumbnails of other vids.
Just watched &quot;why planes dont fly over the pacific ocean&quot;
dude your vfx are getting realy good! like when you were doing your ad for the sweaters and pants, you made fully cgi legs like dude thats awesome
My pet peeve is “wHo’S wAtChiNG iN 2o21?”
I bet those people he hearted was so excited that they got a notification pewdiepie hearted their comment but then he unhearted them
Are the legs detachable?

OPTIMUS ON PEWDIEPIE VIDEO??? <br><br><br>WOOOOOOOOOOT?
&quot;If you click on any video that just starts immediately super intensive, then it should be a sign to just click off immediately.&quot;<br><br>MrBeast: 0.o
This is just a &quot;How to youtube&quot; tutorial video
Sven is forever the best
I think the trending page is horrendous. It’s filled with Emma chamberlain, Joanna ceddia, YouTube “family” channels recording thier life every 10 seconds like “HAD TO GET HER THE ER!” “NEW GENDER BABY REVEAL!” and music of artists people don’t know about. General interesting stuff is hard to see on the trending, like stop. I don’t want to watch the day before you go into labor. It’s annoying. I think we can all agree we don’t want to hear “we broke up” from a relationship that lasted a week from someone who we don’t know.

Pet peeve: gacha youtubers they shouldn’t even be a “YouTuber” it’s just cringey kids...,my god!
Pewdipie: why does every youtuber has to give money?<br>Mr beast: 👁👄👁
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=332">5:32</a>
Who else is watching old pewdiepie videos during quarantine
i feel so bad for the comments he liked then unliked
I bought a pair of last year&#39;s lounge pants off of uglychristmassweaters because of this video. It&#39;s June.
Can we have zooms in the video<br>Brad: Yes
“Why doesn’t the heart get tired ?”-youtube
Remember when being a youtube is frown upon. But now everyone has a channel. Even my nephews has their own channels
what is the music at the end of the video ?
&quot;We got legs.&quot;<br><br>Lies
He is not floor gang
Me too <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=617">10:17</a> <br>now I know it&#39;s normal 😓
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=560">9:20</a> he has legs? what?
i also think dragon raja is better than raid
ريد شادو ليجيند ما ادري وش هي نفس حالة صراع السلاطين عندنا🌚
i hate when youtubers ask to like and subscribe, and promote sponsors at the start of the video. like, if i genuenly like the video, then i&#39;m gonna like it. but i do get that, there&#39;s a rule, that sponsors have to be credited somewhere, where watchers can see it. no in the end credits, but middle, or beginning.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=994">16:34</a> keem star be like
Personally I just like shit talking people  in the comments
LMAO MOE IS IN THE VID XDD
Pewdiepie, how could put same on mr beast
D A M N half the things in this vid were them most passive-aggressive pieces of text ever.
Its annoying how YouTubers copy each others intros. Its so annoying.
: )
We know mr beast then.
I don’t like watching crisp and high quality videos (cam/setup) either. A normal medium quality like urs is much more friendly to watch.
He has legs!<br>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=565">9:25</a>)
you sound like peter griffin in the outro game ad. good job
If you read the comments like this
&quot;I hate pointless rewards&quot;<br><br>Mr beast has left the chat
Lmao during this video I got an add from a YouTuber promoting himself
sssniperwolf and azzy land are just like the same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=69">1:09</a>
Wow this guy looks like pewdiepie.
willne actually made a video to respond
Omg i just downloaded poopdie and love it.  I also love all your vids
I dont like azzyland or sssniperwolf 😅
Are..Are....are you DISSING mrbeast?? &quot;there has to be SOME money on the line..&quot; but..but...mrbeast.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=360">6:00</a> number 5 is  mrbeasts career
LEGS!? LIAR!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=804">13:24</a><br>well toby fox didnt hire anyone for undertale<br>and the game was still amazing<br>Edit: he didnt hire any writers
hi pewds I just wanna say that even though I&#39;m a newer fan I still really like your content and I hope you see this
Not have 1000 subs <br><br><br><br><br>Lol <br>Not
When you realize that you pay 10k to sive to edit your videos
Felix should make a video combining all of the things he talked about in this video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=344">5:44</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=350">5:50</a> = discount Mr.Beast
I hate when YouTubers have 20ping and are screaming I’m lagging
Igfjfhhg skadooooosh
Morgz=cringe and small brain<br>Leave a like or a reply if you agree
30-60 minute gaming videos where all I see in the webcam is a fucking forehead. Also just how unfriendly the platform is for creators and viewers. It&#39;s a shitty platform but it&#39;s all there is.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=191">3:11</a> why you got to do Jack like that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=640">10:40</a> pewds your good deed is making some of the best youtube content there is so don&#39;t say you don&#39;t do good deeds.
You should have watched nf&#39;s why
Why is pewdiepie so handsome
Pewdz forehead is so shiny :)
Omg these pet peeves are so relatable tbh, morgz is one of the most cringe since he does almost every one of them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=708">11:48</a> I do understand what you mean and can relate
Me: sees morgz face<br>Volume: guess I&#39;m going down.
I like azzyland ,sssniperwolf  and u
Raid shadow legends is such a s*it pay to win game
you forgot to include the pointless merch, socia media crap in the start/middle/end of a video

It&#39;s not a bad thing to put why on a thumbnail, I&#39;m a student and it good to have this, but I can see why you would say it dosen&#39;t matter
Towards the end of the vid can someone tell me what the background song is called please
youtube: wants longer videos<br>me: makes 5 second video called &quot;MINECRAFT&quot; of just the minecraft menu screen
I just realized Pewds is fucking handsome
When I see editing I imagine the person working on it.
Those people were probably so excited when he liked their comments. Then he just unliked them 😂
Pewdiepie what sup
Finally someone I can relate with
Thank you for the helpful advice. &lt;3 :D I am just starting out and I think this is useful. :)
I know felix is not gonna read my comment bcs this is a old vid
pewdiepie is canceling his future self just sayn
Bro
Pyrocynical finally got in a PewDiePie video
My worst pet peeve is like 5 minute long intros
Does anyone else hate scripted content?
The funny thing is years ago grade a under a did something similar that was written off as drama
the dislikes are cancer youtubers
To be fair though,  some people naturally just go on tangents.  They might not do it because they &quot;think it&#39;s cool&quot; or whatever, but they may just easily get distracted &amp; talk about a subject(s) for a while, stating their opinions on it.<br>I know I go on tangents a lot when it&#39;s something I&#39;m passionate about or have strong opinions on, but I definitely don&#39;t do it because I think it&#39;s cool.<br>I hate fads so much XD I will purposely do the opposite even if it&#39;s something I already liked doing.
Next title for YouTube video --- &quot; Does Pewdiepie really care if you put a question in your title? &quot;
And now every youtuber in this video will make a 10 minute video about how you mentioned them.
I think for people like Linus tech tips the super high quality is warranted his company is a tech company so showing off an 8k red camera but for like vlog Chanels all you need is your phone or a pocket camera that can record at 1080p 60fps and I don’t understand People needing like 14 f stops in a 2000$ DSLR anyway that’s just my opinion
pewd:youtube stinks<br>pewd:ok were back in mincraft
When I first started watching YouTube I thought that azzyland and ssaniperwolf were the same person.
How many views this vid gets is how many times pewds said &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot;
Cwc suck
i agree very heavily, thank you felix, very epic !
Way to tell people to stop watching Jacksepticeye
Well shit I forget what I’m talking about constantly and go on tangents all the time 😂 guess I can’t be a YouTuber
Felix: Reads comment about how too many advertisements are fit into one portion of a video and agrees <br>Also Felix: BEHOLD! FOR TOO LONG YOU HAVE BEEN FARTING IN THE DARKNESS! (Wtf)
I feel like azzyland tries to copy sssniperwolf alottt
HOW. Do you watch videos at 2X speed???
Kwebbelkop play you game in a video &amp; you make a video about kwebbelkop suck
A YouTuber I knew used that same I have 5 face options for a video thumbnail thing but then she got her hair dyed so instead of taking new photos she just went to photoshop and changed the color of her hair
YOU SHOWED YOUR LEG
Talking about thumbnails and not talking about Ali a
my pet peeve is when youtubers are like, &#39;that was bad, i should edit that out&#39; like... just edit it out then
Was excited for Pewdiepie Thongs (as in the things you put on your feet) and was brutally disappointed....
Wost when I&#39;m reading comments and a ad pops up and I lose my place
Pewds:searches up &quot;why&quot;<br>Also pewds:&quot;SHUT UP&quot; &quot;STOP&quot;
Reddit wont let me post meme for you :c
&quot;If anything I want YouTube to do well&quot;<br><br><br>Literally titles video: YouTube is stinky
Internet historians raid ad read is great
Nice bro
Hmm..
What about the BONERCAST
Woah Felix actually watched Tom Scott&#39;s videos lol
Pewdiepieeeeeeeeeee
I mean if a YouTuber interiors<br>The video with an advertisement I skip<br>It dislike the video. If they ask for a like or sub I dislike them on both this and my two alt accounts.
I miss when the internet and youtube were lawless wastelands
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=695">11:35</a> and now hes on the floor... When you listen to you&#39;re own advice too much..
The red in the tumb nail
Youtubers talking slow to make the video longer :<br>Burger  king   Foot   Lettuce   The  last   Thing  you    Want     In    Your    Burger   Is    Someone’s     Foot     In     It    !

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=1097">18:17</a><br>This is true for Shane Dawson but he knows what it&#39;s like to live off of welfare because he did as a child.
hi pewds-who-reads-the-comments<br>thanks for adressing this ^-^
There is no good did out there which was left unpunished

Leg reveal
I really like him taking about stuffs like this. I hope he have an updated version on this kind of topic especially now that I think yt will join the streaming world for esport games.
With Raid shadow legends you get 50,000 gold no matter what lol
Sive...wtf?! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=532">8:52</a>
first world problèmes everybody
What is this Budget Vsauce? <br>No, actually that&#39;s UK Vsauce.
Big pp
I believe this channel was able to get the contract for raid shadow legends, ya know  the one that&#39;s given to anyone who gets sponsored by them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=619">10:19</a>
I love u
when the god of youtube starts ranting about trends that you&#39;ve been doing, thats when you know you&#39;ve been making youtube videos wrong this whole time.
Pewdiepie is me pet peeve lel get rekt scrub
♥️♥️♥️♥️
I’ve been a bro since 10,000 subs
Can confirm that lots of red does not always work and get you lots of views
At least The Internet Historian makes his ads entertaining enough to wanna watch them.
Sometimes I go on a tangent and end up forgetting what I was originally talking about, but that&#39;s just my poor memory.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=386">6:26</a> like mrbeast
I have never related to this as much than anything...
0:6 and he said he isn’t annoying
Every you tuber “sorry for no upload I was having trouble with the move”
I just don&#39;t get bored rewatching his older videos. Floor Gang ouh!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=460">7:40</a> sad Linus noises
All raid shadow legends ads are the same. Excuse me. Internet historian does not approve
One of those raid shadow legends review  was pyrocynical and he was being sarcastic in the review
Felix needs to play Trine. Actual entertaining monologs/dialogs are rare. And Trine is epic. It can be played alone or with friends, and is just as fun both ways.
Noice
Videos I hate : last to breathe gets 1 Billion dollars
Well its a trend using red background.. Bcoz it has the longest wavelength,  it can travel long distance, so ur eyes get easily attracted to that particular thumbnail among other thumbnails. Corridor crew did a whole video on that.
Pewds: If a video starts immediately being super intensive then- it&#39;s a sign you should click off of it right away.<br>Jack: <b>TOP OF THE MORNIN&#39; TO YA</b>
Simon Whistler is budget Vsauce! LMFAO. I don&#39;t know, he has a really fancy British accent that adds a bit more value.
I bet pewdiepie wont read this comment
Willne showed you right up 😂
PewDiePie should start a podcast
But pewds stop.being a hypocrite you do the same clickbeats
Pewds will read this <br>He might be entertained by this<br>he may consider liking<br>he will like it<br>he will unlike it<br>then he will make a video about it<br>that video will get 7 million views<br>prove me wrong
Pewds will read this <br>He might be entertained by this<br>he may consider liking<br>he will like it<br>he will unlike it<br>then he will make a video about<br>that video will get 7 million views<br>prove me wrong
I came from WILLNE anyone else?
i liked pewds when he was more negative like in this video <br>i still like him but hes just too happy and rainbows
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVo2eyjSjZ8&amp;t=920">15:20</a><br>Pewds: <b>Hearts Comment</b><br>Commenter: :D<br><br>Pewds: <b>Removes Heart</b><br>Commenter: D:
I was wondering why Felix was using the same photo for a month in his thumbnails.
Sniper is way hotter
Budget vsauce!!!<br><br>Now thats a rare insult
