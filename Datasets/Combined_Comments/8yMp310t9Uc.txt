Abnormal behavior of a stranger
When kjo used make good movies..
I think best work of Karan Johar it was good movie as always ahead of its time...don&#39;t forget this movie was based out of India for higher class and may be this must be a true story...

I love how in rab ne bana di jodi has a callback to this dialogue (intentional or unintentional ) don&#39;t say goodbye tani partner just say hum hai raahi pyaar ke phir milenge chalte chalte
Love this scene..you shouldn&#39;t marry someone without loving them..this scene has a separate fan base
Put. This.  Movies.  Youtube.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yMp310t9Uc&amp;t=79">1:19</a> Dev ko apni biwi ka naam bhi nahi aata thik se <br>Her name is Riya not Diya 🤣
If SRK ever had to make his CV, he cannot miss this scene to include in his resume...
Personally yeah movie mujhe bahut pasand aayi thi maine iss movie 🎥 ko Mumbai theatre main 7 baar dekha tha I am not Fan of SRK but whenever I saw SRK movie I Love him
Please upload full movie
Aesi Film Karan Johar ki ho sakti hai 😂😂😂😂.<br>Shadi karne ja Rahi abhi Tak clear nhi pata 😂😂😂😂.
SRK ❤❤❤❤ so cute 🥰🥰🥰❤️
Did he say &#39;diya&#39;?@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yMp310t9Uc&amp;t=84">1:24</a>
নেহি ঢুন্ডো গে তো নেহি মিলেগা❤😂❤😂
I don’t know why I enjoy watching Srk playing a jealous character……
In today&#39;s world no body is your&#39;s
I don&#39;t believe in the relationship.
His wife and wife and children should give punishment by every god and society.
If a guy can&#39;t give a woman that respect he doesn&#39;t have the play with her emotions.
Why he gives him his Wife&#39; place.
Maya actually loves him.
He must give punishment.
Why she used Maya emotion.
Dev is the third class character.
Is se pta chlta he orat ko prde me rehns chaye n mrd ko nzr neechwe
Wow
Nice Emotional since....thrughtly Life......
666😮
Ok,,,Phir milenge,
If maya and dev had a good life , maya had kids and dev dint meet with the accident would they have still fallen for each other or stayed  true and loyal to their partners. <br>Was it circumstance which brought them apart from their spouse?
This scene is so sweetttt
Only SRK can deliver this kind of phenomenal acting while eating a chewing gum 👌👌👌👌👌
When I first watched the scene, I almost cried on the background song in spie of language gap. Idk why but this movie has successfully made me do some reflections of what I had to go through. The scene had me right from the start.
Sooch kar koon Shaadi karta Hain,,,nice quip
Love sharukhan😍
SRK means:-<br>Sharukh <br>Rani 😂<br>Kajol🤣
When u realize  the garden is hugeeeee....
The songs and background score of this movie are amazing. Dialogues were written beautifully. It was an underrated movie. I like this movie alot. It explores a different side from usual. And is just like life. You don&#39;t know if you&#39;re decision at the time will render right or wrong in future (Rani&#39;s decision of marrying Abhishek). But you still make them in the hope for the best, sometimes they disappoint, sometimes they&#39;re the best that you&#39;ve made. This movie takes this &quot;wrong decision&quot; approach and the it was excellently directed and acted. Don&#39;t know why this movie gets alot of hate.
This movie is opposite of veer zara, in veer zara, rani is helping so that preity and srk could meet and here she&#39;s in between them.
This is what karan Johar is capable of making &amp; writing. This KJo should return.
One thing about this movie is awestrucking  music it has,  apart from its infedility which is extremely wrong .....
This movie is Ahead of time ..

I love  too movies 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Nices  movie  🌹,🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
This was some dialogue, direction, and acting. Everyone nailed it to perfection. One for the ages. Damn you Karan Johar for degrading yourself with SOTY, ADHM, &amp; Rocky aur Rani shite.

Addicted to this scene
I&#39;ll appreciate the story writer and dialogues writer....ek aise issue ko point  out kiya hai...jis per kabhi kuch na likha gya na banaya gya....jab ki aise bhi log hai jo is trah ki problem face krte hain aur mentally boht stress ke saath jeete hain
❤🦋❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I just love so much how effortlessly these actors nailed the characters they played.. those days were all so goddamn fine. New Bollywood completely lost it, sucks! Talk about performances but all they do is about looking good only, but sucks anyways 😂 <br>I love when Bollywood movies full of Shahrukh, Rani Mukherjee, Kajol, Madhuri, Amir, Abhishek, Aishwarya Rai, Preity Zinta, Saif Ali Khan where those days all these faces doing movies frequently..
Best friends are best life partners
Khushiyo ka Rasta...jo tumhe mile...best line...nahi dhoondhogi to nahi milegi...thanks...
Super
2 well dressed people.. awesome shot... nice background music and depth of soul in dialogues..
Tum maali ho?🤣
The emotion master,only Karan Johar can make this.
Why are her hands so dark...😏?
The 5  best movies of srk are DDLJ, Kal ho na ho, Kuch kuch hota hai, kabhi alvida na kehna, kabhi khusi kabhi gham.
Srif mere liye itna kharca!
Most bollywood movies are idiotic
My favourite movie ❤️❤️❤️
Ajeeb aadmi ho baith bhi gaye<br><br><br><br>Lait ke baat karu
&quot;Nahi dhoondogi toh nahi milegi&quot; so true...wish both of them would have followed this...
What a shit acting ! Over acting and no sense in dialogues delivery ! No wonder he is flip actor these days
👍👍👍
Best wishes......<br>But Jodi ......
main kisi se advice nahi leta hai lakin dusro ko advice dene k liye hamesa taiyet hai😊😊😊

Kabhi alvida na kahna🖤srk

This 3 min is so meaningful..
wowww nice song, l like it
One of the best scenes, sometime we need a stranger like this in our life 👍
When you realize that this is the same bench from Kuch kuch hota hai

Very natural. Recorded real time with no dubbing for once ! It makes such a difference to express emotions properly.
She should never have married. She wasn&#39;t in love. Maybe it was too difficult for her to get out of.
Very nice movie

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yMp310t9Uc&amp;t=218">3:38</a> he said the irony sentence!!!!
I dont think dev and maya were selfish. They were helpless because they were in love. Everything fails infront of love.

Sarukhan sir best
Rani mukherji eyes are soo beautiful
I love this scene
Nothing Greater than SRK&#39;s Acting,...🔥🤩
Ye srk nai fan ka imposter hai😂
Srk    always  love u     acting     is  no doubt  always  fantastic.   Rani   too
hair..just look at his damn hair.. i&#39;m jealous
That pchhak in the end by srk..
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Please aplod full movie
I relate to each and every comment on this video,it was really way ahead of it&#39;s time and deserves a totally unbiased opinion of a person ,just like srk  dying in khnh was not acceptable but did happen, love after marriage also happen. Does that mean srk wouldn&#39;t make movies with him dying ,no,will this movie change my opinion for marriage ,also no
Sahrukh khan ki filmo
which movie<br>&gt;????
I love the fact that this film is not dubbed, but recorded real-time. It means the actors can put real emotion into their scenes instead of sitting in a studio &amp; trying to recreate dialogue (which never sounds natural).
It&#39;s pretty nostalgic 💜
Nice movie 👌👌
I hate Rani in this movie
l like shahrukh khan
Demi Lovato
Gods
MY heart love move forward with Rani Mukherjee ❤️❤️ nice to meet you ❤️❤️
Rani I love you so much 💕
I love❤❤❤❤ all my friends👭👬👫
Karan Johar, you have become filthy. That&#39;s why dislike this video even if this scene is beautiful.

Hii
One fantastic pair.. love seeing them together.. misses them so much.. kudos to Rani and Shah Rukh.. can someone  please set the pace once more and team them up together.. for the love of their fans..
We need more srk-Rani movies.
👌👌👌👌
I don&#39;t know what magic this background music has.. Whenever I listen to this music I completely lost myself.. This movie released when I was in 8th standard. But still it got my nerves.
Ohhhhhh my Gawwwwd ! How beautiful is the scene😍😍😍 SRK is just pure magic! God bless you!
Waw
I LOVE this film. It did much better in the UK &amp; Europe than India. Well done Karan. Great story, great writing. The way it tackled forbidden love was spot-on. Love it. And the songs of course.
Sometimes within whole life its impossible to understand  close relations and some people change life with trust,love,friendship.
Hit
This is called versatile acting ! one and only SRK ♥️

I just love rani mukherjee&#39;s voice❣️
Bass shaadi unse karo jise dil se pyar ho or feeling unconditional or ek alag hi ehsas h unse karo..per dost hai to shaadi karo  use mohobatt hai ..es lie per jo uper feeling kahi  esa ho to hi karo .....shaadi...suna hai shaadi k bat pyar katam ho jata h ...per do couple chahe na to ny katam hota per jina ana chahie or pyar hota hai to life me kitne bhude ho jaye per pyar vo hi rehta h...
Mohabbat ka zamana gya ,chote mote piyar sehi kam chalalo ......100% sahi baat

Okay good bye taken back as per your words. Only bye
The worst movie of the World.
This film KANK was a big disappointment for me. Such big stars but poor storyline. Also, what really frustrated me was that Abhishek performance was better than SRK when really it should have been the other way round. Guys what do you think???
BGM is irresistible......... <br>Kabhi alvida na kehna

Rani I  love her voice
After marriage you don&#39;t need Love but half dozen children to live in Reality. Otherwise this whole conversation between them is childish.
Maha chutiya actor and director
I miss you rani mukherjee.. rani mukherjee was best actor in bollywood.. whole bollywood will regret her loss.. you left us so much earlier..
Such bullshit
Kaun hai ye dislike karne wale chutiye?
Mai jo kaam karta hu  galat hota hai  .jaise dosti ki dusman ban jata hai wo. Kisi se riste sudharne ki kosis ki bigad jata hai. Kisi ko madad ki to wo jyada problem me ho jata hai. Mere se log nafrat karte hai. Mai akela hu.
Rain mukharji ji  aap ki acting  ki  koi  jawab nahi
Srk.... Sometimes acts as amitabh bacchan...
Cuma di film ini aku gak bisa benci dengan perselingkuhan,,tema yg unik
Real life me bhi kabhi kisiko alwida na kahe , never say goodbye . Hamesha yahi kahe &quot; down the road we meet again😊&quot;

This entire conversation was so amazingly well written. Deep layered dialogues, lil&#39; comical but will give u a glimpse what this movie has to offer.<br>I have seen this clip many a times.nice.<br>....and..... the  piano......in the background.<br>Nailed it.
Proud to be fan of srk

not gonna lie..SRK and Rani&#39;s characters were very unlikable in this movie. Didn&#39;t deserve a happy end.<br><br>Great soundtrack and performances but bad story

real life m filmo jesa q nhi hota yrr🙁🙁
Marriage is an arrangement designed and dominated by men. Their physical needs are met but a woman keeps waiting for him to take care of her emotional needs which not many men even care about. Women suffer more in marriages than men.
Srk god of acting
in this scene, he&#39;s acting like Amitabh  Bachchan
SRK is really a good actor....pta nhi log hate q karte h
Bahut bahut mast he kya tarip karu es vidio ka tarip karke me pagal ho jaungga atna asxa he
sochkar kaun shaadi karta hai???  hahahaha.....
I cant relate to her situation.. it’s sad but that’s life..
Kabhi kabhi dosti mohabbat ki jagah le leti hai or phir mohabbat ke liye jagah nahi rahti..m

Sahi baat hai Dosti hi pyar hota hai
گاهی قلب کسی را پیشت داری که هیچوقت شاید به او وابسته نباشی و با رفتن او به او وابسته شوی و با یاد و خاطر او زندگی کنی و هرگز هم نفهمی که دل تو چقدر به او امید می داد و تو نیز با بودن او خودت را در بهار عاشقی می دانستی.نسرین.انیشتین.گل سفید کوچکتان.ماهی.
