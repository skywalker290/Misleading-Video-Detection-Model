Nobody is talking about his immediate family. Was he married or not?
Abhi kuch din baad fir party krenge kapoors
RIP to Rajiv Kapoor🙏 One question constantly coming, why nurse is holding Randhir Kapoor? There are lots of people in their Family. his wife or children or grandchildren not holding him🤔 May be they are rich😅 that&#39;s y they have private nurse.. But in our Indian Middle Class Family Members are enough to take care their Aged Parents and Grandparents ☺️ (Nurse get chance to come in front of Camera)
Poor Randhir😖
Alia bhatt is not good for Kapoor family, one by one is leaving..
RIP Bollywood 2020

Ram Teri ganga maili hogayee. ...papiyoun ke astiyan dalte dalte.....<br>Now Allah will not ask you how many film fares you brought and how many Oscars you brought...The question he will ask 1 who is your God ? 2 who is your prophet ? 3 what is your religion ? obviously first answer he will be confused out of million gods and goddesses second he has no prophets third obviously the religion which has million gods cannot be a one  God&#39;s religion...He will surely go to HELL FIRE. .
RIP 💐💐💐
