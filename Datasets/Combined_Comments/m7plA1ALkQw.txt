I searched this video to see it again
Bring this back hundred times!
ooh my times changed
it&#39;s 2023, and this phone, which I bought in 2017, still work well...can u believe it? Even by today&#39;s standard, this phone still looks great...the design is quite unparalleled..it&#39;s too bad that Xiaomi never launched newer version that retain its original design...
2023 says hold my beer
Looks like a great phone for it&#39;s time
I remember watching this and thinking it looked incredible and as good as it was gonna get. I can definitely see it’s aged at this point.<br>I love revisiting older tech.
I&#39;m here 2023. And feels like time traveling 🔥
nice phone i would like to buy one
hah we still get notches today
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=75">1:15</a> So this is how smartphones used to look like... disgusting.
This was revolutionary back in the day. It seems so normal now.
LOL this phone has smaller bezels than some smartphones in 2022
Before apple released the iphone 7 withought a headphone jack and apple did it first yeah ok apple didn&#39;t do it first xaiomi did lol  This was a Beta product before the iPhone 7 was released so technically xiaomi did it 1st Lol
Yeah That was The Future.
FUN FACT: I AM USING THIS PHONE TO WATCH THIS VIDEO
I remember seeing it for the first time 5 years back. The phone that kicked off the trend we have now.
It&#39;s still a great-looking phone, even by 2022 standards.
Whats your reaction then when you see te fold lol
here in 2021 trying to buy a new phone. IMO the future didn&#39;t live up to this. I miss my Mi Mix!
Now every phone is like this
Welp, guess algorithm is hitting round 2
It&#39;s amazing how this was revolutionary in late 2016 but is now visibly quite dated.
I found one off this in my rich people garbage hunting
2021 and I still want one. Lol. Maybe I will when my s20 is fixed
And after 4 generations they&#39;ve finally done it. A true bezel-less smartphone with the Mi Mix 4.
Still comprehensive computational.
Danggg this started it all.
Im from the future and im telling you we have no bezel at all in phones
Checking the video on 2021, and the phone is still hotter than latest iPhone.
Xiaomi was way ahead of the game, both in specs and display compared to today&#39;s phones. They pioneered today&#39;s bezeless phones. Chinese people are very innovative.
Things started from here... Xiomi always comes up with something new, interesting and innovative
i remember wanting this so bad... then Samsung and everyone decided to do the same thing and imo did it worse. i wholly dislike hole punch displays and notches although in display sensors and cameras are a good thing to replace them.
This still is one of the prettiest
Man even now this looks dated to high heavens
Although this phone started the bezelless trend. But LG should also get the credit as LG G6&#39;s design was more practical and even many manufacturers adopted LG&#39;s design.
it looks so bad now but 4 years ago that was crazy.
Crazy to think how far we&#39;ve come... In such a short time
where can i buy it in 2021 ? @Marques Brownlee
Damn,i like boxy phones
This phone is not realsed in 2020 yet
<b>Laughs with note 9</b>
I still using this phone.
2020 said Hi.
Iphone still struggling with notch lmao
this vid is alerady 4 years old?
what is the refresh rate of this
2017: mkbhd &quot;look at that future&quot;<br><br>Me: shocked<br><br>Always mkbhd: <br>- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=260">4:20</a> on the clock<br>- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=201">3:21</a> when talking about the snap 821
And now all phones follow this
wow, this used to be &quot;the&quot; bezeless smartphone. crazy how far we&#39;ve come.
Now mi mix alpha
I came back here just to see how the times have changed :)
I still use this phone everyday. This week im finnally swapping it.
this was high tech back then.  now 80 dollar phones are bezelless
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=216">3:36</a><br>The &#39;Mi&#39; in MiUi is supposed to be &#39;Me&#39;, not &#39;My&#39;. 😂
<b>Apple in 5 years time be like</b>
&#39;small chin&#39;
Where can i but xiaomi mi mix 1<br>Because its already pase out. I really want this phone compare to mi mix 2
Wow, 4 years later the iPhone still has bigger bezels
Me watching this in 2020😏
wow we&#39;ve come a far way
折叠屏 环绕屏 无法超越的革命性产品，开创了一个全新的时代。
This isn’t bezelless. It has a massive bezel at the bottom.
I want this so bad. Why isn’t it for sale? :(
Remember this? yeah it was superior back then
This phone still looks sexy in 2020
Still rockong my Mi Mix since 2017 :) always been a looker, and it&#39;s 2020 now :) even looks better and more premium from a galaxy note 10 litr
even in 2020 still look modern, i remember the first time i saw it , i was impressed
It’s 2020, very common
Lol why dis recommended 3 years later
I am from the future and yes this is the future.
2020 anyone?
I remember how much of a big deal this phone was<br>Today, literally every  phone has screens like this
奇怪的是国内mix却没什么名气，人们都在追捧华而不实为所欲为爱国牌
is it worth to buy in 2019?
Very nice. Just bought it with a coupon from Couponsfromchina. Cheers m8
I just wanna say that his voice is definitely deeper in this video.
Uhhh it still has a HUUUUUUGGEEEEE CHINN
LMAO... 2019 people
2016: Wow it&#39;s almost to the edge<br>2017: Every other manufacturer alright let me borrow that<br>2018: That&#39;s one big chin<br>2019: Oneplus 7 Pro
2 years ago we were gushing over that atrocity, now we&#39;re rocking quad HD bezel-less OLED, in display fingerprint fitted beasts and we complain about the lack of IP rating.
Hey, I came from the future. This phone has started the bezelless screen era
This is what started it all
How is this better than an lg g6 and cheaper? Dam china.
Yes I have it
The Xiaomi mix α is coming
this phone was ahead of its time, it almost matching high-end 2019 phones
i think the phone looks better than most 2018/19 phones with notches
A small chin in 2019
It has a enormous chin so it looks ugly.
The aquos crystals chin is the same size as any iphone lol
I&#39;m crying while watching this in 2019
This is what 2022 phones will look like, just with smaller chin
2019 and still, this is beautiful
Watching this video on my op7pro it&#39;s amazing how far technology has come
This intro was sooooo dope!<br>Don&#39;t know why he changed it.
If this phone will be released in 2019, everyone will but it...because stupid people are watching on the date now. Oh oh new phone 2019, we have to buy it. It doesn&#39;t matter that old phones are faster than the new ones, people dont have own word.....hype it&#39;s more important now.
The og bezeless phone
It has no way near than 91% screen to body ratio.
It&#39;s 3 sided bezzeless, not 4 sided bezzeless.
mad respect for xiaomi bringing the bezeless &amp; rounded corners god damn 2.5 years ago thats innovation
2019 any one????
打卡，今天华为mate x发布了。<br>现在回头再看，当时的小米mix开启了智能手机全面屏时代。就看华为mate x能不能开启手机折叠屏时代了
Here after the release of mi mix 3
Technology is growing fast. 🤯
Oh wow ye smol chin
“Bezel-less,” my ass. It has small bezels on the side and a relatively big bottom bezel.
Looking back at this. This phone had literally zero competition.
The phone that started the bezel less trend
When u say mkbhd i hear qbhd is it only my problem?
Crazy, huh? Today it looks nothing short of okay
I love your videos are so much satisfrying me
Remember when this got him excited?
Still the best looking phone E V E R!
The phone that started it all
Looks like a mini tablet 😁❤
Here i am 1 year later and this bezelless phone with 6gigs of ram under 500$ is pretty normal these days... 😎😎
I just came back to see what started it all
So This is first phone that have an Rounded corner before Galaxy S9,and LG or other phones that have now a Rounded corners
the mi mix is ahead of its time.
&quot;it looks like the future&quot; oohhh how right you were my friend, too bad Essential had to come out with that stupid notch and ruin it all.
Love how this was the best a year ago
6GB ram is huge.. not sure who its mated with a quad core 2.3.. minimum i was expecting octa core.. some mobiles in this range offers deca core.. plus this one has big price tag i.e. 533 USD in KSA!
Too bad to see a company coming from a gorgeous device like this, pretty innovative in design, spec, etc. Going to a iPhone X clone like the &quot;brand new&quot; Mi 8. I&#39;m kinda disappointed.
Too bad the Mix 2 and 2S use a much smaller screen. It&#39;s so irritating that the new Mi 8 ignores all the beautiful design used in the Mix and Mix 2, instead using a big notch.
I have had this phone for three months now and it is by far the BEST smartphone I have owned today.  I have the Pixel, S8, Iphone 7 Plus, etc,., and the Xiaomi Mi Mix is my ultimate daily driver.  It&#39;s very snappy when it comes to speed and I never run out of space.  I have the gold version 256GB with 6GB of ram and I just don&#39;t see me going back or to any other phone unless it can top this phone.  Durability is incredible as well as the looks.  Just waiting for that Android 8 to come to my device.
Also do a review on redmi 5 note plus
Trust me, this phone is a beast. But the camera..Hm just so so.. So Its A NO for those who like to selfie😊
My only issue is Xiaomis software .... It sucks and looks ugly
This was a great design. They messed up with the mi mix 2
Nice ornottttt
Is it very big
Give me pls
Man I never knew xiomi were so far ahead of the game!
So this is where it all started.
If you use it on 2018, would it still fit the design trend ? I&#39;m thinking of buying one since the price was cut almost half.
Still watching this video on my first gen Mi mix! :)
Its a shame the followup to this phone was smaller, they should&#39;ve offered  it in a bigger size.
256 ROM holy shiet
where did you buy it
17:9 vs 18:9 vs 18.5:9
我想要那个电话。:) 给我吗！
Now here we are, over a year later, where just about all the major phone manufacturers have adopted a near-bezel-less display. Now the Mi Mix kinda just looks....&quot;normal.&quot; Still, it&#39;s an amazing concept.
OMG sooooooooo cool
Man I didn&#39;t see your face in this video
I just bought it, had to get permission from XiaoMi to &quot;unlock&quot; the phone (so you can download their drivers for them to work in the U.S.) <br>10/10 would recommend, even with the hassle. It&#39;s literally half the price of its competitors, you can find them for like $600 USD online, whilst other phones are like easily 1200+ here!
I got mines for $300 I love it
One word<br>Whooooaaaaaaa
How does the camera compare with the camera on the Xperia Z3?
What kind of couch is that?
2016: OMG A BEZEL LESS PHONE<br>2018: WTF A BEZELED PHONE IM NOT BUYING IT
6gb of ram, 256gb of storage, bezel less, nd 500$. Wow.
2018 anyone?
i love xiaomi
i dont know how many times have i watched this video...i am happy to get this beast
I&#39;ve seen this phone for sale (used) from someone living in Arizona, but I&#39;ve also read how Xiaomi phones don&#39;t have the LTE bands needed so they are not made for use in the U.S. Can the Mi Mix be used anywhere in the U.S.? Will the phone calls be of good quality and not drop? I&#39;m considering buying but it&#39;s these questions that are holding me back. Thanks.
Surprisingly you had no reviews on mi A1. Please make one it
how this phone is doing in 2017 because looking forward to buy one?
Bezel-less?  LMAO erm.. just NO.
Wake me up when the phone can also be a solar powered phone.... Bezel less are fucking useless.
How much is the price?
Can you give me your Xiaomi Mi mix?
I want that starry sky lockscreen wallpaper....
Hey jackoff what do you think that black thing around the screen is?  Its a f**king bezel.  Clickbaiting people for views and subs?  You have a great channel and put out some damn good videos but you look like a moron when you lie and put bezel-less in your title for a phone that clearly has a bezel.
Xiomi phones just shitttt
Nice video mkbhd
let&#39;s not forget that it has a headphone jack
all starts here first bezel less phone!!!!
The screen to body ratio is actually 83.6% , still amazing tho
You know that&#39;s a more immersive experience? Real life. Get off your devices.
Bullshit how much ever xiaomi makes I will hate it.  This phone is piece of crap
Raaazer phooone fan boy here
The beginning of bezeless phones
I would like to know about the mi mix 2 and if I can use it in the states
I&#39;m watching this on an iPhone 3G 
Is this available in the Philippines?
Your best ever Intro👍
Am I the only one who this it’s ugly?
Samsung galaxy note fe
Solid review my nigga
Anyone got any links were to buy this in the US ?
Hey Xiaomi! Send me this, I&#39;ll make so many good videos on this  I&#39;ll be as popular as Marquess here. Lol.
Anybody using this on Cricket $60 Unlimited plan and using hotspot with no issues (without paying the $10 for the 8gb hotspot for the plan)
I have MI MIX,it broke easily by just dropping by accident ;(
You mention break-ability because of the additional display space. All phones have glass edge to edge more or less. They all kinda have the same durability when it comes to that.
fan of xiaomi
AMEYXING💖👌😢
I just got this phone yesterday, biggest mistake in my life ! Worst camera ever !!
Xiaomi user 😋👍
Is it available in the states ? With what companies is it compatible with ?
哪个大神有这张iphone的壁纸啊，谢谢了🙏！
i need this iphone wallpaer please help me thanks！！！
Saw this phone from one of out IT guys at work. Asked what phone is it becuaei got curious of how good-looking and how big the screen is. Wow!
why is this better than iPhone x and came out a year ago lol
AWESOME PHONE.
yo mkbhd you missed sharp aquos s2 and it looks exactly like the essential phonw
That shit isn&#39;t bezel-less at all. What the fuck are you smoking?
Did anyone else notice the date on the phone is after the date of the video published... Illuminati confirmed 😂
Where to u buy this?
<b>looks at phone</b><br>Me: &quot; im sorry samsung&quot;
IMO this one looks better than the new Mi Mix 2
whose here after watching sequel 2
Hey mkbhd mi mix 2 has launched.<br>Waiting for your video.
Still has a bigger chin than Leafy
256 GB of storage WHAT?! THAT&#39;S MORE THAN SOME COMPUTERS OF THE SAME PRICE! HOW?!
Wow... great phone. It has it all. We really need to start a revolt against Samsung, apple, LG.. etc. Look, they&#39;re gonna keep selling $800-1000  phones every year if we keep buying them. And to the companies making these flagship killers.. quit with the India, Chinese, UK market only crap,  Include a CDMA radio option and you will change the game. You wouldn&#39;t have to open a store. Sell it straight to the U.S. online. I&#39;d buy it.
Now the next version of this amazing looking phone must be the Xiaomi Mi MIX Edge.<br>That would be the phone of the century.
No front camera 😭😭😭😭😭😭
wrong, ts not interesx or uninteresx, not likex to sx thatx, say anyx, ts not boring or unboring, no such thing as funfx
Any news on the mimix 2?
Miui sucks, I hope xiaomi can get rid of it.. or customers
I love this MIX,,but have no money to buy it,shit!
What are bezels
Where can I buy this
Nice phone but i personaly dont like bezzeless phones
Xiaomi.. bringing a new era of smartphone
When he said 6.4 inch it remind me of the Sony ultra 6.4 inch but not bezel less but still big ass phone
It&#39;s a <b>M A T T E R   O F   L A W</b> that they have a headphone jack.
Waiting for mi mix 2....really really love that
Glad they didnt have the courage to remove the headphone jack...
Price??
I love it. Have note 3 and galaxy s5 and on both my star wars game lags. On this no loag at all. This phone feels so fast. Worried not to scratch it cause its not gorilla glass.
aah,love that classy intro song
Front camera placement is a major no. Needs to be at the top and centred
Will this phone work here in the U.S
Any word on the Mi Mix 2 concept?
Where is the best place to buy this phone in the US?
Your hands are dirty
Does this phone come with a 4G LTE support on ATT? I couldnt find anything about it
Proudly design and made in China
I miss this intro
How can something look like the future if it&#39;s already made?
That is a dope looking phone
Twitter squad who&#39;s watching this today 16.08.17 cos of Marques Big up!
qualiity videos in 3..2..1..
can you do an actual review of it?
totally getting this my next pay check
I think I&#39;m inlove again
As a proud owner of this phone, I love it and in years when I am forced to replace it, I hope that there is a 5th or 6th generation of it. It is absolutely beautiful, works in the US with no problem (at least for me on Verizon) and it has an absolutely stupendous battery that allows me to be using Bluetooth headphones all day at work, screen on for a lot, and still be leaving after 9 hours with 40 to 50 percent battery. The display is gorgeous and, although it is admittedly only a 17x9 1080p screen, the size of the screen allows you to comfortably enjoy media from far away from your face, unlike most phones I&#39;ve seen today. It&#39;s a masterpiece of phone design with almost no compromises.
That phone is sexxxxyyyyy
Prachtig.
the mobile is awesome <b>but</b> if dropped don&#39;t pick it up again just leave it there
Wallpapers?????
overpriced
its just a concept phone, even it is still for sale, but still have a lot of disadvantage. But it still a great phone
Would this work in the UK?
Leave it to Xiaomi to bring a fresh new look to smartphones AND bring out specs that are good for the money
wow I love it 🤗😍😊💞💕❤️💗💖💞💞💞💞💕❤️😊💕😊💕❤️💕❤️💗😃😊❤️💗💗💕💞😃😊😃😊💞😘😊😘😍💕😃😍
Dem specs 😲😲
I&#39;m getting this phone!
The future has arrived
Phone&#39;s company from..<br><br>West : Boring, Stable, and <b>cough</b> Removing features<br>East : Innovative, Unstable, but adding anti mainstream features
Xiaomi  waiting this models mini mix  5 inch screens
where is front camera?
Bring on the fucking sequel yo!
There is a cheaper model than this: doogee mix
@Paul Lukwago goooood luck
Still a shit Android.... Android are like Swiss army knives... Filled with shit, tools, bulky and ugly.... iPhones are like finely engineered pocket knives.... Fuck your Android... Ugly ass phones worth pennies and look like them too
When are US phone companies gonna start innovating.
You can get curved corners with an app. Its what I have on my One Plus 2.
love it, wanna have one, here in Kampala Uganda
Do some Xiaomi phone
Something I&#39;ve noticed is that all these Chinese phones have lots of RAM and battery.
Xiomi ???... What happen to Apple?
Cool phone but I wish it had a smaller screen
i need this phone
It&#39;s quite easy get it in China
what do u think about Xiaomi MI 5
I personally hate big display phones, heck i have a 5.2&quot; G5+ and don&#39;t even like it that much but this Mi Mix really knows how to attract my eyes. Such a beauty. <b>-</b><br>My only complaint would be battery is smaller than I&#39;d want. I hope the Mi Mix 2 will come with 5000mah. Then I&#39;m sold! ^_^
不错，最近官方搞优惠活动，3100RMB左右入手
😦 I want this phoooone.. 💟 Xiaomi
Damn. Such impressive specs and it&#39;s cheaper than an iphone
Haha it&#39;s funny to watch this in 2017
did you know that the ring around the camera and the fingerprint sensor is made out of 18K Gold!!
DAT BEZEL THO
&quot;Company you never heard of&quot;
I know I&#39;m definitely late to the party. But I ended up buying one of these. It&#39;s such a BEAUTIFUL phone. The camera isn&#39;t amazing, but it takes good photos in good lighting. This phone is innovation! The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is rumored to be dropping soon... And if that phone comes out with a snapdragon 835, 6gb ram, 2k display, updated camera and software.... It will be the best phone on the market.. Period. I&#39;m using this phone over my Samsung Galaxy S8 right now. They are two different worlds of phones.. But having innovation over typical phones people have these days is better to me in my own opinion. I&#39;ve already had comments on this phone and they are just blown away.. It kind of sucks the U. S only sees Apple and Samsung because that&#39;s all that&#39;s really hardcore promoted around here. China needs to bring more phones over to the U.S. If any of you have questions about this phone, just let me know.. I&#39;m a daily user of it and I am more than willing to answer some questions for you!
this is where it all started.
why cant apple get on their level!!
amazing ! a 16:9 smaller version would be very cool
Does anyone know how this phone performs (or if it&#39;s even compatible with) streaming straight to tv using hdmi?
mine is lock i forgot the password do u know how can i reset it .??
WHERE CAN I BUY THIS PHONE 😥😥
Just buy the dogee mix<br>It looks like the mi mix but cheaper $200 and has an amoled screen<br>Check out mrwhosetheboss&#39;s review

The phone that started it all...
xeaomee
hhghggg
Watching this in 2017 with my new MI Mix
remote take in mi mix
Is there any nice website to by this phone from in Europe?
one thing I love from this phone is its battery. in normal usage, I can get 8+ hours of SOT. in light usage, 10 hours can be achieved.
this phone isn&#39;t too big bc it&#39;s around the same size as an iphone.
i&#39;m getting this phone.
just bought this piece of art yesterday..waiting it to reach me soon :)

Why did I just get a notification for this again? <br>Saw this the exact same day he released the video. what, is Youtube doing throwbacks or something?<br>Got so excited thinking it was a Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 -_-
is there any info on a successor to the mi mix?
where can I buy this phone at? I have been looking everywhere
why did i get this notification again yesterday :/
Great looking phone. I bet that once you drop it on the ground with the screen facing down. That phone screen will crack!
I actually really like this phone😳
next year, I&#39;m upgrading from my OnePlus 3, and hoping to go to this
I wish I could afford one. :(
Please do a video on the doogee mix plz I realy want a good youtuber to review it

My dream phone
I also love
this video has gotten over 6m views....MKBHD you need to try chinese tech a lil more often.........and hey they have the population and internet
…or the Dell Venue 8 7000
Watch Samsung do this in 2 years lol
Xiaomi really missed an opportunity here. They should have added better software, renamed the company to something more western (like just simply &quot;X&quot;) and put an fancy X on the back of the phone rather than &quot;Mix designed my Mi&quot; (which is really stupid), then sold it in the US and other places than just China for $1000+ based on storage size like Apple does to maximize profits and people would still buy it! They would have made so much money. Instead they sold it only in China for a low price (which is bad for them) with really good specs, 16MP, 6GB RAM, 256 GB storage, and barely made any profit. They should have also named the phone something else. &quot;Xiaomi Mi Mix&quot; is the worst name for a phone ever. Just name the company X, then name the phone something fancy, have fancy advertising, and there you go. It could have been the most sold smartphone in 2016, but they completely missed out. People are buying the phone in China and selling it to people in the US for profits. So stupid. Nintendo makes the same mistakes by having low supply and high demand.
too fat
You now what is up <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The sky. Now this what my s voice app said
hey marques....can you do a review of xiaomi mi 6
Thanks to you MKBHD and this clip from few months before I am a happy owner of the ^GB MI MIX :)<br>Back in 2016 I was dissapointed with not getting the N7 and was looking for a replacement.. I saw this piece of art held in your hands and went for the pre order. I didnt go wrong. Ther is only 2 things which I am missing on this phone:<br>1. Spen<br>2. Samsung camera<br><br>Dont take me wrong the camera is up to date but comparing to a Sammy camera especialy at night there there is a difference..<br><br>All in all I am super happy with this phone and till today there is no better phone for my needs:)<br><br>Thanks again Marques!
Can you use this on sprint network?
Amazing phone
what are those plants on ur desk
I would!
Heck yeah I would rock this phone :)
instead of only a chin on the phones, just have the same thing but with a forehead instead of the chin
6 months later, and LG and samsung copied it
Where&#39;s the front facing camera
This is definitely a good phone, i can connect it to my car Aux-in. But it can&#39;t run iOS.
But still no micro SD card slot.. <br>They should of used one of the Sim card slot
i saw this at online store thinking its just another china phone. then seeing the screen and the spec. wow. amazing. id buy this
Sharp Aquos Crystal, anyone?
Best phone ever
Meanwhile Samshit fanboys and iSheep are still debating about their overpriced phones
Would you mind reviewing Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X? @MKBHD
It&#39;s $1000 in Canada.... RIP me XD
why you didn&#39;t review it?
s8 vs LG g6 vs mi mix .
That, friends, is what inspired the G6 and S8 designs
Does it create the earpiece sound by using vibration, similar to the Sony Bravia A1 OLED TV ? and can u do a full review after several months of usage please? *or maybe a comparison with Xperia XZ Premium, LG G6, Pixel XL, by including a blind comparison of the camera too ?
me mix or meme ix
o and first rounded screen ha Samsung and lg copied this phone
The way you combine colors, amazes me. For example, green wallpaper on Mi MIX, green plant and white desk to keep a clean and well color-balanced shot. The shots on your videos are pure gold! That&#39;s why you are one of the best tech YouTubers. Keep it up.
I got one by 600$<br>I love it unless the camera sensor.
I&#39;m proud
that front camera placement LMAO. fuck this shitty design
这个手机的屏幕就是SHARP提供的方案
front camera?
Bezel-less phone with bezels! WOW INNOVATION
Dope phone! Dope Marques! Great specs on this one and I love the price. Do you like the camera on this one? As always, you Rock!
Last time i checked it was 700$ not 500$
where can I buy one of these
Hey MKBHD.. If possible, please do display comparison of this phone vs S8 plus. Which looks good in person? Which is more usable and functional in day to day use? <br><br>From other YouTube videos, I&#39;m surprised to see that Mi Mix beats s8 plus on some speed test categories whereas no other sd821 phones including pixel couldn&#39;t do that (in said categories). I&#39;m willing to take the risk of importing this from China over buying s8 plus. Even price is going for it over s8.
Wish I seen this before getting my Samsung :/
it&#39;s a bigger and better version of the OnePlus 3T for only $70 more
kinda reminding me of the sharp aquos crystal
<b>Disgustingly</b> beautiful.
Thank you marques. Without people like you pushing the industry to show what the consumers really want, we wouldn&#39;t be getting any progress in smartphones at all. Maybe this video is what pushed Samsung and LG to adopt their new designs? Regardless, thank you for what you do, especially for praising innovation with every video.
MIUI is really nice.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=231">3:51</a> look at the time
man how are your videos always so great? u sure do  put alot of effort into reviewing..... anyway I totally agree with u with the futuristic feel of this phone, but i&#39;d be scared to use one
well covered MKBHD, I think your videos are very well done and entertaining. Keep up the good work.
now.....after one year, Samsung s8
Great video! I love your review style.
I love the video and your personality, makes it what it is, KEEP DOING WHAT YOUR doing!
great look, hope to see other companies go for this  concept, or at least develop their displays in this manner.
Thanks man!Your videos are always to the point.
yes bro please keep reviewing some great chinese phones because not all chinese phones are bad! gotta love your crispy high quality video! :D
What a cinematography it was just awesome too good.
Awesome phone, great review! I also like the quality of your videos.
I really enjoy ur video&#39;s ur going into details and ur video&#39;s are high quality thank you for the effort you put in youe video&#39;s. love it!
mkbhd: love the video! you edit amazing!<br>the s8 and g6 are all because of this phone.
Great video bro. That phone looks awesome. I gotta say the way you talk about the phones makes me want to consult you before a smartphone purchase. You really know your stuff. I love your videos. It&#39;s not boring but very interesting and fun to watch
Loved The Video,The Mix
this is more powerful than my everyday laptop. shut up and take my money
Cool!!! Such a great review. Pretty much everything what you need know about this phone.
nice video marq, love the vibrant color
The phone looks amazing.. I hope bezel-less phones are the future. Great video by the way! Love your channel.. Factual and straight forward

I love those epic shots taken of the phone. nice work man!
The best design ever!!
This phone is very sexy , keep the good work !
awesome video man....keep up the awesome work....and by the way I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on this phone !
can the piezo electric crystal be hacked to resonate at glass&#39;s frequency? would be a cool experiment.
the cover totally defeats the purpose.
Nice review.I was waiting to see this mobile reviewed by you.Great video :D
Man I love your channel,  you always trim the fat and give us the good stuff - one stop shop for reliable information in tasty 4K. Awesome work.
my god take a look on that video! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamcrispy">#TeamCrispy</a>. It&#39;s so clean/simple and minimalistic.
love the phone. cant wait to have one. futuristic af
I don&#39;t how MKBHD but every single video of yours just screams quality and you get me excited for tech gadgets that I will probably never have. Like seriously that bezel-less phone would be a dream of mine. Keep up the amazing work man.
Excellent quality video production as always, love the focus pulling.
you are one of the people that i can&#39;t wait to watch and you are very good at talking to your viewers and you job with your reviews
MKBHD call this innovation, Besel-less with headphone Jack, Love your Way of describing the Technology
Great video KPHD....always spot on with your videos without any buzz....keep up the great job....
That was really a competitive smartphone for this time being,<br>and thanks for the info.<br>nice content keep up with your good deeds! (thumbs up)
man mr mobile ur great  i like the graphics and the perfection you put into your videos
As a heavy android user i love this phone for it performance 6gb of ram 256gb for storage snapdargon 821 processor 4400mAh battery excellent phone for a tech user like me excellent video thank you.
Infinitely huge universe, millions of matters of various sizes moving randomly with unpredictable position and velocity just makes me realize how lucky I am to be a part of rare life in this universe on this earth in the time when innovation has no bezels. Proud to be a Part of it...
Like always high quality videos at beast resolution. I like how you review phones combining them with other gadgets around them, nice takes. Keep up bro.😎👍
You got your new studio looking nice.
The Mix is almost as cool as your channel!!
Brave attempt by both the companies (Piezoelectric speaker something new to hear). Background music and in between video edit of car is classy
I would love to see your unboxing and impression of the Honor Note 8.  This looks like another amazing phone, but have not seen enough details about the everyday use.
Nice job bro , this is 1 of the best rewiews i ever seen . Good luck  . Thanks for the videos !!!
A true milestone in smartphone history! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mimix">#MiMix</a>
Great review! I love this phone and wish it got more attention.
this phone is the future and also your camera is killer<br>loved it💗💗💗
I love how your videos looks: smooth, sharp and cool :D
Please stop considering the iPhone 7 Plus as overpriced shit... just because doesn&#39;t have QHD ( which is using more battery ) and no headphone jack.... if you wanna say that about U Ultra go ahead.. that phone sucks
hellow , <br>I heard about some problems with the earpiece .<br>does it really creats problem in noisy environment or it spreads sound like speaker in silent environment<br>will u plz tell me bout this issue?
until the galaxy s8
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=112">1:52</a> wallpaper??
that blue wallpaper ?
It looks like crap. The design is lifeless and no one cares about this phone.
This site says it&#39;s for 599.99 dollars with coupon code: MIMIXG<br><a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_617026.html?wid=4&amp;lkid=10621110">http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_617026.html?wid=4&amp;lkid=10621110</a><br>pretty cool
My new phone will be this, bye iPhone welcome Android
in the US does this phone get software updates? Do they run on 4G LTE? i have tmobile
These videos are beautifully made.
Please do a Mi Mix vs S8 or S8+
take notes HTC. All metal bezel less amoled
better than s8 and G6 guys
Wait for mi mix 2..
please review xiaomi mi6 whenever you get it... youll again miss it like the mi5 otherwise...
Xiaomi is stupid to sell these phones for 500 dollars, most people love to show off their expensive phones no matter how bad the phones really are. if Mercedes lowers their price to match Ford and maintain the same quality. Mercedes will bankcrupt within a year
So I think this phone beats the S8 to be honest I mean it has better specs AND I think the screen on this phone is much better looking then that of the S8&#39;s screen. So is this baby ever coming states side because even though I&#39;m not a huge phone guy I&#39;d go outta my way to get this phone I mean holy shit I never knew I wanted a Bezzel-less phone until now.
Sharp made this in 2014! (Sharp Aquos Crystal)
Idk about this, I think I&#39;m getting a phobia from bezel-less phones :-(
how do you buy this?i`m in china can not buy it !!!
You see that samsung fanboys?!<br><br>Not the s8 was the first bezelless smartphone!
company never heard? ...What are you talking about; change please the style of your channel a dedicate to jokes.. god my lord
is it still worth it to buy it now?
No way this comes out in the US, Apple and Samsung will block it.
im happy to see its on sale here in uae and im gonna get one... ill pass iphone 7 for now
Can you please 🙏 send a link of the wallpaper of the guy climbing a fence i like that pic
is it just the vid or does it keep lagging...
Samshit fanboys where u at?
Why didn&#39;t they push the screen all the way to the bottom and have the camera at the top with the bezel
Lot of money to pay for a phone that most western people have never heard of .You will loose a lot of money and thats even if you can find someone that would buy it off you
You still can find 258Gb version here: <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Original-Xiaomi-Mi-MIX-Pro-Mobile-Phone-Snapdragon-821-6GB-RAM-256GB-ROM-6-4-2040x1080P/2815066_32791573194.html?spm=2114.12010612.0.0.QFl1ol">https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Original-Xiaomi-Mi-MIX-Pro-Mobile-Phone-Snapdragon-821-6GB-RAM-256GB-ROM-6-4-2040x1080P/2815066_32791573194.html?spm=2114.12010612.0.0.QFl1ol</a>
I would definitely rock one of these
LG and Samsung acting like they&#39;re so badass with their bezels obvs shit their pants when this came out
if it did had a edge display than this was the best smartphone of 2k16.
Woah he pronounced Xiaomi correctly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23respect">#respect</a>
shaomi? isn&#39;t it siaomi? just sounds so wrong...
I have Xiaomi Redmi Note 1, the first Note ... for 200 dollars. It has been 2 years and 2017 is the third ..Still working Great no Flaws or Repairs whatsoever. I use it to watch videos and Listen to music Plus Application Debugging.
Will it work on Verizon Wireless 4G LTE? Am on the east coast, Maryland @marques Brownlee
and it cost 500$ for 6gb of ram and 256gb of storage but 1080p screen and 12mp back camera no front camera because its got eaten by the screeb
Yeah Baby! Who has this in the US?Canada/LATAM? :Looks goode except for some issues..
This xiaomi mi mix gives me continuous orgasm just looking at it. No gonna lie.
Anybody successfully using this in the US?
that is a gorgeous phone,wow!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=90">1:30</a>. There&#39;s also an option to drag the screen down by swiping the home button to the right.. Called one handed mode.
Shame- it is so ugly, though?
I LOVE IT!!
Does anybody own this phone already for some time? How does it work? How&#39;s the software? Not sure, if I want this or the S8..
Text speed please
:&#39;v y yo me compré el iPhone 7
这是世界上最好看的手机，无论黑色白色 ，如果在日常使用中谁亮出这款手机，它的回头率一定很高。
However where it came from, does it last atleast 1week?
Why bother yourself buying trashy phones like samsung and apple if you can afford this thing with lower price and top notch quality?
How are you gonna put a case on it?
wooooooow what a phone☺👍
What watch is that guy wearing?
Where the S8 comments at?
I don&#39;t know why the Samsung Galaxy S8 is getting so much attention for doing something that this Xiaomi phone already did 2 years ago.
Dude stop, my penis can only get so erect
More Video！！！
this shit is so beautiful
The Chinese companies are killing the competition especially Huawei now Xiaomi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=27">0:27</a> that&#39;s jay lenos phone
This or Samsung galaxy s8+ ???
Typing this from a Xiaomi Redmi phone which is their more budget line but even these are AMAZING value for money. I wouldn&#39;t buy an Android phone from anyone else at this point, especially not $amsung.
watching this on my mi mix, its wonderful
This or galaxy S8 ? what&#39;s your suggestion?
if that think had a edge screen it would be Instabuy for me !
i want it so bad
xioami did it 1st Samsung copied !
In India You Get 2GB Ram!  16 GB rom. 5&quot; screen. snapdragon 425. in 98$!!<br>Better Than anyyy samsung Phone within same Range..Dope 🍴
Xiaomi is next level
Samsung just copy mi mix on s8
This looks prettier than the new s8
what&#39;s Galaxy S8?. :P
Soon all phones will look the same, just as all tvs. Simply because once the bezels disappear and you only have the screen how do you differentiate?
Who has ever used a phone with one hand, like actually, no one does that
6 GB of ram God damn
which camera You use ?
Where can I get that wallpaper of person in blue climbing the yellow wall.. that is also cool.
Yea I think a Bezeless phone especially with the dimensions of that one is super sexy I&#39;d rock that phone......If it weren&#39;t $500 but that type of money for a friggen cell phone is a hell no lol.
Checks prices: 1000 euro <b>cries in central European</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=19">0:19</a> lol 404 phone not found
hell&#39;s yeah I want it
Try sell that thing here in the Philippines locally(including other Xiaomi flagships) and people will call it &quot;Made in China so its fake&quot; here.What a bunch of ignorants.They only know branding,they only know Samsung,Sony and Apple.
I owned one for about a month. Everything about the phone was nice except the camera. The camera was abysmal, unfortunately, enough so to make me sell it and get a new phone.
why can&#39;t every phone look like this ssshmm
My Xperia Z Ultra was 6.4 inch tho, but bigger than this a lot.. Srsly 😂😂
hows the camera mate??
Give me that review phone😂
Looks like an absolute muscular phone, power packed specs, looks too good , bezel-less will be the NEW norm starting 2017
This thing is legit more powerful than my pc.<br>I&#39;d say the phone is worth every penny, good job China.
damn pretty good pricing imo
yeah
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=230">3:50</a>   420 blazed
Mkbhd pls give the download link of starry sky wallpaper with a man hanging with balloon which you used in the mi mix
I have been using this phone since 3 months now and I will say there Is cons and pros for this device<br><br>pros<br>unique eye catching design but without case (check the cons)<br>quick charging but now almost every phone have that so I will not say this is a pro<br> <br><br>cons<br>you cannot use the phone without case very very slippery more then Samsung latest flagship  and even you decide to use it without case 1 meter drop and the screen will crack<br>no water or dust resistant <br>the camera is from 2012 year useless<br>the screen is full hd not quad <br>even with 6 gb ram the phone will hang if you playing a game and someone calls in middle <br>there is no software update at all since 3 months <br>it is heavy <br>the screen will get scratches easily in pocket if you carry keychain wallet also in same pocket (I didn&#39;t find any screen protector yet)<br>the front facing camera is at bottom and when you use it in normal world the other person see that you are looking over the phone on something else then him<br><br><br>there is many more but for now this is more then enough to back off <br><br>most. important <br><br>resell value
666666
where is earpiece?
fuck apple
RELEASE THE XIAOMI MI MIX NOW!
Do you still owe this Device? If yes, can you please do an update?
I think taking selfie with this mix is little difficult because it&#39;s camera is down
love this phone...when everything else looks basically similar...this stands apart. I want one!
this is inovation not remove headphone jack
OMG I JUST REALISED! Where&#39;s the front camera?
I would rather love a 6.0 inch screen with tiny top and bottom for many reasons:<br>a. for all the &quot;stuff&quot; that needs to be there<br>b. to have symmetrical looks<br>c. to be able to hold from both ends and not having to touch the screen itself while gaming
XIAOMI MI MIX vs ONEPLUS 3T
Where to buy it from??
尖叫吧，什么叫创新 来自中国的公司
i want this phone but it&#39;s got a low ppi for it&#39;s size... compared to other phones.
Yea I would love to see this on Verizon in the US. I hear there is a Mix 2 coming this year.
is this available worldwide?..how much in US dollar?😊
Oh &amp; it&#39;s not $500, the 128GB version is like $700 &amp; the 256GB version is about $900 to $1k X[
the ONLY thing I dislike about this phone is that it&#39;s not water resistant &amp; I kinda need that cause i&#39;m a clumsy unlucky person who will surely drop it either in the toilet or the sink...
marques can u give me mi mix mobile please plss plss
i want the band you&#39;r wearing in your hand !!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=58">0:58</a> guess who else has a small chin... starts with L and ends with eafy
where has this phone been all my life?!?!😭😭 where can I buy this in the U.S.?
how can I purchase this phone in America?
you can get it here by the best price <a href="http://got.by/uaxmc">http://got.by/uaxmc</a>
apple sucks!
apple is being shiba for many years.
it&#39;s possible to make a phone with no bezels and no buttons and completely wireless no ports now so why doesn&#39;t it exist
This phone would have destroyed everything if it had a better camera. They should have discarded the gold trim for a top end Camera.
is it currently available in the u.s. ??
this phone and Nokia will destroy 2017. don&#39;t mess with Chinese they got technology like crazy lol we in 2017 Chinese are in 2030🤔😑😂👌
bro for get everything i mostly watch show box on my phone that size screen would do me well I would swap my Samsung for that phone lol all android is the same anyway. I could easily download a an app that make the phone look like samsung layout. I downloaded  iPhone layout  on my android lol people thought it was an iPhone 😂but yeah I would buy this phone 👌
The reason to buy one of these phones is to have a phone and save money from the rip-off companies in the USA. Well, that&#39;s over - they are now charging USA prices. Why bother?
which kind of glass it has?? is it easily breakable
Why don&#39;t they just put the bezel/ Earpiece array where it&#39;s normally place, and just remove the bottom bezel?
If they would drop the stupid front facing selfie cam thus no need to for the chin I&#39;m all in!
DOPE!
my friend in year 8 has this
If the LTE bands work here in the US I would most definitely rock this phone.
I would buy this in a heartbeat. <b>Goes over to aliexpress</b>
小米
plz. everyone just once hold this phone on your hands ,u will probably never think about iPhone
1.47 minute Wallpaper?
I am so getting one
What is the name of your wrist band? Pls reply
SSSSSSSICK.
I don&#39;t like it
Please do not buy phones from this company camera is dark during video calling
Xiaomi doesn&#39;t have repair services in the USA. Don&#39;t waste money .
what is the smart band you are wearing? it looks really very nice
Most apps won&#39;t take advantage of that hardware.
It&#39;s actually $800 in the States so calm down lol
Nah, looks uncomfortable to hold. Galaxy Edge phone bezels superior IMO, those tiny side bezels ruin the whole concept unlike Sammy who wrap the display around..
Does anyone else just give a thumbs up for the intro song alone???
sharp looks better
www.mibtc.store is giving this phone away. contest ends feb. 28th
I have a xioami 4 pro prime 4000mah expandle memory all for £164 unbelievable!
He said piezo wrong
Still see the bezels. Curve the glass around like samsung&#39;s edge, except on all 3 sides.
this wallpaper is fantastic. where can we get this?
I need a bezelless replacement for my Sharp Aquos,  but the software on the Mi Mix is absolute garbage.
This phone needs to be part of my body
If only it was smaller
I want phn like this but not available in india😑
$839.00 in Canada for the regular one.
that is an insanely nice phone, would definitely use it as a daily phone.
But it&#39;s really hard to get one even in China. Sad😭
Mmm... I want CM or AOSP on this though...
So it&#39;s actually 1000$ everywhere.
display must be tougher.....
The Future is here,mi mix
why this phone got so much attention???  you can check Nubia Z11
is there a 5&#39;&#39; version?
Hey have you done a review of the Mate 9 from Huawei/  that would be dope :)

And who cares about all shit about the New &quot;Vivo or lava&quot; Hey It&#39;s official From google Vivo or lava could suck My ass ! At That Price ( 7 Million Rupiahs or between 600$ ) I&#39;ll go for Pixel because Performance brah ! and yes what do I Play ? PSX And PSP Games and.... some social media games
Does it come in iOS
The problem is always the same: Powered by Android.
BEST SMARTPHONE HERE <a href="http://ali.pub/uzio7">http://ali.pub/uzio7</a>
I wish the phone had an ip rating, and it would automatically get accepted anywhere
What is on this guys wrist?
good china
Samsung needs employees like the one in Xiaomi, lol this phone company is making other big names look like complete jokes
I want this so bad...
Where&#39;s the best place to pick one of these up ?
dat intro music
so sick
idea was stolen from Sharp  They also made a S7 copy. Even though, goodlooking phone but useless in the netherlands due to different 4G LTE  bands.
Id definitely buy this phone
Best price on the aliexpress <a href="http://got.by/dp8e2">http://got.by/dp8e2</a>
Dang this beauty should be available for the US and Canadian market now.  Dang
Are you willing to sell this
gahh damn xiaomi makes me want android
But you are lying about the price, don&#39;t do that, what&#39;s the actual price because it&#39;s not $500
Does this work with T-mobile?
Does anyone know where I can get the wallpaper he has on the lockscreen;-;
WOW, so nice phone how much price?<br>I want to buy it.
i have xiaumi and xiaumi is veri good phone
They should make a 5.2 inch one, that would be amazing, this phone is just too big
Love intro music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=231">3:51</a> lol 420
I wish I had the money to get this...
Where can i get that journal at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=212">3:32</a>
I just want a full screen phone now this is so close to it.
Xiaomi, OnePlus, DJI, Huawei, and good old Lenovo. Man Chinese tech companies are catching up!
Yes, Yes I would rock this phone as a Daily ..... For sure.. Waiting
faste charge is not....picher
iPhone still better !!
it was definitely the future
This phone makes others bulimic
wallpaper at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=115">1:55</a>?
must have phone
Bezelless phones are ugly, cartoonish, flatscreen TV looking and the bezelless designs makes it flimsy and design wise they easily break because the screen doesnt offer much protection from side impacts. Thats why apple isnt riding this bezelless fad the chinese are so obsessed about
WOWOWOWOWOOWOWOWOWOWOWOOWOWOW
does it come in a smaller size?;
Guys, who are asked to find on Aliexpress mi mix? Here I found who need to take <a href="http://ali.pub/89amh">http://ali.pub/89amh</a>
beautiful shape
lol if you have this phone you need to buy a case that has a wide border edge to make up for the handles,just so you can really hold it...the screen is impressive main highlighg almost bezeless,very nice...and i bet performance is great too,average great...
nice👍
This is AMAZING! Other companies needs to step up! Smartphones all look the same now but this? This is innovation!
Got the 6GB Version and loving it. :)
this looks amazing
Why do you people hate bezels I love bezels
OMG what an ugly phone
i love it so much!
Idk. ..great with the high screen to body ratio but plastic makes any phone look cheap imo. Looks  kinda thick too.
<a href="http://ali.pub/uzio7">http://ali.pub/uzio7</a>
Where did u get dis?
i want that machine so badly!
500$ ? it&#39;s 1000$ in my country.
I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it, but theres something that just feels a little.. off to me. Looks like a nice enough phone, and maybe its just because its different, but I&#39;m almost uncomfortable when looking at it haha. Still on the no bezel train though.
In the future, you&#39;ll have a bunch of light sensing pixels built into the screen, and they will combine to make one picture as the front facing camera. So you probably won&#39;t need a designated camera spot, it will just be spread throughout the screen.
Wallpaper @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=113">1:53</a>! Where is that found?
Xiaomi is the best phone manufacturer
What is the title of the song that played shortly at the start of the review, I&#39;ve liked it?
screen is 6.44 inch but since its bezel less it looks smaller in size but not the screen. cool looking phone
the price is crazy
does anyone know if this phone or of any international phone that will work on Sprints 4g network in the U.S.?
that thing is gorgeous. the Chinese mobile market is growing so quickly
no way its selling for $500...
great
Hey marquees, do you know where can i download a global rom for this mi mix? I got the 256gb version. All great so far
Buy Mi MIX @<a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_364275.html?vip=221977">http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_364275.html?vip=221977</a>
Welcome to 2k16 guys 😜
imagine if this had edge screens like s7 edge
Does it have a headphone jack
mi india fake searvieces plz dont shop mi  contact 8733884267
FrequencyCheck is showing that this phone won&#39;t be compatible with LTE on AT&amp;T.  Any other opinions?
I fell in love when you said 6.4 inch display! I want,now!
quite the technology though 😎
Ordering one in a month.  I need this one. lol. Loved the redmi note 2 and my daughter has it now still running crazy good.
The comments created by paid ppl is just mind boggling.
It looks cool, but if you see drop tests here on youtube, it shatters at the second drop. Useless.
Nice
just like leafy
Mindfuck @40secs
just wondering if anyone knows if this will work on LTE for TMobile in the US
How do you talk on the phone with this with no speaker?  Is there a speaker on the top or something?
Don&#39;t let the beautiful hardware fool you, the software is a pain in the ass!
That is so damn sexy!
I can&#39;t wait until the chin is GONE.<br><br>Bezel less is the future.
Can buy in China, go to XIAOMI official website to buy
I wish they sold it in US
Glad to see you are making so many video on Chinese products, change what people think about MIC.
For the same specs, memory and battery life  Apple would charge you some $2,300 according to Gizmodo.
Chinese smartphone companies are the best!
want this phone soo bad
what&#39;s the model of other phone
But how is the battery life?
at least the price is reasonable compared to others branded phone such as i-phone samsung etc
hey you dint show the front camera, and the headphone jack.....also show the top portion of it...
How much is this going for? In USD and AUD?
I&#39;m in loveee
superb....😎😎😎
can i have that .. can u plz grant it to me i really need it right now I&#39;m from philippines
Best ever.

spiegelt sehr, das Display
Looks pretty cumbersome and shitty to me!
I was gonna get that phone but I noticed that the battery is non removable.
Hey would it work in India?
WOW I Love Your VIDs
Look grate
Damn! 😍🔥👌 I&#39;d definitely use it; with a launcher though😂😂
intro song id ?
$500? Where? Everywhere I look it&#39;s pushing $1000
Thank god there are no harambe jokes.
Hi, is the Mi Mix Qi capable? (Wireless charging)
Just got mi Mi Mix yesterday and man its beautiful. After one night, it performs beautifully so far...I paid waaaaay too much for it but it was a X-Mas gift to myself...
is it waterproof ? if so I&#39;m buying this .
sick phone
it&#39;s another chinese copycat from iphone 9 plus. I am sure of it. btw, dji drones are the chinese copycats of a Taiwanese company called Human Zoo in Taiwan .haha
sooner or later, Apple will claim this design is a copycat from Apple&#39;s design
Can somebody tell me the car in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=102">1:42</a>?
i would so rock this for sure
will this carry all the radios to work on SE AT&amp;T Cricket or T-Mobile? in the USA
what protection does it use  ?
Earpiece ?
curto bue
Can I buy it from China online and use it here?
how is apple even still a thing?? 😂😂
how did you install the google play store in the mi mix
How can i get this in America?
hell yeah I would
I think a phone would look a lot better if it had a very small bezel at the top and bottom the size of a front camera lens rather than it being fully bezel-less. Also the aspect ratio of the screen needs to be wider but that&#39;s a detail I guess.
Plz Marques How did you get the google play store on yours? I just got my hands on a mi mix but can&#39;t seem to download the app or even update the phone software.
Had mine for a few days its awsome.. Just gotta be a lil tech savy it comes all Chinesed out.. Lets say its very different..
Om Telolet om
If only it was 16:9 😬

Love the display 😍👌🏻💯
If they curved the screen around the camera that would be dope
can i have the lock screen wallpaper on your phone?
don&#39;t worry Nokia in 2017 will blow all of those phones out of the water
dude that thing is a beast for the price. and it comes with a case. pff apple aint got nothin
good hardware but software is terrible
I love Xiaomi. My Mi5 is an incredible phone for the price. Up there with the Samsung S7.
imagine Apple will look like this but with 100% screen screen to body ratio. so sick!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=232">3:52</a> <br><br>... 420 BLZ IT FIGGITS
dream phone!
love your videos :).. keep making them :P
and I&#39;m imagining the same phone with a curved display right now...<br>A curved screened bezzeless phone...<br>:P
xiaomi is better than retarded samsung
Sickkkkkk
in this days...smartphones born like a human...every year they release hot/top smartphones...maybe someday human and phones are the same population...👍✌
November 4th was my b day &gt;,&lt;
My smartphone dream for 2017<br>Ceramic and metal (steel design not aluminum crap like lgv10 had steel rails)<br>Water resistant<br>USB C<br>Snapdragon 835 and Adreno graphics and vulkan<br>Qualcomm quick charge and wireless<br>Bezelless design with 1440p resolution<br>Android nougat or 8.0 when it comes out<br>Dual camera (16 mp f1.7 monochrome and RGB sensors or wide angle zoom is meh)<br>6gb of ram<br>Dual sim or SD card with base storage of 128<br>Am I forgetting anything?<br><br>Oh and removable battery would be nice but it would be hard with water resistance and a ceramic body.
fun fact if you use Google now on tap and search YouTube for this phone it leads to this video
WUT! 6 gb ram! Holy shit.
Can u add me in your whatsapp grup
your fingers are tooo long thats why you can hold this easily
nice phone, i will bye it
Anyone has the iPhone wallpaper at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=74">01:14</a>? :)
Those specs are absolutely insane!
forget iPhone this is way better
Might get one just because Philippe Starck designed it
and windows 10 version?
“companies you never heard of&quot;, but they are bigger than you think. I am planning to get one when I visit China soon. it runs about $650 in the Chinese market for a 256GB version. And for case, that&#39;s the least I need to worry about lol, I already found hundreds of them.
Good God, that phone is beautiful.
Mi MIX 2 would have 99% screen to body ratio..
front camera?
This phone totally work on Verizon o.o
I love it! Must buy for my next phone. I´m a big gamer so this screen is perfect  :)  Thanx for the review Marques, keep it up (Y)
The bottom bezel may not be big but the lack of a top bezel makes it look imbalanced. I&#39;d rather have a smaller bezel on both the top and bottom
I have redmi note 3 😢pro
Truely genius from xiaomi.
Too bad it&#39;s so expensive
in fact，the quick ball can be more convenient by slipping it instead of clicking it twice
Marques where did you bouth
uuugh i want a one hand phone
i got my MI mix from shanghai last week and it cost me $1080 for the 256 GB and 6 RAM version .... the sony Z ultra i bought back in 013 is much much thinner and much lighter than this xiaomi mi mix, and the z ultra screen seems to be bigger. with the risk of coming across like a moaner,  i regret getting this phone mainly because it is heavy ... and i would get a google pixel XL or the LG v20 if i had not bought this one.   the sony z ultra is my favorite all time phone and its too bad sony will never make another one.
looks nice, yeah. but if you put it in a case it&#39;s going to look like any other phone. the specs still are amazing though.
Phone with 4400 mAH I&#39;m totally getting
Is this an non-working phone?  Can you say anything about the voice quality coming through the vibration?
Give awayyyyy?? Haha looks pretty dope
1.Huawei honor note 8
take notes apple..
i have looking at this phone for a while ,it is now Dec. ill get it straight after the new yr.  where can I purchase it plzzzxxx
you should do a giveaway of this!!!
Could we get your opinion on &quot;air by crazy baby&quot; it looks to good to be true and I trust your opinion so😝
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=30">0:30</a> meme mx
Who cares even if its made by largest smartphone maker in China. Next year around I phone 8 will come out with same technology and apple will boast they have created new technology. There will be huge lines of isheeps outside apple store. And when they come to know about mi mix they will say its copied &quot;from&quot; I phone 8
sign me up
the Phones in the future 2017
How can I get this phone in Germany
(Samsung take note) (those puns though)
Ceramic drop n its will crack.
should have shown us the front camera working
one word for you guys complaining about its in china.... <a href="http://alibaba.com">alibaba.com</a>
Is it coming to the UK? I would be buying it in a flash.
is it in only Chinese language bro?  I see often the uppwr shatter is in Chinese language please confirm rply
I still question whether or not this phone was made to be sold. It&#39;s created a TON of buzz but it&#39;s not even available in the Xiaomi store here in China.<br>Update: I actually found the MIX on the Xiaomi website today, so it was just delayed a bit.
Gotta try that phone!!
It&#39;s just too big.
How fast was the internet? Is LTE B7 2620MHz enough?
Is the front face camera at the bottom???
is this available in India?
900$ on Ebay. .this is ridiculously overpriced
That phone though! Mi want. So sad it is unavailable in the US.<br><br>KBHD, if you were to get a new Android phone, available in the US (damn you Xiaomi!), what would you get? Assume price is not the biggest deciding factor, but value is important.
will this phone play full screen video with any other apps ...pls reply. ...and im using s g e5. pls send one plus 3 t  🙏 i really need a upgrade
Such a large screen will be a battery hog. &amp; too difficult to swipe from the edges (like for the notification bar: mostly swiped). Other than that, it&#39;s great: price, new R&amp;D to replace proximity sensors &amp; an in-call speaker!
Nice mobile phone but very difficult to buy. I&#39;m in China most of the time, they only sell every Tuesday at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=600">10:00</a> am via online for  5 seconds. Pressing your mobile button to buy doesn&#39;t work due to millions of people are doing the same, I heard they will stop selling this concept phone by July 2017 once they reach the quota same as other Xiaomi model not available already. This is only for Chinese market and Xiaomi has no interest of selling this phone outside China.
amazing
india reles deta
if the body wasn&#39;t as slippery as you said it was, i wouldv&#39;e imported it from china

Wow i want it
Proud of my Chinese
due to Bezel less, does it have front camera or not!!
I hope that Xaomi reaches out to US carriers so people can easily buy their phones without having to worry about seeing text as Chinese characters. If Korean brands like HTC can make it then this can
This or Samsung galaxy s7?
It&#39;s designed and made in China.I think that I won&#39;t pay for iPhone 8 next time.<br>I used previous other model from Xiaomi.That company really pay lots of attention on design user interface, its MiUI is extremely useful, clean and beautiful.<br>And Xiaomi Company also design and sell: drones, surge protector, Smart IPCamera(you can communicate with your camera by voice), etc.<br>Apple?I&#39;m kinda disappointed honestly.
It looks ok I guess So far I&#39;m still happy with my Samsung phones.
I bought a 10000 mAh powerbank from these guys a few months a go. Very high quality and for less than 30 euro&#39;s. Charges my iPhone fully at least 4 times.
Where can I purchase this phone ASAP and from a reputable vendor?
Can i throw a Verizon sim card in and it will work or they don&#39;t have unlocked?
No microsd?
Walpapper ???
Just when people actually thought Mi Mix created new tech, but it actually only copied from Sharp Aquos Crystal <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforaquoscrystal">#Justiceforaquoscrystal</a>
I can&#39;t wait to see what samsung does
shall me me mix 😂😂😂😂
id rock it
hello<br>suported 4G+?
I&#39;m in love with it already 😍
I don&#39;t like it ;-;
(´ . .̫ . `)bilibili干杯🍻
does it have front camera!???
&quot;roughly $500&quot;<br>I guess this video shot the demand for the phone sky-high, cause I cannot find it anywhere for less than $750
xiaomi Mi Mix would be awesome phone, @uulimaa
please do a W2016 review! people n the states would freak out over that shit
not worth it
&quot;Pixel Launcher&quot; .... :( RIP NEXUS!!
&quot;Pixel Launcher&quot; .... :( RIP NEXUS!!
niceeeeeeeee
Great review! I just bought one from CHINA!!!! getting it in on the 13th love this phone.  I was one of those phones are so boring people thankful for this piece of art!
xiaomi mi mix mmng ckup cntik lh..
Great phone but over priced
i saw it,touch it last week.its really great.big screen and beautiful.
Watching this on my mi mix.<br>Best fone I&#39;ve had in my life.<br>Although mine has a loose back panel in the right hand portion so becareful if you buy it make sure you check that the back dosnt creek when you apply pressure. <br>I&#39;m returning it for another so hopefully it&#39;s not an issue with all of the phones.<br>If it is it&#39;s a deal breaker for me as the back will most likely pop out after using it for a while.
Oh yeah. Iam Proud of u China!
Beautiful &lt;3
Ordered mine from China yesterday and scheduled for delivery Monday with DHL Express... only $30 for shipping. Can&#39;t wait!! What will I do with my jet black iPhone 7+??
Pixel Xl blue would really be great. But in general any phone would be good. It would give a bit if shine to my bad year. Thanks before hand<br>@zaza_matias77
Pixel XL
小米MIX 4GB+128B 3499元人民币
(˶‾᷄⁻̫‾᷅˵)
слишком большой, был бы он 5 дюймов...
a new future
Caught my eye right off the bat I will consider purchase for sure.
It is releasing here in Pakistan in few days can&#39;t wait at all
A turn of events, i phone 8 will copy xiaomi mi mix this time.
My iPhone looks like it belongs to eighties Era in comparison
$500 for 6GB of RAM, no bezel, 256GB of storage,  and 4400MaH battery??? how does Xiaomi make money off this??
I want it !!!
awesome！！
Wow
Did anyone else come here to see that poker table after watching the 360 studio tour video?
最近几乎每隔一段时间都会来翻下这个视频底下的评论，这个视频是Marques最近一年来发布的所有视频里除过iphone7点击量最高的，评论数比iphone那个视频多了几乎整整一万条，而且，不夸张的说，这是我出国以来见过外国人对中国产品好评与赞美最多的一次，这样一款革命性的产品得到的声誉大概是做世界工厂一辈子都不会赚来的，小米这次，干得漂亮。
does anyone know where the wallpaper is from?
Not everything made in China sucks...
Am I late? seems that they&#39;re selling it for at least 835.. scrap that. I&#39;ll just wait for a 32GB version.
This phone looks like from the serie Black Mirror,  love it!
Those specs are fantastic, I&#39;d definitely buy that phone.
for the price it needs wireless charging and sd card....
I&#39;d rock that
vengo por unocero
This is a step in the right direction- these bezels need to go.
this phone is turbine performance but it looks so poor and weird
Is this phone also launched in US?
5 years from now there will be no bezels at all.
getting iphone 7 rose gold instead ha
Get it in white and you&#39;ll have the phone from Black Mirror S03E01 &quot;Nosedive&quot;
Are you selling it? If you are hit me up. Definitely wan&#39;t to get one.
are the pixels visible on this screen
can u put the link from where to buy the same hoodie you wearing<br>I really liked it<br>and would like to have one
Holy shit the Chinese actually made something instead of just shamelessly copying!!!  <br><br>Good job xiaomi. <br><br>And BTW,  it&#39;s not pronounced shoomi,  it&#39;s pronounced &quot;siaomi&quot;
Looks great and the price makes it sound even better.
xiaomi are for China only but you can get one very easily from online stores.There very popular here in Greece the last year,great phones and miui is great rom.
This is so beautiful.
Only in China unfortunately! :/
does it have a headphone jack tho?
800$ for the 4gb/128gb model. 1100 bucks for the 6gb/256gb model. This ain&#39;t even close to 500$ XDDD Still, looking quite nice, might pick it up once the price drops down lol.
wish it was $500 :/
I&#39;m probably in the minority here, but I&#39;d gladly lose the front camera in exchange for a full screen edge to edge.
The wallpaper at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=35">00:35</a>, is anyone who have it ?
I don&#39;t know why it keeps bezel at the bottom then move front cam to the right bottom. this is kinda weird.
Downsize mix to 5.5 inch with same CPU RAM but 128Gb memory and 3000 mah will sell like hot cakes !
The camera quality is great!
what is this in your hand? Like watch or something? I need the name
Why can&#39;t they ever have stock or close-to-stock Android? It would be cheaper for them and a much cleaner experience, and it&#39;s not like this phone has any trouble standing out.
Still not in the US of A. <br>I might get this or the note 8
Finally somebody has inovated, huh?
This device is gorgeous
Bruh. This shit is lit 🔥😍😩
I don&#39;t know if i&#39;d be able to own something like this... would be so paranoid of dropping it
I would love one! please
is this not available in India?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=55">0:55</a> leafyishere?
O.O Wow! Just wow!
Mkhhd the ceramic is really durable. I doubt it will scratch or crack
please name the song you play on starting of video!!!
hey Marcus what&#39;s that song playing at the start?? ...it&#39;s awesome!!
There are phones like this... and then there&#39;s an iPhone. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23courage">#courage</a> XD
Looks dope😍
The title is misleading!  Pathetic, NO TO ALL CHINA PRODUCT!
should i buy Pixel or Mi Mix..... I&#39;m confused🤔
damn it has DAC also..
very good review
can we have more of this in samsung, motorola and LG phones please?
Software looks awful and the giant design (other than screen of course) is just okay, but other than that, damn... And it&#39;s not that expensive too.
OMG, this is exactly what is needed from phones. It seems ridiculous that televisions can go almost completely bezel-less on something as big as a 50&#39;-70&#39; screen and be thinner than a phone, yet cell phones today keep following the same formula.<br><br>I wish I could go out and pick one of these up right now, I&#39;m in the market for a new phone and this could definitely be my daily driver.
This what phone manufacturers need to be doing is to be pushing the boundaries of a smartphones capabilities. Different is good and and that&#39;s what consumers want.
I feel like Apple is gonna rip this off lol
Holy shit! 256 gb storage. I&#39;m replying with my 16 gb iPhone.....
Bezelless phones are going to be the next big thing.
Apple will steal this concept  in the future   then claim it&#39;s their INNOVATION!!
I want this so badly. I was sad to hear it&#39;s China only.
I&#39;ve waited so long for a phone to replace my Nexus 6.
That looks beautiful. I really hope it gets released in the US.
I want that phone
Oh my Lord.
looks amazing! want it!
Huawei, One Plus, ZTE and now Xiaomi? Wow,  let&#39;s see what competition breeds! This phone looks awesome.
I would love to get my hands on this Phone !!! I googled it and the prices are insane right now it&#39;s almost 800 euros :O !!! DAMN !!!
The perfect phone, and why is it so cheap, oh my god I need one
somebody please ive been looking for the blue and yellow wallpaper at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=106">1:46</a> for like an hour now and i give up, if anybody can point me in the right direction that would be grealy appreciated ta
All I want is that Wallpaper in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=106">01:46</a>  😂 MKHB, Where can I get that?
if the camera was not down this phone would be the best phone ranked as by performance look and price. Camera at the bottom Idea is sick but not everyone would love that
Does anyone know what notebook that is under the phone at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7plA1ALkQw&amp;t=23">0:23</a>?
I had the aqous but now I have the iPhone 7 helava jump in phones
I would get rid of my note7 4 this
yes i would... awesome stuff
This is amazing, I haven&#39;t been so excited about phones since I first got a smartphone. A whole new beautiful design with top specs.
apple? its even better than s7 more or less.
Meh, why don&#39;t they sell this in America... I would buy this thing so fast.
I&#39;m down to buy one of these, even if it doesn&#39;t come to the us.
So... where can I buy it?
I keep coming back to watch this phone... <br><br><b>sigh</b> they should have named it Xiaomi Mona Lisa. it&#39;s beautiful 😍
If only the battery were removable..
I want one but look at the price!
It&#39;s very very hard to snap up the xiaomi phone in great demand in xiaomiofficial website .  My wife got the xiaomi 5s from the online reseller in &quot;<a href="https://www.jd.com/">https://www.jd.com/</a>&quot; with adding 100 RMB last month.
can someone give me a link to that same exact wallpaper ?
As a gay man, I feel this does a lot for our community.
I have been fallen in love with this phone just from the review. But I think I will wait for a while before deciding to buy it because I want to see if any problems will come up to it...
the bad thing its gonna crack ever time it falls
Beautiful.
This phone has more ram than my PC...  sob2x
How do you get the google play store to work on this phone?
nice car
@mkbhd please do a review of the MI MIX
When do you think it will receive the Android 7.0 Nougat update?
Can someone explain, why everyone says 4.400mah instead of 4.4Ah?
watching this from Another blockbuster from Xiaomi, The Redmi note 3 pro!!☺
If it only had an IR blaster I would buy it now. Looking to replace my S5.
阴吹思婷
I would definitely rock this phone. I love the way it looks and the specs are solid!!!!
this will be my next mirror phone
what is the sound quality like for phone calls
It Looks like leafy No chin
Can you give this phone away? To me... ??? call me maybe
and sheep&#39;s be like...only Apple does innovation😤
this is changing the world about people thinking about Chinese products
Cool video, cool phone!
I hope the iPhone 8 will be bezeless like this one.
can u use it with T-mobile?
You bet...
256gb????
The ceramic looks so good
Such a cool phone. This is what the industry needs.
Will it be on Verizon or at&amp;t or t-mobile or sprint?
Small chin much like Leafy
I&#39;d buy the phone internally
FUCK!&gt;?! /... sorry . this is sick.... 256??? holy s.....
Yes I would, rock that sick dope. What I say&quot;
If only you could use this phone on project fi.
If only apple made this phone, people would kill for it.
700 euro thats too much.It looks nice but other smartphones have the same specs and that for 300 euro.
What a rom is it running on yours?
where can I get that wallpaper
I agree, this is the phone of the year that really caught my attention. the new ones from samsung, sony, iphone are all so boring... this made me excited again of having a new phone
aaichi gaand
Where can i get these xiaomi phones?<br>Aliexpress?<br>Dhgate?
Is thiz phone available in online purchase
+Google please make a US version, maybe pixel squared could be bezeless?
what is a bezel?

Beautiful phone!
man, can I ask you a question that how can you buy a mi mix phone in America, even though I am in China, I cannot snap up this new phone
