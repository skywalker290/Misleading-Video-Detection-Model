Cute
Hi
She should have put this in the movie😤
amazing actress
Local train Bangalore Kabse Jane lag gai
Ayaan❤️
When she cry omg realistic feel🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺best actress ever ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Awesome acting alia really u r very talented
Alia is copying kareena kapor from the beginning, her acting, everything like kareena&#39;s copy,
The lahza of safeena&#39;s father was so on point 💯
Murad don&#39;t deserve her
This scene is a prime example that when parents make the first step and lower down a little for their children&#39;s happiness then they promise to be real with them too!
I wish every girl has such a courage to say no 🔥💔 .... Kuch Dil aur insan tootne se bach jaatein 🔥
Best emotional scene ever 😘🥰😊😇
Bhai he seen movie mai kaha hai
Bangalore ki train 😜
isn&#39;t the boy in the beginning jannat zubair&#39;s brother
Alia not a leading lady , she is supporting actor in this movie. she deserves best supporting actress award . Not leading lady award in filmfare.
Ayaan zubair is looking soooooo cute and handsome 💗💗💗💗💗♥️♥️♥️💟💟💟
Alia banglore vali train me hai. Konsi local train mumbai se banglore jati hai😂😂😂
Such a bad acting of Aliya....
Ayaan zubair is also acting nowadays wo😁
Ayaan zubair ❤️❤️❤️🤩🥰😍😍🤩❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Same situation... Aysha suicide
Banglore ki train Mumbai ki local train jaisi kab SE ho gyi kitna buddhu banate hai movie vale😂😂
This scene is so important. It actually portrays the little freedom that safeena and many other women like her want. She doing makeup is significant of her want for freedom in her life. This is also important to show why safeena had the defense mechanism always working when it came to Murad which led to her toxic and violent behavior.
Mumbai local banglore kab jaane lagi
Local train goes to Bangalore? Kabhi local train mein baithe hue logo ne ye movie banayi hoti to pata hota, Ameer log ......
Itna asan thori hota h
is nalli ko rona tak niii aata aur ye bnegi tapppp actresss
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9EkgHlHjpQ&amp;t=10">0:10</a> is that boy ayaan zubair?
I het Aaliya, Annya
Nice Ayan Zubair
Plzz uploaded  this movie
I would love to watch uncut version of gully boy
i dont know why people trouble her in the name of nepotism..She had done a brilliant acting in movies like Gully boy, Highway.....When some people raised voice against nepotism, the motive is to bring that person down who doesnt have any talent ,hardwork, passion and entered the film industry .Eventhough in the first movies she didnt act well, with time a wonderful actor has been evolved from her.. So appreciate her for that
Such nice parents..... Safeena is really lucky
Ayan is so cute😍
It should have been in the movie

This scene is very important for movie and Ayaan zubair fans why they cut 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
If I will ever produce a movie...it&#39;s gonna be with Farhan Akhtar. He knows how to pick talent. Ashish K Bhatia ( remember the name)
Ayan❤️❤️
Her acting is so hilarious LOL
and dumb fucks say that Alia Bhatt can&#39;t act and is same like other non talented starkids 🤣.
Vo Ayan zubair hai na
Alia depicted safeena perfectly
Hello Alia Bhatt kya hua hai jo Chitthi Lekar de rahi ho han lag raha hai tu Ho
So did she lie to her parents about fleeing to bangalore just to attend murad&#39;s rap competition?  Or i got it wrong
Full movie please
👌👌👍
I think even interval was better than this .
Aloooo😍😍😍
Nd there are some people..saying alia bhatt can&#39;t act
Ayaan 🤣🤣🤣
My daughter name is also safeena
I know again for all good people..This video is for all who respect our parents...And for even who do not.. Anything and any one is close by.🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗👍👍
After doing soooooo much drama <br>Ha mai aa rahi hu ma sorry <br>ABEY GAYI KAYKO BE
I love you my cute alu your so natural I mean no heavy makeup simple dressing but acting is on high level 😔😔😔😎😎😎😎😎😍😍😍😍
This is my Opinion : She Deserves the FilmFare Award
Were is Mallika Singh
Zubair
Allah ho allah
Ayaan yaah
Alia&#39;s actingg uffff❤❤❤❤❤Love you baby!
boycott   Alia Bhatt said in coffee with Karan that she wanted Sushant Singh Rajput dead.
Girlfriend should be like her.
Jannat jubair ka vaai ha kya

Ayaan Zubair will be famous when he grows up
Bakwas movie
Disgusting movie
Don&#39;t feel like watching Alia bhatt
Gandu kuttiya
ch*tiya movie/-
Kya bakwaas acting hai alia bhatt ki iss film mein. Koi aisa memorable scene Nahi hai Alia Ka Jo Yaad rakkhe.
Ye to aayan zubair h ..
I think Filmfare also consider deleted scenes 😬😬
I understand gali k kutte...
ye to jannat jubair ka bhai he
Where was Mallika Singh in this movie?
@@@@@@@@@@@
I understand how much people love this movie, so do I, but adding this will disturb the flow of the movie. It&#39;s perfect the way it is. Perhaps, she should release an unedited version for the fans.
Aysi ladki ko mar jana chahiye
Il yu aaliya
💕💕
Nice act...nice feel
Wooww so good ...whenu u crying aliaa ....I like your crying ....smile some Time😄🙏
Good newz
How r u saiee...🤘all good..😎

I&#39;m very happy that gullyboy got so many filmfare award.... amazing movie
GOI $1,000,000 Jewellary gift to Alia bhatt.....Oil Reserves dont forget......Alhamduillah Inshallah......
This type of clip in hijab.....Alhamduillah........
Promotion of maybelline creamy matte lipstick was on point 😂😂
The mom&#39;s acting is so perfect!✌️👍
whenever Alia comes on screen, she makes my heart ache and makes me want to reach out to her and give a hug.
Nice performance ...ekadam real
I just love this scene. It is so real, so natural and close to all of us
😂😂😂
i wish if zoya made the movie in two volumes
I see why it was deleted. It&#39;s a great scene but it would&#39;ve disrupted the pace of the film.
This scene has to be in the film !!
Delete krne ki zrurt Ni thi.....
No one-<br>Le Other movies~ getting views on deleted scenes.<br>Le Gully Boy~Making short films on deleted scenes.🤣
Ye jannat k bhai h n
Why aren&#39;t the scenes included in the movie?
Brillint performance
Web series hi bana dete wese bhi KJo ke kachre se to bahut achchi hoti
Omg! Good one, I wonder why they deleted this scene?
this scene should have been in the movie.
Alia&#39;s phone conversation with the parents is not sincere. That&#39;s why may be it was cut.
Best part of deleted scenes due to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23divine">#DIVINE</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9EkgHlHjpQ&amp;t=168">2:48</a> Mumbai Local train Blore station bhi jata hai.. waah yeh hui naa baat
Is this ayaan zubair rehmani?
Female role ko completely ignore kardia movie main,<br>Only focusing on Murad (hero)😒😒
You can blame her for nepotism....but you cannot deny the very fact that she is a fantastic actress...... nepotism works in every industry every sector....... Only in Bollywood even if you belong to some influential background still people are going to judge your performance and based on that your career is made or destroyed........nepotism is sick but this girl is a real performer ...queen kangna..rockstar Alia...awesome Vidya... fantabulous Rani...global icon Priyanka.... quintessential Kareena and their powerpacked performances rule bollywood
This should have been a two part movie. It was amazing but the ending was rushed.
No doubt she is a fine actress,but she seems to repeat her crying style in every movies( highway,raazi,kalank..) Repetitive style of acting gradually start to bore the audience.
Subtitles guys, you have non-hindi speaking fans
Such nice parents.... Every body should get the such parents
Kiss scene daalo jo cut kia tha censor board ne..
What was there in the letter?
Youtube pe abhi gully boy ke episodes ke hi jalwe hain yaar ‘’ bahut hard’ 😎✌🏻
We want Directors Cut with all these scenes ... plssss !!!!
loved this movie...zoya you are a class apart. ranveer/Alia you both were breathtaking. Alia will you stop already looking so drop dead gorgeous in that hijab in the bus scene...beautiful girl
બુદ્ધુ
Kuch scenes agar hote to movie 200cr + kr jaati😥
Bhai ek baat bata, ye konsi LOCAL train hain jo Dharavi to Bangalore jati hain??? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🙄🙄
Bilali
Koi mujhe btao full movie kidr se dekhu mai....?
Emotional ho gaya bc mai to
Mujhe samajh ni aa RHA ranveer Singh movie Mai divine hai ya naezy...
Alia Is a fantastic actress.
They should have NOT deleted this scene... It was important... I was thinking during the last scenes of the movie that how can safeena just sneek out from the house n go to watch murad&#39;s performance in night without her parents knowing... That wasn&#39;t practical and the entire movie was practical... It didn&#39;t fit and felt hurried... After seeing this, it made sense... Much sense....
This scene should be there in the movie...
We want Gully Boy 2 with MC sher&#39;s story.
Street dancer 3D 😂<br>Please don&#39;t put your life in danger by watching this movie
Scene is all okay but when does Mumbai local go to Bangalore.
I was expecting alia will not recieve the call from her abbu ...but she quickly did...this weakened the entire plot
bhenchoo  एक बार मै पूरी movie क्यू नही डालते
best best best movie ever...
What a understanding man

Sach mein bhai iye tumhare episodes dekh ke lag raha tha ki  hum Gully Boy dekhte dekhte sho too nahi gaye the
This scene is better then the whole street dancer 3d movie 🤭
What a scene. I loved it. Gully Boy, love the film. No words for it. All gave their &quot;The Best&quot; performances.
why release the deleted scenes almost a year after the movie released?
zoya has confused the audience by deleting this scene. at the end of the movie, in the &quot;train song&quot;, we see safeena sneaking out to talk to murad on the phone while she tells her mom who was sitting on the bench in the train station that she will be right back. and in this scene, we see safeena&#39;s mom giving her approval to safeena and murad&#39;s relationship. deleting this scene just creates confusion as the audience keeps thinking that safeena keeps meeting with murad secretly.
I just loved this movie each and every scene
They should have kept this scene in the movie
Ek kaam karo deleted scenes ki ek alag <b>GullyBoy</b> Bana lena!
Ham chutiye hain kya,  tumne to series hi bana di exclusives ki. Movie 5 ghante ki kar dete, parts banaya dete do theek tha, ye kya tukdo mein maja dere. NOT FAIR<br>Rap to thik tha lekin is type ki scene ko movie k beech mein dekhne mein maza aata na us vibe mein. 4minute mein kahan aari wo feeling
bakwaas movie
I love alll the deleted scenes.  Yar why they delete if the movie become 3 hr long also I m comfortable to watch and i think many more peps love to watch .... I love gullyboy
Alia what a solid actor🔥
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23gullyboy2">#GullyBoy2</a> kab aane wala hai .... ?

Abey kb tk gullyboy krte rhoge
Bro emiway bantai ka kuch hai to dal <br>Like karo
local train kbse bangalore jaane lgi..
Alia bhatt is just nailed it
This scene should&#39;ve been included in the film.
Why the fuck was this scene not the movie? U guys r sick. What have u got by cutting these scenes? a few extra crores? haan...!!!
Why this scene was not in movie?
Saying for the sixth time, these scenes didn&#39;t deserved to be cutted out
I wish zoya would have realised we were ready to watch and would have been happy to watch 5 hours of this film. I wanted all these scenes. We were also invested in Safeena, sher, moeen&#39;s story equally.
They should make a movie on Safeena
I think it was a good decision to not add this scene. Seems too easy and plausible and might even make the parents hate Murad after this. It&#39;s easier to show that he has gained fame and recognition and the next challenge in their life is to convince the parents to accept him and leave it open ended. Everything can&#39;t be so easily solved. That&#39;s not how life works.
How to get views and subscribers. Just release some deleted scenes of a movie
Ab mujhe lag raha he deleted scenes ki seperate movie ban jayegi
Achha hua delete kiya ...emiway nai he isme
Superb
Yaar ye edit out nhi krna chahiye tha
