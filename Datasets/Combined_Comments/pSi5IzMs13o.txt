Is Felix really THIS stupid? The reason you don&#39;t want a light shining in your face is pretty self explanatory, especially when driving when its dark.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=548">9:08</a> in my experience some cars have brighter back lights than others, so it can be distracting as the driver when looking through the rear view mirror. Think of it light shining a flashlight just above your eyes and trying to focus on what‚Äôs in front of you I guess.

The interior car lights thing is a three part problem. The reason it used to be such a problem was because windshields used to be flatter and the interior decor used to be brighter, causing a lot of reflection off of the windshield, making it difficult to see where you were going. The second part is a battery issue. If it was left on all day, they could drain the battery due to older cars not being as energy efficient as newer ones. The third issue is that it makes your surroundings difficult to see. If the light is on inside the car, your eyes adjust and you can&#39;t see outside very well because of reflections of the inside of the car and your eyes not being adjusted to the dark.
My parents always told me not to leave the lights in the car on at night because it made seeing into the darkness more difficult, and the driving less safe. Now I want to check and see if that is even true ha
The light in the car thing... My parents told me that light gets reflected on wind shield and blocks view during night. And I believed it.

I&#39;ve seen the happy wheels episode...IT&#39;S EPIC!!! (I guess) lol
Lmao, like what happened to Mass Effect Andromeda, hate just to hate. The game wasn&#39;t perfect but let&#39;s admit it, it wasn&#39;t as trash as anything people suggested. I enjoyed the game. There was a couple glitch and a bit of lack of content at the end, but it was still great and enjoyable.
I dont think people called the guy out  who couldt write &#39;loading&#39; because some people is word blind, and no matter what people say. Pewdiepie was a but mean there. Dont come with dumb comments, im just making him know, even tho its a lo g time since.
Time Before Hell
The reason people turn of the light in the car is because it wastes electricity, so you have to restart the car with a separate battery.

The car light thing is that and the fact that by the next day the light drains the battery and your car is dead when your about to leave for work. I also remember my mom saying she didn‚Äôt want other people to be able to see into the car with just her and kids
Damn, rewatching some lwiay, and completely forgot the context of that gold hand clip thats in the new intro

I think the light thing is just because the light reflects and the driver can&#39;t see.
The amount of god damn quotes in this comment section is fucking staggering

There&#39;s a totally good reason not to turn on lights in a car while driving, if it&#39;s dark out you won&#39;t be able to see the outside as well if there&#39;s lights inside the car, my parents told me the reason when they told me not to do it, so I&#39;ve always known. You can&#39;t be driving when all you see in the window is your own reflection, you need to see the road.
Or maybe the glare is on the windshield and they can tsee
PewDiePie: everywhere I go I see his face
No pewds. The light causes glare on the wind shield at night

And this was his last video before hell happened.
how is it physically impossible to be faster than light? We already have objects in our universe that travel FTL. Speed is relative and depends from where it is measured. The whole &quot;the faster something is the more mass it gains&quot; makes no sense. Because we have whole galaxies move at near FTL already, which would make no sense as those would need to have already become black holes by that logic. In fact our own galaxy probably would have to as well, at least from the perspective of those galaxies.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=560">9:20</a> I think it also might be because when it‚Äôs dark outside it‚Äôs a little bit of a distraction? Like when you go from a dark room to outside and can‚Äôt see anything because your eyes haven‚Äôt adjusted. If you look into the light then back at the road you might have temporary vision impairment. Just don‚Äôt look into the light tho like come on üò≠

‚Äú...ok I take it back, this person is right‚Äù LMAO
Its called being night blind, it also happens when there are lights mounted on the roof at it reflects off the hood, which actually lessens your vision. This happens because your eyes get adjusted to the light, so it is harder to see things in the dark
Wow I got a mr beast ad on the cornament
I haven&#39;t thought about it much <br>But pewds is going to retire one day.

Kpop stans on twitter need to hear what Pewds said here, the &#39;always complaining&#39; fans are also in his fandom. Since we don&#39;t know what our Idols think, we should take heed of what he&#39;s saying. He&#39;s got more experience and an be trusted though these are very different fandoms
Can we just know something, Felix? Why is it always Full metal Alchemist?
Hmmm the pic in the thumbnail looks like a melon..... coincidence? I think not
rewind the decade because 2020 sucks
The reason why u don‚Äôt turn on the light in the car is that when it is dark it is harder to look outside if it is light inside. üíï
For the light thing I was told because the light reflects onto the window and is a distraction

I thought if that light was on you can‚Äôt see in the  rear view mirror
The reason you shouldn‚Äôt turn on car lights at night is because it makes it harder for the driver to see in the dark as your eyes have adjusted to light, and the light can distract other drivers because it stands out :)

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=560">9:20</a> its because of the reflection of the light in the windscreen, at night it can be really difficult to see

night driving when you got the dome light on obstructs your vision out the windshield, and is the most annoying thing on the planet. legitimately enough to make me contemplate dropping you off in the middle of nowhere and just leaving you there. probably not going to do it, cause I am not that guy. that said, just know, I have a searing anger towards you that will never subside.

i think the reason why you should keep the indoor car light off is cause it can blind the drivers vision by shining onto the windshield.
A lots happened in just 6 months.
So felix and pewdiepie used to be in good terms. I wonder what happened that made pewdiepie so mad with felix now
What&#39;s crazy is loading and loding are both pronounced the same way so he was technical right in his way
&quot;That&#39;s why I dont like big cities because idk&quot;
The inside car light shines in the mirror and messes up the drivers view
that edit definitely made me cry a lil <br>i freakin love you pewds<br>its been amazing having you to watch throughout my whole life
shout out physicists
Actually they turn the light off because if child leave it on, it kill car battery in a day or so.
It&#39;s because the car light wastes energy when you leave it on
pewds why.
What happened in the past 5 months , you really liked felix in this video but now you two dont seem to get along very well :(
i liked this video it was funny (: happy comment gang (:
its an issue because when its dark outside and its light inside its hard to see out the windshield sometimes and it can cause an accident. thats what they taught me when i was studying for my licence

Is driving with your interior lights on illegal? <br>We&#39;re going to put this one in the large file called Dad Myths. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a fine on the books for doing it, and the whole idea of &quot;map lights&quot; is that someone in the passenger seat might need to use them while you&#39;re driving, although less so in the sat nav era.<br><br>The main interior light is also handy for finding out just how far your son or daughter has stuck that jelly bean up their nose so you know whether you need to pull over. But the fact is, it&#39;s very annoying to the driver to operate a vehicle at night while they&#39;re on, which is why just about every Dad, ever, has said at some stage or other &quot;Turn those bloody lights off, it&#39;s illegal you know!&quot;<br><br>While a specific fine isn&#39;t listed on the RTA&#39;s informative list of things you can be booked for, we reckon a police officer with initiative could still find some way to slap you for it, because the fact is it does create unnecessary and unsafe reflection on the windscreen, and driving with interior lights on is thus best kept to a minimum.

Pewds the light must stay off in cities because of all of the light and lampposts that might look like it in the reflection of a mirror or window and cause a car crash
chair gang<br>Cringe üòë
If the light is on you won&#39;t be able to see with your rearview mirror
The reason why putting the inside car light on is dangerous, is because the driver will have more difficulty seeing outside since his surronding is illuminated.
On his thumbnail he kinda looks like scarce Lol
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=522">8:42</a> - When our parents drove through a long tunnel/it turned night, the back seat became pitch black. (At no other time are children expected to sit silently in complete darkness with their family,) so we instinctively clicked on the ceiling light. Parents suddenly couldn&#39;t see the road, (because the interior reflections on the windshield became brighter than the road [lit by headlights].) &quot;You&#39;re going to get us killed! Turn that light off!&quot; I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m Typing this.
i have finished terraria and i understand the meme
Ugh he was once chair gang <b>cringe</b>
Damn..... i kinda care.
That nice video almost made my man tears come out
The one golden parenting rule followed all round the world: lie to you children about the car light  <br><br><br>I confronted my mom about it when I was 16 and she told me allegedly the car battery can die if you leave the light on too long
pewds: <b>says he has seen jojo and understands the memes</b><br>also pewds: <b>sees jojo referance</b><br>also also pewds: &quot;omg Is this fullmetal Alchemist?&quot;
Crows???
Lmfao the rewind dude managed to slip the bridge clip in there and still get a big pp rating
Bruh why that dude with the edit throughout the decade put the n-word clip come on bruh
Pewds
The reason the light is annoying is because of the glare on glasses. For my dad&#39;s car, if I left the light on, it would reflect off the window and onto his glasses. He&#39;d tell me to turn it off because of that.
When pewds says &#39;when i retire,&#39; does that mean he wont make anymore vids :(
Hey I fixed it.  PEWBS
i play pixelings
We dont open the light in the car at late hours , bc is brighter than the road ahead and the driver see the reflection of the kids
mid 90s is a skateboarding movie not about living in the 90s about skating in the 90s
I watched cats..... haven‚Äôt slept science
If the light is on at night it&#39;s hard for the driver to see sometimes
Pewds: &quot; is that a Full Metal Alchemist reference?&quot;<br>Me: going through the comments section to see who is offended.
It JoJo reference

You dont turn on lights in car at night, because it makes reflection in windscreen, and it can be harder for driver to see the road... :)

my dad said to not turn on the light because it was hard to the road
we used to have an old car where if you left the light on, the car battery would die xD don&#39;t ask me how, but that&#39;s how I learned NOT to turn that light on longer than necessary ^^&#39;
Its jojo

If you leave the light on...it kills your battery...more annoying than just going to turn the light back off.

how about a nostalgic let&#39;s play from Age of Empires? still love that game :&#39;D
The reason that people say not to turn off the light in the car is it for some reason people believe that it&#39;ll affect the light coming from the headlights of the car when you&#39;re on the road it&#39;s stupid

ik why they dont let is turn on the lights its because it uses nore gasoline
My mom said when the light‚Äôs on and she‚Äôs driving it adds glare and it‚Äôs a distraction which I understand (night driving obvi cause there‚Äôs not really a point for the light in the day)
The issue is that it is harder to see out of your windshield at night whenever the inside of your car is lit up.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=528">8:48</a> why my mom didn&#39;t let us turn on the lights is because, my mom said that children get kidnapped and cops mainly go for cars that have their light on inside the car because most kidnappers have that light as an indication for some odd reason, i dunno that&#39;s just what my mom said.
The main thing is, people need to think for themselves.

the reason why people get mad when you turn them on at night is because it reflects off the windshield and could cause the driver to get into an accident.
Did you see that the I cant sleep meme kinda looked like vy&#39;s secret message bag
To be fair, r/pewdz is pretty shit. <br>Highlights are great but it isn&#39;t something to join or keep an eye on. <br>And besides that it completely screws up your feed.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=566">9:26</a> No it is because your iris will expand and not be able to see the dark road and you will end up crashing
Doesn‚Äôt know who dr nefario is.....dear god
The thing with the light is that it&#39;s easier to see the outside road at night if your sitting in a completely dark car instead of having a light inside your car.<br>Since out parents dont see that well due to the age they want it shut off to see better
r/PewDiePieSubmissions is kinda shit tho. All the memes are cringe, low effort, and old. Its full of serial reposters, liars, and karmawhores. I don&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve seen anything that is somewhat good. You can find the occasional decent post but almost all the posts are terrible.

What does lwiay mean?
Fun fact: the reason (maybe) you can&#39;t turn the light on for too long is because it would make a reflection on the rear window of the car, making the rear part of the car a blind spot for the driver.
I thought parents didn&#39;t like the light being left on because it drains the car battery.

Best intro üòÇ
I was told the reason why they hate turning the lights on is because it distracts the person driving behind you which I think is bull cuz you can‚Äôt see shit in some people‚Äôs windows
The reason you dont turn on the light in the car while driving is because you can impair or blind other drivers with the light or causing distractions leading up t o a crash
when the light is on and its dark, the drivers vision is impared, therefore more likely to friggin die
lmao im watching this on my nintendo 2ds get on my level [not even joking]
Some people have issues with night blindness and astigmatisms that make it so they can&#39;t see out of the car with the lights on. Very common with age, especially with women who have been pregnant.
you dont turn the light on in the car cause it glares in the windscreen? s:

Felix. I asume Sweden have the same trafic laws as Denmark. It is ilegal to drive with the cabin lights turned on when it is dark outside, reason is driver in the car cant see as clear due to the light going into the purpils and makes them smaller when the driver needs to have larger purpils to see in the dark outside, its like a camera rly. also other drivers that drives towards you can get confused by the cabin lights. The fine in Denmark is 1500DKK.

Nope when it&#39;s dak outside the car and you mut the light inside the car on you create a mirror effect. When that happens you can&#39;t see or hardly see what&#39;s outside the car but it&#39;s not illegal just dangerous or so my dad said

sorry pewds but the real reason why people were thought not do put on car lights is because people can&#39;t see the outside when its dark outside en light inside.

At night the light inside the car reflects off the windshield and makes it more difficult to see outside.
Who is seeing this video on 2020
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=545">09:05</a>  It&#39;s an issue because it hurts your dark adaption.<br><br><br>Seeing in low-light conditions is accomplished via the rod cells in your retina.  They require a pigment called rhodopsin, which is destroyed when hit by light.  It also requires plentiful beta carotene as a precursor chemical, which is why eating carrots (rich in beta carotene) is beneficial to night vision.  No, it&#39;s not a myth - the idea that carrots don&#39;t help vision is the myth.<br><br><br>It takes about half an hour for your eyes to reach rhodopsin saturation, where your night vision is at its best.  When you turn on the cabin light inside a car, you are destroying rhodopsin at an increased rate.  You are making your night vision worse, which makes you a worse driver at night.<br><br><br>That&#39;s why all sensible people do not leave the cabin lights on while driving at night, whether they are aware of these facts or not.

Pewds, you dummy. The reason you turn off your interior lights, is because it makes it more difficult to see outside of the car.
That‚Äôs the guys from despicable me
Felix, the &quot;don&#39;t turn on the car light&quot; thing is about the light leaving a reflection on the windshield when driving. That reflection can distract the driver or obscure something on the road, that&#39;s why our dads usually told us not to play with it during road trips and so on. I mean, come on now, I thought everybody after a certain age realizes this, especially after they had driven at night even once in their lifetime
PP REVIEW
When the lights are on in the car, that light fills your eyes too and make it more difficult to focus on the lights outside, the headlights of the cars on the other side of the road or the brakelights of people in front of you. So yes, please don‚Äôt keep them on if you‚Äôre the passenger, more courteous for the driver to turn them off.

for the lights tho...its cuz it reflects in the mirror and it blocks the vie from the back , so u cant see if theres a car behind or if it is u cant see the lights when they wanna change lanes or smth , at least for me i cant see em if theres a light turned on XD idk
When the netflix just shooting my shot tweet came up I instantly had the Divine song &quot;shoot your shot&quot; in my head
The reason why people tell their kids to turn off the light in the car is because when you drive at night the light in the car will mess with your natural night vision and you wont be able to see the road clearly for a short while. As for day time? Dunno
nice
you are not suppose to turn on the light in the back becuase it gonna reflect in the front glass of the car so the driver doesent see a shit and youre gonna crash:)
The dome lights being on make it so you can&#39;t see through your rear view mirror.

It&#39;s true, from the wikipedia page for Grumman F-11 Tiger &quot;The F-11 Tiger is noted for being the first jet aircraft to shoot itself down. On 21 September 1956, during a test-firing of its 20 mm (.79 in) cannons, pilot Tom Attridge fired two bursts midway through a shallow dive. As the trajectory of the cannon rounds decayed, they ultimately crossed paths with the Tiger as it continued its descent, disabling it and forcing Attridge to crash-land the aircraft; he survived.&quot;

Actually, the interior lights in the car are not supposed to be on, because they make reflections of the interior in the windows, which could potentially block the drivers view, and could be dangerous. You&#39;re welcome.

Turning on your car lights inside the car, when it&#39;s dark, can severely mess up peoples(boomers) &quot;night vision&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s like when you walk inside a dark house after being out in the sun. A lot of people can lose their night vision focus from having the lights turned on in their face.

the light can cause glare on the windshield and stop you from being able to see out  eg wait til its dark open your curtains/blinds and turn on your lights and try looking out your window youll see yourself now apply it to your car  same result

You don&#39;t turn the light on in the car while driving, because if it&#39;s dark outside than inside the glass will partial act like a mirror. Obscuring vision of the driver. I thought Pewds would understand that.

No the car light thing is because when its dark you cant see outside very well !!!!!!
Riiiiigt....Because..Friends....AND MONEY..(NECTAR BED)
&quot;I still have fun reviewing it&quot; Pewds plz. ur reacting not reviewing.
No the light thing is because if it&#39;s brighter inside the car than outside the windshield will reflect the inside of the car instead of showing the road. It&#39;s generally not too bad but if it&#39;s very dark outside and you have too many lights on inside it can be dangerous.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=570">9:30</a> no it‚Äôs because it distracts the other drivers from where I live
The problems with the light still being on while the motor is not running, is that the battery could be drained empty(especially in winter), also what I was told as a kid is, that when you drive at night and theres a light on, it blinds the driver.
2020?
No, they hate when we turn the light on, cause if we forget them on, we can drain the batteries from the car which causes the car to stop working
The car light also runs down the battery tell a fast

Turning on the light in a car while it&#39;s dark outside will make the windows reflect and reduce your eye&#39;s light sensitivity, which can make it difficult to see out of the car.

those lights in the car are usually automatically turned on whenever a door is open. So if they are being turned on by people and not by the warning system one cannot tell if the door is open :)
He fell off
For now, the peepee is inconclusive.
No when the light is left on overnight it drains the battery and the car has to be jump-started
Yo people! The end of this decade is next year! Chill
They ask you to keep the lights off in the car at night because when it‚Äôs brighter in the car than outside the light reflection on the glass decreases visibility.
I had a dream that I saw brad (dressed like marzia of course) and I asked him ‚Äúis math related to science?‚Äù and he bought me a baguette
Kinda feeling like mrbeast is a little overrated i mean he is a wholesome guy but without the money, would he has that much subscribers tho? Or content worth watching?
Dont disrespect techno
I think that the light thing is because if you are in the front seat, the reflection in the windshield at night can be hard to see through idk
I got a mr beast honey ad on this video.
My parents always told me to not turn on the light because at night when there is light comming from inside the car you can&#39;t see the road that well, and that can be dangerous

If it&#39;s dark and you turn your interior lights on, it reduces your ability to see ahead of you because your eyes adjust to the brightness
The decade starts in 2021
No , turning on the light in the car , while you&#39;re in the backseat , doesn&#39;t allow the rider to see cars that are behind cuz of the mirror that u use to see cars behind u , the one in the middle of the car idk what it&#39;s called lol ,n not seeing cars behind u could cause accidents , that&#39;s y it&#39;s illegal

Game viwl sin
Wasting the car battery is one of the reasons for people not liking the light on.<br>But it&#39;s also because it&#39;s kind of distracting for the driver and if it&#39;s dark outside, the light from inside the car can make it difficult to see outside clearly.
Like video
The real reason for car light things is when your family goes on a trip to California and you leave on the light for a weak and a half and have to call your grandparents to come jumpstart your car at the airport.
yes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=315">5:15</a>. No. People that walk slow are just high hence the ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù
I was told by my driving instructor that you shouldn&#39;t have the lights on in the car while you&#39;re driving at night because it can be distracting and can reduce your ability to see what&#39;s going on in front of the car.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=550">9:10</a> i know the reason my parents would freak out was bc if i left the light on, it drained the car battery.. and then the car would need a jump-start the next time we used it. but pewds is right, that problem doesn&#39;t really exist anymore with automatic lights.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=555">9:15</a> it&#39;s because it&#39;s hard to see other cars out of the rear mirror.

The Light in the car is dangerous at night, because it can worsen the sight of the driver ( reflections in the Glas and so on ) and it could distract other drivers.

about the car lights i have a fairly old car now 22 years and the problem with the thing is that its so bright you start seeing your own reflection instead of the god damn road when driving at night. So it&#39;s not illegal but still hella anoying as you can&#39;t see the road when its not lit up good enough.

the light in the car is for ppl walking on the side of the road without any refexes is unseeable when the light is on blinding ur side of ur eye so it&#39;s for others sercurity
If you are driving during the night and it is really dark and then a passenger suddenly turn on the light within the car it can impair the view of the road. Making it dangerous. Also, I can imagine the light reflecting on the glass making also impairing the view.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=380">6:20</a> i legit posted someone their art and tagged them and even asked them if i could post, they agreed, comments: ah i see a karma whore<br>it got taken down for &quot;chainposting&quot; <br>IT WAS MY FIRST POST, I HAD REDDIT FOR 2 DAYS
that was a jojo reference
parents tell you not to click the lights because if you forget them on overnight in the morning the car wont have batteries and it wont start
If you are feelind stressed or want to work on bigger projects, i think many if not all your fans would not mind weekly uploads, good art cannot be rushed ;)

The WiFi router thing:<br>Just buy a NodeMCU for $2 and make it Beacon all of those networks....
isn&#39;t the light inside the car thing about it disrupts the view if it&#39;s dark outside? Bc it reflects in the windows if it&#39;s that much brighter inside than it is outside. It&#39;s not really a problem if you drive in cities and such but if you live in the middle of nowhere and it actually gets dark outside for real then it&#39;s gonna make it impossible to see.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=685">11:25</a> The no new content meme was a gag meme, I hope obviously.. It&#39;s a matter of easily browsable data that pewdiepies content rotates regularly, and more often that not people ask unsuccessfully for things to be reinstated (Fridays with Pewds is a common one, and not sure I&#39;ll never tire of Minecraft).I see you had to generate a somewhat attention grabbing and controversial question to make it one, showing that you know you&#39;re writing into a crowded schedule
Has Felix seriously still not watched Jojo&#39;s? It&#39;s a meme machine.
Umm... guys? The new decade starts next year.<br>Think about it: the first decade (10 years) started from year 1 until year 10. The second decade was 11-20. We‚Äôre still in the same decade.<br>Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
you ever just have inconclusive pp?
About the light thing, in my opinion at night you should leave the lights in the car turned off because you can see better outside. If it&#39;s darker inside it will seem brighter outside

Y is it on krakens whos ur daddy playlist
The reason you aren&#39;t supposed to turn the reading lights on while driving is because it reduces visibility at night. Having a brighter interior makes the outside more difficult to see, and could also cause reflections or glare on the inside of the windshield, further reducing visibility.
Also the microtransactions are pretty bad...
NOOOOOOOO PewDiePie don&#39;t give up on Terraria!

The bloody car light causes glare on the windscreen, mainly at night.  So it is dangerous. It&#39;s the same concept as closing the blinds when watching tv cause it causes glare. Turn them dang lights off.
what is pewdiepies subreddit name?

If you turn on the light in the car at night then you can‚Äôt really see out the rear view mirror that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs sketchy.
No, if lights are left on it kills the battery

Actually pewds, the reason you don‚Äôt turn on the car lights is because it makes it difficult to see out the front window due to reflection properties of the glass. And in daytime we always want to yell at our kids
The light in the car thing reduces visibility actually

My parents were fine with the light being on as long as we warned them beforehand and shut it off when we were done
I was personally attacked when he said Terraria was over ;-;
PEWDS NEVER SAY DIE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSi5IzMs13o&amp;t=550">9:10</a> the reason why is because it is dangerous because it makes it harder to see. It can cause a wreck. Also it is illegal. At least where I live.
Lmao, every anime he sees he says &quot;Is this full metal alchemist?&quot;
When theres light on inside the car and its dark out, its harder to see because the light reflects back from the windows. Open up the curtains in your living room at midnight and see if you can see past the person staring back at you
Dads turn off the roof light because headlights used to be crappy and the light inside the car made it even harder to see at night. Nowadays with streetlights everywhere and better headlights on every car and better roads and markings and guardrails etc than in the 70‚Äôs that it‚Äôs not relevant anymore.
The reason we shouldnt turn on lights while driving is because light in the foreground is making it hard to see while driving at night
This sub has gone to shit .
