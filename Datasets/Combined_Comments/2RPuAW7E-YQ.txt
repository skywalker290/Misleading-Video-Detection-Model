I loved dhindhora..but honestly..this romance works more than between tara and BB there.. maybe it&#39;s the direction or the chemistry between the actors..
2023 and still masterpiece for me ❤️❤️❤️
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Loved a lot
Anybody in 2023?
wow sir
Better then... Ap dhillon- with you..... Sang hoon tere.. . ❤the voice, the music, the beats, the lyrics..... Best song. Most of the romantic songs these days lack the touch/depth/essence....but this song is full of it..❤❤❤❤❤
I remember watching it 5yrs ago it was so beautiful. Watching it after years now and it still gives me same vibe as before.
bro how the hell you can make such great songs, you are literally gifted by god with all sorts of talent....btw this song makes me cry every time I listen to it
I&#39;m miss the old bb song..🥺
Don&#39;t know how many flashbacks hit everytime i listen to this song..... <br>Had been on my lowest when someone dedicated this song to me nd i used to feel each nd every line of this, which used to give me power in my struggling days.. Now guess what, life&#39;s sorted nd my &quot;sang hoon tere&quot; person is not in  my life anymore........ Still thankful to him for everything, stay blessed❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤

♥♥♥♥
I lost my girlfriend last week. It came as a shock. There were lots of things to say but i couldn&#39;t. I hope she&#39;s fine where ever she is. Maybe it was destiny, but I am sure we&#39;ll get enough time together to spend when I&#39;m gone. Until then, what i got is her memories which will stay forever.❤️
Starting is like Kaisi hai he ye rut ki jisme...song!

I can&#39;t believe ki log avi v isse sunne aate hain...mera fav tha 2018 janurary mein
The best song and video I have ever seen. Really Yaar bhuvan sir is so talented what a emotional story any one would cry seeing this and what a voice he is a singer + comedian. Trust I thought he is just giving bad words in his video but when I started seeing his video there was a lot of fun and lesson to be learned. And all the songs and video&#39;s just fabulous.👍👍🤘🤘🔥🔥💯
We are lucky that YouTube has gifted us BB
😍❣️
Song is better than any rap artist..✨💛
😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ohhhh yeahhhhhh
me abhi tak isko sun raha hun
I like darshan raval voice and your voice
You made me cry, soo emotional
Beautiful song, so touching
Bb😘
Me to the dislikers: kaun hai ye log kaha se aate hain ye ?      By the way great aong bhuvan sir😊😊
Bro we all want to see u in bollywood ad singer,actor,lyricist and etc.

Johnny Depp ki yaad aa jati hai tumhe dekhke
@bb ki vines, please upload a guitar version of this song. You sang some of  it with only guitar in a pinkvilla video. That was awesome.<br><br>So please.........  <br><br>Love always 💛

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RPuAW7E-YQ&amp;t=180">3:00</a> If you don’t understand y he is playing Guitar at a Restaurant it’s because before he started YouTube he used to play Guitar as a professional at Pubs and Concerts
I really feel that we have got BB as a gift in disguise for our generation. I say so because there are so many YouTube content creator who came into this field by looking upon him and his work. Truly a blessed and unique person. May God bless you abundantly and there is no word to describe the beauty of this song.
❤❤❤

Amazing song 👌👌
One Day I want to meet Bhuvan Baam
Doesn&#39;t this song has a vibe movie &quot;Dil chahta hai&quot; song &quot; kaisi hai yeh Rut ki jis mei&quot;...
I just got to know about his parents, <br>Having been living without parents i know how it feels like.. My heart goes to him.. I feel like maybe i could do something for him,make him feel good or something as a gesture. <br>This feels like a personal loss to me as well. May God give him more strength and more success. 💝

Things brings a wave of nostalgia: secretly listening to this song under a blanket, with headphones and no lights. Pretending to be asleep, with a loud smile on my face, knowing I have to go to school the next morning. Bhuvan will always be the one thing my generation was gifted.

Why is this song so underrated...One of the best 😭❤️
Main apne 1.5gb ka 1gb roz bhuvan sir k purane songs nd old video dakhke khatam kharta hu..want to meet this guy atleast 1time before my death
Loved the song.😍
For the first time, I had to think so much before typing a comment...<br>everyone has talent, believe me, everyone has brains, only doing justice to same and keep believing in yourself will get you to taste the success or some ratio of success. I am so happy for BB insane lady and Carry too and so many great you tubers who work so hard so hard that so many people may not realize, that without nepotism which runs in all industries they made it big. I am also watching BB interview on film companion while listening to the song and lyrics carefully of this song, all you youtubers, even BBK who expressed his graph going slow, should never never never think negative and get worried about loosing your subs or likes to competitors, competition is good that gets the best out of you and improvise you. And you people have achieved a lot i mean insanely lot, so many peole love, aur kya chahiye yaar to die in peace
Sab theak tha srip tal se tal nihe mila
Watching this song in 2021 as well bhuvan i dnt knw why, but there is something u got in to yourself yaar i like many celebrities but never felt to meet them, but dnt knw y i wanna meet u once in my lifetime..........
Axxe logo ke saath hee aisa kyuu hota hn😭😖🥺😭may soul of his maa nd papa rest in peace ❤️
To my Lovely wife 💜

Kankar ko 100 million <br>Aur talanted bhuvan bhai ke liye bas 20 million that&#39;s not good. He deservers 100 million i think <br>How many of you agree
