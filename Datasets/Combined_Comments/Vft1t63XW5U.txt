UFO does not stand for ”Aliens” it stands for Unidentified Flying Object which the publisher can clearly use because he or she didn’t know what it was.

Moby Dick, or a airship. Lol
Huntington Beach old stomping grounds. Only miss the beach.
What I hate about this video is you hear someone mention rockets in the background, and they still took the initiative to title it a UFO.

UFOs – transports from hell - UFO&#39;s - transports from hell. For the time has come when the most astonishing wonders will take place on the earth and in the air. . . .  [Satan] will have great power over nature.” Our Lady to the seers at LaSalette, France in 1846. False miracles“Already satan is working his way into your consciousness, seeking to take over your minds. He is now promoting false miracles. Those you call flying saucers are images from hell. My children, if you reject the knowledge of the supernatural, you are now playing right into his hands.”<br>Our Lady, June 18, 1978 In this final battle, there are many agents of hell loosed upon earth. They are traveling in transports. Do not be won over to a false theory of life beyond the heavens, other than the Kingdom of God. Know that it is satan who sends these vehicles before you. They are to confuse and confound you. These objects that take flight across your earth are from hell. They are only the false miracles of your times. Recognize them, My children; they are not a figment of man’s imagination. They are present in your atmosphere, and they will become more dominant as the fight goes on for the souls.<br><br>     “There have been divisions of armies set up, two groupings. Lucifer, Luciel, despicable creature of the darkness, has set himself to destroy man, man’s soul, and take them to the abyss, the souls of My children. When you fall, you will have fallen of your own free will. No man enters hell unless he has given himself freely to satan.”<br><br>     Veronica - Now I see ... oh, I see—it’s like a large hole. I see the ground is opening and people, people are just falling, they’re floating down into a very deep hole. But they seem to have no weight. They’re unable to control their movements, and they’re just hitting each other, and there’s terror on their faces. And they’re going down. There’s a great, tremendous, flaming light.<br><br>     And also now coming up are horrible creatures. Now—oh, and they’re screaming in terror, the people; but their bodies now are glowing like, like orange, like they’re afire, like glowing coals. Oh! Oh, and these other things that—they look like half animal and half human—they’re also placing their clawlike hands and pushing onto the figures, the human beings; they’re pushing them and they’re tormenting them. And their very faces are so horrible. But they are—they look—they’re so horrible and ugly, that they look like they’re enjoying the tormenting of the poor souls. Oh!<br><br>     Now these bodies of these lost souls—they seem to have an endless burning, like live coals. And they’re looking upward, and it’s a desperate—they’re trying to go up, up, out of the hole. But the more they fight to go up, the further down they go—down into the pit. Oh!<br><br>     Now I see many down at the bottom of this pit, and they’re sitting there. They’re no longer floating. The others must be new ones coming down. And those that are sitting are sitting in dejection, and they’re repeating: “Forever lost! Forever lost!” Oh! Oh! [Veronica moans at the sorrowful sight.]<br><br>     Now it’s growing dark. And now the light is coming out in the sky. Oh, it’s Our Lady. Oh, now Our Lady has removed the black covering from Her head. She looks very beautiful. She’s dressed all in white with a gold trim. And I see now that She has a golden—not a necklace, but a clasp about Her, and it’s tied into a knot. The knot has some circles in it, like—looks like three circles, three golden circles.<br><br>     Now Our Lady is holding up Her hand, and She has Her Rosary in Her hand. It’s a very large Rosary—has very large beads, and the Our Father’s golden. And Our Lady says:<br><br>     Our Lady - “You will tell your beads, My child, constantly. A constant vigilance of prayer throughout your country and the world is now necessary.”<br><br>     Veronica - And now Our Lady is raising Her Rosary like this, with the crucifix, and She’s making the sign of the cross, like this: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.<a href="http://www.tldm.org/Bayside/">http://www.tldm.org/Bayside/</a><br><a href="http://www.catholicplanet.com/apparitions/false08.htm">http://www.catholicplanet.com/apparitions/false08.htm</a><br><a href="http://www.smwa.org/hst/HST_007/HST_7_UFOs.htm">http://www.smwa.org/hst/HST_007/HST_7_UFOs.htm</a><br><br>Discerning the Devil&#39;s - <a href="https://ocistec-purgatory.weebly.com/discerning-the-devils.html">https://ocistec-purgatory.weebly.com/discerning-the-devils.html</a><br><br>..
Space x fan boys funny as! Why the US government gave Elon billions to start telsa motors, And they think it&#39;s all private. Do ya homework instead of just stucking up what space x tell you and Forbes.
Its a Falcon 9 launched my SpaceX you lollipop.
Probably the new SR-72 Aurora plane or some kind of SpaceX rocket.
Its Project Blue Beam...... Fake alien invasion, will be and seem so really but not true. Those chem trails aren&#39;t to so much kill us off at all..... but to make that canvas/that net/board like a tv needs, so this is their second <a href="http://test.watch/">test.Watch</a> this.... happened ages ago <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU9SzCnutes......">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU9SzCnutes......</a>. plus many more see, hear and use your heart in the Lord Jesus Christ
Nice video Ken. Falcon 9 launch from Vandenberg. You even got the stage 1 rocket doing its spiral burn back to base. It amazing they can reuse the 1 st stage by landing it back at the base after takeoff.
ITS A ROCKET NOT A UFO (reminder)
It&#39;s a flying sperm
Looks like a comet...
EITHE GOD JUST BUSTED A NUT OR KIM JUN OUH IS PUSHING HIS LINE
Saw the launch from Fresno! What a trip!
IT&#39;S GOKU!!!!!
I believe iz a UFO do not judge me people have sooo much they didn&#39;t explore
Santa?
Top ten Anime characters caught on camera.
SpaceX launch
I like how despite being handed an answer with a crap of of recorded proof, people in the comments still think this was an alien ship rather than a human rocket.
CERN
What the hell was that?
Это не это нло а камета
grerat video,i love UFO!
thats a meteor entering passing by close enough to scrape earths atmosphere. Its pretty cool but nothing to worry about,,,,,the size of that thing is probably about as big as two texas states put together......
Very similar to a rocket launch in Florida. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fvc3yWBrLU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fvc3yWBrLU</a>
&quot;Test launch&quot;?  This was an actual mission.  Not a test.

Aliens after your shaving supplies.<br><br>One man and his DE Razors vs the Alien menace
Lol one of my girlfriends was snapchatting that!
You should put a space man came travelling by chris de burgh music over the video, merry Christmas to you and the family Ken, hope the weather&#39;s better there than it is in Yorkshire 🌧
Tht was me I’m an alien <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23exposed">#exposed</a> lol 😂
Very suspicious because according to FAA it’s illegal to test Rockets in the city they can only be tested in the desert. So if our Zionist controlled media says it’s a Rocket then it’s not lol because they are full of crap. Also please do your own research about the so called Israeli art students during 9/11 and the USS liberty attack by the Israeli Air Force
Oh crap it&#39;s Santa
SPERM KARDEŞ DÜNYAYI DÖLLEMEYE GELMİŞ.

Its the spacex second stage of the falcon 9
Now I&#39;m in the mood to watch Mars Attacks 👽
<b>DO NOT WORRY! It&#39;s not a UFO, or missile/weapon, quite the opposite actually.</b><br><br>It&#39;s called a Falcon 9, and it was launched by SpaceX ( <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">http://www.spacex.com/</a> ) with 10 Iridium NEXT satellites. You can watch the entire livestream of the launch of the rocket on the SpaceX you tube channel. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtdjCwo6d3Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtdjCwo6d3Q</a><br><br>SpaceX is a private company owned by billionaire Elon Musk, founder of Tesla Motors and co-founder of Paypal. It is the first private company to land an orbital-class booster on a landing pad, so basically they send rockets up and land them again using the engines.<br><br><b>Explanation</b><br>The cloud tail you can see is the exhaust from the first stage, and the giant plume is the exhaust from the second stage being deflected off first stage. That&#39;s all it is, exhaust, and the bright dots are the two pieces of the rocket separating, letting one piece fly into orbit.<br><br>If people are kind enough, please upvote this so others can see.
Saw it right from downtown San Diego...looked pretty cool
Something similar was spotted over Phoenix too Ken.
Is not a UFO 🛸 looks like a leaking fuel tank or something
Y&#39;all not smart its just me 👽 paul chilling around
Good evening Ken! Now, that is so cool looking! Having said that, this appears to me to be similar to a ICBM test launch or space vehicle launch. Merry Christmas.
No UFO Ken. It is ELON MUSK with SpaceX flying one of his rockets from Vandenberg AFB
Woooww. There&#39;s so many people posting Instagrams of this too. It&#39;s super bright in the front like something is pushing the air out in front of it.
SpaceX test launch.
