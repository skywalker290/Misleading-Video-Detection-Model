Worst film of this planet
Spent a lot on star kids, set, clothes, jewellery. Consider to spend some on story line as well, then might cause less headache.
Happy birthday Madhuri Dixit Nene
Congratulations for 4 years of Kalank
🥲
Happy birthday Aditya Roy Kapoor
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=115">1:55</a> Arijit Singh 💖 goosebump 🤩

Agar ye trailer abhi launch hota toh pakka sadak 2 ka double record todhta <br><br><br>Dislike me 🤣
Ayushman khurana,Raj kumar Rao,Devendu sharma,others talented guy should get opportunity in Bollywood for Big budget,ignore Star kids, Otherwise Bollywood industry will be destroyed
Varia 😘
Someone just give Mr. Karan Kumar Johar a reality check,launch star kids I don&#39;t give a single fuck but make sure that you don&#39;t destroy the lives of upcoming self-made actors while you do it. Bollywood is a whole new world and you don&#39;t get to rule it ,you&#39;re just a fucked up gay producer who thinks he&#39;s the king
Best acting all  character master pice movie
Pls
Update full series
Good morning public all I need to watch this series
Thank you<br>Very nice
Fan of Adito.
Amazing year
I see this film it&#39;s windfall i give him 10/10  but the end is not good
First of all.....<br>Thanks for subtitless......
Hollywood could make realistic looking dinosaurs 26years ago but they could make a realistic looking bull in 2019 with 150 crore budget. 🤦‍♀️ But the grandeur and opulent sets are breathtaking.
Best
Name ki Tara film b kalank he hai
Bakwas movie hai
Nice
I actually love this movie
Bekar film
Oo
Owsm 😘
People after watching trailer : epic awesome excited to see it <br>People after watching movie : what a piece of shit was that Bollywood never gonna be good
Itni badi film......<br>Lekin sirf 1+ M views....🙄😀
Modi establisment is sponsoring to these kind of scripts, which degrade Muslims and ISLAMIC civilization, fact of the matter is HERA MANDIES was ESTABLISHED  by Ranjeet Singh who was a DAKKO of the Gujranwala, and SINING AND DANCING is HINDU CULTURE, In Islamic there is STONE TO DEATH PUNISHMENT   for  people who runs brothels or commit adultery , Muslims women are strongly order to cover themseleve from head to tow, like Hijab , there is no way  any Muslims can be allowed to drink wine or commit adultery under Islamic SHARIA LAW,  all these kind of Movies are propaganda of  Modi&#39;e establishment to degrade Muslims and Muslim Cultrue,
Finally the Rumors are true...This movie promotes Love jihaad...
trailer is beautiful superrrr❤️😘😍
Kya koi kalank movie dekhna chahta hai. Mere channel par. Agar chahte ho toh like kro. Agar 100 se upar ho gaye toh movie upload karunga
Kalank abhi kaha lgi hn??plz jaldi reply de??🙏🙏
Superhir tha movie ka trailer

Ek or tatti movie<br>Hd h bollywood
Movie upload karo na koi
totally the movie is of full of bull shit the only pillar on which its still standjng is arijit singh each nd <br>every single moment he proved that without his contribution nd obviously shreya ghoshal&#39;s ghe film is rubbish( ek ka biwi bolta hai dustri aurat se shadi karo aur jo dusri biwi woh ek affair karta aur jiske sath wo affair karta hai uska maa ke sathe pehle wale ladke ka bap ka affair rehta aur woo lady purane pyaar ke liye conspiracy karta aur beh*nc*od ye dekh ke sala ladkiyaan roh rahin rahe...) * dont want anymore kalank on bollywood
Dharma productions should hire movie experts from Hollywood to make big movies.... this movie is shit basically
Bakwas tareen movie. Karan you are a flop director and a flop producer. Your dad was good and u will never take his place. You are just a wanna be English person.
It seems there is competition between Thugs of Hindostan and Kalank which one is worst film?AdityaCand KaranJ are definitely chaddibuddies.Sirs script script script please
Agar movie mai alia nahi hota to ajj cinema wale ko mardeta hats off too her performance movie ki story to 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕

Damn, this would be good with Shahrukh or Hrithik, the settings &amp; vibe is cool, but the actors are just below average.
Without Srk Karan johar nothing
it&#39;s copy or similar as movie laal pathaar (1972)
Sirf 1 million views film bhi chutiyape waali lagrahi hai 🙄
Very bhansaliesque
Alia aditya varun madhuri mam sanjay sir It was brilliant trailer best of luck for movie
Can&#39;t wait for dis!!😘😘😘😍😍
90% of the comments are about Aditya.. 😉..nailed it 😍
Adity roy waiting
I m waiting this movie for sanjy dutt...super hero in Bollywood
i saw Kunal khemoo&#39;s one scene but very intense and strong!! his name is not appeared anywhere...sheer unfair
Bc...love jihaad dikha rhe h ye Bollywood wale
Aditya Roy Kapoor and kunal khemu to be the take aways!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=116">1:56</a>,the best scene
Where in India does this take place? Is aditya kapoor married to sonakshi in the movie and then takes a 2nd wife.
Mjy trailer full bakwas laga ha dekh lena movie flop hogi
Varun shouldn&#39;t be in the movie.
Mind blowing Super hit
Last train scene amazing pore trailor me ye scene dil ko lagi 💘
Woww
kalank nahi , yeh kanjar khana hai , karan Johar GAY  ki paidaysh.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=9">0:09</a> Alia looks so beautiful.
So the movie is basically aditya gets married second time to alia after sonakshi for some reason..and alia falls in love with varun..seems like they gave out the ending in this trailer where aditya is uniting varun and alia
Excellent all characters so fit in their so tough roles...Big movie...wonderful story of love and pain but lot of gain....Aliay, Madhurii G., Sonaskshi, Varun, and great Sanjay Dutt....super hero and heroines .
who else is only watching for aditya
sanjay baba 👍🏻
Im ONLY watching it for the legendary, Queen, Madhuri.
Aditiya Roy Kapoor&#39;s acting skills are on another level. He&#39;s the best in the whole trailer 😭🔥🔥
Best scene from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=110">1:50</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=120">2:00</a> ! The train scene, oh my goddd! Goosebumps everywhereee! Adityaaa 😍😩 and arijt too! ❤️

I still can&#39;t figure out what kind of movie is this?....A fiction film? drama or musical? looks dope tho....<br>I will watch it anyway for Aditya 😁
Supeerrbbb
Varun Dhawan ... One of the most overrated actors in bollywood
Tajmahal Of Nepotism...
&quot;Naajaiz Muhabbat ka Anjaam aksar Tbahiii hota hai.<br><br>Whole story stands on this dialogue.&quot;<br>Phenomenal line
Last train scene heart touch 💓😏
Varun acting is same in every movie 😕
Another karan masterpiece after a very very long time
I think Sonakshi has some serious disease in this movie.. Maybe that&#39;s  why she wants to find someone for Aditiya,  before she dies..  In the train scene Aditiya,Varun and Alia is there but Sonakshi is not there.. So maybe she was already dead...
aditya roy kapoor is fab<br><br>what a scene in end of trailer <br>its amazing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=114">1:54</a> 😂😂vfx fail

Aditya ,varun and alia😍😍😍
Dunia barbad h pyaar me bc 😂😂😂😂 hattttt chutiyapa bc
Nice cinematography experience. But not a nice story i think :/
who else thinks deepika should be in this movie
Arijit and aditiya the epic combo. Dont forget &quot;kyun ke tum he ho&quot; was hit because of both.. ❤❤
The last part of the trailer is a rip off of DDLJ
Come-back of Aditya Roy Kapoor 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
flop  Movie is out of touch.  The audience has changed.
Kamaalka trailer hai
typical love triangle...in a different way though...hope it has a story...
Flop movies hai ye ap es ki kahani read kar ke dekhe <br>Mujhe lagta hai ye movies lagt bhi nahi nikal payegi    ye movies lagbhag 30cr tak hi raha jayegi

Just a bogus story and bogus film
Why did I bawl??? Its gonna be a box office smash!!!!
Alia not only have beautiful looks but also showing acting skills after raazi.
Oh kunal khemu😍
Song is very well but i think this movie is flop
Alia , Vaurn nd adi bhaiii &amp; Madhuri mam. Just stele the show man. Awesome.trailer man ...  Surely gonna supershit. Nxt srk bhaiii nd kajol  mam. (V.D BHAIII &amp; ALIA MAM)
after watching it seems like Aliya is the centered character🤔🤔🤔
yeh movie bakwas hai
Karan ne bahut koshish ki Apne fevourite Varun Ko main lead role me rakhne ke liye.poster me bhi use centre me rkha.par Aaditya Roy Kapoor ke zabardast come back ne Pani fer diya.kyunki pure trailer me whi chhay hue hain aur shayd unhi ke liye log kai Baar repeat dekh rhe

Wow 😮
Kunal khemu role is too different and better than in other movies..
Who&#39;s come to see the VFX error 😄
Wow <br>amazing 😍
Wow
I sort of like the concept of the story of this movie.... But, I think the audience won&#39;t like it.... We are bored of love stories... My prediction is that this movie is going to be a flop
I had a tear in my eye...at the end...when he holds , and she wanna leave ..<br>All I wanted was... Varun to catch her. <br><br>Roop ki mohabbat   Mera haq h aur ye haq Mai le k rhuga. ..
osm trailer
Flop
Beautiful graphics
trailer looks very similar to upcoming Pakistani film The legend of maula jutt mahira khan fawad khan anyway this film looks very interesting and different story
I can’t handle this intense depth love story
Bund mrao fudideyo. Nikkami film
The last scene...😍😍😍
Love only sunju <br>😍😍😍
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=115">1:55</a> Alia&#39;s hand😂😂
This movie will be a megablockbuster
Esab movie love jehad ko barhaba Dene k liye hota he
I think the four directors competes with S .Rajamòlli ..<br>But brilliant work ,our support is  for such creation not for Race 3 ,and zero type movies .
Kalank nii ishq h kajal piya Nice trailer ☺☺
Boring movie
Omg amazing
Another Love jehadi propaganda film from the horribly mediocre  bollywood
Waiting to be released
Last train scene superb ✌☺
Kahani kafi acchi hai
Devdas 2 Bana Diya kya.......hitttttt...hai
Last scene was too good
who is the biggest fan of  alia and varun jodi 💑
I loved how Aditya Roy Kapoor saved Alia from falling in the end clip
My question is if Aditya’s character loves Sonaski’s then why is he suddenly showing interest to Alia?
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Super duper Flops sorry yaar flops sai bhee badthar
Flops
Soonaa ajyega theater main bakwas picture
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Super duper biggest biggest biggest flops
Kalank nahi ISHQ hai...! 😍😘
Total chutiyapa
Bakwas
Oh bc wow
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=110">1:50</a> ddlj again😂😂😂
Wow... Amazing ...the film will be awesome
So this movie is going to be love between Hindu and Muslim..i guess Partition scene in last.. Epic
Looks like fancy dress competition... I don&#39;t think Indians dressed like this in any era... Especially not in the pre independence era as shown here...  Looks like k3g
Confused
Please dubbed this movie in telugu
aditya is best
Is saaal ki sabsey behuda movie hogi which will earn crores. <br>Likh k lelo bhehenchodo.
How many of u think this film will be a flop!!!!
arijit singh and aaditya are just amazing
bhai ye konse zamane ka hai
aditya fans  kaha ho like karo 👍
Wow
Roop and zafar ! Stole my heart . Sahi mein kalank nhi ishq h .....
The stupidity in the train of DDLJ is back in Kalank 😑
Thank you for the subtitles! Looking forward to this move!!
All the best of KALANk .  Bollywood thumb up . Is saal ki sab se badi Hit hone wali hai Ye Film.  Kuch Naya sa hai.  Is film K waiting list me kon kon hai like karo
another extra marital research of Karan! are koi intense Kahani par kaam Kro yr... n stop copying bhnsali way of screenplay..
Who knows what is the story of kalank?
Who got the feel of padmavat?
Bekar ha
Last scene was epic man
Luv u aaditya 😍
Kya movie hogi i want watch this movie any how..superb trailor
Baba the great
best of luck Aliya diii
Madhuri and sanjay in a movie again😯😯😯
Aksar tbai hota h.
I&#39;m here for only Aditya Roy Kapoor and Sonakshi sinha!<br><br>Varun Dhavan on the other hand might ruin this film! <br>Directors should have casted an other actor 😞
Bokwas
Kalank nahi ishq hai kajal piya
Bakwas
A Threesome drama....
varun😍 u beauty.
Boring !!!
Again creepy bollywood secular Hindu (woman) muslim (boy) love story?<br>I don&#39;t understand why always muslim boy? Why not even cristian or sikh boy?<br>The way bollywood promote islam, Never going to watch this
Only for ADITYAROYKAPOOR AND ARIJIT SINGH
Waiting full movie
Alia will reject Varun Dhawan in the end by rejecting his hand and going inside train to Aditya Roy Kapoor
Kya bakwasss chutiya movie hai bakwas tralier no sense
The ending thoughhh BESTT
You couldn&#39;t stop yourself from putting a DDLJ reference. Could you? <br>Also why should every drama have an affair as a plot device. It&#39;s boring. We&#39;ve seen that a hundred times. <br><br>Portraying Muslims as this womanizer/seducer in the name of LOVE is just boosting  islamophobia from Aditya&#39;s perspective and Hinduphobia from Alia&#39;s. It&#39;s not cool. Mah boy Varun has to face tough life because.... Reasons?  Same thing with Padmaavat. Remember that debacle? <br><br>You can&#39;t make good stories and promote hatred? The trailer is trash...  Clearly. I wonder how the movie&#39;s gonna be.
it will be a history of Bollywood
Cheenal Partition ke Waqt Hindustan ja rahi Train se utar kero Pakistani ban jaayegi... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23louvzuhad">#louvzuhad</a>
Movie superhit jayegi <br>Madhuri dixit<br>Sonakshi sina<br>Alia bhatt
Gak sabar nonton film ini
So, if you being hindu ,love muslim by converting into islam , then it is called love! If  It&#39;s opposite, then it is haram!
Last moment in trailer and Arijit&#39;s voice ..... 👌👌👍👍
Worthless
Chutyapa👻👻
Aditya roy kapur is best
osm
Please dub in tamil also
I love adi bz of last scenes 😍😍😍😘
Varun Dhawan ki overacting film Ko bigaad deti h
Superb...!!
Ready for another superhit of alia and varun ❤❤
Firse hindu Muslim love story wli bakchodii😑😑<br>This shows Bollywood is shit
Varun 😍😍
The last scene just hits my heart!!MAGICAL!!!😢😍😍
Who is waiting for endgame after Kalank?
I think this will be the best Varun&#39;s movie I&#39;ve ever seen!!
&quot;Kabhi alvida na kehna&quot;<br>Similar story<br>extra marital affairs<br>Wohi porani fazool story.<br>Kuch to new dikhao Bollywood<br>Karan johar rapit his old story again n again<br>Writers ko pesy ziyada do 🤣🤣
Sonakshi u r really a queen... If agree then hit like...🙏
वरुण धवन जबरदस्त अॅक्टिग बॉलिवुड का नया स्टार
Kon kon yeh ghattiya movie dekhna chahta hai? Mai to bilkul nahi dekhna chahti bcoz i&#39;m sure isme sirf hindu muslim ka loccha hai, or kuch dekhne layak hai nhi or bakwas love story😡
All the people talking about Aditya but iam not because varun my favourite actor and varun very handsome nice and beautiful
Yaar koi varun ki acting ko bhi to zabarzast bol do
Another love story on a bigger scale!😂
I am so excited the this movie. Aditya Roy kapoor is super talent. Love you all &lt;3&lt;3:-):-);-)
Pritam da ne phir churaya game of thrones ka music starting me 😂😂😂😂
Chutiya panti bhara pada hai...
Blockbuster movies i Love Aaliya bhatt
Karan johar ki film, Train ka scene, arjith aur shreya ki aawaj, aliya aur varun ki diwangi, film hit to honi hi hai 😍😍😍
bgm is copied from game of thrones.

Ye trial to poori story hi byan kr rha ha...kunal khemu and madhuri👌👌👌
That train scene literary gave me goosebumps
Aditya&#39;s will steal the show
so a slut&#39;s decision ruins everyones life...<br>where have i heard this before
E movie Pakka flop hogi.....
Wooow
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mes5Jia04BM">https://youtu.be/Mes5Jia04BM</a> if you’re a DJ snake fan, then do watch it.
I think varun sanjay dut ka nazayaz beta hai <br>Nd Aditya real son sanjay dut ka<br>Nd madhuri love interest of sanjay dut
everyone neglected Varun <br>praising Aditya Roy Kapoor  he deserves it <br>and  Arijit is  the reason of its hit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=93">1:33</a> kunal khemu? Why his name not mention in starcast!😕😕
I requested to Bollywood don&#39;t show Hindu Muslim marriage.. Nhi to kedarnath ka Jo haal huwaa whi hoga ye India hai Pakistan nhi
Did anyone get goosebumps in the end?
Kis kiss ne ending ka scene bar bar dekha ??
Saala once again  Hindu Muslim marriage...
Just going mad to see it.....<br>👌👌👌👌👌😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
jo desh itna bada hai jiski abadi itni hai uski film industry ak shahar me kaid hai ise bahar nikalo or dusre sahro tak le jao waha v kahaniya hai love triangle dekh ke thak chuka hu
It should be directed by Sanjay Leela bhansali
Aditya superb
Aditya best
Aditya rocks
Love you Sonakshi. So beautiful 😍

Yeh Varun Dhawan toh bhot harami dikhaya hai &quot;mujhe konsa nikah krna tha apse..&quot;😅😂😂
She could&#39;ve jumped off the train, it&#39;s moving so slowly.
bapre trailer ekdam khatarnak hy
We expected a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23varia">#VARIA</a> show but Adi roy kapur just stole the thunder !! Btw awesome BGM❤

Last seen was killing
Wow Arijit Singh voice 😍😍 movie is awesome 😍
मेरे को लगा के यह background music and score सुना सुना लगता है मुझे खुद पर २०% विश्वास था के म्यूजिक कॉपी है गेम्स ऑफ थ्रोंस और DC ki फ्लैश टीवी सीरीज की फिर मैंने इस मूवी का म्यूजिक डायरेक्टर कौन है वह सर्च किया पता चला की म्यूजिक डायरेक्टर mr. प्रीतम है यह देखते ही मुझे खुद पर 200% विश्वास हो गया कि यह जरूर कॉपी है 😂😂😂
The last scene😭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njHgNUWvCr8">https://youtu.be/njHgNUWvCr8</a> Watch this beautiful beautiful video
Flop movie.... don’t beat me please 😆😆
Kalank movie best dialogue Sanjay Dutt //Roop aur Dev ke shaadi se Dur Ho Safar Varna Anjaam Bura Hoga :: how did Sanjay Dutt&#39;s dialogue//.??????

I like alia but not in this movie.. she is not looking that gorgeous yet aditya looks amazed.. nice scene..
India Pakistan batvarey ki story hai kya ye??sheher jalana aur hindu log train mai chad k bhag jaana 🙄
last scene is so much beautiful with the song ,  alia , aditya , varun nailed it ...waiting to see the movie , love from Sri lanka
Super flop movie, sounds like shit 👎🏻👍🏻
Aditya is the best part in trailer😍😍😍😍 he looks so handsome dashing cutest royal...and his expression..mar hi daloge❤❤❤ n what a acting...and his chemistry with  alia as well as sona....is best
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDhJLrx30V8">https://youtu.be/BDhJLrx30V8</a>
The last scene stole my heart !
Why Bollywood never make movies with content.always the same old love stories...<br>Totally disappointed 😑
Kunal khemu role...just wow..better than varun
Aditya&#39;s expression at the train scene is the best. You can see the love in his eyes.
Aditya look like royal prince😍😍😍 how cute he is... love you so much adi...I am falling in love with you❤❤
Aditya&#39;s performance is too good.but adi ka koi to song hona na is movie me
एक और💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
i am very very excited
Dilogha joredaar film rawan antha khatam karaneka kalank ki kahani action haii film dekhaneka baad pata chalega kone kisaka kalank haii kisaki  ki kahani haii
hello!
Got goosebumps...cant wait <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kalank">#kalank</a>
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=99">1:39</a> I think she was kriti
Reminds me of Devdas and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam
Omg varun u rock
Zafar and Roop!!!  Kalank Nahi.. Ishq Hai!!!!!!!!!!!  they fell in love and way their lives are. Its not wrong.  (its just the labels)<br>Varun and Alia have so much chemistry. Cant wait to see them again on screen together
This movie is a kalank on bollywood 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=90">1:30</a> agar PUBG mobile India Mai ban Ho gayi na to.... 🌋🌋🌋😁
Cello piece looks inspired from GOT
Movie super hit
Ark expression yr...isne to aasiqi ki yaad diladi
varun😍
Big flop coming soon!
Alia u r the best
Vahi purana ghisa pita train vala scean kab tak dikhaoge yar kuch to Naya le ao chutiyo.
So is Sonakshi Sinha pointless in the movie??”
alia and varun look amaaazing😍😍
Aditya Roy kapoor......Superb expression and background score of arijit
Hi- I dont mean to be a party pooper. But why have all recent films around the topic been solely around romance. The partition was an event that caused mass destruction and deaths. You do not see western cinema creating romance stories around the holocaust- and if they are, the movies are ignored. I would prefer, if for once, the partition can be seen from different perspective- i hope a new movie can be made that doesn&#39;t revolve around love. Otherwise I appreciate how beautiful this looks- taking nots from Sanjay Bhansali aren&#39;t we? :)
Kon kon is movie ka intezar kr rha h
Bollywood new movies uploads kyu nhi karte ho all new movies uploads kro please .<br>Cheat India<br>Jungle<br>Total dhamal hd me<br>URI<br>Kedaranath <br>Kashi search in Ganga <br>Kaala<br>Aur bhi hai sab uploads kro please bhai
Flop movie.
This looks amazing! And I haven&#39;t said that about a Desi movie in YEARS!!!!!
Why Bollywood does movie more in green room??? . This movie is trash!!! Bajrow mastani was epic deepika and ranveer 😍❤️❤️❤️ this is piece of shit by Karan
I think that alia meets varun and sona meets adi, sona and adi are married but alia gets trapped into marrying adi, sona is also ready to divorce adi. Adi loves sona but bc he&#39;s angry at himself he distances himself from Sona, bc he wants her to be happy. Madhuri and Sanjay also had a tragic past in which they avoid each other now. Sona eventually dies then in the train alia unites with varun finally.
Dialouges could have been better yar...jinna intense music hai unna vazan hi nhi pad rha
Sounds like Game of thrones music in the beginning 😆
Kunal khemu 👍
Ark is giving same expression from last few years
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj0CxEra-wQ">https://youtu.be/Xj0CxEra-wQ</a><br><br>Ye dekho kya ho gaya..<br><br>Assistant director ne kiya kalanke bawal
Yeh dubara kyun upload huaa hain?
So aditya is ajay devgund and varun is sallu
The actor who is living in the character -Aditya roy kapoor
At first I thought the ending of the trailer will be like the ending of DDLJ or Padmaavat.
साला जो मोवि मे भि लव जिहाद
Aditiya sonakchi beautiful couple
i wish if the director was sanjay leela banshali of this movie!
Everyone noticed Aditya over varun, cause he&#39;s looking superb🔥
Not so impressive trailer but it&#39;s a Karan johar movie with his favourite kids so definitely people will treat it like a Blockbuster and worth watching while the plot is looking very boring...!
Alrdy confused 🤷‍♂️
Its so sad to see sonakshi seeing her own husband getting married to somone else why does he leave such a beautiful women.
Madhuriiii
Chemistry of Aliya and Varun 😍😍
Varun and Alia best couple in movies💕
One word: complicated! <br>Let’s hope it lives up to the cast and hype...looking fwd to it. Aditya Roy is such an underrated actor.
I still remember the hype Created By the debut of Aditya Roy Kapoor in Ashiqui 2 .....<br>Everybody Was Drooling over The Deadly Combination of Arjit&#39;s voice and Aditya&#39;s Expressions. Reiterating This Kalank is Already a Hit 🔥💯
Now Please Don&#39;t fill this Comment section again with the name &#39;Arijit Singh&#39; 😂😂😂
Amazing
train scene was the ecstasy point...
Ek dam bakwaas movie hogi dekhne layak nahi ,biggest flop of the year, coz of floppest actor aditya and madhuri <b>RADDI</b> <b>BAKWAAS</b> <b>FLOP</b>
Aditya Roy Kapoor 💙💙💙💙
Aditya Roy kapoor my favourite actor. .I don&#39;t know y he has not done more films. .is movie me shradhha bhi honi chahiye thi. .beautiful pair. .Adishraddha. .my favourite
Kya hai yeh boring saa kuch samjhme hi nhi aarha hai
ARK ❤️
VARUN DHAWAN Overacting ki Dukaan
that train scene at the end is just 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bsdwalo bas teen char hero aur heroines ko leke threesome karo
no 1
Don&#39;t know why it gives me got vibe
The train scene was sooo epic, specially when Aditya saves Aliya😀😀😀
Kalank treller dekh ke lagta hai ki jab 17 April ko realise hogi to blockbuster hokar rahegi. Dharma production hitt like 👍👍👍
Aliaaaaa 😍😍<br>Looks kind of a royal n rajput type movie <br>Seems to have Lot of suspense n twist  <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23waiting">#waiting</a>
Why it&#39;s always a Hindu girl and a Muslim boy 😡😠 why not a Muslim girl and a Hindu boy
Aditya Roy Kapoor will steal the show..🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥<br>Take a bow aadi
I m waiting this movie watch.... Arijeet sir so nice... Voice
Kasam see kitni slow movie lag rahi hai<br>Na dailogue sahi hai<br>sirf bada set hone see movie hit nahi hoti<br>Siper hit hone k kiye 500 core hona hai yeh movie to 140 core k niche hi kamaiyegi<br>Aur flop
Na jaez mohabbat... Aksar barabdi deti ha ❤️<br>Par....<br>Mohabbat to hamesha barbad karti ha... Jaez ya na jaez...
Varun dawan😍
Varun and Alia evergreen couple
Wow 👌😊
Flop hai jyaada melow drama hai
Super super super excited for this movie ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Aliya ki acting❤️😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

The last scence man!😍
Awesome 😎
Proud of Aditya again.. ❤
Everyone is talking about Aditya , Varun , alia but let&#39;s not forget kunal khemu was looking dope and the intensity on that dialogue was awesome
Where is Salman Khan ! <br>Oops it&#39;s not PRDP 2 ?!?
Oh mannn....this film is gonna awesome
Hit like for Aditya&#39;s lastscene 💟💟💕
شوكت ينعرض هذه لفلم
awesome
Eagerly waiting.. I hope it should be A Blockbuster 🤗😍✌👍
Aditya Roy Kapoor will rock mark my words
Only aditya is worth watching.....  Baki sab bakwaas h.....
पूरा ट्रेलर ही कलंकित है। बकवास।
Ek hee cheez do baar do channel se nikaalne ka kya faayda?😑
Sanju welcome comback
Aditya + Arijit = Awesome 🔥
who noticed Kriti Sanon&#39;s item at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=100">1:40</a>?
After Aashique 2 he proves! ❤
Yaar I really liked the end scene, maybe it&#39;s going to be a love triangle
Aditya Roy Kapoor ❤️❤️❤️
Accha laga in the bracket hey sab kuch  .shaddi  ke baad extra marritial affair.hey asa log bolenge .per pyaar to hey . Jo sab rishte se uper hey.koye dharam pyaar ke aad nahi aur pyaar apne aap me ik dharam  hey.per iske matlab pyaar ke vaje se jo kuch hua  bura hua .vo hey kalank.sahi hey trailer movie dekhunga
I SO WISH it was Sonakshi in Aliya Bhatts role... Then all the scenes wud have made a much bigger impact... She is SO NOT WORTH all the blockbuster movies of dharma production... SO HAPPY TO SEE KUNAL KHEMU BACK... He deserves much more....
Did anyone noticed kunal khemmu?
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=93">1:33</a> Are koi Kunal Khemu ke liye bhi coment kardo yaar😉😉
Ddlj ka scene yaad aaya in last part with some twist 😂
This movie promotes Love Jihad..
Loved Aditya Roy Kapoor.. specifically The ending scene
I will go to Theater only to see the  aftermath of the last scene of the trailer .
Thank you for the English subtitles &lt;3 You made foreign fans of Indian movies really happy :) As a Polish girl I could only understand simple sentences such as &quot;I love my wife very much.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m married&quot; without subtitles. The trailer is really good. I can&#39;t wait to see this movie! The visuals are amazing! The last scene with a train reminded me of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. But I think here it won&#39;t end happily... Somehow I can feel the tragedy in the air... :(
only varun he is a batter than others
bakuwash trailer
Real feel noo language matter its trailer too tha full movie feel super trailer waiting for a movie it&#39;s tamilan
Arijit Singh + Aditya Roy Kapoor is a combo again . And at last the scene of train just awesome
Kabhi Alvida na kehna part2.😂😂
The new Kalyani jewellers ad looks amazing.
Great acting by aditya Roy kappor. What an acting sir. Hats off to you.
Typical Indian love story and movie 😄😄😄😄😄😄... ....ku6 to Naya dikhao
Aditya nailed his role !!! Was Bollywood sleeping all this time ? <br> He should get more opportunities. <br> Adi😍
I love varun and alia . I wish movie ke end me in dono ki jodi bne na ki aaditya and aaliya
Trying to copy Sanjay Leela Bhansali, thumbs down to karan johar!
Any malayalis???
KALANK NAHI ISHQ HAI ❤
Aditya Roy Kapoor such an underrated actor💯
Luv u varun dhawan
Finally the wait is over...
I shouldn&#39;t have watched this trailer..it almost reveals the whole plot! 😒😒..Kya stupidity Hain!
Be a great movie
Love jihad
Dilwale dulhania le jaayenge?
Sanjay leela bhansali movie+ karan johar movie = kalank..
Amazing trailer i love it.......bohat vadia bs film da wait aa
Is sona the first wife?
Last scene was much good when adhitya Roy protected her to fall from train and Aliya was trying to hold varun&#39;s hand with eagerly.
Wow,  all the best
Everyone talking about aditiya roy kapoor, this is insane, i mean his expression are awesome at the end ...
Flop u dog
Only fan of Varun dhawan...
Why they have uploaded again this trailer?
Last scene though.... Paisa wasool
Lgta h ab ke fir jalegii 😂😂😂
Varun
When this movie is releasing..??
Kya bakwas hai
Waiting for iiiit
Thooooo.... romba kanraaaviya irukku!!!!! 😝
In Bollywood if the character is muslim he should apply surma in his eyes or else he won&#39;t be identified.
KANK was much better... I mean Kabhi Alvida Na kehna!! I remember that time Nick name of that movie was KALANK and both movies are from Dharma productions!!
हिजड़ा ले आया एक और फ़िल्म जिसने सामाजिक सौहार्द को बिगाड़ना है।
aditya!!! Joss acting!
Good to see the Indian culture reformed again in nowadays movies in terms of dressing and choreography! Hats off to the directors.
Invest your money in something better then making triangle love story type sh**s
Incredible alia😍😘
Aditya n Kunal khemu 😍
<b>ANOTHER BOARING LOVE JIHAD STORY</b>
Another flop on it&#39;s way 😂😂
Its going to be a Super hit blockbuster Film
aditya roy kapoor is gonna still the show.........
uski iske pas iski uske pas..
boring trailer.....waste of time
Amazing!Last scene is fabulous with Arijit Singh&#39;s voice!👌😉🤓
really nice one...eagerly waiting for the movie.
Last cien is super
Omg Aditya&#39;s expression and arjit&#39;s voice♥️♥️♥️it&#39;s such a delight.
love from egypt
The lageng of Maula jutt ki look a rahi ha
Bakwas hai
I think Another flop movie😶😶🙄🙄🤨🤨
Big time flop
Last part was mind blowing...
Roop and dev jodi is best . I hope at last there love story will complete.
Varun and Arijit fans like here....I expect atleast 100 likes
cutiya hindu Muslim issue<br>Muslim as a hero , hindu as a villain<br>ghanta bollywood..
साला हर टाईम लडकी हिन्दू होती है n लडका मुस्लिम bc 🖕
Only excited to see Aditya and Kunal in good roles after a long time.
Aditya overshadowed everyone
कुछ फिल्में ऐसी भी बनाने की कोशिश करने चाहिए जिससे किसी का कोई भेद नहीं हो, सभी लोगों के लिए एक <b>स्वच्छ</b> संदेश दे सके!! हालाँकि ऐसे फिल्में बनते भी हैं पर बाकी उनसे ज्यादा है..
Dialogues are just fantastic , even many of us would be using also.
Kya Bawaseer bana diyee hO yee... Bakchodi ki bhi hadd hoti hai
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=115">01:55</a> when aditya holds her hand when she was about to fall... Man that scene was kind of touching. And arijit&#39;s voice made it 10x more intense<br><br>Waiting for this movie❤️🙌🏻
Trailer was underwhelming. People are going on about that last scene between ARK and Alia..not goosebumps inducing at all for me. But overall I&#39;m more interested in seeing ARK + Sonakshi&#39;s pairing. They both seem solid here.
Aditya superb
Game of thrones music
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23amazngggtrailer">#Amazngggtrailer</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23the">#the</a>_last_is_scene_is_just_phenomal✌😊
Sridavi were to be in this move. So sad
tried to copy bhansali theme..still love to bhansali sir..no nepotism
Kalank nehi ishq ki kajal piya..........<br><br>This line on Aditya Roy Kapoor and Alia Bhatt just killing me...
Rahul Gandhi  The Next PM of India <br>We Youths Are With You Rahul Sir <br>CONGRESS PARTY ZINDABAD
Love the visually appealing aspect...
Congress Party Zindabad<br>Rahul Gandhi Jindabad
Will be one of the best movies of 2019.
बॉलीवुड में चाहिए कि फिल्मों को <b>रोजगार</b> देने का जरिया न बने ( जैसे लगातार नये लोगों को काम देना ) इससे फिल्मों की गुणवत्ता में काफ़ी कमी आएगी!!
Aditya roy kapoor is so amazing. He is natural actor.He deserves more good movies.
Aditya roy kapoor amazing! No words
Too excited to watch  ...who else like n show ur excitement... 😍😘
Aditya kapoor and sonakshi sinha looking awsome together... 😍
Was she kriti senon at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=100">1:40</a> 🤔
Gussay me liye gay ek fansla <br>Is not a fansla it’s an over reaction which is what these characters are based on just like all of Bollywood. Who tf cares anymore
Pr team shitting like hell in comment section
Waiting to see Sunju baba in KGF chapter 2...KGF
Aditya Roy is looking different !
Very good alia keep it up
Damn that train part is lit🔥🔥🔥
I got goosebumps!! The concept is unique.. I think I&#39;m gonna watch it nd love it ❤
Nice
Alia Bhatt太漂亮了，虽然听不懂印度语也听不懂英语，但是一点不妨碍我喜欢印度电影喜欢Alia Bhatt 哈哈
Kunal khemu bhi hai movie mein
aadi very good
Karan copying SLB, i can bet this movie cannot do more than 185cr. 😏😏😏😏😏
फ़िल्म के <b>ग्राफिक्स</b> लोगों को लुभा रहे हैं!! हालाँकि <b>कहानी</b> में कुछ अंतर नहीं है, जैसे कि इस दौर के फिल्मों में होते हैं...
Damn... Can&#39;t wait for the movie like fr fr 😍
Ye to &quot;dil wale dulhaniya le jayenge&quot; ho gaya akheer mein 😂😂
Tabahi
I think it&#39;s like gadar movie
2 hours of depression
मुझे लगता है कि <b>बॉलीवुड</b> फिल्में <b>विदेशों</b> में ही नहीं बल्कि अपने देश में ही अपनी चमक खोती जा रही है !! अब इन लोगों के पास न तो अच्छे नाम और न ही अच्छी कहानी होती है !! ज्यादातर फिल्मों में लव-ट्रायंगल परोसा जा रहा है, ऐसा प्रतीत होता है कि ये किसी सुनियोजित दौर है...
I think big blockbuster movi hoga
1 number ki movie hone wali h boss
Arijit voice down everybody in this trailer
Aditya Roy Kapoor 😍😘❤
flop movie rahengi
They never learn.... Get inside the train through the nearest door
kis kis ko pasand aya
Alia ❤
Just missed Ranveer, Deepika and Sanjay Leela Bhansali
Outstanding trailer 😲😲🤔😲😲🤔😲😲
FLOP
Again d concept is on xtrA marital affairs...After marriage only dey fall in true love..
Once again! Varia is back , guys love you both and very much exited for &quot;Kalank&quot;
Did SLB possese Abhishek Verman?
Varun you best hero
last scence gave me gousbams
Varia😍😍
So nice i have nothing to say just woww
Awesome...wonderful..this type of movie should be made
Very pathetic 👎👎👎👎👊👊
This film should be make im direction of Sanjay Leela Bhansali
GOT ka background copy kiye hain
So many kalanks in one movie.
Super
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=90">1:30</a> Varun looks like Shahrukh here
Dialogues delivery just like Sanjay Bhansali films very poetic and dramatic
Want actor and actress for my first utube video!! U will pe paid ... Reply me

Aditya roy Kapoor u beauty!! If u will work like this ,u will beat every if and buts of acting!! In such a small glimpse i am impressed by ur acting... Great work
Indian movie me hamesha same story hoti ha try something different like Pakistani films br br ik hi story bored now yar stop it
Kya trailer hain osamm
I am so excited for this movie...
Aditya😀 Shona😍
This film will be a blend of Hum dil de chuke sanam and Devdas.<br>Larger than life sets, pretty faces, same old story with few twists here and there, dramatic dialogues, perfect costumes &amp; jewellery and goddamn music &amp; dance. that&#39;s it.. that&#39;s all it takes to make a blockbuster film and rob all the award shows.
Good nice
I was waiting for the title track from the beginning of the trailer .... And yeah it&#39;s there..... 😃😃😃
The main attraction of the trailer is the last part<br>Arijit Singh&#39;s voice and the chemistry between aditya and alia is just awesome 😍😍
Sajid nadiadwala shoeing love jihad and hindus clapping and whistling in cinema. <br>I bet and u all knoe that if a muslim <br>Girl was eith hindu l, a fatwa wud have been issued.
Such a waste of money done by dharma 😹😹😹😹
Ham dil de chuke sanam+padmavat+devdas+Bahubali= kalank..will definitely live upto its name.nothig new..doesnt look grand at all
Sale hindu aise hi har baar ye love jihad ki stories promote karte raho.<br>Pehle kedarnath ab ye <br>Bhenchod agar ye muslim ladki ki baat hoti to ab tak fatwa issue ho jata karan johar ki gardan ka.
One more film showing Hindu Muslim fight..... BTW all actors performance are best
Emotional attyachar.... Tharak se bharpur
Fav. Part kumal khemu...🙏🏼🙏🏼🤫🤫 super hit loaded...
Chutiya Movie
I&#39;m very excited 4 this movie 😘😗😀
For aditya roy kapoor&#39;s character,n bigness look of movie 👍
Anyone noticed that after kedarnath, again a LOVE JIHAD story. Why can&#39;t the roles be reversed ever.
I think you guys forgot KRUNAL KHEMU people only talks only about aditya aliaa😅...<br>But EAST OR WEST VARUN IS BEST...<br> I WANT VARUN AND AJAY DEVGN TOGETHER IN MOVIES HOPE SOMEONE MAKE THAT HAPPEN🤞
Another LOVE JIHAD story by shitty Bollywood.<br>This time married woman with a zafar. Why i say why couldn&#39;t the roles be reversed ever?? <br>Why this appeasement of minority is there?<br>Does karan johar fear that muslims may fuck his life if boy was hindu and girl muslim because it is clearly stated in islam that a girl can&#39;t marru a KAAFIR.<br>FUCK U BOLLYWOOD
Hamesa hindu ladki and muslim ladka. Sirf pak mai film release ho sake.kedaenath mai bhi yahi.shame bollywood.
kunal khemu is way more better then leads <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=91">1:31</a>
Why did he marry her if he loves his wife?
Aditya and arijit<br>Perfect together
Two Raj One Simran <br>DDLJ return
LOve jihad dekhao salo
Chutiya movie
Puri movie me starkids ko bhar rakha h
💟💟💟💟💟
I&#39;m looking forward for kunal&#39;s part. He&#39;s such a good actor 😊
Rank in order after watching the trailer.<br>1. Aditya (need no explanation why he is in top . he is rulling the comment section)<br>2. Kunal (one of the best performance of villain n justifying with his role)<br>3. Alia (her style her focus)<br>4. Sonakshi (she is the sweetest character good work)<br>5. Sanju (He is amazing)<br>6. Varun (makers just add to put glamour hunky desi style , acting skills we already saw in Badlapur and October)<br>7. Madhuri (just a big name old aged)
Dharma (Melodrama) Production 😀😀😁😋😋😀😀😀
Adi....Rockzz😍😍😍😍
Aditya ciraa veer 👌👌😍😘<br>Bhot hard bro

Najayaz muhabbat ka anjaam aksar tabahi hota hai

What da hell. Very limited screen space of sanjay baba and madhuri mam like zero time in trailer. Not fair at all. ByTheWay not a good trailer. 😥
Ddlj last scene... 😂
Aditya Roy Kapur ❤️❤️

Movie seems to be very nice and beautiful looking forward 😍😘
Sonakshi, aditya and madhuri stole the show for me ! ❤ this is called acting 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Karan johar ka movie hamesha love mashed up Hoga hai hi...haha
Pura movie antihindutva and HINDUPHOBIA pe Banaya Gaya hai
For the first  time i am shipping   ALIA AND ADITYA in a movie of which VARUN  is also a part of
Epic background music..<br>Loved it..💜
Flop hone wali h movie....kyuki 6 stars ek saath h...isiliye movie ka budget high ho Gaya h..and  budget se jyada nhi Kama payegi ye movie...this will be the disastrous for sure...🙄🙄 Pta nhi Karan johar ne Kya soch kr itne sare acctors liye h is movie Mai....
Arjit Singh voice 😍attract
Shitty old school gisi piti love stories. Why bollywood&#39;s  every second film is on love story they should know that today&#39;s generation is bored of such things they need new concepts based films . I must salute to films like kesri , uri , the Tashkent files, padman , parmanu , badla and the same categories films which are better then this gisi pitti same kind and always boring hindi love stories .
Ab drama prodation ne shah rukh ko chor k varun ko pakr lia h kb h relies
Where is sex scene
Picture hero heorine entry 30.00 min<br>Songs 30.00min<br>After tha story will run
Aditya Roy Kapoor 😍😍😍
1000 percent block buster hogee
Kis Kis ko lagta hai Kalank  super hit  hogi
I think they made things clearer in the trailer at a very large extent, when I saw the Train sequence, it seemed like it would be like DDLJ, but a sudden twist made all the difference, and increased the beauty of the scene. But still, the film should be way more than a love story. I like whole messed up relations in between the characters, I think that&#39;s the film about but it should be really surprising and extraoridinary to be called a Masterpiece, otherwise just simple bollywood love story type!
Kisi aur film ki bgm jaise lagtha hai...
Super hit
Varun&#39;s mind blowing performance .......
The last scene 😭😭😭
This going to be hit for century
Love it
Loved it yrrrr.... I don&#39;t know why I always get goosebumps when I listen this  music
Translation is here 😂❤❤❤
flim main 6 celebrity hai Lekin main  Arijit ka song pasand ker Raha hoon  ye  kalank hai...
I dont know why .. but Aditya seems excellent of all..wow
As always varun is going rock 💓💓💓💓
who started to saving money for  watch kalank😂
👌👌👌💞💞💞💞
Background music is too much can&#39;t hear proper dialogs
Train scene is touching
The last scene was just phenomenal💕🔥🔥🔥 I can&#39;t wait to see this film..All the very best Team <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kalank">#kalank</a> ❣
hit like for varun
Omg!! It&#39;s really going to be super hit movie of the year...<br>Loved it !! What a fine and beautiful plot with amazing actors &amp; their emotions..❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😘😘😘😘😘😘
Okay. <br><br>So here&#39;s a story of a happily married loved couple Sonakshi-Aditya but Sonakshi can&#39;t bear children so forces Aditya to marry Alia. Alia agrees but later realises it to be a mistake when she doesn&#39;t get the love of her husband. So she starts going out with Varun and they apparently have an extra marital affair. When Alia finally stops waiting for her husband and decide to elope with Varun, Aditya realises his feelings for her and stops her from going.<br><br> Sanjay Dutt is probably playing the father of Aditya Roy Kapoor and Madhuri must have been his mistress/ girlfriend from his youth life. <br><br><br>Here&#39;s story simplified. They basically gave everything away in the trailer. 😂
Wow Aditya Roy Kapur is gonna be awesome in this film. His expression was fabulous when he held Alia&#39;s hand at the train scene.
SOO EXCITED!!!! ADI AND ALIA TOGETHER😍😍❤️❤️
Wow trailer👌<br>Waiting for the movie...<br>Best wishes KALANK❤
लड़की हमेशा  हिन्दू ही क्यो दिखाते है ये bollywood वाले ओर आशिक़ हमेशा मुसलमान । इसी कारण बहोत ज्यादा  Love Jihaad का शिकार हो रही है लड़कियां<br>ईश्वर हिन्दू लड़कियों की रक्षा करे इस जिहादी Atmosphere से <br><br>जय हिन्द

Same bridge from saawariya 💝💝💝
Why would u distribute the trailor in two channels and the views also gets distributed ...fox star studio was enough for this
Anyone noticed all actors in this movie are Starkid..Nepotism on its height..Karan johar
Kalank
T series sucks
Nice trailer 👌
Wow such a beautiful movie I think this year also alia will only get the best actress award
Last seen was amazing.....
Aditya Alia 😍😍😍
Oh my God!!!! I can’t wait to watch it!!! Ahhh! So intense!!! <b>hyperventilating</b>
That moment when dady johar wants to promote his daughter and son but audience choose Adi s performance and Arijith s voice instead 😂

Another bollywood conspiracy to promote love jihad.<br>We should avoid watching these kinda films.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=113">1:53</a> this scene was so mesmerising and arijits voice 🔥🔥was magical enough to give goosebumps <br>Kudos to all especially arijit 👏👏

Aditya nailed with his stunning acting🔥
My word.. Arijit Singh rocks again. <br>But Aditya Roy Kapoor stole the show here..
I don&#39;t like this trailer, too much drama.
A.T.B. hogi ye  film
The last train scene was the highlight of the trailer. Not to forget  Aditya Roy Kapoor just nailed it.
Flop jaaegii 🤣
Hum dil de chuke ki xerox copy
varun ne surma lagaya hai hahahaha
Karan beta apni beti ko lena jarur h kya puri film ka naash krdya

Abey trailer kitni bhi baar release kar do tatti hai to tatti hi rahega.Icecream nahi banjayega.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=115">1:55</a> Advanced version of ddlj
Wo last scene dek ke mujhe lagtha hai ki movie super hit hai
movie is purely based on luv jihad, hindu girl and muslim boy why cant they reverse
Aditya👍👍👍✌✌👌👌👌👌
Would it cross 1000crore box office collection
A trailer just 6 seconds longer than it&#39;s teaser. OK, great!
I am writing 17 April
Hum jante the ye sale bollywood wale Hindu ladki or Muslim ladki ka pyar dikhayenge . <br><br>Fuck u bollywood salen madarchod..
Kab aaye ga
Best run up 2019 working like this only Karan Johar
That train scene......adi killed it...
very grateful movie ..<br>varun , Aliya aur adity ki acting ek dam no.1 h <br>kalank ka trailer ek dam mast h ..
Did Anyone Else Felt That Background Music Is Similar To GOT? ❤️
Aditya Roy kapoor&#39;s expressions of emotions is on another level😍🔥
I hope it wouldn&#39;t turn a movie with a superb trailer and a movie like crap
Anyone noticed kunal khemu?
&quot;Najayaz mohabbat ka anjam aksar tabahi hota hai&quot;<br>Not a good rule to live by.
kriti @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=99">1:39</a>😁
oye its was Kriti Sanon  in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=99">1:39</a>
Last seen in this video  is tell all about  .... kalank nahi ishq hai kajal piya💛💔😍🤗😀⚠✔
sala kuch samaj me nahi aa raha trailer me
Smart move dharma productions
They doing early release bcs next week avengers end game is coming up no body gonna watch this for sure in front of tht
Aditya roy kapoor kaa last wala scene kiskisko sabse jyaadaa pasand aaya <br>Comment like karo
Why same trailor again and again
Same old shit. Just have good vfx
Can clearly tell who&#39;s the nepotism products and who&#39;s the self made outsider from their acting
Triangular love story barun alia and siddarth between also Hindu and Muslim
just amazing..soulful voice arjit singh...luv from tamil nadu
I am here only for sona
Karan is trying to make Varun and Alia the next Shahrukh and Kajol but its never going to work
Omg Kriri Sanon is in the flim
But where is sanjay n madhuri&#39;s chemistry?
Avengers EndGame Like👍<br>Kalank Movies Comment<br>❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
varun dies? 😢
Arijit 😍😚
Fans hit like <br>Aditya roy kapoor 👊👊👊👊👍
Excited for this one
......And again a trash generated from dharma.
Last screen so good...
Saala yahi kab tak bollywood ek katuwa or ek hindu ladki madarchod ki maa behen kothe mai bikti hai to sochte pure mai yahi isi ko follow karna chahiye
aditya roy kapoor mind blowing
Why karan johar only works with particular fixed sets of actors like alia, varun, kunal roy kapoor etc etc. earlier it was sharukh. I have never seen him giving role to a rookie.
Arjit + Varun<br> Arjit + Aditya<br><br> One of the very rarest and deadliest combos...🔥🔥
<b>Finally there will be a content movie</b>
That shit bro , not hater just true review , first of all wrong character to play.
Alia ki acting kamaal ki hai aur talented Alia ki wajah se ye film pakka blockbuster hogi mein pray karoogi Love you my sweetheart aloooo
Aditya ... Perfect!!!!
This looks like a solid 6/10
I never expected Varun, alia and aditiya would be in a same movie and that too in this kind of movie I can&#39;t wait for KALANK I am so excited 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Ye to blockbuster movie h
serbu di bioskop Indonesia
200 carore india me kr legi...<br>Kon kon agree haine hit like
Best chemistry varun n aliya batt

Why Alia Bhatt out of the million awesome actresses Bollywood has to offer! I was really looking forward to a good drama, and now she just killed my interest. So annoyed.
Aditya roy kapoor is best actor

Full classic film , yrr
is this Kriti Sanon @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=99">1:39</a>  ?????
This soundtrack suits  so much more better than AR Rhamen&#39;s song for avengers infinity war. Who else agrees
Section 497 on Grand scale 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=110">1:50</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=119">1:59</a> Train and its scenario makes me believe that the story plot is based on partition time 1947 India&#39;s partition <br>Because appearance of the train and clothing style says it all
Adi looks fabulous😍😍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeCi8IKZ3Fg&amp;t=114">1:54</a> was the best part of the trailer.... Arjith Singh ♡
Superb movie

Alia bhatt is the puppet of karan johar
Wow another story of a hindu married women alia bhatt and muslim boy Varun <a href="http://dhawan.so/">dhawan.So</a> sexy.Hindu women muslim boy couple should be show in every movie.More and more films should be made on hindu girl muslim boy love story.Its so sexy to watch hindu women muslim boy love story.Its a kind of inner excitement cant tell.Hindu girl muslim boy always been a hot couple since 1000 yrs and its now common everywhere u can see hindu girl even married having affair eith muslim boy having sex marrying running wandering doing parties together
I don&#39;t know why I wanted Fawad Khan in place of Varun Dhawan in this movie?
