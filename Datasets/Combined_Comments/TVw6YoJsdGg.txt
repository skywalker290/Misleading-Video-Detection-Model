Would like to see what were the best aap ki adalat interviews
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think Bollywood feels that it is necessary to add 5-6 songs in a movie and thus, they add songs with weird lyrics and weird choreography, even though it makes no fricking SENSE!.
Honestly love these kind of vids
ABBG TPOG literally means ae bibiji tea ☕ piyo ji 😅😅 <br>and IPKI  UPOG  means I peeke aayi you peeyoji😂😂😂😂
How could even atamaram bhide even say “ hamare zamane ke Gaano me kuch meaning hota ta tha “ when unke zamane ke gaane ese the.
To be very honest, Kal saiyaan gives headache
Hahhahaha

I m in a love with ur voice 💓

My God the last couldn&#39;t control laughing first time hearing this kind of stupid song.
Why can&#39;t you add some subtitles so that non Hindi people can understand what is wrong with the song?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Taraaju was not a successfull film .it was a Big disaster at the box office .the film was amongst the slew of box office flops which Akshay did between 1997 and 1999.
Seriously.. I didn&#39;t even know these songs exist on earth 😂
Kuuuuuuuuuuuchhhh bhiiii ❤️❤️😂

Instead of reading lyrics play the song cuz you reading the lyrics makes it more cringe worthy
I love your voice!!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVw6YoJsdGg&amp;t=216">03:36</a> that&#39;s my reaction to most of these, uh, lyrics

What is the intro music.. give me name
Your content is soooo good:):) There was one song featuring Akshay Kumar &quot; Jab Tak Rahega Samose main Alu  deta rahunga aoo Meri Shalu &quot; of the movie Mr and Mrs Khiladi... it took away my faith from the lyrics of 90s movie songs

Make a video and share your thoughts on the trend nowadays that has been spreading across India like cancer, and we all know that how it started....some actress makes a comeback into the bollywood spotlight and accuses a well respected actor known for his philanthropic work, for no reason
Song play krte toh maja aate ....aise gaa rahe jaise reading newspaper irritating
What???
I was cringing throughout the video.
the list can go up to 100
Dont give reviews if u can&#39;t show the song we don&#39;t see videos to hear your voice only

Wat a voice😊
No. 1 literally No. 1
Your voice ❤
&quot;Susu agaya re.<br>Ja jhadi ke piche karke aa.&quot;
For gods sake please, please include more and longer video clips. Not just commentary. I don’t think there will be any copyright issues. And others do it without any issue. You’ll get more subs and the subject matter is spot on. The videos itself speak for themselves.
I don&#39;t know whether to be proud or ashamed that I immidiately recognised the song featured in the thumbnail... xD I mean, it was certainly - - memorable...?
Dude where the hell is khada hai khada hai khada hai
What about Swag se karenge sabka swagat 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Sach mein brain cells fry ho gaye.....
Tandoori nights was awful aswell
Whenever I watch a TRP video (which I often do), I always skip the video to 35-40 seconds and it begins right from there.
Who all are gonna check these songs on YouTube now hit like 😂😂😂<br><br>Here’s the link just in case u need it 😂<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyOUzJw9oeg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyOUzJw9oeg</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1WjDb_zz_4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1WjDb_zz_4</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHbHE6nhVNw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHbHE6nhVNw</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qnA2qS3JIU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qnA2qS3JIU</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_5-Pfgmy70

If it&#39;s about Bollywood then it&#39;s bound to be either shameless or super illogical. <br>I don&#39;t understand why do we still have hopes with this failed industry  ?
I know the meaning of ABBG TPOG... ABBG = hey suno bibi g... TPOG = Tea (Chaaye) Piyo G... IPKI = Men Pee ke aayi... UPOG... You piyo G.... Lol
Bbg song was cute
Susu aa gaya re
Instead of singing the song yourself, you could play the actual song. That way at least we could judge the songs and not just take your word for it
Su suuuu...lol
When you started laughing while reading I lost it 😂😂😂
Uggh the lyrics are Soo cringy 😬🙃
your voice in Indian language is😘
Seems like some Rosesh Sarabhai poetry!

How many takes did it take you read out the lyrics.
Bollywood should be aptly named Bhaandkhaana.

Now i am going to spend my night searching all these songs and listening to them..You are definitely going to increase views on these hilarious songs...😂😂
ABBG TPOG has nice innovative lyrics. They actually make sense.
ABBG TPOG is a song from 1953.<br><br>No need to insult it. People were just having fun with the English alphabet.<br><br><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.music.indian.misc/Nou-qHT1JFo">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.music.indian.misc/Nou-qHT1JFo</a><br><br>This type of stuff is very old. When I first learnt the English alphabet <br>(around 1953) my uncle told me this. Dr. Kapoor may have heard it 10 <br>years earlier. I remember it as<br><br>biibii jii tea pii o jii = bahan jii chhay pio<br>pii ke aayii je  = pii kar aayi huu.N
Ur hindi killing me sounds sexy
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You forget to mention  tera pyar hukka bar from khiladi 786
Anmol speaking in hindi 😂 maza aa gaya 😂
OMG. LoL. I have to search these songs as I really can&#39;t believe how the singers had the guts and courage to sing such lyrics!

mango ko himesh ki awaz me sunana tha na...
There is one more song (chal baith ja baith gai ab khadi hoja khadi hogai). Film: ameer gareeb ( dev annad and hema malini ).
I have a view idea.<br>Most amazing voices of bollywood celebs.<br>Qader Khan<br>Amitabh Bachan<br>Rani Muker ji<br>Sir Devi
Damn.. OBBG TPOG.. IPKI UPOG..<br> This is smthing i was told whn in 5th std (22yrs ago!!) by a frnd of mine.. Feeling so nostalgic nw🙁.. Hd no idea a song ws md out of this..  Serendipity!!! ✌🏼✌🏼
Back then I used to think ABBG TPOG was pretty clever.... but then I grew up
Just 5? All lyrics in Bollywood leave me senseless these days. They have either left to be senseless since K3G or ABCDEFGHI in Hum Saath Saath Hai, the worst film I’ve ever seen.
Mein kya kr rha hu...😁😁😁😁
Susu aa Gaya re😂😂😂😂

&quot;Khada hai khada hai &quot; song of anil kapoor
Please make a video on asmr please please please please
You probably haven&#39;t heard the song from Amanat. And actually I&#39;m shocked that you have never included that masterpiece. It goes something like this...<br><br>Din mein leti hai...<br>Raat mein leti hai....<br>Subha mein leti hai...<br>Sham mein leti hai....<br>Bus mein leti hai ....<br>Car mein leti hai...<br><br>Kya Bura hai uska Naam leti hai... Kiska? Apne Saajan ka😂
Mango<br>No apple no tango....😂

Hey Jammy pants, give ur personal opinion on TOH.
Thankfully these are 5 Bollywood songs that I don&#39;t have on my MP3 player. And I have over 100 Bollywood songs on my MP3 player. I am planning on putting more on it. Since Bollywood/Indian music. Is all that I listen to through out most of the year. But thankfully the only real funny Bollywood song I have on my MP3 player is Kuke Kuke Koyaliya. That is one of my favorite workout songs. I don&#39;t know why. But I thought for a minute that song was going to be mention in this video. I am glad that it wasn&#39;t. I just love that song. But thankfully after seeing this video. I have no intentions of listening to these songs.
abhishek bacchan is still finding his place in bollywood
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Susu aa gaya re was a straight FU to modiji’s swacch bharat.
Do video on indian movies copied from korean movies
The last song really needs to be appreciated 😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂still laughing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Most of the Bollywood songs are senseless....now adays only few songs R meaning full but still it sounds the same like others...<br>Only the golden age of Bollywood songs were good....like the era O Kishore Kumar
Other notable absolute legends-1.choli ke peeche kya hai<br>2.daiyan daiyan<br>3.nibura nibura nibura<br>4.hum to tamboo me bamboo <br>5.khara hai,khara hai<br>6.dola re,dola re,dola re<br>7.oi Salle,ue ue Alle(shahrukh and pritty zinta<br>8.kothe upper kothri<br>9.a b c d e f g h I<br>10.tinku ji Yann <br><br>Inme se aapko sabse bekar kaun lagta hai aur aaplog bhi aa Karo...is list me
ROFL I Cracked up big time when you sang &quot;Susu As Gaya re&quot; ... And I used to think &quot;Bara Ana dey&quot; was the most horrible lyrics
MATLAB Kuch Bhi*<br>🤣
I just wait for your videos to watch as I find them really well made and interesting,  but you need to get your facts right. The last song is not from Tarazu but Insaaf ,  a movie released same year starring Shilpa Shetty and Akshay which took about 4 yrs to complete. You can check it as I have grown watching this crap during my college days. It was just fun in the 90s.
Abhay saleh ganeh ka video clip dalna chayh tah. Bakwas salah
Your laugh in-between is annoying.
after listening this i thought selfi mene leli aaj is still better lyrics
Mtlb hadh h
Himesh Reshammiya &amp; Sajid Wajid Are Worst Music Discovery By Salman Khan Because They Have Always Created Only Absurd &amp; Mediocore Songs With Some Meaningless Lyrics!!!!!!They Create These Songs Just For Money &amp; Not For Creativity!!!!!!!
I actually thought you had an orgasam at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVw6YoJsdGg&amp;t=173">2:53</a> saying those double meaning lyrics 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVw6YoJsdGg&amp;t=240">4:00</a> that lyrics made me go for a bathroom break
hindi me bolo
hindi bolo
Lollllll
How did the lyricist write this type of songs. And how the singers sang these songs
You That&#39;s The Reason Why Despite Having Talented Music Artistes We Cant Win Grammy Awards For Music Because We Always Accepting Mediocore Songs Which Have Meaningless Lyrics In Name Of Bloody Entertainment!!!!!!!
Himesh Reshammiya is better with music than acting
Bhai hindi mme he baat kara karo

Kya kar raha hu yar..!! <br>Sahi dialogue h bhai
U need to decrease and compress down the audio down of your intro music it&#39;s so annoyingly loud ,it should be close to the decibels of your talking voice . Otherwise very good job keep up the good work

THIS CHANNEL used to be fun, until isme KKR ka aaatma ghusgaya or overacting karne laga<br>I still dont understand why he has to make that almost &#39;whispering&#39; sound at the end of every comment<br>&quot;kuch vi&#39; &#39;Main kya kar raha hoon&#39;<br>just go back to doing how you used to do shit :/
Etna angrezi kahan se aati h tere ko 😄

😂😂😂😂😂. Sooooo funnnyyyyy. Loved this video<br>🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
but i like the song abbg tpog😉..... acc. to me this song is creative n intelligent😄😄
As usual...... Awesome!!!
Meri stumping ho gayi 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eww....Akshay&#39;s hair in chest. Is he human or gorilla? His chest looks so gross. 😷😷😷😷
It would have been better if u included vdos of the songs instead of still photographs so that v could listen to them.
Idk why does it make me cringe everytime you talk in Hindi😂😂
Kaan se khoon nikal gaya aise gaane sun ke...😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Awesome video
khadha hai khadha hai <br>dvar Par terse ashiq khadha hai <br>and btw Abhishek is still finding his place
isse a6a to humre dada ji  likhte hai
If you&#39;re reading this..I hope you have never heard any of these songs..
Haha awesome 👌<br>Hit like for T&amp;RP 👍
Can u like also post snippets of the actual songs used? So we know exactly how the songs sound
high on weed or someting else
Himesh is better than da caprio....😂😂😂
You always ask for video ideas at end of the video.. But always copy content of another channels 😂
ABBG TPOG was a pretty good song according to me though. Try making the lyrics with letters that rhymes with the other poetic lines of the song and with the situation of the movie.
gonna pee laughing at this video..<br>su su aa gaya main kya karoon.. 🤣🤣
I just loved the fact that he himself was laughing so much while singing these horrible songs😂😂😂😂
Good work keep it up amigo
Bhai tu English tak hi reh....tere muh se Hindi achi nai lagti😐
I know it is not easy to come up with unique list. Keep it going. Hope one day my channel can get this kind of reception :)
Ab kya karu?🤔
Please do a collab with cinema beyond entertainment
Ayee Haaye 😂
O god . U r listening all this to let us know. 😂😂 . Respect
Salman khan is nothing.. <br>All are watching his shitty movies just bcz he is a star.. Really 😂😂😂

Gaana sunao na yaar....<br>Tumare singing se to accha hoga.......
