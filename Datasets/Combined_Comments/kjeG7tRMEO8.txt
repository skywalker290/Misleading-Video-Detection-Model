Fake accent chopra madarchod
Priyanka is so educated beautiful and down to earth.always find the perfect words to say keep up the great job
India is proud of you PC
Yea say that now
Fake!!!
Love her in every here 💟
She is such a talented person I totally love her 💟😑💞
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjeG7tRMEO8&amp;t=353">5:53</a> she says I&#39;m sorry its a &quot;cricket&quot; reference. The subtitles say &quot;crooked&quot;🤦. Give it to the Americans.
Love Priyanka ❤️
Sorry but America and England started this equality fight before India had sovereignty.  The first battlegrounds are always the ugliest after the dust starts to clear.  There&#39;s no reason to be an arrogant judgemental prejudiced jerk about it, especially when comparing to a country with plenty of it&#39;s own faults(Modi).  This rhetoric harms America and hurts the spirit of it&#39;s citizens, and if hearing this criticism didn&#39;t hurt and feel like a hypocritical double standard to you, then maybe you aren&#39;t an American at heart.  Americans defend their country when it does the right thing, and they try to build it up.  They don&#39;t put it down for arriving fashionably late.  And VP Harris is quite fashionable in a formal way, so, guess America&#39;s just the Rockstar of the world once again.
She will be on top soon.
She is a such beautiful woman
Damn she roasted America with a perfect notch 😂😂😂🤣
I  really really really want to meet you dear 🌹❤️🥰😘 ........ I wish someday 🙏🙏
Let&#39;s just agree<br>Most of the people in comments are Indians<br>😁
What do you get when two idiots get together.  This.
Great you pronounced her name right. But I ask myself why I am appreciating this. Shouldn&#39;t it just be a given that we make an effort with names. Just like my Inidan grandmother that spoke not English made an effort to say every name correctly when she moved a western country? Why isn&#39;t that effort made towards all in any country?
At all nga
I dont have contacts nga
Saw my video nga hmhm:)
Hi nga
Is from my personal facts..
Herkoyiee sirff aapnoon kee Tallash men hee too more searching or for out of persent of my..persentation is prepration for next best ??
Woah what a reply❤
I&#39;m not for trolls here... but PCJ is the real Queen of Indian Cinema instead of that fake-ass Kangana Ranaut who seems to have completely lost her marbles. Not only has Priyanka achieved success in India, coming from a nobody to winning Miss World &amp; then into Bollywood.... but is now killing it in the US. She&#39;s happily married, she&#39;s poised, intelligent and unbiasedly expressive in her views, does a lot of philanthropic work, written a book, sings... and more!!! <br>Keep up the good work Priyanka. Best wishes from Australia.
Come on! they&#39;ve been married for a long time now.
Meanwhile she supports an authoritarian government back in India given that suits her better there.
welcome to the club, America <br>just wow , swag level pro max
Love you priyanka..our Desi girl as always..❤️❤️
<b>Welcome to the club, America</b> 🙌<br>Very well articulated!
&quot;Welcome to the club, America&quot;, wow she really said that.
my fav and second woman who inspired me a lot..... love you Priyanka
Dmn Talented lady I think whole over the world PC MM love
Hats off for vice president answer..... proud to be Indian
Omg in thumbnail I thought he z bill gates 😃😃😄😄
Pathetic how she has worn the accent to get acceptability.
Indira gandhi was prime minister of india(which is top most position in parliamentary democracy) and most powerful woman.she became pm in 1966 and continue  till 1984 barring 3 yrs in <a href="http://bw.in/">bw.In</a> 1984 she was assassinated by her own bodyguards otherwise she could have continued for 20 more <a href="http://years.so/">years.so</a> take a bow America.After that we had women like Sushma swaraj among others.I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some day priyanka becomes Us president.But I am sure she will never quit her indian citizenship
Priyanka we are proud of you dear..you are pride of our country..Love &amp; appreciate you somuch.
Like a BOSS😎😎!!!!!

This is the solution to every single mother around the globe. distance is not a barrier, he will surely make your dreams come trough. contact him today via whatsapp him +2348058748415 or DRSPENERHERBALHOME@<a href="http://gmail.com/">GMAIL.COM</a> if you also have infertility problems <br>unable to conceive, <br>Low sperm count <br>Diabetes <br>Fibroid<br>HERPES<br>HIV/AIDS<br>AND SO MANY MORE<br>PCOS or any other miracle in your life, contact him today so the world can be a better place to live. bye!!!
Her accent is fake as fuck....she doesn&#39;t sound like that omg lol
It&#39;s ironic that she is a so called &#39;Philanthropist&#39; but she does not talk in favor of her own country&#39;s oppressed farmers.
priyanka is great. i am so impressed with her answers. wish he all the best
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjeG7tRMEO8&amp;t=45">0:45</a> <br>Chwal nien indian sy american accent bn&#39;anay  ki try ki hai
She is so fake look at her indian interviews you wouldn&#39;t see her laughing unnecessary but when she is with American media she is constantly at it
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjeG7tRMEO8&amp;t=56">0:56</a> that&#39;s an ad for Amazon if you dont know. I bet that whistle soon after is planned too.<br><br>I hate these psychic ads that shape the way you think or associate with a product. It is unethical!
Priyanka is just best from every single side...❤️❤️
The most hypocrite woman.
Great
RAM looks like Anant Ambani....and i think ...i have seen the trailer before...
Priyanka achived those goals what she set for her sucess. Therefor i like her so much😍😍
Miss world for a reason❤️.Nobody is as confident,witty and intelligent as her.And she can be president in future but I don&#39;t think she will quit indian citizenship
Stop using the word woke when you have no idea what it means.
Always keeps our country&#39;s head held high 😊 Bravo!!!
I don’t like her
PC ❤️
Pc slayed with &quot;Welcome to the club America🔥
I am from India don&#39;t Cate of rich people make the! BB richer
I said the same thing to my friends, when on tv they were saying “we’re setting an example for the world”....What!!??? Do you know how many countries have already had female prime ministers and presidents ?? America is so far behind, it’s not even funny...The movie “White Tiger” is really good by the way...
❤❤❤
I love Priyanka Chopra Jonas...such a powerful and healthy presence!
The most successful Miss India n Miss World ever❤️
superb answer Priyanka 👍👍👍...<br>&quot;Welcome to the club America&quot; 😂😂
That female leadership answer 🤣🤣🤣
She nailed this.. 😂 :&#39;welcome to the club&#39;
America can have her. Good riddance
To be frank white tiger story has direct links to the movie &quot;accident&quot; by shakar nag the legend in Indian cinema.<br>Best of luck to her🙏
her real life journey is not less than movie ... inspiring and amazing
Women in India should hear this who got the &#39;feminist shot&#39; after Kamala Harris became the Vice president of the US.<br><br>Its the US, that just joined the club, we have been there for decades.
The way she answers shows that she has a good perspective and understanding of things in life
Why dont they explore poverty and crime in america and china and then expect an oscar?<br><br>Lagaan, Slumdog millionaire...gets an oscar...<br>Is there any pattern? Hell yes there is!<br><br>Oh btw if anyone is getting desperate to show their real selves here...well I keep reply notifications bcz guess wat I got a life!<br><br>So keep barking here below if anyone wants.
&quot;Hope this is not the last&quot; is what she wanted to say I think
African American?
Inglis accent 🍑
250 lbs
Who cares 🤣🤣
Curves came from age girl. Bye.
She’s pretty amazing isn’t she ....had no idea who she is ....will definitely watch this film 👍🏻❤️
She is being so fake, she is best when she is herself but when she tries to be someone she is not looks really bad on her.
Yep, few years ago, there was a stats on women leadership around the world, guess the country that was on top. Bangladesh. <br>India was (I think) 7th or so. America was 20th. <br>So yeah, “Welcome to the club, America”!<br>Queen will probably say, “you’re just about 100yrs late”!
They love Kamala already It&#39;s amazing to see Kamala Harris who has Indian heritage become a big leader in US she is brilliant lady just like Priyanka also atb for TWT 🐅❤️<br>I really love PCs accent too it&#39;s an amazing blend 👍🏻
I love her.<br>Seeing over there.<br>But I really miss her in India
I didn&#39;t knew VP is African American
Ugh priyanka has narc traits can&#39;t stand her
Why is every talk <a href="http://show.host/">show.host</a> asking her about kamala
Priyanka Chopra 👌👏👍
she self obsessed. super full of herself
She is damn gorgeous with brain and her answers are on point.
Why does she try to have an weird accent
People judge her claiming she owes her beauty to surgery, but I say she&#39;s beautiful inside and out. Who cares if she had work done! She&#39;s a beautiful person with a beautiful personality and a wonderful role model💙
Priyanka 👸
Celebrities like her need to back farmers protest and kashmiri rights
She&#39;s clearly nervous while trying to comprehend American accent..fumbling-tumbling and what!! It doesn&#39;t look nice at all... <br>Reel life..it&#39;s kind of acceptable..but..Why&#39;s she visibly so ashamed that she felt like concocting her entire personality every time she makes a public appearance.....<br> This is exactly what i call.. Ultra-American mindset.. 👎🏽👎🏻👎👎🏿👎🏼
She is cute
Indian blackyy dying to marry white here it goes one another blakkyy
My heart pounds with pride when Americans go gaga about her and say how lucky nick is<br>... that&#39;s our desi girl with spices😍😍😘
Priyanka Chopra is the most racist actress ever born in India. Please redo your lip job.
Bharati log bharat se bahar ja sakte hai par bharat unke andar se kabhi bahar nahi ja sakta .....welcome to the club America..
One of the Fame women from Hollywood
She is trying so hard to be like American. O please you still are Indian. You laugh 😆 without reason.
She is hypocrite.
She is the biggest hypocrite, she&#39;s war monger and big supporter of Modi/RSS who are responsible of Gujarat genocide under Modi&#39;s watch
She&#39;s ❤️
the way she speaks english is more better than people speaking English
fake-cent 😹😹😹😹
India had a woman PM from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980 to 1984.<br>Americans have been sleeping  for decades!  They seem  to  have woken  up  from  the slumber  , now!
Do the use the word &quot;driver&quot; in USA? I thought its an Indian word for chauffeur.
Dear America, <br>Not to insult you. But even Bangladesh has  Female Prime Minister. <br>Leave alone Bangladesh, Pakistan also had a Female PM.
She is AMAZING😇👑🔥
Salam dear friends, can you help me, that I have a sister who is living in America, she is very cute &amp; kind hearted. She is a islamic teacher, and she is a widow of 2 children. Can anyone help her to find a kind &amp; loving, caring groom for her insake of Almighty Allah &amp; pray for her inshaAllah
Her face looks different. Suddenly looks old??
So soo sooo proud of Priyanka !! What a woman !! 😍 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23jaihind">#JaiHind</a>
Love her the best .
Man get her off your program, horrible example of an Indian. But anything for showbiz, right Stephen?
The women prime minister of India that Priyanka mentioned is nothing to be proud of. Under her governance India saw some dark times including military rule in which many people died.
Whats type of interview is this ? The questions are so boring ? She is an anthropologist just to zay one of her jobs, ask some interesting questions man !
Stephen is so illiterate culturally while she is so robotic and conscious.
Yea. Welcome America. Let us not drool over the fact that the first female prime minister of India Indira Ghandhi was an authoritative disaster and India was literally on the verge of civil war in her government. But yay representation. Welcome to the club America.
Priyanka Chopra supports the Modi government of India, that is nationalist and racist. If you are not familiar with he Indian politics, the BJP party of Modi would be somewhere between the Trump administration and the Nazi Germany. Ironically and unashamedly she is here and acting like she is looking forward to the Biden administration
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOP2tZ4Nrxs">https://youtu.be/VOP2tZ4Nrxs</a>
Nick Jonas is one lucky man. Dayuuuuum. She&#39;s so gorgeous, eloquent, articulate and brilliant 👌💯😍😍😍
Quit Zoom
Ithink Miss World contestant s get special class how to talk
Her eyes looks different.. is it me/anyone else feels same ?
Americans think gender equality is really appreciated in America but get a wow when a woman reaches top leader. The third countries or whatever they&#39;re called had had a female prime minister or president a long ago
Oh priyanka we love you,but I don&#39;t like your answer on  Mrs vice President. Kamala didi.everyone need to be happy and show the excitement about her been the first Asian American to be vice president. Not condemn everything like is not new and exacting.we all love you.
&quot;Weicome to the club, America.&quot; It needed to be said. But Colbert was in flatter mode when he talked about her Zoom background.  He&#39;s forgetting he interviewed Anderson Cooper at home, the son and heir of Gloria Vanderbilt..You can see a whole bookcase-lined room behind him, There&#39;s a painting on one wall and a  tulip bulb chandelier lighting a hall beyond the open double doors. It was all I could do to concentrate on what they were saying and stop looky-looing at his house.
Boring interview
Well respond
The question is “Which family is more corrupt? Biden Family, Obama Family, Romney Family, Kerry Family or Clinton Family? Democrat’s virtues are lighter than a single fart of a Gorilla living in the jungle around Kilimanjaro mountain. And democrat’s greatness is not much bigger than insects which life circle begins and ends up on the pooop of tnat Gorilla. Does anyone have other understanding here?
ONE OF THE MOST FAKE LADY
Indian culture  considers women as equal to men. Sometime even superior as they are seen as life nurturing . Even the chief GOD of power or Shakthi is female mother Goddess.
she answers very beautifully amazing
I think he is the first one with the perfect pronounciation if her name 😂
mehh!
Awkward interview. Stephen is clearly not interested.
The country&#39;s name is India. Say it  Stephen . Stop bracketing India into South Asians.
Even a lot of developing countries have had women in high-level positions in government. I think a lot of Americans don&#39;t spend enough time looking at what other countries are doing because they think that they&#39;re the center of the universe. So much so that the US has fallen behind in my ways.
Many many 2 women .. one PM and one President.. besides faking an accent that&#39;s not hers
That was sooo exhausted low energy Host hosting a show with a  super High energy guest...meh
Does anyone know that she&#39;s a Bihari bhayyani  😁😂😎🙆‍♂️ &amp; Stephen Colbert is a Trump hater 🤷‍♂️😡😠
Like her , Though Movie White tiger is Racist trash .
In India actress are deemed old after 30 .so basically in India she is now an aunty and old and people are tired of her whereas in the Hollywood they rly do seem to like older stuffs . Have fun Hollywood 😂😂 oh u too nick jonas 😂😂
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23respect">#Respect</a>!!!
I cannot stop listening and looking at her. I love her
Its like Aunty n a boy...
Natasa stankovik Looks like priyanka chopra
I love that Stephen said that she has gotten married since the last time he saw her, and then: “Congratulations,... to Nick Jonas” ❤️
Really what an amazing performance. She nailed her character and produced an amazing piece of art
Fake accent
Did she just say “hope it’s not the first” ?!?🥴
I also finished my shift after getting robbed at gunpoint.  Welcome to America, dude.
Why does her teeth look weird
Priyanka ❤️❤️😍
I wonder why so much stress on VP being South East Asian. Where as her dad is a Jamaican as well. Why no stress on she being half Jamaican. Lol
PRYIANKA CHOBRA WITH A HIGLIGHTING LIPS . BRUISED LOOK😗
West always think like they are the role model <br>No you aren&#39;t <br>India has always been the role model for World even before you guys were destroying the world in the name of religions <br>West has always destroyed the world and culture of the native peoples
He didn&#39;t react to the any of of her answers, busy preparing the next question
The rare session specifically apologise because rhinoceros ostensibly transport as a moldy debt. decisive, colossal white
Boy I wish I could say being stuck in my house out of work for the last 10 months was a blessing.
Did he say african american to kamala harris
She looks like a PS4 graphic
She answered all the questions so well! Respect for her 👏
🙏..
Welcome to the club America😂😂👍
&quot;Welcome to the club, America&quot; wow, that is it. Keep it up, Priyanka. You make us proud!
😍🌹
🥰
But I don&#39;t like the &quot;white tiger&quot; movie because  it&#39;s kind of promoting bad things
Love her. She is beautiful and non pretentious.
Priyanka Chopra looks like Dinah drake ( Juliana harkavy ) from green arrow.
Yeah America is late to the game, like decades late in having female vp or anything, better late than never I guess. <br>woman make up over 50% of the population 🇨🇦✌🏻diversity is the face of our world.
She&#39;s pretty fake. Like her PM Modi.
Fake accent
PCJ is india&#39;s ambassador to US and the world .
These girl make fake accent for sure
Nick Jonas does not deserve her,... she is awesome, smart, intelligent, classy, interesting and beautiful😍
Greetings from Scotland ♥️ Lovely to see Priyanka and Stephen😊
Women Give Life.<br> Men defend the species from predators. but religions invented words that call creation the enemy for refusing to worship their words.
Congratulations Nick!
She trolled America. Only PC can do it with that grace.
She is a really intelligent person.Proud of her.That shade was amazing.Proud Indian.
The elite europe eventually shock because shampoo secondarily wonder within a best swallow. terrific, right heat
Say whatever she&#39;s amazing
Congratulations to Nick Jonas 😏
Such a smart answer on having female vc American. She’s making India proud!
I love her answer that India has already had women prime ministers and presidents... REALLY ❤️ welcome to the club America !
Every word coming out of her mouth is garbage. Pseudo feminist. Whats with the shity accent.
This one seems like the same kind of answer Aishwarya gave when she was asked for young people live with their parents and she answered well we don&#39;t have to take permission for dinners 😃 <br>Yes very well putted - we have set the example already you follow us America 😉 in short welcome to the club America 😂
I love and always loved her for the rest of my life 🥰
👏👏👏👏 welcome to club America  that savage
Read comedy of coffin on kindle..
Shes a hypocrite promoting skin lightening creams in india.. fans can be so blind to these things...
It&#39;s really good to see new actors being a lead actor of the movie alongside already great actors 🥰😍
Her answers are so precise !!! Our wonder / Desi girl.  Hope Nick is treating her right!!
Most confident women I have ever saw an inspiration ♥️
&quot;Welcome to the club,America&quot;😂<br>Savage👏💅
Not crooked,  it’s a ‘cricket’ reference
Lol as some one who works on a film set... I&#39;d get confused too if we didn&#39;t get the action / cut cues 🤣🤣🤣
Give her all the hate and trolls on the accent but she gives the best stand for all questions about India. Gang gang girl!
That was an awesome response &quot;Welcome to the club America&quot; ...PC rocks
Priyanka chopra Jonas or nick Jonas chopra maybe both
&quot;She is not woke&quot; Tell us about it. 😏
Am I the only one that keeps getting confused by her pronunciation of &quot;government&quot;. It sounds like she&#39;s saying &quot;governess&quot;?
South Asian?? PC is from India
Beautiful 🥀
Why has she made her lips so thick? There was no need. She looked cute even without the pout.
She defo looking her age now and Nick looks like a kid yikes
She&#39;s fav❤️
I feel like the White Tiger is one of the very few stories that is actually improved as a film. The whole book read so much as an action movie, I could just see it being made into a film. Priyanka just nailed the Pinky character wonderfully!
WELCOME TO THE CLUB AMERICA<br>what a Queen🔥
Priyanka is the voice and face of India ❤️❤️❤️
Great show, and the host is also good
Did anyone else realize she said &quot;I hope she&#39;s not the first&quot; instead of &quot;i hope she&#39;s not the last&quot; lol she was already sworn in!
Can we be done with the stereotypical questions on these talk shows? This format is so lame and needs to be updated.
She&#39;s so graceful, as Indians we are super proud of her. She is bringing Indian cinema to the global audience in a very big way!
did he just call her as a south asian woman???????????????????????????
India having a female prime minister doesnt prove anything indira gandhi was from a elite family her father was prime minister and president in india is a ceremonial role
Love from india
chopra + jonas= kamasutra😂
Priyanka 😍😍😍😍😍
Happiness toomamjiandsirji
The questions are not connected at all. What kind of interview is it?
Anything related to India in a video :<br>Indiaaaaanns assemble 🔥
PeeCee ❤️❤️
The strongest girl❤️
Priyanka Chopra ❤️❤️😍😍
She’s so well versed! Love hearing her talk!
Welcome to club, America... she completely nailed it.
No reason <br>Why I love her sooo much <br>Always making india proud <br>Proud of u impress ❤❤
The interview was cake eating,  so lovely💐!
Welcome to the club America 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
she is very intelligent
Is it just me or is there some awkwardness / Coldness from Colbert? Like he’s just going through the motions, for the sake of it and his heart is not really in it?
WOW!!
She says the same things on most of the shows.
She had never been a former miss world  as alleged Colbert.
&quot;I hope this is not the first&quot; -- eh?
Ahaha Clint Eastwood does that too! Never says action or cut lol
Is it me or does she sound like Gal Gadot?
Very well said, Priyanka!
No hate, but her lip looks little weird like on her top right or am I just seeing things. Like I said no hate
my fav is here you guys :) love her confidence
There are female presidents in every part of the world.it&#39;s embarrassing that the first democratic country in the globe still struggling to let women lead
Such overly poised, scripted answers- can get a bit annoying at times with Priyanka. I wish she would loosen up, shake up the answers a bit!
I am sure anyone who has been to Italy can say there is a difference between Italian food here and Italian food everywhere else. Some places are better than others, but it is not the same thing.And I am not the typical Italian proud of her heritage, except for the artistic one.
Kamala is an American. She&#39;s not an Indian. Her mother was. She&#39;s not a Jamaican either but her father was. Indians and Jamaicans are very good people.
The interviewer seems to have absolutely no interest in the answers she was giving and he kept asking new questions without reacting to her answers at all like he&#39;s not listening... what a crappy guy... but I&#39;m here for Pri and she delivered like the queen she is
She sounds so masculine.
She’s such a hypocrite. She invited Modi who has been quite notorious for helping communalism spread in India, to her wedding. She defended war. I used to love her but she’s so so hyporcite. I would have loved if she would have stood up to xenophobic, jingoistic propagandist and communalist leaders in Power in India like she fluttered her wings about having Harris and going out of Trump, who himself manifested the same maglomaniac qualities. Please, show some standards man! You can’t use Feminism or inclusivity to elevate your PR in America and patronize something else personally.
She is beyond amazing
Very good j👍🏽b Pri❤️❤️❤️yanka😘
I love her ❤️❤️❤️❤️
She is pretty with brain. But she always looks old to me, idk why
She deserves oscar winning Hollywood movies...beauty with brain..Go priyanka...Go INDIA
She’s interviewing well but Colbert isn’t responding to her comments directly. Seems like he’s not giving her a fair shot. Watch his interviews with others
I come from watch White Tiger, what a movie, Priyanka!!!!!
Why does it feel like Stephen is not interested only ?? It feels like just wants to get done with set if questions !!!
She’s wearing only one earrings right?
Loved the movie-The White Tiger directed by Ramin Bahrani. Brilliant Director.
White Tiger, an awesome Movie. A must watch!
she&#39;s so beautiful inside and out!
Priyanka Chopra has defined herself<br>and India in this show.She is so eloquent, smart and confident.<br>Woman&#39;s power everyone.<br>Be Blessed Always.❤💕🙏💕❤✌
At one point she made America feel better by saying that at certain places the food IS authentic but then absolutely burned by saying &quot;Welcome to the club&quot; 💀😂
Always PC PR in comments section, did like her answers!
She is our pride ; love from India :)
Zoom<br>Background rivals Michael beschloss
Dont why she is looking more cuter
So much nose touching...
Whats wrong with Colbert? Why does he interview Psychopaths?
I love all her recent interviews.. she looks more calm and composed and it feels like she is just being herself.. this is what i wanted to see from pc.. please be your real self
She has an American accent now?
Enjoy!
I don&#39;t know who is being fooled nag. Myself yourself or mediators nag we need to be careful nga
On authentic Indian food , what she meant was “ only a few restaurants serve real Indian food 😂
Wow looking pretty Priyanka ji
She&#39;s so gorgeous, the most beautiful woman
Maybe a stupid question, but where can I find the full versions of these cool songs that are being played at the beginning and the end? They sound so awesome and I would like to hear them fully. Is there a specific John Baptiste &quot;Colbert&quot; Album?
Thank you for making America realise that having a female, South Asian vice president is not that much of a big deal. I am from Sri Lanka and we had the the first female president in the world so welcome to the club America you have a lot to learn!
I thought she is he is, i mean a boy put in makeup
She is gorgeous! But can Nick handle her.....😆
Nick is thee luckiest dude in the world, she is so f*cking sexy dude omfg
she is beauty, she is grace, she is now miss united states
I could see she was married before she opened her mouth, so much happier when she was single...
Is Priyanka chopra Pregnant??
Everything is perspective huh!
America is the world’s number one country, but there are some flaws with women’s rights, that still need some work to be done in this category!!
I used to be really lean too haha
White tiger is a suspense drama movie with great actors
Ew Priyanka
She&#39;s lying with a fake accent guys. Pls excuse
white american dude got their brown indian  woman...
Oh wow I actually want to see this movie
Jackson heights!
Amazing 🤩 waiting to watch
Indian food doesn’t taste Indian in the USA at all!... it is americanized for sure.. May be in major cities like Seattle, NYC, LA, San Hose, Houston.. etc. we might get that authentic taste.
She seems so sweet! ❤️✌🏽😌
You gotta love her welcome to the club that’s all she said you would think that she has gone to America and she would be trying to please everyone there but every time she has an interview she always puts India first and that’s why I love her for that she is the best ambassador for India and it is true India is way ahead of the world in so many aspects but because of the media and the stereotype that it creates people don’t realise How ahead of time India was and still is
Welcome to the club America ha ha hah love this girl that is the reason I love this girl
She is soooo well spoken. Wow
I have read the book, please don&#39;t think it
sorry not intrested on this guest she is worst has trump she is mouth voice of RSS hindutva modi bjp who spreads hatered against minorities in India
Priyanka used to churn out 3 or 4 bollywood movies a year and qulity of roles improved in last few years now her career in hollywood that doesn&#39;t  have significant female character driven movies where even big names like Jennifer Lawrence and Julia Roberts gets good roles not often or every few years I wonder if she thinks Hollywood is a step down for her career!
I&#39;ve had Colombian food that&#39;s authentic here in the US!
What&#39;s up with the fake accent?
Are there India-flavored IKEA meatballs?
Priyanka gave the best answer for the food. And the “Welcome to the Club, America” is exactly what I felt. 🥰❤️😻
Adding a few pounds there PC! Expecting a baby jonas??
The White Tiger is really good
I mean like she can talk?? India is in shit hole over thier extreme Government. Whole country is suffering under current PM Modi who is superior cast fanatic.
Why does Indian actresses overact way too much than necessary every time they are on TV?
Wonderful book. I’m holding judgment on the film.
Lol to insinuate women are treated well in India is like insinuating trans women are treated well in America. Hint: not very fucking well xs
Oh how much she&#39;s trying to fake that American accent
Queen we love you.. 👑❤️
Welcome to the club...india congratulates america 🙏

This is so sad and depressing to watch
This is so awesome 😎 I&#39;m just going to go watch my old school India show because I&#39;m old 🗝️ lol and spend time with the Japanese daughter and I&#39;m white lol 🤣 I just really wonder...

Welcome to the club America
Thanks Stephen Colbert. You were there through all the lies, the scandals, the name-calling, and the Nazi-like policies. You were with me when i wanted to scream  out loud and bang my head against the wall. You made me laugh. You let me know that you hated him as much as i did. You were a light in the long tunnel of darkness. Thank you. God bless you. Keep smiling.
I totally love the way she is so global,  always praising her country and never putting down Indians .
<b>Welcome to the club</b> <br>Yupp babe burn them down 😂
She is pregnant
Ugh
I think Im in love.  Brains and looks in equal measure.  Hope to see more of her.  Sorry Stephen, I know you thought I meant you.
What an unprofessional director! no action, no cut!!! Oh the calamity!!!!
Last time I checked, Indira Ghandi, Benazri Bhutto, and Sirimavo had the political stage set for them.  It’s not the same for Kamala Harris. So let’s give credit when it’s due.
Love herrr
Why is she so gorgeous???!!!!! Gawd!!!
She looks sooo beautiful  as usual...?
&quot;It&#39;s almost like a race.&quot; My favorite Reform School Girls quote! Hashtag Stay Clean, i mean Stay Rich
America was archaic with having women in government---but not anymore! We are gonna catch up!
&quot;Hey I&#39;ll give you a ~Trial Period~ without any end at a discounted rate then stare you down for hours from a platform above you in a weirdly over-lighted area of my trash clothes warehouse. Yknow anything about Ghana? Or Oklahoma?? Got any Lean?&quot; - Courtney Love
Shieeeey
I agree with Priyanka. Embrace Zoom. Don&#39;t be afraid of computers. This is an introverts paradise.
She is <br>A  for good person <br>B  for acting in bollywood <br>F for acting in Hollywood
She broke Covid lockdown in London to get her hair done!
I can agree with that. I&#39;ve visited India a few times with family and I will say that almost every cuisine has some kind of Indian twist to it, even pizza!
PeeCee 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I really can&#39;t get enough of her wittiness and sharpness !!!
❤️pc love and the movie amazing wowww 😘😘
No no where you find indian authentic food in US as she doesn’t go to Authentic restaurant in India.
That&#39;s Clint Eastwood&#39;s way of directing,
This has nothing to do with the conversation, but on the left-hand side when we look at the screen, there&#39;s a thing with all the white branches and stuff in it. Good Lord. That is so good looking. I&#39;m always trying to put branches and White Birch and pots and make them look cute. But that is stunning. And I&#39;m sorry folks it has nothing to do with what we&#39;re talking about. I just thought it looked really cool. So now I&#39;ll go back and get serious and listen. <br>Peace and blessings everyone. I didn&#39;t think we were going to make it to January 23, 2021.  Oh my God. Today is 23 January. My dad has been gone since the mid-80s. And I just realized he would&#39;ve been 97 years old today. Holy cow happy birthday daddy.. I do miss you... but I really stink at remembering dates.
She is such a sweetie. And they still like each other. That&#39;s half the battle right there. She has a beautiful smile and you can tell she has a beautiful spirit. I have never heard her interviewed before. And you&#39;re right Stephen is smiling more. But I think about 80 million of us are.
I absolutely loved the novel. Can&#39;t wait to enjoy the movie on Netflix. I&#39;m sure Priyanka is fabulous in it! Yay!
Who&#39;s this? The princess of Monaco? The queen of Jordan? Oh, her name is Priyanka.. she&#39;s an actress?
Yes she is right. India had a female Prime Minister and a female President. Even india had a muslim President in a country with 80% Hindus
<b>Stephen:</b> &quot;When I first interviewed you, you were already huge...&quot;<br><b>Me:</b> &quot;Did he just call her fat?&quot;<br><b>Stephen:</b> &quot;... in India&quot;<br><b>Me:</b> &quot;Oh thank God.&quot;
Priyanka is embarrassing, a total and complete fraud. Why are you all SO INTO IDENTITY?
This is one gorgeous women
Awesome
Can&#39;t stand this woman. M
I like how her answers are so on point and unique
As far as that story goes of the director not calling “action” or “cut”, well, Bruce Lee said it best....
Is it me, or she and Gal Gadot really sound like each other?
Who is chopika? 🙄
Damn.. she&#39;s pretty 🦋.
She looks like a tan Ivanka... both beautiful
Watched half the movie. Great potential in the script but the constant narration by the lead character breaks movie momentum and doesn’t allow the movie viewing experience. <br>Will finish remaining part and hope that will change my opinion.<br><br>Finally, those who have not watched Parasite are missing one of the best movies based social divide.
Wow, a WH that &quot;looks like the world.&quot;<br><br>Earth to America: Welcome aboard!<br>US: Isn&#39;t that against the law or something?
In the clip, did she mean &quot;bottega&quot; or &quot;bodega&quot; According to the Mirriam-Webster online dictionary, a bottega is &quot;the studio/workshop of a major artist in which other artists may participate in the execution of the projects or commissions of the major artist.&quot; Like the designer &quot;Bottega Veneta.&quot; A &quot;bodega&quot; in New York City, is a small-owner operated convenience/corner/neighbourhood store. &quot;Bodega&quot; is a Spanish word that means &quot;storeroom&quot; or &quot;wine cellar.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m going to take an educated guess that she meant the latter but pronounced it as the former...<br><br>The subtitles that you see in the clip, spell it as &quot;botaiga&quot; maybe because of her pronunciation...?<br><br>And who knew that bodega owners in NYC became so rich?? They must own A LOT of bodegas...
Very good and witty  response to kamla Harris election.
This woman is an inspiration for so many people
I&#39;ve read the book and its very memorable. But I think it is huge miscast to play Madame Pinky for Priyanka. At the book Pinky Madame is blond and white skinned, typical American woman. <br>And the book ending is not so happy, there is no protagonist there, all people at the book are mean or stupid.
such a professional  interviewer though 🥰🤩
I&#39;m confused, is she saying the world isn&#39;t entirely made up of wealthy, elderly, white men.
Priyanka just nailed it
Every country on the Indian subcontinent has had at least one female Prime Minister or President, some of them multiple times. Even Pakistan! The US of A has a lot of catching up to do...
What a gorgeous woman, curves and all! ... And don&#39;t forget that she&#39;s bright, articulate, and sassy... Maybe she can run for president one day!
She oozes confidence. That&#39;s always attractive.
Welcome to the Club. Indira Gandhi likes the comment.
She is a really shallow person but pretends to be deep. But she is intelligent.
Nobody cares about pryiyanka chropra anymore goodbye yes I wrote that drunk but it’s true<br>Go have your happy life with da jonas and leave someone space who’s a little more interesting<br>Good bye
There is nothing called South Asian...Dumbo???
It tends not to be indian but mughali cuisine.
We really miss her in bollywood..
Why do people label Kamal Harris African American? Isn&#39;t her ancestry Indian and Jamaican?
Why does she touch her nose so much?

Her eloquence is unmatched.
Hindu Supremacist, who supports Narendra Modi and his policies in India. She&#39;s no different than all those white supremacists who attacked the people&#39;s house on 6th of January. You should do a little research before inviting such people on your show.
How is Harris &quot;African American?&quot;
love her
Lol don&#39;t get swayed by that &quot;Welcome to the club, America&quot; statement, American people. You&#39;re far-far ahead. India has only ever had ONE female Prime Minister and she was murdered in cold blood during her term. None of female representatives in the Indian govt at lesser positions are competent. None. In comparison to Kamala, none of them hold any ground. Also, America has had female representatives in the government on equivalent positions since a long time already. Priyanka just said what she said to be diplomatically correct for PR reasons. Cause she&#39;s had to face strong backlash from the corrupt Indian News Media before for being herself, being honest and straight forward
Lot of love to priyanka..God bless
She is so gorgeous. She should be next ‘wonder women’. She already played a tough female boxer role .
The cool queen formally sigh because decision happily itch beneath a ruthless canada. chivalrous, guiltless chinese
I love her ❣️
Queen Priyanka Chopra Jonas 😌✨
No matter how hard I try to hate her ,she always seems to capture my❤️...love how she is always proud of her motherland.
Beauty, Brains AND HEART! That was pleasant.
Nick is one lucky SOB
Damn, that is one hell of a zoom background. She&#39;s beautiful too, of course.
Look at her... How much proud she is about India!!
Welcome to the club!!! She is our greatest representative on the global stage😍
america accepts her flesh as sacrifice for her country
She is like wonder women in obese. No issues, she is good actor.
Its disturbing why she doesnt use the word caste, which is what the movie is about
<b>FACT:</b> There&#39;s been <b>just one</b> female Indian Prime Minister till now, that too because her <b>surname</b> was <b>Gandhi.</b> I can&#39;t imagine having a female PM or 2nd most powerful leader with <b>foreign</b> roots. So We Indians should come back to earth.
Priyanka Chopra supports the RW in india, where it&#39;s the popular choice <br><br>And she supports the Left in USA where it&#39;s the popular choice
Oh priyanka that&#39;s not our accent ... But funny though ... Love u PCJ ❤️❤️
She is a women of substance... Love her so much from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩
She is so graceful
She sounds just like Elizabeth Peña from Jacob’s Ladder and Lone Star.
The Indian food in the states is NOT SO AUTHENTIC AS YOU CLAIM!!!
“Welcome to the club, America.”  That was just so APT!  DOPEASS woman!!❤️🥺
Intervening her just because Kamala Harris became the VP is so dumb. At least you should have interviewed IMF chief Gita Gopinathan or Raghuram Rajan for that matter. or Dr Deepak Chopra. People expect better from you Stephen.
what an amazing woman
@StephenColbert So that&#39;s what it took for you to have her back on the show. US electing it&#39;s first woman (of Indian origin) as vice president… 😆😆
Gawd damn Nick. You must be blind. like eww
What is this nonsense: Stephen calling her South Asian woman and not an Indian woman? She does not correct him either!!
I’ve loved Priyanka ever since I watched Quantico. She’s so great and now she’s married to Nick Jonas which is just double amazing
Stephen misses interviewing priyanka physically.especially his eyes which were pointed at some body part of PC in the last interview.i feel for you buddy.
Double standards - she still supports a fascist in her homeland.
Ok Stephen looks hot not gonna lie
Stephen needs to work on his “interview” skills, he left Priyanka and us hanging so many times by not linking past questions and comments to the new ones. It came off cold and amateurish on his end at those moments. There were some good moments, albeit few where he did keep the rapport and chat going between questions.
She is a very beautiful woman .
Its an awesome movie.  Just saw it.
Her answers are always so intelligent 🔥
If Megan runs for prez in 2024.......is it First Man Prince Harry or Prince First Man Harry?
Let’s be honest; authentic Chinese cuisine in America would be illegal
So far, most of the comments are positive. That is good to read. More power to Priyanka.
Easy to have a nice set up when you have a couple thousand dollars lying around. Was Probably using the wad of cash as a doorstop.
She&#39;s so middle-aged.
nick jonas, damn man.
Well done interview. Priyanka is a rare combination of International Superstar, and superb actor
She&#39;s so good in this interview.... And the zoom background totally wins 😁
<b>This women is old ASF I been seeing her in indian movies since I was 10 and I am old now she&#39;s had so many affairs with fellow indian actors even the married ones, she&#39;s nothing but plastic surgery grandma</b>
Wanna be &quot;La ish &quot;
Wow...I really like her. I&#39;m pleasantly surprised.
So refreshing to hear her say &quot;welcome to the club&quot;! It&#39;s about time America realises that it&#39;s not the first and best in everything.
what an absolute angel
She was great in White Tiger!
We love you Priyanka! Proud to see you on this show 😍
She&#39;s smoking. Beautiful woman from India. Hope she play a Marvel Super-villain.
I completely adore her!
I remember when Nick Jonas and his then-girlfriend tweeted positive things about Trump in 2011.
She&#39;s simply beautiful... adorable! Great actress, too!
She’s so stunning
Ivanka Trump and Priyanka Jonas look alike 😁😂
She’s so charming ❤️
&quot;Six months&quot;... &quot;have that time together&quot;<br>Looking down the barrel of 18+ months... alone. I.. I... wish them well ;)
So excited for the movieeeee!❤
something went wrong with her lips in surgery.
Please!!!    Let&#39;s all vow to never speak the last president&#39;s name again!!!!          As an attention hungry troll, that is the worst thing we can do to him!!!!           <br>(Well,  i mean criminal charges would be good too)...
❤❤
she&#39;s right. even islands have women as prime ministers. Trinidad is one of them had a woman kamla persad i think like over 10 years ago. america is really late to the game here. a bit backward but welcome!
What happened to her lips?
I don&#39;t care what ethnicity my leaders are as long as they&#39;re <i>competent</i> and <i>ethical.</i>
She is only a few months younger than me but soooooo much cooler and more successful. What happened to me?!?!?
Perfection= Priyanka Chopra &lt;3  ✓
She’s cool. I didn’t know what to expect
Late show ratings go down. <br>Call them brown people!
What a gorgeous beauty!
She sales a skin bleaching cream in India.
God... priyanka is an insufferable hypocrite talking about blm in America while encouraging war and attacks on minorities back home.
No. Joe Biden was chosen as the Democratic candidate and then elected President. Joe Biden chose Harris as his V.P. She was elected because he was elected. She couldn&#39;t even get just Democrats to vote for her.
Priyanka conveniently avoided talking about the caste system which is someone&#39;s fate defined by his birth. Cisco caste case in 2020 has proved someone can not defy his caste division even when you move to America. Hope someday, we can talk more about caste candidly and find solutions for all who believe in caste.
If you make Indian food=Curry, more Curry, and most Curry!  If you drive into a neighborhood and there&#39;s an Indian home, you can find it by the strong odor of Curry!
shes having a hard time keeping that cocaine drip in check
Honestly, people will see Priyanka&#39;s &quot;welcome to the club, America&quot; as shade but really it&#39;s a tired statement and Priyanka knows it.<br>Stephen assuming the fact she will be thrilled because she&#39;s a social advocate but fail to piece she&#39;s from India, still an Indian nationale is utterly embarassing. Not to pick on Mr. Colbert as it&#39;s not a novel sentiment but it is very disappointing to see it embolded in a public space. And sure, America, feel free to celebrate your successes, but don&#39;t be disappointed that some of us stop tolerating this one-sided conversation.
I came for the Late Show, I stayed for the Bokeh, I became hypnotized by the Moire effect - Julius Caesar
Not sure why I&#39;m supposed to care about someone who&#39;s biggest accomplishment was marrying a Jonas brother, but whatever.
Subbed! I mean, watching this movie! Great interview
She is so beautiful. Great interview.
Sometimes I really think these people doesn&#39;t live in this planet. Don&#39;t they know who Kamala is? Just because she&#39;s a woman doesn&#39;t mean that she deserves all this heroic presentation. Come on people, show some rationality.
oh she married a white guy, totaly qualified.
Didn&#39;t listen to a word of this to be honest.....
What a wonderful, authentic, engaging laughter she has! Kudos to Stephen for having a good conversation with Priyanka.
That cricket joke is the best thing .
and I was just thinking &quot;is she related to Nick?&quot; rofl
Love her!
What a lovely woman, both inside and out. And on a completely unrelated note, I need to find some Indian cuisine next chance I get!
She looks better now , better than before ultra thin
is she pregnant ?...she is kind of glowing
Kamala is not even part African American.  She&#39;s Jamaican.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjeG7tRMEO8&amp;t=2">0:02</a> what is the name of the girl next to the drummer?
Welcome to a dream land &quot;America&quot;.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23priyanka">#Priyanka</a> red lipstick doesnt work for her skin tone. The lips get more attention than the whole face. She should use a more subdued color.
both of them are luciferians ands they are paid to push left agenda biden will bring nothing but the beast!!!! trump was our pnly hope
Thanks for this interview. To be honest, I had started to find Priyanka getting a little too full of herself a few years ago and stopped watching her movies. But today she came across as more down to earth and not too &#39;try hard&#39; to fit into American culture. As a woman of South Asian descent, I also felt that I could finally relate to a public figure when VP Harris was taking her oath and it hit a really personal note for me.
I heard they did the same thing with The Office. All the actors would act like they&#39;re working, and the directors would say, &quot;whenever you&#39;re ready.&quot; It created a more authentic show.
Brazil had a woman president but we impeached, ilsulted and humiliated her even though she committed no crimes -- there has never been any basis for prosecution --, and has more integrity than 98% of our congress. So we can&#39;t really gloat about that.
My Same date born mate! :)
Loving seeing the show band playing together ❤️❤️
Excellent program
PRI is amazing, she&#39;s beauty with brain Queen 👑
“Welcome to the club, America!” Queen👑
1. She is FAWKIN CLASSY!<br>2. I bet India kicking themselves for making her miss World and not Miss Universe contestant. One of the most beautiful women on d damn planet right there.
The so-called developing countries India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh... each of these countries have ELECTED women prime minister/president before, in fact, as early as the 1960s in some countries. It is 2021 and Americans are celebrating Kamala Harris being a vice president as if they have discovered a parallel universe where women can actually be vice president. Yet, America (or shall we say Americans) look at the countries listed above and claim them to be backward, or developing or unevolved. Ironic much!!
In Toronto Canada you can get super authentic Hakka Chinese (Indian+Chinese Food).    You gotta try it folks.
Hit Like if you think that Priyanka Chopra is pregnant.
No Priyanka, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan may have had women in leadership, but the treatment of women in those countries is pure crap and you know it. Please don’t try to sell you’re used to seeing women in power. Because as you know yourself, you may be powerful, and may be a UN Ambassador for peace, but what really counts is how you respond to critics. Like telling a woman who disagrees with you to not embarrass herself, while supporting war, ‘Jai Hind’ was it?
I don&#39;t know where the curves came from, but, I&#39;m damned glad they are there...   ;-)
oh so priyanka chopra basically plays herself? cool
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23colbert">#Colbert</a> Yo! More <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tooningoutnews">#TooningOutNews</a> Pimpn😃  Please &amp; Thank you much😘😊
Her American accent is amazing in the clip.
Stephen made a quick save switching his congratulations to Nick.  One does NOT congratulate the bride, as it implies that she was trying to trap him.  Congratulating the groom is OK, assuming that he &quot;won&quot; the bride&#39;s heart.  You just extend your &quot;best wishes&quot; to the bride (for the couple&#39;s future).
She is so beautiful!
Whose THAT BBW and WHERE is Priyanka Chopra???
She&#39;s just lovely.
Super authentic = Lights your mouth on fire makes your eyes tear LOL
No,no,no! Stephen Colbert should have done proper research on her before bringing her into his show. Before she makes any comment about American Politics, she should give her own explanation to an American audience about that rubbish Modi nationalism she has played a part in by using her Bollywood public figure. Rubbish, rubbish! She supports oppression in her homeland and comes to North America to praise Kamala Harris?! Give me a break!
Still gutted, damn you Nick!
oups Stephen had a case of &#39;&#39;foot in the mouth &#39;&#39;<br>when he ask about how did she feel about the fact that it was the first black,  asian woman elected in the white house<br>her answer<br>WELL  welcome to the club America lol<br>that was a great answer , it&#39;s about time the US elect women
Such a Queen🔥
Congrats Priyanka Chopra👍
Clint Eastwood was known for directing like that. Good to see you Priyanka
Pathetic loser. Colbert sucks<br>BRING LETTERMAN BACK
Some of my darling Priyanka&#39;s movies are awesome. Great actress!
If you close your eyes you swear it was Gal Gadot. Anyone else hear that?
Go Priyanka!!<br>All the love from Jamshedpur Jharkhand 🙏🙏❤️❤️
Welcome VP Kamila Harris<br> Humans were united long before the invention of words divided us.
She is looking horrible, love from India❤️
Fake feel
That&#39;s a role model. Inner and outer beauty. Inner and outer strength.
I hope they do justice to the book.
Stephen Colbert do you know that she is ardent supporter &quot;Indian version of Trump&quot;?
She&#39;s awesome
A beautiful, talented woman, right up there with Kajol and Deepika Padukone as the greatest Indian actresses of all time.
Black? African-American? Not important. Sane? Much more important.
&#39;Welcome to the club&quot; that burn will be one to remember...
&quot;I hope, this is not the first&quot; ???
@charlene porter its a japanese skin lightening lotion. It says in the article the african american celebrities in hollywood use it and is strong enough that it changes their skin color from dark skin to light skin mixed race,however they deny it <a href="https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/bleaching-skin-lightening-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml-top-selling-product">https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/bleaching-skin-lightening-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml-top-selling-product</a>  i guess they deny using this  lotion because they just want people to think they are naturally light skinned and not bleaching their skin lighter, they should just be honest.
❤️
welcome to the club america. its sooo long overdue. loads of so called 3rd world countries already have female presidents and prime ministers. but....well, yeah...enjoy.
I would Love to hear VP Kamala Harris&#39;s Jamaican accent or Indian accent set free.
&quot;How is pandemic marriage?&quot;<br><br>Well...I think this is the first time that there are a record number of births AND divorces during the same time period.
I like how she says &quot;Welcome to the club America&quot;. Greatest country in the world takes the longest time for a woman and black person to be in a high government position.<br><br>Update: Wow so many ppl are up in arms with this simple comment. <br><br>Listen the greatest country - is a self proclaimed title they gave themselves, if you didn&#39;t pick up on the sarcasm - then I can&#39;t help you understand nuances. I mean if someone went around saying they were the greatest person ever born, and you took them seriously, I&#39;d be worried for you. <br><br>Sarcasm, ppl sarcasm. <br><br>And chill. My goodness. Surely there are more exciting things happening in your life than this measly comment. Geez.
Her accent is all over place 🙄
<b><i>fake accent</i></b>
&quot;Several&quot; women in governance from prime minsters to presidents? Lol. We had exactly one female prime minister (who, despite being a strong leader, would not have been PM if not for being the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru) and one female president (a ceremonial head). Both instances cannot be compared with that of Kamala Harris who had a humble upbringing and who built her career from ground up. &quot;Welcome to the club&quot; my ass.
Lean, Mean, Chopra Machine
Did they whitewash Priyanka Chopra??????
I couldn&#39;t understand much of what Baran (Baram?) said.
Priyanka ❤️
Her accent really is faker than Donald Trump’s tan
INDIAN ITALIAN!?!?!?!?!?! I MUST HAVE IT!!
Awoke?
Yes , The Grand hooker prize.
Is she... prego?
She couldn&#39;t find bones here so she settled for Jones.
That&#39;s a nice fireplace in the background. Is that a gas fireplace?
Beautiful 😍
Bernie 2024!
I would love to try Indian interpretations of non-Indian cuisines.
Jamaica has also had female leadership, America’s mad late 😂
Priyanka : When convenient, we bat for ourselves. Sorry, that&#39;s a cricket reference<br><br>YouTube subtitle : That&#39;s a crooked reference <br>Lol!!
Welcome to the club loooooool
Indian Chinese food is sooooooooo the best
It is high time, America was brought back to the middle ages with Trump at the wheel and now it&#39;s time to get rid of the people who are still in congress who&#39;s thought process is to keep the rich richer and not help the people who actually need help.Especially the homeless, kissimmee florida for instance still has No shelter!!! The time that the state got 8 million dollars to build a homeless shelter here in kissimmee decided to reapropriate the funds ,quite a bit into their own pockets for which only one person went to jail for,the rest was used to make the lakefront park prettier and if you&#39;re homeless and found sleeping in that park you go to jail, it&#39;s also illegal to panhandle,ask for money,in kissimmee and you go to jail. They set it up so that the homeless will alwayfail and have no way to get any help. Who do I talk to about changing this? Cause I&#39;ve tried and if you don&#39;t have a little money cause you&#39;re disabled and can&#39;t work, trying to get SSDI,which takes years here, your screwed.
I think she&#39;s over rated in India...
This looks amazing. Looking forward to watching!
She’s a terrible person. She is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador yet posted a tweet on February 26 2019 that appeared to support an announcement from India that it had launched airstrikes in Pakistani territory. She scoffed at a Pakistani-American woman&#39;s challenging question to her at the BeautyCon summit in Los Angeles saying: <br>&quot;War is not something I&#39;m really fond of, but I am patriotic&quot;.
Problem is, leadership shouldn&#39;t  LOOK amazing, it should BE amazing. And that means taking care of its citizens, providing for them and fixing problems, not looking diverse just for the look of it
She&#39;s really good at being interviewed.
Wonderful humain being. Looking forward to watch her movie.
But India has such huge gender inequality!
Priyanka was very lovely and smart and trying to connect with Stephen, but he missed most of the interview, Sad... He, somehow managed to be there but not be there most of the 9+ minutes that the video lasted.
I was eagerly waiting for this interview for a long time.<br><b>WORTH IT</b>

Americans are weird. What exactly is a south-Asian? I’m better in Geography than most of you and have visited most of Asia myself. Nobody in the world would call anyone from e.g. the Philippines a South Asian. Yet Americans do, as they call blacks African American no matter where they really came from. So either call the country out she is from or call her American. Else the world might think about calling you North Americans or better European-Americans. (while we are fully aware that it’s not the case)
I can&#39;t wait until I meet an Indian cause I&#39;ll get to ask her every question about India and brown people I ever wanted. Lol!
For some reason I reckon she&#39;s pregnant...

man i had huge crush on her when i was young.
Even Pakistani had a female president.
This was such a good book. Cool that’ll be a movie.
Welcome to the club America
I had almost disliked the video until she said welcome to the bloody club America. You go girl. Put them in their place I say. 👏 👏 👏 it’s about time they had women in the main roles of the governance. Hopefully the pay parity with end soon.
Don&#39;t be stupid Priyanka. Don&#39;t dumb it down. Go harder.
In her home country she supports Narendra Modi . A fascist radical and prime minister of India .
Precisely! The USA needs to catch-up

Beautiful and interesting woman, I only wonder why so many women in the film industry have to enlarge their upper lip (or they want it them selves)? Natural is, in my opinion, most of the times, more appealing and less distracting.
It was historic.  Kamala was the first, female VP to gain the position, by STEALING the 2020 election, along with creepy-Joe.
❤
She was so pretty b4, what happened to her lips?
I don&#39;t like the term East Asian. They have always been Indian,  with the red dot on their forehead. I have never known them to call themselves Asian in India!!! They shave their 2 year old daughter&#39;s hair. How it has always been in NYC. Indian food. It&#39;s so good too.
Ok I don&#39;t get why the new VP is labeled  South Asian by all the media outlets, either say Asian or Indian American.
Wow..she said the right thing.. In case of women empowerment US is still backwards than India😂
She was in the 12th grade and feeling herself...hmmm <br><br>Phrasing...
Oh are we finally shining light on the “cast” system in India that categorizes everyone at birth for the rest of the life? Crazy, welcome to the club India..born into wealth and labeled by it forever..is not an American concept lol. Whether with a woman PM or not.
Just like Anushka, Priyanka doesn&#39;t get enough praise for paving path for diverse Indian talent. Maybe Karan Johar and Yash Raj Flims should take notes...
Maybe Stephen should have asked priyanka about the blood thirsty tyrant she supports in India.
Get that woman a kleenix. Or give her a close up.
Lol the irony of Priyanka playing a character that thinks she is &quot;woke&quot;
She sounds like Gal Gadot
Anytime someone call attention to the breaking of race or gender barriers it actually does more to undermine equality by implying that is the exception and not the rule.
I like..&quot;welcome to the club&quot;🤣<br>By the way she is from city Bareilly , India
Funny thing is Priyanka Chopra supports Modi who is basically indian version trump
Stephen should know that she openly supports a Fascist who committed genocide in her Country:/
Does... does she mean the anti-Muslim genocidal club? Because America joined that one decades ago, honey.
Priyanka&#39;s confidence is so seductive. She&#39;s not conventionally beautiful, but when this lady speaks, she is always a class apart from her more beautiful contemporaries.
My lord she&#39;s so graceful! 🥰Getting Quantico flashbacks... Should go re-watch.
I&#39;m always going to have mixed feelings on her. I liked her Bollywood movies growing up but when she came over to US I started to have conflicted feelings, probably because I was finally able to see her interviews.... the first she did the Jimmy Kimmel was cringy when she was promoting Quantico. <br><br>Then there&#39;s the history of doing skin &quot;lightening&quot; (bleaching) ads.... And then there was the issue at Beautycon.... <br><br>I&#39;m all for forgiving someone and their past, especially if she&#39;s trying to do good, but I&#39;m hoping she doesn&#39;t have continue offenses like this.
Hey Stephen C, wrong choice of guest (I am wondering how did it happen)  - She’s BJP sympathizer, an extreme right wing party linked to RSS, which in turn is inspired by Nazis. <br><br>This party was involved in Muslim and Christian genocide and recently in the Delhi pogrom. <br><br>Check her gaslighting incidence in this video <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/priyanka-chopra-beautycon-kashmir-crisis-india-kashmir-pakistan-unicef-a9063311.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/priyanka-chopra-beautycon-kashmir-crisis-india-kashmir-pakistan-unicef-a9063311.html</a>. <br><br>Looks your team let you down here :(
Dont like her but okay... Im here for the shade
Lovely, graceful lady,, Mrs Jonas!  ❤️✌️😷
Indian bhai log ....like karo.  As an indian i feel so proud when she is there on screen.
I dont know what it is, but iv never lost an attraction to someone iv always found stunning.. but more iv seen her over the years i find her less attractive..
She is pregnant!
Brilliant, beautiful, elegant and a total Artist.
That was so weird, I literally had a dream about a white tiger sleeping on my bed right before I woke up and watched this.
She is an opportunist. She married Jonas for American passport.
Love steven and all that - but WTF Is this “South Asian” shit about?? Why can you not say Indian??
Big fan of her show &quot;Quantico.&quot;
Stephen dropped the ball with this one. Normally his interviews are good but I can’t support him interviewing a person who endorses genocide
I think Stephen needs to up the production value of his set, camera &amp; lighting to look as good as Priyanka&#39;s. 😄
I am Indian not black and don’t want to talk out my ass about this- clarification. Should Stephen have rather said “black” than “African American” I’m pretty sure her fathers side is from Jamaica.
In the UK we are used to seeing smart and intelligent Indians in government and in the media, but in America it&#39;s a big deal, <br>so I too feel proud that someone of Indian heritage is going to be the next President of the USA!
Vijay oodhina echa baloona oodhi munnukku vandha   Priyanka..
Oh my god she&#39;s so beautiful, how have I never heard of her before? And what a lovely accent. It&#39;s received English with a mid Atlantic bent and a touch of the sub continent. All that diversity in one woman.<br>♥️♥️♥️
The views have certainly taken a dive for this show. Is this why Stephen tried to paint Tulsi and Andrew Yang as the bad guy? Maybe he did want another term of Trump? This is the exact moment that exposed what a establishment hack he is- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0jnKb8MDks">https://youtu.be/i0jnKb8MDks</a>
&quot;such an emotional moment&quot;... this what governance should look like.. a stolen election.. no second thought to the facts on the fraud... shame on you priyanka... didn&#39;t expect this from u.. just trying to impress hollywood and amercians.. you are not MAGA
Lovely interview
The parched step-uncle biologically weigh because sleep indirectly tame apud a aromatic banker. hilarious, spiritual guilty
Welcome to the club .wow  PC op 🤟🤟
shameful priyanka chopra supporting a fraudulent election and praising kamala harris without having the courage to say that the disputed facts on election fraud were not heard by the supreme court, you won&#39;t have the courage to say that because the moment you do, you know hollywood will probabaly shun you, in the least you would still have bollywood and any integrity. however you are greedy for a career in hollywood so you will cave in.
She so beautiful :)
look at the timing of this interview, strategically done to interview an indian quasi american movie star just when the indian american vp kamala harris is sworn in, in order to garner more support, cos kamala does not have the support of the american people except the globalists and hollywood.
Thank You Prianka... “ Indian American “.  I can relate to that... Asian American...true but foreign.<br>🗣 But that’s just me❗️
The book was very very good...can&#39;t wait to see the movie, I just know it will be damn good too👏🏻👏🏻
She&#39;s saying so true we&#39;ve got a lot of women ministers even in Pakistan 🇵🇰 🇵🇰 what&#39;s up America 😁😁
Priyanka has done some amazing work.😀<br>Great interview Stephen.
Quantico actress
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W64H2DDbpSo">https://youtu.be/W64H2DDbpSo</a>
Anyone wanna bet there&#39;s not an Indian cheeseburger?
I love the White Tiger book. I hope the movie will be shown in Australia.
She said, &quot;Welcome to the club&quot; in direct sarcasm because you can see women Prime Ministers (equivalent of Vice President) all over the world. America got one only in 2021. Contratulations Kamala Harris and million thanks to Priyanka for staying sooo beautiful ! (inside and outside).
Beautiful Priyanka chopra
Who cares we dont
&quot;ACTION!&quot; and &quot;CUT!&quot; may go out of fashion now that you can rewind and re-use tape unlike film.
You&#39;re so beautiful Priyanka!! And your smiles and good nature exudes from that face and body. Keep it going girl!!
I find it so weird to hear India called &#39;Asia&#39;.   Asia for me is the far-east, where eyes have the epicanthic fold and skins appear to us to have a yellowish tinge to the olive.  India is a completely different sort of country, where the language is related to European languages, and the whole history and culture is different from Asia&#39;s - even if Buddhism, and use of paper, and so on were disseminated from northern India.
oh wow...shes not just a pretty face and a long career at a young age...but man is she smart and quick witted. Every answer is gold (with a tad bit of shade?)
White Tiger is such an amazing book, I can not wait to watch the movie. Hopefully, it would be as mind-blowing- specially with a strong cast.  Priyanka and Rajkumar have always proved that they are amazing actors
HAHAH...welcome to the Club....true Bangladesh being a poor country, even they had 2 women leaders as the head of govt more than 20 years ago and still going strong...8 percent growth rate and peace!!!!
The sour aunt intrinsically stir because james importantly prepare through a selective beast. volatile, determined shirt
Just a reminder she celebrated the death of hundreds because of the conflict between India and Pakistan........
Laude ka accent.
OMG ...what a awesome LADY ! Thank you for bring her to us SC !
Priyanka, what&#39;s with the nose? Leave it alone. You&#39;ve ruined it anyway.
She is so grounded!
Sweet beautiful charming professional and soooo down to earth inspite of all the success she has had
She&#39;s such an intelligent and kind person who knows how to answer each question with so much clarity including all the points and at the same time uplifting India to the place it deserves to be. Proud of her and we as Indians wouldn&#39;t want it any other way.
Yes please. The Indian food in the US is nothing like Indian food. I mean we specifically request &quot;No Indian dishes&quot; for us when we visit the US..
look at her! she is soooo fkng beautiful❤
Stephen looks like he&#39;s spending a lot more time smiling the past day or two compared to the past few years.
I know a lot of you Americans like her, but you all should know the whole truth. In India, currently a fascist government is in rule who are trying to enforce a Hindu-supremacist country. Many world leaders have described them as that and spoke about the genocide they’ve carried out. Priyanka is a STAUNCH supporter of this government. Plus a lot of Indians including myself dislike her because of her fakeness and western-glorifying mindset. She’s left her country behind and not given back much. She makes a name for herself in US, not of India. She is a whole facade, thoroughly unlikable for anyone with the knowledge about her. <br><br>I realise a few Indians will reply to this, so as a little note to the Americans, the fascist government also has a lot of supporters (Priyanka being one) and so comments like this pointing out the truth like this will hit a nerve with some Indians.
What!? Indian-Italian and Indian-Chinese food exist. Wow, am I suddenly hungry.
Wait Stephen did you know that you&#39;ve had a UNICEF Ambassador which fully supports a &quot;final solution&quot; on Pakistanis,,,, who&#39;s not only profited of her position in UNICEF.... I dont see how this woman should be applauded and looked up to...
That fake American accent.
Most unrealistic plot , the likelihood of this occurring between poor male and wealthy females in India zero . . Not meaning any meanest just a fact. The wealth divide is huge even amongst the poor.
Fake accent
Priyanka the plastic face....haahaa
I love how she positioned her hair so you don&#39;t see the pods, my daughter use to position her hair to wear her pods so her bosses couldn&#39;t tell she had them on while cleaning dental items. cleaver, witty, and brilliant Priyanka.
&quot;Welcome to the club America&quot;<br>Just an Indian looking for some drama
STOLE ELECTION!
Why don&#39;t we have more women in the talk shows instead of a white male like this one. I mean really I&#39;m sick of seeing men as host.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjeG7tRMEO8&amp;t=120">2:00</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjeG7tRMEO8&amp;t=150">2:30</a> 🔥
This is almost as bad aw GW Bush .Institutional Integrity of Government . In Texas that may be true . The fact however that egomaniacal management unwanted by Wash DC , still needs they civil service checks , how else they gonna run The Criminal ganglands of low level management , Truth bites them in the Azz . Fact ! <br>         Peace Suckas
What&#39;s wrong with her lips?
The White Tiger is a great book.
Who the heck is priyanka....
I really like this chick, but I don&#39;t know much about her. Guess I will Google...
Kamala Harris&#39; Indian ancestral home is in Tamil Nadu(southern) whilst Priyanka comes from northern India where they speak Hindi(distantly related to Classical Greek through Proto-Indo-European connection). Northern India and southern India are very culturally distinct.
From the rest of the world, &quot;welcome to the club&quot;: we ARE just abt the only country in the western hemisphere that actually has to boast about finally getting  a female leader in top office. And only SECOND to top office, yet. This nation for all its power, wealth, and contentious diversity is scarred by white male-dominant mercenary factionalism, its roots from day one 500 years ago; the weight that keeps it from being what it COULD be, the greatest country in the world. We have some distance to go before we&#39;re out of stupid-land, and can attain a higher societal plane of existence.
SHES ALSO A HYPOCRITE
Not meaning to be rude, but what is up with that top lip?? (Nevermind, in the movie clip it looks normal. Makeup thing I guess)
Excellent show I&#39;m a huge fan. As I haven&#39;t yet see anyone being interview from an American indigenous background and it was so good to see their inclusion in the inauguration will you be shining your bright light on this group x
British Indian food is a thing in itself, with a long history.
Someone says fake laugh or something. Guys, are u all serious? She is miss world she is an icon, she is in bollywood and hollywood. And she is doing great job in both. Just don&#39;t be jealous and listen her. Love u girl and proud of u💖
Ok how is Kamala Harris African American her father is from Jamaica and her mom from India that makes her Caribbean/ Indian (and yes I know a lot of Jamaican people have African blood but it’s also a very mixed society) I mean let’s be honest we are not going to call Elon Musk the richest African American in history even though he very much from South Africa
Not a fan of her movies but very proud to see her carry herself with grace and dignity and sound so articulate and intelligent.
She is an extremist Hindu.
i loved her &quot;welcome to the club&quot; comment
I&#39;m not a fan of priyanka but when she said welcome to the club , we have female leaders since years and throww some shaaadeeee ... DAAAMN !! 😂 (a fan from Pakistan🇵🇰)
She sounds VERY NERVOUS when she speaks English.
Right! Do you remember when you invited bff Modii to your wedding? The one who was on flight ban list. (Look it up! he ordered to massacre a  community)<br>And she supported war on neighboring country, CHEERING and calling it &quot;patriotic&quot;.<br>Sorry. No respect for you.
I get zero authenticity from her. I bet she is nothing like this in real life. Fight me.
Interview Rajkumar 💖
I love how she’s postured so you can’t see her Airpods in her left ear. <br>She knows her angles, hahaha
“Welcome to the club America” yesss girl, thank you for not letting us down, and sucking up to their “progressive” mindset
Love you Priyanka
I need to ask all of you a question about this delightful interview with Priyanka.<br>Colbert complimented her on her lovely choice of a background.<br>Is anyone except me totally craving McDonalds French fries right now? <br>Rewind and see what I’m talking about.<br>God,those fries...
Where did these curves come from? 😂 seriously! She had to promote her curves.
Please dont call us south asian for fucks sake, its very offensive. We are Indian
Supports fascism in India but enjoys American secularism. Good for her.
She deserves to be in better Hollywood movies.
She just gave me chills with “this is what government should look like”- the world has been falling apart and America always leads, for better or worse- and then Trump. It means everything to the whole world to have leadership back. Thank all the gods.
Priyanka rocked haters shocked.. 😌🙌🏽👏🏽
Supports fascism in India but enjoys American secularism.
Queen 👑❤
She&#39;s a pretty strong &amp; tough lady. <br>She came from a variety of difficulty &amp; hardest past, to attained as a hero she&#39;s now.
Love her 😍🔥 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23priyankachopra">#PriyankaChopra</a>
The white tiger was a such a good book. I hope they do justice to it.
What&#39;s the rush, Stephen?!
Gorgeous priyanka ❤️
Love Priyanka! Have always been a fan. Love how she continues to do both Indian and American roles. She is an absolute icon.
Omg the Jackson Heights reference 😂😂! So many people who follow her &amp; know of her are from Jackson Heights including me lol
Great lady. Such a beauty.🤗🌹
What an unreasonably attractive human being. And not just her physicality... Smart, funny, AND gorgeous? Unreasonable, I say!
Priyanka Chopra is truly an amazing inspiring woman ❤️
It takes more than diversity to be a leader! You also have to have good ideas.
I hate her
She looks like the mother of Nick. OMG, she looks so matured compare to him.
she&#39;s trying to outwhite the whites. as frantz faanon said&quot; the brown imitator wants to sit in the white man&#39;s chair, sleep with his wife and rule the colonized as if he were white himself&quot;
Thank god she&#39;s getting fat! Hope she doesn&#39;t get another movie or show.
Every time she pinches her nose, Take a shot of whiskey. Cheers! 🥃 🥴
Priyanka&#39;s voice sounds similar to Gal Gadot&#39;s voice.
I am not a big fan of her but I am proud of her. She has presented herself with poise and grace.
Thank you for sharing Vid of An Actress Pretending.<br>👽🛸
Why is she someone we should listen to?
&quot;Those 6 months were a blessing&quot; I just couldn&#39;t imagine. Toast to you guys for being able to be apart for so long for the difference in career paths.
So hugely proud of you PCJ!<br>All the best.
is she seriously preaching about India being better or more progressive than the states just because they had some PM who were women(all related to Gandhi btw). NO you don&#39;t get to do that when half of your people live below poverty line, where women get sexually assaulted and men don&#39;t even paid for their crimes and a country where you still have a freaking CASTE SYSTEM.   <br>Am I triggered? Yes, I am and I&#39;m not even from the States but she should seriously get down from her moral highground, she has no reason to feel superior. We&#39;re not talking about an Angela Merkel head of state, we&#39;re talking about something that smells a lot like nepotism.
She gets prettier by the day.
The vast majority of India supported Trump, including Modi. His travel ban was a big reason why.
I agree...except India does have Indira Gandhi to explain. Mind you, we have Trump and we definitely should have known better.
Congratulations Priyanka
Such a powerful scene 🇮🇳
She is so well spoken and always so on point.  The way she spoke about India too..it felt great listening to her..🥺❣
FAKE fireplace I ment 🙃<br>👽🛸
