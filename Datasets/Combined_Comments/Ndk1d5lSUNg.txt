<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=77">1:17</a> was when the guy yelled “YO! GET OUT!”
@Jaypatel<br><br>You knew there was an active tornado warning, and you still chose to stand under a glass window, during an active tornado warning, instead of going to the airport&#39;s basement?
Standing that close to a window during a tornado is like holding a grenade right up to your face as it explodes.
What tidal wave of intelligence possesses these people to all be standing in front the endless floor to ceiling glass panels during a tornado warning, that is, until a frantic announcement incites panic among the entire sheep herd???  This is another shining example of reasons not to follow the herd, keep your senses on alert during adverse weather, and learn to trust your own instincts while always thinking ahead.
“This tornado was proudly sponsored by the airport”
Pandemic/
Ngl, they delayed/cancelled all of the flights because of an oncoming tornado.
I was waiting for the glass to break like in Final Destination (2000).
When the employee said &quot;Yo get out&quot; it sounded like they wanted them outside the whole airport...
It looks like they’re underwater
Yo my dad was in this tornado on highway 170 he was in the torando
wow🤍
I can&#39;t believe anyone on this thread would have known it was a tornado if they were in that terminal. Give me a break.
Nicole, did it ever occur to you they had no idea it was a tornado at the time.
HELP WHY WERE THEY RIGHT AT THE WINDOW.😨<br>THE OKLAHOMA GANG IS SITTING OUTSIDE FR😭
City folk in the airport..I can&#39;t believe they didn&#39;t realize what was happening until they told them to take cover..All looking out of huge glass windows.
its funny alo kids laughing
Dude I knew it was a tornado before everyone started getting loud. It’s pretty obvious when it gets dark really fast.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=65">1:05</a> walter
Look at everyone laughing and giggling looking through the glass window... 🤦‍♀️
why was it so chill until that guy yelled “get out” and then everyone started running 💀
I lived in STL at the time and was supposed to fly into the airport that day. Our flight was cancelled so we flew into Kansas City, rented a car, and drove home from there. <br><br>We were blown away by the extreme damage that we saw when we got into town. My brother also worked at the airport at the time, so he was in the mix of all this craziness when it happened. <br><br>He took shelter in the building, so he was ok. I remember some people were trapped in a plane on the tarmac though. Must have been so scary for them!<br><br>But none of this holds a candle compared to what happened to Joplin, MO 1 month later...
By the time all these people got downstairs the tornado had probably passed, but it obviously didn&#39;t damage this part of the airport. Other areas had broken windows and more.
The kid going closer to the window must be a complete Buffoon to go on the window like that, it’s a tornado and this kids just “mommy look ! Rain!”
&quot;OH my gawd&quot; like what? 🤣
Tornado rips through nearest town. Everyone: calm<br>Tornado is pretty much over and a guy screams &quot;GET OUT&quot;. Everyone: panik
Darwin Award contestants.
Hope no one was on one of the planes there... •~•
Seems like an overhead announcement might have been a good idea at some point.
Never underestimate women to make a situation worse than it needs to be. and you want equal pay lol
Wow! I&#39;m surpise those people didn&#39;t realize that was cleary a toranto look at the swirling winds around it and the debris.
I live where there&#39;s more Hurricanes than tornado&#39;s but this past early spring I got the alert sound on my tv and my cell phone in that robotic tone: &quot;Tornado in Your Area Seek Shelter Now!&quot;  My mind could hear the freight train bearing down on us ( I think it was a prolonged thunder ) I had my cat&#39;s carrier out ( from all the Watch and Warning time ) to shove them in to go to an interior bathroom.  In a direct hit,  we&#39;d at least all get sucked up and die as a family huddled and hugging.  But the alarms on the tv and cell scared my chubby female Siamese and she&#39;d gone waddle bolting to the next room.  I was laughing so hard trying to catch her and shove her in the crate.  My black fluffy my male cat ( her brother ) eyes were wide open and so was his mouth.  When I&#39;m laughing like that I have zero strength.  I guess If it had hit us directly I woulda died shoving cats and giggling like a nut ball.  A few minutes later it turned north and dissipated.  A fun time was sure had by all.  I&#39;ll skip it next time. &lt;3
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
People screaming… bruh stfu and just move
Guys, let’s take a moment to appreciate how efficient the evacuation system works. “YO, GET OUT!”
Humans are dumb
It seemed &quot; Get Out&quot;!!!! Scared them more than the tornado 😅😅😅
Screaming fursure helps in those situations
For 11 years ago this is good quality video
That’s a drico happened in ottawa this year
So this video was posted 11 years ago i say its joplin tornado
WHY DID EVERYONE THINK IT WAS OK TO STARE A TORNADO IN THE FACE BEHIND A GINORMOUS SHEET OF GLASS AND NOT ONE PERSON FELT A SENCE OF URGENCY OR DANGER ?!?
Did you see the country folk start leaving the windows before the crowed did lol
Nice way to start a panic
With all the smart phone technology that&#39;s out there, if things start looking sketchy where you are just download a weather app and take control of your personal situation instead of waiting for someone  to tell you.  Had it been an EF4 or 5 none of those idiots would have survived.
Oh my gosh 😱
All these fucking women screaming like fuckjng chicken like shut the fucm up or gonna smack you face you werent screamijg a second ago now because one rando yells get out u start screaming
I would have been scared as hell to go on an airplane after seeing that! 😰
I kinda wanted the people with their nose pressed against the window to get it. Have you no inner warning system? Like even a mild sense of uneasiness that might make you saunter over to the other side of the room?  Doth everyone need to be spoonfed an official emergency response? Sheesh
this guy SEES the wind changing &amp; just STANDS there &amp; does nothing
Getting out was stupid. They’re safer inside the building
Anybody else just watching a bunch of tornado videos?
When in the midwest always check to see where the storm shelters are.
High IQ people for sure.
Scary DAMN IM GONNA HAVE BAD NIGHTMARES
<b>If anything woud hit this big window the amount of falling sharp glass coud kill a human</b>
This is San Francisco:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE5k28lB6Oc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UE5k28lB6Oc</a>
Just leave them to get sucked out the windows. The world&#39;s full of idiots that we don&#39;t need.
Thanks for showing and warning everyone to Never go to St. Louis. If idiots like that are there... no thanks.
I saw this on a tv show, and I got really shocked when I saw this for the first time
Tornado: 🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪<br>One guy: EVERYBODY OUT 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️<br>Everyone Else: 👁‍🗨 👄 👁‍🗨...|... 👁‍🗨 👄 👁‍🗨...|...👁‍🗨 👄 👁‍🗨...|...👁‍🗨 👄 👁‍🗨
Imagine a big foot of Godzilla in front of that glass 😂
My dad chased this storm. Wierd day as like a damm 3 year old. He was like 2 miles away in a Ford pickup truck.
Literally a tornado in the airport: <br>Me: we are all going to die.
Hey Charlie, I’ll bet you a coffee I can clear the entire terminal within 10 seconds.
Humans 🤔?... A big glass wall and a tornado 🌪️ staring at them and they are takn pics 🤨. Honestly how stupid are some people?
Is this the same storm that went through Joplin?
Go home!! Stupid ... fun is over ...🤦🏻‍♂️😡
Its A Dark And Scary Night
The flights are really delayed now from the tornado 🌪 at St. Louis airport
I always go to the building with the biggest windows during a tornado.......for the view
<b>Look, a tornado! Now lets stand near this giant WEAK GLASS window with a plane infront of it!</b> (So stupid)
Good thing the power is still on.
Yeah, yell omg panic the F out of everyone 🙄
Obviously they were frightened looking out the window but still just stood there watching. You noticed the mood change too once the wind hit, the sounds outside and things everyone started looking out the window.
omg
f4kingggg stupiddddd people they are recording when the sky is coming down lasssyssssss
<b>Yo get out!</b> stands for.... Get your dumb asses out of here!!!
So where is the best place to stand during a tornado?
Que miedo 😦😦😦
Yea I wouldn&#39;t need anyone telling me get out seeing those huge glass an knowing what would happen if it breaks I&#39;m out not waiting around for that
Tornado on one side. Godzilla on the other. What a dilemma!
Everyone suddenly when he says &quot;everyone get out&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6mh45mA_JY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6mh45mA_JY&amp;ab_channel=LaurentRIVIERE</a>
Let&#39;s all video severe weather until we are told to seek shelter then panic and get chaotic. 🙄 It was clearly severe weather regardless if you didn&#39;t know it was a tornado, and those are dangerous as well. People terrify me.
hysterical
Before yalls go I like to thank today&#39;s sponsor called NEW RAID SHADOW LEGENDS
Too many blacks
Screaming helps
I thought the glass was going to smash. Bummer.
2012
The Spirit of St. Louis
Why do women feel the need to start screaming the second they feel uneasy? STFU and move along you loud mouth.
100% still people complaining for delays
Remember do as I say not as I already done
The 3 don&#39;t in tornado encounter 1 don&#39;t stand near a window 2 don&#39;t drive a car through a tornado 3 don&#39;t go kite flying in a tornado or you will be that kite!
People standing by glass windows were raised in Chicago public schools.
I&#39;m convinced these people are npc&#39;s
I was supposed to leave in the morning on Southwest flight to San Diego. It was our first family vacation by flight. Unfortunately, my flight was cancelled and I was stuck calling reservations in the middle of the night trying to get another flight out. We ended up driving to MDW Chicago to cath another flight out.
Siempre tiene que haber una mujer loca que empieza a gritar y crea panico cuando no es momento de panico.
Lol
“Everyone go to the side with more windows please”
Yelling and people start screaming..
Tornado: IIIIIM HEEERE 🌪🌪 Passengers: Everybody to the window 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️ 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣
Unbelievable that a lot of these fools had to be TOLD to literally get TF away from the windows and basically take shelter. 🤦🏻‍♀️ They should have done that on their own. At least some were smart enough to do it before being told to. Lol
Id be crying like a little child if that happend to me
Thats why i dont afraid of group of people, they become stupid when they are on the groups
Listen we&#39;re built different in St. Louis. And by that I mean we&#39;re fucking stupid
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=66">1:06</a> A few wise folks saw what was happening and said, &quot;Oooup, peace out&quot;
Могли бы и дальше продолжать &quot;ржать&quot; как лошади🤷
The idiot who came in yelling at everyone  to get out in an aggressive tone, made the situation a lot more stressful for everyone there. The last thing you do during a tense situation is to yell and be chaotic.
Tornado: Come to the window i have something awesome to show you<br>People: cool ok  (bolt straight for the window)
Let’s only get away from the glass when someone shouts to do so 🙄 Seriously, it’s the first thing you should do with these kinds of weather conditions.
Ride ride....
Same in Orlando
Some people are idiots like common sense stay away from windows even if it looks like a regular thunderstorm . I swear
There was no warning about what kind of storm it was until it was too late.
The black lady and man are totally unbothered! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=52">0:52</a>
The mf in the comment section talking about how it’s weird to see people without a mask are so fucking cringe
Listen to all the dramatic ass women scream for absolutely no reason after the guy says “YO GET OUT”
Idiots. There’s no hope for us. Where’s my beer….
Yo! FOOLS
Tornados are the worst type of storm in the world 🌪🌎🌍🌏
I love the people are like : Mm lemme get close to the windows and take a pic!
the guy did a very good job preventing panic 😁
Was there any damage, just curious...a lot of scared panicked people...? One guy yelled fire and they all scattered, could have trampled some people to death...!
not even gonna mention the totally fucking unnecessary HYSTERICAL screaming when the guy yells &quot;get out&quot;
More Like to Shouted: TORNADO!!!! RUNN!
people in that state YO GO TO CANDA
Do you think there was a weather delay on flights?
Right to left inflow. Just might be a tornado.... The left would just blame it on COVID
I&#39;ve never been in a tornado, but the moment I saw the rain changing direction I&#39;d have been looking for a tornado shelter
&quot;yo, get out!!&quot;<br>Crowd:&quot;yes thank you, we almost forgot to start running and panicking!&quot;
The moment before he yells the clouds looked like they were in slow motion…..terrifying 🌬
I love how most people didn’t even know it was a tornado, unless you knew what a tornado looked like, you’d just think your looking at dust flying
imagine if the airplane getting sucked in
I would probably get my carryon into the nearest bathroom
I don’t know if it was this tornado but when I was younger we are going to go to my grandpa that lives in Missouri close to St. Louis or in St. Louis I don’t remember but out the plane couldn’t land because it’s tornado destroyed the  airport I have no idea if it was this though
Let me just say STOP FUCKING SCREAMING IT&#39;S ANNOYING AND DOESN&#39;T DO SHIT!!
These people on another level I would of moved long time ago they must think airport windows are indestructible
Sa fait peur la tornade , cher moi a l&#39;île de la réunion on a pas sa , mais on le ciclone  😨
Run for ur liferre make some stamp pid people n good luck
When the rain started blowing around, my reaction would&#39;ve been to get away from the windows and get to shelter!
Ah yes the constant laughter of us humans as a tornado comes right for us 🇺🇸😄
If that glass would have broken, then those guys would have air travelled without a plane.
I worked at the airport before and we had a tornado maybe 5 miles from where we were at but we were able to feel the heavy wind. A lot of people started recording the tornado, some people were standing on the window seal then everyone started freaking out once they sound the alarm for us to go underground. Honestly the airport is the safest place in case a tornado hit. We went down maybe 5 floors so we were definitely safe if it ended up hitting the airport
ヘタに騒ぐと、ダイハード２みたいに。🐙ﾜｯ。
Woulda been cool if suddenly all the glass windows had blown out and the &#39;nado started sucking dozens of people out into the sky, including the camera person, and then later on they found his phone and uploaded the stuff to YT.
Premonation
Amazing that no one was trampled to death.
Watching them stare out the window until they panic and run reminded me of several famous photographs that I went all the way to the big island of hawaii to see.  One picture shows people lining the sea wall in Hilo Bay to watch an approaching tidal wave.  The next picture shows the people only running away at the last moment. The  last one taken showed numerous bodies floating around Hilo town because most of it was below sea level.  These pictures were taken by a man in a tree who survived.  I’m always surprised by the lack of preparation by people in a dangerous area.  What took so many minds to see that death was so close to them.
<b>Get out!</b><br><br>Honey don’t <b>GO</b> outside unless you’re the window watchers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=159">2:39</a> ... typical St Louis accent.
Attention. Attention. Please can everyone gather by the huge glass windows
The tornado was sponsored uninvitedly by Southwest Airlines.<br>Tornado: thanks for letting me take the southwest jet :)<br>Airport: you are certainly welcome <b>sarcastically</b>
It was si beautiful but so deadly
I swear why is it that women are the ones always screaming and panicking and making it more stressful for everyone there...You can even hear other people shhhing them. The dude yelling go get out is also a idiot for not trying to keep the peace and keeping everyone calm.
Mental health is essential to be able to live in a country and the world NORMAL educated civilized Mental Health WISE salvation blessed by GOD HAPPY paradise on earth IN CONCLUSION CONSEQUENTIAL God through the Holy Spirit helps us to learn that we can reach this wonderful state MENTAL HEALTH WISDOM IF AND AFTER WE REJECT OURSELVES WE DISCONNECT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SOUL OF LIFE WITH EVERYTHING CONTAINED BY SATAN OF ALL SINS AND WE FULFILLLY FULFILL THE 10 DIVINE LAWS AND THE HOLY TRUTH WRITTEN IN THE HOLY BIBLE
So did anyone notice the 2 ladies worried about their frozen drink for the show ?  Lol .<br><br> Maybe they knew they would be parched after the run to safety  after they realized  this real life. Lmao <br><br>Where is they guy who got on the speaker and said it&#39;s time to run for those who in awww... he needs to be crowned as a hero he saved so many lives. Lol
👑👑👑👑
Oh wait a second I&#39;ve got something in my eyes ,yez you do a broken wind glass
That&#39;s crazy no one tries to take cover, it&#39;s funny until it gets real, smh
This tornado was an EF4 that traveled over 20 miles across the St. Louis metropolitan area. It struck this exact airport (I’m guessing VERY shortly after the video ended). It ended up causing 250 MILLION dollars in damage. In other words… it’s a miracle nobody you’re seeing in the video died (The tornado caused 0 deaths and 5 injuries)
Legend has it those people are still there waiting for their planes. 😂
Ama Ama Ina Please please help us to all People Amen Godbless Jesus name 🙏 Amen ama I&#39;m prayer for us lord lord Jesus name 🙏 Amen
love how the panic only sets in when the guy of staff  yells “Get out!”
This is the most ridiculous video I&#39;ve ever seen.
Nice job freaking people out, knuckle head!!
kk tão em choque com um ventin americano é troxa demais
Hope their planes were still there
That airport needs remodeling. Great way to do it. A void  this airport if you can
I love weather, love tornadoes, but I hate airports and planes so worst nighmare to be anywhere other than home during a tornado....The screaming is unnecessary 😑 first of you don&#39;t need to to UNNECESSARILY yell or scream bc that causes UNNECESSARY panic. Just move fast and don&#39;t linger. That&#39;s how people get hurt or die.
Todays tornado has been sponsored by American Airlines. Please fly again!
Listen to all the women start screaming and of course running in fear.
I swear all women can do is scream
I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t evacuate earlier.
Yeah, I was working at a clinic south of the airport on Lindbergh near Olive when the tornado hit the airport.  While we were rushing to get patients to safety, we could see idiots driving north on Lindbergh TO the airport- to watch the storm.  JFC.
Tornado: happening<br>Kids and families at the window: 👁👄👁
this video title should be &quot;my recording of the back of people&#39;s heads at the airport.&quot;
That’s near my house
I am dead. The delay of people reaction. I would have been left. Not today. Lol
I flew into this exact GATE when I lived in Missouri, the BR was there, everything...it&#39;s insane
What happened?<br><br>Ummm, there&#39;s a tornado outside and your nose is pressed up against a glass wall, ma&#39;am...
It&#39;s amazing how slow these people are during a tornado
Yeah because standing thrre staring at a tornado is going to stop a tree limb from flying through the glass
I will never understand the human inclination to film amid danger rather than seek cover to spare their life. We are truly the only animals that will outright ignore our instincts.
I aint seed no tornado.  Lyin out thay asses talkin bout thay a tornado
It&#39;s a shame how they looked right at it and had to be told to get out and go for cover. People need to learn to pay attention to their surroundings and not take anything for granted.
Everyone goes down stairs acting like they&#39;re gonna be safe. Tornado: Uuuhmm...I can destroy that too.
Love the sign on the lower level that says &quot;Your Journey is Just Beginning&quot; lol while there&#39;s a tornado approaching
That is glass!!<br>Ahhhh!! What u people doing
Wait till someone yells to move then start screaming... Yeah that&#39;s gonna help
and ide be like &quot;cmon kids lets go&quot;
It only took one guy&#39;s yelling for everyone to move. Power of fear.
I was there tsa evacuated us to first level baggage claim area by stairs, no flights after it.
Stupid idiot yelling screaming get out caused a panic
I really wonder what people were thinking standing near the windows.  Not any sense!
I kept shouting at the screen “GET AWAY FROM THE GIANT WINDOWS YOU FOOLS”
Accept for the odd adult loosing their shit, for the most part, I&#39;m impressed with how calm y&#39;all acted evacuating to gain more safety, while props to security and possible volunteers also. Excellent and well done to all.
Everyone is calm......... then some dude hollers &quot;GET OUT&quot;. Then women start screaming, people rushing everywhere...chaos ensues
wth sub to the jay channel right now instead of not subbing and watching 9M times wth just sub to them ugh
Man: &quot;Get Out! Get Out!&quot;<br>Lady: &quot;What Happened!&quot; 😑😳
Why will people just watch it out the window I&#39;d be out in a heartbeat .
adoro como o ser humano olha com vontade direto pra morte e só se desespera quando alguém grita pra sair
The screaming never helps 🤣🤣🤣
Maybe tornado finally cleaned that airport up of its backed toilet problems.
I don&#39;t get how they don&#39;t realise that&#39;s a tornado right there they had to of been blind the wind was swirling side to side people in Missouri should know what a tornado looks like by now this is ridiculous I live in Missouri and have done my research and want to be a meteorologist this shit baffles me I see some people saying there could&#39;ve easily been warnings about tornadoes but if this was a night tornado then you have jack shit knowledge in your brain it&#39;s hard to put warnings out for something you can&#39;t see people of Greensburg know this and in joplin there weren&#39;t very many warnings because the weather looked perfect during that day maybe not perfect but you get the point and the supercell formed and tornado came out swirling like a bitch and killed people and destroyed the town
What a bunch of idiots lol
Uhhh why were people just sitting there, watching the tornado? WTF is wrong with people.
Standing in front of glass window lanes during a tornado?  People are so stupid!
Yea these folks definitely aren&#39;t from the area...they should&#39;ve boogied outta there about 20 minutes ago lol
Emergency manager: &quot;Should I stick to the &quot;ladies and gentleman for your own safety please move away from the windows and to the inner part of the building&quot;-script, or should I just yell &quot; yo get out&quot;... ?
Why are they next to the window and not in a tornado shelter??
I like the sign,  &quot;Your Journey Is Just Beginning &quot; above the escelator
Thank goodness  the airport employee  understood  the assignment.....
could you imagine if it destroyed everything and the last thing you saw was a big red sign your journey is just beginning lmfao
The blond lady standing right up against the window filming though...I just can&#39;t believe she had no sense of danger right there..
Now the Godzilla steps in...
&quot;YO GET OUT&quot; tornado blaring full force on the windows &quot;what what happened&quot;
Everyone was just chilling like ooh tornado and then one guy was like GET OUT and then everyone started panicking. Like they didn’t know that was a tornado before
Goes to show how sheep-like the population truly is. Bunch of morons hanging out near huge windows in am obviously dangerous situation.  Only until someone yells &quot;get out&quot; the clueless masses behin to migrate lol. Truly collectively idiotic.
This could’ve been handled a bit better than a guy yelling “GET OUT”
Anyone crying hey why my flight delayed
Moms, make sure your chIldren enjoy the show pressed up against the windows! 🤦🏻‍♀️
There always has to be that one or two frantically screaming ladies who do nothing but cause panic.
Tornado 🌪️<br>People:- nothing<br>YO! GET OUT <br>People:- <b>panic</b>
0.38  The dumbest group of people I seen in a long time.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There soo lucky to have survived  this tornado EF4 wow
Midwestern people are just built different.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=80">1:20</a> Panic Mode.
Parents really let their kids by the window 🤦
Get out! That’s the cue for the screaming women 🙄
Hi, I just wanted to say that God loves us, His miracles are real just keep trusting Him and don&#39;t stop praying. Godbless you all😍
Oh look it&#39;s a tornado let&#39;s take a selfee at one of the big glass windows .
Bro, does this remind anyone else of the airport scene in final destination 1
Look people are dumb as dirt 73 million voted for orange obese orangutan malignant narcissistic psycopath !
LOL, as they&#39;re going down the escalator, I&#39;m reading the sign &quot;your journey is just beginning&quot; and &quot;take off&quot;. Not exactly what I want to read with the potential of a tornado coming.    pretty calm evac otherwise.
Anyone on the runway?
Look at all the maggots run <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=93">1:33</a>.   What a bunch of idiots.  Next time, let them all stay by the windows so they all get sucked out and blown away.  Will do society a huge SOLID
By a window that’s so smart , not
11 years back was staying at a hotel across the street, mesmerized by the flatness of the land, thinking &quot;Jesus, the wind has perfect freedom.&quot; Storm hit that night that at home back east would&#39;ve been an 8 or 9. Most intense lightning I&#39;ve ever seen. Hell of a show. Guy having a smoke out front was surprised. Said for out there it was a 4, tops.
The stupid bitch that screamed hahahahah
Get the fuck away from the windows, dillweeds!
Moronic humans in their natural state of retardness
Sigo pensando que las guerras son los más horrendo que el hombre puede provocar (y otras cosas), pero la naturaleza deja pendejo a cualquiera! 😱💩👍🏻👍🏻
This is the same guy who yells fire in a movie theater.
Great idea to sit next to a window...
Ahahahahaha. All the people just gawking at the horrible tempest outside and only started crying like petulant children when told to move inside 😅😅 wtf id wrong with people
Was there anyone on those planes
Sheep: bah bah bah.  Sheep dog: “GET OUT!”<br>Sheep move.  And you wonder why Biden became President.  Sheep mentality
May 22, 2011 for ya
I just love how they&#39;re right in the windows.. 😳
Me who lives out in the country and experiences crazy storms all the time: &quot;That looks like a tornado, better get farther in and away from the windows.&quot;<br><br>The people staring out the windows: &quot;Wow, that tornado sure is getting close!&quot;
AMEN 🙏
I was impressed at how orderly things moved along, and it seemed like from the vantage point of the camera people stayed calm and things went relatively smooth!
if i was there i would be praying
some guy (probably very handsome): get out<br>outside:
them folk sat there the whole time lookin at it then when somebody say get up and get out, yall start screaming 🤣🤣🤣 lordt your people need you
&quot;Storms are getting worse due to global warming&quot; but strangely everyone seems to have forgotten what its like to be in a bad storm
People are so stupid. It amazes me sometimes. They&#39;re like wild animals only dumber
Dumb people lol . Let’s go by the window and look at the tornado 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The people next to the windows must not be American. Otherwise they&#39;d know. If you don&#39;t know what a tornado is then why would you have common sense about them?
Get out we had one in Georgia
So stupid by this men who say &quot;GET OUT&quot;. It’s normal that everyone has a lot panic…
...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=132">2:12</a> “your journey is just beginning “<br>Or just about to end
It&#39;s fascinating really. I watch so many disaster documentaries and one common theme is the refusal to acknowledge what is happening. People will literally die before they want to acknowledge danger. They just want everything to be &quot;okay&quot; so badly, they refuse to accept that everything is not okay. You&#39;ll see it again and again. If you wish the danger isn&#39;t really happening hard enough, maybe it isn&#39;t? Sadly....
I&#39;m glad nobody got hurt.
Yeah, I&#39;d probably drive after that
Note to self. Do not stand in front of a giant wall of glass when it looks like a tornado is moving in!
So a wall of windows and nobody is thinking of the wall of shrapnel that could possibly kill them
And if airports aren&#39;t chaotic enough, here comes a tornado, &quot;You don&#39;t know what chaos is!&quot;
Any event no matter how big or small : <b>happens</b> <br><br>That one woman : maybe if I scream and cause panic things will be okay?
People are so .....dumb!!! Looking out the window in a tornado 🙄
Its scary to know all these people are so stupid  to just stand there and watch ,dumb dumb ,I a least would have headed to the bathroom.
Always a white woman scream like she&#39;s being ...🤫🤫🤫🤫🤐🤐
Haha why are people screaming after the man said &quot;get out&quot; they weren&#39;t  screaming before  as they were pressed against the glass like idiots. Lol
Tornado: <i>In the process of engulfing the airport.</i><br><br>The people standing by the windows: <b>&quot;It is what it is.&quot;</b>
The employee of the month Mr. Jonathan Knohow, by studying a month in advance for this exact situation.  He was able to help everyone move quickly. <br>When asked what was going through his mind at that terrible time? He simply responded &quot;It really helped me to think of my mother in law,  who moved in just a month ago &quot;

Everyone just casually waiting in an airport acting like the tornado is not there...<br><br><br><br>Hey that looks like a familiar situati-  oh yeah I ignore my problems then run away from them too
After surviving an ef3 i wont ever take a tstorm for granted again
&quot;What do you mean my flight is delayed?&quot;
Ok why the hell are they operating during a tornado?
&quot;yes! Let&#39;s all stand next the windows!&quot; I&#39;ve would&#39;ve saw that been gone
Just watching this and hearing the wind whip made my heart fall out my ass, idk how these people could just sit here and stare through windows no less
👋🏼
The flight attendant on Spirit Airlines:<br>“We’re in for a little bit of rough air as we take off. We hope you’ll sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight!”
IDIOTS
Wow! I’m stunned 😳 these people don’t miss the chance to capture “viral” video footage even if you’re standing next to the tornado 😂😂 Ha ha the herd needs thinning… desperately.
All passengers final call for flight 00-1
<i>hello darkness my old friend, we’ve come to fuck ourselves again</i>
STAY AWAY FROM WINDOS!!!
Tuvo que salir el seguridad, qué pasa no ven nada anormal
I sat there for like two minutes wondering why they weren’t getting away from the very large long, susceptible to breakage windows.
Why did the man say out there?
Scaryy
I love how everyone collectively stands up when the rain formations start looking odd.<br><br>I bet they didn’t even realize that the plane started inching towards the source of the wind when it turned all strange looking.
The people: 😐😲😳😨😰
As they all panic and are told to go down below deck because of a tornado and right above that stairway where they’re running down a sign says “your journey is just beginning” <br>Ironically scary &amp; funny.
Running and crying after your dumbass was standing infront of giant windows during a tornado
Man I was at the airport 11 hours ago in STL
Imagine the people who aren&#39;t familiar with tornadoes seeing this. European people, Australians, west coast people.
What is it with girls and screaming? Nothing bad even happened yet and even if it did.....what is with the screaming?
forget about the tornado for a second, doesnt anybody know when its lightning to never stand near a window??? it can strike through windows, our couch got lightning struck with me setting in it jfc<br><br>please never stand near windows looking out during a storm with lightning, if you need to check the weather look quickly and then get away from it!<br><br>also freaks me out that i heard people laughing during the time they were watching...i would be seeking shelter tbh
They weren&#39;t warned earlier!!!!
Hey everyone let&#39;s wait til we see a tornado before we head to the shelter... Idiots
That tornado is huge 😣 when I went to a airport to go to California that legit happened I was so scared. But when I saw people leaving it looks like they left because they saw the tornado and they had to take shelter to protect their selfs
People are dumb. They are all calm and as close to the windows as possible like morons...then when staff tell them to go downstairs they start screaming and panic. <br>Is their no balance? An in-between of common sense? Maybe not smooshing against the windows assuming safety..instead of only freaking when staff round them up. <br>Good grief 😔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=83">1:23</a> Karen There Is No Need To Yell 🤣
The stupidity of people never cease to amaze me. They only run when someone yells get out?
What nice communication during a natural disaster &quot;YO GET OUT!&quot;
We are sorry but the flight to Florida has permanently been cancelled sorry for the inconvenience and hope you come back to travel with us soon
I suppose they all had to go back through TSA screening again afterward.
Naturally the kids think it&#39;s the best thing ever lol
Really!!  Nobody would have had to tell me to get out.   My behind would have been gone the minute the first wind rolled in.  Why would someone have to tell them to move it?
I’ve never experienced a tornado but surely you don’t sit right by a window , when there’s extreme weather
It’s beyond common sense to move around to safety l, I would just left them silly ppl there just bc it don’t make sense to be that senseless. Yes keep staring at the thing that turning 🤦‍♀️
We need to gather all these people and study them. Either they are super brave or super stupid.
هاؤلاء القوم، لا يعلمون بأن تلك الضاهرة الطبيعية، هي من خلق الله تعالى اللذي خلق الطبيعة و خلق كل شيء. هم يضنون بأن هاته الضاهرة من الطبيعة. السؤال لهؤلاء؛ ومن خلق الطبيعة. أليس الله ؟
Well that looks like a flight delay.
It took an employee of the airport to tell these people something they should already know?  Wow.
I know, let&#39;s press our faces against the big glass windows and look at the tornado! Yes, that&#39;s much better than moving into the interior of the building away from glass and under a structurally sound place.
Cannot get over how people was looking out the window. I&#39;ve never seen a tornado but I know stuff flys around in the air that can smash glass.
for real...nobody noticing this? i getting the fuck away from all the big ass glass right now!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=87">1:27</a> That dude sure has a way of calming people down.
WAS IN A COLLEGE DORM IN ILLINOIS ONCE, THE TORNADO STRUCK THE SIDE OF THE DORM,<br>SHEARED OFF IT&#39;S TAIL...THOSE BUILDINGS CAN TOLERATE A LOT OF ABUSE...
I wouldn’t be sitting near the bloody window
What idiots that have their toddler children hanging on the windows with a tornado outside smh
2010년대 미국감성 좋았지
It was storming and it was bad. flash flood warning and tornado watch. a gust of wind blew my neighbors back door open and my fence was leaning and it tore my shed into pieces.
Isso é poder de Deus tem que levar as coisas mais sério isso não é brincadeira não 😂 tem gente que vê essas coisas eu fiquei brincadeira ficar rindo 🤣 pedi a Deus para ele cessar as coisas tá o mundo inteiro 😂🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
People can be so dumb sometimes. Let’s just get closer to the window a d wait for a baggage cart to come through and hit me.
I would NOT stay close to the window in this situation.
I thought he yelled &quot; Get down&quot; so they all headed down stairs...
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=135">2:15</a></b><b> That sign that says &quot;Your journey is just beginning&quot; is really NOT a good thing to see during a tornado! 😂 LOL</b>
<b>OH SHIT! A TORNADO at an AIRPORT!?? 😲 I bloody hope no planes got caught in it while landing! Of course they&#39;d have cancelled every flight taking off from St. Louis, that night. But still, if I was there, I&#39;d have been shaking like a leaf!! 😀</b>
Unprepared.. where were you sending the people. I believe, yes the best place is away from windows but also a secure place is in the corridors between gates where there no windows. Glad everyone was safe. Thank you Jesus. My mom was in a bombing at one of the NY airports. Very little instructions...just not prepared...but praise God He sees and knows.
I wonder how many airplanes were damaged during this E4. Must have been scary for any pilot near the vicinity.  Crap, that was really tense, sitting near those big ass glass windows looking about to shatter.
So stupid the people near the window in a fucking tornado, a lot of brains...
Mm yes let’s stay right up against the windows 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ hope everyone is alright though
These people have clearly never seen final destination
Huge concrete building seems pretty darned safe until Godzilla starts stomping around outside.
Those are some of the dumbest people standing in front of all that glass
Crazy to think that this is almost 11 years ago, I remember hearing about it on the news and watching the video about a month after it was posted.
I never understand the use of glass buildings. They are fragile compared to brick and mortar and prone  to damages easily in harsh weathers.
That&#39;s very close to a glass window
Stać przy szybie nagrywać i myśleć, że mi się nic nie stanie... ludzka głupota czy naiwność?
That shout of &quot;Everyone panic!&quot; was so professional
I&#39;ve been in the same airport in February 1984 when a major snow storm hit and the military flights to Korea was shut down for 24 hours.
Employee &quot;Yo, get out!&quot;<br>Me &quot;to frigging where?&quot; <br>Genius having giant windows in any building wheres theres tornado&#39;s! SMH 😖
To sit in front of those hugh windows is just stupid!
When the tornado is 2 feet away from them , now they move
I’m surprised the windows didn’t shatter.
Dude! Ain&#39;t no way in hell I&#39;m chilling by the window while it looks like the end of the earth outside at night.
Man are people stupid
It may sound rude, Yo, get out go to baggage claim.  He was trying to get these individuals to safety. Tornadoes in the US are life or death situations sometimes.  They had to get away from the windows, the windows break and strong winds can pull people out sometimes.
The other   video. Of the windows blowing out much better than this sorry azz video  🥱  yawn.....
First sight you see that run why you wait to get yelled at
Sza be like: oh well now I’m going to the airport
I wish it didn&#39;t, but I guess this justifies a lot of the stupid standing around and watching that extras do in disaster movies. We should be smarter than that, but we simply aren&#39;t.
Poor, duh-dumb sheep. They don&#39;t react until someone with a brain tells them to.
Everyone looking at the storm: “Haha this is fun!” <br><br>The guy urgently tells them to get out: <b>SHRIEKS OF TERROR!!</b>
Everyone staring out at the tornado. Someone yells, hey that&#39;s a tornado. Everyone panics and screams 😅
BLM!!!!
As a tornado scardey cat, WHY IS THAT SO COOL?!?!
Gojira!!!!!!
避難コール馬鹿かよ<br>焦らせてどうすんだよ
Sure, stand close to the huge glass windows and watch the tornado! 🙄
They sure waited for the last minute
Y&#39;all just stand next to the glass an wait......<br>Until instructed to move..<br>Stupid
Ofc some bitch gotta be hollerin lol
Those people with their faces against the glass.
Only stupid people would stand by big window and film while hugh and dangerous storm is outside. What morons!
The screaming makes it more worse😂
Always a few obnoxious women who have to SCREAM AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE in any tense situation
Stupid sheep starting to scream and create panic over nothing when they could just form a line and quickly get to safety ...god i hate us humans so much
アメリカ人ってバラバラなのにこう言うときは横並びで行動できるの好き
I&#39;d have been out of that room the second I saw any sign of a tornado
The most annoying thing I could hear right there would be screaming from people that aren’t even in real danger
Tornado: it at the airport<br><br>People: let’s all go stand next to the windows for a better look
Is that Lori Lighfoot?
Excellent work on the staffs part

Exactly how you <b>DO NOT</b> want to start an evacuation.<br><br>They are lucky they didn&#39;t end up with a stampede on their hands.... Like FFS get on the intercom and calmly announce that due to inclement weather everyone needs to leave the departure area.... Not just yell <b>Everybody get out!!</b>  <br><br>Dumbasses.
Чёрт, торнадо - это же новый вид транспорта в аэропорту! :D<br>&quot;Вас приветствует Tornado Airlines! Добро пожаловать на борт! Всем хорошего полёта!&quot;
yes, lets just ignore that this video was released 3 days before the start of the 2011 Super Outbreak
Get out to where? It´s a fucking tornado outside.
Not laughing anymore 😂😂
This is why we don’t know about Area 51. People will freak out like the security guy . Get out lol
Fuja loco fuja!😱
My plane was on the tarmac during this. We were moved 10 feet. I didn&#39;t realize what happened until I got off the plane in Denver and there were 25 text messages on my phone asking if I was alright.
Why were those dumb people approaching to windows??
&quot;oh mom look, there&#39;s a cool tornado out of the window&quot;<br>One guy  says&quot;GO BACK INSIDE!!!&quot;<br>TOTAL PANIC
Sont vraiment cons les gens! Danger imminent mais c’est plus intéressant de filmer!!!
Сидели себе спокойно как торнадо проходит<br>1 самый паникер:бегите мы  все умрееем <br>Ну и началось
Nada haver mas me lembro do residente evil que os zumbis caíram do avião e invadiram o aeroprto.
This is why people died. Not because of the storm but because of their ignorance and stupidity.
Umm. Is it me or were those people standing up against those Large viewing windows....DUMB AS HECK?!
不懂？誰來解釋
修学旅行の時だったら絶対楽しいやつだ
Can&#39;t fix stupid. Not even with duct tape! Let&#39;s stand real close to the windows!
Some people didn&#39;t listen (or didn&#39;t have) during tornado drills in schools and it shows. Immediately starts screaming and panicking.
Why airports need direct mass transit connections (subways in particular, because underground)
Beeeeeeehhhh
I dont get why those people were like.... chilling? Especially those NEAR the glass window. They&#39;re literally in the middle of tornado, yet they&#39;re watching as if the glass window was a television. Even worse, they even taking pictures?
These people are idiots. What do they think that glass is shatter proof and the building is tornado proof. Plus what parents let their kids sit by the windows like that.
Those people going up to the window to look at the tornado are the same as those people in Thailand who walked out to the ocean when the water receded before the tsunami drowned them.
SRUOGjhFb443u90rtzhr
FUCK!!!!! I just spent 30 damn minutes getting through security. If I get back up there and I end up getting pulled aside for another &quot;Random&quot; security screening again, I swear to God someone is getting punched in the dick. Screw you tornado!
Ah life at airports without masks. Those were the days
Call me sexist, I don&#39;t give a fuck, but hysterical women screaming annoys the everliving shit outta me and is a huge reason why I will never see them as equal
Everything was fine until they were told to get out. Leave it to a couple of idiots to start screaming.
Everyone…..MOVE
All those assholes looking by the Windows lol
I don&#39;t know why people have to yell loud. It&#39;s only make the things worst. And they all made videos chill like a minute ago xd
where is it?<br>in the cinema?
They were all sitting like idiots laughing away in the background wow
People are unbelievable…it’s a tornado, so let’s stand and look out of this giant piece of glass.
Tornado outside: hey kids go stand over by the windows so I can take a picture of the tornado behind you
Еще ничего не случилось, а некоторые бабы орут, как идио..и.
O
Is this what they call bystander effect or stupid?
The sheep did listen.
When the shit started to go down, what do you do? Go to the window to film it..... if I saw something like that, I don&#39;t go towards the window, I go AWAY from the window. Some people did, but most just stood there like a herd waiting for the slaughter.
Жуть!
Действительно настоящее стадо... Точняк колоть таких надо и чипировать.
Dump
That goes to show you how people really just sit around and watch a disaster unfold and will not move. I would have been gone 😂
Oh didn&#39;t know spiderman&#39;s friend Ned works at the airport.
I don’t see tornado
I thought the reflection on the glass was the tornado at first and I was thinking all these mfs about to die 😂
The airport has no announcement system in case of a tornado? It&#39;s not like weather would be an important thing to monitor AT AN AIRPORT OR ANYTHING.
That must be one strong ass building
Like final destination airplane scene 🥶
yo get out
How fragile we are i love it
I take it flights were cancelled then?
It&#39;s a miracle the tornado seem to have blowing away from the building.
I am Egypt p and c
Umm... Get out where exactly???? Out in the open?!
The lady bringing the Starbucks &quot;omg did you hear the world was ending Karen? At least we have our coffee.&quot;
lmao idk why everyone be starin outside the window when it give in at any moment....
Was war da jetzt 🤔🙈
The tornado 🌪 in the meantime, made a smooth landing , 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Here in 2022😅
SO slow to react its almost as if they want something to happen to them, the level of interest in continuing their lives is like a two out of ten
theres always gotta be that one screaming panicky woman
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=68">1:08</a> lmaoooooo, that one lady recording by the window with her phone
Get the hell out of there
I was just a few miles North in a motel. That was a really strong line of storms. That tornado was bad.
Bruh, these guys working here are killing me 💀💀
The US looks like a shithole
I was wondering when someone would come and sound the alarm. Can’t believe how many people were up against those windows! 😱
Employees : USELESS<br>Travelers:  IQ zero. Stand in front of plate glass windows, in a wind event likely to break windows.<br>Conclusion:  not a lot of brains in Missouri
This couldn&#39;t possibly be the worst time to get this recommendation as I got a tornado watch warning on my phone thankfully I&#39;m safe and sound
Get out BRUH!!.
Don&#39;t you just love all the people who get to the bottom of the escalators and stairs and then just stop, blocking the way for everyone else 🤦
&quot;Yo, get out!&quot; is the perfect emergency directive to give those who hadn&#39;t figured that shiit out for themselves already..  which was nearly everyone... plus everything in the US always plays out like a cheesy B-grade movie...
?
Northern US Folks: Look! Out the window! Isn&#39;t that cool?<br><br>Southern US Folks: Aww Hell No! (*proceeds to seek shelter*)
The usual idiots screaming ….
Yall wanted to see the windows break, cmon now
Can we please confiscate the camera from that person? Back to school before attempting to film again... 🙂
What a frightening tornado.
Nature’s power is scaring
Wow remember the good old days before covid and wearing mask
&quot;Yo, GET OUT!&quot;<br>Jordan Peele: Write that down! Write that down!
<b>DISLIKE</b>
You would think the airport would start moving people before the wind kicked up. They have radar.
Weird. They only panicked when they were told to panic.
Boring....Nothing happened....nothing broke....This sucks!
Good thing the rona wasn&#39;t present at that time
Are the people in the airplane ok?
At this time I was smol
Silly humans
I was waiting for someone to yell out, PANDELRIUM.
People love feeling like they&#39;re in the movies , with the dumb looking grin on their face 😂
They’re lucky that beast didn’t blow that plane right through those windows.
In these moments evening the hard core atheists suddenly start remembering god.
&quot; Everybody remain calm. Please just remain calm.  No need to panic. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO STOP A TORNADO?&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=1">0:01</a> you see that kid in the white shirt walking to the window? I do that all the time!
There you go.  Push your faces up against the glass, you window-licking goobers.
Bêêêeee
Scary as he&#39;ll am I right
I’d be out of there as soon as I saw the wind get faster,
To be honest I would have stayed at the window too out of curiosity unless my instincts kick in to get the hell out of there.
people need to learn to tell thier kids stay away from the  windows!!!! when you loose them its too late.
&quot;YO GET OUT&quot;<br>Very Professional.
We crack our self’s up. Oh look a tornado let’s look out the big picture windows. Omg
왜 이동하지..
Quickly! Run to the OTHER glass room!
All these people and their &quot;possesions&quot;
This would be me”Woah Y’ALL FILM AND GET POPCORN”
Supervisor: Ok Guys lets be cool about this we don&#39;t want to scare anyone...<br>Worker: YOO EVVVERRYYYBODYY PANNICC!!!
How to panic
Rule of thumb, if theres any natural disasters, just stay away from glass windows, hanging ceilings or from doors.
LOL -- GET OUT! lets just start a panic situation.  This is how people get trampled.  Though, they really should have started leaving.
Another title lie. There is no content here. Why even post this? 1min of wind blown rain, normal occurrence nothing exciting. Then 2min of people walking to a safer area. I was told there would be an airport tornado in this video.. New accurate title: People watch rain Then you watch people.
What a time too live, no one had to wear masks then
Japan: calmly moving around. <br>Rest of the world: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH RUN!!
People who immediately start screaming  are the worst.
I CAN&#39;T  BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE WASTED TIME JUST WATCHING THE TORNADO OVER THEM, INSTEAD OF RUNNING FOR COVER.
I remember this tornado. First tornado I had to take shelter for. Me and my family live around 10 miles from Lambert and we were taking shelter in the basement when the tornado hit Lambert Airport. I was in 6th grade and I had never had to take shelter before so I was absolutely terrified. Fortunately, everyone&#39;s safe and now I don&#39;t get scared when we have to take shelter for a tornado warning. But this event was cutting it close in my opinion.
How... do you stare at THAT and not take the hint? The second things start to look abnormal, I look for a safe place to be. Not stare at it like a doofus and go &quot;ooooooo ahhhhh wow looooook.&quot;
Everyone sits there looking at it<br><br>Guy yells get out then women start screaming <br><br>😆 should have been gone not sitting near the huge glass windows come on people.
Bigass windows in a raging storm.. common sense would tell people to move. But common sense may not have tornadoes in their state.
Have they ever tried their PA SYSTEM?
I’d rather walk....but thanks anyway!
The next Final Destination should start off with a scene like this.
It took for the dude to say 3 words for panic to set in. Meanwhile, everyone had their face pressed to the window Lol! ‘Murica 😂😂
So proud that they used so many windows in a place known to get natural disasters that can easily destroy them.
All these people probs just started finale destination 6 irl🤣<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Jk
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=66">1:06</a> u see natural selection in action. Truly riveting 🧐
Of course people are getting closer to film the &quot;experience&quot; - everyday I lose a little more hope in humanity
Where&#39;s the tornado ?
The windows stood against it
Employee: &quot;get out!&quot;<br>Me: &quot;alright bet&quot;
That wasn&#39;t a tornado 🤦‍♂️. Clickbait title.
Panic only creates more panic
Respect to the peeps who saw the winds change direction and scooted out of there without being told.
GUARDS: CMON LES GO <br>EVERYONE: NAW WERE SAFE <br>1 MINUTE LATER EVERYONE IS GONE AND THE GLASS BROKE <br>GUARD: WHERE IS EVERYONE <br>OTHER GUARD: THEY PROBABLY ESCAPED HURRAY
theres always those few annoying people that scream and shout  and just create more panic
Stupid people sitting at the windows just watching. Never go near the window during a tornado. That’s tornado 101
In a situation like this, please do not go anywhere near a window! Please think safe...
I&#39;ve never seen a tornado this close before and why was this person filming before? Anyway, we could have this moment at least!
There&#39;s always that one fat girl screaming louder than everyone else in situations like this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=116">1:56</a>  good sheep
They were fortunate that it wasn’t a very powerful tornado.
Yo get out gets the job done!
Stupid people
That’s awesome that the terminal held up during this.
I would’ve stood by the door slapping all the stupid bitches who are screaming
THE AVENGERS 🤩
Everybody was so amazed he said get out everybody panics🤣🤦🏿‍♂️
These people are clueless
I can&#39;t believe a warning was not issued
As soon as I saw those clouds forming I would have started shouting &quot;get away from the windows! They will F&#39;ing break! Move!!&quot;
Karen is still wanting to speak to the manager.
I just seen people running. Didn&#39;t see a tornado.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=84">1:24</a> why are there always two or three women who start shrieking in every situation?
People laughing in the background. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
i now understand the movie scenes where danger approaches and human is just standing there, going towards it even. we sure are dumb eh?
Way to panicked people into a Frenzy
Not nice to watch at all
Karen: excuse me why is my flight being delayed?
Imagine if that happened after you already boarded. Yikes!
&quot;RUN FORREST, RUNNNNNN&quot;
The idiots at the windows... Smh
What a horrific moment for everybody. Imagine being stuck in St Louis😱
nearly every American ever, watching all hell break loose until it’s their problem
All those people no mask wow all virus spreaders wait till they return home
I mean they were way too calm for me
Why are people soo stupid!?  You only start moving away from the glass when someone has to tell you🤔
Airport Staff: Now Frank we don&#39;t want to cause panic, we have a Tornado coming please ask the passengers to get to safety calmly...<br>Frank: YO GET OUT!<br>Passengers: OMG RUN WERE ALL GOING TO DIE!<br>Airport Staff: God damn it Frank we said DONT cause a panic =/
GET OUT EVERYONE PANIC IN A DISORDERLY LINE GO
If you see something like that developing outside large glass windows at an airport, don&#39;t stand there gazing at it or videoing it.  Get out on your own.  Use your head.
I love how they reacted only after the tornado had practically passed 💀I think the fact it didn’t immediately bust through the entire airport says a lot as to why nobody immediately panicked. You would think a tornado directly on top of you would be a bit more chaotic than that.
It’s enough an idiot to create panic.
No intercom? No notice? They have radar at this airport right?
Ok...what even happened? Clickbait video.
It’s crazy how they were all laughing and filming and then the man yelled and they start screaming
The tornado...
Isso foi a 10 anos atrás, e só tem comentários atual. 🤷‍♂️🤔
Everyone: sitting by window calmly<br>Airport employee: Yo, Get out!<br>Human reaction: scream
they&#39;re just standing there
Were was the tornado? Did I blink and miss it?
They probably couldn&#39;t tell that it was a tornado, just saw sheets of rain and crazy winds, and just thought it was a wicked storm. I imagine there was a lot of people that wasn&#39;t from around there, being that it was an airport and all, and many probably weren&#39;t from somewhere that gets a lot of tornados, so they might not have understood what they were looking at. Also, they might have figured that they would be notified by the people working there, if there was an emergency of any kind, including a tornado, which they were. Maybe not the most professional way of managing the situation, but the people working there were probably in panic mode once they realized there was a tornado right outside, too. They are just human, after all. However, even if it was just a bad storm with sheets of rain pouring down and crazy winds (but no tornado), I personally wouldn’t just sit there with my face pressed up to the glass watching, mesmerizing or not. My anxiety would tell me to get the hell away from all of those floor to ceiling windows, asap.
I&#39;m not even from Tornado country ir even seen one. Maybe a waterspout.<br>But I&#39;m sensitive to changes in the weather so juat by looking at how unusually dark the clouds are and the way the rain is moving in a strange way.....my first thought is LEAVE
Where&#39;s the tornado ?
Thank goodness for the guy that yelled at everyone to move to baggage claim. Amazes me how humans can stare danger right in the face and walk up to it with eyes full of wonder <b>massive face palm</b>
Jfc does noone listen to the warnings on their phone about weather?!
Tornado: Yall better have them frequent flyer miles ready.
I&#39;m a New Yorker and this would have freaked me out.
Literally causes of stampede and panicking tssk
<b>THE GLASS WINDOW PEOPLE WOULDVE BEEN ME AND MY FRIENDS LMAO</b>
The biggest danger to everyone was the moment the idiot screamed &quot;get out&quot; causing a terrified panic and risking a stampede. Clueless!
Ahhh filming instead of running...&quot;Yo Dawg ! Yo gonna die! &quot; .... Please walk do not run and stay calm.....😵😵😵
Final Destination?
geeeze! create some panic why dont you?<br>aaand of course beaches gotta start friggin screaming. which does absolutelt nothing but scare the children and create more panic.
I feel for the staffs that&#39;s working on the Tarmac
That&#39;s one hell of a way to scare the crap out of everyone .
I bet no planes were canceled that day, like they are now
😥the peoples are near the glass .
This is why natural selection is so successful
Glad someone in charge had the ball an the brains to get everyone to a better location. The morons standing in front the wall of glass taking pictures on  were all about to get lacerated.
Only in America
Quick honey , take a picture ! !
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=77">1:17</a> panic mode
Não era Tornado, era uma Bros 150 kkkk
Meanwhile everyone is chilling and as soon as he says, “get out!” someone starts screaming in panic. Lol! Some people are just weird.
What a bunch of dumbasses.
I was wondering why they allowed the people to be staring out the window like that!! How foolish was that?
ohhh yeahhh!!...ORDERLY PROFESSIONAL &quot;MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE&quot;!!💯💥👌👍yo bro...ON D FLOOR...NOW!! (d crowd stop laughing)🤣🤣🤣🤣👌👍👍
They came in yelling like spider man “GET THE FUCK OUTTA THE WAY I CANT SEE!!”
There was intense lightning strikes while I was in the sunroom  yesterday. It was so loud. Lightning blew a tree all to pieces right infront of my house
Yo get out?! I&#39;d have laughed in that dude&#39;s face. What a buffoon.
Microburst Tornado.
Reminds me of the airport scene from Godzilla  made in 2014
The women..that high pitched scream of terror..is not really helpful or necessary
What trips me out everyone saw what was happening and no one moved until the guy yelled.  Standing by all that glass gee wiz
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=80">1:20</a> literally shows people are sheeps and panic easily. whats with the screams? nothing was fucking happening.
They looking at Godzilla or something…
I would never fly with weather that bad. They all seem nonchalant.
Love how ppl laugh when they are possible about to die
Americans, so fucking dramatic! 🤦‍♂️😂
This easily could have had a different ending.
Lets all watch a video that is uneventful and very similar to a regular busy terminal....
This proves that many people are sheep and need to be herded. They didn’t move or scream until their shepherd told them to. 🤦🏾‍♀️
lol
Anyone with common sense knows to always stay away from windows when theyres a storm, this just uped my anxiety
LMAO talk about sheep. It’s like not one single person screamed until somebody let them know they are supposed to. It was like, “OK time to scream now! Let’s go crazy for the video!”
De las risas al miedo<br>Definitivamente las emociones humanas son un paradigma
That get out guy sounded like he knew what the fuck was going on
Idiot!
They are literally standing right next to glass walls.
You can always rely on that one female to be screaming for no reason
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=137">2:17</a> &quot;your journey is just beginning&quot; suddenly sounds vastely different when you&#39;re seeking shelter from a tornado
At that point I’d rather be in the plane than the airport
i love how the clouds move like if the tornado is starting to form
Only a fool would stand in front of a wall of glass windows during a tornado
Why did they scream telling them to go out?!! First thing u kearn is to stay calm and evacuate the crowd as calmly as u can, its coordinated with many staff,everyone knows what they should do and guide the crowd!!! Never saw a staff in the airport scream at people even in a dangerous situation!! Weirdos
“Your journey is about to begin.” Yeah from that 🌪
Everywhere else in the world:- &quot; we need to keep everyone calm to prevent a panic stampede that might get people trampled to death&quot;<br>America:- &quot;YO GET OUT!!!&quot;<br>Tornado:- &quot; AANNND ...ACTION!!! WE ARE A GO, GO GO&quot;
All these people must have been from Missouri. When you say hey is that a tornado and everyone says, huh well  let&#39;s go to the porch to see.
Well that was a boring video.
Espíritu de san Luis
Wait what is that say I thought I
Guess they aren’t flying for awhile lmao
Me like 😳 so they are just going to stay and watch huh.
Midwesterners would see this and know best not to be near any windows
All I seen was a bunch of idiots looking out the window like it&#39;s some joke 🤣
Idk why I laughed when I read &quot;Your journey is just beginning&quot; while there&#39;s a tornado right outside
Christ! The comments, both new and old, on this video are extremely moronic.
Society&#39;s safeguards keep the stupid people safe; shit starts going sideways, the dumb people are usually the first to die.
Now I know when they say YO GET OUT then that&#39;s a tornado 🌪.
Yo, Get Out..... That&#39;s their evacuation plan ?
It takes someone to tell them to move.  Geez!
did they SERIOUSLY  need to be told to take cover? How DUMB are they? No one yelled about their rights to be smashed by a tornado while they were ordered to reach safaty?
I love the woman who was standing inches from the enormous window filming with her camera.
Terrifying. Looks like the end times. Almost biblical. Very scary
Ya just let your kids sit against the glass like that lol wtf. I’d be freakin out
Dont people know the rules of when u see a tornado that means stay away from windows ect. And evacuate also these rules were taught in school
Love everyone wearing masks
Tô achando engraçado que a mulher que tava vê seguindo no bar de bangu hoje tá aí ao fundo falando , me causou problemas e deve ser da família do Bolsonaro e se.ela não parar de agir como uma hiena além de eu matar ela com acidentes imprevisíveis terão vários koreanos e alemães que me ajudarão a torna a vida dela impraticável em aeroportos
That’s a big ahh tornado like if they were inside of it it would have been rlly big bc that’s a big building
Fun fact about tornados.. if youre staring right at it and it aint moving. It&#39;s moving straight towards you. That&#39;s when you should leave. Not stand and watch like these people. Hope everyone got out fine.
Grita mais e mais que vocês vão ver vocês todos mortos por mim ..
Grita mais
Não vai viajar ...ria mais e tenta arrancar meu cabelo daí que eu mato mais vocês.
Não tenho dinheiro por que vocês roubaram aí
Ria mais que eu mato mais
I Will not leave them travel and i kill ALL the airplanes workers
Expectation vs Reality: - Expectations: &quot;For your Safety Please proceed quickly and orderly, back inside the airport. Do Not Panic.&quot; - Reality: YO GET OUT!!! &quot;Aaaaah!!! O my God!! Aaaah!!...&quot;
This has got to be the stupidest group of people.
Kind of looks like a scene where you would expect Godzilla to show up!
I mean your not going to be “may I please have your attention, calmly move to the interior ….” In a moments life or death situation. I mean common sense people.
Are you rounding up cattle or people??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=131">2:11</a> look your journey is just beginning
Imagine a guy is in the bathroom taking a shit. Comes out, EVERYONE GONE AT THE TERMINAL 🤣🤣🤣
We’re any of those people thinking they were traveling by PLANE through THAT?
Crazy, literally just had one touch down about 2 miles from my house tonight here in Arkansas about an hr ago
Why didn’t they Take shelter<br>Right away?
My 1st time flying was in a little 6 passenger plane..it was storming out&amp;that plane was all over the place..i had sweat dripping down my arm was so scared!! They were so nice&amp;helped me to big plane to make connection..never flew again..😞
Women always screaming!! Just take it for once.
Oh yes great weather to fly
Whole lotta nuthin&#39;.
Guess the ones by the windows wanted a free flight
Soooooooo.  I&#39;m assuming that the glass did not break and the roof was not torn off;  and everything ended up being fine?
This is the beginning 😅
Телки визжат как дуры ,нет чтобы идти спокойно и не создавать панику
Looks like during a movie showing at the theater. The movie flickered off /on and they told us to move into the hallway because of a bad storm. I went &amp; looked out the big front entrance &amp; it looked like this😬😳&quot; Yo, get out!&quot; Where does he expect them to go?????
Stupid people let’s watch!!! IDIOTS!!! Now 🏃‍♂️
Nothing like yelling fire in a theatre
Well I wouldnt get close to the window when theres a tornado, cuz it might break soon and you are going to be the first to die
I don&#39;t understand.  So they&#39;re being told to &quot;Get out&quot; of the departure room with the huge glass windows and then they&#39;re corralled to the arrival area with huge glass windows AND a glass ceiling. So....where is the safe place to &quot;Get out&quot; to??
The lady screaming and freaking out was probably quite helpful and reassuring to everyone there...good grief
I must be a tornado magnet! I&#39;ve been in or really close to them in three different states, NH, SC, VA. Weather or not you survive depends on location, location, location! All the ones I went through had no warnings!
Wow.Very nice☺️☺️
The fact that I was in St louis and 2 months old at the time
You idiots!! Get away from the windows!!
Good grief you wouldn&#39;t have had to tell me to get away from the plate glass! What&#39;s wrong with some people?
GET OUT GET THE HELL OUT
Isn&#39;t it the object not to make people panic? That guy yelling clearly didn&#39;t help.  And to the people screaming for no reason. Grow up. It clearly was not the end of the world.
I watched this video a while back to see how people in an airport responds to a tornado or if planes can fly during tornado
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=26">0:26</a> All Okies would have been hauling azz to the bathroom to storage area....always follow the Okies
Welcome to the midwest 🤣
I love bad weather
Damn sheep sitting by the window filming it with no sense of analytical thought to action. But then when they are ordered to evacuate they start screaming and panicking.
Idiot sticks just sticking around watching it . . .
Where&#39;s dorothy
People don&#39;t get panic at all, and try evacuate the place 👍
who the hell was screaming...omg calm down your going to start a freakin panic
Life was so normal before Covid 19
Phew in Russia all ok
I don’t think I’d have gone to any airport if a tornado was around
Airports know what is going on with the weather. Curious as to why there was no PA made at all. Just the SWA employee coming out of the jetway yelling &quot;get out&quot;. Great job STL.
nah i think this is just the disney ride &quot;soarin&quot;
People who scream are so dramatic lmao as if a tornado is going to collapse an airport
&quot;oh, a tornado, let me just stand right here at this big window&quot;
If you didn&#39;t catch it, the guy shouted out &#39;Gen Z, start screaming in a typically self absorbed and over emotional way NOW!&#39;
He needs some basic customer service training 😂😂😂
I feel so scared for the people in front of the windows because what if the tornado broke the glass and you could get hurt  by the glass  or get sucked out into the tornado and die 👱🏻‍♀️😬🪟🌪😵
Damn, get your kids away from the frigging windows.
Wondering what would an f5 do to a structure like that
&quot;Your journey is just beginning&quot; and &quot;fly off&quot; really hit different.
Why are you by a glass window?
Wait until the last possible moment of danger then scream ‘get out’.  They need a better plan rather than a hick screaming at the end....
I was raised in Tornado country and I&#39;m amazed at the sheer stupidity of sitting in front of huge glass windows!During a 🌪 Tornado.....And the fact these people needed someone to tell them to move it!Like a bunch of dumb sheep!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=81">1:21</a> lol he shouts “YO GET OUT”
Dude I just wanted to get something to eat at Burger King :(
That guy: “GET OUT” <br><br>That one person: “wait what happened?”
Imagine everybody running and the speakers come on<br>&quot;Sorry flight 284 may have to be delayed due to the airport getting destroyed by a tornado&quot;

Anyone else binging tornado videos?
Anyone else kept watching for the plane to see if it would fly away or be blown against the building? ò.ó
God why not give a proper announcement? Terrifiying
Why is there always at least one person screaming, especially AFTER the crowd is told to evacuate to a safer location? Apparently, watching 250mph winds thru large glass panes is NOT as scary as the evacuation.
tornado: heres som wind so th airplanes can fly better
Think about it, some 10 year old&#39;s were born on this day..
What the heck 😳
Brah you letting kid near plexiglass?
People are like children most have to be told what to do because they can&#39;t think for themselves sheeeeesh
How stupid is the people recording  and just not having sense that there is something  wrong  they wait until  they said get out!! 🙄
imagine people taking off at that time though.
Inspiration for 2012 Disaster movie
imagine the window breaks and all those people near it die
I like how people started screaming, because that always makes things better.
What is scary is there are people probably flying right over this trying to land at some point.
Like know ones gonna scream tornado!!!!! Like what
That is probably one of the most expensive places for a tornado to hit. Billions of dollars of aluminum flying tubes waiting to get shreded
&quot;Flight 39 direct to Oz now boarding at Gate 3.&quot;
Thats it, gather to the large plate windows !! Fools !!
Those that don’t know, this is St. Louis. Tornadoes rarely hit our area, so we just watch Storms with the naivety that we could never get hit. I was at the Mills mall when that damn thing hit and there were people standing in the doorway to the mall entrance just  looking at it.
If I&#39;d seen those windows at the beginning I would have instantly shouted to get away from them.
Aren&#39;t the bathrooms supposed to be tornado safe zones??
medo
seriously id be screaming too but not like im getting murdered-
Some of y’all clearly don’t live in tornado alley.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=80">1:20</a> if you hear women randomly screaming in unison...you know 💩 is about to get real
Anyone in the south ever:  Yo... ya might wanna move away from the glass...
Why is it always like this with people. There can be asteroid coming  and everyone will just look at it. Then a person says run. Then here comes the scream, and people running trying to get away
I remember this happening. I was 9 and we visited the Arch. When the sirens went off, we headed below to the museum.
I like how nosey people are just sitting by windows just watching the storm, like they’re in a movie theater. Have none of you seen what Tornadoes do?
I wonder if anyone even realized they were looking at a tornado
Looking out window &quot;ahh that&#39;s so awesome. Looks fun&quot;<br>Yo get out<br>Then there&#39;s that one aaahhhh we&#39;re all gonna die
Somebody had to tell yall to get out?
Masses of people are <br>degenerate sheep 🐑
I was sitting here wondering “why isn’t the airport making an announcement to get away from the windows? shouldn’t they have warned people by now” and they still didn’t. the one employee yelling “YO GET OUT” did better than the entire airport
Nothing like looking thru a glass window as a tornado goes by
Come on.. You dont stand next to the Windows when a tornado arrive 😄😄
Wait till all that glass flys in then move away smart 🤓 people
Don&#39;t look like they had one tornado evac plan
Lordy folks, let&#39;s walk up to the glass and watch a tornado, and; the rest of us, let&#39;s sit here and watch these people.....<br>uhmmmm...doy.....
I wouldve been hiding somewhere safe while everybody watching. The first time I heard that train sound then it stopped and I looked out the window an seen that huge rotating cloud, I almost had a heart attack. It managed to jump over our house and touch down again later. Couldve been my end.
Besides the few that screamed for dramatic effect, I think it was a pretty orderly move to cover.
That is fake<br>Because glass would have broke
It went forwards winds to sideways in about two seconds. That’s some crazy ahi
Mother is angry!
Yes, the smartest thing to do during a tornado is to be right under huge glass windows.
Where was the tornado even at because i can&#39;t see it
I like how the rain becomes visible outside the windows at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=28">0:28</a> thats pretty cool
I&#39;m surprised at the number of people standing RIGHT IN FRONT of the windows while strong winds are blowing outside! I don&#39;t live in the midwest, but I certainly have the common sense to move away from windows when there are high winds blowing. Getting shards of broken glass in my eyes when a window explodes from the wind doesn&#39;t sound like much fun to me!
Oofy
Nothing like making people panic!!! Idiots
Is ridiculous when people get scared when others tell them you should be scared. <br>Is like they don&#39;t have the instinct of something bad is going to happen .
And people will complain because flights are delayed!
Hey jayipatel, do you have an email address at which we could contact you regarding this video? We would be interested to discuss a license to use this video if this is generally possible? (i.e. via email) :) Cheers, Felix
The tourist : huh wow that’s pretty crazy the clouds outside the terminal are spinning<br>The local: <b>YO GET O U T</b> 👁👄👁
Ah, life before covid.
As soon as the weather coming in they should have been moved to safety
Why are they sitting by all that glass sharpnell
And yet everybody&#39;s got their faces plastered to the glass windows.   This so easily could have been the largest group nomination for a Darwin Award.
That was the day my son got married. In St Louis. I had to go back to the hotel and while I was driving back to the reception the tornado hit. I just kept driving even though the Sirens were going off, because everyone else was. Boy my kids were pissed. And the son that got married is petrified of tornadoes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=134">2:14</a> &quot;Your journey is just beginning&quot;<br><br><br>Great choice of words..
Y  no se fue la luz 😁😅🤣
People now a days just look at their phones and don’t even fucking realize what is going around in that area !     It’s funny and sad at the same time.  There is a FUCKING tornado coming in and you are all by WINDOWS!
Ima record this Tornado through this Plywood size glass, I can&#39;t be that dumb other&#39;s are inches from it also.
People at windows: Oooh fascinating 😯<br>People inside: doesn&#39;t care
I’m shocked that not one person thought to back away from the window!
... and this my dear friends is the &quot;hall of morons&quot; - only slightly suicidal glued to  the windows while a tornado is raging outside ........😂
Attention passengers your flight to OZ is now boarding.
Yes, it sounds like a lie but this tornado knocked my neighbors tree on his house, what was worse, both exits were blocked and he was elderly, he was okay, this started in Indiana as 60 mile per hour winds started right above my trailer house,  a barn fell bringing a power line with it. There were no minor injuries,  just some broken legs from idiots running away. the siren went off 10 minutes later.
People are dumb.
That dude did a 💩 job if he was tryna not to get everyone to panic. 😂😂
That&#39;s crazy because this date was the exacted date i was born
Why calmly tell the people to leave the area just for precaution when you can start screaming &quot;GET OUT!! GET OUT!!!&quot; like in a catastrophe movie? That guy needs to learn how to handle people in a panic inducing situation. The weather is scary, the last they needed is some guy shouting &quot;get out!&quot; like the glass is going to explode and Godzilla is going to eat them or something.
This comment section is goated
I sincerely hope that they fire his ass.....the guy that caused the panic. Just who the hell does he think he is speaking to people like that......
Those people laughed and when guard tell them to leave all paniced.. People like those makes me thing of sheep&#39;s. Stupid
Mother nature,, beautiful at times , powerful,and yet can be so destructive.
2011 - 2 years before Playstation 4 release
The damn camera man gave me the shacking baby syndrome!!!!🤪
Airline employee: &quot;Yo, get out!&quot;<br>Random women: &quot;Aieeee!!!!&quot;
Dude, these people dont seem like theyre in a hurry to go to safety.... is that concerning?
Tornado be like: hehe are all ready to die
Everyone was very lucky no glass shattered anyway.
Who tf sits next to a window and films during a tornado like do you not get how wind works
That&#39;s right people. Walk, don&#39;t run away from the danger. Take your sweet time even though your lives are in danger. SHEESH!!! WHAT&#39;S WRONG WITH THESE IDIOTS??!!
I live in St.Louis -oop
Covert aliens roll eyes at dumb humans.
I would’ve been terrified!!
Everyone was chill till that guy shouts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=78">1:18</a>, then some women start screaming and people run for the exit
someone needs to smack those screaming girls
I’d be getting away from then windows
Run dumy!
If I remember correctly, ATC workers on duty first spotted the tornado; there wasn’t much of a chance for any evacuation plan to be implemented.
Go to the bathroom  hide! All that glass ! Get the kids
Get out ! Where would you go? Outside is dangerous. Management should have a system in place for emergencies. They should have known that a tornado was headed that way.
not good
how&#39;s this funny? -.-
Went from giggling to a mental break down in 5 secs
In every crisis there’s at least one hysterical woman.
A drop in pressure could’ve blasted them all with a face full of glass...but I’d want to watch too LOL
I can’t believe they just sat there watching the funnel ! Yo Get Out!
These people are complete morons.
Nobody:that one guy yo get out!<br><br>Everyone:starts to panic 😱
Why don&#39;t they Shut the  Fuck up ??..
The world before covid
Why were they standing by a wall of windows just watching the tornado like fucking move 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=78">1:18</a> I love how unbothered everyone was by staring blankly out the window until the guy yelled “get out.” 😂
Lmao why are they screaming?
quiet until someone yells and then it&#39;s hysteria.<br><br>I really really really fucking hate how people behave.
My mom always taught us to respect God&#39;s power! Not to joke, fun, and play during bad storms! I now understand! They were videoing, laughing, as if to mock,  but no one praying for his mercy!!😃Amazing
I lived in Iowa for only 1 yr and I would&#39;ve been out of there before having to be screamed at. I cant believe the air port didnt get any weather updates wayyy before the person screaming get out smh
Stupidest fucking video on YouTube
The GLASS people! Please get away from the windows!!! That&#39;s the last place u want to be unless you like being stabbed with shards of broken glass and sucked out of a window!!!
Dummies
The reason everyone is staying calm is because they&#39;re thinking &quot;Surely the airport staff which has an AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL STATION of people watching the skies will give us a warning if we need one.&quot;<br>The airport was seriously negligent here.
Why would you keep standing by the window!
“I’m sorry there are no refunds or credits for rough weather conditions”
It always takes just a few screams from hysterical women to set everyone in a panic🙄
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=77">1:17</a> when there is a shooter in the building
I wondered why these people were standing against the windows.
People are truly stupid
Is that when the tornado came thru stl?
Tornado:Happening <br>People:LET’S GET NEAR THE WINDOWS
Someone had to actually tell Them to GET OUT??!!  ...........Amazing  !!!
It also torn the abandoned TWA terminal <br>It got rebuilt and its still abandoned<br>Leading the way TWA come fly with us T W A
It also torn the abandoned TWA terminal <br>It got rebuilt and its still abandoned
Panic won&#39;t do anything!
Everyone: hey a tornado<br>Employee: GET OUT!!!!<br>everyone: HEY A TORNADO!!
Those people must have thought that the glass window was bulletproof or something. I&#39;ve never been in a tornado before but seeing swirling air and lightning would have alerted me right away that something wasn&#39;t right. I would have already been downstairs waiting, like, &quot;What took yall so long?&quot; People just don&#39;t pay attention to their surroundings.
My brain : does st Louis have a tornado proof airport/windows<br>Someone : yo get out<br>People : screams<br>My brain : guess not
So everything is fine until one man panics?
Or somewhere safe
Got down stairs
Fear them
Behold, the wonder of the power of our Almighty Father will be seen all over the world to shaking the people to repent. The disasters all over the world especially this pandemic to remind us there’s a true God. The unmeasurable power of our Almighty Father the creator of heaven and earth is eternal. We must remember during the time of Noah the sinner people were punished by God through the great flood entire world but give us another chance to live on earth to know where is the right place for us either eternal punishment or the Eternal life. Jesus promised us the Eternal Life. We humans do not know about Jesus who he really is. Before God Almighty Father created the earth, Jesus already exists. Jesus is already a Holy spirit before God created all the things on earth. Jesus is with His Almighty Father during God created the world.  Genesis 1:26 &quot;Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”  The Almighty God loves the people so much, He sacrificed His begotten Son Jesus Christ to save us. God gives us another chance to be forgiven through His beloved Son Jesus Christ. Before Jesus came to earth, the Almighty God is preparing a human body for Jesus to enter and that is in the womb of Mary. The words of his Father God are in Jesus Christ,  John 1:14 &quot;The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.&quot; Jesus was sent down to earth to preach and to save the sinners. John 6:38 &quot;For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.&quot; We must accept we are all sinners and we must repent. Accept Jesus Christ with all our hearts. Accept Jesus as our savior, our King, and our loving God. Jesus said in John 14:6 &quot;“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot; We have no right to see the Almighty Father. Only Jesus has the right and sits at the right hand of God the Father. Jesus said to His God Father in John 17:24&quot;Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.&quot; Jesus is our hope to be forgiven, He is the way and the truth and the LIFE. 1 John 2:25&quot; And this is what he promised us—ETERNAL LIFE.&quot;  and let&#39;s talk about the eternal punishment the final judgment and the end of the world. So at the bottom of the world satan was imprisoned and God cast down the fallen angels will be punished by fire along with the unforgiveness of the wicked. We are all repeatedly violating the ten commandments of God and We have sinned in thought, word, and deed. We must repent of our sins. God loves us very much. God wants us to be part of His gift the Eternal Life.
Yooo how are these people not seeming to panick or have anxiety or any panic or anxiety attacks? I would have ran away from the window ASAP😰
Imagine the poor people outside
People from Missouri are reactors not responders. I&#39;ve seen it time and time again.
I get people have anxiety and whatnot, but I cannot stand the people who instantly scream at even the threat of danger. Like you&#39;re gonna be the reason why chaos ensues and people get injured, all cause you couldn&#39;t just hold in your screams for the sake of everyone else.
The idiot think panic!
I&#39;m curious where the grownups for those little kids are. And why they let them sit next to giant panes of glass in a storm let alone a tornado
Did it actually hit them?
It&#39;s the 3 @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=67">1:07</a> for me they didn&#39;t have to be told!!!
THAT SHIT KILLED MY HOUSE, AND TO THINK I SATT IN THOSE SEATS YEARS LATER AT THE AIRPORT.
I was at the zoo when this happend
I flew in right after that tornado hit and it was a klusterfuk
That could have caused a stampede and people being crushed. I would have stayed where I was or sat in one of the shops or restaurants
Every disaster film starts with a kid going to the window
Any one else see Clark Kent at the beginning of the video or was it just me?
To think the people actually needed someone to yell and tell them to move it, slays me. I would have been hauling it as soon as I saw it.
Thats it kids, tornado coming, get goood and close up to those windows!! hahahaha
Yes let’s stand near a windo
Seems like a normal Strom to me
Meanwhile... Chicago...<br><br>Chicago: let&#39;s have some super creepy sirens to make people stay in
He should’ve JUST LET NATURAL SELECTION DO ITS THING🙄😒. Seriously though.......If you were part of this group of idiotst🙃, PLEASE  KICK YOURSELF IN THE ASS. You are clearly a GENIUS, so figure it out. 😝
So who yelling get out..🤷‍♀️
I sorry did I miss something  Nothing came
I&#39;m not shocked why are you that close to the windows 😕
Real geniuses up against and on glass! Also, great work on emergency management and getting people to safety! Maybe use the intercom system?
Humans act like mindless animals when in large crowds during an emergency...
idiots............IDIOTS...........DAM TOURISTS SIT.......KIDS NEXT TO THE WINDOW? DAM STUPID IDIOTS......IF YOU SEE THIS KIND OF AIR..YOU GET AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS.................................LOOK AT THEM PANIC?................why did they sit there? I have been in a tornado.....THEY CAN BLOW OUT A WINDOW PEOPLE........RIGHT ON TOP OF THOSE KIDS
&quot;Your journey is just beginning&quot;<br><br><br>People: no shi-
Ta vendo?<br>Lixos nas ruas...poluição nos rios,desmatamentos,poluição dos carros e indústrias tá vendo tudo isso?<br>Não gente o planeta não é de ferro, esse desastres não é culpa da natureza, pois a natureza mostra coisas lindas e maravilhosas para nos q nos faz bem,<br>Esses desastres é causado por nois, agente ultimamente nos não estamos se importando com o planeta e isso pode prejudicar nos
&quot;Well,...Thanks to the lame ass security, I&#39;m going home!!!&quot;
Yes lets all crowd next to the giant glass windows, fucking retards. Wish those windows would&#39;ve exploded on their faces.
Nothing to see... Only people.. Crappy video
Get away from the windows  geesh! Funny how everyone was busy looking at it the window until the guy shouted for everyone to leave, then they all started screaming &amp; acting out
Seeing them all close got my covid instincts cringing
Video mal tomado.. Sin significado alguno para mostrar
Excuse me, why did my luggage end up in kansas????
Oh my god guys come look out the big glass window! Its a tornado!
Everyone&#39;s just standing and sitting close to the glass hoping to get their eyes blown out by shards of glass or flying debris 🙄
Great job at dude yelling get down makink people panic
That&#39;s crazy. Why didn&#39;t the airport announce they needed to seek shelter.
Sorprende como la gente no se aleja de los ventanales sino que tomas sus celulares y continúan mirando, hasta que dan la alarma y empiezan a correr....no lo puedo creer la gente espera siempre que los demas les digan que hacer.
i imagine a bunch of people dont even know thats supposed to be a tornado, considering how dark it looks outside and that it kind of just looks like sheets of rain falling with some wind. If people had full view of a tornado coming at them in broad daylight theyd probably act different. this is an airport full of travelers so its probably also containing a bunch of people who have never seen a tornado before or know what to even expect. i think a lot of them are probably also 100% trusting the construction of the airport to protect them from the weird winds they are seeing outside anyway.
I love how the first reaction to any life threatening event these days is to hold phone up and start recording. How did people get so oblivious?
Its just a sprinkling rain nothing else to be scared about people while the airport says get out of here the president is coming lol ha ha
My ppl in Starbucks like hurry give me my drink nvm ima just take it all
Why does one lady always scream??? WTF does that help?
Very loud and after a while was LOUD N GHETTO when someone had to do a head count
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=78">1:18</a> EVERYONE EVACUATE!!!
people: OOOOOoooo!.. Cool.<br><br><br>2 sec&#39;s later: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
Lol@ the lady taking a picture of a black window.
There&#39;s always one frantic screaming woman
Id get away from the windows...
Title should have been &quot;what idiots do while a Tornado hits at an airport&quot;
No planes were harmed in the making of this video
Oh look a tornadoe. Let&#39;s go near the enormous glass window and appreciate the force of nature.
Oh it&#39;s a tornado let&#39;s just stand near the window so we can die
Lol imagine laughing at a tornado IN FRONT of a glass 🤣 <i>then it breaks and the tornado yells</i> <b>thats what she saidd</b>
Stupid human beings, incredible!!
That employee saved those brainlets from natural selection.
Why are there always those few people the scream?? Lol like.. chill out. All you&#39;re gonna do is incite panic
And the female shrieking begins…
I’d imagine the fear at the airport outside of the obvious giant glass windows, is the idea of the tornado sending a parked plan into the terminal.
What idiots
They don&#39;t have some sort of system that would alert people to evacuate.  You are in the Midwest and tornados are common.  What isn&#39;t common is having a random person shouting and creating chaos...&quot;Yo get out&quot;
time stamp for “YO GET OUT!” : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=78">1:18</a>
The tornado looks like very fast moving asperatis clouds
All of that glass is scary. I would hide
Watch out for a stampede in that type of a situation
This is like in the Pokémon movie with the storm at the airport
???????
Get away from the window idiots
10 years ago!!!! Damn
Surprised this airport doesn&#39;t have a tornado shelter?  Where were the sensible people going in there??  I noticed when I was at the Denver Airport they have a tornado shelter.
I can imagine this being in American Funniest Home videos with everyone laughing in the background. It&#39;s funny how they get down after it&#39;s over lol. Really!? Well it&#39;s best to satay away from the windows.
Darwanism. Let it do its thing lol
When they staryed yelling i was like a lightning strikes bout to happen
Wow! People aren’t freaking out like the world is about to end! Talk about a shocker!
Ahhh yes &quot; get out&quot; exactly what everyone should do in a tornado ahhh yes
Rip
Ya your right, people are so stupid, standing an laughing, instead of moving, I bet they stop laughing when it got closer!
Day are waiting for there&#39;s flight why ARE alot people AT THE airport FOR THE ✈
Open the window! I need fresh air...
I never going to understand people. If you see bad weather like that ain&#39;t stop in front of windows to take pictures 🙄🙄 be safe take precautions. I
I remember this!! I was there!!  In St Louis Airport in 1990. Catching a connecting flight on my way to Acapulco.  It was crazy, but we were quickly moved to a tornado “safer” area.  Not a tornado safe area, just a tornado safer area!!!
Was this airport in a Godzilla movie?
I came here to see a tornado dam it!!!!!!
Trump is to blame
This makes me embarrassed to say that I live in St. Louis 🥲 they were literally standing by the window filming the tornado while in the midst of it. Anybody from here would know that this didn’t look anything like a typical thunderstorm for us lol 🤦🏾‍♀️
I would be watching but when I noticed it was bad enough thats when I would get somewhere safe
Excellent clip. Even more convincing than the scenes you&#39;d see in a movie. And quite terrifying to watch. Thanks for posting.
People are so oblivious..You can see the smart ones moving away at the beginning..Of course once the guy says get out then the looky lous start screaming….
why tf are people laughing?! Psychos
Banner behind says &quot;Your journey is just beginning&quot;. Very symbolic.
He’s saying “Go” lol
I have to think there was some very long delays that night into the morning
So sick of click bait!  Where is the fucking tornado?  No where on this video!

Ian Malcolm: &quot;Yeah, oooh, aaah, that&#39;s how it always starts. Then later there&#39;s running, and screaming. ...&quot;
Get away from the windows stooges..😂
Americans 😂
Absolutely no sense of self preservation at all, and if my child was sat looking out that window I&#39;d have grabbed them and headed away fast.
Some people feel invincible...some people know better...
Guys look it’s a tornado! Let’s go to the glass window and look at it!
The woman at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=73">1:13</a> taking videos . . . I mean, c&#39;mon !!  When the air outside is clearly moving that fast, you put your stupid phone away and get away from the glass.
Bahhhhh....nothing happen
🙄GOOD JOB AIRPORT PERSONNEL<br>Everyone calm, watching a storm... <br>🗣🗣 GET OUT !!  GET OUT !! <br>🙀🙀🙀 SHEAR PANIC 🙀🙀🙀<br> 🤦‍♀️ That&#39;s way to cause mass hysteria..🤦‍♀️ FFS 🤦‍♀️
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=126">2:06</a>, -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndk1d5lSUNg&amp;t=129">2:09</a> slowed to 0.25, right side, what the hell ? Like wtaf, some one / thing clearly is upright then not,.. did not one person there see that or who have watched the vid ? I made sure before I made this comment that others saw what I saw .. and they did , even though they clearly didn&#39;t like saying that it&#39;s there and it&#39;s odd. Very odd.
It&#39;s all fun and games until the windows start breaking.  Geeezzz . . .
its the same guy he posted
Nothing like yelling fire in a crowded theatre.
I literally live in St. Louis kind of
There’s nothing that says “stay calm” then someone starting to yell
Quick... Everyone head to the glass foyer! <br>Stupid flipping humans!!!

There&#39;s a tornado outside, and people are pressed up against the glass, like &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that pretty?&quot;
Im scared this storms 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪yikes tornadoes
Soo scary storm
👀 so why would you just stand near the glass?
An airport is literally the worst place to be in a tornado so many airports have glass everywhere, and anything remotely protected is usually off limits to passengers
WHY DO PEOPLE ACT SO STUPID WHEN THERE&#39;S A STORM LAUGHING AND SMILING AND PUTTING YOUR FACE UP TO THE GLASS, DUH!!!! PEOPLE SO DUMB!!!!
Not at the window
These people should laying on the floor. <br>Or going to secure area
Someone decided to buy ice 🍦<br>Or maybe last ☕
