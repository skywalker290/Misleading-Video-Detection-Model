THE MOST UNDERRATED SONG IN MUSIC HISTORY
Miss you k k sir......
❤
Kk forever ❤mesmerizing voice always ❤️ 💖 ♥️
Still listening in 2024
No matter what people say about this movie, I liked it. It&#39;s not a phenomenal typical Imtiaz Ali tier movie but it is a quite well culminated love story set in a modern world with modern problems and modern cultures. It&#39;s not a typical old-school romantic comedy/drama movie like Jab We Met or the Rockstar movie but it focuses on a different perspective of modern day romantic relationships. I also feel like Kartik Aryan did a phenomenal job in this movie. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=233">3:53</a> we see him dancing but he expresses his condition so well through his eyes that it makes us feel that he is in no shape to dance at the moment. The hopelessness in his eyes show how he just dances staring blankly just to fool his mind and make him feel like he is okay, and nothing is wrong. Which is a very common human nature usually seen when an individual is in acute denial about something terrible that just happened. Kartik Aaryan deserves to be cast in more similar roles with emotional depth. My man absolutely nails it at pulling off comedic roles as we&#39;ve seen in most of his other movies but this movie proves that he has great potential at pulling off more realistic emotionally deeper characters. But I know not everybody will agree to my last statement and I respect their opinion.<br>Also I love the song. KK requires no introduction and It&#39;s one of KK&#39;s last songs and it&#39;s terribly underrated for some reason. Love it.<br>Rest in peace, KK.
One of my favourite song ✨✨👍👍
Last KK Song!
Itna kyu mere sath ayi tu !
Gem this song is
miss you k.k.😢😢😢😢
This song has so much emotion to it...that only few can understand...it really takes you to the another world if you connect with the. Chorus, arrangement, lyrics and ofcourse k.k♥️♥️

I don&#39;t remember any song 🥺😭
Just love. This song great feeling ❤
Yeh Film mere life kliye iconic hei❤...mei apne life me pehli baar relationship me aya tha..tab yeh film realise huwa tha..aur hum dono milke cinema hall gaye the iss Film ko dekhne 😍. Pehli baar kisi ladki k sath..😍kuch alag hi feelings tha. 3 saal baad hum dono ka breakup ho gaya 😢...abhi v uski yaad ati hei..par woh kisi dusre k saath khush hei. Pehli mohabbat thi woh meri jo adhura reh gaya🖤..usne mere saath cheat kiya tha mere se dur jakar 😢. Abhi toh pyaar se sirf nafrat karta hu..kisi v ladki ko bharosa nahi karta abhi. Patthar Dil insaan baan gaya hu. Iss Film ka gana agar kehi gunjta huwa suna v mere rongte khade ho jate hei💔🖤. Woh mere liye sabkuch thi..uske liye jaan v de diya tha maine...usne kisi behtar ke khatir mujhe hi jinda lash banakar chor diya😢. Pehli pyar mei itna bada dhokha mila mujhe...aur himmat v nahi hei pyar karne kliye kisise... bharosa hi nahi bacha 💔🥲

So sweet song love this song ❤
As a typical introvert ( I used to act like him and still do and even look like him.) I am surprised how this movie matches my life so much.  My love life is the same as it is shown in the film, there is no difference, today I have seen this movie and I have understood that it is a game of all time as shown here. I am the <b>Veer</b> of my story I have lost Zoe and I am sure I will find her again, but I don&#39;t know the time, when what will happen. My girlfriend is like Zoe Just career and career all the time . . but I&#39;m hoping for best and yyup mai bhi yahi maanta hu ki duniya me 2+2 se zyada bhi hota hai  ❤ aur compromised relationship mai kisi ke saath bhi kar lunga bas uske saath nahi karunga..❤
Ladies &amp; gentleman, salute to all of you gathering here listening to this masterpiece from our beloved KK..you truly have good taste of music..love from Malaysia. ❤❤❤
Anyone that can help me with the name of the temple in the last part of the song.
KK is legend
Only 23k likes and 1.7M views 💔.. this generation don&#39;t deserve best music, didn&#39;t deserve KK<br>They are happy with trash
Last song of kk
Sometimes we don&#39;t search for songs,We search for magic❤KK Sir 💯🙌
Miss u KK sir... Hard to believe that u left us in the mid way... but now u made the heaven even more beautiful...U r and u will always b our fav... Rest in peace sir... Love u
Miss you kk sir😢
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=198">3:18</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=232">3:52</a> - The only singer who can lift the emotions of a song to the highest level.. KK ❤️ Miss you legend.. rest in peace.
this may be kks last song, if so he saved this album with this song, otherwise album no use without this song...
People were not even ready for this masterpiece in 2020
Love this song❤
We lost a terrific singer...yes kk was just amazing 👏.  He was always perfect. But sad, we didn&#39;t realize his talent,  while he was alive.
Kk the legend.voice at the age of 50 unbelievable 😮
One of the last songs of KK in bollywood. KK didn’t get what he deserved except 2008-2010. T series also responsible for not giving him songs after 2013-2014. <br>Ps the best part of the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=197">3:17</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=232">3:52</a>
Only legend understand lyrics...❤ masterpiece
It&#39;s problematic to see such songs not even getting 50 million views.. C&#39;mon if views are so less then u can&#39;t even blame the music companies for not giving songs to older singers.. It&#39;s sad to digest this cruel reality... Even after KK&#39;s death the views didn&#39;t get any sort or boost.. Any songs of lord Kakkars, baadshah etc. manage to get 30-40 million views at minimum.. The world&#39;s not a fair place after all...  KK u deserved more, more and MORE..
Goat sont
Master piece by KK sir miss this voice.... what a deep voice...❤❤
Highly underrated
Kk sir ❤❤❤😢
This movie will be called cult in coming years from now .. Imtiaz Ali couldnt save it from the horrors of Sara&#39;s acting but rest everything was on point

Kk sir💔
After listening to this song I m in another world … what a singer KK was ..legend of Bollywood…filled every words with emotions
immortal song by legend  KK
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=232">3:52</a> explains the song perfectly!<br><br>Amazingly potrayed by Imtiaz ali and the lyrics written by Irshad Kamil are both perfect for the song and the situation of this scene<br><br>They both were trying to occupy themselves but their inside hollowness can’t let it happen. They both were their in the moment but you can by the tears of them that they were not. <br><br>Truly a masterpiece and yess KK’s demise can’t be fulfilled 💔
Miss you kk
Miss you kk
💔😌
Highly underrated. This is absolutely high class lyrical song that generally people won&#39;t understand. Awesome
Himachal heven❤
We wish more from you KK. But you&#39;ve gone too early. My eyes are full of tears still now. Why you didn&#39;t take care of your health ???
You would hear this song in bits and pieces in the movie .. but once you hear it full .. trust me you would be addicted .. it’s my 100 time or more here ✌🏻
What a song 😍
Love you, Kartik! ❤😘
Ab to kaan taras jaaynge kk sir ki voice sunne ke liye🥺 i miss you kk sir😞

I just loved KK Sir❤❤❤❤ Kartik expressions 👌👌👌👌❤
Kudos to Imtiaz Ali Sir for replacing Darshan Raval Mehrama song with KK&#39;s Aur Tanha in final draft of this movie🙏🏻
Ap phone pick ni karti
Feel the emotions... Feel the love.... Feel K.K
Miss u💔
My fev song
Kartik when he dances shows great emotion as if he is really missing his girlfriend. So much pain in his eyes. Great actor!
Star kid vs REAL kid
The best and most underrated song from the album.
Yoon tera hona bhi ( your songs) aur tanha karta ( miss you kk sir) &lt;3
This song gives me a whole another level of peace for some reasons.
Aaj 2023 mei recommend hua ye song yaa4
This is my favorite one♥
kk we r listening u here..💔
Fantastic rendering
Hdhhdhd
With kk I lost my robit too. Rip to my love Robit. Kk lives in a our heart.
@sonymusic can you please release the studio version of this song 🙏🙏
Underrated extraordinary masterpiece from and underrated extraordinary movie. I don&#39;t know when I will stop listening to this song. Seems entered a loop. Gotta kind of addiction. If one wish I could make which comes true is bring KK back. Miss him so much 😣
What a background tune.......fall in love with this magic of tone n lyrics together
One of the most underrated songs❤
I do not want to convince anyone but I swear I tried to memorise the song inorder to sing it. But till date I forget the lyrics when I hear it on my earphones. One gets carried away by the music, Irshad Sahab&#39;s lyrics. Moreover one should never try to sync lips with any of KK&#39;s song. Feels like his songs are meant to be heard in his voice only.I used to wait for his songs. He cannot be replaced by anyone 🧡
Kha gaye vo chutiya arijit fans jinko phati awz pasand h.. 😂😂😂 arijit ki.. mhu bandh k baithe h 😂 jisne kk sonu shaan mohit chauhan ni sune vo arijit ko bhgwn mante h 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=135">2:15</a>
What a song...
Most Underrated Song of KK.
Damn bruhhhh kk ❤🐐
Miss KK 🥺
Super song 😌 kuch chiz jate jate hi jati hai ...
You don’t need alcohol anymore , try KK’s soulful rendition. We miss him a lot ❤
This is underrated. Discovered this masterpiece after KK&#39;s death, it makes me sad that this kind of melody won&#39;t be repeated.
Yu Tera hona bhi aur tanha karta
Pritam ko pta hota to 🥺🥺 movie me song kk ke ek jrur hota 🥺🥺..only pritam Mahesh Bhatt camp hi kk ko respect di hai
💜💜💜
KK💚

KK is still alive  !!!!! Perhaps this is called &#39;magic&#39;..
All the songs of this movie and the old Love Aaj Kal were masterpieces , pure magic from Imtiaz + Irshad + Pritam legendary trio
While today&#39;s crowd was so busy shoving their a** with pathetic singers, in between we lost a legend. <br>RIP K.K.  You will live forever in hearts.
K.K. 🥺❤️
Yun tera hona hi aur tanha karta....💔
this song so addicted i listen this more than 5 times a day..............
Beautifully sung by KK! 🙂
Ab chhoda hai toh sach me chhod de mujhko <br>Kyon harr pal ki mehmaan ho gyi tu ❤️❤️
When you listen this masterpiece at 3am and started remembering about her makes the song more emotional 💔

Kk 🙏🏿
One of the most underated song, Touching
Blessed to have grown up in an era when kk &#39;s songs rocked the music industry... used to sing his songs in unison while travelling in school bus, his songs used to be played in freshers as well as farewell functions, and countless memories attached with his songs...RIP legend
I know everyone is reading comments. Kk we loves u ❤️
It was never about playback singing..it is about singing with soul...each and every song of kk has a beautiful lyrics penned by great lyricists..like gulzaar sahab, javed akhtar, mehboob, sayed quadri, irshad kamil, nilesh misra etc... And kk sand only thise songs which touched his heart. So its not about playback singing...but giving life to the lyrics and embedding emotions in them.. thats why kk fans know what true music is and what huge loss we have suffered .... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kkforever">#kkforever</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23noonelikekk">#noonelikekk</a>
Miss u sooooo much kk
Pritam+KK=Heaven ❤️
Shayad aisi Awaz ab nahi milegi
What a song!? This song with such quality is underrated! I have no words! Rest in peace KK, the legend.
Lost into dance at the end is the exactly what osho was talking about
This is honestly the best song of the album. Different composition using African folk with soft rock and fantastic singing by The Mesmerizer. Should have been more aggressively promoted. I think even film producers these days have very bland and shitty musical taste!
kk died on my sister&#39;s birthday :(
what a voice, he will be truly missed
Why such songs don&#39;t get properly promoted.
K.k.sir wapas aa jau na 😥😥😥
Miss you kk
Kk❤️❤️
Unbeatable voice for World 🌎,   Legend Kk💥💥💥
Yes coming yesterday
I don&#39;t know but the lyrics literally breaks heart💔💔💔💔
Ufff...Those high notes !!!<br> &quot;Na main waada karta hoon, na main bhoola karta&quot;
Kk sir.. miss u lot sir..aap to chale gye hum to bss ji rahe hai..kuch bhi achha nhi lagta aap ke song ab sunte hi Rona ata hai..God sir ko ek chance de dete...sir aap ke bina life mein kuch missing hai sir.. Miss u badly dear kk sir..🥺💔
This song is different from the songs of other album 😊 KK is different ♥️
This song is underrated but it is not ordinary song 🥺

Whatever anybody say but sara is superb in movie
Kk 💔
Miss you kk full time....
Song of the decade for sure❤️
Plz KK Sir wapas a jao 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The haunting vibes of this song gives goosebumps and makes me listen several times! Truly a masterpiece song by Pritam + KK. But I wonder why its so underrated, the times and taste of people about music has changed a lot. But a true admirer of music will definitely appreciate. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rip_kk">#RIP_KK</a>. You will always stay alive in our heart and soul.
Kk is kk gaane ka style sabse alag amazing as always

Nice song kk sir🥰🥰👌👌❤️❤️ nice 👍👍
bollywood fails to utilise kk properly
KK sir my favourite singer in my college life (2012-15) iske alawa koi n other name nhi tha . Miss u always remember in our heart ❤️
You were amazing singer KK sir, this song give me goosebumps and as well as want me to cry❤️
Love you sartik ❤️
Love you KK<br>I used to cry with this song<br>Now I cry for your absence..<br>Really don&#39;t know why this happened..<br>Maybe God loved you more than we did...
💔
Only kk sir😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Every comment here is about kk even before his death , glad that people valued and appreciated him even before his death .
Kk ❤️
It&#39;s been only four days and I&#39;ve already listened to this song over 25 times. I can&#39;t understand why I couldn&#39;t have listened to this fantastic song for so long? However, many thanks to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23shilparao">#ShilpaRao</a>, the co-singer behind &quot;Khuda Jaane&quot;. I was just randomly searching old interviews of KK and what other celebs talk about him, then I found one video where she was seen mentioning this song &quot;AUR TANHA&quot; from the movie Love Aaj Kal 2 (2020). It just gave me goosebumps. No other singer in the entire universe can bring such magic and feel through his songs after Kishore Kumar &amp; Kumar Sanu. I can&#39;t get you out of my mind and  heart. I really don&#39;t want. It pains me a lot having the knowledge of u not being around. You&#39;re gonna stay forever through your simplicity, smile and songs..
I liked it for kk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=141">2:21</a> the real haunting starts from here
Legend RIP
KK The Mesmerizer, You are eternal.
There will be no one like u KK sir..❤️ miss u so much..😭😭😭 please come back.. 😭
No hate but arijit, jubin and other singers has saturated the industry with same monotonous songs that KK&#39;s voice feels like a breathe of fresh air.
KK will live forever!
In kk&#39;s voice each and every song is phenomenal...
KK , please return if possible..we need you..💔🙏
Miss uhhh KK💔💔...
Superrrb Awesome Fantastic song

He will live with his, in his voice

I have listened this song for many times
Most underrated song
Just feel like listening to kk&#39; songs and just forget all worries of life so soothing his voice is 🙂👍
When you release someone but fail to free yourself from them.
KK&#39;s voice is magical
I am big fan of u kk
Luv u bro

Kya song hai yaar ye kahi aur hi le jata hai aur is song ka music just amazing ek feeling hai sach mein
Kk ♥️♥️♥️
Even his new songs r evergreen such a underrated legend
The freshness that KK brings to this song is just fabulous.
kk remembered back me 1999 to 2005
Sometimes I listen to this song on repeat and can work for whole night in front of laptop.
We need more songs of kk
The credit goes to Pritam amazing music.... And amazing singer Kk...
Nice song
yaa filling alone love is one only one ..forever .sif u u i tu hi tu love for u
KK
KK sir is one of the great singer of Indian music history..
KK
The views on this song prove that audience with good taste in music are decreasing very rapidly.
I listened this song after watching the interview of Pritam-Irshad-Imtiaz with some channel... And then I found it very boring at the start and thought it&#39;s just an average song... And being a KKian I just don&#39;t like KK having average songs... But Here I decided that I&#39;ll listen this till the very end... And man... It was melody.<br><br>Literally Pritam only could make such a soothing song yet it being a sad one... KK&#39;s high notes and soothing voice also nailed it while Irshad&#39;s lyrics were also great.<br><br>I just see now that I can&#39;t expect kind of songs from bollywood which were made in late 90s &amp; early-mid-late 2000s... Like Dil Ibadat or Labon kind songs for example.<br><br>They are milestones and these songs literally doesn&#39;t have a chance(including this Aur Tanha song too) in front of 2000s music.<br><br>Anyway this song was still kind of &quot;best kind of&quot; from the generation it came out in. Nowadays we don&#39;t expect melodies but still Pritam has got some legacy so we still can expect some good melodies nowadays.
K.k ❤️❤️
My fav. Song
Pritam ji kaha se copy kiya gaana 😅
:) this whole messed up generation can&#39;t understand kk!
Always fav...KKK💙

My observations of this music video, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=5">0:05</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=30">0:30</a>, the girl in this music video, her body language is quite impressive. In beginning of video of course. It impresses the guy so much!
The only singer in Bollywood who can sing the high notes with so much ease!😇

Meanwhile Bachpan ka pyar has 32 crore views🥵😱
I was reading with you tube auto generated playlist on in background, and as vocals started, I recognised it was k.k. and I knew this is gonna be special! This man never disappoints!!

Underrated one.

One of best song of kk ... Magic voice...Always rock star kk
Mesmerising KK
Heere ki parakh johari ko hi hoti hai , 😅 that&#39;s why Here views are defining that we are 🥰🥰 not every fuddu listener
I love this song<br><br>I love KK Voice<br>❤️
Main yun tanha jeeta hoon, jaise koi marta, <br>Yeh bhi koi jeena hai, jo hai aankhe bharta, <br>Yun tera hona bhi, aur tanha karta. <br><br>I wonder how can a person come up with lyrics so freaking sad. This is loneliness at its peaks.
In today’s era only auto tuners are getting more views not these kind of legend singers ...sad to see
KK songs should be promoted with tag line<br>&quot;By K.K the mesmerizer of decade.&quot;
I love this song so much
I love you kk sir 😘😘😚😚😚😚😚
Kk 🔥🔥❤❤<br>Not even 1 million view.. Indian audience 👏👏
Haunting melody. Breathtaking cinematography. Brilliant acting.
KK voice always legend 😊🎧👌
Our childhood legend KK. <br>Kk mera pura bachpan hai I was grow up listening his songs💚🥺
I used to think Kartik can&#39;t act, does stereotypical films and roles.<br><br>The last 1 minute of this song changed my mind.<br><br>Hope he does justice to his talent by choosing good films.
Why there is not millions of view in this song <br><br><br>Let me tell you this answer<br>Cause of loss of taste to viewers if it is right then like here 👇👇
I have no girlfriend but<br>When iam listening this 🥺 song <br>-This song make me 😭
This man..... Mesmerizing me since since 1998.... That voice....<br><br>I call him a part of my collective consciousness
Kk kuch bhi gado yar fantastic lagta h

It is rare to find 3 - 4 good Original songs in an movie album Nowadays.
Imtiyaz Ali&#39;s portrayal of loneliness arising out of unfulfilled love is absolute class and shockingly true without being over dramatic. He has done this in atleast one scene of all the movies he&#39;s directed and he absolutely nailed it with this one too. Kudos to his mastery.<br><br>This song is literal perfection. Every little thing about the song is absolutely stunning and perfect. This coming from today&#39;s Bollywood Music Industry is quite a shock. KK is Love..!!
Kk  voice gives2 in one vibes bollywood and pop
Wow this song is gorgeous
Neha Tony to thik par arijit ko galat bolne walo ke paas music kisi samajh nh hh
No song is dependent upon movie arijit sir ke gaane toh hit hue
If someone is telling that this song is underrated so listen it is overrated
Kya vahiyaat gaana hh
love your voice bro..KK 🤘🤘🤘
This type of song don&#39;t have more views why I don&#39;t know actually they don&#39;t know what is real talent
मैंने बहुत से दोस्तों को देखा है, उनका सभी का दिल कभी न कभी टूटा है,लेकिन मुझे लगता है लडकियों का भी दिल💔 टूटता है,,मुझे लगता है, एक नेकदिल सच्चे इंसान को, झूठा, मतलबी, गलत इंसान मिल जाता है,,.... kabhi kisi ko v hurt nahi krna chahiye,♥️...
Bhot galat he yar itne kam view vo bhi itne beauityful song ko
Oh my lord Krishna. Thank you for my idol KK 🙏
Love you

This is not KK who is singing this song 🖤 all musical instruments are singing with KK 🖤💯
What a mesmerizing voice kk sir has.. That he perfectly overshadowed kartik and sara
What a soulful song.. The best song from the album I feel.. Don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t promote kk sir&#39;s song like other songs of the same album..
Kk voice is best
Kk is legend
K.k sir ❤️

Listen to Tu Salamat from the film Mukhbir. The same combination..  Pritam Irshad Kk
everyone says that its ok not to be loved back<br>but no one talks about how to get over that feeling
Great song given to this bekar movie.
I LOVE MY FAVOURITE SONG
No words to express my feelings when watching the songs of this movie and highway. Specially this song and kaha hoo main from highway.
kk sir aapki jay
Imagine ranvir &amp; deepika/anushka in this song ,,
Yun tera Hona bhi<br>...<br>Aur tanha karta <br><br>Kk is the best
My fvt hindi song of 2020 and 2021 ❤👈💫
The song gives a fresh &amp; holistic feeling, the tune is so acoustic &amp; large as the mountains &amp; its valleys.
Only those who have had the same experience can truly understand this movie and this song....
I had never listened to this song carefully I used to think &#39;Aur Tanha&#39; looks like some boring old song but someday  when I was listening &#39;Yeh Dooriyaan&#39; of the same album the song strtd i was already feeling empty and as K.K started singing I strtd weeping until the song was not finished. I strtd missing the guy to whom I was missing and i played this song the whole night. Since from that, day i use to listen this song and i really adore the lyrics. I forgot that there are still such beautiful songs in bollywood which we usually ignore and swithc towards Hollywood.
His voice moves your whole soul to another dimension..❤️❤️❤️kk❤️❤️❤️
Absolute love ❤️
The climax of this song is prophet level
Kk forever !!
This song is a gem...<br>Highly underrated. <br><br>KK&#39;s vocal, Pritam Da&#39;s melody, Irshad saheb&#39;s words &amp; Karthik&#39;s performance ❤<br><br>I can feel every bit...😒😒
Soulful and peaceful song of 2020 ❤❤❤❤

Awesome song just awesome💯♥😍
My ringtone starts from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=231">3:51</a>
Only Sony music knows the worth of KK 🙌😍 Huge respect 🙏🙏❤️
So many good singers are there, but KK is my favorite 😊
New Singers Men Woh Feelings Ni Jo KK Sir Ki Voice Men 🙏
KK Era 😭❤️
The fact is those lyrics belongs to Rafi saab and Kishore da&#39;s era.<br>Our stomach has not yet been able to digest it!
Missing someone 😭
This song deserves its own original video..
Beautiful song 😍✨❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=185">3:05</a> hits different 💓💓💓👍
KK❤️
Don&#39;t know, I felt I&#39;m back in those 90s songs. The song which used to hold meaning and used to infect the heart. I was back in those infectious days. Hit like if you felt the same.
<b>KK</b> should be given more songs... He deserves a lot more.
Ooooo starts and the goosebumps come ❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Dn0LmOfP0&amp;t=230">3:50</a> wow
<i>They should have added those dialogues.</i>
Whatever movie is there, the heart gets comforted by listening ... The heart itself knows that this song belongs to kk sahab
KK 🔥😭
I&#39;m The Only One Who&#39;s Missing K.K&#39;s Melodious Songs In 2021♥️🥺✨🎶🎻💫
Irshad Kamil + Pritam + KK = Super Duper as always
🌹🌹🌹🇲🇷💝🌺
Every word has a feeling in it....the feeling of true, un-filtered love.<br>Masterpiece by KK.
Kk is god🙏🏻
I waited for this song when the trailer released. It’s such a haunting melody. Simply beautiful. Also the cinematography is so awesome. Two people deliberately drowning themselves in work to keep themselves occupied but unable to fulfill the hollowness inside.
KK&#39;s voice always takes me to my dream-world
Kk is evergreen...
This is the turning point of Kartik Aaryan and breaking of his comic stereotypes . Just keep watching , Kartik will deliver some classic gems . Thanks to Imtiaz Ali , no matter Indian audience often make masterpieces flop . This is another underrated movie . Watch it then you will realise the experiment in music , cinematography , screenplay . This is a strong movie and a complete worthy album!
Kk<br>Arijit<br>Mustafa Zahid<br>Atif <br> <br>Are the Legendry singers with 0 Hate maybe few people will hate bcz of bad politics
