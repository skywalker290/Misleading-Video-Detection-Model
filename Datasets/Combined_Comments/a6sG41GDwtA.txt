her fault, she jumped the fence and dived in . she didn&#39;t fall
@Maciluver155  it&#39;s not like the polar bear jumped into her enclosure. it&#39;s not the polar bear fault being put in a zoo and someone jumped into it, mental or otherwise. 
who gives a fuck about polar bears. you lot go on like these animals are your siblings, dum fucks
the bear are thinking hmm what a nice big fat roast pork!
this is stupid .. she must did something very wrong .. just like same story happen in san francisco in the tiger pans.
where is  her bloody family????  she should be kept in custody of someone !!!
I feel really bad for her, apparently she DID have mental problems. Like, I mean, its not her fault is it? Maybe whoever was with should have been taking better care of her... I hope the polar bears dont get put down because of her either though. Its not their fault either.
wow
these comments are so gross
u guys make me wanna throw up
what a stupid bitch..
You are full of fowl smelling shit. What report said so? Go ahead, do a search. Find me one example.
fucking hilarious bro
Report said her ipod fall inside and she jumped in to get it back.
thanks for posting, by the way. Probably cant find this very many places yet.
hahaha that rescue is an epic fail. i feel sorry for the lady, there is obviously something mentally wrong with her. I feel like i have deja vu... didnt this happen like a year ago as well at the very same zoo? Do these polar bears have some sort of voodoo mind control that makes people want to join them?
damn stupid DX.... learned her lesson i would hope
