😱
Hy &#39;Warner Bros. Pictures&#39; .<br>It part 1 + 2 was very good made in is very good.<br>It&#39;s very rare that a genre have this high quality.<br>For me are both one of the best movies in this genre, because the atmosphere is nice made with the sound, score, effects.<br>If you ever can say &#39;thank you&#39; to the director and everyone.<br>That&#39;s the difference of having passion or only want make money.<br>If you ever get the rights for a &#39;The Darkness&#39; movie it&#39;s important to make a nice score (metal, electro...) and set the right dynamic with new cinematic technology to make rollercoaster action scenes.<br>And if you like listen my song &#39;SCIFU7E - OutsideR&#39;.<br>Good luck for your company, thanks for your products and have nice days + everyone too 🍀🌟 👋♾🍹
Part 3
🤐😇
I’ll be great for the losers club
When people think he says “Come Home To Daddy” I Think he is saying “Come Home To Derry”

James McAvoy saying &quot;Derry&quot; in his Scottish accent gives me life<br><br><br>SO HYPED TO SEE THIS MOVIE
Bro I’m out I live right next to LA I’m going
now i understand all the trailers in james McAvoy&#39;s lives on instagram HAHAHAHAHA it&#39;s.... because.... of the carnival... yeah he said come home to daddy yada yada yada but bill hader looking like one to me 👀😏😳

IT😈
Wow! Looks so so cool! I&#39;ll love to go!...<br><br>And I live in Spain 🙂...
<b>Come home to daddy</b>
Full Maze Video on my Page!!!!!

They should have done this in Maine.
I’ll come
I’m not 17 or 18
FLOAT INTO THEATERS HAHAHAHA OMG SO FUNNY GOOD ONE JESSICA
I hope this will be amazing. thanks I just waiting here in Brazil.
I reeeeeeaaaaallllyyy want to go but won&#39;t get to
<b>cries in east coast</b>
Now that&#39;s just unfair<br><br><br>I&#39;m in the uk
Garbage
You&#39;re not my daddy James...
Who in their right mind would want this?
Gosh, I just love James&#39; Scottish accent
То чувство, когда в России фильм  выйдет раньше, чем выйдет мировая премьера.
&quot;Find your way out of the mirror room&quot; 😳 definitely not scary.
They rereleased it in theaters and they showed a little clip of chapter 2
It took me a while to get that the guy said come to Darry and not come to daddy..
These thirsty-ass comments after James McAvoy 😂
im crying why
James McAvoy said “Come Home To Daddy” Change my mind
I’m coming hell yeah!!!!!!!
To bad I live in Europe lmao
Is it a coincidencethat my birthday is when It 2 will premiere?
“Come home daddy” okay i will for you
I wanna see the movie but I’m not old enough to watch rates R movies😭.Im reading the book though at least
What’s with the carnival theme this year
He said “Come to Derry” he had a diffrent accent but the joke is hilarious
Eddie&#39;s actor looks like he&#39;s Jake Gyllenhaal&#39;s brother
Ниче не понял, но это ах*енно!!
Who cares about IT 2 chapter when James McAvoy invites you to make him your DADDY.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7gIT3OfXRk&amp;t=10">0:10</a> <br>Am I the only one who wants some of those posters?
I wish they can sell more tickets again
I honestly live in the most boring place ever
OMG...I LOVE JAMES MCAVOY SO MUCH!!!!! I SEE ALL YOUR FILMS!!!!!😍😍😍
Tamil dubbed to it
am i the only one that have a phobia of scary clouns and still want to see this movie?
Come home to daddy 😂😂😂
Ends on my birthday 😆
Jessica Chastain 😍😍😘😘
Dont have to convince me other wise. I&#39;m so there!! Movie time!!
I want to go!😭
Why can’t I live in LA😭
Holy shit hearing James talk with his real accent <b>has me feeling some typ&#39;a way</b>

Scariest laughing of pennywise <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7gIT3OfXRk&amp;t=38">0:38</a>
I wish they release this movie in india WITHOUT ANY CUTS.
Site kept crashing when I was tryna get tickets 🥺
It sounds amazing!! Unfortunately I won&#39;t be able to attend due to it being so far away and I don&#39;t have the money to travel but I will be watching it the day its released! I would love to go though. Bet it will be awesome!  So excited for the movie. Always been a penny wise fan and a fan of clowns.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7gIT3OfXRk&amp;t=3">0:03</a> I thought it said “Come home to daddy” 😂
Is it September yet ? Just can&#39;t wait anymore.
Bitch i used to explore thecderry sewers as a kid.. Its my home town where they filmed
Can&#39;t afford.
I really expect that Henry&#39;s assault to the Loser&#39;s Hotel is as good as in the book
I can&#39;t go because I&#39;m fucking 16🤦‍♀️😢🤬
“Come home to Derry” boi that heavy accent James has had me thinking he was saying something else. 😂
I’m ready
I want to go there so bad but I live in ny<br><br><br><br>Shid

James can do the best American Accent in the World
&quot;come home to derry&quot; yesss daddy whatever you sa- oh you said derry not daddy? oh okay
I actually believe that this is how the kids would look like in 20 years
Hey it&#39;s Alec Holland

“COME HOME TO DADDY”
We all know the true IT experience is a group of boys and there only female friend doing things in a sewer together that will always be cut out of every IT film adaption ever made.
I honestly thought James McAvoy said &quot;Come to Daddy&quot;...<br>I had to rewind
