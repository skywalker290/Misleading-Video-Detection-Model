Yeah when you encounter a wild cougar, maybe don&#39;t f*cking pursue it.
Now can we get a voice over of Seinfeld and George discussing how to approach and leave?  That would be the funniest thing ever!!
A spectacular cat. Thank you for sharing.
Why would you proceed up that trail? Endangering yourself and her.
you were being stalked
Whatvare you doing? Nuts!
Wow, they&#39;re lucky that cat didn&#39;t rip them apart!
the fact that the cat blended in with the background and looked like a freakin statue was the scariest part of all
Why are they walking towards it???
It is over human. I have the high ground.
Guaranteed these people were white. Why would you follow it??? smfh
Always carry when walking in the forest. If your a gun hating kook then get a can of bear spray.
If u were by urself they would haven’t even have found ur shoes unless one fell off during the attack
Why do people go on &quot;&quot; Nature &quot;&quot; hikes and never be prepared for an animal encounter. Pepper spray, bear spray, a loud air horn, a tree branch or a walking stick / protective club. Hell, even a hunting knife at the minimum. And NEVER try to scare or attack and animal, or throw rocks or branches at it. It will consider you a threat and possibly attack you. If you can carry a firearm, do so. Not to kill the animal, but as a last resort if it decides to test you, shoot a shot in the air or on the side of the animal to scare it. Don&#39;t shoot the animal, it might have a mate you don&#39;t see and who sees you and attacks you. Back away, come together as a group and SLOWLY back the rest of the way away from it / them. Don&#39;t be foolish and become its dinner !!!!!!!! 😺
I have had a few mountain lion encounters, and noticed a few things.<br>1.  They never just run away.  They always want to see where you are.  So if you see one, and then lose sight of it, it likely still has eyes on you, and closer than you think. <br>2.  They instinctively seek higher ground, which is advantageous.  <br><br>The most recent time, for me, was riding my dirt bike at night near Yosemite.  I almost hit a HUGE cat on a tight trail.  Came around a corner on the throttle, and it was turning around and jumping uphill and away from me.  I missed his tail by mere inches.  I hope because of all the noise of my dirt bike, and the bright lights that the big kitty was as scared of me as I was of it.  Needless to say...I kept going and did not slow down at all.  The experience has me re-thinking riding my dirt bike alone...at night...which is something I really enjoy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJxDWX-qes&amp;t=74">01:14</a> see that ear twitch? She is thinking about f*cking you up for real.
Got um. 🤣
Looks like huge dump of shit behind it
I wonder how many hundreds of times this has happened when I&#39;ve hiked the trails through the years. With the handful of human deaths over the past century, you know that the overwhelming majority of cats let humans stroll ignorantly by, never knowing. It is so nice to see weapons left at home, guns and ridiculous panic are not justifiable here.
Yeah, back up. It looked sort of calm enough in the end and with you talking calmly. I think it just wanted to escape and going to the higher ground was done in panic and I think it regretted that move.....it did a bit of a blink and an ear twitch so to me that says sort of calm. I think staring at them makes them feel uneasy..
When hiking, it&#39;s good to peek around corners. But you also need to look up. Mountain lions don&#39;t hunt on the same level as prey. They hunt from above so they can surprise it.

Don&#39;t try and sneak up on a felis-cougar, they are much better at it.
Kurang jelas makna video ini... ✌✌🇮🇩🇮🇩
How are y’all not educated on mountain lions hiking out there?
What is &quot;OS X: Mountain Lion&quot; doing on &quot;macOS High Sierra&quot;?
Why did you follow it?! You’re very, lucking to be alive!
Last i needed to see before hitting the HST soon!
You should yell and throw things at it to scare it to death of humans so that it doesn&#39;t get comfortable around which makes it more likely to attack a human and having the park rangers hunt it down and kill it.
Throwing something seems like a good tactic. Many animals are freaked out by projectiles thrown at them.
Holy Crap Batman!!! Yikes!!! 😮
Thats why i always take  present with me when i go there , so that if i see a mountain lion, i will give him the present and he  will let me go !
Please don&#39;t follow a mountain lion up a trail. My goodness
Had a pretty close encounter like that with a black bear in the High Sierras on trail as well. Makes you super nervous but at the same time you are trying to not make yourself look like prey, good call with the bear spray glad you didn’t need it. Big kitty clearly heard you coming and was curious about you as well
Where’s your Glock 10mm???????
They say cougar attacks are rare but does that matter to the people who are killed? And as the cougar population increases there will be more and more attacks. There is a reason they killed off cougars and wolves.  And now we are having coyote attacks. Predators are predators.
Douglas squirrel in the background
Best footage I&#39;ve seen. Was expecting him down the trail or behind that rock.<br><br>A dog in this situation would be a great asset, provided he doesn&#39;t run after it and get himself killed.
I take 5 bags of Beef Jerky, you never turn your back like he did, never run, a knife is helpful just incase it ignores the Jerky, great content displayed no fear and thanks for living to be able to share 🧗🏻‍♂️👦🏻👍🏻🗻
I hope you guys had a gun on you, otherwise following this beast was a dumb idea
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJxDWX-qes&amp;t=40">0:40</a>  he up there looking down like Bruce Lee but u don&#39;t know how he got up there so fast.
Yeah, chase a Mountain Lion... Remember, they also kill Bull Elk for food (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz-iT3dxXb4)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz-iT3dxXb4)</a> who weigh over 600 lbs, you have NO CHANCE if they come you, regardless of the Park Service telling you to fight back if attacked. She is definitely a mother and her kits were like just on the other side of the trail that she was facing as they arrived (though I think they saw her earlier, hence the video). Notice how once she has the high ground and they back away, she looks directly towards the trail (away from them) to likely ensure her kits are okay. Just a good mother taking care of her young in the company of dumb ass humans.
Imagine our ancestors dealing with saber tooth 😩
I think if it was only one of them then this might have ended a different way.
Only white people do nonsense like this!! &quot;Ooh I wanna get a closer look&quot;? Then your dinner......smh!!!
What happened to being scary making noise...quietly filming is bad. Throw rocks and blow a whistle.
something makes me suspect that it was trying to lure him in.
@Jeffrey Pillow...🤣🤣🤣he said..&quot;I would had Puma (poo ma) pants..😂😂😂
Hey, so, it looked like you already won this mountain lion encounter.  Curiosity killed the cat (thankfully not a Brian) don&#39;t you know? :P
It probably saw them, ran off, then decided to spy. It was already in a defensive state of mind, already scared of them. Probably preoccupied with another task at the time. They got lucky.
I had a dream last night that I encountered a mountain lion where I currently live which is our in the boonies.
I doesn’t matter high ground or not these cats come down to near by city’s and seen 40 miles away from the forest so your really not safe in the forest  anywhere.  Live near there
Ambush lol
Omg
One round fired into the air would remind the cat we are still superior...for those who are still inclined to not be food for the wild animals they enjoy seeing on the trail.
I wpuld have taken my. 50 beowulf and blasted its face off....seriously wouldnt be walking that shit unarmed
Super footage.. You got lucky with this Lion..!! Here Kitty Kitty Kitty... You can run into mountain <br>lions in Alum Rock Park and by Stevens Creek Reservoir on the edges of <br>Silicon Valley..!!!
&quot;What are you supposed to do?&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; <br><br><br>so relatable
Well, your hiking friend was really helpful in a serious situation. I hope you don&#39;t find yourself together with him during a situation that requires swift action.
&quot; ohh looook ! A mountain lion on this lost secluded hiking trail....<br><br>Let&#39;s follow it.....&quot;
That made me puma my pants.
Bobcat - surprise bitches
Meat Eater: Yeah, but we&#39;re top of the food chain.<br><br>Vegan: ...
Scare
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJxDWX-qes&amp;t=40">0:40</a><br><br>Mountain Lion: so.... why tf were you following me?!
The most chilling mountain lion video I&#39;ve seen. Watching it walk away then sit up on the mountain staring at you looks like something out of a movie.
Like others have said - bonehead move to pursue her; she was ready for you. Thankfully, ya&#39;ll wised up and handled your retreat well! You can see her alert level drop slightly as you guys slowly disengage. Crazy encounter!
What a great wildlife encounter! I’m glad it ended up well for both you and your bud and the cougar! Can I share this video on my Instagram @hikingthe globe?
Hikers: Sees a mountain lion, then proceeds to follow it<br>Me: why you following the thing that will murder you in a few seconds. Dufus
WOW,  what a rare experience and also scary!  So glad you were able to capture on film and thanks for sharing! BTW what time of the day did you see the cat at?
WHY WOULD YOU EVER FOLLOW A MOUNTAIN LION?!! My ass would have backed away as soon as it ran around that corner
What a Beautiful and Majestic creature.
Really cool experience and footage although probably very scary for these guys
Were you hiking to whitney ?
The cougar was setting an ambush. If you walked around the corner and didn&#39;t see the cougar, and you thought that the cougar had walked further down the trail around the next corner, it would have jumped on your back and had you for dinner. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to understand the difference between how bears and cougars hunt. Bears will rip you from limb to limb using brute force in a direct confrontation. Cougars always target the back of the neck to paralyze their prey in an ambush.
It was going to bounce on the person if they didn&#39;t notice it as they passed by.
I hike with a loaded firearm!
He got higher to have an advantage on you lol you are lucky. Don’t ever follow a big cat.
Idiot, you kept walking after him? Its pure luck you werent ripped to pieces.
Hes like boy what you doing in my area
Haha, the Animal instantly goes the other way and you follow her. I am no expert, but the  first thing I would have done is do the same as the mountain lion and go into the opposite direction and wait there.
Sanity requires that you back off.  Going forward is a crap shoot.
I am sure by now you have heard that you are supposed to look big and try to intimidate it, easier said than done eh :-)
Mountain lion, puma, cougar whatever tf you call it; ITS OVER I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND
The cat was like What&#39;s good g
That lion definitely looked like it had intentions
Mountain lion: I have the high ground!!!
I know cats too well not to shit my pants right .....( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJxDWX-qes&amp;t=42">0:42</a> ) here
look big sound big and walk back slowly
She didnt seem like she was ready to attack. Just cautious about you.
just amazing how it&#39;s color blended into that dead tree behind it
“What are you supposed to do?” <br>Well, not following it out of curiosity is a good fucking start.”
Wow that was creepy how he was blending in there with background , he or she is beautiful tho
That lion was luring you round that bend, their favorite attack is from above and behind...if you hadn&#39;t stopped where you did, she woulda stopped you.
It’s over I have the high ground
These dudes are calm as a mother   fucker. I&#39;d be crying while preparing to die 😂😂
Mountain lion had that facial expression like: “Ummm, do these white people NOT know who I am?” 🤷🏽‍♂️
&quot;Go outdoors&quot; they said.. &quot;it&#39;ll be fun&quot; they said...
Following that cat could have easily been why you were killed. Another reason to carry a 10mm while out in the forest.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJxDWX-qes&amp;t=52">0:52</a>....... it&#39;s always good to know the answer to that question before you decide to follow a cougar up a trail.
Holy shit I would&#39;ve shit 💩💩💩in my pants.  He took the high ground
Yeah pretty sure I just pissed myself yep there it is soon as that cat look down from the mountain
Not too smart continuing on the trail. Could have ended badly.
I did, did ! -  I did taw a puddy-tat !
it was ready to pounce thats how they like to attack by jumping from above onto prey.
That would have made me puma pants
Puma documentary film about the secret life of cats : Big cat and her three little in wild nature<br>Mountain Lion (cougar, puma) - High Sierra Trail, CA
Logic of hiker- Sees mountain lion and goes to follow it. Fucking hell that was scary just a few yards in the face of the mountain lion
He panned around and the mountain lion was like you think you slick following, i seen you
khajit has wares , if you have coin
That was hilarious how you guys were peeking around the corner, but that whole time she was up there watching you. Loll. But glad you guys are okay 👌🏾
Ahh....so you move towards the dangerous animal? Lol see this is the type of madness I don&#39;t understand.  Then people say the city is dangerous and full of crazy people.
Running away how odd for a killer. But actually what they do all the time.
Lucky you&#39;re alive, but dont make that mistake again. Once you saw her you should immediately turned back to where you came from. Notice that when she noticed you guys she was waiting for you on top of that rock. Please dont make that mistake again and try to confront them that close!
That’s why I always carry a gun
Beautiful animal.   <br><br>For your safety...  it&#39;s not a good idea to follow a cougar... especially when you lost sight of it.  You are lucky to be alive.  At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJxDWX-qes&amp;t=38">0:38</a> it was probably already sizing you up and deciding if you were dinner.  If it had been more hungry.. outcome might have been different.   <br><br>If that ever happens...  stay close with others, raise your jackets and look large, make noise, and back out of the area... never loose sight of it or give it your back if possible.
He just trying get a view of you like you trying to gwt a view of him
Man two minutes of video is not worth it you should of backed up out of there when you first saw it !!!!
The cougar was like, Sir how may I help you?
lol the cat was like &quot;THEY CAN&#39;T SEE ME THEY CAN&#39;T SEE ME THEY CAN&#39;T SEE ME THEY CAN&#39;T SEE ME THEY CAN&#39;T SEE ME&quot;.
Dont turn your back to them as you back away.
Khajiit has wares...if you have coin
should always have a laser poiter handy for this reason
Was that in national sequoia park or high Sierra trail I saw couple videos were telling me different location so I’m not sure where this was happening
You were almost cat food. You were smart good for you.
Whistle it to sleep?
Man it blended right in.
Gald i always go Hiking with my 2 Dogos Argentinos
Makes me happy to see this. Hope all human stay safe while being curious and respectful of animal territory.
What a scene😯
Pretty smart cat.  He knows how to camouflage himself with his natural surroundings.
Great footage
Lucky not alot of humans can say that they had that experience and come out unscaved
Wilderness hint # 247.........When encountering a carnivore large enough to kill and eat you?  Turn around and go the other way!
You are very, very....very lucky
OMG
They looked like a couple pork chops to the cougar.
fullsend
I’ve been face to face with a bear before well riding my bike I tried to film but I was to late
It&#39;s over, hikers!  I have the high ground!<br><br>You underestimate our running speed.<br><br>Don&#39;t try it.
Th cougar took high ground in an attack position, you are very lucky
this is extremely dangerous cats in Northern California have been very courageous lately I&#39;ve been here all my life and I&#39;ve never seen the cats like they&#39;ve been the last two years I&#39;ve had three conversations for they completely stood me off and I&#39;ve seen or caught cats watching me at least a dozen times never before has it been like this be careful
BearSpray... quick little &quot;Psst!&quot;... done.
Here kitty BIG kitty...WOW!!!
I keep reading that this mtn lion could have killed you etc. But there is no way in hell this lion would have attacked with two humans present. I&#39;m sure it was aware you can&#39;t watch your back in fight mode. Thus is chose to keep out of reach where it could easily run away if need be. Period.
That cat was sizing you up for a meal dude.  Normally they will not stay put that long in close proximity to humans.  You were both very lucky.  If you had been solo hiking this could have ended up very badly.  Having both of you there was probably intimidating to the cat.
The lion was obviously aware of the people and fleed to higher ground. I think in this particular situation the lion was more afraid of the people at first. When they followed it they soon understood what they were dealing with
awwww big cat!
Catch him in an Ultra Ball!!
Sadly the only advised plan to defend against a mountain lion is to fight back. Don&#39;t run, don&#39;t play dead.. whistling won&#39;t do shit... you gotta fight it.. there&#39;s a video of a cyclist riding trough the trials of Alberta when he realized 3 mountain lion&#39;s were eyeing him up. He&#39;s lucky he had mace on him.. these 2 guys were way too curious and had a very curious kitty checking them out.
Dang it camo&#39;d with the orange tree, I would have been carrying a shot gone to blast it to pieces.. Its a beautiful animal but I&#39;d want to conserve my own life instead of his..
You did well. But this was not an aggressive encounter. If it was aggressive, you would do better to make yourself bigger by raising your arms and hiking poles (if any). That cat was defensive for some reason, possibly a cub nearby. As you will note here, if you are ever attacked by a mountain lion it is likely to come from above. But again, this was not an aggressive encounter because you will not see the cat prior to a real attack.
Very cool, we just crossed paths with one today. It was exhilarating, she must&#39;ve been looking for water in this drought. She came up over a very large tree on the ground and I heard the two front paws hit the ground, she was so startled by us that me, the dog and her just stared at each other! Absolutely amazing animal! Our dog is 50 lbs and she looked like a lap dog compared to the cougar.
Wow, a friend and I exited the HST at Crescent Meadow just the day before. No lion encounters thankfully - glad you guys are safe, way to stay collected!
These hikers are damned lucky they didn&#39;t have a small child hiking with them or we would have been reading of another mountain lion attack.  Its easy to imagine how kids would run ahead or lag behind making a perfect meal for these animals.<br><br>Reading some of the comment here is mind blowing.  &quot;Theres a cub near by&quot;,  &quot;I think I heard a cub nearby&quot;, &quot;They pursued it&quot;  what a bunch of morons, you don&#39;t know any of that.  There is NO cub nearby and they weren&#39;t pursuing anything.  They noticed the animal earlier as stated and one of them didn&#39;t believe the other, it was stalking them and in a position to attack/ambush/pounce on them.  Mountain Lions are Apex predators.  They aren&#39;t cute and cuddly like a house cat.  They don&#39;t have human emotions or Walt Disney human traits, they live to eat at the top of the food chain.  20-30 yrs from now hiking in any wilderness area will be totally dangerous adventure to the point only a few will even try .  Maybe mountain lions will learn City Dwellers make a fine meal, one could only hope. ;)
Wow!
Another tactic is to make a lot of noise and make yourself appear larger by raising up your jacket, or shirt if you don&#39;t have a jacket on. Carry an item that can easily be very loud, especially with two people, she will be even less likely to attack. Mountain lions have attacked and killed people in several occasions and they tend to do it from higher ground than you or from behind, so that they can quickly grab your neck and break it or suffocate you. If they feel that you would be more of a challenge than she cares to risk, she will more likely move on. They care about their own safety too. They were good to put distance without turning their backs. I don&#39;t know that I would care to move forward and put more distance between me and safety and more room for her to be between it. What an amazing experience to look back on once you&#39;ve made it safely.
i read this news in UC Browser and im very scared after i see this video. 😯
This is so stunningly beautiful and terrifying at the same time . I&#39;d shit my pants
Kids, this is why when you see a mountain lIon on a trail, you don&#39;t follow it...unless you are drunk, then anything is possible.
For more info on the High Sierra Trail, see: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/HighSierraTrail/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/HighSierraTrail/</a>
Wow, that&#39;s crazy!  I think me and my family were on that same trail years ago.  I&#39;ll have to post the bear video from the meadow some day.
Cool Brian, I read about this on <a href="http://mymotherlode.com/">myMotherLode.com</a>, (local news) but wanted to see this full screen. My dogs and I surprised one (or vise versa I should say) up near Ironstone (vineyards) on our morning walk. The dogs didn&#39;t chase her, they obeyed but by the time I pulled out the phone she was long gone. <br> Nice job man, and thanks.
I would&#39;ve broken out my laser pointer
Have you seen some stairs?
Trying to camouflage himself next to the brush.
They mostly come out at night mostly.....
I literally went on the high Sierra trek with my Boy Scout troop half a day after this happened, I remember that trail. XD
My instinct would have been to YELL at the cat, to try and chase it off.  Let me see what my research concludes: yup, yell at it....and create distance, AND, don&#39;t turn your back.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJxDWX-qes&amp;t=92">1:32</a> WHOA CUBS IN THE AREA!!!
Great video! A beautiful creature!
&quot;What are we supposed to do?&quot;<br><br>Maybe not walk towards it? lol.
oh wow! I would be so scared but its amazing! Thanks for posting!
This is one of my favorite videos, love you two guys talking  and remaining so calm and cool, you both were awesome and I love the mountain lion too. So cool! Thank you.
Inside Edition squad? Anyone?
That&#39;s an excited look on the cat&#39;s face. It isn&#39;t necessarily an aggressive look, it&#39;s the look you&#39;d see in between a &quot;meh&quot; look, and an, &quot;I&#39;m going to eat you&quot; look.
Wow--while you got an incredible experience and video, you are very, very lucky. You challenged that lion to a fight by pursuing it down the trail like that. Had you not spotted it up there (and just continued down the trail in pursuit), you likely wouldn&#39;t be here, as it would&#39;ve ambushed you from above. You were smart to remain calm and back off, but you were unbelievably foolish to follow the cat in the first place. The wildlife are not there for your pleasure; they exist for their own sake. Be respectful next time.
Not a situation anyone should find themselves in - very dangerous. Beautiful cat!!
I guess I can&#39;t complain too much, he at least turned the phone into landscape view when shooting. However, probably should have not digitally zoomed even if it made the cat look closer. &quot;What are we supposed to do, back up?&quot; Hah!
Can I share this on Facebook?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJxDWX-qes&amp;t=53">0:53</a>   &#39;&#39;what are we supposed to do?&#39;&#39;     <br>    You&#39;re supposed to make kissing sounds &amp; say &#39;come on kitty,   here kitty&#39;   kiss kiss &#39; then try to rub it&#39;s belly
Amazing encounter and thank you for sharing. Definitely memorable! That must have freaked you both out when you spotted it up on that outcrop!
That was very foolish.  A u-turn and possibly even a return to camp would have been the prudent move.  You were very lucky.
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?!?!?!!!!!!
Around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJxDWX-qes&amp;t=83">1:23</a> mark you can start to hear a loud chirp. Cubs make that similar noise. You might have been really lucky not to have walked on.
It&#39;s funny because mountain lions are actually very dangerous , like they could rip out your throat if they wanted to or just eat you because they are incredibly strong and won&#39;t stop attacking you as easily as a bear
Wrong neighborhood boys, lol. In all seriousness, you didn&#39;t run and you gave it distance which was a good call.
You are extremely lucky I know predators he or she probably stalked you for a good mile before loosing interest next time back away while makinh yourself look big hollar yell and scream I&#39;m glad your all okay
Such a good looking <a href="http://cat.you/">cat.You</a> are lucky to have seen it.
Wondering what cusses you cut out of the audio, hehehe. Thanks for sharing this video. And you were correct not to run.
you&#39;re lucky he didn&#39;t rip you to shreds!
Beautiful
That&#39;s fucking amazing! I would have ran. Ain&#39;t never met a mountain lion I couldn&#39;t out run.
did you dieded?
Clever girl
Amazing scenes... but you and your friend were both VERY lucky to have escaped that encounter without incident. Female mountain lions are extremely protective of their young, so if it&#39;s true that there were cubs in the vicinity, you should NEVER have proceeded up that trail once you saw the mother. I&#39;m happy you both lived to tell the tale, but for anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation, PLEASE do not make this mistake. Having a smartphone in hand does NOT make you either a trained naturalist or a animal behaviorist. You are an outsider intruding on the cats domain, and that makes you both a potential threat and prey. This could have been a very different video with very different outcome...
that&#39;s why I always carry an empty box or, christmas wrapping paper with me when I hike... anyone that knows cat behavior knows your house cat will jump into any box randomly placed on the floor or, attack wrapping paper
I&#39;ve ran across a cat with a cub in the Sierras.  Just kept stepping and ignored them both.  Momma wasn&#39;t happy and growled at me, but I didn&#39;t act like prey, nor did I stop to make a goodbye video, rofl.  Great vid, but don&#39;t act like seeing one of natures perfect killing machine is a reason to start writing wills and obituaries.  Act like sheep and you will attract a wolf...or a cat.  Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Amazing how it camouflages itself against the dead tree, hope they left her be.
You were in grave danger.  This mountain lion was ready to kill you.  As soon as you saw it on the trail you should have walked slowly backwards in the other direction.
Does that rock look like a dinosaur head?
This is insane! I camped out in that area just last weekend. Glad you guys are safe.
I wonder if the result would have been different if he&#39;d been hiking alone.
That cat was in position to pounce. Cocked and loaded, no doubt! They made the right decision to back away. Actually,  following it was probably not the best idea...
did you have a weapon?
I&#39;ve encountered one like this, it was screaming for its mate or something and I thought my little brother was playing a joke. Turns out he was still at the house, and I come within 5 yards of a behemoth. All I really remember is how huge and muscular the shoulders were, and how I had no chance if it attached. So I kept walking except I held up my arms and screamed in the same way she did, except in a more angry and defensive tone, if that makes any sense. After she was out of sight I ran faster then I&#39;ve ever ran in my life, and it induced an asthma attack. Really unlucky day for me
What an amazing encounter to have and come out unscathed!
When you see a mountain lion.. DON&#39;T follow it, walk slowly backwards like they did, And never turn your back to it.
I wonder if it is the same lion that was on the trail?
&quot;What are you supposed to do?&quot;<br><br>Well, I can tell you you AREN&#39;T supposed to purposely follow and creep up on a freaking mountain lion! This is like picking up a rattlesnake and wondering why it bite you or purposely jumping out and scaring a bear. Come on, guys.
Should link the bear and rattlesnake video as well .What are the odds in 2 days to get all 3 up close? Hec of a hike !  Lucky the bear was busy with bugs!
You know, there is a mountain lion living in Griffith Park in LA. It hasn&#39;t eaten anyone yet and it&#39;s been there for a few years.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJxDWX-qes&amp;t=42">0:42</a> BOOOOO!!!!  😂 this dude is dumb look how it&#39;s just so focus ..i would&#39;ve been Dinner already!!
What are we suposed to do??? Throw something at it ,be the agressor. Yell at it and stomp your feet. Grab a stick and throw it at the thing. Haha
You should know that the best thing to do when you see a cougar is to shriek like a girl and run slowly in the opposite direction, leaving your arms dangle like a tasty treat.
why would they follow it? did he have a gun? if he had a gun that meant he would have had to kill it had it attacked. which means he was willing risk having to kill it to get a close  video. i hope he didn&#39;t have a gun and was just really stupid, bc if he did have a gun that&#39;s pretty uncool to care more about getting a video than an animal&#39;s life.
That girl was going to roll you down the mountain side behind you as you walked by if you ask me she was sitting in the favorite position for attack, but I suppose she COULD have been one of them super forgiving never hungry or defensive types,,,,,,NOT!   Not cool if yoiu hadn&#39;t seen her or if she knew you hadn&#39;t seen her I wonder how this story might have become?
The moment when you realize humans weren&#39;t always on the top of the food chain.
A stunning animal.
Looks and behaves female to me.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJxDWX-qes&amp;t=120">2:00</a> and THAT is why they have survived for millions of years.  you think you&#39;re following it, suddenly its on highground following you.
It ran away at first(not that scared. It was just willing to give you room).  Then, it sensed you were maybe after it; it stopped to stand his/her ground. I saw nothing aggressive in his/her eyes.
That&#39;s very surprising that the mountain lion didn&#39;t run off when you made noise (plus appeared larger while remaining calm. Those are proper responses to a cougar encounter).<br><br>It seems like this is one of those rare cats which display aberrant behavior (i.e. not running when humans make noise, activity in daylight-they&#39;re primarily nocturnal animals)<br><br>But I&#39;m glad it ended well for you guys! <br><br>I encountered a mountain lion in the Fall/2011 when going on a walk at midnight. He thankfully was a good distance away and the house three houses up from me had the garage door up. Had the cat charged, I&#39;d have just gone into the garage, close the door, then call Dept. of Fish &amp; Game. He just stared at me for about 10 seconds before proceeding back into the creek....now that was a typical encounter (run into at night, lion was apprehensive and retreated to end the encounter). <br><br>They are usually easy to scare off but the issue is remembering what to do in that heat of the moment
Mountain lions roam Boulder, CO streets -- They only eat deer -
Given the odd behavior of the animal and the time of year, do you think it was showing signs of rabies?
hehe scary stuff.
Interesting! It did not seem afraid and was more curious about you guys. Strange. Doesn&#39;t seem like a place it&#39;d see a lot of humans and be use to them. That&#39;s mountain lions for you though.
This is an amazing video. Thanks for posting it.
Always, ALWAYS - bring a laser pointer...
Why did you follow that Lion instead of backing away? Had you gotten ahead of that lion, theirs no telling if she would have attacked you while your back was turned.
If observation of wild cats are any indication, she behaved as if she thought you had not spotted her, and was safely observing up close, unrecognized by you. Thus she was not as skittish about your presence as it she normally would have been. <br><br>If she was seeking a kill she would have adopted a crouching position to maximize the surprise element. That down low, ears cocked stance is one all cat species seem to share from the house cat to the lion and tiger when ready to pounce on unsuspecting, close in prey. Regardless, I&#39;d have been scared shitless too.
The biggest wildlife zone in California. Greets from SD
She looks young to me. Maybe a juvenile. What a beautiful experience
So obviously you had to go somewhere and maybe even forward at some point.  What did you do?
I recognize the cat&#39;s expression. Curiosity. That&#39;s what my house cat looks like when I&#39;m on the other side of the room doing something unusual or making a weird noise, and he&#39;s thinking, &quot;Hey! Whatcha doin&#39; over there?&quot;
Thanks KSBW for posting this story on the news...Glad you guys made it safe..No don&#39;t run....Know before hand when hiking in trails!Seem as large as possible. ...Make noise. ...Act defiant, not afraid. ... Slowly create distance. ... Protect yourself.
I feel like that puma should learn gang signs representing &quot;High Sierra Trail&quot;, both for pride in its geographical area and a warning to passersby to stay the f*ck out of High Sierra Trail.
Great that you are safe!<br>But Brian stick to your guns and don&#39;t give away your video for free to the news! The National ones like that &#39;KTLA and our Tribune affiliates&#39; below will make an easy 300,000 off your video on TV plus the net!
Bunch of kiddos. As a level 10 redditeur(notice how I spell it), a simple unsheathing of the blade would have had this pussy cat running with its tail between its legs. No amount of primal theatrics from this simple creature would have shaken me. I always trust in the blade when slicing down my foes.
Khajitt has the coins ...
Excellent video.  Seen many things on trails all over the country but that&#39;s the best Mt Lion video.  You must have been stoked!  Thanks for sharing.  Awesome creature!
Wow!! She looked like a statue perched up on the rock.
I&#39;m surprised they weren&#39;t sure if the should run or not.  NEVER turn your back on a wild animal.  If they had missed it and just walked by, can&#39;t say for sure if the cat wouldn&#39;t have attacked them from the back.  A beautiful, well fed animal though.  For the 2 guys, well-fed is a good thing!
Impressive animal.  Also impressive are the number of dead/dying trees.  The Pine Bark Beetle continues its massive decimation.
You news stations never credit the actual content owner when you broadcast on the news. You always credit Youtube, but not the person who risked their life to get the footage.
SO nice to see humans act reasonably and rationally and not make things worse for wildlife. Way to go, Guys!
Mountain Lion encounter 101: 1. Tie raw steaks to your neck. 2. Appear as small as possible.  3. Crouch into a compact ball and roll away in a frantic convulsion.  The sheer stupidity of these steps may confuse the animal into submission.
You guys were super respectful to her, thank you :)  if she was actually going to attack you, she wouldn&#39;t have been so out in the open.  I think she was protecting her cubs.   Great encounter I&#39;ll bet you never forget it!
Just don&#39;t threaten the cat
incredible to watch, could hardly breathe once you spot her up the rocks. glad you&#39;re safe👍
The mountain lion remained visible because she has a cub in the area, otherwise she would have slipped off in to the brush. It&#39;s watching the human to decide whether it poses a threat to her cub.<br><br>Rather than stand there and record the mountain lion, the polite thing to do would have been to continue on and ignore the creature.
This awesome. Maybe, she had eaten.
You are CRAZY for following her! You are very lucky people that nothing worse happened
Congratulations most don&#39;t live to tell a tale thanks for sharing I think this is the most I&#39;ll get to one.
Wow!
This is amazing, thank you so much for sharing.
kitty!!!!
that looks very very very intense... did she eventually go away even after you guys retreated?
How&#39;d you end up continuing? Wait for him/her to move? I&#39;m soloing the HST later this year.
