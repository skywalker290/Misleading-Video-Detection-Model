One thing that i have seen in Sushant singh rajput that he is not a pessimist as many other actors are
What a jewel we lost, each time I see his interviews(which only we have) i just admire the range of knowledge and intelligence he had. Justice for SSR
He always alives in our Heart❤
Wow just wow, I’m here in 2024. Last part really hit me. This is how we have to be. Thanks supper star,
Sushant ❤️
Sushant is claustrophobic
I&#39;m watching in 2024 and still missing him... Really he is so intelligent 😊❤️💫
His voice is so calming. Miss you Sushaant❤❤
I have been watching his interviews on repeat mode from 2 years
😭😭😭😭

Thank you niranjan.  We come back here again and again. For SSR
Ssr’s voice is like akashvani
Chara goru<br>⚖️
They are so many lagends in industry but srk Salman Amitabh Aamir sab fail h ssr ki approach ka aage ..😢
Kash ankita se he shaadi kar le ta
I am still coming here and admiring Sushant...you are an inspiration SSR... Really m still learning from you...
May his soul rest in peace. Love you Sushant Singh Rajput!❤️
For once if u forget while listening him that he not here anymore, but then the sudden reminder of his horiific death give a shock... What a pathetic situation when u know, he, has been killed but still can&#39;t find who did this and why 💔<br>It&#39;s very cruel. He was eliminated in ugly way...
He was so honest and Bollywood culprits cannot handle it! All of them ate sooooo fake even now!
Смотришь на Сушанта и душа радуется,жаль что он не с нами.Правосудия для Сушанта.
😭😭😭💔💔💔♥️
He actually spoke his Heart out😊😊😊
Love u heart
I am listening to this interview second time (I have just listened to it and went to the start immediately again)... And I am like, F***!!! he said everything he wanted in this life and no one listened to him? No one could hear him? He was a child, he would always be a honest child. and he didn&#39;t want much from life, HE JUST WANTED TO COMMUNICATE... and they didn&#39;t answer his calls (he is actually saying this in one of his interviews)... Or it&#39;s just that, they understood him very well and used this against him and made him an outsider and destroyed him....
All of his interviews are so honest and I learn so much about human being nature....  What does he say in Hindi about his and Ankita&#39;s relationships? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=970">16:10</a> Can anyone translate it for me? Please Please Please &lt;3
We missed you sush you are the best 🤍🙏🌟

😏: I was pampered by the elders so that I cannot rebel, but I constantly proved throughout life to the society that I was a rebel under disguise of an introvert. How&#39;s that? .

Every one jealous of him
Niranjan is so refreshing.. Liked this interview.. So honest pleasanr and different questions
He was so passionate abt acting.. Can really get this from his communication.. He just truly loved what he was doing he was head over heels in love with ot
Niranjan is bang on.. The point I made below was before niranjans observation.. He just hit the nail there.. Just a good observatinist like me and also like his no nonsense approach where he doesn&#39;t seem to believe sushants story and is out right about it not saying aushant is lying but it&#39;s said that the parents weree seperate
I can never understand sushants logic abt being Introverted because he was pampered.. If ur a pampered child ur more confident and extroverted as ur family is always there for u.. An introvert is someone who loses confidence due to family being strict or harsh on him or some issues like seperattion of parents dominating siblings... I&#39;m a psycolvist hence the observation
Msd hairstyle suits well for this legend😀😃

So sushant said he was claustrophobic and Insommnia...and later depression..rest is history..

Sometimes I cried hard, like hell... Why sushant why 🥺 ... Missing u give me sleepless night, with thousand of thoughts... Why this happen buddy... Just can&#39;t control on destiny and it hurts...

He can never commit suicide..
He meant stop growing from the character Manav. That&#39;s true for years and years Balaji lead chracters don&#39;t  get to explore new roles being stuck in a show for more than a year. He was intelligent in realizing it pretty soon he wasn&#39;t insecure about his popularity or another person stepping into his shoes. You are missed man. I wish you could have understood your importance.
Thank God Niranjan you were too good. We need more. Please get Radhika Madan, Taapse Pannu, Raj Kumar Rao
Bs chahte h ki tmhe aur kareeb se jaane... <br>Tmse sb kch jane tmse baat krke... <br>Ek lamha baithe aur tmhare dil ki baat sune... <br>Tmhe aur janana chahte h hm...

&#39;We should reward excellent failure and punish mediocre success.&#39;<br>Sushant Singh Rajput
Very sorry for his departure.
Salute Sushant to your honest sayings
I wish I would have seen this interview when he was alive
🎊🎉🎇🙂Happy new year 2022✨💥🎉🎊 to SSR &amp; everyone..👍
A pleasure to watch &amp; re-watch interviews of Sushant Singh Rajput .<br>He prefers to not beat around the bush, absolutely honest, no pretense,  or fancy airs , despite making it to the top, always very clear about what  he wants to take up &amp; never hesitating to put in herculean efforts to do justice to all of the projects he did. One never knew much about him, as he avoided publicity &amp; never believed in being in the face. What I do know about him post June 2020 is enough to make me an ardent admirer &amp; supporter of the movement for his justice .
Most Bollywood actors are busy getting high on drugs and partying and getting sloshed. Who would have time enough to sit with this beautiful intelligent man and listen to him speak about Time, Space and Physics or anything philosophical? 🙂 Most people in Bollywood, including our cringe host Janice&#39;s Sequeira thought that something was wromg with &quot;him&quot;, not that they themselves were too dim to understand this man. :)<br><br>I still believe Sushant would&#39;ve been alive if only he had the right circle of friends. He had all the things in the world, fame, fortune, brains. But he didn&#39;t have great company. :) Everyone isolated him to a corner because no one could relate to him. Add to that his existing introvert nature. :) It&#39;s just shameful.<br><br>Please, anyone who reads this... If you see a friend or a collegue who&#39;s a loner, sits alone, and is unable to mix with anyone... Do take the initiative to try to talk to them. You never know, maybe that&#39;s what they&#39;re looking for. Do it before one more life is lost. Psychological trauma is a big thing, it can definitely push people to the edge. Don&#39;t let that happen.<br><br>God bless you Sushant. ♥ You&#39;ll always be in our hearts till we die. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bollywood">#Bollywood</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sushantsinghrajput">#SushantSinghRajput</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rip">#RIP</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ssr">#SSR</a>

Never ever seen honest interview like this one.I m not totally cofident that his all words are true because I don&#39;t know him personally. But from his expression and gesture it gives me confidence that he was saying all words true and from heart. It is true that in today&#39;s world people of great and good heart can&#39;t survive in the world
Love you and miss you Sushant 😥 justice for Sushant 🙏
Dearest sush a lot of evidence is there that proves they killed u but u can&#39;t get justice because this is India, and this is a world of devil, vultures. Can&#39;t tell you how much we are mourning for u.
Very nice and knowledgeable interview.

After meeting SSR I&#39;m sure that interviewer would hv changed his looks.. just to step up near to  SSR.. 🤓 very charming SSR.. I regret  that charm is no more 🥺😭
I think he was lucky with ankita and happy too but that rhea ruined him
Msg for all, yesterday night Sushant came in dream want to convey his msg.-<br>&quot; All this which is happening is dikhawa. Don&#39;t waste your time by chasing them. M happy as my life was BIG. I just want to say that if you love me then start making life big by being a giver. Don&#39;t shed tears rather do something for society. &quot;<br>Several times i saw him in dream with 3 more souls- Asif Basra sir, Disha &amp; Manu ( my childhood friends brother who was just 26 years old &amp; passed away in Aug 2020.
It&#39;s one year now.SSR was about to die last year around this time.if only God was on his side,the sweet soul would have got saved
Can&#39;t believe he has gone
Kitne khusmijaj ho Shushant....really....so intelligent, hard worker ......and .....and.....rare personality. I can understand this is only you.....who stormed all Bollywood from your energy.......inspirational  🙏

Justice ⚖4SSR.  Miss you ssr love you
Justice for sushant and boycott !
How pure and honest he was abt his relationship and its clear that he loved her so.much and same as from Ankita too . This Bollywood has separated them  😡😡😡 Bollywood will completely buried now . The time has came when the Bollywood is ending completely.  RIP to Bollywood
It&#39;s amazing as well as actor as intelligent scientists .more handsome and more creative person... God ne amazing boy bnaya tha...
The best interview in all Bollywood interviews of all Nd every Celebes....
Watching his charming looks and listen to his sorted conversation is a wonderful treat ♥️
Wow .....u amazing person.shezada.
Bullywood was not hell bent on killed him per se but ruining him because he was different, like Kangana. While Kangna is outspoken he was an introvert. Thses two did not agree with bigshots Karan and adithya chopra so was banned by them and their friends. The story about Drive being taken to merely dook him is so over the top but its failure and final dump into netflix affected sushant&#39;s credibility and career. He&#39;s an intellectual like Kangana. She says a lot of things without thinking twice of the consequences but I give her the benefit of doubt for thinking if he was bullied like she did and became depressed.
I miss you Sushant Singh rajput interview 👌👌👌
Thank you Sushant Singh Rajput <br>For everything!
His words about relationship with Ankita speaks loud n clear that Ankita was the one who broke the relationship out of insecurity. Very clear and loud <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=923">15:23</a> that Ankita is lieing about her relationship.
Very true process sushant was said in this interview.. <br><br>Definitely they fighted very bruetly and they was murdered. <br>....want justice for SSR
This is exactly the reason why bollywood wanted him dead!!! His brilliance in everything he did!! It was too much for them to handle!!!
After listening his feelings towards ankita I just weeped... It shows how much he love her... And what u told ankita ki usne apne carrier ke lie tmhe chora... Taali ek hth se nhi bjti... Jb koi relationship toote to khot dono me hota h... Tum koi radha jaisi premika nhi ho... Ho skta h wo shadi ke lie abhi taiyrrr na Ho he wants to focus on carrier pr usne tmhe chora nhi hoga.. A big clap for u ankita... Tm to Rhea jaisi hi nkli... Hmdrdi dikha ke uska image kharab kro... Mithi churi mara tmne... Ab to wo nhi rha media me akr acha kachra kia tmne sushant ka.. I Just want to forget ankita...ab tum hme rulane lgi ho...
Miss u SUSHANT 😭😭😭💔💔💔💔
Miss  u man
I wish tum hmesha aise hi rhte.. Khush,... Whenever I see talking about ankita I am broken.. Kismt ne kyu alg kia yrrr unhe... He literally love her....
Best interview susanta bhai
Kriti Sanon was the jinx  who came n destroyed his life and took him away from his lady luck Ankita
Sushant you are not at all bouring....the girls around u in this bollywood wanted u as just fun ..xxx  and spoil ur carrier...ur extremely  great
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1292">21:32</a> Sushant says he is claustrophobic. This debunks the narrative that murder conspiracy theorists were trying to promote.
Hi Did you guys listened??? Sushant himself admitted that he is not claustrophobic years back 😃 then all of sudden how come he become claustrophobic??? It’s very strange.. Obviously, we all know his interests of space, sky, adventures etc which already contradicts what Thai said... However, after listening this it reminded me  what she said once again. 😃😃
l deeply miss you brother Sushant
tongue slipped on sisters, spoke about Money too, He died of sisters greediness and family torture
Genius  Sushant Singh Rajput
Hamesha hamare dilon mein! The national treasure and pride of 🇮🇳! Gem 💎 of india! World 🌎 united for justice!+ bhai ur murderers will be Hanged To Death! Jai shiv shambo 🕉 🙏 💖 ✨ jan 21st 1986-infinite

Waterstones hotel?
He reminds me of playing Steve jobs character...He was perfect for that .
His voice is music to ear ❤️ Legend
Somebody clear this @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1286">21:26</a> did he say I&#39;m claustrophobic...and that&#39;s true🙄
He always preferred to listen..<br>He is an Observant..<br>U will get Justice Soon my shinning star <br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23observantssr">#ObservantSSR</a>
Sushant you looking masoom in this interview
He is just super Human for lot of reasons..<br> My role model Sushant
Nice sushant
Never heard any celebrity answering in such a sensible and making sense of whatever you are speaking that&#39;s insane there is definitely something beyond what we see
In this interview one can easily see the glow, the articulate way he is expressing himself unlike the recent ones😔

Kitno noor hai chehre par kitna aapne aap par bharosa tha kitna sapna THA jalim duniya jine nahi diya god kabhi maaf mat karna jalim ko
Great intellectual, genius, humble, innocent, diligent... soul was SSR. Every one in Bollywood might have felt insecure, envious of him... &amp; his IQ...
💖💝💞
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1310">21:50</a> ..ohh now I get where Rhea gets hint of clostophobic... Ye tab hota jab high pakage criminal lawyers hire krro
Poor guy thought she will be with him forever 😢 and says it is Inevitable and he says “WE WILL GET MARRIED” ... You are cute Sushant..  God Bless you with lots of Peace and Eternal Bliss Om Shanti ☮️
In this interview ssr was very happy. After 2017 it was change
Ankitha does not diserve ssr love
Maine life me bahut Kam log Aise dekhe Jo apni kamiyo ko batate ho .khud yeh bolna koi mere sath peaceful tarike se jyada time nahi rah sakta apni honesty se answer karna tum jaan ho mere Aur Mai kabhi tumhe Dead nahi manti tum soul me ho Aur tumhari yaad ane pe Mai tumhe sun sakti hu Kai log hote hue bhi nahi hote tum humare beech me na hokar bhi humare dilo me ho Aur hamesa rahoge love you forever
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Sushant
Watching his interview is like reading a life book
SSR family, so unlucky that they lost him at such a young age. Yet, they are soooo lucky that they have him on video for the rest of their lives. They can search for his videos on google and come up with loads and choose to believe he lives in Mumbai and is doing good work. As if, June 13th/June 14th never  happened.  I hope they find solace from these now gems.
Those who are constantly bashing ankita for being abusive, irritating, dominating, ghaati, foolish, impulsive toxic personality etc. Should watch this interview and thn judge.😠
Unbearable interview
This interview was just 3 months before he broke up with ankita in March 2016. 😢 I don&#39;t understand why sushant took such a drastic decision.!
I am watching this interview everyday😘😘❤❤💔💔💔 y he can&#39;t come back💔💔💔💔
Oye hoye hoye...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1294">21:34</a> pe Sushant  ne bola &quot;I am claustrophobic &quot; Tai ne yahi se statement uthayi...lekin  koi uss dumb aunty ko bataye ki game the yeh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He wanted girls around.Why??<br>People ask many times. <br>Answer according to is👇<br>Because a child feels protected when he is protected by mother or sister.Sushant was only son of his parents and only brother id 4 sisters.<br>In the environment of engineering college he was missing that protection.
listen to 10.17😀
SSR well educated young boy.coming form northen Índia.tru SSR case  130 cores have learned a lot.young Youth Will be aware before dealing with someone
So cute😚😚😚
So humble...so cute
LOVE YOU SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT ❤️❤️❤️.

Let&#39;s keep our faith n trust in the Supreme Soul who is Just n  delivers justice. Justice for SSR is coming soonest! Amen.
I had watched this interview on TV ... on 13th June 2020 ... it was coming late at night..and the next day I heard the news...have been shell shocked since then
NCB bhi bik chuki hai Bullyweed ko. Kitna mila 10 crore??? Sharam karo. Kangana should run KBC. Bullyweed goons active here. Boycott nashedi, ganjedi, zhihadi, Bullywood <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#JUSTICEFORSSR</a> AND DISHA. Boycott Bullywood 60 years
He said Ankita is very excited to be with him so I can&#39;t take chance I&#39;m always confused about his feelings for Ankita in initial years he was completely in love with Ankita later I felt he slowly move away from her I don&#39;t know what about his feelings for her in this interview he clearly stated as I&#39;m happily surprised she want to be with me so I want to be insecure and want to be with her. In one of article interview in 2015 he said I&#39;m lucky to have Ankita in my life and I would be stupid if I give up on girl like Ankita in future. She should get an award for being with me since 6.5 years. Before say anything bad comments about Ankita just remember one thing she&#39;s loved Sushant when he was upcoming actor not The star Sushant Sing Rajput. She deserves to be respected for true love for Sushant  I don&#39;t know why people are targeting unnecessarily they both moved on in life and they have mutual respect for each other. So better stop talking ill about her and him. We can share opinions but going too personal is wrong. After breakup he said in an article interview about Ankita that &quot;I stayed with Ankita for 7 years, there are very few things I would be reminded before dying definitely this would be one of them in a good way&quot; ---- This statements proves about their relationship purity ❤️ I&#39;m sharing this because I would be happy if people stop judging their relationship. Destiny is above anything no matter what you plan it will take you to the final destination 💔😞.
His smile is worth of million 👍🏼
Unbelievable his such a sweetheart &amp; an honourable person 😭😭😢😢miss him . Lord shiva 🪔🪔 get justice for SSR, pure soul🙏🙏
Hurts hurts .....💔
What a star what a humble person! You are above all n will always be!👍
Sushant you will get justice 🙏
By 2020, they started fighting with him, killed him and didn&#39;t let him reach where he wanted 😔
Lagtahi nhi ki ssr is duniya me nhi he😢😢inki boli se saf pta chlta he ki kitne masum the vo😥😓
The way sushant answers all questions shows that not only he had a passion and was talented.. He was a good human being and very intelligent. Which a lot of actors nowadays do not have. You will be missed forever and ever dear sushant by millions of people . Nobody can erase those memories. You are a real superstar. Justice for ssr....
I&#39;m sure all the bollywood jerks must have been scared of his intelligence, talent  and honesty because this is what they lack. Karan Johar had never invited Sushant on his show instead he.made fun of him that is because Karan and his so called bollywood buddies could not even reach quarter of Sushant&#39;s IQ.  Only brainless people like Alia, Kareena, Sonam, Deepika, Shahid, Akshay, Varun and the Khan&#39;s are called. Justice for Sushant

he has such a beautiful smile, and so beautiful eyes.  i remember somebody from bullyweed called him a truckdriver. are varun dhavan or joker ranveer singh  better than him
He was very happy with their relationship in nov &#39;15 n by nov &#39;16 they were done with their relationship...y?? What went wrong ?? Did he get carried away by his success ?? <br>His style of speaking is so genuine
I am watching this interview for the fifth time..just to hear his voice n talk about Ankita
missed you more after watching this interview rest in peace
Sushant ,I feel is the best example of how wonderful a human being can be.....We have lost such a gem!!
You’re such a good soul. God bless you forever!! May God never forgive the evil people who planned and executed your murder because of vindictiveness, big egos and extreme jealousy (read Salman Khan).
Why everyone wannabe Sasta karan chakka
Why u were honest. This world is full of vultures.  It’s not like u. Why u disclosed u are emotional and vulnerable
Everytime these vultures are like - oh you don’t speak too much ,
You aren’t any introvert,,you gave wrong introduction my brother
Keeping mum is better than speaking senseless bullshit ,like most of bragging bullyweediyas do. ,,huh u won’t understand genius
I really blv he was not the one who broke the relationship
Tumhare sare interview repeat me dekh chuki hu .. dil se chahti hoo ki kash koi naya interview aaye..par ye hamari badkismati h ki ye kabhi na ho payega..

Miss u sushant
People r so jelous that don&#39;t let other people live happily. Ratio  of bad people r very high. Because of jealousy they ruin somebody&#39;s life. Their earning methods r also very bad. They r not true people. We hv to be very careful about them as well we hv to judge them.
His description of the journey from beloved youngest brother of four bright sisters, to introvert who did well to dancer to his final choice of stage and further, so very clear!<br><br>He declined half a dozen regular films, road to middle of the road stardom, and was set to go to UCLAinstead, but then accepted kph. Industry wanted only dumb dolls! Hence his ouster. <br><br>This was after his NASA sojourn? The U.S. accent isn&#39;t fake.
This is a 2015 interview.<br>🍎.<br>Watch the Post Kedarnath interview.<br>2018. 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌<br>Who should we turn to for the difference.<br>The stress, strain, and many more things clearly show. But we go on .😎.<br>Performance in a movie can go on by retaking.<br>But inner self and health conditions decline.<br>And everyone is not alike <br>*.<br>Is it the actor or the industry only to blame.<br>Better, if we wake up to REALITY AND, <br>HOW MONEY ROTATION AND POWER CLUTCHES HAS DETERIORATED THE CITY &amp; the industry too.<br>*.<br>Listening.<br>*.
&amp; ....... Now?.<br>Now that you are free to have whatever you want,<br>YOU ARE IN SO MANY ,<br>YOU DID A SKY DIVE ..... TO SPLASH OUT TRUTH.<br>SOME THINK,<br>physical being is compulsory for completing life.<br>It&#39;s easier , definitely , if you are present and be , do , smile , cry , work , with the human as a finite.<br>But,<br>If some people want to test god,<br>The test is going on SUSHANT.<br>AND RESULTS ARE BETTER THESE DAYS <br>*.<br>Is it still LADY SHRIRAM , Miranda House ,<br>Is it girls that makes you feel empty, if they are absent from ➡️ HOME.<br>*.<br>Stay in peace with us.<br>*.
Mis u sushant

Love you ❤️ Sushant. Be happy, stay blessed, wherever you are.
He was so much in love with Ankita. But he forgot her and went after bpllywoods glamarous girls who dumped him. He was not able to handle his sudden success in bollywood  Had he stayed on with Ankita , today he would have been one of the successful stars in Bollywood  with a clean image and would not have got the image of womaiser and what mot
love u sir
Sushant you were amazing intelligent person and good human
We have lost a beautiful guy.
Ye agar aaj hota to bhi meri life aise hi hoti but kyu lagta hai kuch adura hai, couldn&#39;t listen him at that time
Such a clear headed and sorted person about everything. The level of maturity sense of humor humble attitude totally mind blown also sad that we didn’t cherish him when he was alive. I do believe he will be returned to us in such phenomenal manner that all the evil people will be squashed. Till then May he rest in peace.🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Justice for sushant love you❤

Amazing personality. Taken away from us too early.
Too intelligent for bullywood. You great ssr

Four months going on five months I feel like his soul won&#39;t get justice barely hearing anything about his case now😢😢
Sad...We lost such a darling person....may rest his soul in peace.we miss you ssr
&#39;Nobody will stay as long as Ankita has&#39;<br>You were correct Dear Sushant.
To all those who are saying that he admitted to being claustrophobic in this video ...kindly read this ... I am sure if you believe him when he says he had it ...you would also believe him when he said he overcame it prior to joining the movies: <a href="https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/interview-i-don-t-even-compete-with-myself-sushant-singh-rajput-2283323.......">https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/interview-i-don-t-even-compete-with-myself-sushant-singh-rajput-2283323.......</a>. Besides as far as Modafinil is concerned : &quot;Modafinil is used to treat excessive sleepiness caused by narcolepsy (a condition that causes excessive daytime sleepiness)&quot;  a simple fact check or google search can tell you as much but he clearly says that he is an insomniac and sleeps only 2-3 hours a day , then why would he need a medicine for excessive sleep? Besides he was never afraid of flying as she had also stated as he wanted his own flying license ...and do read up the information passed in public domain by Dr. Harish Shetty, the doctor she mentioned ...he in a series of tweets clearly maintained that he didn&#39;t find anything wrong with Sushant Singh Rajput upon meeting him -- you could look him up on twitter to check what he posted !!
Sushant will always remain in our heart. Guys, do watch this lovely tribute to Sushant Singh Rajput and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dilbechara">#DilBechara</a> movie at.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHj2avDj4zk">https://youtu.be/mHj2avDj4zk</a><br>And do share if you like it.
While listening to sushant, it seems that he reflects me... but he was MashaaAllah so well versed to understand it n say what we only feel...<br>So yes sushant sometimes we get what we want but still we don&#39;t get excited n the hollowness increase n deepens wd every wish being fulfilled n u ask urself y am nt happy<br>Y
Sushant got killed by R bitch
Now he is what i call a Roll Model. All rounder and excellent in All Fields. Wow.
My god their relationship ❤❤❤❤
What a cheerful person he was! He knew what he wanted in life. What a solid relationship he had with Ankita! Difficult to believe that relationship broke! Yes. It was done by someone purposely to make Sushanth weak. Ankita was a strong girl. She hid her tears and survived! But Sushanth on the other side became weaker and weaker.... trusted all the worthless characters..... all were only using him and his money! Finally brutally murdered and dumped him! His life is a big lesson for youngsters....exposing the weakness... in wrong company.... will destroy anyone. Anyways..... it’s very sad to think about his life! My sincere prayers to God is May his soul Rest In Peace. His smiling face no one can forget!
One of the best interview of sushant...
sushant sir good <br>very nice Interview<br>lovly smile
He seemed so much in love with Ankita and so happy ... Then why did he leave Ankita? Wish he hadn&#39;t left her... He would have lived now
Everyone spoke about the brilliance of Sushant in this interview, and rightly so. He was way ahead of all other actors. But I feel we should applaud the interviewer too for being genuinely attentive and allowing the actor to speak his heart out without interjecting him.
Miss you Sushant ...you were really out of this world...
so unfair :&#39;( ................such an intelligent well read man. such a waste ....... his life was taken away.......so much potential as a human being!!!!!!!! Heart breaks thinking how his family must be feeling. I pray he gets justice.
Your Life compels people to rethink about the importance of having Dreams,  Humanity,  Innocence and Pureheartedness in Human Life......SSR You are indeed a Great Soul...😊🙏
Love you son
I miss you sushand😘😓

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ankitha you could save him 😭😱
I wish you would have survived Sushant..I wish God has given you life to fulfill all the dreams you saw..you were supposed to live n love n be happy..this is so unfair God
Here ssr looks like Ronan doll foot ball player
Had he married to Ankita..his future could have been differently super 😢
Sushant has set an example by sacrificing Himself....<br>1) Intelligence and self esteem  has zero value in Bollywood  run by druggies..(You need to be perfect only in चापलूसी !!!)<br>2)Stay away from politics and bollywood if you are not ready to compromise your ethics.<br>3) Don&#39;t trust blindly on people based on their stories about themselves or our assumptions about them.(diaRhea and gang)<br>4) Create a safe escape route if you still don&#39;t have to follow above rules.
14.54, watch, now all are fighting and will get what we want
Good interview.. The interviewer.. His understanding on things.. Now people fighting for you..
very intelligent so cute, but q kiya sushant sir k sath buhat hi bura kiya hai sir k sath, i hope k God sushant sir ko insaf dilaige,or sir ko marne walo ko zaror saza milegi,
Stunning and an super intelligent Mr. Sushant Singh Rajput ❤. Justice for Mr Sushant Singh Rajput ⭐<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#Justice4SSR</a> 🇳🇿
You can do anything successfully. If possible pl. Come back.
Look at the way he dresses, the way he talks, his voices...so smooth and decent...
Will u give the t-shirt to sushanth fans
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1288">21:28</a> He speaks about being Claustrophobic
Justice for ssr.
How much honest he is, he never hides his relationship with Ankita. He loves Ankita a lot. I wish they will meet in next life
Sushant is a dream boy,, actually dream come true boy😍😇
He is no more in this world
God take me, please send back Sushant.. he&#39;s best person, he will be helpful to world 😭
Smart, intelligent,  educated person in the Bollywood. So entire Bollywood mafa &amp; druggie are jealous about him.
His eyes,are deprived of sleep.this was the time of dhoni.he was working really hard.
He loved Ankita so much.Then wt happened?
I can’t really make out what’s happened to them during 3 months . He talked so confidently about their relationship and in a 3 months broke up. How so great love could stop surviving 🤯😭.

Really very polite and .......no words to narrate him......he has everything in him..........
Shusant you are the best with genius actor in film industry anyone cannot be like you shusant .we can&#39;t forget your innocent smile you are one of the best shus we will remember you always.💗
He had insomnia
Such a charming soul❤️❤️❤️may his soul rest in peace
A beautiful human being. ❤️  So sad that he&#39;s already gone. 😟
He is much more intelligent than people in the Bollywood.....
So lovely person he was
So inspiring 😍 miss you!
Cbi fully sold out. Now, I am sure bcz their working progress feels like jiah khan&#39;s case and soon they will convert case towards drug angle and shut the case off. Bcz big big star and politician behind in this murder.Cbi also corrupted:*******.We are now dividing hoping lose:*((((.It is very tough to give justice to ssr.
All these interviews were not seen when he was alive...it was suppressed...had we seen all this before, his fan following would have surpassed that of Amitabh or SRK...<br>Gutterwood sensed it and hence this pure soul was snuffed out
This man is 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
He is truly a living legend..
Such a great soul, waiting for the justice. They pay bomb to their stylists but what a bad job he has done on his sidelocks.
I have never seen such a good human being in my life. So so sooo intelligent , all- rounder, sincere, broad minded, outspoken still so innocent boy. Really we are so unlucky that we lost him so early. We miss him a lot.
Sushant was very genuine and humble guy.. I had met him twice via a mutual friend.. Never did he ever brag or made a big deal of being a star. Always greeted everyone.. Infact he was just a regular guy like us.. He spoke to all the helpers in the gym and greeted watchmen... I hope he is  at ease and peace.. I will cherish his memories forever ❤️
I&#39;m totally in love with genuine,humble Sushant...No words can explain how much I love him...This never happened to me....Sushant you stole so many hearts❤One of them is me
Trained in martial art for 3yrs(he was fast learner too, his strength, technique, intelligence would have made by him Super Defender too) that&#39;s why the criminals made him unconscious before doing hedious crime. He would have even defended in the process, if he was fully conscious he would have knock them all out single handedly.
Dark horse indeed
A genius indeed. To see roadside goons, literally evil looking men,   not worthy to even kiss the ground he walks/walked on bullying him pushing him at his own birthday party is shocking.  How did such people enter the life of such a brilliant human being? !! A mystery that should be investigated.
Muhabat mein Nai hai Farq jeene or Marne ka ushi ko dekh Kar jeete hai jis kafir par dam nikle..
Very intelligent Sushant<br>Hamara pyara bachha Sushant missing Pura India<br>Please come back😢😢
Feels very bad for such a sweet and innocent guy... The whole life to whom he was passionate or wanted to meet, also left his superb career SHE took away his life... strange but true...❤️
15.48......Ankita❤ Sushant
Why he left her?
He had personality that&#39;s why ppl fell for him..good looks,intelligence and innocence.
Sushant was so sorted. He knew what he was doing. I wished Ankita n he had moved together. I&#39;m sure somebody had tried very hard to separate them  to fulfil the plan of ruining him.
Brilliant, fantastic and very honest interview by Sushant👏👏👏👏👏
Hi Sush, one of your best interviews I ever listened as interesting and found as ever time favourite🤗
When I was seeing this video I was in tears .We want justice for Sushant Singh Rajput. You will remain in our heart forever SSR ❤❤😘😘
We have lost him before knowing him at all!
Y y y did they break up ?? He talks so passionately about her ??  What happened??
....VISCERA is not likely to reveal anything because his relatives might have refused to give DNA sample; thereupon DNA analysis of the viscera alone might have shown that it belongs to MAHA and not BHR proving the suspicion that an “abandoned body” was cremated hurriedly without any respect!<br><br>....ENGAGEMENT is simply a drama, which was being postponed again and again for more than a year; MRKH cannot be acceptable to everyone for so many reasons! Nevertheless, support is continued to be provided!<br><br>....DESCRIPTION of the “dead body” over pinkish cloth and the pinkish cloth woven over white cloth to represent placenta and umbilical cord respectively - this whole body picture was released in the beginning by HindiRush - Hindi division of Pink Villa<br><br><br>....RELATIVES of the TWIN deaths deny murder angle right from the beginning because they know “Organic Farming” of the TWINS to the MRKH is the truth, which if revealed would be challenged legally or socially, though humanely done after a gap of four years; probably, the in vitro and surrogacy was tried with “dusri aurat” but failed due to age or other factors!<br><br><br>....TWIN deaths and TWIN kids stories are TWINNED, which the CBI is insidiously trying to solve correctly to prove their dignified existence as a national most respected organisation; for this CBI will have to play as “Sherlock Holmes” instead of mechanically investigating and not applying Extra Sensory Perception (ESP) to conclude perfectly because CBI has been put to TEST by the Mumbai CID and NaMo government to prove their excellence!<br><br>....THREE months, still keeping the public excited with “injection” of new videos, diary pages, witness etc; actually, his PR team is working creatively behind the scene to “inject” from those EIGHT HARD DISCs, such that he can be launched as the “first sibling” sometime next year from a higher pedestal like NASA or Hollywood or somewhere but with new appearance, new name, new accent etc; so that public will have a deja vu experience but cannot prove legally!<br><br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CEwVaiDhjDl/?igshid=xv4jkjw44kog">https://www.instagram.com/tv/CEwVaiDhjDl/?igshid=xv4jkjw44kog</a><br><br>....LAST call to previous Ex by the Ex-manager reveals surrogacy connection; needed to be protected in the fresh environment of the farmhouse, where eatables for two months were bought! Twins and to maintain as normal, Caesarean in the first week of Aug; he did want to confide into recent live in partner by drawing a TRIANGLE and by showing a book titled “LOADED”!<br><br><br>....CBI is likely to conclude SUICIDE because Mumbai CID might have confided their ESCAPE DRAMA, which was enacted to protect his dignity and provide support for rehabilitation from drug withdrawal symptoms at HOUSTON according to the 2017 Act to offer governmental support to those who are suicide or threat prone!<br><br>....in order to avoid post escape drama confusion and consequences, CBI will declared it as SUICIDE to be consistent with the CID! CBI came in reluctantly on the advice of the Supreme Court to gain public confidence in the Justice System; probably, it was not realised initially that it will run for this long with this loud outcry of the public! For having immortalised Dhoni and being an intellectual young man, CID, NaMo and others might have agreed to protect and support maintaining his dignity!<br><br>....POLICE made “Accidental Death Report”, likely to get insurance!<br><br>....Dil Bechara did huge business on OTT (over the top) - fast internet - Disney-Hotstar, earning about 2,000 crores, might get huge share from that as the lead actor!<br><br>....changed name, changed look as “first sibling”, brothers can look alike, accent will also change!<br><br>....surrogate mother similarly protected through “Made Up News” and “SHAM postmortem”!<br><br>....might be next year after all the cases settle down!<br><br><br><br> ....SWOLLEN face and ligature mark painting got washed off when the body was washed at the mortuary (abandoned body); even his relatives and one of his most blamed best friends, pretended to have seen face only just before cremation. Quite strange that relatives and friends would not try to see face at home or hospital!<br><br><br>....SYSTEMATIC dismantling initiated by the Genius after early 2019, left the big flat after a religious ritual, packed up or sold decorative and household items, moved to simpler flat and went on Europe tour; there, after seeing the painting of a man eating his own newborn child, got reminded to go back to previous live in partner for in vitro and surrogacy; TWINS!<br><br><br>....MEDICINES mentioned in FIR by the recent live in partner, are just for sleeplessness; do not hint towards Bipolar or Depression! Anxiety might be due to Cabal infested Bollywood, which for an example abusively deprived the role in biopic of George Fernandes etc!<br><br><br>....ORGANISED crimes by, of and for the Aboriginals of the Economic Capital of India....must be fettered before their hands again on someone’s blood or again doing terrorism and barbarism! Thanks! Aj Facebook: Ajay Simon Richard<br><br><br>....ARTFULLY woven with pink cloth over white central portion to represent umbilical cord and rest of the pink cloth representing the placenta because the idea is about “rebirth” into a different country as “alien” and keeping the arms in flying posture because upon repeated appeal since the beginning of June, his live in partner posted on the 6th itself, “unlock, unwind, untie ....can fly”!<br><br>....ESCAPE was required to start a new life at NASA after the rehabilitation at Houston - helped by DIG brother-in-law, Mumbai CID, loyal staff at home, creative flatmate and two of his best friends!<br><br>....SINCE 2017, suicide attempt has been decriminalised and government has promised to support suicide and threat prone citizens!<br><br><br>....MAY 26th, just about three weeks before the “Escape”, called one of his two best friends, who chose to stay downstairs and subsequently, taken to nearly hundred kilometres away to the farm house, where “organic farming” of “TWINS” was going on through surrogacy (Ex-manager) for previous Ex (MRKH)!<br><br>....INDEED, withdrawal symptoms needed rehabilitation at Houston but to “burn the ships” dramatised “suicide” with the help of loyal staff, creative flatmate, DIG brother-in-law and Mumbai CID under the 2017 Act, which is meant to support with dignity, the suicide and threat prone citizens!<br><br>....PAVITRA Rista, which had started on 1st June 2009, has been restarted on the request of his previous Ex, which was shown till around 2014; this time it will be extended with the acts of the “First Sibling” and the “Twins”!<br><br>....FIRST sibling “LOST” at the age of one and a half; “lost” is the word, not “died”!<br><br>....once the “suicide or murder” drama ends, he will be presented to public as the “first sibling” found!<br><br>....the “first sibling” will instantly fall in love with the previous long term Ex with the twins already through in-vitro surrogacy (Ex Manager)!<br><br>....of course, he will be presented to public in changed name and may be changed religion too!<br><br>....the creative artist flatmate is brilliantly cooperating with the genius to display his biopic live, in which he himself is acting for himself for the public for the two and a half months defeating any other news from taking the first position in trending having already made 2,000 crores  from Dil Bechara on OTT (over the top - fast internet - advertisers pay)!<br><br>....under 2017 act, this escape enactment has been enabled by Mumbai CID for rehabilitation from suicidal tendencies in Houston; the CBI is being tested in the process; might take help of Interpol!<br><br><br>....BIOPIC is running live for two and a half months with the genius himself acting as himself; and no other news is able to take first position in the trending!<br><br>Biopic plan by him:<br><a href="https://twitter.com/iFaridoon/status/1300284378812096517">https://twitter.com/iFaridoon/status/1300284378812096517</a><br><br>....”FACE” of one of his best friends, is being kept hidden in all interviews, only voice message or media posts of memoirs being displayed because the members of the CID team (except the chief, who knew the drama), ambulance staff, hospital staff, might recognise and reveal that he pretended as the “dead body”!<br><br>....QUITE strange that the body was not accompanied by his sister or his best friend to the hospital; they were staying at the house and  they went to the hospital only when called for Aadhar Card copy; moreover, body was not received from the hospital by any one of his relatives!<br><br>Best friend’s clarifications:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9mhquwuWRc">https://youtu.be/s9mhquwuWRc</a><br><br><br>....LIGHTS were put off early on the day before, such that everyone goes to sleep early and wakes up by 1-2 am for preparing for the flight to Houston on the CID recommendation for mental health rehabilitation under the 2017 law, which offers to support with dignity to suicide or threat prone people! <br><br><br>....”Byomkesh Baksy”, detective film (2015) was not watched much but the genius learnt quite a lot about “Sherlock Holmes tricks” and “Sonchiriya” (March 2019) about “Chambal Dacoits” ran into huge loss! Nevertheless, he applied “engineering cognitive tools” to earn huge share out of the  2,000 crores business of Dil Bechara, which prompted his father to sideline the live in partner before she puts her hands on money because she can claim as a wife can according to 2003 law; and she says that she will fight!<br><br>....”As per the Act, the government will have the duty to provide care, treatment and rehabilitation to the person, who attempts suicide and has severe stress, to reduce the risk of recurrence of attempt to commit suicide.”<br><br>Government Decriminalises Suicide, Notifies New Law:<br><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-decriminalises-suicide-notifies-new-law-1861575?amp=1&amp;akamai-rum=off">https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-decriminalises-suicide-notifies-new-law-1861575?amp=1&amp;akamai-rum=off</a><br><br>....BOOK was ready to be published - “How To Have A Solution”!
He loves Ankita so much so honest...
Wants to listen him more nd more.
Such an innocent soul.... didn&#39;t his murderers hands shiver before murdering him
Why on earth his destiny to be like that. Really truely lose a real man. You are such a real gifted man in a million. Why people can&#39;t get his extraordinary in him while he is alive?? I wonder
See...He told that &quot;I really want to pee and have a smoke&quot; Yes he is a smoker.. but not even a chain smoker..<br>sirf smoking tha yaar yeh saali ne rhea ne sirf us cheez ko le kar.. Hamari SSR ko badnaam karahai hye... saali...
LOve SSR .. he was super awesome.. Gosh.. its just so so so so beyond basic human traits.. he is a super super super biggest store of all talent and intelligence.. we will hardly see such culmination of creativity , hot lovely handsome looks along with intelligence of his levels, and so much real attitude..
Sushant read it and knew that: They ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight with you, and then you Win....So simple.....But what happened with him makes it more: They ignore you, then they insult you, then they laugh at you, then they isolate you, then they defame you, then they fight with you, then they trap you, They make you weak (mentally, physically as well as financially) and if a Gem like person SSR, comes out clean from all defame and recover from all these traps, then they kill you.....But they still fail and Sushant you still Win, because, now you have your Fans, fighting for you. No matter If OTT platform or even TV shows get flooded with big celebrities movies &amp; programs, the Charm from the entertainment media has been lost !!!
Miss u jaggu
his thoughts about girls brought his dooms day.<br>He wanted to deal with many hot girls and not being only one woman man.
So, the video has been uploaded in november 2015, yet most of the comments are from 2 months to a week old, and somehow everyone was SSR biggest fan since the beginning... Funny how that works!
He said he knew First ppl will  IGNORE ; then LAUGH at you ; then FIGHT with u And then The quote says You WIN . But then in that fight they used LOVE game to KILL him to not let him Win ... cause his victory would have been HUGE .... HUGER than them so they Killed him . And I wish he would have remained with Ankita , it’s so clear ki ye sirf usi ke liye MOHABBAT word use kiya hai ab takk , Baaki baad mein to ye hot girls romance excitement ka Sapna poora karne mein behek gya
Justice for Sushant Singh rajput <br>We all Miss you.. 😭😭😭😭
Sush❤❤❤❤
Pure soul❤, RIP
Sparks in his eyes is something magic❤️
So intelligent,polite and most honest. Just can&#39;t be a drug addict. He was put to it by his enemies and ultimately murdered. Trust must come out and culprits must be punished. He certainly should get justice.
Breathtaking Sushant ! . No one came like him !. The good loving nature that is overwhelming ! . &amp; he steals the show so naturally &amp; effortlessly .Which of course provoked all the distorted minds out there . Sushant is in our hearts cherished &amp; adored till end of time . A true genuine being of light .The one &amp; only Sushant Singh Rajput. 🕊🙏💔
JUSTICE FOR SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT NOW - WORLD IS WATCHING -
I’m glad he didn’t go on koffee with Karan — karan couldn’t handle his intelligence
He was calm and genuinely happy with Ankita — he left the right girl and got killed with the wrong one. Justice for Sushant -
SSR was so bright... the sad part is the paid PR machinery commenting here as well..... Shame on them....These bollywood hypocrites are shameless
Soo cute much ❤❤💋Sushant singh rajput is handsome 👌👌<br>💋💋💞💞💞💞🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍💞💞😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😊👍👍👍😘😘😘😘😘😘<br>We will be miss you Sushant singh rajput <br>R.I.P 💐💐💐💐💐💔💔<br>💐💐💐💐💐💐😩😩😩😩😩😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😔😔🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Gem of a Guy !
Miss u sush everyday
15 :25 actors deny or hide relationship, but you are unique in expressing your relationship... making it public?? <br>He just wanted stability, a happy family life, but these monsters cooked up stories and made their relationship vulnerable and finally killing it
Philosophical as you may become ...<br>You may teach your children this philosophy.<br><br>Identify yourself with something, some kind of work you can or should do it rest of your life,<br>Have courage to back it,<br>Be extremely, extremely EXCITED ABOUT it, about doing it.
Sushant I love you for who you were, for who you had been.
First they will ignore you.<br>Then they will laugh at you.<br>Then they will fight with you.<br>And then they will kill you, murder you, butcher you in heinous way.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4sushant">#JUSTICE4SUSHANT</a> SINGH RAJPUT<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4dishasalian">#JUSTICE4DISHASALIAN</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4steve">#JUSTICE4STEVE</a> PINTO<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4common">#JUSTICE4COMMON</a> MAN<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23punish">#PUNISH</a> MEDIAHOUSES LIKE DNA, MUMBAI MIRROR, BOLLYWOOD LIFE WHO WROTE BLINDS AGAINST <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ourssushant">#OURSSUSHANT</a>.

His problems in life started in 2016 after March when he willingly broke up with ankita for his bollywood career,  and at the end of  that year he had that dark party where had spat with salman panchouli. And the outcome is 2020 June 13-14 😢
Best interview of Sushant all those I have heard so far👍❤️
😥
Such a talented soul..We miss u Sushi♥️
He was such a breath of fresh air.. Very untypical
He looked so healthier n wholesome compared to his last videos with u know who
So no disrespect to sushant singh but @21 he clearly points out he has Insomania can&#39;t sleep more than 2 hours a day, and second is the Important one he clearly say&#39;she is Claustrophobic. <br>Those who release Sushant&#39;s flying video and troll Rhea kindly use this logic <br>If one is afraid of water he would try to learn to Swim so that fear of drowning ends. Apply the same logic here Sushant was claustrophobic and thus wanted to learn to fly.  You Dumb bhakts get to your senses.
Oh god.. He is so much cuter than a baby.. 😍
Love u &amp; miss u Sushant

When this interview happened
What a IQ chancless <br>We miss you a lot
Everything is perfect about sushant but, I don&#39;t think so that he was claustrophobic or insomnia patient.<br>I think that&#39;s a false or edited video.
21: 20 did he said tha he has claustrophobia.
The best interview 🙌
14june pura bollywood maar gaya mere liyep
He himself admitted he is claustrophobic does that mean ankitha does not know sush well?

So he was claustrophobic??? Rest In Peace SSR!!!
He said he is claustrophobic. Watch from @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1272">21:12</a>
Yaar kar leta shaadi ankita se .....
yes we loss him India loss him.
Sushaant Singh Rajpoot was too intelligent for anyone&#39;s liking.... He&#39;s no match to the dumbheaded Bollywood stars and kids.
Kaash ki tum ankita ke saath hote to aaj hume aapko khona nhi padta 😘😭😭😭😭
Medias tentatively hide Sushant from us by deliberately not promoting his interviews....and spread fake rumors against him brutally in accordance to please Bollywood masters......everything needs to be stopped the whole system is rotten...now needs to be cancelled and start from scratch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1280">21:20</a> He Himself Admits That He Is Claustrophobic &amp; Insomniac 🙏🏻
Kuch toh baat rahi hogi jo kjo ne kabhi Sushant ko Coffee with karan par invite nhi kia.. He was jealous from Sushant right from the beginning 😡
He is not anxious in this ,.. over the period of time if we see his interviews with loads of hand n feet movements . Probably some face reactions were also bit different in later years than those times (4years back).<br>everything developed over the period of time- worries especially!
really an honest man
Omg😳😳😳😳 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1290">21:30</a> sushant confess he is claustrophobic
People wasted time on ranveer Singh, varun dhawan. Now they realizing. But its not people mistake. Its media to be blamed. Media never revealed SSR good side at all
Byomkesh bakshi👍👍👍 was really good movie. ...cast + story👍👍👍
Waterstone😠😠😠
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1443">24:03</a> 💔 that smile :)
If each one of us introspect ourselves, then v know v r also claustrophobic....every one will have fear for something either it would be height, closed n confined rooms , anything it would be.... but we closely watch SSR case it is not about depression r mental disorder r insomniac....things happened n happening r closely related to murder.....CBI has to investigate without  any interruptions from political parties.....jus becoz of one point he said in his interview that he is claustrophobic n insomniac v  cannot come to conclusion he could have committed suicide.... definitely something is fishy....whether it  is rhea r somebody else......truth should come out very soon....
He admits to being claustrophobic in this interview.
I can&#39;t take eyes from him. How cute he was ❤️❤️
Claustrophobia means getting scared of crowded places or feeling or feeling suffocated in windowless room or in elevator. It&#39;s very common to have claustrophobia, people can easily overcome this. We also sometimes can feel suffocated in such kind of places generally. The name is scary only. This doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s leaning towards depression. It&#39;s very common to have claustrophobia. It&#39;s not big issue. When rhea said he was claustrophobiac she said he used to scare of heights and plane which is totally wrong. Because claustrophobia doesn&#39;t do anything with flight or heights. She was lying. She also don&#39;t know about these things. She was giving wrong medicines or drugs to him. she got caught .her lawyer and PR team should have tell her meaning of claustrophobia 😂😂
This man is so intelligent and so positive about his life. His morals and way of thinking I have never seen in any of other Bollywood actors truly. He gave life lessons to everyone 24.37 to 25.40. You will be terriblly missed Sush😢😩😭😭😭😭RIP legend 🙏🙌🙌🙌There won&#39;t be another sushant we will get now😢😭😭😭
Omg I miss his presence
A guy becomes ENGINEER in the FIRST year itself, he learns life, then it is up to him how he takes his life ahead in his &quot;engineering ways&quot;<br><br>Proud to be an engineer myself, my GF (back in 2011) couldn&#39;t marry me because of castism (when you talk about nepotism) - she married someone born brahman not earned brahman :)<br><br>P.S. - Now happy in Norway, this December in snow, around Christmas,  will get married to my present GF from Russia, she is the kindest soul I ever met - I AM GLAD I DID NOT KILL MYSELF MY HEART WAS SOOO MENTALLY BROKE BACK THEN, fuck you castists and nepotists
He said that he was claustrophobic himself. Rhea said the same thing. Ankita said the opposite of this. She said posting a video of sushant flying a plane that &quot;is this claustrophobic??&quot; What does all this mean?  It can happen that rhea had previously seen the video and then was acting like she was revealing the fact for the 1st time. Or it can also be true that Rhea has been  put up wrongly in all this incident. Whatever be the case, but one thing is for sure that there is something seriously very wrong in ths case
He is so intelligent... My god super talented... This bolly biggies didn&#39;t deserved him.. but y u killed him... Oh god... Y u killed him..
What to say... Miss you SSR. We all love you. You are already a winner. Stay happy in the other world.
I feel like Ankita is making Sushant&#39;s case her war zone. Why did she slap Rhea&#39;s claim of him being claustrophobic!? No one expects her to comment on his case. So dud Rhea actually know him better than Ankita. Cause he even said this while dating Ankita. Ankita must just take a seat now and stop buffing statements with old videos cause the Sushant&#39;s she last spoke to 4/5yrs ago is DIFFERENT from the Sushant in 2020. People don&#39;t even need 4/5 yrs to change. You actually just need months.
This interview is four years old but even if he admitted he was claustrophobic he might have been interested in fighting his fears. He would be more interested in enlarging his interests and overcoming his fears. So he wasn&#39;t claustrophobic anymore. Can&#39;t believe Rheas statements to be true.
He was claustrophobic nd suffering from insomnia 😔😔
You have the opposite quality in this bollywood being extremely honest which most of the stars are not..
May his soul rest in peace ...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnENclMQ5OE">https://youtu.be/UnENclMQ5OE</a> kya sochte the susant
Coming straight from himself...omg..did Rhea saw this interview and use it for her wicked interview.??
So he was claustrophobic. Rhea was not lying.
Love you Sushant... u will be Missed forever 💔😭😭😭
Did He admitted Claustrophobia in this interview ??
He is the most Sweetest , most Wisest human ever! God Bless You Sir. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23youradmirer">#Youradmirer</a>
Extremely intellectual.
He was so very passionate about acting. Not much actors can say that most just do it because they got the opportunity and it&#39;s good money
He shouldn&#39;t have died, bahut galat hua bhagwan
Much better show than the crap Koffee. Sushant is frank, forthright and has thought clarity. Sad that he is no more. Tragic. Genuine superstar. Made it on his own. Rest in peace Sushant. You were a gift to all film lovers. Wish you could have gone on and on
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1285">21:25</a> he himself claims that he is claustrophobic. May the real culprit get behind bars 🙏
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1285">21:25</a> claustrophobic
Why why would they break up ..so sad ..
Why is rhea being bashed after she said ssr was claustrophobic?
Sushant I just don&#39;t want to believe that you are no more.
Quite informative.

As GB Shaw said - &quot;There are two tragedies in life: one is to lose your heart&#39;s desire, the other is to gain it. &quot;
Really genious sir.❤️
Ok, so he said he is claustrophobic and &quot;someone&quot; had to drug him to cure him (sic) and being claustrophobic leads to serious mental health.. WOW !!
The fear of flying, known as aerophobia, is a type of anxiety disorder involving the extreme sense of fear and panic.<br>Also, CLAUSTROPHOBIA means extremely afraid of small, enclosed spaces.
he is clusterfobic, i mean is rhea right?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1290">21:30</a> he says he IS claustrophobic ....proving how dumb memers and crazy ppl have gone...hatred is so sick that it can actually break all important investigation and directions just bcoz of pressure
Oh shit he&#39;s saying he is claustrophobic 😦
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1260">21:00</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1288">21:28</a> he says he is claustrophobic
I want justice for Sushant but please see his statement from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1272">21:12</a>
Reha was right, he was claustrophobic
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1445">24:05</a> 😭😭 Miss You Sush ❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1260">21:00</a><br>Claustrophobia is a situational phobia triggered by an irrational and intense fear of tight or crowded spaces. It can be triggered by things like being locked in a windowless room, being stuck in a crowded elevator, or driving on a congested highway. Claustrophobia is one of the most common phobias.

Sushant please come back😖 <br>We wish if you have never met Rhea in ur life and u never left Ankita. That was ur biggest mistake..😣 we will miss u forever.. <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice">#Justice</a> for sushant <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23arrest">#arrest</a> rhea
Sad to say that<br>India ne anmol ratan kho diya<br>Woh hamare dilo me hamesta zindha h aur rahenge<br>Ane wali generation ki generations tak Sushant ki life ke baare me bataya gayega aur usse hum zindha rakhenge
But clautrophobia doesn&#39;t means fear from heights aur uske liye modafinil nhi liya jaata... Of course rhea thoda taiyari se gai hogi interview dene to sushant ke interviews bhi dekhe honge aur kaise bhi khichdi story bana ke pesh kar diya hoga.. Taki logo ko inn choti choti points se lagne lage ki rhea jo keh rhi thi sach hai!!
HE IS LIKE SHAKESPEARE, WHO IS REMEMBERED AND BECAME MASSIVELY FAMOUS AFTER DEATH, YOU ARE IN EVERYONE&#39;S HEART MY PURE SOUL SUSHANT ❤️ ❤️
I still can&#39;t believe that he&#39;s no more with us
Sushant was indeed claustrophobic , so Rhea was not lying about his condition , nevertheless its disheartening to know that he never received the admiration and love he needed when he was alive.
In this interview he is looking very calm and happy but when I go through to some of his recent interviews I can find he was restless and like some thing was bothering him.
Having claustrophobia does not justify that he committed suicide at all, He was murdered , Justice for SSR
He also said that he had insomnia..he cant sleep for more then 2 hrs ..then how come it possible that he sleeps whole day nd that bitch was partying ...it clearly shows that rhea was giving him drugs.
This is a game where he &#39;LIES&#39; that he is Claustrophia. He is NOT claustrophia. Certain people supporting that stupid lady Rhea when she told in India Today that he Claustrophobia. Such a big LIAR she n taking advantage of this video. This is actually a SLAP to Rhea n her supporters. Keep ur EARS wide open n watch this video carefully
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1288">21:28</a> - Rhea was saying the truth after all. Ankita lokhande is exposed now. Time for CBI to grill ankita now. Ankita&#39;s behaviour after his death always seemed to be suspicious. Hope sushant gets his due justice.
What&#39;s wrong with the people having fingers ,smart phone ,unlimited data and that&#39;s it what ever coming in to mind they will start type stop bashing others either ankitha or rhea people always having two faces...may be ankitha doesn&#39;t know that he is claustrophobic as he never admitted to her and he might be told to rhea...you people will talk rubbish and later shows sympathy stay calm and wait until truth revealed otherwise u people will feel ashame of Ur self on one day
Last me sushant Mana Kar raha tha ki ye record mat karna wo kya tha??? He doing some action but i can&#39;t understand
So he did have claustrophobia. RIP. Hope the filthy vultures trying to gain clout from his death like Ankita lundkhande and Kangana Run-out go to hell
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1289">21:29</a>
rhea was right in her interview it proves her points were valid🙏
If SSR had insomnia then why was he sleeping all day as his cook reported?
You guys never know if Rhea has seen this interview first before doing her PR. Whatever the case may be, she has been repeatedly defaming the late actor by claiming he did drugs, or that his sisters aren&#39;t good and that his mother was depressed. <br><br>ONE TRUTH CANNOT HIDE THE MANY LIES SHE HAS SPOKEN FROM THE BEGINNING.<br><br>In her entire PR she is not bothered for finding SSR culprits and rather insists on saving her own tarnished image. It reflects how truly and deeply she loved SSR
I miss u... 💔
How many here after Google&#39;s recommendation for this VDO?
Ab kaha gaye republic bharat wale yeh bhi fix interview hai kya 😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1289">21:29</a> the part where he admits that he&#39;s claustophobic. (Just the starting of the question, eventually you&#39;ll realise he&#39;s saying that he is)
Ek sawal ye bhi khada hota hai ki sushant ko marke rhea ko kya milega 🤔🤔
No need to believe whatever Ankita claims or says . She knew very little of him but pretends as if her approval about him is the last saying.
If y&#39;all came here to hear that he claustrophobic, the game starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1275">21:15</a>
Watch the way he&#39;s speaking,the words,the body language,the confidence,the emotions,the honesty,how can such a person be in depression,eyes full of dreams, <br>want justice for Sushant
We ll always love and respect you,where are u ,pls come back
A person of his words 💙💙💙
God knows what to believe.. Here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1280">21:20</a>  he says <br>1. That he is claustrophobic, 2. The he sleeps for six hours every day, and 3. That he was a terrible singer. He then revealed that the second fact was a lie. He said that he was an insomniac and could only sleep for two hours everyday.<br><br>Par isne plane udaai.. Aur ankita bhi post ki, ki ise claustrophobia ni tha. To sach kya hai???? Mahadev help kro.. Plz sach batao..
He was claustrophobic
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1300">21:40</a> did He just admit to being claustrophobic and an insomniac?
He says in this he has insomnia and claustrophobia...... very confusing
We loose the most intellectual personality of Bollywood. A wholesom person 😔
Ankitna you not innocent so sad shushant openly expresses his love for you.but you ditched him...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1285">21:25</a> he Admit that he had claustrophobia
No comparison
He is saying that he was clostrophobic and was having insomnia problem.Insomnia leads to depression also.Rhea said in Aaj tak interview that he was <a href="http://clostrophobic.it/">clostrophobic.It</a> means that she is right.Ankita lokhanda claiming that he wasn&#39;t clostrophic.I am wondering why she is telling lie.???🙄🙄🙄🙄Sab jhol hai 🙏Kuch samajh nhi aa rha

SSR IS NOT A COMMON MAN A GOOD GENIUS  HIS QUALITIES ARE GIFTED BY GOD # warriors for SSR
Rhea thik hai phale blame kr rhai hai uska interview bhi acha tha at least apna pksh to rha brna to hum Indian ek tarf  ka sunkr ldki ko galiya dene ka kaam krte h ye pura nhi sunna ek tarf ka gyan fela dete hai
He is claustrophobic
Ankita  claims he was never claustrophobic despite being in live in relationship for over 6 yrs. This proves that she was a bad gf who didnt know a shit about her bf
He quite hinted at having two minds , but somehow over the years this grew on him .... Only he knew the truth and that has been taken to ashes now
its quite clear she didnt know him at all .rhea was telling the truth.its so sad to see rhea being made a  scapegoat in this. i wish republic channel gets  banned and arnab goswami gets barred from broadcasting news for life . they have made a mockery of journalism and its even more disgusting to see most of the people fall for it without any evidence
Ankita said sushant was never claustrophobic, and at the time of this interview he was with her. Is she lying or she never REALLY knew SSR.
Guys.. Rhea may have been right here but given she was dating Sushant for so long and had so much intervention in his life its ofcourse obvious she would know about him..but how does that justify other inconsistencies and lies? Indian people are so gullible I swear to God.. Sushant’s doctor denies prescribing the medicine for claustrophobia Rhea talked about.. and she has also lied about several other things.. please don’t declare her innocent because she was right about a thing or two.. she will use all of Sushant’s weaknesses to prove her side of the story..
So it looks like Rhea was right and Ankita really seems like the lying/ignorant girlfriend. Let the media  mob lynching continue.

I love sushi
So normal so much love for the family not a hint of depression  he was suffering from rheagresstion a very bad disease it will kill you Ppl beware of it
All that riya said is true about him<br>He is claustrophobic <br>He has insomnia <br>He really miss his mother <br>Sad to see him die so young.  .. 😖
Wht u wanna say... Rea is right... Shame on u... N ur channel...
So SSR admits he is claustrophobic and insomniac , Rhea was not lying then.
And I noticed this is the same waterstone resort in Mumbai
How his way of talking, so sweet... Intelligent man.
Dear sushant ❤, The interview you gave is so inspiring I have ever listenened ❤
He does mentions being claustrophobic. Guess rhea knew him better than Ankita .
Who else here to check <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23claustrophobic">#claustrophobic</a> talk??hey people,  just try to know what is the meaning of claustrophobia.....he never meant that he was afraid of heights...it&#39;s a fear of tight and crowd spaces ..PLEASE DON&#39;T MISUNDERSTAND <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushant">#justiceforsushant</a>
Sushant is soo honest. ..about everything. He speaks his heart out. I love him even more now. I soo wish I could have a chat or interview with him and tell him all things sooo Good and relatable about him. He is the Best.
Is Rhea Chakraborty dayan ne itne intelligent..down to earth Insaan Ko mar diya
Now where are all those people who are saying that rhea is lying??
For those who are here for claustrophobic comment made by SSR , this is for ppl who are praising Rhea as they are paid to do so , ( you cant stop the justice from taking place !)<br>please understand being a Claustrophobic dose not mean a man i depressed and does not want to live , basically it means person has a fear of being in confined places, and most of us are like that but we just dont realize it !
That means he was actually claustrophobic.
Can believe yet can&#39;t believe he did that to him. Believe because he has made the most unpredictable decisions in life. Don&#39;t believe coz he very intelligent &amp;  sane mind!!
Sadly, the kind of scrutiny given to Rhea Chakraborty is not given to Sushant&#39;s family or Ankita&#39;s statements. Ankita wants everyone to believe that he left her for someone not worthy. That is her emotion and I respect that. But we, the public, should keep where she is coming from before taking her words as the gospel truth. They must have also had issues for the breakup to happen and it could be an ex jealous of the new girlfriend as well. Then we have the family. Based on the whatsapp chats, it is clear Sushant apologised to Rhea for his sister molesting her. The family wants us to believe Rhea had lied and poisoned his mind against them. That is hard for me to believe. My brother will never trust another woman&#39;s word against me in a matter like this because our relationship is that strong. Were Sushant&#39;s family that close to him as they pretend to be? He died after his sister was given the responsibility of taking care of him. If I had got my brother all to myself after his awful girlfriend had left him, I would have taken care of him more. It looks like Rhea was the one who took care of him for the last year. The family was nowhere in the picture. They now want us to believe Rhea drugged him, controlled him, brainwashed him etc and that is why they didn&#39;t meet often. It seems a bit difficult for me to believe that Sushant was such a fool. Look at his response when he and Sara are asked whose family contacts them the most. When Sara says it&#39;s hers, he says &#39;thank god.&#39; If he was that close with his family, he would have never said that. This was before he met Rhea, so Rhea brainwashing him is no excuse here.
For which reason ( claustrophobic) you are hear is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1273">21:13</a> ..thank me later
He mentioned he was claustrophobic at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1271">21:11</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1289">21:29</a>
so rhea said true...and ankita know nothing...
Mafia of maharashtra was jealous and murdered son of india
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1170">19:30</a>... The way he took out that tshirt for his fan... Tht smile on his face show tht how happy he is while gifting his things to others😭😭😭😭😭<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23deep">#deep</a>
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1271">21:11</a> he says he&#39;s claustrophobic
His works spoke louder than his words.....he was talented ....<br>It hurts to think that he is no more even to type that he was .....my heart weeps at his loss...
claustrophobic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1280">21:20</a> !!! ankita is a liar
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=956">15:56</a>... Kaash yhi rehta or yahi hota 😢...fame km hota pr tum hote...  ❤️itni success nhi hoti pr tum us mukaam mein pohoch jaate der se hi sahi..❤️ # woh lamha hi sahi nhi tha jb tum Ankita se door hue
okay so whoever is coming here .........Do watch full interview about sushant&#39;s dream........just dont only watch one part
such a difference between this and the later interviews. He sounds healthy and happy. Some interviews in 2019(, with Manoj / masand), he sounds completely out of sorts.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1290">21:30</a> where sushant says he is claustrophobic
Don&#39;t you think rhea haven&#39;t watched this interview ok leave that she also told he was taking  modafinil to avoid this go and google,this medicine is for excessive sleepiness Daytime or for sleep disorder
So now some media is Doing really well prepared PR stunt....writing articles about that he was claustrophobic and giving link of this interview....and some really dumb people easily accept that...why can&#39;t you see that they are playing with your minds..they are trying to change narrative of this whole case..how they are trying to play game with your mind...and making you doubt about your decision to support this case....You Damn Media shit and PR shit....you really know your job.....Now its upto people that they really will manipulated by this PR stunt.Or not...let&#39;s watch....👉👈
He confessed that he was claustrophobic.. Nd insomniac... But still he was good in acting skills which could have given him new heights
Rhea well prepared for the interview to escape from SSR murder. What is the point to discuss about clasteophobic? She catched some points from this interview and trying to manipulate who are fighting for SSR. Well trained from maha government.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1285">21:25</a>  to he himself says he is clasteophobic .may god bless him
Such a real person he was  !!! We have lost a very talented and genuine person.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1290">21:30</a> - he admitted he is a claustrophobic 😬😬
Mention of his claustrophobia - 29.15

Breaking News : Sushant was revealed in an earlier interview that he is Claustrophobic.! <br><br>Now who is lying?!!!  Rhea or Ankita /SSR family...?
Ab toh bhai ne khud hi kabool kr diya ki bhai claustrophobic tha...
SO HE WAS INDEED CLAUSTROPHOBIC!!
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH HE IS CLAUSTROPHOBIC. HE HIMSELF SAID THAT
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1288">21:28</a>
And today this channel is using this interview to prove that he was “claustrophobic” So sad how they sell their souls
So he was claustrophobic @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1290">21:30</a> .  So rhea said true here. Then why Ankita who was in 7 year relationship with sushant doesn&#39;t know this fact. Or is she misleading?
Ab mujhe thoda thoda lag raha hai ki rhea sach bol rahi hai
Rhea was right  ✔️
Who else is here after Rhea said Sushant is claustrophobic
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=450">7:30</a> he talked about reinforcement learning (one type of ML learning) in such a simple manner..❤️❤️.. I am getting obsessed with him. 😭😭.. was watching a movie today and was picturing him instead of the hero.
Is this the same resort where CBI is investigating ..?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1272">21:12</a> omg Rhea was right
Supreb interview....miss u intelligent ssr
This host is nice. Sushant ne har interview me yahi sb bola hai. Phr bhi itne faltu k rumours hai
I am Claustrophobic  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1280">21:20</a> ⁉️❓❔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=1280">21:20</a> almost we can see that he is saying truth about him that he is claustrophobic.. And Ankita is saying that he was not.. May be Rhea was saying everything wrong but in this point she is right. And also he is saying that he is insomniac. Ankita was saying in one of her interviews that sushant can&#39;t be depressed he was a real hero but she should know this that hero can also be depressed and a depressed person can also be a hero. A person can get depress at any point of time in his life it is just a disease.
Throughout the interview I was only smiling due to SSR 💖beautiful smile and sparkling eyes. Ankita was the only with SSR could live his life in most beautiful way. We luv you SSR 💞 you always remain alive in our Heart 🦄
Well Sushant Was Claustrophobic Check At 21.17 Rhea is Right This Time
This is what i call class
Justice for ssr 🙏
Can&#39;t listen to him anymore.. my heart breaks into pieces.. I need to somehow get to something else.. its getting worse..
I seriously love Sushant, because he’s so adorable, humble, mostly talented and handsome. He’s so special in everything. Sushant is a huge asset to the world. 🙏👍😘
I did not see like this interview with other bollywood actorses.because he is very famous actor.meny meny people&#39;s are jelous.
I wonder why did he leave her when he has so so much love for her.. fate!
Such a hugh loss...
Very optimistic guy...theres no way he cudve committed suicide!
Mannn where did you go.
Wow this should be shared with Ankita ....he still love her at this interview he spoke so openly then why they broke up
All his words are just full of intelligence and quite different....... This should not be his end.... We miss u
So much I can connct with him...the way he thinks

So down to earth.... He was with zero attitude 😭😭😭😭 not like that other bastard actors and murderer...😠😠 Even not support him after death....this show that how cruel they all r...and how happy they all r after his death.😠😠😠😠 They all r full of shit 💩💩 and bastard..🤬🤬
In this interview, Sushant is Very cute and handsome.
I loved this interview very much compare to other interviews. I felt like... sushant is sitting in front of me... Day by day my love is increasing.. But very sad u r no more... Miss u badly.... Want Justice for Sushant. Love from Tamil Nadu.
Very intelligent, beautiful explanation, very interesting guy
Hi I&#39;m from South.....I like sushant from time of series of pavitra Rishta.....I like him very honestly.... yeah I can same attitude people in South, many who are leaving there dream and very down earth by nature even they are directing movies as well as acting and got good success also....and why not in North I can such people...they feel and make others feel that they are most talented and intelligent people and posh....make other insecure which is not necessary.....sorry if I&#39;m hurting anyone but it is the truth.....*only celebrates*
Will anyone can really believe a man like him lived on earth that too in this era..where all wear a mask(not face mask) ..never honest..Leave people for money and never care about heart connection. This is loss to humanity where beautiful souls are soon leaving and the bad ones are here doing all the nasty things...I wish he had a genuine  friend who had the capability to help him timely and more than ever I wish his soul will find peace and all the scheming ones and murderers will be crashing and ripping apart amd never be remembered...Hope this pure soul gets justice.. <br>He is a beautiful human . Its great to know he lived on earth . I think all got jealous of him .The Gods ..the devil .<br>They couldnt accept someone can be this perfect..The world comprising of mostly cheapstakes vannot match his vibration. Thank God there are some good beings left who spoke for the justice of this soul.. My faith in human kind is little alive..
I just love smart ppl...the more i watch n get to know him...i love him more ...my brother..u will be missed always...it seems like owr loss....
Justice for sushant.
Such a thoughtful person. Amazing sushi

Whenever i see you why i feel like your alive sushant😭😭
Ye 2015 ka interview h or next year sush anki ka breakup ho gya aisa kya reason tha breakup ka
Wonderful human being...RIP SSR
while he was at ease with the success he got, he had multiple ways to apply himself.. in astronomy, AI, Acting, going to NASA, talking to scientists, reading varied books etc etc etc unlike these superficial plastic actors around who know only ramp walk.. free loaders with artificial smile and parasitic survival instinct..
Actually, he never indulged in extreme propaganda about self.. and therefore, we dint create a huha as his fans.. but he was so much more than almost all male actors in Bollywood combined.. be it looks, talent, intelligence, behavior, etiquettes.. he could have given most of them a run for their money had he been not subjected to wrongful neptosim, gangism, criminalism .. he had bounties to achieve with his amazing levels of potential..
OMG....  This man was gem....... Very intelligent...... Look at his T-shirt..... Maxwell equations are written....... this men is die heart lover of physics......... Very very rare combo of good looks, kindness, humbleness, charming smile, intelligence, science freak, dancer and outstanding actor...... Oh God why you take away this super soul......? No one is like you SSR..... That&#39;s why Ankita could never forget you..... You will be missed SSR...........India loves you ......You will always be in our 💕
uff watching him is so painful!!!!
I&#39;ve seen all episodes of this show, one thing I noticed in this one which I personally felt was baised is that in every episode Niranjan gave big hampers to the guests and only in this particular episode of Sushant he just a gave a little card🙄 why so? Why only him? Isn&#39;t it the industry politics and groupism... That&#39;s not fair Niranjan treat everyone equally 💯<br>Sushant spoke his heart out he is a gem that we&#39;ve lost💖
Yes we will fight with you....💕
He is an extraordinary personality...nobody can match his personna n attitude towards Life.<br>I wrote (is) coz he l remain alive in our heart n memories forever n ever...miss him ....💗💗
He has clearly mentioned he used to sleep for not more then 3 hours , that means 3 hour sleep was adequate for him. <br>And now it&#39;s  told that he used to keep sleeping , then who made his sleeping habits change and why ?
Justice for Sushant singh shame on Maharashtra government and mumbai police
We just want CBI investigation.... Modi ji please help us as soon as possible....we  are all begged to you... please... please...
Justice justice for ssr. 💔🕯🌟🌟
Very talented very pure and incredible hero
You had... he has <b>*</b>
He actually puts smile on my face throughout his interview.. so alive..he will continue to stay alive.

This is difference between India and other countries. In India talent don&#39;t have value.I love India but after his demise feel that he would have been in other country as he was intellectual.Western countries give so much value to talent.<br>He talk science and spirituality both.
Soo soo soo nice our supar star❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The more I watch him the more I love him.....I am sorry Sushant I couldn&#39;t love u and support u thus much when u were alive...this is the only regret I may hav ein my life....and I blame media too for this...media did vital role in damaging his image and spreading fake news about him....due to fake news many times he got hurt...media should apologise him and his family...now also his post demise media is showing  about him ....he is the most underrated actor ....not only Bollywood but nation does lost a massive loss..he was very intelligent and pure soul...we lost the most precious human being
definitely his soul is spiritually very much aware of the realities of life....he  can&#39;t end his life
Sushant has the most soothing masculine voice I&#39;ve ever heard
Only if eventually they got married🙏... His life would have been saved😪
Esi ki najar lag gai enke riste ko
I just love him ♥️ Beautiful inside and out. I watched this interview like so many times...I still can&#39;t believe he is gone physically... His death is somewhat personal... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsinghrajput">#justiceforsushantsinghrajput</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23warriors4ssr">#Warriors4SSR</a>
Super interview and conversation..
Now I am crying to watch the interview.  He was honest about his relationship with Ankita.
look who&#39;s talking...wow
His twinkling eyes😍😍
Such an outstanding personality! His intelligence and how he explains things leave me speechless.. The world has lost such a precious gem. 😢
See , how charming n glowing there is energy light...b4 that witch entering into his life... hope you all agree with me

Very Unselfishly shy person but selfishly for all d fans who misses him badly......
Educated actor is quite different attitude  sushant singh .He is a star young actor.why bollywood mafia killed. I am sophei
Very sweet and honest conversation. Such an adorable person <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sushantsinghrajput">#SushantSinghRajput</a> <br>It is so sad that we won&#39;t see him again. The country wants <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushant">#JusticeforSushant</a>. God bless his soul. Thanks for the interview.
Truly an extraordinary person with such simplicity and a very positive &amp; matured attitude towards life.  A very strong character not to get swayed away by the pomoius Bollywood world,  its complicated ways and all the negativity. It&#39;s exciting to listen to someone who speaks with such such honesty, excitement and depth.
I wish u and Ankita were together forever💔
Mmmmm this world missed him .No words
Such a nice interview
I am so hurt really!!! please come back Sushant ...
Miss u Idol ❤️ justice for SSR
Very wise man and intelligent but allowed rhea bitch in his life,and everything is spoiled..yes I also experienced same thing in my life, everything was fine and one wrong devil which I allowed in my life,my whole career spoiled,don&#39;t know God does take  me, but making me to suffer in the form of dying daily with so many regrets,I will say which is more worse then death :&#39;(((
Sushant is soo awesome
So insightful and with utmost clarity of thoughts, such person can never commit suicide.
God&#39;s very much loved kid❣️❣️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
He way more calm, not moving his arms legs hands as much. That&#39;s the calming factor Ankita brings in someone&#39;s life. Post their breakup,  he became restless.  Blinked his eyes continuously ofcourse we loved him in every phase, but I wanted this Sushant. The Sushant that valued Love above all. Not the Sushant that left ankita because of Professional reasons. The calm man who could still read,  watch stars listen to music the SSR that had a shield called Ankita who wouldn&#39;t take him to a bad emotionally like the snake Rhea did.
You are 24kerret Gold...SSR
Happiest interview of sushant
Sushant should not have broken up with Ankita. Secondly why should they have a third person Sandeep Singh living with them? Please. three is a crowd. ok Sandeep piled on saying Bihari connection and Ankita and Sushant took him in.
We should award excellent failures &amp; punish mediocre successes !!!! Wow .....feel bad for not knowing this great gifted guy till now....
This was the best interview of Sushant I&#39;ve evev seen!!! Thank you 🙏🏼 peace be upon him 💔🥀
I have become crazy for him ,like I have been addicted to watch each and  every video in youtube....
❤
Very honest

He would  have been in Hollywood  and they have  given  him what he deserve.bollywood was not for him .The all killed him
This guy had depression? He committed suicide? Who r u kidding u damn fools? 😡This is one guy who had such a positive attitude to life that he would never ever think of taking his own life. This is one guy who cared about how much things excited him rather than the pomp and glamour. He would have found a way ahead smiling even if he became a victim of Bollywood mafia. He was even thinking of doing theater again. He got depressed??? Anyone who suggested such a bizzare bullshit must ge shot to death. He was such an inspiring young man. He was a fine human being first. A very very good friend. His dad lost the only son who they had after so much prayer and waiting. His sisters lost the light of their lives. We, his fans, lost him. Bollywood didn&#39;t deserve him. Shame on the media syndicates who conspired with the bitches and bastards of Bollywood and kept so much information about him from us. I have been noticing cute videos of him popping up in youtube after he left us. Cashing in on his fans pain you bastards?  Whoever is behind his MURDER must be punished. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23jucstice4ssr">#JUCSTICE4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbi4ssr">#CBI4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23janandolan4ssr">#JANANDOLAN4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23curlpritsofssrmustbepunished">#CURLPRITSOFSSRMUSTBEPUNISHED</a>

His enemy was there to stop him from moving towards the happy life
Magar ssr fight mein haar nahi gaye unhe haraya gaya dhoke se bloody looser who kill him.
Shame on film industry  .he didn&#39;t get any Awards for dhoni or kai po che ...or Chichore ...where as people like sooraj Pancholi ,sonam kapoor and alia bhatt get awards 😡😡
Wow.  .he got offered 7 films before Kai Po Che 😯...

Sushant Singh Rajput will always be a inspiration to me.
At the time of opening this video i wanted to click on watch later. <br>But seeing a few minutes,  i was addicted to him. <br><br> He was One of the Rare rare rare persons in this world.
Who&#39;s the lucky one that got the shirt?? Sushii😥😥
What could have possibly gone wrong that they broke up after having those thoughts and feelings about Ankita💔💔
I think this the Only Interview I saw about SushantsinghRajput ❤️, Where he has told his Untold Story in Very Precise manner yet Wonderfully with The Great  Message in the Climax of living life of two Sushant,... Niranjan the Host has been So Lucky to See Sushant&#39;s This Side..like His way of thinking ... Dealing with Different Situations... Ideas behind every Successful Decision he took ..Proud of being in love with Ankita. ..

💔💔
U r soo intelligent n cuteee Sushant 😘😭 love u n missing u soo much
We missed SSR to much. He was very nice person. He was very clever in any subject. He had respects opposite person. Nobody like him in Bollywood. How badly behave some person with him. He was very much dawon to earth.
Oh why he was so intelligent
Somehow I agreed ,he has taken his life...He has no fear of losing anything..not even his own life...must tell you Sush..your intellectuality was your biggest enemy in this dumb nepo film industry..Bhagwan aapki aatma ko param shaanti de!!!
We didn&#39;t have a clue abt his intellectual ..and yes @whatever TM said it rightly that no mainstream media made us aware abt his beautiful mind and ideas..<br><br>This should be the right way to behave after becoming famous or having some achievements in our life ..No bollywood actor is behaving like this or not even thinking this way...<br>Also big bollywood actors are not even raising a voice For SSR fans and his family for his justice..<br>As a audience we need to change our movie selection to good content over Bollywood big actor masala movies...<br>so new concepts and actors will get more chances to bring exciting work for us..also it will help to raise the standard of Indian film industry on international level..<br><br>SSR will always be remembered by us and have become an inspiration for people like me..<br> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sushantsinghrajput">#sushantsinghrajput</a> ✨💞🙏
Great hairdo yar... None is smarter than you r
He clearly said that  a cause of his break up with Ankita would be his onscreen kisses....he was so acutely aware of the impact of this on Ankita...but my question to Ankita would be...being an actress herself, she should have understood that, it  was part of the job he was doing....<br><br>Shahrukh has also many rumoured link ups...Gauri didn&#39;t leave him...she held on to him like a pillar...<br>I wish Ankita didn&#39;t get disillusioned by his on screen romances and stood by his side like a rock....
&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=951">15:51</a>&quot; - &lt;Ankita being patient&gt; he shouldn&#39;t have left Ankita for whatsoever reason. :-(
His demise will not go in vain. It&#39;s high time we support talented people in the industry. Now is the time.
Niranjan is a great interviewer. He didn&#39;t asked controversial questions to him like KJ does. This interview shows SSR was capable of handling the ups and downs of life. His closed ones wouldn&#39;t have left him alone for a moment. RIP.
So candid and philosophical. Miss you so much.
He said he has insomnia... He thinks he is dual personality everything here...  His extraordinary mind seems to be his enemy which was fed by all the Bollywood bullies and also his personal relationship failure .... Sad ending... Had his mother been alive he would have survived... And I&#39;m wondering how come his 4 sisters that too elder ones left him alone when he was so down...! Kangana is standing because of family support... Priyanka Chopra kartik Aryan Vicky kaushal... All stay with their families and survived this hypocritical Bollywood bullies !!!! And yes of course media who.shows every nonsense move of the nepo kids like sonam tiger kapoors Alia .. they shd have given him his due credit and media glare too!!!! It&#39;s indeed sad to see such talented sensitive actor passing away and we realize so late ! Rest in peace Sushant!!!!
❤❤
His confidence, spirit, mind, and every life in him was awake when he was with Ankita or was it just a phase...  In past one year, the way he talks, even his confidence, distracted in interviews which I think is all result of paid media writing him terribly, competition with contemporaries, enemies and all...  So sad we didn&#39;t notice anything. If this was a suicide, I wish we could have helped. If this is a murder, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all these people who shut him off for his brilliance. 💔
He was in a different league altogether.<br>There is no one like him.<br>😢😢😢

The only way to live your life is<br>1. Identify what you are excited about.<br>2. Have the courage to back it up<br>3. Be very very extremely excited about it<br>EVERYTHING WILL COME TO YOUR WAY<br><br>--SSR
We all were so busy watching bollywood rulers/mafias movies as it was heavily promoted by other stars and their strong PR on all social media platforms. In that mode our brain was forcefully made to watch only their trailers and their movies. We were misguided and forgot a self made man and a genuine talent. 😒
We should reward excellent failures and we should punish mediocre successes...Sushant ♥️♥️♥️
So he is claustrophobic? Not the ideal situation during the lockdown
He was a masterpiece 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏whose loss can never be retrieved, Sush you are so lovable and  adorable 😭😭😭😭😭😭,why you left her dear if she was your everything.
Ignoring, laughing &amp; fighting Mashallah but I wish u wuld fight with them and win against them as kangana did
So brilliant! So Sad!
Who kill this pure heart
Cannot even feel my Tears... Just see him anywhere tears roll down my eyes automatically 💔... <br>Will never be able to sleep peacefully until his murderers are Exposed 😭
We lost a beautiful precious gem forever
A person so positive about life so intelligent so inspiring who is so understanding about everything....a person full of life and they say he committed suicide bullshit they killed him bcoz he was a big threat for their career.
Excellent interview 👍❤️💔
Love you sushanth! Missing u!
He was so clear about his thoughts....he is so adorable yaa
After SRK I haven&#39;t seen such a charismatic actor in Bollywood for a long time ... but Sushant appeared and realized that he would be Bollywood&#39;s second Badshah .... such a talented and charismatic actor in Bollywood no longer and will not...Sushant incredible, unique, true talent.<br>and he had to become the second king of Bollywood .. he deserved .it..but... Oh my god, I can’t believe it. He was murdered...Bollywood <br>not interesting for a long time and in general disgraced now..... <br>We are tired a long time ago from  Indian fighting and dance songs in the fields were  .. Sushant brought the world of Bollywood a whole new era ... but stupid and greedy little people only envied him...BASTARDS...they could make a lot of money thanks to him .. why they had to kill him ..they are actors or killers. .. this rhea is a terrible creature .she is knows everything .. it’s in it  .. Indians  ... why are you silent ... they should be punished ..<br>avenge for Sushant.. I don’t know who did it, but even an idiot can understand that this murder was commissioned, and many of Bollywood are involved in this ..But whose hand was raised to take the life of a person ???. A strong man is not the one who can take life, but the one who can save it. There will be no rest for those who committed this crime, the soul of Sushant will not allow them to live in peace... I hate to all-stars and THEIR CHILDREN AND  relatives THAT PLAY IN INDIAN MOVIES ... I am Tired of watching on these talentless persons,  which are just grimacing. .And even after death, Sushant remains an unrivaled Bollywood actor after Amitabh Bachchan and SRK ..and .. the one and only Sushant ... we love him ... he will always live in our hearts ... no one can compare with him. Never. let his killers know that he was dear, young, talented played better than anyone, played with soul ..he is a legend and the love of the people cannot be taken away .. we will never forget him ...<br>....just enough... BOLLYWOOD DIED FOR ME.I think it’s worth watching Indian cinema anymore. The whole era has gone on with the Sushant. HE has NOT DIED... HE LIVES IN OUR HEARTS ...WE WILL REVENGE FOR him... I swear...God sees everything .
The way he speaks, expression so innocent - feel like crying. We lost a beautiful soul, he was not very expressive on its own and was unable to distinguish his friends and enemies - it all got mixed up. He would have been easily next superstar. Come back yaar :(
Kissi ki nazar lag gayi Sushant n Ankita love story. Miss u Sushant.
Sushant bhai i just feel your pain how they brutally murdered you they r not human beings they r jallad
We never admired this beautiful person when he was alive. What mostly happened was gossiping, backbiting. Now suddenly the whole world is awake to admire the person he was. You know regret is much more powerful than gratitude. RIP Susant. I am sure you must be in a better world now.
Bestestestest.....Person actor dancer ....In Bollywood ....He is an iitian.....Stop call him an engineer...
Rhea should  see this and say Sushant  is talking
🌷
First in India, people normally prefer sons. It seems after 4 sisters their parents still wanted son. Being youngest and alone son he must be getting extra attention of parents which creates siblings rivalry. This rivalry only goes away when all kids do best in their life and they&#39;re satisfied with their life. <br>If we see here, the two sisters shweta and Nitu were doing well (Money and secure family). But the other two Ritu and Mitu(blue shirt one) may not be doing well in life, they&#39;re not even connected on social media with siblings. Only Sushant Nitu and Shweta (the three well settled) were connected on social media. Sushant himself confessed money is extremely important for our family. <br>These things also create further siblings rivalry.
I loved Byomkesh Bakshi. The movie was good. He looked like Robert Downey Jr. in the movie
Miss you Sushant
Most of the science students are introvert and shy. They focus on studies and this is the one thing which they can do best.
Things exist infront of us but that very moment we can&#39;t see its purity but we actually realise about the facts only when we stay a distance far from it or in other words when things are gone forever..... He will b the most unique and intelligent young superstar till my death....❤️❤️❤️❤️Love you for what u were and hope to cherish my life just like yours..... God bless ur soul with peace.... 🙏😘
miss you sushant .♥️
This is much better than koffee with karan
Truth will prevail. , Sushant Singh Rajput will have justice  .....
Beautiful actor with brains
This man cannot commit suicide for he has very well embraced the harsh realities of bollywood and life... Though he stated that he can deal with failure and not gossip, there is something fishy about his death for there were so many blind articles on purpose written for him to sabotage his career. Bollywood, you are a swamp of filth... Shame on all big stars who are so quiet till today...
After listening to this interview, I think  Ankita became very much possessive about him. She should have understand that he was an actor. But .. luv you sushi♥️😣 you were a true and an honest guy
He is looking so happy introducing himself
Best interview  God bless his soul
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=900">15:00</a> that&#39;s why I feel never open up in public about your love life or any future plans..... coz Nazar lag jati h.....I am an educated person but firmly believe in this.... The jealous society couldn&#39;t bear their togetherness &amp; they parted unfortunately
The way he was.....any girl could fall in love with him!!!
😭 do u knoe Sushant, we all r missing u a lot a lot a lot... Aaa lot
Met many people but not like him.. He is something different.. Very few people are like him
Best intrerviee of sushant i hav ever scene.....he looks so charm in dis......
Sushant 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏❣
Miss you so much Shushant. .pls come back.. CBI Enquiry for Shushant Singh Rajput
He is very cool, intelligent, honest and loyal person. But why is he saying that it&#39;s very difficult to deal with him and live with him for long time?
Can anyone tell me the meaning of the poem he was saying when he was talking about Ankita?
When you smile your eyes is also smile
Sushant was a very honest and true person his thoughts and stories always remain same year after year all his words are 100% true
😪😪😪
Why did he keep saying,&quot;it&#39;s very difficult to live/stay with me&quot;? 🧐🤨😒 The video after 24th minute takes a eerie turn. Him talking about death, about his thoughts swinging like a pendulum.
U r soooooo innocent dear sushant..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=704">11:44</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=718">11:58</a>......🙂🖤<br>why you left us like this Sushi??<br>This is definitely not done, this is not fair 💔
Media never post  such interviews about him. So, that we must know much about him. <br>Real legend <br>God send him again
CBI inquiry
Such  great talent
&quot;&quot;People first ignore you<br>Then they will laugh at u<br>Then they will fight with  U<br>Then they will fight for U&quot;<br>***People now fight for ur Justice @SSR ❤❤❤
What a brilliant guy he is. Hats off.
He deserves to Justice....<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nocbinovote">#noCBInoVote</a>
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jyqRp9ZrZw&amp;t=715">11:55</a>, at the end of the day this yrf is the reason of all his problems and his sudden demise.
Everyone need ek sache Humsafar. they can understand more easily and deeply
Watch my channel to know Sushant singh Rajput Murder at 3:30 am?? CBI/Fudge /Sushants Rebirth Relationship with Ankita lokhanday/Kirti Shanon via Tarot Card Reading....Justice for sushant singh Rajput 🙏🙏😥😥😥💔
Very sorted, honest, genuine, gem of a person..love you sushant to the moon and back...
how amazing this man🤩🤩<br>we miss you Sushant..
Yeah of course like most of them commented.... He is very intellectual, very talented, in one word he’s a “All rounder “. No one in the entire film kingdom is like him.... a gem and only Handsome and very good Actor. Can’t be compared to anyone else. More than any other comments He is very good human being and his goodness  could be seen on his face very clearly. Hardworker guy. We all really miss this amazing guy.
when SSR was with Ankitha  he was so happy
Best interview
Miss u shusu, aise kaise duniya chhod sakte ho tum
If Sushant &amp; Ankita would have married this wouldn&#39;t have happened...we wouldn&#39;t be missing him too much as much as we are missing him every day💓❣️He deserved love by a woman like Ankita &amp; not by witchcraft woman Rhea Chakraborty...<br>Very adorable, intelligent &amp; ideal person...<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sushant">#Sushant</a>🌈💫💔
I miss you sushant sir...
Respect and honour to the world power caring thankyou thankyou thankyou so much angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles Angles from Kenya beautiful beautiful beautiful journey soul heaven on earth
Can we undo things ?? We need him 😥😥
You were really a true person
what a interview !!!
There is no difference between<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ssr">#SSR</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23michaeljackson">#MichaelJackson</a><br>Both of them were misunderstood by us..<br>And both of them left early..<br>It&#39;s r failure...😣☹️☹️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkIUx8u-gV0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkIUx8u-gV0</a>
People will frst ignore u, then laugh at u, then fight with u and after then u achieve wht u want. Acc to this interview he was in laugh off state and past few yrs he was in fighting state nd......... He achieved peace wht anyone desires in life bt in very ironic way😢
But he lost the FIGHT
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUc2LRVL6H0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUc2LRVL6H0</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZAT9WaWBUA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZAT9WaWBUA</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpkQKFqexs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpkQKFqexs</a><br><br>Was Sushant’s sister at crime scene wearing blue t shirt? Who can prove it?  That woman’s face is covered by mask &amp; hair. Her behaviour is highly suspect through out the video.      Her entire reaction is odd      Please prove that is truly sister.<br><br> The family is being threatened by the murders, they are highly well connected criminals .    I think the sisters do not have guts to challenge   the killers.
Seriously the way he talked about Ankita..the love was inevitably true between them..His intelligence and uniqueness was only understood by Ankita..his backbone..he said that he can&#39;t do without her..in this i.v. he is having a satisfaction and peace and after breakup he must have shattered so does Ankita..It was a shock for all the fans back then at the time of their breakup..I wish these two soulmates could have met in this world itself...but not all wishes come true..It&#39;s a tragic ending.. Really talented and honest Actor and human he was...RIP Sushant..🙏🙏
We really din deserve you..
BOYCOTT BOLLYWOOD 🤯🤯🤯<br># justice for SSR
Somebody needs to cry out to the human rights commission again to release our Sushant’s movie on the big screen. We need to to heights to get his movie released on the big screen. Its a movie that deserves that glory as we will be watching him for one last time on big screen
We need Dil Bechara on the big screen
A true soul
I had to stop for 5 times to record his thoughts &amp; words. He had such deep insight,philosophical sense and could express these intricate thoughts in such an articulated way! 🖤🖤
Purely an intelligent,philosophical introvert.Great guy .

Wish he went ahead for being a scientist or an astronaut, his aura was such , he will have been loved everywhere he would have ever gone or  would have gone. :(
How happy he was...we want CBI investigation bohut jald..
16.10 - 16.19 ❤️
Sushant become very busy being a superstar, n Ankita became insecure n then when they fight. Ankita flirted in party with others in absence of Sushant  which Sushant can&#39;t digest. And that was the reason of their break-up( because introvert person don&#39;t easily forgive). Otherwise Sushant really love Ankita.
Hear him out from 14.12↗️15.00.<br>He was not the guy to give it up.A v honest man indeed<br>Inspite of all the discrepancy happening with him In the bad Bollywood he was still satisfied with himself.<br>Yes he was murdered <br>And yes he will get justice <br>Coz he was Truthful and honest
He was so special that&#39;s why he was for short period of time with us.... We people didn&#39;t deserve him
Very expressive <br>And True to Core🤍

Too loving to watch you out... Yaah there is something beyond explainable in you, which attracts everyone..We miss you dear...You are truly Amazing Amazing...
Why these interviews were not uploaded before his demise
I can n want to listen to this manhood for many many hours...
I regret watching byomkesh bakshi so late ,its one of the finest piece of art.
Ssying he is an introvert, but he speaks so good wen he does.
We really miss you sushant 😢😢
He is so lovely 😘
No matter big goals and even if you achieve ,but,nothing changes in actuality <br>Great philosophy towards life ,Sushant Singh Rajput and <br>I believe he was murdered ,Justice should be done to Sushant Singh Rajput ,by,honestly investigating the Case
Woh bohutt jeena chahty the aisa lgg  raha hai woh chillla chilla kar yeh hi baat bol rhy hain mai marna nhi chahta tha 🙏😭😭😭😭😭😭pta nhi us bndy ke sath kitna glt hua hai jo etny din ho gye lekin chain nhi na din ko naa raat ko bs ekk chiz mind mein ghoom rhi sushant sushant sushant sushant 😭😭😭
His sparkling eyes and lovely smile 😊 you are an angle...
&quot;Why this reticence?&quot; ...you can&#39;t ask this to an introvert, shy person  ...it&#39;s just a personality type....stop treating it as an oddity 🙄
Surprising, Shamak has also not expressed his grief on the murder of Sushanth.
Why God why ?😭
He was extremely ahead of his time, soo far sighted, intelligent, wise, matured person, we&#39;ve really lost a precious GEM ❤️❤️❤️
Amazing interview. .. he is very charming . Sad to see a tragic ending of his life.... CBI inquiry plzz who ever did this has panga with the wrong guy .... justice for sushant❤❤❤❤
One of my favourite interviews. His innocence shines through  and his charm.
Sushant....you were a jewel of jewels but still you finished your life. I will remember you in my whole life. 😭😭
😢
This interview  will help many people for their  present  and future  <br>excellent  both of them <br>speechles  about Sushant
I m just wondering why his sisters are behaving so weired. Why aren&#39;t they asking for CBI enquiry.. why it feels like they don&#39;t have feel of his death.
whtt aa incredible man you r sushant.... one of my fav interview of bollywood celebs i love you n respect you alottt...u r alwys in our hearts.. n yess we will fighting for your justice.. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23breakthesilenceforsushant">#breakthesilenceforsushant</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#justiceforssr</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbienquiryforsushant">#cbienquiryforsushant</a>
Inosunt sushant  boycott Bollywood
After listening to his interviews ,I really cant believe that such an optimistic person how can take such step ,how can he really give up so soon with the struggle in life  ...People will always get jealous of your success and they will try to pull you down but it doesn&#39;t mean we will give up ,Even if there is some problem in our personal life ...but we will overcome only if we stay strong ..God knows if it is a Murder or Suicide whatever it is we have lost such a great telnet so soon...!!
Genius 👍👍👍
Omg such a lovely  interview  ,cant get it out of my mind what he say about ankita ,he really love her and she really love him
His intellect reflects on his face...how much bright he&#39;s looking here! We just didn&#39;t deserve him.

Does anybody realise how calm and gentle soul he is🥺 I haven’t seen any other actor soooooo extremely calm and loving like sushant🥺 why is he gone.... I still don’t get it I still can’t digest that he is no more ☹️😫😭😭
Will you fight for justice for Sushant???
See......<br>He was not the one who will fall for stupid things,<br>Listen to him carefully....<br>He can&#39;t kill himself coz he love himself nd he is so clear about his dreams...<br>It&#39;s not possible to accept that he ended his own life.<br>Bollywood have to pay for this
Justice
I m damn sure Sushant had many plans...in his mind...He started a company! May b after some films he would start a NGO or campaign for social service OR ppl themself offer him seat for MLA nd he would become MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT or ENGINEERING....and then MAy b he had plans for fighting as President....nd nd nd Then who knows he would company &amp; company &amp; be the Next BILL GATES !!!!!!! He is too much for everything. Blessing was his fuel.He could do each nd everything....
What a role model for young Indians! Indian cinema needed the actors like him but cruelly snatched from us. What a loss for India.
He looks so hot with this hair cut ♥️
Rip sushant, we all know that it&#39;s a murder, trying to get you justice, love you
..can everyone notice the sadness in his eyes
Cannot believe he is just so intelligent...
he really loved ankita and she too loved him <br>they will meet again ❤️ some day some where again destiny will play its magic
m sad to discover him sooooo late bt i only did cz i wanna knw abt him .....my mind didnt accept abt hs death even i dnt knw him......my guts said murdr suspicious...... n i search search search hm n everywhere i found him lively passionate happy energetic enthusiastic.... thou he knws the reality of life n death we all do acknowledged abt ths in life abt our death !!!.....bt ths uncertainty ws an evil turner in life....may they never fund peace who cause his death
Very genious and intellectual personality...we always miss u SSR ..
Its going to be a month in few days since he had gone still I m not able to process it .I hope he is rest n peace now.i wish to meet him one day,also want to tell him that we loved you dude why did do that .anyways we can&#39;t change the past ..I hope u r happy now
It does feel very very bad, that he is no more. Wasn’t a fan, but to see such a nice guy die so young is sad.
Best Hero Bollywood will ever see
He lived life King size
Cherish that t- shirt😢sushant definitely is a gem 😢😢😢😢
He looks soooo happy with lit up eyes n such genuine smile n something that says he is sooooo excited of all the things coming his way .... ufff. .... wish he stayed in that zone always .... love u Sushant
He is an Extraordinary personality...always miss U...
Too intelligent,humble person
People loves u very much sushanth.
To honest  to honest  to honest. Sushant, you are sooooo innocent for this cruel world.
If Ankita would have been there with Sushant...... everything would have been beautiful......kaash vo shaadi kr lete
Love love love....... love you sushant
SSR, the Brightest Star in the universe, I really wished that after seeing this brilliant interview, I would rather be congratulating &amp; wishing him every possible success for the future.....<br>But alas, I hope &amp; pray that JUSTICE PREVAILS for Sushant Singh Rajput. I very strongly believe that this dynamic robust soul would have dealt with &amp; overcome any obstacle in his life if he was not brutally murdered. <br>It is still totally heartbreaking, you will be sadly &amp; dearly missed.................
Such an honest guy SSR.
Very clear... very honest... will miss u ssr
U cud have inspired a huge number of people.. u should have stayed...u cud have changed the definition of actors in bollywood..
Cofee with karan se yeh show kitna acha h waha pe to chakka bakwas karta h
He was damn sexy...He was unique....
Seriously... as much as I m seeing him talking ... exploring... it seems he was really different from crowd ... a great artist between us
here he express his love for Ankita and he even said he would not know what he will do without her..... sad to see this. Ankita lost one of the best man in her life and i don&#39;t think she will ever be happy in her life as Sushant will keep haunting her through.
He was full of life,but this dirty bollywood took that life out of him..we just lost him
The most intelligent,brilliant and humble actor by far....just look at him the spark to do something different each day....pure inspiration to <a href="http://all.you/">all.You</a> will alwaz be alive in our hearts <a href="http://forever.be/">forever.Be</a> happy and stay blessed.
Sushant I deeply miss you..

We want Justice for Sushant sing rajput it’s not a suicide it’s a big mistry of plan murder that&#39;s true. We demand CBI enquiry for Sushant sing rajput&#39;s mistry of plan murder. We will miss u love u Sushant sing rajput never forget u &amp; u&#39;r smiling face rest in peace.
He is such a talent..  world will keep missing you Sushant , but u will remain alive forever in people&#39;s hearts ..
I came here to see what ppl commented 5 years ago.
He said he was Claustrophobic. <br>I&#39;m sure his near one&#39;s knew that and took advantage of it that day.
The way he said &#39;I cannot do without her &#39;<br>and sadly he couldn&#39;t.
Shushant how can you be a fans if sharuk khan he don’t deserve you he is so arrogant king khan no and never
Intelligent Amazing sensitive unique god gifted child, justice for Sushant Singh Rajput CBI Investigation for Sushant Singh Rajput 🙏
I can here him long day
He was very gentle guy
We always miss SUSHANT SR..
Cants believe his no more .. what a positive Man 😔..
Sushant was very  intelligent,  had great  visions of his life, emotional,hardworking, brilliant  actor.  He told  everyone  how was their long love  life,  then why did you both wait so long to get married???? <br>As my experience, marriage ( पवित्र  शादी का बंधन) bonds  two  lovely people  together, specially  &quot;Bharatiya Shadi&quot;  and brings lots of luck, and opportunities too, ofcourse there are argument in relationships,  its normal.<br>If they were married  Sushant  and Ankita could  be more  successful. <br>&quot;Togetherness is strength &quot;<br>We all will remember this both  Sushant  Ankita as a lovers too.<br>God bless  Ankita, for her is extremely hard to bare Sushant lost.
He was an extraordinary person.... please come back 😥
Baby come back please
Miss you always shusant 😪😪😪😪😪😪
Victim of mobbing and bullying by the industry, needs investigating definitely time to bring the bullies to their knees just like they did in the USA. Epstein and Weinstein.
This world is full of cruel people. How they killed   such a brilliant, good human being. God, please help us. We want justice. We want cbi enquiry.
This person cannot commit suicide, sure it&#39;s a murder
Really very clear cut answers .. we lost a gem
He was brilliant, handsome and a very very good human being.We lost a superstar.
I am feel very very sad .after watching this interview.
