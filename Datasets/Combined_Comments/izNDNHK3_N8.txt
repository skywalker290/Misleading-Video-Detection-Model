Oh my God!
Gee, what do you know, a skyscraper on fire &amp; it&#39;s still standing....mmmm. probably because thermite or explosives weren&#39;t used. I guess Larry silverstein didn&#39;t purchase this one &amp; double the insurance before this fire.
I guess the left side of the tower was still OK, that being the elevators still functioning, water, heat still functioning, electricity still funtioniong.
That horrid cladding is to blame for quite a few fires in Russia and satellite states
bldg on fire ๏╭╮๏
RT is not to be believed for any reason because of no independent reporters and complete control by the Russian government. I DO NOT Subscribe to RT!!!
When will this trend of stuccoed styrofoam fake masonry cladding ever end?  Once hot that stuff is like kerosene.
How are you supposed to fight fires like that where ladders can’t reach up to the top
I read a lot of hate comments and people saying that they wish there were moslims in there... Sorry but I can&#39;t stand this.. First if all this is not fake cuz when I went to grozny after that happened they were resetting it... Second if you have a life then don&#39;t write hate comments... Cuz I want my country Chechnya not be hated like that...<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ilovechechnya">#ilovechechnya</a>
I wonder why the fire didnt turn the steel into molted lava like the fire did to the twin towers
its terrorism all the sudden in the US  Britian Russia and so on they will not admit it.
burn baby burn
yet another cladding fire...
This must have the same material of cladding like the grenfell tower see how the fire traveled up the side like that, wow.

I cannot understand how flammable panels are legal to install on the exteriors of highrise buildings. Similar videos show this same type of fire occurring in France and Dubai, in addition to this one in Russia.
Notice how the smoke is black? No Thermite to create and consume it&#39;s own oxygen in this fire. Look on YT, how many high rise fires there are. They happen quite frequently. Yet the only ones that have ever collapsed at free-fall speeds in their footprints are in New York.
what was that building constructed from  that could allow flames to spread up the outside corner like that .shocking design
omfg we have just had a house fire 1 hower ago omfg it was so scery i saved evry one and i am going to be put in the news paper
Развели капитализм. И вот как строить стали. Строить надо нормально, а не горючие утеплители ставить.
Yup another building burning for more than an hour, that all of a sudden did fall down at near free fall speed.  These flames are top to bottom, now go a look at building 7.  Only a moron buys the official story
That is one ugly ass building.
that fire is far more intense than the 9/11 fires. where&#39;s the free fall exploding collapse sending several ton debris hundreds of feet laterally and subsequent pyroclastic dust cloud?
crazy
It&#39;s &quot;Grozny-City Towers&quot; on Wikipedia
Friaf
+Terry Hollas, enginners said that the world trade center were solid enough to take more plane crash and they would still stand strong, Plus according to the government the crash itself did not made the towers collapse, it was the fire and The fire ONLY that made those tower collapse and this is according to the government not me. by the way explain Building 7? No plane but still collapses at free fall?
fly 2 jumbo jets into it and see what happejns
I hope this building is still around... The fire couldn&#39;t have made it not structurally sound...
same builder as the France video?
Очень жаль! Тому кто это сделал надо руки сжечь!
The fire was not in the % Star Hotel. This building was luckily still not inhabited. The cause of the fire was Electrical. What was burned was the exterior only, the interior (Completely Empty) was not harmed. <br>The building has already been restored longtime ago. I don&#39;t know where Russia Today gathered the information.<br>I am commenting quotation from other people. I was living in Grozny at the time of the fore and I was working in the Hotel next to the burned building. Regardless the reasons of the fire,, it was a big loss, but it has opened the eyes on improving the fire fighting methods and equipment, as there will be more high rise building coming up in Grozny. 
Also only the decorative coating burned
Apparently in Russia they build skyscrapers out of paper glued together with gasoline. 
We&#39;ve had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.&quot; And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.
someone forgot the thermite to cut the I beams so the building could fall down..... and dont forget the planes and the over paid news to hound the shit out of this story like the alquida came over and flew into big building and blew it all up. kinda sounds like a five year old would make up that story, oh wait it was a inside job.
The firefighters weren&#39;t the least bit afraid of the building collapsing because hydrocarbon fires don&#39;t melt steel. If they did, there could be no such thing as a wood stove. 
Really? you people say 9/11 was an inside job and fake because this building did not collapse just as the world Trade Center did? Completely different fire circumstances. This building was not high impacted by a jet liner that damaged the building&#39;s structure and injected jet fuel inside the building.
you must call Larry Silverstein to &quot;pull&quot; this building...
Thats when you use a styrofoam based insulating material on the walls of a building.  It&#39;s like putting solid gasoline on the walls, because in case of a fire the insulation melts and liquifies and pretty much burns like gasoline.
But they didn&#39;t collapse, hmm there must be something missing...
It didn&#39;t collapse because this fire wasn&#39;t caused by &quot;Jewish lightning&quot;
Yet it did not collapse... How weird..
What a joke you are, you can&#39;t even decide what you are.
skyscraper &quot;Olympus&quot; will be renamed to &quot;Phoenix&quot; good move =)
I think the biggest problem with this fire was that no Jew set it on fire,it works different then.
Oh, so you&#39;re wahabi trash or your family is, gotchya.
It&#39;s a &quot;fact&quot; because you think that&#39;s the way it works? Wrong, that&#39;s how it worked when the Jihadists were in power taking orders from their Saudi Masters.
look at the Madrid hotel after burning for over twenty hours.
If that was true ( i don&#39;t believe everyone thinks 9/11 was an inside job ) then i fear for our futures because we are not doing shit about it.
Only thing subuman are fascists, for their mental capability is limited in reach and scope.
You are not Russian infact according to the year your account was created, you are likely a child, an american child at that.
They do.
Grozny is Chechnya and not Russia !!!! 

My god bless our brothers in Chechnya ! Es selamu  Alyekum we rahmetullah we berekatuh  to all from Bosnia :) 
COMUNISTS tring to scare chechnya so sad
Shouldn&#39;t thus building have disintegrated instantaneously as it fell into its footprint
Chechens voted, they are russian citizens, Grozny is Russia.
Have you ever seen gasoline explode? when it explodes it consumes most of it&#39;s fuel instantly, Now imagine jet fuel with a higher octane(meaning greater expansion thus better performance) then gasoline exploding, that fuel is used instantly, now even if that fuel doesn&#39;t burn up all at once(which it does) it doesn&#39;t burn at a temperature that can melt steel.

Illinois is the word your looking for. Chicago is a city, Illinois is the state that it&#39;s in, and the USA is the country that it&#39;s a part of.
Fuck you. And Russia. And anyone else who consider commenting on this.
Well... Am I the only one still waiting?
I know, right!
It is getting crazy! I was watching a video about a cat and a squirrel playing together and someone actually turned that into a 9/11 discussion. The funny thing was that several of the usual 9/11 shills showed up within hours of the convo turning to 9/11. It really freaked me out.
Yeah, well none of that would have happened if the just would have constructed the towers from Passport Material!
&quot;there&#39;s a hole at the side&quot;

You are thinking of the WTC like it is a solid block. The hole on the side of the building is mostly cosmetic- most of the building&#39;s load was borne by the central structure. When it gave way due to the sagging of large portions of unsupported floor, it collapsed straight downwards because there was no significant force acting upon it other than gravity. There was no significant wind nor imbalance of loads to cause a tipping motion.
&quot;it&#39;s just an office fire&quot;
granted, the jet fuel burned away within minutes, but it&#39;s not any ordinary office fire. An ordinary fire starts at a single source and can be brought under control with some effort by the fire department. 9/11 was a widespread fire that took place in a building with most of its fireproofing blown away. Essentially, it became an unmanagable fire within seconds of the plane hitting the building.
The new skyscrapers being built in East Asia are of a different, more modern design than the World Trade Center. They are constructed out of evenly spread reinforced concrete columns. The concrete keeps the steel rigid and in place even in a heavy fire. In contrast, the WTC was constructed out of pure steel, with a single core to support the building. This allowed for much more sagging. Besides, most building fires are not caused by a 150 foot long molotov cocktail.
Fick obeythepro. Slava VSEJ Rossii!
Allah gave it, Allah took it away..
Fuck russia
Aww look at all these Government Trolls roaming around here with their cute little numbered names trying to convince you that an Apple is an Orange xD
- 9/11 Zionist Job.
Why is everyone still bringing 9/11 up? Everyone already knows it was a inside job
Yea man, that is. :)
People call me terrorist, but i consider myself as a fictional character
did osama also do that?

oh wait, osama didnt exist
and who do you think destroyed WTC ?
Wrong, in the debris, they founded MELTED remains of the I-Beams, actual liquified beams, the ends of them were melted. Thermite much?
Another problem would stem from the fact that both buildings were hit by fast-moving jets flying at 590 MPH and 490 MPH respectively, severing many columns even before the fires WEAKENED them, not MELTED them. The fires burnt at temperatures that, though not hot enough to melt steel, caused the steel to lost half of it&#39;s strength, causing the floors to sag and pull in the walls. Eventually, the walls couldn&#39;t take it, and both towers fell.
not rusians chechens
Well, easy to spot gay and lesbian folks when they aren&#39;t exonerated by a government which publicly declares wars and conducts crusades on them.  The majority of Americans are indeed European, but many of us still are native Americans, African Americans, south Americans, and other nationalities following.  
Just because some asshole who doesn&#39;t know a Muslim from an Arab, or doesn&#39;t know the Islamic religion, doesn&#39;t mean you should ostracize one country which DOES have culture and heritage.
Problem is jet fuel burns hotter than normal fire..??
and WTC7
&quot;YOU MUPPET&quot;
1 look at your channel proves 1 thing (TROLL)
1 last thing EXPERT! - on  Febuary12th, The Windsor Tower (Madrid)  Burned (WHITE HOT) for hours AND hours - after it died out the crane was still standing atop of it? - you must agree that the ONLY steel built buildings EVER to collapse due to fire are WTC1 AND WTC2
Building 7 collapsed at 5;20pm on 9-11 - please can u explain how it was on the BBC News at 5pm on 9-11?
The same rubble they have hidden so nobody can analyze or see it? Just like all the video tapes of the pentagon? Just like the hundreds of things they could easily release and prove the official story is true, yet they cant? 

The official story is the conspiracy theory.
I don&#39;t know how you deduced from my comment that I believe in official story... maybe because you are stupid troll and you cant read?:)
All of this is public information, i&#39;ll copy-paste 1 of my previous explanation for WTC7; 
WTC7 fell due to massive column damage &amp; fire damages all caused by WTC2 falling debris. All WTC and other non-WTC [bankers trust for example] also had massive damage from tower fallout, but WTC received more damage than the rest due to angle. 
WTC7 didn&#39;t fall on its footprint, research Barclay street in 911. Barclay street never was WTC7 footprint.
the fires at WTC gave off black smoke?.....FUCK THAT SHIT - Please Explain Building 7 Collapse?........ you seem to be an EXPERT!
THEY FOUND AND CONFIRMED NANO THERMITE IN THE RUBBLE. THAT IS THE SMOKING GUN OF THIS WHOLE THING.
--if that was a terrorist attack created by america like the 9-11...then that will already colapse like magic--
Shhhh they put you in the FEMA camps. LOL!!!
Why didn&#39;t it collapse in to it&#39;s own footprint at freefall speed Like building 7? wow my brain just cant imagine how it didn&#39;t collapse!?
I use too say if i ever get rich, I want too live in a high rise. Now I changed my mind.
I hope everyone got out alive. I live Chicago in a basement apartment. I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ll be the first one out.
Believe it or not; barbecue columns don&#39;t have to support hundreds of tons worth of weight. 
WTC columns did. 
ps; barbeque metal also weakens with heat, this is a universal law of physics.
CHARCOAL BURNS AT 600-1300 DEGREES WHY HAS NOT ALL BARBECUE GRILL NOT HAVE COLLAPSED?
Basically, this; /watch?v=bMZ-nkYr46w
What did he say?
Leslie E. Robertson [the chief engineer of the project] was crystal clear on WTC design &amp; on what caused its collapse in 911. 
Questions?
pancake theory is a lie.  911 was an inside job.
This is possibly the most nonsensical waffle disguised as argument I&#39;ve seen in a while. A falling floor would have collapsed a column? Only the same way a falling sheet of paper would collapse an upright pencil. Absolute drivel. The towers were designed as 1 piece? 1 floor fell everything fell? I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t work in NY if that&#39;s how you think buildings are designed. May as well demolish the whole of Manhattan if that&#39;s how it&#39;s been built....fkin deathtrap.
I&#39;m not sure if you knew this but Palestinians are not recognized as a nation until very recently. Everytime a palestinian leaves his country via an airplane legally he has to have an israeli passport meaning in the international community, since they&#39;re not considered palestinians by paper, they&#39;re considered israeli. This is the kind of &#39;&#39;israeli&#39;&#39; that danced in 911; /watch?v=-8b3vhTO248
What makes you think that a falling floor wouldn&#39;t have crushed the core column? The core column wasn&#39;t  built to handle the kinetic energy of a falling floor [remember what i told you about a bowling ball?], this according to Leslie, the engineer who designed the WTC. Your only sources are people who think they know more than the designers of the WTC about what the WTC columns could or couldn&#39;t handle. WTC towers were designed as 1 piece, 1 floor fell everything fell. I call shenanigans!
If the core columns along with the rest of the building was intact below the impact point, there is no way that the WTC would have collapsed.
Maybe there would have been a partial collapse above the impact point but nothing like we saw that day. 
There was no force that could have pushed down and break all these columns below impact point.

Apart from that I think that NIST report is crap.
I don&#39;t believe in nibirus or iluminatis. So much paranoia in your little head I can see.

If by research you mean the official story then most likely I have done more research than you had ever done. 

The reason why the WTC didn&#39;t collapsed due to fire and jet fuel. 
Watch the entire video and pay attention to how the core columns were designed.

Follow the link.
/watch?v=qJ11i6fi7KQ
It&#39;s on video, what more proof do you want? 
Mossad agents? Well......it&#39;s good to see what conspiracy theories you&#39;re paranoia leans to. I guessed it was going to be aliens, illuminati or nibirus but it seems you chose the good ol&#39; JEWS.
NIST report states the only realistic scenario &amp; it is backed by Leslie E. Robertson, the engineer of the complex. 
15% of WTC columns were broken by the Boeing, the Boeing crash also cleared off the fireproofing in the floors of the crash [you can take off fire proofing with your bare hands, a Boeing crash &amp; explosion wouldn&#39;t have a problem]. 
The fire kept weakening the steel which inevitably gave [the rest of the tower was pulled down with the falling floor]. 
This is science, not paranoia.
I said that aluminum [mostly from the Boeing 767] melted inside WTC, not that the girders of the WTC were made out of aluminum.
If i could i would go to your house, take you with me to a time machine, go to 911, fly to where the planes crashed &amp; take a sample.......but unfortunately the technology to do half of  that doesn&#39;t exist. 
Research how aluminum oxyde looks when melted, notice the similarities with that video taped in WTC? 
This is all i can do for you C:
Did that joker just claim that the girders of the WTC were aluminum? Aluminum fatigues so quickly that it fails regularly when used (rather than steel or carbon fiber) on bike frames. Aluminum does not have the ability to flex without being compromised. I think he was kidding.
That is indeed a fact..but entirely irrelevant. Calling it jet fuel doesn&#39;t change the fact that it&#39;s basically kerosene. There weren&#39;t any fires burning long enough and hot enough to cause the failures needed for a major collapse. NIST&#39;s hypotheses are just that. They&#39;re not based on fact or physical evidence, and run contrary to video and eyewitness testimony. Far from explaining what occurred, they merely explain what couldn&#39;t have. 
Steel bars don&#39;t melt with jetfuel heat, aluminum does, and obviously there was jetfuel burning inside WTC...........unless you think the impact videos were all hollograms from illuminati alien nibirus? Were the jetgear &amp; jet engines that fell into streets also hollograms? LOL 
It&#39;s not simply the jets size, but its jetfuel volume. In case you didn&#39;t know; iron bars take time to heat up completely. A 10 minute fire wont completely raise a skyscraper iron bars temperature. The longer the fire, the hotter an object gets. Commercial jets from 1970 didn&#39;t carry as much jetfuel as a 767, that&#39;s FACT. 

The planes&#39; impact doesn&#39;t figure too highly in the official reason for the towers&#39; collapse so what difference does it make whether it was a 767, 747 or  the millennium falcon? The planes are just there to confuse the feeble minded into thinking they&#39;re the cause. 
You should do more research on WTC, especially on its construction. WTC was built to withstand impact from any commercial aircraft from the early 1970&#39;s. BUT the aircraft that hit WTC in 911 was far larger than any commercial aircraft in the 1970&#39;s. The B-767 is not only larger than any commercial aircraft in 1970, but it also carries far more fuel [20,000 gallons of jetfuel]. 
WTC was not built to withstand this impact. 
A tank from 1920 may be bullet proof in 1920 but not in 1940. 
WAKE UP
Buddy you are alone on this. Open your mind, seriously. I ones used to believe the official story until, I started to think for myself. 

The official story does not make any sense at all.
These buildings were built to stand anything including an airliner impacting at 500Mph. Do your research without relying on official sources.

Don&#39;t waste your energy defending those bastards. 
Jeeeeeezzzzzzz, 
i just wrote a sentence, you didn&#39;t have to write me a book. 
You just showed buildings falling, all buildings fall down but that does not mean that the cause of the fall [what&#39;s happening inside] is the same thing. In UFC &amp; boxing people can be knocked out but that doesn&#39;t mean the knock outs are the same, in boxing it has to be with hands while in UFC it can be done with a kick. A knock out is a knock out but methods are different. 

You have nothing, the video speaks for itself. 
And calling me kid only proves you are just a crazy arrogant with nothing in your brain but some obsessive compulsive behavior. 

You are alone, fighting against everyone else who can see for themselves.

You are the one who is behaving like a kid here, spamming this channel with lies. 
Don&#39;t you realize that you are actually the only one here supporting all these lies?. 
You are alone with your lies.

You should stop supporting lies and open your mind and listen the people who have been investigating what happened that day. 
Seriously, there is no point in supporting the official story no one decently informed believes it.
You&#39;ve showed me that video several times &amp; i have demonstrated its flaws 3 times already. How many more times do we have to go over this kid? 
Wrong!!!

/watch?v=_x4Jq9FTli

Seriously, get informed, the official story is for ignorant brainwashed people. Are you one of them?.
Of course the steel did not become molten, but the aluminum did become molten. I&#39;ve seen aluminum become molten from gasoline fire, jetfuel fire does the job easier. 
Also; why would anyone want war in afghanistan? Afghanistan doesn&#39;t even have oil. 
Bush had warplans for afghanistan because of all the terrorist in there [911 wasn&#39;t the 1st time terrorist attacked USA nor WTC]. Bush also had warplans because the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan had taken power of Afghanistan around 1999.
/watch?v=_MRSr1MnFuk

Be specific, i&#39;ve brought allot of science as my reference. Be more specific on the science you want me to cite you to. But if you want a general view, research the cites on the website w w w . debunking911 . c o m
Believe what you wish kid C:
According to Americans, the building should fall at free fall speed into its own shape.
Here are several steel-framed skyscrapers that fell due to fire; /watch?v=_MRSr1MnFuk
I can site you to steel-framed sky scrapers from China, Singapore &amp; S.America that fell due to fire? 
None of the fires from your reference were burning with 20,000 gallons of jet fuel. 
No skyscraper on earth would hold in this situation. 
Also; the jetfuel did NOT burn in a fireball. Right before WTC1&amp;2 collapse, massive fires can be seen. The weight of WTC had allot to do with the fall. S.Tower was hit last but fell first because it was hit far lower meaning the steel frames had more weight.
I&#39;ve done my own experiments. If you have melted aluminum good for you, but try this; 
melt aluminum in an iron cup/bowl &amp; add in some paper, plastic &amp; glass. Notice that the color of the molten aluminum has completely changed. Not only were these other debris present in WTC inferno, but they were likely also present in the Boeing 767. 
ps; firemen are still not alloy experts &amp; even most alloy experts don&#39;t add these random additives to molten metals. 
Fact, In this history of the world No Skycraper has ever collapsed on itself from fire alone since building 7 9/11 
Criminal records, especially with cases concerning corruption, are kept electronically in Justice Department. 
Again; controlled demolitions fall on their footprint, WTC7 did not.
идеальная справедливость - poetic justice - ilahi adalet
All files of corruption in WTC7 were scanned &amp; on gov. websites, so toppling WTC7 wouldn&#39;t get rid of them. 
Professional demolitions fall on their own footprint. WTC7 obviously did not, research Barclay Street on 911.
I just bring facts. Research Barclay Street in 911.
You&#39;re wrong. 
Any heat causes air to expand &amp; the hotter, the more it expands. And any heat makes a metal weaker, the hotter the weaker it gets. 
WTC7 videos are all from far off, WTC7 fell on Barclay Street, demolitions fall on their footprints not outside its footprint like WTC7. 
Aluminum is the molten metal in WTC, firemen aren&#39;t experts on alloy, much less know the difference between molten steel &amp; molten aluminum. 
ps; your last video says that no 1 examined the molten metal [aluminum].
How is WTC7 a &#39;&#39;perfect job of demolition] when the building fell over Barclay street? Barclay street is NOT WTC7 footprint. That is in no way a &#39;&#39;perfect demolition&#39;&#39;. 
I&#39;ve cited you to the reports from true experts in the field, but since there are &#39;&#39;experts&#39;&#39; in both sides of the argument i have brought the science as my argument like &#39;&#39;heat causes air to expand and when enclosed, pressure builds until something gives [the window]&#39;&#39;. 
I bring  scientific explanation a child can understand.
There are photos of the structural damage in WTC7, search them in w w w . debunking911 . c o m 
The problem is that the fire smoke blew in WTC7 southern end, and this was also where the structural damage was done [WTC1&amp;2 started the fire AND the structural damage in WTC7 so obviously both t he fire &amp; damages are on southern end]. 
ps; fireproofing can be taken out by hand, so obviously a B-767 colliding to a building can take out fireproofing as well. 
No skyscraper was ever hit by a jet so big.

You are wrong. Jet fuel can&#39;t burn at so high temperatures.

Wikipedia:
Open air burning temperatures 	260–315 °C (500–599 °F)
Flash point 	51.1 °C (124.0 °F)
Autoignition temperature 	210 °C (410 °F)


Who talk like a person who must have serious emotional issues...
WTC1&amp;2 fell, causing massive column damage &amp; fires in WTC7, so it&#39;s obvious that WTC7 fell long after WTC1&amp;2. Their collapsed caused the damages in WTC7, meaning WTC7 falls after...not before....it&#39;s a simple concept. 
I saw your video, what proof do you have that there were explosives? Heat causes air to expand, &amp; if the air has no exit pressure builds until something gives [in that case the window]. This is simple science. Also, in height it intensifies. Shoot open a window in a plane, try it.
2/2 
WTC7 had massive structural damage as well, the 911 report clearly states WTC7 fell due to multiple structural damages, not just fire. 
ps; there were files of fraud in WTC7? So why not go in and burn it [the fire is a great excuse], having to topple the whole building doesn&#39;t make sense.
1/2 
Here&#39;s a test for you; 
Put a 5lbs bowling ball on your foot, notice it applies 5lbs of pressure, not much. Now put that bowling ball 7ft in the air [1 floor] and drop it on your foot. For a split second you will have over 50lbs of pressure on your foot [which will hurt]. That&#39;s because the bowling ball released kenetic energy. 
Every floor in WTC [like in any skyscraper] was built to withstand the weight above, but NOT that same weight falling 7ft [1 floor]. 

Jet fuel doesn&#39;t melt steel, but jet fuel heat can weaken steel and when you couple THIS to the weight of the WTC towers 1&amp;2 [the tallest skyscrapers in New York] the result is that steel bends. Here&#39;s a video that explains this phenomena far better than i do; /watch?v=bMZ-nkYr46w 
Now i need to stop watching alex jones? LOL
2/2 
3. Fire-proofing experts working in the site all clearly stated that jet collision can whipe our fireproofing. I&#39;ve taken our fireproofing myself &amp; without using tools [meaning with my hands]. 
4. Steel didn&#39;t melt in WTC on early 911. 
5. Air is VERY buoyant, meaning one can stand next to an inferno &amp; not be affected, BUT if you are above the inferno [heat rises] it&#39;s a whole different story. 
Questions?
1/2 
Pretty much everything you said is wrong, I&#39;ll correct you one step at a time; 
1. &#39;&#39; collapse neatly into its own footprint like the twin towers&#39;&#39; 
WTC1&amp;2 debris hit pretty much every building around including Bankers Trust which was over 100 feet away, that, sir, is not collapsing into its own building. WTC7 fell into Barclay Street, that, sir, i snot falling into its own footprint. 
2. I previously named several steel skyscrapers [not simply light buildings] that fell due to fire.
This is fake! The building isn&#39;t falling on top of its self like the world trade centers and building 7 over a small office fire!

FAKE FAKE FAKE 

EVERYONE KNOWS, Buildings fall on top of them selves when they are on fire! 
9/11 2001 proves that!
It&#39;s truly a divine miracle that, that building didn&#39;t collapse upon itself right down into its own footprint . Wow , Just ....wow !
I know, I have seen all that stuff thousands of times, I used to be a 9/11 truther...
lol someone was mad about all these skyscrapers getting constructed in Chechnya. Because we know Chechens are traditionally a people who live in clanstructures and don&#39;t want to be part of a Western style society. Besides, 40 metres next to the skyscrapers the people are hungry and cold so..what does it mean? It is supposed to mean power but only power by force in Chechnya.
Finally; 
let&#39;s say your conspiracy theory is true. What reason is there behind it? Why would the illuminati alien nibirus jews need to topple WTC7? No 1 died in WTC7 so there&#39;s no need for it to fall, none. Were there illuminati nibirus files in it? Wouldn&#39;t a simple fire destroyed the files in an evacuated building? 
No 1 died in WTC7 &amp; the nation was still angry enough to go to war. 
Steel is a flexible metal but when it is heated up [especially at extreme temperature of burning jetfuel] steel becomes weaker and far more flexible. 
Just because alex jones says WTC7 fell in free fall speed doesnt mean it&#39;s true. Do the science yourself, i gave you the formula. 

Far more people who are qualified &amp; worked in the site say that your experts &amp; you are wrong. Basing your arguments on what a small portion of architects say [yes 1,000 architects is a few compared to the rest] is a fallacy. 
Steel bends when buildings collapsed &amp; with heat [from burning jetfuel] they become weaker &amp; flexible. 
WTC7 didn&#39;t fall in free fall speed, do the formula yourself with the video as a reference. Just because alex jones says it&#39;s free fall doesnt mean it&#39;s true. 
google World Trade Center 7 (WTC7). It didn&#39;t get hit by the planes but it fell due to &quot;fire&quot;
HOW DID WORLD TRADE CENTER 7 FALL?

I am sure some people might be interested in watching this video.
Seems like he is working full time trying to spam this video with his comments. 
That&#39;s not true. Most of demolition experts and architects can tell it makes no sense how these buildings came down.

I don&#39;t point out alex jones but engineers, demolition experts and architects who say that the official story doesn&#39;t make any sense.

Truth will come out eventually.

You can&#39;t hide the truth

911 - Danny Jowenko on WTC7 controlled demolition
/watch?v=zu8d5f9O6K0 



that bastard saddam has attacked another building right get the troops 
together were going to iran 
Over 10,000 engineers &amp; demolition experts say the official story is right, so who do you believe? 
No building on earth is made to handle a WTC falling on them taking out its columns. All WTC received heavy damage but WTC7 received the most from WTC1&amp;2 fall. 
If you want to believe alex jones &amp; not do the science yourself.....have fun and good luck in life.
well for one, it didn&#39;t have a Boeing 757 crash into it at 500 mph...
It did, no matter how much you are trying to convince people of the contrary. WTC7 came down in free fall speed. 
People more qualified than you say the official story is not true. You are just a troll, mixing facts. Which makes me thing that either you work for someone to spam this channel or you must be a totally brainwashed trying to convince people that WTC came down just due to fires.

These buildings were built so sustain such damage. Anyone who is informed can know that.
You are just spamming this channel with misleading comments.

Truth will come out eventually.

Yeah, you know more than the nearly 2000 engineers and architects who say the official story is not true.

Who pays you to spam this video with that crap?.
hey!, who pays you to tell so many lies???
Liar.
Building 7 springs to mind. 
almost 2000 architects and engineers who stand for 911 truth with 25 000 years of experience among them are retards and you are the genius? google architects and engineers for 911 truth. There are many thousands of other couragous professionals who have stood up for 911 truth, do your research, idiot.
free fall is when something falls no resistance. isnt it self explanatory?
&quot;Major columnar damage&quot; not sustained on the Marriott Hotel, WTC4, WTC5, or WTC6, which were all MUCH closer to BOTH of the twin towers than WTC7 was to either, yet they sustained NEGLIGIBLE damage by comparison to WTC7.  Simply find an aerial view of the area and this should be readily obvious.
strange how this one didn&#39;t fall to the ground at free-fall speed 9/11 was a lie. 
I guess they R ~ 2 what ~ I have no idea :) 
Feel free 2 enlighten Us/Me further :) 
Awww ~ Ur not the heathen U claimed R I hoped not so :) 
I was sure to find trolls/paid shills about 911 in this video
Thats a Conspiracy  Theory!! High Rises on fire collapse at free fall speed! the gov said so! that&#39;s why they sent Halliburton to Irak to find WMD&#39;s! but they couldn&#39;t find em so they built an Oil pipeline while they were looking for Bin Laden around it! so they also had to build 3 Military bases to protect the spontaneous endeavor!.. you see it really was all about &quot;Spreading Democracy &amp; Freedom&quot;.......................... the world is relentlessly going to shit....
Molten aluminum was caused by burning jetfuel. There are videos of aluminum melting with even gasoline fires. 
There were iron ores in WTC, but these were formed as a result of the risque mission where iron bars were melted through with oxyacetylene torches. 
There were also all sorts of chemicals in the air, some even found in explosives, thermite and chemical weapons. No need for a conspiracy! The fact is computers, generators &amp; a/c use some of these elements, &amp; WTC obviously had all. 
Doubts?
I&#39;ll correct everything you said wrong 1 by 1; 
1. WTC has had terrorism covered insurance from as early as 1990, in the 1993 bombing they won $580 millions in insurance [i bet Alex Jones didn&#39;t mention this]. 
2. No plane in 911 completely vaporized, engines &amp; landing gear were recovered, but you don&#39;t believe jets can vaporize? What&#39;s this; /watch?v=25vlt7swhCM 
ps; F4 is far more solid than any Boeing passenger jet. 
3. This is what Silverstein really said; /watch?v=urokCZyTeBQ 
Questions?
why isnt it free falling? i thought all buildings did after 9/11
Fire actually does produce molten steel in furnaces, but not in WTC. 
I did watch the videos, their crap. They rely on fireman saying &#39;&#39;we saw molten steel&#39;&#39;, but do you truly think a fireman knows the difference between molten steel &amp; molten aluminum [which did melt in WTC]? 
The aluminum fused into steel had more to do with liquid aluminum sticking to the steel, rather than vice-versa. 
Take of your tinfoil hat for a second &amp; rationalize. illuminati/alien/nibirus wont mind LOL
Tens of thousands of &#39;&#39;demolition &amp; architect experts&#39;&#39; agree &amp; disagree on both sides of the lake. Only sheeple use that as a basis of their argument. 
I advise you search the science yourself &amp; rationalize. 
Obviously both WTC began falling at the point right above the plane crash sites. Do you really think explosives were placed right above the site where both planes crashed? Do you really think explosives wouldn&#39;t go off until an hour of jetfuel burning right on them? 
Rationalize kid.
Your videos lack science. Aside from having way out there theories [like drones, i saw in 1 of the video the author spoke of illuminati], they also lack science. 
Most notably the video talking about molten steel. Just because firefighters saw dripping metal &amp; said it was steel doesn&#39;t mean it was steel. They interviewed no expert on alloy. 
There was melted aluminum [mixed with crap in the building] which any1 who isn&#39;t an expert could confuse. 
The videos show phony non-scientific evidence.
Ya it feel from explosions forsure
Actually, most rational people know the truth like me. Supposedly i was alone for not wanting Ron Paul to win the elections LOL but on youtube with conspiracy theorist i&#39;m always alone c:
Crazy that it didn&#39;t collapse Like building 7 lol
Your video is absurd, it suggest WTC7 fell in free fall speed. It did not. Do the calculations yourself. Use the formula of gravity 9.8 m/s^2, use the height of WTC7 &amp; with this you can easily calculate how fast freefall speed is with that height. Now compare that time with a video of WTC7 fall. It didn&#39;t fall close to that speed. 
Do the science yourself, don&#39;t let men like Alex Jones brainwash you. Also; over 50 demolition &amp; architect experts worked on 911 site, they have a different story C:
So sad to see a nice building be wasted.
I&#39;d not wanna ride on the same bus with you ... 
I am not saying that there was no bombs planted in 9/11 twins, but I do want to point out that buildings in Russia are built with concrete. 
Simcity. you need more fire stations plopped near it. &gt;&lt; 
has it collapsed yet?
You are alone with your lies.
Yes 1600 engineers and architects say WTC buildings were demolished.
Are you an architect?. Who pays you to tell so many lies?.
Totally brainwashed.
Fire don&#39;t bring down buildings you idiot.
So are you now an expert to know how many tons of thermite are needed to bring down those buildings?.
You are no one.
Hehe :) 
Is Grozny ever NOT burning? Guessing it was arson? Seems like a tough neighbourhood.
Hey Shlomo, building 7 wasn&#39;t hit any aircraft.
Hello Mordechai
lol look at the video the day after. Its a literal towering inferno... its still up tho
I&#39;m guessing that building on the right will fall down out of sympathy
I see you&#39;re still working this page. Is this your weekly assignment?
dang that looks like a much bigger fire than the WTCs experienced!  it&#39;s bound to collapse at any minute now.
You and trvth1s should hold hands and sing &quot;we&#39;re a bunch of morons&quot;
Just because you posted your stupid comment up here doesn&#39;t mean it means squat!
You would have needed 60 tons of thermite to drop one of those towers. It&#39;s ridiculous to think all of the 60 tons were placed without anyone noticing it. It&#39;s also absurd that 2 jets crashed at the same exact spot the buildings began to drop which would mean jetfuel fired burned right above thermite for an hour without igniting it LOL 
Just because alex jones says that structural engineers say something doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true.
Translation: &quot;I can&#39;t, so I won&#39;t. Instead, I will make lame excuses while continuing to push these ridiculous theories without a shred of proof&quot;
Wow, I can&#39;t believe the Czechs have the guts to ignore basic laws of nature like that.
Everybody knows that when a building is on fire it will collapse completely straight into its own footprint, just look at Building 7. 

Damn you Czechs, you made Isaac Newton turn in his grave.
well they were not crashed by airplanes.
这个是哪里？是不是里面都有人跳下来了！
Larry obviously didn&#39;t get the memo to &quot;pull&quot; it.
You haven&#39;t read a single word I said in my previous comment, typical! There is no point in discussing things with you when you are just going to completely ignore everything I say!
Have fun living in a pretend world, goodbye.
3 buildings bro 3
every single building in history managed to do that except for them damn weaklings in 2001.
it was empty
РАмзан: эй, путин пришли еще пару миллиардов дотаций, а не то в горы опять побежим!
Are they filming another sequel to Die Hard in Russia?
Lead is not only heavier than steel, it&#39;s much more DENSE(almost twice), thus when being fired at the mach 1+ it doesn&#39;t &quot;cut&quot; steel plates, it penetrates it at a single point where all that force, weight and speed is concentrated, that&#39;s why points entry holes are TINY.

A HALLOW passenger jet airplane does not weight, density or speed to cut steel!
this is a fake, if not then shouldn&#39;t the building collapsed?... russian...
Why didn&#39;t it kink and middle and collapse into its footprint at free fall speeds?
.40 what does this guy on the right with the hose think he&#39;s doing?
The Fuck ?

Деньги наверно закончились, щас выделят на ремонт будет что попилить.
Brace yourself! WTC 7 conspiracy theory are coming
Probably Depardieu forgot to switch off the iron
/watch i don&#39;t care
and then in a few seconds the whole thing turned to dust...

What? It didn&#39;t?
It wasn&#39;t built by &quot;Americans&quot;!
Gulf of Tonkin incident was admitted False Flag operation to get USA into war with Vietnam. H.Kissinger admits it now even publicly and over 50k U.S soldiers died in Vietnam with 3-5 million Vietnamese people mostly civilians.
Conspiracy theories are for idiots.

Name one that has been proven.
kinda reminds me of building 7, just like building 7, this building survived! see proof! excpet building 7 disappeared and went to another dimension for a few years, but its all good, its back now....no conspiracy here..... fires do that
The laws of physics in Russia are different from those in th US ( same as everywhere else in the world).
WTC7 had the most column damage, it also had major fires unlike the rest of the WTC. The fires spread which made them major. 
WTC7 collapse didn&#39;t cause any deaths, WTC1&amp;2 were much larger thus their collapse caused far more dust which caused the deaths years later, not WTC7. WTC7 killed no 1 so i don&#39;t see what the big deal is. WTC7 didn&#39;t have to collapse for a conspiracy illuminati alien war to start.
A jew didn&#39;t decide to &quot;pull it&quot; to collect insurance on this building.
Column damage from thermite. All structural engineers looked at the evidence and know it was a thermite demolition. Sorry you believe in politiicians instead of science.
why hasnt the building fallen into dust?
how come this building didnt fall like the twin tower&gt;
Correction....the Bush administration needed someone to blame to invade Afghanistan for opium poppies so more oxycontin and heroin could be on the market than ever before.....he strictly invaded Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction, the chemical weapons the Reagan administration sold to Saddam for the Iran-Iraq war.
Actually what it taught us is that building built in 2011 took lessons from the WTC collapse of buildings that were built in the 70s.
b..ut.. it&#39;s not burning with jet fuel!!........
If 911 taught us anything, it&#39;s that we should have expected this to collapse into its footprint by now from fire damage.  (WTC7)  /endsarcasm
Why are people watching and not running. The whole tower is going to collapse neatly into its footprint. If this hasn&#39;t happened by now, then of course the Russian&#39;s obviously are much better building high rise buildings than we are in the west. 
Yep, even though this is by far not the first time in history that the government would have done something like this.
WTC7 should NOT have collapsed! That&#39;s my point. The whole scenario with WTC7 does not make any sense!
Have you looked at pictures of WTC4, 5, and 6?! They had not just &quot;major ceiling damage&quot; but also huge gaping holes in them all the way to the ground! Half of support structures were completely destroyed and yet they still stood. WTC7 had much less damage!
WTC7 did NOT have &quot;major fires&quot;, it had uncontrolled fires and only on 6 floors (7,8,9 and 11, 12, 13), which then spread.
People didn&#39;t die in the building, but they did die in the years that followed from the consequences of those collapses!
You should take your own advice 
Look at the comment on the video. 
You got trolled. 
Do research using primary sources, not videos posted by random conspiracy theorist like Alex Jones.
A man with a electrical tape and few cigarette lighters from Afganistan flew in a paracute into the buidling and used his duct tape to seal all windows and set the building on fire with lighters.... the buidling will soon pancake and fall on its own footprint.. and ofcouse due to intense heat and structural damage it will get pulvurised.... if nothing happens then its a FAKE video... or RT is a paid news channel or 911 was an Inside Job done by Mossad and CIA... readers can make their own choice
WTC7 had major column damage, not just fires. Research photos of WTC7 on southern end. Firefighters state it was missing 1/3 of its columns thanks to WTC2 debris [which also damaged other buildings but WTC7 got most of the damage due to angle]. 
Take off the tin foil hat &amp; think about this for a moment C:
Other buildings around had major sealing damage but none had as much column damage as WTC7, also, none had a major fire like WTC7. 
Have you ever cut a tree down? You cut 1 side &amp; it falls on the other end. Same principle, you can test this on not only trees but homes and skyscrapers. 
All WTC had major damage but 1 had to give, it was WTC7. 
No one died in WTC7 so i dont see what the big deal is.
its more than 48 hrs now in Islamic Chechnya nation,  is the building fallen down yet.
Actually, WTC1&amp;2 also fell. The other WTC had major sealing damage &amp; WTC7 had major column damage along with a fire.
It should collapse in exactly 3, 2, 1 ........ Oh wait, somebody has to say &quot;Pull It!&quot; first.
In Soviet Russia Smores cook you!
@kunggi1
Why u blame on muslim? This all because israel, especially 911.
Then to push them over the edge play the Danny Jowenko clip.
WTC Building Number 7 (the third building to fall on that day) was showing no signs of fire from the outside when it fell into its own footprint on 9-11.  This building in Russia is fully engulfed and appears to be still standing.  When I lived in Madrid the Windsor Tower caught ablaze (I think it was 35 stories).  The next day I walked to the site and saw how the skeleton was still standing.  Somehow only 9-11 is the day that buildings made of steel began to defy the laws of physics.  Yup.
OMG fire! One of the columns was surely weakend! The building is about to collapse into its own footprint! NIST told me, it must be true!
Smores, anyone?
be carefull that thing could fall into a pile of dust 
So did a few other surrounding buildings. They had even larger damages to their structure but still remained standing!
WTC7 had fires on only 6 or so floors, and they it took hours for them to spread from one end of the building to another. Besides WTC7 was damaged on one side but the collapse of it began on the completely opposite side!
f-yeah man!  Couldn&#39;t have said it better myself.  Your sarcasm is wonderful.  Love it.
Ahhhh for now on demolition companies will demo buildings using just fire. You see, you just solve the mystery. 
Typical physical properties for Jet A / Jet A-1 fuel

- Open air burning temperatures 	260–315 °C (500–599 °F)
Fires can&#39;t bring down the WTC7. You are just trying to mislead people. There were just a few fires nothing compare we can see on this video.
You are just a crazy person trying to convince us that 2+2 = 6.
Get a doctor you need it.
It was brought down by explosives. Do your homework you are totally ignorant about the real facts.

But I guess there is always a psychopath like you trying to convince us that fire can bring down WTC7.
You are CRAZY
Do your homework. 
Research photos of WTC7 southern end before collapsed. See how half of the buildings bottom is missing? That&#39;s column damage from WTC2 fall out. 
Also; research photos of WTC7 after collapse. See where the debris are? Now research Barclay Street. See where the street is/was? Why is WTC7 fall over it? LOL
i was gonna make a witty comment about 9/11 but its already been done :)
You are wrong
Brainwashed.
WTC7 fire wasn&#39;t small, also, the building had massive column damage from WTC2 debris. Maybe if the tallest building in New York fell on this building &amp; took out its column, it would fall. Still, it wont fall on its footprint. WTC7 fell over Barclay Street. Barclay Street was never WTC7 footprint.
It didn&#39;t just have office fire. WTC7 had massive column damage from WTC2 debris.
building 7 didn&#39;t have &quot;a full size jumbo jet flown right in the middle of it&quot; either, yet it collapses to dust, straight down on itself.  
hahahaha.....
notice how it didn&#39;t collapse inwards  
is there a gas line that goes up the building? how does concrete catch fire?
you are to stupuid to insult
i was waiting for it to fall perfectly into its own footprint at freefall speed. i guess that only happens here. i always wondered why they pay companys to demo buildings with explosives when you really only have to start a few small fires around the building and it will come down perfect as if you spent hundreds of thousands rigging it to come down with a controlled demolition.  
Most of the jet fuel burned up right after the plane hit. Even NIST stated that. So try again. 
POOR MORE VODKA ON IT!!!
and Thanks to you as well.
You would think that it&#39;s obvious the twin towers fell because of fire, lol, they would tell people to evac the area, but i&#39;m sure it&#39;s prob because they want to give people the freedom to stay or not, lol.
Beautifully stated  Thank you  =)
Jet  fuel is  almost 100% kerosene.. Kerosene  =LOW HEAT... DUH!
Building 7 what??? 
None of those obvious facts matter. The only thing that matters is what the TV tells us.
I expected 9/11, WTC7 references and arguments the moment I saw this.
Hey. A very special Thank You to the new shill troll disinfo types. Thanks to this video I was able to add a couple new ones to the list of complicit traitors in mass murder, war crimes &amp; crimes against humanity.
A tip for other viewers. If confronted by a shill troll, simply ask them to produce the basic high school equations for Newton&#39;s Third Law in relation to planes hitting the buildings &amp; for the Law of the Conservation of Momentum in relation to the buildings collapsing. Watch them Dance
And of course the fuel makes no difference since WTC7 could fall in exactly the same way without any jet fuel contributing to the fires. And whatever registered on the seismograph happened immediately before the first collapse. You need to do your research before you post on here. Of course anyone who believes the official story has spent little if any time researching the circumstances surrounding that day and mainly just to study debunker fallacy arguments. 
No it is not. You either lie or are misinformed. A blue flame on a gas stove is hotter than a red flame. Burning Jet Fuel Does Nothing To My Tiny Thin Steel Dog Tags. 
Anyone that thinks Kerosene with extra oxygen can melt steel knows nothing of Rocket Fuel (LoL) or that They can buy a Kerosene Industrial Heater made of thin steel at a Good Hardware Store. Oh &amp; I haven&#39;t even started on asking you about the kids science that proves you &amp; the event of 911 wrong.
Not until trolls like you produce the high school physics equations instead of endless bullshit arguments &amp; cheap talk. For 6 yrs I have asked shill trolls to show me the less than high school physics equations a child could do &amp; then watch them flip out, dancing in every direction, offering distractions, running thru the published disinformation tactics list &amp; back again, but no matter what, none of them can produce the answers. They can&#39;t because it proves the crime &amp; makes them complicit.
It wouldn&#39;t. Of the sparse example of other incidents where an aircraft collided with a building, none collapsed which further validates alternative 9/11 narratives. I guess you&#39;re pretty obsessed with the 20,000 tons of jet fuel, but yes, it had burned off by the time the towers collapsed.
fake! it didn&#39;t collapse
in russias gruzney?
fuck off ruassia it is Chechnya not the alcoholic state of russia.
invaders out of Chechnya
if there were computers in the hotel, that had government documents of proof of fraud and of missing billions of dollars in tax payer money, that would surely collapse it.
Asalaam alaikum.  Dude, you got any marshmallows?

Sure a plane hit, did it do any real damage outside of a fireball? Nope.
A hollow plane made of Aluminum, Fiberglass and plywood does not have the density to chop through a steel beam even at high speeds, simply doesn&#39;t happen.

I see you like BMW&#39;s I bet you believe a BMW will plow right throw a concrete highway barricade don&#39;t you? LOL I love you youtube guys, you really crack me up.
Haven&#39;t you people already burned out all your arguments enough over the past 11 years?
Don&#39;t you have something better to do?
not at all emulating someone is to show great love ane respect for all that person was about and has done. Muslims follows the teachings of the authenic Messagers and prophets peace be on all of them. That&#39;s not a cult its the truth.
Building 7 fell as well, and it wasn&#39;t damaged by a plane - just office fires. Same demolition style fall. 
why the hell it burns? asteroid impact?
banyak sangat orang berzina dalam tu, tu sebab terbakar
Hmm it din&#39;t collapse like WTC1-2 AND 7? 

OH THAT&#39;S RIGHT IT WASN&#39;T CONTROLLED DEMOLISHED LIKE THE BUILDINGS ON 9-11.

spread the word: watch?v=uh7RCVJ8ako
Who do you work for traitor?
Forgot to pay the mortgage... 

No molten metal?
How come this building never collapsed in on it itself but yet the twin towers which were built to sustain a direct hit by a passenger plane collapsed so easily and quickly and what about building 7 which had even less fires this building! People who still do not believe 911 was an inside job perpetrated by the Zionist bankers are just blind sheep!
See. What I tell ya. I didn&#39;t blow WTC 9/11. SHDW GVMNT did it.
0:36 nokia tune got murdered
Good luck in the fight against &quot;Common Sense&quot;, little Zionist government propaganda troll, lmao.

9/11 Inside Job /Rothschild Mossad, FBI, CIA, NSA,... ^^
let&#39;s continue this discussion on the next RT video 
/watch?v=mQ1P2K1j-gQ
the building is now completely engulfed in flame
Have you ever smelted steel before? steel burns at about 2600 degrees and jet fuel even with accelerants like carpet or office furniture CANNOT burn anywhere near the point of melting steel of any grade. if you want proof go pour Kerosene on a piece of steel and see if it melts into a pile of dust in 45 minutes.
You 9/11 nut jobs are sad. Totally different construction,but you show your stupidity with your comments!
you know that terrorism is an ideology and a tactic right? to fight it means a never ending war.
have you read the talmud?
This building wasn&#39;t built in 1973 made from cheap grade steel and concrete. It also didn&#39;t have a full size jumbo jet flown right through the middle of it.
you think it was Muslim trying to assassinate your war criminal puppet.  i hate sheep&#39;s.     

Nazi Germany warmongers.  give Jews there land back sheep&#39;s.
I guess russian skyscrapers dont break down so easily... I mean fire does collapse buildings, no?
omfg the buildings still stand up.  what a shocker.  all the people was saved in 24 hours.

if this was fake empires, they wouldn&#39;t save the innocent people because all they care about is profits for the elites.
According to the 9/11 commission, This burning tower is due to collapse into dust any minute now.
thats how you show the news cbc and cnn.
nope but thats about the level of they are capable of and India didnt have anything to gain and didnt subsequently use it to reduce freedoms and start wars. Indian govt wasnt calling for it as US govt was in PNAC...you know PNAC right? Preoject for the new American century
Yes i can name a couple buildings, here this video names just a few; /watch?v=_MRSr1MnFuk 
Now it&#39;s your turn; can you name me a skyscraper that has been hit by a B-767 with over 20,000 gallons of fuel &amp; has not fallen?
Bali, Bombay, Madrid, Belgium, Toulouse, Djerba..., nohing? Islamic terrorists attacked thousands of times since 9/11! Only two weeks ago they made an attempt to assassinate a politician here in Germany!  It really happens all the time... 
can you name a building that has been brought down with thermite? I can
can you name a building that has been brought down with fire?
what makes you think im american?
NIST gave plenty of models with mathematical formulas of weight, steel bars &amp; the effect of jetfuel heat. 
You can&#39;t have a live test of something as big &amp; atrocious as 911. 
The science is there, and conspiracies are not. Unless you think 60 tons of thermite were placed right above both jet crash floors. That is if it were thermite [which doesn&#39;t make an explosion noise, it makes more of a hissing noise].
/watch?v=ecv0p8JWsqU 
At 4:30 the last tower began collapsing but at around 4:43 you can see the top of the tower tilting
Mda!
Those terrorist actually had plenty of terrorist attempts before hand. This was not the first attack on WTC by terrorist. 
We are in war with terrorism, meaning we took the fight to them. They have done plenty of terrorist attacks in the middle east since. This is the war. They have successfully had some attacks in Europe but thankfully not here. The war is there now, not here.
We don&#39;t need no water let the mother......
Oh my god you are too funny. Ok lets say that the official story is 100% true for a minute. Arabs attacked because of America&#39;s freedom...and the governments response was to reduce freedom (Patriot Act etc) talk about encouraging terrorists.
You dont find it a little strange that these boogeyman terrorists managed to pull off the most audacious act of terrorism but havent been able to do anything since... nothing...even to set off lil a grenade since? 
Have you ever turned on any fuel? Get some gas, diesel or jetfuel if you can. Put it on fire. They do have an initial fireball [except diesel] but in no way do they burn out in this initial fireball, especially if we&#39;re talking about 20,000 gallons of jetfuel.
No sir, it was hit by WTC2 debris.
one thing you have to know when there is a fire with fuel is that the inicial fire ball consumes the entire fuel! there is no burning for an hour in that case 
You are the conspiracy theorist my friend. You believe 19 Arabs conspired to bring down the WTC Here is your precious conspiracy theory that you cling to
/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98
loool your mother is a genious lool 
The buildings obviously began collapsing at the floor above both jet crash sites, look at videos of both towers close-up. The buildings crunch on themselves at that exact spot. Is it coincidence or do you truly think thermite was placed ironically right above both crash sites withstanding jetfuel fire for 1 hour? 
Aerial video of WTC1 collapsed does show the tower slow down to a near stop when it&#39;s almost at the bottom.
the truth movement was founded largely by victims families so not sure where youre going with the respect thing. What will I see in the full video? The building collapsing in a different way?
And it did not collapse ? how come? 9/11 showed that buildings collapse if they have small fire. 
&quot;not to say every fire will collapse a building&quot; No not to say that...never in fact. Unless you care to furnish me some examples other than 911
No skyscraper that tall or a bit shorter on earth can withstand a B767 crashing with 20,000 gallons of jetfuel at full speed.
WTC7 fell tilted sideways north-north-east over Barclay Street. 

and a﻿ major difference between an architect and you
and a major difference between an architect and you
and according to NIST it was &quot;just a fucking fire&quot; that brought down the 3 WTC buildings
yes you have just restated what I said before about WTC1 i.e. gravity does not cause lateral ejections. However I was in fact talking about wtc7. Watch it go down. watch the left and right perpendiculars and notice they dont change as the building goes down
yes you will see a wavefront preceded by multiple squibs ejecting all around the building. You will see white incendiary smoke at the base and impact point. You will see explosive damage in the basement and ground floor. You will see firefighters describing molten lava and pop pop pop as each floor gets taken out. You will hear the explosions. MSM never show these parts
911 - Russia.
Finally; 
You&#39;re quoting a lawyer, not an engineer/demolition expert working the site. 
NASA satellites caught fire burning at jet fuel temperature in the ground after WTC collapse. The fire was still burning, some even during cleanup.
the official story says fire dropped the WTC not the impact. WTC had endured wind sheer forces in excess of the collision in the past as thats what it was designed to do. It was designed to withstand &quot;multiple airplane impacts&quot; in the words of the lead engineer on the project. Apparently fire brought it down. Even though WTC had caught fire in the 70&#39;s and burned longer and over a wider area than 911 it didnt collapse
Symmetrical collapse in WTC? Where? 
Lets examine; WTC1 west wall debris went as far as hitting Bankers Trust but its southern wall debris didn&#39;t even get past WTC3. Here&#39;s a chart; h t t p ://debunking911. c o m /pull. h t m 
Scroll down to the second image. 
The collapse trajectory of both buildings 4 walls are nos symmetrical, and in fact tower 2 leaned almost completely eastward during collapse 3/4ths way down.
btw...nice architecture, i like how the skyscraper on the right relate to the mosque. Its quite good.
you still havent addressed the NASA satellite thermal imagery. Remember what the 911 commission members said about the investigation &quot;set up to fail&quot; &quot;cover up&quot; &quot;dishonest&quot; &quot;wildly different to what the public is told&quot; over half the members werent happy with the final report
you said that ONLY demolition experts can be listened to on this subject. I doubt there are 1000&#39;s of demo experts in the whole world let alone 1000&#39;s that would support universal, symmetrical collapse from office fires
thousands of experts say X thing happens, Danny says Y thing happened, and your only argument is what Danny sayd? 
Notice i didn&#39;t say what thousands of experts said, that&#39;snot my argument, my argument is mathematics, formulas, rational, etc.
Here are photos of WTC7 damage from WTC2 debris; h t t p ://debunking911. c o m /pull. h t m 
Just because your source doesn&#39;t have some photos doesn&#39;t mean those photos don&#39;t exist. 
Cheers.
&quot;1 mans opinion [Danny Jowenko] doesn&#39;t invalidate other expert opinions. &quot;

Thats why we&#39;re not letting you invalidate us lol


Those drills weren&#39;t teaching people to fly planes into buildings. They were drills where pilots and other soldiers practiced situations of terrorism. Just because a pilot said &#39;&#39;this must be part of the excersize&#39;&#39; doesn&#39;t mean it was [and it wasn&#39;t]. It also doesn&#39;t mean that they had previously trained in a situation like that. 
1 mans opinion [Danny Jowenko] doesn&#39;t invalidate other expert opinions. 
&quot;an architect knows how to build but not how things are destroyed [demolition specialist&quot;

Ok i say again....Danny Jowenko
so you still believe &quot;nobody could imagine people flying planes into buildings&quot; as said by bush and condi rice WHILE THEY WERE CARRYING OUT THE EXACT SAME DRILL?
9/11 = 100% Inside Job
Your mother has been an architect for over 40 years? Well; an architect knows how to build but not how things are destroyed [demolition specialist]. 
&amp; 40 years as an architect i guess she&#39;s 60 years old at least, watching a video that&#39;s far away &amp; with low resolution doesn&#39;t make one an expert. 
You can time WTC7 fall with the simple formula of free fall speed applied to WTC7 height and see how the math adds up. Previously i posted the formula. 
BTW WTF7 fell on Barclay street.
What does this fire tell me?  New York needs  upgrade it&#39;s Building and Fire Safety Codes so their steel and concrete buildings won&#39;t turn to dust and melt.

Actually,  the people of New York should sue the city for having to work in such poorly made buildings...
NASA actually captured images of jetfuel fires after the building had collapsed. 
Also; most of the jetfuel was burning inside the building. Only the heavy hard parts of the jet flung out completely [engine, landing gear, etc]. 
2/2 
Finally; 
WTC1&amp;2 did have resistance. In fact, WTC2 stayed in the airfor about 1 second 3 quarters of the way down, then it continued to collapse after a tilt. Search for an aerial view of WTC2 collapse to see the building standing still 3 quarters of the way down [aerial view due to the smoke blocking it]. 

I hope everyone got out okay.:/
1/2 
There was a study on the demolition theory. Do you know you would have needed over 60 tons of thermite to drop the WTC towers? Aside from me asking how one could move all of this inside without any employees noticing, another interesting fact is that the jets obviously crashed on the building, jetfuel burned for almost an hour on the standing building yet it took so long for the &#39;&#39;thermite&#39;&#39; or explosives to go off. Undeniably WTC1&amp;2 began falling a floor above the jet impact floors.
My mother has been an architect for over 40 years. She has nothing to do with conspiracy theories but when i showed her wtc7 go down she just froze...motionless....speechless. I played it again...after a minute she said &quot;and this hasnt been speeded up? Thats the speed it came down?&quot;  she then knew instantly that the official story was a lie
You&#39;re talking about annual drills. 
No jetfighter in USA was prepared to drop passenger planes. This didn&#39;t happen in our history or in history in general.
WOW!!!  All these scientific numbers you keep belting out,  7 feet X 5lbs + 50lbs sq/in x = 20,000 gallons of jet fuel doesn&#39;t add up to 2.3 Trillion Dollars missing from the pentagon budget just the day before along with Millions of FCC records and documents on the biggest insider trading scam in world history. 

One has to keep in mind that America ranks very low in Math compared to other nations.
i think you mean put the majority of 20000 gallons of jet fuel just outside this building and little bit inside which burned off completely within 5 mins at a temperature 1/3 of what the NASA satellite thermal images picked up under WTC many days later. Was this magical jet fuel that keeps getter hotter for days after it has burned away?
This is the official NIST conspiracy theory explained very briefly 
/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98
this is the 1st time RT has mentioned Russia in a long time
that&#39;s exactly what I did...you on the other hand have fallen for the biggest conspiracy of them all
As 911 was happening in the real world there was a drill taking place involving hijacked planes being crashed into New York. This is one reason no fighters intercepted the planes because they &quot;chased a lot of phantoms that day&quot; It was called Operation Able Danger and there was also Operation Vigilant Guardian. I watch house and senate hearings to hear things right from the horses mouth

Put 20,000 gallons of jetfuel inside this skyscraper &amp; lets see if it doesn&#39;t fall C:
Gori gori jasno chtobi ne pogaslo!

WTC didn&#39;t fall symmetrically. WTC1 launched debris to frekin Bankers Trust which was in another street! 
WTC7 fell over Barclay Street! 
Boeing 767 was the biggest mass produced airliner of its time &amp; it was built in 81, several decades after WTC was built &#39;&#39;plane proof&#39;&#39;. WTC wasn&#39;t built to hold with 20,000 gallons of jetfuel burning, if so please cite me to proof and dont cite me to Alex Jones.
Russians build their skyscrapers out of Titanium.
&quot;...because fire was too intense...&quot; 
It&#39;s all about how WTC was built. It had steel bars in its outer layer. When 1 floor fell, the whole weight above fell for about 7 feet [a floor] and hit the floor under it. This is allot of force. Put a 5lbs bowling ball on your foot, notice 5 lbs sq/in doesnt hurt, but drop the bowling ball from 7ft on your foot. You will have over 50lbs sq/in on your foot for a moment, that hurts. That&#39;s caused the domino effect. Each floor fell over the other with extreme force pealing the outerbars.
Everyones an expert nowadays. I advice you make up your own mind based on science, not on what some conspiracy theorist say.
The burning of a fuel depends on its exposure to oxygen, spill a cup of jetfuel on the floor, and keep another cup of jetfuel in the cup. Burn both &amp; notice how long the jetfuel in the cup takes to burn out. 20,000 gallons of jetfuel take hours to burn, it was in fact still burning after the collapse. 
Jetfuel has enough energy to weaken steel rods &amp; beams which can give depending on weight. 
The whole building is holding the weight but it varies due to altitude. 
Physics01 
/watch?v=bMZ-nkYr46w
These buildings were designed to stand the impact of such big airplanes including its fuel.
No building can symmetrically collapse at almost freefall due to fire
These buildings were designed to stand 20,000 gallons of jetfuel you ignorant brainwashed.
911 was not an inside job thumbs up if you agree
911 was an inside job thumbs up if you agree
Ahh so from now on we will bring down buildings using just fire. 
WTC1 didnt fall in its own footprint, that is correct. However how does your gravity theory explain LATERAL ejections powerful enough to launch sections weighing many tons with enough force to impale buildings close by?

That building didn&#39;t collapse due to fire because physics of law and gravity itself works differently in Russia and the rest of the world except the US.

Please show me any proof, ANY that WTC1&amp;2 were built to withstand the impact of a Boeing 767 with 20,000 gallons of jetfuel. 
And before you answer i suggest you investigate the jets flying when WTC were built. No mass-produced jet on earth was as big as a B-767
And you are noone...
&quot;A youtube video doesn&#39;t make you an expert on demolition.&quot;
so why are you claiming to be an expert.
Now Danny Jowenko and Engineers for 911 truth are experts...listen to them 
Jetfuel burned out almost immediately, fuel does not have enough energy to bring down an entire building. 
The structure below the impact point was holding the wait of the building, There is no way the structure above the impact zone could collapse and demolish the rest of the building, because physics don&#39;t work that way.
 
Gravity has ONE direction
v
v
v
v
DOWN
So when 2 ton outerwalls go &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LATERALLY. Something OTHER THAN GRAVITY is at work.  Debunkers say it themselves. WTC DID NOT fall into its own footprint. Because it was BLOWN UP. If it wasnt for the buildings in the way, who knows how far the debris would have blown out to. Gravity....HAS ONE DIRECTION. 

And thats all I have to say about that =/
These buildings were built to stand the impact of such big airplanes. 
You have no clue what you are talking about. No building can collapse the WTC did with almost no resistance when the entire structure is below untouched.
Many things exploded in 911, including generators [from jetfuel fire], electrical explosions, etc.
WTC1&amp;2 fell with plenty of resistance, in fact WTC2 fell 3 quarters down, stood in the air for a second, tilted &amp; then continued to fall. 
WTC1&amp;2 didnt fall symmetrically, just research its debris. Bankers Trust was pulverized by it! 
No building on earth is built to withstand an impact from a jet with 20,000 gallons of jetfuel in it. 
Fire, especially jetfuel fire, weakens any metal. ANY
Any moment now this building will powderize and collapse in its own footprint just like the Trade Center on 9-11.
Wait for it....
Wait for it...
You sir have no idea what you are talking about. Destabilizing its foundations?. Are you serious?. 
a 747??? 
Go to hell traitor. 
Another one... Did you really just compare that with an aircraft that weights more than a dozen tons and travels at nearly its top speed during collision? I wonder how many more experimental labs I will receive from there RT youtube morons lmao...
Did this building collapse?
I&#39;ll show you a video of fireman on the scene saying there were explosions and pop pop pop floor by floor if you like
Nope you are asleep.
That&#39;s misleading garbage. You can&#39;t build up momentum with no resistance at all.
These buildings were demolished. 
No building can collapse in the way WTC1 and 2 did with almost no resistance. and symmetrically.
These buildings were built to stand the impact of a big plane. 
Fires weren&#39;t strong enough proof of that is there were people still alive at the impact zone.
 
 
Some people still believe that steel skycrappers can collapse straight down due to fire....
911 was an Israeli/USA Zionist Nazi job
a. The steel bars in WTC1/2 did not melt, they simply weakened from the heat and they weakened to a point that they couldn&#39;t hold. Metal gets weak with heat, WTC beams would obviously give away before melting to molt steel. 
b. WTC7 didn&#39;t fall into its own footprint, again research Barclay Street in 911. Barclay Street was never WTC7 footprint, so why is WTC7 fall over it? 
c. No WTC fell &#39;&#39;near free fall speed&#39;&#39;. Time it yourself using videos &amp; freefall formula with WTC height. 

Finally; 
a. The 20,000 gallons of jet fuel didn&#39;t stop burning during that hour, in fact there was still  a large fire after both towers collapsed. 
b. When huge skyscrapers fall on the ground a small seismic event isn&#39;t unusual. 
c. No skyscraper on earth is built to withstand an impact from a jet with 20,000 gallons of jetfuel. If so find me 1, just 1. &amp; please don&#39;t bring me an example with a building where a small propeller plane crashed LOL
Newtons 3rd law? Obviously you don&#39;t even know its implication. 
Here&#39;s an experiment; put a 5lbs bowling ball on your foot, notice it doesn&#39;t hurt. Now; put that same bowling ball 7 feet in the air &amp; drop it on your foot. For a second you will have over 50lbs of pressure on your foot. This is because the kenetic energy of the balls fall slammed on your foot. 
 Steel bars holding 50 tons of concrete can hold but if it falls 7 ft will duplicate the weight thus it wont hold. 
Welcome to reality.
go to sleep.
If your theory were correct then a kerosene heater would melt into a puddle in minutes, because they burn at the same heat and they are built out of thin steel. I would also like to hear your theory on building 7 that wasnt hit by a plane and collapsed perfectly into its own footprint at almost the speed of gravity,,, virtually no resistance at all. You should consider a career in physics

So you think the planes didn&#39;t hit the WTC? 
Reality check; Pentagon &amp; WTC steel means were only that; beams. But both buildings outside was mostly window, and inside it had far more weaker material [mostly heat-absorbents]. 
Also; many jets have steel, iron and some titanium.
I know what he said, I&#39;ve watched the interview a dozen times. Actually both WTC 1 and 2 did stand after a jet with (supposedly) 20,000 gallons of fuel hit them and burnt for an hour. After the temperature had already peaked and the fuel had burned off, there was some kind of seismic event that actually registered like a weak earthquake and the first building collapsed. Then, later another and the second twin tower collapsed. Both were built to withstand multiple impacts of that magnitude. 
WTC did have a major fire, and it also lost 1/3 of its columns from WTC2 debris which fell on it. 
This according to firemen working in the scene. Hey.....but what do they know? LOL
1 floor gives and the rest will obviously give? So the 79th floor of WTC 2 can give and then it can magically disregard Newton&#39;s third law and push all 78 floors below it straight to the ground without an equal and opposite reaction? Oh I see it was a &quot;domino-effect collapse.&quot; Why don&#39;t you link me to a good definition of a &quot;domino-effect collapse?&quot; You should have contributed to the NIST report with that kind of knowledge of structural engineering. 
Obviously you have never burned up gasoline or jet fuel. 
Fuel burning time depends on how much fuel is exposed to oxygen. The more fuel, the less exposure. 20 gallons of jetfuel take far more then 30 seconds to burn. 
Have a nice day.
Since when does Aluminum skinned planes slice through Steel I beams?

Here a test you can do in your backyard, take a soda can that&#39;s full, throw it with all your might against anything that is steel you may have in your yard, If you are living in the same dimension as I do where the same laws of physics apply aluminum being the softer metal will not chop through because It&#39;s not possible.
jet fuel burns up entirely within ~30 seconds and thats being generous with time
WTC7 was NOT hit by a plane
WTC7 was not set on fire by jetfuel
WTC7 was built to withstand MISSLE ATTACKS. Do eye have to draw you a map? :-/
Surely people are smarter than that.
It&#39;s already been explained, you just have to do a couple hours of research. Sorry it can&#39;t be presented and spoon-fed to you in less than 500 characters. Do you understand that none of the three WTCs that collapsed could have collapsed all the way to the ground due to fire and structural damage without breaking Newton&#39;s third law? The supports had to be weakened or cut entirely on lower floors to allow it. Hence the discovery of sliced beams and thermite residue in the rubble. Start there.
Only possible if a 747 smacks into it, destabilizing it&#39;s foundation. 
your logic comes from hollywood :D
There&#39;s a lot of bullshit, but it&#39;s mostly exaggerated and perpetuated by those trying in vain to discredit the Truth Movement. Like the &quot;no plane theory.&quot; There is no &quot;no plane theory.&quot; Debunkers just erected a cheap straw man to knock down. There&#39;s been a lot of good forum discussion over the last decade trying to put all the pieces together.
A jet with 20,000 of jet fuel has never hit a skyscraper in history until 911. 
Jetfuel burns FAR hotter then normal fire [the fire in this video], it doesn&#39;t need to melt steel for it to give. The hotter any metal, including steel, gets, the weaker the metal. Eventually with the weight anything gives. 
Jet hits building, jetfuel burns for an hour, steel baring&#39;s heat up, weaken  give in leading to a domino-effect collapse. 1 floor gives, the rest will obviously give.
And thats why the top should slide of and not make some spots explode before in downfloors before  the top reaches it and now take closeby buildings with it with same freefall speed :D
Obviously WTC1&amp;2 didn&#39;t fall on their footpring, their debris hit most buildings around them. They fell anywhere but their footprint. 
As for WTC7, research Barclay Street in 911. Barclay Street is not WTC7 footprint yet if fell over it. 
Here&#39;s what Larry Silverstein REALLY said from his own mouth; /watch?v=p34XrI2Fm6I  
Many skyscrapers can handle a plane crash but no skyscraper on earth can stand after a jet with 20,000 gallons of jetfuel hits them &amp; burns for an hour [at jetfuel heat].
The odds of a drunk Russian starting this fire? 
very good. &lt;-I&#39;m not takin shots at Russians.
The arguments in support of the official 9/11 fiction are so tired it&#39;s hard for me to read one without falling asleep.
I think your brain has some major columnar damage. One column is (possibly) weakened from fire relatively low in temperature compared to the melting point of steel and the entire building collapses floor by floor, more or less straight down? Such a thing has never happened before or since so your opinion is rooted in blind faith and naivete rather than logic. This hotel behaves the way we would expect a professionally engineered building to behave when engulfed in fire; smoke and no collapse.
John Farmer doesn&#39;t believe in the science reported by engineers. He doesn&#39;t have to believe in the science......he&#39;s no scientist, no engineer, etc. 
I don&#39;t get my info on engineering from a lawyer, just like i don&#39;t get my info. in law on an engineer. 
John Farmer didn&#39;t write the science in the 911 report, he simply presented &amp; validated it. Just like lawyers don&#39;t know if homes as fire-safe but they have to validate it as fire-safe for insurance purposes. 
This isn&#39;t rocket science.
People are so stupid,if they believe that a plane can bring down a  building in freefall speed i would say :D
someone had a nokia :D

Shouldn&#39;t have fallen asleep without putting out that joint :S
lol

That would almost work except the high there today was in the mid 70s.
Go shine it. You know it&#39;s impossible for any skyscraper to collapse straight down if only one column is damaged. You know the twin towers were built to withstand multiple plane impacts. You know everyone cares about WTC7 because Larry Silverstein decided to &quot;pull it.&quot; The charges used to cut through the columns would have been discovered had WTC7 been allowed to remain standing, so of course it had to be pulled. It wasn&#39;t whatever aliens either. It was the Bush administration and George Tenet.
Perfect!!!!!!!!!!
has the building fallen down yet guys. its been more than 24 hours in Chechnya now. 
as for the jet fuel...what do you think that huge fireball was? That was the jet fuel burning off outside the building. Even the official story says that the jet fuel burned away almost totally on impact
you never wondered how the lightest 20 top floors could crush down through 90 lower floors without having an equal and opposite reaction?
I&#39;m sure the gravity is different in Russia. That mixed with the cold temperatures do not permit for an environment capable of a complete building collapse, into it&#39;s own footprints.

-US Government Explanation
Go fuck yourself and whoever you work for
We&#39;re gonna hang the mother fuckers that really pulled off 911
But not before slowly torturing them till they beg for it
Count on it
Never Forget - Never Forgive
ps; John Farmer is and never was an engineer, much less an engineer that worked inside 911.
First the BBC has to report that it has collapsed, and then it will collapse about 30 minutes later.
you are right &quot;any idiot can see from the video it was a demolition&quot; is 100% right

the only criteria was to be an IDIOT  LOL... anyone who is not an idiot, unfortunately for the idiots, wouldn&#39;t be able to see this... lol

ok thumb me down AND FEEL LIKE A CONSPIRACY THEORY NUTTER!!!!  xD !! 
Physics? That shit you posted you think its physics? You are a definition of a insecure moron that thinks he is something, but is nothing in reality.
no surprise that your comment got all the negative votes... disinformation and conspiracy nuts galore here... (ya thumb this down and feel like a big conspiracy nut!!  LOL) 
where are the pancakes?
WTC had pancakes
Free fall equation; 9.7536 m / s^2 
WTC did not fall this fast, not because of sound but because of visual evidence. Anyone including yourself can watch a 911 video, use the formula &amp; compare it to the height of WTC. BTW; WTC2 stayed in the airfor 1 second 3 quarters of the way down. 
Most buildings in this video fell due to explosives in 1 column; /watch?v=sK50So-yYRU 
Steel buildings are held together by vertical bars which drag the rest of the building down when a column gives.
4/3 was an inside job.
how can this be a 9/11 job when it&#39;s april?

WTC did not fall over because of its unique design. it had its steel framework on the outside. 
Pull It !!
Look at that it isn&#39;t collapsing. They must make them to last in Russia lol. But seriously I hope none was injured
Did it collapse yet?
I was watching untill the end but I was surprised when the building didn&#39;t collapse on itself...strange thing...I though every building falled down when there was a fire...

building is saved people,go back to your homes,nothing to see here
Did a plane hit it?
raging inferno, pancake collapse

Some of the terms used over and over in 9/11 deceit!!!

What a disgrace!
NOOOO MY LAPTOP WITH ALL MY PORN NOOOO!!!
Did it collapse hmmm probably not....
Just because a website claims demolition experts say X thing does not mean those people are experts, far less that &#39;&#39;X thing is true&#39;&#39;. 
Skyscrapers don&#39;t fall in &#39;&#39;free fall speed&#39;&#39;, including WTC; /watch?v=qLShZOvxVe4 
No WTC fell on its footprint, obviously WTC1&amp;2 didn&#39;t, but research Barclay Street in 911. Barclay street is &amp; never was WTC7 footprint. Ask yourself why WTC7 fell over it? 
Most demolitions of old buildings are done by the destruction of 1 column. 
Alex Jones wont say this LOL

fail...
free independent Chechnya and dagestan from warmongers puppet kosher Russia please.  there is no audio.

is the new 9/11 inside job building fall down yet.
According to 911 commission, wtc fell because of fire. Lets see it this happens here.
Aren&#39;t they supposed to collapse at freefall speed when they catch on fire????
Did you really just use that example? Aluminum plane weighting many tons and travelling at top speed is different, from smashing a steel anvil with s aluminum pipe.. as usual RT comments filled with dumbasses and retards.
Would you care to bet everything you own on your full commercial liability against your statement? Let&#39;s see you do it in real life.
What you just stated is impossible. An aluminum plane cannot slice thru a buildings super structure &amp; jet fuel does nothing to steel fool. For a joke, I&#39;m willing to bet you couldn&#39;t smash a steel anvil with a hollow aluminum pipe. I already know that you cannot show me the basic physics to explain Newton&#39;s third law in relation to planes hitting the buildings.
A youtube video doesn&#39;t make you an expert on demolition. 
Every building is different, some buildings have fallen because 1 column gives, this is because of domino effect which depends on the engineering of the building. 
In 911 all WTC3-7 had roof damage but none had the same column &amp; fire damage as WTC7. 
Anyways who cares about WTC7? No 1 died in it. If the illuminati nibirus aliens wanted 911 as an excuse for war, 0 deaths in WTC7 was unnecessary. 
Now let me go shine my tinfoil hat! LOL
What, it&#39;s not falling at free fall speed in on it self, but that&#39;s what the American government says happens to skyscrapers with even a localized fire, liars.
wtc 7 was far away from wtc 2 - there was no column damage from one building&#39;s debris to the next building. At least 50 people died in wtc7 - it was not empty - and family members on buildingwhat . org will confirm THEIR Family members died in THAT building.
Jet fuel &amp; office debris also can&#39;t burn at 2000 F for 30 days solid underground with no oxygen, yet that&#39;s precisely what happened at &quot;ground zero&quot; for wtc 1 and 2.
and the jet fuel already was nearly done burning before the collapse, people were standing where the fire should kill them and it didn&#39;t. And the actual slicing fire, the thermite, happened 10 floors below all other fire, and 10 floors lower again, every 10 floors, moving faster than any falling object or spreading fire could go. And those beams on fire were sliced through every 10 floors like a hot sword through butter sticks. every 10 floors.
there&#39;s no such thing as &quot;slicing through the super-structure&quot;
You don&#39;t bring a building 110 stories tall to its footprint by taking off the top 10 floors, and the planes didn&#39;t even do that.
look at the name on the front of the building and then watch olympus has fallen
north korea  is going to nuke US or be a false flag
And yet this building will not fall to its footprint from fire because no building ever has. Including WTC 1 and 2 and 7
I once saw a building collapse entirely because a truck ran into it. 
Point being; every building is built differently. X disaster may cause 1 building to collapse while that same method wont work on a different building.
It wasn&#39;t demolition charges, it was 2 Boeing jets with over 20,000 gallons of jet fuel that crashed into WTC 1 &amp; 2. 
WTC 7 was major column damage from WTC2 debris falling, plus a fire, plus a pulley. But hey; who cares about WTC7? It was already old and no 1 died in it that day.
WTC7 had major columnar damage from WTC2 debris outfall. 
This building does not.
the jet fuel was exhausted in the explosion initially.  the jet is not made of the metal or any material that is able to sever a steel ibeam and concrete columns.  additionally.  No plane hit building 7.  what about that one?  ;)
Go look up about the B2 Bomber that hit the Empire state building in 1945
Any moment now it&#39;s going to come crashing down.... any moment now... it&#39;s still standing huh?
In 1945 a B 2 Bomber hit the Empire state building(smashing threw 7 walls)
The building opened up 2 days later.So this whole theory of planes bringing down buildings with fuel,just doesn&#39;t wash.
Also doesn&#39;t explain building 7 coming down as well.
Let&#39;s face it..we have been had .
Nice sarcasm dude !
@ 0:57 Wow, Hagia Sofia &quot;clone&quot; in Chechnya !
It&#39;s gonna be a hot time in the old town tonight.
LOL..ya right !! :)
If this doesn&#39;t disprove the propaganda about Building 7, then nothing will.
The molten steel described by fire fighters. Have you been paying attention or just relying on your fox news programing ? These things i have mentioned are known to most who have done any research beyond msm. Time to catch up.
Shut the fuck up you fucking idiot.
Supernanothermite it was.
Nor was there on building 7, not one of these comments is referring to buildings 1&amp;2 (the only ones you even heard about, considering you are a fucking sheep).
search this here: Financial 9 11 Following the Money Trail Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole i&#39;d link but they stopped making it too easy for us to access info...
Yeah except there is no plane that sliced through the buildings super structures support beans and no jet fuel...
Jesus Christ what did they use to paint/clad this building with napalm? The entire side surface area just erupted in flame. Russian building code sux!
god hates crappy carpenters HAHAHHAHAHAH
IKR poor russia keeps getting all this unlucky stuff
i think the insulation might have been a little FLAMABLE!!!

Not WTC 7. NO plane hit that building, but it came down the exact same way. Even NIST had to admit in 2008 that WTC 7 came down at free fall descent for 2.25 seconds. What removed the resistance? Fire? So this building should crumble any minute. And WTC 7 was CIA headquarters and the mayor&#39;s bunker. Good thing Larry doesn&#39;t own this skyscraper, he would &quot;PULL IT&quot;
I thought they used KRAZY GLUE and 100 mph duct tape, you know the one NASCAR uses. LOL But the grey duct tape that has powdered alluminum, that could cause the pools of molten steel in the basements for 8 weeks. I like your story better, but the sheeple would buy this story too. LOL
what? and it didnt fall on its footprint within minutes?isnt thats whats supposed to happen?
hmmmm cheap ass soviet building burning on every floor top to bottom n burning pretty good doesnt crumble, american super structures built by brilliant architects and engineers in the most populated space on each per square foot (including up lol) burns on lets say 15 floors, no lets say 25 to be generous collapses faster then free fall speed into dust in its own basement hmmmmmmm, maybe putin set it on fire to make a point lol
It was also hit by a giant airplane.

WTC was a daam LEGO 
I guess Russia&#39;s skyscrapers are better built than New York&#39;s. Even better built than the mayor&#39;s bunker and CIA headquarters. LOL Only in N.Y. city do skyscrapers collapse from fire, at free fall descent. 
Actually the WTC towers weren&#39;t wielded beams...they used SUPER GLUE....and once one joint broke...they all broke.....melted steel pools at bottom?....WTC actually had a steel forge company move in using the basement floors....WTC7 ? When built there was a large chain hooked to the one main column...and in event of fire...you pull the chain...building comes down..(secret NSA files)hey, this is better than their story!
the real terrorists org should see this VIDEO..   AKA JEWISH ELITES AND PUPPET WAR CRIMINAL.
Неправильный порядок. Сначала белый, потом синий, после синего — красный. Да и с чего вы взяли? Ни одного человека не пострадало ведь.
Stalin hated everyone, who turned their back on him during the Great Patriotic war.
Silverstein forgot to plant the explosives maybe next time .
burned for more than one hour and did not fall down into it&#39;s own foot print now there is a surprise?
Any minute now that steel framed building will collapse into its own footprint. LOL Oh nevermind, I doubt Dick Cheney is involved, since he is racist against Asians. 
read the title guys.  its in Chechnya.
thats weird it didnt pancake down like the world trade center did 911 must be a inside job 
Wow, can&#39;t believe this didn&#39;t Cave in on itself like a controlled Demolition.
&quot;Focus on something else like our sorry excuse for a government&quot;... that&#39;s exactly what we talkin about
All you WTC official story people crack me up. do you realize that&#39;s some buildings have many central steel beams! The WTC design and the jet fuel it was designed to handle was and inert combination. If it was constructed differently if would have still not fallen. None the less still not at free fall.
Have you ever seen a building callapse like that without controlled Det?
Have you ever seen how much work it takes to stage and set up enough explosives to bring down a building? It takes weeks and crews of people drilling and running fuses everywhere. You conspiracy nuts think this was done in 3 of the WTC buildings without anybody noticing it. Focus on something else like our sorry excuse for a government.
this building is on fire from top to bottom and is a much less structurally build building than the WTC and it still standing?
WTC #7 was neither hit by a plane nor was on fire anywhere near this building but yet it implodes somehow? If you still believe the 9-11 government lie, then you will never believe any truth
its a mosque.  Chechnya is a Islamic nation.
wow looks way hotter than wtc... wonder when the demo charges are gonna go... and it freefalls to earth
All you WTC conspiracy people crack me up. Do you realize that some buildings don&#39;t have any   steel I-beams in the construction? The WTC design and the Jet fuel was just a bad combination. If it was constructed differently maybe it wouldn&#39;t have fallen.

lol ya thats it
Jesus never required sacrifice.

&quot;Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgement to the Son....&#39;&#39; 
&quot;You [Jews/Pharisees] judge by human standards; I pass judgement on no one.&quot; 
&quot;As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it.&quot;
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

Equality is a terror for many :)
im pretty sure that&#39;s a mosque
It wasn&#39;t constructed like the WTC&#39;s and Jet Fuel is not involved.
yet the towers fell?? #OpStopTheBullshit 9-11 is a lie
jet aircraft aimed at a building is a bit more missile like than a regular building fire. Twin towers were proberbly dropped by the plane attacks BUT Building 7s however is pretty suspect.
 &amp; the offficial truth???...... well thats definatly a theory  
Why hasn&#39;t it fallen yet?
not going to fall down like 911.bush messed this one up.
NO TNT was used in the buildings, what a shocker.
surprise they haven&#39;t blamed IRAN OR NK yet.
How about that, it&#39;s still standing.
its like sim city.
Shit did the building just fired like that...
No they forgot the special secret ingredient, thermite
Weird. I still don&#39;t see any physics equations in there. Are you mentally capable? Do you not realize I already know you are not able to provide basic high school science for me. I already know you can&#39;t even do grade 5 science. I am toying with you. I am making you dance. I already know you will say and do everything you can to avoid typing an equation. Cry all you want. a real man would just give the answer. LoL. 
Now - Dance! Whine some more &amp; Show everyone here what a tool you are.
NO 9/11 inside job than.
....jesus. 

It was a hollow...
okay i disagree with Noxid because hes a idiot, but the 2 planes probably had something to do with it.
For all you physics majors, explain molten steel without a blast furnace. Also explain 3 buildings 2 plains. Explain perfectly cut columns and the rusty melted steel that ran from the cuts. Most only need common sense to know. 
It was a fuckin rabid unicorn. Get it right.
Indeed. The criminals who carried out 911 (and various other staged terror attacks) will stand before the judgment seat of Christ. There, they will not be able to hide or defend themselves. They will be judged according to their works. Theirs will be the lake of fire forever, along with all those who reject the sacrifice of the Lamb of God, Jesus Christ.
Got physics debt slave? I&#39;m waiting for you to get your daddy. I have no idea what bullshit you&#39;re going on about. All I know is that you can&#39;t give me the high school or even grade 5 science and you will say and do everything in all your messages to avoid it at all cost. Whatever false dichotomy &#39;side&#39; you think I&#39;m on is irrelevant. I asked for the equations. Come on a kid could do it. You said you need an engineer. That is an appeal to authority. I&#39;m making you dance in front of everyone here
55 sec beautiful mosque.
I see the hole the airplane went into. It&#39;s right there! right next to the plume of smoke that looks like satan, and half burnt, stolen, Egyptian passport just chillin on the 3rd floor. SEE IT? right there! 
FREE CHECHNYA AND DAGESTAN FROM WAR CRIMINAL PUPPET RUSSIA.
it was a drone missile, just like in the pentagon.

i love these video&#39;s.  no 9/11 inside job yet.
No plane went into Building 7 either.
u got owned!! lol!!
The Truth will always show itself to who seeks it. I hope none was injured or killed. What a beauty of a Masjid.
dude you are just beyond stupidity 
no hay voz de comentarista?

Heresay. Doesn&#39;t count. I heard the Keebler Elves are real. I head Unicorns like to lick each others horns. Got some physics equations? Ya know like any grown up that graduated high school or at least coasted thru it could provide? Or do you need your daddy engineer to do it for you? Explain Newtons third law in relation to the planes hitting the buildings &amp; then explain how the law of conservation of momentum applies to the buildings collapsing. I can take it, I&#39;ll wait while you get ur daddy
Back then no plane went in there to start a chain reaction.
I don&#39;t see structural damage.
The lack of justice is shameful &amp; people feel it to the core of their being &amp; will never stop fighting for it ;)
Oh yea, sure, just cause you say so. Got links for the interviews? There&#39;s a lot more interviews with Sandy Hook families than anyone can ever find for the Passenger families. I didn&#39;t say people in New York. I don&#39;t give a fuck who was watching what. I don&#39;t care what civlians watched on a TV. I asked for an answer to a high school physics question that bitches like you dance around for the last 6yrs. All you&#39;re gonna do is mouth off. You said you needed an engineer which means you can&#39;t do it
I&#39;m probably the zillionth person to say this, but it bears repeating: This just goes to show you that 9/11 truthers are not batshit crazy!
What a shame it is that we can&#39;t all just marvel at such a disaster, and thank God that nobody got hurt (hopefully). Instead, the only thing any of us can think of is the greatest &quot;terrorist&quot; hoax ever perpetrated - 911.

The fact is that no high rise building EVER collapsed because of a fire. Anyone who will not acknowledge that the WTC was purposely destroyed by controlled demolition with 3,000 people inside, is just not paying attention, for whatever reasons...
I bet you think David Copperfield really did do magic &amp; really did saw that woman in half don&#39;t ya :)

Tricks are just that, tricks, slight of hand, there is no magic only illusion. Some see it for what it is &amp; others like yourself chose to &quot;believe&quot; in the illusion because they fear the alternative. Reality :)
You need to do a bit more research, sky scrapers regardless are built to endure all manor of disasters without collapsing. /watch?v=65Qg_-89Zr8

Point being if the official version of building 7 was true then no skyscraper in the USA is safe from collapse from even minor fires. So why are people still living &amp; working in them? Look at the San Fransisco earth quake, more people died from fire than collapsed buildings. Google: Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth.
cont&#39;d - Then after that (the equations for the third law of motion in relation to planes hitting the buildings), you can give some calculations for the law of conservation of momentum in relation to the collapsing buildings. It&#39;s really pretty basic high school science or do you need to go get ur daddy building engineer with a degree in physics to explain it? You fucking Tool. Don&#39;t worry, I know you can Never give me the equations, you will just dance like my bitch and whine. Guaranteed.
Russia was an inside job!
An appeal to authority. Do you really need an engineer to tell you how to calculate grade 5 science? Then you are completely incompetent. I see above you do the appeal to emotion routine. These 3,000 people you speak of - where are their family members? Why are there no interviews with over 800 family members of passengers. Ever walk into a dojo with a box cutter? See how far you would get. How about showing some calculations for the 3rd law of motion in relation to planes hitting the buildings.
How Russia demonstrates the obvious flaws in the official version of 911 building 7 collapse.

The alternative being Anything made in America is tottal crap &amp; not fit to keep a hamster in.
I clicked to see the building collapse. It didn&#39;t.....I&#39;ll go look for another. However, I won&#39;t hold my breath.
Ya, you tell &#39;em Noxid fuck!!!

*stick butter
YOu&#39;re right. Now that I have a second look, they must have had some serious flammable office furniture and or building materials. This fire is way more intense than wtc tower 1 &amp; 2 &amp; &quot;7&quot; ~!
Don&#39;t let my outfit throw you. ;-p 
Debunked!
Allowing your questionable conclusion as accurate. How many aircraft struck building 7? How much jet fuel was burning in building 7? What were the lower level explosions long before the collapse caused by? Why did news media report building 7&#39;s collapse on live television before the event occurred? What does the term &quot;pull it&quot; mean in reference to buildings? How long does it take to plan, set and detonate explosives to demolish a large building? Why do you believe known liars?
It was made of Rearden Metal.
No next to free fall collapse?
9/11 = inside job
Google &quot;WTC b7&quot; &quot;AE911 truth&quot;
I R Troll
Just a little bit of paint and it will shine like new, of course it isn&#39;t an american building. hahahahaha
WTC must have been made of cheese.
Thank you Russia for exposing 9/11 Lies Hopefully the sheeple will see this video.
Love&amp;Light
ha ha owned
Wow! That looks way hotter than the World Trade Center fires.
It must have come crashing down not long after the video shot.
Here&#39;s the deal. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re the Muslim Box Cutter Wielding &#39;Evil Doers&#39;. 
And let&#39;s say you&#39;ve planned this &#39;attack&#39; for 10 years. (As we were told)
And you hit the buildings at what time? 
10:00 a.m. right? I mean, that would be when everyone was in there. ALL FORTY THOUSAND of them. Jihad Baby!! 10:00, right? 

No?

You hit it at 8:35 a.m.? 
WHY??? Noone was even really there yet. 
What? 3000?

What do you mean that&#39;s the number of acceptable collateral damage with the US. 
Check Pharbor
The suspense is killing me!!!
me too, then made one of my own

surely this symmetrically collapse into its own footprint leaving relatively little debris and creating a massive pyroclastic flow any minute now...
Not really conspiracy shit if it can be backed with factual evidence...
I clicked on this just to see all the tower collapse references. 
Russians just showed America that 9/11 was a INSIDE JOB.
Love&amp; Light
Can your physics 101 explain to me how can a big passenger jet go through the building completely undamaged , and then explode from the inside just a few moments later? What happens at the moment of impact? Which physics laws can we apply in this situation?
I wonder if they will find the passport of the person who started the fire in perfect condition, a few blocks away from the building?
The video of it collapsing into it&#39;s own footprint should get posted anytime now.
It&#39;s a comparison Dick
na vse volia ALLAHA. iz ruin vozradilis&#39; etu железоБеттонную kanstrukciyu vostanovim INSHA ALLAH есть в планах зделать самые высокие башни v Evrope
200 tonnes of thermite detonated simultaneously will pulverize anything and the heat from the thermite will leave pools of molten iron on the ground with fires burning for weeks afterwards.

After the thermite is detonated in the basement, followed by computer controlled blasting of ever girder in the building, there is no way the pulverized concrete could handle the pressure.

And the reason the buildings didn&#39;t tip over is because they had been reduced to dust.

Fixed.
I think Russia is mocking dumb ass sheep of the USA
Quick, Where&#39;s Dick?  If that building comes down, somebody better find him &amp; his little buddy Bush.
Cardboard.
They can only make something that works if they have 20 attempts at doing it
Slavakris126‏ ‏Fuck russia usa and israil +79538950590
So did this building collapse an hour later?
What is that façade made of !?
Russian engineering
5 minutes after the video recording stopped the building collapsed.
:) 
Ha Ha Ha
Пиздец.
HAHAHAHAHA That was a good one. I want to know how buildings turn to dust in mid air. 
Now we should see the building vaporize and fall straight down right?
It should have collapsed like on 9/11, why didn&#39;t it collapse!!! ?
Do you know anything about Logic in linguistics?
Let me say that you just pulled off one of the most common one: Argumentum ad Ignorantiam. 
That&#39;s Latin by the way, just so you know what to google for.
Then you pulled a «ad Logicam», and not satisfied by it you presented to us with the classic «ad Nauseam».
This might help you in future dialogues - not looking like a disillusioned tool. 
The world trade center buildings didn&#39;t collapse, they disintegrated! They turned to fucking rubble before they hit the ground, explain that one Einstein.
hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Architects &amp; Engineers for 911 Truth. Bro.
its going to collapse perfect and symmetrical at free fall speed into its own foot print any minute now......I know it
Where do you get your brown shirts tailored?

Haha! The irony!
LOL I noticed. (deleted comment)
Aw, about the gyroscope wannabe theory... Are you kidding or are you an actual child?! You must be... Those things help the building to deal with oscillation caused by winds and potential earthquakes. It doesn&#39;t have the power to balance a falling building, not even multiple counterweights.
Lead WTC Structural Engineer John Skilling was rightfully confident that neither the impact of a large passenger jet nor the ensuing office fires was capable of bringing down the Twin Towers.
Physics, mate.
by experience , I can say for certain this building will soon turn into powder and fall on its own footprint faster than free fall speed. I&#39;ve seen it happen with my own eyes! 
Smells like 90s.
Get your physics right, citizen.
Steal melts at 1500ºC. It might hypothetically soften over a long period of time, but then Kerosene burns way too quickly to maintain the proper heat. Even if that heat ought to be held by the office&#39;s plastics and other equipment, it would take more than a day constant burning to even bend a brutal steel column.
Even if those hypothesis did happened, the remaining structure would hold everything at one piece.
But BOTH buildings and building 7 coming down?
-.-
THE OWNERS GOT TERRORISM INSURANCE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO DONT WORRY
You don&#39;t see that coming down like in the W.T.C in N.Y.C ha, ?????

Yeah I think 9/11 was an inside job
Hey, Alice! Wake the fuck up, go take some physics classes and stop being such a factious tool.
You can be all proud and nationalist, but remember that you&#39;re not getting any profit from having your countrymen killed by some elitists&#39; agenda. You&#39;re just obediently looking away from it all.
Conspiracy? That&#39;s only the word your corrupt media decided to deride out of sheer stupidity. It&#39;s not a pejorative term at all, your founding father did that to overthrow oppressors.
Wonderland isn&#39;t real.

Oh I guess that the fact this building didn&#39;t collapse during a fire proves that 9-11 was an inside job, I mean two buildings couldn&#39;t possibly be built differently could they? And the impact of a jet plane full of fuel would obviously have no effect whatsoever on a buildings structual integrity.
wow a building on fire, so dramatic.
Wat happened to fire bending the metal supports
A fire in Chechnya&#39;s Chechnya*
give me sources, not your &quot;bro&quot; shit
dude los zetas are a drug cartel in mexico...
Bin laden did it W/ Bush, Cheney and Zbig
[citation needed]
world trade centre number 7 didn&#39;t have nearly as much fire as this building, and yet they pulled it (controlled demolition)... 9/11 was an inside job  
Its Fake! if it was real if would have fallen down already

The fire was obviously started by north koreans.
911 was an inside job.

If you still believe in the official story, wake up
Wow it did not fall down like the world trade center. Interesting. Wake up.
great comment!!!
You have a turd for brains. Even if the Towers wouldn&#39;t have fallen the US would still get revenge. Stop spreading your conspiracy shit all over the internet. nobody wants to hear it. 
umm you know theres these things called time zones....
If you hear silverstein say pull it.....RUN!
gee wiz, big fire, no building collapse 
may be a conspiracy of the Americans because they want to control all those damn ..

did the building ca-lapse like 911????  nope...  WTC 7... fell without any airplane flew into it...
no
I&#39;m with Mulla and what I came across here has far exceeded my expectations. Ppl think the truthers seriously believe this building will collapse. The obvious sarcasm employed by truthers is for humor&#39;s sake. They know this building won&#39;t collapse due to fire because they know the WTC&#39;s didn&#39;t either nor could they have. The fact that some of you can&#39;t even see this leaves none to question your stupidity for it is quite apparent that not only are you ignorant but you have chosen to remain so.
MORE fire, then was on Building 7 of the World Trade Centers and WATCH , IT WILL NOT COLLAPSE.

 NO Plane hit Building 7, only limited fire, but it collapsed HMMMMM???????
Blind, ignorant, fool. The lie has hit you so hard that you can&#39;t even believe your own eyes. Your eyes see buildings being exploded from top to bottom on 9-11, but you can&#39;t believe them. You&#39;ll rather believe that it was a collapse. A collapse that happened at free fall speed, that pulverized the concrete, and that left a lake of molten iron at the bottom. FOOL! 
Гори, гори, моя звезда...
Agreed - designs can&#39;t take every potentiality into account. But the frame design is a 2ndary I think - the issue is that 3 buildings imploded into their own footprints. Physics says that WTC 1 &amp; 2 (at least) should have tipped one way or another, with the upper secition falling in the direction of the core failure, in a big chunk. That&#39;s sure as hell NOT what happened! The buildings lost core support - how it was done is up for debate, but I lean towards thermite &amp; energy weapon. They exist.
is that sarcasm, not quite sure.

The BBC reported the fire 40 minutes before it started!
its just started you sap

Doesn&#39;t explain world trade center 7 now does it? O.o
Why are these buildings obeying the laws of physics and not imploding?
How many intact passports been found?
When is that building on the right not even on fire going to implode into its own footprint?
but not hot enough to melt it , though most burnt on impact , but hey small observations make all the difference
Russia&#39;s not-as-devistating 9/11.
now youre just making everyone look foolish
Everything you saw on 911 was pre made CGI, although you can be assured that the Empty 911 Complex was demoed.

And the building around it too, just like WTC building 7.
I can&#39;t  believe Americans bought that &quot;collapsed because of fire&quot; bullshit. That is just amazing to me. I expected Bush to come with something like that, but I did not expect most of the US population to be as dumb as Bush. I should&#39;ve open my eyes when he got elected.That is sad, because you had/have some great  people out there, that you don&#39;t appreciate enough.
P.S.:
Any plane driving is out of the question cause i am affraid of heights, that is the main reason why am i interested in such a career.
I&#39;ll level all high buildings to the ground and all my fears will be gone.
(i tried to post a tel.no, but that doesn&#39;t seems to be allowed here.)
JOB APPLICATION:
If I were a part of this &quot;nanothermite demolition crew&quot; i would use the clock from the top of the building as the timing mechanism. I promisse that the building will not free fall, or collapse on it self. 
I can&#39;t promise but i&#39;ll do my best to crash it on that cross the street high building and level it. 
You get one tower 4free, it&#39;s on the house since i am newbie in this business.
a funny thing happens when planes impact buildings...all the jet fuel explodes on impact....most of which explodes outside the buildings. you can see this for yourself in the footage of the impacts. Even if the towers&#39; strength was weakened because of the impacts, they wouldnt have exploded into dust onto themselves like they did...Oh and building 7 never had a plane hit it but it managed to collapse just like the towers did...
plain what? yogurt?
Man that should collapse into itself perfectly straight down floor by floor any minute....
ok thanks ill look it up, but we must be careful what designers says, just like the Titanic designer says that nothing can sink it the same thing could have happened to the wtc designer about plane crashes. 
I&#39;ll just bite my tongue, rather than reply to these 9/11 &quot;truthers&quot;.
Shit, it&#39;s probably gonna fall straight down into its own footprint at free-fall speeds!! And then show thermals of liquid hot steel for two weeks after!! And then get carted off to China to get recycled, instead of investigated!!
What, no thermal expancion?
That&#39;s a shame, it&#39;s a nice building. It looks like a elevator shaft fire. I&#39;m glad that no one was hurt.
building 7 was 47 stories...
Dumb ass its plane!!! And ur as dumb Fuck its russia vvv
Bet it does not either, and the WTC should not have either... It was designed to withstand a plane smashing into it. But a funny thing happens when gallons and gallons of jet fuel is spread on steel... long story short it gets really hot and then jeopardizes the strength and the durability of the structure...  These two buildings are different kinds and this one does not have all the jet fuel to make this fire burn REALLY hot.
Not unless Mossad have explosives in the basement
Wonder why it didn&#39;t collapse   Haha lol only in America I guess :)
And you ever heard of building 7? plane never hit it either.
they didnt collapse, they exploded...
I saw the title and just came for the ironic comments about 9/11.
lol, classic. how do you know they were fully fueled? which is kind of irrelevant seeing how all the fuel exploded outside thebuildings on impact...and the twin towers were more than capable of withstanding plane impacts, they were the tallest buildings in the world when built they had that in mind. Regardless, even if the planes did enough damage, the towers would not have exploded into dust in the manner that they did. 
Smoking kills...
no plane went into building 7
lol!

made in Russia®©
Yeah probably not. Considering, you know, it didn&#39;t have a fully fueled 737 fly into it going 400 mph. I heard that tends to &quot;damage&quot; buildings
Obviously fake.
Free fall*
cause all the evidence ive seen so far says it was dodgy as f*ck
those flames are a hologram. The time on the clock must be a future date of false flag or something!
It&#39;s only 40 stories, not 100.

got any proof the official version is correct? any vids out there truthing the truthers? serious question, id like to see both sides before deciding, why do you think it was legit

apparently not, according to engineers of these kind of buildings

It might collapse
Need I say it?
Blame Israell.
It&#39;s the work of Space Zionists.
Shshshshshsh....Hush it up...!!!
 You guys and your &quot;It&#39;s going to fall right?&quot;  Engineering, is very specific. 2 different buildings. One designed in 67&#39;, This one designed 10 years ago, in Russia. Where they build Hard, and Heavy. But not fire retardant. Go home your Drunk. ^_^ Does any one have $ on a collapse?
I&#39;ll bet that 7 goat herders sitting in a cave smokin hash planned this whole thing using nothing but prayer, to plan right down to the national security, and nothing more than a black and white picture from a magazine to base their &quot;inside&quot; knowledge on.
twin towers never burned like that

Damn son
Thats going to be costlly to gut out....
It&#39;ll collapse and turn Ito dust  into its own footprint
Ha! there&#39;s already a mosque two blocks away and the building hasn&#39;t even imploded and collapsed at  free-fall speed yet : )  
when does it fall down ?
Building 7 no plane hit it, collapse reported by BBC 30 minutes before it actually happened. Fire alone does not bring down a steel framed building.
So, his insurance check is probably in the mail.
It&#39;s going to collapse any second now!
Were there any Israelis dancing in the vicinity ?
Let&#39;s just say that the US government is staffed with a bunch of demonic bellicose war profiteers.
Bet it doesn&#39;t collapse
I hear that Larry Silverstein had bought that Hotel.
the official 9/11 report says building 7 collapsed because of fire on 3 floors after a few hours
Doormen smoking.. makes it all glow with a cool firey gleem
Insurance
fuck a duck
Oh it must have collapsed into its own footprint six hours later. I heard it&#39;s normal for fire to do that to skyscrapers. 
Isn&#39;t that building 7?

oh sorry i almost stigmatized you as an ignorant sheep, i&#39;m glad you&#39;re not! ;)
That&#39;s &quot;ceased&quot; moron.
LOL Well said my honorable unknown, but now dear friend!
The usual tards comparing any building on fire to WTC, because all buildings share the same structure, and the conditions of the fire never change.
But is there a jew waiting to file an insurance claim ?
It was Al-Qaedas Fault! Stop it with the Israeli Job Conspiracy Theory! YOU VERY WELL KNOW IT WAS NOT ISRAEL!

Apparently the Mossad &amp; the rest of international jewry weren&#39;t in on this one.
Building 7 wasn&#39;t hit by a plane, and yet it fell into its footprint just the same.
Facade made of cardboard?
So who would be the BOOGIE man this time? 
I doubt it as it did not have a jet full of jet fuel slam into it! 
Lol
&quot;I wonder how long it will take the steel beams to melt and this skyscraper will fall in free fall speed into it&#39;s own footprint? I&#39;m also expecting that building on the right to drop at free fall speed as well, even though it wasn&#39;t touched by flames. Just going from what I&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot; in past similar situations&quot; - Dan Hagen
9/11 - the day the laws of nature seized to exist. 
Fucking legend, as soon as i saw the video i thought the same thing :)
No, a moron is someone who seems to think calling people names like a 5 year old somehow makes them right even if physical science says they are wrong. Show some evidence for your claims. There is certainly a significant amount of evidence against you. Explain how your right and physics is wrong. I dare you. 
Shouldn&#39;t this building implode like wtc 7?
free fall collapse in 3, 2, 1 .... damn, no collapse? whats wrong?
Yes... that&#39;s why WTC collapsed at free fall velocity. How dare those conspiracy morons believe laws of physics. We must trust everything what government says.
LOL! Depends on whether they contend that there was actually TWO fires, and collect a double claim. :) 

Shouldn&#39;t it be melting the steel supports and collapsing to the ground?
I&#39;M SORRY
I FARTED
AND FLAMES FLEW OUT MY ASS
I&#39;M SOOORRRYYYYY !!!
No nanothermite here folks... no molten steel either
Looking at your note, is the media allowed to embed your video in an article???
yes the coulds are all mossad
I&#39;m aware of this. The building that contained all of the SEC records where a hard drive was discovered to have SEC info on it, that included a pending halt on short trading of two select stocks, as the trading had gone off the charts betting these two stocks would go down. Any guess as to which stocks they were? Yep. American and United. Inside knowledge, brother. 
I also saw the interview with the owner of #7. I watched it live. He said they had to &#39;Pull It&#39;. That&#39;s a demolition term. 
Peace.
The same steel used for the World Trade Center. Only difference, this fire is from top to bottom, yet it still stands...Kind of weird wouldn&#39;t you say?
Are you familiar with the steel frame design of the WTC towers? It was SPECIFICALLY designed to withstand a plane impact, and spread the weight/stress of any section failure across the entire grid.  Kinetic impact is only relevant AFTER the collapse begins, so WTF are you talking about?! BTW, jet fuel burns about 200 degrees cooler than the temp you need to melt steel. I could list 100 more facts, but since you can&#39;t fix stupid, what&#39;s the point? You people are getting what you deserve.
who put a fucking bomb in an elevator shaft?
Russian money are burning.

yea, what a big fucking surprise, it didnt fall into its own footprint
you got that right the WTC dint burn at al lol so how can it colapse
No matter how fast an aluminum can hits a steel girder its going to fold up&amp; disintegrate... Nobody its comparing this fire trio the missles &amp; bombs that brought down the trade centers. Wake up.
Well here&#39;s a fact for ya: the WTC towers&#39; steel frames were built on a stress grid pattern that is a lot like screen door mesh. It was built to take direct hits from planes. The idea was to allow the structure to spread weight/stress across the grid, in the event of inpact or failure of any section of it. Look it up. The guy has negative votes because he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about.
and did not collapsed... so why WTC7 did?
already provokers in the comments...dafuq is wrong with you people
People in the comment section trying to compare building fire, to supposedly plane into the wtc. Nice comparison.... 
Ok fall down ?
im sleepy...
Awwwwww it never fell down :/
I believe that building can collapse at free-fall speed on itself because government and media said so. I must trust our great lordly godlike G.W.Bush rather than the laws of physics...I love government so much. You conspiracy theorist are all crazy.
BaZing.
Oh nooooooo!! The people who built the Titanic didn&#39;t ever say it was SPECIFICALLY designed not o sink or anything!!!! But I guess blind shitheads dont think about that....ever.....trolololololololol
building 7 never got hit...
Ummm WHY this guy has negative votes????
He makes a valid point you know!! If you eliminate columns the support would lose strength and collapse, never mind that heat makes steel have less strength too, its true that fire on itself would NEVER collapse a building but there were other factors like the loss of most of the columns in wtc. 
I dont follow neither the official version nor the conspiracy theory... I want to follow facts.
9/11 is a lie. If not, where the fk are over 1000 bodies that were NEVER recovered? Bodies are always recovered in these kinds of disasters but not at the world trade center, the bodies just disintegrated, WTF?
the roof,the roof,the roof is on fireeee
How long before it explodes into powder and falls at free fall speed?
Run for your lives, it&#39;s gonna collapse, wait, that only happened 3 times in history, on 9/11.
yeah because no plane hit it right?!
History will show you to be in the wrong, my friend.
Column 79 should fail any minute now causing a complete virtual collapse at free fall speed..... wait for it..... wait for it....... lol
But, that being said, I agree with you. 
;)
Steel,Metal Buildings collapse by fire only in u.s.a! 
I guarantee it didn&#39;t get hit by a 707 Jetliner with a Zillion pounds of fuel on it. 
Oh right thats why they fell.... I thought it was something else, my bad. There is just too much t say , you are too far gone t try... dont forget to drink the blue koolaid.
Drathlan, wtc was designed to withstand impact from a plane. That is why it was still upright after the planes hit into them.
Not to mention the impact of a plane full of jet fuel! These conspiracy nuts must be a hoot at a beer bash. Total fucking morons!
Probability of collapse criteria: If owned by ____stein, then it&#39;s a 100% chance. Otherwise, you can barely get enough insurance coverage.
nobody knows as its never happened lol
Says a complete and utter moron!
Oh nooooooo!  The original architects of the WTC didn&#39;t ever say the building was SPECIFICALLY designed to withstand multiple plane impacts or insane amounts of fire or anything!!!!!  But I guess blind shitheads dont think about that... ever.... troolololololol.
snap!!! play on playa....
fuck Chechnya..WEHRMACHT SOLDATEN would&#39;ve used that shithole for their LATRINE.
I saw the thumbnail and was going to make a 9-11 joke... but would you believe it!??!?!?! The internet beat me too it, bravo internet bravo.......  Man that sure looks alot worse than WTC1 or 2
Was it made of Paper?
did it pancake itself and turn to dust?  what about the building next to it? did they pull it? will it cause molten steel to accumulate at the base of the structure for the next 2-3 months?  Is China on the phone yet? Wonder what the insurance policy is for this sort of thing?  Anyone have a line on SILVERSTEIN?
It will come down the same way the other towers were demolished, with explosives at points all the way down the building to get it to fall in on it self.No Bush/Cheney didn&#39;t set this fire so it wont fall down!
uuuuh huhuhu....
Holy sh*t!!
Buildings have burnt for days and are still standing today.
This and the Polish president plane crash show just how fake 9/11 was
What do you think the insurance will pay? 
Gee golly, maybe its because It&#39;s a concrete structure and it isn&#39;t a tube in tube structure and it has no kinetic impact damage. But you truthers aren&#39;t gonna attach any significance to that, are you? You won&#39;t let something like FACTS get in the way of your delusions, are you?
Is it modern steel frame? If yes it will crash within a few seconds and 2/3 of the material will turn in to dust and blow away.

Oh the predictable 9/11 referrals in the comments...
woah rt showing chechneya, never thought id see the day

Get outta the way, the building will be collapsing at a pre-set time. Oh its not in the usa. Everybody back too work we will get a fire restoration contractor on that and be up and at her in 8 weeks. Tops.
let&#39;s see if this one collapses like the fabled twin towers bullshit..  perhaps you should interview some of the idiots that came out with the &#39;official&#39; report to comment on it..  f*ckers.
Ane It didn&#39;t collapse....
the World Trade Center towers &#39;collapsed&#39; because 9 floors were on fire, 9 from 110 floors -.- it&#39;s not logical at all.
fire turns buildings into spaghetti, 911 building 7 showed us that
and the clock kept ticking...
OK - that was frigging brilliant!  Nice one. 
That can&#39;t be a real fire. The building would have fallen down already.
Anyone want to wager that this building will not collapse at all, never mind in it&#39;s own footprint? Gee golly America, those WTC buildings must&#39;ve been made of thinner steel or something, huh? 10 to 1 odds that this fire is not covered by any western MSM outlet. But you deniers aren&#39;t gonna attach any significance to that, are you? 
&quot;Prediction: it will collapse at free fall speed, and the vortex it creates will mysteriously cause another building to collapse at free fall speed several hours later.

It will be blamed on Canada and Canada will be invaded and occupied for 10 years while its oil and other resources are stolen, and meanwhile marijuana crops in Canada will skyrocket and the worlds drug markets will mysteriously be flooded with BC bud.

When Canadians fight back we&#39;ll call them terrorists&quot;.-Kyle Anderson
Just Russia proving to us dumb amerikans that the steel wont burn to ash
*cough*
luxury business in checheny ...come on  ..probably unsucessfull 
insurance claim ..bogus stunt hoax

*cough*
aahh come on ! 
Americans did it 
I guarantee that it will not collapse on itself.
