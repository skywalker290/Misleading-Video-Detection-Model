The reason we bombed two cities was mainly because a lot of industry was located in both, and if memory serves, Hiroshima wasn’t actually the original target but the alternative choice because of thick cloud cover that made them unable to see the target. But the main reasons were the fact that Japan had a lot of military factories in those two and I think some military installations as well. You also gotta realize that those people in those cities would’ve become combatants either way because if we didn’t drop the bomb we would’ve had to invade mainland Japan which likely would’ve pushed the war another 6 months to a year and resulted in a couple more million casualties.

There is an easy counter to the peter pan one, the holocaust hadn&#39;t happened yet
We warned them to surrender the first time, they refused and so we did it again. Also, we were not previously involved in the war, they bombed our military bases (Pearl Harbor) and killed 1.5k people who wanted nothing to do with the world war. They also committed numerous war crimes and even the civilians were pro-war (theyre even racist today toward non-white tourists)

For the condom in the coffee, I once got some kid to drink a coffee that had a condom in it when I was in grade 9, we went out to this park for a sporting event and there were used condoms everywhere, someone bought a coffee but didn&#39;t like it, so I and some of my mates had the stupid idea to put a condom in the coffee and give it to some Grade 8 kid, it was so funny
Ok the japan bomb one was mainly because the us wanted to flex but also because the campaign were taking too long(and dont worry its not the worst thing that happened in asia)

PewDiePie hearted a comment, that guy is so lucky!!!
The Japanese government was spreading lies to it&#39;s civilians about what the Americans would do once they took over an island or a city, so there were people jumping off cliffs and whatnot to avoid this supposed fate. Also, in Japanese culture, defeat in any capacity was very shameful, and losing a war for your emperor was the greatest dishonor you could achieve, so they were just not going to give up unless it was proved to them beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were going to lose. So, more people would have died if the war had continued. Also, American soldiers were being killed, so America was trying to preserve the lives of it&#39;s young men.<br><br>tldr: Dropping the atomic bombs on Japan saved lives that they took.
When you see someone with their pants down like that just remind them that trend started in prison to let other prisoners know they were DTF.
The reason why they bombed Japan twice is because Japan said that they didn’t have another bomb and they will continue the war, but the main goal of the bomb was to end the war, so they nuked them twice. Tbh I have no idea why they nuked a city rather than a military base, but I guess it is to  get rid of their economic structure and then when they can completely make it into a capitalist country with ease. I may be wrong with some of my info, and also I know I’m two centuries late.

In ww2 it was pretty standard to bomb civilian cities <br><br>You can’t blame America for doing it faster
The reason they bombed twice is because Japan didn&#39;t surrender after the first one
Nagasaki was the right path. It terrible and horrifying. And it made the world crap their pants.
Hiroshima and Nagasaki produced military equipment. They were also warned but they didn&#39;t evacuate. Don&#39;t let your simping for Japan get in the way of what they did in Nanking and Unit 731.
Of course they have huge spiders in large quantities in the UK, how do you think the ones in Australia got there. Once they got there they evolved, just backwards.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6nnYaUjeqw&amp;t=745">12:25</a> yes, Felix. Yes they did.. because Japan also had plans to use bombs that would spread diseases around the US killing a big portion of the population. Ofcourse this was cancelled because afew days before that America dropped the second bomb.<br><br>And secondly Hiroshima and Nagasaki were two of the most military oriented city in Japan.. they were the ones with the most military bases so I don&#39;t think civilian cities is the right word.

The Bombs were to encourage the japanese to stop the war because the japanese were ready to keep the war ongoing and more Japanese would&#39;ve died if the war went on than the two bombs. After the 2 nukes and the soviets were closing in they said screw this and gave up.

for anyone wondering about why the USA used the atom bomb understand that they told japan to surrender they even flew over Hiroshima and Nagasaki dropping leaflets saying to flee and leave the city. As a government official, they really had two options lead a ground assault in which thousands more American soldiers would die also with the knowledge that in japan at the time being a very fascist and militarian country would fight to the last man. The casualties on both sides would have been much higher the fault ultimately lies with Japanese officials at the time who maintained an aggressive attitude with no thought of surrendering even after the first atomic bomb.
They didn&#39;t bombard Hiroshima and Nagasaki in revenge for Pearl Harbor, they wanted to make Japan surrender, and after the first bomb Japan refused to surrender, so they launched another one. They where about to launch a third one, but Japan gave up. (Btw, the Pacific war started with the attack at Pearl Harbor in 1941 and finished in 1945 when Japan gave up)

Felix, the Americans dropped atomic bombs because the Japanese were committing atrocities and weren&#39;t surrendering, to the point where they put kids to kamikaze missions. Thousands of lives were lost in the first bomb, but the Japanese still wouldn&#39;t surrender. The second bomb was necessary to win the war without millions more people dying

They bombed japan twice because they did not surrender after the first one. I&#39;m not saying I agree with their ways but it&#39;s just the facts.

”Easy access for the homies” pewds: yesterday-
Ok so Japan bombed pearl harbor to prevent America from interfering in imperial Japans expansion, dragging America into war and how dare you say &quot;tHosE wErE miLiTarY BaSes sO iTs oK&quot; unnecessary lives were lost and many of them. On the subject of nuking Japan twice, America didn&#39;t nuke Japan just because Japan &quot;bombed some boats&quot;. The war had to end, and the alternative was an invasion of the Japanese mainland, causing even greater casualties on BOTH sides. Japan didn&#39;t surrender after the first bomb, so another was dropped. Learn your history next time before ignorantly ridiculing.

the reason why America bombed japan was that japan viewed dying in battle to be the greatest thing a person could do so they weren&#39;t going to surrender, if you thought d-day was bad, storming Japan&#39;s beaches would have been far worse, look at Okinawa.

Pewds talking about spiders reminds me of a few weeks ago.<br><br>I&#39;m British and was thinking how the UK is the least exotic place ever but you get huge spiders here. <br><br>One was in the kitchen the other week and my dad got a glass. The room was poorly lit.  He went to catch it and it ran near to his foot/under his slipper.<br><br>He lifted up his foot to see where it went and it had just fucking vanished...nowhere to be seen.<br><br>My Dad isn&#39;t scared of spiders and I&#39;m okay with them but my mother is TERRIFIED. As we almost gave up and walked towards the front room, I had a lightbulb moment.<br><br>I said to my Dad &quot;wait, don&#39;t sit next to Mum, check the spider didn&#39;t climb onto you.&quot; My Dad was like &quot;nah, that won&#39;t have happened.&quot;<br><br>I put the light on and looked, it was sat on my Dad&#39;s shoulder... menacingly. So glad I thought of that because my Mum wouldn&#39;t have stopped going on about it.
they bombed the Japanese twice due to the war crimes they committed it was kind of karma for them(not enough karma for what they did but good enough)

This comment section made me realize that american history books really brainwashed their kids to the point that they think dropping 2 nuclear bombs in Japan was ok
Japan did not stop colonizing its neighbor countries before the bombing, the US has no other choice but to bomb them. It took 2 bombs for the Japanese army to finally surrender in the world war. They arent the victim, they are basically the FIRE NATION of Asia during those times. It is unfortunate for the civilians to get killed, but the Japanese were the villain in that time especially in Asia.
Pearl Harbor was a civilian area and a military base. The Japanese pretty much targeted anyone that moved and mowed down many many civilians.

Pewdipie:baby yoda stew.          Me:what about ice age baby stew

The US theorized that taking the Japanese mainland would conceive multiple millions of casualties so they told Japan to surrender when they didn’t the dropped a bomb then they asked if they would surrender again they didn’t so they dropped another one, plus you know Japan ain’t surrendering any other way it’s war and that’s their art

Glad TSM is mentioned in there but TSM actually stands for Talent Suppression Machine btw.
I love the guy but he knows goddamn nothing about why we dropped the bombs
Hey pewdiepie about the military ww2 atom bombs going off: this theroy is called total war made by shermans march to the sea during the  civil war. It makes it so the soldiers who had family there want to stop fighting and go back home and it accually saved about 2 million lives by killing 1 million you can look it up some more if you want but thats the basic facts
The mosquitoes go for Marzia because as an Italian her blood is scientifically marinara sauce

For your info Pewds Japan was keeping millions in brutal conditions in camps. They wouldn’t back down so the US took extreme measures to finally end WW2
1st to comment after a year
Pewds: Mosquitoes don&#39;t bite me, they just go for Marzia.<br><br>So they&#39;re Simp-squitoes?
America didn&#39;t bomb just two cities in japan, there was several other cities bombed as well but not with atom bombs.
Wow Chris and Zach got featured
Felix talking about the use of the Atomic Bomb is honestly amazing. Can HE be the guy to run our country?
Pewdiepies next reaction should be on Japanese civilians during ww2 since he clearly doesn&#39;t understand the mindset or history
Imagine getting yelled at by pewdipie 😂

Iam willing to answer pewds question about why US bombed Jpn Twice, its because Japan control almost all over the Asians land and they are very cruel, they colonize other nation with ruthless, thats why US tr<br>y to stop jpn domination in Asian.<br> fact : actually there are 3 bomb that prepared, and the last one is for Tokyo. But after 2 bomb, Jpn surrender.

Wait what do you mean you dont understand war you had one a couple years ago?
”Ant stack” = myrstack
Alrighty, there’s no chance in hell Felix will see this but to those who have the same question, the reason the USA dropped the nukes is because it was either that or a full on amphibious invasion of Japan, which would’ve been worse than the nukes, Harry Truman had no other options. Felix if you see this somehow, there’s the answer to your question.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6nnYaUjeqw&amp;t=752">12:32</a> well the ans is simple when America first nuked hiroshima on 9 august 1947 the military didn&#39;t believed that a single bomb destroyed a whole city, they considered it a bluff and didn&#39;t surrender but when America nuked nagasaki on 11 th August japanese military realized they were overwhelmed so they surrendered. Another controversial fact is that America claims that warning posters were distributed by the airforce on the cities warning them of bombings if they didn&#39;t surrender but japanese gov says that they didn&#39;t got any warning and nuke was a surprise attack , but if america was right then the japanese dug their own graves.

I’m just sitting here thinking about what I would do if pewdiepie thought I was so annoying that he took his time to yell at me from a passing car. I would feel so stupid haha
you cant f a bike but take off the seat for the other way around
Hiroshima and Nagasaki(I don’t think I spelled them correct) where nuked because the US didn’t want to lose any other soldiers and also Nagasaki went boom because Japan refused to surrender and since the us where bombing the Japanese wooden cities so much they didn’t even realized both cities were eradicated

They used 2 bombs because the Emperor did not surrender after the first, there was a several days gap in-between the bombs. <br>Its estimated that the war would have drug on for years more and the allies might has even lost had the bombs not been used.

The bombing of two civilian cities was a preventative measure because of the Japanese kamikaze principle that would’ve resulted in countless sacrifices military wise if they wouldn’t be stopped

They bombed it twice because after the first bomb, Japan still wouldn’t surrender
Anthill or antsack
Imagine Pewdiepie opening his car window and saying &quot;Nice ass dumbass&quot; to your face
Pewdiepie talking about the guy who couldnt pull his pants up made me think of my dad and i cant unsee it
The reason they dropped two bombs is that the emperor didn&#39;t surrender immediately after the first one. The reason the bombs were dropped at all is because there was a planned invasion of Japan, which would have killed far more people than dropping the bombs. The atom bombs were actually a way to prevent loss of life.
Can we get a spider warning?
The first nuke was necessary to prevent a quarter of a million American deaths in a mainland siege on Japan similar to D-day but like 100 times worse. It is the second nuke that is debatable whether it was necessary or not
He obviously hasn&#39;t come across NSFL_

You asked where I would be in a nuclear fallout I would be dead I would rather be in heaven than live in a world where everything is a giant mutant.
Japan was doing some nasty torture stuff and cruel human experiments that tested the resilience of human life which would always end in death. Not justifying the bombing but war is shitty on both sides

It’s so simple. Even to this day. A military that had weaponized its soldiers. Sending people to die for “honor”. It’s disgusting how Japan treated their soldiers.<br><br>Not American but no clue how Felix doesn’t just know this. America threatened to do it, Japan said “We will never surrender”, so they sent it. They then asked them to surrender again, which they replied still “we will never surrender” it was very clear that they had no plans of stopping so America made it very clear they also had no plans of stopping. Japan just got out coached lmao

They did it twice because they still refused to surrender. We told them, told all the civilians there “hey, we have a weapon that’s gon whoop every single one of yall’s ass, get out of there and tell your leaders to surrender”<br>they didn’t surrender, so we dropped the first bomb.<br>Again, we dropped leaflets all over the city warning civilians and everyone honestly that we were going to do it again, that if they stayed, they’d die. They still didn’t surrender.<br>So we dropped the second one. They STILL refused to surrender until we threatened to drop a third, which we didn’t even have. The bombs were the right call. They saved more lives than they took, and people were warned beforehand.

The reason why you don&#39;t get bitten by mosquitos but Marzia does is because a woman&#39;s body is a little bit warmer than a man&#39;s body, so when a man and a woman are together in the same room mosquitos will be most likely to go after the woman

Pewdiepie the us bombed them twice because the Japanese forgot literally to there last breath because it was dishonorable not to we also threatened to do it and the didn&#39;t surrender and then we the first one and they still wouldn&#39;t surrender then we bombed them a second time and the emperor or whatever it was call finally decided to surrender even though no of his advisors or warlords wanted him to.
Japan refused to surrender, thus America bombed them again.
Pog
And they told me plague doctor was a bad profession<br>Me in 2020....
If the US did’nt bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the war would probably last much longer and even more people would die, but they did’nt need to do i twice
Pewds: “yesterday, i was <b>driving</b> marzia”<br>Me: oka- wait what?
We did it twice cuz they didn&#39;t surrender

As an American I know the reason we bombed the islands it’s because are country is fucking insane like even are generally sane people are insane at times look at cnn
The reason we bombed the city’s is because when we told Japan’s government to surrender or we would bomb they said no so we boned one and then they still insisted on saying no so we hit them again sorry but you gotta do what you gotta do.

They were not entirely civilian cities and they made strategic sense. Hiroshima was choosen for multiple reasons such as having a large military complex, important port, submarine base, 5th Division Headquarters Airport, 2nd Army General Command commanding the defense of western Japan and more. The city of Nagasaki was one of the largest seaports in southern Japan and in the form of great war importance due to its extensive industrial activity, including the production of armaments, ships, military equipment and other war materials.

Not to start any fights or hurt any feelings, but America bombed Japan after pearl harbor because we were neutral until they decided to bomb a major port. America basically said don&#39;t fuck with us.

The US and the rest of the western powers made landings after landings on the japanese islands. After Iwo Jima and Saipan (older teritories of the japanese empire) they made this big plan reaching the Japanese mainland from the south<br>And the Soviet Union atacking from the north. But if that plan would have failed the loss of lives would be HUGE. But in the last minutes the president of the US, Truman find out that Scintists worked at project named A-Bomb. After some metings to force Japan surrender (and scare the Soviet Union) they dropped the nukes and the war finaly ended

The alternative for the nuclear bombs in WW2 was the US attacking the main land Japan and losing thousands of men before eventually the US would defeat Japan cause even more Japanese deaths then the bombing because the Japanese believed that the most honorable thing to do is to die in battle. The atomic bombing saved more lives then it toke.

@Pewdiepie Unfortunately regarding the nuclear bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki you are missing something.<br>The world had had enough of war, except the Japanese. The Americans warned the Japanese that they would use the bomb on them, but the Japanese refused to surrender... So they did it.<br>Afterwards the Americans were sure the Japanese would surrender, but they didn&#39;t. Not because it wasn&#39;t devastating, but because the opinion in the Japanese leadership was akin to:<br>&quot;Bet they can&#39;t do it again&quot;... The Americans could do it again. After that they surrendered. Also, the bombs were dropped on military targets, but the area of destruction reached far.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6nnYaUjeqw&amp;t=750">12:30</a> The US dropped to bombs on Japan because Japan refused to surrender after the bombing of Hiroshima, and their were still many in the command structure that wanted to fight on even after that. It toom the emporer to convince them that enough was enough. The bombings did save live, the highest estimate for casaulties from both bombings was ~250,000. Estimates for operation Downfall(incasion of Japanese mainalnd)  vary widely since it never happened and every general had political motivations that colored their estimates but I think the most believable figure I&#39;ve seen is around 5-10 million Japanese civilians

The USA bomb them twice because they had been fire bombing for months and the Japanese didn’t surrender if the USA would’ve invaded Japan it would’ve caused millions more lives from the allies and civilians. The USA bombed them a second time cause they didn’t surrender. And the USA president died while they where planning what to do so the Vice President took control and just decided to bomb them.

Hey Pewds! Not sure if anyone has answered this yet, but here&#39;s why the U.S.A. bombed them.<br><br>Hiroshima, the first nuclear bombed city, was a Japanese military and industrial city, thus being a key strategic location. The B-29 Heavy Bomber <i>Enola Gay</i> dropped the Little Boy nuclear weapon, destroying most of the city. Its destruction however, did not cause the Japanese to surrender, and thus at a later date, and after many warnings about more destruction coming, the second location was bombed.<br><br>Nagasaki was not the original location for the second bomb. That title belongs to the city of Kokura. As they flew overhead however, they decided to pick a new alternative target, (Nagasaki,) because the city was covered in clouds and smoke due to a recent bombing by 224 B-29 bombers. Nagasaki was later bombed by the B-29 Heavy Bomber <i>Bockscar</i> dropped the Fat Man nuclear weapon. Japan surrendered, and the war was over.
The reason he&#39;s never bitten by mosquitoes is because Marzia is Italian I have to go through the pain of my heritage everyday. My blood must taste like garlic pasta

They bombed Japan twice cause they didnt give up after the first one
Don&#39;t like spiders? Get a cat. They&#39;re bloodthirsty killing machines. I haven&#39;t seen a live bug inside my house in years.
Pearl Harbor was a military Harbor but they also killed many many civilians

Pearl harbour is a military base but many Civilians and soldiers died. After the first nuke the general didn&#39;t surrender so the US sent another. There was no other way

There were two bombs because they didn&#39;t surrender because they couldn&#39;t believe a single bomb could destroy a whole city so they sent another one
It’s 2020, did that guy get a girlfriend?
Pëwdiepie
hey
Pewds: Why did you bomb Japan? They were civilian cities?<br><br>The Japanese Emperor during the Rape of Nanking: 👀 nothing to see here...
Hey, the atom bombs were an atrocity. You&#39;re right.
imagine having a great day and suddenly you hear pewdiepie yell &#39;nice ass, dumbass&#39; at you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6nnYaUjeqw&amp;t=119">1:59</a> he was driving a marzia.
Pewds: why are they so many spiders in the uk <br><br>Australians: 🗿
Can someone help me with the Peter Pan one? I’m confused
The Japanese wouldn&#39;t surrender and it would have cost to much to keep the war going and after the first they still wouldn&#39;t surrender.
They dropped the 2nd nuke because Japan wasn&#39;t surrendering after the 1st
Lol my comment is on top of the one that has 12k likes and a heart from pewdiepie isn&#39;t that epic gamer moment
I JUST NOTICED, FELIX IS WEARING A DANTDM HOOD
all mosquitos are simps and that’s why they didn’t go after you
America bombed Japan twice because after the first one they still didn’t agree to an unconditional surrender, so the US dropped another bomb. Japan surrendered after the second bomb.
Pewdiepie: “I’ve never been bit by bugs”<br>Me: <b>literally can’t walk because of how swollen my ankles are from bug bites</b>
Gustav Adolf: u know Nothing about war am i a joke to u?
Wait till he finds r/noahgettheboat
Pearl harbor was a military based ambushed while we were neutral sure.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki were by some accounts civilian but they still produced things necessary for the Japanese war effort, as for why did we do it twice?  We offered them surrender they said no, bomb 1.  We then offered surrender again they said no, bomb 2.  We offered surrender again they said yes.  You can debate the morality and necessity of the actions till the end of time, it happened, it worked, and a war where millions died was ended.
&quot;I was driving marzia&quot; thats wrong you can say riding actually.....
Dang that’s cursed
I’m making eye contact with him while I’m shitting stop looking at the camera

Well problem sloved than, pewds likes &quot;cream&quot; on his gfuel.
The US bombed japan first because the bomb was finally finished and they wanted to see if it works and after that they expected japan to surrender, but they didn’t so the United States dropped a bigger and better one. After that japan was all like O FUC OK I DONT WANT DIE.<br>(I am not the best source of information tho)
Peal harbor is not a military base
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6nnYaUjeqw&amp;t=138">2:18</a> 😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6nnYaUjeqw&amp;t=745">12:25</a> No they don&#39;t need to bomb the cities. They could&#39;ve just invade the country. After all, it&#39;s the soldiers&#39; job to fight and die.

The citys were mitlitary cities that is why they bomb them.
the reason that the U.S. droped two bomb instead of one is because japn did not surrender after the first one

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6nnYaUjeqw&amp;t=752">12:32</a> allegedly the amount of civilian/japanese soldiers/ american soldiers would have been even greater if we had done a regular invasion. i don&#39;t know if that was true or not though looking at previous battle casualties on Japanese soil compared to both bombings combined it seems about right
Both cities were locations of military goods factories. So they bombed the factories who produced the guns, ammo, bombs, planes, etc.

I just realize how much editing went into this video, Amazing
They bombed 2 city&#39;s because Japan was about to surrender to the soviet union and wanted to have more control over peace talks and to flex on the union
We got ant problem at home too, and i started to be friends with them. Im giving them bread and sometimes hold them ın my hand. They&#39;re like my pets now. Cuz when i go to outside, other outside ant trying to bite me but the ones at home never. They actually love me,.. I think.
Hiroshima had a military base, and Nagasaki had several commercial steel factories and shipyards which were being repurposed by the Japanese military for Naval use.
Help me out y’all
What is the music in the background? This isnt lord of the rings x)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6nnYaUjeqw&amp;t=762">12:42</a> Pewds, they were supposed to bomb the capital instead of Nagasaki. The reason is because of the weather (more like clouds)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6nnYaUjeqw&amp;t=743">12:23</a> ....wow.  i must be an ignorant american.  i didnt realize that..... japan bombed a u.s military base, and the u.s responded by bombing two civilian japanese cities??  is that right??? it sounds so strange to say it that way.  that sure isnt how they teach us here

Pewds: &quot;I don&#39;t understand war, I&#39;m Swedish&quot;.<br>Viking Ancestors: &quot;SHAME&quot;
I’m not completely sure but I think what happened is that Hiroshima which was the first city to get hit by the Nuke was a test to see how much damage and it was a good opportunity to get revenge for Pearl Harbor. Then I think the U.S. and the Japanese were in combat against each other and the Japanese were relentless, so we nuked them again in Nagasaki to give them one last chance to give up

goddammit that story about marzia not letting you yell out the window has been too relatable in every way too many times I really feel that
i get that they would have bombed civilian cities, but the Japanese civilians were so brainwashed that they would rather die than to be in AMericas control so on the islands that they fought for, civilians were committing suicide all ove rthe place to the nuking of Japan saved more lives than it list.

Pardon me but what the fuck is an A-postroph
Omg I got a pewdiepie merch ad before this
They bombed it because if the us military had to go to Japan to take out troops they didn’t want to shoot a civilian on accident. Most people think that they saved more live by using the bomb.
I don&#39;t know if anybody will even read this, but the second bombing in Japan by USA was actually a bit of an accident. A plane holding the atom bomb was not intending to drop the bomb, but it got deserted or something and it was running low on fuel, and the bomb (nicknamed Fat Man, or something like that) was heavy af. So, the pilots were like &#39;Ay, screw all this. We need to get home or we&#39;ll die&#39;. And so, they dropped the bomb and flew away. I may be wrong at some points, but I watched a documentary on it ages ago. (got inspired to write this after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6nnYaUjeqw&amp;t=745">12:25</a> ).
Did Lou get a girlfriend though?
To explain the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after Germany’s defeat: The way the president saw it we had 2 options<br>1. Full out invasion.<br>2. Bomb major cities until the Japanese government conceded.<br>A full out invasion would have an estimated 600,00 civilian casualties, and the bomb engineers made the bomb less radioactive and explode in the air as to hurt as few people as possible and not poison their crops.
