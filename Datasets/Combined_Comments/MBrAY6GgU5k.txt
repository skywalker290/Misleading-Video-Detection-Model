This is best acting ever done by akshay kumar
No one can sing this song in hindi except kailaash kher sir hats off 🥶🥶
Kailash khair vocals 😢😢❤❤
in movie aksahay kumar is a real hero
Hello
Who says khalish sir was great voice any field 😢😢😢😢😢❤❤
Kailash ruined the song I think. Better AR or Sonu sing this gem in hindi.
Pakshiraj Real Hero of the movie
Robot is the best movie but 2.0 not satisfied..
😂😂😂😂😂 365 dinon mein se Apne dharmik parv ke liye Jo kuchh din tak apna mans machhali murga Bakri nahin khate aur FIR uske bad Jaise hi parv to har khatm hota hai vaise hi daba kar murga khane wale pakshiyon se pyar kar rahe Hain sirf dikhawa ka liya
पंछियों को।मारने में सरकार वैज्ञानिक नेता अभिनेता उद्योगपति सब सामिल हैं
Kailash kher....like

BASTARD humanity, BASTARD humanity, BASTARD humanity!
Pakshiranjan from Robot 2.0 was absolutely right,<br>Thanos from Avengers was absolutely right,<br>humans are the bloodiest species ever existed in this world, in order for MOTHER NATURE to thrive, they need to be dead! That&#39;s why I feel an enormous amount of joy whenever I see human misery 🌚❤️

Hariharan sr is best choice for singing.. kailash kher is not gud singer..
Hearing to this song after hearing the original Pullinangal song in Tamil many times. <br>Quite good in hindi as well.

Akshay Kumar real hero
So best movie yarr. Akshay Kumar
Thamizhanin Perumai 💕 Rahman 💕
Good song 👌
This song very good😍😍😍😍😍
Who know the real name of pakshiranjan(salim ali bird man) why people unlike this video?
yaar log is vidio ko dislike kaise kar sakte hain
नाइस,सोग
Akshay kumar justified his role as Pakshirajan ,with nice Msg. to save Birds and nature 👍
आई सपोर्ट पक्षीराजन
people commenting from their phone and saying &quot;save birds&quot;
This film shows our future ;i.e; how 5g,6g...so on will destory our India?
Arnold Schwarzengger was offered the role of Pakshirajan but he demanded 100cr later it went to Akshay kumar<br><br>But, even Arnold could not match Akshay&#39;s level of acting in the movie, gifted actor of Indian cinemas 😍😍😍😍
Dislikes are from the smartphones manufacturing companies
❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing song
Soul ful voice
😂😂
Nice
This song lyrics was written perfectly in telugu &amp; tamil but this song is sung soooo beautifully in telugu by M.M.KEERAVANI(M.M.KREEM) it might bcoz vast his experience in singing &amp; himself a great music director.. unfortunately in hindi lyrics lacked if not it would also a great song but the way sung by kailash kher ji was so beautiful..
Message from this movie  is absolutely correct for human beings because as our science is moving ahead, our living creatures are losing and after 10-15 years we will realise that what mistakes we have done.
Tiny little being,<br>O tiny little being,<br>May you sing your songs forever.<br>Lovely little birdie,<br>O lovely little birdie,<br>This is my only prayer to God.<br>No limits in the world,<br>No borders in the world,<br>Can stop you, innocent bird.<br>Your sky is limitless without borders and boundaries.<br>Every leaf of every branch is yours.<br>You adore the entire world with your melifluous voice.<br>My heart wants to fly with you, dear birds.<br>My heart wants to fly with you, dear birds.<br>Take me on your wings,<br>Let&#39;s go away.<br>Let&#39;s go away from this land.
Pakshirajan Crying Sence Make Me Crying
Best song of mans an birds
Yes it&#39;s is good
Why need 5g😭
Movie name pls
Akshay Kumar best Villain dangerous Villain
Kelash kher super
Love animals 🥰🥰
Dislike wale insaan nhi jannwar hai
This is biology of birds
There is No Scientific Proof That Birds Die form Mobile Tower Radiation.
People are busy with Dilvar Dilvar while this song deserves more love
Why this beautiful song have less views compared to those scrap songs in Bollywood have more than 1 billion views 😪
Akshay was best to portray prime minister Modi instead of vivek oberoi 😂
Sach m hm hi villian h pakshi Rajan nhi hme birds k baare m sochna chahiye
Super song
Akshay was right in the film but no one has right to kill anyone if it&#39;s Animals ,birds, insect or humans we
so cute Birds
Kata ni bata ni tumne ye asam 😍😍 epic lyrics
Nice song
I watched this movie in multiplex in 3D with family<br>In interval😭
I had this song and my tears come 🥲🥺...... No need 5G..... We r happy in 2G.   (2G is called 4G right now)
Birds love you
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Love from Tamil Nadu to Akshay Kumar sir.
Destroy google and americas smartphone
here is akshay who played 70-80 yrs  old guy when he was 50 while our sultan and king of bollywood[not for me] still dance around trees and  still called versatile , god save the sick mind of such people .
Basically Akshay Kumar is the hero of this movie
If you think this movie is worst then you are worst not movie....
It is inspired by Mr salim Ali khan
Don’t forget the legend AR REHMAN💕💕💕💕💕
Akshay Sir&#39;s character made me cry😢
this is the first time I loved the villain more then the hero  love you akshay sir 👍👍👍
I love birds 💗
Nature peace better that electronic gadget
This is true that is we have to so it is important that birds should live
Wow 5G ko ruko
We will save bird
Why I feel good when pakshiraja started killing people using phones....😐
Thanks corona virus for taking revenge kindly take more big revenge kill more humans pls
Only tamilnadu fans of Akshay sir like here👍
Falling in love with his every character day by day ❤️
5g tower 🗼 testing
Wow my fav movie
Hats off Akshay Kumar , A.R. Rahman, Kailash  Kher , Abbas Tyrewala , Shankar &amp; Nirav Shah (cinematographer ) 🔥❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Aaj ke halat bi yhi ho rha he phele panchi Mr rhete oxygen nhi mili to or aaj insan Mr rhe he
ab 5g birds ko pareshan karne aa gaya hai
Very nice <a href="http://song.love/">song.love</a> it so much ...😘
Super🔥🔥
Nature ne apna badla le hi liya <br>Corona ko bhej kar
a film way ahead of time...... but nowadays audiences prefer romantic movies than this movies....... shame on us
Akshay Kumar acting as old man was so natural and convincing. Such a great &amp; versitile actor. Unfortunately he can&#39;t be considered as a king of Bollywood, because only &#39;Khans&#39; with their pathetic &amp; uninspiring acting skills can become Kings in the corrupt Bollywood.<br>But always Akshay Kumar is Real Don &amp; King of Bollywood.
AR Rahman ❤️
we humans deserve viruses like Corona 😅
Birds..
u guys don&#39;t deserve  this kind of music vocal and cinematography go and watch shit like tonny kakkar
A Pain in his Voice 😭
Woww so bufeatiful song
This is true hame only movie ke bahane say nahi par ya Sach hai Ki bird&#39;s ko mobile range say desies hote hai ya unki deaths hoti hai we save birds birds🦆🦆🦅🦅🦉🦉
The real hero of this film was Pakshiraja, not chitti❤️❤️
Hum Manusshya K Naam Pe Dhappa hay.😔😔
This world is for all the living and non-living organisms.
Nice song
I literally thought about birds since I watch this movie still I&#39;m think so I play this song 🎵<br>Just imagine what will happened with birds after 10-15 years when all network become close and we get data from satellite 🥺😭😭😭😭
A r Rahman magic touch
We are busy in now a day take carry of animals
Do we really need 5g?<br>We are just thinking of the speeds and data..<br>But how the n/w and bands will impact the birds...no one is thinking about that..
Such a beautiful song ❤️❤️
This is getting up my mindddd!..<br>🤩❤️
Any super star fan here
Dil bhaar aata h<br>What a soulful voice❣️my all time fav KK( kailas kher)🙏
When rahman start singing💯🥰. It take into another world🥰👌💯

Sanjay
Salim Ali♥️
He was innocent
Salute to S.Shankar<br>Love this story<br>😔😔feeling guilty after seeing this movie
Pacchi hi nhi animals ko bhi bachana hamara farz h
Akshay kumar ji ka character sabse achha h
This. Is true love
दिल छू लिया इस गीत ने । सच में ।
Kailash kher voice is amazing
Heart touching song
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBrAY6GgU5k&amp;t=129">2:09</a> minute of goosebumps..
Kiya aaj 🐦 bird hai nahi hai bhi thodi shi kiyu why? <br>Mai batata hu mobile ki vjha shai <br>Dead ho rahi hai  kon kon meri batt Shai shemat hai 😭 save bird save bird 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I cried after watching this movie.this conveys very important message for human being.we need to  raise public awareness to save birds.they r getting extinct everyday very cruelly by human and latest technology.that why we r having too much of climate changes every year. I dont know maybe in near future we also will die bcz of technology,rediations now a days,ppl dies in such an early age,I know wt will with generations.Allah knows the best.
Save birds🐦 save birds 🐦
agar thanos sahi he,pakshi rajan bhi sahi he.apni pyari dharti ke liye.
Wow, it&#39;s Heartouching song
Is gaane ko tv per laao
Song is the best
But Something Is Off In This Version. Tamil Version Gives Goosebumps. Sry If I Have Offended Anyone. It&#39;s Just My Opinion That&#39;s It..
Not only birds we are killing all animals even knowing that they also have life and emotions plz don’t kill or torture animals
Kailash Kher has amazing voice
If u see this movie and u are crying or emotional than tell me by giving me like
I like this song
This voice is not giving that  cinematic dramatic punch  to the song
The birds seem to have adapted quite well to me. I see red-tailed hawks and scissor-tailed flycatchers roosting right on top of cell phone and electrical towers and grids, and seem to be thriving. Life seems to have a tenacity and capacity to adapt unlike any other.
❤️
In 2050 people gonna regret by watching this more
The Tamil version of the song is just a master piece
I am the worst human..i am sorry pakshi raj..i am so sorry..😥😭
Kailash khair ka naaam bhi likh dete to kya ho jata .
people who say they should cut the cell phone towers and help birds but burst loud crackers and fireworks on Diwali. What a hypocrite  they are...
Save bird save tree and save the world 🙏🙏🙏
Sunny
My fevourite <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23akshaya">#Akshaya</a> sir I love you sir

The vibrations of mobile phones really bother the birds.
This movie is great. It also tries to say that birds have a right to life
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBrAY6GgU5k&amp;t=69">1:09</a> best part
Goosebumps...great song , divine music by the god of music AR Rahman , amazing cinematography , amazing presentation , of this sequence I&#39;m talking about and all the sequences of past life of Akshay Kumar... sahi mein mujhe rona aa gaya tha jab Akshay Kumar ki baat koi nahi sun raha tha aur jab wo protest kar raha tha tab use dhakke mare gaye , jab wo roya
❤❤❤❤
Watching only because of Akshay Kumar otherwise I am also hater of <br>This production

We demand a movie with diff ending this time..where ppl find alternative solutn and listen to Akshay kumar
I liked the villain character in this movie..I would have been happy if he had won at the end
Only Akshay Kumar&#39;s story is watchable in this movie
The one and only movie where Rajni sir is sidelined..great screen presence and acting  by Akshay sir
AR Rhaman brader nice song
<b>Heart</b> <b>Touching</b> <b>Beautiful</b> <b>Song</b>  🎶
I had tears watching this scene.
Back Ground Music is most beautiful ❤️ ❣️
Stop killing birds and animals like chicken, goat,pig, cow
Stop eating chicken
Akshay  gunda ka  piksar  Rhea  cakrobarty  gundi  dekhega  or salman  sahid  or sarukh budha   mahesh budha  karan  kutta  log  dekhega.
,kya irony hai jo budda hai use jaaan aur jo jawaan hai use budaa bana diya
I could not find in you tube
I&#39;m Feeling proud to be Ornithologist.
No one praising kailash kher,who sang this song.
Kyword
Song is blissful, but thought of why the world&#39;s most populous bird in the world was ignored in the video. The bird is Chicken🐔🐣🐤🍗
I am speechless
South industry is best industry than bollywood please like

Ye puri dharti insan ki nahi hai ispar sab ka. Hak hai.
this song sung by kailasa kher <br>hit like right or wring
I&#39;m daily morning watching I&#39;m feel relaxed 😌😥
Rahman is god of music....can any other music director create this kind of song ans the kind of music...just listen to this song in headphones or earphones aand try to listen each sound you find layers arranged very well ans you also hear lot of bird sounds.....pigeon sounds especially
What do you learn from doctor pakshiraj nature is useless and donot try to remind people or you may be killed.
It was awesome experience in theater when this song came on big screen
I like song
Very nice song
Very nice song
We humans are virus.
The song has a deep message
Current issue brought me here
This Movie Thought Us That We Should Care Birds and Not Treat Them Bad Because They Are Also A Living Thing Like Us.<br><br>After Seeing This Movie Then Also We Didn&#39;t Cared Then We Should Be Ashamed
Yes 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😢😢
it must dedicate to salim ali
yeh ek sach hai ki agar pakshi  nahi rahe to hum na rahe hume itna cell phone ka istamal  nahi karna chahiye
Chitti is not real hero of 2.o
Akshay kumar is the real hero of 2.o
Please save birds <br>Please reduse radition
One of the underrated song, this should be on trending♥️♥️ crona is another form of pakshiraj
😍❤️
Song is really very hurtful
Akshay Kumar one of the best actor in Bollywood
Shankar vision n imagination + ARR magical music+ Akshay= this song is a GEM

Ye gana westorn touch vocal se gawaya hota to jayada achaa sound karta kyoki musoc westorn he ..example arman malik <br><br>Etc
Dukh wali Baat ye he ki Bharat me content wali movie piche reh jati hen sirf is liye ki bharat ke log hi inhe Pasand ni krte
6th April 2020..magical Kailash Kher song  another AR Rahman&#39;s masterpiece.
I don&#39;t know why I am crying...
Don&#39;t kill birds.. Especially bats
Pakshirajan is real hero not chitti
Bhai jinho ne bhi positive comments kiya hai woh sab sasure apne cellphone se hi kiye hai hum villain hai nahi balki villain banne par majboor hai kyuki aage hume zyada towers aur zyada frequencies ki zarurat padegi kyuki 4G se bhi log satisfied nahi hai😁
Aksay kumar is nice
Good
Corona is also a reason
Whenever I watch this video my eyes are wetty

It was awesome song
Sad to see people not watch these wonderful song less views 😭
No punjabi song compare this music
This song written by the great man Na.Muthukumar ( Tamilnadu ).(( Rip sir....)) Ur lyrics  spread everywhere like a Air
Kitni bhi acchi motivative movie bna do logo ki soch ko kbhi nhi bdla jaa skta..... Sex scenes walo songs ko 500 millions views ho jate hai aur ye video ko 1 sal ke upper ho gya tb bhi only 5.5 million views hai 😡😡

2.0 is best movie 😍😍😍😍 best story
Dis like persons died soon
Save birdsss...............
But what killing the birds is entirely not cellular network....its a minor factor....the main cause is usage of fertilizers in the farm lands which not even killing birds but also humans......so go organic guys.....
India need this types of movie
Akshay kumar is a Hypocrite.<br>He &amp; amitabh bachchan supported to cutting of Aarey forest while many bollywood actors &amp; actresses spoke against this. I request to all my brothers &amp;   sisters to boycott his films because in films he pretend himself a patriot &amp; social human while in real life he support defforestation.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23savetrees">#SaveTrees</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23aareyforest">#AareyForest</a>
Akshay Kumar<br>Hypocracy ki bhi sima hoti he<br><br>*Save Aarey
What an acting by Akshay
kilash kher voice not suitable for this song ,in telugu its more beutiful

Akshay sir you are hero of the film you did right
It&#39;s huge problem,we should definitely save birds!this movie and it&#39;s concept is so touchy ❤I feel so bad for those poor  birds...please save them🙏
ess film main akshey winner hai usko marna nhi chahiye tha he is right we must save birds
This movie gives us a heart touching moral that for the sake of other innocent creatures we should reduce the usage of mobile phones. But even in reality the telecom authority has written a letter to the film certification board that the message conveyed by this movie is fictional. The network operators keep increasing the number of towers in competition with other operators and say that we asked for network availability in rural areas. It is true that network availability is required in rural areas but we never look at the huge number of towers in urban areas. There are more than the required number of towers in a particular area. Hence we all should do the best from our sides to save birds by ending the overuse of mobile phones and also by providing water and some left over food to the few birds in our surroundings
This is best song
Supar hit song n supar a r rhman
Aksha is right
Coment mat karo yaar hum sabhi ke pass mobile he hi

Vigyan ko tabah karna pathega charles darwin bura tha ishayiat buri ha islam bura ha sarey dharm bura ha jattibad bura ha nastiq bano ya madarchod allah ko chotho sur vigyan ko apnao

God&#39;s best creation is man we have the knowledge and power to create or destroy it is our responsibility to look after each other avoid violence and take care of other species, instead of spreading violence spread peace, justice and love. Always remember that with great power there must also come great responsibility.<br>This movie was awesome, this would be in my top superhero movies.
sounds worst when compared  to telugu and tamil... kailesh kher voice is not apt for this....
Ye song movies ko boring karata h..... bakwas song h....
Super cool song and supreme song

इस फिल्म में जो पंछी राज सभी देशवासियों को ज्यादा नेट यूज़ करने पर रेडिएशन फैलाने की जो बात करते हैं वह सच मे है अगर हम सब मिलकर कब से कम नेट का यूज करेंगे तो कहीं ना कहीं हमारे देश के बहुत तेजी से विलुप्त होते पंछी बच  जाएगे
