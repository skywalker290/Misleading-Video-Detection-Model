That&#39;s how Lily&#39;s Garden works
STILL GOATED,  MY MIDDLE NAME ENDED UP BEING SOME FORM OF LILLY HAHA
The way he said Family took me out 😂😂😂😂
Im so sorry on behalf of my country
😢do that he gotta get wacked
Dorine is my mom&#39;s name
I love it
9+…<br>This is an e10+ game. Yep
This video traumatized me for 2 days at the past lol
That&#39;s how mafia works
It is a shame felix did not watch these in chronological order to properly digest the lily&#39;s garden lore. Alas, that just how it be on this beach of an earth.
The game is fun. I like it.
These stupid matching games…they’re so dumb and they think they can hook you with these dumb stories and drama…I don’t know what’s sadder, the content? Or the fact that we fall for it?
‌
Developer: lemme make an ads<br>Ads:
If anyone is interested in these ads for Lilly’s garden bijuu Mike did a whole series
GET-A-LIFE-GAY -GUY DO YOU KNOW HOW RIDICULOUS YOU SOUND SITTING THERE JUDGING A GARDEN GAME - WHAT A FKG WEIRDO ……
Pewds: &quot;who cares&quot;<br>Matpat: loooooooorrrrreeeeee!!!!!
Maybe Susan had childhood trauma of people making fun of her teeth
I hate Lilly&#39;s garden and her smile
theres a whole storyline and damn its confusing as hell (Game Theory made a video trying to figure out the lore and storyline just search lily&#39;s garden game theory timeline)
Damm 2 years gone by already
Look into Merge mansion. There’s so much lore and they’re using Kathy Bates in their live action ads. It’s too good
Lily&#39;s garden is like a soap opera 😂🤣
The title alone ended me 🤣
Don’t say Jesus Christ name in a bad way
Thank god i did not experience this<br>My first time seeing this ads<br><br>I mostly dont get ads cause i play gacha games like OP the Strongest,OnePieceTreasureCruise,IllusionConnect,EpicSeven

Its funny how mobile ads are basically allowed to false advertise<br><br>Showing one thing in the ads then if you play its literally nothing like the ad
🖼
What you never played tuber simulator
Man, at least the ads were finished. Now there is just a simple style to every add I see, little stick figures. I don’t want little stick figure
I played it before the.shitty adds it was kinda fun
Hell nah I ain&#39;t , playing this game
Was it ever confirmed she&#39;s the one named Lilly?
Pewdiepie I saw many videos on tiktok about your song (Bitch lasanga) and your song got popular on tiktok and everyone they using your song :3

<b>I feel like Lily’s “garden” is supposed to be her BUSH.</b>
What he doesn’t get is NONE OF THIS HAPPENS IN THE GAME, The ads are bullshit lmao
my grandmother dislikes the vid
the sam’o’nella videos
Spotted Red Letter Media in Pewds recommended videos. 😍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=274">4:34</a> you can not tell me this is allowed and convince me<br>Edit) I just realized this is here massaging her entire body not just that part but pewdiepie convinced me it was that
Lily had an abortion D:
I literally had a shitty game ad before this vid ;0
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=578">9:38</a> if i learn to animate like that ima make someone hang lily above a fire and leave her there
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=407">6:47</a> imagine a game rated 4+ and the ads is inside a stripe club lol
I love how he just roasts her ✊👀
i secretly think lily is my roblox gf
I have been complaining about this to anyone and everyone for almost a year now!! Those ads are horrible and I don&#39;t know what the advertising team are thinking with the majority of these ads. They suck.
Lily’s Garden has lore kinda
Apple : Bans Fortnite<br><br>Also Apple : Doesn&#39;t ban This game...
Pewds: ok things are happening but why<br><br>Me:cause thats how mafia works
My name’s Lily and I’m ashamed.
Лучшее расследование этого века
bro lily&#39;s garden is her <b>******</b>
Love the fact that Felix watches sam o Nella academy
How could my home contry do this
All jokes aside, this oversexualisation is not helping us, nor our children. Look how everyone is obsessed with sexual objectification now. What kind of message that sends? Don&#39;t get me wrong, I no saint, but bit things are going extreme these days. We will continue to objectify people until we change these things. Everything starts at little things. And people should care.
Pewdipe there&#39;s a theory video made by the game theorists aka matpat.
After game theory
The disgusting meme written all over my face
The game itself is good, I’ve been playing it for a long time and I dont watch the ads but  I do enjoy the game, and the story line is cute besides the ads. But my middle name is Lily so that’s why I got it at first. still, I’m glad this got recommended this now out of no where. I love pewds and have been watching him for 10+yrs but I do actually like the game as it is but I agree the ads are major shit btw the ads are nothing compared to the story line in the game lol<br>I play solitaire and two dots more than I play this game but it is top,three<br>I’m nota Karen I’m just drunk lol sorry 😂😂
they should fuck the game and make it a series
Cant we just return to Angry birds and clash of clans
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=56">0:56</a> my homie outa there

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=560">9:20</a> Pewds be like: &quot;Ah, yes, lets sexualise cats&quot;
Omg Pewds needs to look at those app games that&#39;s called fashion something that always ends in a fuckup

As a somewhat Danish guy, I beg your pardon for what my fellow danish people did.
Does anyone know where I can find a shirt like the one he wears in the Pixelings outro? It looks super cool!
What if you wanted to go to heaven but god said play now
She wanted to get rid of him
That&#39;s why
She slapped her while they were still together
I think the ex-cheating came first then followed up by her faking prego to get rid of him. So the slap is justified :)
Lilys divorce
I love how Sive managed to fit an entire essay about the history of oil and it&#39;s potential uses in two seconds
Yoshikage Kira as Blaine

Does Lily not have any other clothes????
WATCH DANI
<b>h3nt41</b>
ik im late but am i one of the few people who never got this ad? i usually see genshin, ragnarok, or mobile legends
These ads are a disgrace to those who are actually named Lily. U have no idea how uncomfortable it makes me to hear my name for these kind of ads-
Watching this for a second is terrorizing because of the ads
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=11">0:11</a>

I like how the yellow text for Star Wars is just the Wikipedia for motor oil lol
The blonde hair dude in the ads looks frickin like Jojo
You Singled Out Her <b>Teeth</b> ?<br>Very Reasonability
doesn&#39;t it seem everyone whos name is or is close to lily is a monster?
On behalf of all of Denmark, we would like to apologize...
Lilly is dump
It&#39;s fast-acting detergent.. so it&#39;s Det-Urgent.. I guess?
Lily&#39;s garden is like every Romcom ever that has a twist that doesn&#39;t make since even after they explained it

Anyone else notice Felix has two RedLetterMedia videos in his recommendations? Is it too good to be true that he&#39;s a fan of those hack frauds?
I saw a T-series ad at the start of the video
Me: is named lily*<br>I am extremely uncomfortable with this video
How dare those ads make fun of my name
same
Bad mobile ads everyone speeks like owww woollooooooow a libil fifff geaaa omy good todee weea goner feet a libel fishy oppnint
i’ve watched this video so many times over the last year
Plot twist he did get demonetized for the teeth-shaming
Youtube recommended works in mysterious ways
Just got back from watching all the ads which was thirty minutes long, wow, the content is just wow.....<br>I recommend people give all the ads a watch.
What&#39;s the background music?
I would be so dead if I did that to my mom 🤣🤣.
F you sweden
Don&#39;t tell me that the washing machine vibrations are why she rolls her eyes.....or am I tripping.
As far as I understand, you haven&#39;t watched a Pasha Fencer commercial yet.
The mother looks like Yezma’s trying to fit in a video game.
Redlettermedia and Ricky Gervais in your suggested? I thought I was looking at my own suggested for a moment!
there was a Sam O&#39;nella academy video in Pewd&#39;s suggested videos section
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=231">3:51</a> WHAT IS THAT
The ads for that game are ridiculous lmao
S<br>H<br> I<br>T

The commercial: &quot;The new indie adventure episodic reality drama that&#39;s TOO HOT for T.V!&quot;<br><br>The game: Ha hA ! bLocKs gO BrrRrrRrrRRrRr
as a dane im actually kinda cringed out that the mail was Danish. Sorry pewds
the &#39;A bitter pill to swallow&#39; video is about drugging drinks. the ex fiance and the mother drug eachothers drinks.
Little dose he know there’s a whole expanded universe
You stole from Peter Knetter
i miss when nintendo would give instruction booklets on the game and it had so much beautiful art in it, it was my favorite thing about getting new gamecube games, i used to have so many.. then i lost them i guess i have no idea, but now those shits are probably priceless artifacts, wish i still had them
Felix called it 12 seconds into the video-
All ads suck tbh except youtuber games it ruins  <br>Crunchyroll b
he said denmark products were bad when denmark made lego
A World War III/war game commercial popped up when the guy kissed Lily’s mother.
If they would not waste their time with a weird game they would have been rich animators.
The ad that was first shown was literally my moms pregnancy in a nutshell
Who wants to live on the earth with Lilly
Awesome
I actually saw Lily’s guarden commercial and was so confused

the ad: betrayal, incest, crazy people, pregnancy, family problems and death<br>The game: candy crush
<b>advertises mobile app in 2021</b>

One time Google put a VIBRATOR APP in the kids section 😐
Lol.. pewdiepie... you&#39;re a mood. And I hate to say it, but the ad for idle immortals is worse. It makes it look like it&#39;s an RPG type thing... but its idle... and I unlocked all the creatures within like 2 hours.
Plot twist:<br>The washing machine is the Father
“Why?”
All I want to know is.... Why is this called Lily&#39;s garden?
Word has it Blaine’s still riding to this day.
i hope she gets so pregnant, has several kids, and then can&#39;t keep them or get her exes to help her...
Honestly I’ve been addicted to the damn story and creating the garden but I hate the “game” part. I’ve been wasting hours of my life cus of the unlimited lives I get for more stars to play the story part more
I feel like 0.1% of all mobile games aren&#39;t absolute aids.
Next I have challenge it hard I can’t even do it :(<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Play Lily’s garbage <br><br><br>I mean garden

They changed that first ad for the game that was shown. The husband no longer GTFOs. He stays to help her now and looks very different too. I think they just got rid of Blaine and replaced him with Luke altogether.
Everywhere I go I still see it
I love dark humor suffer lily haha
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=217">3:37</a> even if she did pretend to be pregnant to get rid of him, that would mean the mom would be cheating on her dad
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=475">7:55</a> i am betrayed by my fatherland
I watched a compilation on every ad in order of lily&#39;s garden.  It was a rollercoaster, but I have to say that it was interesting
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=11">0:11</a> Dorime in Vocaloid
I&#39;ve seen these before and thought the same thing. It&#39;s fucking strange, man.
Why does every woman in this AD has massive body parts????
I’m playing this game right now and it’s nothing like the ads
no break: sleep<br><br>break: awoken
These are not ads,these are aids.
Me: <b>Downloads Lily&#39;s Garden For The Drama, Fun And Pregnancy.</b><br>Also Me: <b>gets frickin bejeweled</b>
Pls guys don&#39;t say Omg,Jesus Christ as a shock word pls guys 🙏
I personally like this version of pewds

The gameplay reminds me of shitscapes
Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of this video. It definitely deserves a sequel to Pewdiepie&#39;s reaction to Lilys Garden ads because even more keep popping up.
i don&#39;t like Lily
Dorime
dorime is just like friday funkin
Gardenscapes: <b>&quot;First time?&quot;</b>
This kind of ad remind me of Homescapes ad 😂 and those annoying game ads where they purposely pick the wrong option
when lily reveals that she faked the pregnancy test <br>That&#39;s how mafia works
Yes  i would love to play in lily&#39;s garden and explore even more
Yup we out 😐
Well we made lego

I hope they make an ad where Lily gets hit by a car and then the driver reverses over her already broken legs damaging them even more.
I see NTR reference ( ͡ ͡° ͜ ʖ ͡ ͡°)

My rain after I watched that video: this is how mafia works
the ads are better than the game ;-;
Wait it&#39;s all memes
September
Proper Arabfunny meme at the beginning<br><br>Very epic
My name is lily and I’m slightly uncomfortable
And you have not even seen the Dutch ads..
Got a Mobile Game Ad while watching this vid😅😅😅
Regina in indonesia was some kind of chips
2080:<br>And here, children, is Lily&#39;s Garden one of the first ocurances to trigger the end of the world.
So cringe!!!!!!!!!!
i laughed when her husband left
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=135">2:15</a> thats a lot of samonella
:0
Reminds me of Charlie
As a Danish person i will truly apologize for this mess
I’m danish and i now have a plan for immigration
The ads are more interesting than the actual game
Noo poopdie :c
I am from Denmark and i agree that this game is nut nuts, but you have to remember that, Denmark also envented hit man.
This gives out critikal vibes and i luv it
dis video is epic as hell
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=25">0:25</a> seems like a twomad edit
Can’t believe this was almost a year ago
But seriously  she looked like she peed herself on the washing machine.
Invite  my friends to sit on a washing machine and then fall in love with my neighbor great choices and then slap my mom for making out with my ex husband I am just so smart .
i am disappointed of my country
That game has the same ads that doesn&#39;t related to the game of Homescape and Gardenscapes I think. Because the game is same gardening stuffs. 😆
Wow, Felix is a wee lil&#39; bit salty than usual, <i>innit</i> huh?
pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=136">2:16</a> and it shows that Sam O&#39;Nella Academy videos are in pewd&#39;s reccomended
Ever heard of merge gun: shoot zombie
Pewds not picking up the pun for &quot;DET Urgent&quot; to now making dad jokes during Among Us is the character development I needed
I&#39;m like a 7th graders and the adverts  that I get on flipaclip are uncomfortable :(
I feel like this is false advertisement but then again I don’t know
One day my friend ate a erraser
As a Lili we do not acept her<br>Actualy im a &#39;Lili&#39; not a &#39;Lily&#39;
The pregnancy scene where lily was talking I tried to read her lips and she was saying &quot;ilk tuat&quot; LOL<br><br>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=194">3:14</a>
That&#39;s How Mafia Works!<br><br><br>If you remember you are a legend!
WAIT WHAT IT&#39;S DANISH XD HVORFOR DANMARK HVORFOR!!
Even pewdiepie agrees lol
lily&#39;s garden is CRINGE
I love this guy
But u played game
Eww. (That&#39;s disgusting.The whole. &#39;Lily&#39;s garden&#39; is disgusting.)
I didnt know such cringe could exist
THERE&#39;S NO SHAKING OF VEGANA
Top 10 best animes ever
Got a mobile ad
What a disgrace to my name wtf
how is that 10 months ago? wtf
some guy:is this before or after her pregnancy<br>me:damn
All the Lily&#39;s Garden ads actually have a YouTube channel...
You should play sky children of the light, it’s made by the same people who made Journey. It’s 👌
Monke
The ad where the guy is driving away on the scooter is the story of my life 😅
the times he was still funny
I found a copy of this ad by a norher game
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=151">2:31</a> what tf is the name of that song I hear it everywhere
olppollloolollloo
About: I make videos. Okay... I need more content..
I just got here after watching dani&#39;s video on the same topic
My mom played the game Lilly&#39;s garden and she didnt know about the ad qnd she hasn&#39;t played the game ever since she saw the ad
They should just make the game episodic or make an animated YouTube series 😂
Lily be high
My mum plays Lily&#39;s Garden... I just realised...
Lily&#39;s husband looks like yoshikage kira from jjba diu
PewDiePie oye
why is this a game
Woman pleasing herself with a washing machine, this is how you know a man did this
They actually re-did that &quot;I&#39;m pregnant!&quot; scene twice, one with Lily&#39;s female friends and one with that neighbour dude. XD<br>I&#39;ve seen the full story so far and everybody literally just cheat on everybody, it&#39;s so bizarre and it makes no sense. Also the mother dies and then returns after that? And Lily has a kid with demonic powers???
When yr name Whitney is on lily&#39;s garden why meeeee!!!
lily would make a lot of money if she had an onlyfans lmao
<b>family friendly</b><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=313">5:13</a> ye sure

This vid is random AF but I can relate 100 percent lily&#39;s garden is trash
And then there’s the commercial where Lilly kills her husband because he likes ketchup and snores
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=144">2:24</a> this make me laugh all video

Pewds: Lily&#39;s a f**king <br><b>WE&#39;LL BE RIGHT BACK...</b>
Wth did I just watch<br><br>You earned a sub
Hahahhaha
Hahaha
Why are 90% of mobile games just the same game??
Bruh what are these ads?? The memes added to these ads make it even more funnier.<br>Thanks Sive (Brad 2)
The way the guy drives away the scooter is hilarious 😂
My mother loves Lilys garden XD.
i don’t get the washing machine ad can somebody tell me what it meand
Having played the actual game [using a hacked APK to skip the bejweled knockoff and just watch the story segments/play the decorating games] I gotta say the story was kind of cute and heartwarming.
THANK YOU I HATE HER TOO
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=392">6:32</a>  lol the video got demonnetized
Next ad be like<br>What she get washing machine baby😳😳

Okej, I admit to playing this game and single mindedly paying some google minions salary. Why? Because, like all these poker machine games. They Are Addicting. Also you get to make a &quot;garden&quot;. 🙄 *face palm*... Don&#39;t be fooled either by the &quot;traditional&quot; advertising or even &quot;sexualising&quot; .. Because the game &quot;storylines&quot; are woke, woken? Fts. Game no likey boys, their germy and Conan style intelligent... Which is why I skip any story to fund the minion.... Who now apparently is my neighbour.... 🙄
Are we not gonna talk about the ones where she murders people and buries them in her garden
Game: lilys garden<br>Me: lilys garbage...

the four thousand dislikes are the game owners
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=228">3:48</a> WHAT IS THAT IN THE BACKROUND O.O
Last night I downloaded a game about texting. You&#39;d expect it to be just sending fake texts to people. But no, it also includes minigames of fixing a phone, and pulling pins so all the emojis end up in a container. Those minigames I mentioned have their own games all about their respective premise.
Omg I&#39;m dead😂😂
I hate cell phone game advertisements so bullshit much hatred
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=504">8:24</a> he’s kinda bad
When I sawed that at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=265">4:25</a>  then kept watching and what&#39;s this it&#39;s family friendly I just pursted into tears with laughter
We all know what garden she is growin and its not for 4+
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=179">2:59</a> Every woman after 2 days of dating.
Why are all the newer games just rip offs of candy crush with sims building shit for flavour<br><br><br><br>Edit: and random sex jokes and shit while being promoted as FAMILY FRIENDLY
Petition for Pewds to play Lilly&#39;s garden so we can kill it completely.
Hey your are the bested youtuber in the world you are god to me I praise you
My mom is on like level 2000 on this shitty game

It&#39;s just Homescapes but crappier... and Homescapes is already CRAPPY!
what about the ad where she legit murders her husband by smothering him
Gracias pewdipie en raccionar a este comercial 😁👌👌👌👌👌<br>Merry christmas 🐧👌👌👌👌

I feel like the creators of Lily&#39;s Garden commercials are just trolling people at this point with how ridiculous their commercials are
Pewds: &quot;Have you ever noticed how crazy things are out there?&quot;<br>Me now: 😳
I hate Lily’s garden and her teeth too

HOW IS THE GAME FAMILY FRIENDLY, THE AD&#39;S DON&#39;T LOOK FAMILY FRIENDLY.
The ad had nothing to do with the game, and it had nothing to do with a garden, I&#39;m confused.
Me: trys to find video that was on also the video<br><br>Also me: proceeds to see video right next to the video<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Im not sure this meme made sence
This is cursed
Lilypichu be crazy

i cant read coments bc im laufing too herd-hard
I got a really bad ad and thought it was part of the video.
The one kid that installed Lilly’s garden 👁👄👁
Who is watching this 6 months after it was published lmao
If she can do that with a washing machine... don’t give here a smart fridge.
That Chad that got lily pregnant did a Jojo reference
So.. not gonna lie.. this game is actually kinda fun. Roast me if you must. 😆😫
Danny Gonzalez is going to be so mad

Blaine looks like the Chad meme
The ad I saw for this game was the one where she finds out she&#39;s pregnant, tells her fiance. EXCEPT!!! It&#39;s not the blonde guy she tells it too, its they dark haired guy she tells the news to. And instead o driving off on a vespa and leaving her, and steps out for a moment, then comes back with gifts for her.

<b>moral of the story: buy washing machine if you want to feel amazing instead to have husband</b>
Wait dis game is danish o fuck I’m danish ahhhh my future is coomin
I got an ad were she freaken killed that luke guy with a pillow just because he put ketchup in his dinner and left the restroom cabin sloppy and then she upgrade her house and whatever

I like the game! And Lili’s a good character in it! The game has a history! And the Lily of the ad is not the same of Lily of the game!

Ngl i would be happy to see sexy angry birds 😳
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=136">2:16</a> can we talk about the fact PewDiePie had 2 samonella vids in his recommendations
The intro: * is weird *<br>Felix right after: so the world is getting crazier<br>Me: no shit sherlock
When you get pewds ad on pewds vid
Legends says blaine is still riding the vespa
This is not family game
Felix: Have you noticed that its gotten crazier out there<br>Me: <b>looks at date of upload</b> <br>Jan 13 2020<br>Also me: Thats just the beginning
The game is a match game with a story line. The game is g rated.  The ads.... hilarious...but the ads are PG-13.
Blaine is like a roach....he won&#39;t go away... You have to tell him to go away like 10 times in the game...and he still shows back up. Haha
The game is actually pretty cool....and addictive.
Did I just get a PewDiePie ad on a PewDiePie video? Yes I did
I got a pewds phone case ad while watching this
Scam
Ugh
<b>i got a pewdiepie ad before this, i didn&#39;t hesitate to stay</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=211">3:31</a> it&#39;s not an oopsie doopsie. It&#39;s a fakey dakey &gt;:(<br><b>*plays furious 2*</b>

I got a pewdiepie ad watching a pewdiepie video. Cool
dude, yesterday I saw an ad for a game called &quot;Clockmaker&quot; and I can&#39;t find the actual game anywhere, but the ad was like &quot;we know you&#39;re tired of match 3 games...&quot; so I was excited,  but the game was still just match 3. i got pranked. i got pranked REAL good.

Still not as bad as Lilly Singh
Me trying to pay attention to the video:<br>The mirror in the background:
Is it me or lily looks like a<br>Bootleg miss pauling from tf2?
Love getting a ad about his phone chase on a pewdiepie video
&quot;You wanna play Lily&#39;s GARDEN?&quot;
I recall having an ad for Lily&#39;s Garden in which she took a pillow and was nearly going to suffocate her ex while he was asleep at night, please cancel this game and its ads 😂
I got pewdiepie add before this video
HUUUUUUGHHGHHGHHHHHHHH
Did Felix just say “sexy angry birds”?

So this woman pretended to be pregnant to get rid of her boyfriend so she could cheat on him with a washing machine without getting in trouble<br><br><b>thats some Wattpad s**</b> <b>*right there if I’ve ever seen it</b>
DUDE EVERYTIME I SEE THAT AD WITH THE HOUR GLASS BECAUSE OF MY GRANDMA!!! SHE ALWAYS WATCHED DAYS OF OUR LIVES!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=195">3:15</a> I seen this one but the ad was cut out and she was in the hospital and randomly was at her house decorating her house
Did lily just get off on the washing machine?
I would like to provide an update: Lily and Luke do in fact have a child now. I believe the kid was born two weeks ago as of the time I am writing this.
I actually played the game, and I skipped through the intro. Never knew there was this much back story. Wouldn&#39;t have skipped it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where does the “garden” part come??<br><br><br>Or is this game just “Lily’s love life for four year olds”
So uh... where&#39;s the freaking garden???
Lily&#39;s Garden is literally the most pathetic and hateful crap I have ever seen. Even this &#39;&#39;intro&#39;&#39; they&#39;ve did for the characters is literally bad, at this point just do a actual game that looks like your fucking ads, jeez.<br>Plus the original game is a whole boring mess, and ALSO rated 4+, how they come with these stupid ads while profiting from a &#39;&#39;friendly reputation&#39;&#39; on Google Play. Honestly Google?...
I see too many Lily&#39;s ads. And I hate it
Yes I will trick my husband  that I’m pregnant and then get mad that he dated my mom and it is weird as f&amp;@k wen they sit on the dryers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=490">8:10</a> They’re not just telling stories, they’re changing lives
In the washing machine part I accidentally clicked off of youtube.
It should&#39;ve been Karen&#39;s Garden so it would rhyme. Also, she took the kids.
Pewdiepie you have to respect women
<b>I hate this god damn crappy lily&#39;s garden game</b>
Why does podipie look different here
Why didn&#39;t they just make it a YouTube series of episodes instead of having the game
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=144">2:24</a> what is the name of music

&quot;wHERE&#39;S THE PREGNANCY???&quot;
Why have I never seen these ads? I actually play this game and it&#39;s  really lame. Not at all as spicy as these ads are. I wish it did have all the betrayal and pregnancy etc.   But no, just a lame strategy game.

React to rise of kingdoms
I&#39;m here because I just watched Lily kill a man by suffocating him with a pillow. She did cry afterwards, so I guess that makes it ok?
I literally got Lily&#39;s garden ad during watching this video
Just why why
I have more subs than her TwT
As a lily I would like to change my name to a different one.
we need matpat to make a Lily&#39;s Garden timeline video
Those are the ads im getting now with rise of kingdom and lords mobile

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=155">2:35</a> ...

Play Lily’s <i>garden</i> if you know what I mean
💮💮💮💮💮🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🎌@# brofist
One day I just think of this video randomly but I remember the title as &quot;I hate Lily Teeth and her Garden&quot;
On behalf of the Lily community, WE DON&#39;T CLAIM HER
I’m starting to think they’re making their ads shit unpurpose so that youtubers will react to them and thereby give their game more attention and more potential customers. The old “all publicity is good publicity” accept theyre just making bad ads and not doing anything immorally
If you didn&#39;t notice it already blaire looks like he&#39;s holding air on the motor cycle
It’s dark web ads

In finland its &quot;joka kerta kun ruotsalaiset tekee jotain se on jotain homoa&quot;<br>Translated &quot;everytime swedes makes something its gay&quot;
Красава спс за видос, все очень понятно !
This is on par with car commercials with weird shit happen, while it has nothing to do with the car being advertised
I’ve seen the Lily’s ads a lot kinda getting annoyed by it.

This was this year! This feels so old
I watched the bitter pill to swallow ad, and it&#39;s about date rape drugs. But hey, 4+ family game!!
When i was watching i got a ad a bull driving over a bull good job youtube
Was that a Sam O’Nella video I saw in your recommendations?
lily: <i>i’m pregnant</i><br>blaine: <b>aight imma head out</b>
On behalf of the Danish 19 year old, we are sorry for what our country have done.
Pewdiepie watches Sam O&#39;Nella Academy
“Denmark is always up to no good” no wonder LEGO hurts to step on

I watched the ads for the game and there are so horrible!

Mobile ads will never stop getting worst and more annoying!

When I found out that this game was developed by a danish company, my inner dane threw up
It&#39;s basically cliakbait
She&#39;s pregnant with a dishwasher
I just realized lily&#39;s garden is a ripoff of gardenscapes which is a ripoff of candy crush
If this was about pizza, they would still be together cuz he just drove away for a pizza party<br>:b GET SOME FACTS BOII

I don’t get it
As a criminal case player I see this ad every day
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=20">0:20</a> thats equivalent to saying minecraft is cubical
Who would’ve thought that a cheap puzzle game to lead to incest, fake pregnancy, Jeremy Kyle and dr Phil material.
I think they&#39;re making more adds on lily&#39;s garden bc many people watch it
omaigoid yesh<br>Hate her

Speaking of Lily&#39;s Garden, I saw a commercial for it on t.v. I was.... Certainly not expecting it.
<b>Im pregnant</b><br><br><br><br>Husband: Aight imma head out
Yes we danes are crazy
I really dodged a bullet because my name is Lilly (it’s actually Lillian but people call me Lilly)
What&#39;s funny is that the ORIGINAL ad was that the dad came back with a baby sized shirt
&quot;It&#39;s like watching the latest Star Wars film. Ok, things are happening, but WHY?&quot; This is the best description of the new Star Wars films
WHAT HE CAN FLY? Wow this is Assisin
Who knew sitting on a washing machine can make you so powerful
It’s f*ucking cocomellon
I’m tired of raid shadow legends. I downloaded it and it wasn’t even good. The graphics are okay but the gameplay is boring.

Poor lily. I swear to god, if you don’t apologise, I will unsubscribe to you and sub TsERieS
My mom is playing Lily&#39;s garden and he is more than level 180. Disturbing
They look a bit too calm on the washing machine for a family game
Is it just me? <br>Or the Mom in Cocomelon and Lily are like the same(?)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=328">5:28</a> No, I look like I am trying to squeeze out a turd, because I am.

WTF this game is Job of satan
I hate this boring games -_-
Was that sam o nella in his recommended?
Regina means Queen in Romania
I literally saw Lily&#39;s Garden for the 1st time and got so fucked up in the head filled with anger, cringe, and laughter.
I played it before seeing the ad. The soap opera-esk ads have NOTHING to do with the game&#39;s story.
🤢 🤮
Heeej jeg er dansk
Hey I&#39;m danish
Wth. This is a kids game! Omgggg she literary. Omg. Ah.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhXSY24W2k&amp;t=308">5:08</a> was the very first ad I saw for this fucking game when I was playing Empires and Puzzles or something, and I couldn&#39;t help but be like: What the fuuuuck?? Now all I see is the pregnancy announcement with Luke.
something tells me Denmark is celling gang
Felix, I do not accept your apology. It&#39;s a fucking match 3 game which advertises Lily herself forcefully trapping a child in the dryer and turns it on to max. AND SHE SMILES, SHE THROWS UP A BIG OL&#39; GRIN WHILE THE CHILD IS MOST LIKELY CRYING FOR MERCY!<br>(Edit: AND GETTING A KINK OUT OF IT! WHAT THE FUCK?!)
