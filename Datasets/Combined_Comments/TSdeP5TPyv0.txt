Ranveer&#39;s acting was on point.👍🏻

This movie is a Classic!🥰

Only movie where we saw real Ranveer face
Perfect 👌
All the scenes of this movie❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>The acting, cast, emotions everything is fab❤️

I actually liked the movie. Makes sense, if you leave the luxury aside. Just scale down the luxury to your size and think . This is what happens. Shit happens
Mere parents bhi meri shadi aisi ladki se kar rahe the jo mujhe bilkul pasand nahi thi kyu ki Dahej achha mil raha tha...<br>Aur ladkiyo ko bhi lagta h paise de kar koi bhi ladka khareed legem
Anil Kapoor&#39;s acted the best of his career in this movie
Strange and non moral story...... useless film...I think
This really happens in big business world wife gf and wedding ko business samjhte ho really 🤣
The way Anil said “plane chahiye nhi kya tumhe” 😂😂😂 majnu bhai always rocks.
BC.....aisa to mukesh ambani bhi nhi puchta hota apne baccho se...😂😂😂plane chahiye ki nahi....😂😂😂
bhai yhe line plane chaiye ke nhi tumhe har ek maa baap ke kahani btate hai kaise wo bribe karke bacho se kaam karwalete hai
Kaash sab bachon main itne guts hote

Damn this movie was way ahead of time
They are saying plane chahiye as if they are buying some fruits
waiting Kgf chapter 2 😎
Had this movie been scripted around a chawl or a middle-class area like Sion (in Mumbai) it would still have flopped cos this movie shows the age-old patriarchy and typical yet empty family values and THAT IS THE TRUTH, and no one likes telling/hearing as it truly is. One of the most under-rated movies of the modern Bollywood
Really sad to see Indian society is still stuck t minus 50 years
Kon hai ye log kaha se ate hai ye log ..
Why this mov not available in you tube
The chemistry between Ranveer and PC in this movie is 🔥
This movie is for all those bloody blood sucker
I don&#39;t understand how is divorce such a huge deal in higher sections of society. They infact don&#39;t care much for making marriages work unnecessarily.
This movie is soo good
I can watch dis movie over n over again.such a lovely movie.n d acting done by all d actors is just awesome
Wooooo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSdeP5TPyv0&amp;t=212">3:32</a> is every indian family when a person younger than them speaks the truth
Anil Kapoor’s slanted looks towards Ranvir at the beginning were awesome. Great movie - need not one but a few sequels
Ranveer look so cute😍😍🤗☺️
Priyanka ki ek entry or game change krke chali gyi

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSdeP5TPyv0&amp;t=146">2:26</a> ooh god that expression 😂

It seems a good movie. Thinking to download it and watch it.
This is so realistic,how anil loses patience eventually and ranveer asks if they’re trying to bribe him,and shefali says in that super realistic voice “Kabir don’t be silly” god it’s amazing
Haha..plane chahiye ki nahi tunhe..oh god
