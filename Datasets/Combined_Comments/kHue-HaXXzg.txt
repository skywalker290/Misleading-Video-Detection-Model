Never liked Frozen, never liked this song. I&#39;m just so surprised it&#39;s been 10 WHOLE YEARS since the song got viral and it was everywhere. Where did the time go?
Perfect dawn, hinde doña
Was this even the girl that voiced Elsa in Frozen?? Just random people doing music videos of an Animated movie they didn&#39;t create 💀

🎶👌
I listened to this in high school. Before I graduated last year.
Yo con 6 años escuchando esta canción  que no sabia que era demi ahora tengo 16 😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
&quot;Out here in the cold, thin air, I finally can breathe... I know I left a life behind, but I&#39;m too relieved to grieve...&quot; Demi Lovato&#39;s rendition takes this Disney classic to a whole new level.
I love the message they give in this song, to always be yourself and don&#39;t charge for anyone.
Yes I am
I heard many songs and they come and go these pass 10 years and beyond. But this one song I vow to never let it go. It will always be in my heart forever.
<i>omg</i>
I watch it when i was 14 i watch it 10 times frozen 1😂😂😂😂now im 20 crazy time flies
Que buen recuerdo yendo al cine y ver la peli de frozen y siempre escuchaba a demi❤❤😢😢nostalgia

Alguém de 2024?🎉❤
Who is here in 2024
ביצוע יפה ומרגש גם עכשיו ב2024❤<br>זה דומה לביצוע של רוני דלומי במופע גאליס 2 בסוכות 2014
I’m crying from so much nostalgia of course <br>Who else is?
เนื้อเพลง Let it go<br><br>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br>Not a footprint to be seen<br>A kingdom of isolation<br>And it looks like I&#39;m the queen<br><br>The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br>Couldn&#39;t keep it in, heaven knows I tried<br>Don&#39;t let them in, don&#39;t let them see<br>Be the good girl you always have to be<br>Conceal, don&#39;t feel, don&#39;t let them know<br>Well, now they know<br><br>Let it go, let it go<br>Can&#39;t hold it back anymore<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Turn away and slam the door<br>I don&#39;t care what they&#39;re going to say<br>Let the storm rage on<br>The cold never bothered me anyway<br><br>It&#39;s funny how some distance makes everything seem small<br>And the fears that once controlled me can&#39;t get to me at all<br>It&#39;s time to see what I can do<br>To test the limits and break through<br>No right, no wrong, no rules for me<br>I&#39;m free<br><br>Let it go, let it go<br>I am one with the wind and sky<br>Let it go, let it go<br>You&#39;ll never see me cry<br>Here I stand and here I stay<br>Let the storm rage on<br><br>My power flurries through the air into the ground<br>My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br>And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br>I&#39;m never going back, the past is in the past<br><br>Let it go, let it go<br>And I&#39;ll rise like the break of dawn<br>Let it go, let it go<br>That perfect girl is gone<br>Here I stand in the light of day<br>Let the storm rage on<br>The cold never bothered me anyway
Fun fact: is that I only found out about the singer in 2024

Fun fact: had no idea Demi samg this song
Dang, this song gave me nostalgia vibes. Watched this after watching Frozen😭
Well beyond 10 years since this released back in 2013, gotta thank the cast (namely Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell) and crew behind Frozen for help making this movie possible. But most importantly, Demi Lovato for giving a rousing performance for the pop version of the Oscar-winning hit song Let It Go! I take my hat off to you.
bought my first car 10 years ago, this was the first song I played in it. Needed some money and sold the car last year. Every time I hear this song, brings me back all the good memories with my old car. I miss it so much 😢
Movie - Frozen

Who’s listening this in 2024🎉
2024 still here for her amazing vocals ❤
Hello 2024 🎉
Such a great song and Demi&#39;s voice is so good. I just don&#39;t like it when artists change the melody of how the original sounds. People say that it&#39;s nice for artists to inject their own style and personality, but why does that have to include melody tweaking? So while I think Demi does a good job in here, I don&#39;t like the parts where she changes the melody (personal preference). Same as how I did not like Halle Bailey&#39;s version of Part of Your World. While she has a beautiful voice, she absolutely ruined the song for me because of the changes she made to it. A great example of how an artist can still own a cover song completely without messing with the melody is Pink&#39;s cover of Hopelessly Devoted by Olivia Newton John. 😍 She didn&#39;t mess with the melody, she sang it as it is, but still made it her own.
Who else is watching 2024? .,.
Who can listened in 2024

Hello
Stop comparing this version with Idina&#39;s to say this is bad, this is a pop version its not supposed to be the same as the original, Im pretty sure Demi could sing the original version and it would sound amazing too.<br>I know Idina&#39;s version is epic and literally gives me chills, this is not supposed to be that
Your listening to this song in 2024 you gotta like lol😂
It&#39;s 10 years ago since  the first movie got released... It feels like I watched the   movie  in the cinema  since yesterday.... Bro I gotta cry

I can say that she actually cant sing this way on live. Her live performance is different from this video.
Ya
Funs:listening to this music in 2024
There&#39;s someone listing in 2023?
Why I like this one better: “up here in the cold thin air, I finally can breathe. I know a left a life behind, but I’m too relieved to grieve!” I think this line tells Elsa’s story so much more than the whole song of let it go and it’s so relatable. She’s just so happy to finally be free she doesn’t see the consequences of her actions yet.
I am
Elsa: This is me!
Unpopular opinion: this is better than Idina Menzel <br><br>It also would have been cool if they made the live action room turn icy/cold as the song built

Happy 10th Anniversary to Frozen! I was only 5 when it came out. My cousin and I watched the movie at the theater with my parents. We later brought her home after she slept through the movie (LOL). I later went to my grandparent&#39;s old house and celebrated Thanksgiving with her and my dad&#39;s side of the family. I miss those days. Please, I beg of you enjoy your childhoods. November 27, 2013-November 27, 2023.
Let it go, let it go<br>Can&#39;t hold it back anymore<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Turn my back, and slam the door<br>The snow blows white on the mountain tonight<br>Not a footprint to be seen<br>A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I&#39;m the queen<br>The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside<br>Couldn&#39;t keep it in<br>Heaven knows I tried<br>Don&#39;t let them in, don&#39;t let them see<br>Be the good girl, you always have to be<br>Conceal, don&#39;t feel, don&#39;t let them know<br>Well, now they know<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Can&#39;t hold it back anymore<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Turn my back and slam the door<br>And here I stand<br>And here I&#39;ll stay<br>Let it go, let it go<br>The cold never bothered me anyway<br>It&#39;s funny how some distance makes everything seem small<br>And the fears that once controlled me, can&#39;t get to me at all<br>Up here in the cold, thin air I finally can breathe<br>I know I left a life behind, but I&#39;m too relieved to grieve<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Can&#39;t hold it back anymore<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Turn my back, and slam the door<br>And here I stand<br>And here I&#39;ll stay<br>Let it go, let it go<br>The cold never bothered me anyway<br>Standing frozen in the life I&#39;ve chosen<br>You won&#39;t find me, the past is so behind me<br>Buried in the snow<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Can&#39;t hold it back anymore<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Turn my back and slam the door<br>And here I stand<br>And here I&#39;ll stay<br>Let it go, let it go<br>The cold never bothered me anyway<br>Let it go, go, nah-nah<br>Here I stand<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Let it go
The most heartwrecking version of this song. Reminds me of my escape from abusive home. Chills every time I listen to this. Truly grateful that this piece of art exists.  &lt;3
10 years old!<br>I still love Demi and this version of the song so much
صدقيني الفكره الي براسك افضل
My sister loves this song so much
ERES LA MEJOR,Y FANTÁSTICA ⭐⭐🏆⭐🏆⭐🏆⭐🏆🏆⭐⭐⭐
Happy 10th anniversary Frozen (og release date: 11/27/2013)! ❄️⛄️👸🏼
Happy 10th Anniversary Disney&#39;s Frozen!! Just Let It Go!🌨🌨❄❄❄❄❄❄💙💙
Não curto Frozen mais a voz é linda demais amo a cantora 💯
It&#39;s almost 10 years, I listened to this song when I was 11 years old, and now I&#39;m 20, when this music video pops out on my homepage, I rewatch this. So nostalgic 😢❤
Happy 10th anniversary Frozen. 💙❄⛄👸🏼
Her voice ❤❤
10 year ago!! A whole decade! Whose still here for the memories ♥️⭐️❄️🥶
Why I like this one better: “up here in the cold thin air, I finally can breathe. I know a left a life behind, but I’m too relieved to grieve!” I think this line tells Elsa’s story so much more than the whole song of let it go and it’s so relatable. She’s just so happy to finally be free she doesn’t see the consequences of her actions yet.
10 years from this and still better than the original&lt;3
¿Alguien habla en español o en portugués?
this shit was my jam
We will listen this until 2035😅

amazing&lt;3
She saying it’s just a half step down, hitting an high D, instead of Idina Menzel’s E flat… Might as well just go up one more half step? I wonder why she didn’t.
I like song❤❤❤😢

Oh my god I remember listening to this song when I was like 5! I didn&#39;t even know it was from Demi Lovato! This brings so much memories ✨

Tô viciada nessa voz linda 😮
omg!??! one of my fav singer!
Eu vi a Demi Lovato no jornal nacional no The town e ela cantou
This song reminds me of Supergirl from the DCEU
This song will always bring back memories of November 2013-January 2014. I remember when Frozen first came out I was only 5yrs old. I saw the movie in theaters, then when it came out on DVD in January 2014, my cousins first watched the movie then, we immediately fell in love with the Frozen franchise. 2013 was a great year for music especially, November, May, June, July, September, December, January, and March. I miss you 2013, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 was my childhood. This 2020&#39;s decade sucks.
We are making it out of Arandele with this🔥🗣
❤❤❤❤💙💙
I sang this version at my communion and that’s when I was 8 and I’m 17 now
❤❤❤❤❤ I love this song ❤❤❤
When you listen to this song in 2023 it hits different ❤
I suggest you all to go listen the french version of Anais Delva 😁
La amo, tiene una voz bellesima, aparte que ella también es una belleza
I&#39;m listening to this at night 😂
Oi
i dalje 2023
<b>It&#39;s been 9 years but this song will forever remain in my heart</b>

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br>Not a footprint to be seen<br>A kingdom of isolation<br>And it looks like I&#39;m the queen<br>The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br>Couldn&#39;t keep it in, heaven knows I tried<br>Don&#39;t let them in<br>Don&#39;t let them see<br>Be the good girl you always have to be<br>Conceal, don&#39;t feel<br>Don&#39;t let them know<br>Well, now they know<br>Let it go!<br>Let it go!<br>Can&#39;t hold it back anymore<br>Let it go!<br>Let it go!<br>Turn away and slam the door<br>I don&#39;t care<br>What they&#39;re going to say<br>Let the storm rage on<br>The cold never bothered me anyway<br>It&#39;s funny how some distance<br>Makes everything seem small<br>And the fears that once controlled me<br>Can&#39;t get to me at all<br>It&#39;s time to see what I can do<br>To test the limits and break through<br>No right, no wrong, no rules for me<br>I&#39;m free<br>Let it go!<br>Let it go!<br>I am one with the wind and sky<br>Let it go!<br>Let it go!<br>You&#39;ll never see me cry<br>Here I stand and here I&#39;ll stay<br>Let the storm rage on<br>My power flurries through the air into the ground<br>My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br>And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br>I&#39;m never going back, The past is in the past<br>Let it go!<br>Let it go!<br>And I&#39;ll rise like the break of dawn<br>Let it go!<br>Let it go!<br>That perfect girl is gone<br>Here I stand in the light of day<br>Let the storm rage on!<br>The cold never bothered me anyway
CONCEAL, DONT FEEL
Frozen Was the last good Movie Of Disney
I loved this song and I so
I was so obsessed with frozen when it came out😘
Idk why tf I’m here.
This song is a great litmus test. On the surface it&#39;s a celebration of independence and self-actualization. The people who stop their analysis there probably get swept away by the instrumentals and catchy lines without bothering to think about it.<br><br>Remember this song came from the snow witch at her worst, running away from everything she had in life, everyone she knew or cared for, to retreat to a mountain alone. &quot;Here I stand and here I&#39;ll stay.&quot; It was a rash decision but she&#39;s doubling down on it. &quot;The cold never bothered me anyway.&quot; She&#39;s caused endless winter, destruction, probably deaths, and she&#39;s only concerned with her own comfort. &quot;The fears that once controlled me can&#39;t get to me at all.&quot; Not fears conquered, not even fears confronted. Fears that she ran away from. You can&#39;t run away from fear, it&#39;s inside you. What happens when someone she cared about showed up and became the voice and face of those fears?<br><br>No, this song is not inspiring. It&#39;s a song of a little lost girl in desperate need of help even as she runs away from it.
Why i feel the lyrics right now?
I was in 4th grade when this song came out and now I&#39;m currently enrolled in 2nd year college. Time flies so fast after the year 2020.
Both versions are incredibly relatable, but one to someone in a position of trauma and wants to be set free and the other to someone who wants to bury their old self and rebuild like a phoenix.<br><br>Small changes in the lyrics that changed the meaning of the song.
me encantas Demmy Lovato te amooo
I one day I decided to watch frozen

I always wonder how Disney got her involved in another project like this after what happened to her while she was a Disney star
while i love this, the original is and will always be the best. even almost 10 years later, i still love it.
i was 12 frist time i watch the movie now am 21 🥺

Can you do ❤️💜🤍💙. if not, it’s okay
Let It Go, Demi<br>my favourite version of this song
wow ☝️ amazing 👌 adorable singing 😍✌️
9 years ago I was a child
❤
let it go, the covid never bothered me anyway. 2023.
This song never gets old! It shows what a lot of girls have to go through in life. They are usually told to be good girls and not show how they really are and what they really want. A lot of women have lived and are living according to society preferences just to be loved! This song sends love, happiness and strength to each and every woman in the world!💫
I loved this song so much as a kid (this version )
Not me actually listening to this in 2023 lmao
Te adoro demi lovato idola ❤❤❤❤❤
This video brings back so many memories I remember watching it on the end credits of my frozen CD 😭
I enjoy the song and by demi lovato 😘😘

My gosh, my music taste has evolved in the last decade. But this song still is banger!
Almost a decade , but still hits the same!...<br>I was a high school student then and now a graduate. Things changed, but this song still gives boost and that strong spirit!.❤
LET IT GO
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br>Not a footprint to be seen<br>A kingdom of isolation<br>And it looks like I&#39;m the queen<br>The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br>Couldn&#39;t keep it in, heaven knows I tried<br>Don&#39;t let them in, don&#39;t let them see<br>Be the good girl you always have to be<br>Conceal, don&#39;t feel, don&#39;t let them know<br>Well, now they know<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Can&#39;t hold it back anymore<br>Let it go, let it go<br>Turn away and slam the door<br>I don&#39;t care what they&#39;re going to say<br>Let the storm rage on<br>The cold never bothered me anyway<br>It&#39;s funny how some distance makes everything seem small<br>And the fears that once controlled me can&#39;t get to me at all<br>It&#39;s time to see what I can do<br>To test the limits and break through<br>No right, no wrong, no rules for me<br>I&#39;m free<br>Let it go, let it go<br>I am one with the wind and sky<br>Let it go, let it go<br>You&#39;ll never see me cry<br>Here I stand and here I stay<br>Let the storm rage on<br>My power flurries through the air into the ground<br>My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br>And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br>I&#39;m never going back, the past is in the past<br>Let it go, let it go<br>And I&#39;ll rise like the break of dawn<br>Let it go, let it go<br>That perfect girl is gone<br>Here I stand in the light of day<br>Let the storm rage on<br>The cold never bothered me anyway

No tengo a quien dedicar este tema tan fregon, pero te lo dedico a ti que leíste mi comentario Dios te bendiga te mando muchas bendiciones!!
Can&#39;t believe this is 10 years ago 😐😐
honestly, i feel like Demi Lovoto had a hard time because she grew up trying to be britney spears when she was an Adele.
Fue un éxito cuando salió y  es bueno ser libre pero no hay que abusar de la Libertad 💚 saludos desde Chile

Quando eu era criança, eu cantava essa música no coral da escola onde eu estudava durante a formatura e foi incrível, isso é muito memorável!!! Eu já assisti Frozen na minha infância e eu gostava muito da Elsa, ela é uma das minhas Disney Princesas favoritas! Desejo que essas memórias acontecessem de novo

Exactly why does this version exist? It doesn&#39;t add anything or improve anything over the original. If anything at all, it just adds a pretty face to the video, it is inferior to the orignal in each and every way. WHY THE FUCK DOES THIS EXIST?
Ur listening in 2024
After Idina Menzel, it was Demi Lovato who sang Let it Go in the 2013 Disney 3D-animated movie Frozen, 2019 Square Enix video game Kingdom Hearts 3, and Elsa was told as saying, the cold never bothered me anyway.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23demilovato">#DemiLovato</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23idinamenzel">#IdinaMenzel</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23elsa">#Elsa</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sora">#Sora</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23donaldduck">#DonaldDuck</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23goofy">#Goofy</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23letitgo">#LetitGo</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23frozen">#Frozen</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kingdomhearts3">#KingdomHearts3</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kh3">#KH3</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23disney">#Disney</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23squareenix">#SquareEnix</a>
