Odishi 😍
All is great but wait, PAPYRUS??????????
Apni Beti ko hee sath launch kar letii
Kya ye movie old Kajol movie dushman ka 2nd part hy m she looks gorgeous 😍😍😍😍
A love Kajol&#39;s previous movies. She is a great actress, but sadly I could not complete watching this movie, as the was to much swearing in this movie.
👍👍👍👍👍
First time I see Kajol swear like this. 😂
I started the moving because of Kajol and 15 minutes into the movie I cannot see her anymore. Extremely irritating acting by her. Sorry but she looked the worst in the most beautiful dress in classical dance.
acting should be done silently, if possible.
Just watched this movie. It&#39;s amazing. Full of emotions. It shows you how your choices have an impact on your family. Must-Watch, guys!
Cute Acting Kajol.<br>by<br>Tamil pasanga Fans
She’s definitely a tremendous actor, but I wouldn’t recommend watching this film with your growing kids! Too much unnecessary swearing🙄
BC&#39;s tum to film Bane ke chale jaati ho...Bus ye to acting h hmm?..or rhe gye jaate bichare young audience..jo inspire ho jaati hai..or apni zindagi Hell kar lete hai?? Ek no. Ki Hinduphobia movie hai!
🙂
This movie is like one of those 90s movies if you’re a feminist you can’t be a good wife and a responsible mother
I insist all women to watch this movie, Men might not find it interesting though, but it is a very thoughtful film. 5 stars from me.
Outstanding
Really good movie
Kajol jesi hit actress Gandi galli bolti he <br>Wo bhi Uske pati Ajay Devgan ki film me <br>Shame on both of them 🤛🤛
Hi
I loved the movie and kajol acting my God 👌🎦🙌Damm mmm natural one thing only when she cuss in English 🤣🤣🤣I couldn&#39;t stop laughing
وربي الفيلم يجنن شوفوا 😭😭😭❤️
Kajol is love
Kajol is a Bengal Tigress ...All other actors are good too but Kajol ...her lineage shows in her acting 😊
KAJOL the BEST
Love you kajol
KAJOL SABSE JYADA OVERACTING KARTI HAI
Kajol is just Amazing !
Love you kajol
One of the best movies.....on Netflix....but were they got this crazy name ...like the title of the movie...
Sary Best comentYtar idhr hi aa gay Hain Kya😘💋
Successful woman who chase their dreams are already so much judged.
While, we are learning how to accept women&#39;s broken relationships. This movie portrays the popular belief that it&#39;s not safe for woman to marry ( or get into relationship) again. Imagine our middle class parents of 10+ kids watching this.
Here for mithila 🥰
This was an amazing movie...... Liked kajols role
kajol morocco ♥

I start enjoy this story at quarter time and was crying half until ending..<br>No sad crying but happiness with i imagine my family...<br>Not all broken family was broke...just how we pass it with patient and keep smile altough sadness inside...<br>Love u mom kadz from Indonesia
Bekar hai maat dekho ....
What a film! Inspiring and a delight to watch… Tanvi Azmi, Kajol and Mithila… Kunal is simply adorable! <br>Magic on screen, bought together by Renuka Shahane ❤️
I love kajol
I am proud that someone atleast cared for Odisha&#39;s culture!
Kajol çok tatlı 😘😘
One of the rare movie saw after such a long time. Phenomenal acting..
Woow 😍😍Kajol she is Just perfect ❤❤😘😘
Three most perfect actress ....waiting for film.,,love you guys
Wow..what a movie I have seen its really beautiful more likes
Watched 13 minutes of the movie and I can&#39;t stop myself to comment on this. Same idiotic and over-the-top acting by Kajol. Loudmouth and swearing for no fuckin reason at all. So annoying and ridiculous to watch her acting. Maybe this movie will be the last nail in the coffin of her career.
Good movie but hard to watch in some places due to how real it felt.
i wish bangla dub was available on netflix :)) my mom doesn’t know hindi at all. i really want her to watch this movie.
Kajol always make me smile

Tawiwjetjsksgeksfwkwehmdhdldlfudmdbdkd
They only thing Kajol did was use fowl useless language unnecessarily. “Profanity is the effort of a feeble brain to express itself forcibly.”
U knw there r stories which cant explain into words, it&#39;s all about living that beautiful story  at the moment ❤ <br><br>Amazing work team tribhanga.
Must watch movie.. I thoroughly enjoyed, loved and cried too.. <br><br>Thanks everyone who worked on front and behind the scenes. Your efforts got success. Many more such successes to all. 😍
😍😍
Hats off to Renuka Shahane ji 👏👏👏 Loved the film...the art in it...the story line....an eye opener for all who have gone through similar situations....an emotional turmoil presented sooo well....even Kajal ji s costumes.....Wishing you all success in producing more of such lovely pearls of cinema...🥰
My opinion Kajol should stop acting. All she knows is overacting. Give me any movie which she really acted??  My My really hate to watch her movies. Such a waste if my time to watch her movies. Terrible actor I mean Overly over acting
bhai..  am I the only one who thinks that this movie is little bit like shakuntala devi..
I see there was supposed to be a concept but this was terrible. Every scene she&#39;s swearing. Not one scene of her doing the dance. Whoever created this movie 👎👎
Ye full movie KB aye ga place raply
Kajol G Me Ap Ko Buhat Pasand Karta Hoon Wallah
Finally midhila is getting her deserving chances.She is such a beautiful charming talented girl underutilized by Bollywood.
Nice film
I was in tears watching this becos it just reminded me about holding onto small grudges in life, and just letting go of them before its too late..🥲🥲🥲🥲
Truly a great story I have watched it just now.Those who are wondering If this is good or not it is the best , You should really watch it.
will watch for Mithila
A unique and womanistic concept. As a woman, absolutely loved it!<br>Kudos to Kajol and Renuka(writer).
Anyone can tell me what does it mean Trivanga?
This masterpiece deserves awards.<br>This movie made me realize something I never thought of. Thank you so much for making this movie.<br>Congratulations to the entire team. Your efforts paid off.
Excellent moviel!! One of the best!!
Kajol ты супер. I love you.
Kajol ты супер. I love you.
The plot is more or less similar to Shakuntala Devi
Setiap kali melihat film india jadi teringat sahabat terbaikku yang ada di sana Hashik semoga sehat selalu....<br>Semoga suatu saat bisa bertemu aku sangat merindukanmu...
absolutely loved the trailer 👍
I can&#39;t stop myself from crying in climax 😭 this movie is masterpiece ❤️ acting level of Kajol as well others actor and actress are mind-blowing...<br>My favourite character is that story writer 😁😁😁 &quot; jhattttu&quot; ❤️
It’s directed by Renuka Shahane, I can’t see her name mentioned anywhere
good
Kajol mam was wearing our traditional dress odisha ka odissi costume. So 🙂❤️😘😘
😍😍😍🇧🇩
Uppena movie date
Good to see Mithila in this
Very nice movie.  I watched it.  Worth watching.
Garbage 🤮🤮🤮🤮
I wonder if non marathi people will understand dialogues in this movies or not. Because there are so many Marathi dialogues in this film .
I use to love kajal but t in this move I just hit her to English she think she is not an indian o my god I just hit her
One of the best films I&#39;ve seen in a while. Loved it! Kajol is an incredible actress, I&#39;ve enjoyed all of her films.
Wonderful movie
The white tiger too same swearing n dirty scenes n Language
Too much swearing how can you watch with family kajol doing this kinda movies
This is a very beautiful sensitive movie. I loved it, so did my Mum. Thank you Renuka Shahane 😘
Kajol should do more movies. Fans are waiting !
Only love for mithila😍😍
Korean drama dub in hindi
The movie is good but it gives out a BULLSHIT morale that if you don&#39;t have a man in your life, in the end, nothing is right. The story shows that you need a man in life to stabilize your life and the life of other women in your life. Even though you think you do everything right in your life, you have after all shitted yourself by not having a man in your life to stabilize it. But it is society that does this. Life is actually stable but society ruins it for you. This actually should have been emphasized more in my opinion
Proud to be a Oddissi Dancer❤️❤️
Kajol !!! damn it ! You squeeze my heart,  the topic is really very interesting and important ❤️
0 percent in the entire world have covid  yet all governments want the ENTIRE world vaccinated despite the dangers of this vaccine
Omg she&#39;s looking so  good!
Meera seaghel yay
Anyone seen the movie?<br>How&#39;s it?
I love Kajol acting.  She is real good.  Lovely and Gorgeous.
total cringe. reminds me of her annoying voice from k3g
Copy of Shakuntala devi?? 😶🤔🤔
after first half of the movie i realised the movie isnt for me
Super movie...good messege movie. Super actors and art. Dilogues to superse bhi upar. Super script and direction...thank you Tribhanga and team for excellent art👏👏👏👍
she even can&#39;t open her lips .. she took all her chin away
I think Kajal behave over reactive overconfidence drama 👎
Can somebody suggest me what do I do my husband family is torturing me<br><br>For past one year I have been suffering. <br><br>In there sense<br><br>Men is okay I<br><br>Agar Wo gali deta<br>Paise mangta lady se<br>Uska gla pakdta <br><br>So many things <br><br>Pls help me
Kajol looks like 30 year old😘😘
kajol swearing was the hottest thing ever
Suscribe my channel guys
If you care for children, you will not support Netflix and Hollywood!!! Children are trafficked by the elites from government, hollywood, large corporations, Wall Street and very top officials.  Do your research!!!  There are plenty of evidences in public. If u search... u will  find the truth.
She is prettier day by day and still ruling the world with her acting skills
BEKAR HAI MOVIE
Let&#39;s see how many people subscribe me on this comment.
Why is no one taking about mithila. Hey career graph is going up exponentially
oooh this looks good
I don&#39;t know what has happened to indian films. Itni filthy language.. uff kaano se dhuwan nikalne laga. It was unbearable. Kajol is my all time fave but I could just not bear all that swearing coming out of her mouth. The other recent movie was Ludo. So much gandi language. Chalo..aik do words use karliay to chalta hai. Har thori dair baad kuch na kuch.. please dear film makers and dear Netflix.  Swearing and filthy language doesn&#39;t make your content good or a movie super hit. So disappointed.
I am done with Bollywood
Too much bad language coming out of Kajol mouth in movie!  Movie concept is good, but cursing is way too much, cheap! This is bollywood movie not hollywood..
She is D grading  journalist
Abusive language
Gvvxf
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVNmHMWv2mc&amp;t=42">0:42</a> the Most Promising apt for Kajol&#39;s Attitude... Wish this Movie Could reach many... All The Best Mam❤️💐
She is a good actress but not a dancer.
Really after a long time  mesmerizing bollywood movie , what a  beautiful story..❤️❤️
.Waiting for a kindly hearted person who can support me with his true heart and understand my problem .❤️🥺...
WHEN IS THIS RELEASING OMGG
And yes, the directors and producers also show you how to disrespect your elders or better still.....throw them out of your homes. What better a movie can you get ? As they will most certainly say.....&quot;Fuc.....you&quot; !!
It is strange. Script; full of filthy language. Acting; nothing to write home about. Story line; not worth even mentioning. Acting and story line can be understood, as both are talent based, which every individual has in varying degrees. But screen language ? At least that can be a bit mediocre.....the abusive content is atrocious, the &quot;Fuc...&quot; is used so, so frequently, that one gets sick of hearing it. Renukaji, such  low level of script is not expected. Or are you too perverted in the language department ? The movie shows the mother involved with two different men. That&#39;s fine....it happens. But the daughter ? She&#39;s proud to show off different men who come into her life ! Is that what we portray to the audience ? That yes, go ahead, have as many partners as you want. This movie is certainly not worth watching with your family.....unless you want to bring up an abusive and perverted family.
I really think curly hair is mithila&#39;s signature look ... but on this movie , that straight hair is giving mithila a kind of  sanskari , grounded housewife vibe which is adding up to her character...
Its very emotional .. very rich meanings <br>I like it so much ..😭😭.
KAJOL IS DISASTROUS HERE. PLEASE GIVE CHANCES TO NEW COMER<br>PPL ARE INTERESTED TO SEE NEW FACES OR AT LEAST ACTING BRILLIANCE<br>COME BACK AND TOO FOR PRIVILEGED AND FEW SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED
can someone tell me how the movie is?
Amazing movie.... It can beat Hollywood
Great to see Marathi in Hindi films.
Kajol ugly
Really good movie and extremely great acting by Kajol. Seemed like she is back into action as in early youth. Nice and beautiful story. All cast did a great job. All I wanted to point is the language. It&#39;s okay to portrait Kajol as a rough and tough character as per the experiences in her childhood days, I totally agree but could have avoided the word &quot;F**K&quot; many places. The amount of word F*ck used in this move was so much. Makes it hard to watch with small kids. It almost passed a message that the word &quot;F*ck&quot; is normal to use. What if the people started using it in even normal conversations. Already the world is changing. So that&#39;s the only thing you guys needed to be careful. Should have avoided that to that many times. It sounded so awkward. Anyway good overall job.👍🏼

Kis kis ne ye movie dekhi kaisi hai please reply de dena koi
Mens are like tissues... I want this dialogue to be used by a Male to women then so called liberals will attack men left right and center.
Mithila where are ur curls 🙄
If people stop respecting relationship, it will bring nothing but distress and agony to the humankind.<br><br>Humans will lose the depth in living. And it everything will be insensitive and cruel.
Don&#39;t promote such stories and lifestyle. It harms the kids in the end. People who are still attached and living according to the traditional way our ancestors have taught us are way better than these so called modern families. <br><br>And traditional people don&#39;t disrespect women and girls.
Hum tum and them also described women of 3 different generation and labelling mother&#39;s standard either as superior or low without understanding women as a normal human being.
I want to see kajol as a dark evil villain ..  <br>like GUPT movie ..
The film addresses issues that society wants to obliterate and not address. Wow, you are really a wonderful Kajol  waw waw waw waw
Netflix India is getting better. Can&#39;t wait to see Kajol and Tanvi Azmi together. My mother is very fond of Tanvi Azmi, even she kept my name as hers due respect :)
Kajol ❤️👉 the great actress
Why is it that in all ajay devgan home productions with KAJOL, she acts like it is completely normal for a woman to be insane? She is always acting like she is a badly brought up woman with no manners and no shame for herself? Can&#39;t she ever act like a real normal woman? I cannot relate to her ever. Is it the niceness in me or is it that everyone apart from me is so crazy that misbehaving, screaming, and abusing is the new normal??!
loudulalith ka trailer
Kajol ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎
Sorry Kajol ji, gali k bina v app acting kar sakti thi.......
HowZz that Dd National!!! 008 reporting for Duty Maam!!! Winkk
Loved the movie!!!!
Kajol <br>❤❤❤
Excellent costume designs esp kajol
Saw the movie, its nothing exceptional, not much plot oriented. But Kajol&#39;s character was different than usual roles she plays and she plays beautifully, Overall is 6/10
Please stay away from this toxicity. Especially Kids...
We beautifully scripted ,directed. <br>KAJOL awesome performance. Enacted so well . Kept the audience tied till the end. Must watch
Rubbish
Very nice story
Bakwas series
Bollywood me women empowerment like apne pati ko chhodo 10 loundo se mrvao or mrvane k baad apna dream purra krro😂😂 feminist saale
Shitiest movie I ever seen😂😂😂
What a disgusting movie, horrable propaganda. Were not white or black were indians we have values, im all for equal rights but this is disgusting.
KAJOL
expired &amp; not relevant.
Puri kahani bata de trailer dekha k flim dekh k kia kare aab
Aur ek propaganda 🥱🥱🥱
Where is your indian culture? Movie is promoting vulgurity by women. Totally hate kajol after doing this. Cussing could have been avoided. Super annoying movie
Kajol is overdramatic just like her 90s while the rest well performed sensing normal
Jhatu movie
Started uploading videos , first gaming video is on Minecraft longest Parkour challenge.<br>So pls visit my channel and like , comment and share
I loved it.....
Great movie .......
Netflix aapko kuchh or content nhi milta kya 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Landuri kajol
Kajol killed that character LMAO &quot;You don&#39;t fucking wipe your nose and keep the tissue&quot; I laughed so had when she described marriage!!! wonderful acting by all
Something new 👍👍
Worst movie ever...
So good to see finally Odisha culture is slowly coming up on the Bollywood platform not with sterotypical (bongs ,Sardar, gujus)
Mainly I am here for  Mithila.She is good actress.Kajol is the legend..
Pathetic movie
Loved the movie ❤️
Disgusting 👎
Another misandrist movie in the name of empowerment  made by a snowflake feminist... i don&#39;t know how  makers have a conscience
Glorifying abusive language, no respect for any relationship &amp; so on...What to expect from netflix...flop
I hope one day I can also explain you both beta.. only thing I did was love you ......
Most discussing film
Worst movie of the decade with mean message 😡😡😡thuuuu
these characters are total garbage and living in a lustful lala bollywood world...
Women empowerment = Smoking, daru, hukka, drugs, abuse, multiple sex no respect for elder 👍<br>Jo apne parivar ko support kre wo pichde hui soch wale. Gire hue log 👍<br>Bas. Or Netflix se ummed b nhi thi wese, k kuch alg hoga
Itni gandi aur ghtiya film maine meri life me ni dekhi.....budhaape me kajol pagal ho gayi h......<br><br>Kya dikhaana chahte h ye ....k khull.k sharaab pio....sex karo...ye azaadi hai....<br>Nakli aur ghtiya film
Please do not see this movie, an other propaganda to break the Indian undivided family system, selling point of India
More dangerous than four more shots,, please ignore it
😭What a Movie kajol is a great Actor wow salooot you kajol👌👌👌👌👌💯🌹😘
akand chootiyapa!
Wow bollywood, nice propaganda to tell people that run for your dreams and left your family behind, our culture and our language.... Or kitna niche giroge beta bta do ab.
Yeh log hare Krishna bol kar india ko loot rahe hain. Sab Krishna ki policy par chal rahe hain. Shri Ram ko toh yeh log galat bolte hain.
Yeh Gujrati badsoorat kyon hotte hain?
Bad bad movie !!
Bhot hi bkwas series. Conservative narrative keval show kr rhe hai vo bhi negatively. Kuch to sharm kr lo. Aur itni gali galauz dena jruri hai. Vo mother doughter k relationship k beech.
Below average movie ☺
Ajay Devgan and Renuka also deserve lot of appreciation for this movie. Laughed at Kajol&#39;s language and Loved watching it.
Kajal look 20 years younger than her age.  She is aging like a fine wine...
Who&#39;s here after this movie is in #1 trending?
Tanvi axmi and kanwaljit singh after 23 years. My family no.1 memories renewed❤
میں ایک غریب ہوں ساتھ پڑتا بھی ہو اور مستری کے پیچھے کام بھی کرتا ہوں میں نے چینل بنایا ہیں ہے  پلیز مدد کرے <br>یا اللہ جو یہ پڑ کر چینل سبسکراب کرے اللہ اسے نیک اولاد دے اور اس کی نیک خواہیش پوری کر آمین<br>I am a poor and also a little bit of work, I also have a craftsmanship, I have made the channel, or helps to make a channel subscribed to Allah, give them good humans.
The story is nice.But here&#39;s not shown anything of Anu&#39;s father part at the last.I think it&#39;s a bit of disappointing.Or maybe they wanted to show the reality IDK.
Jitni feel pankaj tripathi, manoj paayee ko gaali bolte sunne mein aati hai, utni kajol ke saath nhi aati 😂
nothing special about the movie trying to be more like white people using more abusive language doesn&#39;t make you better.
I like kajol and her acting , but I am disappointed . You are setting a wrong example. 👎👎Freedom also has some limit.
There is no need to put &#39; shivya&#39; in any characters&#39;. Dialogues .  Some decency should be maintained.
Please help me from Russia I can&#39;t afford to buy food. Please help MasterCard 5536 9138 6657 7311 Thank you for your help
Tanvi Azmi is always wow
Kajol is very rude to fans.
Watched it last night and loved it.  Great story and acting
Hope Netflix continues to make good films like this. At times only trash films are there .
Perfect film ,perfect cast, and the perfect write and director❤
Amazing movie....get to see good cinema and realistic movie .....totally loved it
Tanvi Azmi realized her mistakes in the end but Kajol ended up hating her that she didn&#39;t realize that her own daughter was called illegitimate by people. <br>Nice acting by all. <br>9/10 💟💓👑👻
وتواضعهها. كدام الكامره راءعه
Anyone else noticed how Netflix is bringing in all youtubers into bollywood?😂🙄😁
<b>Everyone is on fire</b> 💥
She has proved she is a one of the finest Actress in indian Cinema literally.
I remember Cushman Movie...❤️<br>Kajol and Tanvi Azmi<br>Anyone
Kajol. You were really great.
just watched the flim ...such a nice concept and completely different story and also relatable ..the way the movie depicted the life of  mothers just fabulous ...made me cry so hard
beautiful movie
Just finished watching Tribhanga........wonderful movie........truth touched my heart........everything was just perfect.......renuka mam did outstanding job.......and the actors were perfect tooooooooo
Does not suit Kajol abused language.
Story is all about rich people getting proper mental stability and meanings in relationships.<br>Of course they don&#39;t need to worry about money and confidence.
Hey guys please do Subscribe on my CHANNEL
Best dialogue of kajol- &quot;men are like tissues, who keeps them forever after using them?.&quot;<br>This movie is great for women empowerment and to show men their places.
Great movie!! Amazing characters!! Couldn’t stop my tears in the end!! Congratulations Renuka ji and the whole team!!
I loved this movie. The actresses were amazing. A movie that really is captivating. Highly recommend. 💜
Kajol best best actress
God knows why is it called tribhanga! God knows why director renuka sahane made kajol an orissi dancer! God knows when kajol will understand that jorse chillana is not acting it&#39;s called overacting
Make me cry 😢! Pls love your mum
kajol acting is good but why bad words
30 mins into the movie and put it off.....too much foul language, trying to portray the cool mom......always liked Kajol&#39;s acting but this was a let down.....like Mithila....watched her in Chopsticks and Little things....<br>This movie is 👎👎👎👎 bcos of Kajol&#39;s over acting n use of foul language.
wow Odissi...feeling happy to see Odissi is being used in bollywood movies...this dance form needed the deserving lime light......most of the danceforms are highly overrated...jay jagannath
Classic n perfect movie..good job Renuka Shahane 👍👍❤️
What a beautifull story. Great movie. Drama, humor, intriges, family.
Any tamil audience there 😎
Kajol is so pretty
Just watch the movie<br>Highly recommended <br>Don&#39;t judge the movie by trailer<br>Kajol was bang on 🔥🔥<br>Tanvi ajmi amazing <br>Mithila parker wonderful<br>Must watch
Watching Tanvi Azmi and Kalwanjit Singh work together after 21 years... I still loved the chemistry shown between them in Family No. 1 on sony tv in 1999
Kajol varsa ben tamamim abi reklam cevirse izlerim artık nabalim
Kajol mam&#39;s  natural acting is so good which dont  need any  words  a 👍 for whole film crew
Beautiful actors,loved it.Must watch
Gaaliya of Kajol is hilarious
Every woman must watch it <br>Kajol is awesome as always
Kajol sounds terribly loud.
Ye kaise kaise gande word use Kar rhi or kitne log isko apni idel mante Hai <br>Ek word kisan k liye nahi
Kajol yeah queen i will surely love this movie
Alguien???
Unpopular opinion - This trailer along with name of the movie is pure cringe
Superb
Best movie I have ever wanted since 2020
After very long time I watched a beautiful movie, Kajol is the best 😍
Watched this movie today and boi oh boi. No regret at all. Very well done and definitely out of comfort zone for Bollywood movies.
kajol i love you so much

&quot;My mother have no job&quot;<br>&quot;I want to do something&quot;<br>&quot;Please Subscribe and Support me subscriber &quot;<br>&quot;I am worse in world&quot;
Kajol you are the best. finally you did again something one can really look forward to see you again. You will do more films. I am sure. love from Switzerland xx
The moment I found out they switched this from Marathi to Hindi, I knew this was going to be a terrible film.
Wonderful make Tribhanga. Wonderful. Cried throughout the movie. Yes, wished the ending was different. That’s life🤷🏻‍♀️<br>Kajol’s performance - par excellence 😘<br>Especially in one of the scenes, in which the character of Kajol is seen ill-treating the mom, played by Tanvi. Tanvi being such a senior artist, I wonder how tough it must’ve been for Kajol. <br>It’s on Netflix 👍🏻😊
Kajol G. Bus aise he acting karto raho.. mast lagti ho.. Adbudh ho adbudh ap... ❤❤❤❤
The best movie with the best actress💪Kajol💓✌
Awesome storyy.. And acting was super se upar....we need only good content.. Not masala...
Had to shut the movie off coz couldn’t stand kajol’s overly loud and rude portrayal in the movie :/ Gave me a headache.
Excellent movie ❤️❤️
I just watched tgis movie...damn that is so good ...not gonna lie .it will surely make u cry.  ❤️Loved it..must watch

Horrible pathetic
Kajol is ❤️
Mithila palkar fans
Actually this movie was Tribhanga....tedhi, medhi and crazy . 2.5/5
overacting kajol
worst movie
Itne bure din aagye kajol k..inlog k sath Kaam krna padh rha h..kidr gye ajayji bachalo
Who came here for manav Sir and kajol
An amazing story <br>Of three women
This is beautifully sad
Wow. This is wow.
Super duper the best, relatable, “filmy Dunia se alag” kind of real story, touched my heart deeply especially the climax and how I felt we can’t blame depends on the situation we go through in life and not realize what and where have we gone wrong&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>After ages like literally, this movie had made me cry<br>Must watch, credit goes to all the artists not only Kajol but everyone the whole team which includes everyone
A complete must watch movie
Kajol is Legend. 🙏💜
Aajtak: aapka beta margya aapko kaisa lag raha hai....<br>But Kajol:aap ki maa koma ma hoti toh aapko kaisa lagta...
Biryani monster❤❤❤❤
This is amazing movie cried and laughed cried more it’s such a beautiful movie so refreshing and so real just like life! Loved Kajol all actors did amazing job.
Kajol and Tanvi ji at their best. ❤️
Just watched...completely outstanding...the only thing I felt was Mithila had very less screen time...very nice movie. Highly recommended. Don&#39;t judge by trailer( I mean if you didn&#39;t like trailer , then also you would enjoy watching ..
Khuda k liye channel subscribe krdo<br>Mn boht ghreeb hn 1 subscribe krny se kia jata hai hath jodh k khta hn plz subscribe krdn😭😭😭😭😭
E kajaj kavhi buddi nehi hughi kiya 😦
Saw the movie just now ... amazing script 👏 👌 🙌 😍.. it should go to Oscar&#39;s for sure
Ek dum tedhi, medhi aur crazy movie thi!! Loved it!!
I cry when i watch this movie omg i love kajol ❤️❤️❤️
Watched this movie. Beautiful ❤️ shows the cycle of parents and kids relationship.<br>And how we understand everything better as we age...<br> Must watch.
If SRK is the king .kajol is the Queen 😍✌
Just loved it!!!
I watched the film. It was amazingly awesome....❤
Trailer mein hi kahani samajh a gayi..movie dekhni ki kya jarurat??😂😂😂
Kajol always overrated just sucksssssssssssss
Interesting😜
Sometimes we only remember the beating from our parents but we forgot the lesson we learn from that beating .... We realize that when they&#39;l gone.... Just need to see from their point of view too...
Bakwas  trailer  hai😠😠😠
Wonderful amazing acting by kajol..you nailed it kajol..
Just watched the movie... very deep movie..the narrative was what made the movie... initially  Kajol comes across being so loud and uncaring ... but then as the story progress...at the point when she realized that she had become her mother ..( unable to protect your kid and how her daughter suffered her decisions ) is the most poignant  point of the movie...the movie could not have been pulled off without these brillianr actresses.. hats off to writer and director
Super movie and really appreciate kajol for choosing this..... simple yet superb touched my soul
kia ye kngana ki bio hh
The prettiest kajol ma&#39;am ❤️❤️❤️
Proud of mithila.she is making her way ✨❤️
Kajol 🤩
Wow Tanvi ma&#39;am and Kajol ma&#39;am together after sooooooo long....
AAI❤
Marathi director marathi actresses 1) kajol 2) mithila 3)tanvi azami And actor vaibhav tattavadi 🤩🤩🤩all marathi 😍
SRK is struggling and Kajol&#39;s current career is getting praise (which is good), <br>I feel sorry for SRK but his choices are 👎
Can&#39;t believe that he is the same boy who played Aargya in Bandish Bandits....
Mithila Palkar.....highly underrated
Totally Bahiskar Krien Sabhi Bhartiye Bollywood Ka. FILMS Ka Aur TV Added Materials Ka Bhi Bahiskar Krien Sabhi Bhartiye 🙏🙏🙏 Jai Shri Ram 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Why r people calling this movie Kajol&#39;s comeback ??
RENUKA SAHANE IS THE DIRECTOR !!!!!
Is it a trailer???matlab kuchvi😅😅😅
Feel like watching this trailer again and again .Powerpack performances .
The way Kajol walks in oddissi attire.. Not at all convincing of the character.
Ab OTT ka zamana hai
Waiting
Wowowooo
Mithila ka hair straight whattttttttttttttttt !!!!! Isliye sb bolte &quot;nothing is impossible&quot; 😂
❤️❤️
Brilliant by kajol❤❤
Ek aur flop movie taliyaan
Abhang, tribhang dance certain pose of odissi ❤️ from odisha
Kajol selecting different script
Mithila Love u
Three outstanding actress : kajal, mithila n tanvi  👋👋
Surely those who like it Let obscenity spread among the believers There is painful torment for them in this world and in the Hereafter (verse 24/19) Now those who show pornographic videos through movies, books, books, calendars, magazines, dramas, movies, pastors, Facebook, YouTube, various products, Google web sites, etc., are included in that verse (Tafsil Ibn Jal) Noor in the Mazari Tafsir of Quran Tafsir Nur)
I feel like the complete story is being told in the trailer they should have left something for the movie
Kajol ‘s overacting and 90s acting is way too redundant for 2021. She still feels acting is as frivolous as kuch kuch hota hai. Either Work on your craft or kindly leave 🙄🙄🙄
Kajol❤😍Milithi❤😍n kunal❤😍..nice trailer
Looks like Netflix&#39;s finest..
Kajol over acts
Netflix.. alwz with offbeat movies ❤️
I love the blue saari from the girl

Love Kajol - Loved her in the 90s. But these days I think she is not subtle on-screen except in Devi. After watching the trailer, it is safe to say her performance is similar to helicopter Ela. she is shrill. she was very good in the 90s films though. Let&#39;s hope the film delivers and I am wrong.
Brilliant 👍👍 I loved it. Different subject ❤️ definitely going to watch it
Kajol looking like sweet 16
Kajol ❤️
Nettflix India always sucks with content but this time, it seems they are doing a good job..
I couldn&#39;t be happier for mithila....all the very best
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Fab♥️♥️
Don&#39;t let people come up in movies.. and capture the ott also... Always think of you people.. never give chance to others.. keep on swallowing others opportunity..
The trailer is heart touching, the movie will be oscar winning in future ...👏👏👏
Kajol as usual overacting.. to watch only for two ppl Tanvi Azmi n Vaibhav Tatwavadi..
Tanvi Azmi very talented <br>She is so good in her character <br>All three very good
Mithila what happens to your hair style ?
वा... तिन्ही मराठी अभिनेत्री.. अप्रतिम... पर्वणीच आहे ❤️❤️
Mithilaaaaaaa😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘

Kajol.She is amazing
Happy birthday mithila
My always favourite actress Kajol mam
I’m a huge fan of Kajol! can’t wait for this movie!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates✌️
Is it just me or does anyone relates this with Gilmore  girls?
Koi free hai to trailer samjha dega ? It&#39;s not a joke I actually want to know . Super pumped up
Koi free hai to trailer samjha dega ? It&#39;s not a joke I actually want to know . Super pumped up

Just one word... Wow !!
THREE REASONS TO WATCH THIS FLIM :-<br>1)Kojol<br>2)Mithila<br>3)It&#39;s by netflix
Trivanga is a concept or a pose in odissi dance , this dance has many difficult poses that only trained dancers can do .
.........🎁When giving gifts💐........<br>🇺🇲 : thanks<br>🇮🇳 : ही ही ही ही इसकी क्या ज़रूरत थी 😂😂
Netflix always rocks😍😍😍👊
Wow 3 deviya ek saat..

Kajol acting all time best
Kajol dance odissi all right . Please kuchh asa mat karna hamara odissi dance kaa culture ke galat taraha pes naa karna . Love from Odisha ..
As always kajol is amazing. And first time mithila with straight hair (anyine noticed). Afer chopsticks im seeing mithila now. She is very natural.. all acted so well.. 3very good actresses
In Latin America waiting for this
I am slowly realizing how marvellous these actors are and how they are taking Indian cinema to a higher level.. Thanks to otts like Netflix
Kajol , you rocked girl
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,<br>1 Corinthians 15:3-4 <br><br>For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.<br>2 Peter 1:16 <br><br>And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.<br>1 John 5:20 <br><br>Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.<br>Hebrews 12:2 <br><br>If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God.<br>1 John 4:15 <br><br>In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus.<br>Philippians 2:5 <br><br>I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.<br>John 10:28-30 <br><br>Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.<br>Acts 4:12 <br><br>But he was pierced for our transgressions,<br>he was crushed for our iniquities;<br>the punishment that brought us peace was on him,<br>and by his wounds we are healed.<br>Isaiah 53:5 <br><br>This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.<br>1 John 4:9 <br><br>My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.<br>John 15:12 <br><br>If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.<br>Romans 10:9 <br><br>But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect.<br>1 Peter 3:15 <br><br>Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.<br>Colossians 3:15<br><br>..
Can Kajol show her anger without shouting and screaming?? She is certainly capable of doing it...
I think, maybe Madhuri would have better suited the role !
One word for kajol, outstanding 👍
She always the best I wish I was like her face her salty❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👌👌👌👌👌 I wish I could meet her someday
New and refreshing story. Looking forward to this one 👏🏼
Wanna watch this damn hard coz it has my lovely role model kajol n the fact tht Netflix always gives amazing content ...... Boom it 💣💥😍😍

Best wishes to you Kajal mam from Odisha 🎉🎉🙏
Kajol
Good zabardast
Amazing concept
Mithila ma&#39;am is Love
Odishi Gesture😍
I just love Kajol. Everybody has their  own favorite yaar
Looks similar to Shakuntala Devi film
Anu v/s Tanu
This is an art form
Why is nobody talking about odissi, atlast it&#39;s getting the attention and popularity it deserves. ❤️❤️
AY KAJOL KAJOL😍😍😘😘😘
Lots of luv to Kajol🙌🙌
Kajol always best💓💓💓💓💓💓
Awesome
Great ✌️👍
Kajol in odissi costume ❤️❤️❤️
Day by Day kajol looking younger and damn pretty 👍 she is outstanding performance
Kajol😍Few of those actress who knows acting and not just dancing unlike nowadays...
WOW!
I hated Helicopter Eela, but this one seems amazing! Looking forward to Tribhanga!!
Kajol is best ✨🎉🎉
Almost every Kajol film I&#39;ve seen have been amazing. Her acting is so amazing that the character she is portraying comes to life making you forget that she is the actor!
Good project
Kajol was is and will be mediocre 😑
I&#39;ve started watching Bollywood because of Kajol, she is so realistic in movies.a natural pure skill!
Y did u straightened your hair mithila I loved your curls always wished to have them i hope I get to see u in the same old look as before
I want to watch this. It reflects a part of my own life I feel. Eagerly waiting ❤️
I am so ready for this..
mithila palkar.............our monster biryani............
Mithila Palkar in the straight hair is the girl to die for ❤️
Great Cast from several generations. Tanvi has been commendable since “Ghalib”; Kajol of course is a force and Mithila stole the show from Irfan in “Karawan” and impresses just humming in a wheat floor commercial. Look forward to this movies.
Odia Pila like maro be
Tribhanga | Official Trailer...............woooooooooooooooooow
Kajol, in odissi get up🤩 wow.unexpected yet beautiful.<br>She is indeed one of the greatest actress in Bollywood.
Looks watchable, will watch it for Tanvi Azmi and Methila
👈👈👈👈इस तिरंगे के लिए 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮 कितने सब्सक्राइब मिलेंगे
hattttttttttttttt
Netflix blessings in disguise
Kajol = ageless talent ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
krk is not fit for such intense role
Kajol looked awesome in odissi costume.... Love from odisha
i just want to recommend HACK DON, i have used his service once and he really did a great job for me by retrieving the lost messages I needed for evidence, also by spying on my husbands phone communications like calls, text, emails, whatsapp and every other thing. someone referred me to him on here and it was helpful, an experience i would live to remember, so i&#39;m doing the same for anyone out there that needs such service. just message him, am quiet sure he will help you figure a way out. Email: hackdonstrong17 at gmail com Text: +19253185176 He&#39;s also on whatsapp +1 219 302 0318
Waste of resources!
Kajol hai toh badiya hogi
Am I the only one who missed Mithila&#39;s curly hair❤️
Well. I have always admired Kajol&#39;s works from my younger days. She has an aura that attracts people who like good movies. As we see actors like Saif Ali Khan doing great script movies and getting works regularly, we don&#39;t see actors like Kajol now and then. I hope to see her more with greater works and better days.
This Kajo... is most overrated actress 😡😡😡😡 She knows to only scream onscreen 😡😡😡 She can never do a vulnerable character like Sridevi or Tabu...!!!!  What happened to Helicopter Eela 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Tanvi ji is superb👌👌👌👌
उम्दा जीवन मतलब?
I was expecting more of mithila yarr
Just wow...Will definitely watch it😊
Kajol mam 💗💗
Nice acting all .... me bhohat khushu huu ki  odishi ko lekar story banaya  jay Jagannath. Thanks all members
Again A flop From Bullywood 🤣🤣🤣🖕
Well...... Directed.... Well performed
Bhangar chhe
Tanvi Azmi---flawless acing as always
First time Maine Kajol ko kisi Web serious me dekhna hai❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍👍
Bakwas movie
Mithilaaa
Just ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I think the cast kajol, mithila &amp; tanvi ji in single frame looking outstanding. <br>Full mark to casting director &amp; producers. <br><br>Tanvi ji is most fit in role of Kajol&#39;s mother &amp; mithila as Kajol&#39;s daughter looks brilliant match.
Kajol 😍😍😍
Oscar deserving actress kajol
❤️❤️❤️
Where is shweta mehendale in this?
Thanks to bollywood for exploring Odisha&#39;s culture ..

Bakwas
Kajol❤️

I still believe kajol was lucky to make it this long in Bollywood!
Only for KAJOL
Yes yes yes yes ......... Allah bless you Kajol
Why they ruined mithila&#39;s hairs?
कोई है इस त्रिंगा को लाइक करने वाला 🇳🇪🇹🇯🇳🇪🇳🇪
Music from Netflix...  Wow..

👌👌👍👍❤️❤️
Mithila is nothing but her hair. Feels like something is lost in her. Please don&#39;t make her hair straight
Best casting ever!! Gems of acting together!!
YOUTUBE ATRAK88 MY WAYS ........THANK YOU
Kajol nepo kid silent to the crimes of your industry sad mother of two but no mother you are shame on you
What a great combination of actors👍
Kajol starting her 2nd innings wid bang
Initially I thought it&#39;s a movie on Sudha Chandran, inspirational story about a classical dancer who lost her leg..!!
Really excited to watch Kajol and Tanvi Aazmi ...Wish it was tripti Dimri instead of Mithila ...She nearly made Karwaan unwatchable but for Irfan and Dulquer
Nice trailer 👍
Like Kajol
Kajol is the best actress in Indian film
Average content mila Kajol lo she deserves evem high than that !!
Its tribhangi not tribhanga the basic step of odissi!! You are basing a movie on a dancer and not even the basic research. Netflix India is supremely disappointing
Watch madagaja trailer
Copied from a Bengali movie..anyway that&#39;s Bollywood.. nothing is original here. Abhang sabhang tribhang sab bhanga..
Unlike her actresses of her age, Kajol is actually choosing off beat scripts and being in action.👍
Kajol
Hey @netflix web series law
Wow...no words...all talented actress and marvelous script
Netflix show mention film at list important credits of the film. Every time I see a great Trailer on netflix youtube channel, I gave to google it WRITER, DIRECTOR, and other important people related to the film. I Request you guy to please give this information with the trailer.
Kutti kahi ki wapas aagayi
Hey Netflix, if you like this comment, I will take 1 month subscription.
I think this is going to be a fully enjoyable performances...
Woman like deep sea u drowning drowning &amp; drowning....... But never reach his pain to understand
Kajol&#39;s screen presence is on another level.. She is a legend...
Kajol still with he acting capabilities can put all starkids out of jobs hands down hit like if you agree
Story seems to be a lil or more striking similar to Shakuntala Devi&#39;s mother-daughter duo relations....
Mithila Palkar ❤️❤️
Kuch toh original banalo, yeh bhi hollywood ka remake hain..
Alot of girls have dysfunction relation with their mother. It&#39;s going to hit those girls on a different level. <br>I am one of those girl.
but....... why papyrus? :/
Mithila looking so different in straight hair..I just love her curls😍
Kajol is a great actress..♥️♥️
Wahi wahi ...ghisa pita
Wow kajol
Kajol the queen
Kuch samjha nahi lattu Bhai
A starkid who can act
Kajol is Kajol that&#39;s it♥️
Kajol and tanvi ma&#39;am ❤
Imagin Mithila &quot;Patankar&quot;
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Chutiyapanti. Roona dhona aur Randi Rona. I&#39;d rather watch 1992 scam again.
Kajol ❤
Guys I can feel that this is crazy and really heart touching series we deserve.
Awesome trailer , nice actors and still it will be shitty story line.
I promise to try to remember who   <br>I am. Wife gets up on one elbow, 🤣🤣
Please cast kunal Roy kapoor more often Bollywood !!!
Absolutely flawless...we need more of this ❤️❤️❤️
Kajol still rulling the world even without doing any item songs &amp; wearing shorts...&amp; She&#39;s Looking more Young &amp; Prettiest day by day
Kajol&#39;s acting &amp; Tanvi ji&#39;s grace ❤️❤️❤️
Alfonso Cuarón directed Roma कि रीमेक ना निकले वास, बाकी सब ठीक है। 😂😂
Kajol - she is one wonder in this industry.. an actor who did not take her talent seriously. Eagerly waiting.
Mithila Palkar you rocks as usual😍👌
_Mam apki maa coma mai apko kaisa lagraha hai<br>Tumhari maa coma mai rehti tou tumhe kaisa lagta

Eyes locked by seeing kajol

Wow
At last kajol came back

Kajol is my all time favourite ..
Nice

Mithali
Yaar Baaki sab to thik hai but Over acting bahut jyada karti hai Kajol
Mithila looks super cute with  curlyy hairs...❤️😅
Now this is what is called is called acting.. powerful performance. Bollywood is incomplete without Kajol, Aish, Rani.. ❤️
I&#39;m Waiting
Best characters in one film 😍😍😍😍 I will definitely gonna watch all my favourite
I&#39;m always impressed by Kajol, her acting range is just outstanding.
Pakistani movie cake ki copy
Best seen
All things r fantastic but I want to know why nowadays heroine need to be shown having cigarette or drinking alcohol ?
Nice
Cannot wait ❤️
Can&#39;t  have enough of kajol ever...Mother of two and she is breathetakingly gorgeous...only kajol can say those lines....ab toh coma me chali gyi....ab ghumte raho bina taar ke wireless...
He is roll model
Kajol looks gorgeous... For her Age is just a number.
My favorite actress kajol
Kajol... Undoubtedly very Talented ❤️... Wish she would not have been from Dirty Bollywood 😌... Otherwise Thumbs up to the Whole Team of Tribhanga👍👍
Don&#39;t Know why but i almost started crying ,  specially when Kajol in Emotional Role ..... !   And dialogue looks really strong part of this Film.....
Mithila missing those curl hair , but still this is superb
I want kajol&#39;s dusky color back😢
I am sure this movie will be Rock.
My all time favorite kajol... Luv u...
Nice video..zara humare v channel ko dekhlo yaro
Kajol❤️🔥
Outstanding
Kajol was always good actors in the bollywood....nice trailer
No one can match the class of Kajol man,literally the queen of Bollywood
There is still so so much that the 90’s actresses can give to audiences. Sad that very few good, meaty scripts are written for them n those very few scripts and meaty roles are always given to a selected few. Kajol as usual is a delight to watch. OTT platforms can breathe new life n dimensions to these actresses and really bring out something new to them.
I&#39;ll watch this only because of Kunal Roy Kapoor
I don&#39;t understand trailer.
The grace is all captured within the Odissi outfit ❤
I think we are now going to have good content and acting.
No one better than Kajal in bollywood. Outstanding
one of the unhated star kid having amazing talent... kajol... wow
Natural acting makes it more special 🔥🔥<br>Best cast🔥
Amazing cast🎉🎉<br>All actor&#39;s acting are soo effortless 👍🔥
She is paying second time of kajol mom role in the movie after dushman
Mithila😍😍😍
Renuka❤
Kajol 💖💖💖😍😍🇳🇵🙏
so happy to see that finally odisi dance is recognized in bollywood platform. Its the greatest form cultural dance:)))
Mithila without her signature hair style ☹️
Mithali ❤️
Here After Salman Khan Tweet
kajol افضل ممثله هنديه  احبها ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🥺
&quot;My Dad is ill&quot;<br>&quot;And I have not job and money&quot;<br>&quot;YouTube not giving me views&quot;<br>&quot;I want to handle my family&quot;<br>&quot;Ya I m worse than others&quot;😢
awesome
Kajol... Kajol... Kajol
My boy Richard Lovatt getting beaten with the umbrella there!
I m so glad to see our odissi costume in first scene
Wow achi story hai emotional bhi hai thodi chat pati relax relationship ko batane wali lots of sacrifice omg 👍 good job kajol ji 👍 and all team ❤️
Happy to see the 90&#39;s actressess reinventing themselves outside the regimes of the 90&#39;s heroes.They managed to take away their share of fame back then but not now.Our women will thrive in their independence just like they have been in their patriarchy.
Interesting trailer....
Kajol🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
KAJOL   -    MIND  BLOWING
Kajol is forgetting how to act. Now she&#39;s just loud in the name of natural acting. With time, she is still stuck in her old ways of doing movies and the worst part is she doesn&#39;t even realise that.
Meethila palkar ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️JUST KILLED IT HER PERFORMANCE... मराठी मुलगी ❤️❤️❤️❤️😎👍
Nepo Product Kunaal Roy Kapur ko nahi lena thaa!
Any AKshay kumar fans here ❤️
Why every daughter who hates her mother  shares the same name &quot;Anu&quot;.<br>First Sanya Malhotra In Shakuntala Devi and now Kajol in Tribhanga.
I think that reporter haven&#39;t sence 😅😅  such a stupid question...
Can anyone suggest me good series of Netflix I want to start some new series ?
Kajol has such an irritating voice
Oooooo oooo❤️<br>Love from Odisha
Abhi bhi spark gaya nai hai...kajol mam
Our very own Kajol once again, best of luck ❤️😍
Will watch for Mithila ❣️
This is Zoe Kravitz&#39;s story in Big little lies! Atleast give credit Netflix 🙄
Tralier ne hi puri story bata diya <br>Ab film hi kya dekhe😑
Eagerly waiting for this movie. The trailer is so good.
𝙺𝚊𝚓𝚘𝚕 𝚗𝚒𝚌𝚎 𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚒𝚗𝚐
I can tell you by looking at the trailer that this is going to be a very bad film....
Super kajol mam
Good women characters
Netflix, it&#39;s high time to start giving credits to writers, director, editor, cinematographer etc.. Badly disappointed by what&#39;s going on..
&quot;Life is short thing &quot;<br>&quot;Girlfriend is nothing &quot;<br>&quot;Parents are motivation &quot;<br>Support is everything that I need😭🙏
If ever sex education made in india kajol will be ms Millburn
Sorry Kajol Bollywood is dead for me
Nice trailer
Kajol ❤️
It&#39;s going to be awesome .<br>So overwhelmed to see Kajol as an Odissi Dancer , seeing odissi is so rare .   Looking forward to it more now. Thank you to the director and Netflix
Kajol in Odishi costume<br>Looks elegant 🙏
Will watch it for sure ...👍👍👍
Kajol....<br>All the best...<br>Interesting.
Kajol’s overacting is intolerable.  She was struggling in some scenes too and had a lot of false moments.
Odishi dance
Kajol should get roles like 20s lady.... She is still looking like a teen.... She should try to do more younger roles like Divya Khosla Kumar.
Beautiful
Kajol looking so young &amp; pretty 😍
Nice.
Mithila in straight hairs....😍😍😍
Waiting for you kajol.....
Nice to see kajol again
I&#39;m waiting for your support!!
Only kajol
It might be a good movie. But the trailer was cut very poorly.
Omg I cannot wait
Renuka’s film looks good and intense,..
Der aaye prr kajol aaye <br>It&#39;s always a wonderful experience and excitement to see Kajol on screen she is the top actress who always makes her audience wow <br>I am always be a big fan her ❤️
Utter bullshit .
Kajol in Netflix!!??  My childhood crush here i come
Can&#39;t wait,  trailer ho toh aise, lots of mysterious scenes ❤❤❤
so 16th century yeh maa beti ka drama.
Where are mithali &#39;s curls ..they are her trademark ..almost unrecognisable 😐 <br>Ps I love her
what acting, what expressions, what energy... Kajol a living legend.
netflix should give chances to independent actors and not nepo-kids and karan jocker&#39;s drugs gang.
I love this Bollywood web series
With regret- Bad acting quite visible.. :-(
Tanvi Azmi after mithila Parkar?? Netflix seems to have no respect for seniority
आई अशी असते काय....eager to watch superb performance of kajol mithila
Very good story, many people can connect to it.
Why would anyone want to see kajol&#39;s loud acting  on  Screen again
Ek aur flop
Stop Indian news media channels and start some more platforms like Netflix..this will fill the people&#39;s hurt by love , affection and knowledge.
This trailer looks amazing, finally a movie with no bad scenes or abuses. Can&#39;t wait to watch
Wanna see more of Mithila.
I think there is some uncanny resemblance with the plot from Shakuntala Devi movie. The relationship which is shown between Shakuntala devi, her mother and her daughter.
Woww Kajol is back  ❤️ trailer looks great.. will definitely watch
Bhai jaan
Renuka Mam 🙏🌼♥️
Woow Sallu promoted
Was she abused
Always love kajol❤️
looks promising
Okk 2021is going to go good as I saw this trailer with some real acting and those efforts kajol mam 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 aap toh guru ho 🙏🏻❤️ we love u mam
Kajol best
Outstanding performance kajol mam...👌👍🙏🥰❤️
Kunaal roy kapur...
❤♥❤♥
Kajol in blue saree with &quot;Odissi&quot; costume... Just wow👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻Love from odisha ❣️
Story seems to be different and lady oriented. Waiting
Nashedi kangana should learn acting from kajol.. she need to do more work Cox people love to watch her on screen .. great performer and legend actresses..
Trivanga vs Tandaav. Which will win?
Kajol outshines all.. Kunal’s  acting is so bad ..doesn’t live up to the mark
Who else is scrolling down to read comments first 👍
Kuchh samjh ni aaya
I GUESS this movie is about sexual harassment.
Netflix Is The Best Platform &amp; Kajol is the best actress.
Mithila is the fantastic actress
&quot;Tumhari maa koma me hothi to aap ko kaisa lagta&quot;...😘😘 Best answer Kajol ma&#39;am ... Media ko esa jabab chahiye..
I will watch this film to see Vaibhav Tatwawaadi&#39;s acting.
Mithila Palker Little Things wali yaad aayi ❤️
Aisa Lagta hain Kabhi Kabhi ke  kajol aur ranbir Kapoor ke nass nass main khoon ki jagah ki acting Bhari hui Hain kya acting karte Hain yeh log . Jo role do ek dum perfect karte Hain.
Odisha people&#39;s report here 😇😇
Wow full of emotions.. Got goosebumps.. must care for ur family ..
Mithila Palkar looking very beautiful
Background music amazing
I love mithila
Wait a sec ! Kajol is playing Mithila Plakar&#39;s mother? And she has no issues with it !  What&#39;s wrong with our &quot;heros&quot; through? When will they finally be actors ?
Finally mithila got the chance to get a role in a movie with big superstars ❤️❤️
Same old family drama..nafrat,pyaar,sacrifices..
The combo pack of Odishi and Kajol🔥🔥🔥<br>My both two favourites are together ❤️❤️
Forget all the facts , why a cute girl like Mithila is shown in aunty Avatar🙄🙄🙄 <br>But then too my only reason to watch it is Mithila ❤️❤️❤️
Papyrus!
always wondered how mithila palkar would look like in straight hair
OP...❤️
Excited, Mithila ♥️ Kajol 💥 Tanvi 😊
Mithila 👌
This will stand up to the expectations ❤️
Omg mithila is lookin way gorgeous then her before curly hair looks
This is a masterpiece, mark my words
Dialogues were written in english and translated quite poorly into hindi..didn&#39;t expect such a lack of effort.
😂😂😂
Here for Kajol ❤️
All the best 👑🌹🙏
Bhai trailer me movie ka full story dikhana bandh karo yaar hindi cinema
what does thedi medi meaning?
Nice
Ye kya bawasir bana diye
Mithila Palkar...oh my god! what a stunner you are!!!!
Thanks netflix to realease on my birthday 😭❤️👍
So happy that it’s based on odishi dance...
toxic parent-children relationships ... about time we made a story on this deep dark toxic space
1000% vahiyaat h🤮🤮🤮
I really appreciate Netflix for choosing these legends for what they are worthy for👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️👍
Looking very similar to movie Shakuntla devi
Kajol always superb ....
If movies are &quot;Rajma Chawal&quot; then Kunaal Roy Kapur is the &quot;Dahi&quot;
Odissi finally gets its moment in the sun...
All time blackbuster telair
Feeling proud by seeing odishi costume in this film.. Our culture is to save our culture... Love this trailer...
It&#39;s disheartening that few public has still not awakened, supporting them and make them rich to let use this money against our own country. Not right. Bollywood is run by the bigg D, drug mafia, plz public come out of all this show business and fantasies
Only and only for kajol. 💓❤️
strong story
kuch kehna he nahen paraiga abhi
Nice
Content 😘😘😘😘
So the Vidya balan movie where the mathematical genius is shown from the point of view of the daughter. Really dissappointed at kajol.
huge hit
मराठीत ही बनवा ही सिरीज ज्यास्त hit होईल
Directed by Renuka Shahane !
So Can Netflix bring SRK-Kajol back too?🙏
Kajol 🥰
I am big Mithila fan . Congratulations for your new film .<br>Hope to see you in many more.<br>Loads of love and really excited to watch this movie .
Will watch it for the one and only.. Kajol 🌟
Wowwww
Looks interesting and heartwarming
Kajol ma&#39;am is so natural ... U r the lady Amitabh Bachchan of indian cinema ... Fabulous ...
Kajol is the best. Period.
इतना वक्त हो गए लेकिन काजोल की एक्टिंग बहुत ही खूबसूरत है। अमूमन काजोल की जगह बॉलीवुड में अब कोई नहीं ले सकता। ❣❣❣
Odishi dance makeup main 🔥🔥 dikh rehe ho mam ❤️
ଓଡ଼ିଶା ର ନୃତ୍ୟ କୁ ଫିଲ୍ମ ରେ ସ୍ଥାନ ଦେଇଥିବାରୁ ଧନ୍ୟବାଦ
Kajol mam you r looking awesome,eagerly waiting
Can&#39;t wait to watch this epic blockbuster 😍 Kajol.., Tanvi Azmi.., Mithila
Kajol is a clear example that senior actresses can work , actually better than some senior actors . So no need to pair lead actors with age difference of almost generations
Is it coming on Netflix
Acting will be good..baki sb faltu niklega😆
Im so excited for this!!
I can sense a crazy emotional roller coaster incoming...
My love Kajol💞is back💞
That mom is all alone and scattered....<br>She requires a love......a love of having a daughters ❤️
This is Renuka Shahane&#39;s second film as a director and first Hindi directorial. ❤️
feels like shakuntala devi part 2
Here After Sapman Khans Tweet.
Kajol is outstanding 💃💃
Ilove kajol
Mithila with straight hairrrrrr💜💜💜💜💜
Mere lomte khara hogaye

We love you Kajol ❤🥰 Can&#39;t wait to watch the movie!!!! 🥳 Super duper excited! 🥰❤
काजोल जी को beef बड़ा स्वादिष्ट लगता है।।
Kunal Roy Kapoor came a long way. Great actor
When Kajol do a movie, I know the story line must be have a good quality. She is so selective. And btw, Kajol&#39;s beauty and her natural acting,  are enough to light up the movie.
Weoow
She is looking awesome in odishi dance costume..❤️🤗
Welcome back Kajol
Now we can  expect good stories from Netflix only,not from  fucking Bollywood
She is amazing. Can&#39;t wait to watch this movie,!!!
Yuvraj singh movies bhi krne lga h?😮
Wonderful world for Kajol❤️<br>Love from Indonesia 🇮🇩
&#39;&#39; Ab toh cut gaye na <br>Coma main chale gayi <br>ha <br>ab ghumo bina taar ke <br>WIRELESS &#39;&#39; <br>Wha a funny dialogue by Kajol. Thanks to Netflix for making such a Masterpiece .
