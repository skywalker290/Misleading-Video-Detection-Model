Is it the note 10 or note 10 plus?
The oneplus 7 pro was really amazing
I love the DVD/cd color
Ugh... typical click clickbait garbage with thumbnail
Nice video!!! As always very informative channel!!! New subscriber here !!!
Is it dual sim?
One of the best color  Samsung has ever made
I guess I love that aura glow it&#39;s very beautiful I love the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 definitely an amazing phone
Love my note 10 still
Iphone also didn&#39;t include a headphone jack. Or even a charger. But I don&#39;t actually see people complaining. Just as long as you have  a Iphone you have reputation... Pathetic.........
Watching this on note 10+. The colour is white.
This is 2020, are you still using the Note 10 plus? I have a mac 27 inch 5k desktop. The reason I have the Mac is because is so so easy for my picture editing and navigation of my pics. Everything about the mac helps me do so much with my pictures. I also have an iPad which I love. But if course I have the Note 10 plus which is a beast of a phone. I am considering switching to the iPhone pro max due to being able to have all connected, ecosystem if you will.  I use my phone and computers for work so the phone holds me back a little because for example I use applications that my note can&#39;t use of course. Any advice please? I am confused ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Something about him ripping off a fresh new wrap from a fresh new phone is so satisfying.
Should we need a s pen for samsung s20
2020 i&#39;m still using note 10 plus
Every Lew&#39;s thumbnail: iPhone 6 = disappointed face Samsung note 20 ultra= disappointed face  <br><br>iPhone 12: happy face
You switch to 200 phones everyday. Make up your damn mind
Me watching again this on Dec 2020,<br>FINAILLY, I&#39;m switching to The Galaxy Note 10.. :(

Is it better than the note 9?
Im getting this phone for my birthday fs

Why write 10. That&#39;s a lie. You seem to get a lot of viewers including myself so why the need to say N10 when it ain&#39;t. No wonder how you have that many subscribers...or was did you forget to give its full name(Plus).<br><br>Honesty is getting expensive these days!!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjcrsTEMt-s&amp;t=90">1:30</a> I like that color, I have Note 10+ in black. Wish I&#39;d a got Aura Glow.

Your on note 10 the ora glow I so colorful but when I other youtubers that unbox it like mkbhd and ijustine the ora glow is less vibrant it by any means that samsung did it on purpose or is a little accident?
I have a s10 I really love the front camera but sometimes you can&#39;t reach the close/√ó thing in some ads but if we ignore that its alright

I just bought a note 10+ because I have been waiting like 10 years for a 7&quot; tablet that will fit in my pocket. It pretty much happened and I didn&#39;t even know until a few days ago.  Never expected it to be a phone.  This thing has like 6.8&quot; screen and it&#39;s way smaller than I ever imagined possible for such a large screen.  Gonna take like a week to get here and I can&#39;t wait man.  got an iphone 11 right now but returning it....this thing is like 5 years behind the note 10+ that things crazy.  Time to finally switch back to android after like 4 years of apple phones :D
New phone comes out lew&#39;s like:-ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
We are boycotting China mobiles.. please Suggest best non Chaina  mobile for Indians

Recently I bought a Note 10+, (SM-N975U) the AT&amp;T variant. The challenge I&#39;m having is that I&#39;m unable to update to android 10. It has failed the OTA and Smart switch options. I went on Sammobile and downloaded the version of the OS for my variant but it wasn&#39;t for AT&amp;T it was USC.. Can you or anyone else on this thread help me please..?
I Have This Phone It&#39;s Really Amazing
Thank you very much for your review! I just switched my iPhone 8 Plus to the Note 10 plus. Your correct bigger battery, better screen and storage! ü§© Cheers
That color is Aura Gay
Do you sleep with your cap on?<br>Just Asking üòÅ
Is it still worth it too get the Samsung note 10+ now even though the new one is coming out soon.
you are getting my attention with so many great product reviews. love your content.
Still don&#39;t understand why people keep whining about a headphone jack. I&#39;ve been using bluetooth headphones since 2008 and I&#39;m happy I don&#39;t have wire drama anymore
SAMSUNG Call it üíµTHE NOTE SERIESüíµ Because of the 2100 $ Note‚Äôs it Retail‚Äôs for in Australia.üí∞üí∞üí∞
I been watching this guy for years, but didn&#39;t even noticed that I wasn&#39;t suscribed to him , finally did it üëç
Have you seen the S10 / Note 10 120 hz refresh rate? <br>(Any S10,  s10+, note 10, or note 10,  running android 10 and one UI 2.1. Phone must be HD+ or FHD+ screen resolution for it to work. Download activity launcher from play store and search for &quot;motion smoothness&quot; in the activity launcher.  Once you select motion smoothness you will have the option to change refresh rate from 60hz to 120 hz)
your switching to samsung another sheep in the herd  its time to unsubscibe
It‚Äôs not gradient it‚Äôs holo simply Nailogical would not approve of it being called a gradient when it‚Äôs clearly a holo
Love u
I love the color
Your phone is so cool
The fingerprints hurt my soul.

I have Note 10 plus aura glow
Is this the Note 10 or Note 10+???????
yo yo yo
I am so confused. He is terrible at reviewing phones he say not to buy the phone then says it‚Äôs good then says I am switching to it. And the thumbnail is just arrrrggr
Samsung did raking the headphone jack away the right way, though. They collared with AKG for better audio. Then, they realized their speakers sucked so they bought Harmon Kardon.

Samsung missing the opportunity to call this color Unicorn Poop makes me sad.
Do you still use this phone? Do u still love it? I‚Äôm thinking of switching from my iPhone to this one. Ty!
So which one? Is the s20 ultra better than note10plus..im confused, want the memory the note has, but want the camera space zoom of the s20...
I have the note 10+ I have to admit I am definatly impressed by this phone, it&#39;s a powerhouse,  they just need to work on swype texting,  make it more accurate... that&#39;s my only gripe...

Do people like reviews like this?  It makes me feel nauseous.
Just moved from my pixel 3xl to my old Galaxy s5. It&#39;s half the size and has room for an audio jack.
Just plug the earphones in the usb/audio/charging port...that&#39;s what I do
Remind me of Limp BizkitüòÅ
Why are tou so negative ?
Next video i am switching to telephone

Listening to Lewis&#39;s voice in this video made me think that he got a cold
Can I have the other phone sir? I dont have that much money to buy new phone. Please?
I&#39;m on my Galaxy Note 10 5g right now!!!!
I thought this video is about the long time  experience of the phone but you are just talking about shit.
I just got  My Note 10+ and money well spent worth every penny and more , I&#39;m a very  indecisive  person and I had no problem switching to this phone from iPhone 11.

Stopped watching when you said you don&#39;t use the key feature of this phone... The pen! Watch videos about what the pen can do and you&#39;ll love this phone even more
For anyone complaining about no headphone jack, a usb c to 3.5 jack adaptors cost like 3 bucks.....
SAMSUNG galaxy note 10+‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
honestly the note 10 has me ready to leave my iphone xr behind
My question is this small enough so I can use this single handedly while I&#39;m fapping.
Subscribe to my channel plzzzzzz
&quot;You can charge your butts, right on your phone&quot; ... Cool
Lol üòÇ people make so much fun about Samsung but lots of people when the note 10 came out switch to Samsung
Hey what&#39;s it like handling so many phones and most importantly all those boxes‚ò∫
Are you crazy, The Galaxy Buds are WAY better than any AirPods. And the Galaxy Buds+ thats about to come out will take that to another level entirely. I HATE the design of the AirPods and that stupid little thing hanging down is annoying as fuck, plus they fall out when you do any kind of strenuous activity like working out. The Galaxy Buds NEVER fall out and are extremly comfortable. I also like the sound quality of the Buds over the AirPods. The case design and features are better than the AirPods also. I don&#39;t even like the AirPods pro and still prefer the Buds over them. They don&#39;t have noise cancellation but I can&#39;t hear shit when using them anyway and the ambient noise feature is WAY more useful to me than noise cancellation. The Buds+ will have 12 hours battery life and ever better than the already stellar AKG sound.
Ive seen this guy switch to a new phone 10 times now
Why is everybody on YouTube who review products put their hands over their face?
Want to have this üòçüòòüòò
Give me the note 10 please
Shut up you wet wipe
Lu, can you pls stop putting your hand when you are changing to samsung devices...
I upgraded from a old ass note 4 to a 10+<br>Not impressed at all with the 10. LOL<br>Cams barely better. lots of annoying things.

Absolutely amazing decions you life will get better trust me
Watching this on my Note 10 Plus 5G
watching on my note 10 in white, a stunning powerhouse!
I am one of the many samsung fans. My first samsung galaxy phone was the s4 but I had some issues with it from that note 4 note 5 now note 8 I believe I will skipe the 9 and go straight to the 10 plus. My opinion of the 9 why I am skipping is that it&#39;s not much of a difference from the note 8 only more ram more processor and more memory  to me it&#39;s not really much of an significant upgrade compared to the note 10 plus
I&#39;m currently using the samsung galaxy note 8 since January and now I&#39;m thinking to switch to the samsung galaxy note 10 plus. Is it worth it?
Coolyy4
Can you be specific with your titles. I&#39;m searching for Note 10 but yall suss cause thats a Note10 plus ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I&#39;m here because its harder for me to buy a phone than a house or car.. Its like a second right hand for 2 years... There&#39;s no going back... Its with you 24-7 ...do not mess this up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjcrsTEMt-s&amp;t=143">2:23</a>
Nice, but now you can&#39;t keep your phone charging while using the headphones unless you do wireless charging.
holy f man! <br><br>too many words....you use too many words
The OP crew right now: TRAITOR.
Why look so disappointed?
I don&#39;t know why I just watched this
My uncle bought one a few days ago. And the carmera is sooooo gorgeous. Its like a professional photographer took pictures of me in an arcade. It was just playing around with the camera features.
I upgraded a few days ago from a s9 to a note 10+ this phones unreal üëåüèΩüëåüèΩ
I swear this dude makes at least 3 videos and at the and saying I hate this phone I‚Äôm switching to...... and then the circle continuesüòÇ
i would love a note 10+ 512gb version but want to keep the functionality of Samsung pay. When i contact samsung they describe their phones as &quot;regional&quot; and wont answer if a US phone will work out of country. Is this how pathetic companies are becoming where the device wont even work in another country? Especially a PDA device meant for business owners who are clearly going to travel.
Dat clickbait though
The feeling where he is deciding on when and why he switched meanwhile I want to switch but cant afford a new one
Your gay
What if a phone that has a projected display instead of an oled display. This could reduce refelction to 0 percent. What do you think?
Stop looking soo disappointed because like it&#39;s still a good phone (the thumbnail)
Why is this dude like 40 dressing/talking like every 16 year old fuck boy ever yikes
I just switched phone,, I&#39;m watching on my note10! It feels lighter even though it has a bigger screen ,it looks nice !it has a sharp&amp;clear pictures&amp;videos! I like watching videos on it! <br>It&#39;s not bulky either üòä
Oh seem the smartphones YouTubers..take note 10
I don&#39;t know what to buy I&#39;ve watched so many of these reviews on all kinds of different phones I want the Asus Rog but you can&#39;t get it with Verizon and I&#39;ve looked at the Galaxy 9 or S9 note the Galaxy 10 plus the Galaxy 10 note I just can&#39;t make up my mind I need to get up off this galaxy j7 it&#39;s a good phone but I need to upgrade
Well is there a follow up?
That Aura glow is the shit! The only preiter device is the green fold!
Humid/Damp Signal notification..  drives me crazy
I&#39;m getting a galaxy note 10 for my birthday
Thanks for the video...  Just purchased Note 10+ a week and I&#39;m lovin&#39; it  üòçüíï
Who even dislikes

Can I have your old phone
the one plus looks like a baby by iPhone and samsung
Still no review?
Aww can I have it üò≠
I have and love this phone kids at school might say ahh you have a Samsung like bro my phone is literally better than yours you dont understand how good this is my phone can charge your little iphone 8
Why does everyone hate Samsung so much??
I&#39;m a student, just graduated high school. I&#39;m using note 8 and I&#39;ve been using it for more than a year. I can say that &#39;The Pen&#39; is very useful for me in terms of taking notes and documents. Also, it&#39;s a plus for me because I&#39;m into drawing and calligraphy and it works very well. I don&#39;t know in your case, tho.
What&#39;s with the UK plug on the charger?
Please do asmr
This reactor is a big piece of lying shit!!

So many people switching to the note 10 plus. Such a great phone. Futuristic design, fully featured and really good specs.
PLEASE HELP!!! Note 10 Plus or IPhone XS Max, which should I get.
Just got mine love it!
Mine didnt have a micro usb-type c adapter in it :(
I decided to get the note 10+ because of your videos on it
I dont think your profile pic of this video gives a positive but more upsetting first look! I just switched and I am extremely happy with my switch, coming from an iphone X.
Even Unbox Therapy watches Flossy Carter.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjcrsTEMt-s&amp;t=47">0:47</a> i cant zoom that much when i am watchingvids like that what did u do to watch on full screen
What kind of review do you do actually ?
Pelling plactic of  :me ohhhhfff
3 monhts he going to iphone 11 bc bla bla bla
Why is he getting so many dislikes on videos? Is it because of the later case thing???
Ooooh... he&#39;s doing it! LOL! :-D
Christmas pressie!!!!!! /\
What a dumb video! All this time to change a sim? What a waste!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjcrsTEMt-s&amp;t=166">2:46</a> he looks like michael myers
It&#39;s time to CHANGE
ive been a subscriber for a long time now i hope you could give me one your phone as a christmass present thank you it could help me a lot
I have the note 10 and it is AMAZING so idk what you are talking about.Your actually tripping
double the price of oneplus hell no
Why everytime covering his face when switching to a new phone? Wtf üòÇ
Should i get this or the iphone 11 pro max?
I wish I had this phone... but too expensive. I sit on Youtube and watch people review the newest technology with my cracked iPhone 6s plus lol. üòìüò©
Unbox therapy....I have seen your reviews of this phone and for the oneplus 7 pro. I&#39;m trying to decide between the 2. The main factor Is the expandable memory factor. My question to you is how important is expandable memory really. (I use my phone for my main mp3 music player.) I respect your reviews and opinions so would appreciate your considerable opinion on which phone to get. My thanks.
I love how many fools and in how their phone was stolen...how do I describe it? Duhhhhhh! If you let someone steal your phone, you need to worry about life and how you take care of your stuff.
I need your s 10 plus to buy
Don&#39;t see why people care so much about the color of a phone seems like majority of the time you&#39;re gonna put a case on and negate that anyway. i suppose maybe a see through case? but does anyone really have the brass balls to carry a 1k+ phone with no case at all ???
When he changes a phones he makes a video but when i change a phone i call people to tell them I CHANGED A PHONE
where the review at tho?!?!
Note 10 plus demo unit buy or not buy
Best of all time note
August 2019 Samsung Note 10+ 256GB $1100 . <br>November 2019 Samsung Note 10 + 256GB $699.00
Why does he peel the plastics off ?
I am enjoying my note 10plus
Who do ALL the new phones have to be such fingerprint magnets..?<br>And as always:<br>NO JACK, NO BUY!<br>And don`t start talking about dongles, what is this? 2001?
My s8+ is almost at the end of its cycle
Private mode was best than secured folder we want private mode on upcoming samsung phones and dont want secured folder
After few months I‚Äôm switching to galaxy S11
Please let us look longer at the phone examine it closer (ex width edge screen etc close up) and repeat the other type of phone u had when u talk about it (not all of us have time to watch the entire video and skip through it ..)
Watching this on my note 10+ üòÜ
Hahaha why u hide that Asian charger prongs lol
The Note 10 is worth every penny! I actually prefer it to the XS Max and pretty much everything else because Samsung can be trusted
I like no headphone jack
I just got the S10e and was somewhat considering the note 10 since it had a crazy $400 off black Friday deal. I don&#39;t think the note would&#39;ve been all that different then the s10e besides the pen but I&#39;ve already had many situations so far where I feel like the pen would&#39;ve been really nice to haveüò™
I just bought the note 10 it is easily the best phone I have ever had. The only thing that would make it perfect would be the headphone jack ‚òπÔ∏è
Omg. My husband and I are so ready to drop Apple for something new. And I think, better yet I know. This is going to be our next phone.  ü§óü§óü§ó
Few bucks? Note 10+ is a $2000 phone lol. That&#39;s like two months rent for some. Prices of phones are getting outrageous.
Hi sir just need a genuine opinion I&#39;m planning to buy a phone which one do you recommend <br>Note 10 or 11 pro
You can connect a computer mouse and keyboard on Note 9 with the adapter, sure the Note 10 is the same. It pretty nice. I&#39;m pretty sure you can also connect ps4/xbox controllers too.
You guys follow Flossy Carter too?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjcrsTEMt-s&amp;t=142">2:22</a>üëÇüòç
It&#39;s best phone ever
Why you never give us your opinion bout the phone?
Me too mate
great job. Now I need to buy it! Price alert has been created on Couponsfromchina already. ;)
Is the ugly rainbow finish the only option?
Who&#39;s watching this video from Samsung Galaxy Note10/10+?
Why does it matter so much about a minuscule hole punch at the TOP of your phone, the screens huge and you‚Äôre going to be staring at the top edge of your phone?
Where is the follow up to this?  What do you think of the Note10?
<b>My phone:</b> Samsung S3 I&#39;ve had since january 2013  <br><b>Also my phone:</b> Battery lasts 40 minutes full use. Freezes, shuts down, glitches, no volumen buttons, no turn on button, can&#39;t even hear music from the speakers<br><b>The phone I want: T H A T</b><br><b>My bank account:</b> barely 20$<br><b>My eyes:</b> tearing<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, my Samsung&#39;s the best, You know what means 7 years and the screen is not broken???<br>I should be on guinnes records.
Could get your old phone
I got the note 10+ 5G. No regrets
One feature the note 10 plus doesnt have is you cant listen to music via USB in your car or play spotify via usb in your car, you would think a 1200 dollar phone would be able to iPhone 7 could do that just fine. Oh and the bluetooth is terrible all it does I stutter, piece of shut phone I already regret switching from an iphone to cheap ass android
I switching to ...SAMSUNG
Why do you look like you hate it in the thumbnail
Now every one change to galaxy
Month later: samsung galaxy 10 has problems
Something weird with this video.<br>I opened the video according to the title, which is note 10, not note 10+<br>Note 10 has only 25W charge<br>Note 10+ has until 45w charge, but in the package comes only 25w so you need to buy 45w separate<br>Note 10 has only 3500 mah <br>Note 10+ has 4300 mah<br>Note 10 has note a cover case in the package<br>Note 10+ does
this guy is rich but still care about few extra bucks
same thumbnail for the 10  smh lol
I just upgraded my note8 plus to the note10 plus. Samsung never disappoints.  This phone is superb.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjcrsTEMt-s&amp;t=144">2:24</a> oh man I loved
I like how you have to restart this phone every other day otherwise it turns into a piece of shit in your hand. or how the camera barely work in low lighting if it works at all. LOL
It&#39;s crazy how this guy is still using Note10+! It&#39;s been 2 months.. WOW.
The corners are too pointy
How can someone say the Samsung is ugly?? It&#39;s the most beautiful phone I&#39;ve ever seen!üò≥ Maybe some haters.ü§îüòÇ
Unbox Therapy??<br>I thought i subbed to you months ago!!
Anyone else notice that accent change?
atleast you&#39;re not an iphone guy
Lew, where is the follow up video???
Samsung * MISTAKE No (Headphone Jack) No REASON not to go back to iPhone!
<b>I T S   T I M E   F O R   A   C H A N G E</b>
So uh, where&#39;s the review??
dont care if it is the best phone in the universe, no audio jack, no buy

You switch phones like drawers
For everyone who whats to know the name of the color its chrome ITS FUCKING CHROME STOP USEN THE COP JOKES UR NOT EVEN FUNNY SHIT ITS CHROME
The whole note series is fantastic,  all around beautiful phones.
Never ending tech.... phone tech are growing faster. Just use it till it broke to change by new one.
Switches to Note 10.<br>Then never gives a review. <br>üôà
I got a question so I‚Äôm using an iPhone XS Max and am switching to Samsung note today which do I get note 10 or note 10 plus
I&#39;ve had this phone for 2 months now and I can say Meh.<br>My note 8 is just as good and has some better features. <br>Note 10 still has some issues and the battery life is pretty crap. I was e expecting some upgraded battery but what a big disappointment.
Oh no pixel is the best remember why not the 4
where is the phone review? like after you used it for 2-3 weeks?
I went from a Galaxy s3 to a iPhone, after the 7 plus I went for the note 9 and been happy since.
i wouldnt mind trading the S pen for a headphone jack
Which phone are you using right now????????
No one:<br>Unbox  Therapy:I&#39;m switching
It is time to change. I have been owned the same phone, since   2013, ( Samsung Galaxy S5 my first smart phone, still )
The best mobile
I have both the note10 plus and the iphone promax. I&#39;m not a youtuber, just a regular person. One is for work and the other is for person (although I do switch between the two based on my mood because I love both). Apples ecosystem is hands down the most flawless OS in any smartphone. For that reason alone, I&#39;ll always own an iphone. It&#39;s a bonus that it&#39;s also pretty powerful. However, I hate how limited it is in comparison to the note10 plus. On the note, not only do you have a stylus but you can also customize fonts, your home screen, etc. Both phones have great pros and cons.
I was a fan of the notes but once they took away the jack I switched to the 11 pro max.
So can I have your old phone if you ain&#39;t using it??
this guy and Marques Brownlee are the most confused morons on youtube.. dont buy iphone . dont buy samsung note
I hate how all the new phone have the edge screens,  which are absolute garbage! They crack so easily...I&#39;ve been loyal to Samsung for a long time...but with the new screens and the phone prices...and the garbage new plans for phones...I probably going to look for an alternative on my next purchase...6 months that&#39;s how long my screen lasted...absolute garbage!
I don&#39;t know why people switch phones every year... It&#39;s not like they are completely different. Why change a phone that works just as good?
Android....
Can reviewers stop putting &quot;Note 10&quot; on the title while they are showing Note 10+
No headphone jack? Fuck you Samsung. Fuck you.
Honestly I wouldn&#39;t wanna buy a case if I had this phone
I hate this phone.... unfortunately  didnt know I only had 14 days to decide. Should have gone back sooner. I&#39;m not impressed  with the camera at all. And the stupid fingerprint in the lower middle of the phone screen is so ridiculous....the Samsung&#39;s with it in the back were so much better. This one you have to get it PERFECT on the spot...so annoying
Hey man you always switching your phone üòÇ
What is this dudes accent? Slight ghetto but white.
How the charging port I had a issues  with that.
Just ordered this on overnight shipping and am upgrading from the note 8, hope I love it! ü§û
Great Video. I think samsung galaxy note 10+  is the best phone I ever had.
thank God it has wired earphone! ‚ù§
Note 10 came out in Korea 2 weeks after I bought S10. Fuck I am jealous of the back color!!!
Best android phone I&#39;ve ever seen. F*ck iphone 11 üòÖ
i love this guy, humourous and fun!
Who cares you&#39;re switching or not
Dude have u seen my phone anywhere?<br>No what&#39;s it look like?<br>Kinda like a thin rectangle bubble
What if the pen got lost?
I AM STILL STUCK ON S3. 10 IS VERY FAR AWAY FROM ME
it&#39;s time to change
I love  it  ‚Å∏$‚Å∏

Don&#39;t move back from the note 10 + <br>It&#39;s best of this year man

Whats with the ebonics? Did I miss something here?
does anyone know if the samsung note 10 has a similar or same feature as the google pixel 3 has where it listens to the music that is playing around you on its own and then stores them in a list so you can go back and look at the name of the songs that have been playing around you
We want update on your daily driver
I&#39;m never going to use &quot;wish&quot; app. Cx that advertising really sucks
Is it true that there&#39;s problems with the vibration motor in the note 10 plus?
its been a month now we didn&#39;t get the update!!
For me, being petite, these in ear, earphones, don&#39;t fit üôÑ ..tried them all. They pop out.  This is the most frustrated thing, for me, with phones.
Today I&#39;m switching to note 10 plus from one plus 7 pro...lol
I wanna hang out with this guy he is cool

Loving my Note10+. Just picked it up 2 days ago, definitely an upgrade from my Note8. I&#39;m still gonna use my Note8 as another phablet.
Where&#39;s the +
Stfu with ya corny ass non informative comments
Can we get an update on how your liking it!
this is the galaxy note 10+ !!! iguess no one talks about the note 10
I love that cellphone
Omg I&#39;m still rocking a samsung Galaxy j4
When is he gonna show us the user review of the phone? It&#39;s been a month already!
Waiting for review of Note 10 Plus!!!!
In his thumbnails he gives you the disappointed look because he&#39;s changing his phone again.. &quot;job description&quot; that ain&#39;t the worst thing to do on earth or in a job.
Why in the thumbnail it seems as he if disappointed for doing this lol
i want this
GALAXY NOTE10+ SWITCHING^^
Bruh you have a slot for the pen but no slot for my headphones bruh... like bruh
OMG is a amazing  devices
&quot;yeahh most of the time its NOT gonna be THAT COLOR you see in commercials.....&quot; <br><br><br>Phone: IS THAT COLOR THE ENTIRE VIDEO<br><br><br>lol
Man Lou this has to be the fastest I&#39;ve ever seen you switch a SIM card to another smart phone cough cough Galaxy, weren&#39;t you an iPhone guy?
He is switching galaxy note haha..üòÅüòÅ<br>Guys did you remember same dialogue he was used on huwaei phone
Haha way to buy a non North American phone. Trying really hard to hide the plugs on the charger. Look at em at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjcrsTEMt-s&amp;t=184">3:04</a> man‚Äôs buying Asia products.... no hate here, just noticed and thought I would mention it for the next video.
I got pixel 3a xl and it has an audio jack, reason why I opted out of the pixel 3.
Watching this on the <b>Note 10</b>
Im not buying. I love my headphones jack
People still use android? I don‚Äôt trust green text people...
Friend: what is your mobile colour? <br><br>Me: Good question...
Note 10 on LGBT colour sucks
galaxy interface is garbage
The only reason I am committing to Samsung Notes is the headphones jacks, so FUCK YOU SAMSUNG
The reason they knock out the headphone jack is for water resistance purposes, if you don‚Äôt have as many holes, you have more water resistant capabilities
A big feature dumb reviewers leave out is that xperia uses aptx HD and has been for 3 years. IPhone and Samsung do not. In addition to the 4k which iPhone and Samsung do not have either. I wish I never got duped into buying a Samsung.
One month from now: &quot;I&#39;m Switching To The iPhone 11 Pro&quot;
Now youre an apple user g8
I was gonna consider buying it but it doesn&#39;t have a headphone jack.
I&#39;m watching on a note 4.

Hey lew! Where is the review for note 10. Waiting on it!
I‚Äôm gonna get the S10+ because of headphone jack
This man literally posted a vid just showing himself putting the sim card in

have to use cover to protect against the next time I drop my phone. So much for bezel-less.
So u  made <br>A vid jxt to tell us that u switching phones
I love how he hides his face on all of these thumbnails on why im switching to videos
I never want to see another Samsung phone ever again. Those google apps are horrible. The battery will slow down in 12 months

Why does he sound like he&#39;s from the hood all of a sudden? Like....wtf
Why are you trying to sound black, Canada Boy, eh?
yeah right, till the iphone 11 comes out and he will go right back to the phone that already came out like two years ago
That colour is cool and all but its just not for me. Picked up the white one. Looks sick
This phone design annoys me because that chrome rainbow is so annoying <br>Then if you put on a giant case to cover the rainbow then whats the point of the rainbow
We have note 10+ The auraglow looks very different in person and it honestly looks good (My mother has it). I have the black one though since it&#39;s my personal preference. I do use a clear protective case because it looks nice and I also heard these phones are more susceptible to cracking due to the curvature of the screen.
What is up with the accent in this video haha?
He speaks differently in this video.
Oh my god, no wireless charging, god forbid he has to plug his phone in, lol. I just got my One Plus 7 Pro and the phone is great. This guy changes phones way too often.
Hey Lewis..still waiting for ur full  review of note 10 plus
I can‚Äòt fucking believe it people in 2019 have the fucking need for a headphone jack. Like don‚Äòt tell me you‚Äòre rich enough to get yourself a 1000$ phone but you‚Äòre too fucking broke to get yourself 130$ wireless headphones. I used an iPhone 8 for two years now the Note 10 and I literally never felt like damn I‚Äòm really missing a headphone jack. I usually play my music from my laptop, or through bluetooth speakers why the fuck would I need my headphones while my phone is charging I only use them while walking.
<b>Any phone company</b> : Releases flagship phone<br><b>Unbox therapy</b> : Im SwItChInG pHoNeS <br>No h8 tho lol<br>I will just stay with my iOS 12 iPhone 6

May I have your  Note 10 please after you use as a daily driver lol
You can  just  ship me the one plus
But does it take a SD card for expanded storage???
bs the screan is dark not like note 8 or sony xperia 10 plus

I&#39;m sorry but wireless charging is so dumb when you have Dash Charging on the OnePlus. I do like the idea of just placing the thing down and it charging, but my 5T charges up to a full day&#39;s battery level in 15 minutes. It&#39;s ridiculous that you&#39;re wanting to sacrifice that for less convenience.
Quit saying your switching and being dramatic
How do you fit this big phone in you Pocket ?

Give me your old phone :&#39;(
Hello. I just wanna know what is the watch he got? It looks good. Thanks for  your time
Hi Lewis, please I actually beg of you, when you review the phone, don&#39;t just take in consideration if it&#39;s worth upgrading to the note 10 plus from recent other flagships, but talk also about if it&#39;s worth upgrading to if you have like a note 4 or something similar from that time. As a note fan I&#39;m very biased and loyal to the serie and every note so far missed some feature, but to me at least this seems the most complete package with 3 cameras pumped s-pen fast charging wired and wireless and so on, is it worth the money or not? THANK YOU SO MUCH, your most loyal fan - Tarik.

Who the fuck cares anymore..!!!!????
Apple users tryna talk shit about samsung but have to miss all the cracks in their phone so they don&#39;t cut their thumb
Hey Lew, there is a problem with fast cable charging on note10, it doesn&#39;t woark (exynos version, I&#39;m still waiting confirmation for snapdragon)!! Charging time 10-100% battery needs about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjcrsTEMt-s&amp;t=80">1:20</a>min on note 10 and just about 1 hour on note10+ although it have bigger battery! Tested on two (n10 and n10+ devices). Can you investigate a bit?! So it is same if you charge your note 10 with new or old (from s9) samsung chargers! :( No one writing about this!
It doesn&#39;t have a hole for the aux cord?
did you know? Plug your note 10+ to a USB C laptop charger and there you have it, a 45W charging feature without shelling out for another brick. To make sure, see your laptop power brick for output (20 volts @ 2.25 amps); that is 45W.
Hi
mE: mY fOnE gOT sTolEn...<br>PoLEEce: wAT ColuR....?
sobrang hawig ng sony xa1 plus to. as in üòÇ üòÇ
This phone looks like a unicorn took a shit
The included phone charger is stupid because it&#39;s micro-USBc to micro-USBc rather than the normal standard USB to micro-USBc. So if the cord goes bad, it&#39;s not as easy to replace with an after market cord, and since the included cord is micro on both sides, you can&#39;t use it with any other hardware. It&#39;s not even a nice cord. It&#39;s a crappy, .50 cent cord that they&#39;ll probably try and charge you $15 to replace when it inevitably goes bad.
Can i get the 1+ please?
I‚Äôm switiching to the note 10 today!!!

why does he always wear that shirt now
Hey when are you making that note 10 plus full review?
How fast is reverse wireless charging on the note 10? Is it still 5 watts like the s10?
Good choice
Its actually Note 10 plus, correct the thumbnail!
Go on bell end switch to any new phone that comes out,  its only for today phone!

Hi there. I&#39;m having a hard time getting used to the fingerprint reader on my galaxy note 10 plus. Am I alone?
The phone isn&#39;t that colorful in real life it&#39;s cuz of the high studio lighting making it look so bright and weird, but in real life it&#39;s not that bad
Donate me the OnePlus then üòò
ive had my Note 10 plus for a few days now and im having a blast with the damned thing. I love the screen, i love the pen ( i honestly try to write out my messages with that more often than me typing it all out),  The camera is a nice upgrade from the S8 that i previously had. Its a bit big and tough to hold without a case, i was supposed to get my on monday but the shipping was delayed so its a bit hard to hold. It is slick which is both aesthetically pleasing but sucks when im sitting since itll slide out of my pocket. If i were to give it a rating id honestly give the phone a solid 9/10
definitely buying the note 10+
Don‚Äôt like the gradient  holographic color.
Is there anyone experiencing vibration not functioning properly on Note10 Plus?

I love Note 10 plus
I&#39;ve got the one plus 6T I fuckin hate it just waiting for apple to realease the 11 then I&#39;m gonna drop this
It&#39;s only phone.
Love your review on this phone. I have an S8 plus which I want to trade in to get the new Note 10 plus. I have an odd question..maybe you shed some light on this. So everytime when I get a notification, of any app, and swipe it away it doesnt show an &quot;unread counter&quot; on the app icon anymore like 1-2-3-4 etc. So when I swipe away the notification on top, I wont know if I got unread messages etc. Which forces me either to remember that I got a notification of which app or open all apps to see which one it was. Has this been resolved in the new Note by any chance?
what no headphone jack<br>DO NOT FOLLOW APPLE¬¥S MISTAKES SAMSUNG!!!!!!
Came to say tht i&#39;m switching to other youtube channels
It&#39;s time to switch up the videos, Lew! It&#39;s far too predictable now.

No Linux on DeX, will NOT be upgrading from the Note 9. Appears they are dropping Linux on DeX which is immensly useful in favor of a gimmick feature of opening DeX as an app on your windows desktop which is useless, pointless and redundent.
To me the back colors looks pretty disgusting. The shape, materials, software and hardware are great tho so I&#39;d just get another color.
Definitely helped me move towards getting the Note 10, as I&#39;m due an upgrade now from the S9. Do I go the Note 10 or 10 plus? I&#39;m actually leaning towards the Note 10 regardless of the lack of 5G, let me know with your comments.
....until the Pixel 4 comes out! LOL. But really, if you see the Note 10 in person its a futuristic device. When you look at the features, it has no weaknesses. Put a good case on it!!!!
After 10 days he will switch to iPhone ü§îüòÇ
As Samsung joins the trend of removing the headphone jack, can you help out with doing a search for an adapter for usb-c and aux port that actually supports phone calls (all current available Do Not support phone calls).

In this price, GENIUS one like me will keep 2, NOTE 9(550$ owned last yr) &amp; ONE PLUS 7 pro ( 700$ spending now)
I have one thing to say , this phone is too damn big . I have to carry it in a special holster  because in my pants pockets annoys me and in my jacket as well .People who try to use cell phones as laptops are idiots .
What watch are you wearing?
Next up<br><br><br><br><br>I‚Äôm switching to the next phone that comes out
RGB has gone too far
Did you say type C to C! Dope.
What original content
Unbox the new soundbox
I have a cracked iPhone six and lou over here is changing phones every month
At least you like for a day cause  after a week you gonna hate note10üôà
This 25 w charger is better than oneplus 30 w charger.  Thanks to USB Power Delivery 3.0
Samsung is the best phone ...... in yhe world
Magical gradient??! Thats obviously holographic
Can I just say.... wow its a beautiful designed phone. I love the design
That phone brings a clear cover inside the box that nobody knows about...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjcrsTEMt-s&amp;t=350">5:50</a> I am note 9 now?
Has he always talked like this? I&#39;m hearing some kind of accent
Apple only gives you a 5 watt charger and samsung has 45 watt wireless charging?
I am rocking this phone too. It comes with a case and screen protector in the box so that&#39;s dope
Bold of you to assume I have a phone I can switch.
No headphone jack, no SD card unless you pay extra for the Plus. Not impressed at all, especially coming from the Note 9.
Keep switching ok. You&#39;ll get there one day
Why did you not switch to the Asus rog phone 2?
I had an orgasm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjcrsTEMt-s&amp;t=143">2:23</a> üòÖ
All phone companies: we have no space for an audio jack<br><br>Samsung: let&#39;s put a whole pen in our phones
How can you switch back to a 60Hz display after used a 90 Hz one? xD For me it would be impossible. Using ipad pro and switched to ROG Phone 2 from OnePlus 7 Pro. Never want to see lower refresh rate than 120Hz anymore :D
Unbox therapy: I‚Äôm swapping to the galaxy note 10 <b>face palm</b> <br><br>Me in 2019: Yay an iPhone 4S!
Bruuh. I&#39;m your biggest fan from Kenya. My Note 8 screen cracked and I can&#39;t afford a new phone yet. Please gift me a Note 10/ Note 10+. I&#39;m dead serious. Pleeeease! Looking forward to it.<br><br>Otherwise great content as always.
just get a poco F1! Same shit inside ‚Ç¨300
@Unbox Therapy I can see it in your eyes that you are doing this for the sake of work and not personal preference. It would really help if you answered me this:  Did you face any ghost touch issues with the 7pro? Your answer could save a lot of people from a disappointing purchase. Thank you.
A video bascially all about him changing his to his new phone
Technically, all phones are the same
I want the rog 2 so bad
Meanwhile I&#39;m still using a samsung J7 from 2016
The rainbow for looks like you left it in the sun too long, broke asses need to buy wireless headphones now that you can gettem for less than a 6 pack

This guy changes phones once a month. I switched from s6 edge this year
This is a running joke at this point
What do you do with all the products you test
I came just to dislike for that stupid thumbnail
I don&#39;t understand why this guy has so many followers?
Tbh, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ destroys the OnePlus 7 Pro spec-wise. The only good thing about the OnePlus 7 Pro is the 90Hz refresh display comparing it to the Galaxy Note 10 lineup.
@UnboxTherapy Please make a video on Google pixel4 leaks. Thanks
@Unboxtherapy  u  r always switching sir! What&#39;s new? Please make a new video on Google pixel4. Leaks are in! Thanks

Anyone  from India
Make up you mind
I just switched! Loving the phone.
When he said &quot;the time has come&quot; I thought he was going to say, to lip-sync for your life LOL  ... anyway, let us know what you think, I love iPhone but seeing that disgusting design, who knows, this might be it
This is nothing new. Everyone  switching and dumping boring iPhone lol
Next video... I&#39;m switching to one plus 7T üòÇüòÇ
These are boring now
your phone promiscuity is alarming!!!
Redmi Airdots please....
Please give me your one plus please please
people are getting sick of you doing the same thing every month
I like dat color doe.
Samsung is literally killing it <br>Not only by the pry of Shame battery <br>But also killing support to even USB to 3.5 mm adapters on their no headphone Jack phones (note 10,m40) through the one ui this is literally the end of golden times of android which could roast apple now they just boast apple
this guy is a douche why does he have so many followers
Cord earphones over buds any day.
sir can you give your smartphones <br><br>ia am in india<br>hit like for those who love dew
Galaxy note 10+?<br>1. Easy to break<br>2. Slow system<br>3. Buy iphone 10 ü§£ü§£ü§£
Just unsubbed. My youtube needs a change
been watching allot of your videos and have seen how excited you get over tech, this lack luster video tells me you are getting paid from Samsung and probably don&#39;t even want to do it but all those zeros on that check compels you
I hate those thumbnails so much. And i feel like he does it cause he knows its fucking rank to look at
JESUS CHRIST THE THUMBNAIL DO YOU HATE EVERY EFFING PHONE BRO
Here we go, where the plus version of every phone is titled the wrong way. Says note 10 in the title, not note 10 plus.
YouTubers: Iam to switcing to this phone <br>Me: Still hanging with my $200 phone for 3 years...
After few days he&#39;s like &#39; I am switching to iPhone 11 pro &quot;ü•µ , and keep his hand on his forehead
What is the watch you are wearing in this a video? Please reply as I have asked questions before and you never reply??
My s7 still runs fine!!! At this point... the newest phones work and run apps as good as a 4 year old phone. What is even the point of dropping $1000 on a new phone unless you have some massive ass ego?
Im glad , that you enjoyed Oneplus. i was with Oneplus from first Oneplus One and it is really something different.
I am changing to apple 12
Could you make a comparison of the ASUS ROG PHONE 2 with the Note 10+ and iPhone XS Max?
Why does he look like he lost hope in the world ,in every &#39;I am switching, thumbnails
Why do u look so upset everytime you switch phone?
Wrong title
I&#39;ve done unboxing also my Note 10 plus and I definitely says that it&#39;s awesome with it&#39;s new features!
but the point is you are going to change your device all the time when Iphone releases
What do you do with those phones you don&#39;t use? Can you give me one ??
the back just looks like a rectangular cd
Why do people get so mad at these switching phone vids? He&#39;s constantly getting phones I hope he&#39;s switching. It&#39;s sortve like a series ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The color really sucks. Samsung got rid of headphone Jack. üò≠
My Note 10 plus suddenly not vibrating during calls &amp; any notifications...anybody facing same problem?
Customer: which color variant can I get <br>Samsung: yes <br><br><br><br><br>OK that&#39;s old
Gift me ur oneplus üò´
Phone call has left.
Im kinda <b><i>disappointed</i></b> about the Note 10 series cuz, it <b><i>doesn&#39;t</i></b> have that <b><i>futuristic 5 cameras</i></b> no <b><i>48 MegaPixel</i></b> camera the front camera is only <b><i>10 megapixel</i></b> it <b><i>doesn&#39;t</i></b> have a <b><i>90hz &amp; above refresh rate</i></b> it doesnt have that <b><i>crispy camera</i></b> on the <b><i>P30 Pro and Pixel 3xl</i></b> but hey dont get me wrong, its still a great phone, new features and stuff...
It looks <b><i>SIMILAR</i></b> to the P30 Pro
Why does his accent sound different?
Good switch and send old phone
Ok brother, go ahead
Get well soon... your voice doesn‚Äôt seem the same...
i want to work in unbox therapy .. i m from Toronto.
Can you tell me what the best glass screen protector for the Note 10.
Any tech company: ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôre announcing the ne-‚Äú<br>Lew: ‚ÄúWELL IM SWITCHING‚Äù <b>facepalm thumbnail</b>
That phone would cost me minimum $800 upfront and pay the rest off month by month, or $1700 all in one shot. Forget it!
I feel like every time I see his &quot;Im switching to...&quot; its him looking disappointed
U sound a little differentü§î
Definitely get the Tech 21 check case üëåüèªüëåüèª
Good my mate apple is shit you done A Good Job my guy
Every time a new phone come out this guy makes a video with his hand over his face saying I&#39;m switching to so and so etc. Come up with something new lol. Aside from that good video
I bought this one this morning. I&#39;m antsy towards the price since this is the first phone I&#39;m financing in my life. But, there are several things about this phone that made it worth it; such as the stylus. I draw a lot and having this convenience is great. They also supplied me with earbuds- which ended up being better than the ones I had prior. I also dig the camera and specs.
I‚Äôll buy it if it runs HarmonyOS or iOS
I&#39;m Switching to Samsung Galaxy Note 10<br><br>A few weeks later.....!<br><br>I was wrong about it now I&#39;m going back to iphone.
I can&#39;t get past the hole punch and the price, I&#39;ll stick with the phone of the year, The Oneplus 7 pro.
Yep, another life changing phone upgrade,  buy it and be more productive with your boring calls, boring facebook crap, your boring porn or whatever repetitive entertainment you do on it..   I&#39;ll stick to my 6 year old phone/computer/crap-camera samsung note 4 which I bought second hand for cheap and keep it for another 5 years if it dont break first.    The cost of this thing  is ¬£1000 in the UK which would buy you a 60&#39;&#39; TV and a Washing machine, and a drying machine and new microwave cooker,  just sayin..
The galaxy Note is the future of the note lineup
Idk that color is too much for me the all black is better
If there is no product placement in the video, whole video is product placement <br><br>I‚Äôm joking. Calm down
Can you get ur hands on ur GEAR VR. N see if ur note 10 plus works on ur GEAR VR
Forget the headphone Jack...
Lou, everytime AKG is brought up you speak so highly of them as if they&#39;re this amazing brand, but you do realize they&#39;re fucking owned by Samsung!? They&#39;re mediocre at best.
S10 5g still has headphone jack bigger display then note 10 +
You have money you run channel who reviews phones ... So nothing new man.A new phone pops up n you change.
awesome
Instead of one plus 7 we could buy oppo k3 because all the Chinese phones are same no differences.  But Samsung phones are totally different. So bruv u can&#39;t complain Samsung. And the note 10 is the beast.
Why is your thumbnaill like you are switching to a bad phone üòÜ Its better than you used before in anyway
He&#39;s switching gender for the next entry
Hey man, could you please do a review on Jabra 65t in ear headphones thanks
Lou you will regret it soon. I&#39;ve given up on all Samsung phones. Every Samsung I&#39;ve owned since galaxy s2 has broken from the most minor of drops. I have (after many years) switched to the p30 Pro from a galaxy s8+, the p30 Pro has completely blow me away and I will never look back.
The Samsung Dope 10+ is really amazing, totally loved it!
opened the video because it said Note 10, not Note 10+<br>please be more specific when it makes a difference
im switching to android<br>im switching back to iphone<br>im switching to note 10<br>im switching to iphone 11 pro/iphone 11 max

Can you please switch to the iPhone 11 egen you can buy it
Why are all the thumbnails on this channel so annoying?
No headphone jack. Won&#39;t be buying one. I refuse to pay more for less.
Is Bixby gone? Please tell Bixby is gone (on. Note8 here).
Please do a s10+ vs note10+ . please do the comparison
The notes speakerphone functionality sucks sounds terribly muffled can barely hear anybody you&#39;re going to hate it
Shoutout to White-shoes
You‚Äôre switching because it‚Äôs new.  When something else new comes around, you‚Äôll switch to that, etc, etc.  Congratulations on being extremely predictable.
IT happens when you have a lot of Money lol.
Now for my question. How can you restart your phone when it lags when the power button can only be accessed when scrolling down the notification bar. Standbye and bixy is merged together, so i heard from most people.
Is there a ceramic version of the Note 10+? Or are all of them made of glass?
A few bucks more.<br>More like a few hundred dollars more.
Like hes humiliated or embarred
Make up ur mind
why you hasn&#39;t zur new Soundboks Tested?
You switch smartphones more often than Trump changes his underwear.
Why is always depressed when switching to any smartphone in the thumbnails?

Th note 10 is actually a downgrade from the S10. 1080p screen resolution no micro sd card slot. No headphone jack.
I OWN ALL SAMSUNG DEVICES &amp; HUGE FAN OF NOTE SERIES ,<br>WHO ALL LIKE- üëç<br>WHO DONT LIKE- COMMENT
I disagree headphones are not an  upgrade,  S8  had the same ones but not usb.
I love how he covers his face like this is a shockingly tragic thing he‚Äôs doing üòÇ
can you donate me your one plus 7
He sounded tired of doing this he felt harsh today
Would you mind giving me the One Plus 7 Pro Lol
He shouted &quot;I&#39;m a note 9 now!&quot; .None notieched!?
OH MY GOD HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SWITCHED PHONES THIS YEAR
Sir can you give me your unboxing galaxy Note 10plus  I am your big fan in India .I like galaxy Note series.
Would have been great had the first thing stated on Note 10+ videos was &quot;DO NOT TRY TO TAKE FILM OFF FRONT OF PHONE...&quot;  Luckily I stopped after a few attempts trying to get under the film because I saw how difficult it was to &quot;peel it off&quot; and realized the this may be the same type of covering the Samsung Flip users accidentally peeled off thinking it was just a &quot;film cover...&quot;<br><br><br>Even though I didn&#39;t manage to pull it off, I&#39;m annoyed that the top left and right edges of my screen now looks &quot;slightly frayed&quot; because it wasn&#39;t mentioned to &quot;NOT TRY TO PULL THE FILM OFF THE FRONT...&quot;<br><br><br>Folks, DO NOT TRY TO PULL THE FILM OFF THE FRONT, IT&#39;S SUPPOSED TO BE THERE... GROAN
Ever consider on using a phone for what it&#39;s for? Or do you just care about aesthetics and the &quot;feel&quot; of it
Why is so depressed when switching to an another phone?üòÇüòÇ
Thumbs up if you&#39;re still watching this in 2021 on your Note 12.
he sounds like he&#39;s trying very hard to sound like a blackman
you should try desktop mode on this phone
I like the old phone better
Me: My phone got stolen!<br>Police: What color is your phone?<br>Me: Ever got that star in Super Mario?<br>Police: Say no more.
Why does he always covers his face whith his hands each time he does a video of switching to a new phone
Me:my phone got stolen<br>You:
Why is he talking like he grew up in the hood?
Im switching to the iphone 12
thanks for giving us your fingerprints, dude
Bro That Phone Color Is Homosexual Its A üåà PRIDE ! Are You Coming Out Of The Closet Dude ?
I got mine yesterday. Aura Glow Note 10. It was time for my upgrade anyways. Haven&#39;t set it up yet since I&#39;m getting my case tomorrow. With the line of work I do I&#39;m constantly on my phone . Didn&#39;t want to accidentally drop it. I watched your reviews to make my decision by the way. I wanted the 10 plus at first but I settled for the note 10. From note 8. Love the size. About the same as my note 8. My husband wants the bigger one 10+. Great channel.
I see my  boy  @flossycarter !!
Why wouldn&#39;t you switch to the redmi k20 pro
Yeah it is time to change üòÇüòÇüòÇ
SO IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO USE THE ONE PLUS ANYMORE COULD YOU GIVE IT TO ME PLEASE HHHHH
Big surprise, he&#39;s switching to a flagship.
Soo....Just send 1+7pro to me? I&#39;ll be thankfull to you
Bro.. Need a advice. I have a note 9 512 gb.. And recently i switched to Huawei P30 pro.. I wonder if i should buy the Note 10. I am not really amazed. I owned all Note line phones but now its the first time I am in very much doubt. Thank you. Btw. Keep up the good work . Greetings from Romania.
That thumbnail though! üòíüòëüôÑüôÑ
I love the colour... years of using black phones... like this makes me less bored of the colour, has all yaaaay haha
Me and you started to use it at the same time. Had Note 9 and this is like from... the future. It&#39;s a great phone, well designed and does everything needed and more. Big up Samsung engineers!
I feel like punching him in the face when he puts a facepalm in thumbnail when he is switching to a thousand dollar Samsung Flagship and showing like oh god I have to do it! Really disgusting but have to do it.

Why is this a whole video, just say at the end of another video ‚Äúi‚Äôm switching to the note 10‚Äù
If you don&#39;t like I will find ur location try me
Am I the only person who thinks the aspect ratio on these phones makes no sense?? MAKE THEM WIDER ??
I got the smaller note 10. Tried to switch between the focals (trees) while covering the lenses with my finger to know which one is the wide, normal, and telephoto. I found that the lower one never works! Zoom is handled by the normal focal lens!! Plz verify.
*Note 10+
Ditched the Bixby button at last.  Just one more step to go and include a &#39;delete&#39; option for Bixby and I&#39;ll switch back to Samsung.  Or...release a &#39;no Bixby &#39; phone and drop the costs ¬£100.00

PLEASE TEST OUKITEL K9 it has a 7.12 inch screen for under 200 bucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You pay for what you get in samsung. It&#39;s the best overall phone if you&#39;re willing to spend for the quality.  The phones improve a lot every year. It&#39;s like they compete with themselves instead of look out to compete with others. This makes everyone chase them.
He&#39;s gonna switch back to iphone 11 when it&#39;s released lol
You talk so dumb
Every time a new smartphone is released you say you are switching s8 s9 then s10 <br>Man next time change your title.

Just found out that my replacement screen for me and my wife&#39;s  Note 8 is 500 dollars a piece, due to Samsung OEM parts. OLED is beautiful but once cracked its worthless cuz of the screen fusion to the oled. Looks like the Note 10 will be on our x-mas list. Thanks for the great reviews.
Jus wait on the iPhone and doneüëçüèæ
You get mad about the iPhone 7 removing the headphone jack yet here you are, Switch to the NOTE 10 WITHOUT a headphone jacküòÄüò∂ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Finally you switched from that trash iPhone
It&#39;s a big phone with great specs, what&#39;s new, what&#39;s so different, what makes it different from phones in a lower price range, Samsung&#39;s brand on the back ,a pen  ?ü§® üòî  you can tell when Samsung is literally paying Lew to talk
That phone was badass
Oh stop with that bullshit thumbnail already.
Facepalm for the facepalm thumbnail. It&#39;s getting old. Find a new gimmick mate. üëéüèº

can i have your old phone please the One Plus 7, <br>that would be great for gaming I&#39;m still using my old phone Asus Zenfone 3 max 553KL and that&#39;s 2 years ago, My name is Jade im a fan of yours
I got the note 10+, and in bright enough places, you can see the inscreen fingerprint sensor
I love that color.
Lol... Bro can I get the old one plus 7 pro.
&quot;Its a few bucks more&quot; You mean like 500 more? lol
How is the note 10 plus so far
Ugly back üôÑ
Why does the thumbnail imply ppl are going to be shocked? Who are you?! üò≠üò≠üò≠
I think the normal note 10 is far more user friendly then note10+, its look too huge, unable to use one hand.
He always SwItch every pHONE
I&#39;ve been a Note girl since Note 3! Can&#39;t wait for Note 10!
I considered the OnePlus 7 Pro and the Note 10 Plus and decided on the Note 10 Plus. The Note 10 Plus is more expensive but has more features. As an American, I would also prefer not to buy from China if given a choice.
I just watched Engadget review and they r not that impressed with it. Made it seem like ok phone. Don‚Äôt look like a big change to me in style besides the back colors of the phone. Don‚Äôt like the side edges on screen my hand would be always touching the sides looks annoying. Think they even say google pixel phones r better in picture quality. And did Lu talk about price ? It‚Äôs starting at $1,100 that‚Äôs a lot just like Apple. Let‚Äôs see if u talk about price because u complain about apples price
You should unbox a Samsung Galaxy a50
Cool
Is it just me or does this guy sound Latino now little bit, have to go back and watch earlier vids to see if this has always been, Anyway, VIVA LATINO! and this phone looks like it sucks for me cause my hands or &quot;Mitts&quot; are so big that it feels like a remote control in them and I have enough of thought damn things!
But do SMS messages where you&#39;re sending video still compress them and images extremely pixelated?
Wow its just a phone it&#39;s not your life man.ü§£
It&#39;s crap, just like your videos.
It&#39;s too big. A phone should be portable
Sahi bhakchodi krta haiüòÇüòÇ

YOU ALWAYS SWƒ∞TCH MAN
What&#39;s gonna be the next one , <br><br><br>‚Ä¢ There&#39;s a proplem with a Note 10 <br>‚Ä¢ I was wrong about the Note 10 <br>‚Ä¢ I&#39;m switching back to the 7 pro
I don&#39;t like it and I don&#39;t get it. It&#39;s a phone, you use it to make calls and look at the internet when your bored. Why the living hell do you need a $1200 phone. I get some people use there phones for business. I do to and there isn&#39;t anyone out there that could convince me that a $1200 phone will benefit me in anyway. You do not need to keep personal stuff on your phone anyway that&#39;s what a computer is for at your home or office. Kids today are spending there future on stupid shit. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
How do you transfer your data to another phone? What is your best way?

Hey could you do a review on high rise official AirPods?
Damn, I was really hoping you were gonna follow through with your comments about potentially switching to the Xperia 1. Would love to know what you thought of that device as your daily. Plus it&#39;d be something different than the usual suspects, but I get it you have to do what&#39;s gonna reach the most people in your audience.
Im switching back to my Nokia 6310 ! Ill get a smartphone when they are able to teleport me
Nice colour!!
Please do a review video on MI A3 please
Hidious color
Happy with my s10 5g  512 GB. The note 10 looks like a gay ass iPhone where the camera is located, it&#39;s just a iPhone with a s pen to me, I liked the horizontal camera not the vertical look. I guess apple and Samsung kissed ass if Samsung does that corner vertical look on all future devices good riddance Samsung like apple
I&#39;m switching to the newest and best face<br><br>Lew: facepalm
love the thumbnail
FUCCC WHAT A GORGEOUS PHONE. LITERALLY HYPNOTIZED ME WITH THAT COLOR
wtf is wrong with this guy he switches smartphones every fucking month
That would be weird if your content wasn&#39;t predictable and even weirder if I still couldn&#39;t help but enjoy your predictable content.
Reddy cast telugu word &quot;LABAM(profit)&quot; is hindi word give bomb (rayalaseema). Friends are illegal
Why is your hand over your face in thumb nail. You&#39;re too old for that.
Nobody: <br>Not a single soul:<br>         üß¢<br>Lew: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It&#39;s way too gaudy looking. Fine if you&#39;re &quot;flamboyant&quot; or whatever but meh, just give me something that makes and takes calls. This is ridiculous.
I have always bought black phones. As I hate silver.<br><br>I really like this when it&#39;s all colourful, and I&#39;ve pre-ordered in this colour. But I have a feeling I won&#39;t like it as itll be silver most of the time. But if it could be colourful most of the time, that would then be graat
You helped me make the decision to buy the note 9, couldn&#39;t be happier. Then you hit my bitch ass with this. Damnit Lou
Hey lew what do you do with the phones you ve switched from? üëÄüëÄ

What&#39;s so big deal of inserting SIM card into a new phone? That&#39;s what reviewers are supposed to do.

That&#39;s what Barack Obama said, &quot;it&#39;s time for a change&quot; and the only change he did was kill Bin Laden!

I&#39;m definitely getting to know 10 plus I would trade in my LG v40 for the note Plus when I start with a new phone plan.
I always watch your updates usually don&#39;t have a reason to ask questions because I trust your opinion over all other opinions and willie doo&#39;s opinion matter&#39;s.
Hey Lew is s8 still awesome to this day would love your opinion sir
It would be cool if you test the phone from some new manufacturer. Like for example NOA phone from HANGAR18. It is developed in Croatia. Btw you guys are fun and informative to watch.
Stop this kind of thumbnail and clickbait it&#39;s so annoying!
Subscribed and turned on notification bell<br>Now need favour gift me one note 10 plus..<br>üòú
I have to say that the Samsung galaxy note 10 it&#39;s the perfect copy of the P30
