The editor was good
It‚Äôs crazy how the ball bounces so much, fake
They are
Everyone knows that was fake there other video was on outrageous acts of science
Fake because it hits the same place everytime
If this is real, tell me why the shadow of the baseball isn&#39;t there.
FAKE it‚Äôs impossible to have that many hits In the same exact spot over and over again
Fake!
FAKE
Isn‚Äôt that sound like the same commentary from the video of the guy hitting the ball onto a pitch back?
So fakeeeeeee
Fake good editing though
It real but it took them lots of time
People already proved it
They are all fake
Fake
Fake
Tell me how is it fake but I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s real

this is just a way to show of the bat in the video. It&#39;s made by easton and the channel is easton. real or fake
Fake
Fake
Awesome videos but there fake

most of you introverts watch watchmojo

How this fake
out of all the videos in YouTube this is the most obvious fake video
that bat sounds so fake
Nope, all these guys do is make fake baseball vids
I know hes editing because theres a speak on the camera
the way he hits the it should go straight but he edits it to look like it goes up and hit the bat
So fake
They are fake
Fake
all of his vids r fake. i can do that
So fake
where did the ball go??
FAKE
Fake
i just hate when my baseball disapears in mid air
I don&#39;t know it&#39;s fake or not but<br>why the people think it&#39;s was not possible??<br>we did this with cricket stumps<br>it is not soo difficult for me<br>because I&#39;m a cricket player.
they are bating gods
why does his white bat always sound the same
It is not fake because if it was fake or photoshopped it would have no shadow of the ball so therefore it is real
fake in every video the guy says ni way the same way
That&#39;s not fake because I watch a behind the scenes a lots of wrong
fake
fake
Fake
All of his videos are probably fake
Fake
How does it make the same noise every time hit
this is definitely real
No way
FAKE!!!
They forgot sounds
I wish this was real...

Yeah. Nice.
It&#39;s fake but awesome
If the sun was straight up above, you would be right.  However if it isn&#39;t, it will not be right below the baseball.
The shadow follows a curved path so it, on the ground, first goes left and then angles back into the other dude.  Nothing wrong with the shadow.
I hope you all know that it&#39;s supposed to be fake
SEEMS HARD
That&#39;s fucking awesome
Cool
Oh, and its spelled &quot;bologna&quot;. Just so you know. Fuck tard.
Wow. You&#39;re incredibly intelligent.
phoney baloney

take 6,504... ACTION!

Fake look at the baaseballs shadow
look at the shadows - fake ofc
No shit Sherlock... 
How?

i give only 5% of a fuck !
Of course it&#39;s fake. Does no one remember the one (that I think was by these same guys) of a guy hitting a baseball into the spring nets?
There already enough comments about the cameraman so Im gonna keep mine to myself. lol
Yeeeeeah ooooooooooh that&#39;s awesome ohhhnhh sick....what&#39;s the camera boy doing????

Cool video but it&#39;s clearly fake.  
Fake nag homo

That was awesome!!!until I took an arrow to the knee...
fake... but not gay
Can&#39;t wait to see this one on Mythbusters as well.
i cannot see if it is fake or it isn&#39;t
pretty neat stuff
this would be cool if it was real.
aha !
comment sounds like porn
How much faker can this get...
faaaaaaaaake
We here at Pardon My Sports suspect this is fake and have submitted this video to the Stat-Tron 5000, our octuple core super computer and we just got the result: invalid URL. Keep those pads on!
u got a definite point there
Il cameraman Sembra che stia divertendo un po &#39;per molto o ha problemi Breathin
Cameraman alone gives it away as a fake...

E &#39;cos√¨ falso. Ci Idiots cos√¨ stupido

fake not even CLOSE. Geeze, H
ow stupid are we supposed to be?
Lol fakkkkkke

/watch?v=W8SK0rk5jdE
/watch?v=8xU-dmptL0A
shaddup hunjk and go to ur minecraft nub
The camera man sounds like hes having an orgasm. Hahah
That cameraman would be a natural at filming scenes
whats that bat easton surge?
Tennis. ._.
Lol.. Fake.. You can tell at the end you can&#39;t bounce the ball that fast between bats that close.. 
I love all of the &quot;You stole this from Yahoo!&quot; comments.

You bunch of retards, Yahoo! just showed THIS EXACT VIDEO. If you slick on the YOUTUBE link on the bottom right of the video you get brought to this page. 

It never ceases to amaze me how fucking stupid people are. Yahoo! doesn&#39;t create 99% of their content, it&#39;s all taken from other sites.
Yeah u just took this comment straight out of the yahoo article&#39;s comments
GREAT.....NOT FAKE!
 
Ha ha funny shit!!
the speed is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; you can tell they are putting some force into it regardless of if its fake or not. plus closing the gap also makes it look faster then it is actually traveling
i&#39;m pretty sure the camera guy was jackin off during this video &quot;awwww yea... ahhh sick.... yessssss&quot;
Mannn was that gay, and incest like grosss.
Was I the only one who had both videos playing, and heard double of everything the whole time. Like the bat swung at the ball four times.
Well, it&#39;s CG. The ball in the video moves very unnaturally. Also their reactions (especially the camera guys) are fake, they&#39;re acting. Finally, they&#39;re advertising.
I seen enough movies to know that this was all faked with CG. I could tell the ball wasn&#39;t real from the beginning. Doesn&#39;t matter though. It was a good ad and could of fooled almost anyone.
ok. is there a love button somewhere?
i had to mute this,
you got that from the post on the yahoo! story.
Its obviously a viral campaign, look at the channel that made it and the description.
fake or not who cares great vid! 
I saw this clip last year. They re released a fake video? Lame
Fake
funny, now go back to yahoo
Huh.

People said that exact thing on the Yahoo article this video was linked in.

I wonder...
You can tell it&#39;s fake because a ball doesn&#39;t travel that fast at the end when you are barely touching it.
That&#39;s pretty gay.
Holy crap... this shit isnt fake O_O

lame
yes !
Fake and Gay...=3 
Did anyone notice the ball suddenly disappears at the end of the video? Lawyered. 
Riiight, this is as FAKE as Pam Anderson&#39;s tits.
my brothers and i used to do that with a ping pong ball and our cocks.
videoshop
fake but a nice Easton commercial.... 
thats nothing compared to this trick v=k0D_pug7RJw&amp;feature=related
They ain&#39;t got nutin&#39; on Forrest!
0:30 just blew his load
yahoe brought me here.
gave it away? are you kidding me? do you even need to think for one second that this shit is not real?
but will it blend?
The ending gives it away.
also It&#39;s uploaded by EastonSportsNetwork. come on.
This is the fakest thing I&#39;ve ever seen, the forced, acted &quot;Are you recording?&quot; gives it away.Keep an eye on the ball when they get closer and start bunting it to each other the ball makes completely unreal motion.
looool. if this isn&#39;t fake, silicon tits are natural.
just a clever viral promo for easton bats. would be cool if it was real though
 
same people from the other video with the bouncing baseballs off the rebounders!!!
fake, just look at the shadow of the ball and the shadow of the 2 guys. also it just looks fake in general.
how is it fake u can clearly see a ball going bac and forth o.o dead serious go look O.o
A few things are too inaccurate to be overlooked:
1. They are not Asian.
2. That is all.

how is baseball a girly sport? 
With all the ping sounds I find it hard to imagine it&#39;s porn if I was blind
Clearly a viral campaign for Easton bats... but you got me to watch it.  Well played marketing team, well played.

fake and gay
Does kinda look like an Easton commercial considering the uploader&#39;s name and that the bats conveniently landed with the Easton logo up and that the camera guy zoomed in on it.
faker than fake
Porn?
my friends thought i was watching porn
Can the camera guy be a worse actor?
When I just listen to the sound I can masturbate to this
Camera guy is the worst fucking actor
1.Posted by Easton
2.When bats are randomly dropped at end one has &quot;Easton&quot; prominently displayed
3.Obviously attempt at viral video ad by Easton
Conclusion:Obviously fake
camera guys is into this wayyy too much
Look at all the haters on this video. Come on this is real and these are some talented kids just putting in the work. 
Regrdless its fake
Why did this sound like porn?
Come on guys, notice how this is not posted form some college kids Youtube, this is posted from an authentic Easton Sports Company&#39;s youtube profile. Sure it would be hard for kids to do the tough special effects such as a shadow, but for a paid professional it is really easy. This is a camera on a tri-pod but they cropped the video so that they can move back and forth to make it look like a hand held camera. Players in the MLB can&#39;t hit the ball with such accuracy... Learn to think.
People still watch that derpy fuck?  Sad.

Here this is for you: watch?v=64cWzSaiaWQ
this is made by the same people who did that shitty &quot;Ultimate Batting Practice&quot; video. If you know anything about baseball or special effects, you know within seconds that it&#39;s fake. If anyone  thought this was real, they really need to reconsider some things in their lives. 
IMPOSSIBRUUU!!
As a guy that does a lot of special effects, its very very hard to mimic the shadow the ball well enough to make it legit looking so I&#39;m going to say real. 
:facepalm:
i can see the shadow of the ball so is kind real to me n they should go to AGT to audition lol
It falls apart once they get closer together because the motion of the ball is a bit off. And then of course there&#39;s the nice shot of the bats with the clearly visible logo to end the commercial. 
completely real, even yahoo backs it up. good job guys, really cool
why is everyone saying its fake because of the camera guy? like wtf is he supposed to do be jumping up and down being super excited? i mean when you guys were watching it were you screaming or some shit?
even the camera guy sounds fake...

So fake lol. 
Watch the video again, but look at the lower left corner at 0:25. The ball rolls off screen, and I think the other guy goes to pick it up.
Hey Mythbusters, are you watching this? Here&#39;s a new myth for you!
Whoa the bats are so fake!
whered the ball go
This is a perfect example of the comments making the video more awesome. I totally didn&#39;t realize how...relieved the camera guy sounded until I read the comments.
camera guy&#39;s voice is way too clear,  this has to be fake

If i was blind... I would think i&#39;m watching porn....
I&#39;m into everything. Oh, don&#39;t be ridiculous...I have never watched any porn, but that doesn&#39;t keep me from picturing it.
fake and gay
everyone knows that already &gt;_&gt; bit late there
Looks like its a &quot;Easton&quot; payed for viral marketing video to me. Thumbs up cause you know that&#39;s right!
LOL. The camera guy was legit having an orgasm XD lololol
0:29 &quot;awh sick i just came in my pants&quot; 
I think all viral fake videos use the same dialogue. &quot;Are you recording?&quot; &quot;Check this out&quot; &quot;Oh no way&quot; &quot;That is sick&quot;
It is FAKE: watch?v=GLT9_K0WBfM&amp;feature=player_embedded
do not try this at home kids..
fake and gay
Is all commercial purposes
This looked like a scene off of chronicle
It&#39;s pretty clear...that&#39;s all, bye 
Beyond fake. Have them do it again from a different angle. 
any video that begins with someone saying &quot;are we recording?&quot; is either stupid or fake.
LOL u jelly?
no shit
so thats your evidence?  i didnt watch it?
Fake obviously yahoo linked it.

Um did you watch it?
Also notice how the ball disappears after the fact and that there is no circle shape in the sand where it &quot;landed&quot;. Fake. 
cameraguy had cream of wheat 
The breathing sounds like hot gay porn somehow...
fake, look at the hit 0:07, ball has too much arch coming back for it to be real!
Also if you watch closely,the shadow of the ball is to the left of the ball while the shadow of the players is facing the camera. The ball is traveling in a straight line,so we can assume that the artifical light source is at a wrong angle.
The ball has a soft fuzzy shadow, even though it comes as close to the ground as the bat which has a hard clearly outlined shadow.The movement of the ball is too slow to affect the shadow this much.Soft shadows are easier to render and generally produce better results.
Where&#39;s the ball after they dropped the bat?
Does not look fake to me. AMAZING!
this is so advisement  
fake just like my girlfriends tits
do u smell RWJ in here??
The camera guys reaction killed it. Fake and gay
When you hear the typical douchebag behind the camera say &quot;Oh, no way!... Oh man hahaeheaha yeahh!!!&quot;, you know it&#39;s fake.
Fake.
the ball looks so fake...
Its a commercial.
inbetween the guys feet at the end. 
baseball and softball are both girly sports.
The guy recording this sounds like hes&#39;s having sex, since their only men, you guess the rest lol
I&#39;m here because of yahoo editor got tricked from this editing tricks.
you can tell by the guys reaction its fake. 
Where&#39;d the ball go?


clunked bat allows you do this.
idk how i found myself here lmao
FAKE
yeah actually it is also a girl&#39;s sport. it&#39;s called softball
lol. yahoo! brought me here with the ridiculously dumb question: &quot;is this real&quot;. smh.
fake and gay 
The concept was pretty cool, but the execution/editing was poorly done. I watched it once and that was it. You could tell it was really fake. 
it has a piece of string
baseballs a girls sport. just saying.
its like making porn lolll something something somethng is in the house tonight
future millionairess

what soon we will see on j william ray?
Someone has a baseball fetish....
Either its fake or its fake.
why all of you are barking here fake,fake cant tell something else like -nice,nice great idea, well done!
fake and corny.  the camera man is a f  ing dork too. agghhhh yeaah! 
Fake.
Lol!!! You know it&#39;s fake when the video starts off by asking are you recording? That just tells us  these guys can do it whenever they want? I don&#39;t think so.
Yeah i know YAHOO brought me here
Ok so it&#39;s fake. How did they do it?

But where did the LIGHTER FLUID COME FROM?!
black magic
camera man sounds like jeffery dahmer
SOOOO fake, you can really tell at the end when they start bunting....
its fake, it&#39;s really fake this kind of videos
No one can control where a ball is hit to that accurately, and multiple times... It&#39;s physically impossible. You might be able to hit it to them in the perfect spot once, but to do it repeatedly is impossible. 
very nice try but fake because the shadows when they are hitting the ball with the middle of their sticks shows it hitting the very tip. gg no re
It&#39;s definitely not impossible; but...unlikely. 
because it takes many tries to get it right and it was probably like the 6th one and he saw them do it a lil already
cameraman is Jeffery Dahmer lol
camera man needs to be muted
torwards the end theyre not even looking at the ball when they hit it. theyre looking at each other
You can tell its fake when the guy says &quot;are you recording&quot; and &quot;awww yeah thats awesome&quot;, &quot;so cool&quot;. The acting dose not sound realistic to me lol 
Fake, the guy with the camera isnt nearly as impressed and doesnt sound natural in his reaction
Sounds like a porno
If you can&#39;t tell this is fake, then you are an IDIOT.
At :23 you can notice the ball falls faster than normal and the direction of the ball is altered
fake made with After Effects. Same concept as the cell phones popping pop corn or the guy sliding down a mountain into a kiddie pool.

it rolls to the left at :26
and where is your evidence?
if yahoo sent you here give a thumb up
Clearly fake, c&#39;mon now.
seems fake
Preach it!
No fucking duh its an easton ad , look at the channel we all are on....holy shit....
Reminds me of Ganondorf and Link.
Faaaaaaake
would&#39;ve been more believable without commentary from the camera man
Interesting how Easton is the uploader and they&#39;re both using Easton bats... Methinks this is a marketing ploy!

Oh, and that camera guy really needs to stop making those orgasm noises.
Obvious fake.  Here is the evidence: the guy far away started off the volley which is exactly what you want to do if you want to fake it.  Also, the ball conventioneer rolls out of sight at the end while the cameraman or some guy off camera throws in a real ball.  Finally, the bat has no visible vibration or anything when the closer guy hits the ball.
Where is the ball at the end of the video?
fake

Was just thinking the same thing... O.O
.18 seconds. He hits it high and hard. Then the ball appears low and slow. Fake
fake and gay
FUCK YOU
so fake
Well NOW he does, geez.  Never crossed my mind until you said it. LOL
maybe if the camera man didnt sound like 50 year old pervert watching a teenager undress it would be more believable
yea DOOD, hes fucking breathing so hard and shit...wats his fucking deal
Is it just me or does the camera guy sound like he is going to bust a load on some ones face?
Always same tips. Obviously, it&#39;s fake !
fake....          ..next!
&quot;Are you recording?&quot;   
Fake... they aren&#39;t asian!
So fake...
Very Nice Ôºº(^o^)Ôºè
That was a cool commercial for Easton. They must know the guys who do all those Powerade commercials.

Not bad, but now let&#39;s see you do it blindfolded.

JK, this is just about the most awesome sports thing I&#39;ve ever seen.
