<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=118">1:58</a>
Pewdiepie has learned more about Minecraft in a couple months than I did in well over a decade. I must, say I&#39;m impressed
This is why I turn off fire spreads lol
Lava used to be so annoying on Minecraft. You would make lava dumps like Felix to throw stuff you didn&#39;t need in, and they would end up setting fire to wood that was like <i>five blocks</i> away.<br><br>I believe they&#39;ve fixed this now, though.
These last few minecraft episodes are just like the last days of school because it is all fun
when Minecraft grease fire goes bad
so we are just descending into madness now
Ik this is late but this may be scripted. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=151">2:31</a>. I’m assuming a 2nd player (maybe the 2nd account to film his 3rd person pov montages) went invisible and lit the house, but accidentally holds a fishing rod.
100M subs and he posts laggy video in 720p
Ingvar is Creepus Kreist, suffering for sins of other creepers 😂

Ingvar was always one of us...

Pewdiepie fans: &quot;Who set the mansion on fire?&quot;<br><br>Pewdiepie: &quot;It was me Nineteen Year Olds, It was me all along Ninteen Year Olds. You all bought it, you all bought it Hook, Line, and Sinker. Even Edgar bought it. Even my immediate family bought it. All of you were made fools of.&quot;

at exact <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=80">1:20</a> I saw flying fire did you,reply
Is he doing it in creative mode.
i like how pewds said it was a simple elevator and he says its done and i can barely see how it works
he could have jst place water and it would stop -1000 IQ to remember it after 6 min
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=210">3:30</a>, when it burned down. He just loaded up a previous version, right? He didn&#39;t rebuild it? Anyone else think he&#39;s a little sus?
Ppl watching pewdiepie for the first time be like “ what the ......😦😶
Not gonna lie miss PewDiePie old house
so he is using creative
Pewdiepie :this Redstone is very simple <br>Mumbo-jumbo:yes yes YES HAHAHAHAHAHA my plan worked perfectly
STOP KILLING CHICKENS
Felix what is that floating fishing rod in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=151">2:31</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=152">2:32</a> ? huhhhh
Instead can u build a TNT Cannon
Why so laggy
yes
He is obviously going to create mode
Pewdiepie got karma xD for killing chickens
Ingvar: kidnapped, their friends murdered, tortured and sodomised. Somehow they&#39;re the villain in this whole situation.
Where&#39;s ulla britta
Jack Black got into his house again
Burning of Alexandria colourized?
Ingvar’s living is best life with those chickens

Do you know about nether arrmoor
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=705">11:45</a> why do you have a stack of obsidian and piston?
i am better than dream lol
I&#39;m surprised Ingvar hasn&#39;t died from entity cramming yet. maybe its because of the fences.
I love how he used Banjo Kazooie sounds for all of the &quot;dialogue.&quot; It&#39;s very appropriate lol.
They way ain’t workers is vErY simple <br><br>Yea I totally believe you
Da creeper is so dumb

Looks like someone wasn’t subscribed to ibxtoycat

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=150">2:30</a> look EXTREMELY CAREULLY theres a person invisible holding a fishing rod
Do a video showing all your tattos and what would you like to do more (that cannon the greatest swedish invetions)
Wow evolution is real
Pewds created the most complex elevator when there are even more simpler one&#39;s.
how can not die
I see invisible player <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=150">2:30</a>
Villagers: &quot;help us we&#39;re still inside the sheep!! We haven&#39;t eaten in days!!! We have been stuck at that frick chamber for so long and the food isn&#39;t coming down what&#39;s going on?!?!?!&quot;<br>Pewds: &quot;G E T  I N  T H E  B O A T !!!!
Sven is a god
This is unironically more entertaining that got season 8
What is the song playing when Ingavard escapes??? Can someone pls tell me?
What caused his house to burn down?
pewdiepie i need holy water
Imagine if someone didn&#39;t tell him to bring jöregen #1 and sleep at the nether
F F F F F in that chat
He could just build a tnt cannon instead of a whole readstone building.
At the beggining he didnt even knew how to play minecraft and now he builds a fuckin elevator. I cant even activate a piston.
the disaster happend when the watersheep came
can’t wait to tell my grandchildren about a legend called pewds
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=464">7:44</a>, I never imagined a chicken sucking off a creeper, but now ... whoa!
noo the chickenss
Pewdiepie: very hurt, starving to death<br>Pewdiepie: so this is my elevator
from a noob redstoner to a guy that knows redstone that i cant even do in creative bc it confuses me to much
this is 10 episodes later after Sven&#39;s Bf dies.<br><br>coincidence? i think not!
My favorite game from now is the poop game
carma case it happend right after he killed themmm chiken&#39;s
council of beetroot did this
I think he was in creative multible times this episode. What if he didnt make the meatball in survival
Plot twist water sheep caused the house fire
This man is the new mumbo jumbo
PewDiePie pet (sven) is the bast pet in minecraft
Is it just me or is there a floating fishing rod at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=151">2:31</a>
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo two years later nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=535">8:55</a> I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!!
That&#39;s why we don&#39;t play with fire kids
Me: OMG SVEN DIES <br>Pewdipies eyes: YES THIS IS WHAT CLICKBAIT DOES TO OUR FAME
Does anyone have a theory as to how the fire started? I doubt it was the lava tbh
I have a question.....what is he defending himself from???
You can tell when pewds is in creative, he zooms it in so you can&#39;t see the hotbar lol
holly shit man
Sorry about the house
Now guys you have to believe me. If you are a Minecraft veteran then you know how hard it is to find slimes. Felix doesn&#39;t even have a slime farm which is why I&#39;m almost 100% sure that he goes in creative mode to get the stuff he doesn&#39;t have.
Gaymers?
10 on 10 acting pewds
i love how he reacts
awards need to be made<br><br>.Creeper blows up something that pewds wanted to destroy anyway: memorial made of stone<br>.Creeper stops a mob from killing sven by blowing up: memorial of iron blocks<br>.zombie stops skeleton arrow from killing sven when he is on 1 heart: becomes as powerful as watersheep and gets a temple
W3ll i saw this vid on the year this vid ws uploaded whe sven was on fire i was like what the
Where did he get all that slime
I&#39;m a chicken
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=766">12:46</a> what episode was this?
how do you time stamp-.
&quot;this is a massage to all the creepers watching&quot; said a creeper fricker.
What is the song that is playing when Ingvard the Creeper escaped???
My Friend*Imagin a creeper wanting to hurt pewds <br>Me* that’s gonna hurt
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=86">1:26</a> u noob you could put water lol
did he set the whole temple on fire by himself?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=757">12:37</a> omg when was that
the rawknee games made an elevator way less space taking and better
Remember how he first said: &quot;what&#39;s this red stuff&quot;<br>And now he&#39;s kind of a redstone expert
Wait the minute where is ulla britta
Sven falls one block <br><br>PEWDS-EEEEATT. EEEEAT!!!!
&quot;so cute...! I mean CODE RED&quot;
Me:mad at my siblings taking my stuff<br>Pewdiepie: this is worse than my house being robed in real live<br>Me: how how??Why
Love how tired you were rebuilding that 🤣 forgot where camera was 🤣big brain 🧠
This was 30 fps wth
Pewdiepie &quot; I love you sven my dog&quot;<br>I thought your dog&#39;s name was edgar
I can’t tell what’s a meme and what’s real now...
or After you realize there&#39;s bees in minecraft. Im sorry im bad at English.
How you Got! honny block before for you realize there&#39;s bees in minecraft
idk why but I love the way he says &quot;&quot; to anyone inconveniencing him at all
why does he look like dr strange in this episode.
How did he get so many slimes ?!
Water sheep did it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=727">12:07</a>  WTF
It&#39;s funny when pewds fail LMAOOO hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=317">5:17</a> i was like ‘PEWDS EAAAAATTTTT’
please do a tutorial on the underground glow stone swicth light
pewds: is it true that you corrupted my mind<br>council of watersheep: no<br>pewds: understandable, have a great day
My question is was he cheating because how did he get that much slime
BRUH
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=572">9:32</a> When you try to cheat on an Exam but you end up getting the wrong cheat sheet LOL
I miss Minecraft series about first episodes
Sven is a Undefeatable creature he never dies
When his house was burning and he found diamonds<br>: I take that
Ingvar turned into the new watersheep when he dies pewds gonna be like &quot;he was like father to me&quot; and then hes gonna make like 3 monuments after him lol.
I think thumbnail was changed.
Laid
We need more cows, sheep and pigs again!
notice at 1250 he has lots of items at full stock so he must have gone into creative
Swedish Man is cursed by the legacy of water sheep.. the water sheep always loved him till it&#39;s death even though he harrased him to his Death... It&#39;s the curse of water sheep...<br>It&#39;s the curse of disliking unfounded love...
Pewds making a tnt cannon
I almost had a heart attack in the first 3 minutes
Remember when Pewds&#39; biggest concern in Minecraft was buying Gucci pants off a villager?
ok pewds to be honest u did that fire thing right ?? i know
the funny thing is, although his house is on fire, he aint even sprinting
PewDiePie: Anytime a creeper blows something up Ingvar will pay<br>Creepers that hate Ingvar
Nice start
Anyone else watching this video on 3fps
2 30sec flying fifhing rod
Pewds look at Bblocks elevator tutorial

Omg I was so scared if your dog died =(
ALMOST all ya chickens can&#39;t move there wings cause they have bin flappin for too long
Right before pewds said “ I don’t care” then my mom said it’s time to eat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=540">9:00</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=223">3:43</a> this is how u look when u work all day and get exhausted and ur a nerd and u go to ur boss and smiles

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=377">6:17</a> looks like someone went creative mode again..
I saw disaster and really wanted a fire bc it looked like Sven would dies

Juice died this day
he might be more dramatic then me....
(ㅠ.ㅜ)
Way has cheken and  fire
I liked better when just simple things made him so happy like the time he found sven :( or when his house was just a little cabin
Pewds so rich he uses slime blocks instead of dirt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=750">12:30</a>
Nooooooo
Attack on Creeper
I think why your house almost burnt down in Minecraft because of the imported honey blocks from the last episode

Hi
There is a fishing rod in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=150">2:30</a>
Poopdle
he do be in creative mode doe
the feels tho, it happened to me one time. burned my house. 🙁
It almost seems like he purposely wanted Sven to be blown up
felix:we need a defence.<br>4lso felix:has a dirt wall.
Was the fire staged? He wasn&#39;t taking any damage, and if he had fire resistance then he would&#39;ve also known there was gonna be a fire.<br><br>I mean, ig he wouldn&#39;t stage something that would destroy his house, but idk.
How does felix know these things
can someone explain how to make pewdiepies elevator or pewdiepie pls give me tutorial for the elevator cuz i tried making it it wont work everything just goes super fast the block doesnt go up idk if im stupid but i listend to pewds the observ and stuff
it reminds me of i torcher Jerry
Anyone else just binge watching his Minecraft vids on a playlist lol.
He could just open the old saved file instead of rebuilding it. Lol
Who saw that fishing rod flying?
when the villager said :oa a o oi oa a oa oi ,  i felt that
Y
I got a nametag for Felix. <br>Mumbo#2
Need more in 2020
I should say Pewdiepie is so damn creative!!!
Plz give your world download link
Even pewd&#39;s PC lags due to the fire. Minecraft do something 🙏🙏🙏
That’s so sad he said he just finished the interior and it got on fire
Joergen in so happy
&quot;This is a message to all creepers watching this video&quot;<br><br>The creepers: 👁👄👁
Anyone saw that when he was burning he didn&#39;t take any damage😀😀😎😎
pewdiepie: i made an oopsie in minecraft but i will never do it again, pewdiepie promise<br><br>also pewdiepie: brakes a redstone comparator with a chiken by just touching it and covers his hearts as he did in the oopsie episode
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=446">7:26</a> is he on creative mode?
I got sardines when Sven got on fire but I glad Sven didn’t die.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=44">0:44</a> He’s on fire but not taking damage?????
I found a PewDiePie phone case advert right when I clicked your vid XD
Do you remember feigi stolid person
this series used to be A guy trying to get sheep in his pen, remember.
who ever does this makes felix sad and quit
pewds i have never seen bigger bags under your eyes, im pretty sure i could shop at a mall and still come out with half a bag
I love the app and the new version has been a good way of keeping my brain on my own mind to get the app and the app I have for the app and I have been able for more years now I can not recommend this game for my friends to my own app I have to buy a few of them but it won’t be a great app for my iPhone to get my money and it is still not worth the time of my time with it and it has been
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=151">2:31</a> a floating carrot on a stick
I cry
New idea: pet totem.   Bind it to your pet and when they die use the totem to bring them back
That was DEEEP not Sven
I remember this day :(
Its obvious that he used creative mode in this episode
Do you copy the world
No inventory showing

imagine how different this series would be without a sheep getting stuck in water or pewdiepie’s audience saying That he can go in the nether with joergen.
I think herobrine did it
Minecraft&#39;s real life firefighter
Question: why did he not take any burn damage?
Pewdiepie never says good morning gammers
Ожидаем!)))))
Hiiiiiiiiiiiii

FELLOW FLIOR GANG THIS IS URGENT MR BEAST THREATINED PEWDIEPIE WE SHALL BATTLE
Now just imagine of he didn&#39;t want to separate his sheep so he could dye them so he could make blue and yellow wool. Everyone was saying, imagine if the sheep didn&#39;t get stuck in the water. No, imagine, he didn&#39;t dye his sheep.
When he is building the gun outside of the wall you can seee a sheep face building what is that
Wean  he  klli
Sven  I  get  happy

pewdiepie: ahh my house is burning<br><br>me:[shouting] get water idiot
What he’s still using gold boots
I don’t think this is how the game was meant to be played.
Pewds: I need someone to pay.<br>Pewds of the past: In the old days we used to just torture a random sheep or chicken.
Any one notice he is on fire and he isn’t dying
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=446">7:26</a> he&#39;s in creative because he broke the block instantly
Did anyone see the add at the end???
He doesnt even get damaged anymore
Tidying my room

Some won prank you. Because I saw a fishing rod in the air
im enderman not creeper ok trodde du att jag skulle vara en creeper   )=&lt;          )=&lt;
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo o have a minecraft in computer no
Pewdiepie should bring a friend here and tell him/her to stand somewhere where the tnt goes then launch the tnt that would be so funny😂😂😂
The dislikes are from creepers.
I&#39;ve been playing Minecraft longer than him and I don&#39;t know how to make the things he makes
,

Hi I&#39;m here for the first time I like his reaction to such things not and he is sensitive to the syenduuk
Does anyone know the name of the opening music because the music sounds so good. I also can&#39;t believe that this series started with a tiny house with one the most famous trees inside it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=712">11:52</a> CHEATA! dat very random? Me think no. (Invetory)

PewDiePie. welcome back to a beautiful day in mindcraft  HOLY FRICK WHAT HAPPEND
Anyone wonder how Felix didn&#39;t die or burn from the fire?
Have a happy bro fist bros
I legit screamed when sven caught fire...
What will happen when Mumbo Jumbo finds out someone else is doing redstone?
When you make a super big house but you don&#39;t know what to put in <br>&quot;Suffering From Success&quot;
Vc use creative si!!
When your house catches on fire in Minecraft, it&#39;s legit one of the most frustrating things ever. <br>With the lava in Felix&#39;s basement, I honestly can&#39;t believe it took this long for it to happen. And I&#39;m also surprised he just covered his basement up with his new house instead of filling it in.<br>Double Fs in the chat for his Minecraft house.
See how Felix kept two hours later template and said it took a day. Maybe a Minecraft day or not
The legend says it all start by punching trees
Well I&#39;m a sven
Wait. Whatever happens to Sven after ingvar escapes?
Hahaha não tem tradução para br
did anyone saw floating carrot on the stick floating on air? I did
Hang on if this is click bait again I&#39;m gonna be mad
He looks like ferb with his hair up😀
pewds: i will not cheat again that is a pewdiepie promise<br>also pewdiepie: /give username Minecraft:honey_block 10<br>then in the later episode he said that he does not know how to make a honey block
Wait did Sven die??!!
Subscripe Sarkar 33
Why he not burning tho 😐
U should do a bubble elevator 😉
The ghost of Watersheep came to destroy Felix.
._. ._. ._. ._. ._. ._.
i wish watersheep was here and i wish that Felix did not hate watersheep
/donat
This is the END!!!
I felt so bad for Felix! All his hard work with redatone...
I will kill sven revenged wht you did in my house
When did he get so much slime!?
Water bucket: I&#39;m waiting to call

The mental lag is brutal
Pewdiepie : welcome it is a beautiful day in minecraft <br><br>Lava : imma end this man whole career <b>burning his house</b>
Water sheep angry.
Instead of building a gun couldn’t he have just gotten a normal bow and shot the chicken
SVEN!!!
Council of water sheep is the kid of water sheep
Did the house get struck by lightning
Imagine if Felix actually turned fire spreads off
Pewdp your game tuber simulater is very good but it is related to date and time of mobile so when we change time of tge mobile the game changes too so we don&#39;t need to spend our money to skip or play Gobble and Poggle and the game doesn&#39;t understand that we cheated.

Moral of the story:<br><br><br><br><br>Never kill chickens....They could set your house on fire .-.

This is prestons worst fear xD
Stap creeper abuse ✋
Pewds must have a Civil engineering degree

The villager is right
Don’t keep lava in a wooden house
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=285">4:45</a> he cut the time the creeper would have exploded...
You are the most subscribed channel Pewdiepie
The house fire gave me flash backs from the Australian Bushfires

<b>These videos are so sad now that I know Sven fricks his own son later on...</b>

WHY NO JUSTICE FOR JEB_
Que bueno como arde el perro puto team rubius
Why wasn&#39;t he taking any health when he was on fire, he wasn&#39;t even losing half a heart?
Lol 😆 bad base
and apparently pewds is now mumbo jumbo level redstone
the fps tho lmao
<b>When PewDiePie knows more about redstone than Grian</b>
just call the fire<br> police
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=150">2:30</a> look to the right carrot on a stick hmmmm
Nonono you all got it wrong<br>Everything started because we complained to him about him playing no games. There for gaming week happened
I would honestly rage quit and like stop playing for like a month
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=531">8:51</a> felix look like dr strange from Avenger
Pewds: <b>houses burns down</b> I will never financially recover from this
Pewdiepie: I like to abuse creepers.<br>PEDA: is that an opportunity?
This is very important! you need to kill the chickens that are in the cage with ingvar. If too many mobs are crammed into one block they will suffocate, so the chickens might suffocate ingvar the creeper.
Is it just me or in this video does Felix look like Doctor Strange?
Pewdiepie:using a axe wile trying to put out fire so he breaks his house <br><br><br><br><br>Big brain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why do he has fire damage off??
After he says it makes not sense and when he jump down there was a fishing rode floating
Ok if this happens again this is what you do:<br>-take a minute to assess the situation <br>-there is a setting so that fire won’t spread, turn it on<br>-grab water/ice and put out the fire
not nice video quality
Pewdiepie: Where are all the chickens?<br>Later: STARTS KILLING ALL THE CHICKENS.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=709">11:49</a> I just noticed, Felix has a stack of sticky piston and a stack of obsidian, I feel betrayed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=464">7:44</a> the chickens fangirl over a creeper
한국인들 손!!!@
What happened to the villager thing

PEWDS: made the IKEA tower float into the space, made a freakin simulator, talked to the beetroots, made a tnt tower. <br><br>MOJANG: we need more help.
Omg piewdiepie
Your hair is like standing up😂😂
This is worse than the library of Alexandria burning down
The first five mins if this episode took him a whole day 😭
Why is there a floating pen fishing pole at the time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=161">2:41</a>
Australia
you know pewdiepie a friend kristian ph and go to your house and fire because MChero
Did anyone else notice the random wood when he was throwing boombs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=641">10:41</a>
.
How did he start by trying to frick ingvar to torturing him
imagine if pewds played animal crossing. i fear for the safety of his villagers.
Pewdiepie the red stone god
You can put a dispenser so that it will shoot tnt like a machine gun
Pewdiepie making a bad tnt cannon and calling it a gun is pretty hilarious
Wait a minute PewDiePie why will creepers pay
I’d like to think that he gathered and built everything in survival but..... idk
What is Minecraft seed
anybody else realize that this vid was posted when Juice died
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=190">3:10</a> but how
Why didn&#39;t he take fire damage?
I had a dream of this
1e:50 those are different world !! That means that he shouldn&#39;t be here then that means you cheated ! Or got another villager!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=35">0:35</a> that was proply lightning! Unlucky!
Who else wants to see him play scrap mechanic?
Are we going to ignore the amount of wood he has stacked on top of eachothdr
He has become so good at redstone that it looks like mumbo jumbo
Last ep: people always say I look like sh*t after long minectaft days <br>After building the house for 2 hours: looks like he wants to die
Pewdiepie:wood does not burn very well<br>Mean while in Australia California and Amazon rain Forrest: Ahhh it burns
Every video Pewds frames get worse and worse
You can have hidden lights by hiding glowstone or torches under a piece of half slab replacing the floor in case u don&#39;t like all the torches around the room
ㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ개웃기네
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=150">2:30</a> there is a floating carrot on a stick maybe there is an invisable entity whitch set ur house on fire PewDiePie!!
I have Minecraft
You are the best
Well PewDiePie&#39;s Morning is not good..
It makes me mad that he didn&#39;t just make a water elevator that takes up three blocks instead of taking up half the house with something that took a lot longer and is very loud. <br>But you do you, pewds.
Turning off fire spreading isn’t cheating you know
Pewdipe should become an engineer, Jesus he’s so good
Girls “ugh she’s wearing the same clothes as me”.                                 Boys <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=728">12:08</a>
Felix:* builds difficult confusing gun*<br><br>Me: K but why didn&#39;t u just put a thing that dispenses items and pointed at igvar and put arrows in it?
Kjellberg doesn’t even know how to hit out fires he hits wood 😂
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=546">9:06</a> he had a hat
The cool music at the start
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2lYBUyslKk&amp;t=141">2:21</a> Noooooo you pick up the water from the flow (of the water you just placed)!
