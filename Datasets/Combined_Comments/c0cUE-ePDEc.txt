Infernal james ❤️❤️
no klose?  none at all from Best Game Ever (germany annihilating host brazil)???
2024?
I believe my psychiatrist would tell me to take easy on the 2014 World Cup nostalgia, but I would ignore him. That tournament seems like the greatest football competition ever played.
Spain had a lot of big names still but they were trash this whole World Cup looks crazy looking back seeing their line ups
I wonder what happened to James Rodriguez 😢
Maradona said if Falcao was playing in 2014, Colombia would have won the world cup!!!
Robin van pressie oh my work
James Rodriguez astonishing goal
Mario Goretze for Germany a hundred and twelve minutes
David Luiz exordinary goal
Tim Cahill astonishing goal
David Villa oh great finish
Lionel Messi stylish finish
Messi strikes exordinary
vam persie goal was extra next level
Germany played their worst game of the tournament  in the final, that&#39;s for sure... If Messi played 50% of what he played in the group stage, Argentina would win their 3rd world cup in 2014...
hit by James Rodriguez astonishing goal
Robin van Pressie oh my work
James Rodriguez astonishing goal
Mario Goretze for Germany a hundred and twelve minutes
David Luiz exordinary goal
Tim Cahill astonishing goal

Who is watching in 2024?<br>👇🏻
still came back to watch after 10 years
The Best World Cup Ever,I Love Robin Van Persie Header When Againts Spain,Because Was Iconic ❤⚽️👍
Cahill&#39;s was better than 6th. Would put it 2nd to be honest. That&#39;s such a difficult skill and what a clean strike.
Many great goals that World Cup but is FIFA actually suggesting that Tim Cahill`s goal was only the 6th best of the tournament? It was on his weak foot and the player had to watch the ball come in from high out of the sun. I think it should be no.1.
Easy 7 of germany vs brazil. 2 of lio vs nigeria ,other lio against iran
2024 gangs 💪
Tim Cahill foi o melhor golo para mim
Rodrigues e Van Persie 👏👏👏👏
Cahill&#39;s goal should be higher in the rank.
Anyone knows what the song in the video is?
Where are messi goal vs Iran
Zzzzzzzz
Very amazing
Wow
Donde esta penaldo? 😹🐫🇵🇹
Mario Götze im Finale zum 1:0 gegen Argentinien. Yes, what a goal...to the title, awesome.
Mario Goetze, instead of Götze on the fifa channel...
ERA GOL DE YEPES!!!
Road James colombia 2026😮
I think van persie&#39;s goal was the best.
10 years ago!
Pensar que esto fue hace 10 años (use traductor)
😬😬😬
We Are One fammily love  yoursell
Even though FIFA and media did not give the credit it deserves, that goal has become one of the most trademark goals in the history of football.<br>The most iconic goal I have ever seen on a football pitch.. it was really insane.<br>I am not even describing the goal but anyone with football knowledge who reads this comment would understang whos goal it is. That alone tells you how underrated that goal is.
Messi Messi. Sadly they couldn&#39;t beat Germany in the finals
This World Cup was pure magic.
Song name please
Cahill n van
Nostalgia 😢
For me the best goal is missing: Schürrles 7:0 against Brazil. When you make such a goal in EA Sports FC you get banned from the server.
Wh is watching this own 2023
Maturing is realising Cahill&#39;s goal is better then Rodriguez.
legends say that james rodriguez stayed in brazil
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0cUE-ePDEc&amp;t=80">1:20</a> - This is an own goal. Without the deflection it was a miss
Cahill at #6 is insane
Y forlan😢
The Bosnia defender vs Messi💀💀💀💀💀🤣🤣
Загубил карьеру, переходом в реал)
I dont think cahills goal was better than tha luiz freekick
2014 FIFA WORLD CUP BEST GOAL<br>10. XHERDAN SHAQIRI 🇨🇭<br>9. LİONEL MESSİ 🇦🇷<br>8. LİONEL MESSİ 🇦🇷<br>7. DAVİD VİLLA 🇪🇸<br>6. TIM CAHILL 🇦🇺<br>5. DAVID LUIZ 🇧🇷<br>4. MARİO GÖTZE 🇩🇪<br>3. JAMES RODRIGUEZ 🇨🇴<br>2. VAN PERSİE 🇳🇱<br>1. JAMES RODRIGUEZ 🇨🇴
Una Belleza Inolvidable Lo De James
I still think Cahill&#39;s volley was goal of the tournament. It was incredible.
amazing james rodriguez
Alguien que ve esto en 2023 por nostalgia like si si
Titulo de la cancion?
&quot;It is David Luiz...&quot;
Just imagine Falcao playing that World Cup with prime James... 😢

Colombia lost to Brasil, Colombia injured their best player,  Brasil loses to Germany.

Tim cahill should be one. The playmaking is 10/10 the touching 10/10 the gol 11/10
Quién está mirando en 2023?
Messi is emotion India loves messi
El gol de James es el mejor gol de la historia de los mundiales.<br>Por su complejidad, la forma en que toma el balón casi con el hombro de espalda al arco, sin dejarla caer se la pone de volea con la zurda y la manda a dónde el arquero nunca llegará, pega el el trabesaño y entra al arco. Es perfecto
James was a true legeng. He is my favourite  player
GOL CAREMONDA!!!
Wow
Quem aí está assistindo em 2023?
goal #2 should have been #1
alright. we aren&#39;t up there with the rest of the world in soccer, but we have one goal in the top 10 from this world cup. im from Australia. tim cahill...🔥🔥🔥
2023❤
Background song name?
I was at the Colombia vs Uruguay game with my brother. Two grown men crying when James scored that. I can&#39;t explain the emotion but t this days the best memory I&#39;ve ever had with my little brother. Of course we are Colombians.
Neymar and James lit up the 2014 World cup
The best world cup ever. Nostalgia hits different here
Messi&#39;s Goal Against Iran Should Have Been Here Instead Of His Freekick Against Nigeria.

Debieron quitar uno de messi por el de rrobben q fue fenomenal
Does anybody watching this video in 2023?
Tim Cahill deserves higher
2014 브라질 월드컵이 개최된지 벌써 9년이 지났습니다 ! 그럼에도 이 영상에 등장하는 선수들의 골들은 믿을 수 없을만큼 대단합니다. 특히 이 월드컵에서는 리오넬 메시 선수가 대단한 활약을 보였던 것 같아 메시의 팬으로써 더 행복합니다.
Who&#39;s watching in 2023?
Rodriguez and van Persie 🌟💪
This WC was 4 years after my nation had pass away yes RIP Brasil Futebol 1958 to 2006 we had players to scare other nations now we where luck the against Senegal the game was only 90min with 20min more if you wach that friendly would be another 7

Who is still here after Man City won the champions league final 2023? If you are, have some cookie🍪😋
James on fire 🔥
The Duch player should’ve got the best goal guy was like super man
There is no way that Van Persia header was second  that is a joke that it was second.
2023😢❤ James

I think Van Persie&#39;s goal is better than James Rodriguez&#39;s one
This World Cup was so incredible, even if my country was eliminated in the quarter-finals, between the 5-1 inflicted on the Spanish by the Netherlands, the jewel of James Rodriguez, the superhero volley of Van Persie to the final victory of Germany against an exceptional Leo Messi during this World Cup, obviously passing by the 7-1 of the Germans against the Brazilians, orphans of an equally incredible Neymar. In short, I would so love to return to this summer of 2014 which was so intense, so emotional and so football too. 8 years this World Cup already, and nobody is about to forget it.

JAMES wonder Goal 👌 against Uruguay 🇺🇾 who is watching in 2023
I honestly think Van Persie’s header should be #1. We’ll never see something like that in a World Cup again anytime soon.
Messi fue el mejor jugador de lejos de ese mundial.

Lo de James es un golazo contra Uruguay espectacular
So, No Jermaine Jones but you guys includes David Villa&#39;s goal in this list. Incredible !!

Altho he lost the finals, in WC 2014, Messi was a different beast altogether. <br>He literally carried his team to the finals
What&#39;s the name of background music tho? Anyone knows?

Кто бы знал что в 2022 году он выграет чемпионат мира
Mario gitze😑😑😡
I&#39;m Brazilian and I watched all of 2014 world cup games in family. My Portuguese grandfather told us that flying header goal by Van Persie was the most beautiful goal he had ever seen in his life.
David Luiz hooooo

Oh eh ah!
Qué increíble fue este mundial
Genial... no está ninguno de Costa Rica. El del Capi estaba mejor y el de Joel Campbell! Qué ofensa que no estén!
Brazil 2014 😭😭😭
Tim Cahill should be top 3 at worst. The technique to volley such a ball with such great accuracy is a thing of only the greats.
Song?
Colombia en 2014 era muy buena selección lastima que ahora no es ni la sombra de lo que fue
La FIFA declaró este gol de James como el mejor!! Le duele a la cobarde envidia.
2014 World Cup was special. Coming from a Brazil fan. Forever remember the James goal and the Robin goal
How tf did Messi&#39;s incredible Curve goal vs Iran not make this list?

Golazo de Villa!
For me David Luiz`s kick
Van Persie&#39;s goal looked super spectacular, James&#39; goal I&#39;ve seen repeated on a number of occasions, but let&#39;s admit it, the most technically difficult to execute was the Tim Cahill goal ... anyone that has played football will tell you this!!
Thank you. There are all so fine that the 10th one could well be the 1st!  Ten of the best, really, no ranking needed here.
2018 was the worst cup i have seen by far
JAMES RODRIGUEZ IS MVP OF WORLD CUP 2014... sad to see colombia not even in 2022 world cup 🥲
2014 💔
2014 and 2010 was much better. In 2018 It looked like Nigeria ia playing in France&#39;s jersey.
Jameeeeeeeeees
Hii Me Fromm 2022
Number 1 has to be Cahill, I know you’re gonna call me a biased Australian, but that goal for anyone who’s played the game knows how hard that is to score. It’s basically robin van persies goal for Man U, but take in to consideration that Cahill is a RIGHT FOOTER, he scored that goal with his LEFT, in which he hasn’t controlled the ball he’s judging it from a long ball probably with spin on it, he’s had to of judged it perfectly hit it right in the middle of his shoe and keep it low enough to stay out of the crowd. Literally it’s a world class goal, 99% would either miss the ball or kick it wide, he’s done the 1% while also hitting it with power. Unbelievable goal! <br>The only thing really you can downgrade about it is the fact it’s fairly close to the goal
Have watched Tim Cahill&#39;s goal a million times still can&#39;t figure out how he didn&#39;t shoot the ball straight to the moon, like most probably would.
LO MAXIMO NO SOY COLOBIANO PERO JUGO TAN BIEN QUE LE IVA FULLLL ESA COPA SIN DUDA DEVIO SER PARA LOS COLOMBIANO
I remember this world cup and i think is the best world cup ever sad for neymar that he got injured
James Rodriguez really lit up this WC. His two goals, are both so highly technically different, but both breath-taking (plus, also the commentary on both of them. Perfectly timed great commentary, can etch a memory of a goal on your brain, forever! 😍). Also, Cahil&#39;s goal, on his weaker foot deserves a lot more appreciation for its technicality and execution 👌.
Rodriguez what a wasted potential or was it a fluke?
Back to this legendary video siuuuuuu - world cup 2022
Estou aqui assistindo esse lances! Ate agora nessa copa 2022, o melhor gol foi a do Richarlisson.
Sorry Fifa,Sorry James, but Van Persie&#39;s header was something else.
Where is ozils goal Germany vs ghana
For me persie&#39;s goal is no.1 yess james goal was brilliant but the way that got me shocked was something else man...
Messi  Boss 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩

Who&#39;s watching in 2022 ?😇
I remember the 2014 FIFA World Cup for three reasons. <br>1. Tim Howard was the human wall.<br>2. Costa Rica knocked Greece out on Penalty kicks in the round of 16.<br>3. Germany thrashing Brazil 7-1.
Cahill&#39;s goal should be in the top 3

Beautiful memories
Χαμες ρε φιλε!!!!
Richarlison🥶2022

Es war wirklich etwas Besonderes an dieser WM
Van Persie is better
Some of the goals would be rejected  by new offside technology.

What a wonderful goal from James Rodriguez, a very talented player
That pass of Iniesta was magical 😮
gotta love james🇨🇴
<i>&quot;This comment is read by someone who will be successful in the future&quot; Aamiin - Always Healthy Everyone</i>
#1 goal<br>James Rodriguez <br>He stopped the ball with his chest and then he immediately executed it with his left foot!<br><br>The ball never touched the ground!!!<br><br>Now thats true skill!!!!
i kinda wanna fly emirates now
Why do I remember Van Persie doing a flying header in their orange kit and during a sunny match? Am I the only one who remembered it like that?
El no. 1 debió ser el de Van Persie…un gol increíble
best world cup ever
Van Persie&#39;s classic header should be hands down #1 on this list. Nothing beats that. And i&#39;m not even a Dutch supporter
As an Australian I&#39;ve always said Tim Cahill&#39;s goal was better than James&#39; but if you don&#39;t agree with that then surely it should be #2
Barongsai
Si el del colombiano fue el mejor Aguante Argentina
El de Alemania y Argentina cuando no cobraron el penal al Pipa  Iguain si me acuerdo 🙄 nos re cagaron ese mundial
Van Persie!!!
best world cup

Miss the robben goal vs spain, same game of van persie goal
La concha de tu madre, seguro sos ingles el q puso el top 4
The 10 position in this video is a goal that is similar to the one that got chosen as number 1 in the 2018 World Cup
number 3,4,1🔥🔥🔥
Remember flying Dutchman
Don&#39;t forget the gold match 🔥<br>Algerie 🇩🇿 Vs 🇩🇪 Germany
El gol de James, espectacular.

Se me eriza la piel con los goles de james 🇨🇴
Colombia long shoot are really hard😎😎😎 well done!!! Love from India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
miss u James! 🥺 the first reason I liked football and Real Madrid was because of James! 🤍
James Rodrigues the best
It’s crazy to think that the only player on this list still playing at the level they were 8 years ago was Messi.
Fifa amazing event 🙌 👏 😍
for me, Van Persie lies on 1
El de gotze. Yo lo pondría en 10 porque golazo no es
El mejo mundial
Cahill’s should’ve at least been a 3 or 2
I never understand how enyeama didn’t get to the messi free kick?
Lionel Messy......................The Boss
Só galaços...
Lionel Messi ❤️
James and Persie’s goals were so phenomenal, still remember watching it live with the fam 🎉
James &amp; RVP goals will always live in my heart! I’ll never forget those moments, where I was and the people I was with memories 👏🏾🖤

James club career was meant t so sky rocket after this World Cup but never did unfortunately. However he will always be remembered as the guy who starred the 2014 World Cup. His level was insane
Messi&#39;s second was pite luck

One of the most unpredictable world cups.
Hope Wc 2022 is going to be a one to remember Just like this one. What a wc this was
7 years old and had no Idea what football was. James rodriguez volley was the first goal and shot I had ever see and I fell in love with the sport
Cahill one must be top 3!
van persie goal should be no.1 its out of this world
لا إله إلا الله

2022
JAMES RODRIGUEZ WAS AMAZING
Woh&#39;s watching 2022
messi goal vs iran not being in this is such a shame.
It’s hard to choose best goal but I’d give it to Van Persie because I’ve never seen a goal scores like that .

FIFA World cups should always be held at lively nations like Brazil, South Africa and not in boring and dull nations like Russia, Qatar etc, it ruins the fun.

Netherlands humiliated Spain and got their world cup revenge <br>I was supporting Spain and I felt it lol<br>That van Persie, Robben goal (Netherlands counter attacks) were amazing <br>This is where casillas begin to fall <br>Ramos got his part of humiliation too in this tournament<br>But people forget that every player country has it moments, ups and downs and that&#39;s why cristiano and Messi are legends just for playing for more than 15 years and with a top performance
-
this world cup makes me fall in love with football &amp; messi , messi goal vs IRAN also deserves in top 10 - what a curve 🤩🤩

2022 Todavía Que Golazo De James Rodríguez😱Al Igual Que El De Van Persie 😨👏🏼
Pa eso James?
honestly, I think van persie should be number one
Best World Cup in my life time 100%
Still the best World Cup of all time!
Van Pierse is number 1 though for sure.
I&#39;ve watch this too many times
2014 wc james rodríguez will forever be my nr 1 with henry and both goats
Show
Yooo i have shirt FIFA 2014 but germany
WC 2010 and 2014 are top 5 world cup tournaments of all time in my opinion.
Germany 7-1 Brazil
3 reasons why we remember 2014 world cup: Germany, Germany, Germany. Nuff said, now whine
The plucky whale chiefly license because platinum preliminarily attract despite a silky yacht. arrogant, pushy paint
I have no idea what scoring criteria was used to vote for the ranking, but Van Persie and Tim Cahill&#39;s goals were easily the top two in my book for difficulty, creativity, technique and execution.
Melhor Copa que assisti!!! Só jogaços! Seleções jovens que fizeram história como Costa Rica, Argélia, Colômbia! Saudades!
David Luiz goolta live dekha hoisilo🤪😅
Van Persie <br>James Rodriguez<br><br>Octapus 😂

Of the 2018 world cup, only Pavard&#39;s goal would make it in the top ten of this list. Incredible goals in 2014.
era gol de yepes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0cUE-ePDEc&amp;t=166">2:46</a> the final goal of the world cup which gave the Germans the cup
TIM CAHILL IS 1. GOAL IN THAT WORLD CUP DID YOU SEE LIKE HE IS MUTANT BRAVOOOO TIM
Si
Iniesta BALL for 7th place CLASS
To be honest, long distance shots are my favorite, but Van Persie&#39;s flying header was the most original one and probably the one most people will remember from this world cup.
To me Robin Van persie&#39;s goal is a superhuman finishing. It needs to be number one.
Mejorres goles del mundial
Es lo mejores goles del mundial
Es lo mejores goles del mundial
C&#39;mon.. Van Persie&#39;s goal was the most beautiful one
Van Persie was the best of the lot. <br>No1 was just a Hit and Hope

Van Persie goal I have watched more than 100times still it impress me
Like si pensas que el de  2014 fue el mundial de los golazos .
El mejor fue de James
Back when Paul Pogba won the best &quot;young talent&quot;
The tune brings back so much memories <br>the commentry<br> the players<br>celebration<br>emotions
Cómo se llama la canción de fondo?
Vamos Argentina
2014 world cup =Leo Messi❤️
Messi against Iran was the best goal of the tournament
Hermoso mundial
Brazil ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷
Goetze should be 1 just based on importance
Aeiou
There were some nice goals this world cup. Cahill, Rodriguez, RVP.
Best world cup ever

❤️ GLORIA A DIOS ❤️🙏
I need name of this music
Van Persie is crazie! 🔥
What’s the name of the song?
Whats the name of the song?
2014 was goated
Song?
Falto el de Giovanni dos santos
O gol do Tim Cahill foi muito mais bonito que o do Gotze
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0cUE-ePDEc&amp;t=165">2:45</a> ❤
Top 1🇨🇴😉
El gol de Van Persie es uno de esos goles inolvidables , una firma que se te queda grabada para toda la vida.
One thing I remember about this world cup:<br>In the morning after Brazil losing 7:1 to Germany, when I came to class I remember i was standard 7 then I was late and the social study teacher was already in class, he teased me with &quot;hi Muhyiddin, I know you&#39;re brazil fan and you lost 7:1 hmm&quot;  how on earth he read my mind 😂😂
The top three of the best goals for me are Van Persie&#39;s and James&#39;s against Uruguay
I remember that luiz strike,
the gooooal the world wanted
James Rodriguez is text book pure talent 👌👌👌
Pra mim o Gol mais bonito foi da Holanda
Rip james
This is the same as Messi collection of goals.
falta el de messi a iran <br>🤯
What’s the song been wanting to know for 5 years I see my comment from 5 yrs ago 😪
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0cUE-ePDEc&amp;t=60">1:00</a> friendly fire:on
Surely I&#39;m not the only one who will be having classes during the 2022 world cup and will hide the cell phone to be able to watch the games 👀🔥
This james goal is soo hard damage what the f***, think we never see a goal like this again
Pra mim o gol mais bonito da copa e um dos mais belos que já vi foi do Robin Vam Pérsie contra a Espanha!
James!😭😭😭❤️
the best goal I&#39;ve seen in the World Cup by James Rodríguez and I&#39;ve never seen something like Messi Ronaldo mbape Neymar Ibrahimovic Lautaro etc and apparently no one will do another similar and
pedreiro&#39;s glove goalkeeper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0cUE-ePDEc&amp;t=52">0:52</a>
Bruh James was on fire🥺
You missed messi goal vs Iran
The rotten kale immediately print because flower cytologically tremble excluding a cruel unit. extra-large extra-small exuberant, ossified dedication
No GOAT CR7
My Colombia does not qualify for the World Cup today. I don&#39;t know how but one way or another it will be there. Waka waka vibes.🥰
<b>🙌GOLAZOOOOOOOOO de robin van perse✅</b>
<b>El balón BRAZUKA es Relindo🇧🇷🙌✅</b>
<b>GOLAZOOOOOOOOO de AUSTRALIA 🙌</b>
el video venia re copado, hasta que pusieron el gol de alemania
y Brasil perdio 7-1 con Alemania JA JA JA!
The quixotic product continuously bat because ping electrophysiologically need forenenst a berserk medicine. venomous, sparkling use
Colombia 🇨🇴
Schürle! His 7:0 goal against brasil was insane!
Where can I get this soundtrack?
Algeria_and_Cameroon_match_unjust_Bring_us_back_the_match_where_is_FiFA
In 2022 who&#39;s still watching
James rodriguez
Van Persie is the real flying Dutchman
En güzel golü Muslera&#39;nın yemesi 💛❤🇹🇷
I&#39;m Colombian <br>1James Rodríguez 🇨🇴
O gol do Robben contra a Espanha tinha q tá na lista
JAMES RODRIGUEZ😍😍😍
JAMES RODRIGUEZ😍😍😍
The previous world cups were legendary but for some reason the 2018 wc lacked that extra something that made the past ones special
Benim favorim  rodrigez
miss this time
Realmente esses 2 últimos gols foram espetaculares!
Name of the beat anyone?
Messi right now is 34 but in the World Cup he was 26 and CR7 was 29
Обожаю футбол
T
James is the king
Pra mim o gol do vanpesi foi o mais bonito
call me biased if you like, but Tim Cahill was ABSOLUTELY ROBBED. The technique needed to do what he did is so far ahead of any of the other goals in this list.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0cUE-ePDEc&amp;t=170">2:50</a>
As an Everton fan this is weird. The 2 best goals were by 2 former players for us. One was playing for us in 2004, the other was playing for us just last year. Both great CAMS but very different players.
Nostalgia
I love you James rodriguze
♥️ GLORIA A DIOS ♥️
👏👏👏👏😍
Red Card Of Pepe, Germany-Portugal
James😭
If you are watching this in 2022, you are a legend!! <br><br>NOSTALGIA
james the best
nenhum do brasil?
Sdds dessa copa<br>🥲
James Rodriguez incredibles goals
Best world cup ever!!! 💯
Belissimos gols👏👏👏👏
Colombia gave us a show!
I’m sorry, but Van Persie was cheated out of the top spot here 🤷🏼‍♂️
Para lo que quedaste James...
Numb 1 van persie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0cUE-ePDEc&amp;t=206">3:26</a> Ronaldo copied SIUU from him
El mundial de james &lt;3
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0cUE-ePDEc&amp;t=133">2:13</a>
will always remember this WC as the day goetze saves football
Y Cr7 no jugo en ese mundial o porque no hay ningún gol destacado del disque mejor del mundo
I do not know what you taking about
Don&#39;t say Real
James is bayern
I name them all for club during that 2 decade top 10 era.
What a Goal From James Rodriguez :O
David luiz innoubliable
Soundtrack?
And remember 112 minutes🥅
This world cup best by far the great goals great games great saves filled with entertainment
El de Robin van persie es mejor !<br>Es una definición ÚNICA, hermosa.

No Ronaldo hihi
Back when James was one of the best in the world
Viva florentino y Laporta la chupa mucho
Biggest sport in the world can’t wait for 2022 World Cup 🥰
BEST WORLD CUP BY FAR
We want this messi in PSG
Two words, one foot. The left.
