I remember when I watched it was right on the day it came out and it was right before I went out to get my new passport
i loved this song. made me feel like a baddie. but now logan paul sucks
2015 to 2019 were the best days my life and probably of many others
Imagine taking this song seriously lmao
النكحه😂😂
I totally erased this song from my mind 😂
I remember when I was younger I was proudly part of the logang, watching logan Paul’s vlogs and loving his music and memorizing the lyrics to every song <br><br>I still remember the lyrics and realized I was a weird kid but I don’t regret watching his vlogs<br>I regret not cherishing the old days of YouTube
That fact that I still remember all the lyrics to all of his songs
Hello

Logan Paul sure enjoyed having the woman in his music video as he enjoyed touching her as he was singing in which part of the music video is in a dream sequence.
This is the most cringe thing I’ve ever seen
i didnt know that was bella thorne-
This song should have been made by Justin Bieber in 2010 <br>He only wishes girls were outta his hair
This is a work of art. I miss this period of time
dont ask me why im here
Logan Paul was so cute back than looked like a big teddy bear he’s so different looking now I miss this him.
Logan looks exactly like Jake in the thumbnail.
Logan looks exactly  like Jake in the thumbnail always thought it was jake that’s I I never listen to it until now cause I don’t listen to Jake only Logan,
I remember being 9 years old thinking he was better then Justin Beiber. Now as a 12 year old I think back on what the FUCK was I watching ?
So cringe
Idc what y’all say Logan Paul is probably the only youtuber who has good songs
I do not know what is this song but i like this song is good good jod jake paul
Anyone in 2021

Oha lan
2016 and 2017 were the golden years. now we are stuck in our home trying to get a throwback to those golden years.
this song = worse than trash
Logan parece un proxeneta <br>Jajaja

Deli

Holy crap, I remember watching this and truly forgot about this song. Also the concept is to funny. I can&#39;t BAHAHAHAHAHA
Me three-ish years ago: <b>Singing along to this while probably wearing a logang shirt</b><br>Me now: W h a t  l a  f u c k
This is the dumbest song and video I have ever seen. Stop singing please just stick to being a sometimes funny idiot!
is she adult strrr??????
lmao I forgot all about this song but the beginning sounds like M.I.A by Why Don&#39;t We lol it sounds the exact same
Oh god, a deleted episode of shake it up...
Samantha
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5A4paFOb4&amp;t=43">0:43</a> ewwww... 😶
i was so obsessed with this song
who in 2021?
I forgot about this song
logan paul biraz abartmamış mısın? sapık olmuş sanki?
I just noticed now that that’s Bella Thorne
ظبطنا معاك
Cringeeeeeee
I forgot- is bella wearing a shirt or nah
2021 any one no just me okay 😂
this song is shittt
Now i&#39;m concerned about the old me that likes logan.
Wtf is this
Now i know why my father would get mad at me whenever I watched this💀
😠
bad
What a lovely vanity project for Bella and Logan. Can we stop with these &quot;music&quot; videos where we just watch youtubers stroke their egos by portraying themselves as sexy and hot and cool? Can we have music where the singer has something to say besides &quot;LOOK AT HOW COOL AND HOT I AM!!&quot;
Im just here to tell you to leave and listen to real music
Still Listening This in 2021
TÜRK ÜM ALHA ŞÜKÜR
