Start of YouTube India flourish 😂❤🎉🎉
Our movies are so overloaded with emotions and lack of reality. They routinely lie, cheat and harass girls. Not sure how all this became normal, need more social themes. Humor on reality, creativity, sci-fi..
😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=338">5:38</a> is literally the plot of DUNKI

That take on unibrow and complexion 😂😂😂<br>Natural response
last 2 minutes monolog of inevitable fight felt like a scene direct out of splitsvilla🤣🤣🤣🤣
&quot;mom will usually defer responsibility to Da-KHUSBOO&quot;.... HAHAHAHA
No matter how much I love ddlj but till date that train scene when Raj and Simran meet, is creepy, and its super uncomfortable to think that some people are too stupid to do this in real life.
Subtitle&#39;s, man
After almost a full decade, this series is still 🔥🔥🔥
&quot;simran despite the occasional miniskirt is a virgin&quot;<br>the ladys a savage bro

Kanan and Andy Samberg are so similar. Both were born to make people laugh
They need to come back to review the Broadway musical about &#39;Rog&#39; and Simran😭
Majaa nhi aya!!
They Were Way Ahead Of Their Time!!
The Unibrow of Kanan :)
Bring back pretentious movie reviews! Now I will go ahead and post this comment on all the other videos on this playlist because I love them!
ab chalo fatafat jiss wire se ye black tape nikala hai usme lga kr aao
First of all commenting on an epic movie  or criticizing it you guys should be asked off because at that time this was all you could get the best of unlike the 2k kids who have zero idea on how days were like back then it was more forward looning for us which gave the same desi parents to accept kids wished eapecially a daughter wish … and yes guys were like then back then to connect to a girl because the society was different we did not have a phone or internet to just send a meme or gif to flirt through .. and a girl asking to fly and leave the house has a gut to it .. hope how many of you guys doing arranged marriage or just leaving relationships coz u had a small fight and do not contnue till marriage and comment about how parents were back then or how kids were back then .. show some respect below the 90 generation you guys do not see real life struggle .. its all so easy to criticize and these youtube videos and all , one day without your gadgets and to earn money through gadegtes you guys will go mad as an asylum ..
Indians love their India but can’t wait to runaway from it and settle basically anywhere outside of India. 😂
I absolutely hate this movie. I absolutely hate SRK and his typical over acting with that nasal voice.
After 7 years i am suggesting plz add subtitles
tf why am i getting this on my reccomendations today right after i turned 18?? so now youtube be telling me that i was not old enough to watch this 7 years ago????
Who else binge watches PMR?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=636">10:36</a> here comes the chainsawman
Still gold in 2022
This never gets old. I watched it when it got released and watched it again, biswa and kanan. Kaafi Mast aadmi log.
KANAN GILL IS AN INDIAN VERSION OF JAKE PERALTA HANDS DOWN
Come back with these stuff. We are bored watching stand ups now
I am surprised how YRF has let this video live all through these years.
Uske unibrow se mujhe anxiety q ho ra
“Mein ja rahee ho guljeet kay paas” 😅
🌬🌬😂😂😂
That slap on Tom Cruise face is so epic...
utterly hilarious. I just went through the entire process of convincing my parents to buy an iPad on my own.😂
Love Kanan&#39;s unibrow to represent Kajal 😂
Miss the days when biswa had hair on his head also he was funny n relevant 😂
you feminist guys are losers - pretty sure you guys are virgins.
Tereko kon bolatha train main chadneke liye!? 😂😂
Please make more videos
PLEASE MAKE BRAHMASTRA MOVIE REVIEW! THAT DESERVES A HIGHLIGHT HERE!!!!!

Guys guys guys I&#39;m ded 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
clear sinuses😁
The best part is their fight😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It&#39;s like calling Shawshank Redemption, &quot;Andy Dufresne escapes&quot; 😭😭
&#39;Turning&#39; a fake moustache to a unibrow was just 👌👌👌
You are INDI-GENUIS 🤣🤣
The last part where they are bickering it&#39;s funny but you know that&#39;s what happens in real life
Bro, this is not fair.. Change the name of the channel to Pretentious Movie reviews
“Bollywoodity”
guys please come back and review no entry
If I do a Season 2 - which movie should I review?
This is still so funnyyyy 😂
First Rahul then Tony Stark; Tom Cruise is always the first-choice-later-rejected actor for iconic characters
man i&#39;ve watched these videos so many times, i still find myself laughing hysterically everytime i watch them
You liberals are ultimate beta losers. If you love feminism so much, you will never ever get laid.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=630">10:30</a> illuminati confirmed ;)
Pringles at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=190">3:10</a> 😂
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=76">1:16</a>  It looks like Karan is questioning his life decisions...😃<br>Peace!!
If Tom Cruise had done this, it&#39;d have been the first Mission Impossible movie for him.
😂😂😂😂
Can&#39;t  believe that kanan did that devin laugh  ( from money heist ) at 1: 55 ....<br>Woahh an absolute visionary.
Me not getting permission for things I like because I’m too prideful to doing religious things when I don’t believe in it. I know there’s gonna be at least one person that gonna criticize me, so I shall say this in advance: shut up, it’s my choice and your words has no influence on my decision, though it does annoy me very much, so shut up.<br>Back to the topic…<br>I forgot…<br>Whatever
👌😂epic
Kanans unibrow 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kanans unibrow😭😭😂
Anyone is still here?
Guest Appearance: DOGE
The couple fight though 🤣...made my day
Start this again plzzzzzzzzz
Please bring this series back. Do it over zoom if you have to. It&#39;s too precious to have died away so young.
I remember how disgusted I was after watching the film one week after it was released, and the friends who had insisted that I have to watch this amazing movie just didn&#39;t get it.
7 years ago???
my dad is not religious nor he cares abt grades wheres our escape
Is someone gonna talk about Kajol&#39;s baddie bestfriend who she complains to in the start?
I believe we’re told in <i>DDLJ</i> that Raj and Simran grew up in the UK—so why don’t they have British accents? Also, I assume the title was chosen so the porno version could be called <i>Dilwale Dulhania </i><b><i>Lay</i></b><i> Jayenge.</i> I’ll show myself out.
she had me at having a unibrow
Creepiness warning 😀 all creepiness performed by professionals 😂
m
Remake it naaAA
SRK ❤️💪
Biswa&#39;s smile when Kannan says tum ek kuthe hi ho🤣
Even Kanan and Kalyan acting out the marriage life skit had more chemistry than most of the main characters of Bolly movies.
Please bring it back🙈
Last Raj Simran conversation 🤣🤣🤣
I deliberately held my horses to not watch Shawshank Redemption until I read the novella &#39;Different Seasons&#39; only to get spoilers with in 30 seconds of this video... <br>My face literally went from 😂😂 to 😑
naari - dvesh  even
Can&#39;t believe this video is 7 years old! :&#39;)

Stupid bollywoodness,silly glamour,bad impact on audience ,chapri actors  and wrong movies ..... I am not interested .sirf gooooooooooooooooooo hain .kin chutiyon ko dekhte rahe.lanat hain .are ha daadi ko bhool hi gaye saale. Last ,yeh kajol aag laga degi ,kitni hot hain.......
Only desi ka inspiration ye hoga pakka🤣🤣
Omg!!! This just keeps getting better and better like old wine
kanan and biswa&#39;s friendship is so cute.
After watching your review, I wonder how did this film do so well? What&#39;s with our taste?
the unibrow😂😂😭😭
Flirting and let your daughter go without marrying.
Why is Kanan and Biswa&#39;s fight so authentic @_@ I can&#39;t stop wheezing cuz this is GOLD
&quot;Clying in the end&quot; should have followed with &quot;crapping in the theatre&quot;🤣🤣🤣
Is kanan wearing a deathly hallows necklace in the end!!😱⚡
The laraaaai lol
Jab 10 th standard tha. tab mujako YouTube ne suggest kara tha meain aise he play list me save karake rakha tha. Che sala badh aaj  YouTube ne phira se suggest kara. For thank you YouTube yaadhe taaj kara ne ke liye 💗💕😍😘
Oh god that was so good🤦🏻‍♀️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Biswa looks so sexxy without his specs
Brilliant.
Kya tatti movie thi yaarrrrr...... <br>Have to see someone roast this movie.
Today my sister told me she wants to go to a college in a different city. I showed her this video. Let&#39;s hope father approves.<br>I never thought there will ever be a day when I&#39;ll have to take life advice from Pretentious movie reviews.
Bilkul Bakwaas kar rahey ho tum donou mujhey to aik bhi baat funny ya on point nahi lagi
Only if I could put in words how much I miss these reviews. 😭
there are many loopholes in ddlj. but that&#39;s bound to happen because it was directed by a first-timer, aditya chopra. the movie only shines due to its moments and the awesome chemistry of srk and kajol.
Hold the fuck up... Andy Dufrane escapes????
Hilarious review ,  you both are my favorite comics.<br>By the way movie was legendary .
That unibrow tho !!!!
Anupama at the end 🤣🤣🤣
Omg...Denver&#39;s laugh at @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=116">1:56</a>....👌👌
NRI 	Nostalgia is 💯💯💯
When kanan said clying in the end, I thought he might end up saying crapping in the theatre
Oh god... This video can get set ur mood ryt no matter what!! 😆😆😆😆😆😆😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Funny why YouTube algorithm is recommending it now ?!
I was rofl seeing the unibrow on kanan
y&#39;all are sorely underrated. i laughed so much loool you guys are naturals
Ab to Pandemic a gaya, ab to start kar do series 2 Bhai!

Kanans UNIBROW is lit!!!!
I come here every ~6 months.
Pakka correct
Super interpretation<br>Apt
Excited to see The Luminaries on the shelf. Watched this movie and it was awful.
It&#39;s like calling The Shawshank Redemption, Andy Duferense escapes 😂
Kuldeep has worst story but nobody complaints,in fact he end up being a bad guy.whatever hero and heroine in bollywood do,their morality is unchecked.
Anu chopra was quite a surprise
😂😂😂😂
That &quot;Khusboo&quot; kept ringing in my head whole day 😂
Please bring this series back😭😭😭
should i assume this meme pic started from here?? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=406">6:46</a>
Have you also still not watched DDLJ
They make such a cute couple😂
What is the point of bringing the deleted scene ?! They made bollywood what it is today and if bollywood wasnt there where were u two ?!!! U dont even know the wearth of your golden talents that brought indian cinema into people,s home around the wole world !!
How dare u to talk about kajol looks , she is one of the most beautiful and natural woman on earth !!
Damn Capital in 21st cent by piketty. A seminal book of our times. Never noticed it before. GG
Ye to 💩💩💩💩hai
The after marriage fight 😂😂😂😂😂😂
kanan and biswa couple goals low key
Chopra Saxena
The slap at the end tho🤣🤣🤣
How is making fun of her eyebrows better than her complexion being brought up in the film?? The Prem Aggan review was funny so I checked this but this is BS.
Fuvking review
Cmon say the same for Sholay now
Mein jaa Rahi hoon kuljit ke saath was the best 👌
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=217">3:37</a> <br>KHUSHBOOOOOO
Why Google 😂
The fact that this became the metric of Bollywood romance says something about India...<br><br>Kajol : I want to go with Raj!<br>Amrish : No. It violates all traditions that were ever invented.<br>Kajol : But daaaddddyyyyy!!!<br>Amrish : No. What will my father&#39;s brother&#39;s nephew&#39;s former roommate think?<br>Kajol : But I really, really, wanna!!!<br>Amrish : Aww...  Mogambo melt hua!  Go on, then.<br><br>Utterly moving.
Deathly Hallows wala pendant pehna hai,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=335">5:35</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=339">5:39</a> notice biswa&#39;s right hand...notice..
God, too borrrriing seriously... It&#39;s been a downward graph since you made Gunda movie review
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=420">7:00</a> finally someone agrees with me😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Come on guys you have to revive this .... We need this in lockdown
You guys should come back 🤣
The last skit is more like mom and son, rather than husband wife 😂🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=548">9:08</a> did he just stick a tape on his forehead to get a unibrow?! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Watch the very last second of the video and you&#39;ll realise why anupam kher&#39;s character was paired with himani shivpuri&#39;s character.. AKAHIR PROBLEM KYA HAI? 😂
Bauji: &quot;Ja simran ja, jile apni zindagi&quot;<br>If...<br>Tom Cruise: &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;
Thank you so much . I am not alone , I have seen this movie in parts on TV will never waste my time sitting down and watching this movie . Bollywood ne BOSe DK chutya kat rakha hai . When I refused to watch I remember Hutiya friends of mine looked as if it&#39;s blasphemy , but in the end good decision .
one of the most important thing I&#39;ve done in my life is to watch Shawshank before visiting this video , relief !
I never found any thing beyond a level in this film which suddenly draws a new line romance or something which makes shahrukh a romance king or something  .For me DDLJ was just a another Bollywood movie with  lots or cringe ,creepiness and illogical scenes .
The fight tho🤣🤣🤣😂😂
That unibrow 🤣🤣🤣
anupama is rubbish. justifying her stupid choices
the fight is epic
now we know who is gonna win if there is ever a fight btw Kanan and biswa <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=614">10:14</a>
I Subscribed where is friendship???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=546">9:06</a> Kanan&#39;s unibrow man 🔥

&quot;Abe ye dictionary nayi h&quot; epic🤣🤣

One thing more in the end Raj is going to London and simran and her family lives in London as well, toh araam se aa jate

I &quot;Miss India&quot;. Hilarious!!!
All these comedians/influencer try to look very progressive and shit, but spreads dick pics 😂

Kanan as Simran in the end is the best thing ever 😄😄😄😄😄😄
Those steps to convince your parents for a trip seems legit...😆😆😆😆
the girl next to her is 10 times better
I don&#39;t know why YouTube recommended this channel so late!
These movies are the reason for the bad behaviour of most boys.
terekko  kon bola train pe chadne ko...😂😂😂
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=413">6:53</a> professional creeps...LOL

Stupid YouTube is recommending this gem 5 yrs later
i m so glad ppl r able to see how shit this moovie was - idk wht the f**k it got so much attention for so long
Could someone please deepfake tom cruise&#39;s face on DDLJ raj
Watched all the episodes of pretentious movie reviews multiple times. Why you guys stopped doing it ? We all are waiting for a new one ..Might be weekly one episode would be a great hit .
They should put a warning message for creepiness 😂 I wonder what kind of censor board we have! How can they even allow such scenes? There will always be creepy content everywhere but I think this is the main reason we need a proper filter in form of censor board but seems the filter is completely broken.
UNIBROW: aankhon ki khidki par ek saaya aa lehrata hai🤣
Please do more of this! Please
The ending post marriage conversation was EPIC :D
The line, &quot;6 mahine se ghar ka khana kha kar pak gaya hoon&quot; hits on a total different level, during this pandemic.
Hit like if you wanted Kanan to throw his unibrow on Biswa during the fight... 😂
you know after 10 year you could review your these videos and find that what I have done in past....<br>btw I am not a shahrukh/ddlj/kajol fan
Kanan is wearing the three hallows from Harry Potter in the credits scene.
it took me 3 years to realize that  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=285">4:45</a> is tanned Karan Johar
This gotta be back, I would love to see more of pretentious movie reviews

Raj &amp; Simran after marriage should be a plot to consider for DDLJ 2 🤣🤣
Hahaha
START THIS AGAIN PLEASE YOU GUYS!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
So every old Bollywood movie is creepy for them....<br>It was shot in 1995<br>Amd that was not creepy or stupid at that time...<br>Bollywood was not at all advanced at that time..<br>Do these reviews  on today&#39;s movies so anyone can relate to...<br>Unrelatable stuff man
Mujhe samaj nahi aata ki kyun apko english mein review dena hotahain..hindi bolna kya paap hain....  Aur vo bhi hindi film ka review English mein dena.... Aap jaise log hindi ko disrespect dete hain bas yeh show karne ke liye ki apke standard bohut uche hain... Shame on this kind of indians..
After Jaby Koay&#39;s reaction!
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=234">3:54</a> that&#39;s a marxist book. omg kanan damn.

Was Kanan wearing Deathly hallows at the end??
Hi there is this lovely bollywood song that has just released , would love it if you can review it plzzz-<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_hbJRNInkA">https://youtu.be/B_hbJRNInkA</a>
instead of putting it as &quot;dont allow this creepiness at home&quot;, it should be &quot;don&#39;t allow this in public&quot;. Ghar pe ma-bauji hote hain rokne ke liye.
Why would dadi be unhappy? Dulhan bane to dekh hi liya bas shaadi nhi hui.
They pinched their cheeks 😂
Kanan&#39;s Unibrow HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This is non sense, a boy annoying a girl and that girl starts loving him what a bullshit seriously... I don&#39;t even like movies

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=412">6:52</a> best warning
India se itna pyaar tha to india me hi rehte na
&quot;Problem kya hai&quot; in the last was a reference guys! Seeing this video in 2020
U look so cute together can&#39;t Stop laughing
Is it just me or Kanan looks EXACTLY like Jake Peralta 😂
Today i m out of the box man !
WHICH EDITING SOFTWARE DO YOU USE??<br>ITS VERY GOOD

The moment I realized that black cellotape is the Unibrow😂😂
Kanan : Randomly picks Capital.
jake peralta quit his job as a detective and now does standup
Kanan Gill - No Eyebrows

Degree bhi nhi hai ... Khana bhi nhi khata gharpe 😂😂😂😂😂🤣 <br>Am dead
Please review kuch kuch hota hai...
Why did you guys stop this series of pretentious movie review
That unibrow in the end on kanan’s😂😂
DDLJ being considered the best bollywood movie in 90s  tells volumes about quality of cinema in india..
Brilliant!!!
Hah....... Gayyyyyyy
Why are focusing so much on kajols unibrow???😂let her be bro
Especially for DDLJ fans! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHnEn43B8-0">https://youtu.be/rHnEn43B8-0</a>
Anupama Chopra was 😂😂
That order of hierarchy is kinda reversed at my home. Mom above dad. Approach dad. He will convince mom😂
You guys need to bring these reviews back!
I never liked this movie, I always found it very over the top in all context. I just hate it
Biswa&#39;s oh my god just makes me lose my shit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=632">10:32</a>

Blloopers and deleted scenes are even funnier
Skip to 9 mins 😂😂had a good laugh😂😂
Behensplaining is a copy of this!!!
Raat ko aaye toh pooch lena ?<br>So he doesn’t come home sometimes ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=686">11:26</a> lmao What does she mean by &quot;Simran, despite the occasional mini skirt, is a virgin&quot; how the hell are the two related???
Comedy with Logic 😀😀😂😂👍👍👍👌👌

😂😂😂😂
Is it just me or does Kanan Gill look like Jake Peralta from Brooklyn Nine Nine. Resemblance is uncanny. Btw love your work.
Biswa was saying ki agar Interstellar mein woh 5th Dimension mein phas gaya toh woh complain nahi kar sakhta ki 3D kitna mast tha. But film dekho toh pata chalega ki woh wohi toh kar raha tha. Woh Murph ko bhi bolta bhi hai ki &quot;Don&#39;t let me go&quot;.
Bro on satya
Indigenous... lollolol
Anyone here during quarantine?
Make new videos!! Guys!! We miss you. 🥺
2.3K people who disliked this are girls who couldnt take a unibrow joke

Well the parents of that generation did tell us Bollywood is shit and it is screwing up Indian culture 🤔
How did I just discover you guys now I am DYING
Omfg. That creepiness warning. XD
This film inspired a generation of kids to see stalking and harassing women as normal and acceptable
Watching in May 2020 just to keep sane. Or am I.

If it had tom cruise,the movie would b like &#39;bend it like Beckham&#39;👍👍
Why did they stop making these review videos? last review 4 year old?? <br>BTW, I&#39;m watching it for the first time and loving them.
Why did you stop doing thiiiiiis? I keep revisiting these videos, which is a testament to how wonderfully written and performed they were. Please restart the reviews!
Yours sincerely. 😂
&quot;Next time when a guy creeps you out, please understand. He loves you.&quot;<br>-Biswa Kalyan Rath
khusboooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
When you grow up and realise how shite Karan Johar films are. 😆
This was the movie which made srk famous and not swades, this tells the mentality of the audience
awww... this is really fun.. and Kannan - you look great... Biswa - you are super cook.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=114">1:54</a> so that&#39;s where denver got his laugh from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23moneyheist">#moneyheist</a>

Oh man. I never get tired of this.

U could comment on total dhamal. It&#39;s one of the worst movie I tried to watch

This never gets old..
Who is watching this playlist again in lockdown?
Hilarious
Omg..that couple fight at the end was too real!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When people have nothing worthwhile to do they make videos like this...
Chahe kitna bhi criticize karo iss movie ko 1000 weeks tak aise hi nahi chali hai....for sure one of th best movie in bollywood

You guys ruined it for me! Can’t watch it again. 😂😂😂
Are u the science students.....??🤔
The cheeks pinching works though
Aankhon ki khidki par ek saya sa lehrata hain. But unibrow
DDLJ Is THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME
Every time some one says My favourite movie is DDLJ My reaction😥😥😥😥😥😥😥<br>When I say I never understood the craze for DDLJ I don&#39;t like this movie &amp; Raj can never ban ideal life partner PERIOD
Logical point when they did show nice ending for anupam  and bua character  becoz person playing  bua character  lost her real husband and can,t shoot further .
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=285">4:45</a> Karan Johar 😂😂😂😂😂

This two are so good that they really let you think on the thought of your fav. Film
this video was sponsored by Googly
Why did u stop PMR????????
Kanan gill looks so much like Andy Samberg from Brooklyn Nine nine
But that&#39;s how power structures work in indian family where mom is stay-home. dad ultimately has to approve you of leaving home for a month because you still live with your parents and not earn your own money.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=243">4:03</a> the ultimate sangskari weapon in Bollywood, &quot;om jai jagdi shri hare.&quot;

That ‘kusbooo’ 🤣
Unibro
Overrated shittttt
Maybe if I  understood why they stopped making videos
When are you guys coming back!!?? 😭
Kanan ❤️
At the end, she is shown running in Indian wedding ethnic dress towards SRK who is already on a moving train. Isn&#39;t train picking up the speed? Or is Kajol running so fast that she catches up with the speed? All she could have done is jumped inside a compartment and then went to SRK within the train compartments. SRK could have also pulled the chain too.
i only  noticed  kanan .. He was wearing deathly hallows chain. And m like man i want that
To phir problem kya hai???
COME BACK PLIS
The best part of the video &quot;tere ko kon bola tha train me chadne&quot;.😂😂😂😂😂
&quot;She literally gives him her flower.&quot;<br>My mind straight went to F.R.I.E.N.D.S
😝😝😝
College mai fail ho gaya hai bara ukharnay aya hai lmaoooo
I wish they’d continue this. It was so funny
And resident Indians made a billionaire out of shahrukh khan..!!!
Nobody:<br>SRK: &quot;Meri ungliyon mein ajeeb sa jaadu hai&quot;
Bore kar dia.. Copy mat kia kro.. Khud ka original lao
That Google shirt dude looks like, less cool version of my friend Allan.
You are not only genius you are indigenous😅😅
I was thinking what&#39;s wrong DDLJ, you cudnt find many faults. Anyways good job, maybe you had a hard time doing this review😄
Why did you stop with movie reviews, plz resume.
1994 ka chutiyapa kaafi Lamba chal gya
College mein fail ho gaya bada ukhadne aa gaya.... breathless 😂😂😂😂
kanan has the deathly hallows symbol on in the last !!!
Just letting you guys know I&#39;m still watching these reviews now after discovering you guys in 2015. Still funny AF. I&#39;m not Indian but I am basically raised with Bollywood movies. Wish you guys would still do these videos. There are just soooo many films you could do, past and present. i.e: Race 3
Unibro... seriously guys!!
Dude wats wrong with unibrow...its absolutely beautiful n natural...she had guts to be like that man before so many years in Bollywood which is the headquarters of unrealistic beauty standards... rest all roasting is too good.
I totally lost it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=319">5:19</a>
The creepy comment was spot on!!😂😂😂
Miss them! 😔😪 So many movie reviews have sprouted but none can match the hilarity and sarcasm of these two 😘
That was epic...they should do all of that for other movies
the ending was epic...  awesome guys
Anyone here again after kusha&#39;s movie reviews
I have laughed soo much in the inevitable fight....&quot;college fail hogaya bada ukhad lega&quot; literally my stomach hurts i have laughed so much

I am sharing this on my facebook page only because i believe karan johar&#39;s movies has caused more problems than anurag kashyap. All the boys in my college were behaving like this.
Kanan why you so beautiful man❤️❤️❤️
Omg looking at this now, I feel Kanan looks a lot like an Indian version of Jake Peralta/Andy Samberg 🤣🤣
She gave him her flower -_-
Please start the pretentious movie reviews again

That unibrow was hilarious

Love the last fight😂

Meanwhile kuljeet also said that ek Baar shadi ho gyi to Simran ghr me HM bhr,to he was not cheated
Our culture is best but it is very wrong to downgrade others,they r best too,and if they r not,they r very hardworking
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsArppsJbZc">https://youtu.be/bsArppsJbZc</a> please review this !!!
Raj and Simran fight was epic and the unibrow killed me 😂😂😂😂
The fact you guys pointed out on NRIs is really true
There must be a season 2 for pretentious reviews
If you guys are liking this then I&#39;m sure you haven&#39;t watch youtube channel named - Only Desi<br>must watch his roast in movies
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0VZZELCFIE">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G0VZZELCFIE</a> Not sure which movie is this.. but would definitely like a review on this one..
Just here for &quot;KHUSHBOOOOO&quot; in amrish puri&#39;s voice 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Watched this so many times in the past and only just noticed Kanan wearing the Deathly Hallows chain in the end &lt;3
I miss these so much 😭😭❤
please review more movies
Harassing a women is not flirting, inspiring thousands of acid attacks is what this movie and SRK did. Moreover, women are so demeaned in this movie that she ends up with the guy who harassed her, bullied her, molested her. How they fall in love is that he says &#39;palat&#39;. A SHAMEFUL MOVIE.
Anupama chopras best...
Bring this back :&quot;c
😒 lame
Both of u boys r so cute
Their role play is more entertaining than all srk Kajol movies
I died at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=32">0:32</a>
Guys this is not something small . There geniuses of comedy
Women= wear scarfs either around the neck or over the head !? 🤣😂
Thank God they brought up the creepiness. I had to go through college, suffering this nonsense from multiple boys because their idea of romanace is Karan Johar movie. People don;t understand what  these kind of movies do.
<b>Clying with laughter emoji</b> INSERT HERE

“Mujhe Europe dekhna hai”<br>The real desi parent: <b>buys her a globe</b>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=545">9:05</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=624">10:24</a> 😂
On a PMR spree in 2145 rn

It&#39;s like Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne wants to escape 😂😂😂😂😂
Wish you guys made more videos like these.
kusboo 🤣🤣
Thank God I didn&#39;t watch this shit Isse jyada badi chutiya movie kabhi nhi Bani I guess race 3 bhi better hogi.... not that I watched that shit
Bhai maza nahi aaya. U did try your best but film acchi thi. Sorry
Best part starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=540">9:00</a>
Bring this back dude, that end was so incredibly relatable, LOL
These guys are just amazing.<br>I really like them ,the way they pottery the life after love marriage is just killing. It literally changes my perception about love and love marriage. And mostly importantly will never go for love marriage. Rather i will prefer to remain single but seems better then those problems which are logically expected to come after getting married the one whome i choose, using my intellect for choosing her, and that also in an age when it was hard for me to choose any subject in college while keeping my capabilities in mind .<br>So basically it&#39;s pretty sure that there are 95% of chances, that i always had to go for single column while filling any form to be submitted.
No matter how illogically the film is made ,if audience loves it ,then director has done a good job. As every movie is made keeping audiences in mind director do his or her work accordingly. So if an illogically scripted film is hit on box office then we may blame audience not the director or writer and not even hero.<br>It&#39;s people who should change their protective about watching films so that film makers also will try to change their vision while going for any project.<br>Maybe i am wrong. These are my personal views about making films and am sure it will give us to watch some good entertaining films without logic been distrotted much .
Review by Anupama Chopra <br>Seriously lol<br>Sab upar se gaya
&quot;Clying and crapping&quot; in the theatre 😂😂😂
Bollywood should take responsibility for all the wrong notion they spread about romance and women in India. Good job you both for addressing this.
How do you guys do it yaar?
Biswa can&#39;t control his laughter in the quarrel!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Last fight was awesome with that unibrow kanan too cute 😍😍😍😍
Got it. Kanan looks like Andy Samberg.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=546">9:06</a> And thus we found out that kannan is a terrible gf.
That preeti looks like tapsee pannu

This video is not genius. It&#39;s indigenous.
Wait London is in UK which is in Europe and they wanna see Europe... They don&#39;t even specify ki sirf Switzerland ghoomenge humto....  Aur masti karenge.....
The end skit is extra funny because you can literally see them trying to contain their laughter 😂😂😂

What was anupama chopra trying to say?. Xd
Who is here in 2019 press like
Too much recism in Bollywood movies

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=286">4:46</a> Guess who?
HAHAHA Why does Kanan Gill have a Death Hallows locket in the last outtake
Dude their chemistry is out of this world. I ship them :3
Please start this again .. please
The extraordinary love stories are the ordinary ones...
1. Ddlj was chosen because it’s catchy and there was nothing to hide about the ending. <br>2. Gud point/roast<br>3. Monobrow roasts r stupid. It’s like calling someone brown, the focus should’ve instead been that even though she has a monobrow the most good looking guy in the world fell for her. <br>4. NRI. Seriously. Can’t say anything about this because I doubt anyone took this point seriously. <br>5. The whole badtameezy part was gud point. But this movie isn’t saying badtameezy karo, it’s showing the journey of a avaara without a heart to a caring man with one. <br>6. It’s still the benchmark for romance movies. <br>7. All the people he mentioned except for bua weren’t sad. Daadi already saw her as a bride. Priti was smiling at the end coz she believes in true love. Kuljeet was a bad man with bad intentions, villain, so just like every single movie, the antagonist was unhappy.<br>7. The whole about future was stupid. The movie is about raj’s journey into becoming a man. <br><br><br>I’m not saying this coz I luv the movie but because it’s a disappointing and terrible roast. Literally all of this happens in most films even now. Except they hv more avaarapanti. More unnecessary violence and even more stupid transitions from hate to love. So rly the most Bollywood ever point is too stupid.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=500">8:20</a> Dead
indigenious
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=654">10:54</a>  :D
Okay, I&#39;ve to comment this... Am I the only one who noticed Deathly hallows (Harry Potter) on Kannan&#39;s neck? Is it really deathly Hallows or am I hallucinating?
Do review of Naksha movie ( sunny deol and vivek oberai)
&quot;meri ungliyo me kuch ajeeb sa jadu hai&quot; LOL Aur ye chutiya industry ka star hai.  I&#39;ve never seen DDLJ and don&#39;t intend on.
Anupama at the end 🤔
&quot;Tereko koan bola tha train me chadhne kliye&quot; laughed so hard 😆😆
I love the Pun at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=326">5:26</a> XD
Khushbu is my ex name actually,and I love the way you called her🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What about that line when Raj says &quot;main ek hindustani ladhki ki izzat........&quot; means baki Duniya ki ladhkiyon ki koi izzat nahi Hai😂😂😂😂😂

I love the way you guys improv shit 😂😂
EXERCISE!!!
If Yash Chopra had known that somebody like you would make a pretentious movie review one day, more than 20 years later, then he would&#39;ve never ever made the film ever.<br>Even Shahrukh Khan would not approve of the stunts he has shown doing in the movie.<br>He&#39;s like &quot;Bhad main jaye dulhan, main toh patli gali se kalti ho jaonga.&quot;
&quot;Tera face chadi dalega tho kaisa lagegea&quot;dats so biswa 😂😂😂😂😂
Just for the record- only NRI’s in movies complain. Most actual NRI’s shit on India. Sorry but ask literally any NRI

Whoelse watching in 2018
And at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=633">10:33</a>, Kanan uses the Deathly Hallows to prevent himself from dying after watching the movie..😆😆
I need more of these
khusboooo!!!!
Is that a deathly hallows chain on Kanan in the end?
I am an Indian girl living in Shanghai, China because I married a Chinese guy, but nostalgia really hits you hard when you leave the country. By the time you really start missing your country, it&#39;s too late to go back. But it is real. No matter how developed the other countries are, the mysticism and richness of Indian culture pulls you back like crazy. So much so that I started criticising China on Quora and became a most veiwed writer on the topic of China lol.
Every once in a while, I watch all these videos again, aur kuchh better karne ko hai hi nahi
main jaa rahi hun kuljit ke paas
😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥
Oh man the unibrow
O My God!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂      <br>I just can&#39;t stop laughing😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tom cruise romancing kajol 🤮🤮🤮
To fir problem kya hai? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=703">11:43</a>
Imagine if this movie was released in 2018
u should not have made fun of unibrow... its bad.. i&#39;m also
PMR 😂😂 So relatable and hilarious 😂😂 You guys are awesome 😎
Another review pleeeeeeeaseee!!
I am on a PMR marathon &amp; I wholeheartedly agree with everything but Kuljeet wasn’t a “nice guy”, he was an asshole.
The reason why ddlj was removed from maratha mandir
Omg!!! Awesomeeee!!!!
Abey...ye dictionary nai hai... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The inevitable fight kills me
Please do a pretentious movie review of Mard..

U got dislike as well in this video... Because of ddlj hehhehhe
<b>Meri ungliyo me kch ajeeb sa jaadu hai*... behncho</b> 😂😂😂😂 maar do hsake
shah rukh’s “ae ae ae” LMAO
My problem was like why Europe Europe? Name the country plus doesn&#39;t she already live in England?
Why it isn&#39;t &quot;pretentious movie reviews&quot; anymore? And just &quot;Kanan Gill&quot;?
omg that damn right at kajol chanting mantra😂😂😂
That NRI nostalgia point was spot on.. my cousins are in abroad but their behaviour are cringeworthy when they criticize abroad and behave like missing India. I m like: then come here, u were not extradited..
Hii, I think you guys should do a movie review on Koi Mil Gaya. I love your reviews and die laughing everytime !!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOZyX3bv2Hc&amp;t=588">9:48</a> Man, lost it then
