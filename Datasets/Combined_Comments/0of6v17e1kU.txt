This is from a movie for goodness sake!

wow! its really touching one. Loved to watch it more n more.
They could of least use a cheap camera to make it look more realistic 
Awwww cute
Awwww soooo cute dolphins are really smart
I just burst into tears
This is a movie...Zeus and Roxanne from 1997 lmao
Its fake, clearly cameras are everywhere - underwater, by pier/boat multiple camera angles definitely not a rookie filming a &quot;moment&quot;.
the dog could have died if it weren&#39;t for the dolphin
Yes it&#39;s real. Who could dislike this video 
Awwww that was really sweet 
amazing...gonna see the movie
Poor shark might starve to death.
God made every animal for a purpose and we need all animals as this creates a balance in life.
Was that real<br>
&quot;Zeus and RoxanneÂ &quot; Some one below said its the movie its from
Cool..Looks like movie though.&gt;so what movie?
I, m so happy the shark did not get the dog. Dolphins are realy sart
i slmost creed from the dog
So glad people aren&#39;t being fooled here...this is from a movie called Zeus and Roxanne (see comments below this) and all of these behaviors are trained ones. This is a captive dolphin, and I find it hypocritical of a movie with such a good message to use one in it. The story was based off a real event, but the one we see here is a reenactment and completely the opposite. Here we see humans exploiting a dolphin, not truly communicating with it as the movie asserts we need to do. Typical human hypocrisy and credulity. The reason this video doesn&#39;t show up on mobile devices is because of the copyright on the song you used, which is really distracting and takes away from the video.<br><br>The bottom line and the message the movie was trying to, but failed to assert by using a captive dolphin: Humans need to communicate and understand the feelings of each other and those around them.
people should stop hunting dolphins!!!
if all human are this kind there will be peace 
Dude it&#39;s from a movie so obviously it was set up. How is a dog going for a swim and riding on a dolphin animal cruelty? The dog looked fine to me.
ok that dolphin is smart even if it was a movie clip
Only in Disneyworld
It&#39;s badly sad for me,  cause I can&#39;t watch the videos!!! THE owner doesn&#39;t give them free for Mobile phones/tabs :((((
epic fail background music

Shouldn&#39;t this be called &quot;Dolphin trained to give dog a ride while filmed from various angles&quot; or something :)
This is a clip from the movie Zeus and Roxanne.
I want real that happens
