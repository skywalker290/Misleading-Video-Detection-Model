I like sara as agood girl
Sara was amezing  girl  khud pe hasna  badi baat hai
Saif is don lol
Muje sirf dom ki ladki kyun pasand ati hai
What a fun interview
The actual role model ❤
I love sara because she is beautiful, from cultured family, Frank and maintain her weight nicely also she respect all the Hindu rituals , religious but I hate her because she has obsession about Aryan (KT),pahariya ........... I think Sahid is more handsome than kartik...
I alsi like Sara. I hate the booby sisters.
Good
Posture perfect 💖
Poo as your stepmother. ...
Watching her twice for her answers
Clear with this ....let stack it down.<br>..other hot scenes up....clear it from there Google India...Pakistan operation closed...🌈😀

I like Sara Ali Khan for the person she is. She is fiercely independent, confident and so articulate with her thoughts. May she find lots of happiness and success in whatever she does.
When dream s incomplete,  that laughter s incomplete
Why fatwa is not issued against her. These Muslims will play whatever they want and blame Hindus.
Sara where is your hijab? Why your community is not trolling you for not wearing hijab? Why you are not supporting your community on hijab.
this is new generation, care free but not typical tom boy 😊
Bubbly sara💕
Crush

She is So Adorable and Beautiful❤❤❤
This shows saif Ali Khan treated her equally like he treats taimur..else divorced father usually doesn&#39;t even bother to ask how their kids are... not everyone is fortunate like her... many girls had a father who used to beat their moms so there is nothing much to flaunt here ...

By far the only set of interviews where every actor has unfiltered behaviour 👍👍
What did she say from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTNgH_5xYh0&amp;t=170">2:50</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTNgH_5xYh0&amp;t=180">3:00</a> ?
Dude, i seriously can&#39;t believe i loved her so much as a fan but now she only makes me remember how badly sushant was treated!! <br>You&#39;ve got everything money, family background in bollywood, drugs to get fit, still took life of such humble person<br>RIP sushant..❤️
I personally think she should do more n more interviews so we could just watch her
She is soo adorable 😍
Sara ❤️ i 🤍 sara
All lie,, no daughter will be happy if some other woman came to her dad&#39;s life while her mom is still alive... Why is she soo liar🤮🤮🤮🤮 I don&#39;t like her from very first time... Over acting
I just love sara... So gud and simplicity..
Anything expensive is bhada😂 omg she is real😎
She is so amazing person 💓💓💓with good heart

Okay, I will be frank. That laugh @4.59 scared the shit outta me. I was drinking water and almost spat it on my phone 😂

Koi tumsa nhi ho koi tumsa nhi
ahh She was dating and befooling Sushant .. very cunning girl ..doesnot deserve to be here .. boycott her
So cute.. superb attitude
Not a word about sushant<br>She had living in relationship with him then
Why Sara Ali Khan is speaking in fake English accent and the way she speaks looks like annoying to me
She is giving so positive attitude, and funny , lovely girl 😍
Sara is a drug addicted girl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br>For that reason I HATE YOU🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTNgH_5xYh0&amp;t=340">5:40</a> I agree with the presenter - stop calling yourself Chick.. even after he tells her she just doesn&#39;t get it. Thick as shit!
👎👎👎👎
sara ka
iska toh gala dabana chahiye
She kept saying that she doesn&#39;t have a filter omg what a fake girl sara is otherwise she should talk about drugs bcz she doesn&#39;t have a filter according to her... She is such a hypocrite i hate her now
Shameful youth icon!

girl crush😍😘
Sorry she has no dress sense. Do these kids really think more  beautiful have they not heard less flesh exposure is charming and not cheap looking.
Sara is so cute,innocent,beautiful also <br>She is also a starkid,she make her stardom with very hard work but she doesn&#39;t have attitude
You like so pretty sara and also you have such great inner beauty as well I just can&#39;t get enough haha I&#39;m not gay Or maybe I am I love you alot sara you&#39;re so sweet so cute omg 😊🥰😘😇☺❤❤
To be honest i dont like sara ! But i literally loved her in this interview 👏😌
Wow🤩🤩
Dude you&#39;re so real
Sara🥰🤩
My favourite
She&#39;s so Beautiful 🌹 ♥
I like her attitude, she is amazing
Never in my life i came across an actor that is so genuine and so down to earth. That makes  her THE best. Beautiful inside out..<br>Love from Pakistan❤
she is amazin
I also recommend you instead of wasting your time on the interviews, please save time focusing on the films and for other big things. You are so talented, just channelize your energy
This host is so irritating
Can’t stand that gay interviewer. And I can never accept her claim that she was “happy”. It is clearly untrue. It is an awkward topic and because they are celebrities it is so sad they have to tell the whole world about such things and pretend like it’s normal. At the end of it all, I like Sara Ali Khan a lot.
MANH I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH HER ❤️🧡💛
This guys is like your desi aunty who&#39;s cornered you at some family event and is pestering you about every little personal detail. Sara handled herself really well which was his saving grace but I was getting annoyed listening to him.
Sara look so nice
She is indeed amazing adorable funny.. Just love her.. 😘😘😘
Lol
She is better in interview rather than movie.
Amrita is more pretty
Her jaw line is so awesome love her laugh👍
She has no comparison with other actresses she is so down of earth and most importantly she is my favouritee😘😘😘😘
<b>Wittiest young actress of BW</b><br>I just love her Mann♥️😍
Lots of love for Sara..I daily watch her interviews
She&#39;s very cool
it was poo
the way she laughs.....just tells how grounded she is....🙂🤗😇
This is so inappropriate to repetitively ask her about her parents separation, that how she felt, how she cope up with it, I mean this is sara Ali khan whose so brave and strong, what if she wasn&#39;t a person who was comfortable to talk about this, and who knows if she deep down isn&#39;t okay to say this again and again. There is personal life and a professional life, stop forcing people to combine both. Someone&#39;s separation is truly their personal matter.
so beautiful sara I like to so much
She&#39;s amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love you Sara 😍😍 you  are sweetheart
Anything expensive is &quot;Bhada&quot; I died😂😂
She reminds me of Manisha koirala and Rose of Blackpink.
she is beauty with brain
This girl is amazing to the core.
I&#39;m ur hugeee fannnnnn
😂😂😂..she is awesome ya😂
Babar Azam wants marry her
When ananya says u public are bullying and i know how to deal with u all <br>U all re judging me under nepotism<br>Then why would we accept alia and sara etc we do accept only talented one but not the one who acts like u like lifelessactingg
Sara , you are the overattitude , jealous , overwhelming actress same  Ananya pandey acting toh nhi aati . I hate . You much get obsessive shameless actress 😡😡

If this is nepotism I love it to the core 😂♥️
Nice dress 😍
its so hard for a person not to love her she is soo lovable❤

Sara is soo beautiful and talented girl with her own originality she is amazing 😍
I just love her
Sara will become a very successful actress in Bollywood <br>Mark these words 😘😘
Love from Bangladesh for Sara for her zero attitude being a born star and best of luck.
This is the first time I saw interviewer was enjoying talking interview😁😁 The interview was so interesting ☺☺
She&#39;s very happy and cute 😂😂😅😅😁 down to earth and happy going girl 😀😁😂😂😂
Sara is really cute &amp; cool

Happiness is watching sara ali khan&#39;s interviews
i love your voice Sara and the way you laugh....waiting for your next movie
Smilling like stupid because sara laugh 😂
Sara shud b idol for young girls then trippy kardashians. Sara is matured , lovely ,down to earth n funny lil desi but thinks modern.
Everytime I see her I get more positive about life...there is other side of life too and we don&#39;t see it<br>And if you accept that side...life can go easy
Her code of conduct is really amazing👌
She know how to handle media ..
Sara is so positive person cool...
Anushka sharma copy

She is soooooo natural 💋❤️
She is amazing,soo down to earth, full of fun and at the same time very very intelligent! 💜
Sara is soo nice than janvi
Omg she is cute girl
she is with Zero attitude:-) love from Uk
The interviewer is a classless fellow and highly irritating.<br>Sasta Karan Johar.
nobody is single
amar nijere dekhte shob cheye beshi bhalo lage
Such a amazing human being.... She is....
Sara&#39;s mother Amrita Singh is Hindu <br>but Saif Ali Khan is <a href="http://muslim.so/">Muslim.So</a><br> I want to know Sara is actually a Hindu or Muslim?<br>But Whatever it is.Sara I Love you 😘❤️ a lot you are so beautiful naturally.<br>You have a very cutenesses naturally and you are not like other young actresses.💙
The golden girl Sara Ali Khan
I love her attitude😊
Hyeeeee..... The way she laughs on the trolls❤
FLOP nepotism product
Just a middle class boy fan of Sara Ali khan 😍
Very beautiful sara g
You are star
😘
Sara aap bahut positive hai or aapka face aisa hai ki koyi morning dekhe to uska pura din ban jaye jindgi kese Ji jati hai wo aapse koyi sikhe
She is pretty😘😘😘
My useless talent - - - - - i can be calm crying laughing all my life
The interviewer&#39;s voice sucks👎👎
She always steals my heart!
Oh God how great and funny are they
She can handle everyone
She is awesome
I love her thought.
Sara u have better facial expressions than other actress in bollywood 😀☺️☺️
Aina remake with her will be awesome
She&#39;s quite wise for her age &amp; has an magnetic personality !! Seeing her first time in an interview. I liked the way she handled/responded the divorce question of her parents.
He was constantly telling to lower her morale
She is so genuine even in her answers
loll.. she is so repulsive
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTNgH_5xYh0&amp;t=348">5:48</a> witty words
Sara is a great combo of Saif and Amrita. In looks and in eloquence
queen sara😍😍
the way she laughed on her trolls lol 😝 loved it
Disgusting voice sara
Sara is such a great person and so much adorable that even kareena cant be ...
Varun Mitra &amp; Sara Ali Khan ❤
Soo FAKE! Undeserving!
I used to love Ayesha Takia so much, but I was so upset when I lost her cute personality due to lip plumping surgery, Sara Ali khan is my next favorite. — I’m a female.
The only star kid I like
Karthik no offense man,but u are a fool to let dz gal go
Dude who are the ones to dislike, man? I kept watching the entire interview intentionally looking for something that&#39;d make me wanna dislike it but NO ! NOTHING! She&#39;s too flawless in the way she speaks..will give it to her!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTNgH_5xYh0&amp;t=299">4:59</a> her laugh .. So cute
Please be a little kind towards interviewing younger actresses. They are naive and asking such bitchy questions (which we are aware is your job but can be handled decently) while sternly fixating on words like separation of parents, etc. seems inconsiderate!
Funny comedy
Cool 8&amp; intelligent
Why are you wearing so, sexy clothes. You look better in fully covered cloth but your sexy shorts is extreme.
So, sexy shorts
She is sooo cute 😍😍😍😍😘😘😘
Sara 💞💟💕
Finally koi to actress h jise dekh k smile ATI h face p😍😍😍😍😍love u sara

Flop actress and actress
Her humour and smartness is the quality we love her the most! 🤣💕
She’s so freaking down to earth and really outgoing very respectful ❤️❤️
What is so funny that even the laughing sounds fake.
Sara is really bindass.
Such an irritating sounding interviewer. He&#39;s telling her she&#39;s bullshitting him. 😁🙆
Atleast she is natural not some plastic girl ☺
She&#39;s angel ❣️

New age Preity Zinta! Cute,bubbly,well-spoken and very real.

That laughter and nothing hiding... She&#39;s incarnation of kajol... Both r genuine
Fluent conversation.... Awesome sara...thats wat i love about her
Sara u r da best
She never uses fake accent. Whether she is speaking English or Hindi. I don&#39;t know for how many things I am going to love her for. The only expensive thing she own is her bhadda.... Omg this girl is on another level. South Delhi girls have more attitude and show off then this Hen😂
The interviewer is so investigative. Such interviews should be conducted with the politicians so that they are coaxed into revealing a lot.
Dont ask any child about their parents divorce 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡disgusting
not possible to be so cute😘😘😘😘
Carbon copy of her mom ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Shirt theek sy pehenti..tanghi ho rahi daikh kar
You should change the host NOW
Thank u filmfare official for bringing SARA ALI KHAN😍😍🔥 here . ...she is really a QUEEN❤️❤️
I get remainded of rachel green from friends!
She is very real and honest of herself
She is so sweeetttt
Its fun listening to Sara. She is so intelligent, so articulate, so down to growth
Ooo my favourite sara she not attitude queen
She is a very humble person...I hope she achieves great success in her life
How agree with me that Sara is very beautiful and cute also she has very nice voice. Hit a like here Sara&#39;s fans
Love Sara, she has such a jolly bubbly high spirited personality
Show some love. Please?
Very good points about marriage.
Whose name starts with A and ends with A 🤣
I&#39;m from kerala and I haven&#39;t seen any of her movies so far, but since the day I saw her interview for 1st time...I&#39;m a huge fan of this girl. Not just in Bollywood, I must say there&#39;s no genuine person like her in Indian film industry. <br>Her perspective on everything reveals that she is educated unlike any other actors and she is well raised.<br>Sara💙
So intelligent her voice killing..  And her answer about her shopping yam
&quot;it&#39;s a Sara Sara things&quot; 😍😍😍😍😍
Sara- beauty with brain 😍❤️
She is truly HUMOROUS and BEAUTIFUL
The laugh at  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTNgH_5xYh0&amp;t=301">5:01</a> seems fake
Wow shes bindass
She needs to improve her dressing
Every star kid seems to be fake.....except for Sara she is so good🤩🤩🤩🤩
what&#39;s with this interviewer....everything is wrong about him...everything
nepotism has brought down the beauty-quotient of bollywood. there are no pretty faces any more
She is soo adorable ❤
She is the best actor....innocent, adorable, no attitude, lovely, beautiful
GRACE...!!
Why does every talk show host need to behave like Karan Johar like there r even other options around the globe ....including their own personality
She is inspiring to other actresses......<br>Her simplicity..
She is inspiring to other actresses......<br>Her simplicity..
I love how smartly she answers all the questions<br>BEAUTY WITH BRAIN.
India needs more actresses like Sara Ali Khan who is extremely smart and well educated. She is leagues and miles ahead of these stupid 12th class pass actresses like Deepika Padukone or that useless Katrina Kaif (who never even went to school).
No attitude!!! She is so perfect!! I bet she has many fans like me &lt;3
Future of the Bollywood,  new khan girl on the rise !
How can anyone not like her.
Ye jitesh pillay he?  Mene phli br dekha after chandivali studio 😒😒😒😒😒i love u hina

Filmfare Best debut female. Well deserved Sara.
She’s the wittest actress in Bollywood.
There is an undeniable energy and attraction to Sara ‘s personality that makes her like    Her so much.

She&#39;s completely amazing
Zara si bhi ghamand nahi hai inme. Yahi baat hai Jo Sara ko unique banati hai.

For you divorce of your parents are fine but for me it was pain because my father did not give any money even though he was banker because he found my mother not interesting as she was educated so she was not much social compared to hot girls
She is so intelligent

Stop asking these questions to anyone Rajiv....about their parents divorce that&#39;s not good...u ppl should think once. Somewhere ppl will get sad but they have to manage in front of cam.
Hello dear, your useless quality is what India likes💖💖
Born star!!! ❤
Cheap hand# cheap chick# only Sara Ali Khan🤣🤣🤣adore u darling # super star# super talented# very well bought up.. 👌
“It’s a very one on one thing, it’s a Sara Sara thing” um why is that so me. 😂😂

She is so kind no show off down to earth.....she is frst celebrity whom  I follow most...... Love her beauty queen love from Pakistan<br>We want peace
SARA.ASMA😀⭐<br>.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTNgH_5xYh0&amp;t=334">5:34</a> should really happen
Ap jaisi ho waise hi rehna... Celebrity ki tarhan react nai krna...
a very few interviews make me happy  but sara stole my heart❤
Last ko call me was for Kartik. Well now he has on KWK
It doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s your step mother/mother........but if you are someone who&#39;s never disrespecting other ppl&#39;s parents you deserve it to be treated as a HUMAN..............if you disrespect you are not a good person...not even a HUMAN. It means you use your beast mode everywhere and you are a sick drunk person...so respect is everything. How she respects her stepmother tell how she could respect other ppl. Okay! Ppl can be good no matter which profession they follow, what matters is how that person is!
Wtf is that dressing 😂🤣😂🤣
She doesn’t deserve it nepotism product
Sara is so fun loving and positive...oh my God I just love her style..
Sara is like the Kajol of current generation.
She is so cute
❤❤sara Ali khan❤❤
She is just so genuine.omg its just hard not to totally love her.
Be lyk ds only..... love ur attitude ur nature
I guess  the last question answer is for kartik aryan😌😌
Sara dude, I love you, nawab ko ladki aur itni girl next door wali batein. ❣️
I love this show ❤💜💛💚💙
WHO FEELS SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HER BEAUTIFUL MOM?
OBSESSED

I really like her!!!!
Sara is so cute. Love her tooooo much
Karthik doesnt deserve sara
She is the bright future of Bollywood... I really enjoy watching her acting in skills and giving interviews in any platform
She is talking about Ananya pandey..  Lol 😂😂😂😂
Funny that she is this big fan of Poo but I can also imagine her as Anjali from K3G saying, &quot;Kaun Ashfaq Mia&quot; and rolling on the floor laughing.
she is behaving so much natural n.... not in attitude like celebrity
Sara you&#39;re so sweet and beautiful.
Such a nice person she is
She is the best actress 😍😍😍
I never watched any Bollywood celebs interview as much as I watch Sara&#39;s interview. Is she even real?😍 So Beautiful a person she is❤. P.S: Kartik Aryan is so way out of her league. I hope someone put this sense in her head.
She is the one♥️
My favourite ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mtlb kareena kay lie bhi koi negativity nhi hai Kia larki hai ❤️❤️
She is the most intelligent and cunning...<br>But I love her
I love u sara
Can I adopt u as my elder sister?
This is what a good upbringing results in <br>Just love the how she honestly and proudly accepts being a commoner like us ! 😊
She is a perfect example of a kind which proves beauty always should be viewed through brains not through fake cosmetics.
I love her attitude. She is so bindass. Speaks her mind. Way to go girl. Wishing to see much more frm u
she said call me indirectly to kartik and kartik called her in kofee with karan lol..
WTF she said mannnn.... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTNgH_5xYh0&amp;t=330">5:30</a>
Where can i get d full conversation??
She is my heart beat i wish i knew ur arrival in my country i love u
I am in Love
Ohkk so.. Sara says she wants to date Kartik on KWK.. and then here she says Call me..<br>And Kartik said on KWK that the easiest way to impress him is to say good things about him on KWK.. and then at the end of his show calls Sara!!!! I am sensing this thing going in a certain direction! ;)
Sara Ali Khan is looking lovely, beautiful, gorgeous and has a very very beautiful &amp; sweet gesture and smile and congratulations for the success of your film simba and all the best for your upcoming films and for your future
Yeah sara and kartik both are perfect as they laugh very hilarious and irritating😆

sara is lobe
these interviews are stupid and turn our favorite stars into hollow self centered and lonely people..Please stop asking star children about their parents&#39; separation.That  is a very uncomfortable and stupid question. Stupid people.
I bet, no one has got that 1.2 million views on this film fare Interview in just one week but Sara Ali khan got it.
uh. she is nice ya. her pr is great but this is nepotism at work because they have money for promotions!! remember how rajkumar and patralekha said that they had no offers even after their excellent performance  in city lights
love the way she takes trolls...so humerously
She reacted maturely on trolling comments. She such a sweetheart😍😍😍😍
Who is smiling while watching this video 😍
Cheap hen 😂

Is there a part 2?
She is so adorable..😘the actress who hv 0 haters...love uh sara💞😍😘
interviewers always ask her about parents divorce. i dont even understand what&#39;s the point? though she answers these qstns in a positive way but its still not fair to ask her qstns like that.
I watched more then 5 times because I want it to be more than 1 million view
Last &quot;call me&quot; was for karthik aryan
Why they are shameful to use hindi vocal...??? Bloody hypocrisy of indian cinema.... If Middle class of India stops to go theatre... There so called stardom will ruin in few days...
Lots of love from Nepal 💕Sara is love 😍
Why the Fuck does he enunciate so much
That “call me” was for kartik aaryan 😂😂

I just can&#39;t get enough of her and her interviews 😍

After Deepika Padukone Mam she is only my favorite. She is also so down to earth, so respecting, so we&#39;ll behaved. Even being a daughter of Pataudi&#39;s she don&#39;t have any attitude, no tantrums. She is a beautiful soul inner &amp; out❤. May God Bless her 🙏. And she is not beautiful, she is damn pure natural beauty i.e. damn gorgeous 😍😍
