If not fren. Why fren shaped?
Man, nature is crazy
That&#39;s a quality bear suit.
Vegetta le gana 😊
He&#39;s just sitting there wishing he hadn&#39;t eaten his best buddy Paddington. He tried to stop after he ate the honey 🍯 Not a chance.
Saying catch a fish for me
I don’t know what that bear is going through but I feel for him
Медведь понял,что ему тут не рады!!!
Kids don&#39;t try this at home 🐻
He/she is  beautiful 🐻
Wow! Bless it, I truly feel like it maybe had been watching you? And picked up on your energy.. this looks like a good place to sit and just take a rest.. but of course you can never be too careful.. what a fantastic moment!
He&#39;s just relaxing, taking in the beauty of the scenery. Amazing.
Didn&#39;t realize how many of them there were 😭
So I&#39;m just gonna hung out here with my human
Bear: &quot;Even the human can&#39;t give me tips on how to outwit my neighbors in fishing....&quot;
Why is he bullying that bear?
He’s like hey you got the coffee on?
&#39;So, hows life?&#39;<br>   -Bear
даа михалыч тут без 100 грамм не обойтись
Bear: &quot;I never know what to say in these moments.&quot;<br>Guy: &quot;What moments?&quot;<br>Bear: &quot;The ones before I kill somebody.&quot;<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJKUpQwnORk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJKUpQwnORk&amp;ab_channel=ElloEllo12314</a>
Bro resorting to the &quot;Cameraman Never Dies&quot; tactic!
&#39;&#39;Nice view isn&#39;t it?&#39;&#39; Bear watches it quietly<br>&#39;&#39;You know what would make it better?&#39;&#39; Bear sits casually<br>&#39;&#39;The juicy sandwich in your bag!&#39;&#39; Bear gives him the side eye..
Bear was probably gassed out from catching &amp; eating salmon.
And the bear like this: I wonder what this guy stares at all day long....
The bear is smiling!
The man to sit there next to a grizzly bear (one of the strongest bear species) he’s brave

bro wtf
“Rough day?”<br><br>“You don’t know the half of it.”
He&#39;s so sweet but I would be petrified.
I hope you brought spare underwear 💩
dont show this to joe rogan
❤
Ps,the ONLY Reason he wasn&#39;t eaten!!..he wasnt a SCIENTOLOGIST.......
those fluffy ears
An older bear told him to do it
Какой красавец : сел посидел как собака и пошел
Individual brown bears can have very different personalities. Some are easy-going, and some are real dicks.
All lot of people don’t realize that there was a Remington Marine Magnum 12 gauge sitting on the ground right next to the first chair. Totally useless and out of reach should the bear have decided to attack. It’s a good thing for the camera man he didn’t. That being said it was a very cute friendly bear that seemed content just stopping by to say hello then leave.
The bear is waiting for the fish from guy.
WTF there&#39;s an army of them
The bear is sat there like   It seems your gun is closer to me hunter.
Gençler sigara?
fake and gay
At least he wasn&#39;t a cocaine bear
Hey,they didn&#39;t show the guy who was dumping in his pants,was he up a tree?lol wow amazing&amp;beautiful,nature at its finest.that bear was chillin,but is a fish was caught,oh wow.justna really nice bear,but food involved would be different.but that&#39;s a encounter of a life,or death.that bear was beautiful.🐾
Hey George <br>Hey Dave<br>How was the weekend?<br>Same old same old<br>Yup…<br>Yup….
That right arm/leg is huge,,,
All the birds flying like this nigga crazy chillig i the hood😂😂😂
I would not be so quick to set up a lawn chair next to 15 bears in a river
Wow. Camera man got a serious death wish
This is really uncomfortable
I thought the bear would seat on the chair.
that&#39;s a grizzly . that my friend could turn u to mincemeat
&quot;Mr. Ranger won&#39;t find me here&quot;.
Definitely expected him to pop a squat on the chair
That was an unbelievable and rare occurrence.
Bro sat next to the deadliest mammal in the world. Respect.
“sup”
wow......wasnt hungry
When the bear leaves, it thinks: &quot;Hey, I thought that that guy had blue pants, now they are brown.... Strange.&quot;

👇People watching this is 2024
Where is this?
Inside the bear&#39;s mind: <b>Act normal</b> *Act normal*😂
Where&#39;s The Guy At, Did He Eat Him???
lol hes hittin the &quot;yeah bro, i like this spot too&quot;
He knew the cameraman never dies
Who is going to tell him he can’t
All fun until 😢
The bear was trying to make friends with a wild animal
The bear is probably wondering if he&#39;s got any fish he could steal as an easy meal
I am so stupid. I saw only bear and was seasching for the man but then I realised the man is obviously  the cameraman.
Thought hed sit in the chair...
bear just stole someones lunch and is now trying to not act guilty by chilling next to human showing hes one of the good ones
That &quot;hey hey hey hey...&quot; stuff turned the tide for him.  Scared the 1000 lb grizzly away like a little school girl.
Waiting for a fish snack
Bear: <b>sighs</b><br>&quot;I miss my wife, Tails...&quot;
why does the bear look like a guy in a suit or teddy bear
So romantic...
This is even better when you know that bears actually have the ability to appreciate a good view.
<b>Guts theme plays</b>
a youtube classic and still humbling
Noticed the shutgun on the floor just out of reach. I bet that whomever is taking the video is cursing himself. At one moment the bear actually looks at the gun. 😂
You lucky he jus ate, this is pretty cool tho.
At this point. I would be violently shitting my pants.
if its and grizzly bear lay down, if is an black bear fight back. if its an polar bear say good night
Nothing ruins a photoshoot like crapping your pants.
Freddy Fazbear Caught in real life 4K HD 60 FPS with DOLBY ATMOS powered by NVIDIA GeFORCE 4060 ULTRA SMOOTH GAMEPLAY.
Nice Video!
Bear picked dare
That bear is a human in a past life. And vice versa.
The bear survived another day
Hes like &quot;enjoy ur last moments buddy, ill be back to eat u&quot;
only in russia
&quot;Heyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyey&quot; 🗣️🤌🏿🔥
That’s terrifying
I bet that marine 870 felt VERY far away for that minute in time.
The bear was like:<br>“Hey man like the view? <br><br>Me too <br><br>Isn’t it beautiful makes you thing about the fishes in life<br><br><b>Sighs</b><br><br>Life is hard bro <br><br>Nice to see you <br><br>Gotta go bye”
Hell yeah
Sometimes bears need that 🐻
Bear: &quot;Catch anything?&quot; Human:&quot;😅&quot;
That’s smoky the bears just make sure that only you can prevent forest fire
Well come on you could see that he was tiered.   wats a bear to do or anyone for that matter.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Boo ....!
BRO LITERALLY VIBING
Phil! Phil come back! Is it something I said?????
Have u guys ever been to Red Lobster? Where u walk in and see the lobsters u can have for dinner? Same scenario here. Only the cameraman was the lobster. 🤣😂😅
He was just checking to see if the guy was gonna give him Salmon.
It was actually after your wallet. Needed some quick cash for that bus journey home
This isn&#39;t normal. Did he need help or did he interact with a human in the past? like a fisherman consistently visiting that area and leaving a pile of guts for the wildlife? So the bear was &quot;trained&quot;? Just some theories 🤔
“I hear the fish is pretty good here”
AI Bear?
Don’t worry, that’s just Smokey (he’s on break)
&quot;can u share bruh?&quot;
“Wsg brother 🍷🗿”
I feel sorry for the guy in the back
The true power of being the camera man
I like to think if the bear could talk, he&#39;d say something along the lines of &quot;You smell that Salmon, Ape?&quot;
It wasn&#39;t that guy&#39;s day to die....
He was threatening as hell, but he let him go.
This bear reminds me of my profile picture
Um, guys? Is that Freddy Fazbear?
I can just imagine a butterfly flying over its head as it tries to catch it
You should have given that bear a bearhug 🐻
Dont get fooled, if you want to see alternative reality go search for encounters that end up with bears tearing flesh and bones from human while he is still alive with that same smile and seemingly calm expression on bears face. Just a tip, you wont find it on YT.
Could have at least offered him some honey or salmon like come on....
If I was in this situation I would be unable to resist the urge to pet the bear and lose a hand or head
&quot;Yo got some Beers?&quot;
These type of people love putting themselves in situations and when they become an attack victim they wonder why.
Bear: Hod, can I kill this guy today?<br>God: No, you can&#39;t break the cameraman never dies rule, try next time when he isn&#39;t recording
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤bear❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤bear❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Men will see this and say &quot;hell yeah&quot;
Mama bear!
What do you wanna bet that the bear was on its way to go pick up some fish but didnt expect to see a human there, so didnt really know how to react
Photography is one wicked job.
Audio
Bro went from 1 bear, to 20 bears. Camera man fears no evil.
This bear is tops blooby
Never underestimate the power of a camera man 😂
“Hey bro. We gotta talk. Y’know how to deal with break ups?”
Is this seat taken?
“Uhm guys? Is this Freddy fazbear?? Har har har har har”
ok, i dunno what that was all about but that was weird... he&#39;s a &#39;bear whisperer&#39; or something??😮😮😳😳
I was not expecting an entire damn pack of bears in the last 2 seconds, holy fuck. The balls on this guy.
Guy: AY AY AY A AY<br>Bear: Oh no its a Canadian, have a nice day!
My comment will likely get a lot of negative posts, but I think this may not be a friendly or funny situation; quite the opposite. It does raise a number of questions for me, though:<br><br>1) The bear is panting and there is a film/foam on its mouth and its frequently licking its mouth/lips, which begs the question: what’s the temperature, i.e. hot enough to explain the bear’s panting? If hot and/or thirsty, why doesn’t the bear go to the river to cool off and get a drink? Answer: Not hot as the human is wearing an insulted jacket. Normally if animals are hot they will make an effort to get cooler, i.e. move to shade, lie on the ground to dissipate heat, etc. If, as suggested by others, the bear is full of fish, then it was in the cooling and thirst-quenching waters and should not be hot or licking its mouth/lips. 2) The bear’s stomach is distended, possibly full BUT its contents are UNKNOWN. May be fish, may be something else. 3) It’s not unusual for wild animals to approach humans in an effort to get help; you can look through YouTube at hundreds maybe thousands to verify that. 4) Since we generally don’t speak ‘Bear’ and bears don’t speak our language, to decipher animal communication we rely on body language and sometimes verbalizations. From the bear’s movements it seems to be uncomfortable, i.e. it stands with legs locked, its head is drooping, it’s not in an alert position. It looks as if its hind legs give out and it ‘sits’ or actually collapses. As it briefly sits, front legs still locked, it appears to be watching something in the river, its ears are up, listening and its head is no longer drooping.. Then it slowly turns its head toward the human/camera as it gets up and ‘walks’ away. I think ‘stumbles away’ is more accurate. As the camera follows it, its hind leg gives out and it appears to collapse but the camera suddenly moves away from the bear to the group of bears in the river. Why suddenly move the camera away from a bear that has intentionally approached a spot that is obviously frequented by humans (wood walkway, cleared vegetation, chairs)?? I suggest it originally sought help but smelled the intent of the humans and eventually left to collapse and die. Supporting evidence of this is the abrupt end of the film as if the author didn’t want to post the death of an animal. I’m not disparaging the person filming. It could be their unspoken comment stands as a confirmation that there are other bears, this isn’t the last of a species. Showing the group of bears in the distance also suggests that  was what the bear was looking at as it sat briefly before getting up. Without seeing more of the bear’s exit path, I can also imagine that the bear was deciding whether to join the group in the river or not; when it got up, I choose to believe it decided to go to the river group. Whether to have its last meal with its own kind or go for dessert, I don’t know. <br><br>At any rate, my main observation and request is that people take the time to observe wild animals and IF an animal is in distress, please make an effort to help, don’t ignore it. I’m not saying run headlong into a potentially dangerous situation but to trust YOUR INSTINCTS; recognize that we are connected to animals, they are sentient beings, i.e. they have brains and express emotions. We can learn a LOT from animals if we take the time to stop, listen and observe and relate. 🐻🌱
Looks to have as much personality as a great white shark
Nice
The bear probably said, &quot;Well, there&#39;s only one way this is going to end. Feel free to use this time to make your peace with God. I&#39;m in no hurry&quot;
Beautiful once you get over the heart stopping terror
Me trying to approach a woman
Don’t mind me! I’m just checking the fridge for something to eat 😊
I was told that female bears will stay near humans because they know it’s safer than being next to other much larger male bears. And that a bear sitting down means it isn’t looking to fight. What a cool thing to experience.
Typical fishing in Russia
Very old bear
Come here boy! Whos a good boy! Sit for a treat!
Babe! Did you bring the diapers??
Back to the truck, change pants.
This is fake
i have no enemies
bears have been recorded to visit and lay in scenic areas bc they are pretty to them (:
He sure don&#39;t want to mess with the camera man
&quot;Can I pet dat dawg?!&quot;
Me and the bear would be chilling
Was anyone else just waiting for the bear to get a wif of the human next to him?
This guy out here trying to be the next Timothy Treadwell
Catch me a fish bruh,,,,
Lot of grizzlies in that river
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I recognise him from other films, I&#39;m sure. Notorious tough guy, but seemed shy today 😅😉
Damn good thing it wasn&#39;t hungry and a mother w cubs nearby
I bet &#39;The guy&#39; had to change his trousres after that little encounter.
``what a day huh? ``
This skinwalker got the wrong costume equipped
Bear with bad hangover sits next to guy, hoping for a couple of aspirin. - Guy smells bad - and changes underwear multiple times. - Bear ponders whether to head home to wife and kids, or head back to bar in time for opening. - Bear returns to bar on borrowed unicycle. - Life&#39;s like that sometimes..........
pookie bear
Bear just wanted a beer &amp; acted naturally.
&quot;I&#39;ll just yawn &amp; act bored, like I do this all the time.&quot;
The cheat code for red dead redemption 2 is eh eh eh eh eh all the bears will leave you alone lol😂
He only wanted a fish or two 😇
I can’t imagine being this guy sitting next to a bear. I can’t 💀
This is proof I would never survive in nature because my brain would absolutely go &#39;puppy!&#39; and try to pet the bear and then promptly get mauled
He doesn&#39;t care about the humans.  He wants more fish, but he has to consider the bear political scene first.
I hope i can experience a wild animal sitting down next to me watching the wilderness with me
Bear: &#39;What&#39;s up, dude? How&#39;s the fishing here? Me, just had my share of fish. So, what are you doing?  Not talking, eh? Ok. Mind if I sit down? My feet hurt. Peaceful here, ya know?  Kinda boring, actually.  Ok, well time to go. Have a good one.&quot;
Bros recording for legal purposes
Ok so this video cute but terrifying because the camera man is lucky he made it out alive because that is a grizzly
Knowing myself, I would have gently talked to him.  Then, if that was accepted, later I would have tentatively held out my hand…..palm DOWN……to him.  Just like you would to a strange dog.  But, I would have let the bear lead the way for me to know what was accepted.
Big doggie
Whose a good bear!
The safest place you can run across a Bear is by a river or stream
you&#39;re a f* idiot. That bear could take your head off with one swipe of its paw. You&#39;re lucky to be alive and the one person who doesn&#39;t know it : is you.
Joke all you want to, but this could’ve turned sideways real quick
Obviously it wasn&#39;t hungry.
Bad day to leave the shotgun at the OTHER chair
Lmao he made me 🥱🤣😂😴
bear is like sup dude what you doing?
I thought he would sit down in the other chair
Has the camera man been seen again?
“Guy sits next to bears dinner table”
Oi ist dis Freddy faz bear?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=70">1:10</a> he was going for the guy but then smelled the poopy pants and lost his appetite
Canadian Bear: “Heya, neighbor! Sooo what’s on dat menu fer today? Oh, just enjoying da view, eh? It’s a beaut!”
Hey human….anything bitting today? Kinda feelin some salmon myself….
“Weather is beautiful today, huh?”
Classic found footage video.
That bear is chill AF.
hes just a dang ole bar 🐻
When you look at a bear, you think &quot;he&#39;s so big, he must be slow and sluggish&quot;. But bears are <b>extremely</b> swift and quite agile. Considering their size - yeah, nobody really stands a chance
&quot;Hey dude, see that guy? Its a human, the predator of predators, I dare you to go sit next to him&quot;
I think the voice over for this would be, &quot;Hey bra, got any rolling papa?&quot; They guy is like, &quot;No sorry brudda.&quot; Bear walks off. Guy is like, &quot;Yo, back off my shit.&quot; Bear like, &quot;Chill, bra, nowhere near yo shit. Calm down.&quot;
How bear you !!
Certified bear classic
Bear is like, there&#39;s no hard feelings i just get hungry sometimes.
That is a cute looking bear ☺️🫶🏻 <br>🐻: may I have a cup of coffee?
You know What they say, the camera man never dies
Bears also enjoy the scenery like us, if not more.
Shotgun was sitting between him and the bear, just out of reach.  He was lucky the bear was not hungry.
Bear: You’re kinda in my regular seat, but OK.  Got any snacks?
you can tell it&#39;s a dude in a fur suit
The bear was looking for some stimulating conversation.
Anyone hear the screams? Haha.
I was so amazed after I see a shit ton of them on the river lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=63">1:03</a> bro flicked his head like wsp lol
Probably counting coo<br>Got another one
Damn, I only brought one pair of pants.
bears always look like costumes
Looks like guy didn&#39;t expect that
You come here fishing too? xD
UMMM<br>YUMMMY<br>EASY<br>LUNCH.
Whats up buddy
What a beauty. I’m surprised they’re so calm, both of them actually. But this doesn’t seem like it will mess with the bear’s views on humans, which is good.<br><br>Edit: Ahhhh he’s a photographer, he knows what he’s doing then.
Bro&#39;s Just Chilling
I think he`s looking for your picanic basket
Nice and peaceful! )
<b>I HAVE NO ENEMIES</b>
I&#39;VE NEVER HAD A CAT THAT BIG!!<br><br>HE MAKES MY MAINE COONS, LOOK LITTLE!!
most candian thing i have every seen
Bear was definitely full from eating salmon
Amazing
Isn’t that a grizzly? I heard they kill for fun so I’m surprised he survived.
The bear was like “you chose a peaceful spot to die I’ll give you a moment”
He talking about some ay ay ay fool you’re in this bear’s living room big boy you better watch your ass he doing what he’s supposed to do
Bear
Thinking it&#39;s just a lone bear......camera pans....a billion bears.
Bear sits next to guy<br>Guy s*its next to bear

Bear is lucky, you see the human getting aggressive as he comes close. Who knows what would have happened
bro is calculating his calories and found it to be surplus 😮
,,Bear&#39;&#39;, thought human.<br>,,Human&#39;&#39;, thought bear.
Thats my stress bear, his name is cheeseburger. He is pretty chill. He also sadly has diabetes, but he’s fine.
That bear looks very old, wise, and experienced. It’s obviously led a very long life.
Holy shit your lucky it wasnt hungry
thats a funny lookin dog
he walked off like “i’m good bro im good”
at first i was thinking how did a bear decide its gonna sit next to this guy out of everywhere it coulda gone, then the camera panned to 50 more of them
👤💬see Wilem EASY!!!
russians man
joe rogan watched this like 1000 times
Bro said aye aye aye like that was bout to stop him from getting slimed 😂
“They biting today?”
He&#39;s just checking on how the fish are biting today
Hey man, nice view there. I am joining you hope that’s okay.
Camera pulls up, twenty more grizzlies in a two second shot.
Calm bear.😎
&quot;Oh shit, was I supposed to bring the sandwiches this time?&quot;
I wanna pet a bear now-<br><br>THEY LOOK SO FLUFFYYYYYY
He looked so happy and pleased to be there lol
Bro didnt even bother to mention there are like a gazillion other bears in that river 😭
as the old adage says<br>&quot;camera man never dies&quot;
He probably watched men fish before amd was hopeimg he was fishing to bring a fish in. Or he was full from a huge meal and was sizeing the man up or just curious because he didnt geel threatened and didnt want an altercation and knew this guy wouldnt and if he did  create and altercation the bear finish him
You catch anything today....
I DON&#39;T THINK I SIT NEXT TO HIM! John P.
It&#39;s just Smokey the bear❤🎉
Should’ve offered it a beer, maybe it would have stayed a little longer.
UHH GUYS?! IS THIS FREDDY FAZBEAR?! 🤯🐻🤯
bear is vibing 🐻
Bears are chill like that?
He is waiting for a good Catch to come by. Any fish here ?
I want to see a bear in real life but a friendly one please 🐻
Never camp near a body of water, of course you&#39;re gonna increase the risk of running a cross a bear when you&#39;re right next to a stream or river....duh
If you look closely it looks like the bear’s smiling 😊
<b>yawn</b> there&#39;s my favourite resting spot...<br>... Oh hello tasty human, nice weather isn&#39;t it?
Guys will see this and just be like &quot;hell yeah&quot;
Bear’s wondering where the guy goes for a shit …
Hahahahaha,  Teddy Bears picknick.
Who else was expecting bear to sit on a chair?
😃
Paddington gotten very big
Is this seat taken? I couldn’t bear to be a bother so I’ll just sit here.
How bout them Packers huh?
if i was a bear, i definetly would be the chillest animal on the planet, and that fur, i could lay down anywhere and just sleep until im hungry, get some food and immediately lay down to sleep again
The bear left when he found out he was a lawyer. Scared the heck out of him.
Bear just pulled up and wanted to hang
&quot;oh my god is that freddy fazbear? har har har har&quot;
red dead 3 gameplay footage
Bro there are over 30 of them daafuqq
Definition of low-key terrifying
Trying to wrap my head around being in an eco system where the bears saturate the landscape like gazelle
Why did I think the bear was going to sit in the chair 😂
&quot;Anything biting?&quot; <br><br>Just one old fisherman stopping to greet another.
The cure for constipation!
You must be an idiot to be close to bears like that. I have zero tolerance for these bullshits. Then something happens and is the animal fault.
Poor guy just wanted a beer, not a bear
Шутки про русских и балалайку были?
Me, waiting for the bear to sit in the camping chair beside him, safe to say I am bitterly disappointed
The man were lucky that the bear forgot it was a bear while it enjoy the wiew😅
Damn I didn’t know he was chill like that
Bear: “Hi Scott, you’re early today”<br>Dude: “Morning Griz, beautiful day, eh”<br>Bear: “A beautiful day indeed, Scott”
TOTAL BS!!!
Look at the chair .... soooo PHOTO SHOPPED!!!
I was sitting on a bench in a park ... with a girl ... late one night. I got a feeling that we were being watched. When I looked behind me there was a fox sitting on a wall a couple of feet away watching us. We don&#39;t have bears in the UK.
Give him a beer
the bear is commonly known as the scary animal but the mountains and bear look so beautiful
&quot;Nice day isnt it?
Cameraman never dies
The bear is so calm here. It’s funny

It&#39;s saving the human as a palate cleanser.
tough month innit bruv
Bro looks fresh outta hibernation 😂😂
I don&#39;t know, maybe he just ate. Otherwise, the guy would be under a lot of unbearable pain.&quot;
i wanna hug him
i got anxious when i saw that the gun was closer to the baer than it was to him.
The most powerful mammal and the most intelligent mammal side by side. Something cool about that.
Hey Frank, catcha anything today? Water looks good.
I doubted the camera was operated by remote control lol
Yeah, the camera saved him.😂
ANYONE ELSE SEE THE RIFLE?
This is the bears front room not ours
Your so lucky it didnt maul you dont be so stupid in the future
I have your scent.
Well fed....well mannered....enjoying human company.....
You must be very big if he was afraid of you 😂😂🤷‍♀️🥺
Just wanted a bear hug by the looks of it 🤗😲
I didn’t think that saying « hey hey hey hey hey hey hey… » was the thing to do to scare 1 ton of muscle and sharp claws and stuff… i’ll remember that

bear: long time ago.....
One of my all-time favorite YouTube clips.
Brown bears eat 30 salmon (20,000 calories) a day
what brand is this dog ?
A truly beautiful moment
Wow and God Bless
He looks like he wants to ask if you know where the lights touch the earth
Fuck. That.
CGI bear...look out the outline of it
I can’t help but to pet him<br>😇
Maybe the bear is curious about dwelling with humans.... surely he has observed dogs at some point in his life 🤔
Just saying with a tongue like that, mama bear must be a happy wife
Oh I love bears so much.  The utter beauty.
Bear: thank you for not making a scene. Everybody else just screams loudly and try to match the size. Its honestly ridiculous and annoying
Bet that dude needed a new pair of pants after
Bear passed the vibe check
I don&#39;t know but this bear also seems to be sort of old. See alot of videos like this were it&#39;s a oldish bear just chilling and minding their business
Not sure how exactly you walk around with those balls of steel but great video 👍
Imagine if that was a loved one of his who passed away and reincarnated into a bear..
“Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye”<br><br>Ah yes, this man understood the bears only weakness…Canadians.
Bear comes near: 💀💀💀💀<br>Bear sits and looks like a puppy: awwww ❤😌😭🥰<br>Bear gets ups and walks really close: EYYYYeyeyey 💀💀💀💀💀💀
the bear was not hungry, otherwise the story would have been different
why is it friend shaped?
Human: &quot;ay ay ay ay ay ay&quot;<br>The bear: &quot;who cares about u bro?&quot;
he literally smiled while he sat next you you enjoying the scenery
One thing certain, the bear wasn’t hungry!
if not friend then why friend shaped?
If you are a gun crazy paranoid American you will never understand this video.
I wonder if the guy shit himself?
,guy shits himself
Gun not reachable anymore... you would have been fucked.
That’s a dog in a bear suit.
Think he was after some honey
No words can describe that moment of silence when the bears sat there and makes that eye contact and gives the universal nod
The other bears probably dared him to do it

You&#39;ll get the next fish i catch...  Bros! 😎<br>Aaaand that&#39;s how it went down. Nobody ate or mauled anyone! 😇
❤
I&#39;ve never seen a more chill bear than this one
Wow I love this phenotype
I got this recommended out of nowhere for some reason 💀
You people comment as if that is a kitten
What an absolutely beautiful creature!   Not sure my body would have allowed me to sit so calmly as this beast walked up and sat down but God bless um’! 🤭
Bear just wants to know if the fishing is any good at that spot.
My Brain Tought the bear was gonna Sit on the chair
How?
The bear yawn 😭.
Bears are beautiful
High quality bear suit
This video deserved 93 Million Views
That guy has big ones😮
This is not a role model for human behavior.
He like you’re a weirdo, I’m out all that staring is pissing me off
&quot;Wow thats crazy!!&quot;<br><b>Camera pans to a dozen bears</b><br>&quot;Oh bro, you&#39;re out of bounds right now!&quot;
Lonely floof is lonely.
So after playing BG3... i have questions
fishing buddy
You should’ve pet him
Why will one bear sit by you and another attack you?<br>Except a momma, I get that.
seems like he just got done eating, you got lucky😭
Imagine you were dying and you crawled up to a cliff to watch the sunset and a bear just sat next to you and watched it with you.
As a kid, this was very cute and cool. As an adult, this is terrifying.
That is definitely one of will Ferrell&#39;s bears
If it&#39;s black, fight back. <br>If it&#39;s brown, get down.<br>If it&#39;s white, good night.
The Bear Necessities
Casually just takes a yawn 🥱 and scans about.. What a beautiful animal 🐻
The bear was thinking, &quot;wow, how is that possible? Saturn has many rings, but doesn&#39;t have any single fingers&quot;
Thats a grizzly bear... If it was a black bear id feel a little different. But a griz, woof scary
He looks so cute. I mean I am terrified of bears but come on.
Is this real?<br>Or am i stupid
Is that a chromed or stainless pump shotgun with polymer furniture between the camera and the bear?
Beautiful infinite powerful royal bear gods creation.
I thought he’ll sit next to him on the chair😂
Bear is listening to alice in chains thinking about Salmon.
You may think this is wholesome but...<br>THATS A BROWN BEAR!  THEY ARE BIG AND MEAN, Black bears is smaller then these bear and scared sometime.<br>BROWN BEARS WILL CHASE YOU FOR MILES!!!!!
I thought that he would sit on the chair.
400 kg or more?
i’m sure bears have the capacity to sit and enjoy the beauty of nature
I can&#39;t believe people fell for it. This is clearly another bear, dressed in a human jacket, that is doing the filming.
When two dudes just wanna hang... Beautiful! 🤗
🐻: hey man do you know where the picnic baskets are
Windy, eh?
Big fella just wants some tasty salmon
“You’re good homie I just ate”
SO lucky the guy was sitting DOWNwind, and the bear has lousy eyesight!
Oof. This reminds me of that movie Grizzly Man.
Bear: &quot;Hey, brother.  It&#39;s been a day, I could use a beer.  Seriously, you don&#39;t have any?  I&#39;m outta here.&quot;
Wow😮😊
camera not shaking or anything!! but what if the bear just sat on the chair lol
نعم انا قادم من داك مقطع 😂😂😂
Oh you&#39;re into fishing? Me too bro, me too.
I thought the bear was going to grab that Remington shotgun and starting shooting fish.
Take a seat mate 🍻
Completely as advertised. Was hoping he’d hit us with a jump scare. 9/10
Oh, you like fish too? Cool.
Bear: So how&#39;s the fishin?
Yeah nevermind i wouldnt win
The bear probably wanted to make the first step but was too scared for rejection
Imagine unexpectedly coming face-to-face with the most deadliest animal of all: man.
He’s like did you catch anything? I don’t feel like fishing today 😂
Oh nothing to see here. Just an Apex predator and it’s prey 😂
Love teddy bears
I wonder for who was the second chair next to him ?
bear: nice fishing pole, catch me summin?
i actually expected him to sit in the chair ngl
Buffalo by13
Acted like a surfer; checking out the action before paddling out.
Pretty sure I may have shartted if I was that person filming
He just wanted to sit and talk about life for a while !
リラックスしてるように見える
Best way to prevent bear attacks is to make sure they don&#39;t go hungry in winter.
&quot;catch the game last night?&quot;<br>&quot;which one?&quot;<br>&quot;eh, any of em&quot;
Богдан в кадре
Him: “heyheyheyheyheyheyhey!”<br>Bear: <b>Understandable, have a great day.</b>
Title: BEAR ON CAMERA 📷 BY <b>most dangerous organism in world</b>
Filmed by Chuck Norris.
Best bear costume ever
Clickbait, the chair was empty all along, the bear was not brave enough to sit next to the human
So Cute! They adorable :3
Dangerous AF, but this is still a classic. &quot;Oh yeah so, Im a 1200lb apex predator and your on my creek run.Just woke up from a nap sooooo...&quot;
If its black fight back if its brown lie down
&quot;Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye&quot; is now my go-to defense strategy against bears
Are you sure that’s not a dog in a bear’s body?
dwight would dislike this video saying it&#39;s impossible the bear didn&#39;t attack the man
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=72">1:12</a> Bear is like, dude, Im not even hungry. I could&#39;ve mauled you a while ago. Chill out.
Genetic memory, the transference of environmental visual images to offspring.<br>What that means is that the bear recognizes his hunting grounds, as did his great grandfathers before him, back 10K ya, 20K ya, the mountain ranges in the background barely changed.<br>What that means, is that the recent appearance of humans at the falls, is a curiosity, not perceived as prey, otherwise, the videos would be live reenactments of Timothy Treadwell&#39;s last moments of confrontation with reality. <br>A Large Male Katmai Grizzly weighing more than 1000 lbs displays his jaw opening, sufficient to envelope half a man&#39;s girth below the ribcage, in one bite. Then, doing the drooling bear drool display, a gnarly drool that large Grizzlys do, drooling.<br>The apex predator, chasing elk herds, 20km runs in 30 minutes, catching, killing and eating elk not fit enough to outrun a grizzly. <br>Salmon full, attenuating the appetite for other convenient sources of food, the strange alien visitors to the riverbank, and their strange language, &#39; Aye.. aye..  aye..  aye..  aye..  ! &#39;
&quot;So...any luck with the fish ? Are they taking at all ? &quot;. x)
The whole time the bear is thinking to himself....Fish or Human?
He&#39;s like hey bro catch me a fish don&#39;t just sit there
This video shows us that a peaceful world is possible
My next step after bear left, would be, change my underwear.
Second chair is for the soul that left the camera guys body
keep up the awesome bear content!!
that free seat. where was that pperson?
Nice stainless steel 870 express
Such bravery to sit next to one dangerous animal... What a brave bear!
Bear sad ..why human no invite me to sit on chair beside him
I really want to hug it, if i knew it wouldn&#39;t eat me alive
Salmon run.   You can see several fishing down below.  They taste way better to bears than we do, provide better nutrition for the winter nap.  So to him, the human isn&#39;t food.  Just an interesting diversion while he&#39;s digesting his lunch.  If he was starving.....
George go sit in front….i will come up from behind…..
If sitting by a grizzly in the forest with a view of the river by the mountains on a rainy day isn&#39;t your life&#39;s motive then you probably need therapy.
thats badass
bear sits next to guy
Nice weather we’re having today ah?
Next to? More like metres away? Usually clickbait lying titles on pootube
Joe Rogan is one million of these views.
Shitty mid 2010s video quality.
I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to stop myself from petting him
Bear: Catch ya la… I mean see ya later
That seems like a wise bear.
thats mama luigi to you!
If not friend why friend shaped
is that all the footage they found?
Bro even looks happy ☠️
Interesting, how bears will just quietly admire a view. Can&#39;t think of another animal that does that.
Oh my God my heart would have stopped.
Как русский человек, могу сказать, что это очень правдоподобно.
It was a sign of dominance by the bear that was checking out what&#39;s happening in its territory. They where interested in fish and checking out competitors. Man was not a problem so the bear went away pacefully
Fisherman, fisherman, catch me a fish?!😊
This is amazing, incredible. What a moment.
Bear: &quot;Mate, I dint even see you there.&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=74">1:14</a> Is that guy Finnish?<br>&quot;Ei Ei Ei Ei Ei Ei Ei Ei Ei Ei Ei Ei Ei Ei&quot; <br>&quot;No No No No No No No No No No No No No No&quot;
Freddy Fazbear? Is that you?
Pot twist: The camera man is also a bear.
bear: hey. how’s it going. beautiful day for it. it’s view like these that really makes it all worth it, am i right?<br><br>human: sir, this is the most terrifying moment of my life
Looks like the bear could use a strong cup of coffee.
Dude is like “ayayayay” at the bear for getting close but was literally surrounded by bears the whole time 😭
Apparently bears are known for sitting and observing scenic environments. So this bear probably just admired the human&#39;s choice of scenery.
Good Vibes
Man: Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh EH<br><br>Bear: What? I thought its a human but now its a bird. This the last time Im playing truth or dare with the gang.
Chilling with Freddy Fazbear
The bear just wanted to get away from his wife
The bear got lucky that the man was not hungry
Bear obviously blind in the right eye 👁 🙄 👀
all of a sudden he  starts rambling about his life problems. problems with his girl etc, lol heck fire up some smoke im sure hed probly have a toke lol
If that was me, just know that my last thoughts were “oh he just wants a cuddle” 🤣🤣🤣
“Fish been bitin’ this mornin’?”🐻
Bear: Nice weather today, how are the fish biting?
epsJACKIYmaryMEforfoxcreek⚡🚬⚕️💍⛓️
The photographer should be thankful that Yogi wasn&#39;t hungry!
He’s about to ask the human back to his place for a couple beers and college football. What a wholesome guy.
bear: is the fishing going well today?
“Hey man. You got anymore of those brownies with the green stuff in it that I stole from your campsite earlier? You wanna order some Dominos?”.
That bear prob just wanted to watch the water with him and enjoy life with his new friend
Sits next to bears; get surprised when one walks near
Kudos for holding the camera so steady.
It&#39;s just another fine day in Russia.
&quot;Some nice weather we&#39;re having today&quot;
It’s so wonderful to come back to this vid from time to time. Joyful that this vid exists.
waltuh
This is the bearest bear I’ve seen
It’s behind you 🫣
Lucky for him to survived, usually humans are dangerous
JUzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz chillin
Bear: chill dude, it was a prank. Just look at your face in the camera
The guy panicked cuz the bear didn’t assault him
the guy is definitely abusing the law &quot;the operator always survives&quot;
dats a brown bear too dis nigga od blessed
The bear is like &#39;iv been fishing this river for years, got any beer&#39;
It would take all my willpower not to give the bear a big hug 😂
You could just take him home and give him a bowl of milk
The other bears probably dared him to do it 🤣
The bear is such a dangerous creature! Much more dangerous than a human.
Adorable bear enjoying in himself
The background is soo peaceful
I&#39;m surprised it didn&#39;t attack
The bear wants fish, He agreed with the guy  that has a great view of the other bears, and fish.<br>.
Cannabis bear
How it feels like of losing someone you love:
that&#39;s literallt the rl version of the animation about that bear asking for digestive cookies
I am 19 and never heard thing like this 😄<br>But everyday I get thousands of shitty things even the worst of worse and still I can&#39;t say out anything because I am not weak nor am I crybaby 😄
Katmai Alaska probably, near Brook falls. They’re very used to hoomans being around unfortunately. Salmon run. Fun fact, they eat the skin and brains only during the busy run only, don’t eat the actual pink meat.
Bro felt peaceful and wanted to sit alongside the moving meat.
He was like hey hey hey hey lol lucky the bear was after fish and not that hungry
That’s a guy in a bear suit
What do you call a 600lb bear?   SIR!
Glück gehabt.
That river was probably plentiful of salmon and that&#39;s the reason for all the bears and.. You know... Why the guy didn&#39;t become a meal.
Oi mate! U got any bugle on ya?
He’s like next time I’ll get you but right now I’m kinda tired
This video is just half waiting if the beer actually sits<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>oh wait no he does ok cool
He was beautiful and he was looking for a friend❤😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=42">0:42</a> cool
That bear is no fool, he is waiting for a snack.
His belly looks full
czy to Freddy Fazbear?
It&#39;s just bearing it&#39;s own business
Pet it
&quot;Brotha is this spot good im trynna get me some fishh too&quot;
Does a bear s**t in the woods? I don&#39;t know but I bet this guy will now.
Bear obviously speaks Canadian. Understanding ‘ey ey ey ey ey’ perfectly
Just 1 fisherman comparing tactics with another.
The bear: you have no enemies...
Would&#39;ve been funnier if the dude just taps the other chair offering the bear to sit together
Grizzly Adams comes to mind
this dude was probably scared shitless
Bear is closer to the bear gun than the human. A game of chicken ?
if he didnt record it no one would believe him
Uhr uhr uhr uhr uhr uhr uhr uhr uhr uhr
IF NOT FRIEND, THEN WHY FRIEND SHAPED???
The sound is horrible and superfluous!
I would be very tempted to pet it if he was sitting next to me
I like the idea that the guy recording has a gun ready and pointed at the bear while filming.
Dumb A_ _!!! Not the Bear!!! A picture isn&#39;t worth it... .. . Your life?!.😮
The guy did everything right.  Bear sits next to him.  Doesn&#39;t try to touch it or offer it food.  They just had a moment.  And when the bear moved in behind him, they guy just used verbal commands to say &quot;That&#39;s enough of that.&quot;  Plus he had a shotgun.  End of the day it was an awesome experience (probably for both of them).  No harm no foul.
You may think they look harmless until you remember what happened to Tim Treadwell.
Bear sits next to guy<br>Guy shits (pants) next to bear
You want a beer?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=63">1:03</a> Lol, the &quot;Sup.&quot; Gets me everytime
Bear&#39;s like:<br>So what we doing man
If someone took a picture of the two from behind that would’ve been a fire album cover
Balls of steel😮
Bear: &quot;So I&#39;m thinking of bumping my 401K by 2% this year&quot;<br>Man: : &quot;That what I did.  The retirement market has been decent in 2023.&quot;
Bear:Soooo? How goes your fishing trip today Buddy<br>I tell you i catched this Morning  a soooo big Salmon i swear!
try this in a small town
It&#39;s a little known fact that, just as humans don&#39;t want to run into bears, bears don&#39;t want to run into humans. It&#39;s nice that they can meet somewhere in the middle.
&quot;At least im wearing my brown pants&quot; said the bear 😂😂
Bro was chillin fr
They just look like dogs
If you didn&#39;t notice, that&#39;s a shotgun on the chair.
This bear an introvert like me, away from the party
Bro finally found the pic a nic basket and contentness in life
Bear looked old &amp; full. Probably just woke from a slumber.
The bear&#39;s mother/wife would&#39;ve been like &quot;are you crazy ? what if he had a gun huh ? think before doing stupid stunts&quot;
Bro said let me sit down and tell you about my day
bro has no enemies
Behind the cameraman were a bunch of 7’2 steroid dudes with guns, flamethrower, sleeping dart and a freaking tank lol
Im binging watching animal videos rn. First the pig drunk then rolls out, second the bird screaming tyler1, and then this.
He wanted a picnic basket
What a cutie batutie...
Why did God make these dangerous creatures so friendly looking
Good thing you didnt have any food on you!
The bear was like: so wassup can a loc come up to yo crib?
We now need guy sits next to bear.
The last guy that did this was bear food and found 3 days later with his girlfriend lightly digested.  Respect the bear.
Lucky bear.<br>Chilling by a river, with a fresh lunch next to him.
My dumb ass was waiting for it to get in the chair
Is that freddy fazbear?
Looks like a giant puppy.
Either the bear didn’t like the smell of your deodorant or just ate someone else at the base camp 😊
Cheeseburger 🍔?
Mishka !!!
When I was young my dad always told me to &quot;watch the river flow&quot;.  I assumed it was a form of meditation.
JESUS CHRIST IS THE TRUE LIVING ALMIGHTY GOD AMEN WHOOO ✝️🙏❤️🗡️👑
Bears are smart. Hairless ape = challenge, river of salmon = easy XP
Aww bear sit on grass what a life. 🐻🐻🐻
I come here time to time over the years. I can see the trending jokes at the time lol
Russia?
This bear knows the meaning of it all.
What a fabulous animal you were privileged to be in the presence of him..he’s so beautiful and relaxed I’d have sat on the chair next to him 😂😂❤looked in his eyes and gave him a kiss 💋 😂😂😂😂
That bear like,<br>&quot;You lucky i just ate&quot;
See the empty chair? Exactly. Bears full.
Bro just wanted a newport
Bear really wanted to sit in the chair.
Meanwhile me expecting him to sit on chair 🤣
I invited him over for dinner and drinks the other night and he ended up sleeping on my couch for a week.
Yeah, me too bear. Me too.
like looking at a giant dog
He even had a second chair for the bear.
After a long day of chasing prey, he wanted some peace
Bear: &quot;So...what&#39;re we watchin&#39;?<br>Mam: &quot;The lovely lake of course&quot;<br>Bear: &quot;Are you serious? Borrrrrrring, I&#39;m out.&quot;
He smiling waiting to see if he should do it
just two apex predators chilling by the riverside
that bear was low key checking out the shotgun calliber.<br><br>&#39;Ah 12 gauge slugs - good day to you sir&#39;
Bear be like ...I am full but I wonder if I can squeeze in one small snack?....na....not good to eat hetween meals. I&#39;m out. Vatch uou next time.
Wow. Sitting next to one of the most dangerous animals on earth and making it out alive? That’s one brave and lucky bear.
is that freddy fazbear
The other bears taking a dip below?
Y’all out here playing
👨‍🦳
This is why you buy a sling.<br>So your gun is on your shoulder, not out of reach under your f-ing lawn chair next to the bear.
Guy: HEY HEY HEY HEY<br><br>Bear: Chill bro
He didnt take the spare seat you left for him? Pretty rude
The claws on that thing. Wonder what buddy&#39;s heart rate got up to.
Here I was thinking, &quot;Wow! What a rare, random occurrence!&quot; Then the camera panned over...
I remember when this happened to me, we became friends and had adventures n stuff, I called him Ben,
Lucky  to be alive! what if he said  &quot;I&#39;m tired of fish and you&#39;&#39;re &quot;out of chicken? I&#39;ll try the human very rare&quot;
Note to self: To repel a bear, just say, “Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey…’
Bear be like: hey dude,whats up? no fishes today?
You’re in HIS neck of the woods. You, hooman, are his guest. Be grateful.
he just wanted some fish lol knew old guy had some 😂
I don&#39;t think saying &quot;eh eh eh eh eh&quot; would deter it if was about to maul you
I don&#39;t think bear gives a sh...t that there is a man next to him.
Idiot Human.
That bear are so much salmon he couldn’t care
lol scared of one bear pans camera, river full of bears
😰😰😰😰😰😰
cameraman: 😎😎😎
There are good and bad humans all animals can sense that..
It would rip my liver out and rip off my face with its claws while I was still alive.<br><br>And yet, I <b>really</b> want to hug it.
Bro must be in russia
怖すぎる…w生きた心地しなかったろうな…
If so dangerous, why so cuddly looking?
My question is...<br><br><br><br><br><br>If not friend, why friend shaped?
Der sitzt  da al wenn er sagen wollte Petri heil alter na schon was gefangen  ich sach dir datt die beißen  heute aber auch wiedrr kacke muss am Wetter liegen watt nimmste den für einen Köder ? Ach sach an Mehlwürmer kl.Tipp vom Profil  nimm mal Fliegen unschlagbar  die Dinger naja ick will mal wieder mach jutt wa bis ander mal😂😂😂😂😂
...and precedes to eat him.
I don&#39;t even think it was going to attack, they behave almost like big dogs sometimes. But you wouldn&#39;t stick your hand out to pet it just incase 😅
Bro pondering
This is start to a joke right? Bear walks up sits next to a guy…
Where is this place😮
I thought this dude had balls of steel... Until the camera panned over to about 15 more bear.... Then I KNEW this dude had balls of steel
He just wants to chill wit his homies
Bear : &quot;wassup Frank&quot;
If not friend, why friend shape
Obviously this is an American Akita, not a bear.
Is that Freddy Fazbear??!!
Buddy&#39;s got bigger balls and I do
The bear:ayo grab me a beer son<br><br>This guy: what<br><br>The bear:what!?
I wasn’t expecting him to turn around and there’s like 30 grizzlies in the river lol
If that is a shotgun on the ground you should be careful. The bear could have taken it and shoot you...
Bear is just like man its a rough world out there😂😂
&quot;Soooo, uhh...you come here often?&quot;
At the end the bear was like damn what? I wasn&#39;t even looking at you. Whatever.
&quot;All your fish are belong to me today... And you know what&#39;s happening if you fail to catch fish today, right?&quot;
I know this is definitely not, but its crazy how much it resembles the californian grizzly bear
tell me thats not a morbidly obese dog
A good boy!
🙄🙇🙇🧍🏃🏃🙄🥴
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=63">01:03</a> how you doin 🤨
I would have popped my pants
I have wondered about this deal for some time. Could this bear possibly have been taken in by humans as an orphan cub and then let loose at some point. Since then, has it been seeking the companionship of humans it had as a cub. It senses people&#39;s fear and is just trying to warm up to them. If only bears could talk.
Croatians: 🥵 mmmmmm 🍔
Guy: aye heyheyheyheyheyheyhey<br>Bear: understandable, have a nice day!
&quot;Rough day?&quot;
This video has joe rogan written all over it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=74">1:14</a> my dude reacted to a bear the way i react to my cat trying to eat a dead bug
The bear seems like such a distinguished gentleman.
This is what it looks like when you film a bear while pooping.
GOD is going to have all animals fight back for what humans have done to them. GOD has perfect timing. 💣🔥

Hey, human! What&#39;s up? Fishing?<br>Yeah, this is a great fishing spot.<br>Plenty of juicy salmon and all kinds of small fish for the cubs. <br>What&#39;s it like without fur?<br>Oh, got to run. Nice talking to you, human.
Luckiest man in the universe.
Is this a gun
Good thing the bear dident start to eat the man alive.
Brave bear
Proof that camera man never dies
Life could be dream life could be dreaam

곰은 사람을 찢어
Beautiful bear
Bear: Dude life is hard.
This has got to be Russia
Bear: This human would be a good lunch.<br>Human: I AM CAMERAMAN.<br>Bear: Understandable. Have a nice day.
don&#39;t run away. That could initialize his, predatory behavior.
Ну присел бы на кресло, рядом же😅
&quot;anyways, im gonna leave now. Have a tremendous day!&quot;
wife sit next to him😂😂😢
Youre very fortunate to have been allowed to experience something that msy only happen once in a million years. AND to have gotten it recorded!!!.Congratulations friend👌
This may seem random but I grew up in the church and thought that was the whole religion just going to church every Sunday and eventually stopped going and started to do my own thing.  I wanted to find the purpose of life because I knew everything we worked for would pass away.  I was looking at all the religions unbiasedly, looking historically so I wouldn&#39;t have blind faith. Later on I had a tug on my heart to open up the Bible and saw the Jesus people talked about was completely different from what was in the Bible.  I started to draw closer to the higher power and had a supernatural encounter with him and I felt his love and peace and was indescribable and overwhelming almost but was out of this world and everything looked brand new like it was the first time seeing it when I looked outside literally.  I wasn&#39;t expecting the encounter either and was shocked when it happened. (I don&#39;t do drugs or alcohol) His name is Jesus and I’m here to tell you it’s about a relationship not religion and he is real and did die on the cross for you willingly and thinks you as the only person and was thinking of you while dying. You don’t have to believe my experience you can seek yourself, I suggest you start in the minimalistic facts of the resurrection because if the resurrection is false than Christianity is false. All we chase in this life is temporary think about your eternal life.
The bear was like do you come here often? There is an awesome view just a little ways down from here you should check it out and take some pictures it’s absolutely stunning.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=63">1:03</a> wholesome, the bear trying to communicate with you.

Why is there only 12 likes
That man has balls of steel.
cameraman never dies
“long day huh. me too man, me too”
I’m guessing it’s the guys pet bear
Cute bear❤❤
Bear was thinking bout if he wanted to eat him or not. He decided to go get some fish instead lol
When the bear was sitting, he was thinking what he wants to eat on his breakfast - fish or something else. )
Naah making fun of your manhood is more fun to me.. ROFL🤣🤣 do you have a chain dick.. ROFL🤣🤣
Il a démarré… quel bel ours avec ses oreilles blondes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=51">0:51</a> “Hey, how’s it going?”
This makes me want to be A Bear 🐻
Any other time of year and you&#39;re likely dead. Bears are so chill during salmon spawning season.
It amazes me . That I’m mesmerized by something that I’d be scared to death of. If  face to face with one. They fascinate me.
Fearsome beast near the bear.
is this freddy fazbear?
Lovely horse
This is unbearable
Your&#39;e in his spot. Animals have a connection with the frequency in specific spots on the earth.
Only men (and bears) will understand this 🗿
can I pet that dawg
The bear too knows that camera-mans are invincible
Bears are such interesting animals when hungry they will do and kill anything to eat but when full bears may be on of the kindest mammals there is.
Most normal day in russia
&quot;Hello breakfast, I will hang out with you before eat you&quot;
he sit
I guess &quot;cameraman never dies&quot; should officially be a theorem or something, like Pythagoras theorem.
not so cute and cuddly when they are lapping the blood out of your chest cavity.
It&#39;s all good cuz cameraman never dies
Shes looking for Coda
the way he says &quot;heyheyheyheyhey&quot; at the end, as if it was going to make any difference had the bear had intention of eating the guy😭😭
That bear has balls
&lt;3
Bear figures ? If your not going to offer him a Hamms Beer , he’ll find his own beers , Later
grizzly bear, much bigger and more dangerous than the black bear.
How&#39;s the fishing ?
Me trying to talk to my crush:
Hopefully he packed plenty of clean underwear on the trip.
Rumor has it that all the other bears still talk about this punking of a human to this very day.
Dwl😂 he looking for a easy fish fats food😂
This was a message to humanity - please be like this guy and shoot photos only!
Just look at them can&#39;t believe they can skin someone alive.
“ Yo Derek! I’ll give you 50 salmon to go sit next to that guy!”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=47">0:47</a> &quot;So what&#39;s for dinner?&quot;
中に人が入っている
When you try to hangout with the cool kid’s table:
Man I wish bears were tame and cuddly, I just wanna be able to hug them
Another prove that the cameraman never dies
“The Revenant”
I hate to be that guy but, isn&#39;t that a Kodiak? The larger more aggressive version of the grizzly bear?
いや食われるて
The bear is probably thinking:<br><br>Dude&#39;s gotta take his eyes off that picnic basket at some point
guys is that Freddy fazbear
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay is standard bear procedure.
Watching a video of bear attack in red dead redemption 2 then get this recommended to me like 😳
The Bear: &quot;bro, I can&#39;t keep up man, I can barely afford anything in this economy&quot;
Brother bear was just trying to chill with you dude, relax. If he wanted to attack you he would have done so while walking up. You can tell by his body language that he wasn&#39;t hostile.
A normal day in Mother Russia 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Good thing that this bear wasn&#39;t hungry...
“I didn’t know he was chill like that”
lol just noticed the bear is closer to the gun then the guy
That old bear look like he was on his last leg... just coming by to get one more look at the river. Oh look there&#39;s a human &#39;hi there&#39; !
H&#39;es lucky he wasn&#39;t attacked.  Yelling hey isn&#39;t going to stop the bear.
Happy bear
&quot;What&#39;s up, Todd? Haven&#39;t seen you in a bit. Where have you been this whole time? We haven&#39;t met here in so long :/&quot;<br><br>-The bear
The fact that its a literal grizzly which are one of the most dangerous and territorial animal&#39;s
just two bros
Waiting for the man to catch him a fish.
Bears just checkin up seeing why this man Has such huge balls filming a river full of grizz in the first place.
The &quot;ey ey ey ey!&quot; part really got me
Was sitting on some stone steps leading down the water while fishing and happened to look down to see a water moccasin  stretched out basking in the Sun between my feet.  I didn&#39;t hurt it even though they are poisonous.  Figured if a snake was that bold far be for me to interfere with it.
The bear loves the view too
That bears in serious danger, he jast sat next to a russian.
Just avid fisher &quot;people??&quot; Sharing a moment.
R.I.P - “Ey”
The bear is russian thats why
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=22">0:22</a> bear finding his bed 😂😂
Guys it’s Freddy Fazbear
キャンプ中に偶然熊が近くまで来てしまった、みたいな動画かと思って見てたら、最後バチクソいっぱいおるやん。
iz dat da freddi fastbear?<br>hur hur hur hur hur
Fun fact: You have way better of a chance being killed by a human sitting next to you than any other creature on this planet.
guess the guy&#39;s nationality
Ah yes<br>Something that totally won&#39;t maul my face off if hungry
Pet him
This is so scary
........ bear eats guy.......guy is dead......
Dude had a shotgun right  next to him too lol, bear and the guy were both lucky they were equally calm.
That was gangsta
That takes some huevos.
The bear is so cute
Lucky he was not hungry :)
I cant believe im sitting next to the most dangerous thing on Earth-The Bear Allegedly.
This gotta be an internet meme legend
If it&#39;s brown, lay down. If it&#39;s black, fight back. If it&#39;s white, goodnight.
It&#39;s so unfair that something so cute will also rip you into pieces in half a second
bear fight, bare handed, bare... NAKED? oh yes please.
calm
What beer commercial is this?
I love how the bear could have instantly one shotted the camera guy at any time but instead he’s like “sup… nice weather eh? So you got any like, snacks?”
I wanna sit with Bear
Remember this up Alaska , the salmon run stop late September. That 4 month till he hibernate bear need to fatten up body fat to last 4 months of sleeping. <br>  The old timers say Iam not nuts to be out there after the fish is gone. You’re just a big steak underneath.
This bear is thinking,  if I just didn&#39;t eat that fish an hour ago, this guy would be pretty tasty.😮
i didn&#39;t expect the part where the bear actually went ahead and sat next to the guy
BING chillin
I&#39;m glad they recovered the camera from his corpse so we could see this
fajny miś
Bear : This seat taking?<br>Guy : Ay ay ay ay ay
its not that deep 😔
the bear maybe sensed guy wasnt a threat just wanted see what guy was doing
Bold man but you could hear his heart drop at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=75">1:15</a>
His stomach was already full.

My favourite kind of dog!

Bear: yo bro

Want that gun don&#39;t you Zed? Go ahead and pick it up..
Camera Man.

Average bear encounter in Russia
If not friend, why friend shaped?
Bear: &quot;Yo whats good bro...Can I chill here a bit it&#39;s got a little tough for me today so yeah&quot;
23 bears is wild
&quot;A a a a a a a a a a a a a&quot; - This man
lol
Bear: &quot;Nice day for sum fishin&#39; huh?&quot;
The nice weather and temperature made it a bear-able experience
Obi wan: Hello there….
The bear be like: Bear with me, and let&#39;s enjoy nature.
That just made my day what a beautiful moment ❤ <br>How can anyone kill these beautiful creatures..
Beautiful day, ain&#39;t it Jim?
I understand that the bear could probably disembowel that man right then and there, but goddamn he fluffy and cute
Thats crazy he probably looked at the man as an object
*Bear sits<br>*Midwest emo riff starts playing<br>Bear: &quot;life is hard&quot;
I had an encounter where my tent was surrounded by a small group of elk. A couple of them tried eating my tent.
Every time the bear open its mouth i just hold my breath
I was expecting the bear to sit on the chair lol
Bears are literally dogs jus bigger
think, he waited for your fish, hungry bear :-)
lolollo
HA
That’s just kenai from brother bear
Did you ask him if he crapped in the wood?
&quot;Hey man, it&#39;s been a minute, how&#39;s the wife&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh you know she&#39;s doing good, better than ever&quot;
bro was rethinking his whole life.
Can I pet that daaawg?
i didn&#39;t know he was chill like that
Beer me dude!?
More proof that the cameraman never dies
I thought bear will be sitting in the chair next to the guy
He couldnt even run away
I&#39;ll bet you have a very difficult time finding pants that fit.
I remember seeing a very old comment on this videos saying that bears have the intelligence to enjoy nature
Beautiful. Incredible. And an absolute nope from me, the video is more than close enough!
The bear&#39;s fur might be brown, but not as brown as the my pants would&#39;ve been if I was sitting there in the guy&#39;s place
Freddy Fazbear just gave bro a visit 😭💀
Bear: <b>walks up, licks lips, considers if this is indeed an ideal spot to sit, looks at chair, decides to just appreciate the view</b>
Can i bum a smoke
He probably wanted a beer.
たまたまこの一頭が近づいて来たのかと思ったら、カメラが最後右向いた瞬間絶望した
har har har har har
It be like that
Why the hell would anybody be this stupid ?
Yup. Thats a bear and its sitting next to a guy.
Guy is probably like: why is he sitting there???!???
Depression.
This is the ultimate proof that the cameraman never dies. damn…
“Ey ey ey ey ey ey ey”
Good fishing here? Nice out today ain’t it. Sure is. Ya wanna beer?
&quot;So how&#39;s it going with you, human?&quot;
give him a dart, what you doing bro?
He ask help me
Bear said , when you catch a fish im taking it...
I bet the guy is a Russian.
That&#39;s insane.
Man, the wife kicked me out of the den.
The bear was full but 100% sizing him up as a potential threat or food source. Stop personifying animals, especially predators. It ends with the bear getting killed for its natural behaviour.
😁🤣😂
holy mackerel I was not prepared for the camera to turn around and there be like 30 more bears I&#39;ve only seen one irl
His arse hole must of been going from a 5 cent piece to a basketball hoop involuntary..would of shit on myself 100 percent
the fact that  john cena is not moving from that chair
lol. one bear... quickly becomes many bears... wtf
Bear: Nice view mate<br>Guy: hey ey ey ey ey ey ey ey<br>Bear: Bro chill. I just want to remind you about your extended car insurance
Is the empty chair for this guys balls?
Wow,  once in a lifetime  for almost  nobody and he caught it on camera
Bear sits next to guy....for some reason I thought he was going to sit in the chair.😁
&quot;Hey Jack, bet 6 fishes you can&#39;t sit besides that human without becoming a carpet&quot;<br>&quot;Bet.&quot;
ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
I&#39;m coming back to this video, I wonder:<br>There all these bears up at the river, fishing no doubt. I wonder if that fact meant that the photographer here wasn&#39;t in any great danger. Clearly there wasn&#39;t a big concern about food, otherwise there wouldn&#39;t have been so many bears so close to one another that aren&#39;t fighting or anything. I wonder if that&#39;s why they were pretty apathetic to the photographer.
OH CHOLERA CZY TO FREDDY FAZBEAR?!
Is that a Freddy Fazbear
Where was this filmed?
Bears are not stupid.  If they feel that you are a threat they will be aggressive.  Dude you just proved a point and a ? People have had about grizzlies for years. Kudos 👍
&quot;Hey human, nice spot ya picked out here.&quot;
Nice to have some company round here old fella now let me tell you a story
That bear could have had a nice snack of the crazy nature loving clown human.... A nice snack!! 🐻😋
This is why bears are the best animal on earth
tf? where are the jokes about the camera man?
Um, guys? Is this Freddy Fazbear?
dint know bro was chill like that
“Lovely weather innit?”
the bear was terrified of the power of the cameraman
LOOK R. ...
It&#39;s  me 😊
Men look at this and say Hell Yeah
Shut up and let me die in peace waltuh
Everyone saying how &quot;cute and wholesome&quot; this is has no idea that man was 1 second away from looking like a half eaten burrito. Bears are not cute.
When you come back from the bathroom, sit at the bar next to a stranger thinking it&#39;s your friend but after a sentences length you realize you have no clue who this person is. Menawhile your friend is two spots over taking down an appetizer.
good doggo
It’s incredibly prestigious to have the world’s most powerful mammal-predator of all time be non-aggressive toward you.
Please don&#39;t accept the digit@l currency or the Artifici@l intelligence (ai) system that is coming, it is against GOD. who have ears let him hear.!
JESUS  is coming soon and JESUS is the only way to salvation accept JESUS as your LORD and SAVIOR today!!
Don&#39;t take the v@ccine trust in the LORD ALMIGHTY and if you already taken it please pray to GOD about it because it is a deception!!!!
looking for his marmalade sandwich
I like &quot;a a a a a a a a&quot;
Are you Freddy Fazbear&#39;s?
this pic goes hard ngl <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbE53XUtVw0&amp;t=43">0:43</a>
I don’t feel sorry for anyone who gets killed by wild animals. If you willingly put yourself in their territory, you assume the risks and have to accept any outcome.
Bear: hello human mind if I stay whit for a while ik I&#39;m on your predators but I&#39;m having a ruff day
Actually he&#39;s standing: 🤓
Is this bear getting any revenue from all these views?
Animals even predators don&#39;t want to fight all the time.<br>Fighting expends energy, energy is needed to live. Places with water are neutral territory.
Bear may be huge, may have fangs and claws, but if you “hei hei hei” him, he will leave
Bear knows cameraman never dies 😂
look how big that thing is nature is truly amazing
I heard a click, assuming he was cocking his gun just in case?
Bear: &quot;Hey, human.&quot;<br>Human: 😮<br>Bear: &quot;Nevermind.&quot;
How&#39;s the fishin here?
THAT BEAR WUZ JUST ?OLD ,TIRED,/ TO TIRED TO FUCK SHIT UP
I can see his soul leaving his body
