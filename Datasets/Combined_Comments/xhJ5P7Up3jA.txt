I will never forget how I went nuts when I first saw this trailer
Jessy, what good taste you have (Duskwood)
So you&#39;ve found yourself watching the trailer after 4 years?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=141">2:21</a> IT Chapter 2
they&#39;re hungru :(
people of the comment section, i was told these 2 movies were absolute trash so i didnt have an interest for 5 years, ill tell u something, i hate it when others tell u one thing about a movie but then u finally watch it yourself and it is one of the best franchises i have ever watched, brought me to tears
Old 90s TV movie one was better despite being so cheesey. Dialogue ruined this one. Millennial writers 100%
I love this movie so much.
It: Chapter Two continues brings the Losers Club back to Derry, Maine to reunite and defeat Pennywise for good. It’s pretty frightening at times, emotional with it’s music and scenes, and gives me a good feeling once it’s over.
This is probably the best adult casting I’ve seen in any movie and most of the lines got me goosebumps, especially “YOU LIED AND I DIED!!!”.
This movie is better then the first one
Released
I didn&#39;t know you where into scary stuff, Jessy.👻
This movie so fire 20/10
I only saw It a year ago and at the end I was wondering what happens if Pennywise comes back? I guess now I’ll be able to find out. Once my heart stops thumping in my throat. Anyone know if that’s normal?😮
Probably one of the best trailers out there.
Movies sucked...the old one was much better

Where... is he?
Can I pick a piece of your hairs?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=53">0:53</a> <br>Nah bro it’s Trevor from gta 5
There were so many plotholes in this film!! Can anyone answer these cause it&#39;s driving me nuts!<br><br>1) Surely the group would have stayed together for a few more years in Derry before they became old enough to move away? But yet they keep saying it&#39;s been 27 years since they saw each other and all their memories together are as them at 13. Surely they&#39;d still know each other at 18😂<br><br>2) It&#39;s stated in the first movie that IT couldn&#39;t kill Bev because she wasn&#39;t afraid. Well the little girl Vicky wasn&#39;t afraid (she actually looked excited) and yet IT bit her head off. So does it feed on fear or not? <br><br>3) Beverly smacked her dad over the head so hard that he would have been hospitalised. Yet she doesn&#39;t get arrested for attempted murder?<br><br>4) IT is strong enough to create terrifying hallucinations and get them all to see the same thing at once but he isn’t strong enough to kill them? He had to get Henry to go after them for him. It was laughable😂<br><br>5) There are at least 2 missing children by the time they kill IT. The town would be crawling with police, fbi and searches. Yet they all jump into a lake in complete isolation when the police would be all over it. <br><br>6) How did Stanley or his wife get all of their addresses so fast and at the same time? It was like 48 hours. <br><br>I know it&#39;s a movie but the realism is stupid. However, the scene where Ritchie throws a rock at ITs face and angers it into petrifying him was awesome 👌 best scene of the two movies.
Alright lemme watch IT Chapter 2 again 😅
I&#39;m from Jessy&#39;s link
This is not Ronald McDonald this is pennywise the dancing clown
I wish there was a movie called it vs five nights at Freddy&#39;s pennywise vs Freddy Fazbear
As a massive king fan and as a massive fan of this book, I was quite disappointed. Andy’s direction was nothing like the one of chapter 1, it felt exaggerated, over the top, Bowers was kind of wasted in this movie. The tongue twister that billy was reciting in the first movie led to nothing in this one. Eddie and the leper man was also terrible, that scene where he vomits on him. Would’ve been a nice call back but the tone was all over the place and the music choice made it more funny than scary. Happy Mike got more the screen time tho, also was cool finding the Christine and the shining references (and Stephen king’s cameo) overall, it wrapped up well but leaves you empty, not the same emptiness that the book leaves in you (which is nostalgic and sad) but empty in the way you wish it had played out differently and smarter directing decisions were made. I watched this the day it came out, I only came to terms with it until now 4 years later lol. I will still rewatch this trailer in hope that we get another remake of IT in my lifetime.
This trailer was better then the movie imo. I mean it was pretty ok. But the power of friendship was a little weak
Hey. Arnold
Stenli
Yeah no I don&#39;t think I have anything I&#39;m actually &#39;scared&#39; of .<br><br>* Deluge dirge starts playing *<br><br><br><b>AAAAAAAAA</b>
&quot;you lied... and i died&quot;  this sentence will always give me chills
I watched the first one and it was really impressive to watch due to all the effects of it and the remake wasn’t that scary but disturbing. I gotta say, pennywise the clown reminds me of Ryuk from Death Note
i love this movie was a warm day in perris when i saw this with my friend gen we were in the thiters all alone cause movie was creepy and it was a cheep movie place but fun when i was eating popcorn and watch it all the way i really kinda fealt like it was in the house maybe it was hunted theter i do kinda bealive in ghosts but this movie we watched all the way and we injoyed each and every moment now that i look i cry sometimes cause i missed her she no longer in my heart she left me and sad how life is one day its hot and cold but i love it this is a great movie people watch its scary and injoyable
This movie was pretty bad and a total cringe-fest
Omoo this movie get better hyping, a great job is done here
It can this great movie looks so seminar to children in the first movie?

Hey, wasn&#39;t this movie 2 hours and 50 minutes long?
This film is great up until the final act which is not very good in true King fashion and I really had high expectations for it after part 1

I watched this movie in theaters. And it terrified me.😰
no bad cgi 😂

Where can I watch the second part?
VIM PELA Jessy
What a disappointment, great cast but ruined by all that stupid cgi clips.
At first i wanted to watch it to see James McAvoy but then i really enjoy the movie
Does anybody know where I can get James McAvoy checkered shirt from
They all float down here
Ronald McDonald isn’t doing so well after he got fired
This is still one of the greatest trailers of all time
What a disaster
Kind of weird how to see Bill Hader do a horror movie
This trailer is so good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=140">2:20</a> I didn’t know ishowspeed was in the movie
So, how stupid can you be as a movie producer to not cast a Beautiful Red Haired with Amazing eyes like the original ?  Beyond Stupid.
IT Chapter Two came out during my junior year of high school. This movie is awesome even though it&#39;s scary and sad.
Too much CGI... Garbage.
When the trailer is 10 times better than the movie.<br>Such a shame thr first one was really good this one sucked hard
They’d be stupid not to do a Part III. <br><br>Even if it’s a prequel, Bill Skarsgard is perfect for this role.

This ain&#39;t horror, this is action.
The amount of hype for this movie was unexplainable. I watched this in the theater with my dad and it was real disappointing, but I still ADORE Bill Hader and just the whole trailer
that one scene with Ediie and Richie at the end made me cry so bad😭
Jajaja como ponen la versión del pasado de todos, pero eran obvios quienes eran Beberly y Mike xD

I might be in the minority but I was pretty disappointed they turned <br>It Chapter 2 into a horror-comedy. 🙄 <br><br>And that kinda also applies to Chapter 1.
I really do scary horror movies😱🔆
Where can I watch it?
Goofy ah ah  broke mirror
Jessy wtf?
A Nice movie ❤️🧡💚💜💙🔥👌🏻🥰
First part of this Movie is better than this one
To this very day, this trailer still gives me goosebumps.
The two small clips of Richie reacting to Eddie’s death: barley discernible<br>Me: KJHDACIJHSACIUBSAFIJBAEDIJAnguish pain whyy howww darrreeee
I love the underlying tone which shows up in the movie which is that Bill isn&#39;t scared of Pennywise and he remembers that from when he was younger. He&#39;s just angry at him so Pennywise uses that against him when he&#39;s older. Hence showing him his brother screaming those lines (guilt tripping) and using the boy as bait so Bill can rage out. We all heard what Master Yoda said about fear and anger
The trailer is kind of weird and cool at the same time
Duskwood
L<br>😆
Got to give praise to the cast and crew for staying as true to the novel as they did given the script. While I love Chapter 1 the best, I was nonetheless amazed and pleased how the sequel was true to King&#39;s work in notable respects. The adult Losers cast did and amazing job and Bill Skarsgard&#39;s performance as Pennywise was incredible!
IM SCARED 😂<br>NICE SCARY VIDS

I hate what they did with Stanley. They should have just kept him there. It felt so incomplete without him.

im sorry but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=79">1:19</a>
Even though i liked the movie, i thought it had the same problem that pirates of the Carribbean 3 did, it was way longer than it should be, but unlike that movie, it two has great pay-offs with emotional moments that hurt, and i think it&#39;s underated!
They are missing one kid tho
Witness the end of it 9.6.19 in IMAX &amp; dolby cinema
Thank you jessy ❤😂
tbh I miss the hype for this movie
Is this McDonald&#39;s official movie? 😂
Wait, it&#39;s been 2 years already? Dang
God, this movie is boring. The original is so much better.
Jessy
Oh Jessie rights this is really scary
I figured Jessy gave off a vibe from this movie
I hate, hate, haaateee that the movie didn&#39;t live up to my expectations and let&#39;s face it. Was the worst it could be. Such a dissapointment.
Am I the only one from Jessie&#39;s link?
Why does Jessy just have this in her links-

For such a dope trailer, the sequel was such a letdown.  It just didn&#39;t have the horror/mystery and suspense as much as the first one did since it&#39;s from the perspective of their younger selves

Whoever knows gravity falls this looks like a gravity falls trailer
Sadly we will never get a horror movie like this again, so let&#39;s admire the great times we had repeating this film over and over again
This was truly one of the best trailers i have ever seen. It still gives me chills. Such a shame the movie was so bad.😭
Gotta say, Beverly developed a damn good butt chin for the past 27 years, lol
It&#39;s a pity the movie didnt have the trailer quality :(
Great freaking movie

It would be more fun if stan and eds didn&#39;t died
In 24 years we all gonna be watching another it movie
Spoiler if you haven’t read the book or seen this movie yet….<br><br><br><br><br>I know Stan dies and he&#39;s barley in the movie, but I think it&#39;s just disrespectful for him to not include his adult counterpart in the trailer. We see the transition of what the Losers look like from kids to adults at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=43">0:43</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=54">0:54</a>, but Stan isn&#39;t included. The fact that they don&#39;t show adult Stan in this trailer kinda gives it away to the audience who&#39;s never read the book or seen the miniseries that he wouldn&#39;t really be in the movie very much. While adult Stan is barley in the movie, there was still enough footage to show his face during that sequence I mentioned in the timestamp above.
Idk y but there was a link in the game duskwood which brought me here...

Pennywise Why do I dream about you 😳❤?!
Oh dude look is pennywise
Who
Oh my gosh who is that
Oh is boy is kill and it
the best bit about the movie was Isaiah Mustafa&#39;s voice and the Pennywise scenes.
3 hours of trash. did all those actors sign for a better script or just some dollar dollar?
Jessy tf
Uh ohh looks like our old freind is bigger and better
Amigo si estás aquí por duskwood gracias
E disso que jessy gosta (duskwood)
So to beat Pennywise you have to say &quot; Im NoT aFrAiD &quot; even tho they are? What a joke of a ending....
2 years later and I still can’t get over the casting is phenomenal
Of course its a comedy, don&#39;t you hear...the laughing ?
tbh this kind of scary movie will haunt me in my lifetime if i were a kids watching this. always have bad dream of this kind of clown, scare. just briliant.
Nice and cool 🤩
Its official IT has stop and seized to be a creepy clown movie. Its now just a compilation of ideas  from other movies botched to make this movie. Somewhere Stephen King is probably crying his heart out bcuz some egghead ruined his legacy.

Hi
Trailer was far better than the movie. Because, it was not scary but disgusting at some point.
I liked the original one. The first remake was ok, but this one is more disgusting than it is scary
The monsters in this movie werent scary, they were disgusting
Estou aqui por causa de Duskwood (I&#39;m here because Duskwood) 🤭
Quem veio aqui por causa da Jessy do jogo?
wow this trailer is one of my favorite damn It the best movie i think ever came out for kids does who love horror
this is better than the made for tv movie and one of the very best scary movies in a long time
What Jessica chastain movie is it referring in this?
There’s gotta be a third one like no way that was the end making him a shrivelled up baby with no heart
My only issue with Chapter 2 is that I would have made Beverly completely fearless and savage. She deserved to be the real hero in this movie as she had so much abuse her whole life. In the first movie she was the strongest.
Who remembers when this came out
John Harkey
Georgie looks too sweet to be that monster
Can’t only the kids see him??
Wow, 45mins in and it&#39;s just bad. The Hockstetter ghoul, the clown, the cgi.

the perfect trailer
Anyone here who loved the 90a version because original has it&#39;s own vibe❤
Had no idea that jessica chastain was in here
Bill Hader was unaware that Bill Skarsgård can actually move his eyes in two different directions. Hader asked Skarsgård what kind of editing was done to achieve the effect in the first movie. Skarsgård, in full costume and makeup, responded by saying &quot;Oh, you mean this?&quot; and doing it, causing Hader to freak out.
Man I wish there was a part 3.
if there will be the creeper vs pennywise that will be awesome
This movie came out on my birthday...sooo, I saw it for celebration..

Happy endings are a blessing in horror movies...<br>I loved the ending so much...❤<br><br>Any recommendations on horror movies with happy endings??
Tbh this movie isn&#39;t scary. Too much creature and special effects. It was good but it just seemed more of a fantasy movie then a scary horror movie.<br><br>Same with the first movie although that was actually built like a horror movie and was a teeny bit scarier
eminem lose yourself
So did anyone actually like it chapter 2 more than the first one?
Too bad the movie was str8 trash..

I love that movie, although I like chapter 1 more. But at least I think It chapter 2 shouldnt have got the usk 16. I think it should have got the rating 18. And not only, because CHILDREN died!

They should make IT chapter 3
To me it is not scary at all
Terrible movie.  Felt like it was directed and written by 12 year olds.
corridor digital
boys and girls. this is a REAL gud trailer
I am not gonna watch dis im gonna have nightmares whem i sleep i always have nightmares when i sleep so that&#39;s why im not watching dis i already seen it but not the chapter 2 tho-
one of the most disturbing and shocking parts of the movie was actually the beginning with the killing of adrian, which is based on a real happening; just except for the alienpart of course. but it really happened that some youngsters threw a homosexual man off the bridge who had asthma and drowned afterwards. his name was Charlie Howard
I wish the movie was as good as the trailer made it out to be
you lied and I died

Oh no...There making a IT chapter 3 Without Billskarsguard! I have to admit Billskarsguard is the best pennywise. Also i legit commented under a billskarsguard interview to ask if they can make a IT chapter 3 where when richie dies they will get a chance to go back and warn there friends, Then again that wouldnt be that bloody. Comment down below what u think.
I don&#39;t know why my mind keeps saying &quot;Beverage&quot; instead of &quot;Beverly&quot; LOL 😂

Too much story for a rushed 2 movie franchise. If it was a limited series they wouldn’t rely on  cheap jump scares. Going deeper in the story of Pennywise would have been way scarier.

he do be lookin kinda fresh doe
I&#39;ve seen all the it&#39;s the original and both the remake and this one and they are all good
hey anyone&#39;s please tag me a great horror film 🙏❤️
pikasprey
Wow... this movie is just embarrassing. and to think i was actually looking forward to it and believed it would actually hold up. it gets rid of the subtle scare style of the first one that builds up and treats the viewer like actual adult viewers and replaces it with cheap CG jump scares that turn every scene into a laughing stock that only a 4 year old would be afraid of.
Movie was a mess. All the running around, lost its own plot. The book ending was more heroic, like Chapter 1. You end up with a generic monster movie, with references to other movies to make it more jazz hands.
The movie:  <b>pennywise rises from 27 years</b><br><br>The losers: umm well u think ur so strong umm well, u small!!!<br><br>Pennywise: <b>dramatically falls and turns to a baby clown</b><br><br>The losers: well he&#39;s dramatic.. 😒.. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>NOW LETS PARTY!!
Someone else is seeing this after the movie or is just me?
YALL THIS IS JUST THE TRAILER IMAGINE THE MOVIE
🔥
Love it😍
As far as horror movie trailers go this is just fantastic whether you liked the actual movie or not. IT Chapter 2 get&#39;s allot of shit for it&#39;s pacing and sometimes out of place humor but I would argue it&#39;s still fairly enjoyable especially if you binge watch both movies back to back.

2020?
This is not scary at all but I found it a good funny Film
I don&#39;t know how people can complain about this movie... I reckon it was great!👍
Thought the first movie was a great remake from the first one. Chapter two was okay. Stephen King is a good writer
This technically happens in 2016.
This trailer...This Movie ❤
It’d a no from me 💅🏼
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=134">2:14</a> that part never happened in the movie right or is just me¿?
I don’t see why people hated this so much it wasn’t as good as the first but I still enjoyed it
The trailer made the movie seem like it was gonna be one of the best horror movie sequels of all time

This gave me nightmares im bloody 35!

If they hadn’t done the weird cgi on the kids’ faces, this would have been a better movie. That cgi just took me out of every flashback scene.
All I can say about this movie is CGI is the next best thing to slice bread. If you wanna make a horror movie try making one up and stop  Ruining the classics!!

Stephen King knows how to make us all depressed little shits
Most overrated film ever
Awesome trailer
Atho

The trailer was better than  movie

Yes the first chapter is definitely better than the second chapter but chapter 2 is still good imo.

Hi

What’s the name of the track they used for this?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=138">2:18</a> when you try to scare your friends pretending to be penny wise but your makeup falls off because ur sweating so much.
Só eu que voltei aqui por causa de um jogo de desaparecimento?;-----;
But it says IT comes every 100 years
SO I will say trailer is amazing but the movie was not even scary. Not a lot of death in it as I thought but I still prefer the first one
Gives me chills
Damn, this trailer is freaking epic.
here because of Jessy Hawkins
Maybe Eddie will be The Next pennywise in Chapter 3 o.O
The movie was good but the trailer was even more epic
That’s be so creepy to be stuck in the hall of mirrors with that thing
I going to tell my kids that pennywise is Ronald McDonald so that they would stop bying McDonald food hehe
Billy was more  handsome when he was a kid 😅🤭I like him
Wanne kut film dit
Unpopular opinion, I preferred this to the first one.
How do they look like their childhood size
Just watched this. Absolute garbage.  Way too long, stupid and boring.
This was worse than the first one so all you have to do is insult him and  his ugly ass would turn  little , this is the worst almost 3-hour movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my life... Pennywise is basically a pedophile something Steven king knows a lot about That&#39;s why you see it in his movies and all these kids grew up successful lives and they go back cuz they promised to go back if appeared again he should have gave the money he paid to make this bullshit  to me, whoever went to the movies spent money to see this is a pedophile this movie was bullshit I don&#39;t even know why I watched it cuz I hated the first one also, . .. I almost cut this movie off it was so trash if you like this movie you are a pedophile also only pedophiles like these type of movies... 4/10 for me... Anyway I thought Stephen King was dead his ugly ass still alive... I didn&#39;t even know he made the movie until I seen him in it ugly azz shit...
This part sucks
Chapter 3 prequel
the last time i felt actual happiness is when this trailer released
This film was&#39;nt the slightest bit scary.I still liked it though.

this movie was so bad
One year ago
panny wise creepy i love this move i think this was one of my favorite movies ever i never knew it could be that good i was shoked in teaters and generaly they made a good movie
I used to watch this on repeat before the movie came out
Movie was so depressing I have to self isolate for 10 years.  🌟😥
it’s been a year :(
One year ago 🥺
Pennywise the pedophile
just thinking about how crazy it is that this trailer came out a year ago today...crazy.
I cant be the only one who thinks this is a shit ending
That scene in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=134">2:14</a> is not in the movie, and I don’t know why.
I know I am late, but I am wondering...<br><br>This whole 27 years of his disappearance after the teens (now adults) thought they had finished him,<br><br>that Penny wise has been spending his life savings on Balloons? in the past 27 years (movietime)?<br><br>Lol
So like, is it worth watching?
Why does Georgie looks like FaZe h1sky
Pennywise is basically trolling them but in a really terrifying way
Man was this film dissapointing smh
Pennywise: I m back!<br><br><br>Zachary smith: Oh Bitch Not the fuck you again Oh No!<br><br>(He made video about if I was in it movie 1)
This trailer is a million times better than this movie
I just can&#39;t believe that pennywise is back
uhh yea im never watching this
For some reason I think that the movie is not as scary as the trailer 😅
I watched this with my parents last night Im fricken creeped out....
My god this movie was terrible. When will movie makers realise cgi just isn&#39;t scary.
Actually Prefer Chapter 2 👍
Quite possibly the worst film i&#39;ve ever seem, an absolute pile of cow dung
Bryce Howard looks too old. she looks younger than the adult Ben. lol.
Wowwwwwwwww 😱😱😱😱
Bad movie
alguém pelo Duskwood?
Fantastic movie
Super Trailing Direction

I remember being so hyped for this movie
Thanks for 1k likes

<b>I remember waiting for this for months and going to see it with my best friend.  Great times before the pandemic</b> 🌟
Pennywise vs COVID 19 I rather die of Pennywise
Below expectation 🙄🙄🙄
I watched It and it was amazing.
It: flies with balloons <br>Kid: Look it’s Mary Poppins
i just want to be as happy as i was when this trailer dropped
WHAT DOES IT WANT!?
No matter what this movie should be a series for some reason
Save georgie bill SAVE him
I just realized that there are two scenes in this trailer that weren&#39;t in the movie... 💔
will this be the last IT
I used to be scared of It but am not afraid anymore it little scary😌
Just got around to watching Chapter 2.Took me so long because I was so disappointed in part one.<br>Have to say Chapter 2 was no better than the 1st.<br>Bill Skarsgard&#39;s portrayal  as Pennywise was just plain awful.Tim Curry was much better.<br>Waste of time and a major let down.<br>After watching this I re watched the original,much better than this piece of crap.
the it movies are so good bc they are equally funny and scary
SELAM YIKIK 2020 YKS TAYFA
The trailer was better than the movie, also please tell me I&#39;m not the only one who jams tf out to the last 30 seconds of the trailer?
It trailer was scarier
<i>_YEEST_</i>
Me trying to laugh so I don’t get scared ............. nope I’m still scared 🙊😰
florida georgia line
Awesome movie for me.
It pains me that the second was so utterly botched. Missing detail all over the place, tonal fucking mess, terrible ending imagining of the spider / ritual.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=132">2:12</a>
We can’t let it happen again.<br>2 years later<br>IT CHAPTER 3 OUT NOW
Pennywise tried to pull me
quem mais veio por causa de DusckWood ?
The final scene in this trailer is scary!!!<br><br>Pennywise - &quot;Wohhh ohh&quot;<br>😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can’t with these comments-
It&#39;s a shame that a dope trailer like this hyped me up for such a shit movie.
Just watched the second film for a third time. It really is about the adults coming to terms with their demons. And somewhere in there is an evil clown playing tricks. If you want the scares and the horror, rely on Chapter 1. If you want closure and a life affirming message, turn to Chapter 2. In my opinion, each film perfectly captured their respective parts of the book. Job Well Done.
We need a part 3 😭
MAN I wish the movie had delivered on this trailer.
Its two different acters for the losers club
At least it isn’t as scary as the cat movie trailer
Well Spoiler Folks:Trashmouth is still Trashmouth😆
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=106">1:46</a> insert Monokuma laughter
this movie gave me depression
Another great adaptation, but again, they just can&#39;t seem to get that final kill scene right in my opinion.
As a horror movie it failed but as a fantasy-drama it’s amazing. Also a an amazing adaption of the second half of the book
I just realized that stanley isnt here i- its only his hand in blood-
I came across the video through duskwood crime thriller and detective investigative games     IS HERE HANNAH?!😂
Long Before X-Men, there was the loser club
Georgie:you lied i died <br>Me:ummmm your crazy like you talking to a clown thats not me idc if i said i was sick like boyyy you died still
Actually I liked It chap 1 as the kids were so cute 🥰 and one like for bill
YOU LIED AND I DIED
Me in front of grandma: &quot;I CUSSED AND I DIED&quot;
No one:<br><br>Girls on snapchat: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=79">1:19</a>
Im actually pissed that they let me down. In trailer Beverly and Bill seem together, they have a kiss , but then in the end of movie this bitch ben show up and I feel sad. Sorry for Benverly shippers but that is how I feel. <br>team Bilverly
Kids nowadays:O K B O O M E R
Hannah,  where are you?
Not scary
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA&amp;t=120">2:00</a> the hurt in Georgie&#39;s voice hurts me
poor Bill Scarsgard,he has nightmares of him and IT,imagine being dead in that dream with IT
Real friendship and scary and sadness ossom movie <br>My favorite character bill
When is the it super cut coming
You gotta give it to him he tries to find his kud eventhough theres a clown tryna kill him
the worst movie ever!
Wait i thought i wasnt watching the scariest movie trailer
You lied and I died
1st chapter was awesome if we compare  to second part ... I literally got bored watching second part . Just a wastage of time and internet data .
The ending is what happens when u find clown paint  and want to terrify ur sister
Vim aqui através de um jogo e não entendi nada mas tudo bem esse filme parece ótimo.
Another clown movie. Human race is retarded.
Did anyone ever realizes that in this movie shows Ben’s flashback of being attacked by Pennywise at school. But Ben finds out about Pennywise on the last day of school in the first movie.
