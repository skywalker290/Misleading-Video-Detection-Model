How can our likes and dislikes be so similar?💀 Everything is matching except one,🗿 has Sushant&#39;s spirit come inside me?😅😅
God bless his soul ❤

Just watch this after trs
Sushant ka ghar sabse sunder, dusron ke ghar bade hain mehnge hain, leking sushant ke ghar par sushant ke beshkimti yadien hongi. RiP bro
Heyyyy man come back 🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭plsssss🙏🙏🙏🙏
Amazing ❤👏
Now owner of this flat is &quot;Adah Sharma&quot;
His house is looking very beautiful
missed you forever ❤hope you are watching us we all love you. Jo nahi krna woh😂 jaa ke apni bhays charaye 😂😂
He is so dull and boring.
He was one of the finest actors in Indian cinema. Remembering him with lots of lovve. Who is watching in 2024?
He is a genius and on another level altogether ! No wonder the nepo mafia cudnt stand him!
Did he ultimately sell this house and move into the flat where he got murdered?
Existing is so easy when I think I can be around you shushant, why the hell I have to think about this murder and inspection who killed you ? Why can’t I normally exist just ?
SSR Smart Sensitive Researcher ❤<br>Highly intelligent and his home reflected his personality
❤
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice">#Justice</a> for SSR
If things were like 90s....he wld have stood next to srk..coz he has a vibe like dat..but nepotism has taken over bollywood
Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication 🌼
Can someone make out the books in his shelf ?
Умница! Как жаль, что тебя нет с  нами, Сушант!!!😢
❤
House is absolutely beautiful but there is no positive energy.<br>Its not good for mind.<br>Its like an art gallery
So down to earth..so lovely humble… like to see more of you…miss you ❤️🙏🏾🫶🏽
Is this Mont Blanc ?
2020😢
3 year later again here to see his smile and sparkle eyes. To hear his voice😭
Nothing just love ♥️✨
He is still my fav .
This property is not just a property and means a lot to those who brought it hope who even think to buy it first go and check papers for last 10people who came their for same purpose and hope then can understand to step in that apparent or not take ur own risk no super power can help any other...this place the stuff kept their r still in that place not in Patna....it belongs to real person not a fake person so keep ur paper safe to face jurisdiction which will be filled if some fake person try to sell this property Court case is still open and and is going somewhere and for a proof anyone can see how some comments get highlighted and someone liked ur comments comes hiding name of who is liking those comments...case is more twisted and no one will be left who have planned all these stuff he was not a next to door man and things r coming out soon not in that way someone had dreamt of its stranger then friction...I gave open comment open opinion on this case and waiting for justice....let&#39;s see how dare to go their
Every middle class boy is sushant singh rajput ❤
If one noticed picture wall here don&#39;t have any pics of that family from Rajeev Nagar Patna,they were never his real family not from DNA too... mysterious stories they keep plotting along with threating people who knows their reality along with unfair means a educated person can&#39;t say this even I am a engineer so never believed anyone can do this to hide their reality and take max advantage from those who were working for some purpose everyone by now must be knowing what big changes will be coming ahead in21centrury and for that very purpose everyone is involved in their respective fields and will be working in their respective fields and along that wait too to see what is coming from here Shushant Singh was not just a next door man and he will get justice too
Please notice that this is not a pant house where he found during that 14june day ..if everyone noticed what in movie nyaay is shown that flat is of two floors which is quite different from this flat and also that picture from where ambulance is going out to hospital is different building that was shoot by republic news channel from our side only anyone can figure out ....what they r portrayed is fake reality is stranger then one can think ....news said he lived in this flat from 2018-2019 and videos of YouTube channel Shows he lived their from 8yrs. . which side can be right hope people can ask their soul to get ans ..what is going inside this matter,if such cases are left unentertained just think what will be future of other blooming stars of this planet....we many out here have star dust in their DNA which is special so please don&#39;t forget ur DNA and try to understand reality
They knew he was going to rule bollywood soon that&#39;s why they killed him
♥
He was educated good kind  from good family. God will give sure justice....
miss you sir
I really miss him ❤😢
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZNl3SPbTXY">https://youtu.be/nZNl3SPbTXY</a>
Hariyali 🌴🌴<br>🍀🌿
The gem<br>Still I can&#39;t get over his death.  Mysteries r making us insane. <br>It&#39;s very personal to know why he was killed, what happened wid this kind human... 💔
Entire bollywood n the cabal is trying to cover up his murder..we have hopes from Modi ji..This golden sould needs justice..no matter how big these perpetrators are, India needs to change..he wanted to tell it all to mainstream media, little did he know they are all the channels of some netas..do not trust mainstream media..trust only youtube..
1bhk
Justice for SSR ❤
❤
Is this the same house where he took his last breath?
Does anyone know what is the book name that Sushant is showing us please.
Guys 14 June is coming 😢😭
He was a gem.

Today is 1,067th day without you Sush 💔

we miss you ssr
Oh excellent idea. Sushant is our hero. How many times I am remembering him. No answer.
Great mens never live too long. He was the biggest star in the Galaxy of the greats.
He should have  stayed here but destiny
never let that kid die in you.
If I ever feel low then I switch to this video where I actually earn knowledge patience and many more things. ❤
If you remember me ,then I don’t care if everyone else forgets-kafka on the shore
I will forever remember you like this happy angel🥺🤍
RIP Sushant Sir &amp; Fudge😢
SSR to chla gya, jo log iska naam kharab kiye aur ise nashedi, druggist bole jisme RC, AB, RPS, KA, AK, VD, SK, etc ye sb the, aaj max sb Bollywood k top level k actors bn gye. Matlab ye clear h, aaj k time achai ki jeet hona impossible h aur intelligence/talent k liye koi jagah nhi h.
Sushat singh rajpot eis best
তুই না মারা গেছোস? মরোস নাই?
Such a gem,  rest in peace
If he not listened to tat chudail Rhea Chakraborty then he wud have been alive now.

Miss you
Comback sushant sir 😭😭😭😭 plz god do magic plz
Sushant Singh Rajput was capable of single handedly relaunching the Bollywood universe. Cause he had some guts also he was an inspiration for all. After SRK the upcoming king of bollywood was SSR. But this nepotism &amp; star kid doesn&#39;t help him survive🥺. RIP SSR🥀❤️

Coming back again to hear your beautiful voice. Oh how I wish I could turn back time. You are LOVE ❤️
Miss Rhea felt that there are ghosts in this beautiful house n made him shift from this heartfelt house of his that he made with so much love,passion to that actual ghostly mont Blanc
He is (not was) very humble and peace man
May his soul rest in peace 🥺♥️
Love from Pakistan ssr 💘
Love for him🙈🫶
Miss you hero
Cogito ergo sum, brilliant ❤️
His beautiful house is a projection of his beautiful soul ❤ very interesting &amp; charming personality. I still don&#39;t understand what made this intelligent, knowledgeable young man fall for a cunning, brainless, ruthless, evil woman like Rhea.
We miss him truly ❤️

Hi Asian paint please the apartment ment name
Where is the apartment
Please tell the apartment name
a star lost so early, watching this in 2022
Such a multitalented person he was...Each corner is full of something special..He is Unique
This video was posted when was my birthday 😭😭please god give back this pure soul it,s needed on the Earth 😭
I can see Descartes in your house Sushant &lt;3 You know I love you so .<br>Also if anyone wants  to have an empirical experience as to where is Descartes, then go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbkiZE8xqBc&amp;t=70">1:10</a><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23loveyous">#loveyouS</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23connectedforever">#connectedforever</a>

what a cutie!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbkiZE8xqBc&amp;t=225">3:45</a> he wanted to be a pilot and that w!tch Rhea was claiming that he had axiety sitting in a plane.. he was so handsome and intelligent, Bullywood k!lled him. They all will pay for it.
🙏Miss You SSR🙏
Every time I see his photos/videos I feel a deep hurt in my heart even though I did not know him...it was brutal...the culprits will rot in hell...justice will prevail!
Where ever you . God is always with you .,.... from NAGA  india
Miss you 💜
Every time I see this I cry. Miss u SSR
We miss you . You had so many dreams . It’s sad the way you died . You will get justice .we will pray that u will get justice
His home, taste, style, class and its character are just extraordinaire!Our Sushant Singh Rajput doesn&#39;t do NORMAL!❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 praying for your safe return.
आप केवल एक अच्छे हीरो नहीं थे बल्कि अच्छे साइंटिस्ट भी थे यही वजह है की आपके जाने की कमी ज्यादा खल रही है... नेपोटिस्म का स्वाहा करेंगे सब
मैंने फिल्म्स ही देखना छोड़ दिया सुशांत के जाने के बाद,जब कोई दुःख में काम नहीं आ सकते तो हम उन टुच्चो की फ़िल्म्स देखकर अपना टाइम क्यों ख़राब करें
You will always be missed Sushant❤❤❤❤
Was missing your smile and the innocence of it so came back to watch this  interview  again...so down to earth and humble person... Bollywood  will pay heavily for snubbing your life..
Even Modi govt. couldn&#39;t bring justice to Sushant.<br><br>I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever get to know the extent of how powerful Bollywood is.<br><br>I feel irate that this case has been treated the way it was.<br><br>No matter how depressed a successful younger actor becomes at some point, there&#39;s no way he will kill himself and leave everything behind.<br><br>This guy was killed and even a powerful PM like Modi could not do jack about it.
His house is a reflection of his intelligent minded humble style and story follows every room every corner brings a story of greatness from no other then Sushant can bring a very talented young man with a smile of sureness and full of life positive attitude towards life. Crushed in his prime by evil and corrupt Bollywood INDIVIDUALs who MURDERED HIM JUSTICE FOR SSR MUST PREVAIL A FAN ALWAYS ❤😘
Rest in peace legend 🙏
Miss u sir..😥
After watching this... I just can&#39;t believe he is no more...
i just keep coming back to this video..watching him in his most original and raw nature, in his home among his favourite things. i&#39;m not gonna lie and say that i have always been his fan but he was always underrated for sure. he was a smart, talented and beautiful person and i miss him.
Why God why?? <br>I will always love you sushant
Brilliant guy 🙏🏼🙏🏼😭
A thinking room, all those books to read and a wise outlook to life. Sushant wasn&#39;t the type to commit suicide... May his soul rest in peace and May God reveal the truth to the world
Brilliant young man
Dear sushant we all love you son want to say a lot but speech less don&#39;t hv words.... you Change many lives

He deserved happiness. Heart breaks when you see this. Those responsible for what happened to him will never live in peace.
Always he wanted to be an astronaut.
More than a year and still can&#39;t believe he&#39;s not with us. This world don&#39;t deserve you. Maybe you have gone to a better world❤️
Whoever killed him will suffer.
True genius
I was like your house and all everything my favorites are you sushant Singh rajput
Nice home sushant Singh rajput
😔😒😒
What&#39;s there to dislike in his house? it&#39;s a question to all those who disliked his house.
His only true fans were who commented good about him before his death, I see mostly 1 year old comments edited <br>Just to show sympathy for him, hypocrites,
I love this video ❤

හොද වැඩක් ...❤
Susant sir is the very intelligent and good boy
😭😭
Of all the celeb house tours I have seen, Sushant&#39;s is one of my favourites. Classy and luxuriant enough to look like a celebrity abode and yet simple enough to look like a home and not musuem. Mallika Dua&#39;s apartment and Kabir Khan&#39;s house were nice too.
Justice for ssr sir I Miss you
Justice for sushant singh and disha jiya Sid dharth Miss you SSR Siddharth shukla ji 🙏🏼
Kaha tum chle gye😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Sushi&quot;s eyes are speaking the truth, his inner qualities and his dreams - so lovely catchy eyes indeed!
He had such a soft, calm spirit.....he definitely had characteristics of an old soul. He was much bigger and better than Bollywood.  His intellect and interests alone show how great of a man he was. Breaks my heart he is no more, but it&#39;s clear to see that his memory lives on in the hearts of those he&#39;s left behind 🙏
Legends watching in September 2021
being his ardent fan after seeing all types of stories..i can say only may god bless his soul..rip sir..&amp; just a question..bhai why did you do this?....
He was Emotional at this time he was having tears in his eyes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbkiZE8xqBc&amp;t=338">5:38</a>
he had such a beautiful home! why did he even have to move to that satanic place
How many noticed a board tht said&quot; I don&#39;t do normal&quot; on top of his bookshelf
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbkiZE8xqBc&amp;t=166">2:46</a>...😭😭😭😭...
Koi nahin bachega<br>Jaisi karni waisi bharni
Hey God<br>Koi to hona chahie tha use bachane ke liye
Miss him yaar...
❤️💯
Sushant should have become an astronaut or an engineer... Bollywood is full of nepotism nowadays..
Sad but The good die young
We Love you Sushant

I watched this video when he was alive. It&#39;s hard/ unbelievable to watch it now. I wish his family gets the closure they need.
This video makes me cry i can&#39;t control myself cause he put many effort to make his dream house and murderers just destroy everything in one night. 😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪How could they do that. Justic for Sushant Singh Rajput
Miss you Sushant!!!😢😓😥<br><br>SSR
He always want to do everything
he is such a intellegent guy  and a creative thinker his ideology everthing is awesome <br>i think by seeing all this   i ca say <br>its not suicide but a sacrifice <br>because before his death nepotism was at peaks they havent given chances to the talented actors<br>if a outsiders got a role if the role was too good then it will taken away by producers and given to star kids <br>even he got many fantastic role as hero but taken away bec he has no backround and too talented<br><br>so he wanted a change but he cant fight alone and if any body support him their carier would be end<br>so he might thought  sacrifise of himself would make  a stop for nepotism and he can be helpful for ousiders <br><br>now we all can see  that so many talented actors recognised by people still not got chances but still people got  to know about the situation of bollywood productions <br><br>love you  sushanth sir

Miss u SSR.
I guess correctly all his answers at the end
I wish and pray that both SSR are Disha Salian get justice. Ban and boycott druggie bollywood forever
People in his life collectively killed him. Collectively drugged, honey trapped and killed a magical marvelous man who knew nothing but to dream and make it big.

No one can think that a man who lives among so many books and so many dreams can be so lonely 😓 <br>Guys it&#39;s a big loss yaar 😢😢😢
He was so naive. No show off, so simple. His simplicity and innocence shows how he was trapped and was made to shift from this house.
Intelligent &amp; Beautiful

Misss u alot bro...
Rip sushant love lots of love I never ever forget you
Wish just had more courage to face that day....
How talented you were!!! Master in every field!! You were an unique soul. A unique gentle man hard to find these days.... You were as transparent as water, as innocent as a child and as loving as a flower.... I don&#39;t know how to express my grief.... It&#39;s almost 1 year to loose you, but even today also I can&#39;t believe that you passed away... How unnatural things happen..! <br>Aapka character esa tha ki apke upar jitna tareef kare, utna kaam hai 💞💞<br>Idk why but still we feel that you are here with us....!! And yes ik you are there somewhere, watching your fans to cry for you, to fight for your justice....!! <br>The world has been very cruel to you, bolte hai na ki having a kind heart is a crime nowadays.... The same happened with you 😞 you were so kind and innocent that you never understood what your so called &#39;friends&#39; were planning against you.... They thought to kill you!!!! <br>How criminal they are!!! <br><br>Anyway <br><br>Be happy wherever you are <br>We, your fans love you a lot!!! <br>You were incredible 💜<br>And even now you are an inspiration to many of us <br><br>-- A fan of yours 💖
Love you Sushant Sar

Miss him sooo much, can&#39;t explain in words😥😭😭😭
Why he moved out of this beautiful house and started living in a rented house by paying 4.5 lakh month???

🙏
How creative and intelligent minded person was S.S.R<br>It clearly shows that he was murdererd<br>But some disgusting criminal tries to prove it as murder &amp; fools will believe those criminal&#39;s

Your Life compels people to rethink about the importance of having Dreams,  Humanity,  Innocence and Pureheartedness in Human Life......SSR You are indeed a Great Soul..😊🙏
You literally need to have a very vast thinking and beyond imagination thinking to understand his talks❤HE IS A PERSON THIS WHOLE WORLD WILL NEVER GET AGAIN🥺🔱👑🦋♾
This Bollywood snatched Fudge&#39;s Hooman from him🥺❤CAN&#39;T IMAGINE HOW FUDGE IS LIVING RN!🔱🥺♾

Really sad to see him no more😓
I never find young man like ssr....pious man...
Naked I have come naked I will leave this world

Hi This is Sushant Singh Rajput you are watching Asian paints where the heart is like kare
&quot;Hi, this is Sushant Singh Rajput.&quot;<br><br>When will you say this again?
He is beautiful he said k star ptani bante kaise hai but now he is a superstar 😍🤩🥰❤⭐🌠
Sushant sir bhaut mast ha ghar app ka app ne society ku kya khud ko
Let&#39;s raise your voices towards result of case but it is going some way seriously it&#39;s wrong  how can you do is guys he is such a nice guy...
And Rhea claimed this home haunted...
I have great respect for u 🇮🇳🙏🙏🙏
Sushant Sir You are very Talented,Handsome and Intelligent    <br>Sir You are not die you are in our Hearts Forever
His home is a replica of him and his ideas, mindset. His love for stargazing is so evident by seeing the telescope. Look at the 20 rupees note he framed on the wall which he got from Rajkumar Hirani for PK. The variety of books, the love for his pet dog Fudge, the passion for world cinema, the junkyard DIY things, the love for astronomy and quantum physics makes him out of this world. His energy is surely resonating with all SSRians and we are cherishing you forever. ❤️
My favorite actor
To the people who supported and loved Sushant before his death👇👇<br>I&#39;m literally so proud of you guys. Among this huge industry, ruled by nepotism, you guys managed to love and support a real talent❤. <br><br>I had watched Kedarnath and Chicchorre before his death but was not such a big fan. I just liked this guy and thought he was cool, that&#39;s all.<br><br> But before his unfortunate death, I never realized that my feelings could deepen so much for this man. His death has left me in such a shock, that even after 3 months, I can&#39;t get over this horrible incident. With each passing day, my heart bleeds more for him and I&#39;m always thinking about him. I can&#39;t concentrate in anything. I know he&#39;s alive in our hearts, but that doesn&#39;t give me relief. I want to bring him back at any cost😭😭😭😭😭.
Miss You Sushant.....
An amazing-class person without being classy<br>Very touched to ground...<br>Love You Gulshan&#39;SSR&#39;;)<br>Forever Yours and you forever Ours 💗
I always miss you so much 😭😭 you should always leave in my mind 🙏🙏 RIP dearest Sushant Singh Rajput
Justice for SSR 😭😭😭😭😭

Can anyone pls tell me the colour shades of his sofa room
May be we can see Sushant through his telescope as a shining star, out from the crowd, most close to  God.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbkiZE8xqBc&amp;t=197">3:17</a> his innocent smile 😭😭😭😭😭 SSR please come back
What a beautiful beautiful soul inside and out❤️❤️❤️ one of the genius and Krishna of today’s yuga
he is so cute😍😍😍
what is the location and name of this flat? i dont think it is mount blanc...please tell if anyone knows about it
Sometimes his voice sounds exactly like SRK...
Total loss, SSR &#39;s death has been buried. It&#39;s only the drug racket and now Kangna also disappeared. CBI has also not been able to do anything. Where&#39;s sandeep Singh and pathani? Why aren&#39;t they being grilled? It&#39;s all a big joke like all the other mysterious so called suicides. Shame on the judiciary of India.
Thank  you shushant  for teaching  us <br>How to live life<br>How to  dream <br>You are  a very good human being<br>Kind person and Beautiful. <br>I don&#39;t know  you personally <br>But still missing  you like my family  member  bro.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justicshushantsinghrajput">#justicshushantsinghrajput</a>

Sushant singh rajput come back please 😭😢
After studying this man all other bollywood actors look like jokers to me
This video itself shows he has been MURDERED. He can never ever commit suicide.
This house is old one or new rented one of bandra
He didn&#39;t even show his kitchen or bedroom. Sleep and he were miles apart. Such was his dedication and passion.
Mera pyara shushant
His house is amazing like them
😥
Is this capri heights?
When He was safe at home 💔💔💔
THE ONLY BACHELOR WHO&#39;S HOUSE IS NEAT AND CLEAN,😂🤣😃🙂😏😣😢
World&#39;s youngest role model for everytime
He talks about the Interior designer with whom he created this beautiful home . Or that is what I thought I heard.  Does anyone know the name of the person?

Oh` Sushant, na jaane kon si wo ghari thi jo tumhe hamesha ke liye dur kar diya? It&#39;s been almost three months now since you departed. Your untimely death shook the entire world by non stop of storms. So much to see in life, so young in age, everything was snatched away. I couldn&#39;t watch this in complete. I just couldn&#39;t. The sadness is much to bear. Joining the trending hashtags,, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#justiceforssr</a>,, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ssrians">#ssrians</a>,, is apart of the support I could show from across the seven seas. I&#39;ll always remember you in my prayers. Rip handsome 🥺💔
Who is here for susant in sept month like it.
Tum yahi ho mere babu
He was shifted from beautiful home to the other house , where murdered brutally 😒😪
I miss you Sushant, so much 😥
Itne acche insan ko maar diye yr 😢
❤️
Kadi se kadi saja milni chahiea mout se battar life honi chahiea request for you God we want justice
Kaash k tum kahin se ajao😔😔😔
Saw the video many times before he died.  Such a genuine and lovely person. Was this the haunted house from where he shifted to the rented apartment at bandra?

But I&#39;m pretty drowned the way R.Bharat is behaving. They&#39;ve takin the entire focus. Cos&#39; of their TRP&#39;S.

Justice for ssr
Ju
जैसे जैसे मैं यह विडियो देख रही थी मेरा दिल कह रहा था सुशांत पूरा घर दिखाना लेकिन अपना बेडरूम नहीं......कितने प्यार से एक एक चीज़ इकट्ठा कर के यह घर सजाया है,आज इस घर की हर चीज़ बेची या फेंकी जा चुकी है,तुम्हारे जीते जी हमें क्यूं न मालूम चल सका कि तुम इतने अलग हो अन्य कलाकारों से।
We miss you Sushant Sir 😭
Sush you were such a genius bro we lost a gem a true diamond😭😭😭😭😢😢
Reha made Sushant move out of this beautiful home, into that unfortunate apartment where Sushant eventually died.<br>She needs to be sent to jail as soon as possible.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnENclMQ5OE">https://youtu.be/UnENclMQ5OE</a> kya sochte the susant
Is this the house he breathed his last?
The best person I ever seen in my life.... Love u sir..
I didn&#39;t even know you sushant...but tere Jane se aisa laga ki koi pyara dost kho diya 😭😢
U r amezing Sushant 👌<br>Ur house is a dream house 👌<br>Bahut Achi Achi cheeje hai ghr pr<br>That&#39;s why u r best one in the whole world ❤️💞😘
Wow  do nice
Us bhootni Rhea ne saara vaastu change kiya hoga🤔
I have watched this multiple times nd everytime it feels like new to watch. Love to watch it over and over.
Pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbkiZE8xqBc&amp;t=121">2:01</a>. He has a book named &quot;Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Tensorflow&quot;. <br>I knew he was learning game development but he was learning machine learning also. Wow.
Please upload more of his house🙏🏼
RIP brother, &quot;I tell all about when I see u again&quot; Wiz khalifa. I am sure u will master the other side as well.
Was SSR killed in this particular house??
His massive mistake was taking and allowing rhea in his house. Now he and his house are destroyed by her. Missing him and feeling pity for him that he lost his life and never will be able to back in this world it’s heartbreaking....
Anyone comes here to see him again and again when you miss him?
Sushant was a gem of a person. Even God loves good people.  Ultimately we want <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#JusticeForSSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#JusticeForSSR</a>.

Ap sab kese fans ho? Jab usse apki sabse jyada jurat thi, I mean jab sushant ka <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#metoo</a> main name aya tha tab kisne as a fan support nhi kiya ab jab voh nhi rha toh kyu ldh rhe hao?
A person of such nature would never commit suicide.. there is not a single person in entire Bollywood gang who will match to his intellectual.. big celebrities must be insecure of his success and would definitely have planned to get rid of him..
He is intelligent boy he should should not take step with life
He wanted to be pilot😢
God bless you beautiful Soul! Justice shall prevail. Perpetrators will be punished.
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbkiZE8xqBc&amp;t=245">04:05</a> sparkling eyes full of life and dreams, innocent smile full of love and happiness
He is murdered not suicide.......sushant lovers hit like
Love you SHUSHANT ❤
Ssr has not left us<br>He is within us inspiring every moment
Susant was amazing and people should say that
Isme unlike karne ki konsi bat hai
You are great sushant singh rajput💓
I want a film production company and music label named after SSR:<br><br>1. SSR Productions<br>2. SSR Music Company
His collection of book makes me respect him even more because they are all about growth in life and in the mind,intelligence,About the human , about learning about the facts ,as well ..... Not some fiction book or anything like that
love you sush❤️ we are close to get justice darling 🙏🏼  I cry everytime I see you or think about you ..you left us with so much pain and regrets, may be this is what we all deserved..
im done with bollywood. DONE. OVER &amp; out.
Love you sush always ♥

Ankita loved him unconditionally... we miss u our real hero....<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#justice4ssr</a> 💔😔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbkiZE8xqBc&amp;t=140">2:20</a>.<br><br><br>SSR used to say that his telescope is his time machine . Why ! Because it is Sci  Fact that when you look stars in sky you actually not seeing anything in real time but you are seeing   events of past according to its Distance from you . <br>It&#39;s the Science of Physics<br> This is How ..<br>The fact is<br>1. We see anything when light from any source reflect from the object and reach to your eyes which you wanna see , or something time that object is the source of light itself like ligh bulb , torch or sun.<br>2. Any or every Light travels at fix speed 299,792 kilometers per second. <br>So if you are seeing moon which is around  3laks km(nearly same as light speed in space) far from earth , you are actually seeing moon of 1 one second earlier. same true for sun but sun is extremely far from us (≈ 151MKM ) so every Time  we see sun we are actually seeing sun of  8 minutes earlier same for other stars ( which is just like far sun ) but because stars are so far from us from 4 to 2000 Light years  in our Galaxy ( 1 light years = 94610000.....12zeros....KM in distance it&#39;s so long )  <br>  So when ever you see star named Alpha centauri which is closest star from earth (4 light Years in distance ) you are actually seeing 4 years back in Time Because light takes 4 years to go that far.<br>It&#39;s not just abut light but also about Real Time because Nothing can go Faster than Light in the universe , it&#39;s Impossible according to Physics  If  somehow anything goes faster then light speed , it will just go back in  Time.
It&#39;s nice to see  &quot;Cogito Ergo Sum&quot; , the philosophical statement of René Descartes on his wall.
He is the biggest loss of our era. What a shame.
we miss you sushant sir..❤😭😭
RIP
This video is one of the video closest to my heart and Sushant&#39; heart. We get to see him vulnerable , loving his dog , talking with dreamy eyes about all his passion , showing it to the world and spreading the knowledge which he is best at doing. I am grateful now that this video is made. I hope SSR is Alive.
What kind of a controlling Narcissist Sociopath partner can one be that she made Sushant change his beautiful house.
I am so grateful this is made.
This house was good for him. He thrived here till Rhea made him move.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbkiZE8xqBc&amp;t=294">4:54</a> I have noticed that the bird just fallen into the coffee mug what a coincidence 😄😄 .
Stop saying this he never died.... nothing happened on 14th June. He is still here along with us. He is alive 😭😭😭😭❤️
MC
This house shows what an extraordinary man he was. It&#39;s full of knowledge , science so much to learn from him
Sushant Singh so beautiful boy the boy house is so beautiful
I Like his house
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FXuJOxzpM0">https://youtu.be/4FXuJOxzpM0</a>
His room is sooooo  beautiful and he is a great man 😭😭😭love u ❤Miss u ❤😭 come back SSR 😥😭who wants justice for sushant like please and Rhea should go jail
God send him back he had alot of dreams
We want justice ....... <br>Peace in rest SS® Sir ....<br>I wish one day Bollywood nepotism  will destroy .....
Just look at the innocence in his face .
I&#39;m watching this for the 3rd time in a year. I come back again and again to see how much passionate he was about science
One of your best episodes asian paint
Is this the same which is in bandra pali hills?
Love you forever
Sushant I miss you so much
I will surely miss you dear, you are the best..  the only reason i would remember Movies..  you would always stay in my heart.. left us too early.. May you get justice soon.. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#Justice4SSR</a>
Love u Sushant will miss u
Miss u sushant singh rajput sir
Miss you legend❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Will miss you... Forever in our heart......incomplete story....😞
I love his taste in EVERYTHING... I&#39;m not Indian, I don&#39;t even live in that part of the world.  I couldn&#39;t be more different but... in a cottage on the west coast of Ireland... He would have been happy and all his &quot;stuff&quot; would have suited the thick walled, deep windowed wildness of Connemara.  I can sense what a big loss this rising star is to all who loved him.  I can only hope that the truth will prevail and that his precious memory can rest in peace and all who loved him can gently let the tail of this comet go xxxR
😢😢😢😢😢😢susant
i always thought yaar mera kuch connection hai sushant se, matlab i remember watching all his interviews and all his movies, and on 14th june i watched this video b4 i got to know of his demise and i was so happy this vid was released on my birthday and i was thinking ki connection toh hai boss. but then his demise killed me
This house is way better than the new house in which he spent his last breath.....that Rhea make him shift his house.
He failed to show bedroom. It could be an evidence. Or if we find the group who recorded this we can get information  about his bedroom.

Miss u badly SSR. I cried when i see u here. Definitely u didn’t want to get murdered.
😭😭😭😭😓😓😥😥
Is this same 🏠...where riya chakroborty see ghost....😭😭and then he change
God please do not spare the murderers. 😭 Such a huge loss 🙏 my God what a man he was!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rip">#RIP</a>
Here are the Similarities and Differences of Sushanth &amp; Jiah Khan Death Case... let&#39;s have a Look<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fSV4bkaZpo">https://youtu.be/4fSV4bkaZpo</a>
Ye bhoot wala ghar hai???
A dashing personality.... A unique combo pack of everything... Science, acting, singing, dancing etc... It&#39;s hard to believe that he is no more...
Why r u leave this house, if u r not leave this house  may be today you r alive with us sush,miss u sush, plz come back
Whoever says that he is depressed,s/he should consult with psychologist,such a talented actor cann&#39;t be found in World films ever,I challenge that
SSR&#39;s house is well organised with antiques. As he is amazing actor. Likewise his house. Some keep books just as decorative item. But he is quite passionate about it.
Miss you sir 😭😭
Today (22nd August), CBI stepped in his Bandra house, Mount Blanc to investigate his murder, and I came to  watch this video again. Though this one is Capri Heights. Sushant never deserved this painful end💔😭
this home was absolutely representing him.... he should have never moved out.... :(
Jastice for Sushant bhaiya bahgwaan un apradiyooo ko fasii ki szaaa dilayeeee jisne v Sushant bhai k sath aisha kiya h 🙏🙏 missss u sir
Can&#39;t we just get sush back!  😕
Dam he was hot!!!! I’m American and I heard he committed suicide or was murdered?
Sushant ko justice milker hii rhegaa
Sach samne aake hii raheegaaa
SSR u was an angel....❤❤❤god fav child
MOST INSPIRATION TO THE YOUTH ❤❤.... LOVE U SUSHANT.....U WILL BE ALWAYS IN OUR HEARTS...<br> I ALSO DREAM LIKE TO BE AN ASTRONAUT..... I LIKE TO DREAM BIG AND ACHIEVE MANY THINGS 🤗
Bas yaad saath hain. Some people don’t die they become immortal in people’s heart. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ssrinourheart">#SSRinourheart</a>.
Miss you sir
The best person which i ever met in life. The last year also i spend 1 hr with him.  He was one of my best friend and my mentor. I miss you buddy.  And love you alot. <br>See you there
where was his dog when on the day the incident happened
Artistic... Passionate and an incredible soul.....
This is the house he loved it he made it... And Rhea made him move out of this house and finally let him die there alone... What a shame😔
That telescope is MEADE 14&quot; LX600 ACF TELESCOPE WITH STARLOCK priced at ₹14,70,000
So sad
See the charm...<br>❤When he said &quot; Hi , this is Sushant Singh Rajput&quot;...❤ <br>Miss you Man 💔 <br>We all love you from Earth❤<br>Hit like if you agree my words guys 🙌
😪😪😪😪
Very promising gentelmen, he would have succeeded in whatever he would have done, be it TV, movie, short film, dancing, farming, humanity, politics- for better India, astronomy. Inspirational .<br>He would have inspire so many lives.
His absence in his room right now will clearly show how sympathetically you will feel
Actually u know what ,we are foolish that we were following such umdercast people I mean bhikari actors,jiske dimag me kuch nahi uska dhan bhi kuch nahi ,this is the reality of the whole world but kuch diamonds hote hain Jo precious hoten Hain srsly
How may of you watched this video post Sushant Singh&#39;s Unfortunate demise..
Miss you so much sushanth aap jaha kahi ho khus raho bas 🙏😘😘😘 CBI for SSR 🙏
You can&#39;t go.. I refuse to believe the fact. Against impossibility I would hope you will be back.
He was a gem....
Great man
It feels like I knew him so well, like he was my family member or a close friend. Everyday I wake up, and in a few moments reality hits me and I just wish he was still here, wish we could go back to 13th June and PAUSE.
He was damm handsome....can&#39;t take my eyes from him
He is just perfect in every single way. It hurts to say &#39;he was&#39;. This is so unbelievably sad...  😪
They killed him ... Miss you everyday sushant
We want justice for sushant Singh rajput🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😭🙏🙏<br>No CBI no vote
We want justice for our sushant sir🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 😭😭😭<br>No CBI no vote<br>Sushant sir you will be missed 😭😭😭🤤😔😔😥
Watching bollywood for me is no longer the same... 💔 💔 💔 I see Sushant in every way... It is meaningless... His pain and suffering &amp; yet his great potential was never recognized... 💔Love you 💖 Boss...
He was angel, so pure,so innocent, do cute, so handsome, God&#39;s own person. HE WAS MR. <a href="http://perfectionist.no/">PERFECTIONIST.no</a> one can take his place. God bless his soul and punish   those who tortured him.
Aisa ghar sirf ek creative aur positive personality ka hi ho skta h jinhe apni life me bahot kch interesting krna ho 🙏❤️🦋🌪️🌈🔭🔱☘️🙏SSR IN MY HEART IN OUR HEARTS FOREVER❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
