I love him 🌎😭😭😭😭😭😭
Love vd
he is a good person. But I have to mark him the worst lead actor from current lot of actors. why cooli no one was made.. it&#39;s better to watch the old one anytime on youtube!!  Judwa 2 was better remake from the original one.
Hey Varun kese ho
He is just the best 🌟
No real questions asked... Very boring
Varun 💜💜
Coolie no 1 itni ghatiya film hai ye log kitna jhoot bolte hai sabse bakwass film hai coolie no 1 is sal ki
I love varun and even though this movie wasn’t his best, it was entertaining and fun to watch and he did an amazing job!!
I don&#39;t care what haters say about you Varun sir you are so humble down earth kind of a person.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870tv85usPA&amp;t=100">1:40</a> i thought you went to depression after coolie number 1 release on Amazon prime...😂😂😂

Sushant Singh rajput was the Brilliant actor.we miss him 😥💔💔💔😥
Coolie no1 created a lot of buzz for sure. That shows how people embrace this kind of movies and the stardom of varun. But it does not mean the movie was liked. I expected a bit of honesty. The movie was not liked by the audience and they rejected it. Please reflect on where it went wrong rather than blaming the critics or your genuine fans who are trying to give you an honest feedback.
Varun Dhawan should do interviews instead of movies.
Why are they acting like coolie was a hit when we all know that the public did not like it? Just take a look at IMDB to see the public review. Love VD as a person but he should be more honest and the interviewer should not be so chaatu👅
People will be watching it to see how crap of a job you did compared to your uncle Govind
The-one 💖💖🔥🔥🔥
Love you VD😍😍
I love u vd  u are king of my heart ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Varun Dhawan is so precious🥺❤️
Bhul gye kya  sushant sir ko inke bajese apni jaan  deni padithi
