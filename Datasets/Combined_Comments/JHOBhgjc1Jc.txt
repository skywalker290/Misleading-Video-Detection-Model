Chooses combat gear
What did blud start saying after the lightning bro had me dying😂
😂
I first saw this over 7 years ago and still think it&#39;s one of the funniest videos I&#39;ve ever seen
That shit must have been loud as fuck! The lightning strike is capable of rupturing your eardrums, it&#39;s actually well over the pain treshold of 120 dB.
A LOININ BOLL NEALI HEEEYYA
That thick Aussie accent
The lighting strike turned his teeth into marbles.
He did say it was dangerous down there
I can&#39;t wait for the English version
Lebanese English 😂
God says :No.

Thor was saying, Do Not Go In!   🦈
that is the strongest Australian accents I&#39;ve ever heard. I live in Australia too.

Hold on, second I just found out this was fake by looking at the description, and they made other fake viral videos as well, damn! but this is still funny 🤣
It&#39;s usually hard to make me laugh, but this one got me laughing so hard my ears hurt, and the comments makes me laugh even more.
the &quot;hiya&quot; at the end 😂😂😂
Why would you go out when there js a storm 😂😂😂
That accent 💀
oh no the consequences of my own actions
It takes a lightning bolt to turn an Australian man into a more Australian man

JESUS CHOOSES COMBAT GEAR!!
Omg this broke my ears when i heard that lightning
I understood everything he said the first time I heard it. Am I insane?
This video is clearly fake for the following reasons:<br>1) The colour of a lightning strike becomes pinkish-orange when it comes closer to the ground. It doesn&#39;t retain the milk white colour that we see from afar.<br>2) The creator of this video clearly has no idea about how bright a lightning strike is, when it hits the ground. In real life, this tiny GoPro camera would have been completely overwhelmed by the brightness of the strike, based on how close the camera was to the impact. There is no reflection of the lightning on the ground either.<br>3) If you look carefully at the place of the impact, you can see water splashing. In real life, water does not splash like that if it&#39;s hit by lightning. It just doesn&#39;t happen. Oh and speaking of water...<br>4) The ground is extremely wet. In real life, the water would have conducted that electrical charge and electrocuted everybody around. Especially that girl/woman who was standing just 6 metres away from the impact.

literally looked death in the face also there is an episode of ridiculousness where they were talking about pranks and also about pranks from god and this was a prank from god or rather a jump scare I had a similar experience here in Birmingham Alabama from inside my dads  house and when my older but youngest sister out of 2 me and her were at a place down here by the high school I graduated from on may 24 of 2019 but when we were there it was kind of thundering and stuff with some close strikes so i got my phone out and said come on baby give me a good one me think it probably wont happen and in the last few either minutes or seconds I think seconds a really and my self out loud but I think still kind of quiet holy cow I believe i just got that shht on camera and my sister kind of scared and either crying or tearing up a tad then it hit me oh shoot I could&#39;ve died plus my swim suit I was wearing was i think kind of wet or damp man either he answered my call or it was just a coincidence

And she&#39;s not dead?
The real way you can tell its fake without having to analyze the flash/water/pixels 1 by 1 looking for defects is simple. <br><br>AS the lighting bolt is landing the girl starts reacting on the same frame. If this is 30 fps and she reacted same frame that would make her reaction speed less than 33milliseconds at maximum to be able to react that quickly (if its 60 fps then her reaction speed is pure fucking magic.) <br><br>And that would be reacting to the LIGHT alone, not the sound which she wouldn&#39;t hear for at least another 58 milliseconds after the flash of light as the lightning bolt is at least 20 meters away and that&#39;s about the time it&#39;d take the sound wave to travel that distance to get to her ear drums. <br><br>Not calculating the delay before the sound makes it to her brain of course either.<br><br><br>TL;DR she reacted to light so fast the sound couldn&#39;t have even reached her yet at distances small enough to be actually impossible.

So there&#39;s a debunking of this. A video expert found the components he used to construct the shot. Apparently they&#39;re pretty standard pre-packaged special effects.

Ok that&#39;s clearly fake! Everybody who knows anything.. knows that lightening strikes first, cuz light is faster then sound, and then the thunder always follows a couple seconds later! This is all done in one fell swoop! I call bullshit!
We all know this is fake right? The man is also putting on an accent. He&#39;s pretending to be Lebanese Australian when I think Media Watch proved he was anglo white as f Aussie. If he was Lebanese there would be SOME Arabic exclamations in there! His name is Richard Hughes hahaha

The auto captions think he is speaking Russian. When you set it to auto-translate to English, this is apparently what the guy is saying:<br>&#39;&#39; DOLLARS AN OUNCE FOOTBALL TOTAL WEIGHT 600 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SQUARE IN ADDITION THE PLAN TO INTERCEPT&#39;&#39;
sounds like Bill Cosby omfg.
This dude has the coolest accent.  The first time I watched it I didn&#39;t know what language he was speaking, second time holy shit that&#39;s english.

&quot;Ooh ah it&#39;s pretty rocky here, ay?&quot; His whole performance almost sounded <i>too</i> woggy. Is he taking the piss? Dunno.<br><br>Here&#39;s a theory from out of left field: He was making a funny video with his girlfiend, overdoing the stereotypical wog talk for the LULZ. When the lighting struck he showed genuine emotions such as fear and shock.... but he just stayed in character.<br><br>Who&#39;s on board?
Russian Guy????? hahaha
I laugh so hard at this
I&#39;ve been talking like this all day lol

This has been proven as a fake. Made by an Australian production company known for cooking up hoaxes to get attention.
fake!!!!
If you&#39;re wondering what the russian captions say, here you go:<br>- To Paris about municipality&#39;s work.<br>- Here arrived in China.<br>- And it cost&#39;s a lot, and will continue henceforth.<br>- Doll ounce football overall weight.<br>- 600 million dollars square, besides an intercept plan.<br><br>Sounds like he&#39;s talking politics.
omg!!!!!!!!!!!!! SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOFUNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
When you translate the cc it says &quot;dollars an ounce football total weight millions of dollars square. In addition the plan to intercept&quot;

It&#39;s clearly fake, I mean, I got nearly hit my lightning a Month ago and it sounds and looks completely different. Also his reaction was like 0, he didn&#39;t even moved when the lightning struck.

I was born in Australia... What the hell is coming out of this mans mouth?
his accent makes me scream
i put the captions on and it auto-generated to russian! HAHAHAAHHAHA
Leb Aussie accent bruh fuck ya!
this guy is speaking so weirdly that the captions think that he&#39;s speaking in Russian
chooses combat gear
Instead of a CGI shark in Sydney harbor, its a CGI lightning strike!
omg he sounds like he got struck in the head with lightning
ozzy osbourne?
This is Australia... Home of the boomerangs! What ever goes always OOOH MA GUD CUMBACKHEUUUH.<br>thank you
I cant stop laughing lol
The first time I saw this I jumped at the lightning strike. o_o
OH MY FUCKING GOD
he sounds like bill cosby or at least like someone trying to imitate bill cosby
It honestly looks really fake but yet well done, how he conveniently stops in the perfect shot at the perfect time. Also how there&#39;s no other lightning apart from that strike, and lastly they walked by some rocks with a bigger heights than where the girl was
dat ass doe ;)

Since I live here I can tell you this is how about 60% of western Australians speak. It&#39;s the &quot;common&quot; accent.

For the dumbass&#39; saying he doesn&#39;t sound like a &quot;true&quot; Australian, maybe that&#39;s because although this was filmed in Australia, the guy is actually from South Africa. If you actually bother to read the Dailymail article you would know that.......
Jesus come back here! oh my god baby the bloody lightning bolt just missed you! Holy bloody mother of god, Jesus, fucking, my god baby, come back, the lightning bolt nearly hit ya, oh my god baby... You alright?

zeus - nie umiesz celować.
the bloke sounds like he has a fake Leb accent.
I had to switch the speed to 0.5 to really understand what he&#39;s saying,
Obviously this reaction is fake. Otherwise the FineBrothers would already have sued this guy
Thats a heavy accent
Two lightning bolts talking to each other.<br>She is shocking.

Actually, there were two strikes. Other one hit her bf
he sounds russian
He sounds like he ran into a wall.

Fak me his accent
fake 100%
&quot;She&#39;s&quot; cute... from what we can see at least.
If you were to stand that close to a lightning strike your ears would probably bleed.

Thumbs down for vid, but LOL at the post-strike dialogue
What accent is this?
His reaction is priceless 😂😂
I thought this was real until I watched it at 0.25 speed and studied it frame by frame.  Now I am starting to think it isn&#39;t real -- however it&#39;s still a funny video either way.
