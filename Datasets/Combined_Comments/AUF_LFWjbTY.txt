Looks like the mall in Milan.
DEATH TO ISLAM
deportieren zum osten...
That&#39;s the kind of religious problems Trump tries to prevent...  These people want to forcibly introduce their Sharia laws into our culture and that causes these kind and far worse  problems.
stop being racist. its just their way of showing their happiness that we welcomed them
Enjoyed your video &lt;3 <br><br>:D
They should be caught and then deported. Scum like this does not deserve to remain in a democratic country! But as usual Governments/Law Enforcements are &quot;Shiite Frit&quot;. Wish I only knew &quot;OF WHAT?&quot;<br><br>And it is actions like this when people ignore the values and the respect for each other - regardless of religion; that certain groups start a religious persecution vigilante!!!!!
Fucking pigs. They can lick Allah ass
If they don&#39;t like Christmas they are free to go home. Don&#39;t let the door hit you in the butt on the way out - say good bye to freeloading off the dole.  <a href="http://rashmanly.com">rashmanly.com</a>
What I am amazed by is that the majority of the people who commented on this video did not question it&#39;s authenticity. Rather, they blindly believed what the uploader had written.<br><br>You could have asked yourselves simple questions like:<br><br>1. The video isn&#39;t clear - so how do we know they are migrants or even muslim?<br>2. There isn&#39;t any audio.<br><br>Above all, most of you didn&#39;t bother to check the FACTS. Those of you that did (well done by the way) would have found that this was done by locals, not migrants/Muslims. <br><br>Needless fighting is caused because of stuff like this, and can be avoided by checking the facts.
jeez
MOTHERFUCKING SCUMBAGS!!!!!!!

It is unmistakably and undoubtably evident from this crystal clear 240p video of a 144p video they are indeed Muslim. <br>Call Judge Dredd. <br>Gas that shopping center. <br>Nuke that continent. <br>Throw shit let it stain! (Siz anladınız onu kafasına sıçtıklarım!)
They&#39;re not Muslim. they&#39;re a group, of teenagers participating in a tradition. People have said this for another video of a similar incident in Egypt but they also weren&#39;t Muslim. This is also not a Christmas tree but a Wishing Tree that is being vandalized.
This is titled &quot;Muslim immigrants destroy a Christmas tree&quot;... But it&#39;s false!<br>The video shows a local &quot;baby gang&quot; (a gang of teenagers) in Galleria Umberto in Naples. They have been destroying the local Christmas tree every  year for the last few years, in their private war against the shop owners in  the Galleria who want to chase them away (as this gang use this place as a foot ball field, often causing damages to shops). It&#39;s a totally local problem, unrelated to immigrants or Muslims. Actually I find shameful that this video is shared to increase religious hate and intolerance.
poor engineers, doctors, children and women :( they did it because they had to leave their country because of war  : (.<br>poor muslims. Come to Poland, we invite you
You ate good shit elhamdulillah<br><br>İyi bok yediniz ake.
Müslümanları öcü gibi göstermeye çalışıyorlar ama orda o koca yürekli insanlar dikkatli izlenirse bir çam ağacını hapsedildiği saksıdan kurtarmaya çalışıyorlar... Şaka şaka amk dengesizleri napıyor la öyle hahahaha
Naples. Christmas Tree Gallery, here we go again: gang tries to steal it, army thwarts theft | Videos and photos<br><br>Here we go again. As happens every year, the Christmas tree in the Galleria Umberto I in Naples does not find peace. But, unlike previous times, this time it went wrong the gang of teenagers who regularly tries to bring home &#39;the Wishing Tree&#39;, to which residents and tourists rely their wishes by attaching a note.<br><br>The band, made up of a dozen boys, hooded probably not to be identified by the surveillance cameras, went into action at one o&#39;clock last night. In less than five minutes they stripped the tree of lights and the star to make it lighter and can pull down more easily. Once the tree came down, the &#39;commando&#39; was going to drag it out of the tunnel where the use of two soldiers on duty in the vicinity has put to flight the young.<br><br>In the past it happened many times that the tree was stolen only to be found in the neighboring Spanish Quarter where it is cut into pieces and used for the feast of St. Anthony Abbot, when it &#39;s the custom of lighting bonfires ( the so-called stones of St. Anthony). The tree - which is set up at the initiative of Antonio Barbaro, owner of several clothing stores in the gallery - was decked Monday, November 30. &quot;Unfortunately - says Barbaro - I find myself having to denounce once again the attempted theft. I&#39;m sorry &#39;cause that way you steal the wishes of Neapolitan children and the many tourists in the city these days. We will do it again and hope that the perpetrators of this stunt guys have the patience to wait Epiphany to get it. &quot;<br><br>The tree in the Galleria Umberto has become a tradition. The first was set up in 1984. &quot;But at the time - remember the merchant - also he made an artistic crib and there was a security guard who failed the crib, today there &#39;anymore.&quot; The tree will be hauled up and put in place already in the day. But this time with a counter: it will be secured to a steel cable. On-site there is&#39; the municipal police.<br><br>And it remains stunned to think that in such a gallery in the Neapolitan, in Milan, stands in all its glory a Christmas tree Swarovski. Is there, in the heart of the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, 12 meters high and decorated with over 10 thousand ornaments, including more than 1,000 poinsettias, lighted by 36 thousand lights and decorated with silver ribbons. Enchants everyone, guarded and protected. Quite a difference.<br><br>Monday, December 7, 2015, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUF_LFWjbTY&amp;t=754">12:34</a> - Last Updated: 12/07/2015 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUF_LFWjbTY&amp;t=1333">22:13</a><br><br><a href="http://www.ilmattino.it/napoli/cronaca/napoli_tentato_furto_albero_natale-1398460.html">http://www.ilmattino.it/napoli/cronaca/napoli_tentato_furto_albero_natale-1398460.html</a>

Olay yeri Italya, failler sözde müslüman mülteciler, yorum yapanların %90ı ateist türkler..
May imamhatips be closed!
As a Muslim I am saying you can punish them whatever you want
Certainly a provocation. There is no sign whatsoever showing that they are Muslim. These people may well be a group of Islamophobs who did this in order to put the blame on Muslims. Please stop sharing provocative propaganda on youtube.

ÖNCELİKLE GÖRÜNLER 2015&#39;TEN. <br><br>Olayı yapanlar müslüman değiller. Hemen saldırmışsınız her zaman olduğu gibi. Olay Napoli&#39;de gerçekleşiyor ve olayı yapan Napoli&#39;liler  Noel ağaçlarını vandalize edip, çalmaya çalışıyorlar, yakacak odun olarak kullanıyorlar.

En azından ağaca tecavüz etmediler.
This makes me remember a certain scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey.
yalan amq! müslüman diyip durmayın. noel babaya sinirlenen cüceler noeli sabote etmeye çalışmış. ama olay çözülmüş noel baba cüce-sen&#39;in maaşlara zam + ayda 1 kere seks hizmetini kabul etmiş.
lanet olasıca müslümanlar
Yetiş ya mussolini
Boss fighta girişir gibi zavallı ağaca girişmişler.
This is not real Islam...
Mukaddes kitabımız Allah&#39;ın kelâmı Kuran-ı kerim&#39;de Rabb &quot;benim dinim bana senin dinin sana&quot; buyuruyor.Hemen islâma hücum etmeyin kefereler. Böyle serserilerin dini,dili,ırkı olmaz. Muhtemelen bunu yapanlar akraba evliliği falandır

wtf? fanatics are always idiots. it doesn&#39;t matter islam, christians or jews or football teams. howewer, you can&#39;t blame religion. i have so many muslim friends and they are most friendly people in my life. i dont think the islam the evil. or jewish or any religion. stop the fanatics! not believers. <br><br>ps: i&#39;m a Dell&#39;elmo di Scipio! :)
You can bet that they will be targeting religious artifacts very soon. In Italy, there are squares (piazzas) where, centuries ago, people were burned at the stake. Italy need to revive that practice for Muslims.
where in italy? when? i&#39;m italian, never i listen about it
