Mba in  finance weds Mba  in Marketing 😂😂🎉🎉
prep with this song for the shooting location of this movie is best combo for quants and music...
Nobody will read this ik. Its been many years since 2 States released. I have been a big fan of it and somehow my life turned out to be like this in a different way. My childhood friend loves me since childhood and so do I. It&#39;s been almost a decade. But we can&#39;t be together due to family differences. I keep relating to this song. I don&#39;t know how can I support him through this because first and foremost he&#39;s my friend. I&#39;ll not have any happy ending like this movie I know. I just come around to see them happy and maybe read some happy comments from real people who found their happy ending.
i was always soo insecure about me that I always used to tell him that he deserve someone wayyyy better than me .I still remember that day when  I broke down crying before him .And he gave me the best comfort nd   he even  sang  that &quot;kedi teri naraazgi ,gal sun leh raaz gi ,jism yeh kya hai , khookli seepi , rooh di moti hai tu  &quot; nd tere bina ooh mahiya din dariya rain jazeere lagde &quot;for me that day. He gave me that confidence  that I  still carry with me . I dont know  how long we are going to be together ...all I can do is to pray to have u forever .thank u ! Till today this song is something that give me peace .
&quot;Jism ye kya hain, khokhli sipi,<br>Ruh the moti hain tu!&quot;<br>Always gives me goosebumps ❤
Ishhhh❤
Im santhali n my boyfriend is gujarati his family likes me lot, I don&#39;t know how my family would react when I tell them about us. 😂
in 2023
Just no offence to Arijit singh but deep down i feel songs that are not sung by Arijit are the best because they are underrated....Arijit singh is so Overrated....
Power to all broken hearts power to all with incomplete love stories ❤️
Anyone in September 2023???
Favourite One ❤
Mai or meri life partner dono shadi karna chate hai same cast  hai even our my family not supporting me . We are in 2023 but families are living in 1980 era .
Peace❤
Come From munawar Faruqui &#39;s story ❤️🔥
2023......💔 I was in class 11th when i Heard this still gem 💎
I wanna get rid of this what I am feeling right now. It&#39;s hurting like hell
Same condition with me now 💔😑
Originally a Bangla song and poetry. I guess Pritam and Amitava both are from Bengali heritage and culture.
Thsi is teh best song of this movie. Quite underarted sadly.
Loved the songs, Loved the film .......❣❣❣
bal
Not sure who enters in the meeting room like this and tell that boyfriend is here 😂
This is one of the most underrated performance by arjun kapoor
Adhuri kahani, adhura alvida..<br>Yuhi reh na jaye adhure sada 😢<br>Pratik our story can’t be over.. you’re my home ❤ pls come back
Only lovers can feel this song💔 specially after breakup.....😔😭
Wo rishte bohot Kam hote hain iss tarah success pate hain
Jab bhi tumhe apna pyar sataega tumhe yahin ana hoga ❤❤❤

Arjun Kapoor at this point is certainly a Chetan Bhagat&#39;s boy 😆
This song is simply beautiful yet hurtful at the same time
God save this song from Neha Kakkar 😂
This song randomly come in my playlist but it&#39;s awesome ❤❤❤ love it
My sister is going through this phase nowadays just like this movie coz of boy&#39;s family . My sister is now Alia Bhatt and his fiancee as Arjun Kapoor 😢 Movie name 2 castes as we are Bengali Brahmin and the boy is non Brahmin . She has kept a condition if her mother-in-law fully considers her as bahu then only she will keep relationship .
Adhuri adhuri kahanii...adhura alvidaa....😔😔
2013 Amar biyer bochor..amar hasband er jonno khub khub kanna peto...o baire job korto...ei gan ta ami suntam<br>Now I am mother of two baby...but still my love like 2013 for my husband...... I love him forever 💗

Why this song makes me shed tears
❤️
Ishaqzaade &amp; 2 states <br>After that we have lost Arjun Kapoor.
Even mast magan is a beautiful song ❤️
I remember when i was in long distance relationship with a girl from Hyderabad at that time this movie was released,i always tell her that this movie is made on us😅 she was too genuine and loyal but destiny separated us.
Mast movie
While listening to this song and being surrounded by people, I am still wondering why things happened the way they did. Why I didn&#39;t saw that coming. Despite being spring season I wonder why April isn&#39;t blossoming in my arms. ;)
My favourite
people from now 1990-s will understand the situation of their childrens as they faced the situation
Reminds me 2014....struggle...for convincing my family for intercaste marriage.... Always g

The only song which will remind me of her even after many years...miss those days...this song also justifies that in family caste issue is important rather then there children😐😞
Love ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
To be honest I only liked one Arjun Kapoor’s  movie that is this...😊
Epic scene - in the fragrance of the flower market. Dew drops from pearl eyes spill
I just love this song. And whenever i turnned back to listen songs my only choice is this
When you miss someone so deeply and you know things would have been different if he/she was with you right now❤️
Amitabh Bhattacharya is just love 😍.
Love it
❤️❤️❤️
The bgm is so matched with drake&#39;s -passionfruit
My love story right now is two continents, life is great.
I can relate this song...and my ex posted a picture with this song....he is like alia and Iam like arjun kapoor in this song...poor me!
Sometimes I forget, arjun kapoor was there in the film
this entire album speaks what music really is.....absolutely amazing!!!!

Hum bhi kisike ese hi pyar krte the or pagl ki trah pr fir us insan hume janvr ki trah mara pita tb se sara pyar utr gya he ab kahi pyaar nhi hai ab khus he hum khud se bhot pyaar ho rha hai ab. Ab toh akele jineki bhi tmna rkhte hai or sahas bhi ☺️🙌

The lyrics and music ... Uffff it&#39;s just brilliant man.
Reminding of delhi connought place
This song is too surreal to be forgotten, evergreen it is and so meaningful. &lt;3
This song is soooo underrated... And i am glad... Because if this song gets a lot of recognition then people will ruin it by using it on reels
Every single line every single beat<br>Gives me next level of satisfaction
Arjun is super lean in this he looks good
8 years of this legendary song and only legends are still listing
I am not feeling well  without you <br>Plz help me
All you need is patience, hope she understands...
Going through same scenario hope good come to us🚶🏻‍♂️🖤

Any one 2022 listen this song !! Beautifull song

Why relationships are soo complicated 🥺
Too good
Life partners

But I am scared to fall in love thats why I avoid being in amy relation
😭😭😭😭
The only good movie of Arjun Kapoor.
Laal Singh Chaddha Song Sung By Mohan Kanan.. 💙
The story of my love is not different from Two States. Our marriage happened but story went further. We have not met for 4 and half years. We have a six years old daughter. <br>Now She is adamant on giving me divorce and I am struggling so much. No body can understand me. Our families are against each other. I am struggling so much. I am in eternal pain. Just few days back I went to Chennai, she didn&#39;t even met me. I was there for 6 days and then came back to Delhi. <br><br>Praying to her, her family and God. I don&#39;t want divorce. I am ready to do whatever she wants
From 2022 💜
I only read the book ,didn&#39;t watch movie but I can imagine Chetan and Anusa and their struggle to get along together 😍😍♥️♥️
I like that music but can anyone send me the English version of it ?
Nancy 🙏🏻❤️🖤
In the era of Chand baliya i like chandaniya
This song is one of the most connected among all other from this movie it&#39;s just a remorse version.
This song lyrics only that person can understand who&#39;s luv someone  and get breakup
Kedi teri narazgi, gal sun le raaz ki...<br>Jism ye kya h khokli sipi, rooh da moti h tu... ❤️❤️❤️
Anyone listening this melody in 2022
I might sound wrong but I think Arjun acted better than alia in this movie, his expressions in specially the emotional scenes were really good... I really feel he should do emotional movies rather than comedies, his acting skills shine in emotional scenes...<br>Edit: I didn&#39;t mean that Alia didn&#39;t act well! I just meant that Arjun did better than her in this movie. Anyways, this is <b>MY</b> opinion. I respect yours, you respect mine. Peace out✌🏻
Ananya doesn&#39;t love krish more 😪She is with Ranbir 😅
A
Extremely touchy ❤ when the body is just going on, mentally and emotionally dead. <br>P.S.: When you know you are 22, and that you&#39;ll never get committed.
Who is here after ranbir alia marriage? Some how I felt like watching this song now
Such an entertaining film!!
This scene is so similar to dear zindagi! It feels like Alia probably regrets her love for Arjun for whom she loved after 7 years!
Adhuri Kahani reh naa jaaye hits me badly
Song is awesome😊 but look at the dialogue &amp; look at arjun&#39;s dialogue delivery 😂
Sankarmahadevan&#39;s masterpiece 🔥❤️
In search of my Chris....🤗....Ananya☺️✨
Really awesome song 🎵 👌
We need to start mentioning singer, composer, lyricists names first before the actors as they deserve more credit for creating beautiful pieces like these.
Even in 2022 still can feel this song♥️♥️

Really nice song
Yesterday this song was suggested by my gf and i heard it numerous tyms and this song full of emotions 😘
Jism yeh kya hain khokli seepi ruh da moti hain tu... 💓💓💓
Arjun and Alia look so nice together, But it is a surprise that they have not done any movie since the 2 States
This is my all time eternal song. The music and and lyrics just so beautiful.  A song that can help me feel music and emotions.<br><br>Special place also goes to the picturisation of the song, so beautiful. 💗
I love this song ❤️
This movie would be more popular among Bangladeshis if Aishariya Rai was there instead of Alia Because Bangladeshi people does not recognize quality good language skills and ideals of a person as such Alia Vhat. The whole society would vote only Aishariya Rai for becoming an actress of &quot;the game play&quot; of the movie with no good language skill.
Bhai isse number block karna nahi aat kya. Kisi aur se block karwyegi
Beautiful song 👌
Masterpiece
in dono ki shakal dekhke gana sunne ka man nahi hota
💔
That smile on face of Alia @ 2.55..<br>Is the real definition of true love..!!!
Hats Off To Shankar Ehsaan Loy &amp; Amitabh Bhattacharya to Sach a Masterpiece 🙌<br>When 1 first Listened it , it&#39;s Bas Guitar Riff reminded me of Song &#39;Dil behelta hai mera, aapke aa jane se&#39; , But It&#39;s Totally Different
Probably the best role in Arjun Kapoor&#39;s whole career .👋
7 years and it&#39;s the best memory of my first love . Still refreshing 💕

Adhuri hai Kahani..<br>Adhura Alveeda..!!!<br>I don&#39;t how many people can relate to this but many of us have such a relationship which never got the closure which we deserve..!!!<br>I really hope one day at least for one day we all get chance to spend time with our partner who left us without saying anything..<br>Without explaining anything..<br>We surely don&#39;t deserve this..<br>Instead of loving so much one day they will leave..<br>1000s of questions.. But only one answer SILENCE
Kya gana Hai...in Loop more than 35 times..kuch to baat Hai...chaandaniya.. phir kyu mere haath andhere lagate Hain.. it&#39;s just too Good.. Thank You for writing such soulful words..and flawless singing and soothing music..Tere bina oo mahiya din dariyaa.. Raain Jazere lagde ne..

par saja to mujhe mil rhi na...this line hits me ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I married someone outside my community. Everyone was against it. We too had a moment like this before we got married. But I was so crazy in love that I accepted the SH!T he said as a lover&#39;s quarrel. I practically forced my folks to accept him and his family. 10 years I went through the marriage in the name of love. The funny thing is, all this was after I read the book 2 States. Even when I saw this scene while I was still being abused, it didn&#39;t hit me that I was in denial. Love makes you blind, deaf and dumb.
September 2021 and this song is still lit
This song for heart broken men.  Who can&#39;t  express but still silently love her whole heartedly but pain is killing him silently.
She is muslim and i am Hindu and right now both of us hear this song 🙏...hope our family give support
Some songs are never getting old still evergreen
ye song sun ky mery golden years 2013, 2014 shiddat se yad ata ha clg days kash ye waqat wapis asakta ye wo waqat ha jo marty dam tk nh bhol sakta i love my these days 😔😐🤫🤫🤫🤐😪
Q. Krish garam garam parathe kyu nahi kha raha ?<br>a. Krish ka pait gharab hai.<br>b. Krish ko ananya ki yaad aa rahi hai<br>c. Paratho mai jehar hai <br>d. Voh thaak gaya hai <br><br>Q2. Kyu aaye ho krish ? <br>a. Bhag ke shadi karne <br>b. Takleef se dur karne <br>c. Ananya ko Nuksan pahuchane<br>d. Sorry bolne <br>🙂
Jism ye kya hai ...khokli seepi ....jism da moti hai tu❤️...most heart touching line
7 years of this beautiful song, still it gives goosebumps whenever you hear it,❤ one of the most underrated song 🙌
Still fresh in 2021. All songs from the album are so soothing.

Ronit Roy is so underrated!
Loving the vibe of this music
The story started with the recommendation of the same book, and she left one day. And the guy is still there, waiting... with this song.<br>I hope she is happy, wherever she is... 😊
Me and my gf are at the same point right now due to caste issues. I am from Gujarat and she is from Chhattisgarh. Her family is not accepting me and her family has disconnected each &amp; every contact between us. 😔😔

U gareeb middleclass people jo Dekh Senti ho rahe .. Remember<br>Years later - Alia Bhatt with OLD PLAYBOY n<br>ARJUN KAPOOR with OLD MILF<br>so Rone se acha, Dusra Young partner Find karlo😂😂😂<br>Warna U end like them😂
WHY GIRLS ARE SO RUTHLESSSSSSSSSSS.
I don&#39;t listen to this song cuz it reminds me of someone else but rather because it reminds me of myself and how with every passing year i lose myself from someone who was once very passionate and had dreams to someone just mediocre and average
Patanjali* Stm pls wapis aaja.<br>It feels yeh movie hi hum par bani h, bas hum ek nahi hue
The time when Arjun Kapoor could act😁
Best song of my life. Really awesome. Loved it
Starting 2021 with this ❤️

Sirf ek movie jahan Arjun Kapoor hagte-hagte bcha.
🙃
🙂🙂🙂
This is hurting me..
❤
An underrated song yet so meaningful.❤..every line is relatable.
2 States and Badrinath Ki Dulhania, two of my guilty pleasure movies. Alia looked so.cute and pretty in both, and both movies had some nice songs.
Underrated song.....breakup guys will know the pain of this song... thanks to Bollywood....
Yeh song itna clear hai itna emotional hai ki Dil jab bhi udasi Mai ho toh Dil KE sabse jayada kareeb Jo hota hai uski yaad Mai maan kho jata hai ...
This bank made investors cry 😢.
Most of the times , parents push one kid to the limit where he or she doesn&#39;t want to come back.i don&#39;t know why? I have lost my younger brother because of my father mentality,if I had a job I would have lived the same life cus I am being pushed over the limitations on their decision.i have been judged for having manners and intelligence.
Some masterpieces remain underrated<br>Sad
I love alia in 2 states
Garaz Ho Jitni Teri<br>Badle Mein Jindadi Meri<br>Mere Saare Bikhre Suron Se Geet Piroti Hai Tu<br>O Mahiya.. Tere Sitam, Tere Karam<br>Dono Lutere Lag-de Ne <br>Best line ❤️
Life is so same like movie
This movie, this novel, every song of this is just...<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23op">#op</a>🔥🔥
any one else belt the chorus out when they&#39;re in the shower or are you guys normal?
Who is listening in the end of 2020?
When I was in 11th I used to listen this song and felt like I had breakup with my gf but then literally I asked myself I don&#39;t have any gf man😂..<br>This entire album very close to my heart, it&#39;s reminding me each n every moment of my college journey where I started my college ❤️❤️❤️..2 States is like HUMARE JAMANE KI MOVIE 🍿🍿🍿❤️❤️
Iska bhi kataaaaaa
This song pulled best out of arjun Kapoor
This song has something amazing which force me back to listen time to time ...<br>Love it ❤️

And we broke up.....
I love you alia bhatt😍😍😍😍
This song has my heart FOREVER 💙
🧡🤍💚🎵🎻🎺🎸🎶
Years passed ,still one of my favorites <br>❤❤❤
This music video is very well-directed. You can notice this at many points during the video, none more than the point when Alia Bhatt starts walking away and the music starts playing at the exact same time.<br><br>This song is so beautiful, it deserves much more praise for its background score and amazing lyrics.
Arjun Kapoor ko romantic genre h karna chahiye baki m toh chalta nahi h
Why intercaste marriage not allowed???? Family k liye apni pyar ko b sacrifice karnapadta hai...I wish when ever u are plz happy that...😭😭😭 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23deekshya">#Deekshya</a>
Me to sala yeh song bhi oct me sun rha hu 🙃😅..koi h mere jesa???
&quot;Chaandaniya to Barse, fir kyu mere hath Andere lagte..??&quot; ye lines aaj most of a Boys ke Sath real me chal rhi h✨ even I&#39;m keep repeating that same Line Ques. everyday to the Universe.🙄💭🥺
❤️
&quot;Mere saaare bikhre suron se geet piroti hai tu&quot;  Amazing af
Awesome song, awesome lyrics this song is a gem in this movie ,, only irritating thing is arjun kapoor apart from that everything is top notch👍
One of the two good films done by Arjun Kapoor 🤣🤣
A good lesson is always important for yourself...
Chandaniya to barse..<br>Fir kyu mere...haat andhere rahde ne 💔
Just saw the trailer for Ginny weds Sunny and Vikrant Massey would have been so much better for this role!!

My all time favorite song why undrreted yrr 🙁
M muslim or vo hindu finaly uske parents bhi support nhi hindu hota to shayed kar bhi lete. Hum dono ek dusre k bina nhi. Mare ghr wale mari shadi bhi khi. Tired hogya hoon y sb se. Kya kre nhi smjh rha h. Uske parents ko vo choad nhi skti bec. Vo apne parents s bhi pyar 1 din bhi nhi alag. Kya karu nhi smjh rha h time kam hai.....

This Arjun Kapoor is lost somewhere.
This song is so underrated. Nobody ever talks about it. A golden gem in this album. Only true music lovers will come back to this song.
garam garam parathe bhi nahi khaaye
Regrets are part of human life......delimma of choosing between yr parents and lover......I should have adhered to my decision........

adhuri kahani hi reh gyi
2020 me bhi sun raha
When i was studying for engineering and she took admission in bsc after 2yrs of coaching for medical.. her parents were use to ask my gotra, my plans , my choice.. in her studies i supported her like anything so that she can achieve her dream to be a doctor.. now she is a doctor and i am preparing for my job and her parents said i dont meet her standards. Try to make some distance from him. And now yesterday she was asking me for a nice good bye. And when i couldn&#39;t handled this thing i started crying and calling her again and again.. now she blocked me from everywhere. 🤣 its been three days I didn&#39;t sleep feeling sick and msging and calling her again and again while i knw tha i am blocked.. 🤣and suddenly this song played and after watching this everything turned black. 😅
Still reading the book😙😙😙
Sach mai thak gya hun.....ye kahani aadhi hai , puri mujse sun lena
baki sab to apni jagah hai parathe ki kya glti, gussa to parathe khane k bd bi kiya jaa skta h

Shankar Mahadevan ❤️ Right up there with the greatest...... Great lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya.
I have deep feelings for this song.. Right now I am in the same situation of Alia bhatt. I broke up with him as family is not accepting us but it feels like hell. My best wishes for him.
I also like a Tamil girl. Her name is also Ananya. Let’s see what happens 😊
Song is awesome... But I come here for that conversation.... 💔💔💔
Gana to achha h, par ye bhi yad rkho ye T Series ka h. Naam hi kafi h darane k liye

Many Indian couples have same situation..
close to my heart
who came here just after hearing about yes bank?
Teenage days ❤️❤️
Kids : remember their gf/bf<br><br>Men: I am single. <br><br>Legends: Feeling sorry for YES Bank..
If you&#39;re listening to this. I have to say you have a good taste in music.
-Haam peyar katre hain ek dusre se, Kafi nehi hain? <br>-Kabhi nehi hota.
The comment section is the true reflection of the reality the film is based on.
I have been in such situation... <br>But the saddest part is that in spite of trying so very hard... <br>Lastly I attended her marriage😕
Everyone&#39;s taliking about their stories but no one&#39;s talking about how beautifully the song has been composed by SEL
Who is watching after the Yes Bank debacle?
😍👩‍🏫😔
In our India, why we give more importance to Caste, religion, state rather than Love. Because, there is One God everywhere. Love has not Boundary of any Caste, religion, love is like independence and freedom.... :)<br><br>In India we take Religious as too much serious.

Might sound weird. Even stupid, but I can&#39;t imagine anyone else in this role other than Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt. They were perfect.<br><br>P. S. I should&#39;ve added that what I&#39;ve stated above is what I feel. Everyone has their own opinions which might differ from mine, and I totally understand and respect them.

Farak bas itna hai ki mai or wo apni family ko shadi ke liye mana nahi paye or ek nahi hue wo bas muje chor kar kisi or se shadi kar li meri life uske bina adhura hi rah gaya.. aisa sirf filmo me hota hai real life me ham kuch kar hi nahi pate.. Hamare pyaar ko kas family samaj pate.. Nice movie
Me and bf are from two different caste he is Maharashtrian and i am punjabi... In our relation we also came at a point where we can leave eachother but we waited and show trust  n now finally  after 4 years we are getting married  with our families blessing
Vima kumar i love you song

There is nothing like love it&#39;s a temporary feeling just focus on your life eventually you will get married so stop wasting time filmo k chutiyape mai mat pado
Kuch hade hai tumhari...<br>Kuch hade hai hamari....<br>Lekin daayro mai bhi ishq hota hai....
❤💖
I just want to cry by hearing this song
