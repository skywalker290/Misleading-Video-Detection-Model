Children should see this.
Yes, that&#39;s correct. Mars and Earth are at varying distances from each other as they orbit the Sun. Communication signals, which travel at the speed of light, take approximately 6 to 8 minutes to traverse the distance between the two planets. This time delay is known as the one-way signal travel time and is an important consideration for communication with Mars rovers, spacecraft, or future human missions.<br><br>ChatGPT 🌹

Most underrated movie in indian cinematic history
Anyone watching this after the launch of LVM3-M3 launch recently made by ISRO?
Bull shit movie:-<br>Showing our scientists as cartoons and jokers, unnecessary religion discrimination and pseudo feminism, no proper code of conduct for a mission and many more....waste!!
Anyone here in 2023?

the fact that even Indian govt wasn&#39;t with them(just 400crores fund) but they still decided to make the impossible possible for the country&#39;s honour , made it even more touching .It just enraged me that the illiterate politicians spend crores on election campaigns, etc while our gems, riding broken scooters to work at ISRO ,are labelled as tax wasters if they fail.

This movie does not do justice for the situation, incidents feels like unrealistic.<br><br>I understand womens must have played important role in the mission but this movie is showing like isro is being run by 90% womens 😄<br><br>Scientists are dancing &amp; cracking jokes 😄<br><br>Even a 20mins YouTube video can tell you more practical and scientific information than this movie.<br><br>Only housewives who doesn&#39;t have much understanding about space and space missions will like this and get inspired from this movie. 😄
Everyone is saying about the story yes story is really amazing but also tell about the all actors and Akshay Kumar well done this movie makes me proud of my country 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 heads off India 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

I love how ignorant these indians are being completely okay with the communal, anti hindu story of this movie. No wonder these Indians were invaded and made slaves for over 1000 years by arab islamic foreigners. The entire Muslim community would go rioting all over social media if in any way they were to show Muslims in a negative manner. Just have a look at these hindus and indians.

WORST FILM EVERI IN HISTORY OF SPACE FICTION FILM
I get crying in end when India go to mars
Keep on comments...who knows??? The secret of universe may be arround each one of us...use 100% of whatsapp...share your views about mars...this will help scientist to know our existance and end...
This move is really awesome. It&#39;s inspire you , and tell us about our ISRO scientists who have been working hard to explore space. We all  Indians feel proud on them. When we see their achievement it tell us -  We can achieve any thing if we have the passion and work hard to achieve it. We all know the history about ISRO how it started?👍👍
haha nice movie
It&#39;s an true inspiration. I literally got tears at the end. This is a must watch ❤️
Today I am watching mission mangal
Well Done India !  Accomplishing the mission is the priority, and you did it on your first try.  I wish you future success.  <br><br>ISRO is better than CNSA!
kya mangal par koi insan h 🤔
Dekhne layaq to ye movie hai jo impossible ko possible karne ka jajba deti hai. Romance and love story to misguide karti hai.......
Very nice movie... Scientist job very tiring.... Hats off to them... We can never ever match them.... Look after family and work at the same time...... Real heroes..... 🙏🙏🙏
I actually cried when I saw the ending of this movie 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

One of the best movie. I loved it a lot watched film around 100 times. Lots love and respect to our scientists 🙏
Yes this movie is a masterpiece but guys don&#39;t expect we will have all that cool technology stuff guys. Once the rocket is aboard, no one can control it. You have to determine trajectory and orbital mechanics for the whole flight well in advance. Pure mathematics and completely different from what we see in this movie.

If this is a Hollywood film: we show greatness of scientists and engineers and rise of isro <br><br>But in bollywood: we don&#39;t care if they are great or not we just want to force patriotism and force on one point that just india is great.

Biggest motivational movie
Amazing film that shows the many ups and downs in everyone&#39;s life, including scientists&#39; and that HARDwork reaaaallllly pays. The way the rocket and satellite were made in Mangalyan mission is incredibly awesome!!!! India is the first country to reach Mars in the very first attempt:all thanks to the masterminds- the scientists. <br>I watched this trailer today and had goosebumps and tears. Then, watched the movie today only and came back to comment.
Ap k sary kam bollywood me hi hoty ha reality me nahi
First of all this film is total waste of time and money, instead of this we should watch the real documentary which shows the real emotions and hard work of those scientist, This Akshay Kumar doesn&#39;t even know what it takes to be a scientist and the rest of them also. You guys didn&#39;t even showed heroes who did this work.<br>Ever wonder why these movies doesn&#39;t win oscars because these guys show too much and playing a shitty rock music in the trailer.<br>and lastly why they showed the quran scene in the movie which is absolutely nonsense....these guys are connecting mars with religion, Jagan Shakti you should concentrate on your dumb film.

Truly an amazing film
Love Indian movies and I believe Indians are smart to do a mission like that with a budget like that.<br>No doubt they are one of the smartest people ever
This movie inspired my daughter to become an ISRO scientist. When I asked her why she said, &quot; I want to serve my India like Tara Shinde , Rakesh Dhavan and all other scientists of Mars Orbiter Mission. I want to do the impossible. &quot; Really great movie !
Very inspiring flim 👍👍👏👏👏
isro budget = 70 million dollars  Falcon 9 cost = 60 million <br>lol<br>and by the way, falcon 9 is a privately own rocket <br>and way stronger than gslv India&#39;s strongest rocket

Officer : Kaha se layenge 800 crores<br><br><br>Akshay kumar : mere pass ek scheme he 25 din me paisa double
It was a great a movie but I feel that there where some errors in the movie. The launchpad shown in the movie looked more like Kenedy space centre than the one in Shriharikota. And they added to much bollywood masala to it, man. Like come on bollywood should stop putting item songs in Biopics, like &quot;dil mein Mars hai&quot;. No hate to the song but come on its a biopic. But ig overall it was a great movie, they could have done it even more better.
I also got tears in end of movie🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂and felt shame on myself what i had have ever done anything for my country, i asked it to myself🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Akshay Kumar is the best actor in indian history.  He&#39;s a patriot both in reel and real life.

Blockbuster 🎥
One of my most inspiring movie ❤️😍
I don&#39;t know why Bollywood is embarrassed of south India and dark skin. Based on real story but changed main character to north indian and show fair actor and actress with perfect figure. Not realistic at all. Consider Akshay Kumar&#39;s movies like airlift, padman, Mission mangal etc.  all south real life people are showed as north people in movie. It lives in fiction and portrays wrong image of India.
I seriously don&#39;t get who the hell are those disliking this🙄

Awesome trailer

documentary made by national Geographic on isro is 100 time better then this movie......kam se kam film banane se pahle vo documentary hi dekh lete.....in documentary there is real scientists.. Who explain all about mars mission in scientific way.... But in Bollywood movies...stupid drama and meaningless  nonsense story is necessary..... Just take inspiration from Hollywood sci-fi movies... People also watch movies without songs. Before making sci-fi movie just study little bit . .
I am not an Indian...but still this movie made me proud..one of the best movie of bollywood..love from Bangladesh
Mere ko aaj tak shrif 2 movies excite kiya hai<br>2016- ms dhoni the untold story<br>2019-mission mangal
1 actor akshay <br>4 actress 1 sonakshi 2 vidya <br>3 tapsee 4 kriti
Best movie I have ever seen 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍I watched it nearly 10 times but still not get bored
It could be the masterpiece if makers don&#39;t wasted their time on showing scientist&#39;s personal life&#39;s.
This was a masterpiece
Sab acha he movie me, bas vo annoying sa mission mangalam remix baja baja k saari seriousness udadiya.....
Why u people casted Sonakshi Sinha

203
Ekta Kapoor was planning to take the up the story...thank god it didn&#39;t happen...she would have taken like another Nagin....lol
Dedicated to scientists of ISRO but changed their south Indian names to north Indian names. Namaskara Bollywood.
I literally cried at the end of the movie. This is a must watch
Movies may he her kam kerna chutay🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

The One thing that never made sense in Movie was Nanda Shinde&#39;s Background Story. On One hand we see Nanda a Scientist who is Both a Rational Thinker &amp; a Devout at the Same time. But on another hand we see her Son who is so Ridiculously stupid that he decides to Change his Religion because A.R.Rehman did so. While A.R.Rehman Changed Religion for Spiritual Reasons, the Boy in the Movie thinks Changing Religion is a Pathway to &quot;Success&quot;. Hardwork, Determination &amp; Positivity, and not Changing Religion will guarantee Success.  We see movies to soothe &amp; Entertain our Minds not to be reminded of Disturbing/Controversial topics like &quot;Changing Religion&quot; (So why even Depict them in a Movie?) And the Movie Makers should have shown Nanda more Clearly &amp; Firmly explaining her son that &quot;Success can&#39;t be achieved only/just by Changing Religion&quot;
2.20 goosebumps

Mangalyaan project cost is 450 crore rs ... This movie revenue is around 300 crore just like that.. I think movie team should share atleast 10% of the profit with ISRO

Ye picture acchi hai...par isme beech beech me aisa dikhaya gaya hai muslim  me convert hona is not a big deal, neha Siddiqui character represents that love jihad is just a myth. Eka Gandhi represents that sleeping with random person is ok. Akshay Kumar shown as athiest. I mean what was wrong with director. Picture banaa raha tha yaa propaganda phela raha tha.
what an incredible movie it is ,indeed.Go and watch .

I think most of the names in the movie mostly related to north indian names actually most of them are south indians don&#39;t want to discriminate between them but they may be compromised because it&#39;s a bollywood film

I kindly request the makers of mission Mangal to put this film on Netflix or amazon prime, and people who agree with me and want this thing to happen then please hit the like button on my comment and as well as on this video.
Too good...
🤔😃😉Best good movie

Movie bahut acche thi.par is movie ke  lead role me kisi Indian ko hona chahiye tha Canadian ko nahi. Akshay doesn&#39;t deserve this movie . He earns a lot of money through fake deshbhakti emotional drama and he has decided to go to Canada after retirement from bollywood.shame on you Akshay and on all the Indian fans of this Canadian. Jai Hind .

Why does this movie oil Muslims?  Why did this movie show that a boy of a hindu family reading quran and a women not having a room for rent being a Muslim? It also showed a great scientist of india having not faith in prayer.    Why is bollywood doing this? Why is bollywood hindu phobic and why is it oil Muslim?
Kuch bhi

Finally Bollywood has something noble for  children
waw very hard mission mangal
kabir♡💪🐆🐆
the cooking theory scene is similar to in the habibie&#39;s movie from indonesia
Ishi
i saw the movie and   i still dont see the resemblence between the puri and  the  orbital  ocillation technique  does the  producer or director think the public are idiots .   in which case the cheap vfx of the rocket and  orbit justifies .   ( i believe the real people who were responsible for the mangal mission  cant stop laughing  ). the movie itself looks like a 90s movie  excluding akshayji&#39;s  audi .   anyone else  who  denies my  comment plz watch  armageddon  its an old flim but  way better then this
I&#39;ll never watch this movie bcoz of sona
Mission Mangal. Super Best

Nahi why they wasted 800 crores, in India so many city&#39;s are there, there is no fly over to cross the road, instead of wasting 800 crores, build fly over in all city&#39;s, people are not able to cross the roads, and what&#39;s there in NASA, feed poor people atleast u can spend 2 crores for this.
Reality ma pohanch skty nhi isliye indians Film ma hi pohanch gay MARS ; )
Bidya balan we love u ❤️

Chand par pouchy nahi mass jaye gy
It&#39;s no use of all these missions spending a large number of money on the other hand people are lacking of the food , roads etc .
Watched today this movie...I must appreciate the whole team of ISRO for their wonderful efforts for their mission to mars in reality also and no doubt the whole movie is fantastic....👍👍👍<br> From Pakistan....♥️♥️
Director Jagan Shakti keeps his ambitions—and the space mission story arcs—light and digestible. It&#39;s entertaining for sure, but could he have aimed higher?  Read the review here: <a href="https://lifeisacinemahall.com/?p=4307">https://lifeisacinemahall.com/?p=4307</a>

Apart from India&#39;s dedication to space science this movie can teach us countless lessons of life. I wish to see my neighbour country India flourish, and that success should be the only fight Between us. Let&#39;s create more space rockets instead of missiles. May both neighbours live and prosper happily forever. LOVE FROM PAKISTAN. REMEMBER THIS ALL 🇵🇰❤️🇮🇳

Mission mangal superrbbb film 👌👌👌🔥🔥❤❤
It looks like the Hollywood movie &quot;Hidden Figures&quot;.......
Indian movies need to step up their game for science fiction movies yaar. We want something thats not too over the top and actually focuses on the theme.
low-quality animations and vfx . bollywood needs to start doing some good quality animations like interstellar and all.
Movie ka link send please

Good story but terrible movie.
Rohit yadav ji
I loved movie but 1 thing hurts me a lot is AK says Tambi..vaada in Bangalore ISRO.its not necessary to use or portray Tamil atleast when you say it in Bangalore Isro.<br>Also No freedom given to Veteran Kannada actor Dattatreya to speak in Kannada. Why he should talk in Hindi at home with his wife..Don&#39;t know..So in natural..<br>South India is not equal to Madarasis.AK has acted in Sandalwood Kannada movies before he was star..Why Bollywood portray always south Indians as Tamils.<br>Already In Mumbai ...dominated with Hindi..Over Marathi...Request Bollywood to distinguish different language ..Culture of South Indian states..<br>Agree or Disagree..
I am kannadiga  what a movie I got inspiration
Mere cainal ko suscribe please
