Interesting yet Intriguing Movie
हर कलाकार के चरित्र के साथ धोखाधड़ी की गई है इस फिल्म मे एक भी ऐसा कलाकार का चरित्र नहीं जो उस      किताब पर पूरी तरह आधारित हो।
Feel sorry for them, maybe their love can change the war between their contries, Iqbal loves her wife sadly he didnt get the chance to know that he&#39;s going to ba a father

Varun, Sidharth, Aliya enter together but in terms of success Aliya is far better than them.
Aalia such a talented actress
Plz raazi film you tube may daldijiya
Q
ان. اغلقت الهاتف ياموساد فتاكد انني اما في غزة او ايران او انتحرت مبروك لقد انتصرت
ahhh they are so obsessed with 🇵🇰
My favourite movie
One of the best spy movie ever made.
no women are allowed in a mitti dena/burial of any person after their death according to Islam, how come she was present there that too as the only woman present there at the time and pouring mud/dirt in the grave of her father, this is something only men are allowed to do from carrying the deceased to the graveyard n burying him/her is what only men do according to preaching of islam. That scene was soo out of the context of realism in films, it&#39;s one of many reasons why its sooo bollywood(where anything is possible and gravity doesn&#39;t apply and gives a fuck to realism to even serious films such as this)!!! Hey director this is a tip for you, at least get your facts straight before you launch a film like this with a scene like that, even an illiterate Muslim from the streets  would realise that scene is never possible in this world in any part of the world if its a Muslim burial.... the director is a real joke of this film without a shred of a doubt, I don&#39;t know how come the other members(the actors, crew members, producers, etc) of the film did&#39;nt realise and point it out to him/her, whoever the director is....and btw this film is more of a fantasy than a real one, I&#39;d rate it 3 out of 10. however, that&#39;s just my personal opinion, I think a better Director would have done a lot better than the one that directed this( what an ignorant, selfish and uninformed/illiterate director, fie fie, fie upon thee)!!!
This is one of the times where we can’t be anti-Muslim. The Pakistani Muslims said… “convert, flee, die.” When trying to take over Kashmir. But if the Kashmiri Hindu people converted they’d still have a heart for India.
You tube pe vedio kaise dekhe
Pakistani army ko great bata rahe hai.
Nice movie
Plz plz plz plz 😔
Plz upload Raazi movie plz plz plz
Ye movie YouTube par mil jayega kya 😞
I used to hate Alia Bhatt but after watching her performance in Raazi and Gangubai I can say she is talented actress

Ok this Gandhi-Godse dispute was settled by the bollywood daughter Alia. Good is intelligence agency and locking the door. I have daughters too. The door is locked. Good.
I love how he goes all in on the owners and chefs but always stays respectful towards the waiters
قصتي الحقيقية
Yah true&#39;story ha
Chuttia movie  history ki
Watch Alternating media &quot;Ex navy Harinder Sikka&quot; revealed the reality of this gulzar daughter ,karan ,liberdo gang dividing India with propaganda.  <br>Only one watch before deleting feels I done something.<br>Jai hindi
അടിപൊളി movie✨️❤️
Me having few questions and confusions after 4yrs, in the last of Raazi it&#39;s showing that INS Vikrant have destroyed Submarine Ghazi but, In the movie Ghazi Attack it&#39;s shown that INS S21 Has destroyed Ghazi 🤔
Dogs every time barking and you example of barker dogs
And remember bastard indian isi always top intelligence agency in the world
Very good 😍
سنلعب لعبة الشجاعة قريبا
Many Muslims still in India give their lives for our country, but still, the majority ask us how nationalist we are and shame them. We Muslims are patriots we bury our bodies in our mother India land.
Wow 😲 That&#39;s Awesome 🤩 Movie 🔥 Congratulations 🎉💝 Aliya Bhatt Maam 💕 Your The Best Super Duper All Time Hits 💥 Actior Queen&#39;s 👑❣️ And Smile And Your The Best Telented Actior ❣️ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23raazi">#Raazi</a> Movie 🔥 Is The Best Super Duper All Time Hits Blockbuster Box Office Collection Dhamaka No.1 Movie 🔥
Great movie and patriotism. Great Armed Forces of both the countries. But, one question is how India can justify the attacks and the hatred for Pakistan 1971, only to split Pakistan. Wow.
A pity as no English subtitle... Indian Thriller so good... I would have loved to be able to understand what s going on in the movie
The saddest part is that her husband and her in laws treated her well as their own daughter,sister, but they still got betrayed by her🥺
Salute to all our undercover heroes<br> Nothing is more important than nation <br>Not even emotions, some people&#39;s blood and family<br>But but but.......<br> in this movie in the last scene <br> sehmat is shown so emotionally broken, weeping and crying<br>Why ???<br>But in reality she feel so proud on herself for what she did <br>Do you think that this type of service that she did is the work of a lady who is emotionally weak<br>No <br>She was a very strong lady<br>A true especially trained soldier <br>She was knowing what she was doing and what would be it&#39;s results<br>A successful mission <br>Given her everything for her country and that is called &quot;Sarvoch Balidaan&quot;<br>And giving your Sarvoch Balidaan is a proud thing and not a thing to regret <br>But here also bollywood has shown what it is
Yaar ye movie youtube pe q nhi kisi ko mile to link sed karo pls
Writer tumhara<br>Actors tumhare <br>Producer tumhara<br>Director tumhara<br><br>Kuch bhi fake story ban k propaganda karo kis ne verify kerna <br><br>Bas movie mein Pakistan ki bashing Karo aur paisa kamao apni bewaquf public se !!!!

The Exception  movie 🙏 REMAKE 🙏🙏
Espionage is the most difficult thing some of spies even killed in other countries and their family didn&#39;t even know about it and so is their country, There are literally countless ppl who have given their lives for ppl like us .
And then ppl of India said Muslims to go Pakistan or India is not their country so guys that&#39;s the fact that Muslims have given more sacrifices for India than Hindus in history.
Alia bhatts best movie<br>Top class performed
Aliya ne Sabit kr dia tha iss Movie me ki she is best female actor<br>Very beautiful movie
At the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjMSttRJrhA&amp;t=54">0:54</a> mark, Alia Bhatt pronounces &quot;gharwaale&quot; as &quot;gurrwaale&quot;!

Movie title
Being a Pakistani I am thankful to team Raazi for creating such an admiring movie iss jang mein koyi nhi jeet raha balke dono taraf masoom maray jaa rahay hai
Movie to bhut hi pachhi hai bt ..uska end pachha nhi laga ...kyaki sara movie me hr pal twist hai pr end me aaliya or uske pati ko maar dalne k kita jo kiya wo halat hai...kyaki dono ek dusre ko itna pyaar korte the or aaliya n to hindustan k liye bahut bada maksad pura kiya tha ...To end pachha nhi hai...&amp; Aaliya ki acting is very very super👌👌
Bullshit movie. She betrayed the family that gave her shelter.

Konusu adı nedir
Loyalty of Indian Muslims is shown in this movie. Yet some religious and ethnic jingoist fools alienate them. I just have one word Sorry to all Loyal and Hurt Muslims.
Alia kapoor family ke ijat tum rakhhogi agey suspop acting
Super Ramcharan fan
Alia acting is too good
Nepotism produces bad products, that&#39;s true but not all nepotism products are bad. And that&#39;s also true. Alia Bhatt gave an outstanding performance in this movie, and her acting is usually something ig we all collectively can eulogise.
Make a movie about what you think of Kalbushan.  If this agency is so capable then why it is number 13 in the rank and why it is number one of ISI.
Vicky😍As Iqbal Sayed in the movie 🔥🔥🔥
amazing
There not come razzi movie
Desh apko hemasha yaad rakhega
One and only talented nepo kid actress Alia Bhatt

Salute to men and women who sacrificed so much for this great nation
India walon ne raw pe films bana bana k uska bera ghark Kar dia aur kisi ko kuch pata nahi ke ISI kaisay kam kerti hai yeahi wajha hai aaj Afghanistan mein ISI ki Hakoomat hai .....<br>Respect...
Vicky Kaushal kash sach main Pakistani hota! Khair chalo Pakistani play karna ka dhannewaad! ;)
Alia💗....  nepotism ke wajah se jitna vi troll karo lekin yeh inkar nhi kar sakte ki She is a talented actress of Bollywood...🌿.......   one of the best films of alia
Although I don&#39;t like her character that much but I can&#39;t deny that she&#39;s a very good actress
Is film u tube me full dekhne ki ichha rakhte he
Chemistry between Aliya and husband is superb
Emoji emoji emoji emoji emoji

In 1965 India🇮🇳 lost the war near United States Pakistan🇧🇩.  1971 United States Pakistan broken Pakistan civil war and bron Bangladesh 🇧🇩 and Pakistan 🇵🇰. But cowered and lier Bollywood never making movie upon 1965 war. Because the whole world known India lost the war near United States Pakistan.
Wonderful real sacrifice story 🎉🙏
So much Underrated <br>Very sad
Raajee

Haa bichari mein padhai ko interest nhi deti <br>Dumb hai<br>Silly bhi hai thodi pagal si hai magar dil ki saaf hai<br>Haa starkid hai par raazi mein usne yeh proof kar deya ki voh acting mein bhi smart hai<br>Abb har koi ko kya padna likhna ana chahiye yeh batao I don&#39;t know why people hate her

Nepotism to hai lekin sach mai alia bhatt achi actor hai🙄👍
Desh bhagat bhut ha
Sehmat came back to India to a royal red carpet welcome, saluted the tricolour while the military band played the National Anthem. Meghna removed the scene and instead brought her back in a depressed state, as if to show that a Kashmiri Muslim woman had done a mistake in fighting for her watan, India.”
kia pakistanio kay pass itna time tha k wo bilkul war say pahly india main nikah karny jain ?
Wow loved Alia in this movie
Alia..So proud of youu🥺🤍

What a film. Miraculous
This movie concept is very bad.... Heroin kills the innocent people&#39;s. Heroin cheats her husband for the country... Jung main sab Kuch jayej hai but why people make different between good and bad... The creator made this earth, men, women, everything and the people&#39;s made countries. So, We can&#39;t kill innocent peoples because we can&#39;t bring a life back.
Kya ladki hai ye
It feels painful that this girl gets trolled for her acting also... 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔

Alia ko karan johar ke alawa koi movie nahi deta kya
The only good product of nepotism these days doing good movies and proving herself.
Kashmiri people help India against Pakistan. Now Kashmiri getting reward from India.

I am also among those who hate Alia but when it comes to this movie,she has done a great job.♥️♥️
We should not forget that this is also a Dharma productions film but far better than SOTY.
To the all Indians, yes India helped Bangladesh. But Bangladeshis lost 3 million of people in the war. And lastly, India didn&#39;t send any Army in the warfield. They only attacked by plane at the last moment. Pakistani Armies surrendered infront of Mukti bangla Bahini. Don&#39;t try to modify the real history,  thanks.
Movie dekhna he pls
FULL MOVIE doheo razzi in hindi
boycott this alia
Boycott... Only boycott.
I am highly sceptical of this femme fatale movie.
The BEST ACTRESS OF HER GENERATION!Hate her, mock her troll her,but you can&#39;t ignore her!<br>She is just 27 and she has achieved so much !And it is all because she has worked her ass off for All her movies!Sp haters stop trolling her for no reason!!!<br>Lovee you Alia❤❤
Did someone just say &#39;talent&#39;.. coz I heard Alia?!  The acting she did in Raazi with less than 6 years of experience is one that no one can match with even 6 decades of experience. The world loves her, let&#39;s face it.. it&#39;s just that some of us show it like love &amp; some of us let it come across in the form of jealousy. She gets so many trolls, but never responds negatively ( but while keeping her self respect ). She gets so much love all day, but stays humble &amp; hardworking. Alia.. u truly r an inspiration. Thank you for being you my lifeline!!

I would like to know that if alia if a Hindu or Muslim in this movie
I felt she  looked more beautiful in this movie than any other movies of her❤️ 😀

Watan ke aage kuch nahi..... Best dialogue ever. Desh ki raksha ke liye jo karna pade karenge zaroor. Jai Hind 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳.
she is a poor actor, rest of the nepo kids are not even actors
We can hate her as a human being ( yes I do), hate her for being an overrated starkid, but we can&#39;t hate her for her acting, specially in raaazi❤️
Alia Bhatt as Sehmat is nowhere near the real agent Sehmat. Very bad character representation.
My story.
Are madherchod itta ghatiya movie weekend mai kyaa tatti dhak liye need liquor ek tho alia chutiyaa ki acting hor Bollywood ki purni kosis india ko nicha dhikana i.e i prefer Hollywood
donot ever say about pakistan
Where i can watch it guys ??
Movie is awesome yar. Moreover the acting of alia is mind blowing. Must watch this movie.
Flop
Not interested in seeing maheshbhatdaughter disgusting guys ...
Alia&#39;s acting was fab in this movie just loved it. Best movie and huge respect to the character sehmat
This movie is one of my most favorite movies 😇 . I loved Alia&#39;s acting ❤❤
The one who accepts criticism with her Beautiful smile and the way she behaves with everyone shows a lot about her character and not gonna comment on her acting skills cuz everyone knows how talented she is. Alia Bhatt that&#39;s it. <b>The name has enough talent in it</b>
If u think alia bhatt does good acting becoz she is starkid and she is getting good script? Then how much movie pooja bhatt got???
I take my like back 😊
Please rashi movie upload karo
Indian movies heros
Full move
Auuru8ht
Just admit...<br> it&#39;s a truth she is an amazing actress....acting skills should be rewarded ....
Alia is my favorite actress
Ek badhar ko jilla hai manthena quori Jada jathi Madi illana mansil po
Let&#39;s dislike this as well.
Ma ye movie dakhna chahtii hoo mgr mujha kahi ni mili koi bta sakta ha k ye movie or new Bollywood movies kaha available hai
The only movie in which Alia acted well is Raazi. She has overacted in all other movies
Boycott dharma production <br>And transgender karna joher
Alia might be a starkid . But she is not a bad child of nepotism. She is not in field because she has Mahesh bhatt or Johar.
this movie is reason no.1 out of 100 for why alia is an amazing actress and a really nice human who does not deserved to be trolled for one bad movie and a death that she had no link to. it might be true that she got here because of &quot;nepotism&quot; but one can really see her talent which I feel contributed more towards her success than the fact that she&#39;s mahesh bhatt&#39;s daughter. her performance in highway which was only her 2nd or 3rd movie was realistic and commendable. please stop trolling her just because a crazed opportunist and the &quot;flag bearer of bashing everyone more successful than themselves&quot; is making an easy target out of her. even though she&#39;s been publically shamed on twitter and media by said person she chose not to respond to it negatively and kept quiet. that shows a level of decency one must maintain especially during such times. it&#39;s not like she isn&#39;t voicing her opinions but at the same time she is not bashing anybody or doing any sort of name calling.
This was Alia&#39;s Good movie. Even though  Karan Johar is a <b>**</b>
Hum ne bhi to galti ki he sssr ki movie jese rabta ,kai po che or kai movie humne kahandekhi
Jaururi nhi ki sab ek jese hi ho kuch talented bhi hote h
People in the comments are very mature. It&#39;s not good to target and label someone for a conspiracy about which no one knows about. Alia is a fantastic actor and that&#39;s all that matters. And then there is Payal Rohatgi who is targeting people like Vicky Kaushal for no reason.! What a hypocrite she is. She never spoke about anyone before Sushant&#39;s death. What are your views on people like Payal Rohatgi who label people for no reason?<br><br>And remember on thing ...<br>If you try to boycott cinema, the economy of the country will go down badly. Because, many people are dependent on theatres  and film sets for their livelihood. So, that&#39;s like stealing someone&#39;s income.<br>Filmmakers put their heart and soul into making films like these, which are amazing. Do respect that ❤
Ye to GADAR EK PREM KATHA ki story hai bc
Alia and dharma production why always she is doing dhrama films koi aur movie nahi deta kai?
This movie is so amazing!!
Please guys don&#39;t dislike Alia Bhatt.She is such a great actress and super talented
To all the people supporting alia  like...saying that its not fair to hate her for what her father did.....like seriously!!!!<br>Let&#39;s get this right...if she(alia) is entitled to her father&#39;s riches and has advantage over others because she is bhatt&#39;s daughter..then she also deserves the blame for her father&#39;s deeds. <br>She came in industry because of her father&#39;s influence...then she will leave the industry because of her father&#39;s bad deeds ..THAT&#39;S CALLED KARMA.
Aby gandu logo har movie me Pakistan 🇵🇰 ko laate
People who said she was very good in raazi now nepo kid,talentless ....😌
Really this movie is amazing. I loved it soo much it has very meaningful message a good movie.
Really this movie is amazing and alia acting in this is incredible love u alia♥️♥️♥️
Raazi movie full bhejo Hindi movie Bollywood movie bhejo full movie
She did a very good acting in raazi film
Overacting Alia bat
Shameful to u Alia 👍
Alia don&#39;t act in any south movies I want to see rajamouli movie in the absence of Alia 👍do u agree with me guys
You changed the story
any1 know where i can watch this movie for free
Kangana is an opportunist! She just is using ssr for her own vendetta!  This had been confirmed by ssr&#39;s family lawyer that kangana is doing all this for her personal gain! Shame on you kangana!
There is a user in this comment section who has spoken bad about alia in every comment. How can people have that much time? The account is Aditi....
Liked the trailer just because it is the movie of Meghana Gulzar
I watched this movie today reluctantly at the start... <br><br><br><br><br>But i cried at the end!
Just tell me one place where there is no existence of nepotism. Its good to boycott Nepotism but you need to really admit that people like Ranbir and alia have talent. I was Sushant Rajputs fan and not the fan that have suddenly popped up. What I really know is that he was not an actor that would commit sucide cause of Alias comment.
I saw this movie last year. It&#39;s really fabulous and asweom script, screen play ▶ and so on, but the actress Ali batt she didn&#39;t act well y can they select another actress instead of Alia, it&#39;s because she has a long heritage with actress family tat not other actress have. It&#39;s Nepotism not fair 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Report the trailer.... These all are anti nationals
I read Dharma Productions and disliked. <br><br>Who did same? <br>⬇😂
Unlike karo
Alia bhatt is so talented don&#39;t know everyone why blaming her I know she is starkid
I am here to dislike this film after watching trailer of sadak2 ,just because of Alia Bhatt
Allia haramiii kuttiiyyaaa criminal gobbaarrr shakaal kiii maarjaaa nallliii m jaaa krr haramkhorr aslliiii bitch h tuuu
Is anyone here after sadak 2 trailer..🙃🙃😀😀
Who is here after watching the most disliked trailer in the world sadak 2. <br>Like here👇🏻
Abe e alia kab se acting karne lagaahe
People who are trolling Alia Bhatt mercilessly, did the police come all the way to your house knocking at your door telling that she is the murderer? We all want ssr to get justice but dragging people just because they are a product of nepotism is just baseless. If kangana cares about ssr so much why is it that she never appreciated him when he was alive?  Because alia did appreciate him when he was alive unlike that opportunist Kangana.
Han Bhosri ki pakistani army ko apni army jesa chutiya samjh rakha hai. Kashmiriyon ka gadar portray krke koi bada teer nahi mar liya BC tuney Alia Gandu
I just watched this movie...super...
Okay so Bangladesh did nothing?let me remind you the main war was between pakistan and Bangladesh.india just helped us a bit.millions of people in Bangladesh sacrificed their lives for this war.millions of women were raped.and now you make it look like the war was between pakistan and india?okay

<b>BINOD</b>
Varia is best couple
Ban alia bhat
Alia is a gem❤️ many starkids get flop after 1-2 movies but she is still here which proves something. I am a big SSR fan but just think that if he would be alive and had kids and his kids wanted to become an actor genuinely, won&#39;t they be starkids too? Problem is not about starkids, it is about who is undeserving. And genuinely Alia is deserving! Haa usko baakiyo se thoda asaani se mil gaya ek sab, lekin tike rehne me mehnat to lagti hai naa. More power to Alia, keep rocking✨
Randi ka movie
Baycott
Raazi, Highway, Dear Zindagi, Udta Punjab <br>Alia&#39;s acting ❤🔥
Who came after sadak 2 trailer 😠😡
Rip sushant
Boycott alia😕
So people who praised her in Raazi are now saying she isn&#39;t talented in Sadak 2
Someone who doesn&#39;t know the name of president of India gets to play the role of a national hero. This is the real face of Bollywood.
Buycott movie Mahesh Bhatt bhosdi ke
At this young age she had done such a great movies.. highway..udta panjab..dear Zindegi,raazi,2states...♥️
She proved herself Everytime...and some stupid people judging her just bcz of her family background..nd also others baseless nd nonsense opinion...
Log bhale hi alia ke khilaf hain nepotism ki wajah se lekin kuchh bhi ho wo talented to hai and she deserve awards for some movie.she acts also perfect.
Rashi movie upload karo
She’s so beautiful and super talented as an actress. And about Nepotism it’s human nature buddy like human works hard so that their kids have it easier
Yes alia is a talented actress. <br>Just because she is a star kid doesn&#39;t mean she is rude, non-talented. You can blame people like ananya pandey, sonakshi sinha, jhanvi etc., but not alia. <br>Even i love SSR. I hope we will justice. Guilty will be punished.
Indian lol...........
Pakistan zindabad
I don&#39;t like alia bhatt  fuck off
Imao. Did you seen how irritating Alia is. And she is an fan of Alia. And Alia is a nepotism product as well but you will respect her cause you are her fan and now she is well established in the industry. But don&#39;t forget how many chances Karan Johar gave her like she is his daughter SOTY<br><br>Humpty Sharma ki dulhania Kapoor and Sons<br><br>2 States ( Karan Johar as Producer ) Shaandar ( Dharma Productions) Dear Zindagi ( Karan Johar as<br><br>Producer )<br><br>Raazi ( Karan Johar and Hiroo Johar as<br><br>Producers )<br><br>And none less than Kalank ( Karan as Producer ). He gave so much limelight to Alia and if you saw Kalank, he cut so many scenes of Madhuri Dixit and gave those to Alia. He made Alia the centre of attention in the film. Apart from that he also gave Alia some cameos in his films like in Ae dil hai mushkil in the break up song and in SOTY 2 in the hook up song. Now if an actress would have got so many chances like these then anyone can become as popular as Alia.
To be very honest, I watched Raazi for Vicky Kaushal, but surprisingly Alia&#39;s acting was good in this movie. But look at her acting in other movies like Gully Boy for which she got a filmfare for her 10 sec role! This was her best movie in my opinion but she is taking up a place of another talented actress who could&#39;ve acted better than her. She just got here because of nepotism or else she wouldn&#39;t be here. She learned acting from her childhood as she knew she wanted to become an actor but still she&#39;s not the &quot;best&quot; actress... There are many other talented actors who are not recognized. The story is really good, other actresses may have acted better or like Alia it&#39;s not like she&#39;s perfect for the role....

Alia  stay strong . <br>No matter what is ur background ur acting is best.
When you have interest with your work and you have passion for your work then you turn out to give performance like Alia Bhatt√
Am I the only one who so badly wanted her to say to Iqbal, at least for once that she loved him? You can see that in her eyes when she turns back for the last time before getting into the car...but...😭💔
Alia Superb acting, the movie is good too😍😍
Alia❣️❣️as usual wining hearts💯❣️
Alia and Vicky both were splendid
Keep on disliking guys.
If u were my sis then I should give u so many slaps aliya all bihari now hates u all those does this type of mischief with sushant singh rajput from now don&#39;t dare to do with any one like u and many heros done with him

Boring movie
This movie is based on book written by Harinder Sikka and there is no mention of Muslim&#39;s and it is actually based on sikh girl. Why was the theme changed and climax distorted ??....to please pakistan ? Why are these entertainment jokers trying to build brand jihad and pakistan?  Meghna gulzar is big chor and even a traitor spreading lies, stealing credit of honest writers. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ssr">#SSR</a> these guys need to be isolated...
Best movie ever best actress ever 🖤
Great movie
I hope we have these kinds of movies in the Philippines. Great work, India!
Waw❤
Support and spread love to the ones who have talent and don&#39;t judge them bcuz of their background. Alia Bhatt has talent and she proves it in her every movie❤️
Personally I felt that after watching this story there are many soldiers sacrifices their married life and parents and children&#39;s but in india some people dont know what&#39;s going on in borders how they are sacrificing their lifes
I came here just to dislike this vedio
I will come just for dislike
I hate you alia bhatt yiu are the reason sushant singh rajout death
Dislike
Idk why people r blaming her.. see it&#39;s not important for everyone to be intelligent! As an actress I find her PERFECT! Yes I support anti nepotism, but people she is a human nd she got that talent! She is standing here cause she has the talent.. if only nepotism was there then she would be somewhere like sonakshi nd abhishek are!
I love Vicckkyyyy ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Alia Bhatt hum tumhare movies kavi nahi dekhenge..we unfollowed u
🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿FUCK oFF BollYWooD indUsTrY
Guys isse b ache actors h jinhe movies hi nhi milti Varna apna roll har actors ache se nibhate h par ye chutiye kisi ko moka de tab na inhone to saari movies pe apna naam likh rakha h kuki Inka baap Mahesh Bhatt or karna johar Jo betha h vha

Alia ki sarri movies dharma production se hi banti ha aur director ya producer karan hi hota han.
Please upload full movie
And what about sushant million times better
I dont even wanna see alia&#39;s face
Alia Bhatt I don&#39;t like her acting, I feel she is good for nothing. 👎
Alia ka talent h beauty h but iska mtlv ye nhi ki wo outsiders ko alag nazariye se dekhe shame on u alia
Faltu
dislike karo isko
Sherm to indian Hindu jo Muslim ko ache ger chamach te he......ar indian Muslim 💪💪
Alia is truly a talented actress but if we see her from the side of nepotism regarding Sushant&#39;s case her acting won&#39;t matter because a human is always being praised by his/her behaviour and good deeds but not by his/her profession.
Love her or hate her.....but man <br>SHE CAN ACT!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjMSttRJrhA&amp;t=60">1:00</a>
With all due respect,she deserves to be here .Even if she had not made her debut with soty or was not the daughter of Mahesh Bhatt,she could have become a very successful actress.Her acting skills prove that.Instead of mocking her mock those starkids who even after being in the industry for approx 5 years do not have  up to the mark acting skills(No that I hate  Sara ,but seriously Alia is alot better actress and look at lak2 .Sara was horrible.). She genuinely shuts trollers mouth with her phenomenal acting skills
Log jitna bhi troll kr le Alia ko but she is a good actor.
I really appreciated your work n films so much Alia Bhatt n had immense respect for u but knowing for the fact wat u did to sushant n things said about him n putting him down n forming a gang against him. U have lost the respect n will never watch your movies ever alia Bhatt. Never. We lost sushant singh rajput n u lost us forever. That&#39;s your loss n will be.
Mujay ya film kahi nahi mil rahi please please ager kasi ko pta haa tu  btay
An interesting fact to know:<br>The real life Iqbal didn&#39;t die..he is still alive. In the movie he died but in real life he came back after sehmat to protect her..
Madarchod bhosdi wale Teri Maa Ki Choot Teri movie ki poster toilet karunga Aaj Teri baje se ek talent kalakar Chala Gaya nepotism ko barabar dega bahan Chod gand Maar Dunga Tere picture ke Ham Sab Sushant Singh Rajput Sar Ke Sath Hai to bus release kar apni movi

Wonder how this will turn out.....tbh kinda sick of media playing pk and ind against each other when we have far more in common than different...and all want the same things for our families and countries...
Some foolish people r saying that she is not acting good...those people were praising her before...now her acting changed?no she is still a good actor...those foolish don&#39;t know meaning of supporting real talent...it means we have to support real talent whether it is of star kid or of outsider....alia is talented actress....

Who is she. She is not a good actor. Who&#39;s given the chance to act in the movie? Her acting is not well.
Bad movie
Someone just give Mr. Karan Kumar Johar a reality check,launch star kids I don&#39;t give a single fuck but make sure that you don&#39;t destroy the lives of upcoming self-made actors while you do it. Bollywood is a whole new world and you don&#39;t get to rule it ,you&#39;re just a fucked up gay producer who thinks he&#39;s the king
Its funny that everyone trolls her<br>Nd whenever her movie comes all are praising her<br>And after some time she gets trolled for being a starkid<br>Anyways she has proved herself every single time that she is the best
Alia is not a good actor because his supporting

الوفاء بالوطن
I regret the producer of the film and i also regret the actors who were satisfied with the representation of this film, which instills hatred between the two great peoples, the People of Pakistan and the Indian people.
A very bad movie because it provokes hatred between peoples and it is a political game between people in the name of the homeland and the victims of the heroic peoples of India and Pakistan are the two great countries with their peoples and not stupid politicians on both sides their only concern is to stay in the chair of government
Bad film

One thing is cleared both countries dont want war to be happen and want only peace.
I write this poem as a substitute for baba me teri gudiya song<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wzhbzxBAu0">https://youtu.be/-wzhbzxBAu0</a><br><br>Watch it once
Lol ..India k fazool  stories
Sab INDIAN LARKIAN  shadi krlo Pakistani k sath 🤣😂🤣
I became fan of sehmat nd really appreciate her. thing which is teasing me was her father&#39;s decision to send her daughter to Pakistan. If someone in that country came to know her intentions the situation could be worse than death especially for a woman. May be i m wrong nd i m sorry if i m bt i think he did this for money nd if he did not send her for money then plz let me know
I think if Sehmat saw what  Modi rajniti and islamophobia is doing to Muslims in India,  She wouldn&#39;t stand for India!
Plz full movie uploade
That hurt so much...It was painful to watch... Lots of innocent people got dragged into a war between 2 countries/religions....I felt really bad for Iqbal, he had such a good character. I also felt bad for sehmaat, she was stuck in an internal conflict ... and all of it happened because of her blind ass father. Honestly speaking, I think that the separation never should have happened, many innocent muslims died in it. Loved ones got separated from one another. In the end, we are all the same...This made me so emotional lol.
Watan ki aage kuch bi nehi💓💓💓💓

Our kaaf kangna is much better than this..❤<br>Iska to trailer dekh k e hnsi arhi h😂😂😂😂

Kangana Ranaut would have been good choice for this character
Sahi bat ha hamra ithas ma aisa kya log ha jinha

Why nobody tells the untold story of kashmir?
&quot;Nothing comes before the country. Not even yourself.&quot; MAN that hurts 😰😭😰😭
So hard  to be a spy , horrible, need so big heart
Salute Indian force
When i saw student of year that time I thought she is here becoz of her father but when i saw udta punjab i change my mind she is dam good ..  she is better then kareena kapoor
who is watching this after watching the trailer of chhapaak...
Raazi movie
Salo jasos wali movies banaty ho phir kahty ho phir real main bhi aisa he krty ho I hate like this movies
IF IT IS TRUE... YOU KNOW MY ANSWER..!!!
india has no solid proof that this story is either true or false so i dont tnink so that bollywood or the maker of this film have to produce this film .and if they do so dont add &quot;based on real incident&quot;.bcz u didnt know who is she and did  she or iqbal tell u the story or the chief of RAW...!!!!!!!!!!!
india mera lund chusso bhenchoddou...chupp ker gussne wale maader chudd indians choddou....kulghoshan yadav bhi gandu chupp ker ghussa tha PAKISTAN main....chodd diya gandu ko
This is a masterpiece every other directors  think that&quot; I should have made it&quot;. What an extraordinary narration and Alia performance. This movie will be master piece for ever.<br><br>Thanks Raazi Team for producing such a wonderful movie. For me it is a top 1 movie of decade.<br><br>Common commercial directors its time to change.We want such good movies.
Türkçe bilen yok mu film nasil
How can a friend betray other friend...I&#39;m an indian..but i don&#39;t like him who betrays pakistan friend

It is not a good film
One of the shittiest movie I ever watched. Trying to portray RAW in negativity while ISI as good. No mention of the genocide of bangalis.

Lol😂
Lol😂
राजी फुल मुवी दिखाओ तो माने
Bucky kusal baler actor
entrying in army or cantonment area in Pakistani ARMY area , is impossible , <br>indian agent entered in pak army brigadier as a father friend ! <br>extremly wrongly portrait pakistan , pakistan is not what is portrayed in this movie  ...
First thing I dont understand why did she had to spy in pakistan for India when Bangladesh was not India&#39;s problem, pakistan was not attacking india in 1971, india interfered in pakistan, the information she passed to india was nothing security risk for india
Loved this movie
I like Alia
India pakistan mudda bahut jyada pechida hai

Who else watch the trailer after watching the movie to know that what the hell they have shown in the fucking trailer👍
Movie link plzzz
faltu movie
I felt sorry for iqbaal.
What is happening to Pakistan and India is England&#39;s fault! There was a lot in the history of these two countries... they were one country, but England invaded, ruled for many years and pitted people, and then completely tore the country into two warring parts.... and now the United States intervenes in these relations, it&#39;s all very sad, because Pakistan and India have a common centuries-old history...  I would very much like to wish Pakistan and India, if not to unite, at least to stop feuding and look for ways of friendship and mutual assistance. There is nothing good in enmity, only the pain and suffering of innocent people!
Besharam log pakistan ke khilaaf movies bnate hain issi liye flop ho rahi hain.
very funny plot,  Pak Military dont allow marriages with foreigners while this is about Indian wife. You people not know security checks. Lack of research movies as always. making fool to your public .. remember 27 Feb always when we paralyzed your forces. and your joker Kalbushan.
Best film ka award mila
Who&#39;s here after IIFA declared <br>Best Actor Female 2019: Alia bhatt
I don&#39;t watch Bollywood much but i watched this movie yesterday and the movie is epic! it shows the great patriotism from both side of the countries and salute to all those heroes from both the countries who gave their lives so others cud live.
Beshomaar Lanat Jo apny Mulk Ka na Ho ska
Be proud I am pakistani not Indian🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Expression less alia, even she was far better in highway and udta punjab, but in raazi she carry out her acting in a very casual way...... But the story is a mine ore, outstanding meghna gulzar, infact tapsee would be the best choice for raazi as she is the most realistic actress in now a days generation, jai hind🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🙏🙏🙏🙏
Alia bhatt  is a British citizen
ये साले हिंदुस्तान पाकिस्तान करके लोगों के मन में खाई पैदा करते है  ओर खुद पैसा कमाते है।
Alia bhatt is a brilliant actress... so cutieee with powerful acting 😍😍😍.. I love alia after deepika &amp; anushka 😘😘😘
the moral message of this film is to stop the war because so many innocent lives have fallen victim. many relationships and lives damaged by war
Full movie plz
only on pishab pine wale hindu koom movie bana skte ho bus or koch nhi😜🤣
The movie has really justified with the contents of the book. Even though the later part of her life is not mentioned in the movie but still its a masterpiece
why do not have sound?
Guys1 why should she live like a beger at end! government should give her mansion for her work and sacrifices
Bollywood loves to make fantasy movies abt Pakistan but their homework is extremely poor! They know nothing abt Pakistan, it&#39;s culture and the people.
India waly sirf movie&#39;s hu bna sakty hain.
Please upload full movie
Jab bhi banana pakistan ke against hi banate ho
At least don&#39;t show such scenes in these patriotic movies ! You directors, producers, and actors all are just same!
Proud to have an actress like alia bhatt
I love Pakistan.. Pakistan zinda Bad❤️
You are bad
Kamini
Alia did a great job we all know but Vicky he also did a great job. He portrayed his love for Sehmat as a husband and when it was time we could see his loyalty and love for his country. Absolutely loved Iqbal and sehmat’s characters and their love story. It made me cry a lot
Watan word hi urdu ka ha or kia bolo
Raazi full movie upload pliz
I am in love with this movie but i want to say nobody want war. War bring nothing except destruction to both country. In war we lost our loved one from both sides. If our politicians are really loyal to our country so why they don&#39;t send their childrens to army for war. Our politicians are too coward and selfish they bring negativity in both nations. So please stop hating each other. Love from another side of border Pakistan😊
Please razzi  full movie upload koren please
Plz anyone give me this movie link🙄
Nice nice  film👏👏
Very nice movie...love it....

I think we should not judge anyone by their country and religion... before taking action we should confirm all the things and we should improve our relation.....
Plz upload the youtube
Movie story line and acting of actors is really good. I wish even small fraction of such story happens in real Kashmir! Looking at today&#39;s Kashmir, I want to find &quot;one&quot; Kashmiri local leader says &quot;India First&quot;. Not &quot;Islam first&quot;! I can challenge, you will not find any!! This story is just a fiction. It It is to keep rest of the India in innocent sweet dreams, a Kashmiri will say &quot;India first&quot;.

Allied.
Amazing acting by both of them. By far this was both their best performances. Hope to see more roles like this for alia🧡
Vicky kaushal is the best. No one can act like him. I literally felt like to cry when he died in the movie
Jao bhadavo Pakistan hi chale jao aesi movie banate ho saram nahi ayi tum ko to hum bheje nge Pakistan fir pata chalega kitna achha he Pakistan. Gay Karan ka to Sab milke rape karenge vaha

Love and respect from Bangladesh for this great movie as well as the sacrifice she did.<br>We r really grateful.
Average movie
How do I watch the whole movie
Worst movie ever!<br>You insulted Bangladesh!
Bullshit
@Dharma Productions: Pls make movie on 27 Feb 2019 event! Movie cast would be &quot;Abhinandan&quot;, &quot;Modi&quot;, and Indian Media:).... and pls try your last to &quot;portray&quot; that indian air force did their best on that event:) hahahah.....you can do nothing but, face saving through movies.. nothing more than that....
Alia bhat❤❤❤ , i m become her fan after watching this move,  brilliant role and performance
india bs dokhy se e jeet sakta hai . bht bad story hai is ki larki ka galt istmal kia gya h or muslim kabhi b apny rishton ko dokha ni dety ....
a good msg delivered by this movie  at the end. but everyone understand it
wat a movie mind blowing superb..after so many years bollywood came up with this type of fantastic film..and alia u were superb out standing..
So cheap
I love you Pakistan 🇵🇰
I saw the movie raazi recently but I don&#39;t think I saw the scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjMSttRJrhA&amp;t=57">0:57</a> in the film
These patriotic movies need to stop. How are we gonna move forward if we keep clinging to the past.
what the hell is this I came for boobs
Bohat Hi bakvas movie h meny dekhi thi duniya ki sab sy gatiya tareen movie na koi stori na koi tareka movie banany ka
Aatma ram thank God that India have wise people like u otherwise many Indians hate Pakistan.Good and evil is everywhere in this world  we can not alligate just one nation or country as terrorist.pakistan is peace loving country and we r against terrorism and violence.pakistan Zindabaad.
I don&#39;t understand why patriotism has to be depicted as hatred for another country... I believe that we can still remain patriot by loving our countries and not by hating each other... Love your country and respect your neighboring countries... enough of hate... must live all in peace... Love from Pakistan...
Who&#39;s the deshatgard now? Huh lol
You all don&#39;t make movies just take care of Abhinandan and ask him how was the tea is Pakistan
Kangna is best for this role
not really a fan of alia&#39;s persona but her acting is great
Kanjhroun apni kanjhriyan pakistan m bhjou ge....humary bistar garm Karne wali tum logo ki undercover agents...ghaleez kaum ho
This movie is so sad.. FUCK war. I am not Indian neither Pakistani, but or even for my country I wouldn&#39;t have do such thing.. They destroyed her life and she destroyed another family&#39;s life.. she is alive but dead. FUCK WAR 😭😭😭
Super

After watching Uri, i wanted to see more movies of Vicky Kaushal because he acts so wonderful but he ain&#39;t the main actor in this movie:(
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 i see this movie bohat funny ha India go Kuch real ma ni kr skta wo sb is film ma ha hahahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂
Iss movie a black spot of bollywood because iss movie pakistan ko victim aur hume mujrim bataya gaya hai.
Nice videos

You all don&#39;t make movies just take care of Abhinandan and ask him how was the tea in Pakistan.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pakistanzindabad">#PakistanZindabad</a>
Love from Bangladesh to Aliya
Raazi move lonch kijia
when it will come on youtube?
This movie is against pakistan why??? At least Pakistan does not spread hatred
MC Bollywood don&#39;t find any story except Muslim and Pakistan<br>That&#39;s why ur Bollywood industry decrease day by day
Looks like a tragic ending already! Is it still worth a watch? We all know the main ship can&#39;t come out of this happily especially if it is a true story. I am picturing a Finnick and Annie esque ending along the lines of Gu Family Book
I think katrina kaif would have give a better performance
Im from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bangladesh">#Bangladesh</a> .In the end of this movie you saw India won this war in 1971 . So who the fuck  we Are ??who is your dad ?dont  forget it that India just helped us i 71 nothing else. you can say We Won or your country helped us bitch .Dont show like you Did war with PAk in 71 son of bitch.
I really feel sorry after reading some comments down below. Really feeling happy for winning a war or 2 or 3?? Laughing at someone because you won two wars and they won  1?? It&#39;s war guys. No winners only losers,only losses only pain and tears only doubt and fears. Life is so much better with tolerance, love respect trust and safety.. Don&#39;t be proud of war be sorry for humanity&#39;s pain. There are children here and there and they want love not blood, they deserve dreams not fears. God bless us all.
INDIANS can fight in movies only....Love PAKISTAN
Watan ke aage kuch nahi <br>Khud bhi nahi
She actually deserves a national award for this  movie. Kudos to her fine acting and yes she is beyond Deepika and Katrina. <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23alia">#Alia</a><br>😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Bollywood king Alia Bhatt
Please do not make movies like this.
In one scene in movie alia goes in the funeral.but as far I know muslim women are not allowed to go in graveyard
Who&#39;s here after Alia won the best actress popular for this role😍❤
1965 ka attack yaad ha India us pr banao movie India bhi galat ha bohat jagha ha aur Pakistan bhi fazool Mai logo Mai nafrat na Palo aisi movies bana kr Hate form Pakistan
Ap logo ne aase hi Pakistani ko badnam kiya hiwa hy . Yeh sb ap khud karte hu Pakistan  k sth
Congratulation for alia and raazi, for wining filmfare awards, anyone agree with me?
Just don’t believe that an actual Kashmir especially from Jammu would willingly help Indian after the the oppression of Kashmiris.
Alia&#39;s not amateur anymore
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7hFLStgDlw">https://youtu.be/Q7hFLStgDlw</a>

I wish i could see her real photo and know her actual name ....
I love all films of Alia bhatt even this
All India can do just in Bollywood. It&#39;s a mythical story made by Indian.
Most trolled actor but everyone shuts up when her movie comes out
Worst movie👎👎

What a performance by Vicky koushal. I didn&#39;t see Vicky in this film. I saw only Iqbal. Award winning performance by Vicky and Alia.
This is the best movie. There&#39;s no nonsense over emotional drama to create a theme. Just a straight forward story with mind-blowing acting of Alia Bhatt, Vicky kaushal &amp; all the other supporting casts. Love love loved it!! Proud of all those unknown heroes who sacrificed everything for our country ❤ Jai Hind ❤🙌

I think Bohaat Saray Log Fan Hain Pakistan Se Indians Actors and Actress ke Phir Aisi 2Rupe Ki Films Bana Kar Kiya Sabit Karna Chahte Matlab Pakistan Itna Kamzoor Hai Ke Aik Larki Aajati Hai Shadi kar ke Aur Sara Kam Kar ke Wapis Chali Jati Hai :D Is Per Toh Mujhe Bus Chutiya Word Hi Ata Hai..  Aur Lannat Hai Aisi Soch Per Jo Hum Toh Chahte hi Nahi Hain Ke India ka Koi Nuksan Ho Hum Apne Azad Mulk Mein Achi Sans Lena Chahte Hain Ap Apne Mulk mein Lo.

Super movie
Kya moviee hai... scrifice for our country.....
I just saw this movie and I do think she showed a great amount bravery, something extremely hard to possess. But I still feel our armies have crossed too many lines. I feel there is no honour in what she has done, these armies destroyed this family, killed an innocent guy who was not even a soldier:(  I feel so sick to my stomach what war calls great sacrfrice and honour:&#39;( I feel the &quot;honour&quot; people are so proud of is masking an evil. Soldiers fighting soldiers is terrible as it is, but that is a little more understandable  because it comes with this line of work. But this type of manipulation with families and governments, and above all, killing innocent people is criminal and disgusting😡 armies shouldn&#39;t do everything they want to win a war, just like police officers can&#39;t do everything they please; they need to have limits otherwise they are not protecting us but hurting us.
Aaliya...
Remembering Sehmat on this Republic Day. We will always be grateful to this brave and dedicated Indian Women.

Watched this awesome movie. As an Indian I don&#39;t like the blast scene on public in Pakistan from Indian side. The issue here is whether exploding a grenade in a market place among civilians is not a terrorist act, and if the act is not being justified because it is on behalf of India? Could not Ajmal Qasab’s handlers have used a similar argument with him when they sent him out to Mumbai? Terrorism is dastardly because its kills innocents, not because Indians are the victims.
Jis thaliiii may khaty hn usi may chaid krty hn yh indin . Piyar k kabil ni hn yah log inhay serf dhoka Dyna ATA h . Pakistan is one of best country in the world .🇵🇰 Pakistan zindabad  Jung Samny say lari jati h mardou k 7 India ourat ka Sahara lyta h busdil namard .
Its good to see that muslim in india is so open minded for not covering up some scene like kissing or bed scenes. In other country its not acceptable , but if you’re doing masterpiece like this. There will always be an exemption. Good job, from 2states movie to This one. She’s really good! Level up acting. More to come baby girl. - Love from the Philippines.

And still watching in 2019...
Vicky kaushal...😍😍😍😍😍💖😘😘
Flop :(
the war was won by &quot;bangladeshi mukti shenas&quot; and the war ended in 16th december,1971. Indian army helped Bangladeshis from december  but the war started at 26th march, 1971 . so please tell me how you assholes are saying that india won the war??? chutiya movie
If India hate Pakistan please don&#39;t include
Masterpiece man , amazing, don&#39;t av words to express, i m full of emotions, gratitude, patriotism not able to sleep
Watan Ke Agay Insaaf Bhi Nahe: Indian Ideology!
after seeing her in udtaa punjab i was impressed. after seeing this movie hats off to her !!! what fine actinggggg. especially in the ending of trhe movie where she cries about going back home. wow. defintely need to be a recipnt for all highest form of awards
Just finished watching this movie, super acting by alia bhatt and thanks to India for helping Bangladesh :)
I think the film maker should stop making films like this where stories are based on India and Pakistan fight. These film keep reminding of the dispute between two country to the youth and I feel like it’s kinda of brand wasted or trying raise a patriotic in these youth. Every one wants to love happy life and forget about the mistake that happen. Idk why these film maker keep being up the old wounds.
No kashmiri girl can do this

Alia has proved that Nepotism won&#39;t hurt anyone if the actor is good
What a ridiculous storyline! An Indian Muslim ruining her life to act as spy in Pakistan!!!!
Since when a kashmiri Muslim had a sense of nationalism towards india. What a joke this is. Just creating false images through movies
Any sensible Indian will be demoralised watching this movie.
can anyone translate this trailer into english please?

Those who say nepotism exist in Bollywood must watch highway , Raazi, Udta Punjab then you would understand why it is necessary... If there would not be nepotism you won&#39;t get higly talented actors like Alia, shraddha Kapoor, Ranbir Kapoor and many more... Nepotism may help them in getting launched but only talent will make them survive... And those who have talent they find their way at their own...  Such examples are available in every field.... Rahul Roy had no god father and he got dream start but cudnt sustained due to his limited abilities where as Akshay, Sharukh Khan, kangana, Nawazuddin , irrfan made their ways to stardom due to talent and good choices of script... So pls stop blaming nepotism if you are not able to make your way... people who have courage and talent make their own ways.... Excellent Alia...
This shows that India sends agents to Pakistan to plant terrorism in our country for example the most recent Kulbushan Yadav who helped terrorists in Balochistan. Then Shushma Swaraj accuses Pakistan in UN that it&#39;s the only terrorists promoting country in the world. Pehle khud Apne gireban me jhank ke Dekho phir bolo.
HAHAHAHA

Best movie of  a spy
In 1971, the war was between Pakistan vs Bangladesh. Not india vs Pakistan. It&#39;s true India helped us but finishing time....
Hahahah,seriously. What a joke
Proud to be Pakistani
Alia takes her acting in a next level.... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23modified">#Modified</a> alia
Pakistan zindabad hamy 💖hai Pakistan se
Saw the movie just now and was really heartbroken how war and enmity between nations destroy lives, relations, love and anything which is close to human values. Its not that one person or group of person are involved in any mishap but the whole of the community, nation is responsible for any lives lost in the name of war. Its a chain reaction which leads to the unfolding of events. And when a chain gets stronger. destruction ensues. We have to try as a whole that, that chain never gets strong enough. And gets weakened day in and day out. War will never stop. History is full of them and future will be also full of them . Its upto us to see will the history repeat itself. Its the collective human consciousness that can change that psyche and ignite that flame that burns all that is filth but again this also have to be a chain process and it has never happened till now since the dawn of the universe. Wish some day that time comes. <br>Be it Pakistan or India all are made of the same elements. People abuse each other even on the virtual platform without even thinking what is compelling them to do so. Its like one programmed machine talking to the other. They speak of destroying each other as if its some video games where life doesn&#39;t matter at all. Ask the family whose son, father, mother or sister is dead, then speak of such idiotic phrases; ask a family who suffered in hiroshima; ask the soldier who goes for war because You want the destruction of the other country, its as if these soldiers are your household servant and their lives doesn&#39;t matter; you will sit in your cozy sofa and fantasize our soldiers killing other. When people to people interaction between two countries is friendly and full of respect no politician has the guts to call for war. These things people don&#39;t understand. But when war is the last resort go with full force as its the dharma of one country to protect itself at all cost. But its also the dharma of a human being to be human at all cost at the first place. Some people will understand what I want to convey and some will scratch the article to its core to point out I am an Idiot. This movie ignited the feeling which I wrote here. Before I too would curse a pakistani and would want them to be completely wiped off! But again we have to ask what we are and who we are to think of such things. Can&#39;t we try the other way round as we are but one son of God; a human being at the end of the day. Its true some people are like shakuni to their core who would want the war and hatred to be brewing at all cost but we also have krishna inside ourselves who would want things take a different route altogether. But human psyche is such that even krishna couldn&#39;t dissuade them from war because as krishna said humans have free will, they are not puppets whose strings are controlled by someone above, I can only show the right path and its upto them to follow or not because at the end of the day what you sow, so you reap. So we should as a whole try our best to be collective responsible and inculcate divine providence in ourselves. As things start with a thought, then words and then its action. And lastly &quot;Its only words and words that all I have, to take your heart away to take your heart away!&quot; -Boyzone song!<br>Take care

dharma production wali bro...5 hours laga kai aik movie Raazi Full Movie 2018 Upload Ki Thi..us pai bi copywrite claim de dya..plz muj sai conversation kar lain agar messege par lo..
Treat every indian as same if you want them to feel indian
I felt sad during the climax of the movie. Sehmat really did loved Iqbal and we loved him too.. This movie actually portrayed both country&#39;s patriotism and as they say Nation comes first.. We all sympathised with the pakistan family and also with Sehmat. Movies like this does bring out the good in pakistan too.. <br>And it makes people realise that Pakistan is not full of terrorists and also we have to remember that  India is not full of good ones..It all comes down to what a person you are. We can never judge someone based on their country, their religion, their parents. We can only judge someone based on their character..<br>Hats off to the makers of this film☺️<br><br>PS: Edited seeing the comments as to I spoiled the movie for some. <br>I sincerely apologize for that.
hii

I don&#39;t know if it is real story or not but India could not able to stop Pakistan if INS Vikrant successfully targeted by the PNS Gazi, because, India actually terminated their naval warships and heavily damaged their Karachi harbor, because PNS Gazi unsucceeded in its task.<br>And it was impossible without spying over Pakistani&#39;s defense activities.<br><br>So, hats off to her... Who did this for her country.
this is why we need women directors. good stories told in an engaging way, just enough of chemistry, suspense, and action. truly lovely cast and production.
Pakistan ko in kay hatoo badnaam karva looo vahi kaam hai indians kay paas u should also make movies on friendship stories
A vatn mere vatn abeed rhe tu 5 star bhi <a href="http://km.hai.is/">km.hai.is</a> movie k liye
Waisy &quot;Incredible True Story Likhaa hai&quot; Trailer Mai....  Real Mai ess k husband ko pata chalny k baad ess ko or ess ki poory team ko arrest kr lia gia thaa....  I dont know rest that they exicuted her or what, but she was caught which was not shown in this movie cuz that would be against india maybe....
Thoese who believe this is a true story have been made chutiya, go learn the reality, and first reality which everyone’s in the world even indians know that Kashmiris hate indian they are Muslim first and Pakistani second, only thoese Muslim show patriotism to India who are in film industry, cause wahin ka khate hain, here is the truth <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7lffHcyQJw">https://youtu.be/m7lffHcyQJw</a> , raazi should be nominated for joke of the year movie, jiss ne indians ko bewakoof banaya 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ranbeer">#Ranbeer</a> Tu chala gaya Our isku <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dhagadhag">#DhagaDhag</a> Karna pada.... !!!! 😬😇😂😂
this movie is the joke of the year, away from reality and truth. Everyone knows including indians and kashmiris that they are not indian but were and always consider them selves muslim, or secondly pakistani. they hate india hence the riots and stuff. they always take sides with pakistan, and will always do. Indians can never swallow the harsh truth so make bullshit films like this. LOOOOOOLLL im dead this was a joke of a film. a comedy i would say XDDD
dosti dosti ka raag alapny waly hindus shame on you.<br>phir kehty ho pakistan aesa paistan wesa.<br>every one say with me Pakistan Zindabad(hai,tha or rahe ga).<br>INSHALLAH

Filme maravilhoso!!!👏👏👏 Alia 🏆
Don&#39;t you think Alia is over rated? Karan Johar promoting Alia everywhere?

The war was between Bangladesh and Pakistan.<br>Not India vs Pakistan. This war was won by the sacrifice of our freedom fighters , around 3 million people died in the war , we appreciate you guys, you helped us during our war ,that do not means you won that war for us. So stop telling that it was your war.
Alia please your flim tamil dup panni acting pannu
