Hablas de discriminación y racismo más sin embargo actúas como alguien racista y descriminativa que solamente medio reaccionó ante la tragedia de sú hermana y eres rápida a juzgar, y vienes de una familia con poder económico que realmente no conoces la pobreza porque no la haz experimentado, durante la presidencia de Trump hubieron menos deportados que durante Obama y mucho menos racismo, infórmese mejor y mejore su ponencia
We are  reached to be long way who wants to be learned  English let me know ASAP
shes pretty hot
Motivational videos don&#39;t have Motivation 😅
اتمنى ان يتم الترجمة الى اللغة العربية

Svrha Amerike je biti dom svih ljudi na planetu koji to žele, bez obzira na razlike. Zašto? Zato što su kolonizatori uništili cijele civilizacije novog svijeta. To je dug kojega SAD i Kanada, kao superiorne civilizacije, imaju naspram svih &quot;drugačijih&quot;.
I just came here to learn English because I am new in United States but I am learning a lot of lessons about life too.<br>Thanks TDEX
@user-ec9
thank you for the sincere and heartfelt emotional narrative about wanting to be disappointed, a story of hope for those who have come through hardship and succeeded. I agree with his wish that nothing negative should be thought about anywhere in his speech.
So crazy that your first summer camp you went to was Brainerd, MN, that is where I grew up.
I really like Mariana&#39;s story. She is an example for everyone. Her speech is really amazing.
Anyone in 2024
Mariana you didn&#39;t know how to speak about other religions followers if you are much bold its in your culture,she is quite safe with gaon 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
fake news
excellent ❤❤❤❤
IS THAT ONLY ME WHO FILLED MY EYE AND HEART WHILE SHE TALKS?
Nice speech I just came here to brush up my listening skills. U really nailed it wonderful 💯
genial❤❤❤
I think, listening is the most important practice to learn English and improve speaking skills 🎧  I highly recommend short stories for learning English. Thanks for the great tips 👍❤
I really love this channel.
Who is here from @Khadizatun Sonya&#39;s video?
She really beautiful
Thank you JESUS AMEN 🙏
Your life story is inspiring.
Difference are edifice of the development and destruction that human have done for human fellows.
If you&#39;re avoidant, <br>you most likely have said to family members who had a major role in your childhood: <br>&quot;You only accepted me or liked me when I was happy/obedient/emotionless.&quot; <br>This one simple statement fits with ALL the core symptoms of avoidant attachment: <br><br>1. Being overly self-reliant <br>(and in doing so, you hide your needs, emotions, problems, and acute illnesses)<br><br>2. Pushing down anger until it explodes <br>and manufactures the boundaries you crave but can&#39;t ask for<br><br>3. Not wanting to burden others <br><br>4. Wanting to fix your own issues <br>to avoid looking incompetent or even getting bullied/teased<br><br>5. Numbing out emotions with self-soothing behaviors <br>that are either totally unhealthy or pseudo-healthy <br>(like getting addicted to working out and healthy eating)
This is a great presentation. Discovering what makes you special involves self-reflection, exploration, and understanding your unique qualities. There is no shortcut to it

I will learn English propearly. Insah allah😊
Excellent speech! Amazing!
Hi Dr Eric<br>Love your content. A little request, can you please make a video on I.F. from a muscle building perspective, like how it helps in muscle building, recovery etc
&quot;Being able to reimagine yourself beyond what other people&#39;s see ,that is the toughest task of all, but it also the most beautiful &quot;<br>&quot;The single thing every one of us has in common is being human&quot;<br>thease are the most meaningful line for me💗😌😌🥺🥺💖💖
Beautiful speech, I feel so happy for you and your sister.
Nothing. No one is anything special. The only thing close to special are the talented like Elvis who can sing and do something that people love and cherish them personally for. Friends and colleagues and partners come and go, but the favorite artist is for life.
Wish I had seen this earlier and  I could have taken this class at my school.
I only cane here to learn English then i also learned a incredible lesson of my life
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Niceee
.
Since when is Ted talks political? What other countries allow illegal immigrants? This is disappointing, she could have made the same point without making it political... illegal immigration isn&#39;t about being different
@@@hello👍  special very nice
Great speech
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
O QUE PENSO DE VOCÊ E O QUE VOCÊ PENSA DE MIM INFLUENCIA NO QUE PENSAMOS .<br>MUITO OBRIGADO PELO QUE VOCÊ PENSA DE MIM ?🇧🇷
Illegal immigrants are illegal and not welcome.
what makes you special is for example to respect the NATIVE languages and cultures when we migrate.When  people speak languages for genocide purposes like all the spanish speakers does worldwide, it makes you a greed sad person willing to lie to everyone.<br>Because being a spanish speakers means that you were FORCED TO ABANDON YOUR OWN LANGUAGE.
Beautiful soul and challenging journey.  Every teenager should hear this story.  Thank you for sharing
❤❤❤❤
that&#39;s great
pretty speech
Beautiful in her appearance as well as in personality.

Now that&#39;s a &amp;*$#%$@#$# Ted Talk
😮😮What should I start with in order to learn English fluently?
How long did it take you to learn to speak English perfectly?
My highlights: The part where she was dancing and singing Shakira. The photo with the 7-year-old girl who had already learned she was “the other.” The palpable relief in the audience when she reported her sister’s full recovery or regaining the ability to walk.

Una buena charla, estropeada por una traducción nefasta. (al menos la locución)
great speech by heart
that is simply amazing
I subscribed the channel on purpose of learn English
wooww no words😍
This is an amazing Ted Talk and one of the best speeches I&#39;ve ever heard in my life! I completely agree, and I think everyone should think this way. If we all do, then the world will be a much better place!
Jessie Smith Karla
This is what I wanna heared since two years...!
Can anybody tell me the summary of this..
Great speech 👏👏
good
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=452">7:32</a> I was sitting at my desk doing my own I was closely listening to her too! And when she said to take a piece of paper and write down the things that makes you different and I wrote the things that I think makes me different and how I friendly I&#39;m to people around me accepting my own flaws pointed out by them in a cheerful way! Embracing their lifestyle and qualities! Appreciating real art and indulging in true art. When I again began with the video whatever she said on being proud on whatever you wrote was already written down by me on that piece of paper. And somehow it made my day!! Thank you Mariana(aa) 🤍
his dad is hero
Beautiful talk ❤️
What makes you a special little snowflake.... by Generation Z.
Awesome
So nice an beatiful lesson ❤
all different great speech
❤
Solo veo una persona que habla ver lo que ella ha hecho, pero no reconoce lo que su familia o el país que la recibió o sus amigos o sus profesores etcétera hicieron por ella. No reconoce que hay alguien más que hace algo por nosotros ni mucho menos reconoce que hay un ser supremo que nos tiene donde hoy día estamos parados.
I remember that when I was a child, my school mates and I were raised with this phrase &quot;We all are equal&quot; then, when I was like 24, I had a conference at work about handicap people and they told us &quot;We all are different, we are not equal, and that is ok&quot;. That was mind-blowing and changed my POV.
Great speech 🎉.
As a illegal immigrants from china, now I&#39;m the difference, the special, the others,and I&#39;m very grateful for the message of lady share to us
I&#39;m oyster from sylhet Bangladesh
I want to thank you for a few very valuable lessons you thouth me.<br>Number 1:<br>&quot;The only thing that every one of us has in common is being human&quot; that sentence gave me sensebility about the others. There is no me and the others, there&#39;s us.<br>That gave me the ability to see the other from his perspective and from his wants and from his needs. Another part of it was &quot;being different also means thinking differently&quot;<br>Number 2:<br>&quot;There are differences that simply sucks, but you can&#39;t let those differences define you&quot;.<br>It helped me accept the good and the bad within me, and so when people try to talk me down i see the good within the bad.<br>Number 3:<br>&quot;The importance of putting myself in other people shoes&quot;<br>That way i can understand people with more easy and more effective.<br><br>and on and on and on.<br>Thank you so much🙏.
She is terribly a beauty.
The only thing we all have common is being human. So stand for the rights of humans in Palestine.
Beautifully spoken!!<br>🙏🙏🙏
They were recognizing patterns. That one doesn&#39;t belong with these ones.
When you recorder this you were 33 years old ,at age seven it was 1991. there was no instagram or snapchat that time ...correct you statement before advising people here
Hello there ❤
I just come here leran English fast like that
I came here for listening and learn English
&lt; 3
I am watching only to improve my English Speaking 🗣️🗣️
But Fatima is still special that you are naming her repeatedly
Muslim girls are shy and committed better than u American guys
Wow, Mariana was pretty cruel with that Fatima girl. Who&#39;d tell that behind that nice smile and pleasant accent there&#39;s a cold-hearted little beyotch
i have autism
hot dog
Wow 😊this was amazing
😊 thanks
Hearing this speech makes me think of how I should view the world for the better
good
Anyone else here because they’re reading “Perfectly You”?
Boa!
I&#39;m here to learn English 😅❤❤️
❤💐🧑‍🚒💐🥀🌺🌹🌴🌏🙏
I had to have crutches when I broke my ankle. I never realized how differently people would treat me. I was the other. People pitied me, made fun of me, although they were funny (sometimes not tho) also made jokes about it<br><br>I also am half Mexican but look completely Mexican so one time when I talked to my grandpa who only speaks Spanish in my broken Spanish, an entire family looked at me like I had committed a sin. It wasn’t even like I said something particularly wrong or anything<br><br>I’m also a very slow runner compared to the other people in my class. People talk bad about me because of this. <br><br>I’m also GT which makes me think different than others.<br><br>However, I will not let these differences define me. I am more than this and i am this. I am powerful. And all of you are too.
What a touching story, i cried when you mentioned your sister, amazing speech
Soo beautiful she is with beautiful heart ❤️
Mariana you are an Amazing young Lady with an extra ordinary future in life. Good Luck on your Journey as a Journalist. As a Public Speaker your grammer,  presentation is precisely perfect. Dios Te Bendiga siempre!  ❤🌹👏👏💃💃☝🙌👐🙏🙏

Why i prefer always listen tedtalk because they are not only beneficial in improving my listening but also provide me a spectacular vision to see things differently.
Israel falsifies the facts. They are criminals who kill the Palestinians without humanity or mercy. Search for the truth about these despicable fools.
good luck❤❤❤❤

My favorite TED talk yet - I&#39;ve shared it with my closest circle.  Thank you!
Except LGBTQ everything has point.
Lovely latinas ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The fear of the unknown, the fear of the known, pick your poison or go with the flow.
Poor girl. She really blames Trump LOL
great speech
amazing
I only came here for my &quot;understanding the self&quot; subject
I think the true challenge is, and byrononly slightly touched on, is the actual cognitive process of “what/why” a child becomes unresponsive and/or ‘refuses’ to do a given thing after one or two basic requests. And separately, how a set, scheduled chore is continuously lost in the child’s mind to organically feel to do within themselves in the first place?  These things could be all connected or separate. Byron saying to stop making the sock an issue, pick it up for your own needs, and thereby you lead by example….THAT is the root of connection and mutual respect that was needed at an earlier stage of something.  Because she is essentially describing what you do when your dog runs off leash, and the more you chase, the dog thinks it’s a game of chase you are joining in on….the #1 thing in dog training is don’t chase and they will wonder where you are and come back. It just means there is a missing link of connection and maybe “better” communication, but I think it may be something else beyond words. It is the act of teaching compassion, values, ethics, body autonomy/ responsibility, sharing,  and the reason why a rule is in place and why it is there at all, and why one thing is important and matters to another human and the good things or consequences by doing a thing or not.
So beautiful ❤❤
Beautiful message and person too, on the inside and out. Inspired me to own what makes me special ❤
Great speech.

I like englis language <br>I learned 1 years ago
She is so beautiful<br>Motivational
Heart touching 😳
Simplesmente é uma pessoa iluminada e abençoada.
Wow that 😊
HER AND HER SOUL IS BEAUTIFUL
Great speech until she blamed Trump for racism and separation in our country.  He had just become president and somehow he was the reason for decades, no centuries, of racism that presidents and leaders before him had not eradicated.
I love it
she&#39;s really very proficient in english
Please work in human RIGHTS I am sure you will tackle these waters in a unique way .
Outstanding 🎉
There are over eight billion people on Earth and our planet is over 4.5 billion years old. You are not special, nothing you do matters in the least and death comes for us all. Let&#39;s go get some ice cream.
Thanks alot dea sister  I,m very happy  to advance me😊❤
Dr Pius is such a wealth of knowledge!! He always strives to provide only??❤
mariana atencio xplained us how to get atention🥳

Nossa, que mulher linda!
bubble bubble toil and trouble the biggest schidzio is the nation state of united states of america people work live and play against the constitution ever minute every hour every da every wekk every month and this effects most other countries especially other angle saxon nations and european countires andin the americas due to the great game and monroe doctrine and might is right doctrine and policies which have destablilized the world
great speech 💕💐
Honestly melted my heart
What an eloquent &amp; articulate speech! <br>Being able to imagine yourself beyond others see in you is the toughest part. <br>Love this line a lot. <br>I’m also a person who does the same thing differently which gives power to me for being creative &amp; willpower is another tool to fight all the struggles come along the path. Success can’t beat anyone, if someone is determined &amp; humble.<br>On 12th November 2025, I will also speak in TEDx and inspire people through my life story.
Yes! Yes and yessss!!
I&#39;m learning English language nowadays but It likes speech to me it&#39;s amazing❤

Wonderful speech. Thank you.

I am a student at the university. From country to city, my voice is different and it makes me feel shy. I become more introverted and do not talk with my friends, in the meeting I just say: I agree with all members and do not raise my ideas. It is terrible. Today, i listen to her and i want to change myself, I am not sure i can change my thinking immediately but i will try my best. Thank you for your speech.I love u
Nice message <br>Nice way of presentation
you only stand out from others when you start thinking differently and start to see things from other people perspectives too, this is what people can&#39;t do cause there is a race and everyone want to win but they just simply do not know that they are not any different they are same and pathetic and creating chaos in the minds of the people who are worthy of change things and make a difference
&#39;Being deferent  also means thinking different &#39;... That&#39;s the speech made my day delightful..
wonderful speech
Me da risa como habla de sufrimiento por que la enviaron a un campamento en Minnesota y como se llama a si misma &quot;fuerte&quot; por soportar el &quot;terrible campamento&quot; sin su Ipad. Me pregunto los niños refugiados latinos, los americanos que vivimos en desigualdad todos los días que pensaríamos de eso?  <br><br>It makes me laugh how she talks about suffering because she was sent to a camp in Minnesota and how she calls herself &quot;strong&quot; for enduring the &quot;terrible camp&quot; without her iPad. I wonder what Latino refugee children, Americans who live in inequality every day, would think of that?
💐💐💐
Great speech. Thank you
Simply Amazing!
I think 90% viewers of Ted talks are South Asians
Don&#39;t let them define you..
😢
❤❤❤
&quot; Lets celebrate those imperfections that make us special &quot;
كتير حبيت طريقة شرحها وافضل شي بالنسبة لي هي مقولة:( انك تقدر تشوف نفسك بطريقة غير طريقة الناس لك هو شيء صعب وحلو ) + حبيت تفهمها للاسلام
✌️
Your speech n beauty inspiring so much. Thanks babe
Why did change the original audio from English into Spanish? I didn&#39;t like this configuration for this video. Greetings from Sonora México 🇲🇽
- We are all different. Our differences make every one of us special. Our differences are our strengths.<br>- Don&#39;t label others based on their differences. We may all be different, but we are all still human.<br>- We can all learn something from one another. Embrace our unique differences.
Here I am, thinking I don&#39;t have anything unique in me
١:يبدا هذا الامر بفهم مايجعلك مختلفا .. من خلال تبني هذه الصفات..حينها فقط تستطيع تقدير مايجعل الاخرين مميزين؛<br>&quot;اسلوبي&quot;<br><br>٢:الأدراك بأنك مختلف يعني أيضا أن تفكر بشكل مختلف وهذا يحتاج لشجاعة لظهور الأحترام<br>_قد تتغير حياتك في جزء من الثانية!
Nothing, absolutely nothing makes special. Which the exact reason I should&#39;ve been left alone from the get go.
Always remind myself: &quot;This is a thought, it&#39;s just a thought. I don&#39;t have to believe it. I don&#39;t have to act on it, I don&#39;t have to fight it. I can let it pass through.&quot;
That speech is very wonderful ❤👍
ءش
i love this
I’m here to learn English
great speech❤from Bangladesh.
牛逼
Come to Pakistan and talk to me.
Differences are not matter, but various people makes too much of sh`1t. That&#39;s a reason to keep these animals on a distance - they are not bad, they just do bad things.
We are all different because we are all different wonderful speech
Right word intended to voided
When our finger prints r different then!!
I think u r special as u r v.beautiful woman!!
Hy any body from ❤ INDIA ❤
Me encanto este video
a good and motivating video🤗👍<br>from myself I want to add, first we need to realize ourselves and then accept, and only after that we will be able to sincerely and truly accept others.<br>after all, the problem of not accepting others lies in the conflict with oneself.<br>external manifestations are reflections of the inner🙏.
❤❤❤
What a brilliant speaker.
One of the best TED talks I&#39;ve ever heard! Incredibly beautiful presence and touching topic. Definitely an idea worth spreading!
Nice speech

powerful speech ❤
are you kidding me... being different as a Muslim and being different as a passionate Latin American dancer get very different treatment and attitudes from people (the mainstream people in a white society, you know what I mean), and their behaviours towards us affect how we feel about ourselves and how hard we need to fight to not internalize those attitudes. You cannot compare the prejudice against Latin Americans to the prejudice against Muslims.
Aprendi mas de ti que de otras chicas, no me gusta comparar pero que ideas dejo entrar
Differences are what actually define an individual, the problem relies on what differences you should focus and in what way.
U̲ r̲ h̲o̲t̲
Very clear speech not look like American speech
TQ ❤

The way I see it,’ The father who encouraged his daughter to see the world and explore different lifestyle is so the starting of a parenting. This is what parents are supposed to teach their kids, to stand up and fight..  Not lay down and pamper but to stand up and fight and be the voice for the voiceless. One of the best talks inTED
The thing that distinguished Fatimah the most was her shyness and her adherence to her religion, principles and honor, and this is the most thing that makes a person of high value and distinction, for information only, you and I described Fatima with shyness, and that was not shyness, but shyness, and this is the nature of women in fact, there is a difference between shyness and modesty.

And if you have a rough time in understanding this, I can&#39;t recomend the book &quot;The courage to be disliked&quot;, it&#39;ll change your life for the better. =)

Mariana thanks to you for teachings us such a great lesson of life.
هل احد هنا مسلم؟
الذي يجعلنا مميزون تمسكنا بالدين الاسلامي
لا بل انتم الذين لا تمثلون شيئا بالنسبه لنا<br>يا ملاعين .<br>حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل فيكم<br>انتم لكم الدنيا تستمتعون بها بما فيها من مال  وشهره ونحن لنا الاخره بها جميع النعم.<br>من اراد ان يعرف الدين الحق يبحث ولا يجد غير كلام المولى (القران الكريم)
الحجاب ستر لنا ونحن نفتخر به <br>الحمد لله علي نعمة الاسلام نحن لا يهمنا قول البشر او ارضاءهم بل اهم شئ ان لباسنا يرضي الله &quot;عزوجل&quot;

What makes me different: I feel disconnected from normal human interests and desires, more interested in the subject of death than life and in  fictional non-humans than real people.
Как же она ловко в одну кучку ставит мальчиков которые хотят одеваться как девочки и девочек одетых в паранджу, людей которые имеют какое-то несчастье поэтому страдать и людей которые не хотят быть нормальными по своей собственной воле. Прекрасный оратор но чью воли исполняет она? Утопая в аплодисментах научитесь читать между строк... Почему американцы думают что жители востока созданы только для того чтобы в лучшем случае обучить их танцу живота🤔
Making sandwich and eating so delicious😋✨

MARIANA 👋🏻👋🏻
Nothing npw shut up
Uma bela reflexão!!❤️
Nothing interesting in this story sorry
In this time , noone is coming to save us ,protect us ,as well as help us .never aspect anything to  anyone believe in yourself .and as we all know , only some thing make us different and respectful . When we  get success , achievement , and so on ....so believe in yourself and make anything possible 🙏🙏🙏🙏
So good speech 💫
Hello Journalist Mariana Atencio🌐🛡️🚭♀️🥰Im always different, the oddball in the room, Hun
I hate journalists, but you ❤️
do not Cry over spilled milk ..
that inspires the me and the world perfect talk
wonderful
😮😮
Speechless story itself!
I really appreciate of this vedio. Cause of her good lessons
Cette série est extraordinaire et mérite d’être diffusée dans les télévisions  et au Sénégal, Mali ,Guinée,côte d’ivoire , Gabon ,Burkina ,Cameroun
Thankyou for this wonderful talk,it tought all of us. Actually we all pick differences in others sometime in life which is wrong.
natural and unique message
Special-ness is subjective.
I am learning English and deep motivated here so I come this channel😂
goos dear
🏋➡🏌➡🛠➡🏆
Extremely beautiful people giving everyone else life advice seems odd
What the duck is so “special” about being from a culture that abuses women? This is,like saying someone is “special” because they’ve been brainwashed by an oppressive cult. No, they are not. The more they are treated with kid gloves, the more likely it is that they will never snap out of their spell.
Can&#39;t find anything special on me, what about you?
Quien ha traducido este video la palabra &quot;especiales&quot; la pronuncia mal, dice &quot;espelliales&quot;. Es la única crítica, gracias.
I enjoyed watching the video. I learned a lot from it. I also have to work hard to grow one step further. I hope everyone here can grow together. I’ll cheer for you.
all of us have own path/ Own story . our personality makes us different....
Very superficial analysis about our tribal tendency and human biases and not correct at times. It represents exactly what&#39;s wrong with young people . Have very string views and opinions about things they dont understand . Very confident, pretty girl, though. I&#39;ll give her that.
It’s made me cry😢
She really got her message through and made us appreciate that our own life experiences if reflected on can teach us something  of great value.
All good but Need subtitles....
The willingness to contribute will definitely desitibgwish from our self from the rest of the world
❤❤❤
We all need a reminder of that esp nowadays
I am happy so amending good
So cute speech ❤
An absolute darling !!
❤ wow nice 💯
Amazing lesson of life: our differences make us wonderfully human.
Mariana, I cried with you ❤ Thank you
I liked this Ted Talk..thank you! Encouraging others  I know to view it
Very impressive ❤️😍
YOU CAN AT LET
Hi ..I am. From.baghdad Iraq...❤❤❤❤❤

Super powerful speech
Buytfl voice darling ❤️🫶🏽💪🏻
great for study dear
How beautiful Lesson of life❤
Does being smart make me special? I hope not!
Your words are nice, but do you think that the politicians will listen to you, darling? Politicians are responsible for what is going on and what has gone on around the world. I do agree with you that humanity is everything. Well donevearling!
You are a great orator, Mariana. You are truely brilliant. Beautifully structured speech, spoken without any written cue.
It’s been 22 years I never visited my native country ,thanks to immigration laws!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Mixing science and ethics. Yes, all people were BORN equal... BORN... Meaning, life makes some of us SO different that you may not and shall not treat them equally. How unequally? Let the experts -- be it doctors or judges -- and the law to decide - not always your ethics.
Listening TEDx TALKs serves as my background music every day...I learned a lot from this.
Crybaby! Always blaming and complaining… NBC roach👌
I don&#39;t relate your culture with ours.... I came here only learn english ..... thanks speaker....
Amazing!!!
Same here I also came here to learn english.
Wow so cute I hope everyone will listen to you for long without being tired and bored...
Nice english 😊😅🎉❤
I am a student from Vietnam. I often use TED as a source of learning, this time I do extensive listening. The speaker makes inspired for learning English from the listener and also for gaining the strength to become independent. They were inspired by the listener&#39;s speech and hope to one day deliver a speech on stage like them.
Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.<br>Margaret Mead
Sometimes we are over  analyzing who and what we are. Sometimes it’s just too much.   JUST BE!     Be the best version of yourself wherever you are and whoever you are. This is Beautyful of life.

Bro, everything was good until see start to tal about immigrants... And no, no all people&#39;s are good what means not all immigrants are good and less is there is no regulations, you can&#39;t just open your country to others, will be a mess without any regulations.<br>I am immigrant on US, and I understand why they try to keep on line, not only Donald trump kick people from US every government did and this is just a way to advertising to get votes or make them lose votes.<br>This is not about who you are, this just a matter of votes and if someone say that they will open borders or something like that is just a lie to get votes, they don&#39;t care about you, it&#39;s just about votes. <br>I didn&#39;t like how she included this about immigrants but other than that was very nice talk.
Respect 👏👏
Thank you 🙏🏽
you don&#39;t have to be perfect to start. But you need to start for perfect
So nice journey and fantastic experience
Beauty is truth, truth is beauty, I&#39;m here to see glamour of speaker❤️from Bangladesh ❤️
Part of parents are core in your personlaity building and also that part affects you throughout the life.
&quot;I want you to celebrate it&quot;<br><br>We do every June lol
💡💯
In simple words i loved it really, you know we are human but in many cases we didn&#39;t pay attention what life&#39;s wants to teach us, we are here to grow up, if you fall is completly okey, just stand up and keep going. &quot;If you are different, you are supose to think differently&quot; it&#39;s not the same phrase that mariana used in the speech but for me means the same, today i realize that we are here to be happy and strongs, we are here to live like today is our last day, cause we understand what we choose.
In my case Q&amp;A
Love you😘💕
This young lady is very articulate, a great speaker; and wiser beyond her evident 25 years that I think I ever seen; and hey I am more then twice her age.  A great quote &quot;being able to imagine yourself beyond how other people see you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=922">15:22</a>&quot;.
illegal immigrant should be banned, no sympathy shown to them, terrorist activities increased due to illegal immigrants

Life contain from different so we have to accept different
you can not replace anyone,because everyone has a specific detail.
Being &quot;normal&quot; is just being different from the ones who do not fit into the rigid definition of normalcy.
as a migrante make me speciall feeling for the speech
The things makes me special, the way how i choose or made a decision in life though life is tough and felt like life knock you down i always think about that  this is not may day you know even you wanted to enjoy that day it didn&#39;t coz sometime everything not a god thing to us but i don&#39;t f......care about that coz i wanted to live the way i want.
&quot; bạn không thể để sự khác biệt đó định nghĩa bạn &quot;
Very good speech
You are so smart girl. Thank you for this.

I don&#39;t understand, However I try everyday listening and speak English
Thank you. I never thought that instead of always struggling to keep myself away from being &quot;normal,&quot; I could just think that nobody is &quot;normal&quot; either.

I think, this vedeo was change my student life
Sometimes we are over  analyzing who and what we are. Sometimes it’s just too much.   JUST BE!     Be the best version of yourself wherever you are and whoever you are.   EVOLVE AS A HUMAN BEING INTO THE GREATEST POTENTIAL  WITHIN AND THEN GIVE OUT.      WE ALL HAVE SEEDS OF GREATNESS.

the more you run after the will of others, the easier you lose yourself, because from the moment you were born into the world, you have been  a separate, unique and priceless individual.
This is one of the best presentations I&#39;ve seen.
Hello Mariana, good afternoon! First of all, Happy New Year 2023 for you. Congratulations for this lecture that you gave at TEDx Talks several years ago. You have a good level speaking English. This video of yours is one of my favorites ones at TEDx Talks. Congratulations for your work in USA. Greetings from Sonora, México 🇲🇽... 👍
I love your work. Beautiful and successful compatriot.

So beautiful, powerful and well spoken. Amazing young lady with a powerful message for all of us.
Thank you. I really needed to hear this. The truth
Great speach
I very love you
Life
such an inspiring talk
Any person is helping me  to learn eng  please i really needed it.
Too bad you ruined your talk by bringing up Trump and Republicans , blaming them and thinking they are the problem.  Guess we should have known better listening to someone from NBC “news”.  Time to wake up lady!  Obama and the Democrats are worse than you think.
yoo shoutout bla
Wow.
2016 was a sad year for all of the others in US
💙💚💛🧡❤💜🤎
Loved it 🥰
I have no idea what makes me special. I spend a lot of time with people who have issues with others being special or standing out🙂
This was gteat till she used politics in her story
uma pergunta e vc conseguil a naturalização Americana?
i&#39;ve been othered all the time - even here
I get the energy and the message is lovely but don’t forget that resources is finite being humanistic have to go both way, a Give to one person is a Take from another, so competition and comparison are natural behavior and should be embraced and practice across all levels and domains so the body of our civilization moves forward and grow. Tldr: Sympathy is important but can’t be blindly, let alone legality, which created to protect someone’s rights just as much as other’s.
This made me cry. Thank you!
it was a great speach, amazing.
Hello with handful of delight first-of-all &amp; having  handful of faith,trust towards word/talk here of respectable-in-real Mariana.Will be delighted with our&#39;s meet too if becomes possible with glory, grace of Lord Almighty present upon all now/today, always/everyday. Handful of OKAY too....

Phenomenal
Muslims are here 👇✨.
It &#39;s amazing to find humans like her That&#39;s what we should be.  Thank u❤
No doubt, your speech was very well. I learnt lots from your humble words. But it is also mentioned in Quran that, “Oh mankind, indeed we have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another.”<br>I request you to read Qur&#39;an with English translation.
Nothing makes me special and that&#39;s just how I like it.
Mujy to zeyada tar words like smj hi Nhi i 😪
ليش فين الترجمه العربيه
I liked this talk and the overall message is good, but one reflection was very clearly missing from me by Mariana. And that is internalised Islamaphobia and misogyny. This idea that Mariana brings up, that Fatima would get &quot;in the way&quot; of having a boyfriend, a dress code etc., screams of an internalised issue and double-standards with what we are seeing now in 2022 (and always have been) in the media. That a woman or girl, despite landing in the same educational institution and room-share as Mariana, is still &quot;lesser&quot; than because she doesn&#39;t conform to a Westernised dress code (hijab) or way of life (boyfriends, dating etc). That, the only acceptable woman out there is the Western white woman. This is an example of what I believe Rachel Cargle means by &#39;White Feminism&#39;, and this point was truly missing in this talk.
Bravo!  Thank You. You are brave and you are right on.
I really appreciate it 🤗 I wish the best in your life
so beautiful, so powerful
Awesome speaker 😊
It&#39;s amazing how this hurts me and heals me at the same time!
Muito bom fazia tempo que não chorava
We are different ✌️
Working upon ourselves is important because until we work upon ourselves,we can&#39;t be happy
Today this speech become a big lesson for me
Let&#39;s celebrate those imperfections that make us special

My greetings 🙏 ♥️ from Sudan. Thank you very for your nice channel
Nice
She is good speaker
Bravo Mariana thank you for that unique speech..
Thank you so much
It&#39;s very important to learn English that you will will have to follow three rules  which are listening , reading and writing.
Good speech and message but at some parts looked like a little overreacted. Also IMO when we latins speak english we have to be ourselves and not overstate or force pronunciations to look like Americans, here except when she says &quot;Venezuela&quot; : -)
Hope All Americans must to help each others to find the ways.American Dreams come true to all &amp; Fairness for all Americans.Good Wishes for Native Americans &amp; Immigrants Americans who came from across the globe 🌏<br>Thanks your story.
I experienced that &#39;bad school experience&#39; it dehumanised me for the rest of my life.
Shakita?
Amazing !!! Thank you
Superb.😇🙂😎🐘🐩🐓🐈💚
Hold on❤️
Amazing story and great speech! Yes! We are all UNIQUE. I have lived in another country too, learned languages and I met beautiful people around the world. We were all so empathetic towards each other and we learned a lot. The best thing is that I previously studied anthropology and there I accepted it as an internship. I am grateful for that!
People are of two types, either your brother in religion or your equal in character
“We’re all different, no one has a claim on the word normal, we’re all wonderfully quarky and unique , that’s what makes us wonderfully human”<br><br>This is my key take away...
good and meaningful

المسكينة فاطمه حزنت عليها ماعاشت مراهقتها كما ينبغي دس لايك لذي المغرورة الي كسرت خاطر بنت البحرين
I only come here to learning English language
Her words will soothe anyone gate-crashing a first-world country.

Differences really make you stronger
Very interesting and inspiring 👏Yes,we are all Human beings ❤and we are different in a lot of way,our culture. We are all Special!!
Best video on the internet today Kudos and more power to you Girl ❤️🥰 Love from India
Beautiful girl beautiful speech
I learned a lesson.
you want us to defend ourhuman race but in tthe begininig of your speech you asking us about why we are against LGBT
Perfect
You are unique and special in your own way.
I&#39;m crying thank you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=492">8:12</a>
we should respect the differents of other people. Don&#39;t label some one because we are not same them. Everybody is a person and difference with others.
&quot;You can&#39;t let those differences define you. Being able to reimagine yourself beyond what other people see, that is the toughest task at all but it&#39;s also the most beautiful.&quot; ❤
it encourages me!
Thank you so much, i got a great deal of useful information on life
esta periodista esta mal informada, en un sólo período Obama deportó más gente (latinos) que Trump en su período. Ahora Biden ha deportado más gente que Trump....
Definitely every word is essential for me.
So powerful.
Thank you so much for beautiful words,  any body here just looking for changing life videos, then your one of successful people
Beautifully explained that .... Before anything we all are human ❤️
Preciosa lección de vida &lt;3
You never know what the future holds 😉.
Dang. And I only clicked cause I saw a cute girl.
We are all diffrient .
간지난다
This was so beautiful said. We are so obsessed to fit in that we forget that being different is what we should celebrate.
PEACE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=935">15:35</a> learn and reprogram yourself.

where is she from?
This is so beautiful and i totally agree. i know that i am different yet i didn&#39;t assume that for fear of rejection. Sometimes i keep myself silent because what have to say is so different of their  (family members, friends) point of view and i guess and do not want to hurt anyone.

Nguyen Kim Good music
Saturday 16 July 2022 I will remember good experience
You can&#39;t level others &quot;Difference&quot;
Llegué aquí mientras leía su libro “perfectamente tú” quiero aprender y aquí estoy!
One of the best Ted Talks.
The Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: Every person has what he intended
The Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: Be optimistic about the good, and you will find it
!!
I know what makes her special &lt;3
“Nobody has a claim on the word Normal”.
appricate you..
Your experience,wise decisionsof ur parents and ur good heart was so much visible in ur speech. Everyone  is busy looking for his own special traits as but what an incredible  thought that underlined the whole session  that we have to look for those special  qualities  in other persons also. If everyone  does that then half of the conflicts will be resolved without any efforts. It was such a motivational speech.
Being imperfect makes me special
I need you to ask your   Friend for your family love your help and help me help you with your intentions so please ask in place of nnedding to force your help as for your audience interest please send me your address and I will help your need be met by using your interest in a community Way please note your abilities might be useful and note worth I hope you feel better Christalin aka Chrissy
This is random but Mariana, did you go to summer camp via EVI?
Thank you very much for telling me something important.
Amazing
What a captivating speech, a real Eye-opener.
Beautiful lady-Amazing Lesson and her pronunciation is pretty good
She made me more confident than before <br>and she told us being different is beautiful
The American way of life is egocentric pathetic and not as fun as those other countries
Sempre levo comigo palavras que realmentem me fazem me sentir melhor, ou até mesmo me inspirem; Como os três palestrantes Eduardo Briceno e Maxi Knust que me inspiraram a mudar meu mindset, e a Mariana Atencio que mudou a minha percepção de como eu via e julgava os outros por serem diferente. Uma vez me disseram &quot;nunca se compare com os outros apenas se compare com a pessoa que você foi ontem&quot;.
I came to the US at 32 years old I have a thick accent still I&#39;m living here and work as a interpreter, I wish I would have stuyinh English earlier
The same politic speach. The totalitary thought
The venomous push concomitantly coach because moon exceptionally frame around a hideous high secure. hilarious, paltry sundial
What makes me different is my birthmark on my face, I used to get bullied because of it but I have this friend, I met him online and he said that its normal and that&#39;s what makes me unique and special, that I shouldn&#39;t care about what people will say about me. I don&#39;t even like to have it too but all the thing that I can do is to embrace it.This video helps me to accept what I am.
Thank you.
Is really excited find this type channel youtube, is so funny.
I&#39;m from Europe and I look more like her compared to the white Americans she&#39;s talking about 😂
&quot;The single thing every one of us has in common is being human &quot; l learned many things thank you .
God loves you and cares for you until this message reaches you that God exists and that life is a test for every human being, and either he will succeed in it and enter the eternal paradise, or he will fail in it and burn in it.  Fire of the world first, then permanent fire after death.  Decide what to do first and last, the world is very short compared to the days of God, so do not lose it and you are not right The biggest loss for a person is to die without knowing God and His Messenger Muhammad.  This is right or not, God loves you and takes care of you
.
Well explained
I watched this show. 😂
Wow life is so different from one person to another put what I am sher about that everyone have his amazing story that he will didn&#39;t forget it ever
We  have to  live  together with  tolerence and respect.I&#39;m learn english.I&#39;m from Brazil.
Mariana Atencio is a wonderfull woman
Fun fact: President Trump deported about 1/3 less illegal immigrants than Obama. Jeese, you press people and your lying liberal bias! That little girl was scared for her mother because of people like you......
A wonderful lecture and it gives a motivator to the human being
I encourage you to read &quot;Handicapped&quot; by Bourne.  Eye opening essay about differences and how friends who overlook our inability to be model or better yet, embrace all of you, makes life special and worth living through the tough times to find the good times!
let&#39;s celebrate those imperfections that makes us special <br>Thank you to give a greatest feeling me
Don‘t put on Stickers on different people )) I agree with this opinion
تلخيص كلامك في قوله تعالى &quot;وجعلناكم شعوباً وقبائل لتعارفوا إن أكرمكم عند الله أتقاكم&quot;
قال الله تعالى مخاطباً النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم &quot;وما أرسلناك إلا رحمة للعالمين&quot;صدق الله العظيم
Summary: I&#39;m a scholar because I imitate Shakira and all Venezuelans are special and should be granted US citizenship immediately.
t u s m
This is alll ridiculous talk because humans are abandoned from nature. If ppl can only step back and see this is all programing games. Planet is our land, we are all just passing here, as others species. This is duality trap but we are all one and same, we shouldn&#39;t not even bothering with this. Better to looking for some free energy and self support so we can live free and without fears and depending on this body and mind and time that has been given to us now.
Maravilhosaaa!!!
this made me cry.....literally :&#39;)
thank you
I seriously want that jacket.    LOL.    Great speech though , no doubt
Is it that easy to come, attend school, work or even live in another country like the US? If so I would like to do that too..

So u&#39;re here doing this speech only to tell us how much special u are??
Yine faydalı bir video oldu, teşekkürler Hikmet Anıl Öztekin.
What if you have disability. How to deal with others looking at you, like you are an alien ? How to deal that you lose chances in career , dreams and other things just because of that ?
But Americans only associate with like-minded.
Hermoso Discurso muy inspirador y hermosas palabras, veo este canal para aprender inglés y me encanta haber encontrado este video de una Venezolana que a triunfando y que trasmite un hermoso mensaje. 💞
Shakira is actually from Barranquilla, Colombia :)
Wait , why fatima is wearing hijab in her room ?
رائع

as a disabled person and someone who had agophobia for years I can relate with her sister&#39;s  story in the challenge we face not because of our disabilities  but because people reject us for being different

Definitely one day I will share my success story on TEDX platform
She is gorgeous 🙃
Few days I&#39;m lestening  this show but I&#39;m not understand her talking style
Wow exceptional talk <br><br>Same goes in my case when I landed from Mumbai to London. 12 years ago. <br><br>Ppl asked me about cows on the road , elephants on the road,. Snake charmers etc.<br><br>Was your school under the tree?  <br><br><br>But now I am proud to see ppl from India started becoming CEO of Google, MSFT, Twitter, Master Card, Adobe to name a few.
She&#39;s not different.  She&#39;s just like every other journalist demonizing half of the population.
❤️❤️
When she said Boyfriend for prom that it  was really a big deal.
It&#39;s honestly so amazing thank you 💗

&quot;Reimagine yourself beyond what other people see&quot;. Amazing, I&#39;m in tears. This was magic. LOVED IT.
Good location for English and lessons learning
man I need closure on fatima
That was really beautiful, Mariana. <br>I wanted to let you know that I live in Bahrain 🇧🇭 where your roommate Fatima is from. And, interestingly, Shakira was in Bahrain and studied in Bahrain International School, which is in my neighbourhood.
The first night 👄👄👄🥭🥭👄👄👄the camp director gathered every one around the camp fire
I could not look up any information
Congratulations
I am proud to be me,  being different is all about respecting yourself not be another!  No matter you live in america or the moon.  We don’t forget where we come from as MUSLIMS .  Our tradition our culture is our values. But for you as a latina.  A boyfriend is your values.  That’s the difference between you and fatima for sure.
Yaa alla go boin oto spite mato ami kunta ow bucci na 😃aktu aste aste mata jay nai, ar somoy na takle akbar somoy kori aiya bokrobbo dio
Amazing!
I&#39;m Mexican with 41 years old of age currently living in California who migrated at 13 years old. I happen to travel to the border for errands and often see the two sides of the coin with complexiblities and limitations in both countries, perhaps all Latin American, Haiti, Ukraine (recently) as well since there&#39;s many immigrants at border daily waiting for a resolution.  I&#39;m U.S. Permanent Resident with family whose U.S. Citizens.. However every time I crossed the border I feel as thought I&#39;m the same immigrant at 13 years old..  Labels do keep people in shadows or it could bring an opportunity to be mindful of others situations.  Thanks for opening a platform for racial-social issues we all share in common! &lt;3
Minha capacidade de entender que as pessoas são RETARDADAS
Xin cánh tay của những người Việt Nam ✋
Hola mi gente! Gracias Mariana &lt;3
Fantastic speech by a young journalist
Oh wow that&#39;s amazing 🤩<br>You are the best 💓😘<br>Only I see your video to learn English 🌚 🫂 <br>You help me so much <br>Appreciate 🎀🖇️

Handful of likes with delight, prayers with trust too for respectable-in-real Mariana learning from 16.36 to 17.37 here..Wishing God bless &amp; praying for needed,desirable AMEN likewise to same now/today,always/everyday..OKAY too..
I&#39;m here because realloreal1 is talking about this video
Мен журналистпін, менің жұмысым - бүгін бүкіл әлемдегі адамдармен қарым-қатынас жасау, мен мұны өз өміріммен не үшін таңдағанымды және не білгенімді айтқым келеді. Менің әңгімем Каракаста, Венесуэлада, мен өскен Оңтүстік Америкада, мен үшін әрдайым сиқыр мен ғажайыптарға толы жерде басталады. Кішкентай кезімнен бастап ата-анам менің әлемге кең көзқарасымды қалағанын қалады. Бір күні есімде, жеті жасымда әкем маған келіп: &quot;Мариана, мен сені және сол кезде алты жасар қарындасыңды ешкім испанша сөйлемейтін жерге жіберемін&quot;,-деді. Сізге әртүрлі мәдениеттермен танысқаныңызды қалаймын. Ол бүкіл жазды Америка Құрама Штаттарындағы осы жазғы лагерьде өткізудің артықшылықтары туралы айтып, сол кезде мен &quot;болашақта сені не күтіп тұрғанын ешқашан білмейтінмін&quot;деген кішкентай сөйлемді баса айтты. Осы уақытта менің жеті жасар ойымда мен Майамидегі жазғы лагерьге барамыз деп ойладым. Мүмкін бәрі одан да жақсы болар еді, және Біз солтүстікке, Мики Маус тұрған Орландоға қарай бет алдық. Мен өте қозғалған. Алайда менің әкемнің жоспары басқаша болды. Каракастан ол бізді Миннесота штатының Брейнерд қаласына жіберді.
With the advent of meditation and dicpline we can learn everything in the world.
Erci Siret 💙
I also came  here for learn English 😁😘😘😘😘
Nothing I can think of.
Currently struggling but One day I will be there sharing mine  story

そうですよね。皆違う一人の人間なのですよね。違って当たり前、同じに括ろうとするのが間違っている。<br>でも、自分を理解し、他人を理解する事はとても難しいです。<br>常に相手の立場になって考えられる人間になりたいと思います。<br>よく他者の考えを変える事は間違っている、考えの違いを理解するべきと。<br>ただ、今現在ウクライナで起きている事を思うと、他者の考えを理解するのは本当に難しい事だと感じます。<br>さて、そんな私は何が出来るのか。
I came here to improve my english. Hope this is a good speech.
Thanks
Her sister is a WARRIOR ❤️
That  woman  has a  heart  more  beautiful  than  her face  and  anyone  with  two  eyes  can  see  that  but  those  people  with a  heart  know  it .
though theres no meaning of her speech, shes pretty
even when im playing video games online i imitate an american accent so i dont feel different or asked multiple questions
Actually, I come here because I&#39;m curious about the topic then she doesn&#39;t make me disappointed. I learnt a very meaningful lesson of life from her. &quot;You can&#39;t let those differences define you&quot;. Appreciate it!
شكر
Simplesmente fantástica, que lição de vida e, sobretudo, é uma ser humana linda, inteligente e poeta da vida. Parabéns Mariana Atencio!!!
C hướng dẫn e và mn bài Một năm mới bình an- Sơn Tùng M-TP đi ạ. Mong c ra vid để e còn tập kịp ạ😅 !!!!
Life lesson!<br>We all are different and actually same
Mainly I&#39;m looking for a short video where I can practice my skills. However, after that, I was struck by this very topic. I am also quite self-deprecating and sometimes try to blend in with the crowd and make myself a different person so as not to be isolated. However, after listening to your presentation I feel more confident about myself. Each person is an independent individual. The difference also creates a highlight for yourself 🥰🥰
Nice speech
When I feel hopeless, I come here and learn other people&#39;s methods of life, and then I find my strength and keep moving.
&lt;3
Elequence👏
Aplausos de pie! Grata sorpresa saberte Venezolana pero eso no es lo q te hace diferente, lo q te hace diferente es tu corazón ♥️
Wonderful presentation, I realize I don&#39;t same the others, I only know what makes me special &lt;3
My imperfection is my MOTIVATION
el profe memo rifa !!! wuuuuuu

It could be dangerous if we bear the courage to show respect for potential robber or terrorists who believe only they and their religion is true, others are wrong and fake. How can we build a good world for all? Should we respect and let them spread or take broader range correctional measures?
Awesome
💓💓💓
I felt most sad for the Muslim roommate that was immediately set aside.  I wondered if Mariana ever reached out to the girl after she appeared to briefly remember her after her talent show accolades?r?  The idea of &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; has certainly not been eradicated.  I certainly don&#39;t see tolerance for different opinions from either side of the aisle.  Youtube itself is notorious for permanently banning content providers that don&#39;t jibe with whatever is the political belief of the moment.  A conservative viewpoint might be what makes you special.
Awesome
Cosmos=quantum adjustment! Life=molecular adjustment! Consciousness=memetic adjustment!
Appreciate your gentle stream  of words @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=1075">17:55</a> Let&#39;s us be humanists before and after everything else 👍
Excellent speech, you are so gorgeous and intelligent. I am not spoken English person, that makes me somehow difficult to understand your speech all but I have learnt alot from this video. Thank so much for this lesson.
I so like her style. In speaking and telling about history and full by motivation. Hopefully, we follow her success 👍🤲
I love  her performance, it gave me a sympathy of what I have been thinking of 🌹
&quot;I hope that it teaches you that nobody has a claim on word NORMAL &quot; ,  <br>Wow ,what a beautiful speech filled with a great message, that our race is Human . 👏 👏 👏
On my paper, &quot; nothing&quot;.
Ok mariana very good in god miss
Ok
Ok aektris papa karona krishna khmer ankhor .
Gracias me sirvio mucho tu video, aveces me siento que no encajo con los demas Psicologos o profesionalistas ya que hacen comentarios como este, Me dicen ranchero y que no me expreso bien. Ya avandone por no quererme desenvolver como soy. Me sale lo de rancho.
👍
Permission to share please
im literally cryin&#39; rn
Does someone know where I can get her shirt?
Wow her hairline is soooo high.
Every American they are not Americans, but are Americans. America for people talent and pacífic and democratic people, America = freedom.

SORRY IS A KEY OF FREEDOM..
mistake is a lesson...
careing is shareing..

Love yrslf before you love somebody.. god blessing you always..
I&#39;m ADHD and I AM different! Also, to say and think that the issue with Obama was because of his race is a farce considering everyone on the opposing party was ready to place their vote for Ben Carson. Get a clue, lady. I accept everyone even if they don&#39;t accept me, and...did she ever find and apologize to Fatima?
yo no entender, no inglish :(
in two years I will be in an auditorium sharing my story for TEDx Talks.
great speech...
LOVE LOVE LOOOVE THIS! SO GOOD!
That&#39;s amazing
These days, common sense would make you quite special.<br><br>Okay, it&#39;s really quite simple. The third dose increases immunity, so after the fourth dose you&#39;ll be protected. Once 80% of the population has received the fifth dose, the restrictions can be relaxed as the sixth dose stops the virus from spreading. I am confident that the seventh dose will solve our problems and we&#39;ll have no reason to fear the eighth dose. The clinical phase of the ninth dose will confirm that the antibodies remain stable after the tenth dose. The eleventh dose will insure that no new mutations will develop, so there is no longer any reason to criticize the twelfth dose.
Someone will want to connect all the underground resources of the country to yourself so that a Venezuelan girl can travel the world like you and you will applaud this.. Journalism!?? you&#39;re kidding
funny. They will exploit all the riches of your country and you will bless it
U r really so kind n motivational speaker to others! 🥰
I used this as my declamation speech. It won.
I think being good is only rule....rest all seems doomsday????
You are really pretty genius <br>i like how you speak with a stonge accent <br>We are different but still humain <br>i&#39;m here to learn english and i learned best lesson ❤
I learned &quot;it is most important to embrace the things that make u different (special) &quot;.❤🌼
Fully shining living,working  within life talked-about in words as well with grace,honesty..Handful of best wishes with delight for living,working of all-of-U to remain as shining always &amp; handful of prayers with trust to keep same blessed,delightful too for all-of-U now/today,always/everyday..Handful of OKAY with delight too....
I didn’t expect her to talk about a girl from Bahrain, my tiny country who no body knows anything about lol
My crush is also charming as her and with  higher thoughts . Which let her reject me.
I need to study in place but I don&#39;t know how to start.
Looks like most of the comments on this video is that they &quot;learned  we are all human&quot;????<br><br><br><br>So much for public education. I would have thought that went without saying.<br><br>What we should know is that the only privilege anyone in the US has is the privilege of being born or migrating legally to the US. You don&#39;t get to come here just because your country is a sheethole. And the far left wacko libs need to expand their voter base because their ideology and policies fail.<br><br><br><br>Btw, isn&#39;t the Huffington Post bankrupt now?<br><br><br>New York CNN Business —  <br>HuffPost officially merged with BuzzFeed on February 16. Less than a month later, the site’s staff is being dramatically cut.<br><br>BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti announced Tuesday that 47 of the 190 HuffPost employees in the US would be laid off and that HuffPost Canada would be shut down, affecting 23 employees. HuffPost union said the cuts in the US affected 33 of its members, representing 30% of its unit.<br><br>Peretti told staffers that the cuts were made to manage costs, adding that HuffPost’s losses exceeded $20 million last year and would be estimated to be similar this year.
Dont get me wrong but if everybody  special,then nobody special.
..
Nothing...I am zero👍
nobody is special, we are equal in the eyes of God the heavenly father of the bible. so repent and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and saviour and receive salvation ❤️
Thank you
Thank you ❤️ I love this! (*ﾟ∀ﾟ*)
I can speak English , and very seriusly study English know
True!!  - To be a unique person means that you are one of a kind and no other person is exactly like you. This uniqueness partly comes from within, shown through our actions and behaviors. According to the Oxford Dictionary, the meaning of unique is “being the only one of its kind; unlike anything else.
I here
I admire your courage,and i really learnt about life lessons.god bless you.😘😘🌍
💙💙💙
Wow what a sound of voice
I need help not your stories
She&#39;s right!!!
WOWWW
I&#39;m Fatema from bangladesh🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩(Faridpur)
The excellent speaking of Mariana Atencio is need to curiosity of learning with encouraging to experimental learning to promote competency based learning which is need through this information it is lovely for all
What made me surprised is her Dad asked her to leave home country, my Dad has never done that, he only kept asking me to go back to my home country, and stay close to him.

Thank you so much 😭😭😭😭
A wonderful woman!
Thanks 😊
Amazing ❤️❤️
Wonderful
No one has a claim on the word &quot;normal&quot;.....FACTS!!!!!!  Great discussion Mariana, thank you for sharing your story!
thats wonderful from maiana to share her experience
I learn English because I want to go anywhere in the 🌎
She has pretty eyes. So I clicked. Smart girl, very well traveled. She speaks about her father molding her, which can be shown in her confidence. What about her mothers presents in her life. Was curious of that. Well done. I loved saved by the bell too growing up lol. I laughed at the locker, picture-perfect life and I was too quickly disappointed. At least she went to an eastern state school; where the schools are aesthetically pleasing. Good Work mate. Cheerio.
O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).<br>(Q&#39;uran. Surah Al-Hujurat Verse 13)<br><br>Wealth and children are [but] adornment of the worldly life. But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for [one’s] hope.<br>(Al Kahf Verse 46)
Why am I in tears just watching this
Boanoite amor abraço
انتي مميزه من غير
Holding other peoples&#39; differences against them is a defensive shield because we know we are living in the luxury that SHOULD be shared, equally, with them (but has been stolen for only our own benefit). The luxury of broken leg is song and dance to those whose entire life opportunities are blatantly stolen in racism and exclusion barely because of fear they might come to know of our thievery, and might dominate over us. No thought they might not have any mind for revenge but rather celebration and brotherhood. Yes, your message is on the beautiful world we have lost in the myopia of greed that denies us the peace of knowing that the sum total of all our differences is humanity itself. We have lost a whole lot more by only holding our own narrow viewpoints. Power to you, sister. Wonder how much you could show us WHEN you experience even wider parts of this wonderful Pale Blue Dot?
From a neighbor next door to Venezuela and his people, I can totally agree and applaud Mariana. We can all make a contribution to humanity when we are treated humanely. I came to this country of ours as a poor teenager with great dreams of becoming an engineer and being successful. Well, my dream was realized, not because those who looked down on me but those who opened their doors and hearts and held my hand through my life in this beautiful country of us all. God bless America
i dnt knw. im just na ordinary girl.
GOAT talk👌👌✨✨
They were not laughing at you to make any correlation. That&#39;s called bullying. Good for you for not letting those bullies affect you in a negative way.
Нечего не понял:)
Neu em muon chung ta de lay nhau trong nam nay

I don’t think you’re the other. I believe you are what you think you are. So, if I were to ask you, what would you tell me!?  <br>Vivir tu vida! 🇻🇪 🇺🇸 🇪🇨✊💯❤️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
So true, this is exactly what that was when I was communicating with Americans. I am Taiwanese, and  a six grader. Perhaps they don’t feel that I was cool enough to be in the same space as them. It was surreal.
&quot;the single thing every one of us has in common is being human&quot;what a beautiful lessons u taught me today!! Thank you 💖
شصار على فاطمه :(
That&#39;s amazing ♥️
What I wrote in my paper is I&#39;m different and I&#39;m happy -K
We are all human
&lt;3
she is very very excellent‼︎
Came here to improve my english but most importantly i learned lesson for life. God bless you sis.
Wow I really enjoyed watching this thank you Mariana Atencio your a very wise young Lady... :)
Love the essence of your message. But that part about Donald Trump is an overly one-sided assessment of his policy.
this video was a sad story but a successful story what can change our life<br>and there was many meaningful lines i learn so many thing from this video and i really loved it
Quite a leading and misleading title: What Makes You Special?
Привет всем она может хорошим оратором специалист по рекламе в приложении
this speech was so profound and she is so eloquent. amazing i’m so proud of her and the audience for celebrating their differences.
Priceless! Celebrating humanity in our individual differences!
Lesson learned.... We are all different.<br>Accept it... Celebrate it
Human...🙂
Iron lady
I just came here seeing his beauty
Racism is being kept alive by the media. We all came from the same small group of humans.
Definitely I appreciate that type of person who grow up... And faced it many difficulties in thier life... Really when I listened her my goosebumps came...👏👏
&quot;You can&#39;t let differences define you GAL! &quot; - This is the most meaningful line for me. I&#39;m just in tears right now......
I wanna speak English well
Ppl hi I&#39;m different here iam from the third world 🌍 (middle east) actually I&#39;m Palestinian man the Israel people has been taken my country so my name really refugees thanks
✍🏽
One day i will be in this place to told people my success story
She&#39;s so beautiful
every one is unique, we have to accept it and do something differently
a lot of love from Pakistan, amazing the way she explained things.
We are all different
I m also watching this for learning English as well as good lesson
Amazing day
I&#39;m feeling hurt that I cannot ignore the fact I&#39;m hardly sure what makes me special nor different, but surely have been feeling unsafe by it. <br>Probably the fact I cannot properly value what I have makes myself less special but me feel a human shaped obstacle. I wonder if such a day would come, to be able to proud myself.
Uh, why is it ok-even demanded-that u can just  walk into my country to get stuff, but I cant do the same to your&#39;s?
Learn Turkish in my channel
When i open the video my mind innerly talk to the english but sad is i did&#39;t speak lively it&#39;s come to so much fear but one day not one day today also start to the talking to in front of mirror but these video helping some more confidence. Thank you
This woman is amazing . She should work along side Amal Clooney 🤩 just amazing
شكرا من القلب ماريانا❤
Her voice is so strong I love it
I SAW A COUPLE OF PICTURES<br>* Someone not so friendly<br>* U are narcisisst... nothing wrong with it<br>* What makes u different?? Details<br>* Human race is always the same<br>* And also a bit/or more than a bit.. of pure egoism<br>* I went out with some girls from Venezuela and so on... friendly, passionate and a little bit bigoted culture (it means a moral striktly conform to religion)<br>* The most beautifull thing i saw is that u care about kids who has &quot;broken life&quot; as u think of urself<br>* But what i dont, and will never understand is:<br>- U feel like a minority<br>- Give respect= it is called education<br>- U want that someone gives in practice rights to a minority when u say in practice that everything (the majority) doesnt work.. at all= irresponsable, even if with a position<br>- U do it when things works; it is like to say that u have a team with no defence and u want them to score with a left hand and not a right one= certain defeat
This is something that made my day ❤️
Thank you so much
🍄🤡🍄
Literally my favorite TED talk so far
wow, it&#39;s like different history in your life.  we should learn also from our life to grow up every single day. thank you.
Best speech so far. 💞She has got a strong and powerful voice which can embrace each and everyone 🔥
Good intention but messy and bad presentation.
wow
Listening again  ...     ...
Ironically the other in society today is the different between who has an mrna treatment and who doesn&#39;t human nature is the one thing that will never evolve.
Thank you for the inspiration 🙏🏼
Es una muy mala entrevista primero aprende a hablar español y luego Dize  que es de Venezuela y se ve muy sana que no en Venezuela no ay comida
Wow!!❤
Listening
What stupidity, by God! It is incredible how they manipulate weak-brained people with beautiful words and emotional stories, so that they cry and do something predetermined, such as voting in the presidential elections! But the saddest thing is that they manipulate the society of the United States!!!, they treat them like animals in a social experiment! That is why Biden won, and that is why that country is weaker and more impotent every day! <br>there are invading people who think they own the country where they are given refuge!! Venezuelans do that in Colombia and also in the United States! Instead of giving thanks, they go there to get rich and destroy the country that shook their hands !<br><br>Qué estupidez, por Dios!!!, es increible como manipulan a la gente debil de cerebro con palabras bonitas y cuentos emotivos , para que lloren y hagan algo predeterminado como por ejemplo votar en las elecciones presidenciales!, pero lo más triste, es que manipulan a la sociedad de EStados Unidos !!!, los tratan como animales en un experimento social!, por eso ganó Biden, y por eso ese país es cada día más debil e impotente!, hay gente invasora que se cree dueños del país a donde les dan refugio!!, eso lo hacen los venezolanos en Colombia y tambien en Estados Unidos!, en cambio de agradecer, van allí a hacerse ricos y a destruir el país que les dio la mano!
👋

الحمد لله رب العالمين واللهم صل وسلم وبارك على سيدنا محمد وعلى اله وصحبه أجمعين ولاحول ولاقوة إلا بالله العلي العظيم .
If the subtitles were given,it would have been more easy to understand
I came here for learning English?is here anybody to learn English
Great speech.
تدخل جميل وامرأة رائعة الجمال
Tbh after listening to the whole video i still don&#39;t know how to answer this question<br>&quot;what makes u special?&quot; I still don&#39;t understand what it actually means lol
Let celebrate the imperfections---
What a wow speech!! God bless u
Tuyệt vời
Wow it was really amazing.Yeah we should celebrate our imperfections and differences and embrace it cz it&#39;s what makes us so beautiful.I understood her speech without subtitles, though I had to struggle in some parts. And I am happy cz I think I have improved a bit.
HUMANS 😊 we are different from each other and that&#39;s okay, we should all try to be more kinder and everything works out not perfectly but eventually
&quot;You can&#39;t let differences define you&quot; - this is the most meaningful line for me. I&#39;m just in tears right now, only came here to learn English then I also learned a beautiful lesson of life🙂We cannot label others &quot;different&quot; because we are all different. Great speech.I&#39;ve always been wondering what it means to truly embrace diversity. I think her speech gave me some really important hints. Thanks so much!
My English isn&#39;t very good, and how happy I am to know what the contents of this video are. this is so beautiful thank you so much
I loved it .Because I learned life experience .🙃🥰
I click this video because her face on thumbnail steal my eyes. She is beautiful.
I was learning English recently, I almost spent all my part time on youtube,today,i&#39;m so happy that i could understand 95% content of this video.just some single word i can&#39;t get and then i learn some new words from this show,thanks a lot, I appreciate it!

This speech is one of the best I have seen so far. I couldn’t identify with her experience more as a female aircraft mechanic from Panama that came here at 21 years old.
I have nothing that makes me special what do i do? 😭
What an impactful talk!
Hai sir jayron! Sana proud kana saken nanood ako

Don’t mention anything political if you don’t know what you’re talking about. Stop assimilating by repeating information that your audience wants to hear (regarding politics).

Я в шоке! Столько нового для себя познал, просмотрев ее выступление🤗 BRAVO!!!👏
Native Americans are in all the countries of the American continent. It is the Governments that are the aliens. But that&#39;s just my perspective.
I didn&#39;t like it, you think you are something like a victim but this is not true, you had a lot of opportunities, most people don&#39;t have the chance to let their countries like you did even have the opportunity to study, you lived a great life because of your parents, they did great work! that was an experience that made you grow up and learn, you are not special because of your nationality... you are special because of your livings and experience and how you generate value to the society. Why didn&#39;t you talk about how those situations made you grow and what you learned from them?
she tight
If you ask her about real us history Yous see she doesn&#39;t know any fucken U. S. History. ! Go to Fucken China or any where else .

i&#39;m a brown skin woman who&#39;s donated my time and money all my life to charity. yet i was horrified to find that none of the fund raising vidios, or how to  vidios  ever  feture brown people as  knowledable people in their documentaries. I recently experienced that with the ACT Santa Barbarbara county vidio  I had to watch inorder to perticipate  in  helping  homeless people. The whole vidio on how  to  act  was  all  white people 40 minuts in. Then  I stoped watching, Brown folks  have  a  lot   to offer so  Why  do  they  keep  them  out?  If  you  don&#39;t  beleive  me  watch  all  thease training  vidios  for  thease  charities.<br>Brown  skinned poeples knowledge matters!!!! <br><br><br><br><br><br>act
Sugar buns
What a heartfelt message &lt;3!!!  Iloveit
hello admin, may i repost your video on my youtube account in the language of my country, i am very interested in all of your videos and i hope to benefit more people, thank you 👍
I want also to speak public but I have no enough confident.
Why don&#39;t you help fix Venezuela?
Simply she trying to say be different. ..
How I wish I can talk with the confidence like that
❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is she speaking British accent or American
Still a lot of Americans 🇺🇸 are very closed mined and the hate is still alive
I am Pakistani  l agree with you
It&#39;s so boring to see people looking the same way, dressing the same way. Thinking the same way. Being different Is interesting and wealthness. Knowing from different cultures Is brain expanding.
Ela fala inglês muito bem.
What a amazing speech! I am here to learn English, i&#39;ll use english to explore different cultures in the word, this is the first comment i write in youtube, i want to leave a mark to mark my progress.
The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine. Successful people do daily what the unsuccessful only do occasionally
Wauw!! This speech is so beautiful and eye opening ❤️
I&#39;m just here to learn English but I&#39;m so lucky because I learnt a lot from this channel not just to learn English but to improve my whole life❤️
Hermosa mujer
wysiwyg !
Thank you TEDx
Beautiful looking..
i read her book and have now fallen in love with her personality
I totally agree with you. At 23 I lost my right arm and eyes, later I got divorced I lost my marriage, my parents died and I dared not to do things that will harm others and I dedicate myself to help others and it is very beautiful what you said, my family is very beautiful and my children too, even if they don&#39;t live with me in the country. I can tell you that when I had my two arms and eyes I was an extraordinary student at the Venezuelan Military Academy and even occupied the first academic positions and courses such as counterguerrillas, scuba diving,  and military parachuting and represented Venezuela as one of the best athletes in Military Pentathlon, after a explosion during the service as Second Lieutenant I lost parts of my body and &quot;I entrusted myself to God&quot; and ended up doing a Bachelor of Science at the American University in Washington, DC, I got a Red Belt at Tae Kwon do School in Arlington, VA, I was a diplomat in the USA, later I was taking the Basic, Medium and Advanced Courses for Allies with excellent grades at Fort Gordon, Georgia, USA and my adventure ended with a tour for a couple of years in Fort Gordon, as an Exchange Officer, I returned to Venezuela and followed my career as an Officer of the War Room of the Ministry of Defense, Officer of the Army War Room of the Commanding General, Assistants of the Army Commander General, Intelligence and Operations Officer of a Communications Battalion, Second Commander of a Communications Battalion, Commander of a Regiment-size Electronics Unit, Second Commander of a Infantry Brigade, Director of Computer Science of the Army Command, Director of Army Finance, Director of a Military University in Electronics, Founder of the Technical School of Officers of the FANB, upon returning to Venezuela I attended two Postgraduate Schools and in one of them I continued taking the &quot;President of the Republic Award&quot; and trophies as individual pistol shooting champion and group champion for the volleyball and softball team of the Army. The graduates of my Technical University graduated for 50 years as Superior Technicians, then my team managed to graduate them as Engineers. I was forced to separate from the military exercise for three years until I retired for thirty (30) for expressing disagreements with Decision Making that was adverse to my beliefs and principles and during all those years I suffered a lot of pain and losses and many satisfactions. Today I am a Full Professor at the National Experimental University of the FANB. I retired as Brigadier General and got up and carried on because I believed in God, my family and myself. Life does not end, I keep learning, growing and loving and I adore my family and my children. I am writing to you Mariana not for me, because most of all so that they know that not only your attitude, faith, will is important but also your family and your friends, without ever forgetting God.
great
真听不懂 ，不过女孩真漂亮自信

Spanish Mami.. She&#39;s hot
I came to learn English language but I learn her beautiful lifestyle
I got emotional listening to this. Very good!
Today I&#39;ve learned a new lesson from that. Thank you so much for sharing your advice, knowledge and experiences
Every person in this world has some thing different that&#39;s why everyone has genetic fingerprint different that&#39;s make the world a beautiful and different places to change the culture and civilization ... <br> But humanity remains shared between all people

Thank you Mariana for the great speech
if i only can be this successful. WOW
👍👍
Her parents gave her snap chat and a cell phone at age 7 tho
NICE PRESENTATION!  So she comes from a socialist, repressive government and supports Obama and Biden?  At least that is what I perceived.  Trump was for less government, more freedom, and better lives for all of us.  How do different people with different ideologies live together?  How do people that want a bigger government, that intrudes more into our personal lives work with people that want more personal freedoms, lower taxes, and smaller government.  How do people that believe in morals, the sanctity of life, and accountability to God live with people that believe anything should be acceptable or that the government can &quot;mandate&quot; anything?  How do people that care about the future and our planet live with people that pollute, destroy, litter and waste?  I don&#39;t know!  I sincerely ask these questions.  If anyone has a workable solution then please share it now!<br><br>I salute her optimism.  God bless.
I really enjoyed this speech. I mean,  she is so talented, so smart, so confident. I loved it. Beside all of that, she is Venezuelan.
she is well-done
Really great
Good speaker
thank you so much my love 😍
thank you, I love this :*
Everybody has great history,in tha fact that it didn&#39;t come again on one person

We cannot label others &quot;different&quot; because we are all different. Great speech.
She is already a special creature! She doesn’t need to do anything.
Honey...with your good looks, you are living on Easy Street. Everything I heard in your speech was simply a thing called life; we all go through hardships cupcake.

Brilliant 🔥! I learnt something new.
She is such a great speaker.

Mba ini secara ga langsung telah memperkenalkan apa itu makna toleransi yg sebenarnya...💙
That is mainly because, most people are immigrant there, and experienced those less friendly relationship! And they reaped those behaviour to next others!
She speaks really beautifully .I do wanna speak like that .I think it&#39;s impossible for me to be like her. She is open-minded too.
Her speech was really inspiring and she is really beautiful it is called beauty with the brain
She has a really amazing dad!
It was an incredible speech. There was so much to learn.

So beautiful♡
I believe most of you are here to learn English just like me, and we are just like what she said foreigners to those English speaking countries, and we can use this culture difference as advantage to stand out from others there just like her.

It is incredibly I am here to improve my listening skills, and I has learned an important lesson that changed my feelings.
&quot;You can&#39;t let differences define you&quot; - this is the most meaningful line for me. I&#39;m just in tears right now
The toughest task of all is “ NOT WORRYING ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES “   This girl is ALL about standing out.         Waste of a time watching this.      She’s Jumping around in a million subjects also.  Jeez
What this poor girl doesn’t know is that most people don’t need to know this because they already know how to appreciate others.   Sadly because of her upbringing she was only taught to judge people.  And it’s so nice to see that she broke past that .
I like her speech because I see her more confidence I found marian
👍👍👍👌👌👌😘😘😘
yeah, i agree , she&#39;s talented and pretty too
She speaks like a native speaker. <br>Her speech is powerful.<br>Accept differences of the others..<br>♥️♥️
I don&#39;t agree with you! Journalists aren&#39;t smart.
Her charisma is absolutely beautiful
she sos hottt omyghad
Thanks so much for sharing
Let&#39;s all celebrate the human race
She was special: pretty, smart, confident, and attractive. Mariana&#39;s talk has inspired me and made me more confident. Thank you! &lt;3
I admired her for her wisdom, the sharing of her life would help everybody to be better and that&#39;s really useful
Love this!
Very special TED, ❤️❤️❤️ message powerly!!!!
great line - &quot;what is on other people&#39;s pieces of paper&quot;
Good story teller
One speech last 17minute and so many things to learn.
I can stop watching the youtube short whenever I want 👍👍
Everyone is special. Only we don&#39;t speak English to talk about it.
Awesome 👏 talk!!!
Beautiful!
What a beautiful lesson to me tho! I came here just for the purposes of learning English, but I fell into her confidence and the way she clearly conveyed her speech, it&#39;s such a worth hearing speech ever.
Nice speeches held by a pretty European face are not the gist of the matter. She forgot that her heritage is the main reason, why she can hold nice speeches.
what makes me special?<br> Nothing 😥😥
i am watching this because i am learning english but it gives me more lessons in life
you made me cry
I came here for listening english. I swear i haven&#39;t already had enough changes in listening
ngl this is the best if not one of the best TEDx ive EVER seen
Good ony
From where this channel belongs ?
Im gonna die 😔😣
Behind every success have hardwork
She is very beautiful girl as well as good speaker with full on confidence . I listened her speech for improving English language. I really appreciate.
I would like to talk with you if want to learn English fluently too, i want ti talk with someone who can help me to improve my skills in english...To someone who read my comment..
It&#39;s a great story but i can&#39;t avoid feeling  some sort of superficiality on the things she says, is like trying to cover all themes at once trying to hit a point not matter what.
Thanks for sharing the experience which you have learn   throughout of your life .
You are very charming
my teacher take me to come here!
Remember, the core reminder to either set a powerful encouragement mindset. You&#39;re no alone whom are watching this, millions of them.
you are great human

Wonderful lesson I came here to learn English so I learned a important lesson
fine and fluent  speaker who understood  essence of  being  human
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=130">2:10</a>
This is the first time I see her. I feel like I&#39;ve found someone I really admire in mylife.  I really like her when I look and hear her said. <br>Her sound very strong and warm. I will be try to learn English well to can hear her said and learn from her more than.
I feel so sad for the so called educated cultured people who can not relate to a human being in a natural fashion ,not be driven by imposed  perceptions ,imposed by our broken culture and broken education system ; It is an inner strength and natural instinct to be able to see the other person as a full  potential person - don&#39;t let the inner strength die with you - it is imploring you to let it go and make yourself  complete.
Haiii rabiya latha
Cooolll!!!
I like her speech but if there is a law we abide by it, if America is not giving me citizenship i will not beg for it. i strongly believe that to have the freedom we need to have order too, to have order we cannot put our feelings first, yes I understand the humanity side
Thank you for sharing your story with us Mariana! As someone who has lived in other countries, it is important to celebrate and derive strength and fun from our differences. Peace everyone, glad we all watched this together :)
That was an intriguing story of life. My first aim of coming here is to learn English and I found way too much than that😊🤞

É o que penso também quando passarmos a nos tratar simplesmente como humanos querendo ajudar outros humanos sem levar em consideração muros, fronteiras, países, cor, raça, religião níveis sociais.  Estaremos nos elevando a um outro patamar, algo como uma elevação da alma. O bem de todos independente de ideologias e outras diferenças. É o que penso.

Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?

Curiosity is the spice of living life itself, the most curious one should be is in oneself, and what are we as individuals capable of achieving. Cultivate our imagination, this is yet an uncharted frontier very few really know anything about. Once this is accomplished we may venture into the curiosity of others and when we observe this we garner friends forever.

liked the lesson but jusssstt saying obama deported more people than trump did. you are part of the mainstream media, you should know they fear monger and it is simply sad that even an 8 year old feels it.
Can&#39;t wait till we all look at each other as humans rather than our color. I felt just as she did but for being white in a Latino community. Racism never wins. We should all love each other and if we can&#39;t don&#39;t make other people feel lesser because the way they were born. I think we are all beautiful.
I just dont get why desliked it? Like she&#39;s speaking facts

Different or indifferent justify judgment look in the mirror. I thought some of her comments were leading however the message was clear to me humanity or mankind is not normal. Mother nature does not judge.Did I miss something? Does God play a role in anything. I don’t care what you think that is your problem.
Hello friends, I&#39;m Himali Chakraborty and I&#39;m an Indian. Today, I just want to point out about Asia&#39;s cleanest village which is in Meghalaya , India. But, apart from that there is another place in Meghalaya which is Baghmara. I&#39;m an author and a freelancer and in my 2nd book , I have written and described about Baghmara and &quot;Turmeric city of India&quot; - Sangli. I request, all the viewers to read the book. It is a very nicely written book. <br>Book title - &quot;The Adventures of Tony Blue&#39;<br>Genre - Mystery &amp; Thriller<br>Those, who really want to explore these places could first do research apart from my book. But, the book would also flourish your college days and childhood days. <br>Don&#39;t judge it by it&#39;s cover.

Let’s celebrate our imperfections that make us special! Beautiful talk, she and her sister are inspirational!
so in shortcut what makes us different ?
The best speech I have ever seen OMG
We are really special, it depends on how other treat us the way we treat them as true, because we live in a judgemental society. Just barely remember that we are really great and special that God made as as his own image.
Fatima knows to belly dance???? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i really like your talk . it shocked me away. speacially about  yoursister accident. i am 11 years old.

What makes you different? You are made in the image of God. God loves you, seek Jesus it&#39;s who you&#39;re looking for.

This is a very awesome speech.

Everyone around the camp fire
The other looked at us that we are from another planet
And most of them have blue eyeswe have  international camp here
We get there and the first thing I noticed
I got really excited
May be it will be a little better
I didn&#39;t pay too much attention at that time u never know what the future hosts
From my very young age my parents
My story begins in the state of America where I grew up
Today I want to tell u;;;;;;; today I decided to tell you why I decided
I&#39;m a journalist my job is talk to people from  all walks of life;;;;;;;;;;all over the world
I am special
Every person is unique and we must embrace ourselves and others for who they are.We are humans first.Loved wen you said,we all r quirky.That&#39;s true!
Her speech motivated me, thanks a lot pretty girl and good luck with your job 🙂
The beauty of being different is love who you are and others for embracing it
Just one word: F A N T A S T I C.
Imperfections are what make you unique ...
Thanks 😊😊😊😊😊
I was just trying to look up Fallout stuff what
I watched TEDx Talks to make my English better.
I&#39;m from Malaysia, so what makes me different is when I started university. It made me more independent.
OMG .. it&#39;s serving the Diversity agenda. I&#39;m sorry.. *breaking off ... The Top Billionaires are the problem, not the people.
Being different is a blessing and a curse. That&#39;s what makes us humans: our differences.<br><br>I loved when she cited Voltàire. Even more when she spoke about how she tried to exercise her profession in Caracas. <br><br>I didn&#39;t emigrate to the States, but to Brazil, and being different have became my strongest bittersweet feeling when I think of my own humanity.<br><br>Naguará, gracias Mariana. La conferencia quedó chévere. Ojalá también vaya y dé un TedTalk algún día.
She is beautiful but I got bored of the speech at the minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=392">6:32</a>

The only way is to learn from Jesus loves everyone should have.
okay once she quoted &quot;Don&#39;t let those differences define you&quot;<br>but she also said that &quot;what makes me different is what has made me stand out&quot;<br>her whole speech supports the latter one. So the 1st line isn&#39;t quite meaningless?
This good to learn English very helpfull with easy speaking thanks ted&#39;s

really inspiring
She nail it!
OMG
So what you advocate is that everyone has a right to live in the USA, and then where will those who made that country go? Do you support that snake who just trespasses and occupies a hole that was dug by some other creature. Donald Trump stood between those who want to take over America and America. You all jointly knocked him down. Sad.
OMG she&#39;s gorgeous!!  (just saying)...  LOL   ;-)
I am back to learning english,listening english speeches😂😂
Fatima is a reason why this girl can show her mindset and educate us to not make label as &quot; others&quot; thanks for this beautiful mindlesson

america takes in 1,000,000 legal immigrants per year--and they bring new ideas, and perspectives...that may maintain the survival of this country. they have much to teach us; i only hope we listen to them. many of us take america for granted--they dont.
Love the way she Speaks👍💐
This speech also show us the importance of presence and support of parents in our life..

At first when I listened to this video I couldn&#39;t understand everything but after a long time of training English and IELTS, I could make sense of all of information that she gave in her speech. I presumed it was meaningful and I felt extremely epic because my English ability was enhanced

Much like the speech of religious or non-religious preachers for centuries and centuries<br>Afterwards, the truth beaten and the lie disguised as truth.
Voltaire did not say (or write) &quot;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it&quot;. That is a quote from Evelyn Beatrice Hall, in &quot;The Friends of Voltaire&quot;, 1906, ( in the London Smith, Elder, &amp; Co. edition is at  p. 199)

whether you give the opportunity to people who talk against Democrats party? oh definitely no. therefore you don&#39;t know humanity and you are not human. do make exaggerate everything. you always blame P.TRump. but  you don&#39;t want to see reality in the world. I am immigrant, too. But I don&#39;t think I should come here and destroy America and life of people. I am here and I am thankful from American who gave me this opportunity to live peacefully in the USA. sham on the people that come to the USA and work against this lovely people.
So inspiring my eyes fulfilled with tears
At first, I believe that I am just the one who normal person. I mean I have no special things that appealing others just the normal person. But actually is not true. Each person has the unique way. I can&#39;t be the others and the others can&#39;t be like me.
Don&#39;t panic, you aren&#39;t special, and that&#39;s okay! Meditate on that ;-)
Definitely one day I&#39;ll share my success story on this auditorium.

Donald J Trump is the best President we have ever had. He is not the bad guy like the media has brainwashed you to believe.<br>Illegal aliens hurt America in many ways. They don’t pay taxes,. If they commit a crime they aren’t held accountable so what’s to stop them from doing it again. If they love this country so much embrace our language and our culture. Why should we change our ways to accommodate you. We didn’t ask you to come here, but if you abide by the laws of the land, that means gaining citizenship, maybe you can stay.

Donald Trump doesn&#39;t represent all those bad things you think.  You were fed all those lies by a virulent left-wing media hellbent on demonizing anyone who isn&#39;t on the progressive bandwagon, calling them any names that will stick.  You are being manipulated emotionally, and led about like sheep.  Trump isn&#39;t great, by any stretch, but your suave and charismatic politicians who says exactly what you want to hear, are not being honest; or they simply leave out the inconvenient truths.  They talk about how granting citizenship to illegal immigrants is compassionate, but never about how it would incentivize further illegal immigration and exascerbate the problem.  They like to conflate legal and illegal immigration.  They appeal to your emotions, your decency, your moral sensibilities, and get you to drop your critical thinking.  In Trump, you have a truth speaker (albeit it&#39;s his personal truth, he is not lying to himself like the career politicans), even if that&#39;s not what the majority of the sheep want to hear.<br><br>This lady is lucky she didn&#39;t get a thumbdown from me, because she had the wisdom of quoting Voltaire.
Excellent talk!<br>Keep us inspiring this way. <br>Be happy😍😍

القيمة الحقيقية ليس لأنك تتقن العديد من اللغات او لأنك صاحب بشرة او شكل مميز او ان لديك ثروة طائلة او لأنك من عرق معين بل القيمة الحقيقة هي انك على دين الإسلام انك مؤمن بالله وتطيع الله.. لان المال ربما يتبخر والجمال ربما يذهب والعرق انت لست مسؤل عنه... هاذا هوا الميزان الحق.. لانه حتى من تعلم اللغات ربما لم تتوفر الفرصة للجميع والامكانيات التي توفرت لك

I came here to learn English only. But I get thing more
Pretty girl, good lesson to learn btw
Hi i was surprised we have the same surname of my mother
Came here to wait until class starting but i found perfect lecture thank you mrs
I&#39;m always trying to satisfy others&#39; tastes so I think I am not living as myself should be. I used to consider myself a strange girl and even didn&#39;t want others to say anything &#39;bout me &#39;cause I&#39;m scared of being gone off. However, after watching this, I realized that I&#39;m not weird, I&#39;m just different and that&#39;s me, not someone else who lives and depends on the world&#39;s style. Now I feel much better and that&#39;s it!!!
Nothing, have a good night.
wow this touched me more than ever. it also explained something that seemed to have no answer to me, &quot;why did my case seem different?&quot;
Very inspirational. Love this, taught me so much about life.

Im really surprised with the horrible algorithm of comments this video has
I loved!
A beautiful speech and a touching one too. Hope the audience can take away from this and perhaps change their view on people of a different colour or gender. Thank you for this speech it has opened my eyes to things I never thought about. Everyone is special.
All mankind human beings are special.
She certainly is a great story teller.

This is beautiful .....I need to watch something like that being &quot;Egyptian hijabi muslim girl&quot;
God makes every one special because we were made in his image.   The gospel for salvation 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 and read Romans 10:9-10.  The power of God  1 Corinthians 1:18-23  and Romans 1:16-17. The warning Galatians 1:8 and Romans 2:16.    &quot;Where will you spend eternity?&quot; For those who stay lost Revelation 20:14-15. Use a KJV bible.
It is such a scenario.....story telling behing one&#39;s speach doesn&#39;t work anymore for me. Speech where someone try to gain empathy by telling us sad story where he/she is either victim himself or someone close to him suffered. Look at all X factor, America got Talent most watched videos and you will find same pattern. Instead of person who is supposed to perform and sing or do something they try to get more simpathy simply by telling us their sad story and I have feelign that almost all participants are either with some disease, beaten as kids by their parents or they went through tough moments in their life or they lost someone. But Hey wait a minute!.....it happens to all of us. We are all humans and we all lose people, relatives, we all have bad things that happen in our life. Why should we try to use this as base for our speach or perfrormance just to make more views/likes/audience and popularity. Its already know fact and producers get use of this to manipulate the audience.
you are all special &lt;3
such a beautiful lesson of life.
She’s so beautiful!😁
Her şeyi o kadar güzel anlattı ki. Tek kelimeyle mükemmel:)
I can listen to her speak my whole life.
Learning
Why people I know just able to judge me<br>Cuz they trained well to be such a good corrector <br>It is fine with me as long as I do the right things for myself and my family
There is one thought in my mind... Many people learn or improve their English watching Ted Talks. I wonder, may be smd of native speakers here want to chat in the social nets? As for me, figure skating or studing in the University can be the themes of our communication.
Thanks for your insights. they are very inspirational in seeing others from different perspectives, thus promoting wisdom and understanding that gives hope for a better world.  I must say I like your personal style - the strong emotionally controlled and intelligent way you identified yourself and family as being the &#39;other&#39; and yet the &#39;normal&#39; and &#39;familiar&#39; person,  that reflects the personality and character of people found everywhere
I AM FROM CARACAS, VENEZUELA AND I JUST SHOCKED WITH THIS AMAZING TEDTALK 😍😍😍

I am a slow speaker because I cannot think of the words to say fast enough. Yet I have written a book called THE POWER OF UNITY and other insights from God. It should be out and online by September-October 2021. It spiritually prepares people for the second coming. It covers many topics for a small book, including &#39;The map of the Human heart&#39; and the Great Pyramid  : the Bible in stone. It talks about the difference between lust and love.
I&#39;ve been learning english for the last ten months. It makes me proud what I have achieved when I look back and I notice that my english was really poor. Also I know that I have to improve a lot!!

I do not understand why people come to the United States either breaking immigration laws or over stay their temporary visit, become an illegal alien and then blame the laws the United States has for what they did.  There is only so much room in a country and the United States cannot accept everyone that applies for immigration.  We allow many aliens in, permanently and temporarily but do not break our immigration laws and then place the blame on the United States.  <br><br>If I went to another country and broke their immigration laws on purpose I would expect to be punished.  And the United States is pretty nice about how we enforce immigration laws compared to many countries out there in the world.
She is beautiful and not real.

Those were not the words of Voltaire, but of one biographer of Voltaire who put part of her own sentence in quotemarks for style reasons, accidentally made people believe that it was Voltaire&#39;s writing.
Love you girl and thanks for your sharing and teaching
Wow 💓awesome speech
you speak very fast ahhahaha but I know
I think you have a troubled personality because you want to fit yourself in the U.S culture, feeling shortage from being non American citizens and this is what makes you anxious. I don&#39;t see any problem from being that. I raised in a culture that anyone dreams it. The only reason who enforce me to listen to your (sorry) shortage reflexes is to learn the E language to complete my study only. Every time i listen to you i thanks to allah who guide me to the Islam religion. And I hope the speaker read about islam she will surprise what Quran tells about the differences between people. The country how find out the racism is the U. S honestly.
Great I just want to became that person who will give speed like u on the top stage

Love your wife and children. They are Your Choices, Not Themselves. For this reason, Treat them with more &quot;Love and Affection.&quot; They are Your Responsibility. The Responsibility You Have Decided to Take.<br>&quot;Love Jehovah your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength.&quot;<br>These words that I am commanding you today must be in your heart, and you must inculcate them to your children and speak of them while sitting at your house, walking along the road, lying down and getting up. &quot;(Deut 6: 5-7)<br><br>&quot;Parents, do not irritate your children, but continue to raise them in Jehovah&#39;s discipline and instruction.&quot;<br>&quot;Children are an inheritance from Jehovah; the fruit of the womb is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, So are the children of a young man.&quot; (Eph 6: 4; Ps 127: 3,4)<br><br>&quot;Husband, continue to love your wife, just as Christ loved the congregation and gave himself up for her. Likewise, the husband must love his wife as his own body. The man who loves his wife, loves her. himself, for no man has ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does for the congregation, yet each of you love your wife as yourself; on the other hand, your wife must have deep respect for her husband. &quot; (Eph 5: 25,28,29,33)

Ted-talks are so addictive😋☺️, I love to watch them , Everytime a new notifications of Ted pops out on my phone, I am over the moon🥳,
I think her name is very unique. I also have the name Mariana. I like to see it because its very rare.
it was good to see
Ya Allah ampunilah dosa kami semua yang setuju like.
One of the best TED Talks ever. So much of sense in being humane. Beautifully explained with a profound &amp; exhaustive vocabulary.  I bow down with deep respects ✊ to this lady.
Wonderful message, if you are lucky enough to be different, never change!
We judge each other and the way we see each other is not so pure. We fight for our loved ones and we ignore enemies. Sometimes our enemies can become our true friends with just a kind word. Sometimes our loved can be also turned into big enemies. So everything is not permanent or fixed.  Therefore, we must  love equally to every sentient beings.  With love &amp; compassion, it can open up a new world, by creating less &amp; less sins.
Being different is an advantage !!! ❤️❤️ Lovely mam wonderful speech .got some bliss in my 💓 thnqq Mariana mam luv u ...... 🥰🥰

تعليق الخاص موجه الى كل شخص يتحدث باللغة العربية هذي نصيحتي لك <br>😍😍😍😍😍 There is an English translation for every friend I don&#39;t know😍😍😍<br>وما نيلُ المطالبِ بالتَّمني<br>ولكن تُؤخَذُ الدُّنيا غلابَا<br>وما استعصى على قومٍ منالٌ<br>إذا الإقدامُ كان لهم ركابَا<br><br>لتحقيق أهدافنا،علينا :<br>التوكل على الله،والثقة في أنفسنا،ويلزمنا العزيمة والإرادة والسعي الدؤوب،وقتل التردد،وكثير من الصبر.<br>لا تلجؤوا إلى النوم كي تحلموا بنجاحاتكم،بل اجعلوا من نجاحكم حقيقة،البسوه ثوب الواقع ،لا برنس الخيال.<br>اجتهدوا واسعوا ،فلكل مجتهد نصيب.لا ترجعوا إلى الوراء،مهما كان العائق، فالمقاومة والمثابرة،أساس من أسس النجاح.فلأن نقضي زمنا بين السقوط والنهوض،خير من أن نقضي العمر باكين متحسرين على حلم ضاع،وأمل تسرب كالرمل من بين أصابعنا.<br>عن الإصرار أتحدث. <br>And we do not receive the demands of wishful thinking<br> But the world shall be conquered<br> What is impossible for a people to obtain<br> If boldness had stirrups<br><br> To achieve our goals, we must:<br> Trust in God, and trust in ourselves, and we need determination, will, and tireless pursuit, killing hesitation, and a lot of patience.<br> Do not resort to sleep in order to dream of your successes, but make your success a reality. Wear it in reality, not the robe of imagination.<br> Work hard and expand, for every mujtahid has a share. Do not go back, no matter what the obstacle, for resistance and perseverance are one of the foundations of success. Because we spend time between falling and rising, it is better than spending a lifetime crying over a lost dream, and hope that seeps like sand from between our fingers.<br> I am talking about persistence.

There is only one problem, I am too indifferent, l am nothing and I am so different because I am nothing, no strengths, they same weaknesses as everyone else. I am not depressed or anything, rather even the opposite I just always assumed that if I am nothing I could just be everything too. Still I am very very empty on the inside, not emotionally, just bland
I love the episode
Being different means thinking differently...amazing speech
I m special becoz i m born in a educated family and i love 2 read books, travel and learn from others experience.

What makes me special? Not you. LOL! Nah, I&#39;m special just standing here, don&#39;t need to be told that. Go girl for those who do.
@Prof MATH DZ  <br>LO! RELIGION WITH ALLAH IS <br>ISLAM  <br>  إن الدين عند الله الإسلام و من يبتغ غير الإسلام دينا فلن يقبل منه o <br>Islam is دين الله (Way of Life given by Allah). How mankind should live in this world. It is not made by Muslim. It has it&#39;s root in Qur&#39;an and authentic حدیث (sayings of Prophet) Therefore Islamic laws are better than any other law of the world. <br><br>Problem of Europe is that it does not understand this very important  fact. They think that theirs  law is better  than  Islamic law. <br><br>Almighty Allah says :<br>The revelation of the Book is from Allah,the Mighty, the Wise.<br><br>Lo! We have revealed the Book unto them (Mohammad)  with truth; so worship Allah,making the Deen pure for Him (only). <br><br>Surely pure Deen is for Allah only<br>                                   (Qur&#39;an,39:1-3)<br>Kindly make your mind clear that the the mankind is created by Almighty Allah -- the Master Creator.  <br>We have to study and research the Holy Qur&#39;an sincerely. It is in broader  interests of humankind.<br><br>Follow Islam to make your life better in this world and in the life of Hereafter.  <br>O Allah show us the right path of Islam. <br>&quot; The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not (the path) of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go stray&quot;.<br>                                   (Qur&#39;an, 1:7)<br>                              <br>DR.MOHAMMAD LAEEQUE NADVI <br>Ph.D. (Arabic Lit.)

Everyone is unique but not be special. Anyway effective TEDx.
I&#39;m here to improve my English language ( listening) I don&#39;t understand everything what she said but I will try and try even I will talk like her one day
If we stop judge people not  only by their looks but also their heart  the world  will become very beautiful

What makes you special?
That&#39;s not the only thing we have in common. Millions and billions of similarities even with plants. We can&#39;t even comprehend the connection with our small window brains.
Beautiful words❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just imagine a world, where we can celebrate our differences, feel included and embrace our humanity ... Can you? Dare to dream ... make it happen, every day and every moment.

Nice !!! 😊😊😊
Nice thought but Middle East = belly dancing?<br>Whaaaat!!
Life is all about unpredictable things in our life. Just to be yourself and be your special version of you. Thanks for sharing!
For three years if I’m not wrong, I scrolled on youtube and see this one video pops up almost all the times, but this is the very first time my monkey mind bring me here and to the core. In simple word, she is awesome and I hope she will continue to strengthen her personal growth and y’all too.
&quot;Being able to re-imagine yourself BEYOND what other people see&quot; <br>Hit me hard❗✔✔ Thank you TEdx
anyone from 2020 ? {corona guys}
Nice speech, but the privalege spills out of her whole speech. &quot;Yes they broke the law and should pay a penalty for it,&quot;  not everyone has a rich daddy that can get them out of their country when they are in danger like hers did. She obviously doesn&#39;t understand just how difffult that procress is and its close to imposible when you don&#39;t have money.
She&#39;s so beautiful
She&#39;s too pretty for ted talk its distracting me
xxxx
So beautifully explained 👏 <br>I didn&#39;t want this to end.
you know what is happening here: all we need is someone ”beautiful”, and more people like her (or him in other cases) will come. This is the power of people, so you out there ”beautiful” people just come togheter. (just read the comments and you will know what I mean)..
I really inspire with your conversation.i am sociologist I want to learn a lot things from you. Its a very informative video
Diversity is the biggest strength!

Thank you TEDx Talks from your videos it has encouraged me to understand life from many positive perspectives and empower myself to learn from many people around the world to have awareness and care to things happen in our environment. My best regards for all inspiring speakers here from Indonesia.
Thanks a world from Mariana Atencio! when I heard and watched this video on that time i really felt that something makes me special, like teaching it makes me special.
Thanks, very good share
She taught me to live.❤️
Keeping other things aside, I must say You are too beautiful.
A privileged, aristocratic girl &quot;feeling like a refugee&quot; when going to the US to finish her studies with a scholarship after spending most of her summer vacations in the US paid by her father is almost cruel.
if you want God to forgive you dont commet here just go to the church and pray.
I&#39;m in love with her self-confidence...and the topic is really important.
I love that I&#39;m different. I am confident and I know im special. Everything you go through in your life good or bad, take it in because that&#39;s what makes you who you are, a one special Individual. Peace and love💘 愛と平和❤
thank you so much for your lesson

Thanks Mariana , I really liked your conference. I think that I am different to others because I wanted to get out of the comfort zone , so I quiet  my job for travel to another country for studyng English . However I couldn’t travel due to the pandemic  and the borders are closed and I thought , omg what did I do? Without work , study , etc... But in this moment I was watching videos for learning English and practice in many ways, and I know that I took a good  decision because I feel that I have grown in many aspect of my life , and I know that the time will come to fulfill our dreams.

Thank you so much for this extremely inspiring video. You rose my spirits and touched my heart to the point of crying.
&quot; But she taught me: you can&#39;t let those differences define you &quot; Such an amazing lesson in life
Smash!!
Indian people hit like...
wow
What makes you special ?<br> Find out 👌
Miss Karina thank you so much
&quot; But she taught me: you can&#39;t let those differences define you &quot; Such an amazing lesson in life
I like this woman because what makes us special is to be different. Do not try to compare ourselves to others. Know what our strengths and values are. You can make a difference today. Thank you!
This story is very good madam I&#39;m from India
Thank you for that
Very well conveyed msg, there are many success stories around me but they don&#39;t have the communication skills to convey it to the world.
Thanks
Who came here to learn English
XXXXX
Beautiful
You are such an inspiring wonderful women! I came here coincidentally while I were looking for something else but figured out one of the most inspiring speeches I have ever seen! I really needed to hear this!
wow! What a great speech.. <br><br>I totally agree with Mariana. Also, I liked Voltaire&#39;s quote, it is my favourite motto.. <br><br>Greetings from Turkey!
Really very inspiring and impressive speech. Love from INDIA.
Quite interesting topic, inspiring as well, I am glad you have realized how important to treat people equally. There is a bit which I think you have missed it, understanding other culture because somehow it&#39;s related to your topic. I will go back to the girl which you met and gave her your &quot;other* look, and how sorry you feel the way you treated her. My question here, did you ask for her permission to publish her photo? Or it&#39;s the arrogant again which gives you to right to publish bcz she is the other!!!

This is one of the most inspiring TED talks that I&#39;ve ever watched. It is also becoming my most favorite TED talks ever. Thank you for saying this louder, maam. &quot;We are all different. We are all quirky, and unique, and that is what makes us wonderfully human&quot; and my tears fell down, couldn&#39;t agree more!

This is a gem. Thanks, TEDx!
Your question...what makes you special?<br>My answer...my fingerprints, and my eyes....because just like everyone else on the planet....they are unique to me.<br>We are as unique as our fingerprints, unique as snowflakes...all wonderful in our own way....will we ever realise and celebrate that?<br>I hope so....THAT is MY dream...I want to understand the differences....I want to be open to celebrating individuality.<br><br>Thank you for your Soul-searching talk.
we can know what make us different and know what others make different, but not certainly accept the difference because no love. the only way how to make peace among people is love. as the bible command &quot;love your neighboor hood as you love your self&quot; and above all of that &quot;love your God above everything&quot;. you can accept your sister because you love her as who she is despite her condision.
I am from the middle east  I went to USA and almost everyone treated me like a freak they either avoided me or was rude. <br>I am a woman in veil and a proud Muslim<br>I remember going to Disneyland <br>a man smiled at  me and told me I am glad u are here madam ,I really needed his words I smiled back and thanked his kindness<br>He was a man who saw my difference and accepted it<br> in a wonderful way<br>We all need to be like him <br>,thank you, amazing tedtalk

Us much us Allah that&#39;s very beautiful topic keep going every time
Worth it
I actually came here to practice my english and learn more but I ended up motivated by such an amazing speaker  I really loved the way she speaks and walks us through the motivation and the idea that&#39;s so impressive to be different in a community of people that are corresponded somehow ,I really respect and worship those people whose thoughts are rather differently worded and could start the wheels of change

I&#39;ve been watching TED videos for a quite long time and noticed one common thing among them: something terrible always happens in narrator&#39;s life
Thanks mam
She wouldnt success if she were not look like a model
What makes you S.P.E.C.I.A.L.? Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck.
&quot;when you&#39;re different you have to work at belonging&quot; personal attacc🙆
Who only came here to learning English speaking
I liked, great speech
Wow amazing speech<br><br>The Quran says” O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you.”
I&#39;m very impressed. Thank you so much.. I realized something really important for my life. People who change the world are someone like you.
Correction, The Obama administration deported more inmigrants than Donald Trump did.
Sólo debía ver 5 min para una tarea, pero me termino llevando una gran reflexión.
Only way to know you&#39;re special traits you need see yourself from outside perspective
Anyone in from future?
People only care about how you look. :&lt;
Well whose fault is it if the family gets deported? Not the Presidents, but the parents for braking the law. Because they can save up money to apply to be legal here, why risk it to be deported? My mom didn’t know English, and had a humble job, she managed to save up money to apply to make us legal. And so i thank my mom for not blaming the President and expecting everything for free, but for putting her faith into action. If you want to be blessed by God do the right thing. 🤍
Mariana felicidades 👏💐 <br>Love from Turkey <br>💕
شكرا للمترجم اذا ماقال (ضحك) ماكناا عرفناا😂😂

anyone after corona crisis!!
she so beautifull
everything in me should make me feel special. But hard to make myself believe it. When i see anyone that i think better than me, i felt like &quot;the other&quot;. Hm
I like how she brings up how boys dresses like girls, now it&#39;s just called femboys but I would say it&#39;s more than that most likely cultural or their own personality being expressed.
I love your dad
The only thing that we have in common it is that be humans
So Mariana Atencio travels to the USA and then expresses her hate about the way the US people voted?  How rude and disrespective of her!
Superb speech for forever
Anyone in 2020 ??? I&#39;m Coronavirus pleasea bless for me
Excellent speech.
she taught us a very valubale lesson
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=397">6:37</a> Well Mariana, if you&#39;re looking for a dance, just say the word and i&#39;ll get the flight booked 😍😂😉<br><br>Congrats on the 27m views, THAT is a number! 😉
Great TedTalk !
Every country has immigration laws and what do you mean they’ve given everything ?! No the men and women that have given their life for THEIR freedom have given everything these people come and broke laws disrespectfully.
She’s very lucky to have a family with resources
She must have come from a wealthy family
Me too can we create a group is it interesting?

كلامك جميل جدا عجبني وحفزني شكرا <br>I&#39;m stay in Egypt
I want to be special, meanwhile 2020 saw me as a potential terrorist, and says :are u serious man...
I always say to myself that each and everyone of us in this life possess something special that nobody can ever have ..whether small or big that is what makes you different and unique..You are special in your own simple way ❤
I love her voice
*Video opening<br>What makes you special?<br>Mariana:Nothing, thank you and goodbye
In our holy quran in sura 49aya 13<br>O mankind, we have created you and appointed you races and tribes, that you may know one another. Surely the noblest among you in the sight of God is the most god-fearing  of you.
She&#39;s smart and brave..
She talks shallow, but people like this vid becoz simp!

So what make me speech fluently and swept my audience along with me like as you. How i admire you! I take off my hat on you &lt;3 &lt;3
I am crying😢😭
When she talked about Muslim girl and her reaction when met her . I felt sad because many people don&#39;t accept the muslim girl .  It is true that She changed her thinking about that girl but many people don&#39;t change their thinking about  us 🙁🙁
I m special that I born in India🖤🇮🇳<br>Nd I m proud to be an Indian
Wow

Video Title: &quot;What Makes You Special?&quot; <br><br>Me: <b>I didn&#39;t say I&#39;m special! Stop putting words in my mouth!</b>
I came here just to practice my English listening and I realized we were born in the same country 🥺❤️
Bahrain = Belly dancing?  I think you&#39;re in need of more REAL growth and understanding of otherness / difference. But you do seem perfect for what&#39;s now called TV journalism.
She was born in a very rich family.
she remind me to the song &quot;scar to your beautiful&quot; alessia cara
Excellent ted talk ever heard before, thank you, Mariana by giving us such a deep thinking lecture. What makes me special and makes me outstanding.
each is unique, no one is the same
What an insight. Thank you!
Nobody has claim on the word &quot;normal&quot;❤
We&#39;re all different 😍
I just watched videos on how to improve my Grammar and then I got here :D
I purposely watched Tedtalk with intention to learn English better, plus, my English teacher encouraged me to watch this for my upcoming presentation. Instead, I learnt how to value myself. That&#39;s actually good. Kill two birds with one stone.
Nobody has a claim on the word &quot;normal.&quot; We are all different. We are all quirky, and unique, and that is what makes us wonderfully human :)
Videoyu izlerken anlamlandıramadığım bir şekilde gözyaşı döktüm. Anneannem bir Bulgaristan göçmeni. Küçükken herkesten farklı bir göz yapımın olması gerçekten kırıcıydı, okuldan eve gelip kaç saat boyunca ağladığımı ve neden diye sorduğumu hatırlıyorum. Neden ben böyleyim, neden onlar gibi &#39;NORMAL&#39; bir göz yapım yok, o zamanlar bunun ne olduğunu neden dışlandığımı anlayamazdım. Ama artık biliyorum. Gözlerimi kocaman açıp aynaya baktığımı, küçük parmaklarımla göz kapaklarımı genişletmeye çalıştığımı asla unutamam. Ama şimdilerde fark ediyorum ki ben özelim, böyleyim ve her halimle çok güzelim.THE OTHERS olduğumuz gerçeğini ve bizim gibi ÖTEKİLER olduğunu fark edeli uzun zaman oluyor. Amerikalılar Donald Trump la 2016 dan bu zamana dünyayı 2 ye ayırdı. AMERİKAN PEOPLE AND OTHERS.. Ve George Floyd&#39;la birlikte bir şeylerin değişmeye başladığını; siyahilerin, müslümanların terörist ya da ötekiler olarak görülmemesi gerektiğinin bilincinde olan birçok insanın olduğu biliyorum ya da öyle umut ediyorum. Bir gün ırkçılığın hiç olmadığı bir dünya hayal ediyorum.
We r different she was aww
İngilizcem olaydi keşke

മലയാളികൾ ഉണ്ടോ?
TED,ペラペラしゃべる人がほとんどですね、記憶したことを流してるだけ。考えながら、少し詰まりながら、ゆっくり語ってくれる方いませんかーーー笑いも要りません。
This is a beautiful TED Talk and still relevant today. By far one of my favorites.
İnsan olmayı ne güzel anlatmış, güzel kız.
Now, We all see, Donald Trump will drown The whole country and many people will die because of it.
too excellent speech buddy
Very Inspiring!

Hola 2020 cómo están?

I like your voice so much, it’s like a special magnet that draws me to listening to you and I realised this is my second time listening to the same talk
Your words made me tear up.. especially when mentioning Fatima. I can relate. Although I&#39;m a professional and don&#39;t give in to any of those ethnic or racial definitions, it hurts to see this prejudgment from ppl I meet for the first time. They have questions they don&#39;t dare to ask.. and choose their bubbles.. Feeling like a stranger everyday.. Would love to see the world have more ppl that see others the way you do. Thanks Mariana!!
EVERYONE READING MY COMMENT!!!🙆<br>Tell me what makes you a special person❔❔👍💯<br>And also tell me that what did you guys learnt from the video❓❕ <br>Hurry up ☺️<br>I&#39;m waiting for your reply😉🌈
I came here to learn English then I surprised that she talks about a girl from my country  Bahrain... What a coincidence<br><br>She was very convening when she said that we are all different so we are all special. Ignore them if they tell you are normal
Such a strong ending, love it!

I am following all knowledge all channels but people think our subscribers are very low thats why people not even watching our videos also what we are saying about..
She is special really
She&#39;s the best
This woman is not special ,-she is promoting herself as special ,-but she is playing the Victim Card to get attention .
I don&#39;t know what makes me different 😔

If people don&#39;t feel sad for her sister in a wheelchair than should they feel pity or something else? Its human nature to feel sad and hope the sick person gets well. I was agreeing with everything until she said that
Bless you people in these comments!I am so happy to look at the comments and see how we support each other💚💚A special thank you I want to say for motivation speak!I feel like she&#39;s saying what I always say and it made me understand that Im not alone👍
I want to hear the speaking again and again, I can’t get most of the meaning, but I feel the meaning which  the speaker expressed is very meaningful! And her speaking is very fluently!
what make you so special is what you love cause no one can love the same thing cause the things have not the same importance to us cause of our story ....
If we were all the same.....man life would be so boring!
Yesss yessss yesssss✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
I want become special person in my eyes and everyone ...
I am a wheelchair bounded girl i can&#39;t walk but i am confident, independent and educated girl, at my early age i accepted myself the way i am, but unfortunately the society would never allow you to live with peace. Whenever i go outside shopping,or go to the restaurants or any other place people look at me like if i have come from an another planet! I can see sympathy in their eyes for me clearly. Some people come to chat with me directly to tell how much they feel sorry for me. That literally hurts. By the grace of Allah i am strong enough to deal with all this,i never let anyone to destroy my inner peace. But i feel for those people like me who are differently abled and they cannot face people&#39;s behaviour towards them. They lock themselves in their homes and spend the rest of their lives like this! I wish people could understand once that their single word can break/destroy someone&#39;s soul, their confidence their strength to face the world. I wish people see different people as social instead of weird.
De ce vorbesti de acel presedinte dinainte de Trump? Acel om si partidul lui,  a discriminat comunitatile normale, impunand practici care nu sunt acceptate de nici o cultura din lume, de nici o traditie. Au fost taiate fondurile de bani pentru scoli , doar pentru a le obliga sa favorizeze oameni cu probleme, care credeau ca sunt femei cand ei erau barbati si toate sistemele lor hormonale sustineau asta. A sustinut pe cei care au persecutat pe crestinii din orientul mijlociu. Acei crestini au fost omorati ca in evul mediu fiind decapitati spanzurati arsi. Au fost puse filmarile pe net.  Stiai asta domnisoara? Trump sustine ceea ce e corect si normal la fel ca traditiile milenare ale omenirii. Oamenii erau scarbiti de ce abuzuri si incalcari ale drepturilor omului s-au facut inainte si l-au votat pe Trump.
Nu ai inteles nimic. Toti suntem oameni dar printre noi sunt infractori , violatori traficanti de fete ca tine, care nu mai vad lumina zilei si mor intr o camera violate. Nu e normal domnisoara , ca oamenii sa se teama de acesti infractori? Nu e normal sa se fereasca de ei? Tu dai vina tot pe cei normali care nu fac rau? Tot oamenii corecti sunt vinovati , ca le e frica de traficanti si vor sa se separe de ei , sau sa nu ii vada printre ei? <br>Mai e cineva care discrimineaza... codul penal. El spune ca daca cineva face o infractiune trebuie sa fie pedepsit. Daca spune asta inseamna ca discrimineaza minoritatile? El pedepseste pe oricine e vinovat indiferent de culoare, chiar daca e din minoritate! <br>Asta fac si oamenii, doresc sa nu mai fie printre ei oameni care ii lovesc, fura, agreseaza, vand droguri ! De aceea arata cu degetul, spre unii. Pt ca aceia fac rau !!! Daca toti se incadreaza in limitele legale, nimeni nu ar avea ceva cu cineva.
Why are you talking about that president before Trump ? That man and his party, discriminated against normal communities, imposing practices that are not accepted by any culture in the world, by any tradition. Funds were cut for schools, just to force them to favor people with problems who thought they were women when they were men and all their hormonal systems supported it. He supported those who persecuted Christians in the Middle East. Those Christians were killed as in the Middle Ages being beheaded and hanged. The videos were posted on the net. Did you know that, miss? Trump supports what is right and normal just like the millennial traditions of mankind. People were disgusted by human rights abuses and violations before and voted for Trump.
You are so intelligent
I just watch this over and over again
That&#39;s one of the most inspiring ted talk I&#39;ve ever heard.
I need more practice speaking. I am changing job. Any idea for me?
We all are different in some way or another. But after all, we are humans.
She looks so beautiful ❤️
I have a special mind desease which I always avoid to talk about it but it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m crazy ( this word is frecuently used for people &amp; it may hurt other people) Now what makes me special: My family Love&#39;s me &amp; I love them, I&#39;m trying to review the  English language , my native language Is Spanish, I Love  poetry, I have danced for more than 3 years before, I believe in God, love to sing when is rainy &amp; I&#39;m a person who loves nature. A person who try to share with other people and who likes yo encourage people too.

i came here to imitate here  for improving my accent. but i got awesome life lesson. and really being imperfect connect you with many people so i don&#39;t why people want to be become perfect. so let&#39;s embrace our imperfectness
full of inspiration
You are so cute and very smart
Very good
I am sure being hot female did not have any influence on her overall experience xDDD<br>Sorry, but whenever attractive people dare to teach social skills and/or tell how we are all equal and special, it makes me wanna puke.
This is from experience finding what ur good or ur talent will take along time to find it took me 17 yrs and I only found mine last month and it’s not even that good I wouldn’t class it as a talent it’s something that I can do better than most people and that is learning how to do thing really quick give me anything and if I really try I can learn something in under 5 mins not everything eg maths or spelling (I’m dyslexic so I find them hard) but if someone tells me to learn to play a game on Xbox I will have all the controls and be better than the person in less than an hour I played this game called brawlhalla and all my friends have been playing it for nearly 4months now I have been playing just under 4 weeks and I’m better than most of my friends that play it. I am saying this because just because I have a disability with learning doesn’t mean I can’t learn it just means I have to work harder to learn that certain thing. <br><br><br><br><br>Thank for reading idc what anyone thinks about this u don’t like it move on and ignore it no need to start an argument. If u liked it thank you no need to leave a like either unless u want.
I just wanna know what mins is the thumbnail?
I have always cursed myself for being overly emotional and sensitive but I know that will make me stand powerful some day..
Very good
We are all living in this not-so big planet. What makes us worthy is our special unique persona. We all need to sherish other&#39;s uniqueness. We need to grow an actitude towards kindness and inclusive emotions. That would make the world change big time!
We all should appreciate the unique world of others, no matter how far their culture or home values are. We all need to grow into kindness for humanity at large. That would make a huge change in the world.
If everyone is perfect<br>Then<br>Everyone is same,not different,no speciality.<br>BE DIFFERENT<br>STAND OUT
Thank you so much for the beautiful message 🤧
When she speaks of feeling out of place as an outsider when she was younger, I&#39;m thinking, literally every kid feels that at some point, whether they&#39;re from another country, another state or just a kid starting in a new school. Everybody goes through that and you just have to work through it hoping that time and experience will help you overcome. I think the real message here, and where Mariana is such an inspiration is, if you&#39;re an awkward kid, feeling different and &quot;other,&quot; you&#39;re not alone and this is part of the general human condition... and looking at Mariana&#39;s example, one day you will own the room just by showing up. Mariana is a lovely woman and she carries herself with confidence, class and grace.
What makes me special is my strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, and luck
I cried to hear this. I’m Japanese. When I went to NewZealand, they looked me as stranger. I thought we should accept the differences.<br>Thank you.
I am special because i have a son who looks up to me and loves me eventhough i know i am not a perfect mother to him. He tells me he loves me every single day. He said he is my forever bestfriend. 🥰<br>And eventhough i cant get to have what i want in this world, his love is enough...that is all i ever wanted.
Mariana atancia
Be as unique

What an amazing speech,  I would like to listen to it everyday,  she is really special as I am. What I do is just to enjoy myself because I&#39;m unique and no one is like me.
Dam She is Hot! Muy Caliente! Y Bellisima!
I&#39;m  different because I have androgenetic alopecia and I deserve to be loved
I need someone to improve my English please.
Who tells you are special
She looks like somebody.

I’m special because no one cares about me😂

Very significant ideas, how humans should be.
Brasil eu gostei
I want to speak English like you. Can you speak English with me if yes that is my whatsapp number.03377622445
I am different because nobody looks like me,  maybe don&#39;t think like me.....i have all the things which i needed....even i have caring and loving parents....i have me with myself....i understand myself ,nobody knows me better than myself and many more.... People hurt me and i just forget them....😊<br>I am imperfect thats make me perfect...😇
I will try to comment with english, and i want to learn again and again
I am special and different because I am skinny. AND I don&#39;t care what other people say about me. I am doing my B.ED in English. So, you and I are different but we&#39;re special and that what makes us human being. &quot;LOVE, LIVE, LEARN &amp; EXPLORE&quot;
I’m special because my wife loves me and that’s all what I need in this life, nothing matter other than being with my wife. She is my best.
비록 3년전에 올라온것을 학교 과제때문에 보고 있지만..가장 의미있고 힘이 난다..나는 이 영상을 잊지 않을 것이다.<br><br>Although I am seeing this video that uptime is 3 years ago to do my school homework, I felt this video is meaningful and give me strength. I won&#39;t forget this video..I want to be like her❤<br><br>And I&#39;m from KOREA.. 한국인 없나요?
Great!
&quot;What makes you different, makes you beautiful&quot;  I have that quote tattooed on the shoulder. 💜💜💜🙌🏾🙌🏾
Thank you very much
What is make you special and unique is the same thing which make you a human.<br>Humanity is an important thing in our world today, because despite our differences we are still human being and we are still to treated like that.<br>So your ethic it make you special your act against injustice is make you special and helping others also is making you special.<br>morality also matter, you can not be special person without.<br>Also knowledge and practice are all make you special.<br>To be special it means that you want to go in road with two tracks, (take and give).
Aksen e apik
👍👍👍👍I like all time
Muchas gracias for your talk very motivating indeed 😊<br>From a Greek series I remembered this:<br>&quot;Επειδή είσαι διαφορετικός είσαι ίδιος με τους άλλους αφού κ αυτοί είναι διαφορετικοί&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because you are different, you are the same as others, as they are also different&quot;

This speech is pretty clear and impressive! Yeah,  everybody is exclusive...and we shouldn&#39;t forget about it🤗
It is good that we accept ourselves as we are and know that those differences that we have are what make us unique and special and that as Mariana says we must put ourselves in the shoes of others instead of making fun or simply making decisions.
She is absolutely superb...A wonderful and inspiring speech...Thank u
She is so beautiful, you can&#39;t ignore these❤️
What a beautiful woman 😍😍😍
I&#39;m a Japanese. I think it&#39;s a really great speech. This speech tells us If you can find your imperfections and look straight at them and if you can accept that you are, and that all others are the same, then you can re-recognize that you have the same humanity. If more people come to understand this kind of thinking, I think the future will be wider than it is now.
All r special
I think your career is one of the most beautiful, and just doing things different from what other people want to do, is what really makes you different
Thanks for the great points!
Your voice is too good
Is she Spanish?
Wow so inspiring
Amo tus palabras Mariana de principio asta donde quiera que tú las lleves
Awesome presentation! 👏👍✊🙋
Good girls👌
Her way of talking is 🔥🔥
U are beautiful
&quot;we are all different, we are all quirky and unique, and that makes us wonderfully human&quot; 🙂🙂🙂
الحجاب جميل وفطرة طبيعية ومش محتاج كل الكلام لنتقبلة او نتقبل المحجبات  بس المشكلة في نظرتكم انتم
I think that she is a person who wants to demonstrate that we can all achieve many things if we set ourselves. I like your thinking.
nice legs
Corona time. Anyone in 2020?
How impressive speech it is. I definitely watch this again when I lose myself

I like her phrase she told that everyone deserves to be a valued. <br>We all have a purposes,goals for ours life. <br>And nobody can’t stop us during ours way! If u are confident go ahead. <br>I always deny ordinary way to solve a problem. NO. Don’t forget that WE ALL UNIQUE. Nobody hasn’t  any idea what way will be right for u. If u are noble inside your soul and brave on your movements - U will fulfill everything crazy planes!
I cried when I heard about her sister
Every person who has learned about US knows that the history of US has been started with invasion, which means they themselves were already the alien. But now, how do they look at us? they really treat alien as if they are really the other, as she is talking now. This must be fixed as soon as possible because they already live with so many races in their country.
Strongly disliked this talk
Thank you so much
Có thuyết minh không ạ 😓
This is just awesome , it hit the core of my heart and recalled a lot of my past experience in USA
Love this Mariana!
What a true queen❤️Speaks through her heart.
Thank you for subtitle by vietnamese!
So confident..😊
사실 처음에는 영어 들으면서 자겠지 하고 켠 동영상인데 스킵 없이 끝까지 듣게 됐어요. 다름을 넘어서서 그 사람의 특별함을 보는 것이 쉽지 않고 나만의 특별함을 찾는 것 또한 힘들 테지만 전 계속 노력할 겁니다. 좋은 강의 정말 감사해요
You are not special
I will be honest Im here for the girl but in the end, I learn too
Anyone in 2020__ ??!
being normal is being special. Yours normal is not my normal. What is justice in your eyes and what&#39;s wrong from your perspective may be similar but not the same. I think it&#39;s normal to be a weeb, while others think that&#39;s weird. Some think it&#39;s normal to love someone with the same gender as them, and I don&#39;t. Whatever it is that is normal to you, I respect it. Because it&#39;s what make you different and special.
Amazing inspiration
How... just HOW did i know the first friend would be a Muslim?
i can feel my horizon widening literally while watching dis
Lol who
powerfull woman!!
Great speech ✌👍
This made me cry. Wow.
i am here among covid :((
When I was young, I suffered some pretty traumatic experiences. Once it was over and even during the process, everyone told me those experiences were meant to happen or that later they would make me a better person. I was forced to hang onto the belief that what I went through defines who I am and who I will always be. What makes me special is my ability to keep a level head during tragedies and see them through many angles. I will not deny that this is a result of my childhood. However, my childhood does not define me. If I could change what happened by going back in time, I most certainly would. But the fact is that it did happen and as of right now I cannot change that. What happened made me different in many ways. It made me unable to trust. It made me weary of new humans. It made my brain shift in insane and awful ways. It made my stomach permanently messed up. But it also gave me the ability to be levelheaded and thoughtful and I believe that is the most prominent characteristic I have today. This is what makes me special.
Wow 🤩
Wow I like her outfit. 😍<br>That’s how special I am I am admirable?. 😂😅🤣
how many are here not just for the topic<br>but her picture on the thumbnail
Everything makes me special
I just went listening to her without knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=1066">17:46</a> minutes have passed

I am Muslim,<br>Plz Accept us, We are not terrorists...

Imperfections make us special!!! Very impressive speech indeed!
Follow your own dream, not the American dream and life will be much more rewarding thats what makes me different. I&#39;ve learned how to follow my own dreams.
sidecar is the time 😍🇻🇳😍
Let be honest how many of you came here to see beauty 💞
What a great speech! I think everybody should watch it and start being more open for what is different than &quot;we&quot;
I&#39;m special because I have a dream I seek to reach.🙂
😍😍😍
I am special ,because God provides everything what I don&#39;t have

This talk is so powerful and touching! Imperfections makes us special.

that a great lecture !
I m special bcz I m short heightened and have a baby face...small hands and foot...weak body than others.😄😄
Amazing accent<br>Very nice
Anyone in lockdown?
Deadest audience I&#39;ve seen in a TED Talk yet.
We are all human.... So right. Celebrate the differences.
Started as &#39;Journalist&quot; ended as &quot;Activist&quot;
The hardest thing to face in this world is that some people question your capabilities and personality for reasons beyond your ability
One of the most effective stories on Talk, bravo
We cannot unite and defend humanity if there is no other side to threaten it
I’m special cause I’m an immigrant 💙
Dünyadaki bütün insanlar farklı olmak zorundadır.cunku yaratılışında vardır bu 7.800 milyon insanın beyni farklı çalışır. Ondan.kozmik gizli takip sisteme kapak olur bu....herhalde.
Dünyada an itibari ile 7.800 milyon dan fazla insan var ve hepsinin beyni farklı çalışır,ilgileri  becerileri ve yetenekleri farklıdır.her beyinde 100 milyar nöron farklı çalışır.noroloji.<br>Ayrıca şöyle bir sayı varmıdır matatikte mutlaka vardır biz ismini bilmiyoruzdur.her insanın beyni 100milyar noron×7.800milyar insan sonuç ortaya devasa korkunç bir matematik sayısı çıkar.bence herkes kendine göre bir özelliği ve yeteneği vardır.
Bu bilgi ve yeteneğe sahip olmak    öyle basit ve kolay değil,adem20 yıl harcadı bu özelliğe sahip olabilmek için.degisik ezoterik sırlı ve güçlü bir bakış açısı ve görebilme yeteneği.heryerde ve herkeste bulunmaz...
Special intelligent analiz yeteneği ve daha ötesi düşünce okuma(read mind),küresel siyonist emperyalizm kodları ve şifrelerini okuyup anlama ve yorumlama yeteneği.bu çok az bulunan bir yetenek ve beceri.her yerde olmaz...

People can easily set you into categories, but beneath the outer appearance, there is still a UNIQUE WHOLESOME YOU! Everyone has their own identity and own story: a homeless man isn&#39;t just a homeless man, a cripple isn&#39;t just a cripple and a famous actor isn&#39;t just the role you see on TV but they have their actual private lives that no one knows about... DIG DEEPER AND KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF!
I love this speech! Best lesson is when you are feeling that you are different from the rest, don&#39;t let how (the way) others see you define yourself! But proud of who you are and be true to yourself! And then once you appreciate what makes you unique (aka different), you will learn how to appreciate other people as well.
I watch the video 🤗
I love the last part with peace sign. She&#39;s great!

Don’t ever define normal, it’s the way who you are makes you special and separate you from the rest of the world. Think differently and Accept things , then you will see peace in you

I live in Brazil and am a singer, and everything you said is a reality. Unfortunately, some people look at others with an empirical gaze, judge them by what they see and do not try to know who they really are. The world is a school and every day we learn to live and get to know each other better.<br>Thank you for the constructive pelestra.

Beeing different always seems thinking differently
One of theeee best Ted Talks everrrr!!
That’s right!
Don&#39;t feel bad on me our confidence. our topic and goal make us different than other
Both content and delivery is awesome...!!! Love from Chhattisgarh,  India ❤

You make me feel special. I have watched tedtalk for a long time and it hit me that I finally find my way. Thank you so much for this motivational and inspirational masterpiece. We are different, we are unique, we are special. I am 15 by now, I will bear this in mind.
the ending of this talk provides us a really new beginning
So gorgeous 😍😍
How do you even understand anything special about you?
A lovely talk which makes us think about ourselves and others. Good topic to work in class!!.

The 2016 election was terrifying to those who were breaking the law not those who were law abiding and had been silenced for so long. <br>Whenever I hear people talk about illegal immigration and act like its not a big deal and everyone should just be cool with it, I immediately become wary of them cos they are not good citizens.
❤
Being non-religious makes it fairly straight forward to be a humanist. <br><br>There is no higher being in control with all the answers. Even if there is, it is doubtful that such a being cares about humans or has our well-being in mind.<br><br>Such a universe does not care about us. Any number of disasters could wipe out humanity. Disease, Climate Change, super volcanoes, meteors. At the scale of the cosmos we are nothing.<br><br>The only things that care about us are other human beings (and maybe dogs, cats and other domesticated pets), Nature and the Cosmos don&#39;t give a damn. Humans are what give life purpose and meaning. It is together that we have managed to develop civilizations with bountiful opportunities and comforts.
I come here because you&#39;re really beautiful 😍😍
What is the most Americans shoes like ?  Can the immigrants think in their shoes and the other way around again?  Would be intersting to discuss this.
is it only or it seems like she added extra words to get extra points

nothing
good to learn a better explanation for word DIFFERENT
this is such a strong message, thank you for being so brave and bringing up all these points, lets be humanists!
Now are 12 million ppl going to be different?!

She’s so beautiful. And this is one of the best speeches ever!!!🙏🏻❤️
you cant let the difference define you
&quot;let&#39;s celebrate those imperfections that make us special.&quot;
كلام شديد ...
What an important message.
The Individual is special because Individuality means one of a kind.  But we live among crowds that behave like Tribes.  Tribe vs. Individual has been a timeless battle.  Conformity, the battle call. No amount of education weans some from the curse of the herd.
How fluently speaking she is! i am really  surprised.
Some Simple and spantnous acts can make us very special and even extraordinary persons
Much love and respect from Algera
She is an influncer lady. I appreciated the way she narrated her experience and the identitical issues that she faced in USA and how she could fight all what hinders her of belonging to the new land she is loving in.
Minnesota is the most wonderful place to work and live in the United States. It&#39;s people, lakes and lands are pure love.
great talk speech
even i live in bahrain
Wow she is so gorgeous and very motivated
I love you
Her oral skill is such a special that it make&#39;s me how to find my special
I&#39;ve just read Miariana&#39;s book &quot;Perfectly You, Embracing the Power of Being Real&quot;. To be honest I cried a lot because as an immigrant I could feel the power in  every story she shared in her book as some she shared in this TED talk-all that struggle, fear, shame, and vulnerability that we as imigrants carry on our every day lives. I didn&#39;t plan to stay here forever, I just wanted to work for two years and save up enough money  to pay for my education back in my natal Honduras. But that time never comes and we end up staying because the money is never enough to fulfill our dreams and we have to take care of our families. I am more aware of my dreams and which strategies I need to use in order to achieve them. I didn&#39;t have a role model father nor a mother to guide me, I didn&#39;t have the tools as Mariana did so she could fulfill her dream, but I do have them now. I may feel too old, too short, not prepare enough or not smart enough and that I&#39;ve missed my opportunity, but I will do anything to change this chip I have in my mind thay does not allow me to grow, and to start thinking differently.  Go shase your dreams Adelisa, as this brilliant and brave Latin woman did and never looked back egain.

IAm African and I don&#39;t get why people see us as the other not everyone is your typical  african IAm just like you
To you Very nice beautiful
I&#39;m Vietnamese,I live in a happy family and study at a school where I can play with the best kind friends and learn with helpful teachers.All of people I know love me!That all makes me feel that I&#39;M SPECIAL !
Everyone is special since everyone is a the only one in the world.
it helps me got more knowledge after i listen to her. I love the way she speaks :)
Incredible
It&#39;s a so tearful speech story..God bless you..!!
I solute your speaking power..welldone madam...!!!
The summary of this speech is this verse from the Quran ... ( 13 )   O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted)
Spoiled!!!
Nobody is special. All of you are grown in the same culture like your parents, their thinking, their habits. You use same language, same idioms, wear same sh%t and drive same cr@p. What&#39;s unique in you, hey! WHAT you bring to humanity what others couldn&#39;t? Einstein - that was different. Mendeleev was different. You&#39;re NOT. You&#39;re crowd born to fill gaps on streets. Use to it.
Thank you
Ur sister is a real warrior ...✌️✌️
Even though I had just watched this, I realized that we are unique in our oen way and we should accept it, not reject it.
Don&#39;t get me wrong... but I am thinking to date her..😊
&quot;Shew as from the Middle East, so she could have probably taught me about belly dancing.&quot; Hahahahaha.

Preety speech
In every person there is something that distinguishes it, and a person has beautiful qualities. Let us live in peace, let each other leave faults, and think more beautifully about us.🇮🇶
I am special cause I have a deep, considerate mind. I really do have it. Many of my friends dont often recognize it, but thats ok My special talent is usually unnoticeable, because only a few have it. While earning this ability, I went through really hard, demanding experiences. Many of my peers who had no ideas of what they were doing, gave me big scars that i should bring forever. But i embraced them and think it is ok, because from that period i have learned how to comfort someone GENUINELY. I have earned a really amazing ability and i consider it my special point.
thanks
that&#39;s was amazing store
What a talk!!!! So constructive, so positive but specially so HUMAN! Love it🙂
The special people dont laugh from others . but focus to make a good picture to let them doin the same.
The Angelina&#39;s Mom was deported?
This is a graet motivation ❤❤❤
I want go on.
What?
its past 10 minutes and i&#39;m still figuring what makes anyone special
So Good.. Haven&#39;t heard something like this for a long time 👏👏👏
So amazing and inspiring. &lt;3
My god said in quran: We made you people and tribes to get to know each other.

America should be for Americans, I am Indian and India is for Indians, why should America be for everyone?? being different is not always good, for example: being a murderer doesn&#39;t make you special, it makes you a bad person😊
Thank you! I am a straight, white male who&#39;s watched and fought for the marginalized to be treated with the love and respect we all deserve. The saddest part about our current social structure is watching those who know what it&#39;s like to feel condemned for things beyond their control, treat others with the same condemnation for race and gender. This talk hits that perspective on the nose. Love others and do your best to understand them. Period.

Excellent Speech 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
You are throufully special but also you dad has a lot to do with,  Support is very important people that believe in you makes  all that happen, you will not be in this show it was for a good powerful member  that has  helped you to be here. To share us such your  intelligence and knowledge and experiences to us. I live in Australia with out not family been here for a long time and have study more than 4 professions and not one have given me and opportunity to work or even to speak some times.  I am like you different but with out the support that surround you.But dose it is not why I am different I will not be able to embrace what makes me different not in here, maybe in the U.S.A where you are, because different people is who make North America..I  think &quot; Likeability&quot; is a give not a difference and to  have it is what helps the most
My lecturer brought me here, and listen your speech. I like your speech and at the same time i learn how to speak english smoothly. Yes, everyone is different. Only us know how special we are! We have different life, experiences that made us today. For you, thanks for this beautiful speech. That speech can motivate people who not confident with themselves.
SApiosexual, that&#39;s why I am special
beautiful girl &lt;3
one day i will go to ted x
I am matter because i am the only one in this whole world.i didn&#39;t have luck about family.Not everyone have nice family but abused.&quot;Blood doesn&#39;t describe family but loyalty&quot; in my dictionary.<br>Most of abuse survivor have so many struggles to gain confidence,self esteem entire of their life,scars never goes away.<br>But i am still breathing.
i am  senegalease but i specilized in english , i like very well and i need many advices for my success
Excellent!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=653">10:53</a>  &quot;I may not agree with what you have to say, but I will fight to the death to defend your right to say it.&quot; <br>&quot;Without a dialogue, we will keep repeating the same mistakes because we will not learn anything new.&quot; <br>Wise words.
Everyone is special without listening to what they have been told to follow.  By not listening to ted talks but you are still living a good life you are uniquely different from the Ted speakers too.  By not travelling around but well you are still  having fun with your family, that simply mean  you are free from media pressures and your are definitely living confidently without forcing yourself to be someone else. <br><br>When you are living your way without yoga without superstitious, without makeup, without diet, free and easy, that make you special.
her steps makes ferfect
i really listen to her talk. i&#39;m studying english and it help me a lot
I love the way she speakes, thank&#39;s you make me want to listen to you all the time.
I am from the middle east  I went to USA and almost everyone treated me like a freak they either avoided me or was rude. <br>I am a woman in veil and a proud Muslim<br>I remember going to Disneyland <br>a man smiled at  me and told me I am glad u are here madam ,I really needed his words I smiled back and thanked his kindness<br>He was a man who saw my difference and accepted it<br> in a wonderful way<br>We all need to be like him <br>,thank you, amazing tedtalk
Oh ok so she used her Ted Talk moment to be anti-Trump.<br><br>Great.
i am the only normal one , rest of you are just weird :)
I&#39;m special because if I want to do anything I will do it inshallah. It&#39;s make me more special I think ....for that thanks my Allah
Thank you for the great speech! I watched this for improving English listening skill. I had thought it&#39;s going to be a long video for me, but I’ve felt it&#39;s too short because of her attractive speaking. Nice.
Love it
nice
I like her body, voice and how she&#39;s speak😍😁
Minority Muslims will make others life miserable ...
I love that she’s Latino yet open-minded on race. I believe it’s because she’s experienced racial discrimination first hand. I was disgusted with comments coming from Latino pageant fans when Miss Universe 2019 was crowned. I gave up on them. This speech however makes me realize not everyone is lost.
She nailed seeing unity in diversity through being human!
How can I move to hospitality industry to TED x talks
♥️
Good speaker but typical ted political spin. Little girl cries afraid of being deported? Dont be in a country illegally. Lmao.
Them resonant frequencies on the reflections need scooping out
Depois desse vídeo, eu espero sinceramente não ser mais a mesma pessoa.
I&#39;m special because i&#39;m different. I have my own way if thinking and i have a lot to show all the World.. i will work hard and let my success make noise .. i&#39;m unique
So touching
i am special because i can embrace all the different without making other people feel bad
اكو عرب ب طياره بس اني هنا

Why were u absent from 51. Envelope was empty.
Wow! This has been the most unhelpful time-wasting video I&#39;ve ever seen on YouTube! Good job Mariana, you broke the record.
@Mariana Atencio - Thanks for representing us Latinas and showing the world how strong, intelligent, and kind we are-no matter where we were born, we all have something to offer! 🙌🏽
White people will never accept anyone else as “equals”.  This is a true fact.  Research it. Actions speak louder than words, now look at their actions.  What country aren’t they in sponsoring terrorism?
I disliked the video, because so much drama in her words about her sister. Her sister is alive! What does she want more! It&#39;s so dishonest to people whom relatives died in the similar circumstances.
I am amazed with her speech !
The way she delivered her speech is splendid ! She knows how to grab the attention of the audience ❤️
I really need something like this today, thank you!!!
Wow she’s the most perfect human I see ! ~
luvvvv it
Was she crying during this session?🤔
My country also Bahrain❤️
Wonderfully human ❤️❤️❤️
What makes me special?<br><br><br><br><br><b>nothing</b>
Perfectly special woman
All the best
Excellent 👏👏👏
Hello.
My purpose is learning my listening skill!
GATEWAY  me not  need it cache go to ?

You are magnificent but those people doesn’t care.
Thank you my dear. We are in your shoes.
Thank you for reminding us that our differences are what make us stand out and can enable our success, not prevent it. When we learn to push past society’s views of us and create our own image, we can rise to our fullest potential and live full out.
Русские?
I am an human being.(is not it special)
türk yok mu ya
Wow
your fashion makes you special
Any contact no
What makes me special is I love to create, create things to make my life easier..  maybe one day I might create something special, that in turn? can make someone else&#39;s life easier? That would be so cool 👍 and rewarding.
Fatima teach you belly dancing? With that dress code?(i mean i get the point but she found the wrong source to make her argument valid)

Here education is about surviving, if you&#39;re in top colleges than you can survive with ease, or you will starve. I  <br>like gaining knowledge but not freakin learn it to survive.
I wan marry her.Mariana s special
I loved the definition of Jorge Ramos: &quot;Latinos breaking all barriers&quot;... Is that not blatant racism...???????????
&lt;
Good
God doesn&#39;t make us with spare parts, but <b>rare</b> parts.  &lt;3
This is the first time i watch this <br>Who is like me?
U seem special too
Whenever I am having self-doubt and feel very small, I always watch ted talks. Love it.
I think that it doesn&#39;t matter what makes you special, cause human and its soul is more than just you nationality, gender or anything. The soul says &quot;I am already cool, there is nothing that can make me feel myself better or worse , cause I am already cool

Being special is a special thing which differentiate us from others
Thanks Mariana for your inspiration👏👏
unbroken mind i admire
جميل جداً
Anyone In 2020?
What makes u special is time and space, because you only have to travel to another space and/or time to find someone who is your clone.  That is just statistics applied to the human genome.
Special is strange, and <br>&quot;nobody remembers your name....  When your strange&quot;, The Doors
Literally her way to expressing the past events that was painful but she had given an idea that no one is different , actually  everyone have rare quality which makes to everyone special...simply great thought....😇😇
Em dep lam
👌👌👌
“ Being different is an advantage “....wow, I never knew that.
Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️😘😘
Who click on  video after seeing her beautiful face
Thank you so much for sharing to all of you😍
Outstanding!
Awesome thinking
Happy new year 2020! <br>We all are special!
MONEY ?
Ya that&#39;s true...basic humanity is missing these days...time to become human first
You have kind geart
I really love TED they alway choose the good choise to advise me
I was always trying to fit in others or the values that others think is normal because I thought being special just made me destroyed<br>But I can say this is me from now
I feel bad for her roommate
Inspirational ✌🏼
so beautiful and stylish
What a fantastic thoughtful words imbued with emotions ! You have  logically said that everyone is different and unique and that makes us special.
Beautiful soul ❤️💕
Came here bc the subject and her face seemed intriguing.  Cannot stand her talking like a 13 year old to a target audience of elementary kids.
Ah That&#39;s Beautiful words
Really beauty with brain,<br>&amp; one thing I especially like to say that parents( rather your father is the person) makes you, what you are.<br>Salute to great father,
I love it.
I&#39;m Latino and I know what it feels like to be different in another country where you can&#39;t speak your own language - but it&#39;s like she says different doesn&#39;t make strong -y humanos
Is Mariana Atencio a relative of Carlos Ricardo Sanchez Atencio from Venezuela?
She``s most beautiful human being inside and outside  I can say tthat
Very interesting speech
I clicked on this cuz of her beautiful face. Makes me happy looking at it
How are you my friend
Praise to Allah; GOD bless you Mariana. Thank you for speaking the truth and thank you for touching the hearts of so many. Salam Alaykum (peace be with you).
It is totally different from it&#39;s title. Any way it&#39;s her good effort to present something.
What a pretty angel !! I can&#39;t focus on what she&#39;s talking about
I love how she ended her speech with a peace. :D
💚💚
Great speech. she is simply amazing and just simple person. Love you Mariana. keep doing  your good work
thank you so much
Good talk good looking
She so pretty I can’t constricted 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😂
I am special because I have high dreams and trying my best to make them happen.
Then, why live in the USA? Go to another country might be better
Awesome.
Very instrusting leacture
自分のユニークポイントは離さない。<br>成功や失敗は、他人の客観的評価だけで決まることはない。<br>ただ他人からの評価はとても早く変化し続ける。<br>忘れたくないのは、自分自信が「自分は違う」となんとなくわかっているから、自己評価がもっとスローに変わっていくことだ。

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=400">06:40</a>  Watch her Dance .
Her way of speaking is too nice she speaks very fluently what a melodious voice I just love it☺❤👍😘
Ur the best speaker i have seen👍👍👍 <br>Best of luck for the rest of ur life!!!
One of the best simple talks with clear objective.<br>Well done.
Way to assume someone can belly dance just because they&#39;re from the Middle East...
Beautiful voice wawww
This talk made me cry.<br>I have always had so many haters and I don&#39;t personally know most of them, I might not even know their names or who they are. And my friends would tell me to just ignore them and be myself because they probably just hate me because I&#39;m better. It made sense but I was skeptical too because I don&#39;t feel any better or different than anyone else.<br>So I googled: why do I have so many haters? Google aligned with what my friends said: you probably have something that they don&#39;t and they just have too much free time. Ok, so I googled again: how do I know if I&#39;m different? I was so surprised by the answers because the qualities listed were nothing special to me. I thought I&#39;d have to have some special talents or skills to be different, but Google says I just need to be a dreamer, positive, kind, empathetic, curious and a good listener. Right away, I sent my classmate (we never really talked) my lecture notes as requested because mine were neater; and I didn&#39;t because I was told not to be too nice to everyone as people would start taking advantage of me.<br>I guess what makes me different is that I&#39;m very true to myself and I embrace the person that I want to be. And having people doubting and judging me, including my parents, make me doubt myself more, just how Mariana felt at the summer camp. For some reason, I never stopped having that belief that I had, and I think it&#39;s because that desire to be the person that I wanted to be was so strong.<br>It really touched me at the end when Mariana said to embrace being special. It can be really hard but that is what makes us humans. Thank you so much for the talk.
I like the way you are.
ما في ترجمه
Loved it mariana, u rocked the stage and beat the brain, u said exactly the whole aspects of being different n the failure of perfection status in society,👌❤️
Muslims have great habits and practices that make them rare in front of any society so try to be respected for human race thats beautiful
100%love for her speech
Let nobody have a claim on the word &quot;normal&quot;.
Blessed !!
Oh ! Great !<br> this makes me to mind in that Allah chose me to be a Muslim.<br>And that difference is enough with me. <br>Thanks Allah for your guided.

tedx video helping my fluency&#39;s. i lern some hard vocabulary. and how to talk about a something
It&#39;s easy to see a colourful and positive world if you are part of the lucky ones among the unfortunate people. She has parents that supported and loved her, she has been able to study abroad and learn a job in favourable circumstances that many other would dream of, she is also a beautiful and gifted person. I personally think she is a fantastic human being, but not exactly the one to learn from due to the favourable circumstances shes has been through.
Wow Sart
I just played this video cuz she&#39;s gorgeous lol
I&#39;m only here because of her 🙊
She is h*t...
Guys plz hepl me for learn english. İ want firends(girl) speak with her everyday 🙏 i am from Azerbaijan
Where can I get the subtitles?
Nada demais na vida dessa mulher. O herói na vdd foi o pai que lhe deu a oportunidade de conhecer outro mundo. Obama é um entreguista. Trump está colocando as coisas no lugar.
Thanks , nice advice....

Please use subtitle...
MGTOW is the philosophy that changes lives, makes you a better person, you stop chasing women, and you only pursue your personal ralization, many men are waking up day after day, they lived like zombies believing a false reality where vanity and vain pleasures ruled them, when you discover this philosophy you take off the blindfold and live with a purpose that is worth it ..!  ♂♂♂♂♂♂♂
Excellent.
it is a wondeful speech that helps me many usefyl things.tks
Very good speech

Mariana you are so looking good perfectively host speech of the University of Nevada l really love God bless you all my time favorite amazing.
We already know what she said. It&#39;s easy to say that when you&#39;re gifted and privileged. She&#39;s different but different in a popular way. However, it&#39;s good that she is willing to do something about it.
What about Fatema. What happened to her
😍👏 you change people&#39;s perspective in life,,  I hope you lived a happy life knowing that you are good,,  awesome

The topic has nothing to do with the content. Thank you for wasting my time.
I love your speech I learned a lot of stuff abaut “special person”.🙏🏻👏🏻
What makes this speech special?  it&#39;s politically correct bla bla bla

She is beautiful , of course she is Venezuelan like me &lt;3
what makes me defferent has made me stand out and be successful.
Great
i hope you achieve all your dreams , you taught me a lot with a small speech but I&#39;m sure it changed something in me I feel like I&#39;ve seen the world differently by not even going anywhere except my own country you deserve the best
Let&#39;s be humanists!!!!
Discurso maravilhoso 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Thenkyou
Hi everyone
Thank you so much
You are genuine unlike all white people esp from uk etc , they just fake these talks on racism etc you can see thru them another white person trying to be famous by these talks on racism etc.  for the first time you sounded genuine and it came from heart on the point , amazing thanks ... wish the rest of white people from uk learn from you rather than just faking talk on racism etc just to get famous , they never will
Let&#39;s celebrate those imperfections that make us special 👍👍👍👍
My fingerprint doesn’t match with anyone else
I love myself
what a beautiful profile
I love my family <br>Specially my Mom
IT GUST AN AMAZING SPEECH THANKS A LOT
Please love our parent when They don&#39;t die
I am special because Jesus Christ died for me!
Congratulations u have crossed 10m views
Her jacket is very nice
But the point is, the most important point is those girls who covering their bodies, they do that with their want, its a &quot;choice&quot;, do you understand me.. its a choice and one of most beautiful choices, you should learn why they do that if you didnt. Its not imperfection, its a choice, its a beautiful choice.
My opinion: her speech give me confidence to move forward<br>Unpopular opinion : her speech clear but she is really beautiful than her fluency
good good good!!!!!!^^~~~~<br>thanks
Essa feriu o Ego dos Americanos ,  &quot;Somos todos diferentes , originais e únicos , e isso nos faz maravilhosamente humanos&quot;

I watched this speech for practicing English just for once but now I don&#39;t know how many times did I watched this.  This speech always gives me confidence and power.  Thanks Mariana and  you&#39;re so beautiful♡
Who wud miss a chance to get her dance along with u . I wud have the first to join her dance club......xd
it&#39;s an inspirational speech!
could anyone pls explain this phase &quot;work at belonging&quot;?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=1043">17:23</a>  &quot;Nobody has a claim on the word normal. We are all different.&quot;<br>hits me right in the core. So relatable. Realized this a very long time ago. I&#39;m so sick of those gender-biased social norms that are literally FILLING with people around me currently.
LOVE YOURSELF BEFORE ANYONE ELSE ..!!❤
when you have different, you will feel winner
I not have nothing in special i know this :)
what make me different is i,m not being influenced by you.
Kk
One of the best ted talks that I have heard  💜❤💓
&quot;What makes me different has made me stand out and be successful&quot;<br>Thank you Mariana Atencio.

LOVED HER.
What an amazing and powerful speech,thanks a lot for your beautiful words
Nhanh nhu Chóp nhi
I came here to listen things that i don&#39;t know. But i just heard a childhood story of a random young girl... Such a time waste... She talks non-sense.
el tema mundial deberia ser&quot; defendamos ala humanidad&quot;
She is beautiful
Cute young girl but I suspect she&#39;s smoking. She&#39;s speaking like an old woman with vary low voice.
Such master piece of woman!
uuuuf
🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍
beautifull story l like it so much
I thought this was the Fallout S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
She speaks English so well (0o0) even though it&#39;s not her mother tongue
You are perfect a girlllll💪♀️✌
I confess among all the TED programs I have watched so far this is the most special one and an influential one.
Her speech is great!<br>I’m a Asian so I have had feelings like her and then I thought I was a the other.<br>But now I am proud of being Japanese .
👌👌👌👌👌 ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️for evryone in this world💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💯🕺🇮🇳 IND
don&#39;t rely on others
wow.i love it
we don t need to be special we need to make our lifes and others better
So, if someone can’t walk, what should I say?”what is your personality?”,ofc I will say,”I feel sorry for your leg”,I don’t think she has the right logic
That&#39;s easy.If you have a clear brain,you are special
Love love love and power to all the humans like you around the world
平等对待每个人， 尊重其他民族的文化传统！
haha your story is absolutely amazing
Mariana is really special  from  the rest of the Latin. She is awesome!

Is incredible to me to see 5.1 dislikes and only 156k likes for this great material. Mariana congratulations, I really like what you said. We are still the others regardless how much better is getting. Saludos from another Venezuelan immigrant.

Love you Mariana, You are so beautiful and attractive. I can&#39;t stop myself from admitting that.
I special because Allah choose me to be a Muslim
Love her shirt!
Yes, everyone is special. So, please keep the law.
أنا مُميّزة لأنّي أمّ مسلمة أمازيغيّة ..
Thank you so much, Mariana. Your speach hits my heart. Thank you.
Why do you need to be special!
Every human being is very special
It is unlikely she will every walk again

MAGA 2020
she is so beautiful
She is so amazing, clever and beautiful, I wish I had that friend, honey😘
Majestic speech
I&#39;m I the only one thinks blue light on her hair is just beautiful?
Economics 101;  scarcity creates value. Everyone of us is so rare and unique that each work of fine art called &quot;life&quot; happens only once in time, space and dimension. The more of our uniqueness we lose...the less valuable we become.
I am agree with her because everyone of us is different. And it is our advantage.
Thanks...
De Venezuela para el mundo! 😘
That was awesome 👍
This is literally the best video I&#39;ve ever watch.
Se o Trump é o malvadão, o que você esta fazendo ai nos USA? por que você não volta pra Venezuela? afinal de contas la tem muita humanidade e solidariedade ne? hipocrita....
Imagine if all people like her
She got a beauty face
I have liked this because it is an inspiring speech.
we&#39;re have a commond, is being a human
&quot;We are all different. We are all quirky, and unique, and that is what makes us wonderfully human&quot;. -Mariana Atencio
Great speech!
I&#39;m special because I&#39;m honest with other people. I alway optimistic in all way
That&#39;s really great
Nothing...
like it ♡
Thanks you very very much <br>Because I am from to Vietnamese and need videos vietsud help me learning English <br>Sorry I learnt English not good
Speech smells aggression
I am so proud of this girl. She is from South America, my continent. She was and is warrior. She put herself on peoples shoes, as she often says. She is so amazing! ❤ I&#39;ll always support you. A brazilian is your fan! 🇧🇷
&quot;Degraded, dismissed and even reported to Facebook administration to have finally my page shut down!&quot; That&#39;s unfortunately what happened. My crime was just trying making friends to feel my self I have learned a new language. Unfortunately, There are many who are not able to accept &quot; the other&quot;. I am sorry to say there are many &quot;Fatmas!&quot;
Thank you very very much. Excellent. Thank you for your enlighted speech.
تحية احترام  لكِ من العراق.
DE VENEZUELAAAA PAL MUNDOOOO CHAMAAA!!!!!! Que divaaaaaa!! Nunca oigo TedTalks de mujeres, no se por que razon; pero me llamaste la atencion, y cuando lo primero que dijiste fue que habias nacido en Caracas, Venezuela; no lo podia creer; me dije a mi misma &quot;ella tenia que ser la primera mujer en TedTalks a la que tenias que oir!!! (disculpa que no coloque tildes en las palabras, pero por alguna extrana razon, mi laptop no me deja hacerlo aqui en Youtube). Eres muy arrecha!
How beautiful when she says another language...like the place she grew up...her accent🙌🙌
انا عاوزة الكلام يظهر ازاي ممكن تساعدوني
Sooooo beautiful thoughts✌✌👍👍
Humanity is before any religion color creed race or caste...wish everyone understands this once and for all.
اكو عرب بل طياره
Go on
Greattt
What a beautiful words <br>u r special not different.
ما شاء الله روعه ربنا يوفقك في حياتك يااختي
this is great. thank you!
It believe it  says : &quot;We are all different ! Dont love and respect anyone in spite of their differences but love them because of their differences&quot;
Atleast some are clickbaited<br>Like if u agree
Isn&#39;t these stuff like common knowledge? This talk acted more like a motivational video than anything else.
I want to meet Fatima!!
It was going ok until she started pumping her political agenda out.
The world is flat not the result of some random change. We are all specials. We are at the center the universe. Research eric dubay. You&#39;re welcome.
🤟
إنتي التميز زاتو
Simply superb speech ♥ she nailed it !!! Wonderful thought.. we all are quirky and unique and what makes us different is being human!! Lovely!!
I cried
She&#39;s the best. Loved her views,her accent, style. Just amazing ❤️
Muy bonita conferencia,tocas muchas partes de la vida real.
I’m special because I’m a woman . I’m special because I’m a fighter. I’m special because lm able to give and receive love. I’m special because I’m myself.
Bravo
Do you really need 17 minutes of talk to say &quot;we are all special on our ways and with our differences&quot;. No you certainly didn&#39;t.
Thank u very nice speech I must like
Just lovely. I&#39;m amazed
that s very nice for every one
Me too I am special. I can speak fluent English and fluent Arabic. I can cook well and dance well .. belly dance .. Saudi dance .. I wrote songs in English .. I write a lot .. I teach and I help those that need help... and I smile a smile that makes you remember your happiest times! It means I love people! <br>I think what makes us all special is our sweet differences.
unpopular opinion but she looks like Princess Kate Middleton
💜
Powerful!
my dream is to speak english like you.
I am special cause I have the greatest mom and her love,I am a Muslim and I get difficulties to get more confidence ...
asm
رائع الى ان تطرقت الى المثلية او مايسمى بالشواذ ! <br>هذا انتكاس للفطرة وأمر خطير ويهدد البشرية !<br>هذه الاشياء يجب الحذر منها وليس دعمها
Thank you so mach
After ten years I will come back to see this comment. Love from Vietnam
Wonderful
♥️♥️👏👏
U r beautiful
Beautiful beautiful talk. It moved me. Thank you.
everyone is special in their own way but  if he want to feel this.he has know his value first
Her father sent her to Minnesota at the age of seven. I searched for her real age, she was born in 1984 and it was the year 1991 when she was seven. There was not cell phones, Snapchat or Instagram introduced at that time. So, why she was complaining about these social media platforms, pretending she had to live without them?
Lovely video!
How to learn your language
The world is becoming selfish and that selfishness is stoping us from   putting us in others&#39; shoes which is the best way to bridge gaps and reduce xenophobic sentiments. Whereas, in the end we are all humans and once you get know more diverse people from very different religions/ countries you would be shocked how similar our values can be.
I want to do you!
I&#39;m unique because I have another view of the world.
Great speech.
U&#39;r right
What does &quot;we&#39;re all quirky&quot; mean???? please
, 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Mariana, congratulations on being what you wanted to be and making difference in peoples lives. Enjoyed your well articulated talk on this beautiful Sunday morning.
Her father had a little crush for USA, hum!
Communication i
Very good speech!!!
I am a family Dr in an area mostly gypsies live in. If you live in a mixed city like İstanbul and if you work in a such area nobody is different for you. If you get used to, nobody is different.
Oh please.... What makes you different also is that you have privilege. You come on here with your speech about seeing the other and &quot;understanding&quot; what it means to be the other. But you are technically what they call white passing. And clearly based on your childhood your family had enough money to put you where you are. <br><br><br>So yeah, great speech. But you cannot compare yourself to the struggle of &quot;the other&quot; because you are technically a privilege person born overseas.  Now if you had told me you started from scratch...
Awesome ❤️
Very handsome make me special
I&#39;ve never seen a speech twice so quickly !
Power of communication !  If you think about perfection, there she is !
Superb speech beauty with charisma  &amp; charm. 😍😊😍
As a muslim woman, I feel reeeally glad I stumbled upon this video. Her story about Fatima is so relatable. I was once stayed abroad as well and the experience of being accepted by my own classmates regardless of the religious attributes that I was wearing is something I am grateful of. It&#39;s not easy being a confident muslim woman in the western world, to be honest, but it makes my life easier as I can see clearly people who can accept me as who I am and who cannot within our first meetings without having too much drama.
just . all the respect and appreciation
Maybe nobody like me&quot;_&quot;
We all are different we all are unique and we are all human being..
This speech is wonderful
karaakasibeneswellaa
Thank you so much for being on the planet!  People who are bilingual have an advantage. The English language has a way of entraining the human mind.  If we teach our children a second language at an early age we will see the benefits through their eyes.  They will show us that they have a broader perspective of the world. It may be that way because they learned how to interpret their world in two different ways.   People who come from other cultures to the USA have so much information to share.
Amazing speech and ideology.Keep up the good work.
Latinoamerica representada en una charla y por una gran mujer ❤️🇦🇷🇧🇷🇨🇱🇨🇴🇨🇷🇨🇺🇪🇨🇬🇹🇭🇳🇻🇪❤️
I m special because god made me TEACHER ( GURU MENTOR )
&quot;By being it also means thinking in a different way&quot;❤️
what makes me special ? my ugliness, my 10% of will to live and my hatred towards every human
Great mentality ..
That was unique speech....love the way u talk.
please in indonesian language.
Firt, she is  looking like very beautiful!
Notice her changing accent from American sound to spanish sound
Yes, agreed. Everyone is unique and we should make full use of our advantages to become successful in life, study and work. :)
She&#39;s so pretty 😍
Focus on yourself and things/people that makes you feel good about yourself. Put your feelings in the 1st priority.
so beautiful
Amaaaaaazing speech I loved it !!!
what makes me different:<br>I don&#39;t know who I am.

I respected your guidance but tell one you, it&#39;s your experience belong me and other than your language is very smoothly and very pretty it&#39;s help me improve my english
Respect requires courage! 🖤
You are special because you are no better than anyone else, and no one else is better than you. Accept &quot;you&quot; in the wholeness with confidence, and that&#39;s the magic of being special.
I listening this video just because the speaker is pretty beautiful than other

Powerful and inspiring talk. Indeed, We are all human beings, that’s what really matters. However, we are all different and therefore, special. Thanks for sharing your experience Mariana!

傻左，你觉得你来美国就是获得一个space？经济、历史、资源、政治什么你都不考虑？ 毒瘤
There is a thing by talking on ted’s stage !  I lost my mom and father in 21 month working and through lots of difficulties! Divorced and other issues  and all those make me different
Best Ted Talk hands down!!!
Underestimating others is a very horrible mistake one can ever do.
Stand against wrongs and dare to talk what is right .. makes me special.
wow. An intriguing story
Great speech
She is such a beauty with a brain. Love the way she speaks👏
What makes me special? my nine inches
Wow that’s great .I’m born in
Who&#39;s repeated this speech more than one time ❤
👍
i just like your performance and dress
Que hermosa eres, excelente este Ted saludos desde ARGENTINA pero soy VENEZOLANO

Everyone is special! You can do better than before.

I’m special because I’m ready to change for a better me❤️
Mariana you was very lucky that your Daddy make your futue special,  Some children dont have that opportunity .
To feel different is not good for person, but how about different countries? whole country is different to US even if a lot of people support US way of life and not going to increase number of immigrants in US.
So inspiring! Thank you for your speech!
So good
keşke türkçe alt yazısıda olsaydı
Клас! Очень сильная речь!!! Когда я слушал ее, мне казалось, что она вот-вот заплачет. Но сколько мудрости и силы в этой молодой женщине!!! Да, мы часто и не задумываемся почему другие так отличаются от нас. Но и кто-то другой видит в нас отличия. Но, что в итоге победит - то, что нас разделяет, или то что объединяет, зависит именно от нас!
I like her communication skill
Your voice touched my heart! Thank you so much!
Estaba por compartir , hasta que dijiste en el minuto  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=765">12:45</a>  &quot;deben ser sancionados&quot;  y  cambié de idea. ¿Quién te crees que eres?
your talk is inspiring. Thanks dear
This talk made me want to be sent to summer camps.
There are stars in her eyes
that ideas sound good but I couldn&#39;t understand
Maybe you speak Arabic
This was a wonderful message.  From an young age I learned that everyone has a story.  Even the haters have a story behind their hate.  I learned this by having to repeat my story in defense of the color of my skin.  My story is not important right now, but I wanted to say how proud I am of you Mariana.  You could just keep this to your self but you choose to be brave and tell the story.  I think that if we all took time to understand each other there would be a lot less hate in the world.  Keep up the good work.
Gorgeous lady ❤️
im not special. i really want to be .
She is so gorgeous❤️!
I like this speaker 🤙
PLAYING FALLOUT 4 LOL.
I remember when I was 8 years old, seeing and meeting kids from France. They looked different, spoke different, had a different smell to them. That day was the beginning of appreciating what makes other special. That day began my path to my personal growth. Today, I love to meet people from all cultures, speak their language, sit and talk with them, eat their food. When i do this, i become them, I hear their struggles, their joy and they teach me that we do all come to this world in a different body, different color, but we all want the same thing, to dream and to achieve. What makes me different, is that I accept every human as a human; I AM a humanist. I celebrate me today and every day, because i am special, quirky and unique and a wonderful human being because I accept you as special, and wonderfully made.
Beautiful :)
She has a great speaking voice and style
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=287">4:47</a><br> that scared me lol
Great speech! Love this girl! She&#39;s so confident, powerful and motivated! I was almost crying listening about her sister...
The summary of her speech is you need to stop following the crowd in order to discover yourself and be different!
The problem with your premiss is that you wanted to embrace the American way, Fatima or any other Muslim by principal do no embrace, they assimilate. Assimilate other cultures. They’ve done it for centuries. It took Spain 700 years to kick them out. The white Americans are now becoming the OTHERS thanks to people like Fatima! We Latin Americans, like you, come from a common European ancestry, very similar to American. We look down and native Americans, the Native American that we in Latin America almost vanished from the face of the earth. How many people do we need to let in until this country brakes economically speaking. You sound true and compelling but I believe your selling your self politically! Because it is a political speech. You are beautiful and very European! You expect perfection from human? Be real! Life is not as simple as you think! Besides, it obvious that you come from a wealthy family. You think your speech will change the world? Forget the mold. You are arrogant, and yes... very human. I’m disappointed! It’s a brain wash! Vulnerable minds will listen but not smart people. And there are a lot of smart people in the world. Write another speech! One that is not so airy, so empty.
Beni neredeyse her dakikasi aglatan ve bir saniyesini bile kacirmamak icin pür dikkat dinledigim harika bir videoydu cok genis perdeden bakabilsek ve basarili olabilsek kendimizi bulabildigimiz alanlarda en onemlisi empati kurarak baska insanlara saygili olarak hayatimizi sekillendirmek umarim iyi insanlarin iyi hayatlari olur
Pathos always works above Logic and Beauty finds her way to make you special........no matter, what profession do you have
es una comunidad donde conviven
Proud of a Venezuelan women, she&#39;s leaving the name of our country higher.... loved her
Deeply cute
h god, I loved it. Congratulation for your history and discuss. i could felt truth in your words
💛💛💛💛
This is one of the Ted Talks I&#39;ve ever seen.
I love the way she speaks, so fantastic and brilliant. Get it up dear.
Attractive people sound intelligent too...its our brain that tricks us, just a fact
Look inside yourself, encourage your positive ambitions and your will to succeed. Now go and create the circumstances you want. Start taking decisions and start living.
She is very lively <br>I really love her speech💕
好正
Sin querer llegué a tu charla, y si bien la idea era sólo practicar mi inglés, me fui metiendo en tu historia y la empecé hacer mía. Una resume de lo que muchas veces la vida nos obliga a entender: Que seamos conscientes de lo qué nos hace ser especiales. Sin embargo, hasta que no las reconocemos (o aceptamos), no podremos avanzar en la meta de cumplir nuestros sueños.. Saludos desde el fin del mudo...
l appreciate this speech a lot, it is extremely impressive !
Wow ! Her voice is so high which makes you listen to it again and again and many more times . Also she&#39;s attractive in her dress without regarding her self talk , it was very amazing and a special one 💖💖
Ain&#39;t nothing special about me. You&#39;ve got winners and losers in this world and I&#39;m in the latter group unfortunately.
I always complaint about myself but now I can say<br>&quot;I am special&quot;
I have always known that l am a special person. Great one dear 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️🌹🌹
Wonderful😍
That&#39;s not truth. At the time you where born I already was leaving in FLA, and there were many Latin people spread everywhere.

So one has to be special to live on planet earth? Hmm
The difference is not weakness but being different means being special . That is why God created different People. Glory be to God.

Amazing talk.
OMG I AM ALSO FROM VENEZUELA!! NO MAMES, MARIK QUÉ ARRECHO HERMANOOOOOOOOO
Im special because i am fierce. I always get back up no matter how many times I fall.
😭😭💗 amazing.
&#39;nobody has a claim on the world &quot;normal&quot; &#39; it is a worth speech
TEDx Talks is very good for us
If you&#39;re from Argentine, you may think that she is Kircherist... hahahah
I&#39;m special because  I&#39;m the ugliest being that has ever lived
We need more women in power to help bridge gaps between the &quot;others&quot;.  Too many men have been cultured to be consumed with competition and trying to gain power over others.  Women need to run things until men evolve.
Yeah no one knows what the future hope..none is normal ...everyone is normal being different,..difference is  perennially special..that makes you unique. I&#39;m unique. Thanks for this  revolutionary gaze changing insight !!
why am i crying
get countries to recognise eachother differences in and there strengths for a global community .
I have not any special talent
you&#39;re so honest
Bravo ✌
Especial
For the first time I&#39;m grateful for IELTS
Playing with the language...long narrative but she can cut it short and come to the point.Making people understand to the point is more impt.
Her accent and hot curves totally distracted me!
Very nic and attractive
that is very attractive speech
The thing that makes you different cause your view of your life. Be aware of your difference and special spot, you can live trully to be human
2019??
I love to meet people who are different no matter what aspect of life, I always show respect and understand the differences. I think that makes me being human.<br>This talk is something really worth spreading, every good things begin only when we become humanized.
Love much of your speech
Mashallah
I&#39;m special because I love myself😘
Great and wonderful speach, competent and beautiful jornalist.

&#39;&#39;The others&#39;&#39; who are these others who label others with &#39;&#39;the others&#39;&#39;  probably accepting the facts behind &#39;&#39;the others&#39;&#39;  being thankful in every situation is a powerful tool to go the other side of &#39;&#39;the other&#39;&#39; and again probably it will make others &#39;&#39;the other&#39;&#39; for you. <br>A very powerful and aggressive talk by Mariana Atencio. Love to see any women in the world talk so confidently.
She is greatest

She is beautiful ..Love you 👍

The most amazing and inspiring TED talk!!
لو لا الاختلاف ماكان للحياة طعم.
Each and every one is fearfully and wonderfully made by God for a perfect reason in our imperfect beings. Trust Jesus, Follow Jesus, CHOOSE Jesus CHOOSE LIFE.
But what makes you special ?
I&#39;m listen to her in a loop for an one hour without feeling boring or freaking out. Good job, Mariana!!!
被她的剪刀手惊呆了！！！The V-sign!!!!!
Wow, what a terrific Dad she has!
You tell a story in a powerful way.
Amazing speech ✌
Everyone is special in the world,our different experiences make us different!
&quot;what makes me different has made me stand out and be successful&quot;
wtf come on,<br>she said that her arabian friend would teach her the dance?!$()$)_)$)$)#) this is kinda stereotyping her 😧
i didnt learnt anything... a rich Venezuelan settles in US and ..
She is so kind, unstanding and encouraging. The talk did cure me a bit.
Ridiculous logic
The only thing we all have common is being human ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I&#39;m an asian girl that lives in Russia. When i was 5y.o we moved to a town, where everyone talked russian. I didn&#39;t. I was &quot;different&quot; It was hard to fit their environment for a village girl. But i learned to speak russian, and english. But my self esteem hasn&#39;t changed. I&#39;m still non-confident. And i don&#39;t know who i wanna be, how to make money, i haven&#39;t find the place where i belong. I dream to move to english speaking country. But i don&#39;t have money, i haven&#39;t find myself. I&#39;m stuck here in boondocks. I feel like i don&#39;t deserve the better life.
Grazie Mariana! La speranza è negli esseri umani come te
Thank you so much for giving this message to us. I recognized that there are a tons of people who have various difficult living conditions but they still talent, they still think like a optimistic person, they live in a happiest way with their family. I thought i should appreciate myself more and more. Furthermore, i will totally believe that myself can do fascinating things in the future for my country or the world. By the way, love you!
Truth
so inspirational
I can&#39;t say much about life and i don&#39;t have plans for the future i think i can easily reach but i can say this motivated me
amazing 💞☺
I nearly cried when she talked about her sister and I&#39;m so glad that she recovered from her accident❤️ You are absolutely a powerful person.

Además de guapa eres muy observadora, con todo, no ha sido suficiente para elucidar qué hace especial a una persona, sólo puedes ver en qué es diferente; eso lo ve todo mundo.
Although she kept emphasizing the difference in humans, in my opinion, humans are more similar than you might think of.
1 word (Amazed )
I dont know what special about me. How can i know that?
Beautiful
I thought I was normal. But there&#39;s something different that makes me special, I can be a good listener. Is that a different thing?
A persuasive speech
i like
AMEIII.Acho que o que me torna especial é meu gosto por músicas antigas e filmes, sempre dançando de um jeito estranho
Inspiring speech
superb speech and high confidence.when time finish i didn&#39;t know.
Beautiful girl
This is really impressive

One of the most beautiful Ted speaker!
completely different completely motivational speech and completely sensible talk... I love it
Just a question that always confuse me, does Trump against all immigrants or just illegal immigrants?
Hello everyone! My name is Ban Tran and I&#39;m from Vietnam. I  want to find a partner who can practice English with me everyday! if you have the same purpose, please contact me by skype: bantran09011996 or whatsapp: +84979455095. I&#39;m looking forward to see you. Thanks so much!
Tedx helping me for improving my English also giving me knowledge about so many things
I wanted some American people to talk to me so I could learn English.
&quot;Failing to see anything good on the other side makes a dialogue impossible. Without a dialogue, we will keep repeating the same mistakes because we will not learn anything new.&quot; That&#39;s it exactly. When we hide or denigrate others on social media, when we believe that one group has a monopoly on compassion or God or women or prosperity or progress or equality, when we subscribe to an us or them mentality, we suppress the dialogue that will bring us forward to a wider view of the world.
No snapchat no instagram, what is she talking about? There was no instagram och snapchat thoses days you pretty!!! Maybe no one in the crowd noticed while they were insist whit her speaking skills. <br>Or am l wrong about it?
powerful
She s life story is very amazing and different
heart involved.
Well the thinking of her and as she says everyone is different it&#39;s true
What a wonderful father
💜
Wonderful woman!
This girls good People

U r voice is very clearly neatly performance and am u r fan
love this speech. &#39;Different is what makes you special, and be proud&#39;
I m straightforward not fake
I really appreciate her , applause for her
Awesome!
parler de ... café sans grand ... sujet. Chaque jour je suis plus spécial ..
i love the message and it&#39;s very good idea, but my believe is to cut down the speech up to 3 minutes. because the main idea was given in few seconds, no need too much details that makes the main idea distructed by non-value adding details.
i love Mariana so look great.
I want be can language english
She is beatiful
Thank you for stating this so well, let us all work at defending the human race, that is the only way to success and love which is why we are here, lets stop the differences because we are here to learn and grow.

One of the most powerful Ted Talks I&#39;ve heard, thank you for sharing.
this video is really meaningful for me! I&#39;m a Vietnamese girl, I want to learn more about our world, I want to learn more about our life, I want to learn more languages, cultures,... but in my hometown, they just think that &quot;why do girls learn too much?&quot; that speech make me really stressful :( but, I&#39;ll try my best, I&#39;ll be diffirent, I&#39;ll do what I want. thank you for your talk, Mariana &lt;3
one of the best speeches yet
She is very attractive ..!

Que lindo. I loved it
absolutly this vidio so much  viewer because the girl so beautifull
Ladies from Venezuela are awesome!!!
Being brave and always try the best to believe, even the first step
wonderful
when you can&#39;t think of anything that makes you special.
It is hard to be different in any community or school where rules are important. Some rules are meant to protect you but some rules will make you feel different than the rest. I think until we all clarify what it means to be in community or school. the fear of being different will always be there. It is not easy as we think but again, I think the more open our mind is and the more we focus on each others happiness and less on right or wrong. The less this problem is likely to happen between misfits and popular,
her story&#39;s really can growth up  my spirit to  more care about the others
hi
cant see the logic...so she is for the whole world flooding into the states? hw is dat sustainable?
I think i am special in nothing
good
ko ga ada translate nya -_-
Beautiful mind beautiful thinking .
Thank you so much!! That&#39;s a very necessary talk!
Thank you  Mariana  for your  empowering  motivational , inspiring, words  i adore you!!!! your   beauty  inside and out is such a blessing  thank you xoxoxoxox
I don&#39;t know exactly why, but every time I see the news about venezuela, her face comes up.
that&#39;s the best spech i heard this year thank you so much ,RESPECT.
I just wanna say, it really helps me to cope with the situation I face right now. Thank you so so much.
I have had chronic IBS-D, screwed up metabolism for so many years of my life...still did my undergrad from one of the top school of engg. (in India), kept going like a warrior and got an MBA degree in USA from a top school...With just my sheer will-power, faith only in myself (not and anti-theist but still am against GODism), and a sense of belonging to a larger goal in my life overpowered my IBS attack episodes while I was in MBA (without any allopathic meds); though during the stressful years of 2009 while I was graduating, started having severe back-pains and then had an episode of arrhythmia, and later some episodes of IBS . But my determination and single-minded approach towards life to live like a warrior helped me transcend all the pains. Doctors have no idea how I did what I did...But I have started to understand a while ago (now i am 38) that life is amazing, that all this difference, competition, hatred, jealousy  is meaningless, success is TOTALLY subjective. All that matters is to LIVE like a warrior and die like one...giving your best to humanity - try to be part of the solution and NOT become another problem. Love and compassion are great weapons against the insanity this world is moving towards. Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism (religious aspect) and Yoga (practice aspect) can surely show us the path and can help all of us to a certain extent, but then each of us has to traverse our own path to become a REAL HUMAN. May real strenght, compassion, and peace be with all.
she is attractive , and she knows how to attract audience while speaking
Some people are just happily predefined by their cultural dogma, and one wishes it belongs to the mainstream. Stepping out and trying to change things mean a great deal of courage. Sadly, not that many who are holding comfortable seats are willing to do in this day and age.
Again
Welcome dear I don&#39;t know ur name ....anyway welcome dear
this speech makes me love myself more thank you💞
too much beautiful..<br>I&#39;m impressed by her attractive behaviour..
Good speech
Wow she is a Discerned person ... love the way she thinks and talks 👍👌
International summer camps , can’t relate
✌✌
I celebrate and applaud this brave lady. What an efficient, useful, and powerful talk.I watched very compatible talk and movements. Thank you Mariana.
Amazing words,  we are unique!
Bravo, Mariana!!
Wow!  Thank you so much for a great speech!  As an immigration,  I totally understand what you and your sister said and how you felt! I realized one thing that we are unable to change what other people think abt us, unless they want! The only thing we can do is that &quot;change ourselves&quot; and &quot;prove&quot; that we deserve to be respected despite the differences! It reminds me of what Michelle Obama said&quot;when they go low, we go high&quot;
كلكم لآدم وآدم من تراب
Thanks for the talk especially when I’m getting lost in finding who I am :)
difference means isolation
My name is also Mariana
لو كان مترجم....

Mariana the fake news priestess reporter apparently thinks being on tv makes her special enough to deny a handicapped veteran his parking spot so that he could vote.
Orcid Shaon
Those words are pretty . But not every person is like you think. We can&#39;t be the one because of some religious rules.
AT her childhood. there exists snap chat and Instagram.. :D

I loved your accent Mariana, i am from Brazil..
In my life I want to be like one day I hope that becomes soon
what&#39;s the point of this Ted Talk anyway? A privileged girl takes about integration issues while her own country is burning. Honestly I stopped listening after just 5 minutes.
This is great !
I just love her his and talk and must say she is  very beautiful
What a beauty woman,  Venezuela of course
thans mariana  is very intesting
its really incredible speech
اسلوبها و كلامها حلو يخليك تريد تضل تسمع بدون ملل اما عن فكرتها فهذا الشي الي كل العالم يتمناه و اولهم العرب
Ur family motivat &amp;made u
i think she might&#39;ve been a rabid fan of the former Obama president .
owe what makes me special is it schizoaffective bipolar disorder is it alcoholism is it scoring 200 on IQ TEST many times in a row yes i&#39;m pale white man i face stigma where ever i go i know this President dont give a  care about people yes my brethren of all shades of skin yes schizophrenia people pigeon hole you owe your insane thats right i&#39;m insane a lunatic to be believe a man who preached it all we say to America be true to what ya said on paper 17 mental hospitals yes Christians want nothing to do with a man like me why I don&#39;t know
Love your story. I‘m so sorry for Christians. Where is your humanity?
We are all immigrants. We are all guests on this earth
Mostly pretty decent ideas, but still missing the point.  Instead of trying to get &quot;minorities&quot; and different &quot;groups&quot; to learn how to understand each other, back up several steps.  The way we choose to &quot;group&quot; people is mostly arbitrary.  Skin color has virtually no correlation with potential as a human, for example.  We pretend skin color is super important, that people with the same skin color think the same way.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  You can find near 100% ideological alignment between someone with the lightest skin and someone with the darkest sometimes.  Other times, you can find two identically-toned humans on completely opposite ends of the political/ideological spectrum.  If your solution to racial tension or any other social problem starts with the idea that skin color (or any other arbitrary difference) makes people think the same way, you&#39;ve already royally screwed up, and everything you propose based on that faulty foundation will ultimately fail.  That&#39;s why racism still exists.  No one has addressed the actual issues.  That we&#39;re not that different.  That drawing thick lines and forcing people into arbitrary groups is just perpetuating the &quot;us vs them&quot; that we pretend we&#39;re trying to get away from.
Anybody feel exhausted heard everytime when she takes a breath from her mouth?
A proud to Venezuelan people, good message and very good English despite isn&#39;t her first language and despite her short age, congratulations!!!

A1
I’m special because I love myself and that’s all that matters
I am a woman and I love to build and work with my hands.  I have an eating disability.  I suffer from depression and anxiety.  This is where my compassion comes from.  I felt rejected by my father as a child, and wanting to be accepted and proving my worth is what pushed me to learn to build and sing and cook and clean exceptionally well.  This video inspired me to share this.!
you are amazing and right!
Thật tuyệt vời.
wow
nice speech!
This was the most beautiful speech I recently heard...it is so beautiful to be human..
she is so dammmm cute
Who listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=700">11:40</a> today :D
Your speech and your every presentation is amazing, sensational and pretty good. Keep up my dear Mariana.
Love it xx
Powerful speech. Her beauty tremendously adds to the effect!  Powerful though, her speech would not have made such an effect had she been an  Muslim woman with a headscarf talking on the same theme . It seems that we  humans, will never overcome our biases completely.
special is just not a word its a feeling that you own
انسانة واثقة من نفسها جدا
I just take a huge love to my own life, you can inspire people who think he is different then give a hope to rise up the smile
I just realized that the thumbs down counter on people&#39;s comments is not working. Anyway this was a great speech.
She s really pretty
Thanks a lot for these great ideas
good speech
Good sis
I am a child of God, that&#39;s what makes me special.
اسفه يا ماريانا ما انتبهت  لكلامك من كثر ما انتي جميلة

Thank you for this performance, we need more videos , not just for Africans or south americans , but for all humanity  ... A big love From Morocco
Plz...give me bangoli language 😭
Wow...she is so special
Typical marxism. Saying some sad stories to make people cry and using it as an argument in discussions on something absolutely different. And of course - the main thing in our times - comparing illegal imigrants with legal imigrants that built strong America - what a hypocrisy!!!
Mariana God bless u sweetheart sorry for waiting love u take care.....R G G
Amazzinggg God bless u dear sista😘❤
I jumped when she said &quot;Caracas&quot; I live there!
the Angelina story 😭😭
I’m different too ✌🏻, thank you so much and i liket this words and i like you ♥️♥️🎶
For those who thinks she does not make any points by bringing her own experience, play the video back to when she also said people from different nationality think differently, when you feel her experience doesn&#39;t mean anything, please don&#39;t just say so. because her story might be inspiring for those who were being defined as different in the United States.
Greaaaaaaaaat 😍😍<br>I like it
👍👌👏👏👏
Maravilhosa!
I love this &quot;U can&#39;t let those differences define U&quot;<br><br>Thank you :)
Çocuklara okulda ders olarak izletilmesi gerek
i went through comment and nobody gave credit to her Dad! that insane futuristic optimistic person exactly knew how to build life for his children! and see what he created, A masterpiece who inspired millions!
great speech
You are hot, any chance having a cup of coffee with you?
Kalıplar insanları ötekileştiriyor. İnsanlar kendilerinden farklı şeyleri kabul etmek istemiyor. Ama bu farklılıklar içerisinde bizi birleştiren en önemli şey hepimiz İNSAN&#39;ız.

Inspiring :)
Ure so beautiful
Amazing speech!!!
Nice english👍👍👍
Well,well, a award-winning journalist correspondent for the MSNBC who didn&#39;t report for a year on the atrocities  the US/ Saudi&#39;s are committing in Yemen, but in the same period reported on a playmate hundreds of times....you should be proud.....
Thank you so much, Mariana 😊😊😊
Very well said
I love the way her voice sound
Thanks a lot

We (the others ) will be always solid powerful and do all what it takes to improve and express our selves <br>Love your speech 😍😍😍
Perfect program and wonderful episode!Thanks!
Perfect❤️
As I was in stuck with my Deutsch lessons because I could hardly hear conversations in Deutsch clearly so I went unintentionally to some speeches in 2 languages, that&#39;s how I ended up in here. Her speech inspires me with brave and emotions, if it was 1 months ago I need an Engsub to every TED video but today I can hear it clearly and like some of you, almost crying. Really wonderful speech.
❤❤❤❤
A dad with a lot of money
&quot;The Other&quot;  Sorry, lady, we are one human family, there are no &#39;kinds&#39; of people.
Applauding should have been higher . Seems very honest and the way you connected the ideas was brilliant.<br>Thanks alot
Thank you for your speech it is nice.l cried.
I think I&#39;m the youngest viewer am 14 years old<br>but nice lecture
Where is she from?
She is really a great speaker. It&#39;s hard to believe that English is not her mother tongue.. she is having good control on her thoughts and words..
Nicely
Congratulations Mariana. You´re amazing.  My best regards from BRZ. Santos City.
En resumen:<br>+Ser direrente implica que la gente tenga curiosidad quien eres, no ser aceptada y ser criticda a primera vista. Cuando uno dice q esa persona es diferente (el otro) la deshumaniza e incluso uno piensa q es la mayor causa de todos los problemas. <br><br>+Ser diferente es una ventaja porque destacas y es lo que te da éxito.
An excellent speech. The whole world need it .
? I don&#39;t know the thing which make me different so what should i do
Oh yes, Barack Obama is so amazing and tolerant for immigrant families, and it&#39;s ok that that he intefered Syria and destroyed homes of thousands of citizens.
Niye Türk yok lan
This is so inspiring
I have a lot of flaws. I got a scholarship for study master in Thailand this august. and I doubt some things. like, whether I can attend the lecture there or if my english is enough, if others will understand what i am talking about. and it&#39;s quite stressful :(
沒有中文字幕
I&#39;m so much different like you!  But don&#39;t leave still.  I like you Speech. Mariana Atencio Thanks friend me
كيف الواحد يتكلم بهذي طلاقه والسلاسه في تسلسل الاحداث
Hey greetings  everyone , I’m learning English jajaj I hope meeting someone who want to share knowledge
Nobody would believe that she is not native English speaker!!!!
Bu muhteşemdi işte.
شكرا جزيلا , merci beaucoup , thank you very much , arigato
It&#39;s beautifull speech Mariana..
CONGRATULATIONS !!!
This applies to non-human animals too
Be different :)
She is so cute
awesome
Gözlerim doldu.Çok içten bir konuşmaydı.
كل انسان لديه حلم و لنا الحق في تحقيقها<br> كل منا مميز بطريقته الخاصة ........
This speech was amazingly written and spoken. However, it does bring up something I was thinking about before. How does this applies to murders, rapists, and etc.? I know there are accidents, self-defense, etc, but for me, it&#39;s hard to get pass their labels of &quot;murder&quot; and see them as human... especially those done in cold blood.
Hmm, I see a future bright in politics. <b>You GO, Madam Governor!</b>
I REALLY like it . The moment you accept other&#39;s differences, you reach the halfway point of being different and especial
halsey?
I think this has a wrong title. It should have been called celebrating our differences or something like that.
Amaizing
You&#39; re so sweat
Yawn😵😪
What kind of people would thumbs down this inspiring speech?
&quot;I am different... Belonging takes work &quot;
great
My favorite speech...
one  of the best  talk  i have ever  heard
Why do i feel like it didn&#39;t end well for Fatima? poor thing! should&#39;ve been more into belly dancing, maybe then she would&#39;ve gotten along with Mariana. What a silly world we live in!
ف حد عربي هنا 💔😅

👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
She has many wonderful experiences! She teachs me a lot, yes, we are different and it makes us to a special in our life
What if I’m not different just rude and nice at the same time
Excelente,
We are ALL a part of the same mind. That&#39;s precisely what authoritarians fear most!! That&#39;s for your sister&#39;s recovery!! Love/peace to you and your dear sister.
Amazing speech!
I want to learn English. can you help me?
I believe that every single person has a powerful energy so I have to respect every person
after everything th eonly thing matters is &#39;&#39;everyone is special&#39;&#39; in some way or the other
Good shape!
Peace out!

Is it amrican accent

wow best talk show
Maravilhoso.
I speak two languages, Japanese and English. I definitely feel I think differently depends on which language I use.
Her beauty and her character left me speechless.. I&#39;m going to look for a bride in Venezuela!
Thank you for sharing!
Amazing and charismatic woman. I nearly cried while listening to her.
Süper 😢 bizde Almanya da farkliyiz. KIZIM birgün bana neden Alman degiliz demisti... 5 yasindaki KIZIM ötekilestirildigini hissetmisti. Üzücü tabi.
Great. Pleased to meet people. You are welcome to visit Vietnam ..
Insan bi türkçe alt yazı koyardı da anlardık başlığa türkçe yazı eklemek kolay tabi
Que palestra incrível ❤
she&#39;s so well spoken
I am big fan of you
You took the good decision<br>About your carrier
Being different is human. It&#39;s thanks to our differences that we create the world!
She&#39;s empathetic, she&#39;s wise she has a beautiful soul. She is much better than the average (aka being special).
So astounding 👍👍👍
We must love each other because we are same as we are different...  I&#39;m Turkish and the peoples are looking me to like &quot;Ah a Turkish people I hate them.&quot; but I can&#39;t understand. Yeah,I can&#39;t even sure if I&#39;m talking English true. (So if I have mistakes please tell this. I tried to tell racism isn&#39;t a good thing.)
Great talk really opening!
Love your idea.

الحاصول أن الحاجة الي تخليك مختلف عن الآخرين هي الي تخليك تكون ناجح
هذ البنية صحفية من فنزويلا، تقول بأنها كانت صغيرة وجاء عنها بيها وقالها راح نبعثلك لمدينة ميكي ماوس ولكن غلط الراجل وبعثها لبلاصة أخرى، المهم راحت في مخيم صيفي عالمي وتلاقات ثمة مع لدزامريكان واستهزاو بيها قالتلها واحدة : تعرفي واشنو هوا الهمبورغر؟ تروحي تقري فوق الحمار؟<br>راحت الايام ورجعت الايام وهي في حد ذاتها راحت تقرا صحافة تلااقات مع مسملة بالخمار ولكن الصحفية تاعنا ما عجبهاش الحال انها مع مسلمة لانها راح تضيق عليها الحرية  تاعها مثلا الصحفية هاذي حابة تدير صاحبها وتعيش حياتها <br>منبعد الصحفية ضيقوا على لاصحافة في فنزويلا وقفلوا شوية قنوات<br>جا عندها بيها وقالها لازم تخرجي من هنا هاذي مراهيش دولة تاع صحافة <br>راحت تغطي انتخابات باراك اوباما رئيس الماريكان<br>ومنبعد بدات تفتني علينا كيفاش تكون متميزوتنصح فينا أن التميز يعتبر شيء خاص وميزة تنافسية للعبد مش حاجة تلزمنا نحشمو بيها
iam ready to listening to her every day..
Нихуевая такая телка)
يحلوها وياحلو كلامها
Dream woman! Great speech!
Im special because i am the only one who is not special... wait.
Hermosa e inteligente Venezolana !
If you want to do something diffrent, take a decision as early as possible as life will not wait for you.
She&#39;s pretty
She didn&#39;t finish about Fatima
You’ve been so inspiring, your story is so reletable and you’re an awesome human being
ohh its amazing we are from caracas you are a great example for all
If you are different from the others and want to be accepted into the team, you should be smarter, more fun, sociable. You must be like the kind of people you want to be friends with. Such rules exist in the world. We are not ready to accept other people if they are different from us. We blame them for our problems. They disturb us. People do not see a successful lawyer or a merry fellow in a person who moves in a wheelchair. We must remember that they are also people with dreams, ideas and needs. We must learn to accept them.
Her voice ...just unbelievable
You are a journalist? Incorrect. You are a person who works as a Journalist. You are a smoker? really? Can i put bacon in you to smoke? I am... &lt;- very powerful statement, stop abusing it.
ボルテールって誰かと思ったらヴォルテールね
<b>أتمنى تعطونا روابط المقاطع التي تتحدث الإنجليزية ببطء</b>  حتى نستفيد
She has an amazing voice! Would love to hear a high-pitched song from her...
Good talk. Some differences are non-productive when in a country that is not familiar. Like not adopting the language or not adopting central concepts like getting a good education to name a few. Besides that I like the differences in people because it provides unique experiences and expose to thinking in other ways other then my own.
thank you
Great!
Everyone is different and unique, that&#39;s y respect each other and try even to love whoever is that individual.
When I was youth, I was afraid of everything, any person.
NICE

I watch to see how beautiful she is...
الاختلاف ليس ضعفا بل أن تكون مختلفا يعني كونك متميزا و لهذا  خلق الله الناس مختلفين  سبحانك يا الله
What an amazing talk 👍🏼👏👏
Really praising, wonderful..
Iam deference too to how to make issue

If your race commit a crime all the time, do you still stand up or proud of your race or you feel embarassing of your race?
Who wished that video never end ? She is just extremely amazing  in telling stories that make positive impacts.
Lindo de mais a perspectiva do ser humano segundo sua visao.
How cute!
nice
USE THE CODE TO SOLVE FERMAT Always be correct (x^1/a+y^1/a)^na=(z^1/a+x^1//a+y^1/a - z^1/a)^na. Call d=x^1/a+y^1/a - z^1/a =&gt;(x^1/a+y^1/a)^na=(z^1/a+d)^na. They are composed of two groups One group contains x^n,y^n and z^n and the other contains all irrational numbers. z^n=x^n+y^n.   Impossible!
I like the way she speak and her body gestures. Confident powerful and meanwhile calm. The excellent example to learn to speech and communicate with others.
I&#39;m oriental and Jewish so I am not wanted any where...<br>I hope what you are saying is taking place in everyone&#39;s mind.
Amazing and very inspiring speech!
Want to see behind &quot;believe in respect&quot;
I think i’m in love with this woman 🙄
You&#39;re incredible, thank you for doing this
👍🏻
Good

كم انتي رائعة 👏✊👍
I want to learn the language from here
if you want to find something value read about Islam.
Awesome talk ✌
I watched TEDx Talks like a useful way to learn English. But I got some problem to hear that people say. Deas anybody know some tips to improve the listening skill? Please, help me? I come from Vietnam &lt;3
I cried while watching this.. This is beautiful.. I&#39;ve always been thought of as &quot;different&quot; and &quot;weird&quot; but I&#39;m glad I am coz I stayed away from the wrong group of friends who put me down and I know how to stay true and honest with myself, and I&#39;m happier like this! :)
If it has lyrics is perfect 😊😊😊
excellent point on very current issues
Great and powerful girl she is looking very beautiful and also she have so much confidance

America has like a big sweet pie and she is unwilling to share it with folks she deems unworthy. She is right and wrong at the same time.
This is awesome!  I declamated it in my school competition of declamation and won 1st prize.  This video,speech n the deliver is awestrucking!!
Wow  what a personality... Awesome , inspiration .. Read mind  ability 👌
wait she was 7 at that time, and then she mentions snapchat and all that Did it exist during that time??
Try not reading the comments.. form your own opinion on what you listen for if you read the comments you may feel differently just because someone is having a different view.. there&#39;s always something to learn from each other&#39;s life experiences.. Have a nice day!!
&quot;Being able to re-imagine yourself beyond what others see&quot;.. my new motto.. Thanks Mariana for inspiring me :)
interssting
i like your style .and ablity
great all are different and special
At about 12 minutes, there is no mention that the little girl was in fear, because THE MEDIA lied about what trump actually said.. (he does NOT have a golden tongue!!).  The media lied about him mocking a disabled reporter.  The media lied about his attitude towards gays.  The MEDIA lies about and smears anyone who DARES to disagree on with them ANY SINGLE POINT.   The media has lied about who fought slavery, jim crow and racism, and given credit to those who fought FOR slavery, jim crow and racism.  The media has failed to do its job, failed to even try to do its job, of finding and reporting the truth, and shoves its own very shabby agenda....  Lies about &#39;hands up don&#39;t shoot&#39;, and many many others, have done as much damage as the bloody kkk ever did....
Good teacher send me your number for speaking with you please
I sobbed twice..
good
what makes me different  is being so kind and faithful to others
Xuất sắc &lt;3
&quot; am a journalist &quot;, I can see why 🌚
I don&#39;t know, I put a lot of points into charisma but I spec a lot in luck too
Being different and authentic is the key! I have made a video talking about perception and what beauty really means. It would be great if you could check it out! Hope for a change! We are all beautiful!
Lindíssima, falou tudo
indonesia here
Unoriginal, uninteresting, overly boring and cliché. I regret watching it.
I&#39;ve been in the State for 4 years and it still hurts to be different. Cultural difference, language barrier, accent...it&#39;s just hard.
I liked the Palestinian sign that she made at the end!
What makes me different?<br> I got to ask my comrades.<br>Cause I see not difference at all, oops! that&#39;s must be my uniqueness,  no, not at all, <br>I rather ask out, beginning with my purrr-cat.

Everyone&#39;s special is another way of saying no one is.

We as Americans are always expected to bend over backwards and be mindful of others but when we go to other countries we better fit in because they will not do the same

De lo mejor que he visto, de las cosas que le pasan a todo el mundo por lo menos una vez en su vida. De aquí se puede sacar un capitulo de This is us! Excelente, y mucho mejor que venga de Venezuela ya que justo en este momento somos muchos los que nos identificamos con esta charla.. Gracias!
Mariana you left me speechless. Lately, but yeah i felt like i am nothing, but by watching and hearing this video, you truly changed my universe. Now i can say proudly, &quot;i am proud to be different, because that is what defines me as Mitali Srivastava. And thank you for that.&quot;
Stunning speaker

you are great
7. Woman&#39;s ministry and the marriage of homosexuals are the two biggest abominations of the end of times. And a person who enters into a church where women preach, it is like a person who takes part in a parade of homosexuals. 2000 years ago, mankind did not know that one day, homosexuals were going to parade in Jerusalem. 2000 years ago, mankind did not know that one day a woman, despite her menses, was going to preach before people in some churches. [Ed: The congregation says: “Amen!”].<br><br>8. In the entire Old Testament, there was no woman priest. Even in the world, there was no woman minister. It is emancipation that has placed woman there! The feminine for &quot;minister&quot; did not exist. And we know that women came on the scene of the nations through emancipation. The first emancipated woman of the earth was Naamah, a daughter of Cain. And the first emancipated woman in Israel was Jezebel, a foreigner. But in the beginning, it was not so. And we have seen some women fighting for the right to vote in Europe and America but at the beginning in the Old Testament, in Israel for example, women were not counted. And in Africa, a woman cannot be a village chief. Even, in the villages, when men gather, women do not have the right to speak.
She is amazing
V para Venezuela. Vendrán tiempos mejores, EEUU hace todo para hundirse. No tengo accento aleman pq aprendí un año español en la edad de 7 en Caracas. Mariana habla ingles en perfección. Es Pachamama.
My Dad, sent me here, my Dad sent me there, my Dad told me you had to leave.  This is just a living room journalist. The best connection she could find with the girl from Middle East is that Shakira&#39;s family was from there too!  If these are the journalist now, then we are seriously in trouble!!!
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!    *clapping *
were all different, but were all beautiful
only wasting a time

すごく良かった。
I love it :)
i can&#39;t understand why this video dont have spanish sub and have others less importance jajajaajaaj😝
just one word&quot;wow&quot;...
IT IS WONDERFUL.
They must have had lots of money lol
Mariana sure is different from most women.  S&quot;He&quot; has a big shark mouth, brow ridge and sloped forehead on a huge skull.  Her shoulders fit three head lengths.  The hands are so huge it can cover his whole face and then some.<br><br>Don&#39;t be fooled by the &quot;hips&quot;, those are fillers.  Just follow the knees straight up to the hip joints and you will see the hips are smaller than the shoulders.<br><br>Wow, those proportions aren&#39;t even female.  Now THAT is different indeed!
But American think the same today as an adults doesnt have culture
AMAZING!!! I want to spread this to everyone I know! It is so strong and truthful! We all must try revolutionary love!
جميييييل جدا اعجبنى كيفيت التحدث وطريقة الالقاء
Muito bom! Gratitude from Brazil!
i would listen to this a million times!
I loved the speech until she started with the leftist propaganda
اشتركوا بقناتي و مردودةة 😻
I can&#39;t understand maximum sentence.. I am bangladeshi, but her speaking style so smart...
My channel is new! We have Sunday morning sermons and Southern Gospel singing! I would very much appreciate any support! God Bless!
Totally agree!!!

Beautiful asf and smart asf
People use to say the word &quot;different&quot; aways when they&#39;re going to say &quot;we&#39;re the same&quot;.
Excellent talks.....
brilliant body language, so inspiring
So powerful!
Thank u  for this lecture. It has inspired me  so much
My goodness what a gorgeous lady
발음너무좋다
Powerful human right there.
i realised that the world is not made by anything it exist our being ,thanks Nev
Some people should have watched this video more than once before commenting. It is obvious you didn&#39;t got the message or you are one of those who judge people, and you got hit right in your nerves. She hits the nail in a lot of situations, like the one about her sister being in a wheelchair and people instantly labeling her as the &quot;poor girl in a wheelchair&quot; and that is what most of us do with people with disabilities, we automatically label them and treat them different but in the pity way of different when we should treat ANYONE the same way, regardless of their status, physical condition, color of their skin and culture. We are all humans.<br><br>For me as an example, I have tattoos, before I got them, I was just like anybody else, after I got them, I get the &quot;he has tattoos, must be a gang member, a criminal, a crazy man&quot; type of looks from most people, some people won&#39;t come near me cause they think I might want to harm them. The point? we don&#39;t see past the things that make people different and or special. It&#39;s easier to label and judge than having the balls to get to know people and see what&#39;s behind those different things.
This was a waste of time.
God, our Creator, made us special.
I wanna check how deep is Mariana&#39;s trench.
You looks cute
Most amazing ted talk I have ever watched since Ted was born
She is a clearly dominant girl. The way she talks about her memories - she has never been intimidated by americans, maybe she was perceived as &quot;the other&quot; but it never intimidated her. So first of all, she doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s talking about. Shakira memory - did she think the whole school raised their hands because she was EMBRACING that she was DIFFERENT? They all raised hands because Shakira was famous and hot, and the girl was dancing. It has nothing to do with her difference - it could&#39;ve been white girl up there - would&#39;ve been same reaction. She has never been the DIFFERENT one. Fatima was. However, Fatima wasn&#39;t special. In fact, she knows nothing about Fatima. But she points out how different Fatima just using word &quot;special&quot; instead. Maybe enough with interchangeable concepts? No matter what she calls it - different or special or muslim or brown - all she does is point out that Fatima is not like her. And maybe lose the idea that we are all so special. We are not, none of us are. Maybe when we realize that we are not as precious as we think we are, we will understand the importance of having one another, and all the similarities we share.

Am touched Mariana thank you..
&quot;this has built a strong belief in myself&quot;
There&#39;s something about her, that is very attractive! She makes you want to listen to her talk all day
you already said it. they broke the LAW. Period.
Don&#39;t say that they are other it demolished! :-) beautiful
Great story.
TEDx Talk thanks for you give we some spetch but one quirks is that some video are different country and those people tune is different type so plz do the  subtitles on videos.
I have opened her instagram page second ago because I liked her personality, and i saw she lost her dad a week ago..this is so sad
Come on baby this is a speech for teenagers and it&#39;s good.
My extreme level of ugliness is what is special about me
Tuyệt vời quá!! - <br>Hello i&#39;m from Vietnam
We&#39;ve got very fine winter right now ...
👍. Very good Ted talk.<br>It helped this issue get so clear !<br>We start very like, but we are &quot;colored&quot; by our surruoudings i think.
thanks
queria comentar pero no entiendo ingles . solo guarani y castellano
Beautiful lady!
This was the best 17 minuets in my life
Wao it&#39;s really interesting and inspiring
I&#39;m venezuelan too and I have been following Mariana for so long now. I´m watching this knowing that her father passed away a few days ago and hearing this story right now is so touching. She is such an empowering woman. I&#39;m amazed.
Uau❤ meus olhos se encheram de lágrimas
Muito bom
It was beautiful.
すごくわかる。
Sounds nervous
Such a beautiful speech. It really means a lot to all of us. Make peace ✌️ not prejudice.
I simply loved it. Unffortunately this talk is still necessary!!! Lets celebrate our humanity! There arent human races, there are not better or worst races! We are all equal. But once we dont see ourselves as equals, we create power structures that opress the Others.
So amazing what u had done in ur lyf i hope u make success in every stage
nuthin, thx, tchüss
Different girl !!
Jo
This is children&#39;s talk.  Ones you get to be 40 or 50, or even 60. then you start to realize that we all suffer from the same pains
Beautiful
Hawt
No matter who you are, but what you bring to this world, what are you dreaming of, and how you make it happen.
It is so beautiful.  Thank you so much.
Avoid to make norms in our lives
she is amazing. because l learned many thing for her
I stutter and I am very imaginative.
Whorebag bellydancing lol
All of us are special, you just have to accept that we are all different and unique in our own special way. Don&#39;t compare yourself with other people because that&#39;s the beginning of jealousy. Be contented of who you are because we all have different road maps  to follow in life.
I appreciate the outlook. Don&#39;t meander on stage when speaking. You can move to another place purposefully, but then arrive and stay there a bit. You can move again and again. Just don&#39;t wander back and forth. It&#39;s distracting. I liked the speech.
Wonderful girl, ❤️
👏👏👏
可愛い
thank you so much for sharing this thought abot how special we are.
Nice video
very good. but i disagree with the minutes of the show after Obama is mentioned... the causes are so much bigger than just seeing people &quot;different&quot; and these causes must change before our attitude can made a difference. i believe the changes should start from the top. other than that, i agree and can relate.
Deport this demon
News alert.....!! We all have different DNA...we are all special and unique.
Muito linda a mensagem! é engraçado como ela se parece com a Anita aqui do Brasil.
That was a great talk. Yes let&#39;s celebrate our perfect imperfections. Thank you for opening our minds and hearts .
Nice
She&#39;s beautiful
wow
wow what a quite story so boring now every single experience make a story wow
Wow
👍🏻👍🏻💐
I sent many messages to Mr bill your husband no answer. We need food only nobody work nobody help.. If u human and has feels save us we need food food food fooooooooood
Mariana is inspiring and a good role model -to all of us!
i really agree with her, being different is good. we’re all our god’s masterpiece! being born with disability, being born lgbt.. we’re all the same just differ from face and attitudes  but we’re all the same. we’re not born to meet others expectation..just be you! ;))
She’s very very beautiful. I love u
Fatima was stick to her culture and happy in that way  but what makes you happy does not make Fatima Happy. thts the difference
❤️ this! No one deserves to be bullied for being different from the others.
Why try to fit in when we were born to stand out!
ah woow let me say that mariana is very extremely great women .and also she has very quite wonderful accent then the story was interesting .may god bless you
I&#39;m different too, because I&#39;m not going to give up to do the things that I love the most, that makes me happy and special.
Mind blowing.. Amazing speech!!
I am Arabic girl like Fatima<br>Who is like me?
WoW, I am in love!
Why would I listen to a women whos biggest importants is appearance?shes a liar too, she says the little girl is in fear, but the little girl is smiling. The kids don&#39;t know anything about politics other than what you tell them. If YOU tell them Donald Trump is going to deport their mother, YOU will scare them, so...STOP IT!
Wow I have many special and different friends who are like my family they came illegally they become many obstacles like language work a new country no friends or family and they still make it and all to give their kids a better life. After today I have a different perspective of my friends I&#39;m sure they didn&#39;t had it as easy as me and that didn&#39;t stop them from make it big!
&quot;When you&#39;re different you have to work at belonging.&quot; Who said that?
Wow... such ignorance, sad.
Tienes la oportunidad de llegar a mucha gente, hoy en día parece que el gobierno no acepta personas que no sean caucasicas, trata de que escuchen tu voz y que ayuden a la economía de los países pobres para que no exista tanta pobreza y tengan que venir a sufrir desprecios de racistas.
Awesome

I support Donald Trump.
Miss Mariana, I watched your entire video, because you show the audience, and myself, that we are not better than anyone else.<br>Like you, I was an alien/immigrant, not from Caracas, but from neighboring Trinidad. I now live in Canada, where I am exposed to all types of people, good and bad. I have learnt that you have to embrace and believe in &quot;respect&quot;, (just like you had on your jersey), so all can feel comfortable and safe.  For helping so many people that watched your video, I say &quot;Muchas Gracias&quot;
Güzel konuşma
She&#39;s ridiculous. She&#39;s never been a refugee. HEr parents had enough money to send her to any place they wanted to, properly supported, looking nothing like a refugee. I live in a third world country and I am actually stuck here, as I dont have the assets required to flee to anywhere else, and I would never do it illegally. . The whole point in her speech is just to make Donald Trump, who is trying to protect their people and their land, look like a cruel bandit. I agree with him: the third world countries should clean up their mess and stop exporting starving people, else in the future there wont be left one single place good to live in the world.
I have nothing that make me  stand out the crowd. And I&#39;m okay with that. I guess we should stop needing this kind of assurance, and just be okay in our not special skins.

She was speaking without  thinking because words r coming from her Real life which she was experienced
Great talk! - Thank you, it makes me fight for everyone on the planet!
Phenomenal ~
Great talk Mariana.
bem globalista como discurso. Eles querem mudar o povo americano, onde eles aceitam tudo, exceto serem o que são: um povo que ama à Deus e devem aceitar tudo: homossexuais, imigrantes que trazem suas religiões esquisitas, máfia, e pessoas que desejam destruir os EUA e os islamizar. Ela vê tudo pelo seu prisma. Triste isso.

I agree with Mariana! She gives us a lesson. Good video!!
I may have a special story for her. I need her phone no.
thank you for  the lovely  video . its very motivational .
One of a famous Hindi song&#39;s lyrics fits here:<br><br>&quot;Maine yehi socha hai aksar<br>tu bhi main bhi sabhi hain sheeshe<br>khud hi ko hum sabhi mein dekhen<br>nahi hoon main hoon main to phir bhi<br>sahi galat tumhara main<br>mujhe paana paana hai khud ko&quot;<br><br>This is what it means:<br><br>I have often thought,<br>that you, me, all of us are mirrors,<br>we see only ourselves in all,<br>I am not there still I am..<br>right, wrong, yours me,<br>I have to get.. get my own self..
Being me and not you makes me very different
wow v.good
very nice sharing
no body is normal every body is different  you should be proud for different and never try to change your self for any person
good speech
Her argument is unreasonably,ofc if I see a girl in wheelchair,I will thing that is a poor girl can&#39;t walk....what else can I think,she can run fast?it need time to understand she is a successful lawyer or something else,but first time saw her,ofc just a poor girl on wheelchair,no one can read mind...I think her argument is full of mistake,being kind doesn&#39;t mean read mind.
Send illegal immigrant back to their country have anything wrong?for example,a poor pitiful man rush into your house,eat your food,why can&#39;t send him back.If you are rich and want to help him,ofc you can do it,but other people don&#39;t have the duty to help him because him came in illegal.We need focus on the difference between illegal immigrant and legal immigrant,we need respect the law.If poor and pitiful is the reason to break law,why we create law?
no to racism
what a shity talk !.. Ted talks çok bozdu
She is so confident on the stage i like her speech
this is really a very good speech..
This made me cry a little

I watched this and just couldn&#39;t leave without dropping a comment. This speaker is brave to speak out loud of this topic. We all are indeed different yet we also  have something extraordinary  that makes us stand out. <br>Always embrace who you are! :)
Great sound!!
Maal h:D
if we label someone different it dehumanizes them,lets embrace and appreciate what makes others different,great speech love from uganda
I&#39;m different because i got on my period in the middle of 4th grade and none of my other classmates didn&#39;t
I&#39;m special because there is a girl who loves me no matter what.
Hello , I have one question. I am from Azerbaijan and I am student how can we particape in  TEDx Talks? Can you give information, please?
“don’t let them define you.”<br><br>I strongly agree of what she had said, because each and everyone of us is unique and no one can ever destroy you unless you let them. Being yourself is a way to make a better life. Do not be afraid to be different because being different is being unique. I really love the message, Keep inspiring! 💛
What a beautiful woman
She looks like troian bollisario from Pll in the thumbnail

America  is for Americans first .if Americans not want to share their country  people should leave their country and should go into their country and should start a fight to make their country their own heaven .I&#39;m Indian but I can feel when someone try enter in others home . spread love not hate

when I watched this presentation, I realized that struggling to be normal to feel composure makes conversely me feel ill at ease . just what i must do is to admit who i am. thank you for great advice!!
amazing speech
سمعت المحاضره بس ما عرفت ليش انا غير ؟؟🙃<br>في حد مثلي 🌚
As diferenças tornam o mundo interessante, nesta procura para ser normal ou se adequar a determinado padrão é necessário pessoas como a Mariana Atencio, sua irmã, você e eu para com coragem ser primeiro apenas um ser humano que por si só é especial.<br>Obrigado Mariana, parabéns pela palestra! Excelente.
&quot;You are the script writer and the co-director of the Movie. Your story is a unique One, be wise and Prudent enough to tell it as it is&quot; - WArie Blip Porbeni.<br>A great speech. Mariana, i love your story!!!!
From 2000 to 2013 I had been living an empty life without any pleasure or mere thread of hapiness because I was emprisoned and manipulated in my job by my supervisor who exploited all my energy to his favour it was like magic on me. I didn&#39;t realise that untill I fell very sick and I was about to die only then I sat down with myself and passed through several difficulties I couldn&#39;t walk or sleep ...... and I promised my self if I stand up again I will never let anyone interfere in my life or deviate me from any choice or track I choose for myself ... today thank God I am free and realized many things I was seeing impossible ......
This is an extremely powerful message
got here just because of pretty hot chick on the preview :D
Why i am feeling so emotional after watching this?

She says the Venezuelan government shut down the biggest TV station in their country - censorship was growing, Dad says &quot;How are you going to be a journalist HERE?&quot;<br><br>So she packs her bags in 2008 and came to the United States without a return ticket.  <br><br>WHAT? A communist government involved in CENSORSHIP?  OUR OWN LEFT says only the Alt Right does THAT!!
Talk seems somewhat unrelated to the title. Could probably use a different title that isn&#39;t as misleading.
1000 people don&#39;t like this talk? Not human?
Gracias Mariana por compartir tus experiencias! Que Dios siga iluminando tu camino!
WOW!!!!!!!!! you are Beautiful LOVEEEEEEEEEE YOU
Yup be different is an advantage,enhancing your uniqueness.
Nice

Great talk❤️ happy New Year 2018!
she&#39;s so smart and beautiful...hope i could have half of that confidence one day
Beautiful, logical talk. Stil, the reality is so various. You pointed out just one aspect of reality.  if &quot;an alien&quot; comes to my place uninvited, trying to make me behave the way he likes, harming my family, he&#39;s an intruder to me. I defend myself and my family. So it is not so simple, Mariana.
This is amazing
I live in the basement but the question when will I try to break the door 😪
You are different. I admire it.
Shes hot!
This is like the movie Wonder I love it!
lovely
so what about Fatima?
Brought me to tears. Incredible
Thank you for those powerful words
Every country should take care of their own people.The day of immigration as the solution to problems is over.
Lol im different somehow

I am different. always want something special, love uncommon things, and do what others don&#39;t do.

The experience changing your life toward the road of successfully.
HA!
I&#39;m different too! ..... i like this talk so much .... she was talking about her story!  and I was thinking how her story looks like mine.
Truely true
Ended well - we are human - we all came in different bodies- having one thing in common, our humanness.  Being different should not be frowned on but celebrated!!!!
Interesting speech though my perspective is completely different to the speakers, I decided at a very young age that I wanted to be different to everyone else, at 7 I became the only vegetarian in a family of 7, (48 years later still am a vegetarian) at the time when all my friends discovered alcohol and pubs I decided to become t-total (I still do not drink) when all my school friends chose football teams to support I decided I did not like football, when all my friends started to find their taste in music and went to concerts I decided that I did not enjoy music and still have no time for it, I guess I always wanted to stand out from the crowds and not follow trends like a sheep, so when all my friends discovered designer labels I laughed at them for wasting their money. choosing your own path in life will always make you feel better about yourself, and stop you making mistakes just because everyone is is doing it. but our sentiments are the same, enjoy who you are and embrace being different.
She is a journalist.. But she dont know how to breath ro speak correctly..?! Wtf!!
This why I’m interesting to learn differents languages
Why everybody laugh but i dont cause i dont know her speak about somthing. Actually i am vn
The first thing I notice you was oh she is Katrina Kaif 😂😂 anyway you look so astonishing and gorgeous and a very inspiring message..
❤
Paper very important. That all you must remember.
Fabulous! Gina in Lights!!
being muslim,  I can relate it to this in so many ways, this really touched my heart.
Different is better 💯
wonderful speech
We mustn&#39;t judge other people for every different quality,we live 21.century.Please we are be together our mistakes.
Bon c&#39;est pas mal au début, mais j&#39;ai arrêté quand elle a parlé de censure au Vénézuela en omettant, bien entendu, de préciser que les chaînes fermées étaient pilotées par les colons impérialistes étasuniens et n&#39;avaient comme seule objectif que de saboter l&#39;expérience socialiste, comme partout ailleurs où de telles tentatives ont été tentées, pour mieux s&#39;emparer des ressources, du pétrole notamment. Dommage, ça avait pourtant pas trop mal commencé !<br><br>Well it&#39;s not bad at first, but I stopped when she talked about censorship in Venezuela by omitting, of course, to specify that the closed chains were piloted by the Americans imperialists colonists  and had as only objective that to sabotage the socialist experience, as everywhere else where such attempts have been made, to better seize resources, especially oil. Too bad, it had not started too badly !
agreed with you Mariana. Being different and positive is important
This speech is inspiring . In my life , i faced many struggles . And these struggles had affected me . These struggles changed many things . But , i know god is up there , he sees everything and knows what i face . I really do appreciate god , he knows me more than my parents . Everyone in life should take the courage to try to fix their problems . And as she said in the video “ our differences make us special “ love who you are appreciate it
thank you
I don&#39;t know what makes me different, that means nothing makes me set off. But it is a meaningful video, esspecially for different people, they are all shining!
¡Viva Venezuela! She really inspired me. I&#39;m a Journalism student from Venezuela. :)
absolutely loved this. <br>needed this at the right time.<br>Thank you.

we are all unique. isn&#39;t that an oxymoron? yet it&#39;s true
Difference is a point of view, not a fact, we all are human beings.
We are all unique? So who’s the mos unique? god this is confusing
&quot;Take a stand to defend your race, the human race.&quot; Beautiful!

What a shame that Venezuela is collapsing to socialism.  Too bad the people have no power to fight back and make their country great again, like it once was.  Too bad a talented Mariana Atencio cannot have a dream of saving Venezuela.
She is attractive,
Fist night international travel

&quot;You&#39;re so unique,&quot; my friends told me. I think I should find what makes me special?? NO, it isn&#39;t important, cuz everybody all special.
She&#39;s beautiful and hot!  The best product from Venezuela.
I wanna be her.
Another Um silly question did Fatima ever believe in Voltaire or she chose Koran to be a better bet?
Um did u ask Fatima how she felt about LGBT rights?
Oh Sob , cant stop crying some body get me a scarf um sorry I mean tissue, oh my god I cant stop I m raining tears, oh Fatima would you luv having a hamburger , with ham inside, oh um oops sorry please don&#39;t behead me, I never knew pork could bring on this side of you, um , ok , should I have to convert? um , wear a scarf, um, oh pretty please, do tell me what would I have to do to make you pipe down, to make you take away that knife and get out of that suicide vest? sigh just wondering  how come nobody ever comes in stage being apologists for other religions like Hindus, Jews, Sikhs, et al,
I don&#39;t understand anything, but she&#39;s beautiful))
you are special

For some people, immigration is a business. They need to pay, and take the risk. For some people, immigration is a gift for free. Do you think it&#39;s fair?
The prominence of &quot;being special&quot; could be explained pretty much.Thanks for it
If an illegal immigrant has the &quot;right&quot; to ignore the immigration laws of a country,  shouldn&#39;t we have the &quot;right&quot; to not register our cars with the DMV? or not be forced to buy insurance? I would also like to not pay taxes. You see there are reasons for laws. Those that believe that all humans have the right to ignore artificial borders should put their case forward to the public and get current immigration law repealed. Until that time, enforce the immigration laws just as we enforce laws in other sectors of society.
that&#39;s amazing ,wonderful
I loved her way  at talking very very very much ✨✨
Thank you madam.. your speech really impressed to me
Çok zekice ve duygusal bir konuşma. Sanırım aşık oldum.<br>I love you so much Mariana Atentico
So beautiful and smart
I love you Mariana ❤
As an Afro Hispanic I&#39;m so proud of your message.  I new you were special when I saw your report on Puerto Rico on Cable news.  La Raza (hispanic culture) is our comon denominator; we latinos are all very giving and eager to help.  I came to America at age 6 and remember in 1964 our American life was very different. I never new what racism or hate was.  I&#39;m still that six year old in character and wish we all can listen to Mariana. She has explained &quot;us&quot; finally.
Very good
great job . i whish much speaking english very good and meet the people froom different culture
Türkleri görelim 😂
いらない子状態でこの講義を聞いて、人付き合いの突破口になる話を聞けたなって思って感謝してます。日本は働ける人間を選んでる感じがどうしてもある気がします。よそ者感って心が苦しいです。
Wanted a speech about being special? Sorry! You get a rant on Donald Trump!
This is great!
&quot;I knew they weren&#39;t trying to be mean.&quot; - Riiiiiiiiggggggghhhhhht
Your speech was really inspiring. You are so brave to stand there and talk about your life and how immigrants feel in their new home. I love it!

Teach me a thing or two about belly dancing...? orientalist view much..? <br>Although her overall message is OK, there is still an underlying sense of ignorance in her talk with respect to the Middle East/ Muslims :/
Oh thks god !! It&#39;s so amazing about vietsub because my english isn&#39;t good !! She is so great woman
Oh thks god !! It&#39;s so amazing about vietsub because my english isn&#39;t good !! She is so great woman

I love you
Making a friend is always a special reward.
No one is special we are all the same.

She is so strong and amazing i liked her so much 💗💗 i hope to be like her by the will of Gad some day 💗💗
I have watched this Remarkable Speech for more than 20 times and will keep on watching. It has electrified my soul and the Power of words are kissing my intrinsic part of my Body.
Very, very good! I love you, and I love the video. It is a great message to all us! I am from Venezuela too. You are a great person, I hope the best for you, your sister, and you family. &lt;3
best talk i&#39;ve ever heard
Powerful Speech!
Thank you, Mariana! Her speech was very touched my heart. Yes, we’re different.
Awesome!
powerful
she&#39;s so beautiful and smart.
Where are tge fallout comments?
I love it how she has no accent, its hard but possible
Hi Mariana, being exposed to English from an early age has certainly made you sound like a native speaker! That shows latins they can also speak great English if they are given the right opportunities and if they have courage to communicate with no fear!<br>Also, it&#39;s been great using your talk to help my students  and myself learn more about English and about life!  VERY INSPIRING! Thank you so very much! Luciana form Brazil!
What a powerful talk !
جميل جداً
Super talk
in another way, i step here to improve my  English, and I Wonder who can give me a reaction and training for me about  speaking and listening please.... just taking some dialouges daily throuh skyped. I really want to speak English in nature but My environment doesn&#39;t allow me to to that.
.... What a great lesson for all of us!  You are welcomed here anytime! God Bless you
America is no longer a great country after Trump
Absolutely correct

Amazing talk &lt;3 &lt;3
جامده جدا الكلمه مؤثرة عااااش :) thank you
Love this. ^__^
She&#39;s fantastic
Mind blown! What a talk. 👏
Let’s start posting what makes each one of us different. <br>My odd facial features, long face, long nose and big ears.  Make me different.
address the ecomonic abuse and impact of illegal aliens, becuase it is not sustainable for a nation no matter how special we are.....
It&#39;s amazing how we identify with every word the other person speaks, especially when that person is the opposite and different from us, I just love the difference that exists between each of us, that makes us who we truly are.
i hope speak like her    ++++  <br>who can teach me or help me .
Experience new culture. <br>Summer camp nightmare.<br>No cellphone. Campfire. Another planet. Just laugh. Make a relation with their world.
Bravo!
AMAZING
Strong and beautiful❤
So my mother language wasn&#39;t english.<br>But this Woman speaks very fluently and i can hear her clearly without missing a word.
I&#39;m only joking thanks for the talk you are an angel
All those diverse socio-cultural experience blended with the eloquence in presenting it has made the insight of the viewers much more profound. She has created the sense of epiphany.
what if your not beautiful

I have tried many Forex and binary option strategies all to no avail but losing always whenever i trade, i contacted many account managers with their strategies yet the same lost suffered by me, until i contacted Mr Frank Robert who took the challenges off me and gave me a new beginning in the market that i am enjoying today with huge returns of capital up to $20 Thousand us.dollar almost every week, he is a real dealer in terms of managing Forex and binary option accounts with good strategy.
👍👍👍✌
she&#39;s sooo  beautiful
Good lord she&#39;s gorgeous
مرحلة المراهقة اصلا يبدا التفكير ذو الطابع العالمي او على قولتها الانساني يعني مرت بطريقة التفكير الطبيعية لسنها
This is really shallow hhh and straight forward
This is one of the most beautiful and kindful things I&#39;ve seen or heard. I think I&#39;m embracing the power, the energetic words you said, we feel like we don&#39;t belong anywhere because of our different aspects or thoughts, when arguably these are our best weapon. And we should be happy with it! You&#39;re so brave, inspirational helping everyone, including myself to not be afraid to be yourself. Kudos Mariana!!!
Im in love
Her voice is full of power.
She is a powerful girl and she knew what she will talked about I liked her

She is very beautiful
That would be really nice to make out with her!
great message. really inspired. Thanks
good speaker
彼女の話は実体験をまじえていて、凄く引き込まれました。
なにもしらない子供同士なのに人種差別が起きてしまうのは大人が未だにそういう思想を持っているからでしょうね。なんとなく大人が言っていることを信用し、差別をしてしまう。大人になってもその子供の時の経験はなかなか変えられない。
it&#39;s so cool speech i love it
What a beauty
gorgeous speak
Beautiful
A story that inspired me very much Thank you
Well, she tells a lot of things and a lot of stories, but not pointing right at some subject.
Everyone talks about immigrants and their issues. What about US citizens and their problems ? I am an  immigrant still I think there are some real issues  going on with citizens. Otherwise Trump would never got elected. Funny thing is she can not do the same in Venezuela.
I am being attrected by her attractiveness
Respect for You Ma&#39;m. Great motivational Speech. Thank you . Iam a self made person who slept on roads once.

I like the way that she gave a speech deliberately and fluently.

Mariana, I&#39;d love to give you a big hug. It is beautiful you take courage to celebrate your differences and imperfections. Very wise speech by the way.
Now I really feel proud to be a Latina.. but most of my life I wanted to be like those American Californian girls I saw on tv shows...
The talk is precisely awesome!
هل يوجد عرب؟
i love her talkings way. she  amazing and she had self-confidence and i wanna be like her l hope that relly <br>thank you teds group and the translation ( Arabic translation)
hats off!!!  felt like she talked her heart out..
The talk which makes you think different. Such kind of ideas must be spread among kids at schools so that they can be brought up tolerant from the beginning. It will help them in lifetime by avoiding thoughts of dominance several group of people over others or thoughs of hatred which block our minds and misleading us. Clear and tolerant mind significantly alleviates our lives and gives more time and energy to come on truly required businesses. As world history keeps proving a society full of prejudice experiences more difficulties what causes even more problems. To be tolerate and try to understand other people is what we need right now. That&#39;s not possibly a walkover but it&#39;s needed.
There is no other.<br><br>Let me know when you think you understand what i mean.
simply in love with this channel and the people here teaching so many beautiful things by telling their experiences of life....<br><br>its always wonderful to come on the channel and watch any video..<br><br>insuring, motivating, nothing much to say its just owsem 😊👌
Very nice. Nice speech.
I should like you.
The United States is a great country because of people like Mariana Atencio are here.
thật thú vị
The speach is So powerful and she is so beautiful 👏👏👏👏🖒<br>Ttrying to fit thats the story of my Whole entire life; i am so touched by this lecture.<br>
Good job...Cheers
is this a type of persuasive speech?
This video encourages me to pursue my dream as a sports marketer. Since I was young i loved watching and playing sports and eventually i deciced to work in the sports field in the future. However, where i&#39;m living now, south korea has a very small sports industry so I wanted to study abroad and achieve my dream in the bigger world. Somewhere the industries are larger and where i can be a bigger person. But nowadays i was concerned and frightened about what the others spoke to me about how narrow the path is to become a sports markerter as an asian woman. These talks make me reconsider about my dream and become timid about my goal. I was frightened about the sterotypes and  how people will see me. However, mariana&#39;s speech really helped me to be couraged and again be passionate about my dream again. Thank you so much
Dear Marian Antico*<br>Your efforts of Upstanding on Right to preserve Human right  activity is wilfull trust on my view.
Dear Marian Antico*<br>Your  lifeCircle  has have many intervene obstackles are hard to struggle.<br>Your efforts of Upstanding on Right to preserve Human right  activity is wilfull trust on my view.
we are all different and that makes us wonderful. She is really fabulous !!!!!!!
SHE IS PRETTY .
How can you people congratulate her on this talk when she treated Fatima so baldy?
That&#39;s right. she is very good journalist and now, i undrstand  that she is Excellent speaker too.
One of the best videos that I  have ever watched in TEDx. Thanks Mariana. :)
a really warming and moving talk.   the quote &quot;While I may disapprove of what you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it&quot; is not from Voltaire but from Evelyn Beatrice Hall who wrote a biography of Voltaire and was trying to illustrate Voltaire&#39;s position.
She is so hot. Like smokin.
she&#39;s beautiful
beautiful..
It’s just funny cuz something similar just had happened to me...
THANK YOU SISTER FOR YOUR GOOD STORIE IT MAKES ME HOPE
Awesome!
brought me to tears. Such a powerful speech.
not one second wasted. every word was gold
Being different is Awesome!! I adore being Unique an different**
You&#39;ll feel special if that person respect you for who you are and what you are.
Hi..
Mariana is correct when somebody say YOU are different it makes me hurt a lot as many people treat me like this too...but I am brave, bold and will STAND UP SOON ON MY OWN.
GREAT Speech....<br>Appriciating somone really feel Special.
Nice speech..., inspired me a lot
Omg, she&#39;s pretty!!
Lindo pensar assim, uma pena que existam pessoas que simplesmente explodem umas as outras, e seja justamente essas que ela defende. Historinhas bonitas e tocantes só fazem as pessoas não enxergarem a realidade, o preço por ignorar a realidade pode ser alto.
I am Canadian, but it seems illegal immigrants in the US break immigration laws, but the laws are not written to protect those who have given their lives to building the country.
Heloo i want to speak wit you&amp;@#)$#@$&quot; realitiy and sence of yout tu be sister accident honest best <br>your knidnder .<br>are you marriedddddddmfei
Querida Mariana, desde la cálida Valencia del Rey en Carabobo, Venezuela te envio miles de bendiciones. Me haces sentir orgulloso del gentilicio venezolano, del cual eres digna representante. Esta charla debe llegar hasta el ùltimo rincon del Planeta...
She is cute
That was amazing.
Basically anyone who has ever been an immigrant can relate to what she said. The thing is that the immigrants who came before will always treat the next wave of immigrants like outsiders, so we all need to be aware of our actions about how we treat newcomers to our country. Except when the British came to America they&#39;ve practically made the Native Americans go extinct. The Native Americans were treated horribly by the British even though the British were the new coming immigrants.
The rights words in the right moment. Thank you very much. Arriba Venezuela ❤️
Wow! This brought tears to my eyes and inspires me!
she looks so amazing
superb.... being human is what we all need too....
Awesome
thanks to appreciate only human being exclude all relegions
This is so eye opening I love this so much &lt;3 Chica que linda me ha hecho el dia!! Sabia
wow
Mariana! How did you become that confident? I met one girl from your country and i feel like it does run in your culture. I mean your public speaking skills are a standout. Any tips?
Bravo Bravo Bravo
beautiful lady&#39;s beautiful speach..
Great talk smart women.
Amazing    very helpful...thanks a lot
Mariana, simplemente el mejor Tedx que he visto. ¡Eres grande!
I am going american friend
amazing person u r!!!!!!
perfect
awsome and beautiful girl
si es latinoamericana por que no se permite a los hispanohablantes entender lo que dice. Posibilidades  de subtitulos
The ironic thing is North Americans are a lot diverse in todays society... :P
a great speech
Great speech. But why she mentioned Donald Trump in negative way, being in contradiction with her own words? The fear connected with Donald Trump presidency is exactly &quot;normal&quot; in the sense of Mariana&#39;s speech, what means that in reality is (that DT fear) a kind of inmaturity. So let stop it, let Donald Trump be different! Maybe it will be better for us (not only for him), for our humankind in us.
Because Obama made us think he was going to bring our country together but he more than obviously for those that have their eyes open divided our country more than ever.
She watched the 2016 Election with Undocumented immigrants. She just cannot say illegal immigrants. why did she not tell that little girl her parents were in America illegally ?  Her parents are not like past immigrants who came to America Legally and wanted to become Americans.
Way to go Mariana&#39;s dad and Mariana. Listening to this speech makes me proud to be special and to be different!<br>Thank you Mariana.
3rd point is best af all
I came here just cause she is hot
she&#39;s so hot so I can&#39;t focus on what she is saying haha
MARIANA, You are  really good on stage delivering speech and keeping audience.... to keep an eye on you... watching.. make them never boring. WOW!! its  interesting. By the way, you are beautiful ...in all sense.
videolara türkçe altyazı da ekleyin lütfen bazı arkadaşlarım anlamadığını söylediler :)
a great speach...  people should think that everybody is human
What a great lesson for all of us , thank you so much
Wow...so she is teaching us how to accept others...what a profound topic (ironic). i guess ted sucks big time now.
I&#39;m sure there are many damn asses which still can&#39;t understand. what will make them understand is third world war :(
Excellent speech, what a great woman and person.
Not being special makes me speacial I gues...
Wonderful talk
WOW!!! <b>_</b>
It is a very interesting lecture.  :D
What she said can help us to change our lives!
can you explain for me. i can&#39;t understand
the way she talks is so soothing
I like her
Inspiring speech,you have great empathy......
Wonderful talk &amp; wonderful woman 👩
sh&#39;s pretty journalist girl, really!<br>what she said will be verified, as always..
O inglês dela é tão claro e de fácil compreensão &lt;3
The more people try to point out their victim status the more they are victimised .    Illegal immigrants need to stay home and not put their families in jeopardy .  We have enough problems here.  The United States needs to have time to assimilate those who have already come here . Go back to your country and fight to make it a better place rather than come here and make us like the place you left.  We want our own culture here and we are tired of apologizing for this.
Downvote me if you want but she is so hawtttt
I love Ted Talks a lot! I wanna improve my English skills. Who does wanna speak English to me? We improve our skills.. Someone wanna join?
Impressive speech!! She&#39;s both sympathetic, beautiful and talented &lt;3
so nice experience that add to personality  good things

I liked this talk, it takes courage to admit our faults, like she did, and her message, is valid, precisely in this times it&#39;s needed, I hope people get it
it&#39;s an amazing speech, i really needed to hear such words! this talk definitely made my day, thank you
according to me  ,all  what  you  said is  right  and  wonderful ,so we  have  to  defend our human being identity   and  we  have  to  consider that  the  world  is  our  big  home
Reno up in the houseee!!!! Couldn&#39;t agree with you more, Great talk Mariana your beautiful!!!

I loved it! I think I watched it more than twice.
she is look great.beside her all suggestion is very important for our life..
Its funny when she talks about the lockers. Nobody is laughing except me here at home. For americans its like oh yea lockers, standard, and oh yea yellow school busses, standard. And everybody from somewhere else (in my case germany) gets to America, sees a bus and goes like HOOOOOOOLYYYYYYYYY SHEIT THEY ACTUALLY EXIST!!! Or you walk into the university the first time and see a row of lockers like NOOO WAY IT IS REALLL! :D
I wish I could speak as confidently as you did.. great talk! 🖒
waoooooo mam beautiful
Beautiful!
great video :)
MARIANA, LOVE UUU SO MUCH BCUZ EXCELLENT SPEECH. GOOD
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
thanks
كلام حميل verry good
I thougth i Was the only one special, this has me thinking, yea maybe everyone is special, maybe.
More you see different places, people,... More you experience the wonders of the world...
How could you? Fatima is a good name... I remember reading a book by Paulo Coelho.. but demn, that was some powerful speech right there..<br>That was a good one.. Defend the human race... Cause it&#39;s the only thing we have in common...
Different is good
We are different, but that difference makes me!
She is simply AMAZING!
Very good
Thanks 🙏
Mariana helped me a lot with my self esteem.
i agree with her , her subject is a true matter , but as some people are very smart and stand out , there are very dumb and poor minded people aswell, and i am sorry to break the ice  ,but those people should not have the right to vote or &quot;burst their bubble&quot; , like religious fanatics , flat-earth theory supporters .
She is natural when she says
loved
lo puse por casualidad y me sorprendí al escuchar que eras de Venezuela! omg saludos!!
I love her voice &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
Is she an American?
She was good! nice insightful talk, indeed.
Wow, what a wonderful speech her words truly inspired me.
I love video
So true! Sending you love from Brazil
Good speech Mariana, keep up the good work...Yes, as a human being we should all love  each other
Thank you so much Mariana !!!
Oh God! She&#39;s so cute! ♥

to be successful you gotta be different...if everyone choses to go right then go left....Agree??
She is pretty and positive that&#39;s great
Beautiful, stylish, confident and smart too.
thank you
wow is really extraordinary story with lovely sound . peace i love you Mariana
worst way to waste 17mins n 46 seconds
Hey, if any of you have time, I just started a spoken word channel and it would mean a lot if you would check it out! :)
I would date her.
Mam, It was fantastic talk. You are doing awesome work.

Amazing this!!! Thanks so much share your life history!! Kisses from Brazil!! Congratulations!
Remove girl and music. Follow islam and get salvation. No religigion will be accepted except Islam on the day of judgment.
rubbish!<br>if you want to make little Angelina worthy - tell her to embrace herself and to go and work on reshaping her country, instead of reshaping herself into &#39;proud illegal&#39;
Very good story!
she has a great father, a great chance to open her life in other country. Those are big experience! what should i do if i am just normal? don&#39;t have a dream, don&#39;t have any special talent, don&#39;t have much budget. I am also a kind of introvert. i just can fight if i have to be put in difficult situation. I want to have another life but i don&#39;t know what I should do.... I am just dissapointed with my self.
puede alguien traducirlo al español :(?
woww she is really beautiful!
you are right (l knew little English I want to be prefect and I an native Arabic I can help you with Arabic if you want )meet me on whatsapp 00967715253593 thanks
very.good
Mariana touches you deep because she speaks from her heart and from first hand experiences.... her honesty with herself has helped her understand diversity in a profound way. We&#39;re so fortunate today to have a massively connected global society that allows me in Jordan to see and hear her in Nevada. Our distrust of the other or xenophobia can now be easily overcome with a little mining on the web... We need to embrace the power of web and build on it toward more understanding and a better future.

So powerful, worthy and emotional delivery of meaningful content. Connecting all the dots. World needs young leaders, speakers and pathbreaker like you. Keep doing good job. Impressed!!
The ironic thing is North Americans are a lot diverse in todays society... :P
all i was focused  on was her beauty  😂😘😘😘
Hers is a great story of inspiration to be admired, but I can&#39;t stop thinking about how f-king hot she is hmm... ; )<br>&quot;LETS BE HUMANISTS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE.&quot; (Hurray for the fall of religion is at hand!)
Wow, that good
very thankuuuuuuuuuuu mam, <br>Yours words have inspired me and lot of others also to never let the spirit down due to being different
beauty
amazing
It wasn&#39;t deep enough and nothing new ,Ill I thought she wanted to be part of American dream .
i like the way she says venezuela ))
Nobody&#39;s perfect , we all have those imperfections that make each of us Special and  unique , we should love these traits  in each other , and accept them as they are , accept our humanity &lt;3
it&#39;s  one most problem turn up nowadays
wonderful
dear Mariana,<br>Difference means: Do No Harm 🌻<br>take for instance journalism; fake news is harmful, therefore:<br>Do No Harm 🌻<br><br>respectfully,

Que charla tan hermosa. Muchas gracias por compartirla Mariana. Saludos desde Colombia!
perfect woman
being able to reimagine yourself beyond what other people say - that is the toughest task of all. But also the most beautiful. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=925">15:25</a>)

Its simply about respecting others, very inspiring talks, thanks :)
Wonderful, excelente.
She&#39;s a very beautiful woman! A beauty with brain!
She doesn&#39;t look THAT different from people who live in Minnesota...<br>There are black and Asian people there anyway.
I guess no one here knows where is (not even what is) Bahrain :) It is ok we&#39;re to small for you to notice &lt;3
Oh my. She is so amazing. How touching and direct her speech. Amazing choice of words, tone of voice. Such a great topic, good way of talking about it. Amazing speech.
Very jnformative ! Thanks !
Amazing!!!!
&quot; I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death to defend your right to say it.&quot; Did Voltaire actually say  this?
She&#39;s amazing
she is hot
Hahahaha, &quot;donkey or a canoe&quot; - of course they were being playful. Kids are the best.
great
she&#39;s beautiful.
middle East belly dance is a stereotype.
LATINO......... UMM
Believe in Respect 🙌🙏<br>This is what first taught in my Country India :-) I am a proud one here
I feel bad for Fatima :(

so cool
Thank for your share! You also are very beautiful :)
She is beautiful!
Good idea
Wow soo touching. Thanks.
I am from Bahrain and this is inspiring!
Thank you! :3
I think that the speaker misunderstands the problem illegal immigration poses to a country. Heck if the USA opened its boarders to everyone, a billion people would arrive there tomorrow.  She is very naive for a journalist. A country has to screen immigrants for its own protection. That is basic common sense!! Then to draw a relationship between illegal immigration and the value of being different is absurd ! Typical journalist taking two unrelated fact to present a case which has no substance. I suggest she study ecology to get a better understanding of why being different is vital.
love this ted talk. She´s so smart and self-confidence. She knows how to talk and how to explain her life. This girl is so inspire!!
Great words
Really nice speech and you know Spanish
Really What a power full talk it&#39;s awesome keep update next video<br>great
I d love to talk in this programme, sounds cool
Understanding the differences is the key to live with others with great harmony and care
&quot;ReImagine yourself beyond what other people see&quot; - I will never forget this line. thanks :)
为什么最好的资讯都没有中文翻译？这算是资讯封锁吗？
too much talking and nothing to say<br>you are so cute...but doesn&#39;t make it you better
A bundle of thanks from your great speech about how makes ourselves special
Good encouraging.
Very inspiring talk! Thanks for sharing! 💖
Me ha encantado, es de esos TED TALKS que necesitas volver a ver una y otra vez cada cierto tiempo. Gracias Mariana<br>I loved it, its one of those TED TALKS you need to come back to once in while. Thank you MARIANA.
I like her dad...props to him for allowing his kids to experience different cultures and appreciate life...you are very lucky Mariana for the opportunity, glad you did something ab it.
NICE TALK
Amazing Talk from an Amazing Journalist!!<br><br>Thumbs up Mariana 👍
I love you
Very Good. Thank you so much, Mariana.
she is beautiful clear in voice and confident in journalism
She&#39;s hot
Proud to hear a Venezuelan telling this story. Most of us have moved to another country and felt rejected for this differences. Hopefully one day we will start embracing all of these characteristics , that is what makes us unique.
you are very strong girl &amp; inspiration ❤
Beautiful
My heart felt good after listen to you...actually much better...keep going...takecare <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mariana">#mariana</a>
good words. good story. good example. good speech. good looks. It was the best combination of these.
good words. good story. good example. good speech. good looks. It was the best combination of these.
la la
wonderful pep talk..!!
She&#39;s so boring, so déjà vu. But her ass compensates that.
you are a good speaker,, and you are the good example to new genenration
You came here (legally). They did not. They all have to go. It has nothing to do with hate. End of story.
....This TEDx bring dumb people to talk about subjects known to everybody
Wow! Nice talk! Actually I have been thinking these days of what made me special. But I didn&#39;t know. I couldn&#39;t  find the answer. I don&#39;t know what to do, but through this talk, I realize that just being a human, means to me a lot. We are different. And that&#39;s the way we are!
I really admire her for her powerful voice about her country in the media in Spanish and English. Venezuela used to be a very rich country where a lot of rich Venezuelans like &quot;Mariana Atencio&quot; had the access to study abroad at an early age Wow! 7 years old! She isn&#39;t like many other immigrants who have gone to America with a student Visa for the first time to study English or just college or master...she is so lucky that on top of being rich she got a scholarship for her master :)  She learned English at a very early age. That&#39;s why she is so fluent with her speech on the TV Network or TEDx talk.  I&#39;ll congratulate her for being confident, and for being able to transition from a Spanish Network to English in just a little time since her English is so good with a slightly acceptable accent. She is also WHITE ...indeed she is so special! I heard that in many countries in South America are VERY racist with people with DARK skin even worse than in the USA. I acknowledge the confidence of Misses Atencio, proud and confident South American. Since many women from Centro-America lack of confidence in the US. HIGH FIVE!  Smart and born on silver spoon!!!!! Lucky girl!!! She is not like the typical latina like white Shakira, Sofia Vergara or the Spaniard Penelope Cruz who have broken English or strong accents! with many voice coaches LOL, but WHITE like Atencio....the only latina who claims to be LATINA  and proud of her heritage is Zoe Saldana...but she was born in USA...but she has a broken SPANISH!
great i liked so much
Beauty &amp; Brains!
This speech was all over the place and then finishes with &quot;We are all human&quot;. You moved to the States and........ why is this a TED talks?
Your English is awesome though, beautiful accent.
Very nice and interesting  speech. Thank you
Mariana, the way you delivered your story is so inspiring.. I must say that if anyone listens to it from heart, they will change the way they treat immigrants and people of different races, colors or religion.. The Human Race is above all. True..
She&#39;s hot
wow !!! simply love this video
Strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck.
it is a very nice speech.you made me feel special and you also helped me to lose my stage fright and i learned a lot about this world that i didnt know about earlier.
I would be the  happiest man on this planet if you are mine.
You are so special! I love your beauty and wisdom. You look sexy too!
she is amazing!!!  Valuable speech!
So, what makes you special? <br><br>Let me know what you would write down on that piece of paper? <br><br>Me: I always try to be the best version of myself, learn something about anything and being more wide every day.
You should tell those Berkeley students about your Voltaire quote. Nice talk but there&#39;s reality! Not realistic to allow EVERY HUMAN in the U.S. and still live your dream. WAKE UP!
Amazing!  Thank you so much! !!!!
excellent talk.
Wow! awesome... its awesome being Human and the way you&#39;ve spoken ..  Hrudayapurvaka namaskaralu Meeku (in Telugu lang)
Don&#39;t let what makes you different define you, but let what makes you different define you b/c it makes you special, and successful, and it doesn&#39;t matter what makes you different, and by the way I&#39;m super hot and can&#39;t imagine how that opened doors into television...
Who said, Obama = no more racism? Minnesotans look at kids with brown hair and eyes as if they&#39;re space aliens? Obama deported people like crazy. Oh no, some kids thought you didn&#39;t know what a hamburger is; TRAUMATIZED. Pfft. Likely. <br><br>This is silly, but she&#39;s super hot, so no one will call her on it.
Thanks for delivering such a profound speech
fabulous talk. It changed me I don&#39;t know which words I can use to describe what I felt after I finished this talk. Thank you so much Mariana Atencio .
What a beautiful speech! 💖
how old is she
great talk and great personality...you really made for something special...
I am a sucker for beautiful women and their intellect.
nice and gud  topic :))
there is a magic in her speech i really enjoyed watching this video and i see myself now special cause  no one can denay this  truth every one of us is skillful and talented he is just waiting for the right moment to define himself and show his abilities
Awesome. Loved it. I wrote on piece of paper &quot;My Brain&quot;, lol. What did you write?
From the thumbnail I thought this was Sky from Marvel&#39;s S.H.I.E.L.D. &quot;What it means to be special and all&quot;
&quot;Giving everything FOR this country&quot; and &quot;Giving everything TO GET TO this country&quot; are not the same thing.
a beatiful speaker with beautiful ideas.
One of the best &amp; inspiring stories I&#39;ve seen! Thank you!!!
I like English language
Just when I thought this would be inspirational, she decided to go the partisan political route to make a point. She took the air out of the balloon.
her chin and nose are just perfect.
Before we have hierarquical positions in any &quot;organizations&quot; we are Professionals and before Professionals we are Human Beings!
I admit i opened this first because she look beautiful. But  the talk is worth-fully to listen to  :)
dat body. DEFINITELY not american. God bless.
The Fantastic Motivational talk
You are beautiful
the key is to have confidence in oneself. Difference with others is our unique way which can make us outstanding in the world.
don&#39;t tell it to trump. he will send you back to Mexico.
Blessings be unto you lady and those of your kind.
So... If people who are discriminated by others around can&#39;t have the sense of belonging, how can he/she identify himself/herself as &quot;special&quot; without negative thoughts, such as desperation, inferiority, even some radical thoughts?
Different is a chance to know each other, not to ignore each other :)
thank you
Amazing talk! Congratulations Mariana! Que viva Venezuela.
I like
do you americans actualy use the term &#39;ilegal aliens&#39;?!? if so wtf
it&#39;s so great!!
She expects everyone to act like her boyfriend. Who will not judge her but rather say, I love your imperfections. You are imperfectly perfect.
Great talk...a source of inspiration
I liked
worthy to be watched n be inspired..... awesome
It is one of the most inspiring and touching speech I have ever listened to. Thank you so much!
i am seeing you as next president of USA
Mariana ,you are good  speaker  thank  you.
Thank you, Mariana, for reminding me of the differences that make us greater as individuals, a country and world. I dream of a culture in which you and your sister don&#39;t need to be rejected or be so successful to be valued. I travel the world and the people who touch me the most are kind and warm-hearted people who accept me and others. They don&#39;t have your career or education, but show me how limited &quot;success&quot; is when it does not extend to the human warmth to care for human beings and be kind. I&#39;m in Thailand as I write this and am regularly blessed by the presence of people who seem to have less in western metrics, but who give me a quality of heart-centered kindness that I value so much more than my own money and education. I appreciate your message and the tears I cried as I imagined your journey to fit into America, with it&#39;s unique positives and negatives. I find so much of what was missing for me in Western culture abroad, and believe that we have so much to learn from one another.
Inspire
Ok look, this is not real life. We all have our own prejudices and that&#39;s ok. We don&#39;t have to be completely inclusive or perfectly accepting of everyone. Life is full of choices and we should respect everyone, but this whole talk is unrealistic and part of the utopian illusion that far too many people think exists.
You&#39;re right... we all lived same experiences more or less
Your just amazing
What u spoke about is so strong and important, that&#39;s unusual to listen at it! In particular about what makes all of us so special!Beautiful words
Mariana you look beauty and ur speak also so if you make me a call obviously I will be lucky person . This is my number +8801727202081
Excelente Mariana. Very proud you are Venezuelan 💛💙💛🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪
What a load of crap.
her voice is so beautiful and her talk inspires me very much because my classmates see me a misfit people. I feel so lonely and sometimes wanna go away. Thanks to this, I know I must respect myself more. Thank you for wonderful speech
Please give me the transcript of this video. Thank you!
do you know what&#39;s her name ?<br>how old are you ?<br>where is she from ?<br>what do you do ?<br>is she married ?
I am very different and proud :3
Excellent talk
Wow good thing I watched this video by myself you had me crying 😭 very inspiring and this world could use more or a lot people like you...
Marina, good delivery. She knows what she is talking. very communicative. Highly impressive. She chooses the right words to express her feelings. Great!
life can be change in split second. Sometimes i forget about this.
she&#39;s an amazing person 😪💞
What a story mark!
Thanks
What she is saying can be summarized in a few words :     show respect to others, whoever they are, poor or rich, colored or non-colored, handicapped or healthy, old or young. The best among you is the one who is most humble, and the worst among you is the one who always think, he or she is better than others.
Thank you SO much ! I loved your speech !!
wow I almost cried,.. so inspiring
My God shes soooooooo pretty !!!! 💖💖💖💖💖💖
The only truth  i  see is your beyond my mind Beauty ,

WHAT MAKES YOU SPECIAL?? BY NOT BEING AN ILLEGAL AND VIOLATING THE LAWS OF YOUR COUNTRY AND ANY OTHER COUNTRY!
hello everybody! i need to practice speaking Eglish. Is there anyone can help me?
very poweful ad good,I hate all racists all over the world
Bravo Yeah YEAh!It is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=1412">23:32</a> pm now and I&#39;m so Powerful and Energetic to hear you talking!What an Influential speech!
Very Powerful and listenable talk. Watched it more than dozen times and still want to watch it over and over .......
my big penus
Very motivating !
celebrate diversity!!
Being Humanists!! Embracing the imperfections. The consistency in inculcating these will definately make a  difference.
This isn&#39;t very helpful to talentless people without anything of worth to distinguish them. Then again, nothing is.
hola Mariana saludos desde chile ¡¡¡
I am special because my mom loves me and that&#39;s all what matters
&quot;Nothing&quot;<br>THE END<br>:)<br>P.S. I&#39;m only commending on the title. I haven&#39;t watched the video ;)
Yes, she is special. I would be too if my parents could afford to send me to as many camps as her parents did in USA during my childhood. It is easy to see different places, travel the world , and get special experiences when its paid by your rich parents .
what happen this is girl become my wife.
Shit ,     I swear I kept trying to listen to her talk that seems full of love , but her beauty distracted me continuously to woooooh
such powerful talk
Omg she is so hot *.^
she talks about embracing differences, but the message I got was to learn that we are in fact all the same. Everyone is unique, and therefore everyone is the same, no less and no more than the others. Conflicts happen when we view others differently, or when we r viewed differently. So, embrace similarities instead, and the world will be so much better.
she so good and she speak so clearly
It is an interesting speeh

Fallout makes me S.P.E.C.I.A.L....
leave it what she say... but she is beauty queen...😂😂
thank you for your talk, very inspired... love you so much, my girl
If you&#39;re from Venezuela and you mention Trump and fail to mention Hugo Chavez.....you might be a libtard propagandist.
what makes you special? nothing. nothing except that which other people think makes you special.
Absolutely inspiring talk! Thanks for sharing this with us! It&#39;s just impossible to watch this and stay the same...
ass
Awesome talk !
I&#39;m touched!
wow! What a presence and what a message! The message is so simple yet so profound! I am of Indian descent who has lived around the world and India celebrates unity in diversity! Some thing I have grown up with! Her message is too dear to my heart!
Lose your vocal fry.
thank u for inspired talk
Absolutely incredible. Amazing delivery and take home message.
&quot;I&#39;m different too!&quot; Has been my motto for almost two years, and Marian gave it more meaning in this video!

Great ,,,bravo Mariana .....
One of the greatest things she has it that her parents support her to travel.. in our middle east we&#39;re facing lots of restrictions start with parents deny and end with the high cost of travel.. proud of you Mariana and one day I&#39;ll tell all Syrian&#39;s stories and painful to the whole world.

You&#39;re beautiful, really really inspiring talk! thanks alot.
good
I world like your Presentation.
So fine
Great talk well mannered and delivered the message which the superior personell should notice ....<br><br>All the very best wishes for expressing about global and regional aspect. ..<br><br>For example <br>if any individual so wrong penalty them and identify but keep humanity with all nationals.
she  is amazing
As a Muslim Indian girl with vitiligo this has really inspired me, Thanks a lott.
This is a nice attempt. But, historically, biologically, socially and medically Black people have been seen as NOT human. Thus, making your claims unattainable and unrealistic in this world. Sad but true. This video would be easier for every other person in the world nut blacks are unfortunately the ultimate bottom. This is not meant for us. No matter how well you do or think in life, there will always be a system in place to remind you that you are less than. Hence why we have to work harder and are naturally more resilient in these conditions.
i hate makeup
Gave me a great insight!
ONLY when we experience ADVERSITY, we become more understanding of the differences around us.
Very good speech and information sharing video. I listen speeches to get new ideas or information.
u r so hot
Be humanist
awesome speech u r different
I loved the message. Thank you so much! Let&#39;s live our differences
What a story. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, thanks for thinking differently. I really enjoyed your talk!
Good talk... helpful
Beautiful
Great talk.
You are a great person, Mariana.

when she started talking I thought it&#39;s going to be silly but she really had a message to delivere
wow she is so awesome
i love ur self confidance and ur english
Your voice is so fantastic
Really, she is a champ.
thank you so much mariana from middle east
Oh, my  goodness! This speech saved  my day!  👏👏👏👏👏
Excellent address ever listen, could not find words to admire her message her style her confidence and her great command on language
Yesterday I thought about the idea of people having cardboard, and if I have it blank what will I write on it to concisely define myself to others like a shoutout. Im about to write an essay about it, but became hesitant. But it seems we have the same idea somehow. Really, its a powerful message. Thank you for making me feel its good to be different.
Amazing, <br>She knows how to explain her goals well,
I like her confidence as well as pronunciation.
&quot;The single thing everyone of us has in common is being human. So take a stand to defend your race.&quot; WTF???!!!! Defend your race, after all this talking?? So tell me, if you&#39;re a white in UK, how will you defend your race?!
Lidamente dito, lindamente sentido, lindamente amado.
inspired by u .. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
But what happened to Fatima ???
Showw!!
In the world&#39;s of all terror, I may not agree with what you have to say BUT I will fight to death to defend your right to say it&lt;3
The U.S. will take down it&#39;s border wall with Mexico when Mexico takes down it&#39;s border wall with Guatemala.  Borders exist for a reason.
her speech is so fluent ,a good example of great communication skill even though her mother tongue is not english!!!
&quot;Nobody has a claim on the word &#39;normal&#39;.&quot; I wish everyone can see this video!
word&#39;s of wisdom + good looking young one. well done  .
Excelente speech .. un gran ejemplo a seguir, superación y voluntad de hacer la diferencia.. Dios te bendiga .. saludos desde Vzla !!
&lt;3 Sending love. Such an inspirational speech!
it&#39;s a very good talk, that a lot of people should watch...<br><br>I always think, that being different is a special power we all got and that we should be humanist before everything else...but I have never been able to put in words :3! <br><br>thank you for telling, what I always wanted to say:)
thanku so much
I liked it until she mentioned the Trump election....close minded people teaching &quot;respect&quot; to other close minded people and yet we are supposed to eat this because we are the &quot;minority&quot;? No. No-one mentions the undocumented people that live in Europe and get kicked out and sent back to their countries. Who talks about that no one!!! Just shut up and accept the fact that Trump is our president. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!
❤️👍
She talks like she is American, but she is not! So she can&#39;t say &quot;we&quot; should be accepting, &quot;they&quot; should be accepting others speciality!
She is great. God bless her.
love you 😔
very interesting speech 👍👍👍
Wauw!! So special and so inspiring. Big thanks.
you are beautiful inside
Nobody has a claim to the word &quot;Normal&quot; ... finally, someone put it in words for me
I feel inspired.  Very interesting topic!
Thank you Mariana.
Fantastic !!
I speak broken English  -_-
What a talk! Perfect and Unputdownable!! What is different about me makes me successful! Totally inspiring.
Beautiful talk surely from a beautiful Lady. Congrats!!!
this is beautiful, thank you. I&#39;ve always struggling of being different, this give me some courage. One of my fav Ted talk!
mariana for president
What I found interesting was that she didn&#39;t stay in her country to fight for freedom of speech...<br>Next time my house gets dirty..I will go to my neighbours and lecture them about how to keep their place clean....
i love this video so much.
big words...
thank you, i really need that now
awesome speech
Very inspiring..Thanks.🤗
Her speech was very impressing and powerful. When she started talking about her sister and experiences when she was young, I  almost cried. She talked her thoughts exactly in her mind.
great talk! you are inspiration.
what is the poing
liberal self-destroying
This is so inspiring, thank you for making the world a better place!
Well, shoot. I have no idea what makes me different. Nothing significant comes to mind. I think all this is doing, is making me feel boring and not at all special or different, which is a problem I&#39;ve had my whole life. I&#39;m a plain-jane nobody.
wow...Awesome speech!!
&lt;3 &lt;3 what a wonderful talk <b>_</b>
Loved it
latinas are the hottest women in the world
I love her accent&lt;3
Venezuelan beauty! You are so confident.
Great
I just realized that &quot;everyone should listen to stories like this everyday&quot; to make this World better!
Mariana i am Truly speechless! Heart warming Humanity,
You spoke every immigrant&#39;s heart in every country on the face of this earth ! Thank You so much!
Love it

In love with her
I was just beginning to enjoy the talk and then she started to talk about Obama and Trump. Bye Bye Mariana. I hope I did not miss much.
It&#39;s great
Not every muslim girl is shy. There are many muslim girls, who even with their &quot;strict dress code &quot; carry themselves with confidence.
Super!!!
Yes i love it unique and quirky yes we all are different thank God or we would be living as doubles.
TRUMP YOU SHOULD SEE THIS VIDEO MAN
Her sir name sounds like a spell from Harry Potter :D

sorry. i can&#39;t focus on what she said.   she is so hot.  am i the only one?
no vi venir un discurso tan elocuente como el de esta señorita. si tan solo un puñado hubiera como ella este mundo sería otro mundo!
She&#39;s amazing. Excellent talk!
Mariana is awesome
aaaaaaaand  you are hot.
People like Trump will always be there to remind you of being a other and people will also be there to support him. So, Kudos to everyone.
She is on cocaine 100%
thanks ! <br>When we have different people from different regions, different countries, the first thing that we must learn is, of course, the pleasantries. But, for me, I always thought that the best way to learn another country’s language is by learning their way of thinking, their culture, but most of all their humor, and how they understand their humor. Because I think their humor is really based on how they see things. It really depends on their perspective of life. So learning their humor, I think is probably the first step. So in language classes in schools, perhaps one of the first things should be about learning other countries&#39; humor!
I could hear her speach over and over again. Her pronuntiation is just perfect, you can understand every single word she said, so fluent! and english I think it&#39;s not even her native language. Her message it&#39;s also amazing. Congrats!
let&#39;s talk about trump
she definetly speaks like a leader and a rolemodel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5SatbZMAo&amp;t=211">3:31</a>

VENEZUELA REPRESENTANDO YASSSSS MOST GORGEOUS WOMEN ON EARTH and smarttt
Beautiful girl and powerful words. Inspiration. P-E-R-F-E-C-T.
Mariana, you are a fabulously beautiful woman, inside and out! I wish always the best for you. Here are 1 dozen red roses<br> 🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
god ..!! her speech is amazingly powerful..
Truly a beautiful and important talk!
So does she even explain clearly? What is the value to be different? If those people she said are so different? Why cannot they just build their own country better? But escape and becoming refugee, which in another word, coward and losers? Or become ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS! Yes, the reason that eight year old girl&#39;s mother need to leave before she came here illegally!  And you are not special at all, you should appreciate the people in this country who give you the opportunity to shine. Otherwise, you don&#39;t even have your own country anymore! Why suddenly come from a loser country, and not to fight for that country, but escape becoming a word of &quot;Hero?&quot; Before challenging Trump, how about your challenge the president of your motherland! Waste my time, and irrational talk!
I agree with her. Reminds me of fight club.<br><br>Tyler Durden: &quot;Listen up, maggots. You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You&#39;re the same decaying organic matter as everything else.&quot;
She&#39;s hot.
17 minutes talk, 14 seconds substance.
Actually, we need to be simple to be happy. Live our lives and don&#39;t forget those around us. Because nobody knows about your life, how many will endure it?
DNK.
Such an inspirational speech. Thank you Mariana Atencio!
I&#39;m now going to search for women speaking Venezuelan
Loved it!! One of the best Ted Talks!! Gracias Mariana.
Beauty lady
Great talk! I enjoyed every moment of it! We are not different we are all the same with the special and unique traits that help us stand out. Find yours today and capitalize on it.
What a powerful beautiful speech. Imperfections is what makes us different from anybody else and to say that we are in fact one common factor in this world is that yes we are all human beings with different walks in life . Thank you so much for this speech. Now i know that i can embrace being who i am no matter what anybody says. May God bless you and your family. :)
Very powerful  talk. Thanks
such an  inspiration ! one of the best TED Talks (y)
Great speech!
Thank You for a beautiful reminder!
Beautiful we are all Human and we are all differnt! Celebrate that we are special &amp; unique.
Wonderful powerful speech !  Mariana, you made me burst into tears.  it makes me think of this new president so ruthless, sending his  gestapo  to schools to deport 14 year old children.  we are all human beings, we are all connected.    My heart is so torn.
Meh smacks of liberal sentiment. I switch off when they start to paint Trump as an intolerant racist.
Because your family come to this country with legal means while others without knowing their background and skill level can cause a national dangerous.  I bet you feel more comfortable if your friend let their friends to show up in your house than any strangers.
What makes you different and special
very clear and fluent speech of her  experience really brave
Thank you for this powerful talk! Sharing, and weeping a bit, as I am moved by your honest words and powerful vulnerability. Much Love.
It is so great, thank you
What a useful idiot for the left. She is speaking for the very enemy. Before journalism, she better study history and politics.
She is charming
Blessed to have watched this video. I am Indebted.
being human ....super clarity words frm heart  mariana
Cried.
That&#39;s great about her sister.  Almost cried.
Sounds like a B.S story, High school exchange student from Bahrain, no normal Muslim family would ever allow a young girl to live away and even if that were to ever happen tbe girl would not come from a traditional Muslim family. Think about it if a girl leaves her home without a male that girl is disowned by the family and society. So it is better to chose a different character or a Muslim girl with her family here. You are contradicting yourself.
God bless you 1!
Yes, that is what I tried to tell to my classmates, colleagues and family, that first we are human and we all feel the love and pain in the same way. Nobody in this world is coming from other planet.
awesome talk...she is explain story very clear, the right thing when you understand other people with huge &amp; embrecing love no matter you haven&#39;t knew them, its make you different than other.
Kizbop
Whats makes her special? There wasnt depth to the talk...
So she is basically saying that when she was 7, she went to Minnesota and she missed Snapchat and Instagram...<br><br>She lost me right there and what follows doesn&#39;t matter. She must not be more than 14 now except that she doesn&#39;t look like a 14 yr old.
Brilliant.. Brilliant.. Love you.. you Inspired me.. made my day and my year and my life...
So powerful
Up there with the best TedTalks of all time. Inspired!!
by ignoring finances, you miss the boat. <br><br>Illegals are not legals. Legals are not illegals. <br><br>Economics matter.
great talk 👍
FANTASTICA! venezolana encima :) gracias por esta lección de vida, a veces necesitamos que nos lo recuerden porque se nos olvida lo importante de lo esencial de la vida. Great Girl! and from Venezuela as me! thank you very much for the lesson  of life, sometimes we need to be reminded because we forget the important of the live essentials of life.
Applause 👏🏾 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Thanks Mariana.you talk is greatly inspiring and most timely.you rightly stressed about being human and celebrating our imperfections.do post more.
Your Husband must proud of you,
I love your message! Phenomenal video!
Well said.   I have embraced my weird personality a long time ago, since I was 16.  Just decided that if someone is gonna love me, I need to know if they love the real me.  And interesting enough, if someone hated me, they wouldn&#39;t be wrong.  Because I&#39;m me.  Not hiding any of it.  Weird, and will always be, who care, that&#39;s just me.  And I love those whom hate me sometimes, their hate isn&#39;t a reason enough for mine.  Anyway, loved your talk.  It was heart felt.  Simple yet profound.  Best of luck dear.
She&#39;s my soul sister! Couldn&#39;t agree more with everything she said. Unite as humans, stand up and uplift one another. We&#39;re all the same. ❤️❤️❤️
a powerful speech  love it :)
Can we tweet this talk to fucking Trump?
you talk confidently, proudly and differently..!
Sorry but what is there to like in this talk. Nothing different and sounds all made up. Big talks.
wow
Spending my weakend watching such crap! that&#39;s what makes me special.
Alberteacher from Cable Plus TV bilingual Orient says: What makes Ms. Mariana special is her outstanding beauty...inside and out.  Who would close an opportunity door to a bilingual beauty like her...she would stand out anywhere she goes.... A venezuelan who made her mind up to be successful....journalist, outspoken. I, speechless paid attention to every single world she spoke in this her lecture about what makes me special.
great video, thanks for sharing.
putting myself to the other&#39;s shoes &lt; this is how empathy works and gradually reducing prejudice on other people who is different
I like this kind of videos and she speak really clearly thanks a lot....
Excellent talk, espcially the imploing to be curious about what is on other peoples&#39; cards.
I do not agree with what you have to say, but I&#39;ll defend to the death your right to say it.

speaking defferent language doesn&#39;t means that person is  terrorist let say she/he learn different so they  never become ignorance.<br>
Mariana, you are good speaker. thank you
Well done Mariana. Her speech is inspiring. One more special thing is that she looks like a Hollywood actor 👍
Beautiful speech!

Powerful words &amp; great way of sharing or explaining her experience to the world.
Wonderful video.

Was enjoying it, then she said: &quot;the human race&quot;... ugh ignorant bullshit. There is no such thing as the human race as humans are a species.
I love you,,

Ur talk has inspired me and made me stronger. Thank u!!  (　＾∇＾)
What a powerful talk. She is very clear in her thoughts so the words are coming out like a cascade. I salute this brave lady and she is an inpiration and example to others. Certainly beauty is an added value to a speaker to easily attract the croud and she has got it.

Powerful words, pure inspiration. Thank you so much for that Mariana. From Venezuela to the world!
I love the video! Well done girl for the achievement and for delivering such a profound speech.
