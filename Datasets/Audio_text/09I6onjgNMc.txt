thought this is going to be a street fight God damn right it is the final hand in hand add discussion with James the main thing that he wanted to have a really cool weapons fight with metal clash and and Klang together you're messing with the guy that's going to finish business in Dom's mind he wanted to destroy it a sense of danger as well this movie is full of testosterone and I think the only way to get down and dirty it's let's do this I'm always peace to be one notch better than the last play the scenes where we are intense with one another we're not the most enjoyable scenes on the sun because Ralph and it's just super fun to watch
