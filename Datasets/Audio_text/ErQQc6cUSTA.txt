so this is a big package you can tell a very elaborate super workstation / gaming computer cancel look at this that is I don't even know how you etch that in that's my face in case you're wondering and it's like laser and Big O this is from origin PC it's two boxes apparently inside of this box is a gaming computer slash Xbox slash PlayStation / Nintendo switch in one Kirk am I correct on this is that the package deal all in one place so you get the best of all worlds one for everything call it the Big O I'm excited this is different I've never looked at anything like this before here we go oh boy it's a whole process here it's a process important high performance I don't even know how will fit all those things into one PC case but I guess if you got a big enough PC case when you buy like a high-end car they put like this rap on it when you go to collect it it's kind of like a high-end vehicle right here oh man okay this is insane what that's way better than I expected it's crazy that each thing identified chicken fluid the PlayStation with PlayStation looking fluid Xbox PS4 HDMI out for a wired controller okay it's a custom stuff right here really that's all you would need for the person who has everything you put this in the game room the switch is it going to slide in here and talk you see the the USB type-c connector you can freely remove an insert a Nintendo switch that's HDMI switcher box on the front you can switch it to remote control so you never need to change the TV's input TV stays HDMI 1 the PC runs all the liquid cooling pumps for the entire system including the liquid cooling on the consoles I need my expectations this everybody who worked on it check it out man we call it the Big O this 2019 edition of the big old combines Xbox One X a PlayStation 4 Pro a Nintendo switch and an extremely high end gaming PC all into our Flagship Genesis desk sassy the big old is a testament to our hard work and creativity when it comes to PC Building we're proud to share it with you and your team to show the world you get access to your power switch type c other USB input and this is oh is the switch okay that makes sense and you're going to slide this guy in and void call RGB gaming headset in here PlayStation controller you're going to need that connect your joy cons in there that one Xbox One X it's got to be blacked out it's got to match the case of course the premium headset stand with 7.1 surround so this goes with the void Pro headset as you can see that's what it looks like dot the M65 RGB Elite gaming mouse this is a mouse mat with a built-in USB pass-through Corsa gaming mouse pad obviously k95 be platinum as you can see RGB colors in the back mechanical keyboard MX Cherry MX switches this thing is made out of craft grade anodized brushed aluminum and I can tell from the weight right now I think serious Okay so we've got it all set up now it's hooked up and there's a couple different ways that you can utilize this the way it's going right now is that all the systems the PlayStation Xbox and the Nintendo switch which is docked in the front are all heading via HDMI into this HDMI switcher on the front right here is the remote control to go with it now that is going to have its own independent HDMI output which is going to one of the inputs on monitor right here that we selected that's the ultra-wide latest 38 inch 3840 resolution but most interestingly one millisecond of response time is from LG a link in the description for gaming you're going to want a fast response time in to take advantage of having like a $3,000 plus graphics card obviously so Kirk Camila it looks beautiful he's he's look at the responsiveness look at the FPS it's OverWatch he's terminating the phones he's even playing with Dave 2D I think right now so how about that for a shout-out so input one would essentially be all consoles input to could then be your PC and the reason I think this makes sense is because the consoles themselves are going to put likely a different resolution than what the PC is capable of as you can tell here this is an unusual aspect ratio when is display with PC gaming that's no issue just map it out accordingly consoles on the other hand not really doing the Exotic resolutions so you're going to have black bars when you switch over to Playstation Xbox or Nintendo switch so call into the same HDMI switcher since they're going to be pumping out the same resolution to begin with the other potential implementation is more if you plan on being a game streamer and you want to stream games not just from the PC but also from all of the consoles then what you're going to want to do is utilize the game capture card which is in here capable of 4K 60 frames is that all you would do on the same input on the PC input you would just launched into the capture card and maximize you'd be able to play with your various controllers so you wouldn't need to utilize another input on the monitor now the last play you could send the PC output to a monitor like this one which can really take advantage of the PCS capabilities then you could end the HDMI output from the switcher to like a TV which you also have in the setup the singular HDMI output from this HDMI switcher to the TV and keep the PC active on the Monitor and then just flip between the two all coming off of single box something cool I noticed on the back of the device this hard wire this hard line ethernet connection is coming from the Xbox you obviously want to have a wired connection to the motherboard of the PC then you could share that connection via this ethernet cable which is pre-installed and connected to the Xbox so the Xbox hypothetically would have a more reliable connection so anyway okay Kirk play PC he's playing right now as far as he's concerned right now it's a regular typical PC gaming type of scenario now input on a monitor so he'll just reach over switch the input and what you'll see is it'll go right into Nintendo but then he's like you know I want to play that new Spider-Man which I have on the PlayStation and then you simply use this controller to switch the in so I just hit number three now he picks up the PlayStation controller and also an Amazing Spider-Man wish play I've been playing and kind of enjoying in fact open World style navigate around next website combos of course since it's also an Xbox in here I could just simply hit number one switcher he could pick up the Xbox controller and now he's got the Xbox love as well so he's easy Ultimate Gamer status right now no matter where his friends happen to play he just jumps into that spot and he's doing it all from one box and probably post seamless implementation I've personally seen the cool thing is if I take the switch for example is ready to go still that baby just pops out and now you're taking the Yoshi on the go you can slide the joy-con in look at this guy I mean who's better than him he's ready he's ready play a game in any situation is just really cool it's really ambitious the execution unbelievable I think origin knocked it out of the park it's called the big oh it's a custom thing as far as I know it's a one-of-a-kind thing I just think it's amazing
