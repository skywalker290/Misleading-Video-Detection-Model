can I just start by saying it's so good to see you any part of the world India here in Melbourne anyway always good to see you thank you play nice to see you too thank you thank you Indian film festival you know the local papers I don't know if you're aware play local papers have said that there are fans of yours that have made plans that are booking themselves to be here this weekend from all of the region because I came here many years ago when I play supposed to do and getting my two bits about Cinema I find it awkward but 10 years ago so I said I have to come and yes I'd like to see all the people here and I hope people from all over come so I can meet them at the screenings or wherever the chances do you have stop making chicken about 50 days I have memories of the hotel we are staying in Lincoln and I went very clear I actually used to have so much time on my hand and I started writing my book here and and the girls because you know they were how do I say I want to non-actors but they were absolutely mint fresh it was really exciting being with them it's really exciting being with them all these young boys and girls and most of the people were first second timer for people and I'm very quiet and greatest Indian time so I just used to roam the streets in the evening not much to do get back into the room and sit down my new laptop and right so I have some very fond memories plus the fact that I think Melbourne is turn on Sporting Community it has a whole Community where people like to play sports and courage is that so that was very nice right here biggest stadium receiving an honorary degree from the from Latrobe University tomorrow is that is that is that important thing is that a big deal do you know whenever you get doctorates assumption is it is being given for having worked hard in the field that you are a professional yes and and hopefully a part of it can be imparted to others said it's a great feeling I don't know how to play some amazing universities in education system in Latrobe itself so if a girl can come here every year and get an educational facility which per I think for me that that was the happiest part of the doctor and of course I'll get a certificate which off spend time with the family to travel that's what the last few months have been you haven't made another movie since the last release how is this time been sort of and then that kind of fell through and I just thought normally when I'm doing a film I have worked out the next film and somehow I just didn't work out one and suddenly I just don't have any filmmakers offering films do that's not true it's not even a big deal I think initially tell me when I go into town hall and everybody's writing oh it's a birthday be announced so good speculating now yeah and and in the station I think I've done more films than I've ever done in my life and I was actually doing them right now open action film then I want to do a fun film so I don't know I'm not giving it to her I'm okay actually does it help you decide what you want to do next and what does it do I don't think so I think I'm going to make the same mistakes I've made the last few years and I think it's not at all going to teach me anything different it won't give me any perspective I mean I'll be honest you know if I got perspective if I was able to differentiate between good and if I could somewhere realize what I actually should be doing to get it right I think it'll get so boring it'll be like a true it'll be nonsense of Discovery I'm not even discovering that comes into my heart I've always been like this don't believe it because you know you reach a certain status and people think what they must be a lot of thought going into this and it was replying this I've never planned it I'm just happy that I have time to come to Melbourne go down and spend some time with my daughter in New York go to Trinidad and Tobago watch some cricket and it's not like I'm holding I'm really working hard but I'm working a lot of stories and films to make for production I don't know I can just be in my shots with my hair standing just lying on the road please I don't want to do anything I'm I think the do people in this world was so restlessly peaceful as I am okay I'm the most restlessly peaceful man in the world have huge piece huge patience and huge restlessness so if I come into play second grade Martin Luther King acting for for a few months but you've been very active and very busy as a producer because you had the company had bad luck of course which was a success and you'll have now part of blood which is a Netflix series which will go on soon and you've just announced that you're making money Heist if I would love to do it if there is something that excites me 52 minutes small screen anymore like I just saw Irishman is a 200 million Martin Scorsese get the needle and Al Pacino together and it's going to come on Netflix so how does that make it so I think it's really cool man if you can see it and like it is very exciting it's very exciting so I don't think that really makes a difference now I mean what would be happening in India they can release the film on Friday and Monday they will put on of a film should be judged just by the fact that it's going to come on Netflix opening what do you think it is about our Cinema that is unique to our Cinema that speaks the universal language and first part I will tell you what actually is the honest truth person in the world so you are going to Outlast in Hollywood not taking I mean there's a danger now but I think we don't ask Cinema is kind of stood the test of time uniquely local all the other films you know like like European Cinema I should not a lot of countries which are great Cinema filmmakers have suddenly gone down because Hollywood has taken and they're just left because ours is extremely unique so even if Marvel Comics does well here Iron Man singing Lungi Dance Lungi Dance Lungi Dance it's not going to happen so I think the uniqueness apart from the songs makes it very relevant to Indian and again if you're 1.3 billion people add relevance holds a lot more water than if you were just only 25 million people so I think our Cinema is unique it spreads out because we are all over the place plus even if I wasn't an Indian I think just the uniqueness is very attractive and I think em we are over soaked with emotion and that's something that is losing according to think and feel for them Indian films are they take you by the Scruff of the neck as a cry with us laugh with us fall with us jokes Punch and Judy theatrical I think it has a certain point in time wants to have a good cry tell me now that you've been spending song and have more time to spend with them being passed on not at all good who's going to win the The Lion King voices because it was fine you don't have to live with each other aspect of film that he can go and learn so the other day I met him so I told him go and camera with amazing time together at 8:00 just sit there and jam and used to play the guitar he's going to get in a half of physical and then additional and she wants to act she's right now at the French Festival in Edinburgh so she's doing Theater Chicago I think the most important part of them growing up is that I should not impose my ideas on them because minus are set mine have no kind of nearly nearly been fully cultivated so you know if it's cultivated it's already there then I'm here to give my Human Service to Indian film industry with my cultivated amazing talent why play duplicated to them let them learn something I think it's very important at least I believe that old fashioned but I think it's very important for every actor and actress every filmmaker and Storyteller every person who is to start giving back something to the film industry bring something new to it so for example if if today you are starting a new show it should have you already done what you have now you know your you know you know your phone you know how to know if filmmakers my kids in case they wish to come in they have to bring something new they can't live off just go bring me something radical and weird and strange and wrong maybe but it should be newer than what I've been able to get I'm thinking is to train Abraham to be mad like me I think Aaron and Savannah very very sensible and they should not I'll teach him how to be the king resume timer so you know can you read everything critical appraisal of them if he gives it 4 1/2 hours and I'm going to take on to Anderson
