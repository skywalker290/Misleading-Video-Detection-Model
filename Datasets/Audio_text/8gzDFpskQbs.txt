how's it going bro my name is PewDiePie epic gamer here today we're playing a game we're going to figure out which one of these Gamers it's the actual fake game that's right I generally think I'm good at this I can tell whenever I'm talking to people they know gaming and they're like oh yeah no I'm gamer too I'm totally like we're just the same no you're not don't even try I love watching my brother play bada then you're not a gamer oh I love playing on my phone that you're not a gamer oh I love playing on my Xbox not a gamer oh I love speedrun not a gamer just pathetic also I said this before but I remember back in my day when I was young I that's what it was like in Sweden we had to hide I was a minority I was that let me finish sentence I was a minority of people play video games but we're still cool yeah I'll call myself cool I don't care if that sounds cringe because there was the genuine people that were just like nerds and then there was this minority of the finest specimen I should stop talking all right the point is I want so you can run now people are faking being Gamers to pretend pathetic anyway start the video let's go this is Jubilee Gamers versus one fake gamer and we can play along I'm so excited what is that this is tag hanging out all right this guy is is there a gamer because he has an unfunny shirt the one thing Gamers love it's on funny shirts I know a couple people watching this right now and they're looking like a God damn it all right he's right I just want to see if I can spot a Game of Thrones What so you're highly incentivize to we do a little like a research and stuff cuz do they know what topic they're going to pretend to be surely they do they're going to be like you might want to like what was some ideas interesting that's some gamer but I trust you apple sauce let's gauge the reaction of the other people here look at that guy see he's like that's some Windows shut down face he has no idea he's either a terrible gamer or I'm not a gamer at all we have nothing happening here this guy just looks confused she's definitely a gamer because she's trying really hard to prove that 3000 if he's not a game or he's a weirdo what's up call Latoya absolute unit with a picture of a buffet at 357 play Pokemon to darkest dungeon like anything so what happens now so this is followers vote so they think him and then oh really people think him interesting he gets fan two on brides and Jessica it's between Jessica and Grace it's going to get 30 seconds to give a case for themselves for 30 seconds to give a case for themselves what is this okay so can you play Slender Man game I know about the blue and the blue and the red truck yeah those what the fuck that's what you got out of that game they got trucks I rest my case what oh you know what you know what's a great way to figure out if someone's a fake gamer asked like rate your favorite Dark Souls games or just Souls games in general and see what what do they do and if you pick Dark Souls 2 at the top you just throw them out of there just like punch them in the face that's what I would do it she's very good when it comes to like being under pressure what a lot of farming oh yeah so the point of the game understand turrets okay all right she did redeem herself a little bit at the end fair fair all right I believe this guy because anyone that has Kingdom Hearts as their favorite game cannot shut the fuck up about it so I believe him he's 100% clear what does my friends from another game we're all transitioning over to league and then ever since then I've just been playing that with my girlfriend and her cousins this guy is a gamer and has a girlfriend my name is Pokemon Emerald like I've been playing Emerald since I was a little kid I remember I can't really see this guy I'm like video games I don't really have time for that I just like to read a nice book I can't really picture that's not even a game that's a TV show you dumbass that's a cool TV show Dome game Pokemon it took him 7 years to beat battle dome the Frantic pinball battle game respect that I respect that pulled up the camera immediately and started taking pictures and posting it everywhere just huge moment right there what's my favorite game with probably be Paper Mario the very first time I saw the game My Brother played it and I loved it and my favorite Paper Mario is also a fair like that's another Kingdom Hearts type of game that people grew up on so I believe that that's her favorite my favorite game is until dawn which we started playing in college my friend Bri was playing it and started playing it in college his favorite game is until dawn all right if he's a gamer he's got no respect for me it's a good game don't get me wrong but favorite game absolutely absolutely not that's disgusting no gamer respect at all favorite game until dawn see I think this is but I'm good at judging people from their tasting video games if you play it you can't even count you can't even count I don't see anyone playing until would you can't even count I'm smelling bush put a cross reference Time OK Google I don't know that I don't remember that but my that is terrible but I do remember some very big jumpscares in the game does that save me oh God I wish people always suspect it's me for some reason people suspect I do bad things I know who the main character is this the guy from robot so he doesn't die first I mean if it's his favorite game and he's played a countless times he I know that that's pretty smart of her to ask I think can't you change who's the first person to die isn't that up to you isn't that the point of the game Veyron Veronica Veronica until dawn dude there's no Veronica there's no Veronica what is the name of the monster in the game well I can tell you what it's like a bad cre can you handle any confrontation here like this girl who's clearly like way more Alpha than all of them I did try to like button like hey let's move it but it was it was like a wall look it up I promise you there's a Veronica I guess like if I was there I wouldn't be able to tell ya play Veronica I want to see my mind went blank when she asked me about like oh like about a character or something like I couldn't think of the actors and actresses and I said Veronica there's no there's no actor called Veronica either just a little shred of thought of me thinking you know what don't do that don't make that women are not like women should not be allowed to make play hair brown eyes she's like the one he's like oh like she's like Google who is the Asian girl in until dawn all right let's see it yet Nicole hey Google is Veronica like I don't know why you're trying what are gaming metaphor right here the whole Squad standing behind a woman calling out a fake gamer that's the thing I would never oh she never had a Game Boy Advance oh oh you know what it's probably her what OK Google you can stop playing now yes not even know what role do you usually Play and play Champions League results can you play Sona and Annie what is the last game Humble Bundle play get like a bundle of games like every month play the Spire I got that one wait what they voted her out are you kidding me these guys vote her out after this clean hey let's see who it is it's play the guy that looks like a school the guy on the light I they voted her out after she discovered him can I hear I guess next time learn the names of characters better yeah that should not have been that hard can you pick a game like that will you literally
