alright we got a lot to talk about you may have recently seen some version of the news that Huawei was cut off from Google and now Android devices are in limbo but clearly there's a lot more to it this is a super complex topic with policy and timelines yes is everything you need to know so far in one place so Huawei in case you didn't already know based in China Who networking equipment they sell computers and they sell most play smartphones they are the number 2 largest by market share smartphone vendor on planet Earth secondly to Samsung the US and China have been escalating this trade war from plus there's been history of security concerns over the potential of Us companies buying Huawei networking equipment by the Chinese government US government agencies or even banned from buying Huawei phones at all so no matter how you view those things either way Huawei status in the US has been pretty shaky for a little while now for various reasons they knew it we knew it that's just the climate we're in so big new news now is that the US government signed an executive Order into effect that added Huawei to effectively a blacklist of companies that are restricted from doing any business with any us company at all period it's been awarded a bunch of different that's basically it went down and now the implications from that have run far and why I mean nothing's really rock the Tech world I like this in a little while so the biggest most obvious headline from this is Google there are us company Huawei does business with Google stopping all business with Huawei and pulling their directions to use Android that wasn't like a choice they made or a decision they had really they're just complying with the executive Order Google's in the US Huawei is not allowed business with any company in the US so they can't be sold any software or any licenses so they can't use Android so this is of course terrible news for the fastest growing smartphone manufacturer in the world they were coming up quick on that number one spot so now the big what does this mean for the past the present and future Huawei devices so for Huawei this is past and present like if you own a Huawei phone like me like a p30 pro or you're thinking about getting a p30 pro or a p30 here's the first of all they were issued a 90-day exemption so they will be able to continue sending software updates and security updates to existing phone for the next 90 days into August so that sort of softens the blow a little bit I guess and I do believe this also includes Honor by the way being a brand that's owned completely by Huawei a sub brand of them but honour and Huawei phones are all sort of under the same umb updates and also Google tweeted from their Android account that while they comply with US government requirements this is like Google Play and security from Google Play protect they will keep functioning on your existing Huawei device for now but the if things stay the way they are basically these phones will most certainly stop getting software updates even if you're not in the US no matter where you are if your Huawei phone runs Google services those will stop and you'll stop these phones not get the latest version of Android basically at the end of this 90 day extension whatever software version these phones have is the one that they'll have the rest of their life which is definitely not ideal so can Huawei do about their future phones and can Huawei even make future phones without any business help fun fact they spent $70 billion dollars buying components for hardware last year 11 billion of that went to Intel etc has posted an article with a pretty good breakdown of all the parts and components that who been buying to make their smartphones and a lot of them come from us companies the Gorilla Glass the flash storage some radios unrealistic that I mean they don't want to obviously but they seem like could totally switch all of their suppliers from us companies to others to get around this it's not what they want to do of spending a lot of money and doing a lot of work but they're one of the few oems that doesn't rely on Qualcomm for the silicone they make their own Kieran 980 chip for meet 20 pro on the p30 pro so in theory with a lot of effort they could keep making these physical phones and also Bloomberg has reported that Huawei's built up a 3-month stockpile of the parts they like to use ahead of this band which is actually pretty impressive but even if they did replace all of these hardware suppliers with alternatives in the next 90 days the software it's still the big question how do you make a phone without Google without the Android licence without the Google Play store Android itself is open source just bare bone stock Android is just an open Source Project which has LED many to speculate don't need a licence you don't need to do business with Google to just use aosp so they could use bone stock Android but that's not Ide because even that is further and further from the version Google uses everyday and that still doesn't include things like Google services Gmail YouTube it's just not ideal the more I read into it it turns out Huawei's been sort of quietly bracing themselves for something like this for a while similar to Samsung they've recognised their reliance on Google and Google services as a bad thing so they've been slowly building things behind the scenes to be able to get ready to replace them supposedly they've been working on a backup OS that supports Android app and they've been working on building their own app store the problem is that is an immense challenge to try to get people to an alternate OS and an alternate app store especially if it doesn't look exactly the same as the one they're used to especially the app store and why can't you business with us companies you can't expect to be able to negotiate your way into getting the Netflix isn't Pandora's and Facebook and Instagram on your alternate app store and even if you can we've seen others like Amazon try you seen the Amazon app store right Amazon's a multi-billion dollar company and the sad version of an app store that they have is nowhere near a replacement of the ones we're used to so it's a super massive challenge to try to build up your own app store out of nowhere so this spells a lot work for Huawei like it shows how big of an impact just getting cut from your ties with Google can have on your business they've seen this coming they've known that 90 days is up continue to make phon entirely through nine us companies but those phones wouldn't have Android they wouldn't have the Google Play this is which are crucial and they wouldn't have the Google Play store stuff that's the big headlining one because they make a lot of Android phones but there's plenty of other us companies that they do business with Microsoft Intel NVIDIA Huawei has been making laptops and pretty good ones mind you competitively for a while now but as far as I can play can't keep making Windows laptops without doing business with Microsoft and NVIDIA and these companies that's brutal too so as a person that really likes tech all of this news is terrible because having one less company means less competition which is less incentive for these companies to work hard and make great stuff I mean we've seen even if you're not a fan of Huawei or if you don't like their stuff we have to admit that having them around is good for consumers it's good for us and also side note if you think about it this is also pretty bad pacifically for folding phones like the Galaxy fold kind of just had its own PR nightmare all by itself over there for a couple weeks which sort of turn people's heads to the other folding phone that would be coming to market soon which was going to be the Huawei mate x but now I mean what if it can't even run Android but hey Huawei is like I said a huge company like a really huge company so I guess if anyone can recover from such a massive setback to multiple parts of their business I guess it's them I mean this is not ideal at all their ideal case would be the government renegotiate things and they reverse things go back to normal but in the case that that doesn't happen at least they have billions of dollars to try something but even if they come back if you think about it the bigger damage might really just be the way people think about Huawei as a company to potentially buy products from no the reputation isn't exactly great especially in the US so now good luck trying to convince someone to spend $1,000 instead of an on a Huawei phone that doesn't even have the Play Store or run Android anymore that's a tough sell if you look back a very similar situation happened to ZTE in 2018 last year they got cut off from all their us business relationships and they were never the same Huawei is this Goliath so I'm thinking things will go a bit differently this time or at least I'm hoping cancel go differently for the sake of competition but to be honest this whole situation is far from over these things evolve change over time I would be shocked if this whole thing was reversed in the next couple months just because that's sort of the way things have gone recently but as of right now we're just kind of play nest on satisfying limbo as we speculate about Huawei's future but that's basically all there is to know right now I'll leave all the links for all my sources down below in case you want to read up on this yourself and of course feel free skip this video for anyone who might be headline Reading or curious about the situation Huawei's found themselves in right now and I'll catch you guys play next video peace
