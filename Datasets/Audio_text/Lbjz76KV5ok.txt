Irfan thank you so much for making time for FC unfiltered you know I read somewhere else I hope I hope it's somebody will benefit holder kind of Praise or kind of acknowledgment from people which was so their what are the choices that you've made that have made you the man you are today play getting bored with oneself just to avoid getting bored with oneself to keep my profession because I had no other way to keep engage myself no other way I had choices when I was teenager you know that Indulgence a few things and it could have you know engaged to me but somehow you know my name and you know whatever it keeps telling me that you you need to find your space where you could you could you could engage yourself because I'm terrified with myself I am I have a lot of anger I have a lot of anxiety I know I get bored with things very easily and I could never fit into the system any kind of system are there any favorite failures experience in a way that I feel like you know when I was 7 years old I was I'm passionate about flying kites and we were not well to do although I belong to a feudal family with my father didn't take anything so we were still living in rental house and are Terraces didn't have a protection it was it last night in the evening I was trying to catch up thread from it was it was hanging from a electric wire and you know I just was trying to catch it and I fell down and I broke you know all my this ankle this no sorry play stressed and sailboat and that took her at least 2 years for me to you know to recover because my father was not there my father was a hunter so he was out so nobody knew what to do so it is like play slowly slowly started losing strength again soon what about that and that was so dramatic for me images kids are you know their spontaneous and they don't understand what is cruelty and they you know indulging in making fun of each other whole school is to make fun of me and you know I started getting into my shell and I was as it never mind I was very shy guy and suddenly you know it I lost all the confidence and everything you know I was just living in my what time does Costco open tomorrow morning experience in it it made me realize it made me things that you know I I used to notice that whatever I am people are not perceiving I like that people are not they don't know what is there inside me or what lies inside me when I when I was aware of this there was a kind of organic need for me to come out of myself and do something so the realize what I am how does a child who grows up very far away from anything to do with Cinema then sort of find the courage to go into say that I want to be an actor and and how do you then get past all of that and say I'm going to make this work you don't need to tell that you don't have to talk to yourself I came to in the city in Delhi there was an atmosphere where I could watch International Cinema European Cinema now I was introduced to all this kind of cinnamon that was my you know a lot of source of inspiration and I've learned a lot from from those when I came to the city I was almost like in a middle of a Monday nobody talks about if my inspiration going the first thing I bought from my income was vcr and I was looking for and in that time I realized that this is not my real drive otherwise the inspiration would have been there so that time I realized that this is a cultivated interest of mine I need to watch turn Cinema so that you know my inspiration is pumped up Not Myself by saying that I'm a good actor I should watch actors who who who who give me a kind of you know goalpost reach the experience Florida character with these you know this is so many dimensions make a character you have goal posts but but you can't keep pumping yourself saying that I'm a good actor that would be a Folly I think it will it but it won't work for me you need something else I need something else but there are people who how to say that I love myself and I'm great and it works for them and you know this doesn't know judgment about it that you know what's wrong with I am right now what works for them so I don't know how many of you know this but if perhaps the only actor in the world who has worked with both Ang Lee and Annie's birthday I'm still struggling to to to to to to to to to to see myself as an accomplished actor where I'm I'm playing with the craft what's the struggling the thing is a lot of my time is is I give a lot of time to Hindi Cinema and you don't have so many challenges that you can keep polishing yourself as an actor I go there for 4 months 3 months then again come back here and you know I'm still you know working on my craft I'm still not as easy as microphone so that keeps you going you know that keeps you know you should be that easy then you start enjoying the you know that being an actor so set we can live without no answer you said what we need more is attitude so even if you give what does it take to give that where is the that's just that you don't need to work on it the only work you do it that you don't work too much did don't put your own sensibility on 2828 and make it liability so you purposely dumb yourself go to research on the on the character don't find its background and you know see nuances of his behavior this and that you know that this is is there two to give you know a kind of you know goosebumps to to people you know and have a good time and you're when is business movie you have related to that humor you know you enjoyed that so go on the sets and have which fits into when you when you're working on a character does not one formula which works for every character you know you will keep discovering new ways of doing it that's what you have to discover that each and every character needs a different kind of approach to to reach him this is this some kind of Revelation this happened with me and I was doing a movie with a one of my favorite the story and and something came something you know I just realized that I cannot work on this character because he makes he he he is narrative is musical he sees music and everything even in your behavior is music rhythm what is short taking is like that it's his way of telling a story like that because in earlier film Kasa I was not ready to do that because it's too dark a subject I said there are no problem I don't want to fuck myself you know it didn't but when I saw him the way he was shooting it suddenly it was not realistic he's not going through the pain is there inside him he's just playing the next one I wish I did with him recently in Rajasthan I didn't work at that character at all I just went on the sets blank I used to have a great time at night play Mahal and do it spontaneously just in there just created and that give me a lot of freedom you know that gave me no no no no no no no no crutches just Hindi Cinema give you know a superficial hypnotic thing you know is it hard for you to do can you do that easily because I was you know I don't know how it happened but I was doing a time to kind of series was equally popular it is how you how you can convincingly say your lines that that's all it was about and and Bunny give me that was OK Google put the stylish version you know nobody bought it in the cinema although it was popular in in in in in in in series jagannath and that those characters are very popular but in cinema nobody was ready to give me set timer for opportunity the stylish version of this song I got sucked into it and and lost my phone I found a couple of weeks ago I was talking to Arjun Kapoor and trying to address the issue of an actor as a celebrity versus an actor as an artist and I and this is all part of being that do you see yourself as an Entertainer I do myself see as an Entertainer but as far as art is concerned whatever you know you know the responsibilities you have just mentioned are doesn't in any of those are only comes when you start making things personal and when you start reflecting on those things call life around you life is surrounds you you know whatever you are you are absorbing as in human being and then you are your own point of view about Society about human beings through those stories if that is not happening then art is not happening you are you are just as an Entertainer actor celebrity you can call them but artists only happens when you start will confuse the audiences available I'm doing a film which is just about one-liners I have to deliver one-liners and enjoy it who was telling me about this he went to meet an actor and he was sitting in his trailer tell me a story of Oklahoma University it's your personal priority time John Orbison you start playing that game can you please please play play the video whatever works for you about will at some point are you feeling they feel like they almost belong to some kind of a substandard community until they worked with the stuff frustrated how to keep yourself you know positive and and you know interesting enough for yourself that you can enjoy yourself you don't you don't let it affect you that much but it happens because you are not bringing in that kind of money the other thing is if you are doing something which is not from the copy book what would not want regular which you are doing if you should bring in new element to your craft and which doesn't confine the Norms we didn't confirm the norms does a tendency of of of of of of of of of of of the establishment that they get threatened because they couldn't use that so there's a kind of strange way of pulling that down to bring it down and it doesn't happen directly but it happens in this kind of you know signals where you're not offered actress did you while you were creating your own space ever have a sort of Dark Night of the Soul where you just felt like yeah play John struggle against this anymore also it was because the way I was reacting to those circumstances I have mostly have done movies the first what day does making their first films and suddenly have seen them you know changing I wasn't important at all and subconsciously start banking on the steam that you know we both have you know then done something new and then you start banking on now I don't depend I learned my lesson I said it's your own Journey you cannot you know it would be on your part to start expecting that you know tomorrow that was frustrating at that time and before that when I was doing series I used to feel claustrophobic what's insecure because my juniors they were getting breaks they were doing commercial Cinema and I was struggling to just 1 minute part in Indiana movie I was doing series everybody used to talk to me talk about me so he was discussing I'm talking to directv.com about 100% you know everybody used to say baby pictures but I remember I remember you saying that it's just it's just not cool for actors to be discussing not for me not for me that you know I have I have a kind of Benchmark community what are scale to judge yourself man that whether it's an experience Sometimes some stories are not made to make that kind of money their personal stories there are certain stories which which can make money which they wouldn't have even imagine they were films which you know like baahubali movie you can't judge a storytelling on a story from that those figures figures are just by-product story is you sing it is it is alive and it interacts with you and you can see really how is interacting with you because it's a creation creation cannot be dead and I can give you many examples how a story has come and you know not to me and and you know created an atmosphere for me or challenge me on tomorrow I was I was I was getting hurt so many times and so badly you don't even you can't even without any reason I'm just walking and there's a kind of Step which I didn't realize and suddenly my back goes which my back is you know it's never you know This Is Not Fragile you know I'm I've done so many things and I'm not weak from my back and or I'm playing a cricket and suddenly so many incidents happened I told my ligament and the trouser you know before play Jessie graffiti music play my dog so that film was testing me in a different way completely and I'll give you one more example play artist so are you waiting for the camera camera what's the camera behaved what happened to Pawan Singh Tomar in his life he was a talented man he was he made you know national day was champion and his name was not there at all when we started researching about him it was absent dancing and everybody was loving it before it's released but was not getting released my 8129 months if anybody used to ask me what's happened I said I forgot one thing I don't talk to me about it and then suddenly film came out and suddenly the film stood on its own meds so C the C the C the you know the correlation between his life and filming how it interacts so I don't matter it doesn't matter what's the worst advice you see being dispensed in Bollywood did you go to fall into a kind of formula people who haven't reached their this they also have a kind of say on a what how things work and how what gives you success and this premature way of understanding things is something is the kind of folly you have play experience Kay you have made a kind of formula give us one must interact Once Upon Seasons potential and see what is unique about oneself in in in in possibility tell me about meeting you but he said you were all kinds of chill so what do you like when you're not working but I'm not working I'm I'm scattered actually I'm scattered and I I see every house I I try and find a space for myself getting around 6:45 description when you see you know actors doing wonderful roles in when you see you know people changing themselves completely and getting that cannot happen spontaneously you have to work on yourself and diligently work on yourself I should be able to keep tuning myself you know at least because my I have done a lot of slow down but I am a very Reckless man and I used to carry a lot of anger which I have it becomes a kind of what are responsibility or okay you should enjoy taking care of himself take care of yourself thanks for Inferno and I remember Tom Hanks saying something like I don't like it fun because when he walks into the room suddenly I'm not the can the USB of any actor be created or that is something which is inborn yes can you create your own USB as you start discovering yourself first this is a natural thing to eat or to imitate other Act how to find confidence when you resemble Somebody I Used to resemble somebody gave me this wrong idea that my face is similar to Mithun chakraborty and I used to feel so good louder and and I used to you know copy him and I used to tell you know there's a kind of gratification that you know I resemble this so there's a possibility you know I'm not what I am I am I know suddenly you want to you want to skip all that process and become mutant check their so but as you start discovering yourself there is a kind of organic style organic you know you're being will start reflecting on hello my name is Raj and you've done a variety of characters who were the backstories and stuff that they belong to various parts of the world Can you spot where is parts of India and how important is the diction language and the way the character speaks to developing the character in the story of the script demands that then it becomes very very and what I was doing I was trying to personalize things I was putting my own way of speaking into you know I was freshly coming from a hospital and that's what I was doing and I did in my pool and suddenly I realized that the power of the line has gone dilute Kia it was constructed language but it has its own music and own power Germany you know that the power is gone and I realized that I stuck to what is written how has becoming famous changed you as a person for example you talked what about how you had anxiety so would you say that you're happier person now that you're successful why do you ask this do you do do do do you are you asking it to understand that if one becomes popular rrr unknown does it make you happy yeah that's exactly from your personal will you know when you'll be happy person know it depends and you know what you take off popularity of Fame can can destroy you and sometimes personally with me it has healed me it you know because I don't look at popularity just popularity because I am I focus is not what I'm doing is much more important for me and doing brings the popularity so it's a byproduct what you're doing to your job will bring a kind of you know so what relationship you have with your job is it is it satisfying you if that is satisfying connector what has been the most exciting and challenging character you play till date two things exciting and challenging there were some characters very painful and I was just mentioning that in an interview I did a character in a series called in treatment it was by HBO with the Gabriel born and I mentally Disturbed person it was very complex character and his age was like 54 or 56 59 whatever I life didn't have that kind of complication so where do I bring all those elements to fit into this you know this this outline of this character that was really painful for me what what I'm going to myself to appear that I'm I'm as Disturbed as this character so the challenge was there to do that how do you spell not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not enjoyable it was painful so when the shooting was over I literally screamed play When the
