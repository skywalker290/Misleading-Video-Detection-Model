about 2 weeks and absolutely daily driver material I think people who buy it who know what they're getting themselves into will like it a lot and it's pretty easy to recommend exercise in a study of the law of diminishing return the law of diminishing returns is a point at which the level of benefits gained is less than the amount of money or energy invested so you see a $300 phone you get a certain amount of value then you spend $300 more and you get a lot more value you spend $300 more than you get a little more value and then you spend another $300 more and you get just a tiny bit more so honestly the most important feature of the oneplus 6 is what's the price it starts at 529 bucks in this world of 7 800 9000 flagship so they kind of work in reverse Direction instead of pushing value as high as you possibly can they're kind of thinking how much can we cut off of the price without pricing a significant amount of value how cheap can we make this phone and still make it great and every year 1 plus does this they have to make this balance of things I want to cut out versus things they want to keep and I think this year they've made a bunch of good choices and come out with a balanced budget experience which is most of it being positive so on the outside the build is legit the actual look of the phone might not speak to everyone but I'm a fan of the midnight black here or the matte black version while there's also a match glossier match fingerprint to your mirror black and I was also a soft white coming soon it has these awesome buttons I love these clicky buttons it has the I was actually confusing it with the power button pretty early when I first got this phone just because of the placement it's kind of phones don't necessarily have to be thin for me to like them this phone feel super solid with a lot of metal in there it has a headphone jack it has a dual SIM card tray and it even has this sub best shape when you see it in the frosted glass back it's clean so overall it honestly looks and feels quality it has a slight bump back to the camera that's not really a big deal but for the emissions there are some conscious choices that they made to leave out of this phone that they're seeing that you won't mind so much so ready for this there's no expandable storage just dual SIM card so no micro SD card expansion the speaker situation is pretty weak it just has this single downward facing speaker which is the worst part of the phone's hardware it's pretty average best kind of tinny at high volumes and there's no Second speaker in the earpiece to make a stereo sound so it's super easy to block this one by now the smaller surface area is a there's no wireless charging so most phones nowadays with glass backs are doing it to enable wireless charging since it doesn't work through metal oneplus has gone off the glass back but didn't add wireless charging and then it's also not officially IP rated for water resistance water on it it'll survive daily use but they don't officially ip67 or 68 rated so keep that in mind so it has a bunch of great upside a bunch of you know great build great materials great construction the battery situation of the oneplus 6 is really interesting they definitely could have put it in with this glass back and it would have been great but I don't really miss it on this phone the combination of this battery it's a 3300 milliamp hour battery decent size plus the nearest Android with oxygen OS plus at 1080p AMOLED display plus a Snapdragon 845 with 8 gigs of RAM I'm getting like 6 + hours every single day of screen on time I'm getting a plus battery life if I don't use it that much it's like ending the 40% is really good and then on top of all that you throw in their dash charging which is still in this phone it's still the fastest 100 charging I've ever seen in a phone it's super convenient and when you have all that it just kind of feels like I don't need now let's let's talk about that 1080p display oneplus has stuck to their guns and they're going with yet again at 1080p optic AMOLED 6.3 in from corner to corner so it's huge and this time with a notch about the top it's part strategy sacrifice the resolution 2280 by 1080 is actually hugely beneficial for battery life as I mentioned it's also pretty great performance you're not pushing nearly as many pixels which means your GPU is not working as hard everything is super smooth but also now it's not going to be a how's the Galaxy S9 and the pixel 2 XLS of the world which have quite HD displays but then again like we saw in the pixel quality control easy and a great 1440p panel is not cheap or easy to find so instead of settling for an average quad HD screen to save 1080p OLED in any fun right now it gets really bright it's colourful there's a couple different play modes for different colour profiles with different amounts of saturation it's good the best part of this display is actually the clever way oneplus has Android phones having notches and Android p coming out with notch and developer is getting on board we're seeing less and less apps with those bugs that are cut off by the notch so that's just kind of where we're at I think a lot oneplus so there's plenty that they're doing to hide it if you really hate it in fact as you get let's you hide the notch anytime if you don't want to use it works great with an OLED display those are black pixels into the app you're using it doesn't do that anymore unless you actually go into the display menu and turn on permission so by default unlike the iPhone it doesn't cut off YouTube videos this is the same as the p you still see everything and you can turn on full screen mode if you're cool with a notch interrupting part of the app you're in as it is it also has a pretty good amount of super fast facial recognition there is the gaming mode that doesn't let notifications gameplay does an ambient display mode that's new that works when you raise your phone up but it's not always on so I actually don't even really bother using it let me do that now for software updates tell me about the longevity of the phone this is actually one of the first of like maybe six phones to get included in the Android p beta program alongside the pixel so now it's not just the pixel this is one of those phones you can put the Android p beta on and that's a pretty good sign as far as the future of get updates being close to stock Android it doesn't necessarily guarantee it's going to get the same update timing as the pixel you still probably lg's many months down the road so that's pretty good things like the shelf that put a lot of useful information pretty much the only thing I don't like about the software here is the new gestures I tried them for a while and they do work perfectly fine there's no bugs or anything and they are intuitive but they're just extremely responsive and smooth to my touch and you got to give apple credit that and 1 + swipe gestures are just not that so I'm sticking to the buttons on this phone so really the last big question we have that we're wondering from The Impressions video is the camera situation on the oneplus 6 well if you saw the last video you saw the blind test you probably already have some got it from me it's like a B+ as far as camera quality in smartphone but that's because the A+ on the pixel 2 of the world and the iPhone 10 in the Galaxy S9 are way up there those are the 89000 for the price it is definitely better than primary camera with optical stabilisation and an F 1.7 aperture and it takes pretty Focus is fine overall there's plenty of detail and not a lot of noise and pretty what colour is if anything it biases maybe a little towards overexposing more often than under but dynamic range is good enough that that hasn't been a problem every photo is plenty saturated overall I'd say I'm pretty satisfied with the photos from the oneplus 6 camera I'm not blown away or anything I'm not super excited telephoto camera it's just another 20 meg pixel sensor with no ois basically used for depth information for portrait mode as far as we can tell which is ok I guess it's decent it's great I'm not going to go out of my way to use it that much but basically the idea is it doesn't take photos that are quite at the level of the highest and flagships but those flagships are so much more expensive this definitely beats any other $500 phone in fact that's really the theme for this whole oneplus 6 if flagship smartphones or it's like one small step behind but that is play beating any other 5600 Android phone the specs are ridiculous snapdragon 845 6 or 8 gigs of RAM I have 128 gigs of storage a 16 megapixel camera 3300 milliamp hour battery that's knocking at the door of like the highest and flagships we have right now definitely quality construction great buttons it might be missing wireless sing and a good speaker and IP certification but it has a dual SIM it has a headphone jack it has usb-c really fast charging great are you better than any other 5,600 phone which makes it feel like A+ for the price this is both literally and figuratively the most what to keep versus what to cut out balanced out to quality phone would have been so easy to review this phone like a $900 flagship and just bash it for like not having wireless charging or not having an A+ camera thanks
