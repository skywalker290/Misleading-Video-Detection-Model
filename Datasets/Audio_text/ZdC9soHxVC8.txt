hey what's up guys come to HD here and this is your first look at brand new Samsung Galaxy s20 and Galaxy s20 plus now there's a whole new lineup of Samsung phones out right now all out for 2020 clearly so we have the Galaxy s20 the Galaxy s20 plus and a new Galaxy s20 Ultra adopt an entire separate video on that s20 Ultra it's the new pro version in their lineup but that phone starts starts at 1399 and we don't all have a g and a half to spend on a new phone no matter how nice it is so these are the true successors to the Galaxy S10 and S10 plus the s20 and s20 plus and to me this is actually one of the biggest jumps up sing Samsung take with their phones literally everything you can think of is upgraded and they've taken the biggest jumps in the most important answer the phone so the screen the battery and the cameras so let's start with the screen these are now 6.2 inch and .7 inch displays respectively and they are 120 hertz Quad HD OLED displays so super play resolution HDR plus and super responsive High refresh rate screens this is the train I've been telling you guys flagships are all going to get on 2020 and to match that super high refresh rate Samsung has also doubled the touch sensitivity to a 240 sample rate meaning it responds to touch input twice as fast and the whole new speed difference is instantly noticeable now obviously Bill tough for me to show you guys in this at 30fps YouTube video but yeah literally everything from swiping around the UI to opening and closing apps and scrolling and eventually of course gaming everything will look and feel smoother and I think to be a bit shorter and snappier too so you can easily tell it feels play smoother than 60 HZ and I can actually tell the difference versus 90 as well which I've gotten used to hey editor Marquez quick with a little message little asterisk so Galaxy s20 is at 120 HZ are actually going to be limited to 1080p not full resolution 1440p so this is something I just found out later after the briefing I didn't even really notice while using it but if you to get the phone out the box it will be at 1440 p and at 60 H and when you go into the settings to change it to move it what's 220 HZ it'll lock you at 1080p probably to save battery life and power and things like that small asterisk on what we've learned about the phone but figured I'd let you know back to the video so I'm super happy about the screen and on top of all that there is now the center punch you can see which actually prefer because unlike the corners there's usually nothing being blocked in the middle and it's now actually flattered which is so unlike Samsung because they've always been the ones to push the curved glass melting over the sides but hey new decade new song now this display doesn't melt over the edge nearly as much or kind of at all it's much more flat in my opinion much more usable and I still have the ultrasonic fingerprint reader of course underneath the display now let's talk about battery for a second they have increased the recess is on all these phones buy a healthy amount too so it's a 4000 milliamp hour battery on a smaller s20 and a 4500 play vampire battery on the s20 plus so they're not trying to make these phones super razor thin which is great they're actually just tiny bit thicker but it's also probably because with a huge bright 120 HZ display you're going to want all the battery you can get so this is something we're going to have to test of course when we get the phone in for the full review but I'm at least glad to see on the spec sheet much charge yourself plus there's still 25 watt fast charging with that charger included in the box and wireless charging too and while we're at it the specs boom there you go high and CPU and insane 12 gigabytes of RAM on all of them expandable storage ip68 certified I mean these phones are complete on the spec sheet not quite as wild as the s20 ultra no big shortcomings as you'd expect from a Samsung Flagship and the entire lineup is also all 5G capable but I don't think this is quite a game-changer as much as some people will try to make it out to be you know the s20 and s20 plus they will not do millimeter and so it'll say 5G in the corner but we talked about this in a previous video it's only going to be up to about 20% faster than good 4G on a good day and so I wouldn't buy this phone just for the 5G so anyway let's hit the last probably most important new piece of these new phones with the Galaxy s20 and that is the cameras they are a huge Focus for Samsung in these new phones you're pun intended and I haven't seen the unpacked slideshow slides yet I'm recording this before that are you willing to bet that probably half of them at least half are about cameras so you're looking at a new triple camera setup for the s20 and the s20 plus has room for an extra death sensor but otherwise they're the same things here with a new 12-megapixel main sensor add F 1.8 then there's a 3X 64 megapixel telephoto camera at f2 and a 12 megapixel ult what at F 2.2 and they are all physically larger sensors than last year which is great for pretty much everything light sensitivity low-light performance and anything else basically to do with photography and there's some serious zoom capabilities not just Optical but with software giving you a 10x multiplier that's going to give you a comfortable 30X hybrid zoom and I know this isn't a are the ultra but that phone has a 10x Zoom which means the hybrid Zoom with software will go up to 100x which is ridiculous but they'll call all of this space Zoom could have called a Galaxy Zoom but I guess that works as well but the nice on top of all this is their all capable of 8K 24fps video across the whole lineup 8K video in a smartphone camera sounds incredible sounds like something I put in my dream phone but there is a catch who is already big but 8K video is 33 megapixels per frame which is awesome because you can get the ability of being able to pull 33 megapixels stills from a video but to get that you have to have a window of a sensor big enough to 8K video which means you need at least a 33 megapixel sensor but the main camera on these phones like I mentioned is that 12 megapixel sensor it's the 3x telephoto that's 64 megapixels so when you go into the settings and turn the video res listen to 8K like I did that's going to be coming from that telephoto camera not the main camera so it's going to punch in a bit as you can convenience side also 8K doesn't support tracking autofocus or video effects yes but it's not from the main sensor it's punched in that's just a little bit extra to stop when maxing out video on this phone so it's not like the dream world where we can stream 8K over 5G to YouTube without even thinking about it just not quite there yet either way though as you can tell with the entire rest of this phone not a whole lot change the button situation so now the buttons have moved back over to the right hand side and the dedicated Bixby button is gone there are also pretty lightweight phones as well despite their size and the bigger batteries impressed with how good they feel in the hand and how light they are compared to some other big phones and Samsung's one UI 2.0 has some need Improvement well now I'd be lying if I said I loved it it's still far from my favorite flavor of Android but there's still things like building resume preview into the camera app now so when your zoomed in super far you still get that preview in the top left of what the hell you're zooming into play Super useful and there's other stuff like Spotify now integrated into Bixby routines and HD Google Duo video chat built natively into the dial and some other stuff like the subtle new animations and there's also a new single take mode in the camera it's like the go to promote basically instead of you doing all the hard work of taking several photos and videos you just hit the shutter button once and point play some action and I'll decide for you when to take photos and videos based on you know when eyes are open and faces are smiling and stuff that seems kind of cool but this isn't something I think I'll ever use call me crazy but I like taking the photos myself but at the end of the day if you look back at this whole thing turn on the spec sheet and everything you've done with this phone it's hard to find anything you could consider a weakness or a complaint or a better a bad thing about this phone aside from maybe the price of course a lot of this is on paper and based on like the 2 hours that I spent with I'm getting this footage but honestly I'm excited to review this phone definitely subscribe to be among the first to see that when it comes out if you haven't already yeah is it too early to call Samsung a front-runner for the most improved award just based on how many things are better about this phone I don't know something to think about either way thanks for watching and definitely check out the Galaxy s20 Ultra video first link below like button if you haven't watch that check that one out too catch you guys on the next one piece
