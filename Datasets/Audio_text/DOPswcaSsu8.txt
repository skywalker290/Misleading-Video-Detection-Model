and yes some secrets are harder to keep than others but this is a good one so for the past 2 weeks I've been using sing the new Mac Pro which means every video you've seen since then since the MacBook Pro review has been edited on the Mac thank you very much for watching catch you later peace but play this is something I've been personally waiting for for the better part of the last 6 years or so since the 2013 trash can Mac Pro came out and full review I figure I might as well give you my Second Impressions or my Impressions from using it daily for the past 2 weeks to the box is clearly really interesting there's some Velcro on each side you get past that it's it's 300 cheese grater Mac Pro box but a little nicer on one side to get your magic keyboard in its own relax and on the other side you have a magic mouse a magic Trackpad and a braided black lightning cable I don't get back to those in a minute in the last step to getting it out the box is gripping it by those top handles and this thing is pretty heavy it's solid metal so I guess I shouldn't be surprise but it is very dense and then in the Box we just took it out of on the bottom you have your design by Apple in California quit and underneath that is another braided cable this one's the power cable and it's definitely sturdy and high quality for that 1400 watt power and as a matter of fact in with the rest of the Mac Pro paperwork you do in fact get yes two not one but two gig black Apple stickers these are going to be the biggest Apple stickers I've ever seen maybe you can put them on your car or something so yeah new Mac Pro and as you can see two Pro display xdr on their Nifty thousand dollar stands that I'm using for the past 2 weeks we saw this already at WWDC and I my first impression is there I'll link it below if you want to rewind that a bit but this is like a Second Impressions so here's the specs of this machine that I've been using it's got a maxed out 28 core Intel Xeon wcpu 384 gigs of 933 megahertz RAM and two of the AMD Radeon Vega Pro 2 MPX modules with 32 gigs of vram on each hard and then there's 4 TB of storage and it does have the afterburner card so not maxed out but as you can tell very nicely equipped I probably will end up getting something around this same spec and the 8 terabytes of SSD storage since that's just a massive amount of room and not only your storage but your dim Slots of how you're using play 6 channel Ram you can see this one's using half of the slots right now and the PCI slots so you can see this top one is Apple's built-in the afterburner card is below it and then the two MPX modules which are double height with the Radeon Pro cards below those and it even shows which unpopulated BCI slots is blocking so to share a few things you'll notice right off the bat first of all the accessories that comes with the mouse the keyboard the magic Trackpad are keyboard and trackpad that came with the iMac Pro now you have a black trackpad silver bass and black bottom and a magic keyboard that's black keys with silver base and even the magic mouse that it comes with goes from space gray top and bottom to Silver bottom with a gloss black top and I don't know how many people buying a Mac are sticking with the magic keyboard and Magic Mouse but hey it's a nice touch and then the thing is just I know it's off camera cuz it's under my desk right now but it is really well and of course the cheese grater look we all refer to it as is very distinctive there's like little spheres in the front with circular cutouts on the is of those fears hopefully that explains it but all around tight tolerances not really any unnecessary gaps anywhere but as you can see this one that doesn't have the wheels just got metal flat feet but I think I'm actually get the wheels possibly and then the ports so okay the main accessible ones that are on the top front are just your two Thunderbolt ports which are next power button and the little white glowing power indicator that's pretty basic then at the back you get by default two full-size and then two more Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack and then each GPU module is giving you an HDMI and four more Thunderbolt and all the way at the bottom next to power is dual 10 GB ethernet ports nice and that's not a sarcastic nice either that's like actually really for me for me that's the super fast internet we can go wired in and the jellyfish drives that we ended up but yeah only two full-size USB what's I kind of would have liked to have seen a little bit more than that many many Legacy peripherals at this point that a lot of Mac Pro continue to use aren't updated to USB type-c yet so for me I instantly populated those that was the the receiver for my mouse and the card reader so already that's full there's also an internal usba Port but I found that when I put the mouse receiver it tends to start glitching and then sort of get worse reception so I never really put that inside so yeah not ideal I there were like two more usb-a ports on the back or maybe I should just get another usb-c card reader because at this point this is my only USB type play card reader and I kind of hate that anyway okay opening up the Mac Pro is really as simple as it looks there are no thumb screws like normal cases it's just a huge twist latch at the top rotate it halfway and the entire shell slides off cleanly exposing the insides simple as the top containers on the right side here hold the RAM and then if you flip it around you can see there's your die slots the big MPX modules with the graphics cards at the bottom and on the long afterburner card right above them and a CP full size usb-a Port right above apples built-in card so I have two main takes that I've not one it's really quiet and two it's really fast the quietness is pretty objective I mean you can put its 4 ft from the mic right now and you can't really hear it but in a normal office environment it's not the loudest thing in any room hard drives better than it any fans anything else in the area is louder it's very quiet I don't keep it on my desk cuz there's not enough room with the speakers but I could one fan for the power supply on one side and then three large fans at the front just blowing air through all the time so there's no dedicated water cooling pump puer fan or GPU fans or anything separate like that everything inside is passively cooled and just depends on the air flow run through from the three big friends at the front that's what makes that cheese grater whole design so important it's really an air flow design and that's also something to keep an eye on down and it's also potentially concerned as Linus mentioned in his first impressions video of dust getting in because there is no obvious air filter in front play for behind any of these fans I like that it doesn't intake air from the bottom that means I can put it on any carpeted surface and be fine but we have to keep turn dust that might eventually make its way into the machine and affect thermals we'll see but also yeah it's really fast as you would expect from sing with 28 cores and 384 gigs of RAM score you know it's great it's the highest I've ever turn on any computer love that I also did a black magic disc speed test and is it expect from the internal SSD 3 gigabytes second again hilariously fast but if I can just hold off on benchmarks for a minute the main place I'm noticing the difference is the main place where my it was Heavy the main reason I wanted a Mac Pro and that's in video editing so for me that's Final Cut Pro so if you remember the the rendering speed test I did MacBook Pro review I rented out this clip from Red raw and I had my times for the MacBook Pro and the iMac Pro but I couldn't tell you guys video but I also tested the Mac Pro on that same test so the render speeds for this MacBook Pro were about 20 minutes the render speed for the iMac Pro brought it all the way down to around 11 minutes and that Mac Pro did that same and exported it in 4 minutes and 20 seconds let's hear some reference for some people who might not appreciate that that's exporting that's transcoding an 8K red code clip I typically turn on 81 compression ratio as I did with the test Clip 2 to 1 aspect ratio no background rendering and just went straight through in faster than real time so it was a 5-minute clip on the timeline exported the whole thing in less time than it would take to just watch that clip so yeah that's pretty great I will get much more into detail in performance and how well it does in the if you guys have more suggestions for different ways that you want me to test it that's welcome in the comments section below specific workflows and things like that but I've been very happy with the performance and none of this is even been taking advantage of the afterburner card yet because that's optimized for prores footage and Playback I've been shooting begin our 3D red raw but I will of course give this shot with Perez footage for the full review as well that's what it's made to streamline but in the meantime I am super pumped about Mac Pro my two weeks with it have been relatively pain-free just setting everything up again I'm but my take is this is one of those tools that I'm just excited about as a Creator I feel like at this point you know 2019-2020 it takes a lot to get me inspired as a Creator because the tools I have in my disposal are so unlimited like there's no way I can take this camera to its full potential but I was play consistently pushing the iMac Pro the fastest machine that runs Final Cut Pro to its full potential so it's not like magic it's not like having a snack Pro is going to make my videos better or make anyone's videos better but it's just it's it's sort of a Headroom for what I'm willing to try as a Creator because of power or speed or time I think for a lot are there workflows this represents the same thing so yeah thank you for making this and thank you for watching this Second Impressions video definitely be sure to get sub add to see the full review when it comes out if you haven't already and looking forward to seeing your comments chat with you guys on the next one
