show me the video recently about the Apple airpods they came back into my life I've been using the airpods what kind of enjoying it they're wildly successful you see them out in the world other manufacturers in their entering the space this is the latest incarnation of the fully Wireless Samsung earbud product has a couple of features that haven't been play my favorite one is the fact that this entire setup can charge from any phone that supports Wireless charge sharing because this is a Samsung product and this is a Samsung phone there's also some interplay there that's a bit smoother than play otherwise be with a third party pair of earbuds earbuds but once you're into the app this is where I think they have did you have an advantage over the airpods they're super configurable here we can see the battery life of each individual you can use one independently of the other you can keep one of these guys charging in the case while listening to the other one there's some different equalizer settings here for a bass boost soft Dynamic clear and so on you can manage how these things deal with notifications they do have launch pads on the side unlike the airpods these have interchangeable ear tips and ear hooks as well look at all those options the airpod you've seen it before doesn't fit that far into the ear canal for some people this fits really well others it won't stay your ears these on the other hand are going to be a bit more predictable because they sit further in the ear canal and they have that secondary rubber plasticky comp they should just be a bit more secure in their considering the way that they're designed airpod is a bit taller but also which one should I get considering that you can use either on multiple platforms they do work as Bluetooth headsets you can use the airpods on Android you could use the Galaxy buds on iOS within the app there's also a play my earbuds button so that'll track these down these things could be pretty easy to lose I mean they are tiny also there's a pretty cool Ambient sound option I can actually Elevate the volume of the Ambient sound of sound around me so it'll be Amplified my ear so I can hear my surroundings while I'm listening to music podcast audiobook and so on now you can toggle that all the way down so that is muted and what's going on around me is muted you can have Ambien if you're on the bike your cycling you need to hear if if a car honks its play something this can really amplify your surroundings of course it's not on the airpods there's also a voice Focus feature in there this looks for voices specifically and allows them to cut through that that particular frequency range I find this to be useful from time to time the way that the touchpad works you can tap to play or pause the track double tap to play the next track answer or end a phone call tap to play the previous track and touch and hold to use a user configurable user's choice you can have that launch something specifically do something specifically and that's user configurable that's nice now that I have it for quick Ambient sound I'm going to touch and hold and see if I can lighten up the surroundings here we go oh wow that's cool it toggles ambient mode while you're holding your fing on the touchpad I'm in ambient right now I can totally hear my conversation hear my own voice now do I look a little strange doing this quite possibly but the question you all have is like how do stack up against the airpods now as you guys know I'm an S10 user this is the device that's currently in my pocket so the effectiveness of it has to be in correlation to this particular device we talked about some advantages within the app who knows I might be willing to give up those extra features in exchange for potentially Better Sound I'm not really sure will start with the Galaxy buds I want to make sure I've got maximum volume okay so now I know I've got max volume a little sample okay now we're in soft right now Dynamic clear Bass okay I'm wondering right now is the people I have tested these already had them in full volume or not because I read some of those things that you read and that was the experience I was having until I made sure the what's themselves were max volume and the phone was max volume now there's a lot more thump way are people doing it wrong I'm Hearing Instruments I was gone for a minute did the trick sort of I've heard better kind of feel like I got to do this exact same track right now on the airpods like right now without further Ado hurry up hurry up hurry up way less isolation I hear the the fan on the blow my brains out you know obviously I've tried some very expensive head Kirk and whoever else happens to be behind here in any given day these are tiny Mental Floss situations look at them in terms of sound I think I can say based on that quick little test right there how much does a bit more thump to it maybe my expectations were too high either probably closer to this performance than they are headphone performance that said the most striking difference for me between the two is the when you put these on you feel isolated but there's a drawback to that I not this is a kind of a tighter feel by had to choose this is a bit more from my particular ear canal and that's part of the reason I think I keep reaching for the airpods in the first place not because they sound the best but because that could be a good thing or a bad thing neither are going to be an amazing audio experience but really these products are about convenience you have to give certain points to the new Samsung product because it affected it can charge wirelessly and off of another thing worth noting the Galaxy buds are a bit cheaper than the air that's not much of a surprise that is a hard pick I really don't know I mean it might be so simple as if you're on on Samsung or an Android you might go you'll probably go for these just for the easier pairing across devices oh it's a hard decision I'd say if I'm about to do what kind of physical activity if I'm going for a jog or something I don't jog but like let's say I did I will probably reach for these ones it's just a bit more confidence play fit but if it's just if it's in an environment like around the house I actually really like the idea of not feeling the thing in your ear as stupid as that looks you forget that it's there I already have so many great sounding headphones if I want to get down to what's with music I think I'll probably still reach for these more because of that factor and then also keep my Sony headphones the DED I need over ear headphones with the noise cancellation everything else keep those for the Discerning listening but if I didn't have those other headphones and I needed something that could isolate better than the airpods and I can only have one pair I only had 130 bucks for one pair only have one pair of headphones I probably would choose these over these but in conjunction with a really nice pair that you use sometimes this is the I don't even notice I'm wearing them headset that's the bottom line
