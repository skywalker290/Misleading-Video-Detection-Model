Jabra fan you haven't played PewDiePie's pixeling it's out it's finally out I'm so excited obviously I'm going to be biased obviously I love this game it's so fun all right PewDiePie's tuber simulator it's been real out of Minds have been working on this game for a long time we wanted to make a game that was more competitive this time we haven't launched ranking yet it was coming very soon I will do a couple of ranked matches later but basically the gist of the game is turn bass real time strategy I love Pokemon PewDiePie it's really weird but it's super fun and it really works and I think what I really like about it is that you can play single player and multiplayer whatever way you like to play I'll do an easier level just to demonstrate okay let's do a map of all your completed hi what's the greatest game of all time the story is really funny and cute and obviously this is a very old school PewDiePie references but it's very wholesome in a way I really like who does a lot of range damage and Maya which is good for healing orange bar fills up that means they're ready to attack and when the yellow dots are ready that means the special attack which charges up you can obviously change in and switch positions I'll show you that in a second when he makes sense for me to do it I tend to just focus on trying to get down one I want Maya to take more damage to switch her in the middle do some painting while I was going to die soon but I also really want the other one to die so I'll do my special attack more more generically all the animations I think that's a really really cool thing that I'm really proud of and just scratching the surface of the game so many more pretty and cool pixelings and areas and things in general that are just I don't know it's just so impressive to have a hey my special attack sea level up your pixelings you can find food I didn't feed them to level them up and if you find more of extra You Can level them up you'll find your favorite ones and then you'll keep leveling those up basically so here are my pictures right now this is my rooster there's different types my heels randomly add all open some now just for the sake of it hey I got burnt I already got burned and Edgar cute okay I got some bugs this is the first time I spend anything in the game you really don't have to it's just to show off more stuff I stayed up all night yesterday to playing I'm Legit addicted to my own game okay I know I'm just talking too much is that all right let's open that chest see what we get all right hey period I think that means I can level up Foods now because I have many of them what is that we got a rare nice hey we got Shannon nice cool I never used these well God damn I know who I'm replacing sorry you're sexy but Shannon all the way to 75 and then there will be more and more and more we have a ton of stuff and yeah the point is to collect them all this is obviously that's the final and that's Marzia those are all the ones you can get in down and then there's a floatopia there's many different ones that's going to come up if you get stuck in name a really great way and and really the point of the game is to play ranked I played a couple before and I won let's see if I can do that again it'll sing my sucking my own game all right here we go we're playing against qql make you you're about to get schooled against the pee man imagine playing against PewDiePie I'm not even knowing about it Go Shannon all right his Eagle is about he's probably pretty good level 42 sponsor Eagle how am I going to beat that you play dirty I feel like I should just try and prevent is there eagle from attacking honestly he's the one that's going to do all the damning okay so I'm going to stun spawns what's going to be my strategy will wait for him to attack nice and then we'll swap these so do I I make moves too sings sponsor Eagle send his stuff is a lot higher level than me this is not fair all right let's move I need sponsor Eagle to die I forgot to move damn I'll do another stand on it oh that's a lot of damage that's a lot of damage but can we finish him that's fine if you want to do that move I don't mind this is very even I think he's done more damage yes that was awesome okay there's hope oh God now it's what do I do what do I do what so I'm freaking out yes oh my God that damaged I'm nervous 69 that's Epic this is so close come on he said come on come on come on double damage triple damage going to start soon yes yes I'm going down embarrassing take your high levels and get out of here my game my game very nice play competitive gameplay I think that's super fun on mobile games cuz it's casual it's but it's still like intense which I really really like I think they nailed it every time me and out of Minds play against each other that is so fun hopefully soon we'll be able to you can battle against your friends and stuff like that but yeah I'm just super out of atomized for making such a cool game all the feedback that I've seen has been really really positive it seem like you guys really like the game as well which makes me really good obviously the game is free so obviously comes with packs and stuff like that whenever your opinion is on that I don't know but I'm glad we're able to have it free I think it's cool and considering how much we spent making why is this reaction to the game and all the creatures and yes we did next game at the same date as Pokemon cuz you know what we were confident that this was going to be the greatest game of all time that's how we knew hey kids you want to not pay for Pokemon this game is free it's out it's free it's that big damn that's a lot of damage all right switch Shannon Shannon you need to wait thank you there it is turn it up turn it off Shannon you suck if any character nice you don't get that which is like you obviously want three stars and everyone so I already messed up but you're worth continuing to get the XP in the point I always finish up anyway I called your damage suck call that damage I think we know this is when testing is that if you're good at the game if you are actually good at it you should be able to win every time no I'm not against other people I mean on the same sort of rooster and very nice I don't want very nice I want zero dabs what you can have symbol name in Minecraft oh nice Quest is a great way to level up your stuff as well definitely I forgot we had that and you can boost if you want if you feel like it dude Shannon is going to destroy I should level up myself as well that's nothing to say do I need to grow on my beer now to play this game properly I feel like why is no one talking in my guild everyone Janice you can only have two rarest that makes sense so you can't just get all the over hey hey I guess I go first okay all right what was that damage hello why is this actually closed yes oh my God am I doing it no no no no no no no no no no no no come on more damage more damage oh Jennifer you're a babe strip next feels good give me that chance open that chest what do we got sleepy yes best game of all time we're almost there come on Edgar now it's not the time to eat random trash so cute just wait until hey delete this got Jennifer versus Jennifer and PewDiePie versus PewDiePie which PewDiePie is the strongest PewDiePie that damage switch these come on come on dang it we missed the crate and then we throw it back that's right yeah Jennifer my babe I love her so competitive with keeping track of your bars keep track of your enemies bar trying to fake them out trying to understand what they're doing nice three stars baby 0 * 5 it's okay I'm so glad to find a be able to play the game cuz I've been playing it but every I'm the update them to
