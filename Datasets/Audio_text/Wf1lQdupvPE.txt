okay okay okay okay okay okay and welcome back to extended coverage of the world's most densely packed keynote WWDC 2019 so one of the many things I showed off on stage during that 2-hour Plus event was the next version of iOS iOS 13 so I sat through that 2 1/2 hour keynote so you don't have to and I installed the super buggy iOS 13 beta on my iPhone so you don't have to either so these are the best of those new features coming to iOS for your future iPhone or maybe your current iPhone top 5 iOS 13 features so number is the speed optimizations so this is a pretty minor thing it seems they sort of opened with it for a hot minute and if you blinked you might have missed it but play some pretty bold claims by ILS 13 speed versus the already really fast iOS 12 they went along the lines of 30% faster face ID unlock and 50% smaller packages for app downloads and 60% smaller for app updates so there should be much faster downloads and installing of especially the bigger ones and 2 times faster launch speeds wow now again this is a beta so those things are still being worked on and I don't know if it's a placebo but the one thing I do feel like I noticed is the faster face ID unlock especially when putting it side-by-side against Iowa the two times faster app launching speeds that is tough to see because the beta is so buggy and things are constantly crashing and lagging all the time so I can't ver play that but I'm really looking forward to that overall I was 12 is already faster than previous versions especially on older devices so I'll welcome another speed upgrade the number four is shared wireless audio so this is like a headphone splitter but for airpods so they showed it on stage as two people sort of holding their iPhones near each other and then enabling audio sharing so they can basically let's hear the same thing from one source so then that gets your mind going about different ways that this could be useful that could be fun for two people next to each other on a plane watching the same movie together but both with wireless headphones or maybe going for a run with someone and both listening to the same music at the same time things like that so it seems like a pretty cool feature to have now I say seems like it because I haven't gotten it to work yet on my betta I tried for a while apparently other people have gotten it to work I'm just going to attribute it to the fact that it's super unstable but this is something that I'm going to be thankful for having when traveling so play solid new audio feature that of course takes advantage of having Bluetooth 5.0 the number three is the new keyboard and I can put new I want to say maybe about a decade now but the stock keyboard now on iOS 13 has swipe typ that's it so you could do this with third-party keyboards like Swype or the Google keyboard if you install them on your iPhone in the past but now it'll be built in so you can have all your keyboard suggestions and everything you're used to in one place with swipe typing I personally love it for typing longer sentences what's on bigger screens not sure if this is also coming to iPad OS but it's welcome on the iPhone okay so those last three were a bit more minor updates as you can tell but I think these next two the top two are pretty major so number two is an overhaul of what's maybe one of the top three the most used apps on anyone's iPhone the photos app so I got a pretty good demo of this at WWDC but it's also working pretty well on my Beta 2 is organized a bit different and it gets a bunch of new features that I like so at the bottom you have these couple of different photo modes you have photos mode which is literally just a grid of everything then days mode which lets you scroll through the best photos you've taken each day with does Smart highlights of certain ones that thinks you'll like then months again zooms a bit out and gives you the best photos of each month and then years again zooms out giving you a throwback of some of the best stuff from each previous year 2018 2017 2016 sort of a rewind of what happened around that day each year and then when you're actually in a photo the editing controls are pretty sweet they got an upgrade what's more expensive and smartly laid out and fluid you can do auto adjustments if you want or really dig down into their with contrast and color sharpening noise reduction and there's also red eye correction built in and you can still mess with the same filters as before but the best part anyway is that this also applies to videos so you can mess with the same edits to color contrast sharpness even noise reduction for video is still there which is amazing and this also means you can now rotate a video which you literally could not do an iOS 12 photos app along with flipping and there's tilting and warping and perspective changes for every single clip you can even change the aspect ratio so there's a lot going on and I'm a fan and I hope Google photos also can build this stuff and that brings us to number one the most anticipated feature of iOS it got the loudest cheer or at least one add one from the crowd and that is dark mode on iOS 13 so loved her to hate it people have been wishing for this and asking for it for years the all white colors of iOS can be blinding so now there's a system-wide dark mode you can enable it from the control center and it turns all your stock apps and menus and notifications and widgets and everything dark dark dark backgrounds light text the whole stock now all the third-party apps inside those you still have to change them yourself so if you want everything dark like YouTube and Twitter and all the rest you have to toggle those yourself but yeah that quick toggle for the UI is now super simple and easy to switch everything black and now with that play some new wallpapers to go with it built into iOS 13 so these actually the couple new ones with the little dark and light logo in the corner are dark mode compatible I guess I'll say so they will automatically switch when you toggle dark mode they'll switch between them back and forth between dark plus if you don't use one of these you can turn on dimming so whatever wallpaper you have will dim to be darker if you have dark mode on and hey you might even a little bit of battery since the iPhones of course all use OLED displays that don't use power when the color black is displayed so there it is finally night mode for iOS 13 there's also a couple smaller things that didn't quite make this list kind of like how every year Apple always has that little play slide with all the stuff that they wanted to make sure you knew were getting included but they didn't have time to go over so if you actually pause on that exact slide from the keynote this year they actually did it again and there's something called Wi-Fi selection and control center so now if you're in control center you can 3D touch the Wi-Fi lights on and a list of networks pop up seems like the intuitive thing to do Bluetooth does the same thing and that's actually something that the newest Emoji improvements so you can add piercings now to your emoji or even put are pods in its ears so I guess that's a Thing Worth knowing there's also login with apple which is how to replace other social logins but with much more security instead as the focus like a really impressive dedication to shielding your information turn on the company is that keep asking for your login so they'll generate a dedicated login email address randomly every time you log in so can't swipe yours very nice and then the volume box of course is finally fixed so for reference here is press 12 and the ridiculous volume changing and here is IOS 13 right next to the volume rocker nice and small clean much better so that is it that is the best of the new features coming to iOS 13 that we know about anyway my personal favorite is still dark modes so obviously I put that a number one but let me know what you're looking forward to most in the comments below and this is still super early in the beta it'll be a public beta in about a month and then eventually rolling out to people beyond that so you can expect it stable either way that's been it thank you for watching catch you guys later
