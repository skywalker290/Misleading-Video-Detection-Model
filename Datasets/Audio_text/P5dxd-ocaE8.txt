YouTube next every year the biggest celebration of of the top stuff on YouTube that year the biggest creators the best videos the memes everything at least we thought a lot of people have asked me about this you may have noticed about a week ago YouTube Rewind 2018 was upload and it's not exactly doing too hot in fact it's currently in just a few days the second most disliked no ever uploaded of all time first place being Justin Bieber's baby and it's on Pace to pass that so the most outwardly hated video ever uploaded to the site and it's all part of this bigger overwhelming shift sentiment about YouTube Rewind from the good old days of 2013 2014 2015 till now but why why is this happening that's the question naturally I think the problem with YouTube Rewind at least as I see it is pretty simple actually YouTubers and what is an audiences see it as one thing and YouTube who's in charge of making it sees it as something completely different YouTubers like me and I've been in YouTube Rewind actually the past couple years now and creators and and all of us tend to think of YouTube Rewind as this big celebration of looking back at the biggest YouTubers the biggest YouTube events things that happened on the site past year and Rewind just looking back at it all makes sense right and that is what it started out as actually YouTube Rewind give me 11 the first one is literally Rebecca Black counting down the top 10 most viewed videos on YouTube that year sing in number one Friday by Rebecca Black so this kind of established it's like the whole point is to rewind and look back at what the biggest things on YouTube expanded it to include more YouTube moments more memes more references sort of became like this honored to be included in YouTube Rewind now this all makes sense but at a certain point YouTube started sing it differently so as YouTube as a site starts to grow and expand you got to see from the other side too this with the scale and the massive changes they obviously our company that has to make money and the way they do that is by pairing advertisers to content so they started seeing can you rewind as a place to Showcase all the best stuff that happens on YouTube for advertisers and how fast forward to this era of safety and post-apocalypse and all these things it's become more important than ever for that relationship between YouTube and advertisers to remain strong and for them to show the best stuff on the platform to those advertisers so YouTube Rewind turned into this like hey check out all these advertiser-friendly things for you to spend your money on all these super clean creators and these late night show hosts play things that you want your ads next to so YouTube Rewind in a way just turned into a giant ad for YouTube that's the truth so the Delta between what YouTubers and creators and audiences want rewind to be and what YouTube it keeps making is clearly why people are so upset everyone has good reason to be mad about you know big YouTubers or moments that play wished we're in rewind for 2018 the KSI versus Logan Paul fight just for example some big things that happened they were big in 2018 on YouTube and they Will Smith Trevor Noah John Oliver all not really YouTub I mean Will Smith I guess at this point sort of but also not all that really big in 2018 Pacific Lee but yet they're all in rewind 2018 for some reason that reason being that that looks pretty good to advertise and then to top it all off I think generally dial of YouTube Rewind has been sort of difficult sort of problematic I think even if they did include all these things everyone wants to see the video was just it's just kind of hard to watch and this is just coming for me I'm just one guy and I happen to make videos but YouTube Rewind is not made by one guy it's a production team so it's made every year by a company called portal a production company and YouTube is the client and they just try to shove everything into this video every year and I think that's the mistake like take a look back Look Backwards at YouTube Rewind 2011 the first 2 minutes long is Rebecca Black talking through the hits of the Year simple you know there's there's a little Montage in the middle of some great moments the names the references it's great but it's one Creator and it's one song Levels by Avicii and then 2012 the next year this is the first year they actually brought people in and creators in to shoot new content instead of just bringing in viral videos from that and whole videos of Gangnam Style remix so if you remember Gangnam Style the whole thing is 4 minutes long and actually if you look at the credits this photo is everyone featured in YouTube Rewind 2012 it's simple you can catch everything you could appreciate everything this was maybe Peak rewind as far as actual video style if you asked me so then next year YouTube Rewind 2013 this is the year the first year they tried to you a lot it's a mashup style it's 6 minutes long and there's six songs in the DJ earworm mashup of the year there are 56 creators there's also Cookie Monster and Jimmy Kimmel but the rest were creators and this is the first one that was produced by Porto a if I had to guess this is also the first year they started sort of using rewind to share with advertisers I think we you know the community sort of gave this one a pass we liked it it was a sort of first one of the style felt original still felt like a sort of a celebration of rewinding and looking back at YouTube and there was rewind 2014 again a mash-up style 95 creators there were six songs this time and what does fast motion and cutting to show more things just I felt like they're trying to shove more things in each time just absolute chaos and then on and so forth to YouTube Rewind 2017 which is just that the peak of it all this is last year there's a bunch of late night talk show hosts bunch of creators a bunch of traditional celebrities etcetera its 7 minutes long and the video is just flying it's just it's just barrage I'm actually I was talking a bit with the director as we were shooting it in LA this year and we were actually talking about how this year's rewind was going to be different actually before I even went we were on a call about it but like they talked about you know this year there were hundreds 300 plus creators last year this we're going to cut it down to 100% of the comments this is the first time we're going to actually give creators of voice in rewind so I kind of felt like they were getting something there it felt like they understood that they have to cut back a little bit the last one which was the first one actually seemed to get a bit of a negative reception wasn't sustainable they cut it down and actually fun fact I was told again this is before we even shot this I was told that they were planning on in show with Will Smith and met with him about what he would have and Rewind apparently he independently said good night and my name MKBHD I can't verify this I want to believe but apparently that was his own suggestion hey well passionate I would love to collab I got all kinds of ideas but apparently that's that's his own idea but then I get there to the shoot it's in LA I'm there all day for we're shooting for 12 to 14 hours with a bunch of other creators who were awesome we did a bunch of takes of jumping out of the fortnite that's a bunch of different expressions with everyone on the bus everyone has different lines and different things are doing towards the camera I did a stunt for a couple of hours so yes me falling out of the bus at the beginning of the video was actually me harnessed in costume on zip line actually falling past the camera so that happened and there's a whole clip on someone's hard drive somewhere back at Port Ole of me like Landing in the realizing where I am at like looking down at my costume understanding that I'm on a bus and the bus is flying Will Smith put me here and we're going to have to jump is this what you wanted it was all of that but then the actual Jeff got cut down to this fortnite and Marques Brownlee is this what you wanted do you know who I would have asked for that was it and that's a cool clip and everything I loved watching it but but as someone who is there that clip didn't convey the whole point of the shoot it's just kind of all lost you barely realize what's happening you may be take some of it in and then it's on to the next scene and that's how it is with every single clip it's just the Montage style all over again I'm sure if you talk to other YouTubers you know Casey Liza spell who were in like these 4-second clips they were probably shooting for a whole day with much more in mind and it wander up with YouTube Rewind 2018 this chaotic barrage of Clips that's just really hard to watch make the problem with this mashup style rewind video in 2018 is you're still making it look like you're trying to include everything is it trying to appeal to advertisers cuz that's what YouTube kind of feels like they have to do by excluding any even little bit of a controversial thing that happened in the last year but in the mash-up style they're still including hundreds of things every single little thing they can in to try to make everyone happy but the more things you include the more obvious and well-defined those exclusions are so YouTube you can't make everyone happy I think like if anyone could possibly fix rewind or make it better for next year I think change you have to make is you got to leave some stuff out you can leave me out I don't mind obviously I've been in it for a couple years and I love being a part of it I learn not when I'm on the set of a big production like that and it feels good to represent the sort of Tech Community on YouTube that I think what kind of underrepresented but you're going to have to leave some stuff out I really think they should embrace cutting stuff out and and selecting the sort of couple of things that really popped and represented YouTube that year and sort of go back to what made the previous YouTube Rewind so great just my two cents either way hope that video helps sort of understand my perspective the one who was part of the production I know a lot of people who were in it aren't really saying much about it but that's pretty much it so thank you for watching and I'll catch you guys in the next one pause Tech video I promise peace
