for the latest film interviews reviews and everything making news in Pop Culture subscribe to film companion now I don't want my terms in my voice things that can I just begin finally just works in progress perfect sort of way of encapsulating that but here's what I'm really curious about who have been famous for most of your adult life more than half your life every move Priyanka has been sort of there are already three books about you unauthorised books about you out there you have a massive digital we did a quick math and it was 86.6 million followers on Twitter and Instagram what will you reveal in this book that we don't know oh my gosh that's the joy that I've gotten out of writing this is you know there's been so much written about so much extensively written about me as if there's a familiarity to my story but really isn't I've been a public person for more than half my life but this book is it was supposed to be letters sort of to my younger self I was meandering in my idea of what will be but don't have a lot of memories in my life I spent so much time sort of running but I didn't have a lot of memories so I wrote down timelines of my milestones that I remembered and then I built around it I didn't realise there was so much that I dealt with in my life what's on my laurels so it's always like especially in my job which is completely inconsistent like I don't know when my next check is coming in from items in my voice things that I call it the in between interviews book because no one knows what happened no one knows what happens then that's lovely but you know when you say so much that I had to deal with you do have to reconcile things you know coming to terms with things so can you speak a little more about that what kind of things it's not about you know here's me and this is the way to become you know who I became or these are my achievement this book is my journey my trials my tribulations I dissect my dissect my mistakes My Sorrows my grief we've had so many chats over all of these years and you know we've discussed multiple things I've been ferociously protective of allowing you know anyone to scratch below the surface because you know my my inner Circle but now on the other side of 35 you know with my feet firmly planted on the ground I have a sense of self and a sense confidence in my job I have a sense of confidence in the woman I am in the future I'm creating in ability to deliver and I think that made me confident enough to tackle journey that for me was tumultuous it wasn't easy doesn't mean that that's what the world is seen but I wanted to sort of talk about I'm hoping that you know people who read this will get to know me a little bit more as a human instead of the dinner table conversation or the Instagram story that I sometimes become I hope people get to know me girl with dreams and aspirations and someone who sort of built a career on my own back and a self and and now I have the ability to be able to look at myself and say alright you know I went through all of this and kind of this is not some clarification or my play for the world it's just me reflecting and I feel like you know like you said I've been a public person for more than half my life but the consumption of who I has been dictated by other people and has been dictated by the familiarity of who I really am not my work my job not the definition of you know my movies or any of that I'm talking about as a human being I'm consumed as a human introduce myself from the place of being a girl who comes from a very unassuming background and you know sort of normal remember when you first I think it was the first season of Quantico and I think we met in Toronto maybe and I I remember telling you that all of us were so proud because it just felt like you had just shifted the goal post you know you got to the height and then you just move the goal post and created another goal post and and it's it's amazing to me which is when I read that you said that you you've come to this place like you just said to be able to write this book because you felt and you said I was insecure earlier and which made me wonder what were you insecure about swimming in Uncharted territory I've always wanted Uncharted territory when I was supposed to be where or have an academic career you know when I was very young I went to boarding school when I was in 3rd grade I went to America when I was 12 years old it was my decision that I want to go to America to study High School there without my parents and you know so Uncharted territory is sort of always been and even my career for that matter I never went to acting school I didn't and no one in my family has ever acted my dad used to do school plays very Uncharted I learnt everything on the job and the same way it's like when I came to America I mean the fact that I was the first person of South always put in a stereotypical box of what we play and here I was demanding playing mainstream roles and demanding you know saying that I don't want to be defined play ethnicity and that was Uncharted territory completely it's taken me 5 years now to finally be doing a leading but it took like breaking down doors and that's the insecurity when you're trying to go somewhere where there's has become I think within the first 12 hours of being on pre-order it was already a number one best salary how exciting is that I was terrified I can't tell you I'm so scared you know before I could stop the presses this book kind of went into print by the time I realised what's the time I realise how much of myself I'd opened up but it was amazing the sort of see that it went number one and less just sought of started working in than in India and then like in various Terr recorded my voice for most of the stories and you'll see I mean you're a voracious reader but when and if this comes across you you see that are you very long sentences in my writing because that's how I think you know I meander and I think about multiple things so the is really really in my voice and my sense of humour and how I speak so I'm I'm sort of terrified can I help people enjoy the honesty of it honestly how honest were you able to be battered I didn't edit my book in a way of this is something I don't want to talk about or this is something I can not at all if it's play honestly sort of a telling of that Tale behind this movie as an actor as a co-producer even though you a supporting role in this you're not headlining this is adarsh gaurav film I mean he is just brill and and he propels it completely Bollywood move then a Bollywood movie it's not very often in the Hindi film industry that you see things like that happen play something you become more comfortable with after working in the Western what's this Who You Were Always very excited about doing it you know I've always played it's not bajirao mastani my name is not in the title role but you know I was I was very very happy with the work I didn't that movie so I don't like I'm not conventionally trained in thought my thought has always been my own when women not helping female you know female movies so on some trade magazine Hollywood reporter deadline something on Twitter actually and I called my agents it was I remember it's so clear what's happening and I remember I read the book when I said come out where was really looking for an immersive experience you know I've had the Good Fortune of doing such a play rules in my work in Hindi movies and you know big small interesting work with the best directors and be able to play my first job in the US just happened 5 years ago being able to develop some amazing shows in fact I'm doing six shows and like some two movies what's the time in development at the moment I have a second look deal with CBS viacom but as an actor I really didn't so when I called my agents and I said supporting south Asian stor Hollywood you know it was such a struggle for me to be able to forget tell a story with a completely south Asian cast even to be cast as a south Asian in mainstream entertainment and I don't think this movie would have been made 5 years ago with an Iranian with all Indian star cast in India written by an Indian author with this budget it wouldn't have happened but it that's how that was my intention is I want to be at the helm of really influx saying Hollywood with south Asian story south Asian females and I as a producer have that opportunity right now but the acting thing of it actually when I sort of you know figment of his imagination you see pinkie through balram's eyes and I actually wanted to you know the story of the white tiger and we hadn't even cast others at that time when I joined the movie and remain told me about Pinky's role I read I want to feel like I felt the first time I worked with Vishal bhardwaj on kamine I remember the power of coming in and supporting a story with ingenuity with complexity and remaining was the director that sort of pushes you in that direction I had such an immersive experience with it's my first dramatic part you know in in Hollywood and yes it's a supporting part and I've career on supporting parts so I'm not someone who's afraid of you know roles at the length of a role I don't require that to be able tell me though do feel that Hollywood has figured out what to do with you as an actor directly like not with an audition and not with like it just came to me because they were like and it has nothing to do with me being Indian it's just a romantic movie it's you know a great budget great studio and when I first got that offer I sat back and alright you know this didn't require a definition of where I come from it was just a job that has come to me as an act it happened just recently so I think we're out of place you know with the the help of not just me but with a lot of south Asian people who are demanding mainstream but I think it's taken a collective of that demand and I include myself in that to be able to reach a point where you know there is representation in a way but of course we are far away from where it should be but it's there opening in 160 countries around the world and there is such a large cross pollination of Cultures when it comes to consuming entertainment you know I was watching Iranian show the other day escape k-dramas everyday like all day but you know we're consuming content from different parts of the world just cause it's good Korean movie with subtitles won best picture so now what really is a foreign film like that's also a so I think streaming is really changed what Hollywood was and what is going to be and it's going to be really interesting Asian representation in mainstream artistic and like content you know not not as the check in the amazing first look and second look deals and and Hollywood and of course all what you do as a global ambassador for UNICEF all your humanitarian work where does Hindi cinema fit into sing in America for a while as a producer as well because I was just building you know so I didn't I can't come and come at it from a sense of entitlement credits as I can but the problem is I'm still building my career in America so it's taking a little bit of my energy and time will you be able to focus on that it took me 10 years to focus and you know Bollywood eventually be at the place that I was it paddle boats I want to be able to do a Hindi film next year I'm very excited about one of them we're working on scheduling it's with my friends looking at doing a lot of work in India which envelope pushing content for Hindi Hind last year Priyanka was very very tough year for everybody but I felt like the Hindi lost so many fine artists of course massive hit almost an existential crisis of you know what is and what should what happened at what shouldn't happen what sense did you make of it sing it all unravel from the outside how sad from the outside geographically not not outside is this fear of OTT as it's called and or streaming and nothing you know the quicker we jump on that bandwagon the smarter we are theatrical is not going anywhere turn on the experience of is the cheapest form of entertainment in the country and you know you buy a ticket go to Theatre take your family of being able to sit with your family and consume content as soon as it comes out that's not going you're either and the fact that it's opened up doors for us to be able to tell so many different kinds of stories for us to how many different kind of actors than just being limited to the top like 10 that you know we just revolved in movies and I think this is giving us the ability to grow as an industry to be able to take on Talent writers and take a turn on storytelling and I think it's an amazing time and I think it's a time to embrace that it's a time to embrace outsiders people who are coming in to tell different kinds of stories and actually build the industry into a larger table you know inst the walls that we usually had Entourage of 25 people the exact same sort of set of jobs one Team in India and one team in the west is that still operation Priyanka runs it does run with the help of an amazing team I have to say that you know depends very heavily on my team it's not as large anymore it's you know because now I'm kind of figuring out navigate without that much help so it's now a little bit more data my team most of them are the same that you've met along the way but I think the one thing that has changed is I've sort of found my ground a little bit and I have a lot more confidence in myself and being how to deliver and I think my peers with in both the Industries whether it's in Bollywood or Hollywood have kind of also come comes with the fact that you know I do bring something to the table and that's made me have a sense of self and a sense of confidence you know I'm very intentional about what I'm doing what I'm choosing to do what I'm striving to achieve the global domination of it all have sort of left that behind as well I kind of pursue myself as an artist now it's not about it's not a popularity contest for me honestly you know I want to see how I can develop as an artist just like my trajectory in Hindi films add the opportunity to have I want to be able to do that here as well and in a few maybe thank you so much I will be I'm really looking forward to it you please text me once you you always been an inspiration and I've told you this that I remember I think Frankfurt Airport of Berlin airport senior on the cover of one of the US
