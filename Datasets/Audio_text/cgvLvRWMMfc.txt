James Wan came to the franchise with a goal of making each fight feel special come true play blend of Jason showcasing his martial art technique and Hobbes is very straight forward hardcore way a fight one of the things we try to infuse into the fight is a bit of the personal action what both sides wanted to accomplish and what they felt was a good give and take of laser point accuracy wrestling moves obviously and ready and action over the years I've had the opportunity to fight a lot of guys who have great reputations in terms of being Hollywood tough guys and Jason Statham really takes a cake it was very refreshing to bang it out with him and it was very very refreshing to create a credible fight scene
