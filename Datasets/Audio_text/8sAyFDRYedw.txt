parineeti Chopra earrings for you good girl you like to do hair and make-up also listen I am very desperate do mohini so now you do you don't need hair and make a person also now you've learnt your hair and make-up how to do everyday I it was chaotic and that time all that I wanted was home but the grass is always greener on the other side not the moment you get the time at home you want to go out again do you have a routine I can't because I know a lot of people are giving these amazing answers of you know you should keep a routine and it will keep you saying or whatever I'm a very early at 6:07 fast movies that are ready will probably go into so what is the what is the deal Sandeep Aur pinky faraar was ready to release which we were in like 2 days into promotions and then all of this happened a girl on the train is not ready yet they were in the midst of editing and locking Final Cut so weirdly it's a blessing in disguise bet my life on them and I think and but you never know I think Everybody's changing their way of thinking you know more important and critical right now currently but there's the traditional Indian synagogue in me that will say that Cinemas will never die and we would want our films to the lockdown wasn't even officially announced and I remember screaming at my parents one day and I said why can't you sit at home don't you understand for 15 days why and my dad and my mum and 5 Days Later jitsu things changed to such an extent slightly better than this situation because here the entire what is imprisoned in their houses right now with no no deadline we don't know when this is ending you know if somebody told us how do you deal with the anxieties as how do you how do you keep yourself when does business I've actually you know I don't know what what the impression people have of me but I am a very non fill me person like I know even the person right in front of me is film obsessed and but I know is film obsessed and career obsessed and whatever you know people see me as this you know Punjabi all I do is read all day all I do is travel all the time I'm diving and I'm learning new things and I'm I'm actually very which is why when a film doesn't do well it doesn't affect me that performing in front of the camera don't get me wrong but I'm not emotionally real anxiety and fear of you know going badly in their career and you know not doing well for me it's part but what I mean is that I really feel like 50 years from now I will laugh at this that oh I had I spend all my day doing a jigsaw puzzle or reading a book or if my film flops also I learnt from it but I'll I've seen other actors getting have you ever Council decorator going through anxiety and I was telling him myself something I said you know I'm just going to London for 10 days he was like I said no no just personal 10 days we'll just go and spend and waste it so is it what are you mad what do you think I should be doing what what is your instinct about this film's these rules how to go about it you know I don't know if you believe it but I finally learnt who I am as an actor now 8 months ago when I started girl on the train and I literally I think I was just blindly doing information on knowledge and that is that is a failure of mine personally because I wish I was better equ to enter the industry you know I really I was not you know I come from very different world but I realised who I was as an in girl on the train day 1 Scene 1 shot 1 I went to that set I remember and the day next day I finished my hair and make-up also I entered set he he was very like no because come on get to work and I really love that teacher student relationship you give me instructions and do it very well and suddenly everything that I was doing was only for the film I would not waste a single day but it really changed my DNA and now that is why I was saying that girl on the train and sign up whatever their faith is I will really not regret anything because they have sucked everything creatively out of me and I awards on National mentions or whatever but I don't think they were even 1 now I feel like I'm going to enjoy another reason why I want to be
