it's febuary and you know what we haven't done yet a could be episode talking about some of the moments from Indian films that barely make any sense Don't Hold the test of time are aggressive respective let's just get to the video and talk about the shocking moments here is trident refuse Productions embarrassing and regressive Indian movie Scenes that will leave you speechless mehboob Mere mehboob thank you Devizes joshi for recommending sad film in 1992 ramanjit juneja directed a film called mehboob Mere mehboob an adaptation of Heer ranjha story about I didn't love between two people from different villages that have a history of severe hatred for one another how the girl he gets married against her wishes that love despite obstacles ahead of him this movie is filled with some of the funniest Direction and dial every for some reason all the siblings say things at the same time and move like their performing a choreography most of them women have basically bhusa you know there's a fine line between pulling play again sexually harassing someone imagine a random boy in a village coming towards you and doing this the reaction which should be of absolute discussed reminding the man is met with uncontrollable laughter something that would encourage more behaviour like this one two ka four movie Shahrukh Khan many people don't remember is the 2001 film one two ka four it was a movie about a special task force agent and how during the loss of Shahrukh comes across Juhi chawla's character GE who has the strong affinity towards the kids and takes care of the house Shahrukh is a hot headed no nonsense kind of guy so if he feels someone is trying to when he loses his school one moment from the film however that made a jaw drop was the fact that Shahrukh upon finding that Juhi was in one moment the pub and when he comes back home is dressed as if she never stepped out he does this upon thinking that jobless constantly lying rather than being shocked at The Very Thought of someone walking her across the face this is her subsequent dialogue relationship that despite absolutely unacceptable behaviour women only sees a future with the man imagine being so okay with being slapped across the face that it just becomes the norm it's rather scary phool Aur kaante Ajay devgan's debut phool Aur kaante was a massive hit in the box office it was a story that encompassed everything in the 90s Bollywood was known for action romance revenge caricatures villains stunts all the works for a masala entertainer but here discussing the same problem again and again when it comes to movies and how a boy and girl get romantically involved rather than relationships organically sing like sidharth malhotra and Alia bhatt in Kapoor and Sons how Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone metin tamasha conversations which arise due to in the same proximity your group and naturally turns into an infatuation and interest in Poole or can't a however Ajay Devgan sneaks into the hostel and the love interest room and marks every inch of her walls professing his love for her this girl is shocked and borderline mortified imagine coming to your room and seeing these messages from a boy you barely know people is it raining orders for such things it's hardly considered to be cute or charming shaadi karke phas gaya yaar imagine a party setting I've been a misunderstanding between you and your wife she goes on this bender to get smashed in the party because that's the only solution when you are mad at someone rewind looks and horror at her because seeing a woman have alcohol is considered to be the most distasteful thing you can think of dirty confront Salman Khan in front of everyone accusing him that he is set up a lion order to court her that he stole her diary to know every in this mix Shilpa Shetty gets rather personal and obnoxious to which Salman Khan only has my god I haven't seen a bigger run up and Force used to be that convincing try to embarrass you slapping them across the face especially the opposite sex is solution the scene just cuts to the girl weeping with a bruise cheek after the same is that the 90s was quite the decade man like number of films that have just portrayed women as the damsel in distress getting raped or molested leading to public humiliation is quite insane how many this is a perfect idea and it doesn't get any better than this is quite baffling to me responsibility of films affecting the mental space of in the 1991 film is that a girl comes to her brother to tell him that he should put their brother behind the brother feels that this is turning against their own family and that he would never do this the worst explanation the brother gives in justifying his actions Sher Ka insanely idiotic things I have ever heard everyone in this room is now Dumber for having listened to it and I was smashing the like button and subscribing to our channel for weekly content ahead thank you for watching
