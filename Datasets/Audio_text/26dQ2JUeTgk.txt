hot new phone just released announced its the Huawei P30 Pro and this one used to be the camera Champion to P stands for photography I mean you got Pro in the name as well you got like Fox and it's a quad camera setup they are squarely aiming at smartphone Champion status in the camera send Scott a front-facing 32 megapixel camera selfie so a lot of camera Tech inside of here but also other flagship this model in front of me breathing Crystal a 256 gigs of storage and 8 gigabytes of RAM an OLED display it's got a tiny little cut out let's just get into it and see what makes up huawei's latest weather in the flagship smartphone space and I guess figure out whether or not it can be thrown the Samsung Galaxy PS 10 S10 plus that just recently came out because that seems to be what it's kind of targeting here's the color let's check that out whoa that's a color wow it's a bit of a pearl to it there's a kill it into a sky blue type of situation man they got Innovative with the colors you have to admit that you have a USB type-c cable to charge this thing up course it also has wireless charging and Wireless charge sharing just like the bigger mate device that Huawei makes and a quick charge power brick as well okay so let's look around a device real quick you can see Wally has the little red identifier once again on the power switch volume rocker up above their bottom of the device you your sim card tray as well as the type C connector also your speaker unit the other side is completely clean there's like in Edge designed to this to this deal it's a similar to what Samsung is doing but maybe even a little more maybe maybe even more curve to the back of the unit and the front side so what kind of both front and back curved into this Edge it's got a slender feel to it especially for a device big 6.47 in on the display according to Willie do so that's I mean these displays sing huge considering the form factors that they're being fit into this is reminiscent of the essential cutout all it is is a camera lens though so unlike the previous version Huawei devices featured more high-end face recognition Tech similar to what the iPhone is doing they opted for a notch in exchange for just a simple camera to take selfie pictures with obviously okay there's the look Kirk in case you're wondering you get a quick look at the cutout alongside the slim bezel around the whole device bit of a chin there but impressive screen to body ratio nonetheless this is an in display fingerprint scanner it's using optical technology so it's going to illuminate the finger similar to some other products on the market this is a comprehensive scan here when it comes to image-based Face Unlock it's not the most secure form of locking your device so use it at your own risk wow that was quick set of complete holy moly all right we're going to do direct unlock are you ready look for the face boom lows for the face boom I mean there's something so nice about but as I said you just need to understand the limitations with this security method I mean that you don't fingerprint on the other hand let's give that a shot territory right now where you could get used to it and you could live this particular play the notch is Tiny it's barely there you can decide aesthetically how that Stacks up for you compared to the hole punch cut out so there you can see the difference it definitely reaches down farther and therefore it pushes the status bar a little further down as well in the case of the hole punch but it is off to the side so again to each their own it's this collaboration you get the the like a brand name on here now this set up it's just bananas there's so much going on here we have a 40 megapixel camera with a typical focal change a wide angle which becomes obvious given the amount of glass that you see in there and then of course the 5X optically zooming telescopic camera setup on the bottom that's pretty wild and then this other time of flight lens mostly for depth recognition little bit more data information within the photo frame now the AI is picking up that this is a portrait and it's blurring everything else around I don't necessarily want to do this I'm start out now this is 1x so this is just your general 40 MP smartphone camera boom there's photo and this is the 5x that's a huge jump from one to the next it doesn't because you can keep zooming in it just goes digital at a certain point so as you can tell quality on the main shot is very similar to the 5x Zoom then it starts to degrade as you use the digital Zoom to get in closer now all the way down so we can get quite wide here on the widest setting hey this is the most useful extra camera lens situation on any of these smartphones because there are circumstances in which I'm going to take a picture of a group of people that say or possibly some architecture you're traveling and whatnot and I like seeing it on all smart cameras been using it on the S10 used it previous to that on other devices as well and now you know it's here I think it's useful so to give you one more breakdown standard focal lengths 5x optical zoom digital Zoom at 10 x It Go further than that and then of course the wide angle let me turn the AI back on dog it got it can you see that Kirk it knows a dog no see taking pictures of dogs his heart oh he's he's fine look at that what a star you can see various settings here so lots of control if you happen to want it settings for video mode will take you all the way up to 4K UHD and you can shoot an h265 or higher efficiency at that higher resolution more interesting to me is night mode I first check this out on a Huawei device and it blew my mind Once Upon a Time and of course it's still here in the P30 Pro and this I mean this is the lights went out and somehow this thing play she's better than I do right now I'm in Pitch Black and it still sees a plant here look at this is the plant in real life there's a couple of shots merges it together and I mean it makes day out of night it's incredible all right so obviously Lots going on in the camera Department the sheer diversity of ways to interact with the various cameras play the options the manual mode the night mode and so on things are looking promising at the moment selfie camera let's do one whoa It's a detailed selfie ladies and gentlemen are you seeing this right now what is a 32 megapixel sensor this is a realistic-looking selfie like that's what I look like you understand the beard hair test holy moly this thing's doing selfies the eyeball Kirk just had an interesting point he says the notch is not as hidden in the official games like apples trying to do so if you were curious about potential Notch distraction during video watching this should idea of how much it interrupts your video stream it ain't much let's play some music real quick oh boy add some Saturday morning cartoons anyway I mean awesome tunes obviously Ghost Notes the speaker's not that loud I don't know it's not blowing me away or anything like that just doing the trick so what can I say about what are you rocking right there nice little gradient going on the whole unit has five cameras if you include the front one the front one where you saw what it did to my face it's you're very promising I mean it's a good time to be a smartphone fan that's really the takeaway when I see products like this I feel bad for holy smokes from month to month we got play The Notches we got the hole punch OLED everywhere more cameras how many cameras I don't know 10 camera the long range short range right angle portrait algorithms computational photography AI color gradient slim batteries I mention the battery on this 4200 milliamp hours got to get that in I mean I should say this guy's expensive that I should you mentioned that Flagship territory also price wise this is a thousand Euros to start they do have a cheaper the P30 it's only $200 less look out for a video on that it strips down this just a little bit at a and that might be the better deal none you got to pay to play in this department it's an expensive phone that's for sure but you got to admit it's kind of pretty
