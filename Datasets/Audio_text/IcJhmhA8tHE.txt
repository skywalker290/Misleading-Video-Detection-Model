welcome everyone to Q&A time with Pewdiepie for some reason you guys like these thank you God I hate these stories I don't care stop posting them anyway I posted one asking you guys to ask me questions so let's go go to sleep there are new sources that you don't agree with or like but are there any you actually recommend of course this may be Conte I think there's definitely a couple that are are good but I think there's an underlying issue with most of them where it's as turn on these jobs functions the same way as it does for YouTubers where they're paid for clicks on their articles so they're highly motivated to get more people to read the article and that leads to a lot of clickbait at least a lot of hot takes and it makes me wonder what happened to journalism when it used to be sub they didn't have to rely on these tactics that being said why do we have an audience care about any of these sites anyway does it have a News website we give it some sort of voice of authority when in reality most people don't seem to care anyway so I don't know it's like even sometimes when there's a hot take on a website that no one's heard about it but you see that it's a News website so you're like oh my God this is so stupid it doesn't matter I guess my point is I'm over it I don't care no that's not true but I hope people will be as well what are your future goals after YouTube implying there's going to be an after YouTube do you think YouTube will exist let's say I have a career 60 or 65 do you think YouTube in 30 years is still going to be the biggest platform for video content it's not imp if I keep making videos for that long time I don't I don't think of majesty Fun on YouTube or not on YouTube I think my mind is more is if I still want to make videos at that point you don't know the answer to what do you see yourself 20 years later okay here's the question I don't know anyone know that I think I just realized who I am as a person and I am very into the things I like to do right now I still really like to do YouTube but I also think I have a lot more to give which sounds very naive I just feel it myself that I am capable of more things than I'm what I'm doing and sometimes I'm worried that I'm trapped to make the same really kind of videos and not working on bigger things and if I'm not sure if that is holding me back or if that's something I should just keep purs why are you talking much about politics in the last month I don't think I have to have I how do you motivate yourself when you don't want to do something do you have to get it done right down the list that's always the best thing whenever I think I'm stuck and I know I have things to do and I'm procrastinating I always write down a bullet point list of the things that I need to get done today and that way you can start chipping off the easy bits and then you can get it schedule in your head on how you going to make that done make a video make a thumbnail print the video prep tomorrow's video answer emails workout read go home or practice Japanese that's what my day looks like which Youtuber was the most fun to collaborate with I think I have the most fun when I record with Jack you can because we are actually genuine friends obviously it's really fun to go outside and and collaborate with random people it's the kind of thing as a YouTuber your benefit to network right you're better it's beneficial to reach out to people that you wouldn't normally engage with just as a way to broaden your scope of Brandon and all that but I find that to be very I don't like networking I think it's dishonest and play and girls in general what's your actual net worth you've hinted it being higher than Google says and what do you do with that money have invested in stocks or bonds could you give us a brief overview what you do with your money right now it's very messy cuz I'm set up in and UK so I have like four or five companies I have some invested in stocks and bonds but I think overall I don't really spend it anything personally because I don't like having things around me I find it very annoying I think media likes to undervalued me now after I it became more controversial like in the Forbes top list I know I'm higher than a lot of other YouTubers on that list but they I need to put me lower now and that's why I'm saying like it is bigger but at the same time it doesn't matter who cares it's so unimportant I don't know I don't know what's important to me it's not money it's really not I think money for people is like an inch people want it because I didn't know what it's like to experience it and then you have it and you're like actually I feel the same way now when you retire from YouTube would you consider finding a is there something so other YouTubers can reach their dreams like you well surprise I used to have a and that was the idea I realized that there are so many is that I can create a company or do all these things but I don't care it's boring I have the dream job right making YouTube videos that's what I sign up to do because I want to do it for me to go into other businesses would be a lot of time commitment and very boring you have to want it if you want to pursue a business separately and I feel like a lot of times like a hypocrite because I keep saying I don't care about money but I'm obviously still generating a lot of money I'm still selling March I'm still putting minerals in my videos I'm still doing sponsors and it's like if I don't care about money why do I do these things in a way it feels like you're validating your work by making I know that maybe not make sense at all then again the way you make YouTube videos and how successful your channel is ties do how you're making money as well if your video makes a lot of money YouTube is going to recommend that video more as well does that make sense I hope sing 2019 I can start living by my own ideals more does that make sense what's something you wish YouTube would change anything you'd like to play come back put me back in Google preferred YouTube that reminds me actually I think that's why I got so caught up with the I'm I'm looking at myself now but I can understand why I want to make more money because of what happened in 2017 2017 when will The Wall Street Journal article came out my show was canceled I was kicked out of Google preferred getting brand deals was so much harder you know they didn't want to touch me so I wanted to prove okay well you know I don't need to work with big Brands I don't need to be a family-friendly and to make it and to still aren't the same living so I have to be you know I wanted to show that I could do that and that's why I work myself you know I got to work with a lot of cool opportunities still like clutch is one of those companies that were actually loyal to me even though all that stuff happened and that's really cool and other brands as well that I'm really happy I can work with but yeah I think it's gone to a point where it might feel some bit much is why don't you collaborate with videos with markiplier anymore I think our content is waiting different directions people seem to think there's beef between us that's not it at all it's literally just I think we probably have a mutual respect for each other but we don't I have that kind of relationship where we have to collaborate to maintain anything I don't know it's like if you don't interact with someone that means you hate each other that's how people perceive it online the way the audience perceives relationships and how it is in real life is completely my friend from reality and I understand that's hard to understand maybe but it'd be great if people aren't blowing move it up for no reason okay what were the hardest and best moments of your YouTube career and have you always enjoyed the content you make well I'll start with the first one I think both of those things happened this year best moment was obviously the wedding and I got to share that on YouTube but also some of the hardest happened this year as well is melee stuff that I've had to sort of dealt with behind the scenes a lot of things that just it becomes more complicated if you dress it online but I can also be very frustrating because my whole the whole way I've dealt with things on this channel has been I talk about it I address it and I get support for my audience when I do it and and that's a way for me to deal with a lot of hardship that comes with YouTube and then transfer have I always enjoyed the content make it goes up and down I think in general when I find myself not enjoying what I make that's when I try different things and based on you guys what you guys think of it I Go in different directions and that's the fun of YouTube I think that's why it's always changing for me and I'm not doing same things all the time how long do you plan on doing YouTube I've been getting this question so much all the time because yeah I said I'm going to go on a break and because things have started wrapped up for me almost you know I got married I hit 100 million you know it would be a good time just ended on the high and it's kind of annoying almost how people keep asking like as if as if I should quit like when are you quitting are you thinking about I love you too and I think I have more to give I know that's kind of native to say but sometimes I question whether you know if it's possible for me to achieve more by The Format I'm doing now since I'm uploading every single day if it has longevity in the sense of I don't really have days off right now and this year has just been extremely busy it's been the busiest year of my and I've already had extremely busy years before where I practically broke down so I hope I can find better balance for me to keep open YouTube if every year was like it was this year then no I would not do it for a very long what makes you so interested in Japan culture or Japan in general it's like people think you're a weave just because you like Japan anime is like the least thing that interests me about and obviously their culture is so rich and it's so different from the west and I think a lot of their values and and way of interacting fits in with me as well it's hard to just point at one thing and say this is what I like when it's a lot a lot a lot of different things do you still have play passion for making videos as you had 10 years ago how do you reduce or increase I would say it's pretty much the same I think there was more excitement because there was so more growth in the beginning and you go from from nothing to something big and a time but in general I still really liked it because I think I'm still pushing myself to do different things I've been doing like this philosophy type of videos and more of a different style that I'm not used that's beginning a lot of good feedback so that makes me excited to try out different things so I am house Dad doing can you guys please record another try not challenge together you guys a couple goals a lot watching you both being in love watching and love love laughing together and bring us smile my sister doing great I think she did quit YouTube to kind of leave YouTube and she definitely wouldn't mind being play video but I I don't really want to drag her into that Hemisphere and I understand once you left that you don't want to be be back into it that's how I would feel what's 5 left YouTube I wouldn't want to keep being hey guys why don't you play horror games again period do PewDiePie I do play if there's a horror game that's out that's interesting I think I played some Amnesia mod recently and it was like worst performing a video I've done in forever so I know there's some people that want something but in general you look at the bigger picture and it's like I'll do it from time to time if I feel like it but in general it feels like something I've already done once you play enough horror games understand the premise you understand the whole thing and it becomes a bit redundant I I do it mainly I have to wait for Nostalgia at this point it's kind of like play went back to play Happy Wheels all the sudden it's just merely out for the sake of of nostalgia and it has no it has no value yourself it's just repetition which kind of bores me a little bit serious question how does constant media coverage both positive and negative I imagine having your friends family stumbling upon one of your the countless articles written about oneself must be taken a toll on anyone's mental health after so many years stay healthy everyone mental well-being I don't think it affects me would have done in the past it's something in general it's like you cross a line and it's like it doesn't matter you just realize it doesn't matter sing in general they're just digging their own grave at this point and it's just a matter of time where there's going to be a whole new generation that don't believe find their credibility anymore do you see people taking photos of you in secret yeah it happens all the time one of Polish YouTubers said he took a I love you when he was in UK because he didn't want to disturb and I wonder if you see people do that and what do you think about it it's extremely cringy open actually when I was in Italy now some guy did this and then the flash went off and I'm just like really it's super cringy I hate the fact that people look at me like I'm some sort of Attraction I'm a person like everyone else and I want to be treated like a person I don't think that's too much to ask I hate the whole culture of you I'm so tired of it and that's why I said if you meet what you have to say is is math related to science because that's how I know if you're a cloud chaser or if you or if you when 19 year old the way people react what I found in different countries is very different right if you go to do you like Malaysia and Singapore people are very hectic and screaming and crazy and they lose their mind if they see you and they do all crazy stuff and then you look at countries like when I go back to Sweden people are more like me more reserved very polite and calm and just and and more I would say a lot nicer about it which I really really appreciate so that makes me think the whole way people react isn't just like play natural reaction of being nervous it's just like a trained reaction of okay so this is I'm so how I'm supposed to act if I see a famous person can you complaining about it isn't like that I'm fed up with it it's more like I want to change it I love meeting fans don't get me wrong but I also want people to just treat me normally as well and I don't like when people scream I don't like when people get freaked out and I understand you get excited that's not what I'm talking against I think where is like a culture to treat people like they are more than they are and that annoys me but to answer your question take volume 4 0 6. 0 0 6 borderline comma it seems like they are making steps to improve towards edgy content I've seen them do that with the with advertisers YouTube let's have to face with a lot of with the reality of backlash that comes from the media that is inevitably going to affect their advert that is so difficult position to be in to sort of look at the bigger picture but then at the same time you have a website that's for cre but the craters needs advertisers I wonder if YouTube just had the balls to just stand their ground how that would affect it because they are they are essentially in Monopoly I will say I think it's obviously complicated and in a lot of ways I I understand YouTube it at the same time I think they made decisions in the past that are so anti YouTuber that I wonder it's going to take them a lot to come back to a better point with the community I think and I think if you two wants to have longevity even if they do Monopoly they need to get that back nothing is forever you know that they could easily become another website in the future I don't see that as an imposs you taking up many other passions beside YouTube such as making video games what would be another passion you would like to take up I think music could be fun to I know that's really cliche that's like what a lot of YouTubers do but I think it could be a fun medium for me to express a lot of ideas and thoughts that is hard to put into words in a video I think your music could be an interesting medium to to do that will you make more philos videos like that I hate Twitter video yeah I will definitely make more I have some stuff I've been I sort of just let it Sim back of my mind whenever I feel like thinking about something so I just make it when it comes natural light I try not to force it how do you deal with a lot of alone I think the important bit is to understand that everyone is supposed to moron no I I'm joking but it's also true but only because do you always have to be honest with yourself and see okay if someone says something that is making me feel a little uncomfortable because maybe there's some truth in it that I think I'm going to address that and and use that as constructive criticism but I think once you get something that is Shirley stupid with no logic behind it or constructive feedback behind it and yeah I treat everyone like they're an idiot which a lot of people are the smartest and dumbest thing ever I don't remember if I answered it this way but if you could change something this what would you change if anything definitely try and find a better balance between work and time off what do you like so much about Japan you are moving there is it being able to walk around in public without getting recognized there's a lot of things that I like about Japan it's definitely not only that definitely a plus it's one of the few Asian countries where I can actually move around and not get recognized which is very liberating because every time you if I can't draw the distinction if they are a genuine fan and if they're just someone that thinks you're famous that's where are the kids Felix oh boy so for years and years and years people have been pressuring me and Marcia to get we come from us and you shouldn't come from like I don't want to be pressured about it is no stop it's like I say the smallest thing like oh we're going I'm taking a break and people like he's going to make baby or like I don't know if you had the choice between Amnesia and Minecraft what pink Minecraft obviously do you think your content gets better or worse compared to let's say 2017 do you think you try more or less when making a video compared to that time I probably try more because the videos kind of have to be a little longer now so it does make it a little bit more complicated before you can just record like 10 minutes and cut it down to a 5-minute video I think the main thing I noticed with all the videos is the voice my voice is so I hope I finally found a voice that actually my voice I hope in 21 I look back at now and I don't cringe yeah I don't know why you look depressed for real please tell us why do I look depressed no I'm not I think mainly I'm just frustrated I think so much happened this year that I didn't take time to process and it's also reason of this break I think how did you overcome video awkwardness and what was your motivation when you started making videos that's funny how you mention that cuz it was very awkward to make videos the first time you do it it's like a weird thing to speak into a microphone or a camera it's not normal it takes just keep doing it and you'll get over it my motivation was to just create my own path and find something that I like I felt very trap doing what something that I didn't enjoy I think I'm extremely fortunate to have broken out of that the fact that I was able to turn YouTube into a profession was was my dream it still is I'm so happy I can do a job that I genuinely enjoy doing the only thing like this to summarize this whole video is like I love making videos but being at the Precision I am it's way more than simmer down a little bit simmer down and next year I can take some time to fully process bottom of it as well and that's it for this Q&A hope you guys enjoy listening to me rambling about boohoo my life so hard say bye-bye hey Google now you are entering a new era but you shall crafts that own poop the hour of fox Spanish rock crawlers is all about that hey Google
