hey what's up guys I'm keeping HD here at Samsung's unpack in San Francisco for Galaxy Z flip so when do this one was coming when you were going to get article folding phone from Samsung of some kind there is plenty of leaks out there and then we finally got it and now that I've had my hands on my feelings are very mixed very mixed so I've held this phone now in my hands for maybe half an hour and add fleeting moments with it on and off for a bit longer than that and on one hand it feels like it's easily the most polished and mature phone yet but on the other hand it still has a long way to go to be something I would actually buy and it still has its I mean unlike the Moto Razr let's just what it is I'm going to be comparing it a lot to the other folding flagship phone the razor does not have Flagship specs but the Z it does it's got the Snapdragon 855 Plus 8 gigabytes of RAM 256 gigs of storage and a combined 300 milliamp hour battery which is okay and it still has wireless charging which is nice and you've got dual cameras here 12 megapixel standard and a 12 megapixel ultrawide these specs on paper pretty much wipe the floor with the razor I'll just I mean you can't help but compare the two maybe leave a thumbs up on this video if you want to see a separate dedicated razor versus Z you can see they've made some different design and material choices that make it a very different turn on the main one being the screen so this is now an ultra thin folding glass not plastic and you can feel when swiping around and using the screen it's not a soft plastic that you can almost literally dig your fingernails into its glass so what's a great advancement it's hard it's a 6.7 inch 21/9 display 1080p OLED 60 and it has that hole punch cut out for the selfie camera up top instead of a notch and much thinner bezels so all these things make it feel do you like more of a Samsung Flagship than any other folding phone but the Kris the Kris to me is still major I saw it from many different angles I used it for many different things and there's just no way around it it's a very noticeable yes I would say it's better than the original Galaxy fold but here's the thing since this is a vertical folding phone and the same thing goes thanks for the razor because it's vertical folding the crease is across the center here and that means every time you use the phone anytime you do any sing running short of using the UI you're constantly moving over that Center Kris and you're constantly constantly feeling Center of that fold with your finger so unlike a horizontal folding phone you really noticed it a lot here and you can feel it when your fingers swipes over it over and over and over again now I still prefer it to the razors plastic display because that one feels a bit more delicate and softer but I'm not going to sit here and tell you the crease is gone or anything I mean you can clearly see it and then when we close the phone the front cover display 1 inch 300 by 112 display on the outside of the fold and really all is good for is the time and seeing a little preview of your notifications some people like me maybe fine of a little extra functionality on the outside like the razor has so you can actually go into your notifications and read stuff like texts and emails put in the Z flip it'll it'll just tell you you got a text or who it's from and really if you want to open it or actually do anything you have to unfold the phone but also if you double tap the power button you can actually open the the primary camera and take are you with it and use that 1 inch cover display as like the world's most hilariously tiny viewfinder it's there it's and you can use it I guess but I probably won't I think most people will take selfies with the normal selfie camera because of the final major design update I don't think this can be overstated hinges are extremely important for folding phones and learning from your past hinges to make better ones is going to be something we start to see and I think Samsung learned a lot already from their first gen Galaxy phone and the things that went wrong with it and we can already see that here in this second generation hinge the Z flip has a really good hinge I'd say the best hinge I've seen yet it's nearly gapless and Samsung says it's put a bunch of small fibers like a like a brush inside change to give it even more protection from anything accidentally getting inside it still might not pass the Jerry everything pour a handful of Pebbles Direct turn on the phone test but it is another step in the right direction and then the hinge wait is also really nice I feel like I can open this phone one hand much more easily and it's a three-step hinge meaning you can fold the phone halfway like a little laptop and turn it down on a flat surface and it'll just sit that way letting you use half the screen at a time and then if you've been built in some of their apps to take advantage of this including the camera and the gallery and even Google's Duo video calls now I didn't get an answer on if this is an open API and other helpers can you know change their apps to use this fold to but it would seem like a no-brainer like taking advantage of having a hinge that's this impressive and keeps the phone this well-balanced from tipping over would be great so that's three major ways that the Z flip is differentiating itself there's a lot of ways better than some other folding phones the cover display on the outside it's different the specs and the build quality and that hinge what are small things I noticed of the fingerprint reader is on the power button right below the volume button so kind of like they did with the Galaxy s10e I like and no there is no headphone jack sorry if you thought they would be one and the bezels are pretty thick at first but the more you use the phone the more you realize they're necessary for protecting the glass when you close it like the screen sits just barely sub flush so can you close the phone you're not slamming glass into glass here closing bezel on bezel so yeah overall I'm very curious what you guys think of the Z flip to me it's really fascinating but it has to be a little more than just fascinating to be worth 1,380 we thought it might be a little bit cheaper those rumors of it undercutting the razor started to Bubble Up but no it's 80 bucks but I still can't wait to review this thing I want to see the battery life is like with the 3300 milliamp hour battery and a giant screen I want to see how the durability just by using it for a couple minutes but I don't know I'm just I'm glad folding phones actually evolving as fast as they can maybe who knows in three or four generations will have the incredibly Sleek thin what's 120 HZ awesome folding devices iPad sized screens in our pockets that's all a big maybe but that's what what we're working towards either way thanks for watching this first Hands-On and impressions of the Z flip and if you want to check out the other videos of the Galaxy s20 lineup that also just got thanks for watching catch you guys on the next one piece
