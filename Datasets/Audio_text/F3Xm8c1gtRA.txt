do all Gamers think the same well today we find out when ninja said Jubilee uploaded this video do all Gamers think name the premises that you have a bunch of Gamers and they go to the left or to the right depending on how much they agree on an issue Reg gaming I'm a gamer so let's freaking do this it's a joke but I think there's just a lot more stuff that they have to these are not my real opinions I'm just making jokes Spectrum that's what all gamers are on get it that's one thing Gamers have in common that was a joke another joke why do I keep making them I am Ariana Grande's girls can also game I play Halo competitively also shows escape and OverWatch nice well done Jubilee you really sure that oh God what is conception is how much work people actually put in there's a lot that goes into it a lot of people you know have negative finally let's play along okay I like energy drinks you guys can play along all right so left side is agree sorry right side is agree left side is disagree I would probably call myself here because I drink energy drinks all the freaking time check out G fuel enter the code PewDiePie play jumping he's definitely going to go for it I'm sorry can you give me a second to think about this this is that is not a tough question God oh God please baby energy drink will help you figure it out 50/50 drinks with alcohol is not super unhealthy really bad and people actually die from that I definitely acknowledge the health risk that some energy drinks have but for me I mean not if you're drinking no health risks enter the code PewDiePie I don't know if I can say that yeah sure I am sure I can say that Non-Stop play at the top of my game and it helps out a lot gaming culture is massage what's a woman I need a definition of that what's a woman tell me right now all right this will be interesting okay left or right agree or disagree we can already I don't know where I would go I probably go somewhere here just so I can now go here cuz anytime can I see a girl play a video game and they say they play Halo competitively in reality I just imagined that they're really just playing RuneScape and how much does weather in contradicted can I have the definition of everyone like what does that mean as soon as we speak we get called fat we called all these ugly names it happens to me all the time as soon as I speak fat I get her point I get her point a terrible thing to experience I have a girlfriend that streams though so I feel like I've gotten more open-minded what's the definition of what a girlfriend is it about it and understanding and I can definitely understand that that's a funny joke from people just saying dumb dumb jokes over and over it's like oh why do you care but it's like it's so run to the ground a lot of the people say to girls online that is I'm a competitor like I don't care about what my gender is what how much I play I don't care about any of that like if I'm good enough like then I'm good enough I just don't really believe in the I think that's a fair doesn't mean that you want to be in and acknowledge that in a way it's like how do we fix these issues well maybe just don't bring it up all the time I don't know no guy can I disagree with that and like I do agree that the skills speaks for itself I agree with the skills speaks for itself also disagrees with harder to succeed as a woman than it is as a man there's no doubt that the experience will be different the difference is different I think there are there's just a lot more they have to deal with so like back then you know arcades in the first like home cons you did that what the hell don't protect your ideas don't forget your misogynistic history and other compensate for everybody going over there I think it's the 90s video game encourage Bible 3220 someone agreed pick up they were inspired by video games but I just think anyone who who has those kinds of issues is going to find that inspiration from any kind of medium including you're basically saying that all of these things are encouraging it it's kind of disingenuous to say that video games doesn't and at least play encourage it hit me up I finished thought because any medium will inspire you in a way doesn't mean it encourages I would say I just think it's disingenuous to say that because we they do these things that you can't argue against that but I think the argument that putting video games in a specific box saying okay well it's their fault that's completely pointless and doesn't solve any issue whatsoever does that make sense I didn't think there would be controversial topics Jesus Christ there's so many of us to play video games that don't have those kind of thoughts how would it it's like you said it's just a scapegoat what okay good for traditional Sports you have to push your body to such lengths to be able to do those physical fees to be the best whatever I just don't think that play basketball but I don't think that they're working on like frames per second kinds of levels of reaction and speed basketball players they will never understand the frames per second he strongly agrees and then you know not all sports are as intensive as like football we're pretty much we pretty much put out the same amount of physical work I meant a lot of people that are professional Esports and I know it's highly demanding but I don't think physically it's the it's the same thing darts what was the question Competitive Gaming is just demanding as a physical sport a physical sport when people say physical sport they generally not talking about 32 make one cup can you turn on throw everyone off their game he's waiting for this one yeah childish but trash talking is super fun I do it a lot play you can understand my tone these women calling us virgins all the time it's not fair it's not play family skeptical about career okay let's see they're very deep why does it say oh it's Instagram poll oh okay I was wondering why that was different all the time and after I graduated high school I asked for a chance I was like hey can I have just a year I want to really see if I can make this work you know I want to pursue my screen yes your parents for a it's so fun judging people that are just throwing since that's not thinking about it and then I can go get idiots I've never said anything stupid in my life it wasn't even parents will be no no even more you're welcome so yes probably strongly disagree can you stop being contrarian in every Point depends on what you have to find a good living I live in Silicon Valley in the Bay Area the highest cost of whatever this Competitive Gaming career have is it's a side hustle and then move it somewhere else it's not a good job because play living expensive area one of those by itself I would not make it I used to live in a trailer with my dad in Ohio so I understand the struggle you know I used to sleep on the mattress on the floor you know gaming I started streaming I started you know getting a lot of attention and then tournaments I was making a lot of money there I mean now I live in like in a really nice part of California like rent-free with my girlfriend and there's a lot of money to be made in gaming whether it's streaming YouTube tournaments sponsorships the World Cup 30 million like there's just ridiculous on you know the reason why I'm not on strongly agree is because it's so unreliable 8 months I'd say I make a really good living I think that fortnite has given me a lot of opportunities I mean the viewership and the the prize winnings alone is ridiculous I mean even for me I've always just like the YouTube like oh yeah it's pretty unreliable job I probably shouldn't 321 go get all of them because they only play video games all day big surprise I brought my DS to class and people were like oh that's a cute little console why you play games I went to real struggles I don't understand how times have changed huh have times
