hey what's up guys MKBHD here and this is the full view of the Samsung Galaxy S7 so there's a phone that's similar a lot of ways to its predecessor the one that came before it which would be the Galaxy S6 so the easiest way to talk about this phone and to completely understand it is to look at all the differences between it and the one that came before it so this is everything you need to know that's new and different about the Galaxy S7 so first of all call the body is slightly different it's slightly upgraded and most people hear that to me and it got thinner but this phone is actually slightly thicker and I'm calling that the up one a much smaller camera bump on the back and two a much smaller home button / fingerprint reader bump on the front actually had a lot less accidental home button presses with this phone so that's nice and the phone is still pretty thin but the extra space inside is packing a much 3000 milliamp hour battery so that's pretty important and then they focused on the shape and the handle a little bit more so the edges are less sharp the is it easier to pick up and hold and the back glass is more rounded on the sides like the Galaxy Note 5 and then the rest is all the same premium materials last year so Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back and then metal rails on the sides and really nice buttons I don't think Samsung gets enough credit for how nice the they pretty much have the power button and volume buttons on point so probably get the idea that the build is slightly improved but still very familiar like this is definitely still the slippery is phone I've ever held or used alongside the Note 5 like this has slipped out of my pocket while sitting incremental improvements from last year okay the next difference is play p68 this phone is now totally dust sealed and water resistant so you can use it in the rain or in your pool or at a flaps or anything over the USB ports or the headphone jack I love that the design stays the hit as it gets waterproofed here the one downside is definitely the speakers the speaker suffer massively here pretty sure the Galaxy S7 just got the biggest downgrade of any speakers on a smartphone they're now way tenure and more distorted sounding and you can blame that fully on the waterproofing so the Galaxy S7 also got the MicroSD card slot back I did not expect that to actually happen I threw that out there you're in an older like predictions video as a sort of a Oddball feature that might happen but you do actually have it now you do have expandable storage in the Galaxy S and of course you can't have a new flagship phone without all your new flagship specs and you get all of that here so in the US that's the Snapdragon 820 adreno 430 and 4 gigabytes of RAM and performance is definitely up to Snuff to match this is a really quick and snappy phone and like the Galaxy S6 was and we're getting much improved RAM management as well that's big here I'm glad to see this phone handle multitasking that that's better than its predecessor which kind of occasionally had issues holding apps and Ram with metal and glass it still does get a bit warm even with the new internal cooling but nothing too severe just a little warm to the touch when you're gaming for a while or doing some heavy browsing but just with everyday use it's fine wireless charging heats up a bit but I'll talk about that later so yeah this phone is fast again that's one of its biggest strengths and definitely one of the biggest reasons to get it so the ask but not least actually the biggest difference with the new S7 is the new camera this new 12 megapixel camera this is my favorite camera on any smartphone right now and that's putting it on top of a very good heap of other smartphone cameras out there and I got to say there's no shooter that consistently makes me feel as confident as a photo and video taker as the Galaxy S7 and that's what really makes a good photo experience for me so camera app opens with that double tap of the home button really quick from anywhere again super fast and it's immediately ready for a shot there's no shutter lag or it's very quick to just grab a photo and a lot of people look at the new 12-megapixel photo number and think oh wait that's less megapixels last year it's not a big deal 12 megapixels is still plenty and these pixels are now larger which along with the optical image stabilization 1.7 aperture should help a lot with low light should the photo quality in auto mode is again play typical Samsung so very bright Punchy colors lots of saturation and contrast and sharpening they've been doing this forever so edit one thing it's more notable is that F 1.7 aperture makes it so easy to blow backgrounds out of focus even in broad daylight with call subjects if you get close enough to the subject you can get that blurry background which is pretty crazy and the new dual pixel autofocus handles the shallow I'd say the biggest weakness is it tends to over EXP a bit in daylight conditions there are definitely more blown highlights than Crush Shadows although throughout the pictures I've taken it's actually not the rest in low light here's an example of the exact same picture I took on the Galaxy S7 versus my Nexus 6p now Nexus is you can always have the best image processing but it clearly beats the S7 here so I would have liked to have seen I guess less grain from the S7 camera and light and a little bit more control exposure during the day here's the thing though that autofocus is the best part of this new camera and play Crazy Fast also in video mode it's just as fast making this pretty much the ideal for high quality video if you want to shoot 4K video can the easiest possible way guarantee usable footage this phone is the one to have overall the fast autofocus combined with is Aperture and the fast camera app make this the fastest smartphone camera alongside the iPhone and it's a pleasure to use for that 5 megapixels and also an F 1.7 aperture and an even wider angle than the it's not quite as sharpened or oversaturated but it takes a pretty good selfie if you're into that so there you have it a couple of incremental but important changes that make the Galaxy S7 a different Beast plus I guess all the things about the Galaxy S6 that are already pretty great the best display in any smart volume to 5. 1 6 second only to touch ID and some quick charging and wireless charging of a new larger battery and the actual life for me with a larger battery was play impressive to I would give myself like a B+ or a - 4 as far as how long this lasts during the day pretty much never have to charge it before the end of the day and I was getting somewhere between 5:00 to 5 and a half hours of screen on time typically which is a big improvement over the notably bad battery of the Galaxy S6 so that's something I was really excited to see and you also still have fast charging you still have wireless charging you still have fast it's charging it does get a little bit warm to the touch when your wireless charging but other than that pretty much no complaints about the new battery I was definitely not perfect it still has its flaws in the entire video about that and if you want to watch that it'll be linked in this corner or below that like button and it's missing a couple things you know it doesn't have an IR blaster people were confused about the dropping of that it's also like I mentioned the slippery is phone ever and definitely looks and feels better with a case or even you're a nice skin on it plus you kind of hide the fingerprints and make it easier to hold I'll link the dbrand skin below I think that Matt looks clean still not everyone's favorite software so this Samsung skin on top of Android obviously since his Android you can still go to town with the skins and custom launchers and really make it your own but someone like me will do that within minutes of setting it up someone who's not really into it might take a while and might I like it out the box but overall I really like this phone some of the little stuff that used to be third-party apps Samsung is picking up on it and building it into their own software so stuff like the always on display is a nice touch so for example since it's always an AMOLED display you can choose to always have a clock calendar or still image when the phone is sleeping and it avoids burning by moving around the display periodically doesn't burn too much it would be cool to have that always on I'm not sure why you'd want a still image but hey there's always that so if you don't find it on day one then you'll probably find it a little while down the road after I'm using this phone for a while but at the end of the day the big question is is this galaxy S7 worth the upgrade over whatever phone you have now if you have something like Galaxy S6 or even a high-end phone from last year it might not be worth all the changes the couple of things you do get if you're really really into video this is the best video camera on a smartphone now and if you're really into having a better battery life this is definitely a better battery life than the Galaxy S6 but if you're going to upgrade if you have to and you're not really sure I would at least opted for the Galaxy S7 Edge which is a little bit bigger but you also I got those Edge features and you get them even larger battery for even better battery life overall a pretty well-rounded experience no pun intended that thanks for watching this review video hopefully enjoyed it feel free to give it a thumbs up if you do and I'll talk to you guys in the next one piece
