hi I'm Deepika Padukone I'm an actor producer and philanthropist I'll be opening up subscribe to the Bazaar channel so you don't miss an episode another important aspect of of being still and and being in the movie business is fashion so I think most obviously in my little black book today I take you through move my thoughts on fashion and and what that means to me I was a model before I became an actor but before that I was a bad play but we'll talk about that another time modelling happened to me really in a way that I didn't expect so pay attention my close friends mother was and still is one of the most respected and successful modelling agents apparently she always tell my mother that I should become a model but it was through Anila that I did a couple of campaigns as a child just for the exposure and just for some fun I went first solo holiday when I was 16 and when I came back it's that time in your life when your parents sit you down and ask you what I want to do with your life and at this point I was a professional badminton player so this is when I said to them I said I don't want to pursue badminton anymore that I would seriously like to pursue modelling and acting I think it was that experience that then read me for the movies so very very important part of my play fashion in style evolution you know I think the first person who had a huge impact on my life is Anita shop she's been a stylist with me for many many years and along the way I also met through her Selena who's been playlist now for the last couple of years my first film was lava article which the pic I was in so when I started working in the industry that's how my journey with her started I started working 6 7 years ago we know what the event what we want to look like for that event the most important is how the pictures that we take for the fitting when she likes something she's always smiling if she's not sure about something sure expression is a bit different and so I know what she likes I personally feel like it's changed over time so when I started it was entire house in her bag anytime you need anything it can be medicine it can be a scissor it can be needle and thread I need anything and she will have it now I feel she's started experimenting like when she goes out and shop she'll really interesting pieces great pieces of course but interesting and I I'm also like oh I mean I never thought you'd buy this I just bought this because I thought it was nice so she's a little conscious to show me what she's bored which I think is amazing her style is evolved open the experimenting trying new things she always says you know it should be fun it's something we should enjoy we shouldn't take it over the years exposure to magazines or or social media even movies and through the characters that I've played I think really allowed me to understand and embrace fashion in a very very different way so nothing seems strange I believe that my inherent style is just simple and classic and eel having that exposure to the modelling world and also being an actor has really allowed me to play with with fashion and not really is autistic myself anymore it's kind of what it's evolved into over a period of time the I mean certain things that we've been working with an hour bright pop colours maybe bright pink and blue and a lot of her looks have been like a lot of the designer really enjoyed wearing most recently was the neon green giambattista Valli gown and in general I feel like I love the work that he's doing it's it's large and it's vibrant and it's colourful and I feel I'm going through a phase where I really enjoy that I have to say it was a lot of pressure this year because last year we did a pink Ash what are we going to do to make it bigger in every way like in size in how it came together like when it was travelling it was still huge after it got end and opened out it was hanging from the ceiling and it's still wasn't fitting in the room and her reaction when she entered the room was like oh my god like it it was humongous like it was not even I couldn't believe how big it was you know in the moment of it will look fantastic I think the beauty power relationship is that we get each other we understand each other we've become very very close friends and and today it's not just about work but it's about comfort and I can look at her I'm not look at her and she'll understand exactly what I'm thinking of feeling I think those are the relationships that I you know look forward to the most in my life because you know we've started from somewhere we almost sort of started our together and she was an assistant to see her revolve in in front of my eyes to see her growth and to see her Revolution makes me happy I feel like the journey with her is what I value the most
