folding smartphones are all the rage and there's a bunch of different options now almost none of which you should probably actually buy do I mean we have the Galaxy Z flip from Samsung we have the Galaxy fold the Moto Razr and then sort of the rest you know everything from the TCL trifold concept phone to the Royal Flex pie and you may have seen another story floating around of another folding phone buy Escobar yeah that Escobar just a little filler in on the Escobar name if you're not familiar with the Escobar was Colombian drug lord ended up being known as basically the wealthiest criminal and history from monopolizing cocaine trade into the United States for fun fact he died of a gunshot wound to the Head the day before I was born so you know this isn't exactly a positive sentiment around what's the name like being known for the killings of police officers and politicians and making Columbia the murder capital of the world not the best what's way to have your name known but it is a no name like y'all have heard of Escobar so now suddenly on every Tech website there's can you folding phone with the Escobar name on it seriously and it's getting a lot of eyeballs turning a lot of heads very interesting and it's 350 bucks and looking at the actual phone it is a curious one it's a gold accent which is if you study the specs or the design long enough at all you literally realize it's just a royal Flex pie with a 2019 I spent my 350 bucks free shipping and placed my Escobar fold order something a lot of people think about this channel is that like I get everything for free and while it's true that I get review units and I will make first impressions videos with those I end up buying pretty much everything that's why I haven't reviewed the Moto Razr folding phone yet for example cuz I sent the review unit back that's what I did the first impressions with and now the one that I bought spend delayed by several weeks so anyway I didn't reach out to Escobar Inc I didn't even think to ask if they had a review program I just I quietly bought one that was in December and yeah I never got it I mean I guess I shouldn't be Sur it was a little suspicious to begin with I mean you looked around their website and it is it's a little suspect there's some pretty wild pictures and statements trying to sell you this phone some pretty bold claims and it's just overall not the most professional looking I really ever going to get this phone like I put down the money in the off chance I was surprised and then that would be kind of funny but when I put my order into the tracker it never updated from pending pending it just sort of said it was we were sharing some other pretty cool stuff at the time it's sort of when do the radar it was just lost money that's sort of where I thought it would end but then we saw a headlines of another new Escobar fold phone it was it was the Escobar fold 2 and once again there are articles there were headlines they were even some videos of this new thing a 400.00 Escobar folding phone that looks like this I got an email from Escobar Inc just asking mailing address like what's your mailing address at that point I was again like sort of genuinely interested but after they wanted to guarantee a video by sending it to us and I I wasn't willing to commit to guaranteeing a play just from them sending a phone that's not something we do so they ended up not sending one but but I I did buy a second one because apparently I like giving money away to anything tech-related so maybe if you guys want to buy the merch and support we don't worry about this so much but I bought another Escobar fold 2 so I still didn't have the first one I went to their site and bought the second one under a different name so now I've given them 750 free shipping both times and I've gotten nothing I didn't get one and neither did many other people but then videos started popping up and I've had this happen before where I declined something in my inbox some opportunity and then a week later I see a bunch of videos about Play on YouTube in my sub box etcetera so this is one of those things I was curious about because the product isn't that great but the company behind it and the schematics behind it are so weird so I tweeted this 0 out of 10 would recommend didn't get the phone both times I ordered but then that night believe it or not when I got home from the studio to how much is the shipping address that I put in for my first order guess who's waiting for me at my door Escobar fold box so on 24th which is like 4 days after this this tweet and the Box showing up I got an email saying that they upgraded my fold one order to a fold two which I guess I believe because it had my name minute from the first order I placed and it went to the shipping address of my first order I placed and other people have gotten the same upgrade open who who also happened to be tech reviews the only reason I'm talking about this is because it's based around a tech product like I talk text but if this was happening with like a kitchen appliance product or some makeup product or something else like that probably wouldn't have cared nearly as much but because it's Tech and they really seem to be trying hard to make it seem like a great phone to buy okay well that's what made it so fascinating to me and within about 30 seconds of using a phone and no I'm not putting my SIM card in it but from using the phone just for a little bit it's pretty clear this appear be a legit Samsung Galaxy fold and the new one at that so I have my regular Galaxy fold here with the dust caps on the hinges and the new slightly stiffer hinge and everything and this Escobar fold it's the same phone with a dick or glued to it gold tin foil adhesive to it you take a bit of that gold off of the hinge on the back and right underneath is that Samsung logo right is it supposed to be and the gold foil comes off the back with a box cutter or a knife or really enough heat to melt the adhesive so it's not pretty but yeah it is an actual Galaxy fold fully working minus any of the stuff that normally comes in the box and it's a really an Escobar fold 2 you're really just reviewing a Samsung Galaxy fold with a gold sticker on the back and some weird pre-installed mugshot wallpapers but the Galaxy fold costs $1,800 and the Escobar fold 2 costs so how are they pulling this off well it's not just the lower quality packaging it's not just the lower quality marketing my theory is that they are going through orders finding the names of YouTubers or most people in Tech Media or people who they think will talk about the phone if they get it and shipping those and then just not cuz I had my name attached to it and why they upgraded me and shipped mine out they were probably hoping I would speak pretty literally about it that's why I tweeted what I did but if you really want to get into it they tell everything on their site so the two main people in what are these two guys Roberto Escobar so Pablo Escobar's older brother and chief of assassin and this other guy Olaf Gustafson who is the CEO of look like mugshots maybe that's their Cool vibe or whatever but there's a Twitter account behind this tech savvy dude who's just convinced this older guy he can use the Escobar name and make them lots more money from it so he's he's tweeted all these articles and tons of photos of celebrities somehow and he seems very proud of any you can get including when he also cloned the boring company flamethrower and try to get Elon to stop selling his and when he what's Mr Escobar start a cryptocurrency that didn't exactly work out but the marketing for the Escobar fold is easily the best so if you go to the YouTube channel which is truly incredible I'll link it below it currently has about 14 videos on it including a video panning back and forth across five fold phones maybe all that they've made at that time there's an unboxing video that I'm pretty sure if I show more than about three more seconds of it it's going to get this video demonetized they have a video called Rip Samsung cam where they take a bunch of non-rem branded original Galaxy folds out of the box and then put safety Nexus on but no other protective clothing and then just starts smashing Galaxy folds with sledgehammers and if you look it up if you go to rip samsung.com which is in the title and this whole this point the Escobar guys bought that URL and they have a redirect to Escobar inc.com which is crazy is this phone wouldn't exist without Samsung phone and then there's two other endorsement videos so I guess this is really how you make sure you sell a lot of phones from Chris Hansen and Anna Anka versus Predators and To Catch a Predator I just I wanted to tell you all that I've seen this amazing new smartphone called the Escobar fold 2 it appears to be the best phone out right now I've been looking at the transcripts so have a seat check it out and remember Escobar full two smartphone is a really really incredible Innovation from amazing people in Stockholm Sweden I hope you guys will enjoy it and use it a lot lots of love by celebrities are on a site called Cameo which is where you can send requests and pay 50 or 100 bucks or so add a personalized video in return I'm pretty sure videos on the side are typically like oh have a Arnold Schwarzenegger say happy birthday to your and or something I doubt that these two people even know that their videos are being used to help promote just focusing on the final product the finished thing should you buy it we've reviewed already it's the Galaxy fold I've talked about it it just has gold tin foil on the back the interesting part now becomes the behind-the-scenes part which is the company that's trying to maybe sell some of them and also not ship most they're trying to scam you it's one of those situations where you know you have to take any preferential treatment you might get with a gigantic add salt so I guess the lesson we've learned is there are way way way way way too many cases of people not getting are Escobar fold for me to ever recommend you ever buy anything from this company so don't don't buy an Escobar fold 2 if you want a Galaxy fold it is very pricey but I also typically don't recommend you buy one either and and just for your own safety of money play don't buy anything that any of these guys are associated with at all I took the hit so you don't have to there you have it if you want and ask a review watch my Galaxy Fold review I've already done it link below the like button if you want to check it out that's pretty much it that's the truth thanks for watching catch you guys the next one piece
