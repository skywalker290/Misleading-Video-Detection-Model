yeah can you hold on one second I just got a I got to unfold my phone real quick I feel like every week we get a new rumor that Samsung Galaxy fold is about to relaunch like it's coming soon it's passed the tests they finished the redesign it's about to launch again it's finally ready I got this point I'll believe it when I see it but until then since the fold never is officially launched and huawei's going drew some things this is the first and only folding phone to actually ship in 2019 this is it this is the Royal Flex Pai so I'm taking a closer look at it technically we saw it briefly at CES in January but that was barely hands on like they let us see it and take videos of it but every 5 Seconds they take it out of our hands and show us how to use it correctly so I feel like that but now that I've got it in the studio with no employees remind me I get to treat it like I treat every other phone that comes through here normally so the unboxing is pretty solid kind of janky with the amount of poor transl what's happening in the box but that's not what I'm judging it came with a few accessories in there which is nice but I'm judging the phone here and my first depression just to actually holding the phone for the first time is it's it's really weird looking but I'll get more into that there's a couple different ways to do a folding phone there's the way that folds out with the screen on the inside and then there's the way to fold out with the screen on the outside and the bottom line from what I'm getting with the flex why is the folding screen on the outside is not the way to go so first of all like we knew already the flexible add panel which is the most delicate part is exposed to the elements all the time it's not covered it's also thicker because the when's can't really completely fold flat onto each other and unlike folding a piece of paper the radius of the sold is still way greater than zero how much more of like a sharp curve than a fold honestly and so the whole thing becomes too chunky to reasonably fit most people's pockets it's like kind of like the size of the Seinfeld wallet honestly for your money now you know it maybe I can't judge the concept on this super early Hardware like so many pieces of this feel just like a hack like look at this Hench the most vulnerable important that isn't the screen the hinge it's literally covered in this like accordion shaped Rubber and then screwed in on the it isn't smooth to fold and unfold it kind of makes some noises sometimes when you touch it the wrong way while folding and I just have my doubts about this material not wearing down over time with lots of folds and being in the sun and getting scratched and maybe even ripping I mean technically the rubber on the back here is preventing debris from getting into the hinge and then maybe popping up under the screen so is there a solution around that but now your phone looks like an accordion and also I don't think there's any number of folds that this Mech when is rated for like the Galaxy fold which had that highly engineered hinge we all saw the video where they claimed 200 folds buy a robot and you know we saw that went but this is not giving me the impression that it's more durable than it really feels like a hack and then there's the crease so there were plenty of thoughts on the Galaxy folds very slight increase from again the Royal Flex Pai because of the way it folds out has two creases you can kind of see him like either side of this hinge they try to play like you have three screens one front one back and one side like they really told and it's got this kind of awkward sliding shortcut UI in the middle on this third screen that's not what I would call a third screen but you know with any folding phone they're trying to make features that take advantage of this new form where they ended up with and with this water OS on the Royal Flex Pai you know there's a couple there's not many for example you can turn on or off the back screen at any time if you want with a button that's permanently in the navigation bar the front and back screen are treated like two different user interfaces by remembering the state of your use separately so if I'm on one screen and I open thanks app and I flip it over and on that screen I open up the clock when I flip back to the other side the settings is it still open and when I go back to the other side the clock is still open as well so I can see that separate use being somewhat cool if I get used to it kind of like how the Galaxy phone treated the front and back screen as separate most of the time different wallpaper different app layout the whole thing and then because of the dual camera layout you can have the front and back of the phone show as a viewfinder while you're taking a photo so the selfie shot with the main camera can be you know a higher quality and then people you're taking a photo of will see themselves in the back screen and if you scroll far enough in the camera settings there's something called Baby mode entertaining cartoons and characters to get your baby to I guess look at the phone when you take pictures of them that's cool I guess but with this layout has really taught me is if you want to take photos of something out there with the full View reminder you can't there's no cameras on the back they're all facing you so you can't take photos of things that aren't you unless you close the phone I think my favorite Quirk though is that almost every version of auto rotate almost every version works ready so this works this doesn't work can you get this to work this works this same thing on the other side I don't know why it was so fascinating to me that you have like 16 ways to rotate it and like 14 of them look this is a super early folding phone and this is what you're going to get when you rush to be first mission technically accomplished first but at what cost has it gotten better since CES actually yes specially in the animations Department I still wouldn't call it fluid by any means that's not a word I would use but it's at least smoother than it was a few months ago but no matter how you move around this form factor grabbing the screen from both sides and folding it in half at least on this phone is incredibly awkward ALS things like the volume buttons being split above and below the fingerprint reader which is also not the power button that doesn't help the lack of headphone jack doesn't help the noises you get sometimes when you fold it that doesn't help and of course water OS not having much English in it no Google Play services no Play Store that didn't help either I'm not trying to put my SIM card in this phone and use it everyday and have my information sent to who knows where I guess importing this phone was a bit of a hack in the first place and all that not to mention the battery concerns when I first got booted up this phone I got a little bit of a walkthrough and part of that walkthrough add only to charge it while it's unfolded I literally have no idea why bottom line this phone actually just really makes me miss the Galaxy fold like I already missed it when I had to give it back but this really double those feelings now don't get me wrong FlexPay has flashes of Brilliance like sometimes I just look at it in my hands and it's wild that you have a screen folded over backwards and still working perfectly and responsive and not broken like that's already amazing I feel like you could show this to someone from 5 years ago and I'd be very impressed and surprised but it also makes you think what will these look like in five more years from today okay I've learned two main things from playing with this phone one being first doesn't really matter if it and with this folding phone but then two folding in is better than folding out like folding out is cool and it looks potentially better that Huawei mate X that we've been drooling over because it seems to look so much better than the Galaxy fold I think it will look better but I don't think that's the way to use a folding I think as long as the screens and the hinges are as shaky and not so durable as they are now folding in is going to be the better way also don't forget about add Motorola Razr that's going to sort of fold in if that ever happens I think that's another good way to do it but the whole folding out thing probably not the way to go either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys next one piece
