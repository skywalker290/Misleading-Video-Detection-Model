so here's an exciting one for me I mean I haven't looked at a smartphone from Sony in a very long time I couldn't even remember when will give me and it's kind of unfortunate because they've been in a game for a long time not just a smartphone game but the technology game the gaming games PlayStation TV everybody wanted Once Upon a Time was the Trinitron I had the mini disc player the Walkman changed the game me and others it's like I love to see Sony still doing it and especially when you've got a product like this one which has been requested a lot by guys I'm excited for it because it's a different take unlike the other manufacturers that are just going you know all in on this idea green to body ratio they're like let's go with a different aspect ratio let's try to put as many pixels as possible into a 6 and 1/2 inch screen that anyone so that's why I'm excited for this and I'm also excited because they're doing a promo these are my my headphones in the world right now the wh-1000xm 3 they're doing a deal where you get these for free when you order this this is going to retail for $950 USD so it puts it in that premium price you want to lower the sting of that MSRP those are $350 noise canceling headphones in my opinion they're worth it I'm using for a while your price point on the smartphone having a significant subtraction from a value perspective instead of having to spend $9.50 and another 350 you can look at the effective price of the phone going all volume down to 600.00% on the pre-order currently play some specs on the back 12 + 12 + 12 megapixel camera setup you got to have it this day and age 2019 specially if you want 900 bucks for a on 8-mile 6.5 in that's got to be the highest pixel density I've ever looked at in is my phone I would say 3330 milliamp hours course we've seen devices 4000 plus so I'm not too excited about that after I need 5 IP 65/68 okay this could be the next smartphone that I switched to this could be my next experiment Toronto Raptors purple one you say that flip it over to the front 21/9 Emma wide so this brings us to the next Hot Topic maybe the hottest topic with this particular smartphone you do not see 21 by 9 smartphones said if you look at a service like Netflix for example they claim a significant portion of their content is in that aspect ratio for are you being it's mostly Cinema content in which you'll be able to watch the way it was originally intended now why would you want to go with aspect ratio well what allows you to do is have a 6.5 inch display but in a form factor that you can hold super easy as you can see it's not a it's just a confident grip it's a really interesting aspect ratio could it be the future quite possibly but for now it's one of the rare devices Dolby Atmos going on in here make a sound that's what I do use me type-c connector on the bottom capable of fast charge that's a must you have the speaker unit also in that location right it is a side-mounted fingerprint SC so nothing in display it's going to be your more typical touch-based scanner you would be used to seeing this on the rear of the device on another smartphones a few of them have tried it on the side Sony's doing the same we'll see how that operates see how that works in a moment volume rocker above that power below their kind of weird that they're not both integrated into one but I'm sure there's a good reason for it and then another switch down here on the bottom what is that the dedicated camera switch that would be a nice location for it I'm not sure we're going to have to wait a moment to find out on that one as well look at that you remove the SIM card / MicroSD expansion tray without a tool what a bonus that is all right before I boot up the device let's take a look at the rest of the contents of the package we have a little bit of paperwork a headset with interchangeable ear tips a microphone here is your power brick what is this baby capable of 18 watts of quick power that should be sufficient for most individuals okay little vibration it's so slim it's so comfy it's the ergonomics a small size phone with the screen of a big size phone this feels like a pixel 3 that just keeps going the screen looks incredible it's way more pixels than you could ever possibly discern well can we get the pixel density on this 643 PPI according to will do all right here we go we're going to play fingerprint it's on the side it's kind of a weird it's a different location so how's it going to do how's it going to fare so fingerprint unlock on the side definitely not the fastest it feels a bit faster when you first press the power switch if you don't press the power switch it takes second I don't mind having it on the side I just wish it was a bit snappier maybe I can turn off the animation go into the settings I mean it's so it's very it is an advanced play nine video capture which is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen on a smartphone I mean it's got a real Pro vibe to It audio you have HDR options Kodak your shooting in h265 battery level to focal length ISO shutter speed balance daylight selection manual focus I mean it's not unwanted it's cool it's exclusive it's in line with their DNA I can live with you can launch the camera quickly swiftly lift your device in landscape mode aim the camera and it'll be launched automatically okay that's cool side sense you can take a photo or video by simply double tapping the sensor on the side of the screen I guess they mean the fingerprint sensor okay ergonomics you hold it as a human play the camera and has the half shutter press for Focus half down get the green boom pop the shutter so simple a lot of phones use the volume down but I don't want a double function button do you know everybody like this boom so here we go why Zoom standard Zoom wide I mean it's pretty much what you want let's watch a little video 16/9 content you're going to get black it's YouTube so you can zoom in actually not so bad the crop works completely fine and let's get a sense for the audio performance Dynamic vibration it's like a boost of Dynamic attempts to identify the type of content and then make the adjust I'll leave it on Dynamic I think that's how most people will use it well that is so weird slightly the enhancement is slightly off you can you can pick it up now as far as the speakers concerned get your typical implementation most of the sound comes out of the bottom unit the main speaker Grill in a little bit of high end out of the earpiece play volume is kind of comparable between you this is the one plus seven Pro by the way but I feel like there's a little bit more low-end presence on the OnePlus when what's a dialogue let's do a quick music test do you want to see that comparison real quick look at this so that's the OnePlus and look at how much skinnier I mean maybe it doesn't seem substantial to you looking at that but this like this is the extra this play tough part to reach with your hand when you're trying to reach the far end of the screen I said one plus has the most Bass the iPhone has the most Clarity this one is the most hi I will put these two closer together this one is a little this ones below that I don't find it to be particularly offensive the thing is it does change quite a bit when you go in there and tweak the Dolby settings I mean this is what Dolby off now but out of the box I'd say it's not quite as pleasing what's the weather tomorrow let's see if we can find a 4K 21/9 video I don't know if it's going to come through on camera I feel like I have to bring it listen to you jack for you to really get the right amount of detail this is going to be one of the best video watching experiences on a phone a lot of people that are on the go you end up consuming a lot of content on your smartphone natively it's just hard to imagine a better experience than this where is Xperia 1 from Sony finally a Sony device in the studio and let alone like the most request captured the attention of you guys is some things that for me or promising right out of the box I mean the display is obviously beautiful all that all those pixels unusual aspect ratio I like the dedicated switch for the cameras which I'm going to try out more I'm play skeptical of the battery life though I will look into that also I like the purple color somehow I didn't expect that I'm going to pop my sim I mean here very shortly get to the bottom of it but good on Sony for sticking around and at least capturing your guy's attention up until now we'll pants out
