I worked with them closely that's amazing so first and foremost how are you dealing with the covid of it all how are you where are you terrifying because after being home for so many months and meeting so few people suddenly being in the surrounded by so many people can be a little scary but yeah we and congratulations on being India environment list of the year I couldn't think of anyone more fitting for this title honestly I feel like you have made sustained you look so effortless and you were doing you know you were equal Warrior activist all of these things me before these were Busboys and you know and even though it was contrarian or not part of popular opinion you have been you know you had an unusual upbringing in the kind of school you and your parents and the way they brought you up would you like to tell everyone about a little about this and whether this was the in organizations that I've worked with over the years because each one of them has taught me how to be a more conscientious more responsible citizen of the planet and can you started from my childhood I went to an exceptional school called vidyaranya High School which literally means phones it was based on the philosophy of J krishnamurti so there was a lot of set speed to engaging with nature interacting with nature we did a lot of classes outside in the outdoors and the trees the alarm bells for climate change has started to ring the year I was born this was a very big topic rights you and patterns production and consumption were addressed a lot we even discussed how advertising was leading to a imbalance and I'm learning simple things like composting growing trees and understanding the value that nature brings to our lives to absolutely outdoorsy persons love nature my mother I kind of I watched my mother talked to her plans and know the name of every flowering plant and tree that is one birthday she even gifted me the moon so what do you mean what was my it was one of my buddies and my mother I think that came really from my parents and my father in fact was so conscious about the way human beings were living and working and how that was disrupting the balance of nature very often at the cost of losing work he would refuse to design Industries or do any causing some kind of environment so these were my this is my background this is where I came from and much later what caused by environmental Dam and pollution yeah and then I realized that too little was being done and said in attention to it and write about that time I started to doggedly pursue some extraordinary individuals who turn on to do good work with one of them being bitter from the second picture foundation with the CEO of electricity of India in the end you will protect only that what you love and you will love only that what you learn about yeah exactly so I feel like the fact that you align yourself yourself yourself yourself with a lot of these leaders and sustainability I'm coming to that some of your credentials and it's so please bear with me as I read them out but you're the United Nations environment Goodwill the UN Secretary General advocate for sustainable development of goals and you ambassador to save the children and also board member the sanctuary nature Foundation have I thought all of it yes you have so I imagine that this means a lot of work you know I just want to know what's the day in the life of the Amazon what's the and what are you most proud of achieving the spy in the work you've been doing go to school and passionate about what you're doing time makes itself available to you and I I also get deeply from the assistance and the support I get from the teams that work with me they do make every single day possible 14 hour and you received an email that is kind of intense and Science and you know that gives you I don't know why but I just find from this information that I feel like it's a it's just something that I have to do having said that when you work in a sphere like climate action and your you know constantly so many people who should be acting on climate and doing more continue to dis and the light and what I have learned is to kind of find a way to not attach myself but just step away sometimes if I'm beginning to feel too old and I was going on and perspective and come back but being a part of the solution is really helps because at least then you don't feel completely helpless a person you feel like at least you're trying at least you're trying to do something so it's not it's not all doom and gloom absolutely and it shouldn't be and I was looking for cancer that now that are so many young people in India and all over the world who are speaking up and what campaigning so effectively add so powerfully that it makes our lives easier you know it will help the work that we're doing policy makers to governments is more heightened now than perhaps ever before and I gain a lot of strength from knowing that our community of people is just growing everyday during the lockdown India has unprecedented participation on climate action so there's a lot to feel grateful call and feel a sense of hope literally become a mouthpiece for change because I know that I have personally come across campaigns that are happening so can you tell me some Milestone moments that you think have been achieved in this book if you name some things that have happened oh absolutely you've worked on over the years would have been unsuccessful or not have become a part of mainstream discourse if we had not had so we've actually been able to reach many more people I think one of the most successful camp where you know the effective understanding that a truck full of plastic is that 90% of single-use plastic bottles are not recycled letting more and understand that the average life of plastic is anything between 500 to 800 years and even when it a destruction that plastic and single-use Plastics causes in our sea life are you know Mar but also in human health there is scientific evidence that shows that there has been plastic found there was a lot of statistics and a lot of I have seen a successful change in hashtag I know so many more people within my industry now that this is this is this is something that was I would consider and then continue to dominate our consumption this is something that you know people in India talk about only toward but the fact is that 14 21 most polluted cities in the world are in India India's children are breathing the most polluted air on the now that there's a new commission that has been put together by the central government to understand how this problem can be Madness more people see the connection between waste management and air pollution which is something that was not talked about enough I think would be fair to mention that we managed to make the elephant which natural National Heritage Animal are Center of focus from most Indians didn't even know that the what was our National Heritage Animal and the importance of giving them right of passage I think that is also turn off our Landmark campaigns that has been successful yeah that's amazing I'm coming to your personal Journey activist as well you were both actor and activist and I don't imagine that was as easy were there any challenges when you were starting this when you when you added because unfortunately most mindsets in our industry specially don't quite enjoy a sinking questioning individuals we are considered as problem makers or perceive but the good news is that more women are speaking up and are are not affected by great inspiration from people like Shabana azmi who I really look up to and respect and I think it is a individuals like her who had a flourishing acting careers been of some Landmark Cinema but simultaneously have proven how they can be participated citizens there is a dichotomy that you have to meet with every day and overcome every day what do you mean how do we achieve a balance and when we say sustainable living what is it that can be truly sustainable within the realm of a reach because if you truly want to be sustainable then we just have to So within that I think there are many things that I have learned to understand and find a balance with so a while continue to drive my car which is unfortunately diesel I would happily have made the switch to an electronic it's just not functionally possible having said that carbon footprint you find ways to grow more trees make more sustain more and more people who come I had already started taking I feel like if I don't finding the balances every day it's about making better choices and the most sensible choices that you can with that awareness knowing that it has to go back when did a wonderful organization is doing the work for us a commercial who I'm going to ask you a hypothetical question so if you were to take the proverbial names of policy making what are some what are some policies what is a problem that you want to fix immediately that you think is kind of taking us right now in 2020 I think the biggest problem that we have had when it comes to fall asleep is that if there was a Depot engagement between say infrastructure and is with a forest and climate they would be a lot better choices independently and even within the Emily FCC the the different agencies so there's wildlife in this Wildlife crime this the different agencies even they don't work with each other would be to find a way to get all of these government agencies to working with each other and start engaging with each other regularly you know adorable and achievable how is managing creating systems to manage our waste better informal sector that manages a lot of but there is there are too many areas of our country even that is something that is not managed to achieve so yeah if we could manage to the system of proper infrastructure across the country to waste management better we would definitely be able to com water pollution air pollution and soil pollution that is caused by waste and neglected mismanaged waste I'm not going to move into a rapid fire section of our okay if you had to invite three powerful women to dinner who would they be and what do you think the well the the three women right so I would invite Kamala Harris I would invite one more lady let's see all such unique and Powerful individuals we will talk about women have been treated so unequally and what is it that we can do to give women the equal stages and opportunity that we so deserve because I can't believe it's and we're still dealing with horrific crimes against women yeah but you know what 20 can you admired one of the teachers would be namitha shrivastava she follows me on Instagram that I really loved and admired and then of course I mean my aunt who is also an academician she was a principal of a college very very empowered incredible lady and then of course you read about amazing women in history and in politics and literature people contributed significantly to uplifting humanity and making a difference but yeah I think for me the biggest influence on my biggest inspiration came from the women that I was surrounded by and the women who were a part of my life what's the best piece of advice you've gotten from a woman my mother few things that I mean a simple gems one of course the best way to empower yourself is to educate yourself and the second best way to empower yourself is to be financially independent and the third best is to never allow anyone's perception of you to Define you YouTube we are connected is Charity trouble we talk to each other we've discovered the power of collaboration of partnership gone are the days of those horrible stereotypes that claim that woman cannot be friends I think we can be I'm looking forward to friendships that can help absolutely yeah my last thing to you would be to make sustain be appealing to you know gen Z my millennial generation and everything what do you think what can make it something that's such an attractive proposition you know we spoke about introducing that environment you know how many so what do you think will make us all more excited about it start with our love for a planet and understand that this is the only place I mean you've heard there's so many times but it's it should mean everything to us to do what is within our power and reach to change the that Generation Z or X I feel so proud when my nephew goes into a restaurant and before and I think do you have the power of choice and to be able to say no I love that but also there is an alternative for everything that we do use you know I think that's one thing that I see do you like it's just a matter of finding it and searching for it and subscribing to it you know absolutely if you truly when the intent exists opportunities open themselves up and the purpose easily accessible space to find sustainable life hacks and congratulations again for being our environment list of the Year thank you joining at 6:00 p.m. for our Awards yes I will and thank you thank you so much and congratulations acknowledgment and Empower women through this wonderful celebration thank you bye-bye
