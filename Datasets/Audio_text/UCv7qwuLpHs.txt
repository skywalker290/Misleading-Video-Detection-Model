hey what's up guys MKBHD here coming at you from a hotel room in California with a play Scrappy video but I promise that I would share this with you guys when I got hands on when I got to see it and I finally got to see it Motorola finally had their Loki event tonight and I just show anyone who thinks that smartphones are getting boring just end this video so I'm going to go ahead and apologize right off the top for the absolute worst lighting conditions I have ever seen in a Hands-On area Motorola why did you do it like this please never do it like this again but nevertheless I got some angles for you of the new razor and my initial Impressions and I am just fascinated by this thing so I've never owned actually the original razor but all my friends and this new folding phone version is pretty much the same size as that flip phone from back in the day one of the best selling phones of all time it's still super thin like the original it's got the chin like the original but it's basically a is 20/20 version now I've been talking over the past few months about all these different various ways to do a folding phone this is going to be the favorite for a lot of people and it's of course a vertical folding screen so this is a 6.2 inch 2142 by 76 OLED display on the inside they call it a Flex View display and on the outside similar to the Galaxy fold you have a display a 2.7 inch 800 by 600 G OLED panel that's going to be called a quick view display so of course when you fold it down the phone is literally half the size just the way the original was it really is something special so I actually had like you might have some questions about it I only got to spend about an hour with it in the terribly lit hands on area so I'm going to have to get my pause back on it again to do a full review and really get into the phone but the first major question is how well is it built is it really Built Well like we've seen folding phones break so what is Motorola doing to prevent that well drive time there is good news and bad news the good news is this hinge design feels really good really solid to me it has a weight is springiness to it and it felt premium and satisfying to open and close I mean everyone knows the feeling of closing this phone phone call is going to be super important and of course I couldn't quite capture it in this opposite of a well resume but it's got a nice it slaps is what I'm trying to say it's lapsed it's pretty nice the actual hinge mechanism is again different from the other rolling phones that we are seeing and it seems to work really well to the point where if you lay it flat there doesn't seem to be much of a crease in the screen at as far as I can tell so that was impressive but the bit of bad news is I still think it's going to be a bit delicate there's still gaps on the sides and it still does look like a pretty complex hinge so it's sort of interrupts the otherwise pretty clean angular throw you can see the bottom of the phone sort of start to tuck into the chin just a little bit like you see that down you might not notice it at first Sam Shepard had to point it out to me but it's worth showing definitely going to have to get this phone in the hand though for longer than an hour to see but speaking of the chin what's in there cuz that's that's a pretty big chin on this new razor and that's because any of the important components live down here too so at the top of it you can see that's where your fingerprint reader is so if you still want to do fingerprint unlock you can do that and then at the bottom is of course also your USB type-c port no headphone jack but there's your speaker Grill so it's all downward-facing you do have a bit of a notch for your earpiece and other front facing sensors but no camera up here and that's pretty much it as far as design the rest of it is basically a spitting image of nostalgic razor everything about the shape just the way it sits in your hand really the way it opens and closes yeah it's it's really cool there's also some Android tricks here to make it work and Motorola has built-in things where they usually do with their Moto actions so if you remember the double twist to open camera that's still here things like that oh and speaking of the camera that's the only camera just this that's your main camera and your selfie camera because when you open the phone it becomes the rear facing camera and then when you fold it now it's your main selfie camera so you'll have high quality selfies with that main sensor that's another advantage of this folding design an aspect ratio just to note it is 21/9 when it's open it seems pretty tall and skinny but it's really not too crazy for a phone I mean ask Sony a video full screen and doesn't cut off too much if you're into that apps will work regularly without having to be adapted instead of looking funky and some Square aspect ratio is looking good here and one of the main things I really want to test more is the annuity between open and closed I need to figure out how well that works and also just what sorts of things you can do on that notifications and then you can answer texts and call Google assistant and do some pretty stuff like that which makes sense on the quick view display but that looks to be about it and then the specs for anyone interested are upper mid-range say so not totally all out Flagship but she got a Snapdragon 710 here 6gb of RAM and 128 G storage built-in it's also supposed to be splash-proof according to Motorola but there is no official IP rating so I wouldn't go around play the submerging it or anything like that and the camera spec is 16 MP 1.7 with no Optical image possession and then the official battery size is 2,510 milliamp hours so definitely on the small side for a phone let's be honest a pretty big 6.2 inch display but that's part of the price you pay to get a phone as crazy thin as razor is and then this whole thing this whole package is going to retail for 1499 yes 100 bucks and it'll be available in January 2020 so here's the thing I want one of these put it not in like smart like this is going to be a good phone objectively type of way it's definitely much more of a throwback nostalgic way and people who are younger than me won't even really understand that Nostalgia and also a 6.2 inch display I kind of already have that and it already fits in my pocket so part of me was sort of hoping for an even your display to make the whole folding thing more worth it but the fact that I can fit a 6.2 inch display in my pocket wafer size thing the size of the razor is still pretty sweet I don't know for me this is not the type of thing where I'm going to nitpick a lot you've not play with the way I talk about other first generation folding phones like yeah sure I wish this one had a high refresh rate display I wish it had play Dragon 855 I wish I had a headphone jack I wish it had faster fast charging than the 15 watts that it's supported I wish I had a bigger battery all these things that I wish it had that would have made it even better but I'm not going to nitpick because it's just that next level Dr change that will emit pick the next versions of this phone how about that like it's clearly not going to be the Best Buy for most people but if you could give me one piece of tech from 2019 to bring back to show someone in 2003 I think it would have to be this guy but anyway that's pretty much it for my first thoughts and Impressions and Hands-On with the thing sorry again for the extremely Scrappy quality the Hannah held Mike all this stuff in a hotel room but now that you've seen it what do you think of the whole Razer folding phone concept is this actually the best version of a folding phone or would you have liked to see a bigger screen like me let me know comment section below I'm sure it'll be chatting away either way thank you for watching catch you guys on the next one piece so to talk to the Android expert himself hi don't you love these video conditions anyway that the word for Marques Brownlee noted YouTube celebrity and huge fan of the Motorola Razr specifically this event
