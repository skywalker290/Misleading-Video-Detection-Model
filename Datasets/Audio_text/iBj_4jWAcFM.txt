the first just look at this package my goodness that is the official retail packaging for the new razor 2019 boxing experience edges strangeness I love it all that's what I look for you know I've seen a few boxes in my day couple of boxes okay this is a very unusual smart look at how slim that thing is reminiscent of the original razor which I owned actually the classic it's the addictive aspect well how far is the sound you put your sunglasses this headset has a braided cable it actually branding on the earbuds type c connector courses a microphone in there for conferencing as well type c cable for charging it's got the same braided style going on and then lastly the power brick 18 Wat Motorola is saying flip the prongs up save a little space it's also got a type c to back if you want to use some mini jack headphones that you have any carries forward the same braided design on a cable so which one is tell the difference let me check the brightness real quick there we go oh that is a fun that's fun I'm having fun Jack is that interact with it if you're ready to sit down and immerse yourself in your phone you just you do the Pop open and you get the full experience but if you're in an environment where you don't want to be distracted you just interact on the outside display limited functionality experiment with a little bit more as time goes on how much you can use the outside instead of the inside or if you're constantly compelled to go all the way to the large display experiment with overtime big camera that's your main camera unit on the outside of the device now you can use that as well as your selfie camera because you have the display here as far as taking selfies are concerned this is going to be more comfortable to reach out and snap like this so this let's you use your better camera on the outside of your phone as a selfie camera used it essentially for everything when it comes to unlocking the phone you have a fingerprint scanner in the chin portion down you have two separate batteries one in the top in the bottom and you create this balanced feel in terms of specifications this thing has gigs of RAM 128 GB of storage it has a Snapdragon 710 processor I've been told that there's a lot of consideration that internet decision in regards to protecting this particular design thinking about battery consumption heat and various other Westpac the overall capacity when you combine the two is 2510 so it's something to consider if you're looking at this device obviously you can find devices with bigger battery capacity but that's not really the focus of this thing what about watching video on here is an unusual aspect ratio and so I'm going to load up some YouTube real quick and we're going to get a sense for the the speaker capability ok so it is maxed out already but and interesting all right now I should say it might be time for us to change the aspect ratio of our own videos we shoot because as these things get more and more slender and there's a serious push look at this when I zoom into our content here wow you're moving 16 by 9 content and you zoom in to fill the display where do you put all your stuff batteries speakers I know they are very proud about this hinge by the way and they hinge is really a magical aspect because unlike some of the other lines that I've seen it's almost like this display is floating a little bit watch that bottom part of the chin is suspended in moves a little bit into that what that gives you is far less of an appearance some of the other devices the Galaxy fold for example kind of make a foldable tablet whereas this one feels like a phone still in its unfolded format now let's go ahead and launch this by default you launch into the rear camera grab some Focus real quick bang so as you can see the external display can be utilised to Showcase well this guy whatever you want whatever his name is boom and play famous plant there represented 16 megapixel main camera that's what this year is shot on and the five Meg internal camera look at that and so it is mostly a rectangle still this there's no I can also look at the photos and of course what part is assisted open yeah give me the details I don't care about St Louis I'm calling a Giants or see you later don't get on the wrong side of that guy 201 here is a typical Excel look at that that's the whole it's e Sam so you don't insert your SIM card it's Verizon exclusive in the States it's also going to come to Canada shortly after may or may not be an exclusive when it gets here it's going to be 4/7 support if you do damage to display a need a replacement it's not going to cost it's not going to be the cost of the entire device instead it's going to be 299 I know it's a strange aspect ratio but on the inside this is 6.2 in and the outside display is 2.7 in the Razor for 2019 2020
