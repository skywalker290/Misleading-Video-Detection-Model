possibly the most requested video of all of 2018 so far shout out to Linus from Linus Tech tips because this is his phone actually so thanks for passing it along man this is the Oppo Find X so this is actually the hottest on the planet right now purely thanks to its really unique design has a history of doing kind of insane things with Flagship phones but don't do them very often they specialize in the mid-range but you might remember way back in the day a couple years ago I made a video about the Oppo Find 5 the first ever 1080p smartphone that was a huge deal and also the fine 7:00 so they do have a little history with actually doing impressive stuff so now here in 2018 and this world with lots of notches and compromise in walks the Oppo Find X the specs even though they're excellent are actually probably the most boring part of this phone so Snapdragon 845 adreno 6:30 8 gigs of RAM 256 exist storage of 3730 milliamp hour battery Bluetooth 5.0 dual SIM cards it's a flagship No Doubt we're here for is the design because that's the reason this phone is so hot right now is the industrial design on the surface it looks very modern obviously not a whole lot of bezel anywhere that's the main focus in 2018 full screen rounded Corners all the way across the the phone but if you look around even more there's actually elegant touches everywhere the shape is just a little unorthodox kind of taper play sides but gives way to this intense color design there's a blue and a purple version actually this is the purple which is called read for some reason and it has the Shimmer just on the outside of the phone while the middle stays dark mirror finish it seems like 28 thing to do also to have a glass back but no wireless charging that's also the case for this phone but some awesome design looks super cool but even around that screen they've done some things that are really impressive and unique there's a little 9 mm but I'm are you fine with this and for me it's more about the solid weight like this phone really feels dense in the hand with all that glass there's no headphone jack at the bottom or at all sadly but it has this unique sort of concave shape with the USB C Port speaker and a dual SIM the top of the phone also has the shape of like a liquid glass melting do itself and there is no rear facing or front facing camera at all until you yeah until you open the top the entire top of this phone is motorized for both the rear facing and front facing camera 93.8% screen to body ratio in 2018 you got to make some sacrifices so with this phone there is no fingerprint reader anywhere they didn't do the under glass one there's no fingerprint anywhere on this phone and then of course to do the front open camera they did I think one of the coolest things I've ever seen in a smartphone which is raised the whole thing via a motor and it's different from the next the next feels like a hack to just get a front-facing camera in the phone somehow this feels like can integrated part of a thoughtful design but now that you got to think about again motorized moving pieces in smartphones like this are still a tough ask they eventually will fail and they also make it harder for things like ceiling and make it easier to break and is the whole top of the phone popping up so I'm pretty sure you can forget about waterproofing right off the bat and then when you have this much surface moving you think about maybe if one grain of sand gets in there that could be a problem too it's easier than you think obviously Apple trust this a lot though because as you can see they have the rear camera which you use all the time and the front camera and a suite of other sensors including a DOT projector and infrared sensor up here because this also does facial recognition that's right so with no fingerprint reader anywhere on this phone like the iPhone they built I call a face ID clone in those front-facing sensors in the motorized piece here's the thing though it's actually pretty if you check that speed it's possibly even faster than face ID you register your face in like 3 seconds flat and just look at the phone to unlock it's actually pretty cool it just pops up looks at your face real quick and then goes back down all and about half a second I'm impressed not going to lie I don't know if it's as secure as face ID I honestly kind of doubt it but if it's not getting full easily or tricked by close then it's impressive to me out the box this thing is crazy man and you also have to consider when you have the back facing camera which you use all the time and the front facing camera and the face unlock in that motorized piece that means you're going to you're going to use this every time you open your phone and hundreds more times during the day so that's something to think about I don't know how long this motor is rated to last but I'd be interested to see how long it does also I tried a couple other things just out of curiosity with this motor if you push down hard enough camera just closes the motors just decided should be closing and it retracts completely probably pretty smart actually and then if you put enough resist is on the top while opening the camera and its trying to launch by itself it'll pause wait a second and then it'll try again and then just keep holding it and it'll just keep trying over and over it's not really going to grind its gears trying to go against resistance so it has a couple how do you spell 10 but I also found that I can literally pull the top of the phone open so you can imagine it's not the most durable mechanism in the world if a grain of sand gets in there like I said that's probably bad news for more the internal parts and that just kind of happens sometimes it's more than I wish it did so at the end of the day I love this actually I love what we're getting in this genuinely interesting creative Define in a smartphone just when we thought it might have been getting kind of boring with everyone doing a notch and dual cameras and the whole predictable dance this thing comes in from Hatfield a new player has arrived but I'm curious what you think if this song came to your region it's going to be very expensive but could you rock this as Nova Launcher on here give the camera a shot and it might actually stay in my pocket but let me know what you're thinking in the comments below either way thanks for watching talk to the next one piece
