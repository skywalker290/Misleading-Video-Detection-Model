color is skin color who knows no one knows I want to share with you guys something very special which is the very first comic book I ever made I did the text and I did the illustration the worm I think it was based on the worms the game which was popular at that time and I'll try and translate the best I can for you who lived under a yard or a barn one day he saw refrigerator was so he decided to himself to go out and Hunt he went to the hen and took an egg it doesn't look like he took an egg it looks like he freaking shot an egg with a bazooka just like worms what the breakfast he said then during dinner he was hungry so he you're the forest and haunted then he saw a fox and then he ate Fox for dinner he ate I remember thinking it was so funny to make the ice pop out like I did hear in this picture comical yes I was on to something I knew it I went to the store it's really good later after dinner he was hungry again we ate a moose and he was so full that he exploded then the chicken jumped out of Billy from The bing bang bong ping pong pong pong my God where is it going and then the chicken ate the worm and Fox came out of nowhere then the fox came and ate the chicken and the Moose ate the fox all that was left was a full moose the end what a story wow incredible what is Swedish story I don't know this is what I came up with very nice good job Felix you did it you really hit the nail on my eyes are so blue dude just been slowly dying this must have been when I hit puberty at the age 3029 this is my Power Ranger toy I thought that was the coolest thing in the whole world very proud of that oh see what I said about find cars that's how you draw a car when you're a kid not some cybertruck all right that's a car that's going to be the next cyber truck mark my word another self portrait very nice what in God's Earth have I drawn here that is horrible that is never be creative I don't know why kids let kids be creative it's not good for anyone these are description of me I'm blonde I like tennis I'm happy I'm good at video games and I'm 8 years old and I like school food who likes School food no one likes School food you dummy smoke oh God I like how I decided to color my skin with a background I had to sing for some performance here and I drew here's another self-portrait practically indistinguishable very nice here's me drawing this one isn't bad actually this is where everyone in the forest of Sweden I remember and teachers always said don't eat them but what we found out later was that the Vikings and I don't I'm not into drugs and stuff but I kind of want to go back and eat them just to Define my give me like you can't stop me from eating fruits from oh here's before media hating me party was the region I I lived with them with margin and they put me on the front cover wow Felix make sexy on youtube look at them it's funny how you say this stuff all right what else there's a picture of me and my Felix is celebrity on YouTube this is in 2012 dude this felt so huge to be thanks for what you were doing that's crazy he's spoken about it for his immersive humor and not the least easily add spiritually I don't know how to translate Felix kjellberg's nickname PewDiePie has on a short time become celebrity through his YouTube channel very interesting there's a quote from me saying it has really changed my point rolling in life I was absolutely not the guy who take a bunch of chances before I don't know that doesn't sound me at all I think a lot of media in the beginning try to make me seem like I was a total loser and down on my luck cuz that sounds like a good that story is a lot of the early stuff is like yeah you were pretty much like a loser listen this kid a loser I don't think so I had this guy has spikes all right I'm not a loser that's right I'll be clear I think I should get the spikes back I'm thinking about that look at that look at that point look at that look at that oh God don't yeah well you did it Felix you finally read puberty congratulations wow hey look I got to stand up that's awesome I understand 3rd grade I don't know what to say sick pothead really squeeze you in don't they this was I don't know what grade like high school I think does that make sense damn I look good man just want to be clear I was not cool but the school photo was also the chance you can get to pretend that you are cool by making some sort of weird that was your moment to change everything you want to get a haircut Felix how about that you wanted to try and get a haircut done I do you like this one a lot because I like my belt hang between my legs yeah show that I didn't know what to do I was like I guess I'll just let it go like it would be weird to put it aside wouldn't it I remember I can't do that that's ridiculous oh yeah I found these upstairs that I used to I used to sell these posters they're really cool it was for sailing I think spell first prize division 3 amazing not a good photo play Peter Pan and I remember this because I borrowed can I borrow the outfit from a girl and I for some reason thought that I should be naked underneath the costume by completely naked know call Matt dilemma of like wait do I wear my underwear underneath this or not I don't like that would make no sense cuz there's no there's no will it rain this outfit and I actually remember it was the first time I was on stage and I remember it just kept looking out on the audience and I know I'm supposed to interact with the I just didn't understand why they were laughing at me I just didn't understand what was funny I'm sure I did something cute or something like that but I have a very distinct memory of that and I think it was only 4 years old or something that's better 1997 I ran something I ran it good job Felix I'm in Florida on a jet ski that's cool right I remember they said they were sharks out there so we have to be careful this guy did not give a fuck about that I thought this was funny because I clearly stole this from the library of Gothenburg and I think this is before I I had I'm sorry Gothenburg Library I'll return it one day and of course in Italian 6 alien have seen Felix Play on YouTube the young phenomenon on YouTube see it wasn't always bad it wasn't always bad well I hope this was entertaining for you as it was painful for me I have a really good upbringing I'm very privileged and happy I had it and you know if I had to go back maybe I would change a couple of haircut you know maybe a couple things would be different but overall I'm pleased with the end result so it's okay smash like time for more epic videos and I see you guys next time you shall craft my own poop the hour of Fox channels and what time are you will face butt crawlers and it's almost at home my opinion about that but the prices
