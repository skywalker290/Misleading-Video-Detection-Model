is there has been such an influx of such content both in theatres as well as online platforms that more or less the channel has been doing countless movie and Webb reviews but finally as we have a week or so before any movie content let's get into what the subscriber base loves the most nonsense content in Hindi for all new viewers who have stumbled upon this video This monthly segment of the channel Focuses on regressive and moments from Hindi films and beyond that just blatant absence of logic aspects that were considered to be the norm there was barely any debate about them assumption is that this undoubtedly affected populations which was constantly consuming such content and more or less hooting and cheering in thiet 5 absolutely bizarre Indian movie Scenes that will leave you speechless unintentionally funny films of the 90s in Bollywood was the Golden Kumar directed film bewafa Sanam that released in 199 the movie start krishan Kumar and Shilpa shirodkar in lead roles and is most famous for the scene that I titled as methods you know the things that insecure individuals in relationships do they try and ask the most invasive questions and when share to me bye subscriber pushkar Raj the movie features according to me the most insecure and borderline psycho individuals this is how they proclaim for each other by throwing each other's belongings and testing each other's reactions if that wasn't enough the man tests physical V little did you know that the girl is as abusive and crazy as him imagine being a part of such a relationship how can this be considered to be a funny scene also dharam sankat the problem 90s movies in Bollywood was not the over the top picture which they were presented but the fact that each character be in the hero heroine or headset rules to appease the audience as if it used to witnessing that same format throughout the 80s the Heroine is meant to be tormented the hero has to be the saviour come What May and the villain has to terrorise the entire village with the staple sexual assault scene more or less become a necessary for these villains to have a scene where they take advantage of the women not because it's required for the character but because that's what things do the 1991 movie dharam sankat showcase is a decoy played by amrish puri who looks the village and stumbles upon a woman and eventually the woman tormented so much that she ends up killing herself another villain who isn't getting any action would approach an acquaint quiz and say dialogue such as this all targeted towards what they lost for women who sold job in the movie is to cry and AG kaun kare Qurbani a film that honestly had my rolling with absolute discussed was the 1991 movie Khan carry Qurbani I know this video segment on the channel is a combination of dim the pervasive and regressive content of the 90s and doing my own comedic writing on it but there's honestly nothing funny about the treatment of this film the entire movie is based on cracking the case of a mass serial killer who rapes and kills women the point of his actions is easily conveyed by the woman running in slow motion towards him and they embrace only to make his perverse mind reach the level but this man gets an entire montage as he kidnaps moles and rapes women there are several sequences throughout the film that are just created with the intention to show scantily cl I'm being taken advantage of on the big screen the reason why Delhi crime like an example of a web series that was celebrated this year so effective in its storytelling was because of the sensitive treatment by the creators of the act itself not showing it but effectively conveying charity of the act this is the 90s however was shame doesn't exist to make matters ridiculously absurd the movie show the film and its portrayal of women is absolutely disgusting muqadma I wonder what was so appealing for the creators to show long sequences of assault in Dormant if you see the 1996 film muqadma there is a 5-minute sequence of these Goons appearing in what a woman is alone the entire sequence would first include a week threat being placed as if to ensure the ghastly act that they are going to commit this who are the lead on to a typical villain dialogue ghar mein Kya Kar rahe Hai the sequence tirelessly carries on as a woman raining and thunder is striking every 30 seconds thankfully while running away she finds a cop but the moment you see that Gulshan Grover is playing the role you know he isn't going to rescue her he pretends to reprimand the two Goons and argues and how it's actually not the further leads onto another chase sequence the torment and abuses so much that the individual ends up killing herself a staple of Bollywood movies in that era where the women end up committing suicide sofa I think what can be considered to be the worst film scene that I have spoken about shakti Kapoor you know the intention of that era of Bollywood movies was light how disgusting and while the villains were where the lens to which creators would go to communicate this character traits was way too excessive and unnecessary this scene pushes boundaries of trying to make a mockery of sexual assault this movie was by the way the highest grossing Bollywood movie of 198 shakti Kapoor talks to his friend the only solution available now as he is not got a decision of the property dispute when he sees a woman walking and minding her own business the treatment of the topic will Sky your eyes and ears as how this was accepted as a conversation between a man and a woman turn Bollywood honestly is something that is beyond my understanding and I'm glad we have a wall to some kind of sense and acquiring a basic social resp follow
