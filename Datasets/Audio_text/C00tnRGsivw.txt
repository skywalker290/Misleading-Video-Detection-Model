Karina welcome show me call the Bold Bunch okay thank you and welcome you know I can see how many shows do you do OK Google how is someone who who fits in as as as as the Boardman as making Bowl choices but I think that I think that it's true I think that you are I think despite the fact that you became a star early on in your career you've made unusual choices which a lot of your contemporaries didn't I think are you adapted to the changing landscape of Bollywood in a way that you're just as comfortable in a bajrangi bhaijaan as you are in actresses I know that you know the work life balance when when normal people do it it's not celebrated what's the Remake the official remake of Forrest Gump that you agreed to audition for the road just wanted do you know that if because knowing the way he is yeah you know I think that he wanted to be like 100% sure so very randomly out of the blue I got a I think I'm I've been a self-confessed armor fan right I don't know I think since I've been like 10 years old but I think he truly one of the finest actors one of the finest Minds that we have in this universe have you tested for rules that in my own country she's such an important figure in that film is it about this role was it was it just you know an opportunity to get to work with Amir why did you want to do this film well apart from it being I set an iconic pot and iconic film of course I mean it's like everyone knows that I'm if I'm going to call me for I just like I said I think he's a cinematic one of the greatest cinematic Minds that we have in our business and I've also done like you know yeah exactly so I think you'll be having an amazing chemistry and we have I have this amazing respect increase volume with each film each character so obviously I think that you know working in that kind of atmosphere you get to can you clean gold in that I've never seen something like that before so I want to be in that world just come back from shooting play irrfan Khan the last time we met a few months ago I remember you saying that you were looking forward to that what was that experience like what's like always that you know when they offered me the spot when homie offered it to me I was like actually if you go to that's a very small part of me you know so should I really be doing it right I don't know I thought about it but you know going back and there's nothing known as what time is gone I think it's all about just about right and what is the what is the weather that you have on the audience I feel like despite the fact that you worked in somewhat 50/52 films in in almost you can still clean up bring a freshness a delicate fragile quality to your roles which every time a rule require the weather in and the two specific ones I want to mention are omkara and udta Punjab I think that that delicate fragile quality was visible in both those parts ability to bring a vulnerability and an innocence which you know I think when does have work for me or sometime what's the trick to being able to do that like I said you know and I want to play just you know Kareena Kapoor the stuff but I think that that's never been that of course I had to do that because you know because I am like you know star and that just happened so I would you know Panda to that images as well but actually I have always you're hungry actor I've always wanted to do you know different parts so when Utah was narrated to me when chubby came and said standing add this kind of newness and freshness that I'm okay to try out something else even if I'm not really the central part despite being a mainstream you know once you say yes to a character you know what is your process what is your approach you know I've never heard you through intellectualize your process you know that's only says but but having said that there must be some preparation some approach do you I mean how many times you need to read a script before you get out of the set do give us the night before how do you get into the head of these women you know if whatever the film is just feel that an actor is as good as his lines even actor is fully prepared with his dialogue when you're there you can juice it you can make sure you know if you know it's like cooking a doll it's like you know you know right about it turns out to be I am one actor who's I will know not only my lines but I will what is an old lady music I'm fully prepared play Salman Khan but I think this added a lot of newness so you know all these things also I feel really really matter you know in today's time do you feel like you've changed a lot as an actor do you feel like when you look at some of your early work you there is a big difference two decades give me an actor and I'm very instinctive so I think I'm just understood the craft I don't know about being a better actor but I probably have understood the what's been the hardest character to crack into I'm actually because you know being so switch on switch off and because of loving bombing and acting so much it's never really been tough but if I may say which people will not believe I genuinely because and I think people who get upset if I would say that I'm not like her because they loved her so much that you know people like she's like this song time to get into this zone of her being so free and he being so precise about everything I think that was quite interesting and fun and difficult and being more free I feel what's the character that feels closest to who you are in person what is the character that reflects your personality will it snow tomorrow but honestly I genuinely feel that all characters have a little bit of you know what the person is but I've never I can't pick a character and say that okay this is me right now you know I loved it and Dolly was just yeah and I enjoyed doing it keep playing that part was something that I I actually enjoyed so much that I think it just flowed what's the word and the life has changed since you became a mother do you feel like you see the world differently you see live differently I mean has it affected you're acting in any way you feel there's probably a lot more there's a lot of emotions flowing here and there you know all probably hormones going haywire I how do I look at life is now I don't look at life through my eyes from my son's eyes he was like 78 months I would be like no no no no I'm going to be like really chilled and very relaxed but it's like I can't can you look at life differently I mean you're doing a film called Good News which is which is I think now we can talk about it it's about Saturday and Saturday look at how do I feel everybody's experiences one should hear what kind of absorb but but I think play being a mother my experiences are very personal and it's my own so you know because there's no perfect crown for like following where's my career my life my my marriage everything does he have a sense of what's going on does he kind of you know I mean he watches you I'm guessing put on the music how about what it is that you do you understand that a man above gone for shooting you know so he's when did that they go out to work and that's called shooting and he's been to the set so he kind of he understands that zone he's curious but we haven't shown listen to right now all he wants to do this is what you want to do something what's the question that you've been asked many times about about you know if he decides to become an actress far away of course he's going to be three but have you thought about it's impossible not to think about that right I mean yeah of course you know I mean in Spanish play David weeks I think is there because the show is called the Bold bunch is there a decision is there a key decision that you play that you made me alive a bold decision something that you feel has contributed directly to where you are today what's a big decision that you feel really changed your life and maybe your career what was I was getting married and I had a couple of people call me on the 14th of October and say that are you sure you really want to do that because you know it won't be the same what time is it at the most it's fine I won't have work at the end of the day that's okay of course everyone was like this is it it's not going to be it's not going to happen you know and I was just like okay fine we will deal with I'll cross that bridge when it comes because I have always let my life like that and let the situation happen and then because I don't need to be and I think so that was the first decision and then everyone was like oh you know now baby then you'll definitely get into like you know mummy mode chicks you have a good time of being friends and what their life is right I thought that was quite cool also but you know it's interesting did you that you said most people think come back with a biopic you actually chosen almost consciously do not do a central whatever I'm using the best songs ever found something that I think that would be like amazing to like you know I think that something that I'm super excited about tell me one thing do you know let's flip this I mean what was who's who's if you are willing to be opposite Aamir Khan do you think of an have times changed as the industry changed so much that an A-list male star can you agree to beat the romantic interest to I mean what am I going to be in Lali Singh Jeddah he's the bravest of Brave so I don't know I wouldn't be passed anything past him because he's Davis actor that probably is do you feel like that are interesting opportunities there and are you open to the idea I think so I think that it's not about I don't want anyone to like you know say that I don't like it when they say that because I think that it's it's doing Injustice 14 next year next year 2020 you know when you're growing up and you thought you know of course 40 is the new 30 yeah but you know what the things that you wanted to accomplish before what is the stop still have to do you have a whole year to take those things off no I don't want to plan I don't want to plan I don't want to take Mark anything I don't want to do anything like by the book you know let's let's I want to go I want to see the Northern Lights and hopefully that is one thing travel elevated food life in such you know true I think that if you're crossing the road and something Falls in your head you can die lovely 100 thank you thank you
