hi this is sushant Singh rajput and you're watching Bollywood hungama so keep on watching he's an actor who loves to internalise the find nuances of Acting in humor or happiness sushant Singh rajput is adept it almost everything and right now just passing the glory of his latest film kedarnath that we all act what's the time I'm not saying acting in terms of that we lie all the time but I'm saying that we generally act all the time and as you know what I used to doing films is that we are told not to act not to make it natural make it natural well pink like that then you try to cut down your emotions so that the other character does not play if you don't want to if you don't want them to know then you're cutting down on emotions and what your left with on your face who is next train he actually defines the his perimeter what he cannot do then what gets left when is face is is the small ones is and that's exactly what he was supposed to do basically in the film are you happy with the I'm hoping that is the word of mouth which says that the film is is light by the audience which is a good thing all I can take the meaning is that good feeling how do you respond when you see people sitting in dark holes responding to certain things happening on the screen the way you guys are intended them to I can only assume that that's happening because I I can watch to 203 of my films back to back so there is a certain takeaway you understand that oh this is something that do and should not do because that's a pattern in all the films you are playing three characters so there shouldn't be any molarity in terms of unintentional so then there is a take away so I don't watch my films I don't understand I don't I don't have the experience of it but I can only assume that they would understand that the chai sequences something that that people are liking a lot and you have no key romantic box play what the scripted those points intended to do important event just because they are together over a period of time because he's the reason of his father's death so he's trying to compensate by giving to everybody else except thinking about himself and but when he meets muku he realises that this completely remix contacts public influence cbse there is judiciary we need to have a talk so there are way so I think we are we are mixing the context and we are not acknowledging the nuances as a society when a certain things that same statement in several tweets by a lot of people example now I understand the context can you give your specific answer to this as a society we don't acknowledge nuance and that gets manifested in different major problems that we have it is the same thing we don't see that there is a difference between a correlation and a causation is there South America in the context of an event to what the fiction The Corrs but is this was not the cause the Year difference in correlation or causation Alex we don't understand that there is a difference of the Context it is not the problem we don't need to fight together certain scenes in the movie where we realise that we have this this this this arrogance about a lot of things but the factors when when nature decides to take take action everyone is equal everyone is vulnerable there are talks of a major earthquake possibility in Himalayas it can be catastrophic something is acting 7.5 is just fighting over trivial issues like religion and and that metals are better or Meri Baat Manny chahiye you think it's it's high time people realise that high Times because this is for sure are things cannot stop what is inevitable technology cbi 65% of the kids who are going to kindergarten this year if the ever end up having a job will end up working for technologies that are still not invented yet brick global problem with arrow knowledge structure education how many coding stop it from coming always been like this future future is already here it is just unevenly distributed Amit trivedi is music and Amitabh Bhattacharya lyrics stars in their own right single-handedly define the although I understood my character as a medical destruction of it does it will not discriminate so probably I can base Mansour on the life that does not discriminate so that I understood as okay so my question was that you understand the popular Hindi movie context how important is music composition of course Sara Ali Khan's grandfather so the reviewer felt it was a bit inappropriate so till the time it was not pointed out so her grandfather so I couldn't understand the context what is if I name myself trump will I be treated like one what is your take on reviews so this is my answer if I if I rename myself as Trump can I change the reviews honestly I know exactly what I was feeling so this is the last thing that I want to is there something that we understand in science and science doesn't analysing and watching the experience these two experiences are completely two different experiences now I have seen and why the film is happening the writing is happening I'm not saying it is right wrong very good very bad I'm not saying that all I'm saying happened to be completely different experiences by neurochemistry absolutely right probably the different experience that I'm talking about the second one is the more accurate to experience I don't know all I'm saying we are different can we also be a bit like without analysing over judgemental or anything couplets from so how important is Reading or maybe pursuing certain hobbies for any creative person and how it impacts their art creative art is very important but it's in our hand completely which will make us more creative is this learning and learning new things but just not and you learn that the more you learn the less time it takes to learn more so you how many things we can learn what will happen the lesser it will take for you to learn even to understand so you will start learning many things things that you will try for the first time will be 50% easier for you than anybody else and it is not about and also you're not stopping because you like doing it then you save for rest of your life so it is not about competing at all director we have who's making a comeback after 8 years what is the latest on drive next year this is what I've been told you I was having so much different experience from what you've done it doesn't need that I'm not saying is the best you talk what date are the European trained in other words how important is that for an actor and in in theatre Crack a Joke and I know you love it it is so dynamic so the audience plays an active participant as a feedback loop as an actor to understand that is very important I'm not saying acting cannot happen without the of course that knowledge is very very crucial to understand what to leave on the so that the residents have we understand that I know that if I do this and I stop they will or I know that if I if I just up here 46 months of next year so you're also having one more release is very interesting and iit character stop at 5:12 Instagram diplomacy your search night out yeah
