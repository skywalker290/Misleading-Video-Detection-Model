hey what's up guys MKBHD here and welcome back to your play coverage of the world's most densely packed keynote WWDC 2019 and I'm going to say that Loki my favorite announcement from that entire keynote was iPad OS 13 see if you remember there were a lot of complaints and feelings iPad Pro review and many others about how this is clearly the best iPad ever it's incredible Hardware Great screen great battery great ship but it's still sort of held back by the software by iOS and it still felt like just an iPad well fast a couple weeks till now till that crazy keynote happened and now we have an update alongside iOS 13 specifically for the iPads it's iPad OS know it's not an entirely new operating system it's still iOS 13 for iPad but this iPad OS directly addresses so many of the complaints in those features that it was lacking that sort of bring it up to speed of a much more impress if computer so in a way this software update kind of feels like it saves the iPad Pro for me so let's break this down first of all the widgets on your home screen so I never thought I would say that about iOS but technically you do have these here so at least on the left hand side vertically scrolling list but these are the ones that were over to the side of your home screen on your iPhone but you can pin them right alongside the rest of your smaller icons and they long way towards making it feel a bit more like a real computer already you know and
