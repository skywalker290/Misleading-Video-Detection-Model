hey what's up guys MKBHD here and this is finally the pixel 4 the most leaked phone in history probably is finally revealed and I feel personally attacked so the title of this video is Google and gaps so the pixel 4 we already kind of knew almost everything about it but now that it's actually out it's been on stage in the details of all sort of been filled in it's kind of what we expected it's a very Google phone Android 10 and the Google play some new features and all that but also there's some head scratching gaps some things missing with this similar to other pixels is definitely the tamest part of this new phone it's not a flashy design at all to the it's got this big forehead it's bigger than the chin it doesn't have the thinnest bezels it has a flat display which I actually like and there's three colors black white and orange I like they're still doing the color power button so the Panda one has has an orange power button and an orange one here has this sort of pink power button that's okay I wish it was white and they all matte black metal rail around the whole phone around the top the sides the speakers at the bottom and the USB type-c port matte black all the way ground everything and it's a nice weight of the whole phone and I really like the soft touch matte finish On The Backs seems like 2019 really become the year of matte black finishes except except for the fact that the black phone is the only one that's not Matt finish so this orange one is Matt on the back the white one Matt on the back and the all black phone which could have been matte black everything is glossy for some reason so I don't know I feel slighted but you can see what it's a pretty simple design flat display instead of curved over the edges a solid pair of speakers with the second one being up in the earpiece at top and on the back you of course have your camera Square bump the infamous design trend of 2019 but it isn't what cameras up here it's dual cameras a Flash and Laser autofocus so it's one standard camera and one telephoto a 2X telephoto so they didn't include an ultra wide camera on the pixel 4 and I don't know what kind of waiting this is something we've been waiting for for a long time to see finally multiple cameras in a pixel they've always done the best they could with software with one camera but the one thing you can't fake with software is an ultra wide so now that every other phone in this class has an ultrawide I was pumped to see it I was I'm glad to see what they could do with an ultrawide camera on the pixel and then I didn't do it put it then if they had just put it in anyway so you have a standard camera and the 2x telephoto and this will be better for some things like portrait mode which now play works with the telephoto you can't take wide portrait photos anymore and the rest of everything else with the normal camera should still be fine I mean this is one of those things I got best of course for the full review to see if it's actually better than the legendary pixel 3 or if there are instances where maybe just night mode is better or if do photography or those things they showed on stage with the stars and the moon at night look better but so far from what I've seen it looks to be another smartphone camera you can follow me on Twitter if you want to see the sample photos I post and of course that will make its way into the full review but yeah so far do I get so long wide angle can be fun we think telephoto is more important yeah I definitely feel personally attacked all right so why does the pixel 4 have such a big I guess it's better than the bathtub Notch but what's the big deal here pixel 4 now has an entire Suite I'm facing sensors up at the top including infrared and radar which is new in smartphones to do what they call the fastest facial recognition unlocking in any smartphone and they're so confident in it in fact that they've gotten rid of any other biometric authentication which motion sense parts of it seem pretty cool other parts of it a little rough so when motion sensors on it uses the radar to when you're coming near the phone to pick it up and then it preps the cameras in the sensors to read your face and unlock it immediately as you're picking the in with the new UI for that and gave it a shot and it worked pretty well I picked up the phone from a flat then it was on and unlocked by the time I even got it up to my face and I didn't even have to press the power button so that is pretty cool I don't really think anything about the actual reading of your face is anything crazy proprietary it's still infrared it's still works at a decent amount of angles but it's I'm at radar to sense when you're coming and picking up the phone and turning it on early that's the cool part and then they use radar also to do a couple of other adjust your bass things and these are much more hit or miss I actually like the one where you have a timer or an alarm clock going turn off and when it starts beeping as you reach for the phone the radar sees your hand coming and quiets down the alarm and that's pretty cool and you just wipe it away and it's silence is it now I got the alarm quieting down as I reach for the phone to work every single time flawlessly but the whole swipe away thing that didn't always work for me every time and this was a theme in general with the whole swiping thing it's hard to get it right which you know could be rough in the morning if you're trying not to hit things on your desk as you swipe your nightstand over and over but it's also supposed to look for accepting or denying a call and moving forward or backward in media and this was way harder to get it to work than it should be Play Store swiping over the phone is supported you see this glowing happening at the top of the notification bar and you can see it move to the after right when it works and it recognizes your hand movement but I honestly think I got it to work like 10 of the times that I actually tried to swipe it there is no real feedback about what I was doing wrong or how I could do it better so this seems like something probably never going to use you might remember LG did this too on their last Flagship with infrared but I got to give them credit because they actually had a little who on the screen of at least how to do the weird hand gesture better like get closer or get further up top there's no such Decatur on the pixel so it's frustrating me difficult anyway my favorite feature about the pixel 4 without a doubt easy is a 90 love that my first impression is it looks great it's nice and smooth as you'd expect from a higher refresh rate display and it's a high resolution too it's 3200 by 1800 so my first impressions of this OLED are it's pretty color accurate sharp but not very bright I definitely struggled Outdoors to get bright enough but if that's going to be its weakness we'll learn more about this as I use the phone more for the review and then the rest of the specs Snapdragon 855 not 855 plus I think you're looking at 6 of ram at 1 2 8 2800 or 3700 milliamp hour battery I think that's smaller battery might be something to keep an eye on for the pixel 4 special with that 90hz but the bigger one which I'm testing the Excel 3700 million hours seems fine I will find out as I test the phone but 10 is the same as previous bettas on your phone's does the new face unlock UI like I mentioned along with some camera app improvements and Improvement to Google Assistant speed it up even more and let's use the hands-free more often and there's also now a pretty sweet built-in voice memo app that's actually impressive it now transcribes everything you say in real time on the device and Records it all in text as well so you can see it marking and then you can go back into search and use the text to search for each word you say and it'll show where voice memo you said that word so that's pretty impressive if I was a big voice memos guy I'd be super into that so look a lot of the stuff it's better it's not drastically impressive like nothing really wowed me and maybe that's because everything leaked like we saw everything I was going to be coming so it's impossible forget surprised by the event but yeah it's felt like there are some serious gaps too like okay then no matte black end of the phone okay I get it you want to mix it up have a little glossy fingerprinting back with the matte black okay and then Alexa better and you have extra Ram but no Snapdragon 855 plus it's kind of sort of this weird time of year where phon I'm starting to come out now with the Snapdragon 855 plus and this phone for more money doesn't have it so it's kind of tough and then the lack of the ultra wide really that's tough like I was so looking forward to having like what could they do with an ultra wide pixel camera how good could it be and now we don't have that and it seems like Google might not even really care super much about that either there's no 2x button in the camera app it's just kind of there I thought it would be mandatory if you adopt this whole Square thing like you have to have triple cameras we'll see I don't know for 799 I think the pixel 4 the smaller one that's going to be a tough sell because that's a hundred bucks more than the iPhone 11 and well that's just regular pixel 4 but for the XL that starts at 899 I think that'll be more compelling interesting buy and that's the one I'm testing so that's the one to stay tuned play for review of let me know what else you want to see in the comments section below if you have any concerns battery life maybe the cameras maybe there's video quality things you definitely want to see in the review let me know but no matter what you do make sure you subscribe to be the first to see that when it comes out October rolls on lots of stuff happening it's been your first impression as the pixel 4 thanks for watching catch you guys the next one
