subscribe to Sunset and press the Bell icon. next award award is for the honorary Millennial of the earth he might be a baby boomer but he has a firm pulse on what Millennials want. Legends match by his pop culture fandom and his sartorial choices have gone from baggy black in his teens to look at me now colors in his word. fashion is a costume party and we are all invited to present this award can I call on state somebody who's already on state so you can. that's great. I'm not quite sure what honoree Millennial of the Year means but I think. somehow reads like a midlife crisis award so I'm going to accept this midlife crisis award because I think I am going through. and as you can see the Eiffel Tower on my jacket are falling for what I expect in the rest of the year and as far as I think. link up I have to say is that I've always kind of felt the need to kind of feel the pulse of everyone who is a millennial and I just found out recently. shut off voice apparently 35 to 98 or something like that anyway. 92 born so I'm very far away from being a millennial or anywhere close to it but I'm a wannabe Millennial I've always been and I'm proud to be. I want to be and I just want to say that all I've done is ever been comfortable in my skin and that's what I tell everyone out there please. just be comfortable in your skin there's no other way to be to do all the ages sexes misogyne. can homophobic are there read between the lines thank you
