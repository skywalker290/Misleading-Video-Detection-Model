I'm getting a test of cyber truck all right it's been about 48 hours and I'm back at the studio and I've been able to sort of crystallize a lot of my thoughts that have been floating around about play cyber truck may have watched my initial super quick early video of It from the event a lot of people have then after that event I didn't order and people kept asking me hey wait Marquez did you pre-order the Tesla cybertruck and my answer is usually I don't really need a pickup truck so no is Cybertron really change that but it was really interesting but then of course you have the test ride which for Tesla is notoriously effective and then just a bunch for information and images and videos since that event have come out a lot of these photos and videos show new angles of things like the interior the what's in the bed of the truck and of you from the back seat and the spacious roofline and even how much that weird marble countertop look so strange in the front I'm not sure still how I feel about that but it's definitely still there Twitter user Matt Landry got a video of the morning and closing of the rear hatch so the driver presses a button on the side and it's pretty cool to see it basically slot open and reveal review mirror and sliding clothes will protect the 6 and 1/2 ft bed that's allegedly so strong that you can stand on it and also Elon on where has since confirmed that there will be an option to make that cover a solar panel which could regenerate up to 15 Mi of extra range per day which could be useful it's really cool but the specs of course are still right and a lot of people who did their test drives posted their videos of them and they were demoing the duel 4 1/2 seconds so that's definitely faster than most other pickup trucks and even though that's about the least important spec for a pickup you know care more about things like total load capacity and how much you can tow that is still a fun byproduct of having an electric motor and they will definitely show Quinn of snazzy labs in his video the bed itself has an l rail on the inside of the bed and then the floor of the bed there's a bunch of slots that you can use and these two things together can make whatever com definition of mounting points you want to tie things down or arrange what you're carrying in that huge 6 and 1/2 ft bed that is really smart I think they should have mentioned that it's not why I'm buying it but I do appreciate a good modular design also since the event Elon has tweeted at supersaf confirming that there will be a matte black version of the cybertruck After People sent him renders and I swear that's not why I'm ordering one look at the end of the day when people are talking about cyber truck you inevitably land on the design just everything looks like and some parts of it are dope and some parts of it are weird I actually think the lights in the bed are pretty cool assuming you can turn them off of a huge bar light on the front looks sick and it's actually very functional on the road and the what is more of just cool looking lights but yeah it's the Angles and the line choices that make this one of the most polarizing 20,000 comments actually let me just check it's over $30,000 comments now on the Cyber truck first impressions and reading through the comments they almost alternate hilariously between like this is amazing this thing looks dope it's one I'm glad they what's the outside the box I'm really happy I want one and then the others will be this is stupid I hate it it's the dumbest looking truck ever I mean when you look at this truck there isn't a single anywhere it's all angles and points and lines it's kind of like how I draw a truck when I was like 5 years old and didn't know better but Simplicity of it means it's very different from all the other trucks that are on the road right now much more striking and when you think about it and can you take some time with it the more you realize this was all on purpose to stand out in a sea of hundreds of other pickup truck options this one had to be different it had to be striking and it had to stand out in a way and then they had to really lean into it and really embrace it to give people a reason to think about it differently it's the same way I'm convinced right now that Apple lately does think about making new product design choices that are intentionally a little bit jarring just knowing that the memes but soon enough when people get used to it it'll be the reason it's recognizable and even iconic Tesla here is trying to break into a market pickup trucks that has been established for decades and it's so mature that the top five best selling cars in America for 30 years running are the Ford F-150 and a bunch of other trucks that look like the Ford F-150 he's really great tweet from Twitter us my research director Brett Winton imagine you're trying to break into 100 billion market segments that is 89 m has stronger brand loyalty than any other segment and doesn't give a shit about your eco-friendly bonafides that is there are literally millions of people that buy F-150 then 5 Years Later by another Ford F-150 and then 67 years later buy another F-150 and so if you come out with a new Tesla pickup truck that looks kind of just like the Ford F-150 and instead of an engine it has what's a battery and some Motors and a Tesla logo on it no looks like it they're just going to buy another F-150 so after opening a presentation with a whole monologue about how pickup trucks have all looked the same I'm forever which is totally true they leaned hard into a completely different look and never looked back this is why I'm pretty sure next to model y the cybertruck could end up being the most important vehicle Tesla makes and in this Tech World possibly the most disruptive but yeah between now and when they're actually into production and start to ship the thing 146,000 cybertruck orders so far these are from I still don't think it's pretty it's definitely not it's more brutalist but I don't think other pickup trucks pretty either it just had to be different and I am here for its position as a disruptor and I guess I'm finally starting to erase my position as a tech reviewer where as this is sort of a piece of tech I'm on the bleeding edge of this stuff and I'm investigating it refundable deposit that holds my place in line that can turn into an but I'm in line for a triple motor cyber truck I'm all in so I'm looking forward to testing this thing along with the other stuff that we're expecting in the next 2 years but that's pretty much it also if you want to get in on this merch is a couple days left of it to get ordered where it will ship before the holidays I think 9 days left so link below to that as well I think that's it okay thanks for watching
