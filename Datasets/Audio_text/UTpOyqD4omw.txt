have a confession to make who could not talk while I still cannot talk and I have this fascinating excuse play I would love to share my journey with you my learning singing case you decide to drop out and what can I tell you that you already don't know I'm assuming and most public you guys are way much more smarter and better weather forecast says believe in next Saturday so I don't need to talk about that good afternoon thinking I I I I don't have to do things that I can actually discuss about talk about chasing your dreams and actually living your dreams which fortunately nobody mentioned to me when I was starting out and those two things are I always wanted to do this in front of professors so much sorry for that what's this that I was told about the biggest lie was plus recognition is equal to happiness is equal to success so let me Begin by mentioning that I come from away middle class family and when I was growing money was a big big big big big differentiate in my life also in the three generations off my family that I know of that are documented nobody knew what pain affect like so basically money and recognition were missing when I started out so I already started out as a call my sisters what does examination and then probably yeah that would be like opening the doors for kind of happiness and I'll be forever successful Volume Plus two got myself a drone in a nice cool and with them on there and 5G and half it everyday after finishing my assignment School assignments and preparing for my engineering entrance exam I have to wash my clothes and I had to cook food for myself but I wasn't complaining I was for the very first time in my life I was so close to become successful for the first time in my life finally I slowed I got selected for you should be happy because you're supposed to be happy but it wasn't working that much something was missing there was play that I could feel so I thought maybe something bigger was required for some but I was bored you

life and I was becoming more and more popular now I cannot go to first dream house I bought myself my dream car play friends could only possibly dream of call Daniel time of my life and then something unusual I got used to everything I felt cheated I stayed with all these dreams for 10 and 15 years of my life I stayed with me money Play Future me again was leaving the present mean but this time I decided otherwise I would do something else so I won't take too much time I'll just try to keep it I figured something I figured that something seemingly big things I'm looking back in the past I real but maybe smaller things will be bigger and there was one thing that was missing in my life that was the cause of this illusion and that thing that was missing was now I was all these years just I was obsessed about I am so much interested that there was no room to think about future or the past and for the first time trust me in a long time I understood the true meaning of success which was not money plus recognition but it was now just realization happened in 2011 and it has been yes now let me share another ladies shorts story with you when I was in school go to 5:30 p.m. was the time and
