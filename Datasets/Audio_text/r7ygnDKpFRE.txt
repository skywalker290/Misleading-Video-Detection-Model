we think we know about iPhone 8 all the rumors all rounded up in one place so the things we think we might know the things we may not know some really interesting Panera I will leave that link below but this this is taking it to the next level so this has happened before but this is a model will physical in hand representation of all these leaks and rumors and everything we know about the next iPhone and what we're expecting of it so this is something like what case manuf where is Mike get their hands on to start to design their iPhone 8 cases and start to prototype their iPhone accessories this is all the physical dimensions and everything based on what we know so thanks a Sonny Dickson again for helping us get our hands on this but I figured I'd get a little bit more in depth of it since we actually have which has some really awesome edge-to-edge action but also has some interesting top protrusion going on coming down from the top you may have seen this in the latest leak where the homepod firmware had a little bit of a silhouette develop found that represents the next iPhone and it has this indentation at the top for these front-facing sensors it looks a little bit weird in the glyph sing it in real life this is what it would look like and honestly still looks a little bit funky but now that you see how the display kind of wrap found that bar with the rounded edges everywhere it still looks really interesting reminds me of the renders of the essential phone actually which we have also yet to see but obviously this is what it looks like my biggest question is what Apple plans to do with the software you know will they put stuff up there in the to one side the signal strength to the other side and then notifications in the middle what do they do it'll be really interesting is literally the screen to body ratio this is always been a weakness of the iPhone it's 2017 bezels are shrinking the iPhone has had a massive forehead and chin and even side bezels forever iPhone 7 plus had 5.5 inch display this year but is still one of the biggest phone bodies on the market this iPhone 8 model has what measures 5.7 to 5.8 inch diagonal but in a smaller body so this is a big deal for the modernization of iPhone and for sure smaller body more handheld more pocketable so thanks to some After Effects magic this is what the display on the front of the iPhone might look like when it's on with iOS 11 again not really sure exactly what they do with the status bar stop we play around with this for a bit but you can see it gets a lot closer to that 2017 feeling of just holding a display in your hands will be getting closer to the corners of course but let's be real it's probably worth it and people are kind of breaking their phones anyway so now how to quick things you may notice about this body number one is the glass back so the iPhones up to this point have had these metal backs which are steel and look super premium but of course don't support wireless charging wireless charging doesn't work through metal this iPhone 8 model has a glass very similar to what we've seen in Samsung phones like the Galaxy S8 and note so you can support wireless charging but keep the metal on the other thing is the camera bump on the back is of course still there it's pretty big but of course this is what we sing for months now and leaks about the new iPhone new orientation for the camera sensors flash in the middle in between them and hopefully these new play Speck bump to go with that big camera bump and take some more awesome photos and videos with this new year the power button on the side I noticed it's in the same place but it is a little bit bigger which is interesting because of the rumor that Apple might try to stick a fingerprint reader in the lower button this year since I couldn't get it to work under the display in time but the most recent info suggests that this will be a normal power button and apple will go all with 3D facial recognition for unlocking your phone securely allegedly that can be just as safe if not more so than add fingerprint but you already know I'm going to be testing that and then yeah just the overall premium look and feel of this model it's way nicer than 3D curve right at the edges sort of melts into the side rails so smooth around there it's smooth the hold but that is pretty much it and honestly this is as close as we're going to get to seeing the next iPhone sort of someone actually the phone in person but let me know what you think is this something you would rock in 2017 and 2018 as iPhone 8 maybe share play with your friends who are interested in seeing what iPhone 8 will look like but until then that's been it thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one
