I don't play sports I don't watch Spotify not for me to have a football sequence in the first half and to have a triathlon in the second combination of of swimming cycling and running see I'm actually explaining what I try to learn this because it was a first for me to even understand what that was 27 physical fitness the boys had to go through which was torturous to them they had to play football in this week drop gaming who had done some great work already and I had no idea they would look at me and say that but this is wrong I'm leaving do we have moments where just like in a real football match from momentum goes our way how much were having to struggle a little bit and then pick it back up and get everybody back in the game do we have this team that came out from America Rob Miller he got this guy called Sam and he's attracted Lee the first raise volume another 50% while training them you have to also be careful that you don't over train them and train them because they have to perform at the same time field goal of cycling with them and you just cycle and all and stuff that time as well swimming we did a lot of classes they start from Basics how to dive tell me the most difficult thing this distance triathlon eventually when I saw the triathlon I was like God is that going to think I'm an absolutely genius filmmaker that is shortest spot so when I have to say that my contribution to that spot all of zero I have not had nothing to do with the football or the tripod on full credit to the add team of the film coupled with play the sports team that rule from America that make sure they shot the film and we didn't look really authentic and then finally credit I think to deeper who got it you're so brilliantly and geniously that it made me look good I really think that this is the most sporty and masculine friendly film I have ever ever there's always a woman protagonist who's strong this is also besides the love story that works very well of romance it's really about the boys and their friendship and their journey and what love does to them you have a very good Knack of not carrying the baggage of being current there is a hint and a sense of something that is not correct with yogurt and that has been very well talk to me by Karan thank you Karen for doing this for me I also had a great experience working with Ronnie Troy Ram Kapoor go to me Ram's wife all of them very very important parts yes tremendous amount of confidence in himself he knows exactly what he wants and he knows how to get it extremely comfortable working with him into he makes people so comfortable is a technician student of the year is Karen's most directorial film this film has been shot happy only because we never really are and everyone's really screaming and shouting and trying to get the work done but this felt like I was I was an old in high school so this was what I call my quintessential holiday review
