what's the most painful Ventures we endured either in theaters or the otd platform the most fascinating part about the movies that I'm going to be mentioning in this video add majority of these films are either installments of franchise is nobody asked for or reboots and remakes of classic films that in today's Times play if not enhanced or designed to the sensibilities of the 21st centuries will just come across as ignorant and outdated without wasting a lot of worst Bollywood movies and performances of 2020 number 8 goes to Lavagirl one of the story stories have had on me while I was going through my personal battles but when I see surface level treatment and rather disorderly way this when we felt that the fate of a story like Lavagirl would have not transpired to become a train wreck that it was had the performances of the film been very con the phone number for both actors and Sara Ali Khan to Showcase Rangers performers especially recap into their emotional and vulnerable play Karthik was a hit and miss throughout the film Sara completely faltered to communicate the internal conflict of Zoe convincing 7499 could not rescue this sinking ship and audiences eventually were left with the same reactions that they had when they saw a little confused and utterly disappointed number 7 goes to baaghi 3 and installment no one wished for but the Indian this is with that money resulting into massive box office collections of the previous film made sure that the creators had enough confidence to rip off another Tamil film baaghi 3 the remake of the 2012 inventory baggy 3 worked with the same formula as its previous firms taken already successful model put it to a different location make sure you cater the story to the image of the action star Tiger Shroff and the Indian audience will come pouring into theaters baaghi 3 however transitioned into testing the intelligence of the Indian audience almost mocking it by showcasing a story that is borderline insane send a docile brother for paperwork to Syria who gets kidnapped and well let's make it a one-man versus an entire city in Rogue group that has play the ammunition and arms maybe any capable army in the world possesses a landscape where there is an ongoing Civil War considered to be one of the listen to 21st century in real life but Tiger Shroff shirtless will come save the day and everything shouts his name just like Jaya Bachchan from K3 is Spidey senses with tingle and tiger would appear it was over the top bizarre unintentionally funny but what do I know they're already I need to make baaghi 4 best of luck to everyone number 6 goes to Hindu Ki jawani a less crash version of Virgin bhanupriya if is a compliment that recently released was the Kiara advani and Aditya seal star in the kitchen that really saddened me not for its brain content most is comedy but the actors associated with it and the potential they really have a premise of a girl struggling to get laid in ghaziabad do transitions to lay focus on dating apps only to get caught up in a national security Hazard who is painful to say the least to take the list ring a pandemic to watch this in theaters was really putting your life on the line but at the cost of your own mental health as I said in my review for the film that I really talented individuals who are terribly wasted in a horrible in this case I understand the law for an actor like Kiara to do mean leaves in films especially in the commercial space but at the same part of associating bad projects with the actor this one was truly forgettable number 5 goes to Mrs serial killer affirm that falls into the category of being so bad that it's good was undoubtedly the series called the directed which turned out to be an unintentional comedy Mrs serial killer really made this is wonder what exactly did Netflix see when the green lived the project when you have action sequences where Poland is being thrown in a girl goes on lutang mode from Mortal Kombat literally flying in the air as it being her own version of a nainital actress and the capability to even make what is like Manoj bajpayee overact then you know this from deserves to be on the list of Ventures we want to forget about presented as Jacqueline's play serious acting it definitely should have led to the actors and creators to go back to the drawing board and understand that they are totally disconnected from is considered to be compelling Cinema number for goes to Lakshmi the remake of the rock of Lawrence film starring Akshay Kumar in the lead role was destined to be lock my fans for two reasons the picture of which the original Tamil film was presented in 2011 who did the commercial treatment which was the norm of the and secondly the effectiveness of the same pitch for a straight digital release is a clear example for product being presented in a place where there aren't what's the most to purchase it Lakshmi was over the top loud and annoying many viewers pausing it in several moments to catch a breather while how much does make you wonder whether it would have financially worked as a theatrical release many of its moments catered to single screen sensibilities play on Disney plus All Star Wars definitely a fish out of the ocean trying to understand its bearings Sharad kelkar powerful performance also could not when is winter from drowning number 3 goes to Sonic 2 one of the ventures where I honestly had no idea what to expect was the Mahesh Bhatt directed what is technically set 30 years after the original film we find Ravi Kishore Verma grieving the loss of his wife and the answer can I hear a box upon with Alia Bhatt and the terror what follows is the current keeping characters brainwashed owls that attack on command world leaders roaming around half naked and a character named dilip had cutter who doesn't have a hand wow sorry to eventually find out to be way worse than many had envisioned and still stuck in the 90s both from a storytelling point of view as well as the misinformed perspective about mental health the only take away of the film was it sold for music but it's always a train wreck to watch capable actors be a part of horrible script shut up to was truly unbearable number 2 goes to Coolie number one something that is fresh and everyone's memory is the recently released from Kohli number I mean what can I say now that I have not already stated in my review the true test of the Indian audience actually progressing from such the movie released in theaters as the film is a digital release and has been banned by everyone and deservedly so I think we can only wait watch when there is some form of normalcy to really understand if we have truly grown up and can reject such dated and funny number one is another case of talented children being associated with projects of their parents more due to the relationship find banking on the Nostalgia of the original films rather than what should dictate anyone signing on the dotted line the story cool one has to be one of the most embarrassing ventures of 2020 and number one goes to Virgin bhanupriya unbearable is an understatement regarding this from the movie stands for everything socially problematic I'll just make my point by verbatim telling you about two scenes a best any advice is the girl desperate to lose her virginity on how to get freaky in bed she tells her feminine it goes in a panic mode she asked for more advice the best friend tells her hold his hand or regular turn main character asks do you want me to rape him to watch the girl says the film is the accurate representation of what we want to forget about Hindi Cinema it's grass vulgar and socially responsible it annoyed infuriated me that these firms get funding and get promoted honestly no one should go through this and that was a video guys right down in 2020 please don't forget to follow me on Instagram in front of you follow me a Jammy pants for
