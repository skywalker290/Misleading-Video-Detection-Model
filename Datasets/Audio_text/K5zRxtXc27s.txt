video agree that after 3 years this is the obviously this is the one why not mainstream I would agree with you that after 3 Idiots this is my other really big mainstream film coming out so it's almost been 4 years now exactly 4 years because 3 Idiots are released on Christmas exactly and this is coming on Christmas again 20th December Christmas week so it's been 4 years since 3 Idiots talash I feel was kind of a middle of the part it was mainstream in some ways even when we were making the film we knew that this is going to appeal to a certain section of the audience 3DS in 202 figure which is universal across all the all the trade analysts and everywhere but do you have a benchmark as to a which is the film that that you have to because there have been a lot of discrepancy in terms of box office figures these days what is the figure that you're looking at because for 3 years it's University I'm that doesn't interest me what interests me is winning the heart of the audience I would interest me is that when you sit in the theatre and and you know figures can be very misleading so figures can be used to a certain extent g how much people have like to feel my question is about the correct box office figures so there are two aspects to it when is the people misreport that's something that just the total box office I don't think always gives you a correct picture so I'll give an example of my own films of 202 that is the total business of the film in India in India and at that time it open for the time 4 years back when it open 40 around 40 crores roughly was the weekend so if that's the weekend and it was a big weekend it was the biggest weekend ever today we release films in 4 when does 40 crores in the first 3 days the weekend the first three days and then it goes on to 200 crores so you'll realise that it's 40 into 5 reaches 200 so it's done 5 times what it did in its first three days because second let's assume same film 3 Idiots has done the same amount weekend into 2 is not a good sign in my opinion we can you define this unbelievable weekend into 3 is good 3 1/2 is very good 4 is very very good for an hour is mind blowing in 5 years unbelievable very small so I don't remember the audience is grown for myself how many screens is it dhoom 3 coming in I don't whatever whatever the capacity is today of number of screens I don't think we would can you do that and the ticket prices are being hacked that's what being said I said no ticket prices same as because the ticket prices for height for Chennai and that's what the ticket prices are now Chennai Express and I think Chris so that's the look for a big film I think that's what the ticket prices are now I'm not a market guy so I may be wrong so don't check with me I don't believe in using my time in that manner money doesn't interest me I want you to I want to tell you that the prices in any case are not in the hands of the actor it's not in the hands of the producer it's not even in the hands of the distributor are you aware of this is a question you should be asking the various you know Multiplex change the screen anup pandey from Arun pandey from my hair stylist Ivan was trying to do how to strip my hair all the colour and she wanted to work on a blank empty canvas as she put it so first she bleach call Golden copper or something something starting shaded it so it's my hair is brown and then there's a lighter Brown streak all the time you know this question has been asked me now for the last 5 years and I give the same answer first of all I have to thank my parents because what I am today is you know dependent I don't do too much to look after myself but what I do I'm too stressed I just can't
