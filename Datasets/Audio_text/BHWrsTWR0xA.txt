I've been engaged of so many times I've been married of many many times I cheated on Italy you're excited I can't tell you how much joy it gives me which Ranbir call Papa I'm on my way typical congratulations on Pandora thank you the success of the film I think positions you as the most powerful woman in Bollywood it's never been about now what I think whatever I feel I felt even some years ago which is send me some intention with the intention to bring about some sort of change to be able to impact people's lives with happiness and positivity maybe some amount of Guidance with with what I get to do I think I get to learn a lot and maybe with speaking about my journey on my experiences all the films that I do if I'm able to how are people I think that has always been my intention so I think with the success of the film feel like it just sort of further amplifies that platform it will change things for women in the film industry but it was so vilified for its own gender politics when something like that happens do you step back and say okay maybe here's another way to look at it did it give you any other perspective the intention of doing padmaavat was for people to realize that there woman with that sort of spirit can you use to be big and she says I am big it's the pictures that got small now as you get bigger and bigger how you make sure that the rules have the same business that they have the meat and the heft give me meaningful you know like I said I think I think I need to find that connect so it's not about how it's not literally how big or small the film is it's not budget related it's not bud in my humble opinion I feel that's a mistake that a lot of people make that more success comes more responsibility and so you have to start changing things in your life which is Huawei you are because of certain things that you've done or certain things that you believed in so to remember your and to go back to and keep reminding yourself of why you are here and what is it and what are those decisions or what does thought so who are those people who have helped you get to where you are that's the way I look at it so there's no sense of now I can't do this no not at all no number one and all that know I think like I said I think it's important for me to always remember what is it that I did that that brought me I think if I had to sum it up in one line I think it would be to not forget my roots and I think I add in so many ways whether it's remembering I think in my personal life and my professional life I think in so many please I think that line just sums up everything and I hope that doesn't change while I think people's perception is changing or has changed again that brings me back to my earlier point which is if people perceive me a certain way or can attribute certain things to me because of the work that I've done or it's because of being an artist inherently who I am and that's what that's the foundation you know you don't forget that you know I know you don't like to talk about to kind of get how do you do that I don't know it just happened he said he said that I used you know that you used to be a very shy person which I still am I still am maybe I'm better equipped today to handle it maybe I'm I've play shy and awkward is is how I describe last name came over that I think one of the my my biggest I think play mistakes that I made was to add bring it on screen as well and sort of carried that consciousness and then I think with a little bit maybe in lavage girl or directors who why is that I was that I was shy in front of the camera and understood how to sort of break that they did sing on my own I think I realized it during cocktail and then you know changed it after that which is I more free in front of the camera and I was able to engage and be a different person and not not be inhibited play and while I am awkward I think I have worked on it I think I've become better with it over the years I think a lot of it also has to do with the way I've been brought up you've met my parents and there's a certain way they they speak in a certain way they carry themselves and and that's sort of I think the same way they've brought up my sister and me as well so in the last year you completed 10 years of being an actor have you creative instincts the process is the same because it's always been extinct I think the only difference is that what's the what times when I be tempted to do films because it just sounded like trip later but this is a great announcement I have been tempted in the past two films like that but I think part of the success you know I think what comes with success is confidence and I think that confidence with that confidence I'm able tell myself that no it's fine like the way I approached my work so far is the right way to go about it for myself it could be different for different people but this is what works for me and so today if I'm if someone's trying to give me otherwise I'm very sure of my instincts yeah but can success be paralyzing in any way are you like is there a fear that if anything I think it's made me feel a lot more confident it's made me feel a lot more free the ability to take risks the ability to Express no it doesn't feel like a burden it really feels I feel empowered I feel free have a life of happy domestic City I just can't see that that maybe I change a little bit it's too much a part of my life that I can walk away from it I think the fact that the Domesticity home parents family play children you know staying connected Roots all of that is very important for me I feel very but yes I think I think today I can see how I can I can be a working wife for a working mother and still do what I love doing I felt like maybe I felt like that at that point because I was working so much and I had this thing of okay now I just need to but I can see myself balancing that now and I think I drive myself and people around me crazy it didn't work that's what I said I'll be completely so you have to work so what is how do you just not want to go there I've been engaged off so many times turn off you know many many times but you know it is what it is and I I don't think is any point in sort of fighting it you know it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's most definitely something that will happen in my life at some it is a very important I'd say Institution for me in the way that I've seen my and my uncles and aunts and in the way that I've been brought up so I'm not going to say that oh like you marriage doesn't mean anything to me or but at the same time I know that when it is the right time I feel it advocate for mental health and I saw somewhere you were talking about how you know it's it's it's it's it's it's how do you kind of tame the Beast that the social media world is I think how much we consume it everyday all the time similarly but unfortunately or fortunately because we have our phones on us all the time and see this I think earlier if maybe be an awkward silence for some time but then you start talking to each other but now you don't need to make conversation with people because I can pretend to be busy or actually be busy on my phone or actually keep myself occupied so you know it is about moderation and how you know while there are amazing upsides to to social media today it's literally brought the world closer it's also isolating us because we're not engaging with people around I think there are moments where you don't feel great about yourself because you're seeing somebody else put up a version of of their life very very few people maybe like half a percent of people will actually put up a post of them crying performance it's just a very very miniscule part of of somebody's life but when but when that's the only thing you're projecting you sort of I'm doing like is this happening only to somebody else and why is my life not as amazing and so it's it's are you purposefully sort of are you mindful of how long you're not addicted to what's my thoughts and my feelings and so when I do feel like I'm going down that route I will quietly put my phone away in my house or do something there are now very powerful women like Meryl Streep and the producer Shonda Rhimes and Reese Witherspoon of donated a lot of money to which is sort of attempting at a systemic level to fight the discrimination against women in in the film industry that what's important for it to be gender-neutral not just for women there are some men that need to be protected as well so I don't think I don't think this should become a battle of of male versus female I think it's about right versus wrong talk now for you like what are the choices you're going to be making well there was this one with Vishal that I was doing which isn't as of now but I do feel like there's certain energies that I want to sort of spend in a particular direction as far as films are concerned and I think I'm looking for that you still want to do a nice romantic yes meaningful but I can't tell you the number of people who have come up to me and said can you do another one I wish it fell in my lap come on you to pick up you don't have romantic scripts to choose from people aren't making money yes everyone's doing biopics for some reason I don't know why and sports biopics why is everyone trying to make a sports you just want you you want something that's like that comes at the heart yeah a little bit you don't like like fun light how are you what are you doing right now so they're doing at the house and I'm helping them do that I'm putting my house in order which is a never-ending thing and I love doing so it's not for me it's not stressful or it's not a chore I enjoy doing that setting up my office so it was you know the mountain taking care of all of that losing the accounts books and over accounts and just just paperwork paperwork because I need to clean every few clean my definitely clean my cupboards every few months otherwise there's just so many clothes and they're just so I can't tell you how much joy it gives me I like my perfect day would be wake up in the morning have my South Indian breakfast go down to the gym you were very happy about I was so happy I didn't know there was a world and it was trending for 2 days do you have the South Indian breakfast and then what would you do on this is perfect day go to the gym then come back then have can vegetable juice now I'm telling you like proper details then then either do some sort of work which Ranbir call Putt-Putt because he feels like I can never sit in one place in the office or in the house I have to do something then I'll have lunch then again I'll do something sing something and then evenings depends maybe a massage maybe not Netflix dinner talk to my parents so that's one kind of day the other kind of days go down to the come back meetings meetings meetings meetings narration narrations narrations all of that evening Netflix dinner that's what I'm doing now it's delightful but I need turn off the lights off the Four Seasons Hotel you remember that party what was it for we were all asking gold just for fun because I remember you having fun it was a message play all in one room I just felt like I'd never ever met everyone together right and it was just a celebration he does try very hard to seek my but I think in life it's very important to be honest can I have fun in the light film happens thank you thank you if you like this video subscribe to film companion
