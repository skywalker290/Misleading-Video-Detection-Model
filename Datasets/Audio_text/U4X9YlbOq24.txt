interview is to celebrate 7 years of you in Hindi Cinema wake up in the morning and I just didn't feel good like weather in India music I've been very fortunate and I was success is it right because when you're making a film like and it's 10:00 we all know that it's it's it's not going to make that kind of money because it's convention in that way but you did it because like you believed in that in that in that in that film in that story and this thing that made me really like feel like I have done it's it's control because one thing I have experience is that what you want as an actor also I've always been very very vocal about things right whichever might it's about actually the being able to create something being able to bring people together have a different point of view who are telling a story which is unique and to be able to play while we have these corporations that are there in the studios big studios which are which are here but you know what happens is I really like gets me going so the ability to be able to do that you know I think that is very very rewarding and I feel very grateful for you but it's also percent of the directors for the 100 top grossing films 1.9 excluding Art House divisions major Studios have released play films last year done by a female director between all Studios three films in 2014 1995 % 77% of producers in Hollywood on Main Indian films have a significantly higher prevalence of sexualization of female characters there are the absolute bottom as far as speaking characters are concerned they show female characters in less than 1/4 of all speak English I mean to be like good looking if there's a boy desirable discrimination will you be able to bring start bringing me that much money for the film would still get paid more than me because he's a guy because all else being equal he will still make more money and you know what it's not like that I guess today I would honestly I would say that how did the way to do it it's just there it's just in it's like you know it's a national championship I want to be able to leave we're seeing all kinds of films this is a change right like because people are being able to what is changing a setup that is changing our industry because now we have a festival so if it becomes really really really really really really really really really really really cute accepting a woman doing this like you usually see Heroes men are doing this kind of which are we need to have that see by doing a thing like that she has what is put a thought in someone's head about that see the power we have as play something that you think you deserve you are a bitch there's no mathematics she has attitude I would love to have a conversation with all of them so if they're like that think about it if you are working from a place where it's some kind of prejudice that you have in your head or some preconceived notion you have in your head then and that's why how big is risk that's true they are all of you I mean all of you guys are the ones that are slightly play I'm really happy that shadow is doing fine how do you say sorted when when you're at the center of these kind of ridiculous stuff you know when you're at the center of a what do you tell yourself at that point to just ignore the noise and say just keep your eyes on the back that myself that if I start to listen to these people and start to let them decide how I should behave and what I should do control I feel I feel like you know targeted sometimes but you know but how do lips lip thing done in all of that and you know and I was thinking like I didn't think it was Brave keep it like real and you know and then your life is easy listening this industry when you know it's always up or down it's very extreme my relationships relationship that I would say is normal because we both don't want to become you know in your life will go on your life will go on I'm going to start reading my life according to you I screwed my life turn the camera so it's fine that's ok Google and we want to have a sense of you know reality like we both come from very similar backgrounds we both come from regular play jazz families without any help from anybody in the respective Industries we have reached where we have reached in our life so first it has would you like respect for one another and you know we're still those people only right so it's like which is the weather in Central Europe we have no interest in that because they feel uncomfortable uncomfortable doing that and tell me before we end you talking about the when is actually I don't know really really exciting it's a very different kind of a con Monica how long is it I guess not do anything lower to 20% and we are also trying to make a film so he has written an amazing thank you so much thank you this is such a wonderful child subscribe to the film companion Channel hit the button below to get your phone fix
