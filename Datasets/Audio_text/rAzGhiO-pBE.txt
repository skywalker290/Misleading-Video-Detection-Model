where's that is more important than that relationship number one is the one you have with yourself you know what I mean I never said this before so I'm not even sure whether it makes sense but lighting and loving yourself doesn't your partner to own who they are and to be the best of who they are it's part of the world that you have I love that do you like any of these I think you look good
