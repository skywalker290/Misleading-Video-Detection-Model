what are the most anticipated marriages of this year is the marriage of Alia and Ranbir but looks like everything is not between these lovebirds well recently they were reports doing rounds that Ranbir and Alia will get married after the release of the first movie together from hazra the report suggested that the family members have already invited please I told them to be free on those dates it is also said that both the families have started preparing play marriage reports also said that Alia has already ordered her lehenga to sabyasachi they were also reports suggesting that they have selected their honeymoon destination but just after please off this reports coming in Limelight news also started doing round that everything is not well between these two love birds what the stars have finished filming for brahmastra and currently they are busy with their next projects who is currently shooting for Sanjay Leela bhansali's gangubai kathiawadi and ranveer has started shooting for his next movie shamshera it is also said that both the stars are also shooting their respective films at the same Film Studio but the my friend but what is surprising that they are not meeting each other in spite of being at the same this incident is quite surprising because Ali and Ranbir always accompanied each other wherever Ranbir when he visited his ill father Rishi Kapoor at a hospital spotted with Ranbir but what happened now that they are maintaining distance from each other there are many questions coming in the Limelight right now that if Ranbir has jumped earlier or if only I cheated on Ranbir many people are also thinking that the relationship was just a publicity stunt sending to be in a relationship just to promote the business of the movie but nothing has been confirmed now from their many people are also assuming that they are keeping their personal and professional life separate and by being professional they are not meeting each other on the sets of their movies add this adorable couple does not part their ways leave your thoughts in comment section and subscribe our channel for updates
