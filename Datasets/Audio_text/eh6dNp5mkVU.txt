are you an introvert or an extrovert today we're going to find out who's the fake introvert I'm really excited to watch this video because I find a lot of times I talk to people and they're like oh yeah I'm totally introvert I love like sitting home and watching a movie I would consider myself both introvert and extrovert yes that's a thing I feel like you can tell sometimes when I make videos with other people it's incredibly awkward but sometimes I can do stuff on stage it's so epically natural 6 introvert one Secret let's freaking go you believe everyone knows introverts can't talk they cannot communicate what are they saying here that's so weird I wonder how people react make me a this is the result I feel like that's a misconception where at least in my experience I feel like I'm comfortable with silence and a lot of people aren't especially in America I found that the conversations with when in reality I don't think just my opinion and also very boring I'd rather be quiet okay this is play angry and we're only halfway silent round why is he not looking at her it's so weird okay I guess we have to judge just like based on appearance if I had he's just an appearance she sings the most introverted maybe these two as well I don't know her I don't know all right I want to see more if anyone else did that I don't know because I just felt like everybody was like trying to look into my soul and like determine if I was a an introvert or not okay so you guys voted the one in the middle interesting interesting all right fare do they vote right away just based on that what I really appreciate the what is it called the nature of a grasshopper sound really to fully fully extend the awkwardness take my dog to the dog park stuff like that she likes to watch tiktok she looks like the part at least that doesn't make you an introvert does it I don't think it does I feel like she dressed up as this is how being able to recharge and next song back to a place where I can interact with people every time I would like to paint sometimes like go to the beach or hike spending time in nature introvert would not something like that you know what I mean they wouldn't say something that would seem more extroverted like going outside am I right they would be like oh I like to sit yeah yeah I like watch Netflix find creative Outlets next song I like video I bit my fucking lip and it hurts every time I talk to you like nobody bothered me nobody like knock on my door again they came across as more like confident or more introverted people can't be confident it's just completely impossible I guess it's such a broad thing everyone what kind of question is that where is everyone that sent it over to prefers texting exactly I was trying to just say something so I wasn't voted off too early hardest part of being an introvert meeting new people 5 years my only friend is like my friend from high school yeah that seems about accurate I can I can relate to that meeting new people who has time for that anyway let's get real here Camila giving speeches yesterday pause no one likes public speaking no one doesn't matter if you're extra play introvert I don't like to speak in front of these people now no one lies I just freaked out for me it's like in large group settings feeling overlooked or like not considered since I'm not immedi do you like vocal about all my opinions and stuff so like I'm thinking about it and like composing my thoughts and want to say stuff but you know sometimes in those situations everyone talks over and then the moment goes away I'm not like this but I know other people that are introvert that I told me that they feel like this so far I don't trust the girl with the dirty jeans broken jeans and the girl with the flower skirt those two do not between Emma and Maya you guys don't deserve money introverts don't deserve money I'm going to say it you know what introvert this Airport baby came across as like outgoing so they may be pinpointed me for that I can see that I can see that in Sweden we I'm expecting a lot of house in the mass right now someone tell me about like if I don't know the order I was seriously clueless so I thought I was going to be out once they start doing that I don't know where it's I've Been Told what are ice cream intimidating at first since I'm so like reserved and I have like my shell like the reason I brought it up is because like a lot of people I'm really confident in myself like I know who I am but that doesn't mean so they sure are but are in 100 percent an introvert or 100% an extrovert we all have like Tendencies of both because true true that's a giving that's a given determined factor I feel like extroverted people cannot shut the fuck up about introverted people only really talk when they they know and I'm comfortable with someone is that correct I feel like I'm correct about that I'm why is everyone talking to me stop talking to me we don't do that you talk to someone like oh oh oh oh oh oh oh well that means you're boring around people that think that you are boring around doesn't it I'm really funny I swear I just have fun with other people I'm not all right I really think these strongly that these three are safe I voted for Alex because introverts cannot have fun at parties impossible I see what you mean but introverts go to party and they cry they cry every time continue continue continue wow the confidence so Maya thinks for sure that she knows everyone is out interesting how do you guys go about dating I have a girlfriend but they're both introverts and we're both really independent we know like when to give each other space and like we need to recharge like we don't have to constantly talk all the time play I'm an introvert to write I swear I swear liar myself and do what I want on my free time without anybody getting offended of why I don't want them around do you know so yeah true truth I relate to this so much I need my space I don't know I really don't know someone is a really good nervous and kind of anxious did you like guys not heard from Jake Paul anxiety go to sleep cuz I have like insomnia like I can't go to sleep and so like I'll play like the meditation music on YouTube that has nothing to do with introvert where to buy Kingdom Hearts people with introvert cannot shut the fuck up about their anxiety I'm just kidding I'm joking I'm joking that was too hard who is it going to be I bet it was the first guy they got him right away or something I was pretty upset because I thought we had it play the sociopath Jesus Christ like I feel like there's a lot of misconceptions like oh wow okay all right when's the next conceptions about being like an introvert or an introvert typically I need to go back to introverts just get energy from watching some Netflix as they were saying that's true I feel like I'm both though I can get energy from other people as well it's just like if it's too much I get overwhelmed and I don't like it I want what percent more extroverted introverts and show that like thank you Alex I feel so much better about myself if there's no one else like me then who am I well done for leave it there Alex because I can see him having fun parties socially awkward internet I still like talking to people having fun I just need some time alone to charge so maybe I'm just awkward around people maybe that's subscribe and hit the Bell button for videos every single Play We also now have the G fuel gay clubs at Shaker cups and they are available
