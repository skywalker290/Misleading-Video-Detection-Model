it talks about mental health it talks about abuse what a short film does is that you know if people talk about the subject a lot more so like yourself it's getting support from the press or people who are watching it online or just the audiences you know they can refer it's just drop off points on main feature film sometimes is minute 12 and you're like ok so you know there is a growing market is going to take several award shows where this is a legit category people are getting recognised careers how many metres are actors and actresses who Who start off or use this as a showcase for me like you know I was coming if there was any other short film that was offered to me during the lockdown I'm not ability dealt with mental health and abuse as an actor I've always been talking about love stories I feel like play Jack boxes is that you know if you've got to own your sexuality and I get the opportunity of dealing with a play Paris that can go right or wrong and to to be able to do it with a maker like Karan Johar light off and on song like baby and you know to talk about the unfortunate rape culture that and it's it's just it shakes you up it just shakes you up so many different levels and at the level of an actor also I still remember when we were shooting the film and then you know it's the last seen and because the films come out about you know what happened so and and then to draw parallels with society that this exists is so scary important message about mental health and the growing numbers and the emotional abuse at any level is abuse the sooner you come to terms with it the better it is for you there's no need to be in a toxic relationship and by that I don't mean it's a relationship a man and a woman or it's a relationship between husband wife girlfriend abuse can happen anywhere I in this one you also talked about what relationship between a father and a son and you know the frustrations that once gone through during lockdown there's also the director of the film we were sitting in my living room as we did it's not how do I help that woman who's not even talking about it right how do you do that like you know there are some unfortunate women who think that the only he comes back home takes his frustration out on her ABUS probably physically and the kids are fast asleep in the other room and they don't know that you know this is happening to the mum and the two children that she's giving birth to from this man are probably going to be how do I help that woman a conversations are great but how can we do that there are you know people doing some amazing work when they get to know that you know other people are I'm getting uncomfortable with the presence of their partners in a room or you know your friends are getting distant or you know if you see that you language around that person that's that's where that's where the culture starts from right don't what happened to people around you you know somehow pick up on the signs so it's just none of it I what I'm trying to say is that none of it is ok we work every day in our in our lives towards just so hard it's so hard to come to terms with it
