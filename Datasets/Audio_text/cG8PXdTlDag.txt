hey what's up guys I'm going to be HD here airpods Pro I guess a lot of people care about these airpods became the most popular headphones on planet Earth pretty quickly within about two or three years of them coming out and so smartly apples decided to follow up with and capitalize on that with a professional version of them AKA one with noise cancellation and a couple new features they're pretty good so we all know they're $250 and they're not actually replacing airpods to as much as sing on the site alongside them and so they're not just the new airpods but they're also the best of airpods so in that Impressions video I went over each of the Play features of airpods pro and what it does and so now that I've been using them for about a week it's time to go over how good each of those things the ever so memorable new design I think they're fine I'm not really in love with any by Design at the moment so really any improvement from airpods 2 is good to see so the stems here are shorter which is good it technically brings microphone further from your mouth but they sound just as good for phone calls then at the bottom of the stem you have a force sensor instead the touch sensor now so you're squeezing to play pause double squeezing to move to the next track long squeeze to turn on what is cancellation it was annoying at first because the shortest stem is a bit closer to the side of your head the way they fit but then I got used to is squeezing the sides normally the only bummer is there's no volume control from the buds at all I honestly think that might be my least favorite thing what about the design I really don't want to have to ask Siri to change the volume every time hands-free maybe that's just me anyway play fit into this landscape magnetic case that honestly is still pretty small it's bigger than the old airpods case but it's easily fits in a pocket and a lot of other wireless earbuds cases have come through the studio lately and they're consistently typically much bigger put on the airpods case to the point where some of them aren't even really pocketable I can still fit the airpods pro case in the tiny pocket I never use inside the pocket in my jeans so yeah not a problem here but of course the most important difference with airpods Pro is the Silicon tips instead of the hard plastic going into your ears turns out to be a major win for a lot of people like me who literally can't wear regular airpods for more than about 3 minutes before they're just sliding out these actually stay in my ears I can walk around move more than normal workout and I create a nice little seal and that's already a big functional difference but the important thing for earbuds people is that the seal isn't uncomfortable so typically when you put earbuds like this into your ears you're also pushing air into your ear two which can be uncomfortable because it creates a bit of pressure there but with airpods Pro the pass-through cut out that lets air through Eliza's pressure and by the time you're wearing them and honestly makes it easy to forget you're wearing earbuds even for someone like me who doesn't wear earbuds very often which is impressive so you get them in your ear they're comfortable they solve the first major problem which is staying in your ear the next question is how do they sound so I have two answers when the noise cancellation is off they sound just like regular airpods you're fine when noise cancellation is on they do sound dramatically better airpods Pro get really loud to the point where I never need them at full volume and most if not all the improvements in the actual sound are as a direct result of you having a decent seal now instead of Lucille at all before all for you to Quinn from snazzy labs for an audio files perspective on exactly how airpods sound it describe them as mid heavy and I completely agree but I'll let you check out his excellent video I'll link it below so that being said let's talk about that noise cancellation this is its biggest strength so there's three modes noise canceling off and transparency mode and the noise cancellation is really impressive to me with earbuds they do well in noisy environments but they're at their best with you know more consistent white noise so something like the din of a coffee shop or being in a car on a road trip or even on airplane you know I was just thinking about it recently this because of the feature set being so unique this is I think my only pair of please canceling open back earbuds just very strange but I do love that they do you can't control the level of noise cancellation but it makes everything sound better and people who previously have only used you know airpods or other headphones that don't do this will love these then there is transparency mode which I almost was play impressed by so he uses the microphones built in to pass through audio around you and it's this really natural-sounding pass through with maybe a little bit of hiss or exaggeration at the high end but in general it sounds like you're just not wearing anything in your ears at all which makes it easier forget that you're wearing them so this is a good mood if you're you know walking or running next to a road or you're on a plane waiting to hear the announcements or just generally I don't want to be totally isolated from your environment just on mode in the middle which doesn't really do anything crazy with noise cancellation or transparency it just what time is the earbuds on and saves a bit of battery this one just sounds like you're wearing airpods with silicone tips not amazing for battery overall for airpods pro Apple says 4 1/2 hours with noise canceling or trans play on 5 hours with noise-canceling off I kept it on all the time I got about 4 hours that's not a full flight sometimes which is interesting but the quick charge in the case is at least convenient so if you do get low you can plug in for a 2 minutes and get an hour of charge out of that and they charge via lightning so a couple other FAQs number one do they work with Android yes now they will again not be the best for Android they lose some of the convenience features the autoplay pause of course integration but they do work as bluetooth earbuds can you use third-party custom silicon tips or replace them with tips that you might like better know as far as I know this connection between the earbud is actually proprietary so definitely try not to lose because you're stuck with what comes in the box or you can go for the $4 replacement tips straight from Apple surprisingly reasonably are they good for workouts sure I've done it they are sweatproof technically their ipx4 water resistant which means can sweat on them and they survived for me but if I was looking specifically for workout headphones I would look more towards something like the Powerbeats Pro which specifically stay in my ear better and get beat up more and be fine but if you want just one pair of earbuds to be fine for everything yes these survive a workout better than the previous airpods so then are airpods pro the best wireless earbuds yes but no but yes but no like there are headphones that sound better the Sony w 1,000 xm3s for example terrible name these do sound better than the airpods they also have better noise cancellation than airpods Pro they also have a longer battery life than airpods Pro they also have better customization in their app than airpods Pro like these are technically better headphones for sure but the airpod Pro Nail so many things about Everyday Use like the case size for one that's a pretty dramatic difference and also as dumb as these might look there are some other designs that are way dumber and you do get used to the stock thing and it just stop being natural and of course the fast charging is convenient and the H1 ship so that it pairs instantly with any iPhone you want and then the rest of the Apple ecosystem and it blending in with iOS 13 so well all this stuff more than the next up for it they're not audiophile grade headphones they're not great dedicated workout headphones they're not the perfect headphones for flying but if I could only pick one pair of earbuds to do all this stuff with I would pick airpods Pro and a lot of people are going to make that choice perfectly perfect is that a word that's probably not a word but you know what that's still going to be the title so that's been it that's my airpods Pro review you're really good and just for fun since y'all made it this far if you head over to Twitter I'm going to be giving away a second pair of airpods so you can check these airpods Pro of course the headphones and the case only come in white so you might as well get some color going and customize the so you know exactly which one is yours when they start showing up everywhere details will be below but yeah sometime in the next 24 hours look for that tweet infinite thank you for watching catch you guys next one piece
