first impressions I had a short amount of time smartphones in a while I had intentions to I had a couple of different devices come across the table as I may switching completely and shifting everything over you know it's sometimes you're device the oneplus I was enjoying using this particular phone maybe the one thing that's not especially stand out on it is the camera I think I'm probably pounds in the best way to do it is to change completely and exclusively and to put the main SIM card into that next device I'm going to do the usual thing and of course is the Aura glow with the the magical grad some people they don't like this that much I saw some people in the comments I like oh that's that's gross but like in all honesty the pictures in all the colours like that that's only in a certain type of reflection that you see that most of the time reflective almost like a mirror that kind of most of the time so I guess that's important to put out there something I'm excited for right away is getting wireless charging back because most of the devices are used leading up to this oneplus had wireless charging oneplus for whatever reason so reluctant to put the wireless charging it when here we go plastic off the back it's got a 4300 million power battery I'm interested to see how that pans out in relationship to the very big display and all the other fingerprints it's I mean if I put in a right light that's a lot of fingerprint so I'm probably going to look for some sort of a case for this of course the pen has some things change times change so on it ships with a fast charger I believe this is a 25 watt fast charger this thing be capable of charging a lot quicker than that you can get it up to 40 Watts I believe is that correct well 45 Watt type c cable type c to c and then a micro USB to type c adaptor you got to like having the extra no longer has a headphone jack s series had it and then it was kind of set of AKG earbuds that utilise the type c connector they could have included some Galaxy buds I've heard of some order promotions that are going to include Galaxy buds and then of course the other benefit with the Galaxy buds is because this thing has reversed wireless charging nonetheless you get a free pair with a big upgrade on the typical included earbuds so I'm glad they put it in play phone Jack would have been better but you get this for a wired headphone if need be that of course over on the right that's a what's 7 pro you can see because they hid the front facing camera in the motorised component that's what you end up with screen to body rat the hole punch is shrunk down I said it in my hands on video it's not as big what is an S series devices I like the fact that the hole punch on the other ones was hidden up in the corner where it's not real estate you typically anyways but there is something to be said for symmetry as well from a design perspective it's kind of pleasing and it's smaller but of course the time has come take Lily for the price of course this one on the left going to be a few more bucks than the one that I'm leaving on the right it's hard to know it's hard to say that this is going laugh for me up that extended a functionality that's worthwhile for the extended cost so the SIM card comes out goodbye over here okay moment has come now keep in mind it's the main SIM card I'm not one of these guys having multiple cards out there so all the phones are running in the pockets at the same time when I switch to another smartphone that becomes my smartphone exclusively I think it's the best way to test these things you live your life with this new smartphone and then you can report back on sort of how you feel about it now with the new show downstairs the Lou later show which is longer form conversation I feel like I can hit you guys with updates along play as I transition to the daily life with the latest note series in this case the plus version of it I'm a nope Twitter
