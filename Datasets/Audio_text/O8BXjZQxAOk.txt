pressures and the opportunities presented by social media and revealed play the last starstruck they also addressed the prickly issue of nepotism in Bollywood the assembled for the newcomers Round Table gentleman ladies this time last year you were relatively unknown to the majority of the film going population you were on inside Edge which was streaming on Amazon what's the time of television bajirao and abhimanyu people knew of you the paparazzi had sort of taken you were on the radar of the paparazzi no one had an idea what to expect but a year of course in 2019 every single one of you broke out because you were in films that were very good of films that were very successful what films did everyone is talking about as they are of you so first of all congratulations what's new did you have a plan b do you have a plan b in case the acting gig didn't work cereal entrepreneur 16 and I became independent from my family that age and focused on that for a couple of years still I found once many people don't know raman raghav and when I was the other the 2017 episode singing on stage to I I will say Mere paas koi option when when I started I started as a background dancer or wa it is something I did enjoy to do when I was younger but I always thought I'd sing and I actually didn't think I'd be in India much longer after I'm so sweet I was 16 oh my god that is a long time ago 16 was long time now do I have a plan b pottery I can be cancel all of them appeal to me so I know I live my life happily and peacefully wherever I am whatever I am doing but because acting is I just opened my eyes carefully to all the signs that the cosmos of the Universe or the PA was giving me and I was like okay I I take it I take it you I take all of you don't see you doing anything else in the sense because my father was a theatre performer back Haryana he did his fair bit of efforts to start a theatre festival and things like that there's no archive I started off with my option my plan B actually you're supposed to bring my charger account and see my final was due and you know I was also like is there one film or that triggered your love for the movies perhaps growing up you know watch the film watch the performance I was a big fan of an obsessed with Bollywood and Karina part of a dharma film was such a big deal because I've grown up darkness with the fight action that's how it was like weekend weekend all my childhood dream I don't know I had no clue as a child to give he would make sure I got a lot of story book films after 12th standard and I was learning classical music so all those things so I ended up having so when I had just passed 12th and I laptop and I open it up and the first thing that I saw was Pursuit of Happiness then I saw these things allow you to express things that can't other most people know that Environmental have wrote everything that she did and I think that you know what it's the time in the movies now I feel like so many amazing women are around he's the one who sort of teaches them how to get into Rap Battles he really inspires him he pushes him you've said that in reality on set the dynamic was exactly the opposite because Ranveer was your mentor Ranveer Eminem and Lil Wayne he goes method I'm feeling was we are not making a film is a movement so we are a part of this movement and we all have to represent something or the other was there a similar sort of dynamic because in Sony your her boss your superior and there is that so and and in charge of making sure she doesn't lose it but there's also great empathy what was what was that dynamic like we all hi hi I'm thinking how can I help I am playing Sony and you you actually audition for Sony that was like one of my best experiences with her and that's how we actually built a relationship because that really really helped don't the it becomes bigger and everyone becomes a part for for some moments I was intimidated when I saw her because there's this girl you can Google her name and workshops which talked about when is the exchange insurance intensive workshops that we are building a very strong relationship and that is very necessary for no those moments that they took I really I really enjoyed that go through all those emotions as a sister as a I would really feel that love when you have the kind of cloud the kind of influence that some of you have on social media I know that every single one of you is on Instagram yours is a closed account when you have that kind of following when you have that kind of attention how do you stay grounded it's this is everyone loves me everyone listen to what I am I have to say everyone wants to see what I want what I'm wearing today how do you are you able to I mean are you able to kind of sift through that and and sort of realise that this is a digital he kind of went through a difficult I think it's just really important I think a are support systems are so important in this you know we with every week that goes by I think with the pap with the media with digital The Importance that were given to to the Digital platform I think so our families and our friends 3 and 7 million range but on my way you have a lot of feedback you have you know that people who love certain things about you and obviously you can't take it to your head but you aware of things which are going around you you're not like this is what I am because I don't want to create an echo chamber right around me I just I need to what's happening what my fans are where are they from what's the age group and you know what do they like about me what do they don't like about me you don't present a version of yourself I mean on the one hand everyone is saying social media is about being authentic and being your true self but it's also about do you know posting who you're wearing what you're wearing you know literally have a picture for every occasion that needs to be sent out it's also about of your social media presence I noticed that some of you don't post very regularly as as perhaps some of the other is there a lot of pressure from the managers from the agents definitely but we have to remember that the power is not how much we are influenced by them it's how much we can Influence People I'm speaking individually but I'm guessing that all of your also pretty much follow the same thing it's very important that we extremely important in this I just look for my when the Toronto Film Festival 100 calls today where is I think a lot of effort goes into being so much at peace if you are yourself out there you're honest but you lose yourself but you know if you want to project a thing you're not going to be honest but you're projecting like in the olden days if there was a holding you could you would get say 10000 eyeballs a day kind of gets to me still not been able to get out to social media can you play undermined what is that like again just as you're able to not take the praise and the Numbers play seriously are you also able to not let the the bullying get to you see me on kind and I started so positive solely just because people should just learn that it's cool to be kind and it's good to be just positive and nice 69 is sitting at home watching us live turn on the command section and I try and reply empathetically to where they are coming from if seeing if someone has time to come onto my profile consume my content and hit on it I'm sorry something you're not getting enough love in your life show all their fans are like constantly abuse nepotism got an your respective parents who consistently have did they can you for the fickleness for the fickle nature of this business I mean you're going to get the foot in the door but it's a fickle business did they prepare you for that did your mum prepare she tried to take me Instagram it's not hashtag good looking girls it's not hashtag shorts sleeping yourself I mean crying yourself to sleep night after night when you don't get things when you're told a certain way when you're I'm 29 my films come out this year I've been in this industry for 10 years when I go to an interview people don't know my name they say I've been now abhimanyu but then they asked 30 years ago which you will still like I don't even get free passes to an a when we did the international circular 15 film festivals sold out standing oceans everywhere no one captured it I we need to move away from that because okay negatively cells but it's a short term cell what's the story in the award winning I wouldn't want it any other way you know people hate on me for nepotism so hard indispensable in my Dad go through so many things that I don't take anything too serious and I think I overcompensate sometimes you know I'm so scared that people are going to say I've always wanted to be an actor am I put it on someone who's getting the money back to me or someone who I know for 3 years it is not now it happened even 100 years ago if you wanted to be a blacksmith you go live with the blacksmith 4% where's my magazine cover looks where's my fashion show difficult for someone who is a stars kid or daughter to become a superstar because people are already expecting so you said that you model your character in Sony on the body language of a puma and and told you that you're videos to understand the body language I want to talk to all of you about the importance of body language for for a character does you know agility how important is that what is the I mean do you do you specifically turn on body language of a character I think body language is so important I come from a theatre background again and 75% of communication or more than that is body language so someone will understand the person that you are kalpana wouldn't have been kalpana if it wasn't also for the body language along with everything else and when we were having shops I remember walking in the corridors of a hotel for hours together because I have this little ankle thing it was really a constant effort for me before every action to remind myself OK keep your feet straight saloni batra you need to keep your feet straight and bent with experience in this and that so Through the Keyhole the body language well Ranveer and then there is the way you said you walk so is where was like okay share share share share workshop first what's the difference all the time but lions only chameleon cricket body language 4 5 mahine duck character ke costume character key costume what genuine body plus body language ke literally first day kitna pressure Wala fortunately unfortunately mud didn't have a producer for a long time after the film was ready to go and floors and I'm getting delayed we didn't have to do sourceful next month started next month started the next one starter for 9 months and that's where what's the opportunity to work on The Voice and because I change my voice for the film and the body language cuz I'm a man child and Surya he was a trained martial artist but he wouldn't be scared if something was hitting him because he doesn't feel it together play body language of being erect at the same time but banging into things yeah play Blacklisted so much at home last 3 months I went into isolation where I didn't speak to anyone because Surya doesn't speak to anyone except his language it won't be the annunciation of words that would be just speaking thoughts randomly and at this time like my mom was really upset because she would be like so Khan Academy sing and in 3 months what was also Surya didn't have any insecurities which all of us because of the because we all get jaded throughout our lives and I had to visit all my insecurities and that was so powerful and an enlightening at the same time it was amazing because I came out such a stronger my girlfriend at the time broke how has each of your life changed since your movies came out in some of you have had either personally either an internal way how have you changed personally or externally how perceptions around you change what's the most significant change that you notice since you became an actress since you became a film actor because some of you have been lost my relatives my family now they want to come and just that's something yeah that's something which has changed even my friends my school friends when I meet them they just want to talk about what's happening as if I have to go see the industry and I don't talk about I want to talk about my school days I want to talk about how I was and how journey was still here but they don't talk about that they want to just you know but you also have a very close what is working so I think I'm not perfect at all and I don't want to be and I want to get better and when people see me in interviews and then they like me then when I meet them one factual observation about current times is people do not listen to economists or historians they listen to today and I hope we don't get disappointed more times improve I hope you're kind of towards each other I don't a lot of other Festival volume and then when finding the film came to mommy is when people from the industry actually started watching it and that I would kind of mark as when life actually started changing in terms of career casting directors directors producers blah blah blah Oscar winning directors and producers and actors from all around the world and we had a batches on you know all these names some trying to not change anything from doing just keep doing what I'm doing not for responsibility or jyada Hai look what was the expected brought about a very positive change in my personality because I went to so switch off the Sony not that anyone was giving pressure I was just taking it for no reason I was taking so much pressure that I was like listen if I keep I need to chill I need to relax and because I face so much pressure now I've become a way more positive person than I ever was like I really really believe that just keep doing your best and everything will follow seriously to every little thing that that one is doing is definitely something very new for me and for my family luckily have a twin sister who is turn on Sims plus and has no idea about anything to do with the line of work that I'm a part of which is fantastic to go back home too because she refuses to make me I think therefore I don't think there's any pressure or taking anything to to seriously because the minute I'm back home I'm exactly the way that that I was growing up play new life you know do you remember the one meeting with with someone perhaps are the one we are shaktimaan Mukesh Khanna what what just happened I couldn't talk to him I couldn't first time on the set of the not necessarily actors but as people in this industry the coolest guy in the industry like hands down and then I just want to know such a lovely gentleman I did so I try and keep in touch with them and they kind of moulded my decision into becoming an actor so somewhere it's them influencing me to become an actor I think it was a meeting Vishal bhardwaj like him coming and me trying like I was some he was there I got pulled towards him he said really really good things and I just look at him then his wife play friends on set a confidence like noun key body language MAKEUP WITH kaun Hai Naam ki language mein na unke darwaza khol rahoon sorry Google starstruck exactly but I do remember feeling great respect and admiration when I was working on Aladdin for Mr Guy instantly connected to he is someone whose work is fantastic how about him and it's so charming for anyone that's you know so established and well-known respected of amazing things and and still the innocence and that appreciative of of these opportunities and the gifts that are coming your way I feel like the future is teeth in your hands thank you so much thank you for the wonderful performance thank you thank you thank you
