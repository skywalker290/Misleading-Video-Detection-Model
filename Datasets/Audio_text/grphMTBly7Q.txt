Supergirl bad who funds these shows why are they singing so much money into these TV shows that I don't understand anyone would watch I don't even know this show existed apparently it's been running for almost 5 years and they went from do you wish to now going on 1 million viewers let's go through some of my favorite scene from this is called the worst CGI in TV series so prepare yourself and the best part about this clip is that they use this the promo this is what they want to show what Supergirl looks like to people that haven't really watched Supergirl prepare yourself is happening one person does one thing and then there's another thing and then switch it to another thing and Supergirl was actually construction why not stand up it's so good let's watch it on slow speed oh God what a hot mess that's why it's like that really feminist empowering moment in Lord of the Rings when she's like I am the man so super speed punch what is happening here are they supposed to walk through glass something they look like crystal meth or something look at that yeah they are they walking through the WoW this guy says we came prepared immediately get shot can you take prepared I don't have a good clearly that's been some budget cuts going on here and I understand this is just one scene probably have better CGI this looks like some PlayStation 2 level of CDI honestly it looks so bad what's really conf cuz I kept trying to find like all right are there any more like bad CGI but they actually have like a ton of these when they break down the I'm not I'm not thinking of just like blindly hate something that would be foolish I wouldn't do that but yeah Supergirl sucks it sucks it really sucks as you play these numbers like this don't take my word for it just take this drop out all right so here's the curse video that I love so much superheroes without special effects look super silly all right here we go we're not going to win this today dang it better fly away oh wait what she doesn't by the way are you serious she doesn't actually have super powers this is crazy what is your superpower this is hands in really fast you don't want to mess with me boy they are really Pros if I was there I'd be laughing stop right props to them honestly I could not do that no way I seriously defects I mean now I kind of respect the CGI team for making those goofy ass scenes look actually cool so great I love it so much doesn't look like silly with the fact I think it does it's still kind of silly damn this makes me realize how much you real life sucks yes thank you Supergirl for nothing now the reason that my attention was caught peaked by whatever since I have to say you explain what I'm trying to say a recently they did another promo I guess because their viewers are so high that they just somebody need more again this is the showing what's cool about the show this is to get more people involved what is the budget I want to know how much they're little toy figures what is that that's so cool is this stream available in this location asking for a fan of wait there's an actual Supergirl fandom even do you have given up hope that we must be really bad then I kind of want to watch Supergirl now I'm not going to lie that seems to make a little Hope Island it looks like they're fighting Bionicles what is this is not that's right actor from Supergirl just yelled Leroy Jenkins on ironically in 2020 it might be time to cancel the show guys I'm sorry I mean I appreciate it I'm not going to lie that makes me laugh the fact that they did that but it's also very cringe you can't do that you can't just do that apparently people are actually watching the show why why why why why why why it's like you can do anything else why are you watching this you can do anything I was trying to understand people don't like site is Supergirl cyber girl whatever apparently Supergirl has been like sneaking in social justice propaganda what and fans aren't happy about it so I obviously I need to investigate what is it play some sad about this we have this clip here the characters basically me when you really want to say no that big but you have to go a lot so weird send message really why so he's not just cuz he's alien he's not allowed to be on the planet that's not cool man no because she will actually die why why so you're saying is she the woman is that why woman strong men short little women have to have short or tiny penis that's all they have nothing else I hate that but thinking with it do you think that's how the I know this is a minor detail but clearly like her suit is making her look more buff it could be kind of cool to get like an actual really strong woman like that Korean chick from that video that I reviewed that I had to edit out say I'm not against a superhero woman that empowers women I'm not against it I know that's going to sound like a lie but I'm not against it thanks Supergirl get a new team of CGI isn't it we can meet at all it might have no jammed or something cuz that's no way that would happen period one time when we can't do that I'm a horrible terrible person that pretty much summed it up right there guy bad girl good well Supergirl rating bad why don't you throw in another reference how about Chocolate Rain reference in the next episode I'm pretty sure I can help out the writers I know all the memes how about this super tall man it's like the mega chat of all time he's like 12 ft tall and then you you forgot to go like this and then she says me gusta that was for that was for free smash like if you enjoyed
