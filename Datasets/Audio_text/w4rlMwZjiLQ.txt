hit the film journalist jackpot like three interviews and 4 months about let me ask the questions that you may ask so I don't have to answer them again so if you're going to ask me is there a concerted effort that you're moving towards a different Cinema seeing the choices of your last three films dear Zindagi rice and fan know it's coincidental so different kind of rules which are character-driven and stuff like that no I think the how do you see with the Advent of these actors shifting over to Hollywood do you have any plans to do the same and do you think Indian Cinema can go pause and make it smart like because of these two young ladies who done it and the fourth one is erase your back to when is buy designs from morally tricky because there's a bad guy doing bad things but he's making it so sexy that we're all rooting for him very play the box office people really appreciated them and I was in them I said yes to them and then I realized that I am playing a real life based character who may not be the person and I told this to the director that there is play I will not make him like him and I just feel that person should not be like I think you know it's not something that I add sell to the people that is okay being him or a film is being made about him or a couple of other people and I should glorify so I left the extremely good guy and the extremely bad guy both have something in common that is you have to be possessed and obsessive to be really a data and you have to be possessed and obsessive to be really at the when we became very clear that this is now a study of bootlegging in a period from 85 to 95 people doing it it's not real it's not real having said that play a realistic world I think some of the pieces that have been you know when they're done research the method of bypassing law and his competitors are very interesting and real intriguing at least to me because maybe I'm too Urban but he's fictional I mean there is no person that you can turn around and say and then I think Raul and we have been very clear that if he does something wrong there how many payment for it it has to be retribution for it by law or otherwise so in our hearts we are clear that you know you're not glorifying but you can always find moments of goodness Humanity in the good one or the bad one you know I mean how good is a guy and even if the father of the girls had been mean what it does resistance of these people and in today's time and age even more why you glorifying bad things and yeah I've told by my actresses friends just play the good guy enough you're a nice person why do you do all this I enjoyed it as an actor to be honest and I have no problem saying that you said in an interview with GQ magazine that you that the film was more realistic and more hitting and you actually turned it down so it was turn down because you were playing this man know it was turned down at the onset only because when Rahul had written it and when we were reading it of course I do in moments of weakness but I can't do it anymore I swear I mean how do I use movies name on screen I can't say that I find it I'm sorry put the comedy connotation was for a lady for me it was becoming an abuse to a woman so I remember you asked if you were going 910x and I'm like this morning I have problems swearing on screen getting married after watching my phone I meet a lot of couples who say we to his girl on the cover of your book and because she likes me and him so I think people can get certain kind of things that touch them or turn them around and make them think differently maybe the film can bring about a change in people who can then go ahead and make the changes play the film kind of propagated or talked about but as a whole it's like a book you know it's not like you read this book in the world is going to give me another somebody famous and the movies are for entertainment postal services are for messages The Hollywood Reporter break up because he felt like he had hit a ceiling with his talent and he said I spent 2 years just working on myself because your work can never be better or deeper than who you are have you ever had a moment of that like feeling like you had I'm just going through the motions because you don't need to do any more than that I have enough graph to know that I need to just move away from here for a bit I'm quieter at the end of the show I watch better movies I read better books and then play go and sign up in my phone you know I wait for that to happen to me having said that Mr Sunil gavaskar once during a match send the only way to get back from or the lack of interest in trying to get light is to get the bad balls out of the system you just keep batting just keep batting get the bad balls out of the system and then you'll start hitting instead of I just like to go and you know play as many balls of the bad balls are out that feeling is out of your system just get how much can I expose of the real me in a character you know that is the struggle you know when you're new and you'll notice this with new I was I it volume up but can I have the guts to be myself now in scenes like there are moments in fan like when unifying a part of me that what would happen to me if this happened to me and yeah this would happen to my ears well getting all hot what does guy find me a late and stuff like that again awkward because I am in the movie star Space by profession I have been late maybe I have not been subjected to puzzle painting I want to start painting like a child I thought it was a nice line to say you know but I understand that now more so and time off and just stopped wanting to ask then be scary for me controlled megalomania and you know when to use it and you know when to let go of it is is that true do you guys have a controlled megalomania I would not be able to come until Monday be a little more you can when did the gobble being a little more sensitive than the others or yeah I mean you know you say something to me and I'm not get back to you but it's hurt my feelings enormous circumstances you know or somebody doesn't understand that I'm I always say time starts when I need some place and now that is quieter megalomaniac look like it is very angry and you know it is but you know yourself aware enough to let it go when comes from trying to cover that any boy who wants to date sahana you said get a job so this is your list for that person get a job she's my princess this is my favorite I don't mind going back to jail tell me again saying this I will never be able to ask my daughter is a decent does he treat you well I'm too shy to hoping the Macho father thing will scare you like you know my dad has big mustache and he carries a gun you know like I was play I was told by my brother-in-law ones that you know Mirage your mama and if what did you learn from that experience and he said we learned that you don't go up against Shahrukh Khan no matter how good your product is today are you destroy Clash competitive in my head but I have said this to you I think maybe who win the race I make my phone with a lot of confidence that's why I do the thing that I'm doing so competitive eyes yes play me some jokes you know that I'm not really playing the lead please don't put the pressure on this wonderful beautiful from the gallery and Aaliyah have made you know so I don't know how to when you want to start it does become a huge responsibility so the Competitive Edge is still there but in terms of delivering that responsibility I'm not going to turn around and say I do it for this you know it's not me it's for the others I'm not I'm not a genuinely honestly feel extremely sad that I like Manish Sharma and it's got nothing to do with one can turn around and say the I think I did my job to the best of my capability I'm not questioning or feeling guilty but I know Manish Sharma deserved better platform talk with me and I'm not taking away from what he's done before but I just feel saddened by that I told you that last night it's not destruction of who I didn't make so much or I did it's just like he needed and even if you did not work with me after that megalomaniacal movie star the guy who unfortunately has been chosen to be the leader I wish a unaffiliated job that I have to bear the responsibility of you got to look after everyone I'm the least but at the end of it all without perhaps wanting to be so it's difficult being the shuffle my feelings you know I just need to move away I don't even watch my feelings now the Complete product I'm like let me just move away because do whatever I can do to the best of my capability be myself as an actor so it does get you know some some friends are there I feel I want to do the competition is to make sure that 3DS games what they set out to game in a nice way from the film that I'm part of well good luck what is a third interview
