and it's impossible to ignore why are so many companies copying airpods so about 4 years ago and 2016 Apple got on stage and announced the iPhone 7 to the world which first iPhone ever with courageously no headphone jack and during that same presentation on the same stage 27 minutes later Danville their newest creation airpods prepare completely wireless headphones one earbud in each ear in this convenient magnetic case if they want to get to their vision of this Totally Wireless future where we don't need cables or Chords Anymore they had to get rid of the headphone jack and eventually all the other rest of the what's like the lightning Port 2 in theory so this is the first Brave courageous step towards that future but it really comes Courage the courage to move on do something new that better is all of us but they also actually what is conveniently rediscovered was that selling people the solution to a problem that you just created a half an hour earlier was a brilliant play to make a ton of money on top of already making a ton of money like it's no secret that Apple makes most of its profit from the iPhone and things connected to the iPhone we've talked about the ecosystem before they're smart they've made services like iCloud Drive Apple pay Apple pair all these things that capitalized on the massive customer base that is the iPhone to make significantly more money from it it's a smart business so this is play concept for Apple we're just now adding dongles and wireless headphones to that list but of course it doesn't all work unless it's at least a good product and it was people love airpods they are definitely not the first wireless earbuds ever but the combination of play convenience and the little case they came in and putting them right next to the iPhone and of course how well they worked with it instant pairing that whole thing made an instant hit and of course they were the number one selling headphones in the world a year later and so now today it's estimated that with airpods 2 now airpods Pro and the wireless charger and with the tens of millions of sales Apple has made around $8 billion dollars from airpods 8 billion dollars that might not sound like a huge percentage of Apple that's because it's not but just for some perspective if you broke that off into a separate company and Incorporated a new headphone company God's Inc separate from Apple that company is revenues by itself would be enough to be a Fortune 500 company and probably I'm in the middle of the pack more than the bottom two or 300 of those and plus they're expected to jump up again in 2020 as iPhone 5s and six owners continue to upgrade and the headphone jack continues to disappear so that was airpod sales are taking off and going to orbit a lot of money is that were ridiculing Apple for getting rid of the headphone jack along with you and me will they took a look at this again and saw that they kind of put a piece of that pie like this would be a silly business decision not to get involved in this huge New Market that's basically being created in front of their eyes so they do the same thing Google will they made a commercial calling out the headphone jack a year after Apple got rid of theirs then literally the next pixel that came out had no headphone jack and hey what do you know Google pixel buds now exists one plus has been they made their remarks but two years after Apple their new OnePlus 6t had no headphone jack and their new wireless bullets headphones appeared as a convenient solution Huawei flagships don't have headphone Jacks anymore either but they'll gladly sell you their new play freebuds to set you free of wires razors phones also don't have headphone Jacks but you'll see their new Hammerheads wireless earbuds Echo buds Microsoft has announced their surface buds even the essential phone from a company that popped up on the map for 1 year and made one phone with no headphone jack also happened to make attachable HD headphone jack adapter that is still listed on their site to this day actually has nothing to do with airpod clones that's just but even Samsung has been one of the last major holdouts with a headphone jack in the Galaxy es but sure enough they got rid of that headphone jack on the play Note 10 and the s20 I'm afraid to say it but that's next and they've been pushing Galaxy buds that conveniently charge right on the back of the phone that have slightly different form factors and feature sets to differentiate them but they all quickly do the same thing which is solve a problem that was just created the headphone jack as quickly disappearing it's becoming like an yes feature and you see headlines about when a new headphone jack is included in a phone because it's sort of a noteworthy thing to see that again and of course I see pretty much every major headphone company in the world scrambling to make their best wireless earbuds to also compete here so Audio Technica pair Sony makes a pair I just got back from CVS where I saw TCL is making a pair this is it's got the connection button on the back and flips open like that and there's magnets that hold the earbuds in like this is their airpods competitor even these companies that don't have a smartphone to connect it to are just trying to sell you something that you've reasonably consider buying over airpods for some reason because this is a pie they got to get in on and then top of all that does the whole world of airpods clones and if you're thinking no no wait a minute these aren't clones they're all you know they have their I'm talking about the ones that literally try to make themselves look exactly like airpods in an effort to basically ask you that you're getting the same thing for less money these are the ones that are not so well-intentioned you might have seen these black airpods floating around or some variant of them or if you just Google airpods clone there's a whole world of tws i500s being sold ships from various online retailers and there are even companies out there right now you might have already seen the singer feed that are using stolen footage from my airpods Pro review and using them in Instagram ads to try to convince you to buy their fake drop shipped add clones it's everywhere so the bottom line is everyone pretty much everyone capable of making headphones in some way is making small pocketable completely wireless earbuds that seal up in a case and connect to your phone so this has some what does and cons of course we all know the downsides which are if you want to listen to music through wired headphones you need to carry a dongle everywhere and often the quality is but also wireless audio is just not great yet it's getting there but if you've ever tried edit a video or music with wireless headphones you know how bad the latency and the lag can get and you know what we're talking about it's just not quite there yet but because of all that the upside is the same thing that created the downside which is that now everyone is trying to make the best possible wireless audio solution the best possible wireless headphones to try to beat airpods and we see this in the forms of all different types of features list wireless charging on phones the razor Hammerheads focusing on minimizing latency Sony's wf-1000xm 3 doing Act please cancellation better than any other earbud I've ever heard and they pretty much all feature an assistant now too there's Siri and are which means there's Google Assistant hustle Buds and many others Bixby in Galaxy Buds and Cortana in surface buds in theory anyway when those come out it means everyone's working what's a better World of Wireless so that maybe this Wireless future we've dreamed of isn't so power off after all now I have no excuse for that like Shameless blatant airpods rip-offs like these are just clearly trying to make a buck shamelessly trying to take advantage of people looking for a deal but the truth really is airpods are apples most impactful and successful product the original iPhone and who wouldn't want to copy that thanks for watching catch you guys the next one piece
