YouTube oopsie poopsie Pure News good evening I'm poppy Florian lead anchor of pioneers the most esteemed new source of all time our first from YouTube to do a better job preventing harassment on YouTube it's a big X here we consulted with a wide array of Creator style experts and organizations to update the official blog let's go through it doesn't matter the thing that I've learned about YouTube policies is that it doesn't matter what they say matters is how they enforce it and we've already seen how it's done they may they change this harassment policy their first move their first you're a business apparently was to remove items leafy content cup that was it thank God the policy so they can get rid of this video finally what if you read the blog post it says Beyond play someone there is also demeaning language that goes too far too far I dubs too far when idub said small too far it's so stupid apparently I allegedly leave her himself has message is complete bogus his whole Channel leave himself is made of criticizing other channels come back leafy come back I miss you we need you diet we're in dire need over here first of all why retroactively take down videos if you're going to make a new policy change then go from there don't go back in an old videos to say actually this one this one bad what is that fix reading more in this blog post it's clear that they made this as a resp let's see what happened earlier this year between Steven Crowder and that box guy and Crowder was poking fun of his homosexual mannerisms which I will not replicate because whenever I think about it I just can't believe anyone would do that I'm joking of course we'll get more into that harassment hurts our community by making people less inclined to share their opinion and engage with each other we heard from time and time again from creators this does the opposite YouTube creators are freaking degenerates they're the worst people speaking from a YouTuber we pull the worst imaginable just to get views on this side that's how get paid thus far yes I used that word the only thing keeping these YouTube vultures in check or other we have this Anarchy system okay and don't come and ruin it for us YouTube the rule is if you do dumb shit YouTube you will get called out on it we need that it's the only thing keeping us saying YouTube don't take it away from us a couple of examples and this is just a handful daddyofive making videos abusing children his own kids YouTube that took the first step in action to make sure something happened no no it was all the YouTubers guess they can just flag them down for bullying now the same tactics is used I'm not going to name degenerate Creator is getting criticized by other YouTubers the play the tactic he uses to strike it down is to copy strike those videos so he gets the money from those creators now you're just giving more close to these scumbags to strike down criticism Logan Paul showed a video with that a fucking dead body a Corp it wasn't rude by YouTube no no no no no no no no no no no no no it was removed by Logan after other people criticized him promoting Gam talk to kids did YouTube do anything about that no no it was other creators that noticed it and called it out making videos people's recently passing are you two going to add a policy for that cuz previously it's YouTubers telling people to not do thanks and otherwise they would get away with it if YouTube know what's good at them they'll keep their fucking hands out of this well-developed 100% flawed system where you dumb you get called out that's just how it is I don't dumb shit too I get called out it's it's not epic actually but it's good it's good for everyone further on they say we've always removed videos that explicitly threaten someone reveal Prudential information and encourage people to have someone moving forward our policy will go and accept further and not only play explicit threats but also implied threats we don't want to be dumb free enough so we're going to jump through some I think it's really good because YouTube 100% knows the intent of the video called I'm glad they censored the thumbnail because it was just completely horrible it's called the death of a383 it was a video amazing H3 whatever your opinion on the video is it got removed and I think it was because he was holding a gun towards 8383 in thumbnail I think I think that's how I remember it do you think a tree is is scared for his maybe because of that that video needed to be gone I mean everyone knew as she is she was in big trouble because nobody's personal safety thanks to that I mean my God what do we have done no one thinks he's going to shoot 833 just cuz he hold up a gun no one is fearing for 50 why are you doing that why is there no distinction between intent and actual action it's not that hard to tell between the part in English so I asked you to about this cuz I was kind of worried where they're going to draw the distinction and they said that Max will fall under artistic content and scripted comedy and stand up is fine but you can't abuse the artistic content an excuse to keep harassing someone a lot of people raised the question I've seen other YouTubers being like okay so why can't late night show hosts you know make fun of Donald Trump as an example because they're pretty Relentless with it to a point where it just stopped being funny years ago but play it's an American Media rule this is just what I've heard that says that you can ridicule public figures that's fine thank thank God public figures are still up to ridicule aren't we all public figures on YouTube isn't that the point like this doesn't sense to me why do they get a pass and some don't it seems very selective if someone understands explain to me I don't understand this it should be the same and to summarize this I think it seems the same case for a lot of YouTube's update where the intention is good don't think people should get a tax for their sexual identity or but it's always like this is what we want to strike down and then all these other things and consequences is the result of it and I don't understand how that happens every time it's like Papa wasn't enough there's no kids content on YouTube and there's no edgy content anymore on YouTube but what we have here encapsulated it's very nice very delicious stale content taste so stale Liza koshy I don't have time to record this but I wanted to make an update on the whole copper situation that I covered last week for those of you don't know if it's made for kids or if it isn't and there's a lot of confusion based on what his family friendly what is made for kids and it's still pretty unclear but hopefully we'll get more updates question mark where the distinction is we saw already that a lot of channels were flagged as for kids when they clearly were not and I got really upset about it because I think when you could lose up to 90% of your Revenue but according to what I've heard it's closer to 60% okay it still sucks but that the main issue I'm making this update is because it's not like a branding Maiden I don't know Aaron fork or something you can still remove it it doesn't matter what matters is that you make your own distinction if your content is made for kids or not Define that is quoted 42,000 from the FTC if you make an issue is only if you're a big YouTuber and I'm the one that's going to get can I find if you're smaller YouTuber and you happen to get fined which seems unlikely cuz they're not just going to go over after the bigger ones first anyway so it's still very frustrating and it's still very annoying but it's not as panic mode as it seems at least that's what I the most searched people and celebrities was revealed by PornHub we have Philadelphia in the Kim K cardi B Linda play Ariana Grande PewDiePie on Valentine's Day what is wrong with you 5000% increase remote PP you can now vote
