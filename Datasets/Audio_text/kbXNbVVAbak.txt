hey please subscribe to filmfare and do watch yourself. what is my experience my experience was wonderful I got to learn so much and. Alexa happy and lucky to have her because she's so good. play making his love because you don't know how energy is going to match really and we're not tested or done anything together or whatever. when we were on set it was amazing because she just you know it was perfect for the part and came alive and the energy is look great the energy. anything directing were amazing I don't think generation makes a difference either a decent actor or not and. luckily everyone in this film is very good so the material shines. where are all equals on the set so we're not really in a position to teach or learn because there's just a standard of either good. I'm glad everything went off. play hard questions. are you a son mom like that. play piano music. I didn't even realize I didn't make the connection at all until I was sitting with I was like oh yeah that's so funny because. play Julio Jones music oh yeah I really like it's very stupid but I really didn't realize it I think. bundle I love it I love that I'm on the bottom side by side looking up my skirt I don't know who thinks of this. next day or later minutes later
