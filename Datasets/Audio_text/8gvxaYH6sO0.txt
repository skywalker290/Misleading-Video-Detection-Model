go when she win the war I don't deserve this guys look I'm not that attractive why are you riding LML huh what's for these laughing emojis what's so freaking funny huh am I the only how dare you how

unbelievable see this makes my blood boil he should have been number one you should have been number one God damn it play KPOP Stan's number two baby two we went from 181 to say thanks everyone who voted for me I really appreciate it thank you next news so basically the way I find out about all this was that I was okay because I need a picture of myself for them now I don't I'm not the loser I swear I don't Google myself what is this now media portrays PewDiePie as a loser to sell his success story says there's so many articles coming out lately I'm just like I can't keep up with this I mean that goes for anyone I thought it was so obvious when I said that it's like when you started this is complete sidetracked by the way just happened to see this it's cuz I did the Q&A video and a lot of people a lot of responses to that or just echoing what I said he said this in shorts PewDiePie thinks media portrayed try to portray him as a loser so that is I was kind of a loser but not just like epic loser I was in between loser okay there is a there is such a thing don't even try to pretend it isn't so another thing I mentioned in my past video was that media always under it's me after all the controversies before it was like PewDiePie make 200 billion and now it's like oh PewDiePie made less than I don't know some you're too bad I'm like I'm pretty sure like I don't know their personal business or whatever but I'm pretty sure okay 14 million views okay play million views I mean 4 billion sorry but then the sun was like okay all right well then we overvalue at you then 54 I'm in 2019 apparently I made 54 million guys it's just so crazy it's always like I get the people want to know add number so people are just going to make up a bunch of stuff but this thing doesn't make any sense it says January I made 5.8 mil and then it says in December I made 2.9 it should be the opposite because December is usually at least almost three or four times more than January but here they evaluate January almost twice as much as the same like that makes no sense and what's brofist logo what does that mean I'm so confused so this study was based this is based on a study this research play Tear it Up by Online Marketplace on buy.com what is that they just link to the website I try to find the study I cannot find it I'm Poppy smoria and I do research I'm so confused nothing even shows up when I search PE but my favorite part of this article is a little fun fact window PewDiePie Scandal you know in case you forgot just in case you forgot we have to mention this what's up we made it a bullet point list just so it's easier for you to in case you forgot and case anyone's forgotten it seems to me that a lot of times how many people bring up bad things I've done then fans wants to respond to me like well actually you know he's done a lot of positive things like look he's done charity and then the response just because you did Charity doesn't mean it absorbs all your bad behavior but it's like well the point is just I said if you're constantly bringing up all the negative over and over and over then yeah you're going to paint a bad picture that's the whole point people aren't that's not the point of everybody why you're only allowed to make one side of the argument you would never see who plays charity Deeds or whatever like a list of randomly in an article that's just not happening that's my point I'm not saying what I did was okay evaluating me I appreciate that I think that's fair I there we go they kept going how they keep going all right I take it back I take back my thank you I also like the headline from the Sun before quitting YouTube I'm not quitting YouTube how hard is it to understand I'm not quitting Jesus next news this is PE am I related punished why are there so many articles I don't understand it shows up on the front page here Swedish YouTuber PewDiePie describes fans Malaysia in Singapore as hectic and screaming did you guys know about this I said there's a week ago and it's posting now I'm so confused reset your thinking today about the news a week ago that isn't really news I want to bring this up mainly just to clarify what I said in the what's that I was comparing fan culture from different going in the more Asian region compared to a small open countries you know it's very very different so that make me think that that's a train Behavior the reason I was so annoyed in Malaysia was because overly answering our hotel and it felt like we couldn't leave our hotel because people were just looking for us and it felt like we were being but I will say you know I was being a bit dishonest when I spoke about Singapore because actually the first I got recognized in Singapore that was like a huge thing for me because I'm never been recognized as a celebrity before quotation I don't know if you have footage of that but it was absolute Madness it's something that I've learned that I personally don't enjoy but I would be sing if I said you know I hated it the first time it happened especially back then as well because YouTube wasn't really a thing back then it wasn't recognized by the media or anyone so to see the effect that had on fans was kind of it was kind of cool to see you know I just wanted to point that I'm sorry if I was a little harsh to you Singapore and Malaysia it's not your fault okay like that was fun I'm not going to lie just all right sorry sorry I'm sorry next news all right this is one of my favorite things so good so there's this new meme called new okay that Trends I read this as well when I Googled myself new guy meme Trends following controversial PewDiePie comic I'm just like how does that play to me I am so confused so basically what happened was only NG pointed out that he saw someone else who made this web and it goes like this I won't show the artist because it's it's besides the point but basically it's saying hey oh what's so funny new guy that millionaire gamer bro douchebag totally got robbed hey hey hey hey how do you like it if you were robbed new guy says oh wow I can tell we're going to be the kind of co-workers who become good friends wow hell no hell no the thing is like so this is the person that made the webcomic in this person is trying to vilify a new guy but that person is so tone deaf they didn't understand that they make what's the word for it it's so unself-aware this is the first thing I saw today and people started new guy later that night if only you we could be so much more than friends so good so great it must have hella got from Hey Arnold if you guys saw that add comic new guy empathetic caring places himself in the shoes of his fellow man questions sociopathic it's happy when he he thought he made a friend even one lacking empathy he has all landmarks of a good protagonist if you were you'd make a good friend I want to be friends with new guy he seems great he's not judging so they already is also made this comic where she interprets this blonde girl saying that she has a girlfriend but in reality she just meant that she has a friend that's a girl and then she follows up with saying well sorry but that is infinitely less interesting to me okay great so let's look at that I don't use Twitter anymore how did it work hashtag new guy I just love how to spawn this new guy how can you not love him he's so cute I love how they try to make him as a bad person and it's just like and I love Lisa probably a real human interaction that happened over someone celebrating me getting my house robbed people who are hurt hurt people ever since realizing that I swore I would never hurt anyone the pain ends with me I really what this message cuz I don't know anything about this person who wrote this webcomic and and I really highly don't want anyone to seek which person or anything like that I think it's more the point here is that to react in a way that is so I don't want to boohoo me or whatever I'm looking at this outside of my own context but the fact that you know people who react in this way about something unjust happening to to me is you know it's not normal that I feel like it's not normal behavior to react this way I think how many times when people project anger on the Internet or in towards other people it sounds like they're probably dealing with something and they're just lashing out on other things which is not new it's always going to happen you know I sound like that guy were really haters hate them you know but there's a clear distinction to me wishing actual hormones someone or something illegal to what happened to someone as a way to celebrate it even if you don't like him it's not normal to want that to happen to someone genuinely like haha that's the weird part of me and and and and and how that line is blurred because I'm a millionaire apparently when it's not about the money it's about the personal face and it's weird have no one understands that and that's what new guy is saying it's like well you wouldn't like it if it happened to you so yeah man I'm play this poorly but I hope you understand it is really hate themselves but the point of new guys that just understanding that yeah just because people you are hurt hurt other people doesn't mean you have to attack them back you know even if they have a bad take or a bad idea have this comics about this person being canceled insult but new guy steps in I was created to be the butt of an in joke but through love support and kindness you turn me into something amazing for 2020 new guy new guy overboard a lot of these back and forth interactions on the internet it's nice to see you someone be like all right from now on no more of this you know so yeah there's a ton of really funny fan arts and and Comics memes about this new guy I also like this person who pointed out just how shape language usually aggressive David's triangular and static and trustworthy are square-shaped so they literally just made themselves into a villain and the same person try to make us a bad person as someone trustworthy it's so unintentional and tone that it created this really strange phenomenon which I endorse I think it's great when you're supposed to be the dumb guy but at the end you turn into the good guy so cute you're part of the reason I wanted to delete Twitter because I was so sick of people just yelling at each other it just felt so unproductive it's like what's play this what's the end game it's just a waste of time and energy so yeah I hope that Spirit Carries On it brought a smile to my face and it's nice to see as an outside perspective even though I'm technically involved in a really weird way new guy employee of the month so that's it for all the news this week also World War 3 is happening thank you guys for watching I'm signing off hey Google hey hey hey hey Google now you are entering a new era but you shall craft thy own poop what's
