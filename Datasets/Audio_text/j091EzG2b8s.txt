welcome to the yearly let's complain about YouTube Rewind 2019 Edition I have returned from exile thank you YouTube God I exist now after 2 years of being excluded play YouTube Rewind and complaining about it every year I am finally in YouTube rewind this is so awesome everyone is going to love you to rewind now that I am in it oh no oh God oh God despite YouTube's best efforts YouTube Rewind it's still a disaster this is so sad F's in the chat they actually showed me this rewind before I actually got to see it and I got to give feedback on it and they took some of my feedback listen it's not my job to create this they just showed me the finalized product okay this is not how I would do it okay if I can control rewind we'll get into I would make it regardless I do find it kind of funny cuz it's almost like they try to avoid all the politics that went on play previous ones of who are they going to put up there and who are they going to celebrate and what things are going to celebrate and they just said okay we'll just show the top ones and then that the way you can't complain and I just completely backfired and when I saw it I'm like oh that makes sense actually this way they avoid I'm complaining about it cuz it's just the list you can't complain about list this is democracy this is what you said you like this video is not I wasn't planning to make a video on this because just like everyone when you watch the reaction is just yet there's not much to say about it it's kind of boring it's a WatchMojo video that's what everyone sentiment when they react to YouTube Rewind but I thought let's go through it anyway and I can get my thoughts on it because that's the yearly tradition of this channel I find it funny that people thought this was like a preview of rewind do what I didn't even realize it was the actual that is so awkward to watch what does the word that's the first word I love Ethan screenshot so good okay don't start with Casey neistat I'm sorry I like Casey neistat don't get me wrong but he's been in every rewind ever at this point and also him yelling K-pop it was Will Smith going yeah if I can you control rewind I will get get back Will Smith and recreate that beautiful moment where he goes yeah that would have been cool I wouldn't I'm fat Marquez did a video with Will Smith even and made him react to that Meme I thought it was so good discourse object sorry I'm already going off tangents that is so awkward YouTube Rewind 2018 the most disliked video in the history of YouTube in 2018 we made something you didn't like so in 2019 let's see what you did like because you're better at this than we are I know they didn't mean for this is ducks come across as a tiny bit passive aggressive riding wording it that way listen maybe if I was hired I could have given better feedback all I hate this clip for the shoe it pisses me off every time I don't know why I know everyone hated it because it's like oh I can just look that up but when I watched it I what's the surprise when I saw some of the top videos I'm like oh really damn we'll get to that I guess I have no idea what that video is the most liked Creator videos play Shane Dawson School I think Mr B's deserves to be number one he had an amazing year obviously but you know the title is make this video of the most liked video on YouTube the whole goal of this video this is not me being salty but I'm being number one but the whole point of this is to get that metric you know so beats the whole purpose of you made this the most liked video well it doesn't give a genuine reflection of what the year is that's my point right it doesn't capture the moments of of what happened last year and I feel like that's the whole problem with this they try to avoid text which makes sense but then you lose the reflection of what the year was and I think this is a good example of that I don't care about music videos I'm you can move on most light dance videos play Roblox is apparently huge Jesus Christ what is this game get on a free fire add 30 billion views what what this is like a fortnite pubg clone and it has I've never heard of it almost more than GTA Jesus Christ Minecraft 100 billion baby goddamn damn that's nuts you know I always avoid the top games like my I used to avoid Minecraft and I don't like fortnite cuz you're so lame I guess Minecraft sort of became cool again but still all right most liked Beauty videos I guess they have to have this cool I don't care let's move on this new Creator breakouts it's good that they had this cuz obviously if you're just with this top fast forward you're just going to get my the top graders going to get Monopoly and that's not fair either industry plant I'm just kidding oh again there's not much to say about it and then they had the most viewed creators as he land what Mr B's Dude Perfect David dobrik jelly 2.5 days play Nation Channel had 2.8 billion I never even heard of that's nuts and I honestly was shocked what's my cell phone number one I didn't know 4 billion bro that's freaking nuts dude 4 billion my videos aren't even good how will people not realize this yet then they had to Celebration of of do things like top female artists and friends and first Middle East and created to hit 10 million subscribers and yada yada yada and you know I understand that it doesn't really play fit to put a ticket in there somewhere for those who don't know I think it was a YouTuber that passed away last year he Comm suicide he definitely deserves to be recognized in some way I understand that it doesn't really fit in this format but they ultimate space for it in my opinion I didn't even think about it when I gave feedback to be honest but it's still it's so obvious I find it kind of funny cuz everyone the moments that happened personal favorite moments and there you go there you have an actual reflection of what happened this year in case I versus Logan and PewDie they've somehow managed to do it so it isn't impossible huh some other apparently congratulations got more likes than number 8 but they didn't include it okay so there were some politics involved I've watched her last year's as well and oh my God it was so much worse than I remember Jesus Christ so bad and all the preaching it and but I didn't think this year was that bad that was my genuine reaction I don't think it's that bad I don't think it's that I don't think it's that big a deal but clearly these videos have worked themselves up to be something really big for the platform it's almost like it's become a way for people to just unleash all their frustration with YouTube into one spot like that's what it feels like it's become let's read some comments as well only reason I watched this is to see if they put Felix and Martha's wedding that's it last year you made something with the most disliked so this year let's try to break that wreck okay all right I feel like the the unnecessary hate is play kind of crazy as well it doesn't feel like a YouTube Rewind to me well no one likes you to rewind why would they try and capture but I think that's the point people did used to like everyone's like the 2015 one was great people really like that it was very very popular and that's crazy to looking back on these but the problem is that along the way these YouTube Rewind girls became more and more of an advertising reel and made it so that we can only show the the top friendliest creators preachy and it became cringey and it stopped becoming a reflection of what the year was and more just over hey look advertisers look how epic our website is and it just became more and more learn more you know YouTube probably spend millions and millions to create these videos and that's an investment for them to make so that I can get more advertises on onto the platform but when in reality 2018 wasn't a good year for YouTube a lot of creative were frustrated and shoving this video into your face was probably the worst thing you could possibly do so it's like this year they just giving up on on the advertising real thing and you know people made the joke like what I could have added to this rewind did they pay an intern 500 bucks or something like that it's obviously if they can't make an advertising deal out of it why would they spend the money on it and it makes perfect sense from that perspective they did engage with people making love that rewind in the comments on Twitter which I thought was funny wow YouTube Rewind 2019 was just an upgraded version of top 10 anime list how are we supposed to make memes out of this come on Peak 2019 mood being mad that you to rewind any give enough rewind video what ship is already sailed people know that YouTube is not out to make itself a better platform for viewers or creators throughout to make it better and safer for it takes one click to figure that out when you go to YouTube homepage when you're not signed in all you get as a recommended or available watch right away is Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Fallon slapping his fucking desk and pissing his pants shit and that's what we won the game secretly we want the cringe we want to see Keanu say your breathtaking to baby Yoda and we all love to hate YouTube Rewind at this point let's get real here so you think email from YouTube about promoting rewind if I am tweeting about YouTube Rewind and I asked I need to post a call to action question to my fans like what was your favorite part of rewind tag YouTube Rewind and then when people respond to me and use the hashtag they'll get a surprise and a delight someone from YouTube will random select people that respond to me to give them wait for it a fanny pack YouTube wanted Ethan to post what was your favorite part of rewind and the top comments will get guys what was your favorite part of YouTube Rewind 2019 fanny pack question mark that's pretty much all my thoughts that I had on 2019 rewind I know not very exciting but there's not much to work with I wonder what they should do you at this point like what can YouTube do to have a successful rewind because clearly they've done it before I think that's really it I just need to go back to what it used to be a reflection of what the year is don't exclude creators and stop showing the same craters over over again I wonder if they will actually go back to that then or not it will be interesting to see next year what they're going to do clearly this new form I'm going to work out well but it still didn't do as bad as last year so hey that's an epic win what do you think would make the perfect rewind I think that's how are you going to get people involved like if I got asked to be in rewind 2020 I'd be like I don't know about this you got to you got to have to prove yourself first kind of all right that's it hope you guys enjoy this video see you bye-bye hey hey oh actually guys make this the like the video so next year we can be part of rewind but you shall craft tonight the hour of fox when you are seated on the porcelain Throne pooping is the game to play I'm not
