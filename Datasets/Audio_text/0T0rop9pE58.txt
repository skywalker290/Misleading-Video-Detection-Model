Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus I think that's enough of a different phone that deserves its own video and it'll get that but I've been using the Galaxy Note Plus for about the last week daily and I have some thoughts so this is actually my favorite Samsung design SmartPhone by just a little bit the rest yes they're all kind of the same slab of Glass and Metal but the note is always a little boxer than the others a little bit more squared and and edge-to-edge and I actually like that a lot it's still aluminum on the sides and then glass on the front nothing into the back with the slopes and curves but the phone for whatever reason is just a little bit lighter than you'd expect it to be like it's a huge phone but not that heavy but that's nice I guess and then Samsung has done build quality really well for years now fully ip68 assistant as you'd expect the display comes all the way to the edges and the corners the camera bump on the back is there but is not too much what's that it affects typing on a flat surface and for once all the ports on the bottom of the phone line up through one line of symmetry nice we all seem to have something to say about this crazy Aura glow color there are other colors of the Note 10 plus but you might not even do you know about those because this is the one that gets all the attention it's almost like they saw Huawei is three color gradient phone getting a little popular and they're like wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold up what if we just give them all the colors so now you have this crazy psychedelic every color look so it looks impressive camera but it's really mostly more of a shimmery silver most of the time you're looking at it in real life and then the best way to get those colors to pop in photographs and things like that is to shine a lot of light on it at the right angles but on top of that it's also a mirror finish find a fingerprint magnet earning it I guess my award for most difficult phone to make videos of of all time the question is would I'm still skin it or put a case on it like pretty much everyone does with every other phone and I think just because of the fingerprints I'd end up getting it but play good news is if you grab a dbrand skin you'll still kind of get some of the bits of psychedelic rainbow colors picking up a little bit so I'll link description for the channel sponsor below if you want to check those out so I guess final word on the build big glass phone again you know but it's that's a nice shape and I like to build quality over some of the other big glass phones so I like it there's only two things that they change that were questionable when is the button placement it's now just the power button and volume rocker and they're both on the left side and then there's nothing on the right side of the phone at all I personally prefer the power button on one side and volume on the other but this wasn't so bad to get used to and the whole Bixby thing is actually incredible you can set a long press of the power button to just open the power menu instead of Bixby so you can essentially what's accidental Bixby presses forever which is great but the other one is the headphone jack or the lack thereof and this was a tougher the stomach for a lot more people the Galaxy Note the phone that's been known to do it all the big phone with the room for all the big features get rid of the headphone jack like not a couple more months Samsung you couldn't have waited till the Galaxy S7 or something like that you had to get rid of it starting with the in a flagships seems like kind of a weird choice but that's how you know it's dead so if you really need a headphone jack in your next phone you can now cross Samsung flagships off your list because there's no way the S11 has one either and I've said in the salt in the wound here is the speaker on the Note 10 isn't exactly great either but hey at least they put play BBC headphones in the box and there's a growing world of good wireless headphones out there so it's just the world we're in now the fingerprint reader has moved turn the glass on the Note 10 just like on the S10 and it's still just a half a beat slower and a half a little bit smaller than the one Bluetooth from the OnePlus 7 Pro you can see in a side-by-side the difference if you open up and unlock your phone many many times a day like me you will kind of start to notice this I was hoping the ultrasonic fingerprint reader would be better by now but that waiting game continues it's definitely not nitpicking at this point but then again when a phone cost $1,100 you really should be nitpicking at this point right so on the subject of nitpicking the display no pun intended it's beautiful right what's 6.8 inch corner to corner 1440p AMOLED panel very bright great colors and customizable play profiles like I said goes right up to the corners tiny bezels like I mean almost not even there anymore and the edges roll over the sides quit but not as dramatically as they used to and the ultrasonic fingerprint reader is underneath it and it's been one of the best phone displays in the industry for multiple years running a little bit of off-axis color shift but it's nothing too drastic you know you see it on some OLED panels but overall it's not too bad it's just a pleasure to fat butt and you probably saw this but coming from a mile away but it's 60 that is my sticking point again I just came from the OnePlus 7 Pro which had a 90 HZ display and I've been using other high refresh rate stuff the I Pro is 120 HZ the Rog phone the Razr phone and I love it it's one of those things you can't unsee the this is actually really noticeable as far as smoothness and perceived speed like even if things are happening at the same speed they feel faster on the high refresh rate display but I really miss it in the Note 10 I really wish the Note 10 had a smooth High refresh rate play even just 90 HZ I don't need the full 120 and I'm pretty sure Samsung can do it fairly confident they're already making high refresh rate what's for other phone oems but it's not in the note so again to keep up my nitpicking the phone that's supposed to have everything doesn't I have just this one thing that happened to really like the infinity o display with this little hole punch cut out at the top for the front facing camera it's totally fine with me it disappears to my eye pretty quickly since there's almost no information ever up there in the middle of the top of the screen and the cutout is play some small cuz there's no extra depth sensor or any of that stuff and speaking of cameras the set of triple cameras on the back of the Note 10 are you familiar essentially the same as what we've seen from the Galaxy S10 it still has the Dual aperture main camera which I think a lot of people forget about like they could have ditched this and many people would never have noticed but they kept it and there's also two times telephoto camera and an gigantic leap forward with their cameras over the past couple years but it feels like that's mostly because they were already pretty good still top three or four out of all the smartphone cameras right behind your classic pixel and iPhone and you got to get it up there with Huawei when it rains and colors are still great and as you can see even a pretty good amount of overall contrast to bring in some real shadows and I feel like I've not consistency between the three cameras get better and handle more challenging shooting scenarios overall as well so that's just the beauty of competition photography is the software just keeps getting better and better a new feature they talked about is called zoom in Mike I believe so you'll be taking a video and if you zoom in whatever subject you zoomed in on you'll also zoom in the audio for that subject based on the microphones all over the camera seems fine on Galaxy Note 10 I'm convinced it's not actually like one of my favorite new things is actually that there's now a dedicated night mode that I do leave on it's kind of similar to pixels night sight almost as good but not as good but you can actually turn it on play Dark environment take a much better photo so now it's up to Apple I think as really one of the last major ones who doesn't have a dedicated night mode battery life a almost a plus it's a 4,300 milliamp hour in this phone so I love that it's a huge battery cell even though there's a whole slot in the side for a stylus it has wireless charging I really miss that a lot with 1 + 7 Pro and there's reverse wireless charging and this big Note 10 plus is capable of 45 watt fast charging which is Loki actually insane for a phone I really want to try it fast it's charging I've ever used in a phone was charged 30 so this is 50% faster than that which is crazy but either way you can expect 4 to 5 hours of screen on time every day out of this phone I've gotten with normal to heavy usage it's pretty good and speaking of that column down the side it wouldn't be a a note without that es pain so for a lot of people the S Pen is what really makes the note so special I don't know about you but I've never really been the biggest Espen user I feel like every time I'm using a Galaxy Note I try it for the first week or two and then I slowly use it less and less this new S-Pen is built a bit different it's a little bit shorter now and it's unibody of course but it'll feel pretty same idea with the button on the side and it still has that clicking back very satisfying and then also as you can see you get a blue pen what's the auraglow phone fun fact about the headlining new feature of the S Pen this year is the ability to do gestures in the air I'll tell you right now I can never quite get them to work great but even if I could I don't think I would ever use them for this sorry well actually there's going to be an SDK so that people can build in Samsung's air gestures into their apps Caesars do you know that are on the edge of their seat waiting to be able to fast forward through YouTube videos by twirling their S-Pen but it still does all of the awesome stuff the S-Pen has always done so things like annotating and turn on screenshots it's the best version of that in my opinion and handwriting recognition is cool so literally as you write its trans into actual text with OCR that is searchable in the notes app this is dope so well done Samsung and there's also all kinds of little tweaks like that throughout their software Samsung's come a long way since they introduced one UI it's still not my favorite Android Persian or skin if you want to call it that it's not the fastest updated it's not my favorite in terms of looks but it hangs and play way better than the ones that I really hate and performance despite the lack of high refresh rate are pretty awesome thanks to the big time specs Snapdragon 855 ufs 3.0 storage and 8 or 12 gigs of RAM I mean you can't really go wrong with that no heat is use multitasking great gaming is great on this huge screen it's what note users are used to so all that being said yes you know 10 is a small incremental upgrade to the note my take is that still makes it which is awesome and if you remember last year my best big phone of the year was the Galaxy Note 9 and this manages to be an upgrade in pretty much every way except for the headphone jack from that phone that's impressive because none of the updates were revolutionary or massive all that really means is like note 9 buyers don't have to upgrade to this of in fact what I think it means is if you were already a note fan this one is also going to be a great phone that you're going to like and weren't already into the idea of a Galaxy Note then this one won't really change your mind for those of us who are just really into the tech the overkill lovers the big phone users the power users the Galaxy Note 10 plus is a great phone again and it's also clearly now the favorite child among what's now a note family for Samsung the Galaxy Note 10 plus has a lot of things that the smaller note 10 doesn't have including but not limited to the support for 45 wireless charging the depth sensors on the back for are the micros hard slot the bigger RAM and storage options the much much bigger battery the 1440p display all these things only on the bigger phone but that's that's a rent for another day and a video for the future but for now what's my thoughts on Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus thanks for watching catch you guys the next one piece
