today I'm entering a bit of a competition we're doing Reddit Photoshop battles this is actually how learn Photoshop I used to do tiny like sub-community competition in like anime forums I remember how thrilling it was to submit have people vote on what you made in Photoshop I thought that was so fun even if five people participated it was still cool and that's what got me play Photoshop so I thought ultimate to some of these I really like the sealed one that was posted 11 hours ago look at our competition okay all right you all right I feel like whenever I see chins I just want to add more chins but then again there's not that much to work with maybe I can try and make the the background a little bigger see I mean already that looks this means of course we can add more chins nothing like a good chin you know what I mean you ever made something and then you realize it's complete garbage yeah okay all right I guess uncomfortable is what we're going with here I don't care if it's good it's making me laugh people that really truly question their sexuality do you think we can add a wig oh yeah oh yeah yes 10 yeah I'll freaking walrus I need something higher resolution as well okay okay okay girl keep talking all right that Shadows is really makes it come alive I think and then messing with light and stuff like that on this photo we can see that the whites are really he's got the blend on the on the top and we can't have that if we want to be like attention to detail I guess the hair is like hitting the or something look at that pretty good guess we should do the lips as well it's got a little is that joker touch to it but you know I like it I really want to hit the sparkle on the eye let's start in The Roots all that does a lot nice she has that kind of face you know it's a she or play a fun more a bit suddenly like oh I said bye yes I'm shading what you think I am shading no I don't need you to judge me for it okay all right I want to do others as well so I'm just going to end up there and save it this is actually the first time I post something like this put that was the start this is the result okay so it's uploaded I'm sorry in advance all right let's move on to the next one okay a blue whale sing what people talk about plastic in the ocean but blue whales poop come on dude that's disgusting all right that's nice that's garbage what would I do I would first cover up all the so we got a fresh Fresh Ocean nice and clean and then see what we can do with this 779 so long I'll just go into the all I guess guess it makes more sense that it ends on the app guess if you want to be picky it should like fade over time or something like he started writing Epstein that would be more faded as well I realize but I think that's good for now it makes me laugh so that's always good original remake time to comment what are the odds I can't to go back later in a few days to check what people are saying that's going to be my favorite part all right let's pick two or three more all right this is extremely difficult I mean this required immense amount of skill and technique to really Beverly pull off yeah not even worth posting I'm not oh my God Novak Djokovic playing Jesus no one submitted all right it's my turn gamer my time to shine what I like about this is that you can easily make it bigger very easily the background is essentially blue anyway there you go pretty well Blended we can make his Limbs and now we can focus on making his limbs gigantic without even having to mask a lot of it leg you know what let's just get rid of the tennis racket it looks funny if you don't have it I don't know what to do there's so many things is it funny to add this girl I don't know would it be funny 321 go yeah that works that's funny get that blue in fix the light at least try and get the shadow I don't know how I think that's pretty good to be honest I like it it was not what I was planning to make but you can that's pretty legit I'll take it I'll take one I'll take it I apologize I feel like where's a good way to start I can't wait to come back in a couple days to see when no one has commented on these yo yo yo that really
