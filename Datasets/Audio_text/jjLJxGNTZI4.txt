he was just like so excited about everything I did and when he died it was just play it in that corner you know on that corner of cheer even though I have a very supportive family and this tattoo was I got it there are two before my dad passed and I lied to him and I told him I needed to write this down because I wanted it for artwork from my but he wrote it in his handwriting and it's my first tattoo and you know and now I have it here daddy's little girl I just started so I was so cool and this is a great way to remember him I know you're very close with your family and one of the stories show how I I really wanted to and but one of the stories is it's towards the end play talking about how they let you be an individual even when you were just a young kid there were these placards
