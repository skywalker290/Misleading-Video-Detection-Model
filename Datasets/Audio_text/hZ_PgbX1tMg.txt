John Wick welcome to the show thank you for having me thank you for inviting me in how are you I'm good I'm a little sleepy today but I'm good why are you sleepy I was watching money Heist last night so I slept a little late and I had to wake up early for dub and then I have to go to the gym and then I have to go to lonavala but I'll catch up on my sleep on the way to la la sometimes become a really important part of John Ward's life because whenever I go into Instagram the first photo I see is of John wicker board coming what time does the it's like it literally seems like that's all I do but it's not so let's bust the my people think John Wikipedia goes to the gym everyday and they don't see her for the rest of the day what else goes on in a normal day in the life of John wicker I do go to name every day but we'll see it depends even when I'm shooting I make it a point to go to the gym because I don't know I just feel like it's a great start and then I'll have my 12 hours of shoot which is honestly on most of the films I've worked on what's been 16 to 17 hours of shoot and then I come back home and I sleep or if I'm not shooting I go to the gym I usually have readings I'll try to fit in a dance class I'll definitely watch at least one movie a day you have to it's like food for my soul this is a life that John V Kapoor dreamed of for so many years and now that John wicker is what's life does it feel as cool does it feel as fulfilling as what you once hoped it would be I don't know if this is point of being on set and in front of the camera and every time I'm on Saturday in front of the camera it's more than anything I could it's when I'm my most alert it's when I'm the happiest when you know when you're sitting with your director when you're with your co-worker and you're working on a scene and you find a moment of honesty and you feel like you found something you've done something that's meaningful or even if it's not meaningful if you just had like a Moment of Truth or just some fun in front of camera it's so exhilarating and exciting nothing in the world matches after that like I've had days survived on maybe like 1 or 2 hours of sleep over like the span of three for shooting days but like I swear to I've been glowing I've been happy I've been energetic and I live in days so I've had like 10 10 hours of sleep but I'm feeling tired and low because I'm not set alarm in fact everyone at Dharma and everyone that I've worked with till I get panicky when I'm not shooting my like a dance class like the gym like watching movies is all part of the job all right do you have to constantly feel like you need to be practicing and rehearsing and Finn in that Croft yeah definitely but I think I'm also so in love with it that it just makes me happy like I'm just in a better mood when I feel like I'm walking towards bettering myself bedroom lights off working at it because there's so much to learn from everyone around you from yourself from finding who he was an start like and I don't even think it's restricted to being in a classroom and learning dictionary learning dance I think it's traveling and getting the people of your country the people that you're supposed to play where they come from how they are seeing I don't know I love traveling I that's been a big on a better learning experience than any any form of classroom experience how play John V get into the skin of characters that you've never lived yourself and I'm talking here about where they might I'm from the accident that they might have the little quirks that people from certain parts I mean India is a world within itself right when you've not exposed to those people when you've not lived those lives how do you get into the skin of those characters you know I think it's very to understand that you as a person are different from each of these characters and each of these characters are different from that's different as me and you are like artists might be similar but at the end of the day we've had completely different experiences upbringings out do you know where we come from and all of those things but it's it's almost like you're playing God I think king of person you can decide the quotes that this person has where this person comes from you can create manufacture moments and I don't know it's just so exciting so what I do is like I said when I travel I like like observing people picking up things you write things down I do and I feel like that adds a little bit of clinic in completely foolish on camera but sometimes it might it might work like for ghost stories accent that Samira had the dialect accent or whatever it's exactly how awesome my I don't know if you saw her when I think in terms of Someone Like You Know playing gunjan saxena I had a real life example where she came from I spent a lot of time with her I could speak to her about things so there was a lot of clarity but then when you're making a character and making a person I find it very important to infuse that character with as much reality as you can and to understand that that person is very and from you want from other people so just to like grounded in reality I think it feels like you are wise beyond your years maybe I'm just talking shit no no no no no you don't know because like none of these things have come out yet and then they will be like what the fuc your debut film released in 2018 which was a remake of sairat and people really liked you in that film but now do you feel there's what more to prove with your second your third your fourth film I know Ghost Stories release which was a short film but really people are waiting for that next big screen right yeah but I feel like I'm making my debut again it's been so long you know and I feel like I've honestly become a different person and I think with dhadak I had the ability to objectively look at my performance and if I the things that were lacking the things that I wanted to work on and what were the things that were acting in your opinion but I think that I liked confidence I think that my language was an issue I think that I was a little stiff in places I think that one thing that I had working for me is that I tried to bring a lot of honesty to it and sensitivity so I think like the emotionality of it was in the right place I think maybe it was all hard but it a lot of technical understanding and a lot of finesse which I think made me a little I like technical understanding Maybe skip that wasn't a Polish but I think it's weird saying this about myself but I think I was I felt list on screen I think so do you feel like you were deserving of the praise that you got for that film then when you know deep down that things that you personally identified that maybe nobody else can see that I had a lot of things to work on and it helped me Beatles comments and reviews and everything and honestly I'm so happy that I had that because I've honestly really I push myself like I feel like in good I like giving it everything they better like me do but you know captain so let's see I hope people take a liking towards it but I really think it comes down to honesty and having heart and play not being guarded in front of the camera just like letting yourself be vulnerable I think what's always I think that creates the best moment so that's what I've tried to do and I've tried to polish my skills and better my ADD turn all of those things so hopefully it comes together well you know it's so weird right because in this industry in particularly when you're an actress or you're supposed to be vulnerable in front of the camera but you're not supposed to be vulnerable when you're in front of the media or when you're in front of the industry in front of your face when like it's such a double life that you're almost living with the whole point of being an every time you step out and it's not in front of I don't know how to do that like I've been told by so many people that I'm not ruthless enough I'm text Kendall I'm not like I'm too naive but I don't care quit like I think that the only thing that I might have going for me is that I think it's Brave to be naive and I think that's somewhere I let that show when I act I think that that vulnerability might hopefully come across so I'm scared to become thick skinned and ruthless play Pink Floyd Youtube like not let things affect me everything affects me I'm overly sensitive this business my parents never so my dad doesn't think my personality is covered but he's seen call my second phone recently and he seen some of my work and then he I mean I don't want to say much but he's he knows that anything else that I can never get myself to do but if that same amount of sensitivity makes me feel like shit in professional situations all like on social media but allows me to ball my eyes out at the what's the heart in front of a camera then and it's hard to do that but I think it's worth it like I think part of cry in front of the camera I think it's hard to be emotional I think it's hard to show I think about come Hotel on YouTube like I'm looking for that I want to find that and retain it I don't want to let myself get thick skin on harsh I'm paranoid about it almost but you know when you're in an industry like like Bollywood what is built on the star system as well and where your your worth in the market depends on how successful your films you look like what you wear where you go who you speak to how do you retain your authenticity how do you who made yourself when there are so many people around you telling you how you should behave in this industry it's very easy to believe that you are like the shit like you're amazing and everything you're doing is the best decision about and it's very easy to convince yourself that your shit also like you're nothing so I think the most important thing is to understand that I don't know maybe this is a naive thought also but I think all comes down to your work and if your concentration is solely on bettering your craft and your work are you working honestly and working really really hard then the road might be longer but you'll get what you're supposed to get you what do you want to get just keep your head down and keep working at it all this noise I find very distracting and it's easy to get play caught up in it how do you make sure that this doesn't impact you more than it just being a job it does impact you more than just being a job because it's such an emotional profession there's no it's not a 9 to 5 job you can't leave it behind you live with it at least for me I eat breathe live everything is about films is about the work that I'm doing I'm constantly thinking about characters and moments play music I'll wake up in the middle of the night and I feel like I need to see that one scene from tamasha that I need to see that one moment in American play with Amy Adams when she made that switch and I need like it's it's constant but I love it like you're so consumed play like I'm so lucky to be able to do it and there's no other way to be I'm in a place of privilege where I've had this opportunity come to me I can't for a second take it for granted I'm constantly wired up and it's exhausting my dad thinks I'm obsessive about it I haven't seen my results come to fruition yet maybe play do I'll be a little relaxed about it but I hope I'm not I hope I'm not like I said I my hard work and my sincerity are the only weapons that I have right now find I need I need to keep it as close to me as possible so I know you also grew up on all those kind of late 90s early Northeast Derma movies as well play 3DS Yokai but I think I'm more in admirer of I mean I'm but I spend more I think I should eat more to older films films of the 60s and the 70s Maybe I'm all 50s and 60s I would say I delete more to this style of acting when I think have you been born into the wrong generation I swear to God like I want to play these characters the way that Madhubala was in Mr and Mrs bachpan her comic timing I want to be home now John you might get to be I think I but you know when you have that much enthusiasm for something and you're that invested in something industry is also very fickle things don't happen as much as they do happen and there is a lot of like films getting shelved there is a lot of like Arielle play chips that get burned there is there's just a lot better so is it better just not to have expectations in this industry put is that possible it's like it's like getting into a relationship with someone you fall in super hard and then being like this isn't going to go anywhere but then what's the point then don't be in it how can you not expect can I expect the world from every opportunity that I get and of course it's disappointing when stuff gets delayed and doesn't work out the way that you've planned but I think everything happens for the best you said do you have the you have the world of expectations from this place but you think the world has loads of expectations from you too yeah but I think that I gave them a reality check with her and this is but yeah they do have a lot of expectations but I mean of course they do why wouldn't they I think my mom and my family has given them so much in terms of entertainment content give an Indian Cinema so much and they've given mom and dad and everyone so much love and an appreciation that honestly the life that I'm living the opportunities that I have is all because of these people's love all of the alarm so I mean of course they'll expect that's a lot of bag play imagine it's like it's like I know that they expecting much more than they would have other people maybe more than I can deliver but if I know that that's what they expecting at least I'll reach like close to it as opposed if I do a bad minimum job and then they'll be like oh pleasantly surprised that I can breathe on screen you know do you think people are to you as well because of the Goodwill they have towards your parents I think some people are nicer to me because of the Goodwill and some people Play Joshua because of because of my parents as well I think even that is just noise because it's going to boil down to me and what I have to offer maybe not in my first film maybe in my second maybe in my third but it it will boil down to what I have to offer and I think that people will start seeing me for who I am and what I have to offer because I'm very my boyfriend tell us genetic similarities but I'm different from my mom and my dad I have something to say that individual to who I am and I think that my choices hopefully will be a reflection of that even when we're sitting here doing this interview do you feel like you have to be careful about what you say or how you say it when you're talking about tell me when you're talking about your parents because I feel like everybody just has this image etched out of what John wicker was should be like and you should behave and how grateful she should be or how independent she should be in I mean I wouldn't know how on Earth I would handle it if I was you you know that was the point that I used to feel like I need to cater to some sort of idea of how people think I am but I think that people are smart and they recognize honesty and I think that what they value most of someone who's comfortable enough to be themselves and I honestly don't put the headspace to try to be anything else anymore but you like you said you tried that one point I don't know if I tried I think when I was promoting the dog if there was a phase where I was unsure of who I was and what I need there was so many people telling me things and there was so much going on in my personal life and professionally that it was just I think I was numb and I think I was very like shut down and I think a lot of people perceive that as oh she's your oh she's cold or she's not busy and I got that a lot because after that when I started going for meetings and meeting completely do you still think about how much you let people in I don't think about it but see all of these things that you said I am grateful I am independent but I'm comfortable knowing who I am I'm not I'm not like your voice precious girl I'm not your overly intellectualized Yanni I'm not like someone who's loved by everyone all across the board but I I I'm just trying to do what I love when you're saying I'm not loved across the board but you nothing to piss people off either I've done nothing to prove that I'm deserving of all of that love either you've got your head screwed on properly if you can think simply at this early on stage in your career are you ever worried about losing that perspective the more famous you become yeah I I am in fact I think that I make a cons for to try to keep it in check I don't think I'm like intelligent or anything I just think that I'm happy play my priorities and the way that I look at things so like I remember I was sing for gunjan rules and ghosts simultaneously and then I had a break and then I started dostana and relatively light of film and and I just remember constantly thinking is this feeling too easy am I doing enough is this making sense am I taking things too lightly so it's a constant battle and then I don't know there was a point where I do try to keep it in check but honestly what can you do I think it's I'd I think that it's embedded in your DNA and it's how you've been conditioned and brought up and you know I have my mom's energy with me I don't think she let me derail like that and even if I do I'm sure it's for a reason and I learned from and I'll use it to better myself or my life in some way song you mentioned your mom again animal comfortable place now talking about your mum than you were when you were promoting time and that's completely natural do you feel a sense of carrying her leg forward I feel a responsibility towards the people and towards the work that she's done because even Beyond her work I think she led her life with so much dignity and so much grace how much innocence that I have seen her retained for like throughout her life it's call me to safeguard yourself from just how corrupt the world but she did it she was pure and that's how her and Dad have tried to bring me and Khushi up so I think more than spell decisions more than the technicalities of it I think being when is what I strive to be what are the kind of things on The Hit List that you want to achieve like let's let's realistic kind of time span on it let's say like in the next 5 years what things would you have liked John wicker of to have achieved in the next 5 years I want the whole country's love like I want is there any abundance I think that I don't even know if it's a slightly patriotic feeling but I just I feel so much love for my people and I've traveled the world I really don't think that there are the weather Indians are the kind of love that the shower upon you I haven't seen it anywhere else in the world and what was that song about like I want to be their favorite and their number one I really want to touch their lives with my work I don't know if I don't know if that can be Quantified to like box office collections or movie reviews but I know I feel it when I have it I want to do meaningful work I want to be remembered and I want to get my own path and I want to learn I want to learn so much I want you know all these moments that I need to wake up at night and turn on NC I want to create those moments it's been such a pleasure getting to know you better this is exactly what we want to do we wanted to come get to know the girl behind the movies and we wanted to get to know you better before you're going to be on this crazy amazing run in 20 I wish you all the very best of luck and thank you so much
