hey hey there is currently construction going on in my office so instead of setting up an awkward camera in my home I thought that would be the time to do a voiceover video I want to talk about something that's been on my mind for quite a while which is ideas around the Joker film yes I'm 2 months late for you still care about this but if you clicked hear me out I wanted to discuss not so much the film itself was more interesting to me play reaction to it and how it was portrayed and proceed by the media and the audience in general and now that the time has passed and it's sort of come conclusion so personally I was very happy when I saw the trailer had come out the Joker is already a somewhat of a subculture meme but I was mainly excited because it started one of my favorite actors who are in Phoenix English language please I think he's a phenomenal actor and I know he would fit this it's perfectly a quick side note here is that in the previous film that featured the Joker in Suicide Squad the performance was play Jared Leto which was a questionable display and according to the Hollywood Reporter later was fuming over not being cast of That's the new Joker in this film and I think it's so funny when people are upset over something they have no right to be upset about letter is a good actor and all but when you're sending allegedly according to him use condoms anal beads live rats to people on the set I think he is call Jared since I don't like to talk about it I guess that's just what happens when you're so epically immersed in the character of the Joker on another side note I think the fact that Jared Leto who previously won an Oscar contrasting quacking who never won one play Lady deserves to there's probably many reasons to why he hasn't won but I think part of the reason why is because Joachim is weird this movie is it's such a heart when I cried three times during the course of it I don't believe you've ever cried in your life I've been meaning video on him just him because I find him very interesting he's the kind of person that you don't really know where to place him and he clearly start and plays on that but those kind of people are hard to attribute Awards to and I think that's why that's exactly the reason why quacking fits so perfect play this role anyway the trailer came out it all look great people are very excited but the media's reaction slowly started to become weird talking about how Joker Is A Dangerous film bringing out the worst of the internet talking about how killing Rampage would encourage cat attacks talking about it's dangerous message or insult culture male rage the list went on it went on so much that Philip the creator of the film even had to step in and say publicly hey I really think there's been a lot of think pieces written by people who say they haven't even seen the movie and they don't need to I would just argue that you might want to watch the movie you might want to watch somehow glorified Insel press interview with Joaquin Phoenix and the telegraph they asked Phoenix directly are you concerned that the Joker might perversely end up inspiring exactly the kind of people it's about with potentially tragic result Joaquin walked out and left the interview and he won't even worse from here the military the US Military should a warning to troops about the premier event it was almost as if media was bracing for impact that something bad was going to happen but then the movie fin mental health unfortunately this didn't change the narrative from media that it was still a dangerous film but I think Tell me about the movie seem to have mostly inspired or to have a bunch of kids dancing at a staircase so was it all in overreaction concerns came from what happened 7 years ago in 2012 Aurora Colorado during which took place at a movie theater but it wasn't just any movie theater it was during The Dark Knight Rises the Batman film and Iris had red dyed hair and it was told that the shooter called himself Joker so maybe the media is criticism over its film to release except this wasn't the truth according to the district attorney it never happened Colorado officials send it to clarify for years that the terrorists never referred to himself as the Joker quote the story has persisted because it fits the Nar guy who shot up the Batman Premiere thought he was the Joker of course and yet it has no connection play reality The Narrative about the Joker association with violence was false The film's Dark Knight was targeted because it was the biggest movie premiering time there was nothing more to it but despite all the negative press that recent Joker film received the movie was still a huge success it rack 93.5 million on its opening which is a record for any October debit film it became the highest gross R-rated film of a little bit for me but it was a really great film and I don't think the movies without criticism is my point I'm not what Times magazine would call astonished defender of it but people have been blaming movies Games music as problems for other people's behavior for decades instead of blaming you know the people themselves hell I've even so why do we do this well it's easy emotions run high it's hard to think rationally you want an easy solution to complex issue but I would argue it's time to be more responsible and look at the bigger picture the reality is that hate isn't going to stop existing I'm not going to pre play I know how to stop hateful acts from happening but there are two things about hate that I do know number one it feeds off reactions this may seem like play obscure example but during World War II in Japan there was a big concern by people that most of it's beautiful and cultured read structures would get destroyed by the fire bombings that went on in Kyoto where one of the most beautiful structures resides which is the golden temple was miraculously preserved throughout the war but ironically the temple was destroyed shortly after the war ended anyway and it wasn't from any war or it was burned down by an arsonist who tried to commit suicide but was caught before and later diagnosed at schizophrenic his motivation was to quote retaliate against society never heard that before right to me it begs the question if the concern for the temples protection would it still have been burned down Society saw unlikely event as a potential tragedy and it came true just not the way they had expected that's right to me the concern for a shooting in a cinema my take place which is by the way a valid opinion to have I'm not saying you're wrong to be concerned about but it could be potentially a dangerous thing to highlight just so heavily I understand that it's not just one person's fault either for dressing what could potentially be an issue with a film but since so many articles came out prior to its release without admittedly haven't even seen it it was all just not pure recklessness my second point that I know about hate is that he wants to be recognized not every I'm about a lot of times the movie actually depicts is accurately and Outkast a lot of time one attention they want to be heard even if it's a Brett this is I think an inherent hate trading people that wouldn't come from any inspirational Source just don't give it to them Arthur in the film was lucky to get on television as a platform to get his attention by coincidence by racing concerned that someone might do something Shuffle you're basically filling a void for someone to step in and take the publicity it's sending a dangerous message to people that we are concerned something what happened we will platform that bad thing if it does happen Arthur gets put on television just to be ridiculed his performance on the show is what full which forms the Joker the irony being that the media helps create bad people while platforming them all while simultaneously thinking Play Eminem every right to walk out of that question
