oh my God PewDiePie's quitting YouTube have you heard about it from news media good evening I'm Bobby's Maria PewDiePie has quit YouTube the story is everywhere YouTube me play PewDiePie quotes PewDiePie reveals real reason he has quit YouTube yes quit everyone did you know did you know PewDiePie's quit King PewDiePie quotes YouTube If this is so sad no more PewDiePie guess it's just going to be me now Papi PewDiePie world's biggest YouTube Star PewDiePie quotes saying he's feeling very tired boo hoo hoo I especially like the CNN one cuz it's basically PewDiePie who became one of YouTube's biggest stars before we're seeing his career dog navigations of racism and anti-Semitism will be away for a little while PewDiePie is taking a break because the racism man I can't believe this God blown up I am blown away play blown up you know this is posted not just saying if you're from I don't know anywhere in Europe or whatever this your local can I have reported on this as well because it's just one of those stories that caught fire for whatever reason I think first of all we should look at what I said but I think the contrast is so funny it was at the end of my last few poppy Samurai I reported on it making break from YouTube next year I wanted to say it in advance because I made up my mind I'm tired I'm tired I'm feeling tired I don't know if you can tell just so you know early next year I'll be away for a little I'll explain that later but I wanted to give head that's it that's all I said early next year I'll be away for a little while I never I said I'm quitting I said I'm taking a break I find it so funny because the reason why I announced it at the end of a no and I hate the announcement of the announcement it's so annoying right the reason why I did it because I didn't want to play it I just wanted it to be I I want to make a surprise for my audience as well and being like all right then quit thing cuz that's what YouTubers would do if they go on a break they would go like I'm quitting PewDiePie quotes you know it's done before I get it but I didn't want to do that I don't want to make a big deal out of it and then out of people news media blows it up why do I have more Integrity than fucking news media this makes this is so wrong this is all backwards I think this is a common practice in media where one person got it wrong so we can all just get it wrong right it's so dumb well these all these other news stories every part of the wrong news so we can all report I don't want to be all fake news but it is that it is I don't know I don't understand why no one reads this stuff cuz it's so oh here we go Disney inward search ADL there we go we hit them all you just got to get them all out there in 20 years from now I quit YouTube and do you think people will post like 20 years ago we remember he said the n word you guys remember that know I will not get my oh my God this is so obnoxious how many pop-ups do you buy releases game for making food thank you for posting that it's taking a break from the platform that launched him to wait what the vlogger that's right yeah I don't know why they referred to it as a vlog so I had this low quality version of cuz they changed the title he doesn't want to think about vlogging anymore when did I say that they put it in what is that do they use those Apple Store to be like oh no it's not an actual quote it's just that we just make it it's your play my Twitter so that now they can put quit Twitter because of this I got a lot of Boomers who don't know who I am and they just read that I made 25 million and they're like my job is so hard I don't make 25 how dare he take a break how could he take a break my job harder and I make less money I feel I have to explain why I'm taking a break now just because this is just going to become weirder oh wait there was another sentiment I read and I was really funny broke the news to heartbroken fans in the latest punished video no one on my fans for heartbroken they I was going to take a break anyway and that's why I wanted to make Claire that I decided that I'm going to do it and the reason why no one of my friends are heartbroken is because understand that is normal to just take a break I didn't see anyone say oh my God this is so sad they already knew why are you making that up all right this is address to all the Boomers I've been uploading YouTube videos every single day for 10 years YouTube is the kind of job that isn't very stable they're always changing legislation and and rules and policies and blah blah and it's such a new thing that any day it could be over for anyone and and that has been the process for a lot of YouTubers in the past so since I'm beginning this opportunity to be a YouTuber I decided I'm going to make the most out of it no matter what and I've done that and I think a lot of my says comes from the fact that I am so consistent with on this platform I don't pre-record videos because I think that loses his touch there's a lot of things like that God damn this sounds so pretty it's the point is I thought you two would be over by now for me I thought I would be last like 2 years something like that but here I am I don't want to look at myself another 10 years in the future and I've done the exact same thing as I've done now even though I really enjoy and love I don't want to look back on my life 20 years later I'm like oh cool so I just did YouTube videos and I never ever did anything else it just seems kind of sad to me another reason I think it's important for anyone to take a break no matter what job you have it I think that's and that so much has happened this year that I have just been building up and up and up and up and I never I never taken a break before I don't know what it feels like to not worry about uploading a video even when I am away on on certain things I'm still uploading during that time just still monitoring the video I'm still making sure everything is is good in micromanaging and I've never just had a full stop so I want to know what that feels like that's it I didn't want to make a big deal out of it but now I feel like I was forced to explain it plus it will be so sometime next year we even kept the honeymoon 5 days like even things like that as a minimum and that's just kind of sad and I think it's gotten the point where okay it's cool I love you too but if I want to keep it going I kind of want to change a couple things and be able to not be strict whether it's like if you're an entrepreneur you put your heart and soul and and you work your ass off to make this project work that simmer down and you let it let other people take control or you might sell the company or whatever are you but for me the project is myself I'm still I can't sell myself I can't let someone else step in so it's it's so I'm 100% solely Dependable if how this channel is doing so it's hard to just slack off do you understand does that that's cool I don't I didn't make the whole thing to be boohoo me oh it's so hard I want to break that's not it at all just I'm very happy to be in this situation I'm not trying to I don't want people sympathy I never Next News another story that interested me was the fact that tanamongeau YouTube streamy Awards you to put the actual logo on this shit really okay here's the nominees for creator of the creator of the Year why does their overlay look like the H3 H3 podcast she's nominated for creator of the Year know she doesn't leave platform for traditional media as well that's hilarious there's stop now on YouTube between creators and the ones that are so desperate to be validated by by mainstream media Loren gray I don't even know who that is ninja ninja I don't know my dad watches her epic a kids channel describe has been insane it's like the one channel that doesn't have any big controversy he's done good on this on the platform what he's done so many other YouTubers try and replicate it's obvious some of the other nominations wait did you see the name of that who you think it is it is not David dobrik I'm sorry David but you've won like every award tonight it's only fair Tana oh my God I'm so shocked how did I Wendy's really nice can I have to come out in her pajama she still made it to the show it's so crazy to rip on Hannah like who's insufferable I don't want to make a whole deal out of it and I stood right here a year ago and I literally held Shane Dawson's award in the first thing I said to all of you people was like I will never be I'm so glad they filmed on Gus Johnson's reaction yes guys when Donna said I don't deserve this we all felt that cancel all the people who don't feel like creator of the Year bye she's so humble she doesn't feel like creator of the year she's so down to earth she's just like us know you really don't deserve it that's why feel like that I'm not actually mad about this because everyone knows award shows are just fake anyway it's all politics it's put on who is there they want to be sure that they're giving away Awards to people instead of just having people show up in videos or not so the people that play into the whole award show thing are the people that get the award I literally gotten shows writing to me saying hey we want to give you this award but you have to come there to get it and it's like no I don't want it then it doesn't mean anything I literally don't even keep my words that I have actually gone because I don't feel proud of him I think it's it doesn't mean sing but I think the main reason you know it's fine that it is that way but it is also kind of sad because I think it could be cool to actually have it as a way to actually celebrate the people that did something amazing this year just like we won could be something like that right a do you know what people accomplished or made a Mark or made an impact I think that's what it that's literally it it doesn't have to be more than that oh yeah and this was fun as well so it's it's not about who made the most impact its who can get the Their audience to vote the most amount of times right who can get the audience to give you this award basically and if that was genuine as well like if no one if it was just and no one's told anyone to go there specifically but if you tell your audience over and over to go and vote for you then yeah it doesn't that kind of feed the he would win but what kind of award is that to accept and it's so funny to me how as if the award was actually chosen to her play mainly cuz she promotes drugs to her in 14 year old audience I don't know how they are but it's like weed legal there I always have a pill bottle filled with Adderall days like this I really love my life turn on Joe driving and I was like marijuana that's creator of the year I don't mean to bring up a bunch of old stuff and I don't want to do the whole media meme but I generally haven't Jake Paul and tana and TV show was canceled after announcement 3 days ago all right that's all the news for this few news I hope you guys enjoyed smash like subscribe and good guys I have an announcement next year I'm taking a break from Snapchat I know and my LinkedIn profile I'm what about taking a break from that as well hopefully news for me there will not get the story right this time but I think I'm
