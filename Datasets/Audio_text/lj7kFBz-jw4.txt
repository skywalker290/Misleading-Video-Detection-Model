hey what's up guys here so if you remember that Services Apple event back in March that weird one the one actual piece of Hardware technically that was just at that event was this shiny new titanium Apple credit card called Apple card well now it's August and actually have one now here so we have to answer the question what would it be like if Apple made a credit card so this is the car itself like I mentioned it's made of literally titanium play White on the front and the back super clean as you'd expect from Apple hardware and it's got this precise laser cut out with your name on the front and the Apple logo and the chip of course and then on the back is the magnetic stripe and a Goldman Sachs and MasterCard so the issuing Bank in the card provider for this guy and right off the bat I know there are other metal credit cards but I don't have any so this is very different from what's the rest of what I normally carry is the same thickness as a normal card but quite a bit heavier being metal and also play less flexible feels more durable I'm not going to try to actually break this thing but it flexes way less it's more solid and then there's this sort of look for that goes all the way around and gleams and catches in the light as you'd expect from a solid block of metal this is the wall to carry right now it's made but I don't carry cash I just have a couple cards with me and the card key actually play to get into the studio literally wrapped in a dbrand skin so I don't have to look at the brown color that it actually is but the Apple card would write into a normal wallet it's the same size as every other card not too much thicker the only thing that actually concerns me here is the finish like how does it where does it start to chip off or does it start to discolor over time not exactly sure but it does look super clean right out the box so to activate it it comes in this colorful packaging with instructions wake iPhone and hold here so I just touched the top of my iPhone right to the bottom of the card right around here and it comes up in yes just like any other pair of airpods or something to pair you activate the card here and it adds it to your wallet app and you're officially good to go this is essentially a credit card for iPhone users like that's just that's what it is meaning it's basically an extension of the Apple pay that you could already use but now in a physical credit card form so all those places that don't accept Apple pay I still want to use Apple pay so it shows up in the wallet app you have a physical card to do it and then on top of that there are a lot of legitimately nice features turn the wallet app that you may already know since it's a credit card this time there is a slider to show how much interest you'd be paying versus different payment schedules with this really clean intuitive UI the red color like actively discourages you from making the minimum payment and racking up more at The Verge actually tweeted that he noticed in the app the color gradient of the card actually means something so it starts off completely white like mine before you spend any money on anything with the card and then anytime you spend money at a different Merchant or category it adds colors to the gradient so I wanted to set out for myself yes I went to B&H and literally I pre-ordered my Galaxy Note 10 with the Apple card and sure enough instantly like literally a half a second after I press the buy button on B&H site my app populated with that purchase and added the pair to my card so I'm starting my gradient of colors now so yeah I can confirm that's what's happening here it was really impressively fast and then it do you have purchase history where you can dig into each purchase every transaction and see it on a map so if you don't recognize it you can look up exactly came from honestly a lot of stuff that I wish my current banking app also did and then I guess one of the most underrated pieces of it is it's all secured with face so even if someone finds your card or someone steals your card they can't use it because they don't have your iPhone or even if they do you can also remotely deactivate the card from the wallet app which is also where you can grab the card number if you want to pay for things online using a form like I just did with B&H and then of course it's just all so very clean there's no card number on the card that's a little more it's pretty nice actually not honest as a credit card it's actually not that amazing of a credit card interest rates are okay you know 12% and up depending on credit score if you get approved but like you know you won't see this on any best value cards lists anytime soon the one cool thing is instead of giving how many points that build up over time it just gives you straight Apple cash the next day so you can spend it 24 hours after you've earned it you get 1 send cash back on everything so like that note 10 I just bought on B&H with the card I got 1% cash back I get 2% cash back on everything that I use Apple pay for and you get 3% cash back on everything you buy from the Apple Store from Apple but hey that's what you get I don't know I kind of just see this thing as a status symbol / Flex of the decade honestly this is very gratuitous that's just what it is one thing I do have to say though just because the features are so good and so inter find with the wallet app on the iPhone Beware of the ecosystem if you thought the walls of the Jordan weren't high enough already just because people don't want to leave the iPhone because of iMessage in the green and blue bubbles people don't want to leave the imagine trying to switch to an Android phone but you don't want to now because you also have play give up your credit card like that's nuts so beware this is obviously another tool that can be used to sort of trap you in the Apple ecosystem but you already knew that right anyway thanks for watching this quick one just forget I give a quick update since there is technically actually new hardware around but that's just about all there is to it also shout out to the waveform podcast is now officially launched I'll have a link right below that like button if you want to check it out episode 1 is up and we'll have more info on that coming soon either way thanks for watching catch you guys later peace
