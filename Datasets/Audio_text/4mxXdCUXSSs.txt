all right so as far as tech people becoming billionaires and then turning into philanthropists for the greater good Bill Gates that's pretty much the gold standard as far as that goes he's on Pace to give away something like 99.96% of his wealth to raisin foundation so for those wondering what he's doing with those billions and billions of dollars every year he and Melinda dropped this annual letter where explain sort of their view of the world at that time and what they're doing about it so I'll leave the link to this year's new 2019 annual letter below but I was looking at it and this is that chat all right Mr Gates thank you for sitting down with me for a couple minutes so I'll try to learn as much from you as possible in our time play a lot of my audience will know you from your work at Microsoft a lot of tech heads watching these videos but you've also forwarded this entire I can call it career as a philanthropist that I think is equally as interesting and impressive I'll try to tie those things together first of all the annual can you summarize the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation annual letter in like a sentence or two get a chance to go all over the world particularly in Africa where a lot of our work is I'm going to a lot of classrooms where our education work is and so every year we try to think okay what what other people will be interested in in terms of new Innovations things that are going well going poorly this year we framed it you know so I was studying the population growth in different countries in the age German different countries and so you know I'm finally seeing some good technology used in the classroom to try and let the teacher focus in on really talking to the students and not just grading the homework so that was another one and it is actually quite a diverse set of things that we've made our surprise list so one of the things I read that I found really the biggest contributors to Greenhouse emissions so manufacturing agriculture Transportation the transportation one hit me because I'm really into electric cars that's one of the specific areas of tech focus on the channel so I'm curious what's your take on electric cars have you gone electric how do you feel about them well they you know Tesla is missing product that is catching on but it's still a pretty small percentage of the market it's a premium price vehicle they lost their 7,500 tax credits and it's making it tougher now ton of the other manufacturers is there going to come in partly because of the California zero emission and partly because people see these Trends they'll be a lot of great electric cars to choose from now will it get down to the volume price categories and then you know Transportation it's not just automobiles we've got trucks we got you know trains boats planes and so you know solving the entire transport sector isn't going to be easy you know transport is hard Industrial it's a wide range of Innovations we're going to need and also I read that especially in the US truck driver is an extremely popular job in fact in more than half the US truck driving is like the most popular profession in that state so it sounds like electric might not be the only solution to Transportation well the passenger car the power what you need is lower than for a truck So eventually batteries my work for a truck but it's a far difficult problem because just the weight is a is a lot higher there even those Passenger cars the electric car is still sure because of the indirect emissions from the electricity it uses and so only in the place where you both get the electric cars to be a high percentage and you get the electric sources to be zero emission the a conversation seems like it's kind of hard to ignore it in 2019 and I've had conversations with other people who are more negative about it more pessimistic tell me about just Ai and the possible downside I'm curious if you're more optimistic about the upside of AI or uses for it or possibly make an impact in and what you're trying to do is allowing us to make advances in fields that are are really important like understanding the biology of the human body it's super complicated and so if you look at all the 80 gallon cuz the sensors are getting better you know trying to understand okay how do we help people with obesity how do we take cancer where is the 0.1 interfere even the one that's really difficult is the brain is so complicated that we don't have drugs for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and so we want it not just people live longer turn to Liberty quality years and not have the medical Cosby expanding that's an area AI people feel like yeah I'm not I'm not against that so she definitely has a lot of upside as far as helping to to research certain things Define patterns that a human necessarily wouldn't have picked up things like that so in medical Fields it's useful so I agree with you on that I'm if you could give a couple short bits of good news some good progress you've observed that some I might not know about the sort of counteract the bad news everyone seems to hear about what would you say yeah the 10% of all that number is now 5% and with the right Innovations we can get it by 2030 two and a half percent so we've gone from 12 million were dying to now 6 million and so it's every year 6 mil I'm saying all these things are tricky because you don't want to say to people that we we shouldn't be mad about the remaining problems so saying that people hate feel good about the progress and still you know B the 6 million are still dying that's an interesting dichotomy it's a it's a good perspective to have cuz you have to you have to be proud of progress has been made but you still have to look forward at all the work yet to be done and that's kind of I guess what I'm wondering is my you've put billions of dollars in over a decade into the foundation's work on these issues does it make you Optum tell me about the future that that's so much progress has been done or do you look at the challenges ahead and that's like an overwhelming sort of massive amount of work in a Broadway the work has gone so well on global Health better than we expected in The Innovation and science that will give us new tools like an HIV Larry vaccine you know so in my lifetime I hope the whole issue of these diseases that are tough and poor essentially solve those problems and we're closed on on polio eradication when I look politics I have to admit that you know there's some Trends in terms of how what trust people have or how their polar I do worry about that that's not you know a deep area I don't bring unlike the biology political Trends but yes there are things that I do worry about but overall The Human Condition our ability to feed prevent disease help live an enjoyable life we are making great progress on those things so as long as we stay it makes me love the work and and remain optimistic goes as far as those successes as possible and I guess my last question would be play knowing that you're doing all this work but someone in my position I'm not a philanthropist I don't necessarily have the memes how does someone like me I wish more people could actually get to these countries you know join the Peace Corps spend time even just spending a few weeks there and see how great the needs are and see the progress in a volunteer work in the United States builds that sense of okay we care about other humans even going to beyond our own family group even people have very different experiences so you know the Young a little bit of giving money away you know to form that habit and picking which things you really want to give to including lots of things here in the US and getting involved with volunteer time those are the people who I think little help kind of bring the world together and you know avoid just this device if this that is is my greatest concern I couldn't end a Bill Gates interview without asking can you still jump over a chair that's a good question probably not and it would if it was a very small chair I'll count that as a victory that's a I play tennis so I'm in reasonable shape not my jumping skills that's all good I appreciate it thanks again for the timer
