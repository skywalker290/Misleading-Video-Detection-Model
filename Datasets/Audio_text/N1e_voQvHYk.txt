so this is the new iPad Pro it is an incredible tablet still an iPad though the new iPad Pros Hardware is actually incredible like it's the most beautiful most powerful most impressive iPad yet but thanks to iOS 12 it's just that it's just an that is not any closer to replacing my laptop use its not any more likely to be my main computer but it's EAS what's the best iPad ever let me show me so this iPad Pro looks like one of those renders of what people in the past imagine the tablet would look like 5.9 mm completely flat it has an incredible nearly bezel-less display somehow has huge really impressive speakers and super powerful solid-state insights so right off the bat there's an 11-inch or 12.9 inch version and there's a space gray or silver I will say the smaller one is much more reasonable and I think it's the one most people get but I'm big screen person so here I am with the crazy big 12.9 inch iPad Pro and I prefer space gray but that's up to you and it's just a Marvel old like they're a pretty sharp edges all the way around but I love that it's boxy like the iPhone 5S was it stands up on its own that you can hold it with a single finger in the middle of the Apple logo all of this means it's play easy to hold the edges are kind of sharp like I said and they can maybe dig into your hands a bit if you're holding it for a long time with the heavier iPad but even that nope this tablet has a plus battery life again and the speakers on either side they have Vision build holes that I just think look really good and yet again the drivers are loud they're far enough apart for stereo effect they the camera on the back is the same as the iPhone 10s and 10r and the bump is pretty big because the iPad is so but it's way over in the corner so my hands never really accidentally touch it or anything and the tablet is so big and so flat that it actually doesn't really affect lying down flat on a table thing it still doesn't Rock back and forth I guess if I had to pick something that I don't like about the design it would be actually the extra antenna lines on the cellular version which I picked they're just not symmetrical they don't look very even just a little little off looking a little the Wi-Fi version has antenna lines too but there's not as many but I'm never looking at the back of the iPad anyway so it doesn't really bother me oh and no head Jack of course but you already know how I feel about that this is Apple we're talking about here and I'm kind of already on that wireless life anyway anyway I have like little little hopes now of a new iPhone next year kind of looking like this like being really squared off and boxy but then pushing the display to the I don't know it probably won't happen if they want to keep wireless charging of course but I still would love that so clearly I like the outside play FedEx the field in the hand is awesome hardware and on the inside it gets even more impressive first of all there's no fingerprint reader no home button face ID sensors in the iPad Pro and it work now in any orientation so you can be portrait landscape upside down no matter what it works which is helpful because the fact that the front of the iPad is so uniform makes it easy to forget which what is the top sometimes you grab it and you try to unlock it in your hand is covering the sensor since the bezel is so thin but it just points a little arrow and tells you you're covering not just one of the best in any tablet but one of the best 120 HZ IPS LCD super accurate colors great viewing angles Ultra responsive and snooze and very bright when you need it true tone there also if you want it and the anti-reflective coating is great so face ID is good play as bad as good as it gets and then the specs now you've probably heard me say before about Apple products the numbers don't really matter watch and that's still true here but let me give you this 812x Bionic it is the fastest ship I've ever seen in a mobile device if you seen geekbench scores that's been pretty popular lately as benchmarking faster than play laptops rivaling the 15 inch MacBook Pro it has 4 gigs of RAM and for some reason the 1 terabyte iPad has 6 but generally performance is just really good for multitasking the flying through apps productivity photo edit it's all fast and fluid it's a plus performance just like the previous iPad Pro but now you have Headroom for days like it's more about being future proof and you're very future-proof here and then even the accessory ecosystem is all upgraded the new Apple pencil way better obviously you can't get much more Awkward than this was it's not a high bar to clear but it is now great it snaps onto the side of the iPad with and pears and wirelessly charges there there's a little cut out on the side of this all metal iPad that lets the wireless charging work through here to call the second generation apple pencil a number two pencil maybe maybe that's just me anyway there's now a new thinner folio case and a new keyboard cases well these aren't things I use very much I do sometimes have the folio on and connect via magnets throughout the whole back of the iPad and they line up really quickly and snap into place which makes them easy to put on and take off but magnet paper or something like that it has filaments inside I respond to a magnetic charge and when you pass it over something like the iPad it can show you where inside the magnets are so you put it turn on the iPad and you can see that there are magnets a lot of them everywhere all around the perimeter and they match up with the same magnet placement in apple accessories and that's what helps them lock into place so quickly and easily the pins always line up its smart and I'll leave a link below if you want to the most Apple in 2018 thing ever though is all the price hikes so every single thing we just talked about the new pencil the new folio case the keyboard case and a tablet itself are all more expensive than last year's which again you can't ignore that but you could also argue these all work so well together better than any third-party version that that's why play people including myself keep buying these so what's the holdup iOS 12 is great it's the best version of iOS yet buy a lot and it's my favorite but on this Hardware it talk to be desired like don't get me wrong it's an incredible iPad but every year when you know the new iPad Pro comes out we revisit this conversation listen to Kenneth replace my laptop can it be my primary computer you know it's it's a better performer now it's benchmarking it's got more storage than a laptop it has a better display it's a touch screen it's 120 HZ it's more expensive I wish I could replace my computer with an iPad Pro because I enjoy using the iPad watch more but there are still things that I need to do on a pretty regular basis that the iPad doesn't that I need to keep a laptop around for big ones no file ecosystem so if I'm photo editing and I want to bring other files in it's kind of incredibly annoying like this thing needs I'm a YouTuber I want to be able to go to the YouTube for desktop site and then go into the YouTube studio and go through Analytics play Studio features that way mobile Safari will not let me it kicks me out into the YouTube app every single time same with Google drive there is a Drive app but I want the desktop app with all the desktop features and the desktop UI and I can't do that in the default browser there's no trackpad or and it won't do anything and then the USB C Port you'd think would Rock a world of possibilities of connecting all kinds of accessories and being able to talk to them through the iPad first of all Thunderbolt accessories don't work only USB type-c does so you can plug in a display for example but this is something you could already do with lightning and still all it will do is mirror the display but now it's up to 5K so the closest I can get to my ideal scenario at least with creative stuff on the iPad Pro is photo editing actually so my camera of choice is a Hasselblad x1d it has a USB type-c port so when I plug it in to the iPad play USBC to SD card adapter I plug that in then I get to import the file it goes into photos I can bring that into Lightroom and then I can do all my edits with the raw file and editing on the iPad Pro is easily my favorite way of editing photos with the pencil with the awesome 12 where's display it's great but that's exactly what I could do with the lightning Port before in fact there's virtually nothing really new that I can do with the USB C port on the iPad Pro that I couldn't already do with a lightning adapter all I'm doing is getting rid of dongles and I love that I don't need a $40 lightning dongle anymore but thanks to iOS it doesn't mean as much now as I think it could so basically this iPad Pro the hardware like I've said it's crazy it's great it's better than a lot of laptops it's better than Apple's cheapest laptops actually but it's definitely still an iPad it does all the same things that the previous iPad just better and that is like a textbook like great thing to say about a product it's it's all better than what it did last year but like conversation of or at least what apple trees to do if comparing it to laptops over and over again puts it in a weird space and I've seen people who's creative workflows happen to fit this iPad Pro into the puzzle of what they do perfectly and I'm so jealous of those people sketch for hours on the iPad Pro who are DJs on the iPad Pro who are doing video editing on the iPad Pro and if does meet your needs for that then this is an incredible and incredible iPad this all has me thinking about two things maybe iOS 13 when that comes out will really turn the iPad into its its true form its final form it'll unlock the USB C port to do when is Apple going to start putting their incredibly powerful chips in Max like in the new Macbook Air which is running in slightly underpowered Intel maybe that's coming in the future sometime soon maybe but until then this is just the play sniper ever thanks for watching talk to the next one piece
