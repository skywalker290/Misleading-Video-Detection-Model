is the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and absolute unit this is that Android phone again that starts at 10 bucks this year I'm making headlines again it's a very expensive phone I've been using it since it came out since that Impressions video so for well over a week and I got play I think it's worth it so last year I was talking about the five pillars of a great smartphone so if you're calling my previous reviews I've had about colors of a great smartphone those five and the one that the Note 8 didn't have was great battery but literally everything tell us about it was great and it's still one phone of the Year this year the note 9 upgrades literally everything about that phone and makes the biggest Improvement to the battery so it's getting a lot of flack for being just an incremental upgrade to the Note 8 but actually think that's one of the best compliments that you could give a phone right now so what are those pillars again you might be asking they are great display build quality great performance great camera and great battery life I always say if you check every single box you got yourself a great quality my phone if we look at Galaxy Note 9 now it checks every single box and then some so the display is incredible some including me say it's literally the best display in any phone last year's note was already the best display in any phone this year it's 0.1 inches bigger and and it's magnificently bright you can read it outdoors and direct sunlight it's super vibrant and contrasting color accurate this is 8 + display great for gaming for watching videos and also no notch in case you forgot about that the only add to a display like this is how big it makes the phone feel I just came from the OnePlus 6 as you know with the smaller display and the pixel before that and using an iPhone 10 a lot so moving up to this note it's one of the few phones that really makes me work hard to use it with one hand and I prefer how often do you use with two hands and I don't say that about a lot of phones so there's a lot of reaching to get up to the top of the display and then back down to the bottom and you're going to not but then again if you're getting a note you already know what you're getting yourself into and sometimes that's just something you got to calibrate for but on all great display no and that gets a thumbs up and that kind of leaves me into the second part which is great build quality with the Infiniti display the kind of bleeding of the edge it's recognizable versus other phones that don't do this and I liked it it they don't have to reinvent the wheel here they found something makes it feel really immersive and they just keep doing that well but really I think we just keep forgetting like the build quality the industrial design or just generally the hardware of this phone is one of the most underrated things about it it's really great give the premium build materials right so you got metal all the way sound this is the new blue one that I actually kind of like a lot tight Corners like really boxy as a phone much more squared off than most but do you like that they still have the rounded corners of the display but not by a whole lot and then overall it just has this chiseled dense look and feel and that's a lot of boxes it's ip68 water resistant it has a headphone jack it has excellent clicky buttons and I'll talk more about those in a bit and one of the more underrated upgrades to the hardware is the speakers they're in the same places they were but they're now much louder and Fuller sounding straight up better than before I definitely appreciate that slide downside to the hardware is the glossy back that will 100% 5 tons of fingerprints as you can see as good as Samsung's glass looks when it's clean it can get pretty clouded up but obviously the easy fix you can play dbrand skin on it I may recommend a black skin specifically for this one so you can rock a super clean black and yellow look with that build quality is not a problem on the note 9 I even say it technically counts as reader down just a little bit to be more reachable Minor Detail but makes a difference when you're using it everyday but low quality is great okay so performance Galaxy Note 9 has been a great performer it's a fast high-end Flagship so you'd expect that snap 45 and 6 gigs of RAM here etcetera I'm always worried about Samsung skin though because it's not light it's kind of a lot tell me about software updates with it but from my youth so far it's been smooth and snappy it's what I've come to expect and it's gotten one software update now this is 128 gig version with 6 G I haven't gotten to try myself the 512 GB version with is a ram but the thing about that first of all it's 250 bucks more expensive than the Baseline version so that's a lot and then I don't really stop actually using 500 gigs of storage on a phone as amazing as it is I love that it's an option is 2018 but tell us all the stuff I use as far as media music photos this stuff is all cloud-based anyway if you are the type of person to have an in what kind of local media and movies and games whatever it is you're doing there can only be one phone that's offering this half a terabyte of storage right now I mean maybe two or three but that's what note is all about giving you these power user features plus an extra 2 gigs of RAM doesn't hurt but I pretty much anyone including me will be fine with the 1286 and there is also a new cooling system to mention so Zach Jared everything he tore into note 9 and showed the much bigger copper heat pipe inside this phone Samsung calls it a water carbon cooling system all I can tell you is just from using it this phone definitely still gets a little bit warm on the back especially when gaming for a while or navigating in a warm window of your order something like that but definitely never overheated it is for sure a great gaming phone though it has the specs and more to keep up and the most incredible display and some upgraded speakers so that's still a solid combo and so then there is the camera or cameras and this this is a firmly third place camera as far as smartphones go right now which is pretty awesome I mean you got pixel 2 at the top which is amazing then you got list an iPhone 10 right around 2nd and 3rd you can watch the blind test video If you don't believe me but this is essentially the exact same camera setup as the Galaxy S9 bus from a couple months ago which makes it an upgrade from the last note so just like the S9 plus you give it a lot of light and it is excellent camera you can get real shallow depth of field if you get close enough to your subject as they're pretty classic Samsung Vibrant colors and over-processing as far as sharpening and noise reduction you've already heard this all for me before the one New Edition is the AI in the which they call a scene Optimizer that will automatically adjust certain colors when it recognizes the subject so with flowers that might boost what color is it with Landscapes it might boost the blue of the sky but I found this more inconsistent and annoying to me than useful I turned it off after a while but what I do think was useful is what they called flaw detection or basically if someone blinks or the photos blurry or find a red eye or something's messed up in some way it'll let you know right away so you can take another one that part is cool but overall yeah so Galaxy Note 8 had great camera then Galaxy S9 and S9 plus had great camera now we got no 9 still great camera so that brings us to what you were all probably wondering about from the beginning which is the battery the note 9 bumps up to a 4000 Play Empire battery which is a pretty big jump from last year last year they were a little conservative you know sort of following up on the heels of the problems they had so they had a 300 milliamp hour battery in Note 8 so that's a plus 20% battery capacity size that's not I know a lot of things we've said about this phone have been iterative that's not that is a massive jump but that's just on paper so as far as actual life of the phone goes it's not the best battery life of any phone that that will still go to phones with smaller screens but note 9 is now comfortably lasting all day with a little play room to spare which it didn't do that before so I'm getting around 5 hours of screen on time with most of my days occasionally a little more never really which with my heavy usage is pretty damn good I'm going to say a minus grade battery that I was pretty happy with obviously having a massive 6.4 inch super bright display cranked on all the time is going to take a toll on a phone so we felt that last year with the big I think 4,000 milliamp hours is actually the appropriate battery size for the Galaxy Note and I don't think anyone getting it will be disappointed this is make battery life so looks like they did it they like I said literally upgraded everything on paper about this phone from last year which bigger brighter display it's great you got a great performance you got great build quality you got a great battery life and play camera now all in one song and like the note always does also has a ton of extras just because Samsung has tons of features to throw in for people who are into that Stop Those are people who are buying the note like all the different screen modes in advanced tinkering Samsung throws in the settings for people who want to dial in the exact color balance and play this place things like that it's not it's clearly not Flawless such a perfectly placed Bixby button that can't be remapped I can't ignore that it's a damn shame I just want to remap the Bixby button to launch Google or Twitter or something else I want to do what you can't Samsung I thought you were about that and the S Pen remote feature it works and it's great I just don't see myself using it all that much I don't do thanks for my phone or any presentations or stuff like that so I still just use the S Pen for just taking it out jotting down a note and putting play you know the extra features are welcome and there will be people who love them and use them a lot but it turns out I'm just one of those people who use a stylus the way I always have but for me the end of the day honestly I would have no problem using this phone every single day it checks so many boxes you can't really find another phone does incredible high resolution display no Notch ip68 water resistance a headphone jack and what's a half a terabyte of flash storage Snapdragon 845 8 gigs of RAM expandable storage on top of that dual cameras both no I ask and 4,000 milliamp hour battery 1000 bucks is a lot to spend on a phone but if you're going to spend a thousand bucks on one this is for sure the one to get you're getting your money's worth and people who are looking into buying a note already know what they're getting themselves into and they're going to love this but if you're in the other how do I camp if you're not a note person if you're if you're already typing in the comments a thousand bucks is way too much to spend on a phone I would never do that then a what's the Galaxy S9 or S9 plus which are several hundred dollars less that's going to be the route for you to go so Samsung's kind of offering the whole list of different budget options and you can choose and I think you'll find something you like in there it's a good phone good job Samsung the next one thanks for watching talk to you guys later peace
