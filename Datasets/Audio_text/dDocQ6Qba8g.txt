it might be the most exciting unboxing video ever I don't know you saw the brand on the top caviar Russia and you know look at some wild devices from them in the past at least wild customizations of familiar devices this one goes deeper let's get into it so look at the box look at the leather look at the gold and the Shimmer this type of box you will put a fine piece of jewelry in will display proudly on your where would you put it with you how many videos how long is it how many that right there is the most rare device I've ever featured I'm going to lift that up you examine it you start to notice China looks like an iPhone 11 Pro but you start to look a little closer and you ask some questions don't you will and you see a little signature on Steven Paul jobs Steven Jobs signature right there it says iPhone 11 Pro above their customized by caviar and look at this right over here model number one of nine missing the universe you get caught in a regular iPhone 11 Pro because the camera unit is sort of recessed and then you start to say Okay so order me this Apple logo which is meant to be see-through as it is you see some texture you see a little bit of fabric in there that fabric ladies and gentlemen comes from of Steve Jobs very own famous black turtlenecks what will he do what how did you put it together it's the most intimate iPhone of all time from the mine from the imagination individual who imagined this device in the first place in this format right here look at that shout out the original iPhone that's right we had to give you a comparison I'm going to be unboxing that in a moment cuz this is where it all started you have engraving over here in the side limit addition number one of nine caviar luxury phones up top the other side here caviar luxury standard got the 11 Proctor and the crown for the brand so is this whole titanium wheel is that how it goes this is a slab of titanium on the back it's incredible paperwork let's check out what they're saying about this particular thing this is the international warranty as you can see the caviar iPhone 11 Pro Superior jobs 256 number one of nine what looks like certificate number one international certificate of ownership caviar iPhone 11 Pro Superior jobs 6 1/9 Harding titanium got the serial number the IMEI and of course the design signature the date and the official sticker from caviar this next one international state of authenticity with this certificate we confirm the authenticity of the use of the exclusive material in the limited edition rent it in the modified accessory this specimen oh here we go well yeah there's a specimen in this unboxing this specimen is a Swatch of fabric from a black turtleneck owned by Steve Jobs one of the earliest examples of what would eventually become Steve's trademark style early example this Terr was Warren by Steve at the 1991 PC Forum Gathering the turtleneck was sold by his personal assistant and purchased at a public auction circulation nine copy you want to verify we're having a Tomb Raider kind of moment the tech version of it feels like a treasure sort of do Croft so we also have a booklet of the variety of devices available from caviar there's also a three-piece limited edition called Superior Ali and Frazier from the set a war in their famous match obviously so you have the red one being Muhammad Ali and the blue piece of fabric coming I'm Joe Frazier and that's outlined on each side of this kind of Medallion encrusted right into the iPhone Limited kitchen one piece this has some fabric from various items that the Beatles were wearing of course every single represented John Paul George and Ringo and coming up in the superior collection we have Michael Jackson Elvis Presley Marilyn Monroe well to me they all pale in comparison to the Steve Jobs this one has the connection to the device itself to the to the origin of this device existed analyzing the certificate of authenticity they seem to have an actual computer company when he was ousted from Apple also in a package of course we're going to have a charger we've got special box yes of course for for your earpods we have our lightning cable in the other box we should probably discuss just how this device is it starts at 6 so it is no joke it's just got a cool Factor above and beyond simply coding something in gold or putting jewels on it it's worth bring to just a standard iPhone 11 Pro in 2019 it kind of gives you an idea of how fat the iPhone 11 Pro be without having the camera module pop out it elevates it ever so slightly around the triple camera setup and compared to some of the other stuff they've sent us in the past and this one is actually quite usable you know what I mean will it's still kind of looks mostly like a typical iPhone even though your camera is no longer protruding the Apple logo now is in order to create the space necessary to embed the actual fabric what about the black material on the bottom it's actually call titanium this is black and titanium on the bottom and more typical Titanium on the top we have a very special item here that I thought will be cool to bring into this particular video to just bring it full circle and so we've got one here in the Box this is actually courtesy of another YouTuber canoopsy so shout out to him for hooking us up with this inbox good condition original iPhone so inside the package look at that little guy my goodness the original iPhone which buy today it almost seems like a toy by today's standards look at of course before the age of aggressive screen to body ratios you had a forehead you had a chin Assistant gave you the capacitive touch screen and changed everything man I was there right before that we had resistive stuff I had Palm devices with resistive touch and then the zoom pinch the song was another moment like that some volume switches on the side of once you have your whole switch up at the top yes there was a dedicated headphone jack and look how recessed it is if you wanted to use higher end over ear headphones that had a big connector you would also need an adapter for that because of how recessed the headphone jack you had your sim card tray your power switch in that strange location by today's standards a tiny little Hammer unit up in the corner as well it got the whole ball rolling I never even mentioned the fact that this thing completely changed photography as well so many things were not documented in the way that they are today now obviously as you examine the design here you can see the inspiration for the Steve Jobs special edition iPhone 11 Pro the major takeaway is just how different the scale is you used to notice a visual difference between where the screen lived and where the glass that covered it now everything is laminated it feels like you're touching the actual icons so your digitizer would be separate from the glass Britt from the LCD and in many cases when people would crack the glass you could just replace that component instead of the whole thing that's scroll back to the old days when I was replacing screens on these things original iPhone unboxing we of course had how do you pin connector which does everybody remember that this of course a holdover from iPod days if you had any dust food particles you know how they would get in the pool we moved on this is kind of crazy they also included a dog they put a light out for audio so you can have this near your stereo or some speakers or something like that I did actually and you would have it dark like this I mean original headset which these are not pods they were not called pods earpods instead they looked a lot more like a standard headset they just happened to be in white and that on his turn off to disrupt the audio the portable audio industry cuz prior to this all the Sony walkmans and everything else it was black headsets there you have it once again one of the most special interesting items I've ever featured on the show in the middle all together to commemorate Steve Jobs obviously The Mastermind behind this product and in many ways behind obviously Apple it's not meant to be mass-market that's why it's limited to nine devices but I think it's very cool and only has some sort of Museum quality to it
