all right very exciting Willie do he's got a special package today he pulled some strings would you look at this oh my goodness Galaxy f o l d i mean this is highly anticipated honest this is the one people have been waiting for I've been waiting for myself I talked about this thing a lot and now it's here it's in front of me this is a whole this is in a completely different direction the Slender phone and then the flip out scenario into an almost like experience how's it going to work how's it going to function I don't know what better way to find out than to jump in the Box get Amazon experience slide this out here we go it's the box in the Box there's a number of combinations you can get this one in front of me over with space silver hinge okay it's got the Galaxy buds inside okay we got the Galaxy buds now this device feature the Wireless charge sharing you'll be able to drop this guy onto the Galaxy fold and charge this play from the device the fast charge power brick type-c cable to keep it charged up and the interchangeable ear tips for those Galaxy buds that I mention now also in here there is this little adapter that's for transferring your data over to the this of course is the full-fledged Galaxy fold right there that's wild real quick what Jack you never that's your phone or it's your tablet what we're talking here about you're not folding displays you can see on the front here two forward facing cameras we flip it around to the back you see a triple set up in this location so we got a wide ultra-wide and telephoto this is already such an unusual experience first Glimpse actually at the keyboard and you see you get this split layout there's a lot of different ways to unlock this device face recognition fingerprint pattern pin password let's give the fingerprint a go here fingerprint scanner right there Jack it's a side-mounted scanner reminiscent of the Galaxy s10e scan in my print all right I think we're in it's booted up this is your that's what you're looking at their you can see the the butterfly wings or Wings do they flap they fold so does the device of course close it up so this is a 4.6 inch display it has nothing to do with the inside display this is a supplementary display on the it's 7:20 by 1680 now this is going to be useful of course for quick interactions phone calls how long these lines you just need to pop this up to your face and it's very slender actually I mean it's got weight to it as you'd expect components at Play It's really interesting now there must be some kind of magnet at the close it sits there let's say I've got YouTube open and now I'm like all right I need a bigger display to navigate YouTube I want to watch some videos you just flip this open and it's quick you're scrolling around you're looking for a video to watch you actually get into a video let's say click on this video playing here 2152 by 1536 at 7.3 is it's like a small tablet experience to transition into a real immersive video you just flip it open these devices have become such major consumption devices for us you saw screens scale up over time on smartphones back in the day when you original note inevitably people did now it's common place to see somebody sitting on the couch with your smartphone sort of cranked up in front of their eyeballs in an uncomfortable position but now when you go all the way to this form factor right here and you're kind of in small tablet territory that entire experience become less uncomfortable like a YouTube session on this thing is a totally different proposition than a YouTube on a smartphone as it currently stands but as far as I can tell I mean this is the biggest video watching experience I think I've ever had on a phone it's super easy to hold like you're holding it like this this is real life now guys this is what it's going to be on the street on the bench in the public transit it's a whole new thing and you're going to notice it from a mile away I think this thing fully engaged to the Syfy Lou right now but what we're looking at is the convergence of these various devices into a singular device can this thing get night where it can legitimately replace the laptop as well this is a real future I'm convinced now keep in mind like we said before close it down it's like closing a laptop it's ready for the pocket and it's Slender and it's real fancy looking this is a double tap to wake stop on the outside like this but then over here to unlock it and then this is your screen and fingerprint to unlock when I'm out on the street I'm out just living life how often do I transition between the two modes I would think I could get by through a lot of scenarios in the clamshell you're surfing the web you know you hit up Twitter you're just it's a whole different thing going on it's definitely expensive we should talk about that 1980 well USD it is a Powerhouse though 12 gigs of ram in this monster Snapdragon 855 just got a 4380 battery I really think it's the future it's crazy to say I didn't know I was going to say it this is some fut the 12 year old me like holy moly man like just when you thought things were getting stagnant that's an actual that's a thing going on now I do need to say it's very important okay I do need to say you see where the display folds over it depends on the background as well I mean videos on this I expected this to be the case and the is I don't care I don't care at all this is Magic ranting and raving aside here it's still got a camera oh my God camera the setup is very similar to the S10 you have the typical wide you have the ultra wide and of course you also have the telephoto here's telephoto first typical wide and in my favorite Ultra wide oh my goodness gracious so that's your ultra-wide image there's your wide and just like you normally would lot to grip onto there so you can see in landscape you can go ultrawide quick standard wide quick telephoto quick and then I can fold it out and I'm still in the camera module interestingly enough the same cannot be said for the front facing cameras because of course we have two units here and a single unit on the outside and we have a selfie a slightly wider image and a slightly closer very nice wow Jack that's the the biggest selfie we've ever analyzed here in a channel that's a contrast so that's a 10-megapixel camera now on the inside you have the two camera modules there you have play megapixel and an 8 megapixel and we'll try these ones out as well we'll see if we get any different so performance I'd say a Sim on the outside camera and the inside camera now what about the speakers so first I guess we'll test it for dialogue play typical YouTube video and as well as on the other side over here so legit stereo sound like let's try some music real quick it's got a crispy sound it's detailed and you got sound at the left and right side you actually have stereo separation which is which is so unusual in the smartphone space I mean that's really impressive I'm happy with that what can we really say about it come into this thing you want to be skeptical it's your job to be skeptical and of course I can find a way to do that because of the price you're very expensive it's almost two grand and I realize not everybody's going to be able to to splurge and spend two G's what you want to frame it a little bit differently you can say what if that individual is in the market for a tablet and a phone I got to say just as a no I mean it's so refreshing to look at something that's so different a completely different take on something that you're so used to and then Apartments where it just has to be a phone first and foremost it's kind of like a repackaged S10 which I mean do you know one of the best phones out there you guys are watching a videos to know it's coming through right the excitement level is coming through or it's not and and this is legit this is the real thing all right let's look at the other colors oh my goodness gracious this is bananas oh my that is the blue which kind of has like a cool purplish Hue to it with the this one is gold on gold or is that green that's an emerald kind of green greenish gold with green Martian green okay that's Martian sing with the silver hinge Astro Blue with the silver hinge dark silver oh my goodness gracious kind of like sing the interior of a luxury car you don't just pick the color anymore you pick the color you pick the hinge what time to be alive ladies and gentlemen are smartphones are folding now like just stop and think about the engineering involved all the people involved when you start to imagine then the appreciation comes in that ultimately we get to experience stuff like this because all those people going after that ambition that's always been exciting and its products like this that bring me back to that exists and it's the reason that it started that's the Samsung Galaxy fold
