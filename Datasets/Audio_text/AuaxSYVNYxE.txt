hello and welcome to NDTV on my name is actor Aamir Khan who we get Once in a few years nowadays I'm very welcome to any TV was the time we used to interview you once in a couple and then came a time where interviews didn't happen for a couple of years then came a time where it used to happen once in a year and now this is a time it happened once in a couple of years my question is is it going to be this erratic or do you think we can expect you to see life is quite erratic and you know so when I'm shooting a film then everything goes soft focused I'm not in a frame of mind to communicate and that I don't give them time at that time to Japan talk to you guys but to focus on just my work and it's something I enjoy doing it sucks me in I get lost in the world that's great as long as you keep making entertaining films nobody's complaining you work with so many directors who are you know sometimes they are first time Direct sometimes they are not directors who would have necessarily given a hit just before your film how do you scripts we know how you choose how do you spell directors because how do you know that or someone will be able to pull off this film actually you know use the tools of Cinema to tell a story if I test that then if the person is already made a film I've seen the film I can you know understand what I usually do as a producer is I request them to shoot 5/16 of the film shooting edited and show it to me so like we do a screen test for an actor I do a screen test for the director okay just to make sure that the person is to communicate and read what he set out to write so that is the easy part the more difficult part is actually what is very important for me is that there is a story within him or her which is dying to come out and the desire to reach out that desire to communicate are you feeling alright you cannot test that you either feel that or you don't feel that so for me that's very important that the director should have the fire add Deli to tell that story and I think that all the directors have worked with one of the big reasons that they've come out with such good work is that they had a story to tell that is making love on mehra making basanti Farhan making this is something it is that intangible something that excites me about working with the director nice value of production house will you as a producer making friends with a social message or you would someday make a film like andaz Apna what's the weather in one fixed genre different genres excitement yeah and in fact I'm not even looking for a message when I'm reading a script that is the last thing on my mind just you know how much does it suck me into the world I just react like an audience kiyoshi is not coming for a passion on sociology they want to have a good time and I want to give them a good time so that's what I'm looking for a good time what is a lot of humor and fun and all of that so it's a very entertaining something very important so I feel that me engaging in audiences number one put a child who has dreams she has the talent and her father is against it this was a problem in our country many years ago this problem event today what do you think should we done to empower children like this you have done so many friends I can name your friends this problem will of course you will keep telling stories its how do you think this problem will get away with this is contributing positively to that so whether it's the things I think each film that you mentioned has had a deep impact that is had a huge impact so you know so has three idiots we have moved forward as a society and I hope that that process continue to remember that it's a large country is we are also very young country we've just had Independence in 47 is being what 70 years older adults so it's it's a process right it's a process and I think that we are moving in the certainly we have a long way to go straight yeah but we have come a long way there have been big changes and and I hope that I need to move in the right direction and things like this feels like the stories like this you know will help that process he's in the promo you might have seen that line where I tell zaira I had forgotten that I had said this actually in real life to somebody and it was I was telling me that please tell my son to study hard he doesn't study I want him to study she just told him to watch a movie Aamir Khan please send questions the most one question what people want to know is is your character based on Anu Malik everybody wanted to know well no it's not actually it's not based on any one person all right who you think is beautiful I haven't been to anyone but you pick something from a lot of people talk about when even when we interviewed all the stars that was the discussion was whose number one who's number one you have moved away from discussion completely you have now you have new markets your friends do well in Hong Kong and China was there a strategy somewhere that you said this is how I go about blow my heart I like to I have no idea that I would become so popular in China on my work would be appreciated I had no idea and it was not planned it was not I did nothing to make that happen play like my work and I'm so grateful for that that they went around doing it it was on the internet that they saw 3 Idiots Are You released

audience that's the audience that I've been making films for and it gives me a lot of joy the globe who have liked my work and have appreciated the work and it makes me so happy to know that you know
