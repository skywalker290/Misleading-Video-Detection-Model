Forefront how decision send dishonest celebrities really are people who the masses look up to and are highly influenced by Cobra pose to hidden cameras and held meetings pronounce celebrities in understanding whether these popular individuals can support a narrative post about it like it was their own view with a huge ring on multiple social media platforms like Twitter Facebook and Instagram just for money so basically an understanding weather for a price celebr he's with millions of followers will post something political a statement supporting a particular political party before the 2019 elections if they don't believe in their vision and ideology for money here's just telling you some of the celebrities who were called red-handed willing to sell their soul for money can you add White scary as it clearly tells us that we shouldn't believe what we see even if it seems genuine from these Bollywood Heroes and heroines Amisha Patel the actor that has lost her relevance in recent years and Bailey is getting to feature in films as a lead her last Venture being the cringe-worthy agreed to post political facts and movement supporting a narrative for a price saying that she is well connected with social is because she once posted about atal bihari vajpayee is passing away today if that wasn't cringey enough the actor just had to make sure key statement was Vivek oberoi imagine Peter that everyone loved and adored the actor who was ostracized by the industry because he took panga with the wrong man who is going to feature in possibly the political propaganda film is ready to post about certain political aspects that he himself doesn't fully believe in a man who is ready to influence the Millions followers he has a multiple platforms to know about the great workings of a political party just for the money the man is ready to push an additive and most oberoi feel social media may be acting as you need to hear it's sad to see your favorite Stars being so desperate to make money like this Pisgah Chopra I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw one of my favorite and underrated actors agreed to take part in a campaign that would stay do you believe she thinks in a particular political way just for money in the meeting was very keen on taking up the contract and also made sure that she's do these days representatives of a crisis management company that her base price is much more than they are offering mahima Chaudhary a beautiful actress that was extremely popular in the late 90s and early 2000s did not even turn on the standing that the individuals just want the celebrity to tweet post on Facebook and Instagram about great aspects of the BJP and the many of the where's that have been passed by the current ruling party on being asked what would be the price at which Audrey would be willing to say anything to her fans even if she do you believe in it was quite Ludacris and delusional ready to sell your thoughts and steel fans for any good amount kailash kher one of the funniest instances in these multiple sting operations when kailash kher was found to be say yes to a contract by opposing PR Company for BJP keeping in mind the 2019 elections ahead where the kailash kher can basically do advertising for BJP behind closed doors under the table even if he doesn't believe in the ideology or performance of the party the singer made it very clear Jack Apna video It's just sad how I feel most of us would want to believe in a celebrity Post in their personal pages and it's nuclear that it is not a paid promotion responsive post that it is generally coming from their heart but nope in many instances you should just be Khan they might be just telling you something that they've been paid to say Shakti Kapoor sting operations and Shakti Kapoor were not already synonymous with each other Singapore seems to be a big fan of anything shady that seems to be happening behind closed doors very confidently agreeing to the campaign of getting paid to play political party without naming it or any names of politicians or even mentioning play it is a paid promotion because of course that is that shady as it gets getting to know that a party paid and acted to promote its work but Shakti Kapoor and we are best friends now celebrities and their opinions for sale at any price what's 687 play Sonu sood an actor that gets active work in the industry is doing financially well with multiple office scheduled ahead yet was ready to take part Shady practice of promoting the successful projects leaning towards one political party and that no one should get to know Julian actions or do your voice then the job is racism props definitely have to go to actors like I said wasi Vidya Balan soumya Tandon Raza Murad
