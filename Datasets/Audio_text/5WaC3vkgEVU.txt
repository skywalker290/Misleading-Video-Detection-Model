Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci aims to shed light on some of the most problematic sequences from Indian cinema this is only restricted to define the laws of physics and basic logic but also aims at showing you the double standard of what is considered to be socially except the blatant ignorance and insensitivity towards Beauty norms and race and how their has been years of the same problem being propagated through shocking Indian movie dialogues of scenes you won't believe that released in 1997 cuqui play Volta starring Govinda and sushmita Sen to creative Liberties of pushing the limits both logically and socially the movie which Focus Raj Malhotra played by Govinda a lawyer who is a gold digger and a compulsive liar at 1:55 Bollywood anyway had a tendency to push the limits of what was acceptable in a court of law where in God of Salman Khan literally starts a royal by breaking the witness stand and starts a no holds bar doubly match many films like Raja Ki aayegi baraat would force women victims of abuse to marry that abuses in order for them to mend their ways going by the same history of Bollywood and absolutely no log when Raj Malhotra is character in the film feels cornered as if there is no way for this criminal client to go scot-free he questions old man who was an eyewitness to the crime keeping in mind this statement what the lawyer find suitable in court yes in court to call the old man on the light is this at least Norfolk Lumberton I digress that's not even the point the main point is Kissimmee lawyers in other words contempt Raj Malhotra dulhan hum Le jayenge well it's become quite clear that the matl play series more than just being an Indian movie analysis episode is turning into a David Dhawan special another film that is an exaggerated Karishma Kapoor put in the process has to impress her three uncles who have raised her all three uncles being exaggerated caricatures anupam character decides that he will choose who marries his knees his brother what is the smartest phone number where is instructed to amp up his mannerisms to seep into the subconscious of the Indian masses who are already homophobic not know intentions starts dancing with them when they start harassing her Salman Khan approaches the situation and does this what follows is a nationality debate which is mind-numbingly painful to listen to she asked for it more outline the static dampens the otherwise immersive and engaging experience you are throughout the running minutes if you remember the long drawn-out sequence leaving the baby in Mausam or the entire sequence of Shahrukh Khan zero prepping for the NASA Mission it unnecessarily stretches the film and lessons light impact lingaa was a rajinikanth film that was under in many aspects a lot of critics praise the magnetic presence of the legend can you get the demerits of the film to be in its writing the 2 hours and 58 minute long film has one of the most illogical final how much is I have seen in Indian movie history the villain kidnaps the heroine and has a plan to escape in a hot air balloon to Sri Lanka and presumably a nitrogen bomb at the dam by tying it to the heroin then we see rajinikanth chasing the hot air balloon has he drives a motorbike with a jarring green screen behind him he perfectly lifts off with his bite to land on top of the hot air ball and fight with the the combat sequence leads to the villain falling off the hot air balloon the heroine holding on for dear life hero rescuing her ocean we all forgot about the bomb that is going to blow up the damn right well don't worry about it play Hero has to do is be Cristiano Ronaldo for a second and bicycle kick that thing in the water for everyone safety I wonder being a bootleg version of play Escape from corner to instances from this phone just rub me the wrong way first of all there is a song called Vallejo ladki that has a music band in the background that is covered in black paint it's not a musical group of African descent these are Indian dances that have been good with black paint on their face and then the song chorus goes Gori Gori Gori Gori then you're like oh wow is the purpose of just to create contrast to the lyrics then there's a dream sequence song called o rabba where Sanjay dutt imagine getting married to Manisha as a gag they get an African girl everyone is shocked only for koirala to appear from the background do you like and then you wonder why Indians are obsessed with fair skin and illuminated against people with darker skin tones you perpetuated it badrinath Ki dulhania a movie I don't understand how I could social issues that are deeply disturbing to show in a commercial movie context especially the fact that it released in 17 what's the Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt started badrinath Ki dulhania from a character standpoint badri played by Varun Dhawan just doesn't want to not the way his brother did in an unhappy marriage that was forced upon him and abides by whatever his father says AKA women don't work marriage or the Hedge because since God the approach of the hero towards the otherwise not interested in extremely driven hero is what we blame old Hindi Cinema of doing all the time stalking bus Jolla College badri AJ foreseeable future living in the shackles of that play she lives in at the altar for badri she is dead but because the villainess and regressive father has said you have a chocolate PE goes all the way to Singapore and the very first point of contact in his car trunk to prove a point that he has been nothing but kind to her he says many coffee tomorrow it blows my mind that it took me only to Revis play to identify how problematic it was and that was a video guys right down in the comments below whether you have
