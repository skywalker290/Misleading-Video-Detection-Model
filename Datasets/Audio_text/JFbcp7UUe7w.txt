his exercise is a funnier than mine are funny things like what play all the animal movements and all you know set volume to 10 minutes of Happiness hi it's so nice to see you so nice to see you look so cute thank you and you obviously like always hair makeup on point I miss I miss my Glam team so much I miss my team so much I can order for me play like doing my makeup and stuff like that but like for like fun like before work to do it you know you you realize add getting ready for work is very different from getting ready to go out for fun but your what team is the maddest team I have ever seen with you see the video that they did for me for my birthday it was the sweetest thing yeah it was so sweet it was the best thing ever I think it's gone viral video ever since I've known you you have not seen one city more than 10-15 data districts I know you like you know you're always saying in the last 2 years you're living across three cities how is it to be in one in Delhi for more than 2 months every time I spend a lot of time with my in-laws I'll spend a lot of time with my brother-in-law who you know we have not because I'm in and I don't believe in between we don't get to spend that kind of time and like one city and one goes so that was amazing tell me some you and your mother-in-law what all did you do so my mom-in-law is basically one of the most cool women you have a come across and she dresses beautifully now but both of us were like during we are not going to be dressed in pajamas and workout clothes we love so we were everyday like obviously we work out and we would like to bake together we love baking together and making desserts and like Khana and whatever but then I would always get excited about dressing up so we would dress like actually I haven't stayed in my gym clothes on my pajamas straight for more than 2 or 3 days maybe then charge it and then I'm just like this is I need to get ready you know and you know some you know doing so much laundry is also pain so you rather just I'm going to dress up and how did you discover about each other we are living together and stuff like that and yeah he's not going to work like he's not going to offer but was really nice is that he he does like he comes every 2 hours like from where he's working is usually working in the other room so that I can have my own space like in the living room he's working like every 2 hours he comes to say hi to me and we have lunch together and so we don't actually see each other like we can see each other like people she's outside and sitting in my bedroom but we don't actually see each other that much during the day like he has his work space but we get to spend that extra together like lunch together or breakfast together because usually he likes to get in at work by like 8 a.m. so he's up by 5 he was like from each last night at 1:00 a.m. 8 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. he was working that is true that is crazy tell me if you have to like you're not get back at him and catch him at his weirdest best what would that be okay so he does something called Mobility okay while working out so he crawls on the floor and then he doesn't baby movements because apparently our bodies forget how to like walk and like you know babies are very flexible and they can like whatever whatever I am definitely I also like just like what what his hair had become you know he usually my husband usually likes to completely buzzed his hair and he feels very hot so he's he's like shaves his head and I was like I have a very picture of his with his head is like this is gone this side and I really think you're supposed to get back home picture of TuneIn besura I'm not going to be able to cut album like it was incredible it was so much fun it was crazy I mean my mother is obviously gone completely nuts with this so my sister to order these balloons for me and each and every balloon was like clean with Dettol you know I have seen your family it's a madhouse your dad your sister your brother reality camera add house in little sense tell me the funniest things that are happening in lockdown the funniest human being and lockdown he doesn't care what's happening to anybody he is just worried about hospital games 15 minute I am going to get body massage why do you want muscles so like he has he wakes up at the same time every day he is working like crazy like he's red like we all are reading scripts I mean I think this is the Scripps I received in my life until now every day all the writers are working overtime and sending them inspiration he does doesn't let go like he is like I cannot even explain to you you know I my father has like walked my whole life right I've never seen him not work but you anybody else is getting extra money because of the pandemic I think just my mom and my really scared of my mom so he's just sitting butt talking about it incredible yeah like most actresses do so he loves but I think he could not like he found it hard to wash now because it was it was so hot like not because he didn't like the film but because it was hard for him to watch because I was in there thank you so much for being part of 10 minutes of Happiness thank you thank you for having me that's the only way forward always and always love you love you
