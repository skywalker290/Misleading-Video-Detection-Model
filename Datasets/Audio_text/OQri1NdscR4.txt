Sunny warm much warmer than Beast Hawthorne California and we're out here for the Tesla Model y event and I say we because it's you and I but it's I'm out going to be the fourth in Tesla's S3 they're more higher and then there's the model 3 which are kind of starting to see everywhere especially in the US as a smaller slightly lower price an SUV version of model 3 so this event out this is the big reveal this is where they're finally going to show us the design the specs and the price Lexus is a gigantic camera but I will get to it actually really wish I wish I had a switch podcast some of you may be wondering why model why why model why is even a big deal at all or even if it is rise up what's the best-selling cars over the past couple months that it's been out but the best selling SUVs especially in the US best selling SUVs are constantly way out selling the best-selling cars so I think model y has a potential to be a much Peter seller then even model 3 and so there it is one of the very few Tech products of the past year that didn't leak so this is your first public look at the Tesla Model y so my first reaction to seeing it first rolled up on stage was a Yep looks about right looks like play bigger model 3 little taller but you know from the front angle on stage very familiar very similar and the specs of course are similar so it's going to be $230 me with standard up to 300 Mi range with the long range version and then you can see the acceleration number is pretty modest ask me if you're not getting the performance version but of course the performance one is Zippy at 3.5 seconds 0 to 60 and the price range and release it's going to start at 390% similar to model 3 they're not going to be making that base model cheapest version right off the bat we're going to make the higher end more margin filling models starting in Fall 2020 then the base model at 39000 will come by 2021 also you may have noticed when they got that car up on stage seven people got out of it so Tesla is saying why is a 7 seater with three rows of seats that is something I had to see in person because that's it doesn't look that much bigger than model 3 we got to go outside and see it in person a bit more for ourselves go for a test ride and basically the more angles I see it from the more I see it as basically a hybrid find between the model X and the model 3 it's like the two of them had a baby or something and really it's mostly model 3 since it's sharing Parts with it but with a few differences so one is bigger than model 312 there's an all glass panoramic roof now you looked really cool and seamless but was literally impossible to get footage of tonight 3 the ride height is a little higher and that's on purpose so you sit a little higher in the same seats in this crossover than you would in the model 3 4 I think the front it should be a bit deeper as well that is me speculating they didn't let anyone open the front trunk or rear trunk but it looks like that should be the next and five speaking of trunks the hatchback so it is now an automatic lifting rear liftgate that is great for cargo I love the model es hatchback I've had all four tires in the back of my car the other day so I'm happy to see that that's going to be great for space number six with all that extra space there is a third row option now like we saw singing in person it looks extremely cramped and my gut reaction is I don't recommend it if you need three rows worth of people on the regular get a bigger car like a model like a size because if you do put people on the third row you better hope they're either smaller or much younger because the legroom and seem to be both extremely limited model X has more space of course and number seven something I found really interesting so if you look play the parts where there is normally Chrome on the model 3 so the door handles the window trim the mirror pieces where it's normally really Play Shiny all these pieces on the model y as you can see our sort of a satin matte black color and it turns out that's the way I'm going to be there are no shiny Chrome pieces on this car it's like a factory chrome delete so you don't have to get your car wrapped to get rid of the Chrome anymore so I think that's pretty sweet not a lot of people notice that and that's mainly it so I mean you know I got my 30-second test drive like everyone else who waited it was Pitch Black where did you just almost useless but hey I got to write in it and one of the angles that you actually don't get to see as much in a lot of the videos are going to start to see as the do you have a car like the butt of it to me it kind of looks like a model 3 with the lights but then with the tall shape of the model X but and the interior as far as steering wheel and display and the seats and everything is exactly the same what is the model 3 so basically if you like the model 3 looks you'll like this if you didn't like the model 3 looks then this is going to change your mind or anything but it was pretty brief hopefully we get to spend more time with it soon maybe we can do an auto focus episode daylight sometime that would be sick also bonus I got to spend a hot minute with the 2020 Roadster first time I've ever seen the car in person actually and sweet baby Jesus that car looks incred I wanted to exist so bad right now so many things about it like the carbon fiber in the wheels the rear diffuser beans on the inside the seats the color the arrow the Bodywork everything so hot I really hope it's on time by anyway that's been it guys hope you enjoyed your first look at model why the affordable slightly larger model 3 with play row option and a hatchback liftgate I do I really do think it will sell more than the model 3 because of the utility but only time will tell so tuned for more videos either way thanks for watching catch you guys the next one piece
