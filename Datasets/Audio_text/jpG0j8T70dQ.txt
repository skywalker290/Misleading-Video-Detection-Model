so this is a highly anticipated product in front of me I've actually talked about a previously on the podcast territory the same family as the crazy popular well received over ear headphones Sony put out with a very similar brand name these ones are actually going to active noise cancellation into the earbuds so they're going to aim to give you noise cancelling performance similar to what you would get much larger headphone but if these are anything like the over ear counterpart then this could be 6 hours of battery life plus 18 I believe the package the case that provide you with substantially more battery life than the gear but itself Sony design HD noise cancelling processor q and 1E high performance noise cancellation and high quality audio / dual noise sensor technology captures ambient noise precisely with two microphones and a stable wireless connection USB type c charging that's a major bonus for me 10 minute quick charge gives you 90 minutes play with noise cancelling on the max listening times around 6 hours and then if you turn noise cancelling off that 8 hours plus 32 with the case if you don't need noise cancelling you can see I've got the black model will I believe they come also in a silver that kind of like gold 10 you that's will I have the other ones in this also looks to be a giant touch pad on the side which could be nice this gives you a look right here at that external microphone pick noise figuring things out by default when compared to an airpod this shit isolate sound already better throw noise cancelling internet as well and it should be some pretty severe isolation woo pretty high quality case going on just what is our retail price US dollars 230 bucks which is not crazy actually you can get airpods for less if you don't get the wireless charge 150 bucks something like that so they are more no doubt about it but noise cancelling so the case refining these technologies and competing like crazy in these certain technology pretty much the only point and shoot segments that have incumbent champions and their deepthroating so well done I haven't expectations based on that experience there's an app to connect often times I will not download the app alongside some wireless headphones but in this case it's a must because the is there a crazy the tip selection is cool look at that these are your more typical rub Rise soft Touch feel and then over here these look like a foam possibly a comp it's a nice fit it's a nice fit and a nice presentation there's a magnet that pulls them in and now you get this LED light on the front you have the NFC logo there that to me indicates that you can what's up just by Touch I'm very happy right I'm very impressed I'm having a good time I like the way the package is coming together things are looking good all right so I've got the app open now headphones are blinking blue now adaptive sound troll the app detects your actions and automatically adjust how to take in the ambient sound so this is the coolest part if it that you need isolation based on the surroundings it'll tweak and toggle up the noise it can figure out you're on an airplane and then set up a profile specifically for an airplane cuz they know what an airplane battery life on both the left and unit the adaptive sound control realises I'm in one spot I'm staying so it has the ambient sound control ambient sound speak to you disrupt you the next profile is walking in which the ambient sound goes all the way up to 12 without the focus on automatically if train bus and then the noise cancelling goes to Max Jack that's cool come on Jack you can also go into the is there which allows you to really tune in how you want them to sound depending on type of music you're listening to there's a now playing section whatever it is that you have to be listening to there's an automatic pause when the headphones are taken off there's something called dch I saw that on the bus I didn't know what it was well can you tell me what d c h a wow okay so this is a this is a type of ideal processor that aims to take lower fidelity audio and enhance it I should also mention these have Google assistant boo which is my assistant of choice okay so already I'm feeling pretty significant isol catch a couple tunes real quick look if you want some bass is it feel free you go in there you tweak your toggle you get and volume fullness and when I tapped it right now on the other hand I just got audio feeding through I can hear myself presumably you want to chat good good I can hear you now if switch to Transit please cancelling but it's not as intense as what the over ears are capable of okay say something now now test test these are headphones these are a pair of earphones for you do no the noise cancelling is not as intense as the over ear version but this look at that you travel a lot those people with those airpods out there they're lacking all these features alright they're almost at the same price this material is I got the more foamy thing right now still soft I think I maybe I prefer it I'm going to play around with that a little bit make my my perfect fit but as far as Jim use activity use yeah no problem I don't know play with the equaliser let's see we have a some sort of a rock the over ear model for me cuz I know a lot of people have to make the choice between the two I don't think so that said if I needed to travel 101 size fits all have on a headphone like I said for the bag for a particular clientele for a certain buyer that that One headphone to do it all to be portable to be an earbud to have noise cancelling to have an astronomical number features to have good battery life multiple fits like I just don't even know what else I would recommend exactly in this department
