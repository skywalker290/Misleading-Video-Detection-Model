crawling ignorant about the fact that we haven't done a Matlab kuch bhi episode on the channel if you are new in this space on a monthly basis we do a video dedek play scenes from Bollywood movies that if I signs and logic and also have not aged well with today's social climate but I've been unfair in previous episodes primarily focused on Hindi movies this episode will focus on scenes from several states of the country the scenes will range from challenging the intellectual capacity of Indian audiences to outright being offensive regressive and borderline problematic with its impact on the masses so without further ado try to refuse Productions with shocking Indian movie dialogues or scenes you won't believe were proved Meri biwi Ka jawab nahi the only movie play Akshay Kumar in sridevi opposite each other was the 2004 movie Meri biwi Ka jawab nahi the interesting aspect about this movie is that it was actually short in 1994 and due to production and monetary issues something that was extremely common in the 90s was left incomplete Akshay Kumar play talks about this film stating that this is the only movie that does not have a climax as none of the main actors short for the end sequence it made me interested to see how the creators ended the firm then and talk about the most hotspot of an editor train convince us that actors of present on location the movie is ending with a supporting characters wedding only for the villains to come but the police comes to the rescue to even convince you of the Chris padded they have a shot of random villagers beating up the goons in real play it's just a separate short of extras post this is when none of the main actors including Akshay Kumar sridevi or anupam kher present for shooting all the scenes are short with their back facing the camera and their movements are enacted by Body doubles never do these Main what does the ever faced the camera previous expressions in the film are utilized as reactions to the new dialogues for us to believe that they are present in the green with someone you disappears the funniest is that the main actors had shot for a music video in the film and he just randomly place it in the end do the narrative does alcohol call family drama and he was one of the most valuable directors of the country in the late nineties one thing that has stayed consistent in those family dramas is city of the director towards animals beard animated talking parrots in Kewanee who toffee and hum aapke Hain kaun or in this case Magellan avenging pigeon in Mera Pyar Kiya I don't doubt the capability and intellectual capacity of pigeons but in Maine Pyar Kiya climax in the last thing that I expected was that the pigeon will come saving the day as monish behalf character is going to cut the rope as frame and someone at dang turn on the light the bird comes to the rescue and distracts the antagonist so much so that he slips and is holding on for dear life as he is about to play couple again we noticed the bird getting flashbacks of the trauma that was cost to him by Munich Bell's character and literally kills him play the 90s could do anything and that would undoubtedly be hooting and cheering Matana what is the weather in the 90s because they provided everything that the masses wanted in a Bollywood movie viewing experience in the 90s escapism in the form of what does budget material that was sexist and defied logic in every shape and form in the movie yarana the opening sequence only makes you question the turn off the creators to think that this would be plausible as mother is running away from a creep played by Raj babbar she sees a mannequin and dress up as one while wearing the wig a drunk Rishi Kapoor repairs and is enamored by the mannequin so much so that he purchases it the entire dance sequence with it as he is inebriated so we are to believe that oh he thinks it's still a mannequin by the way she Rishi Kapoor's life but in a normal get up and can't differentiate between the two basically before the lazy disguise of RAB NE bana Di play this movie came just as a side note movies then would portray any artist as either being a feminine what South Indian characters in the most caricaturist way possible one of the most legendary actors of South Indian Cinema featuring in almost all languages of film is Vikram a man who is known for his versatility and the play which he goes in fully imbibing characters but one movie scene from the actors from Morgan Freeman that truly left me Disturbed was the 1996 film first I would like to thank everyone on Instagram who sent me line by line translations of the entire scene I'm so grateful follow me on Instagram by the way Jamie pants for anyway the movie features the actor giving the good news to a woman that he's got a promotion advising her that in this time period She should go to her parents house the woman keeps on refusing Bruce Lee distressed and rather than asking why the man slaps so hard this is when the woman explains that when he had left her for 3 years when Ashley got married she was ridiculed by the villagers as they assumed that the husband had deserted her and the trauma led to her mother's death as well so she I want to go back she would much rather stay alone this is one disturbingly The Scene goes from a zero to 100 and he incessantly what's up with a belt for insinuating that her mother's death might be his fault the woman sustains the trauma and stay subservient to tributes housefull 4 you know the multiplication is primarily focuses on old movies because they weren't created with the sensibilities of today's play climate but when you know that a 2019 movie is going to feature in the series it reaffirms the fact that in many ways we haven't evolved that much one of the biggest hits of 2019 was the fourth installment of household a franchise that gets progressively irritating and some of the other exponentially success the rating of this film really challenged your intelligence as it had this effortless quality of not making you laugh in any frame somehow and it's writing manage to make a rape joke as well pretty girl banda's
