hey what's up guys MK here and welcome to the retail unboxing of the Samsung Galaxy fold so this is an interesting one this is the first foldable phone that's really going on sale to the masses it's priced way higher than even any other high-end Samsung Flagship so it's clearly position does a luxury device and so while you're probably right that most people won't be buying this some people will so it's already on sales pre-order so this is what people paying that $1,980 will get in the Box plus a few bonus Second Impressions so if you haven't already seen my spell First Impressions video boom it's up there on the corner or it's the first link right below that like button so you're about to see a bunch of examples of put on trying really hard to make you feel like your money was well spent so the presentation of the box is you seen within a box is in a box it's awesome it's super extra the thin box on the top is the phone believe it or not but we're going to put that to the side for a second because do you get some other stuff so in this pouch here at the top is a two-piece Kevlar case and a SIM card ejector tool and we'll get back to that in a minute then in this little AKG sleeve here at the top there are a pair of Samsung Galaxy buds so these are the 139 Wireless does that you could consider airpods equivalents in the Samsung or Android World pretty big inclusion here if you ask me and since the Galaxy fold doesn't have turn on Jack this is one step closer to committing to wireless there's no other dongles just straight up wireless headphones then there's also a fast charger and USBC to full size USB dongle in the box and on the other side and those boxes there are more rubber tips for the Galaxy buds and a USBC to usba cable and then that's it for accessories which brings us back to this thin white box from the top just like the other box it says Galaxy but folded so Galaxy fold and inside where's the phone folded flat so that's why it's so thin I don't know exactly why they ship it like this if it's to avoid having a increase from the factory or it's just more dramatic or both or neither I don't know but it ships flat this is the black one and I'll shut always fun putting it up for the first time the setup process is pretty much identical to the Galaxy S10 or any other Samsung phone you sign into your Google account you is your Samsung account you can do this on the front screen or on the inside screen but like I said in the first impressions video that keyboard is what kind of small so I prefer the bigger screen and then by the end of it eventually you end up in the Galaxy fold with stock black butterfly wallpaper with the pitch black pixels around the edges and the middle that is the unboxing experience any case for the Galaxy 4 that anyone makes will either have to be foldable or come in two pieces this seems play smart way to do it it's a two-piece Kevlar sort of flexible material but it avoids that huge hinge and it has no moving Parts it has of course also on the inside that you can line up to attach it but you don't actually have to use the adhesive if you don't want to I found the installation goes on and comes just fine and yeah it gets a little more protected and a little uglier with the case on it kind of like with any other case okay last thing I felt the need to demonstrate in this quick unboxing and Second Impressions is just how solid these magnets are I didn't have a mic at the first imp but now I do have one so that is just super satisfying what phones are back and for good reason so there's a magnet in each side of the Galaxy fold about 2/3 of the way down as demonstrated by this magnet paper my new favorite scientific observation tool and they're pretty strong so they're so strong that they have a bit of a field effectively outside of the phone spell strong enough to pick up metal objects and things like a bunch of washers nails or even whole bags of nails keychains and I even had a small wrench that and an apple pencil which of course is a piece of metal in it for the iPads magnet that worked and a really really big play it's made of metal and I can pick it up this magnet Is For Real so just have to share that a little proof from what I was talking about from the last video again link that below still forming all of my thoughts but man this thing is really distracting me from the P30 Pro I've been using that that review is coming up as well alongside the retrotec episode 1 on the original game boy it's a good time to be a video nerd either way thanks for watching catch you guys on the next one piece
