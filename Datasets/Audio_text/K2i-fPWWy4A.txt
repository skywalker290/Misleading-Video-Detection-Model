Kid Rock was that The Bite of 87 wow Mark did it congratulations Markiplier we finally figured out the 87 yes yes 87713 Bite of 87 was that The Bite of 87 I think so I think it must have been The Bite

and the joke is that they wasted their time making this gift but I couldn't get the oh wait here we go all right it's that's pretty cool when you see an HD version of a popular meme template or how about this one nice weather today you're welcome good returning back again important news God of Legends have been overtaken by flying gorilla in ratings sweet victory at last have a great day and smash next video and suck it rain shadow Legends flying Gorilla game of the year we don't know what's the name of deck but we know game of decade flying gorilla always another news person of the year went to Greater I don't know how to say her name it's very Swedish I don't know how to pronounce stinky language I love this Paul that was from what is that USA Today who should be times 2019 person of the year play Tatu back I will have a couple bonus memes girls I only had 6 hours of sleep I'm so tired boys I get it because I play Minecraft I also like this one because it's true so much Madame meme well done well done and finally meme of the decade Vox the Pinnacle of Journalism what is their idea of meme of the decade where they brought up double rainbow that was a good meme right to have a rainbow yeah sure don't even put that on the list all right meme of the decade has to be something that will go on beyond the decade right don't even bring it up no one says double rainbow Rebecca Black Friday can bling blow my slingshot cute they put Tony it's not even fucking mean you dumbasses Dodge no one uses Dodge not even iron play Slender Man no one hand I get it these are popular memes in their self in their own little encapsulation but they are not I repeat not worthy what the fuck is this on fleek you can die even you can bring up baby Yoda unironically baby Yoda I mean that's lasted what 3 weeks I don't know about you guys but I think baby Yoda has a lot of potential to transpire play last for another decade I think so but when I first saw these memes talking about when normally say baby Yoda should be mean with if I wrote an article on me oh my God the dumb Curry how do you get so stupid this is Pepe the Frog easily one of the most iconic memes and of the decade and has remained relevant ever since uh-huh so he should be meme of the decade makes sense to me I think baby Yoda another argument is for the F to pay respect when everyone is waiting for me with a decade or meme of the year but you made your way into people's language I think that's a pretty fair point right that's what meme of the day it should be something that will go on and live on and is there any more prosper in live greatness but it seems like doggie wind so I don't know what to tell you I don't really care I don't know what to tell you when everyone's fighting over number one meme of the decade but no one is going for second place it's free I'll take I'll take like 5th place if I can when you don't hear your name mentioned for me with the Decker although you ushered in a meme golden age when is harambe volume I refused baby Yoda for meme of decade normies the entire meme Trinity Who's Your Meme of the daycare what do you guys think let me know in the comments down below
