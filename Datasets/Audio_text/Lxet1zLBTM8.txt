oneplus 5t it is literally the 2017 iced version of the oneplus 5 now the oneplus 5 just came out in June of this year so it's only a couple months old and 1 + a company that tends to cater to what their fans want that phone had a lot going for it but it just didn't feel very 2017 with all my phone's coming out but this this now we're talking so in case maybe you looked over the oneplus 5 a couple months ago this is their new one consider this is the top 5 new features of the brand new oneplus 5t so number one is the display and this is definitely play the biggest change literally it's what makes it feel the most like a new phone it's now a 6 in 1080p AMOLED display up front and it gets way answer to every edge so the side bezels are slimmer now and the top and bottom bezels are cut down a lot obviously that's very 2017 you already know screen to body ratio matters now and this feels a lot more modern already because of it now it's still not a quad HD display it's not quite at the level of the flagships in resolution but oneplus also likes to stick with the lower resolution for longer as they have in the name of battery life and and 1080p obviously doesn't look bad at all so I get it also if you haven't noticed it is the new longer taller 2 to aspect ratio we're seeing on all these 2017 phones so this one's 2160 by 1080 it's not new to Android so apps already the display and everything there's no real compatibility problems but still of course it gives you a bit of bezel when watching videos and things like that bottom line is the display is way better it definitely gets really bright so it's available Outdoors and it has different colour modes in the settings including an adjustment slider for colour temperature so they thought of all this stuff that you're probably not going to like this though it is an OLED and why does this weird rainbow wing when you get severely off axis not a huge deal to everyone but I can already see this awkwardly making some head what's the number 2 is 1 + 2 Guns with this design we have definitely seen this industrial unibuddy metal look before there are some and some light curves but overall it's the shape were familiar with it resembles its little brother a lot but there are a couple of changes obviously just nearly edge to edge display of course on the front there's no longer any room for that fingerprint sensor that they've always put up there so this is the first oneplus the correct place on the back which is just above the middle not too high not too low just write about where your finger rest naturally it's still ceramic it's still extremely fast still just as secure but it's on the back now like where it's is the pixel and the v30 and others nice and something else that's usually pretty underrated with smartphones is good buttons in fact we usually don't really bad buttons so I feel the need to mention that the oneplus 5t has exceptionally good really clicky convincing crisp tactile buttons I like that about and another thing 1 + has never officially said that the 5t or the 5 is officially water-resistant or waterproof but I've seen some videos on YouTube where the five holds up pretty well to some minor splashing so that could be a nice bonus to something you usually don't hear about with this industrial design now number three is what 1 + has decided to do with these so the oneplus 5 already had dual cameras it had a main camera and a two times telephoto lens on the
