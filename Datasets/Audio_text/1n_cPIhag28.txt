I hate Twitter I think about deleting mine all the time what I don't like is that constant posturing that goes on there people just can't seem to help themselves from pointing out what is good and what is bad or how others are bad and you are good to a point where it almost becomes fiction just to satis is need and I don't mind that this happens I understand that it does but what annoys me most about it is that it gets rewarded through social Med get likes we get engagement by boasting about certain things it's very popular a classic example could be JK Rowling changing sexual identity retroactively on her characters as a way to Pastor for social virtual points this to me is a good example most understand that it's complete bulshit but it's not always easy to tell what is genuine online contrasting this sing sports as an example previously we have for thousands of years rewarded the winners the people who act the ones run the fastest swim the fastest score the most goals etc etc we don't reward the ones who say they were on the fastest but thanks to social media this is someone become backwards you get rewarded for saying things that make you seem virtuous rather than acting on it obviously this is not nearly to the same extent but it explains why the site has become such a cesspool of opinion and more often than not the people who boast about being virtuous often reveals to be hiding the fact that through action they are not I feel like there's so many what is virtue then and what makes someone actually virtuous well luckily this is answered by ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle according to Aristotle the path that leads to virtue is also the path that leads to happiness or a happy I find it kind of humerus with a never-ending self-help books that exist that still tries to answer this question today when it was answered 2000 years ago by the ancient Greek word you demonia what does this mean keep watching will explore please watch first I just want to say I think it's so fucking cool the more I study ancient Greek philosophy the more I'm just amazed by it first we had is one of the arguably greatest philosopher's of all time who taught using that word loosely by the way Plato my favourite philosopher amazing rider and Plato then created his famous school the Academy which Aristotle then enrolled in and Aristotle has been described the great the one philosopher I mean what a lineage But Wait it goes on Alexander the fucking great it wasn't written by Aristotle it's notes taken down from his lectures by his son Nicky Mackay and some argued this is the most important work of philosophy ever and in it we get the answer what is virtue according to Aristotle virtue is habit what this means is that it can't be taught you can't teach someone how to be a good person or how to act the right way instead it's something that comes through practice one good doesn't make you a virtuous person instead it's something that you have to keep practicing through action and through habit can achieve after reading this find myself looking at my own upbringing and how habit has shaped who I am I never realised just how much of my whole life and my whole being my moral my choices all of this if you strip down this idea of right action through habit you could compare it to machine learning or self-taught AI which actually works similar to how a human brain functions and learns just in a massively simplified way example if a self-taught AI wants to learn how to walk they need a motivating factor for that to happen it could be sing from point a to b in the shortest amount of time and that's the function that they need to maximise when it learns it tries different behaviours no then looking at as humans what is our motivating function what is it that drives us every day to get out of bed and the Answer according to erest is happiness happiness is the root function for all our actions if you make an example out of this you could say what if you want 100,000 what would you do with that amount if you say you want to buy something materialistic like a car you can then ask again well why do you want a car you to get from point a to point B while why do you want to go from 8 to point B you may answer to achieve a certain and why do you want to achieve a certain goal well achieving goals makes you happy similarly if you said well I want to save my money because I hope in the future that will make you happy so then if happiness is our function then why aren't we all happy why is it so difficult well it's complicated and difficult to achieve since virtue is achieved through action and habit helps Us guide us through those actions start a points out that there is an excess and Efficiency to each of our actions he describes his with a couple different examples which I think is kind funny because his goal is to describe what makes someone virtuous but when I read it it just made me think of how many ways you can fail as a human if are you scared of something then you're a coward but if you're too Fearless then you're overconfident Aristotle put a lot of emphasis on communication if you get offended by humor too much then that makes you boring if you make too many jokes then you are seen as unserious if you're too sad pressed if you are not sad enough you might seem cold or unbothered about certain things on how to fail human body points out that between each of these examples their lies the golden mean no not the Golden meme the golden mean hear that the virtuous person acts each time and through habit only can you find this mean in each situation you find yourself in but he also officers on the capacity of each person some of us can only act within a certain frame based on who we are for example Say You hire in a building happen and you run into save someone which is seen as brave and virtuous but if you're not strong enough to act on you could get trapped in the house along with the person and then causing more harm you should therefore understand your capacity to act and then inst call the fire department as a way to help and threw that way you act virtuous within your own capacity this leads us back to the word you dimonia which technically translates to happiness and it's a state of well-being that you achieve by finding the golden mean through right action but what the word really means isn't happiness it's more human flourishing for many of us there exist a gap between what we per self being capable of and what we have actually achieved and this gap creates anxiety for us for some there might even be the opposite situation you are able to achieve more but you just don't recognise it yourself you demonia isn't there for being happy all the time that would just be another stream to the mean but rather is acting virtuous because you enjoy being gracious and it's realising your potential and acting upon it that is the key to happiness that is the key to you ammonia and that is my summary of Nico McCann ethics by the way Twitter
