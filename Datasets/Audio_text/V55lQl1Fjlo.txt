let me start by saying that I don't believe in censorship so I don't judge people for not speaking up I don't judge people for the choices they make if the audience is interested in you that would be interested in you from June was the release of raspberry and there was flashing August beanie in December and now I'm going to be so I'm like I'm loving this when I read a script I never think of what genre is first I read the script for what it is so when I read the script how many good job with with genre is actually I always of course there's a horror element but it's actually a a comedy of errors almost if you if you will and I was not troubled at all because I read the script and I really liked it I think that requires a certain suspension of disbelief and something that's wearing into put order space on the ridiculous space or something that is unbelievable space you always feel very worried my only worry was like dude it shouldn't come off as play NSG right because that's that's what we have to worry about it and I feel like if if you're if your performance and if you're if the way just the way the showers come out if the audience is interested are they interested in what you're doing and what you will do next if if you've got was getting my performance engage you enough for you to be interested in what I'm doing even if you don't believe it yeah I never saw them as those two rules as necessary turn into the human race with a brain and a mouth so I think that having an opinion is is just it's what makes us sleeping here he cannot have an opinion because even if he does he so I don't understand why being an actor and having an opinion or two oppositional things I'm a citizen of this country I pay taxes here what happens in the country affects my work directly now a point where for example like you know what like literally like controversies I think the most amount of corn after Politics the next I should have an opinion as an actor I should have an opinion right so I never saw his oppositional one thing I will say however is that I've never I don't I don't believe in you know bullying other people into having an opinion just because I have one I've always I really so I don't judge people for not speaking up I don't judge people for the choices they make I don't judge people for choosing to stay silent I may not agree with you but okay maybe you have some of this thing but I will say I judge people for break so if you are if you are going to like I mean yeah you can have whatever opinion you have but you don't don't justify murder right don't don't spread hate don't justify murder don't normalize hate I mean all that is not okay so so I I have no problem working with anybody who does but I mean if you have in the past you know if you have like best farm in a way that will harm somebody else especially some other community then I'm not okay with that you don't want to work with someone because you don't want to bring that toxicity in your life let me start by saying that I don't believe in censorship I don't think censorship is a good thing I think that censorship is something that the legacy of sensation India is actually really problematic because those laws were made by the British Indian colonial government to the voice of India during the freedom struggle they didn't want the fact that people were demanding freedom to get out there that's where that Freedom so it's firstly I don't understand why the and I think that this is really it's a very bad it's a very bad sign for a democracy that we are basically in a state where you can #than that so how is this I don't understand this is so Society I mean can we even claim to be can you even claimed to be a progressive model like are we living in 2021 what is happening and we are so petty we've just become so petty as a society I think what is really sad for me when lower the DIA in the film I was like I don't care what it is I'm in it I don't care if I have one line I will come and see it like just to be like cast screen space with someone asked me after 10 years of being in Bollywood I mean I was like I'm done in the process of filming has now become a friend and he's someone I'm I am very fond of but I also really I I find his you know thoughts and I just find him very impressive as so it's a waiting to see when it comes out we missed our International premium because of the pandemic it was to Premiere at the BFI of film festival in London that we missed it had another Premiere in Boston that also we couldn't get to so now we're just looking at whatever is the best way to show have a nice nice opening announcement for it and like a nice release for it
