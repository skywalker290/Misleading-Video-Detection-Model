a few months ago our house was broken into no one was at home at the time when it happened but it was surprising to find out nonetheless what about the breaking got around quickly as news articles covered the event most people were very supportive of course but a few people on the internet play news as a chance to celebrate rationalizing it as since I have wealth and having to replace some items in my home it's just a minor incon play Israeli for once a reaction about me was made completely without my influence another irony is that nothing was stolen from the at least personally even my two most valuable items my camera and computer were left whatever they took was from my wife unfortunately I had previously been decluttering in my house but now I finally shifted to a new gear I got rid of anything I didn't want ton of items that I only can't because I didn't want anyone else to have them or at least take them like Awards all items that had barely any sent bloody things I had stored away never to actually be used if any item lacked value or utility I sold donated or just at the same time I was reading about diogenes the ancient Greek philosopher who only lived with one item in his possession which was wooden Bowl even this he got rid of on the day when he saw a peasant boy drinking water by cupping his hands he tossed the ball play and said fool that I am so I've been carrying this Superfluous baggage all this time there are many stories about diogenes sing too great to be true but I'm glad to know he at least lived you can find him an old paintings which depicts him living in a barrel tub most commonly a large urine if you know about diogenes you most likely already know of his famous encounter with Alexander the Great alexand philosophy and was personally intrigued by him so one day he took out diagenesis who was relaxing on in the morning sun Alexander asked me if there's any favor he could do for him he would do it biogenesis then rewind yes by moving away since you're covering the sun Alexander declared shortly after if I was Alexander then I wish to be diogenes this is such a perfect example of two extremes meeting each other I think the fact that the world Lord who had reached more status wealth and power than anyone in his time could have ever dreamed of still a man who had seemingly nothing coming to this conclusion he must have realized that the things we value actually is little satisfaction on its own and all the things Alexander had that others wanted meant nothing to diagenesis in my own exper what little notoriety and wealth I have is still far greater than anything I could have dreamed of but the experience itself feels like it can be pair to an itchy part of your body that is too far away to reach you want to scratch it to see what it would feel like to get rid of it to see any ideas always there of the pleasure and satisfaction it could give you until you finally managed to reach for it the sensation quickly and you're left the same biogenesis had nothing Alexander had everything but only one of them were truly free what turn on Denise philosophy that even Alexander the Great became so interested in it that you need to find and was considered one of the founders of cynicism this word doesn't have the same meaning then as today Scenic meant dog or dog like which was likely said to ridicule diagenesis and his Strange Behaviors he however took his name on his self because he actually praised the Dog and Its virtues despite it being used as an insult please didn't recognize society and by doing so he considered himself above it he therefore didn't believe in shame and would do almost anything what would do in public you would be seen shiting on the street if people insulted him he would respond by urinating on them if we seen mastur in public the list goes on a dog lives at East they don't think about the past or the future they live only according to just like diogenes despite his obscene actions diogenes was still a philosopher but unlike many of his peers he didn't wreck play some metaphysical ideas sense to him they are a waste of time and a distraction from the moment the agony is even had many famous with one of my favorite philosophers Play-Doh these stories are also really great he would for example shoot himself during Play-Doh lectures just back to lesson but my favorite story is during one of the play does lectures He was discussing the metaphysical ideal forms just said that all things have a pure Essence each thing has a form that defines their true being diogenes who didn't like metaphysical challenge Play-Doh and pointed towards a cup on a table what about this cup he said is there an internal perfect cup somewhere play the responded Yes in fact a cup can take many different forms but there is a perfect form of cupless sides inside your head then he supposedly insulted diagenesis on a simple-minded take of his complex ideas diogenes responding what about the emptiness inside the cup is there a perfect form of emptiness that exists as well played a pause for a I think you'll find it's in here where the emptiness resides finally about diogenes death there isn't much confirmed about this either some people say he got poisoned by eating raw meat when he decided to hold his own breath diogenes final wish wasn't for but rather to be thrown over the gates of the city to have the rodents and animals Feast on his body as a way for him to get back to the earth when he had taken from it biogenesis throughout history has often been referred to as Socrates gone mad their minds were very different but they both share is that neither of them broke down their own ideas they lived them instead I don't think you'll see me living in a barrel any soon but I think there's a lot to learn from diogenes I find it funny how I lost more items reading about him than actually getting robbed did
