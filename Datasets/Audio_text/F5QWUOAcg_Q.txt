quick question which one of these is I hate symbol is it a the America B the number 1 2 9 the answer is of course all of them let's go through some more examples hey remember this guy I'm actually never showed him properly on my channel but most of you probably know it's Pepe the Frog Peppa the Frog was a booming meme from 15 to 2016 everyone love this guy from what started in and just a pretty small comic book was adopted by the internet to become the what's the name of that time celebrities were posting him and what made pepper so popular was that he could be made into anything and the fact that there were so many different Pepe practically became too popular and versions of Pepe that should never have been made was which change things a lot but they were all of them deceived for virgin racist ideology known as the racist and systemic and overall just offensive Pepe memes were spread across the internet and the share of Pepe looked bleak a movement called hashtag save pepper was created by Matt Fury papers Creator to try and bring Pepe back to something positive the internet try to help even ADL try to help but it was too late Pepe was declared dead by Siri I need one of his comic strips we see Pepe for the last time this of course hasn't stopped Pepe from being buy normal people or people with bad intentions but Matt did what he had to do to distance himself from what it had become it's a kind of sad story how I hate triumphs but Matt is still trying to say Pepe if you want you can check out a Kickstarter Link in the description either way people were ready to move on but From the Ashes of Pepe came something far worse the photo from the White House causing controversy today what show was President Trump posing with White House interns at the president's request all the young men and women give his thumbs up signature he's making a hand gesture that's quite different than any of the others to some it the white power signal is made with the right hand and outstretched fingers that make a the origin of the white power okay end sign was quickly traced back to 4chan the idea was to create another hate symbol like Pepe as a way to troll and to create political some people took the bait obviously but it was also at this time that the circle game was again becoming popular online the basic gist of the game is I made you look while making the okay sign underneath your waist people mock just how stupid the idea was use it as an opportunity to provoke but it was obvious it was another Pepe and this time there was solid proof that it was a troll operation so people did the responsible thing this time and declared the okay sign wasn't a hate symbol we can verify tonight that the claim the what sign is a hate symbol is false but it's never really that easy for his background shortly after the unthinkable happen what's the forecast for track of the storm we've actually started to reposition at 6:00 p.m. play my day go up at 11:30 a.m. Jester is not okay he started to put the universal NBC Chicago a man seated behind him flashed an upside down okay gesture which is said to be a symbol of white power the Cubs actively working to back down the person who made that gesture hello it's me tired of editing this video I keep saying the argument add well the spots to go was taken by the Nazis so symbols do change meaning like it used to mean the Sun or whatever it came from Buddhism so yeah even if the okay symbol mean used to mean okay these things change the validity let's change meaning it's pointed towards white supremacist now actually using it but of course they're going to use it unlike other hate symbols this is open TuneIn stop making it so easy for these people like white supremacists have used the sign why the hell wouldn't they the problem with these hate symbols is that there's people who like to demonize other people and there's people that like to troll and these who's playing to each other perfectly they both get exactly what they want from each other one gets a reaction the other gets an outrage and then you have normal people in in between who's not even playing this game that gets caught up in it I'm not saying that anyone but there is a clear culture around getting upset it's false virtue rewarded with likes we're basically training ourselves to act like this and to be clear I don't think spamming the okay sign Hey look are you mad now and like that's not helping either obviously if you look in the instances that I showed logically the evidence that they are signaling white power is so incredibly weak but it just doesn't matter they didn't what was her name again I forgot fuck apparently she's next again half polish Jewish grandchild of a holocaust Survivor but she was accused of flashing the white power hand symbol Circle game has been using news media before it's just a way to see haha got you all everyone is aware that it's been co-opted by a small group of people and they and they shouldn't no one should know these the guy flashing the sign during the blizzard footage stepped up even though there was no reason for him to do so and explain yeah text me I actually had no idea it had any other meaning the most recent incident of this happening was the group costume at Warner Brothers that got fired because they discovered in their home video that he made the okay hand sign even though the child is doing it as well why the hell would someone symbol for white power in a private home video who is a signaling parents by acting angry and upset over these things you're giving validity to the symbol it's supposed to be dog whistle that's how this is defended all we need to we need to know what these things if it's a dog whistle is a goddamn megaphone everyone gets on the 1001 that they can deny but it also can signal their support so the argument is that you can use it and then just say no I'm just doing the okay sign so we need to know about so we can't allow white supremacist to dog whistle to each other when you come right Elations you're doing that by accusing people that aren't white supremacist of being white supremacist you are helping white supremacist I think that's what annoys me so much about this whole thing it's really not about what what's the best outcome and I think when we don't care about the outcome that's when we really destroy ourselves here's what I need you to do don't get upset about the hand sign and don't spam it like oh I'm so epically trolling you oh god oh no play sum of One race oh God brofist bye
