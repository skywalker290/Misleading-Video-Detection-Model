which will confuse shocked and even make you question human existence in itself the movies that we're going to feature in the video are going to be a range change body dialogues regressive practices and even the bizarre ideas that create a thought would make sense on the big screen we have come a long way in terms of actually making great content in the Hindi film industry because it needing past weekend generation today taking into perspective the cinema we are used to watching so here is Trident refused Productions with shockingly bizarre Indian movie scenes that will leave you speechless girlfriend one of the most don't laugh at times to Showcase a story which is going to portray a lesbian character in a Bollywood film has to be the 2004 film girlfriend you would imagine Play the movie which is going to focus on a topic that is still so sensitive in 2004 especially is extremely courageous for the director to even Steve such a character however this was not the case and sadly the director Karen razdan actually reinforce the perspective of fundamentalists about homosexuality through this film there is nothing really loud or sensitive about the portrayal of the lesbian character Tanya played by Isha koppikar and relationship with sapna paid by Amrita Arora in the film there are several moments which can be considered nothing short of embarrassing and bizarre in the film the character listen to a party with a girlfriend that they should not get drunk as getting intoxicated leads to homosexuality insinuating that the person is are born lesbian but can turn into one with the help of alcohol dim the display very successful in sleeping with women but has to be one of the creepiest dudes who is given the worst dialogues in the movie however the most ignorant and regressive part of the film is that the character rather than embracing being a lesbian owes her sexual preference to a trouble the entire film is somebody cringe Fest Madonna song which can be best described as just a cluster of actors doing as they pleased with little connection with the previous seen carrying on for 2 hours and 45 minutes of agonizing pain is the 1995 film Medina you have a very talented cast including Dharmendra Akshay Kumar Karishma Kapoor amrish Puri gulshan Grover but oh my God the find itself is the star of the film just because it is so unapologetically bad and incoherent you straight away are introduced to a character who believe that his day has been ruined because of his video daughter-in-laws you already know what you are said to witness randomly for comedic relief Shakti Kapoor dresses up as a girl and flirts unabashed play kader Khan with little to no relevance to the storyline Manoj Kumar is the most unintentionally funny aspect best to be as preachy and serious as possible but is overly dramatic dialogue delivery leaves you in splitz rather than play the Barney what what are you talking about lowering five goons and finally a brother-in-law trying to rape his sister-in-law to get to know about this horrific act and blame the woman than as a punishment he whips a uncontrollably by the way this film is just next level of randomness an action film that released in 1991 was the end Chandra directed from narasimha the film in a nutshell can basically be summarized as a who controls the city his daughter associating with an unfit match in his eyes and the conflict which arises due to his drunk right hand man you know his evil intentions and true being this was one of formula Motors first films and a character mean who is a defined in quite overly well when her father gets to know about her affair with a boy her father doesn't approve of the dad make sure with the help of guns heat up the boy which makes him reach a critical condition in the hospital the boy's mother is completely destroyed and says this to her what can be the logical thing to do now maybe confront your father tell him that he should accept this Union and give him a dramatic speech about unconditional love no easy way out to buy it makes more sense David Ashley and drive your car off a cliff with a possibility of killing yourself by chance getting saved and being in the same condition as boyfriend so that your father can understand being and make it clear now the scores are settled and by the way the film also features Sunny deol just pushing did all his might and elbowing eat a walls with his Barrel balls bulandi one friend that just has an absolute range of absurd one of the most aggressive and bizarre films is the 2000 Anil
