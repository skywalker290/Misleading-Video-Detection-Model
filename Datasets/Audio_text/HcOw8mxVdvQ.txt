Victorian is the biggest decentralised peer-to-peer. ring network in the world powered by tribe blockchain which means it has over 100 million users. and support the creators over there so if you. that's a good time baby one of the reasons I joined the live is because their mission is to not take any of the streamers earnings and that's. support streamers in a huge way ever since I join them they develop a ton of cool new features and it's been really nice to watch it grow and D live actually rewards. guys for engaging with craters which other side don't do that and get this they also have sticker feature. future which makes it even more interactive to engage with strimmer but yeah that's pretty much it catch me a d live check out the giveaway and let's get. the video Reddit review I like how everyone just stop complaining about these finally you've accepted it this is just part of the channel. today we're reviewing asshole design which it says bad design but meant to freak you over which is the worst kind. YouTuber gets every single video on his channel copyright claim despite having. rates to all the music in its videos mumbo Jumbo I loved his Outro it was so good this is so sad. it was based on one small sample that was part of his Outro right that was the issue it's so moronic that it blows my mind. Harry isn't YouTube the problem is the music industry what do you use 2 seconds of a clip that's mine mine. the whole YouTube video that has nothing to do with it it blows my fucking mind god I want to think about it I guess so angry Stop It Felix stop it.

I have to pay VAT and VAT is based on I don't even know like when you sell stuff right or buy stuff or hire. I generally it's just me or I have the simplest business of all time is this me recording videos I don't have that many revenue streams is not. complicated but still government makes an estimate of VAT saying okay based on your income you probably have to pay this. NBA team which is pretty large amount of money cuz it's like 20% or something but surprise surprise I never have any VAT cost or tax. because that's not how my business is run but I still have to pay in advance this estimate that the government wants me to pay and if I. repeat it or if I don't pay it in time they charge you 20% of that amount it's a fucking scam like it's not taxes it's just. trick people into paying money it's like a parking tickets and shit I don't even understand service tax. government we think you're going to have to pay this hundreds and thousands in VAT even though historically your business never needs to pay it but. I want you to pay it and then we'll pay you back the money but if you don't pay us in time won't charge you 20% of that amount because shame on you because. you don't text enough yeah I get it which person complains about taxes is it click shape but it it is so dumb that it makes me angry. listen to change the logo of this sub I got to say despite removing the headphone jack and how stupid and annoying that was at. now it's kind of like well I guess I didn't really need it did I now that you have wireless headphones as a standard right it's like oh. wow McDonald's now blocks at the entire. great design makes it really easy to order that is so. here's a flowchart I don't like it bad design no my league curating yes on purpose no credit. that's so true unremovable ads on my 2500 Samsung. but if you pay $1 a month we can remove ads from your TV. shut up Angry Birds shut up the y axis has zero on the tops of the grass looks like the gun death went down instead of up. yeah why is it upside down. oh my god who made this. chainsaw no oh my god my life lie my life like what was that filter. what's The Originals in UK thank you.

FedEx if you're listening FedEx fuck you what they do is. all right so sometime I received a bunch of unsolicited packages all the fucking time. package even though it's a gift technically or a samples they got a taxi well what they do is they don't charge you or they don't ask you to pay they just send. for what what package they don't tell you and if we don't if you don't pay us full of the price. why should I pay you I don't even know what I'm paying you for only if you don't pay it More Money More. so to log back.

I think with the cotton bags is that they produce somewhat they take so much water to produce cotton that you're doing much more harm to the environment getting a cotton. unless you reuse it like what's 600 times or something like that instead of of just using the plastic bags a couple more times that's.
