iPhone 11 so it's a solid improvement over the iPhone 10r and a couple ways it's a bit cheaper than the pros now it's got a price drop so this is the new iPhone that most people should buy too easy actually that this everything about what time is so easy like it's going to be super easy to review because they're so few things but such obvious things that are different from the 10 are and play this is a super easy phone for Apple to make and so this is a super easy phone to recommend maybe this is the easiest video I've ever 10 and the 10 same shape same notch same size as the 10 are it's still a pretty big phone same mute switch same speakers same aluminum rails same lightning port same LCD display with a 1792 by 8/28 resolution that not being able to watch HD YouTube videos on a $700 phone but hey people other than reviewers seem to mind a lot last year same water resistance same ip68 same buttons you get the idea what is iPhone 11 so it's the de facto standard name now and that also means they're dropping the Roman numeral six new so black green yellow purple red and white and they're all more pasteli so like add bread this year is a little lighter than the product red from last year I personally liked the colour choices of last year's 10r more actually if you are looking to get a Little Closer that's stealth midnight green look but don't want to spend the money on the 11 pro you could always grab a dark green skin from our channel sponsor dbrand 715 instead of a thousand I will of course always drop a link there are two different glass finishes on the back of the iPhone 11 there's GL do you like normal across the back where the Apple logo is now in the middle instead of slightly north of the middle but the camera Square is actually a Matt just finish now so the opposite of the 11 pro which did a matte phone and a glossy camera square and you might have already known that but when you might not know one piece of glass that's milled down to cut the shape out of it and then two different finishes so that's pretty cool no matter what but the size and the thickness and weight are exactly the same how's the 10 hour so it's still 8.3 mm thick still 194 g according to Apple cite but you do now have a battery life that turn the Apple is 1 hour longer than the iphone 10r now again I don't measure battery the same way apple does but phone 10 are already had some of the best battery life in any iPhone in a really long time and it was the reason that a lot of people who got it kept it and switched to it so I can confirm that the 11 has at least equivalent battery life to the 10r as it should now that it has a more efficient a 13 added a second camera to the iPhone 11 and it's the ultra wide so you now get dual cameras and all the awesome features that come with it like switching between 4K video from the regular and from the ultra wide camera iPhone 11 does portrait mode now more than just human faces so it doesn't have to detect a face to do the fake shallow depth of field with animals and objects and other things like that and is also new wider front-facing camera that can take slow slow motion videos take slow motion selfie videos if you want to so the only thing that's missing is you don't get the third telephone camera from the iPhone that's not a huge deal to me and both of these two new included cameras are excellent their A+ smartphone cameras photo and video quality in the iPhone 11 Pro review for this new cameras so if you want to check that out I'll link it below what's the price to say this is the best camera in a $700 smartphone debatably arguably the best in any smartphone but I still think it's sort of a toss-up with the pixel 3 but then again this has the ultra wide camera that the pixel 3 doesn't but also the this is a and then they changed the price they dropped the price so iPhone 11 now starts at and this is for 64 gigs and I think most people there are a lot of people should upgrade from that but it starts at 700 bucks now which sort of fits nicely in this gradient of iPhone prices last year for cheaper and the iPhone 8 for even cheaper and that is pretty much everything you need to know that's new with this iPhone 11 easy iPhone 11 is an iPhone with a slightly new design new cameras with an extra camera on the back a slightly better battery and a new chip as it now the question is do you recommend it and I think the easy answer is yeah this is the iPhone that most people should get but for a little more I think you should really ask yourself two questions one how much do you really care about the quality of this screen the biggest weakness of phone is definitely still the display and again a lot of people won't even notice and the YouTube app I noticed even lies to you and let's you pick 1880 as if you're watching a 1080p video but you're not it's like I said just over 720p so if you look at the iPhone 10 play if you look at this iPhone 11 in a store and you can tell it's not sharp or you really value a great display and you know it add say pick one of the pi resolution OLED iPhones the 10s or the 11 Pro and then the other number two is just the how do you feel about the size of this phone I actually really like that the iPhone 11 pro is a relatively smartphone by today's standards anyway so if you look at like the 6.1 inch screen size and it's actually too big if you've handled an iPhone 11 or 10 hour then you could go for the slightly smaller better display in
