Boga Boga Boga Boga Boga Boga Boga Boga Boga Boga Boga Boga Boga good evening turn on Papi smoria the new news anchor at 2 News our first story comes from YouTube YouTube please cancel that's alright YouTube is 570 million dollars for collecting children's personal data play very large oopsy by YouTube the FTC find Google 136 million they are forced to pay an additional 34 million to the state New York why I don't know because they collect their children's personal data this is actually an old story that happened back in September but now it looks like it's affecting everyone every single person on the platform it's pretty nuts I didn't think it was a big deal at first but look into it the more I realize this is actually a huge deal YouTube has previously said that its for 13 years and older if you sign up for YouTube you I don't know exactly how it works but they have the kids app for people younger than 13 because it's illegal I like personal data on kids that's how YouTube gets their advertising Revenue that's how I make my money because you get targeted ads play some personal data which are obviously much more worth than I don't know normal ads I guess that's Google's whole business model if you didn't know that I don't know what to tell you so what the government of USA even though it's American Bass who plays worldwide because obviously YouTube is located in America America has this government run facility called the FTC I don't know if this is which is children's online privacy protection act and its to protect kids which makes sense you know I don't think collecting kids data is good I don't want that no one is arguing for that and I think it's really confusing to me because obviously YouTube has the kids at so what's the issue I assume what happened was that YouTube created kids app and said okay well this is where all the kids go for the NFC comes back and be like actually you know what kids are still watching YouTube on YouTube this is not enough and that's why they got the but then again why is it YouTube's fault that your kid is going online decision American take on things it's never parents fault it's always someone else's fault so now whatever YouTube creator has to do is they have to make a choice when they upload a video saying what's this video made specifically for kids or was it not made specifically for kids and YouTube uploaded this video to instruct about it you create content for YouTube this video is very important to watch as it describes changes to the upload process all of your existing videos and potentially play your monetization so what you have to do now is do you have to go into your advanced settings and you can say no my videos isn't made for kids EP okay fine that's always the problem right now YouTube knows in addition to the setting will use machine Learning Systems to help us play The Apocalypse before you came to make Egypt and now you're not allowed to make family-friendly content it's so confusing well regardless it seemed like the liability was on YouTube YouTube is getting fined Federal Trade Commission made a statement and shooting fish in a barrel YouTube is the barrel and the content creators are the fish just say he's going to shoot us there will be consequences Jesus Christ this guy is terrifying there will be consequences what did I do we have a variety of tools at our disposal to call through those 23 million channels and in an expeditious way so when we what does that mean we are typically talking about civil penalties not only can we Sue Google YouTube for compliance with copper but also individual Channel owners and content creators cool so not only can people that upload content online that makes no sense control your children please so I think the maximum that f I see you before it's 50422 that's what I heard at least but that's per video basis I have 5000 videos on my channel 24 videos get deemed by FTC is targeted for kids then I own them 1 million epic I forgot to mention so what happens if a video gets made flag made for kids the video will not get recommended by other videos most of the there will be removed from 690 % of the revenue is just cut off completely and all the comments will be removed from that video as well I mean when I first well I never purposely made content for kids I never try and direct my content for kids but then at the same time YouTube now change their format so you can't swear edgy content is really not allowed so you're kind of forced to be family friendly but what things are getting punished for it you can possibly get a lawsuit it's so crazy and at first again at first my initial reaction was like yeah what I understand if you see there's a lot of clearly 100% clearly in my opinion content that is made for kids play platform which is very profitable and very very lucrative I mean you got more eggs I can't see anyone what time will the kids have his four right in case you didn't know this the most profitable Channel on YouTube is Ryan's toy review which is a World unboxing toys that's clearly made for kids okay no I don't know that's an obvious case in my really good video are you sure just how Jake Paul is marketing to kids all these colored areas is him talking about plug different merchandise and different products and touring this is all promos for kids and Jake Paul himself even said what his ladies and gentlemen we got him epic now here's what he changed for me cuz YouTube has already starting to strike down on videos and and flagging them kit for kids only and by the way what happens if the video gets fired for kids only or specifically made for kids it means you get caught up from recom play you're not allowed to read the comments anymore and most of your revenue is going to go away probably between 60 to 90 percent of your revenue is going to be gone so it's it's a pretty significant change its hitting people that I don't think deserve it like this channel for example pixel then old toys it doesn't strike me as for kids at all when I watched it but I guess since it's toys that makes it liable and that shows kind of where the line is drawn he tweeted that his Watchmen figurine was made for kids his South Park series made for kids South Park I was ready wrong I'm like but at the same time God damn this really shows and it's not just him there was another figurine Channel Jangbricks for example who just like Lego builds he's clearly not made for kids but it wouldn't surprise me if he gets delightful who made the point of why am I supposed to swear now is that what's happening cuz I'm doing doll videos again sure maybe kids watch it but how is that her fault that clearly not directed to kids at least that's not the vibe I exaggerated or simplified characters to realistically sculpted one it makes it very very you're very annoying even Cypher then as well who's done animation on my channel they are on my channel they got Fridays made for kids what because it's a cartoon because it's animation think about all the animators on YouTube now are they going to like Jesus YouTube don't make agent content also YouTube don't make family-friendly content God damn it feels like a joke at this point I think Jack is a good example too cuz I think people have this idea that Jack is family friendly or cuz he is FTC going to be able to see that new PewDiePie videos and forgot he used to swear I like yeah I stopped swearing my videos and since it's my bread and butter if I uploaded once a month and had like a brand deal wouldn't matter but I'm not going to lose Revenue just to say fuck it just seems so stupid but now is my Minecraft videos going to get I don't understand unboxing collection I don't think it's for kids but looking at how YouTube is looking at these videos how do you respond to that it feels like I'm supposed to hit this is made for kids even though I don't think it is and then if FTC says oh by the way you flag this kids we're going to see you or whatever I know this is a problem improbable thing that will happen but still it would make me legally liable if I flag oh yeah no I think you're right when I don't think it's right so I'm just forced to remove this video the only thing I know how to deal with this I love this tweet me trying to make Roblox videos for fun the FTC stop right there criminal there's Ryan's toy review and then there's people making content that kids may be enjoys what the hell are they supposed to do about that it makes no access the common suggested that I should be done on a per account BAS not her video basis yes thank you there's so many channels on YouTube that make really good family-friendly content is that not sing any more I think it's one of these things where we just going to have to wait and see and and see how FTC and forces this if you're a smaller Channel I wouldn't I guess I don't know I know one thing for is for sure what's up my 19 year old that's right you're 19 year old now I can't believe it they grow up so fast you comment on this proposition and leave your feedback if you want to I love this by the way inn in their presentation as slang and pop culture phrases such as fun free stuff whatever cool duh d you know I use ironic family-friendly jokes in my in my Minecraft series like are they going to be able to tell that I don't know stop why is YouTube can you imagine these channels that are making like figurine or Lego or whatever just like that livelihood Bing Bong you know what I mean not epic next news oh my God if I go on Twitter this is what I see Play Me avatar kids are just absolutely relentlessly calling me I transferred on Twitter I like this person with the most retweets admitted no I didn't watch the video epic so why am I transfer well because I allegedly it was in my Dr Phil video zoomer thinks his mom is too Irrelevant this video I got claimed by the way rip I'm we went through all this extensive effort to try and try and get it monetized regardless this person to me so clearly was a Jeffree Star wannabe or look-alike or inspired whatever and I honestly I don't even think about it because she had a masculine name her name was bamar and I looked it up bammer and is a boy's name so he's not that weird to think did you not know that I didn't watch the video but PewDiePie is a transform I know what his intent is at but I would never purposely misgender someone as a way to you shouldn't do it either I wouldn't do it but these dumb Anime Avatar kids on Twitter I mean your brains are not fully developed clearly you're just making noise you're not helping well he should be more responsible yeah maybe he didn't do it on purpose but he should be it's the same shit over again go fuck yourself that's it all right that was my debut puppy smoria here hope you guys enjoy continue news I think I have a long prosperous future as a news anchor I know I said I wouldn't do peonies but I think if top Pinterest me in and it's worth talking about like Papa I think it's really important I'll probably do these from time to time okay Epic thanks for watching if you want to support the Channel please by merch please oh God
