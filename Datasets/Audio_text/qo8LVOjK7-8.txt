once Attica Chauhan my writer and I kind of landed on okay this is the and you never because it just seems so improbable it's not often where you come across that kind of honesty the fact that she really wanted to tell it that kind of knew instantly that this is what I wanted to do that is a very very striking physical resemblance between Lakshmi and Deepika who is a prosthetic designer that I don't want Deepika to look like Lakshmi I want Deepika to look like busy day for us in in the trailer Prosthetics going on in full swing the very first success was to get the mold right she had to get wrapped in plaster of Paris and there were these trips could be put on her layer upon layer and we realize that eventually or nostrils will be blocked her ears would be blocked her mouth would and I'm extremely claustrophobic I didn't know what to expect because I never done something like this before at one point could not take it anymore and said okay now just you know take this off quick and clover managed to take it off and luckily we got a good life cast in the prosthetic itself there are so many stages of surgeries and and the recovery and change the color of the skin she ended up having clothes to 9 looks and then eventually they had which was the most path breaking surgery even one piece of skin and put it across her face leaving openings of the nose and the eyes on the mouth so who was the final and longest look in the film it was an intricate process but Clover is also an absolute perfectionist play honest truth is that it's tough to be in it from from how do I talk to at least 12 to 40 hours and I am claustrophobic so it's something that we have to work on every day the interesting part is that the prosthetic covers her entire face but there is and she uses her eyes beautifully it's not always only just the physicality it's also the the emotion that needs to it's not just the face but the body language that needs to come through this is Marty this is not Lakshmi even in the way the fact that meghna trusted me with it she Play Me Halfway and she trusted and gave me the freedom to bring the other 50% when an actor cracks Johnny from being the actor to becoming the character that's when magic happens on screen and all of that has come together to make Deepika Padukone into the multi of
