no break no break no break no break no break no break no break broke breakers for calories play when it comes to mobile apps like an assassination add mobile game commercials we've all seen them know I'm not talking about PewDiePie pixelated how dare you but the latest listen to annoying and bad commercial and I don't even want to say the name of the game but I guess I have to it's Lily Garden what is this freaking play I found on Facebook this is posted in August I assume that's Lily play Elise Garden you want to play that game you want to play that game so we've seen obscure and strange app commercials there's no sense but it's like they're trying to tell a story but I can't help but think it's like watching the latest Star Wars film okay things are happening but why let's watch some more Lily's Garden ads he looks like not stopped ever since he's thinking about the child in the consequences cool did Lily just do that okay now I feel less bad about Lily slapping her mom imagine making out with your daughters ex-husband and then she looks like she could go Super Saiyan so it makes sense what you slap me what's the actual game like we've seen so far pregnancy cheat lies domestic violence what is the gameplay that is not even look like Lily it better not be freaking Bejeweled this better not be the jewel match two or house same color where's the pregnancy yo you feel bad for her while they made a follow-up commercial for whatever reason we know the story he laughed but what we didn't know oh my God but if she pretended to be pregnant to get rid of the guy then surely she should not slap her mother for hang out with him that's something to think about I'm going to go inside a little bit now yes they're trying to do a story they're trying to do an epic thing how about the video game ads I get it but then they took it into the natural Direction perhaps which is sexualizing this is what we need to do with PewDiePie's pixeling we need to sexualize all the pixels because clearly this is what made the whole thing blew up this is when I call by Lily's Garden is this God awful commercial and if you haven't seen it already I apologize for showing it to you I don't need to go away I was going to point out can you know it doesn't matter band poopsie but they allow this family it's a family game 4 + that's so weird that's like having fucking sexy Angry Birds what's next give SpongeBob a bunch of hits I don't what are you doing stop it this is the gameplay there's no shaking of a Ghana there's no shaking of a Ghana this commercial was in fact so popular they made another one oh they got candles and wine do you want to play Lily's garden now not convinced now maybe you want to play they brought in a guest star Whitney as Whitney for that one that's interesting what's next are you going to shove Lily through a meat grinder cuz then maybe I'll consider buying the game it's for 4 plus after all she puts the and I think it's despicable it makes me angry Lily's again with the okay sign penis Emoji what have we got oh that's that's guest star what's my name with absolute Chad no come on excuse me for 4 plus it's family rated this is terrible you used to be good what the hell happened what are you talking about they actually used to be a game involved so is this before or after her pregnancy people need to know who is the father if Lily wasn't out doing the garden I swear to God she be on Twitch begging I know it I'm not going to show this commercial because its age restricted it's a family game everyone family game for 4 year plus poopy how we can't have that game this is actually really interesting I wonder if Apple or Google are going to change your service in the way on looking at how their marketing the game cuz obviously they're just looking at what the game itself is and they're like okay that's fine I'm just very very very very very very confused and at the same time not really I get it Lily has an Instagram which is only not that bad I'd expect to see at least a couple yoga pants shots or how there is okay nevermind her ex-husband that's crazy Lily I'm not Jamie but I'll see it a different story and you can say that again new year new drama mama oh my God what is happening oh my God that's what you get Lily you and your garden yeah go back to Garden Danish company are you fucking weirdos I know it anytime Landmark does something you know they're up to no good I know it I firmly believe that the game just exists to fundies and really what they're passionate about is telling a story and they do that so well now why would I click play on that when the game plays you can be told it smells like when you were a kid and video games used to be so differently market then because graph pooping you're the thing and then you play the game and it's like oh oh so that's the game play it's actually quite good but still that's what this is they're using the same technique and they are tricking the 4 year olds let's see what these weirdos have I'm done I'll call they also have the game called cookie cats blast which is the exact same gameplay absolutely scared wow that's so fun it's exact same gameplay why don't you sexualize Cookie Cat blast and leave Lily out of this no jokes aside who cares really it's just funny and bizarre and it gets people to talk about it that's the point of advertising really it's nothing new and I'm not working or anything to for pointing it out people I don't really have a problem with it even though I can hate Lily and I hope she dies in a fire cause you to have their new Cyberbully look at this creatures teeth they're so disgusting I wonder if I can get away with that that's it for this video hope you guys enjoyed if you did Smash like
