time to say goodbye well you seen a lot of videos on this device right here and I course along the way problems there were reports there were screen issues usato it happened in the news I talked about it extensively over on the loo later channel there is an official statement from Samsung and an official delay of launch it's just been such a hot Topic yes according to Samsung this device is not ready for prime time but that doesn't change the fact that I've really kind form Factor I'm glad that people didn't go out and spend their two grand on it only to be met with issues like some of the reviewers that got this device were met with so I think Samsung made move here but unfortunately that means even my device has to go bye bye now I received an email this morning that I there's no there's no special Circumstance here in which I can keep my SIM card in this device this one has to go back Samsung officially review when they have improved did durability the device and definitely at least change the instructions in the package regarding this screen protector that call so many problems but in the meantime I thought before I had this thing back before I slip the SIM card out of here I should do sort of a quick review so I've been using it for 7 or 8 days now usually I'd like to use these for 2 weeks but this one I'm forced to expedite the process you but anyhow first thing's first what you're going to notice if you do ever get one of these devices in your hand is that it's it's different out click especially it's different you pop this open in various circumstances you're getting a little extra attention flipping the screen closing the what kind of like what is that thing so you got to be comfortable with the fact that this is a brand new form Factor and it's going to get brand new attention the screen is for reading is unbelievable surprisingly one-handed usage as well in the camera department it's a huge viewfinder that's what it is warms like your other Galaxy flagship devices it's got the multi lens setup with the zoom there is a benefit to making a photo with a large screen device and that benefit is you have this really big opportunity for composition as you can see perform is Galaxy S10 caliber now watching video that's another area where this thing shines you flip this into landscape it's fairly evident everybody notices it and they you pop open Google News over here it's a beautiful experience it's a one-handed that action there is somewhat addictive the it's small it's unusual for this era the keyboard obviously it's small I'm still not really used to it mostly I'm compelled to get to the inside screen wherever possible we'll take a tablet it's like a lighter tablet you don't mind typing you have to split keyboard the speakers are great for if it's a foldable phone or a foldable tablet I couldn't figure that out because the way that you will generally interact with it it seems more like a table battery life was good on here I don't really like the button layout I find myself frequently hitting the finger button inadvertently it launches Bixby by default again not a fan but you can reconfigure it to launch something else at least on sing slight tweak and then change the documentation that comes in a box relating to how to treat this display and what to expect from a durability the biggest downside to me is the feeling you have around the device in and how you treat it feeling the need to baby it cuz you kind of like it moves around a little bit you know it's got this hinge and feels fancy it feels kind of like jewellery it feels fragile to be honest I don't want to drop any smartphone but picks up on this aspect that things are moving casual about your interaction with the device another Downside I showed you kiss video yeah there is a case for it but it ain't going to do much so if you are a clumsy person this this phone is probably going to be a disaster so there's certain people with certain lifestyles or certain employment that this phone also is not going to make sense for I still it's kind of a luxury device whether we like it or not the longer that I use this thing the more I realised that it's a new thing and necessarily replacement for smartphones I don't think the world is really ready to switch over to this and I'm not even sure that Samsung's ready to deliver it but anyhow phone it's got to go back those are my thoughts up until this point it's an impossible phone to recommend and to be honest that's what's on my conversations have gone with people out in the real world not here on YouTube not in the comments section your conversation play progresses to this very practical territory as a person in this position here I take the responsibility very seriously I really don't want somebody to buy something they're not going to be happy with and in most of those interactions that I had out in the now let's go ahead let's pop this SIM card out that's my SIM card boom it's out of the phone I got to put it in another phone the only favourite send it back to you guys which phone should I switch to now that the Fold is being collected officially by Samsung what would you like to see all evaluate anything choose Your Own Adventure what is this this is like tech bander SN I'm going to use a new phone put in a comments could be anything you could even write iPhone
