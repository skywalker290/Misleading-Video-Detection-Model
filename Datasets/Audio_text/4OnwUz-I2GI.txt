welcome to 2019 I'm your host Marques Brownlee and welcome to the show so 2019 was a really interesting year smartphones on this desk in front of me as is tradition of which came out during categories and each category will get an overall winner which has a trophy associated with it and if there's a worthy one will have a runner-up and POS play some honourable mentions so if any further ado let's just get right into it so the first award of the night is for best big phone almost every phone on as desk is probably bigger than every phone from the desk the way it would have looked 5 years ago but this award is for the one that the best use of that extra space that has the best big phone features and have a certain favourite in mind the best big phone for 2019 is going to go to the Asus Rog phone 2 so this phone absolutely 55 12 gig 120 Hz OLED display on the front with no notch we got front facing speakers we have a headphone jack in this phone a dual camera setup on the back and to top it all off they tossed in a gigantic 1000 million power battery this is the second generation of the Rog phones that came out this year and a lot of these features in specs keep saying or to make the gaming experience better you know the dual front facing speakers is to make for better gaming the high refresh rate forward display is to make better gaming the huge battery better gaming but all these things like I've said in the review also contribute to making an awesome Media experience and overall great smartphone so best overall big phone for sure this year but perennially Ben one of the best uses of phone space for a while now not a lot of phones can have a stylist and a 4000 milliamp hour plus battery you already know what I'm talking about going to be the Galaxy Note 10 plus huge battery big phone features big phone design and a stylus on top of it all they the headphone jack but that's maybe the only complaint about the way they put the thing together but like I said best overall big phone for 201 ASUS Rog phone 2 the Next category is best compact smartphone and I sort of mentioned this before but probably every phone on this desk is bigger than every phone from 5 years ago there's some phones on here but that hasn't stopped some manufacturers from still focusing on a compact smartphone experience is all about the best use of small space and so my winner for the best compact smartphone for 2019 S10 plus but this was the less expensive version of that phone that made almost camera and it also moved the fingerprint reader from under the glass what is a thumb button which on a smaller phone is actually much easier to reach and it was a really really fast one so it was convenient didn't feel like a loss of play that hole punch cut out in the top right hand corner still an awesome display still high on specs still get battery life and on top of all that best compact phone of the year but perennially over and over again one of the ones that makes the least sacrifices between a small version and the big version of the phone you probably already know what I'm talking about and that's the iPhone 11 pro really the only difference between the 11 Pro and the 11 pro Max the bigger version is smaller battery smaller screen everything else the same cameras the same go back the same software all the same features are all the same on the iPhone this is the legitimate flagship at a smaller size these days are much bigger than any of their previous Brothers were we got some good ones but yes overall winner for compact smartphone of the year for 2019 is the Samsung Galaxy s10e all right the next award category is best smartphone camera and this is probably my favourite category I'm probably a little biased cuz I love cameras clearly but hey it's my show so I get to be a bit bias there were a bunch of really good and really interesting smartphone cameras that came out this year we also had our smartphone camera test as I guess tradition now this one didn't win that but it is in my opinion the best and most versatile overall smartphone camera and that's going to go to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 pro Max that's for two reasons number one it has multiple focal lengths it has the ultrawide camera it has a standard camera and the telephoto and number two for prowess both photos and videos on all three cameras it's kind of funny we've always had this thought that iPhones are usually either at the best what are some of the best smartphone cameras on the market the competition definitely caught up but this year the iPhone 11 pro took some of the give steps forward over the previous year and that's especially in the image processing department we're talking the new low light mode we're talking better portra the computational photography movement has been lead in the last 2 years or so and the iPhone is right near the front of that now typically takes to me slightly photos in the iPhone 11 pro but that's in some situations I'm talking about Google Pixel 4 microphone in the world and it doesn't have an ultrawide camera but the photos that thanks for the most part I typically a little bit contrast here punchier in my opinion they feel more confident in a way but either way photography again very strong point and one of the best parts of this phone pixel 4 is my runner up for best smartphone camera of the year and of how many give an honourable mention or two here one to the Huawei mate 30 pro I got this one later in the year then come to the US and I haven't even reviewed it but I did like taking photos with it often very sharp very detailed photos you have a quad another shout out to another honorable mention and that is the blind smartphone camera test winner from this year which was Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus so those are your smartphone notables in the camera department and the winter overall for best camera for 2019 iPhone 11 pro okay so the next up category is battery best smartphone battery for 2019 and this combination of battery and fast charging or wireless charging whatever the solution is it's got to give the best power experience and I didn't have much of a choice for this one my best battery life for 2019 and any smart is going to go to the Asus Rog phone 2 this phone like I said had a 6000 milliamp hour battery which is part 1 to the recipe for any great smartphone battery it doesn't have wireless charging and it has decently fast charging but also if you turn the RAF rate of this 120 Hz OLED down to 90 Hz you were getting like a day and a half out of this thing and if you turn it down to 60 Hz easily confidently which I cannot say about to a phone that really takes advantage of having a very low power draw display and just cranking battery and it's even when it was last year I'm talking of course about the iPhone 11 successor to the already incredible battery life version iPhone the fastest charging phone that I've ever what's the biggest baddest flagship from oppo this year but they did include what they're calling what's called superbook 2.0 it's 6 what fast charging and that will bring this battery from 0 dead to 100% full 30 minutes which is incredible and so there's a couple of smartphones that had 4500 5000 million power batteries pretty big ones department for this year with the best overall battery going to the Asus Rog phone 2 next category is the Design Award and this sort of has shifted over the past couple years you know sometimes the design a what is the best build quality in a phone or maybe it should just mean like the best overall nicest design with the least compromises and maybe there's some other ways what I think is the most important design of I have no doubt in my head this is the most interesting phone to come out during this year and potentially will look back at it as the most important so of course the first Galaxy fold customers ended up breaking mine was one of those but that one ever actually sold the one that actually came out a couple months later the $2,000 it was not very popular it didn't sell a whole ton but it's of course the first all of which had their own merits for being great in their own ways this one was are the only ones that gave you the possibility of putting a bigger screen in your pocket in the same footprint and that concept that I'm looking forward seeing a generation 2 and generation 3 of and looking forward to seeing other companies take so was one of the most fascinating parts of looking also have and didn't necessarily take big risks but was a nice fresh find something that I really like to see and that is the smaller version here of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 so yes that they've made that you can really reach the entire screen at once it's still has shape and the little hole punch cut cancel Galaxy Note 10 is my runner-up in the design department so two times Samsung there and that category but the winner offer Design Award for 2019 is the Samsung Galaxy fold ok so next up is the budget phone Kate the best budget phone of the Year now it's funny we look at smartphones and yes one of the Themes as they've gotten much more cancel over the course of the last year too we have $1,000 phones we have 1500 $2,000 phones here but we're actually disconnect one of the most competitive categories yet for this one I think the top two could easily be interchangeable but my winner for budget phone for 2019 is going to go to this guy right here the redmi k20 pro so there are a couple different variants of this phone play mountain different markets but this one started at 299 wow you get some serious high-end specs you get a big notchless display you get a pop-up camera you still get a head fraction of the cost of a lot of other phones successor to the infamous pocophone from last year but it's not alone because they're really that best budget phone of 2019 is Google's pixel 3A and this was a $400 phone at lunch and this took a very different approach to the balance was four features for the price what the pixel really focused on was an incredible camera had the same camera as the pixel which one are camera award from last year and also of course the stock Google experience had a lot of the same benefits of any other pics quick software updates Pure Google experience the build quality wasn't necessarily amazing but you still got the headphone jack you got a pretty decent battery it was a lot of what people were looking for and just a simple inexpensive phone these two phones were great this year and I do have some other honourable mentions but as far as the best of fast for budget phones the $300 redmi k20 Pro and the $400 pixel 3A were pretty sweet I'm going to bring up the oneplus 7t and this was a more expensive phone this is around the $700 Mark but this was giving you all the same performance and features and speed as those $1,000 phones and was consistently call Dad as some of the best bang for the buck in the Smartphone World for all of this year and I'm also going to give a shout out to the Motorola hyper this is actually a late addition came out just a few weeks ago this year but this also really great phone for 400 bucks has competition in the area this year and that sort of stratify is this world the smartphones were now you have stuff going from $300 to what's $300 and you start to see the difference is more but the overall winner for budget phone for 2019 was your red meat k there's always some Pillars that stick out about a year of smartphones that are disappointments and that are phones you shouldn't buy so we do have a bust of the year for 2019 now I will preface this by saying the sentiment about a phone is not necessarily just about how good or bad that phone is it often also takes into account how good that phone could have been the expect for what a phone might have been and is capable of being minus reality you can probably see where I'm going with this the bus year for 2019 phone you can buy it's not the worst phone on this desk but it did have the biggest delta between what people expect play Avenue pixel and what she actually got so with the new pixel we of course I'll know to expect a great camera and the latest and greatest of the Google software experience and pretty underwhelming design with that forehead and then we started having problems we had the 90 Hz choose we had the battery problems that came with that we had motion sense not being very good and then of course there is no ultra wide camera there is no 4K 60 in video mode there's not a very good microphone and just you combine all these things on top of a launch price which was around $900 it's sort of spoke out to the world that it's competing against all these other high-end flagships but it didn't deliver on a the things that we expect from a high-end flagship so the pixel is a really great camera and it's it's sort of a phone that's going to go into the are because of the things that it was a let down on but because of that delta between what we expected from a new pixel and what almost shouldn't have existed I first saw it at c this word became very clear that they were just rushing to come out with the first of it's kind the first folding phone the Royal flex pie I kind of feel bad for anyone who actually bought use this phone clearly still looks and feels like a prototype of a folding display that doesn't necessarily have aims to be used real people but you could get one that's about all I can say about it is you could get one and it wasn't very good software experience not a great design not a great look or hold with one hand or two open 2019 is the Google pixel 4 okay back to the positive Awards the next up category is the most improved award and I love the most necessarily have high hopes for the new one and then boom big strides forward big improvements you love to see that and so my winner for most improved Award for 2019 is going to go to this guy ASUS Rog phone 2 this is I think Third trophy of the night for Asus so a little mini round of applause there the reason this is winning the most improved award this is the second generation in their gaming phones from the Rog phone 1 the reason this is most improved is not just because this 120 Hz OLED and you have the snapdragon in 55 plus and all that fun stuff the first one but a lot of people including me said that that zenui on the first Rog phone was a little bit over the top and they heard us and in this Rog phone you have the choice between that zenui or a much cleaner standard version of Android you can choose between the two and that was then listening and responding camera's not that great and maybe I really like what they did with the software on the Rog phone 2 so that is why it's got the most improved award and it's third piece of hardware of the night but I do of course have a runner up for this category and one that I think flies radar for the improvements that they typically make and that's going to go to iPhone 11 pro the reason this wins the runner up for camera suite you get the new lenses the new perspectives the new improved quality and the play battery gains from the iPhone 10s to the 11 and the 11 pro Max having the biggest battery gains of the mall so camera games are important places to have gains and that's why they a most improved Runner rap but the of course winner for the most improved Award for 2019 is that ASUS ro the big trophy over there this is the MVP it's a smartphone of the year for designs there's improvements being made we have a big choice to make for smartphone of the year and this doesn't necessarily go to the best over smartphone that you should buy right now but this goes to one that has I think the best combination of all its attributes that came out this year which is the oneplus 7 this phone is my MVP my smartphone of the Year by all accounts the oneplus 7 pro is the most liked smartphone of the Year it follow it up later in the year by the 70 and the 70 pro which didn't come to the US but the oneplus 7 pro that kicked those all off felt like best most complete smartphone of the year so have the snapdragon 855 top of the line tons of RAM the specs were great can you have a full screen hi-rez AMOLED display with no notch thanks to the Pop-Up selfie camera the cameras I think being the worst part of the is a good thing to say because they're not that bad they're blow what you'd find and like $1,000 phone but they're pretty okay and then a battery very fast charging a great software experience from oneplus and the 90 Hz 90 Hz is really where this phone start smartphones that don't have higher fresh rate and smartphones that do where do we see these 90 Hz displays popping up and I think next year you're going to start to see a lot of the I didn't get on the bandwagon get on that bandwagon it might be the year of 90 and 120 Hz screens in phones but this is where you don't have to spend 1000 bucks to get a really great smartphone experience and a lot of ways it was a better smart for a good amount of this year I am now using it's sequel the 70 Pro that is going to be the winner for smartphone of the year for 2019 but I have some runner-ups and that's the Galaxy fold again one of the most interesting phones in a really long time and sort of proving that this is the beginning of a potentially long line of new form factors and then I have some honourable mentions of course I want to give a shout out again to play pixel 3A as a potential smartphone of the year this for a lot of people is a great reason to buy a phone that's less than 400 Bucks I hope the pixel 4A continues and picks up with a 3A left off and also give a shout out to the iPhone 11 Pro taking major strides forward in a lot of areas now I'm still really looking forward to the 2020 iPhone but the games we made with camera and battery make this I think the most worthy of a pro name in any of the smartphones we have that this year so iPhone 11 pro is going to get that honorable mention for MVP but of course the winner for most valuable player smartphone is going to go to the oneplus 7 Pro and so that's it those are your words for 2019 I think maybe when we started it's really easy to see them all as this uniform of all these glass sandwiches but now it's more clear than ever that there's something for everyone still there is something whether you're interested in cameras or the best possible big phone or you want to compact phone or you have to have the best battery experience whatever it is it's really hard to buy a bad new phone now in if any of the companies that did win Awards want their actual physical trophy I am more for the best smartphones of 2019 thanks for watching catch you as the next one
