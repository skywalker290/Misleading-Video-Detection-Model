hey what's up guys MKBHD here and my God take a look at that future this is the brand new xiaomi Mi mix the new world's most interesting phone in my opinion so you remember the Sharp Aquos Crystal from a couple years ago that bezel this phone that I showed before but with the chin that kind of made it look like an old Zune HD this me mix is play 2016 Reincarnation of that concept and it's beautiful I love seeing companies go all in on like crazy unique gambles like this people like to keep saying smartphones are boring well sure we've technically seen this before but this phone takes it to the next level I don't care it 91.3% screen to body ratio so almost no bezel on any of the three top sides and a the huge display flows right up to the edges of the phone so it's just kind of looks and feels like you're holding just the display in it looks like the future and this time it's a 6.4 inch display so you're fitting an absolutely huge screen into the footprint just a little bit larger than some phones today that have a 5.5 inch display it's obviously still going to be a huge phone for pretty much play one obviously I couldn't reach all the edges with one hand and I usually can with any phone but of course show me thought of this and they included in the software a unique a little feature to bring the navigation buttons further up reachable on the display so you can reach him at any time fun fact this is also actually a 18 * 9 play which is why videos don't completely fill it like they did with the Crystal but pretty much everything else does especially if you capture play media and the corners are curved I don't know how much resolution from the official number you're going to be losing from this but that curve that pretty all four corners of the display are curved and like I said the chin isn't even that big this time this feels much more 2016 you still have all play drivers and your hardware and the front facing camera and everything down there but it's now all in a chin that's still smaller than the one in the pixel which isn't even bezel is obviously it really makes other phones bezels and edges look big so the advantage again to having this display go right up edges one the camera the viewfinder looks amazing it kind of looks fake at first actually but yeah taking photos and videos with this camera is sick really immersive watching videos is also dope when it's a native video since it's a 17 by 9 display you also leave the nav button and don't lose any screen but if it's YouTube or something some third-party app it hides the nav buttons and they get this little black bars still looks pretty great though yeah just generally everything involving content you're going to have this much more immersive experience the display looks great you got to get like a sick high res wallpaper obviously get all your apps and games they're going to look great going all the way to the edge now the disadvantage number one would be because it's so close to the edge accidental touch but the add rejection and the software already seems pretty good so that's a good sign so the biggest car now is probably durability because you know if you stop this thing without a case it doesn't stand a chance with almost no protection and this polished ceramic body is about the slipperiest phone of all time seriously and as far as I know there's only one case for it the one that comes in the box and no skins for it so if you don't like the included case you're out of luck but I guess at least the one that it comes with is actually pretty nice sing the modern look and a pretty frameless image now this is already miles past a Sharp Aquos Crystal as far as usability you it's running Android with my UI on top of it we already saw the usability feature for having the big screen and that's because this phone is actually going to be sold it has a price roughly 500 bucks and a date that it's going to go on sale November 4th so this thing is real the phone looking at the one I'm holding right now has a Snapdragon 821 chip 6 gigabytes of RAM 256 storage a 24-bit high quality DAC dual SIM card trays of 4,400 milliamp hour battery when is 16 megapixel camera it's ready to hit the streets I mean these are top-notch specs so the proximity sensor that's usually in the top of the phone has been replaced by an ultrasound sensor for the same purpose and the earpiece for hearing your phone calls that's also usually at the top is now a pie electric speaker that vibrates the metal frame of the phone to generate sound this is a smartphone concept / dream come to life and I am I'm happy to share this kind of stuff with the world again an easy route for a company you've never heard of is to just build something that's really close to what's already I'm here with people that's a big reason why you'll see so many iPhone clones but this crazy gamble of a phone that they actually made that's actually meant to be sold I love it I love it it's like if you said smartphone design was getting boring this one's for you welcome to 2016 it's not even available that's right off the bat but I hope it does well enough over in China that they do bring it over here I'm glad it exists what do you think would you rock this would just throw a pixel launch call the daily driver let me know feel free to sound off in the comments section below that's been it thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys the next one
