obviously seen you know it all right the beginning what is a challenge you faced which your parents generation never had to I think social media I think I think that they never had to face and I think it's changed the Dynamics completely for every actor and how they interact with audiences I think that you know at first there was a very aspirational relationship between actors and audiences and now it's more based on relatability and you know you can connect with people and go in charge of your own narrative but then the negative which is of course the trolling and the boycotting and then that which were all dealing with from time to time are Play Active on social media not as much as I should be not at all in fact like Karan dim my team they're all I think once every week or two weeks they have a meeting with me and then like oh yeah are you not posting that I don't know I mean I I want to post it's just I don't feel like it so now let's talk about today's text messaging culture agriculture me directly call karta Hai without texting like to pick up the call I prefer phone calls texting me about you play so many times I've typed out messages on my Samsung call me don't text me

than this gen Z language you need to create a dictionary of like your terms and your language because I think change the olive Indian Olive Bombay is only talking in your slang terms got send and then vocabulary play generation gap concert family member ke sath field hota Hai and what is it usually regarding basement I think the way that she thinks and how independent and fun and chilled out she is about things and I'm very and I'm so what is that one conversation gen Z must have with their parents and one station this should not have I think one conversation that they should have with their parents is just to have an open dialogue I think turn on relationships because I think it's such a defining factor of any you know young person's life and one conversation they shouldn't I don't know I mean I think a big part of your childhood and youth is like you know be a little bit of a rebel and do things that no you're not supposed to do like yesterday for the first time I told my dad that I lied to him and I told him that I was going for a movie but I took a flight and I went to play some Ellie and I like room to round and round back in the morning and he didn't know but I think right of course now in the dark want it all movement tell me about the time in your career where you thought you would need to compromise on something but eventually you like finally got it all I still don't think I've gotten it all I think that sometimes when there's been like a project that I wanted to do but like because of dates and all of that and I've had to pass on something but I think in the end everything happens for a reason and you do what you're supposed to do and if you give the opportunities that are in front of you your send it all turns out okay I think and when it comes to romance and dating do you think your generation is lucky to have so much is it a bad thing but I said make a sick happy play Josue I don't know the fox say that but a lot of my friends you know he was Bumble and they go on these days and I think what is not experience Hotel 1965 and speaking of romance and dating in this generation it's all about women making the first move right so we have you ever asked someone else never but I'm very sorry I'm very like I'll drop my hands but I won't make it too obvious that I know that the other person is for sure interested but Mother Nature what are the same with

pastime is to watch cooking shows online free domesticated play I'm hoping that you know once work starts now I'm feeling Life Won't you know any longer be to make cupcakes and you should talk to movies sing something that people from my generation feel is social media and instant messaging Khmer I think your generation is constant instant validation whether you know the movie releases you get

I've seen this happening people and it's not hard work you know to kind of achieve their goals yeah for sure do you like me but I'm sure when you're on road to that and I believe you want to ask me a since you get that this is your turn to ask me a question now all my guests get that chance they apology powered by Bumble so my question to you is that you don't what's Alicia to Hotel Transylvania how do you make the first move to go out to the direct and request him okay without seeming like you're not good at your job or something no I think you know it's absolutely an artist prerogative because what's an actor is in front of the cameras giving his best and the artist has to be happy and if you're not happy you're he's not happy I think they have to go up to the director and say that I feel I can do better and let's do it you know I mean I don't even want to think about in front of the camera thank you so much for coming on my shows really really special and lots of love to you is
