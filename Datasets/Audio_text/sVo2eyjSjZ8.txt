annoying things YouTubers do what's up everyone it's me the least annoying YouTuber there is I just wanted to epically rent today about some stuff that I noticed YouTubers do that is kind of weird there's a lot of it doesn't necessarily get address a lot it probably does but regardless I'm going to go through it and then I'm going to ask you guys what your pet peeves I guess we can are and we'll compare if we have the same okay number one this is very specific but I found it as a perfect YouTubers have no idea what they're doing so they're just copying everyone else we have sniper wolf with a tiny tiny bit for whatever reason people think this is something worth replicating this tiny bit of red in a background of the photo that's what's going to get you views apparently people just should I pick any other colour okay play started as well with sniper wolf and was it azzy who practically looks so similar anyway and they have the exact same you know that photo of a human where it's like all faces combined this is going to be every YouTuber eventually what is that this is how old YouTubers are going to look in the future I know not that important Felix no one cares it just shows so much to me all right turn up the second point which is the description of videos I hate the description of videos I don't care about it but it's one of those things as a do you have to write a description because it's so important for people to find your video a lot of channels will I mean I don't even know how it works to be previously used to be taxed as a way to find a video through searches and it didn't have to be in your face you can just put in a bunch of tags yada yada and it's so obnoxious look at this I mean clearly it works you write but after child while play music video goes viral by Queen created play and pc-9 brothers and sister question mark test results from upgraded hacker PC 71 ft 150 review upgraded hacker defeat it's a way to get all the videos recommended by sing the title of other videos in this one searching for technology to destroy project zorgo on the explosion projects or a YouTube channel it's not about the content it's more how you can optimise your videos in a way that people will be will watch it it's loud it grabs attention and people don't question why they watch it it's just there in front of you because it hits every single Mark or what YouTube is asking for if you any video that just starts immediately super intensive they it's a it should be assigned to just clicked off immediately you're not going to get add a description and I just cannot care less I don't want to boohoo right it's just so lame springs to the third point which is YouTube thumbnails I mean this has a long history back with like I think to same face every single thumbnail for whatever reason having just this face in the thumbnail will do do you know how annoying it is I'm so sick of it but it's so useful for people to know hey it's doing the thumbnail you know what from now who's going to be my thumbnail for every video I like this David dobrik one as well just like just mirror the image I can't be bothered it's too so goodnight a thousand of these stupid faces in the thumbnail it's like no I'm done I'm done I'm officially done I've done too many number videos that have a question that I could not give less shit about but I'll wash the whole thing and I'm thoroughly enjoyed it always a sound like I've learnt a lot but I will never need to know this is the world running out of helium I don't care but why why Costco is cheaper than Amazon I don't care distilled click on it Felix you clearly don't understand my impulsive habits that I can't control ok why Joe Rogan won't why planes don't fly I don't care stop stop roping me into questions that I don't care about stop giving me knowledge and stuff I don't like it and it's doing why doesn't the heart get tired I don't care I don't care I don't care stop asking questions your titles I don't care I don't care do I have to say it more why your aim still sucks I found this when I accidentally clicked on this video and it's number five pointless rewards for videos who knows me better Daniel or Regina the winner will get 10,000 why it's always like this though you need to know you can't just do anything now they have to be like 10 grand on the line or something weather gets 5 billion and they're never satisfied in the end when they win the Lego so many YouTubers do this now we're like pay 10,000 pay 10,000 and I don't get me wrong I think people can do it right and a lot of people do but it's one of those Concepts that clearly works on YouTube to life winds 20000 to itself yeah I want 20,000 from my own money what's up cool number six I think I were up to 6 likes on the screen is the thing that's happening now and it's one of those things where it makes me feel make an old leave a like like subscribe cool the video just began why stop it I get it it's like a way intrusive way to get people to like the video but it's another one of those things that clearly works and everyone just does it and now it's a standard and this annoying and I don't like it boomer this is Boomer runs by YouTube basically which brings me into the next one is when a lot of times you'll watch like a video just to understand how to do something and an instruction video and for whatever reason they'll still tell you okay maybe it's like how do you fix can you download this app on your phone or something stupid I don't know and by the end that I follow me on Instagram guys no no I'm not going to follow my Instagram I mean I could just ignore you saying that but why would I know your place if you make text tutorials then maybe people don't give not everyone needs a podcast is there such non problems number 8 or 9 I remember it doesn't matter raid shadow Legends have you guys heard about raid shadow Legends but don't take my word for it take all the reviews that are it has 5 million reviews and they're all 5.9 average and oh wait if you now you get 50,000 gold whatever that means and you can also read shadow Legend with me maybe you can find me in the if you play an average shadow Legends listen I'm not going to hate on people getting bread on YouTube I think it's great but for fuck sake stop rewind that does rage shadow Legend shout out it's the same script for everyone they literally just said ok you need to say all these things and then play Rage shadow Legend shout out sounds exactly the same and it's so annoying what's this the most immersive RPG

gamer red shadow Legend is game where you can pick class and play game graphic good alright those were my pet peeves by YouTube do you agree with them do you not let me know in the comments I'm not going to read I'm kidding I do read comments okay so I asked them Twitter what your pet peeves are about YouTubers which I think is pretty interesting talking super slow and it's noticeable they're trying to make the video longer some people on YouTube speak so slow I always watch videos on X2 speed and some people speak so slow that even times two makes longer videos so people drag them out for no reason at all and it's very I can't say that I'm entirely guilt-free on this but I've seen the worst examples and it blows my mind that people are okay with it they never really help call YouTubers oh I remember when I used to do that remember that and then people started calling me Nazi for it it's epic that this is why yes this is so true don't care about your car accident that left also guys tell me about the background audio in this video we got a little bit of construction going on outside hope that isn't too annoying for you guys in the background anyway also when they have a camera for 3 years can't relate can't relate to this at I also think that I know this is kind of a stupid argument to make but when people get too polished of a setup like a studio and next super Chris quality camera and everything is amazing which is nice don't get me wrong and it fit certain channels but it almost feels what kind of lost touch with what in my opinion YouTubers when it's too Polish it's almost like on the side of the screen most either 60 to 90 seconds so you just double tap 6 times and if they're at is still going double tap three times and you're good to go you're welcome gamers starting a podcast there it is for no reason I don't noises so much I like podcasts as much as the next guy but why do I have the people I follow feel like they need to have their own aimless podcast I ain't got time today I like this because clearly you can just ignore it you don't have to consume the podcast it doesn't hurt you in any single way at all but whatsoever but I'm still very bothered by it I don't like it skipped over really important items in on video games well when you're doing commentary and you're focused on keeping it interesting it's hard to Play Away as you do when you just watch a video and you just it is different I remember when I play with friends and talking over insane amount of story sorry sorry German games most game developers aren't riders and the writers that game developers hires bad they cannot write they can't it's awful and it just feels like you're having your time I remember watching the documentaries of the how they made the Halo cutscenes and I find it so interesting how they kept revision doing it's the original Halo games because they're approach to storytelling in the cutscenes were we seeing people's time we need to make this as interesting as we possibly can and I think that is missed on a lot of games feels like they need to drag out the game to be as long as possible which kind of ties into YouTube in a sense asking people to like and subscribe play channel 10 seconds into the video this is one of the things that just doesn't go away because it clearly works despite how fucking obnoxious it is remember when I started doing YouTube videos and I felt awful just asking for subscribing at the end of my earlier videos I'm like if delete this far in the video then maybe consider subscribing and I remember I remember like getting 2 or 3 more subscribers because I used to do that and I'm like holy shit I found a gold mine hey guys subscribe why can't you just I really don't like it either I think it shows immediately when the video is pre-recorded and it makes it interesting in a sense I don't know why because it's such a subtle thing but I only really work ahead if I have no other choice leave your opinion in the comments I always read the comments I think I think it's super fun if I don't care comments it probably means I don't care about the video I just created to be honest I think it's a good way to know it if you made an interesting video or not I first thought don't like a common thing was interesting but now I just find it a really annoying way for YouTubers to Shell like positive calm actual democracy opinion of ideas are but then I have to feel like I have to scroll through I have to there's a session I'll probably comments to get what to people are actually saying do you understand what I mean that's I found myself not even using this feature another one makes a 15 to 20 minutes about some other creator how much they hit their content and despite following along and and just taking it too far so it's almost like you have to say it based around calling out other channel that's all they do and then they get called out and it's and it's the biggest drama ever how could they say this about me but do you have a point here with this cos it's like you're creating this atmosphere on YouTube where it's being overly critical and and and things like that putting more emphasis that being overly critical is is important when it really isn't oh god I'm a giant hypoc starting an interesting sentence about themselves or their own life experience then gets distracted and then they never finished and finish the sentence we're going on tangents is something I see a lot of YouTubers do especially when you're new because you think it's like a quirky way to speak but it's just really really really really annoying if I ever go on a tangent you may have noticed this I always acknowledge that I go on a tangent just so people know that I'm working on something excited but I can't tell you yet yes the announcement of the announcement that's always very interesting just shut the fuck up then I hope hardware and drinks and and a sponsor all in one video is kind of Much video I think with games I have another one coming out poop day on 12th of December I don't give a fuck if you have a problem with it games is really hard to time the other things a lot of times you're working with different people and it I mean it is very criticism but at the same time game specifically is very hard to time it's literally just a coincidence and I think it's cool stuff too like I don't know I don't care when they actor as a familiar that can relate to someone working two jobs and living paycheck to paycheck it's like some of them hi there well meanwhile we're all aware of it I think it makes it worse when they try to hide it and relate to this system level yet see this obviously in your face with like look at the car look at the house wait and when that becomes your that's a lot more annoying than trying to hide your wealth but I also think a lot of YouTubers are scared of showing that they have money to lose that sort of connection Guardians and that's what people do it when I think in reality it doesn't matter what level you are on as long as you are honest about what you're doing and can express what your fears are people will still understand it even if they can't relate to it I really complain about YouTube and how bad it is to expensive equipment and like stop are you actually disagree with this to a certain extent because I think I find myself being more critical about things that I care and that doesn't mean I think it's all bad but it's it's things that I think can make improve it's just giving constructive criticism or pointing I really want you to do well but I think it's Small Things I think the thing with YouTube beside eventually cuz it's ridiculous to care about this tiny little problems oh people are stupid each Pro all these things I think we'll find it maybe it's not entirely possible that we find ourselves looking at it play YouTube that has been shaped in a way that we don't want it at all and I think that's my concern when addressing these things not so much do you agree disagree I read comment play Let's alight actually no it isn't lie I got you know when everyone spam the comments and it's the same one I just sort by new alright the hour of foxtel and poop greatest Marcia Edgar in patterns need your help the time where you will face but crawlers in his arms and hands when you are I'm not supposed to have my opinion but the price is
