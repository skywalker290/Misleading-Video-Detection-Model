Cook Apple CEOs face there is looking now what's a dignity and doing the right thing made by a company that runs sweatshops in China so what you say okay a couple things like it's funny right I like this don't get me wrong second of all this is not the fourth time he the Golden Globe and the first time he's like I'm never going to do this again so like I might as well just go all in and that was the whole premise that's why it was he was never going to be able to do it again here he is the fourth time doing the exact same shit saying oh this is the actual last time so Jingle All Out sicko mode are you telling me seriously you never bought any product that has been producing China and this is coming from someone you know me and do you have a brand Suki where we we produce ethically in Canada because we want to avoid sweatshops and obviously there are legitimate fact my point is what I find in general is that people don't care product come from and unless people start caring where their products are produced then you can't really call out people like Tim Cook even though I do agree it's fucking obnoxious hearing these Hollywood Elite preach about a bunch of shit cuz it is toe death I agree but at the same time don't necessarily think his argument really holds up just wanted to put that out there everyone that thought he was so epic when he said that better not be holding a
