that I'm the best lover in the world if you don't tell anyone I'm going to tell you I'm not but I never let that assumption go away call Sabine me to understand a lot of you here who haven't seen my work and I feel really sad for you that that doesn't take away from the fact that I'm completely self-obsessed movie star should be that's when my my friends Chris and Juliet called me here to speak about the future you play photos I'm going to speak about the present me because I believe that humanity is a lot like me it is it is it said it's an aging movie star you know grappling with all the newness around itself wondering whether it got it right in the first place and still trying to find a way to keep on Shining regardless I was born in a refugee colony in the capital city of India New Delhi my mother was just a fighter like mothers are and much much like the original home we will struggle to survive when I was in my early twenties I lost both my parents which I must admit seems about careless of me now play I do remember the night my father died and I remembered the the driver of a neighbor who was driving us to the hospital remember something about dead people don't tip so well and walk away into the dark and I was only 14 then and I my father's dead body in the backseat of the car and my mother besides me I started driving back from the hospital to the house and in the middle of a quiet crying I looked at me and she said son when did you learn to drive and I thought about it and realized I said to my mom just now Mom so from that night onwards magic into Humanity I learned the crew tools of survival and and the framework of life was very very simple Celiac was table and a vegan of course was a Mr Sparks lost comrade in Star Trek you married the first that you

I shifted to the sprawling Metropolis of Mumbai and my framework like the newly industrialized Humanity began to alter I'm at people who are descended from all over the world things became more and more fluid work began to Define you at that time and all the systems started to feel less reliable to me almost too thick to hold on to the diversity of mankind and the human need to progress and grow expedient play soulfulness of this Collective Endeavor catapulted mean to Superstars I started to feel that I had a right and I'd be knighted by the Malaysians I've been given the highest level on Earth by the French government the title of which for the life of I'm sorry France and thank you friends for doing that but but but but but but bigger can I go to meet Angelina Jolie for 2 and 1/2

happened I was in my late 40s and I started treating like a Canadian a bird cage and assuming that you know people who will appear into Humanity an expansion of ideas and dreams with the enhanced connectivity of the world we had not painful definition that flowed from the same place that freedom and Revolution was taking place in everything I did good bad ugly lock everything I didn't say or do also sorry I mean decided to have a third child child of a first child who was 15 years old while driving her car in Romania 19 now even now when you say hello to him he just turns around and says but bro I didn't even have a European driving licence and I started to feel that I could not be who I wanted to be okay what I actually thought and Humanity at this time completely identified with me I think both of us were going through a midlife crisis play Cummings and Overexposed Primadonna I started to sell everything from hair oil to diesel generators Humanity find everything from crude oil to nuclear reactors you know I I even try to get into a skin tight superhero suit to reinvent myself I must admit I feel miserable Spider-Man and Superman of the world you have to come in command them
