parts to speak about their takeaways from this unpredictable year how to change the relationship with their art and the waiting on the best acting they've seen earlier this is the welcome to the actresses Round Table 2020 ladies it's good to see you and who would have thought we would be doing the Round Table in this way but thank you but but I really do want to start by saying thank you and let me Raymond and the role that artists playing our lives you know we dependent on your art to tide us unmute for a moment and really give yourself a round of applause thank you I want to start by asking you all did this year and all the uncertainty that did that give you an opportunity to reflect on what your art what your job means to you certainly is give me at least a time to introspect and really sickly question my own values obviously because my being an actor is important part of my being I was very grateful that the world I think realized that the only ENT that they could get in this very dark times is through artists and that made me feel you know that I my work with renewed vigour and it has been a challenging time but for me give me the most important thing that the lockdown has done Rajeev is to make the hair and then now the most important almost in a way that I had never experienced before because I think all of us play live in the past or we keep planning the future but very rarely do we live in the present in the way that we did so in the beginning I was hoping oh my god when when is this pandemic going to end at cetera et cetera and then I just let it be and I said it's going to be here and now let's deal with what we have now and that was how I dealt with it I have always been a video of what I do so in terms of you know the kind of things I pick up which I feel should be Singapore posterity like in all possible ways and we should be able to get entertainment revisit and enjoy that that has been regardless of pandemic in my subconscious so that part of the thinking that happened but what I you know how much I it's it's more like a personal realization not with respect to the end up being a part of it was more like how much I enjoy and feel peace at when I'm at work I was almost overworked and overburdened a few weeks before pandemic hit us because I was shooting for using the robot I had two films ready to go on clothes in 2 weeks so I was almost like time zone so and I don't know I almost was cursing myself maybe at the back of my mind somewhere I pray that I get a little I really really actually understood gratitude at this time because I felt that there was so much happening in the world and yet there was so many positive things what's happening in my own life so I really felt a lot of gratitude also this time also really reinstated my face in human I saw a lot of very timely and sensitive Civil Society initiatives around me at a time like this which would be and it made me feel that I possibly want to more than just that and that I've never experienced that before this has been my obsession for a very long time and in the one thing that I focused on how many many years you know so I think those were some of the things that I was going through Deepika that I've been feeling and generally been feeling over the past year or so but I feel like what if there was even an iota of any kind of you know it's like an onion field and then so I feel like the pandemic just stripped everybody off everything and go back to the absolute Basics and that was just such a lovely experience to and gratitude grateful yes of course being cognizant of you know so of course you know keeping all of that in mind and all of that effort has gone into it but at the same time every single person has has come out of this pandemic with a different experience and mine has been gratitude doors and I'm a person who cannot sit at home so I was losing myself initially in the lockdown but then you watch news see how people are suffering how people have actual problems people you know I don't have food to eat or they didn't have a place to stay and thank God that I have a place to stay and I have food on my plate so I felt grateful for all those things and I think as I'm just making sure that you know we are always planning our future you're always anxious about the future husband what film am I going to do next and is there anything happening for me and we forget to live in the present so I think I have realized not going to plan anything from now on and you know just live in the moment it's difficult it's not it's it's you know easier said than done but you know we have to work on it and I've just realized that I'm not going to plan anything for myself I think you speak yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah think there's so many learnings because but one of the things that I want to share which was that I myself for the first time dealing with feelings that I've never felt before you know it was that I've never had an anxiety attack I've heard about people dealing with it and I guess I've just been in a part of a very loving Lee and very loving friends and a very loving partner and I and I didn't know what what it feels to have you're hot like to feel your heartbeat in your ear in your veins and it was and it involves the you know it involves the the private involves the public my mother was and because we were stuck there for her treatment and the Pune police the hospital workers corporators I was stuck in Bombay for some time couldn't get permission to get to her they were corporators complete strangers chemists who were sending my mom and dad food I didn't know them you know I just I was looking at you know numbers online and I would find the I think it really changed my sense of you know location for the for the kindness of strangers you know and I think I really experienced that when I met the nurses and my went to so many surgeries I spent so many nights in the hospital where there's so many covid patients and and the nurse I would see me crying army officers doctors nurses initiatives of you know certain lawyers that you know we know of who were doing so much I found so much dignity so much so much courage so much love in Strang Offline that one of my key learnings was to really stay away from online you know and I found that that actually interacting with real people people who I would Angelina interact with at all you know so I think that was that was my learning amongst many I feel like this is going to get emotional but just like to know I said I feel like I've gone through such a gamut of emotions this entire and it's not necessarily because of anything that's happening directly in my life but just really around me maybe it's because I'm an empathetic person maybe it's just the sensitivity of the situation but I just felt so connected two people I didn't even know and I felt like I think that's when you realize just how grateful and blessed it is just to be it's been it's still is a very emotional time you know I do value my work but not being able to be on set I think is a feeling that hadn't anticipated I didn't think that I would have to deal with hopefully for a while but the situation that all of us found ourselves in and being away from just being on Saturn in front of the camera I think more than making me miss it made me realize how depend many reasons emotionally for for even reasons of vanity and I think that more than King as an artist what's most important is your willingness to evolve and how well you know yourself I think I think very dependent on all these things and I think we're all of us have experienced during this pandemic is unparalleled to what you the most artists of other Generations could have experienced and if we were open enough for good enough to get involved in some way through this experience I think that we would have all benefited a lot from it and I've tried to be open to that and I think more than anything just getting to know yourself better spending time with yourself it's it's not a normal scenario play any means to be first of all locked up in your house you know to have this constant fear of health and and to deal with things to get to know yourself but I think that I think that if you get through those gamut of emotions you you the goodness that surround you you see what you're capable of what humanity is capable of and I think that take away from it and I hope that I have and I hope that it shows in the work that I'm hoping to do in the future she spoke about how you start with ignorance to all of you what did you or are in what way did you come out Wiser from the role that you played this year or how did it battling with because a lot a lot of good came out of but that my expertise is not is not so I'm not such an expert that I can create their owners and their and and I don't know what is the best mix of it whether it ever goes away or not whether you know expertise really be a substitute for honest or not or each has its own place and you have to accept that a different stages in your career because you know when you're working a lot you get thrown into different situations and it's not always there are some experiences in which you have that in some experiences that you don't and sort of commitment even if you're in the bizarre situation and you accept anything that anybody gives you any work with that and I think I say something very picking up from my phone because every film I feel changes so what I what I put back home and I keep telling myself again and again from tuppers so I realize that every time a film of mine came out I was so nervous I mean we always nervous before release but I was always seeking validation from you know people from the screening or the seeing what's happening what's happening on Twitter reading it but for some reason when guilty was releasing I think because of the process and because of everything that I went through and was such a cathartic experience for me as an actor and I just I don't know if I knew that I just don't like I was proud of myself and I don't think nothing like that before I was always doubting already I could have done this better I could have done that better even when I saw guilty that you know through the get the proper Final Cut I just fell inside that everything that I was feeling and that we had you know and everything I was like for the first time I'm happy with myself and I feel I never I never insecurities and doubts and I could have done this better than that for the first time that happened and process made it fulfilling then everything else and I think that's you know I think acting is a very fulfilling profession because you give to the part and the part gives to you and that happens very rarely except with artists so when I inhabit the world of Satya Massey in the film Kali Qui there is an experience of something almost physically to which I have had intellectual and emotional response the the problem of a female in fantic is something that I have dealt with as a member of Parliament and as a person working with women's but having to deal with Satya Mansi not as somebody who is a very strong person but somebody labors under the guilt of this huge secret that she has somehow you know when I'm acting did the work sometimes from the outside in or sometimes from the inside out and in Satya Massey to my feeling that this would be a woman very heavily burdened by her show her posture would be heavy her shoulders were droop her voice would be deep and I completely and totally let go of my vanity which let me tell you is not easy thing for an actress to do it at any point in her life and to me that was I an accomplishment in the sense that I have not experienced that before because I do feel whether it was the uni what are the completely ungainly look I made for myself I could see myself in the mirror and I could say oh my God I'm not looking good but it was so important for satyamurthy to be that that I think that that made me sort of rice Notch higher lovely but then what Google has taught me this year is that you know you can be a flat person but you have to be comfortable in your own skin the person who is flawed she you know is not perfect but who is perfect in this world we are all flawed and we just need to accept flowers in and own up to a place so that is something that I've taken back from Google I think I'm much more comfortable in my own skin and with my I used to always be nervous talking to people but I think that nervousness is kind of gone away standing of the life of an acid attack Survivor you know the person is thinking what their experiencing emotional as it is and and you know and and through your journey through recovery if you're fortunate or lucky enough if you even survive that is when the ground reality of getting jobs are difficult finding getting into a relationship is difficult so you're alive but you're or you know you don't get the same opportunities why can I not work in the same bank as you know as as so just having that's all the difficulties the challenges and then also the goodness in it I mean you have people character who come in and just love you for who you are so I mean of course there's the challenges practical challenges the emotional challenges the put through but then also the beautiful things which is you know the fighting spirit and and how eventually it's about what you want to do with your life and what you want to say all the fact that you have people like amul who who who are not judging you for what society believes as beautiful physical appearance I think all of those you know we're going to see the effects of that 10 years from now when we see more lakshmi's amongst us for all of us to be more inclusive is I think is is what I've learned it's very call to kind of articulate and say this is the one thing but because it's been an experience and something that I I would never have traded to sort of do anything else for for that experience you know I've grown as a person show the film and you know my interactions with guns and Mom and I think her entire narrative my biggest take it was actually accepting myself and the importance I think of self-belief and I think even you know through do you send through the Journey of making the film and and the feeling of whatever happened afterwards read me realize that unless you are accepting of yourself unless you believe that you deserve to be in the place that you want to be no one else has any reason to deserve to think that you deserve it so you need to believe that first for others to believe it and to accept it and I think that it's been such a big part of my narrative as a person to think that I know I don't deserve to be here but I proved myself and I'll work out which is like it's important because I'm not feeling by any means that I arrived but like I think I think that through this journey I've just realized the importance I think at least of self-belief and and how strength doesn't necessarily mean that it needs to be measured by an outward but I think strength can be silent dignity can be you know subdued but it doesn't mean that it is so yeah I think those have been my takeaways question about the runners and the expertise I don't know why this feeling of honest doesn't go it's been you know I think maybe I'm just that kind of person who feeds on a nervous kind of energy and when I feel that nervous energy when I because you find something about yourself and I think that so I don't know if I'll feel turn off the 10 years or you know that I feel like you know I'm finally feeling like an expert and you know and as far as what store taught me well it's been 2 years you know since you know we shot for the so I think I've had three time to to sir talks about a love story between a man and the woman who works in his house is made and I realize when I read the film myself that I have all the pictures to me that the film critiques actually you know the fact that think of the people who work in my in my life because of the class where they come from as people all the fact that I'm so deeply entrenched in this class biases that I've she checked out a man who I think is not of the class that I belong to like you know I've never got into an Uber cab like when I was a student in New York but I realize that this whole thing I think I'm a nice person but I'm reading the script I really felt like man so far away and and yet we can't even imagine a world in which we could fall in love or we could feel and that really broke my heart you know that broke my heart that I know equality doesn't exist but it was not nice to know that about oneself how wonderful to have a film that puts you in touch with that that that that YouTube really reflect on that and then very nice one must do I feel like that I'm listening to this group talking and marveling at them because see how the scenario of the Indian woman as send it in Hindi film is changing I mean in the 60s you had a film called matchup rahungi I will remain silent as as a value that was given to women and do you have so many young actors here some of them just a couple of films old and that they're being able to discuss how that part has affected them in real life for me is the very basic thing of what any art does because I believe has the capacity to create a climate of sensitivity in which it is possible for change look up not only in society but also to yourself so how far Hindi films have and I think that is something that I want to celebrate and congratulate everybody over here and thanks sing the base for a time and we can all thank you for having done that that time we could look back at and think that if you thank you common to many of the characters in these films is the importance of all the need for dignity insert your Define not by her circumstances but really the dignity with which she carries herself she has dreams she has hopes she never sees is really desperately fighting it is to be treated with dignity and inclusivity like you said taapsee Amrita are your character dignity in most intimate of spaces within a marriage Janine gunjan to you know she expects and demands the dign refusing to be discriminated against on the basis of her gender you know I want to ask all of you as an actor how do you negotiate that fine line where the pursuit of dignity does not come off as a plea for do every character that you play and I feel like that layer is what comes from me and I'm not someone who's ever done anything for pity so any character that I play I think if I had to do it like that sure if I had active and do it maybe but I think intrinsically that's not the person I am and so I do you like having empathy and understanding their lives you know so why should it not have that why should it not have that later why should it not have that angle why should it why should it come from a place of pity is the so yeah I think it's a combination of who I am as a person and and your life character that I'm playing that kind of helps me then you know play it like that you know victimhood is celebrated a lot when it comes to women's character in India especially we've grown up seeing how it's only it only has to be the habla Nar or the other extreme of being the one that they're really things in between which make us feel and look real so I think now the point is that being a victim is okay up to a limit but then what do you as a character do some about yourself what do you learn from that being that victim and how you real locate there is a dignity realization of that dignity and then to stand and fight for it so it has to grow now from just being a victim to how you going to use that situation that made you the victim to realize your risk that also deserve respect equal respect and again you know I maybe just the right brilliantly so I'll that says that that all that Amrita wanted was all we want is respect and happiness and that's what we do great and hope it just exponentially increases the strength of women I think first and foremost it's just unity and respect is a basic human right it's not like you're asking anyone to do you a favor by demanding your dignity or respect and and yeah as far as the whole self-pity angle goes like I said once you understand that it's a human right it's not even a thing to ask for and I hope all of us get to that stage in the world where it's not something you have to fight you know someone with any sort of disabilities or an outcast in any way I think it needs to be inculcated and conditioned in us as a part of our human nature and upbringing meteors is what you must give to everyone and I think also it goes against the grain of how gunjan is 2 have kind of approach that coming from a place of self-pity because of you know her all that she was in her entire journey and her entire fight was about not relying on self pity and I don't think that if she because everyone would want to put you away like he is Duniya mein kaise so that's the natural reaction and I think that I think that Betty was what she was trying to escape from others and from herself also 20 years later again I'm playing issues with my own dignity and you know and it was great and you know so I mean you play characters like this and you really hope that they brush off on you you know come back home and I will imitate you know something I really liked about them maybe the way they just flick the hair or you know the way speak so I know I'm a bit of a copycat like I love like you know like there's a bird called a jacked up it basically makes Nest from things that it collects from every other bird's nest you know so I agree I think somewhere in my heart I'm leaving and like how can you be so happy and ask for dignity is concerned it's not the cultural capital of the rich you know there are people who owns that what's so liberating to play and was such a like you know such a gift play someone like that and realize that if there is any pity it is the privilege and then title who look at right now with idea of you know who is entitled to have dreams it doesn't you know so if there's any pity it's actually the the IG the well-meaning privileged entire class that I belong to you know so I have no sorry for myself not for complex motives women who the power of their sexuality is it a tough act to pull to play a character who is it instantly like and get someone that the viewer has to become invested in and has to eventually care about I think that the funny thing and I guess that's what that's what and now after season 2 has released somebody told me one day they said you know because I never saw like that to begin with and I'm glad for that I think it was in the right thing because this there were vulnerabilities how excited to play her because here is somebody who wears a sexuality on her sleep here is somebody who enters the room and has a magnetic tell somebody who just lives her own life with complete Freedom while while living in a house with these patriarchal men and a very oppressive sort of environment and I I was kind of a very intrigued by Bina from the time I read her and I was just I always say I live by character who walks into a room and people look at her so I was always intrigued by I have always excited by her always been excited by women in life which which draws attention I find that so I guess that's what made it easy for me to be here I think it's all in the writing and I feel like it it was really challenging to play nanki I'm going to go back your question of dignity and pity because I was thinking about it when you know with in contact with there's something that she says in the film that really stayed with me when she said she doesn't want to be seen as a victim but as a Survivor and the irony is that although she says that she doesn't mean it till right at the end of the phone so in the beginning I'm a Survivor and the school girl with the crazy hair and the tattoos and you know it was her armor but she had a lot of pity so she would not she would not admit to what has happened to her and her childhood and she would you know not want to talk about it and not want to talk about you know the terrible experiences almost to the point where she blames 443 accusing her boyfriend of rape the journey to realize that what what she wants to see which is I'm you know look at me like a Survivor not a victim but it takes her the entire Journey when she let's go of that armor and she actually breaks down and in that weakness that was I didn't have pity for her I just had you know I was just happy that she finally came to terms with it and it was almost everything that happened so I think that it was also because I got that character which was written so beautifully by you know Ruchi and she had really it started moments was when she had that that you know that strong get up and you know talking with all those ballsy all of that but for me the strongest what is when she was almost vulnerable self and I think that was for me that was just that's when I was just having a good day to go off of 2 years back when I did and I remember it was getting steamed in one of the from Germany ended up asking me this question how is it possible you know I've seen I don't think I've seen many films where the protagonist is a female protagonist is so horny and he just couldn't he just couldn't like understand that how can this person be the protagonist of the film was so horny so that that's kind of I mean I was like okay maybe this is not the can or cannot be the character in close to me but my job is to make sure I do it with so much of honesty and vulnerability in the sense that I'm honest about is good and bad weekend strong moments of their characters like that I make it convincing enough for you to like her even in Bad Blood I'm going to chance to be men I was doing most of the things wrong in her life it has to be I need to be just so honest with my vulnerability I can I made a mistake yes I made a mistake I just have to be so honest about it that I make sure I make my audience like not so nice character I guess that's I think that's a true that we get this actors which is not a very you know commonly phenomenon on paperwork I mean you know it's beautiful it's beautiful for me to see Jessica you know like that and you know I had a chance to romance you know in a film but you know I wish I wish it was it in differently and maybe there will be more but it's great it's great that female it's great how to use the format of supernatural horror and Thriller to actually tell stories about the terrible how did that inform your performance do gravitate towards a role where you are noble but you're good because play you are pulling that person from inside of you and you're much happier to to ferret out niceties it is when you have to deal with in yourself to find the the person who hasn't had courage to find a not so attractive person that the becomes more difficult because as a professionally trained actor like a lot of I was saying I have been taught in Stannis is method that if I were the three words should be prefix to any character and I should be able play that character to Perfection now for me recognizing myself person who has a strong sense of self and a strong sense of being able to to take a stand necessary I have to go back to play a character who hasn't had the strength so I am time to find her from within myself but I also have to catch at people that I have seen in many who have had to take that so it is an amalgamation of the stimulus that is provided from my understanding of society from my my being able to be sensitive to that and also try and find her within myself because whatever it is until I am able to internalize it I am not going to be able to give a credible performance and that's why I said that in Satya it was it was in that sense a greater struggle it's very interesting I always say that you know enter inhabit the world of a character inhabiting in different ways times I open the window sometimes I walk right into the drawing room sometimes I sort of look at the and then close it and I think when I was playing Satya I didn't dare enter the drawing room how to look from Wood River to always you know tell me that you have to play a picture and you have to you know be comfortable playing a bichar who is the most difficult part for me I used to always feel very suffocated playing the 20 year old woman because she is a person almost like a puppet you know if the person standing in front of her tell her to you know talk she will talk if that person is expecting her to not talk she will not talk she won't even move without you know any instructions from her husband or from the family the most challenging bit I have cried and number of times in front of and you know I used to sometimes feel helpless how can a person be like this you know you should have your own you know desire how can you not have your own desires how can you not wish for anything how can you be so dependent on your own are your family member how can you be so alone that you don't have anybody who you can share your thoughts with or you know even have the thought very very difficult for me and on the other hand we were this girl the 25 year old boy the Transformers who is this powerful person and is Lord has a number of flaws but is confident about everything in life and is you know and doesn't shy away from taking a life and there were days when we were playing both bulbs together I had to you know go back from being a 20-year-old go to the 25-year-old which were completely different so those days particularly were very difficult but I have to you know if it was not her I don't think I would have you know done what I did in Google she was I think very very important for actors specially you know a new actor like me to have that connect with the director I want to ask all of you here what is the best piece of acting that you've seen this year it could be by definitely definitely prateek in oh my God it is such an incredibly incredibly Google I really think it's like a star is born kind of performance in in skam 1992 is just absolutely come back to me let me think stop it heavy duty question I agree I don't have an I'm still going through recap about all I've seen this year what is the best coming out hey Google single person that was unbelievable insane casting just beautiful people between I'm not getting into performances but I think to begin with I think it came certainly came more from Ott then it came from from feature but also I think for me between Delhi crime talk about the lock has been my absolutely crime was last year was last night I think of taking hits from everyone here the only series I haven't seen fully I think belly crying because I have visited that recently and that stayed with me for the longest so I guess all the key actors I think it's the least please because I can't think of anything listening last year's counter I can because I really seen anything this year I have not shot for a thing I haven't seen anything I've just been in hospitals so if it's last I mean the actors in those two shows made me just so happy that I am an actor you know and that and and that please I just saw some recently called arubi and I don't know she was outstanding and I was just I'm still standing so from suitable boy she has you know the in the previous question watching it what was it so that's that's his yeah so and then after my favorite was your beginning was my favorite performance America shooting after being away from set for many months do you find a change in yourself or in your app to work as you return to it after this first break has something changed fundamentally you want to say apart from the visual everyone wearing masks and some kind of kicks and looking like astronauts on set apart apart from that do I have to see the first shot I did when I got back to work which was recently which is last month why feeling really nervous also and I had this short but I was drinking tons of cranberry juice because I had to drink wine I said in spite of this I'm still happy to be here so it was a little awkward in the beginning because people didn't know on set when you come usually when we have to give each other hugs some people a little more paranoid than others on set and difficult to gauge who's more and who is less instantly so it's that little awkward few seconds when you meet people that you don't know what's the line that they have drawn so so yeah that was a little awkward in the beginning you can't you can't just run and go and hug people on set and shake hands apart from that it takes a little more time for the set to get ready in the shorts to change because if people want to just sanitize things as much as as an actor I don't I don't think much changes for me and then my visual as I said because you're not very much because of your makeup and everything so you end up being a little more like what you were before just that you have lesser number of people around why are you over everything right now and I was like I don't know because I'm constantly and I think maybe because even though but I think it's going to take it so it's fine but yeah I mean Everyone's an astronaut on set and everyone's just trying to it just feels like your your back I mean your back home when a safe environment trying to make it as safe as we can and stay safe and putting in a petition for people who Costco one more take what time we must work together one you know but it definitely gave us more time for prep and Rajiv if you remember and I only did we did our first interview together in the lockdown which is like way back in March or something and so it literally give us that entire whatever 5 months 6 months to actually better the script to better the character so we spent a lot of time doing that so in a way it kind of felt like a blessing in that sense you know because of the script was in one place and then 6 months later add so much more to it so I feel like it really what do you say marinated well and at the same time I think we and we've spoken about this earlier like there's a point where after a point you start feeling like you know you I feel the timing was right in terms of how much time we needed to play sort of 42 marinate we went to set and we started shooting so and that's when it's kind of just find all fell into place a lot more focused a lot time to work on on the on the character that you're working on primarily Dot film is doing but it's really you
