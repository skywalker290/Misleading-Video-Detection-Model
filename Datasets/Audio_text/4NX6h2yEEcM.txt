to have all of you here and I was nervous about talking to so how many people at the same time how in the world did you direct a film with this massive star cast did you ever think what are the most when they had this combination date everybody was on the said it was mad I was and I wish we had more combination dates and more really we used to hear that when there were two heroes in a film they would ask for a joint narration because obviously all of you are not doing this film for the footage right it's an ensemble cast you're not doing it because I don't know if I should be offended at this question because I've been around for 20 years I've never had a joint narration with another hero and I've got the maximum ensembles 90s music I promise you you don't remember that big story about Dad and and how they had to be a joint narration between I think it was Sunny MN Shahrukh Khan and I said about this a I actually had a very detailed narration with the with Dede he came to the to my office he sat down Oklahoma Michigan that can I come hear the story or I'll come to a costume you know what do you call it test then this test that does not actually because I know he used to cook food for the office I have to go to eat for that and in that job I got through that this is one track of this one guy just come out of jail and and he's trying to deal with the emotional I've actually you know the final product a couple of days ago I showed it to my dad I actually got to know that my character's name is Batu keshwar tiwari I was referred to as bit too so I said okay my name is bittu I don't even know my characters called but you can it's something about something you already know that It's Your Mother and Daddy and and the other food that you are sleeping I take me to Summit City the food was great on set though but I remember all of us going after pack up to Ronnie chai place he took us that I was in your story so that was midnight thing that we had that because so listen I might be creating more 79102 I'm not tell me that this film certifies description I would kind of Liberty to put a label I would say it's a it's a sort of absurdist tragedy of the the and the action is obviously not meant to be taken in a realistic way it's not it's not realism that you're trying to do that but the emotions are authentic you want us to care for these characters so what is the struggle of balancing I just have a request to the Netflix Team can be always do a news interview first cuz now we got to say it's an absurdist tragic comedy could someone what is absurdist tragic comedy but it sounds really intellectual yes yes that was my intention and all that absurdist tragic comedy and it's not it's not a difficult to that balance between going for really outlandish situations and there are plenty in this film but making those feelings feel true are you speaking there was no extra for to do that you just because what kind of character because when you when you have attempting started writing this kind of characters and story I think they drive the forward and we just go with the flow that's it there was no extra effort to trying to you know it was already that's how it happened it just actually I don't remember because you know it was written very quickly the whole structure and the film and all the stories 711 stories then I selected this for and it was just organic and free flow and cynicism out of the window and be more op and writing stories I think it becomes more people I think that's the only way I know you have put play stress on Dada right now to use big English words by the way he said he's using a digital thesaurus on the your expression is just Priceless how did you figure out what to look like when this naked man is hanging above your head dead Ashley told me being handled through the entire film stop YouTube no I mean are you he told me everything I mean every shot he had to kind of explain because I was I think I was equally nervous through the entire film because I just I just wasn't sure if I was good enough to be I just didn't know if I was doing the right thing or not so I and if he looked like he was okay or if he was if he walk you're right lead was cold and it was in the middle of the night before life yeah so it was very cold and it was in the middle of the night and he just told me that there is a dead body that's going to fall and it's going to fall twice so you have to give me that reaction and we tried a couple of things I think the first I want to be pretty good and it came out to be pretty funny I really enjoyed doing it too because after it got done I saw it and everyone that was very very happy about it but I don't necessarily know what he gave me as a direction as to how to react get directions there because you know sometimes Hindi full movie Peppa Pig come Connecticut Disney movies and accidentally looking at the bus and dragged the beginning on the school movie script I'm going to the National Memorial Outlook secrets you know Gordon's liquor and yet you find a way to make it new you know set the volume that is something interesting going on with him he's very Charming when how do you do this Pakistan hotel hotel half the script is in his head which which we've all heard about anurag so much he's a great when you're working with so many tracks and so many characters I'm not become confusing play that character what is that guy doing we didn't have to concern ourselves with any other story other than our own but I think if it'll be that burden of having to Grapple with the stories and only play with the director did you have a moment of confusion the two of you okay like what is my character's motivation for this be jammed on it be jammed on yes for the most most of the film I was just amazing used to kill it and sometimes he used to not use the he used to tell me that so much and it was refreshing because I think a lot and I tend to overthink about the characters that I'm playing but it was a refreshing change for the first time I was quite relaxed also clueless name so you only in the moment you're not Play the song with the larger picture yeah I honestly didn't have any idea how our story is going to pan out or how sometimes it's not it's it's he knows exactly what he wants from that character so there is Clarity is just tell me tell me about the staging of the climax when all of you are in in and it has another one of my favorite moments when your character the Google who's carrying you have to do it why did you decide to stage massive kind of blowout to song and what was it like for all of you to be doing it what was it like to do all of that there was a sense when we were on the set of the climax with that's one time where you felt like there's a culmination of a lot of the stories and you don't know where all I'm just doing whatever he's telling us and it was complete chaos and kind of reflected on our supposed to know what everyone else tell me why why the climax was against song is cereal the space you know and that's the reason you know the song is this is to create that you know it was decided to bring the post-production when you're shouting instructions box disorders out at you but to be very fair a lot of the actors didn't know that they were other actors climax weather like for when I shot the climax Rd and Sonia went there and that what time is it in and early and I thought they'd come to see the shooting but a lot of the time but that's exciting you know like like like like all these achieved and he gets I think his version off the expression that he wants as opposed to your manufactured version if you ask me if I was supposed I'll do a pre-programmed version of that if he's just barking that at you in the middle of the truck is going to be what is going on am I going to get thrown out of this film why is he give me where is pankaj who is pankaj what is this guy doing it's all very it's very I don't think I thought for half a day with Aldi in one passing short I had a beautiful what team is Raj but that never made it to the Final Cut I had two or three days work with pankaj at Best of we never had that one scene where everybody was together even that he shot separately right and the one thing that everybody asks which is one of the first questions I asked him when I came on to set for the first time is he where did you shoot this film where is it set and it's it sounds so delicious candy videos 90% we started on the 19th of October 2018 so you know it's been over and you don't and you just and you're like really so just goes to show that this man's vision is so since I'm never going to have so many actors in the same place again and I'm going to ask each one of you to give me one of the best practical advice you've got about acting and in addition advice play music again turn on YouTube music are you acting like this me dance music call Advice Mickey Mouse images I'm going to television host for 10 years now so I'm used to expressing myself cuz I know watch me on television and I have exaggerated expression and my body language is very like so I had to minimize all that and that I said you have to keep it very subtle and because otherwise on the it's going to be too much and sometimes you don't even have to do anything just feel it and it'll come on your face and it'll and that's something that I kept in My Mind as a month at 12:00 and I feel like it's really and it's something that I never no one's ever told me this and that is the first person to tell me this and it's really helped me play Justin Bieber economy Hotel call me dada it's not always important to prepare yourself before a film and it totally depends on the character that so it's really very important to sometimes just cancel cancel look for you two things of one that that he used to always tell us sleep to the direction for poly and I it was pretty similar because we were all kind of the two of us he was shooting together most of weather for one thing that I learned on the other kind of TAC is the 5w which is what where when who and why five things which we kind of always used to think about before getting into a scene one thing used to always say is that don't always have to move your facial muscles to 2 years react to to show an emotion like that was I had to come in and look at early she's doing something which upsets me and I was trying to be said in front of the camera I said I don't want to try just can't stand in front of the camera and I'll see if it's genuinely upsets you and I did that and he okay short and when I saw it on the fill my knee what he meant that was one that was one thing which I think it is most cherished treasured Mall which I spoke about even during the trailer launch which is I was that is not that is not the one who would give you a lot of feedback on set because he knows that you know you're there for a reason you're there but I have someone who I feel motivated when I'm told that I'm doing a good job I used to keep asking him for a feedback and I used to keep asking him what is it that I can do better exercise with me very randomly they are the blue on set of sitting next to him on the Monitor and the shop was getting ready we sat together and I was asking him what is it that I can do better he took my ID card that I was wearing as Rahul and and I told him and I said I couldn't find it he said ok Google he said now look for it again for it but again couldn't find it you just got up and walked off and I ran behind is there a never rooted but you believe that it was there so you you did it without you believed in play something that I've always thought of whenever I've been nervous and said after that so yeah these are two things that I go back with me and I fully fully championship Connie you know that I think is is very important another advice which is great on more technical aspect my father gave me this is don't forget to process what's the time like like you saying it's so busy this off to get when somebody saying something to us then think about what you're going to say and then say it so don't forget to process and as far as the two things which I feel very important from from from from the other point of view I'm feeling a bit left in the cold cuz she never really orange hotel is great stories what are the few directors who after the show you just walks off so it's not something that you've done well when you walk either which way and I think that also is by Design because there is the next shot you give me that that much more so it's okay sleep without saying anything well and I would look at each other and bye baby you guys have just been told to wrap so thank you so much
