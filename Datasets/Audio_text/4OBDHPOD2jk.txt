RPG protagonist. like every RPG protagonist he gets accused for assaulting a molester wait a minute that's the last thing that probably happens to. play RPG protagonist so maybe Wren is in a class of his own though it's not entirely his fault you try to go up against someone who has high. will Authority even if you didn't do anything wrong it's going to spell bad luck for you also it's important to know that Ren is the leader of a vigilante group known. play Phantom thieves but we'll get into that later for now this false accusation causes run and his family to move to Tokyo and while in Tokyo. when discovers a strange app on a smartphone on a space memes which is free to download for Android and iOS devices and published by yours truly. well actually that's a lie the real app on his phone is. nothing like space means it's way worse this real app is a gateway to a parallel reality called the metaverse see I told you space memes was better. reality is the manifestation of an individual's Twisted desires into a dream like fantasy. morbid curiosity but then he realized people like coach kamoshida saw himself as a king who treated everyone else. and awakens his Persona which eventually leads us to a tuxedo. costume of Batman type nickname of the Joker so that was a very quick and watered-down version of Joker's origin but what about the Phantom. business and as well as his powers and abilities the Phantom thieves are a group of Vigilantes devoted to stealing the cropped Hearts of Evil people. what's the change in reform Society for the better so technically they are stealing something what they're stealing is something no one should possess Ren. power is having the ability to summon his Persona a Persona is kind of like what it sounds like it's a spirit of Legend with specific personalities. situational irony or not the Joker's Persona is the wildcard Persona which means runs. personas with different abilities and skills some of these include Vishnu which is immune to light and darkness. goddess of love Mother Harlot based on the horror of baby. based on the god of Swords Metatron the ultimate Persona of justice and many more Reynolds as a third. play that allows him to spot hidden secrets evidences Footprints as well as the ability to see how strong an enemy is as for a standard equipment Joker usually carries. a powerful pistol forged from Lucifer he also has a special armor for. and of course there's the omnipotent orb this orb has the ability to render all incoming. Nolan Boyd but not every single type of attack that would be a No Limit fallacy there is the exception of Almighty attacks which can harm the ore as well as. as for weaknesses Joker usually fights alongside other teammates while he can hold his own he's going up against the Joker who is amazing. Joker is pretty skilled at working around those things and while he. he's facing a fully grown man in this episode now the best way to end the Joker segment is with a joke but I'm not going to do. I'm going to show you a cringey meme. in nearly every Incarnation The Joker is highly intelligent. is his Joker venom sometimes referred to as Joker juice a deadly poison that infects his victims with. Joker also has a trustee jetpack to. is the fact that he is human and like any human he can be put down with enough force and sure he can take. how much more damage than most humans but like all humans he will eventually die if you beat him hard enough. now let's get ready for the fight this battle will take place on Earth and remember there is. no prep time let the battle begin. baby you better than me they call me the jok. what is this a joke. now get ready for the Post analysis and I'd like to thank Fenton Missouri for providing the research and notes for the Post analysis. thanks and enjoy so the. what is actually on you because in the beginning of this video I told you that joker was going to win but in reality I lie since it was Joker who won all along. The Joker The Joker can scale to Batman who is. in short bursts though Ren however can Dodge. bass attacks and lightning bolts dodging electricity easily puts renz reaction speeds at massively Hypersonic this speed Edge is going to. Joker's punches bullets laughing gas and much more is likely never going to touch ran if both are fighting. the god of control and the controller of the metaverse which holds multiple. this includes any palaces and infiltrated the Velvet room including any and all of the Palaces it's also important to note that. one of the Palaces there's an entire sun inside of it so even if we lowball defeating this dude it's still going to allow rent. Grizzly defeat some clown from Gotham City no I don't want to downplay the Joker he's not just some clown he is quite skilled. top tier type of Joker like Emperor Joker a regular Joker is kind of. joke to Joker from Persona know I could go more in-depth but doing so will only add salt to the wound the. I may have fun fighting billionaires in spandex but when it comes to fighting a clown who doesn't clown around I guess you can say that this is real killing. now if you want to see a rematch with Emperor Joker one of the most OP versions of the. don't forget to comment on your. ideas and stay tuned as the next Fighters are going to be revealed on the next episode of cartoon. stop. what's up everyone welcome to the 67th episode of cartoon Fight Club. tonight's episode is being animated by one of my real good. subscribe speak. comic book villains Gotham's Joker. what is Joker is really Batman's butler Alfred pennyworth think about it. I'm too busy ripping off all jokes aside let's get back to the cannon Source material. in nearly every Incarnation The Joker is highly intelligent and skilled in the fields of chemistry and Engineering as well as. sometimes referred to as. is first appearance the Joker's immune to his Venom and the Venom is so powerful it could even take down Superman. original mode of transportation was. believe it or not. Norman Osborne was experimenting with. and he became the original Green Goblin even before. mathematics and science. Goblin glider. dissociative identity disorder. is increased mental instability causes him to sometimes be extremely impulsive not thinking before plugging into a. play dangerous situation making it relatively easy to lure him into traps overall the Green Goblin has. I'm having a bad day I'm sick of people trying to shoot me run me over and. pause. I'm going to destroy. this battle was over before it started. don't look so serious smile. is spoiled my phone. you're not as much of a challenge as I thought. well it looks like Joker had the last laugh now before I discuss why the Goblin. subscribe. the debate between Joker and Green Goblin is no walk in the park both. Green Goblins gas is something that he'd be okay with passing. get it passing no all right sorry but that's only one of the reasons why Joker ends up losing. Goblin can lift up to 20 tons or 40,000 lbs while the Joker only has the strength of an average human. Joker's 20th century jetpack is a literal joke compared to the high-tech Goblin glider but the best part about. Spider-Man the same Spider-Man. one shot a T-Rex and you can also lift 20,000 lbs the Green Goblin is completely safe from jok. 51 year old. Goblin dissociative identity disorder the only problem is that Goblin armor is so durable there's just not much. one direct pumpkin bomb to the face to blow Joker's human head off and kill him and getting a good hit or stabbed on Joker is. easy task and will take a ton of effort and time but it's something completely doable for the Green Goblin now instead of. record Batman versus the Green Goblin in Spider-Man you know what to do comment down below the word rematch. they may even become a future episode of cartoon. hey Google hey Google.
