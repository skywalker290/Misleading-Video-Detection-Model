I've been meaning to make this video for a while actually somehow I didn't realise that this had even happened and then I hadn't updated you guys I've had some findings some some adjustments to my life and I think you might want to know about him so I mean you probably what channel is video you kind of know what it's about on the left-hand side here I have the 13-in MacBook Air over here is the ThinkPad X1 carbon now when this laptop came out I made a very complimentary video about it the best laptop for most people that was can you and based on that evaluation at that moment it seems like a really good buy for a lot of people especially considering it's starting raise the build quality the association with the Apple brand for a lot of people so I called it that but I ran into problems with this shortly after publishing a video in fact I kind of felt guilty having called laptop the best purchase for most people so I came on here and I showed you guys that the keyboard was not functioning as expected I had problems with the icky Jack has a MacBook Pro Kirk has a MacBook Pro and Will has a MacBook Pro and I do the e key starts to give out then I kind of put it down and went back to using the MacBook Pro then I come into work and will tell me his put frozen now exhibiting the same thing that this one was then the email start to roll in for me of other people having experienced the same and I was like man I think this issue is bigger than I had ever expected and the Guilt started to pile up for me maybe I should be people will Apple fix it presumably but if this happens to you after your warranty expires that could be a very how to fix and this is not an inexpensive laptop when that happened it kind of reconfigured my brain a little bit and I was like man I've been using Apple laptops exclusively for a very long time almost 10 years and I was like I should go back to windows and see what's happening in Windows search for some Windows based devices that I might actually like so that took me down to ThinkPad path and guess what I loved it back to Windows without much fanfare obviously without telling you guys officially and I'm not missing it it's kind of flipped version of that add campaign from back in the day when you got the guy who's the Mack and the guy who's the PC and the one I'm going the other direction this became my main laptop X1 carbon good battery life surprisingly I I Began to really like the matte display without the the glare and the infer backpack on this ThinkPad when compared to the MacBook I lived with the bizarre button placement I lived with the location of the fingerprint scanner live with all that stuff and I did so because when I got to type on this beautiful keyboard you see how Vanna white I just I come across it when I typed on this keyboard I had a sense of euphoria in epiphany of swords that I was like man I've been missing out there are great laptop keyboards out there I'm talking about the actual experience having used this even if this thing was completely functioning correctly I would trade it in a second for this experience this thing lights me to answer emails and nothing does ever I never want to look at email but here it's a pleasure brightness battery life things like this but now we look at a product like this it's like cheese it's bar thicker it's lighter in fact with a bigger display 14 inch display 2 1/2 lb 13 in play 3 lb pretty much as thin light weigh more interface capacity Harry type c to breakout ethernet USB there's an HDMI port another USB port headphone jack SIM card slot you could enable this device for 4 mobile connectivity along with a SIM card and a connection through your carrier so you're always connected it can be it always on mobile what's the biggest thing was Windows itself I went with like the simplest set up ever that I can show Jack here I took the number of apps that I use like on a relatively frequent basis and made them nice and small I pinned them and then most what else I do just lives within the Chrome browser right there and via tabs I mean this thing is so clean that's basically what I interact with my daily life cup of coffee over here maybe it's over here and checking you know a couple of different I mean it's Windows guys what do you what do you really need it got prettier it really did it's not like it used to be it's reliable it's smoother it's better looking I turned off most of the system based notifications that I didn't need so they're less ABR products a long time ago because they are valid snooze for what apple is doing now I should say that these two devices are not necessarily targeted at the same clientele I think most people are this thing looks prettier of course myself I like the industrial appearance of the ThinkPad the smudges on alumin I have to admit it looks great but I was surprised I enjoyed the switch and I'm actually quite happy to be in the Windows space now and have the wide variety of laptops to choose from what is a laptop for most of us these days what do you really need here what are you paying for durability form Factor you need something that's light you need something that has good battery life and then after it's a keyboard and a display so ask yourself how good are those components and I can pretty safely say not just based on my experience but also on the reliability factor that these keyboards on the macbooks are flawed and that is a major if not the most component in a laptop it's a reason to pick up a laptop when compared to a phone or a tablet or some other device that you have if you do this experiment yourself if you move over to a keyboard like the one on the X1 carbon you will never want to touch or tap anything like this I have officially quit using Apple laptops and it kind of happened quietly I didn't even really expect that I didn't even really set out to do it but I'm living
