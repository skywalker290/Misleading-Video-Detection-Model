hey what's up guys and these are the new airpods pro could you tell the difference airpods on their site yesterday and I've been using them for about a day pretty nice now these cost competing with some other really nice headphones at what's so pro about these new airpods Pro update everything that's new first of all the new design so you can see them here they're a little bit smaller and they have a shorter stem and they kind of like that one Pok√©mon or maybe a hair dryer or maybe even Pingu man the internet is fast to me these new Apple product more reasonable looking more compact we've seen how weird these types headphones can get with stuff like the Microsoft Surface buds I think this is an improvement actually wish they came in more colours and that actually was one of the rumours that there might be black pear and as hard as they would be defined if you lost them I still would have liked to have seen that but you still have gloss now again for your in-ear headphones but they are now officially ipx4 rated for water resistance so that's good for ipx4 and there's of course the three different size rubber tips total the mediums are attached out the box and they have a smaller I just being near your iPhone and opening the case and then you get this little tutorial on how to use these new airpods Pro and with this tutorial as you media controls reading you your messages out loud with Siri and iOS 13.2 and noise airpods pro do you have active noise cancellation and this is a rumor that I was sort of on the fence about noise isolation that comes with any pair of earbuds that make it seal in your ear this uses the phones and the earbuds themselves to do active additional noise cancellation in earbuds and this is just my first impression cancellation is pretty decent I'd say it's about on par if you get a good seal with the beats Solo pro that I've been which are on your headphones I mean they're honestly better than I expected from any sort of earbuds I don't use many noise cancelling earbuds not sure I find Rhythm on a plane they're not that good but hey maybe some testing will change my mind and time for when I do the full review The earbuds them have you seen have this larger black grill on the sides and that's where are to pass through so even when you're wearing them with the in-ear you can still hear sounds and you don't feel like you're all clogged up when you normally wear earbuds because of that are pass through so that's pretty cool turn on the noise cancellation a bunch of different ways you can flip it on in the settings in IOS 13.2 with that volume or you can squeeze the stem which is now pressure sensitive for about a second activate noise cancellation or you can even activate it from your watch if you want to either way you'll hear a chime and it kicks in and it's this good noise cancellation without that vacuum feeling thanks for the air pass through there's even built into iOS this little thing does the magic what about called the ear tip fit test and you can open it and run through it it'll play a short sound into your ear use the microphones inside airpods pro to determine if you have a good fit or not a good seal if you don't it'll tell you either one or both of them you need to adjust the size of the rubber tips you have on for a better seal and then you can get them right I haven't seen that anywhere before these are new drivers with the noise cancellation on they sound better and without the noise cancellation they sound ok you know I'm going to give much more detailed feed for it the full review and I'll compare them to other earbuds and things in the price range but for now not bad but of course can't forget last but not least the new case the case itself is actually a little bigger a little bit wider mostly than previous airpods case but nothing too drastic it's almost like you turn the old one sideways and then stretch that a little bit but it's still has wireless charging Gen 2 still very pocketable and still gives you that quick charging and 24 hours of total battery life and it's you're still lightning not that I expected USB type-c for every apple pro product but yeah still lightning but that is pretty much everything that's new with a brand new airpods pro why are they called the pro I don't know it's just kind of like everything that's high-end is just called usb-c or higher frustrator multiple colours are not I know for a fact there's no audio engineers waiting is airpods pro NFC does but those are the new features and so far seems like a pretty complete package but I think in theory this what my biggest problem was with the previous airpods which is they didn't sound great but they also fell out of my ear instantly airpods right 5 yards of running so in theory these new ones solve that problem for me by having this little rubber tip they're not going to fall out of my ears easily and they're going to sound better and that's definitely good to see let me know are you into these are you into this I mean this weird silent announcement they did with airpods you're on the site now they're available today or tomorrow I believe you can get them in stores October 30th and they look a little different but same more expensive and some more features the cancellations actually pretty impressive definitely stay tuned for the full review for sound play all of my thoughts and let me know if you have any questions or comments down below what you want to see in the full review and subscribe to be among the first to see it if you
