forth creators have to do with the concerned authorities to lend authenticity who won the big screen you realize that even fictional stories come with the responsibility the lack of structure in the 80s and 90s and the absence of everybody is like too many embarrassing portrayals of people in the armed forces that would never fly today I remember talking about the 1992 film Once Upon a Time on this channel for It's Over the Top dictator Village and the bizarre plot that their introduction is often scaling a wall just guess for what it needs excitement what does they have to make the most of their creepy Antics so what do they do they cross dresses women put on some swimsuits and jump cold weather do you know of course Copperfield and say the creepiest lines possible who won the quantity the concept of consent in a movie like the Hellcat is just a glimmer of an ongoing problem regarding Hindi films and trailer of relationships look at this sequence of java jafri getting into a scuffle with a female intelligence agent from another country master your opinion always gets clouded regarding his choice of films and maybe even the socially problematic messaging while I'm responsible to point out the charity obvious irresponsible messaging in Shahid Kapoor film like Kabir Singh or even the underwhelming quality of a film like I've always been criticized for not being harsh which I should have been somehow I've always rooted for this guy maybe it's because what is phones in my formative years maybe because I connect to him as a dancer especially that being said it becomes My Prerogative to call out something it's horrible and my God R Rajkumar is horrible I really want this phone just to understand how bad it truly is and then it's music which I will always stand by I have to see it made me uncomfortable in prints through most Parts Romeo constantly stocks annoyed with his persistence she slaps him only for Romeo to give up back on her hand she mocks him for his height he berates her for play Kiki please sneaks into a house at night as she is changing and all this leads to the girl falling in love for him even the hero creepy dialogues guaranteeing that she

stopped by Vijay and see these dialogues to him again are you a girl who he has sexually assaulted he consults her and takes her away and you want to know the most bizarre aspect of the movie though guess what is the very next scene Daddy honestly Matlock I can't even say goodbye this is so disturbing the same Preposterous thought of marrying your ab The Rascals you know you would wonder that is the years go by the directors who is specially popular in the 90s would evolve with times in mold the storytelling in characters with respect to the social climate of today One Direction despite the Evergreen nature of his comedies that refuses to budge from the archaic and regressive stereotypes is David Dawson the biggest case study regarding this statement is a a film about two men trying to manipulate an affluent girl in order to access to what is a tone deaf and horrible comedy were the two actors constantly group harass undress molest and even you almost start feeling bad for Gangnam in this film to be subjected to such disturbing buffoonery but I guess she Home Depot in comedy will be funny it isn't the film mock Starving Children of Africa and even the visually impaired you can pretend to be blind only to group kangana whenever he possibly can he picks her up and throws her down under the guise of teaching herself threatens to kill himself if she doesn't love him make sure

her bikini top when will test your patience intelligence as well as mental health and is all kinds of wrong they just funny Destiny is a film but a man brutally rapes a woman as his friend group cheers on Yes you heard that right this is a film I spoke about portrayal of violence against women to titillate the audience rather than contribute artistically when I explored this movie further I was blown what is the pragmatic course of action of the protagonist a noble police officer played by vijayashanthi when the case against the politician false flag the course of action the police officer thinks fit is to make sure the victim gets married to the abuser this is the turn off her parents when in order to pacify the girl's family the abuses except the proposal hey Google this is the statement of the son who is being forced into this Union just remember he is the abuser so what do you do they make sure as the victim is arriving for her wedding that she goes up in flames and dies surprisingly the girl perseveres from all injuries and the police officers still wants this Union to happen Roman man and his rant about the oblivious Indian public which by the way is still true
