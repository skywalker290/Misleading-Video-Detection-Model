all right this is a funny-looking box would you look like what they're going for something way different here this my friends the xl4 from Blu smartphones you probably won't believe it but this is the best selling locked smartphone on Amazon I looked this up and I was like I need to investigate why is it this one what's so special about of course it has a very attractive price it's around $150 so I ordered it up it just showed up that the spec list on the back here on this crazy box 6.2 inch HD plus 19 by 9 display bizarre resolution 720 * 1500 for a 271 PPI not the highest resolution display that's for sure P22 processor in their 32 gigs of internal memory 3 gigs of RAM 13 + 2 megapixel main camera 13 megapixel selfie camera micro SD expansion of course 4G LTE built-in and a 4,000 milliamp hour battery also a fingerprint scanner now that doesn't sound that redmi Note 7 we're talking about the Samsung Galaxy M stop so this 5 minutes heating up but for now at least in the United States in North America this is one of your few options for an lock device with relatively modern specs at this particular price point 150 bucks so let's open this up let's see what we're working with Android 8.1 Oreo as well if you're interested so we are met with the device you can see it has a notch design that's right you want to get in on the notch party you're in timer for 450 bucks the fingerprint scanners on the back there I love this spot I became so accustomed to it this location for the fingerprint scanner is just natural it's right there it's convenient it does the job you can see the camera unit up in this region here dual camera setup I'm wondering if this is speaker of course will find out otherwise a pretty familiar setup you have a power switch volume rocker above that there is headphone jack I think this is an imperative feature at the lower price points like 150 bucks you got to have one of these SIM card and then that's about it unfortunately you're looking at micro USB no USB type-c love here 50 bucks how much complaining do you want to do about that I guess like I said if you're looking at one of those new red meat device maybe you want to do a lot of complaining but nonetheless that's the status of this one at the moment also in the package extras we have the power brick we have the USB cable they're going to give you a headset a wired headset oh my goodness haven't seen one of those in a box in a while they're going to you some silica gel for Jack that's been a minute also a SIM card tool which gets its own plastic bag a sticker holy smokes this is comprehensive two cases what that's crazy what is it when you spend less you get more you know you don't always give me cases on smartphone they're like nah you got enough money 150 bucks that like take a case it's on the house this is just your standard absolute funky town as Willie do would say holy smokes look at that a tempered glass screen protector as well included in the price here's a phone let's get the plastic peeled off here all right let's put this up and see what blue is all about bold bold like us Jack you missed it you're too late oh bit of a laggy animation bolt like us not terrible but the look of it the display is a bit vibrant if you if you get real close you can tell I guess you can see some pixels installing a bunch of 8.1 a couple of unusual things I mean they put opera on their out of the box and next radio but how does that compare to bloat on other devices it's not terrible wait a minute they put Prime what else do they put on here by default blue help data clone I mean obviously you I won't use most of this stuff but you're going to get a couple of things like it's not going to be a completely stock experience obviously okay we get that so this this is what it's going to look like with the notch off now since it's an LCD you can kind of see where atone is there unfortunately it pushes down your time and various other icons instead of leaving them up in that extra real estate so this is not my favorite implementation but it's 150 bucks remember remember the price point like there you go 1 + 16 all right there's a notch here what is a small one but as you can see you can fill the header with all your various icons that you would normally want to see your battery I need your time and so on so that's the ideal implementation anyhow today where is firing from it's on the back there it is you can cover that accidentally not the best location one thing I it's pretty tinny not that I had not that I had high expectations for it but nonetheless get the little plants it's not the sharpest to my eyeballs compared to what I'm typically testing here on Flagship devices I mean it's not in the same territory not that I expected to face beauty so is Jack's favorite moment here smoother whitening slimming iron larger are you ready we're going to maximum all out okay well that's oh my God this is what people are looking for this is it this is a glimpse into the future what is that who is that is that a human barely do we have some beard hairs it's not terrible you know what it might be better by comparison to other front facing images and then the rear camera was turn on the plant their look guys it's going to be a little bit of a little bit of everything that you need at 150 unlocked and it's a thing that's readily available and will work on your North American Network you're just going to slap you're going to have a headphone jack you're going to be okay you're going to be all right the hard thing here is to compare this to the type of stuff we're seeing coming out he knows emerging markets at price points like this that are probably going to be a is there are a few steps better in the meantime a decent package the something that will get the job done for you looking at this thing if I add to decide what what the biggest drawback was it's probably that processor you know it's a bit laggy here and there and possibly the camera display I feel like I could get used to the notch I could live with it's got a 4000 milliamp hour battery that's another plus right there there are other players domestically I know Motorola they play in this kind of price point as well but none this is the champ this is the one that that one out this is the current best selling result on amazon.com so you let me know what you think if you had 150 bucks to spend on a smartphone what would your choice be this or something else
