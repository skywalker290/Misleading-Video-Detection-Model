so today we have a new guest on the show his name is Rajeev masam he's a film critic I have been following his work for the last 15 years and you must TV show now showing so I'm a big fan and it's a privilege to have him on the show so over to Rajiv for a few recommendations how do you like watching films I thought I'd choose a team and the thing that I've chosen is loneliness or isolation the first film change recommend today is somewhere by Sofia Coppola it was made in the year 2010 and it's really one of my favorite films because represents the theme of of loneliness in a very interesting manner what's very important is the setting I think in films about and in this case the location is the Chateau Marmont which is one of the most exclusive hotels in Los Angeles in Hollywood on the story is about this movie star Johnny Johnny Marco Stephen Dorff please he's moved into the Chateau Marmont if you've been to Los Angeles you'll see it's one of those hotels that not everyone has access to is the place where movie stars and famous people go to just to genuinely hide from the public he is at that stage in his life he has a young daughter who comes to live with him but he's spending his days mostly just smoking or drinking I'm having sex with whatever woman shows up and and I'm pretty much throws herself with him and you can see that this is is loneliness it is Hollywood royalty she's the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola she knows this world she knows the word of movie star she knows what goes on in James and hearts it's interesting because he's in Hollywood which is the most glamorous city in the world he's in a hotel that's buzzing with with activity it's the shot of a Ferrari that's just going around in circles and that's representative of where he is in his life bored is he lonely possibly all of those things there's another shot in the film there's nothing in the film which also symbolizes the the loneliness that he feels he has to go into a studio to do a mold of his face because is he going to be playing in older character and older person and they put the plaster on him and his entire face is covered in plaster except Australia because that's what he needs to breathe and they leave him because they you know the technicians go after the whatever else they need to do and he's just in the room with plaster on him is covered mouth covered only nostrils and the camera very very very very slowly kind of you know moves closer and closer also Sofia Coppola there is this bit where he goes to Italy because he's going to be receiving an award and he's sitting in a in a crowded Auditorium and they're all talking 1000 of people and still to be all alone the only time that loneliness is sort of broken is when he's with his 11 year old daughter Chloe play by Elle Fanning and she's she's a lovely young actress because she's so perceptive it's just her face she doesn't say a lot in fact that's true of the entire film you're not a lot of dialogue so much of it is just it's just what you watch that a long chunks where he's just smoking or just drinking or he's eating spaghetti that is cooked himself in the room it's a kind of thing that a lot of people would immediately says this is a slow film but I think the beauty is in the slowness the second film I want to talk about is Lars and the Real Girl Lars and the Real Girl is a 2007 film how old is Ryan Gosling again what's very important to note right away is the setting is the location it's one of those clothes in the communities where everyone he's the protagonist of this this 27-year-old man that Ryan Gosling plays he's a when we meet him initially you realize he's someone who's who's socially awkward who really wants to be by himself he's someone chooses to be by himself he lives in the garage that is just buy the home that his brother and his sister-in-law live in play by Emily Mortimer and she's lovely and she wants to spend more time with him and they keep calling him home for breakfast and for dinner but but he's not comfortable he just he would just rather be alone and he lives in that garage we see that he goes to work but he's not particularly a box arrives big big box arrives by delivery and good evening he comes home he comes to his brother's house and he tells them that I got a visitor and and they're very excited because it seems like like he's he's can you engage and that's when you first meet Bianca and Bianca is a mail order doll what you know what most men order for for sexual purposes she's a sex doll or a love doll and I'm not seeing that that that that first scene where there where he's sitting there with the doll and they provocative clothes she's dressed and very provocative clothes she's been delivered and and she's sitting there on the sofa because he's brought her and just that image of his go and his sister-in-law in utter disbelief looking there and and watching him go about his business I think it's the first did you realize that that this is a man who is Disturbed he's clearly you know he clearly has mental health issues that's the first time you is it and that's the first time that they articulated the the brother and sister-in-law and what's really beautiful about this film is that of course songs from loneliness of course that stems from you know from from from I wouldn't say Outkast because he chooses to be a outside of the Social Circle but but if it comes from a place of loneliness and later we discovered that the loneliness comes from comes from childhood my sister-in-law sort of embrace Embrace him with that with that girlfriend with Bianca how they treat her like a Embraces her and unacceptable as as as as a human and it's beautiful because you realize the extent that one will go to for the sake of people wish that the world was in fact so kind and gentle and EMP I suppose everyone has watched its Revolutionary Road which was by Sam Mendes in the year 2008 it's got Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet playing a Suburban couple sub American couple the wheelers this is a film that's not on you know immediately you wouldn't say this is a film about loneliness but it is about just in a marriage certainly from her point of view and that's why I picked it the story is of course about this couple about 8 or 9 years into the marriage and this couple finds himself at a place in their lives that they didn't expect to be they both you know both of them thought they'd be in different place in a job in the city selling machines it's the job that he vowed he wouldn't take because his father worked for the same company so he is clearly detached he's someone who's immersing himself in drink and you know casual sexy play hooks up with the with someone from the typing pool in the office this is the 50s I think it's set in and meanwhile The Escapist when does the track that I find a really fascinating because she's a woman whose you know who's at home and she's she's lonely both literally and metaphorically because he's away most of the day working in the city she's alone she crosses the road to take the trash out and she looks at their home and and there's a flashback the time that they first came to look at the Home in the first sort of set the hearts on buying this home that was a very different time because because was the most important thing it represented hope it represented love but Loan in this marriage he's clearly you know too busy to disconnected and we know because we see what's going on in his life simultaneously but I think it's one of those absolutely incredible films about the breakdown of a relationship about the breakdown of and again you see you see the loneliness in the second half of the film when she makes that crucial decision I'm not going to give away but and you realize just where she is has just where she was in her head and in her heart I absolutely love Revolutionary Road it's a it's a film that really takes a piece out of you I find that characters that are in that place is fascinating characters because to be in the modern world or or you know any any point I mean the world is populated and to be around people I'm yet to feel so disconnected you know it's it's it's it's it's it's it's heartbreaking and it's it just makes for very very compelling viewing the fourth film I want to talk about is not actually about loneliness but I'll tell you why I still think it fits with the I think it was directed the year right after Revolutionary Road which is interesting because add cynical and as heartbreaking as that film was this is life of forming this is a film about a about a young couple early 30s they played by John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph the young couple who are expecting their first baby they live in a small turn on it's a it's a cool small town I don't think we ever learn where but they live close to his parents because when they realize that they're going to have a baby they feel that this is the best you know it'll be nice to have the grandparents influence and then how about early on that the grandparents actually have planned to move they're moving to Antwerp and and now and now their plan to to have the grandparents influence on their first child is not going to be there so now they decide that that that we need to we need to find the right place to raise so it's about actually not raising their child in loneliness and isolation they have the option to raise the child where they live when it's interesting because these are two characters these are two people who are you know they're they're happy go lucky they're young they don't have a lot of money open jobs which doesn't require them to go to the office they work from their homes all they really have is each other and love they don't have a lot of money at one point and she says at one point that you know they're really Bohemian kind of people but when the when a couple but when the kid is arriving they realize that that is something especially him he's someone who do both of them want to give the child I want to raise the child in the best place possible around the best influences I really really I really enjoyed a baby and it's really interesting because Sam and just made it the year after Revolutionary Road which in fact was shortly after Revolutionary Road Sam Mendes his own marriage to Kate Winston broke up and it talks about you know this was married Princeton and then he made this sort of Life of opposite sides of of the coin because one is a film about the break he's out on which one is better I used to love away we go and I used to feel that way because a much more underrated film and that I love it a lot more than revolutionary and for this for this podcast I watched all these films again do I have to say I'm going to go back and say I I think Revolutionary Road is the is the one that takes the peace out if you would really is the one that's that that's a stronger film and that's the one that broke my heart the 5th and the last film that I'm going to talk to you about and I'm going with the theme of loneliness is one of my favorite film and I think it's only fair to pick an Indian film the film I want to talk to you about is a Marathi film called Killa Killa has been directed by Avinash Arun is it in the year 2015 and it's just one of those incredible films I remember when I reviewed the film I give it it's the story of a young boy who who moves with his mother from Pune to a small town on the pumpkin in the konkan regional coastal town in the konkan region because his mother has been transferred and he has to move with her but it's a very small still struggling to come to terms with the death of his father a year ago his father died so it's a it's a tricky time for a young boy he's only he has to go to a new school he has to adjust the new surroundings and he's just not able to adjust and I think that's something that a lot of us can relate to and and you know that feeling of walking into a classroom and and being completely petrified because you don't know anybody and you're feeling like you're being judged that's something that anybody can relate to he doesn't know a single person in that in that class and he doesn't want to go to that school and he's he's acting out against his snaps at his mother couldn't he he complains about her cooking is route to the neighbors he's just someone who doesn't want that life is he wants to reject that life but he understands that there is something that's that's the the she's such a fine actor has to do so little to convey so much and the actor is the other who is just I mean he he he he he he was much younger of course his mother against I'm getting old very fast but I remember is how a film made me feel and I think that that's how I remember what I what you know how much I love a film or not I remember how it made me feel and I remember walking out of killer feeling completely overwhelmed because I felt like I'd seen something very very honest and very very real it didn't feel like there was a single there was nothing that was done for for film for the camera this was the film that I remember making me feel pretty much the same way bonded which is another film about about loneliness and isolation Iran is one of my favorite films ever the feeling of that young boy turn on office boarding school and he goes back to his father's home and discovers that he has a young brother but you know everything about her and I don't need to talk about Uranus it's another thing these are two films of Iran and killed that I remember distinctly the feeling of when I left at cinema it's one of those things that stayed with me much much longer I I sometimes wonder what it is about about isolation and loneliness that that draws me into it but I think that it's what's I said it's it's it's a feeling and I think that a lot of films say a lot and and it's beautiful when I mean I find it really interesting when the film draws me in just purely Based On A Feeling on an emotion and that's why I picked these five films on the loneliness and isolation I love what's happening at chalchitra talks I love the YouTube channel because I think that it's just such an interesting it's such mute service to anyone that loves the movies a lot of the a lot of the times I may have watched some of the films that are being recommended either by the above or by I guess but but it's about watching it's about looking at a film and and really looking at a film Through The Eyes of the person that's that's talking about them and through 10 person who has meant so much and for that reason I think that what the fox is doing is incredible more power up I know that I'm I'm a fan for life
