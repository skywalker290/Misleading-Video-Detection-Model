tree four Armor of God while attempting to jump from call toward a branch Chan landed hard and in the process his skull collided with a rock this pushed some bone into which required surgery to remove everyone's favorite martial artist still has a hole in his head though it has been filled with brain damage although he did think starring in the rush hour sequels was a good idea number nine Isla Fisher Now You See Me Angela remember when a skateboard just and magician Henley Reeves pretends to be stuck in a tank of water as piranhas pour in at 10 well it turns out pretend will you be stuck and actually being stuck look very similar during the filming of this actress Isla Fisher banged on the glass to tell the cast and crew she was stuck but since that's what her character was supposed to do no one thought much of it thankfully she managed to free herself in time practical effects I don't need to be this real how about a little movie Magic number eight Kate Winslet Titanic few things are scarier than a drowning incident while Viggo mortensen's near drowning in a river during filming of The Lord of the Rings was harrowing imagine having during the Titanic scene in question Kate Winslet caught her coat on a gate James Cameron continues to dismiss the idea that she was in claiming they only let her think she was going to drown he also claims to know what he's talking about because he's almost drowned on many occasions okay let's put this incident aside for a second and ask ourselves why does James Cameron keep nearly drowning number seven Jaimie Alexander Thor the

realms protector of the nine rounds number six Michael J fox Back to the Future Part 3 go back to the future series isn't known for its realism the time traveling car and flying skateboards ruin that yet one scene of the trilogy was all too real for lead J fox in the series final installment Marty McFly is captured by Bandits and hung News until the dock rescues him if McFly squirming looks genuine it's because the actor really was being hung he even passed out for half a minute before he was saved but it's good to see you Marty number five Johnny Depp The Lone Ranger greetings Noble The Lone Ranger already had to suffer being pinned by audiences and critics of the but imagine how much hate it would have received if it had been the cause of Johnny Depp's demise during one horseback

missed his head meaning the world's sexiest hipster received only minor wounds from the fall something and the only thing the film did any permanent damage to was his career number four Jason Statham The Expendables you'd feel pretty safe hanging out with the Terminator Rambo and the Old Spice power guy wouldn't you came in this thing together we're going to leave here to go can you hear me in

him escape the wreckage and swim sure number three Aaron Paul Breaking Bad what are we going to tell me did you know Jesse Pinkman was supposed to be killed off in the first season of Breaking Bad man you should have told me the idea was badass from what I hear but the writers may never have had the chance to save Jesse is Aaron Paul wasn't a perfectionist in episode 6 of the first season Paul asked change the position where he was standing I get it now this was very lucky because a boulder fell down off the roof of Aaron had been during the filming of the scene it's too risky okay and we're making money why can't you just be satisfied with the way that number two Tom Hanks Castaway only a minor cut it quickly became when he finally went to the hospital a doctor told him the cut
