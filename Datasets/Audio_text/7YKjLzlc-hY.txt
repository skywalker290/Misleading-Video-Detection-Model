you smelt the hype it all went down you saw the previous video you see many videos on the new devices from Samsung S10 10 + they're out there and they're they're kind of interesting to be honest but something that struck me just using these things a little more how different Samsung software is now via this do one UI that they're using of course I have a long history with Samsung skins on top of the Android operating system what used to be called TouchWiz at one time I was never a big fan of it it always felt kind of bolted on what's a Half Baked this is is it's a breath of fresh air I felt the need to jump back on here call me crazy but I'm starting to think this play actually be the first skin that I want to use maybe even more than stock am I saying this right now is this me I've never said that before but let me give you a quick rundown okay so the best part of this one UI is when you swipe down from the top so that looks pretty normal but when you pull down the second time ask where things get really exciting you pull down and pull down again and everything that you would normally have to reach up to access right here for one-handed use now that's kind of nice to have on the S10 but it's even nicer to have on the S10 Plus which let's be honest that's a pretty big phone they went to the drawing board here and they're like well what should it be like for one-handed use that's the simplest best implementation I've ever seen secondary swipe to bring everything back down into reach if you do head into the settings you'll see it exists even within there now you're probably noticing another thing which I really like about one UI which is of course this really cool looking dark mode on the right hand side so this is the S10 plus over here enable dark mode on there they're calling it night mode as you can see right here and I'm a big fan of these in general if you're using price in a in a dark environment it's it's far less obnoxious you're not getting beamed with nearly as much light it's just more comfortable to use and it's covert take a look at it now another thing that's happened here is in in terms of the cartoonish not necessarily dial but I'm starting to understand that having these larger icons also lends itself to one-handed message in this particular case you don't need to be as precise and you can just go ahead and reach more of it the fingerprint scanner and the unlock Samsung is doing something very special with the fingerprint scanner in these two devices these guys are using Sonic they're actually using sound waves to judge the distance between ridges on your fingerprint it's it's kind of amazing when fingerprint I mean the speed I was trying to check is it faster or slower than the optical based ones I think it's about the same but the advantage of this particular technology is it's tougher to full because it does actually look for blood flow that's like play superhero villain scenario they chop your finger off get access destroy the world and so on not going to happen this particular device Kirk okay you can you can rest easy if they chop your finger off it's no good cuz there's no blood flow ultrasound also supposedly this is going to function better with a fingerprint that might be a little bit dirty or wet whatever I stay out of that department but if if you're in a certain kind of business maybe this is better if your hands are dirty if your fingertips it works 8 really works better it does feel a bit slower when you're coming straight from here you see what I mean with the black screen but if you do I'd say it's comparable to the optical scanners but it does seem like slightly robust Tech now let's go ahead and register the face unlock as well I'd like to show you guys how that works so it does give you a warning on who recognition it tells you that this is not completely secure it's not the most secure form of authentication but I do tree to set up process here on the regular S10 so you see what you're in for it's very fast one thing that play bugs me it's a two-step thing similar to the iPhone I'll show you what I mean here okay hit the button it sees you phone is unlocked and can you swipe up on the OnePlus device for example which just has a strictly has a photo based Face Unlock you just hit the boom it unlocks immediately now some people may like that some people Maybe not maybe it's easier to hack one thing I do like about this implement if you look up here you look closely at the front facing camera cut out there's that cool animation that pops up again letting you know what does activated it worked and then you go ahead and unlock otherwise if it doesn't see you you hit it with the thumbprint and you're in Crucible it works and you have the face unlock option which is also baked in there another cool thing in here they have added the wireless Power share I think this is a it's a fun feature Wireless Power share tap that on play this device against any your device that has cheat compatibility and like check this out okay so we're going to line them up Kirk keep an eye up there on the icon okay ready I'm going to go ahead and initiate it and just like that you get the you get the sound notification as well as the visual notific you're now charging up this device from this device now there is another glaring interface / Hardware aspect to this device I know a lot of people going to have questions about that is of course the Bixby button dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun here into tech fans around the globe I know I have nightmares about the Bixby button and and what it really wants to do to me anyhow apparently apparently apparently does this make sense in this context not really apparently in a software update that button is going to become completely configurable Caillou it will be able to launch any application that you like imagine that a dedicated button that you get to configure I think it's a good move on Samsung's behalf and I'm starting to see a lot of things that I kind of like about this device it's crazy situation just for a moment you throw on the dark you get the one-handed functionality it's quick you can go in there and actually turn down animations now what are we doing here are we looking to them now for it's kind of amazing and I think it's going to be one of the differentiating factors with this particular device can you send the last video I'm going to use this a little bit more but I felt the need to just do a little highlight here on the one UI some promising who sings happening with this device outside of strictly the hardware the software seems to have taken a step in the right direction and that's a good thing for tech fans around the world also wants the Bixby thing happens you could be done with those nightmares you can stop even Otis is having Bixby nightmares you're going to finally they're going to finally let us remap the Bixby button it can launch any app this button here that look
