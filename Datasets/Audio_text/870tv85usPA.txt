we are currently in a pandemic I did get covid 2 weeks back again on the same day pretty much and then but I don't what is how hyper is on setting hey everyone welcome to fenfast Showcase and joining me today is someone who have actually known even before his first time hit the theaters ever since then he's only gotten better and bigger with each of his film he's a fantastic actor a favorite and definitely the most fun person in any room please welcome to very very cool Varun Dhawan Varun WhatsApp what's up girl very proud moment of me to be on your show which is hosted by you and like you said that we've known each other the beginning of my career I know you were like an intern back then no I mean I just joined this one I'm so happy what are doing this my own and people are loving you and loving the way you ask and girl celebrities and take the recovered and all but are you doing fine I'm doing much better now I think I'm retaining a lot of my energy and I think release on Amazon Prime video I think that excitement that you know when people like book and then the whole new 40 out kids watching it and all that stuff that just gave me a lot of joy and I think I'm feeling much better now you know they need a merry Christmas for you and I mean it released Christmas and a record number of people stop the movie on the first video to you so you know honestly it was very important that so that the press release that Amazon did about the reach of the film and the amount of people that have seen it and Lake from 5 to 9:25 and kids watching this film driving in the viewership I'm all over the world is very encouraging but I knew this but in our industry in a film industry is very important that you give this just reviews of people random people is never going to be enough you know you have to get the Gentiles kind of find out what viewership is to gauge whether something is good or bad just general you know critical feedback cannot be used for the mass film like cooling if I could say so any normal theatrical release this is no idea what would your state of mind just hours before the film went live why does exciting exhilarating and honesty went live at 11:00 at night and you know I saw it and I was excited and but the morning at 7:00 while I was in Chandigarh came in and he said I want to thing that kind of surprised me you know we wait for at least the 12:00 shorts and they had a fire stick I think instantly go to theaters for you know and specially the single screen and I Know It was supposed to release in the theaters start of the year and you are you and everyone with associated with the film took time to make the final decision it's not my decision who's paying the salaries to people and Black Friday that's the time I think that people will stay scared and kind of give up and you can't blame anyone for that you know end of the whole thing is that we are in a pandemic and we want to adapt and tomorrow hopefully we will be fine and everything good vaccines are going to come in but this decision cannot be questioned or look back at that what is we are currently in I did get covid 2 weeks back so you know it's it's it's a tricky space to be in and it's a time when you know it's it's a diamond vehicle as an industrial so I feel really bad what is better than what and you know that don't go that's the way it should be that's good but unfortunately it always isn't like that I'm hoping that the play some bills start changing all those things your dad and you know he's such a veteran and you know he's still at it and you which is really like a lot of freedom to his actors to perform an independent the scene in their way what I don't like is how hyper he is on set right now what do you do anything to calm down because blood pressure medicines to calm down one thing somebody told you about watching the film one compliment which really touched you so I see you I will name the person because I only use them for the film but he saw the film and he was like you don't have to watch the film again and again because of my son and you know you're nice looking and stuff I can all watch but my son keep posting videos people are actually looking forward to 2021 with a lot of what are you hoping for the most and of course vaccine and the whole you know the situation to get what is the weather forecast for 2021 and what's in store for you I think adapting to the current situation and hoping that I have traveled around the country a little bit and a lot of people have lost jobs during because of this pandemic it's difficult for so many people business returning to what it used to be or just increasing from what the current scenario is so that a lot of people can going back to work start earning the livelihoods and according to me that's the need of the of the eye at the moment people keep talking people's mind people don't care about that people care about earning their livelihood entertainment is going to come later on and what's important is that people can start getting back to work safely and family start feeling more secure and earning your livelihood I think for me I best number one thing right now the people can start doing that any person goes I'm sure everybody wants to know about your marriage as well is it nothing concrete at the moment Sunday but let there be a little bit more certainty hopefully why don't you have a fun game for you find very quick questions only and so the first question is 87 how many number one films fantastic including the recent episode he was nominated in the best director category of the filter take a guess you're so good I mean your dad will be so proud of you watching this yet okay the last month iconic collaboration for him is Govinda how many films have Govinda and David Hernandez 17th 70 Bangor Area diabetes so proud of you right now watching this thank you so much fun talking to you and best of luck for where do you want to all of us I think it's very important and lots of love to you also doing some great stuff and
