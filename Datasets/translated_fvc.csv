Footage showed the riderless motorbike driving in a straight line along the A4 outside Paris.

A BIZARRE video of a “ghost motorbike” cruising along a motorway outside Paris with no rider has sparked much confusion among freaked out motorists.

Footage showed the riderless motorbike driving in a straight line, a little too close to the central reservation on the A4 outside Paris.

One driver, who asked his friend to film the surreal scene, said: “On the video, we can clearly see the two-wheeled … without a biker. A ghost.”

But the mystery of the ghost rider may have been solved, with Le Parisien reporting that the motorbike was involved in a collision seconds before.

The rider, who was in his 20s, was knocked off his bike and injured his arm in the crash with another vehicle.

According to reports, the driver of the car picked up the rider and took him to try and find his bike, but there was no trace of it.

The driver then took the motorbike rider to hospital.

Stunt motorcyclist Jean-Pierre Goy, who has appeared in James Bond films, said riderless motorbikes can run for more than 600m, especially with cruise control.

“The pilot may have fallen, and in view of the motorcycle, with a very low centre of gravity, it was possible to continue its journey,” he said.

“I’ve seen motorcycles ride like this even longer, especially with the cruise control blocked.”

I managed to get my hands on this video when I was in South Africa a couple of months ago, a hunter showed me and thought it was hilarious.  For me this video highlights a distressing situation that the world needs to see.

Every year trophy hunters kill thousands of exotic wild animals in Africa, this combined with poaching poses a serious threat to the survival of our most loved and endangered species.  We have to stop this now.  Animals are also bred in captivity for the sole purpose of being hunted by tourists who are willing to pay the high price tag, a lion hunt can cost a trophy hunter up to $35'000.

A veteran trainer at Orlando's SeaWorld was dragged under water to her death Wednesday in the jaws of Tilikum, the oldest and largest killer whale in captivity, as horrified onlookers watched.

The normally docile orca had killed twice before.

Tourists eating poolside at a daily event called ""Dining With Shamu"" watched the whale drown 40-year-old Dawn Brancheau.

Tourists in an underwater viewing area saw the whale swim by, flipping the bleeding trainer over and over in his mouth.

""It was terrible. It's very difficult to see the image,"" Brazilian tourist Joao Lucio DeCosta Sobrinho, 28, told reporters.

SeaWorld suspended its famous water shows as officials tried to figure out what had happened.

Witnesses described vastly different events: One said Brancheau was patting the whale when he grabbed her arm and dragged her into the water. Another said the big bull orca leaped up out of nowhere and began shaking her.

The whale ""shot up in the air, grabbed the trainer by the waist and started thrashing [her] around,"" witness Victoria Biniak told Orlando's WKMG-TV. ""It was violent.""

Sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons said Brancheau slipped and fell into the water with the 30-year-old, 6-ton Tilikum, who is not accustomed to people in his tank.

A number of park visitors said several of the whales had appeared unsettled earlier in the day and were not responding to trainers.

Tilikum, whose name means ""friend"" in the Native American language Chinook, has killed before - always unwittingly.

In 1991, a marine biology student and part-time trainer fell into his tank in Canada and was dragged under by Tilikum. The whale and two females blocked her from getting out of the pool and tossed her back and forth in the air between them like a toy.

In 1999, there was a case so bizarre it made headlines around the world: A man sneaked into Tilikum's pool at SeaWorld and his naked corpse was found the next day splayed on the whale's back.

Experts chalked up both incidents to the orca's misguided attempts at playing. The huge, scary-looking mammals do not generally attack humans.

Brancheau was aware of the dangers posed by the giant marine mammals.

""You can't put yourself in the water unless you trust them and they trust you,"" she told The Orlando Sentinel for a profile published four years ago.

The water park was closed until the weekend. Officials said they did not yet know when the orca show would resume.

""All of our standard operating procedures will be under review,"" park President Dan Brown said.

Experts said they weren't sure what set off the whale.

""What he did in the previous two incidents were not attacks - to him, the people were toys, and to a whale, being under water for 20 minutes is nothing. This sounds a little more like an attack,"" said Naomi Rose, a senior scientist at the Humane Society of the United States.

It was unclear what will happen to Tilikum.

""I dread to think of what they think their options are,"" Rose said.

Brancheau's sister Diana Gross said last night that her sibling ""would not want anything done to that whale.""

""She loved the whales like her children, she loved all of them,"" said Gross, of Indiana.

Rose suggested Tilikum be retired to a sea pen in Iceland, like Keiko, the killer whale Hollywood made famous in 1993's ""Free Willy.""

Rose said such tragedies prove that wild animals should not be kept in pens to perform for tourists. Killer whales are social and intelligent creatures but get stressed in pens, she said.

The orca show is SeaWorld's biggest draw, and crowds line up far ahead of the performances at Shamu Stadium, which seats 5,500.",3121,380,3772011

63,6411gQdfQwg,FAKE,Islamists publicly beheaded a US journalist (news),"http://ntdtv.ru/ Islamists publicly beheaded a journalist from the United States. The public execution of an American was carried out for the first time by Islamist militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group. The video was later uploaded to social media.

The militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant released a video entitled “Message to America.” It is believed to record the beheading of American journalist James Foley. The man disappeared in Syria about two years ago.

The video was uploaded to social networks. It is impossible to confirm its authenticity.

Foley worked as a reporter in the Middle East for five years. He was kidnapped on November 22, 2012 by unknown armed men.

The man on his knees, identified as James Foley, makes his dying address.

[James Foley, American journalist]:
“I call on my family and friends to rise up against my real killers, the US government, because what will happen to me is only the result of his arrogance and criminality.”

The White House announced that intelligence was already working to confirm the authenticity of the video. The group's militants have not previously executed American citizens in public. The video was released after the US resumed airstrikes in Iraq for the first time since the end of the occupation in 2011.

The masked man speaks with a British accent.

[member of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]:
“This is James Wright Foley, a citizen of the United States, your country. As a government, you have been at the forefront of aggression against the Islamic State.”

The video then shows the man being beheaded. Then - his body.

The militants also showed footage of another journalist, saying that his life depended on US actions in Iraq.

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is a Sunni insurgent group. At the end of June 2014, it declared a caliphate, that is, an Islamic state, in large areas of the Levant and Iraq.",3614,412,807600

This picks up a few years where the final season left off with Ben and Emma grown up. Mike and Phoebe have trouble with marriage, Monica and Chandler are getting a divorce, Joey couldn't find someone, and Ross and Rachel have trouble after many years of not being together! Filled with some surprise appearances by today's actors, along with some old friends (no pun intended), this movie will be an all-star extravaganza, while showing a lesson in being there for each other.

──────────────────

It's the news we'd all been waiting for and over the weekend, the Friends cast finally revealed they are reuniting for an exclusive, untitled, unscripted special on HBO Max.

Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer are officially BACK!

The main stars of “Friends” are going to appear on a reunion special, 16 years after the NBC show came to an end. The unscripted special was originally going to be available at the launch of HBO Max, a new streaming service. But due to production being halted because of the coronavirus, the release date is reportedly unknown.

The friends will gather at the same Warner Bros. studio where they filmed the original series and reminisce about the show.

The actors confirmed the reunion by sharing a photo that was used for their 1995 Rolling Stone cover. The stars will also serve as executive producers and will receive at least $2.5 million each, according to Variety.

The reunion show will not be a new episode of Friends after all these years, nor will this be some kind of remake or reboot. Although the reunion will be shot at the same Warner Bros. soundstage that the series was, this will be an unscripted show, meaning it will probably be more retrospective than revival. The cast will lounge around the old set while clips play, most likely. 

HBO Max will also be the exclusive streaming home for Friends.

Friends is an American television sitcom, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six 20–30-something friends living in Manhattan. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Marta Kauffman, and David Crane.

Here it is!!! The video that broke the internet 7 straight days. The attention was unbelievable when I first posted the clip. Ended-up on 6 TV shows on NBC, Discovery Channel, and MTV! 

I still can’t believe I caught this on camera!!! The McLaren ran the stop sign and make a kid fall off his skateboard. You can hear the skateboard in the video. The passenger of the McLaren yelled something at him and the next thing I heard was a SMASH!  The windshield was completely shattered.

Kid took off running and the passenger ran after him. No idea what ended up happening after the car drove off. I guess the lesson here is DON'T RUN STOP SIGNS!

https://www.cgtn.com/video 

(Viewer discretion advised: some may find this footage disturbing) 

One woman was killed and another injured after a pair of tigers pounced on them at Beijing's Badaling Wildlife Park on Saturday afternoon. 

The tigers attacked one of the women when she left her vehicle and walked a few meters away from the car. The surveillance video footage shows the woman being dragged by the tiger, which prompted the second woman, who later turned out to be her mother,  to rush for help.However, she didn't survive the attack.

While the park allows visitors to drive their own cars in a safari-style tour, they are prohibited to get out as the animals roam freely through the park. But the first woman got out of the car after an alleged argument, putting her life at risk, according to several media reports. 

The park has been closed for the time being. But the weekend attack wasn’t the first. In August 2014, a security guard was killed in a tiger attack at the same park.

The officers were responding to a traffic accident involving the unnamed suspect, 26, who was driving a stolen car. The suspect had fatally shot another man just hours earlier in East Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times reported.

When the officers attempted to pat the alleged gunman down, he opened fire at close range with a semiautomatic pistol.

A shootout ensued, which resulted in the death of officer Keith Boyer, 53, a 27-year veteran of the police force. 

The gunman was also injured, but is expected to survive.

According to police, the alleged gang member was out on parole and had been released from prison early under new laws that aim to reduce incarcerations in California.

155,a6sG41GDwtA,REAL,Polar bear attack woman in Berlin Germany A polar bear attack on a woman,"Polar bear attack woman in Berlin Zoo. BERLIN, April 10 (RIA Novosti) - A woman jumped into a cage with polar bears in the Berlin Zoo on Friday morning, surviving being attacked by one of the bears, local radio reported. 
The incident occurred when zookeepers were feeding the animals, one of whom attacked the intruder. She received bites to her arms and legs, but staff managed to repel the bear, the BB station said. 

The woman was taken to Virchow hospital in Berlin. 
The cause of the incident is being investigated. Police suspect the woman is mentally ill as she ""did not fall into the cage accidentally but jumped there herself."" 
Last December, a man who later described himself as ""lonely"" jumped into the cage of the zoo's most famous polar bear, but emerged unscathed after zookeepers managed to distract Knut with beef. 
The radio said the celebrity bear, who won the sympathy of millions of people from all over the world because he was abandoned by his mother shortly after his birth, was not involved in Friday's incident as he lives in a separate cage. 
A spokesman for the zoo said Knut, now two years and four months old, would never harm a human.

156,3GpzWnWKxkE,REAL,Man throws himself at the lions in the metropolitan park of Santiago 2,"(Watch Another Angle of this same video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG0wVgR0gB4)
Two lions sacrificed due to the incident of a man who jumped into the cage at the Santiago Zoo

“He walked around the cage and asked the people, what would happen if he jumped at the lions,” is the first thing that Marianela Vargas, a San Felipe native who was visiting the Santiago Metropolitan Park Zoo with her three children, points out, the circumstances in which a A man initially identified as Franco Ferrada was hanging around the lions' cage inside the enclosure.

“We never thought it was something abnormal and we always believed that it was some show prepared by the zoo for the people who were there. Only when the man climbed the fence and undressed did we understand that the matter was not normal,” said the nervous mother, who left the place with her children to ask for help.

“When we heard the screams and that the lions were making a lot of noise, we approached to see what it was about, realizing that the lions grabbed the man by the neck and dragged him to the middle of the cage,” says Daniela Cáceres, another San Felipeño. in the place.

She and her son, as well as his father, were visiting the African lion cage section of the Metropolitan Zoo this Saturday morning when they had to witness the event that moved visitors to the park.

“We thought it was some show, until we saw the zoo staff running and shouting at the lions. At that moment they evacuated us, in fact they evacuated all the people who were in the zoo, even in other more distant parts. They kept us outside for more than half an hour until they made us come back in,” said Daniela Cáceres.

Staff at the facility launched the emergency operation, first sounding the evacuation sirens and throwing water at the animals.

After the attendees left, they proceeded to shoot the pair of lions, a male and a female about 20 years old, causing their death.

The man was taken out of the cage and treated first by zoo staff, and then transferred in serious condition to the Indisa Clinic, which is the facility that maintains an agreement with the zoo.

Inside the subject's belongings, a suicide letter was found in which he justified his actions for religious reasons, warning of the arrival of the apocalypse.

The director of the enclosure described the incident as “regrettable” and assured that for the Park it is a fact of utmost regret “to have had to sacrifice the lions to save the life of a person.” In the same way, she clarified that in these cases, applying anesthetics would mean waiting about 4 minutes for them to take effect and thereby losing valuable time in the life of a human being in danger.

Social networks immediately reacted to the news, mainly adopting a position of rejection of the death of the animals. “I went around the cage and asked people, what would happen if they jumped at the lions,” is the first thing Marianela Vargas points out, San Felipeña who was visiting the Santiago Metropolitan Park Zoo with her three children, the circumstances in which a man initially identified as Franco Ferrada was hanging around the lion cage inside the enclosure.

They kept us outside for more than half an hour until they made us come back in,” said Daniela Cáceres.

174,wR4QAS9rB7E,REAL,The Day After Tornado Survivors Harrowing Stories,"Moore, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Sun was hard to come by in Moore, Oklahoma, Tuesday. The sky still looked menacing, dark and foggy. Mist turned to rain. Lightning struck.

From the air, this suburb outside Oklahoma City looked like flattened cardboard. On the ground, homes were messes of splinters. Cars, thrown like toys, sat in ridiculous places. Hunks of steel hung in trees -- the trees that were left. Most were shaved down to gnarly apocalyptic wishbones.

When people were allowed back on their street -- if emergency crews gave them the green light -- that's when the real trauma set in for many.

It's bizarre and disorienting when every landmark and sign your eye knows is suddenly gone and there's miles of nothing in its place.

""It's funny when you can't tell your own stuff when you get back and look at it like this,"" Mack James said, standing in the rubble that used to be his house.



Moore has no power. Water is out and volunteers are handing out bottles. The twister is gone but the danger is still real.

Gas lines are being checked. Crews are out searching for live wires.

""It was horrible,"" recalled one elderly woman, sitting in a chair near piles of debris. ""The thunder and the sound was like a turning of the world. It was so bad but we were in the cellar right out there. You could hear the thing just blowin', hear the pounding.

""I can't even believe I'm still alive.""

The realization of the loss of material things is just beginning. Photos are gone. Family heirlooms might not ever be found.

How to help

But there is worse. Rescue workers are still trying to find survivors, as reports keep coming in about those missing.

Wearing a thick red hoodie, Zack Woodcock looked intensely worried and lost in thought as he told a CNN reporter that a wrestler on his son's wrestling team was missing.

""It's hard,"" he muttered, looking like he hasn't been to sleep.

The death toll, as of 2 p.m.. ET, is 24, according to Oklahoma City Medical Examiner spokeswoman Amy Elliott. Nine of the dead are children, she said.

Frantic kids and parents

On Monday evening, kids screamed for their parents and parents hollered their children's names, walking and searching in panic in a parking lot near Briarwood Elementary.

""Caleb! Caleb!"" one woman could be heard screaming, as another woman, her face bloody, walked zombie-like through the crowd, holding a young boy's hand.

""Step over the wire!"" someone shouted. Adults and children zigzagged past each other. One man went to a little boy standing alone, whose face was just then cracking into a full-out cry. The man put his arm around the child and they both looked out into the chaotic parking lot, apparently searching for the boy's parents.

One mother who spotted her son sitting with his teacher on a curb gently grabbed the boy's hands and stood him up and then learned her whole body over him, hugging him. She cried and then laughed and cupped his face.

""He was so brave!"" the teacher said.

The mother then embraced the teacher. ""Thank you,"" she wept, ""thank you.""

Another man who appeared to be a teacher held his arm up and shouted, ""5th graders!"" But, of course, parents and kids continued to wander, desperate, scared. It was a valiant effort though -- trying to offer order where none could be found.

A teacher saves her students

Incredibly, everyone at Briarwood made it out alive.

Monday afternoon, second-grade teacher Tammy Glasgow was in her classroom when her husband shot her a text: ""Storms are coming. Be careful.""

She tried to text back but her phone was out, and she couldn't pull up websites to check the news.

Something had felt off for awhile that morning, Glasgow said. She knew the area. She knew what that could mean.

""It was kinda ominous, real humid, just had a bad feeling,"" she said, walking with a CNN reporter on the school grounds now crowded with twisted metal, rebar and piles of concrete blocks. A bright yellow playground set stood out amid the gray.

Glasgow said that just before the twister hit, she went to the window. The kids were singing the National Anthem.

""You could just see it,"" she said.

An announcement came on the loudspeaker to get to a safe place.

She quickly hustled 12 girls into a girls' bathroom. A worried father who'd already shown up to the school helped get boys into the boys' bathroom. Another teacher, a counselor and three other kids got in a closet, Glasgow said.

""Before I shut the doors [to the boys' bathroom], I said, 'I'm gonna shut these doors. I love you.'"" The boys looked at me a little strange.""

Glasgow's own son was in the bathroom. She looked at him for a moment.

""I just said, 'Watch over them. Take care of them.'""

Then she told the girls she loved them.

""We love you back!"" they chimed.",56,7,12450

28th January 2016 Mumbai (INDIA), Late night some people spotted a huge fish in the high tide water. Morning on 29th Jan people saw huge 40 feet whale fish washed on the juhu beach shore. Thousands of people gathered to see the dead whale fish, national media reached the spot and LIVE news was flashed on Indias most of the channels. Lifeguards and Police was called to mantain law and orders on the beach. Police and lifeguards keep people away from the fish as to keep people safe from any viral infection if fish cascare had carried.
While this whale shark may be huge and rarely seen, it joins many other sea creatures that have unfortunately been washed up on the beaches. Some of the deaths of these animals may be a mystery, but many can be related back to drought and humans.A study by Baylor University showed that drought conditions not only affect water levels, but also water quality. Chemicals, like ammonia, can be more toxic during drought conditions. The study found that when pH levels shift, ammonia in the water can become toxic and affect the fish.According from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 80 percent of pollution to marine life comes from the land. Non point source pollution is the largest cause, which includes septic tanks, cars, trucks, and boats. Farms, ranches, and forest area also contribute to the nonpoint pollution. Oil pollution is also a large killer of sea life. Rough seas spread the oil through the marine environment, as well as to the fish or birds that eat an oil-poisoned animal. 
late in the evening the cascara of whale was berried on the shore of Mora village which is end of Silver beach.",2280,93,3147652

This chilling video captures the moment a man flirted with disaster as a fighter jet flew just a few feet over his head at extreme speed.
The incredibly low fly-by, coupled with the man's game of chicken, may be one of the most dangerous stunts of all time.
Footage shows the Free Libyan Air Force plane appearing to emerge out of thin air as it flew just off the ground.

205,SLMa5-n2OVc,REAL,Grizzly Bear Charge in Jasper,"While mountain biking in Jasper, Alberta on August 4, 2013, my cousin Dan and I were charged by a grizzly sow three times. 

We were riding single track just outside of Jasper town-site (9c) when the encounter occurred. I rode to the top of a hill and applied the brakes to wait for Dan and plan my descent. My brakes squealed a bit, then I heard a growl and looked to my right to see a grizzly bear charging at me.

After careening down the hill a bit on my bike, I was able to distance myself from the bear. According to Dan, who was subsequently charged, the sow stopped on the trail where I had been standing.

When Dan arrived on the scene, he created a distraction, which drew the bear to him. He managed to grab the bear spray from his bag in time to brace himself, but the bear stopped approximately 10 meters from him - just outside the spray's effective range. Frankly, I'm glad we didn't have to injure the mother in any way.

Meanwhile, I worked my way along the bottom of the gully toward Dan so that I wasn't alone in the rough bush. As I reached him, the sow and her cub charged toward us slightly once more before heading away in the direction that we had come from.

We waited a few minutes, then walked away from the scene along the trail with bear spray in hand.

Hawaii Ocean Safety Tips:
- Waves are unpredictable - don't turn your back to the ocean.
- It may seem like fun but standing over blow holes is extremely dangerous and had led to severe injury and death.
- If the rocks you're standing on are wet, it means waves have already been there; use caution and retreat to dry ground.
- Be respectful of local fishing and diving spots.

Surveillance cameras in Shandong Jiaotong University recorded two children accidentally falling into a pond, and after struggling for two minutes in the water, both of them were successfully saved by a security guard, who arrived after seeing them floating in the pond through his monitors. According to staff from the university, the security guard also didn’t know how to swim, which made his decision to jump into the water even more heroic. 
 
More than 160 people drown every day in China, and drowning is the leading cause of death among children aged 5 to 14, according to estimates released by the World Health Organization in 2014.

A few years ago, I had attended a conference where W was the keynote speaker. During his presidency, I was totally against him and did not like him one bit. In person, as he sat on stage and engaging with the moderator, he was personable and not the buffoon that we often saw with his Bushisms. He was great, funny and someone who I'd love to have a few beers with. After seeing him, I purchased his book.
Quite often former presidents become close friends with other former presidents, even when they're of different parties and politically polar opposites of each other. Seeing photos of the Obama's and Bush's show that they're genuinely fond of each other and are quite close.

On July 2nd, my friend Samantha and I were driving to the lodge for dinner when we encountered a bear far ahead in the road. This is a somewhat normal occurrence for here. Usually, the bears run off and catching a close up glimpse is hard. We slowed our vehicle down to where we saw the bear cross the road when suddenly it erupted from the bushes and came after our vehicle. After this incident, we turned back around to see what was making the bear so agitated. We could see no cubs, no kill, or anything that would make this bear behave the way it did. It charged us again so we went to the lodge to warn everyone of the incident. This is a popular road in town located maybe 500 yards from the lodge so we wanted to let people know not to walk or bike there. In the rear view mirror we witnessed the bear also chase another vehicle that passed by after us without the occupants even knowing They were heading to our lodge for dinner too.Even though I was in a car, it was one of the scariest moments of my life!""

N.Korea defector regains consciousness, video shows getaway under fire - Reuters

22-Nov-2017 12:06:38

Adds details on defector's condition

By Haejin Choi and Josh Smith

SEOUL, Nov 22 (Reuters) - North Korean border guards were only steps behind a North Korean soldier when they opened fire and one briefly crossed the border pursuing the wounded defector as he dashed to the South Korean side, a video released on Wednesday by the U.N. Command (UNC) in Seoul showed.

The defecting soldier, whose rank and identity have not been disclosed, was critically wounded, having been hit five or six times in the hail of bullets as he made his desperate escape on Nov.13. He was flown by a U.S. military helicopter to a hospital in Suwon, south of Seoul.

Doctors announced on Wednesday that he had regained consciousness, having had two operations to extract the bullets, and his breathing was stable and unassisted.

""He is fine,"" lead surgeon Lee Cook-Jong said at a press conference in Suwon. ""He is not going to die.""

An official from U.N. Command (UNC) said North Korea had been informed on Wednesday that it had violated the 1953 armistice agreement, which marked the cessation of hostilities in the Korean War.

The UNC official told a news conference that a soldier from the North Korean People's Army (KPA) had crossed the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), the border between the two Koreas, for a few seconds as others fired shots at the defecting soldier.

“The key findings of the special investigation team are that the KPA violated the armistice agreement by one, firing weapons across the MDL, and two, by actually crossing the MDL temporarily,” Chad Carroll, Director of Public Affairs for the UNC, told reporters.

The dramatic video showed a military vehicle speeding toward the border, passing checkpoints manned by North Korean guards before appearing to get stuck in a ditch.

North Korean soldiers were only a few metres away when the defector jumped from the vehicle and fled on foot, scrambling up slightly rising ground to cross the border.

Moments after this a handful of North Korean soldiers are seen running to toward the abandoned vehicle and stopping to open fire, though one appears to briefly cross the dividing line between the two countries before turning around.

The video does not show the moment when the defector was hit, but he is seen lying motionless next to a concrete wall in one of the later edited clips in the video.

Three South Korean troops, including the deputy commander of the border security unit, are seen crawling through undergrowth to drag the wounded North Korean to safety.

Doctors conducted a series of surgeries on the critically wounded soldier, and now say they believe he will recover, despite continued risks of infection.

""Patient requires intensive care, detailed tests and observation as there is a chance his condition may worsen due to infections of his bullet wounds,"" the hospital said in a statement.

The soldier show signs of depression and possible trauma, in addition to a serious case of parasites that has complicated his treatment, the hospital said.",12088,2601,3406858
