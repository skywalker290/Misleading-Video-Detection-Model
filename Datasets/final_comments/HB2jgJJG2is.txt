skcreech sound scary voice background chill like it39s every Thursday Japanese building dancing none collapsed That39s superb engineering Wow 91 earthquake building still standing used teach English 53 floor Shinjuku Center Building Luckily never felt quake can39t imagine would like one elevator swinging back forth Hi work Ciaopeople Italian publisher Geopop I39m writing reference video Im head visual storytelling would achieve videostory Facebook Instagram Youtube channel Japan example follow earthquake prevention Thats Im asking permission use part video crediting Let know soon possible Thanks advance ugly building earth quake happen 800pm today thing Japan uh oh thats good sign would likely spaz stair like tmr they39re groovin soo happy earthquake Fuck Hellowe TV documentary production company Germany called ECO Media TV producing different documentary several German TV station ARD ZDF NDR ARTE Currently working project earthquake metropolitan area focus Mexico City

refer u copyright ownerYour cooperation much appreciated Hope hear youBest regardsVegas von Vogelstein ECO Media TV Teamour website reply via email like dokumentationecomediatvde Hi Could please contact footage Atelevision company interested featuring programme Manythanks filmfinder1gmailcom look surreal creepy good job engineer guy know spell Inglish second thought fell building way camera panned pretty quick Lol hasta hai harami ka pilla jb girega na building tb smjh ayga possible kind foundation sky scraper even grounded underneath building carried swaying awful long time arsehole would popping like fizzy drink Soo scary dancing rascal punishment allah standing building standing flimsy foundation built cheap material look like talk shitty engineering Michael Bay film there39s magnitude 6 earthquake building would fell straight like 9 fucking 11 exploding every building stand even small one ruinsthat39s Japan don39t care safe building moving I39m getting fuck Earthquake Back desk Thanks japan people build ridiculous building probably take twenty fucking minute ride elevator top NishiShinjuku shot high floor Shinjuku Center Building first building Nomura Building curvy shaped one immediately right Sompo Japan Building Towards end video see iLand Tower left many comment pointed building designed sway earthquake sound horrifying planet Japan scary nice video title watch much juju beat dance feel horrible people building must39ve terrifying think California take lesson want keep building higher taller Keio South Tower sibling Keio Plaza hotel original plaza hotel first high rise hotel Japan tallest building Shinjuku Japan 1971 taller structure built next 1974 movement caused wind Malaysian skycraper Twincle pencil best ingeneering creepy guy said quotawesome begginningquot XDD would cry see building swaying Earthquake that39s good thing usually mean it39s got sort antiEarthquake foundation cause move motion Earth instead resisting skyscraper designed sway like prevent colapse isn39t weird building video made isn39t moving it39s cool quotEarthquake make skyscraper dancingquot OoooKAY WOW Dancing building earthquake japanttb designed way modern building japan basically spring one side effect better sway collapse dyrektor korporacji zalicza awans sekretarce Giant spring mechanism make building sway earthquake prevents core structure breaking apart fixed ground emergency parachute building quotI prayed top egg wooden box eggshell allI sacrifice eggsquotBruno Mars 1977 Kissing Eggshells need jet fuel Fuck Shit r u still taking video run bitch run thats called Japan LOOL lel lol LOLZ Turkish Japanese Earthquakes fake building designed sway earthquake region safety instead collapsing force designed maximum deformation snapping completely Hi get message Please use video educational film school tectonics student studying physic credit send copy DVD Please let know ASAP Many thanks Alexis Pumpkin Interactive tower many many pant shat day Cool building able jiggle many people wear dust mask Japan WOW thats incredible Japanese best engineer thank sharing Nevermind didn39t see move actually designed based earthquake dont fall look meant Structural Engineer building move subjected lateral load like wind earthquake actually much safer tall building short 4 5 story building 4 5 story likely fall tall building harmonic resonance earthquake also depends greatly supporting foundation material also building sexy California advance earthquake engineering building look sexy would shart pant Impressionante show people make lazy Play 2x speed woooow θαυμαζω την φοβερη αρχιτεκτονικη τους japan normal someone explain advanced building US Would worse building remained stationary earthquake would think maybe would better absorb shock sure exactly WELCOME FUTUREJAPAN 2020 Oh god they39re alive US building built advanced even California extraordinary civil engineering Japanese would little unnerved cool leave Japanese man accomplish like engineering run blood never going lol don39t care earthquake proof building would39ve fly downstairs like tomorrow Nowdays thats make skycrapersso earthquake happends flex dont get destroyd fall apart holy shit designed flex keep crumbling shaking camera guy laughing mkay Japanese sen humour guess im sure bet inside building swaying scary fuck sky scraper gon na fall mean look side side dance engineering architecture science work Unlike idiot Americans Japanese invest thing related stupid shit like jesus trillion dollar tax break church Notice people aren39t screaming 39to god39 nonsense technology side Right Japan Right filming earthquake 50th floor laughing time steel ball skyscraper engineered take earthquake earthquake prone area skyscraper New York won39t withstand earthquake like say Seattle skyscraper would due fact wasn39t made withstand one 39cause it39s earthquake prone area would dropped deuce right swag sway skyscraper taller 100m withstand force even airplane impact WTC withstand unfortunately PURPOSELY blown government top building designer architect know unless got paid million spread bullshit history channel think misunderstood comment thought saying apart Japan UK building withstand earthquake 100 nevermind earthquake UK bitch please Don39t cocky country accepted kind earthquake engineering newer sky scraper Using technique Japanese apparently UK brings ability stand earthquake Japanese UK Ohh fuck Good didn39t sway pressure tension would cause havoc upon structure whole tsunami hiddenGodzilla attack America try make construction cheap possible like drywall steel column reinforced concrete really don39t need make building super strong country like Japan earthquake Bands make em dance скрип как в подводной лодке в quotDown Periscopequot building base isolated designed thathowever building camera pointing swaying one cameraman Ахиреть design actually come built pagoda Rather central pillar set ground it39s instead left freestanding first floor top subsequent floor aren39t directly attached rather hole cut around quotleanquot skyscraper generally 4 pillar pillar stand still floor free move side side absorb energy wo falling crazy thank info lol haven39t already realised three tower went 911 weren39t plane Physicists architect proved impossible fall zero resistance without quothelpquot obviously don39t know really happened apart medium told building well constructed could withhold many plane I39ll leave research like taping would sh know designed got ta sort damage structure idea excellent top building swaying like building wouldn39t fall kill I39d die heart attack 8 Slide left Slide right bring back y39all Holy shizz Would crap harlem shake OH HELL BITCH IM LOL Actually earthquake suspension system building western engineering left left loved Japan since found ULTRAMAN Johny Soko child amazing work engineering japanese amazing people look fun Japanese engineering finest Hatalmas kőbogyókon állnak az épületek náluk nem fog romba dőlni semmi holy shit creeking sound make much creepier engineering best reason watching building sway kept expecting building bust Transformer style LOL much Hollywood pretty amazing construction Impressive would likeill pot Apparently many building Japan built atop shock absorber move quake therefore lessening structural damage building course mean increased chance shit flying everywhere inside building that39s better thing coming popo time well nice toknow good building true supposed sway Thats good building dumb Mother god tower would fetal position cry like baby asian spent next three night 10th floor hotel rock n roll every aftershock north choice staying inside risk dying collapse staying outside dying hypothermia snow end day one lucky one severely inconvenienced unhurt home come back Actually need look design WTT39s nearly immediately surprised engineer architect actually designed tower fully capable standing impact multiple commercial airlinerseach building arent fire half structural support destroyed middle either building spring holding amp job quiet well Good thing make em flex nowadays holy shit Yup quot911quot colloquially referred world trade center building 1 2 designed withstand impact low speed 707 ultimately failed heavier 767 large fuel amount available Plus could trust engineering late 60 U G wonder picked UK example obvious hate pretty much apart Japan skyscraper country withstand powerful earthquake scale 100 911 one Los Angeles japanese mass damper thats crazy It39s actually Lots building Japan designed like Instead fighting earthquake making building fall swayed causing le damage take video right please contact asap violagpscaltechedu WTC 12 almost bunker able withstand 34 plane Architect told medium mainstream medium broadcasting channel newschannels course tell u lie many won39t know truth live Costa Rica country frequently earthquake long ago 76 earthquake 2 people died 4 house completely damaged Although may cool tech like Japan building made survive kind earthquake Every single house building survive made move quotdancequot like one video It39s huge deal wow tech day fuck america built like live brisbane weve never far know never even tremor earthquake WIDESCALE DESTRUCTION look inland tsunami 1 Question cameraman still focus amp shaky これも初見だ凄い Shows bullshit 911 official explanation especially WTC7 It39s actually difficult demolish high rise built many time stronger need don39t care go Tokyo Please Tokyo awesome drug lt3 Fuck lol building built 30 year ago Id pissing pant xD built like japan 11 year ago911 wouldn39t bad building done party rock Shuffle building dance ShhhhWE SHALL DANCE would shit earthquake happened Beijing China skyscraper would collapse Watching building swaying like making seasick structure built resist earthquake shock dont think structure world built resist airline crashing Dont hard please explain fall building Nr 7 plane hit quotterroristsquot touched one real Terrorist said quotPull itquot watched building collapse Stupid comment guarantee 737 filled fuel hit building it39s coming failure WTF building load loss due heat steal melting it39s dumb argument building usually designed based location terrorist attack there difference building collapsing earthquake one explosion melting steel beam cause one collapse wulda Se esse terremoto fosse aqui Brasil o ladrões iriam entrar na casas vazias e roubar tudo que pudessem carregar pessoas desesperadas na ruas seriam assaltadas Brasil quando há calamidades como sêca cheias de rio enchentes incêndios e queimadas florestais o ladrões deitam e rolam roubam tudo portanto estrangeiros fiquem bem longe Brasil aqui é país mais ou menos do ladrões e da corrupção política e pública Na Copa Mundo vocês verão punchline Something called engineering economic demand dared lived japan 4 year engineering unbelievable amazing work create actually think instead worrying look arigato Omg would even dare build high earthquake zone Ahhhhhhhhhhhhggghhhhhhhhhh scare hell already problem height I39ll run downstairs exit one word MadeInJapan earth moving way make building fall make go opposite direction earth39s movement would scary joke sturdy architecture contractor job guy top 39I hate Job39 one building would scared life I39m already afraid height would make ten time worse YEE RECTEN DISPENSER Wait minute SPY SAPPING SENTRY taken far informative Ooookay creepy fucccckkkkkkkkk scaryyy shitt hauhauahuah thing came tru head lol would freaky totally scare death seriously FUCK would dwn stair fast quake would still going Nope Rollers basically whole building designed shift around complex roller mechanism permit movement direction including circular motion building also built flexible absorb energy motion rather coming apart Japan really good since modern nation major earthquake risk US place like California 046 EVERYBODY DANCE o_o look sign building lol it39s going back forth well put NOPE allready top comment lol FUCKIN crazy soo put hydraulics building feel safe earthquake give quite adrenaline rush oh shit Oh Shit HOLY FCKIN SHIT They39re supposed sway like tree wind flexible likely survive Oh nopooped well said There39s nothing upset case like people saying quotthank god we39re alivequot Lets put simple quotgod believe one behind earthquake engineer one behind skyscraper collapsingquot you39ve thank someone careful enough thank right guy OMG hat engineer building la like supposed sway building would crumble OH HELL Город ходит ходуном Я твой небоскреб дом шатал delightful terrifying poop drawer kind way Awesome rare video thought rest camera something tripod made difference testament Japansese engineeering tokyo left standing ofcorse supposed sway otherwise crumple Japanese house building sturdy high quality world Even wooden five story pagoda made several hundred year ago survived big earthquake Hence cameraman remains calm isnt like spings bottom building heavy top building doesnt get destroyed repair concrete ide gun hand way end quick incase went engineer say modern high rise one best place earthquake believe much building swaying lol would flipping dont think ill visit id love first base jump building big earthquake builder name building Earthquakes common land rising sun Amazing Good ol39 Japan say call Dubai building rubble 89 earthquake hit don39t think building ugly FUCK THISS currently listening lmfao Actually Outstanding architecture Newyork would RAVE WOW sugoi thanks virtually proof Japan earth crust quickly move laterally whole meter Three piece crusttectonics permanently grinding towards hangingsticking longer period quake becoming quickly imminent however long earthquake last moron anyone know long take building like stop swaying hope people call smart people nerd geek bully smart one see video way see wsould thank quotgeeksquot quotnerdsquot saving life You39re welcome BWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUMMMMMMdodododododod ododododododdoddodododododododododododdodododoBWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMM OMG dont know hekk would I39d shit pant amazing Well done engineer Science bitchesit work impressive earthquake engineering also hear building creaking good construction FTW move like JaggerI39ve got move like JaggerI39ve got moooooves like Jagger XD los japoneses hacen todo bien _ un terremoto así en chile dios quiera hace desaparecer Sanhattan _ Sexy que feo se mueve Unbelievable really swaying back forth Ha godzilla chance knocking building building built bamboo bamboo sway39s back fourth without breaking instead steel building build bamboo it39s cheaper move like id pulling woman really trippy Holy crap see swaying back forth Man Glad u guy ok freaking scary building Masterful engineering Engineering Level Asian building collapse earthquake curious se colpiva la mia Italiaeravamo tutti da SPietro don39t know talking NYC39s skyscraper built resist similar force generated hurricane Essentially NYC39s skyscraper earthquake proof survive earthquake However apartment building reinforced collapse earthquake NY building would toppling free falling fire okay never going Japan impressive Engineering though Highrise engineering FTW earthquake hit NYC wouldn39t worried much skyscraper They39re designed kind event mind NYC recorded earthquake engineer know I39d lot worried older unreinforced brick masonry structure NYC lot hiashiro1 New York Big City amazing engineering top floor one building would cry like little girl sucking thumb imagined top redwhite thing trying increase motion AwesomeNstuff live SA 2 mini pussy earthquake past 2 year nothing compared country omfdgdfgsfd geez look scary Thats crazy seriously shit possible Japan nowhere else world big city building would never survive like Engineering best last thing flee building earthquake you39re likely get hit headinjured falling brick glass Buildings designed sway earthquake absorb energy Yay engineering lt3 xOxSweet238LipsxOx LMFAO DAYMN man huge structure MOVE like hiashiro1 new york built nothing land fill building Think Dance WOW que gran ingenieria la japonesa que horror haber estado en los ultimos pisos de estos edificios wow it39s amazing swaying like tree japanese sure know build oO really amazing watching evrytime remember experience feel dizziness felt time WOULD FREAK Amazing engineering built withstand kind shaking would shit pant wow amazing like alliiive OMG that39s scary know 20 massive earthquake hit Japan Oe Luckily already invented building home withstand almost earthquake oohohohohhooohhhi sweat belive saw pfffffffff resonance frequency 16 per second JoeA320Pilot dat 12 inch xD dat alot RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT Rollers used 20 story building sway 12 inch normal condition built earthquake epic vieo fuck named would literally wet _ single fuck given mother nature day wtf 046 like Junior high school dance Building Level Asians would living dream Oh god Chibzilla yeeeaah thinking commented video know time left loose loose stupidity like comment wow japanese build ANYTHING even building capable moving Impresionante najurinajuri don39t even feel like putting response together you39re typical brainwashed yanky Sad honestly Chibzilla It39s whole different effect impact plane sudden load much behavior building without taking account fire change property structural steel crashing plane one would bring ground Yeah okay America 60 floor building Panama tallest floor one earthquake xD scary though quake 34 Richter Scale p damn thats nut BigScaryFace probably none maybe damaged furniture computer LOL BRING BITCH hell build building It39s incredible nothing came crashing New Zealand 114 people killed 4 storey StudioLanguage School building collasped caught fire Makes quotstandardsquot absolutely pathetic compared Japan amazing footage especially seeing 2 building swaying building made 7039s gueydejalisco ya engneering doesnt go wish kind building Christchurch NZ whole time watching video fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck damage building need repair woW Buildings probably Union made Truly amazing Japanese genius I39m jealous im even made nervous Holy Hellthat amazing much building swaying Insanely cool earthquake like Japan39s live we39d dead omg would hate building wonder many motion sickness building answer friend blowing wind I39d shitting pant top floor Amazing Engineering Building standard Nomura building 48th floor Thanks posting building probably make couple brownie people good architect 2008shiny Woah don39t even remember writing actually It39s okay structural dynamic better mine don39t really know much basic don39t know flagged spam maybe hater jealous knowledge xD jk TheJeleb Hmm interesting thk height structure determines whether inertia dominates stiffness damping Sry structural dynamic suck hard XD btw heck ur msg flagged spam 2008shiny Nope something remember looking text book long ago I39m fond earthquake geographical study TheJeleb u earthquake engineering mate seismic study idea building swayed much amazing well designed remember used design building big suspended weight top would sway counteract swaying building would stop toppling 2008shiny It39s structure probably something underground Interesting point though I39ll research dynamic response dissipates energy wonder specifically manged make sway
