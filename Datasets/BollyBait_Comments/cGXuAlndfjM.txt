😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 lol
Princess👸
I don&#39;t find her pretty ! But she has amazing glow I wanna know how ?
What’s the point wearing such outfit which gives you a headache and not comfortable at all. These fashion designers suck big time
😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😃😯😯👌🏻👌🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Just curious, but if she was going to wear this huge dress, it may have been okay to skip high heels, opting for comfortable shoes? The shoes don&#39;t show anyway?
Idar bhi socho darling deepika
❤❤😮💕🥰 👸
Which wax they are using??
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
🎉😂 beautiful
Dipika is soooooo beautiful and a brilliant acter of Indian sinema..
The dress is so preety and she is the preetiest ❤️

Как будто эти люди играют в куклу ...
She&#39;s so sweet ❤🌎<br>Love you Deepika 😍
She is looking like a barbie doll
I like her gown
The dress is quite nice... But she&#39;s looking weird. The hairstyle and particularly the makeup is awful and hideous
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVaiRiaps4c">https://youtu.be/OVaiRiaps4c</a>

She is lovely😍
Is it just me or did she look a tad bit similar to barbie in a fashion fairytale? She looks so good in that dress.
Love your look Deepika di
This dress so much beautifull😍
Great dress on a druggie.
Puri ready hone ke bazd bandaria lag rahi hai
Nice make up but she sometimes looks like bhoot copied Dua Lipa look
she shouldve been this year!!!!!
her hairstyle and lipstick color ruined her beauty, didn&#39;t fit her. She looked incredibly beautiful when her total hair was in a bun with the earrings
Indian women are naturally born with the hair, skin, eyes, curves we all want
She is looking really barbie
Just wow....
❤️
Beautiful &amp; attracted
top!
Yeah she really looked beautiful and glam without makeup and hair done
The dark lip darkened her too much!! They should have gone with a brighter lip to really brighten up her whole face and some skin toned highlighter!! Her face seemed way to dark after!! Also: HOW DID SHE PEE THAT NIGHT???
Phenomenal

This Outfit is perfect for 2022 Met Gala💓💓💓💓<br>But our QUEEN slayed it on that year too🥳🥳🥳🥳
Drop dead gorgeous 🔥♥️
This look would have been perfect for 2022 met theme Gilded Glamour.
Gosh the dress is holy amazing 😩😍
Rose also went
Wow what a dress and make over just admiring the style 😍
que bella mi flaca
What a dress🙈🙊🙊
The lipstick and eyeshadow is  bit Low like they should make her more sweet but she looked gorgeous
She looked like a Barbie
She look more beautiful in open hair... The stylist could make her more beautiful but-
Am I the only one who got Ariana Grande vibes
She totally look like a &quot;witch&quot;😏
Who else is waiting to see her 2022 met Gala look
OMG she is stunning
Queen
Ranveer singh should have came, It would have been ICONIC
At this time deepika&#39;s eyebrows were not as lifted as now. Now her eyebrows looks double the time lifted and gorgeous when I saw her interview in THE BOMBAY JOURNEY, mashable India. Her eyebrow professional has done really good job with her eyebrow lifting.
She is full of grace...very grounded but she looks like a hanger..!skeleton bodies are not in these days
She looked amazing!  What a great bubbly personality!
I see u green colour
Omg I love her so much 😭❤️‍🔥
She definitely pulled it off with graces
Dress is realy amaizing
Terrible eyeshadow and Lipstick choice. She is prettier than that.
Dress looks good but she is nothing like aishwarya or priyanka
Her personality 😍😍
She looks so beautiful 😍😍

Jnu ma maja kari
She is so energetic...
Looking like birsa munda after makeup

Glad we have someone amazing representing us Indians 💕
Ye gala kaun h bhai
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKCD7VaSMajUhCvKf4cU-g">https://youtube.com/channel/UCDKCD7VaSMajUhCvKf4cU-g</a>
She’s a vision omg
Woww💜
her lipstick tho
She is beautiful but I don’t like the purple/pink eyeshadow.
I love how she talks about Ranveer and the way Ranveer talks about her!! Made for each other ❤️
On the Kapil Sharma show, she said that after wearing these long dresses, you have to keep some people with yourself . I thought she was joking, but now it is clear that was true.
Zac is looking so kind so calm he is really such a great artist 🍭💗
BOLYWOOD AR PAGLI,RUBISH
The year Deepika was a part of Met gala, was the best Met gala for me. No doubt why my Indian friends call her a Queen.
I knew it that only when you put the lipstick the make-up is complete but today I got the demo too. And a love the fact that Cinderella  music when she was  on the carpet
she gives me Ariana grande vibes with the personality, the ponytail, and the poses I GET ARI VIBES YALL
Our Barbie 😭
Deepika is the best in Bollywood. Humble and classy!
Deepika overdoes everything so people don’t know what to focus on
ITS MUCH BETTER WITH CHOPRA MANY HAVE NOT SEEN IN MET GALA !
Oh my god hindi is so complicated language I can&#39;t understand their single word untile they started to speak in english. At first I was hearing just &quot;kachu machu pichi hae ooodbdbnsajnsb he he he&quot;
I swear whoever made that dress deserves an award!!!
Deepika and ranveer are so cute man. <br>And watching Deepika and Priyanka together is a bliss. Both beautiful Indian ladies 💖.
She is the most beautiful woman in the world ❤️
Have to show full make up .. can’t show whole tutorial makeup lol.. have to show her true face can’t show her true colour face lmao
Indian beauty 😍✨
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fhJsrV4d6Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fhJsrV4d6Y</a>

She is such a beautiful woman like Barbie  🥰
Bhutani
How can someone hate her she&#39;s the most real and adorable person i have come across 😭✨
Her hair looks exquisite! Beautiful dress💕
At first she wear that dress without makeup looking naturally very beautiful. After that over makeup in her eyes are look like plastic doll eyes.

I wish for just once I could do that. The hair and makeup and dress. It’d be the greatest day/night ever.
Bollywood cinema white+white lady boys no black man Indian cinema no equality 🤔?(NB Bollywood cinema no equality 🙄?)
Too much bronzer and wrong lip color
Proud to be INDIAN
Looking so beutifull ❤️
Raveer should attend met gala... Seriously man
How bad her accent is!
katrina is more beautiful than deepika..
Wow I&#39;m so proud of her
Her hair gives me gigi vibes
Cute vogue with deepu.
Why do I feel like this is priyanka chopra and not deepika padukone
i was here
the dress is incredible
Woww Deepika
Without heels shes already freaking tall with heels shes F-ING tall and I&#39;m jealous of her height😭
Not bored of watching it repeatedly
Danm he rode her for free for SIX yrs? how embarassing to mention! Doesn’t she even understand what she’s saying.
She looks gorgeous as always!❤❤🥺
Wow
Gigi Hadid’s hair inspiration for 2021 met gala is this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGXuAlndfjM&amp;t=301">5:01</a> &quot;One look is Bra and Panty&quot; HAHAHAHA LOL WTF Lady Gaga ke lag gaye! It&#39;s not &quot;Bra and Panty&quot; on the MET GALA, it&#39;s loungerie! &quot;Bra and Panty&quot; is so middle class! LMAO
Queen 👑
Le Kapil sharma😂 ranveer dulhaniya le gayi 😂😂
She looks like a princess
She was looking good but that eye look was not suiting her dress actually
Worst look.ever
The dress is gorgeous, may be she should have gone without that weird makeup, especially hair
Maal hai kya ? 😂😂😂😂😂
She Doesn&#39;t need any Makeup, So much Beauty
I really like hear india accent 😂
nice video.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23magnifique333">#magnifique333</a>
Met don&#39;t want to down their reputation that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t invite these crackheads this year 🤣🤣🤣
21 million views this is power of Indian actress 👏🥰
Even without making up she is so stunning then!
OMG 😍this dress is so pretty 😍💗

Missed her !!!!!!!!
Amazing amazing queen

This is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool!
Deepika looks stunning💖 but why such a bold lipstick 🙄
Iski husband ko ye outfit jyada suit karega sayad.. 😂😂😂
Rubbish Styling…
Waoo wat a fab dress
Now this is called the Met Gala Look!!
This year Gigi Hadid did kinda same look in black n white
She&#39;s looks like kendall jenner 😊
can people sit in this kind of dresses or they go through the whole event while standing...... just curious
Did she meet Rosé blackpink?? Bc She was also there
Da heck Deepika met Rosè
I think Gigi&#39;s recent Met Gala look is somewhat similar to Dipika&#39;s
💜💜💜
Did the Indian accent really need subtitles? Lmao, Vogue making Indians feel as if the English spoken here was unintelligible.
She looks like Ariana grande in this one
She is sooooooo pretty ❤️❤️
no Priyanka, no Deepika, no Ranveer for MET 2021....disappointed
I dunno why some  indian feeling so bad if somebody speaks in other accent all countries learn skills tat how to speaks in other accent but if an indian try to speaks in other accent some rookie indians be like awww she&#39;s speaking in aa faaaaake accent but in reality they always says this legendary dialogue man cause they can&#39;t speaks in other accent. well kpop alll artist used to speak in american accent but koreans don&#39;t have any kinda issue man they are not like yuh. indians who r changing their thinking about accent are so cooooool . some Indians who still do fake accent fake accent are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23waa">#WAA</a> ,means worried about accents
She was invited this year too, but couldn&#39;t go because of her so so busy schedule. She&#39;s continuosly shooting for 3 films simultaneously. Super hectic schedule.<br>Missed her!!

The worst dress of met gala
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGXuAlndfjM&amp;t=40">0:40</a> cute reaction 😍
She was one of the best dressed at this event hands down😍😍😍. Stuck to the theme in an elegant and beautiful manner.
Indian designer should design more fashionable dresses...
So pretty
She doesn&#39;t know what camp is
The biggest thing i don&#39;t like is her  lipstick i feel like if they make like heavy gown and heavy hair then shimmery eye look so they have to put light lip shade for her whole look maybe something like pink red mixture or add lip glosses
Padu padu
What was the theme for this gala?
What a pleasure it would be to dress such a leggy lass. ❤️
She is looking like as angel
I am a 10 years old girl and I am your big fan .... I want to meet you ... You are so beautifull . I will also try to be an actress .. You also look nice in movies And your dance and meakup is also very nice ... If my dream is possible then I will be very happy ...
omg shes the best
..lol
That&#39;s why,  i like deepika more than priyanka. 😁

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGXuAlndfjM&amp;t=40">0:40</a> she made a high frequency sound because of excitement 😂

Churail witch preaparation
Oh my goodness...  I want that dress...😍😍😍
Who is doing her makeup
Drugeeeee
She was my Favourite but I hate her only because she chose wrong side only to promote her film. It was not a wise decision.
She looked more beautiful when she tried her dress for the very first time without any makeup and hairstyle!
Hey Barbie Shantipriya💗💗
Who else is thinking exactly &quot;why on earth did YouTube recommend me this video?&quot;
Amazing
Weebee phobea is right, why so difference between them both
I love the dress but the hair just ruined it
Deepika Padukone  like  a Princess
She is so cute

مرحبا كيفكم
This tells me how much actresses have to go through to look so gorgeous every single day. The way she said about having to take a headache medicine and applying numbing cream to her feet so that she doesn&#39;t feel pain... is very sad!!
I came here to hear her talk
Red colours
I wish her make up was not this much!<br>She would have look more prettier with less make up!😊
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGXuAlndfjM&amp;t=53">0:53</a> When she said art, my mind is &quot;yeh art hai art&quot; <br>Only Indians 🇮🇳 can understand this! 😂
Why does her face remind me of Young Madonna at certain times?
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGXuAlndfjM&amp;t=348">5:48</a> that was so cute the way she was walking ☺♥️ and sipping some coke😂🔥
B n D r j h
she  said the word &#39;literallay &#39; many many times.
Deepika is looking too beautiful, <br>Her dress is best
She is looking like a princess
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Nice deepu
She is such a beauty 💓💓
Iqra Aziz ?<br>Somebody understand hit like
She is worst ever
How to sit while in that dress
Less makeup and different hairstyle would have been better for the dress ..

The rare bowl virtually sign because softdrink consequentially curve than a embarrassed tights. acoustic, conscious space
She is so attractive
It&#39;s beautiful
No kidding about the barbie part
Dress is beautiful but makeup and hairstyle didn&#39;t justice that gown
Ranveer must&#39;ve envied Deepika for the dress. Nuff said!
Her hubby is joker indeed sindhis are over dresses with lot of jazz 😂😂😂😂

Accent is subjective. You can model it however you like. It isn’t about ‘abandoning your indian roots’ wtf does that even mean? First off, there is no indian accent. I’ll talk however tf I want. Stop hating on people who don’t have an indian accent. It’s toxic.
Being a celebrity is really so tough❤️
😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
She is queen deepi
Hmmmmm🧐🧐🧐🙄🙄🙄
girls actually take a lot of time to get dressed........
Wow nice makeup👌👌😍

Sorry i don&#39;t like the make up is very scary and the dress is too mush....
Zac Posen ahhhh I esp loved him on project runway
Shes beautiful. I love how sincere and humble. The gown is gorgeous. I love how she said that its not just a dress its art. Fashion sure is art
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>I m single boy<br>Surat  Gujrat
How can she sit.. Or it&#39;s a standing dress🤣
what i want to know is how do these guys sit?
beauty does not require make-up, dress or any artificial thing we use, its rather a natural thing. Even a little girl of a town who has not even listen about showbiz looks more beautiful than these kind of stunts performed by female actors,  wearing massive dresses and other stuff. These people are rented by cosmetic and fashion companies to business, not for the well being of society
queen i’m ur biggest fan 🖖🏻
Lipstick dark ha
Everything was nice except her hair
beautiful women wid dumb n stupid hair do .....

Deepika is the best girl,

Wait. I JUST LOVE THAT MAKEUP. I&#39;m more towards a natural makeup thingy but, her makeup was just sooo. What do I say? Eye catchy 😭
She&#39;s so beautiful :)
who else think the makeup ruined the beautiful dress?
Her reaction to the dress was so mixed that even Zac Corsen was confused.
The way she speaks about Ranveer is love 💗

“Some young women confuse their self-worth with their ability to attract the attention of men, and so pour all their energies into makeup, clothing, and jewelry. If only they realized that virtue, honor, and self-respect are the marks of a true beauty.”<br>― Epictetus

Is dress ko pehenne k baad toilet lag gaya to Kya karte hai?
Everything is fine. But if you need someone else for holding your dress. How&#39;s that even okay?. I mean you need a person only for holding your dress. That sounds soo dependent!!!..  Though I loved that dress. She looked pretty.!!!
She literally looks like an angle
Yeh bhosdiwali paisose aish Kar Rahi hai Iski maaka Bhosda  ...!!! Humne Faltume ispe time waste Kiya!!!
Dress and her own look itself is better than the make up

Why is makeup allowed in modelling?? when calculator is not allowed in exam halls, drugs are not allowed on Cricket/ football field...  🙄!!!!
Cheao look.not elegant
Perhaps Ranveer Singh was not invited to Met Gala cuz they knew he would take all the spotlight of the day (no offence to any celebrity just my opinion)
I remembered that before being an actress she was a supermodel so she’s familiar with all the routine of working with designers
Dream girl♥️♥️♥️♥️ just like in om shanti om♥️♥️😌
&quot;Maal Hai Kya &quot;
I think she looks more beautiful without makeup.....<br>wt u guys think 🤔🤔
I like deepika without any make up
She looks good without makeup  and cute with denim dress
Drug didi😂😂😂😂😂
If you are reading this I hope you are a future millionaire 🙏 😀
Don&#39;t bash her for her beautiful look and outfit. This is exactly what &quot;camp&quot; is! It&#39;s all over-the-top and exaggerated. Look at her exaggerated eye makeup and hairstyle. The Barbie-like dress is designed in a way to give it a 3-dimensional look.
The dress omg 😭😭😭😭❤️

What would there make up cost.....🤪🤪😆😆🤔🤔?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGXuAlndfjM&amp;t=41">0:41</a><br>Reaction of the man😎
Ur hairstyle ruined u totally
That dress was so beautiful on her,its so well made,it flows with her...she looks like a personified lotus.<br>This would have been perfect for almost any other red carpet,but The Met Gala has a theme,and i don&#39;t think the dress did it justice...on the other hand she did look near perfect and the fan in me could not help but squeal with happiness 😘
She is looking so stunning 😍😍 and obviously like sleeping beauty (Disney, berbie)....❤️❤️😍😍
So beautiful 😙😍😍 maybe you&#39;re miss univers
chilling with our money..wahh
Ugly af
Movie tamil please
Inlogo ko Actor kon bana ta hein ce ?
Met gala is known for bizzare dressup..  I know she&#39;s looking beautiful but its a impropriet dress up according to competition.. I don&#39;t think priyanka should be troll for her dressup.. Cause she dressup according to theme..she&#39;s already miss world.. She know what to wear where..
How do they handle these kind of dresses..... I can&#39;t even handle my jeans all the time I use to pull it up by jumping even publicly.... I am comfortable in lower and the shirt.... People around me are always like tumhara kuch ni ho sakta
Nice
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGXuAlndfjM&amp;t=53">0:53</a> art hai art <br><br><br>Kuch yad aya 😂

She really looks like a Barbie ❤️❤️
She is literally looking like an angel
After so much makeup and so much expensive dress they look like this 🤪🤪🤪
Awesome what a beauty
I wonder how did he manage to sit in that dress ?

Deep talking about her love life was the most cutest part of this video.<br>Deepveer forever.
Good
Wooooow. Stunning shapes and colour 😍😍😍 Perfect to enhance her beauty
ok I wish someday i will be a celebrity
Is that the designer beside Deepika, he is just ❤❤😘😘
My hairs will fall so badly if i do anything like this to them
Deepika looks like barbie doll.. You are my favorite 👍👍👍💖💖
Why does she always wear full face even in the start when she saw her dress
Deepika has a natural beauty ✨ please don&#39;t ruin her look by adding lots of products bcoz it ruins her original beauty. Anyway she is looking like a BARBIE doll😘
the way the designer looks at her omg🥺
She can just wear block heels which  are more comfortable and gives desired height instead of those painful high pencil heels and using numbing cream...<br>Anyway those heels aren&#39;t showing in that gown... <br>Makes sense haina?
I just love her dimple .......
Cool
