She is the most beautiful woman ❤❤❤❤
I like the way Deepika speaks, expresses her thoughts in a simple English. My purpose is to learn her style, her way of speaking confidently as I am on the journey to be fluent in spoken English by Elite Talkers. Thank u so much Deepika Mam and Anupama Mam. Already liked and subscribed this channel 👍.
How did deepika learn to act?
We live in Chandigarh.
We have two babies ,one son and one daughter.we are I ,tarun Jain and harnaaz kaul sandhu
My wife is harnaaz kaul Sandhu as Miss universe 2021.
You are not in real life. You are an image only .
😂🤣 तू अब पागल हो गया
अबे तुम्हारा नसल खत्म करने के लिए कर रहे थे my bad luck 😂🤣
She looks too exhausted after lockdown. Hope she&#39;s ok,eager for her interview.
Deepika is soooo cute baby<br>Doll
Shes defo a brand more than an artist. If shes was more of a artist she wouldnt do movoes like pathan, chennai express, fighter shes would do more movies like piku, padmavat, bajirao mastani, movies with roles that are interesting and complex.
Art &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brand
Her voice and body language is therapeutic
Deepika ❤️
This is definitely one of her best looks (hair+makeup) till date... she looks so lovely in this one.
Strong personality ❤️
I like Deepika very much. Fell in love with her charm after watching her film Padmavati 💛
Deepika Madam looks like our senior Kannada actress Kalpana Madam...

Deepika padukone one of the my favourite actress her style dressing sense outstanding and her dimple and her smile all&#39;s my favourite gyz love you deepika
Tall ND beautiful 😍 girl
host looks so beautifull
Deepika is so amazing and so humble at the same time! <br>As a film director, I’ve a script for her and I wish I could reach her!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHWrsTWR0xA&amp;t=295">04:55</a> cut to 2021 where Deepika had deleted all her photos on Insta and only posts contents with DEEPIKA PADUKONE brand name on every reel, post charity work she does. Hardly any personality showing on social media but all about Brands!
So lovely and beautiful ❤️

THE WAY I LOVE THIS WOMAN, LITERALLY THE LOVE OF MY LIFE TILL MY LAST BREATHE !!!!!!!!!!!!
Fat fat 😂😂
Cute
As a Kannadiga myself belonging to the Konkani community of Karnataka, I m proud to see a Kannada Konkani person Deepika Padukone from my native Udupi to reach these heights.
Bahut sexy
Yeah sure we want YJHD 2
Deepika Padukone is very clear in her conversation. She is resonating more with her clearer perspective.
38-meet-13
I like Ranveer Singh but I don&#39;t like her. She has used her break-up story to climb the ladder of fame and prosperity. Even when she was engaged she made bizzare statements about ex-boyfriend boxers, how important he is in her life still and how much she&#39;s possessive and protective about RK. She sounds very fake and superficial.
May u lead a good life
Women are not safe especially in india...u have great backing to live such a beautiful life..
Congratulations and blessings to u deepika..u look great with all jewelry and clothing..more happiness and blessings..to u..lucky girl
just want to say i love u sooo much deepika....u are amazing....actually I have lost count of watching your interviews...it is just lovely
If it is not budget related you wud call piku small
How do you empower people. Bullshit
Look at the spark  in her eyes❤️❤️🤩beauty with brain❤️she always steals my heart 💖 with the expression and emotions which she show through her eyes....😍 Love u Lots DP
Anupama Chopra is one of the most pleasant and respectful interviewer I&#39;ve seen. She&#39;s so polite and patient and also she doesn&#39;t ask any unwanted question about her guest&#39;s personal life. She focuses just on the filmography and the body of work that they have. Lots of love❤️
She used to say these two words in every <br><br>&quot;I think&quot;<br>&quot;You know&quot;<br><br>But that sounds good
Such GORGEOUS eyes
Most beautiful woman inside out
I&#39;ve noticed this, Deepika&#39;s complexion has got fairer, she had a wheatish complexion earlier, it was visible in her initial movies too, I think she has got skin whitening treatment and Kajol too.

Who is come for  learn English
why Indians try to speak in English.<br>There&#39;s American British And Australian English<br>and then there&#39;s Indian English. Their English sucks. <br>English learners shouldn&#39;t watch indian interviews.
Amazing Super Fantastick
Deepika ko pehle koi nasha karva do. Varna iski gand fat jayegi.

Always I feel like  depika is one of my family member..... she z so cute...
Cute girl 🤩
I like her features so much
Sindhis must be knowing wht &quot;phath phath&quot; is😂😂
You never realise when mask falls , somebody can be -<br>Drugie<br>Anti-Nationalist<br>Opportunistic<br>Movie-stealer for joker husband<br>5 crores ( if you all know)<br>Depression Queen <br>Milks money out of somebody’s suicide( for her so called organisation)<br>Ashamed of this Woman.
How does her films ‘Empower People’ ? BIG JOKE.
You keep on listening to Deepika and at end Realise she speaks nothing substantial and everything said is so cliche. Boring and Non-opinionated woman. Plays safe , diplomatic and tries to be politically-correct. She is Overrated Basically.
She is so beautiful ,smart I respect her jobs her films.her films is something   her roles  plays with  hard
Deepika 👌
She reminds me of a beautiful doe
She&#39;s too vulnerable for my taste
Before trolling people, first keep yourself in that position and think how would you have   felt if you were in that position..<br>Mostly, without knowing the whole truth judging people is not acceptable.
nshedi 😂
We heard that Deepika takes drugs? Is it true?
This druggie !
Deepika is such a beautiful person outside..and ...inside such a druggeee ..charsi...person..
Konsa drungs chahiye aapko?🤣
I see all videos. Deepika Padukone and also follow Deepika Padukone but ab nhi yr kyu tumne drugs le
Ohh god drugiiieee
Those people criticise her accent,her command on English is 5 times better then them😏😏
Druggie!
Nice
Fath fath is a Sindhi word for haphazard manner😂
Its okay to be politically corrected specially around country’s leading parties who wants you to be  their poppet . I appreciate that you went to JNU to look around utilising Country’s democracy. Though I’m not supporting any group here. Deepika is a wise and thoughtful apart she’s gorgeous 💕
💙❤💜💛💚
QUEEEEEN DEEPIKA💗
Such a fake woman!

All these film personalities come with brown skin and in few years become very fair. Thanks to skin lightening treatment
She looks insanely beautiful here... The eyes.. 😍
Dusky skin to light skin...wow deepika!
Take a shot, eveytime she says &#39;I think&#39;
Can we take a moment to admire how beautiful she is ❤️
Why doesn&#39;t Anupama lose weight?
Exceptionally Beautiful
Deepika madam , being cool , have been sweet voice.. did wonderful interaction.
I don&#39;t watch TV and movies but I love interview and songs of Aishwarya Rai and Deepika . srk ❤️ Salman😍🤗🔥❤️
Hey Anupama.. You are such a good interviewer!! I mean, I am watching all the interviews on FC just because of you.  I simply adore the way you ask the questions! ❤️
and this fake laugh of interviewer.
Deepika deserves a lot of respect as an actor in the Bollywood industry <br>She even can pursue further into Hollywood for her talent in acting :)

Maine interview poori sun lyi but mujhe kuch b smjh mein nahi Aya <br>Ku k mujhe English nahi aati
The interview was amazing. And daily routine was very good.she is such a say person
Both could have talked little louder.
Truth words
So much focus on someone&#39;s beauty......can we really go past that!!
Love you dipika from inside my heart
She is a real actores of this film industry
She never ceases prove to me that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication 😍
Mam, how much money do they take for each interview? Or any idea can you share please?
How many women as Deepika padukone ?
She is extremely beautiful.😍😍
Just look at this face!!!! <br>DEEPU! 🥺♥️😍♥️😩♥️😭♥️🤩
What do you think
The word &quot;Phat-phat&quot; actually means being in extreme hurry.
I love her soo much ❤️❤️
I love you Dipika you are so beautiful
Just because one is not eloquent, it does not mean they are not intelligent, deepika is a intelligent woman she is balanced  she is strong and she is mature I like others. She overcame her horrible relation with ran bir . She has worked hard to be where she is and proofed she is worth it, and here to stay. Happy for deepika☺
Super Girls and Actor
Only sindhis can understand  path  path
I think you not shy person, Deepika🤔You are not the &quot;shy woman&quot; type. You only limit between personal and work, Maintaining the way of speech🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ That&#39;s you, Deepika😏You are a brave woman, if a shy woman, will not make a tattoo on her body🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️ Because shy woman is a character who is very sensitive to herself and maintain her body properly😌I am disappointed when you make a tattoo😟I&#39;m sure you were wrong in maintaining your body a long time ago. Maybe now you regret the tattoo on your body, because now you always cover your tattoo with makeup🤨because permanent tattoos are very difficult to remove😥 think RK has ruined you a long time ago😤 but I am happy now that you have chosen the right man for you👍🤧 but i love you now🥰🥰🥰
I think we get so much influenced by Bollywood celebrities we look them as insppiration .and thats fine but choose correctly because whoever you are folllowing should be choosen correctly
Always loving. calm .beautyful . Confident
She is such a beauty..so simple and calm..no pride..full of respect for everyone..she is not trying to be better than anyone..she is just herself..hope she stays as she is..
Woman who is a<br>Zodiac Capricorn really wants everything to look perfect before her eyes. She likes cleaning, she doesn&#39;t like dirty atmosphere🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️Because I experienced it at home, because my sister is also a Capricorn🤭😁😝 And get a Zodiac Cancer husband (the same as Ranveer zodiac)😉This zodiac if put together, is very compact👍 because Cancer zodiac likes to joke, not many requests and understandings😊 then meets the Capricorn zodiac who is very clever. Very suitable👌👌👌😘The Zodiac Capricorn has a &quot;powerful&quot; nature
What a personalities .... Nice talking with simplicity, no any attitude , like most actress has ....
Love u depika
I love you Princess!!!
Thank you so much, Deepika Ji, So why not, I like your blog review and video, good conversation with Anupama Chopra<br>       You are right today&#39;s life is very hard to maintain every day because of its necessary to make fulfill all the people who are looking for us one type of multiple businesses.<br>      Yeah, all over happy with the world around me so I feel fresh.<br>     I am very glad to see you again because your blog is always wanted and waiting for granted and chance.<br>     So glad to meet you in this interview, thank you.
Queen ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
She has a dusky skin color .why does she have to paint herself white .what&#39;s wrong with showing your natural skin color.
Mam what about interviewing gulzar shahab?
Though m not a fan,but I think she is one of the few actresses who don&#39;t put on a fake accent while speaking and I think that is something admirable, because these days a lot of actors and actresses put on a fake accent while speaking for any xyz reason and believe me,fake accents are really cringeworthy to hear!! because nothing like sounding original while being comfortable in your own skin while speaking!.kudos to her for that
I salute the Deepika ornamented in her own virtues. Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.
owo
Such a boring and unnecessarily diplomatic personality 😕😒
I love how natural she is 💙💙..not trying to being anyone else and so calm❤❤
How much did she bleach her skin? Looks creepy
the brightness in this video hurt my corneas
Deepika is extremely beautiful
I think i think i think i think the convo always starts and  ends with it :D anyways i love her just the way she is . Always with maturity but this i think is to much :D
What&#39;s her lipstick shade?😂 It&#39;s so pretty
Do😇❤️😍😘
She is the most versatile actress
Love u dipu....
Anupam Chopra while talking to your guests why do you every time keep giving reference to the questions which your guests have already answered in some other programs.anupama frame your own questions pls
Why is she so damn adorable? Look at this woman -she&#39;s freaking out over idly day!
She is so pretty
Glad watched it at 1.5× speed
who&#39;s is a better actress her or kangana?
Deepika is like ross from friends.
why do people hate Deepika Padukone soo much I mean just look at her she is so kind , lovely in nature better than the other actresses who have lots of attitude like Anushka sorry but I found Anushka very rude ,  and Deepika she is so sweet .How did people forget that once she was betrayed by her bf ranbir she loved him so  deeply but he was unlucky who cheated on her for that Katrina , she suffered frm depression and I can understand that what phase she has gone through  in her life though I never ever suffered frm depression but I know how does it feel when u go through it but she is still lovely and I am happy that she has finally found a person who loves her frm his deep heart and adore her .
Look at her poise and eyes, its a glimpse of paradise.
Why she changed her skin tone from brown to white seriously this is how to empower other young indian girls
Anyone after deepveer&#39;s marriage!?
priyanka is the only brown beauty n better actress than deepika fake white rabbit !
Awww i love you Deepika! She&#39;s so simple at heart and such a genuine, beautiful soul!
Deepika i just love u😍😍😍
Yes  dipu  is  strong woman
Dipu  is  a strong  woman
my first and last favourite actress of Bollywood. Deepika really inspires me to do my best in whatever I&#39;m doing in my field.
Why anupama is just overacting nd speaking..  😂😂😂lol
Deepika can&#39;t speak English properly
She is sad inside
Kitna pot k aai hai bhai
She rocks♥️
Really good interviewer
MS DEEPIKA PADUKONE I APPOINT YOU AS MY GURU FOR BRAIN BADMNTON: I KNOW YOU ARE NOT THE TYPE WHO AWAITS GURU DAKSHINA BUT YOU GET A QUICK SKETCH FROM ME IF YOUR GRACIOUS HIGHNESS DEEMS TO ACCEPT IT: ACCHA?
I didn&#39;t understand what she wanted to convey with some answers ghuma diya
After i see lot of change in her <br>Skintone way of talking <br>Anyway i lve her 😜
Loved her...so honest and poised.
She is so truthful..She is so rightly understood her flaws and corrected it...
That shyness is beauty
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHWrsTWR0xA&amp;t=1357">22:37</a> love this part
Hiii Deepika i am a big fan of u i like ur smile and speech a lot expecting a film from south star like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23vijaydevarakonda">#VijayDevarakonda</a> who isvery famous in Telugu states as well as Tamil
wow she is soo beautiful💕💓
Deepika Padukone is the prettiest barbie doll Bollywood has ever seen. She looks better than half percentage of the entire population in this world. Seriously, she has the best features that one requires to look beautiful... Huge almond eyes, pointed nose, medium lips, heart shaped face, healthy hair, tall height, flawless skin and overall looks like a doll. 🧚🏻 Just Wow......
love the interview
my best actress.... she is truly amazing actress... happy Marriage Deepika g... may you live happy and save... may prayers for you...
Self righteous bore!! Am sure no one finished this interview lol. It&#39;s funny when she refers to herself as an artiste!
beauty&#39;s with brain ☺simply called DEEPIKA 😘😘. Her eyes r sooo........gorgeous..it always hitting ma heart ❤..
I felt she is seeker of I, ME and MYSELF. There is no WE.
Deepika is simply great. She is doing what she wants. She is an iconic actor in Bollywood
I feel she is fine. Not bad. I liked her in cocktail, yeh jawani hei dawani, Chennai express, even bajirao, piku and all. I feel she acted well. Even in padmaavat she acted well. Especially Holi song in the film. I don&#39;t think anyone could have played Veronica in cocktail and Naina yjhd better. She&#39;s good yaar. Why don&#39;t we appreciate the talent we have. She is calm and chooses her words wisely. I think the media made her like that . Anyway I feel she&#39;ll be more uninhibited now that ranveer is marrying her. She feeds off his energy. And not everyone needs to be loud and energetic in interviews
Hmse bni h tu log dekhte h bus ThTs why kon h tu jyada bolti h ye chepuuu khi ki😂😂
I just hate this lady front of deepika in last interview isne ranveer ko jyada boldia  bhai bc for that I just hate this lady😠😠👎 btw love u ranveer nd deepu
Ranbir surely didn&#39;t deserve her..with due respect to him
Looking extremely  fair
Deepika..i love you but  I hope you stop criticizing the way Ranveer dressed in every silly interview for you. Look at yourself first and then talk. I know that the host must mention Ranveer Singh&#39;s  name to get rid of the boredom  but just stop.not funny
Ranbir Kapoor &amp; Deepika Padukone ❤❤
Aap ek relationship ki wajha see you weak feel Kar rahi Hain ,aapko Pyaar karney wale 1.5 crore log Hain in the world ,kisi ek ki wajha see aap Anna career kharab Kar logi Kya ,aap itne achche see baat karti ho itni beautiful dilhti ho pls aisa mat karo ma&#39;am ,we admire u ma&#39;am ......<br>Aap aise Bollywood see call jaogi to I&#39;ll never comment on your videos 😔😥and I&#39;ll never like also 😔😔😔it&#39;s an anger of your fan and I&#39;ll keep showing it ......<br>Sorry if u felt bad ....

I love you Deepika
Oh gorgeous lady 💕💕😍
3.36 Deepika ironically turns around the quite Anupama begins the interview with 😄. Just an observation. Nice interview, filled with thoughtful questions and interesting answers. I came here to watch two admirable ladies. This week I&#39;m among people who are still stuck in 1950s, so this kinda stuff inspires and empowers me to be and do more. Keep doing you!!
Yo tengo mujer  como tu Padukone muy Buena si quires tu Vida busca LA por yo bengo marcho queres esparar el tiempo tu conmigo gracias deepika
Deepika bht ache lagrahi hai her skin is glowing also so mch I knw she had done some treatment bcoz after padmavati her face was looking so dull no she is looking gorgeous she has doone somethngg I m daam sure
Tum ham ham tum
I never find her interview interesting. The only one interesting was when she spoke on coffee with Karan against ranbeer. I guess she lost it after that.....lolz
she&#39;s looking so beautiful
She makes absolutely no sense and she is daft but OMFG she is beyond gotdam beautiful. There is not a flaw on her perfect little face.  I&#39;m just here for the face, and  certainly NOT the interview. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23realtalk">#RealTalk</a>
This is what we call as a calm and calculated interview. Quality ..
These actors have their personal individual personalities.<br>It requires confidence to say the truth about how you are and what you like actually.<br>It may not appeal to all as every body wants strong actors to be in certain way like bold, outspoken and fearless maybe.<br>We have Priyanka, Kangana, kalki, swara  to name a few. They are like that in real life as well beacuse it&#39;s their personality.<br>But others may be different in real..A bit shy, emotional, not too bold like Deepika, Aalia, Vidya (she&#39;s mix and fun)<br>What really is important is how they pull  off themselves on screen as an actor.<br>And that should be our only concern as an audience. 😇
She is successful, beautiful and boring.
Omg...Deepika&#39;s interviews are soo boring...Never been bored with any other celebrity...
I subscribe because Deepika said.....❤❤❤❤
My favorite and my inspiration luv u deepika
Anu is one of d best interviewer ,she becomes very frank &amp; easily indulge herself into any conversation,she got very cute nature ,well deepika is talented , beautiful &amp; down to earth actor
that face!!! 😍😍😍😍
Is that a tatoo on deepika leg
very beautiful face😍 gorgeous deepika!
she is still in depression 😩
Read some of  the comments funny how everyone says she’s boring but probably watched the whole interview<br>U are what u are not every one is wild and crazy <br>She’s beautiful  and polite and that goes a long way <br>In a way she’s also like an Ambassador for  Indain so let’s not forget that is a very hard position <br>to be  @  where everyone is watching your  nx move<br>I’m from Ghana 🇬🇭 west Africa I say she represent India well indeed❤️👍
I subscribed coz of Deepika Padukone ♥♥♥😘 n i admire Anupama Chopra as well..♥✅
Exactly how I feel about social media, I mean if Deepika Padukone can feel low because of such things, obviously many people can. Moderation necessary!
Nice interview plz upload latest interview in english only.....
Yo gusto mucho the quero gracias Padukone khan
She&#39;s lucky to have a  lover boy in ranveer..
seriously men need to be protected?
Love u Deepika..nice video
She looks so fresh and happy
Deepika Padukone is very good she is really beautiful she is very confident in speaking I like her style when she speaks when she talks in Ghoomar song Padmavati 2018 she looks stunning super Deepika Padukone keep it up
She is and always be inspiration
&quot;I think&quot;
one of my fave interviews of her, she comes off so down to earth talking about her ideal day and love for stapling lol
Plz be natural for once. Just once.
the comments are telling she is only success full because of ranveer.  so mean first of all films go through actors hand but ranveer said in one interview best actress is anuska but after his successes with deepika continously his taste change sorry he is very funny type and very quick type and answers so fast even not thinking he is brilliant actor that&#39;s agree but he dressr
Anupama + interview = great
Best celebrity 🤗🤗👍👍 ✌ ✌ <br>That&#39;s why I like deepika 😍
कितने लोगोके साथ ये घुमी है .  लिस्ट बडी है....................ha  ha  haa.....
&quot;I think&quot; to the power 1000 like in every interview..
Deepika looks so beautiful here and this was so far the best interview of Deepika I feel. Kudos to Anupama👍🏻
Deepika comes across such a humble and grounded person.... Wish her more success!!
How does she looks here.. make me laugh!! 😂😂😂 in real she is very ugly ver very Dark... Mahakaali.. shit face.. just bcz of 100 kg make looks fair.. adrwise she is ugly as hell..
I don&#39;t think story of Padmaavat didn&#39;t run the flim in box-office. It&#39;s all about being viral, if your flim is viral then people will go to cinema Hall for watching movie. Somehow you will get the best movie tag.
Too many &quot;I think&#39;s&quot;, otherwise    gud interview.
Please make yeh jawaani hai deewani 2 deepika and Ranbir u both are bestiie
Good
Deepika is such a down to earth lady...admire her for that!
The Dynamic DUO!!!LOL!!!YAWN!!!
Boring me to death!!! That interviewer has not a clue and nor does she???So sue me moneybagz??LOL
This book is written by me.Kindly download for free, read and give me your valuable suggestions for my upcoming edition.<br>Kindly share so it can reached to maximum.
Is anybody counting, &quot;I think&quot; ? Love you Deepika 💗💗💗
I think I think I think I think....😁😂
🖒🖒🖒🖒
How can somebody be this much beautiful.. Deepika ❤️❤️❤️
I hate him
My favourite Deepika always rocks
Deepika does not have one intelligent thing to say. Such a pity.
Deepika is very boring in person
Love You Deepika Padukone
How has she become so fair? She was never this <a href="http://pale.skin/">pale.skin</a> lighting?
Deepika is a core South Indian girl at heart like Aishwarya Rai, Hemamalini, Rekha, Asin, Vidya Balan and late Sridevi. She is reserved!
Deepika is such a beautiful person INSIDE and OUT 💗
I love Deepika but her ideas are never original. Somebody would have said it earlier and she would just repeat it. Example, pay disparity. <br><br>Deepika’s success graph inspires me but Anushkha and Kangana are definitely better actors than her.
I&#39;ve never seen Deepika open up like this ❤ so nice to know that she loves decluttering stuff too 😅 good job Anupama ! ❤
Bahoot bahtrin khub chali hawa ye kisne mangi duwa karke jo chali diwani tu pass aaja mere pass hai pani darling deepiyanka
I honestly feel like crying. It&#39;s been so long, why isn&#39;t she getting any offers? She now is openly talking about how she wants to do light-hearted movies or comedies yet no director is interested? I love Deepika, she is the only reason I am still watching Bollywood movies but it feels like her career has effectively ended, which makes NO sense!
is deepika bleaching her skin? I hope not. She is very pretty.
Such a beautiful  mind such a beautiful  being... Godbless❤
I did not hear you asking ranveer singh, questions about marriage rumours and home maker and all that in the post-padmaavat interview. Why to Deepika then?
Deepkia got a beautiful smile but just average looks... don&#39;t know why she&#39;s so popular.
Can&#39;t take my eyes off her even for a moment -SO BEAUTIFUL!!
Such a boring interview
Anupama&#39;s questions are so intelligent ! I would&#39;ve been stumped (like Deepika but she hid it well lmao)
She&#39;s very oversmart
I just watched Tamasha, It is the best movie of deepika.
Karnataka babe
She&#39;s so beautiful. I would do anything to meet with her. She is my woman crush everyday. 😍😍😍😍❤️
naina talwar is inside her, i can see that!
I I I I I my my my.   So selfish.  I think.  I feel I am.....
Deepika gorgeous beauty..live deepika great performer wow wow look at her stunningness can&#39;t take my eyes of her❤👍
She looks so cuteeee
Preity zinta interview please anupama. She is cofounder and succesful business worman. Anupama, its women empowerment and she is still doing one off so please do one during ipl or post ipl. Don&#39;t disappoint us.
10 mins interview was dragged to 20 mins because of deepika lagging and doing slow motions 😂
Look at her complexion 😲
I love you deepika from morocco😍😘
Everyone has their own talking style or way...She is  a good hearted person and so down to earth..She is real..that is more important..love u always DP
depika is so pretty she has an attrection....i love her expressions,her opersonality and everything which she has except ranveer singh <br>................
deepika is ugly..I c no charm in her...kaali bhaisa jaise to h.mere gao ki ordinary girls bhi esse aachi dikhti h..ha kuch lambi hai,par overall aishwarya ke 5% bhi nahi h... Allah meharbaan to gadha pahalwaan
Randi aurat...
Gosh...Anupama chopra is the most annoying host. The squeal and her laughter is so awkward and forced..it is not funny!<br><br>I know these people are film critics but they certainly seem to have favorites and interview the same celebrities repeatedly. There is no new content. <br><br>1 tip: There are other wonderful actors as well that people would love to hear from, so try that.
Fun and light film......ZNMD 2
Playing in 720p..just to watch her..my girl crush❤.
Deepika I love you !! But please reduce saying I think!! You say “I think” too much !! in every sentence😂
Yeh I do agree with Deepika&#39;s comment about people not doing romantic movies and are behind biopics.<br>I too waiting for another yeh jawani hai deewani as this movie was my favorite and I can watch it at any point of my free time.<br>Lots of love Deepika.<br>You seem to be calm and soughted.<br>Love doing stationary things and I m south India too
Just 2 words&quot;I Think&quot;😂😂😂
Nice Interview 🙂
One word : DEEPIKA<br>One word : &quot;OVER&quot; IN BOLLYWOOD ! HAHAHAHAHA
Every second word is &quot;think &quot; or &quot;maybe&quot;. Very annoying
So down to earth....the sole reason y i heart her........😘😘😘😘😘😘😘 n that smile though its worth some million dollarsssssss❤❤❤❤❤
She is beautiful inner and out
Best part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHWrsTWR0xA&amp;t=1209">20:09</a> <br>You are welcome 😄
U know dp I love you
She’s num  1 surely . But in padmavat she was just ordinary . Movie got hit coz of ranveer .she should do a complete solo movie like Kareena n priyanks have done .
I can’t omg THIS HAS TO BE HER BEST INTERVIEW TILL DATE. she was all out for others to hear, and oh just so lovely ❤️😭
YESSSSSSS TO <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yjhd2">#YJHD2</a>...!!!!
I don&#39;t hate Deepika, but her interviews are too boring. Too too boring, being just always politically correct is not the only option to entertain us. Also, we need people like Ellen or Kimmel or Fallon who are great hosts in the West and bring out the best of people, in their interviews.
I love you ...
Soooo boring.....she is lucky not a good actor like kangana sorry
Such a Bimbo
deepika I love you
She is always like.... i would not do this because my ethics... my roots... blah blah... how i been brought up. A person who is actually grounded and ethics concsious.. he/ she would not need to say it again n again... it just appears in ur actions. She just pretends.
The number of times she said “I think” in this interview is definitely more than I have in my whole damn life. Just saying.
This interview was the opposite of boring, she&#39;s so funny
I love your interviews.. u r the best Bollywood film interviewer.. u know how to ask the right questions, how to get answers from the person..
Awesome
She looks gorgeous.
love you deepika ❤
A shot everytime Deepika says I think..
She is so boring to talk to.
Nice interview<br>Beautiful Deepika😍😍😍
Anupama &quot;fun and light.. oh my god&quot; i said this in a high pitched voice... is this how they really are?? Deepika daily routine... im jelous
After watching Kangana Ranaut,every other interview seems soo boring and this one tops the list!!
&#39;i think&#39; is all i heard.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHWrsTWR0xA&amp;t=210">3:30</a> , talking abt kangana. quite a self centric view deepika. with power does come a responsibility. when you have a platform why not use it for betterment of many.<br><br> Kangana - 1 deepika - 0
Ohh god! So pretty
This interview is so boring...And why Deepika has to always think before saying anything..So correct ... Nothing new
She &quot;thinks&quot; too much.. very rehearsed interview!
I dont know but watching kangana is a learning experience in interviews... i guess deepika is overrated.. 4 her look n style .. yeah she is best in this.. bt acting wise .. 😑😕 .. padmavat did not hv any scope to show her talent.. she was the protagonist with the lesser screen space n histrionics...
She is such bliss to listen.... Humble, honest, no drama at all... Just pure!!
when the so called critics will be in such an awe of actors .... who will we ever have meaningful understanding cinema
Oh my God !! Deepika, we GET it..<br>&quot;that&#39;s the way you have been brought up&quot;...<br>Can this interview get any more boring ????
this precious human  &lt;3
the sound is realllyyy very low ..... increase the vol guys
รักพี่น้ะพี่ดิ๊ป ♥️👑
Omg.. stop hating on her. At least she is not stepping on other people and say something sensational for the heck of it. She spoke about her path and her preferences and the interview would not have seemed boring it you were to put your perception and expectation of her aside and simply watch.
Love you deepikaa
It&#39;s visible she is shy! But OMG she is so boring at giving interviews! In fact I found her pretty boring in Padmaavat no great difference from bajirao or ramleela ! She should not work with SLB again !
Deepika❤️😘😍
Interview of Bhuvan bam made your channnel famous.
She looks so beautiful here
Anupama is a great interviewer
Rajeev and Anupama always ask the same set of questions ..... !!!
God...did anupama know sunset boulevard...
Dipika you are   💖so down to earth this is first time i saw your interview please be always as you are talking like middle class girl you are inspiration to todays girl
When i look at this woman, i feel there is no one as beautiful and charming as her.. That smile and those dimples... ❤❤😍😍... And those eyes... She is beyond stunning..
her talking about idli so excitedly make my love for idli justified 😁😍❤❤ love this woman 😊
I still need to be impressed by her acting. The only thing I like about her is  her openness about depression and bringing awareness. She is definitely a brand though she doesn’t identity herself that way.
Anupama is so bad with interviewing !! she is asking whether u liked to be an artist or brand? really WTFFFF!
The best actress with the best critic😘
I just loved deepika in this interview. She&#39;s super successful yet so humble and easy going. Can&#39;t wait for her next movie
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHWrsTWR0xA&amp;t=165">02:45</a>  she actually for a second looked like NORMA DESMOND aka Gloria Swanson
Katrina did good in Tiger Zindagi hai . Patmavat only a hit cause of Sanjay Leela bansali and the male actors.
Anupama and rajeev interviewed ranveer and deepika for the success of padmaavat and not shahid kapoor. This is not good .Who else thinks this ??
I love Deepika Padukone! She&#39;s basically me, but taller, and prettier, and more successful!
Why don&#39;t these two Rajeev Masand and Anupama Chopra take joint interviews...both upload similar interviews...almost at the same time..shot at the same day😂...Kya audience ko do shows mein alag alag material milega Kya??not that much honestly..merge them
such a sweetheart😁
Deepika plz do a movie like &quot;ye jawani hai deewani&quot; loved it😘😘😘😘
It&#39;s like I am watching Rajeev&#39;s interview and then most of the questions asked are similar!
deepika s superstar and heroine no.1 of bollywood
i think Ranvir singh is her fuckboy toy, She would&#39;ve coupled well with Ranbir.
😍😍😍 👌👌👌
Deepika is so graceful and modest
Gluthathione which lightens skin tones actually also gives you that youthful luminous skin. So, if she is taking it then good for her.
She looks really pretty here.
Deepika Padukone ...You think a lot!,🤣
Dear all check all the architectural vedios  on my channel .Check them all and they are subjected to my channel copyright .Go ahead and run all of them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi2-dz-IeJY&amp;list=PLuWJVX977AoP_mEewYaijw2TbTdKlcXt-">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi2-dz-IeJY&amp;list=PLuWJVX977AoP_mEewYaijw2TbTdKlcXt-</a>
loved it. this interview is not a day old so its the most recent interview! so its telling me what&#39;s deepika doing now! I&#39;m fed up of viewing the same old interviews and  was waiting for a new one a d at last it came.. good! loveee deepika😘😘😍😍
and i dozed off for a few hours...now i know what to do when i can&#39;t sleep next time
I love Deepika......but interms of acting skills, Kangana is on next level. So she is number 1,
Ever so beautiful! love the make up :)
Best interview of DP till date
i love everything she said about social media and insta . woman i love you 💗💗💗
I love how she is so grounded in the most simplistic ways of life, like being so excited and happy about &quot;idly day&quot;! She is a film star yet she is not different from people like us, there is no air of arrogance, just simplicity! That&#39;s what I love about her so much. It&#39;s not necessary for people to be politically correct all the time! I mean come on! how many of us are? But we expect others to be only because they are popular? Why?! Just let them be and accept them the way they are☺️
Deepika is straight out of a Fair &amp; Lovely advert.
for the people who have problem with her accent.. what&#39;s the problem? she has a pretty decent <b>Indian</b> accent. when celebs like priyanka speaks in american accent u call them fake!!! n when deepika here is speaking in her natural tone..u call her boring. exactly what do people want??😑
love u deepu.., my sweetheart..😍😘😘
Oh, but why? In a year when Kangana has delivered performances like no other in Rangoon and Simran, we&#39;re still fixated on Deepika being number one! By what measure? B.O. numbers? And damn, she tries too hard to be a nice, decent, simple good girl/ daughter/ sister etc., atleast project that image.
That was so natural and charming. Really enjoyed that.
So graceful.
I thought Deepika was not available so Anupama got Diana Penty. But when she started speaking the same boring robotic gibberish I knew I was wrong
Too diplomatic yar.!!
omggggggggggggggg she needs to stop saying &#39;&#39;i think &#39;&#39; ...she doesnt realise she says its so much..its annoying ....she surely can  do without it... Deepika u are awesome..
beautiful smile
Very Boring same questions put on all the years..I feel bcz of same questions deepika giving boring answers. she is bored of same question s
A snoozefest...
She is very basic and organised while expressing herself....
She seems so chill and real, not putting   on a show. So refreshing.
She seems a sister from another mister , I also love idli chutney, cleaning my house and jst have a light life
Super boring interview with a super boring guest.
Who saw deepika advertisment before this video
So when are these interviewers gonna start asking Ranveer to comment on Deepika’s “weird” outfits? Her dressing lately....... 🙃
most of the time i think ,i think<br>so boring why to think so much and always give diplomatic and politically correct answers <br>Kangana&#39;s interviews are so real,informative ,intelligent and contented
I am dying to see you in a light-hearted/ romantic movie.
Stop with &quot;I think&quot;. Her PR team should tell her that.
She&#39;s aware of who she is and how she fits in to the scheme of things.  That may be a blend of having to deal with depression , which means having to overcome so much that many of us take for granted, combined with a natural need to understand and assimilate the world at a micro &amp; macro level.  She prefers order and symmetry, and hence works hard to do the right thing as much as possible.  She may not appear to be exciting , but maybe that&#39;s part of the balance of having to be in an industry where change is rapid and constant.  <br><br>I get that not everyone gets her vibe, but she&#39;s a beautiful and successful woman. And that&#39;s a fact.<br><br>A different interview experience, so thank you for sharing, Anupama.
Deepika, you’re plain boring !
She seems calm and composed even when shes dealing with all these stardom and fame ! Simply grounded <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23respect">#respect</a>✨♥️
I love you so much babe❤️❤️❤️
Who says Kangana can&#39;t speak English well Looks at her english
can hardly hear anything
Just look at the way she&#39;s blushing at the marriage rumour question😍😍😍😍
She is so pretty
I have a crush on her
विनीत सिंह को बुलाइए,<br>मुक्काबाज़ वाले<br>सविनय निवेदन मैडम जी,
Hi Film Companion, please enhance your audio volume. I always need to put on earphones to listen to your shows.
she needs to take out the word &#39;i think&#39;.. omg she says it so much it becomes irritating and hard to focus on the interview
So many people here watching an interview of someone they don&#39;t like. See the irony in that? All I&#39;m seeing is rubbish in the comments. Not the most powerful woman? Not No 1? Sit down, idiots. She&#39;s literally the most followed Asian woman on twitter, she&#39;s one of the highest paid actresses not just in India, but the world. She&#39;s loved by the masses and the classes. Since 2012, only Tamasha and Finding Fanny have flopped. She has a huge draw with the audience, despite being a woman in a man&#39;s world. For those saying she doesn&#39;t deserve credit for Padmaavat, open your eyes to the fact that that movie was marketed on her name and brand. The movie was named after her character, she was at the centre of all the promotional events, she fought and received higher pay than her male co stars, she was the one at the receiving end of death threats, she was the one from the cast who stood up for her film fearlessly. Ranveer may have won the audience with his performance, but it&#39;s Deepika who showed us through her actions the definition of a brave, powerful human. Y&#39;all can keep spreading negativity, while Deepika laughs all the way to the bank with her multi million dollar salary
Deepika has slept her way to the top......  <br><br>Karnataka politician nephew<br>Nihar Pandya<br>Yuvraj Singh<br>Ranbir Kapoor<br>Siddharth Mallaya <br>Ranveer Singh
deepika is awesome,,,but dam this interview is so boring and anupama i feel like smashing a pie on ur face ur so boring trying to act all english.
hi deepu sugamano meenamm
😘😘😘😘 She is sooo pretty!! I love her. A simple next door girl kind of girl
I have never feel sex on deep why because she s perfect woman am right
shes so dumb. this and her interview with ellen proves it.
This film padmaavat will change nothing about women in film industry because padmavati role was not that effective except in climax scene. It was mostly all about Khilji obsession and Ranveer than her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23facts">#facts</a> massive success for his portrayal . Deepika was special apperance and acted badly.
She seems to have patched up with Karni Sena  and their masters.... what a Faustian cop out !!!
If someone find her boring or just hate her becoz of any reason (jealousy) then pls dont watch videos related to her
This interview is so beautiful! It touches such beautiful points! She&#39;s so grounded. More power to her!
Sorry for putting my link<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSTSN_OoLSA">https://youtu.be/KSTSN_OoLSA</a>
she the no 1 <br>..movies like cocktail, piku, bajirao, finding fanny are treasure but bajirao is bestest than padmavat according to her acting
ohhhh dis is awwwwwfully boring man...  juz can&#39;t bear wid dez over the top buttery cheezy sugar coating conversationz... 5 mins into it n am done..
She blinks a lot
A Good Friendly Chat! This was Light and Fun!
D numbers of &quot;I think&quot; in her statements is annoying...its fit into each sentence
Neend aa gyi...
Nice!!
Fc at least Deepika could have change the costume....just to make us feel that this is new interview after Rajeev Masand interview and this is not the first time.....Ranveer&#39;s  interview had the same issue....plz take some efforts.....I love Fc hence suggested...😊
Meaningless interview. Seems like these superstars are almost like slaves to their own PR team.
Can anyone read her ankle tatoo ?
She is such a down to earth simple lady... I love her
The position she has achieved is because of the opportunities she got and also her hardwork. But she did mainstream cinema. And thus she is likely to reach there. Look at jacqueline, is she an actor, no! Actresses who are really powerful in terms of creative control are Vidya, Kangana, Priyanka and Anushka.
Its not just the way she expresses it, her ideas itself are too damn boring. She has a personality of a robot 😏..and the acting, is just a single dimensional performance.. i came here to see if anything has changed about her. But no,she is her old &quot;sweet&quot; self..!
She is indeed the most powerful women in Bollywood ♥️ Love her so much
same boring
Thanks Anupama for this interview with Deepika..we get to know how she is..What she does in everyday life..makes us feel good about our mundane routine..she is so down to earth..Thanks for that
Not everybody is same when it comes to public speaking. I don’t understand why people are comparing her with Kangana or Vidya. She has her own personality. What if she is not spontaneous, she is an actress and she is doing her work very well. The way she has improved her performance and the way she has achieved that success is very commendable. We have no right to judge her by the way of her speaking in an interview. If you are not her fan don’t watch it, as simple as that..
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHWrsTWR0xA&amp;t=1382">23:02</a> Known for not mincing word..... I died laughing
She looks happy and you can just see it shine all over her face. Touchwood 💗 Glad Ranveer turned out to be the man to put her broken heart back and make her so happy again. Betrayals can otherwise turn you into a miserable and low esteem person all your life.
I so relate to the cleaning and organising bit.. its so therapeutic!
Indian Monica Geller- Deepika Padukone
Would be happy if she will ditch jerk ranveer soon 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHWrsTWR0xA&amp;t=1004">16:44</a> hats off for that......
Do second part of yeh jawani hai deewani with one n only ranbir kapoor great charming couple
Arrey, &quot;do you see yourself as an artist or a brand?&quot; I mean obviously anybody...even Sunny Leone would say that she sees herself as an artist. What are these questions Anupama. Would u say no to certain roles? What would u expect her to respond. This total flattery...&quot;ur no.1/I mean no. 1....&quot;
At least she should change clothes from the interview she gave the same day to Rajeev Masand :)
Great interview Anupama.she seems to be comfortable with u.
Happiness is watching deepika again and again😍😍
Love her.
Stop calling her boring that’s how she is she can’t change herself
Oh, my goodness she&#39;s looking so pretty😍.  I was just looking at her the whole time instead listening to what she was saying
Am I the only one who can see deepika blushing throughout the interview
Anu , not again ! Just when we think film companion is doing a fabulous job you bring these models . We want you to talk to actors ,talk about their craft. Not this type. Can you even imagine asking her about the thought process that went behind a particular scene ? All she does is blink blink , repeat the same answers which you can count on your fingers - ocd , anxiety , ranbir, ranveer . She&#39;s a gorgeous lady but the truth is overrated as an actress. If you people continue promoting such ppl, when will the actors get a chance? And pls don&#39;t say she&#39;s a shy person or an introvert type. It&#39;s a universally accepted theory that introverts make the best actors
She said some really amazing things about the importance of normalcy in life z family, home. Love her opinion on Time&#39;s Up. She thinks before she speaks and that&#39;s how it should be rather than blurting out nonsense. Great interview!
Glad someone in the industry understands Time&#39;s Up should be gender neutral.
Plz do an interview with kartik aryan. I think it wud be fun to see asking u questions to him about the female bashing films that he has done.
She was a model, n dreamed of being in showbiz, n yet shy on camera
man o man shes boring af... thats didnt change
Do Anupama and Rajeev Masand share the same office? 😂
Is it me or the volume of the voice on this video is very low??
I respect this woman so much. And i don&#39;t get why she always gets hate. She&#39;s a calm person who is soft-spoken and well behaved. There&#39;s no rule that you have to be loud in interviews always. There&#39;s enough controversies anyways. She used to play sports so she is relaxed and composed, which is hard when you&#39;re frequently asked diplomatic or personal questions (which you necessarily don&#39;t want to answer.) <br>Besides, she is talented and focused on her work and I admire her for being so down to earth &amp; genuine. It&#39;s upsetting that she is called boring just because she is not being witty.
Why so low volume
I don&#39;t get y they r making this movie a woman centric movie?? The only reason I saw Padmaavat is bcoz of Ranveer, he stole d show! But she is taking all d credit here.
How do even people like her.......she is dumb as hell... we get it she is shy but she doesn&#39;t know how to answer the question..
I could listen to her talk forever. Thank you Anu for asking great and diverse questions. I especially appreciate the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23timesup">#TimesUp</a> question and her answer floored me! What a woman!!
This was one of the most boring interviews.  Nothing new. She sounds scripted. She isn&#39;t but she sounds it. That&#39;s the bad thing.
😍😍😍most beautiful heroin😇😇😇
Ranbeer kapoor
She is very proudy and it&#39;s not from. 💓 she is using brain she can&#39;t, be like kangana she is quite mature regarding her business and relationship but nothing else
She&#39;s a good actress but pls don&#39;t relate acting to power. Powerful woman of d industry really??? 🤦‍♀️ Padmavat was really not her best. N I hope she experiments more with her roles.
Anupama you are wearing fizzy goblet. Finally !!!!
That was lovely Anupama, but can we have a nice breezy chat with Aishwarya, it&#39;s been a while. It&#39;s seems you two have made a pact unless it&#39;s Cannes we won&#39;t talk. <br>Please bring her back.
Just wasted my half an hour by watching this bad interview. She hasn&#39;t say anything. And anupama asked such boring questions. Which r valueless 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Boring question and boring answers. Anupama chopra try some good fun questions.
Deepika has only one day for interviews..after Rajeev she came to anupama with the same get up..😂
So boring interview 😟
Atleast ranveers dressing sense is more fun thn deepikas....hers is jus boring and bad
Was the interview just about  Deepika cleaning her house
Deepika is no doubt very beautiful and I commend her for speaking about mental health etc. However,  there is no depth to her in any of her interviews. It&#39;s like she has a script that she reads from and anyone can see that she is not being herself. She has a platform to speak about relevant subjects but all we here is her robotic, boring and super diplomatic answers. Couldn&#39;t help skip for most of the interview because it is soo boring! Her acting is not that great too. She was in good movies like Piku but the film was not successful because of her but it was more due to GREAT WRITING (SCRIPT).With padmavat Ranveer Singh was the one that really captured and engaged the audience with the story. Jim Sarbh was outstanding too. I think Deepika and Aishwarya are quite similar in that they are both very beautiful, boring and not that great of an actor.
i think so deepika and ranveer should do a play together instead of a rom com movie...trust me it will go super duper hit!!!
People who are criticizing her should remember it&#39;s her simplicity! She&#39;s not a lawyer who can make 10 different meanings of a single question. She&#39;s modest and honest in her Interviews and she never says something that hurts anyone&#39;s sentiments. It&#39;s interview not an argument. People who criticize her should get a life better than her and then comment with valid reasons. She&#39;s unique and loved by all. No one can deny the fact that she&#39;s the best ❤️
I don&#39;t understand why people hate her being &quot;politically correct&quot;? She&#39;s picking her words wisely, making sure not to accidently or intentionally hurt anyone and yet still delivering her own opinion loud and clear. She knows that words can hurt and she doesn&#39;t want to hurt. What&#39;s bad about that?
❤️
Why is the first answer so boring
Most powerful woman in Bollywood? My foot! <br>How can u forget Kangana?
I think deepika dodged the question at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHWrsTWR0xA&amp;t=1116">18:36</a> about being busy with wedding shopping lol tsk tsk anupama you gotta be more clever than that
If u ask me who interviewed Deepika better , I&#39;ll go with Anupama
Deepika&#39;s INTERVIEW answers consists of 80% &quot;I THINK&quot;.
Like deepika mentioned she wants to do fun n light movies..I would love to watch her in a karan johar movie
You have the most irritating laugh, Anupama. And you are the most boring interviewee, Deepika. Do tell us more about ur cupboard n ur south indian breakfasts. So frikkin boring
I don&#39;t know how you are called as an actor. To me I never feel you act well. Your acting is not even in average mark to me.
I LOVE HER MORE NOW UGH thanks Anupama love your interviews tbh!!!
Gave up after 1 min
OMG, again padmavat discussion.
My favorite
I have started liking her. Idk why :D
I really love the comfortable casual look deepika is flaunting here. To me this kinda simple look is way classier n way beautiful than those shiny glimmery looks
23 : 33 Minutes, And I just looking at her. how can someone look so beautiful?? How? How? I&#39;m not tired looking at her..
Love her! So much better than her yesterday&#39;s interview with Rajeev. :D
She is a wonderful person and beauty with brains. Love her.Such an inspiration she is. ❤❤❤
Hit like if you were thinking about the cute Deepveer Kids when Deepika talked about wanting to be a working mom. xD
all she says i think
Beautiful girl. But not very smart or lacks imagination. Her thought process is very limited... just like her acting range.
Lovebyou baby
loveeeeeee youuuuuuu deeeeepika dhiiiiiiii 😍😍😍❤❤❤😙😙😙😙😙😙
She is so boring and come across as such hypocrite that its painful to watch her interviews.
At one point she says she is nt addicted to Instagram and then she is like watching Netflix ... why do actors deny using social networks like why do they hire their teams for then ... plz speak truth ... their is no shame in following the trend they don’t even last longer ...
OMG! so pretty and full of innocence.......sure a SURE STAR......already planning for a adorable and cute family of twins!!
Drinking challenge : drink a peg of harpic Every time she says &quot;I think&quot;
Her whole brain is scripted. Can&#39;t speak one word from her heart  👎
Deepika padukone great deepika padukone mother of acting lv you deepika padukone
Some of you are telling Deepika that she is too boring and should be more controversial, meanwhile half the actresses in Bollywood need to be taking Hindi and acting lessons.
Ppl online has been bullies. They hide behind fake names and talk like brave ppl.<br>Give your views but don’t spread hatred we have live in so much of nonsense in our day to day life.
She did NOT bleach her skin. There are paparazzi pictures of her 2 days ago, in normal lighting where she has a dark complexion. And in strong studio lighting it’s lighter. It’s normal, SHUT THE FUCK UP
After her first coffee with Karan sensational interview she&#39;s decided to keep everything sedated..I do love her though...but taking out Padmavat and the Jauhar scene..yikes
she&#39;s so lovely
I really love her :D :D
miss goody two shoes at it again with her robotic answers. i guess its a common capricorn trait. her, hritik, tiger woods, etc..just want to keep this good &quot;image&quot; when even they dont realize their dirty deeds are even more apparent in doing so. ppl can see thru the fakeness. id much rather my lioness of a lady kangana. she fears no one, speaks straight from heart yet is very intelligent using her mind.
the most talented and beautiful indian actress of all time
she is perfect
Boring interview
Lady ur a top heroine now... atleast now talk genuinely and openly like others actors like Kangana,Vidya nd all...
Cocktail onwards DP has really added more depth to all her characters, than probably required on paper.<br><br>Veronicas character is smthg she carried so well.. effortlessly. it was a movie where she was not the female lead in the second half, probably the only instance in her bollywood filmography.. <br><br>Also her character was so well portrayed that all other characters seemed cardboard cut-outs. ( even Randeep Hooda added that depth beyond the script probably).<br><br>Veronica as the self destructive outgoing but rather lonesome lass was one of the most memorable characters in the past 7years.<br><br>kudos DP on the success of Padmaavat despite all the turbulent weather it had to get past.
I feel so amused for all those who are saying she gives boring interviews and is politically correct &amp; blah blah blah 😂😂😂. If she&#39;s boring and simple then tum log iss kaabil kyu nahi ban jaate ki log tumhaara bhi interview lein aur tumhaari thoughts jaan na chaahe? You guys just hate yourself that you guys are living an anonymous life and are not worthy enough to get interviewed by anyone! Today what Deepika has achieved and what position she holds, you&#39;ll not be able to be at par with that even in your 7 lives, so just chill and use burnol. And yes, burnol pain toh ease kar dega but jealousy will keep slowly killing you 😏
It’s upsetting to see Anupama calling Deepika no 1 so many times almost literally shoving it down our throat , when someone with even a little knowledge of Bollywood, would know for fact that there is no number one actress today . Even if there is Deepika clearly shares the spot with kangana and many more.
Delightful interview. Deepika you&#39;re such a joy! Fingers crossed for fun and light arriving on our screens very soon.
Respect from canada
She seems so happy and content now, compared to how she was in 2013-2014. She had massive and continuous hits in that year and yet she was never this cheerful or happy. I am so glad Deepika is finally herself now and I hope she and Ranveer have a great life together. &lt;3 &lt;3<br>Deepika, Priyanka, Ranveer Singh and Alia are just a delight to watch, such happy, content and warm people
seems like netflix is big thing in bollywood lol
Snooze!!!! Politically correct all the time.
Extreme bleaching!
She looked very different in the beginning of her career. Now she has become so so beautiful i can&#39;t even describe how perfect she looks. Her makeup artist should be awarded. 😭😭
why are all Anupama&#39;s and Rajeev&#39;s interviews the same ??? Same questions and same topic !!!
Oh wow she looks adorable , so good to see this interview she is glowing I love to watch her movies padmavat film is soo amazing all the best deepika for ur future
Ma&#39;am can you do something like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askbr">#askBR</a> kind of session it&#39;ll be a great learning and exposure to the movies.??
She&#39;s so inspiring ! Love this interview 😍😍
So she is boring because she doesn&#39;t have the energy and quirk of Kajol or Kareena !! Get over yourselves guys; every individuals are different. Deepika is top in her own trade, she is pretty intelligent, and comes up with thoughtful and analytical answers, which is the very purpose of an interview. Merely acting bindaas- is NOT.
i think this is deepika&#39;s best interview yet...she comes across as a genuine girl.successful yet balanced.anupama does know how to draw out her guests.
She is stunningly pretty !!
Apart if she would display her light dark skin more often it would be a great help for people who suffers from complex as of their skin tone leading to poor self esteem n deep lying inferiority.<br>Literally she is the best eg of the fact beauty is not skin tone deep.her display of her original shade will be great confidence booster for many Indian girls.
Why do people have problem with Ranveer&#39;s unique outfits? On the other hand female celebs like Sonam et all are praised for being &#39;fashionistas&#39;. Double Standards much? Ranveer is the only male celeb who dresses interesting please let him be.
This talk is full of I,Me and Myself still with a ironic undertone that I don&#39;t take me n myself seriously.
I love Deepika P&#39; but Padmavat wasn&#39;t a kind of cinema I would be comfortable watching to. It was just too problematic!!
Ha ha she is now almost as white as Anu.
She is looking radiant 🌼🌷🌼
With all due respect no film worked bcoz of her be it piku or padmavati or etc. Its all bcoz of solid writing direction plus good acting but dont start a pointless debate of how big u became. To me Tabu and Vidya Balan carriea film on their shoulders. Dirty Picture was more of vidya film rather than of naseer saab or emraan.
DEEEEEPIIIKKKKKAAAAA❤️👑 of Btown 🖤
She is so so cute n beautiful..phat phat hehe.. n she hs definitely empowered oder ppl who underwent depression..like me..love you Deepika :)
Deepu, just keep smiling all the worlds problems will be solved <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23love">#Love</a>
Love Dippi! ❤️
How does her complexion become soo light?
She&#39;s soooooooooooooooooo beautiful... Every time
Here comes I think and I feel actor  yawnnnn, her interview is soooo boring and always same. Doesn&#39;t feel genuine and nthg like how kangana engages n enlightens . Plus she needs to learn acting and not just make big eyes n  teary eyes ...that&#39;s not all acting. She is only brand lol not actor
Y’all here talking about how boring she is, I’m here being inspired.😌
She looks like a sweetheart . She minds her business and do her job . Where is the hate coming from ???<br>You guys running to watch 24 min of someone you hate ?? 🤔🤔🤔🤔<br><br>Queen of Bollyhood indeed
Make a sequel to ye jawaani
how diplomatic you have to be .... My god constantly being vigilant about you say beating round the bush on every question not revealing anything .. giggling anchor trying so desperately not to throw any direct questions but constantly needling her to reveal her personal life.. gosh being perfect every sec .. GYM.. JUICE..NARRATION.. GYM .. MASSAGE .. DODGING OOGLING EYES OF PUBLIC, PAPPARAZZI every sec .. EK Idli Dosa khane k baad GYM bhagna padta .. tough life .. ek din koi aur heroine public ko pasand aane lagegi .. buisnessman se shaadi aur fir zindagi bhar looking back at your golden days..MAI TO CHALA CHOLE BHATURE KHANE..
Her personality is such a turn off.
FUCK.. ! her eyes are so horribly BIG ! .. she looks like a disney cartoon.. !
Can FC please do an interview with Zoya Akhtar.
Queen of hearts
How Did she became so fair
As expected she is boring ,diplomatic made us all yawned and ultimately sleep ... She never carried any film on her shoulder always big production , big star cast and khans .. Even in padmavat she was just jewelry show piece ...
Yawn
She  has improved and looks better . Sorry to say she is not no 1
Both interviews r exactly same.. I follow Rajeev Masand n Anumpa channel, n questions r all same. Disappointed.
Such a lovely interview.
I really loved Deepika,  she had good acting skill , she looks beautiful but i really don&#39;t like her in Padmavat. As a fan i really don&#39;t want her to do any other future project with Bhansali , He just repeated same acting skill of her again n again. I can&#39;t differentiate BTW Padmavat n BM.
She thinks!!! Lol
One name... D E E P I K A<br>One word... P E R F E C T I O N
Is the presenter stupid. Deepika is not the powerful person in the industry . Deepika still has alot to prove .
I also want to see her in lite role
She is definitely getting married this year.
What did she say about Ranveer pls??!!
Deepika lying here also like she did with just with Rajeev.
She is so beautiful. 😘
🌷💗
Sofa !!!
God, now I have an urge to watch yeh jawani hai deeaani. It&#39;s 1 am already, I am so screwed for college tomorrow.
her radiant skin is brighter than my future.
Deepika&#39;s complexion seems lighter than before. I hope she&#39;s not messing with her skin tone ; it was beautiful as it was.
I think! Then blink blink!  again i think i think and blink! then lets all go to sleep! <br>Lol! Jus kiddin!<br>She is very beautiful and has evolved a lot as an actor but when it comes to interviews, she is extremely boring by trying to be politically correct always! There is no depth and intellect! Better all other actors from bollywood take lessons from Sharukh khan and Kangana Ranaut on how to give badass interviews &amp; to blow viewers mind with their intellect, depth and wit! On point always!
She is so fakkkkkkke.......one fake smile everywhere movie interview ads..... robot....no sense of role she picks...only big banner and money should be there
I&#39;m so smitten by her.<br>I wanna bury my pecker so deep in her pink canoe that if someone were to pull it out, would be named King Arthur.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23iwish">#Iwish</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ireallydo">#IReallyDo</a>
This interview is far more interesting than Rajeev&#39;s one. His questions were plain boring.
Padmavat was all ranveer singh. Deepika was like almost a side character.. jim sarbh, sahid, and other few characters were more interesting  than hers.. and for some reason i feel like deepika is doing same stuff for last few years but i guess anupama loves her so much cant help but praise her..
You are real feminist ma&#39;am. Talking abt women empowerment and also gender equality.
I think I think I think I think...I think I think I think...Cut the crap
Such a lovely conversation ya ❤
I want to see Hrithik &amp; Deepika together in a film <br>I hope they will have awsm chemistry
She is just so wonderful. Thank you for this!
She should join politics... She is politically correct may be even while she sleeps
Same celebrities, same topics , same questions, same interview. Just watched Rajeev Masand interview with Deepika and now Anupama Chopra interview Deepika. Why can&#39;t Anupama and Rajeev do this together like they do it in Mami. Interview and movie reviews together. Will save a lot of time
So pretty, so DUMB
It is a great responsibility to be the nation&#39;s no.1 actress ! Haters...U don&#39;t like her ,that&#39;s  ur opinion !! But remember u have never been in her shoes !<br>LotsOfLoveForYou ❤❤
I don&#39;t know why ppl like staying the same..&quot;like the way I&#39;ve been brought up&quot; she said this like million times.. does change means bad thing or you&#39;re so dwelled in your own pathetic pattern of living that you dont get evolved at all..!
Has anyone ever met her and is she polite and nice in person?
deepika the most beautiful face I ever seen 😚😚😚❤❤
Love you and Ranveer very much
QUEEEEEN DEEPIKA
QUEEN 😍😍😘😘
My 2 favs in a single frame 😘😘
Long awaiting interview. Thanks, Deepika Padukone and Anupama. Great energy and love to both of you.
ohhh, this wasn&#39;t expected on a Thursday night, super excited to watch it (y)
Rajeev just released his interview- Sucharita will you be releasing the next one now?
Ranveer fan must like 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
