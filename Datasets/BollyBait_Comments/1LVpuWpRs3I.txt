Dulha isi ke jaisa thaa kya jo rone lage enjoy karna thaa
This song is supposed to be a happy song, but there is no joy or merry feeling in her singing. No offence intended.
Ye song to accha he hi but Phillauri movie bhi underrated masterpiece he!!
When I was small that time I used to hear this song from that time I didn&#39;t get to hear  this  song , until I  became  a  teenager  now  I  hear  this song  I  always  become  very  happy 😊
Anyone in 2024 😂

So a close friend of mine (yes he was more than my friend -,-) recommended this song to me and it became my favorite song. I had listen this song before he recommended it to me but his recommendation was special. I used to dream of making a bridal entry with this song at our weeding😶‍🌫. But the twist is that we have lost communication. IRONY. So every time I come back here, it brings back all of his memories. Anyway, I will still play this song at my wedding.<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/vQF1XpyaG_XG8gTs77bACQ"></a>

jasleen royals voice is pure bliss
Movie name
This song is an amazing compostion... When the song plays at a wedding party on those big speakers, when the bass hits.. oh god.. it sends chills down the spines.. and equally beautifully sung. People make fun saying this should not be played because it has been played so many times and has become a cliche.. but the fact is.. this song has that vibes and thats why it has become the anthem!

Meri gf kii shadi ho rahi thi aisa hi gaana bajj raha tha DJ pe aur me tent ke pishe shup ke ro raha tha, woh feeling nhi smjh skta koyi.
List of songs like this one, let&#39;s start commenting
Dude my parents start crying everytime they listen to this thinking I’ll get married some day✨<br>Edit- my father passed away this year so I am never getting married, I can’t without him, he would say how he would have a breakdown if they played this on my wedding and now he is gone. Love your parents.<br>Our indian families are not very verbally expressive, its more about acts of service and actions they do but please start saying things like “i love you” and “appreciate you” to your parents because you will be saying this once they are gone. ❤️
Dude,when my sister going to marry I  just cried so much , infact I can&#39;t able to handle my self but at the end I have to do Last rasam..........and this song played ........omg that day.......I can&#39;t forget our legend
<b>OMG, WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH THIS AWESOME MUSIC?</b><br><b>I LOOK IT BEEN TOP 1 TRENDING WHEN PUBLISHING</b>

one of the feb. song of mine
आदरणीय पूनम दी,<br>जोहार,<br>नए रास्ते पर आगे बढ़ने की बहुत सारी बधाइयां।<br>कहते हैं बड़ी बिटिया घर की मुस्कान होती है। बड़ी बिटिया विदा नहीं होती, माता-पिता को टुकड़ों में काट कर ले जाती है। व्यस्तता रही, आ नहीं सकें। <br>लेकिन, आपके लिए प्रार्थना की है मैंने। आपके आंखों में नमी, होंठों पर सम्मान और आंचल में सावन बरसे। <br>महादेव आपको संतोष दें, सम्मान दें और आपके हाथ में सिमटे उन हिस्सों को भावनात्मक रूप से सींचते रहें, जो आपके साथ विदा हो गया है।<br>आपका<br>अभिषेक

If DIN Shahana and London thumakada is not played on my wedding day i won&#39;t marry 😹
I really love song
Listen again and again never fill heart
First🥺
Just a few weeks prior was my sister&#39;s shaadi :) words cannot describe how i felt when my appie walked down the path with this song playing and me holding her dress. When the song came to the part where the beat gets faster, i started crying so so much. The same appie who have always been like a second mother to me, raised me, took care of me, played all sorts of games, like cricket together with my other siblings. That same appie who still seemed so young to me, was now walking down the path about to be together with her husband for her entire lifetime. I cried so much its unbelievable. Now im sure they were happy tears. Appie, if youre somehow reading this, i love you so much.  Im so proud of you.<br><br>And to everyone else who&#39;s read this comment all the way too the bottom, please enjoy time with your siblings. Cousins. Family. Even friends. :) You never know, one day you&#39;ll be playing with your little daughter, next thing you know there she is sitting on the sofa with her husband hand-in-hand in front of the banquet. ❤❤❤❤❤ its truly an amazing and remarkable feeling. Alhamdulilah i got to feel it ❤ Stay safe and stay happy everyone &lt;3333
