Why ladies getting money when both proceed as equals ?
Its a myth that women need care love affection as a number one priority.. In fact its the men who crave for love care affection . Women want security as their number one priority emotional, social financial security. Men tend to stray when they dont get unconditional love care  respect ,and then they pay a heavy price in form of alimony . Its a wake up call for women who dont know how to tackle their man so that he surrenders to them by will,not by force. Dont expect physical loyalty from your man. Treat it as a bonus . Just give him unconditional love care attention and  see the magic.The man will live and die for the safety security and well bieng of his wife throughout his life . And women please listen if your man is handsome and successful  please expect that other ladies will keep falling for him. If u want to see the rainbow you will have to tolerate the rain. Dont get possessive . Treat him like a king and he will always be yours.

The narrator needs to learn proper English
One interesting is for sure all the first wife‚Äôs who got divorced and havent found any partner yet like Reena, Payal, Amrita etc. have put on a lot of weight and clearly shows how unhappy they must be  to be used and thrown after their partners found another woman. Sad thing and only thing to flash is how much money they got instead of the trauma they went for being dumped for another woman.<br>It‚Äôs Not Always About Alimony for a Woman for sure.

Men have to fit in the society chain to make money, leaches just have to find a host
A man&#39;s loyalty is tested when he is rich and 99% fail.
Looks like bollywood has no morals. Marriage is a joke to them.

Gaury khan. Why did you get so angry with Shahrukh ? Just he kiss to<br>Priyanka ? Oh no. this is not a love kiss. And that&#39;s why you got divorce<br><br>form him ?  I would know when he is kissing for love or not. You make <br>a mistake. That&#39;s what I want to tell you. Thank you
Why only men have to pay alimony in divorce why not women too?<br>This world is soo selfish, favour for female only.<br>Why don&#39;t male demand dowry from women family then? It&#39;s not wrong too<br>If I would in power I will definitely put women to their aukaat because those properties are not her sweat money.

Stupid why do u add srk fmily
Sussane hit lottery. She was his childhood friend and marrying her cost him the most. What a friendship. Thus never marry a childhood friend ü§£
Why have you put Sharukh Khan‚Äôs family up. They are happily married and they are so involved with their three kids.
These are wives or gold diggers. What a shame
See me Please
Why is Shah Rukh Khan and his wife&#39;s picture here? Aren&#39;t you doing them a big injustice by planting news regarding them in your video? They are still together and are a happy family of five
Wait what ? How Divorce can be expensive ?
Actresses are nothing but they are gold diggers. Except their good looking faces and bodies to show to the masses through their films. Never marry an actress ever
Why did you put SRK&#39;s picture??? üëé
Alimony.......where is the gender equality......
They have money that why they give
Our confused Indian cousins. Thank God we have our Pakistan.
Love it.  That&#39;s why the Celebrity Pu$$ys are  expensive.  Havenot gets money from haves that&#39;s how it works. If you are poor and married divorce will not cost  a single paisa. DESPITE OF PAYING HEFTY FINE STILL THESE SUCKERS GO FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF PU$$Y. DID THEY LEARN A LESSON . NO, NEVER. ALL DIVORCES ARE INTERESTING BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW THESE WOMEN ARE SKILLFUL IN SQUEEZING MAN&#39;S  WALLET. AND I AM PROUD OF THESE WOMEN.
Don&#39;t use srk pic for divorce üò°üò°
What type of dog shit life these celebs live in... Only money!
What the hell? Shahrukh Khan is not divorced.
Conclusion: Divorced lady ends up with crores &amp; buys a bungalow !
Saif being crorepathi  paid only 5 crores for amritha,  but showering  money on his second wife kareena,  Taimur&#39;s nanny gets 2lakhs per month salary,  now with the second child,  one more nanny also gets the same.
WTF ! Rule is this ! Why only men should pay for a women while getting divorced ? if the fault is on wife side like extra marital affair or something ! if the husband like to leave that woman on her own choice by divorcing her he want pay for that also ! It will make a men angry to the core ! then he will just pay few bucks to a murderer to murder his so called wife or x wife ü§î if it happens does the law will accept it ! Easily women can become a millionare without effort and hardwork by divorcing again and again ! law should be re anlaysed its completely a cringe stuff üò¨
Why the f* did you put SRK pic are you enjoying in Divorces you are such a shit
I love you my Indian culture I am sending to Dubai

Why were Shahrukh Khan and Gauri Khan on the cover of this video ?
When Men And Women are equal then why court goes with Women in term of Money
Your video is misleading. How can you deceive your viewers with false picture s. One of the most successful marriage is that of shahrukh n gauri.
Why did you show SRK,s photo? You should be ashamed of your cheap gimmicks ü§®
So marriage is business now.....wow
Cheapest alimony was of saif Ali Khan! Even ordinary people pay that amount! He is really a miser !
These god gifted bollywood actress may have chance to marry again and again to become richest in bollywood family

DiE-Worse *only for money .....
Hrittik roshon &amp; suzan
Don&#39;t Divorce ... Love Heart life ....Wast money ....Save Children ....Family Nature ..
You have it wrong.   There was no alimony  involved in Hrithik and Sussanne  divorce.   They separated very amicably and share custode of their two sons.
Hritik is the best bollywood will ever have.......He is unmatchable
DIVORCE MADE ON MUTUAL CONSENT OR ON CONTESTED COURT CASES. EXPLAINED REASONABLY.
Hrithik is so smart and suzeen is so insont
You as the old saying goes, be careful who you marry, or otherwise it will be a fenarul
The voice of her is wierd it&#39;s okk
Hhh these gold diggers
Are u mad??üò°üò†<br>Why u put SHAHRUKHAN picture? üò†üò†<br>I was shocked to see shahrukhan picüò±üò±

The men got married twice , thrice it means may be the men only used their wives<br><br>I highly appreciate Malaika Arora , she gets her life even better after divorce ‚ù§Ô∏è Every divorced women should do so..
You stupid ppl. SRK and Gauri are happy together. Why on earth are you ppl doing this. Stop this unwanted gossip content about celebrities. They are also humans, they also have feelings. Don&#39;t take pleasure in their pain.
Very sad

Why all the Rheas are so geedy<br>Edit:- greedy
Ladies interested  divorce on account of alimony
All of them were supe duper expensive and wastage of money, for trifling causes
They all are cheep
dont put red mark to ladies. There are no genuine gents in the world. After 11 and above years of marriage  one lady wants diverce with her husband means how much she strugled. Dont blame ladies because all gents are not fair
Money flowing like water falls on ex wives, this is bollywood, ü§≠ü§≠
Why are you spoiling name of Shahrukh Khan

Shahrukh khan is not divorced lol
Among them all Malaika. Arora should not get that amount because she is the one broke her marriage because of the dildo of the Arjun kapor, that&#39;s what I felt.
The bollywood celebrties always  divorce   not the hollywod not the south indian didn,t  do any divorce because , they marriage at a perfect age and perfect person
saif wife  amrita didnt ask  too much money   even though saif was rich ,  hats off to   independent women  amrita .
Hrithik will re marry Suzanne
Hrithik and Suzanne
Rhea Pillai is veryyyyyy cheap lady
Adhuna akhter Bhabani is a very very very cheap lady
Amrita Singh is a cheap lady
This rhea is such a gold digger. Marrying rich personalities like Sanjay Dutt and Leander &amp; divorcing them for money.<br>Such characterless shameless woman.<br>Moreover she is so crappy looking. Gosh what did Sanju &amp; Leander saw in this ugly girl
Can&#39;t stand the voice.... Every word is broken down into 3-4 syllables... Couldn&#39;t get past a min or so..
Rittik and suzane
Why you show Shahrukh on expensive divorce ? This reduces credibility of your website.
Gold diggers are everywhere, but men don‚Äôt seem to learn lesson
15 crore is still expensive but not soo expensive but still not too much
Hrithik roshan can afford to do that he‚Äôs rich enough for being able to afford that. But that still is a waste of money to pay 400 crores
Only this much. Useless fellows. Our family  100 Cr giving. These peoplemiddle class<br>Compare to mining owner.
Hahahaha..
OMG 350 CRORES MATTERS A LOT..
Why did you put the pic of Sharukh khan
Please don&#39;t marry to someone who can&#39;t keep their relationship forever .
Instead of using those money for divorce they should have donated the money for poor and desperate people.
I don&#39;t like divorce, adultery and abortion.
That&#39;s too much why don&#39;t they work for Poor&#39;s in India! If they have lot&#39;s of money!
We want justice for SSR rest of all are bitches
They married these celebrities  only for money and fame  not love.
sanju and manyata are in happy marriage life
is this women  mad badsha and gouri are in happy marriage life
This lady&#39;s will be rich if they got married again and again. They become rich without working.
Isn&#39;t it malaika fault for cheating on arbaaz them why should arbaaz give her the alimony???this is very unfair
Atrocious English..structure and pronunciation both..

Bollywood is Darkest,  this Bollywood people‚Äôs for this money doing  this disgusting   Like   Rhea Chakraborty,  culprit cheated for this money  only Sushant ji,

Porque las mujeres exigen pago, ni que fuera un trabajo que horror, porque no le pagan a los hombres tambi√©n.
Susanne demanded huge amount....she was linked with Arjun Rampal  n blamed Hrithik , Hrx is a humble guy....
Rhea Pillai was a gold digger
Marriage is not a game...... All people should think twice before married...... Ciz marriage is a secret ceremony......
This is the best way to earn extra money in tons easily n also take money fr the kids so life is set diborce just an excuse
Hrithik Roshan is really rich.

These alimony belongs to audience mind it
pagal hain kiya srk ki pic q dali üò†
Malaika is a selfish,playgirl actress
Some marry for alimony i think  - this is not fair - like that reah pillai  both are equally responsible for divorce  -so why should a man pay for her  yes if children are there man should pay for the children&#39;s education  see that Suzanne khan - how many crores of rupees she took  shame upon these kind of people - these women never think about the feeling of their children
You mad fool.<br>Crores and crores of money!!<br>Stupid news!
Rithik and sussan!!
No divorce can ever be interesting or wanted ü•µüò°üëπ

De verdad est√°is locos !!!!!<br>Por qu√© la foto de Shah Rukh y Gouri ?????<br>S√≥lo para entrar y leer la gente ??!??!
I have yet to hear from someone who never took a cent from her ex.
SRK is not!
I know one of my classmates got divorced thrice and received handsome amount. It is not obious that husband is the main reason for divorce or guilty party. So why should men cover future cost of women.<br>Now she migrated to Australia and living lavish life over there.
SRK family are blessed family. Never put the picture of them.

For Hrithik, that amount is the drop in a bucket. He will get that in 1 year. <br>I suspect he cheated on her.  She found out. Other than that I don&#39;t see any reason for separation.
Why SRK and GOURI????  Gone mad? Videos are business for you people, whether be it true or false.

Dowry is a crime.... Alimony is a right .... even in cases where there are no children, even if wife is more richer financially, better educated and better earnings.
this is really exasperating! u just use SRK &amp; Gauri&#39;s pic on thumbnail to get a view?
Change your thumbnail that mention SRK &amp; Gauri which is misleading as per title
Abe kutte chinal ke isme srk Ka photo kyon hi.tere baap Ka photo rakhle.most cheap video in you tube
Only suzzainnnnnn
When are rich self made business men, male actors and men who have worked hard to earn their money going to learn they cannot get married in this era. The women of today will clean you out, the only money a woman should get is child support but they should not in anyway claim divorce alimony for themselves. The women should leave the marriage with what they entered the marriage with or if they had a business together with their husband then they should divide the profit evenly. I don&#39;t understand why men and women have to get married just enjoy your love until it fizzles out. The other thing is don&#39;t live together because the women can claim common law wife status, the men in this clip I don&#39;t feel sorry for because they should know better. The World is full of gold diggers and they will get what they want no matter the cost and by this their children the adults never seem to care for the psychological damage the divorce will have on their children and their families, all they care about is money and the maximise amount they can get even though they did nothing to justify such large payments. The Hrithik and Sussanne story, they were childhood friends she was a normal woman who married a extraordinary talented man who use to serve tea and sweep the set after his father finished filming. I hope Salman keeps to his words and does not get married and one more thing how long do you think Pryankra and Mr Jonas marriage will last, I hope it will last a long time but in the movie business you never know.
