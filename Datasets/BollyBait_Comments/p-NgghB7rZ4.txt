I never ever loved Kajol befor this movie the way they have written characters and needs.. a mother always tries to fulfill kids desire..but some where do fails too
Loved the dance
Kajol is just amazing.
Loveddd Kajol throughout this!
What a movie!!!!!
The movie may be amazing but the vulgar words spoken by kajol infront of daughter is not acceptable. Kajol was very loud throughout the movie. Director should have avoided it . It doesnt give good message. Moreover kids cant watch it.
Kajol has left ageing a long time ago
This movie makes you stop and think so many times.
Rubbish she didn&#39;t get the tribhangi pose correct.  It&#39;s the most graceful Odissi dance pose.
BAM NETFLIX
the backbencher rap is out on my channel risten it <br>i am a rapper
This movie has done a wonderful job in portraying women&#39;s real life and all the ups and downs in them
I loved. This movie it was so relatable and real

these two were brilliant. love Roy Kapur. he is so subdued and brilliant in his acting and loved Kajol so over the top and perfectly acted character. i desperately wanted to see her do a small Odissi dance though.
This movie itself is good...but especially this scene , it was awesome!!😎😎😎
Who thought that mithila means mythpat??
Kajol is more overacting. Mithila was excellent
Awesome movie..  Kajol just rocked
Kajol👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing
What a script and act
