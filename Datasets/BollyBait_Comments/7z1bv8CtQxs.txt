maturity is when you realise that both amrendra bahubali and bhallaldev doesn&#39;t deserve to be king of mahishmati because -<br>of course bhallaldev was terrible king but at the same time <br>amrendra bahubali had choosen devsena&#39;s love over people of mahishmati (who considered him to be the king) as a king sometimes you have to sacrifice your own love for the welfare of people of your kingdom. eventually devsena&#39;s love became weakness of bahubali as a result a wicked minded person(bhallaldev) became the king of mahishmati<br><br>your sacrifice for people of your kingdom makes you the great king if you chose your personal thing/person over the welfare of people of kingdom then you don&#39;t deserve to be the king
Still Gives me goosebumps everytime I come across this 🥺🥺

Anushka is so gorgeous. Absolute beauty just like Apsara. She&#39;s is more prettier &amp; talented than bollywood so called flop actresses.
Just one word is enough. &quot;Epic&quot;
Good. Women empowerment by bahubali. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=58">0:58</a>
Never ran out of arrows 😅😅😅
🕉️❤️🕉️
Netflix please add the Telugu versions of this movie please and thank you! Why is it so hard to find them! Damn! 😢😢😢😢
Sad to see om raut underused Prabhas in adipurush, where else Prabhas us a gem which should not be taken for granted
They have unlimited inventory in their arrows fr

Bahubali is the GAME-CHANGER of Indian cinema<br><br>And the DESTROYER of Bollywood 🎉
damn cringe northies crying over physics
upload in telugu raa lanjaa
I just watched these two movies this weekend and they were so much fun!!
Anushka ❤️❤️diva
The Iconic scene is still fresh.
When you feel this movie you will find powerful storytelling , beautiful cinematography , heart touching music , best acting , amazing VFX than other Indian movies and some mistakes but in front of thousands good things the mistakes are meaningless .
Bahubali ki baap hai rocky sala kya attitude hai rocky ka
This is my favorite scene. Olden days indian kings and queens and war those days.
😄😃💋💋💋

Nowadays prabas face seems different and swollen. Especially his nose and cheeks. He should get checked with a Dr.

I disregard the physics and visual errors in the scene just for Devsena&#39;s heartstopping stare while the arrows pass kissing her eardrops 😍 She&#39;s a perfect personification of a gorgeous warrior queen!!
00.47 ❤❤
Memorable
This scene has a separate fan base!!
After Adipurush ?
&quot;This isn&#39;t a time for explanation.&quot;<br><b>leaves a entire palace hallway full of dead guys</b><br><br>Like... we&#39;re not going to talk about what just happened? xD
Wished Adipurush had same seemless natural scenes rather then shitty VFX ....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=50">0:50</a> to 0.:53 is a full paisa vasool moment...<br>Not only Prabhas but also Anushka has acted excellently
At 1.42..the Bow 🏹 trick still is copied from The Scorpion king movie
This is crazy 🤣🤣🤣

bahubali defying all the laws of physics 🙄
The most ridiculous scene of this movie. 🤦🏽‍♂️

☺☺🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻👍👍👍👍

This Bahubali is better than the first even though it is quite corny in many scenes. Why? Because Amarendra Bahubali fought with his woman by his side. This movie completely makes female lead, well, a lead, and not a sideshow. Both look like they are a true match. There is no power dynamic between the duo, they complete each other. Forgive me but the two shooting arrows from one bow, is just the most romantic thing ever. And not to forget that scene where she walks over his shoulders.... The romance in this one is just iconic!!!
Leave the action, just look at those pillars, windows, background, archways. Bollywood will never match this
I&#39;m here after watching Rajat Chauhan&#39;s stand-up comedy! Crowd work, where he have this Bow and Arrow!!..<br>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
This scen is same as AVe Endgame Tony and paper secan
Even after these many years the magic of the movie is still the same.
Ah yes, my wife and mine&#39;s usual date night.
she is my beauty queen and most respected charater
I didn’t know we had soo many Indians in Ghana till this movie came out .
Dv6
After watching RRR, I still feel that this movie is much better. This was Rajamouli at his peak!
its amazing how she didn&#39;t flinch
3 soldiers came running from behind so that those arrows don&#39;t go waste
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=107">1:47</a> my favorite partttt like hellll omggg
Devasena: I was right, yeh bandaa nautanki kar raha tha abtak

This jodi is best
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=45">0:45</a> where the music , Devasena and the arrows hitting her Jimiki is just .... I can&#39;t express it in words .
Cut copy paste director..... Copy of Wonder woman
Taking arrows doesn’t end…
All bullshit..
Agar ye hero 800 saal pehle hota to koi bhi musalman shehenshah raaj na karta magar aisa bhand us waqt Badsha ke mehel me Badsha ka manoranjan Kate the
I don&#39;t know why this movie had so much exuberance. CGI looks animated. Simply terrible. I can hire a freelance designer and get that done
\
Physics 👉🏼😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
Anushka is looking really beautiful in this dress.
Why is Netflix India not posting the original scene in Telugu? Please respect the filmmaker &amp; post it in original language.
Teja ramcharan ? 😁
Best thing of South Indian movies<br>One arrow can know 10 people down😂
Amazing scene 💝
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=47">0:47</a> the tune was just mind-blowing😦
Their chemistry is mesmerizing.... I think I didn&#39;t feel any other actresses have this much chemistry with him....
Cheat code with unlimited arrows..lol😹
The only way Netflix will ever get Views..
I became Anushka s fan after watching Bahubali the conclusion. Combination of beauty with brains Anushka is.
Anushka and Prabhas please get married 💟
Noobde prabhas
SS Rajamouli is a genius
Fantastic attempt by Prabhas anna
Bahubali action sequences look like a bacha in front of RRR.
This is gem❤️
Shield piercing arrows
Devsena : ⛲ if yk yk🤣🤣
Prabhas🔥🔥🔥
Omg! How many arrows do they have? I could not see more than 5 arrows anytime
Dont fantasise a men will come and save you from anything....u r the only one to overcome anything in your life ...this s a fantasy and a mirage in women mind that men will protect us but in reality most of the partners never understand their wife emotions and left them sorrow full and helpless state...don&#39;t fantasis anything in movie
facke hai ye
Do they have unlimited arrows???
One of the best rajmouli illogical scenes.
The arrow which passed through the ear rings it poked my heart.
Who is here after RRR
When a backbencher turned out to be a topper!
Film that literally changed the face of Indian cinema 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰hatsoff to rajamouli and the entire team .....🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Hindi voice teesi telugu voice Petra YouTube naidu
Iconic couple ❤️
This scene is so stupid
He has unlimited arrows that&#39;s his super power
She slayed the role of Devsena!🔥
bgm... and anuska looks... speech less
Epic...
too Much arrows thrown.... Still bucket auto refilled.. tech game...
bitch they are having safety but how
unlimited ammo power on😁
Super scane for bb2
Amazing movie - they are great on screen,  they make a far better couple off screen. ❤
Then Bahubali now RRR 🔥🔥
abhi bata ne ka samay nahi hai....badme style se bata na parga😂😂
Does he apply any cheat code to refill the arrows
Arrows never get over for heroes typical indian cinema
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=109">1:49</a> pre firing 😂
unlimited arrow😂😂
Best 💯
This is sooo soo romantic
Till date, no response to this movie. Rajamouli took the bar, crushed it and made chutney out of it. The whole choreography od the scene is delightful.
I know a stupid North Indian who told RRR was taken by a man who doesn&#39;t understand or learned about gravity. I don&#39;t know what to tell them. If every movie should realistic or logically correct, then they should see award movies or stop watching Harry Potter, Pirates of carribean, Marvel movies etc. Can&#39;t you guys enjoy a movie as it is ? Why should you criticize everything ?
How are the arrows getting filled 😂😂 I wonder
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=22">0:22</a> sec, Devsena had only 4 arrows...... after complete fighting she stills has more than 4 arrows,......
Ye itne saare teer aa kahan se rhe h😂😂
The hype of Bahubali 2 and kgf chapter 2 was at unbelievable level !
The only guy with unlimited arrows
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=121">2:01</a> galat jagape galat sawal
Arrows khatam nahi hue inke
I am am here thinking how they have so many arrows and never run out... why did they waste 2 arrows for one person in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=84">1:24</a>???
INFINITY ARROW FIGHT 🙂
Love this pair prabhas anushka perfect😍🔥💯💯💯
Infinite ammo, no reload
Venustrophobia

Itnae teer mare par mazal hai teer khatam ho jayae
2 Golds archery.....Pakki baat....in next Paris Olympics 😂🤣
I didn&#39;t knew they both were using cheat code to get unlimited supplies of arrows.
Make no mistake : she is not a normal babe !! <br>Give her a pole as a prop ? She will place her left palm on it fiercely, rise above the ground , and roll around the poll thereby kicking all the useless downtrodden heads that are surrounding the pole to enjoy!! Thank you !! She is team God!! The God exists !!
That&#39;s how you should flirt. 😂
Hawkeye : may I come in?
Quiver has infinite arrows I see.
Overscaving this Bahubali
Greatest love story
Can someone please share the music of the video
That&#39;s the quickest KT given in a production environment 😅😎🤠
Boa Noite, vcs poderiam colocar mais filmes do ator Prabhas e se possível dublado...Obrigada
Fun fact:    Bahubali: The Conclusion had clashed with Guardians of the Galaxy 2 on box office and GOTG flopped miserably in India which is rare for a marvel movie.
WONDERFUL <br>💋💋💋💋❤❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

👍👍
america :- we have deadpool<br>bahubali :- hold my archery
one of the most beautiful scenes ever in a movie...
Devi Padmavathi(Goddess of snakes)  is my father. Yes it is true. I have born by her blessing.  For example I am like Karna ( in the &quot;Mahabhartha&quot;) who was born by the blessing of Lord Surya. If you want any proof please come at Guma Manasa Bare ( very famous temple of my father) in West Bengal and ask here. Here my father comes every Sunday. I not only want that people knows my truth but also I want that everybody knows my father&#39;s power and nobility. Belief or unbelief is your matter. Don&#39;t write nor think any hate speech about my father and serve her. My father blesses you. Thank you very much..
Hope Ponniyin selvan will rock !
Nice
This scene literally shows &quot; udta teer lena&quot;.<br>Whenever arrow were aimless, soldiers appeared out of nowhere to die....
42oss
In reality there is no fact in throwing 3 arrows with the same bow.😂😂

Indian are only heroes in their own movies .   They actually have ruled by turkic people.  They were not good in fighting nor in bows . Turks originally spread from altai mountains to all around invading lands ,  mongols also from same place and They were hard core warriors .

Goosebumps!!! &quot;BAHUBALI&quot; is Pioneer to Indian flim industry, it&#39;s like Indian flim industry before the &quot;BAHUBALI&quot; and Indian flim industry after the &quot;BAHUBALI&quot;😊😍
Netflix will never create such a good content,it&#39;s only promoting vulgar and adult jokes
hiii
UNKE TIR🏹🏹🏹 KHATA HONE KA NAAM HI NAHI LE RE😀😀😀
Masterpiece of the movie
Waiting for Part 3 😍😍😍
BAHUBALI slapped one cheek of BALLYWOOD and then comes KGF finding the other cheek. XD.
Shortest KT ever, that too in production environment 😎😎

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;
First, do you think this is even possible? 3 arrows pointing towards same directions but it diverts after release? Any bow/arrow expert here? please clarify
A movie which created a history.. A movie which depicts indian culture.. A movie which proves southindian industry is far better than bollywood craps
Lucky they got unlimited arrows.
Wazirstan has acssecpeted u as there princess
I really love this movie but if there is any other movie I would love to see on Netflix is jodha akbar the series and Razia sultan I would really love to see those series on Netflix
My favorite scene 😍😍😎😎😎😎
Me and my partner in call of duty deathmatch 10 vs 10

Infinite arrows in the quiver lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=39">0:39</a> the never ending arrows.. 😅
Arrows are not finishing at all
I am counting how many arrows are  remaining with anushka.its  shocked me
There was corona during days of Bahubali<br>Look at the enemies
🤫🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🤫
In ancient times this is how people show their and propose.
I have been telling my Learning and Development teams, we need training material like this.
OMG THE BEST AND GRANDEST MOVIE EVER
I am proud because it is a telugu film
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=47">0:47</a> 💓
It must be in original telugu language version Netflix....
Nostalgia
Nice👌👌
Anushka, should be given the role of Jhansi Laxmibai ❤️👍
1 of my fav scene 🤩👌🏻👌🏻🚩🚩💐
When you are Bahubali there’s an infinite supply of arrows...!!!😂
Their Chemistry is out of the world!!
1 Baat Bolu<br><br>Koi Hasega Nahin<br><br>Ok<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Maine Ye Movie Nahin Dekhi He 😎<br><br><br>Aur<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>KGF भी ✌️🤓
This still gives me goosebumps!
Why do we look for entertainment in Physics class and Physics in an entertaining movie.
Anushka Shetty &amp; Prabhas ❤ Fans 👍
Piche arrow khatam nahi hore bhaiii
ഈ രംഗം നന്നായിരുന്നു😁
What was the point in uploading this 🤷‍♂️🤧
Omg.. This scene was a lit🔥🔥.. And still I&#39;m obsessed with this movie.. Really it&#39;s one of the best movies🥰Huge fan of Bahubali 😘😘😘
Best movie, Best sence, with the BEST PAIR EVER 😍😍🥰👌💯👍🏻

Hey wasn&#39;t this film streaming on Disney+Hotstar, now netflix ia showing it on their channel..
KGF or RRR can&#39;t come near the hype Bahubali series of films had. Everyone was talking about Bahubali 2 when it came out. That&#39;s the side effect of Good writing plus a grand budget.
World&#39;s shortest KT 😂
prabhas🤩🤩💘💘
And here i am wondering <b><i>is their arrows infinite</i></b>
Uk i stay near anushka s homein indiranagar
This time:<br>Netflix getting views without effort on YouTube...😂
Cheers for those unlimited arrows🤗
Her expressions showed what it is to fall in love amidst attack/war ( this wasn&#39;t actual war tho) 😂😂
this is what she expects when someone says couple goals
Physics aur logic ki ma ka bhosda
The Name is &#39;S. S. Rajamouli&#39;<br>Waiting for R.R.R

Nostalgic feeling for box office king 👑 Baaahu 😘😍😍😍
Anushka looks gorgeous!
Set arrow ammo: Infinite<br>Enemy: Easy mode<br>God mode: On
stupid movie
ROFL moments 😂
I think 99.9%viewer&#39;s are students 😃😂
This scene is awesome but it looks like it came out of Rohit Shetty on Acid

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=70">1:10</a> this is my favourite part of this movie. Which is your favourite part of this movie? 👍Like.

ഉഫ്‌ pever
One of the best and effortless chemistry 😍
Just watched it yesterday night🔥

Finally Netflix Realised Importance of Baahubali 😂
As cinematic as this is, it still gives me GOOSEBUMPS!
I just wonder ki ye sala tarkash ke teer khatam kyu nhi ho raha hai
it would be better if it was in its original language!
Shortest KT ever given..that too in production environment..🙂
Always be hot
Unlimited arrows back<br>Never get finished 😃😃
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=39">0:39</a> this happen in games. Arrows come out of nowhere
Netflix you are very late
This is my most favorite scene in bahubali movies
Everybody was talking about this, and then KGF arrived.
There 2 side.....<br>One Bahubali. Indian culture , and ancient India..<br>And another Housefull 4..<br>Unnecessary foolish jokes.<br>🙃
He is just like me :-D
Dislikers are coolie no. 1 lovers

Most trolled meme of this movie that arrow scene 🤣🤣🤣🤣
If her looks can&#39;t lighten up your mood then  bro I don&#39;t think you should live on this planet 😍😍😊😊⚡⚡
I think netflix didnt have nay ideas for next videos i think
couple goals
Devsena ❤️❤️
Waiting for salar 😍😍
This the scene where *Bahubali*(Amrendra) Lost his Empire
One of my favourite movie scenes ever🔥
South Indian movies FAN ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Anushka is dead gorgeous ❣💋💯💥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=20">0:20</a> how can so many people die with only 3 arrows....3-4 people just lie downed 😂
Coming kgf chapter 2.

netflix just made my day 😇
Cartoon😂
One movie which shook the whole nation, Bahubali 💪
ANUSHKA shetty ❤️❤️❤️
Web series kaha hai bahubali before the biggning
Reminds of the scene where Shin Chan&#39;s aunt visited his school and competed with the school photographer in different and Unique pose
Best scene
Netflix just showing off the rights they have owned over this movie...
Yo why did you remove that video
Hey Netflix india we want pokemon movie I choose you in hindi dub
This scene made me feel like, I need to watch this film again right now 😍❤️
Mile gya @Netflix ka free Subscription
Why in Hindi?!<br>The original Movie is In Telugu<br>Upload in Original Language not dubbed One
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=25">0:25</a> No Bollywood Hero Can fit for that scene
When you realise Netflix didn&#39;t want to use the real voice of these excellent actors 😔 bravo boi bravo 👍😔
This film was okay.<br>First half was cliche like Housefull 4<br>It didn&#39;t much focused on his son.<br>Only first part had GREAT VISUALS.<br>It was Cartoonish in this one.
Hit a like  for <br>Darling prabhas..✌👍
After Avengers Endgame this was the only film for which I was so hyped!!
Mobile legend miya
Why do these soldiers even bother wearing armour, if it doesn&#39;t offer any protection.
Still now also for me stunning lighting,gousup
Arrow marte ja rhe par khatam ek bhi nhi ho rhe <br>See the big mistake
@netflix please take Telugu version
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=36">0:36</a> = Devsena has 3 arrows<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=52">0:52</a> = magic happens and now she has atleast 5 arrows with her.
Ram and Seetha 😍😍😍💕💕<br>Netflix ,why don&#39;t you plan this grandeur ?
devsena: rukiye ye infinite ammo ka cheat code kya h?<br>baahubali: ab ye btane ka samay nahi h rajkumari aaiye.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=100">1:40</a> 0.25x me dekho
This is the unique movie in film industry 💯🔥
Godzilla Singular Point Ka Trailer Kaha Hai Netflix 😡😡
Netflix is going to buy Bahubali 🥰
🥰😍❤❤
Love you Prabhas
Just came here for Prabhas
Ye itne pose mar mar ke kyu arow shoot kar rhe hai 😂😂😂
Just remembering the hype this movie had 4yrs before. Whole country was literally shaken😂.
Best Film I have ever seen. I want Bahubali part 3
People in movie clips: No science,no physics..<br><br>When they are asked physics questions : Katappa😠...<br>Hadh hein yaar😐
I am a 15 y/o 10th grader who is fond of writing songs..just uploaded my first original and would love to hear about it from the person seeing this comment..
Kya matlab tha ye scene daalne ka......saala you thub pr search maaro puri picture free mein aa jayegi 🤦🏻‍♂️
I know not to mind the physics and all, but ek bhi soldier ne shield upar nahi ki
Nobody:<br><br>My earphones inside pocket: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=105">1:45</a>
I loved this scene
Never ending arrows from the basket 😁
Love this movie but sad it ended if possible please make part 3
everything looks epic until the cgi arrows come in
🏹or🔫CGT
Something Very Very iconic.
this is the stupidest scene after that barrel throw scene in bahubali 2
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z1bv8CtQxs&amp;t=27">0:27</a> far cry 4 copy
Seems more like entry of Ginyu Force  from dragon ball Z 😂😂
Guys relax !! <br><br>Physics &amp; logic don&#39;t exist anymore.
I still keep watching these two movies bahubali 1 and 2 all Sunday s with my family .trough USB ,offing the lights..
Teer hn k khtam e ni hoty😕
This was just the trailer. Prabhas gonna do this on a much larger scale in Adipurush. Om Raut has asked Prabhas to get an archer&#39;s body.
Video daal ke paisa Kama rhe ho?
didn&#39;t posted original telugu audio , it is an insult for telugu language 🤔
Thank you<br>😊😊😊😊😊😊☺️
It is insulting that a telugu original was dubbed version was posted instead of original soundtrack

OP
Devasena: havent prepared for the test but knows even bestie didnt. Settles with passing score.<br>Bahubali (bestie): back stabs and attempts all questions. Scores exceptionally well.
wow
Evergreen cinema 🔥👍 Prabhas and Anushka 👍....Prabhas will look similar in Adipurush 🏹❤️.... eagerly waiting to see pubsu on big screen
