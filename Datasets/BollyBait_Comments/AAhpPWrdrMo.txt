Shilpa shetty hit Salman khan first in that scene and humiliated him and his mother. It seems you have not seen the scene properly. She herself pisses him off by saying maar ke dikhao mujhe himmat hai to in front of everyone. Its justified what Salman does to her in this scene.
smack my bitch up🇮🇳
Abuse glorified and personified=  so many Bollywood movies from 90s
salman did right thing to slap shilpa shetty in front of public
Salman bhai🤲🛐
srk&#39;s character in that movie is not heroic... and secondly he always suspicious about Juhi. and the Juhi is doing drama.. she was secretly an agent but she was acting as if the small town girls who will behave like that in real... and srk is having anger issue in it, due to trauma he went through also he behaves with everyone like that even with the kids... so even that&#39;s wrong... but in it his character is build like that and its not appreciated.
I just wanted to ask that you make matlab kuch bhi on every South actors also.But don&#39;t you find anything about some of the actor Ajith&#39;s movies.<br>Also Bhojpuri movies can also be included.
Why I love Thappad is coz these movies made me sick how women tolerated so much nonsense
Bro instead of criticism....try to make atleast one movie have both the comercial viability and social responsibility. Then u can know what director&#39;s and producers go through.
I feel embarrassed that I had enjoyed some of these third class films like Phool aur Kaante, Deewana, Darr, Dil, and many other during my youth. Right from the days of Shammi Kapoor, Dharmendra etc, most of the times falling in love means do the &quot;chera cheri&quot; with the girl, stalk her, harass her until she falls for the so called hero, so mean. I am still surprised that films like Kabir Singh, Pushpa and Bahubali with such regressive scenes are still in production
In that movie Shilpa slaps first Salman and then he slaps back ! I would do the same !! If anyone crosses limit to embarrass my mother and lastly so what is “ wrong in being mama’s boy”
I would slap if a woman or a man  talks against my mother ! SIMPLE !!
So according this douchebag if a girl slaps it’s fine !! Get a life ! You wannabe Mumbai English speaking cu*t !
Can I get English tuition from you online???
Yu must be living in cave. Yu don&#39;t know reality of india in 90s nor today. That&#39;s problem with urban higher middle class . They are not connected with real world. Most of thing they show really happen that why they show it. According to yu, movies  should be shown as idealistic world where every thing should be perfect
Shahrukh slapping Juhi is in no way unacceptable. She deserved that.
Twirl by salmaan😁😁🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I loved 1 2 ka 4 as a kid
कुछ भी समझ नही आया
हिंदी मे बोलने मे शर्म आती है क्या
Salman bhai😂♥️♥️♥️ Mother is everything
This channel just exaggerates small things to display them as a  big problem
Alternate title :.. Woke male feminist getting offended by fiction......
Bollywood all romantic movies are just bullshit
Watch movie as a movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=303">5:03</a>
Seriously Jammy defending shilpa shetty in Shaadi Karke Phas Gaya Yaar was not good<br><br>When a girl says &quot;Chhup ja apni maa ke pallu mai&quot; is not just provoking then tell me what it is!<br><br>This is not from a Salman fan or Shilpa hater, just a boy who loves his mom and I agree slapping is not justified in that case but she should not have said words like that.<br><br>Imagine if same words had been said by salman to shilpa for her dad that he hids in his wife&#39;s pallu then imagine the reaction from shilpa
I think you are born in 2000s
Add Dewaana movie also..in which Srk tried to convince Divya Bharti by stalking, threatening , harassing &amp; after all that against her will he married to her that scenes are so disturbing &amp; unacceptable.😒
People will always judge history as regressive and it is a good thing as it shows the progress we are making in social/cultural space.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Srk wala mast lga
Fantastic analysis very sensitively presented! Thank you so much!
On a serious note men who treat women with respect suffer the most..nice guys finish last
Physical abuses against men by girls are generally projected as comedy scene. This needs to be addressed too
ᕼIᑎᗪI ᗰE ᗷOᒪOᑎᗩ YEᖇ,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=252">4:12</a> is that George Michael in the poster?
please do make a review on &quot;Raja ki ayegi baarat&quot; too !
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=305">5:05</a> at first shilpa slapped salman...then in return she got slapped<br>the same happened in lucknow but the cab driver stood calm...is that equality....slapping an innocent person would make a girl feel strong, brave and independent ? literally our country needs to learn the literal meaning of equality ! I totally agree that bollywood movie are spreading shit everywhere....but we need to come beyond their thinking.....we need to understand what these stupid movies teach us is all bullshit, we have to keep our senses open !
Movies like Shershah, MS Dhoni, etc. And the ones with social message or a historic origin should get more appreciation than these stupid plotted films who were liked during the 90s... Which according to our parents&#39;and their generation were good... Seriously?!!
Almost a million subs ,  😎

at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=138">2:18</a> you can notice fatima sana sekh in right at the corner...

Oh, these scenes are so intolerable that the video is also getting hard to be bearable
Good job👍👍
New word invented- &#39;Phoroing&#39;🤣🤣🤣
I&#39;ve had such incidents, one was when a random guy in a flight does the Hadd kar di aapne, Ding ding ding on my arm.. it was shocking and very scary and heart breaking. Have quit watching bollywood for 4 years now. Thanks for pointing out.
Thank u
Bro use simple language
For the record, this doesn’t mean recent movies  depict everything brilliant.  Kabir Sigh is the epitome of this kind of behavior.. Number of cabaret songs are so high.. most of the heroines still are just pretty faces around the heroes. <br>People are dumb. They like to watch it. Even a lot of girls like this..
Women should be portrayed strong enough and should be given some idealistic and realistic roles. I&#39;m glad that there are films today that show women strong and give them roles other than dancing in bars and getting harassed.
Shaadi Karke Phas Gaya Yaar is the most regressive shit ever!
English speaking course chalo tum
Broo you&#39;re doing such a good work
Boycott Bollywood we won&#39;t new filmy city
Glad to see such progressive views and ideals.<br>Keep going ❤️
All thanks to u ...I have totally shifted from Bollywood
Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s not just Bollywood&#39;s doing. They are just showing representation of our society on screen. I don&#39;t find, apart from the Phool aur Kaante scene, anything &quot;Matlab kuch bhi&quot;. That&#39;s how our society behave. <br><br>It&#39;s definitely wrong, unjustifiable and shouldn&#39;t be tolerated on any condition. But even the so called modern people do the same under these typical circumstances. <br>Everyone should be treated equal irrespective of gender.
If we are talking about the salman slap we should even talk about katrina slaps akshay in sooryavanshi
Such a boring content u are simply reading
Video starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=43">0:43</a> thank me later
aap sahshi tharoor se coaching lete ho kya
Remember watching these movies in the 90’s in the UK and thinking what a bunch of nob heads! The scriptwriters and producers of these movies were definitely backwards and so out of touch! Those  super slaps were so out of order.. I mean who does that!!
It&#39;s so disgusting Omg how bollywood can even release this types of movies the writer and directors were so sexist and how a male actor and a female actor  even can do that why they didn&#39;t even Oppose this type of scene. 😡🤬🤬🤬🤬
Mr. Tried &amp; refused, I have seen a few patterns in your comments. You don&#39;t like eve teasing, sexual harrasment, violence against women and typical stupidity in Bollywood movie scripts and in film making. Well, reality is stranger than fiction. I can say this based on experience. Whatever movies show, in a country as big as ours, such incidents happen and will keep happening. Sometimes you come up with good interesting analysis but must times you come as a whining feminist. Change your outlook. See life and World as it is rather than ought to be
You did a great job there. We need more people like you
You are so right!
one 2 ka 4 had great music
Glad to get in touch with your channel... as a child, and with less maturity and knowledge and sense, I never realized that such films existed...i used to consider 90&#39;s films to be golden... but this is not the truth..
Absolutely love your channel.
Most worse roast video ever🤮🤮
Very accurate list people in 90s also realized it later and even 2000s kids realized it later
Shitty movies across all of 90s my god. Salman Khan couldn&#39;t act then also it seems. And ab toh pucho hi mat
Which is why Thappad released now💯<br>Changing people&#39;s mindset.
That Salman Khan scene looks like a natural scene🤣
You should make some reviews on korean movies or drama please 🤗
Seeing this old movies of 90&#39;s make me feel like movies are one of the utmost  reason of domestic violence and sexual Harassment..<br>They are showcasing as it is way common to do so...<br>Disgusting!!!
I don&#39;t think Salman Khan&#39;s character did anything wrong. Sometimes, the so called feminazi women deserves a tight slap on their full-makeup face. Same true for Boyz also l.
Heer Ranjha needs a vampire - werewolf re adaptation.
Sher toh kha jaega goats ko 🤔
Your English....👏👏👏👏👏👏
This mindset is needed in future generation,women are totally disrespected till today, no matter how many times one says tht they respect women., bt the deeds are always visible
That&#39;s Jethalal i guess standing right behind at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=184">3:04</a>
Thoda Hindi bol le
The reality is those old movies were based on some of the realfacts of India
I like your videos very much👍 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23keepuploading">#KeepUploading</a>
Still nothing has changed women are compared to &#39;red velvet cake&#39;. And who teaches Nora Fatehi those steps?? <br>Even one minute in those videos make me cringe so much that I get compelled to quit it🤮
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=180">3:00</a>, dude juhie’s character was undercover. She could not even if she wanted to.
Someone pls translate the last video what that man said ??? &quot;Lion son .... ?
&quot;Dupute ke niche kabootar chipe hain lololol kITnA nAtKHaT hAiN yEh lAdKa lololol&quot;
No wonder rape has become a part of our society now
And these kinda dialogues and scenes creates a very nonsense thought in men&#39;s mind that men are dominant. And these thoughts lead massive domestic violence.<br>In this era, 2021 still men think they are dominant and they become very cruel towards their wives. How long will it go like this??...
im gonna watch shaadi kar ke pgas gaya owo
Thappad is made on the revange of Salmans thappad
i don&#39;t think salman khan needed any rehearsals for that scene though...slapping your opposite sex is definitely not acceptable but insulting your spouse and his/her mother isn&#39;t acceptable either.
Physical violence abusing <br> is crime but in movies they show normal that effect young
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=302">5:02</a> is where the fun begins!
When Salman slapped Shlipa<br>The song in my mind :&quot;sorry darling sorry darling &quot;🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=43">0:43</a> I heard &quot;Main Boob mere Mehboob&quot; 😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tux5OReLAHs">https://youtu.be/Tux5OReLAHs</a>
Also, kuch kuch hota hai (a movie I loved as a child), when Anjali leaves Aman for Rahul (a guy who not only starts liking his ex best friend only after she starts dressing well and when he&#39;s lonely, but also breaks her marriage with a really nice guy... Not done)<br>Bollywood doesn&#39;t realize that not everyone in India is educated enough to realize the content they put out there is purely for entertainment purposes. A lot of uneducated people believe it&#39;s okay to imitate the characters played by their favourite actors :/
Do u really believe in the things that u spoken or it is just for youtube?? Sry if I am being offended to u..but many males believe slapping a women is ok..
These kind of movies won&#39;t work in 2021. Ppl are getting more educated and don&#39;t tolerate such idiotic shit. I cant believe the 90s directors and all thought slapping someone across the face and laughing off sexual harassment was a good idea for entertainment.
Salman Khan has slapped so many heroines in his movies 🤦🏻‍♀️
Kapoor and sons ? Lol have you even heard the lyrics of ladki beautiful
Phodoing their matkas....bhusa between ears.....😂😂😂
Fuck feminism idiot.... Salman Khan&#39;s scene was totally justified... I hate him but if any girl says a guy chup jaa maa ke pallu me in front of his mother after being drunk, this is the best we can give in return...
<b>Salman&#39;s repulsive behaviour in both movies as well as real life are the reason why he&#39;s is alone. He deserves to be lonely.</b>
Itne &quot;isms&quot; lagaoge to film maker film kaise banayenge
Now I know why millennials have so weird thought about love.
plzzz put subtitle in english
and there starts boys misbehaviour with girls to convince for loving them back in cheap ways or just not understand the meaning of no. It can just happen in India.😒
Love ur voice ❤️
I love ur channel. First time here, i will subscribe. Now i would like to stress on ur opinion: yes, the 90&#39;s was the time of big decline in indian (hindi) cinema. Remember &quot;Afsana Dilwalon Ka&quot;? Despite of the very beautiful music, it was a movie which couldnt make any sense, from the beginning till the end. The actors also had such an acting... like they were totally out of the story (if there was a story), like they didnt even read the script!! Another movie: &quot;Damini&quot;, this was a great movie, with a great message and amazing acting (Meenakshi Sheshadri). BUT: at the end of the movie they erased all of the huge thing that Damini had been fighting for: the concept of justice. Rakesh, the rich and pampered one who raped Urmi, WILL get punished eventually, thanks to Damini&#39;s determination for proving the truth in Court. But her husband (Rishi Kapoor&#39;s character), who was Rakesh&#39;s brother, will NOT be charged for conspiracy in hiding the truth and he will be even aplauded for his &quot;courage&quot; of finally admitting the truth, while in fact he was a dizzy  coward all the way through and his wife (Damini) would have died in the meantime - if she didnt meet Sunny Deol. But, of course, since Damini has suffered too much already, we need to send her sweet husband home with her at the end of the war, as a consolation prize: we cant afford to make her feel guilty for putting him in jail with her own wifey hand.
Phool or kaannte 😆😆
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23one">#One</a> 2 ka 4 ...juhi was playing a spy ,an agent ..after getting slapped she behaved in a comic al way to avoid being caught. <br>Some scenes can b ignored ...script demand.
Most old Bollywood movies doesn&#39;t age well even though at the time was a big blockbuster, while old Hollywood movies like Shawshank Redemption, Con-Air, Goodfellas, Heat, etc still holds up pretty well even today like it was released this year!

Fun fact : I never watch these shitty flims .
No doubt Bollywood is also a main reason of increasing rapes n molestation in India... cz Indian youth is mad after movies and they just get served with these garbage in the name of love stories. <br>This is how they&#39;ve changed the narrative of love n relationship in real life.
Boycott jihadiwood/gutter wood 🔥🔥

Musical of Bollywood 😅
Bar bar dekho!<br>Wat do u think bout this movie?
Don&#39;t try to judge the previous generations of people ( real or reel life) by looking in today&#39;s time frame. People in society become progressive as time changes. Have you not seen shitty 1940-1980 American movies? Was your father/mother/grandmother/grandfather&#39;s way of romance was same as that of Ranveer Kapoor you jackass. This is the problem of today&#39;s generation. We start judging everyone with reference to today&#39;s timeline and call ourselves more civilized instead of realizing the conditions of hunger, poverty, illiteracy, and 800 years of slavery. India is still doing well after all that shit happened. So you can relax.  This video makes no sense buddy. You can laugh but statements don&#39;t make any sense.
Salman slap neha dhupia joined the chat
U missed Kabir Singh. Kabir Singh is one of the most embarrassing movie in bollywood industry.
Abe Hindi aati hi Hain to usi main bol na Pura English bol raha he hum kya foreign se Aaye Hain kya ??
Omg this video just made me so sad and ruined my day. Disgusting bollywood movies. Reason I dont watch any movies anymore. Underlying stereotypes in every dialogue sometimes
If you speak in hindi it will be less irritating
Bollywood has become bane for India...n misleading youths
Great respect for you...

The comments section is full of beta orbiter, Knight wall ,chump, cuckold
Solmon bhai.....swag😂
What about Biwi no 1
How do people slap each other so easily? Just chill people.
Simp
&quot;Even Shakti kapoor&quot; 😂😂😂
All retro movies represented such disgusting norms..... N ppl today say that old movies were better.... Not at all<br>N sadly such things are still there in some regional movies.... They gotta change
Well there are many many such things in every movie so you should leave it instead.
Hi jammy- Please create a math lub kuch bhi playlist 😂
Even Shakti Kapoor 😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=30">0:30</a> that&#39;s what she said
Pls restrict the Matlab Kuch bhi content vidoes to only one per month .<br><br>They are getting a little boring and monotonous day by day
Omg yeh sab be dikhte hein movies yehi se crimes, domestic violence yeh sab kr cases increase hote hein... ... Wtf they had shown in the movies....
Jammy: &quot;imagine being so used to getting slapped across the face that it becomes the norm; it&#39;s rather scary&quot;<br>Me, who has to face the same everyday because of my mother:<br> 👁️👄👁️<br><br>Jokes aside guys, abuse is never ok, even in a family. I can tell you from experience or doesn&#39;t put a child in order, rather just makes them despise the person and make them want to be more rebellious.
&quot;Slapping them across the face, especially the opposite sex... &quot;<br><br>A huge applaud to you for using the word &quot;opposite sex&quot; not &quot;a girl&quot; 👏
Hindi dramas even in recent times are shockingly bad as well in their acceptance of domestic violence, murder, rape, forgiving husbands who try to sell their wives into prostitution- all this in the 21st century.
Ye to pahle ki movie h ... Salman ki .........but jammy agar Salman khan ko ye ab aisi movie Ka offer Hoti to aisi ghatiya movie Kabhi nhi karta Salman .....shadi karke phans gya Yaar ...kbhi ni karta
I remember how my elders in the family really appreciated when female leads were slapped by the male leads. They were like yeah slap her more 🙄😳 wtf! Even if I was a kid back then I felt weird how they were enjoying violence! I had question in my mind that what did she do to deserve an aggressive slap right in the face! Seriously!
No doubt Bollywood films influenced people in a bad way!!!!!
Bhai video hindi me banao... Kyunki  bollywood movies ko roast kr rhe ho to hindi me jyada mza aayega..
pHoDoInG the matkas
Salman boi hai na movie to logic ki kya jarurat
So monotonic voice that I fell asleep while watching this video. Lol.. People dont want to listen to a lecture about the funny scenes/movies, they want to be entertained! Use less words and more visuals/video clips. Dont give us a 1 page essay for every scence!! Hope you improve the content!
True but i m not promoting it at all but it was around 90s and poeple did not know that much it was just less of knowledge . what u say does makes sense ....par ky kre ab instead of blaming we should try getting better with things
Nobody is going to talk about Ranjha&#39;s eyebrows????
Just a question, not being literal right or stuff but... If that &quot;opposite sex&quot; slaps, is it okay then?
My whole life was a lie. I wonder how did I even watched these types of movies in my childhood? <br>I think because all the Bollywood or should I say most of the Indian movies were like this in that era.<br>Also, watching foreign movies or bold movies was considered bad like neither our parents watched any foreign movie nor they let us watch us. So we didn&#39;t knew there are way better movies than Indian. In fact we weren&#39;t aware about good Indian movies. <br>Thank god I stopped watching Bollywood movies after 2009. <br>I&#39;ve discovered other good movies.
Ab kabir singh bhi add krlo isme or is movie ka craze to sir chad k bol rha tha even girls wants a man like kabir singh 😂😂😂
Hope you will be boycotting Bollywood along with the SSrians.
Your analysis of these scenes is so just and am glad someone there is sane enough to highlight these actions and question them coz otherwise the rural india embeds these cheap actions and considers it to be okay to hit and objectify women
Jabtak cinema hai log <b>*&quot;*</b> bante rahenge.. This dialogue is correct..
Loved your intro 🥰🥰
Bhai tu movies main logic and modern thinking dhoodne kyun nikalta hai.<br>Take comedy as comedy that too of Indian movies.<br>Your now sounding cliche each day.
The whole movie &quot;izzat&quot; leaves you speechless. I have never seen anything disgusting than that
Ooo ranjha khel gya.... 😂😂😂😂
I really want a video on the over acting moments in bollywood
God there were a lot of awkward scenes in one 2 ka 4 and that Shah Ruhk slap scared me....
Wow....A man explaining how other men should behave towards women is truely commendable....
How Bollywood movies have taught us that it is OK to slap your wife to end an argument... and that Salman Khan slap was violence... It could brake someone&#39;s jaw
Bro first time i hv seen ur face n u r so charming 😀. Taarif ki hai bhai vesa koi interst nhi h😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
After a long time I have seen a video that makes some sense 👍
That line phodoing matka <br>Epic 🤣🤣🤣
&quot;even Shakti Kapoor&quot;
In shadi kar ke phas gya yaar , shilpa was doing soo soo bad behaviour and  she was abusing him  but Yaa slapping so forcefully  is not good ....
My heart skipped a beat at Salman&#39;s slap
The sad part is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=265">4:25</a> if you search up that video on YouTube and read the comment section a lot of people are happy and commenting how amazing bhai is and how they don&#39;t put such scenes in movies these days 😭
If shipa had slapped salman instead ig no one would have taken offence.
Yar these scenes doesn&#39;t leave me soeachles anymore
Your  english is farratedar
I didn’t understand the “meh meh” dialogue in the end. Was he saying that the brother got into bad company and did it?
Your contents are hilarious 😂
Sexual harassment in phool aur kaante was scary as a teenager
But like aren&#39;t there many movies where girl also slaps the male actor and it&#39;s considered alright,I mean slapping in general is unacceptable man and we&#39;ll need to this get this asap
Will you break up with your gf just because she slapped you once.?<br>Seems like yes to you.<br>Dude mistakes can be solved. Face it not move on.
Everything is just one tone.....and becomes monotonous after sometime.....I am rarely able to complete the whole video!
Why&#39;s Bollywood so keen on making the male actor either slap or stalk and harass women and make it seem &quot;heroic&quot; 🙄
Wtf bollywood 😑
In one two ka four Juhi acted weird because she was an undercover agent and did not want SRK to find it.
Sach m selmon ka 🤣🤣
I don&#39;t know why but I don&#39;t like the film &quot; hum dil de chuke Sanam &quot; it&#39;s songs were awesome and it includes the importance of tradition of India but the storyline is not so good and the acting is just out of my brain 😂 sorry agar kisi ko bura lage to...

Thank you for mentioning about shadi karke fas gaya🙄 aur bhi bohot kuch h isme!!
Raja ki ayegi barat script is written when the writer was high on weed
What we don’t see is actress’ also go with the story and perform and never object.   Now saying that they had to do it to survive in he industry is stupid. If they all had stood together against stupid misogynistic stories, they could have changed everything
I really don&#39;t understand how we as the 90s audience actually enjoyed these movies. I&#39;m ashamed. I&#39;m glad todays generation can see the mistakes of the past. Realistic movies and movies that enspire and teach us to be good individuals is what we need. Not this nonsense. Thank you for your videos.
Binge watching your channel for the past couple of days, I am obsessed for no reason at all. Lol
This is making me fucking sick. What the hell was even going on in the minds of the script writers? At least they should be banned now, not that anyone will be watching it anyway.
On one hand you criticize movies in which women are slapped and harassed, while on the other hand you justify artists doing movies like Kabir singh and directors directing them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=174">2:54</a> jethiya 🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=373">6:13</a> What u just  said one of the  most  insane and idiotic thing i have ever heard<br>This is a meme material
Can I knw ua introduction music name?
&quot;even Shakti Kapoor&quot; 🤣
Bohut handsome ho app
I would have got annoyed for gandefing my room!
&quot; Responsible of film makers affecting mental space of viewers literally bhad me gai thi is decade me &quot; 😀 well said bro.
What about a boy get personal to a girl and girl slap that boy.
People say 90&#39;s movies were one of the best but actually they were of the worst movies
But back then if its juhi-shahrookh or govinda-karishma...I would have watched,I was a kid then
Don&#39;t take movie&#39;s that seriously
The premise of that Salman Khan movie was infuriating. Seems like Salman always does movies that make women look bad, everything is always the women&#39;s fault. I&#39;ve said this before, I dislike him for so many reasons :frustrated-noises:
I am quite disgusted that Bollywood actresses went along with these movies just for fame and money 😏
Well... Well... Guess being a chocolate boy for feminist &#39;facts&#39; works wonders for   this fucked up generation who vomit on their own shit...
i dont respect actresse of 90s bcos wo sab randiys bas paise kamane ke liye aayi thi ... i respect tapsee pannu
that salman khan movie is a copy of the tamil movie priyasaki
Tu bhi to aise scenes ki kamaai kha raha hai😂😂
Domestic abuse is shown as perfectly acceptable in countless bollywood films. Perhaps that is a reflection of the society?
Very known bhagwan was doing same thing like Ranjha - gopiyo k sath.... director is inspired by the same imaginary god :)
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A person having a soft corner for the character joker doesn&#39;t mean he will be same in real life..<br>We r in a different zone while watching movies..if all the negativity is removed from the movies, think how boring they would be... Thats similar to removing all the negativity in life...So basically I am neither embarrassed nor shocked...
So is the Indian mentality
Bollywood is pathetic it is misleading our society.
You should add Jodi no.1 train kissing scene (govinda)
Bollywood is spoiling our mentality
Make one about Kabir singh
bhai twitter me ho kya..
List would never end
When will you make a video of female characters hitting male characters and how that is wrong! <br>One of them is Anushka Sharma slapping Ranveer Singh in a movie. He didn&#39;t even know about the slap and the slap was not fake. Fucking sexist.
That&#39;s why I stop watching bollywood movies
u fucker hypocrite, U just said slapping someone especially opposite gender.. What do u mean by that u fucker...tried and refused
Kapoor and sons and tamasha ko u brought in positive light...Sucker for a reason...
u forgot to mention about raja ki aegi barat, blatant on the name of movie
Ham sath sath hain ki bajao 🤣
What is the intro soundtrack name
Its her choice
Conclusion was epic🤣😝
and tamasha is also tatti
srks fan should dig a hole
First time I visited this channel .....I liked it very much....someone who talking about the reality of this movie.
Lol

Salman&#39;s slap was the idea behind Thappad movie
If a guy drunk as hell making a scene, personally abusing his spouse gets slapped not just slapped even if he gets kicked out of the house people will be like ye to honahi tha bevra sala but when its a woman getting the same treatment somehow it is illogical. If you have seen the movie you know Shilpa Shetty&#39;s character is a entitled  brat in an adults body. She is the real life incarnation of mega Karen. I know women are the most oppressed gender in India but that doesnt give the right to be a massive asshole
Do you have some problem inside your brain or its just you trynna make few bucks outta few old movie review that cant keep up w todays generations , even Ram Sita life can be on controversy how she was put on fire for test. Move on bro try focusing on new movie bro and one recommendation dont be walking up at the end of every review w that pubic ass hair and ask viewers to follow you tbh nobody wants to follow you
hindi me batao to kuch pata chale bolna kya chahte ho😡😡😡
Indian Movies do encourage violence against women..when it comes to correcting men the rage is directed towards the woman he is associated with like in &quot;Biwi No. 1&quot; and when it comes to women, it is her who is physically &amp; mentally  tortured...it&#39;s like &quot;saari galti aurato ki hai ye mard to saare sadhu hai..&quot;🙄..it is still happening in a different form, like showing that women are materialistic in relationships,  they are the cause of domestic fights and so on..😒😒😒
U r abso right..... u r the new gen..... welcome
I am addicted to your videos and now complied to comment here 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Salman thapar Mar kar ghoom gya par  Shilpa wahi khari rahi
Even shakti kapoor
Have you wached ghar wali bahar wali of anil kapoor
Disliked 👎🏻<br>Now your r taking it <b>too far</b> nothing is rather scary..<br>Dont knw abt other films but I&#39;ve seen 1 2 ka 4.<br>It was absolutely part of the plot!<br>You forgot to mention-<br>Juhi chawla was a secret agent &amp; keeping an eye on Srk &amp; her job was to do drama &amp; caricaturish behaviour so that no one could doubt her to be actually spying!
jo bhi aapne kaha shayad woh sahin hain par agar aap 90&#39;s mein  hote to shayad aap kuchh aur kehte
Hindi kya bolna nahi aati
This video is garbage
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=188">3:08</a> Islilye thappad jaisi films important hain...
That is why we call it movie because it has nothing to do with the real life and society... Please don&#39;t compare movie with real life
Gussa Matt krna Bhai but bolna sokha hai Bhai jinke paise lageh hoteh hai onko pta ki kaise banti hai movie.apne hisab seh theek banateh koi bhi nhi chahga movie flop ho yr
Salman ko wase toh acting nhii aati lekin ...thappad marnae mai my god 😬😬😬😬😬😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
Kitna bolte ho Bhai 🙄🙄
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=169">2:49</a> just now a movie called thappad is being released after almost 18 yrs where a lady want a divorce because his husband slap her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justathappad">#justathappad</a> <br>Sayad we have evolved to be better.
Slapping a woman is a criminal offence under IPC btw way. You could be immediately jailed and it won&#39;t be treated as just another assault case but a &quot;sexual assault&quot;. Wah Bollywood!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=288">4:48</a>..watch this in slow motion... 😂😂😂😂
But he&#39;s bhai yaar😂
Stop encouraging women for drinking... Drinking alcohol is bad for everyone... A women is much more than man
What about kabir singh then?
Why exactly do we idolise these clowns???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=88">1:28</a> why does Ranjha look like Drag Queen? Lmao! 😂😂
You are doing a great job in making people more sensible. Thank you for such a wonderful content.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=243">4:03</a>,now I understand why girls like such guys!!!
90s Bollywood is a black mark not just for the film industry but for Indian culture.  Truly shameful and regressive.
I still need some explanation for the last dialogue
hindi me bol do yar
well,bollywood is still the same excluding some thoughtful films..others r full of nonsense  with cheap item numbers.. and now new addition is remaking songs with badshah n neha kakkar..yuck!
Shaadi karke phas gaya yaar (i watched that film in Telugu starring Madhavan and Sada )There  are many more worst things in that movie along with slapping scene
My Goddess ! Jammy how scary and creepy these scenes are !<br>No wonder India is most unsafe place for women.
A boy should never hit a girl. Even when he is getting rediculed he should stand liptight. Even when a woman is hitting him badly , slap and slap across the face becoz of no fault of his he should not retaliate. Just lay down and take the bullshit guys becoz this way is the cool way. Ok got it .<br><br>But now I have a question ??<br>What about when a woman is demanding that during a foreplay.
Bhai Hindi Mai video bana English Mai jayda chalega nhi aur smajh Mai aata bhi nhi h
salmaan slap was horrific....
Are bhai tpdd khanewale kaambhi krte heloog
If u can  bang your 4wheeler over sleeping people ,Slapping or abusing seems quite a routine.Agar money power he tau sab maaf.🤔
Bjp wale ise dekke bolega anti national
Phodoing their matkas 😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=308">5:08</a> lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=303">5:03</a> drunk girls should get that <br>Even men&#39;s get it when they are drunk so there should be equality <br>&quot;If you want to behave like man then get treated like pne&quot;
No one should be slapping!!
Yarr....<br><br>Movies are movies why do you need to criticize them? If you like them talk about it...if you find them absurd pass through it
There are so many movies in 90&#39;s era with inappropriate scenes . I felt really ashamed watching these movies . So cheap . Thanks for making this video .
Salman is showing his true self in that scene...
If someone slapped me across the face, that someone&#39;s getting beat up by me.
Same thing with the TV serials like Pratigya where Krishna(gundda) forced her to marry him.
Hahaha&quot;even shakti kapoor&quot;🤣🤣🤣🤣
I couldn&#39;t agree with you more !! Your videos are great !! 👍👍👍
Epic 🤣🤣🤣
Eventhough Bollywood propagated such derogatory concepts, its great  that we all emerged to be good aware people.  :) We realized that these were nonsense and moved on.
is that lipstick?
Very true... hitting or slapping anyone... racism... crime scenes.. etc should be very carefully composed in movies...
But irony is we&#39;re not improving infact we are getting worse day by day.. example KABIR SINGH😝
And there are people complaining that Kabir Singh is misogynist. His life fell apart after that slapping thing
Ok so slapping women in the 90s is considered horrific, but when Kabir Singh does it in the movie, it&#39;s applauded. Moral of the story - movies are meant for entertainment and sometimes portray people who are not supposed to be perfect. If that&#39;s the case, we will only have movies where the protagonist is always the perfect person and the antagonist can do whatever he/she likes, and movie like Kabir Singh won&#39;t exist.
If a Salman Khan really beats like that to heroines will go coma.
I love you hard work over research and each and every video bro! Keep up!☺️👍 Stay blessed
Ek tappdh ki kimat tum kya jano.
No wonder why women face eve teasing in our country. Bollywood glorify it.
Shadi kar k fas gaya yar was the worst movie I ever saw!!! Pathetic...it was mentally exhausting and soooo patriarch
I remember, boys at my village used to do the same - write &#39;I love you&#39; and extra rubbish on the gate, wall, even on the floor, where the girl lived. They must have taken this from these movies only.
What are you saying at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=95">1:35</a>
Ohk current films are worse. Lol.
One 2 ka 4 was fun to watch.<br>Bro he slapped her coz he couldnot imagine the girl he had feelings for was dancing in a bar. N the girl understood that. Jeez
How Salman khan gets mad if a guy abuses a girl in biggboss, and he himself did a movie scene “Slapping a girl”.....double standards bolly stars
No  wonder now that women are becoming more empowered they are beating up guys  too instead of staying quiet.<br>The downside now is however, innocent men are falling victims. Like deja vu happening.
Bollywood is full of misogynistic portrayals. Sad!
How could you miss that absurd movie called “Ladla” when Anil Kapoor slapped sri Devi 😒
All these were hits even if you talk BS about them. Find something better to do with your time!
I think it’s important to understand the level of sensitivity that people had then and what people have now. Back in the 90’s people were more tolerant to movies that showed sexual comments where now people will not tolerate it. We have matured as an audience.
Thanks for the clean language and descent comic script...a rare sight in today&#39;s media.  Somehow all resort to foul and crass comedy and consider it humorous.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=167">2:47</a> Sach Mai Thapaad mara KY😦
Isko girls ki bohot pahdi hai
Never has such hero&#39;s like Salman shahrukh Nd juhi have asked for forgiveness for doing such scenes , dey have destroyed people minds in villages where this happen
I M V.HAPPY CUZ <br>.<br>JO GUYS EQUALITY LIKE KARTE THE ...THEIR GF/ WIFE TREAT THEM WID LOVE + RESPECT  .<br>NOT AWKWARD FEAR <br>.<br>.<br>N JO THAPPAD MAARTE THE SUCH GUYS AB JUUTI KHAA RAE H <br>.<br>.I MEAN FEMINISTS R KICKING THEM LIKE SHIT
What is the movie title where Salman slap Shilpa Shetty?
I have noticed that Salman don&#39;t have an iota of respect for women.he only respects his mother and as if all other women are <a href="http://worthless.in/">worthless.in</a> one of his movie &#39;ready&#39; he had a dialogue at the end which was so cringing and the most disturbing part was that all the men in the hall was clapping...the dialogue was somewhat of Asin.she said Salman to help in fighting with his relatives rather than marrying because you can get another wife but not another father (seriously kuch bhi) ..and Salman said &#39;pehli bar kisi aurat ne samajhdariki baat ki hai&#39;....I mean what do u mean??
Dude stop the shit...<br>That was 90&#39;s...<br>So stop comparing between there and now
Shadi karke phans gaya yar is a disgusting movie u forget the end scene when shilpa &#39;s father  hit her mom to get her straight
U know you are one of the few men I have come across...who feels so strongly about this regressive shit about women and toxic masculinity that is so rampant in our films.....full points and respect to u for that
Bkk  badhai bhi kar de kabhi
all old indian moviez are crap make me laugh every time, esp their dance :p
all old indian moviez are crap make me laugh every time, esp their dance :p
How these films are allowed to be released
Kabir Singh is the most regressive movie of 2019
The movie hum saath saath hain... The whole film was a waste of time and talent... They had advised all the actors not to act but to only feel shy... The whole movie u can see only that... Matlab kuch bhi
Police arrive to arrest the Villian just before the End of Movie. Please make a video on this topic.
I&#39;m sorry but Salman&#39;s slap cracked me 😂😂
sari baaten to thik hein but your English 👍👍😂
Your are more  annoying  thn these videos
Bollywood has produced some shitty movies which decieves every common man. It represents as if Physical assault/harrasment or any other crime against the other is quite normal! What the Fuck Man!
Trivia:-<br>The actor of Mehboob Mere.. Is Sujoy Mukherjee son of actor Joy Mukherjee(Lee Gayi Dil Gudiya Japan Kiii).<br>The actress is Pratiba Sinha ddaughthe of actress Vidya Sinha(ooo Merte Mitwa ,oo mere meet ree, aaja tuzko pukare mere Geet ree...)<br>Actress Madhoo in Phool... Is niece of actress Hema Malini.
That slap at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=302">05:02</a> had me rofl for 2 hours straight
90&#39;s movies were shit except a few gems which don&#39;t get much recognition.
You should have not included one two ka four in this list because juhi&#39;s character is a comedian one not a serious character which will think logically before marrying a man and the comparison is clearly seen in the mivie shadi karke phans gya yaar where salman slapped shilpa because they are intellectual character with logical sense.
Any thoughts on scene from &quot;Dum Laga k Haishaa&quot; ..Bhumi and Ayushman slapping each other
Really nice video
Why don&#39;t u acted in all these movies
I have to be honest when I heard mehboob oh mehboob I thought there is going to be too much boob that&#39;s why it is on the list but he let me down 😅
Your voice ♥️♥️♥️♥️ dam
u can also add kabir singh...when he was slept the heroin
Billy Madison to end the video . 😂
It’s not u don’t hit women but u don’t hit men also equality comes along with respecting each other not men nor women are exceptional
One two ka four z such a baseless movie.... itni overacting movie hai
I subscribed,:).Love the content you are putting out in your videos.
I love ur voice... Soothing😍
wow that was hilarious.... really a good research... <br>i would also love to see videos of same category and more like dumbest, senseless, completely foolish and speechless scenes from the movies released in past few years.....<br><br><br>i must say after seeing most of your videos,<br>i really think that if you make a movie someday, i mean write, produce and or direct it... <br>it would really be a &quot;Masterpiece&quot;.... <br>without a single small silly mistake... and full of sense... <br>and you will also get an award or nomination in each category...<br><br><br>by full of sense i mean for example just came in my mind, if someone drinks water from the glass and put it back on table. and now the glass left 13.7 cm filled, it should be kept filled 13.7 cm at the same position on the same table for that whole scene which may gets shot many times in a day or two...
Ur channel is a shit....u should stfu now
Brother plz make a video on SAMRAT &amp; CO. .......W8ING
Tere channel ka nam refused production hona chhaiye.... Bhencho shuru ke 2 min me tatty h....
Salman in movies and Salman in real life are the same.......toxic masculinity cherished by bhai ke fan. Don&#39;t even start with that being human charity thing he does. It&#39;s just to cover up his toxic stupid masculine personality and his previous crimes
I was that juhi chawla girl, thankgod I broke up with him
I don&#39;t understand these are films aren&#39;t they? films will show both good and bad about humans, regarding the sadashiv amrapurakr scene he is shown as villain not as hero matlab kuch bhi videos banate ho yaar
Thumbs up!
It&#39;s bhai.... so anything is a super hit 🙄😪<br>Bollywood audience is great 😪
I&#39;m gonna watch that first one with my friends xDyass
I dont know how many agree, but this has ACTUALLY affected our society and uneducated youth to try similiar things.
u r right......thats y i dont like bollywood
Bro these are just a movies...  fictional films.. Why are u taking it so seriously... Who the hell has asked u to correlate with reality..
This is a SJW channel
I guess that was the norm during that time..women empowerment has been a recent change,besides media creates a mentality in individuals sad to see it was like this during that time....still a long way to go though
Bhai kch bi kaho..hindi m sunne m alg hi maza aata h
I think in 1 2 ka 4 juhi had to react that way.. As she was undercover cop playing the role of simple caretaker.. She was supposed to make shahrukh believe that  she was the same and could not break character (personal opinion)
Saala bollywood walo ko movie banana nahi aata,south se sikhna chahiye
90s bollywood is just like a porn no logc inside.....
Finally a good review
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=373">6:13</a>
Plz go through this movie &quot;Manchali&quot; on youtube<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K00dLlFg0uM">https://youtu.be/K00dLlFg0uM</a><br>At 1hr:45min there is an awkward scene of domestic abuse by husband to wife in front of her uncle, and the uncle is supporting the act
I laughed so much on most of this women have bhoosa in their ears 😂
Salman slap😂😂😂😂
I actually feel shilpa shetty deserved it... mujhe bol theek hai... maa ko kaise  bola... divorce
Bhai hindi me bhi bol skte ho
Is <b>Regressive</b> your favourite word?😌 @Jammy_Pants
Salman thappar marke khud e ghun gaya😂😂😂
Bollywood:  their more to come😂😂
Slapping someone who goes way out of line is actually good because it gives that person a rude awakening &amp; much needed lesson. It’s called tough love ❤️ &amp; it’s old fashioned cure for Feminists.
&quot;Even shakti kapoor&quot;😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄 that was so hilarious
Scenes? Entire bollywood is &quot;just kuch bhi&quot;😄
Mr jo b karvalo is also one of the most idiotic movie so far......😔😔😔😔
What about Vikranta
this is insanely disgusting 😤😤
just one thing plz keep on doing such vedios for such basic knowledge..... very necessary for the society...!
Why couldn&#39;t u speak in Hindi about Hindi movies ...your commentary sounds so unnatural ...I am stopping this half way.
Ye channel vala pagal hai mtlab logo ki copy krk kuch bhi banana h ,
I love your narration man!
Late 80s- through 90s stories and script was really absurd , God knows what happened. Koi bhi movie banane lagg Gaya tha shayad, underworld ka paisa wala movies perhaps. And even movies with well known stars had a lot of sleaze, misogyny and mindless violence. It&#39;s really sad decade for Bollywood talent.<br><br>But the silver lining is perhaps the songs of 90s. Even below avg movies had good songs some times. And songs were really memorable, compared to don&#39;t remember that happened last month kinda music.<br><br>Tseries and Tips churned millions perhaps. and with MP3 they shifted to producing movies, coz the music biz took a hit.<br><br>Even AR Rahman s earlier music is so good. it&#39;s hard to believe it&#39;s the same guy making music now.<br><br>Just like Sachin, the early and mid careers were trailblazing. but last leg is kinda just cruising through, playing safe.

Aishwariya ko bhi aisa hi laga tha thappad
Bollywood ne Indians ka mind brain wash kiya hai or karte aa rahe hai. Ek aurat ko iss tarah se pesh karte the movies me jese ke koi khilona ho jo rasaoi tak or jism tak hi simit hai. Shame on bollywood. Ghatiyapanti faila chuke hai wo ab hai ke logo me samaz aa chuki hai isliye ab sab kuch bahar aa raha hai.
Ok i posted the previous comment in the middle of the video.....just saw the end....hahahahahaha.....<br>One word for you - brilliant<br><br>Whats the name of that host whose shot you have in the end?

If you wanted to be a perfect man stop watching bollywood
Salman&#39;s thappad of the century
Amazing content. Thanks!
Honestly while growing up with all these movies - such though never occurred to me. It was when I went actually went to school, college, subsequently University and then abroad - all of the absurdity became apparent that oh my dear Lord, that was cringe-worthy. I remember watching all of them with no cringe.
The number of Bollywood scenes of sexual and physical abuse on women is astounding. No wonder it is a household thing.
How can u watch these nonsense n illogical movies with so much patience . Then find out the sensible things out of it after watching carefully for almost 3 hrs
In many more hindi films women have slapped men. But you won&#39;t make video on that. Don&#39;t show us the half truth and don&#39;t  mislead
Movies are Mirror of society...
Kabhi kabhi thapad marna jaroori hota hai
Bollywood is trash. Only a handful of movies are worthy to be watched. I don&#39;t watch Bollywood anymore.
You have impeccable English speaking however, sometimes you make video without any content as we all know many movies like this in which no sense has been used by movie maker...bro start making video which should be add on in Indian movies..
Al this goes through the inspection by the movies sensor board n they stil approve all of this by default.. but if ther is a kissing scene they immediately stamp the movie as an A movie n if any movie shows the truth then they ban the movie!! Ther is no standard in bollywood movies n that is the main reason for so many rapes and molestation in real life of women all ovr India coz seeing such movies the uneducated and educated men think its ok to do anythin to a women coz anyways she cant do anythin but cry or fal on his feet!!
This video deserves like coz it’s hell true and people should now get aware about these foolish things
Salmans slap = equality Don’t care male or female 😂😂😂😂
I love that you shine a light on these kinds of scenes in films. Your awareness is appreciated man, as it&#39;s a big concern of mine.  The one that really shocked me was Salman punching the shit out of Shilpa. My jaw dropped. WTF. And aren&#39;t big stars have say in what their characters are doing, it&#39;s so ridiculous.

I am seeing ur videos from 3 days n i am actually liking these videos .... There&#39;s 1 request please make a video on one of the stupid movie of our Bollywood obviously from 90&#39;s which is filled with idiot , useless and vulgar dialogues ... Where was the sensor board at that time ? <br>Movie name :- Gunda ....<br>N yes i am ur new subscriber 😊😊😊😊 ... Stay blessed
First and foremost thing i totally agree with you .. and ur points but as a human no a gender thing but no one should ever encourage wrong behavior towards any sex male or female... Man slaps women what a coward man women slapping a man what a cheap man.. how the heck that thing is right
Bhai, ek baar Aitraaz movie a review ko kisi list mein include karo
Slapping the women on being raising her voice is not any illogical thing when it comes about Indian culture .<br>So the director had featurized the harsh reality of Indian people&#39;s behavior towards women .
Tbh, apart from review, you have really good thoughts about how things should be
1. Ladki ki na main haan hoti hai - has ruined the entire generation.<br> 2 Smooching a girl forcefully in public. And the girl later fall in love with the guy....I mean seriously???

My dad said his times were the best it seems.
What Shitty Pants forgets:<br><br>These are movies<br>The times were old<br>This might not be actually happening in society <br><br>When Modi says to Akshay Kumar, he is afraid to joke these days coz of Urban Naxals perceptions, he exactly meant what Shitty Pants is trying to intellectually say.
movies are both a ray of light and mirror of society
Thank you for making me dumber
Whats the song name in star of video.
Very good... Really filmmakers sometime don&#39;t think about anything
&quot; kaun hey yar kya hey yar &quot;
I truly appreciate your understanding maturity and mentality. We truly need people like u in the society.
Just wondering the reason of dislikes..
That chaanta omg
Couldn&#39;t the actors (the biggest ones in Bollywood) just read the scripts and omit the parts like this? I just want to see the reaction on Shahrukh&#39;s face when he watches this scene because you know Salman will just start driving after watching his.
Bollywood seriously ill 🤒🤒🤒
No wonder y am going through depression.<br>Fuckall creating movie scene violence on women have influenced our Indian audience pathetically that it&#39;s justified to touch man handle girls women no matter even if it&#39;s not her fault. If a woman says or does something wrong then hitting slapping her is normal n if it&#39;s man abuses, does cheap things, yet woman are threatened and hurt again. Just coz chutad society mindset, considering most man can do anything., difficult for woman to fight against evils. <br><br>No offense to all male fellows coz I have been victim of threat, violence sexual abuse, despite of the pain I been through I couldn&#39;t fight, coz I was weak in terms of support, physical n lack encourage as they say ladkiyonko Mardo see jaada dukh jhelna hay. Yehi zindingi hay yehi ladkiyonki taqdeer hay.<br><br>No wonder most women behave n sound like feminist.<br>Some day I may kill or murder some one when I lose all my patience.
You talk to much. Talk less and show more movie clips. We can identify the irregularities...
Salman khan&#39;s movie shadi karke phas gaya is a tamil movie remake priya saki(2005)
Rather than long monologues it&#39;d be great to create video of such scenes with little gap between them.. you&#39;ll thank me for suggestion..
Please cut out the constant background music

Now a days: It&#39;s ok if woman slap man, but &#39;kuch bhi&#39; if man slap woman.
Your intro is long and irritating.. please understand we watch content.. not your intro
These movies were a shame and that time was also backward.... I&#39;m glad now we don&#39;t get to see all this bullshit n now at least Bollywood has developed enough, and most of the movies now have good message and are productive and meaningful
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=320">5:20</a> why? If it was a man in the place it would be fine but just because there is a women it&#39;s wrong? So a women can come up to my face and be obscene and vulgar and I have to stand there and do nothing. But if I did the same she could slap me and society would think it as it&#39;s ok. Women want equality why not give it to them?

Thank god for mentioning shaadi karke phas gaya is the most amazing mention I hate this movie the most sexist shitty movie the whole movie is full of forced shit
Even Shakti Kapoor 😂😂🤣
what dose the movies now a days encourage please explain that too😂😂😂
please take a look on Ekta kapoor, Ramgopal verma ,  Sanjay Leela Bhansali ....and many more in list are the scenes of those movies 🤣🤣 not speechless
what i think when those old movies were made at that time our indian film industry was like a child  trying to perform a stage show with lack of guidance and the people of our country were like just  enjoying it bcoz there was no internet no wikipedia no mobile phone 🤣🤣no pornhub but today when people are too ahead like a 20 year old boy from those old times have less iq and knowledge then a 10 to 15 year old kids now a days . My point is that its not justified judging those old movies and blaming the movie makers ...if u compare those movies to new movies ..according to me they were nice and good for that time 😂 as now if u see how much difference ..i don&#39;t see  any difference ...if u are really a bollywood movie reviewer please do it genuinely and properly and keep in mind that 20 years gap is a big difference ....but still a typical bollywood movie has same 2d content🤣🤣🤣 ..they have not moved a millmeter acording to me
😂yes people now a days have an iq to see what the difference in between reality and movie and what should not be shown in movie but that&#39;s funny bcoz  i think what u see now a days in movies is far more disgusting😂😂😂 then those old movies please use your iq on new moves i challenge u will find it far more disturbing 😂
I am seeing a glaring connection of mindset between bollywood and interior India. Bollywood is the culprit for a regressive India. Think about this.
1 2 ka 4 sounds like Hum Hai Rahee Pyaar Ke. But of course HHRPK was awesome.
Good content.
evan shakti kapoor😁😁
You should carry on this. . Seriously...
If you haven&#39;t yet, you should definitely check out &quot;Kuch Tum Kaho Kuch Hum Kahein&quot;, a Fardeen Khan movie. It has a family feud scene where a man throws a dish which kills a person by slitting his throat!!!
Gosh you are so boring and annoying
Brother you are salil jamdar???
Just fell in love with your voice😍😍😍
Where&#39;s that scene from at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=380">6:20</a> ?
Dupatte tale do kavutar chhupa rakhkhe hainnnnnn😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😁
Not suprised salman hitting a women on screen it Came out so natrually thru him thats wat hes been doing in his real life too hammering the shyt outta his gfs aishwarya , katrina and cld b many others too ..
Next time please add Rani Mukherjee&#39;s debut movie Raja Ki Ayegi Baraat to you Matalab Kuch Bhi list. Its a legit Matlab Kuch bhi. Matalab kuch bhi hai us movie me. Rani mukherjee&#39;s character marries her rapist. She is abused and beaten up by her in-laws regularily, still she strives to get her husband&#39;s love. Matlab kuch bhi.
Where is the drawing scene or the stripping scene from Bahubaali
accha hua rgv aa gaya tha nahi to bollywood barbaad ho jata

Kindly don&#39;t speak hindi it sounds awful from u
Yes u brings the right wrod I was watching your video and thought Bollywood so much nonsense thing is our society if we like them they should bring some social message like women empowerment
I am so glad i have subscribed to this channel. You do a good job mister.
&quot; Even Shakti Kapoor&quot; 😂 I spilled my drink lmao
Can you please put English subtitles for the Hindi dialogues. I really enjoy your videos but get lost when there is a dialogue 😃
Don&#39;t you think your videos are too one dimensional. Embarrassing scnes mean only violence against women? It could have had more variety of situations.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=315">5:15</a> Really? There are countless scenes in movies where one slaps opposite sex and no one has any problem with that. You know what I mean?
Your videos are so Awesomely entertaining. 👍👍
I felt this all the time..tht how men n boys smtimes behaves it all just affected minds bcz of Bollywood..they only know to slap a girl when she disagree to them.... N the real thing is....girls really get in trap bcz if she scold him to slapping her..he ll try some bad shit against her..so in India I have seen girls gets down just to close whole scene..........I can tell details bcz I have gone through this....some boys treats a girl like she is smthing an object..just like..she ll never get hurt evn if u slap her with ua whole power..this is how may b some boys thinks.....n if there is their own sista..thn they feel she is getting hurt..thn why won&#39;t they care for sista of some one.. ..........if a girl shows her own decisions in her on way....al the time tht one girl gets hurts by boys specially.............itz a very dirty truth which I personally faced.
Violence in any shape or form is wrong whether it was inflicted by either gender<br>In an ideal equal society
tried and fucked productions
Very nice collection.Horrrible Bollywood
Salman khan’s acting while slapping 🥴oh gosh that was ..... I am speechless 😶
Bollywood has not art in creating love story. In Indian culture live story is guy falls for woman or woman falls for guy they start stalking them and guy kidnaps and beats woman if she does not say yes to his love and woman might threaten to commit suicide if guy does not say yes to her love and then these example shows they have no talent in creating romance. Just watch anime or South Korean movies, they know hot to create it .
Or Race 3 full movie ...tou bhul he gaye
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse in that Salman-Shilpa scene. The slap or the fact a drunken woman kept on verbally berating her husband in front of so many people, yet the family members just stood there and let her go on and on like a bunch of morons.
Feminism ki maa ka bh@$da
Plz make a video on annoying Indian tv shows
The content is always gr8 but i  just came here to listen to ur voice 👍
Show the scene. Not ur bagbak
Dude all movies are for entertainment purposes, the movie should be viewed in that context as well as the context of that time. For all your complaints and hate I have never once seen you point out mistakes in films made abroad. I ll give you a start go look at any Disney movie featuring the character Uncle Roofus (these were made for kids). As time goes on the industry matures and slowly these mistakes are corrected. I like your channel but do wish instead of all the negative you find maybe be put in a positive one here and there too. It cant be that our movie culture has not produced anything to feel good and proud about? Any ways wish you the best and congratulations on finding a niche for your creative content.
Please check out this song of Arshad Warsi. You can make whole video on this shit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5mTlQFTrU">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5mTlQFTrU</a>
Just wanted to say this , so me and my best friend cursed( to each other) and the girl sitting in front of us asked us if we spoke ( what she calls) “non—veg”. We were a bit confused as to what she meant by “non—veg” but turned out that she was shocked that we cursed ( the boys sitting next to us cure All the time) so i see this general stereotype that girls aren’t supposed to curse and i think it comes from such media influences , which NEED TO BE CHANGED!!<br><br>Sorry for such a long comment
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=302">5:02</a> what the fuck
Not being a Bollywood buff.... don’t know how I came across your channel but I’m glad.
Loved your perspective though I haven’t seen a single movie shown in this. You still managed to make ur point beautifully come across. Very impressive selection coming from an opposite gender
prepare video on how can make a videos please.
Bollywood has a shameless history of using blackface. And how about them using Chinese culture in movies? Since when is it ok to use someone&#39;s culture to make money?
Thanks for pointing these things out
Abeee...ab tum aadam jamane ki movies ko kyu hi compare krre.....talk sense...no one is watching mehboob mere mehmood in time of Got...talk about pros n cons of nudity...issues related to cinema nowdays..not some random bullshit
Not that justified
Boy is it an underrated channel!
My comment could be taken in bad light, I’m a feminist by all means but I have a question. Clip 3- if Salman khan gets riled up after shilpa is insulting her MOTHER, and slaps her back, How is this baffling? Respecting women, loving them, looking up to them is one thing (I am all in the same consideration) but hey, I’m not taking any shit against my Father from a man, a woman or from anyone at all. @admin, I really want you to answer this one with an unbiased POV. <br><br>Disclaimer 1- I love this channel<br>Disclaimer 2- I am a feminist too<br>Disclaimer 3- I am not a bhaitard 😂<br><br>I am just looking for an answer
The saddest part is that she was still standing after salmans punch xd and nobody even interfered xd that&#39;s movie logic for u there... Nono, that&#39;s Indian culture for u there xd and salman proves to pack a fkn pussy punch^^
Faltuu video of TRP
Abe chutiye...movie ko movie ki tarah le na..movies are simply narration of a story...don&#39;t make a fuss over everything..in India,, movies aren&#39;t the only place where you see such social injustice.. you can see it around in your society as well...instead of cribbing over scenes...walk out and bring a chance in the society around you if you can.. Let me know if you are kicked on your ass for doing it.
Salman Khan&#39;s character slapped his wife ! <br>And what was that sher ka bachcha dialogue man!
As my opinion .... bollywood actually played a very big role to destroyed our society manners specially the old movies.<br>I remember a movie in which Rani Mukherjee got raped and decided to get married with the guy it was huge disaster
One suggestion for your video sir- make a video on how in the Saas bahu serials they portray that woman who wear ethnic and are sanskari are the best. The girls who wear dresses and drinks are supposed to be bad girls. And that&#39;s what the aunties talk about!<br><br>And one that a poor girl always gets a rich man. Always
Bollywood has to undo this...so let&#39;s give them the benefit of doubt that they were really not thinking what they were doing at that time!!!......So....from now on every Bollywood movie will have the woman slapping the hero at least twice...one before the interval to get him thinking right....and second one to ascertain that SHE is the BOSS!!!
Do something on old indian movies like v shantaram....Sujata.... saraswatichandra
Boi... I just love your content
Remember that obnoxiously insane scene in jaani dushman where everybody convinces manisha koirala to forgive the boys who tried to molest her....I KNOW MOVIES CAN BE SILLY BUT THAT WAS A NEW LEVEL OF INSANITY
Ur voice man!!! 👌👌
Hey can you let me know the last scene is from which movie?
Wtf... Are you turning this channel into *feminism*, I barely laughed....<br>Are you trying to impress your feminist Girlfriend? 🙏
The best channel on YouTube which never disappoints me
Where was censor board all this time
Everyone in the comment section are foreign born people watching hollywood movies from the day they were born, now mercilessly   trapped to watch and then criticise bollywood (sarcasm)<br>Well what else to say , idiots !!
I haven’t watched most of these films apart from one 2 ka 4 and few scenes of shadi karke whatever. I knew both these films are problematic AF when I watched them in 2000s. Juhi Chawla was a goddamn cop in the movie yet being abused like this made no sense. I mean why couldn’t she stand up for herself? her comedy liners were annoying especially when she was being wronged by Srk’s character.
Maja nahi aay bhai
Dont blame 90&#39;s , if it gives these movies they also gave you movie like Dhamini
And now these fabricated practices in movies have long before and are still persuading dumbasses to act like creepy stalkers or sadistic bastards thinking that there is nothing wrong with it.
Woh last scene, english wala, kaunsi movie se hai?
<b>This is disgusting</b><br>Unfortunately, Bollywood is still like this (mostly) with the exceptions of a few awesome movies!
Why did these heroines shoot for such scenes. From the recent ones, you can watch Besharam where Ranbir Kapoor chases the woman till she gives in. What the heck. Thankfully it&#39;s starting to change. Only starting to.
Fun video.  Thanks. Since the video is in English, you could subtitle the Hindi parts.
😂😂😂😂😂
Why u r sooo feminist?
I really became dumber watching these horrifying scenes.
5.03 is  what they call &quot;&quot;&quot; din me taare dikha?&quot;&quot;&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>KYA chata tha bhai
Totally agree with you desi culture and bollywood needs to stop promoting domestic violence and harassment.
Amazing channel
Do kano ke beech bhoosa bhara hai 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 bilkul sahi kaha
Wow man i feel really glad atleast someone noticed all these disgusting things
Pls make a video on paid/chatukar/lapdog media. Pls pls plssss
Thats really uncomfortable to watch tahnk you for pointing out
Ur voice is so amazing
The alcohol was consumed by Salman first.
Salmans slap with Shilpa makes me wonder poor aish took that in real life.<br>Thank god she moved on n didn’t accept it just coz he was a star
I have become more idiotic after watching all this garbage 🙈<br>Good work though !!
Talking about &#39;phool aur kantey&#39;, just don&#39;t forget that embarrassing molestation-story of a song &#39;mere college ki ek ladki hai&#39;. The song is a disgraceful display of what used to be regarded as the idea of &#39;courting&#39; (a girl) back then. It consists of men sleazily looking at the lead female actor who is publicly molested, chased, dragged, groped and in essence sexually harassed by the male lead, ending with the latter shoving her against a wall and trying to force himself on her. It is shameful and disgraceful to watch.
Salman Khan ka chaata jabardast tha...and Ur reaction during the video jammy was awesome 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣cudnt control laughing
Ek video paid critics par banao,<br>Jinki wajah se good movies flop ho jati
Boring
Your content is simply amazing
Have you forgotten that women abuse was the norm not only in India but also western countries!! Just saying!!
What music is this😍😍
There&#39;s this movie GEET GANGA. There&#39;s a scene where a woman gets bitten by a snake and the actor takes out a musical instrument to call out another snake to suck the venom out of the woman who was bitten by the snake.... Maaatlab... Kuchbhi...
Meko toh tu chutiya laga
MEH....BOOB tere MEH.....BOOB
I really don&#39;t like his video rather than talking about a seen u talked about the full story of movies...really bad
Sanam bewafa still remains the most idiotic movie I&#39;ve ever come across
No offense, but this literally ruined my day
This guy is so obsessed at sounding westernised he tries too hard to find faux feminist issues to display his fake progressive attitudes
And also the movie &quot;raja ki aayegi baarat&quot; where a girl was forced to marry her own rapist
Pick any random movie and you find insult for women. Name a single movie where there is normal treatment for women.
Can you put English caption on your videos pleaseeeee 🥺
Can you do a review on the old movie gharwali bahawali
After watching this video i just smashed the subscribe button ...
Oh wow... yaha log in sab chizoo ko samne dekhte he...aur agar women us pe koi complaint krti he... wo has ke chod denge seriously nahi lenge.. and you are really brave to call out upon such things.. kisi ne toh women empowerment ke bare me sochna hi chaiye
shaadi karke fas gaya, this movie is seriously disgusting
salman&#39;s  rapta was jhakash...oh my oh my oh my....tumhe maar hi khaana hai na..toh le kha.....LOLZZZZZZZZZZ
I want your opinion in Koffee with Karen and it&#39;s new award nonsense
The last part tho..! 🤣🤣
Phool n kante wala sabse sahi h it would be terrifyng fr ny women
This guy is making videos from 2080
All the old movies actually made it so that hitting someone or sexual harassment was alright that you should just take it, cry and live on.....  It is highly shameful that these kinds of stupid movies were made
Agreed. This kinda stuff are responsible for the abusive approach of the males . Disgusting it is.
Omg!!!
These movies are the reason why 90s kids are so fucked up especially the guys coming from small town.
Your voice is just wow....... M
Even shakti kapoor😂
&quot;Raja ki aaegi baarat&quot; movie.. in which guy rapes the girl but instead of punishing him court orders him to marry the girl.. mtlb kuch bhi😝
Great idea man 👍
&quot;Even Shakti Kapoor&quot;
When will someone dare to speak about the politics that goes behind the scenes( pun intended) while choosing majority of the scripts for movies ?? <br>    Frankly I’m not surprised at all at the kind of images women are portrayed in. <br>    Also when will someone dare to speak on the incorrect portrayal of minorities in Bollywood movies ever since 1947 ??
You are such a snowflake, dont you. Those are just a movies.
People should watch movies like 96, fire, or mouna ragam. They talk about real issues.
This channel stop growing 😁
I agree with all you said. And these are just the tip of the iceberg. I could not believe what I was watching when I watched the piece of crap called Ganga Jamuna Saraswati. Meenakshi shashadri gets wet and faints from cold. Of course Amitabh Bachchan HAS to give her body warmth. OK.... now I don&#39;t understand how does giving body warmth translate to F***ing an unconscious woman and impregnating her. I am aghast that &quot;educated&quot; actors like Amitabh and Meenakshi never raised an objection about glorifying Statutory rape. The absolute cringe was the scene where rain tears away at the spider&#39;s web signifying the act being performed. SERIOUS therapy is needed for directors who conceive such scenes.
Abuse against women physical or verbal should be completely stopped. it&#39;s even worse to see top stars like salman and sharukh hit women! South Indian films are the worst, there women are made fun of because they are not fair or fat! We need to boycott such portrayal
Boring
Itna female ke liye dikhata hai tu kya karta hain bhai to strengthen them
Saale tuje kabhi Hollywood fiction main ye SAB Kyun nahi dikhta...
The way u discribe these scenes is so logical and too the point. Love to watch ur videos Anmol Jamwal ♥ love your voice
i am not trying to justify all the male characters who hit women in movies but i think Salman slapping Shilpa in Shaadi Karke Phaas Gaya was justified. She embarrassed him by revealing their personal life in front of so many people. She also teases him by calling him &quot;momma&#39;s boy&quot; and she also instigates him to hit her.
If nothing, we Indians are great at portraying sexist tropes in movies.
The end was epic.
Bro, ur channel is just getting better each time with research and the timing. Good video.
Phodoing their matkas 🤣🤣🤣🤣
There&#39;s one movie Salma peh Dil ah Gaya. It is so stupid that there is even a talking camel.
A+ narration. i&#39;m not kidding- I don&#39;t live in india but w current news headlines i&#39;ve had 0 hope for resident indian self aware men uptil now. I love this and your thought process has me in tears!! thank you. you&#39;re incredible
Most of the regional films also have the same portrayal of women depicting them as strength less rape targets who is destined to fall in love and marry a guy who saves her
MATLAB KUCH BHIIII 😂😂
Pls make a video on the movie Deshdrohi by the legendary actor KRK😂😂... It&#39;s my humble request Pls 🙏🙏
true!
I liked the way you have explained things...
🤣calm down brother.. physical absuses aren&#39;t promoted in any of the movies....where are you guys if any movie a girl slaps a guy or something its just a movie...think about it in that way ..if you go on to look for different angles in movies..no ones are safe
phodoing matkaas🤣🤣🤣
Agree dear
I would have slapped him back😤😄👋🏻 ( Shahrukh Khan part)
Dhaai akshar prem ke how about this one? I couldn’t watch it after half an hours. Some brainless git wrote this script 🤮
😂🤣
Abhi tak Mic change nahi kiya bhaiya??????
Lol 🤣

I loved your videos title track....which is it BTW
You are doing a great service to point these out as it has become a commonplace to tolerate violence against women. What if the abused was not a woman or related.  The abuser would have their ass kicked and put in jail for assault.
bhai jamana vaisa to movie bhi vaisi hi hogi na .... vaise kuch log abhi bhi badle nahi he btw
Bro please make video on Satya and Sacred Games..
Even shakti Kapoor 😂
Do this video again but with more recent movies... In the last 4 5 yrs... Don&#39;t shy if the Khan movies are there too
Bhai tereko aisehi larki mil jayegi... Itna zyada feminist mat ban. 😂😂
ye sali attitude wali aurat jhapad  khane ke liye hi bani hai
Biggest WTF moment for me from the 1999 Ajay Devgan and Arshad Warsi film hogi pyarr ki jeet when in the one film&#39;s song Arshad Warsi kiss a girl forcefully by locking down her hands.
slapping across the face SPECIALLY the OPPOSITE SEX is never the solution ???? When will it be okay to just say &quot; slapping across the face is never the solution&quot;. Violence against men and transgenders is equally appalling.
I must say, one of the best videos of your channel... Such a heartfelt genuine truth you have discussed about. Its shameful the way man - woman relationship, love is portrayed &amp; fed to audience through films. And I personally think south Indian movies are as prevalent with toxic masculinity &amp; sexism as Bollywood if not more so!!<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23saluteyou">#saluteyou</a>
Bhai video ko hindi me bnao.. channel aur badhega...i think so
I loved it
Actually I did not quite buy your inclusion of One two ka four Coz then that would lead to 95% movies being flagged like that.  That was more to do with the situation per say and how she sought to take this another route. Agreed she was no damsel in distress
Salman performed that stunt many times in real life also 🤣🤣
Chup tuchiye
Was waiting for this list,  every time I try to watch an old movie,  the sexist dialogue makes me stop watching
I think One two ka four can be given benefit of doubt here. If I remember the story correctly, Juhi Chawla was an undercover cop. This would explain why she didn&#39;t react appropriately to the slap. She wanted to stay undercover and hence acted the way some ordinary Indian woman from 90s would react in the situation.
Shola Shabnam - Govinda and friends sneak in the hostel and put false lipstick marks in oorder to get actually kissed by the girls. and the warden orders them to do so
Salman Khan scene was so disgusting 😒😒
Amol, using hindi phrases in between to express your emotions feels a bit awkward and weird. Please try sticking to english.
Logic is nowhere in some stupid old films, they say it’s okay to eve teese, which reflects on society so every copies that if there hero can do it why not them, let not forget these actors million dollars worth campaigns to promote so the fans will be attracted to them so why won’t people copy movie scenes and violence on women, drinking alcohol, smoking, eveteesing girls,
Found the reason why Salman is single still
It was very difficult to believe that salman khan even decide to do something like this. That slap was heard through out the slaposphere 😂. If it was for real ... she would be flying for several seconds in the air. The intensity was unbelievable!! God save bollywood!!
Looking older movies with today&#39;s lens of morality ?<br>10 years pehle tak bhi itne woke nahi hue the log and then if you&#39;re going to judge 90s and 80s film, an era where those were the norms in the society, we&#39;re going to cringe for sure

I love your videos but dont you think you have already done a few videos aboit regressive and dumb scenes. We all want some new concept Jammy. Its just a constructive remark. Love✌️✌️
why are there not a couple more million subscribers on this channel
Aaj feminism jaga he bhai ke andar :)
I have an issue and if it makes me considered alpha- male i dont care.<br>Its not about girl drinking or even getting smashed. But its about in that state insulting her husband in front of everyone in a condescending manner.<br>It applies visa versa also. Slapping is a bit much but i l give the guy or girl discount as emotional abuse and character assasination r much more than physical abuse in form of a slap.
1900&#39;s era was kinda crazy
bhai ye saara reasearch krte wqt...u must have gone through serious trauma
Kudos to you for bringing awesome content.. And immaculate language!
It explains cool things in a boring way
I actually judged the audience...being ok...! after watching such content 😒
It&#39;s actually been a mindset in Indian women that beaten up by their husbands acceptable .. I mean it was ok to me like <b>ye to hota hi h</b> and maybe somewhere it&#39;s a fault of our parents more than the society..
Total feminist video.<br>There are many more insane things done by Bollywood.<br>Recently they showed Jhansi ki Rani doing item song in Manikarnika.<br>Plz make a video on the other insane  aspects in the Bollywood films too
Make a video on Double meaning bollywood songs
Fuck you
That Salman slap literally scared me. I dont think i can watch it again.
bole to jhakaaas tha Jammy ! Thanks. And, you forgot to include that one where &quot; the people of the society try to  convince the rapist to marry the same girl as the solution/punishment for this crime(rape)....and surprisingly girl is found very happy in such moments in all those movie&quot;
Salman&#39;s slap is heard across the universe.
Chal na khuch bhi Bana raha hai
You sounds like Salil jamdar 🤔
😂
Lagta ha  censor board na ganja pee ka pass ki ha movie .

English me nahi...<br>  Hindi me
Hindi me bolo bhai
Film ke main actor hain....hero hai...esliy koi kuch thodi bolega....kyuki hero hai voh
I want to add one thing that women in the movies were so weak n helpless that they can&#39;t oppose anything going wrong against them if a girl is raped then she will commit sucide, or after every messup she will forgive n forget everything and consider her husband as devta . This is why every man takes every woman for granted,n  sadly this is the mirror of our society .
Boring ....please dont upload such filth .. yeh sab baaton ka pattangadh banana jaisa hai

Please speak in hindi. .
how can u get so much time of creating a video on movie that too such an idiotic topic. Well I am myself an idiot for watching and commenting on it.
I&#39;m speechless without watching
I have a question when the fuck we will raise above Love story Shit
Ye kya h yrr hindi movie ke scene ko tum english me describe kr rhe??? Wtf🤔🤔
I have seen One two ka four couple of times and the scene which you quoted here SRK didn&#39;t beat Juhi as she was her love interest but he behaved like cop who used this to get the truth...and reaction of Juhi was also not of a lover who was planning to marry him but she was also undercover cop who was acting in front of him by behaving like illiterate...so your logic is not for here....Thank You

Arre chuu.... One 2 ka 4 mein juhi undercover thi tab tak naa?? Toh woh aggressive nhi ho sakti thi...
I agree with the sexual harassment part but in one 2 ka 4 Juhi’s character was a CBI agent disguised as a maid so she couldn’t whack him back and had to act so that her cover could be safe.This is just my opinion in no I support sexual harassment.🙏🏽✌🏽
Really liked the video....thanks for posting it.
He should do the following video <br><br>1. Worst make up on female<br>2. Worst makeup on male(Ajay Devgan is a big lol)<br>3. Actors/actress favorite songs that broke records <br>..there is other but I&#39;m going to watch this video..lol
This jammy pants guy has no other work. He just want to talk about only women issues in every video
After watching that movie.. no one was ready to marry nashedi sallu Bhai..

Good one 👍🏻 . Another disgusting movie was srk / madhuri/Salman’s hum tumhare hain sanam.. you can make a whole episode about do’s and dont’s that a married man, woman and friend should follow 😂
You should watch... Mahnga dulha sasti dulhan... Extremely hilarious cz of its illogical events
and making of such .. nonsense video is more annoying then the old film clips shown here... what do you want to say..?? this video also doesn&#39;t have logic... 😀😀.. why you don&#39;t read disclaimer... wala clip... 😂😂.. and apart from that.. the thing you want to explain .. is felt by everyone.. people ignores.  these things like.. ye film hai.. thoda entertaining to rahega hi.. like.. but.. you didn&#39;t find any topic and.. displayed this.. disgusting...
Ranja tharki tha
Most of the south indian films are still following that similar MO. <br>When hero saw the heroine he will be like &#39;aww... &#39; (a song)..he stalks her(a song).. at the later part of that song she will be impressed with all that stalking and falls in love.. (a song).. something happens after that and they bcme sad (a song)..<br>A big fight scene and they are happily married thereaftr.. THE END
Analysis of movie &#39;Whats your Rashee? &#39; and Dahej thing in movie..
You should do an episode on the movie hawa... now that is kuch bi
What about hero no 1?? N many of Govinda&#39;s movie where he constantly tell her actress or female co stars that their short dresses was the reason behind molestation. <br>Biwi no 1 : this whole movie is disgusting. A man fools both his wife n gf. But hats off to the director, story writer. Wife - sati savitri , gf - modern ambitious women , husband - innocent guy who just got spell bounded by his gf.
Bro ur video suck. Seriously big time!
Pls don&#39;t be feminist
Matlab kuch bhi.....🤣🤣🤣🤣
How many replayed the Salman khan slap scene?
Is this guy gay or something
Movies like this makes psyco-creepy-stalkers
Last one was gazab
Truly sad. But glad that some people like your channel recognise &amp; acknowledge these facts and present it out to the now-evolving generation. Thanks to our new generation of wise people like you. I sometimes really appreciate your content and wisdom.
there are several films these days which stereotype men ...do you have the courage to make an episode on that ...dont sell victimhood in the name of gender ...i expected more sense from this channel....i know whats coming in future ....some distasteful feminist rants ....so i am unsubscribing ...Best of Luck
But, but, but, wasn&#39;t Juhi an undercover cop faking her OTT personality of a loud &quot;jai mata di saab ji&quot; act to avoid suspicion, who ultimately did a u- turn for her job &amp; let SRK suffer, or something to that extent?????<br><br>Context is everything. She wasn&#39;t some &#39;Abla naari&#39;. Her every line was playing to the gallery. That scene was no different, hena?
Your voice is so beautiful n its so serious n funny too
Quite deep observations... Yeah most of 90&#39;s movies were really bullshit...
Salman Khan was thinking of Vivek Oberoi while slapping Shilpa Shetty
How do you even watch these movies.!?
This video selection is very stupid and uncalled for because you are picking dumb movies from a generation when gender inequality did exist. We all know this and have aged past that.<br>You are looking at past from the eyes of today, that’s not justified.<br>And most importantly, What is ur point?<br>How about spanking and BDSM in 50Shades?  ... is it love/ disrespect/ Juhi getting more attracted to SRK after a tight slap.
Please change this irritating intro.
Is this the reason why rape is prevalent in our country? Because bollywood OKed it, and made up stupid reasons to justify it, like that line of lion and goat?
That salman scene i died laughing ghoom ke thapada
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=303">5:03</a>.. after the scene..<br><br>Shilpa shetty : I want back my incisor teeth....🤕🤕😂😂
What i really like about u is  how support women and modesty of a girl.....i luv ur heart....
Wait ranbir Kapoor approached deepika in tamasha  and didn&#39;t arised  being in same proximity or group .<br>Also , who are you to determine that relationship should only be happening between ppl in same group ???!!!<br>Not defending the movie ,but its like you pointed out one flaw to  make a new flaw .
Salman should&#39;ve won best slap of the year award 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don&#39;t know why but I&#39;ve got addicted to this channel 😍😅
Holy shit Nach kar maar raha hai Salman....
The weird thing is mom was watching this salman&#39;s movie and forced me to watch it with her at the slap&#39;s I wanted to throw up 😂😂😂😂
Karunesh Talwar?
I really salute you for the fact u don&#39;t support violence or disrespect towards a woman.
Salman&#39;s slap was really hard
U should collaborate with only desi channel
This guy is a fucking feminist...
It’s no wonder Indians are so fucked up. I mean just look at the absurdity portrayed in your films
There are more. Please talk about those as well. Anyway, thank you very much for this one!
@triedandrefusedproductions please mk a video on worstt choreography in bollywood
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5eslav82Co">https://youtu.be/K5eslav82Co</a>
YOU ARE MODERN SMART BROTHER😑😑😑.............
Yaar, pls make one episode of the list of best horror movies in bollywood
Raise your hand if you see his videos just to learn some new English words
It was just painful to even watch these , I wish I have resources to sue all these ppl।
Bhai why don’t you make one video on DevD...amazing movie with superb direction and cinematography...just a advice..a big fan of your videos and Bollywood 😊
Too repetitive
Please make video on top 10 movies love by audience but hated by critics
&quot;even Shakti Kapoor&quot;😂😂😂😂
Glad you realize these things. Sometimes these things make me wonder if others even realize it 🤔🤔
Awesome
Ranjha ne dupatta khich liya 🤣🤣
That Salman Khan scene. .whack WTF 😕😕😤
Kitna bakte ho yaar !! Itna kuch samajhte ho but itna sa samajh me nehi ata k ye sab movies 90&#39;s ka hai and that time those situations were realities ... U can&#39;t judge these clips now ...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=108">1:48</a> wait whaaattttttttt!!!!!
Your videos are always nice but I&#39;m honestly obsessed with your &#39;matlab kuch bhi hai&#39; episodes 😍 Please try to make these types of videos more often, n your Hindi in between is always the treat to our ears 💙
You made us dumber lol 😂
not a fan of srk..but u do know that juhi chawla was playing an undercover cop in one two k four ryt? maybe dats y she reacted that way
Thanks for this video and your content which looks at important issues within films. I am happy that a guy is doing this cos if a woman was talking about regressive/rapey scenes, she would get so badly trolled, called a feminazi, fat, ugly and triggered in the comment section.
what film clip did you use at the end please say ?? that every one in the room is dumber clip
What about main stream movies..you should mention akshaye khanna stalking aishwarya in taal..shahrukh being a dick in kkhh..the whole family being regressive in hum aapke hain kaun..etc etc etc.. you seem to shy away from mentioning popular movies and block busters which in retrospect were horrid
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=252">4:12</a><br>Who is in background poster?<br>Hardy Sandhu???<br>😂😂😂
That last scene konse hollywood movie ka tha?
I think you overreact at some scenes
Salute this guy
I respect you for speaking against these movies keep it up
Phorowing matkas .. 😂🤣 epic
Do you want to see whole Ku6 bhi movie?<br>Watch &quot;prem quaidi&quot; it&#39;s hilarious 😂
Haawwww... Shaadi Karke Phas Gaye.. Seriously?
Bro i love your videos.. i would love it if you do a review of a movie called seshnaag... I found i obnoxious and cringeworthy.. a multistarer movie having actors like rekha danny jitender and rishi kapoor... Just see it and i am sure you cant help yourself from saying &quot;matlab kuch bhi&quot; .. the most funny thing is danny screaming &quot;shamshan ghat ke murde&quot; every 5 secs.. please watch it .  😂
didn&#39;t even see the vid yet, already know my boi gonna say matlab Kuch bhiiiiiii
U ve begun sounding like a  pro feminist. Stop showing repetitive content
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=302">5:02</a> and Reigns with a superman punch
Salman actually practiced that slap many times on Aishwariya.
I think Shilpa was actually slapped.
Please don&#39;t quote females as Opposite sex........... During Shadi karke phas Gaya yaar
The argument for the regressive portrayal used to be this is how Indians think, (not true) and this mindset has not changed all that much. On the argument of showing adult content in U/A films is that kids these days know everything because of Youtube. And I don&#39;t mean censorship, just wrong content targeted at wrong audience.
Except shilpa shetty bit everything is ok salman did not slap her for drinking he slapped for insulting his mother and  his family if anyone scolds your mother in front of you how will you react if you see the whole film you will understand MR.Kuchbhi please make sensible videos and alchohal is ingurious to human beings whether men or women so stop supporting girls drinking alchohal and smoking in the name of feminism
Whaaatt!! Thats it huh. I bet the youtube and the copyright issues are not in the way u could easily make a 6 hours 43 minutes video on this topic from only the 90&#39;s. MATLAB SACHME
I love that &quot;MATLAB KUCH BHI&quot; <br>I too say that very often 😂😂😂✌️<br>Great vid tho ❤️❤️❤️😎👍
Waiting on that &quot;Matlab Kuch Bhi&quot; Merch!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=376">6:16</a> which movie/series?
Last one was legit.. try to think by his character&#39;s perspective. Why would a vileness character speak socially ethical dialogue? And about rest of them, scenes were so dumb that i forgot about them. But yeah that slap was hardcore and hilarious. Though I never watched that movie.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=303">5:03</a>
People who watch old Bollywood movies need to watch your videos.<br>Somehow it was okay to be violent in the 90&#39;s but now, I am grateful that mindset has changed
Salman Khan &#39;s production movie &quot;NOTEBOOK&quot; is coming. I saw it&#39;s trailer &amp; it&#39;s just a garbage then I thought how 90&#39;s audience are make him great  actor . he knows nothing about acting man
Stop ridiculing old movies.
When salman slapped shilpa I was like wtf man.....
You English language only understand you self
&quot;EVEN SHAKTI KAPOOR&quot; - DEAD 😂😂😂
Maza nh aaya ... You are very selective and feminist..
Shilpa ko bhut bura mara.
Your voice ❤️
What&#39;s crazy is you actually spend time watching these films....mad respect
fodoing their matkas 😂😂😂 Bhai teri english ko kya hua 😂😂😂
Your channel should be called &quot;Matlab Kuch Bhi&quot; 😅😅😂😂🤣🤣
I was waiting for your review on total dhamal
<b>Even Shakti Kapoor</b>
No subtitle fuck you @jammypants
U forgot sonu nigam dialogue from the very famous film &quot;jani dushman&quot;.. 😂..the scene in which he was trying  to convince manisha koirala as to why she should forgive the boys who had attempted to rape her . I guess no scene be worse than this.....
hfh
Bro u need to start watching art films or docu-dramas if you are looking for realistic portrayals.  This is INDIAN MASALA cinema so these things are expected and should be left behind in the cinemas and forgotten, not studied.
In 90s Eveteasers were considered heroes and following and teasing girls were considered romantic and heroic.And see what it led our country to.
If someone is insulting you and your family in front of everyone even after you try so much to calm her down hitting is never the answer. you gotta get on your knees and beg until she calms down. Progressive
Last wala defines this video, likee kuchh bhiii🤣🤣
Podhow-ing their Matkas! LOLLLL
Why don&#39;t you make a video on movie scenes where women were being properly portrayed in the context of Love, Respect etc. consider including more Older movies, instead of the same old Embarrassing or Kuch Bhi videos... Because I&#39;m hell curious to see such scenes.
Gunda a cult classic
Please make videos about Indian series too.
1 2 ka 4 movie was fine..
SKKPY it can happen cuz 1st she is drunk and 2nd she spoke against his mother.. he could not stop her by his words cuz she is not ready to talk.. any man can relate to it..
Phool aur kante scene is some what ok as eighties and nineties women were having mostly traditional and conservative mentality even in cosmopolitan Indian cities and men are allowed to have an upper hand and chavanism. Women used to love to be stalked and proposed by macho men. The movie clearly represented the societal mindset of the period as education and financial independence were just catching up with no corporate boom or activism of feminist and liberals . You can&#39;t compare it with today.
Seriously you dnt have much content so show now , isliye you pin pointing every single scene which is against the society according to &quot;you&quot; ..  You cnt label a guy as a womanizer if he hit a women only once and that too when he really angry , in all these movie there much love shown toward there opposite love interest, but nahi ek mara mara toh sala ladka hi badmann h , bhale ladki kuch b bole , he have to listen it , either its against him or his family or moral values , your content is more like &quot;Matlab kuch bhi &quot;
Bhai background score change kardo, it has become really old, at least 2-3 tracks circulate karte raho.
our more shots please
I liked how you used Slapping someone of &#39;opposite sex&#39; is not the option, rather than saying slapping a &#39;woman&#39;.
Bollywood always sucks
<b>Bharo Maang Meri Bharo</b>
Jammy a.k.a Anmol Jamval please check your instagram DM i have recommended one very good movie which i want you to see... Please
You are brilliant, man.
These films have portrayed women as an object. Movies has the responsibility to make changes in the society. I am glad that a change is coming in positive direction  in film industry towards the depiction of women.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrRm6uANr8s">https://youtu.be/IrRm6uANr8s</a> For those people who think Salman khan&#39;s character was wrong to hit Shilpa shetty&#39;s character , just watch this scene and without being biased comment on it. In this scene Salman Khan is trying to reason with her but she is provoking him by being physical with him herself. She deserved to be hit. Sorry to say this but tried and refused productions got it all wrong in this point. A channel should be unbiased towards every gender. I like this channel but don&#39;t show any bullshit.

You Know This Is No Doubt Actual Reason Why In Our Country Crimes About Womens Are Increasing!!!!!!!!These Criminals Will Get Certain Influences From These Movies &amp; They Will Try Same With A Sweet &amp; Innocent Girls For No Reason!!!!!!<br>1.That Scene Of Salman Khan Has Reminded One Of His Incidents Of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan When He Slaps Her Like That Painfully!!!!!!!!!<br>2.After Seeing Painful Scene Of One Two Ka Four I Seriously Now Start Thinking About Comment Of Shahrukh Khan Where He Has To Say That He Resepct Womans!!!!!!!
Seriously man! Bollywood was horrendous, disgusting, cheap and irritation back then and after much improvement now is still bad.
Wow Jammy Truly It Was An Quite Entertaining &amp; Thought Provoking Video This Was!!!!!!!Also Your Intro Was Not That Bad At All Because Actually Its Quite Enjoyable!!!!!!!!So Screw To Those Peoples Who Has Complained About Your Language That You Used In Your Videos!!!!!!!!No Matter What I Will Always Take Your Stand Right!!!!!!!Your Vidoes Are Actually Help Me A Lot For Understanding The Real Cinema!!!!!Keep It Up &amp; All The Best!!!!!!!!Now Make A Video About Movie Total Dhamaal Which Has So Many MKB Moments!!!!!!!See You On The Next Videos Of Movie Reviews Of Luka Chuppi &amp; Sonchiriya Tomorrow!!!!!!
I have two issues regarding the Salman Khan slap scene. 1. I have no issue with Alcohol but what according to you should be the punishment for a wife who is abusing her husband and in laws in public. 2. There are countless scenes in Hindi cinema where the girl slaps the boy. What about that.    My dear friend, in India feminism has been taken over by feminazi. U should know that while there are no. of laws under which a man and his entire familycan be booked on grounds of mere complaint of  hitting his wife, there is no law under which a woman can b prosecuted if she physically abuses her husband or in laws. Time to get the other face of blind feminism through the eyes of victim husbands.
Bhusa between their legs 😂🤣😂🤣
I always like your movie reviews but I am just placing and opinion you only showed slaps given by male actors to females, there are many absurd scenes in which the opposite is going on. Just a thought as you said slapping the opposite sex is not the solution
Bollywood is quite the reason for many vices existing in society which people do not realise is actually harrassment.
This guy is die hard supporter of women&#39;s rights.  That&#39;s okay, but that&#39;s pretty much all he has to say in every video for criticising a scene. Dude,  there is a world beyond women&#39;s rights explore that too.
People who dislike your videos<br><b>Me (waiting for this video whole month): &quot;Acha matlab kuch bhi&quot;</b>
सर आपके वीडियो तो बहुत अच्छे होते हैं लेकिन या तो आप पूरा वीडियो हिंदी में बनाएं या फिर पूरा वीडियो इंग्लिश में बनाएं आप कुछ हिंदी में बोलते हैं और कुछ इंग्लिश में ऐसा क्यों वैसे तो मैं यह चाहता हूं कि आप सभी वीडियो हिंदी में बनाएं क्योंकि मुझे तो भाई इंग्लिश समझने में बहुत अधिक प्रॉब्लम होती है हालांकि जितनी भी समझ पाता हूं तो ठीक है लेकिन बस मैं यही चाहूंगा कि आगे से आप यदि संभव हो सके तो हिंदी में वीडियोस बनाएं
sir meri englesh utni acchi nahi hai, pls thor hindi me bat kiya kariye
No wonder people keep writing their lovers name on Historic Monuments😪
Dude you have got to review this fairly recent film Shaapit (2010)!
I love your voice
That salman khan&#39;s slapping part was a liberal ideology. I mean liberals confront in that way but conservative Indians won&#39;t accept it
Matlab kuch bhi ...👌👌👍
Playing 4th one on loop 😂

Salman Khan doing a movie like that isn&#39;t something new for us.....he does that in almost every movie..🙄
This guy is so awesome! He inspired me to follow what i want! I have started my YouTube channel too! I hope you’ll like my first video! Do not forget to subscribe me! Thank you!!
Please make video on super star Rajnikanth entry
Thanks..<br>I liked the movie one 2 ka four.. but the slap scene and encouragement of such psychotic behavior by the victim (which is heroine ) is disgusting.<br>But, I rather forgot the scene or may  I have nonsense sense when I&#39;ve seen the movie, thank you for let me know what i&#39;ve liked so many years.<br><br><br><br>And when salman character slap Shilpa... It&#39;s wrong but, gosh ! Wish we  could bash the wrong people like this...
Hahaha haha.... Salman
That&#39;s why sir i love u r videos. At last on last day of Feb we got, &quot;Mat Lab Kuch Bhi&quot;. Thank u Bro!!
Damn.. Scenes like these create mindset among the indians. And when the film industry portrays such acts as heroic, the normal people tend to do it more. Thanks for the video.
MATLAB kuch bhi
Respects your thoughts about women
The end 😂👌
Shadi karke phas gaya yaar is the most misogynistic, regressive and opinionated movie against women done by A list  actors

I love ur intro💕
O ho... So your funding is now known,.. from the international female supremacy pusher groups from US and other first world countries the create gender gap as mass control tactics.
Hahahahaha fodoing their matakas!! Straight from Indian mythology aur kya karenge yeh log
Why don&#39;t you make a video on horror movies. E.g. best or worst.. something like that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhpPWrdrMo&amp;t=274">4:34</a> even Shakti Kapoor 😂😂😂😂
Fuck you. You like modern love stories where they fuck and break up and many humans love old types of movies.
These movies still exist and they say that porn ban kar do aur molestation band ho jayega........matlab kuchhhhhh bhi
Eh, just a little spoiler: Juhi Chawla&#39;s character is a spy in One Two ka Four. She had to stay around SRK&#39;s character, she couldn&#39;t just leave citing that the man misbehaved with her. But yeah, they could have given her a better response.
Oh My God shaadi kar ke phas gaya.... Thank god i didn&#39;t  watch that non sense ...
Yaar aap hamesha bas movies mein ladkiyon ke uper bura hone per video banatye kya kbi aisi koi movie bhi banaogye jisme ladki ne ladke ke sath pura kiya, yaar mtlb aisi bhi movies hongi

I can&#39;t tell how many movies when I watch now is so sexiest and misogynistic that I really can&#39;t watch them anymore....but the sad part is it did not felt like it then cause it is so acceptable in our society.... I hate it..
Both the slap scenes were well deserved by women<br><br>We ahould not DISCRIMINATE between man and woman while slapping for someone&#39;s unpardonable behavior else it might amount to discrimination between sexes and will ultimately lead to INEQUALITY.. which is wrong...right?? <br><br>To all those moronic women who deman equal rights and equal pay<br><br>1st learn to bear equal consequences and take corresponding risks as men ..
Salute you for watching all these movies for making this type of videos 😁
Man your trying to find too much logic in a non sense like Bollywood😋
Well even today movies are regressive for example cocktail... I mean c&#39;mon the guy himself can do anything but when it comes to falling in love with a girl she has to be virgin and the girl who can be taken to mom. Deepika is shown to be a nice kind hearted very caring and very beautiful girl but then she is not the priority cos she is not good on some regressive standards. Infact there is a whole list of movies like this and regressive directors like Bhansali who made Padmavat to glorify a tradition we are ashamed of.
Whole nation talking about india vs Pakistan <br> Band karo Bhai thodi din .
Even if you are correct but then you are comparing two different generations altogether. The kind of awareness and naturalness we have in our cinema right now, it didnt exist some 25-30 years ago. Filmmakers and writers are much more educated than they used to be. I don&#39;t think the same directors who made such awful movies in the past probably arent active any more.
Hahaha are bc salman khan ka thappad haha bc chutya hi the ye bhi bhai...
Even shakti kPoor
We have come a long way.
Do you think films of today would have been box office hit in dos time.  Everything is ok in its era. Who knows films of dis decade wud b laughing material in sum other decade<br>By d way thanks for entertaining.
Salman was just portraying himself :/
Its good to see that open minded people like you exist in this era.. this is reflected by the kind of videos you make highlighting and understanding women&#39;s degrading position in the society.  Keep up the good work sir!
Bollywood is s hit
&quot;Even Shakti Kapoor&quot;
Insanely idiotic, no doubt our generation is still struggling to accept sociental norms around consent, gender equality and women empowerment
Bhai apna intro chota or baad me kar
Ya and that destroyed the mentality of youth at that time....
Salman hitting Shilpa aggressively in a sequence surprised you?<br>Surely in all these years you might have been in a state of denial or having a selective amnesia for a douchebag like Salman Khan.
Just make a video on 1. The most emotionally moving scenes 2. The best cinematic scenes 3. Top 10 best direction 4. Top 10 best acting moments in Bollywood..
Olwz waiting for your zero logic videos..

It&#39;s sheer waste of time and ur effort to remind these forgettably bizarre scenes which audience have already forgotten.

How creepy things like this was ok in bollywood
The 90s have so many senseless, no logic movies that u wonder how the actors themselves agreed for such kinda roles..
fodoing their matkas, most of those women have bhoosa... Matlab kuch bhi hahahahahaha
Woh daur chutiyo bhara tha 90&#39;s

Tum Baat toh Bilkul sahi kar rahe ho ! Lekin Uss Time Movies se inspired hoke Reality me bhi aisa hi hota ! Aur Ab Bohot Sahi ho raha hai ki Aurte bhi Muh Tod Chaata deti hai. Pehle Woh Sehem ke rehti thi Lekin Ab nahi .
Even &quot;Dil se&quot; is also irritating movie I fell. Srk is forcing and irritating Monisha koirala all the time!!
The ‘Matlab Kuch Bhi’ merch is on the way
Shadhi kar ke phas ga Salman khan&#39;s worst movie ....this movie is so bad 🙈 same 12 ka 4
Yaar this was really &quot;kuch bhi&quot;. Brother Sexual Haressment had got other defination in that era. You r looking these things under today&#39;s defination,<br>Sorry cant watch the ful episode. Otherwise i like to watch ur videos.
Bandhan.<br>सल्मान इसका कुछ सेवा भाव karo
Yes your intro is to long it kills the suspense
You were right about all tge scenes but i think lets just get to real equality thing. It is not good to slap anyone whether a girl or a boy by a girl or a boy. But it is equally insane to drink abd get abusive for someone to that extent k bhai bande ki jann hi le li sirf bato se. Your words can also kill someone if it hurts his/her heart specially if you are his/her most loved one. When such an insult, abuse disrespect happens people loose their calm whether it is a girl or boy.. In shadi krke fas gya yar shilpa shetty character was that wrong egoistic idiotic that what her husband character did was correct it could be her own brother, mother or father. Just dont take it like this k male gender ne female gender ko mara. Glt ka oppose hi kia.<br>Equality means glti or uski punishment boys girls k liye same hi hona chaiye agr is scene me character ulte hote mtlb shilpa slap her husband to ye mtlb kuch b me nhi aata. H na
One 2 ka 4 Fatima sana sheikh act as a child artist with SRK so it&#39;s ok she acts Amir khan daughter in dangal but not ok when she acted his love interest 😑
I have been raised in a place where  the so called 90&#39;s hit are celebrated like anything. All my life I never had a fond for these movies and thought that I was just different after watching these videos I realised I am not different but I rational and logical. Thanks you so much for making me realise that there are a lot of people who think the same.
Liking the video even before watching it... trust ur content 😊
Matlab kuch bhi yaar 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻💯💯
Really u r right. Such a non sense
The best suggestion for your channel would be to stop making these repetitive videos and make something more indulgent and smart videos which we all know that you are capable of. You definitely don&#39;t need to rely on a &#39;matlab kuch bhi&#39; video rather a &#39;matlab kuch bhi&#39; moment in a normal interesting video will be more appreciated.
I personally never forgot 1 2 ka four because except this mind boggling scene, the movie is really a good one with a different storyline, strong performances &amp; some good music! 👍😊
Wierd things said in Indian movie relating it to &quot;Sher&quot;. And Sher is like &#39;WTF. Maine kab bola&#39;
Okay let me be frank. This guy just goes on and on about verbal and physical abuse towards women. Yes I agree, it&#39;s wrong to hit a women but can you talk about movies where WOMEN HAVE SLAPPED MEN and movies where one woman&#39;s actions have led the man to turn into a monster. Stop supporting one gender. Try being neutral please! Feminists ko waise bhi equality chahiye aur ab agar ek ladki ne kuchch galat kiya toh thappad toh pada chahiye. Haan, agar kisi ladki ya aurat ko kisi galti ke bina maraa, toh galat hai. Hitting a man is okay but hitting a women is not? Shove this idea of feminism up your ass.If y&#39;all do not agree with me, replying to my comment is totally not worth it. Tumhare replies se mere opinions change nahi honge
Shaadi karke phaas gaya yaar is one of the most misogynistic, regressive and stupid movie of the decade
Woaaa..that lafa from Salman was terrifying and hilarious..couldv&#39;e cracked her jaw off..😂😂
In before all the white knights invade the video
have you seen  DANGAL girl
I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s out of idea for title now
U r views on total dhamaal plz
Physical abuse !! Huh . How many came to support Aishwarya when Salman abused her.. Instead she got alienated, thanks to her talent and luck her career didn&#39;t end. That doesn&#39;t end there , those bastard Bhai fans are still abusing Aishwarya for leaving their Abusive Bhai..When our society and  people are only regressive then why to blame the movies!! First reform the society.. Specially the Bhai <a href="http://fans.now/">fans.now</a> they are against Priyanka,coz she declined Bharat..huh..Girls don&#39;t even have the right to take decision.

Just see your film industry just made worse and unscientific movies
Your videos are nice, but lets be honest. The so called progressive movies which are made by directors in the end turn up as molestors too. Just showing progressiveness on screen wont let in disappearance of our patriarchal society. Start of 90s and 2000s were a different time. We have reached now at a point where it is said that we should stamp a baby as girl or buy and it should be gender fluid etc.

RIP to do kabutar🕊️🕊️
scenes where woman slap man were also portrayed in lot of movies, never seen anyone criticising them. Women&#39;s violence is ok but men need to check theirs... That is what i called insane double standards... I don&#39;t agree to some of your statements in this video... men who harass or deceive women derves to be slapped, and so does women who humiliate or deceive men...
I don&#39;t think there is anything logical or illogical about any movie scenes. Since everything around us constantly evolves we tend to start perceiving things differently. As we notice in those days villain had bizarre explanations for the crimes they had committed and the audience found that logical and the scene where Salman Slaps Shilpa seemed right to the audience in those days except now we feel disgusted when we see it again. I am sure in future, same criticism will happen for the current movies.
Well, Ranjha clearly was not into meh... wait for it... boob.
Fatima Sana Shaikh 👆🤔 1 2 ka 4 scene ??
The way Salman bhai Hits Shilpa Shetty here is the same way he hit Aishwarya Rai.😂😂
