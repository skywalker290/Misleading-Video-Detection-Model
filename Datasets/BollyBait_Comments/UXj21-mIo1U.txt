कौन कौन यहां संदीप रेड्डी वांगा का इंटरव्यू देखने के बाद आया😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Last review of his life 😂😂😂😂
Where are you today Fatty?
Recently saw Sandeep Vanga Reddys interview where he said that he was invited by Rajeev Masand for a round Table. Sandeep plainly said &quot;dude you hate my guts for making movie kike Kabir singh then what are you going to talk in round table. he politely declined Rajeev. loved this attitude of Sandeep Reddy Vanga. hypocrite critics like Rajeev Masand deserves such reply
Vanga separated his fat, melted it and sprinkled salt and pepper on it 😂<br>Animal movie review kar ke bata, iss baar genda 🦛 bolega vanga 😂
Review which got him out of job😂😂
Fat bro review Animal as well
Who s here after animal
Watching after Animal😂
Came back watching this video after ANIMAL 😂<br>So Glad Rajeev has stopped reviewing movies. We don&#39;t need his &quot;words of wisdom&quot; anymore
You should retire
Accha hua isne film reviews chod diya. Animal kha jaata isse
Salt and pepper guy 😂😂
ANIMAL...?????
If Martin Scorcses and Quintin Tarentino made films in India, they would be not be spared by these critics. But who gives them a F#₹k anyway?
last scene of ranbir in movie animal is for you Rajeev . to be precise the one shot in blacknwhite 😁
There is a Sault and pepper guy 🤣🤣 glad that Vanga fkd him with describing 🤣🤣🤣
Rajeev SRV don&#39;t give daam on ur shit reviews, he will be on his own n original , direct a film on ur own then people like us will review that , do u have that balls to direct a movie....???
Just came to see the &quot;fat guy&quot;.
We should thank this legend for giving us animal 😂
Please review Animal, Salt &amp; Pepper
Fatty😂😂
Here after Animal
Many are here after success of Animal
legand says animal burnol for anupama and rajeev was conceptualised after this !!
Salt pepper fat guy😂
Sandeep Reddy really ended Masand&#39;s career 😂
Animal ka end cradit esi ke liye tha kya 😂😂
Oh you are the salt pepper guy
Who are here after animal release 😂
Visiting this review after watching vanga interview
I wonder what would he say about Animal 💀
Who is this fat salt and pepper guy😊
Pig ( Rajeev) doesn’t know the Sandal wood perfume smell .    You gave 2 rating . That’s why it collected 300 CR.  It is a movie, watch it like a movie.  Don’t expect it is documentary with some message .
you oldie doesn&#39;t know to watch films... its good that you stopped reviewing films.
Stiil Inside burning of Rajeev masand didnt go off because of sandeep Heights 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ofc the fact👍
I m sure u gona cry after animal 😂
Nice try sheep(rajeev masand)
I rate your review 0 out of 5
Chal be chu*iye 😂
this guy triggered animal (violent film)
Aftet Animal
This is the main reason why Bollywood never became versatile Flim Industry like Hollywood cz If Bollywood make Flim like Fight Club, American Psyco then those critics give those Flim 1*😂
Who&#39;s here after Animal Trailer
Please review animal trailer sir
Who&#39;s here after animal trailer. Just to show them what&#39;s masculinity was and should be.
May be it’s not celebrating masculinity. May be it’s presenting story of people like Kabir Singh
Salt and pepper hair 😂😂 if you know you know
this comment section is gold after sandeep interview with anupama 🤣
salt and paper guy :)
Ok guy watch Barbie movie
Stupid joker instead of bashing a movie once produce and direct a movie.
Such a toxic film review. Kabir Singh was a wonderful film.😊
Fat man with salt and peer head🤣🤣👏👏he&#39;s should go and work as philosopher, he forgot his job here..
No one in the movie said he is a saint. His parents, the professor in the beginning and even hero’s friend tells how tarki he became. <br><br>Kabir singh is a flawed and egotistic character. I agree some scenes are problematic but atleast they showed his flaws and his attempt to overcome to them.<br><br>Unlike some films where hero is showed as a good and saint guy inspite of doing obnoxious things.
Bhai aapko to pel diya sandeep reddy vanga ne... Animal ki success ke baad or masala milega. <br>Be ready 😂😂😂
FAT GUY SALT AND PEPPER HAIR
Anupama Chopra and Rajeev masand mostly don&#39;t like south movies😂
This anchor and critic is shame of Bollywood dark shit
This creepy fat guy hahaha
♥️da
Sandeep reddy vanga made this guy famous😎😎
Randa of the Year.
Kabir singh was a misognist and preeti was a submissive at the beginning bt throughout the film she break out of her submissive shell that&#39;s empowerment.... <br>Nobody notes that point...
5/5
Tumlogo ke bolne se kuch nii hoga🤣🤣🤣
Mental kabir..
Well watching this review after so many years i can just clap 👏👏👏👏 at the foresight of director Sandeep Vanga Reddy interview in Film Companion where he called such critics the parasites of film industry.  Truly the credit for the lessening of popularity of Bollywood movies compared to South movies in Hindi belt and lessening of quality itself in Bollywood movies except for few good, can be laid at the doorstep of these critics and stars who listen to them . Writing this on 19 may2022 , a month after kgf2 kannda movie dubbed in many languages including hindu released and still running all over India and also RRR and Pushpa also south movies has done well. Pls critics we wish Bollywood also to give us general audience some good movies, why should every movie be arty so that u guys clap?? Pls filmmakers we ordinary people make your average masala movie hit by giving money, why cannot u make better masala like rrr, kgf etc,  we will repeatedly watch and you will earn even more 🙏🙏🙏
U r absolutely rt, rajeev
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Words of wisdom 👍
Why critics tell there political and social opinion rather than just movie
The kashmir Files का भी review कर ले
This reviw destroyed whole carrier of Rajeev 🤣🤣🤣
Now ur show is for awakening laughter
Look at you old school uncle with no clue of new age films
He is absolutely right there is only fat within u no sense at all...<br>If i close my eyes and listen to your review i often get confused it&#39;s woman or man reviewing the filim
Usually critics end film makers Carrers. But Sandeep reddy ended Rajeev career.
Just searched Rajeev Masand after watching Sandeep Reddy Vanga&#39;s interview<br>Perfectly described &quot; fat guy with salt and pepper hair &quot; 🤣🤭🤣<br>Sandeep Reddy Vanga is the real life Kabir Singh 🔥
Who was that fat guy ?
Rajiv watch sandeep interview…u will commit suicide
Your talking style is very different
This movie is tickling you very bad Rajeev , Man from Telugu State shoken you like ice cubes in a box , reason being that no movie in your circle made this number , Rage , Cult classic.<br>Proud of you Sandeep ❤️❤️❤️
Fat guy with salt and pepper 😂😂
Chal jootha
Kabir singh is cringiest movie i&#39;ve ever seen lol.
Akku theyliyadhu hooku theyliyadhu Nik endhuku ra
Corrupt review 😅
Chaman bandaa 🤣🤣🤣
Salt and pepper uncle.. Namste
Pora Rey pooka.. Elli dabbulu iche valla Sanka Naku... Sanka Naki Naki creativity ni cheda mingi Potta penchav... Nv evadra asalu review iyaniki , mysogyny anta chekka ga...
WHEN PREETI SLAPPED KABIR SINGH:- <br><br>If you watch the movie carefully, when Kabir drops Preeti for a vacation, she keeps on pleading that she does not want to go, and she wants to stay for atleast 2 days more, Kabir shouts back at her... At this moment, PREETI SLAPS KABIR... If you don&#39;t remember this, watch the movie once again...<br> People who are blabbering about toxic masculinity of this film focus only on the point when he slapped her.
Gadha
rajiv masand <br>tu hme nahi pasand
Rajeev na Pasand, stop reviewing films. Make sure to watch Sandeep&#39;s review on your review in the film companion talk.
Sandeep called him &quot;Parasite of Industry&quot;... Actually true. They live depending on Industry, not by involved in 24 crafts of Industry.
Here after Sandeep vanga Reddy&#39;s interview 😂😂😂
Fat guy with salt and pepper hair 🤣🤣🤣
Why don&#39;t you have a problem with Devadas ?<br>He was arrogant, reckless, treated paro like his property, drunk and also abusive in some places but you don&#39;t have a problem with that because its a cult film. It was made in an era where people were not that woke. But when the same character gets replicated in today&#39;s environment you feel uneasy. <br><br>Sure I agree that the character Kabir Singh is a deeply flawed young man. But that&#39;s not a problem because men in real life are flawed. So instead of being bashful of the character review the film on its plot, acting and technicalities, you carbohydrates sack.
great critic, before ctisising movie just check how your reviews are going. u call yourself as a top critic. better u delete this video for some people who atleast follow you. Make them survive😂 salt and pepper Hero.
M samne hota to 3000 jhapet marta
Guys please please wait for RX100 salt &amp; pepper will tell new logic 🤣🤣🤣 pseudo Fat guy.
Rajeev manpasand.. 😂😂<br>Kisi ko pasand nhi h ye.. 🤣🤣
U r too soft on this movie review sir, it deserves 0...🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚
He has to go for therapy after reading the reviews of his review 😂😂...Famous last words &quot; I am going with 2 out of 5&quot;...public went with 379 crores .....RIP
Shut up you dont know anything about movies. Sanju is a good movie for you. We know your bias.
Ha has a point.., I agree
Biased review. Supari review
Ohoo he is the guy with salt and pepper hair.. and a fat chick😄
When you can&#39;t accept constructive criticism, you go around calling people names for doing their jobs. Don&#39;t fucking make movies then?
Abe mote India ko review suna rha hai England ko,hindi me bol
Chalo fir<br>Kal se jaake pogo, CN, Disney XD , Cartoons ka review dena...<br>Isko kabir sing hi dikhta hai, Kitne movies hai mad geroes pe,<br>KGF hai, kuch bola? Nahi<br>Understand the context low IQ man<br>Kabir stubbornness and anger led his life to a situation where he self destruct himself loses job, come to road then changes himself and foes to his family again and gets he love also back!<br>Did this movie explained that taking drugs is a good option?<br>Children and Low IQ people only can get influenced by this
blind fans in the comment section ughhhh disgusting mentality
After sandeep interview fat guy with .....
Look at his sitting style guys!! He is like a kid complaining about Kabir singh to his mom!! 😂😂😂😂
This comment section just proves the fact that misogyny is deeply rooted in Indian society. India has no chance of developing with majority of people having this shitty patriarchal mindset.
Fat guy with salt and pepper hair 😂 😂😂😂👌
Oho...he is the guy with salt and papper hair
I agree that kabir slapping preeti was completely wrong.<br>But In Starting when preeti slapped Kabir then why it is considered as a form of love and cute???<br>In many movies when women slaps men then why it is considered as cute and love but opposite is abuse??<br>Example - ending scene of 3 idiots, thor 2 mid scene.<br>Violence against both genders is wrong and both should be criticised.
Kabir singh is awesome . Loved a <a href="http://lot.fyi/">lot.FYI</a>,  I am from Andhra. This is the first time reviewers were reviewed by the people. Don&#39;t give rating to the movies. Its unfair.
This Video Is Not Recommended You Just Searched It After Watching Sandeep Interview With Anupama Chopra
The Guy With Salt And Pepper Hair😂.
COMMENTS DELETE HO RE H 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rajiv looks like kiara&#39;s dad reviewing
When idiot reviews a movie, what can you expect. Disliked already.
Salt and paper hair😂😂. Nobody fucking care about your review. Kabir singh is a awesome movie
Dont feel bad Sir Sandeel sir Knows Your Name he Was just Kidding
This review by fat Rajiv is made for laughs he should retrire and head for Kashi to be a sanyasi.
😂😂😂😂😂 poor rajeev
You have to leave this critic chair buddy
The ratio of dislikes to likes is actually scary and shows the mentality of people watching such films. This movie is problematic as hell, the fact that people don&#39;t see it, and glorify the crap out of such characters is actually worrying
Salt n peepar get ready for Animal😂😂
So much bodyshaming in the comment section. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23snowflakes">#snowflakes</a>

Jelous on face 😂. Who in the world can do that.
Directly proportional to Sanju. 👍🏼
Ye motu ko koi maro
He knows nothing about films
And I am going with -5 / 5 with you reviewing, shows the amount of money you received to defame the movie gone in vain.
The like-dislike ratio says it all😎 fatty with salt and pepper hair🤭
Veedu veedi yedava vaatam. . <br>Yellesssss

Who’s that fat guy with salt and pepper hairs
salt n pepper piggy
but rajeev is not wrong. i also felt the same while watching it in theatre..
You look like frog..After sandeep interview n last kangnas interview ..I hav no doubt that u hav vested interests.. Bollywood keep this man away
Sandeep sir reply for him through me NIKAL LAVDE pehli fursat main nikal , nahi jaro rat Bollywood ko teri .
Bikkao reviewer
I never seen a dislikes twicer  than likes
Stupid Rajeev masand...he encourages nepotism...idiot
Like literally... The ratio of likes and dislikes says it all...🤞
Will give  minus 2 for this review.. worst and stupid review ever..
In my opinion, Kabir had anger management issues which cannot be peddled off as misogynistic behaviour. He was a jerk at times to everyone across the spectrum and not specifically to women. It&#39;s alright if you disagree but this monogamous relationship and Kabir&#39;s wildfire passion,unwavering loyalty and love for Preeti and his parents restores my belief in an all encompassable love.
Thank you rajeev . I havent seen your other reviews but this one is honest enough. I mean what the hell ?? How could People actually like this immatured film 😠??
&quot;Slat and pepper&quot; 😂😂
BC
I m just here after sandip sir interview 😂
2/5 ? Wow, he is generous.
I am soo lucky I never saw any of this salt pepper haired guy reviews.<br>By the way came here after Sandeep&#39;s interview.
Leave this business you know nothing
Most shameful review ever of Rajeev masand&#39;s....you should be ashamed of yourself for making such horrible comments about a film. You should have talked about other aspects of the film also.
Kya bol raha hai bhai...just enjoy the movie...love is like this!!
sanju is good movie for your because your colleague husband is producing it.... <br>Your critic, atleast do your profession properly.... Partially favoured money bookie reviewer.... <br>time waste reviewer...
Sale motu Sandeep ne ye dono exhibit tere liye hi banaye Vanga ne
3.5/5
2/5 seriously
😂 look at the dislikes Mr. Salt &amp; Pepper fatty🤣
You are not a movie critic. You are a social activist. Movie is an art. When we tune into a movie critic&#39;s show, we tune in for understanding which strokes of the art of movie did the team behind the movie got right and which one&#39;s did they not.  We don&#39;t need a lesson in social science from a movie critic. There are professors who are dealing with the subject of social sciences. Let&#39;s let them do their job and let&#39;s do ours.
Fatty and salt peper hair<br>😀😀😀
Librandu bc
Rajiv Masand, I give your existance a generous 5 stars....out of 100
I think words that hate by sandeep for his rest of life will be &quot;Salt and Pepper&quot;
Poor school of thoughts

U r full negativity <br>U r horrible  n u get 0/100 for this review

ye gadha...every time i see him on you tube...channel is blocked.
Bohut English janta hain magar zyada English mey bak bak mat karna
Rajeev masand 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Kabir is a faulty character. But by the end....he changes himself. The only problem in this movie is the way he approaches Preeti. Its no way to impress a girl. He has no idea of consent and respect. <br>Rest, everything was fine. He got anger outbursts, he had ridiculous ego.....but these things led to his self destruction. Finally the movie ended happily becoz he left his bad habits and apologized Preeti for all he did to her.
Ya but the film was way different from the shitty  bollywood love stories and the audience got something to see which signifies their own anger ,anguish , emotions etc. And yeah the film was a blockbuster on box office.
Fat 🎅 with Salt &amp; Pepper Hair 🤣
Fatty with Salt and pepper hair.       Hhhaaa
Who says he has not taken consent? Has the girl slapped him there? Was Preety a dumb girl? (May be you are a dumb audience). Did you understand the relevance of the Holi scene where, Kabir says that in his life Preety matters the most and both of them started crying? Have you ever been in love, truly? He was ready to have her in his life when she was pregnant, it was misogynistic? Have you taken permission or consent of people when, in the AIB you were openly doing stupid, unfunny abuse in the name of free speech??
Bad Review. . Its not 2 out of 5 star rating<br><br>You are shitting 2 in 5 star hotel. . .
People : enjoy movies like Kabir Singh <br>Also People : knows no human being wants company like Kabir, and these kind of boys end up in jail eventually.
Fat guy with louda lasun face .....
Kabir singh was the worst piece of shut ever!
The literacy ratio can be seen in the like-dislike ratio.
Don&#39;t do reviews 👎
u gave 3.5 stars to sanju.......such a hypocrite............paid criticccccc
why is this fat butch lesbian with salt and pepper hair squealing?<br><br><br>PS: Mr Sandeep Vanga Reddy is a genius.
Fat guy salt and pepper hair🤣 can&#39;t get off it even now🤣
U gave just 2 for d film but audience gave 200cr to the film!! U wasted Ur tym 😂😂😂
Fat guy with salt &amp; pepper hair 😂😂
Hey pepper hair kid do u understand y ur video has more dislikes than likes because we all are 18+ we were understood the movie is actually about. Don&#39;t show the differences. Of course u have the right but dont cry like a kid plez.. This is my personal suggestion. Be like a man not a 👶👶👶👶👶🚼🚼🚼🚼🚼
Salt and pepper hair 🤣. Sandeep reddy vanga rocked and pepper hair boy shocked and cried like   small kid
fat guy with salt and pepper hair
He was not final year student...he was a house surgeon...tht comes after internship... that&#39;s how close you have watched the movie
tor kono ar kaj nei...wara...<br>if you watched Sanju...then you never judge Kabir Singh..<br>and by the way this movie not for you...a old man can&#39;t understand this movie...<br>this movie make only for young guy.. 20-28 (age)..<br>ek chukti sindur ka kimat tumko nahi.. Patha
You are played for laughs
Kabir Singh is everything that you&#39;re not...<br>Charming, Handsome, Confident, Doesn&#39;t give a shit about a bloated potato <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thiswasobjectification">#ThisWasObjectification</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sorrynotsorry">#SorryNotSorry</a>
Its mysogynic and movie with a man having mental issues... songs are good but theme is pathetic... acting is the only reason movie deserves 2 stars... this is not love its obsession n madness
This  movie  is  stupid  ... But  i admire  the  acting  and  hard work  of  shahid
Iss bande ko review dene aata hai?
How the hell is it justifying by comparing your movie &#39; kabir singh&#39; with any other movie and saying ki woh movie mai chalta hai, usko tum 5 star rating dogay par is movie ko nai? Toh matlab tum agree kar rahe ho kabir singh mai problem hai right? Director ne ye soch kar movie banae hai kya ki baki ki movies mai ho raha toh mai bhe waisa movie banaunga, nai na..usko ye sari batein sahi lagi , appropriate lagi isliye woh itne chaud mai interviews mai bhe apne baton mai ada hai, aur critics ko insult kar rha. So anyone who has any objection with the movie is a parasite, femanzii, and stupif
Salt paper hair
Just dislike the video by showing our middle finger to salt &amp; pepper guy..
kabir singh is best bollywood movie ever
See the dislike ,,,,,, you got the answer
I am always laughing whenever i see your review... People always reject it..... You gave 2 *  and Kabir Shing became Blockbuster....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shame on you @Rajeev Masand.

300 + girls 3 STARS<br>5-6 A SCENES 1 STAR <br>Great review mr . Maaaaasaassaaaannnnndddd thuuuuuu!!!
More than double no. of dislikes. This is a clear display of our love for KABIR SINGH!! Let a movie be JUST A MOVIE !! Watch it and enjoy instead of conducting a post mortem.
In this review Rajeev Masand said she is off the market, is she a thing on the market, feminist has no objection for such words.
Chup fat guy lovde
Kabir Singh Earned 318 cr in India...enjoy Masand ji

24 k dislikes.. Time for the fat guy to retire.
I hate this Fat guy with salt and pepper hair..
Go and learn something from TheAngryRantman
Just came to see this fat guy after sandeep sirs words
Fat guy with salt and pepper hair
Tell this fat guy to make one movie then. I feel like they can&#39;t handle the south content-- which is in fact realistic. Nobody wants flying cars and dodging bullets in south anymore, all they want is a story and moments to cherish.
Finally find that fat guy with salt &amp; pepper😂😂
Fuck...u rajeev masand.... chootiya
Useless film
Looser you are !!!!
Salt n pepper
the number of dislikes shows the kind of critic he is..looser
Rajeev masand plz interview sandeep vangga <br>Faad dega tumhari
Salt and pepper hair hahahahha
Do you know what review is ??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What the f* -k
Thanks fat guy to give us this movie review
Rajeev masand 🖕🖕🖕 This is for you🖕🖕🖕🖕
Fat guy with salt and pepper hair perfectly matched....milgaya louda
I think this guy didn&#39;t got ah love ... His voice 🥴🥴🥴 I think he  dubbs for Chota bheem bholu doolu 🤣🤣..
Overintellectual critics
Rajeev why can&#39;t u say it in a simple language
Itna logic dhundega to ghanta tera review.... mere taraf se tere review ko 👎🏾
the FG with SP hair seems to have had an emotional break down after watching the movie, he hallucinates the movie was real life....forgive him he has lost it. May be  director and actor are not his fav...Peace
Typical North Indian Ignorance about Films
This movie highlights everything wrong with Bollywood. And the dislikes are proof of how cheap our audience is which supports unrealistic toxic masculinity and bullying
Me sirf dislike krne aaya hu...bhag bho**dike
Bullshit review by you Rajeev Sir, I loved Kabir Singh. Trust me he is true lover. Do you care about women rapped everyday in India. Man just use woman and throw them away, they dont care even the women in their home. I have seen such cases. My maid she works so hard for raising her kids and her husband just beats her after drinking alochol. Do you care about such women???<br>Kabir Singh had only one issue that he is short tempered. But he is so loving and caring to love of his life. Did you noticed that?<br>Its a nice movie in my opinion.
Please don&#39;t watch RX 100..you will get Cardiac arrest!!
To people questioning Rajeev&#39;s favourable ratings for Sanju :<br>Hooking up with 300 plus women is a matter of least significance and totally okay as long as you respect the person you&#39;re with. Love is all about giving after all. <br>Non consensual forceful love, beating your girl, acting like a dick and a crazy asshole stalker are all despicable actions and will surely lend you a restraining order, which this garbage film celebrates. <br>Completely agree with you Rajeev. Been a long time follower of yours and absolutely enjoy your reviews.<br>This film is crap. Period.
Sale chutiye ko add bi mila h asa bakwas review ke video ke liye .... Youtube becm mad nw 😡😡
Could you just shut up?<br>Its the best film. I hv seen, ever!
Fat guy,worrst review
Mota man critic are no girl friend
To understand these movie you have be man you gay
One word...blockbuster<br>No one cares about your opinion
Saala haathi ka bachha
A person whos fat like a pig cant tKe care of his own ftness, is judging others!! Heights of hypocrisy😆
Buddy just open up a spoken English coaching center...suits you.....don t be an idiotic film critic
Honest review it is. Dislike the movie, sad that ppl but such movies
My opinion - Kabeer Singh is a movie banging the minds of the audience after SAIRAAT, that&#39;s the stature of Kabeer Singh !<br>And for you Rajeev Masand - You never mentioned about SHIVA - supporting role as a friend to Kabeer Singh, Jia Sharma, Kabeer&#39;s family, neither this Masand mentioned about the excellent music and singing quality, excellent intermission plus title reveal with adrenaline running background score, that&#39;s Kabeer Singh you critic.<br>Shame on you Rajeev Masand - Kabeer Singh deserves 4.5 minimum. You wished to give that stereotype Dangal 5 out of 5 even after finding mistakes, but here audience gave you tight slap by hitting the box office.
Unlike the fat guy with salt n pepper hair I give kabir singh 4.5 stars out of 5.   Amazing movie
Fat guy with salt and pepper 😂😂😂😂
Rajiv sounds toxic... not sure whether it&#39;s masculine and feminist... But he is for. Sure a. Mangina
Reality is these guys from Bollywood fraternity can&#39;t digest the fact that a director comes from South and remakes a movie and gets appreciation from audience and makes new box office records.
Sandeep vanga killed him by words 😂😂😂 salt pepper hairstyle
Salt pepper guy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is chutiye ko bolo Like Dislike ratio dkha kare aake idhar
I am going to stop watching his review . I will dislike his video . He has just hate for some people . He is not review ing movie but spread ing the hate.... people don&#39;t listen his review
Look at like and dislike ratio which defines this critic is a dumbass
He is biased critics
Furrrrrr furrrrr
The only reason why I never subscribe to this channel is because of rajveev Masand. Rajveev Masand, please get out of this job do a favor to film industry idiot.
Rajeev Masand, I give One and half star out of 5. You are a below average film critic.
First review of Rajiv Masand I agree with.
Exhibit A: You haven&#39;t done your job well. You have probably seen the movie in haste with the sole objective of bringing out the review.<br><br>Exhibit B: What rubbish review was that? Have the standards of reviewers fallen to such a low level. I think the films and filmmakers are doing fine, what the country needs is good critics, whose review can sharpen the intellect of the audience. <br><br>Exhibit C: Your review, the level of it probably could have been even accomplished by a 17 year old. Your review looked like a joke.
A rubbish review of a brilliant movie. <br><br>A fim is not supposed to preach to society. It is a merely a medium to channel an idea , a story and to arouse emotions.
Fat guy salt pepper hair...lodu
Kch kam nhi h inn log k pas.. bs english m pdhai complete kro.. kch na kr sko to critic bn jao.. beithe beithe pet bdhao.. or bs comment kro.. kisi achi movie ko brbd kro.. ya h jante h ye log<br>Pr ek chiz bhul jate h.. k sb s bda critic public.. h.. film psnd to blockbuster.. koi critic kch v kahe sb bkwas
Even more respect for you sir now after this honest review. Thank you.
Salt &amp; pepper on top of ham
These days i watch a lot of tv series based on serial killers,  sex offenders,  like Mindhunters,  unbelievable,etc. And today when i sat down to watch kabir singh on netflix. I thought i am watching a movie about a man who will become a serial sex offender someday and the movie is so apallingly trying to portray him as good. Seriously this kabir singh character is similar to sex offenders who sometimes become serial rapists. One of the worst i have ever wasted my 20 mins on.  I cdnt watch after 20 mins. Such disgusting piece of shit.
Stop acknowledging urself as a critic.....such a fake man....
I think problem is not with mr rajeev masand or salt and pepper guy as the the people in comments are tagging him in search for few likes and to boost their appalling self confidence, its problem with people who get so much influenced with their revered directors and actors! Just because the director vented out against him, doesn&#39;t mean we also take the cue! Even I would not have given this movie more than 2 or 2.5 that too only because it was impactful in few places, nice songs and shahid performance. The movie as such was a mess like kabir singh! I honestly thought midway his character would die like devdas in end, but nowhere I thought he would have a happy ending that too with same girl. Director has very wrong notion of passion! He even said in interview if you are not hitting yours partners you don&#39;t have it ! Kabir singh is basically a cinematic representation of himself.  People questioning rajeev for his ratings on sanju ,are pure idiots! Firstly sanju was a biopic, his wrong doings weren&#39;t glorified and most importantly even if he slept with 300 women it was with consent! People making multiple accounts on YouTube just to dislike this video shows how jobless and brainless they really  are and how naive to be bloody influenced by the director! I never understood why kiara character would fall for kabir singh! Most stupid ever! Yes gals do fell for bad guys but it doesn&#39;t  happen that bad guy comes and announces you are mine and dictates her! That&#39;s harassment!
Did not know all movies have to be sanskari.The character of Kabir Singh could have been termed as &quot;glorified&quot; if we would have come out of the theatre feeling bad for him,but we obviously did not,Everyone knows he is a negative and bad character.Unlike Sanju where an out and out negative character is shown in a positive light with so many justifications
You are a Pathetic critic...
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fatguywithsaltandpepperboy">#fatguywithsaltandpepperboy</a>😂😂😂😂
Dude your job is to review movies not narrating the story in short and summarizing it. U could have atleast talked about shahid&#39;s acting, screenplay, dialogues, songs, story but unfortunately u didn&#39;t talk about anything in specific. Hypocrisy at it&#39;s best 😏. Thank god this video has more dislikes thn likes🙏
2/5 😂😂😂 278cr 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 <br>What a review !
Film critic like Rajeev masand etc they r making new generation Sick

Came here after fat guy salt pepper hair, roasting at its best
salee tu ek film nikal ke dhikha
Mr. Masand, sometimes try to come out of your zone of regular reviewing, try to understand  a different film making
No one :<br>Internet: fat guy with salt and pepper hair
Fat guy with salt and pepper hair  :D :D
came here just to read the comments :D :D not your shitty review Rajeev napasand
pseudo SICKulars
He looks like grown up Dennis the menace
Don&#39;t whine if CNN IBN goes bankrupt in couple of years (if they are not, already). Why? Look at the person who there are stubbornly persisting with for their movie reviews. The person reviewing the cinema should be a representation  of the audience or the diaspora, the cinema going public belongs to. 8.8k likes to 23k dislikes. It is such a shame. @CNN-IBN, check out the likes to dislikes ratio of the top independent content creators of India and they are in the ratio of 95:5 and those guys would garner 10 times more views than your fat with salt&#39;n pepper haired blob of butter you have hired for reviewing movies. That&#39;s because they are the representatives of whatever genres they make videos on. Irrespective of this movie, Mr. Rajeev Masand never garnered good like to dislike ratios  and never will because he was never and never will be the representation of the Indian cinema going public.
From now onwards i realised he is lacking cinema knowledge.....he is not a reviewer he is professor in college😜😜😜
Thank god someone did an actual review.... Like how impractical someone has to be to actually like this movie.<br>It&#39;s my personal view and many would be offended
We&#39;ll Rajeev You were so polite and cultural and well mannered in AIB roast! I truly admire your ethics 😇
I don’t understand if these people understand movies so much why don’t they make one??
Mote tounde
Everything is fair in love and war
This is the worst review I have ever seen. He did not speak anything about the crafts of the film. He better stop reviewing films. Sitting in chair and defaming the great work done by others is easy. I think you can&#39;t even make a 2-3 minutes of short film with quality. You don&#39;t have any skills about the film making. But you&#39;re reviewing a film and declaring that this is not a good one. See ... the audience loved it. It collected around 300cr. In my opinion these critics should have a qualification to become a critic in film industries. They must direct at least 20 films in the past or they should have been a part of one of the 24 crafts of the film. Then we can understand that they are GENUINE reviewers/critics. Critic doesn&#39;t mean they always criticize a thing. They should encourage the CHANGE in film industry. New directors are coming up with new thoughts and different screenplay &amp; different style of making films. <br>Just because you know fluent ENGLISH, you can&#39;t be a critic or reviewer. Get some basics of the FILM MAKING. Until then, stop reviewing the films. <br>Don&#39;t criticize me if I made any grammar/spelling mistakes in this comment bcz I&#39;m not CRITIC but a COMMON FILM LOVER.
Here is salt where is pepper 🤣
Fat guy salt and pepper
23k dislikes satisfied ☺️
You gave 2 stars and people gave 200cr+...just go to hell
Sbse Correct review h apka kabir singh aur bakki toh bs chamchagiri kr rhe h is movie ki
I love this review. Thank you so much 👍
Kabir singh ko 2*/5* diya.<br>Rajiv masand is 2 rupees people...
Chup fat guy sAlt n pepper....
Hi Rajeev really cant understand your logic giving 2.5 stars for de de pyaar de,and for a brilliant film like kabir singh you are giving 2 stars.<br>I am sorry mr Rajeev this is non sense utter non sense.
Tujhe toh Shahid ne hi jawaab de diya <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXj21-mIo1U&amp;t=59">0:59</a> par
🤣🤣🤣
80% of what he said is true !!
Remember that video, something like harassment through ages in cinema, playing laal dupatte song..! Girls supporting one girl (harassing) man.. why not go back sati ritual,man&#39;s multiple marriage, instant divorce power of man.<br>I wish to see not married women to succeed like Rihanna etc.
Aap ko koi haq nahin banta hai ki aap sab ko bole ki yeh film bilkul decent nahin hai.Kuch different dikha raha hai koi toh ap ko mirchi lag rahin hai.Bade bade shabdo mein angrezi bol ke gyaan mat dijiye.Aap ke bolne se kuch farq nahin parta.Hum audeience jante hai ki yeh film hai jo thodi alag si hai.Humein yeh film bohot achhi lagi hai.Feministic movie nahin hai yeh
Rajeev masand ji aap ko lagta hai ki Kabir singh achha nahin hai toh thik hai
Have you ever heard a donkey fart... never mind just listen to this critics voice..
Tumhare review se kuch pharak nahi padta
I am sitting with popcorns to read comments here.....Rajeev ki le li sabne
I agree with u 100% .
Fat guy with the salt and pepper hair,.... Why you have not reviewed KGF..tell me..?
Bessan
YOU ARE TOO GOOD MAN TOO GOOD WHAT YOU STATED IS ABSOLUTELY  ON POINT AND RIGHT
Im going with 0.25 out of 5 stars for this review.
hahaha...what a joke!!
Agree that Sanju...glorifies the hero with bad traits...but that doesn&#39;t mean  questions cannot be raised about the aggressive nature of Kabir Singh...and that this problematic character should be celebrated...anything that is wrong can be questioned... But someway sad part is only central characters which are aggressive and have negetive shades become more exciting...and draw the interest of the audience
Y so many dislikes wat he said was absolutely correct this movie is a serious misguide<br>Too much misogynist<br>Wid zero % value toh a course as medicine seriously film industry should come out of the trash n stop boosting such unruly mindsets
Fat guy with salt n pepper hair 😂...well described by Sandeep Sir
Chal mote ..😡😡
You need to understand that Kabir Singh got unreasonably angry with the maid for breaking a glass as it reminded him of his ladylove hurting her foot over broken glass. Lot of things in this movie were innuendoes and not spelt out as the audience is more mature now. I think the movie and all its stars esp Kabir Singh and Shiva were amazing and deserve a national award
I saw your review for Sanju and you gave 3.5 with all praises, payment for fake review not received in this one i assume , KRK seems to be doing better then you
Abe motay
How does it feel to have dislikes three times more than likes? I think this is history
U r paid, or patron someone. Anyone doing better is a threat. Good bye Rajdeep. U r no longer one a critic. Ur intelligence didn’t reach a plateau but declined. This is not how u grow man.

kitne paise khaye bhai sahab to showcase such negativity for a movie. How can you review a movie the from the characters being bad or good rather than the acting and the songs and the script and the story. ? paise lekar apni soul dechna kabb chodenge tum jaise reviewers god knows
Such a biased reviewer boycott this salt pepper guy
Who cares about your reviews..the audience makes the movie flop or successful, not ur fking biased reviews. Just go and watch the box office collection <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fat">#fat</a>_guy with Salt and pepper hairs
I think this unfamiliar reviewer or critic hates South India...
On the name of critic this fat guy with salt pepper hair😂😂<br>He Is just hypocrite he doesn&#39;t have any problem with Sanju movie and give star 3 1/2 but with Kabir Singh he has all problem with that character.. <br>How they can review any movie with some agenda already in their mind.<br>Why he has only problem with Kabir Singh why not with safina and Sanju for that movie alia n Ranbir  done fabulous work, but what about Kabir Singh...<br>He gave <br>Super 30, judgemental hai kya, kesari 2 and half star<br>And also Kalank same star<br>How can he gave same star to that shit kalank just becoz that is belongs to that shitty production house...
U giving 2 star to kabir singh .........slow claps movie which deserve 4 star .....

I used to wait for your reviews... But for this one... You should watch the interview of the director Sandeep Reddy with Anupama Chopra ...<br>You might get some clarifications and better foresight.
Exhibit X - Rajeev Masand is that fat guy with salt and pepper hair look which does round in the internet and people are over does in laugh. He has more dislikes than likes for this review. I reviewed his review , pls stop it for sake.
No mention about writing screenplay dialogue and background score...critics should talk about every element of the movie . ..
wtf he saying ??
Fat guy;-)

Middle finger for nonsense....
You call yourself a critic? You re announcing these things. Everything you just said can be and should be construed in the right way. She lets him do all of those things. She could&#39;ve complained to authorities, she didn&#39;t. She was in love with him. Toxic masculinity, seriously? What do you have a handbook that says movies should only depict nice guys and never grey characters? He doesn&#39;t pluck anyone out of that class. She comes willingly as well. Shame on you. You just lost all my respect
Report this video in numbers<br>And rajveen masand insta ac

Nikl mote , pahli fursat m nikl😆
This movie is Bollywood’s highest grosser of 2019 till date. This love story is outstanding in every aspect. Rajiv really needs introspection about his views, values, approach and needs to do his job seriously.
Chup kar be lodu!
Salt and pepper hair guy🤣🤣😂😂
So mister masand now u hv become NApasand for most of now. U are in same shitty league as of barky kamaal khan. No more chkin of ur reviews. A small channel like Tried n Refused productions is centuries ahead of ur tiny understanding of films and it&#39;s technicalities. Stop doin movie reviews and watch ekta Kapoor&#39;s serials and bark.
These kind of reviewers should be banned.

Audience na bata deya teri aukad...
I think producer did not pay him for review otherwise he would give 5/5
Start reviewing doremon movie
A true review. This movie shows women as an object. Hero can kiss, scold, slaps, humiliate anyone and audience laugh. And then you will say why we are not teaching our boys to respect women. Yes we are teaching our boys if a girl say no to you point a knife towards her and rape her as hero did and audience laugh. If someone fight with you dont hit him first, hit the refree first and then hit that person as hero did and audience laugh. As an actor Shahid nailed his role he is one of the best actors of bollywood but the chachter he played is totaly giving negative message to the society. Rajeev is a critic and he done his job perfectly but the truth is bitter for most fans.
Paid review <br>Cz sandeep reddy cm fr south<br>N bollywood dnt wnt outsiders to take bollywood<br>My rating fr KS 4.5/5
Inhone sajid khan ki housefull movie ko 4 star diye the ... 🤣🤣🤣 Kaun hai ye log...Kaha se ate hai yeh 😏😏😏😏😂😂
Stop stop stop reviewing if you are here to show how good person you are. And how much you are hating bad qualities in Kabir Singh. You are fat you are abusing your own body. Your own self. So please start from there. Every human has good and bad sides. Just because you didn’t like his character the movie is bad WTF. Movie would have crossed 300 crores till now because of you pseudo critics it’s hampered its success a lil bit.
O.k.

Those people who acts genius glorifying this shit called Kabir Singh or Arjun Reddy doesn&#39;t feel how they will they will feel if they encounter with a jerk like the protagonist(who are really present in our society). The glorification of such character is the problem here

Man that must hav been most disliked review of any critic in India.
Rajeev bhul gaya Kya ki tu bhi AIB ke show mein Gaya tha!!!so much hypocrisy hai yaar tujhmein!!
Rajeev the movie which you&#39;ve rated 2/5 has collected 250 crs and people loved it. I&#39;ve watched Arjun reddy more than twice and I loved the emotion in the movie. I never see it as alcoholism and other. But you people are only stressing on that. I think its time you to jump as a news reader.. # rajeev I&#39;m rating you 1 out of 10 as critic
When Arjun Reddy was released were you grazing Sheep !?<br>You found toxic masculinity only now !? Goat
These people don&#39;t know whom to vote for or which movie to watch. Our future generations will laugh at us.
Keep it up Masand! And don&#39;t change. Your reviews are honest and to the point.
Believe me you are the pepper boy forever and ever after 😂😂😂😂 every movie review you give you will get called so by all the people &quot;SALT AND PEPPER GUY&quot;😂😂
Ye bhut jald mar khaega

Tu cheez Kya h be...
Rajeev Masand u have no credibility left. Toxic Feminism is what i can see in your dialogues. i guess its fueled by feminist parties. CNN-News18 get him off or else people would consider CNN is also promoting toxic feminism.
Who came here after watching kabir singh..And seen his review on super 30..Where one can see the like vs dislike ratio😂😂😂😂
People who are criticizing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kabirsingh">#KabirSingh</a> &amp; Sandeep Reddy Vanga, plz watch this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzwrNmIn8QQ">https://youtu.be/KzwrNmIn8QQ</a><br>This is called misogyny, toxic masculinity etc<br>Not what was shown in Kabir Singh
Parasite
Rajeev masand don&#39;t listen to all those obnoxious people who are calling u fat guy with salt and pepper hair. Ur criticism of kabir singh is spot on. It actually deserved fewer than 2 stars!
After watching this review have lost respect for critics.. Especially this cartoon called rajiv masand...i think this cartoon needs to be trained how to review movies... Learn something from this lady called Deeksha sharma who does amazing review of movies on you tube
Who are these idiots disliking a genuine review, where is India leading to..

Fat guy with salt n pepper hair...
Rajeev Masand is fat.<br>That&#39;s a fact. That&#39;s not objectifying.<br>If I talk about his abdominal muscles, pectoral muscles and thighs - that&#39;s objectifying.
Rajeev Masand se naam badalkar Rajeev Napasand karle kyun ki tu pasand nahi hai hame...

Sir I hope you take these criticisms lightly.I have been following your reviews for years now and I loved how you thrashed one critique who criticised &#39; Taarein Zameen Par&#39;. Now I liked Arjun Reddy(barring the ending),but don&#39;t have an issue with you criticising the movie as it&#39;s your <a href="http://work.now/">work.Now</a> these vulgar comments don&#39;t define you,your years of honest reviewing does.Hope you ignore these below the belt comments as there are many people,including myself who supports you and are inspired by you.<br>P.S.I hope you will be keep reviewing movies with more earnestness and honesty.:)
2 is a lot !
Fully agree with this review,  Kabir singh is offensive movie give ring massage to the society.
U didn&#39;t understand the film. I once thought wonderful critic. But ur not now u didn&#39;t see the soul of the film. Intense emotions of the film. U really attached to hero death in climax films. Guys please don&#39;t listen to this fool. If u want reviews go to live audience directly.

Be careful while giving reviews.. Talk about 24 crafts and performance of characters. No need to talk abt their roles, a movie will have negative and positive characters it doesn&#39;t mean that it is bad.
Kabir singh awesome acting + awesome presentation of scenes.  Bu i strory line is totally unimaginable, as a viewer if I didn&#39;t connect with film I cant feel it. Little disaapointed with story.<br>    By watching Kabir singh in every sequences it reminds me of different film and starting point it reminds me of Radhe and nirjala from tere naam. (Same). <br> And that friendship of Shiva and kabir reminds me of sanju movies scene.<br>   And in some places Kabir looks like Tommy Singh of udta punjaab.. <br>    And the ending was totally unreal. I was like what is happening.. but Shahid was awesome as an actor he was great. 😍😊😊😊
Audiens are the critics.. This review is completely a shit..
STILL TOUCHES 250 CRORE..KUCH TO LOG KAHENGE LOGO KA KAM H KEHNA
Well u are a fatty with salt and pepper hair...just Describing not obejectifying..sandeep you are a thug man.... 😂
I can give 0 out of 5 to your review...
Looks like sandeep ruined his career...
I am so disappointed by the rest of the South Indian brothers in the comments... You are just proving that you guys are just like Kabir Singh/Arjun Reddy and just glorified bullies/misogynists... Its so sad these are the &#39;examples&#39; of men in our culture and society
Sanjeev Reddy to fat guy with salt and pepper hair - &quot;teri keh k lunga&quot;😂😂
salt pepper guy😂😂😂
This type of review is sad truth that is happening in Bollywood industry. While reviewing the film includes, the technical things like screenplay, editing, music, direction and story of course. I don&#39;t think any of above mentioned is being mentioned in this fcking bullshit review. Calling himself film critic, that is not review this is his opinion on the story.  <br>Total crap
Film bana fir bol
Hat bey chal
20k dislikes shows that this fat guy with salt and pepper hair doesn&#39;t know how to review a cult. All he loves choli k peeche kind of movie or fir bolta hai ki Christopher Nolan jaise film maker India mei nhi hei. Some brilliant directors are cornered in the field of creativity just because of our censor and dumb reviewers like him. Watch Sacred Games, the amount of  violence,  objectifying, cussing or yaha taq ki multi-gender dikhana and still successful hona show karta hai ki content achaa hona chahiye story ka chaahe creativity dark ho ya na ho.
Crap review
exhibit c ....salt pepper on sofa....instead of onions
250 crores and still going strong.... Pls go get a life people are not fools.. noone now cares what u say...
I loved the film.
My review 0.5 out of 5 for your review
nice &quot; <b>character</b> &quot; review... now make another video reviewing the <b>film</b>
Sandeep reddy be like &quot;Nikal laude, pehli fursat me nikal&quot;
You see the likes and dislikes ratio of this video. That speaks your criticism level..
200 cr ke upar gay tera review rere pass hi rakh
Sun be budhe tu sathia gaya hai aukaat nahi hai teri review <a href="http://dene.ki/">dene.ki</a>
Watch the movie again with full focus nd empty brain..... perception is what difference Rajeev sir
Kabir Singh is the best cult film i ever saw in bolywood
Finally you didn&#39;t know that, this is a fictional character and more over this is an movie that&#39;s it, as a critic you didn&#39;t talk about acting,charecters like shiva,that friendship,camera work,production values,songs,background music,screenplay,then  how can  you call yourself as a critic 🤔
Sir, <br>There is a song, &quot;Tere honton se main shabnam churaunga&quot;  ( Sadak- Tumhe Apna Banane Ki Kasam)<br><br>Is it same as Kabir &#39;plucked her from class&#39;??
“Fatty with salt and pepper hair” <br><b>Quote of the year</b>
I guess issne film nhi dekhi n he didn&#39;t even said anything pros about of this movie.. How biased reviews..
I want interview among SRV (Arjun reddy/Kabir singh)and Rajiv ( fat guy.... abdominal rectangle)  wow.
Ok 😂😂😂 Just see the Like n Dislike ratio... 😂😂😂
How many are watching this salt and pepper guy after sandeeps interview
2 out of 5....mad man
Get some sense dude!
Chutyaa
This what happens when you dont pay these kind of assholes to criticize a movie in good way then they became gangsta😂 what he thinks about his self. But the slap or you call a bullet in head of this shitty gangsta was success of this movie. It was meant for entertainment not for showing kids how to love and how to deal with breakups do &amp; don&#39;ts. These guys  just can&#39;t handle some nice movies.
Good one Rajeev!
Rajiv Masand you are 0 out of 5. Mote.
No technical stuff , exhibit a ,b lol , salt and pepper, pluck , threat ...<br>Holy moly , Sandeep peppered Masand to whole new level
I just came here to dislike his video!
First time Rajeev exactly said what I felt after watching the movie
Best feeling is to see 20k dislikes on this video.

Stick that &quot;two&quot; up your arse....You sound stupid even after using all those fancy words...No matter what you say,it&#39;s just a movie....are you tryna say that people watch movies to learn  how to live?...it&#39;s a story between  two fictional characters kabir and preethi ...and not between every male and female on the face of earth....
Khud ku nhi bana ke dekhta ekhad movie 😂
Just jealous of south makers
Just a paid review by anti sandeep reddy or fat guy doesn&#39;t understand the movie...Worst review by fat uncle
Fat uncle....

The director has also shown the consequences of zero anger management, we must appreciate that fact as well. The criticism towards Kabir Singh is not healthy and the audience have proved it :) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bekhayali">#Bekhayali</a>
Who is this f***king idiot... Isko Kabir ke saath akela chod dena chahiye
Being a AIB participant you have no authority to questions  kabir singh... you are hypocrite and paid reviewer
I came here after SRV interview. <br>This fat guy needs to slim down to put his face into his arse.  Coz it will be quite difficult to bend😂
Fat guy 😂 with salt nd pepper hair
Like and dislike ratio speaks everything
These guys won&#39;t talk about Salman Khan&#39;s tatti films
Go watch the review of Sandeep Vanga in film companion on your review on KABIR SINGH.....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

After watching intelligent badass Sandeep sir&#39;s interview this review sud be deleted from YouTube mr. Salt n pepper fat guy💥🌶️🌶️
Did he bihearted the sentences he spoke. From the papers beside him..may be a single takes🙁🙁<br><br>Really talented salt pepper guy.<br>He should try for IIT advance paper. He tops in India.<br><br>Coming to review<br>I think he is paid much<br>All the words comes from only mouth not from heart🤔<br><br>Bollywood guys I&#39;m from Tollywood. Do you deserve such shit?<br>Even we had a shit named Kathi Mahesh previous and he has no address today for his misreviews.<br>Due to his over smartness in every discussion. Telangana government banned him from entering into Hyderabad.<br><br>Did you guys watch arjun reddy..do watch in Telugu (Amazon prime) <br>Vijay acted by his heart. <br><br>Shahid sir did his best. And magic came as same..<br><br>There are few more scenes Kabir Singh is edited. Funny moments with shiva and Shiva&#39;s father. <br>Missed it in Kabir Singh.
movie dekhe bina kaise koi review deta h.? motherboard...
Maakaboshda
Hi Fat guy
Sandeep Reddy Vanga to Bollywood Hungama : &quot;Acha English words, nice studio, color sab laga le, aspect ratio dekh le, 3 din baadh review kar le. Do they have balls to do that ?.. No they don&#39;t. &quot; 😎 wannovo woon wanaa woon wanawon... 😂😂
Kabhi kushi kabhi gham is good for you
This guy is clearly attacking the film, look at his description in the beginning
oh my goodness, he is crazy ... thankfully no one cares for his review
Your a blody fat guy...  if you have that much talent.. why you reviewing and postmortem all films, go and direct which you feel good movies... salt and pepper guy😜😝😎
Salt &amp; Pepper 😅
He is a paid critic, he don&#39;t even know the art of moviemaking..........!!
Tumara BAAP agaya re SANDEEP REDDY.  if you have balls do your review after 3days  by Sandeepreddy 🤣🤣
First see. The dislikes😂😂
Hey Raju..<br>Did u see the number of dislikes??<br>Hshahahaha
As a reviewer you are expected to emphasize on Acting, cinematography, direction, dialogue delivery, and maybe little of story as well but not the characters only. <br>You are judging a movie out of character and that&#39;s it? <br>Like me and so many others looked Kabir Singh ( Character) just like a flawed character but you guys are shouting heroism. We know it&#39;s not heroism you dont have emphasize. <br>I watched your review before movie and for the first time I thought of you as Nonsensical.
Why this guy is called an reviewer. Thats the fate of bollywood
Uncle ko passa ni mila review dene ka.. Chidh gya.. Salla 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
<b>**Fat Parasite**</b>
Thank you for your review - I have Unsubscribed :)
Awww .. you should stick to reviewing  Disney  movies ...  Very realistic
Emotions Doesnt Need Ratings or Reviews.Just Feel Them!!
Very honest and true review.

Bull shit ,hi fi English

Rey Yaar thera 2/5 rating kaise 300Cr+ running ho raha hey .... :P
Just go and check how many people are not agree  with your review, better you should stop reviewing the movies... May be you  love mass masala, over exposing, unnecessary fight movie concepts so this movie is not for the people like you...
Hello Salt and Pepper ... U Got a Great Response Man
sandeep never mention that kabhir singh is a good person in the  film, he just told a story of a anger guy. and rajeev first learn how to watch films after that concentrate on writing reviews u r threat to IFI.
Here After sandeep reddy interview ...fatty. .salt and pepper hair guy 😂😂😂😂😂
Bhai tu zindagi bhar bakchodi hi kartey rehna.... aib roast mein jab participate kiya tab sharm nahi aayi tujhey.
The film is a blockbuster...<br>Who cares your review and stars..
It is not necessary that every film will come to seduce socially to people. I also find some bad points in a film but this is not the way to rag the hard work of team. And calling yourself as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23terror">#terror</a>_of_critics.
😂😂😂
From now on.. give a dislike to his reviews.. Let&#39;s teach this useless critic a lesson 😊
😂😂 tho abb isey aur kaisey movie chaheyy bahii ...worst review ever seen iseyy tho Bollywood main kalank jaisey movie chaheyeyy shayad pityy on you  salt pepper boy
Ha ha Came after Sandeeps Interview But it looks like they have been paid to talk about something else . when movie starts it says all the characters in this movie is Imagenative then y u need to criticize the character. If u have got money and balls for script and direction do it. can you loose your weight and can you also compromise 🤣🤣🤣
Paid review hai kya???<br>So u r the reviewer here ...<br>U r explaining scenes before telling the plot or the story itself ,Man !!!
Sandeep Reddy Vanga from Warangal Remember the name 😂😂
It was good as movie you can&#39;t rate it 2 out of 5 but somewhere morally you can question it.
Is review ko dekh ke maine bhi socha movie itni acchi nahi hogi.. <br>      Par movie bohut bohut bohut acchi hai..  👌👌<br>Jisne yeh movie nahi dekhi woh zarur dekhe.. <br>Fan ban jaoge..  👌<br>Or is motu ki baat mat suno.. 😂
We support SandeepVanga. This is a film buddy. Chill 🤟
First look at the way you sit ! Like a fat child
Salt and pepper hair
Fat guy
OMG Here Everyone Enjoying Salt and pepper 😂😂😂
I didn&#39;t know this Salt and pepper guy 😂😂 before sandeep reddy vanga interview
Can u speak something good about kabir singh?  Etna hatred kis baat ka hai?  Pesa diya hai kisine gaanda bolne ka?  Or u Bollywood people r afraid of someone coming from South nd earning more money than u?
Thank u rajeev for your brutal honesty in these misguided times.
<b>South Indian directors always think if the film does well.</b> It creates more work in the industry from light men, fighters to Hero. <b>That&#39;s how South director feel it is job satisfaction in creating more employment daily wage who are associated with cinema.</b> Less importance to <b>Box-office</b> Collection.
<b>He will never mess with Sandeep reddy again.</b> He ripped Rajeev critics. <b>Don&#39;t ever think south indian directors are not up to the Bollywood standards.</b>
One man single handedly trashed entire film critic fraternity. 20k+ dislikes Hmmmm
You fat guy &#39;salt n pepper hair; u don&#39;t deserve to be a critic, u should resign from this job after Kabir singh huge success!!
I came here after watching Sandeep&#39;s interview as I was curious what this fat guy is pooping out...
EPITOME of perfection
Critics should keep their political views aside. They should give honest unfiltered reviews.
Bean bag with salt and pepper hair... lolz🤣🤣
I loved the film Kabir Singh and I do not agree with this person Mr. Rajeev massand And I am also not happy with his reviews and criticism shown towards this film Kabir Singh and I am also not happy with the ratings which Rajeev sir has given to this film, I think he has never seen a real love story or had never heard about any deep love story like this.
Fat guy with salt and pepper hair!
Rajiv masand high on weed!
Salt and pepper hair  guy
Bhai... Khana Kam khaaa... Dhyaaan. Body pe rakh.. movie ke review me nahi...  Aur English bhi Kam kar.. Hindi me tho bol..... Tera2/5 review dena. U don&#39;t have right to rate.. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ayasalaratingguru">#ayasalaratingguru</a>
i jst came to see fat guy with salt n papper hair ..wow nice 😂 😂 😂
after watching his interview with anand kumar i totally rate his reviews irrelevant and paid
See the collections at box office fat boy..... Who the hell are you to give rating.... Do u have knowledge make a film.... Don&#39;t give review fat  boy
How much did u get paid for giving such review???
Hey Fat guy with Salt and Pepper hair, the movie was made so that you hate the protagonist who has anger issues and is chronic alcoholic. <br>So if you felt that way, means Sandeep and Shahid did their work perfectly. Box office collections of this movie is a slap to your 2* ratings.
Fat guy with salt n pepper haistyle !
E mote vese chup ho ja. buffalo
@rajeev Masand kabir singh superhit. evn people knw what kind of person u r.. audience ne tere auukat batayee hai aur uss aukat ku jaan.. kabir singh ke director&#39;s vision pe qustn mark mat kar baap hai wu tera.. aur thoraa apnee stomach pe dyaan de sahi rahegaa tere liye....
Really strange you fat badass to rate 2/5. You can make a film and try to impress the audience?
🖕🏻
sir it was just a film of one of the kind . you know in disclaimer they will mention that all these are fiction characters . what do you think .why do they mention? . i have seen your reviews but in this i feel like you took this film so personally as if preethi is your daughter if you see this comment then do reply for this question when in so called item songs heroin will be in middle with a very short dress and dance with all men around they are no issues but when a character like kabir does something why it became so <a href="http://judgemental.so/">judgemental.so</a>, everything  in films is  for films and will stay only in films . why you missed this logic
Aap apne balo ka dhyan rakho or review karna sikh kar aao aata jata kuch nahi or review karne chala hai
Loser fat guy with salt and pepper hair
chill.... its a Generation gap.... This Movie for Adults..... not for Kids(Means Mentally... Not Physically)  and old age People.....
Fat guy found with salt n pepper hair
I came here to see salt 🧂 and pepper hairstyle of a fat guy who reviews movies 🎥 and how audiences believe him..!
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sandeepreddyvanga">#SandeepReddyVanga</a> is probably the Best Story Teller in Today&#39;s Indian Cinema. With his recent interviews he literally shut down these so called film critics who knows nothing but blabber around. The Honest Story Teller Sandeep bhai ney in logoki dukaan bandh karvadiye

sandeep reddy should have taken rajeev masand as kabir singh&#39;s friend .. definitely i bet preeti would never come back in kabir&#39;s life ... ! film should be seen as film not as characters they potray ..blunder review!
Fat guy

Hi fat guy!!!<br>What exhibits are you talking about! <br>You are explaining your perception about a Character than a film<br>You apt to be a politician who speaks baseless points rather to criticise a film<br>Where are your points about 24 crafts<br>At least 2 crafts?
Absolutely shitty negative review
Kya re Kaali mirch namak wale mote
Bhadwaa
He gave 3.5 stars to Sanju.. And now doing bakwas for Kabir Singh... So much Hypocrisy why??????
Fake and hypocrite critic of bollywood. Tier 2 and tier 3 city and small town walo ko ghanta fark nahi padta in fake critics ke reviews se. Fkuc off.
Nikl lvdee pehle fursat se nikl
Pillsbury aata....touch his tummy<br>Pom..<br><br>Pommm...🤣🤣🤣
&quot;review the movie after a week &quot; open challenge thrown by Sandeep Reddy vanga cuz no one gives a shit after one week to  Mr. Rajeev masand
I want to dislike this video multiple times.... but how...????
Nikal lore
the impact this kind of film on youth is very worrysome....cinema is not just entertainment.....it had a  huge impact on the mentality on the society especially youth and children. do we want all our youth to act like kabir singh!
Real threats to film industry this doesn’t even knw hw to watch movie and give reviews to society 😝 This blockbuster success may them make real jealous as the director is coming from different territory like southern  nd new to hindi movie industry, A new comers movie is getting good responses and film is unreachable to other bollywood gaints box office collections definitely they’re targeting to degarde this movie.. but whatever stars you give that doesn’t matters. we love this movie and this director.. U just go to hell.
I think he got likes and views because of Sandeep&#39;s interview with film companion 😂
Go drink some milk kiddo
This uncle is Bluto in Popeye show...Sandeep reddy is Popeye!
We all have anger issues, we all get into violence, its not all warm and loving in real life like the Disney Movies, stop promoting shit....
Salt and pepper
U no smtg u remind me of a unmatured nerd who vomits wt he mugs up from books, but u dnt even hv tat basic knowledge of matured mind
Hey dude u reviewed his movie ,he reviewed ua review and u too
Never heard of this guy before. Fyi Rajiv vanga just got u famous. U can atleast give him that because he don&#39;t give a shit about Ur rating. Stop being partial.
Kya bakwas kar rha hai ye??? Rap scenes,ppl fucking whores wo sab problem nahi hai???
If he is talking about consent, then let me make one thing clear that if preeti wouldn&#39;t be interested in him , then even Kabir Singh himself couldn&#39;t have done anything. She was clearly into him from the very first day. Consent doesn&#39;t always have to be loud. This is common sense.. people like u are unnecessarily making it anti-feminist behaviour.
Please stop being critic, old age thinking will not work in 2019. 2 out of 5 Lol 😂🤣 😃😄 😅😆
Hit like if u dislike the video😂😂
That fat guy pepper  and salt hair 🙂🙂🙂 sandeepreddy vanga roasted  this pseudo  critic like  a boss 😂😂😂😂
I think , these all your feelings , why are you saying like - this is film review ...<br>I you never know, how to watch the film. First learn that, then comment.<br>THIS IS MOVIE IS BLOCKBUSTER &gt;.... Thats it..
2 bhi nahin half dena chahiye tha
Honestly at its best
Great great great review
So happy that the some courageous people are putting honest reviews
Sandeep  has already said this film is not for kids! Kids in the sense kids from brain! And if you ask these old uncle&#39;s to review a youth craze movie, tell me what can u expect more then this from this fat, salt and pepper hair uncle😂
I&#39;m glad that I don&#39;t know vocabulary as much as you do<br><br>I haven&#39;t liked Arjun Reddy but I like Sandeep vanga <br><br>I think movie processes too much of salt n pepper in it
Band karo saale ka channel
Mota aadmi with namak and pepper hair 💇 lol

The music is to die for.. U mizsed that. Yes its very patriarchal and in no way a man is allowed to touch a woman without her consent forget about beating her... Just some of the movie take u to another zone! Kiara is wasted. Shahid is very good. 3.5 would be a rating dude! Rest such movies can send wrong signals to roadside romeoes that this is what love is. Hit the woman, drink, take drugs, hit ppl n abuse law.. Which is sad.
Lol 8.4k likes and 19k dislikes tells you exactly how many fucks are given to his opinion for this movie. Brah! Why are you throwing so much negativity? 2/5? So generous. Look who cares? Nobody.
Rajeev 2/5 stars is going to haunt you forever just like 3.5 stars to &#39;Befikre&#39; review by Anupama Chopra haunts her even now and then😂😂😂
I&#39;ll give your review 0/5
Deserve more dislikes...😠
Pathetic review seeing how the film turned out to be a hit. Is this a court, wtf u saying exhibit lol. Plucks her out? No respect for women, is she a flower to pluck out. So you don’t like the character not the film. If you want a hero who is a saint, loving everybody and giving away everything he has earned and starts begging on roads. Please make a film like that with your money and see how it turns out. This fat salt n pepper hair guy gets 0 stars from me.
Silly salt and pepper guy...u r not even worth of giving critics ..
Kabir Singh has anger issues.. he obsessively and passionately loves a woman... but because of his anger he loses his gf.. then only he becomes alcoholic, drug addict and crazier because he can not get over his love.. but in the end he decides to work on his anger issues, give up bad things etc.... the film clearly shows how anger destructs a life of a person, his career, his health, his love,... this film nowhere celebrates the &quot;wrong things&quot;...  People are loving this film because he is shown problematic and realistic... Also its not new that alot of woman falls for &quot;bad guys&quot; or problematic guys because they think they can fix them.. also they like the &quot;protection&quot; these angry guys give... this film shows alot of realistic characters and the audience sympathises with Kabir Singh from start to finish...
nikal lavdee pehli salt pepper daalke nikal...
Achaaa he is the person who sandeep Anna  described about  . We telugu people only know katti Mahesh as critic but now I see his elder brother here
Gende 😂😂
What&#39;s &quot;PLUCK&quot; her out of the class? Is she a flower or what? - Sandeep Reddy Vanga 🔥🔥🔥

Who cares your rating,just support talented directors <br><br>Because many people lifes will be under one film dont spoil with your false reviews <br><br>It effects box office collections
Hey Fat guy, do you really know to appreciate a good movie or you just review a movie for the people who pays you well... just grow up and stop judging a movie like a movie, connect it with reality and then give a logical review... Son of a bitch
Report this video
Why you start giving moral lessons its just a movie <br>And I hope you know what a movie is
I think rajeev has  not had good time in his clg so he is jealous with the movies

Disliked and unsubscribed
u hv zero knowledge to gv a review on this masterpiece movie understand the movie first ur 2-stars turned now into 200+ cr
So much hatred this guy has on the movie..
Looks like fat guy did not get his Rs 2 lakh (for a positive review) from Sandeep Reddy Vanga. {As per AIB Roast, Rajeev Masand asks for Rs 2 lakh per positive review}
Just came after watching Sandeep sirs interview
This is not how you review a movie.. you moron! You are reviewing the character in a story, not  the way a movie is made.. how stupid!
Now u got more negative points on you than your stupid review mr. Fat -salt n pepper heap
i give  -0.5/5 rating for ur review...
Ja na mote ..
sahi kaun hai pata nahi<br>But ye fat guy Ratta maar ke baitha hai🤣🤣🤣
Raees= 3, sanju =3.5 and this gets 2. What will be super 30 God knows. This guy is a hypocrite.
Fat and fatter😂
Mr. Rajeev, your carrer is over. Go be a pseudo feminist somewhere else. Take care. ✌️
Backboneless fatty !!!! Go get a life !!! 😂😂🤣🤣 Can you ever be able to make one film??? Or just sit with such a big belly saying such negative sits !!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23shame">#shame</a>
It is a fight between critics review vs audience review... and you know what sir, your review has been raped by audience review by making Kabir Singh a blockbuster.. lol 😂 <br><br>P.S: now go and give a review on my comment because I used the word ‘rape’
Congratulations! You just got famous overnight because of Sandeep vanga Reddy
Shame on salt and pepper hair guy.
Masand mujhe ni Pasand 😆😆😆😆
You became a joker now after huge success of Kabir Singh!
M sure he will always think twice while adding salt’n’pepper  to his food 😂
I would love you more Rajiv if you changed your mind and gave the movie ‘zero on five’.
Rajeev, his name is Sandeep Reddy Vanga remember be careful.
Just came to dislike

The no. Of likes and dislikes proves that this fat  man is so full of himself and his salt and pepper hair

This guy should be himself made understanble of his own bulshit criticism. Salt n pepper fat guy
Stop Giving Hatered in the name of Film Review, People like you can&#39;t Digest that a South Director has stepped into Bollywood with Huge Success

Salt and pepper hair

Worst review to such a great film...
Salt and pepper hair motu😂😂
Unsubscribing this channel
Arjun reddy and Kabir Singh are both the movies that changed the Indian cinema into next level,that salt and pepper guy likes only routine movies
Take this guy out. This review is such a bullshit.
This is outrageous,  you cannot objectify like this. Let audience judge the film.
Rajeev- why do you sound more gay than karan johar?
It&#39;s a movie not a real story .fatty
Krk is better than u
Fat guy with salt and pepper hair
I came here after watching Sandeep&#39;s interview with Anupama &amp; Bollywood hungama... Seriously what kinda reviewer Masand is... He didn&#39;t talk about any other aspects of the movie. Seems like doing attack on the movie with personal mind. Throwing hate on the movie. Laanat hai  masand tujh pe. if it was done by your fav rk or ranveer you would have gone gaga on this movie. Biased idiot.. btw salt &amp; pepper hair guy. 😂👍
Salt and pepper 😆😆
Film review is about acting, cinematography, lighting, action, art etc... So many crafts.. U have not mentioned even one.... Lost respect on u...
Salt &amp; pepper hair uncle likes to criticize others movies but cannot take any criticism on himself.
Budhah saala,  love Story kya samajh mai ayega
Fat guy and salt pepper.

Fat guy with salt and pepper hair
Salt and pepper guy...
You need to shut up Rajiv.. Worst crtic
Masand hua Napasand. 😆
Came after watch Mr. Sandeep&#39;s Interview where he calls Rajeev the fat guy with salt and pepper hair!! Lol He also said no matter how good English  you use or colour correction done doesn&#39;t matter. Mr Sandeep is so right. These so called people from the bollywood industry consider their birthright to out needle the ones they don&#39;t resonate with! I really loved the movie so did the population of India that&#39;s why it&#39;s crossed the 200 crore benchmark. No one gives a damn about your opinion or so called &quot;review&quot;.Just look at how many likes you&#39;ve got vs dislikes &amp; now they are trolling about you!!
He is not MBA student😂😂😂....he is doing mbbs
Just came to dislike the video
Look at ur face before reviewing..
that fat guy..your review matters nothing in film&#39;s box office..
Ha ha came here after sandeep interview with anu😊 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sandeep">#Sandeep</a> Reddy vangha🔥🔥🔥Fat guy😂😂
Shutdown your channel. You don&#39;t know anything. U didn&#39;t understand the movie at all.<br><br>I guess, those how subscribed this channel, they will unsubscribe immediately.
Fat guy with salt &amp; pepper hair. <br>Pseudo/parasite
This fat guy with a salt and pepper look is a threat to the film industry 😁😁
Just here to check out the dislikes
Fat guy chl nikal*<b>**</b>
200+ crores for 2 rating. Just Wow
Just came to see fat guy with black paper hair😃😆😆😆😆😆
Fat guy with a trash mouth 🤣🤣🤣
Fat guy with salt and pepper hair😂😂😂
This is absolutely one sided man...I agree with Sandeep on the part of bad review....you are saying only a scene and telling it is bad, but not about why he does that or the entire scenario nor did you speak about other crafts.... I do agree that reviews and critics like you do a lot of damage to the film...I hope CNN takes care of this in future....you can&#39;t say any meaningless shit you can think of....next time please be careful with your reviews and thoughts. The number of dislikes also speak about this. And on the part he (Sandeep) says you are fat...I think he has controlled lot of anger inside him and spoke because he is speaking in public. I also think critics should be certified by a board (cbfc or something), rather than self declaration. Hope big people in film industry take care of this before it&#39;s too late. It would be also better if you apologize regarding this or better do a debate with Sandeep.
Please.. its a good movie.. appreciate the acting Sir!! n I hope you understand this is a remake.. so story is just the same.. its about acting that we were looking for.. and thanks to Shahid.. he delivered it excellent.. n I am sorry if you refer movies as your textbooks..  2/5 just for these scenes.. then I should you should have given the remaining 3 stars after seeing the complete movie and appreciating the acting..
What is up salt pepper hair🤣🖕
Always vomit when you are alone in a studio just keep someone good actors with you atleast we can listen them or just dont give worst Review.Just watch bollywood hungamama interview of sandeep sir.Ussi ka asar hai abtak.
Completely agree with motu , Kabir Singh is shit

Lodu sala laddu 🖕
saala gudwa
Fat guy with salt and pepper hair 😂
Is this guy out of is mind, do you even have a positive thought. This review seems just a personal attack to demolish the film. This review shows the movie in a very negative aspect, which it isn&#39;t.  Rajeev no good words for you.
Out of your mind&#39;s..
Is there a button called strongly dislike?
And what about the movie Sanju!? Mr. Rajeev!? What about that movie? Where you only talk about the good things about Sanju? I am not supporting Kabir Singh, no! But dude try and be fare! You have no right to talk about right and wrong if you don&#39;t really follow it!
Like and Dislike Ratio is staggering.
Great movie
