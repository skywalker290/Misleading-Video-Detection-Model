No one can hate them
I love when he said this award is dedicated to Irfan sir and his voice got so emotional. Such a genuine person
It&#39;s good that ott awards are genuine
❤
This should be the actual filmfare ❤️
Haryanvi
Dedicated to Irrfan Khan- well that sums up everything 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Well deserved
Why this discrimination with them why not the keep award like bollywood mafia 🤔
The best thing When your wife is taking your pictures
Ak 47....rocks
4 months since this video released on u tube and appx 45k views... m sure agar ye main stream movies ki award show hoti jisme nanga nach hota he and zhandu actors ko award milta he that would have got several million views by now... humare desh ke logon ki choice hi ghatiya he...
Poora batch hi talented hai
At last we see talent on stage,Now commercial movies are not so popular. OTT is the new big screen and we have awesome talent in OTT.Few big screen actors have also redefined cinema like Rajkumar Rao, Ayaushman khurana and many more.
Asur has been amazing bad decision
Very happy. OTT Platforms are the best places to recognize some of the best talent of cinema
Times are changing.Hardworkers strugglers and ordinary people getting their dues because of this OTT platform.The only positive thing in this lockdown.
Perhaps the only award which is genuine
Thank god he didn&#39;t said ..benchod in the stage..
Jaideep Ahlawat,  Manoj Bajpayee,  Nawazuddin, Rajkumar Rao, Rahul Bose, ...the list goes on and the room is filled with pure talent.<br><br>Missing Irrfan Khan, Sushant Singh Rajput...<br><br>Now this is what you call a true awards function!
Best Director Award deserve karte hai Oni Sen for Asur...<br>Mind-blowing writing and direction tha..but wahi hai Ye awards hamesha unfair hi rahenge...No doubt pataal lok bahot achi thi.. but Asur mere liye pataal lok se kahi aage hain..<br><br>Asur was the best series of 2020
He&#39;s a very good actor no doubt.. But Asur was more deserving than patal lok.. Filmfare just given all awards only to amzon and Netflix series/ movies..
Jaideep Ahlawat says I dedicate this to Irfan Sir 🙏🏻 and tears came to his eyes . I think the whole bollywood is smaller infront of these talents
Married men has thank their wives 🤣
Really best performance in patal lok
Everyone is cheering for each other 🎉🔥no jealousy or fake emotions 🙏
Best award... Genuine award show... Well deserving.. Atleast filmfare have understood n recognised the contribution of such talented actors who have kept the film industry going on...
