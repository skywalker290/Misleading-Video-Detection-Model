Imagine those hard working middle class students who prepare for JEE, NEET and other competitive examination........ No matter to which religion we belong whether its Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism etc when we are middle class people respect each others religion, culture. We stick only to our parents&#39; earlier hardships and try to crack exams. We forget to go to family function in X, XI and XII and these starkids take drugs in parties.......... We dont make any girlfriends but these cheap starkids parents themselves are involved in extra marital affairs. <br>We respect our elders...... They split on thier elders. <br>We respect feminism.......... They do shits for pseudo-feminism<br>We middle class people if suffer from cancer, we understand our financial loss but never ever do any bad things.............. And these nepokids, they take drugs no matter if they are cancer patients or not.<br>For our education, hunger and thirst our parents even die..........Though belonging to rich parents they are still X, XI and XII failed. <br>We know how to study......... They dont know even that except English<br>We NEET aspirants........... Yes I am a NEET aspirant......... We NEET aspirants always forgets all GF and BF relations but these people they have a lots of GF.......So shameless<br><br>We are Middle class people and I am proud to be a middle class person.

Firstly speak properly. Don&#39;t bad mouth a woman even if u don&#39;t like her actions. You don&#39;t know her personally so don&#39;t say dumb things or make comments like &quot; Without any restrictions &quot;. Give respect or don&#39;t make contents like this....
Really never heard Indian celebrities kids like top Doctor, Army, Enginer Lawyers all social jobs , they  money for studies.. SAME job like parent like money and fame...
I am thinking that why are you interfering in their life. It is there life and it&#39;s there choice. Pls comment I am right or wrong
We are better kids of our parents than starkids
It&#39;s their choice..they are not your children you are no one to judge them...

These drugies have no future in India, Drug is not only harmful for health but also this money is used for terrorism, Most of the times you&#39;ll see these drugies taking side of anti India forces
All are hard Drug Addict.
Its so nice to see these kids this way.. if they are addicted and spoiled nothing more can be asked 😜. Gutter mein kide hi peada hote hai and thats their lifestyle. Aise hi addiction mein aapne aap khatam ho jaye yeh log .. the way pappu is still stuggling and set an example of spoiled kid 😂😂😂
These guys hold a responsibility towards the people they should not do these things in public.
This is what happens when neighbourhood&#39;s chugli auntie is given a smartphone 😂

Furniturewala!😂😂😭
Shows what a shitty life they have they have to get drunk to enjoy it!!!🤮😂😂😂😂🤮
How Can Someone Get Spoilt<br>No one<br>Literally no one<br>Le Content Creator of this Video : All you&#39;ve to do is Lead A Luxurious Life, Go to Party and get drunk, dating with parter<br><br>NB : Hey  creator please grow up dude
I don&#39;t know about others but the information about ahaan panday and navya naveli nanda is absolutely true.
YouTube aunt
Furniture wala 😩😩😩😂😂😂😂😂😂
whatelse we can expect from them
Ibrahim is not a playboy
Where is sooraj pancholi?
Where Is Ranbir Kapoor?😂😂
What are the robes that these starkids are really spoilt if someone from outside does it then what you&#39;ll call them?
These YouTube channels spreading rumours to increase their views and subscribers.
I think Aarav kumar name is not to be there in the list because he is a national level taekwondo champion and his face doen&#39;nt look like he is an alcoholic.
First of all getting caught drunk doesn’t mean that they are addicted, which you basically said about everyone of them.<br><br>Second, when did dating people make people players or womanizer. Its there choice.<br><br>Third, its there money they can use it however they want.<br><br>Fourth, they should only be called spoilt if they did something bad using there money or their’s parents status for but what i see is that they are just living their life!
Yehh kuch jaada hi bolta hai. Itna mat bol.
They all got these habits from their parents..what&#39;s new.most of them come from rich ill educated families with no family values and no social responsibility
How tf those drinking make you spoiled?
Jhanvi kapoor isnot spoiled
You have given Sara Ali Khan &amp; Janhvi Kapoor in your title but actually they are not in this video
Starkids ko dislike kare bhailog.....
He,s saying right jaise tum ho nhi waisa logo na hi dikhao toh acha bahar se kuch aur andar se kuch aur even srk said in a show if anyone kisses my daughter i,ll slap him so what&#39;s this I know it,s their choice 😂
These kids will never become film stars ....nobody will like them as on today
Kamina saala
Furniturewala? Is that even a real name? 😂😂😂😂
it is actually Aarav KUMAR and Nitara KUMAR......if not KUMAR then &#39;BHATIA&#39;
Very bad state of star kids
Partying and having a few drinks doesn&#39;t make a person alcoholic and spoiled
Aree don&#39;t say like they r our so called future superstar. Those are star kid born with silver spoon. They never struggle in their life time but we who labour hard use to struggle to put our toe in this industry
She is just giving a entertainment video
Anayana panday.. Worst. 🖕🖕
They can all party in hell one day. Wonder how they&#39;ll &#39;buy&#39; their way out of there! Born with silver spoon in their gobs the cunts
I’m sure Shahrukh Khan son using drugs.All of them spoilt brats
Jealous cz you couldn&#39;t make it?
Doing party and leading luxurious life doesn&#39;t make them spoiled. Everyone who has money enjoys luxury to a certain state. Even common rich people who are not celebrity. Please, this is the most ridiculous and laughable video I&#39;ve seen!
Smoky evening- spoiled kids of filmstars. <br>Tu sunn meri baat it&#39;s their choice.
Ibrahim Ali Khan&#39;s Father name???
Let me tell you something.. Drinking smoking doesn&#39;t make a person bad or good and it&#39;s not a social taboo. It&#39;s their choice they live their life as they wanted. And we don&#39;t care about their life&#39;s. Make yourself useful for something make videos  that make your viewers get something...this video is shit
How do one define being considered spoilt? If you were rich, like their parents,  then your kids will be doing similar things as what u have associated with these kids too. So stop stereotyping the Bollywood artist kids. They have the $ and they are given permission by their parents to flaunt it. If anything, the parents should also be held accountable for their act, if required.
Suhana Khan k bare mein kuch nahi 😯😯😯😯😯
what shit is this <br>a person who parties, drinks is not spoiled
Sara ali khan.... का नहीं बताया बे
we support kids star
You’ll don’t even know English 😂
Idiots don’t even know what sober means
They enjoying life , that’s what most young people do at that age
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axQ7g_2Mlxc&amp;t=148">2:28</a> ArhaN khan. Look alike arjun kapoor. 😂🤣
How can you people just state they all are alcohol addicts its just that they have never been restricted for such things its become a part of their lifestyle. Not all the youngsters are nowadays like this its just the influence of surroundings that matters. They would have seen drinking as normal thing so they have adopted that kind of lifestyle.
This shows upcoming actors or actresses are gng to be worse than now
What if u spotted any star kid boy with girls it is mean he is play boy😂
hahaha simple in face dangerous in hearth.😬
Ab chup baite na toh Suhana, Ira, Ibrahim, Aryan khans, Shanaya Kapoor, aur toh aur Taimur bhi guss jayega industry mein. put as many comments as possible on their videos as possible. It becomes negative marketing and ultimate message from the public that they are boycotted.
First of all that’s none of your business what they doing with their lives and second you keep telling each and every single of them a alcohol addict. If you can’t say something good then shut your mouth.
Are when the hell will you stop focusing on STAR KIDS<br>Also this work also you did’nt do well<br>Really pathetic
I hate star kids total waste for humanity 😡
What the hell.<br>You don&#39;t have right to post such content

Why you have put Sara Ali Khan in the tittle????????
Most of the star kidz are alcoholic <br><br><br><br><br>If you agree hit this like button
Drinking makes ppl spoils???? I mean seriously stop giving ppl a character certificate dum

Its their life... none of your business!🤣
Go and get a dictionary and see the meaning of SPOILT.
Living a luxurious life and drinking doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re spoilt ffs!<br>Like wtf u serious bruh?
Bhagwan ne kash mujhe starkid banaya hota

I guess we are nobody to say if being drunk is being spoilt too given they are doing it at the legal age, we don&#39;t know maybe the narrator of this video or the content designers may be also alcohol adict too....
Improve ur knowledge luxuries life didn&#39;t means only alcohol.. If drunken is luxurious then every sherabi in india is king
Agar ye video inke mum dad ne dekhliya to tumlog to 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Partying is not a spoilt nature
If a person drinks then they are spoilt 🤔 what a logic
If a person has a luxurious life does not mean they&#39;re spoilt. Maybe it is you who is spoiled
Sara is not spoiled
Jab celebrity stars ko koi problem nahi hai to tmhe kya hai <br>It&#39;s their choice and there life it doesn&#39;t mean they are spoiled
😐oye sun meri baat it&#39;s their choice .. 😂 judgemental aurat 😑
Just because they drink and party it doesn&#39;t mean they are spoilt. First know what u are talking about. They have their own way of lifestyle who are u to comment about it. Just because u are not star kid u are talking like this. If someone talks nonsense about u like this than u will understand
Leaving luxurious life is not wrong just because they are star kids don&#39;t talk as u wish. Have some self respect it is there life they will do what they ,  how are u to ask them or question their activities. <br>More than their ur activities you are stupid interfering in other personal life and making it public don&#39;t u feel ashamed of it. <br>U be proper first than talk about others
partying hard..drinking..isnt wat u called spoiled..i am sure u also do these..
Waise or koi actor actress bache bhi nahi sbka naam to le lia aapne.... Aapke kahne ka matlab hai ki saare star kids aise hi hain... Waise ek do naam me bata dun agar aap bhul gye... Kyoki bachhon ka to pata nhi magar star ka naam to aapne badnaam kr hi dia
Drinking alcohol makes you spoilt ?<br>Kya chutiyapa hai...many people drink just because they&#39;re star kids don&#39;t mean they can&#39;t.
Plzz first see abt Ur self before giving wrong information about othrs... See if Ur perfect first and stop giving wrong title and spoiling the name of good actresses
It&#39;s their choise!<br>                    - neha dupia
Kuch bi mtlb😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why sara??She is down to the earth
Tera baap ka toh nehi khata nah.... N They are not kids for your kind information 😂😂 they all are grown up..
I think you are feeling jealous of them as they are living a luxurious life      .      Those who agree hitlike👇👇👇👇
if anyone leads a luxurious life it is not that they are spoilt...
Being drunk doesn&#39;t mean spoiled kid for fucks sake
Please mind your own business
Bhai first u correct ur &#39;spoiled spellings&#39; because half of them r wrong..... Not only in this video but in other videos as well uske baad star kids n unke spoil hone ke baare mein sochna ya phir baat karna
They their personal life....we dont have Right to say anything to them....<br><br>After all they are not harming any one by their activities
May be u have a problem with whatever celebrities dp
Apne Sara Ali Khan aur Janvi Kapoor Ka nam caption me keu likha Hain<br><br><br><br>Sun mere baat It&#39;s her choice
You after all don &#39; t know them properly . Maybe sometimes they go partying but that doesn &#39; t mean that they are a spoilee brat .
Kuch bhi matlab.. alcohol &amp; party= spoil kid 🤣🤣🤣 pta ni aur kya kya dekhna padega quarantine mei..😂
Why did u bring sara &#39;s name<br>U guys always put wrong titles <br>Sara os my fav actor
You&#39;re too involved in other&#39;s life.
Clicking a pic with a girl doesn&#39;t mean they are dating
I dont think that it&#39;s wrong to party it&#39;s their personal choice and their life....so we dont have the right to interfere
Partying hard doesn&#39;t come in the category of being spoiled.
Yaeh  now  took  taimur ali khan  also  in this list
Put suhana
Title of your video is always wrong with many mistakes inside
Jao...sab kharap he..tum akeli acchi ho😤
Drinking and partying doesn&#39;t define a person...he or she could be an awesome person
None of them drinks these are roomers u just want content
so according to this a spoilt &quot;star kid&quot; is when the kid gets drunk sometimes and spends money. lol make better content.
When aryan khan playedI thought it was shah rukh khan
Big B&#39;s granddaughter is aradhaya and not navya naveli Nanda
All rubbish for views😂🖕
Sab khatam hai

Thoda atak matak ke chalne par hi kya yeh drunken state mein hai..<br>Akshay Kumar playboy hai yeh aapko kaise pata, he is actually a family man...
What’s with the partying?
The person above who is doing video is an idiot since when drinking socially is being spoilt , yes I agree some of those kids are spoilt but drinking is not the reason, or being in relationships ....
Becoming ther ward of a star was not their own choice ..... n after that how can they live a poor life While living  with a rich parents ? Such a foolish statements ! Its very very obvious they ll live a wealthy life !
Just love Sara ❤️ 😍
Alaya furniture wala . Very funy😂😂😂
Apne shaed in chijo main PHD Kar rakhi  hain agar starkids party karte hain wor unki photos girls ke sath ati hain toh asa nahi hain ki woh spoild hain
I think almost all star kids are spoiler if we believe smoky evening<br>For all of them they gave the same reason<br>This proves that all this is fake
Leading a luxurious life isn’t called spoilt!.... Improve your content
You could just name the kids as all are alcoholic according to you
They are living luxurious life &#39; cause they have money.<br>Why interfering in their life.?<br>Dates?  It&#39;s the age where almost all teens dates so it&#39;s natural.<br>It&#39;s their life and you don&#39;t have right to judge!!! <br>And stop adding unwanted names for fame - Sara, Janhvi seriously.<br>For Just views.<br>Please whenever you make new videos make it with sense, And REAL title&#39;s.
All drink so they are bad
You have spoiled👿

It&#39;s their choice.
Very bad... These celebrators before advising the people let them to do it for their own children .
Well this is their time enjoy how they want and it’s not very long life hits one very hard and teaches them to wake up and take responsibilities and learn to grow on your own after all money will not  grow for anyone.
How is being drunk being spoiled?
If drinkjng in parties and clicking pic with different other gender people is being spoilt then every teenager is spoilt.... Their parents are rich thats why all these kids are having that lifestyle.... nth is wrong in that.... if we also have same amount of money we would also spend it.... stop being sooo judgemental n try to get real news not this shit
parents are  making money...kids are burning money
Sara is not like that. Then why you mentioned her?
🖕🖕🖕
