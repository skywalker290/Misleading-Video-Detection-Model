okay so the interviewer during the intro was terribly nervous, he even fumbled, he didn’t make sense and still it looked normal because he had a smile.
The volume is very low.
Aamir you are also popular here in the Philippines because of your film 3 idiots. I started to appreciate your work in 3 idiots too and from there i looked for your other movies at you tube where i appreciated you the most.
I have history from north koria...so it&#39;s better to.....<br><br>I will ask Jacki chan

Count me in as your international hard core fan, Aamir 😍!
Mujhe dadhi aur much me Aamir passed nahi, bilkul nahi, hero ka roll chodkar carecter roll kar rahe ho, dev Anand ajivan hiro rahe, 1945to2011.tak aapne humari ummid per pani Fer diya, yaad rahe ham umar hain ham. 50 saal ka vyakti, Sharir aur dimag se Jawan rehta hain. Yaad rahe Aamir garib nahi hain.
The only actor who challenges Hollywood not on box office but with content and creativity that yes here stands India
Amir Khan looks like Amir jalota.  Almost like twins.

aamir khan is the real superstar
Biggest star in the world......
Mr perfectionist...........
Aamir, get rid of the beard and mustache, bro! You look more handsome without &#39;em!
Rohit is right;  Aamir is beyond Bollywood and #1 conversations; he is an international star now
What changes aamir is taking about bollywood is the most unorganized industry in this world not only lobbies and circle work here beside nepotism if someone had to pitch a good script in any production there in no way to communicate with anyone until u know someone somewhere unlike hollywood where u have agents and pitching a project is quiet easy there compared to Bollywood major reason Indian Cinema isnt growing coz there isnt a way to engage and connect with right people ive personally done a docu which was a semifinalist at Student Oscars last year but In india honest fimmakers dont count lobbies does hope amir khan makes a script department in his production who is reachable for filmmakers to pitch their projects.
Ndtv name ha interview mai english bol rahe ho hindi mai interview lia karo
