Love will fly away through windows if any man has no capacity of financial sustainability
God he looks like cocaine got the better off him. Sad.
According to Chanakya :-patni ki parakh kam paison mein .or we can say if husband has no money
Isiliye bolta hu Hindu ladkiyo inn mullo ke chakkar PE mat padho
Who are you guys to make a judgement ?<br>He isn&#39;t asking you to help him financially.<br><br>Honestly you don&#39;t know anything about them<br>and then start saying he is jobless, or she doesn&#39;t love him, etc.
He flopped flipper because reason is moody person over confidence over acting turn him down to this position now.
He is a looser
Inspired from Amir ek biwi choro dusri k sath jihad karoo
Money is not everything for divorce.exceptional cases witness poor people living in slums adjust in marital life.
Money will come and go . Rich could be poor and poor could be rice anytime but real man with good heart , character and nature is hard to find in this world
ups and down is a part of our life but divorce was not a right decision to choose..With love and supports every tough time will be end oneday but with depression and anger thats not possible at all..so pls hv patients and hv faith to ur luck but dnt get divorce it‚Äôs not a solution its a another burden in ur life...hope u both r back again in ur married + love life ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
Was it really money or his affair..??
Truth or dare?
But that&#39;s the way life is if u dont have money then definitely u r in big trouble.  <br>Imran should have looked for other career instead of hoping that he will make it big in Bollywood he is not a good actor.
Whatever is the matter...we just want him back..
When you have no money,love flies out of the window.
Its the best thing of this yr...Choosing a M*<b>SIM  for marriage...Be*</b> ki l** k saath acha hua...
Career is very important aspect in life....if you are failed to prove himself ..... whether u r good man .... All things r useless
Malaika Arora ne Arbaz Khan Ko kyu divorce Kiya.. flop career ? <br><br>ok.. toh Arjun Kapoor konsa hit actor hai.. ?<br>LOL.. chaddo yaar<br><br>ya toh logic galat hai ya toh reason kuch aur.. jo bhi hai it&#39;s ther personal life.. woh Sambhal lenge khud hi.. <br><br>flop aur hit toh chalta rehta hai.. itta save kar lo k ghar pe ladai na ho..<br>but in high maintenance lifestyle, very difficult.<br><br>isliye shampoo, toothpaste, cement bechna padta hai part time.<br><br>sab paise ka Khel reh Gaya aajkal.. love marriages don&#39;t take the pressure after 7 years.<br><br>pehle bank balance, <br>fir rishta aur last mey Dil toota hai..<br><br>hope their kids atleast grow in secure home env
Fake batien
Knew it üò≠
In short they marry for money not for man... both men and women nowdays ..
This is such a nonsense. Al the girls mentioned in the videos got together with their husband&#39;s when they had no career at all. Why would they leave them because of it? And hrithik was still acting when he separated from his wife. Stop creating such rumors. And ppl should stop listening to these stories
Bechara
Arey Imraan apnay Aamir mamu ko ek baar call kiya hota. Woh apnay film mein koi chota motha role de deta. Ohh wait: Aamir hardly does one film per year.
There are lots of examples in this world when the husbands did not have jobs the wives become their support like SRK he was nothing after marry but his wife gave him space moral support even in such situations wives also change their life style ..<br>Nonsense larki jab pyar keya tha tu kia wo super star tha üò° aur imran  ko bi chayea ghr free na rahe job search kary acting hi ek field nahi hai buss üò•
How many grammatical errors in this short clip. Go learn proper English first.
Their is no point to spend your all life with someone who‚Äôs not their when you need her the most. That‚Äôs why SRK is the king khan.
We cant say anything as we are not in their situations..hope they unite together ..bcs bad tym will not last forever ..
lol as mama as bhanja shut up media u dont know  what is going  on
If this Rich people leave their partner just for failure then we common people are much more better than those fake people. Imran has money he can do some other ventures or whatever he wants. My husband left 60000&#39;d job for doing business. He doesn&#39;t have any idea of business. He doesn&#39;t even know what business he will do. But instead of leaving him and ending my 7 year marriage I started doing job just to support my family so that the love of my life can do whatever he wants to do. I want him to live his life the way he wants. I&#39;m there for him. Thank God for not giving us so much money that we forget our relationships just for our financial insecurities
Why does Avantika have to depend on Imran&#39;s money or her parent&#39;s money for survival? Can&#39;t she work herself?? So typical!
So rather than getting separated..if Avantika loves Imran than she should have started some work to support Imran..y always boys have to struggle to feed the lady n family.. y not females? Its disappointing that she left coz of his failed career..!
dis generation has no peace of mind....without any patience nd true love.....money is deir true friend.,..nd everything....whereas Mallika is concerned she had everything a BIL who supported dem....but destiny plays a crucial role in everybody&#39;s life ‚úåüèª‚úåüèª‚úåüèª
Divorce because Imran khan is gay.
I remember there was a news, avanthika‚Äôs mother forced to imran khan to marry avanthika when he became success. Their marriage was suddenly happened and now they divorced by proving that there is no love n respect in their relationship at all.
Sahi h... In Susro ko Koi kam h Kyaa
Both need to work it out. I did like him a lot in Jaane tu ya Jaane na. Aamir could have helped him or he could take up a job he is really good at. But divorce shouldn&#39;t be the reason. I know it&#39;s not easy for a woman to handle everything alone her house, work, daughter it&#39;s overload but both should find out a way and support each other. Love and marriage is about being there for one another. It&#39;s not necessary to have a rich lifestyle but just sufficient enough to live together as a family. God bless them both and hoping they reunite:)
He shouldn‚Äôt classify himself as an actor as he has zero acting skills. He needs to find some stable job to continue living his normal happy family life.
Really sad.
Ye wohi ladki hae na jo pehle Ranbir Kapoor ki gf thi phir Sawaarya movie flop hone pe Ranbir se brk up kr li aur phir Jaane tu ya jaane naa movie hit ho gyi to Imraan ki gf ban gyi...
Mama ke jaise pehle 1 trial ball khela. Abhi dusri ke saath real match chalu hoga.
Why his uncle did not make a sequel of Delhi belly.. Aamir Khan should have helped him..
Both are good for nothing.
Money hai toh honey hai
Iss ki biwi ki koee persnalty hi nahi thi
No ladies should leave her husband for money <br>Money is not everything <br>Money can‚Äôt buy happiness
If the reason for divorce is Imrans Flop Career....... Than wat is Avantika..... A hit actress or a super model? ..... Lol.....
Oooh god. Which means if the husbands have money wives are happy and stay with them. If they have no money wives leave them. That‚Äôs sad. It‚Äôs all about üíµ
So sad..hope they will work things out quickly for sake of their daughter..üò•üò•
Get Genelia and Imraan to work together again
Imran khan&#39;s divorce..He was very mean minded and very Arrogant even when he was down in dumps..he paid the Penalty for his wrong Behaviour...He Is financially ruined...
Mama ka banja
When she left him only because he hasn&#39;t enough money, it wasn&#39;t love. Only when the times are hard, you can show if your love is strong enough.
Why ye log shade karte heyü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Their r not even cute couple.  The guy is so handsome n tall the lady is short n not pretty at all.
