Remembered sarika mam from 2018 today seeeing this in 2023....good 10 th days...
The clock looks modern
She was very intelligent but a con artist
Movie name?
amazing perfomance of vidya
Bsdk kuchh bhi mene socha koi chakar hoga lawde tune chutiya banaya sabko
Math is my favourite subject 😎😎
❤️❤️
This is God gifted talent, I believe in God . I don&#39;t like Shakuntala&#39;s life  because she has done nothing in mathematics atleast she should do some research in the place of showing in shows
Over acting overload
how did she know that boy&#39;s name is akshay
If we got the the teachers like her in school our childhood would have more  fun and intresting
Would attend every class of such a hot teacher
I miss my maths teacher
She deserve national award for this ...
Kash hamre bhi maths ke ase hi teacher mile

We also expect like these teachers in schools for maths
Prime is best
Mathsphobic person like me... Are watching movie of &quot;Shakuntala Devi&quot; 🧡🧡🧡🤍💚💚💚
She&#39;s super cool
Thank god it was deleted. 😂<br>And Thank god it is uploaded on YT 🤩
Love and respect to human computer ❤️❤️
❤️💚💙💛
This isn&#39;t a deleted scene ,it is the last scene
Ruined.
🤣
why they have deleted this scene ? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
😣
Class 4-5 ke baccho ko thori na mach ayega be🤬🤬🤬
I had a maths teacher like this last year she was super cool she solved all our doubts and. Had a great amount of patience the subject I hated the most became my fav and because of her help I topped in maths
Lol, I thought somewhere she would answer the question the kid asked.. <br>Of course maths has rules.
Vidya Balan Mam is such an exemplary actress
Ok so why 1+1 is not 4?
Why this scene was deleted?
Every reacher must follow this method n first of all encourage students so that they would become great n never forget his or her teacher n will always pray for teacher.
Good scene.. Why it was deleted?
Best Maths Teacher.
oo lala oo la la...
Please stop making fun of Bengalis.. bollywood only can bring these type of discrimination while making a movie on such an intellectual subject
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrPwrVdS9xE">https://youtu.be/OrPwrVdS9xE</a> 👈🏻 all about the legend Shakuntala Devi
Overacting
So sad from Vidya Balan ,teach acting course ,🤬😠🎵🙏🙏🙏
Shakuntala devi the greatest mathematician of all times
Uske nm akshe hain kase pata laga
I used to hate vidya. But after watching the dirty picture, I have a different kind of respect for her. She a gem in the whole film industry. Both her performance and looks are killer.
We want this type of teacher 😁
Every maths teacher should be friendly...hope
Name of the movie ?
I don&#39;t know about my maths teacher but my hindi teacher is like this
Me to yaha BODMAS rule pdhne aaya thaa 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Her smile is like Parineeti Chopra
Excellent film.......
X
my maths teacher is too bad too teach she sometimes keep her mouth shut there is online class
So cute
i knowed about shakunthala devi after seeing this movie
Biology master is made so dumb to make a maths teacher smart. It was unnecessary. Director should have been a bit more creative.. good that this scene is not in the movie
We have to make other characters dumb to make the main one cool?
She still didn&#39;t answer &quot;1+1 = 4 ho sakta hai kya?&quot;😂😂

Have you noticed the change in &quot;BODMAS&quot; <br>(On the blackboard)!!!???
It feels like I am in school
Accha hua ye scene nikal diya... itna overacting suit nai karta vidya pe aur film pe bhi
She was role model up to flims like paa, munna bhai,  later her graph came down crashing after dirty pictures.
and then there is my maths teacher who says to ask questions and when we ask a question they shout at us
Mathematics teacher from west bengal ☺️☺️
Vidhya....ur awesome.....😘😘😘😘

Mujhe bhi aise maths teacher chahiye.
just got a nostalgic feeling of my school days it was so similar <br>counting time before recess<br>eating tiffins during lectures<br>mam after recess period shouting that u all just ate food, no energy but who will tell them the dizziness we felt after eating tiffins and the boring history lectures :)
This scenes deleted i think puri picture hi delete kr dena chahiye.. internet se.. Bakwaas
Over acting

Overaction flooded....!!!!
As a teacher we are not allowed to sit on the table in front of the students. May be for this reason this scene was deleted.
Did any one observed in BODMAS he said O for order but that is Of
I wish Shakuntala Devi was my Mathematics teacher. 😢😢😢😢 Then I would&#39;ve been the topper in Maths not in class.
Lawda ka movie hai 😑
Vidhya balan is best than sharukhan

Chutiyaaaaaaaaa vidya balan
Even in 3rd standard i would feel cringe if some teacher talks this cheesy... Teaching in a intresting way is different from taking classes from dora the explorer
Overacting
She didn&#39;t answer the child questions though @1:98
I AM GOING BE SHAKUNTALA DEVI
Save money for the future

My holiness if I got that kind of maths teacher who should teach by Heart not from books
She was great &amp; fastest human calculator in that era... She wasn&#39;t a mathematician. There is a lot of difference between mathematician &amp; human calculator.
As an teacher you can&#39;t seat on desk in front of students like she seats.
Sorry but vidhya ki acting bilkul kharaab thi isme....plus the face makeup was very bad.
This Scan hardly osm better for this video I liked it<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZMMVtePvCo">https://youtu.be/XZMMVtePvCo</a>

So much overacting 🙄
Binod
She always gets good publicity  thanks to big banners backing her  even though very average or over acting but that is enough for indian stnd.
Good, this scene was deleted. Not entertaining.
ovaracting of vidya balan
I love vidya <br>Versatile actor and she is so so beautiful ❤️ she struggle so hard for what she is today
Batoore balan 😂😂
Vidya bhalan 😍😍😍😍stans here
According to shakunthala devis look and sound mayoori sudha chandran resembles best ..
She is a verstile actress.
Hiiiii♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
nice scene delete kyu ki
Super
Over acting
Shakuntala devi is not a mathematical genius she is a numerical specialist. She was expert in fast calculation of addition, substraction, multiplication and division of numbers and nothing else. Mathematics is a huge world of many more things including these basic operations. It is wrong to call her as mathematician, but the great Shrinivasa Ramanujan was a mathematician, no doubt about it. Shakuntala devi was a genius on numbers.
vidya bala acting not good overaction

why she hasn&#39;t answered his question?
Vidhya is overacting.
What if he writes Binod instead of BODMAS
Shakuntala Devi was not a mathematician stop representing her as a one
Please transfer into Tamil
So watch on amazon prime you won’t miss scenes this is not deleted
Teacher is Arnab
sorry❤️
Her body gives her chances in odd roles in films other than bollywood girls
Binod
Maths is my best friend 😃😃
This scene was deleted because of the bakwaas mathematics rule BODMAS<br>ye BODMAS nahi BADMASSH rule hai
Jab tak samajh aaye fun nahi aaye to bakwas like of you relate 😜😜😜😜
Stupid scene : 1) Is she a gunda to jump over the table to make her seated. A teacher should show a minimum decency  and be aware where to sit and how to sit properly <br>                          2)  The guy behind her , supposed to be the teacher, raised his hand in response to her question.... What a fool he is .... He is mocking the whole teacher community through this single foolish action
Why Bollywood does Overacting and makes a mess of every good character.
Sitttdowwnnn😁
I wish she taught me maths...

Dislike for Vidya who support drug activities
🙏🙏🙏
ye kya overacting karke rakhi hai.
The Dirty picture wali feeling aa rahi hai
Ye scene kata gya h movie se per kun kuch katne jaisa to nahi h
Shameful! Vidya, I don’t understand people like you who openly support prime accused while defaming or remaining silent on Sushant and his family. Sushant is dead. I repeat Sushant is DEAD. Someone’s son, someone’s brother was murdered. A life lost. And he was from your film “fraternity”. And not ONE word in support of the dead?! Who supports drug peddlers over a man that rose to great fame and had great aspirations for himself and his country? Shameful Vidya Balan!

Vidya, India will not forget that you sided with the oppressors. You chose to be on the wrong side of history. Dear daughter of India, Dear Vidya, please do not side with the privileged oppressors and support the weak/murdered. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywood">#BoycottBollywood</a> In losing SSR, India lost a national treasure, an exemplary human being, an academic, an epic actor, a true philanthropist, a jack of all trades. We, the Indian masses won’t stop until the entire criminal nexus involved in SSR’s murder from Bollywood to drug cartel to politicians to Mumbai police is publicly exposed, charged in court, legally prosecuted &amp; given death sentences. CBI must must must demonstrate their fairness in probe by concluding it with all the big and small fish involved in the murder exposed . <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23iamsushant">#IAmSushant</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#Justice4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23middleclassmatters">#MiddleClassMatters</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23reportforssr">#ReportForSSR</a>

Pass nahi toh fail nahi 🕺🕺
Oh wow! So much overenthusiasm....I&#39;ve seen a few different videos of Shakuntala ji and I can&#39;t see much resemblance in terms of behaviour and personality.
Back side wall clock showing same time... Video start to end
Vidya balayan is so sexy and her acting superb as shankuntala Devi madam
Vidya balan good acting
Vidya balan jayda noutangki or overacting kiya hain flim a <a href="http://jo.ki/">jo.ki</a> shakuntala ek intelligent and smart thi
Overacting killed many scenes.  The real Shakuntala Devi had an aura and charisma Vidya tried to compensate with her overactions and artificial smiles
Neither math&#39;s class  nor math&#39;s teacher has been this interesting during my entire school😁

Kaash hamari bhi teacher aise hoti
The bollywood movies based on true event , all are fantacy updated , it&#39;s all hyper exaggerated
Why my maths teacher was not like her 😁

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJfXbzunLB0">https://youtu.be/UJfXbzunLB0</a>

We should respect vidhya balan for her acting
Shakunthala devi is lagend
It&#39;s after the song then deleted scene  how is that possible this scene looks good but deleted hmm 😙😙😙😗😗😗💓💓💓💓
Vidya is not doing justice to Shakuntala&#39;s character. As far as I remember, she was a solemn lady here she is trying to be jovial.

Who cares just look at her how cute she is😍😘😘😘

why just deleted scene?? whole movie should be deleted!!
When I see Vidya Balan in this biopic I always remember Dirty Picture I don&#39;t know may she was portrayed in this biopic not like Shakuntala Devi how she actually is in real life. Please Amazon Prime make another biopic of her along the lines of Radioactive (Marie Curie&#39;s biopic).
This scene was not deleted it&#39;s in the end after the movie is finished.
Best of luck for JEE &amp; NEET

these serials always abuse south indians and bengalis and non-hindi people, shakuntala devi never spoke hindi, hindi people think they are the keeper of our destiny, which is not, they have very little contribution in the nation building apart from joining in army, most of the scientists are from bengal, south etc

Over acting
It is a bad habit of sitting a teacher on the table. It will create a bad opinion on the person
What do you mean there are no rules? Such stupidity. She would have never said it. Trash film
Very nice movie everyone should watch in my opinion... and we want many more Shakunthala  Devi from India to make India proud
Kash Shakuntla devi jaisi Maths ki teacher mujhe bhi mili hoti❤ Kya kisiko apni life mei  aisi teacher mili?
If Shakuntala Devi came to teach me Math, still I would remain dull in Mathematics. In this birth, Math is just impossible to me.
What an acting ! Only she can do that.
ye class kb over hogi ye madam class se kb jayegi ye calculate karna bhi to maths h....😅
By seeing this...I think a teacher must be like  very friendly with students 👍👍

Another superhit film by Vidya Balan! इसी तरह से अगर वे बायोपिक करती जाएँगी, तो एक दिन लोग उसे &quot;बायोपिक बालन&quot; बोलना शुरु करेंगे!!!
I have never seen a class room like this , when a teacher is inside the class room, all stupid directors show teachers as comedian or as immatured person. Stop these kind of nonsense here after.

Sushant Singh Rajput fans ,see &quot;Hypocrite Bollywood&quot;  showing their movies by titles of Deleted Scenes.<br>Bycott Bollywood.<br>Justice for Sushant Singh Rajput 🙏
Seeing her body language it looks like Dirty picture sequel .. does not justify the role of mathematician Shakuntaladevi
Osm movie
Badhia scene why deleted
As a student I liked it very much
Vidya balan is just too good
Ohh Arnab Goswami had a guest role😄
But she didnt replied the student&#39;s question ,   that can we write 1+1=4?😂😂😂🤣🤣
Sakuntala Devi is extraordinary. I am excited.
Why was this scene deleted??
This shouldn&#39;t be deleted
A maths teacher like this is just imaginary for me
Amazon prime video India:- Deleted scene of Shakuntla Devi <br>Me:- If you people upload this on YT then what is the use of deleteting that scene 😑😑😑

If it was a hot scene.. they would not have deleted! <br>Why do they cut such amazing scenes?
Shakuntala Devi was a human computer, She can solve any big or small question without pan and paper.
Wow
we expect these type of scenes in movie instead of scenes with her daughter and personal matter. her skills are inspiring...
Kirron Kher would have nailed the role instead of Vidya
Wow what a scene
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Remember sushanth
Amazing
This horrible to delete such a beautiful scene... Great vidya ji... Ur acting... No sorry u r living as sakunthala mam

Sakauntala Devi : THE HUMAN COMPUTER FROM INDIA 🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️  <br><a href="https://youtu.be/IYKrrPhBfy">https://youtu.be/IYKrrPhBfy</a>
Chutya hai Bollywood k log instead of showing her intelligence they focused on something less important, being intelligent in india is joke,bwood is shitzy, seriously she was so brilliant and smart and out of the world instead of focusing on her talent this bwood pathetic people ruined her image, people around the world they show the positive side of their inteligent people like Einstein, maxwell, bohrs, Curie, bwood ek number ka madarchod hai nobody might have even heard about her before because women can&#39;t survive male dominant society of India, pathetic!!!!!!!!

aisa teacher mil jye to life bn jye...pr teacher to mc hte hai aksar aajkal.
This is a lovely thing<br>I wonder why this got deleted<br>It&#39;s really appealing, the way she convinces &quot;That is Maths&quot; it should have been there .... Really there is Magic and Fun in Math
Oh....wait.....yes.....bodmas sounds like badmash in bengali<br>And one more thing hey u lowest common factor<br>I cant
She didn&#39;t answer the questions that was asked by that child ....lol 🤣🤣😂😂😂😂

Over acting
Now Bollywood has adopted new strategy.... They r hiding nepotism in blanket of patriotism...
Please upload more deleted scenes
🤣🤣🤣Nice
This is a new trend of making biographies 😍 Which is welcomed ❤️🥰
her acting was wonderful
If all the teachers were like the teacher in the film,  then school going will be more fun. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>After all,  exams should be ended for making schools the happiest place in the world.

😊❤️ How Cute
Lot&#39;s of efforts in acting
Lowest common denominator 👀 divisor be like &quot; Mai Kya karu job chhod du fir&quot;
Wow
BINOD
Caricaturish representation of Lt. Shakuntala Devi. Now bollywood has also forgotten how to represent a particular person in his/her best possible manner.
What a energy shown by Vidya valan in the character...... It&#39;s like real
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#justiceforssr</a>
Wow this scene reminds me about my science teacher kamalam nair mam of kv meenambakkam chennai. Her way of teaching was always very fun and none of the students failed. She passed away last year. Rest in peace mam. Will always love u for ever.
That maths teacher was resembling arnav goswami right?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFZ1d0BD4x4&amp;t=114">1:54</a> The curious child askes question but the male class teacher doesn&#39;t answer his questions and than scolds him.Due to this type of teachers the students start hating them and their subject. This thing is reality in most of the school in india.We need to change this.
But, why was this scene deleted from the movie
Vidya sexy
Ab Bhai Dekho shakunatal Devi ko maths aati thi jab se vo paisa hui thi tab se ye god gifted hai ab Bhai hum logo ko to itni maths aati Nahi hai jitni aati hai utna paper me karte hai aur vaise bhi humare zamane me ab shakunatal Devi to hai nahi Jo hame maths sikha dengi..the students whom she taught maths were Very lucky I am jealous of them
Why is everyone saying Binod in the comments.... I don&#39;t understand..
I thaught he would write BINOD at beginning on board
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdgRSR6DW3E">https://youtu.be/TdgRSR6DW3E</a><br>Patriotic song 😍🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳👆 👆
but the question still remains that can 1+1=4??? if  their are no rules in math
When i saw bo i thought its binod 😂
What is jeetu bhaiya doing in the background in thumbnail..😆😆😆

Dislike because she supported Bollywood gang.

😒😒🤮🤮🤮
What a school it would be where shakuntala devi used to teach!
Our Indian Government Should Consider Sakuntala Devi&#39;s Work And Recognize Her With Prestigious Award  This Gesture Help India And It&#39;s Future We As A Country  Have To Recognize Gems Of Our Land And Spread Them And There Work With Our Future Generation It&#39;s Possible Only Adding Them In Our Text Books<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGBTHb0FigI">https://youtu.be/MGBTHb0FigI</a><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPCR6lza3Lg">https://youtu.be/PPCR6lza3Lg</a><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8FhngvxiBE">https://youtu.be/B8FhngvxiBE</a><br><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHlHcoN8XKg">https://youtu.be/BHlHcoN8XKg</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV7MwYO-_bg">https://youtu.be/EV7MwYO-_bg</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYnZT1KN0fA">https://youtu.be/yYnZT1KN0fA</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RedQux47DWs">https://youtu.be/RedQux47DWs</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtrD-yZ4HNE">https://youtu.be/NtrD-yZ4HNE</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vTnnbQ5Neg">https://youtu.be/8vTnnbQ5Neg</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCR2d4-aVWI">https://youtu.be/LCR2d4-aVWI</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYPB6KcBgY8">https://youtu.be/lYPB6KcBgY8</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RedQux47DWs">https://youtu.be/RedQux47DWs</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU_FDnLFU9A">https://youtu.be/wU_FDnLFU9A</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0fXPzcbmPk">https://youtu.be/l0fXPzcbmPk</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FnDGyKyXlg">https://youtu.be/9FnDGyKyXlg</a>

I have seen this scene I sing because I have downloaded the movie
Binod
I am a teacher  I always wish she was  my maths teacher when I was n high school bcz thre was sir he just ruined
Overacting krti hai.
Bollywood Ab sirf biopic aur remake ke bharose hai
Instead of teaching students &quot;Not to abuse&quot;. We are teaching them &#39;How to abuse in mathematics&#39;.<br><br>It&#39;s time to rethink about &quot;Where we are leading our next generation&quot;.
agr aise mam childhood main milti to aj kismat kuch aur hota
This is how children should be taught by encouraging them
these are ditto my lines...which are going in my mind...I love maths❤<br>I am <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mathsdivani">#MATHSDIVANI</a>
why? why this much overacting?this movie can be made with great compassion.
This scene should be in movie
Why it&#39;s deleted???? it&#39;s should be in the movie
Good movie❤❤❤❤

It seems promo video more than a deleted scene...
I want this movie in english
I was waiting for the answer to the question<br>No rules then <br>Why 1 +1 =4<br>But y?

They should add this in movie for those teacher who teaches maths badly to kids
😁😁😁
Overacting...
her expression was the best at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFZ1d0BD4x4&amp;t=48">0:48</a>
Who thought he is going to write Binod😋
This scene was deleted because sharing lunch is not allowed due to corona

Legendary Shakuntala<br>Legendary Vidya
LOLLOLOLOL
Did anyone notice Vidya&#39;s funny face in 0.49 !?🤣
👌👌👌👌👌
Why does the teacher looks arnub goswami tho😂😂
The teacher looks like Arnab Goswami 😄
It&#39;s a very nice scene , wonder why the makers couldn&#39;t include it .
Overacting is se jyada koi nhi kar sakta
She said maths m koi rule nhi hota h.. so why she couldn&#39;t reply 1+1=4 is not possible
Achha hua ye scene delete kar diya.
B FOR BINOD 🙈
This scene should have been included.
Kash. Humahi mathematics teacher aise tohi......

Awesome movie
What schools be if maths teacher was like Vidya Balan
Ye kyu delete ker diya, yehi damdar lag raha h<br> nahi to puri movie me motivation ke liye kuch nahi tha
Sorry guys mazak mein kiya tha yr.. But it was not funny
Faltu movie hai
I Don&#39;t Know Why This Scene is cut 😑
Wait🤔....<br><br><br><br><br>Unhone tho jawaab hi nHI Diya<br><br>Kya 1+1=4 ho Sakta hai??🤣
Lovely❤️❤️❤️
She was the MatheMagician not Mathematician!!!...Although we&#39;ve lost a precious gem but there exists one more diamond in Kerala who is just similar to Shakuntala Devi... I forgot his name but you can find him out in one of the episodes of &quot;OMG::Yeh Mera India&quot;!!!...
I      l   i   k   e         i   t   !   !   !   !
What is this BINOD thing going on? Can someone please explain?
each time i am watching the trailer or any part of the movie i am falling for VIDYA mams acting.
How many of you observed that the clock is not working? Stopped at 9.02
Why this awesome scene got deleted???? Thanks for uploading here...
Shakuntala Devi Movie Vs Original : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU7ANiPVP-o">https://youtu.be/iU7ANiPVP-o</a> watch this video of shakuntala devi in different roles, both original and movie
I think prime video also has their mathematician to calculate and put a video and series at specific time so they got maximum viewers 😄😄
Her acting is inspirational 👉🙏👍👌🙏
Salute for mam👍♥️<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKsaicSqf4y5L-4hSC2GdYg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKsaicSqf4y5L-4hSC2GdYg</a>
Lowest common denominator??seriously??
I think they deleted this scene to delete that song.
Her acting skills are awesome
Amazon prime proved 1 as prime number <br>Luv u &lt;3
Thank God this shit was cut
Initially i thought he is writing binod..😂😂😂
This is a disgusting film. Did not do any justice to Shakuntala Devi&#39;s life. So sad. So much a disgrace. Only Vidya Balan was good.
I saw B in thumbnail so I thought he&#39;s going to write Binod 😂
this scene shouldn&#39;t have been cut from the movie...... movie mea hota ye scene tho bahut acha lagta
Itna accha scene del kardiya
Exelent mind
Maths God shakuntali devi
