Malang is the movie on Netflix
Superb movie ❤
This still gives be goosebumps, what a fire trailer!!
Oh god
The Malang title track played in the trailer has a lot better tempo that the song released 😕
Kunal khemu Powerfully actor 👍👍👍
Anil kapoor gaadi ke gate se kisko marta hai ye pataa nahi chala koi janta hai kya
Who loves adi pl like😍😍
Aditya Roy Kapur&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Varun, Arjun, Ranveer, Ranbir <br>What a hotttie
After watching the movie, I can say that Elli Avram has really improved her acting<br>She was surprisingly good in this movie

Disha 💞 Aditya 💫✨❤️✨💫
Say whatever about the movie but the trailer is addictively awesome.
Disha😍

Well emulated Hollywood copy by Bollywoos as always. Still a light years behind Tollywood. Bottom line is, it&#39;s garbage. Shoulda let Telugu guys direct it. Music sucks too. Who wants useless Bollywood music during Crime Scenes? Garbage!<br>Watch Telugu Movies and it would help if you didn&#39;t copy.
A movie of the Year worth watching in Cinema Hall ....
Aditya Roy kapur is the best actor 😍😍
Dishaaaaaa😍
At last i feel sad for jesse(elli avram)
The best ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👌
My own comparison:<br>Varun Dhaun (Badlapur) is better than Aditya Roy (Malang)<br>Retish Deshmuk (Ek Villan) is better than Kunal Kemu (Malang)<br>Overall the movie is Very Good, and well done Anil Kapoor &amp; Disha Patani
Exept being romantic still action killer
Awesome👌👌👌👌👌🖤🖤🖤
Where can I find the full movie??
മലം മലം മലം 🎼🎵📣🎵🎵
Sooper movie trailer
My alll time fvrt movie...
Trailer mein khud spoiler hain <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSzmNFTlyrc&amp;t=149">2:29</a> 😀
Aaj ki raat. Kuch hone ko h re baba
Fantastic song 🤘🌠🌈💫
The trailer is for 18+ only<br>But the film (except some scenes) is superb
Amazing movie❤️❤️
Yaaar bollywood walon please please trailers main poori film dikhani band kardo!!!👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Last movie that I watched in theater.
Please do not promote the dialogue which does not belong to the movie.
I like this story ki agar koi pareshan karo to bilkul bhi mat chodna apne dil ki suno ab me bhi hui malang
Watched the movie for Anil Kapoor became fan of kunaal 🙂🙂
Who is the killer???
Aditya so handsome
Nc lov u
🖤
Superb movie
Can you tell me more movie for watching  🤗
Bring mentalist on Netflix plz
Malang movie dish patani and aditya Kapoor best charactor.....
Very wonderfull movie
Hey full bastard Bollywood
Very nice movie
Disha acting was horrifying...
Ellie Abraham&#39;s name is here but where is kunal khemu&#39;s name?
They should know how to make a trailer from TENET,no revelation !
This movie is amazing. Waiting for malang 2✨
When trailer much better THEN a full movie <br><br>That&#39;s called &quot;MALANG&quot;
I jst subscribe on netflix but malang movie is not available in it, wht happen?? Can someone tell?? Feel like wasting my money, many bollywood films tht i can’t watch on netflix
Disha patani ko chhod ke sab badhiya hai movie me...
Hello 🙂 Who khow movie like these
shraddha is not perfect for Adi.....Disha is parfect for Adi
I love the song ,it is my favorite song ,it is the best song of the world🎼
Excellent movie
dearest bollywood why are all the lead females wite-skinned?
Kunal khemur sir 😍 acting so well👍
Good movie
Movie ka trailer is so worst. How many spoilers they give. This guy is right about such movie trailers which spoils the movie. Spoiler alert for malang <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0oryigbS_M">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=b0oryigbS_M</a>
Came here after looking at the thumbnail..... cuz Disha Patani is DAMN HOT!!!🔥🔥🔥
The movie was above expectations for me.
Most of the people are attracted by thumbnail 😍
Kunal khemu  ka acting skill zabardast tha movie mein 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Whydid you upload this tseries will copystrikeyou😂
https://youtu.be/xj5wH7P8X9M
I&#39;m sure everyone thought Anil Kapoor was the villain but then the plot twist happened in the film🤪
or ek Rajkumar Santoshi
Bollywood mai Mohit suri, Anurag kashyap, Rajkumar Hirani, Abbas Mastan ye sab director ki agar movie nahi dekha to bekar hai movie dekhna...
Who says it&#39;s malang and not Ek villian 2😆
If I was 15 I would have considered watching it.
The movie which was actually as good as its trailer
I am all ready watch these movie theatre now again  in Netflix
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXs-mPEG9EE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXs-mPEG9EE</a><br>Malang Medley Mix. You will enjoy every beat
Awesome movie
Just wanna See more movies like this &amp; Kunal kemu Waah Hee is Wow in every seen i want more from him
So glad to see the heroine&#39;s name before the hero&#39;s,THANKYOU NETFLIX!
Kurnal khemu&#39;s dialogue in adiya kapur&#39; voice in trailer ? Hum tino ek jese hai
Sale haramio.....yamraz hai kya....jn Lna
Malang is the most underrated movie of recent times.. Kunal khemu completely steals the show.. 👌👌👌
Netflix always add flop movies 😂
What a brilliant movie🔥🔥🔥 pr phir bhi kuch chutiyo ko ye film psnd nhi aayi isilie ye utna success nhi mila jitna ye movie deserve krti thi
One of the best bollywood movie

It’s an amazing movie, must watch.
Never seen a trailer which showed the whole movie , when I saw the film I felt like arre yaar film ka mazaa yeh saala trailer na kharaab kar diya
Well... Totally Thrilling Movies..  Best Part is Emotion  Support By Best Music And Song
Where is subtitle when you need one
Mrs serial killer kye kam tha jo ye dal diya???😑😑
Don&#39;t waste ur time else u ll get to know y it failed in box-office..disha beauty with out any talent.worst movie of Mohit suri
Did someone noticed in the movie the last call that anil kapoor picked the girl sounded like shraddha kapoor.😎
Areyy ghantey ka confession!
So abusing drugs n all r fine now....i think these movies r one of d major reasons for mny   teenagers to lost their lives on drugs......
1.3 billion logo be yaise he jeena chata hai par paisa hai problem hai
Onnu niruthikkudeyy?
Who’s here after actually watching the movie?
Yesterday I watched this film downloaded from Torr**t . Ek number faltu movie hai . Kuch bhi nahi hai isme . 😡 . Don’t waste your time
Ga*nd lena mera mohabbat hai😂😂
Disappointed by mohit Suri..Still Ek Villian is the best suspense thriller..
Kunal khemu is the underated actor🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫 spoiler alert
Kunal kemu is the man😍
Movie was above than my expectation!!🙏 Mohit suri never ceases to amaze me.
Jhakkas bhai ki acting bade mast thee 😀😀😃😃
Garbage movie ,. .<br>Waste of time 😐
Kise ne movie nhi dakhi h like
Aaj ka andhera bahot gehra hone waala hai aur khamoshi kaan phaad 👏🏻
Tere liye bs
Mila gya freedom meri jan
Now new kachra is add on netflix india.
Superb movie
Yesterday I watched Malang. Wow what a movie Side actors Anil kapoor and Kunal khemu is good. <br>But the Hero heroin just show their body.<br>Nothing in this movie. <br>Bina haath ped ka film banaya.<br>Worst movie
Kunal khemu is the main villain this movie.
Movies downlaod kaise karte hain<br>👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇<br>https://youtu.be/xXvSq4lTaWI
Awesome Movie you should all watch this.
A film which is destroyed by 1scene in the trailer itself
are Netflix hum abhi &quot;patal  lok &quot; dekhne mein busy hai....kuch original  series  aye phir daal...kaye ko kich-  kich aisch fattu banta hai...
Add Kgf in Netflix
Best movie 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
actually typical Indian audience just don&#39;t have a taste for a movie they only consider Salmans that faltu movies  ,masala movies .......yup this movie is not a great great thriller ....but it is enough good for bollywood considering the other movies....and has a unique great taste ..........overall a good movie but didnt well in box office ....and this why the directors and producers get demotivated
At the end of the trailer they fooking ruined the spoiler
If you wanna watch .  Watch it for kunal khemu . They showed entire movie in the trailer but hided the real star of the movie ...kunal khemu.
In my opinion the trailer looks better than the movie...
Watched the movie in Netflix n came here 😍
Can this film live upto expectations i haven&#39;t seen this movie yet but i saw EK VILLIAN it&#39;s my FAVOURITE so far.....
Bogus movie wuth good trailer
