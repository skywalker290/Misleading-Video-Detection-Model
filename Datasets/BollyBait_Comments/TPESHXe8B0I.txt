Nothing is wrong abt it??  I am sure he was being humourous
Damned if you do and damned if you don&#39;t.
Yr daughter is a play girls who got husband but felling in love with a Gay like Karan Johar,first see whats happening in yr hse,then talk about others
he has a good sense of humour. He is a good personality. He didn&#39;t say anything like that to troll him
AMITABH BACHAN IS VERY CHEEKY<br>HE THINKS THAT HE IS GREAT<br>N ALSO HIS FAMILY<br>KHUD  KEH  GAR PEH  NOOKS<br>NAHI DIKHATA  BUT  DOOSARI GARPEH NOOKS DIKHATA.<br>SHAMELESS  CREATURES<br>AMITABH BACHAN N HIS FAMILY.<br>JAYA BACHAN HAS ALSO BIG MOUTH.
He just wrote that out of love i dnt think it was so serious to take
Yes
Useless  family
You collie are so consumed with the lives of the bollweirds
Isme kya galat bt boli unhone... ek fun way me Bola tha unhone
Why people first see the negative side of anything.... See the positive side too!!... He said in a jovial manner
As an elder he should be congratulating them and blessing  them instead of these silly sooo  called joke.
Whats wrong in this tweet. If their girls become cricketers of Indian team its eventually a pride for us. Nothing&#39;s wrong in saying like this.  Am not a supporter of amitabh but my objection is &quot; he just said for fun . Why can&#39;t we people take it as fun.
Why didnot bachchen become a poet then?
Amitabh your days are numbered
Big B has a big mouth I don&#39;t even Jaya I dont know  why  are they jealous of everyone
Are yaar ye masaak se bola gaya hai dont make such a news
Oh come on.... Ppl........ He just told...... Don&#39;t make it a bigggggg news as of. .... Focus on others problems in r country n not on useless things like these....
This greedy old man should go and hide himself.
I think all this hulabalu is unnecessary if big b made a comment on twitter abt the cricketers daughters i am sure it was not meant to demean anyone.  Come on guys dont make a mountain out of a molehill its uncalled for.
Whatever Big B says is misunderstood... People have lost good sense...of late...he said with good intentions... And that&#39;s all...why make fuss over this 😢🤔😇🌹 just enjoy Life..
Faltu video
😂
Please Respect our legend Amitabhji his wishing cannot be nepotism, please don&#39;t turn his tweets into hatred 🙏
He was talking in a jovial manner because most cricketers got daughters instead of sons.
It&#39;s got nothing to do for anyone to predict or make remarks of whose daughter is going to be in their foot steps. Just watch out for your own family let children be free to live their life.
Take good rest 😴💤😪
No it is not right to troll Big B the Guy is just being humorous come on people get a life you are like predators waiting to attack
No this is wrong of smoky evening big b only write his thought as he want he don&#39;t get trolled
Dour, humourless denizens.
People they’re just jealous they need to he is right if your dad is a doctor you’re going to be a doctor

B B should not say anything about other actress child because his house is worst than anyone else. His whole life is based on cheating, bullying, arrogant.
He is become depressed ,mad
What about him his daughter is not actress she is druggist
He said a joke 😂 I just took it as a joke😂
Bless him . He is the living god in india. And can say do wat he wants. 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Am sure whatever he said was with good intentions...infact it would be wonderful to have women playing in the national team.Thank you big B.
Abhishek is an amazing actor he can act well at less better than Salman

Something has gone wrong with mr Bachman. He is idle so talks nonsense. Let him keep his comments for his grand children. Boycott

Who want Shahid Kapoor and Mira rajput love story by Smoky evening hit like to this comment let&#39;s see how much viewers are waiting for this video
hehe i am here
Big b is so  arrogant  as he is  no one  to  tell  them   that  what  should  their  children  to  do
Let him decide if his grand daughter is going to become an actress  first, then he can decide for other celeb children.
Please tell Big B who to me is now Small B to first clean up the dirt within his family before making comments on others, what an a..hole
What is making fun? This is not making fun he just said like that
Why you guys are interfering ziva and mahi in this video
Ohh god log chooti chooti baaton ka bhatangar bana dete hai <br><br>Sahi matlab nikalana kyu nahi aata.<br>And what if he did spelling mistakes <br>Did the guys who are trolling never did mistake in writing.<br><br>I just want to say kee baatao ko positive way mein bhi lena chahiye
The people of India just want to create controversies on stupid topics it was just comedy and small joke .... we know that a big B has a good sense of humour he probably just gave this statement as a joke .... BUT we all know people of India just want to create  controversies on stupid topics
Imagine smoking evening get heart to me 🥰🥰❤
Hii smoky evening
So what is wrong in this case?? It will be the parents and kids&#39; choices after all if the dauthers will be intrested in cricket than they will go,if not that they won&#39;t,no one can change thier desison.
