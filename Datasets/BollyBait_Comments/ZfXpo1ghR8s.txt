What are the odds that a guy like  u would  WANNA HANG OUT  WITH  ME ?
That day was special
For abay deol 🥰🥰🥰😍😍👍👍✌✌🤞🤞🤞🤞
Neflix the most pretentious ott in India right now.
The lead actress is so annoying
Movie is good.. Watch it.. But i wish song played in the movie should havr been uploaded in the youtube..it would have been much much better
Where can I find this movie??
Abhay was sooo charming in this movie ❤️✨
this movie is so good . 💞
this movie is so underrated 😭💞
Monica❤️
It&#39;s a great movie. Don&#39;t look any further, just watch it! 🙌
It looks like a copy of the end of the fucking world.
Did any one understood the story of the movie? Please koi samjha do yaar
Netflix 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘
Netflix ke jai ho mujy be koi movie m ly lo g

OOOOOO OOOOOO OOOOOO music in trailer and Bollywood thinks it becomes Hollywood. LOL......
I didnt get this movie? Can someone explain what was it about?
Great movie...great work 😝✌calm thing
Watched it loved it ❤️
I really love to watch Abhay Deol.He is one of the most inspiring actor in bollywood
Abhay deol is a heritage filmy man,, his father&#39;s movie maa and he loves his mom, I want to say one thing to Abhay deol, we do cap lamp issue in munidih colliery on Abhay construction name, Are you Abhay construction?
Y&#39;know I always thought Abhay Deol was super cute. Like I even found him cuter than Hrithik Roshan in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara even though Hrithik Roshan is thought to be the handsomest man in India. Abhay Deol, if you ever read this, I love you and I think you are absolutely amazing! &lt;3
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfXpo1ghR8s&amp;t=57">0:57</a> Isn&#39;t that old lady from whatsapp ad??
Abhay deol😊😊Gonna watch it Simple.Such a natural and talented actor.Watched his every movie. Manorma 6 feet under, to dev D to Ahista Ahista to Socha na tha and all.Superb.Seems he fits <a href="http://everywhere.so/">everywhere.So</a> classy in script selection.Maybe underrated but certainly not a derby horse
Will watch it for Monica Dogra, my love.
i am here after watching movie.  i liked this movie
Hey You!!! <br>You<br><br>Yes you<br><br><br><br><br><br>You are Perfect❤
Really loved this movie. Almost feels like a slice of life anime.

Such a cute movie ❤️😍
Abhay deol😍😍😍😍
This time only for telent not reference Actors,  Aby deol related with Bollywood Family but hi is best talented actor ever .so from this time I am Going to watch his movies always,  only talented actor my list not fucking Movie mafiya and bijann..RIP susan Sir but you are winner
This is a really good movie! I read somewhere that someone compared its style to that of Wes Anderson and honestly, I cannot find a better description than that. It is the best adaptation of Wes Anderson&#39;s eccentric motifs in a relatively original, Indian format.

i’m in love. with this movie, with the soundtrack, with the aesthetic. and i’d be lying if i said that this isn’t one of the best movies i’ve watched in a long, long time. ♥️

Zero stars,don&#39;t waste your time on this.
Really wished this was a show
Kya babaseer banaya hai ye..
No subtitles... Netflix, small things matter! I heavily sell Indian content to my non-Indian friends. Though this trailer is mostly in English, it does make them lose interest as the Hindi is not translated.
Defuq I just saw
The movie doesn&#39;t make any sense....its just all random stuff and thats y i liked it😃
Abhay Deol my fav actor ❤️<br>His acting is pure and original ❤️❤️
What are the odds that we&#39;ll like this?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfXpo1ghR8s&amp;t=18">0:18</a> gilly suit🤣🤣 like if you are a pubg lover👇👇👇
Abhay Deol is one of the best natural actor of Bollywood industry and this subject is gonna rock because of Abhay Deol if someone have doubt then watch his ( DEV D)movie or any you want you will see a great natural talent.
Not a abhay deol movie , abay is only for like a anchor type role , I don&#39;t like movie 10/2.
Must watch .. i just finished it off. The  best ever web series so far .. it will blow ur mind and make u feel in diffrent world .. highly recommended.. well done abhay sir ..
what is the name of the song ???
Dwarves are getting noticed as artists after &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. <br>How many of you agree...?

I just finished watching the film abhay is just awful I mean come on you can&#39;t go from oye lucky lucky oye to this man come on the story was awful dude plz bring back the old magical abhay we loved and admired very very dissapointed
I see Abhay Deol, I click Like.
Yeh ladki mast acting karti hai... Hum pehchante hai isko...
Why the cinematography is giving me little bit of Wes Anderson vibes. Do not take this for criticism, this is love.
Finally something Fresh!!
good to see abhay deol back on screen 🙏
DIrector, Music Composer, Lyricist, Background Score, Edit, Cinematography by NETFLIX INDIA <br>No need of technician
There are some trailers like Housefull 3 and I know that I am not going to watch it ever...<br>There are some trailers like Patal Lok and I know that it has to be definitely watched<br>and then there are some trailer like this and you can&#39;t predict that how it will be
😃
@Netflix India justice for AK Hangal
Your comment gets pinned only when &#39;Odds are in your favour&#39; 😉
<b>Nefflix, make a Play Date version for Abhy Deol!</b>
<b>*my first favourite artist 🎨🎭 </b><b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23abhaydeol">#Abhaydeol</a></b><b>.*</b>
Netflix is buying everything just to get benefited
Why does this kinda give me end of the fucking world vibes?
I think its an indian version of End of the fuck**g world
Abhay deol my favourite actor
Kainy
The End of the F***ing World जैसा ही है ये मूवी
मूवी हिंदी में होता तो अच्छा होता. एक और बात मुंबई के अलावा भी किसी और सिटी के स्टोरी पे मूवी बना लिया करो
Another poorly reviewed series...Netflix India can’t give good shows
Abhay Deol we want to see ur more work.
Feel good wali koi web series bta do yr.... suspense thriller bahut dekh liya...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfXpo1ghR8s&amp;t=67">1:07</a> what&#39;s that kid doing 😆😆
Anyone getting the vibe of Wes Anderson? Or it is just me. :)
Seems very interesting

I wasted my time by watching this very week script,plot and acting too. Netflix India is a garbage box and it contains very poor movies like this
Seen the movie Very very very disappointed 👎👎👎
One more disaster
Liked for abhay deol
I like abhey deol voice
Odd or stranger&#39;s
Copy of End of the Fucking World
Yashaswini fan from phobia🍀
It is a disaster. I wasted my 1.32 hours on it.
Liked before watching.<br><br>Love DEOL...
Yashaswini Dayama is Favourite 💕💕
One day coming generation will say that this generation has underestimated Abhay Deol&#39;s acting
Others:Great content<br>Pub g players: why is he wearing a gilli suit(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfXpo1ghR8s&amp;t=17">0:17</a>)
Hollywood ki feel aa rahi hai... <br>Nice..bollywood bhi abhi apne so called typical love triangle wale concept se bahr aa raha hai..
Abhay deol ko Dekh k hamesha chehre pe smile AA jaati h☺️
<a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/TQJHyM/">https://vm.tiktok.com/TQJHyM/</a>
Please don&#39;t release it ... Better to scrap it.
Ye netto release.havent slept 19/20 may
Kya bawaaeer bana diya
Tik rating decrease by 2.6 ... <br><i>__From 4.6 stars to 2 stars only_</i> 💪😎
I&#39;m loving the whole &#39;Wes Anderson&#39;  style of directing!
Hope to see Dharmendra, Sunny, Bobby and Abhay deol together in a movie...
I think this is shot in Pune. And Pune looks beautiful.
Same Content Netflix Ka please bring something New !
Abhay sir we want to see you more and more 😍😍😘😘
And when u really wants to see acting , turn to web series rather than Bollywood drama ..
Yashawani in Dice Media&#39;s &quot;Adulting&quot; and her! Completely opposite
As always... Bollywood actors can only do shitty love story drama... This is their aukaat!
Ray i love your acting...
wooow I like it
bohot hi fuzool. The only attraction is Abhay Deol
Bhai iss ko kon kon like karta h movie like karo

Why am I getting too much &quot;The end of the f*cking world&quot; Vibes??
It&#39;s good that Netflix India casts Abhay Deol but still, the role he gets doesn&#39;t take out his full caliber. Chopsticks was an okay movie but it&#39;s not enough.

Abhay Deol is back. <br>And with Yashaswini too<br>Time to renew my subscription. 😎
Abhay deol  👍👍
Yashashwini ..💜 <br>One of the finest talent out there !!<br>I&#39;m glad she&#39;s getting more roles
The best Deol 🖤
I don&#39;t like Yashaswini at all.. what are the odds?
If abhay deol is there then i am watching it because you do learn something from his film <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23znmdfan">#ZNMDFAN</a>
Abhay Ji hai to dekna banta hai no doubt best hi hoga

At the moment I see Abhay Deol on the thumbnail, smile comes to my face. He is so cute.
@Netflix India , This looks like an Indian rip-off of The End of the Fu**in world. I guess it is the end now when independent platform start making same content from different versions. Haha. The one and only thing sellable anout this whole trailer is one and only Abhay Deol. (The only Deol who knows acting well)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfXpo1ghR8s&amp;t=67">1:07</a> will make you smile

Netflix on a mission to westernise India.
Ise Tik tok pe release kar do. Shayad ek aadh janwar dekh le.

Abhay Deol<br>Jimmy Shergill<br>Randeep Hooda<br>Are the most underrated actors

Yashaswini🥰🥰😘😘

😊😊
Good to see Abhay ji deol ..very underrated actor of Bollywood
Finally he come back
Writers ke bhi credits add kara karo Netflix wale/i Bhaiya/didi
Could this be inspired by &quot;The End of the F***ing World&quot; by any chance? Loner boy meets outsider girl. Idiosyncratic and disfunctional yet very new age Indian. Feels kinda fresh overall.
Film me chhupe kuch sawalo ke zawab<br><a href="https://www.apnikhabar.online/2020/05/abhay-deol-starrer-what-are-odds-all.html">https://www.apnikhabar.online/2020/05/abhay-deol-starrer-what-are-odds-all.html</a>

No lockdown for Netflix
Kalka time pass mil gya bhai , chalo parso ki planning dekhte hain ab
Anyone noticed the gillie suit 😅😅
The amt. of kachra netflix produces oh gosh!
kaafi Hollywood wali feel A rhi h.<br>seems pretty Nice And Sweet series.
They are trying to make pg version of end of the fucking world <br>Even they copied that i conic wood scene <br>But i hope it&#39;s going to be great <br>Abhay deol role should be big
Yashaswini is really great...😍😍
Abhay deol kamaal ka actor h <br>Waiting for this bhai <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23babaharyanvi">#BabaHaryanvi</a>

Abhay Deol is always a delight to watch. 🥃
Abhay deol ke liye dekhna padega

Yashaswini is so effortlessly good. Loved her in Dear Zindagi!
After ghost stories, guilty and mrs. serial killer,  here comes another disaster from Netflix.
Petition : Every trailer need to clarify if its a series or a movie.
Wes Anderson feels anyone ?
Y NetFlix India is buying everything served on the plate.. Is there no Selection Team or by watevr name they R called at Netflix India Office....?
Kuch nahi samjha
Well well yeh song ki tune guardians of  galaxy 2 song ki copy hai
I&#39;m hoping there is no overacting by teen-agers..
<b>That&#39;s not Indian content...don&#39;t sell your trash here Netflix..</b>
it&#39;s look like and of the fucking world web series which is available on Netflix itself
isn&#39;t abhay resembles with dharmender .....????
Fev. Abhay deal🤴
Star kids ho toh akshay khanna abhay deol abhimanyu dasani etc jaise ho
It will be biggest flop of netflix
Apney paas to Netflix haiye nahin !
I&#39;ll only watch this for yashaswini .......♥️♥️♥️<br>She is so genuine actor.....!
After he acted in zindagi na milegi dobara i fell in live with his acting . Waiting for this eagerly!!!! ♥️😘
Only for Abhay deol
This is arriving sooner than expected!
Trailer looks really nice.
Abhay Deol is good actor
I want money heist Tamil version for all seasons plzzz accept my request 🙏🙏🙏
Abhay Deol 👏👏
And here he comes. ABD
Has anyone noticed that the guy starring opposite Yashaswini is Jagiya from the fame Balika Vadhu...
This has some serious Royal Tenembaum Vibes...
The only reason I liked this video is abhay deol or else I am sorry but the story isn’t interesting to me 🤷🏼‍♀️
Abhay should be working in Hollywood.. Bollywood is nothing but nepotism and stupid same scripts with minor changes at the end it comes down to unrelistic love ..... If I win a lottery and make millions I will definitely make movie with Abhay not in bollywood but Hollywood where people follow and respect  content...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCMt9s_zJo0">https://youtu.be/JCMt9s_zJo0</a>
bakwaas lagaa pr pata ni kyu... magar lga bd gullie suit accha tha.....
I see Abhay Deol in the thumbnail, I click it
Not really interesting by the looks of it, saw this kind of movies/series more than enough. I hope this wouldn&#39;t be a copy and paste.
Directed by Megha Ramaswamy. It has to be a really good stuff.
Abhay Deol is the most underrated actor of Bollywood<br>No. Of People Who agree<br>👇<br>👇(I&#39;m a middle class singer. Support me 🙏)
Abhay is the only reason I would wanna watch this.<br>karanvir seems good too
ओम साई राम🙏<br>अभय देओल और टीम को बहोत बहोत शुभकामनाएं, बड़े अंतराल के बाद अभय देओल को देख सकेंगे
What were the odds that we would see abhay deol again? 😍😍😍
NGL, I love the vibes of all the locations shown in this trailer 💝
Nice
Looks interesting
Abhay deol deserves much moreeee
Bhaiii please.... don&#39;t release
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfXpo1ghR8s&amp;t=18">0:18</a> le gillie suit 😀😅😆😆
The most amazing tallented and underrated actor.. But honestly that&#39;s totally fine he selects his scripts and works on it .. Giving always wonderful entertainments... Big fan Abhay Deol ji..

Love to watch Abhay Deol.....
Abhay deol is awesome as always
Strangers thing in with desi tadka 👌
This girl Yashaswini is rocking every bit of it..  ❤️❤️
Alyssa &amp; James ❤️
The girl if I am not mistaken has done a role in the movie Phobia
👌🏼💯
Abay deol we love u
When is going to release?
Abhay deol will nail it
Soo is this a series or movies??
Looks like the lite version of the end of the fucking world
Abhay Deol is so refreshing and effortless. Coincidentally just got done with Shanghai on Netflix.
Only Netflix knows value of abhay deol
Stopped the trailer in the mid. Why do a spoiler when you&#39;re gonna watch genius Abhay Deol at work anyway ❤<br><br>Bollywood doesn&#39;t deserve Abhay Deol. Period.
Ok so this is copied from...???
Abhishek Bachchan and Abhay Deol.<br>You know what I mean...
The only DEOL who makes sensible movies, and Yash is perfect for for this role
Like that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23haraamkhor">#haraamkhor</a> movie
He got all the acting talent among other Deol&#39;s
Netflix, what are the odds that people are gonna watch this ?
Bekar he koi kutta b nahi dekhega
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3NOBP_C0K0">https://youtu.be/H3NOBP_C0K0</a>
Why it&#39;s feel like end of fuckin world ....
God.. How much i had wished to see Abhay Deol in a new movie. This guy is a gem of a actor. His laid back style of acting and the offbeat roles he accomplishes with utmost ease has always made me wonder why Bollywood never gives the due respect he deserves.   Thank you NETFLIX.
Abhayyyyyy... Haayyyyeee...
Very artistic visuals 👌
Already on my watchlist the moment I saw Abhay Deol in the thumbnail
Hit one like for abhay deol....he always choose something which is very different from going trend...since his first movie.
this movies will either be REALLY BAD or REALLY GOOD
One of the finest actor but bollywood politics  ruined his career... But still he is one of my favorite.
एक लाइक तो अभय के लिए बनता है। बहुमुखी प्रतिभा के धनी इस कलाकार को देखकर हमेशा आनंद की अनुभूति होती है। धन्यवाद नेटफ्लिक्स हिंदुस्तान ।
Abhay Deol hai Toh Sab Mast hai
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforcarry">#justiceforcarry</a>
♥️
Feels like a remake of Adventureland (2009)
Abhay Deol I LOVE YOU
Is this a series or a movie?
Literally it&#39;s like my favorite series &quot;the end of the fucking world&quot; in indian version love it.....
Abhay Deol, one of the most unorthodox, underrated Indian actors. It&#39;s really sad that he&#39;s not getting roles he truly deserves. Hope this changes.
Ye kya kuchh bhi bana diye ho be
Looks delightful.
Abhay Deol is a good actor with extraordinary skills.
Looking like another worst from Netflix. Abhay Deol is a good actor but these stories no
Abhay is only talented actor in his Deol family..
Ye movie mere ilake me shoot hoi ni sakti 😂😂🤣...wo upperclass mehenga look nahi aega ...<br>Abhay sir 👍
Waiting for this.. Team ILS
Abhay deol is super talented ❤️❤️❤️
ye sab nakli cheezay hai...asli cheez dikao pataal lok type...samjhayyyy
<b>Chodu duniya ka khatma</b>
Bollywood is more concerned about overrated actors but now due to number of platform we have got a chance to watch underrated talents. Additionally OTT platforms link Hindi/English audiance with amazing PAN India cinema like tamil, Telugu, Marathi, malayalam etc through dubbing or providing subtitles facilities.
I don&#39;t understand why some of the indian series are in English language,and they tag as the Hindi content,if u want to make in English language then make ,why mixing, please either make fully English content or Hindi content and please don&#39;t mixed and don&#39;t forget Hollywood series have great English content
I&#39;m a simple man, i see abhay deol, i watch it.
It&#39;s the guy from selection day
Maoe more films with Abhay Sell...he&#39;s such an underrated actor...
Lucky aur bangali saath me 👌👌👌
Well abhay Deol is better with Netflix and not with dumbass Bollywood
This looks like a breath of fresh air in these days! SO EXCITED! Abhay has all my heart. 😍
I trust abhay deol.....<br>But I don&#39;t trust netflix<br>So I will wait....... until the review
Dear jindagi... Jesa ku6?
I wanna see this movie coz of kantah bai
One thing I can say there is no sun in this show...bahar jake dekho dhup see phati padi h
Vo Sab to thik hai par....<br><br>itni ENGLISH kaahe. 😩
Yashaswiniii!!! Rayyyy❤️
I have liked only for yashashwini dayama
Abhey Deol ...the most underrated actor .....feel sad as well as angry ..for him not getting his dues as well as recognition.....always saw him at par with irfan Khan ...famous for effortless expressions ..acting ..portraying emotions through eyes ..and face expressions ...good to see him after ages or you can say after chopsticks ....on Netflix ....👍🏻👍🏻 but as one says ...hard work and talent is not enough till you have luck and that all the good one on your side ..in this industry ....hope one day he finally achieve what he deserve ...😔😔😔
Watching this trailer only for abhay deol
excited 😁<br>yashaswini  ❤️❤️❤️
Wes Anderson-esque
I felt love ke the end of fucking world scenes!!
Kanta Bhen?!
Is she kanta bai?
Looks fun!
Cant wait man!!
You just know it&#39;ll be good when you see Abhay Deol
Kya Backchodi hai yaar... Koi aur content nahi Mila Kya...
A tinge of money Heist?
Love watching Abhay since Socha Na Tha.
Apreciate the trailer but this trailer reminded me of some movie I have seen anyone else felt the same?
In his initial roles in bollywood , he did some interesting roles but Netflix instead of these stories including that last one could have made Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye sequal or new storyline with that same character that he played in that above movie .
Arre kehna kya chahte ho??
What are the odds that Netflix India will make better content?
Woody Allen&#39;s influence a little around
Scott pilgrim ki vibes aaya mujhe to.. anyone else?
is it supposed to be an indian version of The end of the f**king world?
Netflix India is going down REALLY, REALLY FAST. <br><br>I am afraid Sacred Games seems like a fluke now.
Abhay Deol ko wapas laate rehne ke liye shukria Netflix waalo&#39;n 🙏🏼
I&#39;ve had enough of candy content Netflix.
Netflix why you foxing Bollywood actorJust do the dubbing of Hollywood contact in Hindi on Netflix I am from India but I don&#39;t like Indian actors
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfXpo1ghR8s&amp;t=37">0:37</a> that&#39;s sulabha arya after watching this trailer my mom recognised her... She was my mother&#39;s phycology teacher in high school NB and LU collage, she was also her theatre teacher, my mom is was really happy to her that even today she is doing what she always loved.
Abhay was very good in Chopsticks. It was quite disappointing that the critics didn&#39;t like that hilarious movie.
Does everything has to be a fucking musical in bollywood... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23growup">#growup</a> bollywood...
It looks like the Hindi version of the end of f*cking world but also not. 😂 looks interesting but I don&#39;t think peeps are gonna watch :(
🖤
Only for yashaswini🥰🥰👍
I like how Netflix chooses talented actors because bollywood has dominated by nepotism and these actors never got credit for their work.
Is anybody getting the vibes of  &quot;The End of the Fkin World&quot;
What are the odds that south indian directors have already reached hollywood cinema...
What are the odds that a guy like you would want to hang out with a girl like me?
Are bo starting m gully suit main kon tha 😂😂
We need some more out of u ABHAY SIR
The best abhay deol
Netflix walo ko abhay sahab saste me mill ja rhe aaj kl....
Idk a Netflix film always feels like a Netflix film, in a bad way.
I&#39;m here for Kanta Ben 💝
Abhay Deol is ❤️❤️ and Yashaswini is so cute 😍 I love them!!
From the day of &quot;Dear zindagi&quot;,  i know that Yashaswini Dayama will get some big projects...Yahooooooooo....🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mycrickettown">#MyCricketTown</a>
Looks like a homage to Wes Anderson. Abhay Deol seems to be a perfect match for this universe. High Hopes!
Yashswini dyanymic
Bakvaas
Yashasvini. ♥️
Abhay Deol ko trailer me dikha do aur web series hit.
When is it releasing?
It legit looks good.
Moonrise kingdom, royal tenenbaum, Rushmore and a few other Wes Andrerson movies mixed with Indian green mangoes and the sweetness of Hindi language - hopefully yum
WHAT IS THAT FKN AMAZING SONG, WILL SOMEONE TELL ME!!!
Go n watch my roasting video on ajaz khan and many more.... Need support ❤️
कोलेजीयन कबूतरो के लिए यह मूवी हे 😊
Netflix India is like Netflix bhojpuri
I think it&#39;s like &quot;End of the fucking world &quot; .. bus sale remake hi krte rhte h.. ya to south ka ya phir Hollywood ka..
So excited to watch Abhay again after quite a long time (last one was Chopsticks) ... good to see him in a zone where he can do the kind of work he wants to do , not running after the 100 crore club !!!
Indian version of THE END OF THE FUCKING WORLD
How come these people speak english so fluently....some times I just don&#39;t understand what they say 😲
End of fking world heloo
English nahi aati....
I like yashaswini alot
yeh netlflix india saste wale nashe karne laga hai
Wanted more of Abhay Deol here. But it will work
Another English Language Netlfix Flick....Showing English Language Films In India....Even Hollywood Films Are Dubbed In Hindi....Netlfix Is Just A Antiindian Video Streaming Service...Shame!
Avay is here .. Nothing to fear 💙💙💙
Abhay chosen right platform. And it’s the time for OTT. Days are gone when talented actors had to wait for opportunities because Netflix itself is the biggest opportunity :)
I&#39;m here for only abhay deol ❤
Looks promising

Why does this look like a new season of &#39;The end of the f***ing world&#39;?
Once again Abhay is back with a unique &amp; out of box content.....We viewers should respect such actor when we have time....😎
Indian version of end of the fu<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23king">#king</a> world
Just how many web series  Netflix had planned before Lockdown
He is like to v next &quot;sir Irfan khan&quot;<br>Doing best acting but rated low , <br>ONE DAY HE SHINES LIKE ,IRFAN SIR.👍👍
Abhay Deol is the only Deol I know,  who knows how to Act.. He really knows the craft of acting.. I love him &amp; his craft..
This is something really amaziiinnnggg
Anybody else getting &quot; THE end of the fu*king world&quot; vibes? <br>No just me. Ok
i sense a good movie here.... like finally
I would like to thank Netflix for making life better during this lockdown!
Red track pants, a LOT of symmetry, idiosyncratic characters, 60s sounding music. Folks, we just might have a Desi Wes Anderson flick right here.
Abhay deol❣👌
The director has wrked beautifully with the composition of each frame.certainly looks different.A must watch!Vijji
Bakwaas... Koi masala nahi hai isme..... Netflix unsubscribe karna padega..... Amazonprime better hai Amriki platforms me....<br>BTW Bhai ko webseries me kab dekhenge? Pura 10 episode tak entry scene hoga...  kahaani nahi bhi ho to chalega.....
Ray madav in the house 😍😍😍😍<br>Netflix sala tum kabh kabh dil jeet lete ho..
janiye kon tha OMAR MUKHTAR??<br>know who was OMAR MUKHTAR??<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S1g20gNKCU">https://youtu.be/5S1g20gNKCU</a>
A rapid montage of all that is relevant to the youth ...superb VR
This looks like &quot;The End of the Fucking World&quot; Indian version....
NETFLIX: Abhay Deol??<br>ME: Anytime Man, Anytime!
❤️💫this is sooooo goood
😕
In association with ABHAY DEOL, say no more fam. Im in.
Floop jayega
Wes Anderson vibes
Coming best <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fSlGG_qnzs">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3fSlGG_qnzs</a>
So cute !!!
Abhy deol next radhika aapte🤘
Again a flop show i guess
अभय देओल से इससे better की उम्मीद है
THEM - Why dont you have any friends?<br>ME - I am not the most social person.
I love the Wes Anderson type shots.
Abhya is Back 👊👊 one of my fav actor. Thanks Netflix
Hope this doesn&#39;t turn out to be another chopsticks
What are the Odds that trailer is dropping on 18th and Film Releasing 20th of the same month??
Why does it feel they tried ripping off Wes Anderson but failed
18 Ko Trailer<br>20 Ko Release<br>Badi Jaldi mein Ho Netflixwa😅
What are the odds of we making it through?
Woooaaaahhhh ....netflix our rescuer for the quarantine ...trailer looks awesome.!!
Abhay deol deserve better than this..<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23krishnabhaiyabanarawale">#krishnabhaiyabanarawale</a>
By the look and the style I thought it was directed by Homi Adajania.
Ghillie suit 😂😂
कहानी अच्छी है । पर कुछ ज्यादा Netflix को ध्यान में रख कर नही बना दी । कुछ looks कुछ dilouge । netflix की सीरीज से प्रेरित है ।
Are kissing scenes the new cool?? I mean i have seen a lot of web series and movies on ott platforms where kissing scenes or semi nude scenes were there even if the script didn&#39;t  demanded so....
In love 😍❤️😍
@NetflixIndia Plx make Abhay Deol your next Radhika Apte
Abhay Deol 🙌🏻
I never Knew ... I needed this comedy series with Abhay, Monica, Yashaswini in cast ... YES !

Kantaben!!!!!!!!!
&quot;End of the fucking world&quot; vibes
Stop selling this on the name of Abay Deol please, why the brilliance in this world is destroyed by overrated storytellers and some actors who went nuts because of success. <br>Netflix, please make a proper series with Abay Deol...He is one of the most underrated actor in the industry and worth more than what he is getting currently.
<b>I&#39;m</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Okay</b> <b>With</b> <b>This</b>
yashaswini ❤️
Make new series like lunchbox

I can&#39;t wait!!
This Deol is &quot;Abhay&quot; when it comes to choosing films...
Lagta hay Netflix indian than liya hay ki Netflix ko indian se bahar nikal na hay
Abhay Deol had a big fight with Shankar Ehsan Loy and after that his career went down . Poor Abhay ... didn&#39;t even estimate the consequences before fighting with someone like the trio&#39;s.
Abhay Deol best
ghillie suit.... @18sec
Yashswini&#39;s acting seems like female version of Sumit vyas.
trailer samjh nhi aaya par dekh kar acha lga

Finally abhay!
Most underrated actor of our generation.

Girl looks like eleven from stranger things... even the clothes r pretty much same<br><br>And @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfXpo1ghR8s&amp;t=37">0:37</a> professor and team after a successful heist😀
Bring back Carry&#39;s smile guys...
This trailer gives me end of the fucking world vibe
Will watch it only for Abhay Deol. It&#39;s so good to see him after a long time.

This video is as longer as it&#39;s descending nmbr of time😂😂😂😂😂see..
Abhay devol best movie Zindagi Na milegi dubara 🤘🤘
Only for👍Abhay Deol
Is this film or series?
<b>As we all know that ABHAY DEOL is most underrated actor.</b>
Abhay Deol returns. Amazing!
These are the evens of the odds!
Abhay deol really deserves better from bollywood. His calibre is of devd and socha na tha he&#39;s seriously been let down with the kind of scripts hes been given.
Love fie
Netflix India me apana naam kharab karke he manega shayad!!

Yar Indian centric shows banao na ye foreign shows se inspired hoke shows kyun bana rahe ho.... netflix is loosing its charm.... AmazonPrime is launching shows like Paatal Lok and netflix what are the odds ..... Odds that u dont make good shows anymore Netflix india.
