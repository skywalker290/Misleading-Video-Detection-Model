It was really nice gesture from her. 😊👍
Her father was German her mom was Bengali.. after their parents divorced her mother married a Hyderabadi who was also Muslim. So her mom adopted his surname. Thus Dia Handrich became Dia Mirza. I always wondered why she looks like Bengali with western touch 😄. Well now I know
Fate did not do justice with such a nice girl.Alas! at last she has found happiness.

Dia Mirza is half German and half Bengali Hindu by genes and half Muslim by parentage. Dia Mirza uses her step-father&#39;s surname Mirza and has recently added the surname of her father Frank Handrich and is now called Dia Mirza Handrich.
