Wahts so fun abt watching these old hags anyways...
These comments suck, i loved this show it is my favorite of the real housewives shows
Hello cringe aunties
They should have reacted to Tanmay reacting to them 🤣
Actually I have no idea about Bollywood wives..after I watched and followed this ...Only one comment.. You are very amazing..Good mother..best wife and having a best friends....I m big fan from Thailand...I specially admire Mrs. Maheep...
Bhavana is so Miranda on sex and the city... like they are the same person
One thing I’ve noticed about this reality show is that they’re really behaving like the Kardashians. These Bollywood wives are quite modern and are not different.
Proof that money can&#39;t buy you elegance or class.
This maheep kapoor is especially getting under my skin.
This is so funny!
Being themselves....No pretense,no wonder nepo-kids are so delusional.
Honestly it would be funnier if they reacted to tamnay reacts to fabulous lives of bollywood wives!
It&#39;s amazing to watch unapologetic women and their lives. Honestly it&#39;s a good show, if u don&#39;t like it don&#39;t watch.
the only thing that came to my mind after watching this is &quot;WOW ! SO LAME&quot;.
are they actually reacting to reality tv? <br>as if they didn&#39;t know what was happening, this isn&#39;t cinema at its finest lmao....
Add some depth women ! Deal with lives in depth !
Bhavna is the best . Natural and expressive without any artifice !
Useless lives of Bollywood tatties
Now I want their reaction to Tanmay&#39;s reaction of them
I just love watching this show
I lost it when Bhavana said, &quot;My tarot card reader has studied astrology.&quot; xD
They should react to Tanmay reacts, reacting on them 😂
In logo Hindi kyu nahi aata. Aisa kyu hota hai ameer logo ko Hindi kyu nahi aata.
Bad series
Why can&#39;t they speak hindi ? (indias national language)
No one:<br>Neelam: Okayy
I loved bhavana the most and neelam too
আমার গেম পৃথিবীর সবথেকে কিটিকাল গেম সবাইকে পাততা দেবো না বেছে বেছে বডি দেখে তবেই বিছানা গেম 😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕
Most idiotic show ever
And now they&#39;ll say they did this stupid show for free! LOL
its so irritating that they think they have done enough for the environment by doing a beach cleanup but at the same time buy new cars and more houses to increase emissions
Pagal
It’s like the kardashian show or housewives of beverly hills but more annoying and the show off doesn’t stop like I never seen a celebrity in NY get hyped over lv bags or brag that they own a rolls Royce my neighbor owns one they are not even actors or celebrities
im american and i love love love this show soooo much cant wait for season 2!!!
I love Maheepppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
I don’t know why I love Neelam She looked like class 😎
This is what happens when your out of content
Enjoyed watching the show - it was fun
Brainless aunties uncles
Sima doesn’t even live with her husband haha what a joke marriage
I wish real rich women don’t act like this . So arrogant and annoying.
Are they reacting to their reactions? 🤣
Why people are criticizing so much, they just have so much opinion and time, don&#39;t watch it if u don&#39;t like it, anyway I watched it and liked it too
But the negative asides but i love this movie ❤️❤️
Love Arjun and Maheep  openly admit they were not invited to Aish and Abhishek&#39;s wedding and had to use binoculars to be a part of it..height of sadness
Sanjay kapoors wifes the biggest snob
Third class people with money...<br>And to all d foreigners we all don&#39;t behave and think dz way🙏
You could be poor or middle class orhigh class but that one thing will be same everywhere  &#39;parents controlling their kids without understanding that they have their own lives and struggles&#39; . That poor  Jahaan. <br>Parenting lessons are a must for everyone.
I loved the show. It&#39;s my guilty pleasure ❤️
They should react to tanmay bhat reaction....:)
It was totally bullshit 😅😅 this show as well as the series
Disgussting show
Ridiculous. Over acting. Gold diggers.
wow im not asian i just watched out of enjoyment and i really liked it, but seems like alot of actual asians really did not enjoy this. its kinda more so the real housewives of India than the Kardashians I feel<br>i know it may seem like your country is getting shown in a &quot;bad light&quot; but i hope u know we dont watch this thinking this is all indians, we really watch for entertainment and these girls are very entertaining. i dont think it&#39;s fair to put the reputation of ALL of India on their backs
the lady with pink top (not neelam) such a drame baazzz
Hi Netflix,please do not post a second season of this otherwise Netflix may lose many viewers. Thank you.
Bollywoods very own damage control 🤣
I seriously felt empathy for Ananya Pandey and all the star kids about their so called shallowness, this is the kind of toxic environment they are growing up in, so no wonder 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ and Arjun is actually a good person!
I really enjoyed watching The Bollywood Wives. With absolutely zero knowledge of Bollywood, I just took them at face value and couldn’t help liking them. They made me laugh, which is just the tonic we all need these days.
Wowww
The best scenes in this whole series is the camel toe of seema sachdev in beach clean up
Behan ki laudio mar jao ....
Karan J ka KACHRA
After watching the S1, Bhavna Panday has better acting skills than Ananya Panday
Disgusting people&#39;s
This show was pathetic
&quot;Some people are so poor, all they have is money.&quot;<br>-Bob Marley
In this comment  section, women are being jealous  of women.
They are so disgusting n abusive. So not the role model even for their children.
This show&#39;s def better than bigg boss although they both are cringe af😂
I don&#39;t think that this show is being hated as much as it should be..
Maheep is my FAVVVVV!
Guts!
i watched the whole season, not many please and thank yous said, learn some manners ladies
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9noRI6Vx0JM&amp;t=165">2:45</a> it is unbearable<br><br>!!EXACTLY!!
Enjoyed watching  the show.
Netflix please refund
Dear lady bring you husbands who are enlighten to warch
Bhavna is going to save Ananya&#39;s career
This is 😂 fail
Loved it , Eagerly waiting for season 2
Let&#39;s go get them dislikes.
Bro the amount of salty cunts in these comments... y’all need to check yourselves. I actually enjoyed the show and I’m hoping for a Season 2! Good to see more POC shows!!
ekta kapoor should take Maheep as some rich vamp saas role
When I see the comments, its all negative, they are like cheering on their own.
This is a great show! Why does everyone hate it?
When you except they&#39;ll throw some light  on to the lives of Gauri Khan, Twinkle Khanna, Kareena Kapoor khan, Mira Rajput but end up with people you didn&#39;t know even existed 😂😂....  its like ordering a pair of Reebok shoes and recieving Reedok instead....
Really loved the show. Different cast in second season will be even better! Not that I am saying these ladies are any lesser, just think they won’t have much more interesting content since the first season has pretty much covered that. Also, interesting will be to see bollywood actors lives.
Netflix should pull down this pathetic waste of time.
😂😂😂😂😂
Waiting for tanmay&#39;s reaction 😂😂
I loved the series. I found it entertaining. I loved to see how you live. Even if it is fictional, i liked it.
Why Netflix is just lowering their standard by keeping this show
Fakest show ever-u can&#39;t even try to copy Kardashian...
Idiots
Netflix India us kjo khajur ne kharid liya hai kya? Warna aise trashy shows Netflix allow kaise karta hai? Kuch to sharam Karo Netflix walo..inko to ane se rahi🙄
No hate but they are behaving so cringy , I seriously can&#39;t .......
Cringe content 101😂😂
bollywood sluts
they just want your attention cause at the end of the day as long as ppl are talking about them they&#39;ll get paid
Okay so I watched this series. It was a good laugh actually. Sure it was cringe and their kids are even cringier but I kinda liked this &quot;picture perfect life&quot; that they tried to show us lmao
Techniques to get out of a coma:<br>1. Smell dirty socks<br>2. See Ananya Pandey act<br>3. See fabulous lives of bollywood
The show is so ridiculous but I watched all the episodes soook
Nooooo woooohooooo haahhaaa idiots
Why rich aunties don’t have a sense of humour
Idk why but I actually like them and the show it is damn funny🤣
What a cringe show gross we just want Sanjay and Bobby kapoor
They have ex superstar husbands who seem comparatively less of a snob than these ladies have turned out to be..... like they have never even been to India...😂😂😂😂<br>Totally pretentious 👍👍👍
We kinda liked them before this show was on air 😂😂😂😂<br>Now we just like sanjay kapoor 😂😂👍
I struggled more than Ananya Pandey to watch this video
I love this show!! Reminds me of my besties😍😍
idiots.
Are these old Aunties abnormal or something, talking/ behaving like teenagers 😑👎
Fucking fakes
Issse acha toh bb dekhlo😂😂😂😂
Need pretentious Review for it.... Cringe@100
Effect of 2020 continuous...
Title should be &quot;Corona&quot;<br>😑😑😑
The best is neelam...so poised and calm and decent...maheep is so arogant and has a bad foul mouth all the time...what is she up to...
I loved the dislikes 🤣🤣🤣 mera desh badal rahaa hai agey baad raha hai
It’s hilarious how one of them has worn regular earphones and tucked the wires behind their head to make it look like AirPods 😂😂😂😂 so wannabe I can’t lmaoooo
Cheap and toxic
Well Maheep I&#39;ve watched with you injecting f..k and as.....e In every 3rd sentence Seema from Mumbai has a lot more class than you do oh I know trolling🤣🤣🤣
Lol
Seema the best very much real..<br><br><br>Best
Seema taparia from mumbai
All ladies without brains.... in this show..Indians are not interested in this hell
Good to ruin our culture
I loved it season 2 please
the people that actually enjoyed this show need serious help...theyre basically failures making a show of their own to gain some popularity. Im so glad im not in this bollywood mafia where everyone is just basic cut throat
Thee ladies are so triggering
Crapppppppp!!! Bad bad show
How can they be so RICH? Their Husbands been Unemployed for years 🙄
I didn&#39;t know this would happen, but somehow Maheep became my favorite. She is honest and cool. Intellectual badass kinda
Broke ass !!! Stick to your amazing culture and good language.  You are embarrassing yourselves !
Losers !!
What I hate is Arjun asking Maheep&#39;s kid if he wants to be an actor and he said yeah he wants to. I mean how easy it is for them to make that choice like they&#39;re buying vegetables. That&#39;s the privilege everyone says they get. Just sitting and saying ya I want to because it&#39;s so easy for him. Lol.
Ananya speaks like her mother.
Flop lives of flop actors ‼️🤬‼️👎
Only one word to say after watching it. YUCK!!!! 🤮🤮🤮
I watched it was so lovely
My mind is lyk my 😒😒
These women feel proud that they don&#39;t know Hindi, yet they&#39;re tryna launch their kids in this &quot;bollywood&quot; industry. <br>:) <br>Yes, I did see this on some other video, I thought it was funny so I&#39;m sharing it
Fun one time watch series. 4 women, unapologetic and just enjoying in their lives!!! 👍🏻👍🏻
Why Netflix
Alternative Title: The pretentious AF life of B grade Bollywood Actors wives😑
I only like neelam she is such a classy woman and sanjay wife such a foul mouth and arrogant
So lame!
full on cringe this garbage, iam out bitch
We miss Sanjay Kapoor&#39;s reaction to this! 🤣
Wasted time watching this
Neelam plz comeback ke mat sochna , plz rahem karo hum hindustanio per, vaise bhi bahut gandh aa rahi hai , ab plz tum mat aana
Can anyone please help me remove this thing from my suggestions in netflix...
I&#39;m in coma after watching this.
Tanmay and prashasti only reviewed Episode 1. May be they are still recovering😝
Netflix is loosing standards,time to unsubscribe
Nice
Wait!!! What is the motive of this show again???!!!🤔... Little bit more overacting, their english omg!!!! Let&#39;s first talk about gramma n pronounciation shall we.........😂
Patheeeetic.
Stop yelling..damn I have a headache  already..forget this, I am out!
I like the show.. as Indians we like looking into people&#39;s house specially celebrities and this show is giving us exactly that...
Absolutely came across as wannabee&#39;s
Only Seema looking younger among all
I watch all junk in 2x speed
Pathetic attempt to copy “House wives of Hollywood” etc.  But this such a laughing attempt really no class or real meaningful content just the v. v. v. poor attempt.
Can we get the season 2 already please thanks
Its funny that Bhavna Panday is way MORE likeable and tolerable than her daughter Ananya!
Cringefest!
What nonsense is this<br>Netflix is lowering its standards
Nonsense
What exactly have they done to deserve a show and attention?
Them laughing at their own scenes just says a lot about the show
As soon as she said I am Seema from Mumbai,  I started getting traumatic flashbacks from indian matchmaking
More than the video, here for the comments😂😂😂😂
After Tanmay&#39;s reaction😂😂
OMG...  How old do these aunties peg themselves to be? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😆😆😆
They tried to copy Kardashians but those women are actually self made millionaires and not <br>Like these husband dependent wives 🙄🙄
All these women ka husbands are jobless n yet they acting like billionaires😂😂😂
Their plastic surgeon is laughing his way to the bank 🤣🤣🤣
Are these shameless....? Who are these losers? With mere 5-10M , they acting like billionaires😂😂😂 As its said, Empty vessel makes more noise.
Randomly found this. Started the video. After 20 seconds, i was done. Disliked the video. Slapped myself 2-3 times. Moved on.
Idiotic content ...like Indian matchmaking ..with all the respect this is bollywood and not Indian Art Cinema! That is the difference ...you have meaningless bollywood movies/series or you have brilliant Indian Art Cinema! And the latest makes it to Emmy’s/Oscars like Delhi Crime ...and many more! As an audience you’re free to like or unlike but would rather spend my valuable time for good Indian Art Cinema that has also an impact towards society.
Zero self awareness!
Where did those accents come from ?!?!
Netflix, kya chod phela rha he idhr..
This web series more dangerous than cancer.
kash inhone jidgi dekhi hoti......ya kahe ki kash in log ne uple banaye hote to...thoda sahi mayne main khush hote...
RANDS OF KITTY PARTY
Netflix you’re bringing yourself down with this kind of shows are literally a disaster. Maintain your standards.
wow this is just sad... and these women so desperately want to make a fool of themselves in front of the entire world.. at least show some class if you actually consider yourself wealthy . What a garbage show.
No ways u are not even near to Beverly Hills housewives.... u guys suck.... don’t copy....
I don&#39;t understand how y&#39;all can hate this show. It&#39;s amazing! Yes their lives are different, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we attack them for it. Loved the show, in need of a second season!
People are thinking too much! I am just enjoying this show! It’s just the entertain value for me! Nothing much. These are the not so famous wives of not so famous bollywood husbands. So just let them have fun and shine for a change, God! People just need to take a chill pill!
Excited to watch this soon. Indian audience should welcome such show..like keeping up with kardishains.
Carryminati...ab to aja
Although I found the entire thing completely cringy and irrelevant, I do quite like Neelam, Bhavana and Seema as they were very down to earth. That Maheep on other hand, is completely crap, pretentious, and has absolutely no skills. Her shouting twats does not make any sense because although it is a British slang, she does not deliver it very well at all. In fact, it is embarrassing!! I think Maheep is very insecure because although being from Kapoor family, she is married to a flop kapoor brother and her daughter looks nothing like a Bollywood actress.
This show was basically done as a precautionary measure by Bollywood to safeguard themselves from Madhur Bhandarkars next film on Bollywood and drugs..jfyi😂
The funny thing is none of their husbands are working in Bollywood anymore 🤣🤣🤣🤣....the actual Bolly wives like Gauri, Twinkle, Mira, Genelia, etc. they will never do a show like this...appear in cameos for sure....but not sign up as main cast
Considering their husbands are out of work actors....sameer soni makes TV appearances ocassionally...how can they afford this type of lifestyle even if they are independantly earning?
OH GOSHH I CANNOT STAND MAHEEP!!!! swear to god she is the most annoying one on the show. Neelam and Bhavana are surprisingly nicer than the others, don&#39;t seem so stuck up/ entitled either
it is a completely a waste of time-poor presentation, it was meant to be a  realty based nonfiction show  but it was scripted
From this we got to know why there kids dnt know acting
The name should be miserable life of flop actors wife
Kaan phutt gae just bcz headphones lagae v theh
This Is An Actual WannaBe Show - Worst Is If You Can&#39;t Pull It Off Don&#39;t Do It Gurl Because You Will Only Look Silly &amp; Degrade Yourself Kisses 😘 Honey 😘
The whole industry is gone to the shits.
Netflix, kuwk was atleast interesting, THIS IS NOT. The acting is terrible and is forced kindly do not continue this.
Bhavna and Neelam are the only ones who don’t have attitude
Y arent all these wives not wearing masks..specially visiting Paris and visiting the Salon...tooo much🤔🤣
This show reminds me of some spoilt women at a kitty party which I attended only for a week. Those women are like these women. They are enjoying life because of their husbands. I felt sick and henceforth I quit attending such a snobbish kitty party. I would rather be build my identity by my hard work and talent than being known by my husband.
Shut up 🤐
Love the show!!! Keep it going ladies!!!
I loved the show! The connection between you all was lovely to see and made me message some of my close friends to hang out! The way you were with your partners and to see how understanding you were with your partners made me appreciate my girlfriend more and made me want to be nice to her and love her! I just loved it! And the episodes with Karan and Shah Rukh were just phenomenal! My favorite out of all was Maheep! She was fucking crazy!! And Neelam was so nice and refreshing. Bhaavna was brilliant and I related to her a lot and saw a lot of my mom in her. And oh my God, Seema was absolutely hilarious and breathtaking!! <br>Thank you for an amazing show!!
Oh my God!!!!!!!!! WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE WOMEN???
I loved it!! I don’t know why people are disliking it!!! ?
They are so stupid
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9noRI6Vx0JM&amp;t=3">0:03</a> one request for you as well , please read the comments down below
Not all Rich people are dumb this is just entertainment let them waste their money on stupid and unrealistic things but that is their life . Don’t hate and don’t be jealous ! If you don’t like it don’t watch
Rhea kapoor talk &amp; look like maheep kapoor.
O wow i loved maheep kapoor  and bhavna pandey mam i want to tell you your daughter is my favourite
As if the trailer was not enough cringe already...😂😂
Seriously stop with the cringe and dumb content Netflix. Also, this format of excessive lifestyle and money flaunting  ( Real Housewives, Kardashians etc) is  so passe! And this show is wayyyyy  wayyyy more tackier version of those. Yuck
I know many people are hating for this but I actually loved it for a change...with so much stress during this time due to various situations it was nice to watch some brainless stuff for a change lool
Seema Khan : All please watch fabulous lives of bollywood lives<br>Me: Netflix tere baap ka nahi hai
Great series! Looking forward to season 2.  Most appreciated about this show is that the drama/conflicts were real vs scripted like they are in America&#39;s Real Housewives franchises.   These women have 20+ years of history with one another, know who they are individually, and genuinely love and care for one another and their respective families. Makes for a more positive conflict resolution. <br><br>To Neelam....if you are actively rejoining the fraternity, why not a movie with SRK?  Surely he or KJo can make that assist.  Would love to see you back on screen!
Stupid show
I finished watching it yesterday itself ☺☺😍😍
It&#39;s like sasta version of keeping up with Kardashians🤦<br><br>Ps - very sasta
Netflix, you&#39;ll are doing very well even without shows like this and that Seema aunty show. Please don&#39;t dumb down yourselves.
Such foul mouthed women, reflects  wealth without education. Only neelam has grace and dignity of a well bred woman
Another seema from mumbai😳😳😳😳
Bloody aunties. Unwanted milfs
Tanmay reacts is must for it.
They are preparing Indian crowd for their kids when they make a debut in bollywood! RIP to all of us
Someone please give these women a thesaurus - I’m sick of “fab” and “fabulous”
&quot;Hi guys, i am seema from mumbai&quot; in the intro.<br>Well well, i see what u did there.🤦‍♂️🙄
I spent my entire day watching each n every bit of the show just to make myself feel bad for struggles in lives of us actual Indian population and Netflix is releasing the life of some middle aged aristocratic ladies telling they are proud of their kids for what!!! This is not real Indian lifestyle.. This is not the struggle to be proud of.. Indian population should really change their mindset...<br>But the show is glamorous and I felt all four women were genuine about their feelings because they don’t know what struggle is and what is being proud of,.. So nothing harsh to say about them.. But Netflix should refrain encouraging aristocracy 😀I really laughed hard Sanjay Kapoor explaining his struggle in a swanky awesome restaurant..That’s not struggle dear Sanjay sir...<br>But I really loved watching each n everyone of them to be frank... 🥰🥰🥰I loved how lucky they r for their lifestyle..In a nutshell,they r just lucky not someone to be proud of..
Loved the show😂❤️
No more cringe content please.
This show is the reason I cancelled my Netflix Subscription
nobody gives 2 fucks aunties
High class randiya
I think they thought fans of kyunki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi are Netflix subscibers... Bad customer targeting... Please leave Netflix go to starplus... U will be loved there
This was such an iconic show. Season 2 please!!!
Watch only for SRK
the best actor in this show goes to sanjay Kapoor for &quot;thank God&quot; not pretending to act but to portray himself. imagine if Sanjay kapoor is best actor then whats the shows actor value<br>.<br>Sometimes u watch a show just because u know u won&#39;t watch it more than 5 minutes...but frankly I am into episode 2 already
Please look at the point I’m hinting out. Then you’ll realise why this show was made. <br>1) shooting in Doha (why not any other country? Bcoz this show was made during lockdown) <br>2) neelam trying to come back to acting is only to bring audience back to watching movies again bcoz she was once loved by many. <br>3) gauri khan throwing a party. (Only to show that they don’t use drugs in parties and how normal their parties are!)<br>4)at the end of the show it shows that the girls connect via video call during lockdown. But did you guys notice a maid walking around the house during their video call! I thought no one was working in their house 👀<br><br>The shooting was done during quarantine and they managed to make it look like it was done before it! All lies if they can buy the cops then they can do anything. This is all to show how everything that has been said about them in the media is a lie. Such as drugs, ssr, child trafficking! Don’t fall this show! It was well planned but no one is stupid
All the Aunty&#39;s 😂😂😂
Fun show to watch! Keep it up!
Nobody asked for this show. Nobody asked for this reaction video.
Ghatiya thuuuuuuu hatttt
Netflix is surging depths of pathetic abyss
Just watched...excellent job. Loved the show!
Money can&#39;t buy class after all😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9noRI6Vx0JM&amp;t=116">1:56</a> I no longer need my job thanks to, <b>p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m</b>
Am not watching this show.. With stolen name... How about you
Loved it.. better than the silly Kardashians
The show is super cringe!
Must watch series better than RHOB series these girls are real and amazing.  Please make season 2 so worth it!! Love Maheep n Seema they are rocking
This is worst than tiktok India...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9noRI6Vx0JM&amp;t=36">0:36</a> I stopped my work with the help of, <b>p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m</b>

Embarrassing.
🤢guttter
to be honest it was fun watching them
Why Netflix India is degrading quality, such worse show.....should immediately stop.
Overacting ki dukaane
Abhi pata star kids ka cringe kaha se aata hai
Netflix India you just lost the fabulous subscribers
Can someone please only tell me in which episode gauri and srk are there please
A couple of rich people doing rich stuff...I would definitely want to sit through eight episodes of that : /
Give us good shows, Netflix. Noone wants to watch this crap.
Couldn&#39;t watch it for more than 15 mins... They tried to copy KARDASHIANS but failed miserably 😑👎
Ananya could not act and earn money,so her mom came as a substitute.😂
It was all so glossy, plastic and so unreal 🙄 so much pressure they undergo to look perfect and do all sorts of botox or whatever..... Nerve wrecking..... Gauri looks so uninterested... 😂😂 Srk as usual came up with those filmy dialogues...... The only person who seemed real was Samir..... Oh and Maheep and her foul fithy mouth.....
Cringy stuff no one gonna watch this
Chu panti
Honestly in the whole garbage show i want to see SRK&#39;s part nothing else
annoying
This makes me sick.. And how pathetic
Now Bollywood is promoting themselves by this cheap show.
This sounds like a copy of real housewives
Neelam kothari doesn&#39;t seem rich her house is very upper middle class No offence
i feel sorry for one in blue. She doesn&#39;t even have enough money to buy wireless airpods. What a peasant! Airpods first, Botox later!!!
As if this pandemic was not enough🙄🙄
Netflix is out of content
Why would one watch a bunch of talentless people with hereditary wealth...
Agar nolan inception daikhaiga to Kia wo yah kahayga this was my favorite scene ?
Yehi 4 aurtie dekengi apna show 😂😂<br>No one is interested in the show. Tera btotx dekke hum kya karenge.<br>What is outstanding in getting an old woman get botoxed?
Sence the government is a conglomerate banking institution financed by taxpayers monies that are mandatory there should be a department dedicated to handle the returns on our mandatory investment but the language is not their they don&#39;t see our money as an investment they see it as a commitment should the citizens damand the same kind of commentment at least in times like these they don&#39;t pay as much as we do but they control it more than we do
Who are they?
OMG! This is so cringey!<br><br><br><br><br>I love it!
@Tanmany Bhat where you at?!
lost my 4 brain cells.... Pray for me
Gharelu baatein among wives
Wifes for unsuccessful heros but best friends of madam karan. Shitty series
Looks like glam + real life and for us to understand what goes  in their life. At the end they all people with family and work  like us.
Why so much hate towards this ladies they are intelligent and normal.Dont expect everyone to behave like the way we wanted
Funny how this show is releasing on the day I should get my first period, but as of 1:14 PM, neither has arrived
Netflix bringing cringe to the platform and Tanmay Bhat reacting to it, seems working for  Netflix.
i just have one thing to say- cheap
<b>FEMINISM IS ON PECK LEVEL</b>
Netflix you are blocked for this suggestion !
When its gona live? Timing?
I&#39;m gonna only watch this one because of srk and gauri cameo in it 😌❤
Why Netflix India why are you degrading your quality?
Racist content
Seriously Netflix??? Netflix india standards are going down day by day
&quot;One of the people who like this you will be a billionaire one day&quot;<br>&quot;Good luck,:.😂😂😂..
Why you&#39;r not stop your piracy many apps give free access to all the content you have
&quot;&#39;Affirming words from moms and dads are like light switches. Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child&#39;s life and it&#39;s like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities.&quot;&quot;
Bhavana seems to be the most normal person <br>Others r just too much
सभी को मेरा प्रणाम 🙏<br>जी मैं Singing करता हूं।।।<br>Singer बनना चाहता हूं ।।<br>और अपनी मां का सपना पूरा करना चाहता हूं।।।  मेरे तरफ से एक कोशिश है मेरे गाने की प्लीज एक बार मेरे फोटो को क्लिक करके मेरी सॉन्ग को सुन लीजिए और मुझे बताइए मैंने कैसा गया<br>Please support kijiye please apka time West nhi Hoga pkka promish 🙏 please
Waiting for Tanmay&#39;s reaction
I need to watch altered carbon to nullify the effect this shitty show has had on my brain.Wish me luck
Is tht anushka sharma?! 😂 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9noRI6Vx0JM&amp;t=37">0:37</a>
