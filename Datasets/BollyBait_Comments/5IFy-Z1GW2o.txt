‘Stash’ of Palkova🥸🤔
U love the way she actually said dosa and not dhh-oosa 😂
The girl&#39;s camera is too lame (budget)
you can see a reflection of Sridevi ji in Janhvi , not as an actor but as a person.
She knows very much about food
Jahnvi is a real foodie and beautiful
She never fails to mention her love for her maternal home Chennai, Tirupathi and the things she love about South India whenever possible. Good that her Momma made her experience her side of culture as well.
Oh my..no show off..I mean,not sure why celebrities don&#39;t want to show their south Indian base or comnect..<br>Even for that matter,may be,Sridevi but this girl was so blant..so transparent or rather didnt know to b diplomatic n show off her north indian..punjabi roots also.<br>God bless u Jhanvi n best wishes!!
She doesnt like to talk about movies but she likes to talk about food
I never saw the anchor ate any food in his interviews .. hope he don’t waste food
Did they even eat half the time?
Finally an actress with a nice personality
Janhvi kapoor❤
Yaa toh kha lo ya baat karlo..khaane ki insult hai yeh wait krana..aisa meri mummy bolti hai..chappal padti mujhe agr main yeh karti ..
I thought her tamil connect died when Sridevi died. Boy am i wrong!<br>High time Kollywood gets her in a movie. We can say <br>&quot;The Prodigal daughter returns&quot; :D<br>Love JK :)
I like the fact tht she&#39;s using her hands to eat 😁
Absolutely adore jahnvi but the interviewer did so good too!
she z a very gd gal
malai n cream r the same
Kini: I was playing kalla police<br>😂❤
She is intelligent and talented.
After i saw the food: omg, are they going to eat ethg? <br>After i hear &quot;fridge&quot;: ohh okay, send it to me xD<br>Omg...how i miiiissed such shows and the funny site of the stars. So cute to see how normal n not perfect they are in real life.
The fact that we were taught to not talk while eating in nursery is funny
Man she looks so disinterested. Ugh
People who disliked the video are a bunch of losers! 🤧
She so cute and innocent yaar.i love her a lot 😘😘 mai ne aj tak aisi ladki nhi dekha in this whole industry
I am watching these videos eating parata
They should act in a romantic movie together
Palkova ,mysorepak, dhosa ! Her pronounciation was pure south indian !!!
Looking at two South Indians talking about food, cool
why am I shipping these two lol
Let&#39;s just agree that kinni&#39;s choice of food is always Better than the guests.
Glad she is much of South Indian  and her cuisine tastes of south Indian foods is good.. I hope she marries a South Indian and settles down south
She is very genuine person ❤️
I’m more South Indian than Punjabi , that sounds awesome
This one should have had a million views already ... such a nice interview and they were so comfortable
This guy sounds like Kenny Sebastian a lot.
aviyal.....keralite dish....
Oh we couldn&#39;t think of &quot;malai&quot; ... Subscribe! 👍🏽 🙈🤣🤣🤣
Looks like so much food is wasted guys...one man&#39;s food is not so much right.. especially Jahnvi&#39;s...you could have taken small portions of every item
Please type Damaru Kathak Kendra and watch my dance tribute to Sridavi ji.♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
She never had jalebi before this interview I mean what my guilty pleasure is jalebi
Nikhil has a crush
Wannabe host, sooo annoying
The Lassi edit though 😭😭😭😭😭
Nikhil mentioning &quot;Kalla Police game&quot; that was soo apt..as a child I&#39;m sure 90&#39;s kids have played this game atleast once!!
Princess 🤗🤗👸🌹
Please people,she is an amazing person
This interview was mouthwatering <br>Literally
Better suited cheated on acting in Kargil girl😂
Jhanvi comes across as such a simple person! Rather than blame star kids, they should retrospect and think that they are also somehow responsible for the film makers choices. People are obsessed with star kids and that’s the reason film makers prefer them over talented outsiders. Best example is Taimur. That kid was famous from the time he was born. The day public gets rid of their curiosity for star kids film makers will give opportunities to everyone alike.
Wonderful and very entertaining interactive. Both are genuine.
He talks exactly like kenny Sebastián.
Like for Nikhil, i don&#39;t know and don&#39;t care who is the girl
I lovehhhh tirupati 😌😌😍🥰🥰that&#39;s enough
😂😂😂😂♥️♥️♥️
She is a powerful girl. I like watching her. You will be a superstar one day girl I believe .
The menu please episodes have a very hot ones feels. The questions Nikhil ask are so smart and the conversations are getting more and more interesting. I would love if it becomes  like the Indian version of Hot ones
I think janhvikapoor loves lassi.
I really wish she was my bestfriend 😭 a foodie, movie buff , funny and a genuine hardworking girl 💜 I really dunno why she gets so much hate compared to sara and ananya!
Malayi is cream! Can I be a troll for a minute, and point out that, she spoke about hard work, when she was given a platform, where she is literally the epitome of privilege of having a superstar mother in southern films and Bollywood and a father who is a producer in Bollywood! And she pronounces tangy ( tang gee) not tanji! Lol
She has 500 dishes on her table and all she&#39;s doing is the taste test...huh
She&#39;s so sweet and seems like a genuinely good human being.
i llike that they are using their hands to eat ....no spoons :)
Neer dosa 😍
I am like why does she like south indian food so much like that is surprising! then I remember Shri devi mam !!<br>(i am not saying its not tasty i love it i am a south indian myself)
For everyone praising janvi..dude she became like this after Sara&#39;s fame bcz of her cuteness overacting....she just wants that fame too!!
Love Jhanvi
She is eating with hands ❤️
Nice .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IFy-Z1GW2o&amp;t=733">12:13</a> lmao soooo relatable
The best interview ive ever seen
This seems more like a virtual date
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IFy-Z1GW2o&amp;t=414">6:54</a> That statement so applies to Sara Ali Khan someone go beat some sense into that girl🙄
Wait why did people ever hate her?
I used to hate her..but after seeing this i feel that she is more genuine and innocent person..whereas sara is a strategic person..
Maybe a good person but not meant for films. Lacks acting skills.
Love janhvi
The Palakova that she is talking about is seriously amazing. I love having that while climbing to Tirupati.
I don&#39;t follow her on any social media platform but she is very real and honest that&#39;s for sure
Wow. . both looks so cute ❤️
that&#39;s a big cheat day
Log janvi kapoor ko khamakhai itna hate karte hai yaar.She is so genuine yaar.woh itna hate nahi deserve karti.Isme uski kya galti ki woh star kid hai.
She&#39;s adorable
I love janhavi&#39;s personality
Janhvi  totally useless
Jhanvi is kind of actor who admires cinema, if I&#39;m correct. She will watch and learn the craft. She will watch more Oscar nominated movies, more classics, more drama movies, and will learn from it more. <br>Whereas Ananya Pandey is this gen wanna be actor who won&#39;t try to watch any good movies, but will mostly watch chick flick movies and show that are only fun to watch.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IFy-Z1GW2o&amp;t=308">5:08</a> aiyoo
From childhood it&#39;s taught don&#39;t talk while eating.. And after grown up.. Here you go... 😂😂
Yarr Vrat hai ... Mat karo na😒
who else felt like the interviewer was kind trying to  hit on her
Worst actor is u and don&#39;t remember ur mother as the best actor 🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🖕👌🤛🤛🤛🤛🤛🤛🤛🤛
I honestly prefer her so much over Sara. I mean her aura just seems so genuine and sweet. She’s shy but that’s what I love about her. Unlike Sara who tries to be over the top and goes crazy over Kareena kapoor khan. Jhanvi has such good knowledge about the industry. She deserves a lot of love!
her skin looks like korean
I&#39;m big fan of Jhanvi mam
Strugler pad ki mushk wali tati janvi
Challl daffa ho nepotism product
This is like copying Sherry&#39;s Mukbang with Sherezad Shroff
Why the hell ppl watching and commenting. Watcha Nd then report. This is the only thing we can do at the moment. What is happening with you indian ppl. Are you all sold out. Why we have to remind you all about Sushant incident. Let&#39;s just report any channel that shows Nepo kids
When Kenny has more expressions that Miss. Nepotism
I feel he was forced to say that &quot; India&#39;s promising young talent &quot;
💩🦧👑💰👎🤮🤧🤮👎
ooo myyy gosshhhhhh!!!! can anyone be so gorgeous !!!!!!! &lt;33333
Jhanvi is eventually winning hearts over hate!! Love her spirit :)
I can feel tension of Kini and Janhvi from screen
Omg she is soooo beautiful ❤❤❤❤
Do it with sara
Malai seriously.......... True example of CRINGE * 100
The lovely Janhvi
Wo sab thik he , but please movie me acting mat karna . Kiyu ki acting me tumhe bilkul v nehi aati....
Every where I saw a meme on her that she don&#39;t know how to act , than i watched gunjan saxena... Damn she really is Talentless.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣her expressions, dialogue delivery.. 🤣🤣🤣
I love Kini but still gonna dislike cause netflix brought in The fuckin film
The South Indian spin in this episode was great. Couldn&#39;t miss that Aiyyo!
Kalla police,kannadiga
Janhvi is soooooooooooooooooo cute😆😘😘😍
NEOPTISM OP, no hate to Kinny, bro love your videos came from the Dosa episode, but it is what it is.
Lovevyou jahnu
Mooh me paani aaraha he yaar sabhi ko dekke yaar sachme lovevyou
Itna bada interview de rahe but SSR ke baare me kuch nahi bol rahi.
Bhuki bhikaran<br>Drug <a href="http://khale.report/">khale.report</a> this video
Bhag padree nepotism badsurat drug addict
saxenas are not punjabi
When she said palkova my south indian heart said yayyy❤️❤️ it&#39;s my favorite too
She&#39;s such a sweet girl❤️❤️
Janhvi is loveeeee
She is a sweet soul but she definitely needs some acting classes
I love this comment section..only opinions without hate!👌🏽 why can‘t we always be like this? watch the content and then build an opinion based on the video and not hating random people for their names or looks
Very mean of him to assume she&#39;ll make her father watch high school musical to improve upon her craft.
Nikhil said Kalla police 😂😂😂
I used to dislike her alot, even now I wouldn&#39;t say that she is a very good actor, but as a person I have started liking her and feel like she is warm &amp; friendly and humble. Maybe an introvert but certainly not deserving so much hate. Now people would say Sara is way better and cheerful and well-informed, but I feel Sara is more strategic as a person, Sara knows how to answer questions, where to be diplomatic, where to give fun answers and very very matured in her approach. She is never awkward in her interviews and never fumbles. So compared to that, Jhanvi is more natural and awkward during interviews and thats very real about her.
Saxena&#39;s are not Punjabi. 🙈
Lassi and South Indian were hints Nikhil couldn&#39;t pick.
Fck nepotism
Though I personally do not like her acting and films but she is a lovely person in general. Hope she grows up as an actor
he : &#39;promising young talent&#39; <br>me : loda mera
No one:<br>Literally no one:<br>Kini: High School Musical 😂
I really hate u jhanvi
Kalla police is the highlight 🤣
She said “aiyyo” . She is a pure South Indian :)
Got to know so kore in this interview man🔥🔥❤❤❤
How adorable this girl is...love you jahnavi...shows your upbringing....you deserve lots of love..
I&#39;m also not against Nepotism it&#39;s everywhere, even ishaan her first costar is a nepo kid have you ever seen any negative Comment about his acting? No! Because he can act!!!! He overshadowed janhvi in dhadak, she looked completely expressionless and bland there!!! In Bollywood either , looks works or acting and she has none, getting multiple movies and followers in the name of her mother isn&#39;t even an achievement!!!!  What&#39;s her achievement apart being sridevi&#39;s daughter? Hrithik Roshan is a starkid but he has his own identity, he was really good from his first movie itself!!! Vivek Oberoi and ishaan khatter also nailed their respective characters from their respective first movies so there shouldn&#39;t be an excuse she&#39;s new or learning when we all know , 1000times better naturally good looking and talented girls are struggling to even get an advertisement in Mumbai whereas she&#39;s getting fame and name due to her surname!
Feels so good to see so much love for janhvi in the comments
what its called.. Ur appans Kunnna.. Poori mole
ANOTHER STAR KID ON another interview  giving  details of her menu ,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nepokids">#nepokids</a>  what she eats is the chance of a lot strugglers form making their mark i indian industry
He sounds like a banglorean..and looks a lil bit like Kenny Sebastian..
jahnvi is really really beautiful and talented actress😍....i am gonna wish to watch her movie soon...😍😍
Behen ko malai nahin pata and she wants to portray decorated Air force officer!!!
Nonsense.<br>Havldar Jhanvi kapoor
Like her love for food is so intense and it shows through her descriptions
She loves food so damn much man wow
Oh pls.........he didn&#39;t even had his meals.......🤭🤭🥺🥺
Janhvi would be a great writer.
@5.09 to 5.13 😘😘😘😘😘 <br>Her laugh is so cute
It&#39;s so annoying to watch or even a look at that SARA AK. So much overrated and hyped. <br>But look at this sweet girl. She is 10000 times better than her. No attitude very humble genuine down to earth. Having same paratha for last night&#39;s dinner, putting the leftover food in the fridge, she didnt even changed the plate and have all meal in one plate all this just simply shows her simplicity. She dont have that &#39;I am star&#39; vala attitude. She behaves so normal n natural like any other common people. And that laugh n that hichki 😘😘 I really liked her.
She is so sweet ! Natural genuine and so calm with zero attitude unlike that SARA. <br>Janhavi the way she talks is so sweet and calm. The way she is mentioning the food and it&#39;s details shows how foody she is. <br>I watched her interview for the first time. I don&#39;t know about the movie but she as a person is very sweet and calm n without filters. 😍
I know janhvi mam is too different as compare to another starkids,,,,,,
Instead of spreading hate everywhere, why don&#39;t u all go support talented actors? This hate bandwagon has to stop. Yes, the star kids had easy paths in their life, and they need to realize that, but that doesn&#39;t mean u can go on abusing someone. They have dreams too. Why Should they give up everything? At the same time, we need to support and watch talented movies, doesn&#39;t matter if there&#39;s a star cast or not. WE MUST SUPPORT TALENT. Stop the hate please.
She&#39;s so cute. She doesn&#39;t deserve the hate.
Is this Janhvi&#39;s house?
This is my favorite show!
Saxena are kayastha not punjabi
Awwww
I love this star kid
i knew theres no way shed eat all that . she took one bite and thats it haha
This was so much fun to watch!❤️ The &quot;aiyyo&quot; and love for Chennai ❤️😭! Waay too relatable! I always liked her,but this just took it to another level. I feel so bad that she&#39;s hated and trolled so much for no fault of hers..☹️ Hope people stop hating her and start to see how wonderful a person she is off screen. On screen of course there&#39;s a lot of scope for improvement but she has never denied it herself. She doesn&#39;t at all have the attitude of a &quot;star kid&quot;.  Just watch Ananya or Alia giving interviews and you will know what I mean!
like her having the food using hand...not to show-off or saying hygiene etc.,
Jhanvi: gonna have this now <br>Kini: just switching plates without eating
The irony is this interview is themed as food and  they didn&#39;t even finish a single food properly specially the guy so not fair sajane ke liye rakha hai kya.  to watch them binging like this 😋🥺
She has a good personality but she is not a good actor
How adorable jhanvi is! 🤩 I adore her the way she explains about movies and her clarity on foods. She&#39;s totally different from other new generation. Actors. Loved Loved her ❣️ eagerly waiting to see her in more movies. She deserves all success and happiness in her profession and real life. Sending lot&#39;s of happiness and prayers to all the viewer&#39;s from Pakistan. 🙋💓✨
Your accent is similar to Kenny Sebastian
Jhanvi is the most humble and real compared to other star kids
Aapke paas phone number hai Jhanvi didi ka mujhe larkamat smajhna I am girl ye mere papa ka mobile haihor mere papa ki sadi ho gayi hai
Why is this boy so cute
Palkova... Mysore pak.. Tirupati..  Chennai.. Roja.. Rahman.. 🔥🔥🔥
he talks like kenny
Keeping the nepotism aside i personally feel she is too innocent
She is better in person than her acting in Gunjan Saxena 😂 I wish her enthusiasm for food would have reflected in her acting 🤣
The host is damn awkward I feel
Janhvi is love ❤
Janhvi is so cute and beautiful, I love janhvi 😘😘😍😍😍
Idk still not seeing her struggling enough for me. The fight continues.
Isnt cream and malai the same ??😐
I read the article on gujan saxena formor colleges talking about how the script is all inaccurate and saying all kind of things about the movie, I think she is saying the true plus I don&#39;t like nepotism so this movie is a big Big no, specially when it is spreading lies about real living people
I am a vegetarian Punjabi who would die for good South Indian food. I love puttu and kadala curry. Haye Rabba
finally people giving Janhvi the love she deserves!
Not interested not interested not interested
I ship them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IFy-Z1GW2o&amp;t=114">1:54</a> Gunjan Saxena is a Kayasth, not Punjabi!
Nepotism
She is such a lovely woman. I love to watch her.
Jahnvi is genuinely a sweet girl
It&#39;s really so funny that..now a days people have forgotten basic manners that to not talk while eating..
Netflix ka promotion bhi kiya.
❤️
This is so cute uff
She has the most amazing  real laugh..this girl is love 😍😍😍
I heard a bit of her mom&#39;s voice and style of talking in her speech and it kind of broke my heart a little
what a rubbish actress.
Her voice is like Sri Devi, beautiful 💞
She&#39;s so pretty, talented, humble and kind, she&#39;s leggit guys.
Nikhil is like v have discovered the word &quot;malai&quot; so subscribe😂
Janvi is honestly the chill foodie person like all of us.... Man, her personality is a vibe..... We all have been like her at least once ❤️❤️
No nepotism comments...come on guys where are hate comments??<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nepotismoverrated">#NepotismOverrated</a>

Felt that he was slightly condescending ngl
Mark my words this girl will one day remove all the hate for herself from all the people hearts .. cz she is honest , wise and genuinely interested in working in this industry ..no tantrums at all and above all she is very hard working. she will grow as an actor day by day and reach heights..
Feel baby
They&#39;re wasting so much food😂
I love you jaanvi mam
Follow my page for beautiful clothing collection @pretty_classiest @prettyclassiestwestern
Good one! They actually ate😂❤<br>Unlike so many other videos where the food just sits on the table untouched.<br>She&#39;s very genuine 🤗
Where&#39;s the neer dosa he spoke of?
She is sucha genuine person and her innocence truely comes across loved this episode ❤ so chilled out and sucha foodie 😊😎
I don&#39;t know about the movie but seriously janvi is a beautiful....
Funny she didn&#39;t include her mother in the list of actors who inspired her. Sridevi was one of the finest actors and her comedic timing is still unmatched in India. Otherwise Jhanvi comes across as a natural person and not a put on.
Kini is just a lame host... He is not even funny
Dude, that Bangalore accent is sweet<br>&quot;What?! You slept in a chopper?&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62lCMaS59jU">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=62lCMaS59jU&amp;t=21s%20share%20and%20subscribe%20to%20my%20youtube%20channel%20d%203020%20share%20and%20subscribe%20to%20my%20youtube%20channel%20d%203020</a>
She genuinely seems like a vryy sweet person ❤
Actually Gunjan saxena is kayastha not punjabi .😊
The most down to earth, rich girl I&#39;ve ever seen. So grounded and so keen to learn more. Her parents raised her well.
Abhi bhi star kids ko hi promote kr rahe hai 👎👎👎👎
she is so sweet
I really like her....
Starkids have to struggle to remember malai
Probably only person who said &quot;dosa&quot; And not dhosa!
Cringy, rot acting both of you
Loved the interview
Janvi love you dear aap bahoooooot ache lagate ho aap bahoooooot bade banoge aap ne gunjan saxsena mai bahoooooot achaaaaa kaam kiya hai best janu gunju
Jhanvi is pure mood ❤
When did a Saxena become a Punjabi 🙄???Mr kini pls try and get the pronounciation of Dhadak correct 🤓
Dear Netflix India, please hire better hosts for your shows, Gunjan Saxena is not Punjabi, the host is making the comment of Gunjan being punjabi is highly uninformed.....atleast do some homework before hosting a show
so glad.. she is still privileged
❤
She is really passionate about food and she is clearly closer to her south Indian side .of course due to her incredible mother 😊
❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ for jhanvi
I could sense some chemistry between these two, don&#39;t know how ??<br>But yeah, I did !!
The subtitles are not wanted. I can&#39;t concentrate on the food while they talking
Its damnn trueee...<br>Chillies outside India aren&#39;t spicy at allll, at allllll....<br>When u will ask them for the spiciest ones, they&#39;ll be like omg all thsee chillies are hot...good luck and the moment u eat it, our like khichadi is better than this😂😂😂😂😂...i think sooo manii punjabizz can relate to this😅😅
Gunjan is not Punjabi she is kayasth🤦
<b>Nikhil seemed a little bit shy</b> 😜
Kya disconnection hai Jhanvi ka reality se, she didn&#39;t even know what&#39;s malai... <br>Side effects of nepotism.
How can someone eat while talking a lot...
The way she describes her food, with SO much conviction, crazy wow.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IFy-Z1GW2o&amp;t=470">7:50</a> Dat fake laugh 🙄🙄 of d guy. He is pretending to be amused while he is clearly not.
Love how this video has so many positive comments about her❤️
Promising Young talent.....ohhhhh sigh...kini its ok i know you had to do coz of netflix😂💩
Lovely and very innocent Janhvi❤
So cute💛
When she started talking about films and character and actors that influenced her I thought she will Def say alia and one of her films but suprised that she didn&#39;t unlike that fake ananya or anyone else
Stop<br>This<br>Now a new industry is borned called nepotismwood industry<br>And we all have to finish it🙅
Great
Aiyyo💙
However much you criticize &quot;star kids&quot;, I just cannot not like Jahnvi, especially because I know how hard working and dedicated she is towards her craft. Same goes for people like Ishaan Khattar and Babil Khan.
how insensitive...
Janhvi all the time : foodie foodie foodie         Also Janvhi : I have never had a jalebi before.  <br>What?
Omg I am from tirupathi..and our go to sweet is palkova and mysorepak...climbing Tirumala hills is our only adventorus thing and vacation while growing up..
Kitna apne papa ka kahegi
Loosers
I&#39;m 100% sure both of them would&#39;ve jumped on the food when the interview got over
46 k view..and 315 comments...so pr team deleted all negative ones....
She’s so cute and seems so genuine!
The anchor sounds soo much like kennyyyyy
Her simplicity and sweet nature takes my heart 💓💓
This is an amazing interview, first time I liked her too!! 💕
Going to Tirupati and Tirumala with family once a year was like ritual for me.(Holiday and piligrimage) Really miss that trip this year. Im sure Janhvi would have visited too to pray for her movie..
I LOVEEEE HER &lt;333 :&quot;(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IFy-Z1GW2o&amp;t=275">4:35</a> 😂😂😂
Wamod wamod wamod wamod wamod......
Wamod
I like her a litlle better after watching this interview...
She is lovely n I love her.
Army loves subscribe may channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSVDjXwulRs">https://youtu.be/uSVDjXwulRs</a>
I love janhvi and this interview 😍😍
Sword art online hindi dubbed
THE HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL REFERENCE! AAAH!
Did Nikhil even eat anything?
Janhvi Kapoor ❤❤❤😘😘
She seems like a very genuine and fun person. I don&#39;t know how I feel about her acting but I&#39;ll sure as hell love to see her in more videos like this.
Hoggers lol ❤🤣 like me. 😀
Me at the end.. Kalakand toh kya nhi 😂
Tnx Janvi for Gunjan Suxena 💙💙💙<br><br>Its a treat watch really loved it...
She&#39;s such a lovely and genuine person 😍 she doesn&#39;t deserve the hate guys
Latika<br><br>Only bb fans will get this
❤🧡❤🧡
Nikhil Kini can&#39;t believe you pronounced Kalla Police like a North Indian. Yaake?
She&#39;s so nice and friendly!! Unlike other star kids she&#39;s so inclined towards films and cinema😍 hope people can actually start focusing on hard work rather than her hereditary and stop targeting humble people like her 👍🏼
Even a man who has eaten a lot would feel hungry after seeing this ....😂😂
so pure ❤️
She&#39;s the best tbh 🌟😀✨
Привет джанви.
She&#39;s cute kind person ❤ loving daughter jk...
LoL 🤣 is she a Talented actress ? Buttering it
I am From Tirupati.
<b>Gunjan Saxena Me Jhanvi ki Jageh Agr</b><br><b>Sraddha Hoti To Bhot Accha Rehta</b><br><br>Agree ? 😊😊
Ayyo- Sounds like typical south indian😀😀
The fact that she&#39;s so well informed about movies, especially all the old and new ones as well and food, shows that she&#39;s very determined to do well in movies and work as hard as possible, the way she talks about her co-stars and movie characters, and on top of that she has no attitude and is so down to earth and humble, she doesn&#39;t deserve the hate tbh
Malai nhi pata iss angrezan ko
Did he just say Promising new talent? The physical manifestation of talent cried in the corner after that statement.
After having this meal, Nikhil is going to look like endgame&#39;s Thor
She is so cute . Love you janhvi stay happy always. My favorite
Such a pleasant and cheerful personality- really don’t think she deserves the hate she gets.
Honestly Gunjan Saxena was an amazing movie❤️ idk why IMDB gave it such low ratings! I loved the movie and Jahnvi’s acting was also improved💗
Wow she can&#39;t even remember the word  malai 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
Janhavi seems quiet real and natural. I think she&#39;s a very lovely person
I didn&#39;t buy it when she said she feels more South Indian but then she instinctively said &quot;aiyyo&quot; after the hiccup and I was like &#39;thats my tamizh ponnu&quot;
love Jaanvi so much
Netflix always promoting nepotism kids.
You know she is the one when she is a Punjabi foodie but still says &quot;Aiyoo&quot; with a sudden hiccup ! ❤️✨

I watched gunjan saxena and<br>It will be succesfull and will be blockbuster
She is lovely..
The interviewer is funny and jahnvi seems very natural. It was a good interview ❤️
What kind of a dumbass cant even remember the word malai. I know how to say it in atleast 3 languages. These star kids are so stupid!
He said &quot;PLEASE DON&#39;T DIE ON THIS SHOW&quot; oh my god 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was hoping for a food challenge and seeing jahnavi struggle completing the meal.... disappointed
Taj Coromandel management after watching this :<br>Firing the new Chef for not giving the Tiramisu to her.😂
Janhvi.😍😍😍
She is amazing 😍😍😍
Love her😍😍😍
Goddamnit Netflix! Atleast let the person finish speaking before your outro!
Jhanvi dialect is more of a Foreigner than Indian..She needs to drop this side to connect with the masses
Wao Amazing. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nadeemvlogs">#nadeemvlogs</a>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycott">#Boycott</a> Nepotism
From Acting &amp; Expression sy she is like real sister of Arjun Kapoor😎😎
My only concern &quot;you don&#39;t talk in cheat meals, you eat a cheat meal &quot;
Jhanvi seems like a real foodie from heart. The way she talks about food vs she talks about movies? Definitely the former!! Haha!!
Jesus .... malai and cream are the fucking same!
she is cute,  so positive

I think she is the best star kid

Most unpromising

Feels more like a date than an interview she&#39;s looks soo comfortable....
Literally the 1% people who&#39;s reading...  May your parents live more than 100 years with good health
Literally 1% of the people who reading the comment.<br>May God 🙏 fulfill all their wishes <br>And provide a healthy life 🙂
Love janvi♥️
I love her clearity on food.... She is like me describing food to my friends
That &quot;Aiyoo&quot; though😁😁♥️
TBH , the extreme hate that she gets personally is so odd and wrong .
Starkid
&quot;one of India&#39;s most promising young talents&quot; 🙄🙄

We don&#39;t wanna know🤷
One thing to all the anti-nepotism <i>activists</i> out there, you aren&#39;t wrong. Your idea isn&#39;t wrong. The problem is, the ^products^ of nepotism that you guys are aiming at, are like toddlers in kindergarten who know they have made a mistake but they dont know how to tackle it. It isn&#39;t their fault they are privileged and several steps ahead of even more talented people who are supposed to be taking their place. If you want to show them or prove to them their <b>worth</b> then please do so by supporting any underrated or newcoming good actors, not by pulling these <i>nepos</i> down. The sad thing though is that from now on any famous artist&#39;s children will be scared to ever dream of being an artist if they want to become one because they will be targeted for something their parents should be held accountable for. That&#39;s what sucks. There is sooo much opposition and friction causing an imbalance in the industry. I hope justice prevails.
