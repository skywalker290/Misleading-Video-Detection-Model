You missed so many scenes of King of romance Srk....
No ones does romance better then bollywood 😍❤
Yeh jawaani hai deewani is my all time favorite movie
Netflix 🤩❤
Ranbir Deepika Yjhd,Tamasha🥰🥰
Brought in the big gun at the end
Srk
Count in, Malaal. Worth watching ❤️
Seeing the Masaan scene reminded me of the ring😭
i love SRK 😍
Last one&#39;s truly heart touching!!!!
I wish there was Yeh jawaani hai deewani in Germany
TAMASHA one is amazing, Imtiaz Ali is just superb
Jab we met has a different fanbase.
Imran ko bhul gye apa
Yjhd😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Srk Was Enough to feature for this ... <br>You dun need X Y Z Stars
I’m getting goosebumps 🥺❤️
In most of Bollywood movies, Romance means harrassing and stalking girls until she says yes.
Omg😭❤❤❤
HOW CAN YOU GIVE A ROMANTIC VIDEO AND NOT ADD SRKAJOL?😶
When you have watched all these movies but can&#39;t say no to OM SHANTI OM ❤
Yar kuch tu soch lete hum singlee ke barey mein
The bollywood actors and actresses shown in this video no one, married each other😂😂
If only real life mein koi aise pyaar karta :&quot;)
Talking about Romance without Veer Zaara is a crime:/
Last one from Barfi..just lv it❤️
Singles k jale pe namak chhidhakte raho 🤣🤣😜
Bollywoods most romantic moment : Byah ho gaya kya, koi chua nahi kya 😂 (GOW1)
