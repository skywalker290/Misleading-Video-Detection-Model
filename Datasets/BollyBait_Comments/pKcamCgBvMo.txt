مادري بهاذ فلمكم شتريدون توصلون الناس انو زواج او الحب من نفس جنس شي عادي لا طبعا غلط <br>يعني لو تحول هاذ عالم كلو انو كل واحد يحب من نفس جنس مستحيل تكدرون تحولون الى صح عالم غبي عالم تفهه الحمدلله على نعمه السلام يه مفسدين لارض
It&#39;s sad to see tht this LGBTrash fever is hitting India too, moreover they making her a muslim girl🧕 , we Muslims we know wht is haram will remain haram forever.
Beautiful movie ❤
Against natures law 🎎
Bakwas
There is a reason why this movie was flop
अनिल कपूर, मधुमालती कपूर, बृजेंद्र कला, रेजिना कैसेंड्रा, अभिषेक दुहान, अल्का कौशल, सीमा पाहवा, सारा अर्जुन, राजकुमार राव की एक्टिंग मनोरंजन करती है। <br>पूरी सपोर्टिंग कास्ट, सीन, नगर 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻<br>आर्ट डिपार्टमेंट ने जो डायरी का प्रयोग किया है, वो लाजवाब है।👩‍🎓🌄
Im not even gay but this I can’t express how i felt watching this movie. Never cried so much. Hats off to the director for making such movie let alone a <b>bollywood</b> movie!
Pari Rekha. 😲🤩😍😍Wows. R. R. ❤❤
When i was watched the promotion of the movie i thought it the usual movie but when i saw the trailer then i realise that this is the best movie, but unfortunately some indian cant understand this
Bakwaas boring bekar time West 👀

Everyone is crying in the comment section
As an Indian bi woman who is in love with another woman. This movie made me feel really really seen and the whole last part where her dad stands for her just had me crying so hard. Because I’m the kinda child whose whole life is her dad and loves him more than anything in the world and just thinking about how if I told him who I love he might not accept me just is so sad. And her dad accepting her really did make me feel like there is hope for me. Honestly a great movie.
I watched this film with no expectations. I have always been finicky about films. But I am telling ya&#39;ll  , after watching this I didn&#39;t regret it. This movie was sooo good. As someone who was very young and didn&#39;t have any knowledge towards this community but was still very open minded , I was willing to learn. I had no idea it was LGBTQ film , but when I got to know, I was smiling the whole time.
A pure love story that made us all cry. Thank you from lebanon🌠
its trash🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
True love bhi nasib walon ko milta h kuch log love ko ek timepass ka khel smjhte h or khel khtm hote hi emotions ki parwah kiye bina move on kr jate h nye ki talash me. Yrr pyar sirf pyar hota h koi khel nhi ya koi soda nhi ki soch smjh kr kiya jaye. This movie inspired me that I can admit that who m i . I m special from others. I hv feelings for girls....
Darshan&#39;s voice is sooo adorable 🙌🙌💙💙
This is not fair apne love marriage kiya or movie me arrange marriage kiya bhot Galt kiya
I cry for the guy
I love the fact that they straight-baited all the bigots. A phenomenal movie, with an even more phenomenal cast!!
Bollywood india ki roots ko khatam karna chahta ha lakin aisa nahi ho ga. Sb ky samny ha ky ajj Bollywood khatam hony ko hai lakin india aur us ki roots apni jaga pr hain. Dushman thora sa india main hindu muslim issue bna kr kych museebat to bana paya ha lakin bohat juldi yeh issue bhi khatam ho jay ga. Same sex ya apny logon sy nafrat ka plan kabhi kamyab nahi ho saqta. Humanity main same sex aik beemari ha iss ko accept karo lakin aik bermari ky tor pr not as need for human.
Why the fucking fuck was I not aware about this film being lgbtqia+ 😭😭😭😭
Wher i can see the movie
Amazing acting amazing story ❤️❤️
I am myself is a straight but I really recommend to watch this movie, it can be anyone in your family who are going through so much pain just because they are different from you. Everyone wants to be get accepted for who they are and if you can&#39;t accept them at least don&#39;t make fun of them. I felt the loneliness he or she has to go for being different. Loneliness is not when you are alone in the crowd, loneliness is something where your loved ones don&#39;t accept for who you are
Unexpected story😱😱
Cried watching the trailer, SOBBED in the theater seat, and still got goosebumps and tears in my eyes thinking about now years later. The impact this film had on my life, personally, is impossible to overstate
Hate this movie 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩

This film wasn&#39;t appreciated? Hadd hai yaar, amongst Bollywood&#39;s attempts at representing LGBT+ love stories, this one looked the most promising....
Does this movie have a happy ending for the gl couple?
Hero tu acha letey
Anyone after badhai do trailer?
Truely Underrated movie 🙌🏼
Sonam kapoor rocked the role 👏
This movie really changed my point of view on lesbians. Now, I really support them.
I&#39;m a Bangladeshi girl and I&#39;m Pansexual. Sometimes I feel like I have to hide myself all my Life and to be honest I know I have to. But even if I have to sacrifice my happiness the only thing I&#39;ll ever wish for is, This society to be a little bit more friendly with us. It&#39;s who we are and we can&#39;t help it the only thing we can do is to hide ourselves until we die!🙂💔
Mujhe ye movie ka link dedona🥺
I believe someday my love will too fall in love with me 🥺🥺
GL?!! OMGGGG
Ho, ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga<br>Ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga<br>Jaise khilta gulaab, jaise shayar ka khwaab<br>Jaise ujali kiran, jaise ban mein hiran<br>Jaise chandni raat, jaise narmi baat<br>Jaise mandir mein ho ek jalta diya<br>Ho, ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga<br><br>[Verse 2]<br>Ho, ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga<br>Ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga<br>Jaise subah ka roop, jaise sardi ki dhoop<br>Jaise veena ki taan, jaise rangon ki jaan<br>Jaise balkhaayen bel, jaise lehron ka khel<br>Jaise khushboo liye aaye thandi hawa<br>Ho, ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga<br><br>[Verse 3]<br>Ho, ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga<br>Ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga<br>Jaise naachta moar, jaise resham ki dor<br>Jaise pariyon ka raag, jaise sandal ki aag<br>Jaise solah shringar, jaise ras ki phuhaar<br>Jaise aahista aahista badhta nasha<br>Ho, ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga
Super movie
My goodness<br>A very good story with great casting but unfortunately the lead actress looked very uncomfortable in the character of the lesbian.<br>Why do the character you don&#39;t believe in? Pathetic actress<br>The other actress very amazing.
Even if the movie isn’t perfect and some things could have been improved on, I still truly appreciate the initiative and I thank the people who made the decision to make a movie on this subject matter in an era when it’s much required. As a bisexual girl I cried watching the movie and I thought of my girlfriend. I am grateful that I didn’t have as many struggles with my sexuality and my parents also don’t have a problem with that, I mean I’m thankful I didn’t have obstacles and that I found mutual love being queer. I’m lucky that my girlfriend came in my life. All that said, I understand that it’s not the same with every queer person and most of us have to struggle all life to catch a breath and be our true selves. I feel deeply sorry for such people and I hope you are freed from your suffering and that you find happiness and peace.
Please! Don&#39;t go against nature <br>Just becoz you are superior than other animals
Ya movie  you tube par nahi hai  kya kidar milegi plz। Reply
Movie was okay, story achi thi lakin sahi tarha explain nahi kia joh karna chahye tha.
Ghatiya movie. They are spreading vulgarity by making such type of movies and destroying the family system by manipulating the minds of youngsters.
We need more of lgbtq awareness in bollywood and indian cinemas🏳️‍🌈
Seriously this is one of the best Bollywood works
Love this movie
It was decent movie. Thank God for that, family can watch together.
Best movie so far 😭😭😭
Loved every bit for it ✨✨
Watching this 2 yrs later and i still feel the same goosebumps and quivering excitement i felt when I watched it for the first time...
The two girls had zero chemistry, good story but not believable becsuse of bad acting
Saluto to tongue 👅 and finger👆
SPOILER ⚠️<br>While I watched the movie, I wished real people could change their conservative minds too the way they did in the movie through the way of that play, because I knew that real people will still remain the same even after watching the movie. And I was right because I can still see some homophobic comments here.
India deserve more movies like this ❤️
I Don&#39;t like LGBTQ people
Its weird how everyone is suddenly bisexual or lesbian in the comment section
The concept could have been presented more appropriately if &quot;Ek ladki ko dekha toh aisa laga&quot; was sung by a female singer.
Indian movie bkwassss nowadays.. Pyar mohabat relation pyar mohabat relation... Reality, emotional, Drama, war everything u will find in Hollywood movies.. Hindi movies useless only love story.. Sikho bollywood hollywood seh...
I&#39;m in love with this trailer. I&#39;m gonna watch this movie soon.<br><br><br>Happy pride🌈🌈
i cannot help it if i as a woman have feelings towards women, and i relate to sweety so much, what she went through growing up. i felt all of that
0: 45 plz tell me full song lyrics
Satyamev jayate story lines and u made it amir khan that&#39;s why i m biggest fan of urs....
সমকামিতা প্রোমোটিং
Parents should support LGBT
Its true, right? If true love doesn&#39;t have a happy ending, then its not true love. I really don&#39;t understand why families and people say I&#39;m not proud you when they come out!! Hello...we didn&#39;t destroy up the Maglyan or something. We just told you about our sexuality!! That&#39;s it. And If you can&#39;t accept it, then we&#39;re also not proud of you. Bcoz you&#39;re denying someone to love.
Please full movies daliye
We want more bollywood films about LBGTQ+ community 🥺
the title track by darshan raval is awesome a....
I think This is the only one LGBTQ movie which can be watched with your family without a little bit discomfort... it&#39;s So light... So cool...
Lesbian 😯👍
its 29th may 2021<br>i am so happy that <br>everyone is coming here to post their perspective after watching the movie ..... <br>and talking about this superb masterpiece ... <br>i am so late to watch this <br>but i can say ... <br>its a great movie... i love sonam&#39;s and rajkumar&#39;s acting in the movie ... <br>have fun ...and stay safe guys... ❇️
You tub dikh nhi rehi ek ladki ko dekha to esa lga movie
I&#39;m a gay guy from Bangalore. So, I had to watch this. I remember people in theatre laughing, trolling and bad mouthing when the lesbian scenes came. I was disgusted with people&#39;s instant reaction. People&#39;s mentality still living in 1900&#39;s.
Subh mangal zyada sandhan and ek ladki ko dekha toh aisa laga..... Two gems of Bollywood industry ❤
Huge respect for Sonam, for doing such a bold film role!
Bollywood we want more movies like this ❤️
We want more scenes of kuhu and sweety ❤️🥺
People can be lesbians but people can be gay I don&#39;t understand. Yak
Super sunm Kapoor with you Kapil Sharma you hahakhuss ❤️🔥👏 you
I can&#39;t believe its already been 2 years....favorite movie of all time yaar
Yeh to ek dum saf sutra gandu giri   hai bhai
They Straight-Baited the shit out of this movie. And I love them for that. So many people watched this anticipating a Guy-Girl love story who would have never watched this beautiful story if they knew the truth. I kinda hate the people for that reason. But this is clearly a start towards a better future. A better society.
Worse movie in Bollywood. dint expect that Rajkumar would role this kind of movie
Movie was good but the message of movie was ridiculous
❤❤❤❤one of my favs from 2019
Anybody here after Chakra movie
I loveeeee these songs in here but does she end up with a girl ??
Sonam is a kind of other World girl who proves that with her film choices ❤️. Perhaps her acting skill is not so very well but she always trying to her best &amp; she has also many types of talents like she has huge knowledge of fashion industry , clothing, politics etc. Overall her personality, body language, mentality is more appreciable than her acting but she has a big courage which not another talented actresses has . After governments in each country  Celebrities has the major power to change the world by  through showing theirs films. Like Hollywood industry is did they make a different kind of movies &amp; Netflix webseries in every topics. which make peoples understood the difference between right &amp; wrong &amp; the facts.🙏
Buht ghatiya movie thi jahil log
this made me cry
Mujhe muvi chahiye  please
Juhiiii &lt;3 love!
I cried so so much watching this film. As an indian lesbian, it felt very, very hard. And, at times you don&#39;t believe you can have a happy ending, let alone love.  I am so so grateful to the director for making this film, and everyone who contributed to it. I wish I could like it a million times. I am very emotional. Just thank you.
Congratulations for 2 years of Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga
Thank God this movie tanked. We still have some hope in humanity
Nice ☺😇☺🙂
Love is love. If we leave out the gender we get a broader viewpoint. <br>If u feel comfortable and happy with that person then be with that person. Why let other people&#39;s judgement in ur way<br>Your parents taught you what&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad but ur love life is for u to control they can&#39;t decide who you should love. You can love whoever you want don&#39;t let other people stop u from loving the person who gives u happiness ❤️
Katae chutiya movie dude<br>Mera fav actor hai rajkumar but yh movie katae chutiya lgi ksm se
Noone is talking About Rajkummar Rao 🥺
Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga
Still get goosebumps watching this
Love has no gender,if you are happy &amp; comfortable with the person that&#39;s only matter. Love is Love. Thank you bollywood &amp;Ek ladki Ko dekha to Aisa Laga team for making this.its beautiful 😚😚😚😚🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈<br>Everyone&#39;s have the right to be love.<br>In my opinion don&#39;t look the genders just consider that you are happy &amp; comfortable with your person.
Never ever thought that this movie would come out as a lesbian romance 👀
Best movie ,,,,,,,feel proud from lgbt community
So much straight baiting is required for the general indian audience to watch a movie of lgbtq+ representation...as much as I am grateful, this makes me think, will I never be accepted??
Anil Kapoor ok Buddha dikhane ki koshish ki phir bhi Woh young hi lag Raha he
Filme maravilhoso ❤️❤️❤️
Her dialogs &amp; expressions gives me no feelings what so ever..
Ce genre de film qui légitime l&#39;homosexualité ou le lesbianisme est une incitation à la dépravation et aux pratiques contre nature.
This movie deserve to be watched it&#39;s shows that we are totally wrong about love love it&#39;s not about your gender it&#39;s about your heart not just because you&#39;re a boy you should mary a girl or the opposite it&#39;s about for who you are falling
yuck
Ful video kh pa h
The only film of Sonam I love
Wow Sonam she is queen 😍😍😍
cant find this movie anywhere
Good start bollywood 👍
Yar you tub per yeh full movie download krdain plz
This movie trailer made me emotional <br>I cried because I wasted my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKcamCgBvMo&amp;t=155">2:35</a> minutes of my life watching this stupid trailer
When darshan ravel voice come
Full movie kaho nahi han
I am not crying you are! 😭❤️❤️❤️
I want to see this movie someone plzz help to watch this movie
Here only for Regina Cassandra ♥️
Nice movie
Please someone should answer me where I&#39;m i going to find the full movie?
Just watched on Netflix. Absolutely. Beautiful. It may not be getting the accolades it deserves because the &quot;straight baiting&quot; is strong. I knew prior to watching the, about the gay storyline, but anyone else may assume it&#39;s just a &quot;typical&quot; romance movie. All of the characters made it one of the best LGBT movies I have seen in a long time.
Why haven&#39;t I seen this film earlier???? Groundbreaking &lt;3
Boycott Kapoor&#39;s
Boycott nepotism
This movie literally describes me Im a lesbian in the closet and also Indian and my parents r homophobic! UGHHHH!!! Any advice??
I love you anil kapoor my life
I just saw this movie, sad reality and a wake up call. Hope this message gives us all education about lgbtq, this is not an illness for god&#39;s sake! Its a feeling, its inside of us. NOTHING and definitely NO ONE can ever change what we feel and how we feel.. so parents, stop forcing your children to do something against their will and definitely enough with this fvcking arrange-marriage! You are destroying your children&#39;s happiness! Neither your religion or god can change the &quot;natural&quot; feeling. <br>Dont be selfish uneducated parents! Wake up!!
i initially had no idea when i started watching this movie that what was gonna happen<br>but by the time as it unfolded its theme <br>man............i was literally blown away by the plot<br>it tried to make awareness abt what is required right now in india<br>( that&#39;s the race three got popular and not this)<br>rajkumar&#39;s acting on the spot as always<br>can&#39;t say abt sonum but tried her best <br>others did well too<br>this was kind of a revolutionary movie i should say<br>and 1000000x   better than race 3.<br>that&#39;s it go and watch it.<br>amazing movie
This movie contains rare concept...but it goes fail bcz of Sonam&#39;s being nepotism ptoduct...and the whole film trailer dowsnt even show the another girl from tamil I.think...
Watched on Netflix for raj Kumar rao. Enjoyed watching Regina, juhi n anil kapoor too. Message n loneliness made me cry coz its true
Sonam kapoor what she is doing acting or over acting . Her acting is just like💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Lak de lanat kanjero
i hate bollywood ghatya gande log hain transgender Khusre bhi inse behter hai
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
She is very bad looking girl
Who is she her acting is very bad
Sonam is such a bad actress when she cry on the screen it feels like she smelled someone shiting 🤣🤣
i cried for the complete last 30 minutes. i love this movie.
muito show esse filme
Hum jins persati dekhae gae ha is movie me gadiya tareen movie Sonam ko kahe ke bhr ja ker her ek ke sath kiya Kare bakio ko na btae
Yar itni gandi film Jo brain wash Kare ge ye family ko khrb Kare ge
Movie full bhejo
Stupid and disgusting movie of the year
Kab relas kar rahe hoo Plizz 🙏 relas kar dona 👍👍👍
Hamare society family ko aise hi movie ki need hai thora to thought improve hogi
Thats Bollywood for you they focused more on daughter father instead of proper love. This is nothing compared to call me by your name but beware the after affects of that movie is so intense it may take weeks to rectify.
behoda yr logon ko samajh nai a rahi k woh kiya gand phela rahe hein or oper se in tareef kar rahein hein gandhe log
I want a Indian girl 😭😭😭💔
😭😭❤️❤️❤️
yes a religious muslim guy is explaining a punjabi lesbian girl that giving up on her sexuality to satisfy her family is bullshit and she should never give up on her happiness? wow
I cry every time I watch this film - so beautiful and exactly what I went through (sans being accepted at the end).
Just Love it....this movie is sooooo related.☺️<br>Wish everyone very well
I just saw the movie and it&#39;s great, i cried because it&#39;s very relateble to me. I&#39;m so glad such film finally gets to Bollywood. great cast too, Sonam Kapoor did a great job.
Only those people can feel this pain who go through it. 😔😢😒
Movie bahoot hi khoobsurat thi...❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<br>Ek ladki ko dekha toh assa laga 👌👌👌<br>Shubh mangal jyada savdhan 👎👎👎👎

लडक़ी को लड़की से प्यार होता है, मूवी थोड़ी अलग सी लगे गी, पर ये उन परिवार वालों के लिये है, जिनके बच्चे ऐसे होते है यानी लड़के को लड़की नही लड़का ही अच्छा लगता है या लड़की को लड़का नही लड़की ही अच्छी लगती है। पता नही ये कोई बीमारी है या कुछ और मैं नही जानता,पर इतना तो इस मूवी से सीख लिया है कि प्यार से बड़ा कुछ नही होता। बाकी आप मूवी देख लेना।
lesbian of indian descent here! this looks like a masterpiece, and i&#39;m still so sad that i can&#39;t watch it. (also apparently these are the people who made 3 idiots so i know this film is gonna slap)
🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
this and shubh mangal zyada saavdhan are the holy duo of gay bollywood🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
I love how hey straight baited everyone
the heterobait I love it
I had no idea that this was about Lesbian couple. Why nobody talked about it!!!?? 😭
I am as different from you as you are from me...<br>And that places us at the same starting point...<br>So we shall ride together, <br>Through this beautiful journey of life, <br>With compassion, understanding, acceptance, <br>And most importantly, <br>Love.<br>❤❤❤<br><b><i>Live &amp; let live.</i></b><br>Greetings from Sri Lanka.
Thank you so much for making this movie. Came out to my parents after watching it.

Where to watch this?
A beautiful movie. So relatable!
I am a lesbian girl from India and after watching this trailer I felt so so good that now bollywood has started directing such movies..and hatss of to sonam kapoor for playing such a incredible role.and the comments section is so positive . Those who have unliked this video we can&#39;t call them <a href="http://humans.so/">humans.so</a> love is Love and don&#39;t be afraid of who you are. Be you and be proud of yourself 😊❤
ये मादरचोद संस्कृति बारबाद करने पर तुले हैं
This is an illnesses and the western culture is also going through bad phase bcz of all these wrong type of love and be sure not to get excited by all these or else your natural process of making love will get wasted
Okay I did not see that coming, and I must say it was a very pleasant surprise. Even bigger surprise was the comment section, India has truly come a long way.<br>Glad to see the wave of change in Bollywood ^_^

As I&#39;m a gay man from Pakistan belongs to typical Punjabi family  ...I had suffered almost the same childhood as shown in this movie ....No one here to understand you .. you have to live in just your own made world ...now going to finish my teenage hoping a best future as a gay man Pakistan ....Nice efforts by great Sonam Kapoor she is really supporting LGBT community she was one of the earliest actress who gave statement when indian government legalized homosexuality.
I was bated in to watching this disgusting movie on Netflix. Imagine the same exact movie but instead of a girl its a pedophile trapped inside a glass cube wanting someone to release him lol pathetic
The only movie which made me cry. Thank you Sonam and Anil Kapoor. Lots, lots and lots of love from Pakistan.<br>(LOVE can never be wrong).
lanat asi movie par
I literally can&#39;t find any negative comment.<br>PROUD 🌈
Who is the other lead actress????
Bht e fazool theme tha is movie ka
I want movies like this. But what to do, max. Indian audience will not accept this. India likes Rohit Shetty films, Soo saddd
I salute Sonam Kapoor for selecting this role. She may not be so talented like kangana or tapsee but she has lot of guts, one of the most versatile acctress in Bollywood. Those who agree hit like
Kitny cheap mentality me indulge hn ye ghtyaa log ghinn aati ay
Damn this movie was excellent. Better than what I expected.
Finally people need to understand love is love don&#39;t judge..😍
This movie 🍿 all time favourite
I didn&#39;t hate it. But It&#39;s little bit wired you know!! I think it&#39;s just because I am not feeling like this persons. But kisi Ko agar aysa pyaar hota hai toh thik hai.. Koi nehi kar lene do ☺️☺️

Watch the trailer to the most awaited movie of the year - Mission Mangal - starring Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan, Sonakshi Sinha and Taapsee Pannu, directed by Jagan Shakti : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q10nfS9V090">https://youtu.be/q10nfS9V090</a>
I didn&#39;t see the movie, but from the comments I realized that&#39;s it about lesbian girl ... That&#39;s ugly really  please don&#39;t be a part  to support these community that&#39;s not nrml they are not nrml the should  realized that&#39;s not acceptable to get out of the nature ..... I ask God to show them the right way.. it&#39;s really sad to see  Young girls or boys  with career doing wrong things.. ask for help .. fight take traitement please Don&#39;t be gays
I watched the movie yesterday and it was really nice ❤💯👌🔥<br>I really appreciated the fact that sahil aka rajkumar supported Sonam after knowing the truth about her sexuality 💕<br>I started crying when Sonam came out to her family and explaining stuff like she was gonna compromise her life by staying alone , nobody understood her &amp; so on 😭😢 <br>I&#39;m hoping to see more LGBTQ+ movies in Bollywood 💚👍
I think this is the only way to control India papulation .<br>They will advertis  more and more
Ye movie kab ayegi you tup par

Boat Galt topic pe film hai
Being a lesbian and loving another girl doesn&#39;t make your love any lesser, love is love , all people have the right to decide who they want to spend their life with , I love this movie it brought tears in my eyes.True Love , I am so happy they finally have a lesbian themed movie in Bollywood.
Ek ladki ko dekha toh aisa Laga is very very very very very nice movie...I really loved it! 😘😘
I am a lesbian woman from the United States. I loved this film!! I&#39;ve always wanted to visit India. I hope that one day I can. There&#39;s so much beauty in the world, we just have to open our eyes to see it! ❤️🏳️‍🌈
How can I watch this movie
Nauzbillah,,This film industry got damn fools,, they totally wants to bring Western culture in india too,, its not a natural thing its a virus which we need take strict actions towards it,, firstly this industry brought nudity in india by shorting clothes giving the names as modernism, and now they want to bring such stupidity in indian society, 80% they ruined the life of adults by giving false msg and now they want to raise the percentage of bisexuals.. Any how on last they want wild life as animals as they r forgeting or loosing the humanity!
Being a gay...I hope so....it could change the mindset of our people
Where can I watch this movie??
It&#39;s been four months since this movie came out and I still get goosebumps watching this trailer.  Easily my favorite movie of all time.
This illuminati promoting
the gay propaganda is taking over bollywood and this is what you get when trying to be hollywood
Lanat beshumar ha is movie pay or bnany walo pay.. koi band krwao asi chezo ko ya kia ho rha ha ghatya movies hain ya sb

lesbian love? Ok something new in Bollywood
Love this video from pakistan i wish pakistani cinema would make movie like this
Watched the movies. Made me heart stop for a second. Such a good movie for people who are hustling. Must watch! And good acting also
Really beautiful movie.
Y anywhere Regina&#39;s name was not mentioned???
I am a lesbian, I am watching this movie right now, it makes me so happy for India to be doing a movie like this. Congratulations to all the lgbt Indians out there this is great.
benchooo -  lanat hu is movie k writter pe Ese movie koi bnata h kya 😡 is movie ko daikhne k bad tum pr sirf lanat bhejne k liye aya hu comment krne k Bsdk 😡😡 Sasty indian awam 😡
Penyakit dan harus disembuhkan... Akan datang kehancuran jika dilegalkan oh my bolywood knp 😥😥😥
Pure movie kaha dak saktay han
Itne Dino baad koi saaf suthri comment box dekha !👍😂
One of the best Indian movies
I am a bisexual girl from germany. I don&#39;t know much about indian movies but I heard about this one and it looks beautiful. I think it is very important that girls like me all around the world should be able to see a story like this. They should be able to see that should they fall in love with a girl that does not make their love any lesser just because it is less common. Thank you to everyone involved in the making of this movie. I might not know this culture very well but I know what that young woman is feeling. And seeing her love being shown as love is more important than I know how to express.
Want more movies like this
The film is mindblowing it&#39;s worth watching...but its saddening that hypocrites Indian people have not watched it yet .
Mind-shattering Movie Loved it❤️♥️♥️
I cried a few times, the way she describes her loneliness, not fitting in ever, not having any true friend and praying that she could wake up &#39;normal&#39;...is so relatable.
Eye opener we must become open accept all kind of human in our society <br>All of them done good acting’s well made movie
This was such a beautiful concept!! I deeply admire the director and the cast! PLEASE MAKE MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS!!
The concept of the movie is very good. Everyone has a fight to live a normal life.  If anyone is born LGBTQ, then it&#39;s not at all his fault.
Fucking Bollywood with this movie stop ruining my kids future.. ..because many of these kids are not gay but because of your movies they will think they are....Anil Kapoor has ruined bunch of our kids
I cried so much watching this movie because for the very first time, I truly saw myself represented in a woman of a Bollywood film. A huge round of applause to Sonam K Ahuja for taking this role and doing it justice and to VVC and Shelly Chopra Dhar for bringing this film to mainstream audiences. I am not out yet to my parents but I believe showing them this film will help me in that process. Art and film can truly help change mindsets &lt;3
Is se bakwazzz &amp; is se kharab movie main ne aj tak nehi dekha...
I strongly recommend this movie to you guys honestly it’s such a beautiful movie watched it a month ago on Netflix I seriously don’t regret watching this movie... Such a pure touching story a movie that will make you laugh and cry at once. Was never a fan of Sonam Kapoor but after watching this movie I tripped over my feet for her &amp; Regina Cassandra but only for an actress. Not everyone is that lucky especially when it comes to religions and cultures...😔 But anyway it a beautiful movie and a very beautiful song aswell much love from South Africa 🇿🇦 💪🥰🙂
Ek gay movie Dekha To Aisa Laga
Hiii
Bkwas movie
Ge Vali movie
Just saw the movie......it will surely gonna make an impact and change people&#39;s perspective towards their society to some extent......but one thing I wanna say is that the main theme on which the movie is based was showcased only in last half an hour..... It would be different if the makers think out of this typical Bollywood way and concentrating more the main issue..... ..
Best movie  and logo ki soch to badle gi iss movie se bestsss movie
People hate what they don’t understand
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKcamCgBvMo&amp;t=143">2:23</a>
Who came here after watching the world television premium...
Totally nonsense ..
Great movie
This is the most Bullshit movie I&#39;ve ever watched. <br>This movie practices homosexual.<br>I don&#39;t understand what made Anil Kapoor sign this movie
Bless these people who made this movie. I&#39;m gay and everything I&#39;m going through is exactly portrayed in the movie. Thank you so much for making a movie like this. I wish my parents will one day accept me. This movie just made me cry. A must watch.
Beshumar lanat lantieo eise filmo pe or tum logo pe
Nice trailer
just saw the movie<br>this will really help the orthodox society to think differently<br>hatts off VVC.....after 3 idiots one more gem
shame on her for doing movie like this
Disgusting movie god please save all of us
She is a Lesbian<br><br>Oh right....forgot to say <b>&quot;SPOILERS!&quot;</b>
this movie is so so important, i cried so much. the story is so well made and so relatable;; please please watch it
bloody hell<br>nature k khilaf koi bhi cheez acchi nhi hoti<br>r in cheezo ko samjh ke koi brd minded nhi hota samaj ka 1 nizam hota h aise hi sab ko pyar hone lage na to ye duniya to gyi
Kon SE movie h

Exceptionally well potrayed movie...Love. Is whf matters.  Sonam super
Mast <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sparkcreativesolutions">#SparkCreativeSolutions</a>
when I saw trailer for first time, I thought it&#39;s regarding Sonam&#39;s career.. and was pleasantly surprised to see the movie and discover the truth.. :) &lt;3
https://youtu.be/DdgbcqDr2PE ek ladki to dekha to aisha laga song
Kyu ki pankaj udas hogaya hai😂😂
Ladies and gentlemen this is India.....mashriq ke naam pe dhabba
Stupid movie. We are directly indirectly promoting such wrong relationships in society. These promotions are destroying the roots of morals of our upcoming and current generations. Aneel Kapoor, i am big fan of yours but please do not be part of such acts in future. Agr oper waly ny is rishty ko sahi karar dia hota tau aurat mard ka concept he na hota. This gora chamrri still wants to destroy us morally.
Ye movie kisi ne dekhi hai Tw btao plz Kesi movie hai ye
WE NEED A SEqUEL ASAP!!!!!
Feel sorry for her lack of political  understanding...unfollowed...if that was normal then how does the puzzle fits...only man and woman fits...  they are just trying to fabricate the idea and making it normal ...i am sad the tools fr it are @anilskapoor family..👎
I have just watched the movie. The story is weak, the writing is dull. Rajkumar has done a decent job. Anil and Juhi has a funny and good chemistry. The movie is below average. The second half of movie drags the movie down. Sonam Kapoors so called acting is two demontionel. She has a happy and sad face, the girl cant act.
AMAZINGGGGG MOVIEEEE!!!!!!! LOVE IS LOVE NO MATTER WHICH GENDER!!! PEOPLE MUST ACCEPT THE FACT THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A NEW WORLD......
Amazing movie <br>Loved it ❤️❤️❤️
happy to see a mainstream cinema on lgbt community.. hope to see some more serious films like this on lgbt subject
Lesbians film 🤣🤣🤣
It is a psychological disease and is against the power this is a total useless movie from pakistan
Amazing movie which means a lot to many people &lt;3
Never in my life I thought I’d see a Indian/Punjabi LGBT movie as a Punjabi bisexual I am very proud of this movie and myself
Bohot khoobsurat movie hai...lekin a66a to tab lagega jab god k banaye sabhi insano ko ek hi nazar se dekha jayega...aise insano ko jab humari society accept karegi bina koi bhedbhaw k tab jake sahi maino mein insaniyat kayam hogi....
What? 🙈🙈🙈
Please upload the movie...
Topनाइस फिल्म अच्छी है 🌹
Mar jau bhai Mar Mar Mar............
Happy this shit flopped. Aisi beemariyo ko panapna bhi nahi chahiye.
A movie that everyone will remember. And this movie can rock in the whole world. And this comment is after wathing the movie. Songs are all awesome.
As a bisexual 13 year old muslim......this movie was the best....it meant alot..that someone of indian faith made this movie....i saw it at home with my mom and dad ....my dad was so disgusted .....i wanted to give him a lecture about LGBTQ+ .....but he would have the idea that im bi....no one knows im bi ...but my older brothers know and they supporting me  ......being gay is not a disease nor an illness....so plz if u have un pleasant remarks leave them else where....💖
I worry for future and there is nothing sad about this situation of being lesbian.
Poison, for young people killing every beautiful relation between friends sisters brothers parents &amp; trying to celebrate wrong message in the name of love.. making fun of human relation Indian Cinema now helping to bring one to one concept &amp; telling people parents are old enough they don&#39;t understand life let them do whatever they do don&#39;t disturb them wow great lines!!... we really need education to understand what actually LOVE is...&amp; why we need! you need more search to highlight this issue &amp; its causes... moo utha ker movie bana dete hen kuch bhi
Its always made me sad to see how most Bollywood movies use homosexuality as a joke, like its only okay if we are making fun of it. I am so proud to see an open movie that actually explores a different relationship in such a pure way. This movie is amazing, emotional and expresses how I have felt growing up. It&#39;s hard coming out to your family when they can&#39;t understand you and don&#39;t give you a chance to be who you are because of what others will think and feel.
and another love story, cmonnnnnnnn
This movie just promot sinner. Actually they are giving wrong massage to youngsters. <br>I realy not expect  that people wil appreciate to this movie.
Trailer dekh k koi bhi ni soch skta movie kya hogi, ase love me na lust hota h na dhokhe ka darrr
i saw this movie last night on netflix and it was beautifully made, well done! 🙌🏼
People are changing. Their mindset is heading towards the right direction. So happy to see this
Ya kayamat ka nisani hai
Acabei de assistir na netflix e ameeeei &lt;3
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nonsense movie
Check my channel for the movie...
It&#39;s now on Netflix US.
I juz saw this movie and it&#39;s obviously the most unexpected love story of the year and is amazing💕!!!!
iis movie main to indian media ne had hi kar di seedha seedha aj kal ki bachiyon ko lesbian ki tarbiyat de di .... lanat tumhare is idea pe or movie banane pe or daro Allah ke azab se akhir mar jana hai ek din islam kabool karo or pakiza life guzaro.... pehle movie banti thin muashre ke related ab to muashre se hi hat gaye ho tum sab log ek dafa phir se lanat be shumar hindu logo
l lakh di lanat tum sab insha Allah,,, Allah ke Qehar se nahi bacho gy hindu sirf duniya main gandagi phela rahe hain.... sab ko pata hai ham jins parasti kitni buri cheez hai... or Mere Allah pak ko bhi ye sakhti se na pasand hai... tum log ho to insan hi kyun fitrat se hat ke logon ko aisi movies ke through concept de rahe ho keh tum jese chaho wese kar sakte ho.... tum logon ki movies ki waja se hi muashre main shaitani zeyada pheli hai kyun keh tumhare zehan na pak hai.... khabeeso
I liked the movie its emotional <br>Specially Anil Kapoor did great work.
India Gandu hoo gya hai
This movie is worth your time
MADAR CHOOD yeh bhi kiya movie hai ghaando log time waste karke rakh deya total chotiyapa tum harami log one of the worse movies i have ever watched fcuking so mad
ek dum bullshit movie bloody waste my time . making more spoiled hell the society simply against the nature is leading to homosexulity which is not acceptable
Ghaleez hindu chahty hain ke muslims main bay heyai phely isliye hamesha apni movies main muslims ko badnaam karty hain. Lanat hai bollywood pay aur aisi movies dekhny walo par bhi lanat hai !!!!
nice movie, ye kpr apni jaat dikha rahe hai
So, Rajkumar Rao in yet another movie with LGBTQ theme.
Itni gndi movie or Sonam toh hr movie m bdi gndi lgti h
No comments
Hope this world will finally accept this beautiful relationship
This is going to be my first indian movie.
As first there many mixed reviews about this movie which was giving me mixed emotions about this movie. But after watching it, this movie is definitely representing LBGTQ in right direction. Even though it is subtle aspects of the movie, it does touch your heart! Great movie in my opinion.
lesbian Girl Friend 😂😂😅
i love Rajkumar rau acting
no gay niggas here
THIS MOVIE IS FINALLY ON NETFLIX ITS SO GOOD GUYS WATCH ITTTT 😭❤️🌈🌈🌈❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏👏
Is India Going to be homosexual? yes or no
By watching this trailer I guess Sonam is a lesbian
That&#39;s why ratings are so low. lol
Such a shame.
Now if only they put some representation on TV serials since that&#39;s what most people watch. Such an amazing time to be alive.
💙 Sonam Kapoor 💙
So basically Rajkumar Rao is Ross from friends here 🤔🤣🤣
Awsm concept can&#39;t wait to watch this movie.
I&#39;m seeking for a lesbian girl in Mumbai. Dm me on Instagram if interested . Trainwithprriya
very amazing story keep it up  🙌 people need to change if people can&#39;t don&#39;t talk about humanity also
These type of a movies sh0uld be encouraged 😊😊😊😊
I watched this film last month and thought it was very courageous and brave production ,and about time fore the LGBT community of India - but the film was a missed opportunity , badly directed and executed and I could&#39;nt get empathetic or connected with any of  the characters .Still ,it was a move forward.
Early lunch
😀
Super

Very very happy to see that bollywood is also developing day by day . Its a best topic a best issue . Wish that by seeing this movie the thinking society will expend..<br>And that it may helpful for all those people who have to face these problems..
Beautiful too look at, even if I don&#39;t speak any of the other languages, in India (other than English, of course).
Super cool
❤️💙💚💛💜💖
Raj KumarRao ko har bar ladki dhoka hi kyu deti hai😂<br><b>TUKRAKE MERA PYAAR TU MERA INTEKAM DEKHEGI</b> 😭
Sonam Kapoor ka Chakkar uske Hi Baap k Sath chal raha h.. Apne hi baap se chudvati h randi h sali...
Love the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lgbtq">#LGBTQ</a> they have also feelings, must watch   the film in MH&amp;UP
This trailer is so subtle with the story&#39;s plot/implications...are they worried about backlash? I was expecting her being a lesbian to play a more prominent part in the trailer.
https://youtu.be/1WiKLWPXPt0
India is progressing forward. 👍<br>Respecting from Bangladesh.
So many good reviews, so much support to the film, no hate comments.... Ok!!! bt i wonder why the film got flopped??? Can anyone explain?
I love it 😍 .I want to whatch this movie, but I’m living in Germany  :/ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23letlovebe">#Letlovebe</a> 🏳️‍🌈😍
very nice video    ........
I love the commemt section!!! So many positive comments! I am not homophobic at all instead i support LGBTQ+. I really like how people are changing their mindsets... too bad this movie isnt releasing in my country because theres lgbt content. Anyways love u sonam!!!!!
Finally the lgbtq community has a new ray of hope in INDIA. we should love the person not the gender.thank u sonam for the beautiful movie👌
Why the heck rajkumar did this movie, again aisha type movie

A lot of respect for Sonam Kapoor for playing such a role ❤👍👍👍
I become a big fan of Rajkumar Rao bcoz of his acting... He is unique...❤👍
This story reminds me of the movie Jenny&#39;s wedding starring Katherine heigl and Alexis bledel... anyone with me?
what the hell this movie is not a family movie.. do you know what we will answer to small kids watching movie with us...you should even tell the theme of movie... otherwise movie had deep meaning but uh should care its impact on small kid they will be misguided thinking it as a western fashion...
I just can say... Lanat hay tum par... Shame on you....
Question to people who watched this amazing heart touching movie:<br>What was the name of the emotional background tone when Rajkumar Rao was speaking with his reel mother on the terrace?
Sonam ji कितनी घटिया acting करती हो तुस्सी, आप से अच्छी acting तो इस टाइप के साइड रोल में juhi_chawla की थी.... 😵😵😵😵😵
Trash
Love is love😄

Even though I am a straight girl I still support the lgbt community, they deserve equal rights
Censor board ghas khata hai kya
THE WORLD HAS GONE BONKERS.
Wow I never thought such a movie would come out on Bollywood. I love this kind of cinema. So REAL.
I really hope India soon becomes more conservative and they comes to you homosexual because I cannot stand this.
Well its official India&#39;s fucked
Watched the movie I am so disapointed of all the elders and espcialy Anil Kapoor and ur daughter for promoting such disrepectful thing in the World <br><br>Fear ur God he did not create lesbians nor Gay people create these things themselves may God protect us and our kids.....u shameless people I am so pissed I wasted my money
Finally on the right track <br>thank you
I pray makers of ELKDTAL R Lynched!!!
Juhi does not look old enough to be sonams mum
I don&#39;t know to whom soman love

Ye Randi Khana barhta jaa Raha h in sabko goli maar Deni chahiye
I am indian and pansexual! Though pansexuality is one of the least known I am still impressed that the lesbian community is getting it&#39;s recognition. Maybe one lgbt will have a proper stand and voice in india. People will be more aware hopefully and not shut their ears to something they have not known of before and thus don&#39;t understand
how is this movie
she is playing a homosexual character right??
How is the ending of this movie?
Pagol

I feel so happy to finally see the LGBTQ representation on Bollywood screen, I hope this initiative proves to be a great success and paves way for further awareness.<br>Proud to be Indian.
Less likes than gully boy but still hope it will be an epic
Seeing movies like this one &amp; Kapoor And Sons breaking into mainstream media gives me so much hope for the future of LGBT+ people in desi countries. I can never come out to my parents, they will never accept me. But I hope movies like this open the eyes of other parents and make other kids’ coming out stories easier. 💛🌈

Sab gay ya lesbian par movie banaate hai lekin bio par koi nahi banata... Yah galat hai
What is rajkumar Rao&#39;s role if it is a lesbian love story?
Koi original gaana bhi h ki Ni?
go go goooo im crying i love dis
Stop calling God&#39;s name in this abomination
I am really overwhelmed and super excited on hearing that Bollywood has a whole different romance to share on screen with us. Girl love. Gosh they have done away with old age boy-girl thing. I hope it will help people umderstand the concept of lesbianism better. People will definitely talk about it openly which gives it a high way to go.
Bollywood Again Promoting Misconceptions &amp; Corruption into the society And as always People Swallowing sparkle wrapped shit like its new ice cream in the market.  <br>Wait till they soon start to promotes Pedophilia &amp; Necrophilia as Next Modern &amp; Romantic thing into the Society. Just Pathetic! <br>Save Your self &amp; your kids. <br>Dont Fall for these emotional melo drama. No one is gay or straight or bi from birth, it is a cultural thing that person&#39;s biology accepts as conditioned which (the sexual orientation) then respectively become natural to the person.<br>Support LBGT Community &amp; it&#39;s human rights but dont Support normalizing &amp; glorifying it. Once corruption is done it cant be undone.<br>Wake up ! Corruption of your kids is on its way. Stay Alert or live the consequence! Reject The Bollywood Garbage!
Rajkumar Rao kinda reminds me of Ross Geller 😂
I&#39;m ao happy to know that India is doing this kind of movie, because it will help a lot to make the society to understand and accept this.
I&#39;m Big fan of Raj Kumar rao
😢😢😢

Isse bhi Mann na maane to american series Dekho jisme girls-girls and boys-boys aapas m hi sex karte h. Waise hi sab log ban jaao.
Yeh koi Pehli film Nahi h about Lesbian aur Dostana bhi koi pehla film Nahi that about Gay. <br><br>Fire-1996, Bombay Boys-1998, Girlfriend-2004, I am-2011, Honeymoon Travels-2007, Fashion-2008, Bombay Talkies-2013 etc.
Title Hona chahiye-Ek Ladki ko dekhi to aisi lagi. <br><br>Stree-Purush, Aadmi-Aurat, Ladka-Ladki ka concept hi khatm Kar dala.
Ab se aise naam honge flats k baahar-<br><br>Mrs. ABC &amp; Mrs. DEF (Lesbian/Gay Married Couple)<br><br>Mr. ABC &amp; Mr. DEF (Gay/Lesbian Married Couple)<br><br>And believe me all of you, yeh San dikhava h. Ek video Aaya tha, jisme lesbian and gay couples Ka lifestyle dikhaya aur bataya gaya ki is lifestyle m koi speciality Nahi hai. <br><br>Isliye kabhi acche se sochna ki kahan par youth jaa raha jai aur jaayega.
In sab cheezon se normal ladke-ladkiya k dimaag par bhi asar parta h. Aane wali peedhi (generation) ko bolna -ek ladki ko Dekha to aisa laga &amp; KJO ka Dostana dikhana. Bollywood to paise/fame k liye desh ki purani Sanskritic ko khatm karta jaa Raha hai. Samajhne h to samjho.
Dhajjiya pe dhajjiya udti has rahi h. Aur ise LGBTQ rights Ka ma&#39;am diya has Raha h. Ab to aisa Lagta h ki opposite sex m Shaadi dikhava rahega aur Mohabbat Ka phool same sex m khilega.
Yeh aaj k date m log apne life m opposite gender se bore hote has rahe h iske liye same gender m sex/love develop karna chslu Kar Raha Hain. Bollywood women empowerment k naam par Veere Di wedding m nangaapan ka rights dikhata h. Ab lesbian/gay sex Ka rights dikhata h. Bollywood is ruining the entire country with these type of bogus movies.
I love anil kapoor
The girl sonam loves is in yellow dress at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKcamCgBvMo&amp;t=87">1:27</a>
This has to be directed or produced or some part played by karan johar..as he is the first one to introduce all this in bollywood

Nice
I am glad that movies are portraying LGBT love.
Looking at the comments, you get the feeling there are so many of the LGBT community living in hiding in the society you live, the city or village you live in. Makes me nervous. It is a scary world up ahead.
It is a mind shattering movie just loved it aamazing
Very nice movie..sensitive topic handle without making fun or puting sex scene
As a transgender I&#39;m so happy for such a film to come
About time Bollywood made a movie for our Gando girls. Well done!! Really inspiring for our future generations. Keep up the good in messing up there heads.
I hate this movie
In My whole like this is  very very bad bad bad movie
This movie dubbed Tamil pls
Nice bhai ye to Mera labh story hi
There is no such thing naturally created as homosexuality . It is altogether against natural laws not against society . An utterly stupid misconception . One may like a girlfriend or a boyfriend but it does not mean that the person is sexually attracted to that individual. Only a modern sickness going around. A disease without a cure unless it is considered a disease.
Sooo amazing....hope ki humare desh k logo ki soch badal jaye....
One of the pathetic movie of 2019
LGBTQ supporters<br>Like if you support!!!
So nice movie 👌👌
Ganduu
The Positivity in the comments is really just so refreshing  to see!<br>Glad to read the excitement and overall happiness ....☺<br>The Flim is very nice...I saw the movie tomorrow ....I think this movie is among the best movies on Bollywood. ..<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23setlovefree">#Setlovefree</a>❤
Movie dekh kr pesa or time dono West karna h , kuch bhi bana de rhe h
Supper
A good start for lgbt...hope they get their acceptance soon by society
Who wants to watched the full movie?
21M views yeah!
The time has been set to change the hetroenormative stories of the movie industry which postulates norms and sensibilities to a greater population, with such Stories. Hope all the regional movie industries have something to offer too to percolate acceptance and inclusion.
finally some good amount of diversity India.<br>They should  definitely make another movie like Call me by your name
O my freaking Goshhhhhh<br>Gotta watch this<br>May this movie go blockbuster hit....<br>🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
Mst
I moved to another country due to the same fear. Seeing this, where people of the LGBTQ community are not being ridiculed, instead a slice of their journey is shared, gives me some hope in the Bollywood industry which otherwise is fearfully homophobic.

This is the first time in watching the trailer and I got a hint of what the movie is but as the trailer ended I scrolled down to verify and it turned out what I expected<br>Edit:I have no problem with it though I&#39;m open abt every person the way they are😁
Unexpected movie one of the best movie of this yrs. 👍😃
It&#39;s sad that the trailer has achieved so much appreciation yet people don&#39;t go to the film.....the movie deserves a lot more love than it is recieving right now
totally worst movie
how is the picture
Hii
Sonam kapoor single handed ruined the movie. Felt bad for the rest of cast
This movie must be watched free of cost in Set Max......not a single penny more than this.
And... Here co s one more movie where Rajkummar didn&#39;t get married.😂😂😂 anyways great story😍 finally Indian cinema is changing positively😊
Loved the movie ...  Great story ... And a strong msg ... Loved Sonam and Anil sir 😍😍
Baby Sara has grown up

The level of virtue signaling is unbearable. The only reason gay marriage has been legalized in India is because the country has been practicing female infanticide for several decades which has led to almost a 300 million fewer women than men. Otherwise the government can&#39;t even stand pornography.
Nothing is relieving than to know people are getting aware to acknowledge the existence of same sex relation. When i came out to my parents last year, their first question was &quot;have you seen anyone like this&quot; which was right because there was never an Indian example to show them. But now I have. Even if they close their eyes or cover their eyes, bollywood plays a big role in Indian society. For the first time, the effort is marvelous. I hope next movies are more open, sensitive and redirect towards positive reality.<br>Thanks Gazal Dhaliwal for writing and Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Shelly Chopra Dhar for producing and directing!<br>Being a closeted lesbian, I felt like sweety for many years of my life so I can relate (yeah! Not the sacrifice and the compromise part! 😊)
Kia chutia concept hai movie ka.....<br>Illuminate vale is type ki movies bnva rhe hai ...india ko brbad kia ja rha ha.......na smjo ge to mit jao ge india valo........jis ko ni pata k illuminate kia ha net pr search kr lo...or hony sing k song makhna b sun lo us me b zikr ha is ka
Lesbo love💓 too bad
Itni Urdu to mujhay bhi nahee aati. <br><br><br>and I&#39;m from Pakistan. ❤️️
Feeling v sad for Indians. What happened to them now they will show positive reactions to such stories
I love you mahi very much mis you always
Good movie
At first I thought &quot;oh great! Another rom-com!&quot; But by the end of the trailer, I was impatient to see this. Oh my god, it&#39;s so good to see a story with a lead character being from the LGBT community.
🤐😵Jis human ka mind right direction me chalta ho wo homosexual ko support nahi karega....aap ko agar lagta hai ki homosexual cultur human world ke liye achha hai to....kyo nahi sab log is culture ko absorb karte, par nahi aisa nahi hota ,hai kyoki ek person fool hai to sab log fool nahi hote right 😒 LGBTQAI par movie ban gaya hai india me, hamare liye sharam ki baat ,hai wo bhi.... Anil kapoor aur sonam kapoor jase actor hai...🤔 Disgusting😠  Bollywood is going in wrong direction....🚫🚷🤼
What is the meaning of LGBTQ?
Live your life irrespective of perspective
LESBO flick- finally at thy service... Loving someone is not an issue, but who to love IS ? Well, this could be contributive in lessening the population of India, somehow... When can we expect to see gay guys from the mainstream cinema? Shah Rukh Khan and Salman&#39;s movie might be as rumors are in the air by BHANSALI&#39;s production house... Fingers crossed...
Nc
I am in relation where she’s 12 years older thn me. And I can’t tell my parents. We both are in true love and we both want to be married eith each other. How to convince parents and What to do?
Such a beautiful story

एक लड़की को देखा लड़की ने तो लड़की को लड़की से प्यार हुआ... एक घटिया फिल्म
Its amazing movie. <br>People are saying that Sonam Kapoor looks lame in this movie. I don&#39;t agree because the character of Sweetie represents the lady who has suppressed her feelings so she is fully playing her role. Its amazing one. Set Love Free. <br>Thank you for the great movie. <br>Love and respect from Nepal.
Beautiful
So sad to hear it won’t be releasing in certain countries.<br>Unfortunately including mine—Pakistan. 😭<br>I rlly wanted to watch this. I’m rlly happy these people are working to use the power of media to influence people, and change their medieval mindsets.

look at all the comments people think it&#39;s a positive movie that&#39;s the reason so many broken families in India just look at the ratio and people r sleeping that&#39;s how slow poison of media works that u forgot what&#39;s right and wrong just look at the condition of Americans Europeans all broken families next it is india dont worry people sleep and enjoy illuminati and free masons bullshit
a family spoiler movie its  brain washing machine but people of india r totally in the hands of illuminati they think it&#39;s very modern that a woman can stay with woman and a man with man what a ghatiya thinking they r injecting your brains with illuminati poison
Nice..anil kapoor n juhi chalwa are awesome..juhi after long time❤❤..sonam n rajkumarr❤❤

About time it was made like a mainstream movie. Go India. That&#39;s progress.
Yey to lesbian ha 😂
Awesome movie <br>I loved it <br>you should watch it
All ppls who is supporting this shit i think u got paid well long positive comments.
every single gay person is here to support this agenda ..so a game is guys some dumb ppls are trying to legalize LGBTQ in Asia. And the best way is to make a bollywood movie ...trust me no hatred from my side but u all need to concern a doctor or physiologist and they will let u know in a better way that this bullshit can cause more damage to human brain then a nuclear bomb.....men are men and women are women we all believe in God so even for a SEC can u think that the God was mistaken while he made women for men and men for women...its all about the belief. thats it u have a wonderful day      .
Love anil kapoor😍
Tamil lum dubbed panuga da...
If such kind of thinks is going to be happen I think this will be the end of the world woman+woman=no humans and Same thing will occur for man+man=no human and later on different kind of diseases will appear so people who are supporting it I think are senseless so shame on them
Shame on you anil Kapoor, money is not everything, you people sold your soul, you people are destroying the culture of india, shame on you,
This world is becoming like hell.....go towards spirituality and intelligence people...instead of towards materialism....all these joys are temporary...it is just foreign agenda to manipulate our youth and control population.....these people are nothing from inside.

I things wonderful movie...
Watched movie without watching the trailer. While watching it felt like some regular shit movie until interval. The second half is such a promising and revolutionary in Bollywood. Good job.
Today I saw this movie and it&#39;s actually a great story and most important kind of true story even though the law has given the permission but the thinking has not changed yet at all over all I think it&#39;s the best movie of 2019 really loved it...
twist: she is lesbian...
Lesbian movie and now Bollywood  is totally doing the job brain washing
Director Shelly Chopra Dhar makes a breezy first half that takes the best of a Wodehouse story and comes up with a sunny, happy entertainer. It&#39;s when she takes on societal prejudices and throwing light on a couple but continues to take the pre-interval approach that the cracks in her missus begin to show. And even though her lead actress does a sincere—but skimming the character&#39;s surface—job, it&#39;s the rest of the cast that shines and props up the movie all through. Meanwhile offscreen, the movie&#39;s producer continues to don the mantle of a life and music coach.

These Bollywood industrial businessmen. Thier God is Money and Alominati agenda. Anil&#39;s Sonam get married to a Man. But teaching other  bisexual .. all this agenda for poors and middle class peoples. .
Lanat han es movie p or es ke pasand karne walo p.
Lesbian movie hai bhai
Yeh kis tarha ki gaand phaati luv story hain yaar??!!

Why to create and promote movies which are against the ‘law of nature’???? <br>This is goin’o lead  to total destruction
Lesbian story, jo hindo samaaj k b khelaf our nature ka b khelaf, Lanat
How cheap they all belong to Illuminati and promoting Vulgarity everywhere people need to understand this ALLAH created us in pairs Man and Woman not man for man and woman for woman this is cheapness at it&#39;s peak should stop this Yahood are the main reason behind this

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8h78hCck3U&amp;t=28s
Nyc. Moviee
So who is she in love with? No other woman really shown in this trailer
castim and religion wali love story se bollywood pak gya, ab ye le aaye. theek h but content naam ki bhi cheez hoti h.
Of course they chose the family to be a Muslim one. There would have been riots had they made it a Hindu family.

Sach kahoon to LGBT community pe is movie ko bad comments isliye ni mile kyuki it talked about lesbian (girl) relationship. Agar gay (boy) relationship ke baari Mai hoti na to logon ka perspective alag hota<br><br>Sad Hypocrisy 😶

I can&#39;t believe that this is pretty much the first mainstream Bollywood lgbtq+ based movie and I can&#39;t go watch it... I&#39;ll be sure to watch it as soon as I can, of course but as a lesbian myself, I feel really bad that I won&#39;t be able to watch it in the theatre. <br><br>Anyways, lots of respect to Sonam Kapoor for having the courage to play this character and to the writers, director and producer for finally making this happen.
Simplistically Beautiful Film..... Loved it.....🤗🤗🤗
Sala south film super khiladi 3 se same
Ok another love story ! Why all films are love stories
Pole twist: sonum is married
with all due respect,<br><br>these relationship with same gender could work in high society or metro cities but indian society as a whole will never accept it! <br><br>i was speaking to my wife about lesbians and its still a very big tabbo because many women and men in india cannot even digest the concept that same gender people can be in love
aaj dekhi mene theatre mai kafi achi hai👌👌👌👌👌
jo boys ye movie dehhe ya fhir chutiya hai ya fhir gay hai

Content looks kick ass but execution is the main suspense . Whether it pans out traditional bolly type or like the new bolly which is really exciting  .
why bollywood now a days always roaming around lgbt movies?...Why not taking any socially relevant  subjects other than this...please do inspire from south indian movies...which always carries a socially relevant message which are related to poverty, farmers&#39; plight, dirty business of education institutions, dirty political games, against women rape etc...thtz why most of the people like south movies...bollywood always concentrated on love movies or these kinds of gay movies...no varieties..plz do change👍👍👍👍...
Eee......<br>No worth watching it
It&#39;s a lesbian love story
Why we supporting <a href="http://this.ye/">this.ye</a> ek bimari h jiska ilaz ho sakta h. Koi future nhi h sath hi sath medical rog jo hote h vo alg se. Agar aaj ki generation esi movie dekhegi to unhe to ye shi lgega na. Hmare culture me iski koi manyta nhi h. We should not approciate this and we should denied it.
Release hogai kia ye movie ...im dying to see this couple in a romantice love story 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Sad to see that day 1 collection was 3.30cr...c&#39;mon audience this is what cinema should be...
Just saw the movie.. The movie brilliantly showcased the struggle such people go right from childhood... The movie doesn&#39;t hurts the sentiments of the community.. And there&#39;s where the movie wins...
Ciyapa lesbians  😂
Life of LGBt people z so difficult ..they r never accepted by society or sometimes their own parents .they harbor their pain nd admiration nd also never be able to explore yourself bcoz this society treats them like a prostitute but after reading people&#39;s comments m very Happy ..that there&#39;s a change in people&#39;s now

I don&#39;t understand how the world thinks homosexually is normal. Suddenly. Even though are bodies aren&#39;t designed for it yet we all make it so common. The world is actually becoming uneducated and regressive by going against nature. Seriously sad.
😍💙
Pure kanjar haramzaday
So this trailer has had me confused.... Does she like girls?
Beautiful movie

Beautiful
Woww 😮  a nice bollywood movie after so long time

Sonam loves....who???? Did anyone saw the film...please answer this....???

Rajkumar 👌 👌 👌.
Nice
BIG FAN of Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla and ofcourse Rajkummar Rao. Sonam Kapoor bhi theek acting kar leti hai.. Zaroor dekhoonga yeh movie for the performances.. But the topic? Shitty!! Humein patah naheen kyoon yeh samajh naheen aa raha ke is tarah homosexuality ko promote kar ke hum modern naheen, barbaad ho rahay hain.. West ka ghatiya culture apnaanay ki zaroorat naheen hai East ko.. Humaari young aur upcoming generation ke zehen par kitna ghatiya asar parrega, yeh sochnay ki zaroorat hai.. Zara sochiye!!! PLEASE... Haath jorrta hoon..
shameful story hai, ye toh bharat ki parampara paar agaat karne wali story hai, app log logo ka dimag kharab kar rahe hoo<br>shaddi word ka toh majak bana diya hai yaar usko toh sharir ka sukh lene ki baat bana di hai, are ladka ladka ya ladki ladki se bache nahi hote wansh aage nahi hota, <br>bhai agar kisiko same sex se sukh milta hai toh shaddi kar loge kya haar kaam jisme tumko sukh mile wahi waise toh muje chori kar ke khanne me sukh milata hai toh matab me chori karne lagu kya aur phir bolu ye mera haak hai, bhai chije hoti hai jinka maan nahi hota par karni padati hai samaj ke bhale ke liye ye toh sabko bigadne wali film hai<br>jaise ek nasha karne wala sochta hai ki saab meri tarah hoo jaye me sahi hu baas wahi hai inn logo ka khel usko haak bool bool ke sabka dimag kharab kar rahe hai ye bhand libral sonam, swara ye log

Don&#39;t watch this  movie  worst of money 😝😝😝
Speaking only English, I hope there is an English translation as it looks a fabulous movie.
Wake up people don&#39;t encourage such things God started the world with Adam and Eve not eve and eav or Adam and Adam otherwise the world would have ended as it started Bollywood should not put this rubbish in new generation heads its wrong.
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKcamCgBvMo&amp;t=132">2:12</a> the most iconic scene in the trailer.  Slowly but gradually India is coming out of its shell. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23letlovebe">#LetLoveBe</a> 🇲🇺
Gud naal ishq mitha are bhaiya kitne baar laoge ek hi song wahi ghisa pita <br>Bollywood is Failed
Lesbian movie
Bech do katuo ko apni beti ko katuo do maderchod

I hate how they gave it all away in the trailer itself. Losers.
Astaghfirullah
Laanat hai lgbtq par....
Spreading homosexuality in society
Chhhheeeeeeeeee........thhhooooo......... Kalyug..!  Such sinful feelings are not accepted in any religion. Stop making such movies and Stop promoting such a sinful feeling. Same gender attraction is a mental sickness, use your brain people.
LGBTQ= lesbian,gay,transgender, bisexual, ......Q=???????
Kudos to sonam and team for the brave effort. Amazing!!! Expecting Lot of positivity in the society regarding this movie.
Such a brave step by a Bollywood movie!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23section">#section</a> 377
।।
This is true democracy!!!
Lesson to be learnt: Never go to a first showing of any film without seeing an unbiased critical review. I learnt my lesson today by seeing this picture in London on its first showing. What can I say, the picture is imbecilic to say the least. The plot beggars belief and the acting is below par. And why do they have to have a Mohammedan in every film. In this film there was absolutely no need. It could have &#39;worked&#39; without the Mohammedan character. The killer blow is when the film makers try to send out the message that being a lesbian is okay. As a Conservative I am opposed to this &#39;normalisation&#39; of sexuality generally in society. I sympathise with people with this affliction but it is no way &#39;normal&#39; and should not be portrayed as such. When I had seen the trailor, I had remarked that this is nithing but &#39;Anil Kapoor family home movie&#39;. In reality it turned out to be a very boring and morally bankrupt script and the overall feeling of nausea still lingers in the mouth. After the movie, my wife commented that it would have been better to see URI for the 3rd time instead. My rating: 0 *
I am so happy that bollywood is finally opeing up to such genres and this comment section restores my faith in humanity

I think nobody should support this type of people and movie
I pray this type of people should be   punished
It&#39;s a stupid love story and it&#39;s Haram too in Muslim nobody should support this type of love stories or love it&#39;s hated by every religions and every god

Watched Ek Ladki...on the first day of its release today. So relieved and happy that same-sex love is being portrayed in mainstream cinema now.  Hope times are changing.... <br>Thank you to the Ek Ladki film team, cast, producers, everybody who are willing to speak about sensitive topics. <br>Would have loved to see more of Sweety-Kuhu (Sonam-Regina) romance, and more nuances, but a commendable effort in the right direction, nonetheless. Kudos !

Love u juhi chawla..  .😍😍😍😍😍
He&#39;s a lesbian in a movie
wow I wasn&#39;t expecting so many positive comments, really<br>really glad to see the changing atmosphere in our country<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lgbtq">#LGBTQ</a>+RIGHTS
I wont watch it just bcz of karan jo and everyone standing against manikarnika...... Thumbs down.... I dont have any issue with LGBTQ...
Going through the comments section just noticed that there are more lesbians then gay people who are happy for their representation. And also, some straight girls will get the feeling that they belong to LGBTQ community and experiment things. I said girls because, it is very much acceptable when girls hold hands of each other and it would not be much difficult for them to experiment with mutual decision. Am not against it just keeping my views on.
Dusri raand kaun hai...aaj kal radio par bhi kuch 4 raande aa k yahi sab bakchodi kar rahi hai...
Aur LGBT waalo gaand se baccha paidaa kar k dikhao...saalo gaand maarna.. tumko kuch alag kar rahe aisa lag raha hai...
Wahi ghisi piti love story...
When it comes to love stories ..difficult part is facing cast problems  ..n love bw 2 females n males too...
Wait!!! Wasn&#39;t Dostana first LGBT movie???
Sonam has always been different by her unique choices of movies. And she has proved it again.Seeing prime time actors in a lgbtq mainstream movie, and people supporting it makes me love india much more
Rajkumar rao is love wo dialogue ..!!!ye ladki nhi miki toh mr jaunga haye😍😍😍
Great to see a Bollywood movie with a gay love story. Hope it does well!

And a nice movie too and I like the whole movie a lot.<br>Ye alag baat h ke agar Mai details batau to I&#39;ll say ke this could be more mazedar and inspirational along with a game changer
So finally Bollywood came with the topic without any hesitation, objections and with a mainstream cast n crews. Salute to the struggles as the society is changing thoda sa hi sahi. Because I know the battle is still going on. <br>It happens always ke when the discussion is about others then we say ke they should be together or the guardian and elders should understand and blah blah blah... But jab khud pe aati hai to these thoughts just fades away. And we also become pyar ke dushman.. log Kya kahenge, relatives mazak udaenge and blah blah blah

Ewwwww.... This is disgusting... Even the Indians have gay now
Sonam Kapoor is lesbian in this movie!!
Why always Bollywood movie shows that Hindu girl want to marry Muslim boy <br>Why not showing Muslim girl want to marry Hindu boy 🤐🤐❓❓❓⁉️❓❓❓
This will be my first time watching a Bollywood movie! I&#39;m excited to see it!

Why the boy can&#39;t be a Hindu &amp; the girl can&#39;t be a Muslim in the same story ? it&#39;s a fiction right ?
Beautiful ♥ but my only question is , who is playing the role of the other girl ?

I dont know about hotness ,sex appeal or acting but sonam kapoor has the most beautiful face in bollywood after aishwarya and katrina. Given the fact that if she becomes diplomatic like the rest of the actresses m sure she will recive love from all corners. But the sad part is people only wants perfection n bash her left right n centre! Just want to remind u all that it takes a lot to b true n real being a celeb. Hats off to sonam for keeping it real n not caring much about the trolls coming her way .
love this sooooo much😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Awww ye to lgbt ki L wali story hai but cute si lag rhi
Life is too short to hate its better to live, love and enjoy n accept by Wat ur and who u r....

sonam lesbian hogi is film me shyd
O my God my India has filled with unnatural human beings 😔😔😔
Wait, when a guy and go on a date, it is almost always the guy who pays the bill.<br>So, if Sonam and her girlfriend go on a date, who pays the bill?
Good
Nice
She is lesbian

I am straight Indian but massive respect for LGBTQ community. High expectations from this film, really looking forward to it.
as an Indian bisexual and someone who is in love with a girl being a girl myself, I am proud of what Bollywood is doing. Thank you for this
Super fkop
song bahut mst hai but sonam kapur bahut kharab actor hai
So excited for this!!!

I am literally smiling like an idiot after going through the comment section. Thankyou guys for the support. You don&#39;t know the feeling of relief when an Indian brother or sister supports you if you belong to the lgbtqai community
The real question is who is the lucky girl Sonam fell in love with
Hats off to all the actors and the whole staff of this movie to make such a movie. It takes courage especially in a conservative country like ours. Hope things will take a little bit  turn after this movie and make our country, open minded.
Uff India me itny lesbian or gay Han????
Set love free? Promising. Just hoping this won&#39;t spoil the remembrance of that sublimely beautiful 2017 movie &quot;Call me by your name&quot; - Love is love is love...Elio and Oliver are forever painfully etched in memory.
I don&#39;t understand the story, and WHAT secret is she hiding?..can anyone tell me plz😥
Hope..this movie changes perception of people..towards..LGBT.. 👍
Regina Cassandra is playing sonam&#39;s lover role...❤️
This movie is a breath of fresh air 💓 Honestly, these are the stories that need to be told. I had lost hope for Bollywood, but it might be all lost if they stimulate the society into a progressive way of thinking.

True love ??? Kaha hai
Sonam plz stop doing acting..I blame sanjay lila fr ds.
Sonam and Regina. Can&#39;t wait to watch.
She&#39;s playing lesbian (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKcamCgBvMo&amp;t=88">1:28</a>) 2 girls get separated. Its not shameful but sometimes it is a very awkward feeling
After watching this trailer, i am truly understanding the mechanism of movie making and stardom. The formula to make ANY idea normal and even POPULAR. To non-thinking youth. The way this movie making, the straight people who are commenting here, feel gay. Like toxic in our food and pollution in the air, media is influencing minds of teens and youth. They are vulnerable. Striving to make a mark for themselves. I hope they will understand movie making is a BUSINESS. Then need CUSTOMER.<br>Don’t become Zombies
Love u guys you are the best Sonam and rajkumar combo who could have thought salute to the director and actors for choosing such a bold topic and looking forward for the movie and more such movies sorry werote a little too much but was not able to control my emotions
Now the title makes sense it’s not just named after the song
Dammn wth..I&#39;m waiting
What is siyappa 🤔😇
From the 1996 movie fire to this film, our audience has come a long way, kudos💃🌠😁
Anil kapoor is best
Oh jab section 377 ka scene chal raha tha tab I just wished k ispe movie bana chahiye n I just expressed this feeling on a post of Instagram as a comment on it and now it actually became true; thank you so much to grant my wish❤️👌🤗
Finally an indian movie about LGBTQ. A refreshing change.
Nice concept
Kudos to the Indian film makers....they are exploring new and bold concepts and themes...It&#39;s high time the society understands and starts to accept the LGBT community...
I&#39;m an Indian bi teen, seeing this, and scrolling through the comments increases my hopes I have for my country.. When I knew my preferences I was scared.. I still am. Because every good side has a bad side.. But, at least we&#39;re heading somewhere good and that alone makes me happy :)
what i liked was there was no stereotypical characterization
hindu muslim pe film hai pagal mat banooo salo sudar jaooo
pure unnatural   topic  hate this topic  this could be better  and natural
seriously all my   expectations regarding this movies comes to an end and feel so hurt by this topic

Sonam in the movie is lesbien 🤔🤔🤔😏😏😏

Wooow I luv Raj Kummar, but I&#39;m so impressed with Sonam, she&#39;s a great actress nd looks stunning. ..many actresses would be afraid to do these kinf of movies.. .definitely gonna be a hit movie
Yeh log aisi movie kyun nahi bante hai jisme ek muslim ladki hindu ladke se shadi kare? Kab hoga aisa, are they targetting hindus to convert to Islam, If so, then tumhari maa ka bhosda

This is what we call moderanism. Shame for making such a movie. You represent the bad side of peoples in a good way and now wants the society to think of it. India is now changing and this change is harmful. Don&#39;t play with the nature
Sach me aisa hi lagaa aap ne ek ladki ko Dekha to

Love jihad movie ...FYI<br>1. Aamir Khan married more than one Hindu girl not a Muslim girl KEPT<br>the child name name as Muslim<br>2. Saif Ali Khan married Hindu women more than once and left the child name name as Muslim
This is the nuisance that Muslims are creating marrying a Hindu woman and then leaving it away just to create another Muslim<br>Aamir Khan married more than one Hindu girl not a Muslim girl second example Saif Ali Khan married Hindu women more than once and left the child name name as Muslim
