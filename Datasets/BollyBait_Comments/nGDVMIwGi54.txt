In word many kids need help you ever help other kid except u own daughter. Dogs cats takecare their kids humen love all kids
Ssssh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Stop it please. Leave them alone.
Old hags interfering in children&#39;s life
Plesse we.have better things than.to.debate.such.things as should aishwarya have another child <br>So.silly
Aishwarya Rai has done her job after getting married, and gave birth to a daughter. In this case everybody should be happy. She is the one that carries the child for 9 months. So if she says that she is happy with one child. The in laws and the other members of the family, should take her word as gospel.
I really hate forcing<br>If u want convince her but not force
They need actually one more child.
My Dear Star Couple,<br>Congratulations! So thrilled to hear this good news. May your baby be blessed with good health, love and laughter. Thank you so much and Almighty bless and keep you all in his sunshine happiness.
I think having babies must b decided by both of them and not one. Other people should not get involve in their decision be it mother father or in laws.
U please keep quite
That makes no sense. She is 47, is she to give birth my 48? It is difficult for women to even get pregnant after 35. Apparently Aishwarya needed help to have Aaradhya whom she gave birth to quite late at the age of 38. It was a geriatric pregnancy as she was over 35.
So what this also being wife of star u want us to inform u if u rvgood female r wife r daughter in law get another three more that&#39;s Good u r worried about beauty u r good for nothing

Money is soo important than someone life unsubscribe you...
Aishwarrya Rai hates Bachans actually... She must take divorce and marry salman he will agree
Hum loggg 10/..10 bachy karty hen yeh logg sirff ek py guzaraa woh B larki haaaa.....she is overcaring
Itni dolatt ha ten kids kro
Bachan family IS👑 LUCKY to have legendry 👑woman God 🙏BLESS them all
I think that they wanted another child so Aaradhya could have someone really close to her
Give us proof also
Aishwarya who r a multitalented star we want u in movies specially in a movie like hddcs nd dhoom 2 her figure...
I can believe this rumour alos but i also want Aish to continue  acting. Why should Aish just give birth to another child for bachans sake they invest only interest in abhishekhs career -. -
the man always wants to corner the woman at home. poor selfish people, it is not them who carry.
Aishwarya one cannot always be young. Having children is a blessing. Give some chance for the youngsters. You are adament to act, means you want to flert with the hero&#39;s.
Ye kyu zhel rhi hai is bandar ko...G pe laat maar uske aur apne sapne pora karein Aishwarya
Why is this people&#39;s business to leave comment? What n age we have reached into, trading our precious time for poking into other people&#39;s lives, instead of reading something worthwhile n get a better head 🐱
It&#39;s Aishwarya&#39;s choice y u ppls r poking Ur nose inside her personal life
how selfish on ashwariyas part. she can always use a surrogate. she is in her 40s now so getting pregnant not so easy.
Tho kya Hua theri property sambalni hai.. aur 1 baccha sahi..
I also dont have any siblin😢😢😢
Yeh.. they share their personal matter with you..
It&#39;s true what Aishwarya is saying , but I think she should have given it a second thought to have her daughter get a sibling which will be her company....
Now a days there are other options like having a surrogate mother for the couple&#39;s biological child
I DONT BELIEVE ANY THING YOU SAY.
With 2 children is perfect family.
I think.... Abhishek doesn’t support Aish at all in her career..... Aish never got the support she desreved!<br>She Shouldn’t have married a person like him.
Abhishek is an alcoholic it&#39;s clearly seen from his puffy face
Good luck baby 🤱
What acting? She is not that attractive anymore.
Aish 😍😍😍
looks wnt help u i  da grave better have many kids since she can afford to raise them well.y rejeacting blessing from God.da only child u hve will leave u oneday en has her own life.lets pple tlk but atleast u get kids who might help u in old.ages.i thunk God.i will never stop.hvng kids since they r blessings
I felt really pitty for ai<br>shwarya rai
Who ever is narrating this please check your English and grammer as it is putrid
the aishwarya rai affair it will end in divorce
But what woman can be pregnant is 47 years old, no woman but she can adopt a child no more
ah yes, the one who plays with the fire burns, or the one who sows the wind collects the storm
It shld between husband and wife. But why bring it for d world to know. It&#39;s there personal issue
You guys are talking like they came and discuss their stories with you.
Yes.chote bachchan!
It&#39;s their personal opinion that what they want from their lives.. and if ashwarya do not want to have other child then what&#39;s wrong in this.. it&#39;s here choice and decision whether she wants to have two kids or one..
Wahh bhai wahh!!!!!!.....ek saal ki umar se hee Aaradhya car chala Rahi hai kya????😂😂....kuch bhi bakwas mat failao....
its Aishwariya&#39;s decision
Apperiance nahi appearance Hota hay
I think Aishwarya is right.Most of the time Aaradhya get troll by people. She is very possessive about her one and only daughter Aaradhya. I think Aishwarya want to upbringing properly to her daughter Aaradhya.
This is really unexpected because he is himself only it&#39;s comensence they want to boy child
She is aged now abi sheikh is young
Aishwarya is very lukkky to marry with such guy ..he is not alcoholic even smoking nd belonging to high profile family and is alone son of the bachan family
Bukwas karte ho kisne kaha tuj sey<br>Vo Aish se pyar nahe karta ..tum 2. take ki kuti  ye decide karegi ki Abi Aish sey pyar karta ha ki nahe..<br>Hudd mei raho ..<br>ABI SHEIK  IS VERY MUCH RESNABLE /RESPONSIBLE AND RESPECTABLE  GUY  AND LOVING TO AISHWARYA AS AISHWARYA ALSO LOVES HIM TOO MUCH  THAT&#39;S Y THEY ARE TOGETHER TILL THEN OK DOGI KAHIKI
If they want a child, they will have one.  Poke your nose everywhere.
These r all natural things why u people&#39;s acting seriously
Thats their Good Decision. Why you ignore??????
What kind of twit puts her figure before kids????
Loves his, not loves her daughter. Very poor English!.
Using wrong pronouns all in the video.
No one has the right to tell you what you want for your body. No one!
Leave them pls....
Did she tell you all these?
A lot of things they say are false, but when it’s comes about a happy married between aish and her husband, I believe what they said it’s true, Aishwarya doesn’t seems happy around him
Ja inko bata diya hai unhon ne 🥱🥱🥱
Definitely think it’s her decision and nobody can force her to have another baby.
Stop spreading such news... they r super rich ...thy can easily go for surrogacy if they want
Yes <br>.. agian a gossip that is not true 🙄🙄 . Funny how the media make story&#39;s like this. 😂😂
Its herlife.shweta Should mind her OWN business
Arrey yaar surrogacy karo na....baat khattam🤣🤣🤣
She probably does not have time and energy for a baby, also she is 46 yrs old. It can be a high risk pregnancy. Its her decision..
What nonsense .... She is 46 years old... How can she have a baby now???!!!!! It&#39;s not possible... She must be going through her pre menopausal period...it&#39;s risky and very bad idea to be a mother at 46....
I do not believe she doesn&#39;t want a child
Aishwarya is 46 year old now
Aishwarya ko mentally torcher Kar rahee hai Ye media .. unki family problem hai kyo media peace spoil Kar rahi hai....
Why are you bothering them whether they want 2 Child or 1. Let them live their life.
What is the source
Stop worrying  about  there  personal life.give more important and relevant  news
She is already 45+...i doubt she might be in perimenopausal stage... And give birth now 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
She should have taken another child
This is not true..<br>No body really cares what aishwarya  wants to do ..be it her career or baby decision..there&#39;s more life each individual in this family
So what&#39;s the problem. U have  2 more baby&#39;s dear. Not a big deal.
Why do you interfere?it&#39;s their personal family they will do what they want don&#39;t poke your 👃
It’s normal..abhishek need one more kid...they have much more money...
So what&#39;s the big deal you only have one and she&#39;s big now she needs a brother too
u bich u just spoiling her grace of dignity
U r near 50 u might not  conceive old lady
Well she can&#39;t be a mother again. She&#39;s too selfish to care.<br>No offence but it&#39;s true.
Abey koi kaam dhndha ni h.. Ja k apni family planning kro na
Two kids need to be there .
We want Aish  back in film as like before. It does not matter  to us whether she having one or two or more Kids .. We will still want Aishwarya if she become fatty. After all she is beautiful and talented actress we just want her back..
OMG.. don’t you think having how many kids is a person’s own personal reason and by the way are you able to read a person’s mind to write that she wants only one child. When are you going to learn not to interfere into people’s personal lives...
She had some health issues also by getting pregnant.may be that&#39;s y she is avoiding second child.aradhya was a test tube baby of this couple.
Zindagi jeene k liye power hi nahi , paise v chahiye.
You stupid media, each and everyone have problems, why you bloody media high lights the family problems of this family in particular, did they discuss their problems with guys. Don&#39;t fool the Indian public. Bloody rascals 👊👊👊👊🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
It&#39;s their personal life.
Its aishwaryas wish she already has given a kid to abhisheks parents that&#39;s good enough if she doesn&#39;t want a kid so be it many families guess  have only one kid anyway my opinion.😟🤔
Pathetic media
Have some shame before putting out such base less news....And stop interfering in others life....
Rubbish
OMG..  This is so important news that the entire nation was eagerly waiting to know.... 😡
Stop publishing such rubbish... ur talking As if ash herself came to ur doorstep n told all these
So what happen take another baby nonsense aishwariya
Abhishek   chootiya hahahahah<br>Not a good pair
Aish should agree to have one more baby and learn to take adwises from elders like amitabh bachhan and jaya bachhan
Why do you want to dig into her past ? Just give them peace na.. Live and let live.
It is quite right good decision by Abhishek Bachchan follow and fulfil the family desire.
Ye sb controversy kr rahe hy.. that it..!!! Media bekawA hy..
U bloody must put masala in any topic.
What is so great, if you baby make one. <br>The world is in a dangerous zone of corona, your baby does not make sense at all, feed the hunger
She shows her self as very well bought up and family oriented  so to have a happy family she can always adjust to the family wishes and keep the family happy. This shows she married Abhishekh for the name Bachans. Rani was the right choice for Abhi but bachans broke her heart. Aab bhogtoh. Salamaji shukar hai she didn&#39;t come into ur family. God does things for the good.
Its their life whether to take one baby two or three... Y u ppl n indulging in their life santi se rehne nai dete q...
Nice video keep it up!Hum maan gaye that she doesn’t want second kid so that she can come back to movies.😂😂😂😂😂😂
The evil other daughter duo should leave aish alone!
It s good to have another baby.
Bakwas
Yeh sab Bollywood waale kiya tumharay ghar aa ker news day jaate hain kiya kay hamaray ghar main kiya ho raha hai aa kay apni naak ragar jaaye or duniyaa ko dhandora peet dijye hmm??tum kiya koi khufiyaa jaasus ho jo har wakt in logon ki toh main lagi rahti ho Haan pagal bewakoof faltu aurat!!!🤔🤨😃
Who are those people who are giving such news to the media people? They need to be ashamed to do this.  This is how a happy family gets breaked.
I want to see bachchan  family to react to this video
What is the evidence behind this rumors?
I think chotu is guy.
Abhishek took wrong decision by getting married to ash
Kasrishma is divorced now
Got married with other women divorce her that&#39;s it
Aishwarya Rai can go in for serogasy
Whether aish told to u?????
I totally support decent ash
I think Aish should be the one to decide, not the family members
Age khup zaley aishche.46 age zaley. Ata nastat baby hot.
This is such a nonsense. We will not what is happening in our family,but we will be excited to know what is going on in others family.
This video is senseless and full of shit
Fake news
Hr koi bche paida krta...ye koi anokhi to nhi ....budhi Amma ko 2 3 bche paida kr lny chahie 1 beta to hona chahie zrur ...kuj sal tk ye expire ho jae gi.
If they want another grandchild just give them Corona virus
Why don&#39;t u give one baby
Aishwarya Rai is 45 +
Why media is after them having baby? Its good if they get more kids because beauty is not important
Fake news sucks <br>Stop this shit
Fake video bnd kr
How sweet pal
Their should be some strict punishment for spreading false news....u deserve this.😡
Why the hell do u need to tell ths everytime that she married abhishek after having so n so affairs...just give ur id n then see how people will explore ur history...this is ridiculous. ...n u r telling as if u live in their home.lol😄
they shoulf have 10kids and we poor family should have only one
That’s up her <br>Not for other’s 👍
She should have another kid after all she was successful as a heroine...she has to give another kid....<br>.if God will s she will have one more
Tum laogoko aur koi kam nahi hai Kya? Yeha dunia mar raha hai or tum logo ko celebrity ke personal matter mein interfere karneme tula hua hai. Paisa kamana koi galat bat nahi hai lakin celebrity ka personal life ko ucal nesa acha or koi dhunk ka kam karo especially this time pea.
Nonsense news
Ok now u tell how many you will make ?? If you are so interested in others
It&#39;s her choice.... # neha dhupia
Having baby at age of 46 poor abhishake. Get some knowledge for womens fertility
Lol
Eishhhhh.......
Making baby is the decision made by the parents and not family. You don&#39;t have to have baby because people said you should, you should know what is good for you and be able to decide for yourself after all non of them will help you take care of the baby. None of them will follow you to the labor room so it is her choice to decide if she want to have a baby or not.
Can&#39;t they adopt a child? Or can&#39;t afford🙄😒
So she think Bollywood career is more important then having a kids ??
Ash..... too hard to fight.... even both in career n personal
It&#39;s her choice lop
Why you guys always give wrong  information s who talk in front of you
Kuch bhi bolo gey kya kya bakwas hai 😒
Salman Khan my favorite hai
Banchan family pagal hai is baja se Salman Khan sadi nahi karta
Take????? From where? Do you have babies or just take them?
Simply they should just adopt ababy boy
And you are their family member, they have told you everything.. if you don&#39;t get true news ..don&#39;t make a false one...it might spread hate..though people are intelligent they know it&#39;s fake and won&#39;t spread hate...
Isme galath baath keya hai??bcz she have already girl.but ek din wo sasural jayengi.thab keya hoga bachchan pariwarka??katham??tho unko boy hona chahiye bachchan pariwarka naam age jane ke liye.
Shouldn t it be the decession of a woman and her husband?<br>Making babies iis not a family affair.Even if Abhishek wanred a second child they are married for 13 years now and married at a later age. What was he doing allthis time?
Aish think he life would become an ash,with kids will be a double trouble.shame on her people are happy with four kids also.😊😊😊👑👑👑👌👌👌
Aishwariya should be the one to decide if she wants the second kid or not. If Abhishek wants another kid, adopt maybe lol
Avoir un autre  enfant  c est avec son accord on force pas la femme d avoir un autre enfant  si elle  n ai pas pret je suis desoler , on doit pas la forcer c est son choix , respecter son choix, c est mon avis..🙄🙏
U media has no sense...that&#39;s their private completely...u people are so much interested in faltoos topics
FAKE!
OMG. Who is watching this video during covind 19... Please like here
Agar aysh dusra bacha nh chahti to wo abishek aur aysh ki problem hai tum media walay kisi ki sex life q ghustey ho!!!!
Full bakwas news. Here people are dieing please  think how to get rid of that. Flash some good news. I think in this situation nobody is interested such  type of news
what s the special in this silly fellos ......u people are no another work
Aishwarya is best
Stop talking nonsence man.....did they personally told u all zis crapss....if yes i wanna hear frm them
kuch bhi bolte hooo  ...phn karke batati hain kya yee sab
Lockdown mai land k use karte hai
too much into the people  business,  nonsense stop trying to make news
Now this is what i dont like ,all unemployed in the family and they want one  more  mouth to feed  and only an old man  bearing the burden for the whole family and to add Aishwarya  sure would  lose her beauty after  second child
Surrogate mamy, like Shilpa✌️
Bakwaz banth karo.. Stop poking nose in other&#39;s personal life.
Its ashs who has to decide.not to please others she would get pregnant.
16th
It looks like smoky their tell u everything about their life.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Aishwarya is not sexually active she is old n every parts of her body is drying up. All juices of her were sucked by Salman  khan n Vivek  oberoi already. Abhishek is stupid for to have fall in love by looks of Aishwarya.
How do you know ? This is all made up please leave them alone
Kaha se milte hay apko ai news? ?? ....most of the news r fake
It is really foolish to give more prominence to her looks and beauty rather than family. She must be thankful to the Bacchan family for giving her recognition and life to her in spite of all her past relations. But instead, she is acting crazy and making the family members suffer from her idiotic decision. It is better for Abhishek to settle with somebody again.
7 comment too late lol
Omggggg 5 commentt
Her life, her body, her decision.. 🤨
Who is bored hit like
Heeeyyyyyyyy
