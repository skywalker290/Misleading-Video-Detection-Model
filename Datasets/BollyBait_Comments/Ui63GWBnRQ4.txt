All the three characters are equally important but only Hritik Roshan get awards for best actor.
Beautiful
Katrina is cringe af in this film. she ruined hrithik.
Such as bro fantastic life of the friends together more inspire of the film for me and nice thoughts poetry 😀😀😀😎❤️👍👍❤️
You just cant put it in 60 seconds. Every second of this movie is a memorable moment.
Diamond biscuit diamond biscuit jab bhi mood ho kha lo
Hello Netflix walo znmd ki alava bhi Netflix pe achhi movies he
This 1 minute is better than the lifetime of Kangana&#39;s movies.
Gareebo ki The Hangover
Meet netflixmati <br>The best tt channel
One of the best Hindi films I&#39;ve seen<br>Thanks for reminding me of this Netflix :)
Farhan Akhtar is very underrated.
Dilo mein tum apne betaabiya leke chal rhe ho to zinda ho tum...LEGENDARY DIALOGUE
&quot;Can u make one of Ankur Pathak&quot;movie too?
This video saved my 2 hours and 59 mins of my life
It would be the best trailer for ZNMD
It was more like a trailer
Senorita deserved 5 sec
The most OP film of all time
Now I&#39;m gonna watch it 100000000 times because isse pehle alia znmd 2 mein humari saari memories kharab kare yeh bahut better hai
Netflix is the only youtube channal with 1 crore subs and still reads comments and sometimes probably replies them....that&#39;s why i love Netflix❤
It&#39;s not baaghi series which can b shown in 60 seconds...it&#39;s FU©ing ZNMD
The kiss scene had to be there😁
bakwas movie
After 2 Days<br>Triggered Insaan:- so I just watched this 1 min clip and this is relatable af, and today I am going to make a breakdown of 1 min into 15 min for some money from Netflix 😂
Am I the only one who still hasn&#39;t watched this MASTERPIECE but wants too ?
The BEST Bollywood flim❤️
Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara should have a part 2... Period.
Hrithik&#39;s fan like here
Ay yo I thought it was zmde
BAGWATIIII😂😂❤😂😂
Netflix is the best💕
All 3 of them sound like MythPat smh
I love how bagwati is included
Diamond biscuit song 😂😂
When you realize the video is 68 seconds not 60 seconds
This movie holds a special place in my heart ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
wow! you missed the important part! Imran&#39;s conversation with his father. This video could have been better, I&#39;m disappointed.
Meet bagwati
😂😂😂😂😂 litt..
Am i the only one jisne abhi tk ye movie nhi dekhi?😅😅😅
This is not even a picture <br>It is a feeling
On seeing this...i remember one of the stand ups by abhishek upmanyu....nd tada....that&#39;s it.....😂
You should have mentioned washroom prank scene
This is for jee aspirants
Bagwati is the best character in the movie and no one can change my mind about it
Movie which change my life 😇 In better way 🙌🏼
This is called trailer...
It is not 60 seconds ,it is 67 seconds
Two Thousand Pounds
BEST HINDI MOVIE EVER !!!!
So bollywood explained a thing in 3 hours which could be explained in 1 minute..
Diamond biscuit deserves a second on this
Imraan&#39;s confrontation with his father was the most important bit of the film..<br>His character had the most layers.
Why didn&#39;t you mention Imraan&#39;s father
Katrina: Unn chijo ke liye vakt nikalo jinse tumhe sachamuch khushi milati hain...<br>Next scene... Kissing passionately.... 😂😂😂
This movie is much more than to be described in 60 sec
where is the part with Naseeruddin Shah
Phati hui awaj mein &quot;Zinda ho thum&quot;
Mushi Mushi
One of the movie milestones of Bollywood.
Mythpat wants to know your location 😂
The combination of Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar has always made their movies worth watching a million times.<br>Dil Chahta Hai, Rock On, ZNMD.
Senoritaaaaa itna to Krna chaiye tha
Still better than Karan johar&#39;s films
Miss the days bollywood made relatable and sensible movies like this.
Arjun ka phone pheke na is not funny
Basically its TRAILER
Arjun conquered his fear of deep sea diving, Imraan conquered his fear of paragliding, Kabir conquered his fear of commitment. That&#39;s everything you need to know.
One of the most finest and most relatable movies of the century itselff!! ❤️❤️ Thanks Netflix!! @netflixindia
&quot;Is not funny&quot;  at least ek bar to rakhna chahiye tha😅
Worst movie of hrithik roshan
Netflix really thought that someone hasn&#39;t seen the movie.....
This is the kind of movie that you can&#39;t watch in 60 seconds.... Every second in this movie is precious and says something 😘
Y’all missed the part when Kabir and Natasha are Fighting and Farhan Akhtar comes in and picks up Bagwati from the ground <br>Damn the gasp on that scene gets me every time 😆
Bye bagwati 😞
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS
❤️❤️❤️
My Most favorite Movie 🥰🥰🥰<br>Lines is So hart touching
Netflix india:spoiler alert ahead<br>People who watched it literally thousand times: 😑
ZNMD is a Emotion 💗🤞
BPL and bathroom prank also deserved some seconds  😂😂😂
Words will never be enough to explain what I feel for this movie ❤️
Ye jo sannate hainn.. waqt ne sbko bannte hain..
This movie gives a great lesson.. <br><br>Dilon main betabiyan le le chal the ho to Zinda ho tum..❤️
Heyoo admin what&#39;s up??
Sorry but this one of the best movies and I don&#39;t think it can be expressed in 60 seconds you have to watch the full movie for it.
We  want znmd 2 badly
In 10 seconds : Three childish men with tons of wealth go to Spain to jump from a plane ,play with tomatoes and spout philosophical bullshit .  In the meanwhile somebody bought a handbag for a woman who looks like a toddler
Those  people&#39;s who  have  this  movie  in mobile... 👇👍
Perfect.
why did i have chills in the last line, even though i have seen this movie like 10 times?
Netflix Make this video exactly 1 minutes, those 7 seconds annoy me
I want to go to a becholer trip.
This movie is so damn overrated
I saw it in 30 sec just go in 2x
All time favorite movie
Watched it many years ago . Forgot everything 😂 but nvm will watch it again someday..
Fav movie ❤️
Kindness is a vast color that only your heart knows how to paint.

Gamers - let&#39;s do Minecraft speedrun<br>Netflix -let&#39;s do movies speedrun 😂😂
Watched it so many times that you can put the movie on mute and listen to me saying all the dialogues with the expressions, tune and also the songs..<br>Maybe I&#39;ve watched it more than a hundred of time....
Love this movie ♥️♥️
Petition To Make Shashwat Chaturvedi as the official PM for Netflix
We need theses kinds of movies but ........,....
If Netflix does every movies in 60 seconds I won&#39;t even have to take their membership.....you&#39;re going broke neflix, real soon.
The best movie I&#39;ve ever watched! Every scene of the movie is so beautifully created! From Imraan&#39;s jokes to Arjun&#39;s anger to Kabir&#39;s innocence.....just beautiful!
