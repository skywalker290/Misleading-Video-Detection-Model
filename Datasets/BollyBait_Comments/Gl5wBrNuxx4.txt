Kon log yeh song 2024 main sunn raha hai ?
I am a person who totally alone in life don&#39;t know why people dont like me, since my childhood even when i was a child people never liked me, never in my school lofe i could make a friend. I dont know why I can&#39;t  talk to people, if I am alone I just be myself, I speak properly but when I communicate to people I start talking faster and can&#39;t express myself properly. Others think that I am weird and rude but nobody knows what goes in my mind and what I have gone through.But day I will definitely show who actually I am and take the revenge.Everybody will Respect me and ask for my favour and the day will come really soon
Just love this movie❤
I am feeling the same pain even in the case of crush😢
Ek dil hi to tha , wo bhi humse sambhala na gaya 🫰🏻💔
How many feel that &quot;what about mny projects&quot; could have been excluded
I am really hurt it is enough 😭😭😭I cannot handle this i am giving up😢
I&#39;m addicted for this song...bcz of my tragedy lyf🫠
Feel that song 😶❤️‍🩹✌️
I wont to watch this after my exam❤❤
I can&#39;t concentrate on anything.. always disturbing and negative thoughts around me .I am feeling like i am weak and powerless can&#39;t do anything. I want to cry and scream as much i can but i can&#39;t. I am distancing with my friends but i want them. I am just feeling lonely around them. I am faking with my smile around..I am angry with my mom..don&#39;t even want to talk to her..I sleep over and over to escape from all..I lost myself.. I dont know what to do.
When you don’t want to move on from the person you love you love the most 😢😢😢

As a girl, this song hits differently  when your are lost, depressed, failed
Koi Mujko Mujse hi bachaye Fantastic line
Nice to express feeling 😢
Value them before you think you lost them waqt to chla jata hai aur apne saath logo ko bhi le jata hai
Dec 2. She said no. For now and for future. Only friendship.<br><br>Thankfully, I had almost already embraced solitude till end. This was the final nail.
I think the world of Dreams is far better than Reality...
I love to read such depressed comments.. it make me feel I&#39;m not the only one😂😂
Sometimes I think imaginary world is the best I don&#39;t want to live in the real world.
Priyanka Choudhury from Bongaigaon Assam, Listen this song,,...u will be realised, what u did # AbhiPriya

My life exactly
this song always gives me satisfaction in painn , everytime i feel like quitting like UGHHHHHHH
Alias acting in this song except at end wat about the ..excluding that the rest is phenomenal and amazing..a pleasure to see the sincere effort come out in a blaze..sometimes she is really surpassing
This happens in married life too but problem is that bf gf relationship can be broken easily than that of couple since so many relationships are connected.....how to say just go to hell dil and move ahead
Men also suffer like this 🙃😊
In search of gold,I lost the Diamond..😢😢
Nowadays Bollywood can&#39;t make these songs even if they try😢
i realised this hard many years ago that never to cry for a guy =, but now i am into that phase again where i am crying again. i dont like myself being this vulnerable.
Cheelu padam enthonedey ithokke.
2 years back I was also dying to talk to that who has literally abused me , lies to me and made fun of me behind my back <br>But now although the urge to talk to him is not there anymore but I still feel so lonely . I literally have no one to talk to everyone was there when they needed me or wanted something from me but now I don&#39;t have a single friend and about the family who is supposed to support me and love under all the conditions thinks that I am a shameless bi*h who only talks to boys <br>It&#39;s hard to survive especially when you can&#39;t even tell anyone how you feel or what you are going through and when you don&#39;t have anywhere to go

😂😢❤⚖️🙄🙈🤣🎶😏💩
At the time of watching this movie I didn&#39;t understand this song is made fr me
Don&#39;t cheat anyone plz..break body but not heart
When someone, after sharing a kiss, mentions that there isn&#39;t any relationship chemistry, it can be disheartening, leaving you pondering how your connection, which started as a friendship, arrived at this conclusion.
Whenever I got depressed... Il be here... Idk y.... May be this is so relatable.... Sometimes feel like everything is around us but we cant feel anything but complete loneliness...
Boys think girls have no heart ..<br>😂<br>So boys kindly live one day life as girl in those days 😢😅<br>Then say ........<br>Love from Pakistan🎉
Jaha say hum juzray agar vaha say koi juzray na ..woh ab tak guzar gaya hota …
Perhaps they also realise and know that if they could just simply apologize then they wouldn&#39;t have to carry on with their acts anymore.<br><br>It&#39;s a simple one time thing versus headache of so many years but guess what they choose to do...<br><br>Your guess is as good as mine.<br>🥲
It&#39;s silly how guilt can drive people to do so many things that they were so incapable of earlier. <br><br>Yet , courtesy of a simple apology face to face remains elusive. <br><br><br>For these people, it&#39;s better to keep lying and continue with one&#39;s inflated sense of ego then to ever bother setting things right.<br><br><br>Perhaps they also know that, things don&#39;t easily set right and come back to earlier state, once set into motion.
The guy I broke up with 2 weeks ago, I saw him with another girl yesterday. It just hurts to know that he was my first, but I was nothing to him. All the moments we spent together meant nothing to him.
How can anyone remain soo happy after hurting others feelings who remain loyal to him a long it just destroy ur mental health even the tears started drying but the pain become deeper day by day u r not able to show what ur feeling inside💔
Y̤o̤ṳ
Is here anyone jo mujhe ye bataye k kya main depression k kisi stage par hoon ??
I want peace not problems
Living is very painful for u when you want to die
I love you all... because no one loves me

2 years of insomnia 😞
Same thing happen to me.he cheated on me for another girl of my neighbors I don&#39;t understand what to do
These typical Delhi girls, they r so irritating fake and uncultured people. Don&#39;t know what relationship is just know how to create drama and then disturb other people life... that&#39;s what Alia is representing here. Boo her . Boo alia 👎👎👎👎
What if that battles are between your closest one with blood relations
Why this song soo relatable ...❤
Best depression song ever 😢😢😢😢😢.2.55 Am.When you are struggling with math but still will not get good result 😭😭😭 aur mummy papa k tane toh haa e hi 😭😭😭😭😭 .Yeh aur bardas nahi hota
story of my life
When I told people that this movie is my favorite back in 2016, they thought I was weird. They still don&#39;t get the message of this film. How could they not understand that we are actually going through this stuff just like Kaira. Depression, expectations by society, toxic relations, overachiever who is now struggling to settle down, Lonely and passionless who once had everything planned out.
That line of the song dardo ki aadat si lag gayi hai , aansuon bhi meri hasi udaay 🙃
Within seconds... 🤣🙏👀
Kbhi bhi kisi pr itna bharosa Mt krna .......ki ye din dekhna pde 😢
Love give me pain. If you other side left you to go to hell then chest pain like burn. Eye droplets live hot water.<br>But love is love 💕. Always love my wife my beautiful deha❤
This song hits different when you are going through depression 😔😞
Just go to hell dil!!
Every lyrics feel like own story...
For me singing this song z a happy pill
Indians are good at scripting movies but when it comes to Lyrics they fail big time..
Protect your heart from people!!! Becoming Heartless  is the best thing you can do for yourself!!!!!!
Full movie besess on my life
Sometimes I feel help less
This song means alot when things don&#39;t go as expected for us humans

Depression isn&#39;t a joke. This is how it feels like :&quot;)
Abandoned,  words<br>collapsed, dreams<br>collide , heart <br>silent, tears<br>perfect synonyms narrate me.<br><br>Wanna stay alive <br>sounds utter deeper more than ever.<br>already in grave of hopeless ,<br>contradict aforesaid.<br><br>Forever wanna , stay young <br>sounds dramatic<br>the desire, inundates<br>meaning of life, fate ,destiny.<br><br>it all get tangled up inside<br>no words can express it enough .
This song is like healing therapy....

To everyone reading this comment, I hope you get into a better phase than the one you&#39;re dealing with now. Enjoy, make memories, take every piece of life with open hands. Never intentionally hurt anyone. Be a reason for people to believe in humanity, love and respect.
You know when u want to cry but you cnt.,u want to explain someone how u feeling.,but u cnt put it up in words.,a weird physical pain.,sleepless nights.,lonely.,lost.,career is struck..your mind is not stopping..you are overthinking everything..you just dont wanna give up.,you are trying but people feel you are lazy.,depression and anxiety is ruiening you each day  u are just running away pretending like everything is fine..faking a smile..coping with everyone and evrything..But u are just tired and dead inside....
Mere ko kyu toda❤
koi mujhko, mujhise bachaye!!!!!!!!!

Where can I watch this?
The last scene where she vents out her frustration by typing nuisances but never sending them to the person who caused the depression is so relatable.... But lastly she ends up sending the &quot;miss you&quot; text shows that how our mind becomes co dependent on others for our happiness when we become too clingy for the relationship or attachment from that &quot;one&quot; person who in reality is just &quot;many&quot; out of millions in the crowd of the mean world.
You better go to hell such a shitty lyrics 👎 I love you my Dil ❤ terey ko kuch nai honey dugi ❤️😘🤪🤣
i listen this  song everyday watching the moon ....
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😅
So-so Beautiful GANA and sunidhi Mdm voice.
I thought having brain was a blessing, my own memories ruins me!😕
I&#39;m listening this song again and again whenever someone really close to me hurts me I listen this song and get more depressed even some time I cried till not able to breathe but after listening this song I&#39;ll be more stronger and heartless

When it&#39;s your b&#39;day and you are crying because of the wrong guy...
Nothing compares to the satisfaction of breaking glass things when you&#39;re restless. And nothing compares to the frustration when you know you can&#39;t break anything.
Perfect for those like me who fall behind wrong ones and suffer wake up u are not made for those fake ones just lead ur life happily
Still too relatable🙂
Completely relatable<br>Current situation of life.<br>Don&#39;t know life is going on which direction 😌
This is my life song
Depression exactly feels like this
family problems+insecurity = end.<br>   But sometimes we had to give life second chance .
Damn .....same situation
When you no longer wish to be happy....i mean... just neutral...just don&#39;t wanna be sad or lost all the time...a normal life is alll i want..
What is annoying that I&#39;m in not in love with someone, but in love with the idea of them. Basically in love with love and getting hurt out of nowhere. So please, just go to hell dil
I had a break up. I don&#39;t know where I have been wrong. May be I was too honest in showing my emotions. I shared everything with him. My daily life. For the first time, I dreamt of a life..where he was with me. I never spent so much time besides my study on anything. But my every half of evening was given to him.  He said he is fed up ...he told me to fuck off.<br>I endured his every word, that pain which I was given ....I endured the humiliation. But I was happy cuz atleast he said that word &quot; fuck off&quot; . So I am now not guilty. He said ,now it all depends on you, what steps you will take i. Future. I have a time limit of four month, till then I can&#39;t talk to him. <br>I thought I would give him my first kiss, but before that everything was messed up ...<br>I am broken.... somehow I listened to this song, as he have health issues, I can&#39;t let him take more burden...I don&#39;t want him to feel frustrated, so I decided to stay away from him. But it feels so lonely. I don&#39;t know how to handle my emotions...but I hope time will make my love more passionate for him
Jo bhi trust yah Dil thore please just go to hell
Tomader keu case ay na detey  paruk.Tomader key case na detey paruk. Tomadee  key  case na detey  na paruk. OPPOSITE  NA HOK.Opposite na hok  OPPOSITE  na hok .

This song has told my emotions really bored of my life
I love you so much❤❤ Alia bhatt
Song is anger and pain... directed towards oneself
It&#39;s Sunday afternoon..i have been crying for past 1 hr.<br><br>It all started with me wearing a jeans with a knee length kurta..dad asked to change the jeans and my mum supporting dad.<br><br>And ended with...a girl like u will ruin the family..U r a girl that nobody deserves..U r a saddist ..WHY DONT U DIE ( yes literally go DIE ) ...We wasted our life raising a girl like u..<br><br>I am 22 yrs old girl and  not financially independent...can&#39;t handle this toxicity anymore..not only this ...a lot lot more ( literally so much)<br><br>I have been mentally depressed from when I was 13 yrs old..and these talks are happening atleast thrice in a week..and I feel like killing myself everytime..but not having the fearlessness to die also...No matter how much I try , I am unable to mend this relationship with my family..<br><br>I will complete my studies in around 8 months..I hope my life will change for better ! <br><br>Venting out here kind of gives peace ✌️

When you question where did I go wrong in life know your with wrong people or in wrong mindset.
without any reason he said breakup and now he is saying we will be as friends🙃
Abaa
Even after becoming a doctor life is been pathetic to me failed my exam it&#39;s really humiliating going from one door to another for a good job but no way out feeling shit useless can totally relate to this song it affects you badly when your peers are doing good in life but it seems like all sour lemons life throwing at me only
I mean that&#39;s a brilliant movie Karan Johar has ever invested in 😅

Even if you forget mahesh bhatt, Aalia is born to act
Sometime what we really want is love, reassurance, support but either of them matters when the voices inside our head wins. You want to scream so hard, you want to cry your heart out but even after doing all of that won&#39;t make you stable, it wouldn&#39;t bring back the peace or the person. <br>Heartbreaks aren&#39;t as simple as we think it is. <br>A battle between mind and heart isn&#39;t simple. <br>Take care you&#39;ll. You&#39;ll find your way back somehow, you&#39;ll become stronger and when you look down you&#39;ll be happy cause it was real and it happend. <br>And this you is gonna be me. <br>I hope it will
Each and every person is selfish<br>Sometimes someone parents too<br><br>No one for you<br>Specifically if you a girl

When depression, just listen this. I wish I can do it but I don&#39;t want other have pay my depression situation 😢 can&#39;t eat or eat a lot. Sleep alot have no idea 😢
👍👍👍
Watching this at 5 am because I couldn&#39;t sleep , it&#39;s been 3 days now
Alone in room + Headphones + Full volume + In front off mirror + This playlist = YOUR OWN CONCERT💥💥💃💃
Nobody cares how I feel 🖤
Are all humans are same 😞 just everyone plays with me 💔
mere paas to msg karne ke liye bhi koi nahi hai. all alone with no one by my side. I crave for genuine relationship and friendship lekin sabne iss hadh tak tod ke rakh diya hai ki ab darr lagta hai kisi se baat karne me bhi. har roj khud se jhooth bolti hu ki sab thik hai but a part of me knows that everything is shattered. there is no hope.
I don&#39;t relate anything like I do with this character!!!!
Girls will have broken heart they will never show to people and never blame a person
One of my favourite movie, two reasons first Alia is mind blowing and put her soul in the character. Second the girl I met she was copy of this character and everything happened to Kaira in this movie happened with her also. She was so strong and undoubtedly straight forward like Kaira. Unfortunately I watched this movie after she left and I think I will have this regret always that why I couldn&#39;t find this masterpiece when we were together. Wish someday kisi PAL me she will find this comment..💓

&quot;Koi mujhko mujhse hi bachayeeeee!!!&quot;  This line hits different. 😢😭
He cheated on me ...why ?don&#39;t know he want a rich girl I forgave him,  why i m writing here dont know ...this song give me relaxation why don&#39;t know ...
You&#39;re not alone 🙂❤️
Never let anyone take control of your life, mood or any damn thing. A random guy can cause you to go through this phase all over again. These days relationship has nothing to do with love. You will find yourself attached to somebody in a very unwanted manner. Remember, U will somehow convince yourself that this person wouldn&#39;t leave but the reality is he will. No matter how hard you try u will be all alone at the end. Trust the process and focus on yourself.
Final Semester of college, clinical depression, family pressure of getting a job soon, toxic college environment, fight with a boy when we had feelings for each other and we blocked each other, family wanting money from me asap, not supporting towards my life goals, asking me when u r getting job thrice a day, instead of asking how are you, horror nightmares, fight with elder sister cz I couldn&#39;t study well last semester cz of clinical depression. This song hits me hard. Sufferings all around.
JEE aspirants can feel it , toppers till 10th and face compitition,ups and downs in these two years even after working day and night non stop ...
Masterpiece song from Masterpiece Movie.🥺
Masterpiece film.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Like this my condition also
Anyone listening this 2023😭
I am just so tired of life I don&#39;t want to do this anymore
Alia Bhatt over acting faltu
Jab koi samjhta nhi that&#39;s the feeling. Yaar thak gyi hu bas
I Like it  very good
sometimes we just want to run away from everything, everyone, and even run away from ourselves, you just don&#39;t have to put your faith in anything, just get too tired from everything, and everything becomes scarier...want an escape from everything but don&#39;t get any...but please don&#39;t think its end...just know this all thing will end at some point of time, you don&#39;t need end yourself, just a little time...there might some hidden door whose key is well hidden in time, and that door might lead you happiness...
Life was easier but now it appears that im the only who made it worst . Nobody is believing me , not my parents, family, my love no one . This is the toughest stage of my life , i have lost everything it appears that dying is easier than living this painful life
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl5wBrNuxx4&amp;t=13">0:13</a> gave me peace.
Came to this video after getting dumped yesterday on Valentine&#39;s... 5 years of live in and suddenly the house feels empty.
Where should I hide to be seen again ?
It&#39;s just .....I don&#39;t know whether it will ever end
I no longer know what I feel<br>It&#39;s not even pain anymore

I relt this
No therapy is better than this one song. Everyone, everything hurts but this heals
us bro us
No matter how good you are to others they will be only there until you meet their expectations or needs. All I have to say is  Just Be Good To Yourself..Listen out to your inner voice ...More power to those are in their healing stage 👏
I found this movie so relatable:) sometimes feel like to attempt suicide:)))
❤️❤️........
Does anybody have suicidal thoughts?
i can feel this song now!🙂 Ilovehim&#39; You Are Everywhere But not in my life!ImissYou, IloveYou! i miss Everything single talk&#39; every single Thing!
This woman isn&#39;t serious about any of her relationships as she sleeps with someone else while being committed to a good kind hearted person as seen in the movie and then whines when the other guy dumps her for not being serious. Such women should be publically humiliated and shamed online. They deserve it
I can understand herrr completely 🙂
Family problems+betrayal from loved ones.. Financial  issue....failing career nd much more 😊💔
Move on is not easy 😭
Koi feeling nhi hai mera okay👍...... Kabtak bhagigi Tu jawab to dena he hai tjhe aaj ya kal bach nhe sakte hi tera game over🎮❌ ha ha ha ha
don&#39;t know how to handle this anymore, the breakup happened almost 5 months and it was a bad one, still not over her, I love her so much and I wish we could be back together someday....!!!!
Depression+ Anxiety+ Faking smile every day+ messed up education+family issues + comparison + exams every month= my life 🙂<br>What a great way to start 2023
I felt this song 🥲
Waah alia bhatt ji kya pyara song banaya 👌
best for me🥺🤍
Some people are just like a kite. Keep flying once the string is held in someone&#39;s hands. Never think the person holding the strong might get tried. They don&#39;t let it go because they feel hard to do so.
Hate life 😔😔+ fake friends+ no loyalty+ depression+ crying= life just go to hell 💔
Same now a days
Whenever i feel so bad with my life,i&#39;m here to listen this song..
We will survive
Depression is not a jock.........

This song explain my life 💔
Hum Kiya lonely happy nahi rahe sakte?
Woh kahata hain ne family jitna pyar koi nehi kar sakta ..vasa hi family jitna dard  koi nehi da sakta.. Ab mujha he dekh lo mera 5 years relationship maina  breakup karliya.. Just because main apni papa ki asu nehi dek sakti ek loti hu .. Or papa jisa  mara liya pasand  kiya hai uska sathe last 2 years sa hu jabardasi ki relationship main .. Kitna dada hota hain ya koi dusra nehi samjha ga ..next year sadi hain mera ..din rat vagaban sa yahi parthana karti hu ki sadi sa pahala mujha utha la ..
Dec25 I cried
Me as a teen😂
Iam so mentally tired I feel I can’t make it anymore
Just go do hell dil (indian accent lmao) 😂😂
Man shant toh sab shant om namah swaha to those memories.
Yahan se kaha jayu mai, kahan chup jayu
Tute dil tute dil kaya teri mushkil....
This song is closest to my heart
koi mujhko mujhse hi bachaye &lt;/3
I was like this but I found love and that love completely healed me..
Sometimes I just want to cry loud but I can&#39;t because of family...dude family problem is also big problem and in this there is no any solution....love this line yaha se kaha jau kaha mai chhup jau😣
مايحزن هوه فارق العمر بينهم

Gth
It&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl5wBrNuxx4&amp;t=642">10:42</a> now and I&#39;m listening to this song again and again while roaming around in my home. I&#39;m someone who&#39;s struggled in life so much, felt pain, being traumatized, everything. But i was healing, i was started to being happy again, gaining that confidence again, Loving myself again, but damn here we go again, I&#39;m back to the place where I had been two years back. Depressed, confused, underconfident, and alone. The thing is I&#39;m getting down in my carrier day by day idk the reason, i was a top grade student but I&#39;m failing at it constantly, and the people&#39;s who used to appreciate me for my perfomances and my talents are now disappointed at me just for the way I&#39;m acting rn, everyone has their own assumption of my behaviour, but nobody has came to me and asked me the reason behind why I&#39;m acting this way. I&#39;ve recently figured a thing about my relationships that, all of them are with me just because of their own expections, they love me  only until I&#39;m feeding their expectations. And here we again, idk how much it will take now to heal. ( Idk if this will make feel anyone weird, i just wanted to vent my feelings out as I&#39;ve no one to talk)
Just  hate everything...........
Filim name para
Hamesha kahi na kahi depression ki ashli wajah confusion hi hota hai 🤜🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

3:54 am 🙂
I loved him so much and he used to say that he&#39;ll never leave me in any situation...we fought so much but every time we used to fix it because we both can&#39;t leave without each other...but we always hurts each other... actually the fact is, you always hurts someone who loves you, whenever we fought i always used to cry i always thinks that if he could leave me...?then??...but there was a fear of losing each other...we done so many sacrifices so many effort for each other...and I always feel so peaceful whenever I was with him I feel very lucky to have him in my life we always stay....now, he lefts me❤️‍🩹but this time...we can&#39;t I never expected that he could done this to me even I&#39;m still expectating that he&#39;ll come back to me even I cant imagine that he never loves me just because he lefts me, it doesn&#39;t mean that we are done, it&#39;s only done for him but not for me I will wait for him if he could not get back, still I&#39;ll i will keep loving him, he just gone from my life but not from my , heart my mind my memories my everthing he will always remain in my heart and I hope he&#39;ll come back to me❤️‍🩹
Going through
Everything is good, it&#39;s all fine, you have everything, yet it&#39;s not enough, it&#39;s just not enough.
I hate the fact that I can relate to this....
Kahi sunna tha maine ye<br>Ki hame hmesha dimag se sochna chahiye dil se nhi kuki hamara dimag upper hota h aur dil neeche. Aur ye baat mujhe kafi sahi lgi.✨✨

Still listening in nov. 2022
Everyone sees our anger, no one sees our pain 💔
@aaditi kaushal there is nothing that can&#39;t be changed whatever you can thought of can be done.<br>Stay strong <br>I have been in the situation and I can relate to that.<br>More power to you aaditi
It must have been weird for Alia his dad had affairs and kissed his daughter. Great movie.

I can see myself througth alia.....

I heard this song a very long time ago but I was totally fine at that time <br>But today suddenly this song came in the recommendation and I started listening to it but I became too emotional and I couldn&#39;t finish it <br>Such an amazing song ❤❤❤❤
If you feel lonely, listen to this song.  What a strange pain loneliness is, I say it&#39;s the national anthem of loneliness 🙂💔
I have gone through this very very painful 💔😢
So may be I have started living with the fact that I can&#39;t be perfect and hoon main aalag I can&#39;t help it🙂
Anyone has movie link?
Alia acted really well...
Suffering from disability, career stress loneliness controlling parents and alot .
Depression is the biggest truth of life nowadays.
😔
He left me alone in a different places, different country with strangers. He just left. I came here for him, for our relationship, for a life that he promised me.
Same feelings.....same happens ....iam facing or more then this video .....😔
Help me 😔
It is the film that changed my perception about Alia 🤗
It&#39;s me again 🥺 it&#39;s really hard 😭
माना बहुत दिल दुख रहा है....पर विश्वास कीजिए कुछ भी इस दुनियां मे परमानेंट नही है। हां चलो टाइम बहुत क्रिटिकल है बदलता ही नही पर विश्वास मानिए या तो सब ठीक हो जायेगा या आप खुद बहुत मजबूत हो जायेगे और फिर ये सब छोटी बाते लगने लगेगी....कोई खुश नही है....कुछ न कुछ सबको होता है...जो है उसे एक्सेप्ट कीजिए...एंजॉय कीजिए.... नही है तो मेहनत कीजिए या सब्र कीजिए...लोगो से उलझना बंद कर दीजिए...खुदकी थोड़ी केयर कीजिए...जिंदगी बहुत छोटी है दोस्त...व्यस्त रहिए मस्त रहिए... हरे कृष्ण 🙏
I do not know why but life aisi hi ho gayi hai kuch saalo se... every year is more worst than last year...
Body shaming +social anxiety +strict parent&#39;s +being single+crush committed with some one+committed friends + camera shy+introvert=depression . heal=this song
Go to hell
Jeni, Everytime i play this track i see you on my Mind. <br>I feel (whatever i do) i do it for you.©Bryan_Adams
Why reality is so Hard 🥲
The first two line (Bony) you left no choice to live on my  own..
I hate my family. They never treated me like a human being. I was depressed for years because  of them. Now I am in the process  of getting rid of this shitty family.
This song made me long time Sunidhi and Alia Bhatt fan nobody can create angry and strong songs like this one so much energy and energy 🥰🥲👍🏻
Recharge nisina dhuniya nohoy .👣🌑🐃🦍🦧🐒👨‍🦽🤧👈👙🐕‍🦺🕉
Don&#39;t know what’s happing with me, but nothing feels ok, <br>Have a lot of people around with me <br>But still feels lonely, 🥀
yaar ye depression aysa hota hay?? pehli bar huwa to malum padha😢😣
I wish all who suffering from this pain come out from it ....because its nothing that hurt us its only ego which doesn&#39;t accept that its only one failure and nothing. The failure which is the experience for better relationship ....so guys enjoy your own time with yourself ...Life is all about myths which  starts breaking from our childhood ...so its also just like that ....if you are true loyal in your relationship thats means you are true persons from inside . So don&#39;t say its difficult to move on just say its just experience for our inside growth ...😊🙏
learn to be alone, not everyone will stay....
Indian new movies 2022
I am crying every time listening this song
dil aaj takleef main hain <br>aur takleef denai wala dil main
To those who are actually depressed and are here to write about how ridiculous their life is, just watch the film! You might feel better :-) I just did that and it was a great experience<br>Love you❤️
At which time you are listening this...🙂<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>👇
If you have watched this movie then you should focus on the end part of the movie. Kaira was happy after passing through this situation. All she did was changed her perspective of viewing life/people. You can also do the same. change the perspective of viewing things in life. Everything will fall into place at the right time. <br><br>Remember one thing -&gt;    &quot;THIS TOO SHALL PASS&quot; - Read on good days as well as on bad days.  ❤❤<br><br>You could be happy in this current moment if you choose to be. Focus on what you can change now to make yourself feel better. Life is hard for all of us regardless of one’s situation. Keep Fighting!! You are Strong and Beautiful. 💖💖<br><br><br>If anything, comment down below!! May be I can help you with something.
Never understanding parents+confused childhood+messed up studies+no friends+afraid of everything+depression+don&#39;t know where to start life
💔
Just when everyone shares their part of the story here I&#39;m with my one... I have a  very loving fam with million of expectations which is very easy to fulfill if I was normal but the problem is I&#39;m not and that hurts very much... I&#39;m afraid of hurting them if I become my true self and I can&#39;t live like this forever now tell me what should i do for both of us to become happy.. Confused with life and everything.. 😅😭
bad health +thinking problem.
If you overcome this phase i think you are matured enough in life.
💟💟
it&#39;s very important to invest you emotions to people who care n more than that it&#39;s important to find a person like that... who can understand you who know all ur like dislikes.. <br>those are blessed jiske life me koi h jo usko value deta h kadar krta h ...
It is happning with me right now
My life story :)
When you give chance to someone and they prove to be like everyone else even when they promised to be different. 🤞
it&#39;s very hard to react for everything ...this gives the way that doesn&#39;t mean it

Whenever I miss him I listen to this song it gives me courage and confidence to move on and focus on  myself
🙂💔🕳️
I wish the go to hell part didn&#39;t sound like just godu hai dil 😞
Having selfish brother , having toxic mother who always tries to blame me , having stressful nights , always angry from inside,rude from outside , having unfit body , always worring..no friends,<br>Crying in bathroom, and now tears also gave up !<br><br>Yes I am sixteen ! <br>But my stress is like I am 40 years !<br>I am wasting my youth
💔💔😔
Her and my state of mind is same the reason is different but the situation same the only difference is ab aasu nahi aate
🙂
I am fucked off with my life. I am alone, there is no one for me. My father  left me, my mom take me as a burden. I not able to earn to money. Don&#39;t know what to do. No friend , no family,  no relative  I am alone. I want to get red of those problems and the only way is death but I afraid of it.
Every single person relating this song now a days...
When you feel like shit, and when you feel there is nothing you can do to change what has happened. The guilt and the trauma just breaks you but you have no choice to carry on…damn, life hurts when it hits. This song helps cope with that reality, however painful it might be. To anyone else in the same situation, you are not alone, we shall keep walking, there is light at the end of the tunnel.
No doubt this song deeply hits the soul ... When i am so down that the pain inside me is  unbearable i come here listen this song and also read all the comments ... Like how everyone is dealing with this situation 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Everytime I come here to listen this song when I get hurt.<br>When I have no word to express.<br>When I have no one to share.
Just had breakup today he said he didn’t wanna be with me<br>Nd I don’t know what was my fault <br>This song always get me into feel 💔😪
Depression  hell my life. I face every  moment. I do a beautiful  act as like i am have, i am cool. But i am helpless. Sometimes i think  that someone  will come but its a only dream.
I keep coming back to listen to this masterpiece.. bcz i totally feel this now.. after getting heartbroken a lot of times... I hope everyone heals through whatever they r going on❤️
my favourite song
Parents k dreams poora krna apne dreams ko maar kr, tired of handling health and mental issues, suicidal thoughts, pressure of expectations 😭😭🤣
Mere sath bhi aaisa hota
❤️
Lovely but a little bit messed up family + Good education+ satisfaction+ Fake relatives + one / two good friends + living the life to the fullest thoughts = My life <br>Life is just your perception....problems are always there in everyone&#39;s life but need to face them bravely and we become strong 😊😊✨✨😊😊
Just a reminder in case your mind is playing tricks on you today: You matter.  You&#39;re important.  You&#39;re loved.  And your presence on this earth makes a difference whether you see it or not.  You&#39;re going to be okay ♥️
Fake love + strict parents + irritating relatives + fake friends + depression + no sleep + sad broken crying not stopping + mental thoughts+ acting as I am happy and in inside pain so hard to control = my life 😥
Too tired....of ppl who doesn&#39;t understand me.. I want ppl to select m..not to be rejected /ditched...
This actually my life from two months to know and actually it’s painful

Maybe I need some help ..... Maybe I need some love before I take my life . Am I making any sense ......ughhh ahhhhh it just hurtssssss likeeee helllllllllllll 😭 damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Yaa to ye life ki problems khatam ho jaye, ya main ya phir ye sab kuchh
This song resembling me
I&#39;m burning with pain
इस गाने ने मेरा दिल तोड़ दिया और वह जल गया है
When the whole society criticise us why our family&#39;s can&#39;t stay by our side and say don&#39;t worry we have your back live fearlessly do what you want we are always for you why we have to fight our battles alone with any support why everything is so hard whyyy
I dono if dis song motivates me wen I want to give up on everything or everyone or adds to up to my sorrow 🥺 but at the end I know I will come back again simple 🙂
Mine life too💔
I believe life me ho hota hai accha hota hai koi na koi wjh hoti hai jo bhi hme lgta hai ki ye wrong hua ho sakta hai ki vhi best ho kud ko time do yrr.....sab thik hoga🤗❤️🙌 and yeah life without problems is not life Be positive Be strong ..!!!!!
The portrayal is real.
I just saw myself in this film ..there is a beautiful Life after depression phase ...and I&#39;m enjoying it 😍😍
Food should not be thrown like this if you can buy someone is not able to have onetime of proper food. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23foodwastage">#foodwastage</a>
When ever i suffer in pain i used watch this song ...but the strength i get by reading comments .... because so many people facing same problem so many struggling this inspires me to survive........
There were days when i used to sleep just to escape reality. I don&#39;t drink or use any kind of intoxicating substance. <br>I feel this song to the core but today i am fine.
Its soo painfull
dil just go where ever u want nd leave my mind
Im alone please any one help me...... 😔😔😔😔
As I am cool mood but I just love the tone of this song ,.
I can&#39;t brearup this pain 😭 I wanna die !! 😭😭😭
Infidelity with BFF... is just fucked up... my heart 💔❤️‍🩹
Broken heart +ugly face +lack of concentrate and confidence + toxic family + messed up education + suicidal thoughts + fake friends = My life
My story... No family, no friend, no one to share things, no satisfaction in my present job! <br>I will quit any day 🙂
Whenever I&#39;m down, upset and crying silently... I just come here listen it! 😞
Can feel the pain the teenage relationships !!!
Social anxiety people call me shy
This is not our reality..... No one of us deserves pain .. just give up on all your negative thinking, guilt , blame game, regret . This is my request to you all to stop being worthy of your sufferings. You are what you choose to become, not what has happened with you in the past. Leave all sufferings, mistakes, tears of pain , leave everything behind. I dare you to work on yourself and start working for a better future 🙌♥️.
The feeling when you start hating yourselves 🙃
I just wanna say...It&#39;s okay if you&#39;re not feeling well...It&#39;s okay if you are feeling things aren&#39;t  going your way...Cry your heart out...Cry as much u want...Cry until u feel no more tears are left .... Sleep as much as u want...Sleep as if u&#39;ve been deprieved of it for years... But never lose hope...Always remember there GOD.. He&#39;s always there for u, with u and even when there&#39;s nobody for u..He&#39;ll be there..Don&#39;t fear GOD, instead love him...talk to him as if he&#39;s listening to u as friend...He is the greatest friend of all...Believe me it helps a lot....
Same go to hel dil
People troll me
I am in such a situation where it feels like you are totally empty, you really do want to feel any pain,  depression, anger any thing...any bloody thing. But all you have is an emptiness, a vast and dark emptiness. You want to cry to vent it out all but there is no tears in your eyes. You feel lost, empty, floating in the air...
12th grade academic pressure + Depression + No friends + toxic family relations + No motivation and energy + Bad sleep routine + pcos + escapism in the form of serials all day long = my life right now
Lying in bed at 4am trying to sleep for past 1hr and this is the song that i remember in these sad times
Harsh people who always bully me becoz I m too nice, getting beaten + elders criticizing me all times + fucked up college life + piled up with difficult subjects + no escape from harsh reality😭 really life is hitting me hard. This song has genuine feelings of a teenager
Not
Mko toh yhii smjh nhi aata ki kb mko koii hurt krta h toh mai kaise nhi so paati .. aur vhii dusre ko  kaise nind aa jaata h hurt krne yaa hurt hone k baad... 🥺🥺

Alia bhatt was phenomenal in this movie.
Same situation...now happend...🙂...boyfrnd cheated☺️
Failure in exams like jee, neet can also cause depression 😑
Hotel management + IT pressure + No support + Depression + Don&#39;t know what to do still try my best 🥺
Social media, fake social freinds, quest for becoming crorepati in a short amount of time to boost infront of freinds is the root cause of present age youth depression... infact this song itself is depressing one... western people have totally destroyed indian youths by making them trap in these bullshit social medias... i never seen any villagers in a state of depression
Sch bole to I&#39;m not a fan of hindi songs yet this song is so relatable with my current situation.💔💢
Love this
The movie expresses the life I live and I wish I had done the same. I went to a psychiatrist who understood me but there is no It will always be my favorite movie ❤
Literally stuck up, pata nahi kya karna Hain... Having a constant qn &quot;can I expect a better tomorrow?&quot; for the past few months, but recieved no answers and the situation is constant tho! 🙂

This movie made me cry so much because again I knew it&#39;s a movie it was supposed to have a happy ending and even tho I have the same story like her I&#39;ll never get that happy ending or the courage to accept everything and be happy and find little joys in life..
Not worth...to get depressed for anyone or for any other matter. I learnt , my life is precious for me. Love myself 💕
This song is something what I feel fucking everyday ... Errrrrrrr I hate this feeling
I hate my family
I&#39;m 2months of pregnant aur mujhe bhi aesa hi same feel horaha hai😔 I just hate myself
this comment section is most depressed out of all others
I wish everyone peace and happiness ♥️
Wanna cry badly but I can&#39;t....!!!
When u want to say something but no one cares
Well a classic I must say.A healer inhdr say.
Jiski hi trust karenge wohi torege trust... So dont trust anyone.. Only trust urself❤️
Bolo to pareshani na bolo to pareshani <br>Haso to pareshani na haso to pareshani<br>Aakhir kare to kya kare
Juthe  dill 🥺🥺

Sometimes people think that being in depression is just being sad for sometime or you just feel bad about some situation. And think that you will recover from it very soon. <br>Nowadays depression is just a joke for everyone, they think it&#39;s just a type of fever which only last for 2-3 days and after that the person becomes fine. <br>But NO that&#39;s not what depression really look like, you dont know what you are exactly feeling, everything around you feels so annoying, you are sad for no reason, everything feels so irritated you just want to go away from all the shits, you wanna leave everyone friends family. You feel anxious, sad, irritated at the same time and dont know what to happen. And being sad doesn&#39;t mean you are in depression, even a smiling face can also suffer many problem. Some people thinks that depression is mental health issues. LIKE SERIOUSLYYYY???? They are mentally disturb not mentally unstable. Stop saying all of these. <br>Even a person who makes everyone smile every day can be in depression! Stop neglecting depression it&#39;s a serious matter! You need to be serious<br><br>For all the people&#39;s who are mentally disturb or is in depression. <br>Dont worry! Believe in yourself you will be fine soon❤all the very best! 👍🏻

How many legendary people are listening this song in may 2022........
Relatable 😑
Hu khud se juda mein, hu khud se alehda👌

Slowly I realized that no one is good for you <br>Only you good for yourself
The whole world is in depression! Is there anyone happy? Instead of complaining, try search beautiful parts of my life! I am happy Today<br>Reason- supporting modern thought parents 😍<br>A complete family 😁<br>Yes financial problems are there but I will Manage if I get a job(still studying)<br> Single ( a big contribution in my happiness)<br> I enjoy my studies! I wish these things stay forever!(ofcourse except financial problems)
Perfect for me
Not only relationship problems. Family problems kills you from inside and most probably career tensions is the worst. 🙃
Koi mujhko mujhse hi bachade💔

Rubbish lyrics

The reason for my emotional and mental health is my school who always gives me depression. I sometimes feels will i ever be able to be normal after whatever happened. Depression is not just about break up, it can be because family problems, school, fake friends. Where u always think about ending your life but can&#39;t😭😢
No one notices ur sadness until it turns into anger &amp; then u are the bad person🥲💔
I really feel this song..I&#39;ve changed myself for those people whom I wanted to stay in my life.But now I&#39;ve lost myself completely and I feel like I don&#39;t exist🥲💔

Today I am listening this song........ feeling so depressed 😭......
The only reason I&#39;m not committing suicide is hamare Sare ristedaar yhi sochenge kisi ladke ka chakkar rha hoga isliye mar gyi lol
My fav movie
A boy in my class has crush on me but i have social anxiety they r trying to attract me to him they understood i have anxiety they r making fun off me😵
I am a girl i am. Having social anxiety people call me shy and make it fun what should i. Do i wanna kill myself
Listening to this  while reading comments  is kinda comforting , <br> Knowing that you are not alone  in this
At the end I only learnt one thing that there is not a single fucking soul whose gonna look after you in you worse not even your parents, you have to map your own way out from your worse..........🙂
Maturity is knowing your pain, physical or emotional , only belongs to you and no other person can be part of it.  You are all alone , is the eternal truth. Om Shivaya Namah 📿
Relating to every line doesn&#39;t feel good 🙆👀
I have been crushing over my senior at college its been 6 months since i started loving him I tried all ways to reach him..but today in that process i got to know that he is already in a relationship ..i always wanted to protect his precious smile and really wished that him to have that one person for him to go to when he is extrmly vulnerable.I am happy for him i really am...but something is really breaking my heart..i just want to stop these stupid thoughts that are coming up about him in mymind..you knw wts the worst part he nver knew i even existed!!!! and I can feel these lyrics  so much i am crying like crazy and i really hope this pain to end soon........
So thankful for this movie♥️ it can truely heal a person
👌 👌 👌
Always love yourself <br>Bhot log bolte h apna dil ka suna karo sb shi hoga lekin I say that jb aap apne dil ka sunne lgte ho aap apne aap ko khone lgte h aur jiske wjh se yeh hota h wo jb dur chla jaye we  start dying daily by inside outside <br>So please  never listen to ur heart <br>Always do what mind say 😊

Everyone is crying because of depression and sadness... But believe me... If you have a broken heart then listen songs which are fun.. YOU HAVE ONLY ONE LIFE TO LIVE 🧬 SO BE STRONG, GET UP AND FACE THE PROBLEMS AND THIS WORLD... <br>This shall pass too 💌 🤍🩹🤎
Never been alia fan but noone could give justice to this movie expect her😊
🙂🙂🙂
Sharminda Dil boht hua Rona.....
I wish depression ko log normally lene lage na ki ek bimari ki tarah. I just believe everyone needs someone to rely on at some point in there life💔
I think the film was a bit too ahead of its time.
I don&#39;t think I can handle this burden of responsibility and I keep running from it. I can&#39;t watch you with other people. See it how you like it . This will not change. And if you don&#39;t know how to get rid of me which seems like blurred truth... You know what Sue me. I&#39;m getting a job at shelke
Sorry ahead of time if I join a job and leave all this for good
I need money
Im going though this i can feel every word here cant relate more just numb💔
टूटे दिल टूटे दिल टूटे दिल just go to hell dil💔😔
this song reminds me..<br>That how I suffer from the worst situation of my life 🙃 really whenever I listen this song I remember how I suffer from those problems I couldn&#39;t imagine ki yr sahi Mai ...<br>Mai itni badi situation ko face ki akele🙃....<br><br>Now: <br>Dardo ki adat si lg gai hai😁<br>Aashu bhi meri hasi uady😌💔
Just today my bf told me that he and his two friends planed for a trip.. And hi and one of his friend&#39;s wife Will sleep in the same room.. I just cut the call and hearing this song.. I love him a lot.. Tears on my eyes.. People are so mean in this world
Just go to hell Dil...😒
This is the actual life of every teanger🥺we face a tons of things but how can we share this with our parents💔🥺even I trusted someone loved someone cared for him and he just left me like he don&#39;t fuckingly care...like how can someone do that🥺🥺💔💔I broke my parents trust my friendship for him and today he is happy with someone else💔💔💔💔🥺🥺🥺🥺
The painful fact is that I can relate this now💔
An insecure teenager throwing tantrums..It was shown earlier in the film that the character of Raghu played by Indian actor Kunal Kapoor had proposed to Kaira.Kiara did not accept his proposal and started dancing with a complete stranger to make Raghu look like an idiot. Later in the film, we find Raghu gets engaged to someone else and Kaira angrily storms into a departmental store and starts breaking pickle jars because the pickle jar also happens to have  the name &quot;Raghu&quot; inscribed on it. As viewers, why should we sympathize with such a rude, immature and downright cruel character? In real world,where people are suffering from serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, major depressive disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, these so called film directors deliberately make light of serious issues just to earn a quick buck.
🖤🖤🖤🖤
What they want to project? It’s ok to break pasta bottles in supermarket even if u pay the money?<br><br>Just to glamorize things for a hyped actress? Why can’t they make movies about how to work things out amicably?
Sunidhi Chauhan&#39;s Voice Seedhey Dil Mai💘
Expectation is the mother of pain
Love is really a fake word
Alia i like ur acting💓💓💓
Toxic family + no friends + every moment sucks + every day sucks + anxiety + depressed shit +and fake everything ...= my fucking life
Still one of my favourite ❤️
I am a girl who is not depressed(i think) but the feeling is very different i don&#39;t know what i am feeling right now<br>I have been body shamed(i am overweighted) before also but right now i am hating my looks, i got pimples and dark spot all over my face. The boy on whom i had a crush rejected me (i was not sad back then) but he told about this to many of my classmates and they started making fun of me and shaming me more on my body (this time i felt bad and now the things of my unknown sadness started)<br>Soon pandemic took over we were at home i got addicted to phone and my parents were not happy with it nor was i, slowly i realised that my studies are messed up<br>I want to change myself<br>I want to be happy agian<br>I want to be fit again, and get rid of pimples and dark spots<br>I want my studies to be good again<br>I have an aimless life rn<br>You know sometimes i feel like crying hard but can&#39;t cry<br>God pls help me 🙏
Haha...exactly this song related to my emotions....just go to hell..❤️
I just wanted u to be loyal with me. But you just hurt me again and again.but you r flirty kind of a person. So I never regret much because of you never loved me like the way I do for you
Some people should need to understand that sadness and depression are two different things don&#39;t take depression so lightly its one the the mental problems that some people are stuggling with.
As a teen i didnt clearly know how depression seems like and now I regret for not being there for my elder sister when she was going through her depression alone. I failed as a younger sister.
This literally define my condition .......my parents every day telling me that I don&#39;t have brain .....even if I study while night I won&#39;t be able to do anything
My life is ruined! I&#39;m depressed!!! I&#39;m lost!!!<br>My education my career  has become a Big❓ What a mess!!! My future!!! The f*ckin&#39; shit corona also ruined my life, I&#39;m depressed I lost some things for exams &amp; I start to hate things which I wanted &amp; loved &amp; waited finally earlier &amp; lost that too &amp; now regretting,guilt Omg what a messss!!!!! &amp; yah sleep is an escape to reality for the past 5 months &amp; for the past 1.5 even more worst, coz I lost my fav thing!!! Can&#39;t bear this!!! But what to do We are here fora reason It&#39;s do or a die! Guys we are all warriors let&#39;s fight off this battle! Guys I know My advice, not only mine anyone&#39;s advice would be Irritating @ the moment, But I hope I could help u, Just because u lost a thing don&#39;t get stuck there Itself move on find possible practical solutions that would work in reality, If not move on continue the life as earlier don&#39;t get struck there, coz u might lose more, u may feel what else to lose no Things that we think now is not important, later after letting it, might make u regret so try to enjoy every moment of life, spread +tivity, Love! I know it&#39;s difficult as hell but there&#39;s no choice left but to live, coz till your body is alive, we have to live. Sometimes After losing everything we&#39;ll get everything we wanted to get that thing but the thing we wanted is gone that wud hurt even more, making us to feel why did it happen, why did I do that, just go the flow!I know Loneliness + depression is something that is really difficult to describe with words, It&#39;s a mini hell! But We can overcome everything, We are strong!
Caring family + friends who I care but don&#39;t care back+my dream that the others don&#39;t like+hated by others friends+misunderstood by all+ fear of everything +suicidal thoughts +don&#39;t show anything to others +cry very badly in washroom and comes out like nothing happened +make others laugh by my silly jokes+keep others happy +awake at night with tears in eyes= My Beautiful Life🖤
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Were can I see it
Whenever I listen to this song I get goosebumps every teenager relate to this song we go through many things but just smile so anyone&#39;s mood cannot spoil but this song every teenager&#39;s feeling
Singer - JUST go to hell!!!! Dil!!!!! <br><b>After an heart attack 💔</b><br>Dil - And I took that personally
So relatable
This song is not about losing something, its just about not being able to do anything about your unreleased emotions, and when you know you&#39;re not understanding your emotions properly and no one in the world can understand, even you cant  explain anything to anyone, anyone being nice to you, you will feel to melt in their arms, and then the other moment you scream at them, its all unreleased emotions not able to find a way out.
After reading the comments I realised that Basically we all are suicidal people telling each other that suicide is not the solution😶
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Toote dil toote Dil <br>Just go to hell dil 💔
💔
How difficult to manage those people in life who brokes us everyday!!!!!   <br><br>      Just want to stay away from those but can&#39;t!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😭😭😭😭
I just listen to these song if I had a very bad day . I have to fit  this in my mind that  nobody&#39;s gonna save  you bc sometime even you don&#39;t have urself and u can&#39;t always be strong .<br>But everything is always wrong with me <br> I can&#39;t tell what&#39;s going on to  anyone cause my past tells me to not trust anyone . and people leaves u alone when u are  sad or telling them truth  <br>This world just hates good people and <br>I don&#39;t even have any friends , I lost all my friends And the worst thing is I can&#39;t even follow my dream bc of others exceptations . all I just want  to complete my dream but I just hate how things are going and as I wake up everyday I&#39;m just getting more tired and it make me so upset that I feel im not alive and im too scared . I don&#39;t even want to grow up within 3months im going to be 18 this year <br>I hate everything , I literally hate everything right now , my present and my past and im afraid of  my  future .
Every time when I think that it&#39;s enough of tolerance... I remind myself something better is waiting for me in future..... Wherever the hell are you right now, it will take you to your fairytale..... Just don&#39;t end it.
Whoever says everyone is happy these days.. just take a look at this comment section.. 💔
This time while way back home ..job pressure...fake people ..messed up life responsibilities and this song comes up don&#39;t know what to say where to go..!!!!

dipration thought
Ya it&#39;s true I am totally depressed , but I will never entertain a thoughts of suside  Never ! <br>I will fight !!
Its not always a heartbreak! I am just clueless what to do next. What am i suppose to do after this, couldnt sum up things going on rn. What about tomorrow? Again a new drama with a new day! How much will i escape by just sleeping? Sometimes im tired crying on same shit everyday. Whom should i share all this? People will judge and talk trash at the back. So just leaving this comment about the inside me! If you read this, then just thank you and i love you❤

Some ppl comes our life, destroy everything and don&#39;t even think or feel sorry what they&#39;ve did<br>They just think we deserve this! 😣😞😓😥😢
Most relatable video ever
Hugs to all the people facing this we will get this together.. It&#39;s a part of life we will come out to be stronger 💓
hi, I didn&#39;t had anyone to share this so I&#39;ll share it here.<br>I was depressed for a whole year and no one knew about it. I used to cry myself to sleep and never used to smile. always used to think how to end this. wanted someone to hug while crying but didn&#39;t had anyone to do so. until one day I met a boy and we became friends then bestfriend. he changed my life without even trying. after I met him, I noticed so many changes in me. I used to be happy and never cried after meeting him. but day before yesterday my brown family found about him and told me to not chat with anyone. They even took my phone from me. I didn&#39;t even talked with him from 1 day and idk what to do rn. I don&#39;t have any other friends. I only have him, who understands me, knows how to make me smile and inshort he is my happiness but no one is understanding this
Feeling like seeing older self,so much of things is changed now and all those days was hard but now it seems like nothing.....at certain stage of our life we are just strongly captured by our thought,emotions,feelings and desire ..and when it all burns out ..it&#39;s over you are grown out of it,more stronger more better ...
Now I  can feel the lyrics  of this song ....💔 Jus go to hell
I have really a lots of childhood  memories connected with   alia .I had danced on my school stage for dance competition on  alia&#39;s songs .i even got a price for that . The song. &quot; Love you zindagi&quot; and let&#39;s nacho ..touches my heart like anything...  One of Mine favourite song of alia is &quot; Radha teri chunnari &quot; which is also connected with my 4th nd 5th  standard  memories.. right now I am in class 12th . I mean almost gona complete ...<br>Love you alia for giving me a sweet memories through your songs .. even this song ..wow ... I started to like you so much ... ,,❤️❤️❤️❤️
Some people just feel they are depressed and don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen next and overthinkening is on another level and they just feel like crying and still smiling. hat&#39;s off to them . The most difficult thing is you are crying from inside and smiling from outside Luke nothing happened <br>Just you are so strong
I was just scrolling my Instagram and then just listen one line of the song and I feel so attached to song then I don&#39;t know the song name,  I just type dear zindagi song and found it . Just listening this song in loop and will when I will feel sad ❤.
I just can feel each and every line of this song 🎵  and just realized this song is just for me and I could feel the song 🎵 😩❤
The starting of the song will just make you feel so attached to the song and you will feel like you are there in the video and your heart will sing because you are not just listening you are feeling each and every line ♥ 🎶
I will just listen to this song when I will feel depressed and sad and sometimes not in good mood ❤🥺
Thank you for making this song
Sometimes music heals, lyrics kills 🙁
I just love the song 💕💕💕
Its very hard to survive where nobody is with us no body understands us , we are just living in this toxic and very judgemental society 🤫 . But one thing is I wanna say this to you. Everyone once in their life suffer from this no matter girl or boys . But when the life give u hundred to cry show that u have thousands reason to smile in your life 😇. Just be yourself , love yourself , learn how to live alone and become strong in those time so that not one could again enter to your heart to hurt to . Everything happens for a reason yrr so don&#39;t just question it why just relaxed and trust their process . And once you started loving yourself you don&#39;t waana be of anybody else people will just getting jealous of you . And once you recognise it you will know the value of life just all we have to do is now to have faith in yourself and have positive thinking <br>Love ❤️🌸🌻
Guys, this song can definitely can be called that this isn&#39;t a Song it&#39;s an emotion of millions and billion people around the world but especially,  in India. <br>Depression, Anxiety, Frustration, Headache, Cramps, Loneliness and many Mental health issues are there And thousands &amp; lakhs of people&#39;s suffers but our ill-litread society is full with shits &amp; dumb.<br>We make silly funn, memens and jokes of the suffers, it&#39;s really sas and shameful that we&#39;re still backwards in terms of Mentality. I&#39;m also among y&#39;all fortunately not that but going.<br>I wish all my luck, love, care, compassion, Respect, Joy, Enthusiasm and strength to all of you. No worries, We&#39;re warriors &amp; we&#39;ll overcome soon. <br>God bless y&#39;all and y&#39;rs families. Stay Blessed Amen. <br>Love you forever. <br>Myself, Sujal/18/Law Student/Bombay, MH, India. Thanks. ❤
Ekdin shob thik hoye jabe In Sha Allah🙂❤

Don&#39;t wear saree at salve boy
Kuch nhi badla
Society is always like this .....that you are not perfect ..... and compares you with others ...... it&#39;s hurt 💔
Sometimes stranger&#39;s are better than your own family and friends 😌🤞
It&#39;s a great movie must get an Oscar
Anyone with depression can relate to this song 💯🙌
I feel that my generation or my age people really fucked up with their life 🤕

🥺🥺i just want to die now...
She is one of the best fruit of nepotism. Idk why people judge her soooo much. She is a brilliant actress ❤️
Alia was phenomenal in the movie ❤️🙌
The mental pressure that happens to face when you don&#39;t know what to do and there is nothing that anybody could do to help you out
Being not loved by the one whom u heartfully liked, but they pretend to be vth  u as they want people to let know as they have someone hu liked them,,, but they love someone else whom they didn&#39;t marry, it&#39;s a situation like living body vth dead soul
🎈🎈
I love this starting music which makes my heart melts soo much
It feels like I could see myself in this video :)
The most worst thing ever when you broke up with yourself
I Hate my life and me.
The most underrated song🙂💔

Loneliness is the root cause..
I hate my life now 🙂..<br>Just wanna go hell

To those you are in depression or very unhappy , stressed <br><br>Hi dear,<br>I know you are having a tough time but you know what you are enough strong to deal with this. I know you are feeling low, depressed and sad. But always remember this is for very short <a href="http://time.ups/">time.Ups</a> and downs are necessary in life. Try to enjoy every curve of it. When life throws your back, then get up and tell that you are ready to face everything because you are very strong. You shouldn&#39;t give up in this low phase if you want to enjoy the high phase. To take a higher jump we have to bend first. So now life has made you bend because it is preparing you for a higher <a href="http://jump.so/">jump.So</a> get ready for it. Don&#39;t give up.I know it will be not so easy . It might take some time. But I also know that you can do it.<br>          Yes <br>YOU CAN DO IT<br><br>Share your feelings with others. Please <br>Stay strong.. I know u can do it
Again i m 🙂

Toxic family+ irritating relatives+ fake/ no friends + messed up education + suicidal thoughts =mah life
Still depressed
💔
मेरी एक दोस्त आलीया जैसी है

I don&#39;t really understand why most of the North hates her. She&#39;s actually a pretty amazing actress. Most of her movies are really different and great stories.
Same
In 2016 when this masterpiece released, I was in the lowest phase of life, just finished college, completely lack of direction, lack of support, peer pressure, being underestimated, bad relationship with family, cant get over someone after 1 year breakup. I was never in state where I feel I need to escape this life, because I was never easily give up.<br>5 years after that, things changed, and this is very huge that reminded me again to this movie. I remember crying so hard in the middle of the night like I can burn my throat after seeing this movie. Thanks to whoever made this.
I feel like there&#39;s nothing left in my life to be happy anymore. Everyday am not living but mere surviving. I start doing smethn,put my full potential in cmpleting it and then smehw it doesnt work out at the end..it feels like am tryin nd tryin jz to fall back to square 1. Idk if there is anyone who understands me. Ek toh ye covid, upar se online studies,career wise bhi kuch growth ho nhi rahi inspite of a lot of hardwork. Stuck at home, away from the outside world, ithni sadness bhari hui he zindagi main ki i have lost the urge to wake up and kick off! Evryday feels just the same. I dont even recognise myself anymore. I have lost myself smewhere and am not able to find myself. Lots of complicated thoughts, sleepless night, its just this song that has been my constant companion. Cheers to the makers of Dear zindagi!
Keep going <br> I used to listen this song on those days and relate with lyrics and thought this song was made for me😔<br>U can overcome this💜💜💜💜💜💜
Mymomhatesme
Currently I&#39;m facing loneliness fear of being judged self esteem self hate future ki tention nd so on hopefully jo bhi meri trh ye sb feel kr rh h jldi unsbki life m happiness aaye 😌🥰😇

Messed up education + broken heart + family issue + irritating relatives + fake/no friends + humiliation + suicidal thoughts = My life 🙂
I have OCD from last nine years and I want to be just like normal people.
Same situation has happened to me 😭😭😭
😑
It&#39;s 2021 let&#39;s see how many people will come here to listen this
Sry to myself...Mene kabhi tumare khayal nhi rakha na socha na tume isk qabil banaya k tum jo chao jisko chao wo tume mil jaye... Syad ish wajese tume wo kuch nhi mili ajtak jo tum cahte the... Maf kr dena my dear ME🙂
tut chuki hu pori tarah..q hota hai bar bar aysa mere sath
Cbse have doomed my career... And I&#39;m here... 🙂
No one is talking about Sunidhi&#39;s typical voice which made that song literally a gem. Sunidhi is just...... no words💓
Singles, you cannot even imagine how bad a terrible relationship pains, better adore yourself and stay healthy and sound..... Otherwise it feels hell to just look at any random thing, everything thing sucks
Family can make a totally different person ....... who is just emotionless &amp; cold hearted ....... and they they are going to judge you for this all what actually they have did ...................
Bloody 🐶 people are dying worldwide without food.
:)
Parents doesn&#39;t Understand that Their Child Also Have Dreams They&#39;re Not A Robot Who can Fulfill Their Other personalities!🙂
When u r restricted by ur family for so many things and bcm depressed af 😩koi mujhko mujhse hi bachaye feels now 😭

I fear that I’ll fail again tomorrow
Yehan se kahan jaaon, kahan mein chup jaaon.........💔💯.......I can feel this🥺😭😭😭😭
I am here again today.. with eyes full of tears.. i dont know where this will lead to.. i dont know.. i have no control over what i am living..all i can see is my whole life imposed by the people around me.. i want to scream..maybe i will not be strong or maybe ill become more stronger.. but i really want to know when things will get btter....
I care about everyone , everybody <br>Why I can&#39;t care of me ??? <br>May I learn to care of my self
Jb Girls Sad hoti H Tb ye song sunti h
I am getting mad<br>I don&#39;t know what to do<br>I don&#39;t have any other option <br>Without sucide<br>Every one fucked me up😅😅
Toxic relatives + messed up with studies + suicidal thoughts + fake friends = my life 😔
This is the only one song of Aaliya Bhatt, which I like the most!!! 🌼
Yes just go to hellllllll 💔
Expectations from others...kills us only
I relate to this song now<br><br>I&#39;ll come back for sure IA one day to announce that I no more relate to it ,I&#39;ve passed on that phase...
❤❤

What feels bad you know - you wanna cry but you&#39;re scared to not cry in front of your parents, family, sometimes friends and still in alone too you won&#39;t find peace though to cry a bit... I know it sounds low and depressing but for right now I&#39;m all left with these feelings inside me every here and then i feel so frustrated, annoyed and screwed all the time. 💔🥺
Same just just meri zindagi bhi ayse hi chal rhi he ise bhi bekar 😭😭😭😔😔
My Current condition ... I don&#39;t know what to do....I loss all my happiness and confidence 💔
Losing  father at the age of 9, having depression at childhood, having problems in family, messed up education, fake friends,messed up life 🙂This is really<br> Me 💔😊🙂😀<br><br>Alone....😔💔<br><br>Edit:-Loved someone truly and got heartbroken 💔 The leftover I had on myself also gone 💔 😊 After 2 years I am again on the same track 😊😊😊
Lyrics......
I fell this situation
I&#39;m madly in love with him..but it&#39;s getting hard to make it work ..i wanted to make him understand ..but he with his ego  , never want to understand ..so break up thoughts making me terrible ..i can&#39;t even take it ... Neither say it to him..hope he will understand ..i become quiet ... can&#39;t take this pain anymore ... I&#39;m exhausted !
It&#39;s me😣
Some days back I was about to get a therapy but couldn&#39;t and switched by overburdening myself but whenever someone tells me their story or when I listen to these songs then nothing helps! It just feels heavy some days!!
Just go to hell marks, friends, relatives , world...
The best truth  in this fake world is we can&#39;t trust anyone....if it is your family or others..stay alone and stay strong...then feel it..yes I am like that...I love myself🤧😊😊and I know what I am doing😑hope everything will be alright🥀😊that&#39;s why l just come here for this masterpiece☺
🥺🙏
Merey rasta ter ho gaya!
Hey don&#39;t worry you are not only the one who cried a lot in the mid night... Searching for this type of songss I m also with you. I don&#39;t no where I have to go with whom I want to share this n all.... That&#39;s y i came here simply listening.... Darkroom + headset +tears in my eyes + remembering memories 💔💔
Toxic parents + bad best frds + bad memory + tension of career + fake smile from outside😞🙃 =  my life
I miss being happy 😭
Optimism + hope + patience + positive outlook + love challenges and learning from them + self-reliance + faith in God + love the people = my life 🤍
I don&#39;t care how she is in normal life but she is pretty good in acting

When I get angry or when I get hurt from some one than I to the same thing some time life doesn&#39;t give us a second chance 😥😥😥

When you can&#39;t control your fucking idiotic ,destructive thoughts  emotional feelings  <br>You are finished .
Don&#39;t say any bad word from your mouth like fu *k etc because it s a sin and it s consequenc is very hard in The Holy Bible God forbade us from this and also tell us about that on judgment day the judgment of words will happen.
I am so frustrate from life sometimes I wish I would wish like an tipper would ruin out me from this painful reality.I am done with all these stuffs &amp; all😭😭😭
This song remind me of one girl who is very special to me but we are not together anymore !
Whatever you&#39;re going through that will pass. Hold on
Dear.. please go to psychologist or psychiatrist.. if you are feeling you are not okay.. don&#39;t punish your self... Happiness is just behind you .. if you cannot find by yourself it so take help nah baby...
I forgot how to feel every emotion except anger and frustration, that too at nothing.
My  favourite song. .
I love this song
This movie is really amazing, the acting is sooo good! Alia is too good in this. For people going through hard yes it&#39;s a must watch. It&#39;s like a warm hug to self!I&#39;m surprised this didn&#39;t achieve mainstream success, some of the scenes are too realistic and relatable.
Sunidhi Chauhan voice 🔥
yaa just go to hell😢
There&#39;s a big hole inside me, no matter what I do i can&#39;t fill it
😭😭😭😭😭😓😔😓😔😓😔😓😔😖😖😖😖😖 i m having so much bad tines now......the one whom i love isnt talking at allll!!!!!! M suffering from sever back pain....no job😖😭 no relatives( they r but snakes r better than them) ....no cousins, no friends......cant go out..... Cant walk ...cant sit. ......my life is hell from past 9 months.....<br>I m not able to stop myself from thinking abt the person whom i liked.......he says nothing ...but ignoring my messages....<br>I just cry same as ALIA in this movieeeeee.....😭😔 i wish for suicide
Heart touching.. 🥺
Hell hell hell hell hell ..... 🤜🏻🤜🏻🤜🏻🤜🏻😓🤯🥱🥱😪🤒😡😕🤔
She portrayed this phase,soo well
Nowadays depression may have come out as a topic but most people talk like it&#39;s nothing and make fun of it.....<br>People who are suffering doesn&#39;t open up easily to let others know Or to help them<br>Cause they don&#39;t know how to communicate about it to others and they are not even sure that even if they do so... Do others will listen or will they care?? <br><br>It&#39;s just sometimes... We don&#39;t need any advice or sympathy<br>We just need someone to understand us, to hear us<br><br>And so it&#39;s important to understand and listen to our friends atleast we can behave like humans to them even if it&#39;s the dumbest student of our class Or the loser that&#39;s popular and complains about everything to ok their own insecurity .. <br>cause u never now who is going through what<br>U can&#39;t scan the smile who had cried all nights the day before...!
This is so me yaar
14 years old - I am broken not from love but from my life . My head pains and my life sucks . I am myself sad and depressed everytime for almost no reason . I am a good student but now I get anxiety from exams . I start breathing very fast as I am loosing . I don&#39;t want to give up I have lot&#39;s of dreams to be fulfilled . But I am not the same aspiring girl I used to be .I am sad ,sorry for myself .I am breathing hard  and my headache continues to bother me . I don&#39;t think I am able withstand my parents expectations and the most important mine . When once I tried to tell my mom about my depression she said It has become a new trend of the younsters . There&#39;s noone who could hear me say . So ,I writing this here - that&#39;s my life
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎼🎼
I just got a breakup with my best friend <br>I feel soo broken inside.
It is now more than 9 years now since depression first hit me. And it has taken a lot from me my life, i don&#39;t even understand to smile or laugh in reality. Everything just feels so numb. I wish i wasn&#39;t born.
Koi muj ko muj se hi bachayee❤️ love this song
Crying and broken from inside but still the most laughing and entertaining frd among the circle ☺️🥺🥺
Pain.  Of. ...🎧🎼♥🎼🎧
Sometimes u can&#39;t talk to anyone 😞<br>about your feelings.
Among all of you i am the biggest fool and idiot because i make people priority, trust them, like them. And they intelligent people just broke it like nothing. But NOW I AM A HUMAN WITH NO FEELINGS,but yes i am most happy and smiling person for the world. People say me i am changed,no i am broke.🙂
&quot;Koi mujhko mujhse hi bachaye&quot; <br>This line hits different when you can&#39;t help but overthink every damn thing.😔
Sab kharab kr liya maine..itni acchi love story thi..na she doesn&#39;t want to return 💔 Just go to hell Dil

These songs belong with me and it is related
I exist bcz I can&#39;t die
I come here everyday. I have decided that I&#39;ll rant my pain out in the comments until it subsides or ends. Maybe that can help me feel heard, coz this comment section makes me feel related to every single one of you.
I forgave him. Even after I found out 8 major lies he had spoken to me in our relationship of 1 year. He insulted me, made fun of my feelings, called me mean names, disrespected me, ruined my self respect, manipulated me and I still stayed. In the end, he had the audacity to blame it all on me, and he left. He left as if I meant nothing to him. And now I&#39;m feeling that he left me for another girl. Love sucks!! He&#39;s the shittiest person in this whole wide world!! I trusted him with all my heart, loved him with all of me, and forgave him sacrificing my peace of mind!! I had so many sleepless nights, I still do, I am not eating properly, not able to study, not able to process a thing!! All coz of that bastard!! And I hate tf out of him!! He&#39;ll face the same!! Karma is a bitch!! He is a hypocrite, a player, a f**kboy, and the worst person in this whole wide world!!! I feel sorry for this world that he exists!! But one day, he&#39;ll face the same!!! And he&#39;ll know, who sent this karma to him!! He&#39;ll gasp for breaths at his death just how I gasped in between sobs!! He&#39;ll be ruined!!! He&#39;ll beg for forgiveness from heavens! He&#39;ll die inside!!!<br><br>Also, to anyone reading this, I&#39;m sorry for so much of abusing, and pouring so much out. Please understand. My mental state sucks rn! Thankyou!♥️
Again back here💀
&quot;Depression isn&#39;t just being a bit sad..or listening sad songs...It&#39;s feeling nothing...it&#39;s feels like completely empty....It&#39;s not wanting to be alive anymore.&quot;🥺💔

Nice song....
Bad guys.. They aren&#39;t sure of their feelings.. Thier games failed terribly... Without me doing any wrong suffered by thier harassment.. Constanr gossip spreading rumors.. Indeed all those words are right for my situation now.. Include bad guys who entered my life.. Family is toxic.. I have no friends. Had fake ones so true.. Those genuine ones are distant now. True what about guys in my life?? Aren&#39;t they bitter and self obsessed..??? Without any communication how can a guy be so mean to me?? Anyone to question??.. They liked me they followed me they saw me.. When personality clashes aroused whole situation messed up.. Guys arent humans?? Are they egostic dolls or something!!!????? How did they help me?? Jerks  one played with me emotionally.. Now I&#39;m totally out or it. He&#39;s still gossiping around and believes in the same shit forever I have a heart or a machine??? 0yoi don&#39;t type here you better type in your phone enough is enough...

Whoever is broken here have a good laughter with weired face when feel like crying..
This movie had released just the day before my birthday and now I know why. My emotions, my story had been beautifully presented to me and came as a gift through this movie. This movie would always remain close to my heart. If kaira can come out of the trauma and depression so can I. She inspired me.
I am just stuck between my dream choosing and it kills me inside, I don&#39;t know what should I do I ask myself but my heart also dont reply and I don&#39;t know what to do and what not
This film and song broked us, made anxious but gave us hope of letting things go at last.
My feeling shows here
Why can&#39;t I get a friend like mee..
Can relate with this anxiety .None should invest on unrequited
FRIENDS ; I wish I had one  real one 🙃💔
Aasu bhi meri hasi udaye. 🙂
I don&#39;t care what people say about you alia for me your acting skills are phenomenal

You know this feeling, when you are already on your death bed because of excessive crying and your heart wants more of the crying session. Well that&#39;s me and depression I guess 💔
Alia was amazing 🔥

https://youtu.be/xZI9vx4zR6I
All comments shows that I&#39;m not alone 😭
No other actress cries on screen like Alia does ❤️ this girl deserves everything ❤️
Why love is hurt <br>Fuck this pain<br>I know he won&#39;t read my message he doesn&#39;t like Hindi songs<br>I love him <br>If destiny was reading this plz plz make him my one and only and my end with him
he left me, I cut my hand, was sick, begged him cried every mint and he left. So this was love?? He&#39;ll not care even if I die. Why the hell he came in my life begged me to say yes and left me alone. He was the only person who was soo close. Plz pray for me, I want him in my life again. I don&#39;t want to love again.
Dil should go to hell coz this is main reason for all pain

Before seeing the comments of this song I would feel I am the most sad person but after seeing all the comments I realised you all have even more than double pain compared to me I hope you all will be fine ❤️❤️
This doesn&#39;t feel like a depressing song.its more healing specially when you&#39;re going through a tough phase. you feel as if someone understands 😔

Teenagers are the most ignored generation, but they go through a lot in these years, they grow as a person mentally and physically which sometimes gets overwhelming for them, here, so many teenagers are venting on a comment section hope they&#39;d had someone who would listen to them ❤️
I&#39;m depressed because I&#39;m 38 &amp; virgin... 😔
Khudse naraj hu....suna ky ha bilkul shi suna jindgi....m ky kru....btana....kyu aise kr diya
Fuckedup studies + lack of confidence + insecurities + bloody hell relatives + poor at communication = my life
When the chaos outside is so loud that I can&#39;t hear myself and feel the inner peace. This song is a wonder! To keep believing in oneself and most importantly to love yourself for who you&#39;re..
Her expression like real ❤
Just go to hell dillllllll ✨<br>Kafi phle hi ye line bol di apne dil ko maine 😌
The fact that i have cried so much and now tears are not flowing out of my eyes is like a superpower. People seem to think i am heartless but the truth is that i am so done that it just does not hurt anymore. I have been betrayed by people whom i believed the most. This song is too relatable.
Whoever is here to listen this song is going through something so strange in their life.
This comment section makes me feel like I&#39;m not the only one !!!
I am upset becoz of my friend
Love u Alia❤❤
I&#39;m sorry Jaana😞🙏
I want to go a peaceful place and want to cry alone no one
Wowo nice
Shows reality of a broken girl😖
Sadness alot of answers running through..!<br>Depression alot of questions running through..!!..
:-(
Has passed through this
Just hell in here tooo............😂🤣
same situation Alia dee🥺🥺
I suddenly remember about this song after I got another rejection of my internship application yesterday.. I even forgot how many times I got &quot;no&quot; words during this three weeks...
For We all have sinned and turned away from God, we can&#39;t connect to God anymore. But God so Loved the world that He gave His only Son for us that through Him we may be Healed and have eternal life and He was Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God and God Himself who gave up His life for us as a Holy Sacrifice on the Hill of Calvary, all for us, He was beaten and pierced and Through his stripes we are healed, Because of Him the broken relationship between God and man (because of sin) has now been restored, all our sins which were too much to be forgiven on basis of deeds now is forgivable all because of Him, Therefore Brethren now REJOICE FOR THE PRICE HAS BEEN PAID!! NOW ALL WE&#39;VE TO DO IS TO REPENT AND TURN TO GOD THAT THIS SACRIFICE MAY BE APPLIED ON US AND THAT THROUGH HIM WE MAY ATTAIN SALVATION AND ETERNAL LIFE AND A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE OUR GOD!!<br>BLESSED BE HIS NAME FOREVER AND EVER❤✝️<br>(obviously every decision is upon you, as you wish, may it happen, all i can is pray for you, that He may soften your heart and reveal all knowledge of the Gospel at the right time)<br>GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES AND ALL AROUND YOU ABUNDANTLY <br>AMEŅ❤❤✝️
Right now totally broken 🙂 and just listening this song 🙂
My friend just hurted me badly 😓.<br>I was crying Infront of her, I have done Everything.<br>In return she was saying I&#39;ll report you and using bad language.
